 Isn't she gorgeous? Spring is when our thoughts turn to fried clams. Really good ones are hard to come by in the five boroughs, so yesterday we headed out to Rockville Center on Long Island to Bigelow's New England Fried Clams, recommended by Serious Eats. Bigelow's has been in the same spot since the 1930s, and its interior doesn't look like it has changed much since then—one small room with a horseshoe shaped counter and wooden beamed walls. Almost everything on the menu is fried, and sizzle of hot oil frequently bubbles up from the row of fryers. The fried clam plate is made with the Ipswitch variety, and comes with either fries or slaw. The clams are fat and briny and the crispy coating is thin and delicate; it just needs a little bit of salt. The plate costs $22, which seems high, but Ipswitch clams are expensive these days, and anyway, beggars can't be choosers. Bigelow's New England Fried Clams 79 N Long Beach Rd Rockville Centre, NY (516) 678-3878

Where to Eat off the Jersey Turnpike

POST:
 The New York Times opened up a readers comments thread devoted to places to eat (other than fast food) off the Jersey Turnpike. We ourselves have been so hungry while stuck in traffic on the turnpike, that we have resorted to Sbarro's pizza, which is almost better than starving, but not by much. Predictably, there are a few winners who didn't understand the question ("Taco Bell!) or who would like to remind you that you should always pack a brown bag lunch instead. But there are some good tips in the bunch—one points us to Newark's Portuguese and Brazilian neighborhoods, and one mentions a dive bar called Jay's Elbow Room, off the exit to Philly, where great Swiss patty melts can be had.

The Great Cornflake Chivda Taste-Off
AUTHOR:
Sarah DiGregorio
DATE:
2008-03-27 8:21:00
POST:
 Chivda (pronounced "chew-da) is like Indian chex mix, but better, and with many more variations. Some kinds are made with toasted, flattened rice, some with bhel or sev (short, deep fried noodles), fried potato sticks, nuts, lentils and dried fruit. Many feature some or all of those elements, and they are all heavily spiced. My favorite kind is cornflake chivda, which is exactly what it sounds like: cornflakes mixed with other various crunchy things (see above), fried in spiced oil. Chivda should be crunchy, not greasy. It should have a good balance of spicy, sweet, salty and sour tastes, and each mouthful should have a nice mix of all the elements—cornflakes, lentils, nuts, etc. And although it should be spicy, it shouldn't be so overwhelming that you can't munch on it comfortably. So which cornflake chivda is the fairest of them all? Meet your contestants (and where they are made): 1. Surati (Canada) 2. Haldiram's (India) 3. Swad (India) 4. Masst (US) 5. Mirch Masala (US) 6. Joy (US) 7. KCB (US) All are available at Patel Brothers in Jackson Heights. We tasted all the chivda blind, not knowing which was which. After lots of crunching, Haldiram's emerged victorious in the race for Best Cornflake Chivda, in a vote of 3 for and 1 against.  Haldiram's had a fresh, crispy crunch and a good mix of elements: cornflakes, potato sticks, cashews, green lentils and raisins. "This tastes like something my mom would make," said a taster of Indian heritage. Haldiram's had a nice balance between sweet and hot, and also featured the sour flavor that some mixes were missing—probably because it has mango powder in it—and the low, slightly sulphurous funk of asafoetida. Surati, the Canadian entry, was also a favorite, with crunchy peanuts and cashews, but was definitely the sweetest of the bunch, with lots of cinnamon and a peanut buttery flavor. Swad was tasty, but with too many different spices bouncing off each other in an overwhelming way. It tasted strongly of mustard seeds, curry leaves, turmeric and asafoetida. It was also the oiliest. But it gets points for having large slivers of toasted coconut. Unsurprisingly, we found that the versions made in the US were generally less complex, and less spicy. Joy, however, was one taster's favorite of all. He liked the texture of the cornflakes, thicker and crunchier than others, and the assortment of nuts and sesame seeds. "I like the sound of number five," said one taster, as she ran her spoon through the Mirch Masala version. This one did have the nicest texture, with very large, crisp cornflakes, studded with raisins. It had a clean, corn and lentil flavor, but was lacking in the spice department. Masst's version had a strange, chemical aftertaste. KCB's version was dotted with lentils colored an unearthly green, and was too salty. There you have it folks. Perhaps the world's first blind taste test of cornflake chivda. Did we miss your favorite? Drop me a line.

Fork in the Road Explores Hunts Point Eats

POST:
 This week, FitR brings you to the South Bronx neighborhood that feeds the city—Hunts Point. The vast wholesale fish, meat and produce markets in Hunts Point make up the largest food distribution center in the world. These markets are the most vital link in the supply chain that carries food to New York. Much of the food you're buying in markets or eating in restaurants comes through the markets, which operate all night to ship food to the sleeping city. So, where to eat in the neighborhood that feeds the city? We found an amazing broccoli rabe hero, crackly-skinned pernil, great Southern-style barbecue, and outrageously delicious (and cheap) Dominican salt cod stew. We also met a refugee from the Manhattan restaurant world who worked for Donatella Arpaia for years, but left to open his own spot on Hunts Point Avenue, close to where he grew up. The neighborhood looks industrial and gritty, but it's not the dangerous place it used to be. Now, it seems more like a small town, where the cops can be persuaded not to write a parking ticket if they know you well enough. There's also great people-watching (and plenty of strip clubs). What's not to love?

POST:
 This week, Our Man reviews Marcus Samuelsson's new pan-African restaurant, Merkato 55. He finds much to recommend, an endorsement that should carry a lot of weight, given Our Man's longtime interest in African cuisine. Our Man reminds us not to fear the Meatpacking location (or MePa, as it is lately, and annoyingly, called). "Herman Melville wandered the cobbles long before Lindsay Lohan," he writes. Onward! Among the Ethopian selections, Our Man finds that the doro watt has "marvelous depth of flavor" and the kitfo, a beef tartare cooked just slightly with hot, spiced butter, has a "wild richness." The foie gras chutney is less successful, causing Our Man chase little bits of liver around the bowl. Don't make Our Man chase little bits of liver around the bowl! The pita bread also meets disapproval—"cardboardy material that might better be sent to the troops in Iraq as body armor," Our Man helpfully suggests. All in all, though, Our Man admires Chef Samuelsson's sweeping, continent-wide scope, and wonders if this restaurant will make African food the Next Big Thing.

In Search of Vada Pav
AUTHOR:
Sarah DiGregorio
DATE:

POST:
 I recently visited Mumbai to meet my fiancé's extended family, and I've come back with an unfortunate craving for vada pav (pronounced "wada pow"). There are many delicious street cart foods in New York, but vada pav is conspicuously absent. Wada pav is to Mumbai as hot dogs (or maybe even pizza) are to New York. It's a regional favorite, adored by people from every walk of life and eaten as a snack or small meal anytime, usually at a fast food place or from a street vendor. It's like a spicy fried potato fritter sandwich, although that doesn't quite do it justice (and the picture above doesn't do it justice either). You start with a mixture of spiced potato, mashed roughly together and flavored with mustard seeds, curry leaves, green chiles and other spices. That potato mixture is shaped into balls, dipped in a batter and deep-fried until golden and crisp—that's your "wada." The "pav" is simply a soft, white roll, usually painted with butter and griddled until lightly toasted. Put the wada inside the pav, dollop on a couple chutneys and serve a fried green chile on the side, and you have a wada pav—a "snack" that will sit heavily in your stomach all day, so that you almost regret eating it, but not quite. I heard that Sukhadia's on 45th Street has wada pav, so I went up there for lunch today. Alas, I was thwarted.  The woman at Sukhadia's counter told me that she makes the wadas everyday, but they had sold out (this was at about 1pm). I contented myself with pav bhaji—vegetable curry served with the toasted, buttered pav on the side, above. It was good for a quick lunch, but not great. I'll be searching Jackson Heights for proper vada pav, so if anyone knows of a good place to get it, drop me a line. In the meantime, if you want to get vada pav in Manhattan, get to Sukhadia's early! Sukhadia's Gokul 17 West 45th Street 212 395-7300

You can find a passable vada pav at Agneths Express in Jersey City. Patel Snacks, "The King of Vada Pav," made the best version on the Little India strip, but the business changed hands about a year ago, and I can't speak for the version at what's now Rim Zim's Big Bite.

Most Creative Peanut Butter Sandwich

POST:
 Behold the Most Creative Peanut Butter Sandwich! Today at the Culinary Loft in SoHo, Jif held its sixth annual Most Creative Peanut Butter Sandwich Contest. Emerging victorious was 11-year-old Samuel Sosa, who is sixth grade at Loma Vista Middle School in Riverside, California. Sammy won a $25,000 college scholarship fund. And his sandwich looks pretty great. The recipe after the jump. Crunchy Chinese Fortune Cookie Sandwich Yield: 4 sandwiches Ingredients: Chinese Dipping Sauce: 1/4 cup Jif Creamy Peanut Butter 1/4 cup coconut milk 1 tablespoon soy sauce 1 tablespoon brown sugar 1 tablespoon lemon juice 1/2 teaspoon sesame oil 1/2 teaspoon chili powder 4 slices of wheat bread Sandwich Mix: 3 tablespoons Jif® Creamy Peanut Butter 1 tablespoon finely diced celery 1 tablespoon finely diced apple Directions: To make the dipping sauce, combine all ingredients in small saucepan and cook over low heat while stirring with a wire wisk. When the mixture starts to bubble and thicken, remove from heat and let cool. While the dipping sauce is cooling, roll flat with a rolling pin the four slices of bread. Use a large circle shaped cookie cutter to cut out each slice of bread into a circle. Mix the 3 sandwich mix ingredients together in a small bowl. Place a tablespoon full of mix into the center of each circle shaped piece of bread. Fold the bread in half so the sandwich is now a half circle. Crimp the edges of the sandwich together with your fingers so the mix will not come out. Then, while holding the center of the sandwich, pull the sides of the sandwich down so the edges touch each other, forming a fortune cookie shape. Cut extra apple and celery slices to eat with the Chinese dipping sauce. To make fortunes for your fortune cookies, use a clean plastic lid from a tub of butter, yogurt, or sour cream. Cut small plastic strips, then write your fortune on them with a permanent marker. Tuck the edge of the fortune into the edge of your cookies to make them real fortune cookie sandwiches. Once the dipping sauce is cool, serve the crunchy Chinese cookie sandwiches with their fortunes, and apple and celery slices on a plate with a cup of dipping sauce. Dip the sandwiches and the apple and celery slices into the sauce, and you have a great after school snack that was fun to make and eat!

The Great Chopped Liver Taste-Off
AUTHOR:
Sarah DiGregorio
DATE:
2008-03-20 8:13:00
POST:
 Liver-haters, avert your eyes. Chopped liver tastes a lot better than it photographs. But who makes the best chopped liver in the city? I recruited an intrepid group of tasters to blind taste six iconic versions—the good, the bad and the ugly after the jump. Meet the contestants: Fairway Zabar's Russ and Daughters 2nd Avenue Deli Eagle Provisions (a small Polish market on 5th Avenue in south Park Slope) Katz's We set out six little bowls of the stuff, and started tasting, not knowing which was which. Predictably, much of the judging is a matter of taste—eggs or no, strong livery taste or mild, smooth or chunky? But after much debate, and many bad jokes (what am I...?), we crowned Russ and Daughters and Katz's the joint title holders of Best Chopped Liver. We liked Russ and Daughters for its bits of caramelized onion, clean, mild livery taste and judicious amount of chopped boiled egg. Katz's had an appetizing consistency—light and almost fluffy—and a nicely balanced sweet-savory flavor. As for the others, Eagle Provisions (the only non-icon in the bunch) had a surprisingly strong showing. Their chopped liver was assertive without being overwhelming, coarse and meaty. I'm sorry to say that I hated 2nd Avenue Deli's chopped liver. I'm sure that makes me a complete chopped liver idiot in many people's minds, but there it is. That version was very dark and dense, and tasted overwhelmingly livery. One taster noted that it was the most authentically Eastern European of the bunch. Zabar's version was also polarizing—its big dose of chopped egg was enjoyed by some and hated by others. One taster said it tasted of sulphur, and the liver-hater in the group (who bowed out of the tasting) said he couldn't think of anything worse than sulphurous chopped liver. I liked the eggy flavor, but each to his own. Fairway's chopped liver was solidly run-of-the-mill, prompting no strong reactions either way. Did we miss your favorite chopped liver place? Email me and let me know.

There's a brand sold in the freezer section of supermarkets called International Glatt. It's made from beef liver, so it's got a much stronger taste than chicken liver. I think it's better than any liver I've tasted from any store.

Just had some Barney Greengrass chopped liver today - truly really very good. I have not tried Russ & Daughters but will sometime soon though I'm not a huge fan of too much egg!

Whole Foods Nixes Plastic Bags For Good

DATE:

POST:
 A co-worker tipped us that the Whole Foods Bowery location was not offering plastic bags anymore, as of today. We called the store and were told that all Whole Foods stores nationwide will be cutting out plastic bags by April 22, but that the bags are not being manufactured anymore, and the New York warehouse has run out of them—hence, no more plastic bags in NYC. This is definitely the direction all stores will trend towards, some more slowly than others. In January, the city council passed a bill that would allow shoppers to bring plastic bags back to stores to be recycled. This will take effect in about 6 months.

I understand that they are looking out for the environment, but it's impractical to only have paper bags. Yesterday's inclement weather + walking several blocks to get to the train then home was disastrous.

Fork in the Road Loves Paté
AUTHOR:

POST:
 Loving paté is not a going-out-on-a-limb type opinion to have, we know, but we really do love us a good paté. Those of you who feel the same way should save up your pennies and get yourselves over to Bar Boulud. For FitR's column this week, we're reviewing Daniel Boulud's new temple to charcuterie and wine. It was interesting to see that many critics acknowledged that Bar Boulud's charcuterie is amazing, but nevertheless didn't give it much love—see NY Mag and Time Out NY. (With the notable exception of The Bruni). It's true that many of the entrées are merely skillful, not inspired, and that several of them are not even skillful. But you feel that the place's heart (and it's reason to be) is in the charcuterie, and so it's those patés and boudins and terrines that should carry the most weight in judging the restaurant. It would be ideal if the restaurant did away with almost everything else and just let the menu do what it does best without hedging its bets that not everyone likes fatty pork molded into slabs. But that's just FitR's two cents, and you know how we like a good bit of molded pork.

POST:
 This week, Our Man chronicles the rise of Fujinese noodle joints in Chinatown—the earliest incarnations were out-and-out dives, but recent additions to the genre have amenities like actual waitresses. Our Man is at two such places this week, Food Sing 88 Corp. and Best Fuzhou Restaurant. At Food Sing 88 Corp., Our Man finds much to like. The house special hand-pulled noodles amount to a "a beef landslide in a rich fragrant broth." "If you want to eat like a Fujianese immigrant, pick the pork bone noodles," he continues. BUT! "Don’t order it unless you intend to suck down the copious marrow, which is the best part." Onward and upward to Best Fuzhou Restaurant, where Our Man finds enough organ meat and amphibians to occupy him, including duck kidney with cauliflower (yum!), frog wrapped with leaf (eh.) and do do frog’s leg (eh?). As an added bonus, at Best Fuzhou, Our Man "thrilled to the spectacle of two waitresses wrestling a five-foot eel." He also discovered a delicious-sounding dish that he says is a memorable new addition to the Lower East Side noodle catalog. To find out about that, though, you'll have to read Our Man's story... Food Sing 88 Corp. 2 East Broadway 212-219-8223 Best Fuzhou Restaurant 71A Eldridge Street 212-219-3328

Hand Pulled Noodle Devastation

POST:
Queens tipster Joey Deckle has sent us a few tidbits from deepest Queens (the most delicious borough). Quoth Joey: "The wonderful Flushing hand-pulled noodle with lamb soup joint referenced in this long Chowhound thread has been closed for at least a week. I asked the fellow at the hair stylist in the space across the way whether the proprietor planned on opening elsewhere and he said he doubted it because of the current economic climate. Simply devastating." "Not quite as devastating because it will almost certainly reopen, the wonderful Monya & Misha European Deli in Rego Park has been closed for renovations for what seems like a month. From peeking under the partially rolled down gate, it all most looks like they're doing a gut job on it. My fingers are crossed for them to reopen though since they haven't taken down the awning and since before they closed one of the guys who worked there said they'd be closed for renovations for a while."

Actually, marriage and love did not match very well together but then Renaissance literature developed the concepts of love and marriage and recorded the evolution of the relation between them. Even the sun turned up next day. For example, this young man caricatures the logic of gay marriage as leading to someone marrying their dog. I created it with a CTMH set and I believe I love that made more than the original:They do have a lot in common but both are pretty beautiful.And to Sandy and Paul: Happy Anniversary !!!(8yrs). Even with parental approval, many states will require court approval when a person is 16 years of age or less.

Beer for Lent

POST:
 We stopped by Beer Table, the new boutique-y beer place on 7th Avenue in Park Slope and had a glass of Schlenkerla Fastenbier, an ale made with smoked hops and which tastes exactly like barbecue. Really, it's like drinking a campfire—but in a pleasant way. Turns out this beer is made in Bamburg, Germany especially for Lent. It's only available from Ash Wednesday through Easter, and is designed to be hearty enough to fill you up while you're fasting (apparently, God is okay with a liquid lunch). The brewery's website says that this beer has "Brotzeit already included," meaning "afternoon snack" already included. Which is exactly how we like our beer.

 You should already know the answer to the world's most obnoxious question. ("Sparkling or still?") Tap. Thanks. This week, March 16-22, these restaurants will ask you to donate one dollar for the delicious NYC water you usually drink for free. Each dollar will provide clean drinking water to a child for 40 days—unsafe drinking water is currently the second leading cause of death in children under five worldwide. Go here for more info on the Tap Project, a UNICEF initiative.

 If you want to celebrate Saint Patrick's day with real live Irish people, skip the parade and head to Woodside, Queens, where you can eat and drink for a bargain, surrounded by unintelligible brogues. Go to the intersection of Woodside and Roosevelt Avenues, and pretty much any bar you stumble into is likely to pour a good Guinness. Some picks, after the jump. Today, The Starting Gate (59-10 Woodside Ave), a darkly cozy, no-nonsense sports bar is showing the All Ireland Club finals: St. Vincents versus the Nemo Rangers. (Those are football teams, for those of you who haven't been following St. Vincents and the Nemo Rangers all season long.) If I were you, I wouldn't cheer too loudly for one or the other until you figure out which team everyone else is rooting for. The clientele seems...serious about football.  Moving on! You're hungry. Go to Donovan's Pub (57-24 Roosevelt Ave), where you can get a really good Irish coffee, corned beef and cabbage (above, with a phallic-looking boiled potato) or one of the best, fattest burgers in town (below).  For dessert, stop by Woodside Candy (60-04 Woodside Ave), where the helpful Indian owner will point you to his selection of Irish candy (it's actually candy from the U.K., but you can't blame the guy for marketing to the neighborhood).   All the beer and heavy Irish food might leave you craving something spicy. This is Queens, after all, so a fantastic Asian market can't be too far away. H Mart (59-18 Woodside Ave) features entire aisles of kimchi, banchan, ready-to-eat bulgogi and other Korean deliciousness.

No Vodka for Veselka?

POST:
 No word yet on when the new Bowery branch of Veselka, the venerable Ukrainian soul food spot, will open, but when it does, you may not be able to toss back Ukrainian vodka with your borscht. Community Board 3 has denied a full liquor license to Veselka Bowery, on the grounds that there are eight other full, on-premise liquor licenses within 500 feet planned restaurant, and that the first location operates successfully with only a beer and wine license. The board concludes that the only justification for a full liquor license is the high rent. Ouch. Although the minutes from the community board meeting indicate that Veselka withdrew its application, a source at the restaurant said he believed the fight for a full bar is "going forward, through turbulence."

 According to the federal affidavit, former Governor Spitzer agreed to pay for any mini-bar charges during his tryst with Kristen at the Mayflower Hotel. Very generous of him! You know how outrageous those prices can be! But what might Kristen have chosen from the Mayflower's mini-bar? Turns out, there was plenty to choose from for a three diamond kind of girl: Gray Goose, Bombay Gin, Absolut Vodka, Chivas Regal, Johnny Walker Black, plus an assortment of soda, candy bars, cookies and peanuts. How many of those little bottles would it take before Spitzer started looking pretty good? Some questions we just can't answer.

 For FitR's first column, I'm visiting some of the oldest French restaurants in the city. The food might be good—Chez Napoleon and Tout va Bien—or it might leave much to be desired—Le Veau d'Or—but the real reason to visit these places is their stubbornly eccentric, time-warpish charm. Or to get hit on by Robert Treboux, above, who will surely oblige.

Our Man Sietsema Grapples with Mixology

POST:
 This week, Our Man heads to Williamsburg to explore the "crippled kitchen theme" at Huckleberry Bar. The trend, as Our Man sees it, is toward bars and lounges that bring on young, hungry chefs to create elaborate bar menus with little more than a hot plate. At Huckleberry, Our Man enjoys many of the small bites and sandwiches that emerge from the crippled kitchen—a toasted ham and cheese sandwich, showcasing ham from Salumeria Biellese and Irish cheddar, and the "perfect" pickle platter: "Veggies the size of a baby’s thumb march onto the plate in pairs, like a miniature Noah’s Ark: fennel bulbs, carrots, turnips, Bosc pears, yellow beets, and sliced Kirby cukes, each with its own lip-puckering astringency." Along the way, Our Man considers the absurdity of the term "mixologist" ("Why not 'alcohol chef?'") but approves of the end results, including classics like the Sidebar and Negroni, and new inventions like the Edward Bulwer-Lytton (ginger-infused rum, crème de coco and grapefruit juice). He also finds the bar's backyard to be the "perfect place to suck a spliff." Huckleberry Bar 588 Grand Street Williamsburg, Brooklyn 718-218-8555

 As of Tuesday, the Parks Department has awarded the Red Hook Ballfields vendors a six year permit. The official press release and details after the jump. Read the official press release here Obviously, this is very good news. But as for when we'll actually be able to get a pupusa in our hot little hands, that remains unclear. Bureaucracy in action: First the vendors have to sign the contract, then the city's law office has to sign off on it, then the controller's office has to register the contract. Then the Parks Department gives the green light. But wait, there's more. The vendors still have to work with the health department to get the relevant permits and equipment. Official word is that the parks departments "hopes" that the ballfield vendors will be up and running by the first day of the soccer league season.

 At the Union Square greenmarket last week, I met Andrew Coté, of Andrew's Local Honey. Andrew raises bees in Westchester and Fairfield counties, and he's a new addition to the greenmarket. His honey is delicious, especially the dark, almost bitter buckwheat variety, which is especially good on blue cheese. Andrew's double life, after the jump.  It turns out that for the past six years Andrew has traveled to Iraq, India, Nigeria and Guatemala to teach beekeeping, which provides otherwise impoverished people with honey, a cash crop. He's been doing it on his own dime, but now he's starting a non-profit called Bees without Borders to help fund his program in Cuba and the Ukraine. Stop by the Union Square greenmarket March 19th and April 2 to ask Andrew about the project, and to taste his honey.

 This week's Eats section is a special South Indian extravaganza. Our Man reviews Tamil Nadu Bhavan, a new vegetarian South Indian restaurant on Lexington Avenue. Meanwhile, I discover three Hindu temples that all boast canteens, two of which focus on South Indian fare. First up! Our Man at Tamil Nadu Bhavan, where he finds 20 varieties of dosas, including rarer finds like the ghee roast (a dosa swimming in clarified butter) and the self-explanatory "5-foot dosa," which is so big Our Man notes that it could be used to wrap up a good-sized child. Our Man also finds serviceable South Indian thalis (full set meals of rice, several veggies and bread), along with all manner of lentils and rice aplenty. The best rice option, Our Man finds, is a one called curd rice that comes swimming in yogurt. It has a "puckeringly sour effect. Little Miss Muffet would have approved," notes Our Man. Turn the page, and you'll find FitR (that's me) at three Hindu temples: two in Queens, one in New Jersey. Hindu temples often have kitchens to prepare prasad. Those are small food items (usually sweets) that are first offered to the gods, and then eaten by devotees as part of the worship. These three temple kitchens, though, evolved into full-fledged canteens. (Well, one is more of a sweets/snacks shop), You can sit among a hubbub of families and eat all kinds of dosas, uttapam, idli, daals and other, rarer, regional specialties like pongal—a buttery yellow split pea and whole peppercorn soup—and bobbatlu, a sweet, grainy flatbread served with milk poured over it.

The Early Word: Barrio, Moco Global Dining, Eurotrip
AUTHOR:
Sarah DiGregorio
DATE:
2008-04-29 10:48:00
POST:
 I've been to a couple new restaurants in the past week, and although they are too new to review, here's how they're looking so far: Barrio (210 7th Ave, Brooklyn 718-965-4000) The food here is mostly inoffensive—tasty at best, mediocre at worst, but all very, very overpriced. The place is charging prices that make you think it's aiming for something innovative, but in reality, Barrio is serving nominally fancied-up versions of dishes that you can get for about half the price and double the flavor at Tacos Nuevo Mexico, down on 5th Avenue. Just because you apply the sauce in a squeeze bottle squiggle does not mean you can jack up the prices. Plain chicken enchiladas for $14.25? Tortillas layered with chicken, onion, cilantro, radishes and queso fresco do not add up to anything too exciting. The shrimp in Yucatan shrimp were nicely grilled and flavored with cilantro and jalapeño, but the plate was mostly filled with fake-tasting coconut rice. For $17.25? Eeeesh. I'd usually not write about service issues at such a new restaurant, but our waitress here was...noteworthy. She asked my friend if she would like to "suck that last bit of alcohol out of the glass," recited the desserts to us while we were in the middle of our entrées, and at one point came right out and told us she had "forgotten all about us." The cocktails here are great, though. Snag a place out on the deck and have a Perfecto Nestorindo, a drink made with agave, tamarind, pineapple and chile powder. It's on the expensive side ($8) but sometimes you get what you pay for. Moco Global Dining, Eurotrip and better news, after the jump. Moco Global Dining (516A 3rd Avenue, 212-685-3663, 10016) This is a truly eccentric restaurant. Chef Joe Kurauchi trained in Japan and later worked at Spain’s El Bulli and the UK’s Fat Duck. Those globe trotting influences have produced a trippy, oddly compelling restaurant. The place looks like a cheesy, sushi-slinging happy hour joint and that’s partially true. But it’s actually much more interesting than that. There’s wonderful black tempura calamari, the airy batter rendered coal-black with squid ink. Nagoya-style chicken wings turn out to be tiny, inch-long quail wings in a sweet-spicy sauce. Madras noodle is a befuddling combo of udon noodles in a thick Japanese-style curry with a Parmesan crisp, fried soba noodles and a slice of grilled naan. It was bizarre, but strangely delicious. There's a sushi roll made with dried tomatoes, and the pan con tomate features garlic-tomato foam and chopped tomatoes on that pillowy soft, white Japanese sliced bread. And who could resist something called PuffyPuffyPuffy? That turns out to be an ice cream sundae on acid—layers of chocolate, green tea and vanilla ice cream with fruit and rice krispies, topped off with a few puffs of cotton candy. Eurotrip (667 5th Avenue Brookyn, 718-285-9425, 11215) The owners of this new Eastern European eatery have worked magic on the space, refurbishing the antique tin ceiling and brick walls, and creating a hospitable bar area in front, and a small dining room in back. The menu is heavy on the dumplings and stewed meat, and the bar is stocked with German and Czech beer, Hungarian wines and Becherovka, an herbal Czech liquor that shaken into several cocktails or sipped straight. Halušky, tiny dumplings tossed with tangy cheese, chives and bacon, have a comforting chew. Shredded celery root salad is aromatic with caraway and enriched with a tart buttermilk dressing. Gipsy wild turns out to be tender beef stew slicked with a paprika-heavy spicy sauce, and garnished with tiny-diced pickles. I wished there were more pickles to liven things up, but this seems to be developing into a place to get solidly good eastern European food in a friendly setting.

I live a block from that joint. It's on a commercial corner-of-death. Barrio won't last even as long as the overpriced sandwich joint that preceded it. And before that...I forget what. Ditto for Miracle Grill just across 3rd Street. They're both goin' down!! Only half-decent food in the Slope is on Fifth Ave.

Merkato 55 Deathwatched
AUTHOR:
Sarah DiGregorio

POST:
 Over at Eater, they've deathwatched Merkato 55, Marcus Samuelsson's newish, chi-chi, pan-African eatery in the meatpacking district. That doesn't necessarily mean that Merkato is on its way out, but the folks at Eater are rarely off the mark when they deathwatch a restaurant. A few weeks ago, I was working on a story revolving around the question: Will New Yorkers pay fancy French food prices for fancy African food? The subject didn't pan out as a long-form story, but it left me curious about how Merkato 55 would do. After all, with the exceptions of some North African cuisines (like Moroccan), African food is almost never interpreted in a New York fine dining setting. When I interviewed Samuelsson, he responded: “Opening a restaurant, any kind of restaurant, in New York City is expensive and challenging. And people often associate high-end restaurants with certain types of cuisine and not others.” He told me that he opened Merkato 55 with the intention of changing that notion that some cuisines are inherently high-end and others not. That's certainly a goal I can get behind. So if Merkato 55 fails, is it because we aren't willing to accept African food in a high-end setting? Actually I don't think so. I think the restaurant serves some really good food, but there are several serious problems with the way it was conceived that are working against it. For one thing, there's the meatpacking district itself. One one visit, I witnessed the following scene: A paunchy man in a blue oxford shirt was snuggled into a corner table with his younger blonde companion, who sported a black skirt slit up to her hip. He raised his eyebrows at the waiter, and said, “African-inspired? I’ve been to places in Africa where you don’t want to eat the food.” It's a short jump from that kind of attitude to bad jokes about Ethiopian food being composed of empty plates. But that's also the sort of crowd that frequents the meatpacking. Then, there's the fact that this is a tricky economic moment to open a 150-seat restaurant. And it's true that many of us simply don't know as much about African food (it is an entire continent...) as we do about other cuisines. To give a mildly embarrassing example, I thought that the foie gras chutney on Merkato 55’s menu was a contrivance for suckers (like me) who will order anything with foie gras in it. It never occurred to me that foie gras might be an ingredient actually eaten in Africa, until I was leafing through Marcus Samuelsson’s African cookbook, Soul of a New Cuisine, and came across the tidbit that foie gras originated in Egypt. The restaurant seems to be trying to split the difference between serious restaurant and clubby, trendy place in ways that are sometimes jarring. It offers injera bread (meant to be used as a utensil as well as a side dish) in a setting in which few feel comfortable eating with their hands, and serves absurdly expensive cocktails that are named after African tribal dances. (“We can’t call it an African cosmopolitan, so why not?” asked Samuelsson.) Samuelsson was at the restaurant both times I went to Merkato, but many have commented that he seems disconnected from the project. However, when I spoke with him on the phone, he seemed devoted to the restaurant. And Soul of a New Cuisine, is a fantastic cookbook, well-researched and passionate. But it may be that Samuelsson lost control of the concept to the other owners. Looking around Merkato, you have to wonder whom the repeat customers will be. If it’s the people who come for the flashing multi colored lights, those folks might not order, say, the tripe—one of the best items on the menu. A restaurant this large and ambitious has to fill seats to stay profitable. I'm curious what you think. Is Merkato flawed, or are New Yorkers not ready for a high-end African restaurant?

Food Writing with a Global Conscience
AUTHOR:

POST:
There's a really interesting story in this Sunday's Observer Food Monthly, (available online here). It's all about how refugees go about getting food and preparing it, and what dishes they long for from home. Food writing is often simply entertainment (useful for finding your next good meal, yes, but still entertainment). Sometimes it opens up into cultural and political issues, too, and then sometimes food writing can go to places that you might not imagine food writing could or should go, like into refugee camps. But why not? Even starving people have a food culture, and memories of foods from better times. If they've never experienced better times themselves, those memories are passed down from their parents or grandparents. This is the case for Palestinians, born into refugee camps, who talk about the traditional cooking of a home village that they've never themselves seen. The article reminded me of another amazing example of profoundly good food journalism, The Hungry Planet: What the World Eats, by Peter Menzel, Faith D'Aluisio. The authors asked families from countries around the world to gather all the food the eat in one week in front of them for a photograph. It ends up revealing alot more than exactly what they eat, it also gives you a tangible notion of how they live.

Fork in the Road Reviews Islero (Plus Bonus Recipe)

POST:
 In this week's paper, I review Islero, a new tapas spot on East 50th Street. The upshot is that Islero has potential, but it doesn't seem to know itself very well. Throughout a meal at Islero, there are some inexplicable choices that seem to be an awkward reach for trendiness or fanciness—too many fussy garnishes, squeeze-bottle squiggles of sauce, chairs that tower strangely over the tables. But some of the food is really tasty, and if the place would just relax into itself, I think it would be a good neighborhood spot. The recipe (it's simple this week!) for Islero's best dish, arroz cremoso, after the jump. Islero's Arroz Cremoso Yield: 4 Servings 4 ounces forbidden Chinese black rice (see note) 1 tablespoon olive oil 6 cups hot chicken stock 1/2 cup creme fraiche 1 tablespoon white truffle oil 2 ounces drunken goat cheese, cut in cubes 3 ounces Manchego cheese, shredded In a pot over medium heat, combine rice and olive oil, and stir until all grains are coated and shiny. As if you were making risotto, add the chicken stock in 1/2 cup increments, stirring after each addition until chicken stock is absorbed by the rice. Once all the chicken stock has been absorbed by the rice, remove from heat and stir in the creme fraiche and truffle oil. Serve into 4 bowls, top each with an equal amount of the goat cheese cubes and shredded Manchego cheese. Serve immediately. Note: Forbidden Chinese black rice can be found at Kalustyans.

Our Man Sietsema at the Golden Shopping Mall

POST:
 When J &L Shopping Mall in Flushing went under (reportedly because the owner sold it to a condo developer) a cry of hungry despair went up from chowhounders everywhere. J&L had held a much-loved food court with obscure regional Chinese specialties. But take heart, Our Man Sietsema is here to save the day. This week, Our Man is at Flushing's Golden Shopping Mall, a worthy substitute for J&L. Our Man notes that the food court here holds "an even more arcane assortment of Chinese regional cooking styles." Our Man throughly enjoys himself at the food court. He finds all sorts of regional dishes, like Sichuan composed meat salads swimming in chile oil, and the lighter fare from Tianjin, such as a salad of bean curd, celery and boiled peanuts. He finds hand-cut noodles from Xi'an, and recommends the lamb noodle. And as is his wont, Our Man loves the lamb sandwich—"Don't miss the so-called lamb burger ($2.50), a wonderful sandwich on a homemade pita layered with rich roasted meat and pickled chilies." (If Our Man was coming to my house for dinner, I'd definitely make lamb.) A classic Our Man column, a great find. Get there.

YourAsian Crashes and Burns

POST:
 I went by YourAsian for lunch today, the new place opened by Jerry Joseph, lately of Jerry's in SoHo, thinking I'd put it in the dining guide. First of all, the sign is terrifying. Second of all, the food is such an unmitigated disaster that I can't justify wasting the newsprint for a dining guide blurb. The waste of a perfectly good mealtime, sadly, can't be undone. This is a case of a decent concept that's badly executed. Basically, the place is meant to be like a salad bar with Asian noodles. You know, like PAX (not very good either, but you get the idea)—you tell the guy behind the counter what toppings and dressing you want, they toss it together, end of story. At YourAsian, first you choose a base from among a number of different Asian noodles and rice: soba noodles, jasmine rice, nasi goreng (Indonesian fried rice), Thai noodles, fried rice noodles, and so on. Then you select your topping—stir fried chicken or beef, shredded pork, bbq roast pork, among others. Finally, you choose a sauce, which ranges from spicy red curry to sweet and sour or teriyaki. You can also get those selections in a bowl of soup, rather than in a sauce, with either miso or chicken broth. I liked the conceit of YourAsian, but I wasn't expecting miracles. Just some fairly good noodles and tasty toppings—a good fast food option for the neighborhood. I mean, Asian street vendors make amazing versions of this stuff with hardly any equipment at all, so you'd think that a restaurant with skilled workers (the chef is formerly of Yumcha) and basic amenities could whip up an adequate pile of noodles. No. First of all, when you choose your noodles or rice, the counter person grabs a cold plastic container filled with your selection. Then, they throw your choice of meat on top (there are no veggies). They glop on the sauce, and proceed to stick the plastic container in the microwave. So what you get is a plastic container, the lid dripping condensation. The pile of noodles or rice is stone cold in the middle and searingly hot on the edges. The noodles themselves are mushy and overcooked and the sauce is heavy and manages to have almost no flavor. The only nice thing I can say is that the summer rolls are decent. Maybe they'll get their act together, but I think that their microwaving system is flawed—I'd rather eat something that has been sitting in a steam table than have it zapped into gummy, hot-cold oblivion. After a few bites, I fled down the block to BonBon Chicken. Now that shit is good.

I have to say I agree to a degree. They have to iron out the kinks with with the heating. But as far as the food is concern; I disagree. I have been at YourAsian every day for 3 days now and my food has been delicious and full of flavor the service is so friendly and the place is immaculate.

Test Tube Meat Update: PETA 'Civil War' 
AUTHOR:

POST:
In-vitro meat has gotten a lot of attention in the last few weeks, after a recent international symposium on the subject. PETA has now jumped in on the test tube meat action. From the group's website: "PETA is offering a $1 million prize to the contest participant able to make the first in vitro chicken meat and sell it to the public by June 30, 2012. The contestant must do both of the following: • Produce an in vitro chicken-meat product that has a taste and texture indistinguishable from real chicken flesh to non-meat-eaters and meat-eaters alike. • Manufacture the approved product in large enough quantities to be sold commercially, and successfully sell it at a competitive price in at least 10 states." The New York Times, reporting on the story, quotes PETA founder, Ingrid Newkirk, as saying that the decision to sponsor the prize led to "'a near civil war in our office,' since so many PETA members are repulsed by the thought of eating animal tissue, even if no animals are killed."

PETA is the worst of the AR rights groups in my opinion, They began well, But something went wrong somewhere. Something is just not right sounding about test tube meat. What chems are they going to try to infect us with? Where did they get the million bucks from to entice this lunacy? oh yeah, from good people like you and me that gave our hard earned monies to help animals. A million dollars could have created a free or afordable S & N program? What else do they spend their tax exempt money on? oh yeah They had to settle with show dog people for their crazed people going to a dog show and releasing show dogs from their cages, which was right by a freeway and many were killed. They spend our donated monies on getting their people out of jail when they break the law. PETA needs to lose their tax exempt status and fast. and we good americans need to investigate organizations prior to donating money to them. Money is power, Peta has money. They lobby to take away our rights to have a family pet???? If we do not stand united against them NOW one by one we will lose our rights. Dont be a sucker and allow them to spoon fed you BS.

Calorie Counting in Times Square
AUTHOR:
Sarah DiGregorio
DATE:
2008-04-21 12:19:00
POST:
 The law that will force New York restaurants with more than 15 branches nationwide to post calories on menus was to go into effect today, but it has been delayed. The Department of Health says that the district court judge has now set Friday the 25th as the new date for the law to go into effect, and pushed the date for issuing fines back to June 6. This is to allow time for legal maneuvering on the part of the NY Restaurant Association, which is now going to the Second Circuit appeals court to seek a stay of the law. The court will likely decide on whether or not to grant a stay today. Because the status of the law seems to change every time we turn around, there's a lot of confusion out there about when restaurants will need to comply. I went to Times Square, the epicenter of chain restaurant-dom, where the calorie law will make the biggest splash, to see how it was going down. Terrifying ribs from TGI Friday's after the jump.  At TGI Friday's, the new menus that list calories are already in use. And it is terrifying. Those would have to be some mighty fine ribs to make them worth 1910 calories. Salads range from about 900 to 1300, and innocuous-sounding choices like a grilled chicken sandwich weighs in at 1360. The sirloin steak, on the other hand, has only 290. Calorie counts have gotten enough publicity lately that those numbers may not be such a shock, but seeing them there on the menu is probably enough to give anyone pause. I'm generally against banning certain foods (like foie gras) but you can't really argue with the value of more information. If you think those ribs are worth nearly 2,000 calories, you are welcome to order them. At Starbucks, the calories went up on the menu boards last week. So, we discover that the blended creme green tea is 650 calories, and the large iced cafe mocha is 400. Surprisingly, most customers I talked to hadn't noticed the change—maybe because most people go in knowing what they want, and don't look at the menu. But Joan Wilson, who works nearby at MTV, told me that she switched from whole to skim milk for her daily large cinnamon dolce latte. The whole milk version was 400 calories, while the one with skim milk is 160 calories. "I hate skim milk," Joan said. "But with the calorie difference, it's not even a question." None of the other chains in Times Square had instituted the calorie listings yet. The managers at Sbarro and McDonald's hadn't even heard of the law. At the Olive Garden, the manager said that he was waiting for word from above. "This is a corporate-type situation," he said. "I think people are going to eat what they're going to eat, good or bad." At Bubba Gump's Shrimp, maitre d's Carlos Gonzales and Gio Sykes were happy to give me their thoughts on the matter ("I don't know if this is such a good thing for restaurants, but you know, at the end of the day, people are going to eat what they want to eat.") until they were cut off by Aaron Vazquez, the manager, who told me brightly that everyone at Bubba Gump is "very excited about it."

Thanks for brining up this issue! It's great some restaurants are participating, but there are still a lot hiding info. It’s amazing how hard restaurant chains are fighting to hide their nutrition information. I wanted to share a new service my company just launched called ‘Wellternatives’ that lets people find nutrition info for thousands of chain restaurants for free – right from their cell phone or on the web. It also makes recommendations for a healthier alternative, hence the name… Wellternatives. If restaurants aren’t going to post their nutrition info, we figured we’d do what we could to give people instant access to the info from anywhere. Would love to hear what you think of it! Maija

Mamoun's Hot Sauce To Go

 I was grabbing a falafel sandwich from Mamoun's the other day, and noticed that their hot sauce is bottled and available for sale for $3. The sauce is brick red with paprika, black peppery and medium-hot. I poured it all over my sandwich, but it would also be fantastic for homecooking, as an addition to spicy lamb stew or a chicken tagine.

Best Foie Gras Ever Plus Good Karma?
AUTHOR:
Sarah DiGregorio
DATE:
2008-04-18 10:25:00
POST:
 Via Michael Ruhlman's blog, I discovered this article in Lancaster Farming about Chef Dan Barber's trip to visit Spanish farmer Eduardo Sousa, during which Barber says he sampled the best foie gras he had ever tasted. The big news here is not that Barber had a tasty trip, but that Sousa produces foie gras without force feeding his geese. He just supplies them with as many figs, acorns, nuts and olives as their little, gluttonous hearts desire, stands back, and lets them gorge themselves. Voila—engorged fatty goose liver. And it's not just Barber's opinion that this is great foie gras. It turns out that last year, Sousa won the Coup de Coeur award for the best foie gras from the Paris International Food Salon. Sousa says that his job is to keep the geese happy. Lancaster Farming reports: "Several times, Barber noted, while he was speaking to Sousa he was asked to keep his voice down 'so as not to upset the geese.'" The idea is that happy geese equal outrageously delicious foie gras. In fact, Barber said that eating it was the best culinary experience of his life. But sadly, it won't be on the menu at Blue Hill anytime soon. Sousa, who sounds like a bit of a nut job, won't sell it to Barber, saying that "chefs don’t deserve this." Personally, I don't think that traditionally produced foie gras is any crueler than eating meat in general. If you can eat meat without dueling with your conscience, you probably shouldn't be agonizing over foie gras. In fact, because foie gras producers are often small, family-run farms, they tend to have more humane, natural conditions than the factory farms that produce the supermarket meats that so many of us buy and eat without a thought. Sticking a tube down a bird's throat sounds terrible, mostly because we humans are imagining the same done to us. But we have a gag reflex, whereas it's been reported (here and here) that ducks and geese don't have that gag reflex, and in fact are evolutionarily designed to be able to gorge and carry fat stores in their livers in preparation for migration. But, hey, if it can be produced without force feeding, all the better. More foie gras for all.

Kudos to you mentioning the reality of the foie gras business being predominantly family owned. I completely agree that, despite the uproar over this practice, analogies shouldn't be made to human physiology to argue animal cruelty. Foie gras is a moral issue. It isn't and shouldn't be considered an ethical issue.

 I was bouncing back and forth between the Yankees-Red Sox game and Top Chef last night (Which was more excruciating? It's a toss up.) This is because I live in the stone age and do not yet have DVR. But it seemed like every time I flipped back to Top Chef, some cheftestant or other was tossing around the phrase "the masses." As in: "I don't cook for the masses," or "Since we're cooking for the masses..." I'm sorry, did you go to the Barack Obama Charm and Diplomacy School? Yes, the great unwashed could never wrap their minds around your grilled pear or your desiccated bread salad. Does anyone else get a nasty little jolt when you hear that phrase? Anyway! I'm glad hobbit Mark didn't get booted. He's one of the only contestants who seems like a person you'd actually want to hang out with. Although not in a bubble bath, thanks.

Fork in the Road Reviews Elettaria (with Bonus Recipe)
AUTHOR:
Sarah DiGregorio
DATE:

POST:
 This week, I review Elettaria, Akhtar Nawab's new Indian-New American place on 8th Street in the Village. I think the only other critic to write about Elettaria so far is Alan Richman, and I agree with his assessment that the restaurant has "a coherent and confident point of view." Much of what I ate at Elettaria was both delicious and surprising—new ideas thoughtfully executed. Even when things aren't quite right (check out the waitress' dresses, for one...) they do reflect coherence and confidence. This is a restaurant with a soul and a point of view. Whenever I review a restaurant, I'm going to try to get the chef to give me the recipe for a dish I liked and post it here. So! Akhtar Nawab's Pan roasted Duck, Keema, Nettles, Cardamom, after the jump. Pan roasted Duck, Keema, Nettles, Cardamom Chef Akhtar Nawab, Elettaria Yield: serves 4 1 Long Island duckling, butchered into two legs and two breasts 1 cup sugar 1 cup salt 1 tsp coriander, toasted 1 tsp fennel seed , toasted 1 tsp mustard seed, toasted 4 sprigs thyme 2 bay leaves 1 tsp peppercorns 4 cardomom pods, ground in a spice grinder and toasted 4 tbs butter, divided 1 onion, minced fine 2 tsp ginger, minced 4 garlic cloves, minced 1 fresh chile 2 cinnamon sticks 2 cloves 4 cardamom pods, divided 1 tsp turmeric 1 tsp saffron 2 large potatoes, peeled and diced, 1/2 inch squares 1/4 cup golden raisins 1/4 cup diced carrots, 1/2 inch squares 1lb stinging nettles, cleaned and blanched ground cardamom, to taste For the duck breasts: In a large bowl, combine the sugar, salt, coriander, fennel, mustard seeds, thyme, bay leaves, peppercorns, and cardamom. Pour this curing mixture over the duck breasts and leave to cure for 8 hours. Bone the leg meat and coarsely dice the meat. Place in the freezer for 1 hour. When fully frozen, run through a meat grinder and place the ground leg meat in the fridge to keep cold. For the keema (ragout): In a large pot, add 2 tbs butter, then add the onion, ginger, garlic and chile. Leave to stew until tender. Separately, toast the cinnamon, cloves, 2 cardamom pods, turmeric and saffron in a small pan over medium heat. When aromatic, add the toasted spices to the onion mixture. In a separate pan, heat 1 tbs butter and add the ground duck leg meat. Cook until the fat separates from the meat. Pour into a colander and discard the fat. Add the ground duck meat to the already cooking onion and spice mixture. Cook over low heat until the flavor begins to develop. After an hour of low heat cooking, add the carrots and cook for 20 more minutes. Then add the potatoes and cook until tender. When the potatoes are tender the ragout can be removed from the stove and left to cool. To finish the dish: Cook the duck breasts on the skin side on low heat in a heavy steel pan to render the fat. After about 10 minutes, discard the fat and add 1 tbs of butter to the pan. Add 2 cardamom pods to the pan, and baste until the meat is medium rare. Leave to rest in a warm place. In the same pan as the duck was cooking, add the blanched nettles and sauté. Gently re-heat the ragout in a small pot. Equally divide the ragout into 4 bowls, being careful not to damage the cooked potatoes. Carve and place the slices of duck breast over the ragout. Scatter the stinging nettles over the duck and season with ground cardamom.

Hi Howlie, You are probably right about the duck recipe. Thank goodness for chefs who do all that shit for us. But I think it's fun to see how it's made. To answer your question: the waitresses wear green silk, jester-like sack dresses, with billowy trumpet sleeves and strange little pom poms. They're not generic, that's for sure. -Sarah

POST:
 This week, Our Man is at Agnanti, a new restaurant in Bay Ridge that specializes in the cooking of the expat Greek community in Turkey. The background info in this story is classic Our Man—he tells us all the Greeks in Turkey: their history, their cooking and even digs up "Apicius, the Roman Mark Bittman" to comment on a soup. If you got all your history lessons from Our Man's columns, you'd be doing pretty well. On to the food! Our Man likes it. He especially likes the rooster: "Who'd believe that a tough old cock would cook up so juicy and flavorful?" Ba dum bum. He also loves the vegetarian stuffed grape leaves, the croquettes of zucchini and cheese and soutzoukakia, ground meat kabobs in tomato sauce flavored with an unexpected jolt of cumin. A few items get the smackdown. Our Man notes that the kitchen gets a little overzealous with its grill, rendering its grilled meats dry—"a fate that also befalls sardines and pork chops..." Sigar bourek, sometimes called "fingers of Fatimah...bear an unmistakable resemblance to frozen croissants." Oh snap. But Our Man finds plenty to like, including the cheese selection. What's in Pandora's feta? You'll have to read the story to find out.

Tax Day Special: Cheapest Meal Possible

POST:
 Today is tax day, so in honor of feeling poor and our sad, sad economy, I decided to see exactly how cheaply I could make a meal that actually tastes good and is also nutritious. Store-brand mac and cheese (probably the actual cheapest meal available) is out, since it is neither tasty nor nutritious. At my local Associated grocery store, I bought: 2 pounds baking potatoes: $1 (on sale) thyme: $1 1 head garlic: .40 2 large onions: 1.04 1 pound dried cannellini beans .89 Total: $4.33 With these ingredients (plus salt, pepper and oil), I came up with a low-rent, more filling version of pommes anna, the buttery, crispy sliced potato cake from France. Each serving of this dish costs about 1.10. If you're feeling flush, you could add layers of bacon or cheese. Potato Cake with Caramelized Onions and Cannellini Beans: Recipe after the jump! Potato Cake with Caramelized Onions and Cannellini Beans Yield: about 4 servings 1/2 pound dried cannellini beans 8 springs thyme, divided 5 tablespoons oil, divided 2 large onions, sliced 6 cloves garlic, sliced salt and pepper 8 medium baking potatoes (about 2 1/2 pounds), sliced thin Put the beans in a pot with 4 cups warm water and 2 thyme sprigs. Bring to a boil, cover pot, remove from heat and set aside to soak for 2 hours. Meanwhile, caramelize the onions: In a saute pan, warm 1 tablespoon of oil over medium heat. Add the onions and garlic, season with salt and pepper, and cook, stirring, until onions are limp. Turn heat to low, and let onions cook, stirring occasionally, until golden brown and caramelized, about 45 minutes. Chop the remaining thyme and stir it into the onions. Preheat oven to 425 degrees. Drain the beans and add them to the caramelized onion mixture. Remove from heat. Spread 1 tablespoon of oil in the bottom of an oven-proof, straight-sided saute pan. Line the bottom of the pan with potato slices, in an overlapping pattern to create an even layer. Season potato layer with salt and pepper, and drizzle 1 tablespoon oil over. Take half the onion-bean mixture, and spread it over the potatoes. Arrange a second layer of potatoes over the onion-bean layer, season it with salt and pepper and drizzle it with 1 tablespoon oil. Spread the remaining onion-bean mixture on top in an even layer. Arrange a last layer of potatoes on top, and season with salt and pepper. Lightly oil a piece of foil with the remaining oil, and place the foil oil-side down on top of the potato cake. Press down gently. Bake for 30 minutes, remove foil and bake for an additional 30 minutes. Let cool for about 10 minutes, then run a knife along the edges of the pan, and invert it over a plate. Tap on the top of the pan. It should come out like a cake, but if it doesn't hold together, it's just as delicious in a pile.

Test Tube Meat?
AUTHOR:
Sarah DiGregorio
DATE:
2008-04-15 13:36:00
POST:
 The first in-vitro meat symposium was held last week in Norway. Yes, in-vitro meat, as in meat grown in a lab, from cell culture. That sounds pretty gross, but it's actually no more disgusting (and infinitely more humane) than many factory-farming practices. Jason G. Matheny, of New Harvest, just got back from the symposium, and he agreed to answer all our burning questions about test tube meat. "It should taste the same as regular ground meat..." after the jump. How does growing meat in-vitro work? Cultured meat is meat produced in vitro, in a cell culture, rather than from an animal. The production of cultured meat begins by taking a number of cells from a farm animal and proliferating them in a nutrient-rich medium. Cells are capable of multiplying so many times in culture that, in theory, a single cell could be used to produce enough meat to feed the global population for a year. After the cells are multiplied, they are attached to a sponge-like "scaffold" and soaked with nutrients. They may also be mechanically stretched to increase their size and protein content. The resulting cells can then be harvested, seasoned, cooked, and consumed as a boneless, processed meat, such as sausage, hamburger, or chicken nuggets. How did the symposium go? Did you learn about anything new? The meeting was very encouraging. The general consensus is that a ground meat product like sausage or hamburger is both technically and economically feasible in the near-term. What were the big issues at the symposium this year? One of the big challenges has been development of animal-free culture media and growth factors. There's been excellent research in this area recently, and it looks like this challenge can be solved in the near-term. Another issue at the symposium was economics. The consortium funded an independent economic assessment, which found that by adapting existing technologies, it should be possible to make a cultured meat product that's competitive with conventional meat. I notice that many of your colleagues at the in-vitro meat association are European. Is Europe ahead of the US on this? Yes, definitely. The Dutch government has shown unique foresight by funding research on cultured meat. It would be good for the US government to catch up. After all, in this country we've got more heart attacks, more water pollution, and more greenhouse gas emissions due to meat. When will the technology be ready to produce in-vitro meat on a large scale? Our guess is 5 to 10 years. This could likely be shortened by more energetic investment in research and development. Why should we support in-vitro meat production? Cultured meat could help solve a lot of global problems. Fatty meats are thought to cause two million deaths each year. With cultured meat, you could have a hamburger that has the fat profile of an avocado. Meat production is responsible for more greenhouse gases than the transportation sector. With cultured meat, you could reduce emissions to a fraction of what they are now. And with cultured meat, you wouldn't have problems like avian flu, Mad Cow, or the salmonella or campylobacter that contaminate our meat. Lastly, with cultured meat you wouldn't need to raise and kill 50 billion farm animals each year. The most common objection I've heard to cultured meat is that it's unnatural. This is true, but it's also unnatural to raise tens of thousands of animals under a tin roof, doping them with antibiotics and growth promoters. That's what we do now. We can do much better. We already accept bioengineered products like yogurt, so I'm optimistic that consumers will accept cultured meat, particularly given its health benefits. How does it taste? It should taste the same as regular ground meat, as it's made of essentially the same material. In theory, would you be able to grow anything from a porterhouse steak to a pork shoulder? Growing whole pieces of meat, like steaks or drumsticks, is a much more difficult challenge. My guess is that's decades off. But half the meat we eat is ground meat, so we should start there. Will you run into trouble with the American Cattlemen Association or other lobbying groups? I haven't seen any statements from the livestock industry groups about this. Meat processors like Tyson should be in favor of any technology that helps their bottom line. In principle cultured meat could eventually be cheaper than traditional meat, since you can avoid losses due to animal disease, and integrate meat production from start to finish under one roof. But it's true that cultured meat would compete with large livestock producers. How did you get interested in in-vitro meat? I was working in India on a public health project and was surprised to see a trend toward the factory farming practices and meat consumption common in the U.S. It was clear that the problems we have with American meat production and consumption—pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, heart disease, food contamination, and poor animal welfare—are becoming global. Around the same time I had read about NASA research on cultured meat— meat produced in a cell culture rather than in an animal—to feed astronauts. It seemed like the technology would have more important applications feeding people on Earth.

I did a paper on this for my english class and I thought it was an excellent idea. If we figure a way to create cheaper meat that can save the lives of hundreds of thousands of cows a year. Pollution from livestock attributes to around 18% of total pollution a year. That alone is reason enough to find a way to create meat another way. If the product was just as tasty and had no unhealthy side effects than why not give it a try!!

Well "BadKarma," the world's largest group of nutritional scientists & consultants, the American Dietetic Assoc., contradicts your claims that veganism is not "nutritious" and causes "anemia" (www.dietitians.ca/news/downloads/vegetarian_position_paper_2003.pdf, which compiles more than 250 other peer-reviewed studies) and you'll find that vegetarians have less osteoporosis than the average American meat-eater, and vegans are about the same. Kids raised vegan even have an average 19 extra points of I.Q. (JADA 1980; 76:142-7). Vegans and other vegetarians both live longer than the average American (Key TH, Thorogood M, Appleby PM, Burr ML. Dietary habits and mortality in 11,000 vegetarian and health conscious people: results of a 17-year follow up. BMJ. 1996;313:775-779). Vegans also suffer less from even NON-fatal maladies while alive, such as Alzheimer’s, IMPOTENCE :-) (the arteries in the penis as a network of many small-diameter ones, just like the coronaries), constipation, diabetes, and vegans have stronger immune systems overall (as my 1st link shows). Also, most vegans I know support the "cell cultured meat" instead of trying to "derail" it as you suggest. So to summarize, "BadKarma," take your disinformation which contradicts REAL nutritional science, and shove it up your polyp-covered large intestine. Go join GW Bush if you want to use false, anti-scientific propaganda.

If this becomes SOP for boneless meat products, what tactics do you suppose the Veganist Jihad will use to try and derail it, since their actual agenda has nothing whatsoever to do with "animal rights", and everything to do with eliminating human rights and terrorizing/legislatively forcing the entire planet to eat their non-nutritious, unhealthful, anemia-and-osteoporosis-causing, cow-fodder diet?

This is horrific! Think of the deaths with genetically altered corn that got into the human food chain. (the very corn we are feeding to cows) We are what we eat. We should not play God with nature. The reason beef has become harmful is because we feed cows grain instead of grass - they are not designed to eat grain. With grass fed beef the fats created are omega 3. With grain fed beef 50% of the fat is saturated.

 'S Baggers, a restaurant in Nuremburg, Germany, is completely automated, making it possible for you to go to dinner without speaking to a single human. First, order off a touch screen (the menu is heavy on the meat, and includes a "slaughterhouse meat platter" ) and later, your meal comes sliding down a spiral track system to your table. Their motto: " All good things come from above" You can even set up direct debit for your meals, and pay just once at the end of the month. Hasn't Battlestar Galactica taught these people anything? The system could evolve and multiply and start force-feeding us sausage. Other Europeans are finding this very amusing. A commenter on the Guardian food blog: "The reason this works is that you can only order three things to eat in Germany, and two of them are sausages." The BBC is just glad the system means they don't have to tip.

 Gentrification has definitely come to the stretch of 5th Avenue between 17th Street and 24th Street in south Park Slope. Where there was once pretty much just a discount store, a great Polish restaurant and deli, a good, old-school pizza place and a decent Ecuadorian restaurant, we now have a mediocre sushi place, a wine bar, a wine shop, a classic cocktails bar and soon a "southwestern American tapas" place. Gentrification is going to happen one way or another, but I always cross my fingers that it will bring more good food than bad, and that it won't leave the neighborhood looking like a bistro-tapas theme park. When I saw the signage and plywood go up for Eurotrip I worried it might turn out to be a yuppified bistro serving overpriced paninis. But cheer up! In fact, Eurotrip will offer casual Central European fare, conceived by Maria Zizak, a chef from the Czech Republic. There's a nice selection of Czech and German beers on tap, as well as Hungarian and German wines. The menu runs from Viennese duck to Czech bread dumplings and pork to "Euro Tripe"—homemade tripe soup. And although the place is clearly "nicer" than many of the restaurants surrounding it, it's in sync with the flavor of the neighborhood, which used to be (and to some extent still is) central and eastern European. Eurotrip opens next week. 667 5th Avenue, Brooklyn 718.285.9425

 This week, FitR's column explores the urban winemaking phenomenon. The idea of making wine commercially in a city is all over SF's Bay Area already—see SF Chronicle, Imbibe magazine. And now it's come to New York. Urban winemaking isn't about growing grapes in the city, which would be pretty much impossible. But there's a growing group of winemakers who want to have their production and tasting room facilities within the five boroughs—which makes sense, since a younger, more urban population is drinking more wine than ever before. That's Michael Dorf, above, the founder of the Knitting Factory, who is opening a giant custom-crush facility in the West Village this fall. Basically, that means you can pay to make a barrel of your own wine under the tutelage of an expert winemaker. Other urban wine activities: Bridge Winery's tasting room in Williamsburg, where you can taste at the bar as well as buy bottles, and Vintage New York's tasting room, where you can taste and buy Brooklyn Oenology's first two wines, just released this winter. Today, Dr. Vino has news of yet another new urban winery, this one set to open in Red Hook.

 This week, Our Man checks out Soba Totto, the newest addition to the Yakitori Totto chain. Soba Totto focuses on charcoal-grilled skewers of chicken. We didn't realize chicken sternum could be skewered, but Our Man is here to teach us these things. And he likes it: "an aerodynamic-looking bone that's ganged up three to a stick like jet planes flying in formation, producing a soft crunch as you bite down." Our Man also notes that at dinner on Valentine's Day he found the skewered chicken hearts irresistible, as they looked exactly like mini human hearts. He's a romantic, after all. Among the more familiar chicken parts, Our Man says that the chicken skin and the chicken meatballs are the "awesomest." Also recommended are the many versions of soba noodles, and a "lovely invalid's rice porridge." All in all, Our Man really likes this restaurant, so we suggest you get there now. But avoid the sea cucumber. If Our Man admits he finds a food repulsive and frightening, we're pretty sure one bite would give the general public nightmares for life.

Author Michael Ruhlman wants to know what you think are the emerging food trends in the US. Apparently, Ruhlman has been asked by a "prominent food magazine" to come up with predictions for the next big thing. He opened up the question to comments on his blog, and responses range from interesting ("better control over temperature for the home cook") to the, um, upsetting ( "cooking with urine...I think it might work with french fries") As always, the internets brings out the crazies. Thoughts? Share them here. (On an unrelated note, No Reservations Las Vegas was on last night, in which Ruhlman and Bourdain go on an eating and drinking orgy all over the city. And all I could think was: Why, why, must Ruhlman wear his sunglasses indoors? That's only okay if you're blind.)

 I was looking through the list of events for Brooklyn's Cherry Blossom Festival (May 3-4), when I came across an event called "Sleeping with the Fishes," a sushi pillow photo op. So yes, it turns out that not only will there be a photo op with sushi pillows, but also this photo op with sushi pillows will be five hours long.  The pillows come in either nigiri or roll varieties, and you can also get extras like a soy sauce packet pillowcase. Their website, here. Overpriced and silly, yes, but smitten, totally smitten.

 After 12 long years of inglorious defeat to the Japanese and Americans in the Coupe du Monde de la Boulangerie (the World Cup of Baking), the French have finally recaptured the gold medal. The competition is judged on three items: a baguette, a yeast pastry and a showpiece that's not meant to be eaten. The French entry in the last category was a voluptuous bread woman in haute couture, naturally. The Wall Street Journal has covered it here and here.

Love the Lovely Ramen

POST:
 Rainy, chilly days are made for ramen, so for lunch I finally made it over to Hakata Ippudo, the newest contender for the East Village ramen crown. While Setagaya, a fellow Japanese import, is known for its salt-based broth, Ippudo traffics in tonkotsu, a long-simmered pork broth. I got the basic bowl, the Shiromaru ramen original recipe ($13). This is a serious, substantial broth. It's the color of milky tea, and it tastes deeply of pork. The ramen is thin, like angel hair, and delicately wheaty. It's topped with slices of stewed pork, green cabbage, a tangle of black mushrooms and scallions. It's a contender, that's for sure. But what's up with the pickles? I can never stop myself from getting the pickles at Momofuku—they are just so freaking good, always. And since Momofuku and Ippudo are totally different spins on the ramen joint, it's really not fair to compare their pickles. But! I ordered Ippudo's "special chef's pickes" and received a bowl full of seasoned rice vinegar with a few batons of daikon, carrot, bell pepper, cucumber and a lemon slice floating in it. It was pleasant-tasting enough, but nothing I couldn't have quick-pickled myself at home. And for seven dollars, it was pretty much a disgrace. Also, the waitstaff are a little over excited for my taste. One waiter came over to ask me if everything was alright before I had gotten any food—which made me wonder if he was asking if I was okay in general. Then, when the waitress brought my check, she literally kneeled down at my feet and went over the bill with me, which I found alarming. Do they always do that? But really, this place is all about the ramen, and it's so good that everything else fades away. And Ippudo is bigger than the other ramen spots in the neighborhood, which means shorter wait times and more ramen for all. Hakata Ippudo 64 4th Ave 212-388-0088

For us Japanese, this is the real ramen. I'm happy that now New Yorkers can taste the real Japanese ramen, unlike the fake stuff that Momofuku serves. Momofuku's noodle is not ramen. Its a total disgrace.

i thought momofuko's ramen special was the richest, most indulgent and most expensive ramen i've had ever! i actually love it as an extraordinary dish- despite it not being authentic japanese- in so many ways... however, ippudu's ramens are excellent and seem a close second. warning: both places are LOUD, and if pumping music negatively affects your taste buds' functioning, dont stay around longer than necessary to slurp down your ramens...

Endless Summer: Cheap Mexican in WBurg That's Actually Good
AUTHOR:

POST:
Today, guest blogger Araceli Cruz, an editor here at VV, tells you all about Endless Summer, a taco truck near her apartment in Williamsburg. Araceli happens to be from LA, land of taco trucks, so she knows of which she speaks. Take it away: As a native of California, I’ve inhaled as much Mexican food as smog, but in New York it’s a different story, especially in my neighborhood––Williamsburg. Mexican food is scarce, at least in the vicinity between Metropolitan and North 12h Street. Aside from their cheap margaritas, San Loco is an utter disappointment. Vera Cruz, which sits on Bedford Avenue, was actually really good, especially their chicken flautas and cheese enchiladas, but after they recently reopened, the flavors are dull. Though recently, there’s no denying the carne asada aroma that’s been coming from the corner of North Sixth and Bedford. The enticing scent leads to Endless Summer, a taco truck owned by two dudes (seriously they’re dudes) named Jeff and Curtis. The joint venture is almost a year old, though has only been making waves on Bedford Avenue for a couple of months. I finally got to experience Endless Summer and was extremely surprised. My friends and I ordered a pork taco ($2.50), a chicken burrito ($5), a Mexican corn ($2.50), and a side of beans and rice ($2.50). They also sell vegetarian tacos and burritos. The first thing that stood out was the tenderness of the pork and it wasn’t greasy at all. The use of light sour cream and queso fresco in the taco really enhanced the pork’s flavor. The (big) burrito was a bit bland, but their salsa gave it that extra kick. And even though I’m not a fan of Mexican rice, this rice was superbly plump and the pinto beans were juicy (just the way my mom makes them). The corn was also yummy, although it wasn’t grilled which I don’t mind at all because the steam preserves the corn’s flavor and juices, they did overload it with chile powder but the side of lemon cools it off. Hopefully Endless Summer (without the brotherly bickering inside) will still be around this hot season.

This "guest" blogger has worn out her welcome. 1) I can't take anyone seriously who points out that the pork "wasn’t greasy at all" as if this were a good thing. Grease is one of the things that make meat a sensual delight. Go back to your tofu burger. 2) If you're using the word "yummy," you are either under 8 years old or insufferably precious. Did the food make your "tum tum" smile, too?

 Food and Wine's Best New Chefs 2008 has been announced. Michael Psilakis is the lone New Yorker in the bunch (above, with business partner Donatella Arpaia). From F&W's bio we learn that Psilakis "earned a degree in accounting and finance before a job as a waiter at T.G.I Friday's led him to reconsider..." Those goblet-sized Long Island iced teas will do that to a young man. We can only imagine that Psilakis is feeling on top of the world these days. (Or he's having anxiety-ridden dreams of losing it all, à la David Chang) Psilakis' Anthos is a nominee for James Beard's Best New Restaurant award, and the chef's newest restaurant, Mia Dona, has just been glowingly two starred by the Bruni.

 This week, Our Man is in Astoria, eating grilled pig at Arcos, a Portuguese churrasqueira. He loves the place, especially the charcoal-grilled suckling pig: "...wads of dark luscious meat interleaved with layers of fluffy white fat into a sort of carnivorous napoleon. Barely adhering, the burnished skin perched on top as light and crisp as a potato chip." A carnivorous napoleon? This makes us crave suckling pig and it's not even 9am. Damn you, Our Man! It turns out the restaurant grills three or four "very small pigs" every Friday and Saturday. Other days of the week, Our Man recommends the pork chops, and reminds us not to miss the excellent homemade potato chips. Arcos isn't all about the meat, it also specializes in seafood, like grilled octopus in lemon and garlic and clams steamed in wine, parsley and garlic. Also! Our Man discovers a "chourico sausage of Ron Jeremy length," enjoys a $22 bottle of Monte Velho, loves the salt cod fritters, and finds only one item on the menu that's a total flop.

NY Best Markets: Golan Gourmet Imports

POST:
 As part of the ongoing Best Markets series, today we're trekking to deepest Brooklyn to shop at Golan Gourmet Imports, an Israeli market that specializes in dried fruit and nuts. It's a smallish, neighborhood market, packed with dried fruits, teas, candies and bins of nuts. The dried fruits look uniformly good, and there's a fantastic variety available— everything from fat slices of California pears, peaches and nectarines to whole, diminutive cherry apples (which I've never seen before) and many kinds of dates and apricots. Best Buys: Golan Gourmet's Zaatar: this savory mixture of oregano, sesame seeds, sumac and salt is a common, and delicious, Middle Eastern seasoning. I like to sprinkle it on a cream-cheese-smeared bagel, or spoon it over baked fish. ($2.49 for 8 ounces) Over in the refrigerated section are vacuum-packed bags of bright pink cold smoked salmon steaks. Also in the refrigerated section, you can find schug, a little-known Israeli hot sauce. It's actually more of a paste, made from red chiles, vinegar, tomatoes and herbs. You can use it as a dip, a condiment—it's especially good mixed into hummus. And apparently, it's also great with the Yemeni bread called malawah, which you can also find here in the freezer section. (Pikante brand; $3.99) Date syrup: Pour it over yogurt, or combine it with equal parts tahini for a traditional sweet-nutty dip. The syrup tastes like a liquid raw sugar and can also be used in baking wherever honey is called for. Golan Gourmet Imports 1348 Coney Island Ave (at Avenue J) Brooklyn, NY 11230 (718) 338-1040

As of an hour ago on this sunny Friday afternoon there was no wait at all at DiFara's. And lucky me, a gorgeous square pie had just come out of the oven. As you probably know, DiFara's is frequently cited as having the very best pizza in the city, but there are often crippling waits and crowds of pushy "foodies" that make getting a pie impossible. Oh, you want some glamour shots of the prettiest pizza around? Here you go.

The Early Word: Savarona 
AUTHOR:
Sarah DiGregorio
DATE:

POST:
 By the time you get to Savarona, a new Turkish restaurant, you're practically in Queens. The restaurant is right next to a health club, in a large building that faces the Queensboro bridge. By the time I trekked over there (just east of 1st Avenue) and walked in, I was starting to feel dubious. The restaurant looks generically fancy, like a hotel restaurant. If not for the bridge out the window, you could be anywhere—It's all white tablecloths, awkwardly formal service and an older, quiet crowd. Lately, I've been to several sleek and flashy downtown restaurants that turn out to be all glitz and no flavor. Savarona is exactly the opposite. The food is really good—the product of a coherent vision and careful, caring execution. It's even worth a trip to the banks of the East River (especially if your parents are in town). Chef Tevfik Alparslan is taking traditional dishes and flavors and jolting them into the 21st century, doing things like topping an old-school Ottoman wedding soup with beet foam. Ideas like that sound like a stretch, but actually taste great. Presentation here is hilariously flamboyant. Some dishes come out with gigantic engraved silver domes on top, which are dramatically removed by the servers. Beef kabobs came skewered on an elaborate, Moorish looking sword. The server set down the plate and then de-skewered the kabobs with a flourish of the sword. It's ballsy to feature that kind of earnest spectacle these days. Best dishes: Beef kabobs with sour apple and dried apricot in a tart pomegranate sauce, with stewed eggplant on the side Modern Mezze Platter: various savory eggplant dips, salty, bubbly, baked "Turkish cream cheese," and other mezze Cabbage stuffed with bulger wheat, flavored with currents and cinnamon, in a tart yogurt sauce Grilled Mediterranean sea bass wrapped in grape leaves with cauliflower purée and fried chanterelles

Our Man and Fork in the Road: BBQ Extravaganza

POST:
 You might say you've had enough barbecue. You might mention the countless 'cue coverage in anticipation of Memorial Day weekend, and the Big Apple Barbecue that's just around the corner. But Our Man and I aren't so easily distracted from fatty meat or fire. We are dedicated to these things! So this week, we have joined forces to review two new barbecue joints. Our Man definitely got the better of this deal—he's at Madangsui, a new "fashion-forward" Korean barbecue place on 35th Street. While Our Man is disappointed to find that the restaurant's claim to be a wood-grilling establishment is an outright lie (the grills are gas) he finds plenty to enjoy: On the other hand, I did not love Wildwood, which I found glib and sleek and very uneven. This BR Guest restaurant is setting itself up to be a chain what deals in all regional cue, from Texan brisket to Carolina pulled pork and everything in between. That's where Wildwood goes wrong. I've eaten barbecue around the country, and I'm here to tell you that just because a pitmaster makes great burnt ends in Kansas City doesn't mean he knows how to make a fantastic smoked brisket in Texas. Each kind of barbecue represents generations of passed-down knowledge—and all the money in the world can't buy that experience. Madangsui 35 West 35th Street 212-564-9333 Wildwood Barbeque 225 Park Avenue South 212-533-2500 Leader of the pack, and first thing on the barbecue menu, is saeng deung sim ($26.99). I hesitate to spoil the surprise, but this entrée turns out to be a prime boneless rib eye, glorious in its intact entirety and gorgeously marbled. Meat doesn’t get any pornier than that. Throw it on the grill, and smoke instantly snakes upward into the surreal ductwork. Take a last admiring look at the entire steak, because the waitress soon goes after it with scissors, cutting it into pieces that multiply the proportion of sizzling surface area.

I'm disapointed in the WWBBQ review as well, it's my new favorite spot, its always busy and upholds the standards of great service we've come to expect from BR Guest. The beer is ice cold, the staff is diverse, and the food is well priced... what's not to like?

New York's Best Markets: Patel Brothers
AUTHOR:

POST:
 Wandering the aisles of a supermarket in a foreign country is one of the world's best tourist activities. But you can do this at home, too, in one of New York's various ethnic markets. So today, I'm debuting the Best Markets series. I'll periodically highlight markets in New York that are worth a leisurely visit, and the items you might want to bring home to your kitchen. Today, one that's probably familiar: Patel Brothers in Jackson Heights, Queens. This large Indian grocery is always well stocked and crowded. During Indian mango season, they have boxes of mangoes piled higher than my head. For cheap home cooking, the sacks of different daals can't be beat, and you can find atta flour for chapati-making, besan flour for besan ladoo (chickpea sweets) as well as mustard oil, good tea and incense. Best buys: In the refrigerated section, there are stacks of fresh parathas and chapatis. Just warm them up in a dry skillet and they turn soft, chewy and aromatic. My favorites: Plain whole wheat chapatis and methi (fenugreek) parathas. Delicious Foods brand; each package $2.50. Patel Brothers chili powder is pretty fiery, but also has a hearty, coarse texture and mouth-filling flavorfulness that sets it apart. I'm always glad I have it in the cabinet. And it's a fantastic deal: $2.99 for 13 ounces, in an easy-to-store plastic jug. Canned Alphonso mango pulp is brilliantly saffron-colored and has a sweet, almost floral taste. Pour it over vanilla ice cream. Ratna brand, $2.99 Canned patra is a little strange when you first encounter it, but it becomes a habit awfully quickly. It's a concoction of colocassia leaves mixed with a hot spice paste. The green leaves and the yellow spice paste get rolled together into a cylinder and jammed into a can. When you open the can, shake out the cylinder whole. It looks bizarre and a little unappetizing, but bear with me. Slice the cylinder into thin circles, and pan-fry each circle, browning each side. It's vibrantly spicy, vegetal and crisp on the outside. Swad brand patra; $0.99 Dry garlic chutney is like an all-in-one seasoning. You can mix it with a little oil to make a traditional chutney dip, or you can use it dry, sprinkling it on fish, grilled corn or french fries. $1.99 Patel Brothers 3727 74th St Jackson Heights, NY 11372 (718) 898-3445

Memorial Day Special: Lazy Picnic Eats

POST:
 It's Memorial Day weekend, prime time for park picnicking and general lolling around in the sun. The new branch of DUB Pies, which is a block away from Prospect Park, turns out buttery-crusted, savory New Zealand-style pies. They are completely perfect picnic food—hand-held and sufficient unto themselves. The curry vegetable (above) contains a sort of pleasantly mushy pub-style curry, and the shepard’s pie holds tender chunks of beef inside and is topped with a crisped layer of mashed potatoes. If you're lying around in Central Park, you can now order in. Nanoosh Hummus Bar will send a delivery person to hand-carry hummus to your lazy self. Okay, you do have to get yourself to the West 75th or West 65th entrance, but still. As a special, Nanoosh is offering a dip picnic tray for four, with hummus, tahini, lebane, carrots, celery, broccoli, and pita for $23.95.

 Brooklyn's Chinatown, on 8th Avenue in Sunset Park, is one of my favorite places to eat. That cart pictured to the right is at 55th Street and 8th Avenue. The woman inside makes all sorts of noodles—chewy cylindrical steamed rice noodles, and nicely al dente fried lo mein. She also makes those silver-dollar-sized sweet, eggy cakes that you get by the dozen in little wax paper sacks. More, after the jump  To the left, Cantonese barbecue at Sun's BBQ Restaurant (4924 8th Avenue).  Mmmmm....bahn mi. Above, the barbecue pork version from Tan Thanh (5818 7th Avenue).

Our Man Sietsema and the Franken-cue
AUTHOR:

POST:
 Our Man Sietsema has been following Anita Lo through the good—Mirezi and Annisa—and the bad—Rickshaw Dumpling Bar (serving dumplings that Our Man finds truly sub-par). Now she's opened an Asian barbecue place, Bar Q, and Our Man sets out to review it with a mixture of excitement and trepidatioin. And...he's not in love. But here's some good news: But things don't go well from there. The baby back ribs with "my mother's barbecue sauce" don't hold up under Our Man's scrutiny, seeming to have been "dumped out of a white carton from the local Chinese carryout." Youch. Sounds like a case of a few good dishes, a bunch of middling ones and some disasterous. A big, fat "meh." In the end, Our Man damns with faint praise: “Stuffed” spareribs ($29) hunker in a lake of chunky peanut sauce, a boneless mass of composed meat that might be mistaken as a model for a Henry Moore sculpture. It’s delicious, though the sauce is superfluous. Equally mouth-worthy is a tuna rib appetizer ($15) – a pile of long fragile bones barely coated with tasty gray meat, black striped from the grill. If you’ve never tasted tuna ribs before, it’s probably because other chefs throw them away. The popularity of American-style barbecue spots seems to be spawning all sorts Franken-cues. If Bar Q is the last big-ticket “Asian barbecue” we’ll be seeing this season, I’ll be surprised. Certainly, it won’t be the worst.

Fork in the Road Reviews The New French

 This week, FitR's column in the paper is a review of The New French, the new (not French) restaurant in the West Village. It's a sweet little place, with a menu that jumbles together things like burgers, pho, vegetable curry and mussels with fries. But it grew on me, because it's the sort of menu that you'd like your (hypothetical) chef friend to cook for you at home, if that makes any sense. These are all dishes that people love eating and cooking. And the story of how the place got its nonsensical name is in the review, if you're curious.

Wii's Competive Eating Game Launch

POST:
 As far as competitive eating goes, I thought watermelon would be pretty tame. Turns out, not so much. It's a big mess, actually. I went to Nintendo World at Rockefeller Center today to watch Tim "Eater X" Janus and Crazy Legs Conti battle it out with watermelon slices both real and virtual. That screen shot above is Crazy Legs and Eater X's Wii doppelgangers, eating burritos. (I couldn't get one showing the watermelon, so you'll just have to use your imagination.) First, the two eaters battled it out with real watermelon, then they played the new Wii competitive eating game, their cartoon likenesses downing virtual watermelon on the screen. The reality-based competition (as the Bush administration would call it) was highly entertaining. Watermelon has a lot of bulk to it. The two of them went at it like chipmunks, their cheeks stuffed and juice pouring down their chins. In a big upset, Crazy Legs, who is lower ranked than Eater X, won the 6 minute competition. He prevailed by one bite—15 wedges to 15 wedges and one bite. Drama! Then the two played the new Wii competitive eating game, which actually looks like it might get old really quickly (although watching people play video games is always dull). Basically, you pick up the food (watermelon in this case) with a movement of your hand, and then place it in your mouth and chew by hitting the "B" button. You have to keep track of your "barf-o-meter" though, because if you throw up ("suffer an unfortunate reversal) you loose. You can out-wit your opponent by doing things like burping at him or her. Gross. Anyway! The virtual Crazy Legs threw up all his watermelon, leaving Eater X the overall winner of the day. Eater X and Crazy Legs are actually roommates. (I'm profiling them as they prepare for Nathan's Hot Dog Contest on July 4th, so check in the paper for that story this summer.)

 Wine Enthusiast's Toast of the Town was at Lincoln Center last night. It was the sort of thing where way too many tipsy people were lurching around, trying to juggle wine glasses and plates of food. But hey, I was tipsy too, so I can't complain. There were hundreds of different wines to taste and plenty of food from restaurants around the city. The best dishes: Thalassa's raw diver scallops with roe mousse Ilili's lamb dumplings with minted yogurt and fried sweetbreads Devi's mushrooms with fenugreek on brioche toasts We also really liked Fess Parker's Pinot Noirs and just about every Champagne, because I'm a sucker like that. I also tried Serendipity's frozen hot chocolate, for the first time—that's the stuff that everyone stands in line for? It tasted like a frappuccino to me.

The food tastes good, but is predictable and overpriced. It hits the words of the moment: cocktails, poached egg, paté, spring lamb. On a Saturday night, an entertaining parade of pretty people catwalks through the dining room. The space is all black and white with silver skulls (edgy!) scattered throughout. Best things to eat and drink: Grilled prawns (the big, fat ones with heads on) with spicy tomato relish and chive aioli Poached duck egg in a bowl, scattered with corn and little bits of chorizo (Everyone's a sucker for oozy yolk) Beef tartare, a little underseasoned, but with admirably hearty, large chunks of beef, topped with a raw quail egg and horseradish cream The Double Down cocktail: tequila, lime, cucumber slices and serrano chiles

AUTHOR:

POST:
A Casa Fox is the outgrowth of a successful catering company that's well known for empanadas. We stopped in last night for dinner—the room is very small, and appealing in an intentionally mismatched knick-knack, stone wall, wobbly wooden tables, fireplace kind of way. The cutesy-boho thing going on reminded us of a coffee shop. There's a pared down menu with a bunch of empanada varieties, some small plates and five "clay pot" main courses. We got the mini empanada selection, which was great—the crusts were crisp and very hot, and the fillings ranged from earthy mushroom to pleasantly oily chorizo to melty queso fresco. The main dishes, though, were fine but a bit disappointing, especially given the hefty prices. They come in hot clay dishes, but clearly haven't been cooked in those clay dishes, so I'm not sure what the point of the whole production is. I had marinated, slow-cooked pork ribs, which were very tasty, tender and flavorful and not too fatty. But they cost $24, and the sides of black beans and rice were okay, but underseasoned and very run-of-the-mill. You could get something similar for less than half the cost at any Spanish-American place on the corner. We also tried the shredded chicken with carrots, which was, again, fine, but unexciting. It's not that the main courses were bad, but they were lacking the zest and thoughtfulness that should go into cooking if you want to charge over 20 dollars for a plate. Don't forget to ask for their homemade hot sauce if you go. It's fantastic—bright orange with habaneros, but so skillfully made that the sauce ends up being more flavorful than fiery. To sum up: A Casa Fox has serviceable pan-Central American for the pretty LES set, with prices to match. A Casa Fox 173 Orchard St 212-253-1900

BPeace offers grants, training and support for female entrepreneurs in conflict and post-conflict regions like Afghanistan and Rwanda. It is composed of an international network of business professionals who volunteer to help the women build their own businesses—something that both alleviates poverty and helps foster peace. The idea is that more jobs equal more peace, something that makes sense when you think about it. BPeace is helping several food businesses get off the ground, including a tomato paste company and a raisin producer, both in Afghanistan. Before the gala, I had the chance to interview Bastianich briefly about BPeace and where she's been eating lately. Tell us about what entrepreneurship means to you and why BPeace's work is important? My achievements, like anyone's, have social and philosophical value, but the economic value also needs to be there. That puts you in a forum in which people will pay attention to your ideas. The women and men who volunteer for BPeace give of their knowledge and their money to start someone else's life down that path. This not only makes a difference in others' lives, but also it says that we are all on the same level philosophically. What steps did you need to take to become a successful businessperson? Well, in the United States, the opportunity is here. And I had the strength of my family behind me, not just emotionally but physically, my mother making pasta. And they helped me financially, they gave me seed money. BPeace offers seed money to these entrepreneurs, and that's the first step, which enables them to get to the second step. The second step is to feel confident enough that you are producing something of value that other people will pay for. My life has come in a complete circle, and I'd like to give someone else the same chance that I had. What restaurants have you been enjoying lately? I go to most new restaurants because most are friends. I happen to enjoy Asian food quite a bit, and I like Momofuku Noodle Bar, and I love eating in Chinatown. I enjoy Egyptian...to me, food communicates a culture, so I always compare what I'm eating to Italian—what ingredients they use, what they do it.

Bpeace does not give money and, from the conversations I've heard, they are not interested in becoming a microloan organization. In Rwanda they created a relationship with a bank that offers microloans and then tell the entrepreneurs in Rwanda to work with that bank to get the loan. Bpeace will give little $500 grants for "emergencies" but it has to be deemed necessary by the powers that be. Bpeace's main export is US business women's knowledge and technical support.

 A knowledgeable reader wrote in to enlighten me that West Virginia does indeed have its very own food stuff—the West Virginia pepperoni roll. According to West Virginia Pepperoni Rolls website, these are composed of "a few thin slices of pepperoni baked in a soft, golden oval of slightly sweet dough, smaller than a dinner roll." Things I have learned since yesterday: West Virginians like pepperoni rolls and also they are racist. Very.

Our Man's Sietsema's Una Pizza Napoletana Re-Visit
AUTHOR:
Sarah DiGregorio

POST:
We here at the VV (Our Man Sietsema and myself) are trying to keep our dining guide current by re-visiting places that we haven't been to for a while, to see if they merit a change of heart in one way or another. Today, I got this nice note from Our Man Sietsema, who has recently been back to Una Pizza Napoletana. (That gorgeous, mouthwatering shot of the pizza was not, sadly, taken at Una Pizza Napoletana, but at a pizza joint that's much less convenient to get to. In Naples.) Quoth Our Man: Hey Sarah – Just got back from revisiting Una Pizza Napoletana in the East Village, which I reviewed – but did not particularly like – almost four years ago. The joint was founded by a pizza wrangler from the Jersey shore who worshipped the pies made in Naples, Italy, the original home of pizza (though a good case can be made for pizza as we know it being invented at Lombardi’s, in Manhattan). To this end, he mounts a very spare menu, comprising only four pies. And, really, that’s the extent of it – no salads or antipasti whatsoever. As in Naples, the pies are personal-size and intended to be eaten with a knife and fork. It seems like pizzaiolo at Una Pizza Napoletana goes out of his way to make his pies uneven in size and shape, as if rebelling against the very circle itself. The place looks Naples-ish enough, all tile and off-white paint, very plain except for a few tasteful prints recalling Campania’s religious heritage, with the austerity broken only by a string of Xmas lights up near the ceiling. A giant beehive wood oven commands the back of the room, waiting to be fed. The pies arrive literally smoking, with charred dough on one side or the other. I ate the standard margherita, which shocked me with its $21 price tag, Sicilian sea salt or not. It was good, but a little too substantially charred for my taste, and the “bone” (the thickest part of the crust) was a little too doughy. Still, as an example of the Naples style, it was about 95% there. The other pizza I tried, the bianca, was a white pie (well, duh!) with a heavy dose of buffalo mozzarella on top. To begin with, Naples pizzerias almost never use buffalo mozzarella, preferring the fiore di latte that is the equivalent of our Italian-American mozzarella. While I don’t usually argue with dairy generosity, this pie had too much cheese, lending a rubbery quality to the pie. In Naples, when they apply cheese, it is in small chunks, as you can see below in a picture I took at Da Michele in Naples not too long ago: In conclusion, while I find the pies at Una Pizza Napoletana interesting from an intellectual and historic perspective, and a worthy addition to the amazing pizza landscape of New York City, when I crave pizza, I’m likely to go elsewhere. --Robert

The pizza at Baci & Abbracci in Williamsburg, a ristorante owned by 2 southern Italian immigrants, beats Una Pizza Napoletana by a mile. Far better made, and much more reasonably priced. The pizza siciliana is buonissima, with eggplant and great smoked mozzarella that isn't overly smoky.

 In honor of this weekend's subway series, FitR's column is all about where to eat around Yankee and Shea stadiums. The goal was to find eateries good for a quick bite or take out no more than a few blocks away from the stadium, places that you don't have make an extra subway stop to get to. (That left out delicious Flushing, which I realize is only one subway stop from Shea.) I found plenty of good stuff—from amazing curried goat at the Feeding Tree in the Bronx, to Ecuadorian ceviche and empanadas at La Ambateñita in Queens. And I found the place that supplies the Mets clubhouse with its after-game meal, and where you can sometimes find players or coaches hanging out. All of it lightyears better, in my opinion, than overpriced ballpark fare.

Our Man Sietsema finds Mexican on Arthur Avenue

POST:
 This week, Our Man tells us about a great Southern Mexican restaurant that's smack in the middle of the solidly Italian neighborhoood of Belmont, Bronx. Our Man zeros in on the Platillos Tradicionales, and he loves what he finds. The chicken mole poblano: He also enjoys the vegetarian chiles rellenos and the queso fundido con rajas, which came with fresh strips of multicolored chiles. Alrighty! Anyone else starving now? And what about this? Get there: Estrellita Poblana III 2328 Arthur Avenue Belmont, the Bronx, 718-220-7641 At Estrellita that afternoon, the thick mole flung off nut and cinnamon notes, as multiple chilies—both dried and fresh—went to work on my tongue. And further flavors continued to unfold as the bolus eased down my esophagus. In the middle, like the mother superior herself, sat the radiant taste of chocolate, with barely a trace of sweetness. Cemitas arrive on round seeded rolls that traditionally contain cactus pulp. Inside, you'll find layers of string cheese, avocado, onion, fragrant papalo leaves, refried beans, mayonnaise, and fiery smoked chilies.

 I'm sure there's plenty of good food to be had in West Virginia (Check out this gorgeous slice of pie on Road Food, for one thing), but does a distinctively West Virginian food exist? If it does, I can't find it. What's up, West Virginia? No hidden food gems, à la the pork tenderloin sandwich from Indiana? The most illustrious food contribution West Virginia has made to our fair country seems to be the Golden Delicious apple. Not a sexy find, I grant you. You can read the facinating account of the discovery of the Golden Delicious in this 1962 West Virginia Daily Mail article. And, finally, in honor of West Virginia's primaries-of-no-consquence today, here's a recipe for apple butter.

 We stopped by Ghenet Brooklyn, the new Ethiopian on 4th Avenue in Brooklyn last night. The space is tiny, and encircled with delicate metalwork screens. Since there were four of us, we got the Ghenet combination for four, which turned out to basically mean we got everything on the menu—all the vegetarian dishes, as well as doro watt (spiced chicken stew), and sega watt (spiced beef stew). The combo probably could have fed six—it arrived on an enormous plate, with injera layered below and also served on the side. The doro watt was wonderful—bone-in chicken cooked in a thick, darkly spiced sauce with a boiled egg alongside. And all the vegetarian dishes were equally good. We particularly liked the earthy, lemony collard greens, the stewed red lentils and the cabbage and potatoes. We ate until we couldn't. And the combo was only about $55—a good deal, a good meal, we're fans.

The editor probably came up with that very vivid image to sex things up a little, in a manner of speaking. No worries, foie-gras-haters.

 This week, Fork in the Road talks to chefs who are grappling with the crazy-bad euro/dollar exchange rate. The problem is not that they can't afford a Paris vacation—no, it's that all those delicious things that come from Europe (like cheese, wine, Mediterranean fish, chanterelles and truffles) are now ridiculously expensive. They can raise prices, but only so much—would you pay $22 dollars for a glass of Champagne? In some cases, that's how much chefs would have to charge to maintain any profit margin. So the chefs are sourcing other ingredients and changing their menus to stay both profitable and relatively affordable.

Actually the percentage of mark up doesn't matter it's the profit margin that matters. Yes wine and liquor are marked up--but that said--many restaurants depend on the hefty drink margin to turn any kind of profit in such a high overhead business.

Champagne is a poor choice to demonstrate the problem. Wine and liquor are ridiculously marked up, far more than any food item. A rise in price of 50% means less loss of revenue when said item is marked up 400% on the menu.

 This week, Our Man has discovered a Nigerian place in East New York, Brooklyn—and he is really psyched, because although Our Man frequents all manner of African places around the city, a reliable Nigerian spot had eluded him until now. Not anymore! Enter Festac Grill, where chef/owner Abiodun Imasuen serves several dishes that Our Man thinks are fantastic. (Although he has to convince her that he does indeed like spice before she'll let him order.) When Imasuen is finally persuaded that Our Man really does want to sample her wares, she comes up with a wonderful goat pepper soup, "bursting" with offal—"kidney, liver, tripe, jelly-like skin, and other anatomic features normally known only to veterinarians." Our Man also enjoys a simpler fish pepper soup, and the poached porgy. Our Man also approves of the bar snacks, including beef kebabs coated in crushed peanuts. On a related note, I just found this website, which has a bunch of Nigerian recipes, in case you want to try those dishes at home.

Texas has barbecue and Tex-Mex, California has tacos and burgers, Massachusetts has clam chowder and the Carolinas have pulled pork. The non-stop Indiana primary coverage made me wonder what dish Indiana is known for. A first round of Google searching turned up the fact that Indiana produces a lot of corn, which doesn't quite qualify. But then I came across references to the pork tenderloin sandwich—sounds generic, but it's not. Turns out, this is a very particular sandwich, related to pork schnitzel, but always made with tenderloin, and always deep fried rather than shallow-fried. It's pounded thin, marinated overnight, breaded, fried and then served on a soft white bun with lettuce, tomato, onion and mayo. There's even a documentary dedicated to the search for the perfect specimen, called "In Search of the Famous Hoosier Breaded Pork Tenderloin Sandwich." You can watch an excerpt here. There's an awesome blog dedicated to the pork tenderloin sandwich, featuring glamor shots of the porky goodness at various eateries (the guy seems to eat at least two a day) as well as a photo tutorial and recipes for making your own. Any ex-Hoosiers out there know if this deliciousness is to be had in New York?

It is next to impossible to find a good one, even in Indiana, these days. When I was a kid and spent summers with my aunt we would always stop for lunch at the same truck stop when we traveled between Indianapolis and Elkhart. The sandwiches were to die for. The tenderloins were twice the size of the bun and melted in your mouth. I've made three trips back in the last 5 years and have searched for a good tenderloin sandwich every time. I've eaten some of the worst excuses for that childhood favorite imaginable. The best ones I get still come from my own kitchen.

We haven't lived in Indiana for 25 years, but grew up in Fort Wayne, consuming untold numbers of pork tenderloin sandwiches from drive-in restaurants like the defunct Gardner's, to neighborhood bars such as the Acme Bar & Grill, which we patronize during all too infrequent visits. We live in North Carolina - the concept of the breaded pork tenderloin is foreign in these parts, unfortunately.

I just moved to Wilmington NC from Indiana 3 years ago and crave the tenderloin sandwich. The best Ive had is The Bank in Pendleton, IN. Every time I go back to IN Im getting a beer battered tenderloin covering the bun with tomato, lettuce, onions, pickles, mayo and honeymustard. Im surprised nobody has mentioned where it all started in Indiana. As the story goes there were two brothers one of which owned a restaurant/bar in Southern Indiana and the other was quite a drinker. Well one night the drinking brother had a little too much to drink and the other brother kicked him out of the bar. Well the drunk brother ended up stumbling down the road a ways and ended up falling into a ditch. A horrible blizzard came down that night and it turns out the drunk brother ended up getting terrible frost bite and lost both his hands, had to cut them off right at the wrist giving him two stumps. Well the proprietor brother, feeling bad, wanted to help his drinking brother get back on his feet after the accident and gave him a job... in the kitchen... and what else could he do with the two stumps at the end of each arm... what else? Thats right... pound the pork loin until it was nice and tender... henceforth known as the tenderloin. Just a little Hoosier History Lesson you might not have known! Just dont ask where the name Hoosier came from - thats a whole 'nother story!

Sarah, Thanks for the mention of my web site porktenderloinsandwich.com. It is just a fun pursuit. Yes, there have been some two a day tenderloins but that is rare. The breaded pork tenderloin sandwich is pretty much a Midwest sandwich ubiquitous to Indiana, Illinois, Iowa and parts of the states that border those three. They are rarely found elsewhere and when found usually with some genesis from the Midwest. They have shown up in Texas, Florida, Arizona and California that way. I am not aware of any in the east other than the Dominion Restaurant in McLean, VA outside of Washington, DC. There are a lot of good tenderloins and they seem to me to be better and more popular than in the past based on my personal experience of pursuing them for 50 years. New York certainly deserves one. Maybe this will give someone inspiration.

Dooley O'Toole's in Carmel, IN, has the best ones in the Indianapolis area nowadays. Sadly, the truck stop ones that used to be so good seem to have all faded into history. So it falls to the erstatz-Irish pub restaurants to take up the mantle, somehow, and they generally do pretty good.

If any of you on your travels happen to pass through Franklin, Indiana, there is a family owned restaurant called The Checkered Flag. They serve wonderful Beef Manhattans to Double Cheeseburgers. However, they have the most tender pork tenderloins I have ever tasted. They are located on Hurricane Street, just south of Arvin Road...if you're interested.

In Lawence, Kansa back in the 1950's there was a diner on the main street, not far from the bridge over the Kaw river that made pork tenderloin sandwiches. Unfortunately, I haven't had one since those KU days. Here in New York, I"ve never found anyone who has even heard of it, much less seen it on a menu. Folks out here don't know what they're missing. I guess I'll have to make my own.

 The other day, a man with the most amazing accent called me up. After I got over the loveliness of the phrase "good on you," which I think translates as "thank you," I discovered that I was speaking to Simon Morton, host of This Way Up on Radio New Zealand, and that he wanted me to speak on his show about New York's calorie listing law. Turns out, New Zealanders are both incredulous and fascinated about our nanny state leanings—first they came for the smokers, then the transfats, and now you can't even enjoy a rainbow cookie at Starbucks without realizing you're about to get really, really fat. I did the interview last Wednesday, the day after the law actually went into effect (on Tuesday, the stay requested by the Restaurant Association was denied). But restaurants who don't post the calories won't be fined until July, so many are not complying yet. You can hear the interview (and Simon's accent) here.

Weather Up: Shmancy Cocktails in Prospect Heights

POST:
 We stopped by Kathryn Weatherup's new cocktail bar, Weather Up (get it?) this weekend to see what was what. There were two bartenders working—a tattooed, tank-top wearing woman and a mustachioed (naturally), tie-wearing guy. Both apparently trained under Milk and Honey's Sasha Petraske, and both were very, very serious. The place has no sign, but can be spotted by the shiny facade, which is done up in smooth white tile that reminds me of an operating room. The small room was busy, but not packed, and they were playing Motown, which is always, always welcome. The cocktail list sports about a dozen classic drinks, like the Brooklyn, classic daiquiri, dark and stormy and gin fizz. I got a Weather Up, cognac, amaretto and lemon, which was tasty but a little too sweet. I did like the enormous piece of orange peel it was garnished with, because every time I took a sip I got a big, refreshing whiff of orange. But if I'm going to pay $11 to $15 for a cocktail, I do like for there to be a little bit of comfort involved. There isn't much seating, so you're lucky if you can snag a seat at the bar. And for some reason, the bar doesn't have a foot rest, so if your legs aren't long, you're dangling like a six year old. If you can deal with the price tag, though, this is a nice option to have in the neighborhood. But I don't think I'd make a special trip from Manhattan. As we were sitting there, watching the very serious bartenders pour and shake, my boyfriend commented that, as trends go, cocktail geekiness is one that's easy to get behind.

First Lady Paterson Greens the Mansion, Enjoys Thai Food
AUTHOR:

2008-05-1 15:45:00
POST:
 Having come to the Governor's mansion in, ahem, less than ideal circumstances, Michelle Paige Paterson is moving forward with several healthy eating initiatives that make considerably more appetizing headlines. Today, Paterson announced that she would continue the local and organic food program that was launched last year at the Governor's mansion. The mansion chef buys local and organic produce whenever possible, shopping from a CSA program and a food co-op for New York state-grown produce. Additionally, Paterson is working with eleven middle schools in Harlem on a project called Healthy Steps. Each student is given a pedometer, and the class to collectively reach four million steps wins a trip to Albany for a meal at the mansion with the Governor and First Lady, as well as a trip to an upstate organic farm. Mush, children, mush! Our Q&A with the First Lady on where she likes to eat in the city, and why healthy eating is important to her, after the jump. Tell us about the food program at the governor’s mansion. The local and organic food program is one of the initiatives that’s part of the greening of the mansion. We buy locally because it helps the economy. And organic food doesn’t have antibiotics and hormones, which makes it healthier. Why are these issues so important to you? Does it relate to your profession in healthcare? It relates to my work in healthcare, I’m the director of an integrated wellness program, it’s a program based on healthy living for people with chronic conditions. But I’m also concerned as a mother; I’m very concerned about childhood obesity. To see children in the last couple years just blow up is a real concern to me. That’s why I started the healthy steps program a year ago. What sorts of dishes have you requested from your chef? Is it a big change to have someone cooking for you? My family is used to eating healthy, I’ve always been such a health person, so it’s not such a big change for us. We told our chef, Noah, about the things we like to eat, and he prepares them for us. Mr. Paterson never cooked much, but it’s a big change and a welcome change for me. I’m so busy juggling work and family, it’s very hard to cook. And that’s a big problem for everyone: kids are eating McDonald’s and processed foods because the parents are so busy and it’s easier to give the kids money to go to McDonalds. For me, having someone to prepare meals helps me greatly. What’s next for you—do you have any plans for future initiatives related to food? Actually, I’m looking to do something similar to Healthy Steps, in schools in Rochester next year. I think it’s very important to get kids involved excited about eating healthy exercising. We need to let them know that healthy food can taste good. When you’re in New York City, what restaurants do you like eat at? I tend to like Thai food. I try to go to restaurants that to cook healthy, that don’t use so much processed food. David and I recently had lunch with Ted Turner at one of his restaurants, the Montana Grill. It’s very healthy, they don’t use meat with any antibiotics, they don’t use plastics, and they’re very interested in helping the environment. I’m sure neither of you has time now, but when your family cooks what do you like to prepare? We eat a lot of chicken and fish, stir-fries with vegetables…David does like lamb, so every now and then we’ll eat lamb chops What would people be surprised to see in your fridge? Well you know, just because we eat healthy doesn’t mean we never eat anything unhealthy. We eat in moderation—everything in moderation.

 Jason Sheehan, the critic out at our sister paper, The Denver Westword, has written a lengthy, rapturous blog post about a dinner at Le Bernadin. It's worth a read, not only because Sheehan is such a good writer, but also because in this city of snark it's nice to be reminded of what sheer, unadulterated enjoyment sounds like. Read it here. A highlight: "Honest to Jesus kids, I wish I could remember the meal itself with more specificity. I know there was sole at one point, a bordelaise sauce teased with a spoon of something that might’ve been liquefied foie gras and tasted like nothing I’ve ever had before -- like wine must and deep, purple sweetness and butter and fat all at the same time, kept warm for me under a gleaming silver cloche when I had to duck out briefly for a breath. And I know there was a plate of something that involved bacon which, in our half-drunk and complete dizzy excitement, actually caused all three of us at the table to simultaneously cheer."

 This week we're playing recipe improv with Jehangir Mehta, who was a pastry chef at Jean Georges, Union Pacific, Virot, Compass, Aix, and Sapa before striking out on his own with Graffiti Food and Wine Bar. At Graffiti, Mehta concocts both savory and sweet dishes, often mixing flavors in unexpected ways. The improv ingredients: Cauliflower, vanilla and scallops The result: Vanilla Balsamic Scallops with Garlic Cauliflower Yield: 2 servings 4 large scallops 1 tablespoon aged Balsamic vinegar 1 vanilla bean, split and scraped 3 teaspoons olive oil, divided salt and freshly ground pepper 2 cups cauliflower florets 9 cloves garlic, sliced 12 cherry tomatoes, halved In a bowl, combine the scallops with balsamic vinegar, vanilla bean, 1 teaspoon olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper. Set aside to marinate for 30 minutes. Remove scallops from marinade, and discard marinade. In a skillet over medium-high heat, warm 1 teaspoon of the olive oil, and sear the scallops for 2 minutes on each side. Set aside. Bring a pot of salted water to boil, and blanch cauliflower for 1 1/2 minutes. Drain. In a large skillet over medium heat, warm the remaining teaspoon of olive oil. Add the garlic, and fry until light brown. Add the cauliflower and tomatoes, and season with salt and pepper to taste. Sauté for 2 to 3 minutes, or until cauliflower is tender, and tomatoes are soft. Serve the scallops on a bed of the cauliflower.

The Story Behind the Restaurant Formerly Known as Chickpea
AUTHOR:
Sarah DiGregorio
DATE:
2008-06-27 14:38:00
POST:
Eater reported that Kosher Village had changed its name for the second time in three months (Chickpea to Kosher Village to Tahini), so I stopped by to find out what was going on. Turns out, owner Nissim Oron didn't realize that there weren't enough Orthodox Jewish people in the East Village to sustain a glatt kosher restaurant, a designation that requires closing on shabbat and for holidays, an expensive proposition. "After three months I realized that this neighborhood is not the one for glatt kosher," Oron said. "Only about 10 percent of our customers were coming in because it was glatt kosher. So I thought I'd go back to being just kosher, not glatt kosher, and so not to confuse anyone, we took 'kosher' out of the name." Yes, changing the name again should completely eliminate any confusion. And as you might remember, the restaurant formerly known as Chickpea ran a contest to find the new name. 10,000 names were submitted, Kosher Village and Tahini among them. Oron awarded $30,000 in prize money to the genius who came up with Kosher Village—a rate that would turn out to be $10,000 for each month the name was in effect. So would Oron be giving anything to the Tahini submitter? "I want to give him something," Oron said. "But I haven't decided what yet."

Hope they make a fair decision on how to award the Tahini submitter(s). A friend of mine is one of them but never been informed on this decision personally. If there are multiple, shouldn't it be split among, or the first submitter gets all?

There's nothing more fun than reading British restaurant reviews. They use words like "tiddly" and they do negativity with unmatched glee. Here's what The Observer's Jay Rayner recently wrote about a high-end vegan restaurant: I am glad that vegans now have somewhere funky to go. Then again, I'm also glad fully grown men who like to wear nappies and pretend to be babies have clubs they can go to indulge their desires, too. It doesn't mean I want to be a member. But this week, Rayner's column is an experiment in empathy for the dark side—he goes vegan for a week. Why? "Morris dancing and incest aside, it's hard to criticise something unless you've tried it." The story is hilarious; check it out here. A highlight: Until that moment it hadn't occurred to me that honey was forbidden in the vegan diet. After all, honey doesn't come pouring out of the tiddly bee's honey duct, does it? It is manufactured outside their delightful stripy bodies. But it belongs to the bee so it can't be used. After all we like the bee. We do not steal from the bee.

I don't know, is it really worth it to get too worked up over this guy? My daughter and have been vegans for about 6 years now and it's great! People enjoy my vegan cooking and most of the time don't realize the food they're eating is "vegan." Some of these people are now considering a vegan diet. Some things take time. I mean really, we live in a world where people voted for GW Bush twice (both elections shady), where some still insist global warming is a hoax, where women are still paid less than a man doing the same job, where children, men and women needlessly go without food, shelter, and medical care, where the country (USA) who accuses other countries of being part of the "Axis of Evil" has been one of the most prolific producers and most irrisponsible when it comes to WMD's, where we have/had sanctioned torture or killing by USA military at Guantanomo Bay, the late Suddam Hussein, and Zimbabwe's "president" Mugabe - the list goes on and on, unfortunately. Can we seriously expect or waste any time at all on wondering why one person can't figure out the finer points of a vegan diet? There are many things worth spending our time on. One food critic, who won't even take the time to study or test something before giving his critique of it really isn't one of them is he. Chao and happy vegan trails! ;oD

Veganism isn't about what I can't have; It's about a plant based diet and *choosing* to not eat animal product and byproducts. It's a particularly easy lifestyle to follow. The greatest difficulty I face would be people like the author who are ignorant and make a joke of veganism.

The reason Jay Rayner failed so many times and was such a bad vegan was because he went vegan for the wrong reasons. He wasn't thinking about animal suffering, environmental impacts of animal industries, or his own health. He obviously didn't want to do a good research prose on this topic. If he had, he would've researched common animal ingredients found in foods and would have read ALL ingredients. Yes, us vegans read ALL ingredients. So why did Jay look at the Thai curry ingredients AFTER he had already made it? Sounds fishy to me. Either way, he couldn't do it and was making fun of the whole experience. I know that it's good for someone to laugh at themselves, but veganism is also a serious issue to many of us. It's a lifestyle which we uphold with great regard, so when someone such as Jay does a half-assed job, it's pretty sad for me. With enough education and interest in the topic, he would've had no problems whatsoever.

BLT Market's Wild Blossom Cocktail Wins Drink Mix-Off

POST:
The Department of Consumer Affairs says that (legal) sidewalk cafés are at an all-time high—there are about 1,000 of them in the city. Eating at sidewalk cafés often requires a nice stiff drink to distract yourself from the fact that you're sitting right next to a dumpster or an idling car, so it's only appropriate that yesterday the DCA held their 3rd annual Sidewalk Café Drink Mix-Off. The judging panel included Arthur Schwartz, and in the end, BLT Market's Wild Blossom was victorious. Make it at home, and get in the spirit by sipping it on your stoop. It tastes better than a forty. Wild Blossom Yield: 1 cocktail Adapted from mixologist James Scarito 2 ounces Plymouth Gin 3/4 ounce St. Germain Elderflower Liqueur 3/4 ounce grapefruit juice 1 ounce cranberry juice grapefruit twist or wedge, to garnish, optional In a cocktail shaker filled with ice, combine all ingredients. Shake well, and pour into a martini glass. Garnish with a grapefruit twist or wedge, if desired. BLT Market 50 Central Park South New York, NY 10019 212.521.6125

Anne Burrell's 'Secrets,' Plus Resto Reccs and Why Being a Girl Chef isn't a Big Deal
AUTHOR:
Sarah DiGregorio
DATE:
2008-06-25 11:54:00
POST:
 We asked Chef Anne Burrell of Centro Vinoteca about her new Food Network show, where she likes to eat, and about being a woman in the kitchen. "Secrets of a Restaurant Chef" premieres this Sunday, June 29th at 9:30am. Tell us about your new show, 'Secrets of a Restaurant Chef.' Every show is based around a menu. The show starts with me preparing the menu at Centro and then moves to the home kitchen, where I break it down and teach people the technique. It’s about how to successfully cook those restaurant dishes at home. So will you be focusing on rustic Italian, as you do at the restaurant? There’s some Italian stuff because that’s what I do, but there’s also a focus on standard cooking techniques like roasting, searing… What common misconception do you hope to correct, what do you think people will be surprised to learn? Well, I think people think ‘Oh, cooking in a restaurant, you have all this space, I can’t do those things in my little kitchen.’ But actually, restaurant kitchens are pretty cramped with a lot of people in them. You can do great food in a tiny kitchen. My premiere show is about how to make a great Bolognese sauce, and antipasto of poached egg with grilled asparagus. That shows people, ‘Wow you can poach eggs ahead, who knew?’ And we’ll do a roasted chicken with great mashed potatoes—people think roasted chicken is a big whoop, but actually, roasted chicken is pretty cinchy. What tricks do you show viewers to make it easy? Well, how to truss a chicken, and why to truss a chicken…how to do a jus, that’s an easy sauce that goes with the chicken that’s made in the same pot. Showing people that chicken doesn’t have to be dry, that it should have nice crispy skin. You lube it up with olive oil; flip it a couple times so that the top and bottom are crispy. Start it out on high heat, so you get the nice brown crisp skin, and then turn it down and cook it slowly so that the chicken stays juicy. Sounds like the kind of show people actually want from the Food Network, the kind of technique-focused show that the network seems to have been moving away from. Well, I hope people are interested, that’s why I wrote these kinds of menus, so that people will think ‘Oh wow, I think I could do that.’ Is there a dish or technique that people often think that it’s harder than it is? I do a show about searing fish—how to make a crispy skinned fish. People say, ‘I don’t know, I try to sear fish and it gets mushy and soggy and it falls apart, and the skin sticks to bottom of pan…’ I show how to sear wild striped bass, but you can use the technique with snapper or salmon or any fish. Do you have any tips for getting the most out of a restaurant experience? I go to work in a restaurant everyday, and I would say that when you go to a new restaurant, put yourself in the hands of the restaurant. People come in and ask, ‘Can you make me this?’ instead of ordering what the place does well. If you let the restaurant do what they do, you’ll enjoy it so much more. Ask the waiters what’s their favorite, they see it and serve it everyday. Or, ask them what’s most popular. The stuff that the servers like, that’s probably what the restaurant is best at. What should a home cook make for an impressive dinner party that’s still doable? Any braised dish—that’s dinner party-ish, it has a wow factor and is something that anyone can do. It’s a total do ahead, or even do yesterday type thing. It’s flavorful and hearty. People will be like ‘Wow, you made short ribs!’ You can serve a nice big wine with it, serve polenta with it and people love it. And you’ll have leftovers. Braising takes a little effort to get started but once it you have it going, you can leave it alone. And when people walk in, the house smells amazing. You’re the executive chef at Centro Vinoteca—do you think it’s harder for a woman to make it big in the kitchen? You know, I can’t comment because I don't know how it is to be a male chef, I only know how it is to be me. Being in the kitchen is a hard job for anybody, but if it’s your passion you don’t think of it as being hard. Even a year ago if you had said to me that I’d have my own show, I would have laughed. I’ve been lucky, but I’ve also worked hard; if you work hard you can bring about your own luck. A lot of people ask me about being a female chef versus being male chef…I don’t know, it’s just my job and I’d prefer to be thought of as a chef rather than a girl chef. I’m not like I walk around saying ‘I’m a woman, not a man!’ It is what it is. What’s happening with Gusto Ristorante? Are you going to be working there soon? Centro’s not even a year old, and I’m not ready not to go to work there everyday. I’m slated to start at Gusto, and eventually it’s going to happen. Right now, though I’m focusing on Centro and waiting to see how things unfold with the show. Is Iron Chef as stressful as it looks? It absolutely is, that hour never gets any longer, and if things go awry, as they sometimes do, the hour still doesn’t get any longer. I mean, it’s incredibly intense and an adrenalin rush, and I love doing it. I love working with Mario. Would you want to be an Iron Chef yourself? I would have to think about that, it’s a hard job. I like my role on the show for the time being. Besides your own restaurant, where do you like to eat out in the city? I’m a huge fan of Mario’s places, and not just because I work with him. He’s one of the top restaurateurs in the city for a reason. Babbo and Lupa are a few of my favorite places. And recently I ate for the first time at Momofuku Ssam Bar, and I was like, ‘I want to move in here!’ We had a ton of stuff, way too much food because I wanted to try everything—the pork buns, charred squid salad, hanger steak, kampachi with pickled strawberries and fried capers...I’m also a big fan of the burger at Daddy-o. I go after work; I try not to eat late at night but sometimes I can’t resist. I think it’s the tater tots that put it over the edge. What’s next for you? I’m hoping I’ll be filming more shows. I filmed six and now we wait to see, and hopefully there will be more. The premiere is this Sunday at 9:30 in the morning, right? Thank god for Tivo! I know, I Tivoed my own show the other day! Most people who work nights aren’t up at that time. If it weren’t for Tivo I’d probably miss my own premiere.

Every since most of the chefs started leaving the Foodnetwork I had been hoping for a show like this, I do not care male or female as long as they are a chef, and can teach me techniques used in restaurant cooking I can use at home, and how to make my dish look like it was cooked in a 5 star restaurant, I will support you to the end.

I sent this to Food Network re: Anne's premier, but I'll post here in case they don't forward it to her. Love, LOVE this show and Anne! What a fresh way to approach gourmet for the home cook - ME! I have been a fan of FN for years now and my cooking has vastly improved from watching Ina, Giada, Mario, Michael, and yes, Rachel too. Anne just takes the cake tho. We loved her body language and how she articulated. I have been trying to make bolognese for three years now and in 15 minutes she taught me how to do it. Now I want to go to Tuscany to learn how to cook. Until then I'll keep watching Anne. -Vanessa Van Dalsem, Weston Price Foundation Tucson Chapter

Wow... great show, real interesting personality, would love to spend a couple of hours in the kitchen with Anne! She keeps it simple, makes it real and truly makes it seem as if anyone can do it. It's great to see how a chef can work in a small space and use relatively common foods and cooking utensils to create top quality food (but there Was that food mill, and most of us don't have a place to store one of THOSE dudes!) My only criticism is the use of acronyms that have to be expanded out directly after, a bad habit someone else on FN has that many viewers can't stand... it isn't "cute" and if you HAVE TO spell it out anyway, might as well do it to begin with. Love how "real" Anne comes across as a person and a chef... and how she doesn't find it necessary to explain how and where she learned what she knows, because many/most of us couldn't afford the cost or time to gain this type of experience. I know that I, for one, appreciate her willingness to share her skills and expertise with us all. Larry

Okay, let me say that I just LOVE ANNE!!! Her spirit and attitude while in the kitchen (well at least on the show) just makes me want to run to NYC and beg to work for her (even though I would more than likely just be washing dishes). I have been a Food Network viewer for years and I have to admit that this seems like one of the first shows that is acutally instructional versus demonstrational (is that even a word??). Anne is definitely the breath of fresh air that TFN has been needing for quite a while. Thanks Food Network and a BIG OLD FAT THANKS TO YOU ANNE!!!! (I can't wait to go to NYC to come and taste your food).

Our Man Sietsema and the Exploding M-80 Baby Goat
AUTHOR:
Sarah DiGregorio
DATE:
2008-06-25 9:08:00
POST:
 Our Man Sietsema is at Scott Conant's Scarpetta this week, and he tells us that he's been following Conant's career closely ever since he first tasted Conant's baby goat in 2000 at City Eatery. He says that the goat exploded in his mouth like an M-80, causing the goat-hooked Our Man to limp after Conant ever since. Even though the goat is back in a in a different incarnation at Scarpetta—not roasted, but instead in a hash cooked with artichokes and potatoes—Our Man has filed a rave. He loves it all, from the bread basket to the agnolotti dal plin. He takes issue with only one dish, a pasta that doesn't quite work. Here's what he says about the agnolotti dal plin: A rave from Sietsema is hard to come by, so we'd suggest you get over to Scarpetta tout suite. These bulbous misshapen pouches contain a divine mix of veal, truffles, and cabbage so finely puréed that it would make excellent toothpaste—though you'd insist on swallowing it after brushing. If you want to freak yourself out with richness, I'd recommend the duck-and-foie-gras raviolis ($22), which resemble Revolutionary War tri-corner hats.

Sietsema revisits Landmarc
AUTHOR:
Sarah DiGregorio
DATE:
2008-06-24 16:29:00
POST:
Today another dispatch from Our Man Sietsema appeared in my inbox. This time, he's been reevaluating Landmarc in Tribeca, a place that he loved when it first opened, not the least for its affordable wine list. Is the wine still cheap? Does he still adore it? You'll have to read to find out. Quoth Sietsema: Hey Sarah -- Ever since I first reviewed Landmarc in Tribeca not long after its opening, I’ve been recommending the restaurant to people that wanted an upscale place to celebrate special events. I’ve been touting it for its bucolic location in Tribeca and pleasant brick-clad interior; for its menu that combines steaks and chops with more forward-looking dishes, and, especially, for its low markups on wine. As I noted in 2005, “good bottles are often the same price as mediocre bottles elsewhere.” As Landmarc nears its three-year anniversary, after it has spun off a Columbus Circle branch and the more down-market Ditch Plains (a sort of surfer hot dog bar) in the West Village, I wondered if the parent establishment had managed to maintain its excellence. A friend and I arrived in the middle of the tomato scare, a threat that the city’s useless Department of Health and Mental Hygiene could develop no program for preventing. (They’re effective only at promoting the sale of rubber gloves, as far as I can tell.) Seated upstairs with a view of the construction site across the street, we went right for a special of cucumber gazpacho which neatly solved the problem of how to deal with the raw tomato threat (skip ‘em!). The cold soup was perfect in every way, garlicky and tasting of the garden. It was also the most delicate shade of green, with a miniature skin-on dice of kirbies in the center. What qualifies it as gazpacho? The soup was thickened in the old-fashioned Andalusian way with a paste of bread crumbs, which created a texture that was unforgettable. The other dishes we sampled were just as good, including al dente asparagus spears thicker than most and nicely garnished with tarragon aioli and chopped egg (cryptically dubbed “asparagus mimosa”). The pasta of the day proved just as spectacular as it was on my earlier visits, in this case an orecchiette alla norcina, name-checking the Umbrian town of Norcia, which is famous for its pork products. The rich, cream-laced pasta was dotted with flavorful Italian sausage, and you’re not likely to find a better pasta in Tribeca. Finally, we had one of the steaks cooked Tuscan-style over the flaming hearth on the first floor. Watching the grill guy at work is the best reason I can think of for sitting in the downstairs barroom rather than upstairs or out front among the sidewalk tables. The strip steak was excellent – pink in the middle, almost crumbly in the way dry-aged beef should be, and blackened and smoky on the surface. But when I consulted the wine menu, I was a bit disappointed. There were few bottles under $40, and the markups seemed higher than they’d been before, though still a good deal by fancy restaurant standards. The bottles I was most interested in came from the Oregon’s Willamette Valley, which are just now receiving their due from wine critics. The Dobbes Family Vineyard Pinot Gris ($36) was light and spicy for a red, with only a little oak shading, and it proved the perfect complement to the meal. Most of the Italian and French wines, though, were too expensive for all but the wealthiest drinkers. Still, I’m going to keep recommending Landmarc, especially for the excellent food. --Robert

NY Best Markets: Kalustyan's
AUTHOR:
Sarah DiGregorio
DATE:
2008-06-24 11:11:00
POST:
As far as I know, Kalustyan's is the best market in Manhattan. (If you can think of another contender, write me!) Mr. Kalustyan opened the shop in 1944, selling Indian spices and groceries. Now it's owned by Marhaba International, and traffics in every South Asian or Middle Eastern grocery item you could possibly imagine, plus specialty foods from Europe, Asia and Latin America. Open the door, you're greeted by a pungent smell of many spices and the sight of glass jars stacked high, filled with all sorts of nuts, dried fruits and teas. Wander the aisles and find dried purple corn, nine different Thai chile pastes, rose petal jelly, Austrian pumpkin seed oil and fresh ginger cordial from the UK. The array of dried beans alone is staggering—a rainbow of daals, plus special bean varieties like Jacobs cattle beans, steuben yellow beans and red chori beans. Best buys: Handmade masala paratha: Find them in the refrigerated case at the cashier. There are lots of different kinds, including tasty methi (fenugreek) paratha, but I love the spicy, brick orange masala paratha best. Just heat it up in a dry skillet. (Kalustyan's brand $3.99) Black treacle from the UK is similar to blackstrap molasses. It's got a dark, caramel flavor and is made with unrefined sugar. Mix it with equal parts soy sauce for a quick glaze that is good on meaty fish, chicken or tofu. (Lyle's $7.99) Mymouné rose syrup from Lebanon is made from just rose petals, sugar and lemon juice. You can add just a spoonful or so to simple baked goods, like lemon pound cake, or mix a drop or two into Champagne or a gin and tonic for a floral aroma. (Mymouné $7.99) Rogelio Bueno mole concentrate is the best jarred mole available, with a complex, nutty flavor (I did a comprehensive taste test when I was at Chile Pepper magazine). Unlike homemade mole, it's very easty to prepare: You just mix the paste with water, salt and sugar to taste, and simmer some chicken or pork in the resulting gravy. Kalustyan's stocks the dark red mole (my favorite) green mole and adobo sauce. (Rogelio Bueno moles $4.99) Dende (palm) oil has a distinctive orange color and is associated with cooking from the Brazilian state of Bahia. It's often used in seafood stews—make a basic shrimp stew with plenty of garlic, tomato sauce, chiles and coconut milk and then add a few spoonfuls of dende oil to finish the dish. (Pirata $9.99) Naga jolokia is the hottest chile in the world, recently cultivated in India, and very hard to find. Kalustyan's stocks the whole chiles, dried. I don't actually know what to do with these, but I bought a bag, and will let you know what happens! (Kalustyan's $8.99) Also in the dried chile section, you can find Indian stuffed chiles, which are delicious. They're dried peppers stuffed with fenugreek, turmeric and salt. Fry them in a little oil and eat them as a snack. (Kalustyan's $2.99) In the refrigerator: fresh curry leaves. There is no substitute for curry leaves (they have nothing to do with curry powder) and fresh ones are hard to find. Here's a recipe from the Indian state of Maharashtra (where Bombay is). My in-laws are Marathi and make this dish often. Batata Bhaji Yield: 2 servings 2 large baking potatoes 1/4 cup canola oil 1 tablespoon black mustard seeds 1 tablespoon turmeric 6 fresh curry leaves, roughly torn 1 green chile, sliced 1 teaspoon cumin seed salt cilantro, to taste, for serving Bring a pot of water to a boil, and quickly blanch the potatoes until slightly softened but still firm in the middle. Drain, peel, dice, and set aside. In a large skillet over medium-high heat, warm the oil. Add the mustard seeds, and let them sizzle for about 30 seconds. When the mustard seeds become fragrant and pop, add in the turmeric, curry leaves, chile, cumin and a generous pinch of salt. Cook the spices, stirring so that they don't burn, for about 1 minute. Add the potatoes, and stir well to combine. Lower the heat, and cook until potatoes are tender. Taste for salt, adding more if necessary, and serve with cilantro scattered on top. In the prepared foods refrigerator: spiced chickpea salad, eggplant salad and sautéed spinach with "snobar" (which turn out to be pinenuts), among other to-go treats. (Kalustyan's $3.50 and up) 123 Lexington Ave New York, NY 10016 212-685-3451 Store Hours: Mon - Sat 10am-8pm Sun/Holiday 11am-7pm

Hi Amol, Thanks for reading. Unfortunately, I don't know of a Maharashtrian restaurant. I wish I did! I don't think one exists in New York. But you can get things like batata wada and wada pav at Sukhadia's (17 West 45th Street, between 5th and 6th Avenue, Phone : 212 395-7300). If anyone out there knows of a place to get more Maharashtrian dishes, please let us know, and I'll write about them here. Sarah

Who Needs a $500 Blender?

 Obviously, no one needs a $500 blender. But no one needs fleur de sel or dinner at Per Se or a thousand-dollar suit or a Ferarri either. The Vita-Mix 5200 retails for $450. It's one of those products that was designed for a commerical kitchen which are now popular with obsessive homecooks. But not many people are in the market for a blender that costs more than a plane ticket. But let's just say you're having a midlife crisis and you prefer cooking to messing around with pretty girls or to speeding. Is the Vita-Mix worth it, by any standard? If you're a kitchen-gadget-lover, a person who'd like a juicer, a food processor and a blender as powerful as a jet engine all in one, than it probably is worth saving your pennies for. There's some inscrutable info in the manual about the blades being so powerful that they break down cell walls in fruits and veggies. All I know is that I stuck a bunch of carrots and ginger in there, turned it on, and ended up with carrot-ginger juice (see before and after, above). It's also so powerful that it heats up soup (hopefully soup that you wanted puréed). Put your cream-of-whatever in there, whirr it up, and it's soon piping hot. When making frozen margaritas, the Vita-Mix got a bit stuck on the gnarly, clumpy bodega ice, but a poke with its plastic wand sorted that out. If the notion of the blender equivilent of a Ferrari appeals, this is your guy. The blades spin at 250 mph, so be prepared--the first time I turned it on, the roar of the blades made me duck for cover. And here's a summery, spicy gazpacho to make in your blender, whether it cost $5 or $500. Four Chile Gazpacho Yield: 6 servings 2 pasilla chiles 2 ancho chiles 2 guajillo chiles 2 seedless cucumbers, divided, 1 diced, 1 roughly chopped 1 small red onion, 1/2 diced, 1/2 set aside 1 (28-ounce) can chopped tomatoes 1 carrot, peeled and chopped 4 cloves garlic 3 roasted red bell peppers 1 red jalapeño, halved 1 cup 2% Greek yogurt juice of 2 limes salt and freshly ground pepper Greek yogurt, for serving diced avocado, for serving In a bowl, combine pasilla, ancho and guajillo chiles. Cover with hot water, and set aside to soften. In a serving bowl, combine diced cucumber and diced red onion. In the blender base combine roughly chopped cucumber, 1/2 red onion, tomatoes, carrot, garlic, roasted red bell peppers and jalapeño. Blend on high until smooth. Remove dried chiles from hot water, discarding water. Stem chiles, roughly chop, and add into the blender base. Blend on high until puréed. Scoop in yogurt, lime juice and salt and pepper, to taste. Blend briefly until incorporated. Scrape into serving bowl to combine with diced cucumber and red onion, and refrigerate until chilled. Serve topped with yogurt and diced avocado.

My wife and I invested in the blender from a live demonstration at a Costco. It was quite expensive I think $400 or $450 or so. We find out it's the same appliance that Tropical Smoothies store use. We've been using it religiously and it blends and grinds up seeds and skins and makes awesome home smoothie. It has the mixer that you can push thing down in that get stuck on walls of the blender. There's another blender also expensive that didn't have that "pusher" part. It's very well worth it if you have the money to spend.

POST:
Recipe Improv: A new feature in which we throw out random ingredients to a well-known chef and ask him or her to come up with a recipe incorporating all those ingredients that's doable for a home cook. Up first! Chef Harold Moore, chef/owner of Commerce, who has worked under Daniel Boulud and Jean-George Vongerichten. His ingredients: Nectarines, olives and pine nuts And here's what he came up with. If any of you have a trio of ingredients that you'd like to see a chef tinker with, comment or shoot me an email. Recipe improv will be played regularly. Fennel Salad with Pine Nut Citrus Vinaigrette Serves 2 For the dressing: 1/4 cup pine nuts, toasted and crushed (Reserve 1 tablespoon uncrushed) 1 tablespoon nectarine juice 1 teaspoon lime juice 1 teaspoon orange juice 1/2 cup olive oil 1 tablespoon walnut oil, optional For the salad: 1 large fennel bulb, thinly sliced 1 large nectarine, segmented 1/8 cup Kalamata olives, pitted and sliced Make the dressing: Crush the toasted pine nuts while they are still hot, remembering to reserve 1 tablespoon uncrushed nuts on the side. In a bowl, combine the citrus juices with the crushed pine nuts. When the crushed nuts have cooled in the juice, whisk the olive and walnut oils into the citrus juice-pine nut mixture to make a vinaigrette. Toss the salad ingredients in the dressing, adding salt and crushed pepper to taste. Top with the dry pine nuts. Serve with grilled sardines, if desired.

POST:
The second installment of "What's for Dinner?" a new feature in which we interview random New Yorkers about their food lives, including where they like to eat in the city, their best and worst food memories and what's for dinner. Name: Nassar Hasar Age: He'd prefer not to say Occupation: Street cart owner and cook Location: At his cart, on Astor Place (at Lafayette) south side of the street What's your best food memory? The foods I ate in Egypt: chicken gyro, falafel, baba ganoush, eggplant, fried potatoes... Did you cook all that for yourself or did your family also cook? No, only me, I ate that at home. How did you learn to cook? My brother taught me. When did you come to the US? In 1999. Do you miss Egypt and Egyptian food? Yes, everyone misses their country. I come here for the work, that's it. Is there anyplace in New York that serves good Egyptian food? In Queens, around 28th Street and Astoria Boulevard, there are a lot of Arabic restaurants. I like Sabry's. What do you get there? Anything, different Arabic foods, they have any fish you like. I sometimes get fish, sometimes kabobs. What's for dinner tonight? Tonight? [laughs] I don't know. Last night I had bread, salad and chicken. Pita bread, salad with tomato, lettuce, little stuff. The chicken, I make it like curry. I put black pepper, salt, vinegar and garlic.

Tasting New Beers from Shmaltz Brewing Company
AUTHOR:
Sarah DiGregorio
DATE:
2008-06-18 14:50:00
POST:
Just in time to feed my summer obsession with Coney Island, Shmaltz Brewing company has rolled out several new Coney Island lagers, with freak show themes. I like both Albino Python (a spiced white lager) and Sword Swallower (a classic, bitter, hopped up lager) better than the original Coney Island Lager, which I think is tasty but a little boring. The labels are by Brooklyn-based tattoo artist Dave Wallin. If I were a better photographer, I would have done them justice. You can taste these new beers, as well as get sneak previews of Human Blockhead and Freaktoberfest (both of which are seasonal and not technically available now) this Thursday, June 19th at Blind Tiger, starting at 6pm. There will also be hot dogs and cotton candy, naturally. Some of the proceeds from this line go to Coney Island USA, a non-profit that's trying to save the lovely freakishness of Coney Island. The Tasting: Coney Island Sword Swallower (Steel Hop Lager, 6.8% alc) Golden and clear in color, with a mild aroma, but a very big, bitter hoppy taste that goes on forever. Strong, but nicely balanced—it's not so bitter that you can hardly drink a pint, like some strongly hopped beers are. Coney Island Albino Python (White Lager, 6% alc) I loved this one, although you have to be a fan of beer brewed with spices to like it. It's cloudy and light in color, and tastes of aromatic orange peel and cloves. Floral and summery.

Sietsema on Crif Dogs' Secret 
AUTHOR:
Sarah DiGregorio
DATE:
2008-06-18 13:59:00
POST:
As Our Man Sietsema and I continue to update the dining listings, we periodically re-visit restaurants we haven't been to for a while. Since the dining listings are, by necessity, short and sweet, it's fun to get the whole story from Our Man on the places he's re-evaluating. Today: Crif Dogs! And Our Man has discovered their secret. Hey Sarah: Two of my favorite chefs in town are Wylie Dufresne (WD-50) and David Chang (the Momofuku empire), so when I heard that each had created his own weenie for Crif Dogs, I ran over there right away to find out how they were garnished. Trouble was, no one in Crif Dogs knew what the hell I was talking about when I dropped in around midday. A couple weeks later, I visited again, only to have the countergal tell me, “Oh, those. We don’t know how to make them. You’ll have to drop by the bar some evening.” She was referring to the Crif Dogs bar next door, which had apparently become a hang for downtown chefs like Chang and Dufresne. A friend and I scoured the façade of the bar, but could detect nothing that resembled a door, but, once inside the hot dog merchant, we noted the odd presence of a phone booth in one corner. Though I go regularly to Crif Dogs for the “spicy redneck” (a deep fried dog swaddled in bacon and topped with chili, jalapenos, and coleslaw), I’d never notice the phone booth before. When you pick up the receiver, the hostess answers and buzzes you in through a secret swinging panel in the booth, like one of those damn spy bars popular in the previous century. Once inside, you’ll discover a swanky subterranean room with a long bar and a few tables, mounted animal trophies, and some bartenders who take their mixology seriously. Funny that a hot dog stand should spawn a swanky bar, we thought. Along with some beers, we ordered the Chang and the Dufresne, priced at $5 each. After a bit of a wait, they were passed through a tiny metal door at the back of the bar by a pair of disembodied hands, very Addams Family. Both were memorably tasty. The Chang model, like the spicy redneck, began with a frank that had a piece of bacon pinned around it, like a cave girl modeling a skimpy animal skin. The dog was further dressed with kim chi and some species of upscale ketchup, sweet and slightly spicy. The Dufresne features the same dog (sans bacon) with freeze-dried onions, shredded Romaine, and one of Wylie’s science chef flourishes, fried mayonnaise, which had the texture of shaving cream on the night we tried it, which may have been a mis-execution of the chef’s original intent. It was good nonetheless. In fact, the dogs were so good, we wished you could score them without all the rigmarole of phone booth, cocktail lounge, and waiter service. Please, Crif Dogs, teach the folks next door how to make these for your more plebian patrons. --Robert

Our Man Sietsema Travels to Redang Island
AUTHOR:
Sarah DiGregorio
DATE:
2008-06-18 8:16:00
POST:
 This week, Our Man discovers a Malaysian restaurant called Redang Island in Bath Beach, Brooklyn, and in the process of reviewing it tells us almost everything we could ever want to know about the real Redang Island, including that it's one of the only places in Malaysia to get a drink. No better geography, history or culture lesson than Our Man's columns. As for the restaurant, Our Man really likes it. Here's what he has to say about the Hainanese chicken (a dish that I sampled in Singapore, and speaking as a non-chicken lover, this is the best way to eat chicken in the world.) He also likes the rojak, another classic. There's an astonishingly good Hainanese chicken ($7.50 for a half-bird)—cold, poached poultry deposited in a rich soy sauce, decorated with fronds of cilantro and slivers of green onion. The recipe is associated with Hainan Island, China's southernmost province, and if cold chicken doesn't sound like your kind of thing, think again, because the sliced bird is spectacular, rubbery skin and all. To enjoy it properly, order a bowl of "chicken rice" ($1.50) cooked in the poaching broth. Redang Island does commendable versions of the strange, sweet salads that Malaysian cuisine is famous for, including Indian rojak ($6.95)—a wild lettuce-less ride of jicama, tofu, bean sprouts, shredded jellyfish nearly indistinguishable from the sprouts, and homemade crackers embedded with shrimp, dribbled with dark palm syrup.

I called Andrea Nguyen, the Vietnamese cooking expert and cookbook author, to find out what she thinks are the hallmarks of a great banh mi, and she had some very interesting things to say, not only about what makes a great sandwich, but also about how she's tired of hearing it called a product of French colonialism. It was Vietnamese cooks who came up with the sandwich, and they already had a long history of making charcuterie and lunch meats—that wasn't brought by the French. Vietnamese cooks even re-made the baguette, mixing in rice flour because it was cheaper and more familiar. (Does anyone know if you can get a rice flour baguette at any of the banh mi places in the city? I didn't find any on my Brooklyn travels.) No matter how the sandwich was born, banh mi are inarguably delicious—eat plenty of them this summer.

Bruno's Replaced by New York Hot Dog and Coffee (From Korea) 
AUTHOR:
Sarah DiGregorio

POST:
 Our Man Sietsema just wrote us to say that as he was walking down Bleeker Street this morning, he noticed a banner over the old Bruno's pastry shop. It seems that the space will soon be New York Hot Dog and Coffee, a hot dog, smoothie and coffee franchise from Korea. A look at the company's website reveals a hot dog selection that is unique to say the least. The bulgogi hot dog (hot dog topped with grilled marinated beef) looks awesome, as does the curry sauced dog. The New York Red Hot Dog is a cypher, seemingly slathered with some kind of ketchupy red sauce, and likewise, I can't figure out what the "Ave Chilij" dog might be. The cheese dog, with its thick coating of yellow goo, terrifies. Other New York classics by way of Korea include "salad buns" which seem to be egg salad and chicken salad heros; bagels with cream cheese and (savvy!) trendy-now Belgian waffles topped with ice cream. The coffee portion of the menu is mostly comprised of those coffee drinks that come topped with a mountain of whipped cream and drizzled with chocolate sauce. Quoth Our Man Sietsema:  Weird how, in the tanking economy, countries with stronger currencies are locating in New York for the purpose of selling our own products—or strange facsimiles thereof—back to us. I can't wait to try the hot dogs, at least, but am skeptical about the espresso.

Oh Snap: Ariane Daugin Talks Back to Avella
AUTHOR:
Sarah DiGregorio
DATE:
2008-06-16 12:16:00
POST:
Gothamist has an interview with Ariane Daugin of D'Artagnan, the US's biggest foie gras producer. She's addressing City Councilmember Avella's recent resolution in support of a NY state senate bill to ban force feeding. (Read our interview with Avella here.) She makes a few valid points, one of which is that if the bill banning foie gras production is passed, 500 upstate jobs will be lost. But here's where things get really good: Like we said, oh snap. Avella is trying to draw support for an old bill, and let's be honest, get some attention for his mayoral campaign. Suddenly, we are all talking about him. But he is sadly misinformed-and is misleading the public. It seems obvious, but bears mentioning: ducks aren't built the same as humans. He keeps talking about the birds' "mouths" being hurt by the feeding tube; he is basically anthropomorphizing. Birds have beaks, not mouths, and the tube does not hurt them. When a mother bird wants to show her love for her baby bird, she puts her beak down as far as possible into her baby's neck (esophagus) and then pukes in it -- this is how she feeds it. The scientific facts about duck anatomy are available, so I won't belabor the point. What I'd like to say to Avella is, "go visit a good farm and then we can talk -- don't listen to those whose agenda is to convert the world to vegetarianism; get the facts.

I cannot believe a person running for Mayor of New York could be so irresponsible as to promote a special interest agenda without researching the subject first. I wouldn't vote for Avella for dogcather after this. I guess I am pretty naive about politicians, but this really bugs me. I visited Hudson Valley Foie Gras while attending a Culinary Institute of America continuing education program earlier this year. I toured the farm and what I saw was totally not what is presented by Avella and the animal rights groups. I watched the force feeding, toured the whole place and saw a nice operation with well cared for animals.

Wow, I'm truly shocked that someone who works for "the US's biggest foie gras producer" would believe the production process to be uncruel. I'm additionally shocked that someone training to be a chef in "a Culinary Institute of America continuing education program" would not approve of a ban on foie gras. (sarcasm) Of course the production process is painful and unnecessarily cruel. Although I guess I could be wrong, I mean obviously the tours provided by the farm visited by the previous commenter was totally impartial, since the foie gras companies don't have any vested interest in making the process look uncruel.

Chihiro, a ten year old girl, and her parents accidentally wander into a spirit world ruled by a witch; Chihiro's parents gorge themselves on piles of enchanted food that turn them into pigs, forcing the little girl to stay in the spirit world and try to save her parents. My favorite part is Chihiro's encounter with the Radish Spirit, a giant, taciturn daikon monster. Seriously, amazing. And! Upon Googling the Radish Spirit, I discover that he has entered the 21st Century, with a MySpace page , in which he says that he's interested in meeting "Bears, Cubs, Chubs, more Radish Spirits, Chasers, Japs, Farmers, booking agents..."

NY Best Markets: Gold City 
AUTHOR:

POST:
 Gold City is absolutely one of my favorite shops in the city—as sprawling as a suburban Stop and Shop (and much more interesting). It's like Willy Wonka's factory for East Asian ingredients. If you need something—like, oh, I don't know, bull's penis—that you can't find anywhere else, this is the place to go. It's also highly entertaining to just wander around, finding all sorts of products you may never have seen before, as well as home cooking basics like bok choy, long beans and a big selection of fish for great prices. The produce, meat and fish sections are all quite large and, luckily, do a high turnover, so it's all pretty fresh. In the meat section alone you can find everything from pork shoulder and chicken liver to oxtail and goat, duck wings and pig snouts, and yes, bull penis. Best Buys: Lotus root looks like something from outer space, tubular with intricate hollows running through it. Slice it crosswise, and you've got very pretty little rounds with what looks like a lotus flower cut out of it. Pat the slices dry and fry them in hot oil until golden and crisp. Then they only need a sprinkle of salt to be delicious. ($1.19 per pound) The baby bok choy here is beautiful, too. You all know what to do with that, right? Just treat it like any other green. I like it stir fried with ginger and garlic. ($1.29 per pound) Black silkie chicken, found in the meat section's refrigerator case, has black skin, black bones and beige-ish meat. Don't be intimidated, just treat it like any other chicken. Chinese cooks love silkies for their deep, intense flavor, which makes very assertive chicken soups (add ginger and ginseng). It's also good in a spicy curry sauce, in which its strongly flavored meat can stand up to the sauce. ($5.30 per pound) Pork jerky, found in one of the many snack food aisles, is sweet and spicy and possibly as addictive as crack. (Formosa brand; $5.58) Japanese fruit gummy candies are also in one of the snack aisles. They come in all sorts of good flavors like melon, litchi and muscat grape, and they aren't too sweet and have a really satisfying chew. (Kasugai Seika Co. brand) It's fun to have the makings of a dim sum lunch in your fridge. In the refrigerated section you can find fresh roast pork rolls to steam at home, and in the frozen section there's all sorts of gyoza and shumai. (Pork buns: Mommy's Gourmet brand $2.28; JFC brand shumai filled with shrimp or pork; $2.98) The best deal, though, is the fresh tofu, for 30 cents a block. Gold City 4631 Kissena Blvd Flushing, NY 11355 (718) 762-7688 Subway: 7 train to Main Street/Flushing Below, goodies like dried fish, fresh and frozen dumplings and fresh tofu and seaweed:

Our Man Sietsema was nice enough to call my attention to a very interesting article up right now on Gourmet's website. In it, Laura Shapiro wonders why so few women chefs make it to the tippity top of the restaurant world in New York. And it's true that while you can think of several women chefs—Anito Lo, Gabrielle Hamilton—they haven't broken into that sphere with, say, Eric Ripert and Mario Batali. It's worth a read, certainly. It's a good reminder that despite Stephanie's Top Chef win last night, womens' place in the kitchen is far from secure.

It sounds like something out of a stoner movie: "What if we took a soft pretzel, soaked it in buffalo sauce, and poured melted cheese over the top?" But no, this culinary masterpiece was actually dreamed up by the creative folks at the Illinois Gateway Grizzlies concession stand (where you can also get a deep-fried hotdog stuffed into a twinkee, or Super Pierogies: pierogies topped with chilli and cheese). The Grizzlies are part of the baseball frontier league, whatever that is. (via Deadspin)

Fork in the Road and the Wholesale Farmers' Market
AUTHOR:
Sarah DiGregorio
DATE:
2008-06-11 8:56:00
POST:
 This week, my column profiles the New York wholesale farmers' market. Most people, including chefs who are interested in such things, don't know it exists. It does, but it's a shadow of its former self. Back before farmers' markets were cool, around the 1950's, there were hundreds of farmers who sold their wares at wholesale quantity and prices from the Bronx Terminal Market. But over the years their numbers have dwindled, and since the Bronx Terminal Market is now being turned into a mall (where you'll be able to eat at Applebee's!) the farmers are essentially homeless, renting out space in the Fulton Fish Market parking lot. Basically, the reason this matters is because individual consumers are never going to change the way food is produced and distributed in this country. You and I feeling good about ourselves for shopping at the farmers' markets only goes so far. If you really want to support local farmers, there has to be a way for supermarkets and restaurants to buy their wares, and those businesses need a wholesale source—large quantities at reduced rates. Guess who wanted to provide the wholesale farmers' market with a nice building and some organization and infrastructure (which would attract more farmers to sell and buyers to buy)? Gov. Spitzer! Guess where that went? Now the farmers are waiting for various state and city agencies to decide where and how to create a dedicated space for the market. On a side note, a co-worker sent me this essay from the Freakonomics blog, giving a counter-argument against the notion of locovorism.

 This week, Our Man is thrilled by Fiore's pastas, not the least because it reminds him of lingerie. Reasonable prices plus those sexy pastas and a smart, affordable wine list top the reasons Our Man likes Fiore. Even better are the braised baby squid, which Our Man says are "ecstacy." The secondi, or main courses, do not meet with such approval, leading Our Man to suggest sticking to the antipasti, primi, and sides. Lasagne Bolognese is the authentic article, a few sheets of wobbly noodle sprawled across the plate, pleasantly mired in a sauce mixing tomato, cheese, and hunks of ground meat, flamed to crustiness under the salamander. Even better are the homemade spinach-and-cheese raviolis, with a wrapper rolled so thin and delicate that it might be mistaken for lingerie.

Foie News: Councilman Avella Weighs In
AUTHOR:
Sarah DiGregorio
DATE:
2008-06-10 17:27:00
POST:
A bill introduced to the NY State Senate last year is getting some support from Councilmember Tony Avella tomorrow. At 1pm, Avella will be on the steps of the City Hall to announce that he's introducing a resolution in support of the bill, which would ban the practice of force-feeding, which is employed to fatten the livers of ducks and geese. Basically, the resolution has no legislative teeth—it's meant to be nudge (or a jab) to the senators in Albany, encouraging them move the bill forward. I gave Councilmember Avella a call to talk to him about the resolution. In particular, I was curious to know why this issue should get any traction in New York—there are only 2 foie gras farms in New York, while there are scores more factory farms in the state and the nation, where conditions are arguably far crueler than those at foie gras farms. How did this resolution come about, and what does it say? A couple years ago, a Columbia student, who is actually going to be at the press conference, brought the issue to my attention. He knew I had been active in animal rights issues, and he called one day, made an appointment, and came in with a video depicting this force feeding. The more research I did, the more I thought he was right. So this resolution is to support the legislation that’s pending in the State Senate to ban force-feeding. There are two farms in New York state, I believe, that do this. They open the birds’ mouths forcefully, and they forcibly blow huge amounts of feed into the animal to artificially enlarge the liver. And people should understand, this isn’t a full ban, but to prohibit this inhumane treatment. Let the animal feed normally, and end this awful practice of forcing food down the throat by the metal tube. It’s disgraceful, when you see these videos taken under cover…You don’t have to be someone involved in animal rights to say that this isn’t right. Animal cruelty is inappropriate and action should be taken. What is the status of the bill in the Senate? It’s not moving, and that’s what I hope to change by introducing this resolution. I hope to send a message to Albany, saying they should take action. We’re hoping that this will start a movement in the city; people need to be educated about this practice. Why do you think the bill in the Senate hasn’t moved forward? I think there’s a sense of, “Oh, they’re trying to ban some sort of food…” But that’s not true; we’re trying to ban the inhumane practice of force-feeding. I heard about a farmer in Spain who is producing foie gras without force-feeding—so you’d be okay with that? That’s fine. A critic might say that foie gras production gets a lot of attention, but that other factory farming practices are actually much crueler and far more widespread. How do you respond? Those issues haven’t been brought to my attention yet and my door is always open. When people bring me an issue, I have an open mind and if I agree, I’ll help them. Part of being an elected official is listening, and if something is important to the people of New York, and I agree, I’ll do something about it.

I find it interesting that one of the posts compared banning the eating of ice cream in the streets to torturing animals. The production of foie gras is horribly cruel. Shoving a metal pipe down a bird's throat several times a day and stuffing his stomach with enormous amounts of food is a sickening and shameful practice. I've seen the films, and pictures of birds who had died suffocating on their own vomit. Because of the swelling of their organs and the fact that these organs press on their lungs and make it difficult for them to breath, they are in constant pain. The industry tries to say that the birds don't suffer, but you can go on the Internet to a site like YouTube, and view a video of birds being force fed, then see if you think that there's nothing wrong with it. Imagine if someone was doing this to you.

Any public official taking a humane stand against animal abuse should be applauded. To produce foie gras, geese and ducks are force-fed unnatural amounts of grain by shoving pipes down their throats, which can cause painful lacerations and even organ rupture. More and more restaurants are removing this shameful product from their menus. And legislation in the US and abroad has banned the sale and production of foie gras. New York should do the right thing and follow this humane lead.

As a society, we need to be able to stand up for all wrongs and not compare one wrong to another. Who deserves more attention - Gays, African Americans, Latinos, Disabled, Children, Elderly, Women, Native Americans? THEY ALL DO! Each human population and every aniaml population has its own issues that are similar and unique and they all merit attention. The oversimplified comparison/contrast by some people on this blog only serves to form competition. The pro foie gras people on this site - have you so little empathy that you cannot spare a little for gentle, defenseless animals without a voice. While foie gras may not be an everyday food for the majority of people, it is an actively cruel and grostesque process of making a bird so sick it can barely stand up and breathe so allowing it to go on simply for its' taste is cruel and unethical. Geese are highly social and loyal birds that fly next to injured birds singing them songs of encouragement so they can garner the strength to keep flying, they are monogamous, and are so revered for their community rituals that videos are made for teambuidling purposes using geese as examples to aspire to. As for the pain they experience, the birds in nature do gorge themselves prior to migrating, but in factory foie gras farms, THEY DO NOT DETERMINE AND SELF REGULATE HOW MUCH FOOD TO INGEST AND THEY DO NOT MIGRATE!!!! We just keep overfeeding them until they drop! Birds stop long before the point of respiratory distress so they are able to fly! Autopsies of birds used for foie gras show massive ruptures in their trachea, esophagus, with livers so overly enlarged that the pressure against their lungs creates massive respiratory distress and illness. This is hardly a natural and painless pre-migration health status that foier gras proponents like to refer to order to rationalize their greed. Given the number of workers in foie gras farms and the number of birds who must be force fed 3 times a day, there is no possibility for each worker to be gentle with each and every bird! All factory farming is cruel and each sick process of treating animals as "products" on a conveyer belt needs urgent attention. As a vegetarian, I want no part of eating any sentient being. For those who insist on eating animals, WE CAN DO BETTER AND RAISE ANIMALS FOR FOOD IN MORE HUMANE CONDITIONS! Europe and other countries are far more advanced in this area and we need to follow their lead. Foie gras is banned in 12 countries and even the Pope has declared it inhumane.

Furthermore! Malava will be available at New York Whole Foods in July. So there you have it, the world's first anti energy drink feud. I'm feeling sleepy already.

So we asked Ruth Reichl, editor in chief of Gourmet, and executive producer of Diary of a Foodie, about her favorite fast food in New York, around the world, and at home.

I think you kind of have to be a New Yorker to like the papaya drink, but I even like that. I love the crispness of the bun with the hot dog; I just think it’s in perfect proportion. I take it with onion sauce and mustard. I can eat a ridiculous number of them. There are lots of places around my office in Times Square, so there’s a halal curried chicken cart at 43rd Street and 6th Avenue. I get white rice, the curried chicken with vegetables and extra red sauce, no white sauce. There’s also a little Indian cab driver steam table place called Minar [138 W.46th St]. I like their dosa—there’s a really hot one that I like. Before they fill it with potatoes, they put a lot of red peppers inside. And I wouldn’t exactly call it fast food, but I love Momofuku Ssam Bar. I would eat there every meal if I could. I can’t resist the pork buns, and in summer, the corn with bacon and miso butter. He does this thing with rice sticks and pork that’s great and I love the whipped tofu with uni. And I love the ssam; I really like everything there. It’s like once you’ve had the greatest hits you never have room for anything new. At Grand Sichuan—you know, they have tons of them all over the city—they have this dish of chile peppers with fermented black beans that I am completely addicted to. It’s just jalapeños sautéed with fermented black beans and garlic, and you eat it over rice. It’s listed under Mao’s favorite foods on the menu. It’s completely addictive and wonderful. But, you know, I just love this kind of eating. What do you love about it? If you live a reservation life, it’s really nice to just go eat when you want, when you’re hungry. And a lot of these places we’re talking about are umami-blessed—the flavors are just really intense. I really do love eating at those food carts. There’s something so wonderful about walking by and having the aroma capture you. And people have this thing about “Oh my god are they sanitary?” You know, these cooks are standing out in front of the same building for years. The one I told you about has been in the same spot since I was working at the New York Times. I don’t think they’re poisoning people! And these are real people cooking food for you, from their hands to yours. It’s the same thing with sushi—you’re sitting there and taking it from their hands. And what about fast food worldwide, any places that come to mind? Well, this is my ideal, and I don’t know why no one is doing this in New York: In Palermo, you can get the single most perfect tuna sandwich on face of Earth. The guy has fresh rolls and cans of tuna packed in oil and he drizzles oil on the bread then he puts tuna on with fresh tomatoes and lettuce. This incredible old man makes it and gives it to you. It is so incredibly delicious, you can’t believe it. The only thing you can do after you eat one is to eat another. And I love that tripe cart in Florence that we have on the show. Singapore has some of the best fast food on the face of the earth. At the Oxford Circus hawker center, there’s a guy who makes something called carrot cake (they call daikon "carrot"). He sautés it with lots of other stuff, and makes a cake out of it that’s completely wonderful. All the food at the Oxford hawker center is great. And in the Bangkok market there are people who sell black sticky rice with mango and coconut, which is so wonderful. The colors of the black rice and the mango is so beautiful. It’s the perfect dessert. What are the best ingredients for fast food at home? Well, I always have a refrigerator filled with all kinds of Chinese and Thai chile paste and garlic and fermented black bean paste and oyster sauce. And I always have rice noodles, and some ground frozen pork in freezer. In 10 minutes you can put together a very satisfying Asian noodle thing with those ingredients. Or, vegetables sautéed with oyster sauce, that’s an instant delicious meal. I also always have frozen homemade chicken stock, eggs and Parmesan cheese, and then you’ve got instant stracciatella. You know, in a pinch there’s nothing better than Parmesan cheese. Noodles, butter, Parmesan. And eggs, as long as you have an egg, you have dinner.

POST:
New York is not the mecca of Cuban food it once was, but roast-pig lovers can take heart, at least this month. Every Saturday in June, Solace chef David Regueiro, who is of Cuban descent, will be doing an outdoor roast of a 40-pound piggy. At $27, it's more pricey that the Cuban lunch counters of old, but it might be worth it; you can devour the porcine goodness outside in the restaurant's garden. From the press release: The pig will be cooked in a specially-made box over charcoals and palm leaves. It will boast a sauce made with the drippings combined with garlic, sherry vinegar and salt.

What's for Dinner?
AUTHOR:
Sarah DiGregorio

POST:
Today, I'm launching a series called "What's for Dinner?" I'll stop and talk to random New Yorkers on the street about their best and worst food memories, where they like to eat in New York, and what's for dinner that night. Who: Shannon Rhinehardt Age: 68 Occupation: Retired Where: Waiting for the bus in Astor Place What's your best food memory? For the last five years, I've been traveling in Italy. And you know, they don't use a whole lot of sauce on their cuisine. It's just the ingredients and the seasoning. They can walk out and get olives, pick basil and use what they have to mix something up. One of the best things was the salad they make with day-old bread. A lot of the time, you'd prepare something for which you already have the ingredients around. Maybe you have some tomatoes that aren't perfect, but they'll suffice, you have the bread from yesterday...that's the best. And what's the worst meal you've ever had? An in-house catered meal at a reception at my church. It was cold. Do you have a favorite restaurant in New York? No, because at this time there are too many! But I'm in the East Village, and I recently discovered this tiny restaurant called 25-something, it's on Avenue B between 10th and 11th. I don't know what you call this kind of cooking, but it serves steaks and chops, and there's usually a special. People want more for their money these days, not a tiny, beautiful creation. What's for dinner tonight? I'm going Caribbean on you! I've got some salted fish, called bacalao, and I'm turning it into a big salad with red onions and peppers, okra, green peas and diced potatoes. Once you get the salt out of the fish, you stir fry it in olive oil until the fish becomes almost like angel hair. You sauté all the ingredients separately, then you incorporate them. You could use any leftovers you have. I love those vegetables with the fish. That sounds amazing! I wish I was having dinner at your house! God has spared me to enjoy these things, and hopefully I will continue to enjoy them.

NY Best Markets: Jubilat Provisions
AUTHOR:
Sarah DiGregorio
DATE:

POST:
 The Brooklyn neighborhood now dubbed "South Slope" by realtors was once a Polish and Eastern European enclave. Jubilat Provisions has been around for almost 20 years; it's a tiny Polish market stocked with all sorts of pickles, beets in many incarnations, and tons of homemade smoked meats. Best Buys: The most compelling reason to stop by Jubilat is to stock up on those smoky hunks of pig: Bacon, ham, kielbasa, loin, and more, all of it home-smoked in Jubilat's back room. In the freezer, you'll find frozen containers of homemade stew. There's a rich, meaty tripe stew and a sauerkraut version. $2.99-4.99 Excellent pierogies, stuffed with potato-cheese or mushroom-sauerkraut, are in the refrigerated section. Just warm some oil in a pan and fry those suckers up. Family Brand $2.99 And, imported from Poland, there's pickled herring fillets with red peppers: Eat them on dark bread with a slice of cucumber and a shot of vodka (pick up your Polish vodka across the street at Adam's Liquors, owned by a Polish couple). Lowell Brand $2.99 608 5th Ave Brooklyn, NY 11215 (718) 768-9676

What to Eat at the UN Summit on Hunger

POST:
 When you sit down to discuss the plight of the world's starving, you should, perhaps, not dine on lobster and foie gras. In 2002, the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization summit met to discuss how to halve the number of starving people worldwide—and then ate themselves silly on items that only a fraction of a fraction of the world's population can even dream of. Naturally, when the The Times (UK) reported on this lavish menu, there were enough charges of hypocrisy to go around. Today, The Times looks back on the scandal, and reveals this year's menu, which has been much subdued. That's Robert Mugabe, above, arriving in Rome, totally ready for some pasta with cream sauce. Sure I'd rather eat the 2002 menu, but that doesn't make it right. 2002 menu Foie gras and toast with kiwi fruit Lobster in vinaigrette Fillet of goose with olives Seasonal vegetables Compote of fruit with vanilla Vins multiple fine wines 2008 menu Vol au vent with sweetcorn and mozzarella Pasta with cream of pumpkin and shrimps Veal olives with cherry tomatoes and basil Fruit salad with vanilla ice cream Vin Orvieto Classico Poggio Calvelli 2005

Nice job highlighting how those who profit from 'development' are so, so far away from those on whose behalf they supposedly labor. I suppose the poor should just eat more lobster and stop complaining about there not being enough rice.

Adventures in Press Releases: The Anti-Energy Drink
AUTHOR:
Sarah DiGregorio
DATE:
2008-06-4 10:49:00
POST:
There are plenty of strange products out there, and they all need a publicist. This morning, I got in to the office and was greeted by a message from a sleepy- sounding woman calling about Drank "the anti-energy drink we're calling the extreme relaxation beverage." Isn't that already covered by a little thing called wine? No? This was too good to pass up, so I gave a call back. Turns out, this is a carbonated, grape-flavored beverage spiked with melatonin, valerian root and rose hips. Apparently it is "very, very popular in Houston," and it's sold throughout the south in liquor and convenience stores. So, does it make you sleepy? I asked the publicist. Yes, and she hears it's good with vodka. Oh, something that makes it more likely I'll fall asleep while drinking? Excellent. What, you might wonder, was the creator thinking? I'm glad you asked. He was thinking of the hip hop community. Direct from the press release: The drink's tagline is "slow your roll." So if that's something you need to do, keep your eye out. Drank will be hitting stores in New York soon. From design to production, every aspect of this calming drink was inspired by today’s popular hip hop artists who embrace the much sought-after hip hop lifestyle that encourages people to capture a stress-free state of mind.

I live in Houston, and the convenience store at the end of the block has this stuff. While I am aware of the links to the hiphop drug culture, my fiancee and I actually find this stuff a fairly decent insomnia cure. I take melatonin most nights anyway, and it's got the same amount of melatonin, PLUS the valerian, etc. So yeah. Weird stuff, questionable origin, but does have at least one decent use.

I love this stuff!! We sell it at work (a Dallas-area tobacco shop) and it does what it says! for those who are saying "more energy is better, not less!" ... Well, i guess you've never had an anxiety or sleeping disorder. This stuff is seriously like a dose of Tylenol pm. It also mixes very well with grape, vanilla, or plain vodka! If you mix it, you get a serious buzz like youve had twice as much to drink (so drink at home please!) but absolutely no hangover! Don't be fooled by imitations like Purple Stuff though, they may taste really good but they don't deliver any effect at all like Drank does. That's why it flies off the shelves, even at 5 bucks a can!!

Drank is great cure for people trying to get to sleep without the use of alcohol. I brought some home for family and friends in NJ and they loved it. It seriously makes you tired, so don't drink it if you're going out. That is definitely counter productive. But it tastes great and helps me get to sleep without "knocking you out" like other sleep aids. And the can is big, so if you get up in the middle of the night and you haven't finished your can, take a sip. Boom. Sleeping again.

Interesting. Houston rapper DJ Screw is the first person I remember talking about "drank," a concoction with codeine in it, and a host of others bring it up, too. "Gettin' their lean on," and slowing down.

It's pretty obvious they're patterning this drink after "purple drank," a.k.a. Sprite with prescription cough syrup containing promethazine and codeine. It was popularized by Houston's DJ Screw, who happened to die from OD'ing on the stuff, and is very popular in the hip hop community in the south. There have been many songs about it or that mention in, mostly from Houston or southern rappers, however it is also mentioned on Jay-Z's "Big Pimpin," in which Houston rapper Pimp C mentions it by one of its other names, lean, in his first line (last verse): "Uh, smokin out, throwin up, keep it lean up in my cup..." Pimp C died from a combination of his sleep apnea and elevated levels of promethazine and codeine in his system. I grew up and went to school in the South Park area of Houston, near where DJ Screw started putting out his underground mix tapes, and use of syrup/lean/drank became very popular in the late 90's in that area.

Purple Drank is slang for cough syrup, promethazine, and codeine. Look up what it behind the silly name, before you give it free advertising, man. Even googling "Drank" without any arguments would have turned up enough to make one suspicious.

just so y'all know, 'rolling' is slang for being high on exstacy, this drink is pretty brazenly being marketed as a come-down, a sort of more user-friendly quaalude. if you're all coked up, or on some kind of speed or hallucinogen, you drink this and it calms you down some. that's the point.

I found the distributor for Drank when I was at a convenience store in Houston. It gets delivered with the Redline drinks. The van says Mooney Distributing 281-354-7919 and the web site is redlinedrinks.com It ain't on their van or site but they got it. I bought a case from the driver for 30 bucks which is store prices for 24 cans. Stores sell it for 2.49 per can so that is cheap. The driver says individuals usually pay 40- 50 per case but they had too many for that days route so I got lucky. They got cool videos under media on the site. Mix redline and drank and yo won't need alcohol!

Melatonin is a wonderful natural sleep aid (naturally made in your body). It should be taken before bedtime in controlled doses every night. It sometimes takes a week before getting the full effects. It can be bought at most grocery and health food stores. Valerian root may have some toxicity. Google it for varied answers. Which means drinking it with alcohol is not a smart thing, neither is putting it in a gimmicky energy drink marketed for hip hop culture. Grape drink with downers yo.

But it turns out to be a really interesting place, with homemade headcheese elevating the papaya salad, and a jellyfish salad that's a riot of textures. Tien Pham, an eighty-year-old lifetime cook and friend of Duong came out of retirement to help create the menu, and he says she calls him several times a night to make sure he's making everything properly.

POST:
 The Porkchop Express has a very informative interview today with Cesar Fuentes, director of the Red Hook Food Vendors Committee, and while we're excited to hear that the vendors may be operating year round, it's a little depressing that the scrappy tents will be replaced with generic vending trucks. ETA for tacos at the fields is mid-June, but the vendors are still wading through health department bureaucracy, so we'll have to wait and see. From Porkchop, some relevant data: The Red Hook Soccer Field Food Tents will look very different: out with the tents, in with the city-mandated mobile food vending trucks. The Red Hook Soccer Field Food Tents will taste the same: as of our interview, each of last year's vendors is planning on returning. The Red Hook Soccer Field Food Tents might expand their days and months of operation: the new permits are valid year-round.

Fancy Restaurant in the Middle of Union Square?
AUTHOR:
Sarah DiGregorio
DATE:
2008-06-2 13:29:00
POST:
 You may have noticed that the Union Square greenmarket has been shifted south, crowding the farmers' stands up next to the painters and the creepy dude giving out "free hugs." That's because the city plans to convert the pavilion at the north side of the square from a children's playground into an upscale restaurant. If you feel (as Our Man Sietsema and I do) that digging up the north end of the square for yet another expensive restaurant is not such a good idea, you can go to a demonstration on Wednesday at 5pm against the proposed privatization. Details, and press release after the jump. PRIVATIZE UNION SQUARE? LOCAL ACTIVISTS SAY "NO!" MAJOR DEMONSTRATION SET FOR WED., JUNE 5, 5 P.M. NEW YORK – Save Union Square 2008, a group of concerned New York residents, has taken up the fight to stop privatization of a historic portion of Manhattan's Union Square. Last Wed., they began holding weekly events to raise opposition to plans by the city and private interests to convert the historic Pavilion at the north end of Union Square from a children's indoor playground and community space into a private, upscale restaurant. This week, members say the campaign goes into high gear with a major demonstration coinciding with the Annual Meeting of the Union Square Partnership. The Partnership is the organization of Union Square merchants that has taken charge – with Mayor Bloomberg's support – of redevelopment of the park. Who: Save Union Square 2008 What: Rally against privatization of Union Square Where: NE corner of Union Square Park, at E17th Street, Manhattan When: Thurs., June 5, 5 p.m. Hereafter, every Wed. at 5pm, Save Union Square 2008 promise to be in the park, performing, recruiting, and urging passersby to sign an online petition and contact Councilperson Rosie Mendez, who has the power to stop this terrible plan. Public opposition still has a chance to stop the bulldozing and conversion of the Pavilion. Since 2006, the plan has been in limbo due to a lawsuit filed by the Union Square Community Coalition. Despite rallying the support of numerous elected officials (see www.saveunionsquare.org), private interests and the Bloomberg administration sneaked through a review-and-approval process that appeared rigged from the outset. That transaction is now under review in court (saveunionsquare2008.blogspot.com). "We have a real chance to stop this, so it's crucial that the people's voice be heard," says Mark Read, a professor at nearby New York University and member of Save Union Square 2008. "Union Square has a tremendous tradition of free speech, going back to the days of Emma Goldman and Paul Robeson, that's still very much alive. It's a vibrant gathering place for people from throughout the city – check it out any day this summer. Giving away space that should be for children and community use, and turning it into a watering hole for the affluent would be a travesty. Yet, as so often in the past, City Hall is trying to do it under our noses."

The proposal for a private, up-scale restaurant by the Parks Department and the Union Square Partnership is ill-conceived and would be a detriment to Union Square Park. There are scores of restaurants and places to eat surrounding the park, so there is no need for another one in the pavilion. The pavilion itself should be refurbished and returned to the public for community and children's activities. The expropriation of scarce public land and facilities is not yet regulated by the City Council. It should be. The residents of the community, as well those from every district of the city, regularly visit Union Square Park. It is their destination park, a national historic landmark with a grand tradition of free access, open assembly and a forum for free speech. The proposal to privatize the park's pavilion to privilege a restaurant would change the entire character of the park. The community has waited decades for the pavilion to be repaired to serve the increasing need for space and leisure activities of a burgeoning population of children and families. The less affluent, unable to pay the high prices of the café or even the modest cost at a take-out counter would, for the first time in Union Square, feel the sting of discrimination and would no longer have free access to the pavilion. Ironically, the Parks Department cites the deterioration itself as the reason for a private remedy for that neglect. Columbus Park which has the City's other remaining park pavilion is currently being renovated for the exclusive use of the community, while the pavilion in Union Square Park is being designed for the specific needs of a restaurant. This is unacceptable. The three plans presented to the public thus far, by the Parks Department and the BID have not offered an alternative design for public use only. It is now time for them to listen to the community and do so. The City, local BIDs and the Parks Department are increasing their attempts to alienate public parkland for commercial use. Every piece of our fast-disappearing parkland and facilities is precious and its loss contributes to the deterioration of the quality of life for City residents and their families—who, by the way, pay taxes to support the much-needed amenity of free and open access to all parts of our parkland. One of the main factors in the push for privatization is that the parks are notoriously underfunded, which is especially egregious considering the millions of dollars--possibly hundreds of millions dollars more--that the taxpayers will be shelling out for the Mets' and Yankees' "privately financed" stadiums. Under this administration, the score of parkland takeovers for commercial purposes is rising at an alarming rate. The City supports such schemes, and the City Council seems unaware of how much of our green space is slipping away from public to private use. A recent example is the Brooklyn Waterfront project's accommodations for building high-end condominiums. Unfortunately, such commercial projects in and around parks provide a value added for the rich and a net loss of public parkland at the expense of the public. Stuyvesant Park is now also threatened, as is Union Square Park, by the Department's promotion of restaurants and kiosks in very small parks. Such schemes are not in the public interest at these sites, or in ones we don't know about yet. An alarming example is the almost successful Yankees' expropriation of two Bronx parks without notice to or approval by the local community board and residents. Only by accident did the community find out that the stadium was virtually a done deal, scheduled to sail through the City Council without thorough examination of the public versus private issues involved. Were it not for angry community protests, negotiations to relocate the parks and "sweeteners" to the community would not have been provided. In the same way, in 2004, the Campaign to Save Union Square Park led the fight against the original proposal. They alerted the public to the Department's renovation plan to minimize the children's playground in order to accommodate an outdoor terrace for a year-round exclusive restaurant. That proposal was roundly rejected by the public. and in the latest proposal the playground will be expanded to the maximum space available --14,687 square feet instead of a mere 8,200 square feet. The Parks Department, however, still intent on privatizing the pavilion, now proposes a seasonal restaurant in the pavilion during the season of greatest public use. The opposition of elected officials to privatization helped tremendously to win the playground expansion and to defeat the Department's and local BID's attempt to establish a year-round restaurant in the park. Strong opposition to such plans are even more important now. The tenacious efforts of the Parks Department to continue its attempt to privatize the pavilion with not so veiled threats of withdrawing funds from the project must be countered by the City Council and ensure that funding for the renovation is kept intact in order to support the whole community's fight and to secure the pavilion's 2,500 square feet of space for public, not private use. Unfortunately, the City Council and the public too often learn of many of these maneuvers after the fact. Without an official antidote and regulation of the Parks Department's privatization agenda, the public interest will continue to be ignored. The City Council must ensure an administrative process to oversee the out-of-control Parks Department. Members of the committee for the Campaign to Save Union Square Park; the hundreds of park users who signed our petition; 60 block associations, city and statewide organizations and local political clubs, as well as 20 national, state and local elected officials and other countless members of the community are opposed to the latest plan. The community is united in its determination to reject the Parks Department's misguided proposal for "fixing" the pavilion. A better proposal would be to privilege the public's need for more space in which to continue the park's great tradition of free and open access for everyone to enjoy all sorts of community-enhancing events.

My friends, here is a video of poor, ancient John McCain shuffling around a grocery store until there is a "clean up on aisle three" situation. He seems entirely baffled by the whole experience. Maybe that's because Cindy McCain doesn't have any actual family recipes... (unless mixing Vicodin with Xanax counts). [From Serious Eats]

Cheap Lunch! Deluxe Food Market

POST:
 Cheap Lunch! A new feature highlighting places to get great, cheap lunches. Deluxe Food Market How cheap? $3.75 Deluxe Food Market practices truth in advertising. Yes, it is a very deluxe food market, with a fantastic meat-fish-frozen grocery selections (with rapid turnover), as well as two long sets of steam tables and two Cantonese roast meat take out counters. There's one whole freezer dedicated solely to frozen dumplings, where you'll find big, utilitarian bags of everything from crab shumai to watercress-chicken. It's a fantastic place, and could just as easily be filed under Best Markets. The only drawback is that you shouldn't go if you're feeling stressed or are in a hurry, as the space is very tight, very crowded and sometimes difficult to navigate quickly. Join the line at the steam tables near the back entrance (where there are tables and chairs) if you want to eat in, or stick to the steam tables down in front if you want to take out. The deal is this: 4 items (not including rice; rice can be one of your items) for $3.75. The signs posted in front of the various dishes are not usually accurate, so just take a look at everything and point to what looks good. Here's what looked good to me: Clockwise from left: Fried shrimp, bean curd skin wrapped around cabbage and pork, ma po tofu and stewed beef short ribs.  You can also get dumplings and buns. The steamed roast pork buns are only $.70, but are pretty ordinary. Not so the pork and chive dumplings (below), which are pan-fried and crispy on the bottom; the filling is completely delicious. They are also gigantic; each one is about half the size of my fist. $1.50 for four.  Then there's the roast pig, duck and lacquered racks of ribs that hang in the windows. I got the ribtips with honey glaze, which I thought pretty spectacular, especially if you like sweetish glazes on pork. $2.99/pound ($3.59 for the pack below)  79 Elizabeth St New York, NY 10013 (212) 925-5766

Fork in the Road at Hundred Acres and Forge (Plus Recipe)

POST:
 This week, I review Hundred Acres and Forge, both of which are trying for "haute barnyard" appeal. (The online version's second page doesn't have paragraph breaks; that should be fixed soon; thanks for your patience.) In other news, Hailey Eber, of Radar magazine, writes a weekly dining newsletter for us, and you should sign up for it here . This week, Hailey got the pastry chef at Forge to give up her butterscotch pudding recipe. Butterscotch Pudding Yield: 6 servings 4 tablespoons unsalted butter 1 cup dark brown sugar 1/2 teaspoon salt 1 cup heavy cream 2 cups whole milk 2 tablespoons scotch 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 2 large eggs 2 envelopes powdered gelatin 1/2 cup Crème Fraîche (recipe below) In a medium sauce pot, combine the butter, brown sugar and salt. Cook over medium heat until butter is melted and sugar is almost dissolved, stirring frequently. Whisk in the heavy cream, milk, scotch and vanilla extract and continue to whisk until just hot but not boiling. In a medium-sized mixing bowl, lightly whisk the two eggs. Slowly pour approximately half of the hot cream mixture over eggs, whisking constantly. Add the egg and cream mixture to the sauce pot with the remaining cream mixture, whisking constantly. Cook the pudding over low heat, continuing to whisk often, until it just bubbles around the edge of the pot. Remove from heat, slowly sprinkle in the powdered gelatin, whisking constantly to prevent any lumps. Then strain into a large metal bowl. Place the bowl over another bowl of ice water to chill and set the pudding. Once cool, spoon into desired dishes and serve with a dollop of Crème Fraîche. [Okay, we're thinking this might be a logistical challenge for the potluck, but those Spaniards did bring an entire leg of jamón.] Homemade Crème Fraîche Yield: 1 cup 8 ounces heavy cream 1 ounces buttermilk Combine the two ingredients with a quick stir, then pour into a glass mason jar and close with a screw-top lid. Let the filled jar sit out at room temperature for 24 hours to thicken slightly and ferment. Then refrigerate the cheese until cold, thicker, and ready to use.

POST:
 This week, Our Man finds himself a stranger in a strange land, trying to decipher the strange culinary landscape of Sakae Sushi—no small task as the sushi bar offers 208 dishes in 28 catagories. The sushi, which you can pluck ready-made off a conveyer belt, or order (by keying it into your own little computer or by telling a real live server), is generally middling. Our Man samples a lot of it, and it comes down to this: But Sakae Sushi isn't just another run-of-the-mill neighborhood sushi bar. It turns out that the chain hails from Singapore, which accounts for its through-the-looking-glass take on Japanese food. Sushi with a side of globalization—get used to it! Some of the sushi isn't half bad, and the price is right I invited my thespian friend Carmen, who grew up in Singapore, to scan the menu. She giggled when she came upon "chicken katsu cheese yaki," which turned out to be a flattened gray cutlet smothered in cheese sauce flavored with sharp mustard. "That's like something my Chinese mom would throw together," she exclaimed. It was awful. According to her, the menu's obsession with jellyfish turned out to be another tip-off to Singaporean influence, as did the red and rubbery baby octopi

Ted Allen's New Show, Celery, and why Anthony Bourdain won't Guest Star
AUTHOR:
Sarah DiGregorio
DATE:
2008-07-29 11:16:00
POST:
Ted Allen's new show, Food Detectives, premieres tonight on the Food Network at 9pm. We talked to Allen about the new show, Top Chef New York (his lips are sealed) and where he likes to eat in the city. So tell me about the new show. It’s called Food Detectives. We take myths and stories and old wives tales, and partnering with experts from Popular Science magazine, we test them out. The victims are my henchpersons, who do things like eat a whole bunch of habaneros and then we see what will ease the pain. Milk products, right? Well, I hate to give everything away, but it’s no accident that spicy cuisines from different cultures are served with dairy—Indian with raita, hot wings with blue cheese dip…there may be a good reason for that. And then, the Popular Science people reveal the science behind that—it turns out that there’s a protein in milk called casein that binds to capsaicin, that element in peppers that irritates your tongue, and it literally washes that capsaicin out, and takes you back to happy land. Has anything really surprised you so far? Anything that you thought was a myth that turned out to be true, or vice versa? Well, we’re going to be taking viewer questions, but right now since we don’t have viewers, we don’t have viewer questions. So we set up a website for people to write in, and Bob from Iowa wanted to know if it was true that celery has negative calories. The theory goes that chewing it burns more calories than is in the celery. And I was surprised to find that while that’s not exactly true, the fact is that celery is so fibrous that it takes lots of energy to digest, so technically it does result in slight negative calorie advantage. I guess I should eat more celery! [Laughs] Yeah, you know testing the 'five second rule' is not going to win us the Noble Prize, but it’s funny and different, a strange mix of realism and fantasy and craziness. It’s less about the end result and more about the journey being fun and funny. So who are your unfortunate henchmen? Are they people viewers will recognize? They are actually people who do not speak on the show, and no, viewers they won’t know who they are. In a way I wish I could bring on known guests chefs, because I’ve met so many great people in the last couple years, but this is not one that Anthony Bourdain is going to want to do. Why not? Well, he’s a brave guy, but he’s not going to want to stick his head in a disgusting refrigerator to see if baking powder really works to absorb odors. Maybe one of these days. Speaking of refrigerators, what’s in yours that might surprise people? I have 19 different kinds of mustard; I love Coleman’s; I love hot mustards and horseradish. I like a lot of spicy stuff; I love Sriracha. I like things that have really intense flavor. And they’re not in my refrigerator, but I love tomatoes. They’re only really edible for about one and half months each year, and that time is about to start. I’m going to the Greenmarket this weekend to get my hands on some great tomatoes. It’s the best culinary moment of the whole year. I’ll make a caprese and drizzle nice olive oil over it. I’ll take that over a truffle any day. Where do you like to eat out in the city? In my neighborhood, Clinton Hill, there’s a wood-fired pizza place called Graziellas [232 Vanderbilt Avenue, Brooklyn, 718-789-5663]. I love it. They have a roof top deck, and super thin, crispy crust. They don’t do delivery, because it’s the kind of thing you have to eat in five minutes, and after that it turns into something else. Some of the best pizza in the world is in New York, and it’s all about the crust. I’m a little behind on basic New York restaurant literacy, because I work all the time. But one of my favorite things about doing Top Chef and Iron Chef, is meeting these chef-heroes, and getting their cell phone numbers. I always try to go to Lidia Bastianich’s or Alfred Portales’ restaurants, and having met them and gotten their cell phone numbers makes it easier to get a reservation! Meeting those chefs is really my favorite thing about working on food T.V. Can you tell us anything about the Top Chef that’s shooting now in New York? [Laughs] I’m not at liberty to say! They’re crazy about secrecy. With any of these shows as they get more popular, there’s increased scrutiny from blogosphere. With The Next Food Network Star, there were people literally stalking the production. Anything else you’d like us to know about the new show? Once we get into regular showings on Tuesday nights, viewers will write in with questions they want to have answered, and it might be really fun to do one on what really is in a hot dog. So it’s not necessarily just about myths—there are only so many myths around for us to debunk—the format is flexible, it’s about interesting stories and going behind the scenes. And you know, hot dogs, we’re all a little afraid that there really are snouts and tails and eyeballs in there, but it would be nice to be able to have a Nathan’s hot dog every now and then. And even if it is snouts and tails, maybe it’s still not that scary? I’m kind of on a rampage lately to never eat processed foods, not just because they’re full of fat and preservatives, but industrial food just freaks me out. And we now have access to so many great organic, local products. Industrial producers will do anything they can to make it cheap; it’s worth it to spend a little more... I’ve been doing food T.V. now for 5 years, but it’s all been reality shows like Queer Eye, or judging. So it’s an interesting challenge, because for Food Detectives I have to learn lines! But it’s nice to have a little bit more control over the language and the jokes. This one really indulges my geeky interest in the science side of food, but also has a lot of opportunity for humor. I think it’s a lot of fun. Is your show influenced by Alton Brown’s Good Eats? That comparison is inevitable, because both shows deal with science and food. If Alton were here, he would draw a diagram showing that where we intersect is at food and science, and where we diverge is that Alton is actually showing you how to cook things, and I’m not doing anything that useful. [Laughs] Food Detectives is more comedic, and more about story. Nobody is replacing Alton! He’s a good friend and a great source of information.

I was getting a real odd vibe from Ted, then I realized that he was speaking memorized lines for probably the first time in his life! He was really awkward and seemed to not know what to do with his hands. All the tests they did I've seen before as well, whether on Good Eats, Mythbusters, or Brainiac. Those silent "henchmen" freaked me out too. Assistants are allowed to have personalities!

Seriously. The first episode was an overproduced dud. Why should I watch this when I watch Mythbusters and Good Eats already. Also, having Ted be the only personality on the show is kind of strange. His shtick is fine, but all the over-emoting non-speaking cast is just... wierd.

Behind the Scenes Umami-Fest with Chef Kunio Tokuoka
AUTHOR:
Sarah DiGregorio
DATE:
2008-07-25 11:49:00
POST:
Chef Kunio Tokuoka with umami-rich kelp Chef Tokuoka of Kyoto's Kitcho restaurant is in town to cook at the James Beard House next Tuesday. Tokuoka is known for traditional kaiseki cuisine, but his showcase at the James Beard House is billed a "Modern Japanese Dégustation," centered on umami—the elusive taste often described as "savoriness." This morning, I went by the Bouley test kitchens to watch Tokuoka as he tested and tweaked his recipes for next week's dinner. He's friends with David Bouley and says they'd like to do a project together in the "near future." Tokuoka brought two cooks with him from his team at Kitcho. They all came to New York straight from San Francisco, where they had been attending a celebration of the 100th anniversary of the discovery of umami, and where Tokuoka ate at the French Laundry and Bouchon. In New York, he's planning on hitting Bouley and Jean-Georges. Tokuoka shopped for ingredients at Chelsea Market and Whole Foods, but he'd brought two key, umami-rich ingredients with him from Japan: kombu (giant dried kelp) from the Dohnan region in Hokkaido, which he says produces the sweetest kelp, and bonito, a fish fillet which is aged for about a year, much the way country ham is, until all the moisture has gone out of it and it is completely hard. It's said to be the hardest cooking ingredient; you can knock it against something and it sounds like wood. Tokuoka also brought his own bonito shaving machine (photo after the jump). Kumiko Ninomiya, director of the Umami Information Center (who knew?) was also there, to answer questions about, well, umami. According to Ninomiya, the foods with the most umami are kelp, Parmesan cheese, tomatoes, shitake mushrooms and bonito. And apparently, it has recently been discovered that there are two different umami compounds: glutimate and inosinate. Kelp is rich in glutimate, while bonito is rich in inosinate, which is why the combination of the kelp and bonito is so powerfully umami-rich. They both have umami on their own, but, according to Ninomiya, when you put them together, "it's not one plus one equals two, it's more like one plus one equals seven. They enhance each other." And this gets Chef Tokuoka very excited. He told us that before these two compounds were understood, that chefs would think of umami in terms of dashi (stock often made with both kelp and bonito)—serving dashi with foods, or cooking foods in dashi. But now they know why, technically, that's such a good combination. And he says that this is important because when you really know exactly how to deploy umami in a powerful way, you are making very satisfying dishes without any oils or fats. Tokuoka was working on a kelp-stock risotto topped with big, freshly shaved flakes of bonito, diced kelp in soy, ground bonito in soy, grains of fried rice and tiny diced broccoli rabe marinated with salt and kelp. He asked us to try it and tell him if it suited American taste. I thought it was wonderful—totally simple but full of that mouth-filling savoriness that umami provides. And I've never had better bonito. Tokuoka is thinking of serving it after the main course at the James Beard House, as he said it's customary in Japan to serve rice at the end of the meal. How can cooks employ umami at home? Tokuoka recommends making a very simple salad: take broccoli rabe and dice it very small, season it with salt and let it sit for a few minutes. Then add thin strips of dried kelp and mix. This tastes a lot more complex than it sounds (it was one of the risotto toppers). He says you can toss this mixture with pasta. Or, you can serve the salad with what is called a Hot Springs Egg: Bring a pot of water to 145 degrees Fahrenheit. (That's well below boiling.) You can monitor the water temperature with a simple kitchen thermometer. Place a whole egg in the pot and cook it at 145 degrees for 30 minutes. Crack it out of the shell, and place it on a salad. The egg will have cooked to a delicate, pudding-like consistency. And before I left, I asked Ninomiya her thoughts on MSG, which was invented in Japan 100 years ago. "It's like salt or sugar," she said. "It's the processed, very pure form of a flavor. They were trying to create 100 percent pure umami. MSG functions like kelp stock. It enhances the flavor of all the ingredients and keeps all the flavors in harmony. But if you can taste MSG, you've used to much."

That means no Cracker Jack, too. (Mmmmm, Cracker Jack...)

Recipe Improv: Chef Chris Cheung

POST:
 Today we're playing recipe improv with Chef Chris Cheung of Monkey Bar. (Appropriately enough, it turns out Cheung was born in the year of the monkey.) Cheung is a native New Yorker whose grandparents lived on Mott Street in Chinatown. He started at Nobu when it opened, eventually becoming the sous chef there, and in 1997, he worked on the opening of Jean-Georges along with Wylie Dufresne, Didier Virot and Jehaingir Mehta (who has also played Recipe Improv). He has also been at Ruby Foos and was a chef/owner at Brooklyn's Little Bistro and Almond Flower Bistro in Chinatown. I threw zucchini, clams and cashews at Chef Cheung. Not a pretty combo, but that's why it's improv. Here's what he came up with. Zucchini, Cashews, and Clams Skewers Yield: 6 appetizers 1 zucchini 1 tablespoon butter salt and pepper 1 dozen clams, scrubbed clean 1 tablespoon minced cilantro pinch ground cumin 1/2 cup cashews, toasted and ground On a Japanese mandoline or with a chef’s knife, cut zucchini lengthwise into long thin strips. In a pan, combine the butter with generous pinches of salt and pepper along with 1 cup water, and bring to a boil. Add the clams, and when they have just begun to open, move the clams to one side of the pan, and add the zucchini to the other side. When clams are completely open, remove them from the water, discarding any clams that haven’t opened. Remove the zucchini, from the pan, reserving the cooking liquid, and lay the zucchini strips out on a cutting board. Remove the clams from their shells, and place one clam on each zucchini strip, and roll it up. Secure with a skewer, placing two clam-zucchini roll-ups on each skewer. Add the cilantro and cumin to the cooking liquid, and bring to a simmer. Simmer until reduced to glaze-like consistency. Pour the glaze into a small bowl, and pour the crushed cashews into a second small bowl. To serve, lay out the skewers on a serving platter, with the 2 bowls of glaze and cashews side by side. Dip each skewer into the glaze, then into the cashews to coat.

POST:
Ellis Bar Aaron's department store occupied the big, windowless white building at the corner of 5th Avenue and 17th Street in Brooklyn for decades. (Tagline: "Unless your husband's in the business, you're better off at Aaron's.") But last year Aaron's closed and a sign went up that the huge space was for rent. Then, another sign went up: "Southwestern American tapas." (Please let the trend of calling everything "tapas" end.) The conversion of the building (it's been subdivided so that the other half of Aaron's is still vacant) went on for months. Meanwhile the website was up, complete with menu, and it actually looks pretty interesting: four bean chili with Navajo fry bread, cornmeal crusted catfish, zucchini cakes with corn salsa. Last night, Ellis Bar finally opened, (now calling its food "new Western tapas") and I took a peek inside. It looks like a classic bar-restaurant, with darts and a pool table. Nothing high-concept going on design-wise, just a long, dark wood bar and a second room with a bunch of wooden chairs and tables. Meanwhile, signs outside advertised $5 Bacardi. That seems odd to me: Navajo fry bread and $5 Bacardi? I would think those two things appeal to very different customers (although...I like both). In any case, kudos to the owners for trying out something a little different, food-wise. I'll go check it out soon. Ellis Bar 627 5th Avenue at 17th Street Brooklyn 718-768-0532

I went there last night. The vibe is chill, the owners are friendly & the space is large and inviting. Their still waiting on their health dept. inspection, so no food yet. I've been in the neighborhood for 4 years & it's nice to see all these great new places opening up in the area.

Wylie Dufresne Plays with Tofu

POST:
Miso Soup with Instant Tofu Noodles Today, Wylie Dufresne was named the winner of the "House Foods Tofu Around the World Cook-off," in which four fairly big-name chefs had to prepare a sweet and savory tofu dish in just 25 minutes. Judges included Michael Romano, Peter Berley and Andrea Strong. Dufresne made two typically science-fiction-ish creations: Miso Soup with Instant Tofu Noodles and Warm Tofu Custard with Caramelized Banana and Granola Sleeves. Who knew granola had sleeves? The runners up: Hirousu and Kuzumochi from Akinobu Suzuki of Sakagura Crispy Tofu with Morels and Sweet Corn and Lemongrass and Basil Tofu Ice Cream with Tri-Star Strawberries and Salted Sesame from Erik Battes of Perry St. Café Tofu in Carrozza and Tofu Panna Cotta from Edward Higgins of Insieme The winning Dufresne recipes are after the jump, although you'll need to run down to the corner store for methyl cellulose in order to make them. Miso Soup with Instant Tofu Noodles SERVES FOUR PEOPLE INSTANT TOFU NOODLES 340 grams firm House brand tofu 150 grams water *6.1 grams methyl cellulose (Type A16M) Salt Toasted sesame oil Bring water to a boil and shear in A16M and blend with tofu. Season with salt and sesame oil to taste and chill to 55°F. Once cool, place the mixture into a piping bag and use to fill individual squeeze bottles. Reserve in fridge until needed. MISO SOUP 3 liters water 165 grams bonito flakes 55 grams kombu 30 grams red miso paste Hold water and kombu at 140°F for one hour. Remove kombu and raise heat to 176°F and add the bonito flakes, turn off heat. Let the flakes soak for ten minutes and strain out the kombu and whisk in the miso paste. TO SERVE 2 scallions, thinly sliced 4 shiitake mushrooms, sliced and lightly sautéed Warm four soup bowls and place some shiitake and scallion in each bowl. Ladle 4 ounces of soup into each bowl and serve with one of the tofu mixture squeeze bottles. Direct the diner to squeeze tofu into the soup and stir. Tofu noodles will form instantly. * Methyl Cellulose forms a gel when heated and melts into liquid when cools. In general, its amount should be 1-1.5% of the rest of the ingredients. Methyl Cellulose can be ordered on www.le-sanctuaire.com. Warm Tofu Custard with Caramelized Banana and Granola Sleeves SERVES FOUR PEOPLE TOFU SLEEVES 350 grams firm House brand tofu 70 grams sugar 35 grams glucose powder Blend the above three ingredients together and spread onto acetate sheets 3” x 41/2” and allow to air dry overnight. BANANA GRANOLA 250 grams rolled oats 25 grams orange juice 35 grams brown sugar 12 grams honey Pinch salt 125 grams dried banana Mix all of the above ingredients, except for the dried banana, together in a bowl and spread onto a baking tray. Bake at 350°F for 30 minutes and allow to cool. Fold in the dried banana. Using a heat sealer, shape the tofu rectangles into packages and stuff with the granola and seal. Place in 125°F oven for six hours until crispy; reserve. CARAMEL 250 grams milk *5 grams gellan gum (low acyl) 125 grams caramelized sugar 190 grams brown butter 1.5 grams salt 36 grams gelatin, bloomed Shear gellan into milk and bring to a boil and place in a blender while running. Add the sugar, brown butter, bloomed gelatin, and the salt (in that order). Pour out onto a tray and allow to cool. Once cool, using a ring cutter punch out rounds to fit the bottom of four dessert bowls. * Gellan gum can be also be ordered on www.le-sanctuaire.com. TOFU CUSTARD 170 grams soft House brand tofu 30 grams sugar 75 grams A16 solution* Blend the above ingredients together and reserve. *A16 SOLUTION 200 grams water 1 gram methylcellulose (type A16) Bring the water to a boil and shear in the A16, cool to 55°F. TO SERVE 1 banana, thinly sliced 20 grams sugar Sprinkle the sugar onto the banana slices and caramelize with a blow torch. Place a caramel disk into four dessert bowls and ladle 4 ounces of the tofu custard into each bowl. Wrap with plastic and bake at 200°F for fifteen minutes. Remove the plastic and top with caramelized bananas and place a tofu granola sleeve into each bowl and serve. Direct diners to crush the sleeve onto the custard and enjoy!

Our Man, the Freek and the Bidet

POST:
 Today, Our Man Sietsema takes us on a wild ride to the Pharoh (sic) Café in Ridgewood, Queens. At this Egyptian hookah cafe, Our Man likes the foul and the kuftas, and especially the miloukhia soup: He also likes quail stuffed with freek, a little-known ancient grain. And then, there is an encounter with a bidet. Perhaps a first for a restaurant review? Faced with such challenging dinner material, Our Man finally succumbs to the lure of the hookah, and floats away on nicotine dreams. Best of all, though, was the miloukhia soup ($12), a dense green swamp with a slimy texture. It came with a big plate of rice ringed with tender chunks of stewed lamb. Another favorite was bashamel ($6), a casserole fabricated from pasta, white béchamel sauce, and ground meat. Emblazoned across the box was "Pilot Bidet," with a picture of a plastic contraption hooked up to the back of a toilet seat. Before we could stop him, Scooter engaged our host in an animated discussion of the device (for sale at $79), culminating in a trip to the restroom, where one had been installed. He reported that the contraption has regulatory knobs and a nozzle that squirts water, intended to cleanse the nether regions in lieu of toilet paper. "It looks like it would send droplets all over the place," he grimaced. We shuddered, but continued eating.

Tony Bourdain in Saudi Arabia

POST:
Danya Alhamrani runs Saudi Arabia's first female-owned production company Anthony Bourdain's newest No Reservations was on last night, in which he tours Saudi Arabia with Danya Alhamrani, a Saudi woman. (Danya won a contest in which viewers competed to play tour guide for Tony.) Every time No Reservations threatens to get old, or AB himself flirts with overexposure, they do something amazing like this. To me, this is the best kind of food television. Danya takes Tony on a tour of Saudi food, featuring both restaurants (A fried chicken fast food place that's a local favorite) and home cooking (Camel hump! It looks like a giant hunk of quivering fat). While Tony and Danya eat, they're also having having genuine, sometimes awkward, sometimes funny conversations about why, for instance, Saudi restaurants segregate women away from non-related males. And why a smart, successful, funny woman might actually think that's a good idea. You can read Tony's account of the whole shebang here, and the No Reservations producer's blog here, on what it was like to be a female producer in Saudi Arabia. Find out more about Danya Alhamrani here.

I caught this the other night and I totally agree. On one hand, what Bourdain turned up was kind of banal and predictable. Yes, there are well to do Saudis like Danya and her family who live comfortable lifestyles, enjoy themselves, and aren't dour religious zealots. That's not exactly a secret. But the glimpses of Saudi life, and Danya herself, were fascinating. She is a smart, funny and successful woman who grew up partly in the Midwest. You know she believes her country must change, and if change does come, it will be people like her who will bring it. Yet she accommodates herself to the gross misogyny of her culture, and rationalizes it to some extent. The scenes of her in public, covered from head to toe but revealing her face (shocking!)and surrounded by women completely covered in those hideous black shrouds, spoke volumes about Saudi society. As far as the food, most of it looked like crude desert fare, and less than appetizing, with the exception of the final meal with Danya and her family. How anyone can live without vino, though, is beyond me. This was one of Bourdain's best recent shows, although the one in Laos, where he points out the terrible destruction the US rained on that country during the Vietnam war, also was excellent.

Midtown Lunch's Street Meat Extravaganza

A different sort of street meat Check out Midtown Lunch's amazing blind taste test of street meat from 13 different carts. As they point out, it's easy to think that all that lamb (or chicken) and rice is the same, but each cart uses different spices, and has their own spin on white sauce and hot sauce. To me, a good hot sauce is key. Of the 13 entrants, Rafiqi’s came in surprisingly low, and the popular Kwik Meal cart came in fifth, beat out by some no-name carts. That's the fun of a blind taste test. The famous 53rd & 6th Halal Chicken & Rice cart came in first overall, also capturing the "Best Hot Sauce" award.

Red Hook Ballfields Up and Running

POST:
Photo by Gabi Porter As I'm sure you've heard from multiple sources, the Red Hook ballfields vendors returned this weekend, at least most of them. There were six families selling food out of their DOH-approved trucks; the four missing vendors are still in the process of getting their rigs approved. It's great to have them back, especially after all the bureaucratic nonsense involved in getting the contract and the necessary permits—not to mention the tens of thousands of dollars the vendors have had to spend to meet DOH approval. I know the trucks are a necessary evil, but I do miss the old set up—the immediacy of it and the way that the aromas coming off all the grills would mingle together. The practical differences that the trucks make seem to be twofold. First, it seems like the vendors have less cooking surface on the grills inside the trucks, and less room for the cooks themselves. This means that while the crowds have increased, the vendors' cooking pace is slower, and the lines were very, very long. Second, most of the vendors now have someone standing outside the truck taking money, keeping money-handling and food-handling separate. But the ballfields have always been about great food, and the food is still as good as ever. I went down to the Ecuadorian stall for some shrimp ceviche, which was exactly as I remember it: full of fat shrimp and red onion in a lime broth. The only difference is that the hot sauce and corn nuts aren't self-serve anymore, instead you get little plastic containers filled with them when you order. The beloved pupusas from the stall on the corner were still extraordinary. But while I remember the only filling options being meat/cheese or cheese, the stuffings have now been expanded to deluxe versions like jalapeño and cheese and zucchini. We got the jalapeño version, which turned out to also have diced carrots along with the chiles and the cheese. The cabbage slaw and vinegary hot sauce remain the same. The place was a media circus on Sunday, with television crews and hordes of food bloggers snapping pictures, not that I should talk. Chuck Schumer, Adrien Benepe and Marty Markowitz held a press conference there on Sunday afternoon, which I did not stay to hear. Anyone who did have any thoughts? I'm glad the vendors are getting the attention they deserve, but I do hope the fever pitch dies down a bit so that the ballfields can get back to being the relaxed, neighborly place they were. An interesting quote from the 1010 Wins report: What do you think? If you went this weekend, did you find it less enjoyable than in past years? I'm curious to hear your feedback. I think Goch has a point—I did find it a less enjoyable experience than in the past, but mostly because it was so overwhelmingly crowded. I think that the crowds will become more manageable as the summer goes on. And the thing is, the vendors attracted the city's regulatory attention only when they became so popular with the wider community. Now that the vendors have spent $30,000 to get in compliance, I think they deserve our loyalty and our continued business. That gorgeous picture above is by Gabi Porter, and there will be an entire slideshow of her images of the opening weekend up later today or tomorrow. I'll post the link here when it's up. "It's completely changed and not for the better,'' said Jon Goch, a nearby resident who said he had been buying food from the vendors for four years before the city cracked down. ``It used to be very organic, more open, more social. Now it's just another city-controlled event. There was an awesome thing going on, and they came in and ripped the soul out of it.''

I totally agreed with Gosh. They ruined this unique week-end events. I used to talk to the vendors, It was more of a family picnic I have been going to this park for 18 years and the friendship with the vendors is lost. This is the worst that this idiots at the DOHMH have done to me and vendors. I speak for my self, after eating at this park for the past 18 years i have never been sick from eating their food, and I do not need an agency to tell me from where I should be buying my food.

Once we got close we were choked to death with gasoline exhaust, and the cooks were missing their usual happy faces (because they were slaving away in a boiling hot truck). I felt really bad and responsible as a relatively new customer that my interest in their food inadvertently caused all this crap for everyone. I also agree with Eli, unless someone has gotten sick from their food the DOH crackdown is wholly unwarranted. I'll still go I guess...

 As of midnight tonight, all New York City chains have to post calorie listings, or face stiff fines from the DOH. Up until now, the law has been on the honor system—chains were supposed to have the listings posted, but couldn't be fined if they weren't complying. Only about one fourth of the restaurants posted the calories voluntarily, so tomorrow is the day of reckoning, when you'll see calorie counts everywhere from McDonald's to the movie theater concessions to Le Pain Quotidien. Luckily, the Red Hook ballfields won't be posting calories and that's where you'll find me, stuffing my face with pupusas and elotes, and back here to talk about it Sunday night or Monday morning.

Best Markets: Sunrise Mart
AUTHOR:

POST:
 Sunrise Mart is a Japanese grocery on the second floor just above the St. Marks Bookstore, and carries a wide array of Japanese products along with some Korean goods, like kimchi, banchan and pre-made pork bulgogi. It's a fun place to browse different varieties of soba, ramen or mochi, or pick up a box of Pocky, sweet-cracker sticks dipped in chocolate. I like "Men's Pocky," which are thin pretzel sticks dipped in bitter chocolate. Which, of course, is very masculine. But the best stuff at Sunrise Mart is in the refrigerator. Best Buys:  I'll just cut to the good stuff. OMFG people, I am now in possession of an enormous quantity of uni (sea urchin). This box (left), cost $15 and has about 15 big lobes of uni. I'm trying not to eat it up right now, at work, because that might freak people out even more than the stuff I usually eat. I plan to sit down all by myself and eat it straight from the box. If you need a little something more with your uni, just put it over soba or rice. Also in the fish cooler, sushi-grade fish: hamachi, squid, salmon and tuna, all of it looking beautiful and pristine and running from 10.99/pound to $19/pound. It's not cheap, but you don't need much of it, and it's more affordable than eating sushi out. Fertile eggs are eggs that were fertilized; the embryo stops developing at a very early stage so you can't see a little chick in there or anything. They are said to have a more creamy, luscious yolk than regular eggs. (Golden Fertile Eggs brand $6.45 dozen) There's an entire refrigerated case dedicated to different miso varieties. Generally, the darker the color, the stronger and saltier the flavor. I think shio, or white miso, is the easiest to cook with at home. It's very mild and sweet. You can boil it with water, scallions, seaweed and tofu for a quick miso soup, or mix it with a bit of sugar and spread it on fish before broiling it. (Shio miso, various brands, about $6.45 a pack.) And finally, the packaged bento boxes are fantastic. This one to the left cost $5.25 and contained brown rice, salmon fillet, shrimp-eggplant salad, seaweed salad, yam tempura, a gyoza, a marinated shitake and a piece of tamago (Japanese omelet). The only problem is that the tempura was very soggy from steaming in the container. Still, great stuff, and there are plenty of other bento combinations available. Sunrise Mart 4 Styuvesant Street, 2nd Floor 212-598-3040

It's time to tell the difference between Japanese, Korean, or Chinese for that matter. Sarah, with all due respect, this store does NOT carry a "jumble of Japanese and Korean goods." It IS a Japanese market (even the sign says so). I don't think I've ever seen a Korean packaged product sold there. SARAH RESPONDS: Thanks for your comment. I certainly didn't intimate that anything in the store was Chinese. Actually, the store carries a wide array of kimchi and banchan, which are quite solidly Korean, as well as a particular variety of sushi labeled "Korean-style" sushi. So although it is a Japanese market, it does carry Korean food. Perhaps "jumble" wasn't the best choice of words.

I think joe's point is well taken...carrying some kimchi and banchan is one thing (Korea was a Japanese colony for decades), but one might incorrectly infer from the article as written that there is a greater selection of Korean products. As for me, I love the rice cracker selection, myself! They have the most awesome big bags of mixed crackers, with seaweed, black sesame seeds, etc.....yum!! ___ FROM SARAH: Hi Mei, Point well taken then! It's clarified above. I'll have to go back for the rice crackers.

24-Hour Goat-Tripe Curry and Other Good Stuff

POST:
 The Pakistani neighborhood that runs down Coney Island Avenue in Midwood, Brooklyn, has a fairly vibrant restaurant scene, mostly made up of places that serve Pakistani/Bangladeshi or Turkish food. I stopped by Bukhari today for lunch. It's a small, steam-counter Pakistani place that does a very brisk business (always a good sign). It's also open 24 hours. I asked the guy behind the counter what he liked best. He pointed out a turmeric-yellow goat and tripe curry, so I asked for that, plus daal and rice. The curry was full of soft slices of onion, bits of cooked-down tomatoes, bone-in mutton and strips of chewy tripe. It was all held together in a dryer, spice-laden gravy, rather than a creamy, abundant one. The mutton was very tender and gamey in a good way. (Pick the bone up with your right hand and suck the meat off.) The daal was a mix of yellow split peas, which cook into a creamy mash, and urad dal, the tiny black lentils that hold their shape. It's a nice textural combination. The daal was spiked with ginger, and probably a good amount of butter, too. Even the rice was good, buttery basmati, augmented with chickpeas and faintly scented with cinnamon. I got a mutton biryani to go, and snuck a luscious bit of meat out of it as soon as I got home. It looks promising. A few doors down, Gourmet Sweets has an array of some of the freshest mithai (South Asian sweets) I've had in New York. If you think you don't like Indian sweets because of some horrible, overly sweet mithai you get at a restaurant, go try the almond burfi at Gourmet Sweets before you write mithai off altogether. I also liked their pistachio chumchum. Bukhari Restaurant 1095 Coney Island Avenue 718-859-8044 Gourmet Sweets 1107 Coney Island Avenue 718-421-4100

'Disaffected' Snail Hunters Cause Shortage
AUTHOR:
Sarah DiGregorio

POST:
 French snail-lovers should read Melissa Clark's essay in the New York Times today. In it, Clark details how much she loves "snail butter"—the garlicky, parsley-flecked butter that escargot are cooked in—and how little she actually likes the snails themselves. So instead, she comes up with a recipe for slathering the butter on grilled squid. The French may have to adopt this idea, because there is—quelle horreur!—a snail shortage in France. And why? It turns out that Eastern Europe used to provide France two thirds of all the snails consumed there. But now that Poland and Hungary have joined the EU, they can get better jobs than snail-pickers, thanks. Reports the UK's Independent: They weren't keen to do that? I can't imagine why not! And a bit of editorializing from the British writer: And then there is Madeleine Lechartier, 61, who says that there is no snail shortage, just too many lazy people who don't want to hunt their own snails. She, for one, gets up at 5am to turn over leaves and branches and snag her own snails. Says Madeleine: So there you have it folks, all the geo-political snail news that's fit to print. "In a glum statement, the French food processing industry announced that snail-collecting was now the object of "growing disaffection" among eastern Europeans. People were no longer keen to leave home before dawn on wet days, armed with a torch, to search the Polish forests or Hungarian scrubland for the "burgundy snail" or Helix pomatia." The attraction remains a mystery to much of the rest of the planet. The sauce served with the snails – made from garlic, parsley and butter – is delicious, but to the uninitiated, the escargot itself tastes like a tired piece of chewing-gum. "'People say there is a shortage but the wet summers of the last two years have been very kind to snails. I have 500 snails in my larder, already cooked. We will eat them little by little.'"

 This week: In which Our Man eats at Cabrito and pretty much loves it. From the tongue tacos to the mackerel en escabeche, huaraches and green chile stew, Our Man is liking David Schuttenberg's authentic-ish Mexican bistro. And it must be good, because Our Man will not mince words on a place like this if it irks him. Our Man also tells that Cabrito carries those distinctive, Baha-style fried fish tacos, which I haven't had since I left the West Coast. Very exciting. The only item that Our Man finds fault with is Cabrito's signature baby goat—he says it's "sour, stringy, and somewhat skanky." Yikes! But other than that, this is an Our Man-approved restaurant. "The joint is nominally a glorified taqueria, and the tacos are big and bold, if a bit pricey at $6 apiece. Never mind—you're in the door already, and the restaurant's amazing homemade chorizo probably justifies the price. Tongue is another toothsome taco filling, braised in a pale-green tomatillo sauce that adds just the right amount of acidity."

 The frozen yogurt craze baffles me; so this week, I take a look at what's really going on behind our insatiable hunger for this tangy, yogurt-ish substance. There's also a guide to telling the all these identical fro-yo companies apart. Just in the last couple weeks since I wrote the story, two or three more shops have opened. How many indistinguishable frozen yogurt shops will the market bear? So far, fro-yo is supremely recession-proof.

 Butterfinger and Baby Ruth candy bars, Toll House chocolate chips, Juicy Juice, Stouffer's and Lean Cuisine TV dinners: American food, right? Nope, they're all made by Nestlé, a Swiss conglomerate and the biggest food company in the world. Also, all the Miller beers (High Life, Lite) as well as Milwaukee's Best beer are actually owned by SABMiller, a South African company. Likewise, Coté d'Or Belgian chocolate and the Aussie favorite Vegemite, are actually owned by Kraft, an American company. Which is to say that all the good old boys crying into their Buds today over Anheuser-Busch's sale to InBev, the Belgian beer giant, are out of touch with the way big food companies are run these days. Any packaged food, no matter what sort of brand identity it has, is likely to be owned by one of three or four gigantic food corporations—whether it's Swiss Nestlé or American Kraft. And you know what else? Toyotas are made in West Virginia and Chevys are assembled in Canada. If you really need to be sure you're buying American, you should go to the Greenmarket.

What's Your Most Embarrassing Staple Meal?
AUTHOR:
Sarah DiGregorio
DATE:
2008-07-15 9:59:00
POST:
 Recently, Michael Ruhlman asked readers of his blog what their staple home-cooked meals are—the ones that you make again and again because they're easy, quick and you just really enjoy them. He says roast chicken with potatoes and green beans is his most-cooked meal, and asks readers to chime in with theirs. I'm always interested in this question (see "What's for Dinner," the recurring feature on this blog). And I always wonder if people answer honestly. I think if you stop someone on the street and ask them what they're having for dinner tonight, they might be more likely to answer you candidly than if they're sitting in front of their computer, typing up something that is (maybe) more aspirational. I mean, I'd hate for people to know how often I open a can of refried beans, spoon it into store-bought tortilla and call it a day. I do not, for instance, come home on a Monday night and make homemade pasta or pho. The responses on Ruhlman's blog are pretty interesting. For one thing, it turns out that most of us roast a chicken at least once a week. And I don't doubt that plenty of us are roasting chickens and making lovely grilled fish on a regular basis. But everyone's also got that meal that they make when they can barely manage to push the buttons on the microwave. So my question to you is this: What's your most embarrassing go-to meal? Go on, I told you mine.

SPAM!!! Couple quick slices with the knife, couple minutes a side in the pan, then onto a bun or, preferably, a heated flour tortilla...that way you can taste more SPAM instead of all the bread. It's gotten more expensive lately, but I always try to keep a can on hand. And, if you can find it, TREET is always a less expensive alternative: SPAM's bastard cousin.

Heat up sesame oil in a pan, throw in spaghetti, a couple of eggs, a little soy sauce (none of the yucky MSG kind), garlic powder, cayenne pepper and - if i'm feeling ambitious - chopped broccoli or spinach. Stirfry till spaghetti's starting to get crispy at the edges.

I can't remember the last time I enjoyed something as much as the spicy pork jerky from K.L. Malaysia Beef Jerky (pictured left). The shop makes Malaysian-style jerkies that are fabricated from thinly sliced squares of meat, marinated in a sweet-spicy brew, and grilled for ten minutes over a grate, so that the meat dries out slightly and caramelizes around the edges. It isn't anything like the chewy, desiccated meat product we think of as jerky. There are several varieties on offer: pork, spicy pork, beef, spicy beef, pork-shrimp and chicken. The pork is extremely tender and sweet, the beef is slightly tougher and a touch more savory. Pork-shrimp is awesome, a square composed of pork and shrimp that have been pounded together—it's not fishy, it just has an added funky depth. Spicy pork is my favorite, sweet-spicy and porky, like meat candy. I promise you, it's the culinary equivalent of crack—so delicious that I have become incapable of doing anything except sitting here and eating it. All of the varieties are about $16 a pound.

You may also be interested in trying the Thai version at Spicy Shallot in Woodside Queens. It is also delicious, though probably less robust than the varieties you describe.

Red Egg: Chinese Peruvian
AUTHOR:

POST:
Red Egg (202 Centre St.), a relatively new restaurant in Chinatown, describes itself as Chinese-Peruvian. This seemed like a wildly improbable combination to me until I learned that Peru actually has a large Chinese population, the biggest in Latin America. In Peru, Chinese-Peruvian food is known as chifa. Think of Chinese-Indian food—the spiced-up Chinese food beloved in India—and you get the idea. Chifa is Chinese food through the lense of Chinese immigrants cooking to Peruvian taste. So we stopped by for lunch today, and it was a mixed bag. There's an assortment of fairly traditional dim sum, and then an array of small and large plates that run from chicken chicharrones or octopus salad to frog legs with chives or clams with black bean sauce. Red Egg's version of Chinese-Peruvian fusion seems simply consist of including both Chinese and Peruvian items on the menu. Apparently, that's not what real chifa restaurants do, and since the Peruvian dishes we sampled were pretty hideous, I wish the place would drop the chifa-in-name-only gimmick and go with what it does well. Which, it turns out, is Cantonese dim sum. Our Chinese dishes were very good and obviously freshly made. The Peruvian dishes were not. A Red Egg lunch photo essay after the jump.  Above, steamed shrimp rice roll—a classic dim sum item, and very nicely done at Red Egg, with freshly steamed, chewy rice noodles.  Above, steamed fun gaw, translucent pork and seafood dumplings, some of the best I've ever had. The filling looked like it had been chopped and tossed together minutes before. Pork, diced greens, shrimp and peanuts were the major players.  Above, juicy Shanghai pork buns—very juicy, very porky.  Here's where we run into trouble. This simple ceviche would have been okay if the scallops and shrimp had not been of such poor quality. The scallops tasted like they had been frozen for months and recently defrosted. The only thing worth eating on this plate was the baby octopus, which tasted pleasantly of star anise.  Chicken chicharrones—deep-fried nuggets of chicken skin: The only problem with breading and frying chicken skin is that the coating gets nice and crisp, but the skin inside is still flaccid and chewy. This, I do not like.

Best Markets: Sahadi's 
AUTHOR:
Sarah DiGregorio
DATE:
2008-07-11 10:50:00
POST:
 Sahadi's has anchored the Middle Eastern neighborhood on Atlantic Avenue in Brooklyn Heights since 1948. The Sahadis are originally from Lebanon and they still make their own spice mixtures and roast their own nuts. Today, the whole place had the aroma of coffee and cardamom, a nice combination. Here you can find almost any Middle Eastern grocery staple—many varieties of dried fruits and olives, nuts, lentils and grains, all sold in bulk. There's also a large selection of olive oils, cheeses and freshly baked breads. But to me, the two real reasons to endure the crowds at Sahadi's are their spices, which are always fresh and pungent, and the homemade prepared foods. Best Buys: Ros el Hanout: This complex blend of herbs and spices is used throughout Northern Africa and the Middle East. Everyone has their own recipe, but the blend often includes coriander, paprika, turmeric, ginger, cinnamon and black pepper. (Apparently some very special versions also include hashish. Sadly, Sahadi's does not.) You can use this to flavor chicken stews or any tagine or braised dish, or sprinkle it over pork chops and peaches before grilling them. ($15 pound) Yemen Mix Spice: I asked what was in this, and the fellow who mixes it up grinned and said "A little bit of everything!" When pressed, he said it was a blend of cumin, black pepper, cloves, cardamom and turmeric. Sprinkle it on a cold chickpea salad, or dredge scallops in it before grilling them. ($8 pound) Halaby Red Pepper: This coarsely ground, brick-orange-colored pepper is more commonly known as Aleppo pepper, and it has the most amazing fragrance. I'm sitting here smelling it right now. It smells sweetly peppery like good paprika does, but with an added sharpness. It's very gently spicy, not too hot, but has a very complex, deep flavor. Aleppo peppers are native to the Syrian city of the same name, and they are sun dried before being ground. Sprinkle it on top of hummus or use it whenever you would normally use chile flakes or cayenne, but expect less heat. ($10 pound) Spicy Hummus: Sahadi's hummus is spectacularly creamy and rich. I especially like the spicy hummus, which has a nice kick that brightens the earthy chickpea-tahini flavor. ($4.95 pound) Taramasalata: This creamy salted cod roe spread is assertively briny. I love Sahadi's homemade version because you can see the little orange fish eggs; sometimes mass-produced varieties are just a mass of pink food coloring. Serve this as an appetizer with crudités and pita for dipping. ($4.25 pound) Also at the prepared foods counter, pick up an eggplant pie, which is filled with delicious stewed eggplant and red peppers inside a baked crust. ($2.75 each) Sahadi's 187 Atlantic Ave Brooklyn, NY 11201 (718) 624-4550

Dragon Fruit Season in Chinatown

POST:
 Dragon fruit are in season (somewhere!) and the street fruit vendors in Chinatown have them right now, and will have them for another six weeks or so. They're about $3.50 a pound. Dragon fruit are so gorgeous to look at that their taste can be a bit of a let down. Not that they aren't tasty—they're just a lot milder than they look. The texture is similar to a kiwi, with tiny black seeds scattered throughout white-ish flesh. It tastes like a cross between a pear and a kiwi, and is very refreshing. I like to eat mine straight, but you could certainly toss them into a fruit salad or a salsa. In assertively flavored company, they'd provide texture more than anything else. Apparently, (so the vendor tells me) they are also good for the skin. Anyone have something else you like to make with dragon fruit?

The Early Word: MaiThai 
AUTHOR:
Sarah DiGregorio
DATE:
2008-07-10 8:16:00
POST:
 MaiThai is a new addition to Brooklyn's Chinatown, which runs down 8th Avenue from about 40th to 60th Streets. As far as I know, it's the first Thai place in the neighborhood, and it's family-owned and run. The building has been totally redone, so the restaurant is quite bit sleeker than it's neighbors, with an outdoor patio and lots of floor-to-ceiling windows. I was hoping to discover the next Sripraphai—that was not happening. But MaiThai definitely shows promise, deploying vivid sweet-sour-salty flavors. We started with som tum, green papaya salad. Strewn with baby dried shrimp and doused in a fish sauce-lime-chile dressing, it was very tasty and properly made (not under-spiced for non-Thais), but nothing you haven't had before. Next we had grilled pork with dark soy-chile-shallot dipping sauce (pictured above).  Above, crispy pork with basil and chiles. This is basically deep-fried nuggets of pork belly. Sounds good, but it's actually a bit much. Plus, the crispy crust often yielded to a bite of funky pork fat, without any meat. Good for a couple bites, and not as good after that. But the sauce was delicious, with a large quantity of basil.  Above, spicy catfish with bamboo shoots and eggplant. The servers originally brought us the wrong dish before bringing this one. (I think they might be the teenage sons of the owners, and they seem less than pleased about working at the restaurant.) So they rushed to get the catfish out, and the eggplant was nearly raw and crunchy as a result. The fish bits were tiny, most the size of a quarter, and full of bones, making it difficult to eat. The sauce, though, was fantastic, with a slow, lingering burn. MaiThai 4618 8th Ave, Brooklyn (718) 438-3413

Our Man Sietsema and the World's Most Perfect Minced Meat
AUTHOR:
Sarah DiGregorio
DATE:
2008-07-9 8:40:00
POST:
 Our Man is a champion of the Muslim Bosniak fare mainly found in Queens. Now he finds himself eating the closely related food of Christian Serbs: Kafana, a restaurant that bills itself the only Serbian restaurant in the city. The cuisine here is similar to that of their Muslim neighbors, except that the Serbians are free to use pork. Thus Our Man comes face to face with what he calls the most perfect minced meat combo in the world: beef, lamb and pork. Our man also likes the bureks, or pite as they are called here. Yum! Balkan mac-and-cheese! All in all, Our Man enjoys himself here, appreciating that the food hasn't been gussied up, but is really reflective of how Serbians eat in Serbia. "When mixed with egg whites and formed into skinless sausages, it assumes the guise of cevapi ($11.95), which arrive sizzling and imbued with good smoky flavor, so pleasantly rubbery they’d bounce off the floor like superballs if you dropped them. When formed into patties, the minced meat is called pljeskavica, another main course." "A variation on this pite is definitely worth sampling: Gibanica (“Gih-bahn-eecha,” $5.45) takes the elements of a cheese burek - thin pastry sheets, feta, and egg - and mixes them so that the phyllo winds up inside the filling. This brilliant conceptual move transforms the phyllo into something like wadded noodles, and the burek thus becomes a yummy Balkan mac-and-cheese."

Fork in the Road Reviews Persimmon

DATE:

POST:
 This week, I'm reviewing Persimmon, Chef Youngsun Lee's new Korean prix-fixe spot in the East Village. Persimmon hasn't gotten much buzz for some reason; the only other review I know of is this one in New York Magazine. It's odd, because Lee is an alum of Momofuku, which couldn't be more high profile. In any case, I think it's great, and at $37 for a sprawling 5-course meal (and byob) it's a pretty good deal, too.

I disagree. Although Lee is an alum of another over-hyped dinning establishment in NYC, it does not mean that has the chops to create wouderful Lorean dishes. Our group as a whole, found them to be tasteless. The concept is good, seasonal menus with a KOrean influence in a communal setting in NYC. It simply falls short.

 Dear Democrats, It sure would be great if we managed to get Obama elected. Maybe then the world won't blow up! So, to that end, I have a suggestion. Let's not make people from parts of the country where fried chicken is like mother's milk think that we're wimpy, elitist, fried-food-phobes who don't eat anything but organic chard. Maybe you've noticed that there's a war on, and we've just lost the last two elections to the worst president ever. So, I think it's safe to say that Democrats don't have their priorities in place when the New York Times reports that no caterer wants to work at the convention because the food requirements look like they've been drafted by a Park Slope parent who forbids sugar and white flour. "A 28-page contract requested by Denver organizers that caterers provide food in 'at least three of the following five colors: red, green, yellow, blue/purple and white.' Garnishes could not be counted toward the colors. No fried foods would be allowed. Organic and locally grown foods were mandated, and each plate had to be 50 percent fruits and vegetables. As a result, caterers are shying away."

POST:
 Who: William Sullivan Where: Construction site, the Bowery and East 4th Street Occupation: Geotechnical engineer, foundation work What's the best meal you've ever eaten? That's going to be hard to say...My mom makes this chicken fricasse; she only makes it about twice a year, and when she does, she makes a lot, enough for two days. We had our big family party three weeks ago; my little sister, my nieces, my parents and I all got together and we had the chicken fricasse. What do you like about that dish? She makes it with spices and minced onion. It's a little like barbecue, it's a little sweet. And my mom always picks out the perfect chicken quarters. She marinates the chicken for 24 hours. That's the best part—when you see it marinating in the fridge, you know it's coming. And we always pick our own vegetables to go on the side, usually zucchini. We have a farm in Marbletown, New York, and I commute down here. The farm was my great-grandfather's and we've kept it in the family. What do you do? I'm 4th generation construction. My great-grandfather helped build the Brooklyn Bridge. My grandfather worked with Robert Moses. My father was an engineer, and now I do foundation work for a geotechnical firm. That's a relatively new term, it means we work with earth. What do you grow on your farm? We grow alfalfa, hay, corn for silage. It's basically used to grow feed for our neighbor's beef farm. We used to produce dairy for Dairylee, out of Boston. They'd come all the way down for our milk because they say the alfalfa that grows in the Hudson Valley makes the milk and cream sweeter. Do you like to eat out anywhere in the city? When we're working, we call any local deli for sandwiches—whichever is fastest and has the best deals. I work around here quite a bit. But I'm not a big spender in restaurants. What's for dinner tonight? Probably roast beef and potatoes. Sounds good! Will you cook it? No, my mom still likes to treat me like a baby! But I've got to water my 40 tomato plants every night when I get home. I've got all different varieties: heirlooms and beefsteaks and pear light salt cherries. My mom and dad like to have the low-salt tomatoes.

Calorie Listage Fallout

POST:
So it turns out the calorie listing laws (which will be enforced with fines starting next week) might actually be having an effect on what people order—which means it might also have an effect on what the restaurants serve. The amNY cover story this morning quotes plenty of people who have given up scones in favor of breakfast sandwiches and who are nixing burritos in favor of burrito bowls. Starbucks is the first chain to respond with new foods; they'll be rolling out healthier food options this fall. Meanwhile, at Dunkin' Donuts, it turns out that most of their (tasty) donuts are in the 200 calorie range, while their (nasty) muffins clock in at about 400. That's an excellent reason to order a donut, which is what you wanted anyway.

 For the first time ever, the Nathan's competition came down to a dog-off. After 10 minutes, Joey Chestnut (last year's champ) and Takeru "The Tsunami" Kobayashi (2001-2006 champ) were tied with 59 dogs each. So the contest went to overtime—who could put down another 5 dogs and buns the fastest? Joey Chestnut, ladies and gentlemen. Chestnut wins a year's worth of Nathan's hot dogs, $20,000 and the right to keep the mustard yellow belt. Tim "Eater X" Janus came in third, with 42 hot dogs. Highlights: A guy proposed to his shell-shocked girlfriend onstage during the pre-game show; she said yes; emcee Rich Shea then insisted that he was a reverend of the "Universal Church dot com," and mock-married them on the spot. Then Shea made them do a first dance to "Beverly Hills" by Weezer. The girlfriend looked increasingly pissed. Um, the "bunettes"...sigh. These poor girls looked like deer in the headlights, and were made to shake their high school asses to Gwen Stefani. Rich Shea fantasizing about Kobayashi "sireing a child" with Sonya Thomas. Maybe I'm easily impressed, but I thought the Skyriders, trampoline artists that performed in the pre-game, were completely amazing. Photo gallery (photos by Amol Mhatre) after the jump.

Ordering Off-Menu at Blimpie
AUTHOR:

POST:
 Any Blimpie's bland facade might be hiding unexpected goodies. There was the one on 31st Street, which evolved from a Blimpie with a Thai steam table to a full-fledged Thai restaurant, and the one on 6th Avenue at 37th Street that served Latin food like roast pork and plantains. Both of those are actually now closed, but it seems like Blimpie franchise owners are free to improvise. So when I heard about a Blimpie in the jewelry district that makes an off-menu spicy sandwich catering to the South Asian businesspeople in the neighborhood, I got right up there. Walk in and stop at the first counter, which is strictly vegetarian (the one in the back makes the meat sandwiches). Ask for the "Special Vegetarian." The counter guy will toast your roll and mound crushed nacho-flavored Doritos on the bottom half, followed by two slices of American cheese. He throws that in the microwave for a few seconds to melt the cheese. Then he piles on the standard veggies: shredded carrot, iceberg lettuce, tomato, onion, green bell peppers and pickled jalapeños. (If you want them. I think you do.) The whole thing gets salt and pepper and is then doused in a vinegary, fiery green chile chutney. It tastes good. Really good. I know the Dorito-American cheese-chile chutney might not sound like a bright idea, but trust me, it is. The place gets a steady stream of Indian customers asking for the sandwich. So next time you walk by a Blimpie, stick you head inside to make sure you're not missing anything. And email me if you find something delicious. Blimpie 29 West 46th Street (between 5th and 6th) 212-869-2189

Thks to sarah for a flattering review on blimpie's off-menu vegetarian sandwich - our infamous Nacho Cheese Sandwich. Some have even come as far as times sq & from 57th st. We not only have Indians from all over but we also have a small group of non-Indian regulars for this. Popularized by shreenath the prior owner, there are a few imitators but they can not match our fiery hot tasting chutney sauce & all the ingredients we provide. This is by no means a marketing pitch but just to say thanks to both Sarah & also Zack of www.midtownlunch.com who linked up his site to Sarah's review. Enjoy!

Haha that's great! I never knew about this, and I am quite the Blimpie fan. I like how each location is just a little bit different. I might go to the original Blimpie in Hoboken today for lunch, now that I'm inspired.

 You can check out my profile of Eater X and Crazy Legs Conti here. And today there's more breaking eating news, so let's get to it, shall we? Badlands Booker—eater, 7 train conductor and hip hop artist with albums such as Hungry and Focused: The Ingestion Engine—is apparently coming out of retirement for tomorrow's big day. He won a qualifying contest (one of the last available) this past weekend, eating 27.5 dogs in 10 minutes. [amNY] And Gersh Kuntzman, at the Brooklyn Paper, is all hot under the collar about the fact that Kobayashi is being allowed to compete tomorrow without having won a qualifier. He's getting a "sponsor's exemption" claims the IFOCE. Kuntzman is not having it. Yowza! Check back here tomorrow for all the hot dog coverage you can stand. I might be willing to stomach the idea of a sponsor’s exemption under normal circumstances — but Kobayashi’s very ability to eat is under such a cloud that he might not even be worthy of being at the table at all this year.

 Our Man enjoys puns. Maybe you've noticed this. In an Our Man column, you are almost guaranteed at least one pun. This week, he's cruising over the Queensboro bridge and taking illegal left turns (gasp!) to get to a Lebanese barbecue joint, Cedars. And Our Man crowns it a great find (he was tipped off my someone named Gerard, who periodically sends him envelopes stuffed with take-out menus). There are great savory pies and breads, or sandwiches stuffed with good things like fried cauliflower or fried eggplant. But the real draw is the array of grilled meats. And then there is the Makanek sausage, made of lamb and red wine. And if you don't like it, Our Man reminds us, we can always get it to fix our car. Bum dum bum. There are long ground-beef kufta kebabs shining moistly on their swords, which give them the air of medieval armaments that have just been removed from tender flesh. Regular kufta comes ramified with parsley and onions, which complement the smoky flavor.

 This week, check out the feature on Crazy Legs and Eater X, competitive eaters and roommates. I followed them as they prepared for the Nathan's Famous hot dog eating contest. Check back here on Friday for pictures of the contest and an update on how Crazy Legs and Eater X fared at the Superbowl of eating. And in the Eats section, I check out The Rusty Knot. And discover that it's very overrated. If you want to go to a kitschy maritime bar, why not go to a real one, like the Ear Inn or Montero's?

In Defence of the Fancy Food Show
AUTHOR:
Sarah DiGregorio
DATE:
2008-07-1 11:00:00
POST:
 The Fancy Food Show is not very cool. It's huge, feels corporate, and there are plenty of large, industrial food companies in attendance. But it's also a place where you can talk to pickle makers from Texas, paté makers from Wales, and the guy who runs America's last remaining stone-ground mustard mill. If you take the time to walk around, you'll find plenty of small, family-owned food businesses, run by people who launched their companies against the financial odds, and who are just trying to get their product out there. That's why Grub Street's interview with Tom Mylan of Diner and Marlow & Sons grated on me. Mylan founded the "Unfancy Food Show," showcasing local, artisanal products. Great, the more food, the merrier. But is it really necessary to go on, as Mylan did, about what a "joke" the Fancy Food Show is? Yes, the UnFancy Food show is much hipper, we get it. I'm so tired of food people having to one up each other about who is the most profoundly artisanal. So to prove that the Fancy Food Show is not worthy of our scorn, here are my picks for the most interesting finds there. Elephant Pepper makes hot sauces and dry spice rubs from African birds eye chiles. The sauces are delicious, not overwhelmingly hot, but very flavorful. The company, based out of Zambia, helps rural villages develop a chile crop, which not only ends up being a source of income (Elephant Pepper buys the harvested chiles and makes them into the hot sauce) but also reduces conflict between elephants and people. Elephants often eat farmers' crops, but it turns out that they hate chiles. By planting chiles as a barrier around other crops, the farmers can deter elephants without harming them. Buy the hot sauce because it's good, but also because the profits are going to protect the elephant population as well as spur economic growth in rural Africa. Super Mole, a ready-made mole poblano paste from Mexico, has a dark, nutty savor. It's deep and rich, and tastes very close to homemade. Just add water or stock and pinches of salt and sugar to taste. Patchwork patés are maybe the best store-bought patés I have ever had. The recipes come from Margaret Carter, a Welsh mother who started shopping her patés around to local cafés in 1982. Now the spreads are available at Fairway, and online at igourmet. My favorites are the Welsh Dragon (venison liver-chile) and chicken liver-brandy-herb. Chocolate Grove, a Australian chocolate company, has just introduced a line of chocolates flavored with native Australian herbs, like pungent lemon myrtle and coffee-like wattleseed. Flippin' Pickles (no website) is a new pickle company from Texas. I loved their chow chow (Southern-style pickle relish) and their crunchy pickles, studded with slices of garlic.

Recipe Improv with Alexandra Guarnaschelli
AUTHOR:
Sarah DiGregorio
DATE:

POST:
 Today, we’re playing Recipe Improv with Alexandra Guarnaschelli, executive chef at Butter restaurant. We thought of her this week because her new show, The Cooking Loft, debuts this Saturday at 9:30am on the Food Network. It will be a technique-driven, cooking-class-like show, with an actual chef, which is exactly what the Food Network should be showing more often. Before moving to Butter in 2003, Guarnaschelli had worked under Larry Forgione, attended the La Varenne Culinary School in Burgundy and been the sous chef at Daniel. The mystery ingredients: Oxtail, cardamom, heirloom tomatoes We chose heirloom tomatoes because they’re in season, and also because Guarnaschelli’s first show this Saturday will be all about cooking with fresh tomatoes. This is the kind of dish that straddles summer and fall. Braised Oxtail with Cardamom and Roasted Heirloom Tomatoes Serves 4 1 tablespoon ground cumin 15 cardamom pods, pods removed, seeds reserved 4 1/2 pounds oxtail, cut into 11/2-inch rounds kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 1/2 cup vegetable oil 1 small bunch fresh thyme 1 medium yellow onion, sliced 1 carrot, sliced 1 green apple, sliced 2 stalks celery, sliced 5 shallots, peeled and sliced 3 cloves garlic, split 1 bottle red wine, preferably a Merlot or Cabernet Sauvignon 4 quarts beef stock, or enough to cover the meat 1 bay leaf 4 pints heirloom cherry tomatoes 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil 1 tablespoon powdered sugar zest from 1/2 an orange Roast the oxtails: Preheat the oven to 350 F. In a dry skillet over medium heat, toast the cumin and cardamom seeds until just fragrant and reserve. Season the oxtail with salt and pepper and sprinkle liberally with the toasted spices. In a large skillet over medium heat, warm vegetable oil until it smokes lightly. Working in batches if necessary, place the meat in the oil and brown on all sides. Remove meat to a roasting pan, and season again with salt and pepper. In the pan in which the meat was browned, add the thyme, onion, carrot and apple, and stir to combine, and scrape up any browned bits, maintaining medium heat. Season with salt and pepper, and cook, 3 to 4 minutes, until vegetables are tender. Add celery, shallots and garlic, and cook 3 minutes more. Set aside. Place the roasting pan containing the oxtails over medium heat, and add the red wine. Reduce the wine until all of the liquid has cooked out and pan is almost dry. Add the beef stock, the sautéed vegetables, and bay leaf. Cover with foil, and cook in the oven, undisturbed, for 2 1/2 to 3 hours, or until the meat is tender. Once cooked, remove the pan from the oven. Remove the meat to a cooling rack and strain the vegetables, reserving both the vegetables and the liquid, separately. Make the sauce: In a saucepan, bring the cooking liquid to a simmer, and reduce until it coats the back of a spoon. If the sauce is not thick enough, you can puree some of the cooked vegetables until smooth and add to the sauce. Set sauce aside, and keep warm. At this point, you can discard the cooked vegetables. Roast the tomatoes: Toss tomatoes with olive oil, salt, pepper and powdered sugar, and arrange on a baking sheet. Roast tomatoes in the oven for 10 minutes, or until tender. Remove, sprinkle with orange zest and let cool slightly. To serve: Gently re-heat the oxtails in the sauce. Arrange the tomatoes on the bottom of a platter and top with oxtails and sauce. Serve.

The Great Sirloin Taste-Off
AUTHOR:
Sarah DiGregorio
DATE:

POST:
 Lately, Whole Foods has been trying (and pretty much failing) to prove that it is a budget-friendly place to shop. But the majority of the items at Whole Foods can be found cheaper elsewhere—but I still shop there occasionally, mostly for meat and fish. And not just because the goods are from more humane or environmentally-friendly sources (although that's part of it). I perceive Whole Foods' (and to some extent Fairway's) meat and fish as higher quality and tastier. When I trek off to get my meat from Whole Foods, am I just getting sucked in by their slick marketing? It made me wonder how much the setting in which we buy something influences how we think it tastes, later. Maybe the meat in my grubby local Associated is just as good as that at Whole Foods or Fairway, but I'm just not perceiving it that way. So I set up a blind taste test with four sirloin steaks from different grocery stores. I chose sirloin because it's common, and because the meat is relatively lean, it doesn't have a lot of delicious fat to hide behind, making it easier to tell which ones are really tasty. Our criteria: - Clean, robust, beefy taste - Juicy, appetizing texture, not gristly - Visual appeal The contestants: Associated (5th Avenue, Brooklyn), $6.99 pound C-Town( 9th Street, Brooklyn), $4.99 pound Fairway (Red Hook), $8.99 pound Whole Foods (Union Square) $9.99 pound I seasoned each one of them with 1/4 teaspoon of salt, and roasted them all in the same oven, on the same sheet pans, at 450 degrees. The Associated steak was cut super-thin, so I took that one out after 6 minutes. The others roasted for 11 minutes, until medium-rare. They all rested for 5 minutes. A team of tasters came over, and with bottles of wine and Obama on the television, we started eating. Each steak was labeled with a letter A-D, so that we could keep them straight without knowing where they were from. The results, winner first: 1. Whole Foods Yes, this was the runaway winner, unanimously. I was actually hoping it would be one of the underdogs, but the WF sirloin was absolutely, far and away the best, cut nicely for the most visual appeal, with a very clean, strong beefy flavor. It was juicy, had a texture that fell nicely between tender and pleasantly chewy, and no gristle. "This is so good it doesn't need anything but salt and pepper," said one taster. "Even the fat tastes good," said another. No contest. 2. Fairway The second and third place winners were pretty close, but Fairway came out slightly ahead. It was definitely the chewiest and leanest of the lot, but the robust taste made up for that—savory, salty (even though it had the same amount of added salt as the others) with a very clean, mineral flavor. 3. C-Town: Best Value This steak was only $4.99 a pound, and it gave Fairway's higher-priced version a run for its money. It was very juicy, had an appetizing aroma, and was "chewy and sweet." It tasted like a good, everyday piece of meat. One taster said that it reminded him of the steaks he grew up on. 4. Associated Surprisingly, this was not the cheapest of the bunch, although the particular supermarket is the most down-market of the group. It was definitely not worth $6.99 a pound. The ever-cheerful tasters tried to make the best of it: "It might make a good sandwich," said one. "Or a Chinese stir fry," suggested another. But after chewing for a while, we decided it tasted overwhelmingly livery, "a little dirty, "with a "smudgey aftertaste." "Could this be from some animal other than cow?" one taster asked. Mmmmm. So there you have it. If sirloin is a good bellwether, Whole Paycheck's meat really might be worth the price. But C-Town wins on value.

One of Clo's Enomatics Clo, the new wine bar in the Time Warner Center, is a sleek box of a space, the walls lined with banks of Enomatics—the Italian contraption that preserves open wine bottles with inert gas, and also automatically dispenses a pre-programmed amount of the wine into your glass. Union Square Wines has a few of the machines, but you have to buy a bottle first in order to use them, and the setting isn't appealing for meeting a friend for wine tasting. Clo, on the other hand, isn't selling bottles (yet) so the 106 wines sealed up in the Enomatics are just for tasting. One long table dominates the small space, and the surface of the table displays the much talked about automated wine list. You can search by color, grape, region or price, and each bottle lists its basic biographical information, as well as tasting notes and a map showing which Enomatic you can find it in. I thought that navigating the system was awkward, and involved a lot of waving my hands in the air like a crazy person (and I wasn't even tipsy!). But it is an undeniably cool feature, once you get the hang of it. The table-top computerized wine list The tastes dispensed at the Enomatics are two ounces (that's a little less than half a glass), and most cost between $4-12. The cheapest is $3 and the most expensive $83. Beyond the cool gadgetry and novelty factor, Clo's best feature is that it puts a taste of some very expensive wines within almost anyone's reach. Yes, $30 for two ounces of wine is very expensive, but it's more attainable than buying a bottle of 1991 Chateau Musar for hundreds and hundreds of dollars. Wine geeks on a budget will love this place. And it has fairly comfy stools and a view out over the Time Warner Center's atrium into Central Park—a fun new place to meet friends for a drink, with the added benefit of being able to taste a bunch of different wines.

we went to the wine bar clo, and it was a really interesting experience! definitely worth bringing your friends to for an after work wine tasting. I sometimes order "wrong" wine and are forced to finish it, here you can pour yourself and change if you don't like it. ;-)

POST:
 Years ago, there was an article in Saveur about the amazing food to be found at 7-Eleven franchises in Taiwan—each owner runs his or her own food program, featuring snacks like dumplings and octopus balls, and even elaborate New Year's meals to carry out. Imagine picking up a home-cooked holiday dinner at 7-Eleven. Our 7-Elevens don't measure up, but every now and then I walk into a bodega or convenience store to get a bottle of water or a six-pack of beer, and run into a counter selling some improbably good, homemade food. One of my favorites is Pak Punjab Deli and Grocery (50 E.3rd St). The owner there is from the Pakistani side of the Punjab, and the heavy, meaty kabobs, snacks and curries are from that region. Is it the best Punjabi food ever? Definitely not—but the prices are hard to beat ($2-$4 per item) and I like the down-home, friendly vibe. Their chicken chapali—basically a spiced, ground meat patty—is delicious, patted out so that's thin and floppy, and then browned on a griddle. It's intensely garlicky. The chicken tikka kabobs are also good, as is the spicy fried fish, (both pictured below) but skip the bland chaat.  In Brooklyn, El Centenario Grocery and Deli (687 5th Avenue, Brooklyn) is a Mexican bodega that has a few tables and a food counter in back. The goat tacos are some of the best in the city; the chicken-mole poblano tamales are reliably good, as are the huitlachoche quesadillas. Really, I've never been disappointed with anything I've eaten here. Possibly because of the way the neighborhood is gentrifying, El Centanario seems to be shifting more toward food service and away from bodega-dom. I went in today, and found that several of the grocery shelves had been taken out in favor of more seating. Whatever, with goat tacos like these, they could put in a disco ball and I'd still go. Anybody know of other good convenience store eats?

I'm not sure I agree with this post on El Centanario. I stopped by here on a whim and got a variety of Mexican treats. I was mostly disappointed, though. It was all pretty greasy, though the people serving it were very nice. I think the tacos at Tacos Neuvo Mexico a few blocks up 5th Ave is far better, though. Or Rico Tacos down 5th on 54th.

 La Bergamote's Quiche Lorraine

POST:
 In this week's dining newsletter, Hailey Eber talked to La Bergamote's pastry chef, Stephane Willemin. La Bergamote just opened a new location in midtown at 515 West 52nd Street, where the menu has expanded—adding savory treats like salads and tartines to the pastries the bakery is known for at the Chelsea location. And since it's almost fall-like outside, and you might not mind turning on your oven for the first time in months, why not mix up Willemin's hearty quiche Lorraine at home? Quiche Lorraine Yield: 1 10-inch quiche For the dough: 1 pound flour 8 ounces cold butter, diced pinch of salt 4 ounces cold water For the filling: 4 eggs salt and pepper to taste 2 cups milk 2 cups heavy cream 1/2 cup shredded Swiss cheese 4 ounces bacon, diced Prepare the dough: In a bowl, combine flour, butter and salt, using a fork or your hands to work the butter into the flour until a sandy consistency is reached, with tiny bits of butter distributed throughout the flour. Gently work in the water to form dough. Store in the refrigerator until chilled, or overnight. Roll out the dough, and place in 10-inch pie plate, pressing dough firmly along the sides of the pie plate. Using a fork, prick a few holes through the dough on the bottom of the plate. Freeze for one hour. Meanwhile, In a bowl, beat the eggs with salt and pepper, and then stir in the milk and cream. Set aside. Preheat oven to 450. Remove pie plate from the freezer, lay parchment paper over the dough, and weigh it down with uncooked rice or uncooked dried beans. This will help keep the dough from rising and bubbling up while it cooks. Bake the dough for 12 to 15 minutes, until sides are beginning to brown. Remove pie shell from oven, and discard parchment paper and rice or beans. Bake pie shell an additional 3 to 4 minutes, and remove from oven. Reduce oven heat to 375. In a frying pan, sauté the bacon, then strew it along the pie shell bottom. Add the egg and milk mixture, and scatter the Swiss cheese around the pie. Bake quiche in oven for 20 to 25 minutes, or until top is brown and mixture is set. Serve warm with a side salad. Note: you can easily substitute spinach, broccoli, onions or leeks forthe bacon; pre-cook the vegetables a bit in hot water to soften them before adding to quiche mixture.

Our Man Sietsema and the Greek Vacation on Acid
AUTHOR:

POST:
 This week, Our Man Sietsema is happy to find Yiasou, a Greek spot in Sheepshead Bay that imitates those 'estiatorio' places in midtown where you pay a huge sum to have a whole fresh fish grilled for you. Yiasou offers all sorts of sea creatures that you can choose from, but it does it at about half the price. But there's other good stuff, too—Our Man finds plenty to occupy himself: TMI! Moving on. The only items here that Our Man really doesn't like are the salads. He likes the octopus appetizer, and he doesn't mind the Italian-influenced dishes that sneak on the menu, like Sicilian-style baked clams. But really, it's the fish that he's after. Anything labeled "skordalia" is totally dope: This mash of potatoes with olive oil, lemon juice, and raw garlic will set your mouth on fire. You can get it plain ($5.50), heaped up in a craggy Olympus surrounded by triangles of toasted pita. Even better is pantzaria ($7), an equivalent quantity of skordalia hemmed in with lightly pickled beets (which offers the added advantage of turning your urine bright red a few hours later). Insist that the old man accompany you to the iced display and show you his stuff....The branzino ($20 per pound, one pound average) is the best deal of all, black-striped from the grill, with gobbets of smoky flesh easily pulling away from the largish bones...Gleaming blue and silver, these beautiful sardines were big and sweet-fleshed. And cheap, too: At $20 for eight (representing one pound), they easily satisfied our crew of four.

Fork in the Road reviews Macondo
AUTHOR:
Sarah DiGregorio
DATE:

POST:
 Since I wrote about "real" Latin street food in Sunset Park last week, this week I thought it would be interesting to review Macondo, a new, upscale, pan-Latin street food spot on the LES. Obviously, there's no comparison, and I'll always prefer the curbside taco trucks to a slick place like Macondo. But although Macondo stumbles in some places, there are some really great things to eat there: The mofongo, for one, is ridiculously tasty, garlicky and garnished with fat rods of fried pork belly. Polenta with chorizo and a fried egg is also spectacular. The menu is divided into categories like tacos, empanadas, arepas, etc. While not everything is as fantastic as the mofongo, much of it is solid. And there is a novelty factor in seeing what an indoor, gussied-up restaurant can do with items like arepa—the corn cakes come with elaborate toppers like bacalao and a fried egg, or quail. Strangely, Macondo is best when playing with rich flavors, and salsa is nowhere to be found. Too bad, because that's exactly what the dry shrimp tacos needed. And then there are some small annoyances—in what seems to me a cynical move, the (delicious) cocktails are "tapas-style," meaning you'll be paying $7.50 for a tiny glass, about half of a regular cocktail. And the servers have obviously been instructed to give 10-minute speeches about the menu, which is full of things like tacos and empanadas and does not need explaining. This is a fun place that shouldn't be taken too seriously—go with a group and share a bunch of things, and get whoever makes the most money pay for the drinks.

Restaurant Opening Delays and Experimental Ramen
AUTHOR:

POST:
 I was craving a burger so we stopped by the East Village's new Black Iron Burger, which reportedly opened Monday. Sadly, the place in a bit of disarray and the owner was standing at the door, saying the place will be open tomorrow. (I'll check it out soon, although I'm a tad skeptical that the place's $8,000 Keating Miraclean will produce a better burger than a well-seasoned griddle.) On the way over, we had passed Kurve, which had white paper plastered over all its windows—to keep out the sun, or has it "closed" again? (Check out my column next week for more on this fiasco.) A bill from Anheuser-Busch been slipped under the door. This place is definitely on hospice. Exhausted just thinking about the complications involved in opening a New York restaurant—especially now, when the blogs are reporting your every move— and denied a burger, my co-worker and I decided on the next best thing, which is obviously ramen. Black Iron Burger is on the same block as Minca, one of the best ramen spots in the Village. I ordered the "experimental ramen," which as far as I can tell, is a big bowl of whatever the chef feels like making. I think it's usually a good idea to put yourself at the mercy of the guy doing the cooking. This bowl featured milky-colored pork bone broth, pickled ginger, bamboo, deliciously slippery slices of pork, a soy-marinated hard boiled egg and black mushroom. What would you put in your experimental ramen? Mine would be the bastard child of Indian papri chaat and pork broth ramen.

The Olympics are over, so let's ring them out in style with New York's most flamboyant competitive eater, Crazy Legs Conti, shown here eating Michael Phelp's typical breakfast in 5 minutes. Yes, we're all a little tired of hearing about the quantities America's freakiest Olympian eats, but this video puts a worthy cap on a news story that ended up absolutely everywhere. Three pancakes, three french toasts, three fried egg sandwiches, a bowl of grits, an omelet and two cups of coffee—down the hatch in 5 minutes. Bonus: Crazy Legs does it wearing swimming goggles, and no shirt, so you can watch his stomach expand in Olympian fashion. See more funny videos and funny pictures at CollegeHumor.

 What's For Dinner? In which we stop random New Yorkers on the street, and ask them about their food lives. Who: Abu Khan Age: 44 Occupation: Fruit cart owner Where: Astor Place and Lafayette What's the best meal you've ever had? My best meal is rice and vegetables. My wife cooks it. When I get home, she fixes the dining room table, and we eat, and watch TV for one and a half, maybe sometimes two hours and then go to bed. What kind of vegetables does she use and how does she season them? Potatoes, eggplant, broccoli, cauliflower, carrot...I like mixed vegetables! And she uses chiles, mustard seeds and cooks in soy bean oil and mustard oil. Of fruits, though, I like mango the best. Are you vegetarian? No! I like beef too much! My wife says I like it too much and my cholesterol is high, so she says 'No, I won't give it to you!' What's for dinner tonight? I'm not sure what she's cooking right now. Maybe something special because it's my son's birthday. Maybe biryani, and some spicy beef. Maybe today she'll give it to me. Where are you from originally? Bangladesh. Are there any foods you don't like? Actually, you know, I don't like fish. My wife and I fight about it all the time. She likes it. I don't like any kind of fish. In my country, we love fish, but with me, it is different. Are there any restaurants you like in New York? Sometimes, we go especially to an Indian restaurant in Jackson Heights, but mostly we eat at home. Where do you like to go in Jackson Heights and what do you order? Hut Bazaar, I think it is called. I get biryani.

 Today, we're playing Recipe Improv with Lon Symensma, the executive chef at Buddakan. Symensma trained extensively in Asia and Europe, and has worked under Jean-Georges Vongerichten at both Jean-Georges and Spice Market. The mystery ingredients: Root beer, beets, shiso Chef Symensma came up with a twist on the Dark and Stormy, using the traditional lime juice and rum, but subbing in root beer for ginger beer, adding ginger juice, beet juice and shiso leaves. Drink up, summer’s almost over. Dark and Stormy Yield: 1 cocktail 3 tablespoons beet juice 1 tablespoons ginger juice 1/2 teaspoon of salt 2 shiso leaves, roughly chopped 2 tablespoons lime juice 1 (12-ounce) can root beer 1 1/2 ounce shot of rum In a small pot, combine the beet juice, ginger juice and salt, and bring to a boil. Add the shiso leaves, and reduce heat to a simmer. Cook for 4 to 5 minutes. Remove pot from heat, and allow mixture to chill in the refrigerator until cold. Once cold, stir in the lime juice. To serve, combine the beet-ginger mixture with the can of root beer and a shot of rum, and serve over ice.

 When the email from Our Man Sietsema popped into my box bearing the subject line "Edible Eyes," I thought there were various scenarios possible. Perhaps he's found a restaurant where the eyeballs are particularly tasty? Given Our Man Sietsema's culinary leanings, they would most likely be goat or lamb eyeballs... I clicked, with some trepidation. But it turned out to be this link, to quite possibly the most amazing recipe of all time, for completely edible googly eyes. And there's instructions on how to use them to make this unlovely fellow, pictured above, who is called the Flying Spaghetti Monster, natch. Well I know what I'm doing Friday night!

 What's For Dinner? In which we stop random New Yorkers on the street and ask them about their food lives. Who: Rochelle Farley Where: Corner of Broadway and 8th Street, buying fruit from a stand Occupation: Home health aide Rochelle didn't want me to take her picture, but she is a very petite, pretty, dark-skinned woman, with her hair in a sleek, short bob. Today she was wearing a fitted striped teeshirt. What's your best food memory? In Guyana, where I'm from, we have six different races, so we have many different varieties of food: Indian, Chinese, African...My favorite dish is something we call lo mein, but you would call it chow mein. It's like chow mein, but different—it's not as wet. We take chicken, green peas, corn and long beans and fry them up. When they're cooked, you add the chow mein noodles and toss. I can't find it here, so for me to get it, I have to cook it myself. That's as healthy as I get! Do you get to go back to Guyana often? I try to go once a year. What kind of fruit did you just buy? Because of the season, peaches, nectarine and strawberries. But back home, my favorite fruit is mango. What's for dinner tonight? Oh, I don't eat! I don't have time. I take care of an elderly lady here, and I live in the Bronx. I leave at six in the morning and get home at eight. But you must eat something! It depends what time I get home. If I get in early, I have me a cup of tea and a slice of bread and cheese. That's it. In the morning, I have a can of Ensure on the way to work. Then when I get here, I have tea and a roll. That carries me till lunch. Sometimes for lunch, I get junk. French fries, chicken wings, chicken sandwich...Salads and stuff like that I stay away from. No health food.

Hydrox are Dead. Long Live Hydrox.

POST:
 In 1908, the Sunshine Biscuit Company dreamed up the chocolate sandwich cookie, and named the creation Hydrox. Four years later, an identical cookie debuted—Oreos had better marketing, and Hydrox never really caught up. Kim Burton, of Wichita, Kansas grew up eating only Hydrox and started a fan site in 1998, encouraging people to buy Hydrox rather than Oreos. When the cookies disappeared for good in 2003, the site became a kind of memorial, with hundreds of readers agitating for the cookies’ reincarnation. (This is a tradition now. Google Jello Pudding Pops.) But tomorrow, Kellogg (which owns everything that Kraft doesn’t) is bringing the cookies back, for a limited time. They'll be hitting store shelves at Target, ShopRite, Pathmark, Weis and others at the end of this week. Plus—free food alert—Big Daddy's Diner will be giving out free Hydrox cookies with every order after 2pm tomorrow. Kellogg actually flew Burton out to New York for the party. She's going to be ringing the closing bell at the stock exchange and appearing on the CBS Early Show—all because she started a blog in defense of Hydrox. We caught up with Burton today, just after she flew in. Is now a good time to talk? I'm in a a van right now, we're on our way to PR firm, but the traffic here…it’s not like we’re going anywhere. Yes, it’s crazy. What do you love about Hydrox? How are they different from Oreos? Well they taste better. They’re not quite as sweet. Oreos taste kind of chemically. Hyrox are subtler, and you can taste the chocolate in the cookie part. You know—I’m sure most people don’t think quite so much about this, but—some cookies invest too much effort in the frosting. So you know, when you twist open the cookie and lick off the frosting, the cookie part you’re left with is like sand. Have you had one of the new Hydrox cookies yet? I’ve tasted the new cookies; they sent me samples. The official tasting is tomorrow, but they sent me a sample pack. I mean… it’s hard to really remember when it’s been a decade since you’ve had something. I ate the whole pack, and thought they were great and pretty much like I remembered. They say they’ve used the original formula, the only difference is that I think they had to make them trans fat free. And from what I tasted, I totally believe they used the original recipe. What if they hadn’t tasted right? Could you have said something? Well, I was totally happy. But no, they didn’t really ask. But honestly, it’s funny because there have been so many fans writing in on the website who are concerned that the company will mess with the recipe. That was a really huge thing, and people have been leaving comments on the site. They’re really concerned! Where do you want to eat while you’re in town? Besides cookies…I ate pizza today for lunch and that was one of my goals. And cheesecake is a big thing, too, right? Did the pizza live up to the hype? It was a little greasy— I liked the crust, it was very crispy. But that was only one place, and I know New York pizza is a large category. Any Wichita, Kansas recommendations? There’s a bistro called Kelsey’s that we love to go to, it’s got the best prime rib. We’re total beef people. Sabor, a little Latin restaurant, just opened downtown, and we really liked it. Good mojitos!

Hydrox cookies cannot be easily located in greater Los Angeles. I suspect people have snapped up the few extant bags for resale at a collector's markup.

POST:
 Perhaps some of you got New York Bites in your mailbox this morning—that's the Voice's dining newsletter written by the lovely and clever Hailey Eber. If not, click here, and sign up tout de suite. In any case, Hailey recently talked to Forge chef Marc Forgione and got his recipe for a simple tomato sauce that can be served with roast chicken, or pretty much any hunk o'meat you've thrown on the grill. Quick Tomato Sauce Yield: About 3 1/2 cups 2 tablespoons ginger juice 5 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil 1 clove garlic, minced 1/2 red onion, choppped 2 tablespoons Thai basil, finely chopped 1 tablespoon mint, finely choppped 2 pints cherry tomatoes, chopped 2 tablespoons coriander seed 1 teaspoon sherry vinegar 1 teaspoon salt 1 teaspoon pepper Combine all ingredients in a bowl, and mix, adding additional salt or pepper to taste. Let sit covered for 4 hours. Serve over a roast chicken or other meat.

Our Man Sietsema and the Peasant Lard

POST:
 This week, Our Man Sietsema eats at Karczma, a new, slightly upscale Polish eatery in Greenpoint, and discovers that the peasant lard contains no actual fat from the underclasses. Nevertheless, he liked the melty, bacon-studded lard, served with rye: Despite the lard, Karczma is apparently trying to give Polish food a healthy make-over, an effort Our Man does not wholeheartedly support, calling boneless, skinless chicken breast "the world's most unpromising ingredient." (We could not agree more) But Our Man roots out the good stuff, as he always does. He loves the grilled fresh ham, and finds a servicable beef goulash. And the place is a good value: Ah, yes, lovers of sheer volume. We count ourselves among them. But once we tried it, we were hooked, especially after recalling the recently revealed scientific fact that lard has half the saturated fat of butter. "Eat Healthy—Eat Lard" is our new slogan. Once again, lovers of sheer volume will find much to like on the entrée menu. Special meat selections for two ($22) or four ($31) are so abundant, they really feed three or six. These come with big bowls of roasted potatoes and pork-flecked sauerkraut...

Fork in the Road finds Sunset Park's Best Street Food
AUTHOR:
Sarah DiGregorio
DATE:
2008-08-20 9:26:00
POST:
 This week, my column treks through Sunset Park, a Latin American neighborhood in Brooklyn. I found that the best street carts and taco trucks come out at night (and often work their griddles until dawn). My favorite was Yissel's chimichurri truck, where you can get Dominican chimichurris, the awesome, messy, hamburgers stuffed in a bun with lightly pickled cabbage and tons of mayo and hot sauce. Yissel also makes a fantastic suadero taco, superior tostones and fried, garlicky sausages. Her mother is Mexican and her father is Dominican, so the food at her truck runs toward both countries. Then there's Tacos el Bronco, which is a masterpiece of space efficiency. It's just a tiny, silver cart and somehow it holds three cooks, two griddles and two chopping blocks. They only serve tacos, but there are seven options, and they're all great (except the dryish chicken). Try the chorizo and the tripe. There are two other great street food spots in the story, but you'll have to click the clicker and read it to find out about those. If you go, do keep in mind that the hours the trucks and carts keep can be variable. I found Yissel's truck to be the most consistent. Other places would tell me in no uncertain terms that they're there everyday after 4pm, say, and occasionally that wouldn't be the case. But it's street food—the unpredictability is part of its charm.

The Taste of Childhood?
AUTHOR:
Sarah DiGregorio
DATE:
2008-08-19 17:19:00
POST:
On last night's (slightly over-excited) No Reservations: Spain, Anthony Bourdain came to the conclusion that many chefs are sentimentalists, forever chasing the flavors of their childhoods. He asked one chef, "What's the taste of your childhood?" and the chef replied that it was lamb, grilled over a fire. Just then, a hunk of grilled beef playfully colored to look like charcoal came out of his kitchen. So there you have it. Obviously the question is sentimental, easily made light of. But I thought about it, and if I had to nail it down to one taste, I think it would be the potato kugel from Recipes for a Small Planet that my mother used to make. What's yours? What one dish or flavor zaps you back to your childhood? And do you make yourself it now? Here's the recipe for the potato kugel (which bears little resemblance to a noodle kugel). I haven't ever made it as an adult. Too much grating. Potato Kugel From Recipes for a Small Planet Yield: about 15 squares 6 average potatoes 2-3 carrots 1 big onion 1 clove garlic, minced 2 eggs, beaten 3 tablespoons oil 2 teaspoons salt 1/4 cup whole grain bread crumbs 2 cups yogurt, plus extra for serving 1/3 cup grated cheese [Parmesan, I think] Grate the potatoes, carrots and onion into a large bowl. Drain off the liquid that will accumulate around the edges of the mixture before going on. Stir in all the remaining ingredients except the grated cheese. Oil a 7-inch-by-11-inch or a 9-inch-by-9-inch pan. Spread the mixture evenly into the pan. Place the pan into a 350-degree oven for 40 minutes to an hour. When the kugel is nearly done, it will test dry, like a cake, the edges should be brown, and it will smell delicious. Before you remove it from the oven, add the grated cheese over the top, and leave it in the oven 5 more minutes, or until the cheese is melted. Serve either hot or cold, with additional yogurt if desired.

I'm Filipino and I get instantly transported back to childhood whenever I taste adobo chicken. I would eat the chicken with its thickened soy sauce/vinegar/garlic/black pepper/chili peppers sauce poured over steamed white rice. Yummmm! I still make adobo chicken but because of my family's health problems, we have the dish occasionally and with skinless chicken breasts and drumsticks. Sadly, it just doesn't taste the same as the adobo chicken of my childhood :(

As a boy in Argentina, I grew to love a dish called bistec a caballo - a thin steak topped with a fried egg and served over white rice. Oh joy. That's my childhood dish. Have not had it since I was a tween and probably never will again. I'm now vegetarian/alkaline oriented. But point me toward an Indian restaurant today and I'm in heaven.

Anti-Energy Drink Comes to NYC

POST:
 Some of you got kind of, um, excited the last time I posted about Drank, the "anti-energy" drink that claims to "slow your roll." Because I am so deeply uncool, a commenter had to let me on the implicit model for the stuff: Okay, but the press release says: Every aspect of this calming drink was inspired by today’s popular hip hop artists who embrace the much sought-after hip hop lifestyle that encourages people to capture a stress-free state of mind. So what they mean by "stress-free state of mind" is actually a "codine stupor." Excellent. Well, I don't know if the melatonin, valerian root and rose hips in the convenience store-version of Drank is really going to do that for you, but now you can find out yourself. As of Wednesday, you'll be able to find Drank in convenience stores in Manhattan and the Bronx. It's being distributed by Good O Beverage Company, which is headquartered in the Bronx. Carry on. "purple drank," a.k.a. Sprite with prescription cough syrup containing promethazine and codeine. It was popularized by Houston's DJ Screw, who happened to die from OD'ing on the stuff, and is very popular in the hip hop community in the south.

Whither the Old-School French Restaurant?
AUTHOR:
Sarah DiGregorio
DATE:
2008-08-18 13:10:00
POST:
 One of my first articles for the Voice was on some of the decades-old midtown French restaurants that are still hanging on by their fingertips. These are places that have been around since Hell's Kitchen was a little France, most opening in the 1930s and 1940s. Notably, there's Le Veau d'Or, Tout Va Bien (my favorite), Chez Napoléon and La Grenouille. When I was doing research and reporting for the story, two places didn't make it into the final draft just for space reasons: Le Biarritz on 57th Street and Rene Pujol Restaurant Français on 51st Street. Now, just in the last couple months, both places have closed. It makes me wonder how long the other places will be able to stay open, especially in this economic downturn. Obviously, openings and closings are just a natural part of the restaurant world. But there is something wonderfully eccentric and unfashionable about these old French spots. And some of the food is so meticulously prepared and so straight-ahead delicious it makes you realize what you've been missing while eating at trendy new restaurants. When was the last time you had cherries jubilee? Do you remember how boozy and sublime cherries jubilee is, with its hot brandy, half-melted vanilla ice cream and sweet cherries? I suggest you run over to Chez Napoléon for a version that's theatrically flamed table side. But do it soon, before cook Marguerite Bruno (86 years-old) retires, or the Bruno family loses the lease, as they are likely to in 2010. Not only do they (mostly) serve great food, many of these restaurants are living time capsules that remind us of what was essentially the birth of modern New York restaurants—the 1939 New York World's Fair, where a cook named Henri Soulé ran a restaurant in the French Pavilion. The next year, Soulé opened Le Pavillion on East 55th, hiring fellow French immigrants, and later La Cote Basque. Alums from his restaurants went on to populate New York with their own French eateries. In fact, Grub Street pointed out that the Soulé apprenticeship model is still how New York's restaurant world functions. In 1966, Claiborne wrote that Soulé was "The Michelangelo, the Mozart and the Leonardo of the French Restaurant in America." We've lost Rene Pujol and Le Biarritz, but go over to Tout va Bien during the upcoming US Open—where you might run into Roger Federer or Rafael Nadal (no joke, make resys). Or stop by Chez Napoléon for boar stew, a wedge of paté or cherries jubilee. They're still throughly French, completely eccentric and alive, for now.

Recipe Improv with Michael Psilakis

POST:
 Today we’re playing Recipe Improv with Michael Psilakis, exec chef and co-owner of Anthos, Kefi and Mia Dona. This has been a good year for Psilakis—Food and Wine magazine named him Best New Chef, and Anthos was nominated for a James Beard Award. But we’re sure that playing Recipe Improv was most thrilling of all. The mystery ingredients: Avocado, prosciutto, chicken liver We threw the mystery ingredients at Chef Psilakis, and he came up with a cold avocado soup, garnished with fried chicken liver, prosciutto and melon. It sounds absolutely, completely delicious. I may try it sometime soon and post the results here. Chilled Avocado and Yogurt Soup with Crispy Chicken Liver, Prosciutto and Cantaloupe Yield: 6 servings 3 cups whole milk 3 avocados 1 1/2 cups strained Greek yogurt 2 tablespoons lemon juice salt and pepper extra-virgin olive oil for frying and garnish 6 slices prosciutto 12 cilantro leaves rice flour, for dusting chicken liver 8 ounces chicken liver, cubed 24 cantaloupe balls, scooped using a melon baler In a blender, combine milk, avocado and yogurt. Purée, and then strain the mixture through a chinoise or any fine strainer. Stir in the lemon juice, and season to taste with salt and pepper. Set aside in the refrigerator to chill. In a deep pan over medium-high heat, pour in the oil to a depth of about 4 inches, and allow it to get hot. Fry the prosciutto until crisp; remove from pan and place on paper towels. In the same oil, fry the cilantro leaves until crisp, and remove onto paper towels. Keep the oil hot. Spoon rice flour into a shallow bowl. Season the chicken livers with salt, and then roll cubes of chicken liver in rice flour, and shake off excess. Fry the chicken livers in the hot oil until crispy and brown. Reserve livers on a paper towel and allow to cool to room temperature. In a small bowl, dress melon balls with 2 tablespoons olive oil, and salt and pepper to taste. To serve, pour soup evenly into six shallow, large bowls. Scatter an equal serving of fried chicken liver, melon balls and fried prosciutto in the center of each bowl, and garnish with fried cilantro leaves and an additional drizzle of olive oil.

 I was at a friend's apartment last night, and just before we were about to walk over the Wilco concert, she started offering pills around. Not those kind of pills—these were little green gel caps called Eat Whatever, full of peppermint and parsley oils. You know those horrible, embarrassing burps you get after you have a garlicky or oniony meal? Swallow these pills after a meal, and they render your burps minty fresh all night. I was skeptical, but I tried them, and they worked. And they make burping sort of...weirdly enjoyable. Maybe I was high after all. Buy them online here.

4 Questions: Anne Burrell Wants to Read Your Mind

POST:
Dreaming of backflips Anne Burrell's been busy lately. She has a new Food Network show, Secrets of a Restaurant Chef, cooks at Centro Vinoteca every night, and has just been named a Rising Star Chef by Star Chefs magazine. We caught up with Burrell to ask her our signature, Bawbawa Walters-style, Four Questions not About Food. What was the last book you read? Did you like it? Julie and Julia by Julie Powell. Yes! As a kid, I used to watch Julia on TV. Julie’s stories of cooking in a small apartment kitchen cracked me up. What animal would you like to be reincarnated as, and why? A cat. All I’d have to do is eat, sleep and play. Choose a superpower. Read people’s minds or be in two places at the same time. What did you dream about last night? That I was on the US women’s gymnastics Olympic team.

Al Jazeera's NYC Street Food Special

POST:
 On Serious Eats today, there's a posting of an Al Jazeera special on Jerusalem's street food. It delves into what food means in a war-torn city in a serious way without neglecting to celebrate the simple, pleasurable nature of street food. It's really well done, and it made me wonder if Al Jazeera often covers food. A quick search on You Tube yielded a bunch of these 12-minute "Street Food" segments, exploring cities all over the world, from Nairobi to Cairo to London. This segment, posted above is all about New York's street food and the lives of the vendors, many of whom are from the Middle East or South Asia. It's really engaging and well worth the 12 minutes it takes to watch it—a familiar subject seen through a different lens. Plus, Our Man Sietsema makes a surprise appearance about halfway through!

Fork in the Road In Search of Great Cocktail Eats

POST:
 I would love to find a cocktail lounge where the food is every bit as delicious and lovingly tended to as the booze. So I was excited to hear that Philip Kirschen-Clark, formerly of Jimmy's #43, was now on board at Pegu Club and revamping the menu. So this week, I'm eating (and drinking) at Pegu Club and Clover Club. I sampled almost everything on both places' menus, and there were a few completely wonderful, delicious dishes—notably the fried squid at Pegu Club and the shrimp toast at Clover Club. But the food programs at both are noticeably lackluster—and yes, I understand that they're meant to be cocktail lounges—but it seems that there's an untapped opportunity to open a fancy cocktail lounge where the food is just as good as the drinks.

 This week, Our Man Sietsema is at James, a new American bistro in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn. And it's an almost unqualified rave. Our Man loves the sweetbreads, the asparagus salad, the burger, the heirloom tomato salad... Even the wine garners Our Man's praise—a well-priced selection that includes a French Muscadet and an Italian Barbera, both of which Our Man enjoys. The only things that bother Our Man about James is the lack of vegetarian entrees, and the need for an awning to block the strong late afternoon sun. Our Man doesn't write reviews like this everyday, so I suggest you get there soon. James 605 Carlton Avenue Prospect Heights, Brooklyn 718-942-4255 Were my friends and I dining at some gold-plated Vongerichten, Boulud, or Bouley outpost? How did neighborhood bistro fare become so—for lack of a better word—sophisticated? And who swiped the French-onion soup and steak frites?

Mei Lai Wah Pork Buns: What Am I Missing?
AUTHOR:
Sarah DiGregorio
DATE:

POST:
Delicious rice noodle roll I stopped by the newly reincarnated Mei Lai Wah (64 Bayard Street) today, which is now cleaner and brighter, but, by all accounts, just as good as before. A confession: I hadn't been there before it closed. When I was doing research for my Chinatown bakery story, I talked to Chinese cookbook author Grace Young, who said that Mei Lai Wah had been one of her favorite places for a steamed roast pork bun. But by then it was too late to try what was apparently the ultimate char sui bau. But now, as you've probably heard, Mei Lai Wah rides again. So I went by for lunch today and got a rice noodle roll with shrimp and a steamed roast pork bun. And they were both very good, absolutely above average, but I liked the rice noodle roll more than the bun. The noodles were very delicate and slightly chewy, filled with small, nicely cooked shrimp. The char sui in the bun, while tender and well-fatted, didn't have any sauce at all. Maybe this makes me a char sui bau philistine, but I like the slightly sweet slick of oyster-hoisin sauce that's usually mixed in with the pork. I don't like it too sweet, or gloppy or full of food coloring. But I don't think a dry pork bun is as good as one with sauce. So were the Mei Lei Wah buns always like this, and do people love this style, or did I just get an off batch? Here's a picture, below, of the bun. Sorry it's out of focus, I always feel like such an ass sitting in a restaurant and taking pictures of my food, so I try to do it as quickly as possible. Do tell: is this your beloved bun?

 So here's an amazing contraption. From the Jesus pan website: So I guess you could sear a Jesus into your quesadilla or French toast and then try to sell it to the pathologically gullible on Ebay. Alternatively, the website suggests just bringing the Jesus pan to a church pancake breakfast and preparing "holy hotcakes" for the flock. Either way. For serious. [Via Word of Mouth] Holy images have been popping up all over... A grilled cheese sandwich with the image of the Virgin Mary sold for over 17-hundred dollars on Ebay.

 We played 'What is it?' on Friday with the dish pictured above. Brownvid got it first: And then dadand10 chimed in asking if it is "khandvi maybe?" You're both right, it's the Gujarati dish khandvi (that's how I'd spell it anyway, I'm sure there are spelling variations in English). It's made by heating a batter of chickpea flour and yogurt until thick, and then spreading the batter thinly onto a surface, cutting it into long strips and then rolling it up. The texture is very delicate and similar to fresh pasta. Usually khandvi is topped with spices that have been sizzled in oil. The version that I ate at Rajbhog Sweets and Snacks on Friday was garnished with sesame seeds, mustard seeds, halved green chiles and cilantro. Yum. If you want to make it at home there's a great step-by-step photo essay about making khandvi here. Or, try it at Rajbhog Sweets and Spices. 7227 37th Ave Jackson Heights, NY 11372 (718) 458-8512 it's called "khandavni" and it tastes delish!

The Hottest Salsa in the World

POST:
Bhut jolokias, soaking innocently In this month's issue of Gourmet, Karen Coates goes all the way to Nagaland, in northeast India, to taste the bhut jolokia, which was discovered in 2006 to be the hottest chile in the world. But you don't have to go around the world to try bhut jolokia—good-quality dried ones are available at Kalustyan's. I bought an ounce ($8.99) a couple weeks ago, and they've been sitting in my cabinet ever since. I wasn't sure what to do with them. The packaging, for one thing, is a little intimidating. "Caution: World's hottest chile, handle with care," it reads. Handle with care includes eating them? For comparison's sake, the naga jolokia is about twice as hot as a Red Savina habanero (the hottest variety of habanero). But I used to work at Chile Pepper magazine—which, at one point, involved lying immobile on the floor of my cubicle clutching my stomach after taste-testing too many hot sauces—and I love spicy food. So, okay, I thought I'd make a simple, taqueria-style salsa from the naga jolokias. In Coates article she writes, "Natives of northeastern India don't eat bhut jolokia for its heat so much as for its smell. The pepper's unique sweet-smoky-spicy aroma has wooed disciples across India's northeastern states for centuries." As soon as I cut open the package, I knew exactly what she meant. The nagas smell similar to chipotles, smoky, but stronger, fuller and rounder. The aroma has a serious presence, and soon my whole kitchen was filled with it. The chiles themselves are brick red about an inch long, in the shape of thin lanterns. I cut off the stems, and then soaked the chiles in warm water for about 30 minutes. (Wear gloves, or at least be careful about washing your hands right after you touch them.) Then I put the re-hydrated chiles, some garlic, vinegar, water and salt in the blender and pureed it all together. When I popped open the lid, it was clear that the nagas had become less friendly. The smell was now more like something you would use against rioters. I was having a hard time being in the same room with the salsa. I scraped most of it into a bowl (not all of it because I was felled by a coughing fit, and I wasn't going to eat all of it anyway). With a container of yogurt handy, I dipped a cracker in and ate. And at first, it tasted really pretty good. Smoky, garlicky, hot. In fact, even though the heat blossomed and grew, it still wasn't unbearable. So I took a few more bites, getting cocky. Then I wished I hadn't. Because it is really, really hot. I sweated and dripped for about 10 minutes before it subsided. And now my mouth is numb. Obviously, using the chiles in salsa probably isn't their best use. In India, cooks use them as one small component of gravies or stews. But that was fun. And, um, you should try it! The Hottest Salsa in the World Yield: about 3/4 cup 1 ounce dried naga jolokia chiles, stemmed, soaked in warm water, drained 3 cloves garlic 1 tablespoon white vinegar 1/3 cup water generous pinch salt In a blender, combine all ingredients, and purée. Scrape out, and eat as a salsa (if you can) or add small amounts to soups or stews. This is very hot

The American Cookbook Project

POST:
 The Smithsonian Institution is running a traveling exhibition called Key Ingredients: America by Food. The exhibition is touring the country until 2013, gathering regional food history and customs as it goes. It doesn't seem to be coming to New York, (I guess our food culture is adequately cataloged, compared to say, Maryville, Tennessee) but it is in Woodbine, NJ, now through August 31. The most interesting part of the exhibition is the American Cookbook Project, which you can access online. It's like those self-published family cookbooks, writ large. Anyone can contribute a family recipe and the story behind it. On the website, you can sort by course, heritage-type, state or story-type. And it's all a little jumbled, in a good way. Under "Rites of Passage" you find oyster pie supreme, from a Maryland woman who hated oysters until her uncle made her eat them raw on the seashore, New Jersey breakfast, a pork roll, egg and cheese sandwich that the author claims is better than the best Philly cheesesteak, the Huffman-Fenton family's recipe for Iowa fried pheasant and squirrel, and Kentucky boiled custard, a rich, creamy drink dosed with bourbon. I'm drinking the kool aide on this one. There is something really beautiful about gathering all these different family recipes together. They're like capsules of information that allow you to share an experience with someone you've never met. For instance, I'll never meet Jackie Gilich, but I could make her father's recipe for Hrstule, Yugoslav bow-tie shaped pastries that her father made for the family on Christmas Eve. Or, for that matter, Iowa fried squirrel.

Brooklyn Bangladeshi
AUTHOR:

POST:
 After eating my way through part of the the Pakistani neighborhood on Coney Island Avenue in Midwood, Brooklyn, a couple weeks ago, I was curious to explore the nearby Bangladeshi part of Kensington. Walking down Church Avenue from Ocean Parkway, there's a hodgepodge of Polish/Israeli/Russian and Bangla markets. One pharmacy's sign is in English, Russian and Bengali. When you come to the corner of Church and McDonald Avenues, you've found the epicenter of the Bangladeshi businesses in the area. And conveniently, it's right at the Church Street F stop. A quick bit of background: In the 1947 partition of India, the region of Bengal was split into two: One became West Bengal, the Indian state that contains Calcutta, and the other became "East Pakistan"—part of Pakistan, but separated from it by one thousand miles of India. That was not a bright idea. (One in a long line of not-so-bright ideas implemented by the British during partition.) In 1971, East Pakistan was dissolved and became Bangladesh, an independent nation. Although Bengal is now split between two countries, Indian West Bengal and Bangladesh still share a common language, Bengali. There were always regional cooking differences within Bengal, and especially between Hindus and Muslims, but since the partition (which attempted to place Hindu Bengalis on the Indian side and Muslim Bengalis on the other) those differences have apparently become more pronounced. But generally, Bengali cooking, whether in India or Bangladesh, shows a fondness for mustard oil, mustard seeds and fish. Daal is usually eaten everyday. The Calcutta Kitchen is a fantastic cookbook and resource. In the book, Udit Sarkhel writes that although all Bengalis tend to love fish and shrimp (usually freshwater), one difference is that the Bangladeshi Muslim diet is also heavy on the meat, including beef. He elaborates: Okay, but what good Bangladeshi things can we eat in Kensington? There are two main restaurants, plenty of halal butcher shops and several small markets.  Jhinuk Restaurant (478 McDonald Avenue 718-871-5355) I had heard good things about this place, but because there's not really a menu (at least at lunchtime) you have to stick with what's been made that day for the steam table. Several of the items that I heard were good just hadn't been made today, so I tried a little bit of everything else. A bitter gourd stew turned out to be good, as was a fish curry and the lamb biryani. Best of all, though, was the spiced mashed potato dish (which I think is called alu-bhate). A potato mash seasoned with mustard seeds, chiles, onion and cilantro and finished off with plenty of mustard oil, it tasted pleasantly sharp and pungent. They also had pitha, a flat, fried bread, soaked in sweet syrup (pictured above). Definitely worth a try. Sugandha Restaurant (483 McDonald Avenue) This is a similarly bare-bones, steam table spot, right across the street from Jhinuk. And the same deal applied: most of the items I wanted to try hadn't been prepared today, so it was a game of steam table chance. Their lamb biryani is deluxe—featuring whole boiled eggs along with the nuggets of lamb and tiny, incendiary green chiles. The best pick, though, is the beef bhuna, a dry-ish, spice-laden mix of stewed beef, cubed beef liver, onions and whole green chiles. Completely delicious, and pictured below.  There are a several markets in the area; none are particularly fabulous, but Bangla Nagar Grocery (87 Church Avenue) is large and well-stocked. It's fun to wander through, picking up some spices or lentils or bitter gourd or mustard oil. (Ignore the slapped-on label that says 'For external use.' That's just a crazy US customs thing; it's for cooking.) Happy eating, and let me know if you have a favorite Kensington Bangladeshi place I've missed. Ginger, cumin and chile are the other spice mainstays; garlic is more a flavoring of the cooking of East Bengal (Now Bangladesh), than of West Bengal and Calcutta. If not strictly speaking a spice, sugar is used a lot in savory cooking in West Bengal, and this again clearly distinguishes between the food of West and East.

What's the Story Behind Chinatown's Bakeries?
AUTHOR:
Sarah DiGregorio
DATE:
2008-08-6 8:55:00
POST:
 For years, I've been curious about Chinatown's bakeries—the kind that sell elaborate European cakes, fusion-ish baked buns (like corn-mayo or hot dog-scallion), as well as more traditional Chinese sweets like moon cakes, lotus seed pastries and sesame balls. These bakeries, with their globetrotting cultural references, and emphasis on gorgeous pastry decoration, seem both strange and wonderful. So in my column this week I try to untangle exactly how this newer, fusion type of Chinese bakery came about, and where they come from. In the process, I talked to Chinese food expert and author Grace Young, who lamented that the quality of the baked goods at Chinatown bakeries is no longer very good. So I tasted my way through dozens of bakeries to find out which ones are doing certain items well. And to find that out, you'll have to click the clickity and read the story.

Our Man Sietsema Noshes on Cheb

POST:
 This week, Our Man Sietsema is in Harlem, thoroughly enjoying himself at a Senegalese cafe called Keur Mame Diarra. Here, Our Man is most excited about the cheebu jen, often referred to as simply "cheb," which is the Senegalese national dish. Mmmmm. For dinner, the menu switches from straight-up Senegalese lunch to a French colonialist tilt. You can tell Our Man is not quite as taken with these dinner offerings as he is with the lunch, but he does call out the guinea hen, saying it is "roasted so perfectly that it would make a French colonialist swoon." Oh my. Can you imagine a French colonialist swooning? Keur Mame Diarra 2401 Frederick Douglass Boulevard 212-866-0014 Keur Mame Diarra's splendid version begins with big chunks of dense-fleshed fish, stuffed with a thick purée of garlic, cilantro, and green onions. Along with an assortment of vegetables, the fish is scattered across the top of a rice mountain cooked in rich oily broth, with dried stockfish and tamarind thrown in for extra flavor. I've been told that cheb can be judged by the number of vegetables on top. At Mame Diarra, the lush collection includes carrots, cabbage, manioc, eggplant, okra, and calabaza squash.

Cheap Lunch! Tabla's New Street Cart

POST:
 Cheap Lunch! Tabla's new street cart (11 Madison Avenue; Mon-Fri 12pm-3pm) How cheap? $8 (Okay, not that cheap, but a lot more affordable than Tabla or Bread Bar.) Chef Floyd Cardoz recently opened a street cart outside Tabla/Bread Bar. It serves frankies—a kind of Mumbai burrito, made with an eggy roti rolled around a filling—and bhel puri, a variety of chaat, the spicy-sweet-sour crunchy Indian snacks. There's also kulfi, boiled peanuts and pomegranate lemonade. I was really excited about this. I happen to love Tabla, and I think New Yorkers should eat more chaat in general. In fact, we should have chaat stands all over town! I think it would catch on quickly. At least, I'd be there everyday. But anyway, I stopped by Tabla's cart for lunch. You can see the menu and the pricing above. Bhel puri is basically puffed rice and boiled, diced potatoes mixed with several chutneys and topped with sev, the fried vermicelli-like crunchy bits you can see in the picture below. The bland ingredients (puffed rice, potatoes, sev) are meant to be zipped up with the sour, sweet and spicy chutneys, and sometimes onion, chiles and tomatoes. This version was just a little bit disappointingly bland, with green mango standing in for sharp coriander chutney, and not enough tamarind chutney to lend sweetness. Bhel puri is not meant to be subtle; this one needed oomph. Still, it was tasty, and I bet if you asked them to make it stronger, they would. The frankie was great, with garlicky, mint chutney-smeared chicken tikka inside. The pomegranate lemonade was refreshingly tart and not too sweet. So, if you get tired of waiting in line at Shake Shack, you can scamper over to Tabla for some Indian street food. Bhel puri Chicken tikka frankie

The French are skipping lunch, and the four horsemen can't be far behind. Seriously, though, the spate of dreary news about food prices, shortages and contaminations is starting to get awfully depressing. And now the UK Times is reporting that their neighbors across the Channel are not eating and drinking the way they used to. Francis Attrazic, the vice-chairman of the French Union of Café, Restaurant and Hotel Owners is quoted: “Lunch is disappearing almost completely a lot of the time, people don’t always have an apéritif any more and the evening meal is being lightened.” Apparently, French lunches are turning into quick sandwiches and salads—luckily, there's no mention of munching them desk-side, American-style.

Acme Smoked Fish's Cheap Fridays

POST:
Acme's headquarters You know all that wonderful smoked salmon, sable, tuna, whole chub and whitefish that you shell out big bucks for at Zabar's and Russ and Daughters? If you go to the source, Acme Smoked Fish, you can get it all at wholesale price (well below retail) every Friday between the hours of 8am and 1pm. I know that's not a good time slot for those of us with, well, jobs, but I figure that summer Fridays are the times people are most likely to be able to take off early or get in late. And if you don't gobble it all on Friday afternoon, you'll have plenty of smoked fish for Saturday brunch. Acme has been in business since the early 1900's, and the company is still family-owned and run. They supply to iconic places like Russ and Daughters and Zabar's, and also make various salads, like kippered salmon and whitefish. This morning, I stopped by their headquarters. It's in an industrial part of Greenpoint, Brooklyn, and can be a little hard to find. Once you come to the front, pictured above, just walk in and go through the door to your right. There's all sorts of delicious fish laid out, all of it at excellent prices. You can sample, to see which you like best. I got 1/4 pound each of nova cold-smoked salmon (I got so excited that I forgot to ask where the salmon comes from, but I'm guessing it's Atlantic farmed), smoked sable, and pastrami-style smoked salmon. For the 3/4-pound total, the bill was $18. It's cash only. Acme Smoked Fish Corp. 30 Gem St. Brooklyn, NY 11222 718-383-8585 Nova salmon More nova salmon The set-up My loot

Is that really a great price, $18 for 3/4 lbs. of smoked fish? You can get a pound of lox at Zabar's for $18. I realize the sable is more expensive but it's hard to judge if this is a great bargain without the actual prices per pound.

Hey guys, Yes, it's true that you can get smoked salmon at certain places for cheaper than this. But I think the point is that it's the really good stuff from Acme—cold smoked, made the way it has been for years, available at the wholesale price. At Russ and Daughters, for instance, you'd get the same fish. There, the nova salmon runs between $25-48 per pound, the sable $32 per pound and the pastrami-smoked salmon is also $32. So although it can be a pain to get out there, if you are a fan of Acme's fish, I think it's worth it. --Sarah

 Campbell's Soup was the lone stock in the S&P 500 that managed to actually increase in value yesterday. Cheap canned goods just seemed like the only good bet. So in the spirit of bunker-building, here's a recipe for making canned tomato soup more delicious. This is the way my (future) Indian mother-in-law doctors up Campbell's. Don't worry, we can still be eating well in the apocalypse! (As long as the gas is still turned on!). Spiced Tomato Soup Yield: 2 servings Eat this over rice or by itself in a bowl 2 tablespoons vegetable oil 1 teaspoon mustard seed 1 teaspoon cumin seed 3 dried red chiles, broken in half 4 cloves garlic, chopped 1 teaspoon turmeric 1 (10 3/4 ounce) can tomato soup 10 3/4 ounces milk In a saucepan over medium-high heat, warm the oil until hot. Add the mustard seeds, cumin seeds and chiles, and cook until mustard seeds start to pop, and mixture is fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add the garlic and turmeric, and stir well. Reduce heat to low, and cook until garlic is softened, about 5 minutes. Add the can of soup, and then fill the can with milk and add the milk to the pan. Stir well, and bring to a simmer. Serve. Heating the mustard seeds, cumin seeds and chiles in oil Saute the garlic and turmeric All done. Hunker down and slurp.

Last night I stopped by a couple of Wall Street bars to see how the other half drowns their sorrows. There were more people out than usual, despite it being a Monday and the start of Rosh Hashanah. I went by Delmonico's, where two guys, one in a button-down, one dressed more casually, were drinking beer. I asked them if they planned to eat and drink differently now. (They didn't want to give their names.) Me: So what are you drinking? Trader #1: Bud Me: Is that what you always drink? T#1: Yes. I'm not ready to do the Wall Street swam dive quite yet. He [motions to friend] got out three months ago. T#2: [Grins] Last night I went to Momofuku Ko. Next month I'm going to French Laundry and on Wednesday, I'm going to Blue Hill. Me: So I guess getting out of the business three months ago was a good thing to do. What do you do now? T#2: I'm enjoying myself. Me: Oh. So. Is this situation as bad as it seems? T#1: This is a shitshow. This is Great Depression stuff. Ahhh, good! Moving on. I went over to Harry's, where the cheapest steak is $45, and where the bar was packed. There, I found another couple of guys in suits, these ones were drinking scotch. Me: So what are you hearing? Do people want to go out drinking? Are they thinking about cutting back on food or drink? Trader #3: Well, we trade in volatilities, so things are actually not so bad for us. Although I probably shouldn't say that too loud in here. Me: So do people want to go out and celebrate? T#3: Well, no, it's hard to be glad because this is bad for America. T#4: All I want to do is go have a drink! And a nice dinner too, but first go out for a couple beers. I don't want to sit at home. Me: Yeah, and watch CNN.

Black Bean Monday: Cheap Eats?

POST:
 It's hard to write about the next place to get yer $15 cocktails when it seems like we'll soon be living in boxes and eating packs of ramen for three meals a day. But there are ways to eat and drink cheaply in New York, at home or out. You just might want to avoid all the places where the bartenders are called mixologists. For home cooking, I nominate dried beans for best cheap date. You can make a good black bean soup for less than a dollar per serving—all you really need, when you get down to it, is beans, water, garlic, onion, spices and salt. And if you're feeling flush you can add a few strips of bacon. For cheap eating out, I love Yissel's 71 Chimichurri truck, which parks on Fourth Avenue at 36th Street in Brooklyn, from 8pm until dawn, Wednesday-Monday. A chimichurri, the massive, mayo-ed, hot sauced, torpedo-rolled Dominican hamburger, will probably fill you up for a few days for less than $5. Cheap Ass Food is a good site that covers, yes, cheap ass food. So, what are your plans for avoiding the breadlines? What are the most delicious ways you know of to eat ultra-cheaply?

 I've always wondered about the stories behind those wildly improbable dual-cuisine restaurants (like Mexican-Chinese places). Today, I stopped by the most globe-trotting spot I've seen yet—Salt and Pepper, a Indian-Pakistani-Spanish-American restaurant. The front counter serves New York "Spanish" food (read: pseudo Puerto Rican-Dominican) and some American stuff, like burgers and meatloaf. The back counter serves Indo-Pakistani food. I tasted a bunch of items here, and your best bet is definitely the shami (chicken) kabobs. They are clearly homemade—oblong fingers of ground chicken, heavily spiced, garlicky and speckled with cilantro. Everything else I tried was unremarkable, although the cauliflower was tasty. Although I thought the Indian-Pakistani food was better, the Spanish-American counter gets much busier. There's a steady stream of customers ordering things like roast chicken, beans and rice ($7). One of the employees told me that Salt and Pepper's owner is Pakistani, and one day he was sitting on the train, trying to think of ways to get more business. He decided that adding Spanish and American food would bring in more customers, so he added the extra steam table and doubled the menu. Everything is halal, though, so he had to forgo the porky dishes that you'd find at any other Spanish lunch counter. Salt and Pepper serves up that Spanish-American-Indian-Pakistani food 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Yay, America.

 Fulton [205 East 75th Street], a new restaurant from Joe Gurrera of Citarella, is slated to open this Wednesday. It's named after the old downtown fish market and will feature a seafood-heavy menu by Chef Jeremy Culver, formerly of Park Avenue Cafe and Gramercy Tavern. [FitR inbox] The winner of Bocuse d'Or USA was announced yesterday. Chef Timothy Hollingsworth of The French Laundry impressed judges (including Laurent Tourondel and Jean-Georges Vongerichten) with Atlantic Cod with Hawaiian Blue Prawns and Sea Scallops and Brandt Beef Tenderloin Roasted in Bacon with Beef Cheeks and Oxtail. Hollingsworth will travel to Lyon, France, to compete in the Bocuse d'Or international championship in January.

Roast pork lunch special: $5. Eat up, big spender! Cheap Lunch! In which we find good eats in cheap places. J&R Restaurant 468 Fourth Avenue, Brooklyn 718-788-8437 How cheap? $5 If there was ever a day for a cheap lunch, this is it, agreed? J&R Restaurant is a very old-school Puerto Rican spot, with a Pepto Bismol-pink counter, pink plastic stools and fake pink roses on the tables. The stern older woman behind the counter has a very serious beehive hairdo, and is also very serious about the telenovelas that play on the television in the corner. By the window, there are craggy piles of cuchifrito, the various Puerto Rican soul food-ish snacks—gigantic balls of fried plantain, pasteles and dark links of blood sausage. The lunch special, an enormous plate of yellow rice with pigeon peas, beans and meat sets you back five dollars. You have your choice of roast chicken, beef stew or roast pork. I got the roast pork. The rice are beans here are very good, and the pork is faintly gamey in a good way. The woman behind the counter got out a whole roast pork leg, and hacked up some meat and crisp skin for my plate. It can use a sprinkle of salt, but on the whole, a quality pile of meat. And, because I never know when to stop, I also ordered a salt cod fritter. They cost $1.50 and are the size of a small pancake. Hot and crunchy on the outside, gooey with salt cod and herbs on the inside, this is a very, very good fritter. Salt cod fritter

The Boom-Bust Restaurant Economy
AUTHOR:

POST:
 I recently ate at a new, popular restaurant. This place has gotten a lot of food media attention, and the place was absolutely packed. Very buzzy. The space is gorgeous, but it's clear that no one has put very much care into the food—not disgusting, just meh. Not worth it. But, like I said, the place was packed, and it probably will be packed for a couple months and then fade away when the next exciting thing opens. I can't imagine that it will have a life of more than five years, and I can't imagine that the owners don't know that. As Robert Sietsema often says, it's too bad that restaurateurs feel they have to open places that "foodies" will run to immediately and probably never go back to. It means that it's harder to find serious new restaurants that will be perennial favorites—places where the food, rather than the experience or the scene, is worth your money. So here's what I'm wondering: Why open a restaurant that's tied to the boom and bust cycle of 'the next big thing' in New York restaurant culture? If a 100-seat restaurant is full of people eating and drinking, are the owners really making so much money that it's worth it? Take Eater's deathwatch list. It's full of places like this: Sheriden Square (which closed today), Kurve, Merkato 55... The cycle: Hire a good PR firm and/or well-known chef or design firm, get a lot of buzz for your opening, maybe don't pay so much attention to the food, and then fade away into the night. Aside from the fact that it's not so good for the restaurant culture, does that sequence of events really make anyone much money?

 Yes, yes, our economy is in the tank and the American taxpayer is about to bail out those blue-shirted, blackberry-wielding bankers, but people, listen, the wheels of our fair democracy are turning, and take-out is required. The NYT reports that in the all-night session to hammer out a deal, someone had to get out that stack of menus and call out for food. ...And now I know I'd rather be in the Senate. After the overnight drafting efforts on both sides of Capitol Hill — with pizza on the House side, and Thai food in the Senate — Democratic officials said they had nearly completed a unified draft of a bill.

Breast Milk Ben and Jerry's?

 OMG, stop the madness. First it was this Swedish chef who wanted to put breast milk in his curries and soups. Now PETA has sent a letter to Ben and Jerry's, urging them to replace cow's milk with mother's milk in their ice cream. From the letter: Yes, PETA is made up of crazy people, but I'm not sure why this strikes me as such a bad idea. It's not as though cows and goats are cleaner than humans, but the idea of human milk really skeeves me out. But not everyone thinks so! In fact, I have a very nice and normal co-worker who recently rhapsodized to me about how she feels that breast milk would be delicious in a sweet dessert. No, Ben and Jerry's isn't going to be making the switch to breast milk anytime soon. But imagine the naming possibilities: Double D Dutch Chocolate? Boobalicious Berry?Fudge Nipple? Would you eat breast milk ice cream? Would you sell your milk for ice cream? If Ben and Jerry's replaced the cow's milk in its ice cream with breast milk, your customers-and cows-would reap the benefits.

Vintage Irving's Salad for Salad-Haters

POST:
For this week's New York Bites, our VV dining newsletter, Hailey Eber talked to chef Jasin Bunin of Vintage Irving, the lastest wine and small plates spot near Union Square. Bunin gave Hailey the recipe for this salt-cod croquette salad—which is a salad only if you consider a plate with one piece of lettuce and several croquettes and a slice of ham a salad. Not that I'm complaining. I'd eat it. Parma Salad with Bacalao Croquettes and Cilantro-Caper Dressing Yield: 4 Servings   For the vinaigrette: 1 bunch cilantro 1 cup capers 1 teaspoon dijon mustard 4 anchovy filets 1 cup lemon juice 2 cups olive oil For the croquettes: 1/2 pound bacalao (salt cod) boiled and shredded 1 potato, boiled and diced 1 small onion, diced 2 teaspoons chopped garlic 2 cups heavy cream 1/2 cup flour vegetable oil, for pan-frying For the salad: 4 romaine lettuce leaves 4 slices parma ham Make the vinaigrette: In a blender, combine cilantro, capers, mustard, anchovies, and lemon juice. Blend briefly to combine. Leaving the motor running, add the oil in a very slow, steady stream until mixture is smooth and emulsified. Make the croquettes: In a pan over low heat, saute the salt cod, potato, onion and garlic for 10 minutes. Add the cream, and bring to a simmer. Cook until liquid is reduced by half. Add the flour, and stir well. Cook 1 minute more, or until mixture is thickened. Allow mixture to cool. Roll cod mixture into finger-shaped croquettes. Pour oil into a heavy frying pan to a depth of about a half inch. Warm oil over medium-high heat. Pan-fry croquettes until crispy on both sides. Wrap a piece of ham around each lettuce leaf. Arrange lettuce-wrapped ham on 4 plates. Divide croquettes evenly between plates, and drizzle all with the vinaigrette.

POST:
 Today is South Africa's Braai Day, a national holiday when all South Africans are honor-bound to grill up some beastie. So this week, I check out Braai, the new South African barbecue spot in Hell's Kitchen. The restaurant can be a bit amateurish in its tendancy to stack food high, and squirt sauces in elaborate, disfunctional squiggles all over the plate. But clearly someone cares very much about the meat, which is grilled nicely over "braai wood," which comes from an African olive tree. Game like ostrich and venison get the braai treatment, but alas, there isn't any zebra. You'll have to click the clickity to find out about that.

Our Man Sietsema and the Undercover Cops

POST:
 This week, Our Man Sietsema checks out McWhorter Barbecue in Newark, which turns out to be an undercover cop hangout, much to Our Man's surprise. The barbecue is of the Portuguese churrascaria genre, which sizzles meat and poultry over very hot charcoal. "Chicken barbecue is rarely astonishing. Either the skin is too rubbery, or the flesh too dry," opines Our Man. I could not agree more. I can never understand why you'd order chicken at a barbecue joint. But this does sound like an exception: Well, okay, that sounds pretty good. Better yet: And the sausage sandwich was bliss: a thick hunk of Portuguese chourico thrust among sautéed onions and peppers, clearly inspired by Italian street-festival heroes. Beer is served on the sly here, presumably because undercover cops aren't supposed to drink on the job. But McWhorter pulls a hat trick by periodically splashing the skin with an oily spice mixture, and keeping the cooking time to a minimum—hence the frenetic spinning of the hand crank to keep the birds from burning. The chicken turns out juicy and slightly spicy, with a crisp, well-salted skin.

Gourmet Mag Lists Best Oldies

POST:
Grand Central's Oyster Bar, open since 1913 Gourmet always covers restaurants in the October edition, but the magazine that hits newsstands today is very different from restaurant issues of years past. Instead of chasing the next big thing, basically the default mode of most restaurant coverage, this year, Gourmet is focusing on the best places that have been around since 1941, the year the magazine launched. Here's their list of the best restaurants in the country that have hit the 67-year-old mark: Giardina's, Greenwood, MS Manago Hotel, Captain Cook, HI Bright Star, Bessemer, AL Gaido's Seafood Restaurant, Galveston, TX The "21" Club, New York City Sammy's Ye Old Cider Mill, Mendham, NJ Galatoire's, New Orleans The Student Prince, Springfield, MA Joe T. Garcia's Mexican Restaurant, Fort Worth El Charro Cafe, Tucson Locke-Ober, Boston Joe's Stone Crab, Miami Beach Hyeholde Restaurant, Coraopolis, PA Gene & Georgetti, Chicago Musso & Frank Grill, Hollywood The Lexington, St. Paul Lawry's The Prime Rib, Beverly Hills Maneki, Seattle The Oyster Bar, New York City Tadich Grill, San Francisco. So New York hits the list twice, with The Oyster Bar and The 21 Club. In another roundup, the editors list the 14 best old-school bars, and Bemelmans Bar is the New York pick. I would have added the Ear Inn, and, if I can bend the rules, Tout va Bien, which opened in 1949. Anyone else have an old-school favorite that the editors missed?

The Very Early Word: Porchetta 
AUTHOR:
Sarah DiGregorio

POST:
Porchetta sandwich—notice the slab of crunchy skin on the left Porchetta, the single-mindedly piggy new Italian sandwich shop, opened today. The roast pork emporium is Sara Jenkins' new venture; most recently, Jenkins was the chef at 50 Carmine, and she is the daughter of food journalist Nancy Harmon Jenkins. The shop is dedicated to, yes, porchetta, the Italian boneless pork roast that's meant to be lushly fatty and seasoned with garlic, herbs and plenty of salt. Porchetta is often stuffed into sandwiches in an Italian spin on fast food: slow-cooked meat, 30-second sandwich (meat, cracklings, bread). It was the first day Porchetta was open, so I'm not setting out to write a review of the place. This is simply a heads-up that this is a very, very fine sandwich, and there may be a line around the corner once the word gets out, so you may want to stop by soon. The menu is short. You can get the porchetta on a ciabatta roll or on a plate. There are beans, stewed bitter greens, roast potatoes (with pork bits) and homemade biscotti. Not much more. The set-up is similarly minimal. The place is tiny and sweet: blue and white tile, a few stools, a counter where you can gaze upon the large hunks of burnished-skinned pig. Everything in the shop is cooked in one small Electrolux oven, which sits out in plain view. Electrolux might be most famous for the old vacuum cleaner slogan ("Nothing sucks like an Electrolux"), but this little workhorse of an oven produces juicy, supple pork sheathed in impossibly crisp skin. The sandwich ($9) gets you a pile of the coarsely pulled meat, along with crunchy tabs of skin, on a ciabatta roll. Mine featured a mix of lean and fat that was nearly perfect. Stewed bitter greens include broccoli rabe and red chard, strewn with soft whole cloves of garlic. The roast potatoes are tossed in pork fat and little, crunchy bits of pork.

KF Seetoh on Singaporean Street Food
AUTHOR:
Sarah DiGregorio
DATE:
2008-09-19 10:10:00
POST:
The excitable KF Seetoh with a plate of char kway teow at last night's Taste of Singapore Eleven years ago, KF Seetoh realized that Michelin was "bullshit, man," and started work on his own guidebook, the Makansutra. He's half joking on the Michelin front, but he thought that Singaporean food, with its delicious blend of Chinese, Indian and Malay influences, deserved a serious guidebook of its own. He wrangled a team of "food police" to help him evaluate Singapore's many hawkers stalls and restaurants, and the resulting tome has become very popular— like Zagat mixed with the prestige and repute of the Michelin guide. Seetoh never accepts advertising from eateries, a policy that, he says, "gives me a good reputation and keeps me poor." The book awards chopsticks instead of stars, and is organized by dish. So if you're looking for the ultimate roti parata, you turn to that dish's page and find the restaurants that made the grade this year. The very top honor is three pairs of chopsticks, which is categorized not as "excellent," but as "die, die must try." Singaporeans take food seriously. Seetoh puts out a new version of the Makansutra every year and a half, and now has editions in Malaysia and Indonesia. He has played Singaporean food tour guide to Calvin Trillin and Anthony Bourdain. Today, Seetoh is in New York. The Singapore Tourism Board has flown him and several hawker cooks in to give classes at Whole Foods today. We talked to Seetoh last night about the hawker food culture in Singapore. Much of your book concerns street food, or hawker food. What's the hawker food culture like in Singapore? Everyone, even millionaires eat at the hawker centers. Everyone loves it and eats it everyday. Indian, Chinese and Malay food has intermingled, so that now you have Indians frying noodles. Usually each hawker specializes in one dish that they've been making for years. Your ultimate rating is "die die must try." What would you eat if it were your last night on earth? What's literally your "die, die" dish? Peasant food. I'm Cantonese and my father taught me to eat many strange and wonderful things. For my last meal it would have to be rice porridge with a salted duck egg. Simple. Since you divide your book by dish, are there any dishes that you're always looking for and never quite find the perfect version? There is never a perfect dish. But I enter into another dimension with it, telling one version of a dish from another. It's never about the best, it's about delving into the soul of that particular version. What do you want to eat while you're in New York? What I respect New York for is the diversity of the restaurants. Calvin Trillin mentioned that you can find three Uighur restaurants here! But you can't get good Singaporean food here. The chefs in Singapore are making too much money to want to come! 'Why go overseas? The sun shines everyday here, my son is at Harvard and I'm making money!' I always go to Peter Lugers when I'm here. It's like a pilgrimage to the mecca of steaks. I'm trying Per Se for the first time. And JG Melon and Shake Shack to see which burger is best.

Crazy Legs Conti: Competitive Movie Watcher?

POST:
 The International Federation of Competitive Eating sent me a press release on an upcoming competition yesterday, but it doesn't involve food. Apparently, starting on October 2, eight competitors, including Crazy Legs Conti, will compete in the Netflix Popcorn Bowl--a movie-watching championship. The competitors will sit in a plexi-glass "living room" in the middle of Times Square and will watch movies continuously for something like 5 days. (The world record, 120 hours, is held by Ashish Sharma, who will be defending his title.) The rules of the game: You can't take your eyes off the screen for more than a few seconds, and between each movie there's a 10 minute break. No sleeping. Dale and Thomas will be providing all-you-can-eat popcorn. Someone better tell them Crazy Legs is coming.

Make Il Buco's Crudo at Home

POST:
 For this week's dining newsletter, Hailey Eber talked to Il Buco's chef Ignacio Mattos about his annual pig roast, coming up this Monday. Stop by between 1pm and 6pm to see the great beastie being roasted and to taste it. The pig party moves inside at 6pm. Or, try Mattos' crudo recipe. It's actually very simple, and although it calls for special olive oils and chile powders, you can use what you have—it'll still taste great. Crudo di Pescespada con Arancia (Raw swordfish with orange, olives, celery and agrumato) Yield: 4 appetizer servings 1/2 pound swordfish 2 peeled oranges espelette chile powder, or any mild chile powder sea salt 1 celery heart, diced (just the small steams with yellow leaves) 3 ounces arbequina olives, or any small brown Mediterranean olive juice and zest of 2 lemons arugula, for garnishing bergamot agrumato olive oil, or any extra virgin olive oil Slice the swordfish very thinly, into about 1/8-inch slices. Set aside. Thinly slice the oranges. Arrange the swordfish and the oranges on a plate, and sprinkle the chile powder and salt over them. Scatter the celery, olives, lemon juice and zest, and arugula over the plate. Finish with a drizzle of olive oil and serve.

 This week, Our Man Sietsema visits Delhi Heights, a new Punjabi place in Jackson Heights with gussied-up decor (a Spam-colored bar). The spot features good versions of the usual Punjabi dishes, as well as vegetarian South Indian favorites like dosas (not as good) and Indo-Chinese fare like Manchurian cauliflower (awesome). In fact, if you're obsessed with Indian-Chinese (like I am), this is the place to go: Our Man says he finally has a reason to go to Jackson Heights. I'd add Rajbhog Sweets & Snacks to that list, which makes delicious chaat and Gujarati snacks. Delhi Heights turns out to be the best advocate for Indian-Chinese in town, utilizing the usual five sauces and adding some authentic Chinese stir-fries. The menu offers a transcendent cauliflower Manchurian—a "dry" curry annealed with a powerful sweet coating.

 This week, my column is about a day spent with Joanne Hendricks, at her cookbook shop on the far western edge of Soho. I love this shop, and think it's the most interesting place in the city to browse antique cookbooks and cookwares. It seems like a throwback to a time when Manhattan wasn't filled with the same shops as you find in a suburban mall, when a place of business could afford to be a little eccentric. You've got to trek over the Greenwich Street, but please go check it out. Even if you don't find anything to buy, it's really an amazing collection to poke through.

Bagel Smackdown! Winners, Losers, Fakers, Offal
AUTHOR:
Sarah DiGregorio
DATE:
2008-09-16 13:37:00
POST:
"Hey, this one looks like blood sausage! Or it could be my kidney," quoth Our Man Sietsema, demonstrating. In a convincing imitation of Mario Andretti, I drove my rattling, on-the-verge-of-death Toyota all over the city this morning, gathering up the bagels that you out there think are the best in the city. Luckily, your votes turned out to give us four well-regarded bagel spots that cut a nice swath through the boroughs: Bagel Hole in Park Slope, Brooklyn, Bagel Boy in Bay Ridge and Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn, Bagel Oasis in Fresh Meadows, Queens, Ess-a-Bagel on 1st Avenue and 21st Street in Manhattan. As soon as Robert (Our Man Sietsema) walked in, he asked me if I knew what constituted a real bagel versus a fake bagel. Real ones, I said, have to be boiled briefly before baked. Yes, he said, but some places use steaming machines instead of boiling them properly, and those fake bagels have a telltale bumpy grid on their bottoms. We flipped the bagels and they all checked out okay except Bagel Boy's, which was marred by the telltale imprint of the steaming machine. Fakers! Steamed bagels! Sagels? Fagels? Anyway. Robert didn't know where the bagels were from and tasted them blind. I had set up the tasting and written the shop names on the bottoms of the plates, and then promptly tried to forget which was which. Forgetting stuff comes naturally to me. We were looking for a slightly crisp-chewy crust (I like some blistering) and a moist-crumbed, dense interior that was neither dry nor undercooked, tasty, a little malty and yeasty but not too sweet. We didn't toast the bagels or sex them up with toppings. Plain Bagels Left to right: Ess-a-Bagel, Bagel Hole, Bagel Oasis, Bagel Boy Ess-a-Bagel: This one eked out first place, on the strength of its chewy crusty exterior and not-too-sweet, yeasty interior. Sure, it might be a little overweight, but it's damn good. RS: "It's like the first girl you ever kiss or your first pizza. It imprints as the best." Bagel Hole: The plain runner up, we liked that the longer you chew this dense little number, the better it tastes. The satisfying, starchy finish sneaks up on you. It looks like a little rock, with a very tough, chewy crust, and a very dense interior. You could probably knock someone out with it. RS: "I appreciate its compactness. You could put it in your pocket without making a mess." Bagel Oasis: This one looked the part, but didn't deliver on flavor. It had a nicely blistered crust (which Sietsema thought was a bit too tough, but I liked) but it tasted...eh. Like a bagel. RS: "It has a pellicle like some giant insect!" Bagel Boy: We were already biased against this bagel, knowing that it had been machine-steamed rather than boiled. And its texture was not right: puffy, spongy, slick. RS: "It's like a cheap, shiny new car that you know won't last more than 20,000 miles." Pumpernickel Bagels Left to right: Ess-a-Bagel, Bagel Hole, Bagel Oasis, Bagel Boy Bagel Hole: It takes a lot to get two professional eaters to just shut up and say "That's good," but that's what this delicious bagel did for us, and neither of us are natural pumpernickel fans. Fragrant, wallops of caraway, crusty, dense, a little sweet. Bagel Oasis: We liked the nicely blistered, chewy crust. Best for caraway haters, since it's milder than the others. RS: "Nice salt component." Ess-a-Bagel: Solidly in third, but meh. Simple. Bagel Boy: RS: "This looks like blood sausage. It could be my kidney!" [models] SD: "That's funny, everyone coming by my desk commented that this one looked the best." RS: "That's because they like meat." The end. Salt Bagels Left to right: Ess-a-Bagel, Bagel Hole, Bagel Oasis, Bagel Boy Bagel Oasis: Salted on the top and bottom, this one tasted kind of like a good pretzel. Chewy, yeasty, salty. RS: "The most Teutonic of bagels." Bagel Hole: Only salted on the top (which seems like it wouldn't work well if you wanted to eat it one half at a time), this one tasted pleasantly oniony for some reason. The last two salt bagels did not meet with our approval and sent Robert off. Bagel Boy: RS: "This bagel is trying to ingratiate itself with us." Ess-a-Bagel: RS: "Skanky, like someone dragged it up 1st Avenue." Info Bagel Oasis 183-12 Horace Harding Expressway, Fresh Meadows (Queens) 718-359-9245 Ess-a-Bagel 359 1st Avenue 212-260-2252 Bagel Hole 400 Seventh Avenue, Brooklyn 718-788-4014 Bagel Boy (two locations) 1602 Avenue Z, Brooklyn 718-332-3444 8002 Third Avenue, Brooklyn 718-748-0366

I really like Tal Bagels on East 86th. (Note that there are several other Tal Bagels, but the ownership is different.) Crisp and crunchy on the outside, and moist and chewy inside. Great Nova too, but it's not cheap. They won best bagels in the city in the 2007 NY Mag Food Issue. I have always loved Bagel Oasis. I am (un)lucky enough to do the reverse commute out to LI everyday. Exit 25 is a favorite pit stop of mine, although I wonder if Oasis has new ownership. I haven't seen any of the "usual" faces in there lately.

Please include Murray's in future competitions. They make my favorites bagels in NYC and I want to see how they stand up in a professional evaluation.

The contenders in plain, pumpernickel and salt Last week I asked you to write in with your favorite bagels. Today, Our Man Sietsema and I sampled bagels from the places you mentioned, seeking the ultimate bagel. We discovered one well-regarded place is actually selling fake bagels—fagels? We chewed away on the great and the mediocre, and Our Man let loose in his usual manner: "This one could be my kidney!" Check in later today to find out which bagels prevailed in our blind taste test.

 What's For Dinner? In which we stop random New Yorkers on the street and ask them about their food lives. Who: Shameel Arafin Age: 32 Occupation: Programmer Where: Taking a break outside his office on Cooper Square What's your best food memory? My friend's kitchen on the Lower East Side. She cooks a lot and has me over. Recently, she made an octopus salad...skate...she makes all kinds of weird things. What's the strangest thing she's ever made? Bear. Where did she get bear? I don't know, she's French. Did you like it? Not especially. It was too tough. What's the most delicious dish she's ever made for you? The skate. She baked it lightly, and it had a light white sauce, lemon and white wine. I've known her for 12 years, so that's a lot of dinners. I have a French friend and and Italian friend, and they both cook for me, so that's good. Any favorite restaurants in the city? I eat out a lot because I don't cook. I like Soy [102 Suffolk Street]. It's Japanese comfort food; they don't really have sushi, it's more meat and potatoes...like ginger pork with pickled cabbage. It's kind of a divey place. The owner is a lady who used to be a handbag designer, and she realized there was nowhere to eat in the neighborhood, this was several years ago, so she converted her store into a restaurant. I also like Yuca Bar , for a boisterous time. Burgers, ribs...mojitos are their specialty. What's your first food memory? Being forced to eat tomatoes by my mom. Do you like tomatoes now? They're okay. And spinach. I don't eat spinach to this day. What's for dinner tonight? I'm not sure, I don't have any plans. I'll walk out my door and figure it out. I live on Meserole Street in Bushwick. There's a place called Mojito Loco nearby. Bushwick is quite hip these days. It's not going to stay cheap for long.

The 12 Dirtiest, Cleanest NYC Restaurants
AUTHOR:
Sarah DiGregorio

POST:
 Yesterday, State Senator Jeff Klein released his annual list of the 12 dirtiest and cleanest New York restaurants. Klein compiles his lists from Department of Health restaurant inspection info, and he reserves special ire for pest-ridden restaurants. He released his two lists at a press conference outside Del Posto, in the meatpacking district, which failed its inspection in June but has since cleaned up the problems. Klein wants the city to adopt a grading system (like LA's), in which each restaurant is given a DOH grade, A-D, and must post the grade prominently. That might work better than just shutting down places at the drop of a hat—if your favorite restaurant earns a C, you can decide for yourself whether to go there or not. Here are the lists (which Klein calls the "Dirty Dozen" and the "Sparkling Twelve.") Heh. Frankly, I think I'd rather eat cockroaches than go to the McDonald's that's listed as one of the cleanest. On the other hand, Sripraphai, the fantastic Queens Thai spot, is also listed as one the cleanest—just another good reason to eat there. 26 Seats is the only relatively high-profile restaurant called out on the dirty list. The lists are below, with their violation scores in parentheses after the date of inspection. Senator Jeff Klein’s Dirty Dozen New York City Restaurants of 2008 EL BARRIO RESTAURANT 152 EAST 110 STREET, MANHATTAN 7/24/08 – INSECTS, COCKROACHES (204) GOLDEN KRUST CARIBBEAN BAKERY 1862 NOSTRAND AVENUE, BROOKLYN 7/09/09 – MICE, INSECTS, COCKROACHES (182) GUACAMOLE’X 1186 EAST 180 STREET, BRONX 7/25/08 – MICE, INSECTS (126) MERRY JERRY’S JAMAICAN RESTAURANT 102 SARATOGA AVENUE, BROOKLYN 7/10/08 – RATS, INSECTS (125) NEW CHOPSTICK HOUSE 102-09 QUEENS BOULEVARD, QUEENS 7/03/08 – MICE, COCKROACHES (100) NINO’S PIZZA 842 FRANKLIN AVENUE, BROOKLYN 7/29/08 – MICE, INSECTS, COCKROACHES (98) THE METROPOLITAN GRILL 1 MADISON STREET, MANHATTAN 6/05/08 – MICE, INSECTS, COCKROACHES (97) CAFÉ CARCIOFO 248 COURT STREET, BROOKLYN 7/29/08 – MICE, INSECTS (97) JIMMY’S COFFEE SHOP 900 6 AVENUE, MANHATTAN 7/08/08 – INSECTS, COCKROACHES (95) POPCORN HOF AND BAR 246 EAST 204 STREET, BRONX 4/24/08 – MICE, RATS (93) ACTION BURGER 513 GRAND STREET, BROOKLYN 4/17/08 – MICE, RATS (93) 26 SEATS 168 AVENUE B, MANHATTAN 8/06/08 – MICE, INSECTS (92) Senator Jeff Klein’s Sparkling Twelve Cleanest New York City Restaurants of 2008 ARTUSO PASTRY SHOP 672 EAST 187 STREET, BRONX 1/23/08 (7) BLIMPIE 85 EAST GUN HILL ROAD, BRONX 10467 4/2/08 (5) CAFFE ITALIA 12-40 A CLINTONVILLE STREET, QUEENS 10/16/07 (4) CARIFESTA RESTAURANT 4251 WHITE PLAINS ROAD, BRONX 4/2/08 (4) CHURRASCARIA PLATAFORMA 316 WEST 49 STREET, MANHATTAN 4/22/08 (6) CORATO PIZZA II 60-91 MYRTLE AVENUE, QUEENS 2/20/08 (2) MCDONALD'S 119-05 LIBERTY AVENUE, QUEENS 4/9/08 (7) OCEAN GRILL 384 COLUMBUS AVENUE, MANHATTAN 11/27/07 (5) PRIMO AMORE 34-33 FRANCIS LEWIS BOULEVARD, QUEENS 10/11/07 (2) RUSSO'S ON THE BAY 162-45 CROSS BAY BOULEVARD, QUEENS 11/1/07 (4) SRIPRAPHAI THAI RESTAURANT 64-13 39 AVENUE, QUEENS 11/29/07 (5) TRATTORIA ALBA 233 EAST 34 STREET, MANHATTAN 2/21/08 (5)

In response to the first comment, it's only bad if the "cleanest" restaurant you've been to is the McDonalds (HaHA! No, they do make tasty fries....). Great article. There are a lot of dirty spots out there, but it's excellent to point out the good places that put hygene and health on par with serving good food.

 The Villager reported this week that Lola Is Soul has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy—a sad end, I thought, for a spunky restaurant with good Southern-style food and fun live music. Recently, Lola had been embroiled in disputes with the community board over their cabaret and liquor licenses. (As though Soho is known for being a quiet little residential enclave.) After a heated legal battle, the restaurant finally got both licenses just about a month ago. I called Thomas Patrick-Odeen, who owns the restaurant with his wife, Lola. He said that Lola is absolutely not closing, but that he's been advised by his lawyer not to get into details about the bankruptcy case. "We've been around since 1985 and fighting for this space for four years," he said. "We're not going anywhere." Patrick-Odeen did mention that they have hired a new chef, William Stein, formerly of Water's Edge in Long Island City. Stein will be maintaining the Southern soul feel of the menu, and tweaking it to include fall ingredients. He said they've just gotten in some truffles from Georgia, so keep an eye out for fungus with a southern accent.

Poll: New York's Best Bagels

POST:
 Robert Sietsema and I just wrapped up writing our portion of the Best Of New York issue, which comes out in late October. Obviously, any Best Of list is a work of opinion designed to spark conversation more than to be utterly definitive. Everyone loves lists and superlatives, and arguing over them. With something as subjective as food, there will always be people who think your picks are akin to crimes against humanity. It's fun to make a stand for your favorite underdog place or to debate the relative merits of perennial favorites like Di Fara's and Shake Shack. So Robert and I have spend a lot of time talking about iconic New York foods in the past couple months. But I realized that there's one iconic food we didn't cover—bagels. So I'm wondering, what's your pick for the best bagels in New York? Let's vote! Email me or leave your pick in the comments.

Best Markets: M2M

POST:
Banchan at M2M Mart Best Markets: In which we explore some of the most interesting food shops in the city. M2M (Morning to Midnight) Market is a Japanese convenience store/fast-food udon/soba/sushi shop. The selection isn't nearly as quality as Sunrise Mart, just up the street, but M2M is a good stop for prepared and convenience foods. Along with a wide assortment of dried and frozen noodles, gyoza, rice crackers, sauces and other convenience foods, it also carries American 7-Eleven staples, like cookies, Lean Cuisine, energy bars, etc. Because M2M seems to want to be accessible to NYU students of all stripes, the Japanese (and some Korean) groceries are labeled very clearly, making it a good stop if you want to get in and out quickly and don't have time for a fun, leisurely poke around Sunrise Mart. The counter dosing out soba, udon and sushi is serviceable but not fantastic, and the produce section is meager, so it's pretty much all about the prepared foods and the snacks. Check out the refrigerators that line the walls. Good buys: Dried squid banchan: Find these in the refrigerated section near the big vats of kimchi. These chewy, slightly sweet strips of lacquered, dried squid taste mildly fishy and are one of my favorite Korean side dishes. $3.99 Stewed lotus root banchan: Also in the refrigerated section with all the other plastic packs of Korean side dishes, the stewed lotus root is crunchy and honeyed. For a quick, simple supper, steam some white rice and have this (and any other banchan you like) on the side. $2.99 Stewed tofu: Check out the big plastic containers full of sliced tofu napped with a flavorful paste of hot pepper, scallion, garlic and sesame seeds. This dish is eaten cold, so grabbing a package turns out to be incredibly convenient for a quick, light meal. I eat it right out of the pack. $3.49/approximately a pound Kasugai gummies: God, I love these. They come in pineapple, muscat grape, kiwi and other artificially fruity flavors. I don't know what they do to these to make them taste so much better than other gummy candies--the texture hits an addictive chewy/soft balance, and the flavors are great. If you are a gummy candy fan, you have to try them. 2.30/large package Umeboshi: These small magenta balls are Japanese pickled plums. Purée half of one with some white miso, sesame seed, ginger, oil and rice vinegar for a salad dressing. Or, drop one in a chilled glass of sake or sochu. Shinakiku brand, $4.99/8.46 ounces Salmon and tuna sashimi quality fillets: When you consider that one piece of salmon sushi costs at least two or three dollars, you're better off buying the pristine, sushi-quality fish here and making your own at home. $14.99/pound M2M Mart has two locations. The Broadway branch is uptown near Columbia; I've only been to the downtown branch, so can't vouch for the uptown one. 200 E 11th Street 212-353-2698 2935 Broadway 212-280-4600

Cheap Lunch! El Nuevo Sabor Latino

Pernil, $7 Cheap Lunch! In which we find good eats in cheap places. El Nuevo Sabor Latino 620 4th Avenue, Brooklyn 718-788-9063 How cheap? $7 whole roast chicken (so about $3.50 a serving) $7 gigantic plate of pernil, plus rice and beans (again, $3.50 a serving, easily) I walked by El Nuevo Sabor Latino about a hundred times before I really noticed it. It's on a drab stretch of 4th Avenue, right at the Prospect Avenue R subway stop. The tiny Dominican lunch counter with a burgundy awning doesn't look like anything much. The fanciest thing about it is the enormous flat-screen TV that plays Yankees games in high-def. Once, on a whim, I stopped in and ordered the roast chicken— $7 gets you the whole bird, hacked into wings, thigh, breast. I'm not a fan of any old rotisserie chicken, but this one is totally sublime, dripping garlicky juices and covered in salty, burnished skin. The pernil comes with slabs of pork skin that are as crisp as a potato chip, and big hunks of lucious, porky meat, deeply browned in spots. Squeeze on the lime and try to control yourself. The rice and beans are pretty mediocre, but I, for one, don't really care. This is a place that knows its way around meat and garlic. There's also a selection of Dominican breakfast items, which I haven't tried, like mashed green plantain with eggs, cheese and salami, or cassava with sausage. You're probably not in this neighborhood for lunch, (called Green-wood Heights, or South Park Slope, your pick), but pick up a chicken and it'll feed you for two days, or at least be dinner for two. (Unless you are a total pig, like me, in which case the pernil will be gone before your boyfriend even knows you bought it.) Roast chicken, $7 per bird

 This week, I'm at Peaches Market, the new restaurant in Stuyvesant Heights from Craig Samuel and Ben Grossman, who also own Smoke Joint and Little Piggy, both in Fort Greene. Peaches is busy on most nights, and it's possible that it got popular more quickly than Samuel and Grossman anticipated. Some of the food, especially the Cajun and Creole offerings, are not as good as they sound. At the same time, there are spectacular fried green tomatoes, cornmeal-fried fish, smoked beef short ribs and crisp-skinned, lemony roast chicken. Not only that, but the place is one of the most utterly pleasant places I've been to recently--it's lively and relaxed and charming in an uncalculated way. I don't know if I would make a special trip from another borough to eat there, but that isn't the point of Peaches anyway--it's not meant to be a destination restaurant. It's meant to be a Brooklyn neighborhood restaurant, from a couple of Brooklyn-born restaurateurs. And in that sense, Peaches is pretty great.

Our Man Sietsema Ponders Vermont Curry, Curry-Ya

 This week, Our Man Sietsema enthusiastically examines Curry-Ya, the Japanese curry spot. It wouldn't be an Our Man column without tidbits like these: And: Yeah! Why is it called Vermont Curry? Because of the apples? Our Man seems more fascinated with the food than completely pleased by it--he's having fun. Every element of the meal has something quirky about it. The rice is molded into the shape of a LifeSaver, the salads are weird multicultural blends of things like seaweed and baby lettuce, and the curry toppings are strangest of all, including raisins, dehydrated garlic, and cheddar cheese. Of the meat choices, Our Man likes the panko-breaded pork, but suggests the hamburger: "It might leave you scratching your head—but with your hunger magnificently satisfied." According to a survey by S&B Foods, a Japanese curry manufacturer, people in Japan currently eat curry at least five times a month. Japanese curries invariably involve a gluey brown gravy—thickened with flour and flavored with raw curry powder—that would make Indian chefs wince. One of the country's premier brands, Vermont Curry, boasts that it's sweetened with apple and honey. (Please ponder the significance of "Vermont Curry" and then let me know what it means.)

Cooking with Stephanie Izard

POST:
 Last night, the Culinary Institute of America at the Astor Center presented a cooking class with Stephanie Izard, the most recent winner of Top Chef. Izard demonstrated two dishes that she cooked on the show: Duck a la orange with braised duck spring rolls and bok choy, and roasted lamb with maitake mushrooms, blackberry gastrique and braised pistachios. I'm not sure the class functioned so well in terms of actually learning how to make the recipes Stephanie demoed, but by no fault of hers. Some of the necessary prep hadn't been laid out (no hot oil in which to fry), and most of the audience questions were about Top Chef rather than her technique. Stephanie seemed just as genuine, competent and down to earth as she did on the show--she might be the most naturally likable person ever to appear on reality television. Highlights: Those braised pistachios that Ted Allen went crazy for on the show were, in reality, totally delicious. And simple: pistachios, chicken stock and salt, simmered for 40 minutes, the end. After filming the first episode's elimination challenge, and getting freaked out because Anthony Bourdain had walked in, Stephanie had a "little panic attack" and the show's medics had to attend to her. On Lisa: "She's great. They had to make someone the villain." Lisa is listed in Stephanie's phone as "Leeza," for the way Daniel Boulud pronounced the name. To braise in a short amount of time (like if you're on Top Chef...or if your friends are coming over for dinner soon) cut the meat into smaller pieces, and braise on the stovetop (rather than in the oven), using slightly higher heat than you otherwise would. You can save braising liquid (including all the aromatics and seasonings) and use it over and over. Stephanie said that she's worked in kitchens in which the same braising liquid is used for "months and months." Just bring it to a boil every few days for food safety. On the Dale-Lisa mutual tantrum/Jen-kicking-chair scene: "We were in that room for up to six hours at a time, and there's this big cooler of wine and beer. Jen got upset because Zoe was leaving the show...Dale decides to start screaming at Lisa even though we won...I think that's what they [the producers] want. They were like 'sweet.'" Stephanie will be opening a "fun, funky gastro-pub" (obvs) in Chicago next spring. She and her partners are currently scouting locations. She's also working on a cookbook. On a night out with Mario Batali: "He likes to throw back a couple cocktails...I wouldn't recommend drinking three big glasses of Fernet." Having left her restaurant, Scylla, Stephanie worked as a personal chef for a family in the Hamptons this summer. (Unsurprisingly, she decided personal cheffing was not for her.) Restaurant recommendations in Chicago: Avec and L20. Lamb with blackberry gastrique, maitake mushrooms and braised pistachios

Eating with the Pols: Council Member Eric Gioia
AUTHOR:
Sarah DiGregorio
DATE:
2008-09-8 17:08:00
POST:
Welcome to a new feature, Eating with the Pols, in which we talk to local politicians about New York food issues. Meet City Council member Eric Goia, who has been serving since 2002. Not only does he represent one of the most delicious districts in the city--District 26 encompasses Woodside, Sunnyside, Long Island City and Astoria--but he also recently made news by reportedly supporting the Los Angeles fast food ban, sparking speculation that a similar measure might take root here. We asked him to clarify, and it turns out that Gioia has a lot of interesting things to say about the state of food and poverty in New York. What's the most pressing food issue in New York today? Food stamps have been a big issue for me since 2002, when I started looking into how the city allots them. The basic breakdown is that about 1.9 million people qualify, and just over a million receive them, so about half of the people who qualify for food stamps don't sign up for them. In studies, we found that it's working people, people who are not on other forms of public assistance, and there are two reasons they don't apply. One is: 'I didn't know I qualified,' and the other is: 'I know I qualify, but the red tape is so thick, that I can't take time off work to go get it.' The food stamp program is fully funded by federal government, so it's inexplicable that the city wouldn't make it more accessible, when there are literally billions of dollars to feed hungry children available, that's billion with a 'B.' I'm happy to say that, in part because of my advocacy, the food stamp application has been reduced from 24 pages to 4 pages, and the application offices are kept open later. I'd like to see the application fully online, so that people can do it at work, or go to into a library and fill it out. Last year, I lived on food stamps for one week to see how it was--I thought it would be difficult but it was even more difficult than I thought it would be. For one thing, no coffee, so two or three days later, I got a headache. And what was fascinating were other things you take for granted. If you're working a 12 or 14 hour day, and you're not going to be close to home, you've got to think about what to pack to bring from home to eat. So you end up lugging around a PB and J, and that's your dinner. And it's far more difficult for those who do this everyday. There's a misconception, spread by the radical right, that if only poor people knew how to eat better, they'd be healthy, and heart disease, obesity and diabetes wouldn't be the terrible problems that they are. But when I was on the food stamp diet, I could only afford the less healthy choices, like ramen and processed cheese. We shouldn't kid ourselves that it's only about education, we have to allow people to help themselves, and give them the options to eat healthy. That means signing up more people for food stamps, which will increase the federal funds coming to New York, and increase the purchasing power in less affluent neighborhoods. If you drop 10 million dollars of money to buy food into a neighborhood, a smart grocer is going to open a store there. And we need to encourage greenmarkets, food co-ops to expand accept foods stamps. The biggest offender is Costo--they don't accept food stamps, in part because they think that people on food stamps can't afford the Costco card. There's this misconception that everyone on food stamps is destitute. If you have a family, and make under 24 thousand dollars a year, you qualify. That's a school crossing guard's salary. What about LA's fast food ban--you were reported as being in favor of similar measures in New York. Can you explain your stance on that? Look, I think that's extreme. That being said, when you look at the long term health consequences of these terrible diets, the heart disease, the cost for public hospitals, the lost productivity, I think everything should be on the table, and we should applaud creative thinking. I don't blame them for thinking out of the box. I think it's hard for people to fathom that hunger is a problem. But hunger and obesity are two sides of the same coin. Can you explain how hunger and obesity are related? When you're poor and hungry, and your kids are hungry, you'll do anything you can to put food in that belly, the more the better. You'll go for big, processed cheese-like strips, the lightest, cheapest bread, whole milk rather than skim milk. You can buy a two liter bottle of coke for a dollar, but milk costs 5 bucks. It's not that people don't know the healthy choices, the decision is made for them by the prices on the foods. How do you respond to people who say that it's patronizing to say tell certain segments of the population what to eat? I think that's partly right. But I also think that predators often wrap them in the liberty of their victim. You talk to folks who lost their home: It was their right to sign those documents. You have to balance liberty and governance. We really do have to be creative. I think of your district as being a particularly good place to eat. Where do you like to go out to eat? I grew up in the neighborhood, and my family been there 100 years, but I'm still finding new places. We found a place on Saturday called My Thai [8347 Dongan Avenue, Elmhurst]. That was fantastic, really good Thai food. Then there's Manetta's [10-76 Jackson Avenue, Long Island City]. If you like non-fancy Italian, like grandma would make on Sunday, that's the place. They were closed for two weeks. I almost starved! My wife is Cuban and she thinks El Sitio [68-28 Roosevelt Avenue, Woodside] is the best Cuban in the city. There are great Indian places...and Donovan's [5724 Roosevelt Avenue, Woodside] has great pub food. You can't go wrong in my neighborhood.

Good thing Eric's not dictating nutrition policy! Drinking whole milk rather than skim milk makes sense for several reasons. It lasts longer, tastes better, is much more nutritious, and many studies have shown that low-fat diets are useless for weight loss and disease prevention.

All the news that's fit to eat. John McCain likes it hot: Yesterday afternoon, John McCain and running mate Sarah Palin showed up at El Pinto, a popular Albuquerque restaurant. McCain bought two jars of the restaurant's famous salsa, in medium and hot, and Palin bought medium green chile sauce and roasted green chile. The hot food strategy did not work so well for Hillary Clinton. [AP] Gordon Ramsay will never go away: Today, Ramsay told the Post that he's planning on opening a restaurant similar to his London gastro-pub, Foxtrot Oscar, in New York. In the interview, he compares Foxtrot Oscar to the Spotted Pig, an analogy that might not go over well with some. Ramsay's first New York restaurant, Gordon Ramsay at the London, was met with muted reviews. [NY Post] Todd English's newest restaurant, The Libertine, opened this weekend in the Gild Hall hotel. Resys are available on Open Table. The menu is full of things like foot-long kobe franks. You get the idea. Richard Blais, the faux-hawked Top Cheffer, has resigned as executive chef at Home, a restaurant in the Buckhead neighborhood of Atlanta, to focus full-time on FLIP, his new fancy burger project. [Access Atlanta] Famed Spanish chef Toñi Vicente has been arrested for buying illegal scallops. [Typically Spanish] Bentonville, Arkansas gets its first Indian/Pakistani restaurant today—and even before the doors open, the owner's been fielding orders. [Benton County Daily Record]

POST:
So much to eat... Serious Eats' Adam Kuban came across this list called The Omnivore's 100—a quirky run-down of foods that every omnivore should try at least once—everything from bagels and lox to whole bugs and Hostess fruit pies. Very Good Taste, the UK-based blog that came up with the idea, asks that other bloggers copy the list, bolding the items you've eaten and crossing out the items you wouldn't consider eating. Fun stuff. Lists beget more lists, so I thought I'd put together a Traveling Omnivore's 20: A run-down of my 20 top, must-have, location-specific eats. I've bolded the ones I've tried. What would you add? What have you tried? 1. Assam laksa in Singapore 2. Barbecued brisket in Texas 3. Uni sushi in Tokyo 4. Fried fish tacos in Ensenada, Baja Mexico 5. Pav Bhaji in Bombay 6. Stuffed quahogs on Cape Cod 7. Wine in Sonoma Valley 8. Beef rendang in Indonesia 9. Pizza in New York 10. Grilled steak in Argentina 11. Boudin noir in Paris 12. Fried oyster po'boy in New Orleans 13. Banh beo in Vietnam 14. Braaied game in South Africa 15. Prawn curry in Goa 16. Hot pot in Szechuan province 17. A carnitas taco from a taco truck in LA 18. Jerked chicken in Jamaica 19. Barbecued burnt ends in Kansas City 20. Single-malt scotch in Scotland

Paula Deen's gonna fatten her right up. Sarah Palin makes me want to throw my television out the window and start setting shit on fire. Luckily for my neighbors, an email from the Food Network arrived just in time to calm me down. Just gaze at the picture above, breathe into a paper bag and think of hot lard. See? All better now. On Paula Deen's Sept. 20th show (titled "Grease is the Word," of course), Deen will help Michelle Obama get down with the people by teaching her how to fry. I love Paula Deen...reluctantly. Her show isn't so fantastic, but her voice is better than Valium. Just close your eyes and listen: "And now a halfa pounda butta....And some cream...And we're gonna fry that up in hot laaard." And if she's helping Michelle Obama reach out to lovers of Southern fried food, all the better. From the press release: And Barak makes a mean chili! You hear that red staters? What's more American than making a mean chili? I mean...besides American traditions like the high success rate of abstinence-only education, banning books from school libraries and mocking the silly notion of reading prisoners their rights. But chili is right up there! On Saturday September 20th at 7:00pm ET/PT, Michelle gives Paula a taste of her family life on the road to the White House and shares fun facts, including the first meal she made for Barack, what kinds of local foods the family seeks out on the road and that Barack makes a mean chili! And, with Paula showing her secrets for frying up some popular American comfort foods, this is one party viewers won’t want to miss!

Oh how we forget. The right always seems to have a selected memory problem. Let me refresh you. Remember when McCain said that Chelsey Clinton was ugly because she was Janet Reno's mother. Now if you want to go there we can. It's bad enough when women to it to each other but when a man mocks a child than it shows what a gossip cheap man he really is. Her child having a baby was brought up first by Ms Palin. She brings her baggage into the show. How long did the right wing go after the Clintons nonstop. So please don't give us your high and might tone. What goes around comes around.

Ultra-Cheap Lunch! Lunch Box Buffet

POST:
Hey big spender! Clockwise from bottom left: Tofu in black bean sauce, rice, tofu in soy sauce, bean curd skin-wrapped chicken, cold eggplant The rising cost of food and the precarious financial status of most restaurants continues to be a big story, with the NYT weighing in again today on the subject. (To summarize: Rich Europeans are the only big spenders now...Restaurants will soon be overbooking reservations just like airlines...sigh.) So to cheer up, we're turning to cheap lunch—reviews of places that you can actually afford. Lunch under $10 is a fairly big category. Lunch under $5 is much harder—especially if you want a plate with some variety, something more than a couple dumplings or a hot dog on the street. I was curious about Lunch Box Buffet (195 Centre Street), which sports a yellow awning that screams the bargain: $4.50 eat in/$4 take out for a five-item plate. You pay first, and the cashier will ask if you want white rice. Keep in mind that the rice will count as one of your five choices. The room is lined with a very long steam table buffet, containing the rest of your choices, and tended to by stern ladies who dish it out. Wander around the room and check out the options before you decide. Some dishes look decidedly better than others. If you're a fan of those lacquered, sesame-seeded, fried chunks of indeterminate meat common at Chinese-American places, you're in serious luck. But there are other dishes that are worthwhile. I especially liked the big slab of fried tofu in black bean-garlic sauce. Yes, the sauce had a little more cornstarch than it should have, but it also had big slices of garlic, salty black beans, diced carrot and ginger. I also liked the cold, garlicky eggplant and the bean curd skin wrapped around dark-meat chicken. Much of the food here is mediocre, but if you choose carefully, you're rewarded with an enormous plate of pretty good food for less than the price of one of those big, crazy drinks at Starbucks. Plus, the amount on each plate is absolutely enough for two, and if you're sneaky about it (or you do takeout with a friend) you can share, bringing the cost down to $2.

Rhong-Tiam: No high design, just great food This week, Our Man Sietsema and I both write about Bangkok-style eats—which we think is about to supplant Issan cookery as the next big thing in New York Thai food. I review Rhong-Tiam, Andy Yang's unexpected phenom of a restaurant, where he serves the foods of his home city, Bangkok. If you order carefully, you can have a completely wonderful, vivid meal here. Much has been written about the restaurant's Pork on Fire, and you should believe the hype. In the case of Yang's Kurve, though, (which I didn't review but simply tried to make sense of) hype is all the restaurant's got. Kurve's saga is one of the more ridiculous series of events ever—Yang threw an opening party for Kurve and announced that the place was open. But when I went, the empty space and odd food choices were so bizarre that I called and asked Yang what was up. He then claimed that the restaurant was not open, and that for the past couple weeks they had been just testing out the AC and computer systems. I get reimbursed for the cost of my meals by the Voice. But others would have gone in and spent their own hard-earned money on a restaurant that the owner didn't consider open yet, even though the doors were open and the stoves were turning out food. I call foul. Meanwhile, Our Man Sietsema reviews Am-Thai Chili Basil Kitchen in Kensington, Brooklyn, and this is a straight-up rave. Our Man adores the Bangkok-style dishes here, and reports that the menu is awash in coconut milk: Our Man notes that duck is also "an obsession" of the (large) menu, and in the quacking category ( I should say mock-quacking, since this one is made with mock duck), he finds one of his favorite dishes of the year. Get there! But the most impressive use of coconut milk is in the tom kha gai soup ($4), a Bangkok favorite that had my pals moaning in ecstasy. We made a beeline for duck herbal ($13) and had one of the best things we'd tasted this year, a stir fry of pressed duck with a super-crunchy texture and inviting garnet hue, exuberantly flavored with bushels of green herbs (kaffir lime leaves, tiny pungent basil blossoms, smashed lemongrass, green onions, and cilantro) in a sweet fishy glaze.

 Here's a plywood site that might be of interest to Midtown Lunchers: B Bap, a new "fusion rice bar" (whatever that means) on 9th Avenue between 55th and 54th, on the east side of the street. Bap means "cooked rice" in Korean, so I'd guess a Korean bent.

<img alt="salad.jpg" src="http://blogs.villagevoice.com/forkintheroad/salad.jpg"align="left" hspace-"4" width="225" /> I avoid ordering fresh tomatoes when they're not in season, mostly for selfish taste reasons—pink, hard, mealy tomatoes make me want to gag. But right now is the height of tomato season in pretty much all of the lower 48 states, when almost any old tomato tastes halfway decent. So why, Gemma, why are you serving these little crunchy pink bits? This would have been a nice salad: warm grilled calamari, radicchio, avocado. But the diced tomatoes tasted like they were from December. And this happens all the time! Bad tomatoes are hiding out in sandwiches and salads as we speak. Doesn't it seem like you'd have to go out of your way to even get a bad tomato right now? Meh. Carry on.

Roadtrip: Frank Pepe's Pizza

POST:
Frank Pepe's white clam pie Interstate 95-South on the Monday of a holiday weekend is like the ninth circle of hell. But amid the miles and miles of backed-up traffic creeping towards New York, there is, at least, something great to eat. Frank Pepe's Pizza Napoletana has two locations that are right off 95, so you can call in an order, pick it up quicker than it takes to go through the McDonald's drive-through, and continue on your way with one of the region's best pizzas, hot out of the coal oven, in your lap. We stopped at the Frank Pepe's location in Fairfield, CT. I've never been to the original, so I can't say how they compare. But if the original produces pizzas that are even a little bit better than the Fairfield version...those would be insanely delicious pies. We had the white clam pie—freshly shucked whole clams (with their liquor), olive oil, garlic, parsley and breadcrumbs—and the fresh tomato pie, a summer special featuring chopped tomatoes, mozzarella, garlic, basil and olive oil. Frank Pepe's pizzas are cooked in a gigantic coal oven, as big as some Manhattan apartments. A cache of big, rough chunks of coal spills out of a storage alcove, and is shoveled into the glowing fire with a big shovel. The high-heat coal fire gives the pizzas a smoky aroma and crisp, brown-spotted crust. The clam pie, Frank Pepe's specialty, is justifiably famous— briny, buttery clams, heaps of fresh garlic on a chewy, crispy crust. The tomato pie was also pretty spectacular, but the tomatoes give off a lot of moisture, making the crust less crisp. Frank Pepe's has been around since 1925, and has three locations. The first two listed are just a block or two off I-95. 157 Wooster Street New Haven, CT 203-865-5762 238 Commerce Drive Fairfield, CT 203-333-7373 221 Buckland Hills Drive Manchester, CT 860-644-7333 Fresh tomato pie

The Fairfield pizzeria doesn't compare to the New Haven original. You should've stayed on I-95 a little longer. The tomato pizza in New Haven is superior to the clam pie, and it doesn't throw off excess water. BTW, what's this obsession with "crisp" crust? Chewy and not charred is the napoletano ideal. See: Baci & Abbracci in Williamsburg.

Recipe Improv with Convivio Chef Michael White

POST:
Chef Michael White with a pork shoulder in the kitchen This week, we're playing Recipe Improv with Michael White, executive chef and partner at Alto and Convivio. White trained extensively in Italy (where he met his wife). His first New York gig was as the executive chef of Fiamma Osteria, and last year, he moved over to L’Impero (which he re-made into Convivio) and Alto. We're feeling fall-ish, so we asked chef White to make us something hearty featuring our three mystery ingredients. The Ingredients Pork shoulder bourbon currants The Recipe Slow Roasted Pork Shoulder Yield: 8 servings 1/4 cup Kentucky bourbon 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar 1/4 cup currant preserves 6 large cloves garlic, smashed 1/4 cup Dijon mustard 2 sprigs fresh rosemary, de-stemmed 1 (6 pound) boned pork shoulder salt and freshly ground pepper In blender or food processor, combine bourbon, olive oil, balsamic vinegar, currant preserves, garlic, mustard and rosemary; pulse until marinade is smooth. Place pork shoulder and marinade in a food storage bag and refrigerate overnight. The next day, preheat the oven to 275 degrees. Remove the pork from the bag, drain excess liquid, and season generously with salt and pepper. Put pork in a roasting pan, and place pan on a rack in the middle of the oven. Cook for 7 to 8 hours or until the pork has reached 165 degrees internally, and is no longer pink in the center, basting occasionally with cooking liquid. Slice into 1/4-inch thick slices. Serve with your favorite contorni (side dish) or slice thin for great panini.

Sietsema: A Short History of the Eggplant
AUTHOR:
Sarah DiGregorio
DATE:
2008-10-16 15:49:00
POST:
Our Man Sietsema is about to drop some knowledge. He's been alone in the kitchen with an eggplant, thinking deep thoughts about this veggie, which is in season right now. Pretty. Eggplant is native to India, where it has been cultivated for 4000 years. Known as aubergine in France and England, the plant is a member of the Solanaceae family, which includes such other nightshades as potatoes and tomatoes. As with tomatoes, it might be more properly called a fruit. But why is it called eggplant? While a pear-shaped purple type has long been dominant in this country, dozens of cultivars exist in colors ranging from off-white to streaky pink to blackish purple. And, yes, some are the size, shape, and color of eggs, leading them to be called "garden eggs" in Africa. The photo shows the varieties collected in a single afternoon at the Union Square Farmers Market. Arab traders brought the eggplant to Europe and Africa around 1400. The vegetable was introduced into the United States by Thomas Jefferson, who either got the seeds from France, or from slaves recently arrived from Africa -- who did all the actual gardening at Monticello. Jefferson experimented with eggplant, and his 1812 journal lists both purple and white eggplants among nearly 350 crops. Jefferson apparently had no idea what to do with the vegetable, but by the 1840s, it was a prominent part of the southern diet, roasted and stuffed with either breadcrumbs or rice. It wasn't until immigrants from the Middle East and Italy brought their recipes for eggplant to America late in the 19th century that it began to be a popular vegetable, though its popularity was still confined mainly to the East Coast and the South throughout much of the 20th century. Compared with other vegetables, eggplant takes a long time to grow, which is why it doesn't appear in farmers markets until September. The selection of seven seen above includes heirloom varieties from Italy and Japan. While East Asians prefer slender elongated varieties, Middle Easterners like the more rotund types, which can be roasted to yield baba ganoush, or the copious flesh diced to make salads. The most famous Turkish recipe is imam bayildi -- sliced eggplant roasted with a topping of tomatoes, garlic, and olive oil. The name translates "the imam fainted." As the story goes, the imam (a Muslim religious leader) lost consciousness either because the dish tasted so good, or because the olive oil used in the recipe was so expensive. The Spanish prefer small white eggplants, and often pickle them so that they look and feel like pickled eggs. Thais also use eggplants the size of chicken eggs; however, theirs are green and streaky like watermelons. Sichuanese stir-fry eggplant cubes with garlic, hot chiles, and Sichuan peppercorns. Southern Italians like eggplants as much as Turks and Chinese; in fact, when a pasta is described as Sicilian-style, it often contains diced eggplant in addition to tomatoes and mozzarella. The eggplant parmigiana hero is certainly one of the highest attainments of Italian-American cuisine. The word for eggplant in Italian is melanzana, which derives from the Latin expression "mala insana," which means "apple of madness." And, while we're inordinately fond of eggplants, we can't quite say that they drive us insane.

"when a pasta is described as Sicilian-style, it often contains diced eggplant in addition to tomatoes and mozzarella..." Well, not exactly. Pasta alla norma is made with eggplant, but the cheese is ricotta salata, not mozzarella, which would make it more Neapolitan. And how could you forget caponata, the sublime Sicilian eggplant dish that many New York restaurants now serve (albeit often in less than authentic versions)? I grew up eating it and, if I may brag, I make an excellent version in late summer/early fall when the Union Square Greenmarket has great melanzane, celery with real flavor (unlike the tasteless supermarket stuff)and plum tomatoes.

 Danny Meyer has been on our minds lately, as the uptown Shake Shack gets closer and closer to opening. The latest official word is that it will open sometime in the next week and a half, and that they're just waiting for final permits. We caught up with Meyer and ask him our patented, Barbara Walters-esque Four Questions Not About Food. What was the last book you read and did you enjoy it? The Man Who Ate the World by Jay Rayner. Well written and wry, but I found it completely depressing, beginning with the premise that there is in fact a "perfect" meal to be had somewhere in the world - if only one is intrepid, hungry, affluent, and smart enough to hunt for it. Sort of ruins the notion of a spontaneous Friday night date. What animal would you like to be reincarnated as and why? Panther. Powerful, quick, smart, lithe, beautiful, hungry. Choose a superpower. Love. What did you dream about last night? Sarah Palin had been elected chair of the school auction committee and I was a volunteer. I was trying to convince people that an auction item featuring a day of moose-hunting with Palin would sell for a lot more if it were followed by a feast of moose cooked by Tabla's Chef Floyd Cardoz. She thought the day of hunting with her would stand better on its own. I argued that New Yorkers were food people, and that Floyd's Curried Moose could sell for a lot of money. I then told her that last year we had a very successful live auction item where Floyd had cooked birds shot by Dick Cheney. I never got a response because then I woke up.

Sietsema's Cheap Eats: Gol Guppe
AUTHOR:

POST:
What do we want? Cheap eats. When do we want them? Now! If you're hungry for something delicious but your bank account is in the red, we're here to help you out (see our Cheap Lunch!) series—Our Man Sietsema has been sniffing out the good stuff. Here's Our Man on a fun and inexpensive variety of chaat—a category of Indian snack. (And check out Fork in the Road's Manhattan chaat roundup in the November 12th paper.)  Gol guppe is the happy-go-lucky Punjabi nickname for a snack known elsewhere in India as pani poori. It consists of a half-dozen or more tiny flattened globes that resemble miniature pooris. These pooris, however, are not pliable and greasy, but as hard as fingernails. They come accompanied by a salad of potatoes and chickpeas lubricated with tamarind and cilantro chutneys, making gol gappey a species of chaat, an Indian word for composite snack. To eat: break open a gol guppe with the wrong end of your plastic spoon, then shoot a teaspoonful of filling into the breach. Next, pour in as much of the accompanying tamarind water into the poori as you dare, then ferry the assemblage to your lips as fast as you can – since the tamarind water will already be leaking out, causing great hilarity among your dining companions. The tricky consumption of this snack constitutes a sort of game: Never let anyone tell you not to play with your food! The tamarind water, which is spicy and salty and cool on the tongue, makes a nice beverage afterwards – which is lucky, because you’ll never manage to pour all of it into the pooris. Find this wonderful snack at Pavitra, which sounds like an erectile dysfunction medicine, but is really a new chaat house and sweets parlor in Richmond Hill, just west of the Van Wyck Expressway. It’s a great place to stop for your airline meal on the way to Kennedy Airport. 135-08 Liberty Avenue, Queens, 718-206-0666. The cost: $3.

But as I walked around I realized how wrong I was—it's true that there were random supermarket-ish samples à la the Fancy Food Show, but there was also tons of booze–wine, sake, beer and cocktails. Not only that, but some very good chefs were there, offering samples of some very good food. The highlights, as I ate them: Bluefish escabeche with pumpkin and fennel from chef Ben Pollinger of Oceana Hampshire pork bratwurst with chow chow and brown ale mustard from Cookshop's Marc Meyer Seafood ceviche from Hudson Cafe's Mark Spangenthal Barbecue beef sliders with pickled okra and hot chiles from Hill Country A NYC sour from Maker's Mark The whole shebang on a beautiful day

NY Wine and Food Fest: Meatpacking Uncorked Recap

POST:
Here you have pictures of Meatpacking Uncorked, one of the New York Wine and Food Festival's events on Friday night.  Basically, for $40, you got your wristband, and then wandered around the Meatpacking, where the fancy shmancy shops were open late and pouring tastes of wine.  There was something sort of strange about shuffling past $3,000 lingerie at La Perla to get your sip of Coppola Chardonnay. It was kind of fun to wander around Moschino, looking at fluffy blue jackets and gold stilettos while sipping Mionetto Prosecco and listening to Michael Jackson. I noticed a higher percentage of older folks at Design Within Reach, where you could rest on a midcentury modern couch while drinking your Malbec, while the beautiful, giraffe-like people clopped down the cobblestones outside.  In the end, a relatively fun way to start an evening, but not one of the festival's best events The wines being poured were mostly tasty but unremarkable. I can think of better wine-related ways to spend $40.

Yay, America Big bread for lean times: Pepperidge Farm is launching "family-sized" value loaves of its Farmhouse soft breads this fall in response to the economy. [FitR inbox] More recession eating (kinda): Bar Blanc is now offering a $38, 3-course prix fixe menu on Sunday nights. [FitR inbox] Open: On the UES, Opus (1574 Second Avenue) is now open, peddling a mostly gluten-free menu, including pizzas made with gluten-free flour imported from Italy. (Whoever heard of such a thing?) But the place is open late, until 5am every night, so now you know where to go when you have a late-night craving for gluten-free pizza. [FitR inbox] Really? Cooking Light sends along election night menus for Republicans, Democrats, and that strange subspecies, the "undecideds." Unfortunately, while Republicans get roasted red pepper soup and beef tenderloin with mustard and herbs, in the Cooking Light plan, Democrats have to content themselves with a meal composed almost entirely of blue cheese and blueberries. [FitR inbox] Oh God: Borgata Hotel Casino and Spa in Atlantic City is featuring election-themed cocktails. The Ciroc Obama combines the vodka with blue curacao and Sprite. The McCainarita is a margarita with pomegranate juice. The Miss Independent is described like this: "For all those nonpartisan types, this one is, like, totally hot! Show your independence with a Stoli Raspberri Cosmo and lemon garnish served up in a martini glass." Make it stop. [FitR inbox]

Sietsema on Two New Korean Chains
AUTHOR:
Sarah DiGregorio
DATE:
2008-10-9 15:47:00
POST:
Today, Our Man Sietsema goes and checks out two new Korean spots. He weighs in on the trend of foreign chains popping up in New York, (Koreans bringing hot dogs to New York?) and noshes on bulgogi dogs and fried chicken. Get the goods, below.   The crunchy-skinned plain ($5.95 for two pieces plus baking-powder biscuit) tasted clean and slightly nutty, but we couldn’t help noticing that the skin had been removed, ostensibly for health reasons, which may also be the rationale behind the use of olive oil. (All Korean friend chicken franchises claim to be “healthy.”) Who’s eating the skin? we wondered. It’s the best part. The glazed chicken was terrible, tasting like it had been dunked in corn syrup infused with jelly beans. Sides included battered waffle fries and mac and cheese engulfed in a Cheez Whiz-type sauce. Hard to believe there’s no transfats in there, further undermining the health claims. Fads aside, neither of these new places offer much of a deal, charging a premium for novelty. Although, at $5.99 plus tax, I guess the bulgogi dog might be considered a relatively cheap meal. Just don’t order sides or a beverage. New York Hot Dog and Coffee (245 Bleecker Street, 917-388-2608); BBQ Chicken (26 St. Marks Place, 212-982-9616) In a recent piece for the fall preview issue, I inveigled against the invasion of New York by chain restaurants, and more specifically, foreign chains from Korea, Singapore, the Netherlands, and Japan, a result of the weakening dollar and the attractive vitality of the New York restaurant scene to foreign investors. I also complained about the carbon footprint of fast food sourced on the other side of the globe. One signifier of this trend was New York Hot Dog and Coffee, a Korean chain which replaced a longstanding Italian pastry shop on Bleecker Street, posing the question, Can’t New Yorkers make their own damn hot dogs? The place was in what Eater calls the “plywood stage” for many months, but now that it’s finally open, a friend and I had a chance to sample the hot dogs. I’ve got to sheepishly admit, even David Chang probably can’t make hot dogs quite like that. Best was the bulgogi dog ($5.99), a bulging, artificial-skin frank stuck in a puffy bun with pickles, lettuce, and a good quantity of sautéed bulgogi beef dusted with sesame seeds. The dog – a bloated ball park frank, rather than New York’s slender, natural-skin wieners – came in two subspecies: mild and hot, with the hot preferred; the bulgogi beef topping was also spicy. The dak-kalbi ($5.99, shown above), a chicken frank topped with “barbecued” chicken was not as impressive; both dog and topping were bland and undersalted. The plain beef frank with mustard and sauerkraut (also shown) was fairly tasty, and, at $2.99, nearly equal in volume to a pair of New York franks from Gray’s Papaya ($2.50), and not quite as good, with no resounding pop when you bite down on it. On a roll, my friend and I also sought out BBQ Chicken, a Korean chicken joint that recently opened on St. Marks after long delays. In common with similar chains already operating in Flushing, Jackson Heights, Koreatown, and Chambers Street, two types of chicken are offered: plain and hot and spicy. The innovation that BBQ Chicken offers is frying in virgin olive oil. When we arrived at the narrow space (which boasts a comfortable, fashion-forward dining room in the rear and a couple of tables on the street), the air was suffused with the odor of olive oil, so that with eyes closed you might think you were in an Italian trattoria.

NY Best Markets: Han Ah Reum
AUTHOR:
Sarah DiGregorio
DATE:
2008-10-9 10:26:00
POST:
 The Han Ah Reum Korean market on the 32nd Street Koreatown stretch is, as far as I have found, the best Korean grocery in Manhattan. (There's a bigger, better Han Ah Reum in Flushing, the neighborhood with the most delicious things per square mile.) The Manhattan Han Ah Reum branch manages to squeeze all the components of a proper supermarket—produce, fresh meat, fish, prepared foods, grocery items, frozen foods—into a relatively small space, so it gets a little cramped. But it's a great place to wander the aisles, looking for new things to try, or just stop by and grab a kimchi pancake for a snack. Plus, it's open until midnight, so if you're having a drink at the Me Bar on the roof of the nearby La Quita Inn (a bizaare but lovable spot and my favorite rooftop bar in the city), you can stop by here for a snack. Best Buys: Holland red chiles: Sometimes it's hard to find the fresh, long, ripe red chiles that add both sweetness and heat to Korean dishes. Find them here in plastic-wrapped styrofoam trays, very fresh. $7 per pound Pork bulgogi: Fatty strips of raw pork, marinated in plenty of garlic, soybean paste, chiles and soy sauce. Take it home, sizzle it up over medium-high heat and wrap it in lettuce to eat. Instant Korean barbecue. $4.99/pound Ssam Jang: Grab a container of this sauce to go with your bulgogi. The thick, reddish-brown paste is made of fermented soybeans, chiles and plenty of garlic. It's salty, spicy and deeply savory. Smear it on your meat before you wrap it up in lettuce. Sunchang Brand $4.99 Soy eggs: Find these in the refrigerated banchan (Korean side dish) section. The eggs are cooked in soy sauce, water and sugar, so they're like boiled eggs but much better. $3.99 per pack Frozen mandoo: Grab a big bag of frozen kimchi mandoo (dumplings) and microwave or steam them at home. Bobu Food Co. 8.99 per approx 2.5 pound bag Unagi: Also in the refrigerated section, you can find vacuum-packed bags of whole filets of grilled, seasoned eel, similar to the kind that you get at a sushi bar, sticky with a dark, sweet-salty sauce. All you have to do is bake it and serve. $7.99 per pack Han Ah Reum 25 W 32nd St # 1 212-695-3283

Trend Alert: Pastrami Everything
AUTHOR:
Sarah DiGregorio
DATE:
2008-10-8 14:26:00
POST:
Yes, please I've always been a fan of Acme Smoked Fish's pastrami smoked salmon; the silky smoked fish seems like a natural match for that assertive, coarse black pepper-coriander rub. And now two new Brooklyn restaurants are pastrami-ing unorthodox meats. (The classic New York pastrami is made from brined brisket, rubbed with spices. Although, apparently, Romanians have always made pastrami out of mutton or pork.) At Char No.4 (196 Smith Street), chef Matt Greco makes a house-cured lamb pastrami. I tried this recently, and it is wonderful. The lamb is sliced so thin that the pinkish strips are almost transparent, and is served with coriander aioli and rye bread. The faint gaminess of the lamb goes well with the floral-herbal-sharpness of the black peppercorns, coriander and juniper seeds. And at Bussaco (833 Union Street) Chef Matthew Schaefer (formerly of Le Bernardin) is curing duck breast pastrami, which is served with homemade sauerkraut and black bread stuffing. I haven't had this yet, but it sounds promising.

Fork in the Road Gorging in Red Hook

POST:
This is delicious This week, I check out some of the new and new-ish spots in Red Hook. But don't worry! This is not yet another 'Red Hook is About to Be Gentrified!' story. Actually, I think that Red Hook will always be a little rough and remote, IKEA or no. It's a neighborhood that stubbornly retains its distinctive, salty character, even as most neighborhoods in Manhattan and Brooklyn become more and more homogenous. Highlights of new eats in Red Hook include Neil Ganic's La Bouillabaisse. The restaurant is often empty, and the space is decorated in an inexplicably stuffy manner, but the bouillabaisse is really, truly excellent. The bowl is fragrant of garlic, saffron and white wine, and it's packed with a half a Maine lobster, dozens of mussels, a heap of scallops and pink Gulf shrimp. For $22, it's one of the best, most fair-priced seafood gorges I've ever had. In the story, I also hit up Annabelle's, Brooklyn Ice House, Tini and Botanica. And...maybe a quick stop at IKEA. Because I like their meatballs.

Our Man Sietsema and the 'Jiz Biz' 
AUTHOR:
Sarah DiGregorio

2008-10-8 9:14:00
POST:
 Never one to let a dirty joke go untold, Our Man Sietsema has a good time recounting his exploits at Cafe Sim Sim, where the veal organs are called "Jiz Biz," and where, sadly, the proprietor was all out of testicle stew. Okay, but other than the ball jokes, how was the food? Cafe Sim Sim is in Kensington, Brooklyn, and specializes in Russian and Caucasian food (not white people food but cuisine of the region that includes Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan). This excites Our Man very much, as he hasn't seen a Caucasian restaurant in Kensington for a while. He gets a big group together, and they sample a banquet's worth of food. The highlights: That sounds a lot better than balls to me. Removed from the skewers, the kebabs sail in on a single long platter, with the meat heaped around excellent, dill-decorated french fries. With our party of eight, the platter was the size of a small Russian tank...One of our favorites was lulya kebab, ground lamb shot with onions. As succulent as an overripe piece of fruit, each meat torpedo came wrapped in a ribbon of thin flatbread that might be mistaken for a Flushing Avenue tortilla. And, man—meat doesn't get much better than that. Pork-neck kebab was the very best, big gobbets of coarsely textured meat glistening with fat.

Sietsema's Cheap Eats: Mole Pipian

POST:
Breathing into a paper bag over the bad money news? Have no fear, we've got mountains of delicious cheap food in New York (see our Cheap Lunch! series), and Our Man Sietsema sniffs it out everyday. Sietsema's Cheap Eats school is once again in session.  A tender half chicken lies smothered in mole pipian – a sauce that was invented by Mexican Indians long before the Conquistadores showed up and introduced Spanish flourishes to Mexican cooking. Made from ground pumpkinseeds, the mole is spicy and mellow at the same time and utterly delicious, despite its slightly disturbing green color. The sauce is made from scratch at New Tulcingo Restaurant (1035 Manhattan Avenue, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, 718-349-0033), and comes accompanied by plainish pinto beans and moist yellow rice, with a plate of fresh white-corn tortillas so you can eat the meal as a series of makeshift wraps. The price: $6.75.

New This Week: Naya
AUTHOR:
Sarah DiGregorio
DATE:
2008-10-7 9:47:00
POST:
 This is a big week in New York eating. The first New York Wine and Food Festival starts on Thursday, and there have been lots of high-profile restaurant openings lately, like Corton (from restaurateur Drew Nieporent and chef Paul Liebrandt) and A Q Cafe, the new spinoff from Marcus Samuelsson's Scandinavia House spot. This week, we've got Naya opening tomorrow night for dinner. The modern Lebanese food is by Chef Rafic Nehme, who comes straight from his own 25-year-old restaurant, Iyem Zaman, in Mount Lebanon. The owner, Hady Kfoury, has worked at Daniel, as well as several restaurants in his native Lebanon. The menu is heavy on the mezze, like hommus, baba ghannouj, pan-seared halloumi cheese, kibbe and Lebanese-style steak tartar. (Mezze $6-$10) Mains run from beef shawarma to kafta kabob to striped bass topped with spicy tahini and walnuts. (Mains $17-27) Sounds like this could be an interesting spot, but it's in a tough location (1057 Second Avenue at 55th Street). Here's hoping it doesn't die the quick death of Savarona, the high-end Turkish spot (with very good food) that once sat in the shadow of the Queensboro Bridge.

If believe the hysterical, screaming heads on the television, it seems like our economy's down the tubes, kids. Never fear, there are plenty of completely delicious cheap eats in New York (see our Cheap Lunch! series), and Our Man Sietsema knows all, tells all. Sit down now, and be quiet. Robert Sietsema's about to school you in cheap eats. And he'll do it again tomorrow.  Who can resist a mountain of southern Chinese charcuterie? You’ve got crackly-skinned roast pig on the left, dark and flavorful roast duck on the right, and a bit of steamed pea shoots and cauliflower around the periphery to make you feel virtuous – all deposited on vast quantities of white rice. Oh, and make sure you request the homemade ginger-scallion sauce, which the duck wrangler spoons on top, along with a drizzle of sweet dark Chinese barbecue sauce at Wah Fung #1 Fast Food (79 Chrystie Street, no phone). You could easily share this meal with a friend, but why not eat the whole thing yourself? The price: $3.75

 The official announcement of the 2009 Michelin Guide for New York City is happening in about 10 minutes at the Astor Center. But over at Eater, they've snagged the star picks in advance via undercover camera phone photos. Devious, they are! No big surprises in the three-star category, but newcomer Momofuku Ko shows up with two stars, as does Adour. 3 Stars Jean Georges Le Bernardin Masa Per Se 2 Stars Adour Daniel Del Posto Gilt Gordon Ramsay Momofuku Ko Picholine 1 Star  Allen & Delancey Alto  Annisa  Anthos  Aureole  Blue Hill  Cafe Boulud  Cru  Dressler  81  Etats unis  Fiamma  Fleur de Sel  Gotham Bar and Grill  Grammercy Tavern  Insieme  Jewel Bako  JoJo  Kyo Ya  Robuchon  Modern  Oceana  Perry Street  Peter Luger  Public  Saul  Spotted Pig  Sushi of Gari  Veritas  Wallse  wd-50

 South Park Slope, Brooklyn, is about to get their very own Atomic Wings, opening soon on Ninth Street between Fifth and Sixth Avenues. [FitR] The New York Wine and Food Festival kicks off this Thursday, with the Chelsea Market After Dark event, (which, unfortunately, is sold out). But there are plenty of other events all weekend long that still have tickets available. Check back here for coverage of the festival. Ted Allen won't be on the Top Chef judging panel this coming season. He's been replaced by British food critic Toby Young. [Baltimore Sun] The Black Frog restaurant in Greenville Maine is no longer offering customers free sandwiches if they strip and swim naked in the nearby Moosehead Lake. The free skinny dip sandwich was nixed after town selectmen wouldn't renew the restaurant's liquor license. [Boston Herald]

Cheap Lunch! Eton Dumplings
AUTHOR:

POST:
Dumplings! They come five to an order ($3.50), but I ate one on the way home. Eton Chan is making some very nice dumplings at his new shop in Carroll Gardens. The storefront is small, with just a few stools by the window. The small kitchen sits in the middle of the room, behind a counter, so you can watch the cooks smash garlic and dice scallions, and you hear your dumplings when they hit the oil and start to sizzle. There are just three varieties: pork and beef with cabbage, chicken and mushroom and vegetable tofu. I stopped by today and got one order of pork/beef and one of vegetable. The dumplings are large, almost the size of my fist and come five dumplings to a $3.50 order. One order would be enough for a light lunch, two orders if you're hungrier. The dumplings are first pan-fried, then steamed, so that one side of the dumpling skin is brown and crispy, and the others are white, soft and slightly chewy. They come to you piping hot, cooked to order (you'll probably have to wait 10 minutes for them to be ready). I especially liked the pork/beef variety. The homemade wrappers give way into a bouncy meatball that gushes juice under your teeth. The vegetable-tofu were less delicious, stuffed with a dull cabbage-carrot-lentil mixture that was very underseasoned; plus, they fell apart easily, shedding cabbage everywhere. But Eton makes a spicy-sweet plum sauce (you can buy a bottle for $4); dousing the vegetarian dumplings in that sauce improves matters. There's also Hawaiian shave ice, in sweet fruit flavors, which you can top with things like red beans, marshmallow fluff or condensed milk. Eton's shave ice season, though, is about to be over on October 31st. It will be replaced by noodle soups, featuring hand-pulled noodles augmented with braised short ribs and pork belly. Look for the soups starting in November. Eton 205 Sackett Street 718-222-2999 Dumpling guts

Black Iron Burger

POST:
 Here she is, your Black Iron Burger. I stopped in for lunch today to see what all the fuss was over the $8,000 Keating Miraclean griddle. Apparently, this thing doesn't ever get seasoned, so the first burger cooked on it should taste the same as one cooked on it ten years from now. Usually, any cook will tell you that meat sizzled on a seasoned pan tastes better than one cooked on an unseasoned pan, so I was curious about how this burger would taste. And the answer is...pretty great. It's what I think of as an LA-style burger—a flat-pattied, thinnish, easily wrangled burger that you can eat with one hand. Personally, I prefer messy, fat burgers like you find at Donovan's Pub in Woodside, Queens, but I can appreciate both sorts. I ordered the Black Iron burger medium-rare. The patty was pink all the way through, with a well-seasoned outer crust. I do think that if the burger were cooked over medium-rare, the patty might dry out because it's thin. As it was, the burger spurted juice, and the bottom of the bun was moistened with its drippings. The bun itself is an unassuming sesame roll. I'd say this is a very respectable burger, and it's $7—not cheap for a burger, but not unreasonable either. I ordered the fried, pickled green tomatoes on the side. Very tart, very fried, nice. 540 East 5th Street 212-677-6067 Fried pickled green tomatoes

In a shocking turn of events, the Wall Street Journal conducts a presidential taste-test of wines from Arizona and Illinois, and Arizona wins. A spokesperson for McCain responded to the WSJ: "It appears that, just like the presidential campaign, the fruits of Arizona are of greater substance and texture and are preferred by those with discerning tastes." Oh, shut up. Do not want. [WSJ] Following in New York's footsteps, California will soon require that all restaurants with more than 20 branches post calorie counts. Gov. Schwarzenegger signed the bill today, and then he actually uttered the phrase: "I am really pumped up about this." [San Jose Mercury News] Meanwhile, Yum Brands, which owns Taco Bell, Pizza Hut and KFC, among others, says it will post calories on menu boards nationwide by 2011. [AP] Bravo has unveiled the 17 cheftestants for the new season of Top Chef, in New York. Of the 17, two are from New York. [E! Online] AQ Kafe (1800 Broadway), Corton (239 West Broadway) and Secession (30 Hudson Street) are all slated to open this week. [NYT]

In Defense of Apiary
AUTHOR:
Sarah DiGregorio
DATE:
2008-10-1 9:22:00
POST:
 I think I'm the only writer who has liked Apiary so far. My biggest complaint with the restaurant is that it's overpriced. And I can see why some people have found it dull. But here's why I liked it: The food is simple, not trendy, and really well executed. When you walk into a place that's so sleekly designed, the way Apiary is, you expect the food to be predictable: pork belly, sweetbreads, foie gras. But chef Neil Manacle isn't doing any of those popular dishes. Instead, he serves pork tenderloin, brined in smoked paprika, and mussels steamed in white wine so gently that they're still a little jiggly. This isn't food that's going to bowl you over no matter what (like pork belly, foie gras and bone marrow do). Apiary's food is quieter than the over-the-top food we've become used to. Also, the service is really smooth—friendly, but not overly so, helpful, but not invasive. Plus, the wine and beer program, with its emphasis on New York wines and craft beers, is one of the most thoughtful I've seen lately. So although I can understand why some people have found the food boring (and I do think it's too expensive), I'd argue that we need a few places around town that are doing simple food with care.

Our Man Sietsema Chases the Muff
AUTHOR:
Sarah DiGregorio
DATE:
2008-10-1 8:17:00
POST:
 This week, Our Man Sietsema is on a muffuletta quest. The sandwich is a New Orleans classic—a roll piled high with cold cuts and slicked with olive relish—invented at the Central Grocery in 1906. It's hard to find a good muffuletta outside NOLA, but that doesn't stop Our Man's intrepid quest. He stops by Delta Grill and Bourbon Street, but finds both muffulettas lacking. At Dive Bar, though, the sandwich is perfect: Unfortunately, the atmosphere at Dive Bar is not as lovely as the sandwich. Our Man is not known for being squeamish, or needing nice silverware to have a good time. So if he's a little put off by the surroundings, you know it's bad. Boschian?! Well, how bad do you want a good muffuletta?  The cold cuts represented a slight reordering of the usual roster, featuring mortadella, Genoa salami, and something dark that tasted like pastrami. Dive Bar's rendition ($10) was truly magnifíque, and a righteously oily olive salad provided ample lube. Noting the fire-red walls and Boschian landscape of twisted bodies in various stages of drunkenness, my date quipped: "This looks like Hell."

Incredibly Cheap Eats -- Yatagan
AUTHOR:
Robert Sietsema
DATE:
2008-11-25 13:31:00
POST:
 What carnivores among us can resist stopping and gawking when a giant mass of meat heaves into view? Turn the corner from Bleecker onto MacDougal and there it is, a giant meat cylinder the size of a basset hound, dripping, sizzling, and slowly rotating in the open window. The proprietors of Yatagan, a long-running Turkish café - it's like a Third-World food stall, really -- cannot be oblivious to the pornography of meat. The meat cylinder, composed of molded lamb and lamb fat, isn't called a gyro (that's Greek), and it isn't called a schwarma (that's Middle Eastern). Rather, it's known as a doner kebab, and forms the basis of many Anatolian plates of food. If you're by yourself, you'd better get a pita sandwich, which bulges with such a quantity of oozing lamb, that most patrons leave the sandwich wrapped in aluminum foil and eat it out of the top of the paper bag with a plastic fork. In addition to meat, the sandwich contains onions, lettuce, and good tomatoes, and your choice of sauces includes tahini, garlicky yogurt, and the hot relish sometimes called harissa, which you can apply for yourself from the vessel on the counter. If you're like me, one sandwich is too much to eat for one meal, so consider sharing it. 104 McDougal Street, 212-677-0952. The cost: $5.50

POST:
 When a friend asked recently where she could find huitlacoche, I replied, just about anywhere there's a Mexican grocery. Huitlacoche (Ustilago maydisis, sometimes spelled "chuitlacoche") is a fungus something like a puffball - smudgy white on the outside and black on the inside. The unlovely English name is corn smut. It snuggles up to the corn kernels inside the husk, and as many as a dozen specimens typically inhabit a single ear of corn. But far from being a botanical pest, huitlacoche is considered a great delicacy, sometimes called the Mexican truffle. It is occasionally available fresh in New York, but usually in upscale restaurants. Canned huitlacoche is excellent too, and always available. Just find a Mexican grocery.  I was up in the Bronx recently lecturing at Lehman College. Needless to say, I was surrounded by Mexican groceries. I stopped in at El Rancho Deli Grocery, figuring to find a taqueria in the back of the store, and there was. I ordered up a huitlacoche quesadilla ($6) and the cook threw a giant masa tortilla onto the griddle, covered it with cheese, onions, and iceberg lettuce, squirted on hot sauce, and then spooned on a luxurious quantity of huitlacoche. The black gooey mass was studded with corn kernels, and the chunks of fungus were mushroomy in texture and shape. The thing tasted great, and I was barely able to finish it. I nodded gracias to the cook, and a grabbed a can of huitlacoche to bring home to my friend. 19 East Kingsbridge Road, Bronx, 718-933-3138

NYC Wine Country: Drinking Manhattan Mead
AUTHOR:

POST:
Honey and alcohol: two of our favorite things I jumped the gun a bit when I wrote about New York City's urban winemakers last April. (Ever Had a Nice Bottle of Greenpoint?) For one thing, when I interviewed Michael Dorf about City Winery, it was slated to open this fall. But as you've probably seen from all the coverage of the winery's media event on Wednesday, it's now projected to open in January. (Maybe Dorf is hoping the stock market will be looking up after the new year. Because charging $5,000 to make a barrel of wine is perhaps not the most recession-proof business model.) More interestingly, I just got a follow up email from Nathaniel Martin, of Manhattan Meadery, letting me know that his first release just went on sale at the Chelsea Wine Vault. Manhattan Meadery's honey wine is local in the sense that it's made from New York State honey, but the only real Manhattan connection is that the mead-makers live here. Mead—made from fermented honey, not grapes—is one of the oldest alcoholic beverages in the world. The only problem is that it's often not that good. But I stopped by Chelsea Market to get a bottle of Brooklyn Buzz, Manhattan Meadery's first release ($13). And it turns out to be pretty tasty, although it took me a few sips to get accustomed to it. It smells a bit like honey and flowers, but with a sharp, alcohol undertone. It doesn't taste sweet, but has a nutty, bitter-edged honeyed flavor, almost like dry sherry. I was drinking it on its own, but it would probably be good with mild seafood or chicken. Brooklyn Buzz is worth trying at least once, especially because it's affordable, and you'll be supporting a small, local business.

Paneling

POST:
 A panel of experts convened at NYU's Fales Library late this afternoon to discuss "How Food and Food Writing Have Changed America." The moderator was restaurant consultant Clark Wolf, and the panel included (shown above from left to right) - Michael Batterberry (founder of Food and Wine magazine), David Kamp (author of The United States of Arugula), Ann Bramson (legendary cookbook editor), and Jonathan Gold (Pulitzer Prize winner and food critic of our sister publication, L.A. Weekly). Not shown, caterer and organic farmer Liz Neumark. Wolf began by dropping a bombshell: "I want to tell you that Gael Greene has just been fired at New York magazine." An audible groan emanated from the audience. In turn, each panel member expounded on his or her perspective on the topic. Batterberry recounted how he'd been encouraged by James Beard to found Food and Wine 30 years ago, at a time when chefs had gradually been turning from domestic servants into professionals. Kamp noted that, while movies and literature are now inferior to what they were 30 years ago, the food that we eat is much better. Bramson described some of her early cookbook projects, and noted how illustrations were once considered wimpy in cookbooks, but now the extensively illustrated cookbook is the norm. Neumark noted that she was catering the 100th anniversary party for the Plaza Hotel, emphasizing food made within 100 miles, and that 100 years ago, the food was also mainly from within 100 miles, except the caviar. Gold differentiated between ethnic restaurants in L.A. and those in New York, observing that the customer base of L.A. places tends to be people of the same ethnicity. In N.Y., ethnic restaurants are more likely to be frequented by a broad range of diners - and I think he meant foodies. He also said that ethnic restaurants tended to be much better than upscale trendy restaurants in L.A. Afterwards, a discussion ensued inspired by questions from the audience. A general disapproval of blogs was espoused, and one panel member predicted that blogs would soon be edited. Maybe just trying to be controversial, Kamp reviled chowhound.com and egullet.com, calling them "insular," but then praised Josh Ozersky and his new blog, http://www.the-feedbag.com/. Taking her turn, Neumark flamed the Food Network, pointing out that children watched it all the time ("I want to be like Rachel Ray," one girl had told her.), and that it never featured shows that taught nutrition. The afternoon ended with free wine, cheese, and pickles.

I seems to me that Mr. Kamp does not like change. To say that "literature are now inferior to what they were 30 years ago" seems a bit closed minded. There certainly are more movies than before. Does he watch them all? How is he judging? Special effects are certainly superior now. That's the problem with sweeping generalization like his. They not only are offensive, but are myopic. Blogs and user generate sites are a sign of the times. There is even a James Beard award for blogging now. Embrace change.

Incredibly Cheap Eats: Wah Ji Pork Chop

POST:
Taiwanese fried pork chop with rice and pickled vegetables: $4 There is a new Taiwanese pork chop house in town, and it is both delicious and cheap. Wah Ji Pork Chop Fast Food is closet-sized, spotless and busy but orderly; the hiss of fat pork chops hitting hot oil is constant. (To give credit where it's due, I first read about Wah Ji on Chowhound.) The feast pictured above is their basic plate, pork chop over rice ($4). Although you can get fried pork chops for a tiny bit less elsewhere in Chinatown, what sets Wah Ji apart is that their pork chop is not gobby with fat or as tough as jerky, but is meaty, tender and ringed with a judicious band of crispy fat. Plus, the heaping helping of white rice is fresh and hot, and the side of preserved vegetables is totally delicious. If you want to skip the vegetables and the rice, you can get a lone fried pork chop for only $1.95. As soon as you open the to-go container, you notice that the fragrance of cinnamon, cloves and star anise—the meat is marinated in five-spice powder before frying. I ended up picking it up and gnawing it down to the bone. (The fatty bits around the bone are always the best.) The generous mound of stew-like preserved vegetable—in this case, pickled cabbage and greens, mixed with ground pork—is vinegary, sweet and pungent. You can also get your fried pork chop in a black pepper marinade ($4), or you can get a fried chicken leg ($4) with your rice and veg instead of pork. There's also spicy fried popcorn chicken ($2) and scallion pancakes ($1.50). Wah Ji Pork Chop Fast Food 7 Allen Street 212-219-9876

Think I'll Have Another Glass of Mexican Wine

POST:
 I'm a big fan of the band Fountains of Wayne. So big a fan, in fact, that I've made the pilgrimage to Wayne, New Jersey to see the original Fountains of Wayne -- a store that displays a bizarre collection of lawn ornaments beside U.S. Highway 46. Of course, the band is nothing like the store, except in a certain flexible frame of reference, and in a similar tongue-in-cheek sense of humor. These characteristics help the band construct lyrics that are like elegant and humorous short stories, representing the moral parables of our age. Their most famous song is "Stacy's Mom" on Welcome Interstate Managers, in which an adolescent boy tries to convince his girlfriend that her mother is madly in love with him. His evidence is partly based on the way the mom says, "You missed a spot over there" as he mows the lawn. She's wrapped in a towel and showing some skin as she says this, which is not really that strange, since they're standing by a swimming pool. Hey, maybe mom really is hot for him. Fountains of Wayne. Photo courtesy Roadsideamerica.com The same spirit of glib ambiguity prevails in "Mexican Wine," the lead-off song on the same album. First off, it's a song about causality, probably inspired by a news item suggesting that defective batteries can cause your mobile phone to explode: He was killed by a cellular phone explosion They scattered his ashes across the ocean The water was used to make baby lotion The wheels of promotion, were set into motion... Eventually, this chain of causality leads to tragic consequences for the narrator, who turns out to be a pilot: I used to fly for United Airlines Then I got fired for reading High Times But floating in the midst of the verses is this ambiguous refrain: I tried to change, but I changed my mind Think I'll have another glass of Mexican wine. Why Mexican wine specifically? I set out to see if I could discover the reason, but first I had to find some actual Mexican wine. I'd been hearing for years that the wines of Baja, California were getting better and better, but when I scoured local liquor stores to find examples, I came up empty. Chalk it up to New York's liquor stores being so small, or maybe Baja wines are still too obscure. Eventually, I stumbled on a bottle at LaNell's in Red Hook, Brooklyn, a place that specializes in organic wines, female-made wines, and New York State bourbons. The wine was a Jubileo 2005, made in Guadalupe, Baja, Mexico, a desiccated valley with 20 wineries, 40 miles southeast of Tijuana. The wine is a Meritage, which means that it's a Bordeaux-style red made with a combination of grapes (usually including cabernet sauvignon and merlot, among others) permitted by California, U.S.A.'s Meritage Association. The winemaker is Laura Zamora, who qualifies as something of a Mexican winemaking superstar, and some of her vines - which require no irrigation, a big plus in Baja's arid climate - are 60 years old, making them Mexico's oldest. The flavor of the wine is rich, dark, and crisp, with saturated fruit flavors that jump down your throat. Though Jubileo knocks you out with its boldness, it lacks a certain balance and subtlety that one finds in the best Meritages. So what does the song mean? I'm assuming that drinking Mexican wine on the part of the bemused narrator is either a sign of his wine-swilling sophistication, or, more likely, his hang-dog willingness to accept everything that happens to him without protest -- including drinking wines that nobody's heard of. But if the song discourages you from trying Mexican wines, a sip of munchy, cheerful Jubileo should dispel that feeling. Gee, I think I'll have another glass of Mexican wine.

POST:
 For this week's dining newsletter, writer Hailey Eber talked to chef Pierre Landet from Cercle Rouge. He shared the recipe for this soup, which is full of good things that are in season at the Greenmarket right now. And for once, this is a chef recipe that's dead simple. You could serve it with the Thanksgiving meal, or just for dinner tonight. Apple Parsnip and Celery Soup Yield: About 10 servings Yes, duck fat makes everything better, but if you can't get your hands on it, use butter instead. Choose sweet apples like Gala or Golden Delicious. Calvados, or French apple brandy is called for, but you could use an American apple brandy. 2 tablespoons duck fat 1 Spanish onion, minced 4 apples, peeled and quartered 1 celery root, cubed 10 parsnips, peeled and chopped 2 quarts chicken stock 1 cinnamon stick 1/4 cup Calvados (apple brandy) 2 cups heavy cream salt to taste In a large pot over medium heat, warm the duck fat. Saute the onion in the duck fat until translucent and golden. Add the apples, celery root and parsnips. Stir. Mix in the chicken stock, cinnamon stick and Calvados, and bring to a simmer. Cook until the apples and vegetables are soft. Remove the cinnamon stick. Transfer the soup to a food processor or blender, and puree until very smooth. Stir in the heavy cream, and season with salt.

Late Season Tomato Confit
AUTHOR:
Robert Sietsema
DATE:
2008-11-19 12:14:00
POST:
 Sniff! Sniff! The sad last tomatoes, mainly from south Jersey, are rolling into the farmers markets around town. Woody, bruised, low on flavor, and often as pale as if they'd been suffering from the flu, they are nonetheless your last chance to eat local tomatoes until the scarlet fruit reappears next June. Well, here's a trick to both preserve them and improve the flavor. We're going to make delicious tomato confit. Cut each tomato into16 or so irregular pieces. With the tip of the knife, scrape out as many seeds with their surrounding jelly as you can, but don't be too careful. Lay the tomato fragments out on a greased cookie sheet, baking pan, or cast-iron skillet, making sure they are well spread out. This allows the liquid to evaporate without becoming a lake and effectively poaching your confit. Pour olive oil generously over the tops of the fragments, dust with salt (the fancier the salt, the better the flavor - I use coarse gros sel that a friend brought back from Brittany), and strew some finely chopped garlic over the top. Finally, if you want to cheat nature a bit, sprinkle on just a little bit of white sugar. Shove in an oven pre-heated to 250 degrees. Roast for two hours, or until the tomatoes shrink, darken, and start to brown slightly on the edges. When finished, the confit can be frozen, or kept in a sealed jar in the fridge for at least two weeks. Even better, eat it right away with some fresh ricotta on a toasted baguette. Or toss with spaghetti, olive oil, and parmesan cheese. You can also reconstitute the confit with water, broth, or white wine to make a bright-tasting sauce that will remind you of the flavor of ripe tomatoes at the height of their season.

 In this week's paper, I review Char No. 4, the temple to whiskey and homemade bacon on Smith Street in Brooklyn. Don't go unless you want to wear bacon perfume for the rest of the day—the whole place is filled with the aroma of pork belly being smoked. My dog thought I smelled great. Char No. 4 isn't a restaurant that's going to change your life, but it can be a very, very pleasurable place if you like pork and booze. (And Southern-style stewed greens, which are actually a pork sub-category.) The whiskey list is pricey, but features hundreds of choices, some of which are hard to find elsewhere. The menu makes prolific use of the homemade bacon, and of the fryer. Most of it is successful, including an unusual BLT, which features a slab of deep-fried bacon. Bring your Lipitor.

Our Man breaks it down for us: This restaurant tones down the pungency and amps up the Spanish influences (the Philippines were a Spanish colony) in order to appeal to more of the neighborhood. Quoth Our Man: A case in point is lechon kawali ($7.98), pork belly fried deep-brown and cut into juicy segments. It's a dead ringer for Dominican chicharron de cerdo, though Dominicans wouldn't recognize the sweet brown dipping sauce served on the side. ("It contains liver," cautioned the waitress, though she might better have warned us how sweet it was.) Another good example is the shrimp rebosado, an overflowing plate of battered and fried shrimp with a sweet chile sauce that could belong to a half-dozen cuisines. The entrée comes with smashed, double-fried green plantains, which the menu identifies by their Dominican name of tostones. But there are several more traditional Filipino dishes that Our Man particularly likes: the chicken adobo, for one, and the kare kare, a peanutty oxtail stew. You can tell Our Man is rooting for this restaurant, but he concludes that it isn't getting the volume of diners that it'll need to stay in business. So go check it out, quick!

Spam--Not Just for Hawaiians Anymore

POST:
Ladies and Gentlemen, here's your regular spam (right) and your "hickory smoked" (left) This Sunday's New York Times business section featured a story about the resurgence of Spam. Although Hormel wouldn't cooperate with the article, workers at the Spam factory in Austin, Minnesota told the reporter that they've been working crazy overtime since July. Spam is being cranked out non-stop, seven days a week, apparently because the economy is causing people to reconsider the canned, pink, ham-ish product. Spam sales are presumably up because it's cheap, but at Fairway, chicken thighs are $1.99 per pound, while Spam is $2.89 for 12 ounces. Still, Spam is very affordable, ready-to-eat and you don't have to add flavorings. Plus, you can't eat too much of it. Spam is very popular in Hawaii and the Philippines, where it was introduced by American servicemen during World War II. If all those people who like delicious adobo also like Spam, it can't be so bad, right? I'm no stranger to molded meat, both industrial (hot dogs) and fancy (rillettes, head cheese) but I have somehow gone my whole life without eating Spam. There's no reason that I should be squeamish about it, having happily eaten pretty much every part of the pig already. Even so, there's something creepy about the way Spam glistens. But it turns out to taste just like the inside of a hot dog. If we're all going to lose our jobs and hunker down in a bunker eating canned meat, you want at least one nice recipe for the bunker holiday party, right? So into DTK (DiGregorio Test Kitchens) I went, armed with two cans of Spam (one regular, one hickory smoked) and lots of oil. Here's what happened. And they taste pretty good. Actually, they're amazing. The future of entertaining Crispy Spiced Spam Skewers Yield: 6 skewers 1 (12-ounce) can Spam (hickory smoked or original) canola oil, for deep-frying 1/2 cup panko 1/2 cup rice flour 1 teaspoon salt 2 teaspoons chili powder (preferably Gebhardt brand) 1/4 teaspoon baking soda 2 eggs To serve: bottled barbecue sauce booze of your choice Slice the Spam length-wise into 6 playing-card-shaped pieces. Set aside. Into a large, heavy pot, pour the oil to a depth of about 4 inches. Place the oil over medium-high heat, and allow the oil to reach 350 degrees. (You can approximate this by dropping a pinch of flour into the oil. If it sizzles immediately, the oil is hot enough.) In a medium bowl, combine the panko, rice flour, salt, chili powder and baking soda. Mix well. In a separate bowl, beat the eggs. Take a piece of Spam, immerse it in the eggs, and then dredge it in the panko mixture, pressing the panko onto the surface of the Spam until well coated. Repeat with remaining slices. Working in two batches (to avoid crowding the pan), fry the slices of Spam in the oil until golden and crispy, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove, and place the Spam on paper towels to absorb excess oil. Stick a skewer in each piece, and serve with bottled barbecue sauce and lots of booze.

 Misspelling "Szechuan," perhaps for the purpose of suggesting the bad old Szechuan restaurants of the Upper West Side in the 1970s, Szechuan Gourmet gets the pin yin spelling right a mere inch below on the front page of its carryout menu, proclaiming "Authetic Sichuan Cusine." You wouldn't expect it, and certainly not on Smith Street. Though the degree of heat is somewhat restrained, much of the Sichuan dishes are marvelous. Shown above are the wontons Chengdu style, named after the Sichuan capital, and shown below is the tea-smoked duck, prettily showered with shredded scallions. The Sichuan stuff must be mined from among the normal Cantonese dishes typical of carryout Chinese establishments -- look in the "Chef's Specialties" and "Appetizers" to find it. 176 Smith Street, Brooklyn, 718-643-0377

I've always been very suspicious of this place, though I secretly hoped it would be an amazing surprise like Bay Ridge's Grand Sichuan House. Especially since I can walk to Szechuan Gourmet. Sounds like there might be some gems hidden on their menu, after all.

The Early Word: Momofuku Milk Bar

POST:
The problem with wearying of reading about every move David Chang makes is that, almost inevitably, his food is delicious. And it's delicious in ways that seem both simple and obvious (fish sauce, sugar, chiles, fried brussels sprouts, kimchi, butter, oysters, tempura eggs, pork belly), and at the same time singular and new. So while Chang's business moves occasionally seem irksomely haughty (charging $160 for lunch, without wine, in this economy), I can hardly ever find fault with his food. And that, not all the tiresome hype and the endless coverage on Eater, is what really matters. So we skipped the long lines this weekend, and waited until today to check out Momofuku Bakery and Milk Bar (207 Second Avenue). The very best thing I tasted was the already-famous salty pistachio caramel soft serve. And honestly, it's so good that I think I had to grab onto the table to steady myself. There's something almost witchy about the perfect ratio of salt to pistachio to caramel—and pistachio (under-used!) always has something wonderful and illusive about it. How do you describe that distinctive pistachio taste? It's nutty, fragrant and sweet, but not sugary. Rich and almost meaty. This pistachio soft serve fills your mouth with the flavor of pistachio, salt and caramel, and seems to go on forever. It's the color of yellowish split pea soup, and is the tiniest bit grainy, heavy with nuts. We didn't get any toppings, but there were brown butter solids available for scattering over the ice cream. Brown butter solids. I'll let that sink in for a minute. Everything else we tried was very good, but if I had to go for one thing, the soft serve would be it. Other highlights: Crack pie: Surprisingly, contains no actual narcotics, but instead is a thick and sticky concoction of butter, heavy cream and brown sugar. So it's only a little better for you than actual crack. Cookies! Top: Marshmallow-cornflake-chocolate chip. This one was actually a little bit too much, a little too chewy-crunchy, too much going on. Middle: Snickerdoodle. My favorite; cakey and pillowy, browned on the edges and fragrant of cinnamon and vanilla. Bottom: Corn cookie. Like the richest corn muffin top ever, a pleasantly grainy, sweet cornmeal cookie, crisp around the edges, soft and chewy inside. Pistachio Cake: Pistachio cake and icing, filled with layers of very tart lemon curd and a sprinkle of "milk crumbs," which seem to be sweetened milk, boiled down to solids. The volcano: The only savory thing we tried, this is a crusty bread bun (with those blistery little bubbles under the crust's surface that tells you it's going to be good) filled with potato gratin, bacon and gruyere. The whole thing smells overwhelmingly of bacon. This was my least favorite thing. It flirts with overkill.

The Early Word -- Salumeria Rosi

POST:
Cesare Cassela's new green balls, shown in their carryout container New York's own Tuscan cowboy chef, Cesare Cassela, is in the process of opening his new cafe and pork store known as Salumeria Rosi on the Upper West Side, mercifully near the IRT express station at 72nd Street. We couldn't help dropping by soon after it opened, just out of curiosity. The narrow space is half salumeria, half trattoria, and cured pork products -- including prosciuttos, mortadella, porchetta, lardo, and prosciutto cotto (an herby baked prosciutto, a Tuscan classic) are front and center in the glass case. The cafe part should be opening about now, but the carrying out of items in the glass case is already underway, with excited neighborhood denizens thronging the counter, and asking plenty of questions about the provenance of the meats. The cured pork products, while of obvious quality, are not unique in the city, but the other items the chef has concocted are of greater interest, to us at least. Shown above, the "greens" are beet greens fashioned into perfect orbs, and there's no more beautiful way to get you leafy vitamins. On their own, though, the greens are a little bland, so we poured over them the juice from the roasted peppers, which were so vinegary and garlicky they induced a pucker and then a burn. Brilliant! Pickled mackerel (a sustainable fish!) As you may know, Casella's parents have long owned a well-regarded trattoria a stone's throw from Lucca, Tuscany, and his sure hand with pickled fish and beans is evidence of this. The pickled mackerel, festooned with shaved fennel bulb and carrots, needed a bit more pickling, but the beans were totally on the money. There were six different beans represented in the salad, and we can't think of a better lunch. Outdoing my mom's three bean salad -- six bean salad! Salumeria Rosi, 283 Amsterdam Avenue, 212-877-4800

Recipe Improv: John Fraser Thanksgiving Special

POST:
Give this man some turkey skin Today, we're playing Recipe Improv with chef John Fraser of Dovetail (103 West 77th Street). Before opening Dovetail last December, Fraser worked stints at the French Laundry, at Taillevent in Paris, and Compass in New York. Since our great day of national gluttony is approaching, I threw some Thanksgiving-themed ingredients at Fraser. He responded with a recipe that would be perfect for using up the Thanksgiving leftovers without resorting to the dreaded never-ending turkey sandwiches. The surprise ingredients: Fried turkey skin (turkey chicharrones) Cranberries Marjoram The recipe: Day-After Thanksgiving Bread Salad Yield: 6 servings The bread used here can be pumpernickel, sourdough, or any other good bread, perhaps left over from your stuffing. 6 cups cubed bread 1 celery stalk, diced 2 carrots, peeled and diced 1 pound brussels sprouts, quartered 1/3 cup red wine vinegar 1 tablespoon honey 1 cup extra-virgin olive oil salt and pepper 1/2 cup cashews, toasted 3/4 cup chopped marjoram 1/4 cup chopped parsley 1 red onion, sliced and grilled or broiled 1 cup cranberry sauce 1/2 cup to 1 cup orange juice 1/2 cup crispy crumbled turkey skin (crisped in oil if necessary) fresh cranberries, for garnish Place an oven rack in the middle of the oven, and preheat to 300 degrees. On a sheet pan, spread out the bread. Toast bread in oven, stirring occasionally, until pale golden, 20 to 25 minutes. Set aside to cool completely. Meanwhile, bring a pot of salted water to a boil, and blanch the celery, carrot and brussels sprouts, until just tender. Remove vegetables from the pot, and briefly place them in a bowl of ice water to stop the cooking, and drain. Set aside. In a bowl, whisk together the red wine vinegar, honey and olive oil, and season to taste with salt and pepper. In a large bowl, combine the bread, vegetables, cashews, herbs and red onion. Toss in the vinaigrette, and season to taste with salt and pepper. In a blender, combine the cranberry sauce and 1/2 cup orange juice. Blend, adding more orange juice if necessary, until the mixture is the consistency of a spreadable puree. Spread the cranberry puree in a thin layer onto 6 serving plates. Top the puree with a serving of bread salad. Sprinkle turkey skin on top of each plate, and garnish with fresh cranberries.

POST:
Good morning, sunshine If you need an excuse to drink beer for breakfast, help is here. This new porter from Heartland Brewery combines ale with an earthy, dark Columbian coffee from Oren's Daily Roast to create a beer that has two of our favorite things: alcohol and caffeine. (Although the beer has 1/8th the caffeine of coffee, so you'll just have to drink more.) Oren's Daily Porter is rich and smooth, edged with bitterness, and really tastes predominately of good, strong coffee. It would be awesome as a beer float, with a scoop of mocha ice cream. For breakfast. You can get it at any Heartland Brewery location throughout the holiday season. Plus, one dollar from each pint goes towards International Rescue Committee's efforts to provide clean drinking water in Ethiopia.

Whither Chelsea Market?
AUTHOR:
Robert Sietsema
DATE:
2008-11-13 16:43:00
POST:
The Chelsea Market Ensconced in the old Nabisco factory at the corner of 15th Street and Ninth Avenue, Chelsea Market opened 11 years ago with the intention of being a top retail market for a vast range of groceries, while also providing warehouse and manufacturing space for food-related companies. The quirky gothic space was decorated with strange monumental sculptures, a waterfall, and - as the website describes it - "the detritus of a lost industrial culture." Within the first few years, Chelsea Market attracted a top-flight butcher, a good seafood store, a truly excellent vegetable market, a bulk fresh-juice stall, a florist, a baker, and an Italian import market that provided fresh black truffles in season. You could depend on Chelsea Market to vend all sorts of arcane groceries unavailable elsewhere in the city, and it became a one-stop locale for anyone preparing a dinner party. Still, those were tenuous days, and spaces within the market regularly went in and out of business, or remained yawningly empty. The upper floors gradually filled out, too, some with culinary concerns like the Food Network, but also with other sorts of companies, including dot.coms like Google, and TV networks like Oxygen and NY1. But somewhere along the road, the market lost its way. Maybe the first harbinger was Chelsea Thai Wholesale. Originally, it provided a wealth of Chinese and Southeast Asian groceries, with a little side specialty in carryout Thai food. Gradually, the shelves of groceries disappeared one by one, and tables appeared in the space and outside in the common thoroughfare. It was as if the café had eaten the grocery store, and now only a limited stock of actual groceries remains. In no particular order, the florist closed, the high-end butcher shut down (making Chelsea Market sadly meatless), the juice store moved out and into the vegetable market, and then disappeared completely. A combination restaurant, clothing store, and home furnishings depot moved into a prime location near the Ninth Avenue entrance, and an upscale baby clothier materialized at the opposite end of the market. The dairy store, run by the venerable Ronnybrook, recently removed most of its dairy cases - where the range of products had included difficult-to-find items like qark -- and replaced them with a lunch counter selling omelets and meat sandwiches. Most days, the lunch counter is empty, but there is often a line for ice cream cones. How about a sugary cupcake? A mediocre Jewish deli opened with no apparent market appeal, save for a retail pickle operation. New tables for eating were strewn around many of the previously empty spaces in the market's common areas, inviting one to sit rather than browse, and sightseers replaced purchasers as the primary foot traffic. The fish market recently added more space, emphasizing its pre-fab sushi and soup offerings. A franchise eatery, Hale and Hearty Soups, moved in and then expanded. No one seems to have noticed, but the Chelsea Market has increasingly become the Chelsea Food Court. It's been transformed from a place for serious cooks, to a place for casual tourists who'd rather eat cake than make it, and office workers in search of a quick lunch. In doing so, the place has lost its original imperative, and became a place for the passive appreciation of prepared food (and unrelated consumer goods), rather than a place where one actively buys and then cooks. The evolving mix of businesses, as well as the tourist hordes who march through, munching on frosted cupcakes - reflects the sad change in attitude. Sit down and have lunch

This person obviously had a bad experience at the Market. I am new to the Market and I find it a very interesting place to be. Everyday I walk through, I find something new (and unusually odd). And, the way the staff and shop keepers decorate for the holidays is great. Did you recently check out Halloween! I put on my costume and had a ball! I noticed pumpkins that look like turkeys today. I understand the lights at Christmas are a site. There is always something happening at the Market. Don't knock the Shops!

Blame it on the Food Network,with it's trundling hordes of tourists,and the fact that they won't be carrying home a steak,or some guanciale.That ,and the fact that fewer New Yorkers actually cook at home with real ingredients...Plus,the original pioneer tenants at the market were given good long term leases.That's probably changed in recent years.

You said it Bob. I miss the old days too, when it seemed more like a ritzy take on the Essex or La Marqueta. You would think that as New Yorkers become more and more interested in cooking at home it would have become more focused on retail. Oh well. Maybe all the spaces can become banks like every other storefront in Manhattan and then I will have even more of a reason to avoid it.

As the President of The Lobster Place, Inc. and one of the founding tenants at Chelsea Market, I take great exception to this article. The market has indeed changed a great deal in the 13 years since its opening, but so has this community, this city, and the food consumer. The market hasn't whithered...it's evolved, and there are new and exciting tenants that will be joining us soon. First, I hasten to point out that Amy's Bread, Manhattan Fruit, Sarabeth's Bakery, Chelsea Market Baskets, Chelsea Wine Vault, Buon Italia, Cleaver Handmade Foods, Bowery Kitchen Supply, and of course The Lobster Place have been in the market over 10 years and continue bring the same great products to the New York consumer that they always have. Many of these businesses have indeed expanded their product lines and ventured into new offerings, but the core of the market remains very much intact. Here at The Lobster Place we completed a massive expansion of our store this October making it the largest retail fish market in the country. We stock 40 varieties of fin fish, 8 different types of oysters, 6 types of shrimp, and countless smoked and specialty products every day. In addition, our lobster tank facility holds up to 3,000 lbs of live lobster and our sushi chefs and take out kitchen provide a vast assortment of ready to eat meals that are quite popular. Manhattan Fruit continues to run its wholesale operations from the market and remains the best destination for everything from arugula to fresh ginger. Amy's Bread still is baking her artisinal delights for the restaurant industry and offering them to the layman in her store. Ditto for Sarabeth - and Chelsea Wine vault still has a great selection of wines and spirits and a new tasting room to boot. As for the "franchise" Hale and Hearty...the company was essentially founded here and up until recently had their entire factory operation in Chelsea Market for all of their stores. Ronnybrook dairy has built a lunch counter, but their refrigerated cases still offer the same array of great milk, yogurt, and ice cream. Finally, Chelsea Market Baskets is still one of the great purveyors of fine gifts and foods from Europe and beyond...and they've also added a line of cheeses. Yes, Frank the butcher is gone...but that space was always more restaurant than meat market - with just two refrigerated cases in a small alcove off their dining room. Also, we were sorry to see the flower market go - but it hardly meant that Chelsea Market was disappearing. It is most definitely true that much of the wholesale distribution business that used to run from Chelsea Market has gone. We re-located our wholesale division to Hunts Point in the Bronx earlier this summer. But if you've visited Chelsea lately, i think you'd agree that it's a difficult neighborhood to bring a fleet of 10 delivery trucks in and out of 6 days a week. Bottom line, Chelsea Market is evolving and will continue to do so. Rumors abound of a great butcher who will be joining the ranks as well as some other exciting new neighbors. But this is no tourist trap...Stop by anytime and I'll show you myself.

Taste Test -- Burger Creations
AUTHOR:

POST:
 Forget the rather frou-frou name -- Burger Creations throws down its albeit tiny gauntlet to the esteemed burger chain Five Guys, which has been steamrollering around town lately, setting up branches in every available space. Burger Creations creates a similar size burger, then dumps it on a luxe brioche bun with the usual virtuous roughage and mayo-based sauce. Both burger establishments use freshly ground beef ("Never frozen" they both chortle). The difference lies in the fact that, at Burger Creations, you can order your patty done the way you want it, and fear of salmonella be damned. Five Guys, in their correct corporate manner, cooks your beef to a cinder, and one depends upon the accoutrements to provide much-needed moisture. Not everything at Burger Creations is worth scarfing -- the fries are not as good as Five Guys, and the vegetarian burger is like gooey undercooked falafel -- but I'm still dreaming of the burger. In fact, I'm going to jump on my bike and get one right now. 52 East 8th Street, 212-539-1909

On a Stick! The Early Word on Daruma
AUTHOR:

DATE:

POST:
Daruma is a new yakitori/sushi bar in Nolita with a long, narrow blond wood bar, a few tables and, on the wall, giant images of multi-culti yakitori-eaters wielding meat on a stick and baring their teeth. There are $5 sushi rolls, but the yakitori is the point here. Each skewer is $2. From a perch at the bar, you can watch your choice of foodstuff get jammed on a stick, grilled or fried, and then zapped to crispiness with a torch. There's nothing funky going on—no chicken sternum or ovaries—but there are sixteen different options, ranging from Japanese sausage to fried fish ball to bacon/scallop to chicken wing. The yakitori are tiny (especially the bacon/scallop, which is more like small scraps of scallop wrapped in bacon), so the two dollar price tag isn't quite the fantastic deal I thought it was, but it's still very fair. I'd go with two or three people and order one of each yakitori, plus beer. Heads up if you live or work nearby: Daruma delivers. The on-a-stick-highlights: Left to right: Rice stick (a corn-dog-shaped oblong of rice, nicely crispy on the outside, like the bits at the bottom of a bi bim bap bowl); gyu tender beef; shrimp Left to right: Meager scallops wrapped in bacon; bouncy, mild squid balls; seafood shu mai with spicy mayo Daruma 227 Mott Street 212-219-9288

A Fall Recipe from James, Brooklynite of the Moment
AUTHOR:
Sarah DiGregorio
DATE:
2008-11-12 11:51:00
POST:
 Everyone loves James, the newish "seasonal-American restaurant with Old-World European influences" in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn. Even Our Man Sietsema adores it, and we know he isn't easy to impress. For this week's dining newsletter, writer Hailey Eber talked to James' chef, Bryan Calvert. Hailey snagged this hearty fall recipe from Calvert—we know it isn't exactly a quick weeknight dinner, but it would be an appealing vegetarian entree for Thanksgiving, no? Ravioli with Bucheron and Pine Nuts with Squash and Sage Puree Yield: Four servings For the pasta dough: 1/2 pound all-purpose flour 1/2 pound semolina flour 4 egg yolks 1 teaspoon salt For the filling: 1/2 cup Bucheron goat cheese 1 1/4 cup ricotta 1/8 cup toasted pine nuts salt and pepper For the egg wash: 1 egg For the sauce: 2 tablespoons butter 2 cups diced butternut squash 1 carrot, peeled and diced 1/2 stick celery, diced 1 clove of garlic 1/4 cup white wine 1 sage sprig 1 cup heavy cream salt and pepper To garnish: sage chiffonade toasted pine nuts Prepare the dough: In a food processor, pulse together the two flours. Add the egg yolks, and pulse until pasta dough just comes together. Form into a ball, cover loosely with plastic wrap, and allow dough to rest for one hour. While the dough is resting, prepare the filling: In a food processor, combine all ingredients and pulse until uniform. Taste for salt and pepper, and adjust seasoning if necessary. Set aside. Make the egg wash: Beat egg with 1 tablespoon water. Set aside. Assemble the ravioli: Using a pasta machine, roll the dough into thin sheets. Place 1 sheet of pasta on a clean surface. Scoop out 2-tablespoon portions of the filling onto the pasta, spacing the dollops of filling a few inches apart. Brush egg wash onto the exposed parts of the pasta sheet. Place another pasta sheet on top of the first and press down around the filling. Cut out ravioli with a round cookie cutter. Repeat with remaining pasta sheets and filling. Cover ravioli loosely with plastic wrap and set aside. Make the sauce: In a saute pan over medium-low heat, melt the butter. Add the squash, carrot, celery and garlic, and sweat (cook gently) for 5 minutes. Add the white wine, and bring to a simmer. Simmer until pan is almost completely dry. Add enough water to cover the vegetables. Add the sage. Simmer gently, uncovered, until vegetables are completely soft. Add the cream, and remove the sage sprig. Remove mixture to a blender, and puree until very smooth. Season sauce with salt and pepper, and keep warm To serve, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Drop in the ravioli and cook for about 4 minutes. Drain. Place raviolis in serving bowls, and top with warm sauce. Garnish with sage chiffonade and a sprinkle of toasted pine nuts.

This fellow is holding a kind of sweet, not a chaat, but he is at Sukhadia's, one of the best places to get chaat in Manhattan This week, I went in search of the best chaat (spicy-crunchy-sour-sweet Indian snacks and street food) available in Manhattan. Read the story for some thoughts on chaat from Tabla chef Floyd Cardoz, whose new street food cart, with its tasty but mild version of bhel puri, had me thinking about chaat all summer. I checked out all the new-ish restaurants and scruffy hole-in-the-walls where you can get some version of fried papri, chutneys, chaat masala and other goodies, all tossed together into a terrifyingly addictive snack. It turns out that midtown is fast becoming a chaat corridor. It's not all as good as the chaat you get in Mumbai, but chaat is kind of like pizza—when it's great it's amazing, and when it's not, it's still good.

Our Man Sietsema Digs Brooklyn Thai

POST:
 You only need to search for "Thai" on the Outer Boroughs Chowhound board to realize that Queens is the one to beat. But recently, Our Man Sietsema's been eating Siamese in the borough of kings. He reviewed Am-Thai Chili Basil Kitchen in Kensington a few weeks ago, and today, he's at MaiThai, in Sunset Park. All this good eating prompts Our Man to ask: Is Brooklyn Thai—once a collection of lackluster, sugar-happy, fish-sauce-challenged joints—beginning to be a threat to the hegemony of Queens Thais? Aaaaand...no. At least not in our lifetimes. Still, the growth of good Thai in Brooklyn is worth noting. And at MaiThai, Our Man finds plenty that he likes, along with a few missteps. The papaya salad is particularly dope, adding peanuts and miniature dried shrimp to the firm tendrils of green fruit for a triple crunch. In order of excellence, we also enjoyed the duck salad and the barbecued pork salad ($6.50), the latter with a wonderfully rich soy dressing. (The succulent pork contained therein is also available as an appetizer, $7). He also recommends the whole fish dishes, as well as a shrimp dish with stink bean. MaiThai is on the Chinatown stretch of 8th Avenue, and is a fun and lively neighborhood to wander before or after dinner. 4618 Eighth Avenue, Sunset Park Brooklyn, 718-438-3413

Condiment Love: Kecap Manis
AUTHOR:

POST:
Yes, please I'm generally obsessed with condiments. While I was in Bali recently, I discovered kecap manis (first word sounds like "ketchup"), the thick and syrupy Indonesian soy sauce. Basically, it's soy sauce reduced with palm sugar— the consistency of honey and the color of molasses. It's a bit salty and darkly sweet. I especially like it mixed with chile sambal, so that you get sweet, spicy, salty and garlicky all at the same time. Use it as a dipping sauce, add it to stir fries, or drizzle it over fried rice or noodles as a finisher. There's also a common breakfast dish of bland rice porridge, garnished with bits of fried tempeh, fried shallots, sliced chiles and scallion, with kecap manis stirred in at the end. At home you could easily do the same thing with cream of wheat. To use it: Here's a good recipe for nasi goreng (fried rice) with kecap manis. To buy it: Kalustyan's 123 Lexington Avenue 212-685-3451

Incredibly Cheap Eats -- Mambi
AUTHOR:

POST:
 Caldo Gallego is Dominican soul food. "Gallego" refers to the language and population of Galicia, a region in northwestern Spain composed of sea cliffs and green hills that is unlike most people's impressions of the hot and dusty Spanish landscape. Many Dominicans trace their origins to Galicia, and the namesake soup often served in Washington Heights cafes embodies romantic associations with the old country. Similar to the Portuguese soup called caldo verde, caldo gallego contains small white beans, kale, smoked pig tidbits, and vegetables that partially disintegrate to make a thick and garlicky potage - a perfect one-dish meal. In the wonderful version at Mambi, which is just down Broadway from the bus depot, we picked out savory tidbits of pig tail, trotter, skin, and shank, along with carrots and potatoes that a friend described as "so creamy they taste like they've been cooked for a week." A squeeze of lime makes the flavor take off. Along with the bowl of soup, you get a basket brimming with bread slices that have been slicked with fat and toasted in the same press used to make Cuban sandwiches. The soup is silky and unforgettable. 4181 Broadway, Manhattan, 212-928-9796. The cost: $4

 Ad Age reports that Starbucks fourth quarter sales are down by a whopping 97 percent. Meanwhile McDonald's, like a cockroach in nuclear winter, manages to eek out a 8.2 percent gain. Boo. Not only that, but Blimpie's also seems to be doing poorly in the city. While Blimpie's are not exactly great places to eat, the company does give its franchise owners free reign to create delicious things like this, which makes us root for the dirty little underdog sandwich shops. Midtown Lunch reports that the Blimpie's that makes the so-bad-it's-good vegetarian special sandwich will soon go the way of the dinosaurs--and tells us that another Blimpie's closed last month.

Bon Chon Chicken, now available in the East Village, hooray Boka joined the St. Mark's Place yakitori and noodle row about a month and a half ago. It's owned by a Korean family (so says the very hurried woman who answers the phone and then hangs up on all other questions), but calls itself fusion Korean. The fusion seems to be taken care of by Japanese-style sushi, and a bi bim bop featuring mozzarella cheese. Boka peddles in hearty standards like bi bim bop (hot or cold, various toppings available), rice cake, bulgogi and Korean rice balls. They also serve Bon Chon Chicken—the crackly, crispy, spicy Korean fried chicken that has a branch in Koreatown—which makes me an instant fan. We stopped by for lunch, and had a spicy pork bi bam bap ($14)—very tasty in a standard sort of way.  And we also had a small plate of the Bon Chon chicken ($7), which is like crack, only much, much better. Boka 9 Saint Mark's Place 212-228-2887

My boyfriend and I went here because I lived in Korea for 5 years and my boyfriend is Korean. We didn't like the food or the service. Reasons: (1) At 7 p.m. they were out of drumsticks, their signature dish. (2) The miso soup was served cold. (3) The appetizers came at the same time as the main dishes. (4) We asked for soy sauce but never got it. (5) The "hot stone" bibimpop dishes were tasteless, at least by Korean standards. (6) Drinks took forever to arrive. And so on.... We won't go back.

I, Locavore -- Part One
AUTHOR:
Robert Sietsema
DATE:
2008-11-10 13:23:00
POST:
 A locavore, of course, is a person who's greatest priority, food-wise, is to purchase wholesome products made as close to home as possible. Partly, this a intended to reduce one's carbon footprint, but it's also out of repulsion at the practice of growing food on one side of the globe and then sending it to the other, replacing fields in Third World countries that once grew staples for local consumption with luxury agricultural products for foreigners. Anyway, food is healthier when eaten soon after it's plucked from the ground, as the reasoning goes, and a berry shipped from Chile and consumed in New York during wintertime is selfish, exploitative, and expensive - even if it's labeled "organic." But to qualify as a locavore, does it mean you have to purchase your groceries in the local farmers market and pay $10 apiece for pork chops and $4 for every pound of potatoes? I set out to see what local products are still available in regular supermarkets, ignoring such other considerations as organic status and humane production methods. So, visiting every supermarket and bodega I could find, I went locavoric, enjoying cash savings in the process. The first local foodstuffs I stumbled on came from dairies, but I'll look at other products in further columns. Despite the incursion of national dairies like Tuscan and Horizon, and milk irradiated to lengthen its shelf life, there are still dairies in The Catskills, Eastern Pennsylvania, and New England that do it the old fashioned way, milking local cows and making undoctored dairy products. One has to look no further than Cabot Creamery in Cabot, Vermont (265 miles away), to find a line of milk, butter, and cheeses that are produced relatively close to my home in New York City. But could I do better? Looking for small creameries that produce dairy products from local cows, I found Beaver Meadow Creamery in Du Bois, Pennsylvania (230 miles away). Their AA butter is sweet and salty, and exhibits an old fashioned taste that delights me. Even better, the price was only $3.25 per pound, much better than the $5 I was used to paying for Land-O-Lakes or Breakstone. At another grocer, I found eggs from McMahon's Farm in Hopewell Junction, New York (60 miles away!!). The yolks set up high and bright yellow when I fried them. I also discovered milk from Welsh Farms in Wallington, New Jersey, a dairy founded in 1891 that pledges their dairy farmers use no bovine growth hormone. And the dairy is a scant nine miles from Manhattan. Finally, we have New York state cheddar. This product is readily available in groceries and specialty cheese stores, and I can buy it in preference to Wisconsin cheddar, English cheddar, Canadian cheddar, or even Australian cheddar. And, at $3.99 per pound, New York cheddar is cheaper than the other varieties. That doesn't mean I'm going to start grating it on my pasta, though. Next: Rediscovering Long Island potatoes

Incredibly Cheap Eats: Ba Xuyen (But Not Banh Mi) 
AUTHOR:
Sarah DiGregorio
DATE:

POST:
We're phasing out the Cheap Lunch! series in favor of the more inclusive Incredibly Cheap Eats series—because we like to find cheap eats at all times of day, yes? Ba Xuyen, in Brooklyn's Sunset Park, makes my favorite banh mi. Although those delicious, overstuffed sandwiches certainly qualify as cheap eats (they're $3.50), Ba Xuyen hawks other affordable goodies that are easy to overlook while in such close proximity those outrageous banh mi. But today I resolved I would not give in to the siren call of the banh mi, but would poke around in the display case warmers for some alternative Ba Xuyen cheap eats.  Banh beo ($2.50 for a large plate) are silver-dollar-sized, jiggly, steamed rice cakes, that can be topped with savory or sweet garnishes. Ba Xuyen splits the difference between sweet and savory, to good effect (although Vietnamese food expert Andrea Nguyen told me sweet-savory was unorthodox, it still tastes great). The cakes are crowned with a bit of coconut cream, a small dollop of slightly sweet mashed mung bean, fried shallots, dried shrimp and ground peanuts. Douse them in fish sauce and carefully convey the goopy, wonderful little bites to your mouth.  It's easy to love summer rolls, and Ba Xuyen's rolls ($3.50 for a plate of 3, plus sauce) are impeccably fresh—the rice paper wrap is pleasantly chewy and moist. The translucent paper is stuffed with shrimp, copious greenery, mint and basil, and rice noodles. They're a serious bargain because they're almost burrito-sized—they're the most gigantic summer rolls I've ever seen; one plate is actually a large meal. Ba Xuyen 4222 8th Avenue 718-633-6601

Test-Driving Murray's Real Salami

POST:
Sometimes, in the name of science and journalism, I am forced to consume large quantities of charcuterie for lunch. Today, I stopped by Murray's Cheese Shop's new venture, Murray's Real Salami, to see what was what. The shop has an impressive range of porky products, especially considering that it's just a small stand within the Grand Central Marketplace. Each hunk of fatty goodness sports a little sign describing in detail what that product is and where it's from (the same way Murray's cheeses do). That's a good thing, because although the shop hawks all the usual favorites that everyone knows (soprassata, proscuitto, serrano ham, etc) there are also less common goods like surryano ham—hickory smoked, aged one year—from S. Wallace Edwards and Sons in Virginia. Murray's sources their charcuterie from places like Chelsea's wonderful Salumeria Biellese, among others. Highlights: Venison-apricot-hazelnut pate ($19.99/pound from Fabriques Delices). A coarse, gamey, meaty grind. Coppa ($19.99 from Salumeria Biellese). Assertively porky, a litttle rough, ribboned liberally with fat. Would be good on a sandwich. Surryano Ham ($22.99 pound from S. Wallace Edwards). This is like a pink, silky hickory smoke bomb. Very salty! Murray's Real Salami Grand Central Marketplace 43rd Street and Lexington 212-867-7202

 Amid the deluge of recession specials, we just got word of one that takes the trend to another level: Casa Havana is offering a Recession Breakfast that includes two eggs, ham or bacon, french fries, toast and coffee for 20 cents. That's an entire meal you could pay for by digging up change from under the couch cushions. We can't say how delicious it is (although we do like their octopus salad), but for 20 cents we're not asking the hard questions.

Cheap Jerk in Flatbush
AUTHOR:
Sarah DiGregorio
DATE:
2008-11-6 10:46:00
POST:
As part of our ongoing obsession with delicious, incredibly cheap eats, Our Man Sietsema has been spending time with jerk. Mini jerk The meals at Blake Bakery and Take Out in Flatbush - perched atop the Beverly Road stop on the 2 train -- come in three sizes: mini ($5), medium ($7), and large ($9). Pictured above is the mini, which contains enough food to feed you and a small pet. While the jerk chicken was not smoked, it makes up for it by being thickly crusted with fresh herbs and ground allspice -- the miniature dried fruit of a tree native to Jamaica, but now popular all over the world as a baking spice. The coating also demonstrates a good quantity of scotch bonnet heat, enough to make you break a sweat as you eat the chicken. The jerk comes with steamed veggies and a huge compressed heap of rice and peas. Here as in most Jamaican cooking, "peas" refers to kidney-shaped pink beans. The brown-tinted dirty rice that mixes with the peas is already muy-flavorful, but as she spoons it into the Stryofoam container, the white-uniformed attendant, who looks like an angel from heaven, will ask you, "Do you want oxtail gravy on that rice?" The correct answer on your part is an enthusiastic, "Yes!" 1681 Nostrand Avenue, Brooklyn, 718-693-5133

Fork in the Road at Double Crown
AUTHOR:
Sarah DiGregorio
DATE:
2008-11-5 11:15:00
POST:
 This week, I review Double Crown. I don't understand restaurants like Double Crown where the food is beside the point, and supposedly everyone knows it. Or rather, I get it, but I think it's snobbish and clubby. Because maybe you and I and everyone who reads the food media in New York already knows that Double Crown isn't about the food, it's about the (admittedly beautiful) design. But not every diner reads New York restaurant news (gasp!) and someone who is a little bit interested in trying a new restaurant for a special occasion might drop a whole lot of money on Double Crown's mediocre food, just because he or she is not in on the joke. And while most of the food is mediocre or just fine, some dishes are cynically bad—like the fluke with daal, which I seriously could not choke down. Anyway, I'm feeling much less cranky this Obama morning, but I stand by the way I felt about Double Crown. There's cleverness to spare here, and the entire menu sounds like it's going to taste really, really good. So then when the food turns out to be an obvious afterthought, it just seems lazy. It's got an actual chef, and you part with real money for a plate of food: it's meant to be a restaurant, not a nudge-nudge-wink-wink "restaurant." Meanwhile, yes, the space is amazing, and just as impressive as you've heard. Go for a drink.

POST:
He likes it This week, Our Man Sietsema is eating at No.7, the Fort Greene underdog that has charmed pretty much every critic that's walked through its doors. But Our Man isn't easily wooed by simple cleverness, so when he says he likes a place, you know that there is serious cooking going on. There's whimsy and fun going on in chef Tyler Kord's cooking, but it's the good technique that gets Our Man going: Other good things include piggy head bits in broth, an egg that's been boiled, crumbled and deep-fried and still manages to have a runny yolk and a dessert that surprises Our Man with miso. On three visits, our favorite entrée proved to be the so-called roast chicken—really a scrumptious roulade with crisp skin on the outside, resting in a truffle jus that owed nothing to the synthetic truffle oil used in so many restaurants. The roulade represented classic French cooking in an unexpected corner of Fort Greene.

 Well kids, here we are at last. I'd like to say something hope-y, but I don't want to jinx it, so let's just talk about where to eat and drink while watching election returns, shall we? NY Mag has a good guide here. In the spirit of fairness they even include the Young Republicans gathering. Crash it. Metromix has a comprehensive list, with a Queens rundown that includes Bohemian Beer Garden's free stand-up comedy. Time Out sums up the big parties, and also lets us know that Little D, in Brooklyn, is having a luau in honor of Obama's birthplace. Eater compiles still more venues with drink specials et al, (including the option to "raise joyful voices" at Brooklyn's Flatbush Farms) and includes a map. Also! At Babeland, voters can get a free vibrator or "Maverick sleeve." Whatever that is. When the good news (hopefully) finally rolls in late tonight, grab your maverick sleeve and your bottle of Champagne and take to the streets.

Babi Guling--Balinese Pork DIY

POST:
Ibu Oka's famous sucking pig: big hunks of spice-napped pork,a nugget of blood sausage, long beans with coconut (notice the large shard of skin on the side) I just got back from a trip to Bali, Indonesia, where I ate a lot, naturally. One of the best meals I had was at a food stand in Ubud Village run by a woman named Ibu Oka. Ibu Oka specializes in roast pig and accompaniments like a simple vegetable, homemade blood sausage and fried innards. Her open-air restaurant was one of the only eateries where I saw equal parts tourists and locals digging in. (In case you're wondering, Bali is over 90 percent Hindu, which makes roast pig, well, kosher, even though it's part of Muslim Indonesia.) The small pig is gutted, spread on the inside with a powerfully pungent paste made from shallots, garlic, galangal, lemon grass and dried shrimp paste among other things. It's then tied up and roasted over a coconut husk fire until the meat is buttery and the skin is like golden stained glass. Ibu Oka only roasts four to five pigs a day, so when she sells out you're out of luck. While we were digging into our own plates, a freshly roasted whole pig arrived—thunk—on the massive cutting board. I watched one of the workers grab the skin and peel the entire thing back with a crack, leaving her holding a poster-sized sheet of golden crackling, which was then hacked up, along with the flesh, for the waiting orders. Since I don't have a little pig just waiting to be rubbed all over with garlic and lemon grass in my backyard (and if I did, I wouldn't have the coconut husks to grill him over anyway), here's a good approximation to make Babi Guling at home. There are a lot of ingredients for the spice rub, but other than that it's dead easy. Babi Guling Brooklyn Yield: About 10 servings Although it's fine to sub macademia nuts for candlenuts, if you substitute ground turmeric for fresh or ground galangal for fresh, the vibrancy of the dish will suffer. Kalustyan's has fresh turmeric, kaffir lime leaves and galangal root. Usually they keep these items frozen, which is fine, just defrost and use. 1 skin-on pork shoulder, boned (about 5-8 pounds) 1 1/2 tablespoon salt 10 shallots, peeled and sliced 6 cloves garlic, peeled and chopped 1 (1-inch) piece ginger, peeled and chopped 15 candlenuts, chopped (or substitute macadamia nuts) 1 (4 inch) fresh turmeric, peeled and chopped 2 tablespoons coriander seeds, crushed 1 (2-inch) piece galangal root finely chopped 25 bird's eye chilies, or to taste 10 stalks lemon grass, sliced 1 tablespoon black peppercorns, crushed 1 teaspoon dried shrimp paste, toasted briefly in a dry skillet 5 kaffir lime leaves, finely shredded 2 1/2 tablespoons oil 2 tablespoons turmeric Preheat oven to 300 degrees. Season the pork generously inside and out with salt. In a large bowl, mix and pound together all remaining ingredients except turmeric. Using a sharp knife, make long incisions in the pork skin, and stuff the spice mixture underneath skin. Rub the rest of the mixture into the flesh. Make a turmeric wash, by combining the turmeric with 2 tablespoons water. Brush the turmeric water all over the pig, and especially over the skin. Cook the pork shoulder in the oven 3 to 4 hours, or until tender. Increase oven temperature to 450 degrees and roast at high heat for 15 minutes to crisp the skin. Rest for 10 minutes before serving, and dish out a portion of meat and skin to each plate. Serve with steamed white rice. . The whole shebang

Hello Sarah Just discovered FITR, and reading backward has brought me to your Babi Guling post. Bali, especially Ubud, is my second favourite place after Maui, where I've lived for quite a while. Your recipe has me salivating. Turmeric and galangal? No problem, they're available fresh in the local markets. Kaffir lime? No problem, a German with a goat dairy has plenty of bushes. But *please* call it makrud, kaffir lime is a pejorative. I like to use the limes rather than the leaves, grating the zest for cooking. Shrimp paste, which sort? Stinky blachan, which needs careful handling, or something else?

What's for Dinner?

POST:
What's For Dinner? In which we ask random New Yorkers about their food lives.  Name: Mike Duffy Occupation: Events planner Location: Union Square, sitting on a bench, enjoying the sunny fall day Lives: In Pennsylvania, although he lived in New York for 20 years Mike didn't want me to take a picture of him, saying that he'd like to "remain anonymous." He is a trim man in his late forties, with close-cropped salt and pepper hair. What's your earliest food memory? A birthday cake, probably. A classic birthday cake. What's your most cherished food memory? My time in Rome, I lived there for a while. It was just one great meal after another. It's wonderful to spend time with friends, eating and drinking wonderful food. There's a restaurant by the Piazza dei Fiori. I can't remember the name. I loved everything there: pasta, everything. The main would probably be veal saltimbocca; it's wonderful. What do you think the main differences are between the way people in Rome eat and the way New Yorkers eat? The ingredients. And here we just imitate a lot. And everything is way overpriced. It's not that some Italian restaurants aren't expensive; they are. But a good restaurant here is very overpriced. I like home style food, pasta with sausage or meatballs. It doesn't have to be gourmet. Any places you enjoy in New York? Lattanzi, on the westside. Everything there is wonderful. And for a more affordable night with friends, I like Sambuca, on the Upper West Side. It's a nice family place with good, decent food. What's for dinner tonight? I'm thinking about going to the Zen Palate, I've never been.

The Early Word -- Company, or is it Co.?

POST:
King among bread bakers, Jim Lahey was a co-founder of Sullivan Street Bakery, but, apparently,?he always longed to make pizza. You can get an excellent slice of pizza at the bakery,?but it comes in big rectangular sheets (potato, mushroom, or the fabled pizza bianca), and is served at room temperature.  What he wanted to make was Naples style pizza, but his new place--called Co. or Company, depending on where you see the name--was delayed again and again, as chronicled by Eater.com. Now the place is opening softly, mainly to family and friends, and I got a chance to taste the pies thanks to Lillian Chou, a friend and food editor at Gourmet who will soon be exiling herself to Beijing for who knows how long. She's been recipe-testing on Lahey's bread cookbook, expected any time now. Currently, the place looks like a suburban garage inside, and the waiters are still rehearsing their pizza pitches. The pies are individual-sized, and priced from $7 to $21, which seems a little steep. The pie list includes 9 selections, and some of them are, shall we say, quirky in the extreme. Most expensive is the "special pie" ($21), which rolls on brussels sprouts, bechamel, cantal cheese, buffalo mozzarella, shaved chestnuts, and smoked bacon. How weird is that? You won't be surprised to hear the crust is unimpeachable--cast in a malformed circle, it's light and bouncy, and charred around the edges. Really, if it had that slight sourdough taste of Naples pies, and was a little denser, it might qualify as one of the best evocations of the True Pie of Naples. I tried three pies. The margherita was one of the best pizzas I've tried this year, light and bright, with the random sprawl of buffalo mozzarella adding richness and flash. I enjoyed the "ham and cheese" nearly as much, with three types of cheese (buffalo mozzarella, pecorino [what kind, I wondered.], and--odd man out--a French gruyere, making the pie a little like a croque?monsieur, especially since thin slices of prosciutto were laid across the top like a tarp on a wet field.  Try as I might, I couldn't get myself to like the santo ($17), which featured such incongruous elements as shaved radicchio, onions, bechamel, and three cheeses. Then there are the appetizing cheese and meat plates, a handful of salads, and crostini featuring predictable things like chicken liver and eggplant. Somewhat controversially, bread and olive oil is served with a $5 charge. The menu will be further tinkered with, I'm sure, before the place opens on January 9th. 230 Ninth Avenue, 212-243-1105

Last night, we watched the waiter tell the two diners next to us (who had waited for 40 minutes for a table and who had ordered 20 minutes prior to this) that the restaurant was out of pizza dough. It was not even 10PM. The manager, at first refused to even come to the table to talk with the diners, and when he finally did show up he refused to cover even the cost of the drinks. The couple was irate (and rightly so) and one of the diners used the f-word at which point the manager kicked them out of the restaurant. We were still discussing the horrible treatment the couple had received when NOT TEN MINUTES LATER, the hostess sat another group of 3 diners at the SAME TABLE. We waited for the waiter to come over and humbly apologize for a lack of dough, but instead they brought them FOUR PIZZAS! SO, it appears that you have to be SOMEONE in this town to get decent service (and possibly even PIZZA) at this restaurant. DO NOT GO TO CO. The pizza was fine, but nothing amazing. Definitely not worth a 45 minute wait. And definitely not if you need ANY customer service!

 Looks pretty damn good, right? And who doesn't love a traditional hot breakfast of bacon, eggs, and toast?

This mercery masterpiece was created by a craftsperson known only as jugglerz4.

POST:
Like Lady and the TrampThis week, Our Man Sietsema is in Dyker Heights at Colandrea New Corner Restaurant, which is not new at all, having been founded in 1939. We gather that it's the sort of place that's decorated in the flamboyant style of old Italian aunties--all bad oil paintings and fake classical statuary. Plus, Colandrea offers no less than three different types of lottery to play.But for all its old-world, kitchy charm, the real reason to go here, Our Man says, is that they do classic Italian-American food right. No arugula or Balsalmic vinegar here, just good, old-fashioned spaghetti and meatballs, lasagne, chicken cacciatore, and baked ziti. Colandrea New Corner Restaurant 7201 Eighth Avenue Dyker Heights, Brooklyn 718-833-0800 The lasagna can barely hold the sausage and cheese stuffing between its expansive, well-sauced layers, and a further heap of ground beef on top telegraphs the abundance of meat in the New World. To get spaghetti with meatballs, you must order the components separately. Spaghetti with marinara is $9.50, and a pair of meatballs is $5, re-creating one of the towering triumphs of Italian-American cooking, one that has long been clasped to the bosom of mainstream American cuisine.

I always get a big kick out of Village Voice articles that cover my hometown of Bay Ridge and surrounding parts. They read like anthropological studies of tribes from Borneo and Paupa New Guinea. In addition to the somewhat condescending tone of your article, there are numerous factual problems with it as well. First off, Tomasso's is not in Bay Ridge - it is in Bensonhurst (or perhaps what's left of Bath Beach). The BQE is the dividing line for Bay Ridge, and 14th Ave is the dividing line for Dyker Heights. Tomassos is well east of the former, and somewhat east of the latter. Secondly, your insinuation that there has been any sort of funny business with the free parking spots is low class and poor journalism. You should have done some research into that before spreading innuendoes that merely serve to promote a caricature (most probably based upon your prejudices about “eye”talians). Plus, your amazement of lotto games there demonstrates that you do not get around Brooklyn and the outer boroughs much. These games are staples in many such places. Still, I guess I shouldn’t expect much from writers and editors who grew up in Idaho, Ohio, and Minnesota but like to pretend their clans have been here as long as the Dead Rabbits roamed the Bowery, their grandfathers were Westies, and their moms danced disco at Studio 54.

Yesterday was my lucky day -- I spotted a copy of 101 Fast Funny Food Jokes by Phil Hirsch (New York: Scholastic Books, 1983) sticking out of a trash can in Bay Ridge, and decided to use it as an excuse to inaugurate a new Fork in the Road feature. Who doesn't like a bad food joke? Here are some samples from that sainted volume, beloved of six-year-olds: Where do they hold prizefights in Fastfoodland? In an onion ring! Why did the man climb to the roof of the fast food restaurant? The told him the meal was on the house! Where are the best tacos served? In the Gulp of Mexico! What is the vampire's favorite snack? Neck-tarines! Would octopus make a good fast food? You must be squidding! What food is essential to good music? The beet! Where do burgers like to dance? At a meat ball!

Christmas Dinner Debriefing

Robert Sietsema

POST:
  Every Christmas a bunch of pals and I head down to Chinatown for Christmas dinner. Not only because we love Chinese food, but because we've had enough of Christmas by that time, and need an escape. Chinatown provides a religion-neutral, anti-holiday setting, and accommodating big groups is a natural for them. What's more, Chinese food requires communal dining (though eating off each other's plates is something we do all the time anyway). For years, our Christmas-day standby was Danny Ng (pronounced "Eng") on Pell Street, but it went out of business over a year ago. Luckily, a new version of the restaurant popped up at 52 Bowery on the ground floor, below what was once the Silver Palace. The restaurant specializes in old-guard Cantonese food, but adds some modern Hong Kong and Lower East Side fusion twists. Starting at 4pm, our party of 11 plowed through a total of 12 dishes, not pushing back from the table till around 5:30. Here are some of the highlights:  Fried tofu with black mushrooms and snow peas was a delight,  and so was the beef chow fun, "with gravy."  The cubed flounder with salt and pepper did not seem nearly as greasy as it looks in the picture, and it disappeared in short order,  and so did the "salty fish and chicken fried rice," a Hong Kong-style staple. ? Wisely, I think, we skipped the fusion-ey "house special baked lobster with cheese, but sheer curiosity caused us to order sliced pastrami with spinach. It was a mistake. An obligatory order was Danny Ng's most famous invention--"short rib beef in pumpkin." The waiter dramatically slashes it open with a dangerous looking knife, and this is the result: So, with the?dragons' eyes blinking red and green?above us, that was how we ended our meal. See you next Xmas!

Maharashtrian food is a delight. There is so much variety in Maharashtrian food. It is very healthy compared to North Indian and South Indian food. There was a research done by University of Pittsburgh that said that food from Maharashtra is one of the healthiest. It is sad that there are not many Maharashtrian restaurants in US and in India. Even in cities like Mumbai you have to take effort to find good Marathi food.

Incredibly Cheap Eats -- Scallion Pancake

POST:
  Northern Chinese food has finally infiltrated Manhattan's Chinatown, appearing at its fringes at a tiny new noodle shop with the enticing name of -- Strange Taste. Much of the menu is Fujianese, including delicious soups with duck and taro, and, for lovers of meat and psychedelia, "beef trip with mei fun soup." Look around the edges of the menu, however, for the northern (and western) Chinese stuff. There's a good and greasy rendition of dan dan noodles that will set you back only $4, which is quite hot, but a little low on Sichuan peppercorns (the proprietors have the neighborhood's tender-tongued Cantonese and Fujianese to worry about), but even cheaper is the scallion pancake. While not quite a meal, this doughy tuck-in is much bigger than usual, and served with an armada of sauces, of which my fave is chunky chile. 20 Henry Street (25 Catherine Street), 212-285-8727. The cost: $1

Chapter 2: Reality Sets In [Note--You can read the first chapter of this continuing saga here. A new episode appears every Friday at 9 a.m.] I stared at my faithful stove in disbelief. No flame had appeared when I'd turned on?the burner, and a Con Ed notice on the door downstairs had informed me that the gas had been shut off for the entire building. I later found out it was?due to a leak in one of the apartments upstairs, where some slapdash renovations were in?progress. Drats! My first need was strong coffee, but how to make it? Was I one of those?idiots?so desperate for caffeine, that I'd take hot water from the tap and mix it with instant coffee just to get my fix? Not likely. I donned my coat and headed out to the sainted Garber Hardware on nearby Greenwich Street. It, too, had almost been gentrified out of existence. Its original location was Jackson Square, on Eighth Avenue near Horatio Street, a store so well-stocked and densely packed, that it was common for hardware purchasers to become lost or hopelessly distracted among the aisles of plumbing fixtures, odd-sized screws, lawn ornaments, rubber hoses, drill bits, wood-carving tools, potting soils, seeds, fan belts, diverse gauges, and arcane bits of hardware too old and obsolete?to be identified by hardware historians. The new place on Greenwich Street was more efficiently laid out in two distinct rooms. Most of the heirloom hardware?had been expunged, so the new place wasn't as much fun to browse, which was OK because I was in desperate need of coffee by this time, a thin veil of sweat spreading across my forehead and a tremor evident in my hand. I strode?up to the counter and asked the clerk, whose?skateboard was balanced on the counter beside him, "What do you have in the way of a hot plate?" This was apparently a very common request. With the neighborhood on an upscale tangent, apartments were being renovated on every block, leading to an endless stream of lumber trucks. cable TV vans, pick-ups, and every other sort of delivery and service vehicle, as work crews shuttled in and out of buildings. The noise both inside and out was often ear-splitting. Many renovations were done without benefit of the proper building permits, leading to delays and shutdowns, with?crews wandering off to other buildings?to continue similarly doomed projects.. The clerk led me to a dusty corner of Garber's, and wordlessly pointed a craggy finger at the top shelf, just above a display of pancake flippers, egg beaters, and blenders. A line of hot plates perched above, but after scanning the inventory, I realized there were really only two types, displayed in boxes with cheesy art that suggested they'd been manufactured in the most obscure corners of China. So, my only real dilemma was--one burner or two? Next: I take my new hot plate out for a test drive. Related Content Related Stories...

The Early Word -- Java Village
AUTHOR:
Robert Sietsema
DATE:
2008-12-24 11:10:00
POST:
Java Village is the fourth Indonesian restaurant to appear in Elmhurst in the last three years, and quite unlike any of the others. While Mie Jakarta and Minangasli on Whitney Avenue style themselves as warungs--hawker stalls with a narrow range of specialties--Java Village is more of a steam table cafeteria. A $7 special allows you to choose two meat-bearing dishes and one vegetable dish and have them dumped over a giant pile of white rice, with a sambal or two on the side. Peering into the steamy glass case, you'll see 15 or so choices, but frankly, it's hard to tell the meat from the vegetable matter.? You'd swear jackfruit curry was beef, except for the presence of little nodules among the meaty-looking fibers. Chunks of boiled taro could easily be fish, or some other ocean denizen. Tofu is often cooked to the texture of beef. So take it as a given that, in choosing your combination of dishes, you'll sometimes get the feeling that you haven't quite selected right. The steam table contains no satays and almost no noodle dishes,?though noodles and soups are available on the lengthy menu. But most patronts run in for the steam table. Two over-rice meals are shown. 86-10 Justice Avenue, Elmhurst, Queens, 718-205-2166 ?

Though inspired by Naples pizza, Motorino's pies are cooked in a wood-burning oven that dominates the room (making the premises especially cozy in cold weather). Stippled with char, smoky, and slightly doughy, the marguerita ($10) stands up to any other I've tasted. ??

Peel Noodles in Brooklyn (Plus Incredibly Cheap Dumplings!) 
AUTHOR:
Sarah DiGregorio
DATE:
2008-12-23 15:14:00
POST:
 The amazing noodle-maker in this video is fashioning peel noodles, a specialty from China's Shanxi province. (Better to show you the video than to spend two paragraphs trying to explain how they're made, no?) These fluttery, hand-cut noodles are very popular in Beijing, but New York didn't have any until 2006, when Our Man Sietsema slurped them up at Sheng Wang, a Fujianese noodle shop in Manhattan's Chinatown. The other day, after eating pho for brunch in the Sunset Park, Brooklyn Chinatown, I came across Wong Wong Noodle Soup, a new Fujianese hand-pull noodle spot that also makes the elusive peel noodles. Our Man Sietsema had already sniffed them out, and he maintains that Wong Wong is only the second place in the city to make peel noodles, after Sheng Wang. Today is a noodle soup kind of day, so I thought I'd check out Wong Wong. The incredibly good, incredibly cheap results--complete with noodle glamour shot and dumpling innards--after the jump. Wong Wong is a spotless, no-nonsense spot, with about a dozen tables. In the back corner of the dining room there's a glassed-in area with a wooden countertop, where a cook makes the hand-pulled noodles on a floured surface. He pulls the dough like taffy, until it's about the thickness of spaghetti, and then he slips it directly into a gigantic pot of boiling water. I didn't see the peel noodles being made--but maybe that happens in the back. I ordered the peel noodles in soup with roast duck ($5.50), pictured above. The noodles are irregular, with slightly serrated, wrinkly edges from the quick motion of the knife through the dough. They're almost transparent, and are thick in places and thinner in others; each slurp is chewy and delicate by turns. The pickled greens, roast duck and star-anise-scented broth are also quality, but the noodles are the point. Then, because I am an incorrigible over-orderer, I also got the steamed dumplings. This turns out to be certified cheap eats--$3 for 13 dumplings. The delicate skins make it clear that these dumplings are homemade. Nip through the chewy dumpling skin, you're rewarded with a juicy mixture of pork and scallions; a bit of golden-colored porky broth runs out with the first bite.

Just to set the record straight -- the restaurant alluded to across from Sheng Wang, Super Taste, only has peel noodles occasionally, and they're not on the menu. I sheepishly admit to not knowing that peel noodles were available at the Fujianese stall in the Golden Shopping Mall. I stand corrected. Still, peel noodles are exceedingly rare compared to Lanzhou hand-pulled noodles.

 Nothing says Christmas in?Italy as much as live eels. In central and southern Italy, large eels?lately swum from the Sargasso Sea called capitone are spitted and roasted over a fire on Christmas eve. In Florence, eels from the Po River are stewed with tomato and garlic to make anguilla alla comacchiese, or baked with garlic and sage in anguilla alla fiorentina. In?Venice, where eels are called bisato, they're sauteed in olive oil with bay?leaf. As you can see from the photo, live eels are available at?Metropolitan Fish Market (635 Metropolitan Avenue, Brooklyn) in Williamsburg. YouTube provides concise visual instruction as to how to prepare a live eel. And here's an easy recipe for grilled or fried eel, Neapolitan style.?So get busy!

Xcellent Xmas Present for Foodies -- Fuchsia

POST:
My favorite food book of the year was Fuchsia Dunlop's?Shark's Fin and Sichuan Pepper: A Sweet-Sour Memoir of Eating in China. In it, she tells the amazing story of an Englishwoman going to cooking school in Chengu,?and we sit on the bike with her as she peddles through the Sichuan capital, snacking on?dan dan noodles and other street goodies as she goes.? She develops an idiomatic command of various Chinese dialects, and also sojourns elsehwere in China, making friends in unexpected places, and providing an insider's view of the country, just as it was re-opening to the West. In the second half of the book, she returns to Chengu, to find most of the quaint and fascinating neighborhoods fallen victim?to the wrecking ball as the city is modernized with?no attempt to preserve its historic character. Throughout the book she is humble and self-effacing, and her respect for the culture she studies is immediately evident--though her playful sensibilties make the book hilarious from one end to the other. She is quite the opposite of the ugly English colonialist, and melts the hearts of the?Chinese people she meets. There are a sparing number of recipes, though the best part for me was her explication of Sichuan street snacks and their origins--info available nowhere else that I know of. Other Xcellent Hanakkuh, Kwanzaa, and Xmas presents here and here.

Strange Snacks of the World -- Dragon Fruit

POST:
 Hylocereus undatus--looks kind of Christmasy, right? Nowadays, many of New York's best greengrocers are found in Sunset Park's Chinatown. As my friends and I stepped off the N train at Eighth Avenue and 61st Street, a dozen vegetable stands spilled their gleaming produce onto the sidewalks. And, among the fresh longans, tiny strawberry bananas, and purple six-foot sugar canes, sat boxes of bright pink dragon fruit, with little green flaps coming off the sides like fins on a '57 Chevy. The price was $3.99 per pound, and we got two of them, wieghing a half pound apiece. When we got back to Williamsburg, we quickly halved one of the fruits in a longitudinal manner, then took spoons and scooped out the interior like custard, treating the rubbery skin like a bowl. The interior was pale like lemon ice, and shot with black dots. "Those look like poppy seeds," Michelle exclaimed, scooping up a mouthful. The flesh was tart and gritty in an enjoyable way, tasting something like kiwi. We quickly finished the two halves and sliced the other one, too, wondering if we should use it to invent a new cocktail. "No, let's just eat it right now," Sam chortled. Also known as pitaya, dragon fruit is the pear of an epiphytic cactus species, Hylocereus undatus. It was probably introduced into Vietnam a century ago by the French, who had a colony--now a department of France--called Guyane (French Guiana in English). How ironic, we thought, spooning up the last of the second specimen, that this delicious South American fruit should return to this hemisphere via a Chinese immigrant community.?  ? ? ?

Xcellent Xmas Present for Foodies

POST:
Trudging home in the driving sleet of yesterday, I saw a store that had popped up on 8th Street without much fanfare, maybe one of those Chrismas stores that have become common in Manhattan. They appear a couple of weeks before the holiday, and disappear a day or two after. AC Gears was filled with things I instantly felt attracted to. All of the merchandise seemed to come from Japan, and was of a playful and technical sort. There was an electric strip shaped like a human being, with power cords for arms and legs, an insect robot that responded to loud noises, a shitload of odd accessories for I-pods -- you get the idea. I'm a big fan of thumb drives and instantly fixed on the thumb drive glass case. For something you carry around in your pocket (or on a string around your neck) all the time, why did these devices have to be so cheerless and functional? There in the middle was one that looked like a piece of tuna sushi, with a molded red piece of fish on top and a fairly realistic lozenge of rice underneath. I snapped it up immediately, but I still don't know which foodie friend I'm giving it to. 69 East 8th Street, 212-260-2269 Another xcellent xmas present for foodies here.

  Don't touch that monitor! Those wild purple and lavender hues?are not the result of some defect in your computer, but a color that occurs in nature, believe it or not. Purple is the color of ube (pronounced "ooooo--beeee"), the national root vegetable of the Philippines. "Ube" is?Tagalog for Dioscorea alata, a purple?tuber sweeter than a potato, but not as?sweet as an orange yam. It occurs in Southeast Asia and in India, where it is known as ratalu. The sweetness and moistness of ube is often exploited?in sweet pastries in the Philippines. Filipinos also love the bright purple color, and use it in puddings, cakes, frostings, candies,?breads, and ice creams.?The above specimen comes from the foremost Philippine bakery in the region, Philippine Bread House, long a fixture of the Filipino neighborhood?a few blocks east of Jersey City's Journal Square. Do the above cake and frosting taste like yam? Not in the least -- but both sure are sweet!?530 Newark?Avenue, Jersey City, NJ, 201-659-1753?

Ah...I love all things ube. They do a crazy purple on purple chiffon cake at Engeline's in Woodside. I hate to say it, but I'm pretty sure most of the ube goodies you find around town do use food dye. I'd like to believe that that insane shade is pure tuber, though.

This is like comparing apples to oranges. Achatz's book is what The French Laundry Cookbook was when it came out - a comprehensive restaurant cookbook. If you want to make comparisons, The French Laundry Cookbook has sold 350,000+ copies since 1999. Let's see where the Alinea book is in 9 years and then you can start making comparisons.

POST:
Chapter 1: How It Happened It began innocuously enough. I came home one evening to find a pale green notice crudely taped to the front door of my tenement. It was from Con Ed, and read: "All Gas Service Shut Off Due To Leak On Building Piping." I shrugged and trudged up the stairs to my third floor flat. Such notices were not uncommon. Apartments were being renovated all around me. All day long fire alarms wailed, piles of lumber fell over with loud thuds, and electric saws came to life with a metallic whir, and this had been going on for over a year. A thick carpet of construction dust spread over everything. My West Village building was being converted into a condominium by a shadowy real estate entity that had paid $8 million for the 21-unit building a couple of years previously, even though the asking price had?been $4 million. Even $4 million had seemed high for a building with a crumbling infrastructure, and the building had been on the market for five years at that price. The building (technically, a "New Law" tenement) was really not much to look at. It was built in 1918 with weird, off-white brick, which seemd to get more "off-white" with every passing year. When I moved in, the area surrounding the building had been furnished with bodegas, gypsy fortune tellers, and vegetable stands, but now the neighborhood was being invaded by designer labels--principally Marc Jacobs and Ralph Lauren--who had rudely commandeered multiple storefronts and used them as glitzy, 3-D billboards. It was rare to see anyone buy anything in these stores, where t-shirts ran as high as $600. What's more, Sex in the City had turned my street into a permanent tourist magnet, attracting hordes who lined up in front of Magnolia Bakery to get cupcakes that were three-quarters frosting, before wandering dazedly off to get their pictures taken on the stoop of Carrie's TV house. I reached my apartment on the third floor, nimbly hopping over a pile of construction debris, and turned the key in the lock. Sniffing for gas as I opened the door, I?ran immediately into?the kitchen and inspected my stove. It was the tenement special--four burners forming a tight matrix, so tight that two large pans couldn't fit on adjacent burners. I often had to cook complex meals with pans hanging half-off the?stove. I turned on one of the burners and was relieved to hear the familiar click-click-click of the electric ignition system. Unfortunately, no happy flames leapt up to greet me. Next: I gird my loins and go out to buy a hot plate. [Robert's Note: An installment of this story will appear every Friday morning at 9 a.m., until my gas gets turned back on.] ? ? Related Content Related Stories...

I, Locavore -- Really, Really Local Honey

? The state and federal government have a long list of things they want to prevent you from eating. They don't seem to care that the poultry supply is awash in salmonella, or that animals for human consumption are raised in sadistic ways, and pumped full of hormones and antibiotics. They are, however, very concerned that you might bring some raw milk cheese across the Canadian border, or?sneak in?one of the dozens of prohibited pork products?from Italy. Join me in singing, "Uncle Sam don't want no lardo eatin' round here..."? A couple of years ago, after attending a cheese social in Jimmy's #43, I met a guy who, against all odds, kept bees in a South Bronx community garden in his spare time, while also working at an adjacent church.?Roger Repohl pools his honey by season, so that the late autumn honey is dark with wildflowers, while the clover honey of early summer is a lemony orange, and much lighter tasting. At the cheese shindig, I also enjoyed some honey?that had been made on the roof of an East?Village tenement. In fact, there seems to be no barrier to producing excellent honey in the city, and, according to Repohl, bees prefer the flowers that grow along the highways of the Bronx to what they can get in the community gardens. The only thing that keeps urban honey from being a more major phenomenon is...the city government. The New York City Health Code prohibits honey making in the city, and?goes on to condemn the honeybee as a "venomous insect." Their thinking is positively medieval. If you'd like to affirm your support of city honeybees, please join me in signing this petition?at the Just Foods website. ?

Great name and very easy to make dessert. Made it last night here in Cologne, Germany. I was able to whip it up after dinner and serve it warm before my husband and friends were done huddling festively around a laptop (looking at sneakers online).

I was with Barbara and my two best friends (See March 29th posting). Originally from Queens, visiting from Seattle. That night was the fourth visit to Vesta in 5 days! Each meal was better than the next. I was ready to give up whatever virtue I have left for the Sweet Baby Jesus! recipe. Luckily, it is posted so I can now make the same offer for the pizza dough recipe. The cake is simply one of the best desserts ever, made all the sweeter by those two lovely guys, Guiseppe and Leo. Definitely worth a dedicated trip to Astoria from the Left Coast. I'll be back.

When You'd Rather Not Eat Well

 I know this sounds weird coming from me, but there are times when you'd rather not drag your ass across the boundaries of time and space to get the best possible meal. I pondered this as I gazed upon the bejeweled new Kellogg's Diner rising before me above the L train's Lorimer stop, prior to going in and dining. When the joint was boarded up?several months ago, the general belief?was that this old-timer had bit the dust, and that a slender new?glass condominium tower would soon be rising in its stead. ? Well, we?were all full of shit, and most of us are?glad the diner still occupies this space which can been seen -- but not easily accessed?-- from the?BQE. Just as the premises have become more overblown and?glitzy, so has the menu spiraled out of control. It's a thick, plastic-clad volume that would take weeks of study to master. There's the?new frittata section, for example. Of a half-dozen, would you prefer the Neptune the King frittata (Nova salmon, onions, scallions, tomatoes, and peppers) or the meat lover's frittata (bacon, ham, sausage, and Muenster cheese)? Do you want pancakes with chocolate chips, the Valley Star (?) vegetable platter, or a half-pound bison burger?  Wisely, I think, my companion and?I stuck to the basics: eggs over easy with sausage, and a Texas burger topped with bacon and a?fried egg (Why Texas, we wondered?). The burger was?generous, but rubbery, the sausages good, while the hashbrowns proved unbrowned and unlovely. Sometimes you just want to eat plain food. On the other hand, we could have ordered the one lonely?lobster...?518 Metropolitan Avenue, 718-782-4502

Size of David Bouley's Menu Matters
AUTHOR:
Hailey Eber
DATE:
2008-12-17 9:30:00
POST:
Ouch. Frank Bruni gives David Bouley's newest venture, Secession, no stars in the Times today due in part to "amateurish" service and its menu being the work of "an unfocused, distracted mind." Other critics' review have been somewhat kinder, but everyone agrees on one thing: the menu is big, very big. After the jump, a roundup of Secession reviews, where everyone devotes many words to discussing the shear size and breadth of the "sprawling," "inventive,"? "oddly organized riot" of a menu. "Scrawled and sprawled across it [the menu] is such an oddly organized riot of strangely mismatched options that being able to connect a customer's shorthand request to an actual item requires only slightly less preparation than the bar exam." -Frank Bruni, New York Times "You might be tempted to hand the menu back to your server and say simply, 'Bring me food.' Order a glass of wine instead and put on your reading glasses. It's worth it. 'Secession' may sound like a Southern restaurant, but it's actually a union of Italian and French kitchens - from Cesare Casella and David Bouley."-Danyelle Freeman, New York Daily News"The sprawling menu is almost defiantly unfocused. House-made terrines and pates give Bar Boulud a run for its money. There are also tons of grilled and roasted meats, Modern-American "classics," salads, and oysters and clams."-Steve Cuozzo, New York Post"The tables in the dining room are decorated with elderly, withering flower arrangements, and the cheesy, pine-green napkins and dun-brown chairs look like they've been heisted from the barroom of a not-very-prosperous golf club in suburban New Jersey. The menu at Secession is a similar jumble of tired brasserie conceits, and it's too long by half." -Adam Platt, New York"Secession has a big, not especially inventive menu loaded with bistro classics like steak frites, roast duck, and various risotti, along with a selection of high end charcuterie, some pastas, and what seems like dozens of other options."-Josh Ozersky, Citysearch

For amateurish service it's hard to beat Bouley Bakery. It just moved into the old Bouley restaurant space, which is larger. But the service is still ridiculously slow and disorganized. The staff moves like they're under water.

So, too, are the cha gio (spring rolls, four for $3.50) way better than those found elsewhere. The delicate pastry flutes contain a mellow combo of pork, crab, mushrooms, and clear mung-bean vermicelli. They've been fried more aggressively than usual, resulting in a deep caramelized brown color and a superior crunch. Wrap them in iceberg with fresh mint, dip them in sharp vinegar, and rocket yourself to gastronomic nirvana.

Xcellent Xmas Present for Foodies

POST:
 A friend and I were traversing Manhattan's Chinatown the other evening on the way to one of Mark Bello's wonderful pizza parties when we spotted it--a storefront on Mott that seemed exclusively devoted to chopsticks! Once inside, we were regaled with an unbelievable selection of the sticklike eating implements, many in colorful presentation boxes. What's more, many of the chopstick sets came with their own ceramic chopstick rests, and many of the boxes had themes to them.  As I tried to take photos for you to better visualize the wonderfulness of the chopsticks, the proprietor came running up to me waving his hands, "No photos, no photos!" as if the place were a maximum security institution filled with state secrets, and I was a chopstick terrorist bent on chopstick mayhem. We did manage to get off a few surreptitious shots however. While many of the presentation boxes ran as high as $100 or more, the chopsticks therein coated with gold leaf or inlaid with mother of pearl, I quickly fixed on one of the more modest offerings--a boxed set of two pairs that had an "Eat Your Veggies" theme, maybe aimed at picky-eater kids. The chopstick rests were a pair of yellow and pink beets, at least I think they were beets. I snapped it up for $14 plus tax. I'm not sure which foodie friend I'm giving it to, but I delight to think of her sometime next year sitting in her favorite Japanese sushi parlor in the East Village. As the sushi assortment arrives, she whips out her own private chopsticks and chopstick rests, as the other diners watch enviously, looking down disdainfully at their own disposible chopsticks. Inside the magnetized cover of the box, which snaps shut with a smart "Click," is a poem that extols the chopsticks in a few lines of cryptic verse: The Love Lavender Chopsticks of Yunhong Chopsticks write a romantic Song of praise, murmuring the beauty And romance of love. It immerses You in a purple wonderland, which Is full of lavender. It keeps you and Your lover from the noisy and Annoying of the mortal World and brings you to a land Of tranquil and peace. Gee, and I just wanted them for picking up morsels of food...? Yunhong Chopsticks, 50 Mott Street, 212-566-8828

Strange Snacks of the World -- Doubleheader!
AUTHOR:
Robert Sietsema
DATE:
2008-12-15 12:38:00
POST:
 Today's SSW is a doubleheader. The first snack we found at a 7 Eleven somewhere downtown--we hesitate to reveal the exact location, since we want to keep this snack all to ourselves. (No, just kidding! This thing sucks.) While buying various Christmas Peeps for stocking stuffing we stumbled on a plastic wrapped piece of poundcake, a treat we can not easily pass up. A label hastily (and crookedly) pasted on the cellophane wrapper indicated that this was not any random poundcake, but a 7-Up poundcake. Is it flavored with 7-Up, we wondered. Once we'd wrestled with the wrapper, and munched a corner of the slice, we realized that there was no 7-Up flavor. It was just your standard, oversweet, fat-laced pastry treat. An examination of the?ingredients label confirmed this. On the 36-item ingredient list, there is no 7-Up. Which is good, as far as we're concerned, because we hate the taste of 7-Up. But the question lingers: Why would 7-Up want to brand this emphatically generic?and characterless snack?product??  Luckily, Snack #2 is much more distinguished. It's a bag of chips, a little pricey at $3.99, which we buy whenever we stumble across it in a Southeast Asian store,?most recently at a banh mi parlor in Sunset Park and a Cambodian bodega in Fordham, the Bronx. The chips are called Trai Cay Say, and?the 7 ounce bag contains oodles of fried fruit chips, including jack fruit, sweet potato, taro, banana, and pineapple. The chips are crisp and delicious, with no trace of greasiness, and no saltiness. The only ingredients besides fruit are corn oil and sulfite. Could it be these toothsome chips are actually "healthy"? We hope so, because we intend to continue eating them.

Taste Test -- Claude's Patisserie
AUTHOR:
Robert Sietsema
DATE:
2008-12-12 15:11:00
POST:
 After three months that left us on tenterhooks, longtime West Village favorite Patisserie Claude has reopened--sans Claude. The gruff French pastry chef has left the business in the hands of his able assistant Pablo, who was able to arrange financing to keep the place open. After a renovation that left the premises looking identical as far as we can tell, the place is once again packed with happy croissant eaters. The signed picture of violinist (and Django Reinhardt pal) Stephane Grappelli is gone, presumably returned to France with Claude. In its?stead is a picture of Claude and?Pablo, who is the new pastry chef. We delighted to see Pablo once again at work among the convection ovens in the cramped?room behind the counter, training a new assistant. But what about the croissants? A FITH taste test indicates that they are as good as ever, just a little different. The butteriness and flakiness remain, but the croissants are less tightly twisted, a little browner, and the almond croissant oozing a little more of the creamy marzipan custard. As in the days of Claude, the pan au chocolat had run out, and we've got to remember to get there before 10 a.m. next time. We'll miss the sight of Claude peering myopically through the kitchen window, though, his?gray locks tousled as if he'd been in the bakery all night long. He probably had. 118 West 4th Street, 212-255-5911 ?

POST:
? Dinner begins with free papadams and chutneys The room dramatically snakes past a bar, culminating in one of those "wall of water" installations. Despite the fast-food-sounding name, Indian Express is a resolutely upscale Indian restaurant in an obscure?location in the vicinity of City Hall.  Bhel poori makes a fine shared starter The food is mainly Punjabi and mainly good, with the street snack bhel poori making one of the best starters. Among the unusual tweakings of tandoori evident on the menu, cornish hen hariyali is one of the more interesting -- a pullet, really, thickly coated with green mint paste and thrust into the?vertical clay oven. It comes out looking?kinda scary, but tastes good anyway. ? The cornish hen hariyali isn't too sightly, but it sure is tasty The lamb vindaloo's fine, too, mainly big chunks of lamb in a deep red sauce with a fair amount of heat. Many entrees?hover just?south of $20, and some exceed it. 18 Murray Street, 212-608-5555?

Incredibly Cheap Eats -- Stall 38, Golden Shopping Mall
AUTHOR:
Robert Sietsema
DATE:
2008-12-12 10:38:00
POST:
 Stall 38, downstairs at the Golden Shopping Mall, features the food of Xian, a province in China adjacent to Inner Mongolia. The comfy seating area is surrounding by color photos of all the stall's offerings, making a common language unnecessary. One of the best (and quickest) dishes is the so-called Chinese burger -- really, a homemade pita slit and stuffed with lamb sauteed with plenty of Asian cumin, the seeds of which are smaller, darker, and more pungent than Western cumin, the kind ubiquitous in Mexican cooking. If you want to settle for the equally tasty pork version of the Chinese burger, it costs 50 cents less. The menu also features all sorts of noodle and spongy tofu dishes, all less than $5, and some fiery as hell. 41-28 Main Street, Flushing, Queens. The cost: $2.50?

I agree completely. Stall 38 also has English translations of the menu to accompany the photos, which isn't typical on Main St. The lamb burger is better than the cheaper pork burger and worth the extra 50 cents. The next stop should be Temple Snacks in a new food court at 135-28 Roosevelt Ave. The Taiwan Sandwich is the same pita with an enormous piece of pork belly in it. The Liang Pi at Stall 38 is excellent also.

Our second exposure was?stall 38 in Flushing's Golden Mall, which is still open and doing business. Tianjin is apparently known for the healthfulness of its?food, and as if to confirm this, stall 38 offers salads featuring such fresh ingredients as Chinese celery, toasted peanuts, and various forms of pressed and smoked tofu. The stall also makes small round dumplings stuffed with pork and leeks, and serves a garlic sausage that tastes?suspiciously like kielbasa. Lo and behold, another Tianjin institution has appeared in Flushing, this time with its own storefront, albeit a narrow one. Apparently, there are a significant number of immigrants from Tianjin in Queens. Flying in the face of the other Tianjinese institutions, Tian Jin Chinese Restaurant specializes in charcuterie, though the product is of a far different sort than you'd find in a southern Chinese charcuterie?(ducks, roast pork, etc.). The place is not really much of a restaurant, since there's no?seating, but the display of animal flesh in the glass case is amazing, if not always enticing. Pride of place goes to braised pig feet, neatly lined up like soldiers on the way to battle. The braising liquid certainly includes soy sauce, sugar, and sherry wine, and?five-spice powder provides further?oomph! Yes, the feet are rubbery, and it's hard to get at the meat, fat, and skin wedged between the bones, but the?taste is pretty damn good, if you've got plenty of patience. Also lined up are braised kidneys and pig hearts, anatomically perfect and worth studying before you wolf them down. Less challenging, perhaps, are the braised pullets -- small chickens that look delicious in the glass case.?Other organ meats are on display, but you'll have to go there yourself to identify them. (Note: Entrance around the corner on Prince Street). 135-02 Roosevelt Avenue,?Flushing, Queens, no phone? ?

A Nibble from Chef Jason Denton

POST:
This week, VV dining newsletter writer Hailey Eber spoke to chef Jason Denton (of Lupa, 'ino and 'inoteca) about his new cookbook, Simple Italian Snacks. He gave us the recipe for one of those simple Italian snacks. It is indeed very easy, and doesn't feature obscure ingredients. (Except maybe the ricotta salata. In a pinch, sub Parmesan.) Here's what Denton has to say about the recipe: This is a great recipe for salad greens that have lost their looks: wilt them down to their most flavorful, spread them on toasts, and suddenly your bruised arugula and watercress have found new life. The flavor is sophisticated, with ricotta salata lending a salty coolness to the bitter flavor of the greens. The ingredients are in your crisper drawer for this, one of my budget favorites." Get the recipe, after the jump. Jump! Bruschetta of Wilted Bitter Greens and Ricotta Salata Yield: 8 bruschetta 4 cups tightly packed bitter greens (arugula, watercress, radicchio, or a combination) 8 teaspoons olive oil sea salt 8 garlic cloves, crushed 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 8 baguette slices, cut 1/2-inch thick on the diagonal, toasted 4 ounces ricotta salata Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. On a sheet pan, arrange the greens in 8 small handfuls. drizzle a teaspoon of the olive oil over each handful, and sprinkle each with sea salt. Top each with a crushed garlic clove. Place sheet pan in the oven, and bake for 10 minutes, fluffing each handful of greens after 5 minutes. Remove the greens into a mixing bowl, and let them cool to room temperature. Use tongs to transfer greens to a cutting board, leaving any liquid behind. Roughly chop the greens, and transfer them to a clean bowl. Drizzle with the extra-virgin olive oil. To serve, spread a tablespoon of the wilted greens over each toast. Top with a grating of ricotta salata, and a bit more sea salt. Serve on a platter.

?In conjunction with?my review of the newly opened Roosevelt Food Court in Flushing, here are some porny pictures of the food served there.  Af stall B5, find "scallion pie with beef," a favorite of Shandong province that consists of a flaky scallion pancake wrapped around spears of cucumber and five-spice beef.  At the Sichuan stall, A3, regale yourself with crunchy pig ear in red chile oil, or  mellow Sichuanese pork sausage, or  Homemade mung-jelly noodles heaped with red chiles (left) and tendon in chile oil with Sichuan peppercorns and peanuts?(right).  The neat mis-en-place at stall B3 is used to assemble soups such as  this one, which can be had with a selection of noodles. The proprietors are from Liaoning.  Also associated with Liaoning is the miraculous shar bing, a pork-stuffed pancake served with a soy-laced hot sauce. Find it at stall A5.  The Taiwanese (stalls A1-A2) are responsible for this rice-starch pudding topped with scrumptious ground pork and pickles.  From the same double stall swims a red fish pastry stuffed with red bean paste. Unfortunately, my dining companions wolfed if down before I could reach it to take a photo. It's that good.

Strange Snacks of the World -- Fish Cheese
AUTHOR:
Robert Sietsema
DATE:
2008-12-9 15:00:00
POST:
 Cheese has become wildly popular in parts of Asia over the last few years. Japan, in particular, has been smitten with cheese lust. The only problem is -- no cows. How to make cheese without any cows, and without having to import milk at disadvantageous exchange rates? The answer -- cod! While?New Yorkers?may regard cod as an endangered species, or as an expensive entree in an upscale restaurant, the Japanese now regard it as a source of cheese. Indeed, the above snack represents the Frankensteinian transformation of seafood into a cheese-like substance. The package reads Cheese-Tara, the latter word meaning "codfish"?in Japanese. Indeed, the list of ingredients?on the glued-on back panel?reads: "Ingredients - cod fish, wheat starch, corn oil, salt, sorbitol." Then paradoxically continues -?"Allergy Information: Contains milk and wheat." After eating several faux-lacto slivers, I'm convinced that the ingredients list is right. There is no milk?in this cheese. You're wondering: What does it taste like? The slender stalks of oily off-white, seemingly intended?to resemble string cheese, taste a hell of a lot like processed cheese--salty, slippery, and not the least fishy. Definitely of interest to the lactose intolerant, but not of much interest to?vegetarians. Could we make mac and cheese with it? The jury is still out. Get yours at M2M, 55 Third Avenue,?and tell them the Voice sent you. Yum! Fake cheese. But please don't eat the desiccant (left). ?

A few problems with this article: First, cheese snacks like this are intended to be nibbled as accompaniments to sake, beer or some other alcoholic drink, certainly not served as "the cheese course" after dinner! For that, Japan does indeed have a fine array of cheeses, including imports from around the world and domestic cheeses based on milk produced in the northern island of Hokkaido. There are plenty of cows here, but, unsurprisingly, you won't find them around the big cities. Second, the product in question does contain milk, as noted in the list of ingredients. I think cheese foods like this are an outgrowth of kamaboko, a firm fish paste which is sliced and served with soy sauce or as an ingredient in noodle dishes or stews. It's common for Japanese companies to play around with Western foods and turn them out in forms Westerners would find surprising...Potato salad sandwich, anyone, or a slice of raisin butter?

Ooh, I loved this snack when I lived in Tokyo. The combo of plastic-textured cheese and chewy dried cod is heaven. It's not actually fake cheese - the Natori tara-cheese pictured is cod, ground and spread into a sheet, which is then sandwiched with a layer of processed cheese. (They must have labelled the translated ingredients wrong..) Natori makes various types, using cheddar, 'natural' or 'danish blend' cheeses. You can get basil 'pizza la' flavour - and any of them are quite good grilled in the oven for a few minutes until crispy. As BDH commented, they're a great drinking snack (O-tsumami). Here's a link to that brand's various offerings: http://www.natori.co.jp/app-natori/servlet/product.product.Genre2List?GENRE1=5&GENRE2=1 At this link you can see a picture of a dried cod sheet, pre-cheese: http://blog.goo.ne.jp/fushigi_tanken/e/6b2df133e54eee394e2e0f26863a8ce3

Feh. It sounds pretty good, but $7 bucks for a kati roll is pretty steep, especially when they charge for the chilis and don't even use parathas. This is basically a farangi rip-off.

The roaster itself is strangely compact at Roasting Plant Coffee When I was in California's Silicon Valley not too long ago, I couldn't help but notice that many of the coffee bars had their own roasters - blackened and ancient looking apparati whose flues snaked across ceilings. And, without getting too analytical, I'd have to say the coffee tasted much better as a result. Why not roast coffee on the same premises on which it is brewed? Local coffee bar owners have been talking about it for some time now, but few have moved to effectuate the idea. The usual reason offered is simply that there's no room for hulking roasters in the tiny coffee bars of Manhattan. But they all realize that adding roasting to their repertoire of techniques couldn't help but enhance their reputations and improve their coffee. The awesome Bodum coffee mug Now along comes Roasting Plant Coffee, a new Manhattan coffee bar that eschews the woody, cushioned, counter-culture ambiance of most coffee bars. In fact, the premises looks downright corporate and slick, as if the place had been transplanted from the Mall of America. Long glass cylinders plastered on one wall display beans from ten international sources (Ethiopia, Sumatra, Kenya, India, Colombia, etc.) in their roasted and unroasted state. Inset in the circular counter, inside which the coffee is brewed, are glass cases that display pastries and chocolates. The brewed coffee is on the expensive side, but then you're paying for the gimmick. Coffee is served for on-premises consumption in clear Bodum mugs that insulate your hands from the heat in a space-age fashion with a cushion of air between the layers of the cup. Clearly, the interior designer was thinking of a coffee bar in a space station, rather the venerable institutions frequented by Boswell and Dr. Johnson. Hey, the coffee's good. But will this roasting thing catch on? 75 Greenwich Avenue, 212-775-7755

What Wine Goes With Pizza?

POST:
The special artichoke pie at Motorino, shown with a splendid bottle of Gragnano ? I was sitting in an internationally famous pizza parlor recently, one in which you're permitted to bring your own wine. Three French-speaking guys sat down next to me, and one reached under his coat and pulled out an $80 bottle of Brunello to go with the cheese pizza he'd just ordered. A wave of nausea swept over me as I contemplated drinking that complex, expensive, super-saturated, aged-in-oak wine with pizza. Dudes! Why not just pour the bottle down the toilet? You're totally wasting it. ? Go to the sainted pizza parlors of Naples, and what beverages are they serving? It sure ain't wine. In fact, your choice is generally limited to Italian beer and - that other great Italian invention -- Coca Cola. Everyone knows that beer goes great with pizza. But what if you want to drink wine? Nothing wrong with that. ? In looking for the perfect pizza wine, you need to look no further than the Sorrento peninsula, which extends into the sea south of Naples like the bony finger of Vesuvius. In that rugged precinct is produced a red wine that is often drunk with pizza, which is a regional staple for residents and tourists alike. The pizzas of Sorrento are lusher and larger than their Naples counterparts, which are delightful in their austerity. (Note that I don't say "Neapolitan" - that forever designates the magnificent thin-crust pies of Brooklyn and the rest of our city.) ? Gragnano is purple, slightly fizzy, and not exactly what you'd call dry. It has historically been made in the town of Gragnano from a combination local grapes that includes piedirosso, sciascinoso, and aglianico. The number of acres under cultivation has dwindled in the peninsula over the last decades, making the wine rarer, though it is now protected by D.O.C. status. Gragnano easily stands up to a cheesy, doughy, oily pizza without trying to outfox it with excess complexity. In fact, the two marry well, and you'll look forward small gulps between each bite of pizza. It's better than washing your pie down with Coke. Though maybe not as good as beer. ? A Gragnano made by Cantine Federiciani Monteleone can be purchased for $13.99 at Astor Wines and Spirits, 399 Lafayette Street, 212-674-7500

Only Frenchies would be pretentious, and dumb enough, to drink Brunello with pizza. But plenty of inexpensive vino rosso goes well with a pie. In Napoli and its environs, the "locali," i.e., inexpensive, young, locally-produced wines, are fine with pizza. These usually are served in carafes. But a Gragnano, as you say, also "accompagna bene" a pizza. Must be the aglianico grapes.

?  Located on a dark stretch of Church Street west of Chinatown, Macao Trading Company is unheralded by any sign, except for a door screened over by an usual metal grate, and a red lamp that appears to be hanging upside down over the entrance. The menu seeks to evoke the twin cuisines of Portugal and its former Chinese colony of Macao. Thus there are a pair of parallel menus: Manila clams cooked Portuguese and Chinese style,? meatballs Portunese and?Chinese style,?and cow stomach tripe cooked the same pair of ways. The dishes are grouped as either small or large, and one does best to hopscotch around the longish menu. Our favorite dish on a first visit came down to two: a bowl of picture perfect, thin-skin chicken dumplings knee-deep in an oily and fiery Sichuan sauce; and (picture above), Manila clams cooked Portuguese style with chorizo in a delightful brick-red sauce, from which the taste of garlic leapt out like an open-palm hand coming across the room to slap you in the face. We liked most of the food, and are looking forward to coming back. 311 Church Street, 212-431-3642

Hi NYC Food Guy, Thanks for reading! Yes, it looked to me like the torta de la casa will be available from now on. It hasn't been added to the permanent menu signboard yet, so I guess it's possible they may discontinue it. But my guess is that it'll be there. Even so, there will always be the 22 options, and so many of them are so ridiculously over-the-top that you won't be sorry you made the trip. Let me know how it goes! Sarah

Flushing Kebabs Crawl Indoors

? The imperially long and strange-looking street carts that vend lamb and chicken kebabs dusted with Asian cumin and chile pepper and flamed over charcoal have become a fixture of Flushing in the last three years. They represent the second incursion into the city of food from Xinjiang, the remote far western province of China that lies along the Silk Road, across the border from Kazakhstan, the land of Borat. (The first incursion was a pair of Xinjiang restaurants in Brighton Beach.) These kebabs are similar, though not so opulent, as the ones found at Uzbekistani and Tajikistani restaurants in Brooklyn and Queens. But what they lack in size, they make up for in pungent salty flavor. At the newly opened Roosevelt Food Court in Flushing, these delicious kebabs have moved out of the cold and into a hawker stall for the first time, while miraculously retaining their $1 price tag. Eyili Kabab King (Stall B1), offers not only the expected beef and chicken kebabs, but others made of lamb liver and "ox" liver (it's just beef), as well. Once again, you must ask for "spice" in order to get the all-important rubbing of cumin and chile. The menu rounds itself out with chai tea, baked or fried samsa (lamb turnovers etymologically related to Indian samosas), and pilaf - the dish called "plov" in Uzbeki joints, a casserole of mutton and rice sweetened with carrots. (Somewhat comically, the Xinjiang places in Brighton Beach called it "fried rice.") Some days, there may be shorba and homemade noodles, too, depending on the ambition of the cooks. In the picture, note the tossed iceberg lettuce salad that has wormed its way onto the pilaf plate. That's pure Americana! 135-28 Roosevelt Avenue, Flushing, Queens, no phone.

Strange Snacks of the World - Poutine
AUTHOR:
Robert Sietsema

POST:
 Not to be confused with the former prime minister of Russia, poutine is Quebecois soul food, a crazy toss of French fries, pale squeaky cheese curds, and brown gravy. Since this is really French food we're talking about, the gravy is not the floury kind that comes in cans, but a sort of transparent demi-glace. ? I've got to admit to being kinda fond of poutine, but I really only eat it when I go to Montreal. My favorite place there is Union Pool Hall, but you can get it in nearly any fast-food establishment in the Francophone parts of town. Upscale restaurants offer all sorts of souped-up versions, and I've loved these too, including the one at Globe decorated with duck confit, and the one at Au Pied de Cochons featuring foie gras. ? But it was with some trepidation that I learned recently that McDonald's had started serving it. As an American gourmand, could I even be seen entering a McDonald's in Montreal? ?  But enter I did, the branch accessible through the lobby of the Gare Centrale. The poutine cost slightly over $4 in Canadian money, including tax, which would come out to about $3.25 in American money at current exchange rates. Compared to other renditions, it was a bit undersalted, the fries were too pale, and the cheese curds a little less squeaky than usual, though the gravy was oddly acceptable. Maybe it had been made from the grease on the griddle, because I've never seen canned gravy that looked like that. All-in-all, not a bad rendition, though, with so many in town, who'd go to McDonald's for it? The best part, is that it represents McDonald's rather lame attempt to be Canadian. ? By the way, several variations on poutine--some of them quite good--are available locally at The Inn LW12.?? ? ?

Hey Joey, nice to hear from you. Yeah, I'd never get poutine in Toronto -- that's where all the Anglophone Montrealers went to, and they've got an axe to grind with the French speakers. They're probably trashing their poutine.

 Street food was, until recently, but a wan presence in Flushing's Chinatown. But now the new northern and western Chinese immigrants have upped the ante with zestier and more profuse street fare. Carts from Xinjiang by way of Peking have profferred fatty lamb kebabs dusted with cumin and hot paprika on every other corner, while windows have popped open all along the western side of Main Street below Roosevelt, slinging brochettes of?fish cake boiled in?crimson oil,?freshly made scallion pancakes the size of?phonograph albums, assorted fresh dumplings, and the delicacy pictured above, an individual, hand-held?serving of Peking duck. While you might have thought Peking duck was a dish fit for effete banquets, here it is ably translated into street fare. It begins with a flat steamed bun,?folded over a few morsels of densely flavorful duck,?scraps of glistening duck skin, and?narrow spears of cooling cucumber. It is then finished with a salty and sweet squirt of brown hoisin sauce. Brilliant! Corner 28 Inc., 4028 Main Street, Flushing, 718-886-6628. The cost: $1 ? ? ? ?

Weekend Special: Recipe for the World's Greatest Veggie Burgers 
AUTHOR:
Robert Sietsema
DATE:

POST:
If there's one thing vegetarians still crave from the world of meat, it's hamburgers. But the frozen patties they pull from supermarket freezer cases are the palest of imitations - rubbery hockey pucks of textured vegetable protein (TVP) laced with rancid-tasting onion powder and mystery fats. Unless you glop them up with every available topping and condiment, you'll find yourself disappointed. Most do-it-yourself recipes for veggie burgers are marginally better - composed of chick peas, black beans, vegetable mélanges, or - Buddha help us! - a single grotesque Portobello mushroom cap. (Good as it might be when charcoal grilled, that's not a burger -- it's a mushroom sandwich!) Now I've discovered a recipe that not only looks like a beef-bearing burger, but tastes like one, too. The secret is chopped and steamed eggplant mixed with rich free-range eggs bound with flour and wheat germ - the latter has long been the holy grail of health food faddists. The trick is frying the patty beyond perfect brownness till it looks almost burned -bits of skin enhance the dark color, and the patty becomes miraculously crisp and flavorful, while remaining juicy on the inside. What's more, when you bite into it, even the interior looks like ground beef. Robert's Look-Just-Like-Ground-Beef Veggie BurgersMakes six burgers 1 large (approx. 1½ pound) eggplant, or two medium-size ones 3 tablespoons flour 2 tablespoons wheat germ 3 free-range chicken eggs 1 green onion 2 cloves garlic 1 shallot ½ teaspoon salt ¼ teaspoon coarsely ground pepper Cooking oil (peanut or grape seed oil preferred, but olive oil will do) 6 supermarket seeded hamburger buns Slices of American or Cheddar cheese (optional) Cut eggplant into a 1/2 -inch dice, skin, seeds, and all. Put the eggplant into the basket of a steamer, and steam over water for 30 minutes with the lid on, or until the eggplant is soft, slimy, and mooshy. Drain eggplant in a colander for five minutes, and put in a mixing bowl with flour and wheat germ. In a separate bowl, beat the eggs, then put them into the mixing bowl with the eggplant mixture. Add minced green onions, green and white parts included. Using a garlic press, squeeze in two cloves of garlic, and do the same thing to the shallot, too, if it fits in the press. If not, mince finely and add to the mixture. Add salt and pepper and mix thoroughly. Let sit for one hour. Mixture will be damp and runny. Pour enough oil in the bottom of a non-stick pan to cover the bottom. Heat until nearly smoking. Using an ice cream scoop or big rounded spoon, scoop up some of the hamburger mixture and deposit it in the oil. Mixture will sizzle, and cubes of eggplant will form a little hillock, but this will gradually subside. Cook until the bottom of the patty appears nearly black, then flip the patty and cook the other side. Prepare buns by toasting, and layering with tomato and onion. If cheese is desired, a slice may be put on top of each patty as the second side is cooked to melt the cheese. If necessary, cook the patties in two batches. Serve immediately with mustard and ketchup and garnish with a dill pickle spear. Veggie burger garnishes

A Man, A Plan, A Van -- Barbecue!
AUTHOR:
Robert Sietsema
DATE:

POST:
Rumors had been filtering in for nearly two months of a red van parked inside a roofless garage just off Quincy and Bedford in Bed-Stuy, a van that made and vended barbecued meats. I ignored the rumors for a long time, because frankly how could it be that good --?I mean Hill Country or Fette Sau good? Well, a friend finally lured me there with the promise that we could buy the barbecue and then eat it in her car. (I hadn't cottoned much to eating it out in the street in the cold weather.) I arrived to discover the nose of a red van sticking out of a white cinder block building, which had apparently once been?a car-repair garage, because the prices of various automotive procedures were listed on the wall in English and Spanish. Moreover, a good smell was wafting out the door of the van, which was open. Also wafting out was the sound of a guy singing to himself. The pitmaster wore white. He wiped his hands on his apron as he told a story about coming here from Kansas City ten years ago and dreaming of opening a barbecue.? Indeed, the Kansas City style ribs were quite good, long bones still barely conjoined, blackened and rubbed with barbecue sauce. At $10 for a half rack, they were a steal. I naturally wanted to try the brisket, which is my favorite barbecued meat. The beef was sliced thick, sported a serious-looking smoke ring and was nicely rimmed with fat. I was amazed at the smokiness of it, but, truth be told, the meat was a litte tougher than I like. Still, that didn't prevent me from sending several thick slices stomachward. The dude showed me his smoker, which was a smallish stainless steel cabinet, currently empty. "What do you stoke it with?" I inquired. "Wood chips and propane," he quickly admitted, with not a trace of shame in his voice. But he quickly added, "I get plenty of smoke that way, believe me." And I believe he did. The pitmaster is prone to throw in some meat-dotted barbecued beans when you buy barbecue, and a shifting constellation of sides is available, of which I most recommend the jalapeno cheese grits. The truck is prone to whisk off to remote Brooklyn locales at a moment's notice ("This weekend I'm in Dumbo," he noted.), so it's wise to call ahead and see what his schedule is. 168 Qunicy Street, Brooklyn, 347-881-6696 ?

Couldn't agree more. This season has been a huge disappointment. They have the cultural culinary epicenter at their disposal and have not taken advantage of it in the least. Like you said, the tie-in's are absurd. It almost makes me think that the show's producers think we're morons. Taping a Super Bowl episode during World Series time. Faking a Thanksgiving episode. Really, what's the point. Everyone knows the show is pre-taped months back. We're not looking for day-to-day relevancy here, so why do they keep faking it. We're looking for up and coming chefs with a personality and skill sets competing in interesting challenges. Enough with all the ancillary garbage. They will start to lose the real viewership if they keep this up.

This season appears to possess goals related to hard-edged yet very shallow reality shows a la any vomit found within MTV's programming. Moreover, with heavily reduced talent levels and a flatly transparent, self-centered replacement of Gail Simmons, the producers are all but forced to squeeze any semblance of something deemed "interesting" from a collective lacking any tangible depth.

Toby is a total douchebag. When actual chef judges criticize, it matters. This food critic just gets off on his own one-liners and has NADA to offer. Toby did seem to soften a bit, but it just makes him appear even more pathetic and useless, constantly looking for Tom to throw him a bone in the guise of a smile at his half-assed jokes, like some spoiled brat that the rest only tolerate. I bet the other judges miss Gail even more than we do... Stefan looks so good, b/c the rest are so damn horrible. What a letdown.

Last Night's Brunello Tasting at the Hilton
AUTHOR:
Robert Sietsema
DATE:
2009-01-29 11:33:00
POST:
The tumultuous scene inside one of the Hilton ballrooms at Vino 2009, the Italian wine tasting I almost never?accept invitations to promotional events, but when I got a card a few weeks ago admitting me and a friend to a tasting of the newly released 2004 Brunellos, I thought a few seconds and enthusiastically replied in the affirmative. Made exclusively from a clone of the sangiovese grape in a region surrounding the town of Montalcino in Tuscany, Brunello is Italy's most revered wine, but also one of its most expensive. Under normal circumstances, I get to drink a glass maybe twice a year, so the opportunity to sample 45 on a single evening was irresistible. I invited my friend Rachel, and we arrived around 6:30 on the second floor of the Hilton near Times Square to find a maze of ballrooms filled with milling wine enthusiasts, including pinkie-in-the-air connoisseurs, wine distributors, flacks, journalists, and owners of bars that mainly serve beer in small Jersey towns.  "I once drank a bottle this big," the salesman says to the vintner But we quickly discovered that the tasting was not restricted to Brunellos. There were ballrooms devoted to wines from Lombardy, Calabria, and the Veneto, in addition to other regions of Tuscany, numbering hundreds upon hundreds of wines in bewildering array. The noise level was cacaphonous, and even making progress through the rooms required effort. Eventually we determined that the Brunellos were ensconced in the most interior ballroom, the holy of holies, which we finally wandered into. Supplicants stood four or five deep in front of the most venerable producers. Though the ostensible subject of the tasting was a preview of the soon-to-be-released 2004 vintage,?some producers were showboating with vertical tastings of many vintages. When you finally reached the pouring station for a certain producer, the vintner's rep would size you up, and if he thought you were a rube, he'd try to pour?some of the vineyard's lesser productions or one of the lesser years of his Brunellos. Let the sipper beware! Now, in a professional wine tasting, one uses a new glass for every taste, swirls the wine in the bottom of the glass, sniffs and sips, and then tosses the extra wine into a slop bucket, also spitting out the wine in one's mouth.This wine being Brunello, I couldn't think of either tossing or spitting, and most of my fellow amateur tasters were in the same boat. When we arrived in the room, there were already people who'd sampled a little too much Brunello, who leaned on the tables, reeled across the dance floor, or sleepily planted themselves at the raised tables that ringed the ballroom. The Consorzio del Vino Brunello di Montalcino had provided us with attractive spiral notebooks which featured one producer per page and offered a picture of the wine label, address, and contact numbers for the winery, and copious lined space in which to inscribe your notes. But what soldier can keep serious records under battle conditions? We plunged into the room, sometimes sampling wines from producers we'd heard of, but more often sampling Brunellos not even seriously distributed in the United States. I managed to write some notes pall mall on a pair of facing pages, becoming progressively more tipsy as we made our way around the great circle of tables.  "I'm so lonely," says the winemaker's rep. The Lisini rep was pouring the 2004 vintage of the regular Brunello, but he must have had his flagship Ugolaia under the table. Nevertheless, the regular Brunello had tannins firmly in control and reminded us of a cherry orchard, but lacked a little bit of zip. The Coldisole Brunello '04 tasted slightly corked; we wrinkled our noses and moved on. We agreed that the La Lecciaia smelled like truffles, while Rachel said of La Togata's Brunello, "This tastes like canned tuna." Several of my favorite Brunellos were represented, but others (out of a total of?150 Brunello producers) were not. I loved the Brunello from Tenuta Silvio Nardi, which is a wine that I buy and bring home when I'm in Tuscany. I stood for a few moments talking with the rep about the location and elevation of the vineyard, and he told me the winery is now being managed by Emilia Nardi, Silvio's daughter. Another of my favorites, Col D'Orcia, provided the highlight of the evening. Dressed in a waistcoat and sporting a salt-and-pepper moustache, the avuncular rep was very free with his pours. Moreover, he had a cavalcade of ancient vintages that he'd pull out from behind his sign if he liked you. He liked us. In quick succession, we tried the newly released '04 ("We usually like to let this age a little more," said the rep, with a twinkle in his eye.) an '03, and an '01 ("I remember that summer," I said, trying to impress him, "It was incredibly hot and there was no rain.") Finally, from under the table, he produced a 1.5 liter bottle of his regular Brunello '97, regarded by some as the best vintage of the previous century. He poured us generous tastes. The wine was magnificent, with a subdued garnet hue;?a nose of licorice, tobacco,?cherry, and the leather of a well-used whip wielded by a dominatrix; and a long groovy finish. As we exited the hall of Brunello, we encountered a table of Italian cheeses thronged with hungry swillers, who managed to toss pieces of cheese on the carpet and grind them in with their heels. A largish woman displaying a Grand Canyon of cleavage drunkenly leaned against the wall, then slid to a sitting position, as her companion admonished her for drinking too much Brunello. We gratefully exited the hotel into the cool night air.  The aftermath

I don't think it should be called Top chef anymore, because that isn't how they are picking who wins. I don't think the show is all that great anymore because all they are doing now is putting on people that don't cook great food, they put people on that hook up and they keep them on that is getting old fast. The only one that actually cooks decent is Stephen and Jamie. I think 1 of those 2 should win.

The Search for Kenyan Food in Jersey
AUTHOR:

POST:
A year ago the Voice ran a piece called "Kenyan Unrest, Jersey Style," a fascinating story about how Kenyan immigrants who identified with the opposition party, the Orange Democratic Movement, were streaming into a fairly obscure corner of Jersey City after a disputed election a?few months earlier turned violent. The story mentioned a local hangout called Mallory Coffee Shop.I tucked it away in my "To Visit" file, and just dredged it up again recently.  While the?Voice article mentioned?ugali and managu being available, the first a cornmeal mush and the second a stewed green, the properietor laughed when I asked for them.?"In about six months, we're going to make this into a real restaurant. You know, with hot plates and more tables." Then he directed me to the website publiceye.com/jambo to watch for developments. Don't bother,?the site doesn't?work.  I had a cup of coffee and the order of?mandazi ($1) pictured above -- a sweet fritter that's a common form of street food in Nairobi. They were great, and I guess I'll have to go back in six months to see if an actual restaurant has materialized.?

Last April, the two ladies behind the counter (I took them for mother and daughter) were very friendly. I eventually got my ugali (bland, though with goat and kale, substantial), but first I got two smiles that might have been as broad as your proprietor's laugh. Judging by the ladies' facility with the microwave, theirs has never been a busy kitchen, at least not yet.

Here is the visual evidence of four wonderful meals at the new Thai restaurant Ayada, which focuses on the cusine of Bangkok, but tips its metaphorical hat to other regions of the country as well. ? From an extensive curry list, kang som sour curry comes with shrimp and swatches of vegetable omelet -- there are no other options. Thai fried rice is a wonderful meal unto itself. Don't worry -- there are plenty of Isaan dishes on the menu, including this scrumptious sour sausage. And the littlest diner -- Nadir ?

Strange Snacks of the World -- Cracker Nuts
AUTHOR:
Robert Sietsema
DATE:
2009-01-27 19:17:00
POST:
I stumbled on these tandem products--manufactured by Food Industries, Inc. in Manila under the Nagarya label--in a Philippine grocery on West Side Avenue in Jersey City, on a stretch south of Communipaw Avenue that contains perhaps a dozen Filipino restaurants, some of them quite good. The product consists of a peanut coated in wheat-flour dough and deep fried. In the adobo version, the crunchy coating is pale and slightly spicy, named after a vinegary stew that, known as chicken adobo, constitutes the national dish of the Philippines. The original recipe came from Mexico, through which the Philippine colony was administered in the era of Spanish colonialism. Needless to say, the Filipinos have adapted it extensively, adding vinegar and soy sauce, among other things. The garlic flavor tastes a little sweeter, and is very garlicky, with a slight afterburn. An entire bag of either weighs in at 900 colories, but then this isn't supposed to be diet food.  Above, a garlic cracker nut shown whole and in cross section. Below, the adobo version, intact and exloded. photo credit: Fork in the Road?Institute for the Study of Snack Foods

This is such a reach to discredit Mr. Limbaugh that it is funny. I was also subjected to jello experiments in my childhood by my Loving Mother. I am not embarassed by this fact, nor do I have any less Love for my Mother. I am proud of my roots and the political foundation that I received in middle class America, eating jello. This demonstraits that the drive by media, can't debate the issues head on, they need to discredit you in any way possible. Keep fighting for our constitution Mr. Limbaugh!!

Here's the thing. Rush is a public figure. He has made himself one by his own choice. He has attacked people and their families plenty in the past. This very mild post simply points out the digusting sounding recipe created by his Mom. To take it this much to heart goes to show how on their heels the right really are. Please calm yourself and as Rush himself always says--stop being offended.

ahem, you're right about everything except that the recipe is Limabugh's grandmothers. The Crap guy ran another blog correcting this a while ago. That one also has hilarious comments from dittohead dimwits. the funniest thing about all this hasn't been the Under the Sea Salad, which is really funny on its own. It's been seeing how these people take such great offense at the lightest of all slights! And how they don't even try to defend the Viagra in the Dominacan charges from the orignal post!

You guys still here? Can someone explain what in the hell this Jell-O story has to do with liberals taking away people's personal freedoms? If anything, it just tells us if you go to a liberal's house you're probably going to get a better dinner!

At first I was angry about rush's salary until I realized why: Rush is a Nazi and his only "beer hall" of operation is owned by jewish landlords. They can shut him down and throughly silence him any time he strains his leash. Yeah, It costs a bundle but It sure does work. Come on ditto heads, see if you can get him on an antisemitic tirad now, then listen to the silence.

Liberals keeps attacking Rush for abusing drugs even though he had severe pain, but notice the liberal drive bys don't bring up the fact that our president, barack hussein obama has delved in drugs purely for recreation. And...he can't stop his nicotine ADDICTION which is also a drug. A little unfairness going on here? Liberals cannot see the forest for the trees!!! Elizabeth

Sarah DiGregorio reminds me of man-hater feminazis' who never bothered to learn to cook themselves since that would be denegrating to women "of power" everywhere. Perhaps Mz. DiGregorio has a fine recipe passed down from her grandmother, something along the lines of "Che Guevara murdered-innocents topped with burned bra." She of the morning-after pill popping and nonsensical man-hater tirades.

When Rush was busted for sending his housekeeper out to buy drugs illegally. He said there out to get me. When Rush was busted for coming back from the Domincan Republic, with Viagra prescribed to someone else he said there out to get me. Donovan McNabb is quarterback and Obama, is President just because they are Black. According to Rush. Maybe there out to get him. 3 failed marriages, and no children. Maybe the wives were out to get him. Rush failed to stop McCain from being nominated. Maybe the Republican voters were out to get him. Rush failed to stop Obama fron being elected. Maybe voter were out to get him. Limbaugh's contract is bleeding Clear Channel dry. Revenues are down and Clear Channel is laying off 1850 employees. Those employess have a lot more to complain about than Limbaugh.

Rush listeners: please keep listening so that he can take the far right-wingers with no sense of reality and who can't think for themselves off a cliff and make room for a more moderate 3rd party that can actually get something done. He's only pumping you full of what you hear but all of his positions are politically untenable. Why do you think he won't run for office? Other than greed (he said himself he won't take the pay cut; a fine excuse) he'd get trounced when he isn't in his glass bubble with call screeners and a hang up button to silence dissent.

Rush Limbaugh on the radio is the Third to carry that name. His father was Rush H. Limbaugh Jr. So, this was a book written by Rush's Grandfather -- who, by the way, just had a federal courthouse named after him. But, no need to fact check or anything. It's just an excuse to get in some cheap digs. This is a great publication! I guess that's why it's given away for free.

I'm from Cape Girardeau and I know Rush and his family. They are a great family and I am proud of Rush for going after Hussein. He deserves it. It's funny that they called Bush every name possible and we were suppose to deal with it but now the baby democrats can't handle the same kind of treatment that Bush got.

During his coverage of inauguration day, Rush's commentary consisted mostly of breathing loudly into the Golden EIB microphone. This was eerily similar to Darth Vader's evil schtick. His final comment on the proceedings was, "An empty drum makes the most noise." He meant it for Obama, but it was clear that it was a better description of his own Bozo the Clown- W.C. Fields- P. T. Barnum self. Still, I must admit that as a left leaning moderate masochist, I have an irresistable compulsion to listen to him for 3 or 4 hours a day. He must be eating as many cigars as he smokes.

Rush defenders claim this light-hearted article constitutes an attack from the Left as if all liberals conspired to write this unimportant, but amusing, article. If this is truly an attack worth rebutting, then Rush defenders must feel pretty vulnerable. Not admitting to vulnerablity, Rush defenders then claim the entire liberal cause is weak and baseless just this article happens to be trivial. Silly Dittoheads.

POST:
 You know how to make a slider, don't you? You just make the hamburger smaller, plop it on the griddle or in the non-stick skillet, and cook it not quite as long. Voila! Now along comes an appliance that makes slider-making less of a "chore." The Big City Slider Station allows you to buy into the slider craze, creating your own sliders as your?friends look on in amazement. Like all internet offers, it comes with a blizzard of strange accoutrements, including a "lid" that you're supposed to put on top of the sizzling burgers, cutting the cooking time down to two minutes, according to the blurb. Of course this results in steamed rather that fried burgers, but if you bought this piece of shit you don't care. The detached hand is also shown pushing down on the sliders, which will evacuate all the tasty juices, leaving your slider dry as the desert. And, as if your life wasn't already easy enough, there's a clamp that assists you in forming the patties prior to steaming them to death. Enjoy your gray crumbly sliders, consumers! And, to make space in your tiny kitchen, throw out the food processor and clear a nice niche on your shelves for the Big City Slider Station! ? ? Related Content Related Stories...

The Early Word -- Cataldo's
AUTHOR:

POST:
The margherita pie at Cataldo's (click to enlarge) Cataldo's--a new Italian restaurant at Vanderbilt and Dean on the fringes of Prospect Heights--is hard to figure out. It's so brightly lit, that it shines like a beacon to cars zooming by on Atalntic Avenue one block away. While this may be good for advertising purposes, by the time you enter and sit down, you feel like you're in an operating room. An oven decorated with all sorts of quarried stone products is the centerpiece of the open kitchen, which sits at the far end of the dining room. A quick glance indicates that it's burning hardwood. So this is partly a Naples-pie type place, selling only individual boutiquey pies in a Motorino vein. Fair enough. But there's also a long steam table filled with pastas cooked well past al dente, and the sort of accessory dishes that a Sicilian cafe in Dyker Heights or Bensonhurst might vend. Indeed, the list of pastas is completely predictable, running from lasagne to fettuccine alfredo to penne alla vodka. Then there are the boneless veal, chicken, and fish entrees that, with the pastas, comprise the menu of most Brooklyn Italian-American restaurants. In other words, this is an old-style Italian joint in a very unusual place with a woodburning pizza oven grafted on. The only place I can compare it to is the excellent La Villa in Park Slope. The margherita pizza pictured above was nevertheless quite good, with a crust that seemed only a little bit too stiff, and cheese that, while fine, was clearly not the fiore di latte (fresh mozzarella) favored by the best Naples pie places in town (and by Totonno's, for that matter). The lasagne was perfect of its type, cut from a big square on the steam table, smashed down by the attendant, heaped with extra ground meat and cheese, and then zapped in the microwave. We loved it and unavoidably ate every morsel. Another high point of the meal was the odd-ball fried calamari sandwich, an obscure bit of Scilian soul food I've only seen once before -- at Catene Deli in the south Slope near the 4th Avenue F station. It was totally scrumptious, as you can see from the picture below. 554 Vanderbilt Avenue, Prospect Heights, Brooklyn, 718-857-6700 Related Content Related Stories...

My friends & I stopped in at Cataldo's Restaurant the other night. It was great! The staff is eager to please and the food is excellent. There is a great variety in their menu of good old-fashioned Italian staples such as linguine with white clam sauce, chicken parmigiana, and veal pizzaiola as well as many others. We shared the Quattro Stagioni pizza with fresh mozzarella as a starter and it was out of this world. I totally recommend this place! It's great for both dining in & taking out. Can't wait to make my way back there again.

Frozen Yogurt on a Frozen Evening

POST:
It's 21 degrees outside, one of the coldest evenings of the?year, and a frigid wind is whipping up Bleecker Street, scattering trash and making black plastic bags fly through the air like witches. Oh! City of wonders:?There in the window of Pinkberry's late this Sunday evening sits a trio of friends, and they're wolfing down the frozen yogurt. Maybe they're like takers of homeopathic medicines, irritating their bowels with cold yogurt to gird themselves for the even-colder outdoors. But what strikes me as I tack back and forth in the fierce wind, is how happy Edward Hopper would have been?painting this bleak winter apparition.

"Drunken Negro Face" Cookie Post-Mortem

POST:
? Nobody in the neighborhood seemed to notice, and the nannies continued to sweep into the bakery for cookies and milk with?their young charges, just picked up from Greenwich Village's P.S. 41 next door. But Lafayette Bakery--which has rather grandly?called itself a "French Bakery" for nearly?75 years, even though the owners are Greek--was the center of a shit storm on the internet, when Gothamist, Fox 5 News, NBC, and Fork in the Road, among a dozen?other websites,?reported that a racist "Drunken Negro Cookie" was being sold in honor dishonor of Obama's inauguration. While you might have expected a demonstration, picket line, or even brick-through-the-window, nothing happened, and nobody seemed to be boycotting or leafleting as I passed and re-passed the place on my bike during the day. Clearly, this is not the same neighborhood where activism was once the norm.?In fact, the original home of the Village Voice is on the same block, and the Stonewall Bar, birthplace of the Gay Rights movement, is right around the corner. No, this is now mainly a white-glove neighborhood, where the civil rights implications of a cookie are not a primary concern. Or maybe nobody who propels up and down Greenwich Avenue has much interest in an internet brouhaha. The owners have always seemed a little dim, anyway, and the pastries and cookies are so below par that I can only remember stopping there once or twice in the last decade. But one can't help thinking, What if the cookie had borne an anti-gay message??Then?there might have been trouble. BTW--the cookie has been removed from the display cases.

THis is why many blacks, latinos, etc. are not hearing the "gay right to marry" message. The main people pushing that issue are white men and women. They will not step up with the same fervor when it's discrimination against something that does not effect gay rights. I'm not for gay marriage, but definitely promote gay rights otherwise. Call it wrong, but hopefully you'll see my point is not to discriminate gays, but speak against hate crimes on "everyone". This is why many black gays move to the ATlanta area. There is so much prejudice in the gay community in San Fran and NY. I remember taking a class at UC Berkeley speaking about this. There are documentaries out there describing the racial prejudices experience by black gay men. Overall, this bakery needs to be shut down or burned down.

Wow! This is shocking that someone would even take the time out to make "drunken nigger cookies." It's a shame that he sat in his bakery and thought "Hmm... Let me make a cookie to offend black people and I shall call it the drunken nigger cookie!" He is freaking pathetic. Someone should've throw a brick though his window and then burned that shit to the ground. Greek bastard. Besides the cookie we have an African/White president. So, even though ppl want to continue to be racist Obama is in the White House & he isn't going anywhere. I should make a drunken whitey cookie out of a saltine cracker and red skittles for eyes. I wonder who would buy those. Haha, just kidding.

Of course, it's tasteless and offensive. The baker claims ignorance if the offensive and racist nature of this cookie- he doesn't understand why he has 100 messages including cursing out and threats of bodily harm. Many people are plain old angry that this Black man became president. This baker is simply trying to capitalize on that anger, and this won't be the last act of hatred directed at our president because he is Black.

Ya so I figured, whatever or so, no big deal. I think the baker messed up, he should of just said they where choclate cookies they look like people, he could have made some white chocolate ones too.

I would like to add to the comment a topic for one to think about prior to commenting on this subject. If we allow a person to stir up this much commotion then we are feeding into the behavior if the behavior consist of such. However, if we learn to respect one another regardless of their behavior or beliefs then we gradually help in making positive changes for the greater good. In honor of Dr. Martin Luther King we should at least model what he believed to be one day a dream!

Those of us living in NYC who posses a balanced measure of intelligence & character shouldn't be shocked that this kind of thing is still happening in our city/country. The present state our country has a lot of people upset, and many are looking to vent their negativity/issues anyway they can. It's obvious that the store baker, the store owners, and all who would support this kind of behavior are having a Shit-Head moment. They have shown us their substance as human beings, now let us move on. After all, nothing from nothing, is nothing.

It would say something like, "Be in your apartment from noon till 4 pm today, when an inspector from the city will arrive to inspect your gas pipes," or "the plumbers will be here tomorrow, so be prepared to let them in your apartment between the hours of 8 am and 2 pm," or "The super needs to get in your apartment on Friday," with no explanation why, but with the subject line on the memo reading "Re: Gas Shut-Off." The utter randomness of these notices was appalling, since they implied no sequence in which events relating to the restoration of service had to occur. Even more appalling was the fact that the visits predicted in the strident notices almost never occurred. Not that some progress wasn't being made. During the third week of gas shutoff, for example, a couple of guys in dungarees had knocked, then slouched in the doorway as they told me in thick Slavic accents that they needed to do something with the gas meter. As I stood watching, they removed the gas meter from the wall, unhooking it from its telescoping pipes. They set the massive meter in the middle of my kitchen floor, surrounded by its attaching hardware. And then left. Forever. By the sixth week of gas cessation, there were some positive signs that someday the gas might be reconnected. There was a flurry of white memos, boasting of diverse events about to occur. There was a pattering of feet on the stairway several times a day that I could hear from my perch in the living room, almost like mice running around inside the walls. The apartment where the actual gas leak had occurred was being worked on, that's for sure, and one day a guy sat in front of the building on a shitload of copper pipes. I assume they were destined to be installed in the vertical line of apartments that had suffered the gas leak. But did they have to replace the gas pipes in all the lines of apartments, including mine? This had been threatened as a "worse case" scenario. And were there other flaws as yet undiscovered in various other gas pipes that ran through the building like purse snatchers? One day a very short stranger presented himself at the apartment door looking just like Luigi in Mario Bros., green cap and all. He seemed to be a deaf mute, because he didn't say a word, but slid past me, went into the kitchen, hoisted the heavy gas meter with incredible strength, and re-affixed it, almost without using any tools. (OK, he whisked a small spanning wrench out of his pocket, and with a few quick twists, put the meter back in place.) Two days later, without ceremony, a couple of guys claiming to be from Con Ed, but not wearing any uniforms, marched into my apartment at 3:25 in the afternoon. It was a cold sunny day outside with a temperature of 18 degrees, but they had no coats. The pair first turned on all the burners on the stove to the self-lighting position, so there was a staccato click-click-clicking that sounded like a percussion symphony. This went on for five minutes. I was cowering in the living room. I began to feel a wave of heat emanating from the kitchen. I went into the kitchen and the guys had mysteriously disappeared. The kitchen window was open. Had they jumped into the air shaft? But then my attention was drawn to my tiny tenement stove. All four burners were burning! Flames were shooting skyward at a pressure I'd never experienced before. It was like a beautiful monumental sculpture. A tribute to all the fallen cooks who had gone before me, with four eternal flames. The oven was on, too, going full blast. But why had they left everything burning and disappeared. Had they been real people, or had I just experienced a miracle? Not missing a beat, I ran to my computer and began inviting friends for a celebratory dinner the next day. I was going to celebrate my gaseous liberation by slow-cooking a beef brisket all day, Texas style. I invited a half-dozen friends, and the next morning went to the Western Beef in Chelsea. I picked the fattiest brisket I could find--weighing in at 12.81 pounds and costing $30.62. Not wanting to have leftover brisket for the rest of my life, I cut the meat in half, and put the balance in the freezer for later (maybe to make a corned beef). I rubbed the half brisket all over with an even mixture of kosher salt, freshly ground black pepper, and mild red chile powder (you can substitute paprika) a friend sent me from Hatch, New Mexico. Then I popped the thing in the oven for ten hours at 200 degrees. And here was the result, a fit accolade to my newly operational stove: Related Content Related Stories...

Just because it is legally protected doesn't mean that it is not wrong. Free speech can still be crass, ignorant, and wrong. Furthermore, there is nothing wrong with boycotting a business that propagates political views with which you do not agree. My guess is that he will deeply regret this tasteless act when he loses most of his business.

Any asshole on here trying to make sense of if he would have made any cookie with any race is racist as well. White, black, Asain, Hispanic etc. , its all wrong. And the asshole giving satistics, do your research, he made this cookie in "honor" of our president who does not have a history of acholism. He did not make the cookie based on African American people having a higher rate of acholism. If he made any cookie reguarding race even if it were not mine I am just as offended because it is so sad.

CL is an idiot. Blacks have a higher rate of alcoholism than Blacks? Where do you get your facts? That's just NOT true. It's people like you that just blame liberals (instead of taking personal responsibility) that RUINED the Republican party and cost us not only the election but the direction of our party. We used to be about family values, about ending costly wars expanded by DEMOCRATS, preserving personalized accountable small government and about keeping our country out of the hands of snakes. Instead we elect a liar, GWB...and we make excuses for racism, and protect crooks. Instead of persecuting faithful Christians like the majority of hardworking immigrants are, and teenagers getting abortions, we should go after the banking industry and these companies that ship every aspect of our infrastructure overseas. We should give our veterans better benefits. I went independent in 2008. because I can't even all myself a Republican anymore because what I thought a Republican was is not that anymore. These cookies are symbolic of idiocy and of a outdated 19th century mentality. "Liberals did this, Liberals...Liberals, Shut up and take responsibility for your own actions." Grow up America.

If this guy had played his cards right, he could have gotten a position in the Civil Rights Division of the Bush Dept of Justice, under the racist Schlotzman who was hired to dismantle the civil rights protections afforded by the federal government. Or in Immigration and Customs Enforcement of Julie Myers, who thinks that it is supremely funny to wear blackface and a prison outfit to a Halloween party for an agency that incarcerates hundreds of people, many black. The Bush administration was unabashedly and proudly racist and used it politically. They always apologize later - this guy might rethink his bigoted perception, but Julie Myers was part of a racist cabal in the Bush admin, and Schlotzman was a major player in a systematic racist effort at the highest levels of the DOJ. They are the ones who deserve the attention. This poor schmuck is just a dumbass.

I agree that the store should be boycotted. While I do agree that he has the freedom of speech to make those horrid cookies, don't we also have the freedom of speech to say that we should boycott the store? We can only control the actions that we ourselves do, so I think that he should hold himself accountable for his racism. Besides... it's not just the cookies- he made a veiled threat against Obama's life! That in itself would be enough to make me want to boycott his store. I don't support racism and I sure as heck don't support violence!

This cookie wasn't created because Obama destroyed the country. It was done solely as a degradation of Obama's race. DON'T PRETEND YOU DON'T KNOW THE DIFFERENCE. Bush is loathed for his actions, not race. Why do you people insist on being so stupid?

Wow! Ted K. is insane. Only a fool would jeopardize his business and livelihood over ignorance. Only a fool! However, it is quite interesting to me that he would openly state that our newly elected president is "following in the footsteps of Lincoln", and he (Ted Kafelino) continues to walk as a free man. I thought that the slightest hint of threatening a President's life resulted in immediate incarceration. Didn't he break the law using his freedom of speech by making a subtle threat? This guy is not joking, he is Angry! Finally, for all of you who will continue to frequent this pastry shop because you believe this act is reflective of his sense of humor... Buyer beware! As a blogger stated above, this guy likes putting "jokes" into his baking. Wonder what he is mixing up next -- Rub"nuts" Rum Cake or maybe a special "Pee nut Butt er Cookie"! Maybe these treats will have the same flavor! ;-)

"he is allowed to do this its called freedom of speech and its his political view." You're absolutely right -- he is allowed to do this. But along with that right, he has the RESPONSIBILITY to accept whatever consequences happen if he expresses his view. "if he thinks this of obama you can not do anything about it" Actually, yes, there is something we can do about it. We can decide, "if this man thinks this way about African-American people, I don't think I'll shop there. Because I don't want to give my money to bigoted people." And that's exactly what's going to happen. The owner had the right to say what he did, but he also has the responsibility to accept the lost business that will come as a consequence. Because that's what a boycott IS.

Is this supposed to be a joke to make people laugh or what? I don't get it. Also, was there a Drunken White cookie to honor Bush? If so, that too, would have been disrepectful. Especially in light of the whispers about his drinking problem! Never heard anything about Obama and alcohol! Creating this cookie was just plain ignorant!

Again, for those of you who missed this little sentence: "He also apparently suggested to a customer that Obama will "get what's coming to him" just like President Lincoln." He was making veiled threats of assasination against the President. Even if he was just speaking out of his butt (which he undoubtedly was) & wouldn't attempt to assasinate anyone, he was vocally supporting anyone who would attempt to murder the President. That is never acceptable, whether he's talking about the President, a normal person, a black person or a white person. Violence is never acceptable.

In a world that sometimes seems to be changing too fast to keep up with, one thing remains constant, and that is the unfortunate tendency of our friends on the Far Right to flaunt their stupidity at every opportunity. Not to mention their dishonesty, since, contrary to Mike's claim, it's conservative Christians, not liberals, who are generally the first to scream "boycott" whenever their "delicate sensibilities" are offended. Personally, I don't support boycotts for the simple reason that more often than not, they amount to little more than free publicity for the offender. For every one person who refuses to patronize this racist moron's business, there are two who'll go out of their way to give him their money and support. I'm not saying it isn't worth a shot, but there's always the chance it'll end up having the opposite of the intended effect. Better to let things take their own course. Now that the word is out, this idiot is going to lose plenty of business without the need for any organized effort.

 Friday is the best day of the week because that's the day the legendary Sikorski Meat Market throws its freshly smoked charcuterie onto the counter while it's still warm. All from the pig, of course, but you can select short ribs, spare ribs, loin, and sometimes other swine-bearing treats. Only a couple of dollars for a couple of ribs--I don't remember how much exactly, because the receipt became so clotted with grease, that I couldn't think of sticking it into my wallet. 603 Manhattan Avenue, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, 718-389-6181 ?

Market Watch -- Newfangled Matzohs
AUTHOR:
Robert Sietsema
DATE:
2009-01-22 14:22:00
POST:
 What looks like a craggy rock found in the desert is the new matzoh offered at Blue Ribbon Bakery Market?($1.25). It's not kosher for passover, that's for sure, but it sure is good, dusted with herbs and way salty, so salty you wouldn't want to eat it with cheese. Nevertheless, it makes a fine snack, and looks a lot more like the matzohs produced according to Jewish law by the Satmar bakeries under the J tracks on Brooklyn's Broadway than those bland square crackers produced by Streit's. Of course, those go much better with cheese or peanut butter...14 Bedford Street, 212-647-0408

Carla has clearly been outclassed since episode 1. It amazes me how she manages to skate by each week. Her lack of experience, ramblings and self-serving banter are an irritant. I feel several very deserving people have been sent packing while she continues to enjoy challenge after challenge.

The Early Word -- Woodburning Pit

POST:
 Best Dish: Pork rib I've made no secret of my enthusiasm for the Portuguese neighborhood barbecues of Newark's Ironbound, corner bars that hand-rotisserie massive racks of ribs and whole splayed chickens with pirir-piri sauce over lump charcoal. Now Bay Ridge has its own Portuguese barbecue (known as a churrasqueira, not a churrascaria--that's Brazilian), The Woodburning Pit. The name constitutes something of a misnomer, since the open pit in the middle of the dining room uses charcoal briquettes instead of hardwood or lump charcoal, but the pitmaster?deploys the same sort of contraption, which must be turned by hand, to cook the meat at high temperature with plenty of smoke. Served with a double-carbo charge of good fries and good dirty rice, the pork ribs rule at the Pit. And the tariff of $14 for a full rack, $8 for a half-rack, is a great dining deal. While tender as all get-out, the chicken isn't quite as good--it's been rubbed with something that tastes like ketchup with a little hot sauce mixed in, which prevents the skin from crispening, and does nothing for the flavor of the bird. Soups are a little disappointing, and not because they start out with a Norr-type soup stock (that's standard in Portugual and throughout much of Europe). The caldo verde was low on shredded collard greens and sausage, preventing it from becoming the kind of rib-sticker that Portuguese depend on, and the chicken soup weren't too good, either. Still, as a barbecue with reasonable prices, The Woodburning Pit excels, and I'll be returning for the ribs, hamburgers, and egg-topped steak. 6715 Fifth Avenue, Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, 718-630-9980  We were not impressed by the caldo verde

Bourdain's right as usual. Bittman and Batali should be locked in a room without food and water and see how long it takes for them to eat each other's flesh. (I have a special dislike for Batali for having turned cucina italiana into overpriced yuppie fare.)And Paltrow, ugh, what a pill. She should be smacked across her smug kisser with a nice big jamon.

Right or wrong, to say that Bourdain is not contrived is a laugh. Sure, I'm sick of AW too, but Bourdain's insults -- even his praise for certain people -- are all schtick, and it's tiring.

Yeah, I know, I thought that at first too. But I saw them put the whole shebang on the tacos for everyone who walked in, regardless of race. And, it's funny, when I first moved here from LA, I stopped at a random taco place in Sunset Park (don't even remember what it was called now), ordered a taco and was horrified when it came with lettuce and queso fresco. But now I think it's just a different, less-known style that takes getting used to. At Los Hermanos, if you get the taquitos (not fried, just on a smaller tortilla, smaller portion of meat), they don't put the lettuce-tomato on those. So that might be your best bet!

Hi Bill, Well, it's funny--that's how they serve them at Los Hermanos, with no prompting. I used to live in LA, so I'm more accustomed to what I think is the classic topping: just cilantro and chopped white onion. But I emailed Robb Walsh, the well-known food writer down in Houston, wondering if the lettuce-tomato topping was more of a central Mexican style that I had simply not experienced. He said that, in his taco truck travels in Houston and closer to the border, he often sees the lettuce-tomato-crema combo. So I'm guessing that it's a regional thing, and although I can appreciate it, I do prefer my tacos with just cilantro/onion.

I always figured they put the lettuce, tomato and crema on for the white folks, figuring that's how they *think* we want it.

In my experience, rural Pueblans put only cilantro and chopped onions on their tacos. I think the lettuce/tomato/cheese or crema thing is an urban phenomenon, and maybe even a Tex-Mex one that has crossed back over into Mexico.

Market Watch -- Chinese Celery
AUTHOR:

POST:
Chinatown vegetable markets are bursting with celery, but it's not just any kind of celery. Chinese celery (Apium graveolens) has slenderer stalks than its Occidental counterpart; the leaves are bigger and more prominent, and the whole plant is ten times more pungent. Thus it is a vegetable with lots more potential than just something to dip in the blue cheese dressing after you eat your Buffalo wing. I like it chopped up fine in a salad dressing, or floating in a soup for extra zing. You can get an entire bunch of Chinese celery, consisting of about five plants with 30 or so stalks, for $1 at most Chinatown markets. Try thowing some in mom's chicken soup, or using it in homemade Chinese dumplings. Or chop it up in tuna salad. Or top a salad with the leaves. You may never go back to regular celery again.

Incredibly Cheap Eats -- Dumplings

 The name on the sign is Dumplings; the name on the menu is Chinese Food Dumplings is perhaps the ninth dumpling cafe to open in Manhattan's Chinatown, and it's certainly one of the best. As usual, the prices are a step below rock bottom. A friend and I enjoyed a $5 lunch (that's for both of us!) that included four fried pork-and-chive dumplings, a bowl of sweet-and-sour soup heavy on the cloud ear 'shrooms and bamboo shoots, a bowl of wonton soup graced with eight steamed dumplings, and a complimentary plate of the establishment's homemade northern-Chinese kim chee, which contained apples, was quite spicy, and glowed?a?flourescent shade of orangey-pink. The menu also offers bowls of lamb soup for $3,50, and something called "Shanhai shepherd's parse & pork wonton soup." And I thought only my third grade teacher could parse! 25B Henry Street, 212-608-8962  Clockwise from upper left (click to enlarge): Homemade kim chee, sweet-and-sour soup, wonton soup, fried dumplings

An unemployed friend reports that she stumbled on the perfect foodie job, and can't believe it hasn't already been filled. Here is the job description (the typos are all theirs): We don't like the sound of "placing carbonic acid soak pad over hive" part, but what the hell? They also don't mention that you get to wear that weird white suit and the spaceman hood, which might be a deterrent to a claustrophobe. But the inevitable drawback appears later in the Job Summary, in the synopsis part: a limited potential pay range of $9.70 to $9.70 an hour.

The Name Game

POST:
Like us, you're probably really tired of the boring names lately conferred on Manhattan's food producing establishments. It also seems like all the good names have been taken, as we witness places being named with such faceless monikers as Co., Earth,?and Delicatessen, or?totally cringeworthy names like Sweetiepie. But a recent trip to Sunset Park and Bay Ridge revealed a whole new class of establishments that boldly confer memorable names upon themselves. Here are a couple of night-photographed examples, after the jump. In the shadow of the Belt Parkway is the invitingly named Last Stop Fresh Meat. Doesn't it make your mouth water? As much a state of mind as a collection of mercantile objects, we give you-- Hookahnuts. Or maybe it describes a malady of the testicles--characterized by pain and extreme distension--after smoking too much hash!

Of course, there's no such person as Hannah Montana--it's Miley Cyrus in the character of Hannah Montana, as everyone knows. I guess the idea is that, while enjoying the candy, purchasers can have something like an onstage rock-star fantasy, since the gummies come in only two shapes--guitar and microphone. Before we taste it, let's look at some other aspects of this candy. Above the designation "Concert Candy," it says "Artificially Flavored." What a relief! I was worried that they'd taste like microphones and guitars! The candy is "Individually Wrapped for Portion Control," which means you can use it to torture your kids, by meting out only one gummy at a time. That's not much torture potential, however, since there are only six gummies--weighing 2.5 ounces--in the entire $1.19 bag. (OK, I'll do the math: that's $7.62 per pound, or a tad less than 20 cents per gummy.) On the back of the bag, it also says Made In China, by which they probably mean there might be some melamine in there, too. It's impossible to tell what the flavors are, even after you've eaten the gummies. The guitar is a sad excuse for a guitar; I think it was modeled on a Fender Strat, even though the horns have collapsed onto the body. More interesting, perhaps, considering Miley's penchant for semi-nude modeling, is the microphone. It has a big pink head that tapers toward the base. To the touch, the feel is moist and clammy. Man this baby is lubed! The taste is somewhere between generic mixed citrus and cardboard. Still, as a conversation piece or sociological study, you can't beat these gummies. And I delight to think the hand of Disney is in there somewhere. Just don't give them to your kids.

POST:
 Chapter 5: Timing is Everything I had assumed that the gas shut-off would continue for a few days. Boy, was I ever wrong! Days gradually turned into weeks, and then I found myself at the one-month anniversary of the gas leak. I began to be paranoid. A friend who was a corporate chef called to remind me that the gas in his East Village co-op had remained shut off for seven years, making the place impossible to sell, since it could garner no Certificate of Occupancy in the gas-less condition. About the same time, an article appeared in New York magazine telling how, when the gas is shut-off, the intricate ballet of Con Ed employees, housing department inspectors, and repairmen (so far, no repairwomen), can take months to complete. But did I freak out? No, I hunkered down. I began to crave the popping and clicking of the hot plate first thing in the morning, signaling the start of my morning tea. I routed the white cord so that it didn't sprawl over the counter, making the hot plate more attractive. I even tried to clean the little bugger, though the snake-like element barely lifted off its shiny aluminum splash-plate, and the shininess was soon a thing of the past. Anyone who cooks with electricity soon learns to almost savor the smell of the random splatter on the heating element, leading to a wisp of white smoke like the one when a pope is finally elected. The smell is a pungent merging of cold nasal electricity and charred food.  I continued cooking my one-pot meals, but they became more elaborate. I bought a chicken, and made a broth out of the neck, wings, and back, and set it aside. Next, I browned the cut-up chicken in my non-stick skillet. Then I poured the broth over the chicken, and added rice. I covered the skillet and cooked it for 30 minutes--and I had the Spanish classic arroz con pollo. At the last minute I stirred some Spanish chick peas from D'Espana into the rice, which gave it a creamier texture. I learned to create culinary elisions, grafting hash browns onto scrambled eggs for a one-dish breakfast as follows: Fry local Long Island potatoes Add free-range eggs from Hoosick Falls, NY Garnish with cucumber slices--Voila! Gradually, one-pot meals turned into more elaborate presentations. If I wanted to make a Thai stir-fry, for example, I'd cook the rice first, knowing that if you let the rice sit covered after it cooks, it becomes plumper and absorbs the excess moisture. When the stir-fry is done, the rice is at the proper temperature and moistness for serving. If I wanted a haricot vert side dish, I salted and steamed the beans first, then arranged them on the serving platter. Just before serving at room temperature, I drizzled on some EVOL, as Rachel Ray would say. I learned that, in cooking as in life, timing is everything, and I was soon making meals nearly as elaborate as when I had my four-burner stove. Next: The Conclusion

Strange Snacks of the World -- Duck lower jaws

POST:
 I was hanging out in Flushing with my friend Francis Lam, who writes a weekly column for Gourmet.com. We'd been on the usual run to Golden Shopping Mall, Roosevelt Food Court, and the Peking duck window at Corner 28. We'd gotten a scallion pancake under the LIRR, and copped a lamb kebab ("with spice") from one of the Xinjiang carts. "I'm thirsty," said Francis, "I need some Vietnamese coffee." I naturally wanted some too, and we soon found ourselves standing in front of Pho Hoang, a businesslike place just across from the Flushing library on Kissena Boulevard. I scanned the snacks in the window as we stood outside, figuring out whether to go into that place or the place next door. Pho Hoang won, even though it looked as much like an ancient Cantonese coffee shop as a Vietnamese restaurant. "Wait a minute," I said, staring into the window, "What's that?" I was pointing at a tub full of bony complexes I couldn't identify. "That's the lower jaw of ducks, a popular snack," he replied. We went in and got our coffee, thick and sweet as it should be. I went outside and looked in the window again, and thought I saw the pig head winking at me. 41-01 Kissena Boulevard, Flushing, Queens, 718-762-6151

"...even though it looked as much like an ancient Cantonese coffee shop..." It does double as a coffee shop, and, along w/ Corner 28, Sunflower Delight and a few others, it is one of the few joints you'll find open at 6am. They serve up the usual suspects, buns, congee, coffees, noodles, but, as you note, they're likely to have one or two mystery items in the mix. I've come to dig the early morning Flushing scene - it's a great mix of graveyard shifters on the way home, stagglers, migrant workers and bleary-eyed insomniacs (yours truly) floating in the mist and dipping long greasy crullers into their porridge. A little bakery - I always forget the name - just down a tad from Oriental Express - sells an assortment of "chinese donuts." P.

? photos courtesy of Hungry Planet: What the World Eats by Peter Menzel This piece has been circulating on the internet for almost two months. In case you haven't see it, it represents a superb illustration of the uneven distribution of the world's food resources. It shows a series of familes from around the globe, posing behind a pile of food that constitutes their entire food consumption for a week. Wow! Many things can be discerned from the excellent posed photos. Germans sure drink a lot of bottled beverages. Americans like to eat delivered pizzas. Sicilians are fond of bread. Mexicans eat lots of luscious looking fruits and vegetables, but they wash them down with massive doses of Coke. Finally, the family from Chad will break your heart, eating a mere $1.23 worth of food in a week's time, as compared with over $500 for the German family. The originator of the comparison seems to be the website of the Canadian-based homelessnation.org.

 Does the debate over the authenticiy of ramen, and the finer points of the ramen philosophy,?leave you cold, or even strike you as?a bit twee? Are you tired of waiting in line to pay $20 for a bowl of noodles? Can you actually say you give a shit if a pig foot, in the southern Japanese style,?has passed through the noodle broth? (Or, alternately, do you prefer your glue in a jar on your desk instead of in your noodles?) If you can say yes to any of these burning questions, then Congratulations! You are ready for a cheap steaming bowl of udon, a noodle that I can guarantee the Japanese don't give a damn about. What's more, these noodles--which look like fat, limpid worms--don't come from China originally, but were invited?in Japan. How cool is that? As recently revealed in that indispensible guide for mid-island midday eaters, Midtown Lunch, a new branch of Udon West has opened east of Grand Central, in the same slapdash manner--the signs seem poorly affixed to the facade, a menu on a tarpaulin has been hung over the window--as the branch founded a year ago on St. Marks, which didn't even have?a phone number when it opened. The midtown branch is more commodious, with two rooms, a long counter, and a coat rack. Bowls of simiple noodles in a broth of no particular distinction run $7.50, but here's an economizing suggestion: Combinations of a bowl of noodles and another luncheon dish run $12.50, a humongous lunch that could be shared by two people. A bowl of katsudon, a bowl of udon, some yellow daikon pickles, and a heaplet of mountain vegetables--all for $12.50 Other delicious dishes that Japanese probably don't really care about, but are willing to eat on the run, include katsudon, chicken cutlet curry, salmon teriyaki, and shrimp tempura. Mix and match on a menu that never strays above $12.50, and the vigorous athletic cooks in their jaunty black caps provide a perfect floorshow. 150 East 46th Street, 212-922-9677 Related Content Related Stories...

Toby Young Admits to Brit Bias

POST:
America obviously has a penchant for British judges. I imagine so. None of the producers ever said to me, "We've been looking for a Brit." I've gotten a lot of [flack] from various American food critics since my debut last week including [from] Adam Platt -- the food critic of New York magazine -- and I dare say that they're all very cross that they weren't asked to appear as judges on "Top Chef." But, I think the reason why they asked a Brit is because we're much more outspoken and rude than our American counterparts. I imagine someone like Adam Platt would be very fair-minded, very judicious, and would spend several minutes advertising just how much he knew about each dish that was placed before him. And, as my old editor knows, that's very boring for people who just have a general interest in a subject.

"It looks like a scene from a Jimmy Buffett hangover. At the heart of the room, there's a diner-ish open kitchen packed with line cooks feverishly at work. It's tight quarters - for them, for the servers, and for customers trying to edge their way into the bathroom... the John Dory is the complete antithesis of Le Bernardin, the consummate and highly formal fish restaurant in midtown...The complete antithesis, that is, except for the quality of the cooking." -Danyelle Freeman, NY Daily News

Chopped: There Are No Top Chefs Here
AUTHOR:
Hailey Eber
DATE:
2009-01-14 13:00:00
POST:
Last night, onetime Bravo boy and sometimes Top Chef judge Ted Allen premiered his new? rival show on the Food Network, Chopped. Allen has spoken out against allegations that the show is a Top Chef rip-off, elucidating the differences on his blog, saying "There is no sleep deprivation, no "Big Brother" house full of bunk beds and cameras, no booze-fueled personal drama...Best of all, there is no product placement, so you never see passionate lovers of good food being forced to use packaged convenience junk thanks to Kraft/Altria/Exxon's sponsorship."That may all be true, but the absence of Diet-Dr.-Pepper Quickfires doesn't make up for the fact that Chopped's format is boring, the talent of its chef-testants subpar, and the general look of the show cheap. We'll take the occasional Bertolli challenge in exchange for some decent production value and an occasional change of scenery.? If there's any format Chopped has ripped-off, it's Iron Chef's. Each week, the four chef-testants have to cook an appetizer, main course, and dessert. They have 30 minutes to cook each course and must use the "mystery ingredients" provided for each course. Of course, instead of watching an Iron Chef like Mario Batali stun you with his genius use of yogurt, you're watching a Chopped contestant like Katie, a 21-year-old pastry chef, struggle to incorporate a strange vegetable known as "green onions" into her entree. From round-to-round, the chef preparing the worst dish is eliminated via a series of puns and catchphrases involving variations on the word "chop."One of the four mystery ingredients for the appetizer course is baby octopus, along with bok choy, smoked paprika, and oyster sauce. Only rock star turned chef, Perry, who works at Bar Blanc, thinks to throw his babies on the grill. The other chef-testants throw up their hands and toss their octopussies into boiling water with mixed results. At least chef-testant Sandy, an older caterer guy with a charming Southern accent, refers to them as "pulpos" in front of the judges, a move that impresses them and demonstrates the sort of culinary mastery only known to those who have ever eaten at a tapas restaurant. Chef Summer, a chef-testant who had hoped to show her vegetarian and vegan cooking skills rather than work with a tentacled-creature is the first to go. Big surprise.The judges themselves are a far less noteworthy and witty crew than Padma, Colicchio and Co. They're easily "wowed" by mediocre presentation, they're too civil, and they don't give us a clear idea of how they think a dish tastes. In the entree round, Chef Katie serves her duck breast with a surprise accompaniment of a cocoa crepe filled with ricotta. It appears to be a disastrous combination, but it could possess the weird brilliance of that wasabi-white-chocolate concoction that faux-hawked guy once did on Top Chef. Sadly, we never really get an idea of what the poultry + sorta cannoli dish tastes like. I found myself wishing for a Padma-esque declaration of like or dislike. Instead, we get that it's an "interesting" combination you wouldn't think of; apparently it tastes okay, as Katie passes to the next round. That's the problem with Chopped. It's all about "passable" cooking using not-that-weird "mystery ingredients." The chef-testants fumble and bumble when they have to work with baby octopus, or god forbid, green onions, and, at best, they make a presentable meal that surprises neither us nor the judges. There's little entertainment value in watching half-skilled pro-am (we're being generous with that designation) chefs attempt to cook a halfway decent meal under light constraints. If anything, it makes you appreciate the very aspects of Top Chef that Allen criticizes--the Big Brother living situation that at least provides opportunities to get out of the kitchen on occasion, and even the rampant sponsorship that while annoying also gives color and variety to the challenges. It's all too bad, because we like Allen, but we'd rather see him at the Top Chef judges' tabe than on this chopping block.

This song is fantastic. Neil's biting satire, tounge-in-cheek references to popular culture, and examination of the thought processes of the American 'everyman' are beautiful. Such a funny, relevant and poignant little song, with witty metaphor layered beneath a simplistic, rambling reflection on current events from the perspective of his truck driving character feels so wonderfully authentic. And the way he suggests the truck as a metaphor for America... I couldn't ask for more. Neil is one of the greatest, most important and inspiring musicians of this generation, the previous generation, and the one before that too! Great job, Neil. Keep 'em comin'.

My review this week is of a new Egyptian seafood spot in Bay Ridge, Asmak Taama, which brings the tally to three such places in the immediate vicinity. The best appetizer was an engaging?dish?of fried eggplant poached in tomato sauce with hot green chiles: Here are Butthole Surfers frontman?Gibby Haynes and bon vivant Scott "Scooter" Pellegrino enjoying the eggplant appetizer: We selected our sea bass from the display in the front window: And had it cooked over flame, after having been dusted with whole wheat flour and spices, and drenched in sea water: When fish are cooked by this Alexandrian method, you must pull off the blackened skin and discard it, revealing the smoky pink flesh beneath: We were a little disappointed by the "potato salad": But the dirty rice sprinkled with toasted pine nuts more than made up for it: Related Content Related Stories...

POST:
        I bought an early Beatles album released only in the UK (Beatles For Sale) and a Killers album missing from my collection (Hot Fuss), but then my eye fell on an oddity: an album with a relentlessly pink case entitled A Sense of Pork, ostensibly by a group called Disco Pigs.?What a gift, I thought, for my pork-obsessed friends (and I mean you, Winnie and Zak!).  A little research uncovered that the CD was the cast album for an obscure Off-Broadway play that had been transported from Cork, Ireland a decade ago. The play was about a pair of humans called Pig and Runt, and the dialog was in a sort of private language based on Irish slang, or so it says in the Variety review published at the time. I managed to listen to most of the CD, and there really wasn't very much about pork (the meat) in it, despite the title and the characters' names. Maybe the real meaning of the album is revealed by the title of the third cut: "Connemara Bong Song."

Best Markets -- El Quetzal
AUTHOR:
Robert Sietsema
DATE:
2009-01-13 9:09:00
POST:
 The quetzal is a tropical bird with colorful plumage and a long forked tail,?a national symbol of Guatemala. El Quetzal is also the name of a Guatemalen grocery in Jamaica, Queens, located on Hillside Avenue, under which the F train runs. The grocery is less than a block from the Parsons Ave. stop. It's?a classic New York City bodega, a dense warren of ethnographic products so super-organized that you'll find yourself walking hesitantly down the narrow aisle, fearful of knocking a thousand things off the wall with an inadvertent swipe of your arm. Following are some of the products we found there.   A plastic case near the front of the store sells Mexican-leaning pastries, many topped with colorful ridges of crumbles. One was an oblong roll shaped like a braided empanada. Cut it open and out spills a sweetened condensed milk filling that looks like--well, never mind!  Hung up on adhesive cards we?discovered?cheap mayo offered in plastic bags--an idea whose time has come?  There are bottled sauces galore. On the left is a sauce with the rather unfortunate name of Maya-ik, which tastes more sweet, salty, and sour than peppery. In the middle is Picamas, a cilantro-driven green chile sauce that's also suprisingly sweet. On the right is a sauce whose name translates "Church Sauce." It's like a species of Worcestershire, only--surprise!--sweeter. I think we can conclude that Guatemalans like lots of sugar in their table sauces.  Here are some English-style biscuits made with rice flour instead of wheat. Finally, we have an envelope of instant coffee with an engagingly retrograde picture of a blue enamel coffee pot. The envelope claims to make 6 to 8 cups, but seemed adequate for only a scant?2 cups by our tastes. Guatemalans?like their coffee on the weak side, with lots of milk and sugar, we presume. 160-06 Hillside Avenue, Jamaica, Queens, 718-759-8574?

Doubles Troubles
AUTHOR:
Robert Sietsema
DATE:
2009-01-12 15:34:00
POST:
A few months ago, I received a call on my Voice voicemail, informing me that A & A Bake and Doubles was relocating from Bed-Stuy to Richmond Hill, Queens. Now, A & A was one of my favorite eateries in Brooklyn, serving the doubles, bakes, and other Indian-leaning snacks that constitute the heart of Trinidadian cuisine. I dutifully filed the info away, considering Bed-Stuy's A & A closed for further snacking, and went to seek my doubles (a pair of tiny pooris with chick pea curry in between, with a choice of sauces that include tamarind and fiery scotch bonnet, called "pepper") elsewhere. Last week, I finally made it to the new A & A. Though the prices were a bit higher, the food was good, and some friends and?I tried a?doubles (the word is singular and plural) and an aloo pie--a potato fritter that I hadn't tried since I'd been in Trinidad. But when I posted a piece on the new A & A, Dave Cook of eatingintranslation.com?noted that the old place had never closed! Indeed, it was easy to miss this, since the old A &?A was notorious for keeping unpredictable hours, and would often close early in the afternoon if the doubles ran out. ? A & A's doubles (the Bed-Stuy version) pried open by eager hands So I hoofed it out to Bed-Stuy on Saturday, and re-acquainted myself with their wonderful Trinidadian food. The doubles were just as good as always--I had mine extensively squirted with "pepper," though my companions demured. What's more, they were only $1 apiece, as opposed to the $1.50 charged in Richmond Hill.  The magnificent herring bake We also tried the herring bake, a fried bread (a baked version is also available) stuffed with a flaky smoked herring salad. Wonderful! And very strongly flavored. When the kitchen door swung open at this standing-only eatery, I asked a guy that described himself as the manager if he knew anything about the new Richmond Hill location. "Never heard of it," he tersely replied. So, take this as a tip, that the original place is still open for business. 481 Nostrand Avenue, Brookly, 718-230-0753?  ?

The poster Richard is not branding you a "dimwit." He's simply pointing out that, instead of spreading rumor, sometimes it pays to act like a journalist and pick up a phone. No one's questioning your knowledge of immigration patterns, but in the food-blog world, rumors spread like wildfire. The more intriguing story is why there are two A+A Doubles. Is it competition? Someone aping the original?

Au contraire, my friend. Places moving from Brooklyn to Queens is a trend, though not one of epidemic proportions yet. A bit earlier Veggie Castle moved from Flatbush to the same stretch of Hillside, in line with a shift in the Guyanese and Trinidadian immigrant population to Queens, and not too long before that a couple of Manhattan Chinatown places moved to Flushing. Next time don't assume I'm a dimwit. It's bad commenting.

Did you read the piece? I said I received a call informing me that the place was "relocating." That word means closing and moving from one place to another. The guy was lying, but I accepted what he said as the truth. Yes, I might have driven over and inspected the old premises to make sure it was closed, but instead I went on visting the other 49,999 restaurants in the city. One year later I discovered that the old place was still open, and interviewed an employee, who claimed to have never heard of the new place, which I'd just visited. Yes, I could have done a muckraker on the imposter in Queens, and I suspect he once had a connection with the original place. How far do you want to go with this story? But then who would read it.

Hey Polecat -- The place on Hillside has a long steam table, with a few extra dishes, but it's nearly identical in its menu to the Nostrand place. I thought I detected a couple of extra dishes in Queens -- in particular, the "aloo pie" I'd had in Port of Spain -- but when I returned to Nostrand, they were also serving an aloo pie, which I hadn't remembered. In other words, I think the Nostrand place has expanded their menu slightly. It used to be mainly doubles and bakes, with a choice of a half-dozen fillings for the bakes. The Queens place, alas, is about 50 cents more expensive for every dish. Nice to hear from you. I enjoy your Chowhound posts.

If you haven't given them all away, you have to do the Tim Tam slam: bite the diagonal corners off one of the cookies, dip one bitten end in hot chocolate, and suck the liquid through the other (like a cookie straw). As soon as the hot chocolate hits your tongue, pop the whole cookie in your mouth for an. amazing. experience.

"Industry watchers"? "Analysts"? It's one guy. Truly pathetic of you to repeat one guy's prediction as something more than that. You obviously didn't read the actual piece, just the blog of the blog that mentions the piece. And this is why I haven't picked up a copy of The Voice in years (and it used to be a must-read).

Chocolate Crack

POST:
 A new paradigm in chocolate retailing is upon us, or should I say a new cult has infiltrated our ranks? Right before Christmas it moved into a large and long-vacant?West Village space at the corner of Bleecker and West 10th. Pure Dark was a store that vended only dark chocolate, often presented as a nugget or a bark. Stylish chocolate nibs figured in, in delicious caramelized form. The clerks--a half dozen at peak times--wore identical gray baseball caps that said Pure Dark and brown thermal underwear?with?long sleeves. The uniforms were totally Willie Wonka. The atmosphere of the space was chill and dark and calming. There were a number of counters vending or displaying various?chocolate products, with attendants at the ready to explain the whole concept. It feels like a cult, I thought, and this is the cult's temple. Or maybe it feels like a drug den where chocolate has been substituted for crack. Center of attention is a counter with a glass case wherein three or four types of chocolate barks (priced at $2.75 per ounce) are displayed. The one I like best has pecans and?crystallized ginger on top. The mouth-feel is smooth and creamy, indicating extensive conching--the process by which chocolate is slowly stirred for hours in a small cement mixer called a conch. I buy three ounces of the bark, and the attendant reverently wraps it in brown paper emblazoned with the symbol of a brown cocoa bean. Fake stylized plants bearing this bean caricature are scattered around the cavenous store, like the set of Little Shop of Horrors. Gradually, I was forced by my insane longing for chocolate to join the cult. That's me you see leaning on the mailbox at Charles and Bleecker, a corona of melted chocolate smeared around my face, my eyes empty and dead. Please help me...

Since you are obviously a chocoholic, I'd love you to check out vere ( my company ). You can come to our factory in Chelsea and actually see where our confections are made (I think Pure / Dark is owned by MARS)..and sample complimentary chocolates as well as learn why and where we make our own single origin couverture. All our confections are also pure & dark (no artificial ingredients, no GMO"s, no preservatives) and everything is at least 70% Cacao content...the minimum amount you need to get the benefits of chocolate (health & viagra-like attributes!..yeah) go to our site for the address www.verechocolate.com and when you come ask for me...Kathy

During the holidays, we received a generous gift bag of a variety of items from Pure Dark. The cacao experiences have been beyond our expectations. Sharing (occasionally)with friends has been a delight, especially since we are located in the western foothills of Maine and the closest chocolate candy venue is Cumberland Farms (poor us). Kudos to the Mars people responsible for delivering us from evil with these chocolate delights.

A funny thing happened to me. I was working on a porcelain portrait at my studio, Clayworks on Columbia, in Brooklyn, and a man came stopped in saying that he wanted to make some homemade vinegar and that he wanted a handmade crock to make the process special. He was getting the "mother" from his family in France. I had never heard of the process before but loved his story and was looking forward to the challenge. I got back on the potter's wheel to fill his request. As per usual, when I'm commissioned to make pottery, I do more than is need in case of mishaps. I made two, and fired one to bisque before getting final approval from him, leaving the other one raw so that I would be able to throw it into the slop if not ultimately needed. Well, wouldn't you know, a few weeks later a young couple came in requesting a handmade pot for homemade vinegar that they were going make from the "mother" of Bragg's Cider Vinegar. I showed them the two unfinished pots that I made, complete with a hole at the bottom of each for a tap. They loved the one that the first guy didn't. I completed the process for both, glazing them similarly in browns and blues. The first man picked his up yesterday and the couple came in today. Both were very happy! I have been working at this studio for about ten years or so and have never come across this type of request. Within a few weeks of each other I had two. Isn't that too cool?

I know, that is a coincidence! The couple hopes to give me a piece of the "mother" in a few months so that I can start a batch of my own vinegar. To answer your question, I charged $100. for each of the crocks. They were very happy to have it handmade. Sabina Magnus msmagnus@verizon.net clayworksoncolumbia.org

Hi Sabina, Wow, what a coincidence! I think there's more interest in DIY projects like this now, because it's hard to justify buying bottles of very expensive specialty vinegar anymore...and also because people are realizing that these projects are just really fun and rewarding. About how much does it cost to get a vinegar crock from you? Thanks for reading, Sarah

Adventures in a Crippled Kitchen

? I'd learned to boil hot water on my new hot plate by turning the throttle up to 5 and waiting 5 minutes and 34 seconds, and was soon happily drinking cups of Earl Grey tea and press-pot coffee as if I had a real stove. I didn't miss the gas at all. An alu gobi in the offing But I quickly discovered that routinely setting the hot plate on 5 and then walking off was in general a bad idea, and more than once I found myself running back into the kitchen as smoke poured out the door. So, I started leaving a small notebook next to the hot plate and recording the temps I'd used on various dishes. Clearly, I had to alter my gas-o-centric cooking style, in which a routine meal often saw four pans teetering on the small stove as I simultaneously accomplished several cooking steps in the preparation of a meal. I'd be steaming green beans in one pan, melting butter for a rioux in another, as I boiled water for a hot beverage in a third pan, and rice cooked in a fourth. Such a welter of activity was no longer going to be possible. Nevertheless, several dishes could be prepared as usual. I could cook my Saturday morning buttermilk pancakes on a single skillet perched on the electric burner. But if I wanted bacon, I had to do it first. Still, bacon needs a little time to drain and cool, right? One pot meals were another natural. I could prepare a potato-and-cauliflower curry by first sautéing onions in my deep, cast-iron skillet, deglazing with water or broth, then dumping in the chunks of potato and cauliflower flowerettes. This was foolproof cooking at its best. If I also made a salad, and set out some charcuterie and bruschetta, I had a meal I could invite friends to. In that way, my toaster became my ally. Normally, it sat unused on the counter, as I toasted bread for bruschetta, croutons, and other farinaceous what-nots under the broiler in the oven. But that was no longer possible, so I began to depend on my toaster for various prep steps. It worked especially well for bruschetta--I'd simply toast a big slice of bread, cut it up into smaller pieces, rub with garlic, drizzle with olive oil, and dust with sea salt. Voila! Who needs an oven? I did the same thing with croutons, only cut the bread up into smaller pieces. If I could have figured out a way to stick a steak in the toaster, I would have done that. I fooled around with papadam--the crackling Indian flatbread that can be bought uncooked in South Asian stores in a variety of flavors, including garlic, cardamom, and cumin-seed. For certain dishes, including the potato-and-cauliflower curry (alu gobi) mentioned above, papadam crisped and browned in the toaster provided a perfect accompaniment, better than rice or an oven-baked flatbread. Following is my recipe for the pancakes I cooked on my hot plate.  Robert's Buttermilk Pancakes 1 cup flour, unsifted ½ teaspoon baking soda 1 teaspoon baking powder ½ teaspoon salt 2 tablespoons granulated white sugar Put the above ingredients in a large bowl, and "sift" them together by flinging spoonfuls up into the air until the ingredients are well-mixed. Make a well in the middle of the white mass. 1¼ cup buttermilk (shake the carton up first to homogenize the contents) 2 tablespoons peanut oil 1 extra large free-range egg Pour the above into the well in the dry ingredients. Whip them within the well until the egg is well assimilated. Then whisk the wet into the dry ingredients, making sure to scrape the stuck ones off the bottom of the bowl, but don't whisk so much that the batter becomes smooth. It should have small lumps in it. Let the batter sit for 15 minutes, or, even better, 30 minutes. The batter should develop bubbles from the chemical and microbiological components. Pour batter onto a tempered frying pan or skillet and cook on both sides till brown. If the batter seems a little thick, add a tablespoon or two of water. Next: Timing is Everything

A Modest Proposal--Restaurant Landmarking

POST:
 ? When I got home, I did a bit of research on the web and in my own collection of books about New York City. I turned up almost nada. Judging by the décor, the current M & G exterior, and its curving interior linoleum counter, the place certainly originated in the 1950s or earlier. The front remained emblazoned with the slogan, "Old Fashion' Good" - the fussy apostrophe dating to a time when people still cared about correct punctuation. In fact, M & G was one of the last remaining soul food holdouts in Harlem, a beacon on West 125th Street that instantly evoked the history of the neighborhood going back to the Harlem Renaissance and beyond. There are only two or three of those old-timers that remain. In the ensuing nights, I had a recurring nightmare that Katz's on Houston Street - one of my favorite restaurants in the world - also closed. Overnight, a condo tower rose on the site. In one version of the dream, a place called Katz's is installed in a ground floor retail space, but it looks like a fast-food joint on the Interstate, and the indifferent counterguys are slicing the pastrami and corned beef on slicing machines. Why does it have to be this way? Why is our culinary birthright at the mercy of the whims of real estate developers? The city is quick to grant giant tax abatements and other goodies to developers, why not to restaurateurs? Indeed, we need some sort of cultural landmark system that will forestall the decimation of our cultural treasures. If the city readily permits condo towers to rise over Williamsburg and the Lower East Side, destroying the low-rise character of the neighborhoods in the name of economic progress, why can't we be allowed to retain a handful of restaurants that really matter? How the mechanism of this Heirloom Restaurant Designation would work is not the point of this piece--certainly, there would be many details to work out. It shouldn't be connected in any way to the Landmarks Preservation Commission, which is in the pocket of real estate developers, and often seems concerned only with saving brownstones. But I've started a list of restaurants and other purveyors of prepared food I'd like to see preserved, and fear are in danger of disappearing. I'd love to have additional suggestions. 1. Katz's Deli (Manhattan) 2. Totonno's Pizza (Brooklyn) 3. Mitchell's Soul Food (Brooklyn) 4. Lemon Ice King of Corona (Queens) 5. Patsy's Pizza (Manhattan) 6. La Taza de Oro (Manhattan) 7. Pete's Tavern (Manhattan) 8. Veniero's (Manhattan) 9. Court Pastry Shop (Brooklyn) 10. Eddie's Sweet Shop (Queens) 11. Nathan's Hot Dogs (Brooklyn) 12. Calandra's Cheese (Bronx) 13. Margie's Red Rose (Manhattan)

Robert, I have been crying out for this for two years on my blog, Lost City! We should get together and brainstorm on this. My initial thoughts have been along these lines: get the City to give classic restaurant property tax breaks, or buy the buildings from the landlords and have the City become their landlord, charging the restaurants a dollar a year. This will encourage the restaurants to stay put, as long as the people in charge want to do business, that is.

@ anon - though what you're saying is sadly the reality, there's no price you can put on losing a part of new york history, whether it's a restaurant, a theater, a museum or whatever. it'd be a shame to lose an iconic landmark such as katz's to a heinous avalon development that will be an eyesore for decades to come.

Anonymous, you miss the point. More than 3/4's of the restaurants and bars that both Lost City's Brooks of Sheffield and Robert point out as worthy of restaurant landmarking are not in buildings the proprietor of the establishment owns. Rather their leases and rents are at the whims of greedy landlords who raise the rents sky-high or sell the building outright to a condo developer forcing the restaurant/lounge to go out of business thus destroying the fabric that has made NYCs neighborhood food scene so vibrant and different.

Gasto, Why do you think the trade-offs will always be so easy? What if someone wants to tear down Katz's to build a job training center or an opera house. My point is not to defend "eyesores" but merely to point out that leaving all of the economy in the hands of politicians (central planning) is not always the answer. Sietsema, I'm a democrat. As I've said before, tourists (and anyone else) enjoy Katz by PAYING MONEY to eat there, not just to stare and look at the place. Thus, landmarking is not needed. I'm not against landmarking in theory, just against using it as a means to control parts of the economy that don't need to be controlled. Breadchick, Someone made a similar response on the Eater board, I'll repost my response: A landlord is only able to raise the rent because someone else is willing to pay the higher rent. Someone else can pay this higher rent because their use for the space is more profitable.* This means that they can afford to give their customers more for their money and/or pay their employees/owners more. If you don't like owners making money, the solution is higher taxes, not eliminating the incentive to create wealth to begin with. A restaurant that has locked-in a cheap lease will be at an advantage in a rising rent environment, but will also be at a disadvantage in a falling rent environment. The ability to lock-in prices in this way is ubiquitous to the purchase of many goods and services and does not justify landmarking. * Perhaps there is story you can tell that tenants with market power in other markets can divert these high profits to purchase rich leases to drive out competition, but this sort of thing would potentially violate antitrust laws, and should be addressed by competition authorities and not by landmarking authorities. -Khazer (formerly anonymous)

Mei Li Wah Bakery (formerly Mei Lei Wah Coffee Shop), for sure. Also, what about the Sucelt, on 14th? Is that still around? Strong second for Margie's Red Rose, one of the homiest, warmest and most soulful joints I've ever had the pleasure to eat in. The staff there radiates a warm glow that just lights up the place. I've dug the fried chicken, yeah, but I had one of the best breakfasts of my life a few weeks ago: a fluffy, golden brown stack, a scrambled egg puffed to perfection, fat and juicy sage sausage and a biscuit slathered in soft butter and jelly. With fresh squeezed OJ and coffee, this breakfast will cost you all of 8 bucks and change (which is still probably less pricey than your average hash house, and ten times as good). Afterward, I walked down Adam Clayton Powell, hung a right on 125th, noticed several storefronts boarded up on Frederick Douglas. It's not a given that these great old mom and pop joints will be around forever. Now, that M&G is gone, I'd gladly fight and stand in the cold for Margie's. P.

Khazer makes some good points. Here's another point no one has addressed. There may be cases where chefs/owners of old restaurants just want to retire? While a more profitable use might push out an old locally-popular restaurant, there are other reasons for closings also. I found this thread because I'm a big fan of La Taza d'Oro in Chelsea, and have been looking for other places like it (I'm not from NYC, just visit frequently). I'm very much into preservation of heritage (and discovering new old things), but like Khazer, would rather not distort the creativity of the free market with political leverage. Unintended negative consequences often result. thanks.

Landmarking is designed, at least in theory, to provide a public good - architectural beauty. The "free market" will not naturally produce nice looking buildings because all the people that walk by a nice looking building aren't willing to pay for that privilege. This concept makes absolutely no sense for a restaurant, where you can't enjoy the food unless you pay for it. If a "historic" restaurant goes out of business it's because people are willing to pay more for whatever will exist in its place.

Hey, you must have worked for the Bush administration, judging from your admiration of the free market. I don't give a fuck if someone can make more money by turning Katz's into a K-Mart -- I want my grandchildren to be able to enjoy a Katz's pastrami sandwich, and understand its historic significance in the context of the city. In the long run, having Katz's there is more valuable for tourism, too, since it gives the city "character."

Breadchick is totally right. I did a story last year about the old fashioned French restaurants that are still holding on in and around Hell's Kitchen, which used to be a thriving French neighborhood in the 1940s and 50s. The only places that have been able to survive are restaurants that are proprietor-owned, like Tout Va Bien, which happens to have bought its building half a century ago.

We've also been writing about this issue on my blog Uptownflavor for the past 3 years. We have slowly watched, one by one, the old fashioned restaurants disappear and be replaced with fast food restaurants over the past 10 years. While I can't wrap my brain around the landmarking of a restaurant that doesn't own the property (as is the case with all of the places in Harlem) I would like to see some sort of emergency fund that these places can apply for through the City in order to keep their restaurants afloat. Low interest loans or subsidies approved by a committee that reviews the upgrades, etc. proposed by the owners. Better than just letting these places turn into yet another Popeye's Chicken. As far as the history of the old M&G, ask any native Harlemite. My friend Sharon says that the original M&G was in another location and moved to the current (defunct) location which formerly housed a chicken place (hence the signage). Dig a little deeper and it will turn up on the Internet.

I am French & for those who do not know, France is the first producer of Foie Gras. The diseased liver of those tortured birds means that 40 million ducks & 500,000 geese die from being force-fed each year. 80 percent of those animals are grown in factory farms. Is there a hierarchy in cruelty? Would a force-fed bird from a small farm choose the life of a factory farm chicken? Probably not as it does not think about it. But what is sure is that both animals feel pain just as we do & that we have the power to be compassionate.

Joseph, you are right. PETA is doing the same with the carriage operators of Central Park, too. The NYC carriage trade is the most regulated in the world. The horses get better treatment than they do in many other equine sports. Yet, they are villified. If PETA can take down the largest and most iconic carriage trade in the world it would set a precedent to do it elsewhere. Just as they say the birds are being tortured, they say the horses are being mistreated. Where are the cruelty violations? Where is the proof? There simply isnt any, and they know it. So, they resort to lies, propaganda, and harassment. One of these days the rest of the world will sit up and take notice. Until then, all we can do is hope people arent all easily led fools like the PETA followers.

What is the big deal? The feeder grabs each bird and plunges the metal pipe of the feeding machine down the birds' throat. The machine pumps a corn-and-oil mixture directly into their gullets in just a few seconds, equivalent to one-fourth to one-third of the birds' own body weight each day. In a matter of weeks, their livers swell up to ten times their normal size. Breathing and walking become difficult as the liver pushes against other organs, causing respiratory stress due to decreased air sac space in their lungs, and forcing the legs to move outward at an unnatural angle. Ducks at foie gras farms have been observed panting and struggling to stand, using their wings to push themselves forward when their crippled legs can no longer support them. Struggling to move causes infection-prone open pressure sores to develop and fester on their hocks (legs) and keels (chest area). Their plumage becomes encrusted with filth, and most of them develop what foie gras farmers call "wet neck"-when their unpreened feathers curl up and become coated with dirt and oil. What's the big deal?

Nicolas is repeating the formulaic screed about torturing geese by "force-feeding" them. PETA sympathizers turn a blind eye to the fact that geese and ducks who are fed grain by a funnel in the last weeks of their lives are anything but "tortured". In numerous articles, I've read that they come running to be fed. While there may be French factory farms where animals are confined during the process, that is not the case with American foie gras producers. I don't see why journalists would lie -- tortured domestic animals makes a better story than happy ones. What is lost here is the hardly-secret agenda of PETA to stop the use of animals for human consumption. Foie gras=torture is one small step along that path, and the fact that it happens not to be true is inconsequential to them.

Yes, those peta people have blood in their eye and not enough to worry about. The fact that we have people starving every day even 5 miles where I live in newark, new jersey warrants a bit more attention than the force feeding of geese. The fact that children in this and other countries do not get enough high quality protein in their diet, and too much unhealthy processed carbohydrates to give them type 2 diabetes as early as the age of 8, should be of greater interest. We have all drunk the Koolaid on the "right" thing to do and in many cases its just plain wrong. Pass the foie gras. And don't forget the gin.

What a juvenile proposition--where are the writer's critical thinking skills? There are always many "worthy targets" for intervention. Does that negate the importance of this one? No. Are those battles being fought? You can be sure of it. Your assertion that these tortured birds live great lives and receive wonderful care is absurd--the sort of line that all animal abusers posit. Along the lines of saying that animals used in dog-fighting are lucky to be alive. Pure stupidity. There are many delicious treasures in the world of food that do not involve gratuitous torture. I agree with others who have synthesized some of the problems at the Voice: it is a useless and outdated "news source" and that is why readership keeps sinking. Trying to model it after the bitchy "Sex and the City" mindset of consumerism, excess, and cruel fashion is not going to help. How about writing that is lively, spirited, thought-provoking, and useful? Not this trash.

 A few years ago, Zak Pelaccio and Ana Jovancicevic told me about a wonderful Trinidadian snack shop on Nostrand Avenue in Crown Heights called A & A Bake and?Doubles.?Sadly (for Brooklynites, at least), the closet of a place closed last year and relocated to Queens. I had my first chance to check it out last weekend, and the new space is magnificent. In addition, the menu has been expanded to add more Trinidadian street snacks than were available in the old place. Now there are booths, too--the old place had zero seating, and only enough space for three people to stand and wait for their doubles and bakes. New address: 120-09 Liberty Avenue, Richmond Hill, Queens, 718-659-7400  Shown above, the doubles (the word is singular as well as plural)?remains fantastic--twin miniature pooris sliding back and forth over a sloppy filling of chick peas in curry sauce. Weekends are the traditional time to enjoy doubles, and sometimes you can still find?small boys selling them from ice chests (which keep the pooris hot) along Nostrand Avenue as it runs from Eastern Parkway to Atlantic Avenue. The new A & A also sells aloo pie, a longish?fritter sluiced with the same chick pea curry, a popular street snack in Port of Spain, Trinidad's capital. Here is a picture of A & A's rendition: And here is the version I ate on the streets of Trinidad's capital last year: But the big news is not that these delicious snacks ($1.50 each!) are available in Richmond Hll, but that they are coming back to Brooklyn. The owner told me a new branch of A & A Bake and Doubles would soon be opening (a week or two, he said) near the corner of Nostrand Avenue and Church Avenue. We couldn't be happier.

Piled on the other side of the platter is a deep-red, crunchy mix of shredded daikon seasoned with chile-garlic sauce and scallions. This mixture harbors a generous serving of raw oysters, which comes as a surprise when you're crunching on spicy radish and get a goopy bite that gushes oyster brine. Wrap a slab of pork belly in a piece of napa cabbage, top it with the radish-oyster combo, and drizzle it with "traditional shrimp sauce"--a sickly-pink liquid flecked with red that's very salty and funky but is perfect as a part of the whole.Ga Si Ri 162-04 Northern Boulevard Flushing, Queens, 718-888-9400

POST:
In conjunction with our review of Jersey City's new vegetarian restaurant, Krishna Cuisine, and for people who would rather look at pictures of food than read about it, here are some photographs of the principal dishes. One of the remarkable appetizers presented, as far as we can time, for the first time in the Tri-State area, is the Maharashtrian pakora of fried onions with a few pieces of potato thrown in for textural contrast. With its dusting of powdered spices, these fritters blow diner onion rings out of the water:  Also in a northern India vein are the paneer pakora, only one of many uses this fresh cheese finds on the menu at Krishna Cuisine:  Presented with sambal and two pungent chutneys, all homemade, the iddly are a fine bellwhether of the southern cooking prowess of the restaurant: More unusual are the rava dosas, which introduce the goodness of wheat flour to the lentil-rice dosa formula: Most bizarre is a dosa not unique to this restaurant, but unique enough that we only know of three other places that serve it. Ta-daah [drum roll], the family dosa, in which the potato filling is served on the side, and there's enough for everybody: Finally, we have a couple of the revamped Mughal curries that constitute the restaurant's greatest gift to?Jersey diners, curries prepared with scintillatingly fresh ingredients:? Palak paneer on the left, and gobi masala on the right. 795 Newark Avenue, Jersey City, NJ, 201-659-8700?

Hello there yes this is Mexican tradition for so many years and I encourage this to my kids since there are a lot of Mexican traditions that my parents left behind I try to learn them for my kids. They wait for this "Dia De Reyes" all year long it is something special for them and they get happy when I take them to chose the "Rosca."

In search of a well-explained "Dia de Reyes" tradition, I found this website. exactly what i needed because for years my family and I have been cutting the Rosca on this day, we are always so excited to see who is going to get the baby Jesus, this year we bought our rosca at a different place, lets just say it was not at a Mexican Bakery, we are so disappointed and offended that this Bakery would target the Latino community with out knowing our culture, let me explain... they did not add no baby Jesus, we keep cutting and cutting and never found it!!! i will print a good explanation of what it truly means to us . and perhaps "this bakery" will learn something. thank you for creating a this website.

We celebrated this with our family and had a good laugh. We never found a baby Jesus. We were a little dissappointed but got the Mexican bakery to give us a new one. Lucky me, I get to host the party, can't wait! Love the stories.

Please permit me to tell you a little of what I know as the "Dia de Los Reyes". This is the day of Epiphany when the 3 kings took the baby Jesus gifts. Remember that when King Herod heard of the "new born king" being born, and the kings went by where King Herod lived and asked where this new king was, King Herod became very jealous and scared.....that another might take his kingdom. So he had all the little boys killed from age 0 to 2, to avoid letting this "new king" take over. This is the reason the figure of the baby is hidden inside the bread. Signifying that when the angel appeared to Joseph and told him to take the baby and Mary and leave so that the baby would not get killed, they "hid" the baby from king Herod. NOW, when the person gets the baby in the "rosca de reyes", this person must have a big celebration on February 2nd, which is the "Fiesta de la Candelaria". It is believed this is also the day when the Virgen Mary took the baby Jesus to present him at the temple. We started this tradition in my family before my Mother passed away, and we continue it in her honor. It is believed (at least in MY family) that whoever gets the baby is richly blessed during that year. Thanks for letting me share!

Hi Daniel, I don't have a recipe myself, but I did find this good-looking one online: http://mexicanfood.about.com/od/tortillasandbreads/r/threekingsbread.htm This bread is a bit different from the one I wrote about, as it has candied fruit, but that seems to be the traditional thing to do anyway.

How curious! We have a tradition in New Orleans so similar it's almost identical, going back many generations. Our King Cakes appear almost identical to the rosca pictured, but we serve them at parties throughout Carnival season, from Twelfth Night until Mardi Gras. Whoever gets the baby Jesus (or other figurine) in the cake has to bring the cake for the next King Cake Party.

Back in 2001, Barack Obama appeared on "Check Please!" a round-table food show on Chicago's WJNO. The episode never aired, but is now being resurrected and is showing on January 16th. Obama's bit on the show is split into the these two videos. As Gawker pointed out, Mr. President seems to misunderstand the idea of a round-table discussion, totally dominating the conversation. The other people on the show start to glaze over. Whatevers. He didn't miss his calling as a restaurant reviewer, but you've got to have a big ego to be President.

The Early Word -- Samakmak

POST:
 Sizzle sizzle goes the cast-iron vessel, as a pair of snails parades across the table, oblivious of the food drama?transpiring inches away. We've ordered one of the oddball tajines at Samakmak, the euphonious name of a new Egyptian seafood cafe, recently joining Bahary and Asmak Taama in the collection of Alexandrian restaurants within a single block of each other in Bay Ridge. Which is the best? We're still thinking about it...  The tajines of Samakmak are certainly a lure. While we'd expected a Moroccan style seafood dish, what arrived was positively Sicilian in its outlook: plump shrimp and squid rings of scarily large circumference deposited in a spicy tomato sauce that also contained lots of garlic and onion. The idea of sizzling it in a cast-iron skillet was brilliant, because the seafood rapidly became clotted with a thick flavorful paste that did nothing to distract from the fresh taste of the crustaceans. Our other favorite dish might also be placed in the "Incredibly Cheap Eats" part of this blog, since four pink fish, lightly crusted with starch and fried, devoid of nothing save their internal organs, set us back an astonishing $12 -- that's $3 for each of four people to have their own fish, and a largish one at that, as far as red mullet are concerned. Other dishes went up and down -- we didn't like the grilled tilapia, which taste like river mud, but we loved the eggplant appetizer, which glistened in the glow of the Eyptian TV -- a constant in each of these cafes. This one is a little more upscale looking than the other two, and fearsomely decorated with objet d'art like ropes, harbor lights, buoys, fishing nets, etc. Good date spot? Maybe. Here are my friends Suzette and Kate sitting in front of the giant photo of Alexandria. 6916 Fourth Avenue, Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, 718-491-0006  ? ?

"...a restaurant that probably has lots of mob connections." Why? because It's an Italian American place? Do you think you can make such glib, unsubstantiated and offensive comments just because of your surname? If it were an Arab place in Brooklyn would you make a dopey remark about "it probably has a lot of jihadi connections"?

  They came in a clear cellophane bag with bright red trim. They looked pretty good, but as I peered into the bag I couldn't really tell what they were. "Kong kang," said the counterguy with a smile. "You don't mean kang kung," I replied, using a common name for water spinach. The shopkeeper looked over at his companions and they all started to guffaw. Had I just made my first joke in Siamese, or had I just made a fool of myself? Either way, the curled brown snacks proved delicious when I got them home--salty and sweet at the same time, with a whiff of exotic herbs that may have included lemongrass and screwpine. There were some chile flakes in the mix, too, making them a perfect snack. A little web and cookbook research yielded inconclusive results, except that the snack is sometimes called in English "rice worms." Enlighten me if you know more about this snack, which is available at Ayada Grocery, 76-13 Woodside Avenue, Elmhurst, Queens, 718-426-5006.

POST:
Chapter 3: The Test Drive [Read the?continuing saga from the beginning here.] Arriving home one day to find the gas shut off in my West Village?apartment building, I ran out and bought a one-burner hot plate for $29.95. The?one with two burners cost only $10 more, but what did I need two burners for? The gas would be turned on again in a day or two, I was certain, and the prospect of finding a place to stash the two-burner model in my tiny apartment was as daunting as the temporary shut-off.? For hot plate aficionados, here are the specs: Sky Appliances, Hornilla Electrica, Modelo SS1520, 1000 Watts, Adjustable Control Knob (1 to 5), Metal Drip Pan, Easy to Use, 110V, 60 Hz. Two further specs caused me some concern: 1) "Household Use Only," and 2: "Continuous improvements made in product development may result in slight differences between the photograph on this box and the actual contents." As opposed to the imaginary contents? And what would those be? As I unpacked the box, I strained my eyes to see if there were "development" differences between the picture on the box and my model. I couldn't detect any. As I set up the hot plate next to my refrigerator, I noted approvingly how little space it took up on the counter. It looked cozy next to the blender and the food processor, kind of like a garage next to a pair of high rises. Damned if I wasn't proud of my new contraption, especially how downscale it was, like something one might cook on in the Third World. Luckily, I could count on the electricity being available 24 hours a day, which is something you can't count on in Bamako or East Timor. I filled up my teapot--which resembles a black-spotted Jersey cow--and placed it on the heating element, which resembles a black snake ready to spring. Gunning the machine like a biker doing a wheelie, I turned the knob all the way up to 5, keeping my fingers crossed that it wouldn't immediately set off the circuit breaker. It didn't. Nevertheless, the hot plate made little creaking and groaning sounds as it heated up, like wind in the sails of a frigate. I've never cooked on an electric stove. I've always been an advocate of gas ranges, and scoffed whenever anyone mentioned that they were saddled with an electric stove. Thus I was surprised to find the water in the cow coming to a boil more quickly than it had on my gas range. Weird. 5 minutes, 34 seconds, with the pot full. For boiling water, at least, the hot plate was proving more efficient than my ghetto gas stove. Could these results be extrapolated to other aspects of the cooking experience?

 In my rant about raisin pie, I neglected to mention where I'd found it: rural Pennsylvania, a few miles east of Gettysburg and just north of the Maryland border. I'm at a writers' workshop, but here's the catch: I'm not here as a writer, but as a cook. The participants are science fiction writers, but not what you might normally think of as science fiction writers. As one of the 14 told me this morning with some disdain, "We don't do hardcore science fiction." Another chimed in, "We couldn't do hardcore science fiction," by which he meant space-oriented stories set in the future and underpinned by all sorts of technical jargon, both real and invented. Rather, these science fiction writers inhabit the realm of fantasy. They sit all day at two long trestle tables on the ground floor of one of the houses that comprise the facility. (The other, with a rumpus room in the basement decorated with lifesize cut-outs of football heroes in action poses, is technically a converted barn.) These writers prefer to write all at the same time. It's like they're in a public library, only the setting is a bed and breakfast that reaches the height of its popularity in the summer months, when tourists flood into the region to inspect the Gettysburg battlefield, and undergo the ancillary attractions that dot the landscape. Do I need to mention that the bed and breakfast is filled with kitsch of the most tasteless and flagrant sort?  Now, Gettysburg is a baleful, brooding landscape, and the overcast skies and bone-chilling dampness only add to the effect. We can see a ridge that figured in one phase of the battle from the wooden deck at the rear of the old stone house. We can also see fallow fields of truncated corn stalks, copses of oak and black walnut trees, and herds of dairy cattle who sit in the mud all day contentedly, and only occasionally rise to get a bite to eat. The writers like to talk back and forth and help each other with spellings, obscure words, names of characters, etc. I really didn't see how they got very much done in the course of a day, but then the name of this sort of gathering is "retreat," and part of the fun of a retreat is ignoring your perceived responsibilities and then joking about it. "How many words did you do today?" is a common question, and 900 seemed to be a very good answer. "I'm writing a short story about steam punk vampires in 19th century New York City," another one would say, helping me to figure out the sort of things they were working on. Another participant seemed to be writing a scene about talking vegetables in the supermarket. The friend who recruited me is a vegetarian. So I resolved to cook only vegetarian food. I knew this would be a hard sell for diehard carnivores, but it only made the proposition more appealing, since I wasn't getting paid for my efforts, and I was chipping in my $170 for the five days just like any normal science fiction writer. But how to cook great vegetarian food in the extremely conservative environment of rural Pennsylvania, where the visage of Lincoln seems to be frowning down at you from evey lamppost and building? I knew than in the last decade, even the most remote areas had acquired supermarkets the size of football fields stocked with viands every corner of the earth. Even parts of the country far from prosperous had these sorts of retail establishments; it was a function of the global economy. These place didn't carry anything locally grown, in general, even though farm fields spread before me as far as the eye could see.  I found my dream supermarket on the south end of Littlestown, our nearest village, on the road that headed toward the Maryland border. I had promised to make a Chinese stir fry, and I knew that, among all the TV dinners and chemically laced food, I'd find fundamental Asian things. I grabbed a cart at the front door, noting that all of the milling employees looked to be about 15 or 16 years old. In short order, I'd collected fresh ginger, a bunch of beautiful miniature scallions, firm Japanese tofu, high-sodium soy sauce, fresh garlic, and a cornucopia of fresh veggies, including wonderful sugar snap peas. I'd also found an assortment of dried lo meins. Back at the kitchen of the stone house, I started chopping, boiling, and stir-frying, and in short order made a delicious heap of noodles, nicely browned in the skillet (no wok here, believe me). At the last minute I decided it needed something, so I made a flat two-egg omelet and cut it into strips to add to the concoction. The dinner didn't go over as well as I'd hoped, although several ate it and proclaimed it tasty. I'd been warned that most of the writers were junk food fans, and, indeed, they'd stocked the larder with frozen pizzas, snack chips, and boxed meals. When I opened the freezer, the face of Jimmy Dean beamed back at me. The next night I did much, much better. Near the middle of Littlestown, I found a Mexican grocery story. The selection of dried chiles and Oaxcan white cheeses was as good or better than anything I could get in New York. I went wild, and filled a shopping cart with white-corn tortillas and whole dried chiles and ripe plum tomatoes. I even found fresh garbanzo beans still in their husks. I went home and made bandera ("flag") enchiladas with two sauces, red and green. The red enchiladas I stuffed with sautéed zucchini and shiitake mushrooms. The green were stuffed with crumbled fresh cheese and raw onions. I baked them just long enough to melt the cheese on top, and served them with extra sauce. They were a big hit among one and all. Even the diehard carnivores loved them. Next: I reconnoiter the restaurants of the Gettysburg and Hanover area.

What a sad, narrow-minded, typical New Yorker attitude about the kitchens and culinary treats of Central Pennsylvania. I grew up there, did the post-college New York publishing career shuffle for a decent portion of my adult life, then decided the entire idea of "New Yorkness" is a self-obsessed smoke and mirrors dance of pure gibberish and cultural snobbishness about the beautiful regions and people that exist outside the five boroughs. I grew up outside Gettysburg, just to the west in fact. I have friends from Littlestown who can cook a damn better apple crisp than any half-baked city-dweller concoction you can get in the Hudson Valley. "That's not so!" you say. Well, Adams County apples are tangy, crisp, and sweet from that moist weather you seem to be lamenting about. Drive north up to Biglersville, past the Round Barn, and see the miles after miles of orchards for yourself, if you can get away from the Deep Space Nine crowd. Plus, if you were to go a scant half-a-block to the West of that Lincoln picture in the Gettysburg Square, you would find one of the better restaurants in Central Pennsylvania, The Blue Parrot, a pre-Civil War era oyster bar. The food is just as good as anything you'd get in a West Village Fusion Bistro for about 1/3 the price. Did you try the Caledonia Bistro, about 10 miles west? Or the Fairfield Inn? The Cashtown Inn? The Appalachian Brewery? El Costeno? The Farnsworth House? The Herrstown Inn? I once had Beef Colorado at Montezumas in downtown Gettysburg so spicy it made me tear up. It was truly a kick-butt experience and way better than any authetic taco joint I've ever had on between the 100s and 130s on the upper east side. Or, at least please tell me you've tried shoe fly pie? New Yorkers fascination with "tapas" is just as strange to people from Central PA (after 10 years in Manhattan, no one has been able to explain what it means to me other then a small dish... why in Christs name would you pay 20 dollars for a small plate?). Classic Keystone State delights like green tomato pie, apple butter, birch beer, grape pie, raisin pie, grilled venison (that we, personally, shot, mind you), and Lebanon Bologna just aren't that strange to us, so stop treating us like creatures from a different planet. Chase a couple of these things with a Yuegaling or a hoppsy Troegs (Central PA brewed winner of multiple beer world cups) and it is some kind of subjective heaven. Go eat guinea pig in Peru if you want a cultural experience. My friend, I know you are writing for the erudite "best and brightest" New York crowd, but please don't call my neck of the woods a "backwater." We have plenty of great local cuisine, farm grown with well-worn cupboards full of family recipes 5, 6, 7 generations deep and some still penned in German. It's a shame you weren't able to go out and find these places and that your New York culinary world view of "fresh ingredients" consists of what is available at the Green Market in Union Square. It takes 4 hours to get to Manhattan to Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. It also takes about the same length of time to travel the Thruway to Lake George. No one seems to revel in labeling the rural Lake George, the Finger lakes, Glenn Falls, and the Catskills regions a "conservative backwater" yet New Yorkers love to point to the middle of Pennsylvania, laugh, and call it hinterland with "statues of Lincoln." Thank you for coming to my state and my neck of the woods. No thanks for your inadequate immersion for a full ethnographic experience. David Brooks pulled this same "just because you don't have a Thai place" stunt a while back and is still quite loathed for publishing such a demeaning piece in The Atlantic. Next time you're browsing the magazine racks in the Barnes and Noble outside Washington Square, just take a notice of The Gettysburg Review, situated (usually) right beside the Paris Review and that neo-Brooklynite-bible, McSweenys and then remind yourself of your condescending attitude to the people and cuisine of a beautiful region of Blue Ridge foothills, just above the Mason Dixon line, at the high water mark of the greatest internal struggle in United States history.

Brooklyn Artisans: Gentrification = Elephant in the Room
AUTHOR:

POST:
That sure sounds to me like the people who moved to Brooklyn in the recent wave of gentrification. I'm not saying the artisans or their customers are a band of spoiled rich kids. Far from it. Gentrification isn't necessarily bad, it just is--inevitable in many ways. You could say I'm part of the wave of gentrification in my Brooklyn neighborhood, and I can't help that. No one really can--everyone's just looking for an affordable place to live. But we should pay attention to how our neighborhoods change, for better and worse. By neglecting to mention the wave of gentrification that's given rise to these new artisans, the article lacks a context that's important. It's great that a new generation of Brooklynites are starting small food businesses. It means more good eating, and a less corporate approach to food. But it's simply worth noting that there are demographic changes--changes that are sometimes harmful to older businesses--that have made Brooklyn into "The East Coast of Berkley."?

Whoa. I disagree with you, gentrification is bad. Gentrification doesn't "just happen"-- it is an intersection of race and class that affects people at their most vulnerable...housing. It happens when it becomes trendy to live in a neighborhood (which is spurred by marketing, articles, renaming, rezoning, etc.). First the white bohemians move in and then it seems safer for the other white middle class...then the boutiques and upscale restaurants move in. (in a nutshell) It's bad because it displaces people who were in a neighborhood previously by raising their rents or by landlords favoring gentrifying tenants over working families. Or with landlords intentionally trying to buy people out of their buildings. Most of these "culinary marvels" aren't reflective of their neighborhoods or residents...just "artisans" benefiting from cheap(er) rent than say Manhattan. Hopefully, with the downturn in the economy and real estate, the lighting fast pace of gentrification that we have seen in the past few years can come to a halt and NYC can be celebrated as the diverse place it is instead of the homogeneity of gentrified neighborhoods. Do we really need that many more nibs and hand made pickles that the other neighborhood residents can't afford to buy?

To "Ummm..." No, the author did not place a value on gentrification...that was what my problem was. She was saying that it's something that "just happens" which is what I disagreed with. I believe it's something more systematic than that. And I thought it was thoughtless to not mention the people who are affected by this. My blog comment wasn't meant to offer solutions, but to critique the posting. That's something part of a larger discussion than can be made on a blog comment. But if you can't do the research yourself, there are quite a few community organizations and tenant rights groups that try to battle gentrification through different campaigns and strategies and based on the neighborhood. Fifth Avenue Committee, Make the Road by Walking, Community Voices Heard, Pratt Area Community Council, Met Council are a few organizations that come to mind. There are other groups that push something called gentrification offsets, that I don't necessarily agree with. A lot of people out there are doing this work if you don't want to be a part of the "horrible tide." Also here's a no brainer...you don't have to live in these neighborhoods!

ok Sarinaya say you're a young person not from the area looking for a cheap place to live. What are you supposed to do? Where ar you supposed to live. Areas like sunset park/Long island city/jamaica/Red Hook/clinton hill/bushwick are affordable. Why doesn't everyone have the right to live in cheaper housing? This is part of New York. Tides of different population splashing against neighborhoods. It's what has been happening here since the 1600's. Good luck whining about it

? [SideDish via Eater] Carla was not prepared and in over her head. The show did not talk about how the first course (crab) took her half of the friggin' cooking time that day, I was left to work the rest of HER dishes.She also did not have a plan. The ONLY thing she had in mind was a cheese course! I would NEVER do a cheese course. And where in the hell did french come from!? She is not even classically trained! It (the show) didn't talk about how I worked on a sauce for 2 days and Carla forgot to put it on the plate... It didn't show how the 2nd course (fish) was MINE. It didn't show how she took the sous vide idea and decided to GRILL it last minute causing it to be tough... And it didn't show how she WANTED to do the souffles which she does not even know how to make! That was HER food, because it certainly was me asking her how she wanted to do this and that while she was busy picking crab the entire time and making a souffle that didn't rise!I am done with TC. I did not influence her. She has NO ideas of her own, oh, except a cheese course.

Casey pushed Carla into a corner. Carla stayed there so it's her fault, but she never should have been pushed in the first place. Those pushy male sous chefs did not push the contestants. They just followed their lead. Why couldn't Casey do that? Why did she try to take over? If Carla had won, Casey would have tries to take credit for it! Maybe that was the agenda. The men were dismissive of Carla all season in a manner I thought was very sexist. Even when she won multiple challenges, the men on the show were constantly dismissing her. She kept beating them, drove away with a new car, and they still kept writing her off. Carla has to accept responsibility for submitting to Casey's will. (Think about the funky racial politics of Carla letting Casey tell her what to do!) However, Casey was completely out of line. Did you hear how disrespectful she was when she spoke to Carla? She was politely bullying her into doing what she wanted. She knew Carla had a plan, and she kept pressuring her to change it. She knew Carla had never cooked sous-vide, and she pushed her to do it, and it was done wrong. They didn't show the whole thing, but I think Casey controlled that dish and it bombed. Did you notice that they loved the sauce (Carla), but hated the beef (Casey) The other sous chefs did not pressure the main chefs from doing what they wanted to do even if they disagreed. That was the right choice. The sous chef doesn't dictate to the executive chef! Ever. Those boys never had to say no to their sous chefs, because the sous chefs didn't pressure them.Casey clearly saw this as another opportunity to shine. She wanted to look like a star. She did not seem to care about Carla at all. The reason I blame Casey is that she put Carla into such a difficult position. Carla would have had to confront and challenge Casey in order to manage the situation while also continuing to get Casey to cook for her. It was a horrible situation that Casey put Carla in. Carla kept the peace but lost the competition. Wrong choice. She has to live with it, but its heart breaking.

So sad for Carla, she ended up listening to her sous chef & missed out on the win. Had she kept the "love" & soul in her food & eschewed the fancy shmansy stuff she would have pulled the upset. Its true though, I either want the underdog or the Asshole to win, not the dopey middle of the heard guy...

Sexist, shmexist. Carla just wasn't a Top Chef. Stefan didn't write off Jamie, because Jamie is a serious chef. It has nothing to do with sexism. Stefan should have won. I feel dirty having watched that season knowing that Stefan, who was best that the show's ever seen, lost over completely arbitrary standards. He made the best dish of the night. He made a great dish out of alligator meat. He made a real meal from beginning to end. He won 4 elimination challenges and 4 quick fire challenges. He dominated and lost over some ridiculous bias. The show lost all credibility and its name is now a joke.

I think it is crazy to say this had anything to do with sexism or racism like Di did in the first comment. This is not the first time the middle person won instead of the jerk or favorite. Marcel should have beat that loser who nobody cares to remember and Blaise pulled defeat out of the same jaws of victory as Carla did last night. They were instructed to make the best three dishes they could and if Stefan thought that desert was one of his best then he made a mistake. I don't care for sweets and would have been much happier ending my meal with the venison dish than the banana lollipop. I really thought it would be a battle between Fabio and Stefan as they seemed to take their culinary style more serious than any of the other chefs. I think people keep forgetting that at the end of the show Fabio even gives the nod to Hosea, much to his obvious dismay.

Funny thing is that I started out disliking Stefan, but he grew on me because he's simply that good. His body of work is far more superior to Hosea who also talked about as much smack. Remember when he put down Carla's green eggs & ham because it was too simple...only for her to end up winning the quickfire with it? He's a 24/7 kiss ass. Every week, the guest judge is the chef in the world. Every restaurant is 5 star. And his hands are always shaking because he's so nervous about being in the presence of such greatness. And he became so obsessed with beating Stefan that he became a bigger douche than he ever was. But ultimately he had to horde ingredients from Stefan to beat him. I was rooting for Carla, with Stefan a close second. This guy will be a distant memory just like Ilan after he inexplicably beat Marcel. Top Chef needs to go back to one on one finales, save the also-rans for the occasional specials or as guest judges but NOT for competing in the current season, scale back the product placement, get rid of Toby, bring back Bourdain, consider body of work, and stop all the case by case judging that seems to reward mediocrity.

I don't think anyone can blame Casey for giving her opinion to Carla, because it was Carla's own decision to play nice and not take the lead she needed to take in order to win. Everyone saw that the changes Casey suggested were not things Carla was comfortable with, even though she said they were good ideas. She didn't play to her strengths and stay true to herself, which is why she was so upset with herself at the end. Casey was trying to do her best to assist Carla, but Carla needed to step it up a bit more and say confidently, "Hey this is what the plan is..." As for the supposed rant Casey made as posted on some other websites, that is some great fiction writing. Who in their right mind would actually believe she would say that crap about Carla???? I guess that's just some good creative drama to keep us on the edges of our cushy couches.

Someone has to stop Tom. He just didn't like Stefan and didn't want him to win. I'm not sure if the producers just wanted a surprise ending, but this finale definitely left a bad taste in my mouth. I was a big Top Chef fan, but I won't be watching the show anymore. Hosea is a joke and should never have even made it as far as he did. Why are they basing their decision on cooking with "soul"? Stefan does have soul and a passion for food. He just doesn't express in the way that Gail or the others want to see it. But that may just be a culture difference. Perhaps they should judge the food blindly in next season, not knowing who cooked which dish. Toby had a rough start, always searching for the shocking quip. He's not a chef. Bourdain would be the perfect choice. Padma simply will bend to whatever the others think.

A little late, but just watched because I was out of town. Angry enough to find a place to post. Agree wholeheartedly with Derek. Hosea sucks and you couldn't pay me to eat at his restaurant. I am happy to eat at Fabio's, Stefan's or Carla's. Will not be watching next season. What is the point if the best chef doesn't win? Carla messed up and couldn't overcome it, but I would have loved for her to trust herself. Stefan won the most and had the best dish of the night, that should have been impossible for mediocre Hosea to overcome. Complete b.s.

I too missed the finale and am thankfully happy I did otherwise I think I may have smashed my tv. Stefan was handsdown the better chef, I would have been happy with Carla winning but Hosea is a joke. He's a good chef but clearly not as skilled or soulful as the other two. I loved Top Chef but I cannot bring myself to watch it ever again because its b.s.

carla grilled the sirloin after it came out of the sous-vide bath. which was really stupid and made it tough (and which she should never have been advised/allowed to do. how, please, someone explain who knows the backstory, on earth did carla end up putting a grill on the sirloin). but, yes, it is a huge tragedy. though still very much the underdog, this was carla's to win, really, particularly after her multiple home runs in the first finale episode. her mistake on the souffle was MAJOR, though i also wonder what the role of the sous chef can be regarding checking on all those little things like temperature, etc., particularly if some of those things were more Casey's idea.

He's a jerk that occasionally does something nice, the complete opposite of Stefan, who seems like the sort of dude who plays nice only to disappear the morning after. I think you meant Josea at some point here. The writing is really awkward and confusing.

Like many, I was also sick to my stomach after this most recent finale... Each episode's final challenge should be judged on its own merit. But the season finale should and must take into account the chefs' body of work during the show. The fact that Stefan won the majority of challenges and quick fires should count towards him for sure. The only ways Stefan should have lost is if he was completely outshined by another contestant (not the case, in fact the judges agreed that he had the best dish), or if he flubbed a dish (like poor Carla and her Souffle). I am not watching this silly show any more. Contests that don't get it right and reward the correct person are stupid and not worth my time. The new judge Toby (and Stefan, Carla, and Jamie) were the best thing about this season...I'm so sick of Padma and Tom.

 Things get so strange when you travel to unfamiliar parts of the country. Especially in the most rural areas. While American cities have to a certain extent become homogenized -- with the same franchised restaurants and the same nationally distributed?brands -- rural parts of the country remain deliciously distinctive and, well, strange.  Witness the product picture above. I found myself having to take a leak on Highway 15 this afternoon on my way here, and I went into the?convenience store attached to the gas station. The gas station, btw, had the unfamiliar name "Rutters," which means "horny characters" to me, but around these parts means "gas." Feeling a bit peckish, I decided to have what we used to call in Texas, a "fried pie." Sometimes these resemble turnovers, other times they're configured like?tiny pies, complete with miniature aluminum pie tins.   In this case, the latter pertained, but I was somewhat surprised to see the selection. In New York, we have lemon, and apple, and maybe Boston creme pie, but here the pies ran to blueberry and coconut and peach. OK. But then I spied in the back row a raisin pie, and it flipped me out. Who'd put raisins in a pie, I wondered out loud, as the hunters in camouflage fatigues congregated by the cash register turned to look at me curiously. I purchased the raisin pie and took it out to the car to study it in privacy. Unwrapping it from its wax paper, I first discovered a top crust of medium brown perforated?by four symmetrical holes. ?  I next took my pocketknife out and, like a shucker removing the top shell of an oyster, ran the knife around the rim of the pie and removed the top crust. Inside were a score of bloated raisins in a sort of light-brown cornstarch gravy. I gingerly put my finger in and pulled out a raisin and ate it. Hmmm. Not bad! ? ? Related Content Related Stories...

The beet kimchi sounds really good, particularly if a sweeter beet was used. Off to Google it and see if I can come close to a recipe -- thanks!!

 A friend just called this to my attention (via Jezebel). It's the first episode of a show called Great Depression Cooking, featuring a 90-something, pretty adorable woman named Clara showing you the dishes that her family used to cook during the Great Depression. Well, hooray, we're all poor again, so now is the perfect time to make Clara's pasta with peas.

Strange Snacks of the World -- Sel Roti

POST:
Sel Roti at Mustang Thakali Kitchen Sel roti is a bread beloved of Nepalis, featured during their Festival of Lights, but also eaten as an everyday snack. It's made with rice flour and resembles an anorexic Krispy Kreme. Sometimes banana is added to amp up the sweetness, but the version served at Mustang Thakali Kitchen in Jackson Heights is only slightly sweet, and fit for eating with savory curries. A little dab of daikon pickle comes on the side.?74-14 37th Avenue, Jackson Heights, Queens, 718-898-5088? Here is a Youtube of sel roti being prepared at home:

Colicchio Shills For Coke
AUTHOR:

POST:
 I love both Diet Coke and Tom Colicchio, but I'm not sure how to feel about last night's Diet Coke commercial with Colicchio that played during the Oscars. It probably wasn't aided by being associated with, in my mind, the scary musical numbers and shots of Zac Efron that last night's ceremony featured. While Tom looks good and does a good enough acting job in the commercial challenge, something about the commercial looks a bit cheap, and the other actors in it perform oddly. Some are proposing that Colicchio's eye roll at the overly complicated, heavily wired food shown in the spot is actually a dig at Grant Achatz and Alinea. Oh heavens, that would be nasty after Achatz appeared on Top Chef this season.What worries me for Tommy boy is how the spot feels like all those cheesy American Express commercials with various leader-in-their-profession providing some sort of banal, vaguely philosophical voiceover. Wonder where our Diet Coke QuickFire challenge is.

Oh, man, they pack a protein punch for sure, but I didn't much care for the texture or taste. I would try another tiny taste in a spicy peanut stew.

The Early Word -- Marfa

POST:
When I heard that newly opened Marfa was attempting a chicken fried steak, I waited a respectful two weeks then hopped on my bike and peddled furiously over there. ??????????? Named after a small town on the high desert plains in West Texas that turned almost overnight from a dust bowl into an art center (see the reason here on Wikipedia), the restaurant recently replaced Waikiki Wally's, an East Village cocktail lounge near Houston Street. The décor is spare, with a wainscoted wall treatment of industrial green below and crème above, looking as if a thousand drunken souls had rubbed up against it while stumbling to the bathroom. The pair of rooms looks like a set from Orson Welles' Touch of Evil. Despite web reports of the place being mobbed with kids hoisting PBRs and knocking back shots, the place was nearly empty and the waitstaff milled around expectantly. ??????????? I plopped myself down at the bar and ordered the signature cocktail, something called a Marfita. It wasn't bad, tasting and looking like a Cosmo that someone had mistakenly dumped tequila into. Without further ado, I ordered the chicken fried steak ($16). It arrived on a platter with some mashed potatoes and purple coleslaw. An eddy of pepper-shot white gravy covered the steak, which was really two steaks piled on top of each other. Now, in Texas, a chicken fried steak is a very tough cut of meat sliced thin and tenderized with a tenderizing hammer, before being breaded and fried like fried chicken. Hence the name. Marfa's was perfect in every way. The oniony slaw was slammin', too. I rose from the bar a couple of pounds heavier, vowing to return and check out the rest of the curious menu, which contained other Texas-themed dishes (spice-rubbed ribs, chili, Tex-Mex tacos, fried chicken); some things you wouldn't find in Texas (fish tacos, salmon cakes, avocado-and-mango salad); and some just plain weird things intended to tap into the playful culinary zeitgeist (chorizo corn dogs, mac and cheese served on spoons, vegetable pot pie). ??????????? I returned a couple of days later with a friend, prepared to chow down in a big way. Once again, the place was almost completely empty, and a waitress seized us like a drowning man grabs a piece of flotsam. She announced that the restaurant was not serving the regular menu, but offering a $20.99 prix fix consisting of three courses. Didn't sound like a bad deal so we forged ahead. Though it only offered four or so choices each for appetizer and entrée, most of the choices were on the regular menu. ??????????? I don't want to belabor you with the details, but aside from the mac and cheese and coleslaw (both of which were great), most of the food was memorably awful. The dry rubbed ribs were just that - dry as a bone and tasting like they'd been reheated a couple of times already. It was with difficulty that we peeled off the pellicle of spices to get at meat moist enough to chew. The fried chicken was appropriately tender, but way too salty. The skin, moreover, was pale yellow and floppy underneath the brown crust, suggesting that it had been extensively boiled before being fried. The so-called truck stop sundae was a hash of old meat and baked beans of the Boston variety from a can (no pintos!), surmounted by the same slaw. Only the spiced and grilled shrimp were up to the standard of that chicken fried steak. ??????????? At some point a bevy of Asian drag queens blew into the space from a concealed entranceway at the rear of the room. "That reminds me," my dining companion noted, "this place is related to Lucky Cheng's, and there's a common party room in the basement." 101 East 2nd Street, 212-673-8908

Vegetarian Delights of NYC -- Boreks
AUTHOR:
Robert Sietsema
DATE:
2009-02-22 15:50:00
POST:
Herein begins a new series?highlighting the city's best vegetarian dishes. Spinach borek at Gazala Place, along with a side of the marvelous smoky babaganoush, laked with?green olive oil?(click to enjoy). The flaky pies variously called boureka, bureks, or boreks originated in Turkey and were transmitted across the Middle East and the Balkans by the Ottoman Empire several centuries ago. These pies take many forms, from the spare-tire shape of the outsize Albanian product, to the doughy turnovers of the Russians, to the Druse version pictured above. Druse are an ethnic minority in Lebanon, and the Hell's Kitchen restaurant?Gazala Place ably represents the cuisine, which includes dishes slightly different than you may have had in Middle Eastern restaurants before, with plenty of vegetarian choices on the menu. Their take on the borek, for example, is a humpy, bagel-shaped pastry with a crust much finer and flakier than filo -- it almost distintegrates upon touching it. Inside find a filling of crumbly white cheese and spinach, and the top of the pastry is nicely decorated with nigella seeds. There's nothing quite like it in town, and it's not on the menu, but you can spot them?on the counter next to the door as you come in. They're utterly delicious. 709 Ninth Avenue, 212-245-0709

Incredibly Cheap Eats -- Whiting on Whole Wheat

The scrumptious whiting sandwich at Dolphin (presumably, no dolphins were harmed) In Uptown Manhattan the fish sandwich rules as a cheap tuck-in. And one of the best places to get them is in the seafood markets usually run by Koreans. These vertical operations fry up whatever filets they have on hand, and load the sandwich up with them. This beauty costs only $5, and was enough for two to satisfyingly share. The filets are crisp and hot, the tartar so thick that even a Frenchman would love it. And the whole wheat bread is, well, whole wheat?bread, destined to scrape the goo from your insides as the sandwich is being digested.

What's in a Name?

POST:
Ten years ago it was called New Manpole Restaurant, and I became a regular. It was fun telling my pals that I was hitting the New Manpole that evening, but the cheap Chinese charcuterie alone made it a great place to go. Next, in a head-scratching switch, it adopted the name New Restaurant, which resulted in a kind of "Whose on First?" sort of humor: "Where are we going tonight?" they'd say. "To the New Restaurant," I'd say. "Which new restaurant?" they'd reply. Improving on the new name, the signage shifted again a couple years later to the seemingly redundant New New Restaurant, maybe because a single "New" was not only unremarkable, but untrademarkable. Just last year a fourth name appeared: Hong Wong Restaurant. With it came an insignia that looked like bats dressed in suits, complete with vests and neckties. Now, it's common for Chinese restaurants in their early stages to be unable to come up with a catchy English name. Most often, the name on the awning is probably the same as the name on the business licenses, as in the example of Food Sing 88 Corp., one of Chinatown's finer pulled-noodle establishments. Meanwhile, I'm still trying to figure out what "manpole" means in the Chinese restaurant context. I haven't yet succeeded, but I'm getting close: a thrift store across the street hung out an awning that says HK Manpolo, and I'm pretty sure "HK" refers to Hong Kong. Hong Wong Restaurant, 300 Grand Street, 212-925-1662

Strange Snacks of the World -- Salchipapas
AUTHOR:
Robert Sietsema
DATE:
2009-02-19 12:18:00
POST:
Let's forget about foie gras for a moment and dig into a big plate of salchipapas. Like the name?("sausage-potatoes") says, this snack is a toss of french fries and baby hot dogs. The hot dogs have been sliced diagonally, and assume a comically indented shape when they're cooked in hot fat with french fries at the same time. And therein lies some of salchipapas' specialness -- the flavors swap off between the two foodstuffs, as the frank fat renders, seeps into the deep fat, and is thereby transmitted to the very core of the admittedly inferior-on-their-own french fries. Not into them yet? Well, how about the boiled egg on top? Doesn't that make the assemblage more proteinaceously delicious? As a further boost into the ranks of snacking excellence, a thick milky green hot sauce comes on the side, into which you will be unable to prevent yourself from dipping each and every fry. Served in a paper cone, salchipapas are a street snack in Ecuador and Peru, but it's also sometimes seen in Columbia and Central American countries. Find the above example at La Cuarta, a new Peruvian restaurant in Sunset Park. 782 Fourth Avenue, Brooklyn, 718-369-4694 ?

I love salchipapas and was recently looking for sausage/fry combos from other cultures. Luckily, the wiener/fries pizza in Brooklyn Heights is accessible (though scary, I'll admit). I don't know when I'll be able to try the Korean fry dog. http://www.goodiesfirst.com/2009/02/two-great-tastes-that-taste-great-together.html

COMMENT CONTENT
In reply to Tomatocake: Sue Torres' place didn't make Nixtamal which is the traditional infusion of Lime from Limestone(traditionally and historically the chosen rock/stone used to grind corn in Mexican Villages) I've had both and Nixtamal is the better way to go for taste and authenticity. We tried Tortilleria Nixtamal and were blown away by the freshness, taste, proud family service, the neighborhood atmoshphere and quick ease to travel there. I have cancer and I have to be careful with what I eat, Nixtamal has all organic, preservative free and fresh produce, perfect for the health conscious and for those with wheat aleergies like my sister. Tortilleria Nixtamal also sells massa by the pound and of course they supply to restaurants concerned with freshness and flavor. There are so many things recipes for those delightful fresh tortillas that I now have a daily stop at Nixtamal on the way home for supper. The French go daily for their bread and I do for my tortillas, I love it! Now everyone I know loves it too.

Is Yelp Cooking Its Reviews?
AUTHOR:
Robert Sietsema
DATE:
2009-02-18 10:22:00
POST:
Our former sister publication, the East Bay Express, ran an incendiary story today, reporting how the consumer restaurant review site yelp.com may be shaking down restaurants by offering to alter the reviews that appear in its restaurant listings -- for $299 per month.?The alteration takes the form of pushing good reviews to the top of the list, canceling bad reviews, and even creating enthusiastic reviews out of whole cloth, so that a casual reader stumbling on the listing during a Google or Yelp search will see nothing but a flood of puff-piece descriptions. Read the story and then explore yelp.com a bit. I went right to Elmhurst, and the priority of listings that I got seemed a little screwy. Singa's Famous Pizza Inc. appeared right at the top of the list, before many much finer restaurants, and the enthusiastic string of reviews really was unbelievable. It's just a pizza parlor after all, and one that doesn't even make the radar at sites like chowhound.com. Check out yelp.com and see if you think the reviews have been cooked.

The Other, Really White Meat
AUTHOR:

POST:
The National Pork Board, an organization responsible for hyping pork (as if pork needed any promotion),?is to blame for the painful slogan "The Other White Meat." For years, I've pondered that slogan. So what then is "The?Original White Meat"? You might be tempted to say chicken, but then chicken isn't really meat, is it? It's poultry. Well, what might be an answer to that question recently landed in my email inbox, in the form of a proud announcement by the National Pork Board of a new Consumer Advisory Council, including such luminaries as Chicago's excellent gringo Mexican chef Rick Bayless, and Michael Giletto, a Jersey guy who cooks at a country club, and whose claim-to-fame seems to be that he assisted Cat Cora on Iron Chef America. Good going, dude! But as I ran my eye over the committee members (Who must be getting paid plenty for their advisory superpowers, judging by their happy pusses!), I couldn't help but notice that the august pork board hadn't managed to find any, shall we say, participants of color. C'mon guys! Black folks and other non-Caucasoids were appreciating pork way before you got the idea to form a National Pork Board. Maybe you think of homo sapiens as "The Other White Meat."

Lake Winnebago Sturgeon Season Off to a Fast, Tragic Start

POST:
 Champion sturgeon caught in Lake Winnebago, Wisconsin last year by Ed "Al" Blatz measured 78 inches and weighed a whopping 172 pounds (click to enlarge) The sturgeon season on Wisconsin's Lake Winnebago got off to a fast and tragic start on Saturday according to the?Milwaukee Journal Sentinel,?as a pair died when their truck crashed through the ice near an ice crack that originated in Quinney,Wisconsin. A third man fell through the ice, which was obscured by soupy conditions in the 50 degree heat. Many vehicles drive out onto the ice each winter, which is 18 to 28 inches thick. Ice roads are maintained by local fishing clubs, but treacherous cracks often appear.  The sturgeon fishing is done with multi-pronged spears through holes in the ice, and the catch is carefully controlled by the State of Wisconsin to preserve the sturgeon population in the lake. Around 10,000 licenses are granted per year, and at the start of this year's two-week season this last Satruday, over 6000?fishing shacks appeared on the ice. The lake is the state's largest, running from Fond du Lac at its southern tip to?Appleton at the northern edge, a distance of 30 miles. Caught fish are cut up into sturgeon steaks and frozen, and the eggs are preserved as caviar. (I have a bottle in my freezer is anyone wants to try it.)

Incredibly Cheap Eats -- Street Tamales
AUTHOR:
Robert Sietsema
DATE:
2009-02-15 9:23:00
POST:
A tale of two tamales, one red and one green (click to explode) Not sure how when it happened, but East Harlem's 116th Street has become of paradise of Latin street vending. At $2 for two, the tamale meal you see above constitutes one of the city's most formidable Incredibly Cheap Eats. Purchased between 3rd and Lexingon Avenues, the tamales come wrapped in corn husks and?stuffed with silky chicken; the one at the top features a punchy salsa verde based on tomatillos and fresh green chiles, while the bottom?is made with dried red chiles, and is consequently more spicy. On the north side of the street midblock, you'll find two or three ladies selling tamales, and assorted other Mexican snacks. Their vending stations are often elaborate affairs employing two or three other people besides the tamale lady, and?vending some viands far less familiar than the tamales. At one station, a young man and woman had a?tin-windproofing contraption set up around a small charcoal hibachi; they seemed to be grilling chorizo for tacos that also came stuffed with rice, which may originate in Morelos.   Mystery snack of the day But the most unusual item seen that day was a masa pancake folded into a flat triangle over a filling of chile-flecked refried beans, which came with either red or green sauces, that the short vendor, folded into her blanket and speaking little English or Spanish, applied to the construction from a little plastic cup. She accepted a dollar as payment, but I could tell from the glint in her eye that she probably usually sold this snack for less. It was wonderful, and I've never quite seen anything like it before. The woman nodded when I referred to it as a pupusa, but I'm pretty sure she wasn't from Central America. More like Peru. Does anyone know what this snack is called and where it comes from? ?

Weekend Special -- Cookbook Corner
AUTHOR:
Robert Sietsema
DATE:
2009-02-14 12:21:00
POST:
This weekend Fork in the Road is kicking off a new series focusing on cookbooks and other food-related volumes that have appeared in our in-boxes recently. Ratio: the Simple Codes Behind the Craft of Everyday Cooking, by Michael Ruhlman (New York: Simon & Schuster, 2009), 231 pages, $26, pub date: April 2009 This is a book for brainy cooks. It says it isn't a cookbook, and the slender size of the volume seems to bear that out. Instead, it's a series of formulae intended to express the essence of recipes. For example, pie dough requires flour, fat, and water in the ratio 3-2-1. Yes, there are some recipes, too, including ones for chicken stock and veal stock, both much more complicated than the ones I use myself, and plenty of dessert recipes, for angel food cake, caramel sauce, etc., but all illustrative of his ratio approach to cooking. Ruhlman has already written a dozen books, including The Making of a Chef and The French Laundry Cookbook. The drawback of the volume is that it's completely retrograde in its purview - everything seems to be French (or at least Franco-American) in its underpinnings, as if the myriad cuisines of the world did not exist. Beef: And Other Bovine Matters, by John Torode (Newtown, CT: The Taunton Press, 2009), 256 pages, $34.95, pub date: Feburary 2009 For anyone you know obsessed with beef, this is a must-have volume. It functions as an atlas of beef (including descriptions of breeds and cuts), a lavishly illustrated coffee table book that your beef-loving friends can page through as they wait for their hamburgers to be done, and a recipe book. If the book (originally published last year in England) has a vice, it lies in its Anglophilia (use of tallow in dessert recipes for plum pudding and mince meat, things that Yanks have long forgotten; main course recipes for steak and kidney pie and Cornish pasties, etc.) The chef tries hard to counter that with recipes for Indonesian rendang, Sicilian arancini, and, of course, lots and lots of French recipes adapted for English tastes. The book still might be called The Roast Beef of Olde England. Kneadlessly Simple: Fabulous, Fuss-Free, No-Knead Breads, by Nancy Baggett (Hoboken, NJ: Wiley, 2009), 210 pages, $24.95, pub date: February 2, 2009 The technique of using less yeast, not kneading the dough, and then letting it sit for a long, long time has been around for a while, espoused by such oven luminaries as Jim Lahey and Nancy Silverton. This volume seeks to popularize the use of this technique, from traditional "Old World" breads (French walnut, Swedish rye, Scottish oat); to sweet, yeast-risen dessert breads; to newfangled concoctions like brown and wild-rice crunch bread. Some of the recipes come off a little weird, but this is more or a less a volume for the beginning baker, and its strengths like in the wild-ass breadth of the recipes. There's even a section on pizzas that includes a sauce recipe, obviating the need for a pizza cook book.

Click to make this beautiful pastry life size! Nothing compares with the old-world goodness of Teutonic pastries--well, nothing I can think of at this moment. This $1.75 morsel from Greenpoint's distinguished Peter Pan Bakery features a thick white pudding poised between custard and cheesecake, generously flooded with canned berries so deep in goo that if you turn it upside down so the filling falls out it would land with a flop on the ground, quiver, and then assume exactly the same shape. With freehand frosting squiggles applied by some budding Rauschenberg or Pollock, this treat is today's Gutbomb Extraordinaire. 727 Manhattan Avenue, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, 718-389-3676

Choice Eats Preview: Peppa's Jerk Chicken
AUTHOR:
DATE:
2009-02-13 6:00:00
POST:
On a recent Sunday I appeared at a Grove Street party with two aluminum tubs of chicken, nearly identical in appearance. I'd squirted Scotch bonnet sauce in the corner of each, as I warned the guests. Let me note that Danny's homemade sauce is a little thicker, with a yellowish cast, while Peppa's is thinner and more vinegary, like the original sauce at Danny and Pepper. As the guests tore into the two tubs, I watched anxiously and polled them on their opinions. "I like Peppa's better; it's richer and saltier," said Ruth. Indeed, the chicken coating flaunted a faint hint of Worcestershire. At first Nick disagreed with her, but finally drifted into the Peppa camp. Sookie preferred Danny's for its milder taste, then had the misfortune of picking up one of the pieces that had touched the sauce. She spent the rest of the party fanning her mouth. The 10 guests, including myself, preferred Peppa's by a margin of 7-3.

Keep the Tip -- Advice to Restaurateurs II
AUTHOR:
Robert Sietsema
DATE:
2009-02-12 20:25:00
POST:
In the previous installment, I bitched about two anti-consumer practices - slotting and herding - that upscale restaurants have developed to squeeze the maximum cash out of consumers. In a down-market economy, these practices must cease if restaurants hope to attract and keep diners, because most consumers find them an extreme turn-off. Diner loyalty and the repeat patronage it represents is the key to future restaurant health. No longer will restaurants want to attract a glittering crowd who hop from new place to new place garnering mentions in glossy publications and on websites, and then never returning. Loyal diners must be wooed and won one diner at a time if upscale places want to stay in business. Following are some diner-friendly principles that restaurants should adopt. Part 2: Freebies and Wine Deals FREEBIES There's nothing nicer than an amuse. Chefs in the fanciest places have used them forever, little morsels delivered for free at the onset of a meal. This practice should be extended to places below the highest tier of white-tablecloth restaurants. It doesn't have to be much - a few French fries with a flavored dip, a bowl of consommé with a small shellfish in the bottom, a miniature serving of vegetable sorbet frozen in a funny ice cube tray from IKEA - it should be tasty and whimsical. Not only does it jump-start the appetite, it makes the diner feel special and pampered. WINE DEALS For too long the city's wine lists have been absurdly skewed toward the higher end. Even in modest bistros, I often find only a couple of bottles in the $30 to $40 range, while the upper end climbs to $200 or more. Typically, the majority of the bottles will top $50. It means that I, as a wine enthusiast, will look at the list and find only a single bottle that I can afford and am interested in. This causes diners to order one bottle for three or four people, and then nurse their drinks throughout the meal, imbibing in small sips. The opposite is true in Europe. There, the wine markups are very low, 20 to 50 percent compared with 200 percent or more here. There, one drinks copiously and well, and it's common for diners to drink one bottle per patron in the course of a meal. I contend that, if restaurants put many more choices at the lower end of the wine list, and marked the bottles up less, the diners would drink more and leave the restaurant feeling more contented, rather than feeling screwed. Immediately, the restaurants would see more profit by selling lots more wine. In the long run, patrons would return and become regulars because they had a much better wine-drinking experience. Special wine deals should be offered, based on bargains the sommelier finds. For example, a couple of more-expensive bottles should be offered every evening at half price (the way Perry Street currently does at lunch). In addition, every restaurant should offer carafes of cheaper house wine - there's nothing wrong with unaged jug wine, providing it's carefully selected.

East Coast Oysters vs. West Coast Oysters, Bout One
AUTHOR:
Robert Sietsema
DATE:

POST:
"In this corner, defending the honor of East Coast oysters," the ringmaster intoned, "are Beaver Tails from Rhode Island, and Fire Islands from Long Island." "And in that corner," he continued, gesturing at the opposite corner, "are Meximotos from Mexico's Baja peninsula, and Phantom Creeks from British Columbia." ? "Ha," I snorted to my companions. "It figures that the West Coast oysters would both be from outside the United States." The "ring" was actually a square table with a red-checked cloth, and in the center sat a dozen shucked oysters on ice. The venue was the city's most distinguished purveyor of raw oysters, Grand Central's Oyster Bar. And my companions and I were indulging in a little eating game we like to call Oyster Smackdown. In this case, we'd pitted two types from each coast against each other to find out which coast would emerge the victor. The oysters threw themselves into the middle of the ring, and the battle was joined. In a split decision,?the West Coast's Phantom Islands won the contest, so the jeweled belt, at least temporarily, goes to Canada. In a postgame wrap-up, the shells still glistening empty before us, and our beers nearly finished, we examined our tasting notes. The Beavertails -- filthy jokes notwithstanding -- were plump and pendulous, with a pronounced briny taste. They were our second favorite of the evening. The Fire Islands seemed more lumpy and rustic, and their?misshapen shells even suggested a sort of unfinished quality.?Meximotos were the odd men out, lying flat and black-edged against their shells, with a clean flavor but also a too-faint one. Phantom Islands burst with flavor, clear and cold and not very saline, with a texture firmer than the other varieties. Two of the three of us declared Phantom Islands the best, while one picked Beavertails. Phantom Islands were thus certified to progress to the next level of?competition.

Choice Eats Preview: Braai
AUTHOR:
DATE:
2009-02-12 6:00:00
POST:
As an addition to New York's barbecue scene--Asian, Texan, Argentinean, et. al--Braai seems to be unique. As far as I can tell, it's the only Manhattan restaurant that focuses on South African 'cue. (Madiba, in Brooklyn, has a few braai-ed dishes.) With a faux-thatched roof, rough wood, and animal prints everywhere, the restaurant flirts with theme-park-dom, but you can't blame them for working what they've got. The chef (or braai master), Armando Mart, grills over ysterhout wood, which comes from an African olive tree. (Hira prefers to simply call it "braai wood.") The results are generally very good, as long as you stick with the meat--this is not the place to bring your new vegetarian girlfriend.

There's also another place like this on the same block up the street toward Union St. It seems to be more chinese, no french fries and the soup is seaweed.

COMMENT CONTENT
The origin of the four-over-rice-plus-soup idea is not the Fujianese places in Manhattan's Chinatown. Lunch is sold in this manner in many parts of China, where it's just called 'box lunch' (hefan in mandarin) because they usually serve it in a styrofoam box that you can either take away or eat on the premise. Several larger restaurants in Flushing also offer lunch in this style, and their's is generally much better than that of the small places -- at the same price. Although they might not advertise in English, you can identify these larger restaurants by the buffet table near the door around lunch time. One is on the corner of 40th Road and Main.

The city's only Surinamese-Indonesian restaurant reflects the activities of Dutch colonialists in both Souheast Asia and South America during the 19th century. Warung Kario is a hawker stall turned diner,?started by immigrants from the Indonesian community of Suriname, on the northeast coast of South America.?Here are some pix of the fascinating (and good!) food served there. See full review?for an enhanced gloss on the dishes. Baka bana are battered and fried sweet plantains, served with a spicy and chunky peanut sauce.? Teloh is a meal of fried cassava with salt cod and eggplant stew, garnished with a dried fish sambal, pickled purple onions, and cukes.? Goedangan is a vegetarian's delight: a salad of sprouts, green yard beans, and boiled eggs with a spicy coconut dressing. Bamie is a set meal featuring?lo mein drenched in salty palm syrup (standing in for soy sauce) and spice-braised chicken--not to be missed.

Keep the Tip -- Advice to Restaurateurs
AUTHOR:
Robert Sietsema
DATE:
2009-02-10 10:50:00
POST:
No doubt the restaurant climate in the city is changing as the economy spirals downward. While a few upscale restaurants (I'm talking about places that expect $50 or more per diner) still enjoy full capacity, many yawn half-empty, even on weekend evenings. Here begins a new series on restaurant sustainability -- how to be the restaurant that's full rather than empty. To do this, restaurateurs must elimate those practices that put diners at a disadvantage and make them not want to return. The successful restaurant of the future will win over diners one by one, by creating an environment in which customers feel like pampered guests rather than shark's prey. To get the ball rolling, here are a couple of my pet peeves about expensive restaurants, practices that should be elimated, whether initiated by staff or official restaurant policy. Part 1: Slotting and Herding THE PROBLEM: We've all had the experience - you call to make a reservation for a week hence. A soothing voice on the other end inquires, "What time would you like?" Seven o'clock, you reply, falling for the bait. "I'm so sorry," the voice coos, "but that time is fully committed." It goes on: "But we have a 5:45." Now, 5:45 is going to be a stretch; only young children and the elderly dine at that hour by choice. Comes the designated time you and your date arrive promptly to find the restaurant empty, the black-clad staff standing around fidgeting. Well, you ruefully observe, at least I managed to get a reservation at this wildly popular spot. But the hour of 7 rolls around, then 8, and, donning your coat to leave, you note that the joint is still half empty -- meaning that you could have been accommodated at the requested hour. Congratulations! You've been slotted - the practice of offering absurd reservation times in an attempt to wedge as many hypothetical seatings into an evening as possible. And it's often done even when there's no chance the restaurant will be packed. THE SOLUTION: Go back to the old system. Allow customers to make reservations for the times they want. Maybe you won't be able to wedge as many reservations onto the books, but the customers will be happier, spend more, and be prone to return. They'll also be more prone to actually showing up. THE PROBLEM: Abuses at the greeter's podium abound. Another is something I call bar herding. You arrive on time for your reservation to find a room with plenty of unclaimed tables, attractively set with white napery, wine glasses gleaming. Yet, instead of seating you promptly, the hostess says something like, "I'm sorry, your table is not quite ready yet. Could you please wait a moment," gesturing toward a pair of empty bar stools. This is a crass attempt to jump-start your liquor consumption, adding a couple of $10 cocktails, plus tax and tip, to the overall tab. THE SOLUTION: When customers arrive, assume they want to be seated immediately, and don't try to herd them to the bar. Once seated, if they feel like a cocktail, they'll order one.

I'm glad Sean is trying it and glad I did too. My husband and I tried variations on the food-stamp diet for three months. The planning was the killer, but I figured it out. In fact, we wound up enjoying the diet so much that we've pretty much stayed on it. See what we're doing at CookforGood.com. I've put together the shopping lists, menu plans, and recipes that will let you eat for $1.25 a meal using "regular" products and only $1.78 a meal using "green" ones (mostly organic, sustainable, and kindly raised). That's shopping in Raleigh, North Carolina, not Manhattan, but it IS in prices from January 2009. We found that eating this way resulted in the Seven Lively Savings, including helping to save the planet by reducing your carbon footprint.

Very stupid and useless. There is no reason for anyone to do this that does not have to. Is there some higher purpose for this? A sense of White guilt maybe - there shouldn't be. Poor people and welfare bunnies need to learn - you are not owed anything. There are generous welfare benefits in America that people abuse all the time. Yeah I said generous - because I'd let you starve in the streets.

Dear Sean, We appreciate your going through the food stamp experience. Some 3 years ago my husband and I and our small child went through the food stamp process. We could not believe that we had reached a point of not being able to reach the mortgage barely able to make ends meet re utilities etc. , cc bills etc. let's just forget about luxuries such as health insurance etc .... but our refrigerator was always full - long gone are those few months. We continue to struggle but have managed to reach a point when we can just about make ends meet. No food stamps any more, we just don't quite qualify any more. I certainly am not in a position to spend on food what we did when we received that particular benefit. I stated to my husband just the other day: we pay our minimal bills but the fridge is always empty, we live on potates, pulses, eggs and the odd bits of chicken. Good luck with your project,as far as I am concerned there are many of us who must spend less on food per day at $6.00 per individual. I know that as we endevor to meet our obligations we try to live on a budget of %50.00 - $60.00 maximum per week for food for 3 people. The food stamps have gone for us but at least we had plenty of food at that time. By the way food is food but why does the benefit not cover bare essentials like washing liquid or toilet tissue etc ... Europeans I spoke to were so astonished at this - you can buy all the food you want but you cannot wash your clothes?   Sincerely, JMKL

Choice Eats Preview: Cheburechnaya
AUTHOR:
DATE:
2009-02-9 6:00:00
POST:
While most places offer three or four types of kebabs, the Cheburechnaya menu lists 23. Old standards such as ground-beef lula, chicken wing, lamb sweetbreads, and chunk lamb, priced from $1.75 to $2.50, are completely up to snuff, but lamb rib is the variety I wouldn't give up if forced to pick only one thing to eat on a desert island. The glass-front refrigerated meat case tempts you with several other frankly odd choices, including lamb testicles, which turn out to be the bulkier, paler, and more rubbery testicles of a full-grown ram, cut into swatches. Health considerations may tempt you to forgo the kebab called "lamb fat," but then you'd miss one of the most interesting taste sensations since Mario Batali put lardo on pizza. Made with the much prized fat from the lamb's buttocks, on which all true Uzbek cooking depends, the kebab presents four crisp and delicious morsels that you can decadently eat by themselves or, more prudently, enfold in a hunk of non or poise on a good-sized piece of noni toki.

Ice Cream -- Hold the Dairy
AUTHOR:

POST:
 If you thought this was conventional gelato, you'd be wrong New to the East Village: an all vegan "ice cream" shop. The display mimics, not a Coldstone or a Baskin-Robbins, but one of the gelato shops that have popped up over the last couple of years. The place is called Stogo, and is the brainchild of Malcolm Stogo of ice cream impresarios Malcolm Stogo Associates, which usually has no problem with dairy products in ice cream. The product is based on either soy derivatives or coconut milk, and each tub is decorated, Italian-style, with squiggles of chocolate, scatters of nuts, or tidbits of fruit to telegraph the flavor in the tub. ? Could the product be mistaken for ice cream by a blindfolded taster? In?a few?cases, the answer would be yes.?Flavors run from the conventional (chocolate, strawberry, peach) to the truly weird (pomegranate chocolate chip, vanilla goji berry crunch). We particularly liked the soft serve not featured in the display case, which had a creamy texture and a zippy flavor. The berry soft serve?knocked us out, and the chocolate wasn't bad, either. There's a cavalcade of toppings, too, including goji berries, dark chocolate chips, almonds, tiny marshmallows, and, yes, rainbow sprinkles. ? Stogo also sells gluten-free cupcakes, raw chocolates, and fair-trade coffee -- without cream, of course. 159 Second Avenue (entrance on 10th Street), 212-677-2301 ?

To be honest there isn’t much to say about my workouts this week. Much like last week, they were virtually non-existent due to my triceps injury. I tested it yesterday and am 98% healthy, so I will be back on track and lifting again. The only real workout I had was helping my brother move to a new place last Saturday.

Phanton Smell Identified

POST:
NY1 ran a report this morning identifying the phantom smell that arrives from the west once or twice a year in Manhattan (yesterday, in particular), smelling like maple syrup being poured over hot pancakes. Apparently, it comes from a North Bergen, New Jersey?flavor house called Frutarom, and a spokesperson for the company -- founded in 1933 to provide flavorings and scents for the food industry -- says it represents the odor produced by processing the Middle Eastern spice fenugreek into?(you guessed it!) artificial maple flavoring. Some find the odor exhilarating, but most describe it as nauseating.?

Choice Eats Preview: Tiffin Wallah

POST:
The genius of Tiffin Wallah lies in its delivery of the three great vegetarian cuisines of India--Gujarati, the fleshless half of Punjabi, and southern Indian. As an added advantage, the food is significantly fresher than at most Indian spots, because the cooks have a predilection for whipping things up on the spot rather than stockpiling them on a steam table. The menu is strictly vegetarian, partly vegan, and kosher too. Its centerpiece is four $14 set meals--including bread, rice, curries, and condiments--that take the worry out of deciphering the complicated menu. All set meals are served dramatically on thalis, compartmentalized metal trays that will remind you of TV dinners (only good).

Dispatch from the Bacon and Bourbon Expo
AUTHOR:

POST:
The expo on the second floor of the Astor Center seems to shimmer in the cold night air (click to enlarge). Online it was a billed almost like a class, but it felt more like a trade show once I'd arrived at the Bacon and Bourbon Expo early Thursday evening. On the main floor, whiskey exhibitors offered tastes of two or three distinguished distilled spirits, and fanciers who'd paid $45 a ticket stood around in little knots swirling the liquid criticallly in their mouths. Sausages that looked like Slim Jims, cubes of cheddar cheese, and snatches of bread provided sole sustenance. ? Pouring another round of 23-year-old rye whiskey At a signal from a disembodied voice overhead, attendees filed into an amphitheater, then stood along the walls, or sat in comfy swivel chairs that ran along curving counters in tiers. Between pairs of seats were installed bar sinks with goose-neck spigots, and each seat also had knee-height dispensers providing paper towels and facial tissues. It was like the meeting hall of a governing council on a distant planet. ? Josh reads his poem. ? Editor of The Feedbag, bon vivant, and meat expert Josh Ozersky (known familiarly to his friends as "Mr. Cutlets") held forth to a rapt audience on the merits of various smoking techniques and raw materials in the production of bacon. But first, he read a poem about bacon that he wrote in perfect heroic couplets, to the crowd's ringing applause: Bacon, King of Meats: The food all men desire Perfumed by the aromas of the slowly smoldering fires We gather in your honor, with bourbon or with beer Two hundred souls collected for the thing they hold most dear May your meat be bathed in smoke of one thousand fragrant logs Created from the belly of obese and happy hogs Redolent of hickory, with a cure as sweet as sin You go places gastronomical, no sausage has ever been All hail the mighty bacon! Whose scent inspires longing Whose taste sets hearts afire and empty stomachs gnawing Most precious of necessities, most beloved of all treats From China to Peru, the undisputed King of Meats. The couplets struck me as midway between Robert Burns and Evelyn Waugh, as I thoughtfully chewed a piece of boar bacon. Ozersky went on to prescribe the correct way to cook bacon (in an oven for 15 minutes), painted a thumbnail history of bacon, passed around samples of bacon, and eventually turned the floor over to Scott Smith from R.U.B., who demonstrated how to make bacon, trimming and rubbing a belly with salt, sugar, and black pepper. Thick slices of Smith's bacon were then distributed, right after being fried in hot lard. It was one of the evening's highlights. Which slice should I pick? Whiskeys included: Bernheim Original Wheat Whiskey, 90 proof Buffalo Trace, Eagle Rare, Evan Williams Single Barrel Bourbon Vintage 1999, Hudson Single Malt, Hudson Baby Bourbon, Hudson Four Grain Bourbon, Hudson Manhattan Rye, Hudson New York Corn Whiskey, Parker's Heritage 2nd Edition, 27 year Old Rittenhouse Rye 100 proof, Rittenhouse Very Rare 23 Year Old 100 proof Rye, Wild Turkey.

You would have been surprised, Joe, how little the gout slowed him down. Maybe it's just a publicity stunt (haha, just kidding). I should have tromped on his foot to find out! He did seem to be wearing some rather large and unflattering shoes, but I assumed he'd made them out of pigskin or something...

ABSOLUTELY....I have been a TC fan from season one and still think Howard is the best.... But this obivous "reality TV" crap with Leah is just awful.... Face it TC...she can't cook...with the big boys / girls and Jamie could... At least realize that Jamie is a WAY BETTER chef...who cares if Hosea and Leah are hooking up / not hooking up... Good TV should not stand in the way of who is the better Chef...besides Leah should already be gone...

Please, they can say it all they want- but Leah's been weak for WEEKS... I still don't understand how Carla is left there, either. Big deal, she had a lucky week. Jamie is a better chef than both of them. Defend all you want- Jamie's elimination was bogus.

I've made no secret of my admiration for B & H Deli, a culinary gem in the East Village that consists of a lunch counter, a few tiny tables, and a crew of irascible waiters (years ago, there was a legendary waiter named Dave). A recurring diet plan of mine consists of eating soup there every day; indeed the place is most famous for its vegetarian soups served with wonderful challah made on the premises. B & H is one of the few Jewish dairy restaurants left in town, and also represents one of the last vestiges of the days when Second Avenue in the East Village was known as the Jewish Broadway. (It's meat-bearing counterpart was the Second Avenue Deli, which was emblazoned with mementos of its theater days, a place that should have been protected by restaurant landmarking if ever there was one.) Anyway, instead of ordering soup the other day, I leafed through the menu until my eye fell on an unfamiliar entree in the Our Specials section of the menu, which also included blintzes and pierogi: potato knish with gravy, $3.25. Would it be a Coney Island square knish, or, the alternate formulation, the Yonah Schimmel style, streudel-type knish? All heads at the Formica counter swiveled as the waiter carried my prize in, looking like a puffy?British king's crown. It was?a gigantic mountain of pastry?smothered in brown mushroom gravy. Wow! What?a gutbomb, I thought. With some difficulty, I cleaved it with my sword butter knife, as my incredulous audience looked on. The crust was like a pie crust, but not quite as good, and the potato filling was nicely peppered, but lacked salt. The gravy was perfection, if you like gluey gravy. The function of this tuck-in is clearly to fill you up for the minimum amount of money, and I wondered if this knish architecture is unique to B & H. As I swiveled off the stool, I thought sadly to myself, "I'm never eating this again." 127 Second Avenue, 212-505-8065 ? ?

the producers clearly have a hand in Leah staying. she is a little lazy and has been consistently mediocre. neither she nor hosea are particularly interesting, so I say, who cares about the "romance plot"? It's ridiculous that Radhika, Jamie and the blond guy from Flordia (name?) who consistently produced inventive food are gone and Leah is still hanging around.

I agree wholeheartedly with the comments here. Jamie over Leah! No way. Leah is nowhere near Jamie's talent. Not to mention the fact that it was her who should have gone home in restaurant wars. Hosea WANTS to be Stefan but he's not. I believe he is talented but he does not have the number of years in cooking that Stefan has. He has a bright future for sure. So sad about Jamie.

Are you watching the same show/season I am? Because what I see in Jamie is an overly confident (read: totally insecure) chef with a limited number of weapons in her arsenal and a horrible attitude problem. Totally disingenuous, right down to her farewell speech.

Choice Eats Preview: Kampuchea Noodle Bar

POST:
Mark your calendars! The second annual Choice Eats event is scheduled for March 31, and tickets are selling fast!Tuesday March 31, 2009   6:30 - 9:30pmThe 69th Armory at Lexington Avenue68 Lexington Ave @ 26th Street, NYCGo here to read more and buy tickets. Like last year, we've invited restaurants based on the recommendations of our food writers, Robert Sietsema and Sarah DiGregorio. And to whet your appetite, here's a preview of one of the participants, Kampuchea Noodle Bar.This is what Sietsema had to say about the eatery in a 2007 review:A child of Cambodian refugees, chef Ratha Chau formerly worked as restaurant manager at Fleur de Sel. Despite his never cheffing before, his cooking skills are prodigious. As with its Fort Greene predecessor, Kampuchea Noodle Bar offers a menu that spans Southeast Asia. As the chef explained one evening, "Cambodians have a cuisine that borrows from all the countries around us due to our central location." Indeed, the best things on the menu are the sandwiches called num pang ($7 to $9), which resemble Vietnamese banh mi. The one called Kampuchea (the Khmer name for Cambodia) layers pork pâté, headcheese, and ground pork on a freshly toasted baguette. Less organ-oriented and almost as scrumptious, another features memorable pork meatballs. The sandwiches come slathered with a pink coconut concoction that's a dead ringer for Russian dressing. The same mayo recurs on the grilled corn ($6), a pair of sweet ears dusted with dried cheese, which seems more Mexican than Cambodian but is damn good nonetheless. There's an interesting papaya salad flavored with tiny dried shrimp rather than fish sauce, and a fantastic plate of homemade pickles--which you needn't order because a handful comes with most things on the menu. Read the rest of the review here.

You're right, it would be amazing drunk food, but Guerrero is open 9am-11pm everyday...so you'd have to get started early to end up there at the end of the night! But they do have specials on the weekends: pozole soup with shrimp and barbecued goat.

The kind of guys who flit from girl to girl, getting what they can but making no commitments. The kind of guys who never have any money of their own, but also try to make the lady pay. The kind of useless guys who swarm around a pretty single girl. And here is the meaning of the metaphor: Manga na are also insects, something like our water bugs, three or four inches long, with wings that really work. At night they swarm around the street lamps, and they pester people by flying into their faces. But in Thailand, the bugs are also a popular food, with a flavor that has been described by one rhapsodic taster as "one of the most haunting flavors I know, with an intense floral fragrance that reminds me of gewurtztraminer." The reason I'm telling you this is that I stumbled on a package of frozen mangda na in a Thai grocery recently and scooped them up. I won't tell you where I got them, because I'm not sure they're strictly legal, but if you track my recent reviews, you can probably figure it out.    Four pack of mangda na, $3.50. The package includes the imprecation, "Cook before serving." Next: I get some friends together for a fried mangda na party

Our Man Sietsema at Salumeria Rosi

POST:
 This week, Our Man Sietsema tastes his way through Cesare Casella's Salumeria Rosi--a charcuterie shop with cooked dishes as well. Our Man finds the charcuterie to be pretty good, but he saves most of his love for Casella's cooking. The salumeria serves Parmacotto products from Italy:But while Parmacotto's products are wholesome and tasty, they're also a bit boring if you're used to the quirky, local cured meats found throughout Italy.While the Parmacotto selections fail to dazzle, Our Man likes the small selection of domestic charcuterie, including the guanciale (cured pig jowl) from Chelsea's Salumeria Biellese. (This is an amazing place. If you haven't been, and you like charcuterie, you should call in sick and go now.)The cooking done at Salumeria Rosi follows from Casella's previous two restaurants (Beppe and Maremma), and Our Man calls it mostly "stunning." He finds the small serving of lasagna "unforgettable," and most of the other dishes also win superlative adjectives. Salumeria Rosi Parmacotto 283 Amsterdam Avenue 212-877-4800?

Bad Food Jokes and Riddles

POST:
It's that time of the month again - time for more bad food jokes and riddles, courtesy of a book I found in the trash, 101 Fast Funny Food Jokes by Phil Hirsch (New York: Scholastic Books, 1983). According to a commentator the last time I tried this, there are several other puerile joke books from the same author, including 101 Hamburger Jokes. It's so sad to see classic volumes go out of print and disappear from the face of the earth! But first, here are a couple of bad food jokes submitted by talented readers: Q: What did Sushi A say to Sushi B? A: Wasabi! (posted by dude) Q: Why do the French eat one egg for breakfast? A: Because one egg is enough ("un oeuf")! (posted by k/Jam) That last one was a little deep for the genre, but the following are not: What vegetable shouldn't be allowed to fight in Madison Square Garden? Spinach - it might get creamed! What has lots of teetch, but can't chew? A comb! What did the hamburger say to the pickle? You're dill-icious! What do they call it when two seeded bagels at Bagel Nosh decide to go steady? Poppy love! What are the best days of the week in Foodland? Fry-day and Sundae! Diner: What's that fly doing in my soup? Waiter: The backstroke! Foodland's Music Stars (and remember, this is 1983 talking): The Grapeful Dead The Peach Boys Hall and Oatesmeal Chopstyx Berry Manilow Jackson Brownie The Bean Gees Fleetwood Macintosh Bread Zeppelin

 This very funny version of Oedipus (funny and Oedipus don't often go together) was brought to my attention by my former boss at Chile Pepper magazine. It features a potato as Oedipus and a tomato as his sexy mom. You know how this ends. Surprisingly, not totally safe for work. See it on a bigger screen here.

Union Square Vegetable Peeler Man Dies

POST:
Video courtesy Jwindish on youtubeJoe Ades passed away on Sunday, at the age of 75. You might know him from the Union Square Greenmarket-- he was the dapper older fellow in a suit, perched on top of a crate, peeling carrots and potatoes at a rapid rate, and hawking the peelers in a charming (and convincing) manner. His spiel always drew a crowd, and involved phrases like "ladies and gentlemen, step right up," intoned in a booming British baritone. He learned how to hawk by watching the pitchmen in Manchester, England, where he grew up, but he wasn't a street urchin by any means. It turns out that Ades lived in a posh apartment on the Upper East Side, where he kept his inventory of peelers in the former maid's room.Vanity Fair wrote a profile of him in 2006, which you can read here. Coincidentally enough, I just bought a peeler from him a few weeks ago. This weekend, I made apple cake, and the peeler worked incredibly well on the apples, scraping off the peel like it was going through butter. It really is the best peeler of all time! I don't know where you can find them now. (Anyone know?) And I certainly don't know where you can find such a genial, old-school and entertaining sales pitch anymore.[Via NYT]

Strange Snacks of the World -- Mochi Croquettes
AUTHOR:
Robert Sietsema

POST:
   The sublime mochi croquette at EN (click to enlarge)  While rarely seen in restaurants, the croquette is central to homestyle Japanese cooking, as seen at the East Village restaurant Chiyono. The croquette probably originated in the Netherlands, but as made by moms all across Japan, features tidbits of meat or fish embedded in potato or other starch, then sculpted into balls or oblongs and deep fried. They are often served with a brown dipping sauce that's somewhere between Worcestershire and ketchup. While few restaurants dare to diddle with croquettes in their simple perfection, a few have intrepidly done so, risking the disapprobation of croquette-loving comfort food aficionados everywhere. Luckily, the new wave croquette pictured above is superb: a conventional duck-dotted potato filling covered with rubbery cubes of?rice starch (called "mochi," that's the kind of starch?used to coat orbs of ice cream in a popular dessert), and then deep fried, making one of the strangest-looking but most scrumptious snacks. While you might expect to?find it in the commissary of the star ship Enterprise, you can get?one much closer, at EN Japanese Brasserie, 435 Hudson Street, 212-647-9196????

Strange Snacks of the World -- Confetti Creme Ritz Bits
AUTHOR:
Robert Sietsema
DATE:
2009-02-2 14:51:00
POST:
 This principle has never been better demonstrated than by Ritz crackers. Invented by Nabisco in 1928 as a sort of luxury cracker, the original Ritz is round, salty, oily, and burnished a deep shade of orangey-brown. While most crackers are intended to be eaten as canapes with some topping, Ritz were said to be able to stand on their own, and, in a marketing gimmick, were actually served at the Waldorf-Astoria. The cracker was considered left well enough alone for many decades, but starting in the 1970s, the number of Ritz brands began to multiply. In addition to Original, there was Low Sodium, Whole Wheat, Roasted Vegetable, and Honey Butter. Meanwhile, a miniature version called Ritz Bits was developed, first as a simple cracker, and later as cookie-type sandwiches, including Cheese, Peanut?Butter, S'mores, Peanut Butter & Jelly, and Pizza. And as if that weren't enough, regular?Ritz were reconfigured as snack chips called Ritz Toasted Chips, and as a?baton-shaped, pretzel-like extrusion called Ritz Sticks. For a short time, there?were a couple of?sandwich Ritz Bits novelties: Peanut Butter and Fudge (two filling layers) and Extreme Cheese (cheese-flavored crackers with a cheese filling). As a student of Ritz, I was excited repulsed to see in my Western Beef a further Ritz Bits flavor: Confetti Creme, with an accent grave over the first "e" in "Creme" (to make the cracker seem French?). Between each pair of miniature, anemic, undersalted crackers, there was a vanilla frosting with tiny parti-colored sugar dots. Had the cracker retained some of its salt, it might have been interesting, but the filling was way too sweet, and the snack correspondingly disgusting.?Maybe the real message of this misbegotten snack is that it occupies an undefined territory between savory snack and cookie, allowing, say, kids to eat it as part of their main meal. But in creating this monster, Nabisco has destroyed?the essence of Ritz: It can't be construed as an actual?cracker anymore.

No, the picture on the banner is clearly a bulbous, fake-skinned ballpark-type frank, the kind?that is?eaten in?the rest of the country. Moreover, the frank is smeared with mustard and ketchup. No sauerkraut. No sauteed onions. It's as if the artist had never seen a New York frank. I won't even go into the artistic qualities of the banner. Actually--yes, I will.?This thing is an eyesore, with jarring colors and annoying graphics. And was a ballpark frank the most iconic?New York food image they could come up with?? And to any real?foodie, visitor or denizen, the banner screams -- Don't eat here!  The banner in context, screaming "Don't dare eat here, the food sucks!"

POST:
Spotted at the airport in Johannesburg: Biltong! Similar to jerky, this South African dried meat snack comes in beef, ostrich, kudu (venison) and other big game flavors. Early Dutch settlers spiced and dried their meat to take on long hunting trips. Today, biltong refers to either dried sliced meat or dried sausage, and makes for a great bar snack to nibble on with a glass of smoky South African shiraz. We also tasted it in a creamy savory soup made with crumbled blue cheese.

What to 'B' to Cube 63
AUTHOR:
Chantal Martineau
DATE:

POST:
Every week or so in 'What to B When You BYOB' we ask a local wine store to recommend a wine under $20 to pair with the food at a nearby BYOB restaurant. This week, we ask Gabrio Tosti di Valminuta of De-Vino wine boutique (30 Clinton Street) to recommend a few bottles to pair with some of the dishes on the menu at Cube 63 (63 Clinton Street). We love sushi with champagne and thought that prosecco would be a no-brainer, but Gabrio surprised us with an aromatic white and two reds. Sirch Ribolla Gialla 2007, Friuli Venezia Giulia ($18) "It's aged in stainless steel tanks so it has good acidity with a bit of funk, peach, spice and earth. But it has no wood so it's crisp and simple." Garbio suggests pairing it with some of the lighter sashimi. Domenico Armani IO Pinot Nero 2006, Trentino Alto Adige ($15) "[Cube 63] has quite a few eclectic rolls with a lot of spice and red goes well with that. This is a very light pinot noir, made in all stainless steel so it has good fruit but is well balanced." Rainoldi Nebbiolo Terrazze di Retiche di Sondrio 2006, Lombardia ($16) "[This region is] in the Alps so the vineyards are at a high altitude, which makes a bright wine, that is complex with a lot of mineral." Gabrio says it may not stand up to an oilier fish like mackerel - you can go for an even bigger red there, such as a syrah - but is perfect for a white fish. Italian wine with Japanese food... who'd've thunk it?

Strange Snacks of the World -- Avocado Fries

POST:
 When I first spotted them on the menu at Williamsburg's El Almacen, I assumed they would be french fries heaped with guacamole, which is one of the random Mexican dishes on the Argentine tapas bar's menu. When they arrived, I gasped. They turned out to be crescents of avocado rolled in panko crumbs and deep fried, leaving them green and creamy on the inside, and crunchy on the outside. Tendered with a dark homemade catsup, avocado fries are not a bad idea, and plenty of fun for just $4. 557 Driggs Avenue, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, 718-218-7284

They have them on the menu at Toloache in midtown as well, as well as Cactus(!) Fries. But get 'em for lunch - they inexplicably cost two dollars more if you order them at dinner.

The burst of the wine bubble is obvious at this year's tastings of the 2008 Bordeaux vintages, where the prices for wine futures have dwindled. With no possibility of a winemaker bailout, the industry must adapt. [NY Times] Utah has repealed two drinking laws that were unique to the state. Bartenders can now serve cocktails directly over the bar rather having to walk around it, and customers no longer have to fill out an application and pay a fee to enter a bar as of July 1. [Dowd on Drinks] A number of bars and restaurants have reported an increase in liquor sales, even as overall business has gone down. To capitalize on the trend, many have extended happy hours and introduced drink specials as even greater incentive to hit the bar. [Crain's] Yet another iPhone drinks app is making the rounds. Cocktails Made Easy allows you to enter each ingredient currently found in your home bar, then comes up with the drinks you could make with the spirits you have on hand. Neat, huh? [Pegu Blog]

 In other recall news, the Lian How brand of spices has asked restaurants to return their pepper products after 42 people in four states became sick from salmonella poisoning. Other potentially affected products include the brand's paprika, onion powder and other ground spices. [SF Chronicle] A German study has found that introducing water fountains in schools, as well as distributing water bottles to students and teaching them about the health benefits of H20 may reduce children's risk of becoming overweight. [NY Times] Fish oil, however, is surprisingly not as beneficial as previously thought. A Florida study found that omega-3 fatty acids-rich fish oils did not help heart attack patients prevent another cardiac episode. [Bloomberg] Pork Magazine has responded to the National Cancer Institute's study that found meat officially unhealthy. The data was allegedly collected from questionnaires asking people to remember what they ate over the previous 12 months, says Pork, which is unreliable. [Pork Magazine]

When I read the whole article in another news blog it stated "the balance of data would still support omega-3 fatty acid supplementation, along with other guideline-recommended therapies and lifestyle modification, for patients with and at risk for cardiovascular disease.” So omega 3 is still recommended. I would bet my last dollar that the people paying for this study were backed by some big pharma group or another - so actually the study's outcome was probably set before it began? Fish Oil can really help increase your omega 3 levels. Learn the best type of fish oil. Find out what is the best way to increase your omega 3.

Tracing Time

POST:
Sustainable? That's so last week. The buzz word in food these days is traceability. Apparently, only five out of 40 foods is traceable, which means that seven of every eight things you put in your mouth could potentially be from a completely unknown source. A number of people and their companies are looking to fight this trend by launching initiatives to improve the traceability of certain foods. The New York Times reported on a flour maker's effort to allow customers to meet the very farmer who produced the wheat in their flour bag. And Tasting Table recently featured a coffee importer with a similar concept. If you've every wanted to email the guy who picks your morning beans, your movement may have arrived.

We amused ourselves (and saved a few bucks) this past weekend making our own classic cocktails. This sultry little number is a Bijou, which is the ancestor of one of our favorite tipples: the Tailspin. We used the King of Cocktails himself, Dale DeGroff's, recipe. 1.5 oz Plymouth gin 0.5 oz green Chartreuse 0.5 oz Italian sweet vermouth (we used Carpano Antica) dash orange bitters lemon peel, for garnish In a shaker, combine the gin, Chartreuse, vermouth and bitters over ice and shake well. Strain into a chilled martini glass. Garnish with the lemon peel (DeGroff calls for either a lemon, cherry or even olive garnish). Drink. Repeat.

Grocery Auctions & Dinner Deals
AUTHOR:

POST:
More people are cooking at home instead of eating out, but they aren't exactly thrilled about it, according to a recent study. More of us doubted the safety of supermarket food last year compared to how we felt about it four years previous, back in the blissfully innocent days before poisonous peanuts. [Reuters] In other supermarket news, bargain hunters have taken to bidding on their groceries at auction. Grocery auctions are great places to pick up everything from cereal to spare ribs to foods that have passed the sell-by date, depending on how hungry you are for savings. [Baltimore Sun] Inspired by Michael Pollan's "The Omnivore's Dilemma," Stone-Buhr flour has launched FindtheFarmer.com, a website that allows customers to learn about and even get in touch with the very farmer who produced the wheat that went into their bag. [NY Times] Upscale restaurants nationwide are offering meal deals to fight a decrease in business due to the recession. Hearth, for example, has $5 soups paired with $5 glasses of sherry and a $35 three-course prix fixe, specials that GM Paul Grieco wouldn't have offered just a year ago. [CNN] Fancy restos aren't the only ones competing for business in a tough economy. Fast-food chains have gone head to head on the most important meal of the day: breakfast. [ABC] Morrissey has stayed true to his "Meat Is Murder" philosophy, requesting that no meat products be sold at Webster Hall before, during, or after his performance last week. Even the cleaning staff brought veggie lunches to work that day. [NY Post]

Flash in the Pan: Clam and Andouille Pot
AUTHOR:
Sarah DiGregorio
DATE:
2009-03-30 10:23:00
POST:
 This pot of steamed clams is incredibly quick, simple and cheap. Use whatever clams you like--fat cherrystones are delicious, but the smaller littlenecks are pictured above. Same goes for the sausage, although I like the way spicy andouille perks up the clam broth. In the summer, use linguica (the spicy Portuguese sausage popular in New England), and also put in quartered corn on the cob and parboiled red potatoes, and you've got an ersatz New England clam bake. But this simpler version is delicious, and requires no chopping other than smashing the garlic cloves. Buy some good bread to sop up the copious broth. Since clams give off a very salty liquor, don't salt the dish until the very end, after you've tasted the broth to see if it's necessary. Clam and Andouille Pot Yield: 2 servings If you're using littleneck clams, serve 20-25 each. Cherry stones are larger, and you could get away with 15-20 each. Since clams are cheap and healthy, I always err towards a larger serving size. 1 tablespoon olive oil 4 cloves garlic, smashed 40 clams, scrubbed 2 andouille sausages, sliced zest of 1 lemon 1 tablespoon chile flakes 1 cup dry white wine salt and pepper, if necessary bread, for serving Preheat oven to 350 degrees. In a large saucepan over medium heat, warm the olive oil. Add the garlic, and saute until fragrant. Add the remaining ingredients, place the lid on the pot, and place pot in the oven. Cook for 30 minutes, or until most clams have opened. Discard clams that have not opened, and taste broth for seasoning. If it needs salt, add a pinch, as well as a generous pinch of black pepper. Serve with bread for sopping up the broth.

Pix from the Bacon Debacle

POST:
When five o'clock struck, the line was already around the block for the Bacon Takedown at Radegast (click to savor). Over the last year or so, the defining event in the Brooklyn culinary scene has become the recipe cook-off, whether it involves baby pig, mac-and-cheese, chili, or chowder. Yesterday, it was a Bacon Takedown at Radegast Beer Hall, a large Czech beer garden in Williamsburg, and one of?my favorite places to grab a foamy stein. In the provocative poster,?a babe with a leather brassiere rides a well-fortified pig. The problem is, these events are cheap and nutritious and have become so wildly popular that you can't depend on getting in anymore. And the $10 ticket price made this a must-attend event. The odor of bacon perfumed the air as I arrived at 5:00 to find a line stretching down Berry and around the corner on N. 4th Street. As soon as I got in line, a runner came down the line singing out that the event was sold out and there was no bacon to be had. Instead of rioting, the docile crowd dispersed, and I waited for 10 minutes in a much shorter line that sought only to get inside the space and drink. In a bacon jail! Once inside, the double warehouse proved to be packed, and it was nearly impossible to even get a beer from the bar. The line of people that had paid to get in circled around both rooms and then doubled back on itself. "Those folks at the end are going to have to wait more than an hour even for their first taste," a friend observed. The line of cooks dishing up their bacon-containing recipes, including bacon brownies, and cylindrical cookies with a bacon-bearing filling. The place was mad with foodies, and by positioning myself at the end of the serving line, I was able to cop samples as friends and acquiantances came off the line with plates full of food. In this way I tried bacon-ramified yellow sheet cake, bacon and avocado sorbet, and bacon cookies. As far as I could tell, there were no dishes that featured entire strips of bacon, or even traditiional recipes (e.g. -- German potato salad, frisee aux lardons) that showcased bacon. In other words, while you could make a caloric meal of the two dozen or so items, it was hard to feel as if you'd had enough bacon. Because the event was a competition, the entrants strove for creativity ala Top Chef, rather than highlighting bacon goodness. Still, on a gloomy Sunday, it was the place to be in Williamsburg. Nothing left but the crumbs of the bacon cake.

Hi Robert - As a contestant, I have to say that although it would be great to be able to let more people in, it was really hard to make enough food for 300! I made the bacon turtles and it was a huge project!! Check out my round up on my blog (link above.) I also made the Smoked Salmon Chowder at the Chowder Slam - I heard you liked it! The recipe is up, too. Thanks!!

We stand behind the meat we cook with and the people who raise it. We do not support factory farming or the mistreatment of animals raised for meat. And we are deeply offended that these people think they can threaten us like this, without even considering how we run our business, how much money and time and care we've put into trying to serve delicious, responsibly-sourced food prepared by well-informed, respectful cooks. We know there are better fights for them to fight out there.

From "Healthy reasons to forgo foie gras" ~ Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences—the most prestigious scientific body in the United States—a team of scientists produced evidence that tiny fibers of proteins found in foie gras may trigger a potentially deadly disease in humans called amyloidosis. Amyloidosis, which primarily affects people with inflammatory conditions like rheumatoid arthritis, is caused by a reaction similar to mad cow. But, instead of a buildup of prion proteins, there’s a buildup of amyloid proteins throughout the body. Amyloid deposits in the human liver, spleen and kidney can lead to extensive organ damage and even death.

Butter triggers heart disease, an even deadly disease than amyloidosis. Butter is in everyone. Foie Gras in an occasional treat when dining out at expensive restaurants.

Incredibly Annoying Food Songs

POST:
Our staff at Fork in the Road has been busy the last few weeks evaluating youtubes, seeking to find not the best and most uplifiting, but the very most annoying songs about food. Songs that make you grit your teeth, then make you laugh, turn your computer off, and take a walk outside in the sunshine. ? This youtube about toast is annoying for so many reasons, we won't bother to list them all, but note how your tiny computer speaker crackles and nearly breaks each time the guy yells into the mike, and the ultra-annoying laugh track, which sounds like a sadistic dentist has pumped nitrous oxide into the waiting room. Gummy Bear Video This gummy bear video is so annoying, Youtube.com has disabled our ability to embed it. See if you don't nearly vomit when the little critter shows us his butt crack, and then starts shaking it, or when we see him beaming from the crown of the Statue of Liberty. Is nothing sacred? In fact, the Gummy Bear Song has spawned a series of parodies, just as annoying in their own way as the original. At least this one features a gummy bear gnawing his leg off. Fork in the Road disclaimer: Gummy bears are not vegetarian! They contain meat renderings that may contain prions, which cause mad cow disease. If the gummy bear videos cause you to run out and eat some gummy bears, we refuse to be held responsible for the consequences.

Only five out of 40 foods can be traced all the way through the supply chain, according to investigators from the Health and Human Services office. The faulty system could undermine our ability to solve a disease outbreak or bioterrorism attack. [AP via Google] The Agriculture Department will dole out 200 million lbs of nonfat dry milk surpluses to domestic feeding programs to benefit low-income families and dairy farmers. The surplus will be used for processing or to barter for high-temperature milk, cheese and soups. [Reuters] The CEO of the Food Bank of Western New York died March 24. Thomas Heine, a native of Buffalo, had been in the food industry for 40 years. [Biz Journals] Ethiopia has shut down six of its largest coffee bean exporters, suspending their licenses after Prime Minister Meles Zenawi accused them of illegally stockpiling beans until international prices rise. [Bloomberg] Times are tough, and the U.S. beef industry is responding by promoting new, cheaper and previously unpopular cuts of beef, as well as pushing meat sales harder overseas.

Now that the Obamas have started planting their garden, eating locally is sure to become more popular. You too can be an upstanding locavorous member of society at the simple touch of an LCD screen. The new iPhone Locavore app provides all the tools necessary to eat locally, from maps to the nearest farmer's market to information on seasonal produce. iPhone can already help you find your favorite cocktail recipe, should you ever find yourself trapped behind a bar, surrounded by booze with no idea what to do with it. Other new apps designed for hip foodies on the go include the iPhone Calorie Counter and ReadyPing, which allows restaurants to text you when your table is ready. Not to be entirely outdone, BlackBerry has just launched GoodFoodNearYou, a free service that allows you to search for nutrition information on restaurant dishes.

Worst Magazine in America?
AUTHOR:
Robert Sietsema
DATE:

POST:
My heart leapt when a friend sent a link with the title "20 Worst Foods in America 2009." A dozen possibilities raced pell-mell through my fevered brain - Did they mean worst-tasting foods? Worst foods for the environment? Most expensive foods? Most boring foods? But when I got to the website, it turned out to be a magazine with the worst (in this case, most yawn-provoking) title I can imagine: Men's Health. I think I'd rather read a magazine called Zebra's Health, or Orangutan's Health. Anyway - you guessed it! - their idea of Worst Foods in America is based solely on number of calories and amount of fat. This kind of reductivist thinking is what leads to fatness in the first place. ("Ahhhh, if I go for the hamburger without the bun at Appleby's, then I can go ahead and drink that two-liter bottle of Coke sitting in front of me.") But it's the underlying assumptions of the piece that really make the name "Men's Health" a colossal joke. You've seen this tired formula for an article a dozen times before - rummage through the nutritional information for franchise fast food spots and then laugh at the astronomical calorie counts and fat contents. But never question eating in fast food joints because that might discourage advertisers. The real advice they should be giving you is: Stay away from places that serve over-processed food (with lots of corn syrup, "cheese food product," and additives) entirely, or eat in them rarely. Get some fresh veggies, throw in a little meat, chicken, tofu, or fish if you want, and cook the stuff at home. Other assumptions underlying the article are also entirely whack from a nutrition standpoint. For example, for each franchise restaurant, they "out" the bad entrée, but then recommend another entrée that's supposed to be virtuous. Thus, one is advised at California's In-N-Out Burger to pick the burger wrapped in lettuce without the bun, because it will save a few calories. Dudes, it's not really a burger if you have to eat it without the bun. Why not just eat the freezer-burned, rancid-tasting patty by itself? (I'm talking about places like McDonald's here -- the ground beef at In-N-Out is actually fresh tasting and excellent.) Men's Health still believes in the Atkins diet, which has been thoroughly discredited by nutritionists. Carbs are essential to life and happiness. If you want to get healthy, stay out of restaurants with long-frozen, shipped-from-across-the-globe, over-processed foods tendered in humongous servings. Eat less, and keep your nose out of Men's Health.

POST:
It's been three episodes and now we're definitely able to say with complete certainty that we don't care. Eat me daily reported that the show is getting hammered in the ratings, and after last night's Central Park episode - was the Black team's pigeon from the park, too? - we're going to have a hard time continuing to tune in. The main problem, we've decided, are those dreadful end-of-episode meetings around the table, where emotions are vented, accusations made, and tears shed. We like a chef-testant break down as much as the next guy, but these meetings feel contrived and about as riveting as any end-of-shift staff meeting. Maybe if the food shots were a little more porny, we could find ourselves slightly more excited by CB, but there's something about raw fowl (see episodes 1 and 3) that is a major turnoff. And, while the food critics on the show are a great source of entertainment, they aren't enough to keep our attention or, apparently, that of most viewers.

This week in chef news... Daniel Ochoa Pascual of Llanten, a restaurant in Valladolid, Spain, has been invited to cook at Le Cirque on April 7. Wine director Paul Altuna will pair Spanish wines with Pascual's dishes for the occasion. The second annual Top Chef Tour starts Friday at the Flatiron Pedestrian Plaza. The 21-city tour will have the chef'testants stopping in New Orleans, D.C., Boston and L.A. Alain Ducasse is the proud papa of a new baby boy, Arzhel. The French chef has also been immortalized in wax at Paris' Musée Grévin along with his signature dish, cocotte des légumes. [NY Post] Michael Psilakis, of Anthos fame, cooked at the White House yesterday, calling the experience, "a carpet ride that has just been magical... surreal." [NY Times]

Food safety advocacy groups are urging President Obama to appoint a senior food safety official within the FDA, and are pushing for a new agency devoted solely to food safety to eventually be created. [Reuters] A study conducted by Columbia and the University of California has shown that high school students whose schools are within a block of a fast food joint are more likely to be obese than those who study even a quarter of a mile further away. [NY Times] Beware your sweet tooth. Researchers at Johns Hopkins have found a link between the consumption of fructose and increased food intake, which may also lead to a higher risk of obesity and Type 2 diabetes. [Science Daily] The backlash against bottled water continues. A Canadian University will gradually ban the sale of the stuff following a student vote to do so. The decision is part of a wider campaign to implement greener practices at the university. [CBC]

This week, Counter Culture barges into Rockmeisha, a West Village itzakaya, or Japanese pub. The occasion of this invasion was a piece in rameniac.com (Hailey Eber also blogged about it) that claimed the place offered the fourth best ramen noodles in NYC. Indeed, the chashu ramen are delicious, though less fussy than the comparable product at Ippudo:    Grilled sardines that may or may not demonstrate a Portuguese influence in that part of the world:    A luscious yellowfin (negima-ae) appetizer in a pool of shoyu dressing:    But one thing we didn't dig was a serving of pure cream cheese ("cheese yakko"), plated as if it were tofu:

Bloody and marbled is how you want your steak. So, why not your steak shorts? The Weird Clothing Company sells these Bermudas in authentic looking supermarket meat section packaging.

This week in the Voice, Robert Sietsema and Sarah DiGregorio bring you Izakaya Week. They check out Rockmeisha in the West Village and Qoo Robata Bar in Williamsburg, respectively, for satisfying Japanese pub grub. Bruni gives the new Bouley the same number of stars he gave the old Bouley - three - even though the food still isn't on par with Per Se's and the reservationist is testy. [NY Times] Meanwhile, TONY awards four out of a potential six stars to the revamped Bouley, citing pleasant appetizers and bold entrées, despite hour-long waits between courses. [TONY] Restaurant Girl drops in on Chez Lucienne, an "affordable" French bistro in Harlem, giving in two stars for its simple steaks and foie gras terrine. [NY Daily News] NY Mag says that the Manhattan outpost of Red Hook hero shop Defonte's serves up sandwiches that are just as "titanic" as the ones in Brooklyn, giving it two stars. [NY Magazine]

Making Msemmen

POST:
You know that moment when you're about to throw away an ancient food magazine and, just before dropping it into the recycling bin, you give it one last look? Well, we had such a moment this week when we salvaged this too-easy-to-pass-up recipe from an old Gourmet (February 2008) for msemmen or spiced Algerian flat bread. 3 cups flour (the recipe called for whole wheat but all we had lying around was all-purpose... we know, how colon-cloggingly uncouth of us!) 1 tsp salt 1/2 cup olive oil 1 tsp cumin (again, the recipe called for ground, but being the lazy cooks that we are, we used whole seed, which we thought actually made the end result prettier) 1 tsp paprika 1 tsp turmeric Combine flour, salt, and one quarter of the oil in a large bowl. Slowly stir in about 1 1/2 cups water until dough is no longer sticky. On a lightly floured surface, knead for about 15 minutes, then form dough into a ball and coat with one quarter of the oil. Cover and let stand at room temperature for 1 hour. With the remaining half of oil, stir in cumin, paprika, turmeric.  Divide dough into equal pieces, rolling them into balls (larger than golf ball but smaller than a baseball). Flatten each piece into a disk, and, on a lightly floured surface with a rolling pin, roll out each one until thin. Using your fingers, drizzle a small amount of the spiced oil onto each disk, then roll it up tightly and coil into a tight spiral. Transfer each coil to a large sheet of wax paper and keep covered as you go. Tape down a new sheet of wax paper and roll out each spiral of dough into a new disk on it. In a large dry cast-iron skillet or griddle over medium heat, cook each disk, turning once, until puffed and blackened in spots. Serve right away (we did with a sweet apple cranberry chutney we happened to have in the fridge) or reheat the next day in the oven on low heat until lightly toasted. (We did this too, and served with leftover roasted chicken and rice.)

A Gordon Ramsay restaurant in London is under investigation by local food safety authorities after a patron pulled an inch-and-a-half-long piece of plastic out from a bite of lamb. The rub? The customer was a reality TV star from British Wife Swap. [Telegraph] Would a ban on non-therapeutic antibiotic use in animals hurt the health of livestock? With some 70 percent of all antibiotics sold in the U.S. going toward livestock, it would certainly hurt drug companies. [Reuters] Should our future involve a Jetsons-esque existence of dehydrated foodstuffs made for consuming in zero-gravity environments light years from Earth, the L'Equip FilterPro Food Dehydrator will be right there with us. [CNET] Now you can fight ulcers, chronic gastritis and even stomach cancer with a "functional" yogurt fortified with urease antibodies, according to a recent human clinical study.

We've hardly ever met a brat we didn't like and this veal wurst was no different. Straight from the grill and served with a caramelized onion sauce and a side of rösti (crispy potato hash cake), it's the first main course on the dinner menu at Café Select, a cozy Swiss joint on Lafayette owned by Serge Becker from La Esquina across the street. Perfectly snappy yet buttery soft inside, the veal brat is best enjoyed with a glass from Select's all-Alpine wine list. We opted for the house pinot noir, a light-bodied ruby red juice with plenty of clay and mineral. The Feedbag recently wrote about the not-so-secret Back Room at Café Select, but we preferred the hidden alcove just off the main dining room that only fits about four people - maybe six, if there's snuggling involved.

Can't wait till the next Restaurant Week in New York? You don't have to. Other resto weeks are happening around the city and beyond. Dine In Brooklyn kicked off yesterday and runs through April 2nd. Smithtown, Long Island gets its first restaurant week this week, and Bay Shore has one, too. That's a heckuva lot of discounted three-course meals.

Theories vary on exactly why. For many, sugar lifts spirits dragged low by the languishing economy. For others, candy also provides a nostalgic reminder of better times. And not insignificantly, it is relatively cheap.

This week in booze news... Justin Timberlake tossed his designer fedora into the ring of celebrities with their own spirits brands with his newly launched 901 tequila. The number is supposed to signify the beginning of party time but also happens to be the area code for Memphis, JT's hometown. [YumSugar] Time Out takes a look at cask ales, crafted beers that contain live yeasts for extra bubbles and complexity, and visits 40 bars around town that serve such zesty pints. [TONY] The Flip 'N Drink is the latest iPhone cocktail app making the rounds. It has a huge database of drink recipes and, although you'll find an Appletini in there, that particular breed of cocktail is kept to a minimum. [The Pegu Blog] Some liquor stores support the proposal to allow supermarkets to sell wine, which would result in increased competition. The catch? They want to be able to add cheese and other snacks to their inventory. Wine for cheese seems like a fair trade. [NY Times] Tomorrow night, don't miss one of our favorite wine importers, Jenny & Francois at one of our favorite wine bars, Ten Bells on the LES, where they'll be introducing patrons to natural winemaker Denis Deschamps from Estezargues.

The Early Word -- Beer Table Tuesdays
AUTHOR:
Robert Sietsema

POST:
 The luscious smoked chop at Beer Table (click to reheat) Much has been made of the special theme nights, guest chefs, and even micro-restaurants that have been implanted in regular restaurants lately. For restaurant patrons, this is a good thing, and one wonders why no one thought of it previously. So it was with great interest that we dropped in at Beer Table in the southern reaches of Park Slope to check out the table d'hote menu currently being mounted by Julie Farias, a chef who previously worked at Cafe Boulud, Five Ninth, and Ici, among other places. She invents one three course meal each Tuesday evening for $25, which?turns out to be quite a bargain. The first course -- Cambodian/Tex-Mex meat dip con crudite The small barrom is composed of?parallel?raised tables flanked by barstools. Scuttling into our seats after a 45 minute wait, we felt like sardines. Still, it allowed us to evesdrop on some fascinating conversations. For an additional $15, you can have a beer pairing with the menu, but I leave it for you to decide if it's a good deal or not. Frankly, I'd have preferred one beer throughout. The first course was a dip that, in its meaty texture, reminded me of certain dips formulated in Cambodia, though the flavor had a lot of Tex-Mex mixed in (Julie hails from San Antonio, Texas). The dip came with a nice collection of vegetables for dipping, though the dip tends to slide off the vegetables, and you'll find yourself spooning up the remainder. The second course was a smoked pork chop accompanied by a slurry of eggplant, which made a nice non-starchy accompaniment. The eggplant was rendered unboring by a faint spiciness. The chop was a paragon of smoky succulence. There was a bit of a lag before the dessert of perfectly fried bananas arrived with a peanut dipping sauce. The regular snack menu -- things like radishes with butter and sea salt, and blue cheese with honey and dried cherry compote -- is available throughout. When we poked our head in the kitchen, the?chef?mentioned that she might soon be doing enchilada Wednesdays, as well. We can't wait.

First came bottled water, then designer water, then flavored and electrolyte-enhanced designer water. Then came the backlash: bottled water is not only harmful to the environment for its unnecessary packaging but also for the cost of transporting it to the consumer. But how can we go back to plain, boring tap after becoming accustomed to cracking open a bottle of our favorite artisanal H2O? The new book, Cool Waters by New York food stylist Brian Preston-Campbell, celebrates what can be done with plain, boring tap water -- from mineral-packed post-workout drinks to sophisticated pairing ideas. How refreshing. Excerpted from Cool Waters, The Green Herb Infusion: juice of 1/2 lime 4 cups still water 1 tbsp fresh parsley leaves 4-6 fresh peppermint leaves 2 fresh basil leaves 5 mustard seeds Add the lime juice and 3 cups of water to a large pitcher. Place the parsley, peppermint, basil, and mustard seeds in a blender with the remaining 1 cup water. Purée until smooth, for about 1 minute. Strain the puréed mixture through a fine-mesh sieve into the pitcher. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour before serving.

Our man Robert Sietsema was in the East Village this past weekend filling up on chowder at Jimmy #43's "Chowder Slam," an event to benefit the New Amsterdam Market. The organization, which is working toward establishing an indoor public market in Manhattan made up of butchers, grocers and mongers of all sorts, is seeking volunteers who are good with their hands to help build stalls and kiosks for the new market. Not as fun as eating chowder, we know, but a great way to support small farms and other food purveyors.

Alice Waters' 60 Minutes appearance left us hungry for more fooderati coverage, which we got in the form of dessert virtuoso Johnny Iuzzini being featured on Nightline's Platelist segment Friday night. The pastry hunk says the journey to sweets success began in his childhood when he would come home from school and "pound at least two quarts of milk a day" with his Chips Ahoys. Other highlights include his dehydrated purple foam, his warning to fresh chef school grads that it ain't all peaches n' cream in the real culinary world, and his confession that his job has forced him to sacrifice many of his relationships. Don't you just wanna give him a big chocolate-covered hug?

Now that everyone and his mother has a food blog, it comes as little surprise that the talk of the SXSW Interactive Festival this year was food. SXSWi hosted its first ever panel on the secrets of successful food blogging, featuring speakers from Cupcakes Take the Cake and Midtown Lunch. [Gourmet] Real sugar is back in favor as food companies have started shunning increasingly unpopular high-fructose corn syrup, even though many scientists still say the two are equally harmful in excess. [NY Times] A national survey of some 3,000 adults found that more Americans are getting their caffeine fixes at home. The poll also showed a decline in gourmet coffee and fancy espresso drinks. [Reuters] A number of drug companies may support the proposal to split the FDA, which would allow them to speed up new drug approvals without being distracted by food-safety snafus, such as the recent mass recall due to salmonella found in peanut products. [AP via Google] Mark Bittman reminds readers that "the word [organic] is not synonymous with 'safe,' 'healthy, 'fair' or even necessarily 'good,'" urging them to opt for real, local foods rather than processed items or fruits from other hemispheres.

Dispatch from the Chowder Battlefield
AUTHOR:

POST:
Zoe Feigenbaum (#7, clam, oyster, pork belly chowder) dressed in a shark costume to lure (scare away?) voters. (Actually, it looks like a Hazmat suit. Click to decomtaminate.) Jimmy's #43, the local temple of locavorism, hosted a "chowder slam" Saturday afternoon to benefit the New Amsterdam Market. For $20, you could wend your way through the?mazelike underground restaurant to eat your fill -- in tiny gulps -- of 14 different chowders. I wouldn't describe any of them as traditional, and many of the chowder cooks were clearly straining for the Zeitgeist, of which local and sustainable are the twin mantras. (Hey, count me in!) Nick Suarez's chowder (#6) boasted bacon and duck fat. There were chowders with pork belly, chowders incorporating duck fat, and others with Hatch chile powder, chicken, scallops, and?salmon ("My mother sent it from Juneau," the cook excitedly proclaimed of the latter). For the lactose intolerant,?Erynn Sosinski's?#9, "Call Me Fishmael," showed a fine literary sensibility while incorporating zero dairy.?Ted Smith's (#11) chowder had so many ingredients that I couldn't get to the end of the list. "It's kinda like a San Francisco cippolino," he noted, stirring a vat of the ultra-chunky potage. There was even a vegetarian chowder, courtesy of Shana Wright (#2, "Dr. Strangeplant"), containing eggplant and "sea vegetables," among other ingredients.  "Thickened Old School, with bread crumbs," according to Erynn Sosinski (#9) Ladled into small, recyclable paper cups, the servings of chowder were rarely unaccompanied. One came with a bacon gougere as a distracion, while another came with a big puffy homemade roll. One cook dropped a crab fritter into the soup, while another deposited flakes of sundried cheese. Chopped scallions was the most common -- and most conventional -- addition. As the Jimmy's became mobbed around 2 pm (the event lasted from noon till 5 pm), I slipped out, unwilling to wait till 5 pm?to find out who won. (See comments, below,?for the winners.) The chowders achieved a fairly high level of culinary wizardry, some chunky, some thin, but, as in episodes of Top Chef, novel ingredients and techniques were featured, even though a perfect bowl of plain old?New England or Manhattan chowder proabably would have?won. Chowder hysteria grips the room. Jimmy himself is to be spotted in the left foreground.

 All hail the lonely cotton-candy vendor, his wares umbrella'ed above him in pastel, particolored splendor. A harbinger of spring, he waits for the first children to arrive in the park across the street in Richmond Hill, Queens (click to enlarge).  At 113th Street and Park Avenue in Manhattan, where the Metro North railway takes wing and becomes elevated, a pair of hand-painted signs for a meat-oriented supremarket that seems to no longer exist (though one of the same name still does business on N. 6th in Williamsburg). Did the painter use 1940s hand-colored postcards for a model. Why are the farm animals so large? Any why are the pigs stacked that way?

Shacking Up For Spring

POST:
Persians celebrate the birth of spring with a table of fruits and grains. We like to do it with a visit to the Shake Shack. The new uptown location is not actually in Central Park so we got our burger, shake and crinkly fries to go, and footed it past the American Museum of Natural History to find a nice spot in the park, sucking down thick vanilla custard along the way. The compact cheeseburger, easy to palm and negotiate with one hand, was as satisfying as the ones back in Madison Square Park and, although the fries had cooled considerably during the brisk walk, they certainly did the trick. The trio: $12.25, with tax. Time lapsed between order and consumption, including the walk from the Shack to the park: roughly 23 minutes.

POST:
Hamed Saber @ Flickr The 13-day Persian new year's celebration kicked off last night as Iranians the world over prepared for Nouruz, which officially started at 7:44 AM EST today. A traditional Nouruz table is set with seven items that begin with the letter 'S': sabzeh (wheat, barley or lentils to symbolize rebirth), samanu (wheat germ pudding for prosperity), senjed (dried oleaster tree fruit for love), sîr (garlic for health), sîb (apples for beauty), sumac berries (for the color of sunrise), and serkeh (vinegar to symbolize age and patience). The fifth annual Persian Parade will be held in Midtown on March 29. We toasted Nouruz at Tailor last night with Chef Hoss Zaré, who was visiting from San Francisco to cook for the James Beard House Nouruz party held on Wednesday, and his drinks director, Reza Esmaili. Zaré said he was proud of the sekanjabin he'd made for the James Beard party, a minted vinegar syrup enjoyed over ice in his native Iran. Esmaili used the syrup to make Minted Memory cocktails, incorporating gin, Pimm's and lemon. He named the cocktail for the flavors of sekanjabin, which he says are "minted into the memories of Persians."

This week in blogs... Alice Waters' appearance on 60 Minutes was all over the blogosphere this week. Eat me daily had one of the most in-depth analyses of the segment, calling it a "missed opportunity" on Waters' part to show how to eat organic and sustainable on a budget. [Eat me daily] After the second episode of NBC's The Chopping Block, in which Vogue's Jeffrey Steingarten ripped cheftestants a new one, Serious Eats posed the question, "Who Should Be on Reality TV: White, Steingarten, or Ramsay?" [Serious Eats] Brooklyn food blogger Eat. Drink. Memory. called for readers to invest in the restaurant Delicious on the Slope, "a nice neighborhood place run by a lovely man who has invested more than simply money and time in the business." [via via Grub Street] Eater posted a roundup of reactions to the new Fatty Crab UWS, including this quote from Robert Sietsema: "The [Fatty Dog] was dressed like a Chicago red hot with rabies, featuring hot pickled chiles, pickled radish discs, and a French aioli." [Eater] Corby Kummer posted that Starbucks food scientists have found that mixing Parmesan into the egg in their new breakfast sandwich prevents the smell of egg being transferred to the coffee when the two are packaged into takeout bag.

Peñín Guide In Hand
AUTHOR:
Chantal Martineau
DATE:
2009-03-19 16:28:00
POST:
Spanish wine critic José Peñín unveiled his Peñín Guide to Spanish Wine 2009 yesterday at a wine tasting held at the American Museum of Natural History. We had a quick tête-à-tête with the critic over a glass of vino or 30. You've often been compared to Robert Parker for your use of the 100-point system. Is there a concern among wine drinkers your country, as there is in ours, that winemakers are tailoring their wines to your tastes, as many winemakers here do to Parker's tastes? Yes, but it's different. In the United States, the mainstream consumer is so influenced by Parker's ratings that the wine that has been tailored to Parker is, in fact, tailored to the average consumer. In Spain, some winemakers try to touch on my taste but these are very niche winemakers. My education and background are different to Mr. Parker's. He has a French education, he loves Burgundy and Bordeaux. I am influenced by Spanish wine. I have tried every region. What can the points system not convey about a wine? The point system cannot communicate the idea behind the wine, the philosophy of the winemaker. What really worries me is that the mainstream consumer will just focus on the critic's point of view, beyond the style of winemaking, beyond their own criteria. The critic should help the average consumer to choose what he really wants. Like a guide. Should Americans still consider Spanish wine a low-cost option? Spain has many styles of wine and many types of wine. But, no, Spanish wines should no longer be considered to be in the competitive-price category. That's too bad. Still, we managed to find a deal or two among the newcomers at the tasting. The 2007 A Coroa is made from an aromatic white grape called Godello. We'd definitely shell out $20 for a bottle of this floral, romantic wine. At around the same price, the 2005 Petit Grealó, a red blend aged in steel, had a brilliantly pure expression of black fruit. The spicy, mocha-nosed Marqués de Valdueza 2006 was impressive, but a little rich for our blood at $40 a pop. The light body and eucalyptus notes of the 2007 Stratvs Crianza made our heart beat fast, but is a tough sell at $50+. The best deal in Spanish vino? Sherry. The fortified wine has made a major comeback in the last couple of years. A straw-colored off-dry Tio Pepe Manzanilla retails at 18 bucks and is the best-selling brand in the world, but managed to earn a hefty 93-point score from Peñín. Guess some of the critic's tastes are in line with those of common folk, after all. In this case, at least, the people have it right.

The long awaited trailer for Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs has been released on YouTube. The animated adaptation of the popular children's book, written and illustrated by husband-and-wife team Judi and Ron Barrett, is expected to be out in September. We're so excited, we can barely hold on to our cheeseburgers. [via Serious Eats]

Kinda disappointing to see a beautifully illustrated book with a quiet magical feel to it turned into an action packed, 3-D, wowee zowee crazy movie with topical jokes. I can't bring myself to watch the live action Dr. Suess movies, though this one does look better than those.

There were more than a few gems from last night's episode. To wit... Vogue food critic Jeffrey Steingarten to the Black team in reference to the buffalo mozzarella: "Did you run it over with a truck or something?" Steingarten to the Red team: "No one should want farmed salmon... it's the kind of surprise that you get when the doctor says you have herpes." Zan & Than about their hope that the Red team was plagued worse than they were: "Bees. Like, a lot of bees in the restaurant." But what stood out from the episode was the Chilean sea bass debacle. In a valid complaint, guest of honor Nicole Miller exclaimed, "I don't want to serve anybody Chilean sea bass. Like, ever!" It was uncomfortable to watch poor Michael's bewildered expression and Lisa's tight-lipped defiance when Miller put her (surely elegantly shod) foot down because, of course, the fashion designer was right. Does anyone in New York still serve Chilean sea bass? In a city where it's perfectly acceptable to ask where one's veggie side was harvested or what one's entrée was fed before it became food itself, I more than sympathized with Miller's horror at serving the endangered fish. Lisa, who is from Malibu, and Michael, from New Jersey, should really have known better. But isn't part of the aim of these televised cooking competitions for cheftestants to "learn from the experience?" And, should viewers gain a little enlightenment in the process, isn't that just gravy? At the beginning of the episode, Marco Pierre White gives each team a cooking demo in an effort to teach them about using simple, fresh ingredients. Maybe next week's lesson should be on the ethical and environmental implications of using certain foods. Or maybe Nicole Miller already took care of that lesson for him.

 This week in chef news... Top Chef season four's Antonia Lofaso and Iron Chef Kevin Rathbun will be in St. Croix April 14-18 for a fundraising event called "Iron Chef, Top Chef, Island Chef." The two TV chefs, along with a local chef, will compete to make the best 30-minute meal, each with the same local ingredients. Proceeds will go to the St. Croix Foundation, a local community development group. Le Bernardin's Eric Ripert was inducted into the French Legion d'Honneur this week, which is something like being knighted. He joins the rank of fellow Chevalier (knight) Daniel Boulud. [Feedback] Resto's new executive chef, Bobby Hellen, implements a more locavorist philosophy, adding such specialties to the menu as house charcuterie, lamb belly confit and a cote de boeuf, both from Four Story Hill Farm, as well as veggies from the Greenmarket. [Grub Street] L'Atelier de Joël Robuchon executive chef, Yosuke Suga, is leaving the restaurant but not the family. He will take over the Taipei branch next month, while Xavier Boyer, from the London branch, is slated to take his place in New York. [NY Times] Eater reports that Brandon Kida has been named chef de cuisine at Asiate in the Mandarin Oriental, where he has worked since the restaurant's opening in 2003. A commenter says the promotion is long overdue. [Eater]

More than 30 employees of the "21" Club filed a class action suit against their employer on Tuesday, claiming that the restaurant has been illegally withholding their tips. The amount in question could be more than $1 million. [NY Times] Kellogg CEO, David Mackay, calls for an overhaul of the country's food safety system. The company has lost close to $70 million since the beginning of the peanut product recall. Mackay says we need an authority other than the FDA devoted solely to regulating food safety. [Reuters] The LA Times noted that Frank Bruni recently visited the city to review three restaurants for his Outstanding Newcomer series. Bruni awarded the coveted tag to Bazaar, enjoyed Animal, but was underwhelmed by Palate Food + Wine, which has earned raves from local critics. [LA Times] A panel of nutritionists in the UK has found that the recipes of British celebrity chefs, such as Gordon Ramsay and Nigella Lawson, are loaded with (gasp!) harmful fats. In New York, however, chefs are cutting fatty ingredients from their menus. [NY Daily News] GoodGuide, a service that rates the eco-friendliness of household goods, has started rating foodstuffs - and not only for their environmental footprint but also their nutritional value. Its database of food products is expected to grow from 5,000 to tens of thousands within the next few weeks. [CNET]

      A friend riding her bike in Brighton Beach today paused at her usual pit-stop, the Brighton Bazaar, 1007 Brighton Beach Avenue, to pick up smoked fish and other picnic supplies, only to discover the gates pulled down and the place closed up. When she inquired in a nearby Russian bakery, La Brioche, she discovered that the owner of the mega-Russian market, Vlad Tolstykh, had been attacked in a parking lot near the store on Saturday afternoon around 2 pm by a pair wielding a hammer and an axe. He was?taken to Coney Island Hospital, according to the bakery's proprietor,?and expired soon thereafter. The motive for the robbery may have been money. The funeral is set for today. photo courtesy of KPbIMc on flickr? Related Content Related Stories...

Apparently, roux isn't the key to perfect gumbo. Actually, it's all in the water. Tasting Table reports on a New Orleans bookshop that will ship bona fide NOLA tap water to anywhere in the country so that even us Yanks can make authentic Cajun fare. Kitchen Witch, in the French Quarter, specializes in rare and antique cookbooks but also sells ingredients, such as its homemade vanilla extract. You can get NOLA tap water delivered to your doorstep for $20 per gallon, plus shipping. And you thought New York City tap water was the finest.

Remember Top Chef season 3's Brian Malarkey's appearance on The Real Housewives of Orange County? Well, the Housewives are at it again. Only this time, it's the ones from New York City. Sam Talbot of Top Chef 2 fame drops in on housewife Kelly Killoren Bensimon to make chicken lettuce wraps for her, her kids and Countess LuAnn de Lesseps, who picks up on a hint of flirtation between the chef and his hostess. We tend to think the only eyelashes batting were hers, but that might be due to the flame we're still holding for kitchen hottie Talbot. [via Eat me daily]

POST:
Bar Blanc's newish executive chef Sebastiaan Zijp shares the recipe for his Braised Lamb Shoulder Pappardelle with Shiitake Mushrooms, 24-Hour Tomatoes, Black Olives, and Basil. For the braised lamb: 2 lbs of lamb shoulder 1 large carrot, quartered 1 large onion, quartered 1/2 head garlic, split 2 ribs celery, quartered 5 sprigs thyme 1 bay leaves 1 tbsp toasted black pepper 1 orange, sliced thick 1 lemon, sliced thick 0.25 quart white wine 3 quarts lamb stock or chicken stock or veal stock or water, whatever you have Combine all the ingredients and marinate for one day. In a roasting pan, cook the lamb at 190° for about twelve hours. (This might be a little much at home, so you might try cooking it at 300° for 4-5 hours.) Let the lamb cool to room temp in the liquid, then remove. Strain the liquid and, in a saucepan over medium heat, reduce it by half to three quarters, depending on the strength of your stock. Shred the meat off the bones. For the 24-hour tomatoes: 12 plum tomatoes 1 tbsp salt 1 tbs sugar 3 sprigs thyme 1 bay leaf cracked white pepper, to taste With a paring knife, core the tomatoes and cut an x into the bottom. Blanch for thirty seconds to a minute to loosen the skin. Cool in an ice bath, then peel. Halve the tomatoes, scooping out all the seeds. Toss with salt, sugar, thyme, bay leaf and pepper. Marinate overnight. Drain liquid and place tomatoes, face down, on a baking sheet. Cook at 200° for about 4 hours or until they are almost dry. To finish: serves 6-8 30 oz. pappardelle 1 tbsp braised lamb per serving 12 pieces baby shiitake 3 cloves garlic, minced 3 shallots, minced 1/2 tsp chili flake 5 1/2 tbsp braising liquid 3 tbsp cream 1 1/2 tbsp butter 8 stalks broccoli rabe 10 pieces 24-hour tomato 3 tbsp mixed olives 12 large basil leaves, torn 4 tsp olive oil 4 tbsp shaved pecorino In a sauté pan, heat a little canola oil, and cook the mushroom until it gets a little color. Add the shallots, garlic and chili flake. Deglaze with the braising liquid and add meat, olives, tomatoes, butter and rabe. In a separate pot, cook pasta until al dente. Let the liquid reduce until a little thick, then add cream, and reduce a little more. Toss in pasta until it's well coated with sauce. Finish with basil, olive oil and pecorino.

How to Get a Taste of DiFara's
AUTHOR:
Robert Sietsema
DATE:
2009-03-18 11:04:00
POST:
 This is what it looks like, kids. Read on to see how to get it. (And click to admire its vegetable fecundity) I first ate at DiFara's years ago in the company of Jim Leff, the chowhound.com founder whose most durable legacy is not his former website, but the elevation of a besieged neighborhood pizza parlor in Midwood to the status of greatest pizza in the world. Luckily, the bewilderd Dom was able to continue and even improve his slice under the bombardment of non-stop adulation, so that now his pizza is often even better (when he doesn't burn it) than it was a decade ago. I stepped into the sunny, herb-filled, disheveled room that is his pizzeria on a recent Saturday. There was a line out the door, but there were far more pizzaistas inside, drumming their fingers on the cracked formica tables, texting and twittering and allowing huge sighs to issue from their lips. "How long is the wait?" I asked the most despondent-looking of them, a middle-aged guy with a couple of small kids who later identified himself as a resident of Patchogue, who'd driven a long way to get a taste of the famous pizza. "Two hours for a pie," was his reply, the kids climbing up and down his arms and obviously famished. Well, five minutes later I was out in the street with a slice, smacking my lips at how good it tasted. How did I do it?  The trick is knowing what you're eating. DiFara's?has always been and remains a neighborhood pizza parlor. Neighborhood denizens need to be able to run in and grab a slice -- just like at a neighborhood pizza parlor. For that reason, Dom always has a pie working in the oven to be sold as slices. All the?people waiting are waiting for pies. It's like a macho thing -- they must score a whole pie?or the world will end.?Hence the absurd wait. Be content to have a single?slice straight from the oven, and don't be particular whether it's a Sicilian slice, a Neapolitan slice, or -- what the hell -- the fabled artichoke slice. It's only a neighborhood pizza parlor, after all. And no, I'm not going to tell you where it is. ? Related Content Related Stories...

@polecat: I once used a lawyer in Midwood and he also called it a "neighborhood joint" where his kid goes for slices. He didn't seem to see what the big deal was. @Robert: Never knew the slice trick, but it make sense. I once took a subway ride from Rego Park with a buddy just to stand in awe at the counter and watch Dom work, without ordering anything to eat!

This week in the Voice, Robert Sietsema drops in on Buttermilk Channel. Here's what critics are reviewing elsewhere: Time Out visits La Fonda del Sol, preferring tapas at the bar to a meal in the "buttoned-up" dining room, much like our own Sarah DiGregorio said last week. [TONY] Bruni gives Kefi one star, blaming an onslaught of saltiness for tiring out the palate. [NY Times] Adam Platt says Braeburn is not ambitious but also not bad, giving it one star. [NY Magazine] Restaurant Girl awards Casa La Femme three stars, deeming it exotic despite the "bland thin hummus." [NY Daily News] Alan Richman returns to Raoul's, where he says the steak au poivre is as satisfying as ever. [GQ at men.style.com]

 Quotes from the Food and Agriculture Summit included, "What I think the consumer wants is value at point of sale. They don't want a lot of fancy promotions. They don't want a lot of double packs. They want a reasonable price point." [Reuters] In a survey of 8,203 people across the country, 2.55 percent were found to suffer from food allergies. Analysis of the results showed that young black boys were four times more likely to have allergies than others. [U.S. News] With so many restaurants in New York City closing or struggling, the competition among chefs has stiffened. Many are seeking out other jobs within the industry, while others are resorting to reality TV auditions. [NY Times] Greenopia, a new service that rates the environmental impact and overall healthiness of fast food restaurants, launched yesterday. [MSNBC] Miley Cyrus' "Hannah Montana" snacks were pulled from supermarket shelves this week as part of the wider peanut-product salmonella scare. [SF Chronicle]

Commenting on Alice Waters

POST:
Of our own commenters, one points out that by cooking an egg over a roaring fire instead of in a pot, Waters may have expanded her carbon footprint considerably. Obviously, if you love good cooking and care about health and the environment, there's nothing objectionable in what Waters is saying. On the other hand, the way that she says it sometimes makes me cringe--and it does make her seem out of touch. You can't just brush off the issue of the higher cost of organic, local food with the comment that "some people buy Nike shoes." Maybe we should talk about how to get fresh, affordably priced produce into bodegas instead. In the end, it was a missed opportunity for Leslie Stahl to really push Waters to answer and address the class issues that are raised here. A more vigorous, less fluffy interview would have better served the cause of good, healthy food, in the end. I appreciate her message, her commitment, etc. But one of the things that bugs me about her, whenever she addresses the cost- and time-prohibitive nature of living this way, she brushes it off: it's incredibly fast, and people make decisions all the time about how to spend their money. "People buy very expensive shoes," she told Lesley Stahl. True, some people do. Some people do that. Other people have cheap shoes, very little luxury, and variable access. There are, for example, poor people in Wisconsin, where they can't get fresh local tomatoes and spinach and asparagus for reasonable prices, or at all, because of their economic situation, their transportation situation, the climate here in the midwest. My point is, I just feel like while she certainly tries to understand class issues, she just doesn't get it. When presented with arguments for eating food that is organic, local, unprocessed, etc., a lot people seem to get so defensive, as though they interpret her saying 'It would be better to eat locally grown, organic food' as 'You had better do things just like I do, or your wrong, and lazy.' Of course it's not possible for most people to do things just like she does, but there are ways to make an effort, and with a little planning, eat much better without sacrificing very much money or time. If you have the time and space to have a small vegetable patch in the garden, that's great. But she's not vilifying people who don't.

Anyone can have a garden, if they have some dirt and sunlight. Having an organic garden isn't rocket science. It's what gardeners did before all the chemical companies got involved to make money. Having fresh vegetables in any amount is so much better than anything you can buy in a store that was shipped in a truck. A garden is worth the work. It is good for the body and the soul.

60 Minute interview stated that Alice made a trip to France and was inspired to do what she is doing now. I spent some time in Europe not long ago and had the feeling they are living in a modern world on the edge of the "Third World". To cook over an open flame, to pick veggies out of the ground out back, to search the fields for a salad is not a luxury in the Third World countries, it is every day life. How about milking your own goat. Only in America would the life style of the under privlige be considered an espensive luxury. I rmember my mom making my shirts for school and hooking a rug for the dining room. Try that today, those are expensive hobbies now, but not in the Thrid World nations -- it is a matter of every day life. We had better our society holds together or we may all be luxurating in poverty and return to making all our own stuff. Hey, I'm building a brick oven in the back yard and I have been thinking about goat cheese a lot lately. Only in the USA, this is the only place to live, Peace.

In my experience, it is cheaper to eat well than to eat processed, off-the-shelf items from the supermarket. It requires learning kitchen skills, which Ms. Waters correctly pointed out many people lack these days. Most of what you are paying for is the cost of advertising, packaging, shipping, and merchandising the product. I say, give Ms. Waters a break; at this point, she isn't exactly on the winning side in the war against sick eating habits.

Speaking of meat-inspired toys, this adorable miniature butcher complete with hanging prosciutto and a whole pig's head was recently spotted on a street in Naples. Via San Gregorio Armeno in the center of town is filled with artisans selling similar figurines as part of the local tradition of elaborate nativity scenes. Not sure what this little guy has to do with the birth of Christ, but he's pretty darned adorable.

No trip to Napoli is complete without a visit to Via San Gregorio. The presepi (creche) figures are great, and the way they do presepi in Napoli, with contemporary references and irreverence, will surprise. Last time I was there I got a good laugh out of one piece -- a battery-operated executioner bringing down his blade on the neck of a figurine of Umberto Bossi, the leader of the racist & anti-southern Italian Northern League.

paul goyette @ Flickr Governor Paterson's proposal to widen wine sales throughout the state has gained yet another endorsement, this time from Newsday. A number of local newspapers have championed the idea, which would allow grocery stores in New York State to sell wine, a right that stores in 35 states already have. While the Newsday editorial expresses support for the proposal, it concedes that measures would have to be taken to protect liquor stores and wine merchants, suggesting allowing wine and spirits sellers to stock mixers and other accoutrement, such as cheese and olives. Other newspapers that have recently run op-eds supporting the proposal include the New York Post and Daily News. We hope that New York can at least keep up with Kentucky and Tennessee, both of which have recently put forth proposals to allow wine sales in grocery stores. We're already 25 years behind Iowa, the last state to widen their wine sales back in (gasp!) 1983. Come on, people... Iowa!

You need to get your facts straight. Tennessee is about to defeat this bill (again) this week. The other states that allow such sales either did so since Prohibition was repealed or were state owned operations. This is a unique situation that must be handled differently than in other states. Liquor stores have been forced to remain small, single unit operations because it suited NY. Now the state wants to change the rules and these same stores must be able to compete with global public companies. It's not about convenience either, as there is a liquor store next to almost every grocery store in New York. The Governor needs to follow our President's message of supporting small business, as this measure will certainly lead to business closings and unemployment. And do we really want wine in a gas station? Let's get real and look at the social cost of increasing the wine outlets by eight fold. There certainly will be more access to alcohol and it will almost certainly end up in the wrong hands. Understand the facts and the collateral damage before commenting and so you have to walk an extra 20 yards to get that bottle of wine, will it kill you? If it is a hardship, almost every store offers free delivery.

How did Martineau get her job? The poor journalism around this country is shocking. The bill in Kentucky is dead and for Tennessee it is on life support. Here is excerpt from USA Today: "In Kentucky, Democratic state Rep. Larry Clark, who offered a bill for the past two years to allow supermarkets to carry wine, said he became so frustrated with the process he did not try again this year. Republican Tennessee state Sen. Bill Ketron, who introduced a bill last year to allow grocery sales of wines, said the Legislature's fiscal review indicated the move could generate $17 million in tax revenue a year. Ketron said he has received positive feedback on the proposal, but he acknowledged that doesn't mean it will have a better fate than his last attempt, which stalled in committee during the 2008 legislative session." If Martineau had an ounce of intelligence, perhaps should could have done a little research into why no state has changed a law in the last 23 years. She could have also found out then after implementing in Washington State in 1970, alcohol abuse rose preciptiously. My seven year old could have put together a better story. With so many reporters at the unemployment office, it would be wise for Martineau to work a little harder next time

Sionth @ Flickr If you're planning to join the throngs of green-clad revelers later on today - provided you haven't already - we don't need to tell you what top Irish pubs will be packed. But if you prefer hosting your own St. Patrick's Day shindig, may we suggest an appropriate libation or two? Cocktail wunderkind David Wondrich suggests foregoing the ceremonial greenifying of a drink using crème de menthe or green Chartreuse and instead Irishing up a classic Manhattan recipe. Incorporate Irish whiskey, Italian vermouth and a dash of orange bitters for a decidedly not-green-hued Emerald. Junior Merino, the self-proclaimed Liquid Chef, shakes up a Pot O' Gold using G'Vine gin (the grape-based gin), Midori, fresh lime juice, pineapple juice, simple syrup and basil leaves. Garnish with a basil leaf and (lucky!) gooseberry coins. Or just keep things simple with a Black Velvet: Guinness. Champagne. Need we say more?

The Early Word -- Fatty Crab [Uptown]
AUTHOR:

POST:
 Saturday evening, just thinking about dinner before heading out to a rock club, I got a text from Zak Pelaccio: "Come up for some eats tonight," and later, by way of further incentive: "I have some baby lamb and some other fun." The carrion call of roast flesh was irresistible. I knew I couldn't review the place - Zak and I have been outer-borough eating buddies for years, since around the time he founded Chickenbone Café in Williamsburg - but that made the invitation all the more carefree for me. I could sit and enjoy a meal like a culinary civilian (or maybe I mean civil culinarian). I'd looked in the window during the interminable months while the place awaited completion, and had been somewhat put off at how large the place was. Of course, part of the appeal of the downtown original Fatty Crab lay in its roiling intimacy, and the idea that the small staff was cooking just for you. "This place really isn't that big," the affable chef said, sitting down across the table from me, the first time I'd seen him in chef's whites in a while. I looked through the hole punched in the brick wall at the other dining room, and had to admit that the seating was really only about double that of the original, but there was also a large bar, which lay at right angles to the northernmost dining room. When I arrived around 7, the bar was mobbed with patrons waiting for tables. I saw Upper West Siders looking curiously at rabbit nuggets fried and doused with green garlic and chile (a special), and Singaporean black pepper mussels (a regular selection). It turns out that the old bill of fare has been retained but pushed toward the back of the menu, while the front page lists "Fatty's Specials," which are apparently recipes in the experimental stages. Naturally, I wanted to sample all the new stuff. A dish named pork skin and mackerel nam prik turned out to be one of those meat-laced dips - almost the color and texture of chunky peanut butter, but with a pork flavor as intense as a tactical nuke - that I associate with Cambodia. Ranked alongside a saucer of dip were little hanks of dipping veggies, including raw jicama, poached haricots vert, and a half-dozen others. The aforementioned lamb was more in a entrée vein, with several body parts stacked in a plum-red sauce that might have qualified as a Thai curry except for a certain non-sweet subtlety. The long ribs, delicately rimmed with fat, were the best. Finally, after eating those two dishes and feeling about as full as I could be, along came the fatty dog. "We make the XO sausage ourselves," Zak said, referring to a spicy and fishy flavoring that originated somewhere on the Malay peninsula, but become beloved of Hong Kong cooks. The dog was dressed like a Chicago red hot with rabies, featuring hot pickled chiles, pickled radish discs, and a French aioli. "Man, this is good," I exclaimed as a little nugget of dog shot out of the bun and landed in my lap.

Getting bored with the ol' EVOO? Lately, we've been sauteeing, pan searing and drizzling with avocado oil instead. It's the vegetable oil with the highest smoke point - around 520 degrees F - so you can turn on the heat without getting smoked out of the kitchen. Because it's made of avocados, it boasts the health benefits you might expect: antioxidants, omega 3 fatty acids. As a bonus, the mild, sweet taste doesn't interfere with that you're cooking. Oh, and it's a pretty green color, too. We've tried two brands - Apalta and Opalo - both from Chile, which apparently exports quite a bit of the stuff. It's a little pricey to make it your regular cooking oil, but is worth adding to your arsenal. We like sauteeing green beans and cherry tomatoes in avocado oil with a little salt, pepper and a squeeze of lemon to have over rice. When we're feeling healthy, that is.

Quench your financial woes with a Broke & Tan, Blackberry Sling or Trickle-down Punch. But The Boston Globe isn't being so coy with its timely tipple story. Apparently, Bonfire, a local bar, is poking fun at New York's fallen Yankees with the A-Roid: a shot of El Mejor tequila, neat, with a spicy "performance-enhancing" tomato juice chaser. It's part of the seasonal Red Sox menu, naturally.

Mount Gay Rum is gearing up to launch its newest - and oldest! - rum yet. Mount Gay Rum 1703 Old Cask Selection will be available in May, just in time for the first warm-weather cocktails to make an appearance. Not that you should be wasting the $100-a-bottle rum on Tiki drinks. Brand ambassador and Barbados Bartender of the Year, Chesterfield Brown, calls it a sipping rum. Made of a blend of rums aged 10 to 30 years, the 1703 was named for the year the distillery was founded. We liked the dried fruit and nutmeg notes but aren't sure we'd shell out for an entire bottle. On the other hand, we do hope to see more "sipping rums" on drink menus. Look out for 1703 at such Hospitality Holdings establishments as The Campbell Apartment at Grand Central Terminal, World Bar and The Carnegie Club.

Deep Waters: Slow Food Maven on 60 Minutes
AUTHOR:

POST:
The mother of the slow food movement in the U.S., Alice Waters, was featured on 60 Minutes yesterday in what was a somewhat bland piece on her legacy and vision for an America that eats and cooks local, organic and sustainable food. "Say 'frozen' and Alice Waters shudders," pronounces correspondent Leslie Stahl. In the segment, Waters feeds the cameraman, makes Stahl a wood-fire cooked breakfast and shops for rather expensive grapes at the fruit and vegetable garden in front of San Francisco's City Hall. Waters came up with the idea for the garden and has called for a similar setup at the White House for years. "How can you not love Alice Waters?" proclaims SF Mayor Gavin Newsom. Stahl tries throughout the segment to get Waters to admit that her way of eating is out of reach for many Americans, but Waters doesn't budge. "Everybody deserves this food. And that's not elitist," she says. Reactions to the 60 Minutes profile have ranged from sympathetic to scoffing.

I thoroughly enjoyed Lesley's Alice Waters segment. I understand the critisism over the cost of organic foods, but there were so many other important points made, like; grow your own food, buy local produce(saves fuel, saves the environment), start a garden at your kid's school, and stop buying "fast foods." In the movie "Supersize Me" a school for troubled kids was featured. They feed the students only whole foods in the cafeteria. The "bad kids" were so well behaved and the "good kids" were running wild in their traditional high school cafeteria. There's an old saying, you are what you eat.

I agree with Mark. I remember meeting Alice Waters over ten years ago at a "foodie" benefit in LA and told her what a pleasure it was to meet her. I asked her about that same hearth [having seen it in a kitchen design book].....how often something like that really is used. I asked so nicely - thinking how charming such a hearth would be but wondering also how frivilous. She just looked at me like I had three heads. Honestly - she just glared at me - shocked that I had even addressed her and asked a question of about something other than the dish her staff were serving up at their booth. Incidentally, I was the only person in line at that time, so it was not a matter of being preoccupied. She never answered my question. That lady has a serious "tude" and she showed it well on the segment with Leslie Stahl.

I’m guessing that all of the Alice Waters lovers out there are over-looking the obvious fact that, in making her and Leslie Stahl breakfast by cooking two eggs over a wood-fired hearth in a kitchen, she now has a carbon-footprint about 1000 times bigger than she would had she simply fried them in a pan? What a hypocrite this woman is! She sneers when Leslie Stahl asks about her not owning a Microwave and then builds a wood-fire to cook two eggs!!!!! She and Al Gore ought to install one of those wood-fired ovens in his carbon-footprint busting mansion! I guess if you can afford the carbon offsets, who cares, right? All the above proves, without a doubt, that she is an elitist. By the way, I have eaten at her restaurant downstairs and her “bistro” upstairs. They are good, but not remotely one of the best in the country and very expensive.

I agree with Mark and Deborah. Wood stove? Hope no one has asthma nor wants asthma. I think growing a few things ourselves is nice if you have the climate and resources to do so. I will hope in an attempt to keep people employed, and yes, even those drivers who deliver food, that we don't get carried away. I knew she was impressed with herself but sorry to hear how she handled Deborah's question. Her restaurant menu is more interesting than it is great food.

No, these teens are not victims of some senseless bloody attack -- they're celebrating Phagwah, also known as Holi or the Festival of Colors, a Hindu festival commemorating the escape of Prahlad, a devotee of Lord Vishnu, from Hoilka, a demon who carried the lad into a bonfire. She perished while he survived unharmed. Celebrants of this festival -- which falls every year on the full moon in late February or early March -- throw colored powders on each other, and squirt each other with super soakers filled with colored water. Hilarity prevails on every hand. The participants are mainly Caribbeans from Trinidad, Guyana, and Suriname of south Asian heritage.  A parade commemorates the holiday, with floats representing the Hindu temples of the city. It begins at 133rd Street and Liberty Avenue in Richmond Hill and wends its way to Smokey Oval Park on Atlantic Avenue. In the above float (click to enlarge),?a lion head represents Lord Vishnu, and a sign on the side of the cow reads, "Love Your Mother Protect?The Cows."

 After coming down hard on the government's inadequate inspection of food processing plants, President Obama has vowed to improve food safety by reorganizing the FDA and tightening regulations. And who has he enlisted to help him? None other than former New York City health commissioner, Dr. Margaret A. Hamburg. [NY Times] The Cassoulet Festival held at Savoy this past weekend celebrated slow food and the quintessentially French dish. Chefs from Inside Park, Cookshop, Mas Farmhouse and Diner submitted dishes, which included such non-traditional ingredients as partridge sausage, goat belly, tasso and kumquats. [Metromix] Beloved East Village dive bar Lucy's reopened its doors to a full house on Friday evening after being shuttered for several weeks. [Grub Street] Sushi lovers who feel guilty for indulging in largely unsustainable species of fish will be pleased to hear that a more sustainable Kindai Bluefin from Japan can now be found on the menu at Monterey Bay Fish Grotto in Virginia. [Washington Post] Overprotective moms might want to rethink the lengths they go to to avoid having their peanut-allergic kids come into contact with the deadly legumes.

This truck, which has been parking itself along East 20th between Broadway and Park Avenue lately, demonstrates the principal: If you're going to lie,?lie big.    The ironically named New York Hot Dog and Coffee is really a Korean chain, and business has been a little slow. It seems consumers strolling down Bleecker would glance inside, wonder what the hell a bulgogi dog was, then walk on. Well, this glass case recently pushed out onto the sidewalk answers those sorts of questions in beautiful 3-D. File this in the category of Fads That Won't Die: Seen on Sixth Avenue just south of West Eight, the humongous birthday cake cookie lives! Photos by G1, click to enlarge.

Smuggling Chocolate?
AUTHOR:

POST:
USA Today reports that a Canadian couple were recently arrested in the Toronto airport, and their baby taken from them as they were led away in handcuffs. Their crime: Trying to fly with a pound-and-a-half of chocolate. Rube?customs agents tested it with one of their junior science kits and it tested positive -- for hashish! And these same agents apparently couldn't tell the difference. It turns out that cops, customs personnel, and drug enforcement agents often use these kinds of questionable field tests, which, according to the article, turn up false positives all the time. For example, rosemary = marijuana,?and?liquid soap = date-rape drug GBH. How can you protect yourself from these sorts of insults to your intelligence? Don't fly. Or "smoke" the chocolate before you return from your vacation.

As a huge fan of "Top Chef," and "Next Food Network Star," I was sure I could get my reality cooking show fix before "NFNS" starts this summer. Alas, it is not to be. First, I did not understand anything that was going on. The cheftestants on "Top Chef," who curse a lot, are choir boys/girls compared to that group last night. One review of the show I read said that the contestants looked like they had just wandered in from a food court. Agreed. What a thoroughly unlikeable group. Led by a man, of whom I have never heard of, and hope never to hear of again. I read his bio - what a thoroughly disgusting man. Good news is that now I don't have to tape the Daily Show on Wednesdays.

M.P.W is the man. Coliccio could only dream to some day be as bad ass a chef as Marco. The man won three stars and five red knives and forks in the michellen guide. The youngest chef ever to do it. He is a gastronmy god, and should be treated as such.

What just happened? I could barely follow the mismatched segments that seemed haphazardly pieced together, like a bad patchwork quilt. I didn't care about the participants, didn't understand why I am watching couples, hated the silly graphics, and thought that White was portrayed as waaaay to unlikeable. There are too many cooking shows to tune in to... if you're going to add another one, make it at least as good as those. This is surely not.

The Chopping Block is a cheap, dramatized version of Top Chef. What they lack in cookie ability, they try to make up with in drama. I totally agree that as a whole the group is unlikeable. The only ones I like are Michael and Panya, they are the only ones who don't seem to stir up drama.

Parent or no, you're probably as tired as I am of all the chi-chi baby stores that have popped up around town during the last decade, flaunting cutesy $50 t-shirts and strollers with thousand-dollar price tags that force the hapless offspring to look their parents right in the eye during the entire trip, rather than scanning the horizon for a chance to escape. But who can argue that these gold-plated baby accessories are actually psychologically harmful? Aside from making the child of entitlement want more entitlement, right from the get-go? Then, as I was ambling down Bleecker Street this morning, I?saw in a shop window?a baby accessory so pernicious (and so food-related) that I thought I must share it with you: bottle cozies made to look like semi-realistic?animals. Now, in addition to the choice between a lifeless, scientific-looking bottle and the human breast, the baby can be given a further choice of sucking nourishment?from the face of a pig or whatever you think that other animal is. It's like the she-panther nursing Mowgli in Jungle Book. That's worth six years on the analyst's couch, minimum. ?

A Semen Cookbook

POST:
 Maybe you hoped we were through writing about things like breast milk ice cream, but alas, the bodily fluid culinary notions just will not stop.A friend pointed me to this self-publishing site, where someone (supposedly) named Fotie Photenhauer has taken it upon themselves to write Natural Harvest: A Collection of Semen Based Recipes. The book includes ideas such as filling empty oyster shells with semen for "man-made oysters" and stuffing crepes with a mixture of cottage cheese, sugar and semen. Quoth Natural Harvest: Semen is not only nutritious, but it also has a wonderful texture and amazing cooking properties. Like fine wine and cheeses, the taste of semen is complex and dynamic. Semen is inexpensive to produce and is commonly available in many, if not most, homes and restaurants. Despite all of these positive qualities, semen remains neglected as a food.Now, we all know this is a joke (right?...right??), but I can't help but point out that the recipes are actually usable, if not exactly appetizing. We do eat things like duck and calf testicles, which (I suppose) contain tiny duck and cow sperm, and Sietsema recently enjoyed cod sperm at the John Dory...

What he actually said was that there is a simple test, a brush that a dentist could rub on the spot and send to a lab that would have told them that the white dot on his tongue was actually pre-cancerous. Then, it could have been easily cut out and it never would have developed into a cancer.

And how much did he and his (behind the scenes) business partner get paid for the mention of the brush test (which is of dubious value) from the manufacturer - Oral CDx - to do that mention? Achatz seems like a good guy, and like many that fight this disease, he knows it is a difficult fight, and the story about late discovery and misdiagnosis needs to be told. ESPECIALLY the early detection story, because dentists and medical doctors are NOT as engaged in early discovery as they should be. But the issue is NOT about this brush test making any serous contribution to changing things. It is useless without the precursor need for DISCOVERY to find something to put the brush on! The problem is doctors are not opportunistically screening their patient populations for any precancerous (let alone early stage disease) conditions. This isn't my opinion, just look at the peer reviewed published studies in the National Institutes of Health /NIDCR by Horowitz et al that show how few dentists actually screen, know where to look, and know what to look for. Without a desire of the profession to engage in discovery through screening, and an informed population that knows about the disease, (who mostly have never even heard of it), the brush test is a mute point. It is about DISCOVERY at early survivable stages when morbidity and death rates are at the lowest, and existing treatments the most effective. DIAGNOSIS cannot take place even with this little brush ( which is a far cry from the gold standard incisional biopsy) if there is no screening visually and tactilely first. There have also been numerous peer reviewed articles about the limited value of some of these adjunctive "tests" that question their value in the Journal of the American Dental Association. Even the NY Times has done a story in the last 8 weeks questioning their value. Achatz gets my vote and praise for spreading public awareness. As to also promoting a particular test, I am less enthusiastic, and question his motives for even mentioning it as a lay person.

My uncle has this exact cancer that this Chef had. He was diagnosed March 2008 and has already been through chemo and radiation. He had a feeding tub inserted and had a tracheotomy done almost a year ago. Nothing has been cured or gotten any better. Two weeks ago we found out the cancer has spread to his jaw bone and he was told that he has 6 months or less to live. What I want to know is what chemo did this Chef take and what procedures were taken? With experiencing all this with my uncle, it is sad to see there is only hope for those who have the money to afford it while those who don't have to be satisfied with loss.   If you have ANY information please please let me know. ashleykkelley@yahoo.com

yes, i believe that's what i said when i wrote (but didn't quote Achatz directly) that "If it had been properly diagnosed years prior when he first asked doctors about it, the pre-cancerous spot could have simply been scraped off..." Achatz spoke of both doctors and dentists disregarding his concerns about the spot on his tongue.

Steve, the particular test you say he was "promoting" could have prevented his whole ordeal if his dentist had tested the spot as soon as it was shown to him. You are absolutely correct that dentists must focus on the DISCOVERY of tissue changes. But in order to truly prevent a cancer, a spot must be caught while it is still dysplastic - i.e. before it advances to cancer. Given this reality, what is a dentist to do - scalpel biopsy every tissue change he/she sees, when the overwhelming majority of spots are absolutely harmless? Should he/she "watch and wait" until the spot turns ugly - at which point it is usually too late? The brush test solves the dilema of what a dentist should do with his/her potentially important DISCOVERY. Kudos to chef Achatz for alerting the public to these tiny spots that could be lurking in all of our mouths.

Kelley, so sorry about your uncle. I share your gripe about the rich buying a chance to live. After all, would a university "reverse the protocol" of treatment for me or you? Of course not! Does that mean our lives (or your uncle's) is any less valuable? Hardly! I take some solace in what Dr. Oz said on the show - that Chef Grant not only acted on his own behalf, but on behalf of those that are behind him. In that respect more power to him for bringing his story out into the open.

POST:
This week, Counter Culture rolls into Mustang Thakali Kitchen?in Jackson Heights, an amazing new restaurant with a pan-Himalayan menu, though one also specializing in the Mustang region of Nepal, up near the border with Tibet. Though there's plenty of lamb and chicken, and many vegetarian dishes, the starches stand at the center of many of the thali-based meals. Bhatmas chiura is a salad of small toasted soybeans, with a whomp of cilantro, purple onions, and chiles. A pile of beaten rice arrives on the side. The starchy steamed buns called ting momo?come covered with mountain ridges. Mutton fry is a meat-lover's delight. Perhaps the most amazing starch of all is the poodle of?whipped and kneaded?buckwheat flour known as yohsi. Our crew one evening. And, finally, the scary kids who forced us to run past the window of the sari shop. (Click to freak yourself out.)

The lemon juice packet is for the palabok, not the fried chicken. Filipinos like to squeeze sour citrus juice over their noodles, typically from the kalamansi fruit, but lemon juice is an acceptable substitute.

Man, when the first time i went to that place, it was pack, crazy! . Then, i ordered some chicken joys (wasn't satisfied though) and the aloha cheeseburger and beefy (were delicious). But the price quite expensive but it's worth enough to eat their food. I LOVE IT! Definitely Im going back there again when I have time.

The Early Word -- Tasty Hand-Pulled Noodle Inc.
AUTHOR:
Robert Sietsema
DATE:

POST:
The prodigal peel noodles at Tasty Hand-Pulled (click to enlarge) There are at least ten joints in greater Manhattan Chinatown that specialize in Lanzhou hand-pulled noodles. The latest entree in the sweepstakes is Tasty Hand-Pulled Noodle Inc. (note the fussy punctuation), on Doyers in the oldest part of Chinatown. If you've read Luc Sante's Low Life, you know that this short curving street is where the hatchet gangs of the late 19th century -- the forerunners of modern tongs -- stalked their prey, and then escaped through a secret passage to Mott Street. The small dining room is more comfortable than the early Lanzhou slingers, and there's a waitress who speaks good English. While not on the menu, the rarely seen peel noodles are also offered (here called "knife peel noodles"), in common with Sheng Wang on Eldridge Street. The peel noodles are advertised in the window. Whether you order hand-pulled noodles or peel noodles, there's a choice of many add-ins, and the bowl shown above demonstrates what a great collection of ingredients lands in the completed bowl, including pickled mutton, mustard greens, baby bok choy, baby spinach, and an optional fried egg. For four or five dollars, it's a complete meal. 1 Doyers Street, 212-791-1817 Watch out for the hatchet gangs!

Incredibly Cheap Eats -- Samosas
AUTHOR:
Robert Sietsema

POST:
And don't forget, in this era of belt-tightening and culinary retrenchment, the lowly samosa. These golden rhomboidal fritters, filled with a fortifying mixture potatoes and peas, making them both vegetarian and vegan, were probably inspired during the colonial era by Cornish pasties, which were in turn inspired by Spanish empanadas. At $1 each, two make a magnificent meal, especially if you nip off one corner and pour in the yogurt-cilantro sauce provided alongside. In the version from Tribeca's?Pakistan Tea House, you'll find a few flakes of red pepper in the filling. 176 Church Street, 212-240-9800 ?

Just a correction here. According to the Oxford Companion to Food, samosas probably actually came to India from central Asia/Fertile Crescent/ Egypt. MUCH earlier than the colonial era. Not everything comes from Europe

a. Take it up with Oxford. I dare say they may have more expertise than you or I. b. The pie crust? You mean flakey dough with butter? Gee how could anyone had thought of that before. That's hardly proof of provenance. I'm not saying that samosas havent changed but to say the idea of wrapping stuff in dough comes from Europe is ridiculous. Take a look at the sweatmeats from Persia and the Fertile Crescent, take at look at Egyptian and Iranian meat pies.Take a look at at India, the Moduk or or the Kranji both sweets pictured with the elephant god Ganesh...and this is for centuries and centuries before the Brits came. Maybe he went to Europe with his elephant head and nosed out some french pastries...he is ab it of a glutton. Every culture has their own version of the dumpling, fried or steamed or whatever. To say it ALL comes from colonial European infleunce is a short sighted way and of looking at things. c. Sure everything came from somewhere else, but why does everything have to come from Europe? Europeans didn't even have black pepper before they got in their ships to take it from the East. So I expect everytime your write about something with flavor, you credit the spice basket of central and southern Asia.

By the way, what we both missed, and what really distinguishes a samosa from, say, a Cornish pasty or an Egyptian sambusak, is not the pastry or the filling but the shape, and it is the shape that makes the samosa uniquely Indian. There is no other shape quite like it in the culinary world. I don't even know how to describe it. It's a twisted tetrahedron with triangular faces, and whoever came up with it was a mathematical genius. What purpose does the shape serve? It makes it possible to cook it in a pan in shallow fat and brown every surface, while maximizing the amount of filling per quantity of dough.

Then how do you explain the conventional, European-style pie crust that enfolds the samosa? Just because the idea didn't originate in South Asia, doesn't mean that the samosa is not incredibly good, and incredibly Indian. I get the same complaints when I note the French crepe antecedents of dosas. Almost everything originally came from somewhere else.

Well you daresay wrong. The Oxford Companion is filled with small and large errors, including just what you've accused me of -- Eurocentrism. In fact, whether you like Europe or not, the Europeans -- including English, French, Germans, and Portuguese, were all over India for centuries, and the cuisine that came from a melding of Indian regional styles with European influences is one of the greatest cuisines in the world. Beer? Brought to India by Germans. Dosa? At least partly influenced by the French crepe. The potatoes in the masala dosas? Came from South America on Potuguese ships. Chiles and tomatoes? Also from South America. When I'm arguing a point about Indian food, I don't refer to the Oxford Companion to Food -- that would be Eurocentric. I look in Indian Food: A Historical Companion by K.T. Achaya, and then I know the food that was there before the colonialists dropped by. In this lengthy volume there's not a word about samosas, indicating that Dr. Achaya doesn't even consider it Indian food. To me, the "short" crust -- clearly made with butter rather than ghee -- is so unlike any other pastry crust found in Persia, or the Middle East, which is either phyllo based or made with an crust that is often entirely unfatty -- like the Lebanese spinach pie (which may also be influenced by the empanada). Thanks so much for opening up this debate!

Those %#!& Tip Jar Inscriptions
AUTHOR:
Robert Sietsema
DATE:
2009-03-6 12:31:00
POST:
photo courtesy of rottnpagan  ?Of the many indignities suffered by consumers in the first decade of the 21st century, the tip jar inscription is not the largest, but it may be the most annoying. I got to thinking about the subject after a friend emailed me complaining about the enthusiastic sign on the tip jar at a Mexican carryout in his neighborhood: "Thank you in advance for the generous tips you will give us as a result of our Excellent Service!" My friend noted, "I am a generous tipper, but that makes me want to stiff them," and I had to agree. The dictionary defines a tip as "to bestow a gratuity," and a gratuity as "something given voluntarily or beyond obligation." Clearly, the inscription tries to remove the "voluntary" part by demanding a tip. And further tries to wheedle you into being "generous." Of course, this inscription is ham-fisted, and probably results in consumers giving less than usual. How did the tip jar originate? While tipping has long been a custom confined to waiters, supers, and delivery people, tip jars started appearing on the counters of retail establishments with the advent of coffee bars. Baristas reasoned, "I'm kind of a waiter, and kind of a bartender, why shouldn't I supplement my meager salary with tips as those professions do?" Soon, other retail establishments besides coffee bars got into the act, and we began seeing tip jars on the counters of bakeries, bodegas, carryout restaurants, and other retail food-related establishments that never had a tipping program before. While the jars may have been introduced by underpaid employees, the owners of these businesses must have rubbed their hands in glee, in contemplation of the raises they wouldn't have to pay as a result of tip jars swelling with greenery. As years have gone by I've seen the practice become more refined and nuanced. For example, I've seen counterpeople "priming" the tip jar at the outset of their shifts by borrowing a few dollars from the register and fluffing them up in the jar. While the original tip jar was ostensibly to collect the handful of change that remained after a transaction, suddenly change was not sufficient, and the pile of green suggested to the consumer that dollars were the proper remembrance for the staff. I started looking around for examples of horrible tip jar inscriptions. While many are intended to be humorous, the underlying message is clear: Give generously, or else! Perhaps you can supplement my list with even better ones. (Several of these inscriptions are gleaned from photos on the web, hence the lack of attribution.) "Karma is a boomerang." - seen in a coffee bar. "Tipping is soooooo sweet" - seen in a cupcake bakery, with a picture of a tiny cupcake underneath. "Tipping - Its not just for cows and outhouses!" - seen in a Chinese carryout, with a smiley face. "Good tippers make great lovers." - unknown locale, with a heart and the further inscription "True!" "Show us your tips!" - unknown locale. "Tip $, because $4 a gallon is killing us!" - seen in a bakery. "Thanks - a latte!" - seen in a coffee bar, with little stickers that say "Joy." "Support Counter Intelligence." - unknown locale. "TIPS, NO LIPS PLEASE" - unknown locale. "This neato fruit puppet demands hard currency in exchange 4 sparing your worthless life." - unknown locale. "Tipping makes it hurt less." - in a piercing parlor. "Take a penny, leave a dollar." - unknown locale. "Tipping is sexy." - in a coffee bar. And, perhaps the worst of all: "If you have no change for a tippity-tip, FEAR NOT!!! We also accept: Cigs, Vegan Candies, Pretty Flowers, Phone #s, Clip-on neckties, glow sticks, used fortunes, and so on." - unknown locale Related Content Related Stories...

I say if it's staffed by students, tip jars are OK; when I was on the other side of the counter, tips paid for my food and my paycheck went towards rent. Plus, my managers, who were either students or recent grads didn't skim a percentage and I actually got a fair share, unlike the restaurant I worked at at night.

This is a subject that has long baffled me--the people that work over a smoking hot grill at say, a McDonald's don't get compensated through tips and their jobs are arguably a tad harder than say someone whipping up a coffee beverage-different mentality of the establishment perhaps?

You are all so wrong. Wait staff work is at the lowest pay, because tips are considered a part of their pay from their employer. People as your last post who said if they had something to go and don't tip are totally wrong. You didn't make that cup of coffee that you could have made at home if you weren't lazy or late or whatever your excuse. You could have cooked your food as well. Instead you rely on a company or "a service employee" to make your life/day great??? That deserves gratuity

I worked at a counter once and the tip jar read "We work for minimum wage and your tips."

If I come to a venue, purchase a cup of something or food to go, that equals no tip.

Revisit: Diberterie Cheikh
AUTHOR:
Robert Sietsema
DATE:
2009-03-6 9:03:00
POST:
Two years ago, when I reviewed newcomer Dibiterie Cheikh, I found the place to be on the very cusp of innovation: It was?the first Senegalese restaurant to consistently offer appetizers, in this case, little half-moon pies stuffed with smoked herring called fataya, and pork-free Vietnamese spring rolls known as nems. In the process of studying how the Senegalese national dish of cheb (more formally, tiebou dienne) has evolved in New York, I recently paid a revisit. I went at lunch, when traditional tribal dishes of the Wolof are served, including cheb, mafe, and yassa. Cheb is an over-rice dish of fish and vegetables probably descended from paella. When I first started eating it in New York over 15 years ago, it was colored bright red with palm oil. In the ensuing time, the palm oil has disappeared in response to a general perception on the part of Senegalese cooks that palm oil is unhealthy. The Maggi sauce that used to be on every Senegalese table has disappeared, too, at first in favor of ketchup. Now the ketchup is gone. Though the cheb is served around two in the afternoon, you can also usually get the leftovers in the evening, even though the evening menu is more like a West African spin on French cooking. I ate it in the afternoon, and noted the changes the dish has undergone. First, the rice (Southeast Asian broken rice is used for this dish, and this dish only) has decreased in volume, so that now the chunks of fish and vegetables eclipse it. Second, the quantity and variety of vegetables has increased, once again in line with ideas about the healthfulness of vegetables, but also because, back in Senegal, vegetables were a more prominent part of the national dish, and now the Senegalese cooks can indulge that passion. Earlier versions of cheb were more spare and functional. Third, the fish (bluefish in this case) had been steamed rather than fried, making the cheb far less oily. My friend and I also sampled thiou, a dish of oblong fish "meatballs" in a thick dark tomato sauce. It was scrumptious, and Dibiterie Cheikh remains your best place to get Senegalese food in town. But watch out for the Scotch bonnet pepper!  ?

Lately, I've been crazy busy with the businness. I am getting tons of request for licensing my image to some big company. So far I got Ducati, the company that produces all Italia motorbikes, I will launch as a spokeperson for Dr. Oetker, a new line of frozen high quality pizza all over United States. I also got a huge deal with Pellegrino water, and Gail Simmons from Food & Wine. I will be with her launching the national campaign "The Sparkling Life," plus I'm dealing also with Red Bull and Don Q Rum, and on top of this I've been requested to do all kinds of talk shows. It's overwelming the love and interest that I'm getting from everybody. I've done Ellen DeGegeneres and The Bonnie Hunt Show so far, and I have several more in line waiting, plus we are also thinking to do a possible TV show with me involved (just thinking). Without counting that I'm opening two more restaurants in the Ventura County area in the summer and i'm starting a 14-city book tour in all the major book stores around the United States in April and May for my Cafe Firenze Cookbook, and i'm working on my second book. My son is on Google: Recipes and Memories from an Italian Mom. I'm doing this with the help of my mom off course. She will tell America all the funny and sad stories and recipes that made her happy or cry since the day that I was born, so as you can see I don't have much time left for hang out with my buddy Stefan and i miss him a lots!!!! Ohhhh I forgot, I'm also almost ready to launch my Web site www.kidshealthcafe.com, in order to promote good nutrition and wellness for kids.

One of my neighbors recommended to go to Gialeti's so I stopped by for lunch with my sister and we both had panini and shared one of their gourmet shrimp salads and it was absolutely delicious.  I also ordered the carrot cake to go with a latte and I was very satisfied.  I would definately go back.  Sorry to hear about the pistachio wafer.

The Early Word -- DeFonte's

POST:
It seemed like a miracle -- an obscure hero shop in the mean back streets of Red Hook, one of the foremost purveyors of the legendary Italian roast beef hero, suddenly pops up in Gramercy Park. How would a working class hero look dressed up in a tux? I worried as I peddled over to Defonte's on my bike, risking my neck as I slid through the copious slush that still lined the streets. On my first visit, I directed all my attention to that signature roast beef hero, even though a half dozen cold heroes and two dozen hot heroes are offered from a long steam table that constitutes a museum of warm meat. There are salads and a few baked pastas, too. The place is much more well staffed than the original Brooklyn location, with identically dressed sandwich fixers lined up shoulder-to-shoulder behind the gleaming counter. The sandwich has the regulation wad of rare roast beef, and slice of fresh mozzarella, which is made on the premises and way rich. Standing in for the brown gravy, which comes from a can in many Brooklyn examples (I raced around?documenting the?Brooklyn roast beef phenomenon back in 2002, and stumbled on the original DeFonte's, founded 1922, soon thereafter), is a delicate broth, which the menu is pleased to call "natural jus." (The French term is evidence of the effect Gramercy Park has had on this sainted sandwich shop, I suppose.)?The jus is spread on one side of the loaf as the sandwich is prepared. DeFonte's innovation, by the way,?is adding?thin slices of fried eggplant to the sandwich. One bite and I nearly fell off the bar stool. "Shit! this is good," I couldn't help exclaiming out loud. The sandwich is beyond magnificent, and the?challenge of reproducing a facsimile of the?hero in an unfamiliar neighborhood has been met with flying colors. Can this new joint succeed in this neighborhood of iffy food??Don't wait to find out -- grab this sandwich immediately. At $9.95, it's pricey, but one sandwich with a side of slaw easily feeds two. 261 Third Avenue, 212-614-1500 ??

Bacon makes everything better. There was a delightful post on cooksillustrated.com about a bacon party - I kid you not - and one of the best ideas was to weave a lattice work of bacon into a muffin cup, place another muffin tin on top and bake it. The bacon cups could be used for mashed potatoes or a lettuce and tomato salad. By the way, I can't tell you how much I enjoy your blog and reviews.

Pix from La Superior
AUTHOR:

POST:
This week's Counter Culture covers La Superior, a Williamsburger Mexican restaurant that adapts a pan-national menu for New York tastes, a feat we dub "Goth-Mex," short for "Gothamite-Mexican." Despite a general dearth of chiles, the food is very Mexican, expertly juggling cacti, masa, and?beans. One highpoint are the tinga tacos, three to an order: A selection of the Mexican fondues called queso fundidos regales you with dippable cheesy goodness. This one is topped with chorizo: In this slightly out-of-focus shot (don't blame me, my hands were covered with salsa), we see a biweekly special of tlaycoyos, a boat-shaped pre-Columbian blue masa pancake from Puebla?surmounted by avocado and oodles of fresh cactus. Finally, another special, enchiladas mineras, comes from Guanajuato in north central Mexico, a pair of prone, sauce-dipped tortillas topped with salad and an optional piece of spice-rubbed roast chicken:

It's actually divided across the county line. The restaurants I wrote about are in Queens, in the neighborhood of Floral Park. Just across the county line is the village of Floral Park, which is in Nassau County. The village and the neighborhood are adjacent, but in different counties, the former in Queens, the latter in Nassau. Confusing, but a delicious place to eat.

McD's doesn't own Chipotle anymore. I loooove me some Chipotle but you couldn't get anything in the tortilla if you wanted it to be even vaguely healthy. At almost 300 calories with 9 grams of fat, it's like a meal in itself!

Tired of the Drunken Negro Face cookie and its profound ramifications for racial harmony? Well, when I was downing my baguettines at Amy's Bread this morning, I saw it, like a vision beaming down from heaven -- the blessed Obama bread! But wait, is it respectful to plaster a president's puss on a round loaf of bread? Even if it isn't the Shephard Fairey likeness?

Strange Snacks of the World -- Scrapple
AUTHOR:
Robert Sietsema
DATE:
2009-03-3 8:45:00
POST:
During my recent sojourn in rural south-central Pennsylvania, I had the chance to reacquaint myself with scrapple. Like Spam, it is a meat invented in America based on pig. But unlike Spam, which has traveled the world and become a celebrity, scrapple remains an obscure?regional dish. In addition to the Keystone State, you can sometimes find it in Delaware and Maryland, too. Scrapple is made by boiling pig offal (the head, organs, trotters, etc.) in a huge pot until all the meat has fallen off the bones. The inedible parts (mainly bones and excess fat) are then removed and a combo of cornmeal and buckwheat are added, along with herbs like sage and savory. The mixture is boiled until it reaches the consistency of mush and the color of lead, which is then formed into a rectangular loaf?for slicing. Scrapple is corny and funky and greasy, and is usually eaten for breakfast as a kind of poor-person's bacon or sausage. It was invented by a culture (Pennsylvania Dutch?) where nothing was wasted, and frugality was considered the greatest virtue. Scrapple could teach us a lesson, if only we could bring ourselves to eat it.

Homemade scrapple is probably tastier than it sounds. Americans snub pig offal, but it can be excellent. Sizzling Sisig is ear meat. Crispy pata is pig's foot. Upon ordering pig intestine at a Chinese stall, I was warned that Americans don't eat that. Then that is their loss. Still I wouldn't touch the lump called scrapple at the 99 cent store. At Ecuadoran stalls in Queens, the pig's head is displayed proudly.

I'd never had scrapple until just a few years ago, but was really impressed with what I had. Something a little bit like black and white pudding, but bacony. I love the stuff now, even after watching a Food Network show about how it was made. They wouldn't let the cameras into the big "vat of pig parts" boiling room, though.

growing up in philadelphia scrapple was a staple. it can be baked, broiled and pan fried, depending on whether you prefer crispiness or mealiness. as a kid, i could never get enough of scrapple sandwiches: a couple of slabs of scrapple between two pieces of white toast slathered with butter and ketchup. haven't had it in years, but maybe the next time i go and visit the fam.

This is one of the most elegant lounges I've been to in the entire city. The set up is extraordinary and the theme is not so much speak-easy as it is decadent and sophisticated. I have enjoyed myself numerous times since it opened and will continue to do so in the hopes that it keeps it's old world charm and exclusivity.

Around Sunset Park, the pambazo has almost attained the status of urban legend. It's a sandwich said to have originated in the streets of Guadalajara, a hero-type roll first dipped in fiery red chile sauce, than heaped with cheese, onions, salad stuff, and meat or vegetable filling. Find this working class gutbomb at Xochimilco, just south of the park called Sunset Park, where the filling is cubed potatoes, making the sandwich profoundly vegetarian -- and?profoundly filling, too. 4501 Fifth Avenue, Brooklyn, 718-435-7600??

Yes! I live right across the street from Xochimilco and first tried their pambazo after reading a vague description on Chowhound. It is so, so good, but so messy that I always take it home to avoid the embarrassment of eating it in public.

The Blogroll Gazette--Restaurant Girl on The Chopping Block & The Phil Ward Tequila Trip Continues

This week in blogs... Eat Me Daily took a break from its break to react to Danyelle Freeman (aka Restaurant Girl's) appearance on The Chopping Block. Apparently, she showed up "wearing at first a ridiculously situation-inappropriate strapless cocktail dress, and then a ridiculously situation-inappropriate spaghetti-strap cocktail dress. (Confidential to DF: next time, bra plzkthx.)" [Eat Me Daily] Grub Street takes a look at Mayahuel's bar menu of "Oaxacan fusion" dishes. The full menu won't be available until mid-May, but botanas ("exciting sharable bites made to amuse and stimulate") are available beginning this today. [Grub Street] The obsession with Phil Ward's new tequila and mezcal venture continues on Diner's Journal with a Q&A with the drinks maker himself. ("Q: Would you consider opening a joint in Toronto? A: I'm up for opening a bar anywhere. This isn't a job its a mission... I never want to see another light beer or flavored spirit watered down with soda pop. I'd open a bar on the moon for astronauts if NASA would fund it.") [Diner's Journal] The Feedbag reveals the top 12 finalists in Artisanal's grilled cheese competition being held on Facebook. In the lead: Alex Fletcher's manchego with caramelized onions and sliced pear. [The Feedbag] The Feed reports the latest on Jacques Torres' Hershey trademark infringement debacle The chocolatier is inviting people to his shops to sample his champagne kiss and decide whether it's anything like Hershey's Kisses.

Boston-New York Cocktail Smackdown

POST:
 I first published this post last spring, in honor of the first Yankees-Red Sox game. And today the same occasion rolls around again, on a beautiful, blue-sky day. And so I thought I'd revive this post, in case you feel, as I do, that this evening deserves a nice cocktail. The first Yankees-Red Sox game of the season is about to start, and in my house that calls for a drink. I won't say which team I'm rooting for because I'd rather not get the hate mail, so let's focus on the cocktails, shall we? Up first! The Bloody Sock. A Bostonian spin on a bloody mary, with a little bit of Clamato in honor of MA's great seafood, and garnished with a green bean, for beantown. It's liquored up with aquavit instead of vodka. Up second! The Drunken Egg Cream. The New York classic made with old-fashioned Fox's U-bet chocolate sauce (made in Brooklyn) and spiked with spiced rum and Kahlua. These two drinks don't go very well together, so you've got to pick sides. Recipes, after the jump. The Bloody Sock Yield: 1 drink 3 ounces aquavit 3/4 cup tomato juice 1/4 cup Clamato 1 tablespoon horseradish 4 shakes hot sauce, or to taste dash celery salt 2 shakes Worcestershire sauce 1 teaspoon fresh lime juice pickled green bean, for garnish Fill a cocktail shaker with ice, and combine all ingredients in it. Shake well. Put a couple ice cubes in a glass, and strain the Bloody Sock into the glass over the ice. Drunken Egg Cream Yield: 1 drink chocolate syrup, preferably Fox's U-bet brand 1/2 cup whole milk 1 1/2 ounces spiced rum 1 ounce Kahlua seltzer Pour about 1/4-inch of syrup into the bottom of a glass. Pour in the milk, rum and Kahlua, and stir well to dissolve the syrup. Top off with seltzer, and stir again to create froth.

Balvenie Encourages You to Make Your Scotch
AUTHOR:

DATE:
2009-04-24 12:00:00
POST:
A group of 40 adults has paid $95 each to deconstruct and reconstruct The Balvenie Signature Batch this evening at Astor Center. As luck would have it, we had the chance to participate in a little preview of the event with drinks makers Shingo Gokan of Angel's Share, Albert Trummer of Apotheke and Jim Ryan, formerly of Dressler who now shills for Hendrick's gin as a brand ambassador. Gathered in the brick-walled back room at Tavern on Jane, participants took cask-strength samples of Balvenie's DoubleWood (aged in bourbon casks), Single Barrel 15-Yr (aged in oloroso sherry casks) and PortWood whiskeys and mixed them with water by hand to try to recreate the single malt blend that is Signature Batch. We think we came pretty close to the original, but it was difficult to make a bad blend with three good scotches. Or at least that's what we told ourselves as we polished off the results. If you haven't already bought tickets to tonight's sold-out event, you can always try to recreate the experiment at home, although bottles of each scotch run $60 to $130. Or you can just buy the Signature Batch already conveniently blended and bottled. Batch 2, a blend that more closely resembles what Balvenie tasted like in 1964, before Master Distiller David Stewart introduced his patented finishing technique, has just been released and retails for $52. Balvenie whiskeys are special because it's one of only a few family-owned distilleries left in Scotland. Additionally, it's the only one to grow and malt its own barley, and use its own cooper.

Revisiting the Original Grand Sichuan
AUTHOR:
Robert Sietsema
DATE:
2009-04-24 9:35:00
POST:
       ???A dozen years back, the original Grand Sichuan on Canal Street opened just across from the triumphal entrance to the Manhattan Bridge. It was first out of the gate, gainsaying the Szechuan Empires, Szechwan Gardens, and all the other pallid evocations of Sichuan cuisine that had left us yawning. Now we have Sichuan stalls in Flushing that heap on the ma la?peppercorns, sit-down spots in Bensonhurst and Bay Ridge that wow us with the cuisine's nuance and complexity, and a pair of great chains in Manhattan itself that deliver reasonably authentic versions of Sichuan. But return with us now to the original Grand Sichuan, now detached from the Grand Sichuan empire of seven restaurants here and in Jersey. The tea-smoked duck (above) remains the jewel of the menu, a not-hot smoke-up of an entire specimen that develops a copper-colored skin with a thin layer of delicious smoky fat underneath, served with hoisin sauce. I sat with four friends on a Saturday afternoon in the window table. While the restaurant didn't deliver the mouth-searing hotness we sometimes crave, the food was still did a fine job of balancing chile oil, dried chiles, and pickled chiles. So long neglected, it's the tart flavors that the original Grand Sichuan excels as, as witnessed by the splendid sour beans and minced pork (shown below), which contains finely sliced yard beans that are themselves pickled, a dish from the Hunan menu implanted in the larger menu (It's called the Mao Ze Dong menu, because that's the province he came from.)  The dan dan noodles (shown below) were only adequate. While the meaty and beany flavors prevailed, the dish was sadly lacking in Sichuan peppercorns. We wondered if this wasn't due to the fact that the place now caters to backpackers who ride the Fung Wah bus to Boston, which stops just up the street.  The whole fish with hot bean sauce (a towering Sichuan standard) we judged good, but not great, having recently had a spectacular version at Bamboo Garden in Bensonhurst. See both dishes below for comparison.  Grand Sichuan's whole fish with hot bean sauce  Bamboo Garden's whole fish with hot bean sauce Still, the prices at the original Grand Sichuan on Canal Street are considerably less expensive than other similarly named restaurants, amounting to a savings of 30% or more. There are many fine dishes, and the cooks enjoy a special relationship with vegetables. Though the premises are now somewhat shabby, and you won't find the range of arcane dishes seen elsewhere (kidneys, for example) the place is still one of the more interesting restaurants in Manhattan's Chinatown. 125 Canal Street, 212-625-9212? ? ?

Flash in the Pan--Kung Pao Shrimp
AUTHOR:
Sarah DiGregorio
DATE:

POST:
 Flash in the pan: bringing you simple, quick, but not dumbed-down recipes. This Kung Pao shrimp recipe is adapted from a Kung Pao chicken recipe by Fuchsia Dunlop in her book Land of Plenty: A Treasury of Authentic Sichuan Cooking. I tweaked it by subbing shrimp for chicken, and adding mild, long green chiles, for color and a touch more heat. I also tossed in a pinch more Sichuan peppercorns, because I love that numbing, tingly feeling. You should feel free to up or down the quantity of chiles and peppercorns according to your own heat preference. I know the ingredient list is long, but I promise you that this goes fast. There's little chopping involved and once you start stir-frying, the dish is ready in five minutes. And if you don't have something, just do it without--I didn't have scallions around, so I used an onion--not ideal, but still good. In fact, this was one of my favorite quick dinners in a long time. Kung Pao Shrimp Yield: serves 2-3 Adapted from Fuchsia Dunlop's recipe for Kung Pao Chicken in Land of Plenty 1 pound shrimp, cleaned and shelled For the marinade: 1/2 teaspoon salt 2 teaspoons light soy sauce 1 teaspoon Shaoxing rice wine or medium-dry sherry 1 1/2 teaspoons potato flour or 2 1.4 teaspoons cornstarch 1 tablespoon water For the sauce: 3 teaspoons sugar 3/4 teaspoon potato flour, of 1 1/8 teaspoons cornstarch 1 teaspoon dark soy sauce 1 teaspoon light soy sauce 3 teaspoons chinkiang or black Chinese vinegar 1 teaspoon sesame oil 1 tablespoon chicken stock or water For the stir fry: 2 tablespoons peanut or canola oil 10-12 dried red chiles, such as arbol chiles, broken in half 1 teaspoon Sichuan peppercorns 4 garlic cloves, sliced 1 tablespoon sliced ginger 5 scallions, sliced, white parts only 2 mild long green chiles, sliced 2/3 cup roasted unsalted peanuts In a small bowl, combine the shrimp with the marinade ingredients, and mix well. Set aside. In a small bowl, combine the sauce ingredients, and whisk well. Set aside. In a wok or large frying pan over high heat, warm the oil until it shimmers. Add the chiles and the Sichuan peppercorns, and stir-fry briefly until they are crisp and the oil is spicy and fragrant. Take care not to burn the spices. (You can remove the wok from the heat for a moment if necessary to prevent overheating.) Quickly add the shrimp with the marinade, and stir-fry over high heat, stirring constantly. As soon as the shrimp have separated from each other and started to curl, add the garlic, ginger, scallions and green chiles. Stir-fry for a few minutes, until the mixture is fragrant and the shrimp are cooked through. Give the sauce a stir, and add it to the wok, continuing to stir and toss. As soon as the sauce has become thick and shiny, add the peanuts, stir them in, and serve.

If you've ever made sushi at home, then you know that, after the exhaustive process of making the rice and painstakingly prepping all the fish and veggies, hand rolling it is the most fun part of the whole operation. We're not quite sure if this German-designed maki rolling machine would improve the experience or detract from it, but it sure looks like a cool and superfluous addition any kitchen. The design studio Osko + Deichmann will showcase it at the Kitchen Ecology Exhibition in Los Angeles this June. [Crave]

The Secret's Out--Sherry Society Coming to a Back Room Near You
AUTHOR:
Chantal Martineau
DATE:
2009-04-23 15:00:00
POST:
You're induction into the secret society will go something like this: You'll receive an invitation telling you where and when to convene. You'll arrive, be greeted with a cocktail, and led down a flight of stairs or perhaps a darkened hallway to a secret room where others share your enthusiasm. We attended the inaugural meeting of the Secret Sherry Society last night, held in the wine cellar at WD-50. The cocktail was a delightfully balanced concoction of Manzanilla, Plymouth gin, sweet and dry vermouth, and a dash of orange bitters. And the meeting, attended by Gourmet, Food & Wine and Tasting Table among other food media, consisted of a pairing of Wylie Dufresne's chemically devised dishes with sherries that ran the gamut from tart and dry fino to syrupy molasses PXs. "In the US, you have to tell people that sherry can be dry," Cesar Saldana of the Consejo Regulador of Jerez told us. "In Spain, you have to convince people it can be sweet." The Secret Sherry Society is actually not a secret society at all but an effort to educate the American drinking public on how to enjoy sherry (with food, silly!). It will host tastings, as well as offer cocktail recipes and pairing ideas. And in case Wylie's dad isn't around to remind you that what you're knocking back is 15% alcohol fortified wine (as he was last night), we recommend that you make a habit of drinking lots of water upon your induction.

Korean Tacos at Seoul Station
AUTHOR:
Sarah DiGregorio
DATE:
2009-04-23 14:08:00
POST:
 Earlier today, Eater reported that Seoul Station has started selling Korean tacos, along similar lines as the ones sold at the cultish Kogi trucks in LA. Kogi is supposedly opening a truck or stand in New York at some point, but I thought I'd run over to Seoul Station to see what was what. (Meanwhile, the owner of the Kogi trucks wrote to Eater, responding to some commenters who implied the Seoul Station versions are a rip-off, saying in part, "Dude, there are more than enough Korean tacos to go around. I mean, why hate, when we can aLL appreciate?" Dude, indeed, indeed.) The notion of Korean tacos isn't so far-fetched--if bulgogi is good wrapped in lettuce with chile paste, it's probably good on a tortilla with salsa and/or other spicy condiments. It's a pretty logical fusion food. The tacos (above) at Seoul Station are $2.50 each and come with beef or pork bulgogi. That's pork to the left and beef to to the right. Each was garnished with lots of diced white onion and cilantro, and a fairly bland salsa. The pork is definitely the better of the two--the brick orange marinade is spicy, garlicky and just a little bit sweet. In the nicely griddled tortilla, it was delicious. The beef just tasted sweet--I realize that beef bulgogi is usually marinated in a milder mix, including sweet Asian pear, but this one was one-dimensional, and the beef was weirdly raggedy. Still, not bad. A fun addition to the neighborhood. 81 St. Mark's Place 212-979-9300

The Food Section Takes Cease-and-Desist with a Grain of Salt
AUTHOR:

POST:
Josh Friedland of The Food Section was "perplexed" and "annoyed" at the New York Times' letter he received demanding that he stop using the slogan "All the News That's Fit to Eat," a play on the Times' tagline. As he points out, he isn't the only who has ever riffed on the famous tag line. (Witness the books All the News That's Fit to Sell, All the Math That's Fit to Print, and the song All the News That's Fit to Sing). But the blogger admits, "That the Times would take this little one-man operation so seriously that it would marshal its legal department against my alleged 'dilution' of its brand tells me that the New York Times is paying attention to The Food Section, and that's a good thing. In a backhanded way, it's really very flattering." We think it's a shame that the Times would get their panties in a twist about an obvious parody under the guise of trademark infringement. Food Section commenters seem to agree: "blech on you, new york times." "are they saying Your parody is Their intellectual property? sheesh. I'm no laywer but have a feeling you would NOT lose this 'case' if it ever actually went anywhere." "Maybe the Times might prefer things if you changed your slogan to 'All the Food That's Fit to Charge Too Much For.'" So, Josh, what will be your tagline now?

What the Times doesn't tell you, is that the original slogan (I'm not kidding!) was: "All the news that's fit to print, won't rub off on the table cloth." Hard to "dilute" a brand like that!

I may be misquoting slightly. In Eric Burns' All the News Not Fit to Print he alludes to it: "Earlier in the century, in fact in its first decade, the Times had developed a new kind of ink to use for its paper, one that did not so easily rub off on the reader's hands, as most newspaper ink did at the time. As a result, it came up with a new slogan. The New York Times was now the newspaper that would not soil your breakfast linen." page 177, bottom Here's the Google books link: http://books.google.com/books?id=5IUgryzpXQ0C&pg=PA177&lpg=PA177&ots=GzLEjbRriD&dq=ink+%22rub+off%22+newspaper+slogan&ie=ISO-8859-1&output=html Love your blog, Barry.

Crack For Cows in Kansas
AUTHOR:
Sarah DiGregorio
DATE:
2009-04-23 9:56:00
POST:
The artificial growth hormone rBST is sometimes referred to as "crack for cows" because it kicks the bovines into overdrive, making them produce 10-25% more milk than they would otherwise--leading to more profit per cow. Aside from any animal welfare implications (reportedly, cows injected with the hormone are more likely to get udder infections), there are differences between milk produced by cows injected with rBST and cows that are not injected, and some of those differences, like an increase in an insulin-like hormone in rBST-produced milk, might have an effect on our health. But the Kansas State Legislature recently passed a bill that would place this label on milk that's not produced by cows treated with rBST: The FDA has determined that no significant difference has been shown between milk derived from rBST-supplemented and non-rBST-supplemented cows. Obviously, the label is meant to discourage consumers from buying non-rBST-supplemented milk. After all, the milk produced with rBST is cheaper, so why not buy it if there's no difference? The idea that there is no difference between the two is based on an 18-year-old study by the FDA, but studies in the intervening years have shown that there are differences in the milk's make-up, but it's still unclear whether or not those differences are harmful to humans. Obviously, Eli Lilly, which owns rBST would prefer that we not look into it too closely. Kansas Governor Kathleen Sebelius must veto the bill by end of the day today, or the bill will pass into law. Groups representing consumers, farmers and organic purveyors have petitioned the governor to act. [Gourmet]

POST:
 mmmmmm, liver pudding! (click to lengthen) Looking perhaps a little too much like a pair of disembodied legs left behind by a serial killer, liver pudding is a specialty of the Deep South that can come in the form of a sausage or a cake. It contains liver, cornmeal, and, often, pig face parts, and is flavored with sage and red pepper. Of the product, one manufacturer exclaims: "...a favorite of kids, who love it on a sandwich or warmed in the pan for breakfast. By the way, it doesn't taste like pudding and it doesn't look like liver." Though fully cooked, it needs to be reheated before eating. Find it at Carolina?Country Store, 2001 Atlantic Avenue, Brooklyn, 718-498-8033?

Vegetarian (and Vegan!) Delights of NYC--Ackee Patty
AUTHOR:
Robert Sietsema
DATE:
2009-04-23 12:05:00
POST:
 Ackee (Melicoccus bijugatus) is an evergreen native to West Africa. The three-seeded fruit of this tree, also known as ackee, came on the slave ships to Jamaica in the late 18th century. The fruit must be boiled before eating to destroy a toxin present in the yellow flesh, which is particularly enjoyed in Jamaica. When cooked, the fruit resembles scrambled eggs and has a mild taste that serves as a perfect foil for other flavors. Ackee could serve as a perfect substitute for scrambled eggs in various vegan recipes. At Jamaican Pride Bakery in Brooklyn, the foremost baker of Jamaican patties in the borough, an ackee patty is available, wherein the filling has been flavored with herbs and scotch bonnet peppers, imparting a pleasant burn. 731 Flatbush Avenue, Brooklyn, 718-462-9751 Ackee patty from Jamaican Pride Bakery Close up of the ackee filling, showing its resemblance to scrambled eggs. Actually, it also looks an awful lot like George Washington. Click here to see other Vegetarian Delights of NYC

Chong Qing Chicken Obsession, Part Two
AUTHOR:
Sarah DiGregorio
DATE:
2009-04-22 14:19:00
POST:
 In my last dispatch from Chong Qing chicken obsession, I told you about eating the dish--composed mainly of chiles, augmented with some fried chicken--at Grand Sichuan House in Bay Ridge and Grand Sichuan St. Marks, in the East Village. The dish is named after its native home, Chong Qing, a city in Sichuan province that Fuschia Dunlop describes in Shark Fin and Sichuan Pepper as having a "filthy magnificence." I don't know about filthy, but Chong Qing chicken is magnificent. It involves dried red chiles, sliced fresh green chiles and a great quantity of mouth-numbing Sichuan peppercorns, fried in oil with garlic and tossed with bite-sized nubbins of fried chicken. So today I came across Metro Cafe, a month-old restaurant on 8th Avenue in Sunset Park's Chinatown--and it's the first proper Sichuan restaurant I know of in the neighborhood. I'm planning on doing a full review, so I don't want to scoop myself here, but this restaurant is a weird and wonderful place, combining traditional Sichuan dishes with an assortment of Japanese snacks and Beijing-style grilled skewers. But today we're just here to obsess over the Chong Qing chicken, which I present to you above, in its cardboard container, its marvelousness undiluted by taking it to go. It was delicious. Metro Cafe 4924 Eighth Avenue, Brooklyn 718-437-7980

I know Eater declared banh mi "over," but in my opinion, the banh mi fad is that rare thing: a trend that actually results in an increase in delicious, affordable food. This week, my column reviews Bep and Nha Toi, two new Vietnamese spots in Williamsburg. Bep serves pho, bun and other simple dishes in addition to it banh mi, and Nha Toi concentrates more on the sandwiches, adding an assortment of summer rolls on the side. Here are some pictures of Nha Toi's offerings. The classic cold cut-pate banh mi: That's headcheese and pork roll, and check out the little bird's eye chile--instead of sriracha or sliced jalapenos, Nha Toi just gives you one of those suckers to nibble on. More photos after the jump. Banh mi with seared basa fish. Banh mi with braised beef Pho banh mi: stuffed with the makings of pho like fatty brisket, sprouts, basil and hoisin sauce. Banh mi with gelatinous shreds of pork skin, roast pork and roasted rice powder. Summer rolls. From left: shrimp/bacon, Chinese sausage, shredded pork skin/pork/rice powder.

The Strange Case of the Disappearing B.Y.O.B.
AUTHOR:
Robert Sietsema
DATE:
2009-04-21 22:51:00
POST:
I'm very fond of places that allow you to bring your own bottle of wine, and don't charge a corkage fee. Some of these places are doing it because they really want to let you bring your own wine, but more do it because they don't have their liquor license yet. B.Y.O.B. allows you to drink wine a thousand times better than the overpriced swill you usually get on a wine list at the bottom end, where markups can run as high as 300%. Several of my favorite new places are B.Y.O.B., at least they were. In the last two weeks, three joints I'm frequenting have unexpectedly altered that policy, leaving me standing with a perfectly good bottle of wine, unable to uncork it. At An Choi, the new Vietnamese sandwich lounge on Orchard Street, the waitress hastened up as I pulled the bottle of Grechetto out of my rucksack. "We're just about to get our liquor license and if the inspectors see that, we might not get it." When her back was turned, we managed to pour some into our water glasses, and enjoy the tart, alcoholic white with some pretty scrumptious banh mi. At El Amacen, an Argentine-Mexican place in Williamsburg, the waitress pulled the same thing. I'd successfully brought in my own wine on two previous occasions, but, seeing me carry in a wine-store bag, she sidled up as if revealing state secrets, "Several other restaurants around here have recently been busted for B.Y.O.B." "I thought it was perfectly legal," I replied. "Apparently not!" she exclaimed." She wasn't' able to tell me what the places that had been busted were. Motorino, near the Graham Avenue stop on the L, is famous for its B.Y.O.B. policy, and I recently clued Fork in the Road readers as to the perfect wine to go with its luscious pies. "They're not doing that anymore," my friend Amy noted ruefully. I brought a six pack in and they told me I couldn't drink it. Then the waiter launched into an informational lecture about the different root beers they had for sale." "Root beer and pizza," I replied, wrinkling up my nose, "I don't think so." So what gives? Read Chantal Martineau's advice about B.Y.O.B., and places that allow it. [Update: Eater reports, based on a Grub Street piece, that Motorino has just received its liquor license.]

Zagat covered this a couple years ago. I can't imagine Bloomie has loosened up the rules since then. Basically, BYOB is illegal, unless you've got a license or you've got fewer than 20 seats. http://www.zagat.com/Blog/Detail.aspx?SCID=40&BLGID=1347

And it gets a little bit more complicated... While restaurants with under 20 seats may usually allow BYO, they are restricted from doing so if they've applied for a booze license. I've read several recent articles about the state liquor authority beginning to crack down on the BYOB thing this year. They don't have the legal power to do anything but deny/revoke a license. Anonymous tipsters are however effective at getting the NYPD to write up a summons. When will New York get past the anachronistic liquor laws?

Our fellow food blog's 'Hiatus' post sounds mysterious, but the accompanying postcard pic of Florida Aqua Maids water skiing seems lighthearted so we aren't sure what to make of it. We hope EMD will be back soon--who else will we link to for items such as meat pants? A contributor to EMD told us that she didn't know what the deal was: "My contact there is just 'contact'--in fact, I don't even know if it's a man or a woman." Mysterious indeed.

What to 'B' to a New Nolita Joint Flying Liquor License-less for the Moment
AUTHOR:
Chantal Martineau

POST:
Every week or so in 'What to B When You BYOB' we ask a local wine shop to recommend a few good wines under $20 to pair with the food at a nearby BYOB restaurant. This week, we talk to Maya Pedersen and Jean-Baptiste Humbert of Wine Therapy in Nolita about what to bring to a nearby recently opened Italian restaurant that has yet to receive its liquor license and so technically isn't supposed to be touting itself as a BYOB. Italo Pietrantonj Montepulciano D'Abruzzo 2006, Italy ($14.99) This smooth and fresh medium-bodied red is casual and easy going, says Jean-Baptiste. It drinks well with crudo, salami, cheeses and other finger foods. Salike Vermentino di Sardegna DOC 2007, Italy ($16.99) "The Salike is delicious," says Maya. "It's full of honey and melon, but it's still dry. And a little weighty." She suggests pairing it with polenta. Feudo Montoni G Grillo 2007, Sicilia, Italy ($15.99) "This one is mineral and dry, but also fresh and almost briny," according to Maya, who adds that it will complement oily anchovies without overpowering delicate things like squash blossoms. Odoardi Savuto 2004, Calabria, Italy ($18.99) "I've actually never heard of any of these crazy Calabrian grapes," says Maya, a certified sommelier, of Gaglioppo, Greco Nero and Nerello Capuccio, which make up this red blend. "It's a bigger, fuller wine. It's smoky and wild. It'll go great with the roasted lamb."

Strange Snacks of the World--Freakish Sapor

POST:
Peanuts with a crunchy coating aren't so unusual, but this "natural foodstuff" advertises itself in a highly creative way: Freakish Sapor! I love that word, freakish. Anyway, it turns out that the world 'sapor' comes from the Latin sapere, to taste, and 'sapor' was used in Middle English to mean 'taste.' You can imagine that the marketing manager for this snack, at his or her computer in GuangZhou, was using some very tempermental translation software. Maybe they wanted to write something like 'unusual taste,' or 'special taste,' and instead they got freakish sapor. In any case, these peanuts, bought at No. 2 Dynasty Market on 18th Avenue in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, are not really special or even freakish. I thought they'd taste of wasabi or seaweed, but they really don't taste like anything at all.

POST:
 The imperially long Philadelphia steak sandwich as rendered by Philly's (click to elongate) Pride of the?City of Brotherly Love, the Philly cheesesteak sandwich was supposedly invented by Pat Olivieri and his brother Harry in 1930, when they had a hot dog cart?in the Italian Market area of South Philadelphia. They?took a?long hero roll (a demi-baguette, really--there had been a craze for French bread all over the United States in the 1920s), heaped it with thin-sliced beef, lavished it with sauteed green peppers and onions, and laid on slices of Provolone cheese. The brothers founded Pat's King of Steaks soon thereafter, still one of the most famous (maybe not the best) purveyors of cheesesteaks. New Yorkers recognize Brooklyn's own Italian roast beef hero as one of the progenitors of the trashier Philadelphia version of the sandwich, but--let's face it--the cheesesteak?is a wonderful thing unto itself, and we've had several credible versions here for the last eight years. Newcomer Philly's on Houston makes a superb rendition, and you can get fresh jalapenos instead of the usual green bell peppers, which makes it a kind of Mexi-Philly cheesesteak. 191 East Houston Street, 212-475-7744

The Early Word--Baoguette Cafe

POST:
 I went over to the old Bamn! spot on St. Mark's to check out Baoguette Cafe, the new sister restaurant to Curry Hill's banh mi place, Baoguette. The place is cute--large color photographs of Vietnam on the walls, garlands of ginger and chiles hanging from the ceiling, two communal blond wood tables and a bar facing the open kitchen. The menu offers the banh mi that are served at Baoguette, and adds a selection of pho and bun (rice noodle bowls). Chef Michael "Bao" Huynh was in the kitchen himself. Some of the most interesting stuff is on the appetizer section--Vietnamese crepes with pork belly and shrimp, house-made lemongrass sausage, grilled corn on the cob dusted with dried shrimp--but those are only available at night. The only appetizer that's made for lunch service is the green papaya salad ($6, pictured above) which was fine. It could have used more spice (and I asked for extra spicy) and depth of flavor. I did appreciate that it was scattered with a very generous number of perfectly cooked shrimp.  And this is the bun with grilled pork chop and shrimp ($9). I often get this at Pho Tu Do and Pho Grand, and Baoguette's version is just as good. The noodles, in particular, showed that care had been taken--they were supple, and not overcooked, as is sometimes the case. Sadly, the soft serve was sold out, so I'll have to go back for that pandan soft serve. 37 St. Mark's Place 212-380-1487

They show up to the parking lot the day of the big game with food, a grill, a table, chairs, plates, cups, condiments and cooking utensils... and you get to kick back and tailgate your little heart out until the coin flip.

The Brunch Report--Toad in a Hole at 5 Ninth

In these tough economic times, Sunday brunch can be the only splurge on a meal out in a place with real cloth napkins one can afford. So, we've decided to start bringing you The Brunch Report, a dispatch from the front lines of New York's most hallowed Sunday tradition. This week, we dropped by one of the only places we can stand in the MePa for one of our favorite brunch items: Toad in a Hole. We loved this as kids--because of the name, of course--and it's still fun to order. We wish it looked more like a toad, but we've never seen one that has. 5 Ninth's was well made, with the egg housed in thick country fried bread, but accompanied only by a sad little salad, which left our adult-sized tummies not quite full. Luckily, the Bloody Mary, with its generous helping of freshly grated horseradish was the kind of drink you can chew. We've also heard of the dish being referred to as Egg in a Basket and Pharaoh's Eye, the latter of which we think sounds creepy.

I regularly make toad in the hole and this egg dish (though not at the same time). Toadie as my family calls it is as the above posters describe: Yorkshire pud with sausages. I first discovered the egg dish at summer camp many years ago where it was called "spit in the eye egg." And yes, you make a hole in the bread so that the yolk, at least, makes contact with the pan.

[NY Times] As families allocate less of their spending budgets to eating out, fast-food chains have started to feel the effects and their stocks are dropping.

I too love the name, "Oh My Chicken," pity their oversauced Korean fried chicken sucks. There's a soul food place in Albertson called something like "Hoo wee." The sign sports a yellow happy face.

Congratulations, you've made it to Friday afternoon and it's all downhill from here. Here's what we got up to this week: We got the Early Word on two new pizza joints: One from an Italian rapper-turned-pizza-maker and Anselmo's in Red Hook, which is turning out some fine, affordable coal-oven-fired pies. We inaugurated our Three-Dollar Throwdown: Chantal made a shrimp and bok choy stir-fry, Robert invented a shrimp and shroom sub and Sarah came up with a spiced bean soup and fried plantains. We explained why we really don't enjoy the Travel Channel's Bizarre Foods We delved into the world of aged sake We loved vegetarian khatsa at Himalayan Cafe, an East Village Nepalese diner We talked to Resto chef Bobby Hellen about roasting a whole hog--and found out he could hook us up with our own piggy Our Man Sietsema was very annoyed by Larry, the creepy Quaker Oat dude

Cunni-Linguine, Garlic (My Balls) Bread, and Tap That Ass-paragus Soup are just a few of the recipes you'll find at Cook to Bang, which has just nabbed a cookbook deal with St. Martins. [Grub Street] "Obviously none of us would ever want to come to Midtown over the weekend (M-F is quite enough thank you)," says Midtown Lunch, tempted by the 12 whole lambs that Estiatorio MILOS will roast for Greek Easter this weekend. [Midtown Lunch] Serious Eats has a few ideas about what to do with the bhut jolokia, which beat out red savina for the Guinness title of world's spiciest chile. The bhut jolokia scores about million units on the Scoville scale, compared to the red savina's 400,000. [Serious Eats] Twitter has another fake Restaurant Girl--or is it the first fake RG? The impostor has duped not just regular Tweeters but even Eater with its fake misspellings and reports of RG's adventures.

Flash in the Pan--Nicoise-ish Salad

POST:
Flash in the Pan: quick, easy but not-dumbed down recipes. Finally, finally it feels like spring--time to eat something refreshing and bright tasting. This dish has many of the elements of Nicoise salad, with the addition of chickpeas, so let's call it Nicoise-ish. Nicoise-ish Salad Yield: 2 servings I splurge and use Italian canned tuna for this salad. Try Flott Sicilian tuna belly, which is wonderfully rich. It is more delicious than you ever imagined canned tuna could be. It also costs $7.50 per can at Fairway, so it had better be good. 3 tablespoons lemon juice 1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil salt and pepper 2 heads romaine lettuce, chopped 1 roasted red bell pepper 1/3 pound sting beans, trimmed and blanched 1/2 red onion, sliced thin 1 (15.5-ounce) can chickpeas, drained and rinsed 2 hard boiled eggs, quartered 1/4 cup chopped flat-leaf parsley 2 (4.5 ounce) tins good-quality tuna in olive oil 2 tablespoons capers In a small bowl combine lemon juice, olive oil and generous pinches of salt and pepper, and whisk to combine. Set aside. In a large bowl, combine lettuce, red bell pepper, string beans, onion and chickpeas. Drizzle the dressing over the top, and toss to dress the salad evenly. Taste a piece of lettuce, and season with more salt and pepper if desired. Divide the dressed salad among two large serving bowls. Divide the boiled eggs and parsley equally between the two bowls. Flake the tuna from the tins on top of each salad, and garnish with capers. Pair this salad with a glass of Lillet Blanc, a fortified wine aperitif made from white wine and brandy that tastes lightly citrusy. Serve it on the rocks with a slice of orange. It all goes really well together and definitely tastes like warm weather food and drink.

Annoying Food Advertising Campaigns--Quaker Oats

 ?Is that a light-sabre scar I see on your cheek, Larry? You've seen him on taxis, in bus shelters, in the subway, and on billboards--the Quaker Oats guy in his retrograde broad-brimmed hat beaming down on you. The crass corporate appropriation of a religion is always annoying (the plain oat cereal we love has no connection with the Quaker religion), but here the Pepsicola Corporation has finally revealed that the guy is not a solemn worshipper from the past, but an alien! to find out more, take the jump The teaser ad for Quaker Oats as it appears on a taxi (click to attain escape velocity) The ad features the beaming face of the Quaker Oats guy (I always assumed he was William Penn), but with his smile even more intense in a weird sort of way, as if he'd popped too many Prozacs. His eyes are a shade of blue never seen on this planet. The slogan he telepathically communicates is "Go Humans Go." Clearly, he's an alien who's come down to earth to encourage us during economic hard times, right? The rationale behind the campaign was explicated last month in the NY Times during the roll-out,?wherein?we discover that we're?likely to be hammered with this absurdism for a long time to come. Exploring the website attached to the campaign, we discover its manifold aspects, including?harnessing the mom bloggers like trained monkeys, whose children?we can imagine tugging at their publicity hungry sleeves: "Mom, where are you going? Can't you spend some time with me?" "Shut up kid, I have to go to Times Square and shill for Quaker Oats." Saddest of all in the last link, we learn that the Quaker Oats?alien is named Larry.??

Some sectors of the food industry have resorted to hiring state employees to do inspections in an effort to fill in gaps where current regulation has failed. But safety advocates warn that conflicts of interest could arise. [NY Times] PETA is calling for the mayor of Newark to ban new fast-food joints in the city, citing a 2007 study that exposed Newark as the fattest city in New Jersey, and another study that suggests those who leave near fast-food chains are more likely to suffer a stroke. [AP via Philly] While Germans honored the new US president with deep fried chicken snacks, a French female winemaker, originally from Guinea, is touting a new Obama cuvee. Proceeds from the sale of the wine will go to a non-profit in Darfur. [Spiegel] A Finnish company is the world's first to add a water consumption label to its product packaging. A year ago, the company introduced the CO2 label on food products. [AFN] Two record executives, who took Jay-Z and his entourage out for drinks at M2 in Chelsea, have been accused of stiffing the club on a $1,500 check. The Jigga himself dropped a $500 tip, but left before the bill was settled. [NY Post]

The Early Word--Anselmo's Coal Oven Pizza in Red Hook
AUTHOR:
Sarah DiGregorio
DATE:
2009-04-16 16:19:00
POST:
A nice looking pie, yes? What's even nicer is that this 10-incher is only $6. Red Hook's Anselmo's Coal Oven Pizzeria officially opened last Friday, and being on the pizza beat this week, I stopped by today to check it out. New coal-burning ovens are not allowed in New York for environmental reasons, but coal ovens that existed before the regulations took effect are grandfathered in. Anselmo's website says that the owners of the building were originally going to turn the place into a bakery, but when they discovered that they were in possession of a coal oven, they decided to renovate the place into a pizza joint. A coal fire burns at 1000 degrees or more, imparting char and a smoky flavor that can make wonderful pizza. Pizza maker Anselmo Garcia has worked at several bakeries and restaurants in the tri-state area; this afternoon, he was at his post at the brick oven, stretching dough, monitoring pies as they cooked, and chatting with customers. A pile of white-hot, ashed-over coals was visible through the door to the oven. There are two main options on the menu: Niapolitania pizza [sic] or pizza bianco. The former is shown above: a simple margherita-style pizza composed of tomato sauce, fresh mozzerella and basil. The pizza bianco is simply dressed with olive oil and salt. Either kind of pizza can be had as is (10-inch $6, 14-inch $14) or with added toppings like basil pesto, roasted peppers, wild mushrooms, onions, pepperoni, and so on ($1.75 each). I thought the tomato sauce was fantastic: vibrant and fresh-tasting, but also with an umami-like depth that some sauces lack. It's also nice that the basil was cut into a chiffonade, so that it could be distributed more equally around the pie. The crust had a nice dapple of char, and was crisp-sturdy--no tip dip in evidence (tip dip doesn't bother me, but some people don't like it). My only complaint is that the crust was a bit dense: no puff or bubbles anywhere, making it a little tough. Still, a very tasty pizza, at a very fair price. And these are early days--surely Anselmo will only get better at wrangling his dough and his oven. Anselmo's Pizzeria 354 Van Brunt Street, Brooklyn 718-313-0169 Daily: 11am-11pm Cash only/BYOB

Ever wanted to cook a whole hog? Well, it ain't that hard, says Resto's young chef, Bobby Hellen. He recently took us to the backyard to show us how it's done. What's the key to roasting a whole pig? Time. It's all about time. You have to brine [the pig] for 24 hours. I actually didn't have a container big enough for this guy so I got a huge garbage pail and spent a little time on his head, then a little time on his ass. It looked like a pig in a jacuzzi in my walk-in. After that, it's maybe another 24 hours of hanging it to dry out so that when you put it in to roast, it gets crispy quicker. And then, it's all about the roasting. This pig (an 80 pounder) will take about six hours. How would someone do this at home? The kit that I have now is really inexpensive, less than a barbecue. It's the Caja China, which is like a box that Chinese Cubans have used for generations to roast whole pigs. You can buy it online. And how does one get a whole pig? Hmm... I'm not sure. I guess if you have a butcher--not a lot of people have butchers anymore--go to your butcher. Or, go to a restaurant that you know that deals with good product. Like, I could definitely hook somebody up with a pig. Be careful... you might end up with a thousand pig requests next week. So, what do you do with the pig once it's done cooking? I'm gonna take it out and let it rest a little while, let all the juices come together. Then, I'll start breaking it down, debone all of it, try to see how many portions I'm gonna get, probably 50 or 60. I'll separate it into legs, loins and ribs, arms and head, and try to give a bit of each to everyone. It's gonna be a total mess. There's gonna be juice everywhere. It's gonna be fun. Why do you think the idea of cooking a whole animal appeals to Joe BBQ at home? I think people want to return to simple things. If I wasn't cooking with the Caja China, I'd be taking the head off, using the legs for sausage, the loins to roast, the saddle to make a roulade or porchetta. It's the oldest way of cooking, really. But a lot of people have forgotten how to get a whole animal, break it down and actually make something out of it. You know, butchering is one of the prettiest things to watch. Resto roasted a whole hog recently for its second anniversary, but you can call ahead to order the Large Format Feast anytime. Just pick your animal and bring your friends.

Sake To Me--We Sample Aged Rice Wine
AUTHOR:

DATE:
2009-04-16 11:47:00
POST:
First, like the rubes that we are, we drank hot sake. Then, we discovered that heating it was all just a ruse to mask cheap wine. So, we started ordering it cold. Eventually, we learned the differences between junmai-shu and ginjo-shu and experimented with milky unfiltered stuff in dark sake dens like Decibel. And recently, we discovered aged sake, a strange and largely unregulated substance that is barely recognizable from its young counterpart. Akin to sherry, aged sake has an oxidized essence and ranges in color from a pale amontillado-like shade of hay to a deeper brown, like oloroso. We sampled a few different ones at Zenkichi, the labyrinthine Japanese brasserie in Williamsburg. The first, a Himezen Ichinokura Junmai, was clear and rather simply sweet. The second, a Hanahato Kijoshu aged 8 years, was more complex--amber in color and redolent of nuts, vanilla and bitter chocolate. The third, a hay-colored Katsuyama Genroku, was all dried fruit and spice, and was the most balanced, pairing best with the sweet homemade mochi we ordered. Zenkichi, which is currently celebrating cherry blossom season with a traditional omakase menu featuring the aromatic, tart flowers, has plans to open a Manhattan location next year. Kanpai to that.

I was assistant manager at a sake bar for 4 years;some sakes retain their characteristics very well upon being heated, e.g. dry or med-dry ones like tengumai. Of course there are certain types of sake that should ONLY be drunk chilled (especially some amakuchi junmaishu, nigori-zake etc) But just because a restaurant has one or two types of cold sake doesn't mean those are quality sakes. And heating is not necessarily a sin.

"Michael" and "Kristy" from the grossout YouTube video in which two Domino's Pizza employees defile pizza toppings before allegedly serving them to customers face felony charges and, possibly, a civil suit. [FOXNews] Don't do as they say or as they do--TV chefs are spreading their bad habits to viewers, such as the overuse of tin foil (Giada), overconsumption of mass-produced meat (Guy Fieri), and purchase of over-packaged pre-made foods (Sandra Lee). [Huffington Post] Fruits and vegetables are good for you--if you're a non-smoker. Smokers, on the other hand, may increase their risk of colon cancer by eating too many fruits and vegetables, according to a recent Europe-wide study. [AFP via Google] Meanwhile, a British study has found that children who eat foods rich in vitamins A and C, such as broccoli, spinach and squash, are less likely to develop asthma. [Independent] Frank Bruni appealed to readers yesterday to save their favorite two- and three-star restaurants from a failing economy: "If there's a restaurant out there that you love, visit it... Because if you don't do that--and maybe even if you do--there's a solid chance they won't be around on the far side of these dark days." [NY Times]

Big Pork Blacklash--Times Op-Ed Writer Defends His Position On Small Farm Pigs
AUTHOR:
Chantal Martineau
DATE:
2009-04-15 13:46:00
POST:
Photo by jere_me @ FlickrThe New York Times may have appended its recent op-ed piece on how small farm pork may be more prone to contamination than its industrially raised counterpart, but readers haven't quite yet recovered from the episode. And neither has the op-ed's author. James McWilliams cited a study in the article that, as it turns out, was funded by the National Pork Board, and has since "endured a wallop of criticism," he says in an Atlantic Food Channel piece defending his position. "The condemnation scans the spectrum of civility," he adds. "A butcher in Iowa has offered to remove my testicles." His response to the issue of the study's funding? "It's very difficult for scientists to undertake large studies without industry funding." But he does concede that he may have erred in his claim that the pigs in the study tested positive for trichinella, salmonella, and toxoplasma. They actually tested seropositive: "I know full well the difference between testing positive for a pathogen and testing positive for the antibodies of that pathogen. You can test positive for the antibodies of a disease and still not have it. It's very unlikely, but possible." And, no, he's not in on some seedy Big Pork propaganda ploy. He's a vegetarian. Still, we'll probably keep taking our chances on locally and sustainably raised pigs.

It amazes me that corporate farming supporters quote the potential harm of a couple of pigs tested and found to be at question. But hey don't look at the actual harm from the runoff and pollution caused by the industrial pig farms that we know about. Corporate farming of pigs has been linked to health problems, the pollution and poor health of the Chesapeake and other waterways, respiratory problems for the neighbors of the feedlot etc. Secondly corporate farming is intimately related to corporate food processing. When we get our hot dogs and hamburgers made in 20,000 batches, any contamination problem rises to the status of major health hazard, not a localized outbreak. Finally is the health effects of the meat itself. Does the industrialized meat chain lead to more heart disease? This is a study you won't see financed by the big ag folk. But large scale health data seem to show that industrial foods in and of themselves are unhealthy. Certainly the insane use of antibiotics we see has had a devastating health cost on our population. The costs of big ag and industrial farming is health problems that cost thousand and thousands of lives each year. And he is worried about some small scale pork that is potentially dangerous? YIKES! I'll take my chances!!!

You said it, brother. At least when problems arise with foods from small farms, the issues are traceable and, thus, more easily contained. I'll take that "risk" over mass-produced, mass-polluting, antibiotics-ridden industrially farmed meat any day.

Tequila Time--The Rumors Are Swirling About Phil Ward's New Tequila Den

POST:
Photo borrowed from A Muddled ThoughtWord at the bar has been that Phil Ward of Death & Co. fame has plans to open his own cocktail lounge with a focus on tequila and mezcal. A Muddled Thought spotted some work being done at 304 E 6th Street, a few doors down from Death & Co., where a sign proclaims the place as Mayahuel. We noticed this in drink writers Gary & Mardee Haidin Regan's newsletter: "New Cocktail Lounge in Manhattan seeks bartenders... with strong focus on Tequila and Mezcal... Seeking 'career oriented' candidates who consider the creation of cocktails a profession bordering on art and not merely a means to an end. (Paying Bills) If precision down to the dash seems absurd to you please do not respond. If you think you are the right candidate for this position email me at Phil@deathandcompany.com." AMT says: "If the name, Mayahuel is any indication, once this place opens cocktail enthusiasts will not be disappointed. Mayahuel in Spanish is the female god most commonly associated with the maguey plant. Maguey is also the type edible caterpillar (yes you read that right) that frequently infests maguey and Agave plants, which are the basis for most forms of tequila and mezcal." OK, now we're excited.

Bizarre Foods with Andrew Zimmern airs on the Travel Channel. I hate it. Here's why. 1. Zimmern chews with his mouth open. 2. Zimmern insists on dressing in brightly hued shorts and polo shirts, clothes that scream "stereotypical American tourist!" so loudly that not even real, live, stereotypical American tourists would wear them. 3. Zimmern condescendingly explains the food to the very people who just made it for him: "You know this is sweet, and...it's chewy. It's got an undertone of citrus." 4. Zimmern mugs shamelessly at the camera, usually while some sainted grandma is cooking her specialty just for him, as if we're all in on this big joke. The joke being: Wow, these strange people eat really disgusting things, don't they?! Can you believe they eat this stuff? I could really go for a cheeseburger right now. You know, normal food! 5. On a recent episode in Japan, Zimmern visits a funazushi (fermented raw fish) maker, a guy whose family has been making funazushi for 18 generations. As this fellow is proudly showing Zimmern around the centuries-old operation, he opens a barrel filled with fermented fish. Zimmern makes a disgusted face, and says something about how revolting it is. His Japanese host looks embarrassed. 6. Zimmern often visits poor countries, where people don't always have enough to eat. He visits people in their homes, eats their hard-won, homemade food, and explains to them that their food is bizarre, all the while making faces to indicate just how grossed out he is. It really makes you appreciate Anthony Bourdain, who, in similar situations, is unfailingly polite. 7. Didn't your mother ever teach you that it's rude to say that someone's food is disgusting or weird?

Wow! Harsh... first off, the guy was a former alcoholic and heroin addict, wasn't he? Can't really blame him for not drinking. I have seen an occasional episode where he finds something gross in a very very poor village, and clearly this kind of travel show isn't the best vehicle for stuff like that... but I've always found that AZ is usually really respectful of all the places he visits (terrible clothing not withstanding). And I give his show a lot of credit for teaching me how to eat and appreciate all sorts of food and flavors that years ago I wouldn't have touched. I think the only reason to hate Andrew Zimmern is because we're jealous that we don't have his job!

A clarification: it's not that I think it's wrong to find certain foods gross. I recently tried dried worms for the first time, and I did not like them at all. But if someone made them for me, I'd eat them and say thank you, and never let on that I didn't like them.

Having only seen a handful of episodes with Andrew Zimmern, I have to say that I like his show. It's a fun watch whenever it comes across the tube. Comparing him with Bourdain is unfair because if they both go to China, only one of them for sure will eat Peking duck and soup buns. I remember the episode where he went to Taiwan. I'm sorry, but even in Taiwan, there's plenty of shit that Taiwanese people will say, "Damn, that looks nasty." It's true. And AZ was also in Taipei 101 eat the same tasty things like other people and loving it. AZ at the very least will try the food. And the show is about bizarre foods. I know people who don't ever put mushrooms or onions in their mouths. So I have to give props to this guy.

Huh, I've always thought that Andrew Zimmern would be the perfect dinner guest because he'll try anything and seems to me to always be very genuinely gracious to his hosts, especially those who invite him into their home. The show is called "Bizarre Foods" - of course there will be some mugging for the camera and exclamations about the oddity of the dishes. I actually had to come around to liking Bourdain after being hooked on Bizarre Foods - I always found Bourdain's attitude annoying but have learned to overlook it since he often has awesome encounters with great chefs.

I'm a fan of both Bourdain and AZ. Their shows are as different as the hosts. Sure they both travel, eat, and interact with the locals. But wheras Bourdain cynic personality and appreciation for good food is the appeal of his series, AZ is an overly friendly tourist that is willing to try the less than appitizing eats that Bourdain doesn't do much of. In that regard I respect AZ's sense of adventure. Wheras we watch Bourdain eat and react in foodgasm, AZ talks about the taste, texture and smell of what he's eating. Let's be honest, AZ's food hosts are as interested and excited in getting an outsider to appreciate their food as he is willing to try it. So far AZ has yet to fail me and due to his daring I'm more willing to try foods that have previously been a stretch for me. Likewise with Bourdain. I don't know what the numbers are in viewership, but I have to think that half enjoy both shows and the remaining two quarters are split on either host. They're both fun shows to watch. Quite possibly the only discerning factor for me is that I'd be more interested in the writing of Bourdain (which is excellant), compared to AZ (that I'm not aware of, or interested in).

Andrew Zimmerman is a prime example of a stupid American tourist mocking and insulting outside cultures Who the hell made this moron ambassador of "normal" food. The difference between Bourdain and Zimmerman, is that Bourdain just eats it. He doesn't make a fuss about the weirdness factor and always, always shows respect and appreciation towards his guests. Zimmerman insults his guests.

Isn't Bizarre Foods pretty much the same show as No Reservations? I mean, both Zimmern and Bourdain seem to visit the same places and eat (almost) the same food. Zimmern invariably eats it and grimaces. Bourdain says "I won't eat that shit." But really, it's the same show. Why now just merge the shows and have Zimmern join Bourdain as his sidekick.

The main thing I like about Zimmern is his constant honesty. He is candid about every reaction and experience and that is refreshing compared to the over-narrated, postured, tough-guy-with-a-heart-of-gold bs you see on Bourdain. 1. Okay. 2. I'd rather he dress in the bright touristy shit than pretend to be a part of the culture. He's there to eat food and leave, not assimilate into a culture. I don't want to see him in most traditional garb. ew. 3. He is explaining the food to US. to let us know how it tastes and feels. He's not being condescending, he's doing his job. 4. Shamelessly mugging the camera??? He is genuinely surprised and excited about the food he's getting. Again the the frank thing. 5. 18 generations!!! I'm sure someone hasn't liked their fermented fish in 18 generations of making it. I think it would be more offensive if he pretended to like it and then later on camera told us how gross it was. 6. The villages he visits are so excited to have a visitor from anywhere. I think they are honored to be visited and on camera. I don't think they expect him to like everything. He ALWAYS eats a good amount of it and they are more entertained by his dislike than they are offended. 7. I'm sure if you tried some of the shit he tried you would spit it out and run away. He' on a TV show and we expect the truth from him. If you want bullshit, watch Bourdain.

Absolutely agreed that we shouldn't blame him for not drinking! In fact, good for him for being in recovery. But I have just seen too many episodes in which he is invited to someone's home or place of business, and proceeds to tell the people there that their food smells terrible. It makes me crazy because they're preparing for him the foods they eat everyday, the foods they are proud to serve a guest, and it seems like he's just using it as a childish gross-out opportunity. But I'm glad if he has taught you to try things you wouldn't have! And I don't hate they guy himself (don't know him!)--just his show.

I wouldn't worry about the people who make the worms that Zimmern does his ritualized "yucks!" over. All these shows are arranged by publicists working for the respective countries and all the arrangements are made by them and the travel and food is comped. This is all fake anthropology, and the poor suckers making the worms are recruited to field the "yucks!" and probably know about them in advance. On food TV, you don't expect anything to be real, just like you don't expect a dunderhead like Zimmern to do any of the research or legwork necessary to produce a legitimate show about actual ethnic food.

So, it's one thing to chew with your mouth open like a dopey ox , which I would also put at the top of my dislikes about this show, but it's another keep the level of the chewing high in post production. WTF?!? His jaw pops too. I'd also add that, unlike Bourdain's "No Reservations," Zimmerman has no overriding point of view informing his explorations and experiences. The show's simplistic philosophy is fully conveyed by the juvenile title. Perhaps worst of all, Zimmerman doesn't seem to have any knowledge or respect for other cultures' notions of affection or personal space. Every episode features him doltishly embracing and kissing men and women who seem to be trying to squirm away from his embraces. Not everyone is his #$%$ing grandmother.

It really irks me that, unfailingly, every time he eats a meal with his hands, he takes a bite and *flicks* the remaining food off his hands in the general direction of the plate he took the food from, spreading the Zimmern-virus all over the poor third world country's citizens.

c'mon. bourdain eats as much "bizarre" food as that moron az. the difference is, as people have pointed out, bourdain honors his hosts and their sacrifice. just think of the episode in africa when he ate the ass end of a warthog. he may have been snarky (and justifiably so) away from his hosts, but in front of them he was gracious and humble and respectful of their sacrifice. can't imagine what that moron zimmern's reaction would be in that situation. ab deserves the meals at el bulli to even out. (as an aside, the noises of zimmern chewing [open-mouthed] is disgusting, and have annoyed since show 1).

If you don't like the show, change the channel to something else - you can still do that in this country (at least at this point in time you still can). I'm sure there's a rerun of Emeril Live, Paula's Party or Guy's Big Bite playing on the Food Network that you can watch :)

Anthony Bourdain is who I want to BE, but I think I'd rather have AZ for a friend. He will clearly try anything. I find him to be largely respectful to the people and the tradition of the food, but honest in his reactions. Besides, I once saw an episode of Bizaar Foods in NYC in which Tony B admitted he had never been to Brooklyn - how long has the guy lived in NY? Maybe that's the difference - Brooklyn vs Manhattan.

Great food is not hard to come by in New York. Genuinely surprising food that still manages to taste good is more difficult, and that's why Desnuda feels like such a find. Check out this week's review of the restaurant--eating there was the most fun I've had at a restaurant in a long time. I love the total lack of pretension, the bad jokes made by the co-owner and the way the chef putters around and comes up with a ceviche he just invented that second, one that is likely to be delicious. It's just a great little spot. A friend suggested that it would be a good date restaurant, because the improvisatory nature of a meal there gives you lots to talk about. Get the bong-smoked oysters and find out if your date has a sense of humor. Desnuda 122 East 7th Street 212-254-3515

We all know that kids who regularly eat fast food are more likely to be overweight. But a new study suggests that these kids are also more likely to be happier. Apparently, "There's a reason they're called Happy Meals." [LA Times] A Rutgers study has found that many Americans ignore food recalls. Upon hearing of a recall, only 60 percent search their homes for potentially poisonous foods, and about half of respondents said recalls have had no impact on their lives at all. [Reuters] Mark Bittman bemoans the charade that is the TV cooking show. "Hey. Things catch fire sometimes, even in 'real' kitchens," says The Minimalist. "In restaurants, good restaurants, chefs do these over. On TV, chefs gloss these over." [NY Times] Watch out, Splenda. A new fake sugar is in town: rebaudioside A, an extract from the leaves of the stevia plant, has been approved by the FDA. Green packets of it will soon join the pink, yellow and blue packets on restaurant tables. [NY Times] KFC has launched grilled chicken, which has less than half the fat and calories of the original recipe. The company tried to launch rotisserie chicken in the past unsuccessfully, but new technology is expected to improve results this time around. [Bloomberg]

A blackboard on the scene reads that the place will be called Black Horse Pub, and will open on May 30th. The website promises "British, Irish, and American dishes served up by our renowned Lancashire chef Mick Baldwin." On the drinks front: "We will be serving all your favorite liquid refreshments." Other details: Full English breakfast will be served during soccer matches, and there will also be Sunday roasts, with Yorkshire pudding and all the trimmings.

The Early Word--Park Slope's Mee Thai 
AUTHOR:
Sarah DiGregorio
DATE:
2009-04-14 15:23:00
POST:
Mediocre Thai places breed like bunnies in and around Park Slope, so the opening last June of Mee Thai on Fifth Avenue went mostly unremarked. But I stopped in for lunch today just for the hell of it, and it turned out that the food is much better than expected--making it a solid neighborhood Thai spot (a good thing to have), but not a destination by any stretch. This papaya salad looks like it went to the Top Chef School of Cooking, coaxed into a precarious, teetering tower of papaya, peanuts, tomatoes, long beans and fried shallots. But we had asked for it Thai spicy, and, happily, it came (nearly) Thai spicy. Plus, it was sauced with copious amounts of funky fish sauce and lime juice. Jungle curry--a northern Thai spicy curry made without coconut, which gets its name, I believe, because it's often made with frog, snake or other wild game--was serviceable, heavily dosed with red chiles, lemongrass and kaffir lime. We got it with shrimp because snake wasn't available. Pad-kee-mao (drunken noodle) was a delicious tangle of chewy broad noodles, egg, chile paste and basil. I think the key is to ask for dishes spicy if you want them to know you actually like Thai food, not the sugary stuff that often passes for it. Mee Thai 180 Fifth Avenue, Brooklyn 718-230-8280

Three-dollar Throwdown--Chantal's Shrimp & Baby Bok Choy Stir Fry

POST:
In case you missed it, we here at Fork in the Road have been amusing ourselves with the challenge to end all challenges, the ultimate cheap-off, a friendly contest to devise the best $3 meal: The Three-dollar Throwdown. This is my entry. But first, a bit of background. Sarah is a trained cook; Robert is a veteran food critic, which places me squarely in the role of underdog. I live on the verge of Chinatown--a block I've seen referred to as Little Chitaly--so I did my shopping close to home. And, while I can assure you that it is possible to buy three mini baby bok choy and a handful of dried shrimp, it may earn you a few grunts of disapproval. Shrimp & Baby Bok Choy Stir Fry 4 oz dried rice noodles ($0.95 for 16 oz bag) 3 baby bok choy ($1.40 per pound, $0.10 each) 1/2 bitter melon, diced ($1.40 per pound, $0.80 each) 3 cloves garlic, minced ($0.60 for a pack of 5 bulbs) 3 tbsp mini dried shrimp ($3.80 per pound, I got $0.26 worth) 1/4 cup sesame or olive oil salt and pepper to taste (Total spent: $2.91) In a medium-sized pot, bring a quart of salted water to boil. Add the noodles and let simmer until al dente. Remove from heat and drain. Place mini dried shrimp in a bowl and cover with water to reconstitute. Let soak for 20 minutes. In a large saute pan over medium heat, heat up oil. Add garlic, bitter melon, baby bok choy, salt and pepper, and saute for about 10 minutes until soft. Toss in drained noodles, then add reconstituted shrimp, as well as a healthy drizzle of the shrimpy water. Toss until shrimp is well distributed, remove from heat and serve. Note: Dried shrimp come in different sizes. I got the smallest, which look like underfed pink larvae but come to life after reconstitution--not literally--to look somewhat shrimpier and a little less like sea monkeys. Also note: This dish actually serves 2.

Three-Dollar Throwdown--Sarah's Ancho-Lime Black Bean Soup and Crispy Sweet Plantains
AUTHOR:
Sarah DiGregorio
DATE:
2009-04-14 13:00:00
POST:
All you need: $2.86 The road to this black bean soup is long, and started with a pig's foot. I was poking around my local Polish market and saw that pigs' feet were about $1 per pound. Perfect! I'd do a pied de cochon--a classic preparation in which you simmer the trotter for hours, then shred the meat and gelatinous bits off the bone and put them in a round mold (or a cookie cutter). When the mixture cools,the gelatin sets, and you've got a jiggly, meaty hockey puck of pig's foot, which you can then pan fry to crispy. I was so clever! Victory was mine! But I could only afford one teensy pig foot ($1.12), no shank attached. I simmered it until 11pm last night, until I realized that you can't really just buy one small cloven hoof, and expect it to magically yield meat. I didn't think anyone would want to eat a terrine of nothing but skin, gelatin and tendons. My dog ate the pig skin, and I abandoned my pied de cochon, feeling like one of the dumber contestants on Top Chef, who decides to do a braise with a 15 minute time limit. Time was running out but victory could still be mine! I went to my local Mexican bodega, where there's a good selection of dried chiles for 99 cents. Black beans were on sale, and the fat, ripe plantains and limes were practically free. Back to the Polish market, where they don't mind if you break a head of garlic and only buy a few cloves, because that's the kind of thing that the old ladies who shop there do. My Three-Dollar Throwdown accounting book: 1 ripe yellow plantain: .40 1 lime: .25 7 cloves garlic: .23 1 (15.5 ounce) can black beans: .99 1 (1.5 ounce) bag ancho chiles: .99 Total: $2.86 I think I should get points for being under $3. Plus, I submit for your consideration the fact that my meal would serve two people. The recipe and results, after the jump. Ancho-Lime Black Bean Soup and Crispy Sweet Plantains A simple puree of dried chiles, garlic, water and salt, creates a miraculously deeply flavored base. Anchos are sweet and mildly hot, and have a dark raisiny flavor. This basic concoction--dried chiles, garlic and salt pureed with a bit of water--is the starting point for many classic Mexican marinades and stews, or can be used as is for a simple, taqueria-style salsa. Don't skip the step of toasting the chiles and garlic on a dry griddle--it deepens and sweetens the flavor. Ancho-Lime Black Bean Soup Yield: about 2 servings 3 dried ancho chiles 7 cloves garlic, unpeeled 2 cups water salt and pepper 2 tablespoons canola oil 1 (15.5 ounce) can black beans, drained and rinsed zest of 1 lime juice of 1/2 lime On a dry skillet or griddle over medium-high heat, toast the chiles, pressing them into the pan with a spatula, until their color darkens slightly and they begin to soften. Place the chiles in a bowl, and cover with warm water. Set aside. Place the garlic cloves, still in their papery skins, on the skillet, and toast until the cloves soften and develop browned spots. Pull the garlic cloves out of their skins, and place in a blender. Drain the chiles, tear off the stems, and place the chiles in the blender. Add generous pinches of salt and pepper and 2 cups water. Blend until smooth. In a saucepan over medium heat, warm the oil. Add the chile-garlic mixture, and cook until warmed through and fragrant. Add the beans, and cook until warmed through. Zest the lime, and set the zest aside. Squeeze the juice of 1/2 of the lime into the soup.Taste for seasoning, and add more salt if necessary. Transfer soup back to the blender, and blend until smooth. To serve, lade soup into two bowls, and garnish with the lime zest. Crispy Sweet Plantains Yield: 2 servings Yellow plantains are sweet and ripe when their skins are totally black 1 large, ripe yellow plantain canola oil for frying salt Peel the plantain, and slice into 1/2-inch thick slices. Pour the oil into a skillet to a depth of about a 1/2 inch. Warm the oil over high heat, until it's hot enough that a plantain slice placed in the oil sizzles immediately. Slide all the plantain slices into the oil, and fry about 2 minutes on each side, until plantains are golden brown and crisp. Remove plantains to a paper towel to drain, and sprinkle liberally with salt. Serve hot.

I eagerly accepted Fork in the Road's Three-Dollar Throwdown challenge, but realized it would take a lot of?effort to accomplish the task. The prohibition of using any flour, spices, or even--egad!--small quantities of wine not purchased within the $3 maximum expenditure meant that I had to forego my usual style of cooking, in which I desperately grab diverse ingredients from the spice rack and refrigerator, in an attempt to "save" my improvised recipes. crouch and make the jump to see what I came up with I knew that I had to find a market where you could buy incredibly small quantities of things, so I settled on Chelsea Market. I snagged?a single overripe plum tomato ($0.29), the smallest shallot I could find ($0.18), and two button mushrooms ($0.07). I went to the fish market and, ignoring the glare of the cashier, purchased five of the smallest shrimp ($1.75), and found out that shrimp were more expensive than I thought. I went to the bakery and bought a tiny baguette, known as a baguettine ($0.50). Total expenditure: $2.79,?21 cents under the limit. I first boiled the shrimp, shells on to extract maximum flavor, in a half cup of?rapidly boiling water for one minute,?removed them and reserved the liquid. I?sliced and sauteed the mushrooms in butter till they were?well-browned, and set them aside. In a non-stick skillet, I?sauteed the chopped shallot in olive oil,?then added the?chopped plum tomato and cooked?until it turned soft. Then I added the shrimp?broth and cooked the sauce down to an almost-paste.?Finally, I split the baguettine and assembled the sandwich. Here is the?result: ?

Guinness has unveiled a new stout available for a limited time in the US. The maltier, fizzier Guinness 250th Anniversary Stout can be poured all in one shot, unlike the original which requires a two-part pour. [MSNBC] Since Cristal's maker revealed that he would rather not have hip-hop artists associated with this product, Jay-Z has been brandishing bottles of Armand de Brignac in his videos. Now, the small champagne house says demand is so high that it could sell its entire annual production several times over. [Independent] The Times has posted a collection of comments to its Proof blog, as part of the blog's Last Call roundup. The blog, which ran from late last year until early this month, featured writers musing about their relationship to alcohol. The blog is expected to start again at some point. [NY Times] Eric Asimov touts the virtues of wine on tap. Serving wine out of kegs cuts out packaging costs and can help to keep wines fresher than they would be in bottles. [NY Times]

Bird in a Gilded Cage--Sweetiepie

?One of your seating options at Sweetiepie is in a very small prison cell. Have you been a baddiekins? (The answer is apparently yes, considering the skull-and-crossbones handbag on the empty chair.) I'd passed and repassed Sweetiepie--open several weeks now on Greenwich Avenue--thinking it was one of those desserts-only restaurants, which I regard as a bad sign about the direction the restaurant industry is taking. I thought it was just another indicator that the Age of Foodism might be in its death throes, as restaurants desperately cast about, flopping around like fish?to find?unique and novel formulae that will make the customers come back. After all, two dessert restaurants, Pong and Mama's Mudsliders (like Sweetiepie, these places tend to have awful childish names), had recently gone belly-up in the West Village. Well I finally had a chance to look at the menu online, and Sweetiepie is not a dessert place but a comfort food restaurant, with a?plain and boring-sounding menu that runs to hamburgers, spilt pea soup, spaghetti and meatballs, and iceberg-wedge salad. The desserts, too, are plain, and occupy a fraction of the menu. The lure is the gilded surroundings: the interior design is the message, not the menu. Another lure is the infantilization of the diner. 19 Greenwich Avenue, 212-337-3333

The Early Word--Farinella, Pizza from a Neapolitan Rapper

POST:
Given the fetishization of pizza and pizzaiolos--Keste's uber-authentic wood-burning oven, Dom DeMarco's windowsill herbs, et al--I'm surprised that downtown's new pizza spot, Farinella, hasn't gotten more attention. It's run by a real, live Neapolitan! A real, live Neapolitan rapper, to be precise, named Alberto Polo Cretara. Check out his YouTube user page, and you'll find his group's music videos, an interview with an Italian television station about Farinella, as well as the information that the school he attended is called "University of the Street." You know that one, right? But besides the University of the Street, Cretara actually trained at Roman pizza spot Forno Campo di Fiori, and he's now fabricating Roman-style pies. It turns out that Cretara makes some good pizza, and one really, really good eggplant panini. We stopped by for lunch today, and Cretara wasn't around, but two extremely striking, extremely Italian women were behind the counter. There are about a dozen pizzas available--mushroom, zucchini, cotto-arugula, procuitto--made in large oblongs and sliced crossways to serve. We tried the margherita pizza with buffalo mozzarella and the Sicilian, a simple, tomato sauced, eggplant slice. The crust, while fine, needs work--it was tough, and under-seasoned. But the tomato sauce was vibrantly tomatoey and sweet, and the sautéed eggplant on the Sicilian was delicious. What was stellar, though, was the eggplant panini. The purple chunks of eggplant were stewed down to silk, and was enriched with smoked mozzarella; it's on homemade bread made from the pizza dough, and drips olive oil. I wouldn't travel for this sandwich, but if I worked anywhere in the vicinity, I'd have it for lunch at least once a week. Farinella 90 Worth Street 212-608-3222

Announcing the Three-Dollar Throwdown--An Exercise in Extreme Frugality
AUTHOR:

DATE:

POST:
(To the tune of the Subway $5 Footlong song): Three... Three-dollar... Three-dollar Throwdown. You've always known us as proficient penny pinchers. Over a boozy meeting last week, we decided to put our thriftiness to the test. Welcome to the Three-dollar Throwdown, wherein we at Fork in the Road compete against ourselves and our readers to create the tastiest, most inventive and most satisfying meal... all for just $3. The rules: 1. You must buy all ingredients whole. (i.e., If your recipe calls for flour, you must buy the whole bag... unless you can find a place that sells loose flour! Also, you can't buy half an onion.) 2. You must spend no more than a total of $3 on all ingredients required for your recipe not counting salt, pepper and oil. 3. You must submit your recipe by 1pm Tuesday, April 14... that's exactly 24 hours from now! To participate, please send your entries to Sarah DiGregorio at sdigregorio@villavoice.com. The winner will be picked based on user feedback and general consensus.

Photo borrowed from iVillage's Food Rush Donatella Arpaia may have her hands full with the recently opened Anthos Upstairs and the upcoming Viceroy Miami restaurant, but she has still managed to find time to keep us up to date on all her news in her new guest blogging spot on iVillage's Food Rush. The restauratrix reveals her go-to pasta recipe and divulges this little-known fact: "A restaurateur's kitchen is often not well stocked, because we usually eat in our restaurants." Do tell.

Cookbook Tester--Suvir Saran's American Masala
AUTHOR:
Sarah DiGregorio
DATE:
2009-04-13 9:46:00
POST:
Suvir Saran, chef of Devi, has just opened a casual spot in Jersey City called American Masala. That also happens to be the name of the chef's most recent cookbook, and from what I gather, the concept behind the book and the restaurant are the same: simple, Western food (burgers, pasta, chili) tweaked with Indian spices and ingredients. I tested Saran's recipe for homemade tomato chutney, and then the recipe for salmon en papillote with tomato chutney. The results, after the jump. This picture sucks, but the dish, thankfully, did not suck. I used arctic char instead of salmon because farmed salmon is not a sustainable choice, and wild salmon, while sustainable, costs about as much as I make in a year. Arctic char has rich, pink flesh very similar to salmon--and it's also pretty affordable. I started with the tomato chutney recipe, and found that it worked very well, with the exception of Saran's odd advice that the chutney is just as good made with "winter-pale" tomatoes. Eww. I can't imagine that that's true, so I used a 28-ounce can of crushed San Marzano tomatoes. But because of the more liquid consistency of the canned tomatoes, my chutney never really reduced to a jammy consistency. It was more like a thick sauce. Which was fine--the flavor is really beautiful, the combination of the sharply fragrant curry leaves, chiles and mustard seeds and sweet tomato is delicious. I bet it would be even better with fresh tomatoes in season. The ingredient list is long, but once you have the spices, throwing the chutney together is very easy. Here's the recipe: Better-Than-Ketchup Tomato Chutney Yield: about 3 cups Adapted from American Masala 1/4 cup canola oil 36 curry leaves, roughly torn 2 teaspoons mustard seeds 2 teaspoons cumin seeds 12 dried red chiles 1/2 teaspoon turmeric 3 1/2 pounds tomatoes (about 6 or 7), cored and roughly chopped 1 (4.4-ounce) tube double-concentrated tomato paste or 1 (9-ounce) can tomato paste 2 tablespoons sugar 1 1/2 tablespoons kosher salt 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper 1 teaspoon sambhar or rasam powder, or 1/2 teaspoon curry powder In a large pot or skillet over medium-high heat, warm the oil with the curry leaves, mustard seeds, cumin seeds, and chiles until the cumin is browned, about 2 minutes. Add the turmeric, and cook until the chiles darken, 1 to 2 minutes longer. Add the remaining ingredients, and cook for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally and pressing the tomatoes against the sides of the pot to mash them if they are not breaking up on their own. Reduce the heat to medium and cook until the chutney is thick and jammy, stirring often, an additional 20 to 35 minutes. If you are using hard winter tomatoes [don't!], the chutney may cook in less time, as there is less tomato juice to reduce. Taste for seasoning, transfer to a covered plastic container, and refrigerate for up to 1 week, or ladle into dry and sterilized jars and can according to the manufacturer's instructions. Then I used the chutney to season the fish, as described in this recipe: Salmon "en Papillote" with Tomato Chutney Yield: 6 servings Adapted from American Masala 2 1/4 cups Better-than-Ketchup Tomato Chutney 6 salmon fillets [try to chose arctic char or wild salmon] 1 tablespoon kosher salt 1 teaspoon black pepper chopped cilantro, for serving lemon or lime wedges, for serving Preheat the oven to 450 degrees. Cut six pieces of aluminum foil about 15 inches long, and place them on your work surface. Add 3 tablespoons tomato chutney to the center of each piece of foil, and place a fillet on top skin-side down. Season each piece of salmon with salt and ground pepper, and top with another 3 tablespoons tomato chutney. Bring both long sides of the foil up over the salmon, and fold the edges over twice to seal (allow some space to remain between the top of the salmon and the foil--the foil should not be flush to the fish). Fold up the short ends of the foil, completely sealing the salmon within the foil package. Place all the packages on a rimmed baking sheet, and roast for 10 minutes. Remove the baking sheet from the oven, and open one package to see if the salmon is cooked to your preferred degree of doneness, by flaking the center of the fillet with a paring knife or fork. If it is too rare, simply refold the package and let sit for a couple of minutes. The heat within the package will continue to cook the fillet, even though it is out of the oven. When the fish is cooked to your liking, unfold or cut open the packets, slide the fish and sauce out, sprinkle with cilantro, and serve with lemon or lime wedges.

Yelpers Find Worst Restaurant Bathroom in City
AUTHOR:

POST:
The bathroom at the Taco Bell on 14th Street between University and Fifth Avenue (click to examine more closely) Rummaging through Yelp the other day, Fork in the Road discovered some of the worst reviews we'd seen in a long while, and they focused on the bathroom at a local Taco Bell. Here are some examples: more scary stuff, after the jump And another Yelp review, from Matt J. in Manhattan: "This place is full of degenerates, annoying homeless people, and emo kids as far as the eye can see. Seriously. When did emo kids start hanging out in Taco Bell? Bad food, although I had a nice cashier. Unfortunately I had to pee after my meal. The bathroom looked like someone really sick had awful diarrhea and didn't care to get it in the toilet, but instead all over the wall and floor and sink probably. I feel bad for the people who work here." So, Fork in the Road sent an investigative reporter to the location. We discovered that the bathroom, metal door ajar, sits right inside the front door of the place, making it possible for anyone on the street to dart in for any purpose. Inside, the bathoom must have been designed by the same person who did the cells at Rykers, because it's clad all in stainless steel, and there are curious streaks all over the walls. Here's another view, showing the dodgy toilet. We haven't seen such a bathroom since we visited the one in Tompkins Square recently.  (click if you dare)

BRUNCH, the musical, offered New York chefs, waiters, restaurant managers and bartenders free tickets to the 8pm performance last night, on Easter Sunday, in an effort to give back to the community that inspired the show. [Broadway World] Queens shoppers who bought bitter melon recently were surprised to find that, upon slicing open the cucumber-shaped gourd, baggies of a mysterious white powder were found inside. Police have yet to confirm it as a drug smuggling gone wrong. [NY Times] The fishing of chinook, also known as king salmon, off the coast of California and much of Oregon has been banned for the second year in a row after a record low count of the species returned to the area in 2007. [SF Chronicle] When American gins are put to the test, interesting botanicals win out over blander vodka-like distillations. But will local brands ever be more more popular than London dry? [Wall Street Journal] A man whose 10% Starbucks gold card was not honored at a New Jersey location because, as a franchise, the store is individually owned and managed, received a $50 gift card from the company as an apology. [Consumerist] Are you a too-fast eater? Slow down with the waiting game solution, says, Dr. Pavel Somov, which involves resting your hands between bites, chewing thoroughly and counting chips.

Photo by Bruce_Lee @ Flickr Eat Me Daily asks, "How knowledgeable is Mark Bittman about fish?" EMD calls out The New York Times dining section after Grist editor Tom Philpott called out Bittman for recommending a recipe for red snapper, a species that has been dangerously depleted due to overfishing. Philpott's rant bring up an interesting question: just how responsible are food writers for educating the public on how to eat well and sustainably? In Bittman's case, the answer appears to be responsible enough, considering he touts himself as a locavore and a conscientious eater. Bittman has apologized for his oversight and promised to address the issue in his column shortly. Considering today's post, it's sure to be a fishy next few days on Bitten.

Italian Easter Bread at Villabate Bakery
AUTHOR:
Sarah DiGregorio

POST:
Robert recently wrote about sanguinaccio, the Lenten chocolate pudding made with fresh pigs' blood available at Bensonhurst's Villabate Bakery. Villabate was opened in 1980 by a Sicilian family, and is one of the best old-school Italian bakeries in the city. (The Grand Opening sign is there because they recently moved to a larger location, half a block down.) Yesterday, I stopped in looking for something less bloody: Italian Easter bread. My mother used to make this yeasty, eggy, sweet-citrusy bread every year. We made it in the shape of a ring, the surface dotted with colored Easter eggs and sprinkles. Many traditionally Catholic countries celebrate the end of Lent with an elaborate bread, made into a cross (for obvious reasons), or into a ring (to symbolize the crown of thorns). Eggs have been celebrated a symbol of spring and new life since Pagan times, and Christians co-opted them as a symbol of Christ's rebirth. Plus, for centuries the Catholic church forbid eggs during Lent, so by the time Easter rolled around, everyone would be pretty excited about eating eggs again. Villabate was hopping yesterday, the crush of people picking up Easter goodies. By the time I left, the line was out the door. But I did manage to score two small Easter breads. They are wonderful: mildly sweet and eggy, a bit like brioche, and orange-scented. Plus, displayed behind protective plastic wrap (that's why the picture is so bad), were elaborate marzipan dioramas, mainly composed of marzipan lambs lying down with mini Snickers, in trippy, neon landscapes. Much cooler than a hollow chocolate bunny in a basket filled with plastic green grass. Villabate Bakery 7001 18th Avenue, Brooklyn 718-331-8430

But, peddling over to one of the few remaining Burger Kings downtown, the one on Delancey, we discovered something perturbing. see what we found, after the jump Despite the artistically squirted ketchup, and distracting pair of pickles, it was immediately apparent that, though we'd purchased two burgers, we were really only given one.

Incredibly Cheap Eats--Cantonese Roasts at Dai Wah Yummy City
AUTHOR:
Sarah DiGregorio
DATE:

POST:
Bensonhurst, Brooklyn is perhaps best known for its Italian bakeries and pork shops, but as Robert pointed out in his column on Bensonhurst's Bamboo Pavilion this week, Chinese businesses are cropping up all over 18th Avenue. Robert predicts the neighborhood will become a full-fledged Chinatown soon. I trundled down to Bensonhurst looking for Italian Easter bread (more on that tomorrow), but the exuberantly named Dai Wah Yummy City lured me inside with a roast half pig dangling in the window. The restaurant is relatively new (I believe it opened last spring), and was full of families sitting around large tables, slurping noodles and eating Cantonese roasts. Dim sum carts with steamer containers inside were also sitting in the dining room, although they seemed to be dormant today. Yummy City's menu is encyclopedic, and includes a slew of Cantonese casseroles, noodle soups, clams with black bean sauce, goose feet with black mushroom, conch with chive, and so on, as well as Americanized stuff like General Tso's chicken and sweet and sour chicken. But the roasts definitely seemed like the thing to do, and so I did them. A large plate of pig, hacked from the haunch, along with a portion of roast duck set me back only $4.50. Above, that's pig to the left, duck to the right, and black vinegar for dipping. The pig was delicious--star-anise-scented flesh interspersed with snowy white fat and capped with salty, crackly-dry skin. The duck was a bit bony and fatty, but the lacquered skin was lovely. Yummy City, indeed. Dai Wah Yummy City 7218 18th Avenue, Bensonhurst, Brooklyn 718-837-8818

This is not news and that place isn't even one of the top in the nabe. Bensonhurst is probably one of the best, and cheapest, places to eat in the city. $2.50 per roll for sushi on average. Amazing pizza and Italian food(but you knew that already). Phenomenal Turkish food. Top notch Chinese and Vietnamese food. John's Deli Solid Mexican food. Average prices are extremely low. I hate eating outside of this area. Oh, and if Bensonhurst isn't ALREADY a full fledged China town you haven't been on the D train near Bay Parkway recently.

We Get Tempted By Tanteo Infused Tequilas
AUTHOR:
Chantal Martineau
DATE:
2009-04-9 14:16:00
POST:
We finally got a chance to try the recently launched Tanteo brand of infused tequilas. Now, I know what you're thinking: flavored tequila? Isn't that just a sneeze away from Bacardi Limon? And the answer is: not at all. Or at least not in this case. Tanteo, which is made of 100% Weber blue agave and comes in japaleño, chocolate and tropical fruit flavors, is redolent of real ingredients. The jalapeño has a nose filled with grass and green pepper, while the chocolate is more mole than milk dud--although there is some malt there--with its silky mouthfeel and piquant finish. The tropical fruit is all flowers on the nose, but is also hinted with jalapeño heat, which makes it reminiscent of the fresh-cut mango sprinkled in salt and pepper you get on the street in Mexico. In all cases, but especially with the jalapeño, which is the most popular of the three, the heat from the pepper fuses with the heat from the alcohol, causing your brain to process the two simultaneously so you don't end up overwhelmed by either. Tanteo is only allowed to exist because the Consejo Regular de Tequila, a government body in Mexico that regulates tequila the way the French regulate wine, ruled in 2006 that tequilas could be infused. It makes for a decent sipping tequila but is designed to be mixed into cocktails, like this margarita: Margarita Tanteo 1.75 oz Tanteo Jalapeño 0.75 oz Grand Marnier 1.5 oz fresh lime juice 0.5 oz agave nectar 4 lime wedges In a shaker, muddle lime wedges and agave nectar. Add remaining ingredients and ice. Shake and finely strain. Serve in a chilled margarita glass or over ice in a rocks glass. Garnish with a lime wheel.

But there is that paradox of knowing how that scrumptious porterhouse made it to my dinner plate. We have lost any kind of reverence for this. It would be interesting if people would have to kill an animal themselves before they earned the right to eat it."

You probably know Etsy, the website that brings together hundreds of small, home-grown businesses--letting you buy a homemade knit cap from some crafty girl in Vancouver, or a "dog necklace" from a quirky jewelry maker in Los Angeles.  Now there's a similar website for food, Foodzie, which launched in December. It's like a big online farmers' market or gigantic, nation-wide bake sale. You can search for products by location, product-type, or even by categories like women-owned and antioxidant. There's aronia berry syrup from the Twisp River Valley in Washington State; Oregon Dukkah, a Middle Eastern spice-nut mix made with Oregon hazelnuts (shown left, courtesy Foodzie); ginger and pistachio sea salt caramels from Illinois; and Black Forest bison jerky from Colorado Springs, among many other small-batch products.

POST:
When Eater reported on the New York restaurants that were among the highest grossing in the nation, I was astonished. I guess I expected Tavern on the Green to be there, but I never expected the list to be such a celebration of mediocrity. Number 5 on the list--grossing 24.4 million--was Tao, a midtown pan-Asian where the food may only be termed adequate--and that's being generous. Since it's not online, I dug out my review that was published at the time. And this morning on NY 1, I discovered that sister restaurant Tao Las Vegas is the number one grossing restaurant in the country. The whole thing suggests that the restaurants we idolize are really also-rans when it comes to success measured in dollar terms. Still, I'm sure Tao Vegas might be considered a total failure, when compared to McDonald's. see the original 2000 review of Tao, after the jump hed: Temple of Doom kicker: Buddha Wakes Up in Hell A new circle of hell has been prepared, and Tao is its name. A bright red marquee blazes outside, and the interior--whittled from a former movie theater, the Palace--is attained through a pair of adamantine doors. Just inside the gates sits Cerberus in a very short skirt, checking reservations. Soon you will be sent with a vibrating beeper into the bar, where lost souls in leather pants sit chain smoking in pools of harsh light. Through a stand of bamboo a giant Buddha rears up, his sixteen-foot stone eminence floating above a pool of water. Oddly, his left nipple is erect, as if someone had been twiddling it just prior to your arrival. Wall niches hold ancillary deities, and a stairway leads down to a men's room, where the chief attraction is communal urination onto a backlit sheet of green glass. Beware the inevitable splash. The massive main floor seats two hundred, and there are additional mezzanine tables. Highest of all, the old projection booth is set up for Lucifer's very special friends. Looking down at midnight one evening was a Brueghelian vision of hell: the large table in front of Buddha squirmed with inebriated louts shouting themselves red-faced over the throbbing bass of an unrecognizable dance tune. Better not ask what Buddha is doing in a joint named Tao. This fundamental confusion extends to the menu, which was conceived to offer a cook's tour of Asian cuisines, or at least Asian neighborhood restaurants. Chinese is represented by hoisin explosion chicken ($18), a salty stir-fry of boneless white meat and bell pepper that's considerably improved by its handful of crunchy almonds. Nonetheless, the quality is a step below what you can get from a good carryout, and you'll look in vain for any actual hoisin sauce. Even less appealing are the Shanghai soup dumplings ($8 for five), which are predictably soupless, and ensconced in a thick wrapper that packs all the charm of unbaked bread dough. The crisply fried lobster-and-shrimp dumplings are much better, but--though the handsome plate is dramatically garnished with lobster shell--the inside tastes only like shrimp. Making the reasonable assumption that there must be some good dishes on the menu of this wildly popular hotspot, if only by the law of averages, this downtown pilgrim made a good-faith effort to seek them out. Thai fish hot pot ($20) arrived with a pleasant lemongrass tang and a generous assortment of seafood. A side dish of Chinese long beans ($8) boasted a Hong-Kong-style XO sauce that, while not among the great ones, was entirely adequate. Among appetizers, the fried oysters were crisply cooked, while the spare ribs one evening tasted skanky and torturously sweet. Though it showcased nine good-sized shrimp, the "braised prawns with chive flowers" had been steamed instead of braised, and the underlying chives overcooked in a brackish sauce. At the tiny-but-pricey sushi bar, the commerce is mainly in premade maki rolls, of which my favorite is yellowtail and jalapeno ($9). Then again, maybe this isn't a new realm of hell. Maybe the experts mapped it long ago. Dante's third circle is reserved for gluttons, whose unnatural appetites in life stuck them there. They are still given plenty to eat. Only now, instead of gourmet fare, they're force-fed muck. TAO 42 East 58th Street, 212-888-2288. Open Monday through Friday 11:30 a.m. till 3:30 p.m. for lunch, 3:30 p.m. till 5 p.m. just for sushi, and 5:30 till midnight for dinner; Saturday and Sunday, dinner only. All major credit cards, downstairs bathroom wheelchair equipped.

Real Dives--Denny's Steak Pub in Kensington, Brooklyn
AUTHOR:
Sarah DiGregorio

POST:
 Real Dives: In which we recommend authentically divey dive bars. A real dive bar may be characterized by low prices, clientele over 60, trucker hats only on actual truckers, a long history, lotto, lack of ironic PBR, and a sense that the place is not trying to impress you, or anyone else, ever. The kind of bar you worry will soon be replaced by some godawful glass condo. Today's Dive: Denny's Steak Pub Clientele: White men, over 40 On the walls: Stucco; four televisions: one playing My Man Godfrey (1938, Carole Lombard and William Powell), the other three playing baseball; a black and white photo of the original Denny's in the 1950s at 7th Avenue and 9th Street in Park Slope; FDNY crest; a sign that reads: 'Denny's Sports Bar, den of delinquents.' On the sound system: Frank Sinatra, basic jukebox top 40 On tap: Bud, Sam Adams Summer Ale What to drink: Stiff pours of Jameson, $4.50, two for one during happy hour Overheard: "What would you like to hear, some Doris Day?" (A sarcastic comment from a patron manning the jukebox.) "Can I tell the story first and then you can mock me?" Said to us, as we left: "Run away, this place is nothing but trouble." Note: Denny's is right in the middle of what is now the Bangladeshi part of Kensington, so after you get a drink at Denny's, walk just a half block for good Bangla food at Jhinuk or Suganda restaurant. Paan sellers line the sidewalk. Denny's Steak Pub 106 Beverley Road, Brooklyn

Mondo Carne--Horse Meat in Cans
AUTHOR:
Robert Sietsema
DATE:

POST:
 Weird how our pets are allowed to eat horse meat, but we're not. Some of my finest memories of eating in northern Italy (they also love horse meat in France), involve dining on horse, ass, and donkey meat that has been pounded thin, breaded, and fried into schnitzels. The animals that end up at the horse butchers have had long and productive lives, and part of good animal husbandry involves making sure that no meat goes to waste. The horse meat is tough and is more strongly flavored than beef, which is why it's treated like a chicken fried steak. If we can eat buffalo and emu, what sort of weird-ass squeamishness prevents?Americans from eating horse?

Next time you're in DiPalo's take a good look the items displayed on the wall behind the counter. There you'll find several little jars, one rabbit, one ostrich, and, if memory serves one horse. None are for sale at the shop though. There's a reason the jars are so small, back in Italy they're marketed as baby food.

How old is that photo? Horsemeat hasn't been used in American pet food in about 30 years. Horses are treated as companion animals, work animals, and athletes, almost all horse products are labeled "not for horses intended for human consumption."

Robert, you should google "glue ingredients." Most modern glues (like Elmer's) are synthetic. There are some hide-based glues used in manufacturing, but cattle hide is far more available. There are only 9 million total horses in the US, but every year we slaughter 35 million cattle for meat. Meat animals are raised for meat, they don't do anything else. They go from farm to feed lot to slaughter in a short time. Horses are barely even starting training at the age most cattle are slaughtered. They travel all over, being exposed to diseases, getting vaccinated and treated. Here's a list of 257 horse medications labeled only for non-meat horses: http://bit.ly/rVZ14 That doesn't include all the shampoos, ointments, grooming products, etc. that are also not approved for meat animals.

I took the photo yesterday, but the can is older--a friend acquired it in Michigan about 15 years ago. Still, my point still stands: Why aren't we allowed to eat horsemeat, when we can eat buffalo, ostrich, emu, turtle, frog, and rabbit (can't a rabbit be a "companion animal," whatever that is?). After all, superannuated horses are used to make glue and gummy bears.

Is Your Meat In Season?
AUTHOR:
Chantal Martineau
DATE:
2009-04-8 15:40:00
POST:
Photo by VirtualErn @ Flickr The Atlantic Food Channel has an interesting piece on the seasonality of meat. Most of the animals we eat graze on pasture, and so it makes sense that grass--like other vegetation--should peak at a certain time of the year and that, in turn, whatever is eating that grass should also peak while the eating's good. This is an excellent argument for having a slaughtering and butchering season. But a meat-eating season? This concept is obsolete in these, our refrigerated times. Besides, would Bill and Nicolette Niman of Niman Ranch, who penned the piece, really want people to only buy their meat when it's in season? Seems like it would make for a pretty lean other nine months of the year. But maybe, being the meat lovers that we are, we just can't bear the idea of going an entire season without it.

French-Canadian Dream--Real Poutine Coming to New York... Finally!

POST:
Photo by jonathunder @ Flickr As a displaced Montrealer, I naturally miss the tastes of home. Of course, living in New York, it's not too hard to stay gastronomically satisfied. But, just as Sarah DiGregorio states in her column this week, New Yorkers who leave home crave pizza, Californians miss tacos and the Quebecois long for poutine. Poutine (literally translating as a "mess" of fries, gravy and cheese curds) is about to come to New York... again. But I'm hoping that this time, a born-and-bred Quebecois can make it right. New Yorkers have seen poutine before. LW12 in the MePa district had several versions of it on the menu, but is now closed (hopefully not because of the fat-tacular dish). And EV Belgian fries joint Pommes Frites has one on the menu, but it's made with shredded yellow! cheddar cheese, which is just plain wrong. Every self-respecting French-Canadian knows that the key to good poutine is the cheese curd. These salty, squeaky chunks of what would eventually become cheddar if allowed to age are best enjoyed day-fresh. Not sure where Thierry Pepin, owner of the soon-to-open (but not freakin' soon enough) T-Poutine, will get his cheese curds. But I'm betting that, as a fellow countryman, he knows just how important those little salty morsels will be to the success of his venture.

I loved reading your article on Poutine! I work at the "Chese Curd Capital of Wisconsin" in Ellsworth, Wisconsin. Our cheese curds are so famous that they are asked for by name. In fact, it was the Governor of Wisconsin that gave us the title. "Cheese Curd Capital of Wisconsin". He tried our cheese curds and fell in love. You are so right when you state that quality cheese curds begin with quality milk. Our fresh, squeaky cheddar morsels are white - the color of fresh white milk! They are ALL NATURAL and made from farmer certified rBST free milk. When people ask us why our cheese curds are only white... We ask them: "Did you ever drink a glass of orange milk?" ALL NATURAL! We are in numerous restaurants nationwide. We are in numerous grocery chains nationwide. We sent our first samples to the UK awhile back and hope to be world wide soon. The longest lines at State Fairs lead to the cheese curds! Ellsworth Cooperative Creamery Cheese Curds. *We are also at Murray's Cheese in NYC!

POST:
Just as promised in our weekly dining newsletter, we bring you Chef Benny Bartolotta's recipe for Inzimino Di Calamari, one of Osteria del Circo's featured $6 Tuscan tapas available on the bar menu. Yield: 4 servings 2 lbs calamari 1/2 lb black kale 1/2 Swiss chard 1 small onion, chopped 1 medium carrot, chopped 3 stalks celery, chopped 1 clove garlic, chopped 2 cups cooked chickpeas 2 tbsp tomato paste 2 stems rosemary, chopped 5 sprigs of rosemary (for garnish) 3/4 cup extra virgin olive oil 1 cup white wine salt and peperoncino, to taste 4 pieces crostino Clean calamari and cut into 1/2 inch strips. Wash the Swiss chard and kale, and chop coarsely. In a large pot, bring 2 quarts of salted water to a boil, add the greens and cook until tender. In a large sauté pan over medium heat, heat up half the oil and sauté the onion, carrot and celery for about 10 minutes. Add the garlic and sauté for another 2 minutes. Add the calamari, tossing gently, and sauté for 8 minutes. Add the white wine and reduce until completely evaporated. Finally, toss in the chickpeas, Swiss chard, kale, tomato paste and 6 cups of water. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. Cook for 20 minutes or until the calamari is tender, stirring intermittently. Sprinkle the chopped rosemary into the mixture, and season with salt and peperoncino. Gently stir in the remaining olive oil and remove from heat. To plate this Tuscan specialty, simply place the crostino on the bottom of the dish and spoon the inzimino with all its juices over top. Drizzle with extra virgin olive oil and garnish with a sprig of rosemary. Buon appetito!

This week, check out my review of Wechsler's Currywurst and Bratwurst, a new temple to German sausage (and friends) on First Avenue. Andre Wechsler, a native of Germany, left his job in finance to open his little shop--a good move, as sausages seem a better (and happier) bet than stocks right now. In fact, Wechsler comes from a long line of Bavarian butchers--one wall in the restaurant displays a large black and white photo of his great-grandparents in their butcher shop. The currywurst is deliciously junky, composed of a good-quality pork and veal sausage smothered in the mysterious curry sauce, which tastes to me like equal parts ketchup, barbecue sauce and Japanese curry. Other sausages are equally good. I especially liked the skinny, darkly spiced merguez. Click the clickity above to read the full review. Wechsler's Currywurst & Bratwurst 120 First Avenue, no phone

Pix from Bamboo Pavilion

POST:
 Located smack dab in the middle of a Sicilian neighborhood in Bensonhurst, Bamboo Pavilion (see our review here) is on the sharp cutting edge of Sichuan cuisine in New York. While the food can't compete with the stalls of Flushing in sheer peppercorn-hotness, it makes up for it in nuanced splendor. With its intricate combinations of chile oil, fresh green chiles, pickled chiles, and chile flakes, the food at Bamboo Garden makes a convincing case for Sichuan being one of the subtlest and most well developed cuisines?in the world. More exciting food photos?below.  Vegetarians will delight in the mushrooms-only menu, of which the above features five types of wild 'shrooms.  The cooks do amazing things with almost-raw vegetables, including a brief stir-fry of spuds and peppers that leave both still crisp and glistening with flavorful oil.  The whole-fish presentations are glorious, swimming in sauce, such as the Sichuan pickled whole fish (above) and the whole fish in hot bean sauce (below)

Why Does Bacon Taste So Good? It's All About the Maillard Reaction

POST:
 Atkins dieters may be disappointed to discover that a high-protein diet may not be as healthy as once believed. A recent study conducted on rats suggests that a diet high in protein combined with a lot of fat increases the risk of diabetes. [Forbes] Meanwhile, British scientists have pinpointed the exact chemical reaction that makes bacon so tasty. The Maillard reaction, which occurs between an amino acid and a reducing sugar when heated, releases the smells and flavors that make people salivate. [Telegraph] Is 2009 the year of the banh mi? So far, yes. The New York Times has a banh mi map to help you navigate the city's Franco-Vietnamese sandwich route. [NY Times] Oops! Filipino fishermen accidentally caught and ate a rare megamouth shark, according to the World Wildlife Fund. The 1,100-pound, 13-foot shark, one of only 40 ever seen, died while struggling in the fishermen's net, so they took it home and cooked it. [AP] Marie Claire goes mythbusting, further evidencing the beginning of the backlash against organic food. Its "6 Myths About Organic Food" points out that organic farming is half as productive as high-yield farming and that if everyone went organic, we'd have to cut down 10 million square miles of forest.

Keeping It Kosher--Wine Recommendations for Passover Meal
AUTHOR:

POST:
It's that time of year again, when everyone likes to round up the best kosher wines to pair with traditional Seder fare. The Feed lists several Israeli Cabernet Sauvignons, including one from Bazelet Hagolan in the Golan Heights. Tasting Table offers up a couple less conventional options, such as the 2005 Capcanes Peraj Ha'Abib Montsant from Spain, which sells for a whopping $60, and the more reasonably priced 2007 Alfasi Cabernet Sauvignon Reserve from Valle del Maule in Chile. And Grub Street speaks to Michael Dorf of City Winery, who suggests Covenant Red C and Four Gates Merlot, both from California. Our favorite kosher wine rec comes from Gourmet, which goes as far as to suggest an entirely kosher champagne cocktail. We recommend making it with Yarden's NV Blanc de Blancs.

Organ Recital--The Baroque Wonder of Head Cheese
AUTHOR:
Robert Sietsema
DATE:
2009-04-7 15:31:00
POST:
But Mario Batali reinvigorated the species by serving it warm and crumbly and scented with spices, and other restaurants soon followed suit. Still, there were plenty of excellent rustic examples all around us, often to be found in Eastern European butcher shops. Head cheese, of course, is anything that comes off a pig's head (and sometimes, what's inside, too), cooked down by long boiling into a jellied mass of scraps. It's scrumptious, partaking of the differential textures of ears, nose, cheek, and, yes, eyelids, running from soft and yielding to almost bony and back again. The above example comes from the sainted Sikorski Meat Market (603 Manhattan Avenue, Brooklyn,?718-389-6181) in Greenpoint, and you won't find a better head cheese in the five boroughs, unless you make it yourself. Speaking of make it yourself, my friend Winnie Yang has dabbled in head cheese in her own apartment, and here's?her blog entry to prove it. Dig the photo of the pig snoot sticking out of the pot!

What to 'B' to Ivo & Lulu
AUTHOR:
Chantal Martineau
DATE:
2009-04-7 14:28:00
POST:
Every week or so in 'What to B When You BYOB' we ask a local wine store to recommend a few good wines under $20 to pair with the food at a nearby BYOB restaurant. This week, we talk to Jim Kuhner of Vestry Wines (65 Vestry Street) about what to bring to Franco-Caribbean neighborhood favorite Ivo & Lulu (558 Broome Street) a few blocks away. NV Coteau du Pizy Touraine Sec Rose, Loire Valley, France ($15) This rosé sparkling is made from the pineau d'aunis grape, which is native to the Loire Valley. "Bright and focused red currant fruit with a hint of classic black pepper make this slightly off-dry sparkling the perfect aperitif and will enhance the shrimp with cilantro chili butter appetizer," says Jim. 2007 Shinn Estate Chardonnay, North Fork, Long Island ($16.50) "Not your oak-bomb chardonnay, Shinn manages to extract minerality and freshness from theirs (made with organic grapes), while using only neutral oak barrels to promote a luscious texture on the palate without the usual side of butter. There's plenty of snappy acidity here and essence of lemon zest to pair perfectly with the Poulet (roast chicken)." 2006 Huarpe Bonarda, Mendoza, Argentina ($10) "While malbec gets most of the attention in Argentina, bonarda is quietly flying under the radar. [It offers] up tremendous spicy black fruits, soft and mature tannins in a full-bodied wine, with a rich texture that will satisfy your craving for huge reds and pair brilliantly with the boar and sage sausages." 2006 Rosa del Golfo 'Scaliere' Negroamaro, Puglia, Italy ($14.50) "From the heel of the boot, Negroamaro translates as 'black and bitter,' but while the color may be deep, the flavors are more jubilant and ripe without a hint of bitterness. More red fruits emerge here like raspberry and red currant with a subtle aroma of thyme and rosemary that will bring out the ginger and carrot-miso sauce in the rabbit entrée." 2007 Guillot-Broux Macon-Cruzille, Burgundy, France ($17.50) Normally white wine country, the Maconnais mostly grows chardonnay, but around the village of Cruzille, there are a few old-vine plots of gamay planted that produce a gorgeous earthy and smoky red berry perfume with intense slate minerality on the palate. Not only a wine-geek wine, this (organic) red will bring out the richness of the venison paté and the purity of the duck magret."

The Early Word--Num Pang Cambodian Sandwiches
AUTHOR:
Sarah DiGregorio
DATE:
2009-04-7 14:23:00
POST:
The line for Num Pang on Tuesday afternoon--note the ramp and chicken liver special It's all sandwiches all the time around here these days. Three of the biggest Choice Eats hits were sandwiches: Porchetta, Baoguette and Sheep Station. Banh mi are suddenly breeding like bunnies. And Num Pang, the new Cambodian sandwich shop from the owners of Kampuchea, is off to a running start, with a line at the ordering window pretty much everyday. The sandwiches are similar to Vietnamese banh mi, in that they feature pickled carrots, cilantro, cucumber and mayo on a crusty roll, but the main fillings differ. Num Pang means "sandwich" in Khmer; the restaurant is single-minded in its eponymous devotion, offering six versions of the sandwich and nothing else to speak of. (Although the blood orange lemonade is very, very tart and refreshing.) The sandwiches are petite, about half the size of your average banh mi, and are made with wonderful semolina rolls from Parisi Bakery. The rolls are toasted slightly, slathered with chile mayo, pickled carrots, a slice of cucumber and a few sprigs of cilantro. Choose your filling: pulled pork, peppercorn catfish, coconut shrimp, hoisin veal meatballs, cauliflower-eggplant, or grilled skirt steak. Today, just to create even more foodie hysteria, there was also a ramp (zomg!) and chicken liver special sandwich. The sandwiches range from $6.75-$8.75--not Chinatown prices, obviously, but completely fair for the neighborhood, and the line moves quickly. Sandwich glamour shots, after the jump. Above: pulled duroc (that's a heritage hog breed) pork seasoned with spiced honey. The pork was very, very soft, pulled so thoroughly that it was more like pork rillette than pulled pork. I would have liked more texture to it, but the flavor was pretty great--sweet, rich and mild. Above: peppercorn catfish with sweet soy sauce. You'd think a fish fillet would be hard to pull off when you're making sandwiches at such a rapid pace, but this catfish was cooked nicely, with a sweet-peppery outer crust and a flaky, clean-tasting interior. Num Pang 21 East 12th Street 212-255-3271

POST:
Wine Enthusiast alum W.R. Tish has launched a new online publication that takes a cheeky approach to wine appreciation and its aficionados. The Dregs Report is like an Onion for oenophiles. [The Feed] Director of wine and spirits at B.R. Guest Restaurants Laura Maniec is now a Master Sommelier. As the 18th woman on the planet to hold the title, she's the youngest active MS alive and the only woman out of four maitres in New York City. [Eater] If you thought you were avoiding discolored teeth by drinking white wine instead of red, think again. An NYU study shows that the acidity in white wine can cause teeth to become more vulnerable to staining. [CNN] A study on women's attitudes toward wine commissioned by Bordeaux wine organization Vinexpo has found that, among other things, women drink wine because--shocker!--it tastes good. The study also found that women prefer red wine to both white and rosé, and consider wine to be part of a balanced diet. [Decanter] A British study suggests that drinking red wine helps you think. Grape skins contain a substance--also found in raspberries, blueberries, cranberries and peanuts--that causes blood vessels to widen, boosting the brain's blood supply. [Daily Mail] Dan Aykroyd will be in New Jersey tonight signing bottles of his new Crystal Head Vodka, which--you guessed it!--comes in a big glass skull. [PR Web]

Mayor Bloomberg's "nationwide initiative" to pressure the food industry to cut salt by half in the next ten years is intended to result in a healthier population, but no conclusive studies have told us how we would react to less salt in our diets. [NY Times] Meanwhile, Governor Paterson has declared "war on obesity," proposing to ban junk food in schools and limit cholesterol, sodium, fat, sugar and calories in cafeteria and vending machine foods. The new rules would not apply to bake sales. [Newsday] Liquid calories pack a bigger punch than their solid counterparts, according to a new study. Research showed that dieters were more successful when they cut out sugary drinks than when they cut solid food intake. [MSNBC] In other diet news, a Yale study shows that only about .001 of people who frequent fast-food joints check the available nutritional information, which is usually posted on the wall, in a pamphlet or on a special touch-screen computer.

Drinking Jeremiah Weed at Cornelius in Prospect Heights
AUTHOR:
Sarah DiGregorio

POST:
565 Vanderbilt in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn, used to house NooNa, a Korean restaurant that I really liked. Sadly, the restaurant closed a few months ago and now a whiskey bar called Cornelius has opened in the space. Another expensive cocktail bar is really the last thing anyone needs right now--and Cornelius is practically a carbon copy of all the others. There must be a fancy cocktail bar manual somewhere, in which you find out how to artfully distress your copper bar, and how to house-pickle. The bartender (who was very nice) was even wearing a fedora with a little feather on the brim. There are classic cocktails, including an old fashioned, a "perfect' Manhattan, and a negroni. And there are "Bartenders Choice" cocktails, which includes a steamboat--Makers Mark, maple syrup (from New Jersey) and sweet vermouth--and the Cornelius--Bluecoat gin, sage, clover honey and lime. The drinks run from $8-10. The small food menu features a charcuterie platter, house-pickled vegetables, pulled pork sliders, macaroni and cheese, and other trendster stuff. But Cornelius was also pouring Jeremiah Weed last night, a bourbon liqueur that is only rarely available in New York. (Six dollars for a generous pour.) Jeremiah Weed is made from sweetened Kentucky bourbon, and it's 100 proof. The viscous amber liquid tastes like honey, bourbon and fire. Apparently, Air Force fighter pilots do a shot of it after flights (for the possibly apocryphal story, check out this Facebook page). Unlike the fighter pilots, I actually think it tastes good, and should be drunk neat on a rainy night. Jeremiah Weed's website (a very odd site, with a very odd forum) has this to say: Get it while the getting's good. Cornelius 565 Vanderbilt Avenue, Brooklyn 718-398-6662

A Look at General Greene's Lunch Menu

POST:
 The beet salad, while morbidly beautiful, could use more salt and more horseradish (click if you dare) The General Greene began life last year as one of those short dishes?places,?predicated on cocktails and small plates of pork, offered with a kind of upbeat lunchroom decor. Though served only until 11 pm, the eats seemed late night by the standards of bucolic Ft. Greene. Unfortunately, the tapas-bar sector of the Brooklyn restaurant industry was already fizzling, and the General languished half empty most evenings. But then through a stroke of genius, the menu was expanded, and lunch added. In fact, there are three lunch menus currently available, including a breakfast menu served from 7 am till 4 pm (reflecting the fact that breakfast is the new culinary frontier), a lunch menu primarily of salads and sandwiches, and a restaurant week menu that provides two courses for two people for $23. Long may it wave. A friend and I dropped by last Friday around 1 pm to find the place pretty well filled up with knots of friends happily chatting, freelancers gazing into their laptops, and mothers with strollers dandling their infants. The place had turned into an afternoon hang. We particularly dug the toasted trout melt sandwich pictured above, which was oily and smoky and creamy. The pulled pork sandwich, pictured below and organized something like a Cuban sandwich, was a colossal disappointment, since the pork had been rendered into small crips shards that didn't seem much like pork. The biggest question, was why did the?plates arrive so unadorned? Even a diner puts a sprig of parsley on the plate. Despite our misgivings, there was no arguing that the General Greene had attracted a hopping lunchtime crowd. ?229 Dekalb Avenue, Ft. Greene, Brooklyn, 718-222-1510

On every table at Favela Cubana, stands a bottle of Companhia das Ervas Murupi Pepper Sauce, one of our favorite condiments. You don't have to go easy on this spicy, aromatic pepper sauce from Brazil--it has more flavor than heat. Made from Murupi peppers, which are native to the Amazonian rainforest, it also incorporates salt, vinegar, garlic, sugar and other spices. We like it drizzled pretty generously over fried plantain.

Meet the Maker--Manhattan Meadery's Nathaniel Martin
AUTHOR:
Chantal Martineau
DATE:
2009-04-6 14:02:00
POST:
Today we debut Meet the Maker, a recurring feature in which we meet a local food or drink producer, farmer or monger of some sort. Because everyone loves a monger. This week, we meet Nathaniel Martin, co-founder of Manhattan Meadery. Nathaniel (pictured left with a tank of his mead) and his brother, Thatcher, came up for the idea for their artisanal mead in their bric-à-brac-filled backyard. Their first product, Brooklyn Buzz, is available at such wine shops as Astor Wine and Spirits, Chelsea Wine Vault and Chambers Street Wine and Liquors, as well as at Perilla Restaurant, Abigail Café and Wine Bar and Spuyten Duyvil. What is mead and why have most people never tasted it? Mead is wine made from honey. A lot of historians and anthropologists believe that mead was probably one of the first fermented beverages. Imagine honey falling out of a beehive into a pool of water, spontaneously fermenting, man drinks the water and gets drunk. That could have been how alcohol got invented. There's been a long tradition of mead being more aristocratic than grape wine. It was expensive because there's only a fixed supply of honey in the world. These days, most mead is made at Renaissance fairs and by Middle Ages enthusiasts and not by real winemakers. So, most of what's out there isn't that good. How did you start making it? My brother and I are both really into DIY. My parents always made jams and pickles, and our house is like a horticulturist's dream. I've always been interested in tinkering and building stuff. In college, I was building bars and tap systems for all the fraternity houses, and started brewing beer and making wine in my backyard. From there, I just started to experiment with different flavors and eventually started doing beer with honey, then started making meads. And it tasted good. But still have a day job? Making mead in small batches is really expensive. As a day job, I work as an environmental insurance underwriter. So, part of the motivation for starting [Manhattan Meadery] was to create a local, sustainable product. If it's like wine, are the bees important to the final product in the same way grapes are? Yes. Most honeymakers make their money from shipping their bees all over the country for breeding contracts and the honey is actually just a byproduct of their business. We chose a beekeeper from the Finger Lakes, who only makes a living making artisanal honey and sells his products in the Greenmarket in Union Square. He doesn't ship his bees all over the place and hasn't lost any hives to colony collapse disorder, which is a sickness that arises from the bees being stressed. He has pretty happy, healthy bees. How is your first product, Brooklyn Buzz, best enjoyed? I think it drinks more like a wine. We wanted to give people something new and different that they haven't tried before. In terms of residual sugar, flavor and body characteristics, it's very wine-like. It's sold in a wine bottle and should be served in a white wine glass. It has a lot of acidity, flavor and is very aromatic. It's very good with pastas and chicken and other lighter fare. Some people enjoy it as a dessert wine even though it's not super sweet. It pairs well with sweeter and saltier foods, like hard cheeses. Perilla is actually cooking with it. I hear they cook bacon with it and do a quail in a mead jus. It's pretty great to enjoy outside on a warm day. What's next for Manhattan Meadery? I'd love to make cyster. Whenever you mix mead with something else, it has a different name. Cyster is apples and mead. I want to make a sparkling cyster and put it in champagne bottles. The first product was Brooklyn Buzz--maybe we'd do a whole tour of the city and call it something like Queen's Bee.

Finlandia Mails Out Peel 'n Lick Samples of Upcoming Tangerine Fusion
AUTHOR:
Chantal Martineau
DATE:
2009-04-6 13:52:00
POST:
On the heels of the Absolut Mango launch, Finlandia has already started gearing up for its new Tangerine Fusion flavor expected to drop in May. The flavored vodka will be available exclusively in duty free shops and is the latest in Finlandia's line of fruit-flavored vodkas, which includes lime, mango and grapefruit. Spotted in our mailbox: a peel 'n lick sample of the new Finlandia Tangerine Fusion, something like a Listerine tab of orangy vodka flavor but containing no alcohol. Move over Scratch 'n Sniff! This new marketing strategy is being pioneered by First Flavor, whose slogan "Marketing with taste" has won over such brands as Campbell's, Welch's and Skyy. Like its odorous predecessor, the technology is more of a gimmick than a real way to sample new products. The Finlandia Tangerine Fusion tab tasted like chewable Flintstone's vitamin C and we can only imagine what a tab of Campbell's soup might taste like. But it's a fun little surprise to get in the mail and a more cost-effective solution that sending out actual samples of a product. Simply peel, place the tab on your tongue and let it dissolve (and use your imagination). The "flavor rendition" is scientifically engineered, using such ingredients as hydrolyzed cellulose gum, glycerin, citric acid, pullulan, carboxymethyl cellulose, polysorbate 65 and 80 and sucralose, most of which you will not find in the vodka itself.

Foraging For Free Food--Garlic Chives in Prospect Park
AUTHOR:
Robert Sietsema

2009-04-6 9:32:00
POST:
 Disembark the Q train at the Parkside stop, wander through the triumphal gate one block west at Ocean Avenue, and then head north along the paved walkway past the muddy picnic grounds. All around you find a wonderland of wild allium, sticking up in distinctive clumps. There are grass tuffets, too, but the allium stalks have a rounder appearance, and when you pick a stalk and gingerly taste it, it will have a fresh, oniony savor. Clumps of chives are visible all across this field The allium, or onion family, falls into many wild varieties, and during the early spring several of theses are to be found in Prospect Park, especially at this location. Fork in the Road found delicate regular chives, sturdier and more odiferous garlic chives, and even wild scallions, all of which are wonderful tossed in salads, lightly sauteed and used in omelets, chopped and sprinkled on tacos, or melted into a toasted cheese sandwich. Distinguishing among the wild allium is up to you--simply nip off a stalk and taste it. Sometimes you'll even find wild garlic, which has a small bulb at the end of the green stalk when you extract it carefully from the muddy ground. Wild scallions vs. wild chives, against a newspaper backdrop

Strange Snacks of the World--Chakli

POST:
Behold the hypnotically delicious chakli--the tastiest cracker I know of. These spiral fried snacks (also called murukku) from India are made from a mix of rice and/or besan (chickpea) flour, very heavily spiced with chile powder, turmeric, sesame seeds, cumin, ajwain, asafoetida, enriched with ghee to make a batter, and then extruded into the bubbling oil. Many families make chakli at home for Diwali, but buy them at stores the rest of the year, to crunch on with tea. You can find them at most Indian groceries, or check out the many varieties at Patel Brothers.

Last week, a fried chicken joint in Brownsville, Brooklyn, changed its name from Royal Fried Chicken to Obama Fried Chicken, a name some find inappropriate or even racist. It's true that fried chicken spots with grandiose presidential names are not unheard of--think of all those Kennedy Fried Chickens!--but the juxtaposition of an African American president and fried chicken touches a nerve. The owner is a recent immigrant from Bangladesh, who likely doesn't know the loaded historical context that he's stirred up--and who might represent a change in neighborhood demographics that complicates feelings even more. Because of the uproar, the owner says he'll soon change the name again, this time to Popular Fried Chicken. [New York Times]

One More Reason For Food Critics to be Anonymous

Steve Barnes, the restaurant critic for the Albany Times Union, was attacked outside a restaurant last October. That day, Barnes (whose head shot adorns his blog) had posted his plans be at the restaurant that night. Unfortunately, this terrifying guy to the left (photo courtesy of the Albany Times Union), who is a mixed martial arts fighter named Jerry Spiegel, showed up as well, and he assaulted Barnes and a friend. Now, police say that they're investigating possible ties between Spiegel and a restaurant that Barnes wrote about last year. The obvious implication is that Barnes wrote a negative review about a restaurant to which Spiegel is somehow connected. Yowza. [Times Union via Gawker]

Peanut Board Funds Subway Ads; Food Safety Regs Remain Unsatisfactory
AUTHOR:
Chantal Martineau
DATE:
2009-04-3 15:35:00
POST:
Spotted on the D train: one of the National Peanut Board's ads bearing its new slogan, "Peanuts: Energy for the Good Life." The ad could be for cell phones or anti-depression medication. It depicts a young man in a suit slumped on what appears to be a New York subway bench, clutching his phone as he supposedly struggles with the dilemma of whether or not to phone his love interest. Peanuts, it says, give you "energy to make up your mind." The crisis-management ad campaign was a top priority for the NPB and the peanut farmers it represents, whose industry was slammed after salmonella-tainted peanut products caused the biggest food product recall in US history, killing 9 people and sickening some 1,400. But a disturbing piece in The Washington Post today reveals that no real changes have been made to the way peanut facilities are inspected since the recall. The NPB says it's mission is not only to promote but also to conduct research within its industry. It's the FDA's job to safeguard peanut plants, but let's hope the NPB isn't spending all its cash on campaigning. If it doesn't apply more pressure onto the FDA to overhaul food safety inspection practices, it'll take more than subway ads to turn us back on to those little legumes.

The Cider Scene at Flatbush Farm

POST:
Flatbush Farm's Basque Cider Festival last night featured plates of Basque peppers and Idiazábal cheese. The cider itself--Sarasola Sagardoa, with its razor sharp acidity and yeasty funk--was poured as it should be: from high overhead into a glass held at waist level, which stimulates the bubbles and awakens the flavors. Viva la sidra!

I, Locavore--Awesome Deal on Local Chardonnay
AUTHOR:

POST:
The crisp chardonnay of Millbrook Vineyards and Winery (click to taste) As a wine enthusiast, you're no doubt familar with the reasonably priced and often good wines of the North Fork of Long Island, and the pricier product of New York's pristine Finger Lakes region. But a lesser known wine region centers on the?Hudson River Valley running from north of Nyack to south of Albany, on both the east and west sides of the great river. One of the distinguished winemakers of this region is Millbrook Vineyards and Winery, which is east of the river northeast of Poughkeepsie, just outside the town of MIllbrook, in real Rip Van Winkle country. This chardonnay contrasts nicely with the specimens found in California--crisper, drier, and slightly less complex, with a pale straw color, a perfect wine for picnics that doesn't overwhelm the food. The usual price at Astor Wines and Spirits is $11.99, but a current sale (with your Astor discount card--sign up for one now, it's free) delivers the bottle to you for $10.49, which is an excellent deal, and a chance to drink locally. 399 Lafayette Street, 212-674-7500

Wine Tweeter and vlogger Gary Vaynerchuk has signed a seven-figure 10-book deal with HarperStudio. The Belarusian-born wine retailer from New Jersey, who has 145,000 followers on Twitter, admits he doesn't read books. [Wall Street Journal] A Japanese study suggests that chicken soup may help lower blood pressure. Chicken legs and feet, often discarded as waste products in the US but used as soup ingredients elsewhere, are a source of collagen proteins that can act as ACE inhibitors. [UPI] Two new studies show that foods rich in antioxidants, such as green tea, may lose some of their health benefits when stored too long. Antioxidant activity was shown to drop significantly within the first six months of storage. [USA Today] In an effort to encourage people to drink more at home during tough economic times, spirits companies are launching pre-mixed products, such as Sauza tequila Margarita-in-a-Box and Southern Comfort Sweet Tea. [Wall Street Journal] Hotelier Andre Balazs of The Mercer, The Raleigh and Chateau Marmont fame, was spotted making out with Guinness stout heiress Daphne Guinness at the Balthazar dinner for the new Topshop opening Wednesday night.

Hot Doug's is the darling of Chicago's hot dog scene, an untraditional purveryor of tube steaks in a town whose main squeeze, dog--wise, is an intensely red, artificially colored, Vienna Red Hots frank with a catalog of pile-ons that even I can't remember, and I'm stone cold sober right now. (Let's see, dill pickle spear, "sports" peppers, cyanide-green pickle relish, grainy mustard, onion, and tomato. What did I forget?) Anyway, hot dogger Doug Sohn set tongues wagging by offering a minimalist John Cage frank, as reported by the Chicago food blog LTHForum (via www.thedailyswarm.com): John Cage Hot Dog In a town ruled by Grant Achatz, was it an April Fools hoax, or an arcane stroke of culinary genius?

Veggie Converts Now Meat Missionaries
AUTHOR:
Chantal Martineau
DATE:
2009-04-2 14:08:00
POST:
Gourmet has an interesting piece on vegetarians-turned-butchers, people who formerly shunned meat and now not only make a living selling it but also try to be forces for education and change in the industry. As former veggies, these converts are able to sympathize with those who have rejected the meat industry, but rather than promote not eating meat, they encourage people to support small, sustainable and local farms. After all, eating vegetarian, like eating organic, does not translate into eating healthfully or even ethically, as many vegetarian foods are processed or transported across the country (i.e., Tofurky is from Oregon). But eating meat from small, local and sustainable farms can ensure knowing how the animal was raised and killed. And for conscientious eaters, omnivorous or not, these are the questions that should drive our foods choices. [Gourmet]

Charles in Charge -- Revisited

POST:
Regular shipments of bottled water and booze find their way into the not-yet-officially-open restaurant Charles (click to chug a few bottles) ? ? ? ? ? Early in October, Eater reported on a pre-opening dinner at a new restaurant at 234?West 4th?Street (at?W. 10th?Street), which had previously been home to Les Deux Gamins, once the flagship of a mighty fleet. The new restaurant was called Charles, and the?consulting chef was to be John DeLucie of the Waverly Inn. Fair enough -- a clone of the Inn just?a few blocks away, and another place destined to be parked up with idling limos all evening. Well, I got news for everyone. Even though the windows remain papered over,?crowds have been standing outside the front door?every?evening sucking furtively on cigs for the last few months, while regular shipments of booze and bottled water made their way down the basement hatchway, as evidenced by the above picture. I assumed the place was being operated semi-legally as a sort of speakeasy, and kept my mouth shut. Then a friend--after seeing the original of this post earlier today--emailed me to let me know the place has been operating as a fully licensed restaurant?all along, while keeping the windows paperered up, as if the place is perpertually not yet open. This is?presumably?done to discourage the likes of you and me from trying to eat there. Fine with me, assholes! I promise never to eat in your restaurant. Meanwhile, the boarded up place is a neighborhood eyesore, with the tattered remains of the awning from the previous establishment flapping in the breeze, and the window boxes broken and unmended.

This is such a great blog. I could not agree more. We live across the street. I really miss Les Deux Gamins. There's a great book out there called Influence by Robert Cialdini. He discusses six weapons of influence. One is scarcity (perceived scarcity will generate demand. For example, saying offers are available for a "limited time only" encourages sales). These chumps are obviously trying to exploit "scarcity." It's silly, but I am sure plenty of morons will get sucked in.

I live very close. This is the opposite of what the village used to be (and I still hope to believe) is about. It's a community, first and foremost. A neighborhood that was built on inclusion of all different types of people. Not a mall or playground for those who now deem it 'safe and clean enough' to turn into a downtown version of Uptown. I consider myself a bit of trendy little yuppy fashionista as much as the next person, even though have lived here for about 12 years. I find myself in chic places like this every once in a while. But I'm not sSO full of myself that I would even bring myself to patronize a place that's more concerned about their pretentiousness than they are about their neighbors.

I too live in the neighborhood, and think this restaurant's idiotic "design" destroys the character of what was previously a picturesque and iconic corner. It's amazing this design was not subject to some kind of architectural review board approval process. I only hope that others feel the same way -- perhaps the neighborhood can get together and start a protest or petition, maybe get it in front of CB2.

Are you thinking of Pho Bac on Broadway in the strip mall that has a Singas? Theirs is OK, but like all restaurant banh mi, it pales in comparison to those made by folks whose primary focus is banh mi. Last time I checked it was tasty, but didn't have any crunchy roast pork. It was more of a cold-cut hero with a slight Vietnamese accent. If there's another one in Queens that's better please let me know!

Photo borrowed from PSFK Fashion junkies will be flocking to Topshop in droves today as the British chain opens its first US outpost right here in New York. Pinkberry will be on hand to dole out free samples at the door. Down the street, Vitamin Water is opening a new pop-up store to promote its new low-cal beverages. Don't forget, though, that 10 calories per serving means 25 per bottle as there are 2.5 8-oz servings in each 20-oz bottle. Sneaky, huh?

Terrance Brennan of Picholine and Artisanal plans to take over a struggling Trigo and turn it into Bar Artisanal. Expect bistro fare and a retail component selling olive oil, cheese and charcuterie. [NY Times] Paul Liebrandt is the only New York chef on Food & Wine's list of 2009 Best New Chefs. Other winners included Naomi Pomeroy of Beast in Portland, as well as Jon Shook and Vinny Dotolo from Animal in Los Angeles. [Grub Street] New York gets a little more love from Saveur in its list of "12 Restaurants that Matter." Dan Barber's Blue Hill at Stone Barns is cited, as are Andrew Tarlow and Mark Firth's Marlow & Sons and Danny Meyer's Gramercy Tavern. [NY Post] Top Chefs Leah Cohen and winner Hosea Rosenberg were spotted smooching last Saturday night as they watched "Fuerza Bruta" together. [NY Post] Cohen's mouth was also busy trashing her ex-boss at Centro Vinoteca, Anne Burrell, this week during an interview with Decider. "[Burrell] was never here toward the end," said Cohen. "She wanted to pursue her career on television, which isn't my style." Really? [Decider]

A tripe top? A tongue tie? Why not, says photographer Stephanie Diani, who claims that "Meat as fashion must be in the collective unconscious." After all, it's all just flesh on flesh. Her photographs are taken in classic portrait style and truly are beautiful if you can get past the idea of wearing raw organ tissue. Diani wanted to explore the relationships between "fashion and distaste." As more of us take up the nose-to-tail philosophy of eating, we're embarking on a parallel journey of discovery: the tastes, textures and even idea of things like tongue, glands and brains can inspire varying reactions, from salivation to revulsion. And sometimes both at once. [Eat me Daily]

 Oh boy! A new candy bar named after an iconic Japanese dormant volcano (click to erupt). Note that the Lafayette stop on the C has also been inadvertently renamed. Am I the only one annoyed by the relentless advertising campaign being waged in entire subway cars and on subway billboards by the totally sub-par Snickers candy empire? Yes I know it was invented in 1930, named after a horse, and represents the largest selling candy bar in the world. And yes, I instantly recognized the shape of the faux logo and the lettering, and knew just what they were talking about. But even as a kid I knew that Snickers was an inferior product to be abhorred, especially when tossed in its "fun size" into Halloween goody bags. Peanuts are not nuts! I want almonds or filberts in my candy bar! And perhaps the same seething brains that thought up the inferior puns we are now being pelted with also came up with this homophobic half-time commercial:

I hated these ads from the first moment I saw them. Chewniversity being the one that first caused me to hold back the vomit erupting from my turned stomach. These, and the, brightly colored, nonsensical (pop pop pop), Pepsi campaign both have me considering the effect that television and the internet are having on us. We no longer need to be fed information about the product. We just need bright colors and nonsense words to remind us that these products exist. Then our reptile brains fill in the rest of the info. "Mmm...products."

Last night's Choice Eats tasting event went off smashingly, if we don't say so ourselves. Yes, it was crowded, but that's unavoidable given the allure of tasting food from 56 restaurants, representing 37 different cuisines. These restaurants are scattered across all five boroughs, so having them all in one place was a thrill. Plus, there was plenty of booze. Here's a look at what others thought.Serious Eats thought the crowd was nuts, but liked Baoguette's banh mi and Cafe Glechik's dessertsMidtown Lunch laments the fact that Margon Restaurant was the only midtown respresentative, also enjoys Cheburechnaya and Tortilleria NixtamalJoe DiStefano, writing for The Feedbag, loved Sheep Station's lamb sandwich, Porchetta's porchetta and Dirt Candy's portobello mousseShelbs and Cheese has a comprehensive run-down, including hits and misses. Big miss: Mama's Food Shop's mac and cheese. Big hit: Dirt Candy's portobello mousse. Kathy at A Passion for Food reportedly got around to every one of the 56 tables! She liked Peaches Market's short ribs with grits and No. 7's vanilla pudding with miso bananas. Blondie and Brownie loved Motorino's bomblonis and Kampuchea's five-spice chicken wings

Babbo Shuttered!

POST:
Greenwich Village stalwart Babbo was closed by the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene in an unusual late-night raid. The bar crowd and a handful of patrons still dining were swept out onto the sidewalk around midnight as the chef, his signature orange clogs slapping on the pavement, was led to a waiting squad car. "Gee, he looks so thin," one passerby noted, "Maybe he had his stomach stapled." "We found human meat in the walk-in freezer," said a shaken inspector. "What they were serving all day as lamb chops scottadita was really just Scott."

Photo by VirtualErn @ Flickr Foodie websites and applications have already been launched to help you eat healthy and locally, and trace your food items back to their sources. The latest tech tool for foodies is StillTasty.com, a website devoted entirely to the shelf life of food. Left pizza out overnight? Concerned about how best to defrost a whole fish? And what of the age-old question: ketchup, to chill or not to chill? Get the answers to these and a plethora of other questions relating to how long foods last and when they should be trashed. Nifty, but it won't save you from the endless stream of salmonella outbreaks.

This week in the Voice, Robert Sietsema visit 10 Downing, where the chicken for two is the perfect date dish, while Sarah DiGregorio drops in on Butcher Bay for lobster pot pie. Bruni goes to Macau Trading Co., where he is taken aback by the erotic décor in the basement. He awards it just one star, citing overcooked lobster, yet praising the "plump and meaty" chicken dumplings [NY Times] TONY gives Center Cut three stars for its classic steakhouse recipes and organic, sustainable meat and seafood suppliers. The resto gets extra points for the tableside flambé cart serving up "formidable" cherries jubilee. [TONY] Restaurant Girl wears jeans to Le Cirque's lounge, where Chef Craig Hopson (formerly of One if By Land and Picholine) manages to mess up fried calamari and lobster consommé, but still gets three stars for his braised veal pavé, and duck and green mango salad. [NY Daily News] Adam Platt visits Bar Breton and Txikito, awarding each just one star. Bar Breton's galettes are "appealing enough," but the entrées are spotty. Txikito serves up good simple Basque tapas, but fails on more exotic dishes. [NY Magazine]

We like to pride ourselves on how progressive New York is, but a recent study shows that upscale restaurants prefer to hire white male wait staff. Applicants with similar resumes were sent out to apply for jobs over the course of a year; whites were twice as likely to get hired. [Reuters] Scientists are trying to improve the taste of food for cancer patients following a new study that shows chemotherapy and radiotherapy can damage the senses of taste and smell, which can lead to malnutrition, and even morbidity. [Science Daily] Bankers are no longer welcome at Soho House, according to operations director Mark Somen, who claims the club will not renew certain memberships this year as it wishes to return to its "artsy" roots. [NY Post] Jelly (Jell-O for Americans) was once regarded as the "pinnacle of sophistication," say two jelly artists who are trying to revive gelatin's panache with their elaborate jelly models, such as London's St. Paul's Cathedral and Millennium Bridge. [NY Times] Newsday takes a look back at salmonella and E. coli outbreaks of the past few years, from bagged spinach in 2006 to peanut butter late last year. [Newsday]
