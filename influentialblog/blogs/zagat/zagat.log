Featuring food from the likes of Adour, Daniel, Le Bernardin, Momofuku Ssäm Bar, Per Se and Sueños, the event will also feature an open bar, live music and a silent auction.

A Rao's-ing Tale

***CONTENT
Rao's Las Vegas Photo: courtesy of the restaurant For those of us who grew up in New York, Rao’s was the Holy Grail of Italian cuisine. Unlike the Holy Grail, we knew where to find it – at the corner of 114th and Pleasant Avenue in East Harlem. But like the Cup of Christ, we could never actually grasp it. It didn't matter who you were – you couldn't get in. To this day, its 10 tables are booked every night by regulars, who get the table for the evening. You can call, you can beg, you can plead. But you can't get in. For more than a century, the descendants of founder Charles Rao have resisted the urge to replicate. Then, in 2006, they announced they were opening an outpost in Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, a move that sent shock waves throughout the restaurant industry. And the Rao's buzz shows no signs of cooling: recently it was announced that its signature wines would be sold at select Whole Foods. So why did Rao's open a branch after more than 100 years of solitude? And are there any other plans to expand the brand? Sitting at a table on the front patio of the Vegas branch, co-owner Frank Pellegrino Jr. explained: Merrill Shindler: So... why expand? And why here? Frank Pellegrino Jr.: It was never a priority to open another branch. But Caesars impressed us with their foresight, their understanding and their level of communication. It was a perfect fit. There isn't another hotel in Las Vegas where we would have done this. This is the only place. MS: What were the non-negotiables? FP: If it wasn't Rao's, the real Rao's, it wasn't going to happen. It had to be every bit of Rao's. There was never any doubt that we wanted to re-create the restaurant, booth by booth, picture by picture, dish by dish. When we agreed on that, we felt ready to move forward. MS: Is it true you hired Engstrom Design to actually survey the original restaurant? FP: They measured every inch of Rao's in East Harlem. They got to understand the nuances of the restaurant. Every detail was paid attention to, nothing was left out. When I look at the photos people have taken in Rao's Las Vegas, I would swear they were taken in New York. It's not as if we were trying to build the Sistine Chapel. But there are complexities that most people wouldn't notice. We would – we did this for ourselves. You can't just build it. Everyone involved with this project is in love with Rao's, the passion, the heart, the soul. It's not about money. It's about what Rao's means to the people who go to Rao's. This is a restaurant like none other. We don't want people to just leave full. We want people to leave fulfilled. MS: There must be some differences. I mean, the Las Vegas Rao's is inside a casino. And where New York seats 40 people, Las Vegas seats 200 – with a bar where you can eat as well. FP: Because of Clark County codes, the rooms are a little bit wider. [The original] Rao's is 113 years old, so it doesn’t meet a lot of today's regulations. But the variance is small. Most people wouldn't notice. It’s the same exact ceiling we have at Rao's. Even the paint is the same, the same textures and color scheme as in New York. The colors are old colors. We wanted the place to feel as if it had been here – maybe not 113 years, maybe 100 years. MS: That is so not Las Vegas. I mean, this is the very epicenter of the Shock of the New. FP: Everybody took their cues from 114th and Pleasant. There was nothing that couldn't be replicated. The people at Thor Construction, who do the building for Caesars, really understood. The folks who did the mill work, they relished this project. It's a throwback to the old days, not what people do anymore. They'd tell us that this was how their fathers and grandfathers did it. There was a pride in what they did that was beautiful. Craftsmen never have a chance to do work like this anymore. MS: Replicating the room is one thing. But what about the food? I mean, you're a continent away from your suppliers. FP: Usually when you do things in mass, the quality changes. Chef Carla keeps the integrity, so everything tastes as if it were made in small kitchen by someone's grandmother. And it should – we're using all the original recipes. This is the same menu, there's nothing that didn't travel. We overnight whatever we need. If there are any tomatoes left in the San Marzano region, we get them. MS: You've now been in Las Vegas for two and a half years. Anything you want to change? FP: After two and a half years, it feels like home. Honestly, we wouldn't want to change a thing. We have everything we want, everything in the kitchen, everything that reflects Rao's in New York. MS: Do people's appetites differ between East and West? FP: It's remarkable, but people in New York and Las Vegas order the same food. The same meatballs, penne alla vodka, veal chops with hot and sweet cherry peppers, steak pizzaiola, veal parmesan. Really, the restaurants mirror one another. MS: And how's the outdoor bocce court doing? FP: We all play bocce here. We just opened a Bocce Bar next to the bocce court. And we've hired Bocce Bellas who come out in bikinis and teach people how to play bocce. MS: Bikinis? You don't do that on 114th Street. FP: It's Las Vegas, so the teachers are in bikinis. You can have a cocktail at the bocce court, and the Bocce Bellas referee the games. So, yes, that's different. MS: How has the recession affected you? FP: We've built solid relationships with a lot of people, a lot of regular customers. The recession has touched us, but only slightly. We're going very strong. We've streamlined things, so we're doing very well. It hasn't impacted us that much. At least, not yet. If it ever will. MS: For those who can't get to Rao's, you also have a line of products. Any plans for Rao's Frozen Italian Dinners? FP: We have pasta sauces, pasta, olive oil, vinegar, peppers. We just introduced three domestic wines. Frozen – you never know, we've looked into it. MS: And is this the beginning of a chain? Maybe another branch in a century or so? FP: We're very comfortable with where we are right now. We want to enjoy this experience. We don't rush anything. It's been 113 years, we're in no hurry. We've dreamed of a pizzeria – who hasn't. We served pizza when we did lunch the first year we opened. But right now we have to deal with a new generation of Rao's regulars. We've had a lot of people who haven't been able to get in. But it's easier. Here, you have to wait a few weeks; back East, you have to wait a lifetime. – Merrill Shindler

Chewing the Fat With Stanley Lobel

***CONTENT
Stanley Lobel Photo: courtesy of Lobel's Prime Meats Renowned butcher Stanley Lobel, whose family has been in the industry for five generations, knows meat. As co-owner and operator of the Upper East Side institution Lobel's Prime Meats, and co-author of the recently published Lobel’s Meat Bible, he is one of the most trusted authorities on the subject, with his store attracting a loyal following among celebrities, politicians and devoted foodies alike. Having already illustrated that steak is still prime, we spoke to Lobel about why it deserves to be, and asked him to share some trade secrets and opinions on current trends. Zagat Buzz: What makes for a good steak? Stanley Lobel: A really great steak is not very soft. A really great steak has a combination of softness and flavor – flavor is critical. Cook it with a little kosher salt, olive oil and that’s it. ZB: So when you want steak, where do you go? SL: To my house. Although I do have one restaurant that allows me to bring my own, the only catch is that I’ve got to bring one for the owner! ZB: How are your clients dealing with the recession? SL: I thank god I’ve felt nothing in terms of the recession. We’re very fortunate. I guess maybe our clients are just well-heeled, and I think a lot of them would rather have a good steak rather than a good stock...I know the way I feel – when I want something, and I figure how much money I’ve lost, I’ve got to be crazy not to have what I want. If I wait, I may not be here, or I may not want it anymore! ZB: Many restaurants seem to be hosting whole animal roasts. What's your opinion of this trend? SL: The whole purpose of cooking that way is because of economics. It’s much more reasonable to cook larger sides of beef with slow cooking, which enables the meat to become soft and tender...I think once the average person gets that taste, whole roasts are here to stay. ZB: Is there a cut of meat from the past you’d like to see more of on modern menus? SL: The old-fashioned pot roast is a cut of meat that comes from the first cut chuck. It has enormous flavor, and is not being used in restaurants at all. The average cut they use now is bottom round, eye round, top round and brisket – those are the normal cuts and are flavorless. But when you take this specific cut that I’m talking about and pot it, it’s not good – it’s magnificent. ZB: And there’s no place where can you order such a thing? SL: Nope. One of the biggest problems I find with the food industry today is that you can take any piece of meat and mask it, and make it look good and make it taste good. But when you start with the right piece of meat, it doesn’t just taste good, it tastes incredibly good, like something you’ve never eaten before. ZB: What cuts of meat would you recommend to convert a vegetarian to meat? SL: I’d have them over to my house, and I’d barbecue. Grilled steak is by far the best. It’d be either a rib steak, which is extremely flavorful, or a hanger steak, which is also incredibly flavorful and extremely juicy. ZB: Conversely, what would you suggest for a person who feels they’ve had it all? SL: Rabbi, priest? [Laughs.] For the person who wants to be a connoisseur, I’d have to go with a filet, a prime grilled filet. Filet is soft, normally speaking, and doesn’t have the flavor that a real steak has, but when you use a prime filet, it has the combination of the flavor and the softness, and makes an incredible steak. But it must be prime. ZB: How do you feel about the public being more involved in finding out where they get their meat? SL: I think it’s incredibly important. With what we do, everything comes from a special farm that produces for us. But unfortunately not everyone has the ability to get that kind of product. There’s a lot to be done in that area. ZB: What’s one thing that we can improve on when purchasing meat for home preparation? Any widespread mistakes? SL: If I go into a supermarket, or go into a Costco, Sam’s Club or a BJ’s, I have a tendency to watch what people do and how they buy. And what they look for is bright red meat, and it just surprises me how they don’t understand that meat needs graining – those little flecks of fat in the meat to make it soft, which is not the fat culprit. The fat culprit is fat that’s on the outside, not the fat that’s in the inside. So the most [common] mistake that people make is not knowing what they’re buying. But then again, that’s why we just came out with our new book, Lobel’s Meat Bible. ZB: For your money, what’s a good cut of meat to get? SL: If I was a consumer and needed to cut back, the way I’d cut back would be in quantity, not quality. I’d rather have one steak once a week, and have the best, than a lot of steak during the week that’s just food going down your stomach. That would be my preference, no two ways about it! – Jacqueline Wasilczyk

Tavern on the Green has had a rough week of it. Yesterday the New York Post reported that when the deadline to bid on a 20-year lease for the landmark arrived, few buyers stepped up to the plate. Among the “thanks, but no thanks” crowd were Danny Meyer, Donald Trump and the Ciprianis. Adding insult to injury, today the Post claims that Tavern boss Jennifer LeRoy and her mother, Kay, are being sued by Workman Publishing for refusing to make good on a promise to buy 10,000 copies of their own book, Tavern on the Green. At this rate, Tavern in Blue might be a more apt title.

But before he leaves, those looking to try the chef's French–New American cuisine – which put Per Se on the top of our Food list – might want to book a spot at one of the restaurant's new series of wine dinners, “The American Table at Per Se.” Each evening kicks off with a 6:30 PM reception, followed by a 7 PM meal uniquely crafted to match the wines of a notable vintner, who will lead a presentation about each selection. The first event, May 28, features Copain Wine Cellars; June 11 showcases Brewer-Clifton, Melville Winery and Diatom Wines; and June 22 highlights the Scholium Project, which produces wines in Red Hook, Brooklyn, among other places ($325 per person, plus tax; 212-823-9349).

The Deets on DBGB

***CONTENT
At Saturday’s media preview of DBGB Kitchen & Bar, chef-owner Daniel Boulud went out of his way to stress that, despite early rumors, the restaurant is not a burger place. But with three burgers slated for its menu, including \"The Piggie,\" topped with Daisy May's pulled BBQ pork, it doesn't seem like burger-philes will be disappointed when the venture launches in June. DBGB (“Daniel Boulud’s Giant Balls,” the chef joked) is indeed a Pan-European brasserie, offering everything from shellfish platters and crispy tablier de sapeur squares, to a roving ice cream sundae cart – washed down by a planned 22 draft beers (plus 20–30 bottles) and a far-reaching wine list, all selected by wine director Colin Alevras (ex Tasting Room). But the real stars of the show, as discussed by Boulud in the video above, are the 14 varieties of housemade sausage – think merguez served over chickpeas with lemon and braised spinach and a “Boudin Basque,” spicy blood sausage alongside mashed potatoes. Though prices are still being finalized, expect appetizers starting at $7 and mains at $11 (check out the full preliminary menu here). As for the space, Design Bureaux incorporated the Bowery’s legacy as a hub for kitchen-supply stores, warming up the industrial, minimalist setting with wooden shelving (through which the open kitchen, a Boulud first, can be seen) and pots donated by other famous chefs including Anthony Bourdain. For further reading on DBGB's development process, check out this article in the Times (299 Bowery; 212-933-5300).

Who were the big winners? Once again, Xaviars at Piermont placed No.1 in both Food and Service, while another of chef Peter Kelly’s restaurants, X2O Xaviars on the Hudson, was voted Most Popular. The “magnificent” views at Tarrytown’s Equus helped it gallop to the top of the Decor list. Finally, 36 Main in New Paltz was surveyors’ favorite newcomer in the area.

Kuma Inn Photo: courtesy of the restaurant Kuma Inn, the ever-popular Filipino-Thai Lower East Sider, can hardly contain itself. Once a tiny hideaway for adventurous foodies, it now rarely has an empty seat at prime time. So the small-plates purveyor has decided to branch out to Brooklyn, with an offshoot slated to open in Clinton Hill (433 DeKalb Ave.) sometime this spring. With the restaurant’s growing popularity, high Food score (24) and relatively low prices, it seems a good bet that its Brooklyn brother will succeed. But if we look to history as a guide, the equation for cross-borough restaurant success is a bit more complicated. Traditionally, Manhattan-to-Brooklyn expansions seem to have a higher success rate as a whole. Just ask the Bromberg brothers, who have extended their Blue Ribbon empire from its SoHo flagship in Manhattan to include two Park Slope restaurants and a gig providing the food for the upcoming Brooklyn Bowl in Williamsburg. Even with their Manhattan-like price tags, the Park Slope Blue Ribbons seem to be doing A-ok. Other Manhattan transfers that are hanging in there include Cube 63, Caracas Arepas Bar, SEA and Dallas BBQ. Frankies Spuntino LES Photo: Noah Kalina It’s when restaurants cross in the other direction that things can get tricky. Though Frankies Spuntino effortlessly made the leap from Carroll Gardens to the Lower East Side, the same wasn’t true for Lunetta. When the popular Boerum Hill Italian opened a branch in the Flatiron, many a food columnist predicted its inevitable success. They were wrong – the Manhattan Lunetta closed just 15 months after its debut. So, given the path of its migration, Brooklyn Kuma should be moving in the right direction. But perhaps it has less to do with direction than with the similarity of the original neighborhood and the expansion destination. Maybe the Manhattan-nostalgic Park Slope stroller set was itching for something fancier like a Blue Ribbon. Conversely, Williamsburg-ers tend to love cheap eats, which could explain why Caracas is doing well. And perhaps the LES is a better match for reasonable Italian small plates than the Flatiron. Only time will tell if Clinton Hillers are as hungry for sweet and spicy Chinese sausage as Lower East Siders. Kuma chef-owner King Phojanakong, born and raised in Manhattan, is optimistic. “I think it will be a welcome addition to the block that is currently limited to a 99-cent store and a fried chicken joint.” King cites “rent feasibility” as a reason for the outer-borough move. But maybe the most pressing question for bridge-crossing foodies is why hasn’t hipster-friendly David Chang given Brooklynites something to chomp on yet? – Christina Livadiotis

Steak Still Prime
***AUTHOR

***CONTENT
By Beth LandmanIn a struggling economy, steak continues to be a safe bet. It’s a Thursday evening at Midtown Manhattan’s Benjamin Steak House not long ago, but it almost feels like early last year, before the economic crisis hit with full force. Tables are full and waiters are hustling to deliver mammoth grilled chops and oversized lobsters. “We are doing better than last year,” maintains owner Ben Prelvukaj. “Our customers are 75% regulars.” Blocks away at Sparks there’s a wait for tables, and at Del Frisco’s, it’s a struggle to get close to the bar. You’d think that in these iffy financial times, meals at costly meat meccas would be among the first luxuries to be cut. But while many steakhouses are no doubt hurting, plenty of diners – and restaurateurs – remain bullish on the genre. “Steakhouses are the gold of the restaurant business – a safe place to park your money,” says food and restaurant consultant Clark Wolf. “In this economy, people want to know that they are getting something real and restaurateurs want security.” “You don’t want to open a molecular cuisine place now, but I would open a steakhouse again in another city, even in this climate,” says chef Alfred Portale of NYC’s Gotham Bar & Grill, who opened his first steer palace, Gotham Steak, at the Fontainebleau in Miami late last year. “It’s a much simpler concept than what I do in New York, and you can’t mess with it too much,” he observes. Indeed, the steakhouse formula is something of a sacred cow, and it can be risky to toy with it – as Jean-Georges Vongerichten learned when he opened V in NYC’s Time Warner Center back in 2004. Its deconstructed dishes and playful variations on the classics failed to wow and Vongerichten closed it after a brief run. “I live and learn,” says the über-chef, who notes that “two things you can’t retouch are steakhouses and Chinese food” (he closed 66, his modern take on Chinese, in 2007). Jean-Georges Vongerichten But the V experience hardly soured Vongerichten on steakhouses. His classic-style Prime in Las Vegas has fared much better; business there, he says, has declined only 1% this year. He also recently launched J&G, a new line of traditional steakhouses. The first opened in Scottsdale’s The Phoenician Hotel last year; another is slated for Washington, DC, this summer, with more to follow. “Nobody wants to test somebody’s genius at this point. We are trying to survive, and steakhouses are the way to go.” The formula has several advantages for restaurateurs. The menu is sure to be a crowd-pleaser and labor costs are low. “There is no pressure to find a name chef, and if the chef leaves, customers aren’t concerned,” says Stephen Starr, who owns Barclay Prime in Philadelphia and added Butcher & Singer last year. “We were already far along with Butcher & Singer when the bottom fell out, so we had no choice but to open, and luckily, right now it’s the hottest thing in Philly,” he boasts. Though Barclay Prime has dropped off a bit, Starr says he would open another steakhouse now, in New York, Miami or Washington, DC. “Everyone is hurting, but you aren’t taking much of a risk putting a New York strip into the broiler.” Nor are customers taking much of a risk that they’ll look out of touch with the economy – or at least that’s how restaurateur Myles Chefetz sees it. “If you were dining on foie gras and caviar, it might be considered bad taste right now, but emotionally, steakhouses don’t feel like excess, even though you might be spending $60 to $80 on one piece of meat,” says Chefetz, whose Prime One Twelve in Miami did $19 million in sales last year. Still, while volume at some chophouses may be steady, “are customers spending the same? No,” observes Tony Fortuna, an owner of trendy Manhattan steak spot T-Bar. And Fortuna, like others, is finding ways to adapt. “We used to serve an 8-oz. burger only at the bar; now we’ve added it to the regular menu and broadened the concept to include lamb and turkey burgers,” he says. “There is a lot more sharing, and we are featuring 15 wines by the glass.” In March, the Morton’s steakhouse chain introduced “power hours” (4:30–6:30 and 9 PM on) at most locations, featuring $6 plates including mini prime cheeseburgers. William Jack Degel, owner of three Uncle Jack's steakhouses in NYC (with two more in the works for Roslyn, Long Island, and Atlantic City), is offering enticements such as wine tastings and prix fixe deals. “Now you can’t wait for customers to walk in; you really have to drive the business,” he explains. Slashing wine prices is another tactic. “People still want the great cuts of meat, but they are trying to scale down the size of their checks, so we reduced our high-end wines tremendously, which has resulted in a real uptick,” says Stephen Hanson, whose B.R. Guest Restaurants owns Primehouse in Manhattan. Diners are also going for smaller steaks, like the half-cut options on the menu at Miami hot spot Meat Market, which opened last fall. “It’s not just about devouring massive pieces of meat,” says chef Sean Brasel. “In fact there are some nights we sell more fish.” And other restaurants have simply reduced the size of their standard portions. “In some places the classic 16-oz. cut of beef has shrunk to 12-oz.; they just serve it on a smaller plate,” says Andrew Silverman, whose Flatiron Restaurant Group owns Steak Frites and the recently opened Union Prime in NYC. But, he adds, “the key is the wine and the sides. Diners may be ordering less expensive wines, but they are still ordering them, and they love all those side dishes. Steakhouses will never go out of style.” Check out the list of NYC's Top Steakhouses.

Dan Barber Brooklyn went back to school last Saturday, May 2, when the first-ever Brooklyn Food Conference hit John Jay High School in Park Slope. The day was chock-full of workshops, lectures and films, not to mention plenty of familiar faces, including James Beard Award–winning chef Dan Barber (Blue Hill). The Buzz caught up with Barber following the “Our Sustainable Restaurants: A Roundtable of NYC Chefs” event to ask a few questions: Zagat Buzz: How do you think New Yorkers’ palates are changing? Dan Barber: People everywhere, but particularly in New York, are becoming more demanding in their dining choices. They are challenging the conventions of the general food industry by asking where their food came from, how it was grown, how it got to them. And that has a lot to do with seeking out the best flavor. ZB: You talked about the environmental repercussions of serving Wagyu beef, which is why you won’t offer it at your restaurants – can you elaborate? DB: When buying beef, here's what I'm looking for: preferably the animal should be whole, local and, as much as possible, raised on its natural diet—in this case, good old fashioned grass. ZB: What do you think the future of sustainability is in the New York City restaurant scene? DB: I don’t think it’s the job of the restaurant to force the tenets of sustainability down people’s throats. I try to provide our diners with a tasty meal and a story of where their food comes from. Even if it’s on an unconscious level, I hope that everyone makes the connection between the food on their plates and the places and processes behind it. That in turn makes people more aware of the issues underlying the meal, and it makes the food more delicious. ZB: What’s the most challenging thing about running a restaurant during this economic crisis? DB: The most frustrating thing has been to see the way [the recession] has hurt some local farmers, who are finding it harder to compete in an industry that tends to look for the lowest common denominator. ZB: How do you feel about being named as one of Time’s “100 Most Influential People,” and about Ferran Adrià writing the piece? DB: I’m incredibly flattered and, to be honest, a little bit shocked. ZB: Which of your spring menu items is your favorite? DB: We just got our first asparagus last week. I’m eating it right now. – Aleksandra Shander

Add Ray’s Hell Burgers to the growing list of places where one or both of the Obamas have been spotted dining since arriving in Washington in early January. Yesterday the president and Vice President Biden paid a surprise visit to the Arlington, VA, burger joint, waiting in line like everyone else and refusing the offer of free grub. Here’s a tidbit from Ray’s owner Michael Landrum on his encounter with POTUS. The momentous meal was also captured on the video seen above. Holding true to a promise that he’d get out in the community, the president has sampled various eateries, both high-brow and, well, not so high-brow. On May 2, he and the First Lady had a date night in Georgetown at Michel Richard’s acclaimed Citronelle, where a special meal was prepared for the First Couple. Shortly before the inauguration, the president-elect popped into Bobby Van’s Steakhouse on 15th Street Downtown for a cocktail reception, and caused a stir during a meal with DC Mayor Adrian Fenty at the landmark Ben’s Chili Bowl in the U Street Corridor. Several days later, he and a group of friends gathered to celebrate Michelle Obama’s 45th birthday at Equinox, Todd and Ellen Gray’s New American steps from the White House. For her part, Michelle Obama has been sighted noshing at the Dupont Circle Five Guys with her staff and, more recently, at Capitol Hill’s Art and Soul, Art Smith’s midpriced American.

David Drake Photo: courtesy of the restaurant The 2009/10 New Jersey Restaurants guide is out now, and some familiar champs continued to rule the roost. Middletown’s Nicholas swept the Food, Service and Most Popular lists for another year, while Hamilton's Rat's once again was the big cheese for Decor. However, there were some dramatic fluctuations worthy of the stock market elsewhere in the Food list: Lorena’s jumped from 13th to second for Decor, David Drake from 14th to third and Ajihei from 26th to fourth. Trend of the year? Big toques opened more recession-friendly concepts, including Bobby Flay’s Bobby's Burger Palace, Stephen Starr’s Teplitzky’s and Michael Cetrulo’s Stella Marina. As a bonus, the beach-bound will want to check out the just-released 2009/10 New Jersey Shore Restaurants pocket guide.

Table Talk With Govind Armstrong

***CONTENT
Govind Armstrong Photo: courtesy of Table 8 A whiz in the kitchen from an early age – he apprenticed at Spago when he was 13 – Govind Armstrong has already made quite a name for himself with LA's Table 8 and 8 Oz., both of which have expanded to Miami Beach. In addition, he's a cookbook author, and his outgoing personality and good looks landed him on People's “50 Most Beautiful” list in 2004. Now New York gets to see what all the fuss is about when Armstrong opens an outpost of Table 8 in the new Cooper Square Hotel later this week. Before things get too hectic, Armstrong took a few minutes to talk with us about his new venture, the New York restaurant scene and the future of his currently-on-hiatus LA flagship. Zagat Buzz: Still in friends-and-family dinners? Govind Armstrong: Yeah, we have a couple more events for the next few days and then on the 6th we hope to be officially open. ZB: That soon? GA: If all goes well. We’re seeing how the next few nights go – we’ll probably have some last-minute changes to work through. And then we’ll head into our soft opening. ZB: How long have you been thinking about bringing Table 8 to New York? GA: Four years. It’s been a very long time, and these last few months have been very intense. After a long time of waiting and planning and building and all that comes the rush to get things actually up and running. You have to shift gears and it’s intense. No matter how much you plan things, there are always a lot of hiccups along the way with materials and all. But it's fun, though, and I do enjoy it. ZB: Were you always planning on being affiliated with the Cooper Square Hotel? GA: Yeah. We all came together four years ago, with one of the developers who isn’t really involved anymore. ZB: And I take it you're happy with the way the restaurant is shaping up in the hotel? GA: I could not be happier. It is such a beautiful hotel. It's everything one could hope it would be. I’ve been staring at it on paper for so long. Just seeing the progress of it – it’s just gorgeous. After all those meetings and renderings, consulting on materials, and textures and things that will go in the restaurant and throughout the hotel, to see the finished project, it’s just been an amazing experience. To see everything in its place, down to the finishing in the restaurant, and how it all fits together extremely well, has just been a joy for me. ZB: The textures were one of the things that stood out to me, I especially liked the sloped tilework over the bar. GA: Everything is there for a reason. The whole sloping of that ceiling is because the area above it, on the second floor, is where the screening room is. We have stadium seating up there (I think we seat 15–20 people), so we had to work that shape into the bar. And now we have this really dramatic entrance that just slopes down and leads diners into the dining room. I thought incorporating the blue subway tiles tones it down a bit but keeps it vibrant. I also think the slate floors work extremely well – it continues into the hotel lobby as well. I love all the furnishings too. The chairs and ottomans, they’re just so comfortable and really bring in that residential feel where you just want to come in with some friends, relax and enjoy some good food. I think the bar is going to be one of the focal points of the restaurant. It's just a really well-laid-out restaurant and I’m extremely happy with that. It’s not huge – not one of those big things where you feel like you are in a hotel restaurant. ZB: Did you say you’ve been staying at the hotel? GA: Yeah, I’ve been living here since December. [The hotel] opened initially on the 11th of December with 35 rooms, and now all the floors are open with a total of 145. And I’m going to be taking care of all of the food and beverage. All the room service and everything for the entire hotel. ZB: Since you now have restaurants in New York, LA and Miami, how do those dining scenes differ? GA: I think New Yorkers are a little more critical. There are so many more great restaurants out here than in either of the other two cities, so it’s a lot more competitive. And definitely some of the best chefs in the world are out here. So it is going to require a lot more attention from me and attention to detail. That is one of the main reasons I’m relocating out here – to make sure that things go the way they should. But really I’m just happy to be out here and to be a part of it. ZB: Any word on when the original Table 8 will reopen in LA? GA: I needed to take some time to focus on this one and just not worry. I’ve put that one on hold for awhile. We opened 8 Oz. in the old location in July and that is doing extremely well, so I’m not too concerned with that at this point. And once [the New York Table 8] is up and running smoothly, it will be a much easier transition. What I’ll do in LA is basically take the same menu, or the structure of the menu, and swap out a few dishes. We’ll cater it to the market with all those local products, swap out the East Coast fish for West Coast fish and really just make it as seamless of a transition as possible. But New York is definitely my new home for sure, and I couldn’t be more excited about that. ZB: And what about the rumors that you are going to bring 8 Oz. to New York? GA: Um, I don’t know about that. Table 8 is what I’m focusing on right now. Maybe down the road? But with that concept in New York, there is already so much competition. It’s a solid concept – I’m really happy with the way things are going there, but that’s something that is way down the line, if ever. There is plenty to do here at Table 8 that should encompass all of my energy and attention. – Garth Johnston

From the department of unheralded openings, the folks behind the well-regarded Italian Sfoglia in the Upper East Side (and Nantucket) are headed Downtown. Chef-owner Ron Suhanosky is putting the finishing touches on a new Italian called Civetta Ristorante on 98 Kenmare Street (as rumored by Grub Street last year). The newcomer is aiming to open to the public around May 18 (212-274-9898).

We've already mentioned the party at Eleven Madison Park, but that isn't the only spot where you can watch before resorting to the OTB. In honor of the race, Union Square's Tocqueville has whipped up an \"Orange Derby\" ($14) to sip during the fastest two minutes in sports – you can even make it yourself at home, as the recipe is after the jump. Primehouse New York and Wildwood Barbeque will also both be screening the race and offering themed fare like classic Juleps, and Bourbon pecan pie. Now about that hat...Orange Derby Makes OneOrange blossom water 3 fresh mint sprigs plus 1 for garnish 2 oz.

Don't pretend you wouldn't try it. Photo: Courtesy of Savoy We’re fully in support of any holiday that lets you drink in the fashion of the gentleman above without shame. And if said holiday needs to be pegged to a vegetable, so be it. Calçotada, the traditional Catalan onion festival that marks the start of spring, will be celebrated at sibling restaurants Back Forty (May 12) and Savoy (May 13), which will both serve grilled calçots with romesco sauce, accompanied by lamb chops, housemade botifarra sausage and crema Catalana. But what, you’re surely asking, is the deal with that jug? That’s the porron, from which rosé will be poured into the mouths of unabashed revelers ($60 per person, excluding tax and gratuity; includes food and wine; call restaurants to make pre-paid reservations; menu will also be available à la carte at Back Forty from May 14–21).

Chef Sam Mason says he’s “slowly rolling out” his spring menu, but Zagat readers can get a preview taste with this three-course dinner. Showcasing ingredients fetched from the Union Square Greenmarket (Mason's market of choice, “despite the abundance of baby strollers and dogs”), the deal offers two choices for each course, including brisket braised with Waylon bourbon, accompanied by parsnip purée, burnt carrots and orange, a seared red snapper with watermelon, olive, and Mason’s favorite spring produce, ramps. Dinner also includes a choice of cocktail, including the beet sangria pictured above.

The trailer for the much anticipated (by foodies at least) Nora Ephron movie Julie & Julia – an adaptation of Julie Powell's book and blog, which chart her year-long attempt to cook all of the recipes in Julia Child's Mastering the Art of French Cooking – has hit the Internets. Check it out here. It's worth a watch, if just for a look at Meryl Streep's impersonation of Mrs. Child. But since the film doesn't come out until August 7, what is the hungry Child fan to do in the meantime? For the real deal herself, well, look no further than the PBS website, which has begun streaming some of Child's classic television programs here. Or, for a humorous spin, you can't go wrong with Dan Aykroyd's infamous Saturday Night Live impersonation (which actually makes an appearance in the film).

Fortunately, the just-released 2009/10 Long Island Restaurants guide has you covered, offering reviews of 852 eateries across the isle based on the experience of 5,854 diners. Topping the list for food this year was the recently relocated Kitchen A Bistro in St. James, while Jedediah’s in Jamesport made the biggest impression on surveyors with its decor. Finally, for those who looking to pack light for their Jitney ride, we’ve got a separate pocket guide focused strictly on the Hamptons.

With the weather finally starting to match the season (it's supposed to hit 80° this weekend), the mind starts wandering to leisurely pursuits, like picnicking in the park. If only there was some way to picnic without, well, having to make an actual picnic. To the rescue comes AQ Kafé, the Scandinavian spot right off Columbus Circle, which has added a \"Picnic in the Park\" option to its repertoire. For $14.95 per person, the cafe will box up a to-go meal including a choice of sandwich or salad, side, dessert and drink. And if you have four or more people ordering, they'll throw in a frisbee as well (212-541-6801).

photo: courtesy of the Musuem of Burnt Food For a few minutes of Hump Day distraction, we can heartily recommend the peerless Burnt Food Museum website. It was started after its curator discovered that hot apple cider, left to cook for too long, can become a freestanding object d'art. The museum's \"collection\" also includes burnt cutlery, waffles, lemons and more – truly, a marvel to behold. You can even submit your own addition to the collection (because really, who doesn't enjoy burning stuff?), but just remember, \"to cook the Museum way – always leave the flame on low ... and then take a long nap.\" To which we add, \"and always keep a fire extinguisher handy.\"

‘Secret’ barrooms are an NYC tradition dating back to Prohibition, and the latest is Cabin Down Below, a tiny, unmarked space below an East Village pizzeria; furnished like a cozy den with wood paneling, bookshelves and a fireplace, it plays eclectic music, draws a hip (and sometimes famous) crowd and serves no-frills drinks (i.e. no fancy-schmancy specialty cocktails); N.B. there’s also a small patio for nicotine fiends. 110 Ave. A, downstairs See more details Checked out the Cabin?

But with this being spring, the season of rebirth, the group has moved on from the chicken to the egg. Now until June 20, each restaurant in the group, excluding Shake Shack, is offering a special egg dish, with options ranging from a sunny-side-up egg with arugula, bacon and black pepper–ginger chicken livers at Tabla to a slow-poached farm egg in a jar with lobster and sunchokes in sea urchin broth at The Modern. Two bucks from each egg dish purchased will be donated to City Harvest. For you try-it-at-home folks, the recipes are all right here [PDF].

But where to eat after attending one of the special events planned for the day? We've rounded up a few eco-friendly restaurants where you can enjoy locally sourced fare that won't make you feel guilty about your carbon footprint. All of Mario Batali and Joe Bastianich's restaurants are celebrating Earth Day with menu additions, including a farmer's market–inspired appetizer at Babbo, a number of specials at Becco and a locally sourced three-course menu at Lupa. Check with each restaurant for further details. Meanwhile, in an effort to raise money for endangered gorillas, Peanut Butter & Co., Pinch & S’MAC, Serendipity III, A Salt & Battery, Crumbs, the Dessert Truck and the Treats Truck are all offering specials for the month of April – Earth Month, natch. When you purchase one of the dishes, like Serendipity's \"Gorillas in the Pudding,\" a portion of the sales will be donated to the Wildlife Conservation Society. NoHo Italian Il Buco is reducing lunch prices across the board by 15% from April 21–25, and then contributing that discounted amount to help protect the Amazon. At Sacred Chow, diners who show up with their own tupperware for takeout (or doggy bags for leftovers) will receive 20% off their bill. Upper East Side newcomer Rouge Tomate is using the day to bring awareness to the farmers it sources from by holding a farmer's market on 60th Street starting at noon. In addition, it will also be giving out free Earth Day bags to its customers. While East Village vegan spot Counter has yet to finalize its plans for Earth Day proper, it does know what it will be doing the day after. The restaurant will be hosting the after-party for an event called Project Earth Day, offering plenty of tasty treats for a $10 cover. Finally, special cocktails made with TRU Organic Spirits will be offered at Broadway East, Cornelius, Flatbush Farm and Gusto Organics, and the spirit maker will plant a tree for every one sold. Want more? You can always try one of the options on our Vegetarian Tops list.

Previous winners include Gaultiero Marchesi (2008), Alice Waters (2007), Albert and Michel Roux (2006) and Paul Bocuse (2005). When told that he would be the 2009 recipient, Robuchon asked: “Does this mean that I’m in the autumn of my life as a chef, my best years are behind me or just that I am known to have given a little pleasure to gourmets and meaning to our beautiful profession?” Watch for a later post announcing the organization’s 50 best restaurants in the world.

For the third year in a row, The Washington Post has invited readers to send in photographs of homemade Peep dioramas, the best of which it runs on its website. And what results! This year's crop brings recreations of everything from classic paintings (above) to television dramas (Dexter) and cooking shows (Iron Peeps, Top Peep) to musicals (Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Peep Street) and real events (Obama's inauguration, the in-Hudson landing of US Airways Flight 1549). Really, you should just check them out yourself here.

Shang chef Susur Lee will likely be steering the kitchen at DC's Donovan House when it begins serving its full menu sometime next month. This chic venue, currently called Cha, has been serving drinks and sushi since mid-January, and was slated to showcase Todd English’s talents, but last week the plan changed, and it looks like chef Lee will take charge. Whether the name will change is unclear, but we hear that the restaurant will begin debuting a few of Lee’s dishes as early as this week.

Highline is now SEA.

So far, not much has changed – both the menu and the South-Beach-meets-Austin-Powers design are virtually intact – though management plans on tweaking both the upstairs and downstairs lounges. Given the soft opening of the nearby Standard Hotel and June unveiling of the Highline itself, it seems like this stretch of Washington Street is poised to become quite the busy boulevard (835 Washington St.).

Slow-cooked suckling pigs are everywhere these days, and Midtown newcomer La Fonda del Sol is no exception. In his second video in an ongoing series, La Fonda executive chef Josh DeChellis demonstrates his spin on the classic dish served with smoked dates and almonds, walking curious diners through the process from butchering to plating. Squeamish diners beware: a half pig carcass does get some screen time (212-867-6767; reserve online).

Vintage Wrap: A Sweet Finale

***CONTENT
Meryle Evans, a culinary historian and contributing editor at Food Arts magazine, proved an invaluable resource for Zagat’s Vintage Dinner series, providing 19th-century menus and historical insight to some of the chefs as they prepared their meals. Here she reflects on some of the more memorable moments, including the 72-cake \"caravan\" that capped off the night at Jean Georges. For a behind-the-scenes look at the dessert extravaganza, watch the video below. A night to remember? How about 16 nights of dazzling dinners? As a culinary historian tracking the Zagat Vintage Dinners series for an article in Food Arts, I was blown away by the enthusiasm, imagination and extraordinary amount of research that New York’s top toques devoted to the planning and execution of these remarkable repasts. Poring through old cookbooks, reviving recipes from apprenticeship days and enlisting equally enthusiastic staffs to create distinctive period decor, entertainment and beverage pairings, the chefs choreographed dinners that captured the essence of a bygone era, but still remained perfectly attuned to the ambiance of their own 21st-century establishments: Del Posto’s bella Italia cucina based on the seminal cookbook by Pellegrino Artusi; the robust 75-lb. steamship roast Terrance Brennan carved tableside at Picholine; Le Bernardin’s fish-focused menu featuring a whole striped sea bass with champagne sauce; the re-creation of 19th-century fine hotel dining at Alain Ducasse’s Adour at the St. Regis. That sense of place was vividly evoked at two recent, totally different, dinners: Mike Anthony’s intimate, convivial Colonial American feast for 20 guests in the private dining room at Gramercy Tavern and the sumptuous caviar-and-truffle extravaganza for 70 in the main dining room at Jean Georges. At Gramercy Tavern, Anthony composed a locavore bill of fare that also managed to stay true to an era two centuries before that word entered our vocabulary. “The idea was not to reproduce a meal, but prepare something delicious in [that] style,” Anthony explained. “I was aiming for the warmth of a dish that looks back in time but also has delicacy and contrasting textures.” Oysters were a given – during the 19th century, oysters were so abundant in New York that they were hard to sell, and so large that the writer William M. Thackeray remarked that eating one was “like swallowing a baby.” Fortunately, our crisp fried Fisher Island bivalves were small and succulent, perched atop a pool of light fish stock with onion and spinach purée, mixed chopped herbs, garlic, oil and lemon juice. House-smoked ham and a medley of green market beans in a wine vinegar and pork sauce were a tribute to the all-purpose pig – smoked, cured, pickled head-to-trotters – in an era of no refrigeration. And later there were bravos for a pig encore, a whole suckling roast that recalled an early traveler’s description of a Fourth of July celebration when booths lined Broadway for miles “and in every booth there was a roast pig, large or small as the center of attraction. Six miles of roast pig!” The rivers, bays and seashore surrounding the city also swarmed with fish and shellfish during that time, so Anthony salted his own cod and added it to individually poached lobster, scallops and mussels served in a light tomato-based chowder. A bounty of birds – wild turkeys, geese, doves, grouse, quail – inspired a dish of guinea hen accompanied by fritters made with sweet potato purée and pâte à choux, the latter a nod to the culinary influence of Gallic refugees (including the great gourmet Brillat-Savarin) who found a haven in New York during the French Revolution. Finally, early travelers also remarked on Americans' penchant for sweets, and what could be more appropriate than the apple pudding with clotted cream that pastry chef Nancy Olsen selected for a Tavern dessert. From a simple pudding, fast-forward to the mid-20th century for the astonishing cavalcade of 72 cakes that were paraded around the dining room as the grand finale to Jean-Georges Vongerichten’s homage to Fernand Point – considered the father of modern French cuisine – and Point’s protégé, Louis Outhier, in turn Vongerichten’s revered mentor. “I don’t usually do this kind of dessert,” admitted executive pastry chef Johnny Iuzzini, “but Jean-Georges was so enthusiastic, going back to his book of handwritten recipes from his apprenticeship, that it was infectious.” Even after swooning over seven savory courses like lemon gelée with caviar and crème fraîche, sea bass en croûte, lobster à la nage and truffled chicken, guests were still hungry enough to tuck into the trademark Outhier array of classic pastries, among them chocolate and vanilla charlotte Cecile, glazed black-currant mousse, and almond sponge, hazelnut and Pernod noisette. “I feel like bringing everything back, having a caravan of desserts every night,” Vongerichten sighed, a reminder of Point’s philosophy that the duty of a good cuisinier is to transmit to the next generation everything he has learned and experienced. The Vintage Dinners certainly proved the point. – Meryle Evans

Riding Shotgun With Kogi

***CONTENT
Inside the Kogi truck Photo: Eric Shin Unless you've been living under a rock, you've probably heard about LA's Kogi trucks, which are drawing long lines of crowds hungry for Korean-Mexican fast food. We chatted with co-founder Caroline Shin-Manguera about the history of the concept and plans for the future, which include a potential expansion to New York. Merrill Shindler: I've seen every manner of fusion cuisine come down the pike here in Los Angeles. Except for Korean-Mexican. With 20-20 hindsight, it was clearly inevitable. What took so long? Caroline Shin-Manguera: I think it's a sign that the local melting pot is evolving, that a new generation is looking for something different. Actually, when you think about it, the cuisines and cultures are very similar. They're both based on family values – for Koreans and Mexicans, everything revolves around food and family being together. But until recently, Koreans have been very conservative – they rarely mixed their food with any other food, except for Chinese and Japanese. But the times are changing. MS: Actually, there seem to be many points at which Koreans and Mexicans overlap. CS-M: It's true. There are large numbers of Latinos living in K-town – you'll find them eating at the restaurants, especially the hole-in-the-wall places, where they use the more intense flavors. Our foods are different. Except we both love our spices, our onions, our peppers, our rice. So maybe we're not that different. MS: What was the first day like – the first day the truck rolled onto the street? CS-M: We were waiting to get permits, and we took it to West Hollywood to test it out. Everyone just stared at us like, 'What's this taco truck doing in West Hollywood?' We parked in the busiest part of town, lots of foot traffic. Nobody would buy a taco. So, we started giving out free samples. People couldn't figure out why we would do that to a good taco. They told us, thanks, but no thanks. It was like that for the first two, three weeks. For weeks, we made no money at all. I mean, nothing. MS: So, what happened? CS-M: We got the idea of going to the clubs, and giving free samples to the bouncers. They liked it, and they let us stay. And word started to spread. We never expected to get this popular. We thought maybe six months or a year till anyone found us. It just kind of…exploded. MS: Was there one night that was the turning point? CS-M: I think it was the first time we parked outside of a club called Green Door in Hollywood. People tried it before going into the club. Then, they came back for a second. And then, we got the idea of e-mailing food bloggers, and inviting them to give it a try. They started writing about us. And suddenly, we were slammed. MS: So, you're a creation of the Internet? CS-M: If it wasn't for the Internet, we'd be in the hole for who knows how much. The Internet made us. It was our lifeline. We all had other jobs, which we held on to. After our day jobs we went to the truck, worked till two in the morning. And then, we went viral. We were all over the Internet. MS: The first truck led to a second truck. Which has led to a sit-down operation inside a bar. Is there a limit to growth? Will success spoil the Kogi? CS-M: As far as we're concerned, the sky's the limit. Everything happened on a fluke. We got the idea after we got drunk one night. We had a friend who had an extra catering truck we could borrow. We didn't make it in West Hollywood, so we headed for the clubs of Hollywood. Which led to The Brig in Venice, and we became a regular there. We don't try to control it. It just has its flow, and we're along for the ride. MS: But sit-down? Isn't that kind of bourgeois? CS-M: The Alibi Room is a bar, which means there's alcohol, which goes very well with our food. It's also a central commissary for us, so it works very well – we can prep 500 pounds of meat at once, rather than going to the market all day long. It allows us to grow. MS: Would this work in other cities? CS-M: Right now, our two goals are a stand in LA and to do something in New York – a truck or a stand, we haven't figured out which. We've had a lot of good feedback from New Yorkers. I guess we'll find out if it's a complete fluke, an only-in-LA thing. We'll find out the way we've done everything – by trying. MS: And do you get upset when people describe the truck as a roach coach? CS-M: At first we did, because our food is better than that. But now we think it's funny. And anyway, the people who say it are the regulars on line. So how bad could it be? – Merrill Shindler

Vintage Wrap: La Grenouille

La Grenouille chef Matthew Tropeano Photo: courtesy of the restaurant La Grenouille's Vintage Dinner may have come and gone, but the sights (and tastes) of it still remain in our memory. We spoke to chef Matthew Tropeano to gather his thoughts on the dinner, find out his inspirations and discover why he'd like to return to the swinging '60s. Zagat Buzz: What inspired the menu, and did it influence your cooking style at all? Matthew Tropeano: There were a couple of books that I looked through, one that was a compilation of Joël Robuchon, where he executes recipes from the French sculptor August Rodin. It was interesting to read how, back then, a simple thing like a grapefruit was considered a dessert. These days I think people are going back to more simple ways because, number one, it’s economical and, number two, people are comforted by that stuff. Not saying we’re going to start serving grapefruit here, but we can be inspired by simple flavors and utilize what we have, as opposed to overpaying for certain ingredients. ZB: Since the restaurant normally serves traditional French, in what way did you try to make the Vintage Dinner menu different? MT: Only the oxtail is really on the menu. So it was a cool challenge to research the dishes, see how they were made and try to adapt them to the ingredients we have now. Most of the recipes and dishes were really simple – just a couple of ingredients, done in a different way. On our daily menu, we have a balance of classic dishes, but the key to the Zagat dinner was really understanding what it was all about and executing vintage, classic dishes. For the younger cooks here, too, it was really educational and fun. ZB: After seeing the response to the dishes, are there items you would consider adding to one of your menus? MT: I think for a special, definitely the pheasant. I would do that as something of a classic. But classic doesn’t always mean old, it means timeless. People always enjoy it, no matter what year it is. I think every dish we put out, I would be proud to run as specials once in a while. ZB: The wine pairings worked exceptionally well. What was your approach in choosing wines? MT: Obviously a hundred years ago, you couldn’t serve a ’95 vintage wine. With dining, especially French dining, we always try to find a balance between food and wine – not overdoing either the dish or the wine, instead using restraint, as seen with the La Gitana sherry and billy-bi pairing. People are scared of sherry, they think it’s medicine. But a night like that was a great night to discover sherry. It was very popular a hundred years ago, and that was a nice way to see something old that is new again. Table setting for La Grenouille's Vintage Dinner Photo: Rebecca Klasfeld ZB: Were there any techniques or cooking methods you found while researching that proved helpful in preparing the dinner? MT: The chartreuse of pheasant – it’s basically wrapping foie gras, pheasant, truffles and aromatic vegetables inside cabbage and then steaming it so it stays very moist. In all the recipes that I’ve seen, you wrap that whole thing up in lard and then you make one large one and then you’d cut it like a cake. I think that’s an amazing way to cook it, but for our purposes here, I wanted to do them individually, using the same flavors. The end result was more of a modern technique. The foundation of this restaurant, as far as the kitchen goes, is technique. We do things the old way – we roast, we poach in real liquid, not in plastic bags. It’s one restaurant in New York where we really respect the past, where things came from, and we really try to progress into the future with it. ZB: There were some unexpected complications that night. How did this affect your preparation for the meal? MT: We had quite a crazy day – with our water main, with customers downstairs and with the health inspector. If you wanted to take one single day and know what it was like to run a restaurant, and you’d seen that day, you’d never want to run a kitchen or a restaurant. But we have such a strong team. The one thing that we could rely on was: ‘okay, it’s time to cook for this thing,’ and we knew exactly what we wanted to do. ZB: Are there any other time periods you would like to explore? MT: I can’t do the future, right? I guess it would be cool to be a cook in the early ‘60s, late ‘50s, when nouvelle cuisine was really coming on. That was the real, new trend that I think we’re all a product of now. If I could go back, I’d like to see what La Grenouille was like when it first opened.

Lastly, one of the bakery's staples, the classic shortbread cookie, has been transformed to resemble the cute bunnies seen above ($4 each; 212-823-9366). Though they're available at all three locations, if the bunnies' adorableness inspires an instant \"eat me\" reaction (and we wouldn't blame you), click past the jump for the recipe.

Talai Berri Txakolina at Las Ramblas Photo: courtesy of the restaurant Village tapas spot Las Ramblas is tooting the horn for the arrival of Talai Berri Txakolina 2008, a seasonal Basque wine from Getaria, Spain, that’s rarely found in New York. Pronounced “CHA-koh-lee,” the yellow-green vino is slightly effervescent, which is enhanced by being poured through a special T-shaped spout from a height of one to two feet above the glass. Sounds like a refreshing spring tipple – and a server’s worst nightmare.

photo: Ohad Ben-Yoseph Passover, which celebrates the Jewish exodus from Egypt, starts at sundown April 8 and continues for the next eight days. While some Jewish restaurants, like the 2nd Avenue Deli and Rectangles, will be closed, many others are hosting seders on the first and second nights (April 9 and 10) or adding special dishes to their menus: Abigael's on Broadway: This Garment District kosher is hosting prix fixe seders on the first and second nights; it's also selling meals to go (8:30 PM; $117 per person; click here for menus and more information). Capsouto Frères: Continuing its 22-year tradition, this TriBeCan French bistro is offering authentic Sephardic (non-kosher) first- and second-night seders complete from the cantor down to the haroset. All proceeds go to American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee (6:30 PM; $150 minimum per seat; 212-966-4900). Commerce: Offering à la carte Passover dishes ranging from housemade matzo bread to truffled matzo ball soup, this West Villager is celebrating for all eight days (prices to be determined; 212-524-2301). Dos Caminos: Though this Mexican Park Avenue South isn't offering a seder, on Saturday, April 4, it's hosting a three-hour tutorial on cooking a Mexican-style seder, which includes lunch and drinks (11:30 AM–2:30 PM; $65 per person, includes lunch, cocktails, recipes and a cookbook; 212-331-0328). JoeDoe: Celebrating a \"progressive Passover,\" this funky East Villager is offering an early four-course seder including dishes like stuffed matzo ball soup, \"Dr. Rita's Brisket\" and a special Passover cocktail called the \"Drunken Pharaoh\" made of Manischewitz fused with bourbon and fresh lemon, completed with a sugared matzo rim (April 7; $45 per person; 212-780-0262). Payard Bistro: François Payard’s UES bistro is offering Passover options to go, including almond-coated, double-dipped caramel and dark chocolate–covered matzo ($5) and holiday petit fours ($26 per pound), and is also hosting three-course kosher-style seders on the first and second nights featuring a decadent matzo ball soup with white truffle oil ($45 per person; 212-717-5252). Prime Grill: This Midtown kosher steakhouse is offering first- and second-night seders consisting of four courses and four glasses of wine for both private parties and the general public (8:30 PM on April 8, 8:45 PM on April 9; $125 per adult; $65 per child; 212-692-9292). Sammy's Roumanian: This long-standing Lower East Side spot continues its Passover tradition with two first- and second-night seders that include a 20-minute Haggadah (prayer book) reading, loads of traditional food and drink as well as live entertainment (5 PM and 8:30 PM; $89 per person; 212-673-0330). Savoy: For those looking for a Sephardic celebration, this SoHo standard is focusing on the cuisine of Syrian Jews for its four-course feast (6 PM and 6:45 PM on April 8, 6 PM on April 9; $95 per person; 212-219-8570). Tabla: Floyd Cardoz brings a \"New Indian\" approach to the holiday for his annual second-night seder at the Madison Square Park standout. Though it features communal seating and a Haggadah reading, this six-course celebration certainly won't be like your bubbe's (6 PM; $95 per adult; $50 per child under 12; 212-889-0667). Telepan: Bill Telepan's eponymous UWS New American is offering a four-course, non-kosher take on traditional seder dishes both nights ($65 per person; 212-580-4300).

Chefs at Inakaya yell out your order. Photo: Ryan Charles Upon entering Megu in TriBeCa, you're met by a demure hostess who leads you down clay-tiled steps past flowers and temple bells. But just as you hit the bottom landing, you're jolted out of your serene state when your escort shouts at the top of her lungs, “Irashaimase!” As if you’ve entered the set of some bizarre musical, the waiters and other staff stop mid-action, execute a choreographed turn toward you and echo back the Japanese welcome: “Irashaimase!” Other diners turn and stare, and the more exuberant ones shout along. It’s clearly not the best dining destination for an illicit affair. Bond Street, kitschy Ninja, ramen shop Ippudo and even pricey Kuruma Zushi in Midtown have all adopted the Japanese practice of shouting greetings and sometimes, as you exit, “arigato gozaimasu” (“thank you very much”). And the new Inakaya, which opened at the end of February in the New York Times building, takes the concept one step further by yelling out a customer’s order when it's given – woe be to the cheating dieter. “This is not typical; it’s something we created,” explains Yu Koyama, the restaurant’s general manager. “It began at our restaurant in Japan, where the waiters have to relay the order to the robata chef, and we are trying to duplicate that here. Yelling generates energy.” According to Shingo Yonezawa, owner of the popular Union Square sushi spot Japonica, spirited shouting is a way of letting diners know you are busy, and to give the impression that your seafood is fresh. But, it's not just for the customers. “It’s also a way to build up the morale of the staff,” he says. In case you're not sure what your role is in this choreographed scene, the answer should come as a relief: you are basically a prop. “Just smile, and don’t say anything,” suggests Yonezawa. Not all Japanese restaurants are in line with the zealous vocal approach, however. “Many restaurants in Japan welcome you with cheers so that your spirits are lifted and you can enjoy your meal in happiness,” says Kiyoshi Nogawa, general manager of Sushi Zen in the Theater District. “Yelling 'welcome' also signals to the staff that they should be ready to serve a new guest. However, we prefer to welcome our guests with a traditional Japanese phrase that is spoken rather than yelled. We are pursuing a more luxurious and upscale experience, and feel we can use this quieter welcome to strike a friendship with the guest and alert our staff without disrupting the Zen-like atmosphere of our restaurant and food.” And for that, those who favor quiet ambiance might whisper, “arigato gozaimasu.” – Beth Landman

As Eater announced, Thomas Keller's famed Per Se has introduced a new à la carte menu served daily in its salon. The six to eight rotating dishes run $12–$44, and include items from the regular tasting menus like butter-poached Nova Scotia lobster with beef brisket raviolo, sweet carrot buttons and glazed pearl onions with Bordelaise sauce (available on tonight's menu). The official dinner launch happened yesterday, but starting tomorrow, lunchers will be able to get a taste Fridays–Sundays, 11:30 AM–2 PM. The jacket-required dress code still applies, with no jeans, sneakers or shorts allowed; reservations aren't accepted, and as with the regular tasting menus, service is included in the price. For those anxious to take a peek at this evening's menu, here it is – the daily offerings will start appearing on the Per Se website in the near future (212-823-9335).

Inspecting the DOH

***CONTENT
Per Se is one of the city's \"Golden Apples.\" photo: Scott Whittle Photography Beginning July 2010, New York City’s Department of Health and Mental Hygiene will follow the lead of Los Angeles by requiring restaurants to display health-inspection letter grades in their front windows. With salmonella outbreaks popping up regularly in the news these days, it’s not a surprising move, especially when you consider that LA’s system seems to be working. A recent New York Times story reported that since the city introduced letter grades in 1998, there have been fewer incidences of food-borne illness – and that the number of A-grade restaurants rose from 40% in ’98 to 83% in 2007. The plan aims to keep diners informed and motivate restaurants to stay clean. One proponent of the system, New York State Senator Jeff Klein, thinks it will “provide a real incentive for restaurants with a ‘C’ hanging in the doorway to clean up their act.” To make sure that happens, establishments with lower grades will be inspected with greater frequency (i.e. “A” restaurants will be inspected once a year, “B” restaurants twice and “C” restaurants three times). The DOH inspects nearly 25,000 eating establishments a year – from street carts to upscale restaurants – and despite the recession, the city aims to add 50 inspectors to its existing team of 116 to keep pace. Much of the existing system will remain unchanged, however, including the actual inspection process, which will still use numerical scores as the basis for letter grades. Scores of 0–13 earn an A, 14–27 a B, and 28 and above a C. The DOH website currently lists every restaurant’s inspection history – last year the site was searched up to 19,000 times a month. A score of 28 or higher is considered a failing mark and mandates a further compliance inspection. On the other hand, there are a few restaurants with perfect scores, including Per Se and, believe it or not, White Castle in Jackson Heights. To salute these high-scorers, the DOH awards a “Golden Apple” designation for businesses that repeatedly receive good marks. Five Rules From the NYC DOH Food Protection Manual 1. Cooked chicken and turkey meat used in salads must be submerged in boiling water or stock and then refrigerated after being removed from the bone. 2. It is strictly prohibited to sell shellfish of any kind from a pushcart or other mobile vending operation in New York. 3. Whole frozen poultry must be thawed before being cooked, although a single portion may be cooked from the frozen state. 4. Though there are specifications for how long and at what temperatures meats should be cooked, a customer request can trump those rules. 5. Towels are never to be used for drying dishes, because they can cause contamination. The city also provides tools to help restaurateurs achieve a clean bill of health, including a food protection course that covers everything from reheating meats to washing hands. Every restaurant must have an employee who has completed the course on the premises at all times. But being prepared doesn’t guarantee a stress-free inspection. “Restaurants aren’t exactly excited to see you when you come in,” admits health inspector Corey Williams. Each visit begins the same way: the inspector arrives and notifies the manager, disclosing whether the search is routine or related to a specific complaint. Then the inspection moves to the kitchen and throughout the restaurant. “We talk to the head chef about the menu,” explains Williams; “[We check] for anything that might look strange, while watching to see the general sanitary practices in the kitchen.” The full inspector’s worksheet covers everything from the temperature of the fridge to the tiniest signs of insect infestation. Roughly 90 minutes later, depending on the scale of the operation, the inspector prints out a report and heads to the next establishment (three to four restaurants are typically covered per shift). While there are undoubtedly poor performances, the truly horrific stories are the exception rather than the rule. “Sure, everybody always has horror stories – hair in the food, mice, dead rats, live rats – I’ve seen it all,” emphasizes Williams. “But those places we close. There’s no reason for them to be serving food.” Disgruntled restaurateurs can challenge the findings at an administrative tribunal. Surprisingly, one thing that may be helping restaurants stay clean is the recession, as owners trying to mind the bottom line take care of their inventories. “There is a lot less food, less junk,” says Williams. “In the basements where there used to be seven full shelves, now there will be maybe four.” – Garth Johnston

Vintage Wraps: Gramercy Tavern

Gramercy Tavern's chef Mike Anthony and suckling pig Photo: Rebecca Klasfeld When chef Michael Anthony joined Gramercy Tavern, he revamped the famed New American’s menu to reflect his love of seasonal ingredients and locally produced food. So it’s no surprise that those were his focus in creating the menu for his Vintage Dinner. The chef spoke with the Buzz about the inspiration, highlights and techniques involved in preparing the dinner. Zagat Buzz: Was there a specific meal, book or historical figure that inspired your menu for the dinner? Mike Anthony: Clearly the concept of Gramercy Tavern lends itself [an old-fashioned] approach. The friendly and timeless setting, not to mention the wood-burning grill, provided tons of inspiration. I based the menu on a historical cookery book from Colonial Williamsburg and focused my ideas from conversations with Meryle Evans, a food historian who attended the meal. ZB: What do you consider to be your “style” and how did that translate into the special menu? MA: My approach to food focuses on highlighting seasonal ingredients and celebrating local producers. My goal is to present flavors that are memorable and anchored to a specific time and a place. While conceiving the menu for the Vintage Dinner, I applied the same principles to the theme of the \"18th-century tavern\" menu. I chose a group of ingredients that were meaningful to the culture and industry of that particular time and worked hard to present those ingredients in a thoughtful but straightforward way. ZB: Did you use any anachronistic techniques to prepare the food? Gramercy Tavern's Vintage table setting Photo: Rebecca Klasfeld MA: In general, contemporary American cooking has come full circle to embrace many natural methods of preservation. We use those techniques more to build flavor than to actually preserve food. So yes, we salted the cod, smoked the pig, pickled the cabbage, dried the pork loin and even cooked over an open wood-burning fire in ways that reflect a sense of history, but also taste relevant. ZB: How long did you cook the suckling pig for? Was any leftover? And if so, we hope the staff got to eat it. MA: The suckling pig was smoked for nine hours over hickory wood and basted with cider vinegar to produce that gorgeous mahogany color (we have a large smoker in the kitchen that we use to produce our own pastrami, bacon and smoked sausages). Most all of it was polished off between the dinner and our nibbling. ZB: Is there another era you might be interested in doing a Vintage Dinner from? MA: Any time period pre-World War II would be super interesting since that is the moment our food industry, farming and culture went through some of its most significant changes. We lost contact with the deep connection to food traditions by way of favoring efficiency and convenience. Our government instilled the motto of \"get big or get out\" within the farming community and developers enticed most of our grandparents to sell off their land. A chasm was created between the consumer and food preparation; we lost touch with the pleasure of eating and growing our own foods. I am very interested in reconnecting with our food and I feel adamant about giving it more priority in our culture. ZB: Did any particular dish resonate with the diners? MA: I have been flooded with positive responses from the guests, and favorites have been spread over the whole menu. I was particularly proud of how enthusiastically our staff approached the event. There was such an attentive vibe surrounding the preparation and execution of the meal. ZB: Would you bring any of the dishes back for your regular menu? MA: In fact, each of the dishes could very well, in some form, find their way on to the menu soon. ZB: Tangentially related, how is the USHG’s Chicken Soup promotion going over? MA: Danny [Meyer]'s idea could not have been more timely and on the money. What a great way to build business and boost morale at the same time – for both the restaurants and the guests. Besides, any initiative to support serving humble dishes, like a chicken soup that speaks to our audience, is welcome with me. ZB: Are you seeing a difference in the way that diners are eating in the new economy? Gramercy Tavern has an amazing fan base and a long history to keep it on course in troubled times. It has been known for offering great value in food, wine and hospitality, [and] I think that \"value\" remains what diners constantly seek out. In this economy every aspect of a restaurant is scrutinized. We have invested in new equipment and trained our staff to create an incredible coffee program that highlights Blue Bottle Espresso. The wine list regularly offers great values and passes on low prices that Juliette Pope digs up in wine auctions. The vintage beer list has grown even stronger, deeper and more popular. – Aleksandra Shander

Vintage Wraps: Le Bernardin

***CONTENT
Eric Ripert Photo: Nigel Parry Last week, Le Bernardin hosted its candlelit Vintage Dinner for a packed house eager to enjoy classic dishes and cabaret. The Buzz caught up with chef Eric Ripert in DC to talk about the dinner, the economy and the Légion d'honneur he was recently awarded by the French government. Zagat Buzz: Congratulations on receiving France’s Légion d'honneur. Do you see a difference between the recognition that the French give their chefs and the celebrity status that some achieve in the U.S.? Eric Ripert: Not really, in that both countries show a respect for chefs. But in the U.S. there is a different approach. In France, even today, chefs remain in the kitchen. Here, they are running multiple operations. There are only two chefs in France that would be considered “celebrity chefs” [in the American sense] – Alain Ducasse and Joël Robuchon. ZB: Speaking of chefs having diverse roles, can you give us a preview of your upcoming PBS television show, Avec Eric, that will be shown next fall? We understand that you filmed in Italy, Northern California and New York. ER: We visited interesting people in Italy and California – farmers, wine makers, chefs who are really connected to the source of the foods they serve by growing food in their own garden. Every show has three segments. Each episode starts behind the scenes at Le Bernardin. Then we travel for inspiration. And finally, I return to my kitchen to cook something stimulated by the tour. ZB: You are also an author – tell us about your recent book. ER: This is different from other cookbooks. It is geared to encourage people to cook at home, simply, with delicious products. ZB: Far from such simple cooking, you recently hosted a Vintage Dinner at Le Bernardin featuring an elegant 19th-century menu. Did you have a good time? ER: It was phenomenal. The men were dressed up in black tie; the women inspired by haute couture. Dinner was served by candlelight only. What really made the evening special was the re-created Victorian cabaret that followed the meal. ZB: Nineteenth-century banquet food has a reputation for being rich and heavy – not like Le Bernardin’s usual cooking – did you lighten the recipes? ER: We selected dishes that would provide a mix of light and rich courses. For example, we did a whole striped bass poached with a champagne sauce, followed by a wild hare à la royale – a very traditional but heavy preparation. ZB: What other eras would you like to try? ER: Perhaps a Renaissance dinner. It would be interesting to go back to 500 years ago and see what delicious food they were eating. Indeed, it might be interesting to do a different dinner for each century – and even project into the future. ZB: How are your restaurants responding to the economy? Your Westend Bistro [in DC] now serves a family-style Sunday Supper – a starter and entree for $28 per person. ER: We thought the Sunday Supper would encourage people to go out that night, and that it would be different and fun. But our restaurants won’t compromise on the quality of the product so they will keep prices where they are. People still want to eat well and to celebrate with good food and service. I am thrilled that Westend Bistro is busy. ZB: Recently Citronelle’s sommelier Mark Slater left to help [Ray’s the Steaks] develop a wine list featuring high-quality wines at accessible prices – with possible carafe, as well as by-the-glass, service. This move highlighted consumers' concerns about the cost of wine at high-end and even middle-level restaurants. What are your restaurants doing to make good wine more accessible to diners? ER: Of course it is possible to drink good wine for little money – but you need knowledge or good advice to help you choose. Wines by the glass can be good value if you want to drink a single serving – it's a way to taste an exceptional wine. And, really, when you consider the effort that it takes to make a good wine – so much work and passion – they are great values. And exceptional [wines] that cost lots of money are still being sold. Clients are more discreet than in the past, but they still want to enjoy them. – Olga Boikess

At last week's Vintage Drinks event at Keens Steakhouse we learned a fair amount about vintage drinking. Worried that we might not retain it all – what with the drinking – we persuaded the King of Cocktails himself, Dale DeGroff, to show us how to make the Morning Glory Fizz. Want to try it at home? Here's the recipe. And come back tomorrow for David Wondrich's lesson on how to make a Holland Gin Cocktail. Morning Glory Fizz from Modern Bartenders Guide, O.H. Byron, 1884 Ingredients: mixing glass 3/4 full with fine ice 3 to 4 dashes absinthe mixed in a little water 3 dashes lime juice 1 tbsp. sugar egg white 1 wine glass of Scotch Shake well in a shaker and strain. Balance off glass with seltzer. Drink immediately, or the effect will be lost. It's a morning beverage, a tonic and a nerve quieter.

Talking Tapas With Josh DeChellis

***CONTENT
Josh DeChellis photo: courtesy La Fonda del Sol Earlier this year, the Patina Group relaunched its iconic '60s Spanish La Fonda del Sol in the MetLife Building. We checked in with chef Josh DeChellis to see how Midtown was taking to tapas. Zagat Buzz: You opened a little late in the season during a tough economy. How are things going? Josh DeChellis: Well, I think. We’re focusing on making things better every day. It's definitely different than opening in the fall. From a chef’s perspective, it’s a little hard opening this time of year – we have so little to work with in terms of seasonal or inspiring vegetables. Even the boats going out can be tricky. We get a lot of stuff from day boats going out from Maine, and if the weather is too cold, these guys just don’t go out. ZB: La Fonda del Sol is basically two restaurants, with tapas downstairs and more formal dining upstairs. JD: It is. I look at the food downstairs more like a social catalyst than anything. I like the food to be shareable – something to talk about while you're socializing, drinking and having fun. Which is really what the whole tapas bar ritual is like in Spain. In the back dining room we have a more conventional dining environment with appetizers, entrees and dessert-type things. So we really get to express the full bandwidth of dining rituals that Spain offers, which are quite diverse. The tapas-focused front room at La Fonda del Sol Photo: Evan W. Miller ZB: How are you liking Midtown? JD: Just being at Grand Central is really awesome. People are using the tapas bar the way that tapas bars are supposed to be used. They’re swinging in and out for a quick drink. We even put free food up at the bar. People come in, grab a quick beer or a glass of sangria, maybe a bite and then head home to their dinner or family. Or they are coming in and waiting for friends to come in from work – just drinking and then going, \"Oh well, why don’t we get something to eat?\" It’s fun to watch. The bar gets packed at six o’clock, and we won’t see the majority of our food orders get rung through until seven, quarter after seven. It’s a really good litmus test of how they are using the tapas bar, and I couldn’t be happier about it. The best thing is, if somebody wants to eat the kind of Spanish food we’re doing, but doesn't want that kind of environment, they just roll upstairs. ZB: Are you seeing more of a lunch or dinner crowd? JD: Lunch is big here! [Downtown] you’d literally pay a two-top 20 bucks to sit at a table by the door before seven o’clock. Here it is the complete opposite. You're packed at six o’clock, but it tapers off at 9:30 or 10 PM. Whereas Downtown people are still waking up and coming in with their hair still wet. And Saturdays are a completely different ballgame here too. The neighborhood is quieter.

Photo: courtesy of Brian Turner Times may be tough, but the U.S. is still very fortunate when it comes to our clean, free drinking water. Which is why the Tap Project’s World Water Week, March 22–28, is so important. At participating restaurants, diners are invited to donate $1 or more for the tap water they usually enjoy for free; the money will go to help UNICEF’s efforts to provide water to children around the world – a single dollar offers a child 40 days of clean water.

The Upper West Side dining scene continues to grow with Fatty Crab, a new spin-off of Zak Pelaccio’s Village hit that incorporates all the key elements of the original: funky Malaysian street eats, one-of-a-kind cocktails and more-than-reasonable tabs; what’s different Uptown is the size, with twice as much seating as its sire, as well as a bigger bar, a private room and outdoor sidewalk seats; N.B. the thunderous rock soundtrack – heavy on the Robert Plant – is less intense in the side adjunct to the main room. 2170 Broadway; 212-496-2722 See more new restaurants in New York

Chicken Soup for Charity

***CONTENT
Daniel Humm Photo: courtesy of USHG For the month of March, each restaurant in the Union Square Hospitality Group (excluding Shake Shack) is offering its own special take on that most comforting of dishes, chicken soup, with $2 from each bowl sold going to benefit City Harvest. The Buzz talked to Eleven Madison Park chef Daniel Humm about the origin of the project and his rendition of the soup, a chicken velouté with sweetbreads and black truffles. Mouth watering yet? Check out all the recipes here. Zagat Buzz: How did this series come about? Daniel Humm: On a cold day earlier in the winter, Danny [Meyer, of the Union Square Hospitality Group] wasn’t feeling so well and went and got a chicken soup at Tabla – Floyd [Cardoz] makes a delicious chicken soup. After, he came over and said, ‘You know, what this town needs right now is a good bowl of chicken soup.’ So he challenged every chef in the company to come up with his own chicken soup. He didn’t give any rules; it just had to be a chicken soup. So we did. It's pretty exciting – they’re all different but they’re exactly what they should be. In every culture there is a chicken soup. ZB: Was chicken soup comfort food in your home? DH: It's something in the winter that you always have in the house. At home my mom always cooked – we’re a big family – and she’d cook lunch and dinner. She always made stock. Sometimes you’d walk into the kitchen in the morning and she’d start the stock with a whole chicken and some vegetables, and it just sits there during the day. So I’ve always been very familiar with the taste and the methods for how to do it. ZB: What was the inspiration for your take on the soup? DH: I love black truffles and this year has been such a great year for black truffles – one of the best years since I started cooking – so I wanted to combine something really simple like the chicken soup with something more luxurious. Our chicken soup is made typically: a whole chicken slowly cooked with vegetables. And the garnish in the soup is the vegetables it cooked with and also the chicken itself, so everything is used. But we thicken the broth with a roux and add a little sherry, and then we put the diced meat and the diced vegetables back in and we add a couple crispy sweetbreads and a couple shavings of truffles. But you don’t even need the truffles. ZB: And $2 from each soup is going to City Harvest? DH: Yes. We really believe in City Harvest. They really do what they say that they are going to do, and the restaurant and the whole company has been involved for many, many years. And so it just made sense, especially in these times, when there isn’t that much money being donated and all the nonprofit organizations are struggling. Whatever we can do to support it, especially in these times. The event runs at Union Square Cafe, Gramercy Tavern, Eleven Madison Park, Tabla, Blue Smoke and The Modern until March 31.

Catching Up With Keith McNally

***CONTENT
He’s at it again. With his revamp of Greenwich Village’s Minetta Tavern debuting this week, and a pizza and beer joint set to open next year, Keith McNally sure has a lot on his plate for someone who recently said he was finished opening restaurants. The esteemed restaurateur chatted with the Buzz on his past and future in the industry. Zagat Buzz: How long had you been interested in buying Minetta Tavern? Did you spend much time at the original? Keith McNally: My chef, Lee Hanson, mentioned in December '07 that Minetta Tavern was for sale. I reluctantly went along to look at it, but was taken by it immediately. Lee, by the way, and his co-chef at Balthazar, Riad Nasr, are my equal partners at Minetta Tavern. ZB: How do you plan on upholding the space’s history while attracting a contemporary audience? Are you keeping anything from the old menu? KM: Minetta Tavern is not a 'historic' place. It's a restaurant, not the Pantheon. But of course I'm keeping most of the original elements: the mahogany bar, the mural, the photographs, the tin ceiling. It's what attracted me to the restaurant in the first place. No one familiar with the Tavern from the past will know exactly what's changed. Apart from the gold fountain in the dining room, of course. ZB: Your restaurants famously attract a high-wattage crowd. Are you aiming for the same crowd with Minetta? KM: I don't seek out a high-wattage crowd any more than I seek out a low-wattage one. I build places that I want to go to, period. I also hope they appeal to the small group of people I admire, and also my staff. But after that, the only person I want to please is myself. I don't have a PR person and I don't socialize. I've no idea what the crowd at Minetta will be like. In this economy I'll be happy just to have a crowd – any crowd. ZB: Any scraps you can share about your planned pizza and beer operation? KM: The pizzeria on the Bowery and Houston is moving along at a snail's pace. But that's fast for me. It probably won't open for a year. ZB: Have you ever considered opening a restaurant outside of New York? Or even Uptown or Brooklyn? KM: I've considered it but for about nine seconds, no more. I'm only interested in opening restaurants in areas I've got a connection to. This means Downtown New York and nowhere else. What's the point? Unless it's for money. ZB: What do you think of the DOH’s planned letter-grade health inspection system? KM: My opinion on this subject is quite boring. ZB: Way back when, you once said that Morandi would be your last restaurant venture. What made you change your mind? KM: I didn't want to bail out after receiving such a mediocre review from The Times. – Lauren Dru

Chanterelle Goes Vintage

***CONTENT
Chanterelle hosts a Vintage Dinner March 11. David Waltuck, Chanterelle’s chef-owner, is no stranger to culinary history. His cooking at the acclaimed 30-year-old TriBeCa institution is distinguished by its grounding in classic French technique. Those skills will be put to the test on March 11, when he’ll prepare a history-inspired, five-course Zagat Vintage Dinner. With elaborately researched wine pairings by Master Sommelier Roger Dagorn and live performances of 19th-century songs, it should be an evening to remember. The Buzz caught up with Waltuck to talk about what attendees can expect. Zagat Buzz: What are some of the dishes on the menu you’re most excited about? David Waltuck: I love doing quenelles. I’ve put them on the menu many times in different guises. A lot of people won’t order them because they think of it as this flavorless, stodgy, old-fashioned thing. I do mine as a mousseline…fish, egg white and cream. So I think that’s a revelation to people, that they can actually taste good and light. For the amuse-bouche, we’re going to do whitebait, which is something that I happen to really like. I used to occasionally do it as an amuse, and it actually freaks some people out a little bit. ZB: Preferences about seasoning change over time. Are you doing much updating of the dishes for modern palates? DW: Not really. One of the hallmarks of my cooking is intense flavors. I’m assuming that chefs in that time weren’t really shy as far as seasoning. But a lot of classic French dishes have fallen out of favor, with the idea of them being overly heavy. If anything, I’m lightening it up in terms of the weight, but not as far as the flavors. There’s an element of classic cooking that’s always been part of my style. David Waltuck ZB: Did you have a particular inspiration for the menu? DW: A cookbook called The Epicurean. It’s essentially the cookbook by an old chef at Delmonico’s. What I found was a lot of it was very classically French, with a certain level of simplicity. I actually love to do some of those old-fashioned dishes anyway. Not that many people make quenelles anymore or a classic bordelaise or consommé. ZB: What should people expect as far as presentation? DW: We’re going to do as much tableside as possible, which is not something we do much of generally. For the roast beef, our sommelier, Roger Dagorn, loves to do carving tableside, so he’s thrilled to be able to do that. ZB: Are there any other past culinary eras you’d like to explore? DW: I wouldn’t mind going back to the mid-70s [to do] the nouvelle cuisine that was so new then and is now sort of made fun of. But it’s still a very big part of how everybody cooks. ZB: You recently switched to an à la carte menu at Chanterelle. How’s that working out? DW: It’s working out very well. It’s a reaction to the spirit of the times. People don’t necessarily want to commit to a long, more elaborate dinner. They certainly can – there’s still a tasting menu available. We’re just giving them more choices.

Jean-Georges' Market in Atlanta Photo: Lauren Rubinstein for The Reynolds Group Still sporting a tan from a well-deserved vacation, internationally renowned chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten was in Atlanta recently, developing dishes for the upcoming spring menu at Market, which opened last November in the W hotel in Buckhead. “It’s really exciting,” the chef says. “We don’t get anything green before early May in New York. Now I can come here to work on my spring menu early.” One of the recipes Vongerichten is working on is a sophisticated take on Parmesan chicken, which is the kind of dish he hopes will appeal to people during this tough economy. “People want something familiar – new, but familiar,” he says. While conceding that Spice Market in the W Atlanta Midtown, with its difficult upstairs location and eclectic bill of fare, “could be a little busier,” he's working to remedy that with bargain options like a playful bento box lunch as well as a four-course $32 dinner prix fixe. Similar deals are currently offered in his other restaurants around the country. But he also stresses that budget concerns can't overshadow quality: “For me the most important thing during a recession is to make the quality even better. People are tempted to cut corners, but that’s not the solution when you want to nurture your repeat customers.” He anticipates a much-needed “cleansing” of the industry and adds, “People need to look back on how they operate and figure out a way to reinvent things.” The sour economy hasn’t affected his plans for expansion in 2009. Projects in the works include a restaurant in the Mark Hotel here in New York, a Market and a Spice Market in Doha, and a J&G Steakhouse in Washington, DC (the original, which opened in November at the plush Phoenician Resort in Arizona, is “doing well”). He's also excited about Co., the pizzeria where he is an investor along with business partner Phil Suarez. Jim Lahey, who has been baking the bread for the chef’s establishments for more than 15 years, created the pies at the casual, no-reservations restaurant. “It’s more like bread with toppings,” says Vongerichten, who waxes poetic about his favorite, the Popeye, which stars a combination of quality cheeses, garlic oil and a caramelized mountain of fresh spinach. “[Lahey] is brilliant. And Co. is a good answer to the economy these days.” “The hardest part [about this economy] is the fluffing,” he adds, referring to the challenges of sprucing up existing properties to meet the public’s decor expectations. “We have to put things like that on hold. But that’s OK,” Vongerichten laughs. “The whole world is on hold!” – Shelley Sawyer

Vintage Wraps: Le Cirque

***CONTENT
The Vintage Dinner spread at Le Cirque On Tuesday night, Le Cirque chef Craig Hopson took diners back in time. While most of the Zagat Vintage Dinner series have focused on meals from the turn of the century, Hopson and owner Sirio Maccioni went further, presenting a medieval Italian feast that included suckling pig, veal shanks and a bollito misto. We caught up with Hopson for his take on how the evening went. Craig Hopson carves a suckling pig. Zagat Buzz: You looked like you were having a fun time carving the pig at the center of the table. Do you get to do that often? Craig Hopson: No, not at all, but it is fun to do that kind of stuff. ZB: That was a pretty large pig. How long did you cook it for? And what happened to the remains? CH: It came in in the morning and we cooked it for four hours. After the service, the staff devoured it. Just picked over the carcass like vultures. ZB: How did you come up with the menu for the evening? CH: Well, the Maccioni's mostly planned the menu. They went back to their Italian roots and tried to do an Italian version of what a medieval dinner would be – family-style, everyone-serves-themselves kind of thing. The bollito is a peasant dish, but there was also the whole pig with the apples, and the fried pasta dough. ZB: Did you have a favorite dish? Anything that might join the regular menu at Le Cirque? CH: I'm a big fan of the bollito misto – it's like a French pot-au-feu. It's something that we do from time to time here. It doesn't appear on the menu, but we do it as a variable kind of special – like six portions one night here and there. Le Cirque's bollito misto ZB: The herbed lentils were really intensely flavored. How did you cook them? CH: We take bacon, celery, onion, garlic and add the lamb sauce and then sauté them all together and add chicken stock. Then we added a lot of sage, thyme and rosemary – heavy on the sage, especially. It's a rustic Italian take on those lentils. ZB: Are there other time periods that you'd like to explore? CH: I think the classics are classics because they work. So as a chef you take those classic flavors – like potatoes and truffles – and rework them in a modern way. For example I have a brandade on the menu now, which is a classic dish, but I make it lighter. I don't use salted cod, I use fresh cod. And I serve it with a poached egg and truffles. It's a take on a classic dish in a modern sort of way. I'm always exploring the classics like that, just sort of trying to rework it to make it lighter and more appropriate for a fine dining restaurant. Because I don't think people want to have a big bone on the plate here. ZB: Were you happy with the way everything turned out? CH: Oh, yeah, it's very good to get a family-style atmosphere like that with a bunch of strangers around a table. It was like a dinner party from the past.

Joel Dennis Photo: Courtesy of Adour Chef Joel Dennis looked to the golden age of hotel dining while planning last month’s Vintage Dinner at Adour. The chef chatted with the Buzz about the event, expounding on the joys of aspic and the challenges of updating vintage recipes for today’s more health-minded diners. Zagat Buzz: What inspired the menu? Joel Dennis: We revisited turn-of-the-century New York hotel fine dining, something that people might have experienced at a grand social ball at the St. Regis. All the chefs were French at that time, classically trained and followed Auguste Escoffier’s Le Guide Culinaire, which was the French culinary reference point at that time. It was the cuisine of that period. ZB: Were there any techniques you found helpful while preparing the dinner? JD: I particularly enjoyed preparing the Russian aspic of sole fillets – you don’t see aspics anymore, as it is a very passé, time-consuming technique that has been lost through the culinary generations. Exposing my team to such techniques using modern day tools was quite fun. We took the fresh sole, filleted them and made a fresh mousse with the trim from the sole, folding in some lobster, coral and black truffle. We then rolled up the fillets in a pinwheel, poached them in consommé, sliced them very thinly and arranged them in a mold set in gelée. Overall, we adapted the menu using today’s techniques, building on those techniques used in 19th-century kitchens. Roux was very big back then, and we made an effort to lighten the recipes, removing the flour component, making the food less rich. Once upon a time, people ate heartier fare to withstand the winter months as they didn’t have the same heating benefits we have with the push of button today. ZB: Was there anything that people seemed particularly cautious about trying? JD: Not really…During the dinner, I went out into the dining room to speak with some of the guests, who of course travel quite a bit and they just absolutely loved the evening. For them it was the nostalgia of the ‘50s and ‘60s.

Tabla's Floyd Cardoz Photo: courtesy of Tabla Tabla gets “Braised and Brew-tiful” on March 2, when chef Floyd Cardoz will prepare a three-course, beer-paired menu at a special Zagat Presents dinner (space is still available; call 212-889-0667 to reserve). The chef spoke with us about what attendees can look forward to – and clarifies the rumors about a Tabla offshoot. Zagat Buzz: First off, congratulations on being announced as a semifinalist for the James Beard Award nominations. What would it mean to you to win the Best Chef award? Floyd Cardoz: I’ve been nominated five times before and haven’t got it, but if I did, it would mean a lot. It would mean recognition for Indian cuisine, which hasn’t gotten the attention it deserves. It would bring more focus on what we do here. With Slumdog Millionaire winning all those Oscars, it’s brought the focus back to India and I hope it continues. ZB: The event is focused on braised dishes. Is there anything you're serving that you’re especially excited about? FC: There are few things. One is new – I tried it out a few weeks ago and I was so excited with the way it came out. It’s the first course, a braised – and I’m using the term loosely – fennel salad. The salad is braised in bacon fat. I’m very excited about it because I think the flavors of bacon and braising go together very well. The second course is the braised striped bass. Braising fish in India is very common but not very many other cultures braise fish. The last course is a braised oxtail, which has been on our menu every year since we opened. ZB: There’s an educational component to the event. Will you be speaking about braising in general, or will attendees actually learn how to make some of the dishes? FC: I’m going to give some information on braising, and might give some recipes too. Braising is a very misunderstood cooking technique. If it’s used right you can take the most inexpensive cuts of meat – in this economy that helps! – and make something extraordinary. ZB: Speaking of the economy, are you making any changes at Tabla during these tough times? FC: We have reduced our prix fixe from $64 to $59. As far as the menu upstairs, I’m being very creative in trying to keep things on the menu without supplemental charges…And of course we’ve always done prix fixe at lunch – we’re doing a $24 and a $29 prix fixe, which we’ve continued from Restaurant Week. Lastly, we’ve started offering items from the upstairs menu at the Bread Bar. ZB: The other main component of the dinner is beer. What was your approach in picking brews? FC: We are still narrowing down our choices. We have a great selection of beers. There’s a misconception that you need to have Indian beer with Indian food, and what we found is that there are great microbrews all over the country that work with our food. ZB: We read you were opening an offshoot of Tabla – anything more you can say about it? FC: I was misquoted on that. We have spoken about it in the company over the years, but nothing is set in stone yet. In this business you always keep your eyes open for something. I’m not saying it’s going to happen, and I’m not saying it isn’t going to happen.

Per Se's private dining room Photo: Scott Whittle Photography The Zagat Vintage Dinner series rolls merrily along, offering rare history lessons, surprise culinary guests and Rockefeller-inspired dishes. Last Tuesday's dinner at Per Se may have been the most elegant yet. Per Se is renowned for its meticulousness, and the ambiance set for this one-of-a-kind dinner was no exception. The \"room was certainly half the success,\" says chef Thomas Keller, who notes that perfecting the ornate setup was \"probably the most challenging part of the entire meal.\" Harking back to traditional presentation – white-glove service, carving in the dining room, cut crystal glasses – Keller wanted to \"go back to that period of time, when ornate was really what it was all about.\" Guest speaker Tim Zagat described the room as \"absolutely stunning.\" Plush red velvet draped the walls, lush bouquets of flowers adorned the tables and nearly $750,000 worth of silver decorated the space. But amid all that elegance, personal touches gave the evening an intimate feel, which included calligraphed place cards that Zagat deemed fit to \"frame and put on a wall.\" Place settings at Per Se's Vintage Dinner Photo: Scott Whittle Photography For the menu, Keller (along with chef de cuisine Jonathan Benno) strove to \"feature some luxury items – caviar, oysters, lobsters – and use those items in the same way that they had been used at the turn of the century or before.\" In dishes like lobster Thermidor, the chefs married modern ingredients with recipes from the 16th–19th century. According to the four-page menu notes, the pièce de résistance, selle de veau à la Maintenon, was partially inspired by the cooking habits of Madame de Maintenon, the second wife of Louis XIV. “These are dishes that were very popular in the 19th century, and you just don’t see them anymore. But they are delicious,\" Zagat notes, summing up the pleasures of a culinary trip through the past.

Gotham Bar & Grill is lowering its three-course lunch to $25 (regularly $31) for the month of March (which is also its 25th anniversary). The New American is also reviving some of its classic dishes, including duck carpaccio with artichoke salad, lemon oil and Parmesan, for its $75, five-course dinner menu. Meanwhile, Midtown's Picholine is offering a new three-course tasting menu for $58, with each additional plate costing $12.

Carla Hall whips up some love on Top Chef. Photo: courtesy of Bravo Top Chef's Carla Hall surprised many viewers by coming from behind to land a spot in the show's finale, which airs tomorrow night on Bravo. Recently, she chatted with the Buzz about her secret weapon – love – and her plans for the future. Zagat Buzz: Let’s talk about “love” in the kitchen. Does it really matter? Carla Hall: Absolutely. Attitude makes a huge difference. When you put your heart into something, it’s that little special thing that makes a huge difference. Between cooking that is all technique and no heart, cooking with heart will win hands down. Catering is hard work – you’re standing for 18-hour days – so you have to want to make people happy. That passion shows through in the food. Love translates to beautiful food. ZB: As a cooking teacher you talk about layering flavors. Was that a technique you used on the show? CH: [For the oyster and potato stew in the Mardi Gras episode] I started with a base and then started layering. I put in a bay leaf and then took it out, then added some lemon zest for acidity. It’s important to balance all those flavors. That’s what I am thinking about when I cook. What will give me some acid? Some sweetness? When I’m teaching a class, I try to empower people to learn for themselves how to balance a dish to suit their own taste buds. ZB: Let’s talk about the DC restaurant scene. CH: It’s exciting and it’s growing. There are all these new places on 14th Street NW. Diners are growing more sophisticated and willing to try new things. There is so much cooking talent in DC, and they are finding support for second and third ventures like Jamie Leeds’ CommonWealth and Robert Wiedmaier’s Brabo. ZB: Do you want to have your own restaurant? CH: No, I don’t want to start a restaurant. But, I’d like a kitchen of my own, with a chef’s table (to cook for people) and a place to hold cooking classes. And I’d like to retail the sweet and savory cookies that we make for catering customers. ZB: Do you see yourself as a late-bloomer? CH: I didn’t want to be 40 and say, ‘I wish I had.’ Still, I haven’t tried being a race-car driver...yet. I want to do things that make me want to get up in the morning. Success for me is loving what I do, and having people enjoy that thing. – Olga Boikess

Del Posto's elaborate Vintage Dinner setup Photo: Rebecca Klasfeld On February 11, a few dozen diners gathered at Del Posto to enjoy a 19th century–inspired Vintage Dinner prepared by executive chef Mark Ladner, who was recently announced as a semifinalist for the James Beard Awards' Best Chef category. For his nine-course menu, Ladner drew inspiration from Pellegrino Artusi, an Italian silk merchant who in 1891 self-published Science in the Kitchen and the Art of Eating Well, only to have it go on to sell hundreds of thousand of copies and become a staple of Italian kitchens. Ladner spoke with the Buzz about Artusi and some of the challenges he faced in preparing the extravagant feast. Zagat Buzz: Your dinner was inspired by Pellegrino Artusi and specifically his book Science in the Kitchen and the Art of Eating Well. What drew you to him as an inspiration? Mark Ladner: I had already had an interest in the writings of Pellegrino Artusi and the time period fit the request of the event. I’ve referred to this book many times and have borrowed recipes from it on several occasions over the years. ZB: The title of Artusi's book is interesting, especially considering when it was written. Was it tough to find a balance between past and present notions of healthfulness? ML: What most appeals to me is [Artusi’s] interest in wellness and his very straightforward opinions on general health. The refreshing way in which he approaches moderation is very humorous and eloquently stated. I found Artusi’s musing on health and wellness impressively modern and helpful – for the ages! Mark Ladner Photo: courtesy of Del Posto ZB: Did you update the recipes for this dinner? ML: We felt the need to only slightly update the very vague recipes…most are left open to interpretation. The only significant things we omitted were the roux-based sauces. ZB: Were there any ingredients that were hard to procure? ML: Yes, wild hare [used in the Pane de Lepre sandwich]. But it ended up being the most talked-about course of the night, and thus well worth the difficulties. We’re considering serving it on the regular menu. ZB: Did you make any changes to your regular service or presentation style? ML: Fortunately at Del Posto, we have access to a very large supply of different serving plates, silverware, vessels and staff. We did our best to create a sense of a lavish, perhaps even royal, banquet room with silver candelabras enabling us to eat almost entirely by candlelight, setting the table with all nine courses of silverware, and serving and clearing the table (that was set for 30 guests) at once. ZB: What was your approach for the beer and wine pairings? ML: We were trying to establish a feeling of the past, using wines, beers and spirits of the time. Champagne, Madeira and sherry were all very important at the time. And although Chianti and Barolo were available in Italy, their importance in the Italian wine world hadn’t yet reached the levels of importance they have today.

BLT Steak in Atlanta Photo: Our Labor of Love for The Reynolds Group Despite the grim mood blanketing the country, January was a banner month for superstar chef Laurent Tourondel. New locations of BLT Steak opened in Hong Kong and Atlanta, and Miami is slated for March, which will bring the tally to nine. Charlotte is on the 2009 horizon as well. During a visit to oversee the launch of his Atlanta location, which is nestled at the entrance of Downtown's sleek new W hotel, the chef explained why this Southern city made the cut. “It was a combination of the W owners’ enthusiasm about the city and this property and good friends in the business telling me that people here were ready for us.” Tourondel is also comfortable being in the good company of his friend Jean-Georges Vongerichten (who now has two spots in Atlanta) and is inspired by local greats such as Kevin Rathbun (Rathbun’s, Kevin Rathbun Steak, Krog Bar). “He’s a great chef and a super-nice guy. Finding someone like Kevin in Atlanta made a big impact on my decision.” Acknowledging that it’s a rather scary time to open a restaurant anywhere, the chef is optimistic. “I have been very surprised by how busy we have been since opening,” he says. “If we do things right, I think we will be successful here.” Additions to the Atlanta menu play into regional preferences: collard greens, grits and spicy barbecued corn join a plethora of potato choices and vegetables as popular sides. “It’s fun to be able to change the menu,” he says. “We’re also working on a ‘T-bone of halibut’ with different sautés.” Another deviation from the national BLT recipe takes center stage with the steaks, which are broiled first, then roasted with a mantel of garlic butter. “It is very flavorful,” says Tourondel, who might employ this technique elsewhere. After all, there’s nothing like an extra dose of butter to make us all feel better about things.

Here are a choice few: – Not all was as it seemed last night, and one cheftestant's big mistake was left on the editing floor. [Tom's Blog] – Stefan is looking a little big since the break. [Grub Street] – The reunion episode was shot yesterday. [Andy's Blog] – After which the whole cast headed to Tom's Halfsteak for a screening. [Eater] – Followed by drinking at the Beatrice Inn. [Daily Intel] – Except for Fabio, who went to Cain Luxe. [Grub Street] – That quickfire twist was unnecessary. [TONY] – It's Top Chef, not Top Chef Second Chance. [Hungry] – Emeril felt increasingly out of place as the night went on. [VV] – Former cheftestant Spike needs a hand in South Beach. [Amuse-Biatch] – \"Did anyone else think that Padma seemed to be concealing a deep sadness?\" [Gawker] – How long till the Fabio show gets a greenlight?

Where's this year's Box? Photo: courtesy of The Box Fashion Week is winding down, and for the first time in recent memory there was no new ‘it’ club to host the after-parties. Historically, when the tents go up in Bryant Park, the doors open (softly) at some sceney newcomer hoping to build buzz before officially opening: think Pink Elephant and Tenjune in 2006, The Box and GoldBar in 2007, and Apothéke and The Eldridge in 2008. This year, the hottest ticket for the starved-to-perfection set was a pop-up club called Le Baron, spun off from the Parisian original for a limited run in the Bowery Hotel – and put together to shill a new brand of vodka. Not even beautiful people are immune from the effects of the recession. – Curt Gathje

Photo: Rebecca Klasfeld Photo: Rebecca Klasfeld If you haven't been to one of the Zagat Vintage Dinners, get reserving, as they continue until March 25. But if you're on the fence about eating like it's 1909, our report on Blue Hill at Stone Barns' February 5 dinner ought to pique your interest. Guests at the beautiful Pocantico Hills farmhouse kicked off the evening with drinks and passed hors d'œuvres, including deviled quail eggs and steak tartare, before sitting down at a large banquet table covered in silver candelabras, in a private room with windows overlooking the snow-covered grounds. A parade of waiters marched a full loop around the table while holding plates of the first full course, local veal marrow served with American caviar, which they then served in formal banquet style. General manager Philippe Gouze describes the orchestrated service, which the restaurant regularly deploys, as \"a performance ballet.\" When the marrow had been devoured, the bones were removed as elegantly as they had come, only to be followed by the second course, two fist-sized servings of oysters Rockefeller served on a bed of salt and paired with a glass of Pol Roger champagne. The mock-turtle soup Photo: Rebecca Klasfeld Chefs Dan Barber and Josh Lawler introduced the next course, mock-turtle soup made with a whole calf's head and served with a ricotta dumpling. When planning the evening's menu, the duo had studied dozens of menus from old Rockefeller banquets, and the idea of a turtle soup caught their attention. From there, they jumped to making it with a whole calf's head. Per Lawler, the chefs had to \"break the head down, take the brain out, braise the brain separately, braise the head for four hours and then fry the brain.\" All that work wasn't for naught, however, as the end result proved so popular it will likely make a return appearance at the restaurant. Or, as Lawler put it, \"The next time we get a calf's head, I'll know what to do.\" But perhaps the evening's most visually impressive course was the whole suckling pig, brought out on a platter, only to return moments later sliced up on a bed of braised red cabbage with cranberries. To prepare, Lawler cooked a test pig the week before to get the timing just right (\"about four hours,\" he says). The upside of such a massive undertaking? What remained of the pork was used for the staff's family dinner the next day.

Since everyone likes a trip down memory lane we unearthed some of Rutolo's archive for your enjoyment (and possibly the chagrin of his subjects). The toque spotted at right has gone on to become one of the most famous chefs around – thanks in part to a signature catch phrase and an engaging onscreen persona. Not sure who you're looking at? Click through for the answer. Bam! It's Emeril Lagasse, chef, television personality, owner of 10 restaurants and guest judge on the second-to-last episode of Top Chef, airing this week.

Which movie did the Griffith Observatory appear in? Test your knowledge with our movie quiz. Come Sunday, February 22, Hollywood's biggest players will assemble in LA’s Kodak Theatre for the Academy Awards. Afterward, the crème de la crème will gather at the Governors Ball, catered by Wolfgang Puck (see the menu here). To get you in the spirit, we've put together our annual Academy Awards salute, the Zagat Movie Quiz. In past years we tested your knowledge of real-life restaurants and hotels immortalized on celluloid. This year, we're focusing on iconic U.S. attractions and landmarks. Can you match the attraction with the movie it appeared in? Take the quiz. But where to watch the actual show? At halfsteak, Tom Colicchio's new restaurant-inside-of-Craftsteak, the ceremony will be displayed on the restaurant's TVs (212-400-6699; reserve online). (Or for celebrity-spotting of a different kind, head to halfsteak tomorrow night at 9 PM, where you might catch a glimpse of Tom and this season's Top Chef cast having dinner before watching the show.) Down on the Lower East Side, Sonia Rose is not only showing the awards, but also dishing up special nominee-themed food and drinks, including a complimentary Red Carpet Cocktail for all guests (prices still TBD; 212-260-5317; reserve online).

Superstition in the Kitchen

Photo: TooFarNorth In the spirit of the infamously unlucky Friday the 13th, which is making unusual back-to-back occurrences today and next month, the Buzz uncovered some curious superstitions at local restaurants. Chef Scott Bryan of Apiary admits that superstitions are a part of his daily routine. When plating food, Bryan will only add an odd number of, say, asparagus to a dish. “Always three or five of something. Never an even number.” Above all, he does not allow whistling in the kitchen. “It’s bad luck,” he asserts. But Bryan’s not the only one putting the odd-number principle into practice. Jonathan Russell, a bartender at Savoy, observes an old bar tradition by reaching for one or three garnishes when making cocktails for customers. And then there's the dreaded 13. Apparently, it's not just the number missing on elevator panels. According to Corton restaurant director Arleene Oconitrillo, “Most restaurants do not have a Table 13,” including her TriBeCa home base. For others, superstitions have more to do with timing. At Tribeca Grill, executive sous chef Michael Sobelman refuses to shave during Restaurant Week, while over at Porchetta, chef-owner Sara Jenkins tries to set the tone for the rest of the year by ensuring New Year’s Eve operations run as smoothly as possible. But not everyone worries about bad mojo. Savoy's sous chef Jon Katz surrenders superstition for pragmatism. “When it comes to spilt salt,” he says, “I don’t toss it over my shoulder because with a kitchen this small, I’m gonna hit a guy in the face.” – Amy Cao

Know Your Bubbly

With Valentine’s Day just around the corner, it's a good time to talk about champagne, an essential accompaniment for any festive meal. James Hayes, associate beverage director for the Thomas Keller Restaurant Group (and former head sommelier at Per Se), chatted with the Buzz about the basics of bubbly. Zagat Buzz: How did the tradition of drinking champagne to celebrate special occasions get started? James Hayes: Champagne has always been associated with both royalty and luxury, and for good reason. Reims, in the heart of Champagne, houses a famous cathedral where the kings of France throughout history were crowned. Quite obviously they served the wines of the region at the coronation celebrations, giving a start to champagne’s reputation as a wine of kings around the world. ZB: What temperature do you recommend people serve champagne at? JH: Temperature is a very important consideration for all wines and champagnes that is often overlooked. Frequently, I find that some restaurants serve whites too cold and reds too warm – it can really do a disservice to a great bottle. For me champagne is, in most cases, best served cold – about 43–45 degrees. There are certainly exceptions to that approach: some top Tête de Cuvée champagnes and older vintage champagnes will show their best closer to about 52 degrees. At the end of the day, your personal preference is really the only thing that matters. ZB: Does the type of stemware used actually make a difference? JH: The type of stemware does make a difference. The safe play is always a traditional flute, but some champagnes benefit from a larger glass. Jacques Selosse is a champagne producer whose wines are so rich they taste much better in a Chardonnay-style glass. The bigger bowl gives them a chance to breathe and open up – they become much more complex. One consideration to remember is the bubbles. If you like your champagne very bubbly, then stick with a flute – the bigger the glass you use, the faster the carbonation will disappear. ZB: What champagnes do you recommend for celebrating a special occasion? JH: Unfortunately, good champagne is always going to be fairly expensive. For the best values, look to the “multi-vintage” or “non-vintage” blends – these are champagnes that contain wines from a few different years, and typically are produced to showcase a producer’s “house-style.” One of the best values out there is a small producer named Aubry – their multi-vintage brut can typically be had off a restaurant wine list for under $100, which for a top-quality bottle is a good deal. James Hayes Photo: courtesy of Per Se In the midrange, you can step up to vintage-dated champagnes – wines that come from a single year. One of my favorites year in and year out is Pol Roger – they make very pretty, clean and pure champagnes that are great at the start of a meal. If you are looking for a super-special bottle of champagne, there is certainly no shortage of choices. Practically every producer has a Tête de Cuvée or top bottling of champagne in their lineup. For Moët & Chandon, it is Dom Perignon, for Louis Roederer it is Cristal. All the most famous and luxurious champagnes out there fit into this category and they are always very expensive. Everyone has a favorite – mine is Krug’s Clos du Mesnil, a single-vineyard champagne produced from 100% Chardonnay. For me there is no champagne more delicious and more elegant. ZB: With prosecco becoming more popular, do you feel people are becoming less selective about drinking “pure” champagne? JH: Nothing will ever replace true champagne – the soil and climate in [the Champagne] region is simply more perfect than anywhere else for producing great sparkling wine. Other interpretations from around the globe offer a fun, and less expensive, alternative, but most simply do not come close to matching the elegance and complexity found in a great bottle of champagne. ZB: How long can you hold onto an average bottle of champagne before it turns? JH: It depends on the wine and how you store it – some top champagnes can last for 50 years or longer if cellared perfectly. Most multi-vintage champagnes are ready to drink when you get them. I wouldn’t recommend keeping a bottle of one of those around for more than a couple years. ZB: What desserts do you recommend pairing with champagne? JH: Look for similar flavors in your wine and on your plate – for young white champagnes, apple or stone fruit tarts and pastries work great. For rosé champagnes, lighter berry desserts are perfect. For older champagnes, nut- and caramel-based desserts are a nice match. One big no-no is any kind of chocolate – I have found it to be a dreadful pairing with white champagnes especially. ZB: Any tips for popping the cork without breaking a lightbulb? JH: Practice, practice, practice – opening a bottle of champagne perfectly is easier said than done. Try your best to ease the cork out slowly, trying for a “hiss” instead of a “pop.” Intrigued by James' bubbly advice? Sample his approved champagne at Per Se's Vintage Dinner, which recently added seats due to popular demand. Call 212-823-9450 for reservations.

Chile-ing With Sue Torres

Sue Torres Photo: courtesy of Sueños Sue Torres loves chiles and wants you to love them too. On February 16th the chef is teaming up with Zagat Presents to offer a four-course chile feast at her Chelsea Mexican Sueños (7 PM; $55 per person; 212-243-1333; mention \"Zagat Presents\"). Showcasing different varieties and flavors of the fiery fruit, each dish comes with a story about Torres' life and travels: she learned to make the charred jalapeño ranchera sauce (served on a chile relleno) in Morelos, Mexico, while the dessert – a guava and cream cheese empanada with passion fruit and chile de arbol coulis – is a tribute to her grandmother. Torres kicked off her culinary career at Rocking Horse not knowing much about chiles. She says her real education came from \"some great teachers, including Diana Kennedy and Susana Trilling. And of course my [Sueños] chefs' mothers and grandmothers and aunts were always showing me stuff when I was traveling, so I picked up a lot of technique and recipes over there.\" What she learned is going right back into her food. \"What I tried to do with this menu was show off some different preparations of the chile, from dry to wet.\" Want to become a chile expert yourself? Torres is also hosting a cooking class featuring the same menu at Sueños on Saturday, February 21st ($55 per person; 212-243-1333). Click past the jump to see the full menu, annotated by chef Torres. Chile Tasting Menu at Sueños February 16, 2009, 7 PM Chile Relleno, Queso Panela*, Baby Spinach & Pine Nuts, Charred Jalapeño Salsa Ranchera *Queso panela is a superb cow's milk cheese that is seldom used in NYC. Charred Jalapeño Salsa Ranchera is a recipe of Señora Romero from Morelos, Mexico. The ranchera sauce is done by hand in a mocajeta (lava rock bowl), which I'm told by Señora Romero, there is no other way to do it. Sauces are made by hand, as they believe it tastes better that way. Using the machine adds air. Shrimp Panucho, Black Bean, Avocado, Cured Red Onions & Habanero Sauce This dish was inspired by a recent trip to the Yucat án. I was visiting the ancient ruins of Tulum, when I stumbled upon Mercado Suenos, a small restaurant. Habaneros are widely used in the Yucatán, and are the preferred chile of the state. Panuchos are the official snack of the Yucatán, made from fresh-ground corn and cooked to order on a hot comal (griddle). Grilled Filet Mignon Taco, Tomatillo-Corn Salsa & Chile Pulla Sauce The chile pulla sauce was taught to me by Señora Orea from Huajapan de Leon, Oaxaca. She sells a killer pork chile pulla pozole every Sunday, and the locals randomly come to the house to purchase her pozole. Guava & Cream Cheese Empanada, Passion Fruit-Chile de Arbol Coulis The guava empanadas are a tribute to my late great-grandmother, Ramona Rosa Torres. She was a fan of many foods, but always had guava on hand, and I love her for introducing me to it! The passion fruit coulis aside the empanada is infused with chile de arbol.

Canaille Photo: courtesy of the restaurant If you're having trouble snagging a table for Valentine's Day, don't rule out restaurants in Brooklyn and Queens, which aren't always as mobbed as their Manhattan peers. We scouted out some places that still have space for you and yours. Aurora: The Williamsburg Italian still has a few spots available for Valentine's, but only after 10 PM ($65 per person; 718-388-5100). Bussaco: Space is still available at this Park Slope New American for both its three-course early seating (5–6 PM; $50 per person, plus $24 for wine pairings) and its four-course late seating (7–11:30 PM; $65 per person, plus $35 for wine pairings; 718-857-8828; see the full menus here). Canaille: Breaking the mold, this Park Slope bistro is not taking reservations for Valentine's. But they are offering a three-course prix fixe for $45 per person (718-789-8899). Five Front: Go Dumbo for V-Day at this New American where a five-course prix fixe will be available alongside the regular à la carte menu ($65 per person; 718-625-5559). James: There are still a few seats left for this Prospect Heights newcomer's four-course New American tasting menu – though only at the last seating (10:30 PM; $75 per person; 718-942-4255). Jolie: Though this Boerum Hill French isn't offering a prix fixe, it will have its regular menu as well as some \"chef's choices\" available (5–6 PM, 9–11 PM; 718-488-0777). Motorino: The wood-burning oven in the center of the room adds a romantic touch to this Williamsburg pizzeria, where Saint Valentine will be celebrated in four seatings for $30 per person (718-599-8899). Olea: Go Med in Fort Greene at this cozy spot where reservations are still available for the 6 and 10 PM seatings. A holiday three-course prix fixe will be available, along with a limited à la carte menu ($45 per person, $60 with wine; 718-643-7003). PT: This Williamsburg sibling to the D.O.C. Wine Bar is serving a four-course Italian prix fixe (price TBD; 718-388-7438). Water's Edge: Wine and dine with Manhattan as your backdrop (and live piano accompaniment) at this LIC seafooder. Along with the à la carte menu, a special three-course dinner will be available including poached Maine lobster, pan-seared snapper and housemade chocolate truffles with chocolate-dipped strawberries ($85 per person; 718-482-0033).

LA's health-inspection poster Photo: C. Wasilczyk On January 31st, the city announced plans to hire 45 new health inspectors and start displaying letter-based health scores in restaurant windows – à la LA – in July 2010. Chef Daniel Boulud wasn't surprised by the news, saying, \"Everything always comes from California when it comes to health.\" Others, like Sue Torres of Sueños, find it a reasonable demand. \"I think it's great,\" she says. \"Restaurants are serving the public and it is in the diner's best interest to be aware.\" Of course, not everyone agrees. Food Arts editor-in-chief Michael Batterberry thinks the endeavor is \"a little off the rails – as if Woody Allen would be able to voice all of his neuroses, and have them posted in the window.\" However, details of how the new grades will actually be implemented are still being worked out. Among other things, the appearance of the displays, and where they will live, is far from finalized. According to Jessica Leighton, the Deputy Commissioner of Environmental Health, the city is being extra-vigilant in making sure its signs are large, noticeable and simple to understand while at the same time making sure shady restaurant owners can't just \"run a round off in a copy machine.\" And what about the look of the sign? Graphic designer Louise Fili, who just redesigned the Good Housekeeping seal of approval, has aesthetic concerns: \"Already the window or door is being violated with the logo of the restaurant, credit card stickers, the Diners Club... .\" Crafting a sign that conveys all the necessary information but still looks good, may present challenges. For now, the field is wide open. How do you think the city should display restaurant health ratings? Should grades be in colored circles, as on subway lines? Can the signs match the genius of the \"choking victim\" poster? Send us your ideas at buzz@zagat.com and we'll put them up here (and share them with the DOH, natch).

Though the new East Village seafood shack Butcher Bay was rumored to be opening last Friday, at least one report found it closed on Sunday. However, it was open when we stopped by last night, and while we were there, we were told the restaurant has already lost its chef. The restaurant's mailbox is currently full, so we were unable to get further details. Talk about choppy waters (511 E. Fifth St.; 212-260-1333).

It isn't just restaurants that are offering deals to keep the books in the black. Even coffee chains like Starbucks are getting in on the action. Starting March 3rd the chain will offer “breakfast pairings” for $4 and under, available all day. The pairings consist of a tall latte or brewed coffee and one of the store's breakfast items, including two new additions – a bacon and egg frittata with gouda, and one with mild cheddar. This comes on the heels of a 70% decline in profit for the company last quarter.

Cassoulet Photo: courtesy of Savoy Even though we almost broke a high-temperature record this weekend, winter's nowhere near over. Fittingly, a perfect cold-weather dish, cassoulet, will be celebrated at SoHo's seasonal standard Savoy starting next Wednesday, February 18th. To get the ball rolling, The New Yorker's Adam Gopnick will lead a discussion about the history and appeal of the dish during a wine-paired cassoulet meal (6:30 PM; $85 per person including wine; 212-219-8570). Then, from February 19th–March 2nd, the restaurant will serve a Carcassonne-style cassoulet, and from March 3rd–15th, a Toulousian version ($32 at dinner, $25 at lunch). Finally, on Saturday, March 14th, chefs including Ryan Tate and Peter Hoffman (Savoy, Back Forty), Marc Meyer and Joel Hough (Cookshop), Jimmy Carbone (Jimmy's No. 43), Caroline Fidanza (Diner, Marlow & Sons), Matt Weingarten (Inside Park), Galen Zamarra (Mas), Charlie Kiely and Sharon Pachter (The Grocery) will prepare a lunch featuring seven types of cassoulets (12:30–3:30 PM; $55 per person including wine; 212-219-8570).

Vintage Wraps: Daniel

Daniel Boulud Photo: Medilek March The Zagat Vintage Dinner series continued its culinary trip back through time at the legendary Daniel, where, on February 3rd, guests gathered to enjoy a rare feast of 19th-century fare, accompanied by a speech by Michael Batterberry (Food Arts editor in chief) and surprises like a pop-in appearance by Mario Batali. Afterward, the maestro behind the menu, Daniel Boulud, spoke to the Buzz about the event. Zagat Buzz: What inspired the menu? Daniel Boulud: I have been collecting antique cookbooks since I began my first kitchen apprenticeship at age 14. Now the collection fills the shelves of my library with many volumes dating back to the mid-1800s. I turned to the pages of these beautiful old books and combined the inspiration I found there with the incredible ingredients we have at our disposal here today. ZB: After seeing the response to the dinner, are there items you would consider adding to Daniel's regular menu? DB: No, not to the regular menu, but if a customer wants to book a private party to have an encore, that might be possible...We do sometimes serve the “Canard à la Presse” on special request. It requires a few days advance notice due to the two-day marinating period, not to mention the time it takes to special order these exquisite “Peking” ducks from Sonoma. ZB: Was there anything that people seemed cautious about trying? DB: I didn’t go too crazy...The calf’s head was certainly the most daring of all, which was interesting because we used a lot of the parts of the head inside, and it was ragulike. It’s quite unique, not the type of dish you could really put on a menu, but you can do it for special events. ZB: What’s one ingredient or dish from the past that you would like to see on more menus today? DB: I’m so used to using all kind of things, like cockscombs, sweetbread, tongues and innards...But, I think what I would like to see more of is soufflé. We finished with a soufflé, and it is a little bit of a comfort-food dessert, so I think soufflé might come back strong. ZB: How is the progress of DBGB Kitchen & Bar coming along? DB: I always dreamed of having a French-American diner, and I wanted to call it Paris Texas. DBGB will be a little more than that, but it will be very casual and affordable...The restaurant is being designed by Thomas Schlesser (Bar Boulud), and he’s working to evoke some of the Bowery’s history as the city’s traditional industrial restaurant–supply neighborhood but combined with the contemporary aesthetic he’s known for. We are projecting an early- to mid-April opening. In the meantime, we’re busy tasting lots of artisanal beers, which will be a big part of our menu. Not that we won’t serve wine, bien sûr!

***CONTENT
Is the mystery of the maple syrup smell about to be solved? Mayor Bloomberg has just added a last minute 11 AM press conference to his schedule to address the smell, which has been appearing intermittently around New York since 2005. We'll keep you posted but in the meantime you can watch a live feed of the press conference here. Update: And the answer is... The maple syrup smell is a byproduct of a New Jersey factory processing fenugreek seeds. According to Bloomberg, solving the smell \"wasn't exactly akin to finding a needle in a haystack, let's say it was like finding a smell in a very large city.\" Most important, it is in no way a health risk. Read the full press release from the Mayor here.

Fleur de Sel, Cyril Renaud's French in the Flatiron District, is set to close on February 21st after almost 10 years of business. In a statement, Renaud says that \"the economy has forced us to close the restaurant for financial reasons. Though I am saddened to have to close Fleur de Sel, I am very proud of what we've done – and I am confident that my new restaurant, Bar Breton will be a better fit for this economy, offering customers a casual spot for breakfast, brunch, lunch, and dinner.\"

La Fonda del Sol Photo: Evan W.

Photo: courtesy of Jerry Rutolo Over the years photographer Jerry Rutolo has photographed nearly every major chef you can think of, many before they even lost their baby fat. Since everyone likes a trip down memory lane we thought it would be fun to unearth some of Rutolo's archive for your enjoyment (and possibly the chagrin of his subjects). The toque spotted to the right helped pioneer Californian cuisine and runs one of LA's perennial hot spots. Here he is pictured at a Citymeals-on-Wheels event in New York's Rockefeller Center in May, 1993. Not sure who you're looking at? Click through for the answer. It's Wolfgang Puck, the man behind Spago. Want to find out more about Puck? Check out our newly updated chef bios.

Just in time for Valentine's Day, Zagat Survey has forayed into dating. Our first-ever New York City Dating (and Dumping) Guide covers everything from intimate bars to morning-after brunches to restaurants that offer couples-friendly activities (like cooking classes at Bouley, CamaJe and Carol's Cafe). But it's not all hearts and flowers, as the guide also provides suggestions for those in the throes of a breakup, whether it's dessert spots to end things on a sweet note or meat markets to get that rebound relationship started. And what would a survey be without eye-opening statistics, like the fact that most New Yorkers are more likely to date outside their nationality, income bracket, religion and race than outside their political party, or that many city-dwellers refuse to date someone outside the metro area? Don't cry, New Jersey, we know just the spot to mend your broken heart!

In an effort to create a safer dining experience, on Saturday Mayor Bloomberg and Deputy Senate Majority Leader Jeff Klein announced a new health inspection program requiring restaurants to display their results in the form of letter grades. Based on a system already in place in LA, the program will give restaurants A, B or C grades depending on the number of infractions received. The better the grade, the less frequently that restaurant will be inspected, meaning A-grade establishments will be looked at yearly, while B grades will receive two inspections per year and C grades will receive three follow-up checks. Realizing the toll this system will take on New York eateries, not to mention on health inspectors, the city plans to phase it in over the next two years. Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, the city's health commissioner, hopes to hire 45 more inspectors to help move forward with the new system. Think you have what it takes? Keep an eye out here for job notices.

Aquavit will be extending its Restaurant Week menu. Photo: Noah Kalina Technically, the winter round of Restaurant Week ends today, January 30th. In reality though, 2009 is shaping up to be a Restaurant Year for many establishments, with more and more prix fixe lunch and dinner deals stretching out well into February and beyond. To that end, the website Wined & Dined has begun compiling an epic list of places that are extending their deals (21 Club, Aquavit, Compass, Le Cirque, Sushisamba, Vong), and ones that aren't (Del Posto, Eleven Madison Park, The Modern). Our additions to their list include Centrico, Icon (featuring four courses instead of the usual three), Mai House, Nobu, Nobu, Next Door and the Tribeca Grill, which are keeping their Restaurant Week menus till February 27th, while Benoit is running its menu till February 12th. Know of any restaurant week extensions that have been overlooked? Drop us a line at buzz@zagat.com.

This photo finds him in the kitchen of the long-lost New York outpost of Paris' Maxim's in 1987. Can you name that toque? Click through for the answer. That right there is Daniel Boulud. Want to see what the chef looks like these days? His restaurant's Zagat Vintage Dinner at Daniel on February 3rd still has a few open seats.

Top Chef, Season 5, Episode 10. Photo: Courtesy of Bravo TV. Each Thursday the Internet's food sites produce countless recaps and commentary on the previous night's episode of Top Chef. Here are a choice few: – Is New York ever going to play a part in this season? [Grub Street] – And who thinks \"oats\" when they hear \"Super Bowl\"? [Best Week Ever] – Lovely how neither of this year's Super Bowl teams were repped last night. [Eater] – Tom Colicchio didn't quite agree with the term \"All-Stars.\" [Tom's Blog] – Does Scott Conant \"hate wops\"? [Gawker] – Is the Top Chef Bowl a dig at that other non-Chopped cooking show Ted Allen appears on, Iron Chef? [Hungry Mag] – Former cheftestants Andrew and Spike were on TV and Twitter at the same time. [Twitter] – Gordon Ramsay is not much of a fan of Top Chef. [Eat Me Daily] – A winning prediction? [Amateur Gourmet] – Really, it is going to take a solid decade to get over that loss? [Defamer]

Artisanal's getting some West Coast cousins. photo: courtesy of Artisanal Terrance Brennan announced today that he's bringing his ever-popular Murray Hill brasserie Artisanal to the West Coast. Artisanal Brasserie & Wine Bar and The Artisanal Table, Pizzeria Tapas Wine Bar are slated to open in Bellevue, WA, in September. We talked to Brennan about the expansion, how he's making sure his New York outposts survive the tightening economy, and Picholine's new \"menu d'economie,\" which offers half-portion entrees and three-course tasting flights for $20 each. According to Brennan the plan for the new restaurants \"started awhile back. The Artisanal Table is the right concept and price point for these times, and we're still very busy at Artisanal in New York – we recently launched our grilled cheese bar there.\" The menu at the Washington newcomers will be similar but will \"obviously be influenced by the Northwest's fabulous ingredients: the shellfish, seafood, produce, wineries and microbreweries.\" Regarding Picholine's new menu d'economie, Brennan says, \"We didn’t want to just all of sudden start serving bistro food at Picholine, so this way someone can still come in and order two half portions and a glass of wine and get out for 50 bucks...that’s a good deal! It isn’t about making money. It’s about surviving and keeping the restaurant buzzed and full...We’re still a special occasion restaurant, we still do 16-course tasting menus, we still do 12-course tasting menus, we still do the game menu. But in addition to all of that, we do smaller portions of our food. But it is still the highest quality food.\" Though previously only offered in the cheese and wine bar, the menu d'economie is now being served in the dining room after 9 PM (or before 9 PM, if you make same-day reservations Monday–Thursday). In addition, the restaurant has also launched a Monday night wine special that offers any bottle of wine priced $150 or less at half price.

As we previously announced, the Norwegian team (headed by 28 year-old Geir Skeie) took home the gold, with €20,000 and the pictured trophy. Finishing in second and third place respectively were the Swedish and French teams. Despite a valiant effort, the Americans finished sixth (which, it should be noted, is better than the team has done in the past two competitions).

The Times noted yesterday that the popular Chelsea Jamaican joint Maroons is closing its doors on January 31st. Gone as well are dreams of opening a Harlem outpost (in the works since 2005). Meanwhile, the owners are looking to relocate to a new space in the future and plan to market a line of gourmet sauces. The closing of Maroons also points to what could be the trend of the year: expired leases. Part of the reason for Maroons shuttering, we hear, is that its 10-year lease has come to a close. In the same vein, the recently closed Upper West Side Ruby Foo's was at the end of its decade-long lease. Sadly, we expect this trend to continue as the year rolls on.

But what about the brews? If you want to sample some local flavor, Six Points Craft Breweries will be in the Whole Foods Beer Store over the weekend with samples of different beers and growlers \"priced to sell.\" Finally, if you're looking to watch the game somewhere else than your living room, check out our list of the city's Top Sports Bars.

Today came the news that the venerable 21 Club will no longer refuse service to the tie-less. But before you start writing requiems for a bygone era, we'd remind you that the restaurant still prefers that men wear a tie and insists they wear a jacket. And, unlike younger spots like, say, Balthazar, a phone call confirms that the venerable Midtowner still employs bathroom attendants.

Terrance Brennan photo: courtesy of Picholine On January 21st, Picholine hosted the third night in the Zagat Vintage Dinner series. Chef Terrance Brennan talked to the Buzz about the event, which found him deconstructing oysters Rockefeller, cooking a whole leg of beef and adding vintage dishes to Artisanal's menu. Zagat Buzz: How did the dinner go? Terrance Brennan: The customers were really, really into it, especially the beef. It was just roast beef, really, not dry-aged Wagyu or anything, but they were just flipping out over it. And the lobster Americaine. I put a glaçage on it – like hollandaise with whipped cream on it – and they just ate it up. ZB: Was there anything that people seemed particularly cautious about trying? TB: Maybe some of the amuses I did I might have gone a little nouveau on. I did oysters Rockefeller, deconstructed, and I did a kidney and lamb heart kebab since they ate a lot of organ meats then. Many were a little weary of that...Everyone ate everything. No one wanted substitutions, and they really enjoyed it. I was in the dining room carving the haunch of meat and they loved that. People were taking photographs. Nobody’s seen a big hunk of meat like that sliced tableside. ZB: What inspired the menu? TB: I went online and researched the ingredients of the time. Back when I worked in a hotel, when I was like 22 years old, we used to do these steamship rounds for banquets. And so that was in my memory bank when I was looking to do something big and over-the-top in the dining room. ZB: Were any of the dishes hard to procure? TB: Well, I had to preorder the haunch of meat. Here’s the story: it was like 75 pounds, so there was a lot of carryover cooking involved. I got one in the week before to cook it and time the carryover cooking...That worked out perfect, but the haunch wasn’t long enough with all of the garnishes, so I asked the butcher to give us more bone the next time. But when it came in on Monday, the butcher cut the bottom too low. We had to scramble and had to really pressure our purveyor to get us another one that wasn’t so low – which is tricky since it was all special order. We practiced again with the short one. It worked perfectly, and then we just fed it to the staff. ZB: Do you plan on incorporating any of the dishes into your regular menu? TB: Absolutely. The baked Alaska! The inside is vanilla ice cream and passion fruit sorbet, so it's like a creamsicle. It got such a huge response, and since it isn’t quite refined enough for Picholine, it's going on the menu at Artisanal.

Tim and David’s Excellent Adventure

Tim Zagat and David Fishman photo: Evan W. Miller Tim Zagat hardly lacks for interesting dining companions, but his tablemate at a recent power lunch – an ambitious young food critic with a possible movie deal under his belt – was unusually notable. The critic in question is David Fishman, the 12-year-old Manhattanite who’s become something of a celeb thanks to a New York Times story detailing his restaurant-reviewing exploits – and noting his desire to someday write for Zagat. Never one to miss a chance to schmooze a promising recruit – even one who still gets around town by scooter and brings his mom (Pam) to meetings – Tim extended a let’s-get-acquainted invite, which for Tim usually involves a meal. David was subsequently inspired to review not just their lunch (at Jean Georges) but his entire day “behind the scenes at Zagat.” Some highlights: “Scootering from home up to 4 Columbus Circle, I was thrilled by the thought that within the next half hour I would be sitting in an office with Nina and Tim Zagat.” (We can relate, since that’s pretty much how the staff feels every day!) David and his mom discussed “tons of ideas with the Zagats” – ranging from David’s omelet-making skills to whether it’s important for a critic to remain anonymous – and then toured the offices, where David observed “many people typing up g-d knows what.” (An eerily accurate description of the scene here in Editorial.) Speaking of anonymity, David might want to change his mode of transport and choice of companion: “I head out on my scooter with Tim and my mom to Jean Georges. … We were immediately recognized as ‘the people with Tim Zagat.’” (Next time it may be the reverse.) David’s take on the Nougatine/Jean Georges dichotomy: “There’s a fancy part and an even more fancy/expensive part. We sat in the more fancy part and I immediately knew it was a mistake.” But only because Jean Georges’ prix fixe offers “two dishes for $28” (dessert not included) while Nougatine’s offers “three dishes for $24,” with dessert. (Hey David, I think Tim could afford the extra outlay for dessert.) David was impressed by the arctic char (“I was hit by the tastes all at once … the restaurant’s best dish”) and deemed the scallops “nicely cooked and browned.” But he found portions small: “Three scallops … gone in less than a minute.” Then came “Tim Zagat’s favorite part, dessert.” David was duly impressed by JG’s famous chocolate cake: “I touched it with my fork and swoosh, the hot melted chocolate inside came pouring out. … Wow, this stuff was majestic.” (Tim skipped it due to a diet, or at least that was his intention …) And on that note, David scootered home to plan future restaurant outings (Vegas, we hear, was on the agenda).

Or was Tom, Toby or Stephan?

There are worse fans to have than the police commissioner. While covering the inauguration festivities in DC, Greg Kelly (NYPD Commissioner Ray Kelly's son and Good Day New York co-host) got a hankering for a hamburger and pulled into a McDonald's. While there he witnessed a customer go berserk, throwing things before storming out. Kelly called 911 and followed the perp to a nearby watering hole where he was promptly apprehended. The elder Kelly was reportedly proud of his son, but took issue with his restaurant choice, saying, \"Next time, consult Zagat's.\" So, Greg, if you're out there, don't do any more crime-fighting without first browsing our list of DC's Top Burgers.

President Obama has been sworn in, and the Lincoln-themed Inaugural Luncheon is finishing up. Ted Kennedy, who collapsed during the meal, is reportedly going to be fine. And if you're wishing this memorable moment in our country's history could last a little longer, it can, at your own house, now that recipes for the entire meal have been put online (according to Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the most viewed page on the official inauguration website). The site also offers even more memories to chew on, via videos from past Inaugural Luncheons going all the way back to JFK (RealPlayer required).

La Fonda del Sol Rises Again

***CONTENT
By Jacqueline Wasilczyk, ZAGAT.com staff editorThe Patina Restaurant Group hopes its reincarnated La Fonda del Sol shines.Nick Valenti, chief executive officer of Patina Restaurant GroupPhoto: Courtesy of Patina Restaurant Group The relaunch of iconic '60s restaurant La Fonda del Sol has its soft opening tonight, followed by a grand opening on the 26th. Zagat Buzz spoke to Patina Restaurant Group’s chief executive, Nick Valenti, about the Restaurant Associates original, the 21st-century update and what else 2009 has in store. Zagat Buzz: La Fonda del Sol roughly lasted from 1961 to 1971. Why revisit the concept? Nick Valenti: First of all, it was a time during which I first joined Restaurant Associates, and [La Fonda del Sol] was one of the company’s icons. People did not understand Spanish food at that point, but they embraced the idea of eating casually. Having spent my entire career at the company [Restaurant Associates bought Patina Group in 1999], I thought this would be a tribute to the early years. The whole notion of Spanish food, ingredients and tapas has become quite mainstream. Often you find [tapas] in little bars, so we’re formalizing it a bit and elevating the quality. A look at the original spacePhoto: Courtesy of www.lafondadelsol.net ZB: Was the design inspired by Alexander Girard’s original? NV: The original was unique, and it very much represented the ‘60s. It was iconic, and our approach was not to try competing with that. We do pay tribute to the original design with the logo work, and a lot of the interior design does refer to the [classic] sun shape. The original graphics were extraordinary examples of folk art, and what we’ve done this time is a much more clean and contemporary design. [It's] very much a Spanish version of an approachable brasserie or trattoria. We wanted something that would have broad appeal, and we bridged the gap [by creating] two parts. It has an informal, brightly colored bar room, which is more of a tribute to what happened in the ‘60s, and a more conservative dining room that’s a little plusher, quieter and will be somewhat more expensive, but priced for the current environment. The spaces are split on two levels. The dining room is up four or five risers, so there’s a bit of a see-and-be-seen element, versus the bar room, which is in the open and spills into the street. The new restaurant's private roomPhoto: Tanja Yokum ZB: What should diners expect from Josh DeChellis’ “modern Spanish” menu? NV: When we joined forces several months ago, we sent him to Spain’s Basque region, where he worked with several chefs, like Martín Berasategui, who are producing some of the best food. We liked Josh’s eclectic background, and thought his food was quite extraordinary. He’s committed to his food; he wants people to enjoy eating and loves hospitality, which comes out in the quality of [his dishes] and presentation. ZB: With the economy, are you making any special plans to keep things affordable? NV: Obviously we didn’t pick the timing; these projects are a long time in the making. [But] conceptually, given that tapas are a big [part] of the menu, the restaurant is very affordable...you can eat as inexpensively or expensively as you’d like. Dishes are going to start around $4.50, ranging to a dish that’s $12 to $14. You can really mix and match. ZB: B.R. Guest restaurants just announced a few closings. Is the Patina Restaurant Group facing similar pressures for 2009? NV: We’re not immune to what’s going on in the economy, but we’ve always placed a premium on delivering high-quality foods at the right price, and we’re continuing to do that. We don’t have restaurants we’re considering shuttering at the moment, but we’re being careful and watching our Ps and Qs because customers are thinking twice before [deciding] where to [eat]. We’ve been fortunate that the majority of our restaurants are moderately priced, and we’ll continue to keep value in that equation. We are excited to be developing Patina at Lincoln Center, which will open fall 2010. ZB: How will it compare to its LA namesake? NV: The setting will be certainly one of a kind. It’s going to be glass-walled on four sides, and the roof will be a grass field. People will be able to take picnic boxes on the field prior to a performance, which will be a very informal way of dining. Inside will be an upscale, premium-style restaurant. It will have around 100 seats, maybe a few less, and will be totally different from what we do at Patina. Certain signature elements, like the extraordinary cheese cart and 20,000–bottle wine list will carry over, but we want this to be something new and inspired, and we are auditioning chefs as we speak.

Shindler's Dish: Aye Cuy-rumba!

Cuy, otherwise known as your childhood pet. photo: Merri Howard In Lima, Peru, local foodies ecstatically describe the wonders of the Nouvelle Andean cuisine of local culinary powerhouse Gastón Acurio (who recently opened a restaurant in San Francisco), the Italian cooking of Ugo and Sandra Plevasani, and the wonders of the Central Market, where on any given day a sizable portion of the estimated 3,000 species of local fish can be found for sale. By contrast, in Cusco – an hour away by plane, and 12,000 feet higher – what the local eaters speak of, with near-religious fervor, is cuy (pronounced \"coo-wee\"), otherwise known as the guinea pig. Peruvians eat an estimated 65 million of the rodents a year, and it's a good guess that the majority is eaten in the countryside outside of Lima. Should anyone have doubts about the obsession Peruvians have for guinea pig, spend a moment studying the mural depicting the Last Supper in Cusco's Plaza de Armas – look carefully, and you'll discover that Jesus and his disciples are dining on platters of guinea pig. (I've checked through my New Testament, and feel fairly sure that no mention is made of guinea pig being served as the main course. Or as a side course.) On a recent trip to Peru, I had eaten my fill of ceviche in Lima – it was clearly time to give guinea pig a try in Cusco. At a small, second-story cafe called A Mi Manera, hidden in the back of a shopping complex, while my wife and 10-year-old daughter chewed on alpaca steak and pasta, I went for the cuy. Which arrived in a state of…\"cuy-ness\" that left us all a bit breathless. And not just because we were two miles up. Unfortunately, my Spanish isn't quite good enough for me to have noticed that the guinea pig was served \"qua\" – roasted, and served whole, with the head on one end, the tail bud on the other and, in between, the four legs sticking up in the air. It looked like a cartoon rodent that's been bopped on the head – all that was missing were Xs for eyes. There was no denying the guinea pig-ness of the guinea pig, no mistaking it for, say, chicken or even rabbit. I looked at it for a while, unsure how to dive in. And my server, noticing my confusion, offered to take it to the kitchen to prepare it further. Which sounded like a great idea, until it came back dismembered – the head and feet were separated from the corpus, which itself had been cut into six parts. This did not make it look any better. Nor did it help when my waiter pointed out that the best part was the head – the brains, he told me, were particularly succulent. Oh. So, how was it? Well, I'm not going to say it tasted like chicken. Nor am I going to say it was a cross between gerbil and hamster, with a hint of ferret. Instead, it was a boney thing, with a crispy skin that was decently porkish, and a smattering of meat within that was notable for its greasiness. I passed on the head, though I did annoy my wife by pretending that the head was speaking (\"Eat me! Eat me!\"). It gave me bragging rights as well – probably for the rest of my life. But unlike much of what I experienced in Peru, I don't dream of my next cuy. As the old pun goes, \"One egg is an oeuf.\" – Merrill Shindler, Zagat Editor, LA

Steve Feinberg of Speedball Fitness The new year ushers in a slew of resolutions, with the pledge to revamp eating habits a frequent list-topper. For advice on how to watch waistlines but still enjoy eating out, we asked three fitness instructors for their strategies as well as favorite restaurants where they put them into practice. Steve Feinberg, the founder of Speedball Fitness, warns against speed when it comes to eating. “It’s better to eat slowly so that your stomach has time to register that it’s full.” He also suggests focusing on protein and vegetables while avoiding overly processed foods. “I am always aware of what I’m eating,” he says, but stresses that being conscious of what you eat shouldn’t translate into being anxious about what you eat. Feinberg’s favorites include NoHo’s Quartino for its light Italian plates prepared with vegetables and seafood; the “extremely tasty” vegan fare at Pure Food and Wine in Gramercy Park; Back Forty in the East Village for fresh, locally sourced ingredients and organic beers; and Whole Foods for its variety of healthy grab-and-go snacks and meals. Kristi Molinaro, who heads Equinox gym’s 30/60/90 high-intensity interval training class, knows that it’s a challenge to eat healthfully while keeping up a demanding schedule. “I don’t want to eat before teaching class, but when you’re teaching numerous classes a day, you end up not eating much and having things like coffee instead. When you get home, you’re ravenous so you eat all the wrong stuff.” Her solution? “Think like an athlete…you have to keep your blood sugar stable, and you need to eat a small meal every three hours,” she advises. Kristi Molinaro Some of her favorite stops include Bread on Spring Street (“the best tomato soup”), the Upper West Side’s Gennaro for its manageable portion sizes, and Woo Lae Oak, a SoHo Korean barbecue spot, where you can add sauces – and extra calories – at your discretion. Finally, even if you're watching your weight you can still enjoy foods that aren't typically thought of as particularly diet-friendly. Patricia Moreno, founder of intenSati, likes vegetarian fare from her favorite restaurants Josie’s and Gobo, but she’s also able to maintain her dietary focus at Mexican restaurants like Rosa Mexicano by skipping the chips, cheese and sour cream while sticking to grilled meats and protein-laden fajitas. And she wouldn’t turn down a good T-bone either. Her secret? Share the steak and sides of grilled vegetables with dining companions. – Amy Cao

After being sworn in next Tuesday, President-elect Barack Obama will lunch on a menu designed in honor of President Lincoln that includes 1860s fare like seafood stew in puff pastry and a brace of pheasant and duck. If you're not invited to that meal, you can get a similar taste of the past at Zagat Vintage Dinners, which started last night and continue on Thursday, January 15th, at the new Bouley. Obama may be dining on replicas of Lincoln's china in the company of Supreme Court justices, but at the Bouley dinner, you'll enjoy five courses of 19th-century classics with the likes of Tim and Nina Zagat. To reserve, call 212-964-2525. Can't attend the Bouley evening? Fret not, the series continues through March.

City Winery photo: Evan W. Miller Unlike anything else in town, City Winery, a mammoth new winery/eatery/performance space in West SoHo, not only stocks an extensive selection of global wines but also makes its own vino on-site – and offers a program that allows oenophiles to purchase their very own barrel. Spread out over two levels, the 21,000-sq.-ft. space encompasses two bars, a stage, a tasting table, a private room and a vast wine cellar, all fashioned from acres of blond wood. Full-fledged dining is still in the works, but for the time being small plates come courtesy of Murray’s Cheese and a Sunday klezmer brunch is up and running. As for the musical talent, the well-curated lineup of artists (think Suzanne Vega, Philip Glass, Rufus Wainwright, Marianne Faithfull) should come as no surprise: owner Michael Dorf was the founder of the Knitting Factory. 155 Varick St.; 212-608-0555 See more new nightlife in New York City Winery photo: Evan W.

The spectacle that is the Rainbow Room has gotten even showier. Five days after the embattled Cipriani family, which runs the Room, announced they would be shuttering the adjoining Rainbow Grill, the company's landlord Tishman Speyer has kicked them to the curb, the New York Times reports. The dispute seems to come down to millions of dollars worth of back rent, since September 2008, which Tishman Speyer claims it's owed. The Ciprianis, who are fighting the eviction, reportedly have three days to leave the space and Speyer is seeking \"another great restaurateur to operate the space in the first-class manner that New Yorkers and visitors deserve.\"

[Eat Me Daily] – There sure was a lot of sugar in that no-sugar challenge. [The Stew] – \"Jamie, of the insipid scallop preparations, is becoming increasingly insufferable.\" [Grub Street] – New judge Toby Young is \"like Simon Cowell without the talent or the hair.\" [Eater] – Though some thought that Young was \"nasty in the best of ways.\" [Serious Etas] – This 30-second recap is brought to you by Diet Dr. Pepper. [Hungry Mag] – And for what it's worth, former cheftestant Spike Mendelsohn loves the \"Toby Young show.\" [Twitter] – Exit interviews, anyone? [Endless Simmer, The Feedbag]

Obama, Critic-in-Chief?

***CONTENT
Good thing Barack Obama kept his day job. Back when he was a young state senator in 2001, Obama participated in the first episode of Check, Please!, a Chicago public television program in which a group of locals compare notes on restaurants. But our president-elect's episode wound up on the cutting room floor since the producers felt he wasn't \"amateur\" enough (take that, Ms. Palin!). The footage was never used – until now. WTTW will air it January 16th on the show's 100th episode. In the meantime, you can enjoy Obama waxing on about Chicago’s Dixie Kitchen & Bait Shop – one of the city's Top Cajun-Creoles according to our survey – thanks to the wonders of the internet: The rest of the video, and more Obama food news, after the jump. Speaking of Obama and food, a decision still has not been made regarding the 44th president's White House chef (though we keep hearing whispers about Art Smith of Chicago's TABLE fifty-two and DC’s Art & Soul). That role, as our own Tim Zagat notes today on the Huffington Post, could easily be transformed into a \"culinary impresario\" who can help reshape the way Americans eat. On the other hand, we could all just go to Ben & Jerry's – for the month of January, the company will sell \"Yes Pecan\" ice cream with proceeds going to Common Cause's Education Fund.

Klee photo: Courtesy of Klee Sunday dinner is a grand old tradition, and one that cash-strapped restaurants would really like you to celebrate with them this season. To that end, two restaurants have just come out with Sunday dinner specials to entice you through their doors during the cold month of January. In Chelsea, New American Klee Brasserie is getting in on the act with a \"Sunday Night Resolution\" tasting menu, featuring shaved Brussels sprouts and radicchio salad, free-range chicken with winter vegetables and an almond and olive oil cake with yogurt sorbet and applesauce finished off with a pot of green tea (Sundays in January; $39 per person; 212-633-8033; reserve online). Meanwhile, at David Burke's Fishtail, Sunday offers a three-course dinner for a mere $20.09 for the rest of the month (that's $14.91 bucks cheaper than its Restaurant Week dinner). The menu will vary each week but currently includes corn-and-scallop chowder, calamari mac 'n' cheese, Maine lobster carbonara, coconut panna cotta and mini doughnuts (212-754-1300).

The Times reported yesterday that Smith Street trailblazer Patois is planning to close shop on Sunday after 31 years in business. But that isn't the whole story. The popular bistro's owners tell us they are hoping to move the restaurant across the street later this month from its current digs at 255 Smith St. to 254 Smith St. with a planed reopening in mid-February.

After a year-long hiatus the mysterious maple syrup–like smell (first sniffed way back in 2005) has reportedly returned to the shores of Manhattan, especially, it seems, to the Upper East and West Sides. And though there's still no official explanation for what exactly is producing the smell, with all of that sugary scent in the air, all we can think about is where to go to eat breakfast. From the 2009 New York City Restaurants survey, here's our list of the Top Breakfast spots in town: Balthazar Bubby's Clinton St. Baking Co.

Achatz and Keller: A Tale of Two Chefs
***AUTHOR
BuzzEditor
***DATE
2009-12-24 00:00:00
***CONTENT
By Michael Nagrant Thomas Keller and Grant Achatz might be battling it out for their share of the cookbook market (one report says Achatz’s Alinea is handily outselling Keller’s Under Pressure), but the mega chefs have nothing but the highest regard for each other professionally – even after collaborating on a recent series of ultralavish “Mentor-Protégé” dinners that could easily have led to ego clashes and chef-knife rattlings. Here, they talk to the Buzz about their working relationship and how they approached the dinners, the last of which was held this month at Keller’s French Laundry. Grant Achatz From Ramblin’ Jack Elliott and Bob Dylan to Obi-Wan Kenobi and Luke Skywalker, the list of mentor-protégé relationships is long. A rarity, though, is to have both parties at the top of their game at the same time, a situation that can lead to jealousy, insecurity and worse. But that’s not the case for Thomas Keller and his onetime protégé Grant Achatz. The duo has managed to maintain a collegial harmony, culminating in a series of $1,500, 20-course “Mentor-Protégé” dinners held over the past two months to celebrate the publication of Keller’s cookbook Under Pressure and Achatz’s Alinea. Of course, it took time for the relationship to evolve. When Achatz first arrived at The French Laundry, “he was certainly a subordinate,” says Keller. “He worked to become somebody we collaborated with, and as he became more proficient, he had a significant impact.” Now they view each other as colleagues. “It reminds me of [the late chef] Jean-Louis Palladin, someone I admired from afar,” says Keller. “When he became a colleague, it made me proud that I reached that level – maybe not that level, but one where I could have a conversation with him.” Likewise, Achatz – who named one of his sons Keller – says their collaboration “has been very rewarding in that it makes me realize that I have made it to some degree.” In fact, he sees it as more legitimizing than all of his media accolades and awards. “Thomas Keller is a very thoughtful and deliberate person,” Achatz notes. “He wouldn’t do [these dinners] at this level and charge this price if his wingman wasn’t worth the price of admission.” But, he adds, “I am still the grasshopper, of course. He is still the man.” Thomas Keller The deference that each shows the other has roots in the lessons of Keller’s mentor, chef Roland Henin. “More than any cooking technique or life lesson he ever taught me is that the most important thing I do as a chef is nurture people,” says Keller, adding: “My feeling is more like being a father … It’s someone you saw as a youngster and you have an overwhelming pride when they succeed. Our role is not to break down or ignore the next generation, but to nurture it.” Even so, there’s a lingering bit of the old sous-chef/executive chef relationship. During the first collaborative dinner at Per Se in New York on November 11th, Achatz recalls getting a bit vocal with the service team and “cracking the whip” when Keller telegraphed with his eyes that Achatz needed to tone it down. Achatz says, “I know that look, so I shut up.” Their collaborative success is not wholly about deference. They also share a similar work philosophy. Of Achatz, who famously sent his résumé to the French Laundry almost every day for a month until he got a job, Keller says, “He had so much tenacity, much the same way I was persistent about my goals and what I wanted to do.” And on the plate, they’re both very concerned with appealing not only to the palate, but the heart and brain as well. That approach was evident during their collaborative dinner series. Achatz and Keller spent weeks discussing how to achieve a balance between their cuisines, and it showed in the results. For example, during the collaborative dinner at Alinea on December 2nd Achatz’s silky potato truffle soup – aka Hot Potato, Cold Potato – was followed by Keller’s pumpkin soup topped with sea urchin sabayon and black truffle purée, aka Jacobsen’s Farm Musquee de Provence soup. Though they looked nothing alike, both dishes were very comparable studies in temperature and textural contrast. Probably the most significant explanation of their shared success, though, is found in their differences. Keller celebrates simplicity (though the execution of his cuisine is by no means simple) in his pursuit of taste perfection, while Achatz often embraces complexity while striving for perfection. The best part about their recent collaboration was that for three nights, diners lucky enough to attend didn’t have to make a choice between those philosophies but simply got to enjoy the fruits of both.

The Cipriani family troubles aren't relegated to the New York State Liquor Authority – they're having trouble across the pond as well. The London branch of Cipriani may have to change its name after losing a trademark battle with the Orient-Express Group, owners of the Hotel Cipriani in Venice. The High Court’s decision means that Arrigo and Giuseppe Cipriani, son and grandson of the founder of the famous hotel, may be prevented from using their own name in the UK unless the family wins an appeal – go figure!

Inauguration Survival Guide

***CONTENT
photo: DennisInAmsterdam Come January 20th, all eyes will be on Washington, DC, where the historic inauguration of President-elect Barack Obama will take place. The festivities crank into gear January 16th and run through Inauguration Day, culminating in numerous balls and galas held throughout the city. Bonus: a lot of the events are free. Sure, it’ll be crowded (more than a million people may stream into the capital for the event) and most likely chilly (the average high for the date is about 42 degrees, according to the Weather Channel). But with a bit of planning, patience and, for visitors, proper packing (many activities are outdoors), you can have a memorable experience watching history unfold. To that end, here’s some information on what to expect, along with links to helpful websites. Destination DC, the city’s tourism arm, has a mountain of material on its website, including the latest on concerts, transportation, security measures and closures, plus links to other major sites – including inauguration guides from the DC city government and the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority. And the Washington Post has a comprehensive planning guide online. Check the sites often as they’re frequently updated. The Basics Inauguration activities will be centered on or near the National Mall, the sprawling promenade running from the Capitol to the Lincoln Memorial, where public viewing areas will be set up so that visitors can watch the events on large screens. To accommodate the crowds, officials will open some parts of the Mall previously closed during inaugurations. Many of the numerous monuments and museums on or around the Mall will remain open on Inauguration Day, but they may have modified schedules, so check the websites listed above. Even if they are much more crowded than usual, they should provide a stirring backdrop. (Besides, never underestimate the benefit of indoor plumbing, though thousands of portable restrooms will be located throughout the area and near subway stations.) More than 700 street vendors will be selling food near the parade route, with more in outlying areas. For restaurant options, see the Dining section below. Getting There A relatively compact city, Washington sits on the winding Potomac River, bordered by Virginia across the water and Maryland to the north, east and southeast. It’s laid out in four quadrants (NW, NE, SW and SE), with numbered streets running north and south, and lettered streets running east to west. Diagonal avenues bear state names. Visitors arriving at Reagan National Airport, the most convenient portal to the city, can take a minutes-long Metro subway or taxi ride (from about $11) to Downtown. From Virginia’s Dulles International, the Washington Flyer shuttle (888-927-4359) goes to the West Falls Church Metro stop, or take Metrobus 5A to the Rosslyn or L’Enfant Plaza subway stops; cabs into town run about $47 to $55. If you fly into Baltimore-Washington International, Amtrak and MARC offer train service to DC’s Union Station (served by Metro subway and buses), or hop on Metrobus B30 to the Greenbelt subway station; taxis are about $55 to $70 to central DC. Many travel providers, including airlines, bus companies and Amtrak, are adding service to accommodate the crowds, or are mulling plans to do so. Groups planning to travel to the city by motor coach can obtain information about parking, restrictions and permit requirements here. Getting Around During the inauguration period, you should plan on walking and using public transportation to access the Downtown core. Many streets around the Capitol and the Mall will be closed to vehicular traffic and parking, and security overall will be extremely tight. The Metro subway system will open early on Inauguration Day and close late, but it is best to carpool and get to Metro stations early since station parking (free for the day) will fill fast. To avoid delays, you can pre-purchase all-day Metro passes (see the WMATA website above). Allow plenty of time to get to the ceremony and parade route on Inauguration Day, and note that some stations and/or entrances will be closed due to security measures. Some items that would make a long walk in the rain (or snow, or sleet ...) a little easier – including strollers, backpacks and umbrellas – are prohibited from the security area nearest the Capitol where 240,000 spectators with tickets will either sit or stand. See www.washington.org for a complete list of banned objects. Dining While some restaurants near the Capitol and the inaugural parade route are booked for parties on Inauguration Day, others are still accepting reservations (but book soon). Or plan on eating Uptown: the Logan Circle, Adams-Morgan, U Street, Dupont Circle and Petworth neighborhoods offer a myriad of choices. You can also take the Metro to any number of communities in the surrounding states, including Virginia’s Clarendon, Arlington and Old Town Alexandria, as well Bethesda and Rockville, MD. Many eateries are offering special deals or have extended hours to mark the inauguration. For instance, Johnny’s Half Shell, across the street from the Capitol, will be selling “Oath of Office Recovery Kits” (soup and a roll, water and a hot drink) from its courtyard takeaway, Taqueria Nationale. It will also extend its usual hours, opening for lunch and dinner on Saturday, Sunday and Monday (January 17–19) and for dinner on inauguration night (it’s closed during the day since all of the nation’s governors will be breakfasting there). Celebrations at Proof, the Penn Quarter New American, kick off January 19th with a dinner show featuring Verve recording artist Melody Gardot and her band; they’ll entertain during a four-course dinner ($120, with seating at 9:30 PM; show only in the bar/lounge is $40). On Inauguration Day from 10 AM to 2:30 PM, visitors can stay warm while grazing a buffet brunch and enjoy unlimited champagne while watching the action on four TVs ($75). An after-the-ball party runs 11:30 PM to 3 AM; Gardot performs while guests munch on fois gras and other passed hors d’oeuvres and toast the president with Dom Perignon, Krug and Louis Roederer Cristal champagne ($250). And Ceiba – a Downtown Nuevo Latino just off the parade route at 701 14th Street – will offer hot chocolate and warm churros (Spanish doughnuts) for $9 on Inauguration Day. Finally, if you’re new to the city, be sure to try a half-smoke, a spicy sausage that’s the capital’s signature fare (it’s a popular item on sidewalk carts). But other cuisines abound, from chic bistros and clubby power eateries (where the nation’s business is discussed over prime steaks) to cutting-edge bec fin destinations (some driven by star chefs) and homey joints serving burgers. Check here for some of the city’s dining highlights, or take a look at some more inauguration-themed specials. Accommodations Many lodging options are requiring a three-to-five-night minimum stay and prepayment. Still, many Downtown and suburban hotels have long been sold out. Call Destination DC’s toll-free number (800-422-8644) to see what’s available. Local residents are also offering accommodations in their homes, though you’ll be paying a premium ($400 a night is not uncommon); check DC’s craigslist site for listings. Special Events Keeping busy for several days won’t be a problem for the inauguration-bound. The Smithsonian Institution and its cadre of world-class museums take days to explore, and you can’t beat the price (free) or the locale (for the most part, its components are on or near the Mall). But the been-there-done-that crowd should know that many are hosting inauguration-oriented exhibits; for instance, on January 20th, the National Portrait Gallery unveils \"Presidents in Waiting,\" a spotlight on vice presidents who eventually became chief executive. Then there are the many other museums and monuments citywide, plus a full spectrum of performances and parties. Among the festivities: Aretha Franklin is giving a free concert in honor of Martin Luther King Jr. Day at 6 PM January 19th at the Kennedy Center; go to www.kennedy-center.org for information. And while the Newseum (among the city’s newest museums) and many other ticket-required venues near the Mall are sold out for the days immediately preceding and following the inauguration, there are many fascinating places to explore outside the Downtown core. Check our guide to some of the top attractions, and go to www.washington.org for other ideas. Nightlife For the inauguration, restaurants and clubs will be open long hours – some virtually night and day – during the festivities. Inaugural balls and parties, whose guest lists include everyone from celebrities and politicos to campaign worker bees and Obama supporters, will fill hotels and ballrooms. Go to www.washington.org for a list of events, including the DC Blues Society’s Obamarama Pre-Inaugural Party at the Surf Club Live in Hyattsville, MD (it’s reachable by Metro); tickets for the January 16th fete are $12. Even if you won’t be attending an inauguration event, there’s no shortage of nightlife to keep you entertained. Straight-ahead jazz, R&B, punk and go-go enliven the music scene in the city’s clubs, swank lounges, WiFi’d work/play spaces and Belgian beer houses. And while Adams-Morgan, Dupont Circle and Georgetown have their charms (and legions of fans), the after-hours scene has expanded in U Street NW and H Street NE (Atlas District) as well as the Metro-accessible suburbs. Here’s a guide to some of the top spots. – Olga Boikess

Da Andrea photo: Courtesy of Da Andrea In our review of 10-year-old West Villager Da Andrea, surveyors point out that the restaurant is “narrow on space but broad in appeal.” Well, not for long. The casual Italian is serving its last meal in its current Hudson Street digs Saturday, December 20th, before packing up shop and moving to a roomier (75 seat) location at 35 W. 13th St. (between Fifth and Sixth Avenues), planned to open during the first week of February.

Famed chophouse Morton's The Steakhouse has been serving up steaks for 30 years now. To celebrate all that meat, the restaurant chain – which just opened its 80th restaurant in a massive, two-story space in Downtown Brooklyn – is offering a four-course surf 'n' turf dinner special. From now until the end of the year, diners at any Morton's can indulge in a salad, filet mignon with a potato or veggie, choice of scallops, shrimp or crab cake and either a hot chocolate cake or a key lime pie for dessert – all for $49.50 a person. So if you've been looking to check out the new Brooklyn digs (and maybe its new Bar 12•21), make sure you come hungry (available until December 31; 718-596-2700).

While restaurant closings have been all too frequent these days, the news that Chinatown's seminal dim sum house HSF has closed brought a particular pang to our hearts – the 36-year-old restaurant was part of the very first Zagat Survey (we wrote: \"Best Dim Sum in town; fun if you fill up a table – great buy\"). The restaurant is now operating under new management and a new name, Sun Shine 27.

Toloache photo: Ryan Charles Sure, Christmas is coming, but you know what else is coming? Hanukkah. And this year the annual Jewish Festival of Light is right in the middle of that other winter holiday, starting at sundown on December 21st and going to sundown on the 29th. Maybe this time around, instead of spending hours grating potatoes at home, why not let somebody else make the latkes? To that end, Hell's Kitchen Mexican Toloache would love to help. From December 22nd–29th, the restaurant – one of the top-rated Mexicans in our survey – is serving up its take on some of the holiday's classic dishes including a trio of latkes (potato jalapeño latkes with horseradish cream, zucchini latkes with tomatillo apple salsa and Mexican ricotta latkes with chipotle and agave nectar) for $13, a brisket taco ($13) and a $9 take on the dessert soofganiot (doughnuts) stuffed with dulce de leche (212-581-1818; reserve online).

With holiday parties being canceled left and right, lots of restaurants are trying to figure out ways to make up for lost revenue. And one way they're doing it is with New Year's Eve dinners, where attendees can say a grand goodbye to 2008 and a hearty hello to 2009. To help you figure out where to sing \"Auld Lang Syne,\" we've put together a list of special New Year's events. Reserve quickly, however, as some may sell out. Angelo & Maxie's: At this Flatiron chop shop the new year will be rung in with a family-style feast for the whole table, including three appetizers, an entree and two sides, plus a family-style dessert menu ($95 per person, seatings at 5, 7 and 10 PM). Starting at 10 PM there will also be a live DJ and an open bar for an additional $40 per person (212-220-9200). Atlantic Grill: The Upper East Side seafooder is offering a three-course prix fixe at two seatings from 6:30–7:30 PM and 9:30–10:30 PM (the second goes to midnight and includes a glass of champagne). Planned choices from the menu include a Kobe beef maki roll, mustard-crusted rack of lamb, roasted Maine lobster and chocolate raspberry tart ($75 for the first seating, $89 for the second seating; 212-988-9200). Bar Boulud: Daniel Boulud's casual Lincoln Center bistro is offering a three-course prix fixe as well as its à la carte menu at seatings from 5–6 PM ($65 per person).

12 Must-See Manhattan Murals
***AUTHOR
BuzzEditor
***DATE
2009-12-10 00:00:00
***CONTENT
By Curt Gathje, ZAGAT.com staff editor These murals are not to be missed. Atmosphere is key to dining and drinking in NY, and the reopening of the Plaza Hotel’s Oak Bar – with its famed Everett Shinn murals – reawakened our interest in one particular kind of atmosphere, the wall mural. Manhattan is home to a variety of murals, ranging from the satiric to the pastoral to the racy. Here are 12 must-sees: King Cole Bar 2 E. 55th St., 212-339-6721 photo: courtesy of King Cole Bar Probably the city’s most famous mural, this merry rendition of nursery-rhyme perennial Old King Cole hangs in the eponymous St. Regis barroom. Painted by illustrator Maxfield Parrish, the mural was originally made for Midtown’s Knickerbocker Hotel and then displayed in several other locations before landing in the St. Regis in the 1930s. It’s said that John Jacob Astor (who owned the Knickerbocker and commissioned the work) requested that his face be used as the model for the king’s, and there is some resemblance; it’s also said that the king is pictured while breaking wind, a not-so-far-fetched idea given his posture and his jesters’ expressions. Oak Bar 10 Central Park S.; 212-758-7777 photo: Evan W. Miller The Oak Bar was the brainchild of hotel magnate Conrad Hilton, who opened this very lucrative barroom (replacing a very unlucrative brokerage office) in 1945. To capitalize on the Plaza’s old-world air, Hilton commissioned artist Everett Shinn, a charter member of the Ashcan School, to execute three moody murals depicting turn-of-the-century nighttime scenes around the hotel. The murals make a memorable appearance in the Hitchcock thriller North by Northwest, wherein Cary Grant is kidnapped from a front booth in the bar. Café des Artistes 1 W. 67th St.; 212-877-3500 photo: Lauren Dru Set in the circa-1917 Hotel des Artistes apartment house, this cafe is home to a multipanel mural featuring nude maidens cavorting in idyllic woodland settings. The artist, illustrator Howard Chandler Christy, lived in the building and painted the murals over a three-year period beginning in 1934. Though the subjects are usually described as ‘wood nymphs,’ they seem to owe more to 1930s pinup girls than to A Midsummer Night’s Dream sprites. The Palm 837 Second Ave.; 212-687-2953 photo: Lauren Dru Walls festooned with cartoon characters and celeb caricatures are the signature of this steakhouse chain, which began rather humbly on Second Avenue in 1926: the owners had no money for decor, so they bartered food and drink in return for spur-of-the-moment drawings. (Conveniently located near the headquarters of King Features Syndicate, the Palm had quickly become a haunt for newspaper cartoonists.) Caricatures of celeb regulars were later added to the mix, and in the 1970s, the restaurant began to spin off satellites worldwide, each with its own fresh set of murals. Still, aficionados claim it’s hard to top the original branch at 837 Second Avenue for authenticity. Murals on 54 63 W. 54th St.; 212-314-7700 photo: Courtesy of Murals on 54 Midtown’s Warwick Hotel was bankrolled by newspaper tycoon William Randolph Hearst, and in 1937 he commissioned illustrator Dean Cornwell to make four murals for its restaurant, then known as the Raleigh Room. Depicting historic moments in the life of Sir Walter Raleigh, the project was nearly completed when a dispute over compensation arose. In retaliation, Cornwell painted in some rough stuff (most famously, figures relieving themselves on Sir Walter and Queen Elizabeth I), but after a settlement was reached, most of the offending material was painted out. Still, some naughty bits remain – ask the maitre d’ to point them out. Bemelmans Bar 35 E. 76th St.; 212-744-1600 photo: Lauren Dru The only NYC barroom named after its muralist, this Carlyle Hotel watering hole features art by Ludwig Bemelmans, a writer/illustrator best known for his series of children’s books about Madeline, a plucky French schoolgirl. The circa-1947 murals depict whimsical scenes of Central Park (including a cameo appearance by Madeline herself), and are Bemelmans’ only artwork on public display. In lieu of payment, the artist bartered the murals for a gratis year-and-a-half stay at the hotel. A.J. Maxwell’s 57 W. 48th St.; 212-262-6200 photo: Lauren Dru All that remains of the long-ago restaurant the Forum of the Twelve Caesars is this mosaic mural of ancient Roman life hanging in the bar of steakhouse A.J. Maxwell’s. The Forum of the Twelve Caesars (1957–1975) was one of the most expensive and over-the-top theme restaurants of its day, with oversize menus, waiters clad in Roman tunics and centurion helmets doubling as ice buckets. When the murals were uncovered beneath drywall during A.J. Maxwell’s renovations, reporters had some fun with the discovery. Sample headlines: “Roman Mosaic Found In Midtown Manhattan,” “A Glimpse Into The Lost Civilization of A.D. 1957.” O’Neals’ 49 W. 64th St.; 212-787-4663 photo: Lauren Dru The appropriately named “Dancers at the Bar” hanging in O’Neals’ barroom was originally commissioned for O’Neals’ Baloon, a long-gone saloon opposite Lincoln Center (today a P.J. Clarke’s spin-off). Painted by Robert Crowl in the early 1970s, it depicts noted ballet dancers from that era (Peter Martins, Edward Villella, Patricia McBride) as well as regulars of the establishment. It was very much a work in progress – the subjects were obliged to pose in the morning, before the bar opened – and completed over several months’ time. In 1991, O’Neals’ Baloon shuttered and the mural lay in storage until it was moved to its current location in 2003. Overlook 225 E. 44th St.; 212-682-7266 photo: Lauren Dru There’s quite a backstory to the Overlook’s murals. Here goes: around the corner in the 1930s was a dive bar called Costello’s that boasted a literati following (Ernest Hemingway, John O’Hara) and murals painted by James Thurber. Costello’s was demolished for an office tower and moved around the corner in 1973 to the present Overlook site; the Thurber murals somehow went missing during the move. To replace them, members of the National Cartoonists Society were invited in 1976 to decorate the walls. In 2005, the Overlook owners invited the cartoonists back to do another wall. Above, a detail from the 1976 murals. Palio Bar 151 W. 51st St.; 212-399-9400 photo: Lauren Dru Hidden in the Palio Bar in the AXA Equitable Center, this four-panel, wraparound mural depicts the Palio horse race, an annual tradition in the Tuscan city of Siena that dates back to medieval times. This lively, neo-expressionist work – painted by Italian artist Sandro Chia in 1985 for a reputed $500,000 – is said to be a metaphor for living life to the fullest. Le Cirque 151 E. 58th St.; 212-644-0202 photo: courtesy of Robert Cenedella Titled “Le Cirque, The First Generation,” this 1998 mural by artist Robert Cenedella was commissioned in honor of the restaurant’s move to the Palace Hotel, and captures for posterity 157 guests at its original Mayfair Hotel setting. (It hangs today in Le Cirque’s 3.0 incarnation in the Bloomberg Tower.) Movers and shakers depicted include Richard Nixon, Jacqueline Onassis, Bill Cosby, Sophia Loren, Nancy Reagan and Barbara Walters; characteristically, Le Cirque owner Sirio Maccioni is said to have orchestrated the seating plan for the work. At present, Cenedella is working on a similar mural of the denizens of a more downscale venue, TriBeCa’s Nancy Whiskey Pub. Waverly Inn 16 Bank St.; 212-243-7900 photo: courtesy of the Waverly Inn Although in a public place – a Village restaurant – this mural goes virtually unseen by most of the public since that restaurant is the Waverly Inn, one of the toughest reservations in town. (Wannasees, however, can refer to Pantheon’s newly published book, The Mural at the Waverly Inn). Although the joint has been around under various guises since 1920, the mural was commissioned by its latest owner, Graydon Carter, and painted by caricaturist Edward Sorel in 2006. Depicting famous personages with ties to the Village, it feels like it’s been there forever and seems destined to be just as renowned as Old King Cole in the annals of NY muraldom. Above, one segment of the vast mural, picturing Edgar Allan Poe, Dashiell Hammett, Thelonious Monk, Norman Mailer, Eleanor Roosevelt, Emma Goldman, Bob Dylan and Jack Kerouac.

Tea & Sympathy Photo: Noah Kalina If vacationing in another country seems like an impossibility given these tough economic times, why not try a foodie staycation instead? Forget the luggage and passport – there are plenty of restaurants with food and atmosphere that will make you feel like you’re thousands of miles from home. Following are some options. FireBird 365 W. 46th St.; 212-586-0244 Visit St. Petersburg on Restaurant Row at this dazzling, opulent Russian replete with antique furnishings, costumed waiters, caviar blini and (of course) over 160 vodkas. Las Ramblas 170 W. Fourth St.; 646-415-7924 This atmospheric Spaniard makes it easy to imagine you’re on the namesake Barcelona street rather than waiting for a seat in the tiny, brick-walled Village digs; better yet, the tapas won’t tap out your budget. Le Colonial 149 E. 57th St.; 212-752-0808 You’re transported back to 1920s Saigon at this East Side French-Vietnamese that sets the stage with ceiling fans, flora and a sultry upstairs bar. Milos, Estiatorio 125 W. 55th St.; 212-245-7400 Ok, it can be pricey, but this big, airy Greek seafooder in the West 50s is a whole lot cheaper than a trip to Athens. Tea & Sympathy 108 Greenwich Ave.; 212-807-8329 Afternoon tea, bangers ’n’ mash, Welsh rarebit, a room filled with expats – you can’t get much closer to England in New York than at this West Village British oasis. – Jeff Freier

The CB3 Chronicles: Veselka Approved, Le Souk Left Hanging
***AUTHOR
BuzzEditor
***DATE
2009-12-09 00:00:00
***CONTENT
VeselkaWhile signing out of the East Village senior residence that houses the monthly Community Board 3 State Liquor Authority committee meetings last night, a gentleman turned to us and commented that \"these are the toughest meetings in town.\" He wasn't wrong. With only fifteen items on the agenda, the evening's proceedings still managed to take five hours before all was said and done. But when the dust settled, at least a few big developments had occurred: neighborhood standard Veselka's new outpost was approved, the nightclub Le Souk was hotly debated, a new mezcal-themed cultural center was approved, a slick wine bar was rejected, and that's just to start. For more on the best free entertainment in the East Village, read past the jump.• The biggest event of the evening was easily the approval of Veselka at 9 E. First St. An earlier attempt at obtaining a license had been stymied by the landlord, Avalon Bay, which had refused to work in a friendly manner with the board while planning out the restaurant and nightlife features in its enormous complex of buildings straddling Houston Street. After the board approved a license for Daniel Boulud's burger joint in the complex, it turned down Veselka and a restaurant called Las Ventanas, and asked Avalon to explain its plans before sending any more business before them. And they never did. Despite this, out of a deep affection for the pierogi palace, the committee gave the restaurant approval to run an all-night outpost with a full liquor license. There was one abstention, however, from a committee member who thought that the owners of Veselka \"should have known better than to get in with [Avalon Bay].\"• The other restaurant up for a license in the Avalon complex, Las Ventanas, was not so lucky. A three-story Mexican bar/restaurant with a 225-person capacity and a 40-food bar from the owners of Son Cubano and Flor de Sol, the restaurant was a tough sell from the get-go. Not helping matters was the lawyer for the proposed restaurant, who came out red-faced and itching for a fight with members of the committee. The restaurant's case was further hurt by a combative owner who quickly insulted the honesty of a board member, the block he wanted to open his restaurant on and the neighborhood dive, Mars Bar, across the street. In the end, the restaurant's excessive hours for a dining establishment (they wanted to stay open until 4 AM), its proximity to similar long-standing establishments and the number of other liquor licenses nearby meant that the license was denied by the committee. But that doesn't mean the fight is over. The restaurant's lawyer rushed out of the meeting looking ready to fight the decision when it moves its way up to the actual SLA.• The other big rejection of the night came for an Austrian wine bar on Ninth Street from the owner of Bar Veloce. The bar had previously appeared before the SLA committee in September but withdrawn its application when it became clear that the owner had not done enough community outreach with his new neighbors and block association. Apparently he didn't learn his lesson, having in the interim sent a single e-mail through his lawyer to the block association. On the other hand, a cadre of Ninth Street residents showed up to the meeting and expressed their disdain for the idea of a midblock wine bar anywhere near Coyote Ugly and Cheap Shots. • Veselka wasn't the only neighborhood standard up on the block. The bar half of Avenue A's classic Odessa was up for a renewal with a complaint history involving security on the weekends. But all appeared to have been cleaned up and the license was renewed.• Much of the first hour of the evening was spent on a lively, if typically East Village crazy, neighborhood debate of the merits of much-maligned Le Souk. Everyone spoke, from the kid who had been in the neighborhood for three years (\"I came here because all of my friends hang out at Le Souk ... I'm really impressed with the quality of life and I really like the neighborhood for what it is.\") to the angry long-time neighbor (\"[Le Souk] has no respect for the law, no respect for the SLA and no respect for the Community Board, and it is time we did something about it.\") to the happy long-time neighbor (\"I would rather have throw-up on my door than someone breaking into my door.\"), but in the end it was all for naught. Because the license at Le Souk is currently in dispute, the committee didn't feel comfortable making a decision until all had been resolved.• Less contentious but no less amusing was the discussion of renewal for the lounge 40c at 40 Avenue C. The space's troubles, according to its slightly frazzled owner, are two-fold: first, they ran the \"Trash\" party from the old Rififi a few times after it closed and attracted a bit too much attention from revelers and the police, and, second, some party-loving NYU students live upstairs. Unfortunately, since the bar uses its address as its name, this leads to no end of confusion when the tenants choose to throw parties that are advertised on Facebook, leading to underage students drinking at the bar. But 40c has been working with the students to solve the confusion and its license was, in the end, renewed. • Despite an awful attempt at renewing his license two months ago, the owner of Klimat on Seventh Street managed to obtain a renewal under the condition that his windows and doors be closed tightly from 10 PM on, among many other stipulations.• After being told to come back a bit more prepared after a previous attempt before the committee, the owners of Elizabeth Street's Café el Portal and Xicala were recommended for a license for their expansive Mexican cultural-learning center and mezcal-showcase at 86 Orchard St., Casa Mezcal. One of the highlights of the evening was the committee debating the merits of naming a cultural center after an alcoholic beverage. • Not everything was as exciting, though. As far as the no-drama items on the agenda go, here's a quick roundup: The new Korean street-food spot Seoul Station at 81 St. Marks was approved for a beer license; Happy Garden Palace at 54 East Broadway was approved for an eating place beer license; the two-year-old Thai restaurant Sticky Rice on 85 Orchard got itself a full liquor license; a Southern-French-Med eatery at 112 Suffolk St. got a restaurant wine license; Galaxy 45 at 45 Mott St. had its license upgraded despite some genuine confusion on the part of the owner as to why he hadn't been before the committee before; Fat Hippo, a year-delayed restaurant at 71 Clinton St., came back before the committee and was again approved for a full license; and, finally, the Moonstruck diner at 88 Second Ave. had its license renewed.– Garth Johnston

Even in tighter economic times, Brooklyn is still booming. In the past year, the borough has seen a steady stream of new spots to eat, drink, stay and play, the most noteworthy of which can be perused in the just-released Best of Brooklyn 2009 Zagat Survey. This year, Prospect Heights’ Garden Café was ranked No. 1 for Food and Service while River Café finished No. 1 for Decor. The runner-up in the Food category was Peter Luger, which has been New York's No. 1 steakhouse for 25 years in a row. And the guide doesn't just cover dining: in the borough's increasingly swanky local nightlife scene, Stonehome Wine Bar claimed the top Appeal spot. With additional must-have information about shopping and attractions, the guide makes a great stocking stuffer for the Brooklynite (or wannabe Brooklynite) in your life.

As it becomes clearer that this recession isn't going anywhere soon, more and more restaurants are pitching in with deals to keep diners enticed, and Greenwich Village spot North Square is no exception. Starting this month the New American is offering half-off wine on six selections from its list – chosen by themes like region and varietals. It's also introducing a monthly drink-and-app combo special for $15. This month the wine deal focuses on wines from the Piedmont region while the $15 combo features vegetable empanaditas and a Catro cocktail (rum, Calvados and fresh orange juice) that normally would set you back $22 (212-254-1200; reserve online).

photo: Mike Ritter Seventy-five years ago, on December 5th, 1933, the state of Utah ratified the 21st Amendment and effectively ended the 13-year dry spell in American history known as Prohibition. In the past, that event has mostly interested historians, but in recent years restaurateurs and bar owners have begun honoring the date with an informal \"Repeal Day.\" So how to celebrate Repeal Day? You don't need to buy a costume or give a gift – all you need to do is kick back and enjoy your constitutional right to imbibe. And what better place to get into the spirit (or spirits, as the case may be) than these five establishments that were once actual speakeasies: Bill’s Gay Nineties Commerce Flute Midtown Onieal’s Grand Street 21 Club

***CONTENT
Looking for gift ideas for the gourmand readers in your life (other than, naturally, all the latest Zagat guides)? Fret not, here are some recent books about cooking, dining and food that will fill the bill. For the Foodie on the Cutting Edge A Day at el Bulli, Ferran Adrià (Phaidon Press, $49.95): In hundreds of pages and photos, a day in the life of one of the most influential restaurants in the world is vividly captured. Though recipes are few and far between, the sheer scope of the book reflects el Bulli's reputation as a mecca for culinary innovation, and helps explain why it's virtually impossible to get a reservation there. Alinea, Grant Achatz (Ten Speed Press, $50): Re-create otherworldly dishes from Achatz's Chicago hot spot with this gorgeously photographed cookbook that offers recipes that come directly from the restaurant's kitchen. It's the ideal gift for the aspiring molecular gastronomist in your life. Under Pressure: Cooking Sous Vide, Thomas Keller (Artisan, $75): The art of sous vide – cooking food in airtight bags – is explained to the home cook with beautiful photographs and careful instructions from the chef behind The French Laundry. For the Foodie in Search of Something Different Eat Me: The Food and Philosophy of Kenny Shopsin, Kenny Shopsin and Carolynn Carreno (Knopf, $24.95): Kenny Shopsin runs one of NYC's most unique restaurants, and his famous 900-item menu is reproduced here in a 12-page spread. In this surprisingly touching book, the chef dishes not only on his business and world philosophy but also reveals recipes for some of his most famous dishes, including Blisters on My Sisters, his take on huevos rancheros. The Hungry Scientist Handbook: Electric Birthday Cakes, Edible Origami, and Other DIY Projects for Techies, Tinkerers, and Foodies, Patrick Buckley and Laura Bins (Collins, $16.99): For creative chefs who are bored with the same old dishes, this romp of a cookbook should spark inspiration with recipes for dishes like edible origami, glowing lollipops, cryogenic martinis and more. For the Know-It-All Foodie Bacardi and the Long Fight for Cuba: The Biography of a Cause, Tom Gjelten (Viking Adult, $27.95): In this intriguing new tome, NPR correspondent Gjelten explores the rich history of Cuba through the lens of the politically active rum maker. The Bagel: A Cultural History, Maria Balinska (Yale, $25): The journey of the bagel from Jewish bakeries in Poland to the American breakfast table is one full of surprising anecdotes, not to mention cameos from the likes of Shirley Temple and 17th-century king of Poland Jan Sobieski. The Fortune Cookie Chronicles: Adventures in the World of Chinese Food, Jennifer 8. Lee (Twelve, $24.99): The New York Times' Lee takes a journey through the cultural and culinary history of one of the most enduring cuisines in America with side ruminations on topics like the enduring relationship between Jews and Chinese food. A Geography of Oysters: The Connoisseur's Guide to Oyster Eating in North America, Rowan Jacobsen (Bloomsbury, $16): This exhaustive history of the mollusk covers everything from cultivating pearls to the art of shucking with plenty of historical detours. For the Francophile Foodie The Complete Robuchon, Joël Robuchon (Knopf, $35): The world-famous chef brings his entire philosophy to the table in this dense but not daunting guide to cooking French food well. French Milk, Lucy Knisley (Touchstone, $15): To celebrate her and her mother's birthdays, the author traveled to Paris for a month to eat and explore. The resulting graphic novel brings to life the joys of a Parisian adventure – and the sweetness of the eponymous drink. For the Bad-Tipper Foodie Service Included: Four-Star Secrets of an Eavesdropping Waiter, Phoebe Damrosch (Harper, $13.95): From learning how to politely interrupt diners at Per Se to dealing with \"anonymous\" restaurant critics, this book casually invites you into the intimidating world of four-star service. Waiter Rant: Thanks for the Tip–Confessions of a Cynical Waiter, Steve Dublanica (Ecc, $24.95): After three years of blogging anonymously, Dublanica has come out into the open to tell diners what your servers really think of you. For the Media-Junkie Foodie Julie & Julia: My Year of Cooking Dangerously, Julie Powell (Back Bay Books, $13.99): In one year Powell cooked every one of the 524 recipes in Julia Child's Mastering the Art of French Cooking, and the resulting blog and book have proved so charming and popular that a movie with Meryl Streep as Julia and Amy Adams as Julie is coming to theaters next year. Top Chef: The Cookbook, The Creators of Top Chef (Chronicle, $29.95): For the loved one who just can't get enough of Tom, Padma and the gang comes a cookbook with 100 recipes from the first three seasons of the popular cooking competition. For the Nostalgic Foodie Amarcord: Marcella Remembers, Marcella Hazan (Gotham, $27.50): Known as the \"Italian Julia Child\" thanks to her wildly influential cookbooks, Hazan has written a memoir that reflects upon her childhood in Cesenatico, her marriage and, of course, her rise in the gastronomic world. Dining at Delmonico's: The Story of America's Oldest Restaurant, Judith Choate (Stewart, Tabori & Chang, $45): Choate provides the history of NYC's 1837 landmark restaurant, from major culinary innovations like eggs Benedict to its revolutionary dining practices like using tablecloths. Eat, Memory: Great Writers at the Table: A Collection of Essays from the New York Times: Edited by Amanda Hesser (W. W. Norton, $24.95): Conventional but well-written descriptions of meals mix with idiosyncratic tales in this collection of 26 stories that will both entertain and enlighten.

Talking Turkey
***AUTHOR
BuzzEditor

***CONTENT
Let us consider the turkey, that curiously hyperbolic fowl that an uncommonly large number of us will be forced to consume tomorrow. Turkey is a creature that one either loves, or doesn't love, with only a very few left sitting on the proverbial fence. One of the greatest fan of the turkey was gastronome and chef Jean-Anthelme Brillat-Savarin, who wrote in his landmark volume The Physiology of Taste that: \"When the vine-grower or ploughman wants a treat on some long winter evening, what do we see roasting over a bright fire in the kitchen where the table is laid? A turkey. When the hard-working artisan invites a few friends to enjoy a holiday which is all the more precious for being rare, what is sure to be the principal dish of the feast? A turkey, stuffed with sausages or Lyons chestnuts. And in the high places of gastronomy, at those select gatherings where politics are forced to give way to dissertations on taste, what do the guests hope for and long for as the second course? A truffled turkey!\" Brillat-Savarin obviously liked his turkey. On the other hand, William Connor, who wrote under the named \"Cassandra\" in the London Daily Mirror back in the '50s, was not much of a fan of the bird at all. He wrote: \"The turkey has practically no taste except a dry fibrous flavour reminiscent of warmed-up plaster of Paris and horsehair. The texture is like wet sawdust and the whole vast feathered swindle has the piquancy of a boiled mattress.\" Myself, I agree more with the Brit than the Frenchman. More often than not, it is a dry thing, eaten with untoward haste so that we might return as quickly as possible to watching the 27 millionth rerun of Miracle on 34th Street. The whole Thanksgiving meal is a true oddity, for it is not so much savored as it is inhaled – 12 hours of cooking devoured in 12 minutes at the table. Years ago, I suggested to some friends that our Thanksgiving feast be eaten in courses, rather than in one trip to the trough. They regarded me with the sort of shock that might have been appropriate had I suggested we do our dining in pink tutus. Still, there's no denying the undeniable historical solidity of the turkey. Despite New Yorker scribe Calvin Trillin's argument that we should be eating spaghetti carbonara to honor Thanksgiving, rather than this large, unwieldy, notably dumb bird, turkey seems to be with us to stay. And, turkey is about as native as anything we eat. The bird was first introduced to the Old World by any number of Spanish conquistadors – either Miguel de Passamonte, Francisco de Cordoba, or Hernando Cortes, all of whom sent turkeys back to Spain from Mexico – where it was known as the \"Rooster of the Jesuits.\" The Aztecs who raised the bird called it a \"peru,\" which is odd, for turkeys are not found in Peru. But then, they're not found in India either, which didn't keep the French from calling them the \"Bird of India\" – d'Inde, which metamorphosed into the word \"dinde,\" French for \"turkey.\" Both the Germans and Dutch also thought that turkeys came from India, calling them Calecutische Hahn and Kalkoen respectively. It was the English, fuzzy as ever concerning geography, who named the bird the \"turkey,\" in much the same spirit that they turned Jerez into \"sherry.\" If old Ben Franklin had had his way, the turkey would be the national bird today, instead of the eagle, and probably rightly so. Though of course, there's a good chance then that someone would try to instigate a constitutional amendment making it a federal crime to eat a turkey. And don't forget to eat yours with fenberry sauce and misickquatash – far more colorful names than the latterday monikers of cranberry sauce and succotash. – Merrill Shindler

Behind the Scenes of Top Chef
***AUTHOR
BuzzEditor
***DATE
2009-11-25 00:00:00
***CONTENT
By Jacqueline Wasilczyk, ZAGAT.com Staff Editor After five seasons of being involved with Top Chef, Lee Anne Wong shares some behind-the-scenes scoop. Lee Anne Wong Top Chef whips up drama on TV screens every Wednesday night, but there's plenty of action that happens off-camera too, something that the show’s current culinary supervisor, season one contestant Lee Anne Wong, knows all about. She spoke to us recently to shed light on former scandals, the appeal of the series and what it takes to survive life after the competition. Zagat Buzz: With the show in its fifth season, how do you keep it fresh? Is it true that you try never to repeat a challenge? Lee Anne Wong: In many ways, new contestants keep it fresh. We could put them through all of the same challenges we’ve put other seasons through and you’d get totally different results. We are always striving to think outside of the box while still paying homage to the simple beauty of food, [but] we’ve [also] managed to create some challenges that have become favorites season after season, like our relay race and restaurant wars. ZB: What’s the most common behind-the-scenes difficulty in setting up and executing a challenge? And how do you decide on the task? LAW: Most challenges are only mapped out a few days ahead of time, and you’d be amazed at how much last-minute swapping and decision-making is involved. Sometimes it has to do with the sponsor, or whether or not a certain guest judge is available; other times it’s as simple as getting a location secured. Usually the challenge team looks to me for guidelines on which ingredients should be made available, equipment restrictions, time limits and budgets. I also provide a realistic point of view of the contestants’ limitations, like if it’s possible to cook [a dish] in minutes or the time I filleted a fish blindfolded. It’s a big ballet really, and amazing to see how much stuff it takes us to get everything ready [only to] tear it all down and leave virtually no footprint in a matter of hours. ZB: How much input do the show’s sponsors have on challenges? LAW: The money to make television doesn’t grow on trees. I think that’s about all I’m allowed to say. ZB: Scallops have been quite popular the past few seasons and have sparked a bit of scandal (à la Spike Mendelsohn’s decision to use Rick Tramonto's frozen ones). Do you expect them to continue to be a hot item (we did notice one pop up in the premiere), or have you tried to push the cheftestants toward other ingredients? LAW: Hehehe. There was one Quickfire this season where we had staged them in the fridge in the Top Chef Kitchen. Angie (my right-hand woman on my culinary team) and I caught each other’s eye, and I just walked over to the fridge and took out both the bay scallops and diver scallops, tucked them under my arm and walked off the set. There were plenty of other seafood and meat choices in the fridge still. Lunch was delicious that day. And that Tramonto thing was all my fault, for the record. ZB: Do you feel that by this season, the judges expect more from the contestants? How has the addition of Toby Young on the panel changed the judging dynamic? LAW: Absolutely, the judges have already seen a wealth of talent in the four seasons past so these contestants have big shoes to fill. Toby Young has added a very new, very tongue-in-cheek element to the judges’ table. I would watch judges’ table and some of the things he would say would make you spit your soda out your nose. I know that Tom, while he didn’t always agree with Toby’s POV, certainly welcomed his presence and enjoyed his commentary, as we all did. ZB: How has placing the show in New York changed the competition? LAW: Location, location, location. It’s quite simply the food capital of the world. It sets the tone, the level of excitement and the intensity. Plus, the judges this season are some of the best chefs in the country. ZB: You’ve managed to spin your Top Chef success into an established media-chef career. Any advice for current contestants who would like to do the same? LAW: I always tell the smart ones to remember that the cameras are always rolling. Top Chef is a stepping-stone and an opportunity to find out the blood and guts of yourself as a cook, and also who you are as a person. The ones who listen to what the judges have to say and move forward usually have a better chance of keeping in the public’s good favor. Every now and then you get a contestant who believes too much in their own hype, and then they self-implode. It’s up to you to figure out who I’m talking about. So in other words, keep working. There is life after Chef.

Pranna photo: Evan W. Miller The owners of Long Island’s Maine Maid Inn and Sitar make their NYC debut with Pranna, a larger-than-life Gramercy Pan-Asian in the sprawling former Scopa site; given its airy dining room, subterranean exposed-brick Wine Cellar, curtained-off Satay Lounge and two inviting bars, the sexy space is as multifaceted as the pricey menu, which dabbles in flavors from India, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam (79 Madison Ave.; 212-696-5700). East Midtown’s former Django space has been taken over by At Vermilion, a stylish Chicago import serving spicy (and pricey) Indo-Latin fusion cuisine; both levels – the ground-floor lounge and the vast upstairs dining room – sport a minimalist look with lots of white, metal and black-and-white photography (480 Lexington Ave.; 212-871-6600).

The results of our 2008 Airline Survey are in, and while there were a few positive developments, the industry as a whole is hardly flying high in the public’s eyes. First, the good news: average overall ratings – factoring in Comfort, Service and Food scores – rose slightly for premium and economy class performance in both the domestic and international ranks. Not surprisingly, premium class showed the most improvement. And a number of carriers – including Continental, JetBlue, Midwest and Virgin America domestically and Air New Zealand, Cathay Pacific, Emirates, Singapore and Virgin Atlantic internationally – turned in solid performances despite the tough conditions facing the industry. Still, in the domestic economy ranks, several airlines again scored better for their websites than for their in-air performance. And the 9,950 surveyors who participated continued to express a high degree of airborne discontent (read some of their comments here). Other survey highlights: – Among large domestic airlines, Continental was voted No. 1 in premium class while JetBlue took top honors for economy. Looking at just the U.S. “Big Six” – American, Continental, Delta, Northwest, United, US Airways (soon to be “Big Five” with the merger of Delta and Northwest) – Continental led in all categories, as it did in ’07. It was also deemed the best value among all airlines for international flights. – Among midsized domestics, Virgin America, the low-cost, high-style newcomer launched by Richard Branson in 2007, continued to impress, ranking No. 1 in premium and No. 2 – after winner Midwest – in economy. – Singapore Airlines keeps gaining altitude: it topped the international ranks in both premium and economy classes for the ninth Survey in a row. – Delay-weary fliers cited Southwest as having the best on-time performance among domestics. Southwest was also saluted for offering the best value domestically as well as the best website, frequent-flier program and luggage policy. – Top in-flight entertainment honors went to JetBlue domestically, Virgin Atlantic internationally. – When booking, 60% of surveyors use airline websites, while only 4% call the airline. Sites such as Expedia, Travelocity and the like are used by 18%, while 9% book through work and 8% use a travel agent. – 65% of surveyors use their frequent-flier miles for free flights; 25% use them for upgrades; and 10% don't use them. This year’s Survey included 17 domestic airlines and 68 airlines that fly internationally. Each surveyor took an average of 16.3 flights per year, for a total of 162,000 annual trips; 38% were for leisure, 62% for business.

Outtakes: 2008 Airline Survey Edition

***CONTENT
The 9,950 surveyors who participated in Zagat's 2008 Airline Survey had plenty of gripes about air travel. Below are some of our favorite comments. (To see the results of the survey, click here.) The Rhett Butler of airlines: they just don't give a damn. Used to be great, now just grating... A Greyhound bus with wings. You get what you pay for – in other words, you don't get it if you don't pay extra for it! Eggs in a carton have more room. The only thing older than the planes are the flight attendants. Next they'll charge for using the air vents, seat belts and bathroom. Did I get fatter or did their seats get smaller? Too bad passengers can't chip in for a flight attendant friendliness upgrade. Just another cattle car, but the cows usually get more respect. Please bring change for your potato chips. These are tough times and your ass pays the price. The woman behind the counter told me to blame the Bush Administration. Trying hard to encourage us to drive. Like spending four hours in third class on the Titanic. Gets you where you're going ... sometimes Bathrooms smell like the lion house at the zoo on a hot day. Domestic economy is a mobile prison only it lacks the food and the exercise yard. The boarding agents must have learned public relations from Genghis Khan. Flight attendants are creative in finding places to hide during the flight. Oh, for the good old days when we had food to complain about. Like the Flintstones, their planes are a page right out of history, and their service is bedrock. Would rather flap my arms than book this airline. They don't allow guns in the airport because passengers would shoot the desk clerks and be acquitted. A cross-country flight is as comfortable as a colonoscopy. Suffers from delusions of adequacy.

Tavern on the Green and Other Thanksgiving Take-out Options

Still figuring out what you're doing for Turkey Day next week? Don't want to cook but don't want to go out ro eat in a restaurant full of people you don't know? Enter the Thanksgiving take-out dinner. In order to milk as much out of the heavy-eating holiday as possible in a rough economy, restaurants are stepping up their take-out options. Even the city's highest-grossing restaurant, the Tavern on the Green, is getting in on the action. Along with its regular holiday seatings, the Tavern, a restaurant celebrated for its decor, is offering a take-out feast at a remarkably low price point. For a dinner that includes pumpkin-and-chestnut bisque, roast turkey with quince, cornbread-and-sausage stuffing, roast yams, mashed potatoes, green beans, roast shallots, gravy, cranberry relish and an apple-cranberry-walnut crisp, to-go diners need only pay $60 for four people, $110 for eight and $150 for 12 people. That's just $15–$12.50 per person – an amazing bargain compared to the $105–$135 you would be charged to eat a similar dinner at the restaurant (to order visit tavernonthegreen.com or call 212-873-3200 ext. 295). And Tavern isn't the only restaurant doing a take-out turkey dinner. Wildwood Barbecue in the Flatiron has lots of options to keep you and yours sated including a turkey on its own ($55 serves six–eight people), a turkey with a slew of standard fixings ($160 for six–eight people) and additional sides sold by the pound (call 212-533-2500 to place an order). And that's not all. As we mentioned previously, Hill Country is offering a whole pit-smoked turkey to go, Momofuku Ssäm Bar can provide you with an at-home bo ssäm bonanza and Supper has a hefty Thanksgiving dinner available to eat-in or to take out.

Talking With the Complete Joel Robuchon

***CONTENT
Joël Robuchon photo: Gerard Bedeau Learning to cook from Joël Robuchon, whose world-renowned restaurants stretch from New York to London to Tokyo and back again, might seem intimidating, to say the least. But the chef's latest cookbook, The Complete Robuchon, is anything but. Commencing with a simple introduction on the art of eating, it offers rudimentary explanations of cooking techniques – from braising to microwaving to sous vide – along with over 800 recipes. Everything involved in the creation of a meal from stock to garnish is covered while also placing the dishes within a practical and historical context. In town to promote his new book, Robuchon sat down with The Buzz to talk about the importance of technique, the differences between French and American home cooks, why he's against molecular gastronomy and more. Zagat Buzz: Your cookbook includes both contemporary recipes and ones most French home cooks should already be familiar with. For whom is it intended? Joël Robuchon: This book was written for the general public. The recipes are fairly simple and easy to prepare so that many people can follow them. Of course I also include some more sophisticated recipes, because even the amateur cook likes to do something special! I also wanted to give people the basic savoir-faire or know-how to be able to cook well. A lot of people come into my restaurants and ask, “How did you make that delicious vinaigrette?” or something like that. The recipe is usually quite simple, but it is the technique that makes a difference. ZB: Do you think this is the most approachable cookbook you've ever written? JR: Yes, for sure. The way I designed this book was by picking the 800 recipes that I found to be the most accessible from a list of 2,000, and dividing them up into chapters that are preceded by simple explanations of what the food group is and how best to choose, prepare and cook it. I think I give more information than in any of my previous books, which is helpful to both the amateur and advanced cook. It is practical information that will help people understand how to cook better. ZB: How does the cooking style and method change from restaurant to home? JR: In a restaurant, you have so much more available to you in terms of equipment. You have the option of making a lot more things because you have the tools to do so. At home, however, you are more limited in what you have and therefore what you can make. One thing I have always noticed throughout my years is that Americans always have so much more equipment in the home than the French do. Even now. You walk into an American home kitchen and they have a garlic peeler, an egg cracker and all sorts of gadgets. The average French home cook has a pan, a knife and a whisk. ZB: So would you say that equipment is the main difference between the French and the American home cook? JR: Well it is quite difficult for me to say, because I am not too often in an American home kitchen, but yes, Americans were always ahead with their gadgets. I used to come to the U.S. just to get a meat thermometer because we did not have it in France yet. I was the only chef in France with one at the time when I brought it back. ZB: The subtitle of this book is \"French Home Cooking for the Way We Live Now.\" In what ways has French home cooking changed from the way it was 10, 25 or 50 years ago? JR: Because travel has become much more common and things are transported much easier than in the past, products have become much fresher. If you did not live near the sea 50 or even 25 years ago, it was very difficult to get fresh fish. Now you can get it almost anywhere. Also, in the past, French chefs would hide their meat or produce under thick starchy or creamy sauces, perhaps sometimes to cover up food that is past its prime. Not that I have any problem with cream or butter. Americans tend to shy away from such things because they like to eat healthier, but my family has been eating lots and lots of butter for years and everyone is very old and healthy! But now everything is more pure and you are able to identify foods served to you much easier than in the past. ZB: So, do you think that making all foods readily available anytime, anywhere is always a good thing? JR: No, actually it is quite a paradox. It is good because things are fresher and there is more variety, but it is bad because there are fewer adherences to seasonal foods. I think that older people are able to understand the benefit, both health- and tastewise, of eating seasonally, because at some point it was their only choice. But I am quite surprised to discover that many young people are totally unaware of the season of a certain produce. ZB: Some people complain that cooking at home becomes too expensive if using esoteric ingredients that are barely used and spoil quickly. Did you consider the cook's wallet when designing the recipes in this cookbook? JR: If you open the book and point to a recipe and say 'ok, this is what I am going to cook' and then go out and buy all of those specific ingredients, yes, it will be expensive. But this cookbook is not meant for that. This book supposes that you are cooking regularly and that you will pick a recipe based on what you already have at home, not the other way around. For example, if you have a lot of carrots, find a recipe in the book with carrots. In this fashion, cooking at home most certainly will save you money. ZB: Another cookbook released in the past month is Grant Achatz's Alinea cookbook, which has lots of pretty pictures and recipes that are nearly impossible to replicate at home – unless you keep needles and various chemicals handy. What do you think of so-called molecular gastronomy? JR: Although I do not want to critique anyone or his or her work, I am personally very against it. I have been working very hard for over 20 years to make sure that my products are free from additives or anything unnatural. If you are talking about the kind of molecular gastronomy that uses additives or synthesized products, that to me is unnatural and something that goes against my work and my will. Firstly, because this is a relatively new practice, we have no idea what the long-term affects are of consuming such substances, and I cannot imagine them being good. Also, it seems to me that if a mistake is made in the kitchen while practicing this molecular gastronomy, it could have a grave outcome for the diner. So, no, this is not something that I myself would ever support. ZB: Finally, is there a particular recipe in this book that is nearest to your heart? JR: My mashed potatoes, of course! They are very simple, I just use potatoes, milk and butter, but everyone always asks for more. – Christina Livadiotis

The Oak Room photo: Evan W. Miller The Oak Room photo: Evan W. Miller One of NY’s longest-running venues, the Oak Room, a circa-1907 city landmark in the Plaza Hotel, is back in business following a two-year hiatus; the richly detailed oak paneling has been buffed up, the 20-ft. ceilings are as awe-inspiring as ever and now there’s a new chef added to the mix, Joël Antunes (ex Joël in Atlanta), who’s preparing New American food with French flourishes; in keeping with another enduring tradition, it’s as eye-poppingly pricey as ever. 10 Central Park S.; 212-758-7777 The Oak Room photo: Evan W.

***CONTENT
With Election Day behind us, another great American tradition is rapidly approaching: Thanksgiving. And restaurants are lining up to take on the burden of cooking (and prepping, serving and cleaning) so you can relax this holiday. If none of the 19 Turkey Day options we put forth earlier appealed to you, then take a gander at these 25 Thanksgiving specials. Adour 2 E. 55th St.; 212-710-2277 Alain Ducasse's St. Regis restaurant will be offering a five-course tasting menu that includes duck–foie gras terrine, Maine lobster with chestnut velouté, butternut squash ravioli, roast turkey with old-fashioned stuffing, sweet potatoes, cranberry sauce and a finale of chocolate desserts (5:30–10:30 PM; $135 per person). Alloro 307 E. 77th St.; 212-535-2866 This UES Italian newcomer prides itself on being a family-owned restaurant, so it's bringing familial sensibilities to Turkey Day with a four-course feast of turkey meatballs in veal sauce with fried sage; pumpkin ravioli; and turkey stuffed with prunes in a pumpkin sauce and served with eggplant. Dessert options include chocolate tart with licorice powder and pumpkin tiramisu in peach sauce. The full à la carte dinner menu will be available as well (1:30–9:30 PM; $40 per person). Atlantic Grill 1341 Third Ave.; 212-988-9200 This UES seafood classic is doing turkey for the holiday with a three-course prix fixe featuring a bird with all the fixings. But if you want fish instead, don't worry. The à la carte menu will be available, as will sushi and the raw bar (1–10 PM; $38 per adult; children's turkey plate costs $15). Aureole 34 E. 61st St.; 212-319-1660 Charlie Palmer's mecca is celebrating its last turkey day on the UES (it's set to move to the new Bank of America building by Bryant Park next spring) with a three-course prix fixe that features extensive choices such as crab cake over celery and fennel rémoulade; roasted turkey with traditional garnishes; spice-crusted venison loin with preserved cherry jus; and caramelized scallops with sweet potato gnocchi. Desserts include caramelized pumpkin tart, honeycrisp apple tarte tatin and milk chocolate mousse with peanut butter crunch (2–8:30 PM; $115 for adults, $60 for children). Back Forty 190 Ave. B; 212-388-1990 The younger sibling of Savoy is cooking up a three-course dinner that can be served family-style. On the menu is a cauliflower gratin with cave-aged Gruyère, roasted turkey with cornbread and turkey-sausage stuffing and (for vegetarians) roasted pumpkin stuffed with quinoa and mole. Desserts include apple pie and pecan squares. And if you're still hungry after your family's dinner (really?), you can head to the restaurant after 8 PM when it will be serving a limited à la carte menu (Thanksgiving dinner available from 3–8 PM; $50 per adult; $25 per children under 12; à la carte menu available from 8–10 PM). Bar Americain 152 W. 52nd St.; 212-265-9700 At Bobby Flay's Midtown \"mega-bistro\", the TV toque's crew will be serving a three-course dinner featuring gold corn Johnny cake with barbecue duck and cranberry butter, maple-horseradish-glazed roast turkey with cornbread and wild-mushroom-and-bacon stuffing, Pinot Noir chutney, sweet potato gratin and a toasted pumpkin pound cake with spicy caramel sauce and cream to wrap everything up (1–8 PM; $75 per person). Benoit 60 W. 55th St.; 646-943-7373 For the holiday, Alain Ducasse's newest bistro is serving a four-course prix fixe featuring foie gras on country bread, chestnut-and-lobster velouté, slow roasted turkey with wild mushrooms and cheesecake vacherin. Each diner will also get a bag of housemade lemon marshmallows to take home (seatings 11:30 AM–12:30 PM, 2–3 PM, 5–6 PM and 8–9 PM; $65 per person). Blue Water Grill 31 Union Sq. W.; 212-675-9500 The swanky Union Square seafooder will serve a classic turkey prix fixe of three courses. For those who would rather pardon the birds on the holiday, fear not: the regular menu, sushi and raw bar will all be available (1–10 PM; $38 per person). Braeburn 117 Perry St.; 212-255-0696 Brian Bistrong's New American in the West Village is celebrating its first Thanksgiving with a three-course dinner that includes roasted squash soup with toasted chestnuts, turkey breast and leg with chestnut stuffing and cranberry sauce and more (2–9 PM; $65 per person).

The CB3 Chronicles: Mo Pitkins Gets an Ace, Perbacco Stays Put

***CONTENT
As usual, last night's Community Board 3 SLA meeting went long. The meeting started at 6:30 PM and by 10:30 PM, the agenda for the evening was barely half-finished. Which isn't to say there weren't interesting developments. A few highlights from the first four hours: – The former Mo Pitkins (34 Ave. A) has been sold for $4 million dollars to the corporation that also runs Aces & Eights saloon on the Upper East Side. Though there was some initial concern over the transfer of the license due to past noise problems with the space, after an impassioned speech from one board member in defense of the seller, local restaurateur Phil Hartman of the troubled Two Boots empire, it was quickly approved. – The biggest issue in the first half of the evening came over the details of licensees within the so-called \"resolution area\" in which the community board, with strong support from the local block associations, has decided to not give out any more liquor licenses. Specifically in question was the stretch of Avenue B between Fourth and Fifth Streets. First up in the fight was the Italian Perbacco, which is trying to move from Fourth Street to the former Carne Vale space (46 Ave. B) in order to accommodate the crowds that have come in after a good review in the Times. However, the restaurant apparently hasn't made a good impression on its neighbors over the past six years and that, along with the board's desire not to put more booze on Avenue B, led the restaurant to take its lawyers advice and withdraw its application until a later date. The other restaurant to come up against this issue was a proposed Italian at 40 Ave. B. The applicant (a self-described \"professional, fourth-generation restaurateur\") was interested only in opening with a full liquor license and wouldn't take the board's offer of a beer-only license. And so he was rejected. – Vasmay Lounge had its liquor license transfer approved, but not without a scene. The current owner of the bar, board member David McWater, was attacked by a neighbor who complained aggressively about noise, trash and bad management. However, the woman had never once called 311 to complain, never contacted the police about her concerns, and lost any case she might have had when she, in no uncertain terms, implied the board was in McWater's pocket. In the end, the transfer was approved. – While the board, with the support of the block association, was uninterested in providing a beer and wine license for a new burger joint at 33 St. Marks St., they were quickly (for a community board) persuaded to give a beer license to a struggling Philly cheese steak spot at 191 E. Houston. – The Bowery Hotel apparently has at least one neighbor opposed to its license renewal, but since the hotel has already reached out to alleviate the problem, the license was renewed. – The Cake Shop was granted the right to serve in its upstairs area in addition to its downstairs space. – Ryan's Irish Pub was given permission to alter their facade. Katra got its license renewed and was commended for its much improved behavior over the past two years.

The Russian Tea Room, which is now offering a $35 three-course \"Business Express Lunch\" and also a new $25 plate of three \"Pojarski sliders.\" Named after one of czar Nicholas' favorite chefs, the three different sliders consist of salmon, avocado, tomato and cucumber with rémoulade and pickled onions, veal with comte cheese, wild mushrooms and melted onions, and Kobe beef with black truffles, gruyere cheese and foie gras–caramelized onions, all served with a basket of herb fries. Not the cheapest deal in town, certainly, but more affordable than the restaurant's normal offerings.

With the economy still uncertain, what is the foodie in search of a deal to do? Turn to OpenTable, it seems. The online reservation site (and Zagat partner) has teamed up with area restaurants to launch its \"Appetite Stimulus Plan\" from Monday, November 17th, through Friday, November 21st, during which time participating restaurants will offer three-course lunches for $24 per person and three-course dinners for $35 per person for reservations made through OpenTable. And to further sweeten the pot, registered users will earn an extra 100 Dining Rewards points for each honored Appetite Stimulus reservation. The list of participating restaurants is nothing to scoff at either, including Eleven Madison Park, Asia de Cuba, Bar Blanc and many more. However, do remember to double check that the restaurant you're interested in is participating at the time you'd like, as some are offering the deal only at lunch or dinner. Seating is limited, so book soon and remember you can always make your reservations on your phone with ZAGAT.mobi!

U.S. Turns Up the Heat for Bocuse d'Or
***AUTHOR

***DATE
2009-11-05 00:00:00
***CONTENT
By Jacqueline Wasilczyk, ZAGAT.com staff editor With increased funding and star chef support, Timothy Hollingsworth has high hopes for the Lyon competition. The Bocuse d'Or trophy, modeled after founder Paul Bocuse Photo: courtesy of Bocuse d'Or Created by legendary French chef Paul Bocuse in 1987, the Bocuse d’Or culinary competition has become a way for chefs to prove themselves on an international scale. While it’s not well known in the U.S., Americans have participated for the last 20 years but have never placed better than sixth (in 2003). This year, Bocuse personally invited Thomas Keller and Daniel Boulud to help bolster the American team’s efforts, and there are already signs of progress. In the past, participants had no formal competition training. But now, thanks to increased sponsorship support, Timothy Hollingsworth, The French Laundry sous-chef who won the recent preliminary Bocuse d’Or USA, is taking a paid sabbatical to train in a specially created facility, along with a professional coach, Roland Henin. Zagat Buzz touched base with Daniel Boulud and Timothy Hollingsworth to hear more about why the U.S. has its best shot ever of making it to the winner's podium. Daniel Boulud This Year's Event Known as the “Culinary Olympics,” the 22nd International Bocuse d’Or will take place in Lyon, France, on January 26th–29th. After qualifying rounds, chefs from 25 countries will compete in the three-day challenge for 20,000 euros, a trophy and the title. The centerpiece of the biannual event is a five-hour culinary battle spread across two days, with each chef creating two rehearsed dishes (one fish, one meat) using set key ingredients. This year, ingredients for the first dish include Norwegian cod, prawns and scallops, and for the second, beef tenderloin, oxtail and cheek. Twenty-four international judges evaluate each dish based on taste, presentation and how well it represents the chef’s country of origin. Zagat Buzz: Why did you feel it was important to get involved with the Bocuse d’Or competition? Daniel Boulud: Earlier this year, the honorable chef Paul Bocuse personally invited me to become Chairman of the U.S. team and President d'Honneur of the International Competition. Chef Bocuse has been an incredible role model for me and generations of chefs. This made the invitation alone an honor, especially considering that for a professional competition this is considered one of the most prestigious in the world. I also felt this was an incredible opportunity to show the world, through our young competitors, the caliber of the best cooking in American restaurants today. ZB: What did you hope to bring to the U.S. team when you agreed to become involved in this event? DB: While the U.S. has sent some strong competitors over the last 20 years, the team has not always reflected the high quality of cooking in top American restaurants, and has not had the consistent support of the industry. Along with Thomas Keller, Jerome Bocuse, Michel Bouit (the former director of the U.S. team) and our advisory board, we are working to change that and attract the level of sponsorship [needed] to get a strong team to Lyon with all the resources that [are] required. Norway, whose population is just about that of NYC, spends about $1,000,000 in support of their team for each competition. We have made a good start, but still have a long way to go. Chef Daniel Boulud at the U.S. Bocuse d'Or preliminary Photo: courtesy of Disney ZB: What do you feel is the most important quality in a chef? In what ways does chef Hollingsworth possess those qualities? DB: One single quality is not enough to make a great chef. It takes drive, passion, discipline, energy, consistently high standards, a refined palate, strong technique, creativity and artistry. To win the Bocuse d'Or World Competition in Lyon, a competitor has to be a great chef and has to be incredibly focused, ambitious and hungry to win. It is like the Olympics: natural talent is required, but no one could ever win if they weren't entirely dedicated to training for the big day of competition. Timothy Hollingsworth demonstrated great passion and creativity, but also remained extremely calm and focused [during] the Bocuse d'Or U.S. competition at Epcot. This was a reflection not only of his character, but also the strong foundation of his training. ZB: How will chef Roland Henin be training Hollingsworth? DB: There will be a lot of repetition involved to address the time pressure of the competition. But even more importantly, they will work on refining the flavor and texture of the dishes. The level of perfection and precision required is hard to imagine if you've never seen what's presented at the competition. ZB: What do you think the most challenging part of the competition will be for the American team this year? DB: There are chefs who build their lives around the competition circuit. This is not the case for Timothy, who is a superb restaurant chef, but we believe he can shoulder the challenge and constraints of the competition environment. Timothy Hollingsworth Timothy Hollingsworth after being announced the winner of the U.S. Bocuse. Disney ZB: What personally made it important for you to get involved in this competition? Timothy Hollingsworth: Entering the American competition was a chance for me to explore new challenges and to grow as a chef by thinking about food and cooking under different circumstances than I'm accustomed to. Thomas [Keller’s] excitement and commitment to the organization, combined with the support of my co-workers, motivated me to get involved. ZB: How do you feel your time at The French Laundry has helped you? TH: For the past seven years, I’ve surrounded myself with some of the greatest chefs a person could work for. With Thomas Keller and Corey Lee, you have no choice but to constantly improve. Changing the menu everyday has helped me generate lots of ideas and really think about what can be done with food. ZB: What are you most concerned about in regards to the Bocuse d’Or competition? TH: I'm most concerned about the dish I write. With practice I know that [my commis] Adina [Guest] and I will be able to perform and execute. At the end of the day, it comes down to the dish that I've made and whether or not it’s good enough. ZB: In what ways do you expect cooking in the competition to change your culinary style or technique? TH: I think it will make my cooking more complex. Right now I'm more of a purist; I like simple flavors and showcasing natural ingredients. This competition requires that you manipulate food more than I might do on my own. Hopefully the competition will help me to find a balance in between.

Barbuto 775 Washington St.; 212-924-9700 After the Macy's parade, head down to Jonathan Waxman's West Villager for an Italian twist on the classic Thanksgiving dinner – think winter greens salad with shaved beets and capers, crispy gnocchi with turkey breast, sweet potatoes, roasted cauliflower, pomegranate-cranberry sauce and more. Vegetarian options are available (3–8 PM; $65 per person). Beacon 25 W. 56th St.; 212-332-0500 At Waldy Malouf's Midtown New American, the regular menu will be replaced by a four-course prix fixe that includes pumpkin-apple soup, Northern Atlantic blue point oysters and New York State \"Bourbon Red\" heirloom turkey (1–8 PM; $79 per adult; $35 per child under 10; free for children under four). BLT Market 1430 Sixth Ave.; 212-521-6125 Laurent Tourondel's swanky New American in the Ritz-Carlton Central Park is hosting a three-course holiday prix fixe with starters like white mushroom risotto (white truffles are an additional charge), goat-cheese-and-duck-confit salad and main courses such as roast turkey and bacon-wrapped salmon.

The amuse, first course, side courses and dessert will all be served communally, but each diner will get to choose between traditional turkey or Scottish salmon for the main course (2–8 PM; $115 per adult; $65 per child under 11). Eleven Madison Park 11 Madison Ave.; 212-889-0905 Once again the only Danny Meyer restaurant open for the holiday, this Madison Square Parker will be serving a four-course prix fixe in its art deco halls all day. Included are starters like foie gras torchon with Honey Crisp apples and cinnamon meringue, big eye tuna with pickled butternut squash and pumpkin seed oil and desserts such as Bosc pear tart with chestnuts and bourbon, and a white chocolate crémeux with cranberry confit and cocoa. Main course choices include turkey with butternut squash and cornbread stuffing or seared skate, plus a slew of sides for the whole table (1–8 PM; $135 per person). Five Points 31 Great Jones St.; 212-253-5700 At this always bustling NoHo spot, the Thanksgiving dinner features three courses for each diner as well as cranberry relish, Brussels sprouts with pearl onions and garlic mashed potatoes to share. Main courses include a roast turkey with giblet gravy and cornbread stuffing and a red-wine-and-port-braised beef short rib, not to mention various desserts and vegetarian options (2–8 PM; $60 per adult; $30 per child under 12). Fleur de Sel 5 E. 20th St.; 212-460-9100 Though the details are still being decided, Cyril Renaud's Flatiron French goes American for the day, serving the traditional turkey in its two Thanksgiving prix fixe menus that are both available all day (12:30–9 PM; $85 per person for three courses; $102 per person for five courses). Hill Country 30 W. 26th St.; 212-255-4544 Order your whole pit-smoked turkey to go at this bustling Chelsea roadhouse.

Hundred Acres 38 MacDougal St.; 212-475-7500 At this SoHo New American newcomer, the key word on Thanksgiving will be tradition. The restaurant is planning a four-course prix fixe traditional turkey dinner with all that it entails (2–8 PM; $50 per adult; $25 for children 12 and under). Le Cirque & Osteria del Circo Le Cirque, 151 E. 58th St.; 212-644-0202 Osteria del Circo, 120 W. 55th St.; 212-265-3636 Celebrate the holiday with the Maccionis – Le Cirque is offering a turkey-loving four-course menu all day (noon–8 PM; $105 per person), while the more family-oriented Osteria is doing the same and has a children's menu on hand (1–9 PM; $68 per adult; $25 per child under 12).

Momofuku Ssäm Bar 207 Second Ave.; 212-254-3500 David Chang's people will cook your Thanksgiving dinner, but you'll have to eat it at home because they only do take out for the holiday. Serving up to eight people, the Momofuku dinner may not have any turkey, but it does feature bo ssäm (a whole slow-roasted pork shoulder), apple stuffing, fried Brussels sprouts, sweet potato pureé and cashew-blondie pie ($285; to see the full menu click here; to order call 212-228-0031 or e-mail catering@momofuku.com).

Zenkichi Opens Winter Garden

Zenkichi's new winter garden photo: Courtesy of Zenkichi It’s not often that we get to write about a restaurant opening a garden in November, but then Zenkichi in Williamsburg never does things the usual way – what other eatery in New York has call buttons for waiters? The Japanese izakaya has just opened its enclosed winter garden, adding some extra seating to the multi floor restaurant. Husband-and-wife owners Motoko Watanabe and Shaul Margulies say the inspiration was “a Japanese mountain retreat” and that the garden created a few design challenges: “We have two big trees that we wanted to work with instead of cutting down,\" explains Margulies, \"and hopefully the natural feel is embedded in the space.\" He's also excited about the garden's glass ceiling, \"I'm anticipating the first snow ‘look' – I think that'll be a highlight.” But the garden isn’t the only change Zenkichi is contemplating – the duo are currently scouting spaces for a potential relocation to Manhattan sometime in the future. Says Margulies, “The idea is to stay roughly the same size and price range, but to eliminate the three-floor ordeal of running up and down all night long. We also plan on making the seating area a bit more private and luxurious.”

By Liz Borod Wright, ZAGAT.com senior web editor Marathon spectators get hungry, too. Here are 26 eateries along the 26.2-mile course. Courtesy of New York Road Runners The 39,000 runners who will compete in the ING New York City Marathon on Sunday get all the glory – not to mention the free water, flavored power gels and pasta dinners to keep them going. But what about the two-million-plus hungry and thirsty spectators who cheer them on all day? They need fueling too. If you'll be playing cheerleader that day, here are 26 possible pit stops for noshing at strategic spots along the 26.2-mile course. Mile 2 Tanoreen 7704 Third Ave. (bet. 77th & 78th Sts.), Brooklyn, 718-748-5600 This Med–Middle Eastern in Bay Ridge opens at 10:30 AM – 20 minutes after the runners take off across the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge from Staten Island. Mile 6 Belleville 350 Fifth Ave. (5th St.), Brooklyn, 718-832-9777 Plenty of New Yorkers consider brunching a sport, so get your game on at this low-key local favorite. Chocolate Room 86 Fifth Ave. (bet. St. Marks Pl. & Warren St.), Brooklyn, 718-783-2900 If it's cold out, warm up with one of this Park Slope cafe's four different kinds of hot chocolate. Mile 7 Press 195 195 Fifth Ave. (bet. Sackett & Union Sts.), Brooklyn, 718-857-1950 The picky eaters in your group will welcome this Park Slope shop's endless panini combinations (as well as tasty salads). Nana 155 Fifth Ave. (bet. Lincoln & St. Johns Pls.), Brooklyn, 718-230-3749 With its versatile menu offering everything from sushi to Thai, this friendly Park Slope Asian fusioner is also a good choice for a group. Mile 8 Thomas Beisl 25 Lafayette Ave. (Ashland Pl.), Brooklyn, 718-222-5800 Duck into this Austrian gem's beer garden for a respite from the throngs of spectators who gather near the Brooklyn Academy of Music. Olea 171 Lafayette Ave. (Adelphi St.), Brooklyn, 718-643-7003 Take a break from cheering by having brunch at this Ft. Greene Med right on the course at Lafayette Avenue. Mile 10 Roebling Tea Room 143 Roebling St. (Metropolitan Ave.), Brooklyn, 718-963-0760 This edgy Billyburg tearoom with graffiti-style artwork offers WiFi, so if your runner friend gave you her racing number, you can visit www.nycmarathon.org and see where she is on the course. Mile 11 Fornino 187 Bedford Ave. (N. 7th St.), Brooklyn, 718-384-6004 Don't even think of trying to cross the race at Bedford Avenue – there's no point when you can eat at this innovative Williamsburg pizzeria on the block's east side. Bonita 338 Bedford Ave. (bet. S. 2nd & 3rd Sts.), Brooklyn, 718-384-9500 Staking out the west side of Bedford? Then check out this budget-friendly Williamsburg Mexican with cool retro decor. Mile 13 Manducatis 13-27 Jackson Ave. (47th Ave.), Queens, 718-729-4602 Carbo-load like a runner on pastas at this old-world LIC eatery. Water's Edge East River & 44th Dr. (Vernon Blvd.), Queens, 718-482-0033 It doesn't open until 5:30 PM, but this seafooder's breathtaking views of the Manhattan skyline are worth the wait. Mile 16 Bistro 61 1113 First Ave. (61st St.), Manhattan, 212-223-6220 After experiencing the only-in-New-York moment of witnessing hordes of runners cross the 59th Street Bridge into Manhattan, take a (very) quick trip to Paris at this old-school French bistro. Café Evergreen 1288 First Ave. (bet. 69th & 70th Sts.), Manhattan, 212-744-3266 Following a quick lunch of authentic dim sum, you can get right back out there and cheer on the runners, who still have 10 miles to go. Mile 17 Iron Sushi 355 E. 78th St. (bet. 1st & 2nd Aves.), Manhattan, 212-772-7680 First Avenue is one of the most popular places to watch the race, so head off the thoroughfare to this less-trafficked side street for inexpensive yet high-quality sushi.

(bet. 5th & 6th Aves.), Manhattan, 212-826-5959 Visit the newest location of this classic, midpriced Central Park South bruncher, right on the tail end of the race route. Mile 26 Bouchon Bakery 10 Columbus Circle, 3rd fl. (60th St. at B'way), Manhattan, 212-823-9366 Look out on the runners re-entering the park as they head toward the finish line at Tavern on the Green while you savor sumptuous pastries, soups and salads à la Thomas Keller; plus, you can use the bathrooms at the Time Warner Center. Lobby Lounge Mandarin Oriental, 80 Columbus Circle, Manhattan, 212-805-8800 Although the marathoners may look like ants from its lofty perch, the Mandarin Oriental's 35th-floor lounge serves up breathtaking views of Central Park, as well as light fare beginning at 11 AM and tea service at 2:30 PM.

Tasting a Slice of Staten Island Life

A pizza at Joe & Pat's photo: Garth Johnston Staten Island has long had an image problem. Though Fresh Kills has been closed for years, the dump is still what most folks associate with this forgotten borough. But the times, they are a changin'. This summer Gray Line introduced a Staten Island tour. Now SINY, a local group conceived to bolster the borough's reputation, is kicking off a twice-monthly series of local pizza tours showcasing the best of the local-style thin-crust pies available over the Verrazano bridge. The tours don't begin until November 8th, but the Buzz was lucky enough to tag along on a preveiw. Designed to both highlight the borough's unique character as well as its flavors, the tour departs at 11 AM from the Ferry Terminal (next to the awesome Staten Island Yankees stadium) and makes stops for pizza and drinks at four legends: Jimmy Max (280 Watchogue Rd; 718-983-6715), Joe & Pat's, Denino's Pizzeria and Lee's Tavern (60 Hancock St.; 718-667-9749). While all of the pizza was thin-crust, Joe & Pat's was the thinnest of all and the dough had almost a matzo-meal taste. Lee's, which has an old school–tavern setting with original tin ceilings, had the thickest pies of the bunch, but even those were still quite thin. Between slices, diners got a chance to digest during detours to visit the Staten Island Zoo, the South Beach area and other attractions. A local guide is on hand for the whole tour to make sure you know that CSI isn't just a TV show but also the College of Staten Island, that the neighborhood St. George has nothing to do with the dragon slayer and some Islanders are still bitter about \"the Bridge.\" If you've ever wanted to explore Staten Island beyond the ferry terminal, you'll be hard pressed to find a better tasting option (Saturdays 11 AM–3 PM; $40 per person, includes a a commemorative t-shirt and a slice and soda from each establishment; 347-273-1257).

Nina and Tim Zagat's WSJ Op-Ed: People Still Have to Eat
***AUTHOR
BuzzEditor
***DATE

***CONTENT
By Nina Zagat and Tim Zagat Many restaurants will weather a bad economy just fine. In the last few weeks, a lot of people have asked us how the current economic meltdown will affect America's restaurants. The short-term answer is that the crisis is already having an impact. We've recently surveyed 45,000 restaurant-goers nationwide. One-third told us that they're eating out less, 28% say they're visiting less expensive places, and roughly 20% are cutting back on alcohol, appetizers and dessert. Also, the number of restaurant openings has slowed. This year in New York City, there were 119 openings versus 163 last year. Another grim sign: Companies are limiting entertaining at restaurants. One thing's for sure – Bear Stearns and Lehman aren't giving any holiday parties. Despite all this, we predict that the long-term future of the industry will not be bleak – just different. When Zagat Survey began 30 years ago, the country was in its first \"energy crisis,\" with interest rates scraping 20%. Nonetheless, America's restaurants flourished. After October 1987's Black Monday and again after 9/11, the industry took an immediate hit, but then bounced back stronger than ever. Throughout all three recessions, restaurant openings exceeded closings. Why? Besides the fact we all have stomachs to fill, we've also been in the midst of a long-term social revolution that has led to unprecedented growth in the frequency of dining out for both business and pleasure. The engines of that growth haven't changed. To start with, more and more women have joined the workforce over the years. Thus, in most families, no one regularly has the time to shop, cook and clean up afterwards. Second, our tax laws continue to favor eating out for business. Last, the Immigration Act of 1965 led to a diversification of inexpensive, ethnic cuisines. Today roughly 50% of all meals consumed around the U.S. are prepared outside the home. As a result, we've witnessed the exponential growth of what we call Better Alternative to Home (BATH) restaurants – casual, modestly priced eateries (pasta-rias, burger joints, BBQs, upscale diners, noodle shops and myriad ethnic places) as well as family dining chains. These restaurants buy wholesale and produce meals far more efficiently than home cooks. In city after city, our surveys show that high-end restaurants are a small minority relative to BATHs. That helps explain the industry's low overall inflation rate in recent decades. As we measure it, the average cost of a meal increased by less than half of the Consumer Price Index since 1979. The current downturn will no doubt pressure restaurants to offer an even greater value proposition. Expect to see more low-priced prix-fixe meals. In New York, over 100 restaurants offer fixed-price lunch menus in the $20 range. Another approach is the small-plates menu, which allows the customer to eat less and pay less. Also plan on seeing more bargain-priced specials. Short of a full-scale depression, it's unlikely that our economic woes will dampen the excitement about food and dining that has become part of our cultural fabric over the past three decades. TV shows, feature films, food magazines, blogs and chef-labeled products have all helped fuel this consuming passion. The financial downturn may have an upside for restaurants. In the throes of the Great Depression, Americans turned to entertainment – especially the movies – to forget their troubles. Today, for a generation that has grown up on The Food Network, dining out with friends or family in an attractive restaurant has become a source of comfort and entertainment. Thanks to all these factors, we believe that restaurants will weather the current environment better than many predict, and BATH restaurants will flourish as diners look for homey, hearty, reasonably priced fare. High-end places – especially those that offer value as well as quality – will be able to keep their reservation books full, if not as profitably as before. The bottom line is that the economy may convince you to forego buying the Lexus or taking that jaunt to Maui, but at the end of the day (and at its start and in the middle too), you gotta eat. This editorial originally appeared in the Wall Street Journal on October 30, 2008.

Old Homestead Retrenches

***CONTENT
Old Homestead, one of the oldest steakhouses in the city (it opened in 1868), is about to shake up its dining rooms. According to owner Marc Sherry, the restaurant is about to undergo a $2.2 million renovation which will be finished by January 1st, and they will do it all without closing. At the heart of the renovation is the restaurant giving up the lease on its dining room located in an adjacent building. Rather than pay an \"exorbitant\" rent increase, the chophouse is retooling its main building (which it owns) into three floors of dining rooms. Currently the second floor is only used for private parties and the third floor is office space. The restaurant will actually gain seats with this renovation. And in any event, this has all happened before: the steakhouse used to have a dining room in its other neighboring building until rents pushed them out and Pop Burger in.

photo: Luis Yax With Halloween falling on a Friday this year (and with warmer weather projected for tomorrow), debauchery all around town – especially near the Village's infamous parade – is pretty much guarranteed. If you're still figuring out your All Hallow's Eve plans, here are a few spots hosting parties and costume contests to consider. Hill Country 30 West 26th St.; 212-255-4544 The party starts at 10 PM at this Chelsea BBQ joint when country blues band Five Points takes the downstairs stage with no cover. While they play, revelers can enjoy the restaurant's regular menu along with $4 \"Scream and Go Crazy\" punch, $2 Jello shots and additional drink specials. There will be a prize-filled costume contest starting at 11 PM. Hudson River Café 697 W. 133rd St.; 212-491-9111 This Harlem seafooder is getting haunted for the holiday with a masquerade ball. From 10 PM until closing, it will boast a live DJ with no cover, along with $1,000 in prizes for the best costumes. If that isn't enough, there will also be a slew of Halloween food and drink specials on hand. Johnny Utah's 25 W. 51st St., downstairs; 212-265-8824 In conjunction with Venom Energy Drink, this Midtown BBQ joint known for its mechanical bull is throwing a Halloween party. Costumes are mandatory (bull wrangler, anyone?) and the guest with the best costume wins a year's supply of Venom. The party starts at 10 PM, and for the first hour there will be an open vodka bar ($20 per person). Sanctuary T 337B W. Broadway; 212-941-7832 Just blocks from the infamous Halloween Parade, this SoHo tea spot (which serves the harder stuff too) is pitching itself as the ideal spot to meet up before going to watch the festivities. From 5–7 PM, it'll be offering two-for-one pre-parade drink specials to get you in the reveling mood. The restaurant will also be introducing a new cocktail, the Flaming Cocktail (a burning rum-and-Coke concoction that is literally on fire), and hosting a costume contest. The winner of the contest will get a $100 gift certificate and their picture displayed on the restaurant's \"wall of fame.\" Yerba Buena 23 Ave. A; 212-529-2919 The entire staff of this East Village Pan-Latin spot will be in costume for the holiday, serving up specials from chef Julian Medina like hamachi ceviche, duck ropa with pumpkin purée and coffee-glazed flan with ancho chile. There will also be a $250 prize for the guest in the best costume.

Fiamma With the economy the way it is these days, even the more expensive spots are looking for ways to give diners a break. SoHo's extravagant Italian Fiamma, for instance, is enticing diners with that old-school Florida fallback, the early bird special. Mondays through Thursdays, chef Fabio Trabocchi will be whipping up three-course prix fixe dinners for just $50 per person from 5:30–6:30 PM, a steal considering a regular three-course prix fixe there normally costs $85 (212-653-0100).

Steak from A.J. Maxwell. Courtesy of A.J.

Maxwell's 57 W. 48th St.; 212-262-6200 Among the $30 lunch specials at this Rockefeller Center restaurant: a petite filet mignon that comes with mashed potatoes and spinach, or a petite sirloin steak served with peppercorn sauce and french fries.

Del Frisco's 1221 Sixth Ave.; 212-575-5129 For $31 this Midtown chophouse will serve you a salad or soup, a 6-oz. filet mignon with potatoes and your choice of dessert.

Todd English Todd English (Olives) just can't get enough of New York City. Though the celebrity chef just opened The Libertine on Gold Street in September, we have it on good authority that he is already sniffing around town for another restaurant. Specifically, according to the chef himself, he and his team have been \"scouting\" 325 Bowery, the mercurial former Kelley and Peng space on the corner of 2nd Street and the Bowery. (In the time since Kelley and Peng finally gave up the ghost, the space has been the East Village Yacht Club, hosted NBC's upcoming reality show Chopping Block, been home to a never-opened Italian restaurant and been one of Target's Pop-up Bullseye Bodegas.) While we aren't holding our breath to see English's toque on the Bowery (we're still waiting for Daniel Boulud's burger joint), we thought it was noteworthy enough to mention.

Madam Geneva photo: Ryan Charles Adjacent to the restaurant Double Crown, the new Bowery bar/lounge Madam Geneva is a cool, sexy nexus from the AvroKO design team, decorated in a vaguely British Raj style; the simple drinks list offers some interesting beers and wines, but the specialty of the house is gin or vodka poured onto crushed ice, then topped with housemade preserves; fun fact: the name is 18th-century British slang for gin. 4 Bleecker St.; 212-254-0350 Madam Geneva photo: Ryan Charles

The UWS Shake Shack photo: Justin Hartung After months of waiting, the city's food bloggers rejoiced across the Internet this week when Danny Meyer's beloved Madison Square Park burger joint, Shake Shack, opened a second outpost on the Upper West Side. In case you haven't been following, the facts are these: located across the street from the American Museum of Natural History in the old Jacques-Imo's space, it brings the charms of the original indoors – those charms being one of the best burgers in the city, often epic lines, various \"concretes\" and a nice selection of wine and beer – and adds to the mix a private room downstairs for parties, lots of parking for your strollers and two bathrooms you don't have to pay to use. If you liked the original but weren't a fan of the trek downtown or the lengthy outdoor waits, you should be pleased. And if you haven't had a chance to try the infamous Shack burger, now you'll have an easier time (366 Columbus Ave.; no phone yet).

It's Showtime for the Lincoln Center Neighborhood

***CONTENT
Time was when Lincoln Center seemed caught in a time warp. True, the neighborhood did contain some classic, even beloved, NYC eateries – but therein lay the rub: nothing much new in the way of dining or drinking ever seemed to be happening around the city’s primo performing-arts complex. When planning a pre- or post-curtain meal, a seasoned culture vulture might well have likened his options to that 30-year-old production of La Bohème at the Met: still lovely, of course – but wouldn’t a fresh experience be nice? Now, though, as the fall arts season gets underway, the area is humming with a newfound energy – despite the unstable economy. Even as Lincoln Center itself undergoes renovation, all around it new apartment buildings are going up and traffic islands are being spruced up. Several swank stores have sprouted branches in the upper 60s and low 70s, including Brooks Brothers, SEE Eyewear, Space NK.apothecary and Reiss UK. And when a chic cupcake boutique like Magnolia Bakery chooses to open its first spin-off at Columbus and 69th Street, you know a neighborhood’s arrived. The dining scene appears revitalized as well, with fresh faces juxtaposed among the familiar ones. At Bar Boulud, Daniel Boulud’s rustic French bistro fare now resides a few streets down from Gallic classic Café des Artistes. The drinking crowd can either head up to the Lobby Bar of the refurbished Empire Hotel, or descend beneath street level to established hideaway Shalel Lounge. The Time Warner Center, right in the center of Columbus Circle (within easy walking distance of Lincoln Center) hosts a cornucopia of venues in various price ranges, the latest being the wine bar Clo. And for those who worry about curtain times, there are some fresh options in the Lincoln Center complex itself: a new wine bar/small plates venue in Avery Fisher Hall, fittingly named Arpeggio Food and Wine, and a new Italian menu, devised by chef Umberto Montano (Florence’s Alle Murate), for the Grand Tier restaurant in the Metropolitan Opera House. Here’s a rundown of places to dine and drink, both familiar favorites and promising newcomers. Spanning the upper 50s to the lower 70s, between Columbus Avenue and Central Park West, they are all close to Lincoln Center, and accustomed to getting you to the show on time. – Troy Segal Map of Lincoln Center View: Restaurants Bars Hotels Restaurants view map A Amber 221 Columbus Ave. (70th St.) B Asiate 80 Columbus Circle, 35th fl.

***CONTENT
In these turbulent economic times, a trip to Paris is out of the question for most of us. Even going out for dinner at a French restaurant can feel like an unwarranted splurge. But some French bistros offer prix fixe dinner deals that are such great bargains you can't afford to stay home and cook. Here are five multicourse dinners from the 2009 New York City Restaurants guide that cost $28 or less. Bacchus 409 Atlantic Ave.; 718-852-1572 At this little Boerum Hill bistro, diners won't feel limited by the three-course prix fixe option ($25), as they'll be choosing between four starters, four entrees and numerous desserts. Cafe Loup 105 W. 13th St.; 212-255-4746 This Greenwich Village bistro is a neighborhood standby that's worth the trip if you're not a local, as it offers great atmosphere and three courses for $28. Demarchelier 50 E. 86th St.; 212-249-6300 Don't be scared off by its tony Upper East Side address – it offers one of the best deals in town: two courses and a glass of wine for $26. La Bonne Soupe 48 W. 55th St.; 212-586-7650 At this Midtown bistro known for its namesake soup as well as for crêpes, diners get the same deal for dinner as they do for lunch: three courses for $23.95. La Petite Auberge 116 Lexington Ave.; 212-689-5003 If you're really hungry, head to this quaint Gramercy French bistro where you can get four courses and a cup of coffee for $28.

***CONTENT
In 1979 Tim and Nina Zagat compiled their friends' opinions on New York restaurants into a single-sheet mimeographed guide. Thirty years later, Zagat Survey publishes more than 50 books covering everything from dining to movies to golf courses. And that, we think, is worth celebrating. We've built a special 30th birthday site to share our memories, where you can check out the very first Survey, read about how the food scene has changed or test your knowledge with our dining crossword. Since we'd have never gotten here without our loyal readers and surveyors, we thought it would be more fun to celebrate with you. Every day over the next year we'll be giving away 30 gifts (as in a perfect Zagat score of 30) to folks who sign up on our contest webpage. Prizes range from cool gear like a \"Zagat Rated\" apron to a free dinner for two at the restaurant of your choice. And, as the saying goes, that's not all: everyone who enters the daily contest is automatically entered into our Grand Prize raffle, the winner of which gets a free trip for two to Paris including airfare, hotel and dining expenses. Mon dieu!

Restaurants love to celebrate their birthdays – not surprising considering how rough a business it can be. Some celebrate with drastic price roll-backs (especially when they are turning 100 or so), some celebrate by roasting a whole cow on the street and some just try to give a little something special to their regulars. The Midtown restaurant Brasserie 8½ falls firmly into the last category. To celebrate eight-and-a-half years, executive chef Julian Alonzo is offering diners an eight-and-a-half-course prix fixe served two courses at a time for $28.50 per person, starting at lunch on November 10th and going through dinner November 17th. The restaurant will also be offering an \"8½ cocktail\" (prosecco, Grand Marnier and blood orange purée garnished with an orange chocolate) for $8.50 and a series of \"petits plats,\" small plates of some of the restaurants classics, also for $8.50 (212-829-0812). Check out the full 8½ anniversary menu after the jump 8 ½ Anniversary Menu 8 ½ Course Tasting $28.50 per person Amuse Bouche: Duck Consommé, Jalapeño, Baby Vegetables Pork Belly Croque Madame, Scallions, Avocado Short Rib Pot au Feu, Cabbage, Fleur de Sel Squab a L'Orange, Braised Endive, Pomme Soufflé Escargots with Garlic Butter, Lamb Sausage Grilled Sardines Pan Bagnat, Pine Nuts, Black Olives, Prosciutto, Tartar Sauce Sautéed Skate, Brown Butter, Capers, Pineapple Vanilla Crème Caramel, Fresh Berries Frozen Banana Praline Soufflé, Caramel Sauce Petits Plats, $8.50 each Amuse Bouche: Duck Consommé, Jalapeño, Baby Vegetables Escargots with Garlic Butter, Lamb Sausage Short Rib Pot au Feu, Cabbage, Fleur de Sel Steak Tartare, Quail Egg Sunnyside Up, Lillet Gelee Pork Belly Croque Madame, Scallions, Avocado Squab a L'Orange, Braised Endive, Pomme Soufflé Grilled Sardines Pan Bagnat, Pine Nuts, Black Olives, Prosciutto, Tartar Sauce Sautéed Skate, Brown Butter, Capers, Pineapple Frisée aux Lardons, Roasted Figs, Pena Blanca Cheese Onion Soup Gratinée, Bacon, Gruyère, Country Bread Roasted Beets, Walnuts, Roquefort Cheese Croutons Plum and Honey Buttermilk Coupe, Ginger Snap, Candied Walnuts Frozen Banana Praline Soufflé, Caramel Sauce Vanilla Crème Caramel, Fresh Berries Crème Brulée Cheese Course: Camembert, Apples, Toasted Brioche

Vegetarians, look away! While at this point New Yorkers have gotten used to the idea of a restaurant roasting a whole pig in the street to celebrate an event, are we ready for a whole cow? On Saturday and Sunday, October 25th–26th, the East Village's Sunburnt Cow is celebrating its five years of serving fare from Down Under by spit-roasting an entire cow in a trailer outside the restaurant. Those who show up either day can stuff themselves silly on free roast beef and sides. And if you want to drink, you won't be disappointed either. For only $20 you can enjoy \"all-you-can-drink\" for two hours (incidentally, that's the same as the weekday happy hour special). There will also be a \"toss the boss\" coin toss competition every two hours where you can win a chance to have you and up to five friends eat at the restaurant for free (noon–midnight both days; 137 Ave. C; 212-529-0005).

Women Chefs Dish at the Table

Butter's Alex Guarnaschelli (right) Photo: Michael Tulipan Last night the Buzz attended At the Table, a fund-raiser thrown by Women Chefs & Restaurateurs in support of the education and advancement of women in culinary fields. In her opening speech, chef Bonnie Moore, who sits on the WCR's board of directors, pointed out that though women make up more than 50% of the food service industry, only 7% occupy top restaurant jobs. Fortunately, a good number of that 7% participated in last night's event, and a few hits from the tasting tables included the lobster roll from Rebecca Charles (Pearl Oyster Bar), seared beef tongue salad from Lee Anne Wong (French Culinary Institute) and pumpkin cheesecake from Nancy Olson (Gramercy Tavern). In between all that noshing, the Buzz managed to catch up with a few chefs to see how they're coping in the current economic crisis. Butter's executive chef Alex Guarnaschelli shared that her secret to maintaining a successful restaurant is a belief that \"making food people crave supersedes economic hardship.\" And on the topic of future restaurant openings, Anita Lo (Annisa, Bar Q) questioned whether chefs \"would be allowed to open anything\" over the next few years. While it's true that grand-scale openings may be on the wane for the immediate future, rising female talent will only continue to increase in the kitchen, thanks to the scholarships and internship programs WCR helps sponsor.

Diners order via touch-screens at Philippe Chow Express. photo: Courtesy of Philippe Chow Express Following the example of the ATM machine and the self-serve gas pump, restaurateurs around the world have increasingly been incorporating automated components into the dining experience. By doing so, they reduce staff needs in these rough economic times – and further prove the prophetic genius of The Jetsons. For example, take Philippe Chow Express, Philippe's new West Village spin-off, where patrons order their dishes from a touch-screen menu. From computerized wine kiosks to sushi-laden conveyor belts, here are some more ways that restaurants are using technology to encourage guests to DIY. Adour: At the NYC location of Alain Ducasse’s haute French restaurant, bar patrons browse the wine list (complete with tasting notes) via an interactive menu projected onto a touch-screen bar top. Bamn!: This bright-pink spot in NYC’s East Village brings back the days of the Automat, with coin-operated machines vending pork buns and mini-burgers. Clo: At this wine bar in NYC’s Time Warner Center, choices are made via a motion-activated list and then patrons fill their glasses from automatic dispensers using prepaid credit cards. Evo Bistro: Thirty-two wines are available in three different sizes from the automatic dispenser at this Med bistro in McLean, VA. Inamo: At this quirky London newcomer, diners can choose their own food and drinks, play digital Battleship and even order a taxi home via a touch screen. Isobune: Diners at this SF sushi spot catch their own fish as it floats by on a moat. Luckyfish: Lucille Ball would feel right at home at this LA sushi restaurant where patrons snag their dinner as it passes by on conveyor belts. Pod: Not only does the sushi pass by on a conveyor belt at this Philadelphia spot, diners can choose between nine different colors to illuminate their “pod” seating. Sakae Sushi: This conveyor-belt sushi chain has already conquered Asia, and now it's set its sights on NYC. uWink: With locations in SoCal and the Bay Area, this Californian chain by the founder of Atari (and Chuck E. Cheese) lets diners order at interactive tabletops, which double as multiplayer game consoles. – Justin Hartung

Yesterday, a hungry crowd showed up to listen to a discussion of food criticism in the age of blogging at the NYC Wine and Food Festival. Our very own Nina Zagat moderated a lively exchange between New York Magazine's Insatiable Food critic Gael Greene, Le Bernardin chef Eric Ripert and Citysearch's Josh Ozersky. Topics ranged from how things have changed for critics and guides over the past 40 years (\"The great restaurants were French and designed to make you feel stupid if you didn't speak French,\" reminisced Greene, \"[critics] used to be able to guide people to a sensual experience they didn't already know\") to how critics and prominent bloggers are treated while dining out (\"There is nothing worse than asking for a table for two and getting a table for two rather than a booth for six,\" half-joked Greene). Ripert weighed in on the role of the high-profile chef in the kitchen: \"The chef is more like the conductor. He's not cutting every carrot.\" As for the future of restaurant criticism, there was a general consensus that the fascination with opening-night reviews wasn't good for anyone, neither the consumers who want to know what it would really be like to dine there nor for the restaurants themselves.

***CONTENT
We recently heard about an event in Boston that left us wondering. UpStairs on the Square, a popular restaurant in Cambridge, is hosting a dinner with vegan wine pairings. What is vegan wine? Being made from grapes, wine seems like it would be an acceptable choice for those who had sworn off animal products. Well, according to animal-rights activism group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), during the filtration process of regular wines, isinglass (a pure form of gelatin derived from fish bladders) and egg whites are occasionally used as finings to remove sediment or impurities. Vegan wine, however, uses inert clay powder bentonite or the mineral kaolin instead. Currently there are roughly 20 certified brands of vegan wine, with the easy-to-find Yellowtail brand being one of them.

photo: Christina Livadiotis Unless you don't eat meat, it's hard not to love the hamburger. A perfectly made combination of tender ground beef and just-right bun is one of life's great pleasures – especially when paired with crisp french fries. But where to find the best ones? For that kind of major decision we turned to the 38,128 people who voted in this year's NYC survey. And so we present the Top Burgers in New York, fresh from the 2009 New York City Restaurants guide: DuMont/DuMont Burger DuMont; 432 Union Ave., Brooklyn; 718-486-7717 DuMont Burger; 314 Bedford Ave., Brooklyn; 718-384-6127 Williamsburgers can “stop cooking at home” thanks to this “easygoing joint” serving “artful” yet “cheap” New American standards; a “hip crowd” convenes in the “inviting” interior or “Zen-like garden”, or hits the Bedford Avenue mini spin-off for “awesome” burgers and sandwiches. Shake Shack Madison Square Park, 23rd St.; 212-889-6600 “Brilliant” burgers and hot dogs plus “shakes worth every calorie” add up to pure “magic” at this Madison Square Park alfresco “treat”, now open year ’round and soon to expand to the UWS and beyond; one “negative” – “half the planet” is “on line”, so “check their webcam” or “be prepared” for a “monumental” wait. burger joint at Le Parker Meridien 119 W. 56th St.; 212-708-7414 For “top-class burgers” in the “most unlikely” setting, check out this “old-school” hamburger joint incongruously “tucked away behind a curtain” in a “swank” Midtown hotel lobby; while the chow scores well, the “intimidating service”, “lowbrow decor”, “minimal seating” and “unbearable” lunch lines don’t; P.S. the secret’s out, “even Oprah knows.” Corner Bistro 331 W. Fourth St.; 212-242-9502 “Grimy” decor is “part of the charm” at this “genuine” Village tavern famed for its “thick”, “messy” burgers, “paper-plate” china and “dirt-cheap beer”; expect “long lines” of “frat boys” with “impending hangovers” who don’t mind the “military service” or “truck stop restrooms.” Island Burgers & Shakes 766 Ninth Ave.; 212-307-7934 Big “messy burgers” with a “seemingly infinite choice of toppings” washed down with “dreamy shakes” are the hooks at this surf-themed Hell’s Kitchen “staple”; “low costs” distract from the “no-frills” decor and the much-lamented “lack of french fries.” J.G. Melon 1291 Third Ave.; 212-744-0585 The burgers and cottage fries blow away the rest of the “buttoned-down comfort-food” menu offered at this longtime UES pub; despite “cranky” staffers and a “cash-only” rule, it’s a “preppy” magnet thanks to its “college-days”-meets-“country-club” aura. Still not enough burger fun for you? Check out our Midtown Burger Tour. Or, for more NYC Top Lists, click here.

As the markets continue to fluctuate wildly around the world, a person could be excused for really wanting a drink. But just because you're tippling doesn't mean you can't be helping out a good cause too. So it's nice to see that West Village sorta-speakeasy Employees Only is giving 10% of its proceeds this Sunday night to Chemo Comfort, a local charity which provides cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy with a care package to help them cope (October 12, 8 PM–4 AM; 212-242-3021).

The 2nd Ave. Deli is one of many Kosher restaurants in New York. photo: Ryan Charles With the Jewish high holidays in full swing – Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement, begins at sundown – it seems as good a time as any to talk Kosher. So if you're looking for somewhere to break the fast, or are just a fan of food prepared to strict standards, we suggest you consider these Top Kosher spots from our just released 2009 New York Restaurants guide: Chennai Garden 129 E. 27th St.; 212-689-1999 “Solid vegetarian” food that’s “kosher to boot” is yours at this “tasty” Gramercy Parker where the “spicy” South Indian specialties come out “quick and easy” (not to mention “cheaply”); though there’s “not much decor”, the $6.95 all-you-can-eat lunch buffet more than compensates. 2nd Ave Deli 162 E. 33rd St.; 212-689-9000 Recently transplanted to Murray Hill, this black-and-white-tiled kosher deli remake “captures the spirit of the famous original” with the same “mile-high” pastrami sandwiches (“do I eat it or climb it?”) and “gruff” service; the “cramped” interior accounts for the “out-the-door lines” at prime times. Mill Basin Kosher Deli 5823 Ave. T, Brooklyn; 718-241-4910 “Humongous sandwiches” are the signature of this “quality kosher deli” in Mill Basin, a “throwback” for “delish” “Jewish specialties” that doubles as a “fine art” gallery with “Ertés and Lichtensteins” on display; maybe it’s all that culcha that accounts for prices “on the high side.” Prime Grill 60 E. 49th St.; 212-692-9292 “You don’t need” to be observant to partake in the “kosher power scene” at this “manly” Midtown steakhouse “jammed” with expense-accounters downing “excellent” beef and sushi; sure, it’s “loud” and the “tables are packed too close”, but for most it’s purely prime. Pongal 1154 First Ave.; 212-355-4600 110 Lexington Ave.; 212-696-9458 “Out-of-this-world dosas” and other “savory” dishes make this East Side twosome “the place to go” for “authentic” kosher South Indian “vegetarian treats”; the settings are “simple” and the service “inattentive”, but given the “lean prices” and “toothsome” fare, “who cares?” For more New York Top Lists, click here.

We're also saluting our “most dedicated” surveyor, Steven K., who has written 125 reviews a year for the past five years, and the biggest contributor to this year’s NYC Survey, Sulema E., who reviewed an impressive 223 restaurants. Each receives a $100 gift card, as do all the winners noted below. For more witty surveyor comments, check the Outtakes section of Zagat Buzz. Wittiest \"For emergency BBQ fix only. Use sparingly.

We’re always flattered when satirists find inspiration in our concise, quote-filled style – it’s even been translated into spoof reviews of life itself. And now it’s turned up in an analysis of last week's Biden-Palin debate. In The New Yorker's online edition, George Packer writes: \"The 'surprisingly wonky' Palin 'exceeded expectations,' though she 'relied heavily on talking points' and 'repeatedly failed to answer questions.' Viewers found her 'feisty,' 'cloying,' 'bemused,' and 'manic.'\" To read the whole piece, click here.

Per Se Photo: Courtesy of Per Se Despite these tough economic times, the über-pricey Per Se came in first for Top Food in the just-released 2009 New York City Restaurants guide, followed by Le Bernardin, Daniel (last year’s victor), Jean Georges and Sushi Yasuda. This is Per Se’s debut in the No. 1 slot after five years in the top three, and it also finished first in the Top Service category. There were upsets in the world of cheap eats too, with first-time winners – all from Brooklyn – in three hotly contested categories: Top Burger went to DuMont, Top Pizza to Lucali and Top BBQ to Fette Sau. To help cost-conscious diners, the new guide lists four pages of Best Buys, including bargain prix fixe meals at many of the city’s most revered restaurants, such as Jean Georges and Le Cirque. In addition, there are 648 restaurants reviewed at which dinner costs less than $30, and lunch is likely to come in under $20. The Survey also found that 38% of New Yorkers report eating out less in response to the economic downturn. But Tim Zagat remains optimistic about the future of the city’s dining: “Restaurants are clearly feeling the pinch from the economic crisis. But in the long run they will weather this storm, just as they did after 1987’s Black Monday and 2001’s 9/11. The culinary revolution that began two generations ago and the demographic changes underlying it are now part of our culture. While we foresee some hard times, New York is likely to remain the world’s leading restaurant city.”

After chef David Burke and restaurateur Donatella Arpaia split up last August, it seemed likely that the restaurant that shared the duo's names, davidburke & donatella, was probably not much longer for this world (at least by that name). So it comes as little surprise that, according to Burke's camp, the restaurant will become davidburke townhouse before the end of the year. Besides the new name, don't expect too many changes, though the chef says he might do some slight renovations. And that isn't the only news in the land of David Burke. The chef is also planning a fish house called Fishtail David Burke in the old Zoë Townhouse/Jovia space at 135 East 62nd Street. The restaurant will offer both high-end and simple takes on various sea-dwellers.

Rendering of Terrazza Toscana Restaurant renderings aren’t usually publicly displayed, because the finished product often ends up looking worlds apart from the planned design. Apparently, Terrazza Toscana, coming to Hell’s Kitchen, has no such concerns, as its plywooded corner has been plastered with multiple shots of design plans. We hope they can pull it off: another alfresco option (on the roof, at that) is always welcome, even if we'll have to wait until spring to take advantage of it (742 9th Ave.).

Kobe Club now offers a prix fixe dinner. Photo: Noah Kalina With the economy in question, restaurants are looking to prix fixe meals to entice diners along with added breakfast, brunch and lunch service. Most recently getting into the act are the Midtown steakhouse Kobe Club and the Upper East Side's still wet-behind-the-ears Italian Alloro. At Jeffrey Chodorow's samurai-friendly meatery diners can enjoy a three-course prix fixe dinner for $35 until Thanksgiving. Those who are feeling flush can try the two six-course tasting menus available for $95 with American beef and $165 with Japanese Kobe beef. Meanwhile, Alloro diners can indulge in a $45 four-course \"Back to School\" prix fixe dinner including an appetizer, a pasta course, an entree and dessert as well as a glass of wine and coffee or tea. For more prix fixe dinner options, check out our list of the Best Prix Fixe Dinners.

Breaking Bread With Its Preeminent Scholar

***CONTENT
Steven Kaplan in France, where he investigated collective bread poisoning for his latest book Photo: courtesy of Steven Kaplan Good bread can be hard to find. At least it is if you've got the lofty standards of leading bread historian Steven Laurence Kaplan, who reveals that he tends to BYOB (bring your own bread) even at fancy restaurants. Kaplan, a Cornell professor, has written Good Bread Is Back and, more recently, Le Pain Maudit (Cursed Bread), about a collective bread poisoning that occurred in a small town near Avignon. He recently spoke at Breadbar in LA, and the Buzz caught up with him to glean further crumbs of knowledge. The man sure knows his baguettes, but the wonder is he knows his Wonder Bread as well. ZB: The press release for your appearance at the Breadbar describes you as \"the world's leading expert on French bread\" and \"the world's preeminent bread scholar.\" Not to be too irreverent – but are there others contending for those titles? SK: Irreverence is an excellent posture for an interviewer. Let's call it skepticism, to be more elegant or neutral. I have worked with and on bread for 40 years. It is unlikely that there is anyone else on the planet – unless he or she lives in a cave or operates clandestinely – who has combined the practical experience in the bake-room with the infinite investment in archival research, who has articulated the practices of the artisan and the intellectual. Were you to query experts in France, I think they would concur with the Breadbar's ostensibly hyperbolic appreciation. ZB: Did you grow up eating Wonder Bread? SK: Yes, alas. Yuck. Powerful memories of the crystallization of a robust aversion. ZB: Is Wonder Bread properly bread? SK: To the extent that it incorporates flour, water, some salt and a fermenting agent, yes. To the extent that it combines all sorts of supplementary additives, technological auxiliaries, improvers, and myriad other chemicals, fortifiers, preservers, etc., and that it is manufactured in hyper-industrial conditions, to call it bread requires a magnanimous generosity of spirit. ZB: What drew you to bread? SK: On the sensual plane, the accident of an encounter in a Paris bakery the first day I set foot in Paris 45 years ago drew me to it. Intellectually, it was the search of a doctoral thesis \"problem\" or framing theme that touched on all aspects of the human experience from politics and social relations to economic growth and state construction; from religion and collective psychology to culture and agriculture, etc. The one nourished the other. The hedonic spurred the scholarly appetite. The two have operated in fruitful complement for many decades. I am convinced that truly exalting pleasure cannot be mindless. Even if one is not preoccupied with origins, influences and evolutions, bread must be good to think before it is good to eat, to paraphrase the great French anthropologist [Claude] Lévi-Strauss. ZB: Do you nibble on bread the way others might smoke a cigarette? SK: No. I respect bread too much to nibble on it mechanically or casually. Yet I cannot avoid tasting it and assessing it whenever I encounter it. When I buy a baguette, for example, if it is truly enthralling, I risk devouring half before I reach home. ZB: Is there a hidden aesthetic to bread? SK: Good bread is predicated on an aesthetic of rigor and truth that yields beauty and pleasure. It is anything but hidden. It is the mark or test of artisanal creation and realization. ZB: If a meal without wine is like a day without sunshine, what is a meal without bread? SK: A meal without bread is very much in the same idiomatic relation of necessity that your aphorism describes. It is more than a mere complement. It opens a whole organoleptic front. It enriches and delights. ZB: Which restaurants have the best breads? SK: You know, I have been spending much more time in France than in the U.S. over the past few years. Even in France, I often bring my own bread to fine restaurants. Restaurants there propose sumptuous dishes and engaging wine lists, but are often indifferent to or disdainful of bread. I take this as a personal affront. I try to shame them into obtaining better bread. Making bread is a separate craft from cooking, and is rarely done well by chefs – who are busy doing other things. Beyond Breadbar, in the USA, I have never tasted acceptable restaurant bread. ZB: Well, then, what are your favorite breads at LA's Breadbar? SK: My favorite Breadbar breads are the baguette (Tour de France), the canonic measure of excellence in classical baking, and the sumptuous Millstone (or Tourte). – Merrill Shindler

Paul Newman's Legacy

Legendary actor Paul Newman passed away over the weekend. Although best known as a movie star, he was also renowned as an entrepreneur/philanthropist thanks to his Newman’s Own brand of food products, which began as a line of salad dressing and grew to encompass everything from popcorn to lemonade to spaghetti sauce. All profits from this enterprise were donated to various charities, allowing him to harness his global fame for the common good. Not incidentally, he was also a racecar driver and even a restaurateur (Dressing Room in Westport, CT). Ultimately, his legacy lies in his movies. As a tribute to his wide-ranging body of work, here is a list of 20 notable Newman films, rated and reviewed by our voters. It is excerpted from the 2009 Zagat Movie Guide. Key to Zagat Ratings Absence of Malice 1981 | Directed by Sydney Pollack | With Paul Newman, Sally Field, Bob Balaban | 116 minutes | Rated PG Overall Acting Story Prod. 21 25 21 20 \"Newman and Field ignite the screen\" in this \"textured\" \"hard-hitting\" courtroom drama demonstrating how \"guilt by association\" causes a \"newspaper to ruin a man's career\"; most say that the \"irresponsible press\" is a topic made for the movies, but some feel this \"slight\" effort \"should have been better\" – starting with the \"not-believable ending.\" Butch Cassidy & the Sundance Kid 1969 | Directed by George Roy Hill | With Paul Newman, Robert Redford, Katharine Ross | 110 minutes | Rated PG Overall Acting Story Prod. 26 26 25 25 \"Compulsive charmers\" Newman and Redford play a pair of wisecracking, \"magnetic\" \"antiheroes\" trying to stay ahead of the law in this \"outstanding\" Western \"buddy movie\", loaded with \"adventure and humor\"; it fuses a \"snappy\" script, Burt Bacharach soundtrack and \"too many classic scenes to count\" into a \"sentimental favorite\" that's \"never boring\" from start to \"unforgettable\" finish. Cars 2006 | Directed by John Lasseter, Joe Ranft | Animated | 116 minutes | Rated G Overall Acting Story Prod. 24 - 23 27 Disney/Pixar's \"well-oiled\" animation outfit rigs a \"familiar fish-out-of- water story\" (\"Doc Hollywood\", anyone?) to \"talking cars\" and rolls out this \"delightful\" joyride featuring \"exceptional\" renderings and \"adorable\" vocal characterizations by Owen Wilson, Paul Newman and comic Larry The Cable Guy; parents appreciate the \"great\" soundtrack and \"offbeat\" cultural references – real lifesavers when the young 'uns \"watch it for the 30th time.\" Cat on a Hot Tin Roof 1958 | Directed by Richard Brooks | With Elizabeth Taylor, Paul Newman, Burl Ives | 108 minutes | Not Rated Overall Acting Story Prod. 25 27 24 23 \"Man, these people have problems\": \"steamy Liz\" \"in that white slip\" and a \"dynamite\" Newman \"couldn't possibly look better\" as they \"burn up the screen\" in this \"sex-soaked\" Tennessee Williams drama of \"love, rejection\" and \"Southern family politics\"; the \"towering\" Ives presides as the ragin' Big Daddy, adding an \"incredibly interesting\" Lear-like thread to all that \"eye candy.\" Color of Money, The 1986 | Directed by Martin Scorsese | With Paul Newman, Tom Cruise, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio | 119 minutes | Rated R Overall Acting Story Prod. 16 21 16 17 Something different from Martin Scorsese, this \"generation-later\" \"follow-up to The Hustler\" details how a washed-up billiards baron molds an up-and-comer into his protégé; though somewhat \"predictable\", \"excellent acting\" from the \"powerhouse Cruise\" and the \"finely tuned\", Oscar-winning Newman \"saves it.\" Cool Hand Luke 1967 | Directed by Stuart Rosenberg | With Paul Newman, George Kennedy, Strother Martin | 126 minutes | Not Rated Overall Acting Story Prod. 26 27 24 22 \"One of the best movie lines ever\" ('what we have here is a failure to communicate') and that \"famous hard-boiled egg scene\" make this \"damn great\" Deep South prison drama memorable – not to mention the efforts of \"consummate pro\" Newman playing one cool con on a \"chain gang\", abetted by a \"strong\" Kennedy, who grabbed an Oscar for his supporting work. Exodus 1960 | Directed by Otto Preminger | With Paul Newman, Eva Marie Saint, Sal Mineo | 210 minutes | Not Rated Overall Acting Story Prod. 23 23 26 25 An \"all-star cast\" drives this story of the \"founding of modern Israel\", a \"stunning\", \"satisfying\" Preminger epic \"faithfully\" adapted from Leon Uris' best-seller; fans single out the star turn from a \"too-gorgeous-for-words\" Newman \"in his prime\", and if the plot has some \"bathos\" mixed into its \"high drama\", it's ultimately a \"moving\" moving picture. Fort Apache, The Bronx 1981 | Directed by Daniel Petrie | With Paul Newman, Ken Wahl, Rachel Ticotin, Ed Asner | 125 minutes | Rated R Overall Acting Story Prod. 21 23 21 20 Considered \"shocking in its day\", this \"gritty\" snapshot of a \"city overtaken by crime\" set a \"new standard for cop dramas\" with its \"tell-it- like-it-is\" depiction of hookers, junkies and the NYPD; \"not-bad-on-the- eyes\" Newman is \"at his acting best\" as the veteran \"good guy\" on the force, with strong backup from a \"wonderful ensemble.\" Harper 1966 | Directed by Jack Smight | With Paul Newman, Lauren Bacall, Julie Harris, Arthur Hill, Janet Leigh, Pamela Tiffin, Robert Wagner, Shelley Winters | 121 minutes | Not Rated Overall Acting Story Prod. 21 23 20 21 Renowned for its all-star, scenery-shredding cast, this \"fun\" private dick flick features a \"vintage Paul\" hot on the trail of a missing husband; if the \"plot is entirely predictable\", \"none of the actors are\", with special kudos to an \"entertaining\" Bacall as a witchy wife and a \"classic\" Winters as a blousy, boozy starlet. Hud 1963 | Directed by Martin Ritt | With Paul Newman, Melvyn Douglas, Patricia Neal, Brandon De Wilde | 112 minutes | Not Rated Overall Acting Story Prod. 26 28 24 24 \"Stud muffin\" Newman is at his \"bad boy best\" playing an \"alienated\", \"black-hearted\" cowboy in this \"truly adult\" \"modern Western\" about a \"struggle between a father and son\"; sure, \"Neal got the Oscar\" (as did \"heartbreaker Douglas\" and that \"gorgeous black-and-white cinematography\"), but in the end, Paul's \"heartbreakingly cool\" anti-hero gets the most reaction. Hudsucker Proxy, The 1994 | Directed by Joel Coen | With Tim Robbins, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Paul Newman | 111 minutes | Rated PG Overall Acting Story Prod. 22 22 21 23 \"Big business\" and the \"bootstrappy American dream\" are satirized in this \"sly satire\" via the Coen brothers about a \"plucky mailroom clerk\" who \"invents the hula hoop\" (\"ya know, for kids\") and becomes president of the company; despite a \"refreshingly cynical\" script peppered with \"dialogue so crisp you can hear the gum smacking\", a few find it a bit \"odd\", though it's certainly \"never dull.\" Hustler, The 1961 | Directed by Robert Rossen | With Paul Newman, Jackie Gleason, Piper Laurie | 134 minutes | Not Rated Overall Acting Story Prod. 25 26 24 22 \"Dark, tense and beautifully delivered\", this \"ultimate movie about winning\" is also a \"love poem to the game of pool\", featuring \"Newman on a roll\" opposite Gleason in a rare dramatic turn that nearly \"steals the picture\"; it's \"convincing\", \"gripping\" stuff, and though Paul reprised the character of Eddie Felson in The Color of Money, connoisseurs claim this first take is so \"much better.\" Road to Perdition 2002 | Directed by Sam Mendes | With Tom Hanks, Paul Newman, Daniel Craig, Jude Law | 117 minutes | Rated R Overall Acting Story Prod. 23 26 22 25 \"Hanks proves his versatility\" in this \"evocative period piece\", playing a \"cold-blooded hit man\" for the Irish mafia during the Depression; the \"intense journey\" is \"impeccably done\", with Newman in \"stellar form\", Oscar-winning cinematography that will \"take your breath away\" (notably that \"tommy gun scene in the rain\") and \"top-notch screenwriting\" that \"stays true to the novel.\" Silent Movie 1976 | Directed by Mel Brooks | With Mel Brooks, Marty Feldman, Dom DeLuise, Sid Caesar | 87 minutes | Rated PG Overall Acting Story Prod. 20 20 19 20 \"Kudos\" to Brooks for ditching dialogue and scoring \"audience roars\" with \"clever\" sight gags in this \"entertaining\" send-up of silent films; expect a parade of \"star\" cameos (Burt Reynolds, Liza Minnelli, Paul Newman), though the \"best moment\" belongs to mime Marcel Marceau, who utters the picture's \"only spoken word.\" Slap Shot 1977 | Directed by George Roy Hill | With Paul Newman, Michael Ontkean, Strother Martin | 122 minutes | Rated R Overall Acting Story Prod. 22 18 19 17 Right up there with the \"funniest sports flicks\", this puckish comedy finds \"Newman on skates\" as the \"foul-mouthed coach\" of a \"dark horse\" minor-league hockey team with a \"strange way\" of turning every face-off into a riot on ice; it \"epitomizes the goonery\" of the high-sticking '70s, resulting in \"crazy\", \"profane\" and \"fairly violent\" fare that hardcore fans \"cannot live without.\" Sting, The 1973 | Directed by George Roy Hill | With Paul Newman, Robert Redford, Robert Shaw | 129 minutes | Rated PG Overall Acting Story Prod. 27 26 27 26 \"Deftly\" charming its way to Best Picture honors, this \"classy\" comedy \"caper\" \"succeeds in spades\" as a \"likable\", \"fast-paced\" vehicle for Newman and Redford, radiating \"great rapport\" as a pair of grifters playing a gangster for a sucker in Depression-era Chicago; a \"funny, intriguing\" \"period piece\" set to \"elegant\" Joplin rags, it raises the \"suspense\" stakes with \"masterful\" plotting and a final \"zinger\" that saves the sharpest sting for last. Sweet Bird of Youth 1962 | Directed by Richard Brooks | With Paul Newman, Geraldine Page, Ed Begley, Shirley Knight | 120 minutes | Not Rated Overall Acting Story Prod. 24 28 24 23 A \"young, gorgeous\" Newman and \"brilliant\" Page (\"what a combo!\") reprise their stage roles in this cinematic adaptation of Tennessee Williams' play about a wannabe actor/gigolo and a faded, Sunset Boulevard–esque movie queen; sure, the story has been somewhat sanitized for the big screen, but most birdies still tweet \"how sweet it is . . .\" Torn Curtain 1966 | Directed by Alfred Hitchcock | With Paul Newman, Julie Andrews, Lila Kedrova, Wolfgang Kieling | 128 minutes | Rated PG Overall Acting Story Prod. 23 24 23 22 This \"compelling\" Cold War spy thriller via Alfred Hitchcock concerns an American physicist who defects to East Germany, bent on espionage; while it \"isn't the greatest Newman or Andrews\" effort, it still \"has is moments\", notably the 'silent murder' sequence and Lila Kedrova's \"compelling\" supporting role as a down-and-out countess. Towering Inferno, The 1974 | Directed by John Guillermin, Irwin Allen | With Steve McQueen, Paul Newman, William Holden | 165 minutes | Rated PG Overall Acting Story Prod. 18 17 18 22 \"Make sure you know where all the exits are\" before settling into this \"big, bad '70s disaster\" flick starring a skyscraper, a fire and a \"rogues' gallery of great actors\"; although the \"passable\" \"special effects were top-drawer for its time\", cynical sorts snort it's more of a \"made-for- TV movie\" by modern standards. Verdict, The 1982 | Directed by Sidney Lumet | With Paul Newman, Charlotte Rampling, Jack Warden | 129 minutes | Rated R Overall Acting Story Prod. 23 25 23 20 A \"David-vs.-Goliath\" legal struggle is the underpinning of this \"underrated\" courtroom drama about a \"burned-out lawyer trying one last case to keep from going under\"; Newman's \"intense\", \"tour-de-force\" turn is one of his \"greatest\" roles (leaving many \"stunned\" that the Oscar eluded him), while the \"mesmerizing\" Rampling \"excels\" as the love interest.

Where to Eat After Going to MAD

The new Museum of Arts and Design photo: Hélène Binet After one of the more vocal preservation fights in recent New York memory (even Tom Wolfe got in on it), the new home of the Museum of Arts and Design (née the American Craft Museum) will open on the southern tip of Columbus Circle tomorrow – and it's free to the public all weekend (10 AM–6 PM). Whether you like architect Brad Cloepfil's take on the famed \"lollipop building\" or not, MAD's new home with spectacular views of Central Park is worth a visit. It's got more than twice the exhibition space than before plus a new Tiffany-sponsored gallery for contemporary jewelry. But after seeing all of that craft, where to eat? After the jump, we pick a few nearby spots to pair with your museum-going (Wednesday and Friday–Sunday 11 AM–6 PM, Thursday 11 AM–9 PM; $15 per adult; $12 per student/senior; children age 12 and under are free; 2 Columbus Circle; 212-299-7777). A Longer Lunch Blue Ribbon Sushi Bar & Grill 308 W. 58th St.; 212-397-0404 The latest from the Blue Ribbon team provides a serene, woodsy setting to contemplate the art you've just seen, and its Japanese fare stands up well to its sibling's reputations. Hudson Cafeteria 356 W. 58th St.; 212-554-6000 Though it's no longer the epicenter of hip, the Hudson Hotel's restaurant still offers a stylish spot to sit back and think about MAD's exhibits. Its outdoor area is especially welcome on a warm day. Landmarc 10 Columbus Circle, 3rd fl.; 212-823-6123 Kids get free cotton candy for dessert at Marc Murphy's New American bistro at the Time Warner Center. Its wine list, rated one of the best in the city, makes it a fun choice for grown-ups too. Jean Georges 1 Central Park W. ; 212-299-3900 One of the top restaurants in the city, Jean-Georges Vongerichten’s flagship is also home to one of the best deals in the city: a three-course prix fixe lunch in the Nougatine Room for only $24 (available Monday–Saturday). A Faster Lunch Bouchon Bakery 10 Columbus Circle, 3rd fl.; 212-823-9366 Though on the pricey side, Thomas Keller's cafe/patisserie offers a variety of high-end sandwiches and salads with a take-out area for those really in a hurry. And, there are few better views of the new MAD building than from the windowed front of the Time Warner Center. Whole Foods Cafe 10 Columbus Circle, downstairs; 212-823-9600 Yes, it's a food court/salad bar in a grocery store. But the quality and scope of its selections (from sushi to gazpacho and back again) makes it a no-brainer when your party can't agree on a cuisine. AQ Kafe 1800 Broadway; 718-784-7364 Expected to open any day now, this outpost of Marcus Samuelsson's AQ Cafe promises to bring a smörgåsbord of Scandinavian goodies to Columbus Circle for reasonable prices. UPDATE 10/1/08: AQ Kafe has opened.

Oktoberfest is returning to the Shake Shack. Photo: Noah Kalina Oktoberfest, that annual Bavarian celebration of drinking and sausages, has already started in Munich, where it runs until the first Sunday in October, which this year falls on the fifth. But its charms will be available here in New York for even longer as Shake Shack in Madison Square Park will be hosting its Shaktoberfest celebration from October 3rd–17th. The details of the Shack's special menu are still being hashed out, but so far it includes pumpkin custard, German chocolate \"concretes\" and various special sausages and bratwursts. Of course, you don't have to wait until October 3rd to get in touch with your inner German. TriBeCa's Blaue Gans is offering a completely different menu from now until the end of the celebrations in Munich; specials include a wurtz platter ($10) and apple fritters ($10). Also through the fifth, the Upper East Side's Heidelberg is celebrating with live German music on Wednesdays, Fridays and Saturdays as well as with special beers and an Oktoberfest menu. And on Staten Island, Killmeyer's Old Bavaria Inn is offering an Oktoberfest beer menu, along with live music Saturday and Sunday afternoons and Friday and Saturday night in its biergarten. Ja!

***CONTENT
New York's latest fast-food chain? Empanada Joe's. As its name implies the counter-serve spot, which opened its first branch at 2857 Broadway, focuses on the classic Latin American snacks, offering them in a variety of styles ranging from bacon, egg and cheese to one with caprese salad ($3.38 each) – there are even dessert renditions. If you haven't seen the chain yet, you probably will soon, as Joe's seems intent on expanding rapidly. The second branch is opening this week at 683 Eighth Avenue (by 43rd Street) and a third is in the works for 668 Sixth Avenue (between 21st and 22nd Streets). At a rate like this, could empanadas be the new fro-yo?

Lovers of sake, rejoice. The Joy of Sake, that annual festival celebrating the increasingly popular beverage, is coming back for its fifth year in New York at the end of the month. It's going to be bigger than ever with 327 different sakes available ranging in styles from junmai to daiginjo – if that means nothing to you, brush up on your terminology with our sake glossary. And of course it won't just be sake, sake, sake; once again the event will also feature food the likes of WD-50, Nobu and Sakagura. And with so much to taste, this year the event is moving out of its old digs in the Puck Building to the larger venue available at Webster Hall (September 25, 6–9 PM; $80 per person in advance; $90 at the door if available; 125 East 11th St.; to purchase tickets call 888-799-7242 or visit www.joyofsake.com).

Bar Q is adding lunch Thursday through Sunday. Photo: Ryan Charles With the financial markets in disarray, restaurateurs are looking for ways to keep their tables turning. And one of the quickest ways to do that, it seems, is to increase their operating hours and offer more meals. To that end, in its attempt to become a 24-hour eatery, newcomer Delicatessen has commenced serving breakfast, starting daily at 7:30 AM. In about three weeks, the restaurant hopes to be open around the clock, at which point it will begin offering delivery service as well. Also adding breakfast service is Chelsea's Cookshop, which will offer its take on the morning meal Monday–Friday from 8–11 AM starting on Thursday. On the Upper West Side, the New American Dovetail has added a brunch on Sundays only (for now) from 11:30 AM–2:30 PM. Also getting into the brunch business is Neil Ferguson's LES hot spot Allen & Delancey, which is set to debut a brunch this weekend from 10:30 AM–2 PM; no reservations. Meanwhile – presumably because an Asian barbecue brunch is a hard sell – Anita Lo's gleaming newcomer in the West Village Bar Q has added a weekend lunch service from Thursday–Sunday 11:30 AM–2:30 PM. Adding meals isn't just for the newcomers. The Four Seasons is getting in on the action too – New York Magazine reports that the restaurant will begin serving breakfast this January.

Fall Restaurant Preview 2008

***CONTENT
As we've said, we're eager to see David Bouley transform his stretch of TriBeCa by shuffling around Bouley and Bouley, Upstairs and opening Secession and Brush Stroke. But those aren't the only debuts we're eagerly anticipating this fall – there's a slew of new openings all over the city. Several have been in the works for months, but unlike some that we looked at earlier, these (we hope!) are actually going to open – and soon. Almond: Now that Borough Food & Drink is closing, Jeffrey Chodorow is seeing if Bridgehampton's popular French bistro Almond can break the curse of this Flatiron space (Rocco's, Caviar & Bananas). Co-owner Eric Lemonides is tweaking the menu for its Manhattan debut, but plans to keep the signature roast chicken dish and mussels preparations; look for a late-October opening and wallpaper similar to the Hamptons original's (12 E. 22nd St.). Bar Bao: Michael \"Bao\" Huynh (ex Bún and Mai House) heads uptown and transforms the erstwhile Pan-Asian staple Rain into a Vietnamese restaurant and lounge. The interior has been completely gutted; expect to see whitewashed brick walls, wood paneling and violet upholsted banquettes when it opens on October 6th (100 W. 82nd St.). Bar Breton: In mid-October, Cyril Renaud is opening this brasserie not too far from his prix fixer, Fleur de Sel; he'll be serving authentic dishes like Brittany-style galettes, aka savory buckwheat crêpes (254 Fifth Ave.; 212-213-4999). Braeburn: Originally slated for July/August, this elegant West Village New American is now aiming for October; this will mark chef Brian Bistrong's (The Harrison, Bouley, Lespinasse) transition to chef-owner (117 Perry St.). Brasserie Athénée: The Theater District will get another French option when this brasserie opens next month in Kyma's old space (300 W. 46th St.; 212-957-8830). Buttermilk Channel: Named after the waterway that separates Brooklyn from Governors Island, this Carroll Gardens comfort-fooder from Doug Crowell (former GM of Blue Water Grill) and Ryan Angulo (ex Stanton Social) will feature local beers and an all-American wine list (524 Court St., Brooklyn). Co.: This artisanal, Naples-style pizzeria from Jim Lahey, who owns Sullivan Street Bakery, and partners Jean-Georges Vongerichten and Phil Suarez was due to open yesterday but it's been delayed until the end of October (230 Ninth Ave.). Corton: It's been over two years since Montrachet's soft closing, and its TriBeCa home is still trying to get back on the scene. Drew Nieporent says his latest should start serving its modern French cuisine from chef Paul Liebrandt (ex Gilt) by the end of the month if all goes according to plan. (He had been hoping to open the doors right after Labor Day.) The prix fixe–only restaurant will offer a tasting menu ($110) and a three-course prix fixe ($76) under the vaulted ceilings of its 65-seat dining room (239 West Broadway; 212-219-2777). Dirt Candy: Amanda Cohen (ex Pure Food and Wine) strikes out on her own next month with this casual, veggie-focused East Villager; expect dishes like carrot risotto with carrot dumplings and Parmesan curls (430 E. Ninth St.). Houndstooth: In October, the Garment District will get another gastropub – a sprawling, tri-level venture courtesy of Stitch on the same block (520 Eighth Ave.; 212-643-0014). John Dory: The crew behind Spotted Pig is looking for another smash hit when this British seafooder opens in November/December next to Del Posto, with Mario Batali and Joe Bastianich as backers along with April Bloomfield and Ken Friedman, of course; Esca sous-chef Sara Ochs will run the kitchen (85 10th Ave.). La Otra: Both branches of the Tasting Room may be gone, but chef Colin Alevras is not forgotten – not when he has this rustic-style Cuban opening by the end of the month (95 Ave. A; 212-260-6660). Not enough Alevras for you? Permanent Brunch, serving – you guessed it – brunch all day long, is also opening soon with an artisanal bacon bar (95 First Ave.; 212-533-3511). Minetta Tavern: Keith McNally will be reopening this Greenwich Village landmark as a French brasserie in December. He's redoing the plumbing and the kitchen, but the decor (including the murals) will be preserved (113 MacDougal St.; 212-475-3850). Oak Room: While the Palm Court reopened in March, the Plaza's makeover won't be complete until the 101-year-old Oak Room is open again. Set to reemerge on the scene in late-September after a two-year hiatus, it's enjoyed quite a storied history: the most notable alteration came when the actual bar itself was removed following the enactment of Prohibition in the 1920s. It reopened as a restaurant in 1934, again open to men only at lunchtime, with women allowed in at the dinner hour. This policy finally came to an end in 1969, when feminist Betty Friedan led a protest there that eventually led to it being open to both men and women at all hours. While it's always been expensive, throughout the years the food has played second fiddle to decor – this might change since its latest incarnation will be helmed by Joël Antunès (ex Joël), a renowned chef from Atlanta (768 Fifth Ave.; 212-759-3000). Pranna: Long Island restaurateurs Payal and Rajiv Sharma (Huntingdon's Sitar, Jericho's 1789 Restaurant at the Maine Maid Inn) will try their luck in the big city this October with a Pan-Asian venture incorporating the cuisines of Thailand, Laos, Cambodia and India. Set in the spacious Madison Park venue that last held Scopa (and has been vacant for two years), this newcomer's name means \"breath of life\" (79 Madison Ave.). Rouge Tomate: Its ripening on schedule and remains on track for its late-October opening in the old Nicole Farhi space. Even though it shares the same name as its Belgian parent, it certainly won't be a clone; expect New American cuisine with an emphasis on seasonal and sustainable ingredients (10 E. 60th St.). Shang: New Yorkers looking to get a taste of Susur Lee's Asian fusion cuisine will be saved the trip to Toronto come October. Although it won't be a replica of Lee, which ranks in Toronto's Top Food and Most Popular Lists, we're crossing our fingers that the chef's north-of-the-border debut in the new Thompson LES hotel will be just as good (190 Allen St.). And finally, Prospect Heights is getting a not-yet-named European-style cafe next month from Sarah Peck, who has held managerial positions at Schiller's, Lucky Strike and Pastis. In addition to the usual wine and beer, the bar will serve homemade kombucha, a tea like drink thought to have health benefits (622 Washington Ave., Brooklyn). – Liz Borod Wright

Miller At midpriced UWS newcomer Bloomingdale Road (named after Broadway’s original moniker), comfort food gets an innovative twist and a Southern slant à la ex-Varietal chef Ed Witt (think chicken ‘lollipops’ with a hot-sauce center, served with blue-cheese dip); set in the former bi-level Aix space, it has doubled the size of its predecessor’s bar and aims to lure those looking for something more sophisticated than the Amsterdam pub crawl. 2398 Broadway; 212-874-7400 See More Details Discover More New Restaurants Around New York

Daniel Boulud Photo: Courtesy of Daniel What do you do when you want something new but can’t let go of the old? Just pile it on! Hey, it worked for the Hearst Tower – and it works for Daniel too. The celebrated namesake of estimable chef Daniel Boulud reopened on September 8th after a five-week revamp conceived by restaurant-and-hotel design deity Adam Tihany on the occasion of the eatery’s 10th anniversary in its current home. And guess what? The second verse is nearly the same as the first in structure, but different in feel. Rather than mess with the space’s breathtaking neo-classical features, Tihany smartly left them as is, instead stacking them with gorgeous modern flourishes. While the majestic arches remain unscathed, their heavy draperies have been jettisoned for translucent, silvery-gray Roman shades. The ornate balustrades are still on view, only now beneath lighted etched-glass panels. The pilasters sprout sconces shaped like tree branches. From the tall, coffered ceilings hang Olympic-sized hoop chandeliers ringed with dot-speckled Limoges porcelain tiles, a domino effect repeated on the new Bernardaud china and menu covers. The melding of antique and modish succeeds mainly because the whole shebang is rendered almost entirely in neutral tones (shocks of bold color come via oxblood-red-leather and steel-blue furnishings in the dining room and lounge, respectively). Reinforcing the theme are works by Spanish artist Manolo Valdés, whose contemporary paintings and sculpture are layered with references to great artists of yore. How’s that for a perfect pairing? – Bill Corsello

Michael Ruhlman moderating conversation between Marco Pierre White and Anthony Bourdain Photo: Michael Harlan Turkell \"Great cooks teach themselves,\" Marco Pierre White told his fellow chefs at this year's Starchefs.com's 3rd Annual International Chefs Congress, which began yesterday at the Park Avenue Armory. Well, apparently the nearly 2,000 industry professionals attending the three-day event don't agree, as they have eagerly signed up for hands-on workshops, cooking demonstrations and lectures taught by more than 60 top chefs like Marcus Samuelsson (Aquavit), Wylie Dufresne (wd-50) and Traci Des Jardins (SF's Jardinière). Paul Liebrandt teaching sous vide techniques The symposium kicked off with Heston Blumenthal's (The Fat Duck in London) moving keynote address on the multisensory inspirations behind his dishes, and was followed with lectures like Charlie Trotter's discussion on community involvement and culinary innovation that played on the overall theme of \"The Responsibility of a Chef.\" Workshops on seasoning cocktails with bitters by Toby Maloney (Chicago's The Violet Hour) and new kitchen technology by Nils Noren and David Arnold of the French Culinary Institute were well attended. But with the increasing popularity of sous vide, it came as no surprise that Paul Liebrandt's (ex Gilt) class \"Voulez-vous Sous Vide Avec Moi (Ce Soir)?,\" or alternatively, \"Practices the Health Department May Frown On,\" had to turn people away at the door. In between lectures and seminars, participants perused the products fair, which held few surprises except for such sweet fare as chocolate-flavored cheese and chocolates filled with freeze-dried raspberries, passion fruit and Pop Rocks. The day culminated with an insightful and entertaining discussion between Anthony Bourdain and Marco Pierre White, moderated by author Michael Ruhlman. Both were frank about their likes and dislikes as they spoke about a celebrity chef's role in the kitchen and upcoming trends. White did not hide his disdain for chefs abandoning their highly rated establishments and leaving others to run them, calling Alain Ducasse's restaurants \"soulless\" without him. Bourdain, on the other hand, was more understanding that big-name chefs who own multiple restaurants can't always be present and maintained that it's a \"cruel and snobbish notion to expect Keller, 'St. Thomas of Napa', to die behind the stove.\" As for trends, Bourdain hopes that American chefs begin embracing skin and cartilage. White would like to see tasting menus disappear because they allow chefs to \"control their clients by forcing these 12- to 14-course menus down their throats.\" When he recalled one of his dining nightmares, a meal that lasted three-and-a-half hours and had too many courses to remember (with the chef slipping in extra courses), the audience not only laughed, but some even applauded. Though White says he cannot actually teach but \"just inspire,\" the chefs in the audience at least learned one thing: when Marco Pierre White enters their dining room, hide the tasting menus. Two courses will do him just fine and he'll pick them himself, thank you very much. – Jacqueline Wasilczyk

Do you think high-fructose corn syrup has received a bad rap? Let us know on the Zagat Discussion boards! Fans of The Omnivore’s Dilemma may want to sit down for this one. A new series of TV ads, brought to you by the Corn Refiners Association of America, informs viewers that high-fructose corn syrup has been unfairly slandered in regards to its obesity-inducing effects. Our favorite? The one where one mom accuses another of “not caring what her kids eat” as she pours a big glass of corn-syrup-laden punch, and then gets straightened out by “a sweet surprise” that “like sugar, it’s fine in moderation.” The commercial's affiliated website sweetsurprise.com points out that high-fructose corn syrup has the same number of calories as table sugar, and points out: “The U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted high fructose corn syrup ‘Generally Recognized as Safe’ status for use in food, and reaffirmed that ruling in 1996 after thorough review.” Oh, well in that case make ours super-sized!

The Bouley Shuffle Continues

1. Bouley's future location; 2. Bouley's current location and future home of Bouley Market; 3. Current location of Bouley Bakery and Bouley, Upstairs; 4. future home of Secession in Danube's former space; 5. future location of Brush Stroke. If there is one chef to watch in the 2008/09 season it would have to be David Bouley. The TriBeCa toque is in the midst of a massive shuffle in his campus of restaurants around Duane Street – an area we like to think of as Bouleyville. Though we reported most of these changes last February, the enormous amount of work involved has meant inevitable delays, and since the Buzz took a recent walk-through of the construction we thought a refresher was in order as the openings approach. Because of an embargo, we can't tell you about the remarkably detailed decor we saw – from the hand-carved wood floors to the hand-painted wallpaper – but trust us when we say it's in a league of its own. So, try to follow along as this will be on the final exam: at some point by the end of the month, Bouley's eponymous flagship will quietly move down the block from its current digs into an exquisitely detailed new space in the Mohawk building at 163 Duane Street. Once it is settled, the Bouley Bakery will move across Duane into the old Bouley space (120 West Broadway), which will be redone and rechristened as the Bouley Market. Then Bouley, Upstairs will expand into the bakery's old space just below (130 West Broadway). While all of that is happening the indefatigable chef will also be opening a new French, Italian and Mediterranean brasserie called Secession in the old Danube space (30 Hudson St.; 212-791-3771). Oh, and Bouley is also working on a \"commissary\" concept at 10 Hudson Square that will not only serve food but also provide space for the bakery's cooking operations. Still not enough Bouley for you? That's fine, because he's also working on one more addition to Bouleyville: Brush Stroke, a tri-level Japanese restaurant co-sponsored by the Tsuji Culinary Academy that is going into the old Delphi space at 109 West Broadway. We just hope he's got a nap scheduled in there somewhere.

By Garth Johnston, ZAGAT.com Staff Writer The risks of opening new branches can outweigh the rewards. Southern Hospitality is reportedly thinking of opening a second location. photo: Emily Capo As the onset of fall restaurant openings approaches, we find ourselves again lost in memories of those that are no longer with us. Previously we looked at restaurants that, despite oodles of press, never opened their doors. Just as disheartening are those that opened just fine and then expanded beyond their reach. Once a restaurant concept has been proven, the urge to expand can be tremendous – not the least because bulk ordering can lower overhead. But while many a restaurateur would love to have a chain of successes glittering around the world (or just up and down the fair isle of Manhattan), it doesn’t always work out. Not every restaurant can be parlayed into a BLT, Blue Ribbon, Momofuku or Dos Caminos. In honor of the fallen, come with us on a graveyard tour of those whose siblings just couldn’t cut it – and that in some cases proved to be the egg that killed the goose. The most recent example is the East Village small-plates hot spot the Tasting Room. After opening in 1999 to acclaim (and a 27 Food rating from Zagat surveyors), the Room team opened a second, larger location on Elizabeth Street in 2006. Unfortunately, that new branch couldn't seem to pull its weight and closed this June, followed promptly by the original. On the plus side, Eater reports that chef Colin Alevras will be back at the stove in the Village soon enough. The Tasting Room isn't the only restaurant to have followed such a trajectory. In October 2003, Mandler's, a German meats and sandwich shop, opened to much fanfare on East 17th Street. Brisk business led to a second outpost on Eighth Avenue and 40th Street in April 2007. But lightning didn't strike twice and the second shop was gone in six months. Then, six months later in April 2008, the original Mandler's said a hearty auf Wiedersehen. The East Village Venezuelan Flor's Kitchen opened in 1998 on First Avenue and quickly found a niche for itself with local diners. In January 2004, it expanded into the West Village with a second location on Waverly Place. But the strain of two locations must have added up. The original closed in 2007, followed a year later by its offspring. A similar fate hit Louisiana import Jacques-Imo's. The Cajun restaurant set up shop across from the Natural History Museum in February 2004 and then opened a second spot in Grand Central less than a year later. But after two years the Grand Central location closed, followed a year later by the Upper West Side site. (Meanwhile, the New Orleans original is doing just fine and is one of the most popular in our Survey there.) Giorgione photo: Noah Kalina Of course, a failed spin-off doesn't necessarily mean the death of the original (the failure of Model's Inc. didn't hurt Melrose Place). Plenty of restaurants do just fine after closing a stumbling second shot. Take Giorgione for example. The SoHo Italian opened in 2002, spun off Giorgione 508 at the end of 2005 and then closed it this past July. Stage Deli, the Seventh Avenue standard since 1937, opened an Upper East Side outpost in 2002 and closed it in 2004. National steak chain Ruth's Chris came to New York in 1993 and opened a second branch 10 years later only to close the second in less than two years. And Murray Hill's Sushi Sen-nin survived too. It debuted in 1998 and opened a second outpost on the Upper East Side in 2004 – then the original moved one block in 2006 and is still open while the sequel closed this past March. Sometimes it takes a few locations before a restaurateur has to pull back. The Indian mini-chain Cafe Spice started off on University Place in 1998 and added a second location in Grand Central in 2000. It met its match, however, when a more elaborate version opened in 2004 on West 55th Street. That location lasted four years before folding. Similarly SoHo Pan-Asian Kelley & Ping debuted to accolades in 1993 and parlayed that success into a big push a decade later, opening a Murray Hill location in 2004 and another on the Bowery in 2005. The Murray Hill spot closed in 2006 and the Bowery locale closed in 2007 – just as the Bowery began its recent revitalization in earnest. And then there are the cases where a spin-off isn't exactly what it seems. West Village New American The Place opened in 1998 in a romantic space on West Fourth Street. Then in 2005, during a classic landlord dispute, the restaurant, fearing eviction, decided to open a second location on West 10th Street that November. Once the landlord dispute had been settled and the original's lease had been extended, the sequel was shuttered in July 2007. The original has hummed along since. Dispite the cautionary tales noted above, there will never be a shortage of eateries thinking of cloning themselves – we're looking at you Southern Hospitality – and plenty do succeed. But sometimes it might be that the best thing a successful restaurant can do is keep its current customers happy. – With help from Larry Cohn

***CONTENT
Tickets are still available for a dinner with Alain Ducasse at Adour. Tickets for the first annual New York City Wine & Food Festival went on sale in June and, unsurprisingly, sales for the October 9th–12th event have been brisk. Although many events have already sold out, the Grand Tastings still have tickets left (October 11 and 12, 11 AM–2 PM and 3–6 PM; $150 per person). Also some top-dollar items, like a dinner with Alain Ducasse at Adour (October 11, 7 PM; $750 per person), are very much available. Another event with tickets is an afternoon with el Bulli's Ferran Adrià and his former apprentice José Andrés (Washington DC's Zaytinya); the cost includes copies of both chef's recent books as well as access to that day's Grand Tasting (October 12, 3–8 PM; $275 per person). A less expensive way to enjoy the fest is to attend the sake tasting at Ono (October 11, 2–4 PM; $35 per person). If you are planning on stopping by the festival, you might want to buy your tickets soon before they're all gone.

Hea photo: Moira Campbell The name of East Village newcomer Hea (pronounced “hee”), which opens next Monday, is Cantonese slang for “chill out.” And the bi-level space of this South Asian–Japanese arrival sounds designed for just that, with a lounge downstairs (open until 2 AM Thursday–Saturday) and a more formal dining room with a sushi bar upstairs. In a bid for decor-hook-of-the-week, the restaurant also apparently boasts a 300-year-old calligraphy table (145 E. 13th St.; 212-982-1688).

Pacific Standard was standing room only for Obama's acceptance speech. photo: Woody Loverude Where do you go to watch major events? Let us know on the Zagat Discussion boards! Last night, the mood felt a little different around 10 PM last night at some New York City bars and restaurants. It seems that many New Yorkers decided that they didn't want to be home alone watching the historic moment of Barack Obama accepting his party's nomination, and instead headed to their neighborhood establishments. At the East Village newcomer The Redhead, two mute TVs followed the convention throughout dinner until Obama approached the podium, at which point the volume was turned up and the restaurant came to a standstill for the duration of the speech. Even the kitchen staff came out to watch. And over in Brooklyn, folks were just as fascinated. Park Slope brewpub Pacific Standard was so filled with drinkers seeking to watch the speech in good company that it eventually had to turn people away at the door. As the speech continued, the bar eventually ran out of glasses. Did you go out to watch the speech? Where did you go?

Remember how less than one month after Sheridan Square opened, it took over the space next door, the former wine bar Tasca? Remember how it was supposed to be turned into a private dining room by July? Yeah, scratch that. Per KBHall, the space is now scheduled to reopen in September as a wine-and-tapas bar called Tierra. Franklin Becker will be providing the Mediterranean fare while still cooking next door, and Sterling Roig will be running the wine elements in this West Village 40-seater (130 Seventh Ave.).

Kurve photo: Ryan Charles After much schadenfreude online, Kurve has landed its ultramodern neon spaceship in the East Village. Andy Yang's (Rhong Tiam) pink Pan Asian started letting the general public in this past weekend and the Buzz stopped by for a drink at the curved bar. Our favorite detail in the quirky-to-a-fault decor from designer Karim Rashid is probably the bathrooms – complete with frosted green glass walls – that are stuffed behind the DJ booth. It's good thing we didn't put Kurve in our Dude, Where's My Restaurant? story (87 2nd Avenue; 212-260-8018).

photo: korafotomorgana From bankers to hipsters, anything Philly can do New York can do better, right? Some serious New York beer connoisseurs could not bear the fact that the City of Brotherly Love hosts an annual Craft Beer Festival while the city that never sleeps had nothing of the kind. To remedy the situation, for the first time ever New York City will be hosting its own Craft Beer Week across the city from September 12th–21st. Take that, Philly! The week actually kicks off with a separate but affiliated beer event, the third annual New York Brewfest on the South Street Seaport's Piers 16 and 17. A beer sampler's paradise, the Brewfest boasts over 300 styles of handcrafted beers for drinkers to sip while they listen to four different bands (September 12, 5–10 PM; $50 per person). Then the week of beer-pairing dinners (Good Fork, Heartland Brewery, Paloma, etc.) and bar crawls all over Manhattan and Brooklyn get underway. Ranging in cost from $13–$22 per person, each crawl includes a beer at every bar and a complimentary Craft Beer Week mug. Closing out the week is the second annual Cask Ale Festival at the Chelsea Brewing Co. from September 19th–21st, where visitors will be able to partake in eight- or 16-oz. glasses of over 45 different cask ales from breweries around the nation. There is no entry fee, and it's promised that prices will be \"reasonable.\" (Click here for a full PDF guide to Craft Beer Week.)

Dude, Where's My Restaurant?

***CONTENT
By Garth Johnston, ZAGAT.com Staff Writer Remember that hot new restaurant that was supposed to open last year? Yeah, we're still waiting too. In the August doldrums, it's easy for the hungry mind to wander from the Olympics toward the promises of the upcoming fall restaurant openings. As we focus on the Next Big Thing, we often forget about the hyped restaurants of seasons past that still haven't opened yet, that never materialized after all the buzz about how cool they were going to be. Now, we'll be the first to admit that launching a restaurant is tough – you need a chef, a concept, a space, a staff and the money to put them all together, not to mention a tremendous amount of time to sort through all of the paperwork. Anytime a restaurant gives an opening date that isn't today (ok, or this week), we take it with a grain of salt. But even with a cup of salt, the distance from a restaurant's announcement to its actual opening can still manage to stretch forever (we're looking at you, 10 Downing). With that in mind, let's look at two specific kinds of nonexistent restaurants: the big pushes that missed the pool and the ones that got lost in the move. How to Make Millions Disappear The discussion of failed restaurants that never were has to begin with Magic Underground. The grand poohbah of stillborn restaurants, Underground was to be an epic magic-themed restaurant in Times Square with magician David Copperfield as its public face, the late Joe Baum (Windows on the World) running the operation and David Rockwell designing it. With $34 million in backing from Walt Disney and the insurance company Conseco, Underground was such a sure thing there was even talk of outlets in Disney's theme parks in California, Paris and Tokyo. But for various reasons, the magic just wasn't there. Though 85% of the restaurant was completed, not one customer was ever served. Announced in 1997, the restaurant was dead by 1999. Parts of the building eventually became Mamma Sbarro’s and the nightclub Noche, later replaced by the recently troubled Spotlight Live. Another celeb-backed spot that looked like it was going to happen and then disappeared before opening day was a chicken-and-waffles joint in Harlem from the human beatbox himself, Doug E. Fresh. Though pictures of the place showed up online and Fresh even gave interviews about Doug E.'s last September, we haven't heard a peep since. And then there's The General Store. Backed by porn star Jenna Jameson and Heatherette designer Richie Rich, according to Page Six, the bar/clothing store was to be located in a former whorehouse in Chinatown but they declined to say exactly where or when. The duo claimed to be shooting for a 2008 opening, so there's still time for them to pull it off, but we're not holding our breath. In a slightly different vein are the big-name outsiders who make noise about looking for a home in the big city but then, unable to work New York's insane real estate in their favor, quietly slink away. LA's burger chain Fatburger was rumored to be interested in coming to the Big Apple with locations in Harlem, Midtown and the Village. But nothing seems to have happened, and no New York locations are currently listed on the chain's coming soon page. A similar fate seems to have struck the ever-popular Floridian Joe's Stone Crab, which, despite rumors of a New York outpost, doesn't seem to be in much hurry to get its claws here. Lost in Translation And then there are the movers, places that existed in one NYC location (or more) but were forced out for various reasons. For instance, the East Village Yacht Club left its First Street digs in February (replaced by Arlo & Esme) and briefly moved into the former Kelley and Peng space on Second Street before evacuating so NBC could use the space for a cooking reality show called The Chopping Block. Though the bar may well return, we haven't heard a word in quite awhile. Another one whose reincarnation we're waiting for is Lo Scalco. The well-reviewed but short-lived Italian closed in summer 2006 on Church Street with plans to start over in a better, more appropriate Midtown location. Sadly, that was the last we heard of it. Similarly, after leaving TriBeCa in August 2006, the sports bar Buster's Garage has announced two new locations only to buck up against community backlash each time. And then there's the plight of celebrity chef Will Goldfarb. After making enough of a name for himself with his treats temple, Room 4 Dessert, to garner a six-page profile in The New Yorker, an ownership dispute forced Goldfarb to kill the restaurant in May 2007. Though a sequel was promised, it has yet to materialize. In the meantime Goldfarb has busied himself with sandwich stands and a specialty powders-and-spice online store called WillPowder. Less highfalutin but still very popular, University Place barbecue haven BBQ (not to be confused with Dallas BBQ) abruptly closed last fall to make way for a bank. Rumor had it that the restaurant was going to move further west on Eighth Street, but almost a year later nothing has happened. And then there is the imaginatively titled Burger Joint (no relation to the Le Parker Meridien establishment of the same name) that used to flip patties at 220 Third Avenue. After being closed by the Department of Health in May 2007, it planned to move across the street. But as far as we can tell, the burgers are still waiting for the green light. Of course, we do expect some of these places to find a new home eventually. On the \"more likely to reappear in some form\" side is the infamous nightspot the Copacabana. After the third incarnation of the hottest spot north of Havana closed last June (to make way for a subway station), the owners have been holding lots of events at the Columbus 72 venue, but still have hopes for a permanent home. One location, on West 18th Street, was briefly announced, but nothing seems to have been finalized. With such a glut of press covering the food industry in New York, it's hard to blame a restaurant-to-be for trying to get some hype before opening (or reopening, as the case may be). And we're always happy when restaurants open in our fair city, but as we enter into the annual season of hype that is fall, it can be instructive to remember that hype can sometimes be just that: hype. – With help from Larry Cohn

Wiliamsburg, never a neighborhood with a shortage of whistle-wetting options, now has a few more. Already open are two new bars: Near the Bedford stop, a comfy new spot called The Gibson (108 Bedford Ave.; 718-218-7891) replaces the Triple Crown, which takes advantage of its corner space with windows that swing open to the street. Further east, things get a little more upscale at The Richardson (451 Graham Ave.; 718-389-0839), which pairs its modern-speakeasy decor with more than a dozen beers on tap and hand-crafted cocktails poured by bartenders sporting matching black vests and studded belts. Finally, for imbibers wanting something a little gentler, an outpost of Saint Alp’s Teahouse is set to bring bubble teas and Asian snacks to the neighborhood in September (164 Bedford Ave.).

Well over a year after Montrachet's soft closing, its TriBeCa home is coming back on the scene. During the week of Labor Day, Drew Nieporent's latest, Corton, will start serving its Modern French cuisine from chef Paul Liebrandt (ex Gilt). The prix fixe–only restaurant will offer a tasting menu ($110) and a three-course prix fixe ($76) under the vaulted ceilings of its 65-seat dining room. It's named after the largest area of Grand Cru in Burgundy, so expect an extensive list of wines from that region, mais oui (239 West Broadway; 212-219-2777).

Tony and Cathy Mantuano Though it seems like the Olympics just started, another major sporting event is right around the corner, and this one is a touch closer to home than Beijing. The balls hit the court at the U.S. Open on August 25th and keep flying until September 7th, and as usual those who come to the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in Flushing won't be let down by the event's concessions (which even 10 years ago were \"just about as legendary as the tennis\"). Along with the usual array of dishes – ranging from Carnegie Deli's corned beef sandwiches to the lobster Cobb salad at the center's Aces restaurant to the lamb wraps from New Delhi Spice – this year's Open will also host the NYC debut of one of Chicago's top toques, Tony Mantuano, chef-partner at Spiaggia (ranked as the city's Best Italian in our last Survey). To celebrate the release of Mantuano's new cookbook, Wine Bar Food, the chef and his wife-coauthor, Cathy Mantuano, will be bringing a wine and mozzarella bar to the plaza in front of the stadium, where visitors can sample various cheeses paired with cured meats, marinated vegetables, peppers and olives. Other offerings will include prosciutto with shaved artichokes and hearts of palms, limoncello granitas and striped-bass crudo with pistachios, not to mention a selection of Italian wines. The authors will be on hand for the duration of the games.

Whether it will be able to differentiate itself among the many Thai restaurants in the neighborhood, however, remains to be seen (104 Second Avenue; 212-533-8900).

2 by 4 has a new name and a new awning. photo: Garth Johnston At 3:45 AM on July 17th, the NYPD arrested a female bartender at the East Village dive bar 2 by 4, and charged her with third-degree assault and possession of a weapon after she allegedly threw a pint glass at a customer. Later she was also charged with a graffiti offense for tagging while in lock-up. While it's probably completely unrelated, 2 by 4 is now sporting a new awning and a new name, Ambiance, less than a month after all this took place. Ambiance appears to be the same bar with the same owners, just with a new moniker. The phone number listed on the new awning is the same as the old one, but it was disconnected when the Buzz tried to call.

Of the restaurants that Zagat confirmed closed this week, a number of them resided Downtown. After years of serving drinks on the Bowery, Marion's Continental is leaving – just in time to escape the oncoming hordes. It closed officially this week after taking a few months off to be used in the filming of the upcoming reality show The Chopping Block. Over in the East Village, the Second Avenue branch of Burritoville rolled its last tortilla and Gasparino's boiled its last spaghetti. The Due Amici branch on West 14th Street is now a Pita Joe. In Uptown news, Ichimura, an upscale Japanese joint in Midtown East, is now known as ON.

Sure you're well-versed in the deliciousness of chicken, turkey and even duck. But beyond that, does your poultry palate get a little fuzzy? If only there were a good refresher course to point out where quail ends and squab begins. Enter Greenpoint's Paloma, which is hosting a \"game bird dinner\" tomorrow night. Former Top Cheftestant (and owner) Camille Becerra and chef Rene Ortiz (ex La Esquina) are planning on serving birds of every feather including appetizers with duck, quail, cocks combs and heritage turkey, and entrees featuring poussin, guinea hen, pheasant and squab. And really, what better way to get a grip on the poultry rainbow than in a side-by-side comparison; space is still available (8 PM; $100 per person including wine; 718-349-2400).

Joining the Time Warner Center's illustrious fourth-floor line-up (Masa, Per Se, Porter House), Clo is getting closer to opening. The wine bar from Andrew Bradbury, the sommelier from Las Vegas' Aureole, is hoping to pour its first bottles by next week. There will be more than 100 wines from around the world available in 2-oz. and 4-oz. pours; Clo will also serve cheese and charcuterie plates to help absorb all that alcohol. Tipplers who are having trouble deciding which ones to order will appreciate the interactive touch-screen (à la Adour) on the surface of the long communal table. (That's the only table, by the way, as Clo occupies a small-ish space on the balcony with great views of Columbus Circle.) There are also plans for a wine store (212-823-9898).

AQ Cafe Outpost Gains a \"K,\" Drops a Cuban Sandwich

***CONTENT
AQ Kafé In further Marcus Samuelsson news, the second outpost of the casual AQ Cafe is looking closer to opening just off Columbus Circle at 1800 Broadway, where the windows are papered with photos and names of Scandinavian goodies. Interestingly, the sign outside spells the restaurant’s name as “Kafé” (rather than the original's “cafe”), and the otherwise similar menu presents one glaring omission: the popular Nordic Cuban sandwich. Fingers are crossed that the missing sandwich (which is made of grilled Swedish ham, Jarlsberg cheese, pickled cucumbers and whole grain mustard) is just an oversight and not the work of some Swedish purist organization. UPDATE: The opening is projected for mid-to-late September.

From August 11th–17th, Marcus Samuelsson’s ode to Scandinavian gastronomy is holding its annual Crayfish Week. Along with the cafe's regular à la carte menu, lunch and dinner diners can indulge in a three-course prix fixe that features crayfish bisque or toast, grilled tenderloin beef or a seafood stew, and a berry crisp with vanilla ice cream or a princess cake with raspberries ($48). Those who are just about the crustaceans can go for the \"crayfish peel and eat\" ($25), which includes one pound of the delicacies along with garlic bread, boiled potatoes and Jarlsberg cheese (for more information or to make a reservation, call 212-307-7311).

Chefs Go Fishing for Sustainable Seafood
***AUTHOR
BuzzEditor
***DATE
2009-08-06 00:00:00
***CONTENT
By Deirdre Donovan, ZAGAT.com Staff Editor With new technologies, aquarium outreach programs and a local focus, more chefs are going green. NYC chef Anita Lo serves Australis Barramundi. Diners are riding a wave of awareness regarding threats to oceanlife – but they don’t always know what to do about it. When a recent ZAGAT.com poll asked, “Do concerns about over-fishing and other threats to seafood populations affect your dining decisions?” 54% of respondents said they “try to order sustainable seafood but can’t always keep track of what they are supposed to order.” While there are ways for environmentally conscious diners to stay informed (see sidebar), chefs around the country are helping take the onus off customers by putting the “right” seafood on the menu. And since more than two-thirds (by value) of seafood consumed in the U.S. is eaten in restaurants, according to the Monterey Bay Aquarium, chefs have the potential to make a huge impact on the ocean’s health. Find Your Fish Organizations including Seafood Choices Alliance and Greenpeace offer charts and cards to help consumers make informed choices about the seafood on their plates. And some information has gone mobile – the status of an item on the Monterey Bay Aquarium’s Seafood Watch list can be checked via any handheld device, and the Blue Ocean Institute's FishPhone makes it easy to text for up-to-date info right from the table. You don’t have to tell that to chef Ted Walter and wife Cindy, owners of Passionfish in Pacific Grove, CA. When they’re not preparing dishes featuring sustainable fish – for example, California sturgeon in charmoula marinade, or tilapia with garlic-balsamic-vinegar butter – they’re working to spread their mantra that \"smart harvesting can strengthen global fish stocks\" by offering public presentations, forums for culinary students and professionals, and through legislative advocacy. Cindy’s efforts helped lead to Pacific Grove’s adoption in 2005 of a Sustainable Seafood Resolution, making it one of only two cities to do so (San Francisco was the first). The resolution encourages restaurants and markets “to give preference to seafood harvested in a sustainable way” and to opt for local seafood. Local is key at the East Coast Grill in Cambridge, MA, where chef-owner Chris Schlesinger, a fisherman himself, has long-standing relationships with providers that he trusts. “I stay informed about seafood stocks,” says Schlesinger, who features the likes of sea scallops from New Bedford, MA, harpooned swordfish and a daily fish that's \"wicked fresh, wicked local\" on his menu. Seafood Choices Alliance partners with Charting Nature for illustrated posters with descriptions of sustainable fish and shellfish. Growing your own can work too. San Francisco’s Hog Island Oyster Company raises its own Sweetwater, Atlantic and Kumomoto bivalves with sustainable methods in the Tomales Bay. Of course, not every restaurant can raise its own seafood. But there are plenty of other ways for toques to support healthy oceans. Aquariums across the country have programs to promote sustainable seafood, including partnerships with restaurants. At Boston’s New England Aquarium, the Celebrate Seafood dinner series features sustainable seafood plus appearances by guest chefs from local restaurants like Beacon Hill Bistro, Chez Henri, Garden at the Cellar and Sel de la Terre. The evenings include cooking demos and discussions; the menus highlight wild-caught fish such as striped mullet, Alaskan salmon, mahi mahi, wahoo and bluefish along with responsibly farmed oysters, mussels, clams, bay scallops, barramundi and cobia. In Chicago, the Shedd Aquarium’s Right Bite program not only partners with chefs for special dinners, but helps restaurants plan menus. Right Bite participants promise to have at least one sustainable seafood dish on their menus at all times and take off at least one unsustainable seafood item; their staffs receive special training twice a year. The program has attracted Carnivale, which features dishes like arctic char ceviche and Shaw’s Crab House, which serves items like sautéed Lake Erie Walleye with horseradish crust. Carrie Nahabedian has also signed up her top-rated Naha, whose sustainable dishes feature the likes of wild Great Lakes whitefish and native lobster. Long a leader in ocean education, The Monterey Bay Aquarium’s Seafood Watch program began in 1999 as a way to raise consumer awareness. Sheila Bowman, the program’s outreach manager, explains that restaurants became involved when consumers, armed with seafood guides, went out to dinner and started asking questions. “At first chefs were like ‘What the heck is that aquarium doing?’” she says. But in the last two years a widespread shift occurred. “Chefs had started looking at where their beef, pork, produce, dairy and even wine came from before they started looking at seafood. Ultimately they looked at seafood,” says Bowman. What is Sustainable Seafood? SeaChoice describes it as \"fish that are caught or farmed with consideration for the long-term viability of individual marine species and for the oceans’ ecological balance as a whole.\" There’s now a restaurant component to Seafood Watch, with members pledging to eschew items from the organization’s “avoid” list. Participants include rm (Las Vegas), which brings the message to the table with farm-raised Ocean Rose Abalone and bigeye tuna that’s hook-and-line caught from a sustainable population in Hawaii; Ciudad (LA), where marinated white anchovy with lemon, garlic and parsley makes the menu; and Fish (Sausalito), which highlights seasonal fish, line-caught local albacore tuna and local Miyagi oysters. Improved fish-farming techniques are another boon for sustainably minded chefs. Australis U.S.-farmed Barramundi, for example, is raised indoors with a special system that keeps the water clean. The fish meets environmental and sustainability standards and has been given a place on Seafood Watch’s “Best Choice” listing. It can be found on the menu at Napa’s famed French Laundry, where chef Thomas Keller serves it sautéed with potato confit, piquillo peppers, chorizo and arugula. At Charlie Palmer’s Las Vegas Aureole, it’s pan-seared and served with citrus-braised butter lettuce and carrot-orange reduction. In NYC, Anita Lo (Annisa) prepares it with artichokes, garlic chives and black trumpet sauce. Kona Kampachi Meanwhile, open-water aquaculture farms have modernized as well. Kona Kampachi, a Hawaiian yellowtail, is raised “from hatch to harvest” with improved nets and water monitoring systems, sustainable sources for feed and a harvest-to-order system that cuts waste. New York chef Dan Barber (Blue Hill and Blue Hill at Stone Barns) offers it as a special in preparations such as crudo with panther soybeans and apple mustard. “Flavor is where we're leading with this stuff. I'm an environmentalist, but first and foremost, I'm a flavor guy...I decided to support this, getting behind the cause of how we want fish to be produced in the future,\" he says.

Hauling crates of peaches from the orchard to the shipping shed, Delta County, Colorado, September 1940. photo: Russell Lee, courtesy of the Library of Congress If you're a fan of stone fruits, you might want to head to any of the members of the Patina Restaurant Group, which is hosting its first annual peach and plum festival through September 14th. Each restaurant on both the East and West Coasts is offering its chef's take on the delicious fruits in a special à la carte, and prix fixe menus available for the next six weeks. At Rock Center Café, the three-course prix fixe includes options like sliced peaches with homemade ricotta and prosciutto, chilled peach soup, peach-barbecue chicken breast and peach-filled crêpes with vanilla ice cream ($38 per person, dishes also available à la carte; 212-332-7620). Over at the Sea Grill, the four-course menu features a crab salad with plums, butter-poached lobster and filet of beef served with grilled peaches, a cheese course with plum confit, and Chamomile-poached peaches for dessert ($72 per person; $100 with wine pairings; 212-332-7610). And at Midtown's Brasserie, à la carte is the only way to go, though with options including fresh goat cheese salad with shaved white peaches and nectarines ($13), crispy ducklings with caramelized peaches ($29) and a classic plum tart ($9) we doubt that will be a problem (212-751-4840). That's just the menus at three of the seven East Coast Patina restaurants; go to www.rapatina.com/peachesandplums/ for a complete list of restaurants and their menus.

Wildwood Barbeque photo: Wildwood Barbeque In its second year on the market, the Nintendo Wii is the clear winner amongst the current generation of video game consoles. And it isn't just with the kids – the device is so popular among adults that it's showing up in nursing homes and, recently, gyms. So it should be no surprise that the easy-to-learn gaming system is starting to appear in bars and restaurants too. The latest to add a Wii night is Flatiron barbecue joint Wildwood. Tonight, the B.R. Guest newcomer is hosting a 16-person, three-round Wii Boxing tournament. Sign-ups begin at 9 PM and the tournament starts at 9:30 PM, but inexperienced guests curious to give a Wii-mote a punch should feel free to head over for the pre-tournament warm-up at 8 PM. And in case all that boxing makes you thirsty, the bar will be serving $12 pitchers of \"Cold Ass Beer\" once the tournament gets underway (August 5; 212-533-2500).

Photo: Bethany L King Bars have long known that a happy hour is a great way to pull folks in and cultivate regulars, and there's no reason why restaurants can't do the same. To that end, the East Village's Belcourt has begun offering daily \"Oyster Hour(s)\" in the late afternoons from 4–7 PM, and the deal goes way beyond bivalves with the already affordable menu prices reduced to the bare minimum. A half-dozen oysters go for $10, soup or salad for $5, a pulled pork sandwich for $12 and a house-cured meat and pâté platter for $12; cocktails and wine by the glass are half-price too (212-979-2034).

With food costs steadily increasing and consumer confidence flat, it's a tough time to be in the restaurant business. To make things even worse, many of the city's high-spending diners go out of town for the month of August. Restaurateurs look fondly upon Summer Restaurant Week as a way to fill tables during the dining doldrums, but this year's enthusiasm for it is unprecedented. NYC & Company has just announced that 130 of the 230 restaurants participating in this year's Restaurant Week are preparing to extend their three-course prix fixe lunch ($24.07) and dinner ($35) deals through Labor Day. Some of the restaurants that are keeping the offer going include Aquavit, Café Boulud, ilili, Morimoto, Tabla and Vong. A complete list of restaurants participating in the extension should be available on www.NYCvisit.com on Friday at midnight.

After nearly twenty years in business, East 74th Street staple Coco Pazzo will be serving its last dinner service tonight. But fans of chef Mark Strausman needn't worry. You can still check out his work at Fred's at Barneys NY, his restaurant on the ninth floor of the clothing store at 660 Madison Avenue. In other closing news recently confirmed by Zagat, the Upper West Side has also said good bye to Cafe Mozart on West 70th and La Pizza Bolla on Amsterdam Avenue. On the East Side, Leonardo da Vinci on Second Avenue has served its last customers. In Midtown, Kyma on West 46th Street has closed as has Le Biarritz, which had been serving customers on West 57th Street since 1966. Downtown, Baxter's Pub on Baxter Street is now Whiskey Tavern. Danube, on Hudson Street, is closing on August 1st and will re-emerge as Secession. Pennyfeathers on Seventh Avenue South has given up the ghost, as has the Greenwich Street's Giorgione 508, the cafe/mini-market sib to nearby Giorgione.

Nobu Matsuhisa photo: Steven Freeman For our Secrets of Sushi Chefs series finale, we speak with Nobu Matsuhisa, whose eponymous restaurants are among the hottest tickets wherever they are around the world. From NYC to Milan to Tokyo, Matsuhisa titillates palates with his Peruvian-Japanese cuisine and oft-mimicked signature dishes like black cod with miso or yellowtail sashimi with jalapeño. Zagat Buzz: What differences, if any, do you find in sushi preparation and etiquette between the U.S. and Japan? Nobu Matsuhisa: A traditional sushi restaurant in Japan is a place for people to sip sake and enjoy sashimi and sushi. They serve sushi only, nothing else. But in the U.S., like in my restaurants here, we serve dishes from the hot kitchen like black cod and rock shrimp. ZB: What are some of the mistakes you see people making while dining at the sushi bar at Nobu? NM: Using too much soy sauce is one. Also, there is already wasabi in the sushi, so all you need to do is dab a bit of soy sauce on the fish side of the sushi and eat it. There is no need to mix wasabi into the soy sauce, you can ask the sushi chef to put a bit more wasabi in your sushi. ZB: What is your favorite thing to prepare or your favorite fish to work with? NM: White Fish Tiradito Nobu Style is my favorite dish to prepare; it's one of my signature dishes. ZB: What are the telltale signs that distinguish an expert sushi eater vs. an amateur? NM: An expert sushi eater knows the names of all different types of fish. ZB: Where do you go to eat after your shift? NM: I usually go home, but if I do go out it's for something light like soba noodles or, if I'm in Japan, ramen noodles. - Christina Livadiotis Nobu's signature dish of broiled black cod with miso photo: Steven Freeman Read the other interviews in our series with Naomichi Yasuda of Sushi Yasuda and Don Pham of Geisha.

The Umami Grind

***CONTENT
Chef Tokuoka's bonito slicer The chef at work on his umami menu We recently had the chance to watch chef Kunio Tokuoka (of Kyoto’s Kitcho) at work in TriBeCa's Bouley Test Kitchen as he finalized his menu for an umami-focused dinner at the James Beard House. Umami is described as the “fifth taste” (following sweet, sour, salty and bitter), and though its exact flavor can be hard to describe, “savory” is the term most frequently bandied about. First classified in Japan in 1908, umami occurs in a variety of glutamate-rich foods including kelp, tomatoes and even Parmesan cheese, as well as in that most infamous of flavor-enhancers, MSG. Another food full of the stuff is bonito, and in preparation for his menu at the Beard House, Tokuoka brought over his own slicer from Japan. So where does a world-renowned chef go to eat on his second-ever trip to New York? Bouley, naturally, and Benjamin Steakhouse, which supplied the beef for the dinner. Surprisingly, with all the hoopla in this country surrounding Kobe beef, Tokuoka opined, “The meat here is tastier than in Japan. Japanese meat is good, but you don’t eat a lot of it.”

Since our previous posting, The Buzz has learned more about Rouge Tomate, the Brussels spin-off landing at 10 East 60th Street in October. Even though it shares the same name as its Belgian parent, it won't be a clone. Expect New American cuisine with an emphasis on seasonal and sustainable ingredients – think dishes like lightly cured arctic char with smoked sea salt and pasture-raised hanger steak with buttermilk-parsnip purée and warm mushroom vinaigrette from chef Jeremy Bearman. The decor won't resemble the colorful Belgian one – they're keeping the walnut-wood floor (from former tenant Nicole Farhi) and adding back-lit oak wood walls .

Tailor photo: Ryan Charles On Tuesday night, Zagat Presents and one-year-old SoHo hot spot Tailor teamed up for an evening of food and \"Tailor-made\" cocktails. The event, which started with an early drink lesson with mixologist Eben Freeman and then more drinks paired with three courses from chef Sam Mason including fluke with pine-needle ponzu, duck with cherry tapenade and arugula, and celery ice cream with fresh strawberries and celery root cake, filled up so quickly that they're doing it again next Wednesday – though with a slightly different menu that's still in the works. If you can get out of the office a bit early that day, we thoroughly recommend arriving in time for the drink-making session with Freeman (July 30; seatings at 6 PM (with a drinking-making demo at 5 PM) and 9 PM; $65 per person; to reserve call 212-334-5182 and mention \"Zagat Presents\").

Decoding Community Board Doublespeak
***AUTHOR
BuzzEditor
***DATE
2009-07-23 00:00:00
***CONTENT
Like most bureaucracies, Community Boards have their own lingo that can confuse the untrained ear. For instance, when the Manhattan Community Board 3 votes on recommendations for liquor licenses, it doesn't just say that it approves the application. That would be too simple. Instead it currently uses language that goes along the lines of \"Community Board 3 votes to deny approval unless [restaurant] agrees to the following stipulations...\" The applicants must then sign the stipulation, have it notarized and returned to the committee before the full board meeting. Then, on the basis of that strange phrasing, the board votes to recommend that the State Liquor Authority give a restaurant its license, and hopes the applicants do as they promised. Unfortunately, this can lead to misunderstandings with first timers. For instance, Eater reports that \"Lok Sing Chinese, Friend House, Obrigado, Zerza, Rolo, Pho So, and the Kelley and Ping [sic] space, were all denied transfers, alterations, or upgrades.\" In fact, according to our sources who were at last night's meeting, all of those restaurants – except Friend House, see below – were \"denied unless\" they agreed to previously discussed stipulations. Which is to say, they passed muster with the community board and now just need approval from the SLA. For an example of how these resolutions look, here is what was voted on and approved regarding the space at 325 Bowery (the old Kelley and Peng space): VOTE: To deny unless applicant agrees to operate as a full service Sicilian restaurant, with hours of operation Sun/Tues/Wed - 11:OO AM to Midnight; Thurs/Fri/Sat - 11 AM - 2:30 AM Applicant further reiterates that it will not request a sidewalk cafe, and agrees that it will close its French windows at 10 PM, that the establishment will only play background music, that the establishment will use speakers, but no amplifiers, that the establishment will not host live music, that the establishment will serve food until within one hour of closing, and that the establishment's last seating will be no later than 10:30 PM on all nights. Another bit of confusion with these meetings is that attendance is mandatory for parties seeking licenses (see above). Though Eater reports that \"what is assumed to be Gabe Stulman's place, Penmanship\" was approved for a new liquor license, that is in fact incorrect. Mr. Stulman was not in attendance at last night's meeting, which means he missed his chance and will now have to restart his application process. Besides Stulman, representatives from Zatkaria Latzka, 174 Rivington, and Friend House also all failed to appear and must start again in their quest to serve alcohol.

Tipping ’Em Back at Tales of the Cocktail

Home base for Tales of the Cocktail was the revolving Carousel Bar at the Hotel Monteleone. photo: Karen Hudes Forget amateur night – the biggest rager in the country last weekend was at Tales of the Cocktail, the annual New Orleans festival that draws the most accomplished, ambitious and creative players in the world of bartending and mixology. The big names were all there (Dale DeGroff, Gary Regan, Pegu Club’s Audrey Saunders) as well as plenty of newcomers soaking up knowledge at scores of seminars, tastings and late-night parties. The Buzz visited the alcohol-fueled scene to distill the latest trends. In the pink: Scott Beattie's market-driven cocktail photo: Karen Hudes Culinary Cues: Cocktails are going “hyper-seasonal,” in the words of one panelist, as bartenders develop relationships with farmers to get the right botanicals for their drinks. That adds up to elements like the lemon verbena–infused syrup and dehydrated peach-chip garnish used by Scott Beattie (Sonoma County’s Cyrus) and refreshing tomato water prepared by Todd Thrasher (Restaurant Eve in Alexandria, VA) for his Bloody Mary. Two green-minded Brooklyn impresarios told the Buzz they’re going hands-on this year, with a bar in the works where the herbs for infusions and garnishes will be grown on-site. Micro-Distilling: More and more mixologists are learning their way around a still, and licensed micro-distilleries are popping up around the country, including two producing absinthe in Oregon. For one cocktail, bourbon (made with all-local corn) by the Hudson Valley’s Tuthilltown Spirits was blended with New York apple butter and maple syrup to make a pleasing tipple with a wealth of terroir. And since former Eliot Spitzer signed a bill last year making it legal for farmers to distill what they grow, expect to see more homegrown micros on the way. Feeling Bitter: Ted Haigh (aka Dr. Cocktail, curator of the just-opened Museum of the American Cocktail in New Orleans) sees a trend in bartenders making their own bitters too. “They want to recreate Boker’s Bitters, Abbott’s Bitters,” he says, and some small companies like Fee Brothers are heeding the call, bringing back previously extinct flavors. Garnish Recap: Some of the most fragrant and eye-catching toppers of the weekend included a half-fig, a shiso leaf and a sprig of mint smacked in the bartender's palm. Look out for foams, flowers, house-pickled produce and crystallized powders from liqueurs making a statement on the rim. New Sensation: A standing-room-only crowd squeezed in for a seminar on molecular mixology. Like its gastronomic counterpart, the gist is using science – knowing the chemical properties of the liquids you’re working with and the tools at your disposal – to intensify flavors and re-contextualize familiar notes. Eben Freeman of NYC's Tailor pulled it off with a New Orleans twist, presenting a Ramos Gin Fizz marshmallow and Sazerac gummi bear, while a vodka rep presented the audience with groan-inducing but admittedly amusing Red Bull cotton candy. Among other topics, Jamie Boudreau (Vessel in Seattle) discussed “fat-washing” to get the flavor of bacon without the slickness. “People are eager to try new ideas and disgusting things,” says Freeman, who thinks the public is “over feeling safe.” Even when he’s not testing palates with hops-infused liquors and the like, he’s keen on stirring up “profound emotional experiences” with memory triggers like scotch infused with pumpernickel raisin bread, and “bringing back the first impressions of flavors,” serving customers perception-bending renditions of rum and Coke in solid form. LeNell Smothers plays doctor photo: Karen Hudes Hangover Cure: LeNell Smothers, the saucy owner of LeNell’s wine and liquor shop in Red Hook, always keeps the tone down-home. At her seminar on using eggs in cocktails, she concluded by asking, “Have you ever had a proper Prairie Oyster?” She then demonstrated the hangover cure by having a buff volunteer take off his shirt and lie down on the table. She proceeded to crack eggs, add salt and pepper, Worcestershire and Tabasco and licked the result off his stomach before a thrilled audience. Which all shows the professionals can get as down and dirty as anyone, they just know how to do it properly. – Karen Hudes

Sushi Chef Secrets: Don Pham

***CONTENT
The \"sushi sandwiches\" at Geisha In the second of a series of interviews with notable sushi chefs, we sit down with Don Pham of Geisha, a hip Upper East Side boîte serving French-influenced Japanese cuisine. Having joined Geisha at its inception in 2003 at the tender age of 21, Pham has risen to the post of executive sushi chef. He’s all about innovation – he loves creating exotic sushi “sandwiches” – but don’t let him catch you using a knife and fork. Geisha's executive sushi chef Don Pham Zagat Buzz: What differences, if any, do you find in sushi preparation and etiquette between the U.S. and Japan? Don Pham: Well I am from Vietnam and have only passed through Japan once in my lifetime, so I can’t really compare to Japan. ZB: What are some mistakes you see people making while dining at the sushi bar at Geisha? DP: Sometimes, I see people putting soy sauce all over the sushi or dipping the piece of sushi into the soy sauce and leaving it there for such a long time. This is a big mistake, because every piece of fish just ends up tasting like soy sauce and not the fish. Another thing, it is killing me to see people use a knife and fork while eating their sushi. Sushi is not supposed to be cut. I make my sushi bite-size, whether it is a roll or just a piece of sushi, for a reason. You are meant to eat it in one bite; that is how you get all the flavors together. When I see people using a fork and knife, I often interject and say if you don’t know how to use chopsticks, please just use your hands. It’s a roll, not a piece of steak! ZB: What is your favorite thing to prepare or your favorite fish to work with? DP: My black truffle tuna sandwich, which is made with blue fin tuna from Spain, black truffles, avocado and chives, with rice and nori serving as the bread. I also love working with white tuna, which is very unique at Geisha, because it is Wanu white tuna from Waikiki Beach in Hawaii. This tuna is pure white with a texture similar to toro. ZB: What are the telltale signs that distinguish an expert sushi eater vs. an amateur? DP: If someone sits at my sushi bar and starts ordering mackerel, uni and anago, I can tell that this person is a well-seasoned sushi eater. If someone begins ordering tuna, salmon and yellowtail and, of course, California rolls, I can tell that he is probably not a sushi expert. ZB: And yet there is a California roll on your menu. DP: The California roll at Geisha is made with fresh snow crab, so you know, it’s special here. ZB: Where do you go to eat after you’re finished working? DP: I usually like to have the chef here at Geisha prepare something for me before my shift, since I don’t get off until usually midnight or 1 AM. When I do eat after my shift, it’s usually at a small ramen place nearby, like Riki (250 East 52nd St.).

Coming Soon: Hudson Cafe Market, Naya, Rouge Tomate

***CONTENT
Coming this fall to The Helena, the luxury rental building on 11th Avenue and West 57th Street, is the Hudson Café Market, the third establishment from Jack and Charles Trantides, the brothers behind Ammos restaurants. Instead of Greek food like the other two, this 4,300-sq.-ft. space (with a marketplace) will focus on contemporary American comfort food. The menu will be designed by David Ogren, the chef at Ammos and an alum of the French Laundry (601 W. 57th St.). Opening in August, on the other side of Midtown, will be the much smaller, 50-seat Naya. With a menu of classic Lebanese dishes, it aims to make meze the new small plates. Located on the site of a former Blimpie, the tiny restaurant boasts buffed decor from SOMA Architects as well as aspirations to branch out into franchises if its affordable eats catch on (1057 Second Ave.; 212-319-7777). Planning for a mid-fall debut a few blocks up and over is Brussels import Rouge Tomate. For its first stab at a U.S. presence, the tomato-loving Eclectic restaurant chain with a penchant for fresh ingredients and bright red-and-white color schemes will fill the 16,000-sq.-ft. space that formerly housed Nicole Farhi. Jeremy Bearman (ex SF's Lark Creek Steak) will run the kitchen. By the time it opens, the recent tomato-salmonella scare will be – we hope – a distant memory (10 E. 60th St.).

***CONTENT
North Square Nothing beats a special meal paired with just the right libations – especially when you get a chance to learn something new at the same time. Here are three upcoming evenings geared toward doing just that: Seafood fans and those curious about less-ripened \"green\" wines should head to Divine Bar in Midtown for the first installment of its new \"Vino-versity.\" Wines at the event range from champagne to Sauvignon Blanc to Portugal's literally green wine, Vinho Verde, and they'll be paired with a seafood selection including ceviche and sushi (July 29, 6:30–8:30 PM; $38 per person in advance by phone; $48 at the door if available; 212-265-9463). Over in the East Village that same night, Knife + Fork's chef-owner Damien Brassel is going for something a little headier. His European restaurant is hosting a five-course tasting menu paired with a selection of beers from Coney Island Lager. Dishes planned include house-cured salmon with a ginger, lemon, cilantro and fennel salad served with Albino Python; lemon thyme- and tea-cured pork belly with turnip puree served with Sword Swallower; and a warm chocolate fondant with fig compote and a goat cheese puree served with Rejuvenator (8 PM; $60 per person; 212-228-4885). A little further west, New American North Square is hosting a rosé lesson in its Deco Room on August 5th. Led by wine director Raoul Segarra, the evening will pair a four-course meal of Serrano ham and seasonal fruit, foie gras pate, grilled salmon with hijiki rice, and a barbecue short-rib sandwich with Segarra's favorite rosés (6–8 PM; $60 per person; 212-254-1200).

Chef Kunio Tokuoka has cooked at Kitcho in Kyoto since the age of 15, eventually rising to the position of head chef. Over the years, he’s perfected the art of umami – the hard-to-define “fifth taste” – in his contemporized kaiseki menus, and on July 29th at the James Beard House, he’ll be preparing a special dinner, “Umami – A Modern Japanese Degustation.” The multicourse feast will feature hors d’oeuvres like kombu broth–simmered onions on sliced beef with pickled plum and mains like lobster and sea urchin with Tosa vinegar gelée and steamed vegetables (7 PM; $500 per person, $450 for members; 212-627-2308).

Dispatches From an SLA Meeting

***CONTENT
For years, getting a liquor license was one of the least exciting parts of opening a restaurant. But as areas like the Lower East Side have been overrun with restaurants and bars, all that has changed. In the end, the fate of a restaurant's liquor license lies in the hands of the New York State Liquor Authority (SLA). Before it gets there, a restaurant must first go before a Community Board's SLA committee, whose suggestions the SLA follows very closely these days – especially in high-density areas. SLA committee meetings in high-tension areas like those served by Community Boards Two and Three in Lower Manhattan can go for more than five hours. Last night's Community Board 3 meeting, which had over 40 items on its agenda, was no exception. On the plus side, the meetings also provide a great glimpse into a neighborhood's drinking and dining future. The first half of the evening was devoted to restaurants like The EU and Nomad that were looking to add or extend the hours of their sidewalk cafes (Nomad got an extra hour of outdoor time and EU got approval to add outdoors seats pending a meeting with its local block association). The rest of the night focused on licenses for upcoming establishments. There will be a new restaurant from the team behind the Little Owl and Market Table called Penmanship; located in the old butcher shop on 124 First Avenue between Seventh Street and St. Mark's, it plans to embrace history of its space by keeping as much of the shop as possible – including the tile and large fridge. Some other new spots that were approved for licenses include a Brazilian restaurant at 211 Avenue A called Obrigado, an Italian at 32 Avenue A called Rolo, a slow-food Italian called Piedmont at 95 Allen Street and an open-kitchen Spanish restaurant named after its owner, Eda Kilic, at 432 East 13th Street. Also of note was an application that was approved for a new, as yet unnamed, Sicilian restaurant aiming to open in the old Kelley and Peng space at 325 Bowery by the fall (though a lease has yet to be signed). Now those are just the places that were approved. Many more met a less exciting fate and were forced to either come back with a new proposal or scrap their plans altogether. Update: To clarify some confusion, the new restaurant going into 124 First Avenue is from Gabriel Stulman, of the Little Owl and Market Table, but is a separate venture. Further, Penmanship is only its corporation name, not the name of the restaurant.

Kobe Club has a few seats still available for Restaurant Week. Photo: Noah Kalina Summer Restaurant Week (July 21–25 and July 28–August 1) is fast approaching and eager diners are snapping up reservations for those $24.07 prix fixe lunches and $35 prix fixe dinners. It's no surprise in this economy that Restaurant Week lunches and dinners are completely booked up at Gramercy Tavern. Chanterelle, Eleven Madison Park and Nobu, which all offer the deal only during lunch (like many of the most popular places), are full too. Still, there are many other participating restaurants with space available – at least for now. Cipriani's Wall Street (212-699-4096), Megu (212-964-7777), Metrazur (212-687-4600), Park Room (212-521-6655), Tribeca Grill (212-941-3900) and Water's Edge (718-482-0033) have reservations left on most days for lunch and dinner; so does Aquavit (212-307-7311), which is also offering the special pricing on the weekend of July 26th–27th. Lunch-only participants Gotham Bar & Grill (212-620-4020) and Tocqueville (212-647-1515) have space as well. Meanwhile, Bar Boulud (212-595-0303), Kobe Club (212-644-5623), maze (212-468-8889) and The Modern (212-333-1220) can only satisfy Restaurant Week diners looking for late lunches or late dinners. Some restaurants have generously decided to keep the deal going past August 1st. Union Square Cafe (212-243-4020) will offer its RW-priced lunches that weekend, August 2nd–3rd. Fleur de Sel (212-460-9100) is extending the special lunch pricing through Labor Day, including weekends. Le Cirque (212-644-0202), whose Restaurant Week dinners (but not lunches) are fully booked through August 1st, is extending the $35 prix fixe dinner in its cafe through the end of August (after which the cafe goes back to being no-reservations).

Get to the Berkshires for the Tanglewood Wine & Food Classic Heading to Tanglewood, the Boston Symphony Orchestra's summer outpost in Lenox, MA, usually means classical music and a picnic. But from Thursday, August 7th–Sunday, August 10th, it also means the 2008 Tanglewood Wine & Food Classic, an annual foodie fest featuring a variety of delicious events. The main action takes place at Saturday's Grand Tasting, which features hundreds of wines to sip, many dishes to sample and hourly cooking demos by chefs like Beantown's Jeffrey Fournier of 51 Lincoln and Andy Husbands of Tremont 647 (noon–4 PM; $105 per person; Tanglewood grounds; see more details). Other highlights include Thursday night's Gala Dinner & Wine Auction, with a menu prepared by chefs from NYC's Bar Boulud and local Lenox favorite, Wheatleigh, and an auction to benefit the BSO's youth and family programs (6 PM; $225 per person; the Seranak building at Tanglewood; reserve your spot). There are also wine and food seminars on Friday and Saturday (times vary; most cost $40 or $25 with Grand Tasting ticket; see seminar listing) and a Sunday brunch at Cheever Hill, a nearby farm with fantastic views (11:30 AM–1:30 PM; $100 per person; $125 paired with a lawn ticket for Sunday's concert at Tanglewood; prices include transportation to the farm; find out more).

Sushi Chef Secrets: Naomichi Yasuda

***CONTENT
Naomichi Yasuda photo: Christina Livadiotis Sushi may figure prominently in many a restaurant-goer’s diet these days, but how much do you actually know about its preparation, the etiquette surrounding it and what those masters behind the counter really think of their customers? In the first of a series of interviews with top sushi chefs, we sit down with Naomichi Yasuda of Sushi Yasuda, NYC’s top-rated Japanese restaurant. A traditionalist who takes pride in every single cut of fish (so much so that he’ll study an eater’s mouth to determine the appropriate piece size for that particular diner), he discusses the differences between American and Japanese sushi restaurants, why freshness can be overrated and more. Zagat Buzz: What differences, if any, do you find between sushi preparation and etiquette in the U.S. and in Japan? Naomichi Yasuda: There are two Japans: old Japan and new Japan. Old Japan is what I follow here at Sushi Yasuda and focuses more on traditional sushi making, with special attention paid to the rice and to correct portion size. Here at Sushi Yasuda, rice is very important and I make and season my own rice, like they used to in Japan. Also, the nice clean small slices are the way of traditional Japan and what you see here. New Japan mirrors more of what America is now in relation to sushi. No individual attention is paid to any particular piece of sushi. ZB: I can see that you make and serve every piece one-by-one here. NY: Yes, this is old Japan. Big cuts are seen as a positive thing in this new sushi world, which is not necessarily true. Also, people think that the fresher a fish is the better it is. This is generally true, but some fish are actually better after a day or two of preparation. Old Japan is standard. I am standard. You see nothing extraordinary here. Extraordinary is new Japan. ZB: What are the telltale signs that distinguish an expert sushi eater vs. an amateur? NY: Everyone is the same to me! … No matter what fish someone orders or how they order it, they are here for the food, so they are the same to me. There is no black belt or white belt here. Fish is fish. They don’t have passports or religion or race. It is just fish. Although when someone asks me to make something special, something different, I do not do it. I don’t do special. ZB: What is your favorite thing to prepare? NY: I like working with mackerel, squid and anything in the tuna family. ZB: Where do you go to eat after your shift? NY: I work most days so I don’t get out to eat much. But when I do, I like going to Irish places. I like their sausages. I’ll go to Sugiyama once in a while also, or Sushiden. - Christina Livadiotis

Rue Montorgueil, Paris, Festival of 30 June 1878 Claude Monet You don't have to go to Paris to get into the spirit of Bastille Day – New York is full of places to show your Gallic pride. Because July 14th falls on a Monday, the city's two biggest celebrations have been moved to Sunday the 13th. But on the actual holiday, plenty of French restaurants around town will be serving special meals and drinks to celebrate their independence. On Sunday, July 13th, the French Institute Alliance Française once again hosts its annual Gallic celebration, Bastille Day on 60th. Loads of French treats like crêpes and frites along with live music, can-can dancers, raffles, and children's activities like face painting and tournoi de pétanque (street bowling), should make for a festive afternoon (noon–6 PM; free to the public; E. 60th St. from Fifth Ave. to Lexington Ave.). Also on the 13th, over in Brooklyn, Smith Street between Bergen and Pacific will be taken over by the annual Bastille party and Petanque tournament. The block's resident bistro, Bar Tabac, will have its grill out on the street offering fare like merguez sandwiches with frites ($6). There will also be live music ranging from French gypsy tunes to American big band jams (noon–10 PM; free to the public). On the Upper West Side on July 14th, Alouette will be offering special dishes served along with special Ricard cocktails (212-222-6808). For the holiday, Alain Ducasse's newest bistro, Benoit, will be keeping its festivities to the bar area, but that doesn't mean it's holding back. While a DJ spins tunes, guests will be offered discounted select drinks and complimentary fare like croque monsieur, egg mayo, a type of pizza called pissaladière and bleu, blanc and rouge macarons for dessert (5–10 PM; 646-943-7373). TriBeCa brasserie Cercle Rouge gets into the action on July 14th with live music, a three-course prix fixe of French favorites and lots of decorations evoking the French revolution. Yes, there will be a guillotine (6 PM–closing; $39.95 per person; 212-226-6252). L'Absinthe will have live accordion music and decorations to go along with its regular à la carte menu. The chef's specials for the night will stick with the holiday though and include crab cakes with asparagus in a lobster reduction ($18), poire belle Helene, aka poached pears with vanilla ice cream ($14) and \"Marie Antoinette headless trout\" with ratatouille ($29; 212-794-4950). At Le Bonne Soupe, those looking for a French fix will be privy to a three-course prix fixe including a \"Normandy summer cocktail,\" frog legs, puff pastry with mushrooms, grilled rib eye with Bearnaise sauce and pommes boulangeres and crème brûlée (6:30–11 PM; $32 per person; 212-586-7650). West Village bistro Le Gigot is taking Bastille day to the next level, honoring the holiday for an entire week. From the 13th–20th it will offer a three-course prix fixe featuring classic dishes like escargot, paté, duck confit, steak au poivre, crème brûlée and brioche pudding ($45 per person, $60 with wine pairing; 212-627-3737). Meatpacking bistro Paradou wants to emphasize the celebration aspect of the holiday. The restaurant is offering unlimited drinks and cocktails for the evening for a mere $25. Just don't forget that Monday is a work night (212-463-8345). Recently moved Park Avenue Bistro is serving a three-course prix fixe. Along with dishes like frog legs, escargot, mussels and frites, crispy duck and profiterolles au chocolat, diners will be treated to a complimentary glass of wine from the meal's sponsor, Lillet ($35 per person; 212-689-1360). Upper East Side favorite François Payard’s Payard Bistro is also offering a three-course prix fixe dinner for July 14th. The special menu includes \"crispy pig's feet\" with haricot verts (string beans), a twice-baked cheese soufflé, monkfish with baby artichokes, pork chops with lemon crust and apricot-pork jus and a vanilla-and-raspberry baked Alaska with blueberry sauce (5:45 PM on; $45 per person; 212-717-5252).

The Heartland Brewery's new \"Beer Goddess\" in action. photo: courtesy of the Heartland Brewery Looking for something different to tipple in the July heat? The city that never sleeps is working on some innovative drinks. For years, Greenwich Village's romantic One if by Land, Two if by Sea has played up stories of the ghost of Aaron Burr haunting its premises. And now on the 204th anniversary of Burr's infamous duel with Alexander Hamilton, the restaurant is introducing a drink named \"The Duel\" ($15). Making its debut on Friday, the drink is a made of \"dueling\" dark and light rums mixed with pineapple juice and fresh pureed strawberries. In other One if by Land news, it will be serving lunch for the first time ever during this summer's Restaurant Week. If politics of a more current bent is what you want in your drink, Brooklyn brewery Sixpoint Craft Ales is happily bringing back its popular Hop Obama ale. After the limited edition first batch of the brew named after the presumptive Democratic Presidential nominee was snatched up in no time, the brewery has brought it back indefinitely. While buying Hop Obama won't financially help the candidate's campaign, it will at least give you a taste of \"change.\" The brew is available in select bars in New York and Massachusetts including Pacific Standard in Brooklyn and Blind Tiger Ale House in Manhattan. Or maybe you just aren't happy with the size of your average brew? If you find yourself daydreaming of a draft larger than a pint (and making fewer trips to the bar), you might want to check out the new \"Beer Goddess\" at the Heartland Brewery. A hand-blown three-liter Pilsner glass, the Goddess is a beverage behemoth that holds more beer than a six-pack. Two-and-a-half cans more, to be exact. The question is, can you lift it? It's $49 for a full Goddess, but the price doesn't include the glass itself; available at all Heartland locations.

While established spots are still going strong – Sag Harbor's American Hotel nabbed the No. 1 rankings for both Appeal and Service in our just-released 2008 Hamptons Nightlife Survey, while Westhampton Beach's Annona scored highest for Decor – the area has also welcomed a slew of sizzling openings that stretch from the perennially swanky stomping grounds of Southampton to the previously sleepy surfer shores of Montauk. To help you navigate this burgeoning beach bar scene, we’ve put together a list of the newest debuts. There's something for everyone, from surf-chic courtesy of Steven Kamali and the Cain crew to Jeffrey Chodorow's East End outpost to glitzy nightspots for the bottle-service set. Grappa 62 Main St., Sag Harbor; 631-725-7427 Ed ‘Jean Luc’ Kleefield has retired Mumbo Gumbo, his Cajun-fish-fry concept in Sag Harbor, and replaced it with a considerably more sophisticated Italian enoteca; the wraparound bar might not be authentically Milanese, but it offers plenty of perches for sipping selections from the substantial wine list (including many local offerings) and noshing on light tapas and brick-oven pizzas. Kobe Beach Club photo: courtesy of Kobe Beach Club Kobe Beach Club 44 Three Mile Harbor Rd., East Hampton; 631-604-2610 Jeffrey Chodorow’s pricey East Hampton excursion is in the same building as Lily Pond, sending Kobe sliders over to famished partyers at that next-door nightclub; its own large, dark bar and patio area offer comparative calm and a selection of serious cocktails. La Playa 125 Tuckahoe Ln., Southampton; 631-287-2125 The Pink Elephant crew brings all of its requisite cachet, big-name DJs and guest hosts to this new 10,000-sq.-ft. dance club (the largest in Southampton) in the onetime Tavern space; as for the crowded dance floor, outdoor bottle-service cabanas offer a respite. Lily Pond 44 Three Mile Harbor Rd., East Hampton; 631-907-2790 Pull up alongside valet-parked Maseratis, Ferraris and Porsches and bring lots of cash to this sexy, trendy club in East Hampton (taking over the former Resort site) aimed at weekending fat cats; pricey bottle service is de rigueur inside the purple-lit lounge area, as are short skirts and a throbbing soundtrack, which completes the sensual vibe. Surf Lodge 183 Edgemere St., Montauk; 631-238-5190 A little bit of glitz comes to Montauk with this big-budget, well-thought-out makeover of the Lakeside Inn by the Cain crew and Steven Kamali; there are three different bars (two are outside) and a restaurant helmed by Top Chef hunk Sam Talbot, so it’s no wonder this triple-threat hotel-nightlife-dining destination at The End of the East End is already crammed with hordes of surfers, slackers, scenesters and strutters.

A bittersweet chocolate-praline crémeux with dark chocolate ice cream from Daniel. photo: BATTMAN The photographer Battman (aka Alan Batt) sees a lot of food. For his books of culinary photography – which range from an upcoming tome capturing colors in desserts to a book focusing on sandwiches – Batt has shot dishes produced in the kitchens of some of our most prestigious chefs. On Thursday, September 25th, many of those chefs will be coming together for Battman's fourth annual Great Gathering of Chefs, which benefits The Children's Storefront, a tuition-free elementary school in Harlem. This year's gathering looks to feature an impressive array of toques who will be preparing soups and desserts featured in Battman's books and chatting up guests. The list of participating chefs has yet to be finalized, but more than 100 restaurants ranging from A Voce to wd-50 are already confirmed for the event – the full list is available online at www.thegreatgatheringofchefs.com. All in all, it's a great opportunity to mingle with star chefs and sample some delicious soups and sweets. As a bonus to Buzz readers, if you order your ticket before August 1st, you'll receive a $10 discount on admission (14 E. 28th St.; $100 per person, $90 before August 1; call 212-228-8626 for more information).

Mad 46 is one of many rooftop bars open in the city. photo: Evan W. Miller Why take the jitney to the Hamptons when you can take an elevator to the clouds? Skyscrapers are the new boardwalks, it seems, with rooftop bars like Mad 46 and Highbar popping up across the Midtown skyline. But all those lofty terraces can blur together after awhile, so we've put together a map to help you avoid altitude-induced disorientation. Grab a cocktail, soak up the view and imagine you're king or queen of the world – or at least Midtown. Rooftop Bars in Midtown A Ava Lounge 210 W. 55th Street (between Broadway and Seventh Avenue); 212-956-7020 With \"awesome views\" down Broadway, this \"small yet sophisticated\" Midtown “aerie” merges a penthouse lounge with a roof deck for those willing to \"pay a premium\" in both bucks and \"attitude.\" B Bookmarks 299 Madison Avenue (41st Street); 212-983-4500 Reminiscent of the (imaginary) “rooftop of your own Manhattan apartment”, this “oasis above the Midtown fray” is “expensive”, but the “tight quarters” are still thronged with “Euro tourists” and other “cosmopolitan” types. C The Eagle 554 W. 28th Street (between 10th and 11th Avenues); 646-473-1866 “You can’t find more machismo” in Chelsea than at this “trashy, trampy” tavern where “rough-and-tumble” “daddies, bears” and assorted leathermen are on the “prowl”; Still, nobody can resist the “friendly” Sunday afternoon beer blasts on the roof deck. D Highbar 251 W. 48th Street (between Broadway and Eighth Avenue); 212-956-1300 Hell’s Kitchen’s latest rooftop, this velvet-ropey newcomer is a sleek double-decker that employs bamboo shoots, tropical plants and Hudson River views to draw its cool-cat crowd; much of the medium-size space is covered so inclement weather is never a problem here, and there’s a totally enclosed downstairs den for VIPs. E HK Lounge 405 W. 39th Street (Ninth Avenue); 646-354-9062 A “trendy place” in a “weird location” behind Port Authority, this slick bi-level venue \"on the pricey side\" lures a “cute”, “decidedly gay” crowd with an “airy” space equipped with “upscale” extras like an “amazing” loftlike lounge under a retractable roof. F Hustler Club 641 W. 51st Street (between 11th and 12th Avenues); 212-247-2460 Spread out over an entire city block in Way West Hell’s Kitchen, this mammary mecca is a mix of “quality” strippers, “neon lights” and ultrapricey cocktails; of course, no one’s “really there for the drinks” anyway, so sit back with the “high rollers” and “bachelor party” attendees and “enjoy the scenery.” G Local 1 Penn Plaza (33rd Street, between Seventh and Eighth Avenues); 212-629-7070 The newer Garment District satellite of this \"twentysomething\" bar is more arresting than its sibling thanks to a “cool rooftop” deck where “sloshed commuters” are entertained by “amazing Penn Station people-watching.” H Metro Grill Roof Garden 45 W. 35th Street (between Fifth and Sixth Avenues); 212-279-3535 This “surprise” rooftop crowning a Garment District hotel boasts a roomy if “plain” setup “overlooking the nearby Empire State Building”; a low-maintenance spot to meet “after work”, though the unimpressed protest it’s “a little too shabby” for the “pricey” tabs. I Patroon 160 E. 46th Street (between Lexington and Third Avenues); 212-883-7373 There’s “atmosphere” galore on the rooftop bar of this Midtown steakhouse where “pricey”, “top-notch” cocktails and “finger food” draw “after-work suits and ties.” Sadly, there’s “no late-night fun” to be had since they close fairly early (and they’re also closed weekends). J Rare View 303 Lexington Avenue (37th Street); 212-481-1999 Like the name says, “beautiful” Midtown panoramas are the draw at this “relaxed” seasonal rooftop bar that’s just the ticket on a “breezy summer night”; expect the usual “pricey drinks”, long lines and “tightly packed elevators”, so for best results “go early to avoid the craziness. K Red Sky 47 E. 29th Street (between Madison and Park Avenues); 212-447-1820 “Three floors with different themes” (a bar, a “curtain-draped” lounge and a tiki-themed “outdoor deck”) make this Gramercy Parker a “solid” enough destination; surveyors split on the vibe – “loads of fun” vs. “loud and crowded” – but most agree the “decor is pretty cheesy.” L Salon de Ning 700 Fifth Avenue (55th Street); 212-903-3097 A slight reworking of the Peninsula Hotel’s former Pen-Top bar, this ritzy rooftop offers inspiring Midtown views from its two outdoor terraces and glass-enclosed bar, now redone with a vague ‘Shanghai deco’ look (think lacquered screens and Chinese daybeds); of course, skyhigh tabs come with the lofty territory. M Sutton Place 1015 Second Avenue (between 53rd and 54th Streets); 212-207-3777 An “awesome” roof deck is the “main attraction on summer evenings” at this longtime Midtown triplex, while the lower floors are pretty “generic” and “personality free.” N Tonic East 411 Third Avenue (29th Street); 212-382-1059 The \"solid roof deck\" at this “stylish” Gramercy “mega-bar” boasts views of the Empire State Building; the crowd is “young”, and the decibels “loud.” O 230 Fifth 230 Fifth Avenue (between 26th and 27th Streets); 212-725-4300 This “sprawling”, vaguely “tropical” deck crowning a Chelsea office building is “swamped” with “suity” “mingling singles” marveling at the “awesome cityscape” vistas and disregarding the “snooty service” and “steep” tabs; the upstairs “top-of-the-world” scene is the “only place to be during the summer.” P Mad 46 45 E. 45th Street (between Madison and Vanderbilt); 212-725-4300 The latest arrival in the burgeoning rooftop-bar genre, this new Midtown nest is perched on top of the Roosevelt Hotel near Grand Central Station; look for a block-long, runway-narrow space featuring western skyline views, waitresses in itty-bitty black dresses and the usual pricey specialty cocktails and snacks. Q Eden 268 W. 47th Street (Eighth Avenue and Broadway); 212-398-2188 Further evidence of the Theater District’s nightlife renaissance, this revamped rooftop (formerly known as Jade Terrace) may lack sweeping city vistas, but its open-to-the-sky atrium design does offer ample drinking-by-starlight opportunities; it’s already an after-work destination thanks to some hard-working party promoters.

Laurent Tourondel has expanded his empire again. Today he opened a Vegas outpost of BLT Burger, which first debuted in New York. Patties are a combination of Black Angus sirloin, short rib, chuck and brisket, and come with a variety of toppings (or, most notably, topless – \"The Stripper\" lacks a bun). With eight varieties of fries and onion rings, cocktails with names like The Showgirl and spiked milk shakes, it seems like a safe bet that Sin City will find this luxe burger joint “money” (3400 Las Vegas Blvd. S., Las Vegas; 702-792-7888).

Country, Geoffrey Zakarian’s New American in the Carlton Hotel, is going to be a bit more bovine come fall. The restaurant's upstairs dining room, home of its multicourse tasting menu, is shutting down July 4th for a summer hiatus. When the dining room reopens in October it'll have its own name, Country Steak – and the steakhouse chops to back it up. As with Country's other side-operation, Café at Country, chef Willis Loughhead will be overseeing the food. Meanwhile, Gramercy Park has a few other steak options to hold over hungry carnivores till the fall.

Eat to the Beat: Dining Options for Outdoor Summer Concerts

Summer's definitely in high gear, and so is the season's annual glut of outdoor music shows. With so many musical options to choose from, one hardly has time to find a place to eat before the concert. To ease your preshow munchies, we've pulled together a few spots to try, from the very cheap to the very expensive, near four of the bigger outdoor venues. Where do you eat before free music? Let us know on the Zagat Discussion boards! Summerstage: For a cheap bite before a show at Central Park, you can grab a sandwich at the ever-reliable Lenny's or get a cup of soup at Hale & Hearty (if it's not too sweltering). But if you're looking for swank dining, there's always over-the-top French dinner at Daniel. For something in between, stop by Arabelle for its prix fixe. McCarren Pool: Before or after a concert at this Williamsburg venue, nearby fuel-up options include modern Vietnamese spot Silent H and Mediterranean newcomer Lokal. Or, if you want an experience from another era, dig into hearty Italian fare at 108-year-old staple Bamonte's. Celebrate Brooklyn!: As the name suggests, when going to an outdoor concert in Prospect Park, one should celebrate the borough they are in. And what better way to do that than with a classic New York slice at Joe's? For a less-traditional slice, there's always Two Boots. If pizza isn't your thing, a good midpriced option is the Peruvian mainstay Coco Roco; service can be leisurely, though, so plan accordingly. Finally, for farm-fresh bites before you tromp through the park, it's hard to go wrong with Rose Water. River to River: This arts extravaganza encompasses a wide swath of Lower Manhattan that's chock-full of dining options, including the delicious cheese steaks at Carl's Steaks and the stupendous views at Liberty View. For something that's a little more Zen, there are rolls aplenty at Battery Park newcomer Kaijou. Or just blow what's left of your expense account, if you have one, at MarkJoseph Steakhouse.

The line at the last New Amsterdam Market in December. photo: Robin Riley Lower Manhattan doesn't want for much these days, but a good outdoor market would be nice. A group called the New Amsterdam Public has begun hosting market events in front of the old Fulton Fish Market building with hopes of making it a regular attraction. Last December, despite a snowstorm, their \"Wintermarket\" was attended by over 5,000 people and a number of local chefs. For this summer market, to be held on Sunday, June 29th, the group is hoping to double those numbers. As before, the market's goods will have an emphasis on the sustainable food movement. Everything from regional honey to wild edibles will be available for purchase. And again, local chefs will be showing off their talents. For example, Jim Lahey of the Sullivan Street Bakery has organized a slew of bakers – including Roger Gural and Karen Bomarth of the French Culinary Institute, Peter Endriss of Bouchon and Per Se, Mark Fiorentino of Daniel, Amy Sherber of Amy's Bread and more – to create signature breads for sale. If all goes well, look for more New Amsterdam market days to follow in the coming seasons (11 AM–4 PM; admission is free but there is a $5 suggested donation; located in the plaza fronting the New Market Building on the East River between Beekman Street and Peck Slip).

Now this could be interesting. Eater is reporting that beloved Meatpacking diner Florent isn't closing on Sunday after all. Or rather it will be closing, but then reopening on Tuesday with the same menu, the remaining staff and a new name: R&L. The restaurant will reportedly be run by the building's landlord, Joanne Lucas, who precipitated Florent's closing when the rent was raised to more than $30,000 per month, and whose father used to run a restaurant called R&L in the same space; its sign still hangs above the door. When the Buzz called the restaurant to ask about the rumor, we were told it was closing on Sunday.

Popular Village bar and jazz spot the Zinc Bar is moving, taking over the 82 West Third Street space that formerly housed the Baggot Inn. But the move, which has been previously reported, isn't the only news coming from Alex and Kristina Kossi, the siblings who own Zinc and are partners in the Flatiron Lounge and Pegu Club. Not only will the new Zinc Bar be opening to the public the first week of September (the old space will stay open until the new one is ready), but come November third sibling Kevin Kossi will be opening another bar in the same building, this one a wine bar called Vine Bar. Located upstairs from the new Zinc, in the space where Comedy Village lived before moving to 89 MacDougal Street, the bar will feature mainly Mediterranean wines, cocktails and small plates and sport design by film art director Jan Roelfs (Gattaca, Alexander).

This weekend New Yorkers looking to explore the wonderful world of food have two similar, but oh-so-different, options laid out for them: the Fancy Food Show, running at the Javits Center from June 29th through July 1st, and the UnFancy Food Show, going down at the East River bar in Williamsburg on June 29th only. The more staid Fancy Food Show is, first and foremost, a trade show. As such, it focuses on specialty foods and wines for restaurants, hotels, department stores, supermarkets, mail-order and the like, who make up a majority of its 20,000-odd guests. But that doesn't mean it isn't a great way to sample and learn about interesting products and processes. Meanwhile, the UnFancy Food Show focuses on food stuffs made in less industrial circumstances and in small batches. Products like local honeys, cheeses and beers are the soul of this more lighthearted affair. In the end, both events promise to be entertaining and edifying glimpses into an easily overlooked part of the food industry (Fancy Food Show, Sunday–Monday 10 AM–5 PM, Tuesday 10 AM–4 PM; $35 per person in advance, $60 per person at the door; to register visit www.specialtyfood.com; UnFancy Food Show, Noon–6 PM; $5 suggested donation).

Spilling (and Sphericating) the Secrets of el Bulli

By Karen Hudes, ZAGAT Survey Senior Editor A New Orleans chef turns on, tunes in and goes molecular Mussels within mussels photo: Xavier Laurentino Given the mystique that surrounds chef Ferran Adrià, whose restaurant el Bulli in Roses, Spain, is the mecca of molecular gastronomy, most wouldn’t expect him to share his techniques with the world at large. But he’s actually an open-source kind of cook. Offering the first seminar of its kind, last December Adrià invited a group of U.S. chefs to learn some of his techniques. Chef Xavier Laurentino, owner of Laurentino’s in New Orleans, was among the lucky 10 – including Top Chef runner-up Marcel Vigneron and Scott Boswell (chef-owner of New Orleans’ Stella!) – to attend the three-day demonstration in Barcelona taught by one of el Bulli’s head chefs, Andrés Conde. The Catalan-born Laurentino spoke to the Buzz about those three wild days in the kitchen, giving us a glimpse of a culinary future that goes far beyond foam. ZB: What was the concept of the course? XL: Every season at el Bulli [which is open to the public only from April to September], they create 15–20 new techniques. After the season, they’re intending to get chefs from around the world, show them the products they’ve created – all natural products – and the techniques. It’s like what Pavarotti did with classical music, opened it up for the masses. It goes against what other chefs do. The French would invent something and keep it safe, and only show it to the sous-chef. But this is the policy of the open-door kitchen. A sphericated olive photo: Xavier Laurentino ZB: Describe some of the techniques you learned. XL: The first day we did spherification. Right now I’m working on a kalamata sphere. I get the best kalamatas, the best oil and a little brine, and blend them to death. Then you pass it through a Superbag, a plastic bag with extremely tiny holes. You press very hard to get all the black liquid – the essence of the olive. You add Algin [a product extracted from brown algae] to it and put it into a bath of water with Calcic [a calcium salt]. Then it gels on the outside and becomes a ball with a very thin membrane. It looks like a kalamata olive, but put it in your mouth and as soon as you press it, it explodes with an intensity of flavor that’s 10 times that of a regular kalamata. Baby, you don’t have to chew anything, it hits you like a ton of bricks. We did spherication of yogurt and raspberries, creating a ball within a ball. The flavor of the yogurt was out of this world. We did spherification of a mussel – a transparent ball with a mussel in it. It’s a totally different experience, feels like the sea. They showed us how to create incredible airs [aka foams]: oil airs, kirsch airs, milk air, chocolate air, brandy air. You use Lecite, which enhances the strength of the molecular consistency, so the foam can last three to four minutes. We put airs into the dehydrator and made a Parmesan air like a cookie – unbelievable. We also made spaghetti Parmesan, where you take liquid essence of Parmesan, add a gelling agent and put it inside a plastic tube with small holes at the end, then put that into a bath of water and ice. You blow on one end of the tube with compressed air and perfect spaghetti comes out. It’s all Parmesan, but looks like spaghetti. ZB: How much science was involved? XL: At el Bulli, they look at the chemistry of cooking. You have a [thermostat-regulated machine] that runs water through the system to cook sous vide, so there are no hot spots, no cold spots. You cook lamb chops on it, medium, then take them out, sear really quickly, and you don’t lose the liquid. They lose liquid after 67 degrees – the collagen breaks down. I never heard of that. It’s a new way of looking at cooking. ZB: Did you meet Ferran Adrià? XL: No, next time. He has so many people knocking on his door. I’ve heard he keeps his distance, very cheflike. A chef from el Bulli told me, “I worked there six months before he said hello to me, but he knew my whole story.” ZB: How was dining out in Barcelona? Did you notice any trends? XL: Barcelona is in the middle of a culinary revolution. Over the three days, we went to some of the most incredible restaurants. Inòpia is run by Ferran Adrià’s younger brother, Albert. It’s kick-ass food – new techniques with a traditional flair to it. And El Racó de Can Fabes is doing Catalan cuisine using the most modern techniques. So you can have a degustation menu of 15 different modern creations, or you can have a traditional leg of lamb aromatized with pine needles and cooked on its own juices inside a clay bag that is broken tableside. Because of el Bulli, there’s a new type of restaurant we’ll see emerging in the U.S. They serve most of the dishes bite-size in spoons. A lot of places are doing this – spoon restaurants. Xavier Laurentino (center) with Marcel Vigneron (left) and Gary LaMorte in San Sebastian photo: Courtesy of Xavier Laurentino ZB: Tell me about the other chefs in the class. What was Marcel Vigneron like? He gained a reputation for being arrogant on Top Chef. XL: I can see how he developed that reputation, he has an air about him that might be misunderstood as arrogance. However, my personal experience with him was really positive. I liked his interest in the class, he cooperated with the chef-teacher at all times. He talks, dreams, breathes, thinks and lives food. At the end of the course, I went to San Sebastian with Marcel and Gary [LaMorte, sous-chef at Bouchon in Las Vegas]. We rented a car and went to Navarra, to the village where I grew up. At one restaurant they made a Spanish mountain dish of lamb chops over clippings of grape vines, and a rabbit stew with onions, green peppers, potatoes, olive oil, water and salt and that’s it. The final flavor was incredible. We went from the most advanced to super-traditional. I introduced them to the real deal – it was the experience of a lifetime. ZB: Did you already know Scott Boswell from New Orleans? XL: I’d never met him before. The first day when we were getting to know each other, he said, “After the hurricane…” I said, “You kidding me?” It was love at first sight. We had a great time in Barcelona and now we create things and pass them on to each other. Once a month we go out to a restaurant we don’t know. He started working on a truffle ice cream. Everybody is experimenting. We are all enthralled. We get together and bounce ideas off each other. ZB: What kinds of dishes are you working on now? XL: I’m working with mozzarella and tomato, saving the flavor in a sphere. I’m like a little kid with a chemistry kit. It opens your mind and you start thinking about cooking. I’m working on spaghetti made with Manchego cheese. And I created an incredible tempura with kalamata and Cabrales cheese with Trisol, which keeps it crunchy. I’m in New Orleans, so I’m looking at an oyster on the half shell, very clean with an air of lemon and a little zest. ZB: Do you think this approach to food will catch on in New Orleans? XL: I’m opening a new restaurant Uptown where people want to try new things. In Metairie they’re used to Italian and Creole. They don’t want to know anything about airs. People Uptown, they do. At the new place, which I hope to open by September, I’ll be doing a line of classic Spanish tapas with a subsection of avant-garde dishes for people who want to be on the cutting edge. But it’s hard to market – New Orleans is kind of a traditional place. If you want a paella that blows your lid away, that’s what I’ll keep doing at Laurentino’s. You go “out there” and then back to the basics. I put my food where my mouth is.

To start, you can always stick with the classics and take a trip to Coney Island to watch the annual Nathan's International July Fourth Hot Dog Eating Contest, which kicks off at noon. If competitive eating isn't your thing, consider a festive dinner with a clear view of Macy's 4th of July Fireworks, which will once again shoot above the East River from South Street Seaport and lower Midtown at 9 PM.

South Gate Makes Its Restaurant Week Debut photo: Ryan Charles When your flush friends jet away in late July for a trip to the Hamptons, you’ll have at least one thing to lord over them: they’ll be missing Summer Restaurant Week, when more than 200 New York eateries will be offering three-course meals for lunch ($24.07) and/or dinner ($35). The deals run for two weeks (July 21–25 and July 28–August 1) and participating restaurants include newcomers like Bar Boulud, Wildwood Barbeque and South Gate, as well as tried-and-true classics like Esca and Union Square Cafe. Here are some sample dishes to look forward to: pan-seared wild striped bass with wilted butterhead lettuce, toasted quinoa pilaf and charred red pepper coulis (Patroon); housemade duck prosciutto salad (Fleur de Sel); 16-spice–crusted chicken (Mesa Grill); barbecue-grilled surf 'n' turf (Primehouse New York); and porcini-dusted halibut with wilted baby spinach and tomato couscous (North Square). Reservations at the more popular spots fill up quickly, so check out the full list of participating restaurants here (note that not all restaurants offer both lunch and dinner deals) and then come back to Zagat to read reviews and book your table.

Richard Blais shows off the \"cold fog\" created when you bite into a \"popcornsicle.\" Still smarting that Stephanie Izard beat out Richard Blais and Lisa Fernandes for the title of Top Chef? Why not tell Richard yourself? Next month, during the week of July 14th, the chef is teaming up with Garrett Popcorn Shops to introduce a new treat: the \"frozen popcornsicle.\" Made with caramel- and cheese-flavored popcorn that's been frozen in liquid nitrogen, the new 'sicle claims to produce a \"cold fog\" when it hits your mouth. Blais will be hand to show off his dish – and maybe his smoke-ring skills? – at the popcorn shop's 560 Fifth Avenue location from 11:30 AM–2:30 PM on July 15th, 16th and 17th. Customers who show up for Blais will not only get to meet the former cheftestant but also get a free sample of the popcornsicle as well as a 10% discount off a bag of popcorn.

Designed for busy New Yorkers, the event ends at 8 PM so guests can get home at a reasonable hour (specifically 9 PM). The series kicks off with a performance by Jonah Smith paired with a three-course prix fixe dinner that includes options like lobster bisque, bamboo-steamed shrimp dumplings, soy-lacquered Chilean sea bass, grilled shrimp and scallops, and warm molten chocolate cake, sorbet or crème brulée for dessert.

San Domenico Going Downtown, Adjusting Accordingly

The old Central Park South San Domenico location photo: Courtesy of San Domenico After 20 years of feeding classic Italian fare to \"jackets-only\" clientele on Central Park South, Tony May's San Domenico is going Downtown and freshening up its image. The restaurant, which officially closed last night, is celebrating its last hurrahs today with a final luncheon and an \"alumni dinner\" where former chefs like Scott Conant and Andrew Carmellini are teaming up with current executive chef Odette Fada. The restaurant is then going into a hibernation of sorts as a high-end caterer until its new digs, at 19 East 26th Street, are ready late next spring. San Domenico won't just have a new home next year – it will also have a new name, SD26: San Domenico. Its new space, designed by Massimo Vignelli and architect Daniel Barteluce (neither of which have worked on restaurants before), will be much larger, encompassing two dining levels with an upstairs mezzanine available for private functions, a long black granite bar, a lounge area, a chef's table in the kitchen, a wine tasting room and an open wine cellar. There will even be a small retail area to sell products used in the food. Forgoing the traditional menu, May and Fada plan to have an open-ended menu that will just list the dishes available without forcing them into categories like appetizers or second courses. The dress code will also be lost in the move because, as May explained, \"once you had to wear a jacket and tie in places like this, now we let almost anyone in. As long as they have pants on.\"

Hamptonites looking for serious tasting events have two dates to mark on their calendars. First there's the Great Chefs Dinner to benefit Bridgehampton's The Hayground School on Sunday, July 13th. Living up to its name, it will feature such notable toques as Tom Colicchio, Claudia Fleming, Alfred Portale, Eric Ripert, Laurent Tourondel and Jonathan Waxman. Those who purchase VIP tickets are entitled to a three-course dinner inside East Hampton's Nick & Toni's cooked by Colicchio, Ripert and Fleming; VIPs are also welcome at the tent outside the restaurant, where regular ticket-holders will be enjoying a walk-around tasting. Beyond the delicious food, there will also be fine wines for all, a \"wine genius bar,\" two specialty drink bars and more (6–10 PM; $350 per person; $1,500 for VIP tickets; to reserve, call 631-537-7058 or visit www.greatchefsdinner.com). Two weeks later, on Saturday, July 26th, over 35 top toques will be converging at the James Beard Foundation's annual Chefs and Champagne Gala at Sagaponack's Wölffer Estate Vineyard to celebrate the career of the inimitable Wolfgang Puck. Chefs participating in the summer soiree include Govind Armstrong (LA's Table 8), Anne Burrell (Centro Vinoteca) Harold Dieterle (Perilla), Benjamin Ford (LA's Ford’s Filling Station), Alexandra Guarnaschelli (Butter), Kerry Heffernan (South Gate), Tony Liu (Morandi), Olivier Muller (DB Bistro Moderne), pastry chef Nancy Olson (Gramercy Tavern), Rafael Palomino (Greenwich's Palomino), Joseph Realmuto (Nick & Toni’s), Bill Telepan (Telepan) and Fabio Trabocchi (Fiamma). And if that list of boldface names isn't enough to tempt you, there will also be copious amounts of bubbly pouring from four different champagne houses (5:30–8 PM; $195 for JBF members; $275 for the general public; 139 Sagg Rd., Sagaponack; call 212-627-2308 or visit www.jamesbeard.org to purchase tickets).

With three successful small Italian restaurants around town, chef/owner Salvatore Corea (Bocca, Cacio e Pepe, ex Spiga) is trying something a little different for his latest, Alloro. Corea and his wife, Gina, are bringing to life their dream of opening an \"old-fashioned family-run\" Italian restaurant near their home on the Upper East Side. The new 50-seat restaurant boasts a shimmering black bar and heavy window shutters to balance its green floor and white walls. The full menu follows tradition, with a selection of cheeses and cured meats, pastas, meat and fish dishes and, of course, dessert. The restaurant, whose name means laurel in Italian, plans to open on June 24th (307 E. 77th St.; 212-535-2866).

Making Olive Oil a Cinematic Affair

Harvesting olives for oil in Umbria, from the documentary La Raccolta (The Harvest). photo: courtesy of Donna Lennard You would be hard pressed to find a good kitchen that doesn't have a bottle of olive oil, and yet the process of getting that golden-green grease out of pit-filled olives is still a mystery to many. Enter filmmaker Donna Lennard. Fourteen years ago, she and her partner Alberto Avalle opened an antique shop on Bond Street called Il Buco. They began serving meals to their friends, and quickly realized that folks were just as interested in the food they were serving as the chairs they were selling. The store morphed into a well-regarded restaurant in its own right, but along the way Lennard slowly lost touch with film-making. One day, while sourcing quality products for the restaurant, inspiration struck. The resulting 30-minute documentary, La Raccolta (The Harvest), will have its premiere this Wednesday night at the NYC Food Film Festival at Water Taxi Beach. After years of traveling back and forth between Italy (where Avalle is from), Spain and New York for good food, Lennard became, she says, \"increasingly involved with how these products were made.\" Her interest in the olive oil harvest began \"with stories from my partner about this family [the subjects of the movie] and making olive oil.\" It led to her finally participating in an actual harvest, which became the subject of the film. In fall 2003, Lennard and a friend packed up their cameras and started shooting – La Raccolta is one of only two films in the festival actually shot on film. But using film turned out to have a serious drawback when an airport x-ray destroyed several rolls. Lennard went back for two more harvests to get all of the material needed for the movie. Another few years of editing (with the birth of son somewhere in the middle) and the documentary was at last complete. Focusing mostly on a single family who has been working in Umbria for generations, the movie gives a glimpse into a process that has changed slightly and slowly over the years. The moraiolo, the olive most common to that region of Italy, grows especially close and tightly to the tree, lending itself to hand- rather than machine-picking. Which isn't to say that things haven't changed at all. To get the oil, \"olives used to be ground by a large stone that would move around and around and crush them. Then that paste would be layered on straw, circular mats which were then squeezed together in a pneumatic press. That's the old-fashioned way,\" says Lennard. \"And while some people still do some or all of that process, others have moved onto other methods.\" A newer process uses stainless-steel blades to literally slice the oil out of the olives without heating the oil, which can damage the flavor. As the movie was being made, Lennard and her partner ended up helping another friend build an oil mill in Umbria that uses the newer technology. That oil not only appears in the dishes at Il Buco but is also available for sale at the restaurant. And of course, it will be on hand at the movie's premiere next Wednesday.

Message in a Bottle: Talking Wine With Alice Feiring
***AUTHOR

2009-06-13 00:00:00
***CONTENT
By Randi Gollin The Buzz catches up with Alice Feiring to find out more about her stance on modern-day winemaking and how she manages to find bottles that meet her standards. If you’re ever going to invite Alice Feiring over for dinner, you’d best put some careful thought into the wines you’ll be serving. The Manhattan-based, James Beard Foundation Award–winning journalist may be petite and soft-spoken but she has some very strong oenological opinions, as evidenced by her blog (Veritas in Vino), the articles she writes for publications including The New York Times, The San Francisco Chronicle and Condé Nast Traveler as well as the title of her new book: The Battle for Wine and Love or How I Saved the World from Parkerization. Whether or not you agree that the world needs such saving – the title reflects her belief that too many wines are manipulated through technological means, often with the aim of winning high ratings from influential wine critic Robert M. Parker, Jr. – the book offers some provocative reading. It’s a memoir-esque account of her visits to various independent and big-name wine producers interwoven with personal vignettes about romance and friendship. Zagat Buzz caught up with Feiring recently – over lattes, we should add – to find out more about her stance on modern-day winemaking and how she manages to find bottles that meet her standards. Zagat Buzz: What drove you to write this book? And what prompted The Battle for Wine and Love part of the title? Alice Feiring: I was furious about what was going on in the wine world. I felt that by writing this book I was doing what I possibly could to make it easier for me to go and get something to drink. What love has to do with it, there is of course my love of wine, but also, I started the journey when my 11-year relationship broke up and it seemed to be an interesting parallel. ZB: What made you so furious? AF: The decisions by marketing teams to make wine towards a certain taste. Marketing teams mostly started taking over the role of the winemaker, and saying we want this kind of wine so it gets this kind of score. So whether there was a marketing team, or a winemaker who wanted to attract a certain critic, they would all use technology to push wine into a certain flavor profile. So wines no longer reflected the place or the vintage they came from. ZB: So you felt wine no longer reflected the terroir. AF: Terroir is the synergy of place, climate and soil, winemaker, when it all comes together. You can’t take the winemaker out of that equation for me, but he or she is just one of the elements. It used to be there were centuries in Europe of planting a certain vine that is suited for a certain kind of soil. In new-world winemaking you basically put in anything you want in any kind of soil and deal with the taste later. The emphasis is on the fruitiness as opposed to the grape transporting the DNA of that area. ZB: Is the use of technology more of a new-world phenomenon? AF: It is a new-world phenomenon that is used all over the old world at this point. You basically can say, I want this Albarino grape to taste like Sauvignon Blanc, so I’m going to use the Sauvignon Blanc yeast and I’m going to make it taste really grassy. There are enzymes that affect the color. Then there’s the reverse osmosis machine, which deconstructs the alcohol from the wine, then you can reconstruct it, as you see fit. There are added tannins. There’s a whole slew of flavoring and aroma shapers. ZB: So you would define Parkerization as...? AF: Big, big wine! … Parkerization would be what is considered by the general public to be a good wine. If it is a red wine, something with a very dark color, very thick, full-bodied wine that maybe has a taste and aroma of vanilla, cherry and maybe espresso. Basically, if somebody gets a light-bodied wine they say this is thin and they can’t judge it as an interesting wine. Delicacy in wine has absolutely no cachet; it has no value in the wine world anymore. And not every wine can be full-bodied, and isn’t … Also, a big wine in white: a big, oily, kind of viscous white wine. ZB: So why does the world need saving from Parkerization? AF: Besides the fact that I want something to drink, I want people to know that what every winemaker will tell you – that my wine is made in the vineyard – is absolutely not true. Most wines are made in the winery. And I think that once the public knows that, it will change their whole attitude and they may be curious, well, what is natural wine? ZB: Can you pinpoint a region that makes what you call ‘real,' ‘authentic’ wine? AF: Right now there is a revolution going on in France in winemaking, with a very strong vin naturel movement. There are brilliant young winemakers all over the country and that word is finally spreading now to Italy, certainly in Germany and Austria – they’ve always been slightly influenced by it – but it is mostly France. And if I am pinpointing regions, the Jura and Arbois. But also the Loire – the Loire probably has one of the greatest concentrations of great natural winemakers. ZB: What would you define as real wine or authentic wine or traditional wine – are they all the same thing? AF: Well, as I found out by the end of the book, using ‘traditional’ when it comes to wine is a dangerous term. There are a lot of bad things that were done in the name of ‘tradition.’ ‘Authentic’ wine is something that I like to use and the definition would be a wine from a very talented winemaker, because like I said you cannot take the winemaker out of the equation. But where no technique or ingredient is imposed on the wine to profoundly affect its flavor, texture, aroma, and so you do your good vineyard work, you farm as authentically as possible without the use of chemicals. You have choices about how you want to ferment, but if fermentation takes off naturally you don’t inoculate for malolactic. You basically don’t use any flavoring device on the wine. It’s what people expect wine to be but don’t know that it’s not. If the wine is a pale color you let it be a pale color. You don’t use enzymes to beef it up. ZB: How – and where – do you find wines that you like? Give us some recommendations to seek out. AF: New York City is blessed with great wine stores like Astor Wines and Chambers Street Wines. These days I’m drinking lots of wines from the Loire made from Gamay, Cabernet Franc and Chenin Blanc as well as lesser known grapes. In the summer Muscadet is always refreshing. Some producers I love are Chateau De Coulaine, Catherine et Pierre Breton and Clos Roche Blanche. ZB: How do you navigate wine lists in restaurants? AF: That’s a tricky question. Personally I navigate first by my budget and then assess the options. If a wine list is unfamiliar to you, I can probably suggest getting the cheapest Côtes du Rhône available. This is more often than not a safe bet. Also, another tip if the territory is unfamiliar is to ask the sommelier the importer of the wine. If it’s Neal Rosenthal, Louis/Dressner, Jenny & François, Kermit Lynch or Polaner it’s probably worth taking a chance on. ZB: What does the future hold? AF: I think we’re on the brink of an extremely exciting time in winemaking where paradigms are going to bust. Winemakers heretofore who have been afraid of doing natural wine are going to embrace it. And regions will find their real voice.

The Top Chef Season Four finale judges photo: Courtesy of Bravo TV On last night's season finale of Bravo's Top Chef, the final three cheftestants Lisa Fernandes, Richard Blais and Stephanie Izard went head-to-head in Puerto Rico, where they each cooked four dishes for a bevy of judges consisting not only of Tom Colicchio, Gail Simmons, Padma Lakshmi and Ted Allen but also chefs Alfredo Ayala, Dan Barber, April Bloomfield, Eric Ripert and our very own Tim Zagat. To find out what really went on down in San Juan, we grabbed our boss for five minutes between his meetings. Zagat Buzz: So, how was it filming the finale of Top Chef? Tim Zagat: The whole thing was really exciting. I hadn't been to Puerto Rico for a while and I couldn't believe how much nicer San Juan was. The [taping] was done in the Governor's mansion in Puerto Rico, but the whole area including downtown San Juan is just really beautiful now. Clean, beautiful and charming. But very hot. Luckily the competitors were all very good. The thing that they were being asked to do is tougher than anybody normally does in the restaurant industry. You don't do the whole meal by yourself in a restaurant. Essentially, each one of them was doing four dishes, on their own, top to bottom and in the end the food turned out pretty good. And there were some individual dishes that were really exciting. ZB: Which was your favorite dish? TZ: Well they had this black rice [Lisa's dessert of black Thai rice with caramelized coconut, mango cream and crispy taro] which I thought was amazing. There was also a creamy soup [Lisa's tom ka soup] that was just fabulous. And Richard's first course was a scallop that I would be pleased to find in any restaurant. ZB: And what was your least favorite thing that you ate? TZ: There were a few dishes that didn't really work, that had too many flavors in them or were too complex. I've always believed that half of great cooking is simplicity. If you have a beautiful piece of fish or meat, you don't really have to do much with them. On the other hand, bad ingredients need great chefs to overcome them. ZB: How much of the final decision were you and your fellow guest judges privy to? TZ: I knew what people liked. It was very clear. Most of the time we liked the same things. What was interesting was that at different times different chefs were really shining. After the first round, we thought that one chef had it in the bag. And then in the next round there was another chef that we all liked. And so it looked like it was down to two chefs. And then in the third round, the third chef knocked it out of the ballpark. At the end of that course, I couldn't have told you who was going to be the winner. And then we had dessert and that black rice dessert was just sensational. I would love to see that being served in any restaurant. [Mai House, where Lisa currently works, has not yet decided if they will serve the dish.] But for doing that much on their own, they all did well. You have to remember they were working very late in hot weather. They were working very hard and dinner didn't even wrap up until nearly 10 PM. I felt particularly for Richard, who I thought was a very talented chef. If you looked at him at the end of the meal, he looked like someone had gone and hit him on the back of the neck. Up to that point he had been just cheerful, fun, bright, upbeat and outgoing. So for him to come into the finale and do as much as he did and then feel that he hadn't lived up to his abilities was a shame. ZB: Any other observations on your meal? TZ: The chefs who were on with me [Ayala, Barber, Bloomfield, Colicchio, Ripert] were all very articulate and impressive. What they reflect is what is happening in the world of chefdom. Chefs truly have become celebrities in their own right. It would be harder to find a brighter or nicer group of people. Spending several hours with them talking about food couldn't have been more fun. Before he could reveal any more, Tim's assistant whisked him away from us and onto his next meeting.

The Top Chef season four finale will air tomorrow night, and picking a winner sure wasn’t easy, Ted Allen told the Buzz at the James Beard Foundation awards. \"This year, for the first time when we chose the winner, Tom [Colicchio] suggested as a part of making the decision we do some numerical models. It did help.” Part of the difficulty, he explained, was the quality of the chefs. \"The level of competition is so high, the judges have to split hairs,\" Allen said, giving the dismissal of Antonia for under-cooked peas in the last episode as an example. If the judges can’t decide, they can always turn to ZAGAT.com users. When asked in our online poll who should win, 55% of voters chose Stephanie, followed by 40% who chose Richard. Lisa, the dark-horse candidate, received only four percent of the vote.

Last year's NYC Food Film Festival If ever there were a marriage of two topics we could get behind, it has to be food and film. So we're looking forward to the Second Annual NYC Food Film Festival at the Water Taxi Beach in Long Island City. Running from Saturday, June 14th to Friday, June 20th, the fest not only gives visitors the chance to see a slew of short films about food and the people who grow and produce it, but also lets them taste the good stuff too. Film topics range from an Umbrian olive harvest (La Raccolta, directed by il Buco owner Donna Lennard) to BBQ joints in Alabama (Holy Smoke Over Birmingham). On Tuesday, June 17th, the festival takes a quick detour off the beach to screen three short pizza films in the parking lot next to Grimaldi's in Dumbo. Film awards – including Audience Choice – will be given out on June 20th (screenings start rain or shine at 8:30 PM daily, for a full schedule go to www.nycfoodfilmfestival.com/schedule.html; films are free to the public, food is not).

Friendly Competition: David Chang (Momofuku Ssäm Bar) beat out his friend Wylie Dufresne (WD-50) for the Best Chef in New York City award. photo: Christina Livadiotis View Slideshow Last night at Lincoln Center, the spotlight was on the food greats who gathered for the James Beard Foundation Awards. Big winners included Joseph Bastianich and Mario Batali for Best Restaurateur, Gramercy Tavern for Outstanding Restaurant and Momofuku's David Chang for Best Chef: New York City. Perhaps the greatest triumph of the night was Chicago's Grant Achatz, who not that long ago had defeated the cancer that threatened his life as well as his taste buds, winning the award for Outstanding Chef. The three-hour awards ceremony was followed by a walk-around tasting with an \"artisanal America\" theme – not to mention raucous after-parties. If you missed the affair (which was open to the public), check out The Buzz's photo coverage here. – Liz Borod Wright

An open bar will be available until 9 PM, and there will be a foodie-focused auction and a performance by Afro-pop star Kaïssa (7 PM–midnight; $75 per person or $100 for two tickets bought online; 877-777-1420, ext 136).

As we mentioned a while back, this weekend Madison Square Park again plays host to one of the bigger food events in our fair city. No, not the James Beard Awards – those are being held uptown later in the evening. We're talking about the Sixth Annual Big Apple Barbecue Block Party that will take place from noon–6 PM on Saturday and Sunday, June 7th–8th. Featuring more than a dozen pitmasters from around the country, the event is free to the public to walk around, though plates piled high with 'cue will still cost $8 a pop (sides and desserts are $4, drinks run $2–6). And it won't just be about eating barbecue – the organizers have also rounded up two days worth of free lectures and demos to keep your mind full as well. If you plan on attending, be prepared to buy a lot of Snapple (the event's sponsor) or pack some bottled water before you leave home: The event is expected to draw over 100,000 people during what is being forecast as the first heat wave of the summer. Fine by us since heat waves are, after all, the perfect barbecue weather.

The Odeon's new ice cream cart New York dining just keeps getting more and more street savvy. And it isn't just stand-alone operations like the Dessert Truck anymore. Hot on the heels of word that Shake Shack will be sending a burger truck out to the wilds of Brooklyn, TriBeCa trailblazer Odeon has joined the fray with its own spin on things: an old-school ice cream cart. For the rest of the summer, hot pedestrians in Lower Manhattan can mozy on up to the restaurant's famous fluorescent sign for a quick cone of house-made ice cream – the cones are being made in-house too. The cart will stock vanilla, chocolate and a rotating cast of flavors depending on what's available at the markets. The Odeon plans to keep the cart out seven days a week, rain or shine, from 1 PM to dusk.

Ever wanted to have an iced beverage named after you? Now is your chance. To kick off its First Annual Iced Tea Festival, on June 2nd SoHo tea haven Sanctuary T will be letting customers create their own special iced tea using the restaurant's many special blends. The winner of the competition will not only have their iced tea named after them and added to the summer menu, but they will be entitled to drink their eponymous tea for free all summer long (6 PM; $20 per person, all proceeds go to City Harvest). But the festival, which runs June 2nd–8th, won't just be about making iced tea. It will also be about drinking it. Each day, the restaurant will have five iced different blends to try, including a lime-mandarin green tea spritzer, cinnamon-chile iced tea, watermelon lemonade and the classic Southern \"sweet\" tea. The beverages will be virgin during the the day, but once the sun sets, the drinks will slip into the notoriously liquor-soaked history of iced tea with some harder blends (212-941-7832).

Among the great culinary treats of the city are the green markets that open up all over town once the weather permits. Not only do the markets in Union Square and Grand Army Plaza provide fresh fruits, vegetables and plants for urban dwellers but they also keep the city's restaurants' pantries stocked. So who better to walk a budding gourmand through the ins and outs of the green market than the city's chefs? Find out for yourself this summer when the Council on the Environment of New York City invites seven top toques to walk hungry shoppers through the process of purchasing and making a fresh meal from the market. The fun starts on Wednesday, June 25th, when Savoy chef Peter Hoffman will meet patrons at 10 AM in Union Square, lead them through the green market and then bring them back to his restaurant for a lunch \"inspired by freshness.\" Other chefs lined up for the year are Colin Alevras of The Tasting Room (July 16 at Union Square; 4–8 PM), Alex Guarnaschelli of Butter (August 20 at Union Square; 10:30 AM–2:30 PM), Saul Bolton of Saul (September 13 at Grand Army Plaza; 10:30 AM–2:30 PM), Bill Telepan of Telepan (September 20 at Union Square; 10:30 AM–2:30 PM), Galen Zamarra of Mas (October 8 at Union Square; 10 AM–2 PM), and chef Marcellus Coleman and owner John Tucker of Rose Water (October 18 at Grand Army Plaza; 12:30–4 PM). Menus will be determined by what's available at the market ($125 per person; space is very limited, to make a reservation call 212-341-2258 or visit www.cenyc.org/greenmarket/cheftoursandtastes).

But that's not all that's new in Park Slope. The neighborhood has seen a slew of recent arrivals worth a visit: Aperitivo Barrio Eurotrip Ghenet

While at Tao, chef Hazen helped bring the restaurant to its current position as one of the highest grossing venues in the nation – Tao Las Vegas had more than $66 million in sales in 2007, according to the trade mag Restaurants & Institutions. Hazen is leaving Tao to focus on his consulting business, and his position has been filled internally by chef Ralph Scamardella, who was previously the executive chef at Tao New York.

Ask Zagat: Why Is Escargot Day May 24?

***CONTENT
To celebrate National Escargot Day, One if by Land, Two if by Sea is serving a special menu topped off with a special dessert: a meringue piped in the shape of a snail, served with licorice ice cream and mint granite. photo: courtesy of One if by Land, Two if by Sea Arguably one of the lesser food holidays, May 24th is National Escargot Day, a day when gourmands are invited to sup on and celebrate the lowly gastropod. But why does it take place at the end of May? The same reason that Thanksgiving is celebrated in November: The harvest. Of the thousands of varieties of gastropods that slowly crawl around the planet, only a little more than 100 of them are edible, and a mere two – the helix pomatia and the helix aspersa – are popular among diners. Of those, most of the pomatia snails sold commercially come from public land in Burgundy, France, and are harvested in May according to Potironne's snail distributor Doug \"the Snailman\" Dussault. And so National Escargot Day, the exact origin of which is up in the air, lands conveniently as the springtime harvest wraps up and makes its way down the supply chain. But first the snails must be prepared for travel. After the annual harvest, snails are cooked for two-and-a-half hours to destroy any parasites, and then canned for distribution. \"Snails are never served fresh, they are always frozen or canned,\" explains Craig Hopson, chef at One if by Land, Two if by Sea. Though canned snails are ready to roll from the get-go, most chefs prefer to cook them further before serving. Traditionally, in the old French brasserie restaurants, says Hopson, chefs would remove the snail and then it put back in the shell with snail-flavored butter and bake it in the oven. While that method is still beloved by many, more and more toques are losing the shells altogether. For his special Escargot Day menu, all of Hopson's gastropods have been de-shelled. But snails can and should be celebrated all the time. The tiny treats – edible snails are between the size of a dime and a half-dollar – are relatively eco-friendly compared to most other meats in this day and age. A wild animal with a controlled harvest, the snail is in many ways, according to Dussault, the perfect protein: \"They are sustainable, have no methane emission, no processing... all the things people worry about.” Do you have a dining question you'd like answered?

My Night in Hell's Kitchen

***CONTENT
Now that I've been a guest critic on Gordon Ramsay's show Hell's Kitchen (episode 408, which aired on Tuesday, May 20th), people keep asking me exactly where Hell's Kitchen is. I like to tell them that it's somewhere between guilt and redemption – an answer that earns me a blank stare and, in one notable case, the perfect follow-up question: \"Is that in Las Vegas?\" No, it's actually on a sound stage in the warehouse district that sits more or less between the westside of LA and the airport. It's an impressive structure, with a leitmotif of flames gushing from behind every logo and, it would seem, every visible orifice. But mostly, the flames are in the kitchen – some from the stovetops, but most from Gordon Ramsay. So, there I was in October on the set, invited to be a critic along with Sophie Gayot. The Red and Blue teams prepared hotellike food – and often not quite that – in their respective kitchens. There were medallions of beef, slightly overcooked, and salmon filets, not quite as overcooked. The food all came out very slowly. But the food wasn't the point. Ramsay's antics were the point. He would bound into one of the kitchens, scream at the chefs for a spell, throw their food on the floor or in the sink, then head to the other kitchen to do it all over again. It was like watching a soccer match, only instead of a ball, there was fish and meat. Then came Ramsay's meltdown. He banged his head against the oven, then ordered the Red team out of the kitchen. The Red Team had completely fallen apart – much of their food never arrived and subsequently they lost the challenge to the better-prepared Blue team. But the Blue team lost a fingertip – Matt sliced his off. His flesh probably wound up in the pancetta that garnished the salad. The show was edited so that I appeared to be chewing on the fingertip, and praising it for its texture. Yum. Just call me Hannibal Shindler. – Merrill Shindler

Salon de Ning photo: The Peninsula New York Highbar photo: Ryan Charles It's tough to be stuck in the city for Memorial Day weekend when it feels like everyone else is skipping town. But if you check out these two hot new rooftop bars, you can log in some quality outdoor time and have something to brag about to your friends when they return. An opulent reworking of the Peninsula Hotel’s former Pen-Top bar, ritzy rooftop Salon de Ning offers inspiring Midtown views from its two outdoor terraces and glass-enclosed bar, now redone with a new ‘Shanghai deco’ look (think lacquered screens and Chinese daybeds); of course, sky-high tabs come with the lofty territory (700 Fifth Ave., 23rd fl.; 212-956-1300). Hell’s Kitchen’s latest rooftop (debuting tomorrow), Highbar, a sleek double-decker, is a Jetsons-meets-George-of-the-Jungle hybrid that mixes bamboo shoots, tropical plants and drop-dead Hudson River views with a media wall and a ‘UFO chair’; the venue will also include a glass-walled, air-conditioned lounge for indoor types and a downstairs den for VIPs (251 W. 48th St., 16th fl.; 212-956-1300).

Hot Blocks: Meatpacking District

***CONTENT
By Randi Gollin Not only has the Meatpacking District still got it, but the shopping's better than ever. Here's our short list (and a map) of stores, bars, restaurants and hotels. The too-cool-for-school crowd may scoff that the once-stealth Meatpacking District has lost its achingly hip luster, morphing into a nocturnal playground for tourists and the bridge-and-tunnel crowd. And in some cases, like the imminent closing of pioneering French diner Florent, they may be right. But the influx of new hot spots like Bagatelle, Merkato 55, Kiss & Fly and Tenjune show that these cobblestone streets hold a charisma that won't quit, and the popularity of evergreens like Lotus, Pastis and Spice Market hints that the glitterati and night owls probably never left. Chances are that forthcoming attractions like the High Line Park and a satellite branch of the Whitney Museum of Art, plus the Standard Hotel, will further ramp up the MPD's buzz factor. While the still-gritty Meatpacking District may lack SoHo's bustle and breadth, it remains a must-shop destination for fashionistas drawn to luxe labels with edge. Much like Jeffrey, Alexander McQueen, Stella McCartney and other early arrivals, many of the latest retailers traffic in exclusivity – or, at the very least, require major bucks to burn – and despite the economy, seem to be going like gangbusters. So whether you want to play dress-up, sip, snack, pose and/or shake your moneymaker, the Meatpacking District offers countless possibilities. Here's a short list (and a map) of spanking new shops and a selective sampling of hangouts. (Note: We've also included a few soon-to-open places for future reference.)

photo: collinox May 24th is National Escargot Day, a perfect opportunity for snail aficionados to come out of their shells. From May 21st–24th, One if by Land, Two if by Sea will be serving a six-course escargot menu – including dessert – featuring Wild Burgundies, considered the Kobe beef of snails ($85 per person; $135 with wine pairings; 212-228-0822). On the other hand, if you’re the kind of person who thinks of snails merely as garden pests, no worries – chef Craig Hopson has added some new dishes to the regular à la carte menu that may be more up your alley, including sepia a la plancha (grilled cuttlefish) with pineapple, Thai basil and pink peppercorn salad, and rouget steamed in seaweed with crushed cherry tomatoes, fennel ravioli and cepes.

The Battle of the Wolfgangs

***CONTENT
A bi-coastal battle is brewing in the City of Angels. Earlier this month, Wolfgang's Steakhouse, the New York mini-chain from Wolfgang Zwiener (former head waiter at Peter Luger), opened its doors in LA, where there has recently been a slew of new steakhouses. And today the new chophouse has found itself in embroiled in a lawsuit with none other than Wolfgang Puck. Wolfgang's Steakhouse first LA outpost (and first location outside NYC) is just around the corner from Puck's Cut steakhouse, and Mr. Puck, needless to say, is not amused. According to a lawsuit filed in LA Superior Court today, Wolfgang Puck is claiming that not only has Wolfgang Zwiener gone back on a 2007 agreemement between the two parties but has also purposely emphasized the name Wolfgang in order to \"take unfair advantage of the reputation and enormous good will developed\" by Puck over his decades of working in the City of Angels. The earlier agreement reportedly said that if Zwiener were to expand outside of Manhattan he \"would use his full name 'Wolfgang Zwiener' in a manner which would eliminate confusion regarding any affiliation\" between the two Wolfgangs. The full name of Zwiener's steakhouse is, technically, Wolfgang's Steakhouse by Wolfgang Zwiener. But the steakhouse has not, according to Puck, been forthcoming to patrons about its full name or its non-relationship with the famous chef. \"I have one lady who books her Christmas party every year with us and always tries to book it in our new restaurants, like Cut,\" Puck says. \"So she called the steakhouse thinking it was mine and tried to book it. When she asked to speak to a manager, nobody would tell her it wasn't my restaurant. They kept it, somehow, very vague.\" Even the valet at Spago has been confused, Puck adds. He recently congratulated the chef on his new steakhouse. This all could be resolved quite easily, according to Puck: \"I would just like them to use their full name. I would use my full name if it were me. If they are running a good operation and call it Wolfgang Zwiener, what difference would it make?\" When the LA restaurant's signage first appeared, Puck says his people approached the steakhouse to remind them of their agreement, but it \"fell on deaf ears.\" And so Puck has thrown up his hands and is now in it for the long haul. \"We'll do whatever it takes now,\" he said. \"If it goes for a year, it goes for a year.\" Reps from Zwiener could not be reached for comment.

New York's street festival season has begun in earnest (one of the many reasons for the bad Manhattan traffic this past weekend). While in recent years, many street fairs have become odd clones of each other with similar foods and vendors, there are still a few legitimately unique ones like this weekend's 32nd Annual Ukrainian Festival on Seventh Street between Second and Third Avenues. A quirky reminder of some of the East Village's denizens before the dorms took over, the Ukrainian Festival, sponsored by Seventh Street's St. George Church, features piles of authentic Ukrainian cuisine like handmade pierogies, blintzes, shashlyk (Ukrainian shish-kebabs) and more. There are also stands devoted to crafts including embroidery, nesting dolls and, of course, painted eggs. Culture buffs will want to check out the relatively new Ukrainian Museum on Sixth Street, which will be open all weekend, as well as the enthusiastic dance performance that's a part of the festival each year (May 18, 4–11 PM; May 19, 11 AM–11 PM; May 20, 1–5 PM).

Cabrito photo: Evan Miller Josh DeChellis’ short-lived Villager BarFry has undergone a quick makeover and reemerged as Cabrito, a casual cantina that's already luring crowds with its tequila-based cocktails and affordably priced tacos, cemitas (sandwiches), namesake slow-roasted goat and other rib-sticking Mexicana; it inhabits a snug tile-and-stucco interior with a lengthy bar as its focus, but in warmer months the back patio is also an option. 50 Carmine St.; 212-929-5050 See More New Restaurants Around New York City

Coming Soon: Hundred Acres

***CONTENT
After a year of trying to make their vision of the 20-year-old SoHo French restaurant Provence work out, owners Vicki Freeman and Marc Meyer (the folks behind Cookshop and Five Points) threw in the towel last month and decided to take the space in a whole new direction. The fruit of their labor, a farm-friendly New American called Hundred Acres (an homage to an old nickname of \"Hell's Hundred Acres\" for the area South of Houston Street), is set to open by May 19th. The decor has been transformed – the bar area has been tiled to evoke an \"old-time butcher shop\" and other rooms have been designed to feel like a contemporary farmhouse. But don't worry, old architectural favorites like the skylit back room remain. Joel Hough, currently the chef de cuisine at Cookshop, will join chef Marc Meyer in running the kitchen (38 Macdougal Street; 212-475-7500).

***CONTENT
After two years serving of its Kyoto-style kaiseki dinners as prix fixe–only for $105–150, TriBeCa's Rosanjin is shaking things up. For diners who don't want to commit to the fixed price meal, the jewel-box of a restaurant is now offering an à la carte menu featuring many of the items that appear in the prix fixe. Diners can choose from appetizers like seared-scallop-and-seaweed salad ($9), soft abalone served with sea urchin ($30) and pork kakuni in soy-based soup ($18) and entrees such as roast duck ($18) and lobster gusokuni ($37). Those who are really feeling extravagant can opt for the Japanese beef steak for $135.

***CONTENT
The new mac 'n cheese at Spitzer's has duck cracklings on top. Lower East Side gastropub Spitzer's Corner has completed a whole new menu, which had been a work-in-progress over the past two months. Consulting chef Wayne Nish (of the late Nish and March) and chef de cuisine Sung Park have dropped everything from the original menu – except the homemade pickles ($4) and the short rib burger ($10) – and added a slew of filling new dishes to keep Spitzer's late-night drinkers from getting too tipsy. New items available include \"French kisses\" of prunes filled with foie gras mousse ($10), duck-fat potato cakes ($6), tomato salad with watermelon-chile dressing ($9), mac 'n' cheese with duck cracklings ($9), sweetbread po boys ($15) and a kobe beef burger ($16). Nish and Park have also revamped the restaurant's brunch menu (available after 11 AM on Saturday and Sundays), turning it into a classic brunch menu with the likes of eggs Benedict ($12), French toast ($12) and three eggs any style ($7).

Ask Zagat: Where's My Spoon?

2009-05-09 00:00:00
***CONTENT
Restaurants often will leave the spoon out of standard place settings. Diners have started noticing something missing from their place settings: spoons. As TerrenceS74908 recently posted on our discussion boards, \"Unless I ordered coffee, or later, a dessert that required one, spoons seem to be missing from place settings.\" So where did all the spoons go? In our quest to find out, the Buzz got in touch with one restaurateur who goes the spoonless route: Marc Murphy (Landmarc, Ditch Plains). \"It just seems to clutter up the table,\" he told us, \"and not everybody needs a spoon. When we send the soup out, a spoon comes out on the liner under the dish. And, honestly, when I go to one of those fancy restaurants with all that silverware, I just push it aside – I need my room. I don’t know, I just like it to be a bit cleaner and neater.\" A distaste for clutter seems a reasonable enough reason to drop a utensil, but we wondered if there was something more to the spoonless trend. And it turns out there is, according to Dr. Brian Wansink, the director of Cornell's Food and Brand Lab who's currently on leave to run the Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion, in Washington, DC. Wansink said that his team at Cornell learned that \"while place settings don't seem to have much of an effect on the way people order it definitely changes how people perceive a restaurant.\" They conducted a study of business diners \"who don't blink at spending $30 on an entree,\" in which they asked participants to look at dozens of different settings and rate them by features like how expensive that restaurant would be. \"Settings without spoons were seen as more 'European' and were rated as slightly more elegant than most settings that had spoons,\" Wansink said. However, the spoonless settings did not take top honors in the study. That distinction went to the very traditional setting of two forks and two knives on either side of the plate with a soup spoon across the top. Do you have a dining question you'd like answered?

Jonathan Burrows, creator and owner of LA's Mr. Cecil's California Ribs, called me recently, bubbling with excitement to report that he was going to be part of the Sixth Annual Big Apple Barbecue Block Party in New York City. Held on June 7th and 8th from noon–6 PM in Madison Square Park, the event sells plates of what it calls \"the country's best barbecue\" for $8 apiece. Mr. Cecil is the only invitee from California – and one of only a few from the west. And they're there with some major players – among them, Big Bob Gibson Bar-B-Q from Decatur, AL, Mitchell's BBQ from Wilson, NC and Salt Lick from Driftwood, TX. Burrows points out that the event is the same weekend as the James Beard Awards. Which means when the tuxedoed swells grow weary of tuna tartar and seared foie gras, they can head on downtown to eat some real food. Real food with real people – what a concept! – Merrill Shindler

Tavern on the Green... in San Francisco

What do you think of a Tavern on the Green that's not actually on the green? Can the famous NYC landmark be replicated in SF? Share your opinions on the Zagat Discussion boards! Tavern on the Green, which happens to be the second highest grossing independent restaurant in the nation, is opening a second location. The San Francisco Business Times breaks the story that the restaurant, famous for its spectacular decor and unique location inside Central Park, is planning to open an outpost atop the troubled Metreon shopping center in Yerba Buena. The San Francisco Tavern on the Green – which at 40,000 sq. ft. including a 13,000-sq.-ft. terrace will be the city's largest dining venue by far – will reportedly sport opulent decor similar to its older sibling's. To make use of all that space, the restaurant, which will have Brian Young (former chef de cuisine at Le Bernardin) running the kitchen, will cater to large groups and parties – especially from nearby hotels and the Moscone convention center – when it opens in summer 2009.

Rounding Up the Bowery

***CONTENT
The outdoor seating on First Street at the Bowery Wine Company. photo: Evan Miller Going to drink on the Bowery sure doesn't mean what it used to. Not so long ago, it was a ragtag strip of flophouses and kitchen supply stores. Now it's on the cusp of becoming a full-blown scene with an astonishing 15 nightspots on a six-block stretch of the Bowery lying between East Fourth and Spring streets. In just the past two months the once-gritty thoroughfare has seen the opening of a John Varvatos store in the old CBGB's space, a fancy coffee shop, three galleries and five new nightspots (Antik, Bowery Electric, Bowery Wine Company, Kings Cross and a relocated Mannahatta) in the shadow of the still-chic, year-old Bowery Hotel on Third Street. And, there would have been a sixth nightlife newcomer if the East Village Yacht Club hadn't sailed away before it even moved past the opening-party stage. (Not that the space will be empty for long, as the Buzz has heard that the old Kelley and Peng is being prepared for use in an upcoming NBC reality cooking show called The Chopping Block with British chef Marco Pierre White hosting. Neither the production company or the landlord could be reached for comment.) The details on the nightspots mentioned above, from north to south, after the jump: With no sign on the door and late-night hours, Antik, the new velvet-roped lounge in the former Marion’s Marquee digs, brings the Meatpacking District to the Bowery with the standard chandelier-banquette-votive decor, bordello-ed up with retro flocked wallpaper and crimson lights; there’s no visible bar – waitresses fetch your cocktails from behind a black curtain – and as there are only eight tables, reservations are suggested (356 Bowery; 212-388-1655). Hidden in a cellar below Antik, Kings Cross, a signless new British pub, looks much the same as it did during its earlier incarnations as M&R Bar and the Slide; it’s still a long, narrow space with a rec-room vibe and draws a correspondingly unpretentious crowd (356 Bowery; 212-388-1655). Annexing the former Remote Lounge space, Bowery Electric, the new rock bar from the Hi-Fi folks, plays it cool with a midnight blue palette, trendy Edison light bulbs and a banquette-lined back lounge; it feels like it belongs in a stylish boutique hotel (327 Bowery; 212-228-0228). Mannahatta, one of the Bowery’s largest nightspots, has relocated down the street into the former Crime Scene digs and downsized itself in the process; its new, brick-lined home feels more like a saloon than a salon, with a standard-issue front barroom opening onto a cozy rear lounge (310 Bowery; 212-477-1979). Located in a new luxury tower just off the Bowery, the Bowery Wine Company echoes its rapidly gentrifying neighborhood with upscale airs, offering an airy, somewhat sterile interior that plays second fiddle to swell outdoor courtyard seats; expect a reasonably priced vino list and the usual small-plates accompaniments (11 E. First St.; 212-614-0800).

Shochu: Raising That Old Asian Spirit
***AUTHOR
BuzzEditor
***DATE
2009-04-28 00:00:00
***CONTENT
By Troy Segal, ZAGAT.com staff editor Seeking something stronger than sake, but subtler than scotch? Try a sip of shochu. Shochu Lynne Wallack and John Handler, owners of Chicago’s popular Deleece, were ready to launch a second restaurant. Rather than just doing Deleece Part Deux, however, they “wanted it to be something unique, something innovative, that would also be popular,” Wallack recalls. Then her executive chef Josh Hansen came across an ancient Japanese distilled spirit, and the more they researched it, the more intrigued they became. “We stumbled on a great beverage – really smooth-tasting, with less alcohol, fewer calories [than American liquor] and even health benefits – and everything spiraled from there,” says Wallack. Designed around their discovery, the new venture opened last Wednesday, April 23rd. Set in a contemporary storefront room complete with a fireplace, this American take on a Japanese izakaya serves Eclectic small plates, sushi and 20 varieties of the drink it’s named for: Shochu. While Wallack and Handler’s concept for an “American Shochu Lounge” may be new, shochu itself – along with its Korean cousin soju – has been around for a while (references date back to the 1300s). It’s even been around here for a while, mostly in Japanese or Korean restaurants, some grand and some surprisingly humble. In California and New York, a loophole in the liquor laws has allowed eateries with only beer/wine licenses to serve a spirit labeled “soju,” as long as it’s no more than 24% alcohol (about 48 proof). Shochu – Good For You? In Japan, shochu sales are booming, surpassing even that of sake. One reason for its popularity, some surmise, has to do with health. Shochu contains about one-third the calories of other liquors and less alcohol (usually 50 proof); because of that, and the purity of its ingredients, some imbibers claim it causes less of a hangover. There may be other medical benefits: 10 years ago, a Japanese medical researcher published a paper claiming that shochu activates enzymes that inhibit the growth of blood clots, thus helping to prevent strokes, heart attacks and other thrombosis-related ills. But what really sold shochu as a health drink was an item in the 2002 Guinness Book of World Records saying that the then-oldest man in the world had consumed a few ounces of the stuff every day for the last 50 years of his 120-year-old life (he lived on an island off Kyushu, Japan’s premier shochu-producing region). Actually, his doctor advised against it, but the lifelong farmer – who had sworn off smoking and rarely ate meat – claimed he would rather die than give up his beloved beverage. But around 2004, coming off an explosion in popularity in Japan (and, no doubt, noting America’s culinary craze for all things Asian), producers and distributors began stepping up shochu exports, especially of the good stuff – and to push these smoother, artisanal varieties as a premium liquor. “About three to five years ago, we began to heavily promote shochu and its various ingredients,” says Ami Nakanishi, assistant manager of business planning for New York Mutual Trading, which distributes 35 brands (up from three when the company started, back in the ’90s). While practically any starchy substance can be used – there are versions composed from sugar cane, carrots, buckwheat, green tea and tapioca – shochu is typically made of rice, barley or (the current favorite) sweet potatoes, or a combination thereof. But more significant, as far as aficionados are concerned, is the way the spirit is distilled: continuous or multi-pot vs. the artisanal single-pot. Most common is kourui, the result of the continuous distilling process; often compared to vodka, this sort is milder, both in alcoholic content – generally 48–72 proof – and in aroma. Almost all the Korean soju available here is this type, which is why some prefer it for cocktails: “It’s less bitter, cleaner and smoother – so smooth it immediately takes on the flavor of any juice or fruit,” explains Danny Lee, manager of Washington, DC’s Mandu restaurant where, he adds, specialty “sojutinis are killing all the other drinks” on the full bar menu. Historically older, but newer to these shores, is otsurui or honkaku shochu, which goes through a single-pot distilling process; the result is a stronger (50 to 90 proof) drink, with a more distinctive flavor of the main ingredient. If kourui is akin to vodka, honkaku often “has the same characteristics that single-malt scotches do,” notes Rick Smith, owner of Sakaya, a New York City liquor store devoted entirely to sake and shochu. Like single malts, these shochus are best savored straight, on the rocks or with hot water (60% shochu, 40% water is the traditional way, though a 50-50 split works if the shochu – and the drinker – are strong). In a recent poll on ZAGAT.com, 70% of surveyors said that they’d never tried the colorless spirit – but would be glad to give it a whirl. Where to find some shochu near you? Although trendy bars and lounges are beginning to stock it, interested imbibers should also check out Korean barbecue or Japanese izakaya-style restaurants. Traditionally, shochu has been drunk with food, “but not serious food” – more like noodles or other nibbles you’d find at publike places, says Masaharu Morimoto, whose namesake restaurants in New York and Philadelphia have recently introduced a proprietary label. While he doesn’t indulge much now, back in his youth he put away his share of shochu, the Iron Chef recalls – his preferred tipple being the sweet potato–based type. And his favorite now? “My brand, naturally.” Here are some restaurants and lounges in New York that offer a selection of shochu or soju: Blue Ribbon Sushi Bar & Grill (new Columbus Circle branch ONLY) Decibel EN Japanese Brasserie Kyotofu Sakagura Yakitori Totto

Anchors Away: The East Village Yacht Club Sails Past the Bowery

A little more than two months after leaving its old dock on First Street, the East Village Yacht Club is back out on the high seas. Initially it appeared that the Club had found a safe harbor in the old Kelley & Peng digs at 325 Bowery (no, Peng isn't a typo, its sibling restaurant on Greene Street was the only real Kelley & Ping). But despite a few private parties and some early press, the club is shoving off once again. According to Eat Rice's Brad Kelley, who owns the building, a new lease is about to be signed with a different tenant. \"The East Village Yacht Club is going to sail away,\" he said. Kelley wouldn't divulge why the Club couldn't anchor on the Bowery or who would be taking over that space. Reps from the Yacht Club couldn't be reached.

Opening day at the new Brooklyn Flea Photo: food_in_mouth While stoop sales sometimes do the trick, dumpster diving makes for good sport and eBay scratches the itch 24/7, when it comes to finding truly unique stuff at a price that you can cart home guilt-free, there’s nothin’ like a merch-packed flea market. No wonder bargain-hunters borough-wide and beyond are packing into Brooklyn Flea, Fort Greene’s new outdoor bazaar from the owners of Brownstoner.com. Held rain or shine on Sundays from 10 AM–5 PM at the Bishop Loughlin Memorial High School, this flea is quickly becoming the place to be (Lafayette Ave. between Clermont and Vanderbilt Aves.). After riffling through records, memorabilia, midcentury pottery, new lighting, vintage clothing, crafts, jewelry, lotions, potions, knickknacks and other oddities from the rotating roster of 200 vendors covering the school lot, a treasure-hunter can work up quite an appetite. Stave off hunger with a cupcake from one of the on-site bakeries while browsing, then take your portable bibelots to brunch at one of these spots, all located within a few blocks from the Flea.

The Shake Shack Photo: Noah Kalina Those desperate for a late night Shackburger at the Shake Shack can rejoice. According to the eternally long-lined Madison Square restaurant its extended hours are back, starting today. You can now stuff yourself silly at Danny Meyer's burger joint in the park seven days a week from 11 AM–11 PM until the end of the summer, using the regular line or the just re-opened \"B-Line\" (where you can only buy frozen custard, drinks and Shack clothing). Bonus: Today the Shack is celebrating its new hours with $3 Brooklyn Pilsner all day long, a special cherry cobbler–flavored concrete, and live music from 7–9 PM.

Wildwood Barbeque sports a rustic/industrial look. photo: Wildwood Barbeque B.R. Guest – the restaurant group behind Blue Water Grill, Dos Caminos, Ruby Foo's and several more popular places – branches out to yet another cuisine with Wildwood Barbeque. Set to debut tomorrow in spacious Flatiron digs that manage to be both rustic and industrial-chic thanks to accents of reclaimed timber and blackened steel, this saucy newcomer doesn't limit itself to one type of 'cue but instead borrows the best techniques from each region. BBQ fans should be pleased enough that \"Big Lou\" Elrose, who hails from Hill Country, is the pit master that they'll be willing to overlook that there's vegetarian chili with smoked tofu on the menu – hey, it's New York. 225 Park Ave. So.; 212-533-2500 Discover More New Restaurants Around New York

Alain Ducasse Brings Benoit to NYC

Benoit photo: Ryan Charles Fifty-fifth Street just got its second Alain Ducasse eatery; modeled after the original Paris location, Benoit, which opened today, is just west of Adour in terms of location and south of it in terms of menu prices (which still require deep pockets). Housed in the space of the now-defunct La Côte Basque, this stunning bistro retained its predecessor's charming sconces while lightening up the room by covering the walls with blonde oak and hanging large photos of Paris; the black-and-white tones of the bar area, which will have a separate light menu as well as a list of champagne cocktails, are brightened by a colorful mural on the ceiling taken from an old French bakery. N.B. Bring a date, because on its classic menu, some of the dishes like roast chicken and the tarte Tatin are for two. 60 W. 55th St.; 646-943-7373 Benoit photo: Ryan Charles

The Chicken, the Fish, and the King Crab photo: courtesy the TriBeCa Film Festival Sure, you may pair your wine or beer to match your meal, but what about your movie? In honor of the 7th Annual Tribeca Film Festival – which kicks off on the evening of April 23rd and runs until May 4th – the Buzz has created a food-and-film pairing menu. Here's our detailed itinerary: one film, paired with one restaurant, for each day of the Downtown film fest. Thursday, April 24: Quiet Chaos and Grimaldi's 6:00 PM at Pace University (3 Spruce St.) The Film: Quiet Chaos (112 min.), which is based on Sandro Veonesi’s 2007 novel, centers around an Italian TV exec dealing with his wife’s unexpected death. The Restaurant: Since the Pace University theater is located right near the entrance to the Brooklyn Bridge, take advantage of the springtime weather and walk over to Grimaldi’s – open until 10:45 PM – located in DUMBO right under the bridge (19 Old Fulton St., Brooklyn; 718-858-4300). Friday, April 25: Three Kingdoms and Peking Duck House 8:30 PM at Pace University (3 Spruce St.) The Film: In the epic Three Kingdoms: Resurrection of the Dragon (101 min.), starring Andy Lau and Maggie Q, three ancient Chinese kingdoms battle for control of the country. The Restaurant: Before catching this action flick, grab an early dinner at Peking Duck House (28 Mott St.; 212-227-1810), one of the closer Chinatown restaurants. Saturday, April 26: The Chicken, the Fish, and the King Crab and La Paella 5:30 PM at AMC Village VII Theater 3 (66 Third Ave.) The Film: The Chicken, the Fish, and the King Crab (86 min.) chronicles Spanish chef Jesus Almagro’s attempt at the Bocuse d’Or cooking competition. This food doc’s title refers to the three required ingredients in the 2006 competition. The Restaurant: After watching nearly an hour-and-a-half of cooking on the big screen, you’re bound to crave some Spanish cuisine. Try La Paella – which is open until midnight – located a few blocks away from the East Village theater (214 E. Ninth St.; 212-598-4321). Sunday, April 27: Zen of Bobby V and Hasaki 12:00 PM at AMC Village VII Theater 3 (66 Third Ave.) The Film: The doc Zen of Bobby V (93 min.) shows how baseball manager Bobby Valentine brought America’s pastime to Japan. The Restaurant: After this Sunday afternoon showing, head over to the cozy East Village sushi house Hasaki for a late Japanese lunch (210 E. Ninth St.; 212-473-3327). Monday, April 28: Secret of the Grain and Fleur de Sel 9:00 PM at AMC 19th St. East Theater 2 (890 Broadway) The Film: In Secret of the Grain (151 min.), a North African family relocates to the south of France. The Restaurant: Before heading to the Monday night showing, transport your taste buds with some French cuisine at the nearby Fleur de Sel (5 E. 20th St.; 212-460-9100). Tuesday, April 29: Playing and Samba-Lé 6:00 PM at AMC Village VII Theater 4 (66 Third Ave.) The Film: Actresses reenact ordinary women’s personal tales in the Brazilian film Playing (104 min.). The Restaurant: Samba-Lé may be a bit of a walk from the theater (it’s slim pickings for Brazilian chow in this area of Manhattan) but this lively tapas spot is open until midnight on Tuesday – so there's no rush (23 Avenue A; 212-529-2919). Wednesday, April 30: Portrait of Diego and Mexicana Mama 8:00 PM at AMC Village VII Theater 6 (66 Third Ave.) The Film: Portrait of Diego (79 min.), a documentary about Mexican artist Diego Rivera, has been 50 years in the making; work on this film began in the 1950s but stopped after the death of one of the filmmakers. The resulting film features old black-and-white clips as well as more current footage. The Restaurant: After this film, head over to Mexicana Mama (47 E. 12th St.; 212-253-7594) in Greenwich Village for some Mexican fare with \"nuevo twists\". Thursday, May 1: Fighter and Bereket 4:45 PM at Village East Cinema 2 (189 Second Ave.) The Film: In the drama Fighter (100 min.), a female Turkish high-schooler aspires to become a kung fu master when it's expected she'll study to be a doctor. The Restaurant: Make the walk downtown to Bereket, a spartan 24/7 Turkish joint, for a quick bite after the film (187 E. Houston St.; 212-475-7700). Friday, May 2: Before the Rains and Haveli 7:30 PM at AMC Village VII Theater 1 (66 Third Ave.) The Film: Before the Rains (98 min.) is a 1930s period piece set in Southern India; the title of the film refers to the country’s monsoons. The Restaurant: To partake in some Indian cuisine after the movie, head over to the East Village’s Haveli, which stays open until midnight (100 Second Ave.; 212-982-0533). Saturday, May 3: Hidden in Plain Sight and Saigon Grill 11:15 PM at Village East Cinema 3 (189 Second Ave.) The Film: The film Hidden in Plain Sight (62 min.) explores urban life in four cities, including Ho Chi Minh. The Restaurant: For a late Vietnamese dinner before the film, try the Greenwich Village branch of Saigon Grill, which is just a few blocks from the theater (91-93 University Pl.; 212-982-3691). Sunday, May 4: A President to Remember and the Comfort Diner 1:45 PM at AMC 19th St East Theater 3 (890 Broadway) The Film: The documentary A President to Remember: In the Company of John F. Kennedy (85 min.) looks back at JFK’s presidency from 1961–1963. The Restaurant: For Sunday brunch before the doc, head back in time by going to the 1950s-themed Comfort Diner (25 W. 23rd St.; 212-741-1010). – Emily Hirsch

On Saturday, May 17th, see what the Triangle Below Canal Street has to offer at the 14th annual Taste of TriBeCa, at which over 40 restaurants, including Bouley, Capsouto Frères, The Harrison, The Odeon and more, will be offering samples to raise money for arts education at the local public schools, PS 150 and 234.

Gail Schoenberg, who does PR for the restaurant, nipped a springtime-shuttering rumor in the bud with this email: \"Before rumors start flying, please be aware that this afternoon, a careless individual was smoking next door or above bar Q and started a fire in the atrium. So, bar Q is temporarily closed for this evening.\" She promised to keep us posted with any further information.

Restaurant deals are increasingly turning into a go-to fund-raising opportunity for local charities. The annual Staten Island's Dine Out Against Hunger event tomorrow, April 17th, is a perfect example of this. Over 120 island restaurants, including Bocelli, Lorenzo's and many more, are participating this year by donating 20% of all breakfast, lunch and dinner proceeds to Project Hospitality, a Staten Island–based interfaith organization devoted to helping the hungry, homeless and those suffering from HIV/AIDS. All you have to do to help out is show up at a participating restaurant, eat well and pay your bill. Click here for a full list of restaurants.

Il Buco is getting into Earth Day in a big way. Il Buco, the Bond Street antiques-store-turned-Italian-dining-destination, is proud of its decade-long history of sourcing local and sustainable food, but in honor of Earth Day (April 22nd) it will take its environmental efforts one step further. From April 22nd–27th, the restaurant will donate 100% of the proceeds from its prix fixe lunch to Al Gore's new We Campaign to help halt global warming. In case you're wondering what's on the menu, it's black-kale salad in anchovy vinaigrette, choice of slow-roasted pig panino with wild-fennel pollen or the daily pasta special, and the much-loved panna cotta for dessert ($30 per person; 212-533-1932).

While attention does get paid to the growing ranks of professional female chefs, the restaurant kitchen is by no means the only place where women are increasingly taking charge. To highlight another area, executive chef Patricia Williams and general manager Marissa Barr of District host a monthly series about female winemakers called Girls on Grapes. Guests at this monthly event enjoy wine made by female winemakers, along with small plates from chef Williams. The next event in the series takes place on Friday, April 18th, and focuses on six Chilean wines, three red and three white (6–10 PM; $35 per person; 212-485-2999; reservations are required).

Ask Zagat: Why Is Kosher Wine Different From All Other Wines?

***CONTENT
photo: RaeA At Passover seders from April 19th–27th, many who don't keep kosher will drink kosher wine in honor of the holiday. While Manischewitz (which is made with Concord grapes and, to compensate for the grape’s acidic taste, lots of sugar) is one of the biggest names in kosher wine, there are now many more types out there. With that in mind, the Buzz asked Tom Geniesse, founder of Bottlerocket Wines in New York City, to explain why kosher wine is different from all other wines. “A wine is kosher if all the people who handle the wine from the vineyards all the way through the bottling process are Sabbath-observant,” Geniesse says. Therefore, in order for a rabbi to bless the final product, every detail in the wine-making process – down to the soap used to wash the vats – must comply with kosher law. But not all kosher wines are created equal. There are two types of kosher wines: Mevushal (which means “to boil” in Hebrew) and non-Mevushal. Years ago, in order to make Mevushal wines, wine makers “would literally boil the wine, totally destroy it, and make it horrible,” Geniesse says. “But now they use modern flash pasteurization.” Different rules apply to these two categories of kosher vinos. If a wine is “non-Mevushal, which means non-cooked,” Geniesse says, “then once it’s opened, if a non-Jew were to touch the bottle or serve someone a glass, it’s rendered non-kosher.” With Meshuval wine, like the traditional Manischewitz, people of any religion can handle it. So before you resign yourself to the thought of drinking not-so-stellar wine at this year’s seder, remember that there are lots of high-quality kosher wines. According to Geniesse, an interest in kosher wine “popped in a big way” in the 1980s and now top-notch producers, especially in California and Israel, are showcasing Passover-friendly vinos. As long as the wine-making process complies with kosher laws, any winery can produce a kosher wine. “There are good wines and bad wines of all kinds,” Geniesse says. “Because a kosher wine is kosher doesn’t mean it isn’t a world-class wine.” If you are unsure of which kosher wine will best suit your tastes, ask your local wine store clerk for guidance. Many urban wine stores create kosher wine sections in preparation for the holiday. – Emily Hirsch

photo: Ohad Ben-Yoseph Passover, which celebrates the Jewish exodus from Egypt, starts at sundown on April 19th and continues for the next eight days. And though most will prepare their seders at home with family, there's no reason that the holiday should be that different from all other nights. Why struggle with traditional recipes when so many restaurants around the city are willing to do the work for you? Some Jewish restaurants, like the 2nd Avenue Deli and Rectangles, will be closed, but many others are hosting seders on the first and second nights (April 19th and 20th) or adding special Passover dishes to their menu. Abigael's On Broadway: Jeffrey Nathan's Garment District kosher restaurant will be hosting prix fixe seders on the first and second nights; it's also selling seders-to-go (8:30 PM; $117 per person; reservation form available here). Capsouto Frères: This TriBeCan French bistro continues its long tradition of offering authentic first- and second-night seders complete from the cantor down to the haroset. While not cheap, all proceeds go to American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee (6:30 PM; $150 minimum per seat; 212-966-4900). Friedman's Delicatessen: Cater your at-home seder with selections from this Chelsea Market newcomer; you can also take advantage of the dine-in prix fixe during the eight days, but since there's no liquor license, you'll probably want to BYOKW – Bring Your Own Kosher Wine ($25 per person; 212-929-7100). Katz's Delicatessen: Though there won't be any seder services, copious special Passover dishes will be available at the Lower East Side's last great deli. Prime Grill: This Midtown kosher steakhouse is offering first- and-second night seders consisting of four courses and four glasses of wine for both private parties and the general population (8:30 PM on April 19th, 8:45 PM on April 20th; $158 per adult; $76 per child; 212-692-9292). Sammy's Roumanian: This long-standing Lower East Side spot continues its Passover tradition this year with two first- and-second night seders that include a 20-minute Haggadah (prayer book) reading, loads of traditional food and drink and continuous live entertainment. It's best to make a reservation soon, as it's almost entirely booked up (5 PM & 8:30 PM on April 19th, 4:30 PM & 7:45 PM on April 20th; $190 per person; 212-673-0330). Solo: While this sibling to the Prime Grill isn't offering seders for passover, the glatt kosher spot – which currently has last season's Top Chef winner Hung Huynh as its executive chef – will serve a special Passover menu from Sunday, April 20th–Thursday, April 24th, as it's closed on Friday and Saturday nights (212-833-7800). Tabla: Floyd Cardoz brings a \"New Indian\" approach to the holiday for the third annual \"unleavened Bread Bar\" second-night seder service at the Madison Square Park standout. Ranging from matzo with mango chutney to Goan-spiced brisket to matzo-crust cheesecake, this six-course seder certainly won't be like your bubbe's (7 PM; $95 per adult; $50 per child under 12; 212-889-0667). Toloache: This Hell's Kitchen Mexican restaurant will serve special Passover-inspired dishes like Mexican matzo ball soup ($8), roasted halibut with cauliflower-potato pancake ($27) and tacos de brisket made with matzo tortillas ($9) for all eight days of the holiday (212-581-1818).

The popular Hell's Kitchen Greek eatery Uncle Nick's is planning to launch a new branch in the second week of May at the corner of 29th Street and Eighth Avenue, right near the Fashion Institute of Technology. The new branch will be Uncle Nick's second attempt at expansion. The 17-year-old restaurant previously had a sibling in Manhattan from '97–'98 at 569 Hudson St. in the West Village. That space became Philip Marie, now in its 10th year of operation. And the location of the new Uncle Nick's branch has its own storied past. It was from 1974–2006 the site of a local institution: the now defunct old-school Spanish restaurant Estoril Sol (382 Eighth Ave.; 212-609-0500).

Brasserie Cognac's profiteroles photo: Alessandra Rotondi Brasserie Cognac, the latest from the Serafina folks (there's even a location right across the street), will open officially on Monday, with its \"boulangerie\" – a take-out area with a separate entrance selling pastries, breads, sandwiches, quiche and rotisserie chicken – opening a few days later. (Cognac was supposed to open tomorrow but one of the pipes carrying Coke to the bar burst, raining soda all over.) While the interior is brand-new, it's authentic brasserie: think mirrors, pressed-tin ceiling, dark-wood paneling and flooring. There are two bars, one for drinking (with a list of cognac-based cocktails in a nod to the name) and one for cheese and charcuterie.

China Club to Sing Its Last Aria, Reopen as Opera

This weekend marks the end for the old-school (by club standards) China Club. Though it lost some of its luster since moving to Times Square from the Upper West Side in 1998, the 47th Street mainstay still managed to consistently attract a crowd. Nevertheless, business is business. So China Club's owners will shut its doors Friday night and reopen them on Saturday as Opera, with a new look for the dance floor. Meanwhile, its Jade Terrace is also being retired and renovated, and will reopen with a new yet-to-be-decided name once the weather gets nicer (268 W. 47th St.; 212-398-3800).

Excuse Me, Waiter, There's a Flower in My Salad

In honor of the Macy's Flower Show in NYC, Macy’s Cellar Bar and Grill is serving a Flower Show Salad. photo: Patina Restaurant Group Just in time for spring, edible flowers are sprouting up in restaurants all over the country. You'll find flowers in the house salad at Meadowood, The Grill in Napa Valley and in the squash blossom soup at Rainbow Lodge in Houston. White citrus coriander flowers are blended with wasabi and truffles for an almaco jack appetizer at Vernona in Sarasota, FL, and hibiscus is used in the syrup and as a garnish for seared scallops at Palisade in Seattle. Chef Will Artley, who has used nasturtiums with his rockfish, is looking for ways to incorporate pansies and Sweet Williams into his New American cuisine at Evening Star Cafe in Alexandria, VA. Over in London, fancy Chinese Kai Mayfair offers a special springtime three-course edible flower menu. Have you ever wondered which kinds of flowers are safe to eat and how they taste? Primroses, violets, roses, lavender, day lilies and many more are all consumable. According to Kathy Brown, owner of The Manor House Garden located 50 miles outside of London and author of The Edible Flower Garden, these blossoms taste just the way you’d think they would. \"Imagine the scent of the most perfumed rose – that’s what rose sorbet or rose butter icing on a cake taste like. Imagine the pungent glorious smell of lavender – that’s the flavor of lavender jelly or lavender-chicken casserole,\" Brown said. The more heavily scented the flower, the more flavorful it tends be, but even then it’s unlikely it will overpower the dish. In fact, many edible flowers, such as hollyhock, have very little flavor. Ultimately, edible flowers aren’t about adding seasoning or flavor; they’re used to add color, texture and personality to a dish, according to Brown. \"They quite literally transform a meal,” Brown says. Lilacs and marigolds add splashes of vibrant color while primroses and day lilies add distinctive texture (smoothness and crunchiness respectively). Floral enthusiasts, take heed: there’s no way to determine whether or not a flower can be eaten just by looking at it. Consult guides, like Brown’s book, for a list of permissible flowers. And, Brown, warns, never eat store-purchased flowers because they could be doused in various chemicals. Eat only restaurant-prepared edible flowers or, if you’re feeling horticultural, flowers you have grown yourself. People with springtime allergies may be nervous about consuming flowers, but they probably have little reason to worry. That's because most are allergic to tree pollen not flowers, according to Dr. William Reisacher, an ear, nose and throat specialist at New York-Presbyterian Hospital/Weill Cornell Medical Center. You may not want to go overboard with the edible blooms the first time you try them since you don't know if you'll have a reaction. Keep your allergy in the back of your mind and, as Dr. Reisacher says, “be cautious.” – Emily Hirsch

With African cuisines and Brooklyn both gaining prominence in the culinary scene of late, it comes as no surprise that an old standard like NoLita's cozy Ethiopian Ghenet would look to capitalize on the trend. And so after 10 years of serving up its traditional injera bread on Mulberry Street, the restaurant is readying to debut its second location, this time in Park Slope. The new space, at 348 Douglass St. between 4th and 5th Avenues, should open by April 15th (718-230-4476).

Earlier this week, the Buzz took a look at the process that goes into branding a restaurant by focusing on the work of one New York graphic designer, Louise Fili. But new restaurants open literally every day, and many of them put real effort into their logos with great results. This slideshow shows a few recent logos from around the country (and one from London, too) that we found pleasing.

Meet Linda Rizzo, the Discussion Board Poster \"La Linda\"

***CONTENT
Linda Rizzo, aka \"La Linda\" Meet Linda Rizzo, an ever-present voice on our discussion boards. Rizzo, who goes by the moniker La Linda, has contributed over 93 posts, offering advice on New York, Las Vegas and Paris, as well as on dining etiquette. And, when \"La Linda\" needed dining recommendations for her trip to LA, Zagat posters gladly responded. Rizzo, a New York native with a passion for quality food and a knack for picking good restaurants, confesses that she hates to cook and often eats out four nights a week. Luckily, there's no shortage of dining options near her Upper West Side apartment – local favorites include Rain, Pisticci and Max SoHa. “You find a couple of places you really love in your neighborhood and become a regular there,” says Rizzo of New Yorkers, who she says tend to dine close to home. “It makes you feel like you are part of a neighborhood.\" Though it’s a tough call, Rizzo says her favorite meal ever was a Thanksgiving dinner at Fresco by Scotto, an Italian in Midtown, with her extended family. A designer of high-end women’s wear by day, Rizzo is tuned into New York City’s music scene by night. You might spot her behind the turntables at the Ding Dong Lounge, a Morningside Heights bar that attracts a mix of locals, Columbia co-eds and punk rockers. When Rizzo travels to Paris for textile trade shows, she says her friends rely on her to make the week's worth of dinner reservations. One Parisian favorite is the atmospheric Café Marly, located at the Louvre. She says she often looks to Zagat’s Paris Restaurants book for advice. “I’m just the one who doesn’t mind doing it, and everybody seems to be happy with my choices,” explains Rizzo. As discussion board users know well, Rizzo eats lots of great meals. But they can't all be winners, and when asked to recall the worst eatery she's ever been to, she doesn't hesitate. One night after a concert, she and her boyfriend stopped by a BBQ joint in Brooklyn whose name she forgot, but whose dirty floors and garbage stench she'll always remember. “It was so bad I called the health department the next day to report them,” she says. – Julie Zeveloff

A Logo Is Worth 1,000 Words

By Garth Johnston, ZAGAT.com staff writer Learn how Louise Fili creates a restaurant's brand from the logo to the bill. Graphic designer Louise Fili helps restaurants refine their identities through typography. Photo: Henry Leutwyler, courtesy of Louise Fili To stand out in any cluttered urban dining landscape, a new restaurant needs more than a talented chef and attractive dining room – it needs an identity. While architectural design firms usually get the lion's share of credit for how a restaurant presents itself, such praise overlooks the work of graphic designers, whose contributions can be just as crucial. A restaurant’s logo helps set the tone of the meal to follow, from the signage outside to the typography on the menu. First impressions are vital in the ultracompetitive restaurant biz, and executing those few letters and occasional graphic just the right way is crucial. (See our slideshow of restaurant logos here.) In the crowded field of talented graphic designers who work with the NYC restaurant industry – firms of note include Mucca (Balthazar, Pastis) and Memo (Pizzeria Mozza, Enoteca San Marco) – Louise Fili stands out. After designing more than 2,000 book covers for Pantheon Books, she formed her own company, Louise Fili LTD., and shifted her focus to restaurants. Her work in the field has garnered three James Beard nominations (two for her work with the late Monzu and Bolivar restaurants and a third for a food book) and can be seen in the logos and menus all over town, including Artisanal, Mermaid Inn, Picholine and Sfoglia. \"My experiences with her have been nothing short of wonderful,” said restaurateur Danny Abrams, who has worked with Fili on The Harrison and Mermaid Inn. “She has a way of thinking about logos and graphics that ties the whole thing together.\" On a recent afternoon in her airy office in the Flatiron district, Fili sat down with the Buzz to explain the process of branding a restaurant. Creating the Logo Designers normally become involved late in a restaurant’s gestation, a month or two before the projected opening night (\"projected\" being the operative word, of course). But occasionally designers get involved as early as the concept stage – before the name is finalized. “Sometimes a restaurateur will ask me ‘can’t you just work around [the lack of a name]?’” laughed Fili. “They just think that they can come up with any name and whatever we do with it can make it good, and pronounceable.” Once Fili gets on board, the first order of business is “a big discussion about the restaurant, what it is, what kind of clientele they expect and what they want the logo to do for them.” The exterior presentation of the logo – aka the signage – can have a major impact on the design. “It can’t be a very long logo if there is a short space for it so we have to take that into consideration very early on,” she added. Strong logos embrace the spirit of a place, and Fili’s are no exception. When Nantucket’s Sfoglia decided to open an outpost on the Upper East Side it turned to Fili to reimagine its brand. She returned with a coat of arms decorated with pasta shapes instead of weapons, held up by two muses, with the names of the restaurant’s two locations on the banner below. Another fun Fili creation is the logo for Steak Frites, which features a cow in a striped shirt and beret who blows a line of smoke around the restaurant’s name. Making the Menu A graphic designer provides restaurants with not only a logo, but also menus, check presenters, wine lists and more. The range of menu types and styles can be dizzying, with variations ranging from a single sheet of paper typed in Microsoft Word to an elaborate bound book created with a professional design program like Adobe InDesign. It’s not merely an aesthetic choice: price variations on paper stock and bindings can add considerably to the bottom line. “Ninety-nine percent of the time we end up going with a sleeve,” said Fili, referring to the clear plastic that contains the piece of paper. “A lot of owners have a preconceived notion that sleeves are down-market, like coffee shops. But they don’t have to be that way.” Durability is also key – because menus are passed between dozens of hands each day, they need to be able to take the wear and tear gracefully, or the restaurant will have to keep ordering – and spending – more. The end product must be flexible enough for frequent updates. “The design is about 1% of my work,” said Fili, “and the rest is figuring out how to do it so it doesn’t get messed up.” A restaurant needs to be able to change its menu on the fly, so designers employ a variety of techniques to facilitate this, from leaving a blank area on the menu to training the front-of-house staff (and sometimes even the chef) to use graphic design programs. To make sure everything runs smoothly, Fili and her assistants generally come in prior to the opening to walk employees through the whole process. And to keep the design from degrading after too many edits, they'll sometimes come back a year or two later to offer a refresher course. Something to Remember the Meal By When it first opened, the Mermaid Inn gave customers their bill in carefully opened and cleaned sardine tins. At the end of the meal, the graphic designer still has the opportunity to make the experience memorable for diners through check presenters and keepsakes. For years, matchbooks have been de rigueur, but in an age of near-universal smoking bans, some restaurants have been complementing them – like La Goulue – or replacing them – like Telepan – with scratchpads. And still others have replaced toothpicks for matchsticks. Charlie Palmer’s Metrazur used to give out luggage tags – fully functional, complete with a string – in place of the usual business card. Designed by Fili, this novelty makes reference to the New American’s location in Grand Central Station. Whimsical check presenters can help take the sting off the bill, but two of Fili’s most adventurous vessels were quickly sabotaged by over-appreciative guests. In a now defunct TriBeCa trattoria called Pace, waiters would bring the check inside elegant Italian paperback novels – only to have the books disappear into customers' pockets one by one. Initially at the original East Village Mermaid Inn, the bill was served in sardine tins that had been painstakingly bent open, scrubbed clean of their sardine odor and brushed with clear nail polish to dull the edges. Unfortunately, the lure of a half-opened can was too much for many customers, and one by one the presenters were ripped open and made unusable. Still others were taken home as souvenirs by guests. \"Who steals a sardine can?\" wonders Mermaid Inn owner Abrams. The restaurant now uses a standard presenter that credit card companies provide free of charge.

Catching up with Daniel Boulud

***CONTENT
Last night, The Buzz got a chance to catch up with Daniel Boulud at the black-tie benefit for the Culinary Insitute of America at NYC's Pier 60. Boulud said he had been in the kitchen at Daniel earlier that day when he got a phone call from his staff at db bistro telling him that Wolfgang Puck was dining there. The friends briefly chatted over the phone and Boulud promised to come to the benefit, at which Puck would receive an Auggie for Chef of the Year. \"I'm here to honor my friend,\" Boulud told us. That wasn't the only thing that brought Boulud out last night – he also has a connection to the incredible Brennan family, who were being inducted (yes, as a family) into the CIA Hall of Fame. The Brennans, who operate 11 popular restaurants, welcomed Boulud and his After Hours television crew into Commander's Palace, their legendary Creole in New Orleans, not too long ago. Look for this episode to air soon on MOJO HD. So what's next for the Lyonnais chef who always seems to have something under his hat? He told us that he's breaking new ground in Canada, but not in francophile Quebec. Nope, Boulud's headed to Vancouver where he'll turn the former Feenie's, a West Side hip joint known for its burgers, into db bistro. And, he's taking over chef Rob Feenie’s Lumière, a fancy French that rated as the Vancouver Survey’s Most Popular. The name will stay the same but Boulud will be overseeing the kitchen. He'll reopen both places in August.

This morning, members of the food media gathered at the James Beard House in the West Village for the announcement of this year's James Beard Award nominees, the group that made the cut from 9,600-plus entries. These awards are the culinary equivalent of the Academy Awards. Yet unlike the Oscars, the public can purchase tickets ($450 per person; $400 for James Beard Foundation members) to the black-tie awards ceremony and gala reception (a walk-around tasting focusing on American artisanal cuisine) that will be held at Lincoln Center's Avery Fisher Hall on the evening of Sunday, June 8th. Award categories vary – Outstanding Restaurant Graphics, anyone? – but the one that captures lots of attention is Outstanding Restaurant. Our surveyors agree that this year's nominees have terrific food, as they all ring with either a 26, 27 or 28 Food rating. Meanwhile, New Yorkers can be proud that two out of the five outstanding restaurant nominees are in NYC. (While we're on the subject of Gotham pride, how about gloating that NYC is the only city to have its own category for best chef, while the rest of the country is divided by region.) Here's the list: Outstanding Restaurant Award Nominees Boulevard, San Francisco; Chef/Owner: Nancy Oakes, Owner: Pat Kuleto Campanile, Los Angeles; Chef/Owner: Mark Peel Gramercy Tavern, NYC; Owner: Danny Meyer Jean Georges, NYC; Chef/Owner: Jean-Georges Vongerichten The Slanted Door, San Francisco; Chef/Owner: Charles Phan For this year's Best New Restaurant nominees, the Big Apple scored one out of five. Two of them (Central Michel Richard and Fearing's at the Ritz-Carlton) made New York Times critic Frank Bruni's list of the most intriguing new restaurants outside New York. And without further ado... Best New Restaurant Award Nominees Anthos, NYC; Chef/Owner: Michael Psilakis, Owner: Donatella Arpaia Central Michel Richard, Washington, DC; Chef/Owner: Michel Richard Fearing's at the Ritz-Carlton, Dallas; Chef/Owner: Dean Fearing Osteria Mozza, Los Angeles; Chef: Matt Molina, Owners: Nancy Silverton, Mario Batali, Joseph Bastianich Osteria, Philadelphia; Chef/Owners: Marc Vetri, Jeff Michaud, Owner: Jeff Benjamin To see the nominees in every category, go here.

Sure, everyone loves to hear about hot new restaurants, but equally intriguing are sleepers – those lesser-known gems that folks in-the-know like to keep to themselves in order to keep the crowds at bay. Whether it’s a cozy little corner, an out-of-the-way swingin’ spot or just a friendly place with fantastic food, the sleepers on the following list can help rouse you out of the dining doldrums. Tides is a real secret. photo: Noah Kalina Brown Café 61 Hester St.; 212-477-2427 When you need a break from the always-trendy metropolis that is New York City, this unpretentious little LES American will put its arm around your shoulder and make you feel at home.

Ichimura 1026 Second Ave.; 212-369-6300 The high-quality sushi at this calming haven from the bustle of Midtown will make you forget about that unimportant detail called the bill. La Cantina Toscana 1109 First Ave.; 212-754-5454 Specializing in homemade pasta and wild game dishes, this East Side Italian turns First Avenue into Tuscany. Tides 102 Norfolk St.; 212-254-8855 Look up at the “sea grass” ceiling (made of bamboo stalks), then look down and dig into the likes of lobster rolls at this Lower East Side seafooder. – Jeff Freier

Get ready, amateur mixologists. On March 27th, Muse Hotel is hosting a mixology competition/fund-raiser to benefit Dress for Success, a nonprofit that gives disadvantaged women professional attire they can wear to work. Anyone interested in showing off their creative bartending skills can participate in groups as large as five. After paying a $100 entrance fee, each group will receive five drink tickets for themselves and a box of mystery spirits and mixers from Diageo. Thirty minutes will be allotted to each team to concoct their drink, which will be voted on by the party's attendees. The winning team will receive a private cocktail party for 10 at the Silverleaf Tavern, which will also serve the winning drink for the month of April. And, the evening won't just be about the booze. Patricia Williams, chef at the hotel's District restaurant, will also be on hand providing tasty treats, plus there will also be a clothing auction with items available from brands like David Yurman, Carolee and Gap (6 PM; 130 W. 46th St.; $15 per person, includes one drink; for information regarding team entry forms, contact Ilana Alperstein at 212-982-8300 x103).

Though many of the special Easter meals around town are booked up, there is still space at these spots: Commerce: This West Village newcomer will be opening its doors early for the holiday.

Dos Caminos: All three locations of this high-end Mexican mini-chain will be serving special dishes for the holiday, including a bittersweet-chocolate egg filled with white-chocolate mousse and Cajeta served over shredded phyllo ($10). Lunetta: At the new Manhattan outpost of this Brooklyn Italian, chef Adam Shepard will be offering a five-course \"Pasqua Supper\" including braised rabbit and leg of lamb (3–10 PM; $55 per person; 212-533-3663). Osteria Del Circo: The Midtown Tuscan will be serving an elaborate four-course tasting menu for Easter including black-kale-and-ricotta gnocchi, salted codfish with tomato-bread soup and more (1–9 PM; $75 per person; $105 with wine pairing; 212-265-3636). Strip House: There will be special Easter items on the menu at this Greenwich Village steakhouse including a grilled asparagus salad ($15), roast loin of lamb with mint cous cous ($39) and strawberry-rhubarb tart ($12) to go along with the restaurant's usual beef (212-328-0000).

Freshly picked tea in a basket. photo: Courtesy of Sanctuary T Considering the importance of tea in American history – the Boston Tea Party, anyone? – most folks don't really know that much about how the stuff gets from the ground into the teacup. Dawn Cameron, of SoHo's Sanctuary T, wants to change that. Having just returned from a tea-gathering trip to Sri Lanka, Cameron is launching a monthly tasting and talk called the Sri Lanka Limited at her New American restaurant on April 1st. Each month, Cameron and her peers will not only talk about the different varieties and methods of tea harvesting in various regions but also offer attendees a chance to actually smell and taste the leaves being discussed. For the inaugural lecture, there will be \"first flush\" samples of a rare Sri Lankan green, an Orange Pekoe black and a Flowery Orange Pekoe black tea. And for comparison, there will also be samples of regular black teas from the same region (6 PM; suggested donation of $10 goes to City Harvest; reservations recommended; 212-941-7832).

For his book, Sandwiches of the World, NYC photographer Alan “Battman” Batt snapped the layered creations of 108 chefs and snagged the recipes. (A portion of book proceeds goes to The Children's Storefront, an independent, tuition-free elementary school in Harlem.) And while most are still recognizably sandwiches, others take the term to a new level. Here are a handful of images and a challenge – can you name the chef behind the sandwich?

A special menu from chef Christophe Bellanca with suggested pairings will begin on Friday, and 30 wines will be available by the glass. Meanwhile, down in the East Village, Bowery Wine Company, a 60-seat wine bar/cafe, debuts tomorrow (13 E. First St.). Below are some more recent openings for oenophiles.

If you've been craving a Spanish-themed evening while overlooking the Hudson, this is the event for you. Tomorrow night, the Hudson River Café in Harlem is hosting a six-course dinner of Spanish wines paired with innovative Spanish dishes, and there is still space available. Food-wise, the evening ranges from bacalao and potato fritters with black caviar and crema nata to pan-seared veal medallions, by way of pepper-crusted filet mignon and grilled quail. The wines will hail from well-regarded vineyards including Bodegas del Cenit, Finca Allende, Vina Nora, Jorge Ordonez & Co. and Bodegas Llopart. And if you can't commit to the dinner, you can still taste the vino – the cafe will be hosting a free walk-around tasting of the evening's wines in its outdoor tent from 5–7 PM prior to the meal (7 PM; $95 per person; 212-491-9111).

Divine no more? Like so many of its peers, Divine Bar East (244 E. 51st St.), known for its vast wine selection and tapas, is giving up the ghost after 12 years of keeping the libations flowing. The culprit? Its monthly rent literally doubled. The bar's last day of business has been set for Saturday, March 29th. As a send-off, it will offer a \"Liquidate our Liquids\" happy hour from 5–7 PM every day until it closes. So go help them out by drinking up! But the news isn't all bad. At least owners Shari Schneider and Michael Vitanza are keeping their newer Divine Bar West ( 236 W. 54th St.) open for the foreseeable future. And if you bring in a \"Go West\" postcard (distributed by the Eastside location) to Divine Bar West, you will get 15% off.

If you crave a restaurant week tailored to Brooklyn, with none of that city-wide nonsense, then Dine-In Brooklyn would like your attention, please. From Monday, March 24th–Monday, March 31st, participating restaurants will offer three-course prix fixe lunches and dinners for the reasonable price of $23. Some of the notable spots involved this year include Alchemy, Alma, Blue Ribbon, Rose Water, Lunetta, Stone Park, Tempo, L & B Spumoni Gardens, River Café, Chez Oskar and ici. Some only offer lunch or dinner (not both), so it's a good idea to double-check with the restaurant when you're making reservations. For the full list of eateries, go to visitbrooklyn.org.

For the Love of Tap Water

photo: courtesy of Brian Turner In the U.S., tap water too often gets taken for granted. From March 16th–22nd, it will finally get the attention it deserves thanks to Unicef's Tap Project. Participating restaurants will ask diners to donate $1 for each glass of water they would normally receive for free. For every dollar raised, Unicef will provide a child with clean drinking water for 40 days. The initiative began last year, with 300 eateries in NYC collecting over $100,000. This year, even more have joined the effort, which has also gone nationwide with more than 2,000 restaurants total. Participating establishments in NYC include Le Bernardin, The Modern, Tabla and The Spotted Pig; for a full list go to www.tapproject.org.

Are These Truly The 10 Most Intriguing New Restaurants in the Land?

Central Michel Richard photo: Mimi Le What do you think are the most intriguing new restaurants? Do you agree with Frank Bruni's list? Tell us what you think on the Zagat Discussion boards! Without a doubt, New York Times restaurant critic Frank Bruni knows food. But as far as his reviews for the Grey Lady go, they are understandably centered around the five boroughs. Recently, Bruni ventured beyond city limits to track down the 10 most \"intriguing new restaurants outside of New York\" and has been reviewing a few each week in the NYT's food section. The group Bruni chose (see below) gets very good Zagat food ratings – nothing below a 24, with Las Vegas' Guy Savoy weighing in at a whopping 28. Three were too new to be rated, as our surveys have not been completed yet. To arrive at his top 10, Bruni visited 15 restaurants around the country that came highly recommended, only considering those that had opened between January 2006–December 2007. Then he knocked off his least favorite five. Here are the restaurants that made Bruni's final cut, in alphabetical order: Central Michel Richard, Washington, DC Cochon, New Orleans Coi, San Francisco Fraîche, Los Angeles Fearing's, Dallas Guy Savoy, Las Vegas Michael's Genuine Food & Drink, Miami o ya, Boston Tilth, Seattle Ubuntu, San Francisco

Obama Fans Get Their Own Beer

***CONTENT
Talking politics in bars is a tradition as old as alehouses themselves. But drinking politics? Now you can do that too, thanks to Brooklyn microbrewery SixPoint Craft Ales, which has brewed a batch (about 30 kegs) named Hop Obama in honor of the Illinois senator. Made from five different kinds of European crystal malt and three different kinds of Pacific Northwest Hops, the ale is available for the next few weeks at bars in New York and Boston. With no direct affiliation with Barack Obama's campaign, SixPoint claims the drink is not an endorsement but a \"response to his campaign at the grass roots level.\" But while the brewery isn't technically using Hop Obama to endorse the Democratic candidate, some of the bars serving it certainly are. Pacific Standard in Park Slope will donate $1 to Obama's campaign for every $6 pint sold, unless the buyer asks them not to. If you're curious to see what \"change\" tastes like, other local bars expecting shipments of Hop Obama this week include Blind Tiger and Ginger Man in Manhattan and Southpaw and Cherry Tree in Brooklyn.

The bottomless glasses at the New York Wine Expo photo: Karen Hudes Tango dancers entertained the tipplers. photo: Karen Hudes While the chance to sip your way through your choice of 600 global wines sounds like an oenophile's fantasia, for anyone who appreciates a little atmosphere with her vino, the New York Wine Expo in the carpeted convention hall of the Jacob Javits Center was a bit, well, dry. Some participants did their best to add extra color for the Friday night opening, especially the Wines of Argentina contingent that brought tango dancers to the stage. And Oregon's Naked Winery charmed the crowd by offering the cheekiest icebreaker: \"Wanna get naked?\" (They were applying temporary tattoos, too.) Happily, tastings of South African pinotage, Spanish Rueda and pear-honey wine from Long Island Meadery, plus zesty snacks like Irish cheddars and lemon sherbet, all excited the palate. A few enterprising vintners gave a preview of New York happenings afoot, such as the new Brooklyn Oenology label, which is exhibiting at BAM's Brooklyn Uncorked wine-and-food fest in May and sponsoring rooftop films by the Gowanus Canal this summer. Also represented was City Winery, which will open on Varick Street this fall with an onsite winery (the first in Manhattan), as well as a wine bar, cheese bar (by Murray's) and the opportunity for connoisseurs to own personal barrels. - Karen Hudes

The cast of Top Chef Chicago photo: Courtesy of Bravo This Wednesday, Bravo's Top Chef returns to the airwaves for its fourth season. This time around, the action has been shot in the Windy City, where hosts Tom Colicchio, Padma Lakshmi, Gail Simmons and Ted Allen will winnow down a new crop of 16 cheftestants down to one Top Chef. While watching the toques compete in Quickfire Challenges (such as last season's mise en place relay race or the Bombay Sapphire cocktail competition) and Elimination Challenges (such as catering a yacht party) provides plenty of amusement, you might yearn to actually taste their creations – at least the winning dishes. Since licking the TV screen never satisfies, the best option is to eat at the restaurants where the cheftestants either currently work or most recently worked. Here's where you can find them in NYC, and around the country. New York City: Buddakan – Dale is a sous-chef at this opulent Asian fusion restaurant in Chelsea. Dos Caminos – Manuel, who has worked at Mario Batali's ever-popular Babbo, is now the executive chef at the Midtown location of this high-end Mexican mini-chain. Mai House – Spike works at this TriBeCa Vietnamese as the chef de cuisine. Public – Not only does Mark work at this NoLita Eclectic, but Lisa used to work there too. 24 Prince – Nikki has been a co-owner/chef at this NoLita American since it opened in 2005. Atlanta: Repast – Nimma is the chef at this Midtown New American, which is known for having creative, edgy cuisine. Los Angeles: Foxtail – Antonia, who worked at Spago for six years, is now the chef at this glam WeHo newcomer. San Francisco: Circa – Erik is the executive chef at this swanky Marina New American. Coco 500 – Jennifer is the executive chef at this SoMa Californian. Myth Café – Ryan works as a chef at this popular Downtown New American, though he's rumored to be leaving just as Top Chef begins to air.

But we’re betting that will change quickly when its rooftop lounge opens to the public around May. Details are scarce – we can only confirm that the space has been leased by Jeffrey Chodorow's China Grill Management, which plans to renovate it. They hope to make more information public soon. Meanwhile, check out these photos from the hotel’s website and picture yourself sipping a cocktail by the glow of the hotel’s iconic sign.

Zagat's own Merrill Shindler on VH1's Flavor of Love Watching myself the other day on VH1’s reality show Flavor of Love, I realized I had played my role as “restaurant critic” all wrong. I had been invited to appear on episode three to help Flavor Flav (formerly the comic relief in the politically-driven rap group Public Enemy) decide which of the restaurants created by two competing teams better expressed his larger-than-life personality. No, what I wore wasn’t my mistake. I knew there was no way for me to compete with the Flavor Flav signature style – bright colored clothing, oversized clock-necklaces, hair like a living troll doll, etc. I wore a silk Jhane Barnes t-shirt and a tuxedo jacket – classy but casual and (slimming, too). What I did wrong on the show was to… smile. I smiled a lot. Actually, I grinned like an idiot the whole time. I think it was just part of my look of astonishment – the sort of look a deer in headlights would have if deer smiled. I should have been channeling Anton Ego from Ratatouille. Instead, I was Paula Abdul on American Idol. I was smiling because being on Flavor of Love is about as much fun as can be had with your clothing on (not that those young ladies had much on). Flavor Flav is so totally… himself. I've rarely met a human so utterly at home in his own skin – and in his own clothing. (Love that powder-blue zoot suit he wore when he took the winner of the challenge on a date to Tony Roma's!) And honestly – we bonded. We discovered we had grown up just a few blocks away from each other in The Bronx. We both went to Yankee games as kids. We were homeboys – of a sort. So what about those restaurants that the ladies created? Well, they did their best, though cooking clearly isn't one of their great talents – when you spend your days (and nights) in hot pants and halter tops, when would you hone your culinary skills? Salt seemed to be a very popular ingredient. Curdled-cream sauces were big too. A lot was made of the fact that one of the desserts was from Cheesecake Factory; indeed, one of the team leaders had a meltdown because the server told us that. I had no problem with it – Cheesecake Factory makes a fine cheesecake. And they kept refilling our glasses with Hennessey – one of rap's favorite libations. Hey, maybe that's why I was grinning so much. I was downing Crunk Juice, in quantity. Ah, now that's the Flavor of Love. - Merrill Shindler

***CONTENT
New York oenophiles have a reason to rejoice as the First Annual New York Wine Expo takes place this Friday evening and Saturday afternoon at the Javits Center. (Sunday is a closed-to-the-public trade event.) This vino adventure is the younger sibling to the popular annual Wine Expos in Boston and Washington, DC. At the heart of the Expo is the Grand Tasting, which offers tipplers the chance to sample more than 600 wines from over 170 international winemakers in the cavernous convention center. But the Expo won't just be wild bacchanalia – it features numerous seminars on subjects like Argentinean Malbecs and the diversity of Long Island wines (March 7, 7–10 PM, $85 per person; March 8, 2–6 PM, $95 per person; seminars between $30–$35 per person; 655 W. 34th St.; for advance tickets click here).

By Curt Gathje, ZAGAT.com staff editorHere's what you need to know about the world's most famous hotel. The Plaza's new lobby and Champagne Barphoto: Ryan Charles Back after a two-year hiatus for a top-to-toe renovation, the legendary Plaza Hotel has been remade into a mixed-use building comprised of high-end condos, luxe hotel rooms, ritzy restaurants and posh shops. It’s currently in soft opening mode, with the grand, all-systems-go reopening set for May 10th. Here’s what lies ahead. A standard hotel roomphoto: Ryan Charles Hotel Rooms: Approximately 280 hotel rooms and suites will be available to transient guests (compared to 805 in the past), starting at a cool $1,000 per night. Since some are time-shares, the room inventory will fluctuate from day to day. At present about 80 rooms are ready, with the balance coming back in May. The renovated Palm Court photo: Ryan Charles Restaurants: Two historic restaurants are returning, the Oak Room and the Palm Court, official city landmarks that have been in operation since 1907. The Oak Room is still under renovation and due to reopen in late spring, with Joël Antunes (from Atlanta’s highly rated JOËL) manning the stoves. The Palm Court, now in soft opening, is serving three meals a day – plus its beloved high tea – under the supervision of executive chef Didier Virot (ex Aix); pastry chef Nicole Kaplan (ex Del Posto and Eleven Madison Park) is crafting the sweets. (The Palm Court’s original beaux arts skylight, dismantled in 1944, has been reconstructed as part of the overall renovation, and is quite a sight to behold.) Finally, two former restaurants, The Edwardian Room and Oyster Bar, are being reconfigured into retail space. Nightlife: The Champagne Bar (pictured at top), an L-shaped lounge flanking the lobby, is now open; the Rose Club, a mezzanine-level lounge offering cocktails and small-plate accompaniments, is due in late March. The Oak Bar, the Plaza’s most famous barroom and the site of its movie debut (Alfred Hitchcock’s North by Northwest), will return in early summer. Shopping: The hotel’s retail presence will be greatly enhanced from its former collection of thimble-sized jewelers and chocolatiers. A new shopping corridor along the 58th Street side of the building is due in late spring and will include such tony vendors as Assouline Books, Demel Bakery, Ghurka, Jay Strongwater, Kenneth Jay Lane, MCM, Montblanc, Morgenthal Frederics, Peter Lik Fine Arts, Rachel Roy, Seize sur Vingt and Vertu. As for the rest of the place, all of the 180 condominiums offered were sold, one for $51,539,180, the highest price ever paid for a NY apartment; four additional condos sold in excess of $40 million apiece, at an eye-popping $6,400 a square foot. And if there’s any doubt that the Gilded Age lives on, rumor has it that one new resident purchased space in the basement for his own private swimming pool.

It's been awhile since summer 2006, which is when Laurence Cresci shut the doors of his Manhattan Grille in east Midtown. But that doesn't mean the restaurateur behind Portofino Grille is done with the space. He's planning to open Creston's Bar & Grill, a steakhouse with American favorites, there in May (319 E. 53rd; 212-888-6556).

photo: Paul Lansell Planning an enormous brunch for the whole family might be more difficult this year with Easter Sunday landing so early on March 23rd. So why not leave the cooking to the pros? To help you get your plans in order, the Buzz has compiled a list of notable spots with special Easter brunch menus where space is still available. Aquavit: For a Scandinavian take on the holiday, look no further than Marcus Samuelsson's popular Midtown destination where chef Johan Svensson will prepare a \"Swedish Smorgasbord\" for the all-you-can-eat brunch. Expect espresso-mustard herring, tandoori-smoked salmon, Vasterbotten cheese, leg of lamb and much, much more (11:45 AM–3 PM; $60 per person; 212-307-7311). Aureole: Charlie Palmer's beloved Upper East Side New American is offering a three-course prix fixe with three-pepper seared quail, three-cheese ravioli, a roasted leg of lamb with mint-pesto and more; a children's menu is also available (1–9 PM; $95 per adult; $45 per child; menu available online here; 212-319-1660). BLT Market: Laurent Tourondel's newest venture in the Ritz-Carlton Central Park will serve its regular breakfast menu until 11 AM, then it will switch over to a three-course prix fixe that includes dishes like scrambled eggs with truffle-butter mouillette, black-and-blue ahi tuna with fava-and-green-bean salad, a Gruyère-cheese popover with grilled bacon, herb-crusted rack of lamb and a cranberry-rhubarb-granola tart (noon–8 PM; $95 per person; 212-521-6125). Eleven Madison Park: Danny Meyer's vaulted-ceilinged gem in Gramercy Park will be serving a four-course Easter prix fixe all day. Arrive hungry for offerings like white asparagus velouté with Oregon morels, foie gras terrine with golden pineapple and pickled pearl onions, lamb with glazed Bosc pears and eggplant and more (11:30 AM–6 PM; $98 per person; 212-889-0905). San Domenico: Luckily the jackets-only rule at this CPS Italian shouldn't be a problem in your Sunday finest; expect a special tasting menu ($85) based on local ingredients in addition to the usual à la carte selections (1–9 PM; 212-265-5959). Tavern on the Green: Children won't get bored at this Central Park special-occasion standard. Along with a three-course prix fixe meal, entertainment will include the Easter Bunny, assorted Alice in Wonderland characters, a Mad Hatters Bonnet Parade, a petting zoo, pony rides, face painters, balloon artists and a strolling guitarist (11 AM–8 PM; $116 per person for seating in the Crystal Room, $82 per person in all other rooms, children under 12 are half-price; for more information go here; 212-873-3200).

As usual, the transformation will be reflected in chef Craig Koketsu's seasonal menu as well as in the decor, which will be redesigned by the talented folks at AvroKO (100 E. 63rd St.; 212-644-1900).

Zagat has officially confirmed these closings: Midtown lost one of its beloved French restaurants last week when René Pujol closed after 38 years; recently it had been run as a cooperative. The neighborhood also bid sayonara to Tsushima and adios to the East 43rd Street branch of Burritoville. On the Upper West Side, Cafe La Fortuna, known as being a favorite of John Lennon, closed up shop last week after 32 years. Also gone is Broadway's Caffe Pertutti. The Upper East Side lost Really Cool Foods. Shiki, a sushi purveyor, was replaced by Ging, which also offers raw fish. In the East Village, Bodeguita Cubana, Nolia and Sea Salt have all given up the ghost. Bouche Bar is now Black Iron Burger Bar. Across town, the Hudson Street branch of Le Gamin has become The New French. Below Houston, Cafe Tina and Kin Khao in SoHo have closed their doors, as has Buono Amici in the South Street Seaport. Flames Steakhouse on Gold Street is now Giardino D'oro. Finally in the outer boroughs, Biscuit BBQ in Park Slope is gone, as is Buck's Lodge in Brooklyn Heights. Villa Portofino in Staten Island has become Ocean 3.

The ever-expanding list of dining options in the Lower East Side is about to get longer and greener. Coming in the first week of March is a new Modern Vegetarian called Broadway East with chef Lee Gross (ex LA's M Café de Chaya) at the helm. Focusing on fresh fare, Gross, who has worked as Gwyneth Paltrow's personal chef, plans to source ingredients within 500 miles when possible. Designed and owned by the architects Joel Barkley and Ron Castellano and the contractor Joel Wong, Broadway East attempts to further up its green cred by boasting a \"soil-based\" back wall covered in plant life (171 East Broadway).

Sake Stakes Its Claim on the Wine List

By Troy Segal, ZAGAT.com staff editor Restaurants are finding that sake goes with more than just sushi. Chanterelle: Sake served here. photo: Noah Kalina On February 26th, Tocqueville – a bastion of French-American fare in NYC – is giving a wine-pairing dinner at the James Beard Foundation’s prestigious Beard House. Nothing unusual about that. What is unusual are the beverages to be paired with the meal, a compendium of Eastern and Western dishes. With the sashimi and soba noodles, guests will be drinking Rieslings. And with the deviled quail eggs, the monkfish foie gras and the beef sirloin, they’ll be drinking – sake. Long a staple of sushi bars, sake is known to most Americans – if they know it at all – as a generic, hot high-octane drink you toss back in between bites of raw fish. But there are many different grades, flavors and styles of this ancient Japanese rice wine, and it’s the more premium varietals – served chilled like their grape counterparts, bearing musical names like Wandering Poet, Pride of the Village or Moon on the Water – that, increasingly, are coming to a wine list near you. \"Even six years ago, you’d be hard-pressed to find sake on any wine list,” says Paul Einbund, partner/sommelier at San Francisco’s Coi, a Californian-French eatery that offers seven varieties. “Now, at most places with major beverage programs, you’d be hard-pressed not to find it.” Indeed, distributors say sake has seen the most consistent growth in their beverage portfolios, with U.S. imports increasing 12% a year over the last decade. Furthermore, “the quality of sake coming into the U.S. is much higher than it was before,” says Chris Pearce, owner of World Sake Imports in Honolulu. Pearce notes that “many chefs are big sake fans. They like the way it supports food. Milder, more subdued than wine, it doesn’t call as much attention to itself.” The concept of “quality sake,” which represents about a quarter of the overall supply, is relatively new. Although sake is at least 1,000 years old, for much of its history it was a crude, commonplace brew (while it’s usually called “rice wine,” productionwise it’s really closer to rice beer – a combination of white rice, water, koji mold and yeast that’s fermented and then aged, usually for six months). The premium variety (see our sake glossary) is a post–World War II phenomenon: in an effort to combat declining sales – the result of competition from European spirits and vinos – small, regional producers began making more refined and complex sakes, similar to the way the scotch industry started pushing single malts, and Kentucky distilleries started producing smoother, aged bourbons for elite markets back in the 1980s. At first, Japan kept these artisanal labels to itself, but with the globalization trends of the ’90s, marketing efforts broadened; around 1995, importing methods improved too, with the use of refrigerated containers – crucial for allowing these delicate brews to keep their flavor, notes Ataru Kobayashi, a New York City based importer of brands from the Niigata region. “So at last American consumers were able to taste real, premium sakes. Once they do, they’re hooked.” Of course, the increased interest in sake also reflects the explosion of Japanese cuisine in general, and sushi in particular, in the U.S. (even that old venerable, Benihana, introduced a list of fine sakes as part of a chain-wide revamp in 2005). Pan-Asian and Asian fusion places helped boost its popularity as well, with restaurant groups such as Sushi Samba, Buddakan and Roy’s offering it in hip forms like flights or cocktails. While it’s still Asian eateries that carry the most extensive lists, a growing number of other establishments are pouring it on as well. Chanterelle, the renowned French restaurant in Downtown Manhattan, has been hosting annual nine-course sake-tasting dinners since 1999, and regularly offers 10 to 18 sakes, depending on the season. At first, customers “are very leery” about trying them, says Roger Dagorn, Chanterelle’s wine director. But he encourages them to try one of his premium, small-producer labels by itself (as an apéritif or digestif) or to accompany a course on the tasting menu (he’s paired it with dishes such as scallop-and-foie-gras dumplings, lobster mousse and smoked duck with anise sauce) – and they’re “pleasantly surprised by the character and flavor.” An interest in the flavors of Asian cuisine frequently leads many a Western chef to the rice brew. Kitchen Club, an intimate French-Japanese in Manhattan’s NoLita neighborhood, offers 25 varieties along with sake-based cocktails. “It just seemed logical, given the Japanese influence in my food,” says chef-owner Marja Samsom, whose specialties range from peppercorn-crusted filet mignon to pork and prune–stuffed fried dumplings. The growing interest in the drink, as customers “have gotten the confidence to order it,” also prompted her to open Chibi’s, a sake bar annex, a decade ago. At Mark’s CityPlace in Palm Beach, a New American seafood specialist owned by chef-restaurateur Mark Militello, executive chef Roy Villacrusis recently increased the number of sakes offered. Villacrusis “brings a lot of Asian influences to the menu” – including sushi rolls, swordfish in a soy emulsion and pasta in a sake sauce – and finds that the rice wine “goes well with that.” Given that most Americans first sample sake at a sushi bar, it’s logical that many of the places adopting the beverage are seafooders. Go Fish, chef-owner Cindy Pawlcyn’s new Napa Valley fish house, is already planning to expand its sake selection of 18 premium brews by the bottle and 11 by the glass – in the heart of California wine country, no less. Calling sake “an up-and-coming drink,” sous-chef/sommelier Stuart Morris estimates that almost one-third of the clientele orders it. With a surf ’n’ turf combo – like tuna and sweetbreads – he recommends a variety with mushroomy overtones. For fried fare, he suggests a brand with a fruity, round mouth feel. “Anything you can do with wine, you can do with sake,” Morris says, confessing that “braised short ribs might be a challenge.” Bob Kanter, owner of Memphis Minnie’s BBQ Joint in the Lower Haight area of San Francisco, clearly doesn’t feel that way. He serves 10 varieties, with sweet names like Seventh Heaven and Chrysanthemum Meadow but with robust, woodsy flavors to stand up to the ’cue. Kanter says he was into sake before he got involved with BBQ: “I was amazed by the variety of tastes and flavors – just from rice!” Sake represents about 25% of his alcohol sales, and it’s growing. “At first I was drinking more than I was selling. Now it’s the opposite – and I’m not cutting back on my drinking.” Carnivores can also sample sake at the Boa steakhouses in Los Angeles and Las Vegas, siblings to Katana, a West Hollywood robata grill/sushi bar with a strong list of labels. “When we saw how well the beef [and sake] matched at Katana, it was a no-brainer” to offer it at Boa says Tom Cardenas, vice-president of operations at Innovative Dining Group. Even so, some sommeliers shrink from serving sake with anything “rich, reduced or stewed,” as Coi’s Paul Einbund puts it. “Crisp, clean, pure flavors – that’s when sake comes to mind. It’s a delicate beverage, one that shows better with elegant dishes, pinpointing ingredients like a laser beam.” He’s been putting sake on Coi’s wine-pairing menu (which roughly half the clientele orders) ever since the innovative Californian-French restaurant opened in San Francisco’s North Beach in April 2006. He also likes “using it to cleanse the palate” between courses. The taste for sake is “still growing – most guests order wine. Once a week, we sell a full bottle of sake,” he admits. “But at $160 a bottle, that’s pretty impressive.” Charlie Trotter’s, a top-rated New American in Chicago, also includes sake among the wine-pairing options on its prix fixe menus (indeed, a client once asked that all 12 courses on the chef’s table menu be paired with a sake). “Chef Trotter’s cuisine has a strong minimalistic aesthetic – so you can see how sake, which is so subtle and pristine in character, would be in line with our culinary philosophy,” says sommelier Conrad Reddick. The restaurant carries some 25 seasonally changing sakes by the bottle (and a smaller number of choices by the glass). The selection gets an especially great response from those allergic to sulfites or other additives, since quality sake doesn’t contain any, Reddick notes. Admittedly, sake is hardly elbowing Bordeaux and Burgundies off of Western wine lists. But more and more restaurateurs feel that it deserves a place at the table. “It’s just another part of good dining,” says Marco Moreira, chef-owner of Tocqueville. “You serve white wine, red wine – why not sake?”

Sake Glossary: Decoding a Rising Star

***CONTENT
By Troy Segal, ZAGAT.com staff editor You don't have to speak Japanese to know what kind of sake you're getting; learning a few important terms goes a long way. Exploring the sake solar system can seem daunting – and not just because the labels are in Japanese. Unlike wine and its relation to grapes, sake isn’t categorized by its primary ingredient, rice (though different strains of rice are used), but by the degree to which the rice grains have been ground down, or \"polished,\" to their inner starchy layer. It’s also classified by the presence, and amount, of distilled alcohol that’s been added during brewing (sakes usually have an alcohol content of 14–16%, compared to wine’s 12%). Adding to the confusion, these categories can overlap. Like single-malt scotches’, sake styles also reflect their region of origin – for example, the brands of the Niigata prefecture are prized for their crisp, dry, pristine profile – and even their individual breweries. “My advice is to think of the different categories as styles rather than as quality levels,” says Spence Porter, a New York City wine consultant. “Great sakes are to be found in all of them.” Daiginjo: Sake whose rice has been milled (or “polished”), so that only 50% of the original grain remains. An excellent apéritif, or to accompany lighter foods. Genshu: Undiluted sake, whose alcohol content can be as high as 20%, vs. the usual 14–16%. When you need that extra kick. Ginjo: Sake whose rice has been milled down to 60% of its original size. For many, the starting point of premium sake – refined yet flavorful and fruity; often works with sashimi and sushi. Honjozo: Sake made up of water, rice and mold, with a bit of distilled alcohol (no more than 25% of the overall alcoholic content) added to enhance flavor and aroma. Like Junmai, the rice has been “polished” down to 70%. A good accompaniment to boiled dishes and stews. Junmai: Sake consisting purely of water, rice and mold, with no distilled alcohol added. Though no longer required to by law, most Junmai makers mill the rice down to 70% of its original size; tokubetsu Junmai has been “polished” a bit more – to about 65%. Full-bodied, many work well with grilled meats and oily or creamy dishes. Junmai Daiginjo: The crème de la crème of the beverage – sake that is pure water, mold and rice, with the latter milled down to 50%. Especially delicate and flowery, it’s well-suited to fresh seafood and poached dishes. Junmai Ginjo: Sake consisting purely of water, mold and rice that’s been milled down to 60% of the original grain. Lighter than Junmai, it’s still earthy; good with fried foods and pastas. Koshu: Aged sake. A relatively recent phenom in the industry, this brew is laid down for several years before bottling (most sake ages only six months). Richer and heavier-tasting, often compared to sherry or port, it’s a good digestif or dessert wine. Namazake: Unpasteurized sake. Prized for its fresh, lively taste, this is definitely one to keep cold – and to drink soon. Works as an apéritif, and with cheese. Nigori: Sweetish sake that’s unfiltered or roughly filtered, leaving a residue of rice polishings at the bottom. Shake before you sip – it looks like you’re drinking milk.

The Bouley team has a lot on its plate for 2008. The new Bouley, which will be at 161 Duane Street, is now projected to open in late spring, probably May. After its debut, the current Bouley, one short block away from the new one, will turn into Bouley Market, featuring retail space and a cafe with a light menu. There are no immediate plans, however, to change Bouley, Upstairs. The opening of Brushstrokes, the Bouley Japanese project at 109 W. Broadway, won't happen until October. If we lost you with all that, just start wandering around TriBeCa. You're bound to run into at least one of the Bouley outposts.

The writers' strike that's crippled Hollywood for the past three months has ended. The scribes are heading back to work, and some will be busy working on the Academy Awards airing this Sunday, February 24th.Now that the Oscars are back from the brink, the annual question of where to watch them returns. One option is the Oscar party at Time Warner Center's Landmarc. Marc Murphy's classy bistro is putting two flat screen TVs in its private dinning room and offering a four-course tasting menu (plus dessert) designed to last the length of the show. In the works are classics like steak-tartare crostini, potato-leek soup with caviar whipped cream and beef wellington with perigourdine sauce and asparagus. One bottle of champagne per twosome is also part of the deal (7:45 PM; $80 per person; 212-823-6123).

Where the Actors Are the Owners (Not Just the Waiters)

Have you been to a celebrity-owned restaurant?Are they worth the hype? Share your thoughts on the Zagat Discussion boards! With the writers' strike finally over and the Academy Awards just around the corner on February 24th, most of Hollywood is thinking about who will be taking home that little gold guy. But not everybody can win an Oscar, so financially prudent actors might find themselves pondering potential side businesses. And if they want a tried-and-true second gig, the food industry is very welcoming to thespians. We're talking about owning here, not waiting on tables or tending bar. LA is arguably the capital of the celeb-backed restaurant. The scene-heavy Melrose Italian Dolce Enotca e Ristorante has backing from the likes of Ashton Kutcher; the same group also owns the newish Ketchup,which boasts Wilmer Valderrama and Tara Reid as backers. Then there's Cathy Moriarty's pizza mini-chain Mulberry St. Pizza. Over in Pasadena, Jennifer Lopez opened Madre's, a glamour Puerto Rican dining spot. And, don't forget about Eva Longoria Parker and Todd English's upcoming Beso. Even Steven Spielberg's mother has her own kosher dairy kitchen, Milky Way. Although Johnny Depp no longer owns the Viper Room, the House of Blues, with investors ranging from Dan Aykroyd to Aerosmith, is still going strong. For Robert De Niro, winning two Oscars wasn't enough – he still wanted to become an über-restaurateur. In West Hollywood, he has Ago, a pricey Tuscan that recently opened a location in Las Vegas and is on its way to New York. He has Rubicon in San Francisco and Nobu, Nobu 57 and Tribeca Grill in New York. Paul Newman, also an Oscar winner, opened the Dressing Room, an organic New American that sits adjacent to wife Joanne Woodward’s beloved Westport Country Playhouse in Westport, CT. Oscar winner Timothy Hutton put some money into the Midtown pub P.J. Clarke's, which now has three locations. And Oscar-winning director (and actor) Quentin Tarantino was an early investor in Korean Barbecue Do Hwa in New York City. Indeed, NYC has no shortage of celeb-backed ventures. Justin Timberlake (yes, he's an actor too) recently brought Memphis BBQ to the Upper East Side via Southern Hospitality. Chris Noth's nightspot in the Flatiron, the Cutting Room, offers a performance space for all types of acts. The first Planet Hollywood even landed in Gotham and although the chain has lost some of its swagger and some of its original backers (most notably the Governator Arnold Schwarzenegger) it still has Bruce Willis and Sylvester Stallone to stand behind the 18 locations around the world, plus a recently opened Planet Hollywood Resort & Casino in Las Vegas. While the majority of actor-backed restaurants are in the celeb-infested environs of New York and LA, they do pop up elsewhere. In 2006, Sandra Bullock teamed with chef Brenton Childs to open Bess in Austin. Don Johnson and Cheech Marin are both backers behind San Fransisco's French-Vietnamese Ana Mandara. And in Paris, Gérard Depardieu has two restaurants: the Classic French La Fontaine Gaillon and the raw bar L'Ecaille de la Fontaine.

That's Entertainment: Where to Go for Dinner and a Show

By Jeff Freier, ZAGAT.com staff editor From Blues to Bouzouki, the entertainment at these restaurants promises a memorable meal Boston Chicago London Los Angeles New York City Philadelphia San Francisco Washington, DC Dining out is entertaining in its own right, but if you want to put some extra pizzazz in your pasta, spark in your steak or glamour in your guacamole, a little show biz with your supper may be in order. And that doesn’t have to mean a sad, lonely piano player tinkling away in the corner. Whatever you're in the mood for – a little German oompah perhaps? some Latino sizzle? Sinatra cool? gender-bending acts? – you’ll find something of interest in the following lineup. So sit down, eat and enjoy the show, folks. Just remember to check websites or call ahead for updated schedules and information. Boston Jacob Wirth: “Sing us a song, you’re the piano man”…Mel Stiller plays that role at this Theater District institution (circa 1868) known for its German eats and Friday night sing-alongs, which emphasize ’50s–’80s rock along with show tunes and standards (31-37 Stuart St.; 617-338-8586). Jacob Wirth Johnny D’s Uptown: Fill up on a smorgasbord of funk, jazz, rock, Latin, blues, rockabilly, folk and salsa lessons at this Somerville American featuring some big-name acts on the marquee; dinner reservations in advance guarantee a seat for the show (17 Holland St., Somerville; 617-776-2004). Kowloon: Welcome to Fantasy Island – this Polynesian amusement park in Saugus has everything but the kitschen sink (dinner theater, stand-up comedy, lounge singers, pupu platters, lighted waterfalls) in its sprawling, multiroomed complex (948 Broadway/Rte. 1, Saugus; 781-233-0077). Les Zygomates: Spend an evening in the Left Bank without the plane fare, cigarette smoke or attitude at this Leather District French where you can listen to live jazz every night (starting at 8 PM) and sip from an extensive wine list (129 South St.; 617-542-5108). Lucky’s Lounge: You can ring-a-ding-ding to the jazzy lounge music while digging into your American chow at this Sinatra-hip retro speakeasy in the Seaport District that’s as cool and breezy as the summer wind (live music Wednesday–Sunday, Sinatra Nights are Sundays and Wednesdays; 355 Congress St.; 617-357-5825). Back to Top Chicago Edelweiss: Got an oompah and schnitzel monkey on your back? Then make this suburban German-American your headquarters. There’s live Deutsche music Friday–Sunday and, of course, an authentic beer selection that will make you shout wunderbar! (7650 W. Irving Park Rd., Norridge; 708-452-6040). Smoke Daddy Kit Kat Lounge & Supper Club: It’s not your father’s supper club at this Boys Town Eclectic where you can start off with the Zsa Zsa Gabor appetizer, followed by the Salmon Sez entree washed down with a Godiva White Chocolate martini while being serenaded by a dazzling lineup of female-impersonating divas (3700 N. Halsted St.; 773-525-1111). The Lobby: If you need more style and class in your life – not to mention chocolate – try this River North Continental seafooder that has a jazz trio with vocalist on Fridays and Saturdays along with a chocolate buffet (Peninsula Hotel, 108 E. Superior St., 5th fl.; 312-573-6760). Shaw’s Crab House: Skip the formal Main Dining Room, loosen your toupee and let the good times roll in the jumpin’ Oyster Room at this River Norther offering blues, jazz, oysters and sushi (21 E. Hubbard St.; 312-527-2722). Smoke Daddy: The BBQ is finger-lickin’ good and the blues and jazz are smokin’ hot at this Wicker Parker that sports vintage photos of music legends on the walls and features live bands every night with never a cover in sight (1804 W. Division St.; 773-772-6656). Back to Top London Big Easy: If like some folks your New Year’s resolution is to eat more ribs and lobster, then check out this raucous King’s Road crab shack where the eating’s accompanied by live rock bands every night (332-334 King’s Rd., Chelsea; 020-7352 4071). The Pigalle Club Boisdale: There’s no need to argue anymore when you’re hankering for haggis but your partner wants to listen to live jazz – both are found at these British-Scottish spots, where The Boisdale Blue Rhythm Band (playing jazz from the ’30s, ’40s and ’50s) and other acts jam at the Eccleston Street locale, while the piano bar grooves over at Bishopsgate (13 Eccleston St., Victoria, 020-7730 6922; Swedeland Ct., 202 Bishopsgate, 020-7283 1763). Floridita: Rumba your way to this large and loud Wardour Street Latino for authentic comida, live Cuban music and rum, rum and more rum (100 Wardour St., Soho; 020-7314 4000). Oxo Tower Brasserie: Even if Basil Fawlty were running this South Bank brasserie, he couldn’t screw up its recipe for success – a great view of the city across the Thames, Asian-Med cuisine and live jazz every night (Oxo Tower Wharf, Barge House St.; 020-7803 3888). The Pigalle Club: Break out of your 21st-century rut with some 1940s-style glamour at this Piccadilly supper club, where mirrored walls and soft table lighting set the mood for an array of big- and small-name acts, from jazz to swing to rock (215 Piccadilly, Piccadilly; 020-7734 8142). Back to Top Los Angeles Alegria: Live Latina bands, flamenco shows with audience participation, tapas and fantástico sangria keep things sizzling at this Long Beach Nuevo Latino (115 Pine Ave., Long Beach; 562-436-3388). Vibrato Grill & Jazz Cuban Bistro: “Luuucy, I’m going to the club” – Ricky Ricardo would feel right at home at this energetic Alhambra bistro showcasing Cuban food and live entertainment (Fridays and Saturdays). If you see a woman with a mustache onstage, it’s probably just Lucy trying to finagle her way into the show (28 W. Main St., Alhambra; 626-308-3350). Galletto Bar and Grill: You’ll be saying yeah, yeah, yeah to the British invasion as well as classic rock, bossa nova, jazz, you name it – it’s all belted out live at this Italian-Brazilian in Westlake Village seven nights a week (Westlake Plaza, 982 S. Westlake Blvd., Westlake Village; 805-449-4300). Great Greek: If just watching the entertainment is too sedate for you, roll up your sleeves and be part of the act at this Sherman Oaks Greek joint where you might find yourself dancing in the aisles with the waiters, while bouzouki music jangles and plates go a-smashing (13362 Ventura Blvd., Sherman Oaks; 818-905-5250). Vibrato Grill & Jazz: With jazz as sweet as a taste of honey and a beautiful room as airy as whipped cream, Herb Alpert’s Bel-Air American is the perfect setting for a sophisticated, classy evening (2930 Beverly Glen Circle, Bel-Air; 310-474-9400). Back to Top New York City Bateaux New York: As if fabulous skyline views aren’t entertainment enough, this three-hour cruise aboard a glass-walled boat departing from Chelsea Piers features live jazz during dinner (Chelsea Piers, Pier 61; 212-352-2022). The Box The Box: Patterned after vaudeville houses of old (with the modern twist that it’s expensive and tough to get in), this Lower East Side hot spot is where you’ll find the hipoisie taking in decadent avant-garde-meets-Moulin-Rouge stage acts (189 Chrystie St.; 212-982-9301). Oak Room: The American fare comes with a side of NYC history at this Algonquin Hotel cabaret where you can mingle with the upper crust, make droll asides to the ghost of George S. Kaufman and listen to performers interpreting the Great American Songbook (Algonquin Hotel, 59 W. 44th St.; 212-840-6800). Rasputin: Slug back some vodka and get into the party spirit at this Russian-accented Brighton Beach restaurant/cabaret known for its unreal Las Vegas–style floor show (2670 Coney Island Ave., Brooklyn; 718-332-8111). Spotlight Live: You don’t have to be a star, baby, to be in this show but you’ll feel like one at this more-than-just-karaoke experience (pro backup singers, simulcasts on the streetside JumboTron) in Times Square serving a full American menu (1604 Broadway; 212-246-2693). Back to Top Philadelphia North by Northwest: Set in a former Woolworths, this Mount Airy American gives you more than a nickel-and-dime’s worth of entertainment thanks to its huge menu of live R&B, salsa, jazz, funk, rock, DJs, dancing and comedy (7165 Germantown Ave.; 215-248-1000). Ortlieb’s Jazzhaus: Cool cats and chickie babies make the scene at this cozy Northern Liberties Cajun where the old-time jazz will round the edges off any square from Squaresville (847 N. Third St.; 215-922-1035). World Café Live Victor Café: “O Sole Mio” – it’s a night at the opera (sans Groucho) at this South Philly Italian when the waiters break out into arias seven nights a week; N.B. don’t fret – there’s no Sanity Clause in the bill (1303-05 Dickinson St.; 215-468-3040). Vincent’s: Come hear former Nat King Cole pianist Al “Stumpy” Russell tickle the ivories while digging into your Wiener schnitzel at this West Chester Continental, or climb upstairs to experience the hot jazz and blues in the second-floor club (10 E. Gay St., West Chester; 610-696-4262). World Café Live: Eat to the beat at this split-level performance venue that was literally designed for music and features every kind of genre you can imagine with an American menu complementing the grooves (3025 Walnut St.; 215-222-1400). Back to Top San Francisco AsiaSF: Not for the staid, this SoMa hipster hot spot features gender illusionists performing on a red runway bar, color-morphing walls and a Cal-Asian menu featuring dishes like Asia-dillas and Baby Got Back ribs (201 Ninth St.; 415-255-2742). Shanghai 1930 Café Claude: Sneak down an alley, put on your beret and step into Paris at this French bistro where you can swing to magnifique jazz played Thursdays–Saturdays (7 Claude Ln.; 415-392-3515). Foreign Cinema: Multitaskers will appreciate the opportunity to combine movie-going and dining out at this Mission Cal-Med that shows foreign, independent and classic films out in their candlelit courtyard (2534 Mission St.; 415-648-7600). Shanghai 1930: You’ll find sultry jazz lingering in the air at this atmospheric Chinese in an exotic underground setting reminiscent of 1930s Shanghai (133 Stewart St.; 415-896-5600). Tonga Room: Check your three-piece suit at the door and slip into a mai tai as you rock and sway to the cover band that plays on a boat in the ‘lake’ that sits in the center of this campy Pan-Asian–Pacific Rim tiki party in Nob Hill (Fairmont Hotel, 950 Mason St.; 415-772-5278). Back to Top Washington, DC Busboys & Poets: It’s power to the people at these hoppin’, changin’-the-world U Street Corridor and Shirlington restaurant/lounge/bookstore/community spaces where you can listen to poets and musicians hold forth while digging into American-Eclectic fare (2021 14th St. NW, 202-387-7638; 4251 Campbell Ave, Arlington, VA, 703-379-9756). 701 Dukem: Scoop up some authentic fare with injera bread while scoping out the nightly live Ethiopian music at this U Street Corridor spot that also features a traditional Ethiopian coffee ceremony on Sunday afternoons (1114-1118 U St. NW; 202-667-8735). Primi Piatti: “Oh, ho, ho, it’s magic” at this Foggy Bottom Italian when chef-owner Savino Recine performs his sleight of hand and magical illusions for wowed diners (but no, he won’t make the bill disappear); call ahead to see when he’ll be performing (the next show will be April 5th; 2013 I St. NW; 202-223-3600). 701: There aren’t enough “o’s” in the word smooth to describe the soothing jazz that fills the dining room seven nights a week at this Penn Quarter American (701 Pennsylvania Ave. NW; 202-393-0701).

***CONTENT
The changes to the nightlife scene by the new Bowery Hotel just keep coming. Last night the East Village Yacht Club served its final cocktail in its home at 42 E. First Street and is now getting ready to join the fray on the Bowery. Yacht Club owner Andy King tells the Buzz that, despite reports elsewhere, the Yacht Club is not moving into the old Mannahatta space on Bleecker and Bowery and is instead moving to the former Kelley and Peng space at 325 Bowery (corner of 2nd St. and Bowery). He hopes to re-open in mid-March, which is right after new neighbor Bowery Electric plans to debut. Meanwhile, the old Yacht space is returning to owner Steve Tzolis (Periyali, Il Cantinori and Persephone) who plans to reopen it next week as a yet-to-be-named bar and lounge using the old Yacht Club phone number (212-777-5617). Tzolis also owned Chez Es Saada and Ludo, which inhabited the space before.

The merguez frites at Nomad The East Village's North African eatery Nomad is celebrating its second anniversary by offering merguez frites. This admittedly greasy sandwich puts spicy sausage, French fries, caramelized onions and harissa sauce between two slices of homemade bread. In France, the beloved merguez frites is commonly sold out of French snack trucks (and indeed they show up in some food carts in NYC). But Nomad says they are rarely prepared properly stateside and promises that theirs is authentic. So go see what all the fuss is about (two for $20 or one for $10).

Friedman's Delicatessen, a 50-seater at Chelsea Market, opened last Friday, despite the Times' report that it opens tomorrow. Interestingly, while it keeps kosher, it doesn't keep kosher hours: It's open on Friday and Saturday. We have an update to add to our earlier report regarding the 356 Bowery spaces that used to be Marion's and M&R Bar. Marion's will reopen in the next few weeks as Antik (not Antique), a \"semi-private\" cocktail lounge. Meanwhile downstairs, M&R Bar has become a British pub by the name of King's Cross and is in soft-opening mode. The Scotto family has set a May opening for their newest venue, another branch of Fresco on the Go, located at 10 Hanover Square in the Financial district. Designed by Studio GAIA, the 8,000-sq.-ft. space will combine elements of a retail store, restaurant and party space. Cross your fingers: eighty one, the longtime-in-the-works American from chef Ed Brown (ex Sea Grill) is now scheduled to open Monday, February 18th, at 45 W. 81st St. This May, Chelsea gets another dining option with new organic market/cafe Simple Kitchen, tucked away at 361 W. 17th Street. According to owner Lisa Underwood, the storefront will feature an array of soups, salads and sandwiches. And coming this October to 155 Varick Street is the City Winery, a wine bar and event space from Michael Dorf (the Knitting Factory) that will also have its own winery where 200 members to make their own private-label wine in their own barrels (via Brooklyn Vegan).

Former Cafe Boulud Chef Adapts to DC

***CONTENT
Bertrand Chemel (ex Café Boulud) is adapting quite nicely to his post as executive chef at 2941, a top-rated New American just outside Washington, DC, in Falls Church, VA. He says he's adding a \"French twist\" to the menu, and indeed his Gallic influence appears in the new braised beef “royale” with fresh black truffle, poached foie gras and winter root vegetables. Chemel also told the Buzz that he’s enjoying his Falls Church customers because they \"are very food conscious and like to try new things.\" Their curiosity extends to ordering the tasting menu more often than Café Boulud diners did, he adds, which suits him since that's where he can experiment with dishes like a guinea hen presentation featuring a confit of the leg, shredded and wrapped in a cabbage leaf, accompanying the roasted breast meat.- Olga Boikess

Upper West Siders looking for a different way to eat lunch and still get a bit of work done have a new option thanks to an old favorite. The Uptown branch of Pan-Asian Ruby Foo's is serving a new \"lite\" lunch menu, and by \"lite\" they mean smaller portions for lower prices (i.e. a smaller dish of pad thai is now $12 down from $16). There's also a three-course prix fixe for kids for just $7. But the biggest news for the neighborhood's ever-hungry laptop set is that Ruby Foo's now has free WiFi. Sure beats working out of a Starbucks.

Shaffer City to Become Flatiron Joes

***CONTENT
The Buzz has just learned that Shaffer City Oyster Bar & Grill will close after its final dinner service on Saturday, February 23rd. But owner Jay Shaffer is holding on to his space at 5 West 21 St. On March 2nd, he plans to open Flatiron Joes there. Some may remember Flatiron Joes from its brief stint last year down the block at 29 W. 21 St., but this new version will be different. Expect a lower price point compared to Shaffer City to go along with the new jukebox and loungey atmosphere. It will incorporate elements from both places – the famous Oyster Bar from Shaffer's will be there along with fun American fare like sliders. He's keeping Shaffer's wine list but adding lots of beers. But while the booze selection is growing, the number of seats is shrinking, as he's turning the back area into a private dining room.

***CONTENT
Over the past few months, Zagat has been teaming up with local restaurants to offer our readers special deals at places like Park Avenue Winter, Dovetail, ilili and The Smith. We've had so much success with these events that we've decided to continue them under the banner Zagat Presents. In fact, two more evenings are just around the corner: Next week, Japanese/Brazilian fusion joint Sushi Samba's West Village location is offering a custom, four-course omakase menu with sake pairings selected by the restaurant's resident sake sommelier, Monica Samuels, who will lead a sake tutorial during dinner (February 12, 7PM; $55 per person with pairings; to make a reservation call 212-691-7885 and mention \"Zagat Presents\"). The following week, diners are invited to Café Boulud to meet the restaurant's new chef de cuisine, Gavin Kaysen, who will be on hand to greet guests and share his thoughts on cooking. For one night only, Kaysen will offer our readers a special four-course prix fixe for the price of just three courses. The menu will include dishes such as black-truffle-and-pork sausage with buttermilk biscuits, quail egg and sauce périgourdine (February 19; $65 per person; to make a reservation call 212-772-2600 and mention \"Zagat Presents\").

Nightlife Changes on the Bowery

***CONTENT
As the area around the Bowery Hotel continues to transform from scary to chic, old nightspots keep closing and new ones are opening left and right. At 327 Bowery, the owners of Hi-Fi are preparing to open The Bowery Electric by the end of the month in the space that used to house the Remote Lounge, which officially closed in December after a slow death. The space reportedly has a new look, less cameras and retains the old lounge's phone number (212-228-0228). One block down, the Bowery nightspot Mannahatta has closed up shop and merged its operations with neighbor Crime Scene. Three blocks up, Marion's Marquee Lounge is now going by the name Antik. Next door, the same fine folks are turning the old M&R Bar into a pub, as yet unnamed. Finally, on First Street, a wine bar named Bowery Wine Company is set to open in the next week. It expects to be joined by a slew of other establishments in the coming months, including a sibling to the popular all-night eatery Veselka and a burger joint from Daniel Boulud.

Instead it will still reopen as an Italian wine bar in March, but now in an attempt to distance itself from the old incarnation it will be named Gambero Rosso, which translates as \"red shrimp.\"

New Jersey fans of New York's Hale & Hearty Soups need not trudge into the City anymore to get their liquid-food fix. The 21-strong chain has just opened its first outpost in the Garden State. The new 75-seat Hale & Hearty is located in Livingston and is the restaurant's first out-of-state bid since the chain was founded in 1995. It won't be the last though, as plans are already in the works for a Jersey City location to open this summer (464 Mt. Pleasant Ave., Circle Plaza Shopping Center, Livingston; 973-597-0200).

***CONTENT
Big Blue prevailed and the Patriots went home defeated at Sunday's Super Bowl, and while the ticker tape parade may be over, our gloating sure isn't. Before the big game, Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Boston's Mayor Thomas M. Menino made a friendly wager of local foods over the football game. Now it's time for New England to pay up. So what does Beantown owe the Big Apple after the Giants' 17-14 upset? No less than 100 cups of New England clam chowder from Legal Sea Foods, 42 lbs. of coffee from Dunkin' Donuts (in honor of it being the 42nd Super Bowl), 12 dozen Boston cream pies and 12 dozen Parker house rolls from Boston's Omni Parker House Hotel (in honor of Tom Brady's #12), 100 Old Tyme hot dogs and 100 al fresco chicken sausages from Kayem, 20 pizzas from Sal's, five cases of Brigham's Boston You're My Home ice cream, five cases of Cherry on the Top frozen yogurt bars from Elan and 100 servings of Stonyfield Farm Organic Yogurt. When the food arrives in New York, it will be donated to City Harvest, according to Mayor Bloomberg's office. A date for the handoff should be decided upon in the next week.

Wine Shrines Now (Adour) and Then (Oak Room)
***AUTHOR

***CONTENT
These light fixtures at Adour suggest champagne bubbles. photo: Ryan Charles Alain Ducasse’s new ode to food and wine, Adour, opened last week in the St. Regis Hotel, and its high-end, oenocentric design brings to mind another grand hotel space, the Plaza’s Oak Room. Conceived 100 years apart, both share the same aesthetic: the glorification of the grape. The 1907 Plaza version was originally a nameless, men-only barroom created by the building’s architect, Henry Hardenbergh. His German Renaissance design referenced the joy of drinking with walls of sable-dyed oak, faux wine casks carved into the woodwork and murals depicting castles on the Rhine; a grape-laden chandelier topped by a barmaid hoisting a stein sealed the deal. The room was shuttered and its long wooden bar removed following the advent of Prohibition, but otherwise looks exactly the same as on opening day. Landmarked in 2005, it’s currently closed as part of the Plaza’s overall renovation and due back on the scene sometime this spring. A century later comes Adour, also set in a turn-of-the-century hotel (the 1904 St. Regis), that’s been reimagined by designer David Rockwell, whose credits include everything from Nobu 57 to Broadway’s Hairspray. Like Hardenbergh, Rockwell venerates vino with light fixtures suggesting champagne bubbles and a carpet whose hue lies somewhere between Burgundy and Chardonnay. The marble walls are veiled by a scrim festooned with appliquéd grapes and vines, while strategically placed ‘wine armoires’ function as room dividers. Only the restaurant’s mural – a multimedia rendition of its namesake French river – deviates from the wine-centric theme. Unlike the Oak Room, Adour has its own bar, although it’s a petite, four-seat affair. To add some millennial jazz, it features an interactive menu beamed onto the bartop, yet most guests bypass it in favor of the more time-honored tradition of speaking directly to the sommelier. - Curt Gathje

A detail of \"Tom Colicchio's raised Monkfish with Pork Belly, Leeks\" photo: Diana DeLucia Here's an interesting take on the growing love affair between top chefs and photographers: pictures of the food itself. Top toques such as Lidia Bastianich, Daniel Boulud, Tom Colicchio, Larry Forgione, Johnny Iuzzini, François Payard, Eric Ripert and Laurent Tourondel have all agreed to let Diana DeLucia, publisher of New York Restaurant Insider, photograph their culinary creations. These appetizing 27-in.-by-33-in. photos – including Tom Colicchio's \"Braised Monkfish with Pork Belly, Leeks & Cabbage\" (pictured above) and Jean-Georges Vongerichten's \"Yellowfin Tuna Ribbons, Avocado, Spicy Radish, Ginger Marinade\" – are up for online auction through February 24th. The minimum bid for a photo is $250, and it's $950 to purchase it outright. The proceeds from the auction will be donated to City Harvest. Before the winning bidders get them though, the pictures will be on display in a show called \"Photography for Philanthropy\" that's tied to the International Restaurant & Foodservice Show of New York, which will be at the Javits Center on March 9–11.

***CONTENT
Tre dici, the neighborhood Chelsea Italian, is putting its former private dining room to good use. It's turning the second-floor space into tre dici STEAK – and dressing it up like an old-fashioned New Orleans parlour with a bawdy twist. Opening on February 12th, this 50-seater will serve classic chophouse fare like a 16-oz. New York strip steak ($26) as well as more innovative dishes such as Kobe-beef ravioli ($21). The two restaurants will share a kitchen – with tre dici STEAK's food arriving via dumbwaiter – but not an entrance (128 W. 26th St.).

Even though the New York French restaurant La Caravelle closed up shop in 2004, its champagne lives on. The restaurant started producing its own Premier Cru back in 1997 and the bubbly still does some brisk business ten years later. On Friday, to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the drink, Caravelle owner Rita Jammet is going to be on hand for an informal tasting at Morrell Wine (3:30–6 PM; One Rockefeller Plaza; 212-688-9370). [via Snack] While you're there, be sure to hold your glass by the stem, as the expert to whom the Buzz spoke last month regarding the importance of drinking champagne out of a flute reminded us.

Of the recent closings around New York, here are some that Zagat Buzz has confirmed: As we mentioned earlier, after ten years Rock Center has said goodbye to its bid at rustic Italian fare, Tuscan Square. Across town on the East side, Doherty's Pub on 52nd has poured its last beer. Back on the West side, the tiny Middle Eastern Ellyssa on Ninth Avenue has closed up shop. And Dimple Indian on West 30th has met a similar fate. Tiny Italian flat-bread shop Daniele's Piadina, on West 22nd, is finished and is now Ashby's. Then further downtown, Puff & Pao on Christopher street has given up the ghost, as has El Portal on Allen Street. Finally, the 2nd Street Cafe in Park Slope is finished.

Those still in mourning over last year's loss of Dona, the short-lived Donatella Arpaia and Michael Psilakis (Anthos) Greek-infused Italian restaurant that was forced to close after its home was sold to a developer, have reason to rejoice. The pair is getting ready to open Mia Dona, a sequel of sorts. This new eatery will maintain its predecessor's quirky spins on traditional Italian standards like homemade pasta, but also branches out with dishes like crispy rabbit and meatloaf with an eight-minute egg inside. The new space also echoes the original with touches like zebra-print carpet and Fornasetti plates. Mia Dona is expected to open on, or soon after, February 14 (206 E. 58th St.; 212-750-8170).

Get Your Super Bowl Party in Order

***CONTENT
With the Super Bowl getting closer and closer, the hunt is on to figure out where exactly to watch the Giants defeat the Patriots. Many will stake out a good seat at NYC's dozens of great sports bars. ESPN Zone, for instance, is expecting dedicated fans to start lining up the night before. But that doesn't mean there isn't another way. You can enjoy a great party at your home (or at a friend's) by having a top-notch restaurant cater the event. Here are a few noteworthy offerings: If you're looking to serve your guests something with foodie cred, the beloved Momofuku Ssäm Bar is offering to stuff your party on bo ssäm, chicken wings, kewpie cole slaw and desserts ($30 per person; call 212-254-3500x109 to order). For something really different, Trestle on Tenth is cooking crispy duck necks. Braised, fried with bread crumbs and served with a garlic-and-anchovy sauce, necks are certainly a departure from the usual buffalo wings that show up on game day (12 necks for $16; available for pick-up from noon until 8 PM; 212-645-5659). If a top-toque catered affair is more up your alley, David Burke at Bloomingdale's is offering a wide range of his signature party dishes, including \"CheeseBurker\" sliders, \"Burke in the Box\" thin-crust pizzas, smoked-ham mac 'n' cheese fritters and much more (212-705-3800). All three outposts of Rosa Mexicano are selling \"guac to go\" kits. Including homemade tortilla chips, jars of Rosa Mexicano salsas, and of course their well-known guacamole, this package should be an easy crowd pleaser ($36.95 for five guests, $109.95 for 20; 212-533-3350). And if BBQ is your thing, well, you've got a lot of options. Blue Smoke, Daisy May's BBQ USA, Georgia’s Eastside BBQ, Rack & Soul, Smoke Joint and Virgil’s Real Barbecue are all offering home catering deals. Check with each restaurant for more information.

If you couldn't get a reservation at Le Cirque during Restaurant Week, you're getting a second chance at its bargain-priced meal. The ever-popular Le Cirque has found such success with its Restaurant Week menu (PDF) that it's going to hold onto it for another month. Diners looking for an affordable taste of the French fare at Sirio Maccioni’s infamous eatery will have all of February weekdays to partake in grilled Branzino with pommes dauphine and mixed vegetables, chestnut pappardelle with veal-and-wild-mushroom ragout and more for the reasonable price of $24.07 for lunch (sadly, the dinner deal is not being extended). Reservations still won't be easy to come by, but at least you have four more weeks to try. And of course, if you still haven't gotten around to enjoying Restaurant Week itself it isn't too late! As you can see from our special Restaurant Week landing page, you still have many options. Get dining!

Of the recent closings around New York, here are some that Zagat has confirmed: Tuscan Square, Rockefeller Center's 10-year-old Italian, is saying its final ciaos. Its last day of business will be this Saturday. In the outer boroughs, Park Slope lost its Seventh Avenue Mediterranean staple Laila's. Rouge, on 70th Road in Forest Hills, has met a similar fate. Uptown, Harlem said goodbye to another BBQ joint: Oklahoma Smoke BBQ on West 145th Street. Carne on the Upper West Side is also gone, replaced by a restaurant called Toast. And over on the East Side, Haikara Grill on East 63rd is now a restaurant called Smokin' Q. In Hell's Kitchen, Ninth Avenue's Xing and Pozzo Pastry Shop have both given up the ghost. Meanwhile downtown, Greenwich Village Japanese Okinawa on Laguardia Place has been replaced by Five Guys; HQ on Thompson Street in SoHo is down for the count; and the Roadhouse on Murray Street has gotten a new name, A&M Roadhouse, and moved down the street into the space recently occupied by Murray Street Grill. Finally, a few chain branches have recently shuttered including the West 23rd Street branch of Ben & Jerry's; the MacDougal Street branch of La Palette; and the West 47th Street branch of Raku-It's Japanese!

South Gate, the forthcoming restaurant from chef Kerry Heffernan (ex Eleven Madison Park), is preparing for an early February bow in the Jumeirah Essex House on Central Park South. According to the restaurant's maitre d', its reservation line will open early next week, when it will begin taking bookings for February 8th and beyond. In an interview with the Buzz back in mid-December, Heffernan said his new project would feature New American fare \"cooked in traditional and soulful ways\" and an \"enormous new perspective on the Park.\" The anticipated eatery will be taking over the old Cafe Botanica phone number (212-484-5120), which should be up and running by Tuesday.

Calorie Counts Coming to City Fast Food Spots

***CONTENT
The New York City Department of Health has made another move to force fast food purveyors to provide honest health information up front. After an earlier set of rules was struck down by a federal judge, the DoH regrouped and yesterday passed new provisions that require any chain operating at least 15 outlets nationwide to put calorie counts on menus and anywhere else customers might pick their food from. These new regulations are being put in place to help combat the ongoing obesity epidemic. As the notice of adoption (PDF) points out, in \"New York City, obesity prevalence has increased by more than 70% in the past decade. More than half (54%) of New York City adults are overweight or obese, and 1 in every 5 adults is obese; 43% of elementary school children are overweight or obese.\" The DoH argues that the fight against fat needs to fall squarely on establishments as even trained professionals often have trouble estimating caloric content. A recent poll found that only 11% of adults could correctly identify which of the four breakfast choices from Denny’s Restaurants had the fewest calories and which of the four menu items from McDonald’s had the most calories. Of course, many restaurants aren't happy about the new rules (about 10% of the city's restaurants will be affected). Displaying nutritional information may be embarrassing for some chains (Burger King, for instance, may not like explaining why their cheeseburger has only 330 calories while the Whopper Junior with cheese has 410 calories and the Triple Whopper with cheese has 1,230). The DoH is hoping that rather than risk humiliation, many chains will retool or even drop menu items. Though it is unlikely that this fight is over, assuming the new provisions aren't challenged again by a group like the New York State Restaurant Association, which sued the last time, they are set to go into effect March 31.

City-Suburban SmackDown!

***CONTENT
By Erik Badia Seeing Double: BLT Steak recently opened an upscale Westchester outpost. Suburbanites might have the big backyards, but city dwellers get all the big-deal restaurants, right? While Levittown and the like aren't about to overtake Gotham's dining scene any time soon, a spate of new suburban hot spots suggest that commuters have a lot more to go home to than open space these days. Last month, Laurent Tourondel's BLT Steak opened an urbane outpost in Westchester's brand-new White Plains Ritz-Carlton (221 Main St., White Plains; 914-467-5500). The luxe hotel is also home to 42, a swank New American eatery that reportedly cost close to $20 million to build and features, according to a press release, \"all the bells and whistles usually associated with a New York City restaurant opening\" (One Renaissance Sq., White Plains; 914-761-4242). Even Nobu seems to be doing some suburban house-hunting, debuting a seasonal \"pop-up\" eatery in East Hampton last summer that drew the usual cast of celebs. Of course, outposts of city staples like Peter Luger and Il Mulino have been serving their signature dishes to suburbanites for years now. Which begs the question: Are these sibs more than mere copycats? The Buzz took a look at a handful of popular NYC restaurants and their country cousins to see how they measure up. Bistro Cassis This popular French bistro debuted in Long Island's Huntington Village in 2001 where its no-reservations policy soon resulted in long weekend waits for tables. In 2004, Bistro Cassis reverse-migrated into the city, opening a branch on Manhattan's Upper West Side. Survey Says: Taking on the New York dining scene is a gutsy move, and while it appears to have paid off (surveyors report long waits at the Columbus Avenue locale), ratings suggest that Gotham foodies feel there’s some room for improvement, especially in the service. Blue Hill In 2004, Dan Barber took Blue Hill's fresh, organic New American fare to new heights by partnering with David Rockefeller to open Blue Hill at Stone Barns in Westchester's Pocantico Hills. Set on a working organic farm, it features a choice of seasonal three-, four- and seven-course menus – the latter fittingly dubbed the \"Farmer's Feast.\" Survey Says: While the original has a cult foodie following, it's hard to beat the suburban spin-off's beautiful bucolic setting. And since it's situated on a farm, the food couldn't be any fresher. Il Mulino Nestled in the heart of Greenwich Village, this longtime Italian favorite is known for its top-notch cooking, white-glove service and tough-to-score tables. Its sister restaurant, located on busy Northern Boulevard in Roslyn, Long Island, opened in 2004. Survey Says: This one's a tough call. The same signature dishes – fresh Dover sole meunière, rack of lamb with Dijon mustard glaze and double cut veal chop with sage and garlic – can be had at either location, with the Roslyn outpost boasting Sunday service, as well as later weekend dining hours. But no matter which one you choose, you'll still have to book prime weekend tables at least two weeks in advance. Peter Luger This classic New York chophouse opened for business at the base of the Williamsburg Bridge in 1887 – and has yet to be dethroned as Zagat's number-one rated steakhouse. Its Great Neck spin-off, meanwhile, features different decor and a more varied and extensive menu (think chicken and lobster) – though everyone still comes for the porterhouse. Survey Says: Having been open for close to 50 years, the Long Island location is a classic in its own right, and its popularity is reflected in its long reservation waits, which require several weeks notice for prime weekend tables. Sfoglia Opened on the serene isle of Nantucket in 2000, this Italian trattoria features rustic, homestyle fare crafted from local ingredients, including fresh North Atlantic seafood. The NYC outpost, which debuted in 2006, also showcases an intensely seasonal menu, mostly sourced from the Greenmarket. Survey Says: The tiny Upper East Side outpost has been a hit since Day One – no wonder scoring a seat is such a competitive sport. For more elbow room, the original can't be beat.

Geisha is making special chocolate truffles for Valentine’s Day. photo: Geisha Sure, you can celebrate Valentine's Day with a romantic dinner on February 14th, but if chocolate is what you really crave, why not consider these options? At Geisha on the Upper East Side, pastry chef Kathleen Grosch is hard at work creating a set of special chocolates just in time for Valentine's Day. Served in a red bento box ($10), the hand-made truffles are crafted from organic teas and chocolates and must be ordered at the start of the meal. Or skip dinner altogether: Geisha is selling special orders of a slightly larger green bento box for take-out ($12.50); call 212-813-1112 for more information. For a more extravagant chocolate adventure, head downtown to Rise on the 14th floor of the Battery Park Ritz-Carlton, which is being transformed into an elaborate chocolate bar on Friday and Saturday nights through March (plus the 14th, natch). The more than 22 desserts created by pastry chef Laurent Richard will include a chocolate peanut butter cup with apricot sauce; chocolate banana fondant and marquise; chocolate sabayon and caramelized pineapple martini; chocolate apricot Jell-O; toffee chocolate molten cake with banana walnut ice cream and much more (Fridays and Saturdays from February 1–March 1, plus February 14; seatings at 6:30, 8:30 and 10:30 PM; $75 per person; reservations required at 917-790-2600). And on a related note, did you know that a little bit of chocolate each day can be good for lowering your blood pressure?

Lean Times for the Meatpacking District

***CONTENT
Uneasy Street: Gansevoort and Washington photo: Emily Capo The new year is off with a thud in the Meatpacking District, with a slew of closings both real and rumored. The downturn began with last year's shuttering of Markt, probably the most populist (and popular) venue in the high-flying neighborhood, which was razed to make way for an Apple Store. This month, the nightclub PM went dark after its liquor license was suspended, and word is it won't reopen at all. There's a similarly uncertain future for the Inn LW12, currently \"closed for renovations\" and also alleged to be gone for good. Across the street, the Japanese restaurant Ono is set to fold in March (to be replaced by a Maxim magazine–branded steakhouse), while long-reported plans to transpose former hotspot Double Seven to Gansevoort Street have also been scuttled. It's all part of the roller-coaster ride that is the Meatpacking District, a once gritty industrial zone that became a dining/clubbing destination in 2000 following the opening of Lotus, the \"it\" club of the millennium. Soon the district was drawing big-name chefs (Jean-Georges Vongerichten, Zak Pellacio, Sue Torres), big-name restaurateurs (Jeffrey Chodorow, Steve Hanson, Keith McNally), a swell hotel (the Gansevoort) and every kind of nightlife imaginable from dive bars to boutique lounges. But even during the boom times, one street seemed jinxed – the stretch of Gansevoort between 9th and Washington, where most of the current closings are clustered. Over the last eight years, this strip has seen one major flameout (Sascha) as well as a number of lesser ones (Chinghalle, Hell, Meet, Rhône, Zitoune). Still, there's some hope for this unlucky block. Los Dados, a newish Mexican cantina is gamely holding down the fort on its western perimeter, and Merkato 55, Marcus Samuelsson’s new African eatery, is on the way. And when in doubt, there's always Florent, the circa-1985 granddaddy of the boulevard, where you can still get a hamburger and a martini at 5 AM. – Curt Gathje

Sette is set to become a wine bar. photo: NYCRestaurant.com Chelsea Italian Sette is joining the city's wine bar craze. According to its owner, Enrico Malta, the restaurant will close on January 20th for renovations that will make it more casual and vino-friendly. When it reopens – hopefully after three weeks in mid-February – it will be transformed into an Italian wine bar called Sette Vino. Along with the new name, there will be wine-dispensing cruvinets at the bar and a communal table, plus a menu of panini, pasta, pizza and small plates. Diners looking for old Sette standards like fish, chicken or steak will be directed next door to Malta's other Italian, Il Bastardo. During Sette's renovation, Il Bastardo will transform the old private space in back (between Il Bastardo and Sette) into an additional dining room, which should be ready in time for Sette's reopening.

Of the recently shuttered restaurants and nightspots around town, here are those that Zagat has confirmed: As reported elsewhere, Williamsburg pulled-pork favorite Pies-n-Thighs is being forced to close up shop thanks to the Department of Health. But don't worry, the gals in charge are hoping to reopen in a new location soon enough. Back in Manhattan, the Upper East Side's Agata & Valentina on First Avenue has given up the ghost as has Da Antonio on East 55th Street. Further down, Sichuan Palace on East 44th Street is no more and is in the process of being replaced by newcomer Padre Figlio. In the East Village, Good Dog on St. Marks Place has officially shut its doors, while Le Tableau on East 5th Street has done the same and is now Seymour Burton. Finally, these two nightspots called it a day: Luna Park, off Union Square, and Stereo on West 29th Street.

Remembering Restaurant Week Misfires

What are your best and worst Restaurant Week experiences? Let us know on the Zagat Discussion boards! The budget-minded food connoisseur's best friend, Restaurant Week can also occasionally be a letdown. Suddenly flush with crowds looking for a deal, eateries don't always put their best face forward. On the Zagat Discussion boards, there have been a number of stories shared about Restaurant Weeks past, and while most praise the experience, a few weren't so lucky. With Winter Restaurant Week approaching, we thought it might be a good time to review some of those misfires. Hands down, the number one problem seems to be gruff service. Take the Zagat member who lost her reservation at one restaurant after informing the maitre d', a day early, that she would no longer be a four-person party. \"They told me they would have to cancel my reservation because they were overbooked for 'twos' but we could come and take our chances for a table at the bar. I was passed to the manager who proceeded to tell me they were running a business and had to 'maximize' their available space, but if we came early, they would 'make every attempt' to seat us.\" The couple ended up going elsewhere. At least they didn't kick her out. That's what one Zagat member reports after trying to land a table at one of the hotter gastronomic temples in town: \"Called in the morning for a reservation that evening and was told they were full up but would put me on a waiting list. That evening we were passing by and dropped in – maybe something opened up. I gave my name to the maitresse d' – she checked her book and said – follow me – and escorted us upstairs and seated us. I figured they had an opening and took me from the waiting list. We order a glass of wine – which they brought and proceeded to order our meal. We were sipping our wine when the maitresse d' appeared – she had a couple behind her. She told us we would have to leave the restaurant immediately – that we had no reservation – offered no apology or nothing – just leave. As we left we learned that our name was very similar to another reservation – but not the same.\" Of course, for every Restaurant Week downer, there are several stories praising restaurants for treating diners like \"big spenders\" who are \"every bit as important to them as their regular customers.\" Have you had a wonderful or terrible Restaurant Week experience? Share it on the Zagat Discussion boards!

Seymour Burton's casual East Village digs photo: Noah Kalina At Seymour Burton, new owners are slowly remaking the East Village’s erstwhile Le Tableau as a casual bistro, ushering in a fresh, frequently changing roster of New American dishes, some with a Jewish slant (latkes, babka, etc.), but holding on to the old place’s friendly vibe; one long communal table now dominates the room, leading all the way back to the open kitchen. 511 E.

Trestle on Tenth is going Swiss for Metzgete. photo: Noah Kalina With the holidays over and the rest of winter to get through (occasional bursts of warm weather notwithstanding), a person can start to get homesick. What to do? If you own a restaurant you can share your family's culinary traditions, which is exactly what Ralf Kuettel, Swiss native and chef-owner of Trestle on Tenth, is doing. For five days, Kuettel is bringing the traditional Swiss Metzgete to Chelsea. A celebration of the harvest, Metzgete (also a bicycle race) generally involves using up every scrap left over from the annual pig slaughter. For Trestle's take on the event, diners will have the chance to chow down on braised pork belly, homemade bratwurst, liver sausage and boudin noir galore, all served with sauerkraut, mashed potatoes, apple sauce and homemade mustard (January 15–20; $24 per person, available as a single serving or family style; 212-645-5659).

Of the recently shuttered restaurants and nightspots around town, here are those that Zagat has confirmed: Greenwich Village said goodbye to its branch of the Beard Papa Sweets Cafe on Carmine Street. Over on Greenwich Avenue, the little Italian Sapore has shut its doors. Down in TriBeCa, Reade Street's DeLuxe has closed and is soon to reopen as Forge. In SoHo, Dani on Hudson Street has given up the ghost. And Gin Lane on West 14th Street is no longer in operation.

Eric Ripert photo: Nigel Parry Philly's hotly anticipated restaurant from celebrated chef Eric Ripert (Le Bernardin) now has a name. The top toque is set to open 10 Arts – a riff on its address at 10 S. Avenue of the Arts – in the Philadelphia Ritz-Carlton this spring, as previously noted in the Buzz. Despite its location in the Ritz's grand lobby, whose soaring 140-ft. ceiling is modeled on the Pantheon in Rome, the restaurant will be relatively casual, offering a Regional American menu that will focus on local ingredients.

As we reported earlier, Danal, the East Village French/Med, has been forced to move across town to a new home on lower Fifth Avenue. But never fear, it will return sooner than expected. In fact, the new Danal opens to the public this Thursday (59 Fifth Avenue; 212-982-6930). Meanwhile, a source confirms to the Buzz that at the end of the month the oddly monikered New American dessert bar p*ong will be renamed p*ong & Batch in honor of a new expansion into a space next door, which will house an attached retail bakery. We'll let you know more details as they come. Finally, Home on Cornelia Street has a new owner, who is closing it for renovations in February to reopen anew in March. Same name, same chef as before.

Batali-Branded Steaks Headed to Vegas

***CONTENT
Less then a year after opening two new restaurants in Vegas (that would be the Venetian's B&B Ristorante and Enoteca San Marco), Molto Mario and his business partner Joe Bastianich are at it again. As part of the opening celebrations at the new Palazzo Hotel (3265 Las Vegas Blvd.; 702-607-4300), just next door to the Venetian, comes the pair's newest concept, an Italian steakhouse called Carnevino. Though the Palazzo officially opens its doors to the public on January 17th, Carnevino will begin service in its 16-ft.-high ceilinged dining room two days after, on January 19th (a smidge later than has been reported elsewhere). Las Vegas, of course, is already home to steakhouses from Tom Colicchio, Charlie Palmer and Emeril Lagasse, among others. Batali hopes to stand out from the pack by putting an Italian spin on the proceedings, with handmade pastas and classic antipasti supplementing the chops. There will also be an international wine list – a first for the Batali-Bastianich team – and, in a nod to the pedigreed meat trend, \"a special brand of organic super prime beef developed exclusively by the B and B group.\"

The Hot Seat: Bar Boulud's tasting table photo: Ryan Charles Daniel Boulud goes casual at his new UWS French wine bar, Bar Boulud, a stripped-down, tablecloth-free affair with a vaulted ceiling, oak furniture and Rorschach-esque wine-stain artwork that all allude to the glories of the grape and the wine-making tradition; the vino list, drawn mainly from Burgundy and the Rhône Valley, is paired with rustic bistro items, although gourmands are buzzing about the artisanally made charcuterie on offer that’s rarely found in NY (think fromage de tête, seven-hour braised lamb terrine); a unique tasting table in the round, three private rooms downstairs and across-the-street proximity to Lincoln Center seal the deal. 1900 Broadway; 212-595-0303 See a Menu See More Photos

Turn Your Drinking Problem Into Stuff

***CONTENT
Who doesn't have the Cheers dream of having a local watering hole \"where everybody knows your name?\" Problem is, in a city like New York it takes long hours and a strong liver to become a regular bar patron recognized by staff and clientele alike. But one bar in Brooklyn is trying to make the process easier, or at least a bit more fun. One of several new bars to open recently on the same stretch of Fourth Avenue, beer hall Pacific Standard has instituted a Frequent Drinker Membership program to cultivate a loyal base. For a mere $10, bar flies get their very own ID card (\"At the time of payment, you may either choose a drawing of you fighting a whaleshark riding an Abrams tank with nothing but your bulging muscles and a harpoon-like device, or a picture of you in a field with various cute creatures\") and the ability to cash in on \"Frequent Drinker Yards\" (racking up a \"yard\" for every dollar spent at the bar). Like the frequent flier programs that inspired the Standard, its drinker program lets members cash in their yards for prizes – from a year-long membership to the Film Forum (1500 yards) to a private keg party (4000 yards). Our favorite? A fabulous trip in which \"Pacific Standard will pay for a subway ride to glorious Williamsburg, a $20 bar tab at Barcade, and $50 towards dinner at the amazing Fette Sau,\" all for a mere 1400 yards. You can check out the full list of prizes here.

A quick clarification of a recent closings post: While indeed the East Village's beloved Danal has shut its East 10th Street doors, the French/Med restaurant isn't down for the count. As we noted way back in October, it is in fact just moving across town to 59 Fifth Avenue, south of 13th Street. Unfortunately for the restaurant, renovations on the new venue have taken longer than anticipated, and so the original location had to be closed before the new one was ready. But when the new bilevel space is complete, we promise to let you know.

Zak Pelaccio (Fatty Crab) is the consulting chef at Chop Suey, a new Southeast Asian eatery opening January 17th on the second floor of the Renaissance Times Square, where it replaces Foley's Fish House. Its menu will emphasize Korean dishes (714 Seventh Ave.; 212-765-7676). Despite reports to the contrary, Merkato 55, Marcus Samuelsson's latest, will not be readied until at least the third week of January. The Meatpacking District newcomer will explore African cooking and its influences on the cuisines of the world and borrows its name from a food market in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia (55-61 Gansevoort St.). One of the most anticipated openings of the season is Adour, Alain Ducasse's wine-centric project debuting in the St. Regis on January 28th. It will offer cooking by chef Tony Esnault (who helmed the kitchen at Ducasse's eponymous Essex House venture) and an \"interactive\" wine bar (2 E. 55th St.; 212-710-2277). When the Buzz spoke to Kerry Heffernan last November about South Gate, his forthcoming New American in the Jumeirah Essex House, the former Eleven Madison Park toque whet appetites with talk about its \"extraordinary wine list,\" \"traditional and soulful\" fare and \"enormous new perspective on [Central] Park.\" Fans will finally see for themselves in early February (154 Central Park S.; 212-247-0300). February will also see the arrival of Cognac, the new Midtown brasserie from the folks behind Serafina and Geisha featuring a cocktail bar, cheese bar, private dining room with fireplace and bakery (1740 Broadway).

A bit of New Orleans is coming to Mas. One of the Big Easy's big culinary guns is coming to town. On Sunday, January 13th, Bob Iacovone, of New Orlean's top Zagat-rated Creole eatery Cuvée, is coming to New York to cook for the hungry patrons at mas (which, you might remember, recently expanded). Chef Iacovone is in the city to shoot an episode of Iron Chef America, and will be dropping by the Greenwich Village New American for a reunion with chef-owner Galen Zamarra, his friend and CIA co-alumna. For his one-night-only appearance, Iacovone will prepare a four-course tasting menu, the details of which are still to be determined (January 13, 6–11 PM; $79 per person, not including drinks, tax or gratuity; reservations recommended; 212-255-1790).

The spread at Bar Boulud's opening night party included a tree hung with saucisson. photo: Nina Zagat Le tout New York was in attendance at last night's party celebrating the opening of Bar Boulud, Daniel Boulud's new wine bar across the street from Lincoln Center. Leave it to Boulud to have the svelte microgreen-weaned set clamoring for sauccison made from ham and fatback. Already Topic A in the foodie blogosphere, Bar Boulud's housemade charcuterie was served to guests while they sipped wines from Burgundy and the Rhône in its elegant, minimalist setting (click here to view photos of the space). The charcuterie program is overseen by Gilles Verot protégé Sylvain Gasdon, who crafts everything from the aforementioned Saucisson Sec de Lyon (air-dried sausage hung for a minimum of one month) to Fromage de Tête \"Gilles Verot\" (a terrine made from pig's head). Of course, the less adventurous can always tuck into the seasonal bistro menu featuring Boulud's spins on standards like steak frites and coq au vin. Bar Boulud officially opens to the public on January 8th. While walk-ins are welcome, pre-theater reservations are strongly recommended (1900 Broadway; 212-595-0303).

New Jersey diners have a reason to get excited: the fourth annual Hudson Restaurant Week is fast approaching. Running from January 28th to February 8th, the promotion lets diners in Hoboken, Jersey City and Union City get out and explore their local eateries without breaking the bank. The prix fixe lunches start at $13 and dinners at $23. And this year there are even more participating restaurants, including Azúcar, Gaslight, Madison Bar & Grill, Park Avenue Bar & Grill and many more. A full list of participating restaurants is available here, and don't forget to come back to ZAGAT.com to read reviews and book your tables. Also, be careful making your reservations – not all of the eateries involved are continuing the Restaurant Week prices during the weekend (but you'll be watching the Super Bowl anyway, right?).

Of the recently shuttered restaurants and nightspots around town, here are some notable closings that Zagat has confirmed: First reported on Eater, the Meatpacking District has said goodbye to the old-school Frank's. Open for nearly a century, the Italian steakhouse moved a half-block to its last home in the Chelsea Market in 2005, where it had trouble attracting customers to its interior location. Uptown, as part of the ongoing renovations of The Pierre, the hotel's restaurant, Cafe Pierre, has been shuttered. And over on Third Avenue and 78th Street, New American Annie's has vacated its premises. Moving downtown, Jeffery Chodorow's ambitious fish house Wild Salmon closed for good after New Year's Eve. Meanwhile, the Flatiron District said so long to Bobby Flay's Bolo. Finally, after 20 years, beloved French/Med Danal will no longer be serving brunches (or any other meals) in its 10th Street space.

Gordon Ramsay The British are coming, the British are coming... to Hollywood. This April the old Bel Age hotel is set to reopen its doors as The London West Hollywood (1020 N. San Vicente Blvd; 1-866-282-4560). And like its East Coast sib the London NYC, its glittering star will be a restaurant from British chef and TV personality Gordon Ramsay, his first on the West Coast. Like its New York counterpart, Ramsay's LA venture will be home to his signature New French cuisine, this time inspired by California's famous fresh produce. How will Ramsay fare in the Hills? Despite a recent slew of imports, the track record of out-of-town chefs in LA has been spotty. While similarly successful TV toque Tom Colicchio's Craft has performed well, its business is boosted by its walking distance from both the CAA and ICM agencies. And Ramsay will have high-class competition coming from another import, Laurent Tourondel's BLT Steak, which is about to make its West Coast debut on the trendiest segment of the Sunset Strip (8720 Sunset Blvd.). Of course, if Ramsay's new restaurant doesn't work, fixing it will at least make for an excellent episode of his FOX reality show, Kitchen Nightmares.

2008 is shaping up to be a stellar vintage year. At least for New Yorkers, who will soon have two wine bars from a pair of powerhouse chefs in which to sip and swirl. First up is Daniel Boulud's boîte across the street from Lincoln Center. Opening January 8th (though it played host to a posh New Year's Eve bash), Bar Boulud will offer a serious food-and-wine program even if it is casual by Boulud standards (walk-ins are welcome). A minimalist interpretation of a wine cellar (click here to view photos), the setting will notably feature private dining rooms and a \"tasting table in the round\" that holds up to 14 guests. Expect a rustic bistro menu fit for an opera tenor, paired with a list emphasizing Burgundy and Rhône bottles (1900 Broadway; 212-595-0303). Wine will also play an integral role at Adour, Alain Ducasse's American entry debuting in the St. Regis on January 28th. Housed in the storied space that was Lespinasse, it will offer cooking by chef Tony Esnault (who helmed the kitchen at Ducasse's eponymous Essex House venture), private tasting rooms and an \"interactive\" wine bar (2 E. 55th St.; 212-710-2277).

Downtown pierogi fans, Merry Christmas. Grub Street has just gotten confirmation that Veselka, the East Village's beloved 24-hour Ukrainian eatery, has signed a lease for another space, at 9 East First Street between the Bowery and Second Avenue. Located inside of the Avalon Christie development that brought Whole Foods to Houston Street, the new restaurant will be just down the block from Daniel Boulud's forthcoming burger joint (once rumored to be named DBGB after the legendary, now defunct punk club that lived around the corner, CBGB) and only eight blocks from the original Veselka. The new restaurant will be the second satellite of the Ukrainian staple, which also runs a kiosk at First Park at First Street and First Avenue.

Nothing can stop Laurent Tourondel. Just weeks after opening a BLT Steak in Dallas, the chef and mastermind behind the BLT empire has opened another branch of his signature steakhouse. And this time, he's sticking close to home and setting up shop in Westchester. Just opened inside the brand-new Ritz-Carlton Westchester, the newest BLT Steak mirrors the original in New York with its upscale setting catering to VIPs. And it isn't the only new restaurant debuting in the enormous 44-story Ritz-Carlton towers. New Year's Eve will see the debut of 42, named after the floor it is located on, from chef Anthony Gonçalves (Trotters, nka Peniche). 221 Main St., White Plains; 914-467-5500

Christmas rituals vary greatly from family to family. While some celebrate around a tree, some, especially those who aren't Christian, go out to eat. And historically, they eat Chinese. In fact, for many who associate December 25th with light traffic and a TV yule log, the Christmas Chinese feast is a cherished ritual. And so, not wanting to leave anyone out of our holiday coverage, the Buzz called the Top Chinese restaurants in Manhattan to come up with the following list of restaurants open for business on the holiday: Tse Yang Oriental Garden Shun Lee Palace Mr. K's Tang Pavilion

Feasts of the Seven Fishes

***CONTENT
For an Italian twist on the Christmas Eve dinner, the famous Feast of the Seven Fishes (or La Vigilia) can't be beat. Traditionally consisting of at least seven seafood courses, the epic meal varies from home to home and restaurant to restaurant. But because of its elaborate premise, it has long been a favorite for chefs to play with. Here are a few restaurants still taking reservations for the feast: Barbuto: Chef Jonathan Waxman brings a market-driven approach to his prix fixe repast that includes risotto with sweet Maine shrimp and Umbrian black truffles and roasted striped bass with Meyer lemon and sunchokes (5:30–midnight; $60 per person; 212-924-9700). Gonzo: This Greenwich Village Italian is offering more than seven different forms of seafood (not to mention dessert) in a meal that includes cold seafood salad, baked clams, sauteed mussels, grilled salmon, prosciutto-wrapped diver scallops and more (5:30–10 PM; $60 per person; 212-645-4606). Gusto: Chef Amanda Freitag's rendition includes grilled baby octopus, spicy shellfish soup, hollow spaghetti with sardines, pan-seared tuna and a frozen orange and lemon mousse (noon–11PM; $75 per person, $115 with wine pairings; 212-924-8000). Otto Enoteca: Mario Batali's casual Italian eatery is serving an antipasti version of the feast from now through the new year. Served on a large platter, it includes baccala salad, orata pickled in white wine vinegar, baked semolina-dusted king fish, marinated eel and poached shrimp in basil pesto (11:30 AM–midnight; $32 per person; 212-995-9559).

Belcourt is one of many that will be open for brunch on New Year's Day. photo: Noah Kalina After all of the festivities of New Year's Eve, all that we ask for of New Year's Day is a good brunch to settle our stomach (and maybe a strong drink to steady our head). Lucky for us, many of New York's best bruncheries are going to be open on the first day of the year, including newcomers like the East Village's Belcourt, which is pushing its spicy tripe soup with Parmesan cheese ($6) as the cure for your hangover. However, to help you avoid disappointment in 2008, we called a number of the big brunch joints around town to see who will be open and, just as important, who will be closed. These places will be open for brunch on New Year's Day: Artisanal Aquagrill Atlantic Grill Blue Water Grill Balthazar Belcourt Bubby's TriBeCa Bubby's Dumbo Cafe Un Deux Trois Cafeteria Carlyle DuMont Essex Gemma Good Enough To Eat Isabella's Jojo L'express Norma's Ocean Grill Odeon Pastis River Cafe Sarabeth's on 80th Sarabeth's on 92nd Sarabeth's on Central Park South Schiller's And here are a few brunch biggies that are not open on New Year's Day: Felix Five Points Prune Sarabeth’s on 75th

By Stephanie Blanco The pizza is free with every drink purchase at the Alligator Lounge. photo: Grace Kang via flickr There may not be such a thing as a free lunch in this town, but you can eat something for nothing if you know where to go. Ok, it might cost you more than nothing – most of the below spots ask that you at least buy a drink – but you'll be rewarded with little extras like fancy bar snacks, chocolate-chip cookies, even homemade Stollen to take home. Alligator Lounge: This Williamsburg dive is one of the original free-pizza-with-every-drink bars (along with siblings the Crocodile Lounge and the late Capone's). That’s right, order a pint of beer or other alcoholic beverage, and you get a free pizza – not a slice, but a personal pie. Only the cheese pizza is complimentary, but at $2 a topping, it’s still a good value. dell’anima: This new West Village cocktail lounge features an afternoon apertivo hour, when you can snack on free Italian vittles like olives and salads while sipping Dale DeGroff–designed cocktails (Thursday–Saturday, 4–6 PM). Ditch Plains: Named for a Long Island surfing spot, chef Marc Murphy’s Greenwich Village ode to seafood shacks gives saltwater taffy to diners as a parting gift to help keep the seashore vibe alive. Hank’s Saloon: Enjoy free barbecue at this dive bar in Boerum Hill where there is live entertainment every day of the week. Sunday night is barbecue night – no cover charge, no nothing (Sundays, around 10 PM). Home: This welcoming American eatery has been giving free chocolate-chip cookies to its customers since it opened in the Village 15 years ago. Il Giglio: After being seated at this TriBeCa Tuscan, diners are served free appetizers, including marinated zucchini, bruschetta and cheese, to start the meal off right. Ithaka: Diners expect a free dessert at this Greek Upper Eastsider – and they don't leave disappointed thanks to the gratis loukoumades, best described as Greek-style doughnuts, made with flour, yeast, honey and a little cinnamon. Mermaid Inn: Neither the Upper West Side nor the East Village location of this seafood restaurant has a dessert menu. Instead, complimentary pudding is served at the end of each meal. The Modern: During the holidays, Danny Meyer's French–New American in the MoMA gives homemade Stollen, a traditional German fruitcake, to customers to take home. Sadly, there is no such parting gift when dining at the museum's less expensive and less formal Bar Room. Rodeo Bar: This Southern-themed bar in Gramercy has a free nacho and wing buffet during its daily four-hour happy hour (4–8 PM). Rudy’s Bar: The drinks are cheap at this Hell’s Kitchen dive, which makes the free hot dog you get with every one all the better. Telepan: After a meal at this New American near Lincoln Center, every diner receives a free macaroon. Nothing too big, but a sweet treat nonetheless. The Thirsty Scholar: In addition to great drink deals, this East Village Irish bar offers a free buffet during happy hour. The menu varies, but always includes a pasta dish, a chicken dish and a vegetarian dish, as well as bread (weekdays, 5–8 PM).

Holiday Teatime at the Four Seasons

***CONTENT
The tree at the Four Seasons is 24 feet tall. High Tea at Christmas time is one of those age-old traditions that just doesn't seem to get old. But where to go nowadays, what with the Plaza's Palm Court currently out of commission? Well, the nearby Four Seasons would really love to fill that void for you. Until December 29th, the hotel's lounge and 57 restaurant are offering a \"Holiday Tree Tea\" for families and friends looking to celebrate the season (or at least get a break from shopping). Not that the Four Seasons is much of a mark-down from the Plaza! Tea is served overlooking the hotel's famous 33-ft., I. M. Pei–designed postmodern lobby and the enormous (24 feet!) Christmas tree in the center of it. As part of the package, diners can choose from dishes like candy cane beets with Chevre snow and ruby red confit, and warm sugar baked scones with Devonshire cream and orange marmalade. Or if Christmas-inspired food isn't your thing, there is always the lox and latkes with horseradish and scallion cream (daily from 3–5 PM; $50 per person, $30 for children under 12; reservations recommended, 212-350-6658).

Ask Zagat: Do Champagne Flutes Make a Difference?

***CONTENT
Got a dining question you're too embarrassed to ask your server about? Ask Zagat. With the king of all sparkling-wine-soaked holidays approaching – that'd be New Year's Eve – Zagat Buzz turned to a man who knows his champagne from his prosecco, Hervé Rousseau, to answer our bubbly-related questions. Rousseau, owner of NYC champagne bars Flûte Gramercy and Flûte Midtown, spoke to the Buzz from Paris, where he is opening a third Flûte this New Year's Eve. Zagat Buzz: Are champagne flutes purely decorative? We've heard white wine glasses are better for encouraging the aromas of champagne. Rousseau: Sure, why not, it can help the aroma. But the thing about the flute is that it concentrates the flavor and it also keeps the fizziness in the champagne longer. Because the wider the glass, the more CO2 is going to escape. That is why when people would drink champagne out of cups, before they had flutes, the champagne would go flat very quickly. More quickly than with flutes. And a little tip about flutes. It is better to hold it by the stem. And not because you want to look like a wine connoisseur, the only reason is that this way you won't warm up your glass, basically. Champagne, like any good wine, hates an abrupt change in temperature. Do you have a dining question you'd like answered? Drop us a line at buzz@zagat.com!

Zagat: Helping Striking Writers Find the Right Studio to Picket Since 2007

Zagat Guides will help you find places where you can go to Eat, Drink, Stay and Play, but what about to Picket? Today, another spoof in the grand Zagat tradition has appeared online over at Nikki Finke's DeadlineHollywoodDaily (which remains the place to go for strike-related information). The \"Strikers Guide to Los Angeles Studios,\" written by Jonahtan Schmock, offers picketing writers an entertaining take on the daily scenes at the various backlots, from Fox Studios (Rupert Murdoch serves up \"no easy sneak out routes\" and keeps \"residual-philes\" \"hanging in till three\") to NBC Burbank (\"Enthusiastic die-hards\" stand in \"long lines\" to \"stand in a long line\"). The new Striker's Guide joins a long and illustrious line of Zagat spoofs. This year alone has seen a \"Zagat Guide to Life\" in TIME Magazine and a \"Zagat Guide to the New Congress 2007\" in February's GQ (not online). And that's just the tip of the iceberg. Since the Guide first appeared, its iconic style has been parodied all over, from the Daily Show to the novel Absurdistan (one of the 10 Best Books of 2006 according to The New York Times). And some of them are actually pretty good. One of the Buzz's personal favorites was Noah Baumbach's \"Zagat History of My Last Relationship,\" which appeared in The New Yorker in September 2002.

Wanted: NYC Pit Masters

BBQ in NYC: Hot or Not? What's your opinion on the quality of BBQ in NYC? We recently heard from BBQ maven (and tech whiz) Nathan Myhrvold on the subject – see what he has to say on the Zagat Discussion Boards and join in to tell us what you think! With its secretly guarded recipes and heated tournament circuit, we knew BBQ was a competitive culinary field – but who knew it would become such a dog-eat-dog sport here in NYC? The New York Times reported earlier this week that big-time restaurateur Steve Hanson – who's opening a blockbuster-sized BBQ joint called Wildwood on Park Avenue South next year – has poached Hill Country deputy pit master Lou Elrose for a salary \"approaching six figures.\" Not bad for a retired cop who once sold pulled pork from a food cart out in Ozone Park, Queens. Apparently it all boils down to simple supply and demand economics: more and more BBQ joints are setting up shop here (in the Times piece, Tim Zagat \"estimates that there are about 20 notable barbecue restaurants in New York, up from just a few five years ago\"), all competing for a limited pool of local talent. Meanwhile, Hanson's Wildwood hopes to stand out from the pack with a 100-ft.-long bar, a \"BBQ friendly wine list\" and decor that brings an \"urban perspective to the classic barbecue joint\" – in other words, don't expect your run-of-the-mill roadhouse (225 Park Ave. S.). Additional Wildwoods are expected to roll out by the end of next year, including an outpost in Las Vegas.

The Second Coming of the 2nd Ave Deli

Fans of kosher food, start your clocks. The second coming of the 2nd Avenue Deli, hailed as one of the finest kosher delicatessens in the world – until it closed almost two years ago – has been set for December 17th, a few weeks earlier than initially announced. No longer located in its historic home on Second Avenue (that space is now another Chase bank branch), the new 2nd Ave Deli is located at East 33rd Street between Third and Lexington Avenues in Murray Hill. Besides the new location, the new Deli shouldn't feel that much different from the old one. Expect lots of tiles and the old typography generously strewn around the place (Eater got the first interior shots, if you're curious). Of course, the menu has been expanded a bit, with more smoked fish and other appetizers (think Russ & Daughters) along with the famous pastrami sandwiches and matzo balls, and the whole place is now under new management. Sort of. Former real estate lawyer Jack Lebewohl, who ran the deli after his brother Abe was fatally shot in a terrible and still unsolved 1996 robbery, has handed the reins over to his 25-year-old son Jeremy (162 E. 33rd St.; 212-689-9000).

Of the recently shuttered restaurants and nightspots around town, here are some notable shutterings that Zagat has confirmed: Three branches have recently bitten the dust. Ciao East, the East Village sibling to cheap Italian standard Ciao, has become another Italian by the name of Giano. The Park Slope branch of Tempo Presto has closed, as has 46th Street Japanese fast-fooder Yoshinova. Back in the East Village, longstanding Chinese/Japanese combo Bamboo House on the corner of 6th Street and Second Avenue has served its last meal. Across town on West 3rd, the West Village said goodbye to stuffed pocket emporium Roll and Dough, while The House of Pita on West 48th Street met a similar fate. Finally, Harlem's Seventh Avenue seafooder Pier 2110 has recently given up the ghost.

LA to NYC: Keep Your Cupcakes!

Crumbs in Beverly Hills What we desperately need here in LA is New York pizza, a fine taste of which recently appeared at Joe's Pizza in Santa Monica, reminding those of us who know the difference that New York pizza really is in a class of its own. But instead of pizza, New York seems determined to send us cupcakes, cupcakes and more cupcakes. We're drowning in a sea of Magnolia Bakery clones (Sprinkles, Susiecakes, etc.). And we're also being inundated with branches of New York cupcakeries – Babycakes is set to open on Beverly Boulevard in a few months, and Crumbs just opened in Beverly Hills. Yes, the Reese's Peanut Butter cupcake is awfully good, even sinfully so. But please – we don't have the streets of New York on which to walk off our cupcakes. Our exercise consists of walking from the bakery to our cars parked next door. Feed us cupcakes and we'll look like floats in the Macy's Thanksgiving Parade (another import that we could use, though it probably doesn't travel all that well from coast to coast). – Merrill Shindler

New Year's Eve, the party night of the year, can often be a hassle, what with Midtown becoming a mess and every bar in town filling up well before the ball drops – which is why we are grateful that so many restaurants are opening their doors for the night with festive prix fixe meals and copious amounts of champagne. Such celebrations don't come cheap, but they certainly save you from battling the crowds on your own. Here are some options for dining this December 31st: To start, the highly anticipated newcomer from Daniel Boulud, Bar Boulud, is opening just in time for the New Year. The restaurant's first night will feature two seatings for you to choose from (but choose quickly!). The first, at 5:30 PM, showcases three courses of bistro fare for $80, while the second, starting at 9 PM, offers four courses for $150, including a midnight champagne toast. This one will go fast though, so you better RSVP ... now. Tip of the hat to Grub Street for breaking the news that Bar Boulud would debut on December 31st (1900 Broadway; 212-595-0303). Downtown, Flatiron steakhouse Angelo and Maxie's is going family-style with its New Year's menu, which includes a spread for the table consisting of three appetizers, an entree and two sides, plus a family-style dessert menu ($95 per person; 212-220-9200). On the Upper East Side, seafooder Atlantic Grill is offering a three-course prix fixe that includes an oyster tasting, bay scallops in a short rib risotto and Maine lobster two ways, as well as a dessert of champagne and strawberries. There will be a live band, to boot (seatings between 6:30–7:30 PM and 9:30–10:30 PM; $95 per person, drinks not included; 212-988-9200). For those willing to brave Times Square for the holiday, seafooder Blue Fin is offering a holiday three-courser featuring a Maine lobster bisque with bay scallops and king crab, a pan-roasted 2 lb. Maine lobster and a \"chocolate decadence\" mousse with raspberry coulis (seatings between 5–6:30 PM and 9–10:30 PM; $140 per person, drinks not included; 212-918-1400). Downtown, Union Square's classic Blue Water Grill is offering a three-course prix fixe to roll in the New Year complete with both a jazz band and a DJ. The menu ranges from a king crab thermidor and a Kobe beef negimaki roll with grilled asparagus to a truffle-crusted black bass with tri-color cauliflower \"risotto\" and a slow-roasted Long Island duck breast with kabocha squash gnocchi and crispy sweetbreads (seatings between 6:30–7:30 PM and 9:30–10:30 PM; $125 per person, drinks not included; 212-675-9500). If French is more your thing, Upper East Side bistro Chat Noir is offering its New Year's Eve diners a three-course prix fixe that includes dinner with coffee, some party favors, music and, apparently, \"dancing until dawn\" ($120.08 per person; 212-794-2428). Or there is always Le Cirque, which is offering a four-course prix fixe beginning at 9 PM that includes foie gras ravioli, Chilean sea bass with caviar and champagne sauce and a Grand Marnier soufflé. Not to mention lots of champagne and a live jazz trio. ($395 per person; 212-644-0202) Even pricier than Le Cirque, Craftsteak takes the cake for the most expensive event we've come across this year. Tom Colicchio’s steakhouse is offering an over-the-top night that starts with canapés and a raw bar and leads into a seven-course menu with \"free-flowing champagne,\" there will also be a live jazz band ($495 per person, 212-400-6699). Chelsea's Italian favorite Del Posto is going with a two-tiered system for the holiday. Those who make a reservation between 5 PM and 7:30 PM will be able to order a five-course prix fixe, while those who come after will order from a seven-course prix fixe. On the menu are such tasty treats as a poached lobster salad, handmade beef, pork, veal and hen tortellini with white truffles, Mario Batali's pork sausages sliced tableside and a blended beverage of lemon gelato, vodka and prosecco ($125 per person for five course, $250 for seven courses; 212-497-8090). If you've been looking for a reason to check out SoHo's hot, recently relaunched Italian Fiamma, maybe the rolling in of 2008 is the excuse you've been looking for. The restaurant is serving a three-course prix fixe for the night, the details of which are still in the works (seatings between 5:30–6:30 PM and 8:30–9 PM; $175 per person, second seating includes complimentary champagne toast; 212-653-0100). Over in the Meatpacking District, 5 Ninth is planning on packing people in for four seatings, all featuring a prix fixe meal. Those who go to the later seatings not only get a champagne toast but are also invited to a New Year's party later on in the night ($100 per person at 6 and 7 PM; $125 per person at 8 and 9 PM; 212-929-9460). A more economical option can be found uptown at Harlem's Hudson River Cafe, which is throwing a four-course New Year's bash complete with smoked salmon, foie gras and lots of bubbly ($75 per person; 212-491-9111). Chef John Schaefer's New American off of Union Square, Irving Mill, is offering two different set meals for the New Year. Depending on how hungry you are, you can get a three-course or a four-course menu pretty much all night (5 PM until the new year; $75 for three courses, $90 for four courses; 212-254-1600). Isabella's on the Upper West Side has a three-course prix fixe for the last day of the year that ranges from a Berkshire pork chop with heirloom potato rosti and caramelized endives to seared Hudson Valley foie gras with blackberry marmalade, all with live musical accompaniment (seatings between 6:30–7:30 PM and 9:30–10:30 PM; $80 per person, drinks not included; 212-724-2100). In Chelsea, New American Klee Brasserie is offering up a five-course prix fixe that includes, among other things, an artichoke chowder, tuna ribbons with pomegranate, watercress and caviar puffs, and a Waygu beef roast ($105 per person; 212-633-8033). Both the Downtown original and the brand-spanking-new Uptown Mermaid Inn are offering an unsurprisingly seafood-heavy smorgasbord to ring in the New Year. Downtown there will be a 6:30 PM five-course prix fixe followed by a 9 PM six-course prix fixe. Uptown there will be a 5:30 PM four-course prix fixe followed by a five-course round at 9 PM. On hand will be dishes ranging from Maine shrimp ceviche and seared diver scallops to braised beef short ribs ($50 for the early seatings, $70 for the later ones; 212-674-5870 Downtown, 212-799-7400 Uptown). If you're looking for a place to watch the Times Square revelers while you dine, look no further than Ruby Foo's Times Square, which is offering diners a three-course prix fixe. On the menu at the pan-Asian goliath will be dishes like Thai lobster soup, Szechuan filet mignon and a tuna sushi and sashimi sampler (seatings between 5–6:30 PM and 9–10:30 PM; $140 per person, drinks not included; 212-489-5600). Downtown newbie Smith's is offering two seatings on the last night of the year. An early one for those who have plans afterwards and a later one for those who want to finish the year off in the railroad car–style restaurant. The early birds get a three-course prix fixe while the night owls get a four-courser ($60 for 6 PM seating, $95 for 8:30 PM seating; 212-260-0100). Instead of the standard prix fixe, P*Ong is doing its small-plates thing by offering a holiday tasting menu, with a vegetarian menu available with advance notice ($88 per person, $133 per person with wine pairings; 212-929-0898). If a steakhouse is what you're looking for to ring in the New Year, Primehouse New York would love to help. The Gramercy Park chop shop is offering a three-course prix fixe that includes oysters Rockefeller, Kobe beef carpaccio and a 50-day aged prime rib-eye. Meanwhile, the dessert menu includes a classic baked Alaska (seatings between 5:30–7 PM and 9–10:30 PM; $145 per person, drinks not included; 212-824-2600).

By Karen Hudes, ZAGAT.com staff editor A Voce's boozed-up baba photo: Karen Hudes There's nothing like having a dessert and a drink to cap off the night, and if you can roll them into one sumptuous treat, all the better. We took a hop around town to discover the best confections with a buzz. Malt Shop Liquor The newest burger joints are adding a grown-up kick to their thick milkshakes. At Stand near Union Square, customers suck down a multicolored array of fountain drinks ranging from shortcake-y strawberry ice cream with vanilla vodka to an elevated reincarnation of the Shamrock Shake – light green with fresh mint and a hit of bourbon. A few blocks west at Laurent Tourondel's BLT Burger, old-fashioned glasses, complete with fat straws and syrup all around the sides, deliver a serious shot of hooch. While the Night Rider – chocolate ice cream, Oreos and Kahlua – makes a tempting combo, it's Grandma's Treat – a caramel-drizzled vanilla shake spiked with Maker's Mark – that really packs a punch. And when you're in the mood for some Fox's U-Bet the way Gram never had (or maybe she did?), head downtown to Schiller's for a liquored-up egg cream. Shakes with a shot at BLT Burger photo: Karen Hudes Sugar in Your Cup Tipping the balance, the East Village's new Back Forty mixes a little dessert with its alcohol in the form of a float made with a pint of malty, slightly sour Irish stout topped by a scoop of vanilla. As sweets go, the ice cream does more for the beer than the beer does for the ice cream, so it's best reserved for brew aficionados in the mood for a twist. Offering even more immediate imbibing, Chocolat Michel Cluizel at ABC Carpet does away with the glass altogether, serving shots of liqueur in petite dark chocolate cups as well as in the pre-filled, ID-required bonbons – a serious challenger to those 85-percent cocoa bars. And at Park Avenue Winter, pecan biscotti can be dipped into a steamy mug of cider with hot buttered rum, nutmeg and cinnamon Wombat's tipsy trifle photo: Karen Hudes Drink Like a Sponge In the European school of alcohol-drenched desserts, A Voce, bolstered by new pasty chef Joshua Gripper, leads the pack with its baba Napoletano, a cream-filled, brioche-like cake brightened by a citrus salad and served with a glass of aged rum to pour over it yourself. Fluffy, aromatic and hands-on, it's a knockout combo. (Watch out for old-school purveyors like Veniero's that only use rum syrup in their baba.) Meanwhile, at Williamsburg's Aussie restaurant Wombat, the kitchen whips up a wallop of a Brit-style trifle, layered with whipped cream, custard, currant jelly and sponge cake soaked in Harvey's Bristol Cream. So why shouldn't a woman – especially one who remembers its retro ads – invite a man out for a sexy nightcap like that?

photo: Ryan Charles Last night, the Time Warner Center's Borders hosted a panel and book-signing for Melanie Dunea's gorgeous coffee table book, My Last Supper: 50 Great Chefs and Their Final Meals. Photography subjects (and top toques) Daniel Boulud, Thomas Keller and Eric Ripert were all there, discussing their ultimate meals. \"I was a little pretentious as a French guy to say I was going to Versailles with Alain Ducasse,\" Boulud said with a chuckle. photo: Ryan Charles Even before Dunea and the chefs were finished signing the books (it was a long line!), the after-party began one-flight up at Thomas Keller's Bouchon Bakery. There was a cheese-and-charcuterie table, free-flowing champagne and passed hors d'oeuvres including foie gras. But there weren't any quesadillas, which Keller put on his final meal menu because they make him \"feel warm,\" he explained during the Q & A. photo: Ryan Charles These cookies were (almost) too pretty to eat. The black-and-white photo-cookie in the forefront is of Ripert breaking bread, and just behind that is a color photo-cookie of Boulud in a tux at Versailles. The book's cover is actually a photo of Ripert from the neck down. \"The original cover was Eric [Ripert] with the bread, but I wasn't sure how the other chefs would feel,\" Dunea said. \"He's still my friend even though I cut off his head.\" photo: Ryan Charles Dunea poses with Boulud, Ripert and Keller. She traveled all over the world to photograph the 50 chefs for her book, as they got to choose the locations. Some went for exotic, while other went for the pedestrian, like Laurent Tourondel (not pictured), who chose a Krispy Kreme for his setting and \"must have eaten 30 to 40 donuts,\" Dunea said. – Liz Borod Wright

(L–R) Dave Martin passes out samples of his Fiery Meathouse Pizza; Hanging Tenderloin Martini photo: Liz Borod Wright Those who braved the flurries last night and made it to the preview party of Crave on 42nd were richly rewarded with generous amounts of tasty comfort food served by none other than the executive chef – and Top Chef Season One alum – Dave Martin. \"I do everything from mopping the floors and painting the walls to braising the lamb,\" said an excited and earnest Martin, who explained that he helped spackle to get the multi-colored modern space ready. \"I have full control – food, everything. If it fails, that's my name. I'll take full responsibility.\" And yes, the names and descriptions on the midpriced menu are Martin's too, some of which he concedes might be \"dorky, but that's OK – I'm a dork.\" He was probably referring to the Hanging Tenderloin Martini. That appetizer (pictured above, right) is actually pieces of beef tenderloin atop Yukon gold mashed potatoes, drizzled with an Asian ginger pan sauce and served in a large martini glass. It was well-received at last night's party. Top Chef fans who venture to the far west reaches of 42nd Street for a taste of Martin's cooking won't be disappointed, as he's remembered his roots. Dave's Black Truffle Mac 'n' Cheese, which he created on the reality TV show during the \"final four\" episode, is on the menu as a starter for $14. – Liz Borod Wright

The fate of the East 13th Street space that formerly housed the club Detour has been a large question mark for over a year now, but the Buzz has finally gotten an answer. Last January, we were told that it would transform into a \"gastrosaloon\" and – twelve months later – we've gotten confirmation. According to the owners, Robert Larcom (Myriad Restaurant Group) and Gregg Nelson (Dylan Prime and Devin Tavern), come January or February the space will be home to an American restaurant called The Redhead. More information for you as it comes (349 E. 13th St.; 212-533-6212).

Of the recently shuttered restaurants and nightspots around town, here are those that Zagat has confirmed: Down in the Flatiron District, the Bangkok Cafe on East 20th Street has closed its doors and is becoming Rohm Thai. Further down in the Meatpacking District, the lights have been turned off at Aer. The West 13th Street space is now set to become Kiss and Fly. Over in the East Village, Starbucks lookalike Gregory's Coffee on East 14th Street has closed. Its sibling on Park Avenue South remains open. Over on Second Avenue, Hip Hop Chow has gone dark and is now Nori (tip of the hat to Eater). And down on the Bowery, nightclub Remote Lounge, which made its name because of the video cameras and television screens set up at every table, is gone after a slow decline. Lastly, Pizzeria de Santo on Ludlow Street in the Lower East Side has served its last slice. The space is now set to become an Italian restaurant called Tre.

A New \"Wintermarket\" Gets a Hand From Batali and More

The Fulton Fish Market is set to be a Wintermarket on December 16. Though it's quickly filling up with residential space, Lower Manhattan lacks a number of crucial amenities. For instance, a good greenmarket. But that situation is changing. On December 16th, the area will get a test run of what could become a major indoor public market in the New Market Building in the old Fulton Fish Market by the South Street Seaport. Running from 11 AM–4 PM and free to the public (there is a $5 suggested donation), the December 16th \"Wintermarket\" is something of a proof of concept. The more people who show up, the more likely the market is to return and grow until it eventually becomes a permanent fixture. Because of this, the Wintermarket will have lots of events and tutorials to go alongside its seasonal produce stands full of highbush cranberries, wild ginger, wild watercress, freshly milled oats, farmstead cheeses, fresh dairy products and the like. Besides, haven't you always wanted to have Babbo's Mario Batali serve you a porchetta sandwich? Other chefs on hand to share recipes and small tastes include Alexandra Guarnaschelli of Butter, Patti Jackson of Centovini, David Shea of Applewood and many more. For more information on the Wintermarket, go to www.newamsterdampublic.org/news.

The lounge at ilili Two splashy newcomers are offering exclusive dining deals to Buzz readers. On Tuesday, December 11th, ilili, the upscale Gramercy Lebanese from chef Philippe Massoud (ex DC’s Neyla), will host a special dinner in its sleek space featuring a dramatically cavernous, wood-lined main dining room. Guests will enjoy a glass of champagne and assorted meze to start, followed by a glass of red or white Lebanese wine and a sampling of kebabs. The meal will finish with dessert, a glass of dessert wine and coffee ($65 per person, excludes tax and tip). Diners can also opt for the à la carte menu, but to take advantage of the special shared menu, it must be ordered by the entire table (minimum two people). To book your table at ilili, call 212-683-2929, ext. 1, and mention \"Zagat.\" Then on Wednesday, December 19th, Dovetail, the anticipated American restaurant opening next week on the Upper West Side (103 W. 77th St.), is hosting a special dinner for Buzz readers.

Her culinary aspirations have taken her from The Culinary Institute of America to apprenticeships under French chefs Georges Blanc and Roger Vergé to stints at Old Chatham Sheepherding Company and Napa's Bistro Don Giovanni. Did we mention that Julia Child was her mentor? Cat’s second book, Cooking From The Hip: Fast, Easy, Phenomenal Meals, emphasizes her “go-with-what-you’ve-got” philosophy. Got questions?

The casual bistro is located on the ground floor of River Place – one of the many new high-rise apartment buildings dotting West 42nd Street – and serves moderately priced comfort fare such as \"The $20 Hanger Steak and Fries\" (650 W. 42nd St.; 212-564-9588).

The doyenne of local and sustainable dining offers 19 culinary lessons and more than 250 recipes illustrating her belief that good ingredients trump fancy technique, and food is “extraordinary [when] it tastes like what it is.” And in case you want to exchange something at your local bookstore, here are a few titles to watch out for in early 2008: John Haney, Fair Shares for All: A Memoir of Family and Food (Random House, 304p., January) Frederick Kaufman, A Short History of the American Stomach (Harcourt, 224p., February) Michael Pollan, In Defense of Food: An Eater's Manifesto (Penguin Press, 256p., January) Sara Roahen, Gumbo Tales: Finding My Place at the New Orleans Table (Norton, 288p., February)

The Shake Shack in warmer times. Photo: Noah Kalina What is that sound you hear? That would be thousands of Flatiron District office workers whooping for joy because the Shake Shack, Danny Meyer's ever popular burger joint in Madison Square Park, has finally made a move to lessen its famously unending line. For the winter months at least. Having already announced plans to stay open year-round, today the restaurant's website detailed plans allowing diners to call in their orders and then pick them up without having to wait on line (tip o' the hat to Eater). Which is good, since waiting on that line in the snow is an easy way to catch a nasty cold. The only downside to the announcement? Pick-up is currently available only until March 1st, 2008. The details on how to place an order after the jump... Direct from the Shack: · We’re taking orders for pick-up only · Call (212) 889-6600 to place an order · We’re accepting phone orders from Monday, December 3rd to Saturday, March 1st · $25 minimum for call-in orders, and a credit card number is required · Phone lines open at 9:30 AM , but orders won’t be ready until we’re open 11:30 AM · Sorry, no delivery · Phone orders head straight to the Pick Up Window to grab your grub and go

Indeed Serena, that sandwich you ate in the pilot is now available to anybody dining at Gilt. Photo: Courtesy of The CW Hey there, Upper Eastsiders. Zagat Buzz here. Remember way back when, in the pilot for the CW's super-trashy/guilty-pleasure Gossip Girl, greasy hotel heir Chuck Bass (Ed Westwick) had his father's restaurant's chef at the Palace serve Serena van der Woodsen (Blake Lively) an over-the-top grilled fontina cheese sandwich with truffle oil? Have you been itching to try it ever since? Well, stop scratching. Gilt, the real restaurant in the real Palace Hotel, has permanently added a version of the dish to its bar menu so that you too can embrace your inner Serena. Right now the white truffle grilled cheese sandwich will set you back a mere $50 (when the season's over, a $25 black truffle sandwich will replace it). And by the by, yes that was Gilt chef Christopher Lee serving the sandwich to Serena in the pilot. Oh, and if that isn't decadent enough for you, Gilt now boasts ownership of the largest white truffle to hit the city this year – a 1.51 pound doozy of a specimen that cost the lofty New American a cool $8,000. xoxoZB

Nightlife's Newest Block

Electric Avenue: Pop Burger is coming to 58th Street. photo: Ryan Charles Forget West 27th Street and the Bowery. Gotham’s latest nightlife boulevard is the unlikely stretch of 58th Street lying between Park and Fifth Avenues. The lynchpin of the burgeoning block is the imminent Pop Burger, a Meatpacking District transplant that aims to bring its Downtown formula – a burger joint fronting for a hip nightclub/lounge – Uptown. It’s hard to miss: three stories tall with an appropriately pop facade that wouldn’t feel out of place in SoHo but instead lies opposite FAO Schwarz and the Apple Store. And it just might jump-start a new late-night scene. Make way for 58th Street, a longtime blip on the nightlife radar screen thanks to the venerable Eurotrash magnet Au Bar, and now looming larger than ever. Au Bar is no more, replaced by The Grand, a more egalitarian lounge catering to a younger, Flatiron-esque demographic. Across the street from The Grand is Tao, an Asian fantasy of a restaurant with the heart of a nightclub that’s been a late-night hit from day one. And just across Fifth is the new Jour et Nuit (fka Fredericks), an underground spot still in soft-opening mode that features a front dining room backed by a semi-private lounge à la Cipriani in SoHo (8 W. 58th St.; 212-752-6200). Will 58th Street catch on? Well, that depends entirely upon fickle nightcrawlers. But the Downtown-moves-Uptown trend is already a foregone conclusion in the restaurant world, with boho stalwarts like Blue Ribbon, Clinton St. Baking Co., Fatty Crab and Mermaid Inn all migrating north. – Curt Gathje

On Tuesday evening, Buzz readers were invited to the opening night of Park Avenue Winter, the latest incarnation of the seasonally changing Upper East Side restaurant. The decor, designed once again by the wunderkinds over at AvroKO, is now all winter white, with bare trees and lighting fixtures that resemble icicles. Continuing the winter wonderland theme is a special \"white menu\" featuring all-white dishes like Nantucket bay scallops with baby gnocchi and a dessert of coconut angel food cake with caramel panna cotta and coconut-curry sorbet. If monochromatic cuisine isn't your thing, you'll also find more colorful New American fare on chef Craig Koketsu's seasonal menu, including family-style dishes for \"gatherings\" of two or more, such as live Maine lobsters ($45 per person), Châteaubriand ($44 per person) and rack of lamb ($37 per person). 100 E. 63rd St.; 212-644-1900 See the Park Avenue Winter Menu

Another nail gets driven into the coffin that is Bottle Service Row: Pre:Post, the late-night sup-and-sober-up spot on West 27th Street, has closed. Instead, clubbers can look forward to Suzie Wong, a Chinoiserie-themed nightclub and lounge opening in December that promises to \"reinvent bottle service 101.\" Watch out.

There are no seats in ChikaLicious Puddin'. photo: Ryan Charles The wait for the puddin' is over. ChikaLicious Puddin', the to-go sibling to popular dessert specialist ChikaLicious, opens tonight. Calling itself \"America's First Made-To-Order Take Away Desserts\" spot, Puddin' will initially feature only three menu items: Brioche Bread Puddin', Steamed Apple Puddin' and Adult Chocolate Puddin' and that is it. No rice, no seats and hopefully a much shorter line than its older sibling. 204 E. 10th St.; 212-475-0929

Ask Zagat: Cork or Plastic?  Letting Wine Breathe

***CONTENT
Does cork type matter? Got a dining question you're too embarrassed to ask your server about? Ask Zagat. This week we received two related wine questions and so once again we turned to Roger Dagorn, Master Sommelier at New York's Chanterelle, to answer them. Zagat Buzz: What is the difference between a plastic cork and a cork cork? Roger Dagorn: They are both stoppers. A real cork does breathe though, and so allows for some interaction between the wine and air – in a good way. Real cork is especially good for those wines that need to be laid down and aged for a bit. But as most wines do not need that, plastic corks will work just as well. ZB: And should wine breathe after it has been opened? RD: It depends on the wine. If the wine is tannic or has been closed for a long time, it will need time to oxygenate after opening. But most wines do not need it. For example, most white wines are ready to be consumed as soon as the cork is pulled. Do you have a dining question you'd like answered? Drop us a line at buzz@zagat.com!

By Jeff Freier, ZAGAT.com staff editor For a truly happy meal, try one of these child-friendly restaurants Kid-Friendly Restaurant Guide Boston Chicago London Los Angeles NYC Philadelphia San Francisco/Bay Area Washington, DC Tired of typical kiddie chain restaurants and their Lord of the Flies–like atmosphere? After a grueling day of swinging on the monkey bars, maybe your kids wouldn't mind a change of pace also – especially if it involves, say, a sandwich spot specializing in peanut butter or the promise of a post-dinner game of candlepin bowling. The following list of out-of-the-ordinary dining options could lure the pickiest of eaters from an avowed diet of chicken fingers and french fries (though you'll find that favorite fallback too). You may never get away from the screaming, crying and tantrum-throwing – and that's just the parents – but you just might escape the humdrum for an afternoon or evening. Boston Jasper White's Summer Shack Bella Luna 405 Centre St., Jamaica Plain; 617-524-6060 Does your little Kingpin or Dudette's first tattoo say \"Born to Bowl\"? – then roll on over to this JP Italian featuring a Little Dipper Menu and, best of all, the Milky Way Lounge & Lanes downstairs with candlepin bowling.

Village Smokehouse 1 Harvard St., Brookline; 617-566-3782 Bring your Billy the Kid and Wrangler Jane to this Texas BBQ house for some smokin' meat off the \"For Young 'uns Under Twelve\" menu – but better save the \"Clint Eastwood\" margaritas for when there's a babysitter. Chicago American Girl Place Cafe 111 E.

Broadway Dining Discount Continues, Unofficially

***CONTENT
The Broadway stagehands' strike continues, despite all-night talks yesterday, resulting in a financial disaster for the restaurants that depend on pre- and post-theater diners for their survival. According to the New York Post, some restaurants are so hard up they are contemplating letting staff go. In an attempt to help restaurateurs, the City and the Times Square Alliance teamed up last week to create a special \"Dining in the District\" deal that slashed 15% off lunch and dinner tabs at more than 25 restaurants. And though the promotion officially ended yesterday, some struggling restaurants will extend it. \"As long as Broadway is on strike, we have the discount,\" explained an employee at 44th Street Italian Etcetera Etcetera. Others continuing to offer the 15% discount include Barbetta, Bombay Palace, Brazil Brazil Grill, Brooklyn Diner–Times Square, Kyotofu, La Rivista Ristorante and Nocello. Since participation is voluntary, diners are advised to call ahead to confirm that the discount is still in effect.

Got a dining question you're too embarrassed to ask your server about? Ask Zagat. Once again we turn to John Fischer, an associate professor in table service at the Culinary Institute of America's Escoffier Restaurant, to answer this week's question. Zagat Buzz: What’s the difference between an executive chef and a chef de cuisine? Fischer: The chef de cuisine is basically the boss of the kitchen. The executive chef is sometimes also the chef de cuisine but often the executive chef isn’t in the kitchen doing the actual work. So celebrity chefs will often be the executive chef while they have a chef de cuisine who is in the restaurant working every day. Do you have a dining question you'd like answered?

Talking Turkey with Andrew F. Smith

***CONTENT
Some interesting Thanksgiving “myths” were busted in The Gallery at Astor Center last night. Andrew F. Smith, editor-in-chief of The Oxford Companion to American Food and Drink and author of The Turkey: An American Story, gave a lecture stuffed full of entertaining morsels as part of a pre-opening event for the Center, which debuts in January. He also debunked lots of Thanksgiving “fakelore” and illuminated the holiday’s religious origins and development: – The “First Thanksgiving” never happened – at least, not in the way you learned about in grade school (they ate venison, not turkey, and it was in Jamestown, not Plymouth). – Ben Franklin didn’t propose the turkey as the national symbol. He submitted an emblem of Moses walking out of Egypt. Only when it was rejected and the eagle chosen 10 years later did he offer up the turkey in disgust. – The campaign to enshrine Thanksgiving as an official national holiday began as a one-woman operation in the 1850s. Sarah Josepha Hale believed that a common day of thanks had the power to prevent the American Civil War. We’ll never know. Abe Lincoln enacted it as a federal holiday in 1863. – Historically, 80% of all U.S. turkey consumption took place in the fall, around Thanksgiving and Christmas. Today, almost 60% of U.S. turkey consumption takes place throughout the rest of the year. Why? Turkey bacon, turkey burgers, turkey sausage. Astor Center (399 Lafayette St.) officially opens in January, with a schedule of lectures, cooking demonstrations, wine classes, seminars and food-and-beverage industry conventions, presented with the Culinary Institute of America, the Center’s programming partner. – Josh Rogers

***CONTENT
Got a dining question you're too embarrassed to ask your server about? Ask Zagat. This week we go to a question submitted by Zagat member hudsong631: \"Here's one that my wife and I always debate over at dinner – she loves to drink \"rose\" wine and I always tell her each time that it's the same as Zinfandel – the kind you can get at your local supermarket for 4.99. She swears there is a vast difference – I disagree. So, what's the difference between rose and Zinfandel?\" Before we could get an expert to answer, Zagat member RebeccaD343557 pointed out the main difference between the two: \"Whereas you are probably thinking of the nasty sweet White Zin from the 80's, a good rose can be made from any red grape varietal, or combination of grapes (incl white).\" In other words, not all Rosés are made from Zinfandel grapes. For further elucidation on the topic, we turned to Roger Dagorn, Master Sommelier at New York's Chanterelle restaurant: Zagat Buzz: What is the difference between White Zinfandel and Rosé? Dagorn: Zinfandel is a red grape variety – in its original form it is a full-bodied, hearty red wine. [Rosé is a type of wine.] You see, red wines get the color from the skin; the juice itself is clear. If it is macerated with the skin it takes on that color. That’s why all red wine starts off as clear juice. With times changing in California in the '60s and '70s, red Zinfandel was no longer popular and so Sutter Home – which had planted lots of Zinfandel – had the bright idea that they were going to harvest their Zinfandel, crush it and remove the skins before it tainted the clear juice. By fermenting that clear juice they made White Zinfandel, and with a little bit of tinting it could become a Rosé. They called it blush. It was all marketing but it took off and became quite popular as White Zinfandel or blush wine. Those are not as popular as they used to be though, and mostly Zinfandel is back to its original state as being a red wine. Do you have a dining question you'd like answered? Drop us a line at buzz@zagat.com!

Heffernan's South Gate Gets Ready To Swing Open

***CONTENT
Chef Kerry Heffernan made a name for himself on the New York restaurant scene when he opened Eleven Madison Park with Danny Meyer in 1998. He's since parted ways with Meyer, but is now back in the spotlight with a new venture, South Gate, debuting in the former Café Botanica space in the Jumeirah Essex House on Central Park South. Zagat Buzz caught up with Heffernan in the midst of opening his new restaurant and persuaded him to answer a few questions. Zagat Buzz: Any word on when you’ll open South Gate? Kerry Heffernan: Late December. ZB: What kind of food are you going to be serving? KH: Very modern interpretations of what people have enjoyed so much over the years, Contemporary American with strong roots in Europe. Food that is highly seasonal and that has, at least in some sense, a reference to things that are cooked in traditional and soulful ways. ZB: Since you are going to be located in a hotel, you’ll be serving breakfast and lunch too? KH: Yes, dinner, private dining and we’ll have a bar menu as well. ZB: And what kind of an aesthetic are you shooting for at South Gate? KH: [Designer] Tony Chi has developed a crisp and modern ambiance that will at once be stylish and comfortable. All we can add are the nicest and most welcoming staff, an extraordinary wine list and, oh yeah, great food. ZB: What is your favorite feature of your new restaurant? KH: The enormous new perspective on the Park. ZB: Which do you prefer, Madison Square Park or Central Park? KH: Well, having to choose is kind of like this: I have two sons and love them both equally, but in different ways. ZB: And finally, what is your favorite place to eat in the city? KH: Well, that would be home after successful fishing and greenmarket trips. But if you mean a restaurant, it might be KunJip or Daniel.

Fiamma's dining room will serve lunch in December and January. Have you been looking for a chance to check out Fiamma since it reopened with new chef Fabio Trabocchi? How does lunch sound? In what seems to be an early Christmas gift to Downtown, Fiamma is opening its SoHo doors to the lunchtime crowd from December 3rd through January 31st, 2008. The $35 three-course prix fixe menu will change daily, but expect sophisticated Italian dishes like veal cheeks with \"fine\" mashed potatoes, ossobuco jus and Alba hazelnuts, and mascarpone sorbet with crumbled crostata and espresso (Monday through Friday, noon to 2:30 PM; $35 per person; 212-653-0100).

Closings as sport? Should blogs make a game of restaraunt closings? Tell us what you think on the Zagat Discussion boards! We normally try to stay out of food blog fights, but sometimes we just can't help ourselves. And so today we find ourselves mulling the schadenfreude of watching a restaurant fail. Should food blogs, always happy to see a new restaurant open, be just as excited about seeing an old one die? Is it plain mean-spirited – or just a dose of the cold hard truth – to predict the end of a business somebody has worked hard to create as Eater does in its regular \"DeathWatch\" feature? Coming out firmly against such predictions today was Andrea Strong, of the Strongbuzz: Maybe next week I’ll rant about other things I can’t stand, like, well, Eater’s Deathwatch for one. Ben, I love your site and the frantic incessant news cycle you produce (what is it, every four minutes now?). It’s wonderful, often hilarious, stuff. But come on, Ben. Deathwatch is just cruel and you’re killing (or trying to kill) people’s businesses before they even have a chance to survive. The restaurant business may be just fodder to you, but it’s someone’s livelihood. The Strong Buzz says: Cut it out. What do you think? Are you entertained or dismayed by Eater's DeathWatch feature?

But beloved newly reborn Indian eatery dévi isn't celebrating ... yet. Instead, the Flatiron Indian is holding its celebration back a week so that chefs Suvir Saran and Hemant Mathur, and pastry chef Surbhi Sahni, can premiere their special Diwali menu at the James Beard House and at dévi simultaneously next Friday. After that, the five-course meal – which includes spinach chaat, goat cheese and garam masala pesto-stuffed chicken and Bombay-style \"Koliwada\" halibut – will be available through November 25th, excluding Thanksgiving, when dévi will be closed (November 16–25; $125 per person, includes wine; RSVP at 212-691-1300).

Padma Lakshmi at Borders photo: Liz Borod Wright Last night, Top Chef judge Padma Lakshmi gave a reading from her new cookbook, Tangy Tart Hot and Sweet: A World of Recipes for Every Day, at Borders in the Time Warner Center. No, she didn't recite the recipes, not that fans of the former supermodel would have minded. Rather she gave a spirited rendition (including accents) of three of the essays in the book – one about a peanut-seller in India, another about stealing her neighbor's roses as a teenager and the last about her love of bacon. Then she took questions from the audience, which was a very co-ed group for a cookbook event. One man, who perhaps was dreaming about having her over for dinner, asked if there was anything that Padma didn't eat. \"Yes, but that all went out the window with Top Chef,\" she replied. \"I have lost all culinary inhibitions. I’m not a big fan of tripe. I had to eat bull testicles once in Spain for a documentary I did and I wouldn’t have them again.\" Padma said she had just finished six weeks of filming Top Chef in Chicago, although the finale won't be shot until the spring. She wouldn't spill the beans, but she did reveal this nugget: “There are a lot of strong women in it.” She also talked about the hardships of the show – it's not easy eating all that food at the judges' table. \"I don't eat off the set because I'm having to eat 15 kinds of elk or 12 kinds of pasta,\" she said. \"I would lose my appetite.\" When she's in throes of the show, guess what the two-time cookbook author misses most? \"It makes me want to cook more because I'm not cooking,\" she said, adding, “We do a mental cook-off, a verbal cook-off, at the judges' table.” – Liz Borod Wright

***CONTENT
The BLT Burger Chef Laurent Tourondel is at it again, today announcing yet another expansion of his BLT Restaurant Group. Next spring, the toque will open an outpost of his New York burger joint BLT Burger at the Mirage in Las Vegas. It will be a homecoming of sorts for Tourondel, who was working in Vegas' now closed Palace Court when he was named one of America's Best New Chefs by Food & Wine in 1998. Since leaving Sin City, Tourondel has found success in New York, first with his restaurant Cello, now defunct, and then with his rapidly expanding BLT empire, which since 2004 has grown to include not only BLT Steak but also BLT Prime, BLT Fish, BLT Market and two other BLT Steaks in Washington, DC and San Juan, Puerto Rico. Plans call for the Vegas outpost to follow the aesthetic of the original, with simple American fare paired with small touches like glass-bottled sodas. The space will be designed by the Rockwell Group.

***CONTENT
Got a dining question you're too embarrassed to ask your server about? Ask Zagat. Once again we turn to John Fischer, an associate professor in table service at the Culinary Institute of America's Escoffier Restaurant, to answer this week's question. Zagat Buzz: What's the difference between a sommelier and a wine steward? Fischer: A sommelier [is] the person in the room selling wine to people, helping them choose good wine for the money they want to spend. They should know enough about the wine to recommend it with food and know if the wine is good enough. A wine steward is essentially the same thing – just using English instead of French. But when you get to something like wine director, that’s someone who has managerial responsibilities. Sometimes they will also be called the wine buyer or even beverage manager. Do you have a dining question you'd like answered? Drop us a line at buzz@zagat.com!

While few chefs have achieved rock-star status, plenty more seem worthy of at least Tiger Beat–style adoration. First, the Gourmet Institute announced its first ever \"Chefs of The Gourmet Institute Calendar\" with pin-ups by Melanie \"My Last Supper\" Dunea, and then today the Daily News comes out and asks its readers to vote for New York's Sexiest Chef. On Election Day, no less. Up for the dubious distinction are Benedetto Bartolotta (Osteria Del Circo), Johnny Iuzzini (Jean Georges), Craig Koketsu (Park Avenue Autumn), Sam Mason (Tailor), Todd Mark Miller (STK), Todd Mitgang (Crave Ceviche Bar), Michael Psilakis (Anthos), Aaron Sanchez (Paladar), John Schaefer (Irving Mill), Michael Schulson (the Style Network's Pantry Raid) and Fabio Trabocchi (Fiamma). The actual voting process is simple. If you go to the contest page you are presented with a \"Hot or Not\"–like setup where you can rate the 11 chefs as \"hot,\" \"very hot\" or \"sizzling.\" The good thing out of all this (besides learning more than we'd like to about some chefs' personal lives)? One person who votes will receive a gift certificate for a meal at the \"hottest\" chef's place of business worth $150 (not including drinks and gratuity).

Are Cool Loos Washed Up?

***CONTENT
The garden-variety urinals at the revamped Royalton photo: Ryan Charles In 1988, the brand-new men’s room in the Royalton Hotel – replete with a notorious waterfall-cum-urinal designed by Philippe Starck – arguably introduced the cool loo to NYC's annals of dining and drinking. The once lowly bathroom had arrived, and the Royalton's facility was soon joined by other conversation-starting loos tricked up with self-fogging doors (Bar 89), state-of-the-art commodes (Bette, Ono), one-way mirrors (Dusk, Glass, Peep) and witty photomurals (QT Hotel Bar). Recent developments, however, suggest that the cool loo may be all washed up. Several months ago, the Royalton closed for renovations and it's now back – with its signature men's room waterwall replaced by two garden-variety urinals. Along the same lines, Little Italy's M Bar, once celebrated for its X-rated bathroom wallpaper, has been replaced by a new watering hole with wallpaperless loos. Even Keith McNally, who brought you the droll restrooms at Schiller's (with separate doors for the ladies and gents that open to the same communal room) has resorted to chic but unremarkable stalls at his latest venture, Morandi. Will going to the bathroom become less hip than it once was? Maybe, but there's still hope. One of the coolest loos in recent memory, fashioned out of an aged elevator cab and outfitted with a fold-up railroad car sink, surfaced this summer at the TriBeCa bar Smith & Mills. – Curt Gathje

It's that time again! It's time for Francophiles to get ready to celebrate like... well, like the new crop of Beaujolais Nouveau is about to arrive. All across town, festivities are being planned to coincide with its release on the third Thursday of the month (November 15). And what better way to start the party off than with a free sample of the stuff? For that you can head to Sherry-Lehmann, where Beaujolais importer Franck Duboeuf, of Les Vins Georges Duboeuf, will be on hand to talk about the new vintage, which he says has \"very floral, fruity aromas\" (3:30–5 PM; 505 Park Avenue; 212-838-7500). After you've had a taste, do like the French and celebrate the new harvest at the French Institute's annual Beaujolais Nouveau Fete. Held in the new Le Skyroom, it will feature wine tasting stations, assorted pâtés and breads and a raffle (6:30 PM; tickets are $40 for FIAF members, $55 for non-members; 22 E. 60th St.; purchase tickets at www.ticketmaster.com). Downtown, NoLita's Le Jardin Bistro invites diners to drink as much Beaujolais Nouveau as they'd like for only $12 dollars (with a minimum purchase of an entree). Along with free-flowing wine, there will be a $45 three-course prix fixe menu that includes options like terrine of foie gras, duck breast with pink peppercorn sauce and tarte tatin (212-343-9599). Meanwhile, special three-course prix fixe menus meant to be paired with the new release will be available at Brasserie (5:30–10 PM; $42 per person; 212-751-4840), Brasserie 8½ (5:30–10 PM; $42 per person; 212-829-0812) and Cafe Centro (5:30–10 PM; $38 per person; 212-818-1222). And French strongholds like TriBeCa's Capsouto Frères will be pouring the new bottles all night long.

You gotta hand it to the folks at Blue Smoke and Brooklyn Brewery. You just can't argue with an evening of food and drink entitled: \"Beer and 'Cue: What's Not to Love?\" Indeed. Which is why they're teaming up for a dinner on Monday, November 12th, hosted by brewmaster Garrett Oliver and executive chef Ken Callaghan, both of whom will teach diners how to best pair suds with grub. Held in the Jazz Standard space below the restaurant, the five-course menu will include braised pork belly, Louisiana White Boot Brigade shrimp, smoked chicken and more, all matched with craft beers from Brooklyn Brewery (6:30 PM; $99 per person, includes tax and gratuity; RSVP at 212-447-7733).

Now that there's a chill in the air (and the promise of more cold to come) our minds tend to wander to – what else? – vacations filled with delicious foods. In Italy preferably. But since we're unlikely to be heading to The Boot anytime soon, we'll have to settle for the next best thing: Italian chefs visiting and cooking in New York. For five days next week, five toques from the Maremma region of Tuscany will be gracing the kitchens of Manhattan and cooking up special menus. And to further the illusion of a Mediterranean vacation – and to boost the reputation of Maremma – they'll be toting along local wines and olive oils. From November 5th–9th, the following restaurants will welcome these Italian chefs (reservations are recommended): Del Posto (guest chef Antonio Guida of il Pellicano) Le Cirque (guest chef Andrea Menichetti of da Caino) Maremma (guest chef Umberto Amato of La Fontanina di S. Pietro) Osteria del Circo (guest chef Luciano Zazzeri of La Pineta) San Domenico (guest chef Francesco Bracali of Bracali)

Delmonico's will offer $35 dinner deals as part of Downtown for Dinner 2007. Photo: Noah Kalina While we love a Restaurant Week that covers a whole city or borough, we also love the more focused ones that allow us to explore a single neighborhood. If you feel the same way and live or work Downtown – or just like to eat there – mark November 12th through the 18th on your calendar, because those dates herald Downtown for Dinner 2007. As part of the dining promotion, more than 40 restaurants below Chambers Street have teamed up with the Alliance for Downtown New York (and sponsor BMW) to present an impressive roster of three-course prix fixe dinner deals. There is one catch, however. Some of the participating restaurants (like Ancora Ristorante, Battery Gardens, Delmonico's and Harbour Lights) are offering a $35 prix fixe while others (like Acqua, Fino, Gold St., Les Halles and Trinity Place) are offering their prix fixe meals at $25. For a full list of participating restaurants and prices, check out the Downtown for Dinner website (November 12–18; for more information, call 212-835-2789 or go to www.downtownny.com).

By Liz Borod Wright, ZAGAT.com staff editor Marathon spectators get hungry, too. Here are 26 eateries along the 26.2-mile course. Courtesy of New York Road Runners The 38,000 runners who will compete in the ING New York City Marathon on November 4th get all the glory – not to mention the free water, flavored power gels and pasta dinners to keep them going. But what about the two-million-plus hungry and thirsty spectators who cheer them on all day? They need fueling too. If you'll be playing cheerleader that day, here are 26 possible pit stops for noshing at strategic spots along the 26.2-mile course. Mile 2 Tanoreen 7704 Third Ave. (bet. 77th & 78th Sts.), Brooklyn, 718-748-5600 This Med–Middle Eastern in Bay Ridge opens at 10:30 AM – 20 minutes after the runners take off across the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge from Staten Island. Mile 6 Belleville 350 Fifth Ave. (5th St.), Brooklyn, 718-832-9777 Plenty of New Yorkers consider brunching a sport, so get your game on at this low-key local favorite. Chocolate Room 86 Fifth Ave. (bet. St. Marks Pl. & Warren St.), Brooklyn, 718-783-2900 If it's cold out, warm up with one of this Park Slope cafe's four different kinds of hot chocolate. Mile 7 Press 195 195 Fifth Ave. (bet. Sackett & Union Sts.), Brooklyn, 718-857-1950 The picky eaters in your group will welcome this Park Slope shop's endless panini combinations (as well as tasty salads). Nana 155 Fifth Ave. (bet. Lincoln & St. Johns Pls.), Brooklyn, 718-230-3749 With its versatile menu offering everything from sushi to Thai, this friendly Park Slope Asian fusioner is also a good choice for a group. Mile 8 Thomas Beisl 25 Lafayette Ave. (Ashland Pl.), Brooklyn, 718-222-5800 Duck into this Austrian gem's beer garden for a respite from the throngs of spectators who gather near the Brooklyn Academy of Music. Olea 171 Lafayette Ave. (Adelphi St.), Brooklyn, 718-643-7003 Take a break from cheering by having brunch at this Ft. Greene Med right on the course at Lafayette Avenue. Mile 10 Roebling Tea Room 143 Roebling St. (Metropolitan Ave.), Brooklyn, 718-963-0760 This edgy Billyburg tearoom with graffiti-style artwork offers WiFi, so if your runner friend gave you her racing number, you can visit www.nycmarathon.org and see where she is on the course. Mile 11 Fornino 187 Bedford Ave. (N. 7th St.), Brooklyn, 718-384-6004 Don't even think of trying to cross the race at Bedford Avenue – there's no point when you can eat at this innovative Williamsburg pizzeria on the block's east side. Bonita 338 Bedford Ave. (bet. S. 2nd & 3rd Sts.), Brooklyn, 718-384-9500 Staking out the west side of Bedford? Then check out this budget-friendly Williamsburg Mexican with cool retro decor. Mile 13 Manducatis 13-27 Jackson Ave. (47th Ave.), Queens, 718-729-4602 Carbo-load like a runner on pastas at this old-world LIC eatery. Water's Edge East River & 44th Dr. (Vernon Blvd.), Queens, 718-482-0033 It doesn't open until 5:30 PM, but this seafooder's breathtaking views of the Manhattan skyline are worth the wait. Mile 16 Bistro 61 1113 First Ave. (61st St.), Manhattan, 212-223-6220 After experiencing the only-in-New-York moment of witnessing hordes of runners cross the 59th Street Bridge into Manhattan, take a (very) quick trip to Paris at this old-school French bistro. Café Evergreen 1288 First Ave. (bet. 69th & 70th Sts.), Manhattan, 212-744-3266 Following a quick lunch of authentic dim sum, you can get right back out there and cheer on the runners, who still have 10 miles to go. Mile 17 Iron Sushi 355 E. 78th St. (bet. 1st & 2nd Aves.), Manhattan, 212-772-7680 First Avenue is one of the most popular places to watch the race, so head off the thoroughfare to this less-trafficked side street for inexpensive yet high-quality sushi. Chennai 1663 First Ave. (bet. 86th & 87th Sts.), Manhattan, 212-831-1114 The affordable menu at this new vegetarian Indian won't have you running to the ATM. Ithaka 308 E. 86th St. (bet. 1st & 2nd Aves.), Manhattan, 212-628-9100 In an ode to the country where the first marathon was run, enjoy some classic Greek eats in this charming oasis off First Avenue. Mile 18 Buddha BBeeQ 1750 Second Ave. (bet. 91st & 92nd Sts.), Manhattan, 212-348-7041 In a hurry? The Upper Eastside's only Korean eatery won't take long. Don Pedro's 1865 Second Ave. (96th St.), Manhattan, 212-996-3274 Get your Latin groove on at this Caribbean–South American restaurant. Mile 20 Bruckner Bar and Grill 1 Bruckner Blvd. (3rd Ave.), Bronx, 718-665-2001 It may be a few blocks away from the action, but this New American is a popular hangout for SoBro hipsters. Mile 21 Miss Maude's 547 Lenox Ave. (bet. 137th & 138th Sts.), Manhattan, 212-690-3100 Stop in here for some of the tastiest soul food in Harlem, located one block west of the marathon route. Mile 22 Ginger 1400 Fifth Ave. (116th St.), Manhattan, 212-423-1111 If watching the runners inspires you to eat more healthily, try this East Harlem Chinese where nothing is fried. Mile 23 Pintaile's Pizza 26 E. 91st St. (bet. 5th & Madison Aves.), Manhattan, 212-722-1967 After you watch the runners disappear into the East 90th Street entrance of Central Park, grab a slice to go at this tiny whole-wheat-crust pizza place just off Fifth Avenue. Mile 25 Sarabeth's 40 Central Park S. (bet. 5th & 6th Aves.), Manhattan, 212-826-5959 Visit the newest location of this classic, midpriced Central Park South bruncher, right on the tail end of the race route. Mile 26 Bouchon Bakery 10 Columbus Circle, 3rd fl. (60th St. at B'way), Manhattan, 212-823-9366 Look out on the runners re-entering the park as they head toward the finish line at Tavern on the Green while you savor sumptuous pastries, soups and salads à la Thomas Keller; plus, you can use the bathrooms at the Time Warner Center. Lobby Lounge Mandarin Oriental, 80 Columbus Circle, Manhattan, 212-805-8800 Although the marathoners may look like ants from its lofty perch, the Mandarin Oriental's 35th-floor lounge serves up breathtaking views of Central Park, as well as light fare beginning at 11 AM and tea service at 2:30 PM.

Ask Zagat: Amuse-Bouche or Appetizer?

***CONTENT
We at the Buzz are often asked questions about dining that people may be too embarrassed to ask their servers. Hence our new \"Ask Zagat\" feature, in which we uncover the answers to all your restaurant-related queries. We turned to John Fischer, an associate professor in table service at the Culinary Institute of America's Escoffier Restaurant, to answer our inaugural question. Zagat Buzz: So, what exactly is the difference between an amuse-bouche and an appetizer? Fischer: An amuse-bouche is usually a little bit of food. It literally means \"to amuse your mouth.\" It is supposed to be one bite of food that comes out unexpected and unbidden. It’s a way for chefs to welcome guests by giving them something that is free – though it is actually paid for by the rest of the stuff they buy – but it is also intended to show off the house style a little bit. An appetizer is a first course that would be ordered from a menu. Do you have a dining question you'd like answered? Drop us a line at buzz@zagat.com!

Tenzan, the popular bi-borough sushi restaurant in Brooklyn and Manhattan, is expanding. Very quickly. Seven years after it opened its first outpost in Bensonhurst, and three years after its second branch debuted on the Upper West Side, the restaurant is finishing up two more locations, both on Second Avenue. One of the new branches, on the Upper East Side at 1714 Second Avenue and 89th Street, is already open, and the fourth, at 988 Second Avenue between 52nd and 53rd streets, is set to debut in December.

Of the recently shuttered restaurants around town, here are those that Zagat has confirmed: Apparently there is trouble in the land of the Original SoupMan. Three of the chain's branches, one at 414 Lenox Avenue in Harlem and two at 1369 and 708 Third Avenue, have recently shuttered. However, the chain still boasts six locations in the city and more elsewhere. The Upper West Side recently said goodbye to the All State Cafe on W. 72nd Street and the Columbus Bakery on Columbus Avenue. In the Flatiron District, Eugene on W. 24th Street and Flatiron Joes on W. 21st Street have shut their doors while further west on 23rd Street, Burgers & Cupcakes is no more. Tintol on West 46th Street has closed its doors and is now known as Clubhouse Cafe. And in the Lower East Side, Zozo's Juice & Grill on Orchard Street has shuttered. Finally, in nightlife, the Hook on Commerce Street in Red Hook has closed while Core One Nine One on Orchard Street is now Sixth Ward.

Of the recently shuttered restaurants around town, here are those that Zagat has confirmed: Uptown, Jacques-Imo's NYC on Columbus Avenue recently shut its doors. Across town on Second Avenue, Panorama Cafe also said goodbye. Downtown also lost two spots this week: Mo Pitkin's House of Satisfaction, which closed its doors on Avenue A after two years of partying, and Novo on Hudson Street. Further afield, Gravy on Smith Street in Boerum Hill has been replaced by an angler-themed bar, Big Trout.

The sweets are coming! Some of the folks scheduled to appear at Sweet include (back row, l-r): Florian Bellanger, Alan Rosen, Morris Harrar, Sam Mason, Will Goldfarb, Deborah Racicot, Michael Laiskonis, and Terrance Brennan. Seated: Michael Gabriel and Katie Lee Joel. photo: Food Network Halloween is around the corner and with it bags upon bags of sugar-filled candy. But that stuff is for the kids. Grown-ups aren't really allowed to trick-or-treat. And so you cry: \"What about the grown-ups?\" Enter the first ever New York City Chocolate Week, held from November 4th–11th in honor of the 10th annual Chocolate Show in New York. To celebrate, restaurants around town including Artisanal, Bouchon Bakery, Butter, Brasserie 8 1/2, davidburke & donatella, Le Cirque and p*ong will be featuring chocolate tastings, chocolate cocktails and other chocolate treats both sweet and savory. All of this chocomania culminates with the actual show, which will feature samples, demos, book signings and more (November 9–11; 125 W. 18th St.; each $28 ticket includes admission for one adult and two children under 12; each additional child is $8; tickets available at www.ticketmaster.com or 212-307-7171). If that isn't enough sugar to put you in a coma, then head to the Chelsea waterfront on November 16th for an evening put together by the Food Network imaginatively titled Sweet. The candy lover's dream (and diabetic's nightmare!) will feature pastry chefs, chocolatiers, confectioners, bakers and fromagers from all over town – including Le Bernardin's Michael Laiskonis, Jean Georges' Johnny Iuzzini and Craft's Karen DeMasco, as well as Food Network personalities like Rachael Ray, Giada De Laurentiis and Cat Cora. Of course, sweets aren't the only things at Sweet – there will be wine, champagne and spirits too. Feeling guilty already? Don't. The event will not only be good for your dentist, it will also be good for the children. As a charitable event, proceeds will benefit Share Our Strength and the Food Bank of New York City (9 PM; $200 per person; 269 11th Ave.; tickets available online).

Pecan brown sugar and bacon ice cream These days, pork is popping up in everything from candy bars to margaritas, so it was only a matter of time before someone got the big idea of hosting a bacon-themed brunch. Of course, we're not talking about eggs Benedict here, but rather porktastic dishes like pecan waffles with caramel-bacon sauce, seared scallops on leeks with reduced balsamic vinegar and crumbled bacon and pecan brown sugar and bacon ice cream. Attendees of a special brunch at 2 West on Saturday, November 3rd, will be able to sample those dishes and more, plus listen to Seduced by Bacon authors Joanna Pruess and Bob Lape discuss bacon basics and receive signed copies of their book (noon; $85 per person, includes three-course brunch, choice of mimosa or Bloody Mary and a signed book; 917-790-2525).

The new Bon Appétit supper club, live and in person. photo: Garth Johnston As we mentioned earlier, Bon Appétit launched its \"pop up\" supper club today in the old Hard Rock Cafe space on 57th Street. It being right around the corner from Zagat HQ, how could we not stop by to see if it lived up to its trippy renderings? And it kind of did. By the time we got there the masses had already swept in and eaten up all of Govind Armstrong's grilled cheese with pulled short ribs (Friday's special will be Cat Cora's potato–celery root soup), but there was a steady stream of lesser pedigreed sandwiches coming out of the kitchen. According to the checkout woman, the cafe had been bustling all morning – the four people outside ushering in unsuspecting people off the rainy street no doubt helped. The space is divided into a neon-green cafe/shopping area with a very Au Bon Pain feel to it and a shiny, dark blue eating area with high chairs and tall white tables. Thanks to the streamers hanging from the ceiling, the room feels sort of like a nightclub in an aquarium. Further emphasizing the \"club\" feel of the space, one corner features a DJ booth and nine white bean bags surrounded by faux-graffiti. October 25–November 2, 11 AM–3 PM; 221 W. 57th St.; www.basupperclubandcafe.com

A rendering of the new \"pop-up\" eatery. photo: Bon Appétit Well, you have to give them credit for creativity. Starting today and running until November 2nd, Bon Appétit is operating a \"pop-up\" supper club and cafe in the old Hard Rock Cafe space on 57th Street. What exactly does that mean? Basically if you work in Upper Midtown, you've got a chance to sample foods from \"hot\" chefs for a reasonable price. Toques scheduled to appear in the Rockwell Group–designed space include Emeril Lagasse, Will Goldfarb, Iron Chef Cat Cora, Michael Mina, Govind Armstrong, Michel Richard and more. While the space will be used for \"celebrity-oriented private dinners\" at night, it will be open to the public during the day when dishes will be available for prices ranging from $1.50 to $10. Also planned for the daylight hours are book signings, cooking demonstrations and tastings (October 25–November 2, 11 AM–3 PM; 221 W. 57 St.; for more details, visit www.basupperclubandcafe.com).

C-CAP alum Johnny Cardenas prepares pastrami venison canapés. photo: Liz Borod Wright It's always nice to eat well for a great cause. And if that cause is to further promote great eating, well, better still! Last night, Taj hosted a walk-around tasting event to benefit C-CAP (Careers through Culinary Arts Programs), a non-profit that works with public schools across the country to prepare students for careers in the restaurant and hospitality industries (full disclosure: Zagat is a sponsor). C-CAP alums who have gone on to work for Asiate, Tabla and Eleven Madison Park – to name a few of the well-regarded eateries represented – were there cooking up tastes of fall at their stations. \"I'm now the youngest executive sous-chef that C-CAP has ever had,\" said 22-year-old Kelvin Fernandez, who works at Café des Artistes. He says that C-CAP urged him to enter its cooking competition when he was a student at Long Island City High School. Preparing the best chicken fricassee won him a full scholarship to the Culinary Institute of America. Last night, however, his table was busy cooking diver scallops with black truffle tartare, toasted Hazelnuts and fresh thyme. In its 17 years, the organization has also given away $22.5 million in scholarships. Johnny Cardenas, head of banquets at the Four Seasons Hotel, won a full ride to the French Culinary Institute. Although he was working hard preparing small plates of pastrami venison with cranberry choucroute and roasted celery root, he still had time to praise the program – and his mom. \"I always liked cooking,\" he said. \"My mother was an inspiration to me. She was always cooking and I was always cooking with her.\" – Liz Borod Wright

By Randi Gollin, ZAGAT.com staff editor Restaurant menus aren't just about apps and entrees anymore. Stiff the waiter at your own risk at Vortex Bar & Grill So you made your reservation weeks in advance to avoid that dreaded time slot best devoted to cocktail hour. You show your locavore colors by patronizing restaurants that utilize ingredients from nearby farms. And when tab time rolls around you pay with plastic, cash or your first born, whatever protocol requires. No wonder you consider yourself an upstanding citizen of the dining world. But at a handful of restaurants it’s not enough to follow those conventions. Read beyond the list of lovingly crafted dish descriptions and daily specials and you may discover another set of \"laws\" sandwiched onto the menu, passages that spell out the \"rules\" of the dining game at their establishment in a sassy – or smug, depending on your perspective – manner. At the Vortex Bar & Grill in Atlanta, for example, the menu includes a section entitled …More Stuff You Really Need to Know. It provides a lengthy discourse on everything from the policy of not seating incomplete parties (\"we know all of your little tricks too, so don’t even try them\") to why it’s necessary to tip (\"if you think that tipping is a scam buy yourself a TV dinner, stay home and watch wrestling\") to the touchy topic of separate checks (if you don’t make your request at the start of the meal, \"you’re just screwing up our system\"). At Le Cheval in Oakland, California, the menu is tame enough – though it does include the directive, \"No separate checks.\" And then there's this unusual reminder: \"prices subject to change depending on customer’s attitude.\" Splitting checks is also verboten at the Southhampton Publick House in Southhampton, Long Island – and hey, don’t forget to stop at the ATM first because \"cash gratuities preferred.\" Still, all’s not snarky – this microbrewery also uses the menu to make wisecracks: \"wandering children will be sold at auction, cheap.\" Then there are the quirky kitchen caveats. Ordering a restaurant's signature dish, for example, seems like a no-brainer, but at hot spots like Southern Hospitality, Justin Timberlake’s Dixie-style digs on Manhattan’s Upper East Side, management makes no bones about the fact that supply doesn't always equal demand. The menu offers this consolation to those who find the rib larder bare: \"we only smoke enough meat and poultry for one day – so we sometimes run out of items. But don’t worry, we’ll smoke more tomorrow.\" Should you need an extra push to try the Straus Dairy soft-serve vanilla ice cream specialty at Pizzeria Picco in Larkspur, California, made with extra-virgin olive oil and sea salt, look to the menu for words of encouragement (\"go ahead…you can do this\"). You'll also find this bit of advice: \"we…think you should buy a bottle of wine to take out.\" After putting up with so many rules, regulations and \"helpful\" hints, heaven knows you've earned that vino.

Marcus Samuelsson, the Ethiopian-born, Swedish-raised wunderkind behind Aquavit and Riingo, is readying another restaurant. But this one won't be in New York, it'll be in Chicago. The chef and his Townhouse Restaurant Group partner Håkan Swahn are set to open the as-yet-unnamed eatery (a call to Townhouse couldn't \"confirm or deny\" that the new name will be C-House) in the upcoming Affinia Chicago Hotel in early 2008. The 110-seater will not only serve breakfast, lunch and dinner but will handle food operations for the entire hotel. The food concept is still being settled on. And that isn't all that Townhouse is up to: Two restaurants are planned for Stockholm, and Merkato 55, Samuelsson's Ethiopian entry, is expected to open in the Meatpacking District later this fall. Whew. That not enough Samuelsson for you? The chef keeps a blog too.

Further uptown, the Eighth Avenue branch of Mandler's: The Original Sausage Co. has closed, as has Frederick's on West 58th Street and the Night Cafe on Amsterdam Avenue between 106th and 107th.

Pinkberry Is in the Green

***CONTENT
Pinkberries are popping up all over. The New York Times recently reported on an investment that could seriously change the booming \"fro-yo\" market. Namely that two-year-old yogurt purveyor Pinkberry has scored $27.5 million in its first round of venture capital. Especially noteworthy is that much of that money is coming from Maveron, a venture capital firm founded by Starbucks chairman Howard D. Schultz and former investment banker Dan Levitan. Pinkberry, founded by Shelly Hwang and Young Lee, is by no means the only frozen yogurt company out there, but it has quickly become a name brand in a crowded market that continues to aggressively expand on both coasts. According to The Times, \"the goal, Mr. Levitan said, is to lay the groundwork for expanding the franchise, while being mindful of the all-too-brief lifespan of the last frozen-yogurt trend in the late 1980s.\" So is Pinkberry the new Starbucks? Not yet – it still only has two flavors. But maybe frozen yogurt isn't going to leave the scene as fast as it did last time. Also? An IPO now seems inevitable.

Goodburger is expanding its local empire with a fourth location: a 50-seater at 23 W. 45th Street debuting in mid-November. This follows quickly on the September opening of its Union Square branch at 870 Broadway – the four Manhattan locations have all opened within the last two years.

A New Design Trend?

***CONTENT
Today The New York Times reports that Momofuku Noodle Bar will open next week in its new space at 171 First Avenue (the old space will become Momofuku Ko soon after). The larger venue was designed by Swee Phuah and Hiromi Tsuruta of Design & Construction Resources – whose multiple high-profile projects seem to be giving that other hot design firm, AvroKO, a run for its money. All sleek blond wood, its only adornment will be the original's \"tattered poster of John McEnroe.\" Reports The Times's Oliver Schwaner-Albright: It’s the only piece of decoration in an otherwise sleek room and, according to Mr. Phuah, Mr. Chang said that it was the most important thing in the restaurant after the kitchen, without further explanation. “He said it was the Picasso for this place,” Mr. Tsuruta said. “So we made a niche,” added Mr. Phuah with a laugh. Sure enough, they gave the poster its own alcove, as if it were a religious icon. Hey, at least they didn't decide to put up a pair of deer antlers.

The professional kitchen has an undeniable reputation as a man's world, a reputation which organizations like Women Chefs & Restaurants (founded in 1993 by the likes of Lidia Bastianich, Ann Rosenzweig and Barbara Lazaroff) have worked hard to erase. To that end the organization is throwing a dinner on October 18th featuring 11 female toques and sommeliers with all proceeds going to benefit the WCR's 37 career scholarship programs. Cooking at the dinner will be Anne Burrell (Centro Vinoteca), Rebecca Charles (Pearl Oyster Bar), Nancy Olson (Gramercy Tavern), Amy Scherber (Amy’s Bread), Ivy Stark (Dos Caminos) and more. On the menu are such dishes as Hudson Valley lamb and feta burgers, roasted pumpkin farrotto with gorgonzola dolce, scallop chowder with Pernod and thyme and chocolate bread pudding with cacao nib whipped cream (October 18, 6 PM; Prince George Ballroom, 15 E. 27th St.; $150 per person; tables of ten cost $1,000; tickets are available at www.womenchefs.org or by calling 877-927-7787).

There is little doubt that Julia Child had a huge influence on American eating habits. Her cookbooks and television shows exposed Americans to culinary possibilities that most simply didn't know existed. However, just what her lasting influence on the American palate is in this age of 30 Minute Meals and Top Chef seems to be constantly changing. And so tonight the New York Public Library is holding a discussion on just that matter. Speaking about Julia and her status in America will be Blue Hill chef Dan Barber, authors David Kamp, Molly O'Neil and Laura Shapiro. Melanie Rehak will moderate (October 10, 7PM; New York Public Library South Court Auditorium; $15 general admission, $10 for students, seniors and library donors; for more information call 212-930-9213).

Gordon Ramsay is NYC's top-rated newcomer. Just released today, our 2008 New York City Restaurants Survey – covering 2,069 restaurants with input from a record 34,678 frequent diners – reflected another boom year in NYC dining, with 234 notable openings and surveyors reporting strong spending. Top Newcomer honors went to Gordon Ramsay, the eponymous New French arrival from Britain's bad-boy chef. New-on-the-scene Kefi, Michael Psilakis' affordable UWS Greek nook, took second place. The 2008 Survey's other big winners include Daniel Boulud's New French flagship, Daniel, which has reclaimed the top spot for Food from Le Bernardin, and Sushi Yasuda, the highest-ranking Japanese restaurant in the history of the NYC Survey. Union Square Cafe has once again captured the title of Most Popular restaurant – overtaking its sibling, Gramercy Tavern, for the first time since 2004; Asiate, the Japanese-French aerie overlooking Central Park, is No. 1 for Decor; and Thomas Keller's Per Se took Top Service honors for the third consecutive year.

Preparing the meal will be Eric Rabazzani, the winner of an \"Up & Coming\" chef competition held at the festival last month and judged by a panel of French chefs including Jean-Michel Lorraine, Jaume Tapies and Annie Feolde. At the heart of the competition was a mandate to come up with a \"premium dish highlighting the use of olive oil\" as if the contestants were the executive chef at France's celebrated Le Moulin de Mougins. As the winner, Rabazzani has been put to work for a day in the kitchens of Eric Ripert, Daniel Boulud and Jean-Georges Vongerichten, all leading up to his debut on the 17th. On that night he is expected to produce a five-course dinner focusing on seasonal Mediterranean cuisine. At the end of the evening, a champagne toast will be offered to celebrate Rabazzani, his host restaurant and Alain Llorca, executive chef of Le Moulin de Mougins. If all goes according to plan it should be a grand debut for a new up-and-coming talent (October 17, 7:30–9 PM; $150 per person; 212-924-1200).

Adding That Splichal Touch

***DATE

***CONTENT
By Jacqueline Wasilczyk Joachim Splichal discusses the Smith & Wollensky merger, his restaurant plans for Lincoln Center and more. Joachim Splichal While opening a restaurant is difficult, finding long-term success can be the most elusive part of the process. One man who’s found such rare repeated success is Joachim Splichal, chef and founder of the Patina Restaurant Group (Patina, Sea Grill, etc.). In addition to recently inking a $94.7 million deal to purchase Smith & Wollensky Restaurant Group, Splichal has two high-profile openings in the works: Paper Fish, a seafooder coming to Beverly Hills in November, and an East Coast outpost of Patina opening in NYC’s Lincoln Center in 2009. We recently caught up with Splichal to discuss his growing restaurant empire. Zagat Buzz: Now that the Patina Restaurant Group has acquired the Smith & Wollensky brand are major changes coming up? Joachim Splichal: We will make some changes within six months to a year, but nothing major. There are eight Smith & Wollenskys besides the one in New York, so there is a huge opportunity for expansion in Florida, Atlantic City, all over. ZB: Tell us about Paper Fish, your new seafood restaurant that will be replacing the Beverly Hills staple Maple Drive. JS: Basically 95% of the menu will be seafood. We’ll have a lot of fish flown in from Europe, primarily Italy and Greece, as well as seafood platters. The restaurant will have a huge bar and about 60 seats. The design is very contemporary and very different than Maple Drive. ZB: Should we expect any surprises with the New York version of Patina opening in 2009? JS: Hopefully we can surprise the entire New York population. [Its] cost is far over 30 million dollars and it will hopefully be the most spectacular restaurant ever built in New York City. From a menu standpoint it’s too early to say which direction we’re going to go in, but it will be very, very high end. ZB: What has surprised you the most about the ways in which the cultural environment that chefs work in has changed since you began cooking? JS: Well, it’s a circus in a sense. We are giving the wrong message to people deciding to go into the restaurant business. When you look back 15 to 20 years ago, you became a sous-chef at 28, 29, 30. Now people want to be sous-chefs when they are 22. I think that they are not educated enough. The industry, TV and the media have pushed everybody to become chefs so quickly. Now it’s about how you look when you go on the Food Channel. Are you sellable, are you not sellable, are you cute, how is your smile, etc. Cooking is really not the most important thing anymore. ZB: It seems that an increasing number of young chefs are going to culinary school. Have you come across a difference between those who have been classically trained vs. self-instructed? JS: Some schools offer good training, some don’t. [There are] ones that don’t charge a lot of money and then they don’t give [their students] much. I really have a problem with that. I think you learn it best in the field. I learned it in the field early on and can say that the difference is in you. If you are passionate about [cooking] you’ll learn very quickly and grow very quickly. If you are just so-so, you will stay where you are. It’s all about the passion and the dedication. If you don’t have it, don’t go into the chef business. ZB: How closely is the business side of running a restaurant related to being a chef in the kitchen? Do you think you’ve struck a balance between both duties? JS: I would say I’ve struck a balance because I wouldn’t be where I am if I hadn’t. A lot of chefs are good in the kitchen and have no clue how to run a business. These days restaurants are businesses. When you look at any of the big chefs, Charlie Palmer, Daniel Boulud, Traci des Jardins, Mario Batali, Wolfgang Puck, etc., they are running 30 to 60 million dollar businesses – so you have to be good both [as a chef and a businessman] because otherwise you can’t grow. ZB: Has what drives or inspires you as a chef changed over your career? JS: No, I don’t think so. Unfortunately, I don’t have as much time to do the kitchen stuff because I am busy and [the company is] just growing and growing. I want to make sure our growth goes into the right direction. And so I have focused much more on the development of the company than anything else. That doesn’t mean I ignore it though. I still have a passion for [cooking].

Like many in the media, we here at the Buzz receive an awful lot of press releases, some good, some bad and some just...special. We recently received one that falls firmly into the latter category. We're talking a press release that manages to tie together Times Square, Red Square, pizza, the Harlem Globetrotters and red caviar. We couldn't make it up. See for yourself, after the jump: As you may know, October is National Pizza Month, and to celebrate Sbarro is staging a culinary swap between its two flagship stores in New York City’s Times Square and Moscow’s Red Square on October 17th from 11:00am to 2:00pm. As a nod to the global appreciation of pizza, chefs from each country will be swapping locations and bringing local specialties to a different part of the globe. Russian chefs will be on site to create a limited edition menu for this one day event, including an “Around The World” pizza, comprised of half pepperoni (the #1 topping in America) and half red caviar (a favorite in Russia). The Harlem Globetrotters will be a key part of the international festivities, spinning pizza dough on-site and teaching the guest chefs the art of spinning basketballs. As the Globetrotters are Sbarro’s philanthropic partner for “Times Square to Red Square,” Sbarro will be donating a portion of the day’s sales to the Globetrotters’ national philanthropic program, C.H.E.E.R., to benefit the character development of elementary school children. Below, please find the media advisory for the event, and should you have any questions please do not hesitate to contact me at [redacted] or at [redacted].

The ability to ferret out great deals on good food is a chief characteristic of the urban gourmand. So what kind of help would the Buzz be if we didn't point out a good deal now and then? For instance, if you've been meaning to try the Japanese-French cuisine at Asiate atop the Mandarin Oriental but were worried about your wallet (after all, Zagat surveyors spent an average $84 at the restaurant), there's always its $24.07 lunch deal, which includes any two items from a selection of 10. Want more? Additional courses cost only $12, and include crab with avocado gnocchi, tomato ragu, arugula pesto and guacamole, as well as a smoked salmon risotto with salmon roe, nori seaweed puree and shiso (212-805-8881).

By Liz Borod Wright, ZAGAT.com Staff Editor Zagat Buzz talks to Top Chef winner Hung Huynh to find out how he'll spend his $100,000 prize money. Hung Huynh photo: Virginia Sherwood, Bravo Last night, Hung Huynh won the title of Top Chef on the popular Bravo TV series, blowing the judges away with his sous vide duck dish. Out-cooking 14 cheftestants throughout 14 episodes, he consistently wowed the judges with his top-notch technical skills but combated criticism that he didn’t cook with soul. ZAGAT.com talked to Huynh about his future plans and how he’ll spend his $100,000 prize money. Zagat Buzz: So what are your plans now that you're Top Chef? Hung Huynh: I have of a lot of options so I’m just going to weigh them all and not rush into anything. But, I’m thinking about New York or Las Vegas at this moment. ZB: Are you thinking about collaborating with Rocco DiSpirito? You were joking about that last night. Or were you being serious? HH: I think we’re joking at this point [laughs]. But we’ll see. ZB: Or how about with your friend Marcel Vigneron, who competed in season 2? HH: No, we have very different styles. But you never know in the future. Anything could happen. Anything. ZB: Would your dream now be to open your own restaurant? HH: Open my own restaurant with my own money? Not so soon because I really don’t have that much money to do what I really want. ZB: So $100,000 prize money isn’t enough? HH: That’s probably not even enough for my stove. ZB: So what are you going to do with the money? HH: I’m going to travel with it. I’m going to go to Spain to work at El Bulli or Arzak for free for a while, learn more techniques and more flavor profiles. I’m also going to travel to Asia. I plan to donate some of the money to Buddhist temples in Vietnam. ZB: Rocco said he thought that you just gave him busy work – is that true? Were you trying to hide your secrets from Rocco? HH: No, definitely not. He helped me so much, I guess he didn’t get to see everything put together. I had new components for every dish. He thought I was leaving him out of the big picture but I wasn’t. ZB: Were you surprised how well Dale did and how poorly Casey did in the final challenge? Most people were expecting the opposite to happen. HH: I didn’t think Casey did that bad because I was in the back the whole time, paying attention to myself. And then when we watched the whole show last night, wow, I was really surprised. I expected so much more from Casey. So I was really surprised that she did so poorly. ZB: Throughout the competition, the judges have criticized your food for lacking soul. How do you think you finally showed them your soul? What did you do differently this time? HH: Well, I was able to use my Asian background to cook really good food. Using Asian ingredients is what I love to do with my food, and I got to showcase that. And, I guess that’s where my inspiration came from, and I was able to cook the food that I really wanted to eat myself, food that I wanted to cook, and there really was no limit. I really put my heart and soul into it, whereas in the other challenges we were so limited. ZB: What did your family think about you entering this competition? HH: At first they didn’t know what to think, but now they understand why I sacrificed so much time away from them and why I am the way I am. My mom always knew I was hardcore but now she sees me in action in a professional environment – she understands my work now. ZB: What’s your favorite restaurant? HH: Where? ZB: Anywhere. HH: My favorite restaurants in New York City would definitely be Park Avenue Autumn and Quality Meats. They’re both good restaurants.

But that isn't the strange part. She then went and photographed them and the result – My Last Supper: 50 Great Chefs and Their Final Meals (Bloomsbury), which hits stores November 6th – has to be seen to be believed. Think Tony Bourdain completely naked but for a cigarette and a well-placed hunk of meat, or Masa Takayama smiling as a group of orthodox Jews dance around him, or Gary Danko lounging lavishly Caligula-style, or Lidia Bastianich donning a surreal hat made of pasta (pictured) or, well, you get the idea… Eric Ripert // var fo = new SWFObject(\"/img/buzz/20071004_eric.swf\", \"eric\", \"243\", \"237\", 6, \"#ffffff\"); fo.write(\"flashcontent_buzzImg_eric\"); // Eric Ripert © from My Last Supper by Melanie Dunea/ CPi. published by Bloomsbury Then there are the details of all those glorious last meals. Guy Savoy has a fear of death so strong that he can't even discuss the topic (\"I have a phobic rapport with death, and because of this, will never discuss my last meal! This returns me to my life's philosophy: I talk about openings, not closings.\"). Meanwhile, Masa Takayama has a deep fascination with food taboos (\"it is my final wish to see people with dietary restrictions enjoying food they wouldn't normally be allowed to eat.\"). And while many of the chefs would understandably want to cook their own last meals, just as many would be perfectly happy to resurrect the great chefs of yesteryear like Auguste Escoffier. Finally, there's a section devoted to recipes culled from the final repasts, including an ahi tuna poke from Charlie Trotter, Thomas Keller's favorite roast chicken and a recipe for truffled country bread from Eric Ripert.

Last night, new Lower East Side restaurant Allen & Delancey opened its doors with Neil Ferguson, former chef de cuisine at Gordon Ramsay, at the helm. An elegant New American menu showcases Ferguson's formal European training and glides from appetizers like \"Caramelized Bone Marrow, Domestic Caviar, Shallot Puree, Cornichon Gastrique\" ($18) to entrees like the deceptively simple-sounding \"Cabbage, Beef and Onion\" ($29). It's served in a Downtown setting decorated with found objects and mismatched finishes (exposed brick, painted cement, fabric wallpaper) in homage to the neighborhood's multilayered history. 115 Allen St.; 212-253-5400 Discover More New Restaurants in NYC

Starting next Monday, chef Scott Bryan (ex Veritas) will be in charge of the kitchen at 2941 in Falls Church, VA, for three months while the owners recruit a new head toque. Bryan says that he's looking forward to cooking in 2941's \"great kitchen facility.\" \"I'm used to working in a tiny kitchen and now I can do more adventurous stuff,\" he says. The opening executive chef, Jonathan Krinn, and his chef de cuisine, Jon Mathieson, are leaving to open their own New American dining spot in Tysons Corner, VA. Krinn's father will be baking bread there just like he did at 2941. Bryan, who has trained at some of NYC's top-tier restaurants (Gotham Bar & Grill, Bouley, Le Bernardin and the late Lespinasse) can help DC foodies, who are slavering for Wolfgang Puck’s specialties at The Source (opening next week) and for Eric Ripert's at Westend Bistro (opening in November), get their fix of fine cuisine. – Olga Boikess

By Jacqueline Wasilczyk Zagat Buzz talks to cheftestants Dale, Hung and Casey about tomorrow night's finale. Hung, Casey and Dale Dale Levitski Hung Huynh Casey Thompson From creating an amuse-bouche using leftover hors d'oeuvres, to cooking trout on a wood stump, some unusual culinary challenges have faced this season's remaining Top Chef contestants. With season three coming to a close live on Wednesday, Zagat Buzz took the opportunity to ask the three remaining contenders, Dale Levitski, Casey Thompson and Hung Huynh, to reminisce about their favorite moments from the season and comment on the showdown that lies ahead. Dale Levitski Zagat Buzz: How did your level of training factor into your success? Dale Levitski: It sounds odd but I think one of the reasons I've become a successful chef is because I've never had any formal training. I'm able to truly cook raw from the heart and not be boxed in by all the rules. ZB: In your opinion what was the worst dish created on the show? DL: I think Hung's \"Smurf village\" was absolutely hilarious, but we all made some pretty bad food. ZB: Was there any moment that got edited out in post-production that you wish had been left in? DL: Sure, I think we all have our moments that we would have liked to see shown and some that we are thankful that weren't shown. When I'm under stress, the *%$# that flies out of my mouth is just very inappropriate. ZB: What was your game plan entering the finale? DL: I really thought about why I was cooking, and how I cook. That was my strategy going into the finals. Cooking as myself. ZB: In what way do you think your participation on the show will impact your reputation as a chef? DL: Chicago has been my biggest cheerleader. When my restaurant opens I can guarantee it's going to be packed. The support from the restaurant community – which I did not expect – and general public has been so overwhelmingly positive. ZB: What are your future plans? DL: I'm going to be opening a restaurant with business partners probably [in] late winter/early spring. That's been in the works since before I did the show. I'm going to do an upscale diner – breakfast, lunch and dinner seven days a week – in Downtown Chicago. Back to Top Hung Huynh Zagat Buzz: The judges have accused you of lacking the heart and soul that the other contestants have. Do you feel that this is a result of your classical training? Hung Huynh: Absolutely not. Just because I'm Asian doesn't mean I need to use soy sauce and make won ton soup at every challenge. I like Asian influences in my food, but when would I get the chance to do that? I think everybody in the end will realize who Hung is on Wednesday. ZB: In your opinion what was the worst dish created on the show? HH: Dale's Quickfire [\"frozen pie crust\" challenge] with Maria Frumkin and Micah's avocado soup for the \"Sunny Delight\" challenge. They were dog puke. It was interesting how he could put a dish up like that. It's amazing to me. It was god awful. ZB: How do you feel about Dale and Casey calling your supermarket aisle Quickfire the worst dish? HH: Well, yeah. But I'm sorry, if you give me cereal, coffee and powdered chocolate, and [consider the dish] I came up with? [They] should give me props for that. ZB: Do you think the head judges ever made a bad call during the season? HH: Of course Tre should not have gone home, but I guess if you are the [executive] chef [in the \"Restaurant Wars\" challenge], you go home. I thought Howie should have gone home vs. Clay. Things like that were controversial. But that's just my opinion. So hopefully they pick the right winner. Hopefully it's not based on who's the pretty girl or who's the big gay chef. ZB: How does your on-screen persona differ from your personality in real life? Were you fairly represented? HH: I've been represented pretty well, but I guess I was a little *%$# at times. If you don't understand my humor or my sarcasm you may not like me, but if you do, you'll come back for more. ZB: Dale said he felt happy some moments didn't make it to air … do you feel the same way? HH: Yes. There were things I said that would really offend people I was talking about, some of the guest judges. I understand they have their own opinion of course, but there are moments [when] you want to ask, \"Where did you pull this stuff out from?\" ZB: What plans do you have for the future? HH: Definitely to travel if I do win, learn more great techniques, learn more flavors, spend more time with my family and hopefully go back to New York and have a place. For the next three to four months I plan to stay in Las Vegas and wait for my money if I do win. I don't want to open a restaurant with my own money any time soon. I want to work with other investors and have my name on the door, and get more recognition. And after that, have my empire just like chef Tom Colicchio. It's going to be based on technique and crafts and cooking to perfection. Back to Top Casey Thompson Zagat Buzz: It's been emphasized in recent episodes that while Hung is technically superior, you and Dale have heart and soul. Do you feel that your lack of formal training has allowed you to cook with more soul? Casey Thompson: Yes, I do believe that it's true. Everybody loves to watch Hung make these technically proficient dishes, but one of my friends pointed it out perfectly by saying, \"You know, there's not really anything that I've seen him make that made me feel that I wanted to eat [what he cooked].\" Even his dishes lack color. ZB: In your opinion what was the worst dish created on the show? CT: I am going to have to go with Hung's landscape [for the] the breakfast aisle trial. I've never seen anything like that. It was hilarious. He was crushing up the blue Fruity Pebbles to make water. It still cracks me up. ZB: Who was your favorite guest judge and who was the hardest critic? CT: My favorite, favorite guest judge, hands-down, was Anthony Bourdain. The hardest critic? I'd probably have to say him also. That's why we liked him. People were shaking in their boots when he came in. He's been around, he's traveled the world and you're not going to pull anything over him. ZB: Hung recently said that he doesn't want the finale to be based on sexuality or good looks. Do you have any comments? CT: Well, of course I don't want it to be based on sexuality or looks. I just think that that's ridiculous. And that's something that the people out there have sort of conjured up, which I think is very unfair. I don't want to be thrown in that category because I've definitely cooked my ass off. I want to be judged on my food and the examples that I've set and shown throughout this competition. ZB: Was there any moment that got edited out in post-production that you wish had been left in? CT: There were some times when people would say some really nasty things, and not to be malicious, but I just felt like, you know, if the world only knew that you were really like that, they wouldn't like you at all. ZB: What was your game plan entering the finale? How did you decide what ingredients to bring? CT: Ok, the difference between me and them [is] I work a lot a lot a lot. It's pretty funny how when we got back together everybody's like, \"Oh yeah, I took some time off, went on vacation, got some massages.\" I think Dale went to Hawaii or something. And I'm like, I'm so glad you guys got to take some time off because I certainly didn't. Sunday is my only day off, but I was in the kitchen, trying to work on a couple things, some ideas, some different techniques and practices. ZB: What are your future plans? CT: Dallas is my home. I love it here, I have so many friends and family here and I don't plan on leaving. Now Shinsei [where she’s executive chef], just being a little over a year old, I'm very, very proud of it, and the direction it has gone. I know they hope to open a second and a third. Who knows how many Shinseis there could be? As far as my plans right now, I don't plan on leaving. They joke that they may soon not be able to afford me, but they have been supportive. Any direction I want to go in, they're behind me. Back to Top

Dosa Man Takes Top Vendy

This weekend, the third annual Vendy Awards were held in Tompkins Square Park to much fanfare. All five finalists were there serving up their wares to a hungry crowd and a roving band of judges (including Ed Levine from Serious Eats). The good folks over at Gothamist were there as well and have a good wrap up of the event: Saturday night’s Vendy Awards ended in victory for “Dosa Man” Thiru Kumar, the all-vegan, South Indian crêpe vendor of Washington Square South who had previously taken the runner-up title for the last two years. At the awards ceremony capping off a 5 hour eat-a-thon, Kumar was presented with the silver “Vendy” trophy by last year’s winner Samiul Haque Noor, from Sammy’s Halal. The winner of the \"People's Choice\" award was Mohammed Rahman of Kwik Meal on 46th Street and Sixth Avenue. The Vendy Awards, which are a part of the Urban Justice Street Vendor Project, is an annual event dedicated to honoring some of the less visible workers in NYC's food industry. If you'd like to sample the Dosa Man's vegan foods yourself, you can find him most days on Washington Square South and Sullivan Street.

Waking up From a Kitchen Nightmare

Purnima/Dillons Bar as it appeared right after Ramsay's visit. photo: Liz Borod Wright Last night on his new Fox show Kitchen Nightmares, Gordon Ramsay went to Purnima/Dillions Bar on 54th Street and found things looking...not so good. We're talking bugs in the basement, rotting meat and other unappetizing treats (you can see for yourself here). The episode was notable not only because of the gross situation at Purnima, but because of the legal troubles the makeover caused for the show. Former manager Martin Hyde, who comes across poorly in the episode, tried to sue the show earlier this year, calling it an example of \"fake TV.\" The case was eventually thrown out of court. To find out how the Nightmare might have changed business at the midtown eatery, the Buzz stopped by today during lunch hour and chatted with one of the restaurant's managers, Andrew Blackmore-Dobbyn. Unsurprisingly, we had the place pretty much to ourselves. So was the scary stuff on the show real, or just the magic of the editing room? He couldn't be sure as he hadn't seen the episode yet, though he did tell us he had \"no qualms showing [us the] basement\" (we politely declined the offer). Blackmore-Dobbyn credits chef Vikas Khanna, who Ramsay brought in as part of his rehabilitation, for turning the restaurant around. Part of the problem when Ramsay got there, he says, was that there simply wasn't anyone in charge of the kitchen (despite the presence of three managers). \"Thank god for Vikas! He's had the personal authority to really follow through on making changes. If you had visited before Vikas showed up [and then returned now] you would say 'Oh my God, it's like a totally different thing is happening.'\" And to be fair, the restaurant does appear neat and clean during today's visit. Has the show brought in any new business since it aired last night? Not so far, but it has been less than 24 hours. There were, however, a few prank calls right after the episode aired and a number of interested parties on the phone this morning, including one call \"to talk about hosting a gay bachelor party.\" And has Ramsay, whose eponymous restaurant is right down the street, been back for a post-show visit? \"Oh, no. We haven't seen hide or hair of Gordon since they finished taping.\" – Garth Johnston

As for nightlife venues slipping away, some of the recently departed include Double Happiness and the Palais Royale in Nolita, Remy Lounge in TriBeCa, Luke & Leroy's in the Village and Williamsburg's free-pizza staple Capone's, now being turned into a gay bar by the name of Sugarland.

Opening in mid-November and called ChikaLicious Puddin', the newcomer is billing itself as \"America's First Made-To-Order Take Away Desserts\" spot. Amazingly, Puddin' will initially feature only three items on its menu (Brioche Bread Puddin', Steamed Apple Puddin' and Adult Chocolate Puddin'), all \"made to order, out of the oven and into your hands.\" The new spot won't have seating or serve alcohol, but it will have your standard caffeinated beverages. And in case you were concerned, the folks over at ChikaLicious want to assure you that they have no intention of stepping on any other pudding places' toes, telling us that \"no rice pudding of any sort will ever be considered for menu placement!\"

Bobo Photo: Noah Kalina Soigné new Villager Bobo feels miles away from the Seventh Avenue strip given its townhouse space done up like an old-world apartment complete with moody subterranean bar, antiques and family photos–bedecked upstairs dining room and adjoining alfresco terrace; the name’s short for ‘bourgeois bohemian,’ but bohos should beware the prices on its Provençal-inflected European menu. 181 W. 10th St.; 212-488-2626 See More Details Discover More New Restaurants in NYC

***CONTENT
Tavern on the Green, the second-highest grossing restaurant in the country, has found itself in the middle of a legal snafu with the federal government. According to Crain's, \"The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission slapped Tavern on the Green with a lawsuit Monday alleging racial and sexual discrimination.\" At the heart of the complaint is the allegation that Tavern management took part in “severe and pervasive sexual, racial and national origin harassment,” and that employees who complained about the problem were punished unfairly. In a statement, the restaurant said that it had previously conducted an investigation into the charges and found them to be baseless. A telephone call to Tavern on the Green was not immediately returned.

***CONTENT
Fans of outdoor dining have reason to rejoice. Today the Bloomberg Administration OK'd a new rule allowing restaurants with properly licensed outdoor eating areas to install heat lamps with minimal legal hassles. Sidewalk dining has grown increasingly popular in the past decade. This year there are approximately 900 legally operating sidewalk cafes, according to the City, which represents a 25% increase in just four years. The new rule approved today creates a simple process for licensed restaurants to gain Fire Department and Department of Buildings approval for the addition of gas heaters and their accompanying hardware. The City promises that, assuming paperwork is in order, restaurants will be able to complete the application process in no more than 18 days.

***CONTENT
Many chefs dream of making it big in New York, but there are also a few successful New York chefs who dream of making it big back home. Chef Dante Boccuzzi falls in this latter category. Last spring, Boccuzzi left his executive chef position of five years at NYC's Aureole, a role that had reunited him with his post-CIA mentor Charlie Palmer, to strike out on his own – not in New York, but in Cleveland – with Palmer's blessing to boot. Boccuzzi, an Ohio native, had completed a culinary loop that included stints at L'Escargot in London, Silks at the Mandarin Oriental San Francisco and Armani/Nobu in Milan. \"He's continued to develop as a chef and manager. It makes sense that he wanted his own restaurant. He's earned it, put in his time. I think he's ready for this,\" Palmer told Cleveland Magazine. Boccuzzi will open Dante in the Cleveland suburb of Valley View (8001 Rockside Rd.; 216-524-9404) on Saturday, September 29th, and celebrate with a grand opening gala on Friday, October 5th. He took over Lockkeepers in March, running the fine-dining favorite until September 21st, when he closed the restaurant so that its transformation into Dante could begin. A revamped menu will highlight Boccuzzi's skill at weaving Asian and Italian ingredients and flavors with French technique, and feature homemade charcuterie, starring his Parmatown pork proscuitto. He describes the menu as \"New York style with Cleveland prices.\" The formerly lodge-like dining room will boast sleek, modern elements, and the bar area will invite lingering with couches and a communal table. \"I wouldn't have accomplished what I have without Charlie,\" Boccuzzi told the Buzz. He noted that the best part about going home is that, \"In New York everyone fights for attention. Here, I'm a big fish in a small pond. And I live 10 minutes away, no traffic.\" – Deirdre Donovan

Since a video of rats scampering around a KFC/Taco Bell the day after a health inspection surfaced last February, rats in restaurants has become a hot topic (and not in the Pixar/Disney sense). Now new numbers show that at least New York's Department of Health has taken the scandal to heart. The New York Post has crunched the DOH numbers and found that \"25.2 percent of the 28,955 eateries inspected in the 2007 fiscal year, which ended June 30, failed their initial exams. A year earlier, the failure rate was 19.9 percent.\" Just as significant, 48 percent of those cases involved what inspectors called \"signs of active rats.\" Increased rodent awareness training for inspectors is thought to have contributed to the jump in citations, though the bump in closures hasn't stopped intrepid TV crews from filming the vermin in situ.

Of course, these pushcarts were laden with the likes of Maine crab cake corn dogs and frog \"wings\" tempura with celery kimchee. In addition to recognizing some of Gotham's top culinary talent, the tasting event marked the culmination of the three-day StarChefs.com International Chefs Congress, which featured live cooking demonstrations, hands-on workshops and smaller discussions led by top toques from around the world, including José Andrés, David Bouley, Wylie Dufresne and Joël Robuchon. Torching the eel and foie gras terrine at the L'Atelier de Joël Robuchon pushcart photo: Carla Spartos The most popular pushcart? The calamari and carrots cooked up by Michael Anthony of Gramercy Tavern, which was the first dish to go. But there was plenty more to sample, including the famous eel and foie gras terrine from L'Atelier de Joël Robuchon, which was mistaken by some passersby for crème brûlée. L'Atelier chef Yosuke Suga was one of 15 \"Star Chefs\" awarded at last night's ceremony. Chef Aktar Nawab handing out his pickled tongue dish photo: Carla Spartos Another honoree, Akhtar Nawab of The E.U. served pickled tongue torchon with porcinis and Marcona almonds. Each dish was specially paired with a wine or cocktail by sommelier Stephane Colling of The Modern and mixologist Jim Meehan of PDT and Pegu Club. Daniel Boulud, top chef and Evian enthusiast photo: Carla Spartos Meanwhile across town at Daniel, a party celebrating the launch of Evian's new Palace Bottle was underway. According to the PR material, it \"offers a new level of luxury for consumers to enjoy a premium water experience\" – coming soon to a fancy dining establishment near you (including, of course, Daniel).

With the passing of Luciano Pavarotti, the world lost not just a great voice – but a great eater as well. In the many NYC restaurants that he frequented (including numerous spots in Little Italy), the Maestro was much loved as a legendary trencherman, capable of putting away a meal that would have fed half a dozen. In a recent Salon article, flutist Jean-Pierre Rampal recalls a post-performance downing of clams at Elaine's to the repeated call, \"Vongole al forno!\" At Cafe Fiorello across from Lincoln Center, Pavarotti's table – numbers 61 and 62 – has a plaque memorializing it as the great tenor's haunt. Pavarotti was also known to have desserts from Italian bakery Ferrara delivered to him while in New York. His considerable girth (an estimated 350 pounds) came from decades of eating with abandon and consuming wine by the gallon – white Lambrusco, along with his most beloved reds, Ornellaia, Sassicaia and Tignanello, glasses of which he always offered to colleagues, noting the importance of \"a glass or two to lubricate the spirit.\" But mostly he loved pasta, telling a reporter that \"a good Italian restaurant must above all make good pasta. As for the other dishes, whether roast beef or fish, other restaurants can make them just as well. Pasta is the heart of an Italian restaurant.\" And that, for us, is the image of Pavarotti that lingers – with a huge napkin tucked into his shirt collar, and an overflowing platter of linguine (flavored with tomato, garlic, Italian parsley, olive oil, red pepper flakes, black pepper and Reggiano, his favorite sauce) before him. A heavenly preparation. – Merrill Shindler

Atlanta Boston Chicago Las Vegas London Los Angeles Miami New York City Philadelphia San Francisco Washington, DC What's hot this fall? Casual dining is still on the rise, with top chefs forgoing fine china and white tablecloths for boozier, elbow-to-elbow environs (Daniel Boulud does a wine bar in NYC, Paul Kahan does a gastropub in Chicago, Tom Aikens does fish 'n' chips in London). Speaking of the new easygoing ethos, the burger craze that swept New York last year has arrived in San Francisco, where no less than five patty purveyors are expected to start grilling in the coming months. Meanwhile, celeb chefs continue to sprinkle their culinary pixie dust far and wide. NYC toques Laurent Tourondel and Charlie Palmer are expected to follow Mario Batali and Tom Colicchio to La-La Land. Coupling with luxe hotel chains – and the odd newfangled museum – are Eric Ripert (DC, Philly), Alain Ducasse (London, NYC), Michael Mina (Miami), Wolfgang Puck (Chicago, DC) and, last but certainly not least, Charlie Trotter, who will open two new restaurants in Chicago's forthcoming Elysian Hotel in '08, as well as a Vegas entry later this year. Montaluce Winery & Estates will be home to a new Italian restaurant, Le Vigne. photo: Chris Hornaday Atlanta Alon's Bakery and Market: After 15 years of running one successful bakery and market, owners Alon and Janine Balshan are preparing to open a second outpost this December near Perimeter Mall (4505 Ashford Dunwoody Rd.).

BLT Steak: Named not for the sandwich, but for \"Bistro Laurent Tourondel,\" this well-respected NYC beef house will start grilling before the year is out in the midst of the trendiest segment of the Sunset Strip. Whether or not Tourondel will follow with branches of BLT Prime and BLT Fish remains to be seen (8720 Sunset Blvd.). Bond Street: When the Beverly Wilshire is converted to a Beverly Hills outpost of New York's Thompson Hotel in mid-October, it will also boast a hot Manhattan culinary import – a branch of Jonathan Morr's highly rated nouvelle Japanese (9360 Wilshire Blvd.). Café R&D: Wolfgang Puck didn't make it in this (possibly cursed) space in Santa Monica, but that's not keeping the people behind Houston's from giving it a try with this casual Orange County–developed concept due to open any day now (1323 Montana Ave.). Charlie Palmer at Bloomingdale’s South Coast Plaza: The newly opened Bloomingdale's in Costa Mesa's South Coast Plaza will soon house another New York import, this signature restaurant and wine shop from Charlie Palmer – of NYC's celebrated Aureole – opening any day now (3333 Bristol St.).

Oh!: The renovation of the venerable Orchid Hotel will also see the creation of this new trendy tapas restaurant opening October 1st. Chef Corey Locker, who hails from Washington, DC's Kyma, will run the kitchen (819 S. Flower St.). Paper Fish: There was a time when the restaurant in this Beverly Hills office building space, generically called \"Maple Drive,\" was one of the hottest spots in town, but times change and so does taste, and Maple Drive closed last year.

Rivera: Nouvelle Latino legend John Sedlar returns in a joint Downtown venture with Bill Chait (Spark Woodfire) that uses Sedlar's middle name as its own.

STK Steakhouse: In the West Hollywood space that was very briefly Bridge comes a branch of New York's STK Steakhouse; it's due to open in late November (755 N. La Cienega Blvd.). Also in the works... Mark Peel (Campanile) has taken over the former Oasis space for a project that remains shrouded in mystery, though the assumption is that in the wake of his former wife, Nancy Silverton, opening Pizzeria Mozza, it probably won't be a pizza shop (611 N. La Brea Ave.) ... Some three years after his departure from Bastide, Alain Giraud is joining the owners of such trendy destinations as Pearl Dragon, Falcon and Voda to open a classic French brasserie in the 1929 Santa Monica \"Crocker\" Clock Tower building adjacent to the Third Street Promenade (225 Santa Monica Blvd.).

Back Forty: Think local, seasonal fare at this Alphabet City tavern with garden seating from Peter Hoffman of the eco-friendly Savoy; it's scheduled for October (190 Ave. B; 212-388-1990). Bar Boulud: The name of Daniel Boulud's Lincoln Center–area wine bar belies its serious food-and-wine program even if it is casual by Boulud standards. The cellar will boast some 500 wines, and \"reverse pairings\" will match the Burgundy-heavy list with a New French menu showcasing homemade artisanal charcuterie. Look for a November debut (1900 Broadway). Boulud is also planning a Lower East Side burger bar inspired by his signature patty at db Bistro Moderne (299 Bowery). Blue Ribbon Sushi Bar & Grill: October is the latest opening date being tossed around for this long-awaited Midtown outpost of Blue Ribbon and Blue Ribbon Sushi (it will combine elements of both) housed in Jason Pomeranc's forthcoming hotel at 6 Columbus Circle, which is still undergoing renovations. Brasserie Cognac du Monsieur Ballon: In November, Vittoria Assaf and Fabio Granato, the team behind Serafina and Geisha, will open this brasserie at 1740 Broadway in Midtown.

Bun: Now that he's no longer affliated with Bao Noodles and Bao 111, chef Michael Bao Huynh (Mai House) is setting up this SoHo noodles-and-small-plates spot with his wife, Thao Nguyen; expect it to hit the Downtown scene shortly (143 Grand St.; 212-431-7999). Cantina: Jason Swami, the house DJ responsible for the popular parties at Le Souk, is the mastermind of this Lower East Side Latino with consulting chef Jason Neroni (ex Porchetta); expect late-night hours and a clubby vibe when it opens in late September (29 Ave. B).

El Quinto Pino: This smaller spin-off of tiny Tía Pol will feature Spanish snacks like the ones served at Tia Pol's bar from 3 to 5 PM (think marinated olives, almonds, etc.), as well as some unique tapas dishes. Expect it to have a more casual bar atmosphere than its popular predecessor when it sets up shop at 401 W. 24th Street in October. Five Guys: Call it the gourmet burger backlash. This VA-based patty purveyor with new outposts in Brooklyn and Queens is coming to Manhattan, and you won't find Kobe on the menu, but rather, as one Zagat surveyor lovingly put it, a \"heart attack in a sack.\" No-frills digs are also part of the package, so it's no surprise the chain's first Manhattan branch is debuting in a former Chinese restaurant at 43 W. 55th Street. Grayz: It looks like Gray Kunz's long-awaited small-plates spot will finally see the light of day. Originally scheduled to open in fall of 2006, it's now set to debut in late September in the old Aquavit space, which is being restored to resemble its glamorous heyday as a Rockefeller residence. The swell surrounds will feature a private catering space for weddings and other functions (13-15 W. 54th St.; 212-262-4600). Ilili: Philippe Massoud (ex DC's Neyla) will debut this Gramercy Park Lebanese in October (236 Fifth Ave.; 212-683-2929).

Merkato 55: Chef Marcus Samuelsson (Aquavit) is readying this Meatpacking District entry inspired by his travels in Africa researching his book, The Soul of a New Cuisine: A Discovery of the Foods and Flavors of Africa. The restaurant, which borrows its name from a food market in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, will explore African cooking and its influences on the cuisines of the world, including the American South and Brazil. It's scheduled to open in October in the old Sascha digs (55-61 Gansevoort St.). Primehouse New York: Opening October 1st, this steakhouse from B.R. Guest Restaurants is setting up shop a few doors away from Dos Caminos; its steaks will be aged on premises in a salt-tiled room (381 Park Avenue S.; 212-685-3636). 2nd Avenue Deli: This iconic kosher deli closed in January 2006 after it lost its lease for the East Village space it had resided in since 1954. Fans of its famous pastrami, chopped liver and matzo ball soup can now rest easy – the Lebewohls will reopen in a Murray Hill location in October (162 E. 33rd St.). The Smith: From the owners of Jane, this New American is scheduled to debut in the former home of an East Village Uno Chicago Grill in November (55 Third Ave.). Smith's: An October launch is planned for this Greenwich Village American from Danny Abrams of the Mermaid Inn and Red Cat (79 Macdougal St.; 212-260-0100). Wildwood Bar BQ: Restaurateur Steve Hanson is a busy guy. He's opening Primehouse New York (381 Park Ave. S.) in October, then this BBQ spot in the old Barça 18 space in late October/early November. It will offer classic American 'cue in digs designed by David Rockwell. In other words, don't expect your run-of-the-mill roadhouse: think a 100-ft.-long bar, a \"BBQ friendly wine list\" and decor that brings an \"urban perspective to the classic barbecue joint\" (225 Park Ave. S.; 212-533-2500). Back to Top Eric Ripert is teaming up with the Ritz-Carlton Philadelphia. photo: Nigel Parry Philadelphia Azie: The crew from Teikoku is at it again with this Asian-International spot set to open in October (218 W. State St., Media). Beneluxx Tasting Room: Philadelphians appreciate their Belgian beer (see Eulogy Belgian Tavern, Monk’s, Zot), so it's no wonder Eulogy-owner Michael Naessens is readying another one. Slated to open in late September, Naessens will pair beer and wine with cheese and chocolate for lovers of all things Belgian (33 S. Third St., Old City). Bindi: Chef Marcie Turney and Valerie Safran, who own Wash West’s hot Lolita, are readying their new upscale Indian BYO for an October 19th bow (105 S. 13th St.).

Supper: Global Dish Caterers is entering the restaurant biz with this high-style South Street New American scheduled to open October 19th.

Swallow: Diners can expect this new Euro-style, mom-and-pop bistro in late September in Liberties Walk, the dining-shopping district in Northern Liberties (1030 N. American St.).

Stephen Starr is planning an unnamed gastropub on Chestnut Street as well as a bistro on 18th and Locust, both slated for April. Back to Top San Francisco Best-O-Burger: Fueling the fervor for fancy burgers, Mecca mavens Randy Lewis and Stephen Webber are hoping to flip open the doors of their mini-burger joint in the Financial District this November. The mostly take-out spot will sell bitty sliders by the bagful à la White Castle, only fashioned from Angus beef and fresh buns baked throughout the day (493 Pine St.). Burger Bar: In early 2008, Fleur de Lys chef-owner Hubert Keller will open this outpost of his red-hot Las Vegas restaurant either Downtown or in Union Square. Though the SF version will feature a larger wine list, much of the menu will mirror that of the original's, including the signature $65 Rossini Burger featuring Kobe beef, sliced foie gras and shaved Perigord truffles. Burger Joint: The simple, no-frills burgermeister with retro-looking outposts in the Mission, the Lower Haight and SFO’s International Terminal is expanding to meet the ever-growing desire for perfect patties. Come fall, look for a new branch across from the ballpark (242 King St.); the first South Bay branch will follow (1401 Burlingame Ave.). Camino: Russell Moore, Chez Panisse Café chef and produce buyer for more than a decade, plans to cast out on his own with this unique, rustic restaurant in Oakland scheduled for early next year. The focal point of the simple, brick-walled building will be an eight-ft.-wide fireplace (\"camino\" means fireplace in Italian) in which much of the evening's menu will be prepared. Moore will continue to source local ingredients for his Med-inspired country cuisine (think lamb à la ficelle hung over the fireplace, spit-roasted meats, grilled whole fish, beans baked in the coals, rabbit cooked in cazuelas), and hopes to purchase whole animals, then serve different parts on different nights (3917 Grand Ave.). Cellar360 San Francisco: This wine and culinary education center in historic Ghirardelli Square is slated to open October 1st with over 200 global wines available for tasting and purchase, a gourmet charcuterie bar, alfresco dining, wine country concierge service, book signings and culinary classes through an alliance with Copia, the American Center for Wine, Food & the Arts (900 N. Point St.). Fillmore Heritage Center: Yoshi’s (this time as Yoshi's Jazz Club & Japanese Restaurant) is poised to open its second Bay Area location at the Fillmore Heritage Center on November 28th (1330 Fillmore St.). Also at the Center, 1300 On Fillmore will feature French-soul food and is projected to open in late October. Fish & Farm: The forthcoming venture in the Hotel Mark Twain from junior generation restaurateurs John and Elena Duggan, whose grandfather founded the Tenderloin’s long-running Original Joe’s, is no longer going to be called Two Fathoms – it’s back to Fish and Farm and slated to open September 27th (339 Taylor St.). Flora: This October, Dona Savitsky and Thomas Schnetz, the duo behind the East Bay’s popular Tacubaya, are set to open their third venue, Flora, in the up-and-coming Uptown area of Downtown Oakland, recently designated as an entertainment zone. They will offer Californian comfort food and retro cocktails – a departure from their signature Mexican cocina (Telegraph Ave. and 19th St.). Gitane: Café Claude will soon have a new sibling and neighbor. Its name means \"gypsy,\" a nod to the menu's Southern Med influences, to be served amid funky-chic, circa-1960s decor. The space will also boast a heated enclosed patio (6 Claude Ln.). Horizon: The newest entrant in the burger wars is this gourmet burger joint and late-night spot slated to open in October in the old Sake Lab space in North Beach. Ola Fendert and Mark Bright of Oola and the forthcoming Local are consulting on the menu and wine list (498 Broadway). La Mar Cebichería Peruana: Come spring 2008, Peru’s most prominent celebrity chef, Gastón Acurio, is expected to show us how Nuevo Peruvian cuisine is really done when he opens the first U.S. branch of his internationally acclaimed seafood restaurant. Overlooking the Bay’s marina, the eatery is part of a $54 million waterfront renovation (Pier 1 1/2 along the Embarcadero). La Trappe Café and Bistro: On tap to open in late September or early October, this North Beach hofbrau will offer a selection of Continental pub grub designed to complement and soak up its Belgian- and Trappist-style suds (800 Greenwich St). Local Kitchen and Wine Merchant: This loungey localvore vino venue in SoMa slated for the end of September is the second project from Oola owners Ola Fendert and Maria Hilario-Fendert. They will oversee the regionally sourced Californian-Italian menu, designed with partner and sommelier Mark Bright’s (ex Michael Mina) global wine list in mind (330 First St.). Maritime East Restaurant: The owners of SF's Cafe Maritime are taking over the Berkeley space that most recently housed Zax Tavern and opening this new seafooder there in mid-October. While fish will be the focus, it will continue to serve Zax’s signature twice-baked goat cheese soufflé, much to the relief of neighbors who have depended on it for years (2826 Telegraph Ave.). Mint Plaza: A second branch of Chez Papa, the popular Potrero Hill bistro, is slated to open in late September in the newly constructed pedestrian alleyway behind the Old Mint (414 Jesse St.). Meanwhile, a fourth outpost of Sushi Groove will join the Jesse Street action in October, and later this year, expect a sit-down branch of Blue Bottle Coffee Co. (66 Mint St.). Rumors continue to swirl about a potential second branch of the Peruvian hot spot Limòn in the area. O Izakaya Lounge: Housed in the renovated Hotel Kabuki, this Japanese-style tavern and baseball-themed sports bar – named after the legendary baseball star Sadaharu Oh – is poised to open November 1st serving Japanese-inspired shared plates with a NorCal sensibility and a robust bar snack menu (1625 Post St.). Out the Door: Given that dining interest in Charles Phan’s Westfield Centre and Ferry Plaza branches of Out the Door has gone through the roof, it’s no surprise that the Slanted Door owner plans to open a third branch of this casual eat-in/take-out Vietnamese cafe and wine bar later this year or early next in Pacific Heights (2232 Bush St.). Oxbow Public Market: This mammoth emporium in Downtown Napa will showcase 35 specialty food retailers and organic farm stands, an 8,000-ft.-long deck overlooking the Napa River and a bounty of restaurants including a new Venezuelan eatery named Pica-Pica; Ria, an Italian wine bar/pizzeria from the Bistro Don Giovanni folks; and new branches of Model Bakery and Taylor’s Automatic Refresher. Taylor's will open November 15th, the rest on December 1st (610 First St.). Pickles: The venerable Clown Alley, purchased by Myth owner Tom Duffy, has been renamed Pickles, but the menu and decor won’t change until this winter. While not chichi, Pickles' patties will be a step up from its predecessor's, and most importantly, will still be served into the wee hours, along with Chicago-style hot dogs and signature frozen custard drinks (42 Columbus Ave.; 415-421-2540). Red Lantern: Former Viognier and Betelnut chefs will raise the culinary bar of Downtown Redwood City with this 120-seat restaurant showcasing Southeast Asian cuisine and decor, slated to open in mid-October (808 Winslow St.). Sens: Specializing in Southern Mediterranean cuisine (think Greek, North African and Turkish) from Michael Dotson (ex Evvia) and opening in late October, this 225-seat wood-and-stone venue will focus on local, sustainable produce and catch, along with biodynamic wines; they’ve tapped pastry-chef-around-town Shuna Lydon, who’s CV includes French Laundry and Citizen Cake (4 Embarcadero Ctr.). Shokolaat Restaurant: Never mind the funny spelling; think \"chocolate\" and you get the idea of what’s behind this forthcoming Palo Alto eatery, slated for mid-October. Run by chocolatier Mark Ainsworth and executive chef Shekoh Moossavi, the husband-and-wife team formerly behind Saratoga’s Restaurant Gervais, it will feature a menu of contemporary European small plates and decadent desserts. Its retail area will stock Ainsworth's fine pastries, artisan breads and gourmet chocolates (516 University Ave.; 650-289-0719). South: Food and Wine Bar: South Beach will get a taste of Down Under when this Aussie-backed food-and-wine bar opens October 1st. Luke Mangan, chef-owner of Glass Brasserie in the Hilton Sydney, will turn out authentic fare such as green-lipped mussels, barramundi fish, oysters, grass-fed sirloin and Kiwi lamb, while the decor will similarly reflect the bar’s provenance, with lots of jarrah (eucalyptus) and modern artwork (330 Townsend St.). S.P.Q.R.: Rome wasn’t built in a day and neither, apparently, was this forthcoming Southern Italy eatery named after the ancient moniker of the Roman republic. After a series of permit delays, it's now slated to open September 22nd. A 16 chef Nate Appleman will share the cooking duties with Daniel Holzman (ex Campton Place), dishing out rustic Roman fare with a focus on antipasti, fried items and pasta (1911 Fillmore St.). Also in the works... Thomas Keller was supposed to turn ad hoc into Burgers and Half Bottles, but the Yountville eatery was so successful he decided to make it permanent and look for another location for the burgers ... Slow Club chef Chris Kronner will help oversee the New American menu at a yet-unnamed venue in Dogpatch opening in November; the design team behind Spork and Range are hard at work restoring its future home in the former boiler room of a 1915 American Can factory ... Pat Kuleto’s sister waterfront restaurants Waterbar and Epic Roast House are now scheduled to debut around the first of the year (399 The Embarcadero). Back to Top Wolfgang Puck’s signature pizzas will be served in his forthcoming Newseum eatery, The Source. photo: Alex Berliner Washington, DC Agraria: In early 2008, this rustic New American will open a second location in Foggy Bottom featuring farm-sourced products from its Midwest co-owners as well as from local growers (1900 Pennsylvania Ave. NW). Bouche Bistro: This wine-centric Gallic proffering charcuterie, cheese and Eclectic small and large plates will boast dining and dallying options in the U Street Corridor when it debuts later this fall (1905 Ninth St. NW). Also in the works nearby is Cork Wine Bar, which features a similar concept and opening date (1720 14th St. NW). Domaso: When the new Hotel Palomar Arlington opens in November, it will house this vaulted-ceiling Italian named after the quaint fishing village on Lake Como (1121 N. 19th St.). The Source: Wolfgang Puck’s signature pizzas will be served at the entry-level bar/lounge of this Newseum dining venue when it opens in early October; upstairs, Puck’s Asian-accented New American dishes will be presented in a fancier atmosphere (555 Pennsylvania Ave. NW). West End, A Bistro by Eric Ripert: Slated for an October opening, this exciting new restaurant at The Ritz-Carlton Washington is being designed by Adamstein & Demetriou to exude a casual vibe – think upscale neighborhood watering hole; its Contemporary American menu will be designed by Ripert and executed by his sous-chef, Lenardo Marino, from NYC’s legendary Le Bernardin (1150 22nd St. NW).

Trend Watch: More Mac 'n' Cheese

***CONTENT
It's the cheesiest: the East Village's S'mac photo: Noah Kalina Mac 'n' cheese is a combo few would argue with but many are tempted to improve upon. Part of its appeal is that it lends itself to endless permutations that can be happily sampled around town, with more versions popping up every day. In November, the Mac Bar will set up shop in SoHo (54 Prince St.; 212-744-1600), dishing some 15 varieties and joining fellow one-hit wonders S'mac and Supermac. Meanwhile, creative twists on the comfort-food classic can be had at a number of popular eateries, including, among others, a luxe $55 version at Graydon Carter's Waverly Inn: \"Mac 'n' cheese pancake\" at Borough Food & Drink \"DuMac & Cheese\" (radiatore with cheddar, Gruyère, Parmesan, bacon) at DuMont \"Deep Fried Mac 'N' Cheese\" at Mo Pitkin's \"Crispy Mac & Cheese Rolls\" at 24 Prince \"Mac and cheese with fresh shaved black truffles\" at Waverly Inn

***CONTENT
New York's restaurant industry won a victory in court yesterday when a federal judge ruled that the city's fast food restaurants may not be forced to list nutritional information on their menu boards. For now. Judge Richard Holwell found in favor of the New York State Restaurant Association, which had sued the New York City Department of Health over a regulation dating to last December requiring fast-food restaurants who already made their nutritional information available elsewhere to post it on menu boards. The judge found that the new rule went beyond a 1990 federal regulation that already required the disclosure of nutritional information and therefore is preempted by federal law. The Health Department is expected come back and try to get the labels posted again. \"We are confident that calorie labeling can be legally mandated by the City and will help New Yorkers be better informed and make healthier choices,” said the Department in a statement.

On September 12th, Mexican staple Rosa Mexicano kicks off its 5th Annual Chocolate Festival with the addition of seven cocoa-based items to the menus at all three of its NYC locations. To kick off the festivities, which run through October 17th, chef David Suarez is offering a cooking demonstration and three-course luncheon on Saturday, September 15th, at the Union Square branch (10 AM cooking demonstration; 11:30 AM lunch; $55 per person; 9 E. 18th St.; 212-533-3350). The second StarChefs.com International Chefs Congress takes place September 16th–18th on the top two floors of 7 World Trade Center. This year’s ICC will feature live cooking demonstrations, hands-on workshops and smaller discussions led by top toques from around the world, including José Andrés, David Bouley, Wylie Dufresne and Joël Robuchon. Tickets are by invitation only and limited to food service industry professionals (for more information, go to www.starchefs.com) – but the public can get a taste of the action at its gala finale, the annual New York Rising Stars Revue. The dine-around event will feature pushcarts filled with high-concept street food from up-and-coming toques around town, all specially paired with cocktails and wine (September 18; 8 PM; $125 per person; $200 VIP admission is also available; Mansion, 530 W. 28th St.; to purchase tickets, go to www.starchefs.com). The same evening, the Four Seasons is hosting a 20th anniversary celebration of the James Beard Foundation; the dinner will highlight Beard classics and kick off a series of nationwide events (September 18; 7 PM; $500 per person; call 212-754-9494 for reservations). Ever wander around the Village unable to decide on a place to eat because they all look so good and you forgot your Zagat guide at home? Now you can sample a little bit from all of them. On September 18th, the Village Alliance will host the 5th annual \"Taste of the Village\" benefit for Washington Square Park. Located, unsurprisingly, in Washington Square Park, the event will feature samples of signature dishes from 15 local eateries including Blue Hill, Café Spice, Jack Bistro, North Square and Otto, along with beverages provided by IS-Wine, Anthony Road Wine, Fizzy Lizzy and the Brooklyn Brewery (6–8 PM; $40 per person; 212-777-2173). Finally, do you love pig? The folks over at Il Buco certainly do. In honor of the Autumnal Equinox, executive chef Ignacio Mattos will slow-roast a 160 lb. Ossabaw pig outside of the restaurant on September 20th (1–6 PM; $20 per plate; 47 Bond St.; 212-533-1932).

By Emily Capo A back-to-school guide to cheap eats in eight cities Cheap Eats Guide Boston Chicago Los Angeles Miami NYC Philadelphia San Francisco Washington, DC Dreading the return to your college cafeteria's meatloaf and mayhem? Eaten enough PB&J to last a lifetime? Going back to school may induce many anxieties, but fear of dining hall fare need not be one of them. Below is a selection of affordable, tasty and centrally located restaurants that double as weekend retreats from ramen and Easy Mac. Whether you're looking for something different to experience with a group of friends, a cozy nook to enjoy with a significant other or comfort food to battle homesickness, our back-to-school guide to cheap eats has you covered. Boston Basta Pasta 319 Western Ave.; 617-576-6672 Harvardites might feel betrayed if we tell Downtowners about this Italian secret in Cambridge, but they should really learn to share their (low-priced) pasta. Il Panino Express 264-266 Hanover St.; 617-720-5720 Cheap, tasty and reliable Italian food in the North End – what more could a college kid ask for? Pho Hoa 17 Beach St.; 617-423-3934 The huge portions of Vietnamese favorites at this Chinatown standby should give you a break from those dried noodles under your dorm bed.

Taiwan Cafe 34 Oxford St.; 617-426-8181 Take a walk on the wild side at this Chinatown Taiwanese eatery (stinky tofu and jellyfish salad, anyone?) affording a cheap way to experiment with a new cuisine. Chicago Big Bowl egg rolls Bella Bacino's 118 S. Clinton St.; 312-876-1188 If Giordano’s and Edwardo’s don’t tickle your fancy, the pizza and pasta at Bella Bacino’s in the West Loop might.

Third St.; 212-777-4425 If you don’t have access to a dorm kitchen to cook your own comfort food, a laid-back atmosphere and good ol’ home cooking can be found at this Lower East Sider.

Risotteria 270 Bleecker St.; 212-924-6664 Need to feed a hungry pack of friends? This Village Italian will please carnivores and veggies alike. Philadelphia Reading Terminal Market Lakeside Chinese Deli 207 N. Ninth St.; 215-925-3288 This Chinatown BYO is not a deli, nor is it by a lake. It is, however, famous for featuring the best dim sum in Philly. With those great prices, we don’t care what it’s called. Mama Palma's 2229 Spruce St.; 215-735-7357 Feel right at home in Center City West at this “mom-and-pop” Italian nook. Pho Xe Lua 907 Race St.; 215-627-8883 Delicious Vietnamese pho and prices that are a “steal” make this Chinatown eatery a magnet for students seeking a hearty meal and a good time.

Emporio Rulli 225 Stockton St.; 415-433-1122 Bring back Study Abroad memories at this lovely Downtown Italian offering “perfectly” crafted Italian favorites. Hunan Home's Restaurant 622 Jackson St.; 415-982-2844 Chinatown has many great restaurants, but play it safe and take your gang to Hunan’s, where the regulars are so loyal they claim, “I’d eat outside standing up.” Mo's 772 Folsom St.; 415-957-3779 1322 Grant Ave.; 415-788-3779 If a good burger is what you crave then you “gotta go to Mo’s” in North Beach and SoMa.

Enrico Malta's NYC Restaurant Group – which owns numerous Italian restaurants including Intermezzo, Il Bastardo and Sette – is in a flurry of construction with four new West Side eateries set to open in as many weeks, including its first Mexican. Just opened is Artevino, a 16-seat Italian small plates and wine bar next to the group's Arté Around the Corner retail shop. The wine license is due momentarily (274 Columbus Ave.; 212-875-2195). Then at the end of September come the other three, currently in construction in Hell's Kitchen: Lime Jungle, a Mexican takeout store, will feature empanadas and frozen drinks, as well as limited seating (803 Ninth Ave.; 212-586-6032). Gallo Nero, a 40-seat Italian grill, is set to take over the old Caribbean Spice spot on 44th Street (402 W. 44th St.; 212-265-6660). And finally La Bocca di Bacco, a 70-seat Italian, will offer over 40 wines by the glass. Chef Roberto Passon, who already has his own eponymous restaurant in the NYC Restaurant Group family nearby, will be in charge of the kitchen (828 Ninth Ave.; 212-265-8828).

***CONTENT
With Labor Day, and the end of summer, fast approaching, the food world is preparing to rev up for the new fall season. Here's a taste of what's to come in September. While continuing as chef at Keith McNally's Morandi, Jody Williams is prepping the opening – permits willing, sometime soon after Labor Day – of Gottino, an Italian wine bar on the same block as her alma mater, Gusto (52 Greenwich Ave.; 212-633-2590). Tony Fortuna's take on the steakhouse, T-Bar & Lounge, will replace his Upper East Side eatery Lenox Room shortly after Labor Day. Chef Ben Zwicker's menu will include a raw bar (1278 Third Ave.; 212-772-0404). The chef of the popular East Villager I Coppi will open a new restaurant of her own in mid-September named Matilda, combining Mexican and Tuscan cuisines (647 E. 11th St.). Gray Kunz's long-awaited small-plates spot, Grayz, will debut the week of the 17th (13-15 W. 54th St.; 212-262-4600), while Steve Hanson's Primehouse New York will open its doors on the 21st (381 Park Avenue S.). Going against the usual \"close/renovate in August\" grain, Flatiron staple Mayrose closes today for \"at least\" six weeks of renovations. It will reemerge as Lunetta, a sibling to the Italian-American restaurant in Boerum Hill (920 Broadway; 212-533-3663). Similarly, Park Avenue Summer will close on September 23rd; it will reopen on October 1st as Park Avenue Autumn, boasting a new seasonal look and menu (100 E. 63rd St.; 212-644-1900). Of course, a number of restaurants will spring into action in September. Fiamma reopens on the 17th with new chef Fabio Trabocchi at the helm (206 Spring St.; 212-653-0100). Midtowner Gilt returns from summer break on the 5th with an entirely new fall menu from toque Christopher Lee (455 Madison Ave.; 212-891-8100). And early in the month, Alex Ureña will reopen Ureña as Pamplona, a bistro specializing in Basque cooking (37 E. 28th St.; 212-213-2328). Finally, two oft-delayed bars are claiming post–Labor Day openings: Blue Seats, the American sports bar set to debut at 157 Ludlow Street, and Pacific Standard, a microbrew specialist at 82 Fourth Avenue in Park Slope.

By Garth Johnston Professor Brian Wansink explains why we eat more than we think Professor Brian Wansink at Cornell University's Food and Brand Lab. Courtesy of Cornell University Can a noisy restaurant make you drink more – or less? What's the psychology behind menu wordings? The man with the answers is Brian Wansink, a Cornell University professor in charge of that school's Food and Brand Lab, who released a book last October synthesizing his years of food and eating research into an easily digestible format. The result is Mindless Eating: Why We Eat More Than We Think, which came out in paperback on August 28th. In study after study, Wansink demonstrates that our perceptions of food are largely influenced by external cues, from the size of a serving bowl (the bigger it is, the more we eat), to a menu item's description (the fancier it is, the better the dish will taste), to the company we keep (we consume more with a companion than alone). Dr. Wansink recently took time out of his schedule to talk to Zagat Buzz about mindless eating and its impact on our diets, our dining experiences, even our public health policies. Zagat Buzz: In your discussion of the impact of menu descriptions in Mindless Eating, you point out that “Grandma’s Zucchini Cookies” will not only sell better than regular “Zucchini Cookies” but consumers will say they taste better. Do restaurants ever ask your lab with assistance in writing up menus? Brian Wansink: In a word, no. Because that’s not what the Lab is for. However, we’ve analyzed the names of foods in over 14,000 menus and for the most part they can be broken into four different categories. Geographic labels are one. Like I was in a restaurant last night that had \"Tuscan fries\" – and what the heck are Tuscan fries? – so that would be a geographic indicator. So could \"European-style green beans.\" Second would be sensory labels like \"juicy,\" \"plump\" or \"succulent.\" Things like that. Third would be traditional, or equity, labels like \"old-fashioned,\" \"old world,\" \"homemade\" or \"grandma’s.\" Fourth would be things that try to appropriate another brand, like \"Snickers pie.\" A lot of times restaurants will call us and then use those templates to build their menus. ZB: And in those 14,000 menus, what were the most egregious descriptors you found? BW: When they name dishes after people, that’s when the really egregious stuff happens. Like when you get a dish named after a woman – possibly the wife, possibly not – with something very amorous associated with it. Like “Judy’s succulent whatever” and it just makes you go “ugh.” Because these restaurants are these owners' babies, they don’t often realize that a dish named after a person, if you aren’t a regular, can just sound bizarre. Like \"Baby Mama’s Veggies\" – we actually saw that one on a specials sheet down in Memphis. ZB: Given the power of labeling, were you surprised by the recent study that found children preferred foods like carrots when packaged with McDonald's wrappings? BW: No, not at all. There are two really powerful things going on there they didn’t even measure. One, there is a guarantee anytime you have something that is branded. McDonald's or Fig Newtons, people are going to like it more because it is a guaranteed product with a multibillion dollar company behind it saying “this is acceptable.” The second thing is the relationship people have with McDonald's. This is the place where Happy Meals come from! I’ve never eaten at McDonald’s and been depressed, even as an adult. Every time I go there it makes me smile, let alone when you take your two-year-old daughter there. If you had called them “SpongeBob SquarePants Carrots” it would have the exact same effect. ZB: Your book talks about how no one is immune from these external cues – not even you. So what advice would you give to people who don't want to feel manipulated? BW: One thing we suggest is that nobody wants to go to a restaurant with somebody who just whines about being on a diet. They just ruin everybody’s time. So one of the things we tell people is to enjoy eating, just don’t over do it. If what you really want is filet mignon, get it. You can take half of it home with you when you are done, but if you don’t it can really make for a downer of a meal for everybody. The other piece of advice we like to give is the rule of two. There are a lot of ancillary items you can buy along with your main course. Appetizers, bread, desserts, drinks and so on. We tell people you can have any two items you want besides your main course, but that’s it. You want an appetizer and a drink? Fine, no bread. You want a second glass of wine? Fine, but don’t get anything else. We find that it actually really empowers people. ZB: Speaking of ancillary products, do people really not remember the bread they ate when you approach them after dinner? BW: Definitely. For most, it’s an almost subconscious activity. Especially when you look at everything else that happens during a meal. Often people will start off saying they aren’t going to eat any bread – so in their mind they made the decision not to eat bread. But then subsequently in conversation, or the middle of a salad, they’ll absentmindedly pick up a piece and eat it. And then when they’re done with the meal they will remember their decision not to eat bread and assume they didn’t. ZB: Has your lab done any studies on noise levels in restaurants? BW: Oh, yeah! We did a couple of them. In one... we took the normal ambient noise and magnified it through speakers. Then we tracked two things: The amount customers spent on food and alcohol and the amount of time they spent at the table. If I remember correctly, the average for dinner is about an hour and fifteen minutes without the noise, but a little bit over an hour with. So it can help a restaurant turn tables to have a noisy restaurant. But here’s where things really backfire: The amount that people spend on food was really similar in both cases, though it trended a little more when it wasn’t noisy – about two dollars more. But if it was not noisy a restaurant makes a lot more on alcohol. We were finding the average bill for alcohol was about 40 percent higher if it was a quiet place instead of a noisy place. People wanted to stick around longer and socialize. ZB: To move to a hot topic for food-types these days, what do you think of trans-fat bans? BW: The question is: Is it really going to change what people do? Like with product labeling. Most of what we’ve seen is that it doesn’t really have much of an impact and sometimes it can change people for the worse. It can lead them to put a health halo around a product to the point where they begin inferring a whole lot more health benefits to a product than it actually has. Like “oh, this is no trans fat, or this is low fat, therefore it must be lower in calories.” No! ZB: Finally, are calorie counts on menus effective in encouraging healthier dining habits? BW: It depends on how it’s done. Sometimes it can be very off-putting. We’re currently in the middle of a study in New York City with 100-calorie packages [since previous studies have shown that the larger the portion size, the more we tend to consume, some companies have begun selling snacks in smaller 100-calorie packages] and we’ve done pre-studies in four national chains but we don’t have too much information on that yet.

The Financial District space (60 Pearl St.), which should be open by early spring, will serve a compact menu of burgers and curries, each available in five versions: vegetarian, beef, lamb, chicken or fish. Just don't expect fluorescent lighting – the contemporary decor is to feature furniture handcrafted in Italy. Buddakan The latest big-budget restaurant set to make a splash in the Meatpacking District (75 Ninth Ave.) is this Asian fusion import from Philly scheduled to open in February. In a bid for downtown cachet, the building's purposely gritty exterior will yield to an opulent dining space. Cafe d'Alsace Simon Oren (Marseille, Nice Matin) turns to Alsace for his latest French foray, this Upper East Side brasserie (1695 Second Ave.) with a zinc bar and, to help patrons navigate the extensive roster of Geman brews, a \"beer sommelier.\" A late winter opening is planned. L'Atelier de Joël Robuchon The famed French chef is bringing a version of his Parisian hot spot – which marries Haute Cuisine and casual, countertop environs – to the Four Seasons Hotel (57 E. 57th St.) in March. As in Paris, the counter will be the restaurant's focal point, with an exposed kitchen that will be viewed through a see-through glass wall. But unlike the original's intimate, clubby setting, the NYC outpost will occupy a far grander space beneath I.M. Pei's soaring ceiling. Good Deals and Other News Cool Hunters The latest design trend to take hold of bars and eateries is to emulate the look of a rustic lodge. First, hip Downtown restaurants like Freemans on the Lower East Side took to displaying odd assortments of taxidermied animals and hangouts like Floyd NY in Brooklyn Heights dressed themselves up with mounted deer heads and wood paneling. Others soon followed, with the opening of Camp (more deer heads, a fireplace), Lodge (taking its cue from the Adirondacks) and Northeast Kingdom (inspired by the wilds of Vermont). The look has also climbed north: Chesea's Gstaad mimics a Swiss après-ski chalet and at newcomer Aspen, trendies tipple top-shelf hot toddies amid slick Lucite deer heads. Agnanti Meze A new branch of the Astoria taverna has opened in Bay Ridge (7802 Fifth Ave., 718-833-7033). Atelier Eric Branger, former executive chef of the Ritz-Carlton New Orleans, has replaced Alain Allegretti at this plush New French in the Ritz-Carlton Central Park. While Branger has added a few signature touches (crawfish soup, for example), the menu (à la carte or $125 for five courses) has not significantly changed. However, a reconcepting of the restaurant is in the works. Caviar Bar at Emperor's Roe The Caviar Bar at this new Harlem purveyor of gourmet goods (200 Lenox Ave., 212-866-3700) is opening later this month. Think samplers of imported caviar ($310 for 1 ounce each of Beluga, Osetra and Sevruga) and $160 bottles of Dom Perignon '96, not to mention $10 glasses of bubbly and a more modest American caviar sampler. Let the good times roll, indeed. Christos This Greek steakhouse is poised to reopen after extensive renovations by new owners. The warm earth-toned room will feature a larger bar area and a steakhouse menu that's now mainly American (some Hellenic influences will be felt on the appetizer list). A butcher shop will continue to operate out of the premises. Eleven Madison Park Daniel Humm, former executive chef of San Francisco's Campton Place, has been named as the replacement for chef Kerry Heffernan. He is expected to implement a new menu by late spring. Falai This creative Lower East Side Italian has opened a small full-service cafe and bakery down the block dubbed Falai Panetteria; it's open every day from 7 AM–11 PM, with extended hours on Friday and Saturday nights (79 Clinton St., 212-777-8956). Fifty Seven Fifty Seven Now that this New American in the Four Seasons has shuttered to make way for L'Atelier de Joël Robuchon (for more details, see the \"Coming Soon\" section above), regulars and hotel guests are heading instead to the recently opened Lobby Restaurant (57 E. 57th St.; 212-829-3859). The hushed, sophisticated space overlooking the hotel's grand lobby serves classic American cuisine at breakfast, lunch and dinner, including a signature Kobe beef burger. Giorgione Giorgio DeLuca (of Dean & DeLuca fame) has opened Giorgione 508, a new West SoHo branch of his Italian eatery (508 Greenwich St., 212-219-2444). The ambitious offerings include a retail area, nearly nonstop hours (6–3 AM) and American/British breakfast service. Mama's Food Shop This East Village comfort-food shop has opened Jah Mama, specializing in Jamaican cuisine, across the street (199 E. 3rd St., 212-228-2663). It will replace the sandwich shop Step Mama's. Manhattan Ocean Club While this midtown seafooder has closed, its owners are planning a new project for the space (57 W. 58th St.) that's slated to open in the spring. Maremma The menu at Cesare Casella's latest now features less \"spaghetti western\" cooking and more straight-ahead Tuscan fare. Megu The Japanese powerhouse is branching out: Megu Midtown will open at the Trump World Tower (845 United Nations Plaza) in February, while a third American location is scheduled to open at the end of 2007 in Las Vegas' forthcoming Trump International Hotel. Old Homestead Big spender alert: This Meatpacking District steakhouse is serving a whopping 32-ounce American Kobe beef bone-in filet for $125. Second Avenue Deli This quintessential East Village kosher deli has closed, reportedly due to a lease dispute. If a deal can't be brokered, its owners hope to revive it in a new location. Shelly's New York Shelly Fireman's retro steak and seafooder is moving a block east to the old Wolf's Delicatessen space at 41 West 57th Street. The slightly smaller venue will feature a new look, though the mountainous raw bar and some of the original artwork are expected to make the move. A spring opening is anticipated. Casa Mia Fifty Seven Fifty Seven Manhattan Ocean Club Miracle Grill (1st Ave. branch only) Sal Anthony's (Irving Pl. branch only) V Steakhouse

Broadway Manhattan 212-925-8510 Coming Soon Destino Pop singer–turned–restaurant investor Justin Timberlake will lend star power to this Midtown East Italian (891 First Ave.) from nightlife entrepreneur Eytan Sugarman (Suede, Cherry Lounge). Despite its Hollywood pretensions, expect a serious menu by Mario Curko (ex Rao's) when it opens later this month. It's not Timberlake's first foray into the hospitality industry – he also owned the trendy Chi nightclub on LA's Sunset Strip. Dona After scores with davidburke & donatella and Ama, restaurateur Donatella Arpaia is turning her attention to her original venture: the eight-year-old Bellini (208 E. 52nd St.) is closing the third week of February to make way for this Modern Med with a menu by chef Michael Psilakis, who took Greek cuisine in new directions at Onera. A late March opening is planned. El Centro Now that taquitos are all the rage Downtown (see: La Esquina, El Bocadito), the craze for Mexican street food–style snacking is spreading: the owners of Hell's Kitchen, the popular upscale Mexican eatery, will open their version of the genre later this month on the site of the old Vynl Diner (754 Ninth Ave.). Noodle Bar Quentin Danté and Ten Vong – the pair behind the successful but short-lived Yumcha – turn from Haute Chinese cuisine to retro Asian eats at this noodle shop set to open in Greenwich Village (26 Carmine St., 212-524-6800) in early February. Though the concept finds its inspiration in 1950s Hong Kong, the menu's ingredients and prices will be thoroughly modern (broth noodles range from $9–$14). Pier 2110 This forthcoming Harlem seafooder (2110 Seventh Ave., 212-280-PIER) will feature colorful aquatic decor (including two waterfalls and a boat hull hanging from its ceiling), a menu with soul food and Asian influences (spicy shrimp with soba noodles, brook trout stuffed with crabmeat and served with creamy grits) and a bar/lounge area serving specialty cocktails and a late-night menu; slated to open in mid-March. Pre:Post Opening late this month on the same West Chelsea block as BED, Bungalow 8 and Cain, this American restaurant and lounge (547 W. 27th St.; 212-695-7270) will cater to clubbers with an after-hours \"room-service\" menu comprising breakfast items and other comfort-food fare. Lunch and dinner service and hours that stretch from 11–9 AM are also planned. Also Coming Soon ... at the Time Warner Center: After the high-profile closure of Jean-Georges Vongerichten's V Steakhouse, the town's most luxurious food court (10 Columbus Circle) is aiming to democratize its dining. New tenants will include a fourth-floor bar and grill helmed by chef Michael Lomonaco (ex Guastavino's, Windows on the World) that's modeled after Boston's Grill 23; a third-floor branch of TriBeCa's popular Landmarc; and Bouchon Bakery, the long-awaited, more affordable entry from Thomas Keller that will soon serve soups, salads, sandwiches, pastries and chocolates on the third floor (212-317-2348). Good Deals and Other News Alto Autographed copies of chef Scott Conant's recently released New Italian Cooking are available for purchase ($35) both here and at L'Impero. Antonucci This Upper East Side Italian trattoria is now open for lunch; brunch service is expected to be added later this month. Bao Noodles New winter dishes include Vietnamese tomato soup (fresh tomatoes, scallions, sliced beef, chicken broth) and night market noodles (thick rice noodles with sliced Vietnamese ham, bean sprouts, sweet fish sauce, lettuce and daikon). In addition, this casual Gramercy eatery now accepts reservations and credit cards. Bette Amy Sacco's chic boîte now serves daily afternoon tea from 3–5:30 PM; tea for two ($60) includes assorted finger sandwiches, cakes and scones with clotted cream, raspberry jam and passion fruit curd and a choice of more than a dozen brews. Bombay Talkie A new late-night \"street bites\" menu is served from 11 PM–1 AM Sunday–Tuesday and 12–2 AM Wednesday–Saturday. Snacks include an assortment of dosas (stuffed crêpes) and kathi rolls (flatbread wraps). Brasserie Recently appointed chef Franklin Becker (ex Trinity, Capitale) has introduced new lunch and dinner menus featuring classic dishes with modern twists, including sea scallops and pork belly confit with sunchokes and red wine–truffle vinaigrette, and Long Island duck breast with confit spring rolls, foie gras, berry compote and orange-coriander sauce. Faves like steak frites and onion soup will remain untouched. Brasserie Aix Didier Virot's French Upper Westsider has a new name and a new, simplified menu offering plats du jour such as bouillabaisse, coq au vin and smoked Peking duck. 'Cesca Tom Valenti has left this Southern Italian to focus full-time on Ouest. Chef Maria Rizzo will continue to run the kitchen at 'Cesca; meanwhile, the branch in Atlantic City has closed. Compass Chef John Fraser – the latest toque to take charge of this West Side New American – has introduced a new winter dinner menu featuring dishes such as parsnip and Granny apple soup with raisins, pumpernickel bread and brown butter, and roasted Atlantic monkfish with split pea puree, Tuscan kale, fall radishes and Greek sausage vinaigrette. Country Geoffrey Zakarian has opened Cafe at Country 's more formal companion piece; located upstairs, it's a luxe setting for a prix fixe–only New American menu comprising four courses for $85. D'or Ahn This cool Korean is now serving a late-night menu of its signature fusion fare from 11:30 PM–2:30 AM Thursday–Saturday. Dishes will be conducive to sharing and include oyster three ways. Kitchen 82 Charlie Palmer's reasonably priced New American on the Upper West Side has closed; Kitchen 22 remains open. Lavagna This East Village Italian's prix fixe menu is now offered Sundays only (5–7 PM); the price, which includes three courses, is $29 per person. Les Halles February is \"Choucroute Month\" at both locations of Anthony Bourdain's brasserie; four different choucroute dishes – including a classic choucroute garnie – will be served alongside an Alsatian wine list. Lure Fishbar A fire has temporarily closed this handsome SoHo seafooder. The owners hope to have the space shipshape and reopened by early summer. Pair of 8's Monday night at this new Upper West Side eatery/wine bar is \"Neighborhood Night\" – $25 buys you an appetizer and an entree (both from a choice of three), as well as a cocktail, wine or beer. Or splurge on a wine flight constructed from the more than 30 wines served in two-oz. tastes. Philippe This modish new Chinese puts on a twice nightly \"Noodle Show\" (around 8 and 9:30 PM), during which diners can watch chef Wai Ming Cheng ceremoniously pull noodles in the midst of the restaurant's dining room. Chef Cheng's noodles are served either \"Singapore-style\" (with shrimp, pork, scallions, bean sprouts and peppers in a curry sauce) or in a special pork bean sauce; both dishes are priced at $14 and are meant to be shared by several guests. Rare Bar & Grill The new Greenwich Village branch (228 Bleecker St., 212-691-RARE) of this Murray Hill patty purveyor may not feature a rooftop bar, but it does offer a \"Murray's Cheese burger\" topped with a weekly changing fromage from Murray's down the block. Sushi Sen-nin A new branch has opened at 30 E. 33rd Street (212-889-2208).

A retail counter will sell French pastries plus soups, salads and sandwiches made from premium ingredients, while cordoned off in the third-floor lobby area will be a 60-seat full-service cafe with an espresso and wine bar and views of Central Park. Degustation Grace and Jack Lamb are turning the tiny space adjacent to Jewel Bako into this 16-seat bar offering French and Spanish small plates that's scheduled to open in April (239 E. Fifth St.; 212-979-1045); the couple's previous attempts at remaking the room include the short-lived Grace's Kalbi Bar & Korean Cuisine and Jewel Bako Robata. Ditch Plains After floating Landmarc Oyster Bar and Watermarc as potential names for their forthcoming Greenwich Village oyster bar (29 Bedford St.), Marc and Pamela Murphy of TriBeCa's popular Landmarc have settled on Ditch Plains – a reference to the über-cool surfers' beach out in Montauk. Expect it to roll in early spring. Japonais The latest chic Japanese out-of-towner to give Gotham a go (see also: Morimoto) is this Chicago hottie famed for its sexy decor and even sexier clientele. Whether or not it impresses the locals will be seen in the spring, when it opens off a stretch of Park Avenue South (111 E. 18th St.) that's already pulsing with the arrivals of Barbounia and Barça 18. Megu Midtown Billed as a boutique version of Megu, this spin-off of the TriBeCa Japanese powerhouse will feature a new menu (a few of the signatures will remain) and a smaller, more intimate room outfitted with rich fabrics, chandeliers and a large-scale tiger mural. There will also be outdoor seating and a dining-room cart from which guests will be able to choose their meal's ingredients; slated to open in late March on the ground floor of the Trump World Tower (845 UN Plaza). Nomad Tagines and other North African dishes will be on offer at this East Villager (78 Second Ave.; 212-253-5410) with an outdoor garden and a wine list that wanders from Algeria and Morocco to California and Israel; opening in early March. Quality Meats The Smith & Wollensky Restaurant Group has hired trendy design firm AvroKO (Public, Stanton Social) to remake the Midtown space that was once the Manhattan Ocean Club (57 W. 58th St.) into an industrial yet inviting setting for contemporary twists on classic steakhouse selections (Caesar salad, steak tartare); scheduled to open in the spring. Setacci Spigolo's Joey D'Angelo will bring his innovative Italian cooking to Greenwich Village (420 Hudson St.; 212-675-0810) by month's end; the restaurant, done up in warm tones of chocolate and pistachio, will feature a raw bar and cocktails mixed with fresh juices. Tokyo Pop The owners of the Upper West Side's Café du Soleil are opening this casual Japanese eatery across the street (2728 Broadway; 212-932-1000). The affordable menu will feature sushi, as well as the kind of everyday snacks found in a Japanese pub or izikaya, all served in an airy, modern setting with cartoon-style art in the spirit of Takashi Murakami; slated to open in late March. Good Deals and Other News Gone But Not Forgotten The old is constantly making way for the new in this town, and in recent months, a particularly large number of venerable dining institutions have shuttered, including Bill Hong's (1955), McHales (1953), Second Avenue Deli (1954) and Ye Waverly Inn (1920). Tableside Service Takes Off Once the jurisdiction of old-timers like Sardi's and 21, tableside service is now in vogue at the city's newest fine-dining destinations. The house salad on the set menu at Country is preciously prepared in view of diners; the servers at Del Posto wheel around everything from a mixed grill for six to an old-fashioned cookie cart; and at Morimoto, an army of servers offer stagy flourishes, even going so far as to mold and set fresh tofu tableside. Barbounia This popular Med newcomer has added lunch and weekend brunch service. Beppe Cesare Casella is no longer a partner in this Flatiron Northern Italian; instead, he's focusing full-time on Maremma and revamping its menu to better reflect the Tuscan touches for which he's known. Blue/Green The Dumbo location of Matthew Kenney's vegetarian cafe is now offering a Friday night prix fixe raw-food dinner menu for $40. Craftbar The menu at Tom Colicchio's more casual New American eatery has been rejiggered, with prices now topping out at $20 for a main course of roasted pork with capers, golden raisins and roasted vegetables. Hampton Chutney Co. This Indian fusion eatery has opened a new branch on the Upper West Side (464 Amsterdam Ave., 212-362-5050). Hearth Marco Canora's East Village Tuscan-American is offering Monday night wine dinners built around a region or grape. Upcoming editions will focus on Northern Rhône (March 13th; $150), Shiraz (March 20th; $195) and Châteauneuf-du-Pape (March 27th; $210) bottles and will pair each of four courses with one or two wines (7 PM; 646-602-1300); prices include tax and gratuity. HQ This SoHo New American now serves brunch seven days a week, including lobster Benedict ($15) and a bananas Foster Belgian waffle with vanilla ice cream ($10). Ideya Chill out at this SoHo Caribbean's monthlong \"Reggae Sunday Brunch\" featuring $4 Red Stripes and old-school roots reggae. Jean Georges Jean-Georges Vongerichten is now running Restaurant Week promotions year-round at all of his NYC restaurants, with $24.07 prix fixe lunches offered at Jean Georges, JoJo, Mercer Kitchen, Perry Street, 66, Spice Market and Vong; 66 also serves a $35 prix fixe dinner. March Book a private luncheon or dinner at this East Side New American through April and receive 15% off the food portion of your bill. Mexicana Mama A new cash-only branch of this Nuevo Mexican has opened at 47 E. 12th Street (212-253-7594). Myriad Restaurant Group Drew Nieporent's restaurant group has opened Proof on Main in Louisville, Kentucky (702 W. Main St., 502-217-6360); the American menu will feature Tuscan influences and local, seasonal ingredients, complemented by an extensive bourbon list and served in a room filled with contemporary art. Rain To celebrate its 10th anniversary, this Pan-Asian Westsider has freshened up its menu and decor. Riingo Marcus Samuelsson's New American–Japanese is serving a $35 three-course pre-theater menu throughout the month of March. Serafina After closing for renovations, the Lafayette Street branch has reopened in more intimate (read: smaller) digs; to celebrate, it's offering a complimentary tiramisu with the purchase of lunch or dinner throughout the month of March. Tasting Room This tiny East Villager has expansion plans. Come late spring, it will open the Tasting Room Restaurant in the space that was Soho Cantina (174 Elizabeth St.), where it will quadruple its seating and boast a full liquor license; the original Tasting Room Wine Bar and Cafe will switch to a simpler, less expensive menu. Telepan Bill Telepan's seasonal New American fare is now being served at lunch and weekend brunch; new dishes include The Upper Westsider (smoked salmon, whitefish salad and gravlax with soft scrambled eggs; $21) and a hen-of-the-woods panini ($17.50). Tocqueville This acclaimed French-American off Union Square has relocated down the street to tonier digs at 1 E. 15th Street; the larger, more refined appointments feature a lounge and private upstairs dining room. Owners Marco Moreira and Jo-Ann Makovitzky plan to turn the original space into a brand-new restaurant with a more affordable menu offering sushi.

Maxwell's Steakhouse A large-scale mosaic mural will be the focal point of this new steakhouse opening the second week of April in Rockefeller Center (57 W. 48th St.). Chanto In early April, this upscale Japanese will launch in the Greenwich Village space that was most famously home to Moomba (133 Seventh Ave. S.; 212-463-8686); its parent company owns several restaurants throughout Japan. Dressler The folks responsible for hipster hot spots DuMont and DuMont Burger are opening their third Billyburg venture (149 Broadway) this month; it too will specialize in New American cuisine. Grayz Gray Kunz (Café Gray) will give small plates a classic New York spin at this forthcoming lounge in the old Aquavit space (13-15 W. 54th St.), which is being restored to resemble its glamorous heyday as a Rockefeller residence.

This saucy eatery, slated for a September opening in the former Houlihan's space (729 Seventh Avenue), featuring David Burke (davidburke & donatella) as consulting chef.

This month, Gavroche will open its secret garden seemingly miles away from the bustle of 14th Street, and on April 17th, Tabla will open its patio featuring views of Madison Square Park. Speaking of the park, Danny Meyer no longer owns alfresco dining in this part of town (see also: Shake Shack) now that Andrew Carmellini's new restaurant, A Voce, is about to unveil a lemon tree–lined piazza outside its Madison Avenue digs; it's scheduled to open by the end of April. Ama Donatella Arpaia has sold her interest in this SoHo Puglian to chef Turibiio Girardo; her new Mediterranean restaurant, Dona, recently opened at 208 E. 52nd Street. Aroma This NoHo Italian wine bar offers three tastes of wine and a plate of antipasti for $15 Tuesday–Friday from 5–7 PM; antipasti selections change daily. ChikaLicious On June 1st, this East Village sweet spot will move to larger digs at 212 E. 10th Street (roughly triple the size of the original with 60 seats); at that time, the E. 12th Street location will become limited to takeout. Craftbar Craft's more casual sibling now serves weekend brunch starting at 10 AM; dishes include chickpea pancakes with smoked salmon and crème fraîche ($12) and crispy pork terrine with farm eggs ($12). Daisy May's BBQ USA This BBQ specialist is expanding in April to feature a dining room seating 40; a wine and beer license has been approved and hours will be extended, including the addition of weekend service. Diner 24 Despite its name, this Chelsea American is now open 24/7 Thursday–Sunday only; Monday–Wednesday, it's 9 AM–1 AM. Earl Monroe's Now that Earl Monroe has pulled out, this Harlem New Southerner has been renamed The River Room. Four Seasons Executive chef Christian Albin's new spring menu features such seasonal dishes as kampachi and bluefin tartare with ginger, wasabi and jalapeño ($26), shad and roe with crisp bacon and orange-caper sauce ($37) and spring rabbit with sausage, morels, asparagus and polenta ($38). Freemans This hip Lower Eastsider off Freeman Alley is expanding to the Chrystie Street side as part of a face-lift that's expected to be completed this month; the original space will continue to operate during the renovations. Heartland Brewery The South Street Seaport branch is now known as Heartland Brewery & Barbecue; replacing the pub grub is a BBQ menu lifted from sister restaurant Spanky's BBQ. Jacques A new branch of this French bistro has opened in NoHo at 20 Prince Street (212-966-8886), the former home of Porcupine and Mix It. JoJo Sunday brunch is now offered at Jean-Georges Vongerichten's modern French bistro; served from noon–2:30 PM, it features à la carte items such as potato pancakes with smoked salmon and crème fraîche ($15), as well as a $24.07 prix fixe lunch menu that includes a choice of two small plates (the long list of choices includes goat cheese fondue, warm asparagus, foie gras brulée, black bass and peekytoe crabmeat). Jolie This Boerum Hill French bistro offers a four-course tasting menu for $25 on Monday nights. Maya To celebrate its 10th anniversary, this upscale Mexican Eastsider has spruced up its menu and decor; new dishes include spice-marinated duck with ancho-fruit mole ($24). Poke The new digs (343 E. 85th St.) of this East Side Japanese has triple the seating of the original. Saigon Grill This pair of popular Uptown Vietnamese restaurants is opening a Greenwich Village branch this spring at 91 University Place. San Domenico Restaurateur Tony May and brother Mimmo Magliulo have signed a lease for the ground floor of the Columbia University School of Social Work (1255 Amsterdam Ave.); plans for the public space are still being hammered out but will encompass what May calls \"a total food experience – Italian, of course.\" A fall opening date is scheduled. Scottadito Osteria Toscana As befitting a restaurant a few doors down from the Park Slope Food Co-op, the menu at this Tuscan has been updated to feature more organic and locally farmed ingredients. 66 A new take-out menu at Jean-Georges Vongerichten's TriBeCa Chinese features roasted Peking duck ($23) and chile prawns with lily bulb and sweet walnuts ($22). Tintol This new Portuguese wine and tapas bar is luring Times Square clock-punchers with a lunch menu of larger entree-size dishes; choices include a ham and cheese sandwich ($10), pork tenderloin with clams ($16) and beef tenderloin with papas bravas ($22). Banania Cafe Blue Star Oyster Bar Cyclo Della Rovere 14 Wall Street Restaurant French Quarter Il Menestrello Kelly & Ping (Third Ave. branch only) 71 Clinton Fresh Food Shorty's on the Half Shell Via Emilia

Chat Noir This French bistro (22 E. 66th St.) will need no letter of introduction to le tout Madison Avenue – one of its owners is the former general manager of fashionable La Goulue . A September debut is planned. French Connection Simon Oren, who owns Café d'Alsace, Marseille and Nice Matin among other French eateries, has several new projects opening soon. Next to Marseille on Ninth Avenue will be Nissa, a Mediterranan cafe serving sandwiches, pizzas and the like, opening in July. At Port Authority (8th Ave. and 41st St.), he is partnering with Steve Tenedios of the Café Metro chain on Metro Marché, a French brasserie opening in August. And in October, Oren's shuttered Brothers Bar-B-Que at 225 Varick Street in the West Village will reopen as La Moelle, a country French steakhouse. A bit of trivia: the Varick venue was once home to the high-end restaurant Rakel, the original stomping grounds of celeb chef Thomas Keller before he went west to launch French Laundry. FR.OG The oddly punctuated name stands for \"French Origin,\" the common influence that will be felt in all of Didier Virot's global dishes (sautéed black sea bass with coriander and garlic, roasted chicken with toasted peanuts, etc.). The Aix chef is setting up shop in a duplex SoHo space (71 Spring St.), located across the street from Balthazar, in the fall. Japonais The latest imported behemoth to give Gotham a go is this Chicago hottie famed for its sexy decor. When it settles into Gramercy Park (111 E. 18th St.) later this month, expect spins on sushi and other dramatically presented Japanese fare, not to mention five dining and lounge areas. P*ONG Pastry chef Pichet Ong (Spice Market ) strikes out on his own with this sweet-and-savory West Village dessert bar (150 W. 10th St.) in the vein of ChikaLicious and Room 4 Dessert ; it's scheduled to open in the fall. Trestle on Tenth This West Chelsea New American (242 10th Ave.), whose name nods to the nearby Highline, will feature a walled garden and hearty, Swiss-influenced cuisine by chef-owner Ralf Kuettel (ex Zoë ). Special emphasis will be placed on the wine list: Kuettel was the wine buyer of the Chelsea Wine Vault and his wife is the beverage director of Gramercy Tavern. A July 10th opening is planned. Wicker Park The cuisine at this Upper Eastsider (200 E. 83rd St.), scheduled to open on July 7th, will revisit Continental-American classics, while a sidewalk cafe will provide additional seating. Good Deals and Other News Anzu Lannie Ahn has replaced D'or Ahn, her Korean fusion restaurant, with this new spot offering more affordably priced sushi and Japanese small plates (207 10th Ave.; 212-627-7777). Look for more information on Anzu in the August ZagatWire. Bar With No Name Last month, this laid-back Meatpacking District bar began serving Mediterranean cuisine. Owned by the folks from Barolo and I Tre Merli, it is planning to emphasize its food service and could soon receive an actual name. Beacon Waldy Malouf now serves a casual continental brunch on Sundays (10:30 AM–2:30 PM) featuring unlimited coffee, espresso drinks and pastries, plus fresh juice and housemade granola and yogurt for $14.95 per person; more substantial dishes and brunch cocktails can be added on. Caracas Arepa Bar This Venezuelan East Villager has opened a new branch (93 1/2 E. 7th St.; 212-228-5062) two doors down from the original. The new 34-seat venue will serve dinner and weekend lunch, while the smaller original will focus on takeout and delivery. District Recently appointed chef Patricia Williams (formerly of Morrell Wine Bar & Cafe) has cooked up a new seasonal menu at this Times Square New American; dishes include paillard of chicken with heirloom tomato salad and basil oil ($14) and asparagus black trumpet risotto ($18). Dos Caminos A sprawling Midtown branch is planned for the fall at the corner of 50th Street and Third Avenue. 5 Ninth Get ready for \"Chefs From Hell Tuesdays\" – a late-night party for the restaurant industry featuring an open Leblon caipirinha bar in the garden from 11 PM–1 AM. The Hideaway On Monday nights through Labor Day, this upscale TriBeCa lounge serves steamed and chilled Maryland blue crabs (three \"oversized\" specimens for $19) paired with $5 pints of Sam Adams Summer Ale. Jefferson Seafood This West Village New American has taken another culinary turn – this time from small plates and skewers to seafood. Jovia Josh DeChellis has departed from this Italian-accented New American. A replacement has yet to be announced. La Goulue Chef Christian Delouvrier (formerly of Alain Ducasse) is teaming up with this Madison Avenue bistro to open La Goulue Christian Delouvrier in Bal Harbour, Florida (Bal Harbour Shops, 9700 Collins Ave., Ste. 135; 305-865-2181), later this month. Le Gamin The 132 W. Houston Street location of this bistro chainlet has reopened after several other restaurants (Le Quinze, Manon) failed to gel in its spot. Shake Shack Danny Meyer has equipped the Shack with a Web cam so that patrons can check out the lines before heading to Madison Square Park. To view the cam, go to www.shakeshacknyc.com/camera.html. Stone Park Café Speaking of alfresco dining, this Park Slope New American is now the concessionaire for the summer entertainment series in JJ Byrne Park (Fifth Ave. and Third St. in Park Slope): bring a picnic blanket and a bottle of wine, watch free movies and concerts and order noshes such as crudité and short rib tamales. For a complete entertainment calendar, go to www.theoldstonehouse.org. Tasting Room Later this month, this tiny East Villager will open a new, larger location at 174 Elizabeth Street, where it will boast a full liquor license. The original space, to close temporarily, will reopen in August with a simpler, less expensive menu. Via Emilia This cash-only Italian has moved to a bigger, more modern space at 47 E. 21st Street (212-505-3072). Look for more information on Via Emilia in the August ZagatWire.

It's scheduled to open mid-summer. Cluny Named after a small Burgundy town famous for its old medieval abbey, this French-American bistro from Lynn Wagenknecht (the owner of cult classics Odeon and Cafe Luxembourg) will feature a menu modeled on the Odeon and similarly sophisticated yet simple Greenwich Village surrounds (284 W. 12th St.); a late July opening is planned. Lollipop Expect a Euro crowd to descend upon this sib (27 E. 61st St.) of East Side Prada magnets Geisha and Serafina when it debuts in July. A techno-pop lounge specializing in Thai-Vietnamese small plates (including skewered shrimp, lobster and Kobe-style beef \"lollipops\"), it will feature nightly DJs and a digital video installation that captures and projects guests' silhouettes. M & R Bar-Dining Room The folks behind retro Downtown haunt Marion's Continental are reviving this former Elizabeth Street lounge in the neighboring cellar space (356 Bowery; 212-260-1890) that was last home to The Slide; no doubt a similarly fun-and-freewheeling crowd will swing by for Eclectic small plates coupled with extensive wines by the glass when it opens on June 8th. The Standard André Balazs is planning a 2008 opening for the Meatpacking District outpost (13th St. at Washington Ave.) of his hip hotel chain; like its LA and Miami counterparts, it will house a chic restaurant that's destined to become a refuge for the willowy. Good Deals and Other News Hamptons Happenings Looking to leave the city? For the latest developments in the East End's dining and clubbing landscape, click here. Agata & Valentina Food Bar Enjoy a summertime happy hour at this Upper East Side Italian from 5–8 PM on Thursdays and Sundays, when complimentary appetizers (grilled antipasti, mozzarella di bufala, etc.) can be savored alongside specialty cocktails like the limoncello sorbet martini. Asiate There are now seafood ($35) and vegetarian ($28) versions of chef Nori Sugie's bento box lunch ($38) sampling the chef's signature dishes; a wine or sake pairing can be added for $15. Biltmore Room Chef Gary Robins is no longer affiliated with this Chelsea looker and the entire space is now a bar/lounge; its future remains unclear. Bobby Van's Grill A new Midtown West branch (135 W. 50th St.; 212-957-5050) features a broader menu than its East Side sibs, with sandwiches, pizzas and pastas supplementing the steaks; the space is also outfitted with a 75-ft. marble bar. Bouterin This Provençal farmhouse by way of Sutton Place has opened a sister restaurant, Café Soleil, offering more casual all-day French fare, including raw-bar selections (1016 Second Ave.; 212-758-1351); look for more information in the July ZagatWire. Cité The popular unlimited wine dinner at this Midtown steakhouse can be ordered during all dinner hours through Labor Day (usually it is available only after 8 PM Monday–Saturday and after 5 PM on Sundays). The $69 three-course deal features a choice of any appetizer, entree and dessert on the regular menu, not to mention bottomless glasses of selected wines, including a 2003 Vieux Lazaret Châteauneuf du Pape. Fig & Olive This Mediterranean Upper Eastsider has plans to open a megabranch in November 2006 at 201 W. 13th Street in the same building that houses Buddha Bar. HQ Tuck into a Monday night clambake at this stylish SoHo bistro; the $37.50 three-course menu features a one-and-a-half-pound steamed lobster with Ipswich clams, mussels, chorizo, corn on the cob and new potatoes. Kittichai A new $20 three-course prix fixe lunch is served daily at this Thai trendsetter; there is also a $30 pre-theater prix fixe offered Sunday–Thursday from 5:30–7 PM. Lo Scalco Is closing on June 15th; the TriBeCa Italian plans to reopen in a Midtown location early next year. Lure Fishbar This handsome SoHo seafooder now boasts a bona fide sushi bar manned by chef Tanaka Shigenori, formerly of Hatsuhana, Sushi Yasuda and Jewel Bako; the new sushi selections are offered in addition to chef Josh Capon's fin fare. Minnow Temporarily closed for renovations, this Park Slope fish house is expected to reopen sometime this month; in the meantime, its full menu can be had at the neighboring Bar Minnow (444 Ninth St.; 718-788-4376). The Place This romantic West Villager is battling to renew the lease on its original W. Fourth Street site; fans of the restaurant can show their support by signing a petition at www.savetheplace.com. Sapa The new happy-hour menu (offered daily from 5:30–7:30 PM) at Patricia Yeo's Flatiron French-Vietnamese features all kinds of neat noshes, including oyster shooters with sake, white soy sauce and fresh wasabi ($2), mini steak sandwiches ($4) and BBQ pork won tons ($3). Savoy After 6 PM, the first-floor cafe of this SoHo greenmarketeer serves a daily selection of small plates priced at $6, $9 or $12; choices might include \"a bit of cheese\" ($6), roasted asparagus ($9) and a selection of Mediterranean dips ($12). Sea Grill A new menu of light bites is available evenings out on the patio, including sushi, sashimi and other \"Sea Side\" fare, not to mention retro desserts such as funnel cakes and ice pops. 718 B-klyn Diner Is the new name of the Billyburg Italian formerly known as Miss Williamsburg. Tournesol This authentic Long Island City bistro is planning to open an adjacent wine, cheese and oyster bar later this summer. Triomphe Lighter, seasonal choices dominate the new summer menu at this Theater District New French, including sections dedicated to small plates, salads and seafood-centric entrees. Ureña Weekend brunch (11 AM–4 PM) is now served at Alex Ureña's modern Spaniard; dishes include a duck confit and morcilla omelet ($14) and a poached egg served on a biscuit with chorizo cular and hollandaise sauce ($12). Vento Small plates seem to be all the rage this summer, when emptier-than-usual rooms mean restaurateurs don't mind customers lingering over snacks. Fittingly, the new menu at this Meatpacking District Italian features imported cheeses ($4 each), cured meats ($6 each) and other casual nibbles. Village From June 5th–18th, this Greenwich Village bistro celebrates summer's bounty in a five-course menu culled from the Union Square Greenmarket; the $42.50 meal includes dishes such as Boston lettuce, asparagus and sorrel soup with truffle butter, and sautéed spring chicken with purslane, fava beans and chanterelles. 'wichcraft Tom Colicchio's growing sandwich shop chainlet now counts a Greenwich Village branch (60 E. Eighth St.; 212-780-0577).

It will have 120 seats, a renovated rustic interior and Mediterranean cuisine. Next door at 3385 Broadway will be two take-out spots: Vinegar Hill, a bread market and gourmet shop, and Tres Pasos, serving Mexican burritos. The E.U. Bob Giraldi and Jason Hennings had hoped to open this East Village gastropub (235 E. Fourth St.; 212-254-2900; Mai Housewww.theeunyc.com) last spring, but faced a number of stumbling blocks obtaining a liquor license, largely due to pressure from the Village community board. Following months of petitioning and negotiating with the board, the E.U. has finally nabbed a beer and wine license and will reopen this month with a new chef. Lonesome Dove Western Bistro A NYC outpost of Ft. Worth's celebrated Southwestern restaurant – a showcase for chef Tim Love's cowboy fusion cooking (roasted garlic-stuffed beef tenderloin with western \"plaid\" hash, grilled New Zealand red deer chop, etc.) – is in the works; the Flatiron District eatery (29 W. 21st St.) should be ready to welcome curious city slickers the week of September 18th. Designed and built by Love, it will feature a semi-open kitchen, a New World–centric wine list and a downstairs wine cellar with a table that holds up to 25 for private dining. Mai House In October, Drew Nieporent and Bao Noodles chef-owner Michael Huynh will open this 125-seat Vietnamese restaurant at 186 Franklin St., located on the same block as Nieporent's Tribeca Grill. Park Chinois Alan Yau – the high-profile restaurateur behind London hot spots Hakkasan and Yauatcha – is the creative force behind this modern Chinese eatery opening later this fall in the Gramercy Park Hotel (2 Lexington Ave.; 212-920-3300). The authentic, regional cuisine will showcase the flavors of Shanghai, Szechuan and Beijing, served in a chinoiserie-style setting that will also offer dim sum, Chinese high tea and late-night cocktails. Porter House New York Michael Lomonaco's American grill is slated to open this month in the former V Steakhouse space in the Time Warner Center (10 Columbus Circle, 4th fl.), where it will feature a menu specializing in grilled meats and fish. Initially open for dinner only, it will eventually serve lunch, as well as late-night meals at its large bar. Russian Tea Room The third incarnation of this illustrious restaurant is opening in October in the original 150 W. 57th St. location. The building has remained untouched since the Warner LeRoy edition shuttered in 2002 (plans for a PGA museum having never materialized), as has its opulent gilded interior. The latest version will offer Continental dining on two floors, with two levels of banquet space above. Good Deals and Other News A Voce Don't have a reservation for Andrew Carmellini's popular Madison Square Park Italian? The tables in the recently opened sidewalk cafe are available on a first-come, first-served basis. District On weekdays, this Times Square New American offers a $20 three-course prix fixe lunch (noon–2:30 PM; price excludes tax and gratuity); the menu changes daily but might include dishes such as crispy grits with shrimp, corn and chanterelles in a lobster sauce or steak tartare with quail eggs and toasted brioche. Gilt Paul Liebrandt is out as chef of this NY Palace Hotel entry and Christopher Lee (formerly of Philly's Striped Bass) is in. Currently in soft-opening mode, the restaurant will officially reopen on October 3rd with a New American menu, a \"smart casual\" dress code and desserts by new pastry chef Nicholas Morgenstern (ex Gramercy Tavern). A bar menu has also been added. Gramercy Tavern Tom Colicchio has ended his partnership with Danny Meyer to focus on his expanding Craft empire. Executive chef John Schaefer, Colicchio's longtime right-hand man, will continue to run the kitchen until a replacement is found. In addition, a new pastry chef, Nancy Olson (ex Dona), was recently brought in. Gusto Chef Amanda Freitag (formerly of Sette Enoteca e Cucina) has been hired to replace Jody Williams, who has left this hip Village hang to helm Morandi, Keith McNally's forthcoming Italian bistro at 15 Charles St. In other news, Gusto owner Sasha Muniak is planning to open an as-yet-unnamed modern Italian at 74 Seventh Ave. S. in November. Jack's Luxury Oyster Bar Has moved to 101 Second Ave., where its decor (red-and-white gingham) and small size (24 seats) remain intact. The menu is still French-Continental seafood, now parceled into small plates by new chef Brendan McHale. As a result, prices are considerably lower: for example, the five-course tasting menu, previously $75, is now $50. Jewel Bako The menu is now broader, with dishes from the recently shuttered Jewel Bako Makimono merged into it. Lentini Later this month, the owners of this Upper East Side Italian are transforming it into the more casual and affordable Tini; the menu will emphasize seafood, complemented by raw-bar offerings and an extensive cocktail list. Megu Midtown Lunch is now being served at this scaled-down spin-off in Midtown's Trump World Tower. In addition to the à la carte menu, there's a $20.06 bento box consisting of eight chef selections that comes with soup and salad and a complimentary dessert. Oceana The restaurant is seeking a new executive chef following the departure of Cornelius Gallagher, who is now the top toque at Sonnier & Castle, a catering company. Peacock Alley On September 10th, the Waldorf-Astoria will begin serving its famously decadent Sunday brunch – which features everything from caviar and oysters to a beef Wellington carving station – in its Peacock Alley restaurant (10:30 AM–2:30 PM; $75 per person, excludes tax and gratuity; 212-872-7335). Persepolis This East Side Persian is moving down the block to 1407 Second Ave. Philly Slim's Cheesesteaks Has opened a new location at 106 University Pl. (212-989-8281) in Greenwich Village. Picholine Terry Brennan's Lincoln Center standby is reopening mid-month after temporarily closing for renovations. Most notably, the front bar will be transformed into a wine and cheese room serving a variety of small plates, wines by the glass and suggested flight pairings with Max McCalman's cheese selections. Pietrasanta A takeout-shop spin-off of this Hell's Kitchen Italian has opened by South Street Seaport at 88 Fulton St. (212-693-2600). Thor Kurt Gutenbrunner has departed from this trendy Lower East Side hotel eatery, where the kitchen will continue to run under the current staff. Tony Luke's This cheese-steak specialist (576 Ninth Ave.; 212-967-3055) has reopened after renovating over the summer; it features new decor and a liquor license. Look for more details in the October ZagatWire. Two Boots A branch of this pizzeria is scheduled to open in December at 384 Grand St. on the Lower East Side. 'wichcraft Tom Colicchio's rapidly growing chain of sandwich shops has opened a new outpost at 106 Crosby St. (212-780-0577).

Fireside Four fireplaces, classic cocktails and Eclectic small plates by chef Sam DeMarco (formerly of the East Village's First) will set the mood at this entry in the Omni Berkshire Place (19 E. 52nd St.) opening in October. Fireside Gordon Ramsay at The London: Brit bad-boy chef Gordon Ramsay will make his stateside debut with this fine-dining restaurant akin to his eponymous London flagship, opening in November at The London NYC Hotel (née Rihga Royal Hotel, 151 W. 54th St.). An adjacent bar and lounge, dubbed The London Bar, will offer a small-plates concept similar to his Maze. Gus' Place This popular Greek restaurant in Greenwich Village, which closed at 149 Waverly Pl. in October 2004, will return in November 2006 at 192 Bleecker St., off 6th Ave. It will feature a sidewalk cafe and 65 seats, with Gus Theodoro returning as chef-owner. Waverly Inn In October, Vanity Fair editor Graydon Carter and partners Sean MacPherson and Eric Goode (The Park) will revive this Greenwich Village tavern (16 Bank St.), which dates back to the 1840s and features a garden and four working fireplaces. Good Deals and Other News Alain Ducasse Ducasse is closing his Jumeirah Essex House outpost on or before January 15, 2007. He plans to open a new, soon-to-be-named restaurant in the St. Regis in March 2007, in the storied space that was Lespinasse, which is getting a makeover by David Rockwell. The forthcoming venture will feature cooking by chef Tony Esnault, private tasting rooms and a wine bar. Aquavit Chef Marcus Samuelsson has published a new book on contemporary Pan-African cooking entitled The Soul of a New Cuisine: A Discovery of the Foods and Flavors of Africa; it aims to demystify the continent's culinary traditions, which remain obscure despite far-reaching influences on everything from Southern American to Brazilian cuisines. Bayard's Is now open for private parties only; Bayard's Blue Bar continues to operate Tuesday–Saturday. Blaue Gans Through October 15th, celebrate Oktoberfest at Kurt Gutenbrunner's Austro-German bistro with steins of imported German brews, menu specials (extra-large homemade pretzels, roasted chicken, etc.) and traditional oompah music. Bouchon Bakery Handmade chocolates are now available at Thomas Keller's casual Time Warner Center to-go counter, where they can be purchased individually ($2.25 each) or in boxes of six ($19) or 12 ($36). Flavors include épice (dark chocolate ganache with Indonesian cinnamon, Madagascan vanilla and Mexican chiles) and lemon verbena (milk chocolate ganache with fresh lemon verbena from South America). Café Gray In a tradition he started back in 1995 at Lespinasse, chef Gray Kunz will serve an \"Indian Summer\" menu until at least mid-October. Bridging summer and fall will be dishes such as kalamansi-cured kampachi with soba noodles and flying fish roe ($24) and lamb roulade with fingerlings, cauliflower and red curry ($38). Carl's Steaks This cheese steak specialist has opened a concession in Yankee Stadium, located on the Field Level at Gate 4. Dos Caminos In mid-October, Steve Hanson will open Dos Caminos Third, a new outpost of his popular Mexican at the corner of 50th Street and Third Avenue (825 Third Ave.); it will feature three full bars specializing in tequilas and margaritas and a patio located on 50th Street. Gramercy Tavern New executive chef Michael Anthony hails from Blue Hill at Stone Barns, where he worked closely with chef-owner Dan Barber to create hyper-local, seasonal cuisine. He is expected to introduce his first menu in the new year, after the busy holiday season is over. Jazz Standard The Jazz Standard Youth Orchestra will perform on Sunday afternoons (1–3 PM) starting October 22nd as part of this Gramercy club's \"Jazz for Kids\" program. Parents with children ages four and up are welcome to attend; a $5 donation benefits the Jazz Standard Discovery Program, which teaches NYC school children about jazz music. Jovia Eben Copple, who has worked as chef de cuisine at Lidia's in Kansas City and sous-chef at Barbuto, has replaced Josh DeChellis as executive chef of this Upper East Side restaurant. Copple's new Italian-accented American menu includes a more extensive steak selection and pastas such as rock shrimp raviolini. Le Cirque Sirio Maccioni's Bloomberg Building power player now offers a more casual dining area centered around the wine tower dubbed \"The Cafe at Le Cirque.\" Both reservations and jackets are optional, and guests can order off either the simpler, less expensive cafe menu or the main menu. Megu Midtown Afternoon tea is now served weekdays from 2:30–4:30 PM; priced at $38 per person, it features Japanese savories, Japanese and Western pastries and one selection of tea. À la carte options are also available. Morimoto A new weekday lunch menu (noon–2:30 PM) offers bento boxes, rice bowls, scaled-down portions of signature dishes (sea bass, braised black cod, prime strip steak, etc.) and lighter options like ramen soup and sashimi salad. Nicky's Vietnamese Sandwiches This tiny sandwich shop has opened a second branch at 311 Atlantic Ave. in Boerum Hill (718-855-8838). With 16 seats, it offers almost triple the seating of the original. Periyali This Flatiron Greek has reopened with a new chef (James Henderson, ex Amuse), marble bar and skylight, plus fresh-looking white-on-white decor. San Domenico After a summer hiatus, chef Odette Fada's Sunday brunch menu (11 AM–3 PM) is back; specialties include purgatorio (eggs poached in a tomato and oregano sauce) and incapriata (puree of fava beans with steamed dandelions and peperoncino-flavored olive oil). Sascha Namesake toque Sascha Lyon has left this Meatpacking District bistro, but the restaurant's name, kitchen staff and GM remain the same. SushiSamba The Seventh Avenue South branch offers a guided sake tasting and roll-your-own sushi class every Monday through November (7–9 PM; $70 per person; 212-475-9377). Sweet Melissa Like its Cobble Hill counterpart, the new Park Slope branch (175 Seventh Ave.; 718-502-9153) of this bakery/tearoom offers garden seating. Tabla On Sunday evenings through December 17th, guests in the main dining room who order a bottle of wine will receive a second bottle of identical or lesser value for free (diners may choose a more expensive bottle, but they must pay the difference). wd-50 Chef Wylie Dufresne has cooked up three new dishes based on ongoing research in his kitchen/lab. Bacon, egg and cheese features cubed and brined pork belly slowly cooked in fat for 40 hours (because of the recent health-department ban on the sous vide cooking method); pine-nut cassoulet uses pine nuts cooked in a pressure cooker for a beanlike consistency; and squab, coconut pebbles and sassafras transforms sassafras into a meringuelike substance similar to the head on a root beer. Mainland Quartino (Peck Slip branch only) Uovo

It will serve lunch, dinner and weekend brunch when it opens mid-month. The House In December, this International wine bar/restaurant will open in a three-story Gramercy carriage house dating back to 1854 (121 E. 17th St.). It will feature an oyster bar as well as chef's tables on the third floor, plus a sidewalk cafe. There are also plans for a daily game menu and a rotisserie. Next Up From Boulud Daniel Boulud is opening an Upper West Side wine bar (1900 Broadway) across the street from Lincoln Center in late spring 2007. Though casual by Boulud standards, it should be to a wine bar what db Bistro Moderne is to a bistro. The list will lean toward Burgundy, with a private \"Cave\" dining room accessed through the wine cellar and a \"Tasting Table\" in the main dining room that sits up to 20 people. \"Reverse pairings\" will match the wine list with a New French menu focusing on homemade charcuterie. Provence Vicki Freeman and Marc Meyer of Five Points and Cookshop will reopen this SoHo perennial – which closed on October 14th after 20 years of business – on January 15th, 2007, with local, seasonal Provençal cooking from chef-partner Lynn McNeely (formerly of Barbuto). Ray to Open a Burger Joint? Celebrity chef and \"Queen of Quick\" Rachael Ray is reportedly opening a burger joint in NYC. According to MediaBistro.com, Ray told an audience at the American Magazine Conference in Phoenix on October 22nd that the yet-to-be-named eatery will serve 190 of her burger recipes. \"We'll rotate them,\" she said. \"Tuna burgers, swordfish burgers, turkey burgers ... I like anything you can pick up with your hands – portable food.\" Good Deals and Other News Truffle Time Again Truffle season is in full swing, with the prized white Piedmontese specimen gracing menus across town. A two-pound beauty from Alba, Italy, was scored by Iron Chef Masaharu Morimoto (for which he paid $10,500) – shavings of it grace his seven-course \"omakase truffle menu\" ($295 per person) at Morimoto. If you're feeling as extravagant as Morimoto, you can indulge in an eight-course tasting menu with white truffles in every course at the Sea Grill for $1,000 per person (two-person minimum). Meanwhile, $70 will buy you a liberal sprinkling of white truffles on any à la carte dish at Alto; a three-course \"white truffle lunch\" is also available for $100 – a comparative bargain. Or tuck into daily specials like white truffle lasagna or white truffle risotto at Andrew Carmellini's A Voce. Finally, through early December, add truffles to any dish at San Domenico for $6 per gram (a 4–5 gram serving per dish is suggested), while at Gusto, enjoy the delicacy à la carte or as part of a three-course menu ($120). Baluchi's The local Indian chain plans to open a second Brooklyn outlet (no date set yet) in Park Slope at 310 Fifth Avenue, replacing its Smith Street location that closed in Carroll Gardens last spring. Barbounia This Flatiron Mediterranean has done some slight remodeling, with the feathery chandelier banished, and the lounge area with couches up front replaced by a large communal table with high chairs. Blair Perrone Steakhouse Through November 30th, this Midtown steakhouse is offering a $24.06 prix fixe lunch menu to benefit the Save the Children Foundation. The three-course meal includes a choice of baked clams or fried calamari, mixed baby greens or beefsteak tomato with onion, and entrees such as a prime dry-aged 8-oz. filet mignon or grilled salmon steak. Brooklyn Diner USA A new Times Square location of Shelly Fireman's American diner (155 W. 43rd St.; 212-265-5400), opening this month, will feature the same menu and retro decor as the original. Bungalow 8 Club queen Amy Sacco will sprinkle some of her celebrity pixie dust in London next year, when an offshoot of her hot boîte opens in the St. Martin's Lane Hotel (45 St. Martin 's Lane, WC2). Sacco is expected to oversee the opening, which is slated for March or April 2007. Café Boulud To celebrate the publication of his new cookbook, Braise: A Journey Through International Cuisine, chef Daniel Boulud is offering a special three-course lunch featuring recipes from the book, served weekdays throughout November from noon–2:30 PM. The $60 price tag includes a signed copy of the cookbook. Crumbs Bake Shop A new flagship location of this nostalgic kosher bakery is opening in early December in Greenwich Village (37 E. Eighth St.), where it will feature cafe seating for 45, WiFi access and a tapas dessert menu in the evening. Da Noi A new location of this Staten Island Northern Italian has opened at 138 Fingerboard Road (718-720-1650). David Burke at Bloomingdales David Burke now caters from his Bloomie's cafe; interested parties should call Sandy Lee at 212-705-3800. Masa This Time Warner Center Japanese – the most expensive restaurant in the United States according to Zagat surveyors – recently instituted a $50 price hike, raising the base price of Masayoshi Takayama's kaiseki-style menu to a whopping $400 per person (that's before drink, tax and tip). Metrazur Through December, Charlie Palmer is offering a \"World Wine Saturdays\" deal from 5–10:30 PM. The $39 three-course meal features entree choices such as filet mignon and morel-dusted sea scallops, as well as a bottle of wine for every two guests – diners have a choice between a 2004 Russian River Valley Chardonnay or a 2000 Geyser Peak Winery Shiraz. Pó Stephen Crane, owner of this Greenwich Village Italian classic, is opening a second location in Cobble Hill partnered with his general manager, Jonathan Casteel, who will run the new operation. Chef Lee McGrath will be in charge of the menus at both. The new outpost is scheduled to open in late November at 270 Smith Street, between Degraw and Sackett streets. Porter House New York Michael Lomonaco's American grill in the Time Warner Center has begun serving lunch. Punch The second-floor lounge at this Flatiron Eclectic is reopening on November 15th as Wined Up, a wine bar offering 30 pours by the glass. Tamarind A new \"Executive Lunch Menu\" features three courses – including entrees such as baked fillet of red snapper served with a plum and coconut tomato sauce and chicken served with fiery Kohalpuri sauce – for $21.50; it's served daily from 11:30 AM–3 PM. The Alamo Anzu Bouterin Chemist Club Grill Columbus Bakery (1st Ave. branch only) Emack & Bolio's (Astoria branch only)

Anthos Midtown's critically acclaimed Dona shuttered prematurely last month, so it's a good thing Michael Psilakis and Donatella Arpaia already had this Modern Greek project in the works. Meaning \"new beginning\" or \"blossoming,\" it will feature an haute Grecque menu similar to the one offered at Psilakis' Upper West Sider, Onera (which recently tranformed into the more countrified Kefi), now to be served in a larger, grander Midtown setting (36 W. 52nd St.) with a pink-hued cherry blossom theme. It's slated to open late this month. Blue Ribbon Sushi Bar & Grill Summer 2007 is the latest opening date being tossed around for this Midtown outpost of Blue Ribbon and Blue Ribbon Sushi (it will combine elements of both) housed in Jason Pomeranc's forthcoming hotel at 6 Columbus Circle, which is still undergoing renovations. Meanwhile, Blue Ribbon Downing Street Bar (34 Downing St.; 691-0404) is set to open its doors early this month. The Inn LW12 The next \"inn\" spot to open Downtown (see Waverly Inn, Beatrice Inn) is this three-story Meatpacking District newcomer (7 Ninth Ave.) from nightlife vet Jeffrey Jah (Lotus) and scenester Lyman Carter that's scheduled to open in late February after being in the works for quite some time. The kitchen will get a boost from culinary consultant Daniel Boulud, who's recruited Andy Bennett, former sous-chef at Daniel, to craft a European gastropub menu featuring, as one flack described it, the kind of cuisine you'd get if a \"really good English cook studied in Paris.\" Patina Joachim Splichal's LA flagship will find an East Coast home in Lincoln Center, where it will open in 2009 as part of a redevelopment plan keyed to the center's 50th anniversary. Open to the public for lunch, dinner and post-theater noshing, the New American restaurant will be one of nine new dining options in the complex, with entrances on 65th Street as well as the plaza. Second Avenue Deli This iconic kosher deli closed in January 2006 after it lost its lease for the East Village space it had resided in since 1954. Fans of its famous pastrami, chopped liver and matzo ball soup can now rest easy – the Lebewohls will reopen in a Midtown location (162 E. 33rd St.) this summer. Wild Salmon The Pacific Northwest will inspire Jeffrey Chodorow's latest, to replace English is Italian when that restaurant shutters on March 17th at 622 Third Avenue. Chef Charles Ramseyer hails from Ray's Boathouse in Seattle, and will craft a menu showcasing regional ingredients including the namesake wild salmon. Expect an April opening. Also Coming Soon The owners of Lotus are keeping very busy. While Jeffrey Jah readies The Inn LW12 (see above listing), partners David Rabin (also the prez of the New York Nightlife Association) and Will Regan are cooking up their own project, a Meatpacking District Mexican scheduled to open in early April in the former Meet space (71-73 Gansevoort St.). Rabin tells ZAGAT.com it will be \"casual, authentic, accessible\" – stay tuned for more developments. Good Deals and Other News Café Gray A new $62 three-course prix fixe menu is available weekdays from 5:30–6:30 PM and weekends beginning at 5 PM; entrees include coconut-coated black bass, spiced venison medallions and braised short rib of beef. Guests who are in a rush are invited to come back to the restaurant after the show to enjoy dessert. Café St. Bart's This New American restaurant at St. Bartholomew's Church will remain open while it gets a revamp under new management; its spiffier digs are to be unveiled in fall 2007. Cercle Rouge New chef Pierre Landet's updated brasserie menu is complemented by a Monday night wine promotion featuring 50 percent off bottles from a weekly changing region. Del Posto Recently arrived pasty chef Nicole Kaplan, formerly of Eleven Madison Park, has unveiled a new dessert menu featuring the likes of panettone with candied orange, sour cherry and lemon butter, and Crostata di Nocciolo with hazelnut praline and milk chocolate crema. A new seasonal enoteca menu offers an edited selection of antipasti, pastas, entrees and desserts, as well as assorted wine and cheese pairings from Piedmont ($30) and a $41 prix fixe menu that must be ordered by the entire table. Landmarc Marc Murphy's popular TriBeCa bistro has expanded its weekend hours and brunch menu; it now offers dishes such as eggs en meurette (with bacon, mushrooms, onions and red wine) from 9 AM–4 PM. Le Cirque New executive chef Christophe Bellanca hails from L'Orangerie, LA's bastion of fine French dining, which shuttered on January 1st. He has introduced an entirely new menu, though the cuisine is still modern French with international influences. London Bar Gordon Ramsay's more informal dining alternative in the London Hotel offers daily tea service from 3–5:30 PM featuring assorted teas, sandwiches, scones and pastries for $35 a person. Patina Restaurant Group Through March 11th, purchase any bottle of red wine and receive 25 percent off and a \"Pocket Guide to Wine\" from Wine Enthusiast Magazine; the \"Savor the Reds\" offer is available at all Patina Restaurant Group restaurants, including Brasserie 8 1/2 and Sea Grill. There's been no further word from the Smith & Wollensky Restaurant Group on the hostile takeover bid that was recently launched by the Texas-based Landry's Restaurants Inc. (owner of the Chart House and Rainforest Cafe chains, among others). On January 12th, the NYC-based steakhouse chain, whose portfolio also includes Park Avenue Cafe and Quality Meats, received what it called an \"unsolicited, highly conditional proposal from Landry's ... to acquire the company at $7.50 a share.\" Company spokesperson Allison Good had no comment, though S & W has issued a release stating it is evaluating the proposal via a special committee. Tasting Room The cramped original space at 72 E. First Street has morphed into a casual wine bar/cafe with just five tables. Tribeca Grill On Mondays beginning February 12th, guests are invited to bring wines from their cellar without paying a corkage fee; there is a one-bottle limit per customer and a $10 per person service charge for parties of five or more.

The forthcoming venture will feature cooking by chef Tony Esnault, private tasting rooms and a wine bar. Lola After a two-and-half-year hiatus, this raucous Southern stalwart is reopening in early March 2007 in new SoHo digs (15 Watts St.; 212-675-6700), where it will feature a Cajun-Creole menu crafted by Top Chef season one finalist Dave Martin, live jazz and R&B music and the return of its popular Sunday gospel brunch. Nish This month, Wayne Nish will transform March, his East Side special-occasion destination (405 E. 58th St.) that shuttered on January 1st, into this more casual New American with a greater emphasis on à la carte dining, though it will continue to offer a four-course dinner option. Hearth Chef Marco Canora is cooking up a new project in the Michelangelo Hotel (152 W. 51st St.) in the former Limoncello space, which has been totally gutted. The concept behind the Italian menu is old world meets new world – one section will offer fairly straightforward preparations, the other more experimental dishes merging Italian cooking techniques with seasonal, less traditional ingredients, including some reinterpretations of classics (think saltimbocca made with fish instead of veal). The restaurant will also do a snack menu for the hotel's lobby bar. An opening is planned for February or March. Also Coming Soon An East Village \"gastrosaloon\" from restaurant vets Robert Larcom (Myriad Restaurant Group) and Gregg Nelson (Dylan Prime, Devin Tavern) will debut in the old Detour space (349 E. 13th St.; 212-533-6212) this winter. Though primarily a restaurant, its American bistro fare will occasionally be supplemented by live music. Good Deals and Other News Big Apple Burger Binge Gourmet burger emporiums have sprung up seemingly overnight. At Chelsea's brgr, the patties are made from \"Montana Legend all-natural Angus beef\" and can be topped with everything from crumbled Roquefort to radish sprouts. BLT Burger and Greenwich Village's hip new Stand further indulge diners with boozy ice-cream milkshakes. Over in Park Slope, Burger Bar recently set up shop at 444 Ninth Street (718-832-5500), where it replaces BarMinnow (look for more information on Burger Bar in next month's ZagatWire). And a Chelsea outpost (265 W. 23rd St.) of Burgers & Cupcakes is poised to open in early January, when the original Garment District location will revert to Mitchell London. Del Posto Wins Lawsuit Since NYC's Del Posto opened in December 2005, the Batali-Bastianich newcomer has battled its landlord, who has accused it of illegally installing equipment in the basement of its West Chelsea premises. Now, a year later, a civil suit has been settled in favor of the restaurant, ruling that it is within its rights to use the space for compressors and storage. However, Del Posto's legal woes aren't over yet – a State Supreme Court case is still pending. NYC Trans-fat Ban The artery-clogging trans fats found in partially hydrogenated vegetable oil will soon be banished from NYC restaurants. On December 5th, the NYC Health Department voted to ban artificial trans fats in city eateries, from fast-food joints to temples of haute cuisine. Restaurants will have until July 1st, 2007, to rid trans fats from its frying oils, with total elimination due by July 1st, 2008. Atelier This New French oasis in the Ritz-Carlton Central Park is closing after service on Thursday, January 4th; it will be replaced by Laurent Tourondel's BLT Market in the spring. Blue Smoke After closing for some light renovations on New Year's Day, Danny Meyer's Gramercy smokehouse is scheduled to reopen on January 15th. While diners won't notice any changes, downstairs at the Jazz Standard there will be a bigger, more welcoming bar and a vastly increased beer, wine and bourbon selection. Café d'Alsace Through January 9th, this Yorkville brasserie is serving the traditional French Galette des Rois or \"King's Cake\"; the person who finds la fève (good luck charm) in their cake is crowned King or Queen for the day. Charles' Southern Style Kitchen A new branch of this Harlem soul food spot has opened at 308 Lenox Avenue (212-722-7727). Dona Barely a year old, Donatella Arpaia's Midtown Med is losing its lease and closing after service on Saturday, January 6th; a new location is currently being sought. Gramercy Tavern A vintage beer and cider menu is now offered in the dining room and tavern. Since it has a higher alcohol content, a 12-ounce bottle of aged beer can be split among several people and enjoyed as an after dinner drink with a cheese course or as part of a menu pairing. According to Kevin Garry, Gramercy Tavern's assistant beverage director, not all beers are meant to be aged. Brews that benefit from cellaring feature greater alcohol and hops, which act as natural preservatives, and bitterness to let it develop, much like tannins in a wine. The vintage beer menu is divided into North American and European sections, with offerings ranging from $10–$23; aged ciders and pommeau (a blend of Calvados and unfermented apple juice) are also available. Lonesome Dove Western Bistro The weekday happy hour (4–7 PM) at this Texas import features a free daily \"snack\" with the order of a drink; the gratis grub includes garlic sweet fries (Wednesday) and lamb skewers (Friday). Park Avenue Cafe This tony Eastsider prematurely announced that it would close in the New Year – last month, it successfully renewed its lease at 100 E. 63rd Street, extending it for another 10 years. The restaurant plans to completely renovate its private events facilities in early 2007. Sumile The front-room bar at this French-influenced Village Japanese has been transformed into a sushi counter seating eight. To reflect the new menu additions, its name has been changed to Sumile Sushi. Alain Ducasse Better Burger (Second Ave. branch only) Emack & Bolio's (Seventh Ave. branch only) Inside La Gorge D'Or March Markt Minnow Googie's Gramercy 24 Sadie Mae's Cafe Sascha Zutto (Greenwich Ave. branch only)

Manhattan 212-673-6333 Coming Soon Ecco-la A mid-December reopening of this Upper East Side Italian standby (1660 Third Ave.), which shuttered some 18 months ago, is planned. El Quinto Pino This smaller spin-off of tiny Tía Pol will feature Spanish snacks like the ones served at Tia Pol's bar from 3 to 5 PM (think marinated olives, almonds, etc.), as well as some unique tapas dishes. Expect it to have a more casual bar atmosphere than its popular predecessor when it opens in the spring at 401 W. 24th Street. Kobe Club Pricey, pedigreed steaks are all the rage these days, so it's no wonder restaurateur Jeffrey Chodorow is putting his stamp on the genre with this Midtown steakhouse (65 W. 58th St.; 212-644-5623) debuting the first week of December. Two thousand samurai swords will suspend from the ceiling of the dining room, which will serve designer chops hailing from America, Australia and Japan, available in \"flights\" or to be mixed and matched as part of surf 'n' turf combinations. Josh DeChellis will not be in charge of the kitchen, as previously reported. Morandi Jody Williams (formerly of Gusto) will helm this forthcoming Italian bistro from Keith McNally, opening in mid-January at 211 Waverly Place. Tailor Sam Mason – the young, tattooed pastry chef who honed his skills working with Wylie Dufresne at wd-50 – will open this bi-level SoHo restaurant (525 Broome St.) showcasing sweet and salty creations rooted in the avant-garde techniques of molecular gastronomy (think crème brûlée \"pebbles\") in early 2007. A first-floor lounge will serve cocktails crafted by mixologist Eben Freeman, who also shook things up at wd-50. X20 Xaviar's on the Hudson: A Yonkers outpost of Xaviar's at Piermont – Peter Kelly's top-rated Westchester New American – will open in April 2007; it will occupy the second floor of the Yonkers Recreation Pier (71 Water Grant St.) and offer sweeping views of the Palisades. Also Coming Soon By the Way, Whatever Happened To... Restaurants originally reported in the ZagatWire as opening in 2006 and now postponed till 2007 include: Allen & Delancey (115 Allen St.), Artemis (1260 Broadway), Blue Ribbon Sushi Bar & Grill (6 Columbus Circle), Cafe Largo (3387 Broadway), Centro Vinoteca (74 Seventh Ave. S.), Harry Cipriani (781 Fifth Ave.), La Moelle (225 Varick St.), Landmarc at the Time Warner Center (10 Columbus Circle), Nizza (630 Ninth Ave.), Park Chinois (2 Lexington Ave.) and P*ONG (150 W. 10th St.). Good Deals and Other News Ama This slick SoHo Southern Italian offers free antipasto at its bar weekdays from 5:30–8 PM; $10 cocktails like the Bicicletta (sparkling white wine and Campari) complement the nibbles. Bemelmans Bar The hotel's fanciful \"Madeline High Tea\" (Friday–Sunday from noon–4 PM; $35 per person) is hosting a \"Toys for Tots Drive\" throughout December, when children and their parents are invited to donate dolls, coloring books and other items. Burgers & Cupcakes A Chelsea outpost (265 W. 23rd St.) of this meats-and-sweets Garment District venue is poised to open on December 19th. After the new branch opens, the original will change its name and format. Café Gray Diners can tuck into a hearty new seasonal menu featuring dishes such as porcini and chestnut soup ($16) and rabbit and foie gras stew ($39). China Grill Management Through Christmas, Asia de Cuba, Ono and other China Grill Management restaurants are donating 25 percent of all dessert sales to City Harvest, the nonprofit food rescue organization. Chinatown Brasserie Over Christmas weekend (December 22–25), this stylish NoHo newcomer is trading its Peking ducks for Peking turkeys; the $48 bird feeds two, and comes with steamed Mandarin pancakes, cranberry-ginger chutney, hoisin sauce, scallions, cucumbers and fresh coriander. Available to eat in only. Max Brenner This wildly popular chocolatier chain and cocoa-themed bistro has opened a new East Village location (141 Second Ave.; 212-388-0030). Parea Kava, Parea's new downstairs lounge, serves wine, ouzo and specialty cocktails, plus $29 flight pairings – including mezedes matched with cocktails and desserts with sparkling wines. It's open seven days a week from 5:30 PM–4 AM. Rao's Sure, you have to be seriously connected to nab a table at NYC's famously insular Italian – but now your consolation prize needn't be just a jar of its red sauce. A new 10,000-sq.-ft. outpost is opening December 6th in Las Vegas' Caesars Palace, boasting two replicas of the original East Harlem dining room, not to mention an outdoor bocce ball court and – mamma mia! – a reservation line: 702-731-RAOS. Chelsea Bistro Ida Mae Joe's Ginger (Mott St. branch only)

Bar Boulud Daniel Boulud's Upper West Side wine bar (1900 Broadway) now has a name, and its simplicity belies its serious food-and-wine program (even if it is casual by Boulud standards). The cellar will boast some 500 wines, and \"reverse pairings\" will match the Burgundy-heavy list with a New French menu showcasing homemade artisanal charcuterie. Look for a September 2007 debut. BLT Market Laurent Tourondel's latest NYC location is still on track for a spring opening, likely in May. Housed in the former Atelier space in the Ritz-Carlton Central Park (50 Central Park S.), it will offer a rotating seasonal menu that could change as often as once a month. The breezy, elegant setting will feature paintings of figs, heirloom tomatoes, pomegranates and other market bounty, large windows that open onto the street in classic bistro style, outdoor seating and a separate exterior entrance on Sixth Avenue. Insieme In other naming news, Hearth chef Marco Canora has settled on a sobriquet – it means \"together\" in Italian – for his forthcoming project in The Michelangelo hotel (152 W. 51st St.). It's a nod to the old-world-meets-new-world menu, in which fairly straightforward preparations will sit side by side with more experimental dishes merging Italian cooking techniques with seasonal, less traditional ingredients. The opening is now scheduled for April. Mercat Like Boqueria and Casa Mono, this newcomer will marry Catalan cooking and a hip setting, to include an open kitchen and a downstairs tapas lounge; it's set to debut in Noho (45 Bond St.) in mid-March. Southern Hospitality Justin Timberlake is reportedly opening this BBQ restaurant on the Upper East Side. Also Coming Soon B.R. Guest Restaurants confirms it has taken over the former Park Avenue Country Club space (381 Park Avenue S.) a few doors up from Dos Caminos, where it plans to install a steakhouse in fall 2007. The deal to open Park Chinois with London restaurateur Alan Yau having fallen through, Ian Schrager is now negotiating with chef Yuji Wakiya of Tokyo's Wakiya Ichiemicharo to partner on an upscale Chinese restaurant in his Gramercy Hotel (2 Lexington Ave.) Good Deals and Other News Boathouse The outdoor patio of this Central Park oasis is reopening for the warm-weather season on April 15th; new additions include an outdoor grill and live music in the evenings. Bouley In the fall, David Bouley will move his flagship restaurant across the street to 161 Duane Street. At that time, the 120 W. Broadway space will become Bouley Bakery and, over at the current Bouley Bakery & Market space at 130 W. Broadway, his Upstairs eatery will expand to include the ground floor. Cité & Cité Grill Both of these Midtown eateries will permanently close on April 2nd. 15 East Marco Moreira's Japanese restaurant in the old Tocqueville space debuted in December with just a sushi bar; now, a cooked menu is also available, including the likes of prawn tempura ($18), wild salmon three ways ($26) and sirloin of Colorado Kobe beef ($45). Gramercy Tavern Chef Mike Anthony's new menu includes signature dishes such as suckling pig and flat-iron steak with short-rib ravioli ($76 for three courses). Kobe Club In protest of his recent zero-star New York Times review, restaurateur Jeffrey Chodorow took out a full-page Times ad on February 21st lambasting critic Frank Bruni; Chodorow has since launched a blog to swipe back at Gotham restaurant critics. London Bar A prix fixe menu is now available at Gordon Ramsay's small-plates eatery; the two- and three-course menus ($25 and $31, respectively) include choices such as chicken liver and foie gras parfait and risotto of sweet corn and basil, served from 11 AM–6:30 PM daily. Miriam A new Cobble Hill branch of this Park Slope Israeli-Med has opened at 229 Court Street, where it boasts a full liquor license and bar, as well as weekday breakfast and weekend brunch hours. Patina Restaurant Group Through March 11th, purchase any bottle of red wine and receive 25 percent off and a \"Pocket Guide to Wine\" from Wine Enthusiast Magazine; the \"Savor the Reds\" offer is available at all Patina Restaurant Group restaurants, including Brasserie 8 1/2 and Sea Grill. Russian Tea Room Star chef Gary Robins is no longer in the kitchen of this Russian revivalist, which recently began serving weekday breakfast and lunch, as well as weekend brunch. Shorty's The Philly cheese steak specialist formerly known as Tony Luke's now goes by this new name. Smith & Wollensky Smith & Wollensky Group Inc. will merge with Patina Restaurant Group (Patina, Sea Grill, etc.) as part of a $79.5 million deal that will leave the steakhouse chain's six NYC restaurants – including Park Avenue Cafe and Quality Meats – in the hands of founder Alan Stillman. Patina says it will expand the Smith & Wollensky brand outside of NYC. Earlier this year, the Texas-based Landry's Restaurants Inc. (owner of the Chart House and Rainforest Cafe chains, among others) had launched a hostile takeover bid of the steakhouse chain. Strip House Speaking of steakhouses – on Sundays, this voluptuous West Villager takes 20 percent off roughly a dozen bottles on its wine list.

Toloache photo: Ryan Charles Los Dados, a new Mexican restaurant from Lotus partners David Rabin and Will Regan, opens today in the former Meatpacking District home of Meet. Rabin describes it as \"casual, authentic, accessible\"; co-owner Sue Torres (Sueños) will oversee the kitchen (71-73 Gansevoort St.; 646-810-7290). Meanwhile, Hell’s Kitchen’s gentrification continues with the arrival of Toloache, a spiffy Nuevo Mexicano offering contemporary takes on traditional fare paired with a wide tequila selection; centered around a ceviche/guacamole bar, the split-level setup is decorated with a light touch that conveys a south-of-the-border mood without resorting to kitsch (251 W. 50th St.; 212-581-1818).

By Deirdre Donovan, ZAGAT.com staff editor The restaurant industry reinvents itself with an eco-conscious eye London's Acorn House Photo: Cindy Chen The greening of the restaurant industry, an idealistic movement that took root decades ago, is now a global phenomenon encompassing both community-based eateries and splashy hot spots. And diners seem primed to appreciate environmentally sensitive cuisine – according to our 2007 America's Top Restaurants guide, 65% of surveyors said they would pay more for food that has been sustainably raised or procured. But exactly what makes a restaurant green is open to interpretation. For some, it means menus emphasizing concepts like \"local,\" \"sustainable\" and \"organic.\" For others, it means harnessing alternative energy sources (bicycle-powered blender, anyone?) or banning bottled water. Below are some ways in which restaurants are going green, followed by a list of resources for the conscientious epicure. Know Your Sources One of the most common ways restaurants embrace the green movement is by cultivating relationships with area farmers, a simple idea with far-reaching impact pioneered by Alice Waters at Chez Panisse in Berkeley, which opened in 1971. Today the restaurant works with 60-plus farms, and Waters continues to lead from the front with the Chez Panisse Foundation, which promotes food awareness in public schools. No longer limited to bohemian Berkeley, responsible food sourcing is now practiced at big-ticket eateries coast-to-coast. In LA, Grace’s Neal Fraser sources 90% of his ingredients from local ranchers who provide their animals with healthy diets and local farmers who reject pesticides. In the Chicago area, Vie's Paul Virant exclusively uses meat and dairy products raised humanely with 100% vegetarian feed and no hormones or chemicals. Celebrity chef Laurent Tourondel’s new BLT Market in NYC’s Ritz-Carlton Central Park features a monthly changing menu focused on first-of-the-season produce and wild and unusual items grown locally. Some toques are following Waters' lead by promoting social change outside of the kitchen: Ted Walter (Passionfish in Pacific Grove, CA) advocates for sustainable seafood awareness, while Peter Hoffman (NYC's Savoy) works closely with both Chefs Collaborative, a national network of sustainably minded food professionals, and NYC’s Greenmarket. Become a Farmer Some restaurants take the farm-to-table movement a step further and grow their own food. When Dan Barber opened NYC’s Blue Hill in 2000, he supplied part of the restaurant’s produce from his Berkshires family farm. Four years later he expanded that vision by opening Blue Hill at Stone Barns, a restaurant and educational center on a diversified organic farm 30 miles up the Hudson River where the entire menu comes from ingredients grown or raised on-site. Similarly, Farm 255 in Athens, GA, uses produce from its own seven-acre biodynamic farm as a way to “reconnect food to its roots and people to their food.” Real estate at a premium? No problem. Growing your own doesn’t require acres of land. Rick Bayless of Chicago’s Frontera Grill and Topolobampo grows chiles and tomatoes, mainstays of his menu, up on the restaurants' roof. Reduce Waste Restaurants are finding creative ways to make better use of their limited resources. Hugo Matheson and Kimbal Musk, owners of The Kitchen in Boulder, CO, are particularly innovative when it comes to reducing waste. For example, sacks from their coffee roaster are passed to a local farm where they’re used for vegetable storage over winter. Vegetables from the farm then go to the restaurant. The Kitchen claims to eliminate close to 100% of its refuse thanks to such methods, along with mindful food preparation and vigorous composting and recycling. Another fan of using more and disposing less is Chris Cosentino of San Francisco’s Incanto; he promotes nose-to-tail eating with an adventurous menu prepared in a kitchen that throws away no animal parts. Also in San Francisco, Jardinière recycles or composts almost 85% of its waste and plans to list composting locations on its Web site to help its neighbors do the same. Increase Energy Efficiency According to the Green Restaurant Association, restaurants use 33% of the electricity gobbled up by U.S. businesses each year. Alternative power can help offset this. Colorado wind farms provide electricity to the lean and clean Kitchen – the restaurant even donates all leftover cooking oils to a biodiesel-fuel-using neighbor. In New Brunswick, NJ, The Frog and the Peach recently mounted 58 solar panels on its roof that it hopes will generate 20–25% of its electricity and eliminate 24,000 pounds in carbon dioxide emissions yearly. Other energy innovators include Chicago’s Hannah's Bretzel, which makes its deliveries with a fuel-efficient, low-emission MINI Cooper; NYC's Del Posto, which recently announced it will join Chez Panisse and others in eliminating bottled water; and the Brooklyn outpost of Café Habana, which uses kinetic energy from a bicycle to power its blender. Use Eco-minded Products Restaurants can reduce their impact on the environment by avoiding the use of harmful chemicals and finding alternative sources for common materials. LA's Abode was built using wood planks reclaimed from a 200-year-old Temecula farm. London's Acorn House keeps spruce with eco-friendly cleaning products. And the tables at Chicago’s organic pizza lounge Crust are constructed from recycled tires.

The 18-year-old Italian eatery Paper Moon Milano closed last Friday night. It is scheduled to re-emerge as a Tuscan eatery named Visconti (after the great Italian director Luchino Visconti) on September 15th. Teddy Suric, former partner at davidburke & donatella, is co-owner with Giuseppe Viterale, ex GM of Cellini. Meanwhile, Paper Moon Express, the smaller branch of the restaurant at 54 E. 59th Street, is still open for business.

The contestants on Next Iron Chef from left: Michael Symon, Jill Davie, Morou Ouattara, John Besh, Gavin Kaysen, Aarón Sanchez , Chris Cosentino and Traci Des Jardins. photo: Food Network Starting to worry about what food reality show will be around when Top Chef Miami comes to its inevitable close? No worries, the granddaddy of cooking competitions, Iron Chef, is following the lead of its many progeny. This October, the Food Network's venerable cooking competition, based on the classic Japanese show, is going the way of Top Chef, Hell's Kitchen and the Food Network's own Next Food Network Star. Instead of the usual hour-long battle between a guest toque and an \"Iron\" chef, the special six-episode season of Next Iron Chef will weed through eight chef-contestants competing to earn the title of \"Iron Chef\" in that show's upcoming season. Unlike other reality cooking competitions, all the chefs on Next Iron Chef hail from established, Zagat-rated restaurants. Going for the Iron are: Besh Steak's John Besh, Josie executive chef Jill Davie, Incanto's Chris Cosentino, Jardinière's Traci Des Jardins (who won her battle on Iron Chef America), El Bizcocho's chef de cuisine Gavin Kaysen, Farrah Olivia's Morou Ouattara, Centrico's Aarón Sanchez, and Michael Symon, the executive chef and owner of Cleveland's Lola and Lolita. Next Iron Chef premieres on the Food Network October 7th at 9 PM and will wrap up just in time for the November 18th premiere of Iron Chef America.

Diners at Danny Meyer's The Modern are used to chef Gabriel Kreuther’s “phenomenal” prix fixe dinners and the hefty checks that come with them, but those are just the warm up. On Saturday and Sunday, September 29th and 30th, chef Kreuther will team up with a fellow Alsace native, chef Thierry Marx of Château Cordeillan-Bages in Bordeaux, to produce a 10-course dinner paired with specially selected wines from the private cellar of Château Lynch-Bages, many in rare, large-format bottles. Dinners for both evenings will be held in the main dining room overlooking MoMA's sculpture garden. On hand to speak to guests about the wines, which have been selected from vintages spanning the past forty years, will be Château Lynch-Bages owner Jean-Charles Cazes (September 29 and 30; tables can be booked throughout the evening; $675 per person all inclusive; 212-408-6654).

Restaurateur Steve Hanson is a busy guy. On September 21st, he's opening Primehouse New York (381 Park Avenue S.) a few doors away from his popular Dos Caminos. Now comes word that he's transforming the old Barça 18 space at 225 Park Avenue South into Wildwood Bar BQ. Scheduled to debut in late October/early November, it will offer classic American barbecue in digs designed by David Rockwell. In other words, don't expect your run-of-the-mill roadhouse: think a 100-ft.-long bar, a \"BBQ friendly wine list\" and decor that brings an \"urban perspective to the classic barbecue joint.\"

***CONTENT
Last week we took a look at the rising costs of prix fixe meals and found that in the course of just a few months they had risen at a healthy clip, anywhere from 2 to 20%. But that's not all, folks. According to our researchers, who are preparing for the upcoming 2008 New York City Restaurants book, more increases are on the way. On August 20th, the dinner menu at Gramercy Tavern will spring from $76 to $82 and the tasting menu from $98 to $110. Even oldie-but-goodie theater staple Chez Napoléon is in on the act: its dinner menu is now $30, up from $25. The one exception to the rule, for now, seems to be Lever House, which lowered its tasting menu from $140 to $95 earlier this year.

Got a street vendor that you just can’t quit? Tell us about your favorites on the Zagat Discussion boards! Whether they’re into hot dogs or halal, knishes or oysters (seriously), New Yorkers have had a long and often loving relationship with street food and the men and women who serve it. Sure, a few restaurants get in the game via roving carts – such as those operated by Daisy May's, Hallo Berlin and Otto – but most street eats are provided by hard-working, independent purveyors. And for the last three years, those purveyors have gotten a shot at the culinary limelight via the Vendy Awards. Created as a fund-raiser for the Street Vendor Project, the Vendy Awards culminate in an \"intense cook-off between the best sidewalks chefs in the city\" that takes place annually at the end of September. Each summer, anyone and everyone is invited to nominate their favorite vendor. The top five will then compete in an \"Iron Chef–style cook-off\" and awards ceremony in late September with music supplied by New York's street and subway musicians (September 29; 3–8 PM; $60 per person; location TBA).

Terra Verde at the Green Valley Ranch Resort Last night Fox wrapped up the third season of its hit kitchen reality show from chef Gordon Ramsay, Hell's Kitchen. This year the top prize went to Virginian Rock Harper, 30, who now will have \"the coveted title of Head Chef of a new fine Italian restaurant at the Green Valley Ranch Resort and Spa in Las Vegas.\" Specifically Rock, whose food has a generally Southern sensibility, will be the head chef at the new Henderson, NV Italian eatery Terra Verde. The new restaurant builds on the success of its sibling Terra Rossa (where Hell's Kitchen 2 winner Heather West runs the show), presenting itself as a slightly more casual spot in Green Valley Ranch. It likewise offers upscale Italian fare in a setting that feels miles away from the casino, with a quiet, neutral-toned dining area and a solarium-like room; lagniappes such as an antipasti plate and a basket with five kinds of bread encourage lingering while watching the action in the open kitchen – where Rock will soon be installed. 2300 Paseo Verde Pkwy., Henderson, NV; 702-617-7075

Forum photo: Ryan Charles Brought to you by a pair of former Union Square Cafe bartenders, 8th St. Winecellar offers a well-parsed selection of vinos along with the usual small plates; it’s the latest arrival on morphing Eighth Street, long known for its shoe stores but now gradually moving in an eating-and-drinking direction (28 W. Eighth St., downstairs; 212-260-9463). From the owners of nearby Revival comes Forum, a new bar/lounge off Union Square set in the former Pop space, an upscale affair thanks to the liberal use of stone and leather; it’s different from everything else nearby with a looong bar and cushy seating areas (127 Fourth Ave.; 212-505-0360). Like its sibling, Stout, the Village's new Half Pint is a beer specialist offering an encyclopedia selection of suds (23 choices on tap, 64 by the bottle); the ultraplain den is spread out over two quart-size rooms and is already an NYU magnet, no surprise given an address a block from Washington Square Park (76 W. Third St.; 212-260-1088). Eastern bloc beers and wine found nowhere else in town turn up at Klimat, a funky new barroom with a Polish accent offering free tastes before you commit; the decor’s strictly East Village – picnic table seating, homemade light fixtures – ditto the unpretentious mood (77 E. Seventh St.; 917-214-0589). Name checking its street number and basement location, 99 Below, a new Irish pub in the heart of MacDougal Street’s frat row, is a boxy, wood-lined number with the obligatory tap brews and greasy grub; pricing reflects NYU-size wallets.

Out with chandeliers, in with star chefs as hotel restaurants shed their stuffy image Dean Fearing “Formal dining is dead,” declares Dean Fearing, the chef who spent two decades at the Mansion on Turtle Creek in Dallas. “I think people want to be wowed, but I don’t think being wowed is formal dining any more,” he adds. Given that stance, it might seem surprising that Fearing has chosen to team up with Ritz-Carlton, the luxury hotel chain, for his next venture: Fearing’s Restaurant, which opens as part of the new Dallas Ritz-Carlton on August 15th. But Fearing says it won’t resemble the stereotypically stuffy hotel dining room of yore. Instead, it will feature Southwestern flavors, wild game and an atmosphere that will make guests feel comfortable in boots and jeans. “In Texas, people don’t want to dress up to go out,” observes Fearing. The Ritz-Fearing matchup is but one example of a burgeoning trend of high-profile chefs teaming up with high-end hoteliers. The main reason behind it is simple: hot restaurants create a buzz that brings in more business, explains Simon Cooper, president of Ritz-Carlton, which has nearly a dozen celeb chef restaurants open or underway at properties around the world. “It’s the difference between a restaurant as an amenity and as a destination,” says Cooper. “Too many of our guests were going out the front door and getting into taxis and limousines and going somewhere else to eat. They were looking for culinary and entertainment experiences elsewhere.” That’s partly, Cooper concedes, because of the staid, even oppressive atmosphere of many hotel dining rooms. Luxury hotel guests are now younger, more diverse in backgrounds and tastes and more open to new experiences, he observes. “There are people who love our chandeliers and our heavy drapes but, broadly speaking, we’re seeing customer tastes changing,” says Cooper. Booking a boldface-name chef is also one of the best ways for a hotel to stand out from competitors notes Lyle Stern, a Miami-based leasing agent who signed Mr. Chow to the W in South Beach, set to open in 2009, and Daniel Boulud to Miami’s Met Marquis (a Marriott hotel), which will feature an offshoot of Boulud’s NYC-based db Bistro Moderne when it opens in 2009. “Daniel Boulud putting his name on the front door screams volumes about the kind of hotel they are and the kind of customer they want to attract,” Stern says. Similar thinking is going on at The Regent Boston at Battery Wharf, a hotel and condo project being built on the Boston Harbor. When it opens next year, it will be one of several luxury hotels in the city. But it will be the only one that can boast a restaurant by acclaimed French chef Guy Martin, making his first foray to North America. The developers are hoping that Martin, who runs the kitchen at Le Grand Véfour in Paris, will add some glitz and help set their project apart from other high-end hostelries also under construction in Boston, such as the W and Mandarin Oriental. “We see it as an opportunity for our guests to say to their friends, ‘Come dine with me at the best restaurant in Boston,’” says Steve Hedberg, vice-president of Carlson, which owns the Regent brand. “It becomes a point to sell against our competition.” Marriages between celebrity chefs and hotels began in the mid-1990s says Bjorn Hanson, head of the hospitality consulting arm of PricewaterhouseCoopers. The boutique Kimpton Hotels group and Steve Wynn at the Bellagio in Las Vegas were among the first to see the potential of using restaurants to attract guests. When MGM bought the Bellagio, they spread that concept throughout their properties in Vegas – where, for example, the MGM Grand is now home to Joël Robuchon’s lavish eponymous restaurant and his more casual L’Atelier – and Atlantic City, where the Borgata boasts eateries such as Bobby Flay Steak and Michael Mina’s SeaBlue. And starting this fall they’ll do the same at the MGM Grand Detroit, which will feature offerings from Mina and Wolfgang Puck. The trend gained momentum with the growth of luxury hotels, the evolution of dining into a form of entertainment and – last but not least – the transformation of chefs into celebrities. Indeed, only in recent years have there been enough recognizable chefs to make the concept work, Hanson points out. From a chef’s perspective, working with the right hotel is key. Eric Ripert, executive chef and co-owner of Le Bernardin in New York, says he turned down many offers to open restaurants in hotels before agreeing to open Blue by Eric Ripert and the more casual Periwinkle, both at the Ritz-Carlton, Grand Cayman. Ripert will also be opening a bistro at the Washington, DC Ritz-Carlton later this year and in the Philadelphia Ritz next year. He chose Ritz-Carlton because he considers them “a very serious operator who understands about quality,” Ripert explains. “I’ll be spending most of my time here [in New York] with Le Bernardin, and I need someone who understands my standards. It allows me to stay at my flagship.” And odds are he’ll have no trouble scoring a great room to stay in when he visits those hotel ventures.

Kee's Chocolates photo: Emily Capo Where do you go for the best chocolate? ZAGAT.com voters have rated Kee's Chocolates as the top spot to get their cocoa on. Do you agree with the results? Tell us on the Zagat Discussion boards! There is little doubt that New Yorkers love their chocolates (almost as much as they love their cupcakes!) but which of the city's plethora of confectioners should you patronize? The 2008 New York City Gourmet Shopping & Entertaining Survey comes to the rescue with a list of the top five, starting with a surprise winner: 1. Kee's Chocolates 80 Thompson St.; 212-334-3284 “OMG!” rave reviewers of the “divine”, “creative” chocolates “made by hand on the premises” at this tiny, “hidden-away” SoHo shop – this year voted tops in NYC for Candy – that’s owned and run by “master of flavors” Kee Ling Tong, whose “exotic” fillings, many reflecting an Asian influence, are deemed “unforgettable”; “exquisite” product aside, the vibe is “unpretentious” and the staff “a pleasure to talk to”, so “treat yourself” – “it’s worth every penny”, but just “get there early” because they sometimes start “running out” of choices later in the day. La Maison Chocolat photo: Emily Capo 2. La Maison Chocolat 1018 Madison Ave.; 212-744-7117 30 Rockefeller Plz.; 212-265-9404 Just about “the best this side of Paris – or heaven” is the word on the “superb” truffles and other “fragrant, intense”, “subtly flavored” chocolates imported from France and offered in “jewel”-worthy displays and packaging at this “ultra-high-end” Madison Avenue boutique and its Rock Center offshoot; it’s the “Rolls-Royce” of bonbons – with “awe”-inspiring prices to match – though there are a few grumbles about service that, while “knowledgeable and efficient”, can be “frosty” at times; P.S. “try the hot chocolate!” (both stores have tearooms), and check out the tastings and classes. Martine's Chocolates photo: Emily Capo 3. Martine's Chocolates 1000 Third Ave., 6th fl.; 212-705-2347 400 E. 82nd St.; 212-744-6289 “Truly freshly made” chocolates – you can “actually see them” being prepared on premises – lure cacao-nnoisseurs to this “sweet asset” on the East Side, whose original Bloomie’s location makes the perfect “shoppers’ pit stop”; beyond its signature “amazing, rich” filled chocolates, there are novelty offerings “in every shape possible” (think “baseballs and Statues of Liberty”) – though naturally such “high quality” comes at a steep price. Pierre Marcolini photo: Emily Capo 4. Pierre Marcolini 485 Park Ave.; 212-755-5150 “Just when you thought NYC didn’t need another fancy chocolatier”, along came this East Side Belgian “class act” and its “phenomenal”, “mmm” chocolates in “gorgeous flavors” and connoisseur-conscious formulations (e.g. “fantastic single-origin” bonbons that “provide insight into chocolate terroir”); yes, they’re “beyond expensive”, but when looking to splurge or give a gift “perfect for any occasion”, most find it “well worth” the outlay to sample “Brussels’ best – on Park Avenue.” Jacques Torres photo: Emily Capo 5. Jacques Torres 66 Water St., Brooklyn; 718-875-9722 350 Hudson St.; 212-414-2462 Follow “pied piper of chocolate” Jacques Torres to one of his “chic”, “Willy Wonka”–worthy factories/shops – either the “quaint” Dumbo original or the “larger”, sleeker West SoHo offshoot – for trademark “ooh-la-la” hot chocolate and “ecstasy-inducing” confections “handmade on the spot”; the “extensive”, “delightfully” displayed selection includes treats ranging from “highbrow” “modern truffles” to “fun” chocolate-covered cornflakes and a parade of novelty shapes, ensuring “there’s always something new” to sample here.

Troubles Keep Following the Ciprianis

The uncertainties facing the Cipriani clan, who own such high-class eateries as the Rainbow Room, Harry’s Bar in Venice, Downtown Cipriani, Harry Cipriani and Cipriani Dolci, continue. Less than two weeks after Arrigo and Giuseppe Cipriani, the father-son team in charge of the restaurants, plead guilty of tax evasion, their party space in the Toy Building on Fifth Avenue has been threatened by landlords and now their liquor licenses, according to the New York Post, are possibly up for grabs as well: The State Liquor Authority's top lawyer said Friday the agency would move to yank the corporation's liquor licenses because state law forbids convicted felons - whether a person or a company - to sell booze. The best hope for the Ciprianis to keep their licenses would be either a pardon from New York Governor Spitzer or special permission from the sentencing judge or a parole board – not an unreasonable possibility. But it remains to be seen if the white-collar businesses and government officials who make up a good part of the Ciprianis' clientele will be as inclined to patronize their establishments in the wake of their legal troubles.

The decor at Dillons, post Ramsay visit. photo: Liz Borod Wright The legal difficulties surrounding Gordon Ramsay's Fox reality TV series Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares, in which the chef plays savior to failing restaurants, seem to be coming to a close. Earlier this summer Ramsay's troubles began when Martin Hyde, a former manager at Dillons (now Purnima) filed suit against the show claiming that it was a \"prime example of fake TV\" and that Ramsay and his crew had misrepresented both the state of the restaurant and the success of Ramsay's make-over. Yesterday a Manhattan Federal Judge tossed the case into arbitration, as required by their contract. This move allows Ramsay to proceed with his television show, and puts a shadow over Hyde's case as the contract for Nightmares includes the caveat that the \"appearance, depiction, and/or portrayal of you and in connection with the Series and your actions and of others displayed in and in connection with the Series, may be disparaging, defamatory, embarrassing or of an otherwise unfavorable nature, may expose you to public ridicule, humiliation or condemnation, and may portray you in a false light.\"

***CONTENT
Changing restaurant prices is a common gripe among foodies, one brought to light again earlier this week by Frank Bruni. It should come as no surprise that successful restaurants like to raise their prices. That is, until you see just how much those prices can increase. In preparing for the upcoming 2008 New York City Restaurants book, our researchers have been monitoring the changes in prix fixe meals in establishments throughout the city. Between May and August alone, these are some of the prix fixe changes that we’ve found: Churrascaria Plataforma Lunch all-you-can-eat prix fixe rose from $30.95 to $32.95, dinner rose from $51.95 to $54.95 (6% increase for both). <a href=\"/verticals/PropertyDetails.aspx?VID=8&R=51118>Gramercy Tavern Dinner rose from $76 to $82(8%) and the tasting menu rose from $98 to $110 (12%). Korea Palace Lunch rose from $16.95 to $17.95 (6%) and dinner rose from $39 to $44.95 (15%). La Grenouille Lunch rose from $59 to $60 (2%), the tasting menu went from $125 to $130 (4%) but dinner remained the same. Le Bernardin Lunch rose from $59 to $64 (8%), dinner and tasting menus remained the same. Levana Lunch and dinner both rose from $32.50 to $35 (8%). Todai Lunch rose from $13.95 to $15.95 (14%), dinner rose from $23.95 to $25.95 (8%). The View Brunch rose from $54.95 to $69.95 (27%), the tasting menu rose from $75 to $90 (20%) but the dinner prix fixe did not change. And did any prix fixes go down in the past few months? Yes. One. Lever House, whose tasting menu last year was $115. In May it had increased to $140 and now is down to just $95. Similarly, with paired wines, their price in May was $190, and now is $145. That is a 32% drop (a 28% drop with wine), though only 17% compared to a year ago.

How do you conserve food miles? Let us know on the Zagat Discussion boards! “Food miles” (the distance that your food has traveled before consumption) has become a hot topic as the threat of global warming has loomed larger. But is this the right thing to focus on? New research in now emerging arguing that while food miles can be worth noting, they miss the whole story. An op-ed in the New York Times by James E. McWilliams brings this to light thanks to a study from Lincoln University in New Zealand: Instead of just counting the miles from production to your plate, the researchers counted everything they could put a number to, and got some surprising results: Most notably, they found that lamb raised on New Zealand’s clover-choked pastures and shipped 11,000 miles by boat to Britain produced 1,520 pounds of carbon dioxide emissions per ton while British lamb produced 6,280 pounds of carbon dioxide per ton, in part because poorer British pastures force farmers to use feed. In other words, it is four times more energy-efficient for Londoners to buy lamb imported from the other side of the world than to buy it from a producer in their backyard. Similar figures were found for dairy products and fruit. So maybe the key isn’t necessarily only eating locally, but eating carefully and asking the right questions about how the food was produced. Nobody ever said eating environmentally would be easy!

Fast Food Slow To Drop Trans Fat?

***CONTENT
A little over a month since New York City's trans fat ban went into effect restaurants have been quickly figuring out how to deal with the new requirements, some better then others. Specifically, it seems that some fast food restaurants are having trouble getting their food into shape. To prove this, a new study from the Center for Science in the Public Interest released yesterday found that Burger King and Wendy's are still serving french fries chock full of trans fat: In mid-July, CSPI purchased large orders of fries from five different McDonald’s, Burger King, and Wendy’s outlets in Manhattan and had an independent laboratory analyze them. McDonald’s had the least trans fat (0.2 grams per serving). Wendy’s had 3.7 grams per serving, and Burger King had 3.3 grams per serving (though Wendy’s serving size was 25-percent larger than Burger King’s). While shady, those numbers are still actually legal. According to the law, restaurants are required to use oil containing less than .5 grams of trans fats but are free to sell food with much more. That loophole closes July 1st, 2008, when restaurants must begin to guarantee food with less than .5 grams of trans fat per serving. To learn more about trans fats and the city's new guidelines, visit www.notransfatnyc.org.

The restaurant, which Zagat surveyors praise for its \"upscale\" food and staff “without the attitude found elsewhere,” is aiming to open on August 27th (427 Amsterdam Ave.; 212-580-0007). Also expanding its reach is the decidedly funky New American–Thai diner Vnyl (think bathrooms designed as shrines to the likes of Elvis and Dolly Parton). The quickly expanding chain is set to open its fourth location in the city, filling in for Chelsea's now shuttered Diner 24, in September (102 Eighth Avenue).

Alex Ureña is closing his eponymous restaurant after service on Saturday, August 18th, and will reopen it as Pamplona, a bistro specializing in Basque cooking, the day after Labor Day. It will feature lower price points and a spiffed-up setting, which was always a sticking point with surveyors despite Ureña's 25 Food score (37 E. 28th St.; 212-213-2328). It looks like Gray Kunz's long-awaited small-plates spot, Grayz, will finally see the light of day. Originally scheduled to open in fall of 2006, it's now set to debut the second week of September in the old Aquavit space, which is being restored to resemble its glamorous heyday as a Rockefeller residence. The swell surrounds will feature a private catering space for weddings and other functions (13-15 W. 54th St.; 212-262-4600). John Schaefer, who ran the kitchen at Gramercy Tavern after Tom Colicchio departed last year, will helm Irving Mill, the seasonal New American opening at 116 E. 16th Street in mid-September. Speaking of market-driven cuisine, BLT Market, Laurent Tourondel's latest NYC outpost, is now on track for a September debut inside the Ritz-Carlton Central Park (50 Central Park S.). Also opening next month is Primehouse New York, the steakhouse from B.R. Guest Restaurants that's setting up shop a few doors away from Dos Caminos. Its steaks will be aged on premises in a salt-tiled room (381 Park Avenue S.).

Have you got a good one to tell about drunk fine-dining? Share your stories on the Zagat Discussion boards! Drinking and dining have gone together forever – it's no secret that a great wine can save some of the most egregious meals – so it's little surprise that even diners at high-class establishments occasionally get more than a little tipsy during dinner. That doesn't mean it isn't surprising when you hear about a patron at, say, Per Se revisiting their dinner without even making it out of their chair. But these things do happen, and the New York Times' Frank Bruni has collected a few choice stories ranging from the classic bathroom tryst to the spontaneous middle-aged strip tease. One good example of what can happen when booze meets ritz is this well-worn tale from the Four Seasons: At the end of a long lunch three well-dressed, then undressed, women in their mid-20s decided that the marble pool in the center of the main dining room looked like a nifty spot for a dip, said Julian Niccolini, one of the restaurant’s owners. So they took one, wearing nothing more than their panties, he said. Asked about their motivation, Mr. Niccolini answered: “I’m not going to say the word drunk. They were very happy. They were very excited.” As well they should have been. A wealthy gentleman nearby had been buying them their drinks, which included bottles of Montrachet, Cristal and Cheval Blanc. The total bill came to more than $7,000, Mr. Niccolini said. While we haven't been privy to anything quite so exciting, we're sure you have. What kind of inappropriate antics have you witnessed in fancy restaurants?

Sugar Sweet Sunshine photo: Emily Capo Where do you go for the best cupcakes in the city? ZAGAT.com voters have rated Sugar Sweet Sunshine as the top spot to get their cupcake fix. Do you agree with the results? Tell us on the Zagat Discussion boards! Hot off the presses, the 2008 New York City Gourmet Shopping & Entertaining Survey answers perennial questions like “where can I find the best cupcakes in New York?” (If you guessed a certain little bakery on Bleecker Street, you need to keep reading.) So without further ado, the top five cupcake purveyors in town: 1. Sugar Sweet Sunshine 126 Rivington St.; 212-995-1960 Specializing in “superior cupcakes” rated tops in the genre – no mean feat in “cupcake-crazed” NYC – this “cute” Lower East Side bakery/cafe “warms you” with a “comfy” “place to sit” while sampling its trademark “little pieces of heaven” and “numerous other” “addictive” desserts like “moist cakes”, cookies and bars; with a “laid-back” vibe that’s as “unpretentious” as the goods are “completely fresh”, it definitely hits the “sweet spot.” 2. Amy’s Bread 672 Ninth Ave.; 212-977-2670 75 Ninth Ave.; 212-462-4338 250 Bleecker St.; 212-675-7802 Carbophiles “sing the praises” of the “heavenly” “artisan” goods at Amy Scherber’s bakery trio, now considered a NYC “classic”; reknowned for its “fantastic” handmade breads (including signatures like the semolina-raisin-fennel), it also traffics in sweets from “out-of-this-world” sticky buns to “awesome cupcakes”, as well as “delicious sandwiches” and other “good lunchables” – perfect for “eating at one of the few tables” if you can snag one. 3. Baked BKLYN* 359 Van Brunt St.; 718-222-0345 “Delicious” “twists on old American favorites” produced by this Red Hook “hipster” bakery – “homey, delicate”, “amazing” cakes and cupcakes, muffins, scones, the “best” brownies – lead many to moon “wish it were in Manhattan”; its “funky” modern digs make a “nice place to sit with your coffee and something sweet” (and there are also panini and a few other prepared items at lunchtime) – meaning it’s perfect for “fortifying yourself” pre-“Fairway.” 3. Billy’s Bakery* 184 Ninth Ave.; 212-647-9956 “Bless Billy!” enthuse admirers of this Chelsea bakery known for its “moist, buttery” cupcakes topped with “to-die for” icing, as well as for “tasty” full-size cakes, pies and other “homespun” “American-style” sweets, all “beautifully displayed” in “hip” “retro”-’40s digs; the “friendly” counter folk only “add to the sugar high”, and while “lines out the door” are not uncommon, at least they’re “not as long” as at that higher-profile cupcakery to the south. 3. Make My Cake* 121 St. Nicholas Ave.; 212-932-0833 2380 Adam Clayton Powell Blvd.; 212-234-2344 “Just like grandma’s” is the word on the Southern specialties from these Harlem bakeries, home to the “out-of-this-world” likes of red velvet cake, sweet potato cheesecake, “light, fluffy cupcakes” and a butter-cream number that’ll “melt in your mouth”; whether for birthdays, weddings or catering, a visit is sure to make your day; N.B. the St. Nicholas Avenue original is a sit-down cafe while the adjunct farther Uptown is retail only. *– indicates a tie for 3rd place.

Arrigo and Giuseppe Cipriani, the father-son team that runs such ritzy restaurants as the Rainbow Room, Harry’s Bar in Venice, Downtown Cipriani, Harry Cipriani and Cipriani Dolci pleaded guilty earlier today to evading $10 million in New York state and city taxes. Giuseppe Cipriani, president and CEO of Cipriani USA, pleaded guilty to misdemeanor tax evasion charges for falsifying tax returns. His father Arrigo, who owns Cipriani SA, pleaded guilty to felony tax charges. The pair are unlikely to serve any jail time, but will have to pay an estimated $10 million in back taxes as well as have an independent tax monitor for the next four years. The Ciprianis' lawyer Stanley Arkin did not immediately return our call, but told the AP that the plea \"allows the Cipriani family to put this incident behind them.”

July was a sad month for soul food in the city with two venerable restaurants shutting their doors for the last time. First to go was 9th Avenue mainstay Jezebel where owner Alberta Wright had been serving to theater crowds for over 24 years. Wright continues to dole out fried chicken at Piece of Chicken, a take-out window around the corner on West 45th Street (212-582-5973). And then on Sunday Harlem said goodbye to 145th Street soul-food institution Copeland’s. The restaurant, owned by Calvin Copeland, had been in operation for fifty years.

After two years of demonstrations and inflatable cockroaches outside of his French restaurant Daniel, owner Daniel Boulud has settled a federal lawsuit accusing his restaurant of discriminating against nonwhite employees. As part of the settlement, which is to be announced later today by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, Boulud has agreed to set up standards and procedures for hiring and promotion, implement sensitivity training for managers and dole out an 8 percent raise for busboys and runners. Interestingly, workers in the case were assisted in organizing by the Restaurant Opportunities Center of New York (ROC), which has recently been under scrutiny itself. Formed in 2002 to help former Windows on the World employees open their own restaurant, Colors, those employees now claim that ROC and a group of Italian investors tricked workers out of their investment.

Out of the Kitchen, Onto the Movie Set

By Jacqueline Wasilczyk Former 'Top Chef' contestant Lee Anne Wong chats with Zagat Buzz about cooking with 'No Reservations' No Reservations courtesy of Warner Bros. Top chefs are making their move to the big screen, and while they've yet to land leading roles, they're teaching the stars the skills they need to pass for natural born chefs. Ratatouille was rich in culinary detail thanks to Thomas Keller (The French Laundry, Per Se), who shared his expertise with the movie's animators and helped make it a hit with foodies. Likewise the credits for No Reservations – the romantic comedy that opens Friday and stars Catherine Zeta-Jones as Kate, a perfectionist chef suddenly facing challenges at home and in the kitchen – will include Michael White, former executive chef at Fiamma Osteria, and Top Chef fan favorite Lee Anne Wong. We spoke to Wong, who currently acts as Top Chef’s supervising culinary producer, about her role as culinary consultant on No Reservations and asked her what she thinks of our culture’s apparent obsession with all things chef- and cooking-related. Zagat Buzz: Tell us about your role as a culinary consultant on No Reservations. Lee Anne Wong photo: Giovanni Rufino, Bravo Lee Anne Wong: I worked with the production team and the director, Scott Hicks, to make sure the original screenplay made sense for American audiences. So things like [Kate’s] signature dish of “Quail with Truffles,” originally called “Pigeon with Truffles,\" had to be changed. I also worked with Jenny Wade, who plays Leah, the pregnant sous-chef. I taught her knife skills by asking her what she wanted to learn how to make, and then trained her [in] classic French technique. About halfway through our sessions I made her put on the fake belly because she had to learn how to be eight inches away from the stove while pregnant. I also had a couple of training sessions with Abigail Breslin. I taught her how to make pancakes and peel vegetables. ZB: What are the special demands of creating meals for a film? LAW: I worked with Scott Hicks and came up with a menu that would make sense for the restaurant that Kate owns, and then I worked with Diana Burton, who is the prop master, to actually style these dishes. We had a food stylist, so we took the menu items and had several sessions where we plated them differently. I would come in and plate a dish three or four different ways, and then Scott Hicks would come over with a production team and they picked out what they liked. It’s one thing to get a beautiful plate set down in front of you, but learning how it looks for the camera is something completely different, so it was a really interesting experience. ZB: Do you feel that No Reservations does justice to the real workings of restaurant kitchens? LAW: The production company of No Reservations worked with B.R. Guest Management and mirrored the kitchen closely to Fiamma. Michael White [former executive chef at Fiamma] did some hands-on training with both Catherine [Zeta-Jones] and Aaron [Eckhart], and one of the line cooks in the movie is actually one of the sous-chefs over at Dos Caminos. Two other line cooks, Arden Lewis and A.J. McCloud, are actually graduates of the French Culinary program. So these are actual line cooks who know the behavior of a kitchen, and that brings a sense of realism to the entire movie. ZB: When you decided to pursue a culinary career, would you have imagined a day when we’d see shows like Top Chef on TV and chef-centered movies like Ratatouille and No Reservations on the screen? LAW: My belief right now is that food is “in.” All things culinary are in a renaissance, and there are so many factors that have everything to do with it. People want to know where their food comes from, what goes on behind the scenes. Food is something that people delight in. They eat three meals a day and they want to know “the how and the why” behind what comes out to them on the table. ZB: Both No Reservations and Ratatouille feature tough female chefs who’ve struggled to get where they are and fight to guard their territory. Do women still have to fight harder than men to move up in the kitchen? LAW: I would say yes. I work in a culinary school, and even though half of our applicants are female, it’s still a male-dominated field. There are long hours, you’re working in front of a hot stove and there’s a lot of pressure to get things out on time. When I was a line cook there was always a lot of cursing, a lot of joking and male camaraderie, so you have to be tough. ZB: Top Chef has not yet had a female winner. Do you think it could happen this year? LAW: I think so. There’s a tremendous pool of talent for Season Three and we’ve had some really strong female characters. This season we looked for executive chefs, executive sous-chefs and people who ran their own businesses, so the cast this year has a lot of experience and creativity under their belt. There’s a distinct possibility for a female Top Chef. ZB: Since you pick the ingredients that the contestants choose from, watching the show have you been disappointed by some of their choices? LAW: In the episode [a few] weeks ago they were all going for scallops, and now scallops [are] the new crack of Top Chef 3. It makes my job difficult because I want to make sure that I give contestants a wide variety of proteins so that they’ll have choices. I’m thinking like a chef, so when I fill the fridge full of scallops, sea bass, this that and the other, and they all go for the same two ingredients, I could kick myself. ZB: Do you plan to continue your involvement with the show next season? What’s next for you? LAW: We’ll see if they ask me back! It’s a great job, and the fact that they are in Chicago next season makes me want to be involved. In addition to that I’ve also been talking to a couple of different networks regarding hosting my own cooking show. So hopefully I’ll continue to do production work with Bravo and still hold down my full-time job at the French Culinary Institute in New York City.

The blockbuster opening of the season has to be Wakiya, the upscale Chinese restaurant from the Nobu team debuting today in Ian Schrager's Gramercy Park Hotel (2 Lexington Ave.; 212-995-1330). Delivering Chinese food the likes of which Americans have never seen, chef Yuji Wakiya of Tokyo's Wakiya Ichiemicharo will apply Japanese technique to the traditional dishes of Shanghai, Szechuan, Canton and Beijing. Whether or not it heralds the second coming of Chinese cooking in this country remains to be seen, but for now, foodies are clamoring for a taste. The debut also marks an end to Schrager's protracted battle to get a restaurant up and running in the space. The hotelier had originally planned to open Park Chinois with London restaurateur Alan Yau (Hakkasan, Yauatcha), but that deal fell through after Yau ran into trouble procuring visas for his Chinese chefs.

Chicago-based mixologist Bridget Albert won the festival's Bar Chef competition. photo: Carla Spartos The fifth annual Tales of the Cocktail wrapped up in New Orleans yesterday. For those who couldn't make it to the five-day gathering of cocktail enthusiasts, here's a rundown of the highlights. The divide between bar and kitchen is diminishing. One farm-to-table tipple coming right up. Did you hear? Seasonal, healthy and/or organic cocktails are hot. \"I never thought I'd see Americans drink green tea,\" mused Bret Thorn of Nation's Restaurant News, \"but if you say it's good for them, they'll drink it.\" There's a current preoccupation with pairing food and hard booze. Smaller pours help keep diners upright and coherent. Look for more herbs and spices in your highball. \"I think the savory category is just dope,\" enthused Ryan Magarian, cocktail consultant for restaurants like Katsuya. Is Thai basil the Next Big Thing? After taking a 95-year hiatus in America, absinthe is back. Surprise, surprise. Specialty cocktail programs are cash cows for restaurants. Fun factoid: The second most popular drink order among men at the Olive Garden is the frozen tiramisu milkshake (Bud Light is number one), according to Bret Thorn. As you might imagine, a lot of drinking goes on at a cocktail convention. \"A tincture of Advil, please,\" quipped one slightly peaked presenter. Dale DeGroff on hangovers: \"There are two ways to cure a hangover. One is, don't start drinking. Number two is, don't stop drinking.\" – Carla Spartos

By Jacqueline Wasilczyk Hung Huynh swears he's a humble guy. Humble Hung? photo: Virginia Sherwood, Bravo Just as properly beaten egg whites are critical to the success of a soufflé, a “cheftestant” who can be counted on to inject a little drama into the proceedings is a key ingredient behind the success of Bravo’s Top Chef reality cooking series. Contender for this season’s Most Likely To Stir Things Up title is Hung Huynh, a 29-year-old sous-chef at Guy Savoy in Las Vegas. We asked Hung to tell us more about the show and why he deserves to be thought of as more than just this season’s troublemaker. Zagat Buzz: Have you learned anything on Top Chef that has helped you in the kitchen? Hung Huynh: I’m definitely more humble [laughs]. I’m a humble person in real life, actually. But when you are in a situation where you are competing and people are stabbing you in the back, or trying to, it’s a little different. I learned how to take criticism better. Even though some of the judges might be wrong, it’s their opinion, so I still respect that. ZB: Does your Top Chef personality mirror your personality outside the show at all? HH: I am very outspoken in real life. I say what I mean because that’s who I am and that’s how I developed as a chef. The chefs I’ve worked with, Thomas Keller, Guy Savoy and Christian Delouvrier, are tough and if you screw up they are not going to pat you on the back and whisper in your ear – they are going to chew your ass up. ZB: As the season progresses do you think you prove yourself to be the \"certified professional asshole\" you said you were in the first episode? HH: I think it looks that way. Since I was on the bottom a few times in the previous episodes, it seems the producers, the judges or me personally exposed my weakness of not accepting criticism too well. They figured out what pushed my buttons. In real life I take criticism very well; I’m a great team player. But on the show we are not in a real kitchen where you need teamwork to make a restaurant successful. ZB: Early on, Anthony Bourdain proclaimed you “the guy to beat” on his Bravo blog, calling you “one of the most talented, fearless and creative of the lot.” What quality do you think gives you the biggest edge over the other contestants? HH: I think I’m very quick in terms of my mind, technique and skills. Even though I do smoke, my palate is ridiculously good. It’s been proven. I can taste a lot of ingredients in a dish without being told what they are. I’ve also studied cookbooks and cooked since I was nine years old. This is my life, my second nature, so I suppose that’s what my advantage is. ZB: Who do you consider your greatest competition to be? HH: My greatest competitor would be Tre. He seemed to understand a lot of my techniques and the terminology that I might use. He really understands food better than some of the other chefs might. ZB: Can you explain some of the tense moments we’ve seen you have so far with other contestants? HH: Regarding the watermelon shooter [in episode two], I know I tasted Joey’s drink in the Quickfire, but when the BBQ challenge was announced I honestly forgot about his drink. It was just a coincidence, I think, because copying his watermelon drink would be like copying iced tea. About the crawfish [in episode three], we had 30 seconds to do it. And the rules were if you dropped anything you could not pick it up and use it. So if I went back to pick it up and put it back in the tank, people would wonder why I picked it up off the floor. It was a tense moment where I was kind of confused, and didn’t know what to do or not to do. ZB: Do you feel that how you act in Top Chef is indicative of how you behave in your kitchen? HH: Definitely not. I yell at my cooks when they run in the kitchen. Top Chef is very tense, so you’re not playing 100 percent there. You don’t sleep right, you don’t eat right, and it’s a really big kitchen, so you have to run around to grab things! ZB: And what about the arroz con pollo that almost got you sent home in episode four? Is there anything that you wish you could have changed? HH: I lived in Puerto Rico for three years and had a Puerto Rican girlfriend. That’s a dish I made for a lot of my staff and for my girlfriend, a dish I have eaten many, many times. I thought it was really, really good. Even Casey and other contestants said that they didn’t know why I was called up there. So that’s when I started thinking to myself, “Are they messing with me?” I was shocked. I used basmati rice instead of the traditional rice you should use so that it wouldn’t be mushy. ZB: What are your plans after the show concludes? HH: I don’t plan on staying in Las Vegas too long because competition isn’t great out there. I’m in New York right now, talking to some people about projects for next year. I like being in the city, this is where the competition is, where the real foodies are.

As anyone who's ordered a $15 pom-chai-lychee-tini at a splashy, big-production restaurant knows, cocktails are a key feature of the modern dining experience, with drink lists designed by celebrity mixologists like Dale DeGroff becoming more and more common. These days, the bar is viewed as an extension of the fine-dining kitchen. Accordingly, \"organic,\" \"farm-to-table\" and \"healthy\" are key booze buzzwords at Tales of the Cocktail. And let's not forget the emphasis on fresh, seasonal ingredients; artisanal spirits, bitters and syrups; DIY infusions and tinctures; molecular gastronomy–inspired playfulness; and food-and-cocktail pairings. With the cocktail's high-minded culinary aspirations, it's no wonder sophisticated patrons are reaching for the highball glass. \"Diners who used to start the evening with champagne are now starting with cocktails,\" says Todd Thrasher of DC's Restaurant Eve. Since restaurant profits are in the bottle, expect to see more and more venues adopting the bar-chef approach. \"A specialty cocktail program has become a low-cost way to maximize guest satisfaction, press and profitability,\" says Eben Klemm of B.R. Guest Restaurants. Typical cocktail cost margins range from about 15–25 percent; so that $15 cocktail you ordered at the bar while waiting to be summoned to your table? It cost about $3 to make. – Carla Spartos

Dale DeGroff, left, confers with judge Ted Allen of Top Chef at the fest's Bar Chef competition. photo: Carla Spartos Perhaps no one has had a greater influence on the American cocktail renaissance than mixologist Dale DeGroff. Walk into any restaurant or bar with a top-notch cocktail program and chances are he either created it or inspired whoever did. It's no surprise then that he seems to be the most popular guy at Tales of the Cocktail, with fans approaching him for autographs and bartenders for advice. The Buzz caught up with DeGroff after he led a jam-packed seminar on tequila Saturday afternoon. Zagat Buzz: What do you like best about Tales of the Cocktail? Dale DeGroff: The passion, the friends I don't get to see very often and this extraordinary New Orleans community, which comes out to support us in droves. And I like to think that since we've been coming here, the drinks in New Orleans have been getting better and better! ZB: Are you noticing any trends? DD: The conference is twice as big this year so I didn't get to attend as many seminars as I would have liked. Ann [Rogers, the festival's founder,] has us working pretty darn hard. But I'd say absinthe is a big presence. Now that it's allowed by the U.S. government, you're seeing quite a few brands. That's a good thing. ZB: How has the relationship between cocktails and fine-dining restaurants changed over the years? DD: First what you had was a movement in this country back to regional, seasonal, local foods, and away from processed ones. We became a wine drinking country again in the past 35 years. My boss and mentor, Joseph Baum of Restaurant Associates inspired a lot of chefs. He moved me to 19th-century cocktail recipes. He wanted to go back to that European way of local, regional cooking. He wanted this country to rediscover the American cocktail of the 19th century – no soda guns, no mixes, but real ingredients and recipes. Until that point, recipes weren't a part of the business' mindset. There were no great bartending schools. Now the industry is rediscovering the cocktail in the way it did real food. And the public is saying we've had enough of green neon liquid coming out of a soda gun. ZB: Are you currently working on any projects? DD: Lots of stuff. I just did menu work at Keith McNally's new Italian restaurant in New York, Morandi. And I've been working with Colin Cowie on his first Sea Bar, which just opened in the Belvedere Hotel in Mykonos. ZB: Do you have a hangover remedy that you could recommend? DD: There are two ways to cure a hangover. One is, don't start drinking. Number two is, don't stop drinking. Or you can try soaking your feet in oatmeal. – Carla Spartos

Ted Breaux serving his Lucid absinthe at Tales of the Cocktail. photo: Carla Spartos Seemingly everywhere you turn here at Tales of the Cocktail, someone’s pushing absinthe, the bitter, anise-flavored spirit distilled from wormwood made famous by Belle Époque artists and madmen. Within 24 hours of arriving in the Big Easy, the Buzz was invited to sample no less than three brands, including Lucid, La Fée and Marteau. But isn't absinthe illegal in the U.S.? Apparently the law only prohibits absinthe that contains more than 10 mg per liter of thujone, the active ingredient in wormwood, and most \"authentic\" absinthe contains less than that amount. And so this March, U.S. regulators approved Lucid, making it the first absinthe to be legally distributed on these shores in 95 years. It hit the shelves in New York last month, where it retails for $59.95 a bottle. It will soon be available in all 50 states, according to its creator, New Orleans–born chemist Ted Breaux. La Fée absinthe tasting. photo: Carla Spartos Now others are trying to elbow their way into the market. Gwydion Stone, the pony-tailed founder of Seattle’s Wormwood Society, is hoping to release his Swiss-made absinthe, Marteau, in October. And the U.K.-based La Fée – poured at posh London hotels such as Claridge’s and Sanderson – is in New Orleans gauging the American audience. It's enthusiastic, according to Breaux, who says the \"whole country assaulted New York\" in an attempt to get their hands on the initial shipments of Lucid. Traditionally served diluted with water and tempered with sugar, absinthe is now popping up in cocktails in trendy bars. In NYC, Employees Only shakes up a Lucid mojito while Milk and Honey uses La Fée in its Sea Fizz cocktail. Breaux says he has received numerous inquiries from fine-dining restaurants too. What about tales of green fairies and lopped-off earlobes? “Properly distilled, there is nothing harmful about absinthe,” says Breaux, who maintains that bad alcohol from unscrupulous distillers is to blame for the spirit’s 19th-century notoriety. As for Van Gogh, “He was drinking loads of other alcohol,” says a La Fée rep. “And smoking all kinds of weed.” – Carla Spartos

Audrey Saunders at Commander's Palace. photo: Carla Spartos On a recent episode of Top Chef, one of the contestants, Hung, complained that cocktails are not appropriate for pairing with the \"refined, beautiful, elegant food I cook.\" He was chafing at a Quickfire Challenge in which he and his fellow competitors were each asked to create a dish to pair with a different gin-based tipple. While Hung's comments may have been colored by his loss, he did have a point. Would a serious chef venture into martini territory? Doesn't alcohol deaden the palate? For better or worse, the contest illustrated a recent preoccupation with the pairing of food and hard booze – a trend that was clearly in evidence Thursday night at Tales of the Cocktail, when \"spirited\" dinners showcasing the handiwork of all the star mixologists in town were hosted at an array of esteemed NOLA restaurants. Last night, the Buzz attended one such dinner at the famed Commander's Palace featuring guest mixologists Dale DeGroff and Audrey Saunders of NYC's Pegu Club. Of the evening's five courses, the winning match proved to be an entree of bourbon and sugarcane smoked duck served with a Blood & Sand cocktail (an odd yet compelling mix of scotch, sweet vermouth, orange juice and cherry brandy). But the meal was also a potent reminder of the perils of such a pairing, namely that it's nigh impossible to enjoy the experience without winding up half in the bag (one gentleman who shall remain nameless arrived at Commander's Palace so blotto, it was all he could do to keep his head up through the blur of glasses and plates). Thankfully, the cocktail pairing trend generally embraces smaller pours, with two-ounce portions being the most prevalent according to John Kinder of Chicago's Pump Room. Sometimes they're even alternated with wine: Todd Thrasher of DC's Restaurant Eve will throw a cocktail or two into the wine dinner mix. Yet Thrasher concedes the format works best with a group. After all, \"They're out to have a party.\" – Carla Spartos

By Jeff Freier, ZAGAT.com staff editor (and softball coach) Top spots for brews and wings after you swing Grab a post-game PBR at Brother Jimmy's BBQ. photo: Noah Kalina Summertime. Sunshine. Beer. Groin pulls. What does it all add up to? Why, softball season, of course. On opening day there's the smell of fresh cut grass, a new season filled with hope and the annual office pool for betting on which star of the company team ends up in the hospital first. And now with the playoffs in view, the pressure is mounting, veterans are coming off the disabled list, teams are shaving their company's logo into their hair and co-workers may actually come out to support their colleagues, even if just to get in on the post-game drinking – which, let's face it, is the main reason for some teams' existence in the first place. Softball Bars Upper West Side Upper East Side West 40s/50s Chelsea Village Lower East Side/East Village The post-game scene isn't always pretty – one player will inevitably have one too many Zimas, stand up on a table, take off his shirt and belt out that old country chestnut \"If Drinking 12 Beers and Passing Out Naked in My Backyard is Wrong, I Don't Want to Be Right.\" But it's a hallowed tradition, and deciding which bar the team will head to after the game can be as important a strategic question as who's pitching and what the batting order will be. So whether you're looking to celebrate the thrill of victory or soothe the agony of defeat, here are some suitable options located near some of the city's busiest softball battlegrounds, which include the fields in the Uptown parks (Riverside, Morningside, Thomas Jefferson and Central), DeWitt Clinton in the West 50s, Chelsea Park, James J.

A morning seminar kicks off with a Smoker's Delight cocktail. photo: Carla Spartos The genius of Tales of the Cocktail is that while most conferences are packed with presentations, roundtables and meetings, all seemingly a pretense for the marathon drink-a-thons that take place in the hotel bar (that's networking to you, pal), here in New Orleans, they don't bother with the subterfuge. Here, the seminars are actually about booze. At most, you even get to imbibe. \"The goal is to be pleasantly tipsy the whole time,\" explains Esquire cocktail guru Dave Wondrich from a seat at the revolving Carousel Bar. It seems like most conference attendees are taking Wondrich's advice. And how could they not? First, there's the nice British gentleman pushing La Fee absinthe upstairs in the Hotel Monteleone's Ernest Hemingway Room (positively literary, we know). Then there are the assorted seminars complete with their very own bartenders. The Buzz just returned from one entitled, \"Chains committed to using fresh and quality ingredients and how they do it!,\" where panelists discussed the Next Big Things in the cocktail world, including: Thai basil; fresh chai syrup; herbs and spices; and seasonal and organic ingredients. And let's not forget the importance of \"spanking\" one's mint. After all, as one expert explained, cocktails are more than just \"alcohol delivery vehicles.\" Apparently. But more on that later – it's almost 5 PM and the Buzz has to throw on its little black dress, then dash off to the Hotel Montelone's Ballroom for the conference's official Cocktail Hour. We've got a feeling there's a long evening of networking ahead. – Carla Spartos

Wanna ride? The bull usually wins. Just remember that when Johnny Utah's (named after Keanu Reeves' character in Point Break) opens its subterranean Rockefeller Center doors to the public for pricey Southwestern cuisine and mechanical bull riding on Thursday, August 2nd (serving drinks only starting July 23). At the pre-opening bash on Tuesday, July 17th, the guest roundup included the Naked Cowboy, America's Next Top Model season seven winner Caridee English, along with the usual crowd of investment bankers and restaurant insiders. Cocktails highlighting the bar's extensive whiskey and tequila selections inspired many to try their luck at riding the mechanical bull. After signing the required waivers, riders ranging from a drunk but persistent young woman in a short dress – not the best outfit for bull riding – to an older gent clinging on the bull's back to a younger dude who was hurled vigorously off the bucking beast took their turns. And of course, the Naked Cowboy (who is not actually naked but wears tighty whities with his cowboy boots and a cowboy hat), having come all the way from his usual haunt of Times Square, took a ride. Johnny Utah's candlelit, ranchlike room, an experiment in manufactured rusticity, features the bull ring and also has an expansive bar and banquettes. Smaller rooms, including one inside a former bank vault for very private dining, offer a more intimate experience away from center stage (25 W. 51st St.; 212-265-8824). Johnny Utah's

The fifth-annual Tales of the Cocktail, a five-day gathering of cocktail geeks, bar chefs, booze marketers, journos and assorted other \"connoisseurs\" gets underway tomorrow, July 18th, in New Orleans, and Zagat Buzz will be on hand to bring you the highlights. Think of it as a more highbrow version of Mardi Gras, with the usual hurricanes and halter-tops replaced by absinthe frappés and guys with long, scraggly beards. The city that gave us the Sazerac and the Ramos Gin Fizz is the obvious place to host a convention celebrating the birth of the cocktail. (The origins of the word “cocktail” are murky, though one plausible explanation is that it derives from the “coquetiers” or egg cups used for serving brandy mixtures at Antoine Peychaud's Royal Street apothecary shop some time after the revolution.) And with its old-timey patina and revolving Carousel Bar, the Hotel Monteleone is the obvious choice at which to center the festival’s seminars and soirees, which run through Sunday, July 22nd, when attendees presumably trudge home with the worst hangovers of their lives. Look for Buzz coverage starting on Thursday, when things really get shaking with an assortment of seminars (Swizzle Stick Bar's Ti Adelaide Martin on “Drinks and Dishes Born in New Orleans,” Milk and Honey's Sasha Petraske on “The Importance of Ice,” etc.), a happy hour to end all happy hours at the Hotel Monteleone and – reflective of an age in which hot new eateries debut with credentialed cocktail programs – \"spirited\" dinners at restaurants around NOLA, including Antoine’s, Arnaud’s, Café Adelaide and Commander’s Palace.

From the folks who brought you Café d'Alsace, Marseille and Nice Matin comes Côte d'Or, a new French restaurant opening tomorrow in TriBeCa at 225 Varick Street (212-727-2775). As you might have guessed from the name, its menu will focus on the cuisine of Burgundy, offering rustic dishes like cassoulet of snails and beef bourguignon that can be paired with the region's famous wines. Intrepid foodies take note: To make up for any opening kinks, the bistro is slashing 15% off the food portion of diners' tabs through Sunday, July 29th.

What are your best and worst Restaurant Week experiences? Share your stories with us on the Zagat Discussion boards! Summer Restaurant Week kicks off today, and as diners who’ve been through the drill before know, landing reservations is only half the battle when it comes to getting the most out of the promotion. The other half is figuring out which places are offering the biggest bang for the buck, since not all Restaurant Week menus are created equal. To zero in on some best bets, Zagat Buzz contacted 209 restaurants and analyzed 69 menus that will be featured during the event, which runs from July 16th–20th and 23rd–27th, with participating restaurants offering three-course deals for lunch ($24.07) and/or dinner ($35). What did we find? A preponderance of grilled chicken and pork, plus several instances of black ruff, a fish that’s not exactly topping the piscine popularity charts. But we also found plenty of more interesting options, with some of the standouts noted below. Beef is pricey, which helps explain why hanger steak – a cheaper, albeit perfectly tasty, cut – is a Restaurant Week standby. Expect to find some of the better cuts at dinner, when diners have to cough up about $11 more for the meal. Steakhouses offering filet mignon without charging extra (aka the notorious Restaurant Week “supplement”) include Bobby Van’s Grill at 135 West 50th Street, Frankie & Johnnie’s at 32 West 37th Street, Maloney & Porcelli and Michael Jordan’s – though note that the menus at the last three specify that their filets are “petit.” Filet mignon isn't the only choice entree you'll find: At dinner, Thalassa serves a grilled lamb chop with a rosemary demi-glaze sauce, French beans and fingerling potatoes. At lunch, Tocqueville offers lamb chop Milanese with wild arugula, olives and fresh bean “meli melo.” Other notable lunch options include the Kobe beef burger at both branches of Megu (but beware of the fine print at the bottom of the menu: “Maximum of 100 Orders Limited per Day”) and the American Kobe beef sliders with cheddar cheese, pickled jalapeños and onion rings at Zoë Townhouse. If you prefer surf over turf, consider these lunchtime options: soft-shell crab sandwich or miso-glazed mahi-mahi at Atlantic Grill; Grand Marnier shrimp at Chin Chin; wild king salmon and butterscotch panna cotta at davidburke & donatella; and monster maki rolls and seared ahi tuna at both outposts of Ruby Foo’s. For those who like to keep their options open, JoJo offers choices from an array of small plates. Others go beyond the usual three courses. Both Zoë and Zoë Townhouse are offering a deal on wine (one $6 glass of wine from two selections at lunch, or a $19.92 three-course wine pairing at dinner), as is Asiate ($15 for a wine and sake pairing at lunch) and Beacon ($6 for a glass of wine at lunch, $9 at dinner). Finally, Centrico throws in a starter of guacamole and chips that doesn't count toward your trio. See Zagat-Rated Restaurant Week Participants and Make Reservations

Eco-chic eateries are all the rage, with trendy \"sustainable\" restaurants popping up around the globe, from Abode in LA to Acorn in London. But is the trend becoming just another publicity ploy? Last month, we reported that B.R. Guest Restaurants' NY eateries had achieved \"certification of green status\" by the Green Restaurant Association, a national nonprofit that promotes environmental practices in the industry. To get certified, the chain beefed up its recycling program, installed water-efficient faucets and banned Styrofoam products. So far so good. But now comes word that B.R. Guest is debuting an \"Earth Friendly Margarita,\" the Tierra Mojada, in time for Restaurant Week, which kicks off next week. So what exactly makes it \"earth friendly?\" According to its list of ingredients, the not-exactly-wallet-friendly $14 cocktail boasts Siembra Azul Blanco Tequila, agave nectar and – hold on, here comes the green part – \"local\" peaches and \"organic\" limes. We can't wait to see what some eco-minded marketer comes up with next.

The first Manhattan branch of Five Guys is opening at 43 W. 55th Street. photo: Liz Borod Wright Call it the gourmet burger backlash. Five Guys, the VA-based patty purveyor, is coming to town, and you won't find Kobe on the menu, but rather, as one Zagat surveyor lovingly put it, a \"heart attack in a sac.\" No-frills digs are also part of the package, so it's no surprise the chain's first Manhattan branch is debuting in a former Chinese restaurant at 43 W. 55th Street. In April, Five Guys opened its first NYC outpost in College Point, Queens (132-01 14th Ave.; 718-767-6500), while a second branch opened this month in Brooklyn Heights (138 Montague St.; 718-797-9380). In all, some 20 locations are planned.

Check out that big hunk o' salt! photo: Emily Capo Key lime–flavored cheese from Oregon. Tangerine Chardonnay Wine Vinegar from Chile. Lemonmint water from Metro Mint of San Francisco. All these delicacies could be found in the extravaganza of free tastings and displays (think lots of olive oil, spreads and chocolate) that is the three-day 53rd Summer Fancy Food Show at the Jacob K. Javits Center, which wrapped up today, July 10th. With 25,000 buyers walking down the trade show aisles, some of these newfangled gourmet items could be coming to a market or eatery near you. Salt is perhaps the original condiment, and yet somehow it's become trendy again, with restaurants like The French Laundry offering different types of salt to complement its foie gras course. The Redmond Trading Company, a Utah-based company that sells RealSalt put up an impressive display (pictured above) with a huge salt rock and a frightening message: \"Is your salt real?\" Apparently, theirs is. Meals in a Muffin photo: Emily Capo Forget blueberry or bran. The muffin finally sheds its breakfast stigma with Barbara Gayle's Meals in a Muffin, which contain savory ingredients such as ham and asparagus, chicken and broccoli or Italian meatballs and veggies. While you probably won't ever find Meals in a Muffin on a trendy New American menu, they could show up in a hipster hangout (in an ironic way, natch). At the very least, perhaps they'll make it to your local supermarket. These chopped up tamarillos made a long trip. photo: Emily Capo The friendly folks from the New Zealand Trade and Enterprise showed up with avocado oils and tamarillos (shown above). Tamarillos, which are tart little fruits, originally hail from Peru but are being harvested in New Zealand. This exotic fruit is very versatile and works in sauces and chutneys, and even on vanilla ice cream. Just don't eat the skin! Onion juice and other goodies from Korea photo: Emily Capo While tamarillos look like they have a good chance of catching on (tamarillo-tini, anyone?), the same can't be said for onion juice (above) from Korea, even if it does have the endearing name of Dr. Onion. The juice also offers plenty of health benefits and has a sweet, not-too-strong taste, the exhibitor assured us. Fruit and \"flora\" teas from Singapore photo: Emily Capo A refreshing change, these fruit and \"flora\" teas from Naté of Singapore looked as beautiful as any potpourri. With good looks and innovative flavors like Sweet Fruit (apple, papaya, cherry, pineapple, raspberry, rosehips and hibiscus) and straight floral flavors like marigold and pink rosebud (which the company says has antidepressant powers), perhaps these teas could one day give Earl Grey a run for his money.

The future homes of Los Dados, Double Seven and Merkato. photo: Emily Capo Just when you thought that the cobblestoned streets of the Meatpacking District were witnessing a lull in activity, three high-profile projects are in full swing on Gansevoort between Washington and Greenwich streets. First up is Los Dados, a new Mexican restaurant from Lotus partners David Rabin and Will Regan in the former home of Meet (71-73 Gansevoort St.). Rabin describes it as \"casual, authentic, accessible\" – expect co-owner Sue Torres (Sueños) in the kitchen when it debuts later this summer. Next door, the Lotus folks are also busy readying the second coming of Double Seven in the old Rhône space (63 Gansevoort St.). Those familiar with the swanky cocktail lounge's first incarnation will recognize the leather-and-mahogany decor, though a few surprises await – including an interior that's about 700 sq. ft. bigger, and the addition of a light menu and some outdoor seats. A bit further east, chef Marcus Samuelsson (Aquavit) is readying Merkato, inspired by his travels in Africa researching his book, The Soul of a New Cuisine: A Discovery of the Foods and Flavors of Africa. The restaurant, which borrows its name from a food market in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, will explore African cooking and its influences on the cuisines of the world, including the American South and Brazil. It's scheduled to open in September in the old Sascha digs (55-61 Gansevoort St.).

Watch the fireworks from the Water's Edge. A classic – and cheap – way to celebrate Independence Day is to take a trip to Coney Island to watch the annual Nathan's International July Fourth Hot Dog Eating Contest, which kicks off at noon. If competitive eating isn't your thing, consider a meal at a restaurant with a view of Macy's 4th of July Fireworks, which will blaze across the East River and rocket over South Street Seaport and the Brooklyn Bridge at 9 PM. Harbour Lights: This seaport seafooder offers a panoramic view of the bridges – and the light show (6–9 PM; $60 per person, includes three-course meal and tea or coffee; reservations required). Nelson Blue: The sidewalk cafe of this New Zealander also features Brooklyn Bridge sight lines (11 AM–2 AM; reservations not required). Water Club: Take in the display from a pricey perch on this East River barge (7 PM seating; $320.94 per person, includes three-course dinner, open bar, tax and gratuity; reservations required). Water's Edge: The Manhattan skyline is the backdrop for the main event at this Long Island City New American (6:30–7 PM seating; $225 per person, includes three-course dinner, open bar, tax and gratuity; reservations required).

More than 80 percent of city restaurants have switched to trans-fat-free frying oils, according to a recent Health Department survey. As of July 1st, NYC eateries – from fast-food joints to temples of haute cuisine – can no longer use partially hydrogenated vegetable oils, shortenings or margarines for frying and spreading if they contain more than 0.5 grams of trans fat per serving. The ban will extend to baked goods and prepared foods starting July 1st, 2008. In a statement, Health Commissioner Dr. Thomas R. Frieden said the results of the study \"confirms that the switch is feasible.\" The city has set up a Trans Fat Help Center to assist restaurants with the transition; for more information, visit www.notransfatnyc.org. See the Department of Health Press Release

By Robert Seixas, ZAGAT.com staff editor The laudatory loaves at L'Atelier de Joël Robuchon. photo: Emily Capo Do you agree that bread is still often treated as an afterthought? What places have most impressed you with their bread? Tell us what you think on the Zagat Discussion boards! In restaurants, nothing symbolizes hospitality like bread. Or at least, nothing should symbolize hospitality like bread. But all too often, cold rocks and stale slices are the norm, and what should represent a warm welcome winds up tasting – and feeling – like an icy greeting. Of course, there are exceptions, where the kitchen puts time, effort and thought into their bread service, with glorious results. Some restaurants elect to make their own breads in-house, as is the case with the crunchy, airy loaves – crosses between ciabatta and focaccia – made each day (right after midnight) at Sfoglia on the Upper East Side. “We use a starter dough – the term is 'pâte fermentée' – that’s eight years old,” says co-owner/pastry chef Colleen Marnell-Suhanosky. Each bread there, in a sense, can trace its origins to its \"mother.\" L'Atelier de Joël Robuchon’s petite baguettes are noteworthy in their own right. “We don’t use an old dough,\" says Jeff Sytsma, a tournant in the restaurant’s baking/pastry department. “We do use a starter dough made from water, apples, raisins, malt syrup and lemon juice, which ferments for about six days.” Rye flour is then added, and the fermentation begins again, in what Sytsma calls an overall “costly” process. Bottom line aside, the preponderance of tiny kitchens in this city means most restaurants balk at the idea of making breads on site. But a few have defied space constraints by capitalizing on the resources and expertise of established outfits. Blue Hill works with Tom Cat Bakery to produce the restaurant’s ficelle-like loaves. “When the bread comes to us, it’s 75% baked,” explains executive chef/co-owner Dan Barber. “We finish the cooking in-house, and the effect is the bread feels freshly baked.” Similarly, at Café Gray, the flaxseed bread (based on an old Swiss milk dough recipe) is produced by Blue Ribbon Bakery, \"according to our specifics,” says chef-owner Gray Kunz. “We worked for months to get it right.” (Sullivan Street Bakery will supply the breads at Kunz’s forthcoming Grayz.) In the end, a little ingenuity – and hard work – can go a long way to satisfying diners and setting the right tone for the meal to follow. Why then does it seem that so many places treat bread as an afterthought when it should be a principal consideration?

On Tuesday, Pearl Oyster Bar owner Rebecca Charles filed a lawsuit against Ed McFarland, a former employee and current chef-owner of Ed's Lobster Bar in SoHo, for allegedly copying “each and every element” of her restaurant. But McFarland is far from the first restaurant employee to strike off on his own, armed with a kitchen secret or two. (In fact, he's not even the first disciple of Charles's to run with the seafood shack formula – that honor goes to Mary Redding of Mary's Fish Camp.) Below, a few NYC eateries (and a certain little bakery) so popular, they've spawned a host of successful imitators operated by ex-staffers. Lombardi's: Gennaro Lombardi, who founded this NoLita institution in 1905, trained the pizza makers who went on to create Totonno's, John's and, depending on who you talk to, Patsy's. Magnolia Bakery: This wildly successful West Village bakery has launched several copycat cupcake shops – Buttercup Bake Shop, Billy's Bakery and Sugar Sweet Sunshine. Mr. Chow: In 2005, chef Philippe Chow left this clubby East Sider to open Philippe, sparking a feud and fueling a Page 6 item claiming that Mr. Chow owner Michael Chow (no relation to Philippe) had intimidated vendors in a bid to stop them from supplying his rival. A Miami Beach branch of Philippe is set to debut this summer. Papaya King: A former partner of this wiener wonder began peddling a suspiciously similar dogs-and-fruit-drinks combo in 1973 with Gray's Papaya. Peter Luger Steak House: The king of NYC steakhouses has, by far, inspired the greatest number of clones, with former staffers opening Ben & Jack's Steak House, Benjamin Steakhouse, Blair Perrone Steakhouse, MarkJoseph Steakhouse and – its most successful knock-off – Wolfgang's Steakhouse.

What is your opinion of the lawsuit? Can a chef sue for \"theft of intellectual property\"? Tell us what you think on the Zagat Discussion boards! Yesterday, Pearl Oyster Bar owner Rebecca Charles filed a lawsuit against Ed McFarland, a former employee and current chef-owner of Ed's Lobster Bar in SoHo, for allegedly copying “each and every element” of her restaurant, a tribute to the coast of Maine. According to an article in today's New York Times, those elements include \"the white marble bar, the gray paint on the wainscoting, the chairs and bar stools with their wheat-straw backs, the packets of oyster crackers placed at each table setting and the dressing on the Caesar salad.\" McFarland wouldn't comment on the suit but told the Times his seafood shack was no copy.

Luke Fryer, who owns 13 Wagamama restaurants by franchise in Australia, has invaded NYC with the opening this month of Yushi, a new \"deliciously Zen\" sushi and bento box spot with outposts at 245 Park Avenue (47th St.) and 250 Vesey Street (World Financial Center). The 47th Street location, which debuts today, has 74 seats and specializes in bento box lunches and dinners, under chef Shaun Presland. The Financial District location opened last week, replacing a branch of Itsu, the London-based sushi chain that set up shop last year in Manhattan. For the new venture, Fryer's teamed up with Spencer Rothschild, who is a co-owner of BLT Prime, Calle Ocho, Django and Rain.

It's official: Brasserie LCB, which shuttered its doors in March 2007 after a damning Department of Health visit, is closed. Alain Ducasse has taken over the West 55th Street space, home to the second incarnation of the fabled La Côte Basque, where he plans to open an outpost of his Benoît bistro early next year. Back in January, Wayne Nish and Joseph Scalice overhauled March, their longtime UES fine-dining option, in an attempt to make it more casual. The resulting restaurant, Nish, closed this week.

This season, the young and the restless are flocking to Dune Southampton. Summertime newcomers have hit the East End's dining and nightlife scenes, many of them with familiar names attached. East Hampton gets a taste of steak, sushi and DJ sets at Ed 'Jean-Luc' Kleefield's Prime 103, along with brick-oven pizza at Matto, and margs and music at 27 Authentic Mexican Kitchen on Napeague Stretch. The opening of Tutto Il Giorno, the chic Italian by chef Scott Conant and co-owner Steve Florio, fuels the continuing ascent of Sag Harbor, which also sees the arrival of Kleefield's Black Buoy Bar and Grill and the seductive new lounge at Sen. Meanwhile, chef Matthew Guiffrida's Muse in Water Mill inspires diners with its exotic digs, dishes and martinis. On the late-night edge, the posh Dune Southampton and Stereo by the Shore keep the music pumping and bottle service flowing, while Hampton Bays' Whitehouse attracts islanders looking to let loose. – Karen Hudes More Hamptons Nightlife

Tough-talking Joey, who found himself in the bottom three in episode two, is the executive chef at NYC's legendary romantic spot, Café des Artistes. Tre wound up there too, and he's chef de cuisine at Dallas' Abacus, which scores a whopping 28 for Food. The other toque who hails from a top-rated place is Lia, an executive sous-chef at Jean Georges, which also has a 28 Food score. Check out the list below to learn more about where the contestants most recently worked. Note: The five contenders who aren't listed did not work at restaurants immediately before the show.

Gordon Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmare

A former manager of Purnima, aka Dillons, is suing Gordon Ramsay. photo: Liz Borod Wright On Tuesday, Gordon Ramsay was smacked with a multimillion-dollar lawsuit filed by a participant in his upcoming Fox reality TV series, Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares, in which the celebrity chef swoops into failing restaurants to save them from the brink of disaster. This time, the restaurant to be rehabilitated was Dillons, aka Purnima, a midtown Indian restaurant at 245 West 54th Street that also houses a pub. (The history of the space is as convoluted as a plot twist in a made-for-TV movie – Dillons morphed into Nirvana 54 in October of last year before recently transitioning into Purnima. Yet it's managed to hang onto the Dillons moniker despite all its guises.) But instead of saving the restaurant, the lawsuit, filed by former Dillons GM Martin Hyde, alleges that the show is \"a prime example of Fake TV,\" and that Ramsay hired actors to play new customers in order to demonstrate the success of his makeover. The decor at Dillons, post Ramsay visit. photo: Liz Borod Wright Interestingly, the personal release signed by participants in Kitchen Nightmares states that the \"appearance, depiction, and/or portrayal of you and in connection with the Series and your actions and of others displayed in and in connection with the Series, may be disparaging, defamatory, embarrassing or of an otherwise unfavorable nature, may expose you to public ridicule, humiliation or condemnation, and may portray you in a false light.\" This isn't the first time Ramsay has gotten into hot water while filming Nightmares. Last year, he won a ₤75,000 payout in a libel suit against The Evening Standard, which had accused him of faking scenes for the British version of the show. At the time, Ramsay said, \"I won't let people write anything they want to about me.\" Read Martin Hyde's Complaint Against Gordon Ramsay

Will Southern Hospitality be ready to open in just one month? photo: Liz Borod Wright Judging by the construction workers congregated inside, Southern Hospitality, pop star Justin Timberlake's Upper East Side BBQ restaurant (1460 Second Ave.), looks like it will finally see the light of day. Originally scheduled to debut in April, the eatery is now aiming for a mid-July opening, according to its publicist. This will be the second NYC entry for Timberlake, who also co-owns Destino, the Midtown East Italian. photo: Liz Borod Wright BBQ joints may be to Memphis (where Timberlake was born) what pizzerias are to NYC, so perhaps that's why Timberlake and company chose the somewhat daring location – just one block down from <a href\"/verticals/PropertyDetails.aspx?VID=8&R=50055\">Brother Jimmy's BBQ, the popular post-collegiate watering hole that promises to \"Put Some South in Yo' Mouth.\" But with its dark-wood setting, Southern Hospitality looks a bit fancier than its neighbor, renowned for its trailer-park-meets-frathouse decor.

The Man Behind the Restaurant

***CONTENT
By Ingrid Cheng ZAGAT.com talks to Jeffrey Chodorow about his restaurant empire, his new projects and, of course, his beef with The New York Times You may remember Jeffrey Chodorow as Rocco DiSpirito's antagonist on NBC's The Restaurant, or as the man who took out a $40,000 full-page ad in The New York Times this past February, lambasting restaurant critics for carrying insufficient dining credentials after less-than-stellar reviews of his NYC steakhouse, Kobe Club. Either way, Jeffrey Chodorow is also one of the most prolific restaurateurs in the country. As head of China Grill Management, he controls more than 25 restaurants, from London's new Suka to long-running hits like Asia de Cuba and the company's namesake, China Grill. A lifelong foodie with no formal restaurant experience, Chodorow, a financier, opened NYC's China Grill in 1987, thinking it would be fun. It apparently was, since he soon made the jump from hobbyist to full-fledged restaurateur. We recently caught up with Chodorow by phone to discuss his work, his beef with critics and his new restaurant, Borough Food and Drink (12 E. 22nd St.; 212-260-0103), which opens in NYC this week. ZS: How did you come up with the concept for Borough Food and Drink, which you're opening with Zak Pelaccio as consulting chef? JC: When I was talking with Zak about what we wanted to do, I said to him, 'There's such phenomenal things made by small producers in New York City. What if we collected them all in one place where you could buy those ingredients? And what if we used those ingredients in dishes we made for the restaurant?' And Zak's really into the quality of the source of the product, so it just seemed like a really cool idea. We spent days and days and days going to the hinterlands – as close as Manhattan and as far away as Staten Island – to sample things. ZS: How much research goes into a restaurant concept? JC: A lot. For Kobe Club, we did research on Kobe beef, on the differences between American, Australian and Japanese Wagyu beef, [on] sourcing. When we opened Ono, we went to Japan several times to try things. Borough is a very big research job because, again, it's product-driven. Asia de Cuba took a year of trying food every day, three or four dishes a day, to get that menu correct. ZS: You just opened Suka in London with Zak. After Borough Food and Drink, will there be more restaurants with him? JC: Yes, I'm doing a couple other projects with Zak. All I can say is that it's going to be more toward an Asian bent. [Editor's Note: The duo reportedly has plans to open Kopi Tiam, a \"Malaysian coffeehouse\" concept on NYC's Upper West Side.] ZS: What draws you to him? JC: He's a very intelligent, genuine, hard-working guy who has tremendous respect for the business. Even though he's achieved a lot of success for a young kid, you would never know it when you talked to him. When my corporate chef, who has a lot of experience, said “That won't work for the following reasons,” [Zak] said to me, “You know, I can learn a lot from this guy.” That's not my experience, generally, with so-called celebrity chefs. He wants to be a team player. ZS: It was reported last year that you would be opening a gastropub named Spotted Dick. JC: I was never doing that. I was at a cocktail party in the Hamptons and I was kidding around with somebody and someone overheard me saying it. It was a joke. ZS: How do you determine if a restaurant concept is viable? JC: I will you tell you that I thought [NYC's now shuttered] Caviar and Banana was – maybe a bad name, I'll concede – actually a great restaurant. But critics didn't like it. They got there so early that I think that did have an impact, and there [were] some negative connotations associated with the space with Rocco's situation. You could do the greatest concept in the world, and think you've got everything right, and for reasons which you don't even understand, it may not work. This is a very fickle business. ZS: Do you have any plans for expanding beyond cities where you are now? JC: I'm looking at Shanghai. I have several international places that I'm interested in, which sounds a little crazy because people say to me, 'Oh, you won't open a restaurant in Philadelphia, but you'll go to Shanghai?' I said, 'Well, yeah.' I went to school in Philadelphia, and I have a farm outside Philadelphia, and to go back to Philadelphia to open a restaurant wouldn't interest me that much. But Shanghai would be exciting. ZS: In February, you famously criticized Frank Bruni in a full-page ad in The New York Times. Have you felt any impact from that? JC: Every critic in London who wrote something about Suka started out with three paragraphs on me taking the ad out, and you know, some people loved it, some people thought it was stupid, some people thought I lost my mind, it was a rant. What I was really trying to do was point out that we're not getting a PhD in food science and gastronomy doing these things. These [critics] are people who are really proficient in other areas and who, because they write well, are put into this position. I would be satisfied if The New York Times would simply say at the top of the page, 'Here's the review by our restaurant critic. Before coming to this, he did the following, and has no substantial food background.' Really, there were only two points. One was, let's just be honest about your credentials. And number two is, just understand that when you criticize a restaurant, it really hurts the people who work at the restaurant. ZS: Have you learned anything from restaurant critics? JC: Oh yeah, I learn things all the time. We read everything and we go back and we look at things that they say. Even if they don't say it in a constructive way, there [are] constructive things you can take from it. ZS: What's next on your plate? JC: Summer vacation. And my 25th wedding anniversary.

Beyond Egg Rolls: When Will the U.S. Get Real Chinese Cuisine?

***CONTENT
Do you agree with Nina and Tim Zagat? What is your favorite Chinese restaurant? Tell us what you think on the Zagat Discussion boards! Every so often, Chinese cuisine seems poised to shed its tired takeout-staple image and join the Asian dining boom that has swept the U.S. in recent decades. Yet it has never taken off in the way that Japanese, Thai, Vietnamese and Korean cuisines have. Why has it lagged behind? Nina and Tim Zagat offer some thoughts in yesterday's New York Times: \"There is a historic explanation for the abysmal state of Chinese cuisine in the United States. Without access to key ingredients from their homeland, Chinese immigrants working on the Central Pacific Railroad in the 1860s improvised dishes like chow mein and chop suey that nobody back in their native land would have recognized. To please the naïve palates of 19th-century Americans, immigrant chefs used sweet, rich sauces to coat the food – a radical departure from the spicy, chili-based dishes served back home. But today, getting ingredients is no longer an issue. Instead, the principal obstacle to improving Chinese fare here is the difficulty of getting visas for skilled workers since 9/11.\" See Nina and Tim's Op-Ed in The New York Times

The now-famous Holsten's onion rings photo: Liz Borod Wright What's your hometown version of Holsten's? What dish would you recommend to Tony Soprano? Tell us on the Zagat Discussion boards! Unless you've been living under a rock, you know that The Sopranos ended its six-season run on Sunday night. But what you might not know is that the final scene, which depicted Tony, A.J. and Carmela sitting in a New Jersey diner booth, was shot in Holsten’s in Bloomfield, NJ (1063 Broad St., 973-338-7091). As they're waiting for Meadow to arrive, the Sopranos munch on a bowl of onion rings (co-owner Chris Carley says Holsten's cooked the actual rings that were on TV) and talk about the importance of remembering the good times. Holsten's photo: Liz Borod Wright The setting at Holsten's is as authentically retro as the prices – the most expensive thing on the menu is the $8 \"house special\" (two burgers, lettuce, tomato, cole slaw and potato salad). It's now proudly selling \"final episode\" T-shirts at the candy counter. This is the actual booth where Tony, Carmela and A.J. sat. photo: Liz Borod Wright In the The Sopranos, there's a jukebox at the table, and Tony chooses \"Don't Stop Believing\" by Journey. But Holsten's doesn't have those little jukeboxes – they were brought in by the TV crew, which spent a total of five days filming there. While we didn't get to see the rest of the Sopranos' meal, Carley has some idea of what Tony would have ordered. \"Going by what [James Gandolfini] ate in between takes, he would have had a grilled cheese and a hot dog, probably both. Tony was a big eater.\" And if America's favorite mobsters made it to the end of dinner, they undoubtedly would have ordered the homemade ice cream – perhaps one of the towering sundaes.

Do restaurants have a responsibility to the environment? Tell us what you think on the Zagat Discussion boards! In March, Alice Waters' famed Chez Panisse restaurant announced it would no longer sell bottled water due to environmental concerns over waste, not only from packaging but from transporting it too. Now other restaurants are following suit, including Mario Batali and Joe Bastianich's Del Posto, which plans to stop selling the bottled stuff by the end of this summer. According to Bastianich, the restaurant will neutralize and purify NYC's finest through reverse osmosis, then add minerals and salts back into it to create a signature flavor profile. It won't come free, and while the price has yet to be determined, there will likely be a flat, per-person water charge. Says Bastianich: \"To spend fossil fuel trucking water around the world is absurd....Water should be as local as anything gets.\"

Craig Koketsu's green and yellow summer beans with apricot-almond vinaigrette and fresh mint A restaurant that changes with the seasons might sound gimmicky, but when the AvroKO design team (Quality Meats, Public, Stanton Social) is involved, you know something interesting is afoot. This time, they're teaming up with Michael Stillman (son of Alan) to launch Park Avenue Summer, the first of four seasonal restaurants to occupy the former Park Avenue Cafe space. Everything – from the decor to the lighting to the seating configuration – is designed to be easily altered and flipped. Scheduled to open for dinner on Thursday, June 7th, Park Avenue Summer will feature a menu by Craig Koketsu (also the executive chef at Quality Meats), a wine list emphasizing rosés and a breezy setting (think lemon-y yellow walls flecked with tortoise shells). Just don't get too attached: in early September, it will close briefly to make way for Park Avenue Autumn.

By Troy Segal, ZAGAT.com staff editor; From Best of the Buzz Related Stories Explore Other Hot Blocks Dinner and a show: it's a classic way to spend an evening in New York, for natives and visitors alike. In fact, 90% of theatergoers usually eat out before or after a show, according to one of our surveys. Small wonder that restaurants have been around the Theater District as long as the theaters themselves: Barbetta, perhaps the oldest in continuous operation, debuted in 1906 – two years after Times Square itself – and the legendary Sardi's dates from 1921. While there's never been a dearth of dining options in the Theater District – which runs roughly from West 42nd Street to West 55th Street, between 6th and 9th avenues – currently the area is seeing a spring awakening (to borrow the name of the hit musical) of new places. Some are a bit off the beaten Broadway path, but they're still well within walking distance and geared to get you to the show on time. The theatergoer's guide below offers a look at the area's latest dining options, plus a selection of bars and lounges for nightcaps and nibbles. We've also listed several conveniently located hotels for those spending the night. Now, all you need is theater tickets for a quintessential NYC-style night on the town. Map of Theater District View: Theaters Restaurants Bars Hotels Restaurants view map A Amalia 204 W. 55th St.(bet. B'way & 7th Ave.), 212-245-1234 www.amalia-nyc.com Named after Sigmund Freud's mother (her portrait adorns one of the rooms), this bi-level newcomer blends baroque and modernistic design touches in a dreamlike fashion; culinary analysts may well intuit some Mediterranean influences in the New American menu. B Anthos 36 W. 52nd St. (bet. 5th & 6th Aves.), 212-582-6900 Meaning \"new beginning,\" this recently opened eatery features an haute Greek menu composed by chef Michael Psilakis (also of Kefi); partner Donatella Arpaia (davidburke & donatella) has imbued the grand, glass-enclosed setting with a pink-and-brown-hued, cherry blossom theme. C Blue Ribbon Sushi Bar & Grill Coming Soon 6 Columbus Circle, 308 W. 58th St. (bet. 8th & 9th Aves.), no phone yet (slated to open this summer) Scheduled for a summer opening, this Midtown outpost of the beloved Blue Ribbon and Blue Ribbon Sushi establishments will combine the best elements of both.

G Hawaiian Tropic Zone 729 Seventh Ave. (49th St.), 212-626-7312 www.hawaiiantropiczone.com They've spared no expense (reputedly $11 million) at this sprawling new beach party–themed venue, the self-styled \"hottest place on earth\" (or at least Times Square); plentiful cocktails, video-screen pin-ups, a New American menu by David Burke (davidburke & donatella) and bikini-clad waitresses all suit the suits who congregate here. H Insieme Hotel Michelangelo, 777 Seventh Ave. (bet. 50th & 51st Sts.), 212-582-1310 Marco Canora's elegant new ristorante in the Michelangelo Hotel means \"together\" in Italian, a nod to its menu presenting old-world dishes and modern interpretations side by side; the muted, contemporary setting reflects its adult aspirations, providing an urbane sanctuary from the gritty Midtown bustle outside.

B'way & 8th Ave.), 212-307-9797 www.nirvanacuisine.net Though relocated from its longtime Central Park South perch, this Indian has nonetheless retained its colorful style, with silk brocade banquettes and a ceiling draped in exotic cotton prints; they serve until 1 AM – perfect for a post-show subcontinental supper. M Sushi of Gari 46 347 W. 46th St. (bet. 8th & 9th Aves.), 212-957-0046 Chef Gari Sugio continues to expand his Japanese empire with this entry on Restaurant Row; the lengthy menu of avant-garde offerings includes over 130 varieties of sushi.

B Bar Centrale 326 W. 46th St., 2nd fl. (bet. 8th & 9th Aves.), 212-581-3130 Above veteran saloon Joe Allen (which owns it) is this new lounge, a cozy corner festooned with faux zebra upholstery and family photos; it's quickly gained a rep among theatrical types – the likes of Lauren Bacall and Bill Nighy have been glimpsed there – so post-show rezzies are recommended.

That's the case with this new industrial-chic lounge, nestled in the New World Stages underground complex (currently home to the long-running Altar Boyz and four other shows).

After several years in the Flatiron District, Kitchen 22, Charlie Palmer's budget-friendly New American, closed today. According to a press release, \"The seating capacity and the limited menu concept no longer fit the direction of growth and development of the company.\" Earlier this month, Palmer announced plans to move his flagship restaurant, Aureole, to the Bank of America Tower at One Bryant Park in spring 2009. He is also heading to the new Bloomingdale's at South Coast Plaza in Orange County, California (3333 Bristol St., Costa Mesa), where he will open a restaurant and wine shop in the fall.

Participating chefs include Dan Barber (Blue Hill), David Chang (Momofuku Noodle Bar, Momofuku Ssäm Bar), Melissa Murphy (Sweet Melissa) and Jean-Georges Vongerichten (Jean Georges, JoJo, Vong). Get in on the bidding at 7:30 PM at Cipriani at 200 Fifth Avenue (cocktails and bites served from 7–11 PM; $250 per person, purchase tickets by June 6th; 646-254-7521; www.frenchculinary.com).

Serving Bellinis again after a two-year hiatus, Harry Cipriani, the haute Venetian in the Sherry-Netherland that's the original NYC spin-off of Harry’s Bar in Venice, has a polished new look and is still attracting enough Euro moguls, retired models and diamond-drenched society dames to make it a people-watching paradise; comically high pricing distracts from the low ceilings and tiny tables, but ultimately the scene is the thing here.

Pinkberry, the California-based frozen-yogurt chain famous for its fresh fruit toppings, has revealed its next NYC location: 41 Spring St. (bet. Mott & Mulberry Sts.). It's due to open by mid-June, which means that Nolita denizens hankering for a taste of its plain or green tea fro-yo will no longer have to make the trek to Chelsea (170 8th Ave.; 212-488-2510), the Garment District (7 W. 32nd St.; 212-695-9631) or – gasp! – the Upper East Side (1577 2nd Ave.; 212-861-0574). There are several more branches in the works throughout the city for the summer.

Downtown's Gilded Age: Little Italy's GoldBar photo: Morten Smidt Manolos have been clacking down Clinton Street for ages now, but what once resembled an illicit affair between Uptown and Down – a stolen glance, a wry smile – is now a full-blown Sunday Times engagement. Last week it was reported that Daniel Boulud – whose Daniel epitomizes East Side swank – was shopping for a restaurant space on Houston Street, across from Whole Foods and adjacent to that newly minted millionaire's stretch, the Bowery. In honor of that momentous announcement, here's a short list of Downtown bistros and boîtes where even Uptown debs will feel at home: Boarding school buddies looking to hook up flock to Nolita's boisterous Bar Martignetti, aka the Downtown Dorrian's. Like the University Club, the Bowery Hotel Bar is about to go private; expect members to head to Gemma, the hotel's soon-to-open Italian eatery on the ground floor. Celebs like Lindsay Lohan slum it at The Box, a plutocrats' playground infamous for its simulated sex shows. At Falai, a former pastry chef at Le Cirque makes the taut-skinned set feel welcome in chic white-on-white surroundings. For those who won't deign to go above 14th Street comes GoldBar, a luxe lounge from the Cain crew.

NYC to Nix Sous Vide Ban?

***CONTENT
Have you ever eaten anything cooked \"sous vide\"? Do you think the technique should be banned? Tell us what you think on the Zagat Discussion boards! Last year, the NYC Health Department banned sous vide cooking in restaurant kitchens, at least until it hashed out regulations. Now it looks like those regulations will finally see the light of day, with guidelines expected to be submitted to the Board of Health within the next few months – which is when they'll become available for public scrutiny before being put to a vote. The embattled technique – French for \"under vacuum\" – consists of cooking vacuum-sealed food at low temperatures and has been widely used by top toques like Thomas Keller and Daniel Boulud. Fans say it increases tenderness and flavor. NY’s health officials fear it might cause food poisoning. Meanwhile, Blue Hill, Cru, Eleven Madison Park, Per Se and wd-50 have all submitted procedures for using the technique that have been approved by the NYC Health Department. And the trend is catching on in San Francisco, where it's being used everywhere from the avant-garde Coi to the old-guard Ritz-Carlton Dining Room.

The Soft Closing

***CONTENT
Soft openings are nothing new in Gotham – restaurants need time to get all the cylinders firing before undergoing the instant judgment of overzealous bloggers and gotta-be-there-first foodies. (The Waverly Inn has taken the concept to its extreme by remaining in soft-opening mode for a full six months now.) The latest wrinkle, however, is the soft closing: places that shut “temporarily” for weeks on end, with their future uncertain at best. Two prime examples are Montrachet (whose phone message has stated “the restaurant will be closed for several weeks” since July 2006) and Brasserie LCB (shuttered since March 2007). Whether they’ll return is anyone’s guess, but the longer they stay closed, the less likely a comeback seems. And it’s not only restaurants that are embracing this trendlet. Two popular nightspots – Siberia and Single Room Occupancy – have also gone “temporarily” dark, with conflicting reports as to whether they’ll ever see the light of the moon again. – Curt Gathje

Worth the Wait

By Sarah Halberstadt In honor of National Waiters and Waitresses Day, ZAGAT.com catches up with 21 Club's Eddie Cordero Even the most well-informed restaurant-goer might not be aware that May 21st is National Waiters and Waitresses Day. In honor of that overlooked holiday, we decided to check in with someone who's been working in the profession since Gerald Ford was President, Apple Computer Company had just been formed and the Ramones were releasing their first album. Meet Eddie Cordero, now in his 31st year as a waiter at Manhattan's fabled 21 Club. After coming to the U.S. from Chile in 1976, Cordero heard through a friend of an opening for busboys at the former speakeasy, and though he had no prior restaurant experience, he decided to try it out. A natural, he was promoted to waiter his first year, and has since been promoted to captain, the highest rank for a server there. We asked Cordero to tell us about the job, how it's changed and what's kept him going. ZS: What has kept you at the 21 Club for so long? EC: One good thing is that the 21 Club has a union. I have been married for 28 years, and it gives you the extra security you need when you have a family. When a restaurant closes, the first people to suffer are the employees, but that won't happen at a place with a union. But that's only part of it. The rest is 21. It's the place itself. It's the people who run it – they're experts and have been around for many years. You can do what you're supposed to do in a professional way, and know that everyone else will too. It's been a good ride. ZS: What's the best part of the job? EC: The people and, of course, the money. ZS: The worst? EC: The hours. I leave the house at 9:30 or 10 in the morning and I know I won't be back until 12:30 or 1 AM. It's something you get used to. Talking to other waiters, you hear them say that they haven't seen their kids grow up and I agree with them 100 percent. I have two daughters, who are 24 and 16. The older one, she finished high school and college and now she's getting married. In the meantime, I'm saying, \"How the hell did it happen so fast?\" So that's the bad part of the business, but again, no regrets. I'm not a millionaire but I can support my family. If you ask me if I've ever seen Seinfeld, or any of those shows that are on at 8 o'clock, I've never seen them, but I don't care. ZS: Do you have any regulars who have been there longer than you? EC: We have regulars that have been coming for over 40 or 50 years. When a regular dies, their family keeps coming. I remember Donald Trump when he was young coming in with his father, and he's still coming here. Richard Nixon's grandson still sits at the table his grandfather used to sit at. Years ago, you could keep your own wine collection in the private cellar. And he is still drinking from President Nixon's private stock of wine. ZS: Who is the most memorable celebrity you have served over the years? EC: I would say King Carlos and Queen Sophia from Spain. More recently Bill Gates. I used to keep a list of names. Liza Minnelli, Julia Roberts, Elton John. I met Paul McCartney when I worked in the main dining room. What I remember is, jeans are not permitted, and Paul came in with jeans and a T-shirt. No tie. But I guess, it's Paul McCartney. ZS: What is the most outrageous request a customer has ever made of you? EC: Once years ago, someone asked me for a hot dog and I said, \"You gotta be kidding me? Why don't you just go around the corner and get one for a buck?\" ZS: Did you do it? EC: Yeah, we got him one. I don't know how much he ended up paying for the hot dog we got him, but I'll tell you it wasn't a buck. ZS: How has the clientele changed? Are people ruder than they used to be? EC: No, but they are demanding, they expect a lot. They expect more than a lot. They expect the best. They see that George Clooney eats here and they want to be treated like George Clooney. And they should be. ZS: What about the menu? Have you seen food trends come and go? EC: Each chef tries out new things. Mike Lomonaco would emphasize the steaks and the chops. Erik Blauberg [introduced] more seafood: fish, crabmeat, lobster. Overall, things are prepared in a more health-conscious way. People are reading labels at home and they want to know what's in their food when they eat out. ZS: Is there anything that hasn't changed at all? EC: The atmosphere is always gonna be the same. You're eating in a room that is not luxurious, with toys hanging off the ceiling, and it's loud. But it's always been loud. 21 has been through major renovations over the years, but the barroom hasn't changed and I hope it doesn't. ZS: Any plans to retire? EC: A lot of people retire and then keep working at 21 part-time. But my wife is going to say, \"That's enough.\" I'm going to be 52 soon. I've got 13 years to go. 21 Club might be around forever, but I won't be.

Harold Dieterle One of the shortcomings of tuning into shows like Top Chef is that you're stuck watching all those dishes when what you really want to be doing is tasting them. Fortunately, now that three former Top Chef contestants (including one winner) are setting up kitchens in NYC, your palate no longer has to take a backseat to Tom Colicchio's. Season one winner Harold Dieterle (pictured) opens Perilla, a New American restaurant in Greenwich Village, today (9 Jones St.; 212-929-6868). The seasonal menu will feature dishes such as roasted local duckling ($27), fiddlehead fern ravioli ($26) and taro-crusted fluke ($25). After a two-and-half-year hiatus, Lola is aiming to reopen in late May in new SoHo digs (15 Watts St.; 212-675-6700). It will showcase a Cajun-Creole menu crafted by season one finalist Dave Martin, plus live jazz and R&B music and Sunday gospel brunch. In June, season two contestant Sam Talbot is scheduled to debut Spitzer's Corner on the Lower East Side (101 Rivington St.); its huge space will feature a menu of American small plates, two bars, late-night hours and, in a nod to its LES roots, floors constructed from wooden pickle barrels. Which Top Chef Contestant's Cooking Would You Like To Sample Most? Tell Us on the Zagat Discussion Boards!

Expect the chef’s prix fixe guided tour of Japanese cuisine to go well beyond the usual tempura, fish and rice. Speaking of restaurant reincarnations, chef Sandro Fioriti has revived Sandro's on the Upper East Side (he opened the original Sandro's on East 59th Street with Tony May in the 1980s). The straightforward Italian menu is served till 2 AM, Monday through Saturday, and is complemented by house-infused grappas in flavors like peperoncino and rosemary. The new address is 306 East 81st Street (212-288-7374).

On May 21st, a branch of Greenwich Village's popular Chocolate Bar is debuting on the third floor of Henri Bendel (712 Fifth Ave.). Unlike the original, the new outpost will feature a full menu of savories and sweets, plus a lineup of wine and champagne. A baroque table overflowing with truffles will tempt shoppers, as will baked goods. And since this is Fifth Avenue, the staff will be attired in trendy Alice + Olivia outfits. Downtown, Park Slope's Cocoa Bar joins the craze for all things chocolate by opening a new cafe on the Lower East Side (21 Clinton St.; 212-677-7417) serving decadent desserts that can be coupled with coffee, wine and beer. Or, in the case of port-infused figs covered in dark chocolate, savored in a single bite.

Housed in the former Atelier space in the Ritz-Carlton Central Park (50 Central Park S.), it will offer a rotating seasonal menu that could change as often as once a month. The breezy, elegant setting will feature paintings of figs, heirloom tomatoes, pomegranates and other market bounty, large windows that open onto the street in classic bistro style, outdoor seating and a separate exterior entrance on Sixth Avenue. Monkey Bar: This Midtown New American, which closed on March 6th, will reopen later this month under the direction of chef Patrica Yeo, who will bring her trademark Asian flair to the menu. Meanwhile, the bar up front is scheduled to open today.

***CONTENT
Marco Pierre White is \"The Devil in the Kitchen.\" Celeb chefs Gordon Ramsay and Anthony Bourdain may be the latest enfants terribles to rock the culinary world, but as Britain's original bad-boy toque, Marco Pierre White would like to set the record straight. His new book, The Devil in the Kitchen: Sex, Pain, Madness and the Making of a Great Chef (Bloomsbury, $24.95), recounts his swift culinary ascent, from his humble beginnings as a kitchen apprentice in a Harrogate hotel to the opening of his lauded London restaurant, Harveys, in 1987. There's also some gossipy bits – find out what a dog did to Gordon Ramsay's head or the effect Mario Batali had on White's sex life – thrown in for good measure. Book tour highlights include: May 8th, San Francisco Chef Chris Cosentino will prepare a four-course dinner inspired by White's cooking at Incanto; White will be on hand to sign books (7–9:30 PM; $190 per couple, includes one book; 415-641-4500; www.incanto.biz). May 11th, Chicago Seasons welcomes White for an author luncheon and book signing that includes a three-course tasting menu paired with wines (11:30 AM–1:30 PM; $65 per person; prepayment required; 312-649-2349; www.fourseasons.com). May 14th, Seattle Ethan Stowell and Jason Stoneburner will host a wine dinner at Union (6 PM; $125 per person, includes a signed copy of the book; 206-838-8000). May 17th, NYC White will discuss his book with chefs Mario Batali and Anthony Bourdain at the Time Warner Center branch of Borders Books and Music (7 PM; free; 10 Columbus Circle; www.bordersstores.com). May 20th, Miami Restaurant critic Gael Greene will sit down for a conversation with White at Books & Books in Coral Gables (6 PM; free; 296 Aragon Ave.; www.booksandbooks.com). May 22nd, Boston At No. 9 Park, Barbara Lynch will host an hors d'oeuvres reception and five-course dinner paired with wines inspired by White's cooking. The guest of honor will be on hand to meet guests and sign books (6:30 PM; $235 per person, includes cocktails, dinner, a copy of the book and all taxes and gratuity; 617-742-9991; www.no9park.com).

Q&A with Doug Sohn, Chicago's Foie Gras Scofflaw

***CONTENT
Doug Sohn defied Chicago's foie gras ban, then paid the price; ZAGAT.com caught up with him after his March 29th court date. By Sarah Halberstadt; from Best of the Buzz At 6:15 AM on Friday, February 16th, Doug Sohn of Hot Doug's Sausage Superstore and Encased Meats Emporium in Chicago updated the daily specials on his Web site to include a Sauternes-and-foie-gras duck sausage for $7. By 10 AM, health department officials were impounding his foie gras, wrapping it in official tape labeled \"do not remove\" and placing it in his deep freeze as evidence. Sohn, an outspoken critic of Chicago's recent ban on foie gras, had received a prior warning, which he framed and hung above his counter, for selling the outlawed duck liver in his restaurant. His second violation resulted in a March 29th court hearing. Do you think foie gras should be illegal? Tell us on the Zagat Discussion boards! Last August, Chicago became the first U.S. city to prohibit the sale of foie gras as a result of claims that force-feeding ducks and geese is inhumane, following a similar move by the state of California, whose ban will go into effect in 2012; European countries such as Italy and Germany have also outlawed its production. We spoke with Sohn the day after his court date – which resulted in a $250 fine – about the ban, a chef's responsibility to animal rights and the future of foie gras. ZS: You have been one of the more outspoken critics of the ban. Why? Sohn: Foie gras is just not that big of a deal. I don't think it's the job of the city council to decide what we can and cannot eat. It's just a big waste of time, energy and resources. There are much more egregious crimes in and out of the food industry. ZS: Foie gras is normally served in the most upscale restaurants. Why do you think Hot Doug's got busted before higher-end establishments? Sohn: At most places it is so expensive that it affects a very small number of people. We sell it for an affordable price, which makes us an easy target and a good story. ZS: Reading descriptions of the force-feeding process is enough to make even the most ardent meat eaters cringe. Have you ever visited or seen footage of a foie gras farm? Sohn: Yes, I've been to foie gras farms, hog and cattle farms and slaughterhouses. The animal production process is not pretty. But the information coming from the animal rights organizations is one-sided. If you go to a place like France, where the production of foie gras is much more artisanal, it's a lot more humane than, say, a hog farm in the U.S. If people saw the way hogs were farmed, they'd probably never eat another pork chop. It's hypocritical to focus on foie gras, to make a distinction between how foie gras is produced and, for example, how eggs are produced. It's an easy target because it's expensive and it's not on a lot of menus. It makes people feel good without having a very large effect on the larger problems of the industry. ZS: By taking foie gras off their menus, chefs like Wolfgang Puck and Charlie Trotter are taking a stand on the responsibility of chefs to regulate what is served in their restaurants. As a restaurant owner, do you set any personal standards for the treatment of the animal products you sell? Sohn: Wolfgang Puck, if he wants to do that, God bless him. I respect them both even if Puck is still serving things like caviar that animal rights organizations have on \"do not eat\" lists. Trotter I respect because he's against foie gras, but he's also against the ban. He thinks people should be able to make their own choices. Look, we eat animals like they are commodities, so it doesn't make sense to be drawing these moral lines. Of course, it's not all dollars and cents. I try to get better products when I can because my major concern is the quality of the food. At the same time, you can't deny that this is a commercial business and there is a cost aspect as well. Organic and free-range products can be prohibitively expensive. ZS: Chicago recently banned smoking inside restaurants and is considering a ban on trans fat. Do you think all of these bans are an infringement on restaurateur and consumer choice? Sohn: The trans fat ban to me is attacking a minor issue. It's a Band-Aid on a much larger problem. If you want to get rid of problems with obesity, then get rid of poverty. Smoking is different. If you want to sit down next to me and eat a big bowl of trans fat, then that's fine with me, because it's not affecting me. But smoking is a different story because it affects other diners and, more importantly, the employees that are exposed to secondhand smoke everyday. ZS: What are you going to do with the impounded foie gras in your freezer? Sohn: Now that we've paid the fine, the health department is going to come and take the sticker off. Once they do that, we're going to throw it away. It's not worth the headache. ZS: Will you continue to sell foie gras in your restaurant? Sohn: No. It's not worth it to risk getting shut down. And more than that, the livelihood of my employees is at stake. If the restaurant closes, they are all out of jobs. ZS: Immediately after receiving the citation you closed Hot Doug's and went on a vacation in France, where a law designating foie gras part of French cultural heritage was recently passed, protecting it from the type of ban Chicago has adopted. Did being in the home of foie gras strengthen your resolve? Sohn: Yes. I ate foie gras like it was legal! ZS: With many countries in Europe, as well as the state of California, banning foie gras, do you think it's inevitable that it will become a dying delicacy in the U.S.? Sohn: That would be too bad. I would spend a lot more time in France.

***CONTENT
Always inventive, sometimes bizarre, molecular gastronomy has redefined \"cutting-edge cuisine.\" So it's no wonder it's making headlines of late. In a joint statement on \"The New Cookery\" published last December in the UK Guardian, Ferran Adria of El Bulli, Heston Blumenthal of The Fat Duck, Thomas Keller of The French Laundry and Per Se, and writer Harold McGee rejected the term, noting, \"We embrace innovation – new ingredients, techniques, appliances, information, and ideas – whenever it can make a real contribution to our cooking. We do not pursue novelty for its own sake.\" Whether you call it molecular gastronomy or not, it's a provocative subject, and one that will be at the center of two events in NYC next week featuring talks by Hervé This, the French food scientist and author of Molecular Gastronomy: Exploring the Science of Flavor. On April 10th, the Institute of Culinary Education will host \"Culinary Constructivism with Hervé This: The Next Culinary Movement,\" with limited seats available to the general public (1–4 PM; $60 per person; 50 W. 23rd St.; 212-847-0700; www.iceculinary.com). The following day, New York University will lead an invitation-only workshop called \"Experimental Cuisine: Science, Society and Food\" in which This will deliver the keynote address. Other speakers include Will Goldfarb of Room 4 Dessert, Wylie Dufresne of wd-50 and Robert F. Margolskee, professor of neuroscience at Mount Sinai School of Medicine.

After a bit of a cold spell, the restaurant scene is beginning to heat up again. Mercat is finally set to debut in Noho (45 Bond St.) the second week of April. Like Boqueria and Casa Mono, it will marry Catalan cooking and a hip setting, to include an open kitchen and a downstairs tapas lounge. On April 12th, Vicki Freeman and Marc Meyer of Five Points and Cookshop are scheduled to reopen Provence, the SoHo perennial that closed in October 2006 after 20 years of business. The new incarnation will feature local, seasonal Provençal cooking from chef-partner Lynn McNeely (formerly of Barbuto). The Zipper Factory Tavern is also slated to open that day in the Garment District (336 W. 37th St.; 212-695-4600), where it replaces Camino Sur and will serve gourmet pub fare like homemade charcuterie and a cheese steak made with sliced top sirloin and fontina fondue. On April 16th, Hearth chef Marco Canora will open Insieme in The Michelangelo hotel (152 W. 51st St.). It means \"together\" in Italian, a nod to the old-world-meets-new-world menu, in which fairly straightforward preparations will sit side by side with more experimental dishes merging Italian cooking techniques with seasonal, less traditional ingredients. The week of the 16th should see two other (oddly punctuated) openings: Pastry chef Pichet Ong (Spice Market) will strike out on his own with P*ONG, a sweet-and-savory West Village dessert bar (150 W. 10th St.) in the vein of ChikaLicious and Room 4 Dessert, while Didier Virot is opening FR.OG across the street from Balthazar. The name is short for \"French Origin,\" the common influence that will be felt in all of the ex Aix chef's global dishes. Finally, mid-April should the see the openings of Centro Vinoteca, a modern Italian restaurant from Gusto owner Sasha Muniak at 74 Seventh Ave. S., as well as the Cobble Hill branch of Pó, Stephen Crane's Greenwich Village Italian classic, at 270 Smith Street in Brooklyn.

His replacement is Jansen Chan, an alum of Alain Ducasse at the Essex House. View the New Menu

By Randi Gollin, ZAGAT.com staff editor Save a bundle on basics, splurge on something naughty then celebrate your shopping smarts at SoHo's newest wine bars, bistros and hot-ticket hangouts. Related Stories Explore Other Hot Blocks Forget that old \"shop till you drop\" mantra. Whether you're a born-and-bred New Yorker or an intrepid out-of-towner, most likely you don't have the time or energy for a citywide browse-a-thon. One way to get a bead on what's happening: focus on one neighborhood at a clip. Shop and bop till you're hungry and thirsty then shop some more! The go-to zone right now? That old shopping chestnut: SoHo. So slip into something comfortable, wave hello to old friends like Barneys CO-OP and Kirna Zabête then explore the latest crop of hot shops. Whether you blanket the area or stick to one pocket you're bound to unearth a fresh favorite. After indulging in that I-deserve-this purchase, kick back at one of the latest entrants to the restaurant/bar scene – some set squarely in SoHo, others steps away on the edge of Little Italy and NoLita (close to still-sizzling La Esquina) – or carry on till morning at an ultracool hotel in SoHo or nearby TriBeCa. Here then a day-into-night (or day-into-next-day) itinerary to guide you to some of SoHo's most notable newcomers. (Note: We've also included a few soon-to-open places to file away for future reference.)

Several hotels are in the works, including Donald Trump Jr.'s controversial condo-hotel high-rise that will tower over western SoHo and most likely house yet another BLT restaurant. And come May, hipsters will hotfoot it to Robert DeNiro's high-profile, six-story TriBeCa sleeperie, which will also be home to a New York version of Ago, his hot-spot Tuscan with outposts in West Hollywood and South Beach.

Ooh la la! A new lunchtime \"Menu Express\" at L'Atelier de Joël Robuchon means the sky-high tabs are a now little easier to swallow. Sample three courses from a weekly changing roster of five appetizers, five entrees and five desserts, from \"Le King Crab\" to \"Le Pamplemousse,\" for $48 (212-350-6658). You've got a (slightly) better chance of gaining entry into Keith McNally's new hot spot Morandi now that it's serving lunch (noon–3 PM), in addition to weekday breakfast (8–11:30 AM) and weekend brunch (10 AM–4 PM). Likewise, the Downtown artist set can now adjourn to LES hipster haven Freemans for afternoon tête-à-têtes. Back in midtown, Aquavit is serving a $39 three-course lunch in the main dining room; the menu is available Monday through Saturday and features entree choices such as hot smoked trout and grilled hanger steak. A $20 cafe menu is also available. Over on the west side, Gray Kunz has put a halt to lunch service at his Café Gray.

For more details, see Zagat Stats at right. Meanwhile, Black Pearl, which first established its name as a take-out window in the rear of a divey East Village bar, is now hawking its famed lobster rolls in full-fledged Chelsea digs.

From Best of the Buzz Wolfgang Puck Photo by Alex Berliner In response to three years of protests from a group called Farm Sanctuary, Wolfgang Puck has joined with the Humane Society in a campaign to fight animal cruelty at his 15 high-profile restaurants (Spago, Chinois on Main, etc.), as well as within his catering and frozen food empire. What this means is wiener schnitzel made from free-range veal, eggs from cage-free chickens, lobsters not kept in holding tanks for long periods and an end to foie gras (seared or otherwise). Because of increased food costs, prices at his restaurants will rise $1 to $2 per item, Puck says. What Do You Think of All This? Tell Us on the Zagat Discussion Boards!

By Liz Borod Wright, ZAGAT.com staff editor Resorts and Hotels Offer Culinary Activities To Help Guests Make the Most of Their Getaway Would you want to take cooking classes at a resort for your next vacation? Share your plans on the Zagat Discussion boards! For most people, going on vacation means taking a break from the kitchen. But for some, the opportunity to cook can be an important element of a getaway, allowing them to add to their recipe repertoire, increase their understanding of another culture's cuisine – or just indulge in an enjoyable activity they don't have much time for back home. To that end, an increasing number of hotels are offering things like cooking classes at their restaurants (examples include Azul in Miami's Mandarin Oriental and Wave in Chicago's W Lakeshore), tours geared for foodies (like The Fairmont Royal York's tour of St. Lawrence Market in Toronto) and special packages for culinary-minded travelers. Hungry for a vacation that really cooks? Here's a list of options. U.S. California Meadowood Napa Valley 900 Meadowood Ln., St. Helena, CA, 800-458-8080 Restaurant at Meadowood Those seeking more in-depth knowledge about wine than can be garnered during a casual Napa Valley wine tasting will appreciate Meadowood's \"Mealtime Food and Wine Pairing\" with Gilles de Chambure, master sommelier and the resort's director of wine education. De Chambure guides his students through the meal as he explains how the wines selected enhance the flavor of the dish and how the flavors in the dish enhance the enjoyment of the wine. Cost: For lunch, a three-course meal with wine pairings at the Meadowood Grill is $150 per person. For dinner, a four-course meal with wine pairings at the Restaurant at Meadowood is $250 person. Room rates start at $475 per night during low season. Florida Mandarin Oriental 500 Brickell Key Dr., Miami, FL, 866-888-6780 Host of the South Beach Wine and Food Festival, Miami has become a hot culinary destination. Improve your own culinary skills at Azul, the Mandarin Oriental's Med-Asian, which is offering hands-on cooking classes with chef Clay Conley in its open kitchen. The classes will be held from 9:30 AM–1 PM on the following Saturdays: \"Gone Fishing\" on April 21st; \"Vegetarian Cooking\" on May 19th; \"For Dads\" (favorite football tailgating recipes) on June 9th; \"Mix and Mingle\" (cocktail party tips) on September 15th; and \"Festive Ways to Prepare for the Holidays\" on October 20th. Cost: Each class costs $175 per person, which includes a three-course lunch paired with wine, and a signature Azul apron. The Mandarin Oriental also offers these classes as a part of its \"Weekend of Culinary Delights\" package for two, which includes accommodations for Friday and Saturday nights, breakfast daily, a cooking class, a private meeting with chef Conley to choose your evening's dinner menu, a three-course dinner at Azul and a specially engraved culinary tool. Based on double occupancy, the package costs from $1,789 for classes held on April 21st, from $1,649 for May 19th and October 20th and from $1,389 for June 9th and September 15th. Georgia Jekyll Island Club Hotel 371 Riverview Dr., Jekyll Island, GA, 800-535-9547 Crane Cottage at Jekyll Island Club Hotel From August 26th–30th, this former hunting-retreat-turned-resort transforms one of its mansions, Crane Cottage, into a cooking school. The Jekyll Island Club Hotel sends out questionnaires to the participants to find out their skill level and interests, and then plans the menu accordingly. The Courtyard at Crane's restaurant closes temporarily so the students can work in the kitchen. Classes are held in the mornings, from 8 AM–1 PM, so students can enjoy everything the resort has to offer – golf, beach, oak forest and more – in the afternoons. Cost: The package, which costs $1,299 per couple and $899 per single, includes superior accommodations in Crane Cottage for four nights, all cooking classes, chef jackets with the hotel logo, breakfast daily, a welcome reception Sunday evening followed by a dinner, dancing and entertainment in the Grand Dining Room, wine tasting with the hotel's sommelier and a farewell dinner on Wednesday evening. Illinois W Lakeshore 644 N. Lake Shore Dr., Chicago, IL, 877-946-8357 Wave at the W Lakeshore Get an insider's view of Chicago's hip restaurant scene by taking a class at W Lakeshore's Wave, a small-plates Mediterranean restaurant. Chef Kristine Subido's new monthly \"Global Kitchen\" cooking class on the second Saturday afternoon (2:30–4:30 PM) of each month explores flavors and spices from various world destinations, beginning with a theme cocktail followed by a cooking demo and dinner with the chef at a festively decorated communal table. April is Spain, May is Philippines and June is Provence. After the class, you can reward yourself for a job well done at the W Lakeshore's Bliss Spa. Cost: Each class is $35 per person and includes instructions, gift bag, cocktails and food. The W offers a special room rate starting at $199 per night for guests taking the class. To book, call the reservations number at 1-877-822-0000 and request the COOK rate at W Chicago-Lakeshore. New Hampshire The Manor on Golden Pond Squam Lake, Rte. 3, Holderness, NH, 603-968-3348 This romantic New England inn set in a century-old English manor house overlooking Squam Lake offers \"Fork in the Road Cooking Classes,\" which are weekend-long epicurean escapes that begin with dinner on Friday night. Guests attend cooking classes on both Saturday and Sunday mornings. \"Lobster and Ginger Fused\" is scheduled for the weekend of April 20th, when participants will make lobster potstickers, lemongrass-and-ginger-crusted sea bass, lobster risotto and ginger crème brûlée. For the weekend of May 18th, students will make shrimp-and-plantain lollipops, shrimp scampi and banana Bacardi cheesecake as part of \"Shrimp Gone Bananas.\" There will be more cooking weekends scheduled for later in the summer, so check in with the hotel if you're interested. Cost: Packages range from $600 to $1,050, depending on the room booked, and includes two nights' accommodations and all meals for two, cooking classes for one ($75 additional for the second person), a recipe book and a surprise gift. New Mexico Inn on the Alameda 303 E. Alameda, Santa Fe, NM, 888-984-2121 With its hot tubs, courtyards and proximity to Santa Fe's art galleries, it's easy to overlook one of the great perks of the Inn on the Alameda: its partnership with the Santa Fe School of Cooking. The inn regularly offers its Muy Sabrosa Cooking School packages (\"muy sabrosa\" means very tasty) that allow you to take advantage of the school and learn the secrets of Southwestern cuisine. Cost: The package includes two nights' accommodations, a two-and-a-half-hour cooking class and lunch for two at the Santa Fe School of Cooking, breakfast daily, afternoon wine and cheese reception daily and 20% off at Ristra restaurant. The price for two people ranges from $320 to $648 according to the time of year and type of room booked.

No Labeling Loophole for Wendy's

What do you think about the new law? Do you think the new law requiring fast food restaurants to put calorie information on their menus is justified or makes sense? Tell us on the Zagat Discussion boards! Wendy's will reportedly not be exempt from a new local law requiring NYC restaurants to put calorie information on menus in the same font size as product names and prices – despite the fast-fooder's apparent attempt to dodge the rules, which only apply to eateries posting calorie information on or after March 1st. Prior to that date, Wendy's removed such stats from nutritional posters in its local outlets and posted a note on its Web site stating the info was no longer available to NYC consumers. However, White Castle, which yanked nutritional info across its operations, appears to have skirted the law by casting a wider net. The new law goes into effect in July.

Humans Top Rats as Health Threats?

***CONTENT
Health Codes 101 Obviously, the enforcement of health codes raises serious and complex issues. However, we invite comment from restaurateurs who must live with these regulations and are presumably most informed on the Zagat Discussion boards. Rats have been hogging the spotlight when it comes to restaurant health-code violations lately – dozens of the rodents were caught on video carousing after-hours in a Greenwich Village KFC/Taco Bell recently (just a day after the fast-fooder passed a health inspection), prompting NYC officials to launch a crackdown that led to more than 80 eateries being shut down for a variety of health-code violations – but they may not pose as big a threat to diners' health as employees who fail to wash their hands. According to the health department, \"While rats are not generally associated with health issues, their presence in restaurants suggests unacceptable unsanitary conditions. By comparison, food kept at an improper temperature and poor personal hygiene, such as not washing hands, puts customers at much greater risk of foodborne illness.\" Meanwhile, at least a couple of the shuttered NYC restaurants, including Union Square's popular Coffee Shop and the famed John's Pizzeria on Bleecker Street, have since reopened.

Morandi photo: Noah Kalina Hitmaker Keith McNally does Italian for the first time at his much-anticipated new Village trattoria, Morandi. NYC’s latest dining trend, the intimate ‘inn’, lands in the rollicking Meatpacking District via Inn LW12, a Canadian/British gastropub with Daniel Boulud as a consultant. Speaking of gastropubs, the phenomenon crosses the pond – and the East River – into Brooklyn with the arrival of Alchemy, a New American tavern housed in an old hardware shop on Park Slope’s Fifth Avenue. Meanwhile, Amalia is carved out of a former carriage house adjacent to Midtown’s Dream Hotel and exudes downtown cool with its distressed brick walls, black chandeliers and industrial-chic basement.

Coming Soon: Ago, Insieme and More

Ago: This Robert DeNiro–backed Tuscan hot spot, with locations in West Hollywood and South Beach, is opening an outpost in TriBeCa's forthcoming Downtown Hotel – a six-story luxury property at Greenwich and North Moore streets – in May. Bar Boulud: Daniel Boulud's Upper West Side wine bar (1900 Broadway) now has a name, and its simplicity belies its serious food-and-wine program (even if it is casual by Boulud standards). The cellar will boast some 500 wines, and \"reverse pairings\" will match the Burgundy-heavy list with a New French menu showcasing homemade artisanal charcuterie. Look for a September 2007 debut. BLT Market: Laurent Tourondel's latest NYC location is still on track for a spring opening, likely in May. Housed in the former Atelier space in the Ritz-Carlton Central Park (50 Central Park S.), it will offer a rotating seasonal menu that could change as often as once a month. The breezy, elegant setting will feature paintings of figs, heirloom tomatoes, pomegranates and other market bounty, large windows that open onto the street in classic bistro style, outdoor seating and a separate exterior entrance on Sixth Avenue. Insieme: In other naming news, Hearth chef Marco Canora has settled on a sobriquet – it means \"together\" in Italian – for his forthcoming project in The Michelangelo hotel (152 W. 51st St.). It's a nod to the old-world-meets-new-world menu, in which fairly straightforward preparations will sit side by side with more experimental dishes merging Italian cooking techniques with seasonal, less traditional ingredients. The opening is now scheduled for April. Mercat: Like Boqueria and Casa Mono, this newcomer will marry Catalan cooking and a hip setting, to include an open kitchen and a downstairs tapas lounge; it's set to debut in Noho (45 Bond St.) in mid-March. Southern Hospitality: Justin Timberlake is reportedly opening this BBQ restaurant on the Upper East Side. B.R. Guest Restaurants confirms it has taken over the former Park Avenue Country Club space (381 Park Avenue S.) a few doors up from Dos Caminos, where it plans to install a steakhouse in fall 2007. The deal to open Park Chinois with London restaurateur Alan Yau having fallen through, Ian Schrager is now negotiating with chef Yuji Wakiya of Tokyo's Wakiya Ichiemicharo to partner on an upscale Chinese restaurant in his Gramercy Hotel (2 Lexington Ave.).

Russian Tea Room Star chef Gary Robins is no longer in the kitchen of this Russian revivalist. Photo: Lauren Krohn Boathouse: The outdoor patio of this Central Park oasis is reopening for the warm-weather season on April 15th; new additions include an outdoor grill and live music in the evenings. Bouley: In the fall, David Bouley will move his flagship restaurant across the street to 161 Duane Street. At that time, the 120 W. Broadway space will become Bouley Bakery and, over at the current Bouley Bakery & Market space at 130 W. Broadway, his Upstairs eatery will expand to include the ground floor. Cité & Cité Grill: Both of these Midtown eateries will permanently close on April 2nd. 15 East: Marco Moreira's Japanese restaurant in the old Tocqueville space debuted in December with just a sushi bar; now, a cooked menu is also available, including the likes of prawn tempura ($18), wild salmon three ways ($26) and sirloin of Colorado Kobe beef ($45). Gramercy Tavern: Chef Mike Anthony's new menu includes signature dishes such as suckling pig and flat-iron steak with short-rib ravioli ($76 for three courses). Kobe Club: In protest of his recent zero-star New York Times review, restaurateur Jeffrey Chodorow took out a full-page Times ad on February 21st lambasting critic Frank Bruni; Chodorow has since launched a blog to swipe back at Gotham restaurant critics. London Bar: A prix fixe menu is now available at Gordon Ramsay's small-plates eatery; the two- and three-course menus ($25 and $31, respectively) include choices such as chicken liver and foie gras parfait and risotto of sweet corn and basil, served from 11 AM–6:30 PM daily. Miriam: A new Cobble Hill branch of this Park Slope Israeli-Med has opened at 229 Court Street, where it boasts a full liquor license and bar, as well as weekday breakfast and weekend brunch hours. Patina Restaurant Group: Through March 11th, purchase any bottle of red wine and receive 25 percent off and a \"Pocket Guide to Wine\" from Wine Enthusiast Magazine; the \"Savor the Reds\" offer is available at all Patina Restaurant Group restaurants, including Brasserie 8 1/2 and Sea Grill. Russian Tea Room: Star chef Gary Robins is no longer in the kitchen of this Russian revivalist, which recently began serving weekday breakfast and lunch, as well as weekend brunch. Shorty's: The Philly cheese steak specialist formerly known as Tony Luke's now goes by this new name. Smith & Wollensky: Smith & Wollensky Group Inc. will merge with Patina Restaurant Group (Patina, Sea Grill, etc.) as part of a $79.5 million deal that will leave the steakhouse chain's six NYC restaurants – including Park Avenue Cafe and Quality Meats – in the hands of founder Alan Stillman. Patina says it will expand the Smith & Wollensky brand outside of NYC. Earlier this year, the Texas-based Landry's Restaurants Inc. (owner of the Chart House and Rainforest Cafe chains, among others) had launched a hostile takeover bid of the steakhouse chain. Strip House: Speaking of steakhouses – on Sundays, this voluptuous West Villager takes 20 percent off roughly a dozen bottles on its wine list.

By ZAGAT.com staff editors Notable performances by restaurants in a variety of categories, from nuttiest name to kookiest concept Related Stories Locations, Locations, Locations Call it a case of Oscar fever: now that awards season is in full swing, we thought it was time to shine the spotlight on some notable performances by restaurants in a variety of categories (all highly subjective and wide open to debate). After all, why let the Academy have all the fun? And the winners are... Don't agree with us? Nominate your own winners on the Zagat Discussion boards! Copenhagen's TyvenKokkenHansKone- OgHendesElsker Nuttiest Name These days, restaurateurs seem to pay as much attention to what's on the marquee as what's on the plate. Naming trends range from the in-dire-need-of-a-copy-editor category (brgr, STK, Pre:Post) to the why-the-heck-did-they-call-it-that department (Feelings Cafe, Food Amongst the Flowers, Stumbling Goat). For sheer comic effect, though, it can be hard to top the impact in English of certain foreign names, like Muy Dung in Japan and – our fave – Copenhagen's head-spinning TyvenKokkenHansKoneOgHendesElsker. Named after the film The Cook, the Thief, His Wife & Her Lover, it strings together 33 consonants (nine more than the Greek alphabet!). Most Eye-Catching Decor Restaurateurs routinely spend millions trying to outdo each other in the decor department, turning dining rooms into ever more elaborate stage sets – 2,000 samurai swords are suspended from the ceiling at NYC's new Kobe Club and Chicago's recently debuted DeLaCosta is outfitted with a \"solarium\" lounge, as well as five private cabanas. But Moscow's Shinok may have them all beat. This 24-hour Ukrainian eatery features a glassed-in faux farmhouse in its center filled with live domestic animals – cows, hens, horses – tended to by a lady who sits and knits (shades of Madame Defarge) when not otherwise occupied with her charges. The animals are there for visual interest only so Bessie won't eventually wind up on your dinner plate. If that's not distraction enough, a clown is on hand to amuse children on weekends. Now that's entertainment! The \"bedroom\" at LA's Aphrodisiac Kookiest Concept It's a restaurant... It's a hotel... It's a movie set... Somehow, Aphrodisiac in Los Angeles manages to offer the experience of all three. For $395 (including tax and tip), you and your date get an eight-course meal with eight wine pairings served in the \"bedroom,\" a small chamber complete with a mirror, king-size bed covered with a crimson velvet spread, and – what else? – a video camera. Also included: your own private butler and an unedited DVD of your three-hour experience. What's on the DVD, we don't want to know. Most Counter-Intuitive Fee Surprising surcharges aren't uncommon in the restaurant world but how about being charged for failing to clean your plate? At Yuka, a popular New York City sushi specialist, opt for the $18.95 all-you-can-eat deal and you'll be charged an extra $1 for every piece of sushi you fail to consume (and double that for every leftover roll). But hey, at least you're not asked to leave, which surveyors say has been among the clean-your-plate strategies used by Spirite Lounge, a vegan eatery in Montreal. L'Arpège in Paris photo: Aurore Deligny Priciest Prix Fixe For big-spender bragging rights in the U.S. it's hard to beat Masa, the Japanese superstar in New York City's Time Warner Center that charges a whopping $400 for five courses (and there's no à la carte escape route). Your bill can climb even higher if you opt for one of the sometimes-available supplements like Kobe beef. Of course, you can find even steeper options across the pond thanks to the current exchange rate. At haute cuisine haven L'Arpège in Paris, the six-course prix fixe served in spring, summer and fall will set you back 340 euros, or roughly $446. And its current winter truffle menu is priced at 420 euros, or about $551. Tastiest Trend In what may be the most notable marriage of high and low since Rick Bayless teamed up with Burger King, restaurants around the country are introducing gourmet spins on junk food. You may not be able to get a foie gras burger in Chicago anymore, but you can console yourself with Tavern's $11 potato chips (they're sprinkled with three flavors of tobiko – wasabi, ginger and tabasco – plus onions and crème fraîche), or, if you're really feeling down in the dumps, a $100 Beluga caviar–topped pizza at Barcello's. In DC, Charlie Palmer Steak offers gourmet riffs on street food classics, including a lobster corn dog ($9) served at the bar. And over in LA, the new Oinkster serves \"slow fast food\" like house-cured pastrami with Gruyère cheese, caramelized onion and red cabbage slaw ($8.50). The FleurBurger 5000 at Las Vegas' Fleur de Lys Biggest-Bucks Burger Blame it on Daniel Boulud. Back in 2001, the celebrated chef debuted a short rib–, foie gras– and preserved truffle–stuffed sirloin patty at db Bistro Moderne for the then-jaw-dropping price tag of $26 (it's now $32). Others are following suit: NYC's new BLT Burger hawks a $62 Japanese Kobe beef variety. But short of a gold-plated patty, it's hard to imagine how anyone could one-up the FleurBurger 5000 – as in $5,000 – served at Mandalay Bay's Fleur de Lys. It matches the competition in choice ingredients (truffles, foie gras, Japanese Kobe), then amps the luxe factor by throwing in a bottle of 1990 Chateau Petrus poured in Ichendorf Brunello stemware (the crystal is later shipped to your home). According to a restaurant manager, two were once sold at the same table, though it's usually the casino that foots the bill for high rollers. Low rollers can always console themselves at the nearest In-N-Out. Toughest Reservations Sure, it's not easy to snag one of the 15 tables at per se, Thomas Keller's NYC standout, but there's no special trick involved in trying: just call the listed number and book (for months out, if necessary). But at other tough tickets, it's not quite as straightforward: Chef Vola's in Atlantic City, for example, assigns reservations for the whole year at the beginning of the year, and if you're not a regular or friendly with the owner, Louise Esposito, good luck. At NYC's Waverly Inn, calling the listed number gets you a recording saying that the restaurant is opening in the fall – despite the fact that it's been serving boldface-named friends of co-owner Graydon Carter since mid-November. There is a secret phone number for bookings, but mere mortals who don't have it can either take a shot at getting a walk-in table or make reservations in person.

By Olga Boikess Hospitality pros weigh in on what diners can do to get five-star treatment Related Stories You Want What With That? Sure, the food has to be good, but as every diner knows, hospitality is the name of the game for restaurateurs aiming to stand out from the crowd and deliver a truly rave-worthy experience. What you might not realize, however, is that the customer can have a lot of influence over the quality of the service. Dining out is like \"a dance – you [the customer] have to be a partner,\" observes Patrick O'Connell, owner of the legendary Inn at Little Washington, rated No. 1 for Service in our most recent DC-area Survey. We asked O'Connell and four other restaurateurs well-schooled in the art of hospitality – Kevin Brown, president of Chicago-based Lettuce Entertain You Enterprises (which operates the likes of Ambria, Everest and Tru, among others); Richard Drapkin, a partner in Los Angeles' hyper-busy Grace and BLD; Danny Meyer, founder of some of NYC's most popular dining rooms including Gramercy Tavern and Union Square Cafe (and author of Setting the Table: The Transforming Power of Hospitality in Business); and Christopher Myers, owner-host of Boston's Radius, Great Bay and Via Matta – for their advice on what diners can do to hold up their end of the service dance. Do you have a tip on how to get great service? Share it on the Zagat Discussion boards! Kevin Brown ZS: What are the most important things a customer can do to get the best service? Meyer: \"Realize that we will make unintentional mistakes... Judge us by the spirit of hospitality with which we overcome that mistake and be direct about bringing it to our attention in a timely fashion.\" Drapkin: \"Let us know exactly what you want – [preferably] before you walk in the door. Tell the reservationist if it's business, a birthday, a family function.\" Myers: \"Do your homework. Check out the Web site. Look at menus. Say 'we're going to the theater – can we order ahead?' Ask in a gracious way: 'Is that possible?'\" Brown: \"Explain and articulate your needs so that we know what you want. How not to get great service? Be curt, adversarial or abusive.\" O'Connell: \"Smile. Make a connection. Tell someone how much you are looking forward to the meal. Have some trust; most people [in the business] are trying to make you happy.\" Richard Drapkin ZS: Suppose a problem occurs but the customer is hosting important clients or relatives and doesn't want to make a fuss or make guests uncomfortable. What should he or she do? Can a manager rescue the situation without alerting guests? Brown: \"In a busy place, the manager can't always keep an eye on the timing of every table...the kitchen can be overwhelmed. If the [customer] goes directly to the manager, he can expedite – or reprioritize the kitchen.\" O'Connell: \"Excuse yourself from the table... Be very clear about what isn't working and say what you want to happen – [to switch staff, say] 'it's not the right chemistry.'\" Myers: \"An intuitive server alerts the manager who can ask the [customer] to leave the table 'to take a call.'... [Or the host can simply] call the server over and say 'we didn't mention that we need to be at the airport in 45 minutes.'\" Meyer: \"It's not a big deal to bring up a problem in front of guests – be direct: 'My guest ordered steak medium rare and wondered if you would do another one for her.'\" Drapkin: \"A squeaky wheel will get attention but not by acting angry, whistling, clicking fingers, standing up. Be gracious and go to a person who can accomplish [the desired result].\" Danny Meyer photo: Michael Weschler Photography ZS: If you know you have certain needs that may be difficult to meet – you have allergies, you're a picky eater, drafts and noise bother you a lot – what can you do to get the servers on your side from the start? Myers: \"Get involved in a genuine exchange. [And] be open to several ways to fix something – 'do you folks have a wrap [if it's chilly]?'\" Drapkin: \"Let the restaurant know [your needs] before you walk in the door. LA is a health-conscious city – [allergies and special food requests] happen all the time. Be straightforward – 'I am allergic to X, Y, Z.'\" Brown: \"People don't need an excuse to express what they want to order. There's no need to hide behind [an allergy].\" O'Connell: \"Let [the staff] know you can be pleased. If there's a certain table where you got engaged but others are seated there – maybe the restaurant can give you the table for dessert when the other diners leave.\" Christopher Myers ZS: On the subject of tipping – who should be tipped and when? What about all those old movies where the guy slips the maitre d' or bartender a bill on arrival – is that still happening? With what results? Drapkin: \"[Slipping a manager a bill] does happen and will get their attention. [But] if you are paying dollars up front to get the best service, you're in the wrong place. Patrons should never have to tip management for service.\" Meyer: \"One tip for the restaurant staff [is the norm]. Exchange business cards with the manager – tell him 'I'd like to call you when I want to return to the restaurant.' Small gifts [to the manager] if you are a regular at a restaurant [can also be appropriate].\" Brown: \"You can pre-tip the staff [ahead of an important event]. You never want to be bribing but saying thank you, acknowledging good service.\" Myers: \"If a manager always seems to do something for you [you can tip him but] a thank-you card is best.\" O'Connell: \"The era of establishing clout with extravagant tips is behind us. An easier way to get what you want is to demonstrate flexibility. [For example,] promise to eat quickly and give the table 'back' in time for a later reservation.\" Patrick O'Connell ZS: What is your pet peeve in terms of customer behavior? Meyer: \"Not saying what you need when you need it in a direct, nonconfrontational manner.\" O'Connell: \"Not telling us in advance about dietary needs or restrictions – [last-minute instructions] can stretch a restaurant on a really busy night.\" Drapkin: \"No consideration of others. Loud, boisterous [behavior]. Treating a reservation as a license to spend the evening [when there's a] large number of people waiting at the bar.\" Myers: \"Never giving us a chance – not saying anything about [a mistake] and then saying the service is no good.\" Brown: \"How, on occasion, rude a guest can be. If [their] language crosses the line, the conversation is ended on the spot.\"

By Yoji Yamaguchi, with additional reporting by Robert Seixas Not every restaurateur believes the customer is always right; we check in to find out why Not every restaurateur subscribes to \"the customer is always right\" school of hospitality. Just think of Seinfeld's Soup Nazi. Or the real-life versions you've encountered who dazzle in the kitchen but frazzle in the dining room with arcane rules, picky policies and other seemingly user-unfriendly quirks. Related Stories How to Get Great Service While we get plenty of complaints from survey participants about \"grumpy,\" \"abrasive\" or downright \"wacky\" chefs and owners, we decided to get the view from the other side of the kitchen door by touching base with restaurateurs known for their rather iconoclastic approach to customer relations. Ezra Cohen of NYC's Azuri Cafe photo: Yoji Yamaguchi Azuri Cafe, NYC Fans say that \"excellent\" \"cheap eats\" make up for any lack of coddling at this tiny Hell's Kitchen Israeli, which earned the lowest Service score (8 on a 0 to 30 scale) in our 2007 New York City Restaurant Survey. \"Every day, all kinds of things make me crazy,\" laments owner Ezra Cohen, whose approach to service is nothing if not straightforward: \"I give them good food. That's it.\" You'd think that might be enough for thick-skinned New York foodies, but apparently not. People, he sighs, \"expect me to be nice 24 hours a day. Smiling. So I have to be nice to them.\" He adds, \"it doesn't happen all the time, though.\" Brett's Café Americain, Chicago The \"delightful\" brunch and \"irresistible\" \"homemade breads and jams\" earn high praise at this New American in Chicago's Roscoe Village, but some surveyors cite a less-than-serene attitude. \"Brunch is a madhouse – like Disneyland at rush hour,\" says chef-owner Brett Knobel. Because it's not a high-ticket meal and the cafe is small, she needs to turn tables regularly to make it profitable. Yet some diners, she says, \"think they're at Starbucks and linger eight hours over an $8 meal.\" Worse, in her eyes, are people who loiter when there are lines out the door. \"The insensitivity of some people to their fellow diners drives me out of my mind,\" she fumes. \"It's like 'I got mine, Jack.'\" To those wont to plow through Remembrance of Things Past during a meal, she advises: \"Come for dinner or lunch, when it's more relaxed.\" Father's Office, Los Angeles \"Just try and get a substitution, ha ha,\" say patrons who've been thwarted in their attempts to sway the \"burger Nazis\" at this thriving Santa Monica gastropub, where no modifications are permitted to anything on the menu and ketchup is verboten on the \"legendary\" burgers featuring dry-aged beef, bacon compote, blue cheese and caramelized onion. Owner Sang Yoon does not see himself as a patty dictator. \"We're not forcing anyone to eat our burger,\" he notes. \"Nor are we taking away anybody's right to choose. There's still McDonald's. In fact, we're offering another choice.\" And contrary to popular opinion, he has nothing against ketchup. \"Most hamburgers need [it],\" he says, \"but mine doesn't. We're confident in our product and not about to change.\" He gripes about what he calls \"fearful\" diners who only \"want what they know,\" and urges them to \"come with an open mind and take our advice.\" \"Face it,\" he adds wryly, \"most people can't cook. Letting them build their own burger is like asking them to build their own car.\" Geno's Steaks, Philadelphia A \"true piece of Americana\" in South Philly, this cheese steak specialist entered the national spotlight thanks to a sign posted next to its take-out window declaring 'This is America. When ordering speak English.' It also earned owner Joey Vento a discrimination complaint from the city's Commission on Human Relations. Despite the citation, the sign remains, and fans still \"wait in line\" for the \"sloppy goodness\" of his signature sandwiches. The grandson of Italian immigrants, Vento insists his sign is just business: \"We have long lines, and don't have time to sit around and negotiate every aspect of ordering a cheese steak. If you don't speak English, we can misinterpret your order.\" He bristles at charges of bias, complaining the \"media made this into a Spanish thing,\" but he says, \"it makes no difference what your native language is.\" Still, he is bemused by the attention. \"Crime in Philly is up, and you're criticizing Joe Vento for saying you have to learn two words, 'cheese steak'? It's two words. We're not asking anyone to recite the Declaration of Independence. You're going to come here and tell me you can't even say 'cheese steak'?\" Prose, Boston Diners have kind words for the fresh, seasonal creations at Deborah Shore's New American bistro in the Boston suburb of Arlington, but according to some you'll either \"love or hate\" the \"leisurely\" pace and \"droll\" ambiance. Running an almost one-woman show, Shore concedes that \"people who dine out a lot are used to a certain level of constant attention and quick service,\" and she'll go so far as to warn people at the door when she's busy. Her one wish is that \"when you can't accommodate customers they'd understand it's not personal. When a place is really small – and even if it isn't – you can only do so much to please them.\" Still, she says she's resigned to the fact that \"most people are clueless about what it takes to run a small business.\" Sushi Nozawa, Los Angeles \"Sit down, shut up and eat\" at Kazunori Nozawa's Studio City sushi temple where a sign announces the house special: 'Trust Me' (the literal translation of omakase, or chef's menu), which, to many, sounds more like an edict than a suggestion. \"Purists\" praise his \"passion for perfection,\" but his \"dictatorial\" style is \"not everyone's cup of sake.\" Nozawa's wife, Yukiko, who also manages the restaurant, spoke to us on his behalf, explaining his English is limited. One word he has no problem with, however, is 'out.' According to Mrs. N., the easiest way to offend the master is to \"confuse American sushi for Japanese.\" When people ask for such things as mayo on tuna, \"he kicks them out,\" she says with some pride. Nozawa was \"taught by many masters\" in his native Japan and is so traditional that any request for what she calls \"new wave–style\" sushi is grounds for expulsion. Complaining to the chef is another surefire exit strategy. And, since the mini-mall space is \"very tiny,\" she says, \"people who bother other customers\" (read: cell phones) are also asking for a sudden sayonara. Regulars, she notes, \"never commit these offenses. They know better.\"

By Carla Spartos and Kelly Stewart, ZAGAT.com staff editors Restaurant industry insiders weigh in on what they'd like to see more of – and less of – in the New Year See What the Pros are Saying: We Need More We Could Do With Less Bring on the bone marrow. Ditto actors who can act like waiters. And kiss $40 entrees goodbye. Those are just a few of the scenarios cooked up by restaurant industry insiders after we asked them what they'd like to see more of – and less of – in 2007. While seasonal, high-quality ingredients are a perennial fave, this year there's a growing emphasis on environmentally friendly fare. A backlash against molecular gastronomy and fancy cooking techniques also foreshadows a return to simplicity. Of course, not every wish comes true. When we posed the same question to mavens in 2006, responses ranged from fewer people \"furiously texting their friends at other places\" (David Rabin of NYC's Lotus) to less \"Rachael Ray\" (Michael Franks of LA's Chez Melange), neither of which seem to be going out of style anytime soon. Now, without further ado, the 2007 wish list. We Need More: \"Duck. Health care for our workers.\" – Tom Douglas, chef-owner, Seattle's Dahlia Lounge and others David Bouley \"Eco-friendly choices. Chefs and retailers taking certain fish off their menu for five or six years to help them grow back in population. Japanese cooking, not just sushi bars. Creating food that is very tasty, but healthier for you. Healthy food for kids. Chefs interested in products, rather than techniques. I think with very good products, a consumer will remember more about the meal.\" – David Bouley, chef-owner, Miami's David Bouley Evolution, NYC's Bouley and others \"Wine lists featuring eclectic, interesting and [good] value wines from undiscovered regions like Greece, South Africa and Lebanon.\" – Gregory Condes, chef sommelier, NYC's Gordon Ramsay \"Grills, casseroles. Homestyle comfort food. Casual, fun restaurants that friends and family can all come to. I think people want simple ingredients and a simpler style of restaurant as well. – Tom Aikens, chef-owner, London's Tom Aikens and Tom's Kitchen Marcus Samuelsson \"Parents cooking more with their kids, because this gives them better choices and helps them get a sense of nurturing. Better food in schools. I wish people would take some time this year to capture some of their family heirloom recipes. And I'd love for taking walks to become hip.\" – Gale Gand, pastry chef/partner, Chicago's Tru, Tramonto's Steak & Seafood and others \"Mom and pop–style restaurants – especially as [NYC] gets more polished and expensive.\" – Marcus Samuelsson, chef-owner, NYC's Aquavit \"Food writers [who] support local chefs. Smaller portions. Quality fruits and vegetables and sustainable foods. Chef-driven restaurants. Inspired neighborhood restaurants. Service staff that is knowledgeable about food. Actors [who] can act like waiters. Contemporary comfort foods.\" – Robert Gadsby, chef, Noé in LA and Houston, among others Jose Garces \"Ethnic restaurants that have a higher level of service. More vegetarian sections on menus. I'd also like to see food technology be in the right hands, meaning there are a lot of innovative techniques these days, and in the wrong hands it could be disastrous and take away from the [new ideas] that people are coming up with. I'd like to see more in that style of innovative cooking, but done properly.\" – Jose Garces, chef-owner, Philly's Amada \"Smaller venues – I think for a while it was the big clubs, and now it's more of an intimate space, like your own living room in a public place. Music that's not too loud, so you can have a conversation. Classic good-tasting drinks, not over-sugared pink cocktails. Good ingredients, like fresh juices, because people care about what they put into their bodies.\" – Monika Chiang, general manager/partner, NYC's Double Seven Stephen Starr \"Home-cooked food. American rotisserie. Diversity. I think Thai cuisine hasn't really been explored fully. Thai is an Asian cuisine that has been kept sort of homegrown, and it hasn't made the transition into mainstream. And there's something about Africa that I think is untapped.\" – Stephen Starr, owner of Starr Restaurant organization, which includes Morimoto and Buddakan in Philly and NYC \"Chef-driven restaurants. To me, the only way you can do things right is to do them yourself. I think that fine-dining restaurants need to be a little less pretentious. They should be relaxed and user-friendly.\" – Morou Ouattara, chef-owner, Farrah Olivia in Alexandria, VA David Myers \"A sustainable mindset toward operating a restaurant. Biodynamic and organic wines. Classic cocktails and the technique used to make them.\" – David Myers, chef-owner, LA's Sona \"Real food. There's so much fusion food now, it's hard to find a traditional Italian or Mexican restaurant.\" – Zarela Martínez, chef-owner, NYC's Zarela \"Consciousness around food, by switching to certified humane meats and eggs and avoiding fish [that] are being over-harvested. Bone marrow on non-French menus in innovative dishes. Caramel [to] complement the adventurous new wave of cooking that highlights sweet and salty combinations. The continued importance of charcuterie. Pork!\" – Charlie Palmer, chef-owner, Aureole in NYC and Las Vegas, among others \"Tasting menus. Trust your chef in a great restaurant.\" – Sal Marino, chef-owner, LA's Il Grano Susanna Foo \"Purified water. Fresh juice. Asian food. Soybeans.\" – Susanna Foo, chef-owner, Philly's Susanna Foo and Susanna Foo's Gourmet Kitchen \"Leisurely dining. Global response to the way animals are being raised for consumption – the factorylike conditions in which a large percentage of beef, pork and poultry are raised are creating potentially unhealthy food. Fish being cooked at home! Yes, I know that I am the poster-boy for steak but one of my true loves is fish. Home cooks using more \"exotic\" ingredients like Asian chiles, curry paste, fish sauce, aged vinegars.\" – Laurent Tourondel, chef-owner, BLT Steak in NYC and DC, among others We Could Do With Less: Tom Aikens \"Fusion food. I call it fusion-confusion or confusion-fusion. I think you should define it a bit more. I don't think it works, or ever will work. I think that celebrity chefs are a thing of the past. I think it doesn't do much for the image of proper chefs really. I would like to abolish all that.\" – Tom Aikens, chef-owner, London's Tom Aikens and Tom's Kitchen \"Trans-fats – not that New Yorkers will have a choice in that – but there is no need to use unhealthy fats. Olive oil is one of the very few things I can't live without.\" – Laurent Tourondel, chef-owner, BLT Steak in NYC and DC, among others \"Not calling to cancel your reservation. Bringing your own wines to a restaurant.\" – Sal Marino, chef-owner, LA's Il Grano Zarela Martínez \"Forty dollar entrees. Overly designed restaurants. Amateurs – when I go out I want to see an owner, someone who cares.\" – Zarela Martínez, chef-owner, NYC's Zarela \"In DC, we need less steakhouses. We're starting to look like more of a steak-and-potato kind of town. We need more of Cooking 101 before going into molecular gastronomy. So many people are going into it without knowing how to actually cook, so it may look good, but it's not tasty.\" – Morou Ouattara, chef-owner, Farrah Olivia in Alexandria, VA Tom Douglas \"Reality shows about kitchens. They don't show what a real kitchen works like, where people are treated with respect.\" – Tom Douglas, chef-owner, Seattle's Dahlia Lounge and others \"Intimidating wine service at restaurants. Wine should be easy and accessible and enjoyed by all.\" – Gregory Condes, chef sommelier, NYC's Gordon Ramsay \"Low-end food establishments like chains.\" – Jose Garces, chef-owner, Philly's Amada \"Expensive rent. I think that real estate has gotten out of hand, and it's throwing off the crowd a bit. Nightclubs need to be more sensitive about how much revenue they're making every night, so they're focused on the big spenders rather than attracting a sophisticated, stylish crowd. I think it's a domino effect. In order to pay your rent, you'd have to sell out a little bit.\" – Monika Chiang, general manager/partner, NYC's Double Seven \"Tapas.\" – Charlie Palmer, chef-owner, Aureole in NYC and Las Vegas, among others \"Molecular gastronomy in the hands of amateurs who don't know how to use it. Concept restaurants.\" – Robert Gadsby, chef, Noé in LA and Houston, among others Gale Gand \"Less margarine, more butter. Less paper packaging on stuff. Less processed sugar, more organic sugar. Less processed food. Less soda pop, more wine. Less bad manufactured desserts, more homemade.\" – Gale Gand, pastry chef/partner, Chicago's Tru, Tramonto's Steak & Seafood and others \"In the end, I don't think we need less of anything. I believe that competition is good, and the public decides. In the end, the strong survive.\" – Stephen Starr, owner of Starr Restaurant organization, which includes Morimoto and Buddakan in Philly and NYC

By Michelle Golden, ZAGAT.com staff editor At these chocolate-centric cafes, towers of truffles and fudge-filled foodstuffs take center stage and you can focus your appetite on what really matters: dessert 'Tis the season to indulge, and where better to do so than at one of these chocolate-centric cafes, where towers of truffles and fudge-filled foodstuffs take center stage, and you can skip all those extraneous appetizers and superfluous salads and focus your appetite on what really matters: dessert. Cafe Fleuri 250 Franklin St., Boston, 617-451-1900 The Langham Hotel's seasonal Chocolate Bar lures cocoa aficionados with an all-you-can-eat buffet featuring a dizzying and decadent selection of white-, milk- and dark-chocolate pastries, tarts, fondues, brûlées, brioche, puddings and cookies; N.B. open through May. Chocolate Pink Chocolate Pink 905 Juniper St., Atlanta, 404-745-9292 The namesake dessert at this stylish new Atlanta cafe is a triple chocolate threat with ganache, mousse and cake layered atop a hazelnut cookie base; cheesecakes, fruit tarts and petit fours round out the mostly cocoa-focused menu. Coco Noche 1140 Highland Ave., Manhattan Beach, CA, 310-545-4925 This relative newcomer, just a block from the surf in Manhattan Beach, offers chocolate and wine pairings as well as a full menu of savory Asian-inspired small plates; seasonal sweets include fiery-red cayenne and sunflower-encrusted dark chocolate as well as bonbons stuffed with strawberry ganache. Dilettante Dilettante 400 Pine St., Seattle, 206-903-8595 416 Broadway E., Seattle, 206-329-6463 Keep your buzz going with alcohol and cocoa-infused coffee drinks at this Seattle duo where savory snacks complement the wide selection of truffles and other goodies; if you can't make it to the store, browse their century-old chocolate concoctions (prepared from family recipes) online. Ethel's Chocolate Lounge Fashion Show Mall, 3200 Las Vegas Blvd. S., Las Vegas, 702-796-6662 As if Las Vegas wasn't decadent enough, this new chocolate \"lounge\" (a sit-down outpost from the folks behind Ethel M chocolate shops) luxuriates in handcrafted bonbons and cocoa-blended beverages making it a sweet stop for chocoholics trolling the Strip; N.B. factory tours are available at their main retail store in Henderson (2 Cactus Garden Dr., 702-458-8864). Max Brenner Max Brenner 841 Broadway, Manhattan, 212-388-0030 141 Second Ave., Manhattan, 212-388-0030 These two NYC cafes – including a brand-new East Village branch – fancy themselves as Willy Wonka–like fantasylands with an extravagant selection of outlandishly plated desserts (chocolate pizza, anyone?), as well as fondues, frappes, s'mores and an endless array of pastries and packaged goodies; a comfort-food menu of sandwiches, soups and salads takes the edge off the sweets. Naked Chocolate Café 1317 Walnut St., Philadelphia, 215-735-7310 Luxurious sipping chocolates as well as chocolate-dipped strawberries, pots de crème, tarts and finely blended teas offer a dainty way to get an afternoon sugar rush after hitting the shops and shows in Philly's Center City; a full line of handmade truffles and confections, as well as tiny tins of chocolate caviar and hunks of holiday peppermint bark, make for fine parting gifts.

By Yoji Yamaguchi, ZAGAT.com staff editor Follow these golden rules of reserving to increase your odds of getting a foot in the door – and a fork in your mouth Related Stories Join the \"In\" Crowd \"Beg, lie, cheat or sell your soul to the devil\" – to hear our surveyors tell it, there are no lengths that desperate diners won't go to in order to land a table at a hard-to-get-into restaurant. And the restaurants themselves have seen all the ploys. per se At per se, Thomas Keller's famously difficult-to-book 15-table venue in Manhattan's Time Warner Center, at least one would-be customer sent money in the mail, apparently convinced that bribery was the surest route to a reservation. Another gambit: dropping the name of a well-connected – if imaginary – friend. One hapless diner phoned Grace, a Los Angeles foodie fave, claiming to be a close buddy of chef Neal Fraser – too bad he was speaking to Amy Knoll Fraser (aka Mrs. Neal Fraser). And then there's the shameless 'grant-me-my-final-wish' ruse. \"We get a lot of people who say they're dying and want to have their last meal\" here, says chef Gary Danko, whose eponymous restaurant is one of San Francisco's toughest tickets. Nobu photo: Steven Freeman Rao's photo: Johnny Miller Frustrations associated with reserving are a common refrain among Zagat surveyors nationwide, but perhaps nowhere more so than in New York, where diners speak of \"torture\" and \"anguish\" when describing the process of trying to book at places like Nobu (\"set your alarm for 30 days ahead and hold multiple phones on auto-dial\") or the notoriously inaccessible Rao's (\"befriend a regular\" or \"fuhgeddaboudit\"). Actually, getting into Rao's just got a whole lot easier – all you have to do is call the reservations line (702-731-RAOS). Of course, we're talking about the new Las Vegas branch, slated to open in December in Caesars Palace, not the East Harlem institution presided over by the aptly nicknamed Frankie 'No' Pellegrino. Short of sacrificing your firstborn, what can you do to score a seat at a hot spot? Follow these golden rules of reserving to increase your odds of getting a foot in the door – and a fork in your mouth: Plan ahead. It's a no-brainer but it bears repeating: calling weeks in advance is your best shot at getting a table. At places like per se and Gary Danko, two months in advance is the norm. Or try last-minute. Nobu GM Richie Notar suggests showing up when the doors open to check for cancellations that night – you might get lucky. And don't forget to ask about dining at the sushi bar (or the regular bar in any restaurant). Be flexible. If dinner is impossible, consider lunch, which is often more accessible yet gives you the same been-there-done-that bragging rights. Work the waiting list. Some places with waiting lists recommend that you call back periodically to see if an earlier date has opened up, while others prefer that you don't, so ask the reservationist. Either way, give them your mobile or pager number instead of your office or home phone number so you'll be reachable in case there's a last-minute opening. Give thanks. If a reservationist is especially helpful, a thank-you note is not only gracious, it may help the right person remember you the next time you call. Reconfirm. Once you've succeeded in landing a reservation, call the day before (or whenever the restaurant specifies) to reconfirm or risk losing it.

By Jessica Grose and Liz Borod Wright, ZAGAT.com staff editors Some places are hard to get into by virtue of their popularity; others achieve at least the aura of exclusivity by means of things like unlisted phone numbers and unmarked entrances. Following is a sampling of spots in various cities where you may need a little know-how, a little patience, a lot of luck – or simply the right connections – in order to get past the door, especially at prime times. Related Stories Tough Tables Alinea 1723 N. Halsted St., Chicago, 312-867-0110 Flexibility is the key to cracking this avant-garde New American, which has been one of Chicago's most talked-about spots since opening last year. According to maitre d'hotel Katie Syracopoulos, the wait for reservations is currently eight weeks for prime-time slots on Fridays or Saturday nights. But if you're willing to dine on other nights, you can call just a week out to sample Grant Achatz's inventive cuisine. The Brazen Head The Brazen Head 3166 Buchanan St., San Francisco, 415-921-7600 The main secret to getting into this tiny, no-reserving San Francisco tavern is simply knowing about it: even though it's been around for over 25 years, it manages to hide in plain sight thanks to its lack of signage. Clued-in locals appreciate its friendly vibe, \"unbelievable martinis\" and classic American menu served until 1 AM. Chef Vola's 111 S. Albion Pl., Atlantic City, 609-345-2022 Tables are reserved by regulars at the beginning of the year at this family-run Italian joint near the Boardwalk in Atlantic City, making it especially difficult for nonregulars to snag a seat. So do as our surveyors suggest and get to \"know the right people,\" starting with mama – according to Louis Esposito, the son of owner Louise Esposito, \"basically my mother handles [the reservations].\" Dan Tana's 9071 Santa Monica Blvd., West Hollywood, 310-275-9444 Regulars have the best shot at getting in (and being seated immediately) at this clubby Hollywood Italian institution and celeb magnet. If you aren't among those who dine here several times a week, plan on calling about four days ahead to land a table, and don't be surprised if, as some surveyors report, you wind up waiting \"forever\" to be seated. La Esquina 106 Kenmare St., Manhattan, 646-613-7100 Cool-hunters don't let themselves get sidetracked by this Manhattan Mexican's taco stand or cafe, but instead focus on the underground (literally) dining scene. Sure, you can make reservations (accepted up to three weeks in advance), but even so it feels like a coup to get in thanks to its speakeasylike entrance routine: walk through the taco stand's \"employees only\" door and head downstairs, where you'll be escorted through the kitchen to the dining room. Milk and Honey 134 Eldridge St., Manhattan, unlisted phone Famed for owner-mixologist Sasha Petraske's fresh-ingredient cocktails, this sign-less boîte is one of Manhattan's toughest doors. Reservations via a secret, unlisted phone number are mandatory, and even if you manage to get the magic number (best bets are a connected friend or a Web search), it's been known to change. But you can always drown your disappointment at one of Petraske's other, more accessible Manhattan ventures (East Side Company Bar, Little Branch) or try Milk and Honey's London outpost, which functions as a private club but allows nonmembers to make reservations before 11 PM. Minibar at Café Atlantico photo: Robert Finkelstadt Minibar at Café Atlantico 405 Eighth St. NW, Washington, DC, 202-393-0812 The only way to score one of the six seats at the Minibar – located within Café Atlantico, the popular DC Nuevo Latino – is to call 30 days in advance. \"For a December 3rd reservation, you call November 3rd. There are two seatings, one at 6:30, and one at 8:30, and calls are only accepted between 9 and 11 AM and 2:30 and 4 PM,\" explains host Stanley Gray. So plan ahead and hit that speed dial if you want to experience its creative tasting menu featuring 30-plus bite-size offerings. PX PX 728 King St., Alexandria, VA, 703-299-8384 Visual cues point the way to this swanky, speakeasy-themed upstairs lounge in Alexandria's Old Town. First check to see if the pirate flag is flying above the entrance to Eammon's – A Dublin Chipper (which, like the lounge, is owned by Cathal and Meshelle Armstrong, of Restaurant Eve fame), then go around the corner and look for an unmarked door with a blue light and buzz for entry. Cocktails and a hip vibe await. Rao's 455 E 114th St., Manhattan, 212-722-6709 The all-time champ of tough-to-book restaurants may be NYC's Rao's, where if you're not a regular or friend of a regular, getting in is nigh on impossible. What can average folk do? Co-owner Ron Straci says, \"If you come to the restaurant and get a drink at the bar, ask when the next table is open. It might be six months from now, but you might get a reservation.\" Rao's rejects may face better odds in Vegas, where a branch of the original is opening at Caesars Palace in December, complete with reservations line (702-731-RAOS).

They Charged Me For That?

By Liz Borod Wright, ZAGAT.com staff editor You enjoyed your meal – until you got the check and realized you'd been billed for something you assumed was free. We recently asked ZAGAT.com users to tell us about unexpected fees they've encountered at restaurants. Service charges were frequent culprits, from an unstated gratuity policy to a mandatory captain's fee. Add-ons for things like sharing, or for bread baskets that arrived unbidden, also earned gripes. So did various petty charges: 75¢ for extra sprinklings of cilantro (on a check that totaled over $100); $2 for the unordered tea that appeared with a meal at a Chinese restaurant; $2.25 for the containers used to package a party's doggy bags. Read on for a selection of other complaints, as well as the restaurants' responses and our take on the situation. One general tip: if you feel a fee is unfair, talk to the manager. Several respondents say they succeeded in having an offending charge removed. The Fee: 10% for takeout The Restaurant: Next Door Nobu, NYC The Story: \"I was shocked,\" says one patron who was ordering takeout to surprise friends and found a $7.50 fee (\"I was told it was a packaging fee\") on the bill. \"I asked if they also charge a dirty plate fee when people eat in. They didn't find it funny. I don't find $7.50 for two boxes and a paper bag funny. If you don't want to do takeout – don't. Fining people for it [is] a bit too much.\" The Response: \"The 10% fee is a service charge to defray costs,\" says owners The Myriad Group. They declined to elaborate. Our Take: Next Door Nobu does spell out the fee on its take-out menu, though not on its Web site. Either way, it's easy to understand why take-out fees surprise some patrons, since they're not getting table service or benefiting from a restaurant's atmosphere. The Fee: $7 for nuts The Restaurant: Royalton Lounge, NYC The Story: \"Four of us stopped into the Royalton Hotel cocktail lounge,\" reports one respondent. They enjoyed the atmosphere (\"very avant-garde\") as well as the drinks, but the \"kicker\" came when they asked for some nuts: \"We were charged $7! That's a bit unfair.\" The Response: Though the Royalton couldn't be reached for an official response, we checked and found that the nuts are essentially treated like a menu item. Our Take: Sad to say, free nibbles are not always a given with cocktails, so ask before ordering if you don't want to be surprised. The Fee: An \"Arnold Palmer\" premium? The Restaurant: The Cheesecake Factory, Marina del Rey, CA The Story: A diner lunching with a friend at the popular chain noted that an iced tea cost $2.50. \"[But] an Arnold Palmer – half iced tea and half lemonade – was $3.75!\" On the plus side, \"They did offer complimentary refills.\" The Response: Even though it's half lemonade and half iced tea, an Arnold Palmer \"comes from the bar as it is a mixed drink. Also, lemonade costs more than brewing iced tea,\" explains Howard Gordon, senior vice president of business development and marketing with the Cheesecake Factory, Inc. (and yes, the prices noted above are correct and include unlimited refills). Our Take: It's not surprising that an Arnold Palmer costs as much as the more expensive beverage in it (a glass of lemonade at The Cheesecake Factory is $3.75). But it might surprise a diner, since the chain doesn't print prices on its beverage menu – maybe that's the real issue here. The Fee: \"Straight-up\" surcharge The Restaurant: Del Posto, NYC The Story: A martini maven reports being \"charged an extra $2 on top of [the drink's] already fat price because it was ordered 'up' rather than on the rocks. Of course, classic martinis are always 'up' and in a martini glass.\" The Response: \"We charge extra because a drink without ice has between 30 and 35% more liquor, the main cost in a beverage, especially a 'high call' brand liquor in an up drink like a martini, which has virtually no mixer in it,\" says co-owner Mario Batali. Our Take: Why not make the basic price of a martini reflect the standard straight-up version; that way, patrons who order it on the rocks could be charged less – wouldn't that be a nice surprise! The Fee: 5% service charge for kitchen staff The Restaurant: Incanto, San Francisco The Story: \"Since I have always considered the kitchen and bus staff included in the usual tip, I deducted the 5% fee amount from my normal tip,\" reports one diner who encountered the fee. The Response: The notion that tips are shared throughout the restaurant staff \"is not an entirely correct perception,\" replies Mark Pastore, Incanto's owner. \"California law (section 352 of the California Labor Code) prohibits restaurant management from requiring servers to share tips with kitchen staff.\" The 5% charge is therefore \"a legal means for sharing the rewards of service with our non-tipped employees. We use the proceeds to, among other things, provide 100% employer-paid medical, dental and vision insurance to full-time staff,\" says Pastore. Why not just raise prices? Pastore believes the service charge \"makes better financial sense for our guests,\" since someone \"who normally tips 15% can adjust to 10%, or from 20% to 15%, which in the end means that the guest did not pay any more for his/her meal, we merely re-allocated where the guest's money went.\" Our Take: Who can argue with efforts to offer more equitable working conditions? Incanto also gets points for clearly noting the fee on the menu. Still, it's possible that some diners might be confused by the charge and end up tipping more (or less) than intended. The Fee: $1 rice charge The Restaurant: The Slanted Door, San Francisco The Story: \"The server asked if we wanted rice with our dishes, and we said 'yes,' but there was no mention either by him or, as far as we could recall, on the menu, that it cost [$1] extra\" per order. The Response: Faith Wheeler, a brand specialist and consultant to the restaurant, says that chef-owner Charles Phan believes that charging for rice is the norm. \"Even the cheapest of Chinese restaurants in San Francisco offers rice for $1. Free tea, perhaps, but not free rice,\" she says. Our Take: The rice charge actually is clearly stated on the menu, and à la carte sides have become commonplace. But that doesn't mean all guests will be happy about it.

Atlanta Boston Chicago Las Vegas London Los Angeles Miami New York City Philadelphia San Francisco Washington, DC Fall is here and with it, a host of vibrant culinary choices. This season's hefty crop of newcomers ensures variety, not to mention plenty of unexpected options (Thomas Keller does burgers, Tom Aikens does snooker tables). Meanwhile, celebrity chefs continue to zigzag their way across the country – David Bouley hits Miami, Tom Colicchio goes to LA, Gordon Ramsay takes both coasts – while local faves debut new ventures closer to home (Susanna Foo in Philly, Rick Tramonto and Gale Gand in Chicago). From splashy spectacle to neighborhood staple, here's what you can expect in the months to come. Shaun Doty will debut Shaun's in October Atlanta Dolce Enoteca e Ristorante: Ashton Kutcher and his celebrity pals take on Atlanta in late October when his restaurant group opens a second location of Dolce Enoteca e Ristorante, LA's scene-y Northern Italian, at Atlantic Station (261 19th St.; 404-872-3902). Geisha House: Another transplant from Los Angeles courtesy of the Dolce Group, this Japanese eatery will open at Atlantic Station (1380 Atlanta Dr.; 404-872-3903) in December in a setting that's designed to look like a high-end brothel. Roberto's World Tapas: Duluth diners can sample a wide variety of small plates in a contemporary setting at this Eclectic newcomer (9700 Medlock Bridge Rd.; 770-662-4056), opening on October 3rd. Shaun's: Shaun Doty will leave his post as executive chef at Table 1280 (but will remain involved as a consultant) to open this New American restaurant in Inman Park (1029 Edgewood Ave.) in October. Trois: From the owners of ONE. midtown kitchen and TWO. urban licks comes this New French restaurant arriving in Midtown (1180 Peachtree St.; 404-815-3337) in late October. Back to Top Boston Rendang: In the industrial loftlike space (57 JFK St.) that the Harvard Square branch of Penang used to occupy comes yet another Malaysian eatery, this one from the owners of OM, debuting in October. Rustic Kitchen: The latest branch of this Med bistro chainlet, opening in October in Park Square (210 Stuart St.; 617-423-5700), will house a TV studio kitchen (several cooking shows are in the works) that patrons will be able to view from the dining room. Back to Top Gale Gand and Rick Tramonto are teaming up at Wheeling's new Westin Hotel Chicago Cru Café & Wine Bar: Debbie Sharpe's Gold Coast wine bar (888 N. Wabash Ave.) reopens in October – expanded, refurbished and accompanied by an outpost of her Goddess and the Grocer gourmet market. Fiddlehead Cafe: Taking over the remodeled Square Kitchen space in Lincoln Square (4600 N. Lincoln Ave.) sometime in October, this New American will showcase seasonal eats from chef Robert Levitt (del Toro, 312 Chicago). Flatearth: This organic flatbread-sandwich-salad spot from Michael Altenberg (Bistro Campagne) will hit Wicker Park (2056 W. Division St.) in December. Lush: Now that the long-delayed Pasteur spin-off, Viet Bistro, is finally set to open in October at 1344 W. Devon Ave., another sequel is already in the offing. Slated for a late fall debut at 2269 N. Lincoln Ave., this Lincoln Parker will serve casual, affordable Vietnamese vittles. Nick's Grill: The Nick's Fishmarket folks will take off their tuxedos for this more relaxed seafood sibling in Deerfield's former Masck space (483 Lake Cook Rd.), opening in late September. Osteria di Tramonto/Tramonto's Steak & Seafood: This casual Italian cafe and upscale surf 'n' turfer, slated for an October 12th and a November 7th opening, respectively, in Wheeling's new Westin Hotel (601 N. Milwaukee Ave.), result from Tru chef team Rick Tramonto and Gale Gand's new development partnership with Cenitare Restaurant Group. The duo will continue their responsibilities at Tru. Sequel: The owners of Lombard's shuttered Bistro Banlieue are transforming their much-loved French bistro into this New American restaurant opening in November (44 Yorktown Convenience Ctr.; 630-629-6560). The redecorated space will feature fewer tables with upgraded stemware and dinnerware and a new wine list incorporating some New World selections after 17 years of all French and American offerings. Shikago: The Shikami brothers will follow up Kevin with this more casual Asian-leaning concept opening in the Loop (190 S. LaSalle St.) in December. Stanley's Kitchen & Tap: A West Loop outpost of this down-home American joint is opening in October at 324 South Racine St. Back to Top Michael Mina will open Strip Steak in early October (photo by Karl Petzku) Las Vegas Japonais: With a new NYC location under its belt, this trendy Japanese restaurant will bring its sexy sushi formula to Vegas next, opening a branch at the Mirage (3799 Las Vegas Blvd. S.) on September 29th. Nove Italiano: The owners of N9ne Steakhouse will debut this Italian eatery in the new Fantasy Tower at the Palms Casino Hotel (4321 W. Flamingo Rd., 702-942-7777) on October 9th; the old-meets-new setting translates into vaulted ceilings with metallic tiles. Rao's: Like everything in Las Vegas, the Caesars Palace outpost of NYC's famously insular Italian (3570 Las Vegas Blvd. S.; 877-346-4642) promises to be outsized – meaning your uncle from Skokie actually has a chance of nabbing a table. There will be a variety of spaces, including two replicas of the original (each complete with 10 tables and jukebox), as well as an outdoor terrace with a bocce court. The restaurant will begin accepting reservations in October for its December opening. Strip Steak: Michael Mina of the eponymous San Francisco restaurant opens his fourth Las Vegas property, a steakhouse in a modern, opulent setting at the Mandalay Bay Resort (3950 Las Vegas Blvd. S.), on October 2nd. Back to Top London Barrafina: In December, the owners of Fino will open this Soho tapas bar (54 Frith St., W1; 020 7813 8010), where the casual setup will feature a mere 25 counter seats, a no-reservations policy and hours from noon to midnight. The Spanish menu will offer simpler, more affordable fare than the Fitzrovia flagship, including seafood cooked on a \"plancha,\" the traditional Spanish grill. Mimosa Bar & Restaurant: Opening in November in Belgravia's new Jumeirah Lowndes Hotel (sister hotel to the Jumeirah Carlton Tower) is this bistro-style Mediterranean (21 Lowndes St., SW1) with alfresco dining, plus a tapas and meze option during the day.

Q&A with Michael Lomonaco

***CONTENT
By Michael Mahle For Michael Lomonaco, September 2006 will be a time for looking back in remembrance as well as looking forward to a new chapter in his career. Five years ago, Lomonaco was chef at Windows on the World atop the World Trade Center, then the country's highest-grossing restaurant. Sheer luck – in his case, a stop at an eyeglass shop on his way to work – is the only reason he wasn't among the Windows employees who perished on 9/11. Now he is about to open Porter House New York, an American grill in another iconic New York City building, the Time Warner Center. We spoke with Lomonaco about his plans for the new venture and his take on the state of the restaurant industry today. ZS: What is it about mega-buildings like the World Trade Center and Time Warner Center that attracts you as a chef and restaurateur? Lomonaco: \"Just the idea of being at the World Trade Center was very exciting because it was a recognizable landmark. We were able to serve a very international audience of people who were excited to be in the restaurant. Not to mention [excited by] the spectacular views. The Time Warner Center is at an unbelievable location that really has its finger on the pulse of the city. The rhythm and movement in the area of Central Park South is electric. It's alive.\" ZS: You have some famous neighbors at the Time Warner Center – Thomas Keller (per se), Masa Takayama (Masa) and Gray Kunz (Café Gray). In fact, some people have characterized the restaurants at the Time Warner Center as upscale mall dining. Your view? Lomonaco: \"I wouldn't classify it as a mall. It's more like a piazza or public square, similar to the Galleria in Naples, Italy, where many different trades are represented. Having this eclectic group of restaurants and shops enhances the experience simply by the presence of the other businesses.\" ZS: There's been something of a steakhouse stampede across the nation lately. How do you hope to make Porter House stand out from the crowd? Lomonaco: \"I'd classify Porter House as an American grill. We will serve a great selection of steaks from a couple of different ranches I've picked myself as well as native North American fish and seafood, from wild salmon to Wellfleet oysters. Veal, Berkshire pork, Colorado lamb, venison and other wild game will be featured regularly on the menu as well. The fact that I'll be in the kitchen every night, and that Porter House is a truly chef-driven restaurant, [also] makes it a little different.\" ZS: Year after year, our survey participants rate service as the weakest part of their dining experiences. What's your take on that? Lomonaco: \"The level of service in restaurants has greatly improved over the last decade and that's because people want to be in this business. Waiting on tables, bartending or managing a restaurant and other front-of-house positions are no longer jobs you take because you couldn't find anything else. People are genuinely interested in working in this industry. The recent wave of television shows on the Food Network, Discovery Channel, even Bravo and Fox, as well as the surge of enrollment in culinary schools is proof positive.\" \"A great restaurant's success is [really based] on how its guests are served. And if something goes wrong, which it inevitably will, how do we make up for that? How mistakes are fixed is what matters.\" ZS: You mentioned food-focused television shows. Why are they so popular today? Lomonaco: \"Food has become one of the top five topics of conversation – and it's because it's all about pleasure. Pure pleasure. To cook nice meals for your family or guests as well as going out to eat a nice meal in a restaurant is simply enjoyable.\" ZS: Restaurant design has become a very big business – your Time Warner Center neighbor per se reportedly cost about $16 million to design and build. Has this gotten out of hand? Lomonaco: \"The experienced diner has come to see the entertainment value in restaurants and appreciate the production values that go into them. As in any artistic expression, a visionary such as Thomas Keller knows that details express the degree to which true commitment has been made. It's through the details that the transporting experience he envisioned [is realized].\" ZS: How involved were you in the design of Porter House? Lomonaco: \"I was involved from the very beginning; in the pre-planning conceptualization stage, the design and ideation, and all through the construction, spending a great deal of time with the contractors. Porter House expresses a great deal about me and my cooking and what I value in a restaurant: comfortable and informal surroundings, clean and pure lines of natural materials – wood, stone, metal and warmth through color and materials that [create] a convivial and hospitable environment, conducive to fun and conversation.\" ZS: You are among the many people who lost close friends and colleagues on 9/11. How are you observing the fifth anniversary? Lomonaco: \"I plan on attending the memorial services at Ground Zero in the morning and using the day as a reflective day and time of remembrance.\" ZS: Thirty is the highest score Zagat surveyors can give a restaurant when rating its food, decor and service. Other than your own, tell us which restaurant achieves those scores in your estimation. Lomonaco: \"I remember everything about my first visit to The French Laundry in 1994. The meal, service and decor, even the beautiful herb garden out back was perfect and would get 30s all around. The Herbfarm in Seattle would also get a 30 for food.\"

What To Know About BYO
***AUTHOR
BuzzEditor

***CONTENT
By Karen Hudes, ZAGAT.com staff editor <p>Is it really legal to bring your own wine into your favorite Manhattan BYO bistro? Can you get past the door with a Bordeaux in Boston? And will a Chicago waiter fill your glass if you've supplied the vino? The answers to those questions may surprise you, because the deceptively simple practice of bringing your own bottle to a restaurant actually involves a morass of laws, loopholes and licensing struggles that vary from city to city. But when it works, BYO can be a boon for diners who want to sip a favorite wine without paying a big markup. It can also be a plus for restaurateurs, since it can save them from having to spring for a pricey liquor license – and often becomes a selling point in its own right. Philadelphia, the City of BYO Love Philadelphia is home to one of the most active bring-your-own scenes in the U.S., with over 200 restaurants that cater to it. Pioneers of the trend range from bistros to fine-dining establishments, such as Audrey Claire, Django and Gilmore's. What accounts for its prevalence? Pennsylvania's stringent alcohol licensing laws are a major factor. Not only are licenses costly, but the state's Liquor Control Board is currently not issuing new ones (though owners can purchase existing licenses and have them transferred). Yet there are no laws prohibiting restaurant patrons from bringing their own bottle. Add in business-savvy chefs looking to draw budget-conscious diners – Philly folk still retain a touch of \"blue-collar\" mentality and \"like to get value,\" according to Patrick Conway, CEO of the Pennsylvania Restaurant Association – and you have a rich terroir for BYO. The absence of a corkage fee at many of these places makes it even more attractive – so much so that many licensed restaurants have taken to offering corkage-free BYO nights. The twist: Officially, those BYO wines are only legal if you buy them on Pennsylvania soil. In NYC, BYO fans may unwittingly be engaging in an illicit activity. Though the cost of obtaining a beer and wine license in New York City is relatively reasonable (less than $1,000 before legal fees), actually getting a license is no mean feat due to state Liquor Authority restrictions and community board concerns. Mark B. Stumer, an attorney who represents a number of New York restaurants, says that when owners' applications are rejected, \"everyone thinks, 'ok, I could have people bring their own.'\" Not so – at least not technically. BYO is illegal in New York City for restaurants without a license to serve beer and wine. (Licensed restaurants can legally allow BYO, but they may choose not to permit it.) Just ask Bob Giraldi and Jason Hennings, whose attempts to obtain a liquor license for European Union, the gastropub they hoped to open in the East Village this past spring, faced a number of stumbling blocks. After first being denied a license by the state, largely due to pressure from the Village community board, EU briefly operated as a BYO – until the authorities informed the owners the policy was illegal. The restaurant shut down in the interim, but following months of petitioning and negotiating with the board, it finally nabbed a beer and wine license and will reopen in September. Though BYO crackdowns aren't the norm, they do happen. Nicky Perry, co-owner of the West Village British cafe Tea & Sympathy, says she let patrons bring their own for more than a decade, until she \"got some stinking letter from the Liquor Authority\" last year telling her to stop. \"I was really shocked – it's ridiculous,\" Perry says. Her customers would surely raise a glass to that – if they could fill it. The twist: Restaurants that seat fewer than 20 are permitted to offer BYO even without a beer and wine license. In Boston proper, BYO's a no-go. Puritan-inspired \"blue laws\" still have a grip on Beantown, which outlaws BYO in any establishment, licensed or not. But that doesn't hold true for all of Massachusetts. In several Boston suburbs, BYO is legal, but – as opposed to NYC – only in restaurants with no liquor license. BYO turned out to be the charm for Sweet Basil, located in the primarily \"dry\" town of Needham. Six years ago, chef-owner Dave Becker tried and failed to get a license because his establishment didn't meet the requirement of seating at least 100. So he went the BYO route and today he says Sweet Basil \"is known\" for it. \"People bring everything from two-buck Chuck to moldy treasures from the cellar,\" he notes. Even though Becker plans to expand to a space that would seat more than 100, he intends to keep his signature BYO policy rather than pursue a license. The twist: It's common for patrons who've brought in rare vintages to offer tastes to the waiter and chef. In Massachusetts, however, that's illegal. They'll pop your cork in Chicago – but don't expect them to pour. A complex history involving Prohibition, corruption and a temperance-triggered run on liquor licenses has led to rules on licensing and serving alcohol in Chicago that are partly permissive, partly rigid and occasionally symbolic. It's legal to BYO to both licensed and unlicensed restaurants, and according to Gregory Steadman, general counsel of the City of Chicago Department of Business Affairs and Licensing, it's a growing trend. Yet while charging a corkage fee is legal, it is \"discouraged,\" since any actions suggesting that an unlicensed establishment is profiting from alcohol sales could lead to an investigation. Too much handling of the wine can also raise the authorities' eyebrows. \"The staff can provide glasses,\" he says, but \"the customers should serve themselves.\" The twist: BYO is only illegal during the approximately one-month period when a liquor license is pending. Even when BYO is legal, restaurant owners nationwide can prohibit it – but just try that in San Francisco. Plenty of San Franciscans like to BYO – it's legal in both licensed and unlicensed restaurants and is also widespread in nearby Napa Valley. But Craig Stoll, co-owner of SF's licensed and BYO-friendly Delfina, chose to prohibit BYO when he opened Pizzeria Delfina last year. \"We wanted to sell the wine that we put the effort into having,\" explains Stoll, who built a cellar complete with temperature-control equipment to house his carefully chosen Southern Italian list. Just as it's not accepted for diners to \"bring their own lamp to the table,\" says Stoll, he sought to preserve his \"vision\" for the restaurant, while keeping wine prices under $40. Stoll's move stirred up a fuss in the local press and on blogs, where the policy was criticized for going against the city's customer-first, \"service industry\" tradition. \"People have gotten used to [BYO],\" Stoll notes. \"It's the default policy and people don't like to be told 'no.'\" While hoping not to alienate diners, he remains adamant about serving his selected wines, adding that he's heard from kindred restaurateurs who \"swear they'll have the same policy.\" Have it your way in the Big Easy. Not only can you BYO to both licensed and unlicensed establishments in New Orleans, you can also quaff alcoholic drinks on the street (in \"to-go\" cups rather than glass containers). And where else can you find drive-thru daiquiri vendors? Still, the city has its standards – \"open containers\" in cars are a no-no, so it's illegal to serve those daiquiris with a straw. Corkage-free nights are on the rise. Corkage fees are charged by some restaurants to cover the costs of opening, serving and providing glassware for patron-supplied wines; they also help recoup some of the profits that would have been made from wine markups. Fees range from a nominal amount to as much as $85 at high-end, licensed restaurants. But a growing number of owners are offering corkage-free nights to drum up business. Drew Nieporent instituted no-corkage-fee Mondays at his NYC bistro Montrachet in response to smaller crowds post-9/11 (the normal fee is $25 a bottle). The result: \"Monday has become the busiest day of the week,\" says Nieporent, who offers a \"bring one, buy one\" no-corkage policy other nights. He notes that fee-free nights are especially popular with customers who have special wines that they want to enjoy \"with special food.\" And the deals rarely take a significant bite out of profits because they help ensure that seats are filled and \"eventually, big drinkers delve into your list.\" Buoyed by the success at Montrachet, Nieporent has introduced corkage-free Mondays at another of his NYC restaurants, Tribeca Grill. Increasingly, diners can \"BIH\" (bring it home). A number of states have passed so-called \"Merlot-to-go\" laws allowing patrons to take unfinished bottles of wine home, a move largely intended to discourage diners – many of whom might also be drivers – from over-indulging just to polish off a bottle. Rules associated with the law vary. New York State, for example, enacted such a law in 2004, permitting diners to remove bottles from restaurants only if they're resealed and placed in a tamper-proof, \"one-time-use\" transparent bag. Is the practice taking off? Charles Hunt, executive vice president of the New York State Restaurant Association, says that when the law passed, his organization sold batches of 250 bags to a number of restaurants. So far, he says, \"Nobody's called to reorder.\"

Viva Atlantic City

By Michael Klein photo: The Atlantic City Convention and Visitor's Authority Top-notch food and entertainment. Sumptuous decor. Free-spending clientele. The East Coast's hottest late-night scene. That was Atlantic City back in the late '40s and '50s, when the 500 Club and Copa Room were king and the Rat Pack roamed the Jersey Shore. A half-century later, it's the vibe of Atlantic City once again. Though the world-famous boardwalk is still a collection of honky-tonk arcades and cheap shops by the Atlantic Ocean, the town's 12 casinos have been upping the ante on glitz and glamour. And perhaps taking inspiration from – or looking to compete with – their desert brethren in Las Vegas, they've also been turning up the heat in the kitchen. The last few years have seen the debuts of dozens of high-profile eateries helmed by headliner chefs. Michael Mina, Wolfgang Puck and Bobby Flay (courtesy of Borgata) photo: Borgata In late June, the action centered around the Borgata's quarter-billion-dollar expansion, which brought forth Bobby Flay Steak, a sleek, David Rockwell–designed meatery; SeaBlue, a stylish seafooder from Michael Mina; and Wolfgang Puck American Grille, featuring a blazing open grill. \"I had been asked many times to do a restaurant here,\" Puck said recently. \"But the Borgata promised to do it right.\" The casino provided most of the money and staff, which the celeb chefs train. Last winter, Gallagher's Steak House, a branch of the NYC veteran, opened in Resorts, while Caesars added Mia, an ambitious Italian from Chris Scarduzio and Le Bec-Fin founder Georges Perrier, the team that owns Brasserie Perrier in Philadelphia. The Tropicana got into the game in 2004 with the Quarter at Tropicana, a $245 million retail/dining complex that's home to Carmine's, a branch of the popular New York City family-style Italian; Cuba Libre, a Latin by way of Philadelphia; and an outpost of the Palm steakhouse, among others. The feeding frenzy will continue this fall and winter, when 10 destinations are scheduled to debut on the new Pier at Caesars, a $200 million dining/shopping complex jutting into the Atlantic. The restaurant lineup, due to begin opening in September, will include spin-offs of the Philadelphia hits Buddakan (a Pan-Asian) and The Continental (a martini bar/small-plater), both from restaurateur Stephen Starr; a version of Boston's Eclectic eatery Sonsie; and Vino Noir (a wine bar). On tap for January is a sibling to Jeffrey Chodorow's Vegas fave, rumjungle, a tropical-themed nightclub. The Pier will also house a tony mall (think Burberry, Gucci, Louis Vuitton) as well as – shades of Vegas – a wedding chapel, due this winter. All the high-end dining action represents something of a sea change for this shore resort. For most of the quarter century since the advent of gambling in A.C., casinos regarded fine dining only in terms of comps for high rollers. But \"food no longer takes a backseat,\" observes Victor Tiffany, the Borgata's vice president of food and beverage. The reason is clear: \"We expect to make money,\" says Tiffany. Las Vegas casino operators who've brought in big-name restaurants have been doing just that for a dozen years. The Borgata began raising the A.C. culinary stakes at its 2003 opening, when it unveiled restaurants including the elegant Italian Specchio and Ombra, a grottolike wine bar, both from Luke Palladino; Suilan, an upscale Chinese-French fusion specialist from innovative Philly chef Susanna Foo; and a branch of New York–based Old Homestead steakhouse. The restaurants, operated by the casino under licensing deals, have finished squarely in the black, Tiffany says. Clientele at these swank restaurants – where most entrees are north of $30 – is anything but the casino-bus crowd. On a recent Saturday night, the dining rooms drew a mix ranging from New Yorkers to Asian tourists to weekending Philadelphians who own vacation homes in the posh communities of Longport and Margate. Indeed, while Atlantic City may not yet have as much star-chef wattage as Sin City – where renowned French chef Guy Savoy recently set up shop, joining luminaries like Daniel Boulud (Daniel Boulud Brasserie), Thomas Keller (Bouchon), Nobu Matsuhisa (Nobu), Joël Robuchon (Joël Robuchon at the Mansion, L'Atelier de Joël Robuchon) and a host of others – it does trump desert-bound Vegas in terms of easy access. More than a quarter of the nation's population is within a day's drive of A.C. It's a shade over two hours down the Garden State Parkway from New York City and an hour down the Atlantic City Expressway from Philly. Outside of the casinos, new dining choices for those heading to A.C. are decidedly more modest, with one exception. July Fourth weekend saw the debut of Sofia, a splashy Greek-Med downbeach in Margate. Not that everyone seeks out Atlantic City and environs for highbrow eats. The casinos, looking to lure Asian gamblers from New York, Philadelphia and the Far East, are even waging war over noodles. After the Atlantic City Hilton, the town's smallest casino, opened a reasonably priced noodle bar, Bally's Park Place, Borgata, Caesars, Showboat, Trump Taj Mahal and Tropicana followed suit. Texas Hold 'Em with a side of mai fun? Sounds like something even the Rat Pack could have gotten into.

The ABCs of BBQ

By Caren Weiner Campbell Summer calls for simple cooking and outdoor eating – with your hands, if possible. In other words, 'tis the season for barbecue. But while cooking a hunk of meat over fire may be one of the most basic forms of food prep known to man, the question of what constitutes bona fide authentic barbecue is no cinch to answer. Indeed, it's given rise to countless debates, books, cook-offs, symposia and no doubt a fistfight or two. In an effort to clear away some of the smoke surrounding the subject, we've put together a mini–barbecue primer, below, outlining the major regional styles of barbecue and what characterizes them. We've also compiled a list of some Barbecue Best Bets as rated by Zagat surveyors. Barbecue Best Bets Tuck into 'cue at these top spots. Barbecue Best Bets Before attempting to define what real barbecue is, it's helpful to rule out one thing that purists agree it isn't: slapping a steak on the rack of a Weber and sizzling it directly over a very hot flame, as legions of backyard meat flippers are doing at this time of year. That's known as \"grilling\" and is considered a different technique. In contrast, true barbecue – a noun, not a verb, as any Southerner would tell you – lives up to the old Mae West saying, \"Anything worth doing is worth doing slowly.\" According to experts such as Paul Kirk, a renowned Kansas City–based pitmaster (and self-styled \"Baron of BBQ\"), it's a large, tough cut of meat daubed with sauces or spices and cooked over indirect, low heat (230°–250° F) for many hours at a stretch. Coals – not charcoal, but incompletely burned bits of woods such as hickory, pecan, apple and mesquite – are usually used as fuel, with their smoke imparting a subtle flavoring even without seasoning. Other aspects to consider include the amount of smoke, along with the angle and speed at which it wafts over the meat. \"The heat, the seasoning and the smoke all work together,\" explains Kirk, a 'cue consultant/connoisseur and the co-owner of NYC's RUB BBQ. Beyond that, the debate about what's authentic begins, with many factors varying by locale: the preferred meat, the typical cut, the way it's sauced or seasoned. \"The best you can do is say that something is authentic for a particular region,\" emphasizes Kirk. \"Finding 'authentic' outside that region is an uphill battle.\" Whatever regional style a pitmaster may prefer, Kirk believes that the most important underlying principle is adherence to traditional, time-tested methods and pacing – a concept, he admits, that doesn't always go over well with chefs who may be fired up with contemporary culinary ambitions. \"I tell people, 'This is the procedure; don't deviate from it. Don't try to make it better. Do it this way and you'll get it right.'\" For those new to 'cue, here's a guide to finger-lickers' favorite styles. Style/region: Kansas City Preferred meat/cut: Almost any kind of meat is acceptable, but beef and pork ribs are favored. Also popular: \"burnt ends\" – the chewy, smoke-infused fragments trimmed from a beef brisket. Sauce/seasoning: During cooking, the slabs are basted with a thick, spicy-sweet tomato-based sauce. Etc.: The 6,000-member, nonprofit Kansas City Barbeque Society (www.kcbs.us) claims to be \"the world's largest organization of barbecue and grilling enthusiasts\"; the city itself is home to roughly 100 barbecue restaurants at any given time. Style/region: Memphis Preferred meat/cut: Pork, especially ribs. Sauce/seasoning: Made \"wet\" (basted and served with a tomato-and-vinegar-based sauce) or \"dry\" (rubbed with spices during and after cooking). Etc.: The annual \"Memphis in May\" World Championship Barbecue Cooking Contest (WCBCC) regularly draws thousands of pork lovers from around the globe (www.memphisinmay.org). Style/region: North Carolina (Eastern) Preferred meat/cut: Pork – typically a whole hog, cooked overnight. The meat is often pulled or chopped and served as a sandwich dressed with coleslaw. Sauce/seasoning: A hot, peppery, vinegar-based sauce, which is usually applied to the meat after it's pulled from the hog. Etc.: North Carolinians never use the term \"barbecue\" to refer to anything except slow-cooked pork; beef, chicken and other meats will never qualify. Style/region: North Carolina (Western) – aka Lexington-style Preferred meat/cut: Pork – typically pork shoulder, which is pulled or chopped after cooking. It's often served in chopped form in sandwiches or on platters. Sauce/seasoning: Basted and served with a sauce (or \"dip\") made of vinegar, ketchup, water, salt and pepper plus a touch of tomato sauce (the latter distinguishes it from Eastern NC–style sauce). Etc.: Slang terms pertaining to both Eastern and Western NC–style barbecue include \"Miss White\" (the lighter, moister meat deep inside the slab) and \"Mr. Brown\" (the dark, smoky surface meat). Style/region: South Carolina Preferred meat/cut: Pork, typically ribs. Sauce/seasoning: Basted and served with a mustard-based sauce sometimes called \"Carolina Gold.\" Etc.: Another smoky specialty of South Carolina is barbecue hash, a chopped mixture of pork, onions, vegetables and spices served over rice. Style/region: St. Louis Preferred meat/cut: Pork steak cut from the shoulder, or spareribs. Sauce/seasoning: A tomato-based sauce that's tangier and thinner than KC's, and may contain brown sugar, mustard and/or a dash of Worcestershire. Generally served on the side with ribs; pork steaks are often simmered in the sauce just before serving. Etc.: Daring diners may want to try another regional barbecue fave, \"crispy snoots\" (very well-done pig snouts). Style/region: Texas Preferred meat/cut: Usually beef (sliced brisket is common); sometimes sausage. Sauce/seasoning: Often cooked over mesquite wood and served with a tomato-based sauce thinned with vinegar and spiced up with hot peppers. Etc.: Texas-style brisket should have a pink ring around the edges of the meat – a result of chemical action during smoking.

Just in time for peak summer party season, the results of our first Hamptons Nightlife Survey are in, covering 53 bars and clubs as sampled by the East End's most avid socializers. From hot newcomers to longtime landmarks, beachy shacks to sleek lounges, we offer an insider's look at nightlife in one of the world's most fabled summer playgrounds. While heiresses and movie stars lend the Hamptons scene its paparazzi flash, that's not what appeals most to our seen-it-all respondents: 61% say the area's \"beach atmosphere\" is what they relish most, while its \"carefree party attitude\" is the prime draw for 31%. Only 4% fess up to digging \"celebrity sightings\" best of all. Other Highlights of Our Survey Findings: The American Hotel, a Sag Harbor landmark since 1846, took Most Popular honors and also ranked No. 1 for Decor and No. 2 for Appeal thanks to assets including a \"stellar\" wine list and \"beautiful-people\" crowd. The top Appeal rating went to Sunset Beach, a Shelter Island bistro with a \"Caribbean island feel\" and, yes, \"unreal sunset views.\" JL East, Ed \"Jean-Luc\" Kleefield's East Hampton French bistro, was the spot most visited by twentysomething surveyors, while thirtysomethings flocked to the Stephen Talkhouse in Amagansett for live music. People start the party early on the East End: 40 percent of respondents say they kick things off at happy hour and continue on from there. The libation of choice: martinis and other cocktails (favored by 46%), followed by wine (27%) and beer (17%). While 23% of Hamptons night owls have partaken of bottle service (buying a bottle of booze to score a table), 55% dismiss it as a waste of cash.

By Randi Gollin, ZAGAT.com staff editor With summer beckoning, chefs nationwide are answering the ice cream siren call, dreaming up enticing new flavors to cool off customers. But they're not just focusing on the sweet stuff – some are incorporating out-there ingredients and playing musical chairs with the menu, moving cold treats from the dessert column to other parts of the meal. A case in point: playful starters like red wine vinegar ice cream served with seared foie gras, beets, fennel and kumquats, and a hot or cold soup with thyme or lemon verbena ice cream, both concocted by chef David Myers at Sona in LA, which he co-owns with his wife, Michelle, a pastry chef and owner of the patisserie Boule. Myers' foray into uncharted frozen territory – Parmesan ice cream is another of his creations – has been a natural evolution over the past three and a half years, the result of \"experimenting and dabbling here and there.\" \"It's all about temperature, texture and flavor contrast,\" he explains, noting that ice cream's high fat content makes it a \"great medium\" for carrying flavors. Alberto Cabrera's olive bread sorbet tops heirloom tomato tartare and sardine escabèche at Karu&Y in Miami photo: Andrew Meade At Karu&Y, a sprawling restaurant, lounge and catering complex scheduled to open this summer in Miami's Arts District, chef Alberto Cabrera will kick the savory concept further off the grid, offering the likes of olive bread sorbet with heirloom tomato tartare and sardine escabèche. Cabrera's seviche will use Key lime sorbet for the requisite acidity. \"My style leans toward the movement that's going on in Spain,\" he explains. \"The Spanish bring the dessert side of the kitchen into the savory side and vice versa,\" an approach that Cabrera finds especially refreshing in a warm-weather locale like Miami. Sous-chef Shawn Darling and executive chef Christopher Daly of NYC's Aroma aren't necessarily El Bulli acolytes, but they do subscribe to the Mediterranean philosophy of using the freshest ingredients available, evident in palate cleansers like vanilla–olive oil sorbet (a takeoff, perhaps, on the famous olive oil gelato at NYC's Otto) or desserts like strawberry-avocado gelato. \"Certain combinations awaken new things in ingredients that you wouldn't expect,\" says Darling. \"You don't really taste the avocado – it just lends a creaminess. It's like eating a super-premium, super-fatty, rich strawberry gelato.\" Ever had a hankering for herring ice cream, or a bowl of mango–habanero pepper? Those were some of the \"shock-value\" flavors encountered by Megan O. Steintrager while writing East Coast Scoops (Happy Belly Guides), a road-tripper's guide to the cold stuff. Steintrager feels that those kinds of far-out flavors work best when they mirror \"savories that would be in a creamy presentation in a real-life dish,\" like the Nova lox version served at Max & Mina's, a kosher ice cream parlor in Queens, New York. When it comes to unexpected concoctions, few hold a spoon to Jon Snyder, founder and creator of NYC's Il Laboratorio del Gelato, who uses traditional Italian recipes as a jumping-off point for incorporating flavors inspired by his world travels. \"It's kind of the premise for the name of my company, being a laboratory where we can create new flavors,\" says Snyder. Visitors to the retail area of his Lower East Side shop can choose from 20 options, rotated weekly from a list of about 140 developed for restaurants. Indeed, many of Snyder's best efforts have been \"driven by chefs looking for unique flavors and really pushing my envelope with requests.\" Snyder's flavor 'resume' includes tarragon with pink peppercorns for a Pierre Hotel event; cherry blossom for EN Japanese Brasserie; and honey-lavender for Molyvos. Of course, his shop also sells \"an awful lot of vanilla and chocolate. That being said, we offer about eight different kinds of chocolate.\" Chef Martin Heierling of Sensi in Las Vegas' Bellagio Hotel is another ice cream innovator – but he declares himself \"no friend\" of savory versions. \"Are you doing pepper ice cream and all that stuff because it's cutting-edge? For me, it's hard to understand,\" says Heierling. Instead, he puts a twist on sweet treats via unusual ingredients like pandan leaf, which he encountered in Southeast Asia, where it's wrapped around chicken and meat for street food–style eats. Intrigued by its vanilla and nut flavor, Heierling decided it would make a perfect flavor base for ice cream. \"I'm not the guy who invented pandan ice cream – pandan has been around for hundreds and thousands of years,\" says Heierling. \"I'm just bringing it from a different culture and a different part of the world into my restaurant.\" Frozen custard aficionados hit the jackpot at NYC's Shake Shack Classic frozen desserts are also getting an update at the Shake Shack, Danny Meyer's über-popular fast-food destination in NYC's Madison Park. There, gourmet takes on frozen custard, floats and concretes (frozen custard with homemade mix-ins blended in) have been served up in flavors such as cinnamon toast (made with beurre noir) and banana brittle. \"We try not to mess around with them too much,\" says general manager Carla Lalli Music, who notes that even when dressed up in contemporary flavors, these old-timey treats touch \"that nostalgic side.\" And \"when you get into the total package with the burger and fries, that brings people back to their childhood,\" she says. Something that can't yet be said for the likes of red wine vinegar ice cream.

How Safe Is Your Seafood?

By Yoji Yamaguchi, ZAGAT.com staff editor \"Eating sushi has become the new Russian roulette.\" photo: MGM Grand A tart comment from a disgruntled Zagat surveyor? Not exactly. Those are the words of Eli Saddler of the public health advocacy group Gotmercury.org, whose controversial study was the subject of a March 6, 2006, Los Angeles Times story about the high levels of mercury found in seafood purchased at local restaurants. Gotmercury.org tested a total of 10 samples of tuna from five of the top Zagat-rated sushi restaurants in metro Los Angeles. According to their results, three of the samples contained levels of methylmercury (the organic form of mercury present in the Earth's waters) that the FDA deems unfit for consumption. The rest of the samples were significantly higher in methylmercury than the agency's established averages for those respective species of tuna. Highly toxic, methylmercury can damage nervous systems and cause profound disabilities in newborns. Because it can be especially harmful to young children and fetuses, the FDA and EPA recommend that women considering pregnancy, pregnant women, nursing mothers and young children avoid eating king mackerel, shark, swordfish or tilefish. These at-risk groups should eat no more than two six-ounce servings of seafood lower in mercury content, such as salmon, shrimp, catfish or canned light tuna, a week. Albacore (white) tuna should be limited to one serving per week. As nutrition and public health scholar Marion Nestle, author of the recently published What to Eat: An Aisle-to-Aisle Guide to Savvy Food Choices and Good Eating, notes, \"how much [methylmercury] it takes to cause visible harm is not known. If it is like lead, there is no safe level of intake.\" This uncertainty surrounding the potential risks of mercury has not been lost on the public. In a quick poll Zagat conducted shortly after the Times story ran, more than a third of respondents reported either cutting back on seafood or eliminating it from their diets altogether (see graphic below). Given that and the Gotmercury.org findings, what – if anything – can chefs do to ensure the safety of the seafood they serve? We talked to three noted seafood chefs to find out their reactions to the study and how they approach the issue. Mark Franz, chef/co-owner of San Francisco's Farallon, first became aware of the mercury warnings when he and his wife were expecting their now 16-year-old son. Her doctor advised her to limit her tuna consumption during pregnancy. According to Franz, his coastal cuisine menu reduces mercury levels by emphasizing smaller fish such as halibut. The higher you go up the food chain, the more methylmercury you find. Large predatory species with long life spans, such as shark or swordfish, have the highest levels of mercury, while smaller, shorter-lived fish and shellfish have the lowest. Also, because the species on his menu are relatively small, entree portions are not outsized and closer to FDA-recommended servings. \"You won't find any big slabs\" of fish on his tables, says Franz. Tuna is \"not totally taboo,\" but it's served \"only in small quantities,\" usually as an appetizer such as ahi tartare. In addition to offering safer seafood choices and portion control, restaurants are doing more to educate the public. California restaurants with 10 or more employees are required to post warning signs about the presence of harmful compounds such as mercury in the food they serve. Chefs are also taking the initiative by informing their colleagues and distributors. The Farallon staff is well versed in the mercury issue and can answer patrons' questions and make appropriate menu suggestions. Also, \"our buyers know our concerns and are careful\" in the seafood they select, says Franz. Cornelius Gallagher, executive chef of NYC's Oceana, echoes this sentiment. He feels his \"first responsibility is to provide quality, healthy fish from the best waters.\" Oceana purchases seafood from 19 purveyors all over the world. Gallagher has not modified his menu with mercury specifically in mind, but believes that \"if you follow quality, everything falls into line.\" But adopting such cautionary measures doesn't make these uncharted seas any easier to navigate. Rick Moonen, chef-owner of restaurant rm in Las Vegas, is a longtime proponent of sustainable cuisine. He was not surprised by the Times story. Mercury in fish is \"no news to me. It's about time everyone knew about it,\" he says. Still, Moonen points out, he's \"in the business of selling seafood.\" If he wanted to keep mercury off his menu, he notes wryly, \"I'd be selling tofu in 10 years.\" Simply put, mercury-free seafood does not exist on this planet. All sea creatures contain some amounts. And in any case, he thinks \"restaurants have no way of testing\" fish routinely. That may be true, but if three American companies have their way, certified low-mercury fish may someday join grass-fed beef and free-range chicken on the menus of fashionable restaurants. Earlier this year Sacramento-based Pacific Seafoods became the first wholesaler to begin testing fish for mercury at its warehouse, utilizing a computerized system called Safe Harbor, created by Micro Analytical Systems Inc. (MASI). Malcolm Wittenberg, CEO of MASI, says the Safe Harbor standards are stricter than the FDA's and only half of the fish tested pass muster. Those that do earn the Safe Harbor label. Rejected fish are still sold, but without the certification. The testing takes only minutes and costs $0.30 per test for each fish that gets the Safe Harbor label. At least two other businesses are marketing certified low-mercury seafood to consumers: Wild Planet of McKinleyville, CA, and the Portsmouth, NH–based EcoFish, a distributor of environmentally sustainable seafood. Would certified low-mercury seafood, like cage-free eggs, be sold at markup prices? For now, Holiday Markets, the California supermarket chain carrying the Safe Harbor line, is keeping the price of its low-mercury fish in line with non-certified fish. But a six-oz. can of Wild Planet minimal-mercury albacore tuna costs between $5.20 and $5.80. Of course, that tuna comes in medallions that are more presentable than your garden-variety chunk light. But it remains to be seen whether cost-conscious consumers will bite at the higher price tags of such products. Further complicating matters are the increasingly conflicted messages the public hears about seafood. Experts from the FDA to the American Heart Association agree that fish is an important part of a balanced diet, a rich source of nutrients such as protein and beneficial Omega-3 fatty acids. How do consumers square that information with the methylmercury risk? Twenty years ago, Steven Denning, chairman of the equity firm General Atlantic, thought he was making a healthy diet change by cutting out red meat and eating more fish. At one point, nearly half his meals included seafood. In 2004, however, his neurologist gave him startling news: the mercury level in his blood was three times higher than what is considered safe. After he swore off seafood for 18 months, the mercury is all but gone from his system and he doesn't appear to have suffered any lasting effects. Now the 57-year-old executive only eats small fish, such as Dover sole, twice a month. \"It's crazy that the government doesn't test fish\" for methylmercury, says Denning. Some critics still insist the very question of mercury is much ado about nothing. Congressmen Richard Pombo (R-CA) and Jim Gibbons (R-NV) charge that environmentalists have \"shamelessly used [the EPA/FDA] fish advisories to further their political agenda\" of regulating mercury emissions from power plants, and that \"scaring people away from consuming fish is creating a public health crisis in its own right.\" Still, in Marion Nestle's view, until we know more about the effects of low-level exposure to methylmercury, \"avoiding fish containing it seems like a good idea, especially for groups that are most vulnerable – [pregnant women] and young children. The EPA and FDA standards seem like a reasonable compromise between complete avoidance and anything goes.\" Resources Sam Roe and Michael Hawthorne, \"Toxic Risk on Your Plate\" in Chicago Tribune, December 11, 2005, http://www.chicagotribune.com/chi-mercury-3-story,1,6231518.story \"Seafood FAQs April 2004: Methylmercury Poses Conundrum for Consumers\" in SeaFood Business News, http://www.seafoodbusiness.com/archives/searchframe.asp.

By Olga Boikess Long hours and hazardous, back-breaking work in a macho environment are just some of the challenges facing women working in professional kitchens. Those who rise to the top – running their own restaurants and catering companies, starring in TV shows, writing cookbooks – face even more demanding schedules and responsibilities. So imagine what happens when you add having a family into the mix. Some of the industry's most talented chefs are also proud mothers (and grandmothers). How do they juggle their roles – and deal with the guilt – when family and work obligations collide? And what do their children eat? In honor of fast-approaching Mother's Day (May 14th), we talked to six stellar chefs to find out how they've managed to rock both the culinary world and the cradle. Lidia Bastianich photo: Christopher Hirsheimer Lidia Bastianich, whose illustrious dining empire includes Felidia, Becco, Esca and Del Posto in Manhattan plus Lidia's in Kansas City and Pittsburgh, says that \"all children want is happy parents.\" That philosophy sustained her as she raised two children while pursuing her passion for food by working full-time in her restaurants. Still, Bastianich admits that she found herself worrying about not being able to 'do it all' when she had her second child while running one of the family's early ventures in Forest Hills, NY. What got her through it? Her own mother's support – she took care of the children after school and later worked with Bastianich at Felidia – as well as \"planning and setting rules\" for her kids. Clearly, Bastianich succeeded in nurturing not only a successful career but strong family bonds as well: her son, Joseph, is now a partner in the business and her grown daughter, Tanya, is involved too. Bastianich will celebrate Mother's Day this year at a festive meal for the extended family – including her five grandchildren – in one of the clan's restaurants, most likely enjoying a menu featuring seasonal ingredients and a baked pasta. And even now, she continues to strive to balance home and work – for example, getting up before dawn to make breakfast with a visiting grandaughter before leaving for an out-of-town charity event, much as she did in years gone by, when she would arrive home in the wee hours from her restaurant and then rise early to get her children off to school. Gale Gand photo: Tim Turner Gale Gand, executive pastry chef and partner in Chicago's acclaimed Tru restaurant, waited until she was nearly 40 to have her son, Gio (short for Giorgio), now nine. She also has one-and-a-half-year-old twin daughters, Ella Nora and Ruby Grace. The fact that Gand was \"always opening a restaurant\" helps explain her relatively late arrival to motherhood. \"If I had it to do over, I would have had my children sooner,\" she says. Gand's career is still at full boil. Besides Tru, she's been involved in TV and cookbook projects and will help to open four more restaurants this year: Osteria di Tramonto, Tramonto's Steak & Seafood, RT Lounge and Gale's Coffee Bar, all in a new Westin hotel slated to open in Wheeling this fall. Yet she usually manages to be at home (in the woods 30 miles from Chicago) for at least part of the day in order to \"create the memory\" of a mother who cooks dinner for her kids. One of Gand's secrets for carving out home time is \"training restaurant staff to replace\" her by \"empowering\" them to make decisions on their own. Another is her husband's involvement in family life. On Mother's Day, she and her son – a \"great eater\" who enjoys everything from choucroute to greens – and the rest of the family will celebrate the holiday as they have for the past eight years, by going to a nursery to select the herbs, heirloom tomatoes and other plants (\"maybe eggplant this year?\") they'll grow in their garden – some of which may make it onto the tables at Tru. Debbie Gold photo: Ron Berg Debbie Gold and her chef-husband, Michael Smith, run their highly regarded Kansas City restaurant, 40 Sardines, like a tag team – that way each one can spend as much time as possible with their daughters, Misha and Sophie (ages eight and six, respectively), while the girls are \"still willing to hang out\" with them. The hardest part of combining parenting and running a restaurant, says Gold, is \"getting over the guilt.\" Neither wanted a full-time nanny because then it \"would be too easy\" to work late. So one or the other is usually home to make dinner for the kids – they \"love crudités!\" notes Gold, as well as pasta and rice. Come Mother's Day, there'll be no leisurely breakfast in bed for Gold – since 40 Sardines will be open for brunch, she'll arrive at the restaurant at 6 or 7 AM and leave at 2 or 3 PM. Then she'll do something special with the kids, like catching a movie or going to the park. Smith will work a later shift at the restaurant and join them for dinner, but they'll leave the cooking to someone else and head to a Thai or sushi place. When Gold does make a meal at home, her kids join in – she's \"not a 'don't touch' person,\" says Gold, whose advice for other working women is to \"make time for quality family time. It's good for children to understand what hard work is,\" she says, but it's also critical to \"make sure your family knows they're an important part of your life as well.\" Traci Des Jardins photo: Frankie Frankeny Traci Des Jardins, chef-owner of the San Francisco standouts Jardinière and Mijita, and managing chef of Acme Chophouse, says she has had to \"wean her restaurants off\" making constant demands on her time during the two days a week she devotes to her six-year-old son, Eli. Admittedly, doing so is \"really hard\" since her career is running full blast, but Des Jardins points to \"prioritizing,\" as well as the support of family and friends, as the keys that allow her to find time to focus on him. Though all her restaurants will be open on Mother's Day, Des Jardins will most likely be touring a farmer's market with Eli, buying food for the dinner she'll make for him and their family and friends that night. Des Jardins describes Eli as a \"picky\" eater who'll nibble on things like parsley or cilantro while they shop the market, but don't even think about getting him to eat the likes of cooked broccoli with a meal – pleasing his palate is a \"challenge,\" even for this accomplished chef. Barbara Lynch Barbara Lynch had hit it big professionally, running her successful No. 9 Park and having just opened B&G Oysters and The Butcher Shop, all in Boston, when her daughter, Marchesa, now two, was born. While Lynch was devoted to her career, she also didn't want to miss having a family – so the answer for her was to get even \"more organized\" to \"make it work.\" Having a supportive husband was important too. While a nanny tends to Marchesa during the day, he takes over at 5 PM, often bringing the budding bec fin (who loves gnocchi with Mimolette cheese) to No. 9 Park for supper. Lynch usually spends Sundays at home, making a few check-in calls to her restaurants, but this Mother's Day, No. 9 Park will be open for a special brunch and she plans to be there, \"showing off\" her child to her regular clientele between stints in the kitchen. Nora Pouillon Nora Pouillon, chef-owner of Nora and Asia Nora in Washington, DC, and a champion of organic cuisine, is the mother of four (her daughters Nadia and Nina are now 16 and 19, respectively, and her sons Olivier and Alexis are 35 and 37) and has been working in the restaurant business since the oldest was eight. During their childhood, a babysitter would bring them to her restaurant for an early organic dinner – with a side order of homework help. On Sundays, she'd bring home \"what needed to be used up\" from the restaurant's larder and cook a family meal. For Pouillon, the loving support of her partner (in business and life) has made a huge difference in her ability to mesh motherhood with a career. But Pouillon won't have to worry about the job this Mother's Day – her restaurants are shuttered on Sundays and holidays, so this year, as usual, there will be a big family gathering (most likely a swimming party) at her home, with everyone pitching in to cook the meal together. You can bet that organic ingredients will figure prominently on the menu.

By Daniel Paul Simmons III, ZAGAT.com staff editor Alice Waters, a tireless crusader in the greening of America's tables, has long championed a cuisine incorporating fresh, ripe, seasonal produce. Her revolutionary restaurant, Chez Panisse, has helped foment a sea change in Americans' perception of the importance of biodiversity and sustainable farming practices – an awareness that's increasingly reflected on menus from coast to coast, in which the pedigree and provenance of ingredients are now a central part of dishes' descriptions. \"The most important job in our restaurant,\" Waters once said, \"is finding these ingredients.\" To realize her vision, she spent decades creating a network of growers whose farms dot the California countryside near her legendary establishment. Today, some top restaurateurs are taking Waters' philosophy a step further, creating their own proprietary gardens in which they themselves nurture some or all of the fruits, vegetables and herbs used in their kitchens. With spring budding across the country, we recently talked to a handful of these industrious gourmets to learn what they're planting this year, how they plan to use what they grow and what advice they have for amateur gardeners. Red Swiss chard photo: Paulette Satur, courtesy of Satur Farms Eberhard Müller, executive chef at Bayard's in Downtown Manhattan, divides his time between his kitchen and Satur Farms in Cutchogue, on the North Fork of Long Island, which he co-owns with wife Paulette Satur. What do you plant? Ours is not your typical restaurateur's backyard garden. It's 200 acres, 160 of which are cultivated. Even now we're pulling a lot out of our greenhouses, typical spring products like micro greens, pea shoots. And we're getting ready to plant the fields. We already seeded spinach and arugula, and weather permitting we'll start on the lettuces and root crops soon. In times gone by, Long Island was the main source of produce for the New York area, so we're trying to revive local vegetable sourcing for the city of New York. In addition to our own needs, we supply a lot of the major restaurants in the tri-state area: Daniel, Jean Georges, Craft, Babbo, Picholine and many others. Chefs want baby vegetables these days, so you have to harvest them at an early stage. Then we have all the culinary herbs, including some obscure things. A few years ago I said to my wife, \"I think we can grow lemongrass,\" and she said, \"You're crazy.\" But we tried it and it worked. How do you use what you grow? The most important aspect to what I'm doing as a chef is that I respect the true seasonality of the crops. You will not find tomatoes in any shape or form on my menu if our tomatoes are not in season. I'm not one of those guys who preaches seasonality and then cooks white asparagus in December. It limits you to a certain extent, but on the other hand it challenges your creativity. Tip for gardeners? Grow things that you know will grow well in your area, and grow things that you're familiar with. Or if you're not familiar with something then read up on it or talk to the specialists. In other words, focus on things that are feasible, and be true to Mother Nature. We try to force Nature all the time, but sometimes it's easier and more beneficial to all of us if we work with her and not try to trick her.

What do you plant? What do you plant? We grow a lot of perennial herbs such as orange balsam thyme, lemon thyme, caraway thyme, plus many others, and all sorts of scented geraniums and lavender, which we incorporate into various dishes, as well as some vegetables. In our two-acre garden, we plant a half-acre of zucchini, mainly for the flowers, which we use in many dishes. But if you've ever grown zucchini, you know how quickly it takes over, so even though we harvest the flowers about three times a week we still end up with three-ft. zucchinis, most of which go to local food banks. Now we're getting into the warmer, drier time of year, so we're putting in lots of lettuces. We also use some wild plants, such as miner's lettuce, a wild green, and shot weed or pepper grass – when you touch it the seeds shoot into your face! How do you use what you grow? Our head gardener's name is EagleSong, and her basic tenet is that the way to control weeds is to eat them. So there's a number of volunteer plants that we incorporate into our menu. This time of year we have lovage; it's a perennial that comes back up in the spring, at the same time that the wild stinging nettles come up in the woods. So we often incorporate them together. For instance, right now we're wrapping Alaska king salmon in nettle leaves, slow roasting it then serving it with a lovage sauce. In the winter, we make a sorbet out of the Douglas fir, the state tree of Washington, and it's really delicious. Tip for gardeners? Eat your weeds! Hakurei turnip photo: Blue Hill at Stone Farms Jack Algiere holds the title of Four Season Grower at the Stone Barns Center for Food & Agriculture in Pocantico Hills, New York, where he oversees a half-acre in-soil greenhouse and four acres of garden that deliver fresh produce to chef-owner Dan Barber's restaurants, Blue Hill at Stone Barns on-site and Blue Hill in Greenwich Village. What do you plant? We base our production on specialty items, especially things we can't find at market. Some of these things may sound normal, but what we're providing is a micro [version] so we can use the whole plant: baby fennel, baby bok choy, baby carrots, hakurei turnips, which are a Japanese turnip. They're very different, very sweet and soft. Of course, we do a lot of large crops too – broccoli, cauliflower, onions, new potatoes, winter and summer squashes, heirloom tomatoes. In our greenhouses during the winter, we grow micro salad greens, spinach and mustard greens, fennel, chervil, parsley, as well as broccoli, radish, sunflower and pea sprouts. We grow over 40 varieties [of vegetables] and more than 1,000 plants. We can provide enough for the restaurants, but we also provide for the public – some go to markets and some to the local CSA [Community Supported Agriculture]. How do you use what you grow? The wonderful part of working with Dan [Barber] is that he's very passionate about seasonal crops. So when it's tomato season, they show up all over the menu. The [hakurei] turnip is really the one that's been the most daring for him, and it's been a huge success. He often serves it raw: basically cuts off the tap root, puts some nice sea salt around the base and stands it up. And because it's fresh, the greens are still upright and alive, so its stands up like it does in the soil. It's nice to go into a fancy restaurant and see something served like that; it's almost primal in a way. Tip for gardeners? We're finding the sweetness of the crops is increasing because of the quality of the compost we're adding. Instead of feeding the plants with fertilizer, we feed the organisms in the soil, increasing its biodiversity and allowing for better breakdown of nutrients. Start with good material: leaves, straw, practically any vegetable material except wood, plus egg and seafood shells. Use materials that weren't sprayed, because pesticides impede organism growth. Turn it regularly to keep the biological action up. Sink a nice, deep compost thermometer in there and raise it to 140 degrees, because at that temperature you're killing any pathogens and seeds. Most important: pick a date to stop adding raw material or it'll never finish. The USDA has created its own guidelines, which are a good way to get started.

What do you plant? Actually, I just got in from tilling the plot. We're planting now for later harvests of broccoli, cauliflower, radish, arugula and onions. In the summer, we'll plant hot peppers, as well as a good amount of heirloom zucchini, both for fruit and the blossoms. We can't grow all of what we use, but for me it's more for the seasonal rhythm from which I build a menu – a connection of sorts to our local, seasonal approach to cooking. How do you use what you grow? I have a large stinging nettle patch that is really fragrant this time of year. We use that to make nettle gnocchi as well as a spring greens ravioli with green garlic and petit-gris snails. The second dish features the garlic we planted in October, picked now before the bulb forms. We don't harvest all of the garlic; some is left in, which will give us garlic scapes [stalks] a little later on. We use these mainly for pickling, as the curly look lends a dramatic flair to the assorted pickle garnish on the Cafe Burger. And our fig tree supplies us with leaves for steaming fish, and some figs in a good year. Tip for gardeners? Some of the vegetables I grow are from heirloom seeds passed along from friends and family, mostly with origins in Italy. We save seeds from selected healthy looking specimens and continue the cycle every year – a library of seeds, each with a different story. Some go back as far as I can remember, from my grandfather's garden. So seek out heirloom varieties, fine tune the collection to suit you, save seeds for the next year and pass them along.

What do you plant? It's about a 1,500-sq.-ft. garden, so it can't supply all the vegetables for the restaurant, but we do grow beets, red and green chard, garden cress, spinach, a variety of peppers and heirloom tomatoes. We also do unusual herbs such as bay leaf; lemongrass; flax; epazote, a pungent wild herb used in Mexican cooking; five varieties of oregano, including Kent Beauty oregano, which looks like a flower; five different varieties of lavender; savory, which is in the mint family and is reminiscent of thyme crossed with mint; lemon and licorice verbena; Vietnamese coriander; hops. Right now we're planting edible flowers, such as pansies, which work well in cooler weather. And then we also have strawberries, which grow really well. I could easily have a whole strawberry field growing on my roof. How do you use what you grow? We have a pistou, a sort of a peasant soup from Nice, that's made with white beans and a pesto; when it's in season, the basil in the pesto comes from the garden. We use pansies as garnishes, and last summer we had an edible flowers salad. We use our lavenders in our organic cocktails, to infuse vodka. Our Counter Cosmo is made with lavender- and rosemary-infused vodka and cranberry nectar, and then it's garnished with a spear of rosemary used as a skewer for cranberries and blueberries, and then the server lights the top of the rosemary. Tip for gardeners? The biggest gardening tip is to give your plants love, like they're children. If you yell at them, they're going to shrivel up. But if you love them, they're going to just blossom. Organic lettuces in the Ryland Inn's onsite garden photo: Richard Gorman Photography Craig Shelton is chef and proprietor of The Ryland Inn in Whitehouse, New Jersey, which is surrounded by 50 hilly acres in the heart of the state's hunting region, approximately three acres of which is dedicated to the restaurant's garden. What do you plant? I had worked at an idyllic French restaurant, L'Auberge de L'Ile. Back in 1990, when I was first looking for a place, I said to myself, \"The fish and meats and fowl here compare to what I worked with in France, but the vegetables are still light years away.\" So I felt the best way to advance the cuisine was to have my own garden where everything was grown in the French artisanal way. We were one of the first major restaurant gardens in America, and we've been organic for 13 years. From about May through mid-November, we're pretty much self-sufficient. Every year we've grown 800 or 900 different things, like 25 different types of basil. Generally we have 200, 300 different herbs growing; same for vegetables. A lot of cutting flowers too. What's different this year is that my cuisine has been taking a Japanese-French direction, so we're exploring a host of Japanese things like sansho [a mildly hot seasoning made from the dried-and-ground berries of the prickly ash tree] and shiso [an annual Asian herb belonging to the mint family]. How do you use what you grow? One of the best dishes we do is simply our baby lettuces. It may be 20 or 30 different types of lettuces and herbs, all cut to the right size, with a white-truffle vinaigrette and boom: just let nature speak for itself. You can't beat it. It's the way we all should be eating – so much healthier, so much more flavorful, so much more life on the plate. Tip for gardeners? Grow soil, not plants. Think that way: \"I'm growing soil.\" We do intensive French planting – we never turn the soil, just layer upon layer that build over the years. And we rotate crops. No pesticides whatsoever. Intensive irrigation. We have grass planted in between the rows to keep the moisture in the ground because everything grows more easily in super-healthy soil. Take care of the soil and it takes care of everything else.

Gastropubs Pour It On

By Carol Diuguid, ZAGAT.com staff editor When the Mario Batali–backed eatery The Spotted Pig arrived in Manhattan two years ago calling itself a gastropub, it was the first time many diners on this side of the Atlantic had heard this British-coined, vaguely medical-sounding term. But as gastropubs have continued to crop up around the U.S. – the newest include Ford’s Filling Station in LA, Spike Hill in NYC and an upcoming San Francisco entry from the folks behind Town Hall, due to open in early summer – this less-than-sexy word is catching on (sort of). Philly's Standard Tap is housed in a 200-year-old tavern building Derived from melding “gastronomy” and “pub,” it essentially means a casual watering hole serving high-quality food. The Eagle in London is considered the progenitor of the breed; it opened in 1991 in an old pub building whose new owners followed a simple formula: serving expertly prepared but unpretentious fare in hip, laid-back, convivial environs. It was an instant hit that has since been replicated in every corner of the U.K., including several other London standouts such as Anchor & Hope and The Cow. Gastropubs come in all flavors – they’re as likely to serve dishes with Italian, Thai or Indian influences as traditional English ones – but the best share an emphasis on top-notch ingredients and straightforward preparations. In terms of atmosphere, they’re not so different from that beloved British institution, the neighborhood pub. And though they’ve elevated the food, they’ve left the heart of the pub tradition intact: “The bar is the focal point,” explains Spotted Pig chef (and English expat) April Bloomfield. The bar is the focal point of The Spotted Pig in Manhattan Indeed, with its fare designed to complement the brews on tap, the gastropub has been called Britain’s answer to the French brasserie. And U.S. establishments are following suit on the suds front. The Spotted Pig features top-notch craft brews and “tries to get people to focus on the beer,” says Bloomfield. LA’s rollicking Father’s Office and Philadelphia’s Standard Tap, housed in a 200-year-old tavern building, are doing the same. The Standard pours 13 varieties of local brews, all on tap, and adheres to a philosophy for both food and drink that, says co-owner William Reed, can be summed up in three words: “fresh, local and seasonal.” It recently spawned a Philly sibling, Johnny Brenda’s, and may have provided inspiration for another like-minded local, N. 3rd. While the gastropub moniker may be fairly new to the U.S. dining public, the concepts behind it are not – they’re firmly in keeping with “what’s been happening for a long time: Americans understanding that they can go to a casual restaurant for the food, rather than just to feed,” notes restaurant historian Michael Batterberry. Even places that you might not think of as a gastropub – Batterberry cites NYC’s Prune, for one – are “wonderful examples” of that general trend, i.e. informal places that “use better ingredients, use regionally grown foods, have more polished skills in the kitchen and offer more imaginative menus with more varied choices.” In fact, Batterberry sees the current gastropub vogue as an instance of Americans “borrowing an Englishism to lend luster” to an otherwise familiar package, one that “goes back to the very roots” of American restaurant dining – “in essence, taverns.” The more things change, the more they stay the same. Just brace yourself for the next step in the gastro revolution: gastrobistros, now taking hold in France and sure to cross the ocean any minute.

By Carol Diuguid, ZAGAT.com staff editor Las Vegas locals are fools for love, French is the sexiest cuisine and if you haven't made reservations yet, better start dialing. Those are among the conclusions to be drawn from our special Valentine's Day Survey. Given that the big day for romance is also one of the year's biggest days for restaurants, we felt it our duty to uncover the facts about how people celebrate: what they spend, how far in advance they plan and which qualities make for the most seductive meals. We also attempted to do the admittedly impossible: take the amorous temperature of various cities by examining local attitudes toward the holiday (see box below). Overall, the Survey revealed something that should warm the hearts of cynics: only 26% of the 1,640 people who responded declared themselves to be unabashed fans of Valentine's Day. \"Amateur hour\" is how 39% view it, while 19% think it should be abolished and 16% shrug it off as just another day. Still, whether out of genuine enthusiasm or a desire to avoid the doghouse, legions are making plans for February 14th. Read on for more insights from our Survey, which was sent to a national sample of registered ZAGAT.com users. Big Spenders: Respondents plan to spend an average of about $100 per person on V-Day dinner, with under-35s spending the least (about $92) and 35–49ers the most (about $109). Role Reversal: It's not necessarily the man who has to foot the bill – 57% of women and 46% of men say it's whoever did the inviting. Real Men Do Cook: More men than women (39% vs. 28%) would prefer to cook a nice meal at home for V-Day, and – conveniently enough – more women than men (19% vs. 9%) want someone to cook a meal for them. (The jury's still out on who will do the dishes...) Cuisine Themes: French is considered the most romantic cuisine (especially if served in a cozy bistro), chosen by 44% of voters vs. runner-up Italian's 22%. Fondue, tapas and anything \"you can share\" or \"eat with your hands\" also earned mentions. And surprise: more women than men think steak is sexy. P.S. In case you need to be told, pub grub and molecular gastronomy don't cut it in the romance department. Early Birds: Forty-three percent of respondents think V-Day dinner reservations should be made three or more weeks in advance, and another 30% say one or two weeks ahead. Those who like to live dangerously (3%) would leave it till the day before, while 7% would take their chance and just walk in. Recipe for Romance: Top factors that make a restaurant romantic: a quiet atmosphere (cited by 64%), soft lighting (53%) and beautiful views (37%). Other desirables: attentive, discreet service, \"space between tables\" and \"a sense of privacy.\" And of course, \"no one nearby with chest hairs and tank tops.\" Liquid Weapons: Wine (with 51% of the vote) beats champagne (24%) and other libations as the preferred alcoholic aphrodisiac. Love at First Sight? Thirteen percent of respondents would celebrate Valentine's Day with a person they just met, while 74% need three or more dates with someone before they'll commit to the big day. Love-Struck Locales: Las Vegas tops our \"Sizzle Meter\" index (see box above); its residents most frequently identified themselves as \"fools for romance\" who believe Valentine's Day never loses its importance in a relationship. They're also most likely to follow up a V-Day dinner with a gift. Los Angelenos also know how to seal a deal: they're most likely to \"make a beeline for the bedroom\" after the meal. And as you might guess, New Yorkers are most likely to view the holiday as an \"overly commercial rip-off\" – maybe that's why they're also most likely to \"wind up fighting with my partner\" after the meal.

By Randi Gollin, ZAGAT.com staff editor Now that celeb decorators and architects have become as de rigueur as superstar chefs for high-end restaurants, it's only fitting that fashion designers should follow suit. Big-label names jump-started the trend a while back, with Giorgio Armani outfitting staffers at Armani/Nobu in Milan and Todd Oldham doing the same at Wish at The Hotel in Miami Beach, and they show no sign of stopping: in New York City, Narciso Rodriguez whipped up striking outfits for Del Posto, the just-opened Batali-Bastianich venture, while the team behind the relaunched Norman Norell New York line stepped up to the plate at Sascha, chef Sascha Lyon's upcoming Meatpacking District restaurant/bar/bakery. Left to Right: Designs for Del Posto (Narciso Rodriguez); Wish (Todd Oldham); Sascha (Norman Norell New York) Perry Street staff dressed in Calvin Klein Alinea chef-owner Grant Achatz in Z. Zegna Yeohlee-clad servers in The Modern's bar room photo: Quentin Badcon Bong Su hostesses will sport this sexy Calvin Tran tunic with pants, rather than hotpants Hipster labels are hot too. NYC's Bette crew wears Earnest Sewn jeans, staffers at LA hot spots Bella and Geisha House don edgy Petro Zillia creations and Vietnamese designer Calvin Tran is dressing servers in silk tuxedo jackets and hostesses in slinky backless tunics at San Francisco's Bong Su, a sibling of Palo Alto's Tamarine opening in late February. The increased focus on uniforms makes sense given that design and style \"matter more now than ever before,\" says Lois Freedman, director of operations for Jean-Georges Vongerichten's restaurants, including his latest NYC venture, Perry Street. Dining out is no longer just about what's for dinner; it's about the mix of \"food, service and atmosphere,\" Freedman notes. In keeping with Perry Street's 1960s vibe, Freedman opted to go \"back to basics and keep it really simple, but really chic,\" turning to designer Kevin Carrigan of Calvin Klein, who came up with smart black trousers and white shirts, worn with neckerchiefs for women and skinny black ties for men. A very different look was required at Vongerichten's Asian-themed Spice Market in NYC's Meatpacking District. There, the call went to a lesser-known designer, Alpana Bawa, who created sexy Indian-inspired, open-backed tops for female staffers. Grant Achatz, chef-owner of Chicago's innovative Alinea, wanted uniforms that would \"uphold the image of the decor\" – i.e. \"very sleek and modern, yet very luxurious.\" He chose Ermenegildo Zegna's spin-off line, Z. Zegna. \"When the service team puts on those suits, they gain confidence because they feel they look good and they're comfortable,\" Achatz explains. While restaurateurs want uniforms to make a statement, few are looking to leave diners thinking \"'wow, what a crazy dress she had on,'\" notes Kristina O'Neal, one of the principals behind AvroKO, a cutting-edge design-and-concept firm that created the look for several NYC hot spots (Odea, Sapa, Stanton Social) as well as its own restaurant, Public.

What the Pros Want in 2006

By Carla Spartos with ZAGAT.com editors See What the Pros are Saying: We Need More We Could Do With Less Resolved: There'll be more space between tables, diners will keep those BlackBerries out of sight and Anthony Bourdain will get his fill of baby cuttlefish. Or at least that's how things would be if certain industry insiders got their wish in 2006. We asked chefs, sommeliers, nightlife gurus and other mavens what they'd like to see more of – and less of – in the New Year. No surprise, more high-quality seasonal ingredients was a common theme (cited by the likes of Gordon Ramsay, Richard Farnabe of NYC's Montrachet and Rainer Becker of London's Zuma, among others), as was better service (cited by Joël Robuchon, Tracy Wilson of NYC's Tabla and David Myers of LA's Sona, among others). Following are other wishes that just might come true – and thus influence what you'll be experiencing in restaurants and nightspots in the year ahead. We Need More: \"Wine bars. Real tapas. Local wines and products. Artisanal cheese. Sustainable foods. Chef-driven restaurants. Inspired local neighborhood restaurants. Outdoor spaces. Passion.\" – Michael Franks, co-owner, LA's Chez Melange \"Authentic Vietnamese. Decent Mexican food. Real tapas bars. Baby cuttlefish. Yakitori joints like in Tokyo. Smoking sections. Casual Malaysian. Offal.\" – Anthony Bourdain, executive chef, Brasserie Les Halles in NYC and elsewhere \"Wonderful, quality rice like the one out of Japan called Koshihikari. It's the highest rated sushi rice. It makes a difference.\" – Ming Tsai, chef-owner, Boston's Blue Ginger \"Fusion. Pushing the edge. Experimentation. People who understand the rules of sushi [but who don't] worry about breaking the rules of sushi.\" – Travis Kamiyama, chef-owner, LA's Kotosh at Kamiyama \"Smaller portions of wonderful food. Quality fruits and vegetables. Great chocolate and butterscotch pudding and cheesecake made with natural ingredients instead of soft drinks and other processed sweets.\" – Mark Furstenberg, owner/chief baker, DC's Bread Line \"Regional cooking. The Hudson Valley, for example, is totally underrated as a resource for great ingredients, and it is capable of exploding any day.\" – Gray Kunz, chef-owner, NYC's Café Gray \"Restaurants [in London] that are open later – from 6 PM till midnight or 1 AM.\" – Tom Aikens, chef-owner, London's Tom Aikens \"Tableside service.\" – Michael Mina, chef-owner, San Francisco's Michael Mina and others \"Customers who aren't afraid to ask sommeliers [for] advice.\" – Dawn Davies, sommelier, London's The Ledbury \"Places with heart. Too many establishments are just trying to suck the money out of your wallet.\" – Tracy Westmoreland, owner, NYC's Siberia and Bellevue Bar \"Service that's knowledgeable about the food [and] not just going through the motions. If I have that, the food doesn't have to jump up off the plate.\" – Rick Bayless, chef-owner, Chicago's Frontera Grill and Topolobampo \"Menu diversification – it seems as if everyone has the same menu these days. Also a more experimental dining public – people who will let chefs work outside the box and support their efforts.\" – Amy Knoll, co-owner/general manager, LA's Grace \"Support for smaller farms, sustainable agriculture and artisanal food – if restaurants are more conscious about the world we live in, our impact on the way food is produced can be huge.\" – Karen and David Waltuck, owners (David is chef) of NYC's Chanterelle \"Organically produced wine. Waiters in nice, crisp Spencer jackets.\" – Daniel Boulud, chef-owner, NYC's Daniel and others We Could Do With Less: \"Of the exact same songs in every club. People furiously texting their friends at other places.\" – David Rabin, co-owner, NYC's Double Seven and Lotus \"Description [on menus]. I don't necessarily need to know the names of the rocks the greens were grown in [or the] farmers that tilled the soil. I don't want to see any more flavored beers. I think less salsa would be good for this planet. I'm a fan of mango salsa but you go to a food show and there are more salsas than people in China.\" – Ming Tsai, chef-owner, Boston's Blue Ginger \"Tables for two that are both narrow and long, placing you far away from your guest and too close to the strangers on either side of you. Restaurants do this to fit more tables in but it's a shortsighted strategy for building repeat business.\" – Danny Meyer, co-owner of NYC's The Modern and others \"Truffle oil. \"Fusion.\" Water sommeliers. Overdesigned dining rooms. Mayonnaise on sushi. \"Concept\" restaurants. Novelty martinis.\" – Anthony Bourdain, executive chef, Brasserie Les Halles in NYC and elsewhere \"Crème brûlée – whether I'm at a French, American or Italian restaurant, I cannot see the crème brûlée any more!\" – MRichard Farnabe, chef, NYC's Montrachet \"[Nothing.] It's an exciting time in American food and I want more of all of it.\" – Rick Bayless, chef-owner, Chicago's Frontera Grill and Topolobampo \"Endangered species like swordfish and Iranian caviar [on menus].\" – Karen and David Waltuck, owners (David is chef), NYC's Chanterelle \"Sloppy drinkers – primal, hooting sounds are always a good indicator. Dirty bars and barware. A staff that makes you feel like it's doing you a favor by serving you.\" – Audrey Saunders, owner-mixologist, NYC's Pegu Club \"Truffle oil – it seems to have become ubiquitous and often used inappropriately.\" – Gordon Ramsay, chef-owner, London's Gordon Ramsay and others \"Actresses posing as hostesses. Bouncers and doormen at trendy eateries – if they need a bouncer it's not a restaurant and definitely not about the food. BlackBerries at the table. Places where the music is louder than the crowd. Less white truffle oil and fewer white truffles in the hands of amateurs who don't know how to use them.\" – Daniel Boulud, chef-owner, NYC's Daniel and others \"Hollywood. Steakhouses. [High-priced] sides. Bad Italian restaurants. Investors. Formula restaurants. Government interference. Rachael Ray.\" – Michael Franks, co-owner, LA's Chez Melange \"People charging me for beer [laughs]. Dress codes – but there's already less of that. But seriously, how can you have any gripes? In NYC, it's your own damned fault if you don't go out to eat somewhere that makes you happy.\" – Josh DeChellis, chef, NYC's Jovia and Sumile \"Small-plate (i.e. shared-plate) menus.\" – Chris Gerber, maitre d', Chicago's Alinea

Call it the plane truth: The results of our latest Airline Survey are in, painting a vivid portrait of passenger discontent in the skies. While a few carriers stood out as doing a commendable job despite the turbulence buffeting the industry – Midwest Airlines, JetBlue and Song (which is being discontinued next year) domestically and Singapore, Emirates and Cathay Pacific internationally – ratings were generally down across the board. Overall, surveyors reported that flying has reached \"new lows\" as financially ailing airlines resort to \"nickel and diming\" passengers to make ends meet. Within the U.S. domestic ranks, the biggest declines were posted by the biggest names: American, Delta, United and US Airways all saw their overall ratings drop by about five to six points on the Zagat 30-point scale from the ratings they received in our last survey four years ago. Even top-rated Midwest experienced a dip. And though performance on international flights generally outscored domestic travel – logically enough, given that longer trips typically call for bigger, more comfortable aircraft and at least some semblance of meals and service – even here most carriers saw substantial ratings dips. Not surprisingly, food was the category in which airlines earned their lowest ratings, domestically averaging a score of 9. Embarrassingly, airlines generally scored better for their Web sites than for any aspect of their performance in the air. As one surveyor put it, it's \"too bad you can't fly the Web site.\" Fifty-five percent of surveyors typically book flights via airline Web sites, and another 14 percent book through Expedia, Travelocity, etc. Other Survey findings: Among the \"Big Six\" U.S. carriers – American, Continental, Delta, Northwest, United, US Airways – Continental ranked first overall for domestic as well as international flights. The principal irritants for surveyors are delays, cancellations and waiting (cited by 42% of respondents), followed by cramped seating and crowding (21%) and poor service (13%). Ironically, food was criticized by only 2% of surveyors, perhaps signaling that passengers largely agree with the surveyor who declared \"airline food is an oxymoron.\" New York City's JFK airport scored a dubious double whammy – it was voted the worst domestic airport (followed by Chicago's O'Hare) as well as the worst international airport (with London's Heathrow as No. 2). For full survey results – including top lists plus ratings and reviews for the 77 airlines covered in the Survey – see our U.S. Airlines and International Airlines reports (Adobe® Reader® is required to view the files; if you don't have it, click here to download for free). Meanwhile, read on for a sampling of choice comments – including many that our lawyers wouldn't let us include in our reviews – that reflect the current state of frustration in the air. \"The uncomfortable served the inedible by the indifferent.\" \"If they could sell space in the overheads, travelers would be stacked up like cold cuts.\" \"Need air marshals to protect passengers from crew.\" \"Cabin staff treats you like a stranger crashing a dinner party – only they don't serve food.\" \"Only an hour behind schedule and didn't crash – lived up to my expectations.\" \"If you're a transplanted NYer nostalgic for abuse, this is your airline.\" \"'I'm sorry, sir, but we've discontinued legroom.'\" \"Once stuck I was, back of the plane No pleasure I could at all feign The tiny cramped seat, delays, mystery meat And no upgrade made experience a pain.\" \"Best of the big full-service carriers, or in other words, the cream of the cr*p.\" \"Now I know what the cows felt like on the Chisholm Trail.\" \"Like Con Air – they'd even handcuff you if they could.\" \"Seats like bad lawn chairs.\" \"'Shut up, we get you there' could be their slogan.\" \"Seats should recline only so much – could have performed dental work on the person in front of me.\" \"Fares set by someone with a dartboard.\" \"Economy class is like the Bataan Death March with carry-on luggage.\" \"Like being shipped via UPS to your destination.\" \"Take it out back and shoot it.\" \"I'll start with the good: Web site easy to navigate. That's the end of the good.\" \"What's next, no seats? – wait, better not give them any ideas!\" \"Nothing left to vote on – no food, no snacks, no pillows, no movies, no audio, no nothing.\" \"Gives whole new meaning to the word 'Airbus.'\" \"What next, $3 to use the air vents?\" \"Don't go unless you have a chiropractor and psychotherapist traveling with you.\" \"Challenging log-in, difficult ticketing, rude gate agents, wretched food and contortionist seating – what's not to like?\" \"Feels like an airline going under – oh wait, they are.\" \"Next step is passengers dressing as flight attendants and serving drinks to save yet more money.\" \"Ground service and ticket agents explain what happened to the KGB staff when the Soviet Union collapsed.\" \"They treat lab rats better than they do passengers on this airline.\" \"Would rather take a donkey.\" \"Lost my luggage so often I keep a standard complaint letter on my PC.\" \"This is why the pope kisses the ground every time he deplanes.\" \"'Brown or gray?' could be the choice for dinner.\" \"Customer care rivals Sweeney Todd's.\" \"Could use economy as torture to get prisoners to talk.\" \"Only things older than the planes are the flight attendants – and the meals.\" \"'Good service' translates to 'we won't bother you if you don't bother us.'\" \"Coach class is like the 7 th circle of hell.\" \"If you like bad food flung by crones, fly this airline.\" \"Charging money for booze on international flights – give me a paper cut and rub lemon in it, whydoncha?\"

All about Alinea

***CONTENT
By Daniel Paul Simmons III, ZAGAT.com staff editor Few restaurants in recent memory have drawn as much pre-opening attention as Alinea ('uh-LIN-ee-uh'), Chicago chef Grant Achatz's ambitious New American. For nigh on a year, it had gourmets salivating, Internet chat sites humming and the media buzzing, with some pundits proclaiming it possibly the country's best dining destination – even before it delivered its debut dish in early May. Why all the hoopla? Alinea – whose name refers to an old typographical symbol indicating 'a new idea' – is the latest, most high-profile U.S. example of a global movement known as molecular gastronomy, a burgeoning discipline that applies science to the art of cooking, resulting in always inventive, sometimes bizarre creations (see the dishes pictured at the bottom of this page) that redefine 'cutting-edge cuisine'. Zagat surveyors who've managed to snag a seat at what has rapidly become one of Chicago's toughest culinary tickets have been weighing in, and most report \"a marvelous experience\" \"indulging\" in \"outstanding,\" \"ethereal\" cooking that \"wows the senses\" \"like nothing before\" – as reflected in our preview review below. First, though, the much-talked-about toque shares his own insights on his celebrated new venture. Zagat Survey: What kind of customers have you been getting? Grant Achatz: The first ones in the door were hard-core foodies who made their reservations when we opened the phones in February. Then we had an influx of destination diners from all over – New York, Los Angeles, Tokyo, the U.K. Now we're seeing a lot of locals; they joke that having us as their neighborhood restaurant is going to kill their pocketbooks! ZS: Long before Alinea, you were known for dishes that reflect a certain theatricality. How important is that aspect of your work? GA: It's paramount only behind taste. We try to give people a lot of different emotions throughout the meal – surprise, intrigue, anticipation – so when they walk out, they realize they just had a really complex experience. ZS: And how does the restaurant's environment play into diners' perceptions of the cuisine? GA: We wanted the interior to reflect the philosophy of the food, from the modern architectural details and color palettes to the one-of-a-kind kitchen equipment to the custom-designed serving ware. Every aspect was formed around this central idea. ZS: You come from a family of more traditional restaurateurs; how do your parents react to your work? GA: If they didn't like it, would they tell me? After all, your mom's your mom... But I think they're excited, and proud. Also I believe they really enjoy it – they're open-minded folks. ZS: What would you say to someone who's not so open, who thinks your dishes sound outlandish? GA: You know, I can describe a dish, make analogies to other dishes, reference historic flavor combinations, talk about textures and aromas. But the only way to judge it is to actually eat it. One of my favorite things is when we have a party of four, and three are really excited but the fourth was dragged along. I love to show naysayers that food can be creative but taste good too. We take great pride in putting flavor and taste first. If we come up with an interesting technique but it produces something that doesn't have the desired effect on the palate, we just won't use it. ZS: Who are your inspirations? GA: Paramount is Thomas Keller. I worked for him for four years at The French Laundry, and he's the mentor who really led me down this path. El Bulli [near Rosas, Spain] is obviously a phenomenon, and what [Ferran and Alberto Adrià] have created there is unprecedented. Heston Blumenthal at The Fat Duck [in Bray, England] has been wildly successful. Also Wylie Dufresne at WD-50 [in New York]. And it's popular right now to say that France is dead, but I don't believe that: Pierre Gagnaire [of Paris' Pierre Gagnaire] and Alain Passard [of L'Arpège, also in Paris] might not be quite as far out [as some], but they're still doing creative cooking with integrity and discipline. ZS: With chefs such as yourself, Homaro Cantu at Moto and Graham Elliot Bowles at Avenues, Chicago has become a center for such forward-thinking cuisine. Why? GA: Some days I think it's just coincidence. I spent time at Charlie Trotter's and then took the position at Trio [now Trio Atelier], so it was natural for me to stay here once I'd established myself. When I went to Trio in 2001, [owner] Henry [Adaniya] and I were batting around concepts, and I said right up front, my food's going to be different and risky. But then it was accepted wholeheartedly, so that set some precedents. At the same time, though, you can argue that this isn't an entirely new thing. ZS: How so? GA: Chicago's had a strong culinary backbone for a long time. Rewind the clock 18 years to when Charlie Trotter's opened: I remember reading articles about how he was this wacky avant-gardist, putting Asian influences on the same plate with French ingredients. And then along comes Rick Tramonto [of Tru] doing his own artistic version of French food, weaving in different cultures. So it's a natural progression. ZS: Are we going to see more Achatz outposts, perhaps in Las Vegas or New York? GA: No, I haven't even considered it yet. We need to funnel all our energy into this. The first outside project will hopefully be some kind of cookbook [about] the Alinea philosophy. ZS: There does seem to be interest in the mechanics of molecular gastronomy... GA: Actually, I don't know how relevant the term 'molecular gastronomy' is for us. Heston kind of coined that phrase, and it's fitting for him and for more science-based cuisine like at Moto, but science is not our focus, or even our starting point – it's merely a tool. There's this idea that you have a team of 20 guys with white coats and test tubes in a laboratory, poking and prodding food into something that looks totally manipulated. But I want people to know that it starts with the food. This is just creative, artistic cooking.

Alfresco with a Twist

By Carla Spartos, ZAGAT.com staff editor Even in the most basic of settings – a few umbrella-topped tables wedged onto a sliver of urban sidewalk, for example – outdoor dining (and drinking) has an intrinsic appeal that's hard to argue with. But every year, savvy restaurateurs look to up the alfresco ante by offering extra enticements designed to give them an edge in attracting the garden-patio-rooftop crowd. Following is a rundown on five such twists that are catching on this season, along with a sampling of places where you can experience them. The twist: Beds and cabanas. The appeal: Lie back and gaze up at the stars or just act like one in your own VIP nook. Where to find it: BED New York: Six king-size beds plus two bars will beckon revelers to this Chelsea French-American's rooftop, scheduled to open in early July. Ono, New York: The garden at this Japanese in the Meatpacking District's Hotel Gansevoort sports lounge beds, but high rollers who really want to make a statement can book one of four private cabanas for the evening. Each comes with a flat-screen TV, Dom Perignon and other tipples plus nibbles such as sushi and robata grill items. The asking price? A cool four grand. Nikki Beach, Miami: In the town where reclining dining started, the bronzed and beautiful head to this South Beach hedonist's scene where they can grab a private tented bed and hang out with other members of their tribe. Shout, Atlanta: Hotlantans like to book the sleek private cabanas on this Midtowner's rooftop lounge, where skyline views accompany the Eclectic fare. The twist: Dog-friendly amenities. The appeal: Forget doggy bags – Rover can tag along to these oases. Where to find it: redDog Cafe, Washington, DC: This aptly named Silver Spring New American welcomes the four-legged set at its outdoor tables, where servers stand ready to fetch Fido treats and a water bowl. South Water Kitchen, Chicago: Complimentary biscuits and bottomless bowls of water are among the a-pooch-rements available on the patio of this traditional Loop American. Shake Shack, New York: Canines can cool off with a Pooch-ini – frozen custard, peanut butter and a dog biscuit – at Danny Meyer's summer stand in Madison Square Park (southeast corner, enter at Madison and 23rd Street; 212-889-6600). Tremont 647, Boston: On Saturdays from 2 to 5 PM, Spot can indulge in a Dogmopolitan (lamb broth spiked with fresh beet juice and garnished with a twist) on the patio of this South End New American. The twist: Fire pits. The appeal: They’re the next best thing to a beach bonfire. Where to find it: Beechwood, Los Angeles: Venice's cool crowd heats up by gathering 'round the sleekly designed fire pit in this New American's modernist open-air lounge. Madame Tong's @ JL Beach Club, Hamptons: Jean-Luc Kleefield will complete his trio of haute Hamptons hangouts with this Southampton Pan-Asian (256 Elm Street; 631-204-0300). Slated to open July 4th weekend, its greenery-enclosed patio will feature a fire pit, gazebos and chaise longues. Ocean & Vine, Los Angeles: At this New American in the Loews Santa Monica Beach Hotel, diners can gaze at the fabulous views of the pier or at the flickering fire pits that grace the patio and dining room. The twist: Asian-inspired libations. The appeal: Something different for the mojito-weary. Where to find it: Katana, Los Angeles: If stargazing on the secluded patio of this swank Sunset Japanese doesn't set you swooning, the sake-based cocktails just might. Poste, Washington, DC: This Penn Quarter New American's courtyard is a fine setting for sipping its Thai twist on the mojito, which uses lemongrass in place of mint. SushiSamba rio, Chicago: The expansive rooftop bar of this River North Japanese-Brazilian serves up a ‘moshiso' that's mixed with shochu (a clear Japanese spirit similar to vodka) and muddled with the Japanese herb shiso. Tabla, New York: Tamarind margaritas, ginger citrus snaps (a mix of crème de ginger, orange vodka and sparkling wine) and kumquat mojitos are among the seasonal elixirs served on the covered patio at this Madison Square Park Indian-inflected New American. The twist: Retractable roofs. The appeal: Rain can’t stop the outdoor action at these places. Where to find it: August, New York: The back garden at this rustic Greenwich Village European features a retractable glass roof that lets in cool breezes and a view of surrounding greenery. Geisha House, Los Angeles: Stargazers and late-night smokers mingle under the convertible roof in the open-air Moon Room at this celeb-backed Hollywood Japanese. U Street Lounge, San Francisco: The back lounge at this sophisticated Cow Hollow Club can resemble an open-air party when the glass roof retracts and a DJ spins dance tunes.

Sommeliers Sound Off

***CONTENT
By Robert Seixas, ZAGAT.com staff editor The stereotype of the haughty sommelier steering diners to super-expensive wines is as dusty as a 100-year-old bottle of Château Latour. Like the restaurant industry in general, sommeliers have shifted away from a fussy, formal approach. These days, they function more as consultants, sharing their knowledge with customers who are increasingly likely to know a thing or two about wines themselves. Yet dealing with a sommelier can still inspire a certain degree of anxiety – the fear that your palate or pocketbook simply won't measure up. To get the view from the other side of the corkscrew, we spoke with three master sommeliers (only 74 people hold that title in North America): Roger Dagorn (of New York City's Chanterelle), Paul Roberts (wine director for the Thomas Keller Restaurant Group, including California's French Laundry and per se in New York) and William Sherer (of New York's Atelier). Their insights should prove enlightening whether you're a wine novice or know-it-all. ZS: What's a diner's biggest fear when ordering wine? Dagorn: \"That they'll feel stupid or intimidated.\" Sherer: \"That the sommelier is going to talk them into trying a wine they may not want.\" Roberts: \"They worry 'have I gotten a good deal?'\" ZS: Do customers ever complain about the markup on wines, and how do you handle it? Sherer: \"I would apologize! On occasion, someone will comment. But we usually get people looking for fine, expensive wines, and they have an expectation that certain wines should live in certain price zones.\" Dagorn: \"Not often. People have to realize there are other expenses involved – salaries, money for linens. And there's a restaurant's profit margin of 30 percent.\" Roberts: \"A few complain and compare the prices to retail, but they should know they're paying for the whole experience. We would never get into having that kind of conversation with the customer at the table. We would somehow come across as rude.\" ZS: Can you tell how much a customer knows about wine? Sherer: \"[Yes], by the way they talk about wine.\" Dagorn: \"No, it's not so easy. And people normally don't tout their level of knowledge.\" ZS: What does it take to become a wine expert – can anyone learn, or does it require a superior palate? Dagorn: \"Anyone can train themselves. The education aspect is important before you train your palate – knowing where wines come from, the climatic condition of certain regions, etc. [Training] the palate comes next, and anyone can do that.\" Sherer: \"Curiosity. And the love of wine is necessary. Things you like come easily.\" ZS: Have you ever been stumped by a customer's question? Roberts: \"Everybody forgets. I tell a customer that I'll look up the answer.\" ZS: What happens if a customer says a $1,000 wine is flawed, but you disagree? Sherer: \"Very rarely happens. In the business, we say 'did you punch their card,' meaning, did you feel them out first. Maybe someone who's familiar with ripe, powerful Napa Valley–style Cabernets will be taken aback by a dry, earthy old Bordeaux. [But even] if I think the wine is sound, and the customer insists it isn't, I offer another similar wine – at no extra charge, of course.\" ZS: What if a customer says he hates a bottle of wine – after drinking half of it? Dagorn: \"I'll offer something else. A good experience for a customer is most important. We want them to come back and feel good about the service.\" ZS: What was your most embarrassing sommelier moment? Sherer: \"Once a captain poured port into a table's glasses already filled with a 1982 Bordeaux that today would be worth $1,500.\" Dagorn: \"I'll be having a conversation with someone at the table when I realize I'm pouring a red wine into someone's white wine glass. Which makes rosé.\" Roberts: \"I remember the first bottle I ever opened as a sommelier – I cut my finger and was bleeding all over the place. And my boss was watching me the whole time.\" ZS: What customer behaviors annoy you? Sherer: \"When they immediately assume they can't trust me, that I'm here only to push wine sales.\" Dagorn: \"That they want to pour the wine themselves. I really don't understand why people [do that]. It's second nature to us, and that's what we do here – to know how to fill a glass appropriately, among other things.\" Roberts: \"Sometimes a guest dismisses you, and it kind of hurts – since you reach a [master level], you hope they respect you.\" ZS: What wines currently offer some of the best value? Dagorn: \"Pinot Noir from New Zealand. And wines from the Southern Rhône and Languedoc-Roussillon.\" Roberts: \"Spain is on fire now [among inexpensive wines]. When you equate value with sheer top quality, I would say some Californian Syrahs.\" Sherer: \"Argentinean Malbecs. Moderately priced Austrian Rieslings and Grüner Veltliners.\" ZS: What do you drink at home? Dagorn: \"Wine and lots of water.\" Roberts: \"A lot of beer. And Dolcettos, Barberas.\" Sherer: \"Everything. Beer, Burgundys and kirs.\"

By Betsy Andrews, ZAGAT.com staff editor It used to be that fame, beauty, style or the right connections were what it took to get past the velvet rope at hot nightspots. But these days just about anybody can buy themselves into the scene via bottle service. The trend started in Europe, spread to New York and is now common throughout the States. From Philly's Denim to Vegas' Risqué to LA's Spider Club, you'll find patrons partying like rock stars at tables with bottles of liquor and mixers, making their own drinks or having their servers pour. The appeal for club owners is as clear as a dry martini: bottles typically sell for $250 and up – a 1,000% markup – and minimum purchases apply. But the impresarios believe there's also lots in it for customers. Says Noah Tepperberg, co-owner of NYC's Marquee, \"You can leave your jacket or purse and sit when you want. The table is your own piece of real estate.\" Amy Sacco of Manhattan's chic Bungalow 8 and Lot 61 suggests, \"It's great to do with a client or date you want to impress. The staff will pay more attention to you and remember you when you come back.\" But not everyone is high on the concept. Hipsters dis it as the death of the cool. And Zagat surveyors who've tried it have mixed opinions. For some it's the \"best bet\" for \"feeling comfortable\" and being treated \"like an A-lister,\" while for others it's \"obnoxious\" and \"not worth it.\" All agree it will cost you, though, so before plunking down your platinum card, consider these tips: Be Choosy: Any joint can cordon off a couple of tables and call it a VIP area. But a club that centers around bottle service is more likely to be \"designed for comfort\" and staffed by well-trained servers, according to Jamie Mulholland of NYC's super-swank Cain. Book Ahead: A reservation generally guarantees seats. Otherwise, you might find yourself on the sidewalk in a bouncer-orchestrated bottle-bidding war. Do Research: Ask beforehand about minimums (usually one bottle per four people), gratuities (often 20% tacked onto the bill), cancellation fees, table time limits and menus. Mix It Up: Clubs are always concerned that there aren't enough women in the house, so a group with a good girl-to-guy ratio is likely to have an easier time at the door. They're also less likely to be pressured to spend as much as an all-guy group. Living Large: If you're really looking for luxe, bottle service is only the beginning. Some high-end spots offer perks like concierge service, or a limo with a designated driver – for an extra (stiff) charge, of course.

By Carol Diuguid, ZAGAT.com staff editor Seems there are two things that no superstar chef can be without these days: a sharp knife and a Vegas restaurant. Among those rolling the dice in Sin City: Daniel Boulud (DB Brasserie, opening in April), Tom Colicchio (Craftsteak), Thomas Keller (Bouchon), Nobu Matsuhisa (Nobu), Bradley Ogden (Bradley Ogden), Wolfgang Puck (Spago) and Jean-Georges Vongerichten (Prime). What's drawing them? Demand and dollars. \"Las Vegas is not just a place to gamble anymore – people go there with high expectations about the food,\" says Nobu Matsuhisa. He's clearly meeting those expectations – his Vegas Nobu, in the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino, was rated No. 1 for Food in our last Las Vegas Survey. Bradley Ogden, whose eponymous restaurant is set in Caesars Palace on the glitzy Strip – a sharp contrast to the bucolic surrounds of the Lark Creek Inn, his acclaimed northern California flagship – agrees: \"Look at the increase in luxury hotel rooms in Las Vegas – all these guests are perfect for our style of restaurant.\" And resorts are going out of their way to make Vegas ventures a recipe for business success. \"They're usually very good deals – there's no money you have to put in,\" notes Tom Colicchio of NYC's highly rated Gramercy Tavern and Craft, who has two outposts in the MGM Grand – Craftsteak and 'wichcraft. Indeed, owning a Vegas restaurant can be like hitting the jackpot at the slots. \"The amount of money that the restaurants in Las Vegas are grossing, including Prime, is staggering,\" says Jean-Georges Vongerichten, the culinary powerhouse behind Bellagio's Prime steakhouse as well as several top spots in Manhattan and elsewhere. Most chefs would argue that their Vegas ventures match the quality of their flagships. But the clientele can be a bit more laid-back. \"We have people walk into the restaurant with beer bottles in their hands! That doesn't happen elsewhere,\" says Matsuhisa. How do these chefs' Vegas restaurants rate with Zagat surveyors? Here's the verdict: Bradley Ogden Strip Caesars Palace 3570 Las Vegas Blvd. S. (Flamingo Rd.) Las Vegas, Nevada 89109 702-731-7110 www.caesars.com Food Decor Service Cost 27 25 26 $72 Connoisseurs come to Caesars Palace not to bury chef Bradley Ogden but to praise him for his \"extravagant, outstanding\" New American menu featuring \"superb\" organic dishes made from \"farm-fresh\" ingredients (such as a \"Maytag blue cheese soufflé that'll make you think you died and went to foodie heaven\"), accompanied with \"serious china and linens\" and presented by an \"engaging\" staff; such a \"sublime experience\" \"doesn't come cheap\", though, so you'd \"better win big or you'll leave hungry.\" These ratings & review are based on the reviews of initial visitors Key to Zagat Ratings Craftsteak Strip MGM Grand Hotel 3799 Las Vegas Blvd. S. (Tropicana Ave.) Las Vegas, Nevada 89109 702-891-7318 www.mgmgrand.com Food Decor Service Cost 24 23 23 $68 \"Craft your own meal\" at this \"gorgeous\" \"high roller\", a surf 'n' turfer in the MGM from Manhattan chef Tom Colicchio, whose menu is a virtual \"primer on artisanal and organic foods\" (\"incredible vegetables\", \"moo-velous\" beef from \"grass-fed\" cattle) that allows guests to \"graze on\" \"pure\", \"unique flavors\"; the \"family-style\" feasting means the \"fun\" just \"gets better the larger your group\" is, but be sure to leave folks who \"don't like to serve themselves\" back in the hotel room.

Flamingo Rd. & Harmon Ave.) Las Vegas, Nevada 89109 702-693-5090 www.nobumatsuhisa.com Food Decor Service Cost 28 23 24 $69 \"Master/showman\" Nobu Matsuhisa's \"magnificent\", \"mind-blowingly\" \"artful\" creations are \"so beautiful you hate to eat them\", but they're also \"simply\" \"sublime\" (\"whether cooked or raw\"), \"amazing taste buds\" and earning this \"trendy\" east-of-Strip Peruvian-influenced Japanese the No. 1 rating for Food in our Survey; \"crowded\" with the \"young and hip\" having \"noisy\" \"fun\", it's \"not a great place for the rookie\", and you'll definitely need to \"bring your yen\" (or \"your banker\"), but rest assured that it does \"live up to the hype.\" These ratings & review are based on the reviews of initial visitors Key to Zagat Ratings Prime Strip Bellagio Hotel 3600 Las Vegas Blvd. S.

Here are some of our all-time favorite voter comments, including some that were too outrageous to use in reviews. Suffers from delusions of adequacy. Took a doggy bag home; the dog refused it. If this place doesn't get you laid, nothing will. Saves fuel bills – the heartburn will keep you warm all winter. The immature eating the indelible. Like a skunk, it's small, it's cute and it stinks. Abandon taste buds all ye who enter here. A petri dish gone horribly, horribly wrong. The roaches always get the best seats. Chef's responsibility is to turn on the microwave. They put the salmon in salmonella. If I want a fatty sandwich served by a walking attitude, I'll go to mom's. Grandma cooked like this, grandpa died young. Good seafood, but the waiter should be used as fish bait. Not what it used to be and it did not used to be much. Duck must have had a long flight – tired, tough and took 90 minutes to arrive. Portions so small I started laughing – prices so high I started crying. Have yet to learn that heat is an integral part of the cooking process. For the price, the lobster should have come via overnight express, not pony express. 'Breaking bread' should not mean you have to use the side of the table. The quiche of death. Should shut down the restaurant and just serve the view.
