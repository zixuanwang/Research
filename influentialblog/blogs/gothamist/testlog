William Grimes came up with a better title for his Howard Johnson's restaurant review: HoJo's to Go? Say It Ain't So Apparently the old HoJo's in Times Square is thinking about packing it in, probably to make room for another Olive Garden restaurant or something like that. I love HoJo's- it was the hotel of choice for my poor pinko parents back in the 1970s. And I disagree with Grimes about the clam strips- I think they are just rubbery enough.
