Even the Obamas Deserve a Break

Has there ever been more scrutiny of the eating habits of White House inhabitants than those of the Obamas? First, there was a call for a self-appointed \"kitchen cabinet.\" Then, the debate over naming a new White House chef, and, of course, the great kitchen garden kerfuffle.Now, Michelle Obama's remarks about cooking are being taken to task on the opinion pages of the New York Times. In an op-ed published on Sunday, Amanda Hesser writes of her disappointment with comments Obama made about, let's say, a lack of enthusiasm for cooking:[W]hen The Washington Post asked Mrs. Obama for her favorite recipe, she replied, “You know, cooking isn’t one of my huge things.” And last month, when a boy who was visiting the White House asked her if she liked to cook, she replied: “I don’t miss cooking. I’m just fine with other people cooking.” Though delivered lightheartedly, and by someone with a very busy schedule, the message was unmistakable: everyday cooking is a chore.Hesser says the statements are not just a letdown because she has been vocal about the importance of healthy, locally-grown ingredients, but because it represents a missed opportunity to bolster dwindling interest in cooking. Hesser's desire for a rebirth in the family kitchen for a nation increasingly detached from the experience of cooking real food from raw ingredients is admirable. And, perhaps things have become so bad that there is a place for government to encourage a return to cooking.However -- and this is a food blogger writing this -- I don't really find what Michelle Obama said so outrageous. First of all, as Eddie Gehman Kohan points out at obamafoodorama, her remarks may have been taken out of context. But, secondly, cooking can be a chore. I think that anyone employed full-time and with children will be aware that the demands of cooking from scratch -- the shopping, the cooking, and the cleaning -- cannot always be met on a limited schedule. And, I imagine Michelle Obama's plate is quite full, to boot. Moreover, it's not as if the Obamas are compromising the progressive views about food embodied in the White House Kitchen Garden. The garden is overseen by the White House kitchen, and the ingredients will used to prepare the family's dinners. It's not as if the organic vegetables are being tossed so in favor of heating up frozen dinners.I also wonder why so much responsibility is being laid at the feet of Michelle Obama? As a dude who cooks, I find it a little sexist to place the responsibility of promoting cooking solely at the feet of the first lady? Would anyone even think twice if the President had uttered his wife's words? Last week's image of Barack strolling across the White House lawn with paper bags full of take-out burgers was pretty much celebrated by the press and public. I hesitate to think of criticism Michelle would have come under were it she was carrying home takeout.Finally, to show how the scrutiny has really gotten out of hand, peruse Frank Bruni's critique of the \"predictability\" of the Obamas' choice of the restaurant Blue Hill for a night out in New York City this past weekend.I understand all of this is happening because expectations are so high for the first family, and that's a good thing. But, this is starting to go too far.Cooking is important. Americans' diets are in trouble. But, let's give the Obamas a break.

There’s a wonderful new book out called “The Power of Small” which was written by Kaplan Thaler and Robin Koval and it’s all about how small things can have a big impact. Obviously this is an extreme case, but this totally exemplifies this – no detail is too small as proven by the attention given to where and what Obama eats! On a personal note however, this book has been great because it made me more conscious about how small things can affect both my personal and professional life. Instead of feeling hopeless it’s best to be proactive and aware, both which this book allows you to do.

Josh, I enjoyed this post and agree with your point of view on the subject. While I don't agree that cooking is a chore, I do find Michelle Obama's honesty refreshing. It's that type of honesty that will endear her to people, and hopefully, make them more willing to listen to the important things she has to say on the topics that are her \"big things.\"

Kudos to Michelle - and Barack - for being real. How they manage to keep their balance in the tsunami of interest and publicity, I can't imagine.

But it makes me appreciate them even more. Aren't we lucky to have such great leaders!

The idea of culinary travel usually conjures up a romanticized image like a trip to Alba to hunt for white truffles, a wine tour of the Rhone Valley, or perhaps the ultimate in foodish travels, a week in Tuscany cooking, eating, and discussing food and wine with Michael Pollan.But, a new promotion that recently arrived in my inbox suggests the innovation of an entirely new genre of gastronomic vacations: ice cream tourism. Apple Core Hotels is offering a \"Gelato Tour\" travel package from July 1 to August 31 which includes accommodations at one of the company's five New York City hotels (starting at $179 per night) and a $30 credit towards scoops from three gelato shops in the West Village-centric \"Gelato District\": Apple Core Hotels guests can take a relaxing stroll through the charming streets of New York City’s “Gelato District”, where their taste buds will be given a workout with the varied flavor offerings––from the traditional Stracciatella to the adventurous Ciocco Peperoncino (chocolate cayenne pepper). Guests will visit the following shops on the tour: Grom (an Italian gelati chain, serving a range of flavors made with first-rate ingredients from the old country), L'Arte Del Gelato (featuring Italian favorites such as Stracciatella, Cassata Siciliana and Biscotti), and Cones (be sure to try the Corn flavor with an optional sprinkle of cinnamon). All three shops are situated within walking distance of one another in the West Village neighborhood of Manhattan.I didn't even know that that New York had a \"Gelato District.\" But, if there is to be one, shouldn't Il Laboratorio del Gelato be chief among the landmarks?

***CONTENT
Mark your calendars. The next \"World Testicle & Aphrodisiac Cooking Championship\" (ballcup.com) will be held on August 29-30, 2009, in Gornji Milanovac, Serbia.Officially titled \"Mud®ijada,\" the goal of the competition is \"promoting testicle specialities [sic] as well as Serbian traditional cuisine.\"The website offers this mission statement of sorts: \"The Scots have Scotch, the Swiss have cheese, and we Serbs have balls! Why shouldn’t we sell them to the world as a real Serbian trademark speciality from Shumadija?\"The event is the brainchild of Serbian chef Ljubomir R. Erovic, who, you may remember, is the author of The Testical Cookbook: Cooking With Balls. Something of a testicle evangelist, Erovic had a testicular epiphany when, \"sometime at the end of the ‘80s,\" he unwittingly devoured a delicious testicle goulash:\"I couldn’t sleep that very night because I became incredibly aroused and felt a real 'charge of positive energy' that I had to use somehow. I had never experienced anything like that before. The next day, after the wild night, I found out from a friend that the dish we ate was testicle goulash. I suddenly realized that it could be a great way to help the sexually troubled ones and through the cooking contests discover the strongest aphrodisiac to conquer the world. The way to better sexual life through food and not drugs is the idea that keeps running through my mind.\"Just as there is an Olympic Village at the Olympics, there will be a \"Balls Village\" at the Testicle Championship with \"music, drinks, and promotional activities for homemade aphrodisiacs and accessories for a healthy sex life (nuts, honey, whole nuts, peanuts and special herbs.\" Did I mention nuts?The website lists a series of strict \"rules\" for the championship: attendance by minors or people older then 65 (\"without medical approval\") is not allowed, bringing Viagra is forbidden, and, \"the 'casual' visit to the 'balling village' is prohibited.\"And, if the ladies out there were thinking about attending, the regulations note that \"Women are allowed everything.\"

Court Rules Against Pringles
***AUTHOR

***DATE
2009-05-26 00:00:00
***CONTENT
A UK Court of Appeal decided once and for all last week that Pringles are \"crisps\" (what the British call chips) and are subject to the 15% Value Added Tax (VAT). To be taxed, a snack product \"must be wholly, or substantially wholly, made from the potato.\"The ruling was a defeat for Proctor & Gamble, which owns the Pringles brand. Oddly enough, Proctor & Gamble's lawyers insisted that Pringles were not crisps, arguing that they are distinguished by their uniform color and shape \"not found in nature.\"That view was upheld in a trial last year in which a judge ruled that Pringles were not \"made from the potato\" (potatoes only make up 42% of Pringles' ingredients).But, the Court of Appeal judges overruled that decision, finding that Pringles had “more than enough potato content” to be considered crisps, and therefore would be taxable going forward.

Lifting the Veil on Industrial Food
***AUTHOR

***CONTENT
We're living in a \"lifting the veil\" moment.From getting a grip on how we arrived at this global financial crisis to revelations about the Bush administration's legal wrangling to allow waterboarding at Guantanamo Bay, not to mention calls for further investigations (and prosecutions), the veil is being lifted everywhere.There's a lot of talk about \"lifting the veil\" in the new documentary film Food Inc. Here, the filmmakers want to reveal to the audience how industrial food makes it from the farm to your table and show audiences the stark difference between the idealized images of farming on food packing and the serious problems of modern industrial food production, ranging from ethical issues in the treatment of animals to fair labor practices, food safety crises, and the increasing health problems due to change in diets towards carbohydrates influenced by the business of food. It's all a little depressing to watch. But, while the muckraking film clearly has an agenda for change, it's not overbearing. The tone is cool, not hot. With excellent cinematography and colorful graphics, the presentation is more Al Gore than Michael Moore. Sort of a gastronomic An Inconvient Truth if you will.If you are familiar with the work of authors Michael Pollan and Eric Schlosser (who both appear as talking heads in the movie), you may not learn much of anything particularly new. The film rehashes the (compelling) arguments these authors have made concerning how government policy has favored \"cheap food,\" driving the food industry toward producing the lowest common denominator in terms of nutrition, negative environmental impact, and health risk.But, to use a cliche, a picture does speak a thousand words, and so while it may be one thing to read about factory farming, it's another thing to see footage of Matrix-like chicken processing plants where thousands of fuzzy cute baby chickens are hatched and pulled from steel drawers and and sorted and stamped like mail through a system of conveyor belts and chutes. It's as marvelous as it is disturbing. And when the filmmakers are not allowed to see inside the houses where chickens are grown -- the curtains are pulled down to keep the daylight out -- what we don't see is even more haunting.Unfortunately, the film is terribly one-sided, but only because it seems that all of the corporations featured in the film -- Monsanto, Tyson, Smithfield, Perdue -- declined to be interviewed. They did this at their peril, at least cinematically, as they remain faceless while the filmmakers interview a range of sympathetic farmers who are severely restricted by the heavy influence of big agriculture. A particularly insightful segment deals with a farmer whose dwindling \"seed saving\" business is under attack from lawyers from Monsanto seeking to protect their patented seed strains. But, it's not all bad news. The film does get a bit of uplift and some humor from the farmer Joel Salatin, a charismatic iconoclast and true believer in traditional methods of raising livestock and working outside of the industrial system. His corporate counterpart is the yogurt giant Stoneyfield Farm, which has managed to carve out some success using organic practices. It's depicted as a model for making changes in the business of food. In a late rally, Pollan suggests, on a positive note, that however daunting it may seem, change is possible, comparing the challenge of transforming the food industry to the success of anti-smoking advocates in changing the tobacco industry.The film is very effective at weaving together a complicated message about ethics, health, and the environment, but I don't know whether audiences will be emboldened or just dejected and head back to the snack bar for the haze of a new veil made of salty popcorn with fake butter and high fructose corn syrup-spiked soda.

Zip Code win·ery (noun): A winery whose vineyards may be located in one place, but seeks to associate itself with another area.In her profile of wine business mogul Fred Franzia in the May 18, 2009 issue of the New Yorker, Dana Goodyear describes how Franzia's popular Charles Shaw wine (also known as \"Two Buck Chuck\") gains from the prestige associated with the Napa Valley wine region -- where it is bottled -- even though it is made from grapes grown in vineyards in California's less desirable Central Valley:Although Charles Shaw wine falls under the generic California appellation, the broadest possible desig­nation, it can legitimately be labelled “Cellared & Bottled by Charles Shaw Winery, Napa, CA,” a practice that strikes many in Napa as unsavory. “It’s called a Zip Code winery,” Vic Motto, a business adviser to Napa Valley wineries, says. “The unsuspecting consumer may not realize it’s not Napa wine. Fred uses that to his advantage.”

hmm... if you had a regular set of measuring spoons... there is normally a 1/2 tbsp... adn that's 1 1/2 tsp, isn't it? 1/8 tsp is a feature in most measuring spoon sets i have, but he 2 tsp could come in handy. i rarely see 2/3 tsp in recipes though and a pinch is just a pinch. i love the handles though... but $15 is a tad expensive, especially with shipping.

Based on the relative success of last year's square foot gardening experiment, I've been at work on this year's sequel.The 2009 edition will be a beefed up version of last year. I added two more narrow boxes (our space is limited) primarily for salad greens, on either side of the two original boxes. I've also been planting thyme between the boxes as an edible groundcover.So, what's new for this year? More greens, as I noted above. I'm planning to devote four of the squares to salad greens: mesclun, a mix of Asian greens, arugula, and frisee. I've started these plants as seeds in trays and will be planting them shortly. In the interim, I thought I would try growing a bunch of spinach plants in their dedicated squares (it's supposed to mature quickly), and then plant out the salad seedlings once the spinach is harvested.I'm also growing broccoli rabe, fennel, peas, and garlic chives (all of which I did not try last year) along with heirloom tomatoes, cucumbers, radishes, carrots, and beets. The biggest question mark of all will be cantaloupe, which I am really doing mostly for fun -- after all, I'm only growing one plant. The vine will grow vertically on a trellis and apparently will require some kind of makeshift support crafted from pantyhose so the melons won't tear off and fall down off the vine. Should be interesting. Here's the contents of the garden at week 4, box by box (left to right):Box #1 (back to front): Peas, Spinach (mesclun later), Spinach (Asian greens to come later).Box #2 (back to front, row by row): cucumber, cucumber, cantaloupe; broccoli rabe; broccoli rabe; garlic chives; radishes, radishes, beets.Box #3 (back to front, row by row): Heirloom tomatoes -- \"Old German,\" \"Mr. Stripey,\" and \"Cherokee Purple\"; bush beans, swiss chard, fennel; basil, carrots, spinach.Box #4 (back to front): Pole beans, arugula, frisee.If you want to follow along, I'll be posting photos to flickr (here are photos from last year). And the flickr square foot gardening group is an excellent resource and source of inspiration.Finally, a question for all of the experienced vegetable gardners out their: to grow \"cut and come\" lettuce like mesclun picked as baby leaves, do you simply scatter the seeds (with abandon, ignoring spacing rules)? How many seeds are too many?

Josh- Very inspiring and cool.  I've done herbs and tomatoes on my small balcony in Brooklyn, this has me thinking I can do more next year, just go vertical!

I'm not a pro but my Mom is and from what I recall growing up we scattered the lettuce seeds evenly and not \"with abandon\". Can't give you a guide but my memory tells me it's exactly the same as seasoning a good roast liberally.  It's about the same coverage and dispersal.  No piles, no blank spots, a nice even layer.  I think the width was about 1 1/2\".  Will double check on the phone with her next chance I get. Good luck!

ghost a·cres (noun): The amount of land needed by a nation to produce the equivalent amount of food it procures by trade and sea.Closely related to the concept of \"food miles,\" ghost acres was coined by scientist, geographer, and ecologist Georg Borgstrom in his 1965 book The Hungry Planet.Anthropologist John H. Bodley explained the meaning of the term in his 2007 book Anthropology and Contemporary Human Problems:In 1965, food scientist Georg Borgstrom introduced the concept of ghost acres, referring to the fact that trade and fishing were ways of gaining extraterritorial acres. Ghost acres were calculated as the amount of land a given country would need to put in production to gain an equivalent amount of animal protein equivalent to its net food imports and fishery production. Ghost acres have also been called \"phantom carrying capacity.\" According to this reckoning many nations had already far exceeded the carrying capacity of their farmlands -- at least given their culturally prescribed food patterns -- and had become precariously dependent on uncertain international markets and frail marine resources. At that time Borgstrom calculated that Japan's ghost acres exceeded its agricultural acreage by more than six times and the United Kingdom's effective acres were nearly tripled by ghost acres.\"\"The problem with subsisting on ghost acres,\" Bodley explained, \"is that global fisheries are now heavily over-exploited and in danger of collapse. By 2003, seven of the top-ten species, constituting 30 percent of global wild fisheries, were considerd to be fully exploited and in danger of collapse.\"Hat tip to The Ethicurean for bringing this interesting concept to our attention.

\"Lost\" Eats: Jacob's Stone-Roasted Filet of Fish

Admittedly, this post is straining at relevance, but since I can't get \"Lost\" off my mind, let's talk about the island's latest contribution to things culinary: Jacob's stone-roasted filet of fish.If you don't know what I'm talking about, there's just too much too explain. But, if you did see last night's \"Lost\" finale, you will remember the initial scenes of the episode where Jacob, circa 1800s, trapped a fish, deftly fileted it, and slapped it on a hot rock to cook.So, what exactly was Jacob cooking and what's the significance? I thought it was a red snapper. But, according to all-things-\"Lost\" authority lostpedia, it was (literally) a red herring. A number of bloggers have had said the same, also noting the not-so-subtle double-meaning. Others have noted biblical references to fish, and . . . here's a stretch of a connection . . . \"Also Ben is a Pisces.\"Whatever the case may be, it's definitely a step up from the DHARMA fish biscuits.Images: http://losteastereggs.blogspot.com/.

From the inbox, the PR people for \"The Martha Stewart Show\" send these sound bites from Mayor Michael Bloomberg's appearance today on the daytime television show.In addition to showing off his cookie-baking skills, the Mayor expounded upon his gastromantic techniques:MS: When people ask you about New York City, what are the three things…that are absolutely important for out-of-towners to do, to see, to visit?MB: Well, number one, I would take the Staten Island Ferry over to Staten Island – get off. There are lots of cultural things on Staten Island, but even if you don’t have time to do that, take it over and back. It’s free and you get a phenomenal view of the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island and the skyline of Brooklyn and Manhattan.MS: You don’t know this, but do you know what happened to me on the Staten Island Ferry?MB: What?MS: I got engaged.MB: Mazal tov! I wont asked what happened after that.MS: Well that’s history, but it was very exciting and the view is very nice.MB: I used to buy a six pack of beer and a pizza and take a date…it was very romantic and something I could do. The second thing I would do is go to a Greek diner. Greek diners are something that is unique to New York. There’s a thousands things on the menu; they all cost about five bucks; they come in 30 seconds; and they all taste good. If I was going to eat every meal for the rest of my life in one restaurant, it would be a Greek diner…and then I guess the last thing I would do…Broadway show.

Writers including Zora Neale Hurston, Eudora Welty, and Nelson Algren contributed to the 1930s project which was eventually abandoned as World War II approached and never completed.

Reuters is reporting that ABC is working with celebrity chef Jamie Oliver (and Ryan Seacrest's production company) on a new television series that will give \"healthy makeovers\" to an entire American city. The series will be loosely based on \"Jamie's School Dinners,\" Oliver's school lunch project in the U.K. In the new ABC program, Oliver will travel to unhealthy places in the U.S. and find ways to use local resources to improve eating habits. The target city has not been disclosed, but Reuters reports that \"it's expected to be a place that has been cited on 'fattest cities' lists.\" ABC has ordered six hours of the project from Ryan Seacrest Productions and expects to air the show in 2010.

food·scape (noun): 1. The aspect of gastronomy characteristic of a particular place. 2. The art of depicting natural scenery using food as a medium.In a May 20 post on its food blog, Grub Street, New York magazine reported on the type of concessions envisioned at the upcoming Atlantic Yards project in Brooklyn:When the basketball arena opens on the Atlantic Yards site in 2010(ish), Nets fans can expect a mythic Brooklyn foodscape. \"There will be counters and stands with knishes, pizza, hot dogs, egg creams, cheesecake — the goal is really to provide a distinct Brooklyn flavor,\"Foodscape is frequently used in academic discourse on food, culture, and society. In the anthology Food and Culture: A Reader, Gisele Yasmeen writes in a chapter entitled \"'Plastic-bag Housewives' and Postmodern Restaurants?: Public and Private in Bangkok's Foodscape,\":I have proposed the term \"foodscape\" to emphasize the spatialization of foodways and the interconnections between people, food, and places. \"Foodscape,\" drawn from \"landscape,\" is a term used to describe a process of viewing place in which food is used as a lens to bring into focus selected human relations. New York Times reporter Kim Severson recently noted the emerging use of a variation on foodscape -- placeless foodscape -- in the food lexicon: \"Latest addition to food activist-speak: 'placeless foodscape.' That means most of America's groceries and restaurants, apparently.\"The phrase has been used by academics to describe places where food systems are not grounded in the local culture. Roberta Sonnin writes in the Anthropology of Food The concept of embeddedness, borrowed from economic sociology, is widely used to characterize these two different types of food systems: at one end, there is the dis-embedded globalized food system, the ‘placeless foodscape’ (Ilbery and Kneafsey, 2000: 319) of countries such as the UK and the US; at the other end, there are the more embedded, localized food systems of countries such as France and Italy, where food products appear to be forever rooted in a particular place.Foodscapes are also found in the world of art.Pictured above is a foodscape by the the photographer Carl Warner, who assembles extremely detailed landscapes created out of food. The Telegraph collected 14 of Warner's images in this gallery of foodscapes. Warner was preceded by Icelandic artist Erro (Gudmundur Gudmundsson), who in 1974 created Foodscape (below), an oil painting filled chockablock with foodstuffs.

With a coupon giveaway for a free KFC grilled chicken meal on her website, Oprah Winfrey has unwittingly unleashed a firestorm. On the one hand, the giveaway was so popular that it appears to have created a run on grilled chicken at some of the fast food chain's outlets, angering free food seekers. KFC has denied reports that any riots occurred, but has acknowledged that it had to turn away disgruntled coupon-holders: \"Some customers were upset because they couldn't get their chicken, but there was no riot,\" said Laurie Schalow, a KFC spokesperson.Interestingly, Oprah's move is also earning the ire of those who wouldn't likely dine at KFC under any condition, coupon or not. This group of critics, opponents of factory farming, say that Oprah was wrong to endorse a fast food chain that buys its meat from Tyson, the giant chicken processor. \"Oprah needs to get serious ball-busting for giving away KFC!\" tweeted Paula Crossfield, managing editor of the website Civil Eats.She further called Winfrey \"hypocritical\" for embracing KFC:Perhaps it was all just too much, too kind and too ahead of the curve, all that work she had done recently to expose what truly goes on for chickens and other animals in the factory farm setting. Because now Oprah has decided to bolster one of America’s worst offenders when it comes to support for factory farming, KFC, by giving away two pieces of chicken to every human in America.\"It may seem harmless: a mass market “they want it, so I’m giving it to them” kind of campaign. But because Oprah has marketed herself as one who cares about animals, even getting a “Person of the Year” award last year from PETA, this KFC campaign is a serious disappointment to say the least.\"It ws a call to arms, as like-minded critics quickly started voicing their opposition to Winfrey using the Twitter hashtag #oprahkfc.Stepping back from the fracas, New York Times food reporter Kim Severson tweeted this observation about the KFC kerfuffle: \"How many people crawling up Oprah's pantsuit about the KFC grilled chicken have tasted it? It's contempt without investigation, friends.\"

And, there you have it.  

To Paula Crossfield, and her followers out there: Let's stop crucifying Oprah, shall we?  It's a tough economy, and she's giving away free food.  What have you done to feed the hungry humans, lately?  Hmmm...?

Ummm. Oprah has to widespread of an influence (and she knows it) to be this careless about what she endorses. I'm not crucifying anyone, but she really should have thought this one through. And, if she was interested in getting people fed, how 'bout endorsing farmer's markets (for which people can get food stamp vouchers) and growing your own, or asking people to donate to pantries or encouraging people to take up community gardening. 

And by the way, I do help feed people by volunteering my time at our local community garden, which produces tons (that's right, TONS) of fresh, organic produce that goes directly to those that need it, no coupon or factory farms required.

Honestly, no one tripped when Denny's had folks lined up for miles around it's reastaurants on a recent Tuesday, right. And what's the fuss about eating chickens, or was that beef about where and under what conditions the chickens live; see how insane that sounds? So maybe only people who live under the same horrible conditions as chickens should eat them, grilled or fried.

To Jackie: Ok. How can your food reach me and my family? Your food does not get here, Oprah's coupons did. My son and I went to bed without eating that day because my feet, back and legs were hurting so much I couldn't walk to the nearest KFC. I no longer have a car, and wouldn't be able to pay for gas, anyway. Now I can get a raincheck, but I missed out a great meal. If you have EVER been hungry, you know: that would be a GREAT MEAL for anybody who is H.U.N.G.R.Y. BTW, I would  LOOVE ME some fresh, organic produce! Unfortunately, I can't afford it. How is some of all those TONS going to reach my family?
(And to the vegetarians, just say no thank you to the chicken and get the cole slaw, potatoes and biscuit. If you don't want them, give them to someone in need, don't be spoiled, selfish and unaware of the financial and social situation that surrounds you).

I think it was totally wrong of Oprah to misuse her influence to promote this garbage disguised as chicken. Aside from the factory farming issue, it's very unhealthy. It contains MSG and trans-fat among other unhealthy ingredients. Here's a detailed discussion of why KFC's grilled chicken is unhealthy.

Beard Awards Recap: Star Chefs, Spoilers, and a Slammin' Terrine

Recapping last night's live report from the 2009 James Beard Foundation Awards, Jean Georges won the prize for Outstanding Restaurant, Dan Barber won for Outstanding Chef, Nate Appleman (of San Francisco's A16) won the Rising Star Chef award, and Momofuku Ko won for Best New Restaurant. (Chef/Owners: David Chang and Peter Serpico, New York, NY)Jennifer McLagen's Fat: An Appreciation of a Misunderstood Ingredient, with Recipes, won awards for both Single Subject Cookbook and Cookbook of the Year. The James Beard Foundation has a complete listing of all of the winners.Some highlights from the evening:SPOILER ALERT This had to be the oddest thing. In a strange twist, at 9:00 p.m., the New York Times revealed the winners of some of the most important awards of the evening -- outstanding chef, best new restaurant, and others -- notwithstanding the fact that the awards had yet to be given at the ceremony.How could this happen exactly? According to Washington Post food editor Joe Yonan, it appears that the Beard Foundation sent the Times and other major news outlets the names of the winners in advance, but embargoed that information until 9:00 p.m. (when the awards should have probably been over). Since the ceremony went long, when the Times went ahead and published the winners, they preceded the announcement of the awards at the ceremony.This was certainly a buzzkill if you were watching the ceremony live. But, why does this matter? On the one hand, it's a perfectly understandable mix-up. On the other hand, it was one of those \"see how your sausage is made\" moments when the curtain is pulled back on the delicate dance between public relations and the media (which, in this case, stumbled). Not that the stakes are very high (this was just a food event after all). However, the awards purport to be the culinary equivalent of the Oscars, in which case it was just plain weird to find out that the details of the winners and losers were already being made available to some members of the press. In the age of instantaneous communication of news via the Internet, this kind of charade seems all the more retrograde. What do you think of press release embargoes?SIGHTINGS Up close and personal, we saw Martha Stewart, Mario Batali, Daniel Boulud, Jean Georges Vogerichten, Emeril Lagasse, Rick Bayless, and the bearded dude from Anthrax.BEST BITES It would be impossible to recount the details of all of the tasty dishes served post-ceremony, but favorites included Lidia Bastianich's almond flan, Chanterelle's rice pudding with rhubarb, and Charlie Trotter's terrine of morels and fava beans.

Very proud of my client Sunset's win. You should come see the One-Block in question next time you're in town. Just read your bio and saw you grew up in the Gourmet Ghetto. I call those mean streets my home as well. Actually, I'm in the \"upper gourmet ghetto\" e.g., hills above Chez Panisse. See you 'round town.

Controversial Ice Cream Ad May be Excommunicated

A controversial advertising campaign for the ice cream brand Antonio Federici Gelato Italiano brings new meaning to the dessert cliche \"sinfully delicious.\"The sexy ads, which depict a nun and priest on the verge of kissing (while holding a carton of ice cream), is being investigated by a UK advertising standards agency after a complaint was made on the grounds that they are demeaning to people who have chosen a religious vocation. The ads feature the taglines \"submit to temptation\" and \"kiss temptation.\" The food magazine Delicious has refused to run the ads.The ads could be banned by the agency if they are found to violate its advertising code.

Adverts are a strange thing.  I know that they have to be controversial / stupid / etc to get noticed but it seems very few of them actually highlight the product these days.

And yet...here it is on a website (how many others?) and people are talking about it! Great advertising, it still works even if the ads do get pulled.

Unuseless Inventions: Tomatoes That Don't Leak

***CONTENT
To much fanfare, the British supermarket chain Tesco has begun selling the world's first \"non-leaking tomato.\" Grown in Holland, the innovation is being pitched as a major discovery and a critical solution to the problem of soggy sandwiches, which is apparently a big issue in the UK. “The arrival of the non-leaking tomato may well be heralded by sarnie fans as the best thing to hit the sandwich world since sliced bread,\" said Tesco's tomato buyer Emma Pettitt: As one of the most universally used sandwich ingredients the problem is one that affects millions of people every day in the UK.\"According to Pettitt, a standard supermarket tomato will leak 12 percent of its moisture into the bread within an hour of the sandwich being made, while the non-leaking version tomato loses only 3 percent of is moisture. The Guardian's Susan Smillie got her hands on some of the leak-less tomatoes, which to her \"seemed entirely unappealing in theory, and in appearance,\" and took them for a test drive. She found that \"the new tomato seems to live up to its non-sogginess claims. Said tomato is surprisingly juicier than I expected.\" But, why go to such extremes, Smillie wonders, when there already exists a perfectly fine method of keeping your sandwich bread dry:\"Any sandwich maker worth his salt will have a protective layer of lettuce to one side, and cheese to the other, ensuring maximum bouncage of bread. What you might get is slightly limp lettuce, or wet cheese, but if the moisture has penetrated the bread, you're on to a really bad sandwich, and no breed of tomato's going to do anything for that.\"

No mention at all of taste!
The construction of the sandwich makes all the difference. 
When you have to choose between a simple solution and a very complex solution with the chance of unexpected side-effects, which makes more sense.

Such a bizarre world we live in.

At school, it took them two seconds for the chefs (I'm a culinary school student) to show us how to remove the seeds and liquid from a tomato.

Better to get an amazing tomato and do that than to get a tasteless one where that has been done for you.

After all, if it doesn't taste great, no one will eat it.

Cheers!

British Jam, by Way of France

Tea Together, a producer of artisanal jams based in northern France, has just opened its first retail store in Millburn, New Jersey.I caught up with owners Nick and Judith Gifford when the shop opened last month.The British couple started their business 12 years ago after leaving busy careers in film and television production for country life in the northern French village of St. Remy au Bois. Before long, they traded film for food and tried their hand as culinary entrepreneurs.\"We wondered what the English could do better than the French\" said Judith, and they hit upon British traditions of breakfast and tea time as their angle. \"You see,\" she explained. \"The French do everything based on lunch and dinner.\"Seizing an opportunity, they started out baking scones (what could be more British?). When they set up shop at the market, the scones attracted a lot of curiosity from the locals, but few sales. Judith recalled that her French customers were bewildered about what to do with them. \"'But, when would you eat these?' they would ask.\" The scones never took off. They eventually found success at making jam, building a substantial wholesale business with 5-star hotels in major European cities (in the U.S., you can find them at the Chateau Marmont in Los Angeles). French mega-chef Alain Ducasse is a fan.Though the jams may be produced in France and use French ingredients, Judith says they are completely British in style. \"French jams tend towards finesse with all sorts of infusions. We wanted our jams to be strong, clear, and intense.\"And, they are.Pure lemon marmalade, made from the whole fruit, is tart -- bracing even -- but delicious.They may be the best jams I've ever had. Apricot and lavender jam is excellent, as is the syrupy Summer Pudding, brimming with raspberry and black currents, and sweet and tart Damson, blended from the typically British plums the company imports from Kent. Tea Together also makes chutneys, savory blends of fruits, spices, and herbs. Unlike traditional chutneys, these contain no garlic or onions.There are 45 flavors of preserves in all, made mostly from organic fruit, unbleached organic cane sugar, and no pectin or preservatives. The small company is comprised of only 10 people (including the owners), and just four people do all the cooking.Squeezed out by high rents in Manhattan, the Giffords have set up shop for their first retail store in tony Millburn, New Jersey.In addition to preserves, the shop also sells imported olive oils, mustards, varietal honeys, salts, vinegar, and pasta. Dividing the store is a long communal table at which the couple hopes to serve coffee, tea, and bread in the future.Tea Together, 356 Millburn Avenue, Millburn, New Jersey 07041 (973.218.6769).

They started out thinking what could the English do better than the French...funny..but a little insulting to the French, especially when they use French ingredients. Jam sounds divine though - I hope their business takes off and comes to the West Coast soon.

In Season: Green Garlic
***AUTHOR

***CONTENT
While I’ve been getting ready for season two of the square foot garden, I was able to harvest one last crop from last year that I managed to reap after a long, cold Winter.During last fall, I decided to try growing green garlic, the quintessential gastronomic sign of early spring.I broke up a head of garlic into cloves and planted them in one of the squares in the garden. Short green stalks shot up quickly, and then they stopped growing and remained like that for the winter. But, as it started warming up last month, they began growing again. Some of the outer leaves, which had withered and started turning brown, were now joined by new ones that were growing fast. When I yanked them out of the ground, the long stalks were still attached to the original cloves, which had burst open and could now be peeled off. What remained looked a lot like scallions, tinged with purple at the white end and perfumed with the smell of garlic. I tasted a bite. While the smell could trick you into thinking you were putting a piece of raw garlic in your mouth, the taste was much, much milder.I combined the green garlic with butter to make a very simple pasta. Once cooked, the green garlic (surprisingly) tasted nothing like scallions or onions, as I had expected. Rather, they became slightly sweet, like the offspring of garlic and leeks if they mated. I leave it to your imagination to envision what that mating process would look like.Fresh Pasta With Green Garlic1 pound fresh pasta2 tablespoons butter4-5 stalks green garlic, finely slicedsalt (to taste)black pepper, freshly ground (to taste) Parmigiano reggiano, grated (to taste)1. Boil water for the pasta.2. Melt butter in a sauté pan, being careful not to let it brown, and add the green garlic.3. Saute on medium to medium-low heat until the green garlic has softened (but don’t let it brown). Remove from heat.4. Cook the pasta. I used cavatelli, which were frozen and required a longer amount of cooking, so I started them before sauteing the green garlic.5. When the pasta is cooked, drain it (reserve cooking liquid), and set pasta aside.6. Return the saute pan to the range, set to medium to medium-high. When the butter starts to bubble, add about 1/4 cup of the water the pasta cooked in and whisk until the butter and water forms an emulsion. Keep whisking while the butter/water reduces slightly (around a minute).7. Add pasta to the pan and toss, adding more water if too dry, and seasoning with salt and pepper to taste.8. Plate and serve the pasta with grated parmigiano reggiano on top.

The green garlic in the photo look very much like ramps.  Are they one and the same? I'm confused.
Josh
2009-04-30 21:29:02
They do look suspiciously similar (and come into season at the same time), though ramps have a fatter bulb and broad, flat leaves. See this pic to compare:

http://tinyurl.com/dj2m87

I believe ramps have a more distinct flavor (also more intense). Have to admit I've never tried them myself, but don't tell anyone.
DocChuck
2009-05-01 15:55:00
Of course, one can Google ramps if confusion exists.  But you will find that the leaves of ramps (called wild leeks in Upstate New York and Vermont) look nothing like those in this photo.

Ramps, in my opinion, are much stronger (and that's not bad) than green garlic.  Also, ramps are generally smaller in size than are green garlic leaves.

Both are wonderful, used properly.

The New York Times Ate My Slogan
***AUTHOR
Josh Friedland
***DATE
2009-04-22 00:00:00
***CONTENT
You may have noticed that The Food Section logo looks a little scantily clad. Gone is the subheading/tagline \"All the News That's Fit to Eat,\" a parody of the New York Times' famous slogan, \"All The News That's Fit to Print.\" Two days ago, I had the surprise of receiving a cease and desist letter from the New York Times demanding that I immediately remove the \"All the News That's Fit to Eat\" tagline because, in their words, the \"use of this similar slogan capitalizes on the good will and reputation associated with the Times's trademark and constitutes trademark dilution and infringement.\" Since I have neither the resources, time, or energy to defend myself against the risk of a lawsuit, I regret to inform you that I decided to cave in.However, I remain perplexed as to why the Times decided to pick on me. I couldn't be the first person to create a spin on the Times slogan. Even a cursory google search of the phrase \"all the news that's fit to\" will produce more than 750,000 results -- web site slogans, article titles, books, and even a couple of music albums. Take theyankeeuniverse.com (\"All The Yankees News That's Fit to Print\"), for example, or prrag.com (\"All the news that's fit to spin\"), or thebrushback.com (\"All the sports news that's fit to print\"). Here's just a small sample of the many words that have been transposed with \"print\": ridicule, byte, fund, aggregate, depress, strip, censor, trip, tint, fake, and dis (my own personal favorite).All the News That's Fit to Sell, a book published by the venerable Princeton University Press, is for sale on Amazon, not to mention All the Art That's Fit to Print (And Some That Wasn't) and All the Math That's Fit to Print. In the field of music, there's folk singer Phil Ochs 1964 album, All the News That's Fit to Sing; lesser known is the Mulchmen's release All the News That's Fit to Surf!I could go on and on. But, if I've learned anything from my googling, it's that my attempt at parody was not so original. In fact, the idea of parodying \"All the News That's Fit to Print\" turn out to be one of the more hackneyed forms of expression in our popular culture. It's the \"Mad Libs\" of cliches.The irony of all this is that not only is \"All the News That's Fit to Eat\" so obviously a parody, this entire web site is a play on the established food media.So, was I annoyed when I first heard from the New York Times? Of course. And, I still am angry. But, I have realized that there's another way of looking at this entire episode. That the Times would take this little one-man operation so seriously that it would marshal its legal department against my alleged \"dilution\" of its brand tells me that the New York Times is paying attention to The Food Section, and that's a good thing. In a backhanded way, it's really very flattering.

You're in good company if that's any comfort. In the 1980s, the Times went after a computer game company called Infocom, which published a fan newsletter called The New Zork Times, Zork being the name of its flagship game. NYT actually sued over that one as if anyone would be confused....More at the URL below.

As Dave said, the Times & other newspapers are going through rough times. I think they've decided to wage war on online mediums including blogs who are growing in popularity. Just look at the silly shenanigans the AP is up to with regards to Google & bloggers. 

The good news is that you probably showed up on the NYT's radar because your readership is growing & they're afraid at some point you'll be a real threat. So in that regard, congratulations!

Wishing you continued success!

Amazing, isn't it, that an enterprise so dependent upon freedom of expression can be so disrespectful of the principle where others are concerned? I understand your desire not to risk a fight, believe me, but I highly doubt they would actually press such an idiotic claim. It's lawyering by threat, and as a lawyer myself, it makes me puke when my colleagues besmirch the profession in this manner.

It's funny that they think that you're not allowed to use a variation of their tagline ... but you are allowed to use an opinion of them as your tagline. So just change it to \"The NYTimes is a bunch of poopyheads who won't let me say that my news is fit to eat.\"

Allen
2009-04-22 16:27:50
Yes, well, you're also copying their section headings, fonts and design, besides just the slogan.  Indeed, if I said \"You tried as hard as possible to make your blog resemble a section of the NY Times newspaper\", that would be no less than the truth, would it not?

So it's hard to have any real sympathy for you.  You were trying to attract their attention, and you succeeded.  Congratulations.

I recognize that this seems like overkill (and it probably is).  But trademarks have to be policed and defended or they can be lost (or at least diminished in scope and value).  Because the NYT's trademark is famous and therefore can be diluted by use of similar or parodic marks in non-competing fields (as opposed to \"infringed\", which would require some hint at likely consumer confusion), they kinda have to police the mark.  It's an almost automatic function at most large companies -- you just got caught in the crosshairs this time around.  

Not that any of that is much consolation, but it's almost certain that it wasn't personal.  Someone else will get the cease and desist (which we in the trade call \"nastygrams\") next time.
Jake
2009-04-22 16:43:17
Yeah, how could they do such a thing to someone who designed their page to look exactly like the New York Times! With nothing obvious to indicate it isn't the Times? Let's see some more hard-hitting google journalism on that.
Yvo
2009-04-22 16:44:48
Ech... that really sucks.  I have to say this reminds me the milk commission (or whatever they're called) going after this woman's site promoting breast feeding... she'd created t-shirts with slogans on it that said, I believe \"Got (breast)milk?\" possibly with boobies on it... and I think she had other t shirts that parodied pork being the other white meat?  I forget exactly, but she was really mad - but then she was kind of making a profit off the slogans... so it's slightly different.  I realize you run ads on here but... I don't know.

PS Seth Green is a total expert on parody laws... you should talk to him.  I bet he'd have a solid defense for you.

A New Player in Recipe Search

***CONTENT
Scripps Networks, the parent company of The Food Network, has quietly launched a new website that might just be a \"killer app\" for online recipe search. Currently in \"beta,\" Food.com sports a clean, almost zen design -- lots of white space, a bunch of carrots, a sprig of rosemary -- which stands in stark contrast to the brash style of its sibling site, the Food Network. Food.com is a vertical search engine for recipes and an online repository for recipe collections. Down the road, Scripps also plans to add social media tools to enable commentary and interaction between users.Surprisingly, it's not just a search engine for Scripps' proprietary recipes on the Food Network website and Recipezaar (which Scripps also owns). Rather, Food.com searches all of the major recipe publishers on the web -- from epicurious to Food & Wine (it presently skips over blogs). Unlike these other sites, which search only within their own sites, Food.com's search has no walls. Aside from FoodieView, I believe it's the only recipe search engine of its kind. Using the Food.com website (or a downloadable toolbar), you may select among sites such as epicurious, gourmet.com, Bon Appetit, CHOW, and other outlets, to search for recipes. Enter search terms and Food.com will display the results from all of the sites in a single, scrollable list. Recipe results and searches may also be filtered by variables such as the type of course, cuisine, main ingredient, technique, special diet, and cooking time. Interestingly, Food.com doesn't only list recipe titles from the other recipe sites. It generates a thumbnail photo and -- here's what's unusual -- scrapes the entire ingredient lists as well (see screenshot, right). A link is provided for the user to go to the recipe owner's site for the complete instructions. While ingredient lists are generally understood to be copyright-free, and traffic will ultimately be directed to the recipe owners' sites, this seems like a game-changer for recipe search, and I am very curious to see how the other publishers will respond. Food.com also has a bookmarking feature which enables user's to \"add\" recipes to your \"recipe box\" from other sites not included in the recipe search collection. It's a little clunky right now. The function only works for those sites food.com has \"white-listed\" (the developers told me more sites are being added all the time). Moreover, by adding a recipe from one of these outside sites, Food.com currently only logs the URL and none of the rich information offered on a search of the major publishers.So, is food.com a game changer? It would seem to eliminate the need to go around from site to site searching for recipes, and it also provides a single place to \"store\" recipes found online. Moreover, scraping the ingredient lists allows for a time-saving way to skim through recipes and compare their complexity. What do you think?

It's nice to have but I don't think I'll be using it too often. I generally prefer to look for recipes from sources I like and trust. Some of these sites have very different characters. Recipezaar, for example, has a lot of stuff I would never in a million years want to cook -- knock-off Olive Garden recipes and that sort of thing -- it's just more information to sift through, to have their recipes mixed in with ones from sites I like.

food.com isn't the only one doing this. Project Foodie (http://www.projectfoodie.com) has been around for about 2 years. 

We have similar sources and features, but we also index by publication date so, for example, you can see all recipes published in a specific issue of a magazine.

This site is removing (or at least obscuring) editorial filters that have real value. Also: 90% of the recipes accessible in beta are from RecipeZaar (ie pretty much worthless).

I like the idea of it but execution leaves something to be desired. I don't like that I am unable to open up recipes in new tabs, since I like to open up a bunch of recipes at once. This going to a recipe, clicking the back button, going to another recipe thing is way too slow. Also, there doesn't seem to be a way to exclude words or ingredients from searches, which Google does much better. For example I was searching for an Indian-spiced whole roast chicken recipe, but could find no way to exclude words like thighs or pieces or breasts.

Take a look at springpad, also currently in \"beta\" - online notebooks to help manage your life.  http://springpadit.com


You can drop in the URL for ANY recipe & the site will scrape the ingredients for you & also store a link back to the original source for later.


The weekly meal planner allows users to add recipe to specific dates & easily create shopping lists.  There's a new recipe box feature under development, too!

I'd like to know other people's thoughts are on whether or not they participate in the foodie communities (comments, ratings)? Or are they more interested in finding great recipes?  What I've found to be the best recipe search engine is http://www.RecipeBridge.com  They claim to have over 200+ cooking sites, blogs, and magazines indexed for over 1.4 million recipes right now.  Sam, to your point it's the only site that seems to have figured out how to prevent RecipeZaar recipes from dominating the search results.
Cheers!

I also really like Recipe Bridge (http://www.recipebridge.com).  I've been using it quite a bit lately and have found it to be easy AND comprehensive.  A number of times, I've been looking for a recipe that I've made in past but have misplaced.  Recipe Bridge has always found the recipe I was looking for.  It's been a lifesaver.

Nice post, Josh!  I agree with Anonymous_Crab and Sam about the quality of these engines.  

As far game changing goes, I think it will hurt food blogs down the road by reducing traffic to blogs, as it is positioning itself to be a \"go to\" source and is currently excluding blogs.  It appears to be a subtle way of positioning the food-related publications - united - as  \"one voice.\"  

It is exactly the type of marketing effort I would come up with, if I were the marketing consultant to these publications - it's brilliant!  Its success will ultimately depend on how they market to the general population.  It is likely to become popular those who are not so discerning or research oriented, and want a one stop shop (i.e., most of the general population). 

If this takes off with enough marketing behind it, the food blogging community will ultimately need to come up with its own version to adequately compete, which I think is a brilliant idea anyway.  Now THAT is a search engine I would use everyday!

Bill and Andy:  www.recipebridge.com sounds cool.  I will check it out next - thanks!

Cheers,

Good content. Just wanted to add some buying advice for those on a budget.

There is a huge market for sports shoes but what’s significant is the genuineness of the shoes we intend to buy. Most often we think that a pair of authentic shoes would cost us big money and so we turn to fake shoes which are available at very low prices not realizing the consequences of wearing them in the long run.

However, you will be happy to know that you can still get genuine sports shoes at cheap prices. The only thing that we require is a little bit of research to know which stores stock original stuff and offer good discounts that make genuine shoes affordable and fit our budget. So spend sometime and research online to find where you can shop around, how you can shop and when is the best time to shop.

From Bamboo to Cork

***CONTENT
Bambu, the maker of bamboo kitchen tools and serving pieces, has launched a new line of products made from another renewable material, cork.The earthy material has been pressed into a number of modern designs for bowls, cutting boards, and serving trays. The high-density cork products are lightweight and surprisingly impervious to liquids, and, according to the company, naturally anti-microbial and anti-fungal. Bambu claims the product line is \"the world's first cork tabletop collection.\"I recently gave the cork cutting boards a test drive. Unlike wood (and, particularly, synthetic) cutting boards, the cork boards have a naturally spongy consistency that works like a shock absorber, cushioning the knife (and your wrist) with each slice. They also clean up well, which was a surprise, since I expected the cork would be particularly vulnerable to staining. Juice from freshly cut strawberries left no permanent marks. While there's a benefit to the extremely light weight of the cork boards -- very easy to haul out from the cabinet -- the boards weren't ideal for more difficult cutting maneuvers. For example, the board tended to slip when I worked at splitting and breaking down a whole chicken into parts. A heftier board would have been more effective and reliable.And though the cork does have a natural \"healing\" property that closes up cuts made by a knife, I would be concerned that the occasional misguided slice would end up producing divots, diminishing how long the boards will last over time. Serrated knives would certainly be a no-no.So, while I wouldn't replace my cutting boards with cork ones, they're a welcome addition for those cutting tasks to which they are best suited.Bambu's collection of cork bowls, cutting boards, and serving trays are available at branchhome.com.

Passover Postscript: Pecan Crisps and a Mexican Chocolate-Pecan Cake

***CONTENT
I ended up making two desserts this year for Passover. Although I've had a pretty good track record in the previous years, I like the challenge of trying something new, particularly on this flour-challenged holiday, and went with Gourmet's crunchy pecan cookies and Patricia Jinich's flourless chocolate-pecan cake.The pecan cookies were very easy to make (and you really wouldn't suffer eating them any time of year). They contain no flour or matzo meal, just sugar, pecans, cinnamon, potato starch and egg whites. The nutty cookies, enlivened by the cinnamon, are thin, light, and crisp.The recipe indicates that you can make them in advance and store them for up to a week. I made them the same day as the seder, but I would actually recommend baking them earlier. After a couple of days, the cookies lost any chewiness and became completely crunchy (which I preferred).Jinich's cake is a surprising variation of the ubiquitous flourless chocolate cake: a Mexican take on the dessert topped with fresh berries, lime, and sugar. The recipe was a winner. Unlike other flourless chocolate cakes I've eaten, this one wasn't dense or overly rich, which is usually the case.Preparing the cake was shockingly simple (once you melt the chocolate, everything can be combined together in a blender or food processor). And, the topping is incredibly delicious: tangy from the lime juice and zest, and sweet from the blackberries, strawberries, and piloncillo sugar (or brown sugar, which I used). This flavor combination would be amazing as a sorbet or the basis for sweet-tart cocktailI did run into some confusion about how long to let the fruit macerate in the sugar and citrus juice. The recipe, did not indicate exactly how long was appropriate. If I combined it too early, would it be too soggy? Or, did the topping need some time to draw the juice out of the fruit and become something closer to a sauce and less like a fruit salad.Amazingly, I was able to reach Jinich via her blog, Pati's Mexican Table, catching up with her while she was riding a train through the Copper Canyon in Chihuahua, Mexico. She wrote in an email that the topping may be mixed as far as 12 hours in advance (but not more, lest it get mushy): \"I like it best just a couple of hours before, so some juices come out and the fruit absorbs flavors from lime peel, juice and sugar or piloncillo. Consistency should still be firm and give you a bit of a crunch.\"While I had her ear, I also asked her about how finely to grind the pecans (I think I could have ground mine finer). \"It becomes fluffier the finer they are,\" she wrote. \"I like it better like that. But some people like to feel the crunch of the pecans, and have it with more texture. You can play with it!\" Nana José's Chocolate Pecan CakeBy Patricia JinichThe Cake:1/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon unsalted butter or pareve margarine6 ounces bittersweet chocolate1 cup pecans6 large eggs1 teaspoon vanilla extract1 cup sugarDash of saltThe Topping:3 tablespoons grated piloncillo sugar or brown sugarFinely grated zest of 1 limeJuice of 2 limes (approx. 1/4 cup juice)1 pint strawberries, washed, hulled and halved1 pint blackberriesWhipped cream, optional. 1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Line a 9-inch springform pan with parchment paper and grease with 1 tablespoon butter.2. Using a double boiler or pan over simmering water, melt together chocolate and remaining 1/4 cup butter. Set aside to cool. 3. Using a blender, chop pecans finely (to taste). Add eggs, vanilla, sugar, salt and melted chocolate mixture, blending until smooth. Pour batter into pan and bake until a toothpick inserted in center comes out clean, 40 to 45 minutes; cake should be moist but not wet. Allow to cool.4. For the topping: In a large mixing bowl, combine piloncillo or brown sugar, lime zest and lime juice. Add strawberries and blackberries, and toss gently (this may be done up to 12 hours in advance; keep refrigerated). Just before serving, toss again and spoon on top of cake. Serve with whipped cream (optional).Recipe published with the permission of the author.

Scenes from a White House Seder

***CONTENT
The White House has released this photo of the historic White House seder, the first ever attended by a sitting President. The specifics of the meal are scant. Nevertheless, it is possible to discern a couple of interesting details. A close-up analysis of the official photo reveals that the choice of haggadah was cheap and utilitarian (and, presumably, an unintentional product placement). Eschewing a modern reinterpretation like the contemplative A Passover Haggadah (interspersed with commentary from Elie Wiesel), the White House seder went instead with the ubiquitous Maxwell House Haggadah, a supermarket freebie (complimentary with a can of Maxwell House coffee since 1933). Also notable is that it looks like each guest got their own personal seder plate to refer to during the ceremony. A great idea, I think, except for all of the egg-roasting involved. For more information about the event, the Huffington Post has a detailed report on who exactly is sitting around the table, which included President Obama, first Lady Michelle Obama, the first daughters, and senior adviser Valerie Jarrett, among other friends and White House staff.

I didn't know that Maxwell House published a Haggadah (guess it's only in the U.S. and I'm in Canada) until last night. The story of its origins that I heard was that a lot of Jews were giving up coffee during passover because they thought that coffee, being from a bean, wasn't kosher for passover. Maxwell House sought to get the Jews drinking coffee during passover by marketing a hagaddah.

Sounds like a campaign out of Mad Men.

One of the most amazing scenes of the Obama first 100 days.  I too give him a lot of credit for hosting a Seder meal.  This is also a good education for his children.  My mother used to have a Seder meal when I was a teenager and we're Christian.  Props for Mr. President...!

A haggadah is like a program for the seder dinner. At every seder, we discuss the story of Passover and the haggadah includes the story, readings about Passover and often songs.

I grew up only knowing of Maxwell House haggadahs. I didn't even realize there were non-branded versions!

Seder is a ritual that is familiar and comforting for those who celebrate Passover every year.  This is when the leader (President Obama, or in most families DAD) asks the questions of the children or other folks at the table such as \"Why is this night different from all other nights?\" And the child either recites from the Haggadah or from memory the answer.  In this way the tradition is passed down from father to children and to non-Jews (like me!) who are invited to participate (part of the ritual).  I learned to eat horseradish (bitter herb)and gefiltefish(sp)and unlevened bread or matzo.  A lovely and meaningful ritual and I wish I knew a family who would ask me to join their Seder now.

We too celebrated our Passover Seder in the Philippines as enlightened completed Talmidim of Yeshua recognizing him as the Lamb of G-d that was slain for our redemption(Isaiah 53. It is through his shed blood that eternal death passed/ passes over us and brings us into life here and in eternity, when we believe in his finished redemptive work on the cross. He is coming back soon for his own as the Conquering King of kings. Maranatha! \"Come, let us reason together says Adonai...\"

No mention that Jesus was cruxified on Passover. First Fruits of Zion (ffoz.com? .org?) has an appropriate haggadah for Christian Passover Seders. Maybe next year at the Wite House. FYI. Passover/Pesach never lands on a Friday and during Jesus' lifetime Friday was also a Sabbath (see Luke 6:1 KJV mention of this Friday \"first\" Sabbath). Therefore, Jesus was not cruxified on a Friday. Holy Week should, instead, be with a Good Thursday and a Maundy Wednesday as it was this year.

I think it's cool that they used the Maxwell Housew Hagaddahs.  Very traditionally American.  These are the Hagaddahs of my childhood Pesach seders.

This may be the first seder held in the White House but Obama is not the first sitting President to attend one. Jimmy Carter attended a seder his first year in the White House.

We grew up using the Maxwell House Haggadah -- the grey  hardback ones. This was in Huntington, WV in the 50 and 60s, and I don't think we had many choices then. Sitting around the table with my mother's family there were a lot more of us than in this picture. My father led a speed reading.

Mark--um, what kind of whacky Jews for Jesus stuff is this?  Passover falls on a \"secular\" Friday all the time.  AND it also falls on Shabbot.  Hype-and-agenda free facts available courtesy of Google, starting here.

And yeah I remember the Maxwell House Haggadah.  My family has a small collection of various ones from different shuls, and I have a copy of a hand-lettered one done by a co-worker's late father (he was an illustrator in the 50's).

My family has always used the \"Silverman\" Haggadah, which i think is terrific. This year one of our guests brought a signed copy of Ben Shahn's illustrated Haggadah, which was wonderful to see.


I think it's a shame that at this historic White House seder they chose to use the Maxwell House haggadah, which is really one of the worst out there.


There are quite a lot of fantastic haggadahs out there that would have been far more interesting to the President and his guests, including many that are child-friendly. For a nice review, check out:

My family moved from Brooklyn to Kentucky in the 1920. I was born in 1931 and as a child I can recall many times reading from a Haggadah during a Seder. Our Seders were attended by anywhere from 6 to 28 family members. We had several haggadahas including the one from Maxwell House and alternated using them.

several comments,  starting with my one negative,  to Beth and the ones who commented on her post.  There are no real Jews for Jesus.  there are Apostates who were Jewish but who are now Christian. 

 Now on the topic.  I think that the idea of having a Seder in the White House was a nice idea.  one of the main themes of the Seder is inclusiveness \"Let all who are hungry, come and eat.\"  Also it is a time to include the \"Strangers\" (Not family member) so that we remember that we were strangers in the land of Egypt at one point in time. 

The purpose of the Seder is to teach the story of how we came to be in Egypt, How we came to be enslaved. What slavery entailed.  How we gained our freedom.  How we came to our historical homeland.  The Seder helps us to understand that we are still connected to those who came before us. 

I think that having children learn their own customs, and share them with other children is important.  The Christian children in our own neighborhood were invited to participate in our holidays where it was appropriate;  my very Jewish children went to their Catholic and Protestants home to participate in their holidays where appropriate.  As a result we have knowledgeable adult children who have an understanding of, and respect for each others religious practices.  And if we had had Muslims in our neighborhood they would have been included also.  

On the Maxwell house Hagadah. it was started in the 30's as a giveaway with purchase. At a time when money was scarce,  it afforded many people to have more Hagadahs. At a time when extended families were huge, that was a real blessing. and it hasn't been updated. Over the past 45 years we have collected many, many different Hagadahs.

Another great modern Hagaddah, especially for all the \"JewBus\" out there, is the Hagaddah for Jews and Buddhists -- a bit new age-y, but very meaningful - I recommend it!

Is Quinoa Kosher for Passover?

***CONTENT
One would assume that quinoa would not pass muster for Passover. After all, wheat and other grains (categorized as chametz) are forbidden during the holiday. Moreover, medieval Ashkenazi rabbis also excluded the consumption of kitniyot -- rice, corn, soy beans, and other foods -- might be confused with the forbidden grains or grown near them and possibly comingled.Though similar to chametz grains, it turns out that quinoa is not technically a grain (it's actually a member of the \"goose foot\" family, which includes beets and spinach). In addition, as a new world food, quinoa wasn't even on the radar screen of 15th century rabbis who made determinations about kitniyot and Passover.So, as long as the quinoa is processed in a in a factory with Kosher for Passover certification, it is generally considered to be part of the Passover diet.

Test Kitchen: Suzanne Goin's Creamsicle Floats

***CONTENT
If there was one thing that stood out for me from the New York Times' recent battle of the budget dinner parties, it was the creamsicle floats which Julia Moskin made for her dessert. The recipe, which comes from L.A. chef Suzanne Goin, is barely that -- just a combination of three ingredients: vanilla ice cream, fresh tangerine juice, and seltzer.I loved the way the tart flavor of the tangerine juice was offset by the creamy vanilla ice cream (store-bought in my re-creation, though the recipe calls for homemade).The complete recipe (which serves 6) is available online at the Times website. To make a single serving, add one scoop of vanilla ice cream to a glass with approximately 1/2 cup fresh tangerine juice (about the juice of two tangerines) and top with seltzer (be careful, it foams up). Serve with a straw and a spoon.The recipe got me thinking about other juice/ice cream combinations that might make for delicious floats. If you have any suggestions, leave a comment below.

In Puglia, Southern Italy, we have two very popular ice cream combinations.
The first one is called \"Nocciolino\", which in Italian means the \"little hazelnut\". The recipe is just the combination of: warm espresso (two shots or very long, served in a large cup); and a scoop of hazelnut ice cream.
The combination of the warm coffee with the cold icecream is fantastic!!
The second is called the \"affogato\", which in Italian means \"soaked\". The recipe is just the combination of: truffle chocolate icream, half a glass of Italian Amaro liquor (i.e. Fernet Branca, made with herbs), toasted almonds on top. Again the conbination of the bitter liquor with the truffle chocolate are sublime...
hope you like them....

I haven't tried this but ever since I was a kid I would pour buttermilk into half a glass of orange juice.  No one would believe me that it tastes just like a creamcicle.  (I don't stir--that way you keep getting a different hit of flavor as you sip.)

Why is this woman using sex to sell food allowed on TV but the PETA women simulating sex with veggies banned (from the Superbowl, no less)?  Why I am even asking this?  All one has to do is see the big honking piece of meat next to the big honking hooters, then think about who decides what is allowed on TV or not and there you have it- Big Brother is not only watching, he's deciding what you get to watch as well.

I don't see anything wrong with making food sexy. True, it is a little ridiculous and over the top to get so \"hot\" over a burger but she's attractive, the burger looks good and I'm sure Carl's Jr. is benefiting from all this exposure.

Life is sexy. So what? Would we want it any other way? We can add any meaning we want to that commercial but some women are that sexy. They feel it, look it and every thing they do exudes it. Its a good thing not a bad thing. Now that ad can be manipulated by anyone to mean anything.

People that age in particular have a lot of sexuality that they are feeling. Very normal human stuff and it is the year 2009 folks.

Local Food Shopping for the iPhone

***CONTENT
Serious Eats points to Locavore, an interesting new iPhone app that attempts to add a sheen of high-tech cool-ness to the otherwise mundane task of searching for local seasonal foods.Locavorism...on the iPhone? I gave it a test drive.After you download the app, the software identifies your GPS location and pulls up a list of foods currently in season. This can be depressing if its March and you're in New Jersey (the app, sadly, displays \"nothing is currently in season here\"). But, there is something to look forward to: asparagus, peas, and other green things are shown under another list, \"Coming in season soon.\" Yes! Click on asparagus, and a map of the U.S. springs up showing those sunnier states where spring vegetables might actually be growing, plus links to epicurious (for recipes) and wikipedia. You can also search for specific types of fruits and vegetables (or browse alphabetically) to see when and where they are in season. Click on \"markets\" and Locavore takes you to a list of farmers markets in your area in order of distance from you (oddly, in my case, the market closest to me was listed second). Click on a listing, and a new page gives more details about the market (provided by the localharvest.org). I pulled up my local market in Maplewood, New Jersey, but found out very little (in fact, the page indicated the listing was last updated in 2000 and \"is likely to be out of date.\"). Harrumph!So, the application didn't pan out as being all that useful for me. While I liked seeing current information on what's fresh in my area (this always inspires cooking), even better would be real details on exactly those markets where specific items are available and plentiful (could you imagine what this would do for rampophiles?). Not to mention, how about details on the farms that are selling at these markets (and other retail locations where you might find their goods). I'd also love to see listings for where you can find local meats. As far as the local food movement has come in recent years, I still find that shopping for meats raised locally is very difficult (particularly since they aren't sold in my tiny local market).So, give Locavore a try if you'd like. It's a worthy attempt at making local food shopping iPhone-friendly, though its going to need some improvements before it can achieve the greatness of iPint.Locavore is $2.99 at the App Store on iTunes.

Researchers are looking at mussels -- and their impressive ability to stick to things -- to find ways of creating a new generation of bandages and medical adhesives.Less than satisfied with the effectiveness of man-made medical \"glues\" at bonding human tissue -- not to mention their susceptibility to contamination -- Wired reports that chemists are studying how mussels are able to cling so well to rocks, wood, and other materials, particularly in a wet environment.\"The interface between ocean and land has been an important zone in evolutionary history,\" University of Utah biochemist Russell Stewart told Wired. \"Marine organisms exploit multiple bonding mechanisms. By using multiple chemical bonds, they're able to bond to multiple substrates.\"Chemists have even created a prototype bandage using an inkjet printer filled with adhesive proteins taken from mussels. However, artificially replicating how the proteins are structured in mussels' natural adhesive -- key to its strength -- remains a major scientific challenge.

The blade is configured to mix ingredients horizontally and vertically, directing the contents downward and wiping the bowl clean as it rotates. Its creators also claim that it allows chunky ingredients to be mixed easily without being crushed or jammed against the bowl. $24.95 to $29.95, depending on the size blade that will fit your mixer model, at the SideSwipe Store.

I have had one of these for about a  year.  It does work quite well!  There's one caveat: When installing it (the directions do state this) you must raise the height of the adjustment screw a bit by taking a screwdriver to your mixer - which alone, isn't too much of a big deal. But, when you want to use a different mixer attachment - like the wire whip - you'll then need to get out the old screwdriver again and lower the adjustment screw, because otherwise the wire whip won't reach the bottom of the bowl. Basically, it takes a few extra steps and some trial and error to switch attachments.  Food for thought.  ;)

Winegrowers in Provence are angered over European Union plans to allow vintners to make rosé wine by mixing together red and white wines.Rosé is traditionally made by leaving the skins of red wine grapes to macerate with the juice for a short time, which tints the wine pink. The solids are then removed.Provencal vintners are lobbying President Nicolas Sarkozy's government to try to block the EU move, claiming that allowing producers to make rose by any other method would destroy a local tradition. The proposal will be put to a final vote by EU members on April 27.

I find it interesting that people are trying to \"block\" this movement. Why not just allow it? People would still know what the tradition is and actually might be more inclined to buy the \"real\" kind of rose.

Hamantaschen: It's All in the Stirring
***AUTHOR

***CONTENT
I won't bore you with the story of Purim (though it is a good one). What's more relevant to this site are the holiday's traditional cookies, Hamantaschen. Sometimes they're huge and sometimes their small, but they are always shaped in triangles and typically filled with either jam or a poppy seed concoction not to my taste. I never made them before, but decided to give them a try this year. It was also an experiment in baking with my daughter (which is all the rage these days). She seemed to have fun helping me, except her attention span only lasted for about two cooking steps (the high point being anything involving filling measuring cups and emptying them). After that, she pretty much wanted to strip off her apron and get in a Cinderella dress. I hunted for recipes and settled on one from cookie authority Maida Heatter (see below for recipe) and made two batches: One with the filling in Heatter's recipe (a combination of apricots, prunes, walnuts, and honey) and another batch filled with Amy Scattergood's recipe for homemade Nutella. The homemade Nutella doesn't really resemble the real thing. But, that doesn't mean it it's not tasty. Made from ground, toasted hazelnuts, sugar, and cocoa, it's much more like a chocolate-enhanced nut butter as compared to a hazelnut-flavored chocolate spread (which is what Nutella tastes like to me). The fruit filing came together nicely. You cook dried apricots and prunes and walnuts together with a little water until it becomes thick and jammy. Then add the honey. Easy. The dough was another story. Mine turned out dry, crumbly, and barely sticking together. With just 1/4 cup of butter, one egg, and 1 1/2 tablespoons of orange juice, it didn't bind. (It seemed like the recipe should have called for more butter, eggs, juice, or something). But, I went ahead and wrapped it up it tightly in plastic wrap, hoping that after a night in the refrigerator, it would be fine. The problem may have been in my technique, not the proportions. A reader, Judy Levin, emailed me to tell me that it's critical to carefully stir the dough -- as the recipe instructs -- In Judy's own words: Stir for at least 10 minutes. It may seem like a long time but it’s necessary to completely coat the flour. Don’t be tempted to add more OJ as I have done over the years. It doesn’t really need more. Use a FORK to stir and when all the pieces of dough are coated, test it by squeezing a piece of dough between your fingers. Before you take the dough out of your bowl, make sure there are no dry pieces in the bottom, if there are, you didn’t mix long enough. Once all of the dough looks moist, it still won’t look like a ball of dough in the bowl but it will be ready. Turn the dough out onto a piece of wax paper and push the dough together using the wax paper, not your hands. It will come together beautifully, smooth and moist. It took me a long time to get it right so don’t feel bad if it wasn’t perfect on your first try. The first time I tried this recipe I thought that 1 ½ tbsp of OJ couldn’t possibly be enough liquid. Trust Maida, she was right. Lesson learned. Don't mix the dough in a food processor. Nevertheless, it did improve after chilling, though it was still pretty dry, crumbly, and now hard, to boot. Nevertheless, I was able roll it out in pieces, cut out rounds, and fill the cookies. The sides of the cookies tended to break as I turned them up to form the triangles. But, with some pinching here and there, they all came together. Despite my dough problems, the cookies came out perfectly fine (and even tasted better the next day). And there's also plenty of the fruit filling and homemade Nutella left over to keep enjoying even after the cookies disappear. HamantaschenFrom Maida Heatter's Book of Great Cookies (Knopf, 1977)By Maida Heatter Makes 27 cookies PASTRY2 cup sifted all-purpose flour2 teaspoons double-acting baking powder1/4 teaspoon salt3/4 cup granulated sugar1/4 lb (1 stick) butter, cold and firm1 eggFinely grated rind of 1 bright-colored orange1 1/2 tablespoonsl orange juice Sift together, into a large mixing bowl, the flour, baking powder, salt, and sugar. Cut the butter into 1/2-inch slices, and with a pastry blender, cut it into the dry ingredients until the particles are fine and the mixture resembles coarse meal. Beat the egg lightly just to mix. Stir the egg, orange rind, and juice into the dough. Mix thoroughly and then stir well until the dough is completely moistened and smooth. Wrap in wax paper or plastic wrap, flatten the dough slightly, and refrigerate overnight. The filling may be made the next day or it may be made ahead of time and kept at room temperature for a day or two or refrigerated for a longer time. FILLING12 ounces unsweetened dried pitted prunes (about 2 cups, lightly packed)6 ounces unsweetened dried apricots (about 1 cup, lightly packed)1 cup water1 tablespoon lemon juice1/2 cup honey [these are better with a mild clover honey than with a strongly flavored one]2 1/2 ounces (3/4 cup) walnuts, cut into medium-size pieces Cut the prunes and apricots into small pieces. Place them in a saucepan with the water. Bring to a boil, cover, and lower the heat so that they just simmer for 10 to 15 minutes until very soft. (Some fruits are drier than others -- if the water evaporates before the fruit is soft add another spoon or two of water and cook a bit longer.) Add the lemon juice and honey. Cook, stirring almost constantly, for about 5 minutes (it should not get too thick; it will thicken more while cooling). Stir in the nuts and set aside to cool. When you are ready to bake, adjust two racks to divide the oven into thirds and preheat to 400 deg. Cut aluminum foil to fit cookie sheets. Work with half the pastry at a time; refrigerate the other half. Work quickly or the dough will become sticky. On a floured pastry cloth with a floured rolling pin, roll out the dough, turning it over occasionally to keep both sides floured. Roll it to an even 1/8-inch thickness (that is thin but be careful -- if you roll the dough too thin, it will be hard to handle). With a plain round 3-inch cookie cutter, cut the dough into rounds. (Reserve the scraps of dough, press them together, and rechill until firm enough to roll.) Hold one round in your hand. Place a rounded teaspoonful of the filling in the center, mounding it rather high -- it will not run out in baking. Fold up two sides of the dough -- each side should be a third of the circle -- and pinch them together where they meet, forming a triangle and leaving a generous opening at the top. The filling should extend above the top of the pastry. (If the rounds of pastry become soft or sticky before you shape them, transfer then with a wide metal spatula to a tray or cookie sheet and chill briefly in the freezer or refrigerator only until they are firm enough to handle.) Place the Hamantaschen 1 1/2 to 2 inches apart on the cut foil. Slide cookie sheets under the pieces of foil. Bake for 12 to 15 minutes until the cookies are barely colored on the sides, slightly darker on the edges. Reverse the sheets top to bottom and front to back to insure even browning. If you bake only one sheet at a time bake it high in the oven. With a wide metal spatula, transfer the Hamantaschen to racks to cool, or serve them warm. If anyone is in the kitchen with me when I bake these, very few if any actually have a chance to cool. Reprinted with permission from the publisher.

The doughs with cream cheese in them are a lot better than the butter cookie methods like the one you've described. They end up much more flavorful and tender.

We always have used a sugar cookie recipe that came out of some very old cookbook my mother had.  It's pretty sticky, which is the good and the bad. (Plus, you get a sweet, tasty cookie, which doesn't always happen with hamentashen)  Cream cheese base sounds interesting, though.

She gives three different dough recipes as well as simple recipes for prune, poppy, apricot and cherry fillings. I make a double batch every year, and they fly off my counter with astonishing speed.

I have to say that this is a terrific marketing idea. I hate thinking about all of the emulsifiers and chemically altered shelf-life-improving ingredients that are in the typical pint of ice cream- which is why we usually make our own. (Plus you can't get Bourbon Caramel Pecan in the store!) This is a concept I would try on a late night ice cream run.

I was interested to see that regular Haagen Dazs Coffee Ice Cream also has just five ingredients.  Does this one have less butterfat, because it is lower in calories?

I was intrigued by the concept so I bought the vanilla bean five. I MUCH prefer Haagen-Dazs regular vanilla, which also only contains 5 ingredients, but has much better flavor and mouth-feel.

it was as bad as industrial ice-cream can be. 
for a 5% fat artisanal gelato is much tastier and natural. It's worth your money much more than a Kg of Haagen Dazs five.

If you stayed up until the bitter end of the Oscar broadcast last night, you may have caught a brief glimpse of \"Julie & Julia,\" the upcoming film adaptation of Julie Powell's book of the same name (which was, of course, an adaptation of her blog, The Julie/Julia Project). Scenes (well, nine seconds, to be precise) from the film were briefly shown as part of a montage of movies due out in 2009, and thanks to YouTube, a fuzzy clip is already online. According to IMDB, the film is slated to open in theaters in the U.S. on August 7.

Greenwashing, Chipotle, and Food Choices

***DATE

***CONTENT
An interview with Mark Crumpacker, the Chief Marketing Officer of burrito chain Chipotle, reveals some surprising findings about its customers' food choices. While Chipotle has sought to identify its brand closely with a commitment to using ingredients like Niman Ranch meats that are naturally-raised (the chain's motto, after all, is \"food with integrity\"), a recent \"ethnography study\" by Chipotle of its customers found that its emphasis on quality foods was not a major factor for its customers. \"We found that people are coming to Chipotle because they love the food, which is great,\" Crumpacker told Brandweek. \"But we found that they are not using the fact that we spend a lot of time and effort on making all of our food as sustainably and naturally-raised as possible. We all assumed that that was a big driving factor. Even people who were coming to Chipotle for a long time, they appreciate it, but it’s not the reason they are coming in. They just love the way the food tastes. That was a little bit of a surprise to us.\" You have to wonder about the impact of any messaging about organic/natural/sustainable ingredients on consumer food choices when such strong, mass-marketed branding like Chipotle's is found to have such little influence. At least when it comes to burritos.

This is not surprising.

As another mass market quality brand says, \"food should taste good.\"

As a marketer of locally grown foods for 9 years, I found that the assumptions that existed in the campaign planner's minds prior to launch (people want SUSTAINABLE local food) were quickly dispelled by some  basic market research.

The challenge in planning a marketing campaign of any kind is that you think your beliefs are generalizable to the broader community. But more often than not, your beliefs and those of your colleagues and associates are like the skin on an apple. Apparently everywhere,  but dwarfed by the true majority.

People want food to taste good first. They they want it to be from their community, and to support community economic development and self reliance. Organic eventually showed up on our surveys in 5th place.

This study shows more about the myopia of Chipotle grill than anything else.
Alison
2009-02-21 11:08:57
You could turn this on its head and say Chipotle is succeeding with quality foods--if you consider quality=tasty food. Busy customers may not take the time to evaluate Chipotle's green practices, but they do know they can get an affordable good lunch.

Although Chipotle's customers may overlook the company's commitment to sustainable food, Chipotle's growth still demonstrates that fast food can be achieved sustainably. And that's a good thing. I think this is something the industry, rather than consumers, takes note of.

I would argue that Chipotle tastes as good as it does BECAUSE it is \"food with integrity\". Quality ingredients mean a better eating experience. And I mean flavor, and digestion.

I beg to disagree. It matters to me that they use good ingredients, and that's why it tastes good. This is like the chicken and egg issue: there's no way to separate both things; and I hope Chipotle is not using this \"data\" as an excuse to slack. That would drive me away as I've been driven away from countless places.

People that say organic doesn't matter to the consumer may be missing the point. Organic costs more and not everyone can afford it. Perhaps that's the reason their \"surveys\" turn out to put this as a last factor. Most consumers have been brainwashed to the extreme into not minding what goes on their food as it's being produced.

Good, nutritious, sustainable and humane food sources DO MATTER.

Bravo has announced the panel of judges for its upcoming \"Top Chef\" spinoff, \"Top Chef Masters.\" Saveur editor James Oseland (above right), former New York magazine restaurant critic Gael Greene (center), and British food critic Jay Rayner (left) will serve as the judges. Kelly Choi, of of NYC TV's restaurant show \"Eat Out NY,\" will be the host. The reality series will feature a competition between 24 established chefs for the title of \"Top Chef Master\" and a prize for the charity of their choosing. More details from the press release: \"As previously announced and on the heels of the highest rated season yet for the Emmy and James Beard Award-winning No. 1 food show on cable, \"Top Chef,\" comes the spin-off \"Top Chef Masters,\" produced by the Magical Elves with consulting producer Tom Colicchio. Food journalist Kelly Choi will serve as the series' host, and renowned restaurant critic Gael Greene, culinary expert James Oseland and food critic Jay Rayner will serve as judges. The show will feature 24 world-renowned chefs competing against each other in a series of weekly challenges, as only one chef will make it to the finals to compete for the title of \"Top Chef Master\" and a prize for the charity of their choice. \"Top Chef lovers rejoice, Bravo and the Magical Elves are teaming up again to bring more of what our fans love most, fabulous food and tasty competition – and this time we're adding world-renowned chefs competing against each other to the menu,\" said Frances Berwick, Executive Vice President and General Manager, Bravo Media. Kelly Choi, food journalist and creator, producer and host of NYC TV's weekly restaurant show \"Eat Out NY,\" will host this highly competitive spin-off uniting some of the brightest stars in the world of food, showcasing the often cutthroat world of the culinary arts. A former model, Choi recently finished her book called \"The 20 Most Delicious Dishes in New York,\" which is set to hit stores in spring of 2009. Joining the judges' panel is Gael Greene, New York Magazine's famed restaurant critic for over 40 years, a best-selling author and co-founder of Citymeals-on-Wheels, which provides food to the homebound elderly. Along with Green is James Oseland, culinary expert and Editor-in-Chief of Saveur magazine, and British journalist, writer and broadcaster Jay Rayner, who will also serve as regular judges for the series. Each episode of \"Top Chef Masters\" holds two challenges for the chefs. The first is a twist on the classic quickfire challenge which tests their basic abilities and the second is a more involved elimination challenge designed to test the versatility and invention of the chefs as they take on unique culinary trials such as working with unusual and exotic foods or catering for a range of demanding clients. The food will be tasted and evaluated by the judges and a wide range of tasters for whom the challenge is aimed, whether it is patrons at a five-star restaurant or a room full of hungry kids – the food has to appeal to the diner as well as the critics if the chef is to survive.\"

How many ways can you re-engineer a towel? From the minds behind the somewhat Elmo-esque Grab&Dry dish drying gloves comes the Zip&Dry, which mashes up an apron and a terry cloth dishtowel. Instead of wiping your hands all over your apron, the idea is to use the removable towel, which can be zipped off and washed separately. Available in blue, gray, and green (with contrasting towel) for $39.95 at Just Perfect.

Did anyone bother to the hand model she is about to cut her fingers off when she is wiping them with the towel? I thought the good news of this product was a towel with cut resistive properties based on the way she is holding the knife. I guess I was wrong.

the site shows the model drying her hands, then produce, then the knife on the towel... gee... how sanitary is that? besides, the towel part keeps grazing the counter cabinets...

at $39.95 a piece, and i can get good, quick-dry kitchen towels at a quarter a piece retail. cheaper if i buy them by 10's.

Foes of Foie Gras Challenge How It's Advertised
***AUTHOR
Josh Friedland
***DATE
2009-01-27 00:00:00
***CONTENT
The latest salvo in the foie gras wars comes not from a court room, city council meeting, or state legislature, but from an advertising industry forum that reviews disputes over truth and accuracy in advertising. The National Advertising Division (NAD) of the Council of Better Business Bureaus announced in a press release issued yesterday that it has recommended that D’Artagnan Inc. discontinue certain advertising claims made for its foie gras products. As part of the advertising industry's \"self-regulation\" program, the NAD considers cases involving disputes over truth and accuracy in national advertising. While the complaints are typically made by an advertiser's competitors, in this case the challenge came from an organization, the Humane Society of the United States (HSUS), which has been pursuing a vigorous, multi-faceted campaign against foie gras production. NAD reviewed D'Artagnan's \"Internet advertising\" (essentially, the D'Artagnan website) following a challenge made by HSUS over two \"express claims\" about its foie gras: (1) \"The liver is not diseased, simply enlarged,\" and (2) \"Animals are hand-raised with tender care under the strictest of animal care standards.\" The Humane Society argued that these claims implied a series of messages it deems false, namely that artisan duck foie gras is \"not produced by force feeding, \"produced by healthy animals,\" and\"produced humanely.\" Following a review of evidence submitted by both sides, NAD concluded that D'Artagnan had not adequately substantiated the first claim about the health of the duck liver. It also found that the second claim about how the ducks are cared for \"suggests a level of care and oversight that is not supported by the evidence provided by the advertiser and is inconsistent with the evidence in the record.\" In response to the NAD recommendation to disband the two claims, D’Artagnan indicated that it \"strongly disagrees with NAD’s decision but nonetheless will comply and modify its advertising.\" A visit to the website shows that D'Artagnan has replaced the disputed language. The statement that \"The liver is not diseased, simply enlarged,\" which appeared in a backgrounder on foie gras, now reads \"According to published research * (partially funded by animal welfare agencies), the liver is enlarged but not diseased\" (two sources are cited in a footnote). The reference \"Animals are hand-raised with tender care under the strictest of animal care standards,\" which appeared in a product description for Sonoma Valley Ready-to-Cook Artisan Duck Foie Gras Lobe, now reads \"The ducks are hand-raised with tender care, surpassing governmental requirements.\" When reached for comment, Lily Hodge, Director of Public Relations at D'Artagnan, said that the company considered appealing the NAD recommendation, but determined that pursuing such an action would be onerous: \"We don't have the lawyers, the time, and the budget to do that,\" she said. \"We don't have a battery of lawyers like they do.\"

Thanks for posting this story, but I am curious why there isn't a single link to The Humane Society's website regarding foie gras where there are three links to D'Artagnan. Perhaps you didn't have a chance to search for it. Here's the link for your reference: http://www.humanesociety.org/farm/camp/ffa/

Good point about linking to HSUS (I have updated the post with a link to the campaign page). The links to D'Artagnan are only there in order to point readers directly to the sources of the language disputed in the challenge.

As there are no governmental requirements for the care of food animals, I guess if the animals are alive at all they are \"surpassing governmental requirements.\"  Food animals are exempt from the federal Animal Welfare Act and all state animal cruelty laws.  They have no legal protections except during the slaughter process, and poultry are exempt even from that.  Fraudulent advertising!

Annals of Marketing: Inauguration Satiation

***CONTENT
The inauguration of Barack Obama is quickly taking shape as a monumental event: a record-breaking 2 million people are estimated to descend on Washington, DC, to witness the ceremony, MSNBC has announced it plans to carry a simulcast live in movie theaters across the nation, and the television broadcast could be one of the most-watched events ever on TV. Naturally, it has spawned a small industry of marketing gimmicks to exploit the surge of attention being directed at January 20th. And, according to a series of new promotions, it looks like the food industry is getting in on the act, too. For the fromage-loving politico, the venerable cheese monger Murray's Cheese has created a special package of American-made cheeses \"chosen just for this historical occasion!\" The GObama Spread ($60 for 4 to 8 guests) includes \"rich Meadow Creek Grayson hailing from DC-neighboring Virginia, mushroomy Constant Bliss (named for a Revolutionary War scout!), supple Tomme de Brebis from Hope Farm, and economically-sound (and delicious!) Sole Gran Queso. Mix it up with spicy Windy City Wasabeans and crunchy Urban Oven Crackers.\" Enjoy rich Meadow Creek Grayson hailing from DC-neighboring Virginia, mushroomy Constant Bliss (named for a Revolutionary War scout!), supple Tomme de Brebis from Hope Farm, and economically-sound (and delicious!) Sole Gran Queso. Mix it up with spicy Windy City Wasabeans and crunchy Urban Oven Crackers.\" Need something to drink with that? I recently received a press release from Grey Goose with recipes for three \"presidential cocktails\": the honey and citrus infused \"Inaugural Partini\" (\"garnish with star anise and relish with pride\"), \"Obama On My Mind, a blend of vodka, vermouth, and blood oranges (\"top with sparkling wine for a drink that's as promising as America's future,\" and \"Barack's Cooler,\" a blend of vodka and pomegranate juice (\"present with orange zest. Toast with zeal\"). If you plan to dine out on the big day, Savoy restaurant is featuring a menu of \"passed hors d'oeuvres that represent some of the greatest hits of Chicago food, prepared by Chef Ryan Tate (who hails from the Windy City): deep dish pizza, wieners with cucumber relish, and \"Second City\" smoked BBQ.\" Savoy's sister restaurant Back Forty will hold a dance party at Back Forty: \"Snacks will be served at a buffet table and passed by waiters, and a selection of cocktails and beers (including 'Hop Obama' Ale from Sixpoint Craft Ales) will be for sale at the cash bar.\" A portion of the proceeds will support the non-profit Brennan Center for Justice.

Is your New Year's resolution to eat more fruit and vegetables in 2009? The Apple a Day poster provides a way for you to track your progress (and finally find a use for those annoying little labels stuck to your fruit). Just peel the stickers from your each of your fuji and affix them to the numbered squares for some preschool-style positive reinforcement. The 18\" x 23\" letterpress poster is $25 at VikDesign's Etsy Shop. [via swissmiss]

This is quite a nifty idea...I could use a visual/interactive reminder to get more fruit in my diet.

But, $20+ dollars for a black and white poster seems a bit extreme. Maybe I should just make my own!

\"Tampopo\" Goes Hollywood: Brittany Murphy as \"The Ramen Girl\"
***AUTHOR
Josh Friedland
***DATE
2009-01-06 00:00:00
***CONTENT
According to Serious Eats, Juzo Itami's brilliant 1985 cult comedy \"Tampopo\" is being reimagined as a new film starring Brittany Murphy as a young American woman in Japan who gets dumped by her boyfriend, only to get her groove back behind the counter of a noodle shop. As Serious Eats notes, it \"looks like 'Tampopo' meets 'Lost in Translation.'\" If you've never seen the original Tampopo -- a \"noodle Western\" interspersed with a series of satirical vignettes about food culture -- this might sound like a bizzarro \"Saturday Night Live\" skit (or just a bad dream). But, it's apparently for real, as this trailer for the film will attest: Media8entertainment provides a synopsis of the forthcoming \"The Ramen Girl\": \"Abruptly abandoned by her boyfriend, a young American woman (Murphy) finds herself suddenly alone and adrift in Tokyo. Lost in the shuffle of a foreign culture, and seeking to console herself, Abby winds up hanging out in her neighborhood ramen shop. After observing the magical effects of the shop's ramen on the customers, Abby convinces herself that her true path in life is to become a ramen chef. Abby persuades the shop's tyrannical, temperamental Japanese master chef to teach her the art of making ramen. And although their relationship is contentious and rocky, they both discover the most important ingredient of all - that each ramen bowl must contain a universe of feeling and truly be a gift from the heart.\" For a taste of the original, here's a memorable clip where the noodle master instructs the proper way to consume (and appreciate) the perfect bowl of ramen:

Tampopo is one of my favorite films (I own a copy and it sits on my kitchen shelf). I can't imagine it being ANY better than the original, but I will definitely have to see \"Ramen Girl\". Thanks for the heads up!

Not only is it stupid to remake a film like this -- it'll be even worse than the remake of \"Shall We Dance?\" -- but the article writer doesn't even seem to understand the film either. Didn't he or she notice that \"the noodle master\" character is a fiction, from a silly book read by the cowboy's sidekick, which starts the whole ball rolling because both he and the cowboy think the book is stupid? Let's just hope that Hollywood reviewers actually see the original before they make comparisons.

I can't believe they are doing a remake with Brittany Murphy. That doesn't sound right. I love the original Tampopo and always apologize to my pork after moving it aside :) I have very low expectations for the new version - but I'll probably see it anyway. Thanks for the tip Josh!

Generally, I, too, have been let down by American re-makes of great flicks (witness \"No Reservations\" up against the original \"Mostly Martha\", as well as \"Shall we Dance?\" mentioned by Thom), so I'm not likely to watch this.

The ONLY smidgeon of hope I hold is the potential that this new movie will be as good to \"Tampopo\" as \"Tortilla Soup\" was to \"Eat Drink Man Woman\" - the Sunday meals were the STARS of that remake!  Actually, I thought of \"Tortilla Soup\" as the emotional inside-out version of the original - nobody held back anywhere.

How sad.   It's like the \"Karate Kid\" meets \"Tampopo\" without the best of either.  It's like \"Lost in Translation\" only in the respect that both involve confused blondes in Japan.

Hopefully it won't be the like the pitiful remake of Mostly Martha, I'll forget the name for now with Catherine Zeta Jones..

Funny - I've been showing that Tampopo clip above in my cooking classes for the past two years at www.tastedc.com events...somebody is paying attention!

Thanks for this great post.  How did I not know about this remake???

I actually just blogged on this movie and other food-related media in December, should you be interested.

I agree with other comments about Brittany Murphy. Oh well, that's Hollywood for ya.

Hopefully the remake will shine a light on the original.  It is amazing to me how many people have never heard of Tampopo.  It is my all-time favorite film.

Cheers,

Genes, Geography, and Taste

***CONTENT
A recent study into the genetics of taste provides new insights into global variation in the sensitivity of humans to different flavors. Surveying residents of Kenya and Cameroon, the researchers discovered that these African populations were more sensitive to bitter tastes than Europeans. The Kenyans and Cameroonians were observed to have a very high level of diversity in a gene called TAS2R38, which detects bitter flavors, and they were able to sense more subtle ranges when given a bitter-tasting compound to taste. Scientists don't yet understand the reason for the difference between peoples from the two continents, but speculate that it may be linked to an evolutionary benefit that gave Africans the sensitivity to identify plants and vegetables that were beneficial to eat (but also bitter). So, why did Europeans lose this advanced sense of taste? One theory suggests it was due to the lack of genetic variation in those small numbers of Africans migrants who would became Europe's ancestors.

Wine Gift Bags Aren't Just Cheesy, They're Criminal

You know those slim, often cheesily decorated wine gift bags which are ubiquitous in wine shops? Well, a liquor shop in Rochester, New York, has been fined $10,000 by the New York State Liquor Authority for selling the bags. Apparently, according to New York state law, selling gift bags in a liquor store constitutes running a second business, which can be penalized with a hefty fine. The owner of the store says that he expects to lose as much as $20,000 in gift bag sales during this holiday season.

How ridiculous is this? FGS...go after criminals! I cannot believe, bureaucracy at it's finest here. I'm for the wine merchant. It might be 'cheesy', but I've NEVER had anyone object to receiving a nice bottle of wine in a gift bag before. In fact, I don't think it's cheesy at all. If someone gives ME wine, I appreciate the fact it isn't delivered in a 'brown paper bag', which hints at illicitness to me.

Your gift bag story reminded me of the best gift I received recently; a food tour of Chicago!  We know Gastronomes are for Obama, so we know Chi-town has great food.  If you like wine, cheese, and everything else specialty food wise, I'm a huge advocate now of sending people on chicago tours of food, or in any city that has a food tour.  They are the best way to learn the area, the history, architecture, and of course learn about all the local foods.  We tried the Near North Food Tour.  We found them at http://www.chicagofoodplanet.com and hope this helps readers who are looking for great gift ideas in any city that has a food tasting tour!

Going \"Trayless\" to Cut Food Costs, Waste
***AUTHOR
Josh Friedland
***DATE
2008-12-22 00:00:00
***CONTENT
As a measure to cut food costs and reduce the amount of wasted food, the trade magazine Restaurants & Institutions reports that many college and university dining programs are \"going trayless.\" Foodservice managers have found that when trays are eliminated from all-you-can-eat cafeterias, students take less food. As a result, less food also goes uneaten and ends up in the trash. Additional environmental benefits come from eliminating the need to wash the trays, resulting in less use of detergents and savings in energy and water. The solution makes sense in the same way that Dr. Brian Wansink has shown how the size of a plate can influence portion size and how much a person eats. It begs the question as to whether going trayless may not only eliminate waste, but also lead students to cut back on their calorie intake. Could traylessness even spell the end of the dreaded \"freshman 15\"? Aramark Higher Education, a provider of dining services to colleges and universities, claims that those schools which have removed their trays have seen a 25% to 30% drop in food waste per person. The company estimates that half of its 500 campus partners will be trayless by spring 2009.

You're on to something with the idea that going tray-less = eating less food. 

I remember my college days... filling up the tray with a bowl of this and a plate of that, just because the tray provided a way of carrying it ALL back to my table in one easy swoop. Yep - not too surprisingly, I gained the Freshman-15 and contributed a few more dishes to the dishwasher than were really necessary. 

The think the idea of going trayless is wonderful! It decreases food waste, encourages conscious eating (Am I full? Do I really want another ice cream sundae?), and exchanges a bit of the fast food cafeteria like feeling for a more cozy, family-style atmosphere... simply by getting rid of the ugly pastel colored trays.

Actor Jeremy Piven to Enter Sushi Rehab

***CONTENT
I never thought there would be an intersection between my \"Entourage\"-watching habit and matters of the gullet, but actor Jeremy Piven (who plays Hollywood agent Ari Gold on the show) is apparently a victim of eating too much sushi. As was widely reported yesterday, Piven has withdrawn from his role in the Broadway play \"Speed-the-Plow\" after discovering unusually high levels of mercury in his bloodstream. The diagnosis was made after he complained of fatigue, dizzy spells, and failing to remember his lines. According to his physician, Dr. Carlon Colker, Piven's mercury levels were roughly six times what the body can handle. His diet is blamed for the mercury poisioning. \"He was eating sushi twice a day and taking some Chinese herbs,\" Dr. Colker told E! News. \"I tested his heavy metals and his mercury was amazingly, shockingly high.\" According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), exposure to mercury \"may result in severe damage to the nervous and reproductive systems and may ultimately be fatal. Common symptoms of mercury poisoning are poor coordination and altered sensory perception. Pregnant women and children are especially vulnerable to mercury exposure. The most common cause of mercury poisoning in the United States is the consumption of fish contaminated with methylmercury.\" This is not to say that everyone agreees that mercury poisoning can be attributed to fish. The National Fisheries Institute (NFI), a fishing industry trade association, denies the link entirely. In a letter to the New York Times disputing a January 24, 2008 article on sushi and mercury, Mary Anne Hansan, Vice President, NFI, wrote, \"You say that you don’t know whether it’s true that not a single American has ever been clinically found to have mercury toxicity from fish consumption. I’d say that before you run a front-page story on the topic, that ought to be one of the first facts you should nail down. It’s easily confirmed by federal agencies and major medical organizations and the answer is this: zero.\" The FDA and EPA advisory on fish consumption mainly targets women who may become pregnant, pregnant women, nursing mothers, and young children. It recommends limiting consumption to 12 ounces (2 average meals) a week of fish lower in mercury. Let's say Piven had two six-ounce portions of tuna sushi five days per per week, he would have exceeded the FDA advisory in just one day. According to a the Natural Resources Defense Council's mercury calculator, the mercury intake for a 5' 10\" (this is disputed, but we'll give him the benefit of the doubt) white male of average weight (170 pounds for a 43-year old this size) consuming 12 ounces of Bigeye and Yellowtail Tuna per day would average an intake of 1.69 micograms per day, more than 15 times the EPA recommendations. Interestingly, Piven's bout with mercury poisoning has occurred just as the FDA indicates it may be reconsidering it's original advisory limiting seafood consumption. There's going to be a huge debate over any attempt to reverse current policy, and one wonders if such a public case might be influential. What's next for Piven? Playwright David Mamet told Daily Variety, \"My understanding is that he is leaving show business to pursue a career as a thermometer.\"

Too bad Jeremy didn't know about sustainable sushi - the top of food chain predators that are heaviest in mercury - are also the ones we should be avoiding. Had he made some new, sustainable choices, instead of endangered tuna, he might not be watching his understudy from a hospital bed. 

And anyone who's taking Chinese herbs these days, I'd say one word: melamine. Just who do you think is inspecting or ensuring your food is safe?

Speedy recovery Jeremy.

So, how bad is the economy? The latest indicator may be the plummeting sales of Champagne. While Champagne shipments increased by an average of 2.2% per year for the past two decades (and America’s consumption rose by 3.5% annually for the past five years), they are now plunging, down 10% from one year ago. One of the worst to be hit is Laurent Perrier, whose sales were 30% lower in the third quarter of 2008 than in the same period last year.

I'm sorry, that WASN'T my last comment. I spoke in haste, as the first page I clicked on must have been the worst of the bunch. I went back, and found some really great boxes. I registered to bid, I know the ones I like and will check towards the end to see where the bids stand. Of course, the ones I like the very best are already out of my price range, but I am hoping the others stay within a reasonable price range. Some of these are well worth looking at.

Grading Supermarkets on Seafood Sustainability

***CONTENT
Greenpeace released new rankings today for its \"seafood sustainability scorecard,\" first introduced in June 2008, which grades 20 national and regional U.S. supermarket chains on the environmental impact of their seafood purchasing and sales practices and policies. The new scorecard gives a \"passing\" grade to four supermarket chains -- Whole Foods, Ahold USA, Target, and Harris Teeter -- for scoring more than 40% on Greenpeace's scale (all 20 chains were given a failing grade last June). Trader Joe's was ranked the lowest (#17) of all of the national supermarket chains surveyed. The stores were evaluated on their development and implementation of sustainable seafood policies and practices, transparency and labeling, and the number of species for sale on Greenpeace's \"red list\" (which includes fish such as orange roughy, swordfish, and Chilean sea bass). \"While many supermarkets seek to green their image, the bottom line is that they are contributing to the crisis facing our oceans,\" said Greenpeace’s Oceans Campaign Director John Hocevar in a press release. \"The initial steps being taken to implement sustainability policies and practices are the right ones, but bigger strides are needed to prevent the collapse of our marine ecosystems.\"

This is not surprising but disturbing just the same. We can still help each other learn how to make better choices. My annual blog event called Teach a Man to Fish included top chefs, food writers, home cooks. 

Everyone shared recipes, tips and I compiled a resource list - I invite your readers to join next year and to use our collected wisdom to make better choices for themselves and the planet. http://tinyurl.com/6alsfr

For the first time, Greenpeace also included a Green Seafood Grocers section. These retailers actively engage with the NGO community through partnership with FishWise, a nonprofit seafood consultancy. According to the Greenpeace methodology, these companies are the \"greenest\" purveyors of seafood. By using the look up by state feature, you may find a FishWise member retailer near you!

We've been a little light on posting this week while spending the past week in California (Thanksgiving in the Bay Area followed by a few days in Los Angeles). On Sunday, my brother-in-law took us to the farmers market in Mar Vista, where I sampled some of the hugest and sweetest raspberries I've ever tasted. In the blaring sun -- with the temperature reaching the high 70s -- and seeing so much vibrant produce, you would swear it was still summer. Here are a few more photos below

\"Top Chef\" Fact Check: Are Spherical Olives New American?
***AUTHOR

***DATE
2008-11-24 00:00:00
***CONTENT
You may have been surprised as I was when Fabio's dish of beef carpaccio with \"spherical\" olives was crowned the winner of last week's \"Top Chef\" elimination challenge. I was particularly puzzled at how the olives, created with a technique borrowed from avant garde chef Ferran Adria, could even meet the competition's basic requirement -- to prepare a lunch menu of \"New American\" dishes. Impeccably sourced California olives brined in small batches from an American artisanal purveyor, sure! But, a concoction of olive puree and alginate to form jelly-coated balls -- huh? I don't doubt that Fabio's dish was the best tasting of the competition. But, if this was New American cuisine, what does New American mean anyway? In the Oxford Companion to American Food and Drink, Cathy Kaufman notes the movement emerged more than two decades ago, when chefs such as Larry Forgione, Michael Romano, and Michael McCarty, \"applied nouvelle cuisine's central tenets of impeccable ingredients, creatively manipulated, to existing American culinary traditions.\" One also thinks of Alfred Portale, Jonathan Waxman, and Judy Rodgers. In The Food Snob's Dictionary, David Kamp's guide to the world of gastronomy, he defines New American cuisine as an \"ambiguous label used to describe cuisine prepared by American chefs who cook with indigenous ingredients but don't hew to French-based kitchen orthodoxies.\" I emailed Kamp to elaborate and comment on the New American-ness of Fabio's spherical olives:\"'New American' is an inherently vague and slippery term, and has been since it came into currency in the early 1980s. In my romantic mind, the term should evoke some rustic bit of culinary Americana given a modern twist, e.g., roasted Hudson Valley capon with porchetta-style herb stuffing and, oh, a goat-cheese timbale on the side--the gastronomic equivalent of the Band's rockified old-tymey songs on 'Music From Big Pink.'\" \"But not everyone thinks this way,\" Kamp writes \"Wolfgang Puck has said that the pizzas he created at Spago in 1983 were quintessentially New American: Italian pies as reinterpreted by a French-trained Austrian immigrant who canvassed L.A.'s Jewish delis and Japanese fish markets. So, in that light, it's not necessarily a stretch for the 'Top Chef' guy to pass off his yolky, moleculista olives and Italianate carpaccio as New American.\" Previously:\"Top Chef\" Fact Check: Is a Vinaigrette an Emulsion?

Turkey Technique: The Dry Brine
***AUTHOR
Josh Friedland
***DATE
2008-11-19 00:00:00
***CONTENT
In the Los Angeles Times, Russ Parsons shares a turkey cooking technique inspired by Judy Rodgers, the chef/owner of San Francisco's Zuni Cafe. He calls it \"dry-brining\": \"You just salt the turkey a few days in advance, give it a brisk massage every so often to redistribute the salt, and then roast it.\" The salt releases moisture from the turkey, which gets reabsorbed by the meat, essentially brining the bird in its own juices. While wet-brining -- soaking the turkey in a saltwater solution -- has become a very popular way of preparing turkey, Parsons notes the technique often leads to a spongy texture. On the other hand, dry-brining leaves the turkey \"firm and meaty.\" While the technique is straightforward, make sure you leave enough time for the turkey to brine (three days), though Parsons writes that you can cut it back to two days.

I'm planning to try the dry-brining technique this year. I've heard so many good things! I'd been a little concerned about buying a fresh turkey so far in advance but when I called my butcher they said as long as it stays in the fridge it should be fine.

Btw, I found your blog through your wife. She'd suggested I check it out and I'm very glad I did!

Anyone know if the same amount of time should be used for just the breast?  I'm guessing the two days would be enough; I'm definitely trying this this year. I've always wondered if the wet-brining..in addition to that weird texture.. also makes it more difficult to dry the skin enough to get it crisp.  At least it seems to for me, unless I'm just not patient enough.  And a breast isn't in the oven long enough to get a really nice crisp skin if it is even a little wet. This sounds like the answer.

i'm guessing that if you vacuum-sealed the dry-brined turkey(is there a bag big enough?), the process would be quicker. try adding other flavorings(orange, herbs, spices), in addition to salt.

\"Top Chef\" Fact Check: Is a Vinaigrette an Emulsion?
***AUTHOR
Josh Friedland
***DATE
2008-11-17 00:00:00
***CONTENT
If you tuned into the premiere episode of season five of \"Top Chef\" last week, you may have witnessed a moment that seemed to capture the (entertaining) absurdity of turning cuisine into fodder for a reality show: A curious argument broke out between Stefan, the smug, Finnish-born, German-raised caterer, and Danny, the Long Island-based chef and resident New Yawker, over whether or not a vinaigrette is an emulsion. The conversation went something like this: STEFAN: A vinaigrette is a vinaigrette. DANNY: It's an emulsion. The technique of making vinaigrette is an emulsion. STEFAN: A vinaigrette is not an emulsion. DANNY: Emulsion! STEFAN: Come on! Get a life! So, is a vinaigrette an emulsion? Seeking a definitive answer to this critical question, I lugged out my copy of Alan Davidson's Oxford Companion to Food and looked up vinaigrette, which was defined as \"a 'mixture' (inverted commas because oil and vinegar are, strictly speaking, immiscible) of olive or other oil with vinegar (or lemon juice or the like or a combination of some vinegar and some lemon juice).\" This put me in the mood for a salad, but there was no mention of the word \"emulsion,\" so it didn't solve our conundrum. I consulted writer Harold McGee, who is esteemed as an authority on the science of food and cooking. He emailed me this simple and succinct solution to the vinaigrette puzzle: \"An emulsion is a combination of two liquids that can't mix evenly with each other, typically water and oil. One liquid is dispersed into the other in the form of separate droplets,\" He wrote. \"A vinaigrette is a suspension of vinegar droplets in oil, so yes, it's an emulsion.\" Case closed. Now, perhaps Stefan was thinking narrowly only of those emulsions that contain emulsifiers to stay together. As anyone who has made a basic vinaigrette knows, oil and vinegar will eventually separate into their original components (without more whisking). On the other hand, an emulsion like mayonnaise, which combines oil, lemon juice, and egg yolks, doesn't break down because of the presence of lecithin, an emulsifier, in the yolks. Similarly, adding some mustard to a vinaigrette will help to slow the separation of the oil and vinegar. So, Stefan was wrong. A vinaigrette is an emulsion. Images: Eater, flickr user DanielCK.

Well, to be -really- pedantic, a vinaigrette is only an emulsion if it's an emulsified vinaigrette. Sometimes vinaigrettes are \"broken\", which might be because a lot of time has passed since whisking, because the dressing hasn't been whisked properly, or because the cook has made a conscious decision to use a separated vinaigrette. Emulsified vinaigrettes are creamy and consistent in texture, broken ones have distinct oil and vinegar components.

Looking back from culinary school, we had many different emulsions that we made in class. One being a temporary i.e a vinegarette, short term, i.e. hollandaise and a more permenant, i.e. a mayonaise.

If I remember correctly from my culinary education, a suspension is different from an emulsion...
Michael
2008-11-18 12:11:37
I would have to say the difference is in the semantics. emulsion is a technical term meaning an emulsion which is a suspension of two liquids which cannot be combined and a vinaigrette which is a sauce/dressing which is made from 3 parts oil and 1 part vinegar traditionally. The former being preparational and the latter being constituential.  The guy on the show was an ass and trying as I am to sound smart ;)...

A vinaigrette that doesn't contain eggs, mustard or another ingredient to stabilize the mechanical emulsion is called an \"unstable\" emulsion.\" Mayonnaise, hollandaise etc are \"stable emulsions.\"

Ha! As I sat in front of my fireplace watching this episode I recalled fondly my days in the \"front of the house\" listening to the bickering of the chefs in the back. Whether a vinaigrette is a vinaigrette or a vinaigrette is an emulsion matter not - chefs will always find something to argue about. Because, like most creative directors (which I am in the field of advertising) it's rarely about the content and always about the battle.

EU Relaxes Rules on Imperfect Produce

***CONTENT
The EU has scrapped strict standards on the size and shape for 26 fruits and vegetables, paving the way for the sale of funny looking fruits and vegetables. The decision came despite protests from some nations which wanted to keep the rules for fear that produce prices would drop significantly. \"This is a happy day indeed for the curvy cucumber and the knobbly carrot, and other amusingly shaped fruits and vegetables,\" said European Commission spokesman Michael Mann. \"It's a concrete example of our drive to cut unnecessary red tape,\" added EU Agriculture Commissioner Mariann Fischer Boel. \"We simply don't need to regulate this sort of thing at EU level.\" She also noted that in a climate of high food prices and economic crises, \"consumers should be able to choose from the widest range of products possible. It makes no sense to throw perfectly good products away, just because they are the 'wrong' shape.\" Rules will be eliminated for apricots, artichokes, asparagus, aubergines, avocados, beans, Brussels sprouts, carrots, cauliflowers, cherries, courgettes, cucumbers, cultivated mushrooms, garlic, hazelnuts in shell, headed cabbage, leeks, melons, onions, peas, plums, ribbed celery, spinach, walnuts in shell, water melons, and chicory. However, as a compromise, standards remain in place for apples, citrus fruit, kiwi fruit, lettuces, peaches and nectarines, pears, strawberries, sweet peppers, table grapes and tomatoes.

The Brie Cheese Effect

***CONTENT
To explain the growth of the Himalayan mountains tens of millions of years ago, geologists turn to an unlikely analogy: oozing brie cheese. If the thick, firm mold on a wheel of brie represents the rocky surface of the high Tibetan Plateau, deep below the rock is more like soft cheese, capable of flowing under pressure or when heated (by the Earth's interior). \"It's like you put that into your microwave and turned it up just a bit,\" geologist Kip Hodges explained to National Geographic. \"It doesn't melt, but it begins to flow.\" The softer rock slowly oozes through the crust and onto the surface, adding new layers, and therefore new height, to the mountains.

Bioengineering students at Rice University are experimenting in making beer more like wine -- or, at least, channeling red wine's healthful properties into something sudsier. The objective is to take the yeast used to ferment beer and genetically engineer it to produce resveratrol, the compound in red wine that is believed to be beneficial for cardiac health and fighting cancer. Why beer? As reported on NPR, the students' ultimate goal is to bring the health benefits of wine to a much larger audience (beer consumption greatly outstrips consumption of wine). In order to brew their \"Biobeer,\" the students are introducing two genes found in grapes into a yeast strain provided by the Saint Arnold Brewery in Houston, Texas. According to the research project's web site, fermentation experiments are still ongoing. And, if you're not interested in drinking beer or wine to improve your health, future work will explore genetic engineering of yeasts to make other resveratrol-infused liquors like cider, whiskey, bourbon, and vodka. Hic.

Its great to hear that research going on making beer more like wine and bringing health benefits of wine to beer. Once it is done, I think this will drasticaly increase the consumption of beer.

Spoons, Knives, and Forks That Float

***CONTENT
Shelterrific points to these innovative concepts for floating utensils: The ceramic forks, knives, and spoons are shaped with an empty ball in the center so that they will bob up and down rather than sinking to the bottom of your sink (and ending up in the garbage disposal). The gastronomic buoys might also make for an interesting way to serve food: I could imagine them floating in a container of just about anything brined or, perhaps, in a bowl of bocconcini chilled in water. The utensils' creator, Seongyong Lee, has also designed a plastic ladle that, like the forks and knives, floats upright. Both designs only appear to be concepts at this point, though a hypnotic video of the ladle in action is available on YouTube. Images: Seongyong Lee.

I know it was several weeks ago, but I see that you have a post related to your support for Obama.  Why are the comments closed for that post when you allow comments on other posts?  

If you want to somewhat alienate almost half of your readers (46% of the nation voted for McCain), then you should at least open it up for comments.  

Personally I read your blog for food information, but apparently you want to impart your political opinion as well (like so many celebrities).  I posted a similar comment on one of Adam Roberts' posts and it never made it through the moderation queue... interesting.  I wonder what my chances are of getting through here.

For Better Flavor, Lick Your Ice Cream

***CONTENT
Does ice cream taste better licked from a cone or eaten with a spoon? An expert in food technology at Massey University in New Zealand recently weighed in on this critical issue: \"Flavor in ice cream is only released when the fat content – which carries the flavor – is warmed in the mouth to at least body temperature,\" said Kay McMath. \"During licking, the tongue is coated with a thin layer of ice-cream which is more quickly warmed and the flavor is detected by the large surface area of the taste buds present on the tongue.\" In comparison, a spoon provides some insulation to keep the sample colder when the ice cream enters the mouth. Once inside, the tongue pushes the ice cream to the roof of the mouth to melt before swallowing. This results in a smaller surface area on the tongue involved in warming the ice cream and releasing flavor. No word yet on how biting into an ice cream cone, our preferred method, affects flavor

I heard about this concept recently...licking ice cream produces a better flavor...so I had to try it out! I agree. Having the ice cream warmed by your mouth does give the ice cream more of a full flavor - so if you're spooning the ice cream - you can just hold it in your mouth a little longer!!

Wine Bottles Go on a Diet

The Associated Press reports on a number of recent efforts by vintners to lighten their bottles in order to reduce shipping costs and lessen the environmental impact of wine distribution. California's Fetzer Vineyards, for example, is switching to a lighter-weight glass that makes bottles approximately 14 percent lighter -- a savings of 2,200 tons of glass annually. Most of the bottles lose the \"punt\" -- the indentation usually found on the bottom of a wine bottle. Despite the economic and environmental benefits of lighter packaging, there remains some resistance to the notion of leaving heavy bottles behind. \"If you've got a handmade boutique product, you have to have the right frame for it,\" winemaker John Bell tells the AP. \"Would you want to see a picture hanging on your wall with a cheap black, wood frame? Not if it's a Matisse.\"

We reported earlier on the oddities in Cascadian Farm's packaging design discovered by the bloggers at Bread & Honey. They found images of strange, tiny faces embedded in the tips of broccoli on boxes of Cascadian Farm broccoli florets. Here's a close-up, below. Well, it turns that there is even more to the story. Tipped off by one of their readers, the enterprising bloggers went back to the supermarket in search of more packaging quirks and found something very unusual on the labels of jars of Cascadian Farm concord grape jam. Looking very closely at the label's illustration of a pastoral farm setting, they saw that there were babies -- yes, babies -- in the hills! Below is a close up (and at top is an enlargement of one of the faces). When blogger Alicia Carrier contacted Small Planet Foods, the parent company of Cascadian Farm (owned by General Mills), she received this straightforward, yet puzzling, response claiming total awareness of the faces: \"The tradition of hiding names or faces on Cascadian Farm packaging began over a dozen years ago. It was unspoken tribute by the package design department to the friends & family of Cascadian Farm.\" Despite this homespun tradition at the company, Small Planet Foods promised that, \"The faces won’t be included on our redesigned packaging.\"

Coffee and Custard Polls Swing Towards Obama

***CONTENT
According to recent polls of registered voters, Senator Barack Obama appears to be solidifying an impressive lead over his rival, Senator John McCain. But, what about the coffee and custard vote? The results are still coming in, but there appears to be a strong turnout for Obama for patrons of 7-Eleven stores and the Culver's Custard ice cream chain. 7-Eleven's \"7-Election\" is tracking customers who chose a blue coffee cup for Obama vs. a red coffee cup for McCain. The latest results are a landslide for the Democrat: 60% for Obama and 40% for McCain. But, before Democrats get too giddy, bear in mind that the map (above) skews towards traditionally blue coastal states and leaves out much of the Mid-West and South. And while the numbers look very good for Obama, they most likely do not reflect one of Governor Sarah Palin's key consitituencies, \"Joe Sixpacks\" who would presumably be shopping at 7-Eleven for beer, not coffee. Culver's Custard has crowned \"Heath Toffeebits,\" the Democratic candidate, the winner of the \"popular vote\" in its \"Custard Election,\" with 51 percent of the 103,000 total votes cast online. In-store purcases of the two custards (so-called \"electoral college\") votes went to \"Reese E. Buttercup,\" the Republican sundae candidate, which out-sold the Democrat for a total of 53 percent of the 70,700 total votes. The map, detailing the distribution of online votes across (the heavily Mid-Western and Southern) states where Culver's operates, shows that the Democratic candidate made important inroads in battleground states Colorado and Michigan. Do these fake polls/publicity stunts tell us anything relevant about the real election? Probably not. But, then again, 7-Eleven customers did get the result right in 2000 and 2004.

Can you imagine the look on your child's face when she finds out that what looks like an ice cream cone is really Thomas Keller's signature cornet filled with raw salmon? Well, you may be able to redeem yourself this Halloween with Keller's bat-shaped sandwich cookies, recently featured at Savory Tidbits. The cookies are currently available for $3 each now through October 31 at Bouchon Bakery (Time Warner Center, Ten Columbus Circle, Third Floor). To make them yourself, just pick up some bat-shaped cookie cutters or other appropriately Halloween-themed shapes (the black cat and coffin would do nicely), and follow the recipe for Thomas Keller's \"TKO\" Oreo-style cookies.

The two food bloggers behind the cooking weblog Bread & Honey recently faced down a bag of frozen broccoli and discovered that the bag was staring back at them. Or, rather, tiny \"terrifying ecstatic faces\" were staring back, peering out from the images of broccoli florets on a bag of Cascadian Farms frozen broccoli. We hope that the minuscule green faces, which appear to grow right out of the tops of the broccoli, are just the work of a talented, but deranged photo editor.

In May, Dr Pepper challenged Guns N' Roses to release its famously delayed album \"Chinese Democracy\" during 2008. If the album was issued, the soda company promised it would give away a free can of Dr Pepper to \"everyone in America.\" Now that \"Chinese Democracy\" will officially be released at the end of November, Dr Pepper plans to make good on its bet with the rock band and give away soda by using coupons. It may turn out to be a brilliant marketing move, but it could cost Dr Pepper several million dollars, according to Ad Age, which put the total at $165 million in the extremely unlikely event that every American claimed his or her free can of soda.

On the heels of her PBS road trip through Spain with Mario Batali and Mark Bittman, Gwyneth Paltrow seems to be cementing her reputation as a gastrolebrity. Adopting the guise of a lifestyle guru, she is dispensing her thoughts on cooking (along with shopping, fashion, and other activities that \"nourish the inner aspect\") on her oddly-named new web venture, GOOP. So far, GOOP's main product is a weekly subscription-based email newsletter published in the mode of Daily Candy -- only here written in the first person and signed simply as \"Gwyneth.\" The first email dedicated to cooking shipped today, with healthy recipes for vegan pancakes (they look better than they sound), tuna sandwiches, soy/sesame mayonnaise, and caramelized black pepper chicken (courtesy of San Francisco's The Slanted Door). Overall, the food looks fine and the first-person instructions are straightforward, save for some chirpy aphorisms like \"Cook with love!\" and \"Make it Great!\" There's a plug for Jamie Oliver's cookware in the mix and this puzzling comment: \"[the chicken] is so easy and tastes like what you always imagine take-out will taste like (but sadly never does).\" And I always had such low expectations for take-out food.

Did you know that Anthony Bourdain has his own talk show? Apparently, it premiered earlier this week on the Travel Channel (if you saw it, let us know what you think). On the TV talk show scale, it appears to be less like Oprah and more like Charlie Rose, as \"Tony hosts a no-holds-barred dinner with four featured guests\" (the first episode included writer Bill Buford, nightlife impresario Amy Sacco, TV personality Ted Allen, and Maxim editor Chris Wilson. \"At the Table with Anthony Bourdain\" airs Mondays at 10 p.m. on the Travel Channel.

I saw it last night (I have all Anthony Bourdain stuff set to auto record) 

I'd say it's touching on something more like \"Dinner for Five with Jon Favreau\" http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0291604/

And actually I'd prefer if it were more like so, rather then having those brief moments where the guest is speaking post production. 

It is something that could work, if they could do a little more presentation on the local restaurant as well.

The usual anthony bourdain personnae is a lot more interesting than the show.   The topics were a little cliched and esoteric (is it wrong to spend $1800 on a meal?).  Also, in this particular episode, Amy Sacco came off as a boring idiot.
GL

It worked for me.  However, I thought it was just a one-time thing.  I'm not sure how this stretches topic-wise to cover multiple shows unless there is enough topic-of-the-moments to discuss.  Otherwise, Bourdain as personna carried the show.

Agree on Sacco, though.  Could have done without her.

5 burnt out ex and current drug users talking about food like they are saving the world?  Please.  Bourdain used to be a cook and brought dignity to the craft.  Now he is a clown.  He is taking the whole \"I used to do drugs, swear a lot, and look how edgy I am\" personae too far. He will be begging the food network for a gig because his decline has started.

Agreed.  I love Bourdain and No Reservations, but it was honestly hard for me to watch this show.  It embarrassingly bad, and, right, so cliche.  Painful.  Dinner For Five was way more spontaneous and real and interesting.  Just let them all get really drunk and speak the truth.  And sadly, I agree with the person who said that Bourdain's badboy act is a little tired.  It is.  He's more like a privileged nerd now.  So it didn't play well at all.

I liked Kitchen Confidential, his mystery books are fine for light reading, and No Reservations is sometimes pretty interesting.  But...

this show was surprisingly dull.  As one commenter noted, the conversation was very contrived and the guests didn't seem to have anything interesting to say.

Tony - be a chef and cook something, or ben an author and write something.  Leave the talk show bit to John Steward and Conan O'Brien.

A new report by Consumers International, a UK-based umbrella for consumer groups, has found that although cereal makers are reducing the amount of sugar in kids' cereals, they increase the amount of salt to improve flavor. According to Consumers International, \"manufacturers are likely to add salt to boost the flavor of the product, and may use salt to maintain customer appeal when sugar levels are reduced.\" In the study, a sampling of Kellogg's Frosties Reduced Sugar cereal was found to contain, on average, 1.5% salt, an amount that is larger than you would find in potato chips. Moreover, the reduced sugar cereal compared unfavorably to a sample of a full-sugar kids' cereal, Kellogg's Smacks, which averaged less than 1% salt.

Even the Obamas Deserve a Break

***CONTENT
Has there ever been more scrutiny of the eating habits of White House inhabitants than those of the Obamas? First, there was a call for a self-appointed \"kitchen cabinet.\" Then, the debate over naming a new White House chef, and, of course, the great kitchen garden kerfuffle.Now, Michelle Obama's remarks about cooking are being taken to task on the opinion pages of the New York Times. In an op-ed published on Sunday, Amanda Hesser writes of her disappointment with comments Obama made about, let's say, a lack of enthusiasm for cooking:[W]hen The Washington Post asked Mrs. Obama for her favorite recipe, she replied, “You know, cooking isn’t one of my huge things.” And last month, when a boy who was visiting the White House asked her if she liked to cook, she replied: “I don’t miss cooking. I’m just fine with other people cooking.” Though delivered lightheartedly, and by someone with a very busy schedule, the message was unmistakable: everyday cooking is a chore.Hesser says the statements are not just a letdown because she has been vocal about the importance of healthy, locally-grown ingredients, but because it represents a missed opportunity to bolster dwindling interest in cooking. Hesser's desire for a rebirth in the family kitchen for a nation increasingly detached from the experience of cooking real food from raw ingredients is admirable. And, perhaps things have become so bad that there is a place for government to encourage a return to cooking.However -- and this is a food blogger writing this -- I don't really find what Michelle Obama said so outrageous. First of all, as Eddie Gehman Kohan points out at obamafoodorama, her remarks may have been taken out of context. But, secondly, cooking can be a chore. I think that anyone employed full-time and with children will be aware that the demands of cooking from scratch -- the shopping, the cooking, and the cleaning -- cannot always be met on a limited schedule. And, I imagine Michelle Obama's plate is quite full, to boot. Moreover, it's not as if the Obamas are compromising the progressive views about food embodied in the White House Kitchen Garden. The garden is overseen by the White House kitchen, and the ingredients will used to prepare the family's dinners. It's not as if the organic vegetables are being tossed so in favor of heating up frozen dinners.I also wonder why so much responsibility is being laid at the feet of Michelle Obama? As a dude who cooks, I find it a little sexist to place the responsibility of promoting cooking solely at the feet of the first lady? Would anyone even think twice if the President had uttered his wife's words? Last week's image of Barack strolling across the White House lawn with paper bags full of take-out burgers was pretty much celebrated by the press and public. I hesitate to think of criticism Michelle would have come under were it she was carrying home takeout.Finally, to show how the scrutiny has really gotten out of hand, peruse Frank Bruni's critique of the \"predictability\" of the Obamas' choice of the restaurant Blue Hill for a night out in New York City this past weekend.I understand all of this is happening because expectations are so high for the first family, and that's a good thing. But, this is starting to go too far.Cooking is important. Americans' diets are in trouble. But, let's give the Obamas a break.

There’s a wonderful new book out called “The Power of Small” which was written by Kaplan Thaler and Robin Koval and it’s all about how small things can have a big impact. Obviously this is an extreme case, but this totally exemplifies this – no detail is too small as proven by the attention given to where and what Obama eats! On a personal note however, this book has been great because it made me more conscious about how small things can affect both my personal and professional life. Instead of feeling hopeless it’s best to be proactive and aware, both which this book allows you to do.

Josh, I enjoyed this post and agree with your point of view on the subject. While I don't agree that cooking is a chore, I do find Michelle Obama's honesty refreshing. It's that type of honesty that will endear her to people, and hopefully, make them more willing to listen to the important things she has to say on the topics that are her \"big things.\"

The idea of culinary travel usually conjures up a romanticized image like a trip to Alba to hunt for white truffles, a wine tour of the Rhone Valley, or perhaps the ultimate in foodish travels, a week in Tuscany cooking, eating, and discussing food and wine with Michael Pollan.But, a new promotion that recently arrived in my inbox suggests the innovation of an entirely new genre of gastronomic vacations: ice cream tourism. Apple Core Hotels is offering a \"Gelato Tour\" travel package from July 1 to August 31 which includes accommodations at one of the company's five New York City hotels (starting at $179 per night) and a $30 credit towards scoops from three gelato shops in the West Village-centric \"Gelato District\": Apple Core Hotels guests can take a relaxing stroll through the charming streets of New York City’s “Gelato District”, where their taste buds will be given a workout with the varied flavor offerings––from the traditional Stracciatella to the adventurous Ciocco Peperoncino (chocolate cayenne pepper). Guests will visit the following shops on the tour: Grom (an Italian gelati chain, serving a range of flavors made with first-rate ingredients from the old country), L'Arte Del Gelato (featuring Italian favorites such as Stracciatella, Cassata Siciliana and Biscotti), and Cones (be sure to try the Corn flavor with an optional sprinkle of cinnamon). All three shops are situated within walking distance of one another in the West Village neighborhood of Manhattan.I didn't even know that that New York had a \"Gelato District.\" But, if there is to be one, shouldn't Il Laboratorio del Gelato be chief among the landmarks?

Mark your calendars. The next \"World Testicle & Aphrodisiac Cooking Championship\" (ballcup.com) will be held on August 29-30, 2009, in Gornji Milanovac, Serbia.Officially titled \"Mud®ijada,\" the goal of the competition is \"promoting testicle specialities [sic] as well as Serbian traditional cuisine.\"The website offers this mission statement of sorts: \"The Scots have Scotch, the Swiss have cheese, and we Serbs have balls! Why shouldn’t we sell them to the world as a real Serbian trademark speciality from Shumadija?\"The event is the brainchild of Serbian chef Ljubomir R. Erovic, who, you may remember, is the author of The Testical Cookbook: Cooking With Balls. Something of a testicle evangelist, Erovic had a testicular epiphany when, \"sometime at the end of the ‘80s,\" he unwittingly devoured a delicious testicle goulash:\"I couldn’t sleep that very night because I became incredibly aroused and felt a real 'charge of positive energy' that I had to use somehow. I had never experienced anything like that before. The next day, after the wild night, I found out from a friend that the dish we ate was testicle goulash. I suddenly realized that it could be a great way to help the sexually troubled ones and through the cooking contests discover the strongest aphrodisiac to conquer the world. The way to better sexual life through food and not drugs is the idea that keeps running through my mind.\"Just as there is an Olympic Village at the Olympics, there will be a \"Balls Village\" at the Testicle Championship with \"music, drinks, and promotional activities for homemade aphrodisiacs and accessories for a healthy sex life (nuts, honey, whole nuts, peanuts and special herbs.\" Did I mention nuts?The website lists a series of strict \"rules\" for the championship: attendance by minors or people older then 65 (\"without medical approval\") is not allowed, bringing Viagra is forbidden, and, \"the 'casual' visit to the 'balling village' is prohibited.\"And, if the ladies out there were thinking about attending, the regulations note that \"Women are allowed everything.\"

Court Rules Against Pringles
***AUTHOR

***DATE
2009-05-26 00:00:00
***CONTENT
A UK Court of Appeal decided once and for all last week that Pringles are \"crisps\" (what the British call chips) and are subject to the 15% Value Added Tax (VAT). To be taxed, a snack product \"must be wholly, or substantially wholly, made from the potato.\"The ruling was a defeat for Proctor & Gamble, which owns the Pringles brand. Oddly enough, Proctor & Gamble's lawyers insisted that Pringles were not crisps, arguing that they are distinguished by their uniform color and shape \"not found in nature.\"That view was upheld in a trial last year in which a judge ruled that Pringles were not \"made from the potato\" (potatoes only make up 42% of Pringles' ingredients).But, the Court of Appeal judges overruled that decision, finding that Pringles had “more than enough potato content” to be considered crisps, and therefore would be taxable going forward.

Lifting the Veil on Industrial Food

***CONTENT
We're living in a \"lifting the veil\" moment.From getting a grip on how we arrived at this global financial crisis to revelations about the Bush administration's legal wrangling to allow waterboarding at Guantanamo Bay, not to mention calls for further investigations (and prosecutions), the veil is being lifted everywhere.There's a lot of talk about \"lifting the veil\" in the new documentary film Food Inc. Here, the filmmakers want to reveal to the audience how industrial food makes it from the farm to your table and show audiences the stark difference between the idealized images of farming on food packing and the serious problems of modern industrial food production, ranging from ethical issues in the treatment of animals to fair labor practices, food safety crises, and the increasing health problems due to change in diets towards carbohydrates influenced by the business of food. It's all a little depressing to watch. But, while the muckraking film clearly has an agenda for change, it's not overbearing. The tone is cool, not hot. With excellent cinematography and colorful graphics, the presentation is more Al Gore than Michael Moore. Sort of a gastronomic An Inconvient Truth if you will.If you are familiar with the work of authors Michael Pollan and Eric Schlosser (who both appear as talking heads in the movie), you may not learn much of anything particularly new. The film rehashes the (compelling) arguments these authors have made concerning how government policy has favored \"cheap food,\" driving the food industry toward producing the lowest common denominator in terms of nutrition, negative environmental impact, and health risk.But, to use a cliche, a picture does speak a thousand words, and so while it may be one thing to read about factory farming, it's another thing to see footage of Matrix-like chicken processing plants where thousands of fuzzy cute baby chickens are hatched and pulled from steel drawers and and sorted and stamped like mail through a system of conveyor belts and chutes. It's as marvelous as it is disturbing. And when the filmmakers are not allowed to see inside the houses where chickens are grown -- the curtains are pulled down to keep the daylight out -- what we don't see is even more haunting.Unfortunately, the film is terribly one-sided, but only because it seems that all of the corporations featured in the film -- Monsanto, Tyson, Smithfield, Perdue -- declined to be interviewed. They did this at their peril, at least cinematically, as they remain faceless while the filmmakers interview a range of sympathetic farmers who are severely restricted by the heavy influence of big agriculture. A particularly insightful segment deals with a farmer whose dwindling \"seed saving\" business is under attack from lawyers from Monsanto seeking to protect their patented seed strains. But, it's not all bad news. The film does get a bit of uplift and some humor from the farmer Joel Salatin, a charismatic iconoclast and true believer in traditional methods of raising livestock and working outside of the industrial system. His corporate counterpart is the yogurt giant Stoneyfield Farm, which has managed to carve out some success using organic practices. It's depicted as a model for making changes in the business of food. In a late rally, Pollan suggests, on a positive note, that however daunting it may seem, change is possible, comparing the challenge of transforming the food industry to the success of anti-smoking advocates in changing the tobacco industry.The film is very effective at weaving together a complicated message about ethics, health, and the environment, but I don't know whether audiences will be emboldened or just dejected and head back to the snack bar for the haze of a new veil made of salty popcorn with fake butter and high fructose corn syrup-spiked soda.

Zip Code win·ery (noun): A winery whose vineyards may be located in one place, but seeks to associate itself with another area.In her profile of wine business mogul Fred Franzia in the May 18, 2009 issue of the New Yorker, Dana Goodyear describes how Franzia's popular Charles Shaw wine (also known as \"Two Buck Chuck\") gains from the prestige associated with the Napa Valley wine region -- where it is bottled -- even though it is made from grapes grown in vineyards in California's less desirable Central Valley:Although Charles Shaw wine falls under the generic California appellation, the broadest possible desig­nation, it can legitimately be labelled “Cellared & Bottled by Charles Shaw Winery, Napa, CA,” a practice that strikes many in Napa as unsavory. “It’s called a Zip Code winery,” Vic Motto, a business adviser to Napa Valley wineries, says. “The unsuspecting consumer may not realize it’s not Napa wine. Fred uses that to his advantage.”

This seems similar to the old terminology of a \"mail drop address.\"
  
Maybe this is a Napa Valley localism?

Hooray for two buck chuck. Let the wine snobs have their $40 Malbec from Napa, us working folks appreciate good table wine at a great price regardless of it origin - Modesto, Chile, it's all good (no Texas wine, please).

hmm... if you had a regular set of measuring spoons... there is normally a 1/2 tbsp... adn that's 1 1/2 tsp, isn't it? 1/8 tsp is a feature in most measuring spoon sets i have, but he 2 tsp could come in handy. i rarely see 2/3 tsp in recipes though and a pinch is just a pinch. i love the handles though... but $15 is a tad expensive, especially with shipping.

Based on the relative success of last year's square foot gardening experiment, I've been at work on this year's sequel.The 2009 edition will be a beefed up version of last year. I added two more narrow boxes (our space is limited) primarily for salad greens, on either side of the two original boxes. I've also been planting thyme between the boxes as an edible groundcover.So, what's new for this year? More greens, as I noted above. I'm planning to devote four of the squares to salad greens: mesclun, a mix of Asian greens, arugula, and frisee. I've started these plants as seeds in trays and will be planting them shortly. In the interim, I thought I would try growing a bunch of spinach plants in their dedicated squares (it's supposed to mature quickly), and then plant out the salad seedlings once the spinach is harvested.I'm also growing broccoli rabe, fennel, peas, and garlic chives (all of which I did not try last year) along with heirloom tomatoes, cucumbers, radishes, carrots, and beets. The biggest question mark of all will be cantaloupe, which I am really doing mostly for fun -- after all, I'm only growing one plant. The vine will grow vertically on a trellis and apparently will require some kind of makeshift support crafted from pantyhose so the melons won't tear off and fall down off the vine. Should be interesting. Here's the contents of the garden at week 4, box by box (left to right):Box #1 (back to front): Peas, Spinach (mesclun later), Spinach (Asian greens to come later).Box #2 (back to front, row by row): cucumber, cucumber, cantaloupe; broccoli rabe; broccoli rabe; garlic chives; radishes, radishes, beets.Box #3 (back to front, row by row): Heirloom tomatoes -- \"Old German,\" \"Mr. Stripey,\" and \"Cherokee Purple\"; bush beans, swiss chard, fennel; basil, carrots, spinach.Box #4 (back to front): Pole beans, arugula, frisee.If you want to follow along, I'll be posting photos to flickr (here are photos from last year). And the flickr square foot gardening group is an excellent resource and source of inspiration.Finally, a question for all of the experienced vegetable gardners out their: to grow \"cut and come\" lettuce like mesclun picked as baby leaves, do you simply scatter the seeds (with abandon, ignoring spacing rules)? How many seeds are too many?

Josh- Very inspiring and cool.  I've done herbs and tomatoes on my small balcony in Brooklyn, this has me thinking I can do more next year, just go vertical!

I'm not a pro but my Mom is and from what I recall growing up we scattered the lettuce seeds evenly and not \"with abandon\". Can't give you a guide but my memory tells me it's exactly the same as seasoning a good roast liberally.  It's about the same coverage and dispersal.  No piles, no blank spots, a nice even layer.  I think the width was about 1 1/2\".  Will double check on the phone with her next chance I get. Good luck!

***CONTENT
ghost a·cres (noun): The amount of land needed by a nation to produce the equivalent amount of food it procures by trade and sea.Closely related to the concept of \"food miles,\" ghost acres was coined by scientist, geographer, and ecologist Georg Borgstrom in his 1965 book The Hungry Planet.Anthropologist John H. Bodley explained the meaning of the term in his 2007 book Anthropology and Contemporary Human Problems:In 1965, food scientist Georg Borgstrom introduced the concept of ghost acres, referring to the fact that trade and fishing were ways of gaining extraterritorial acres. Ghost acres were calculated as the amount of land a given country would need to put in production to gain an equivalent amount of animal protein equivalent to its net food imports and fishery production. Ghost acres have also been called \"phantom carrying capacity.\" According to this reckoning many nations had already far exceeded the carrying capacity of their farmlands -- at least given their culturally prescribed food patterns -- and had become precariously dependent on uncertain international markets and frail marine resources. At that time Borgstrom calculated that Japan's ghost acres exceeded its agricultural acreage by more than six times and the United Kingdom's effective acres were nearly tripled by ghost acres.\"\"The problem with subsisting on ghost acres,\" Bodley explained, \"is that global fisheries are now heavily over-exploited and in danger of collapse. By 2003, seven of the top-ten species, constituting 30 percent of global wild fisheries, were considerd to be fully exploited and in danger of collapse.\"Hat tip to The Ethicurean for bringing this interesting concept to our attention.

\"Lost\" Eats: Jacob's Stone-Roasted Filet of Fish

Admittedly, this post is straining at relevance, but since I can't get \"Lost\" off my mind, let's talk about the island's latest contribution to things culinary: Jacob's stone-roasted filet of fish.If you don't know what I'm talking about, there's just too much too explain. But, if you did see last night's \"Lost\" finale, you will remember the initial scenes of the episode where Jacob, circa 1800s, trapped a fish, deftly fileted it, and slapped it on a hot rock to cook.So, what exactly was Jacob cooking and what's the significance? I thought it was a red snapper. But, according to all-things-\"Lost\" authority lostpedia, it was (literally) a red herring. A number of bloggers have had said the same, also noting the not-so-subtle double-meaning. Others have noted biblical references to fish, and . . . here's a stretch of a connection . . . \"Also Ben is a Pisces.\"Whatever the case may be, it's definitely a step up from the DHARMA fish biscuits.Images: http://losteastereggs.blogspot.com/.

From the inbox, the PR people for \"The Martha Stewart Show\" send these sound bites from Mayor Michael Bloomberg's appearance today on the daytime television show.In addition to showing off his cookie-baking skills, the Mayor expounded upon his gastromantic techniques:MS: When people ask you about New York City, what are the three things…that are absolutely important for out-of-towners to do, to see, to visit?MB: Well, number one, I would take the Staten Island Ferry over to Staten Island – get off. There are lots of cultural things on Staten Island, but even if you don’t have time to do that, take it over and back. It’s free and you get a phenomenal view of the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island and the skyline of Brooklyn and Manhattan.MS: You don’t know this, but do you know what happened to me on the Staten Island Ferry?MB: What?MS: I got engaged.MB: Mazal tov! I wont asked what happened after that.MS: Well that’s history, but it was very exciting and the view is very nice.MB: I used to buy a six pack of beer and a pizza and take a date…it was very romantic and something I could do. The second thing I would do is go to a Greek diner. Greek diners are something that is unique to New York. There’s a thousands things on the menu; they all cost about five bucks; they come in 30 seconds; and they all taste good. If I was going to eat every meal for the rest of my life in one restaurant, it would be a Greek diner…and then I guess the last thing I would do…Broadway show.

Writers including Zora Neale Hurston, Eudora Welty, and Nelson Algren contributed to the 1930s project which was eventually abandoned as World War II approached and never completed.

Reuters is reporting that ABC is working with celebrity chef Jamie Oliver (and Ryan Seacrest's production company) on a new television series that will give \"healthy makeovers\" to an entire American city. The series will be loosely based on \"Jamie's School Dinners,\" Oliver's school lunch project in the U.K. In the new ABC program, Oliver will travel to unhealthy places in the U.S. and find ways to use local resources to improve eating habits. The target city has not been disclosed, but Reuters reports that \"it's expected to be a place that has been cited on 'fattest cities' lists.\" ABC has ordered six hours of the project from Ryan Seacrest Productions and expects to air the show in 2010.

(Read more here: http://www.jamieoliver.com/jamies-ministry-of-food) Very interesting to see how it works out in the US, the people of Rotherham gave Oliver a tough time when he tried to re-educate them.

food·scape (noun): 1. The aspect of gastronomy characteristic of a particular place. 2. The art of depicting natural scenery using food as a medium.In a May 20 post on its food blog, Grub Street, New York magazine reported on the type of concessions envisioned at the upcoming Atlantic Yards project in Brooklyn:When the basketball arena opens on the Atlantic Yards site in 2010(ish), Nets fans can expect a mythic Brooklyn foodscape. \"There will be counters and stands with knishes, pizza, hot dogs, egg creams, cheesecake — the goal is really to provide a distinct Brooklyn flavor,\"Foodscape is frequently used in academic discourse on food, culture, and society. In the anthology Food and Culture: A Reader, Gisele Yasmeen writes in a chapter entitled \"'Plastic-bag Housewives' and Postmodern Restaurants?: Public and Private in Bangkok's Foodscape,\":I have proposed the term \"foodscape\" to emphasize the spatialization of foodways and the interconnections between people, food, and places. \"Foodscape,\" drawn from \"landscape,\" is a term used to describe a process of viewing place in which food is used as a lens to bring into focus selected human relations. New York Times reporter Kim Severson recently noted the emerging use of a variation on foodscape -- placeless foodscape -- in the food lexicon: \"Latest addition to food activist-speak: 'placeless foodscape.' That means most of America's groceries and restaurants, apparently.\"The phrase has been used by academics to describe places where food systems are not grounded in the local culture. Roberta Sonnin writes in the Anthropology of Food The concept of embeddedness, borrowed from economic sociology, is widely used to characterize these two different types of food systems: at one end, there is the dis-embedded globalized food system, the ‘placeless foodscape’ (Ilbery and Kneafsey, 2000: 319) of countries such as the UK and the US; at the other end, there are the more embedded, localized food systems of countries such as France and Italy, where food products appear to be forever rooted in a particular place.Foodscapes are also found in the world of art.Pictured above is a foodscape by the the photographer Carl Warner, who assembles extremely detailed landscapes created out of food. The Telegraph collected 14 of Warner's images in this gallery of foodscapes. Warner was preceded by Icelandic artist Erro (Gudmundur Gudmundsson), who in 1974 created Foodscape (below), an oil painting filled chockablock with foodstuffs.

This one seems to have plenty of Google hits. Fine research on it, too.
  
There are plenty of \"-scape\" words. I remember watching a sci-fi tv show called \"Farscape.\"
  
Looks like a keeper!

Dave Le added this amazing photo from a Honolulu fish market to the MarketWatch photo pool:\"I shot this at a fish market in the Chinatown area of Honolulu a couple months ago while I was visiting on vacation. I don't remember the exact market, nor did I note the exact species of fish in this shot. They sure did catch my attention, all facing the glass like that, though.\"

Oprah, KFC, at the Center of a Chicken Storm

With a coupon giveaway for a free KFC grilled chicken meal on her website, Oprah Winfrey has unwittingly unleashed a firestorm. On the one hand, the giveaway was so popular that it appears to have created a run on grilled chicken at some of the fast food chain's outlets, angering free food seekers. KFC has denied reports that any riots occurred, but has acknowledged that it had to turn away disgruntled coupon-holders: \"Some customers were upset because they couldn't get their chicken, but there was no riot,\" said Laurie Schalow, a KFC spokesperson.Interestingly, Oprah's move is also earning the ire of those who wouldn't likely dine at KFC under any condition, coupon or not. This group of critics, opponents of factory farming, say that Oprah was wrong to endorse a fast food chain that buys its meat from Tyson, the giant chicken processor. \"Oprah needs to get serious ball-busting for giving away KFC!\" tweeted Paula Crossfield, managing editor of the website Civil Eats.She further called Winfrey \"hypocritical\" for embracing KFC:Perhaps it was all just too much, too kind and too ahead of the curve, all that work she had done recently to expose what truly goes on for chickens and other animals in the factory farm setting. Because now Oprah has decided to bolster one of America’s worst offenders when it comes to support for factory farming, KFC, by giving away two pieces of chicken to every human in America.\"It may seem harmless: a mass market “they want it, so I’m giving it to them” kind of campaign. But because Oprah has marketed herself as one who cares about animals, even getting a “Person of the Year” award last year from PETA, this KFC campaign is a serious disappointment to say the least.\"It ws a call to arms, as like-minded critics quickly started voicing their opposition to Winfrey using the Twitter hashtag #oprahkfc.Stepping back from the fracas, New York Times food reporter Kim Severson tweeted this observation about the KFC kerfuffle: \"How many people crawling up Oprah's pantsuit about the KFC grilled chicken have tasted it? It's contempt without investigation, friends.\"

My husband, sitting next to me and looking over my shoulder as I read this story to him, replies \"so, where can we get one of those coupons?  I'd like to try that grilled chicken!\"

And, there you have it.  

To Paula Crossfield, and her followers out there: Let's stop crucifying Oprah, shall we?  It's a tough economy, and she's giving away free food.  What have you done to feed the hungry humans, lately?  Hmmm...? 

Cheers,

~ Paula

Ummm. Oprah has to widespread of an influence (and she knows it) to be this careless about what she endorses. I'm not crucifying anyone, but she really should have thought this one through. And, if she was interested in getting people fed, how 'bout endorsing farmer's markets (for which people can get food stamp vouchers) and growing your own, or asking people to donate to pantries or encouraging people to take up community gardening. 

And by the way, I do help feed people by volunteering my time at our local community garden, which produces tons (that's right, TONS) of fresh, organic produce that goes directly to those that need it, no coupon or factory farms required.

Honestly, no one tripped when Denny's had folks lined up for miles around it's reastaurants on a recent Tuesday, right. And what's the fuss about eating chickens, or was that beef about where and under what conditions the chickens live; see how insane that sounds? So maybe only people who live under the same horrible conditions as chickens should eat them, grilled or fried.

To Jackie: Ok. How can your food reach me and my family? Your food does not get here, Oprah's coupons did. My son and I went to bed without eating that day because my feet, back and legs were hurting so much I couldn't walk to the nearest KFC. I no longer have a car, and wouldn't be able to pay for gas, anyway. Now I can get a raincheck, but I missed out a great meal. If you have EVER been hungry, you know: that would be a GREAT MEAL for anybody who is H.U.N.G.R.Y. BTW, I would  LOOVE ME some fresh, organic produce! Unfortunately, I can't afford it. How is some of all those TONS going to reach my family?
(And to the vegetarians, just say no thank you to the chicken and get the cole slaw, potatoes and biscuit. If you don't want them, give them to someone in need, don't be spoiled, selfish and unaware of the financial and social situation that surrounds you).

To Barbara:  Repeating your words here: \"My son and I went to bed without eating that day because my feet, back and legs were hurting so much I couldn't walk to the nearest KFC. I no longer have a car, and wouldn't be able to pay for gas, anyway.\"  My question is this...How can you afford internet and a computer but not food?  Not that I care, but I would think maybe getting a job doing pc work at home might be a start....youu know...to BUY FOOD!

Who is actually footing the bill for this free factory food? Oprah? or KFC?

I think it was totally wrong of Oprah to misuse her influence to promote this garbage disguised as chicken. Aside from the factory farming issue, it's very unhealthy. It contains MSG and trans-fat among other unhealthy ingredients. Here's a detailed discussion of why KFC's grilled chicken is unhealthy.

Beard Awards Recap: Star Chefs, Spoilers, and a Slammin' Terrine

Recapping last night's live report from the 2009 James Beard Foundation Awards, Jean Georges won the prize for Outstanding Restaurant, Dan Barber won for Outstanding Chef, Nate Appleman (of San Francisco's A16) won the Rising Star Chef award, and Momofuku Ko won for Best New Restaurant. (Chef/Owners: David Chang and Peter Serpico, New York, NY)Jennifer McLagen's Fat: An Appreciation of a Misunderstood Ingredient, with Recipes, won awards for both Single Subject Cookbook and Cookbook of the Year. The James Beard Foundation has a complete listing of all of the winners.Some highlights from the evening:SPOILER ALERT This had to be the oddest thing. In a strange twist, at 9:00 p.m., the New York Times revealed the winners of some of the most important awards of the evening -- outstanding chef, best new restaurant, and others -- notwithstanding the fact that the awards had yet to be given at the ceremony.How could this happen exactly? According to Washington Post food editor Joe Yonan, it appears that the Beard Foundation sent the Times and other major news outlets the names of the winners in advance, but embargoed that information until 9:00 p.m. (when the awards should have probably been over). Since the ceremony went long, when the Times went ahead and published the winners, they preceded the announcement of the awards at the ceremony.This was certainly a buzzkill if you were watching the ceremony live. But, why does this matter? On the one hand, it's a perfectly understandable mix-up. On the other hand, it was one of those \"see how your sausage is made\" moments when the curtain is pulled back on the delicate dance between public relations and the media (which, in this case, stumbled). Not that the stakes are very high (this was just a food event after all). However, the awards purport to be the culinary equivalent of the Oscars, in which case it was just plain weird to find out that the details of the winners and losers were already being made available to some members of the press. In the age of instantaneous communication of news via the Internet, this kind of charade seems all the more retrograde. What do you think of press release embargoes?SIGHTINGS Up close and personal, we saw Martha Stewart, Mario Batali, Daniel Boulud, Jean Georges Vogerichten, Emeril Lagasse, Rick Bayless, and the bearded dude from Anthrax.BEST BITES It would be impossible to recount the details of all of the tasty dishes served post-ceremony, but favorites included Lidia Bastianich's almond flan, Chanterelle's rice pudding with rhubarb, and Charlie Trotter's terrine of morels and fava beans.

Very proud of my client Sunset's win. You should come see the One-Block in question next time you're in town. Just read your bio and saw you grew up in the Gourmet Ghetto. I call those mean streets my home as well. Actually, I'm in the \"upper gourmet ghetto\" e.g., hills above Chez Panisse. See you 'round town.

A controversial advertising campaign for the ice cream brand Antonio Federici Gelato Italiano brings new meaning to the dessert cliche \"sinfully delicious.\"The sexy ads, which depict a nun and priest on the verge of kissing (while holding a carton of ice cream), is being investigated by a UK advertising standards agency after a complaint was made on the grounds that they are demeaning to people who have chosen a religious vocation. The ads feature the taglines \"submit to temptation\" and \"kiss temptation.\" The food magazine Delicious has refused to run the ads.The ads could be banned by the agency if they are found to violate its advertising code.

Unuseless Inventions: Tomatoes That Don't Leak

***CONTENT
To much fanfare, the British supermarket chain Tesco has begun selling the world's first \"non-leaking tomato.\" Grown in Holland, the innovation is being pitched as a major discovery and a critical solution to the problem of soggy sandwiches, which is apparently a big issue in the UK. “The arrival of the non-leaking tomato may well be heralded by sarnie fans as the best thing to hit the sandwich world since sliced bread,\" said Tesco's tomato buyer Emma Pettitt: As one of the most universally used sandwich ingredients the problem is one that affects millions of people every day in the UK.\"According to Pettitt, a standard supermarket tomato will leak 12 percent of its moisture into the bread within an hour of the sandwich being made, while the non-leaking version tomato loses only 3 percent of is moisture. The Guardian's Susan Smillie got her hands on some of the leak-less tomatoes, which to her \"seemed entirely unappealing in theory, and in appearance,\" and took them for a test drive. She found that \"the new tomato seems to live up to its non-sogginess claims. Said tomato is surprisingly juicier than I expected.\" But, why go to such extremes, Smillie wonders, when there already exists a perfectly fine method of keeping your sandwich bread dry:\"Any sandwich maker worth his salt will have a protective layer of lettuce to one side, and cheese to the other, ensuring maximum bouncage of bread. What you might get is slightly limp lettuce, or wet cheese, but if the moisture has penetrated the bread, you're on to a really bad sandwich, and no breed of tomato's going to do anything for that.\"

No mention at all of taste!
The construction of the sandwich makes all the difference. 
When you have to choose between a simple solution and a very complex solution with the chance of unexpected side-effects, which makes more sense.

Such a bizarre world we live in.

At school, it took them two seconds for the chefs (I'm a culinary school student) to show us how to remove the seeds and liquid from a tomato.

Better to get an amazing tomato and do that than to get a tasteless one where that has been done for you.

After all, if it doesn't taste great, no one will eat it.

Cheers!

British Jam, by Way of France

***CONTENT
Tea Together, a producer of artisanal jams based in northern France, has just opened its first retail store in Millburn, New Jersey.I caught up with owners Nick and Judith Gifford when the shop opened last month.The British couple started their business 12 years ago after leaving busy careers in film and television production for country life in the northern French village of St. Remy au Bois. Before long, they traded film for food and tried their hand as culinary entrepreneurs.\"We wondered what the English could do better than the French\" said Judith, and they hit upon British traditions of breakfast and tea time as their angle. \"You see,\" she explained. \"The French do everything based on lunch and dinner.\"Seizing an opportunity, they started out baking scones (what could be more British?). When they set up shop at the market, the scones attracted a lot of curiosity from the locals, but few sales. Judith recalled that her French customers were bewildered about what to do with them. \"'But, when would you eat these?' they would ask.\" The scones never took off. They eventually found success at making jam, building a substantial wholesale business with 5-star hotels in major European cities (in the U.S., you can find them at the Chateau Marmont in Los Angeles). French mega-chef Alain Ducasse is a fan.Though the jams may be produced in France and use French ingredients, Judith says they are completely British in style. \"French jams tend towards finesse with all sorts of infusions. We wanted our jams to be strong, clear, and intense.\"And, they are.Pure lemon marmalade, made from the whole fruit, is tart -- bracing even -- but delicious.They may be the best jams I've ever had. Apricot and lavender jam is excellent, as is the syrupy Summer Pudding, brimming with raspberry and black currents, and sweet and tart Damson, blended from the typically British plums the company imports from Kent. Tea Together also makes chutneys, savory blends of fruits, spices, and herbs. Unlike traditional chutneys, these contain no garlic or onions.There are 45 flavors of preserves in all, made mostly from organic fruit, unbleached organic cane sugar, and no pectin or preservatives. The small company is comprised of only 10 people (including the owners), and just four people do all the cooking.Squeezed out by high rents in Manhattan, the Giffords have set up shop for their first retail store in tony Millburn, New Jersey.In addition to preserves, the shop also sells imported olive oils, mustards, varietal honeys, salts, vinegar, and pasta. Dividing the store is a long communal table at which the couple hopes to serve coffee, tea, and bread in the future.Tea Together, 356 Millburn Avenue, Millburn, New Jersey 07041 (973.218.6769).

They started out thinking what could the English do better than the French...funny..but a little insulting to the French, especially when they use French ingredients. Jam sounds divine though - I hope their business takes off and comes to the West Coast soon.

In Season: Green Garlic
***AUTHOR

***CONTENT
While I’ve been getting ready for season two of the square foot garden, I was able to harvest one last crop from last year that I managed to reap after a long, cold Winter.During last fall, I decided to try growing green garlic, the quintessential gastronomic sign of early spring.I broke up a head of garlic into cloves and planted them in one of the squares in the garden. Short green stalks shot up quickly, and then they stopped growing and remained like that for the winter. But, as it started warming up last month, they began growing again. Some of the outer leaves, which had withered and started turning brown, were now joined by new ones that were growing fast. When I yanked them out of the ground, the long stalks were still attached to the original cloves, which had burst open and could now be peeled off. What remained looked a lot like scallions, tinged with purple at the white end and perfumed with the smell of garlic. I tasted a bite. While the smell could trick you into thinking you were putting a piece of raw garlic in your mouth, the taste was much, much milder.I combined the green garlic with butter to make a very simple pasta. Once cooked, the green garlic (surprisingly) tasted nothing like scallions or onions, as I had expected. Rather, they became slightly sweet, like the offspring of garlic and leeks if they mated. I leave it to your imagination to envision what that mating process would look like.Fresh Pasta With Green Garlic1 pound fresh pasta2 tablespoons butter4-5 stalks green garlic, finely slicedsalt (to taste)black pepper, freshly ground (to taste) Parmigiano reggiano, grated (to taste)1. Boil water for the pasta.2. Melt butter in a sauté pan, being careful not to let it brown, and add the green garlic.3. Saute on medium to medium-low heat until the green garlic has softened (but don’t let it brown). Remove from heat.4. Cook the pasta. I used cavatelli, which were frozen and required a longer amount of cooking, so I started them before sauteing the green garlic.5. When the pasta is cooked, drain it (reserve cooking liquid), and set pasta aside.6. Return the saute pan to the range, set to medium to medium-high. When the butter starts to bubble, add about 1/4 cup of the water the pasta cooked in and whisk until the butter and water forms an emulsion. Keep whisking while the butter/water reduces slightly (around a minute).7. Add pasta to the pan and toss, adding more water if too dry, and seasoning with salt and pepper to taste.8. Plate and serve the pasta with grated parmigiano reggiano on top.

The green garlic in the photo look very much like ramps.  Are they one and the same? I'm confused.
Josh
2009-04-30 21:29:02
They do look suspiciously similar (and come into season at the same time), though ramps have a fatter bulb and broad, flat leaves. See this pic to compare:

http://tinyurl.com/dj2m87

I believe ramps have a more distinct flavor (also more intense). Have to admit I've never tried them myself, but don't tell anyone.
DocChuck
2009-05-01 15:55:00
Of course, one can Google ramps if confusion exists.  But you will find that the leaves of ramps (called wild leeks in Upstate New York and Vermont) look nothing like those in this photo.

Ramps, in my opinion, are much stronger (and that's not bad) than green garlic.  Also, ramps are generally smaller in size than are green garlic leaves.

Both are wonderful, used properly.

The New York Times Ate My Slogan
***AUTHOR
Josh Friedland
***DATE
2009-04-22 00:00:00
***CONTENT
You may have noticed that The Food Section logo looks a little scantily clad. Gone is the subheading/tagline \"All the News That's Fit to Eat,\" a parody of the New York Times' famous slogan, \"All The News That's Fit to Print.\" Two days ago, I had the surprise of receiving a cease and desist letter from the New York Times demanding that I immediately remove the \"All the News That's Fit to Eat\" tagline because, in their words, the \"use of this similar slogan capitalizes on the good will and reputation associated with the Times's trademark and constitutes trademark dilution and infringement.\" Since I have neither the resources, time, or energy to defend myself against the risk of a lawsuit, I regret to inform you that I decided to cave in.However, I remain perplexed as to why the Times decided to pick on me. I couldn't be the first person to create a spin on the Times slogan. Even a cursory google search of the phrase \"all the news that's fit to\" will produce more than 750,000 results -- web site slogans, article titles, books, and even a couple of music albums. Take theyankeeuniverse.com (\"All The Yankees News That's Fit to Print\"), for example, or prrag.com (\"All the news that's fit to spin\"), or thebrushback.com (\"All the sports news that's fit to print\"). Here's just a small sample of the many words that have been transposed with \"print\": ridicule, byte, fund, aggregate, depress, strip, censor, trip, tint, fake, and dis (my own personal favorite).All the News That's Fit to Sell, a book published by the venerable Princeton University Press, is for sale on Amazon, not to mention All the Art That's Fit to Print (And Some That Wasn't) and All the Math That's Fit to Print. In the field of music, there's folk singer Phil Ochs 1964 album, All the News That's Fit to Sing; lesser known is the Mulchmen's release All the News That's Fit to Surf!I could go on and on. But, if I've learned anything from my googling, it's that my attempt at parody was not so original. In fact, the idea of parodying \"All the News That's Fit to Print\" turn out to be one of the more hackneyed forms of expression in our popular culture. It's the \"Mad Libs\" of cliches.The irony of all this is that not only is \"All the News That's Fit to Eat\" so obviously a parody, this entire web site is a play on the established food media.So, was I annoyed when I first heard from the New York Times? Of course. And, I still am angry. But, I have realized that there's another way of looking at this entire episode. That the Times would take this little one-man operation so seriously that it would marshal its legal department against my alleged \"dilution\" of its brand tells me that the New York Times is paying attention to The Food Section, and that's a good thing. In a backhanded way, it's really very flattering.

\"All the news that fits, we print.\" Oldest joke in the world.  I believe Walt Kelly used it on the cover of a Pogo comic book.  Don't think he was sued either . . .

Have you seen the Times financial situation lately?  Hold off for a few a year or so and you can put it back up without worrying about it, as there won't be anyone at the NYT left to sue you.

You're in good company if that's any comfort. In the 1980s, the Times went after a computer game company called Infocom, which published a fan newsletter called The New Zork Times, Zork being the name of its flagship game. NYT actually sued over that one as if anyone would be confused....More at the URL below.

As Dave said, the Times & other newspapers are going through rough times. I think they've decided to wage war on online mediums including blogs who are growing in popularity. Just look at the silly shenanigans the AP is up to with regards to Google & bloggers. 

The good news is that you probably showed up on the NYT's radar because your readership is growing & they're afraid at some point you'll be a real threat. So in that regard, congratulations!

Wishing you continued success!

Amazing, isn't it, that an enterprise so dependent upon freedom of expression can be so disrespectful of the principle where others are concerned? I understand your desire not to risk a fight, believe me, but I highly doubt they would actually press such an idiotic claim. It's lawyering by threat, and as a lawyer myself, it makes me puke when my colleagues besmirch the profession in this manner.

It's funny that they think that you're not allowed to use a variation of their tagline ... but you are allowed to use an opinion of them as your tagline. So just change it to \"The NYTimes is a bunch of poopyheads who won't let me say that my news is fit to eat.\"

Yes, well, you're also copying their section headings, fonts and design, besides just the slogan.  Indeed, if I said \"You tried as hard as possible to make your blog resemble a section of the NY Times newspaper\", that would be no less than the truth, would it not?

So it's hard to have any real sympathy for you.  You were trying to attract their attention, and you succeeded.  Congratulations.

I recognize that this seems like overkill (and it probably is).  But trademarks have to be policed and defended or they can be lost (or at least diminished in scope and value).  Because the NYT's trademark is famous and therefore can be diluted by use of similar or parodic marks in non-competing fields (as opposed to \"infringed\", which would require some hint at likely consumer confusion), they kinda have to police the mark.  It's an almost automatic function at most large companies -- you just got caught in the crosshairs this time around.  

Not that any of that is much consolation, but it's almost certain that it wasn't personal.  Someone else will get the cease and desist (which we in the trade call \"nastygrams\") next time.

Ech... that really sucks.  I have to say this reminds me the milk commission (or whatever they're called) going after this woman's site promoting breast feeding... she'd created t-shirts with slogans on it that said, I believe \"Got (breast)milk?\" possibly with boobies on it... and I think she had other t shirts that parodied pork being the other white meat?  I forget exactly, but she was really mad - but then she was kind of making a profit off the slogans... so it's slightly different.  I realize you run ads on here but... I don't know.

PS Seth Green is a total expert on parody laws... you should talk to him.  I bet he'd have a solid defense for you.

A New Player in Recipe Search

***CONTENT
Scripps Networks, the parent company of The Food Network, has quietly launched a new website that might just be a \"killer app\" for online recipe search. Currently in \"beta,\" Food.com sports a clean, almost zen design -- lots of white space, a bunch of carrots, a sprig of rosemary -- which stands in stark contrast to the brash style of its sibling site, the Food Network. Food.com is a vertical search engine for recipes and an online repository for recipe collections. Down the road, Scripps also plans to add social media tools to enable commentary and interaction between users.Surprisingly, it's not just a search engine for Scripps' proprietary recipes on the Food Network website and Recipezaar (which Scripps also owns). Rather, Food.com searches all of the major recipe publishers on the web -- from epicurious to Food & Wine (it presently skips over blogs). Unlike these other sites, which search only within their own sites, Food.com's search has no walls. Aside from FoodieView, I believe it's the only recipe search engine of its kind. Using the Food.com website (or a downloadable toolbar), you may select among sites such as epicurious, gourmet.com, Bon Appetit, CHOW, and other outlets, to search for recipes. Enter search terms and Food.com will display the results from all of the sites in a single, scrollable list. Recipe results and searches may also be filtered by variables such as the type of course, cuisine, main ingredient, technique, special diet, and cooking time. Interestingly, Food.com doesn't only list recipe titles from the other recipe sites. It generates a thumbnail photo and -- here's what's unusual -- scrapes the entire ingredient lists as well (see screenshot, right). A link is provided for the user to go to the recipe owner's site for the complete instructions. While ingredient lists are generally understood to be copyright-free, and traffic will ultimately be directed to the recipe owners' sites, this seems like a game-changer for recipe search, and I am very curious to see how the other publishers will respond. Food.com also has a bookmarking feature which enables user's to \"add\" recipes to your \"recipe box\" from other sites not included in the recipe search collection. It's a little clunky right now. The function only works for those sites food.com has \"white-listed\" (the developers told me more sites are being added all the time). Moreover, by adding a recipe from one of these outside sites, Food.com currently only logs the URL and none of the rich information offered on a search of the major publishers.So, is food.com a game changer? It would seem to eliminate the need to go around from site to site searching for recipes, and it also provides a single place to \"store\" recipes found online. Moreover, scraping the ingredient lists allows for a time-saving way to skim through recipes and compare their complexity. What do you think?

It's nice to have but I don't think I'll be using it too often. I generally prefer to look for recipes from sources I like and trust. Some of these sites have very different characters. Recipezaar, for example, has a lot of stuff I would never in a million years want to cook -- knock-off Olive Garden recipes and that sort of thing -- it's just more information to sift through, to have their recipes mixed in with ones from sites I like.

food.com isn't the only one doing this. Project Foodie (http://www.projectfoodie.com) has been around for about 2 years. 

We have similar sources and features, but we also index by publication date so, for example, you can see all recipes published in a specific issue of a magazine.
Sam

This site is removing (or at least obscuring) editorial filters that have real value. Also: 90% of the recipes accessible in beta are from RecipeZaar (ie pretty much worthless).
Anu

I like the idea of it but execution leaves something to be desired. I don't like that I am unable to open up recipes in new tabs, since I like to open up a bunch of recipes at once. This going to a recipe, clicking the back button, going to another recipe thing is way too slow. Also, there doesn't seem to be a way to exclude words or ingredients from searches, which Google does much better. For example I was searching for an Indian-spiced whole roast chicken recipe, but could find no way to exclude words like thighs or pieces or breasts.

Take a look at springpad, also currently in \"beta\" - online notebooks to help manage your life.  http://springpadit.com


You can drop in the URL for ANY recipe & the site will scrape the ingredients for you & also store a link back to the original source for later.


The weekly meal planner allows users to add recipe to specific dates & easily create shopping lists.  There's a new recipe box feature under development, too!

I'd like to know other people's thoughts are on whether or not they participate in the foodie communities (comments, ratings)? Or are they more interested in finding great recipes?  What I've found to be the best recipe search engine is http://www.RecipeBridge.com  They claim to have over 200+ cooking sites, blogs, and magazines indexed for over 1.4 million recipes right now.  Sam, to your point it's the only site that seems to have figured out how to prevent RecipeZaar recipes from dominating the search results.
Cheers!

I also really like Recipe Bridge (http://www.recipebridge.com).  I've been using it quite a bit lately and have found it to be easy AND comprehensive.  A number of times, I've been looking for a recipe that I've made in past but have misplaced.  Recipe Bridge has always found the recipe I was looking for.  It's been a lifesaver.

Nice post, Josh!  I agree with Anonymous_Crab and Sam about the quality of these engines.  

As far game changing goes, I think it will hurt food blogs down the road by reducing traffic to blogs, as it is positioning itself to be a \"go to\" source and is currently excluding blogs.  It appears to be a subtle way of positioning the food-related publications - united - as  \"one voice.\"  

It is exactly the type of marketing effort I would come up with, if I were the marketing consultant to these publications - it's brilliant!  Its success will ultimately depend on how they market to the general population.  It is likely to become popular those who are not so discerning or research oriented, and want a one stop shop (i.e., most of the general population). 

If this takes off with enough marketing behind it, the food blogging community will ultimately need to come up with its own version to adequately compete, which I think is a brilliant idea anyway.  Now THAT is a search engine I would use everyday!

Bill and Andy:  www.recipebridge.com sounds cool.  I will check it out next - thanks!

Cheers,

Have you ever seen a pair of Adidas more, well, fresh than these?With the Consortium Watermelon Forum Mid shoe, Adidas has taken the design of its iconic 1980s basketball shoes and given them a melon-y makeover featuring garish green uppers, stripes that mimic those of a watermelon rind, and a red lining interspersed with pits (sorry, they don't come in seedless).If you want to get seasonal, there's also a low-top \"pumpkin\" version that would fit your fall wardrobe.

Good content. Just wanted to add some buying advice for those on a budget.

There is a huge market for sports shoes but what’s significant is the genuineness of the shoes we intend to buy. Most often we think that a pair of authentic shoes would cost us big money and so we turn to fake shoes which are available at very low prices not realizing the consequences of wearing them in the long run.

However, you will be happy to know that you can still get genuine sports shoes at cheap prices. The only thing that we require is a little bit of research to know which stores stock original stuff and offer good discounts that make genuine shoes affordable and fit our budget. So spend sometime and research online to find where you can shop around, how you can shop and when is the best time to shop.

From Bamboo to Cork

***CONTENT
Bambu, the maker of bamboo kitchen tools and serving pieces, has launched a new line of products made from another renewable material, cork.The earthy material has been pressed into a number of modern designs for bowls, cutting boards, and serving trays. The high-density cork products are lightweight and surprisingly impervious to liquids, and, according to the company, naturally anti-microbial and anti-fungal. Bambu claims the product line is \"the world's first cork tabletop collection.\"I recently gave the cork cutting boards a test drive. Unlike wood (and, particularly, synthetic) cutting boards, the cork boards have a naturally spongy consistency that works like a shock absorber, cushioning the knife (and your wrist) with each slice. They also clean up well, which was a surprise, since I expected the cork would be particularly vulnerable to staining. Juice from freshly cut strawberries left no permanent marks. While there's a benefit to the extremely light weight of the cork boards -- very easy to haul out from the cabinet -- the boards weren't ideal for more difficult cutting maneuvers. For example, the board tended to slip when I worked at splitting and breaking down a whole chicken into parts. A heftier board would have been more effective and reliable.And though the cork does have a natural \"healing\" property that closes up cuts made by a knife, I would be concerned that the occasional misguided slice would end up producing divots, diminishing how long the boards will last over time. Serrated knives would certainly be a no-no.So, while I wouldn't replace my cutting boards with cork ones, they're a welcome addition for those cutting tasks to which they are best suited.Bambu's collection of cork bowls, cutting boards, and serving trays are available at branchhome.com.

Passover Postscript: Pecan Crisps and a Mexican Chocolate-Pecan Cake

I ended up making two desserts this year for Passover. Although I've had a pretty good track record in the previous years, I like the challenge of trying something new, particularly on this flour-challenged holiday, and went with Gourmet's crunchy pecan cookies and Patricia Jinich's flourless chocolate-pecan cake.The pecan cookies were very easy to make (and you really wouldn't suffer eating them any time of year). They contain no flour or matzo meal, just sugar, pecans, cinnamon, potato starch and egg whites. The nutty cookies, enlivened by the cinnamon, are thin, light, and crisp.The recipe indicates that you can make them in advance and store them for up to a week. I made them the same day as the seder, but I would actually recommend baking them earlier. After a couple of days, the cookies lost any chewiness and became completely crunchy (which I preferred).Jinich's cake is a surprising variation of the ubiquitous flourless chocolate cake: a Mexican take on the dessert topped with fresh berries, lime, and sugar. The recipe was a winner. Unlike other flourless chocolate cakes I've eaten, this one wasn't dense or overly rich, which is usually the case.Preparing the cake was shockingly simple (once you melt the chocolate, everything can be combined together in a blender or food processor). And, the topping is incredibly delicious: tangy from the lime juice and zest, and sweet from the blackberries, strawberries, and piloncillo sugar (or brown sugar, which I used). This flavor combination would be amazing as a sorbet or the basis for sweet-tart cocktailI did run into some confusion about how long to let the fruit macerate in the sugar and citrus juice. The recipe, did not indicate exactly how long was appropriate. If I combined it too early, would it be too soggy? Or, did the topping need some time to draw the juice out of the fruit and become something closer to a sauce and less like a fruit salad.Amazingly, I was able to reach Jinich via her blog, Pati's Mexican Table, catching up with her while she was riding a train through the Copper Canyon in Chihuahua, Mexico. She wrote in an email that the topping may be mixed as far as 12 hours in advance (but not more, lest it get mushy): \"I like it best just a couple of hours before, so some juices come out and the fruit absorbs flavors from lime peel, juice and sugar or piloncillo. Consistency should still be firm and give you a bit of a crunch.\"While I had her ear, I also asked her about how finely to grind the pecans (I think I could have ground mine finer). \"It becomes fluffier the finer they are,\" she wrote. \"I like it better like that. But some people like to feel the crunch of the pecans, and have it with more texture. You can play with it!\" Nana José's Chocolate Pecan CakeBy Patricia JinichThe Cake:1/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon unsalted butter or pareve margarine6 ounces bittersweet chocolate1 cup pecans6 large eggs1 teaspoon vanilla extract1 cup sugarDash of saltThe Topping:3 tablespoons grated piloncillo sugar or brown sugarFinely grated zest of 1 limeJuice of 2 limes (approx. 1/4 cup juice)1 pint strawberries, washed, hulled and halved1 pint blackberriesWhipped cream, optional. 1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Line a 9-inch springform pan with parchment paper and grease with 1 tablespoon butter.2. Using a double boiler or pan over simmering water, melt together chocolate and remaining 1/4 cup butter. Set aside to cool. 3. Using a blender, chop pecans finely (to taste). Add eggs, vanilla, sugar, salt and melted chocolate mixture, blending until smooth. Pour batter into pan and bake until a toothpick inserted in center comes out clean, 40 to 45 minutes; cake should be moist but not wet. Allow to cool.4. For the topping: In a large mixing bowl, combine piloncillo or brown sugar, lime zest and lime juice. Add strawberries and blackberries, and toss gently (this may be done up to 12 hours in advance; keep refrigerated). Just before serving, toss again and spoon on top of cake. Serve with whipped cream (optional).Recipe published with the permission of the author.

Scenes from a White House Seder

***CONTENT
The White House has released this photo of the historic White House seder, the first ever attended by a sitting President. The specifics of the meal are scant. Nevertheless, it is possible to discern a couple of interesting details. A close-up analysis of the official photo reveals that the choice of haggadah was cheap and utilitarian (and, presumably, an unintentional product placement). Eschewing a modern reinterpretation like the contemplative A Passover Haggadah (interspersed with commentary from Elie Wiesel), the White House seder went instead with the ubiquitous Maxwell House Haggadah, a supermarket freebie (complimentary with a can of Maxwell House coffee since 1933). Also notable is that it looks like each guest got their own personal seder plate to refer to during the ceremony. A great idea, I think, except for all of the egg-roasting involved. For more information about the event, the Huffington Post has a detailed report on who exactly is sitting around the table, which included President Obama, first Lady Michelle Obama, the first daughters, and senior adviser Valerie Jarrett, among other friends and White House staff.

I didn't know that Maxwell House published a Haggadah (guess it's only in the U.S. and I'm in Canada) until last night. The story of its origins that I heard was that a lot of Jews were giving up coffee during passover because they thought that coffee, being from a bean, wasn't kosher for passover. Maxwell House sought to get the Jews drinking coffee during passover by marketing a hagaddah.

Sounds like a campaign out of Mad Men.

One of the most amazing scenes of the Obama first 100 days.  I too give him a lot of credit for hosting a Seder meal.  This is also a good education for his children.  My mother used to have a Seder meal when I was a teenager and we're Christian.  Props for Mr. President...!

A haggadah is like a program for the seder dinner. At every seder, we discuss the story of Passover and the haggadah includes the story, readings about Passover and often songs.

I grew up only knowing of Maxwell House haggadahs. I didn't even realize there were non-branded versions!

Seder is a ritual that is familiar and comforting for those who celebrate Passover every year.  This is when the leader (President Obama, or in most families DAD) asks the questions of the children or other folks at the table such as \"Why is this night different from all other nights?\" And the child either recites from the Haggadah or from memory the answer.  In this way the tradition is passed down from father to children and to non-Jews (like me!) who are invited to participate (part of the ritual).  I learned to eat horseradish (bitter herb)and gefiltefish(sp)and unlevened bread or matzo.  A lovely and meaningful ritual and I wish I knew a family who would ask me to join their Seder now.  Good Pesach everyone!

We too celebrated our Passover Seder in the Philippines as enlightened completed Talmidim of Yeshua recognizing him as the Lamb of G-d that was slain for our redemption(Isaiah 53. It is through his shed blood that eternal death passed/ passes over us and brings us into life here and in eternity, when we believe in his finished redemptive work on the cross. He is coming back soon for his own as the Conquering King of kings. Maranatha! \"Come, let us reason together says Adonai...\"

No mention that Jesus was cruxified on Passover. First Fruits of Zion (ffoz.com? .org?) has an appropriate haggadah for Christian Passover Seders. Maybe next year at the Wite House. FYI. Passover/Pesach never lands on a Friday and during Jesus' lifetime Friday was also a Sabbath (see Luke 6:1 KJV mention of this Friday \"first\" Sabbath). Therefore, Jesus was not cruxified on a Friday. Holy Week should, instead, be with a Good Thursday and a Maundy Wednesday as it was this year.

We grew up using the Maxwell House Haggadah -- the grey  hardback ones. This was in Huntington, WV in the 50 and 60s, and I don't think we had many choices then. Sitting around the table with my mother's family there were a lot more of us than in this picture. My father led a speed reading.

And yeah I remember the Maxwell House Haggadah.  My family has a small collection of various ones from different shuls, and I have a copy of a hand-lettered one done by a co-worker's late father (he was an illustrator in the 50's).

My family has always used the \"Silverman\" Haggadah, which i think is terrific. This year one of our guests brought a signed copy of Ben Shahn's illustrated Haggadah, which was wonderful to see.


I think it's a shame that at this historic White House seder they chose to use the Maxwell House haggadah, which is really one of the worst out there.


There are quite a lot of fantastic haggadahs out there that would have been far more interesting to the President and his guests, including many that are child-friendly. For a nice review, check out:

My family moved from Brooklyn to Kentucky in the 1920. I was born in 1931 and as a child I can recall many times reading from a Haggadah during a Seder. Our Seders were attended by anywhere from 6 to 28 family members. We had several haggadahas including the one from Maxwell House and alternated using them.

several comments,  starting with my one negative,  to Beth and the ones who commented on her post.  There are no real Jews for Jesus.  there are Apostates who were Jewish but who are now Christian. 

 Now on the topic.  I think that the idea of having a Seder in the White House was a nice idea.  one of the main themes of the Seder is inclusiveness \"Let all who are hungry, come and eat.\"  Also it is a time to include the \"Strangers\" (Not family member) so that we remember that we were strangers in the land of Egypt at one point in time. 

The purpose of the Seder is to teach the story of how we came to be in Egypt, How we came to be enslaved. What slavery entailed.  How we gained our freedom.  How we came to our historical homeland.  The Seder helps us to understand that we are still connected to those who came before us. 

I think that having children learn their own customs, and share them with other children is important.  The Christian children in our own neighborhood were invited to participate in our holidays where it was appropriate;  my very Jewish children went to their Catholic and Protestants home to participate in their holidays where appropriate.  As a result we have knowledgeable adult children who have an understanding of, and respect for each others religious practices.  And if we had had Muslims in our neighborhood they would have been included also.  

On the Maxwell house Hagadah. it was started in the 30's as a giveaway with purchase. At a time when money was scarce,  it afforded many people to have more Hagadahs. At a time when extended families were huge, that was a real blessing. and it hasn't been updated. Over the past 45 years we have collected many, many different Hagadahs.
Beth P.
2009-04-16 18:59:05
Another great modern Hagaddah, especially for all the \"JewBus\" out there, is the Hagaddah for Jews and Buddhists -- a bit new age-y, but very meaningful - I recommend it!

Is Quinoa Kosher for Passover?

One would assume that quinoa would not pass muster for Passover. After all, wheat and other grains (categorized as chametz) are forbidden during the holiday. Moreover, medieval Ashkenazi rabbis also excluded the consumption of kitniyot -- rice, corn, soy beans, and other foods -- might be confused with the forbidden grains or grown near them and possibly comingled.Though similar to chametz grains, it turns out that quinoa is not technically a grain (it's actually a member of the \"goose foot\" family, which includes beets and spinach). In addition, as a new world food, quinoa wasn't even on the radar screen of 15th century rabbis who made determinations about kitniyot and Passover.So, as long as the quinoa is processed in a in a factory with Kosher for Passover certification, it is generally considered to be part of the Passover diet.

Test Kitchen: Suzanne Goin's Creamsicle Floats

***CONTENT
If there was one thing that stood out for me from the New York Times' recent battle of the budget dinner parties, it was the creamsicle floats which Julia Moskin made for her dessert. The recipe, which comes from L.A. chef Suzanne Goin, is barely that -- just a combination of three ingredients: vanilla ice cream, fresh tangerine juice, and seltzer.I loved the way the tart flavor of the tangerine juice was offset by the creamy vanilla ice cream (store-bought in my re-creation, though the recipe calls for homemade).The complete recipe (which serves 6) is available online at the Times website. To make a single serving, add one scoop of vanilla ice cream to a glass with approximately 1/2 cup fresh tangerine juice (about the juice of two tangerines) and top with seltzer (be careful, it foams up). Serve with a straw and a spoon.The recipe got me thinking about other juice/ice cream combinations that might make for delicious floats. If you have any suggestions, leave a comment below.

In Puglia, Southern Italy, we have two very popular ice cream combinations.
The first one is called \"Nocciolino\", which in Italian means the \"little hazelnut\". The recipe is just the combination of: warm espresso (two shots or very long, served in a large cup); and a scoop of hazelnut ice cream.
The combination of the warm coffee with the cold icecream is fantastic!!
The second is called the \"affogato\", which in Italian means \"soaked\". The recipe is just the combination of: truffle chocolate icream, half a glass of Italian Amaro liquor (i.e. Fernet Branca, made with herbs), toasted almonds on top. Again the conbination of the bitter liquor with the truffle chocolate are sublime...
hope you like them....

I haven't tried this but ever since I was a kid I would pour buttermilk into half a glass of orange juice.  No one would believe me that it tastes just like a creamcicle.  (I don't stir--that way you keep getting a different hit of flavor as you sip.)

Why is this woman using sex to sell food allowed on TV but the PETA women simulating sex with veggies banned (from the Superbowl, no less)?  Why I am even asking this?  All one has to do is see the big honking piece of meat next to the big honking hooters, then think about who decides what is allowed on TV or not and there you have it- Big Brother is not only watching, he's deciding what you get to watch as well.

This ad is targeting teenagers from immigrant families who typically don't eat beef or pork (i.e. Hindu or Muslim communities) and telling them that it is sexy to eat bacon burgers without their parents' knowledge.  Padma Lakshmi is a sellout.

People that age in particular have a lot of sexuality that they are feeling. Very normal human stuff and it is the year 2009 folks.

Local Food Shopping for the iPhone

***CONTENT
Serious Eats points to Locavore, an interesting new iPhone app that attempts to add a sheen of high-tech cool-ness to the otherwise mundane task of searching for local seasonal foods.Locavorism...on the iPhone? I gave it a test drive.After you download the app, the software identifies your GPS location and pulls up a list of foods currently in season. This can be depressing if its March and you're in New Jersey (the app, sadly, displays \"nothing is currently in season here\"). But, there is something to look forward to: asparagus, peas, and other green things are shown under another list, \"Coming in season soon.\" Yes! Click on asparagus, and a map of the U.S. springs up showing those sunnier states where spring vegetables might actually be growing, plus links to epicurious (for recipes) and wikipedia. You can also search for specific types of fruits and vegetables (or browse alphabetically) to see when and where they are in season. Click on \"markets\" and Locavore takes you to a list of farmers markets in your area in order of distance from you (oddly, in my case, the market closest to me was listed second). Click on a listing, and a new page gives more details about the market (provided by the localharvest.org). I pulled up my local market in Maplewood, New Jersey, but found out very little (in fact, the page indicated the listing was last updated in 2000 and \"is likely to be out of date.\"). Harrumph!So, the application didn't pan out as being all that useful for me. While I liked seeing current information on what's fresh in my area (this always inspires cooking), even better would be real details on exactly those markets where specific items are available and plentiful (could you imagine what this would do for rampophiles?). Not to mention, how about details on the farms that are selling at these markets (and other retail locations where you might find their goods). I'd also love to see listings for where you can find local meats. As far as the local food movement has come in recent years, I still find that shopping for meats raised locally is very difficult (particularly since they aren't sold in my tiny local market).So, give Locavore a try if you'd like. It's a worthy attempt at making local food shopping iPhone-friendly, though its going to need some improvements before it can achieve the greatness of iPint.Locavore is $2.99 at the App Store on iTunes.

This is cool!  I love cooking great meals seasonally and locally, but it's always hard to find really good produce.  I just got it and found some farmer's markets in my area that I had no idea existed, so I'm going to have to check them out.  Thanks for the info.

Researchers are looking at mussels -- and their impressive ability to stick to things -- to find ways of creating a new generation of bandages and medical adhesives.Less than satisfied with the effectiveness of man-made medical \"glues\" at bonding human tissue -- not to mention their susceptibility to contamination -- Wired reports that chemists are studying how mussels are able to cling so well to rocks, wood, and other materials, particularly in a wet environment.\"The interface between ocean and land has been an important zone in evolutionary history,\" University of Utah biochemist Russell Stewart told Wired. \"Marine organisms exploit multiple bonding mechanisms. By using multiple chemical bonds, they're able to bond to multiple substrates.\"Chemists have even created a prototype bandage using an inkjet printer filled with adhesive proteins taken from mussels. However, artificially replicating how the proteins are structured in mussels' natural adhesive -- key to its strength -- remains a major scientific challenge.

From the Department of Twitter May Be Useful for Something, we learn about the SideSwipe Spatula Mixer Blade (Cook's Illustrated's Christopher Kimball tweets it \"works great\"), a tricked out replacement for the standard Kitchen Aid mixing paddle.Made of reinforced nylon with silicone \"wiper fins,\" the attachment is designed to reduce hand scraping with a spatula. The blade is configured to mix ingredients horizontally and vertically, directing the contents downward and wiping the bowl clean as it rotates. Its creators also claim that it allows chunky ingredients to be mixed easily without being crushed or jammed against the bowl. $24.95 to $29.95, depending on the size blade that will fit your mixer model, at the SideSwipe Store.

I have had one of these for about a  year.  It does work quite well!  There's one caveat: When installing it (the directions do state this) you must raise the height of the adjustment screw a bit by taking a screwdriver to your mixer - which alone, isn't too much of a big deal. But, when you want to use a different mixer attachment - like the wire whip - you'll then need to get out the old screwdriver again and lower the adjustment screw, because otherwise the wire whip won't reach the bottom of the bowl. Basically, it takes a few extra steps and some trial and error to switch attachments.  Food for thought.  ;)

Winegrowers in Provence are angered over European Union plans to allow vintners to make rosé wine by mixing together red and white wines.Rosé is traditionally made by leaving the skins of red wine grapes to macerate with the juice for a short time, which tints the wine pink. The solids are then removed.Provencal vintners are lobbying President Nicolas Sarkozy's government to try to block the EU move, claiming that allowing producers to make rose by any other method would destroy a local tradition. The proposal will be put to a final vote by EU members on April 27.

I find it interesting that people are trying to \"block\" this movement. Why not just allow it? People would still know what the tradition is and actually might be more inclined to buy the \"real\" kind of rose.

Hamantaschen: It's All in the Stirring
***AUTHOR

2009-03-09 00:00:00
***CONTENT
I won't bore you with the story of Purim (though it is a good one). What's more relevant to this site are the holiday's traditional cookies, Hamantaschen. Sometimes they're huge and sometimes their small, but they are always shaped in triangles and typically filled with either jam or a poppy seed concoction not to my taste. I never made them before, but decided to give them a try this year. It was also an experiment in baking with my daughter (which is all the rage these days). She seemed to have fun helping me, except her attention span only lasted for about two cooking steps (the high point being anything involving filling measuring cups and emptying them). After that, she pretty much wanted to strip off her apron and get in a Cinderella dress. I hunted for recipes and settled on one from cookie authority Maida Heatter (see below for recipe) and made two batches: One with the filling in Heatter's recipe (a combination of apricots, prunes, walnuts, and honey) and another batch filled with Amy Scattergood's recipe for homemade Nutella. The homemade Nutella doesn't really resemble the real thing. But, that doesn't mean it it's not tasty. Made from ground, toasted hazelnuts, sugar, and cocoa, it's much more like a chocolate-enhanced nut butter as compared to a hazelnut-flavored chocolate spread (which is what Nutella tastes like to me). The fruit filing came together nicely. You cook dried apricots and prunes and walnuts together with a little water until it becomes thick and jammy. Then add the honey. Easy. The dough was another story. Mine turned out dry, crumbly, and barely sticking together. With just 1/4 cup of butter, one egg, and 1 1/2 tablespoons of orange juice, it didn't bind. (It seemed like the recipe should have called for more butter, eggs, juice, or something). But, I went ahead and wrapped it up it tightly in plastic wrap, hoping that after a night in the refrigerator, it would be fine. The problem may have been in my technique, not the proportions. A reader, Judy Levin, emailed me to tell me that it's critical to carefully stir the dough -- as the recipe instructs -- In Judy's own words: Stir for at least 10 minutes. It may seem like a long time but it’s necessary to completely coat the flour. Don’t be tempted to add more OJ as I have done over the years. It doesn’t really need more. Use a FORK to stir and when all the pieces of dough are coated, test it by squeezing a piece of dough between your fingers. Before you take the dough out of your bowl, make sure there are no dry pieces in the bottom, if there are, you didn’t mix long enough. Once all of the dough looks moist, it still won’t look like a ball of dough in the bowl but it will be ready. Turn the dough out onto a piece of wax paper and push the dough together using the wax paper, not your hands. It will come together beautifully, smooth and moist. It took me a long time to get it right so don’t feel bad if it wasn’t perfect on your first try. The first time I tried this recipe I thought that 1 ½ tbsp of OJ couldn’t possibly be enough liquid. Trust Maida, she was right. Lesson learned. Don't mix the dough in a food processor. Nevertheless, it did improve after chilling, though it was still pretty dry, crumbly, and now hard, to boot. Nevertheless, I was able roll it out in pieces, cut out rounds, and fill the cookies. The sides of the cookies tended to break as I turned them up to form the triangles. But, with some pinching here and there, they all came together. Despite my dough problems, the cookies came out perfectly fine (and even tasted better the next day). And there's also plenty of the fruit filling and homemade Nutella left over to keep enjoying even after the cookies disappear. HamantaschenFrom Maida Heatter's Book of Great Cookies (Knopf, 1977)By Maida Heatter Makes 27 cookies PASTRY2 cup sifted all-purpose flour2 teaspoons double-acting baking powder1/4 teaspoon salt3/4 cup granulated sugar1/4 lb (1 stick) butter, cold and firm1 eggFinely grated rind of 1 bright-colored orange1 1/2 tablespoonsl orange juice Sift together, into a large mixing bowl, the flour, baking powder, salt, and sugar. Cut the butter into 1/2-inch slices, and with a pastry blender, cut it into the dry ingredients until the particles are fine and the mixture resembles coarse meal. Beat the egg lightly just to mix. Stir the egg, orange rind, and juice into the dough. Mix thoroughly and then stir well until the dough is completely moistened and smooth. Wrap in wax paper or plastic wrap, flatten the dough slightly, and refrigerate overnight. The filling may be made the next day or it may be made ahead of time and kept at room temperature for a day or two or refrigerated for a longer time. FILLING12 ounces unsweetened dried pitted prunes (about 2 cups, lightly packed)6 ounces unsweetened dried apricots (about 1 cup, lightly packed)1 cup water1 tablespoon lemon juice1/2 cup honey [these are better with a mild clover honey than with a strongly flavored one]2 1/2 ounces (3/4 cup) walnuts, cut into medium-size pieces Cut the prunes and apricots into small pieces. Place them in a saucepan with the water. Bring to a boil, cover, and lower the heat so that they just simmer for 10 to 15 minutes until very soft. (Some fruits are drier than others -- if the water evaporates before the fruit is soft add another spoon or two of water and cook a bit longer.) Add the lemon juice and honey. Cook, stirring almost constantly, for about 5 minutes (it should not get too thick; it will thicken more while cooling). Stir in the nuts and set aside to cool. When you are ready to bake, adjust two racks to divide the oven into thirds and preheat to 400 deg. Cut aluminum foil to fit cookie sheets. Work with half the pastry at a time; refrigerate the other half. Work quickly or the dough will become sticky. On a floured pastry cloth with a floured rolling pin, roll out the dough, turning it over occasionally to keep both sides floured. Roll it to an even 1/8-inch thickness (that is thin but be careful -- if you roll the dough too thin, it will be hard to handle). With a plain round 3-inch cookie cutter, cut the dough into rounds. (Reserve the scraps of dough, press them together, and rechill until firm enough to roll.) Hold one round in your hand. Place a rounded teaspoonful of the filling in the center, mounding it rather high -- it will not run out in baking. Fold up two sides of the dough -- each side should be a third of the circle -- and pinch them together where they meet, forming a triangle and leaving a generous opening at the top. The filling should extend above the top of the pastry. (If the rounds of pastry become soft or sticky before you shape them, transfer then with a wide metal spatula to a tray or cookie sheet and chill briefly in the freezer or refrigerator only until they are firm enough to handle.) Place the Hamantaschen 1 1/2 to 2 inches apart on the cut foil. Slide cookie sheets under the pieces of foil. Bake for 12 to 15 minutes until the cookies are barely colored on the sides, slightly darker on the edges. Reverse the sheets top to bottom and front to back to insure even browning. If you bake only one sheet at a time bake it high in the oven. With a wide metal spatula, transfer the Hamantaschen to racks to cool, or serve them warm. If anyone is in the kitchen with me when I bake these, very few if any actually have a chance to cool. Reprinted with permission from the publisher.

The doughs with cream cheese in them are a lot better than the butter cookie methods like the one you've described. They end up much more flavorful and tender.

We always have used a sugar cookie recipe that came out of some very old cookbook my mother had.  It's pretty sticky, which is the good and the bad. (Plus, you get a sweet, tasty cookie, which doesn't always happen with hamentashen)  Cream cheese base sounds interesting, though.

I have to say that this is a terrific marketing idea. I hate thinking about all of the emulsifiers and chemically altered shelf-life-improving ingredients that are in the typical pint of ice cream- which is why we usually make our own. (Plus you can't get Bourbon Caramel Pecan in the store!) This is a concept I would try on a late night ice cream run.

it was as bad as industrial ice-cream can be. 
for a 5% fat artisanal gelato is much tastier and natural. It's worth your money much more than a Kg of Haagen Dazs five.

If you stayed up until the bitter end of the Oscar broadcast last night, you may have caught a brief glimpse of \"Julie & Julia,\" the upcoming film adaptation of Julie Powell's book of the same name (which was, of course, an adaptation of her blog, The Julie/Julia Project). Scenes (well, nine seconds, to be precise) from the film were briefly shown as part of a montage of movies due out in 2009, and thanks to YouTube, a fuzzy clip is already online. According to IMDB, the film is slated to open in theaters in the U.S. on August 7.

With Barnaby Barford and André Klauser's novel Still Life Fruit Bowl, you can create a piece of art that changes according to your fruit-buying patterns. The oak frame and earthenware bowl is available for pre-order for $100 at Areaware (though it also looks like something you might try making yourself).

What a bizarre concept!  I guess it would make a cute gag gift for a fellow food blogger, but not at $100!  Sheesh!!!

I'd like to meet whomever buys that, because I have a lot of junk I could hawk off and make bank on.

From the Department of Culinary Mashups comes the Spudski, a potato masher whose design is inspired by ski poles. The masher's unusual grip may be held from the side, slalom style, or with the palm on top. Its creators, Black + Blum, claim that the mashing plate is designed to push the mashed potato \"away from the stem to help it mash faster and almost clean itself.\" $16 in red, green, or black at Charles & Marie.

Greenwashing, Chipotle, and Food Choices

***CONTENT
An interview with Mark Crumpacker, the Chief Marketing Officer of burrito chain Chipotle, reveals some surprising findings about its customers' food choices. While Chipotle has sought to identify its brand closely with a commitment to using ingredients like Niman Ranch meats that are naturally-raised (the chain's motto, after all, is \"food with integrity\"), a recent \"ethnography study\" by Chipotle of its customers found that its emphasis on quality foods was not a major factor for its customers. \"We found that people are coming to Chipotle because they love the food, which is great,\" Crumpacker told Brandweek. \"But we found that they are not using the fact that we spend a lot of time and effort on making all of our food as sustainably and naturally-raised as possible. We all assumed that that was a big driving factor. Even people who were coming to Chipotle for a long time, they appreciate it, but it’s not the reason they are coming in. They just love the way the food tastes. That was a little bit of a surprise to us.\" You have to wonder about the impact of any messaging about organic/natural/sustainable ingredients on consumer food choices when such strong, mass-marketed branding like Chipotle's is found to have such little influence. At least when it comes to burritos.

This is not surprising.

As another mass market quality brand says, \"food should taste good.\"

As a marketer of locally grown foods for 9 years, I found that the assumptions that existed in the campaign planner's minds prior to launch (people want SUSTAINABLE local food) were quickly dispelled by some  basic market research.

The challenge in planning a marketing campaign of any kind is that you think your beliefs are generalizable to the broader community. But more often than not, your beliefs and those of your colleagues and associates are like the skin on an apple. Apparently everywhere,  but dwarfed by the true majority.

People want food to taste good first. They they want it to be from their community, and to support community economic development and self reliance. Organic eventually showed up on our surveys in 5th place.

This study shows more about the myopia of Chipotle grill than anything else.
Alison

You could turn this on its head and say Chipotle is succeeding with quality foods--if you consider quality=tasty food. Busy customers may not take the time to evaluate Chipotle's green practices, but they do know they can get an affordable good lunch.

Although Chipotle's customers may overlook the company's commitment to sustainable food, Chipotle's growth still demonstrates that fast food can be achieved sustainably. And that's a good thing. I think this is something the industry, rather than consumers, takes note of.

I gotta argue that the two points work together. Anyone that has tried grass fed beef along side your mega beef slaughter house type is going to taste the difference. 
I would argue that Chipotle tastes as good as it does BECAUSE it is \"food with integrity\". Quality ingredients mean a better eating experience. And I mean flavor, and digestion.
Cris Melo
2009-03-08 12:07:42
I beg to disagree. It matters to me that they use good ingredients, and that's why it tastes good. This is like the chicken and egg issue: there's no way to separate both things; and I hope Chipotle is not using this \"data\" as an excuse to slack. That would drive me away as I've been driven away from countless places.

People that say organic doesn't matter to the consumer may be missing the point. Organic costs more and not everyone can afford it. Perhaps that's the reason their \"surveys\" turn out to put this as a last factor. Most consumers have been brainwashed to the extreme into not minding what goes on their food as it's being produced.

Good, nutritious, sustainable and humane food sources DO MATTER.

Bravo has announced the panel of judges for its upcoming \"Top Chef\" spinoff, \"Top Chef Masters.\" Saveur editor James Oseland (above right), former New York magazine restaurant critic Gael Greene (center), and British food critic Jay Rayner (left) will serve as the judges. Kelly Choi, of of NYC TV's restaurant show \"Eat Out NY,\" will be the host. The reality series will feature a competition between 24 established chefs for the title of \"Top Chef Master\" and a prize for the charity of their choosing. More details from the press release: \"As previously announced and on the heels of the highest rated season yet for the Emmy and James Beard Award-winning No. 1 food show on cable, \"Top Chef,\" comes the spin-off \"Top Chef Masters,\" produced by the Magical Elves with consulting producer Tom Colicchio. Food journalist Kelly Choi will serve as the series' host, and renowned restaurant critic Gael Greene, culinary expert James Oseland and food critic Jay Rayner will serve as judges. The show will feature 24 world-renowned chefs competing against each other in a series of weekly challenges, as only one chef will make it to the finals to compete for the title of \"Top Chef Master\" and a prize for the charity of their choice. \"Top Chef lovers rejoice, Bravo and the Magical Elves are teaming up again to bring more of what our fans love most, fabulous food and tasty competition – and this time we're adding world-renowned chefs competing against each other to the menu,\" said Frances Berwick, Executive Vice President and General Manager, Bravo Media. Kelly Choi, food journalist and creator, producer and host of NYC TV's weekly restaurant show \"Eat Out NY,\" will host this highly competitive spin-off uniting some of the brightest stars in the world of food, showcasing the often cutthroat world of the culinary arts. A former model, Choi recently finished her book called \"The 20 Most Delicious Dishes in New York,\" which is set to hit stores in spring of 2009. Joining the judges' panel is Gael Greene, New York Magazine's famed restaurant critic for over 40 years, a best-selling author and co-founder of Citymeals-on-Wheels, which provides food to the homebound elderly. Along with Green is James Oseland, culinary expert and Editor-in-Chief of Saveur magazine, and British journalist, writer and broadcaster Jay Rayner, who will also serve as regular judges for the series. Each episode of \"Top Chef Masters\" holds two challenges for the chefs. The first is a twist on the classic quickfire challenge which tests their basic abilities and the second is a more involved elimination challenge designed to test the versatility and invention of the chefs as they take on unique culinary trials such as working with unusual and exotic foods or catering for a range of demanding clients. The food will be tasted and evaluated by the judges and a wide range of tasters for whom the challenge is aimed, whether it is patrons at a five-star restaurant or a room full of hungry kids – the food has to appeal to the diner as well as the critics if the chef is to survive.\"

How many ways can you re-engineer a towel? From the minds behind the somewhat Elmo-esque Grab&Dry dish drying gloves comes the Zip&Dry, which mashes up an apron and a terry cloth dishtowel. Instead of wiping your hands all over your apron, the idea is to use the removable towel, which can be zipped off and washed separately. Available in blue, gray, and green (with contrasting towel) for $39.95 at Just Perfect.

Foes of Foie Gras Challenge How It's Advertised
***AUTHOR
Josh Friedland
***DATE
2009-01-27 00:00:00
***CONTENT
The latest salvo in the foie gras wars comes not from a court room, city council meeting, or state legislature, but from an advertising industry forum that reviews disputes over truth and accuracy in advertising. The National Advertising Division (NAD) of the Council of Better Business Bureaus announced in a press release issued yesterday that it has recommended that D’Artagnan Inc. discontinue certain advertising claims made for its foie gras products. As part of the advertising industry's \"self-regulation\" program, the NAD considers cases involving disputes over truth and accuracy in national advertising. While the complaints are typically made by an advertiser's competitors, in this case the challenge came from an organization, the Humane Society of the United States (HSUS), which has been pursuing a vigorous, multi-faceted campaign against foie gras production. NAD reviewed D'Artagnan's \"Internet advertising\" (essentially, the D'Artagnan website) following a challenge made by HSUS over two \"express claims\" about its foie gras: (1) \"The liver is not diseased, simply enlarged,\" and (2) \"Animals are hand-raised with tender care under the strictest of animal care standards.\" The Humane Society argued that these claims implied a series of messages it deems false, namely that artisan duck foie gras is \"not produced by force feeding, \"produced by healthy animals,\" and\"produced humanely.\" Following a review of evidence submitted by both sides, NAD concluded that D'Artagnan had not adequately substantiated the first claim about the health of the duck liver. It also found that the second claim about how the ducks are cared for \"suggests a level of care and oversight that is not supported by the evidence provided by the advertiser and is inconsistent with the evidence in the record.\" In response to the NAD recommendation to disband the two claims, D’Artagnan indicated that it \"strongly disagrees with NAD’s decision but nonetheless will comply and modify its advertising.\" A visit to the website shows that D'Artagnan has replaced the disputed language. The statement that \"The liver is not diseased, simply enlarged,\" which appeared in a backgrounder on foie gras, now reads \"According to published research * (partially funded by animal welfare agencies), the liver is enlarged but not diseased\" (two sources are cited in a footnote). The reference \"Animals are hand-raised with tender care under the strictest of animal care standards,\" which appeared in a product description for Sonoma Valley Ready-to-Cook Artisan Duck Foie Gras Lobe, now reads \"The ducks are hand-raised with tender care, surpassing governmental requirements.\" When reached for comment, Lily Hodge, Director of Public Relations at D'Artagnan, said that the company considered appealing the NAD recommendation, but determined that pursuing such an action would be onerous: \"We don't have the lawyers, the time, and the budget to do that,\" she said. \"We don't have a battery of lawyers like they do.\"

Thanks for posting this story, but I am curious why there isn't a single link to The Humane Society's website regarding foie gras where there are three links to D'Artagnan. Perhaps you didn't have a chance to search for it. Here's the link for your reference: http://www.humanesociety.org/farm/camp/ffa/

Good point about linking to HSUS (I have updated the post with a link to the campaign page). The links to D'Artagnan are only there in order to point readers directly to the sources of the language disputed in the challenge.

As there are no governmental requirements for the care of food animals, I guess if the animals are alive at all they are \"surpassing governmental requirements.\"  Food animals are exempt from the federal Animal Welfare Act and all state animal cruelty laws.  They have no legal protections except during the slaughter process, and poultry are exempt even from that.  Fraudulent advertising!

The inauguration of Barack Obama is quickly taking shape as a monumental event: a record-breaking 2 million people are estimated to descend on Washington, DC, to witness the ceremony, MSNBC has announced it plans to carry a simulcast live in movie theaters across the nation, and the television broadcast could be one of the most-watched events ever on TV. Naturally, it has spawned a small industry of marketing gimmicks to exploit the surge of attention being directed at January 20th. And, according to a series of new promotions, it looks like the food industry is getting in on the act, too. For the fromage-loving politico, the venerable cheese monger Murray's Cheese has created a special package of American-made cheeses \"chosen just for this historical occasion!\" The GObama Spread ($60 for 4 to 8 guests) includes \"rich Meadow Creek Grayson hailing from DC-neighboring Virginia, mushroomy Constant Bliss (named for a Revolutionary War scout!), supple Tomme de Brebis from Hope Farm, and economically-sound (and delicious!) Sole Gran Queso. Mix it up with spicy Windy City Wasabeans and crunchy Urban Oven Crackers.\" Enjoy rich Meadow Creek Grayson hailing from DC-neighboring Virginia, mushroomy Constant Bliss (named for a Revolutionary War scout!), supple Tomme de Brebis from Hope Farm, and economically-sound (and delicious!) Sole Gran Queso. Mix it up with spicy Windy City Wasabeans and crunchy Urban Oven Crackers.\" Need something to drink with that? I recently received a press release from Grey Goose with recipes for three \"presidential cocktails\": the honey and citrus infused \"Inaugural Partini\" (\"garnish with star anise and relish with pride\"), \"Obama On My Mind, a blend of vodka, vermouth, and blood oranges (\"top with sparkling wine for a drink that's as promising as America's future,\" and \"Barack's Cooler,\" a blend of vodka and pomegranate juice (\"present with orange zest. Toast with zeal\"). If you plan to dine out on the big day, Savoy restaurant is featuring a menu of \"passed hors d'oeuvres that represent some of the greatest hits of Chicago food, prepared by Chef Ryan Tate (who hails from the Windy City): deep dish pizza, wieners with cucumber relish, and \"Second City\" smoked BBQ.\" Savoy's sister restaurant Back Forty will hold a dance party at Back Forty: \"Snacks will be served at a buffet table and passed by waiters, and a selection of cocktails and beers (including 'Hop Obama' Ale from Sixpoint Craft Ales) will be for sale at the cash bar.\" A portion of the proceeds will support the non-profit Brennan Center for Justice.

As Serious Eats notes, it \"looks like 'Tampopo' meets 'Lost in Translation.'\" If you've never seen the original Tampopo -- a \"noodle Western\" interspersed with a series of satirical vignettes about food culture -- this might sound like a bizzarro \"Saturday Night Live\" skit (or just a bad dream). But, it's apparently for real, as this trailer for the film will attest: Media8entertainment provides a synopsis of the forthcoming \"The Ramen Girl\": \"Abruptly abandoned by her boyfriend, a young American woman (Murphy) finds herself suddenly alone and adrift in Tokyo. Lost in the shuffle of a foreign culture, and seeking to console herself, Abby winds up hanging out in her neighborhood ramen shop. After observing the magical effects of the shop's ramen on the customers, Abby convinces herself that her true path in life is to become a ramen chef. Abby persuades the shop's tyrannical, temperamental Japanese master chef to teach her the art of making ramen. And although their relationship is contentious and rocky, they both discover the most important ingredient of all - that each ramen bowl must contain a universe of feeling and truly be a gift from the heart.\" For a taste of the original, here's a memorable clip where the noodle master instructs the proper way to consume (and appreciate) the perfect bowl of ramen:

Just a note that Tampopo is available for purchase as a DVD, but it is one of a very few such films that Netflix does not rent!

Tampopo is one of my favorite films (I own a copy and it sits on my kitchen shelf). I can't imagine it being ANY better than the original, but I will definitely have to see \"Ramen Girl\". Thanks for the heads up!

Why don't they just leave the original perfection alone. It's so sad the way that Hollywood is bankrupt of its own ideas...

Wait wait wait...please tell me this is a joke.  It's a joke, right? I mean come on...Tampopo is an amazing movie that does not need to be tainted by a horrible American remake or something...

Not only is it stupid to remake a film like this -- it'll be even worse than the remake of \"Shall We Dance?\" -- but the article writer doesn't even seem to understand the film either. Didn't he or she notice that \"the noodle master\" character is a fiction, from a silly book read by the cowboy's sidekick, which starts the whole ball rolling because both he and the cowboy think the book is stupid? Let's just hope that Hollywood reviewers actually see the original before they make comparisons.

I can't believe they are doing a remake with Brittany Murphy. That doesn't sound right. I love the original Tampopo and always apologize to my pork after moving it aside :) I have very low expectations for the new version - but I'll probably see it anyway. Thanks for the tip Josh!

Generally, I, too, have been let down by American re-makes of great flicks (witness \"No Reservations\" up against the original \"Mostly Martha\", as well as \"Shall we Dance?\" mentioned by Thom), so I'm not likely to watch this.

The ONLY smidgeon of hope I hold is the potential that this new movie will be as good to \"Tampopo\" as \"Tortilla Soup\" was to \"Eat Drink Man Woman\" - the Sunday meals were the STARS of that remake!  Actually, I thought of \"Tortilla Soup\" as the emotional inside-out version of the original - nobody held back anywhere.

How sad.   It's like the \"Karate Kid\" meets \"Tampopo\" without the best of either.  It's like \"Lost in Translation\" only in the respect that both involve confused blondes in Japan.

Hopefully it won't be the like the pitiful remake of Mostly Martha, I'll forget the name for now with Catherine Zeta Jones..

Funny - I've been showing that Tampopo clip above in my cooking classes for the past two years at www.tastedc.com events...somebody is paying attention!

Thanks for this great post.  How did I not know about this remake???

I actually just blogged on this movie and other food-related media in December, should you be interested.

I agree with other comments about Brittany Murphy. Oh well, that's Hollywood for ya.

Hopefully the remake will shine a light on the original.  It is amazing to me how many people have never heard of Tampopo.  It is my all-time favorite film.

Cheers,

Genes, Geography, and Taste

A recent study into the genetics of taste provides new insights into global variation in the sensitivity of humans to different flavors. Surveying residents of Kenya and Cameroon, the researchers discovered that these African populations were more sensitive to bitter tastes than Europeans. The Kenyans and Cameroonians were observed to have a very high level of diversity in a gene called TAS2R38, which detects bitter flavors, and they were able to sense more subtle ranges when given a bitter-tasting compound to taste. Scientists don't yet understand the reason for the difference between peoples from the two continents, but speculate that it may be linked to an evolutionary benefit that gave Africans the sensitivity to identify plants and vegetables that were beneficial to eat (but also bitter). So, why did Europeans lose this advanced sense of taste? One theory suggests it was due to the lack of genetic variation in those small numbers of Africans migrants who would became Europe's ancestors.

Wine Gift Bags Aren't Just Cheesy, They're Criminal

You know those slim, often cheesily decorated wine gift bags which are ubiquitous in wine shops? Well, a liquor shop in Rochester, New York, has been fined $10,000 by the New York State Liquor Authority for selling the bags. Apparently, according to New York state law, selling gift bags in a liquor store constitutes running a second business, which can be penalized with a hefty fine. The owner of the store says that he expects to lose as much as $20,000 in gift bag sales during this holiday season.

How ridiculous is this? FGS...go after criminals! I cannot believe, bureaucracy at it's finest here. I'm for the wine merchant. It might be 'cheesy', but I've NEVER had anyone object to receiving a nice bottle of wine in a gift bag before. In fact, I don't think it's cheesy at all. If someone gives ME wine, I appreciate the fact it isn't delivered in a 'brown paper bag', which hints at illicitness to me.

Your gift bag story reminded me of the best gift I received recently; a food tour of Chicago!  We know Gastronomes are for Obama, so we know Chi-town has great food.  If you like wine, cheese, and everything else specialty food wise, I'm a huge advocate now of sending people on chicago tours of food, or in any city that has a food tour.  They are the best way to learn the area, the history, architecture, and of course learn about all the local foods.  We tried the Near North Food Tour.  We found them at http://www.chicagofoodplanet.com and hope this helps readers who are looking for great gift ideas in any city that has a food tasting tour!

Going \"Trayless\" to Cut Food Costs, Waste
***AUTHOR
Josh Friedland
***DATE
2008-12-22 00:00:00
***CONTENT
As a measure to cut food costs and reduce the amount of wasted food, the trade magazine Restaurants & Institutions reports that many college and university dining programs are \"going trayless.\" Foodservice managers have found that when trays are eliminated from all-you-can-eat cafeterias, students take less food. As a result, less food also goes uneaten and ends up in the trash. Additional environmental benefits come from eliminating the need to wash the trays, resulting in less use of detergents and savings in energy and water. The solution makes sense in the same way that Dr. Brian Wansink has shown how the size of a plate can influence portion size and how much a person eats. It begs the question as to whether going trayless may not only eliminate waste, but also lead students to cut back on their calorie intake. Could traylessness even spell the end of the dreaded \"freshman 15\"? Aramark Higher Education, a provider of dining services to colleges and universities, claims that those schools which have removed their trays have seen a 25% to 30% drop in food waste per person. The company estimates that half of its 500 campus partners will be trayless by spring 2009.

You're on to something with the idea that going tray-less = eating less food. 

I remember my college days... filling up the tray with a bowl of this and a plate of that, just because the tray provided a way of carrying it ALL back to my table in one easy swoop. Yep - not too surprisingly, I gained the Freshman-15 and contributed a few more dishes to the dishwasher than were really necessary. 

The think the idea of going trayless is wonderful! It decreases food waste, encourages conscious eating (Am I full? Do I really want another ice cream sundae?), and exchanges a bit of the fast food cafeteria like feeling for a more cozy, family-style atmosphere... simply by getting rid of the ugly pastel colored trays.

Actor Jeremy Piven to Enter Sushi Rehab

***CONTENT
I never thought there would be an intersection between my \"Entourage\"-watching habit and matters of the gullet, but actor Jeremy Piven (who plays Hollywood agent Ari Gold on the show) is apparently a victim of eating too much sushi. As was widely reported yesterday, Piven has withdrawn from his role in the Broadway play \"Speed-the-Plow\" after discovering unusually high levels of mercury in his bloodstream. The diagnosis was made after he complained of fatigue, dizzy spells, and failing to remember his lines. According to his physician, Dr. Carlon Colker, Piven's mercury levels were roughly six times what the body can handle. His diet is blamed for the mercury poisioning. \"He was eating sushi twice a day and taking some Chinese herbs,\" Dr. Colker told E! News. \"I tested his heavy metals and his mercury was amazingly, shockingly high.\" According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), exposure to mercury \"may result in severe damage to the nervous and reproductive systems and may ultimately be fatal. Common symptoms of mercury poisoning are poor coordination and altered sensory perception. Pregnant women and children are especially vulnerable to mercury exposure. The most common cause of mercury poisoning in the United States is the consumption of fish contaminated with methylmercury.\" This is not to say that everyone agreees that mercury poisoning can be attributed to fish. The National Fisheries Institute (NFI), a fishing industry trade association, denies the link entirely. In a letter to the New York Times disputing a January 24, 2008 article on sushi and mercury, Mary Anne Hansan, Vice President, NFI, wrote, \"You say that you don’t know whether it’s true that not a single American has ever been clinically found to have mercury toxicity from fish consumption. I’d say that before you run a front-page story on the topic, that ought to be one of the first facts you should nail down. It’s easily confirmed by federal agencies and major medical organizations and the answer is this: zero.\" The FDA and EPA advisory on fish consumption mainly targets women who may become pregnant, pregnant women, nursing mothers, and young children. It recommends limiting consumption to 12 ounces (2 average meals) a week of fish lower in mercury. Let's say Piven had two six-ounce portions of tuna sushi five days per per week, he would have exceeded the FDA advisory in just one day. According to a the Natural Resources Defense Council's mercury calculator, the mercury intake for a 5' 10\" (this is disputed, but we'll give him the benefit of the doubt) white male of average weight (170 pounds for a 43-year old this size) consuming 12 ounces of Bigeye and Yellowtail Tuna per day would average an intake of 1.69 micograms per day, more than 15 times the EPA recommendations. Interestingly, Piven's bout with mercury poisoning has occurred just as the FDA indicates it may be reconsidering it's original advisory limiting seafood consumption. There's going to be a huge debate over any attempt to reverse current policy, and one wonders if such a public case might be influential. What's next for Piven? Playwright David Mamet told Daily Variety, \"My understanding is that he is leaving show business to pursue a career as a thermometer.\"

Too bad Jeremy didn't know about sustainable sushi - the top of food chain predators that are heaviest in mercury - are also the ones we should be avoiding. Had he made some new, sustainable choices, instead of endangered tuna, he might not be watching his understudy from a hospital bed. 

And anyone who's taking Chinese herbs these days, I'd say one word: melamine. Just who do you think is inspecting or ensuring your food is safe?

Speedy recovery Jeremy.

Want to smell like a burger, but don't want the mess of rubbing one all over your body? Burger King has introduced FLAME, \"the body spray of seduction, with a hint of flame-broiled meat.\" On its website, Burger King presents the novelty as if it were the aromatic equivalent of a Barry White song (spray some on and \"set the mood for the flame to ignite\"). This might be the beginning of a whole new line of fast food-based perfumes: after all, as one reviewer asked, \"can I get fries with that.\" $3.99 at Ricky's [Via CHOW].

So, how bad is the economy? The latest indicator may be the plummeting sales of Champagne. While Champagne shipments increased by an average of 2.2% per year for the past two decades (and America’s consumption rose by 3.5% annually for the past five years), they are now plunging, down 10% from one year ago. One of the worst to be hit is Laurent Perrier, whose sales were 30% lower in the third quarter of 2008 than in the same period last year.

I'm sorry, that WASN'T my last comment. I spoke in haste, as the first page I clicked on must have been the worst of the bunch. I went back, and found some really great boxes. I registered to bid, I know the ones I like and will check towards the end to see where the bids stand. Of course, the ones I like the very best are already out of my price range, but I am hoping the others stay within a reasonable price range. Some of these are well worth looking at.

Grading Supermarkets on Seafood Sustainability

***CONTENT
Greenpeace released new rankings today for its \"seafood sustainability scorecard,\" first introduced in June 2008, which grades 20 national and regional U.S. supermarket chains on the environmental impact of their seafood purchasing and sales practices and policies. The new scorecard gives a \"passing\" grade to four supermarket chains -- Whole Foods, Ahold USA, Target, and Harris Teeter -- for scoring more than 40% on Greenpeace's scale (all 20 chains were given a failing grade last June). Trader Joe's was ranked the lowest (#17) of all of the national supermarket chains surveyed. The stores were evaluated on their development and implementation of sustainable seafood policies and practices, transparency and labeling, and the number of species for sale on Greenpeace's \"red list\" (which includes fish such as orange roughy, swordfish, and Chilean sea bass). \"While many supermarkets seek to green their image, the bottom line is that they are contributing to the crisis facing our oceans,\" said Greenpeace’s Oceans Campaign Director John Hocevar in a press release. \"The initial steps being taken to implement sustainability policies and practices are the right ones, but bigger strides are needed to prevent the collapse of our marine ecosystems.\"

For the first time, Greenpeace also included a Green Seafood Grocers section. These retailers actively engage with the NGO community through partnership with FishWise, a nonprofit seafood consultancy. According to the Greenpeace methodology, these companies are the \"greenest\" purveyors of seafood. By using the look up by state feature, you may find a FishWise member retailer near you!

\"Top Chef\" Fact Check: Are Spherical Olives New American?
***AUTHOR
Josh Friedland
***DATE
2008-11-24 00:00:00
***CONTENT
You may have been surprised as I was when Fabio's dish of beef carpaccio with \"spherical\" olives was crowned the winner of last week's \"Top Chef\" elimination challenge. I was particularly puzzled at how the olives, created with a technique borrowed from avant garde chef Ferran Adria, could even meet the competition's basic requirement -- to prepare a lunch menu of \"New American\" dishes. Impeccably sourced California olives brined in small batches from an American artisanal purveyor, sure! But, a concoction of olive puree and alginate to form jelly-coated balls -- huh? I don't doubt that Fabio's dish was the best tasting of the competition. But, if this was New American cuisine, what does New American mean anyway? In the Oxford Companion to American Food and Drink, Cathy Kaufman notes the movement emerged more than two decades ago, when chefs such as Larry Forgione, Michael Romano, and Michael McCarty, \"applied nouvelle cuisine's central tenets of impeccable ingredients, creatively manipulated, to existing American culinary traditions.\" One also thinks of Alfred Portale, Jonathan Waxman, and Judy Rodgers. In The Food Snob's Dictionary, David Kamp's guide to the world of gastronomy, he defines New American cuisine as an \"ambiguous label used to describe cuisine prepared by American chefs who cook with indigenous ingredients but don't hew to French-based kitchen orthodoxies.\" I emailed Kamp to elaborate and comment on the New American-ness of Fabio's spherical olives:\"'New American' is an inherently vague and slippery term, and has been since it came into currency in the early 1980s. In my romantic mind, the term should evoke some rustic bit of culinary Americana given a modern twist, e.g., roasted Hudson Valley capon with porchetta-style herb stuffing and, oh, a goat-cheese timbale on the side--the gastronomic equivalent of the Band's rockified old-tymey songs on 'Music From Big Pink.'\" \"But not everyone thinks this way,\" Kamp writes \"Wolfgang Puck has said that the pizzas he created at Spago in 1983 were quintessentially New American: Italian pies as reinterpreted by a French-trained Austrian immigrant who canvassed L.A.'s Jewish delis and Japanese fish markets. So, in that light, it's not necessarily a stretch for the 'Top Chef' guy to pass off his yolky, moleculista olives and Italianate carpaccio as New American.\" Previously:\"Top Chef\" Fact Check: Is a Vinaigrette an Emulsion?

Turkey Technique: The Dry Brine
***AUTHOR
Josh Friedland
***DATE
2008-11-19 00:00:00
***CONTENT
In the Los Angeles Times, Russ Parsons shares a turkey cooking technique inspired by Judy Rodgers, the chef/owner of San Francisco's Zuni Cafe. He calls it \"dry-brining\": \"You just salt the turkey a few days in advance, give it a brisk massage every so often to redistribute the salt, and then roast it.\" The salt releases moisture from the turkey, which gets reabsorbed by the meat, essentially brining the bird in its own juices. While wet-brining -- soaking the turkey in a saltwater solution -- has become a very popular way of preparing turkey, Parsons notes the technique often leads to a spongy texture. On the other hand, dry-brining leaves the turkey \"firm and meaty.\" While the technique is straightforward, make sure you leave enough time for the turkey to brine (three days), though Parsons writes that you can cut it back to two days.

I'm planning to try the dry-brining technique this year. I've heard so many good things! I'd been a little concerned about buying a fresh turkey so far in advance but when I called my butcher they said as long as it stays in the fridge it should be fine.

Btw, I found your blog through your wife. She'd suggested I check it out and I'm very glad I did!

Anyone know if the same amount of time should be used for just the breast?  I'm guessing the two days would be enough; I'm definitely trying this this year. I've always wondered if the wet-brining..in addition to that weird texture.. also makes it more difficult to dry the skin enough to get it crisp.  At least it seems to for me, unless I'm just not patient enough.  And a breast isn't in the oven long enough to get a really nice crisp skin if it is even a little wet. This sounds like the answer.

After reading about this in Bon Appetit I wanted to practice it on a whole roasted chicken before committing to a turkey. I'm sold! It was so easy to do, combining salt w/ seasoning really enhances the effect.

i'm guessing that if you vacuum-sealed the dry-brined turkey(is there a bag big enough?), the process would be quicker. try adding other flavorings(orange, herbs, spices), in addition to salt.

\"Top Chef\" Fact Check: Is a Vinaigrette an Emulsion?
***AUTHOR
Josh Friedland
***DATE
2008-11-17 00:00:00
***CONTENT
If you tuned into the premiere episode of season five of \"Top Chef\" last week, you may have witnessed a moment that seemed to capture the (entertaining) absurdity of turning cuisine into fodder for a reality show: A curious argument broke out between Stefan, the smug, Finnish-born, German-raised caterer, and Danny, the Long Island-based chef and resident New Yawker, over whether or not a vinaigrette is an emulsion. The conversation went something like this: STEFAN: A vinaigrette is a vinaigrette. DANNY: It's an emulsion. The technique of making vinaigrette is an emulsion. STEFAN: A vinaigrette is not an emulsion. DANNY: Emulsion! STEFAN: Come on! Get a life! So, is a vinaigrette an emulsion? Seeking a definitive answer to this critical question, I lugged out my copy of Alan Davidson's Oxford Companion to Food and looked up vinaigrette, which was defined as \"a 'mixture' (inverted commas because oil and vinegar are, strictly speaking, immiscible) of olive or other oil with vinegar (or lemon juice or the like or a combination of some vinegar and some lemon juice).\" This put me in the mood for a salad, but there was no mention of the word \"emulsion,\" so it didn't solve our conundrum. I consulted writer Harold McGee, who is esteemed as an authority on the science of food and cooking. He emailed me this simple and succinct solution to the vinaigrette puzzle: \"An emulsion is a combination of two liquids that can't mix evenly with each other, typically water and oil. One liquid is dispersed into the other in the form of separate droplets,\" He wrote. \"A vinaigrette is a suspension of vinegar droplets in oil, so yes, it's an emulsion.\" Case closed. Now, perhaps Stefan was thinking narrowly only of those emulsions that contain emulsifiers to stay together. As anyone who has made a basic vinaigrette knows, oil and vinegar will eventually separate into their original components (without more whisking). On the other hand, an emulsion like mayonnaise, which combines oil, lemon juice, and egg yolks, doesn't break down because of the presence of lecithin, an emulsifier, in the yolks. Similarly, adding some mustard to a vinaigrette will help to slow the separation of the oil and vinegar. So, Stefan was wrong. A vinaigrette is an emulsion. Images: Eater, flickr user DanielCK.

Well, to be -really- pedantic, a vinaigrette is only an emulsion if it's an emulsified vinaigrette. Sometimes vinaigrettes are \"broken\", which might be because a lot of time has passed since whisking, because the dressing hasn't been whisked properly, or because the cook has made a conscious decision to use a separated vinaigrette. Emulsified vinaigrettes are creamy and consistent in texture, broken ones have distinct oil and vinegar components.

Looking back from culinary school, we had many different emulsions that we made in class. One being a temporary i.e a vinegarette, short term, i.e. hollandaise and a more permenant, i.e. a mayonaise.

If I remember correctly from my culinary education, a suspension is different from an emulsion...
Michael
2008-11-18 12:11:37
I would have to say the difference is in the semantics. emulsion is a technical term meaning an emulsion which is a suspension of two liquids which cannot be combined and a vinaigrette which is a sauce/dressing which is made from 3 parts oil and 1 part vinegar traditionally. The former being preparational and the latter being constituential.  The guy on the show was an ass and trying as I am to sound smart ;)...

A vinaigrette that doesn't contain eggs, mustard or another ingredient to stabilize the mechanical emulsion is called an \"unstable\" emulsion.\" Mayonnaise, hollandaise etc are \"stable emulsions.\"

Ha! As I sat in front of my fireplace watching this episode I recalled fondly my days in the \"front of the house\" listening to the bickering of the chefs in the back. Whether a vinaigrette is a vinaigrette or a vinaigrette is an emulsion matter not - chefs will always find something to argue about. Because, like most creative directors (which I am in the field of advertising) it's rarely about the content and always about the battle.

EU Relaxes Rules on Imperfect Produce

***CONTENT
The EU has scrapped strict standards on the size and shape for 26 fruits and vegetables, paving the way for the sale of funny looking fruits and vegetables. The decision came despite protests from some nations which wanted to keep the rules for fear that produce prices would drop significantly. \"This is a happy day indeed for the curvy cucumber and the knobbly carrot, and other amusingly shaped fruits and vegetables,\" said European Commission spokesman Michael Mann. \"It's a concrete example of our drive to cut unnecessary red tape,\" added EU Agriculture Commissioner Mariann Fischer Boel. \"We simply don't need to regulate this sort of thing at EU level.\" She also noted that in a climate of high food prices and economic crises, \"consumers should be able to choose from the widest range of products possible. It makes no sense to throw perfectly good products away, just because they are the 'wrong' shape.\" Rules will be eliminated for apricots, artichokes, asparagus, aubergines, avocados, beans, Brussels sprouts, carrots, cauliflowers, cherries, courgettes, cucumbers, cultivated mushrooms, garlic, hazelnuts in shell, headed cabbage, leeks, melons, onions, peas, plums, ribbed celery, spinach, walnuts in shell, water melons, and chicory. However, as a compromise, standards remain in place for apples, citrus fruit, kiwi fruit, lettuces, peaches and nectarines, pears, strawberries, sweet peppers, table grapes and tomatoes.

The Brie Cheese Effect

***CONTENT
To explain the growth of the Himalayan mountains tens of millions of years ago, geologists turn to an unlikely analogy: oozing brie cheese. If the thick, firm mold on a wheel of brie represents the rocky surface of the high Tibetan Plateau, deep below the rock is more like soft cheese, capable of flowing under pressure or when heated (by the Earth's interior). \"It's like you put that into your microwave and turned it up just a bit,\" geologist Kip Hodges explained to National Geographic. \"It doesn't melt, but it begins to flow.\" The softer rock slowly oozes through the crust and onto the surface, adding new layers, and therefore new height, to the mountains.

Bioengineering students at Rice University are experimenting in making beer more like wine -- or, at least, channeling red wine's healthful properties into something sudsier. The objective is to take the yeast used to ferment beer and genetically engineer it to produce resveratrol, the compound in red wine that is believed to be beneficial for cardiac health and fighting cancer. Why beer? As reported on NPR, the students' ultimate goal is to bring the health benefits of wine to a much larger audience (beer consumption greatly outstrips consumption of wine). In order to brew their \"Biobeer,\" the students are introducing two genes found in grapes into a yeast strain provided by the Saint Arnold Brewery in Houston, Texas. According to the research project's web site, fermentation experiments are still ongoing. And, if you're not interested in drinking beer or wine to improve your health, future work will explore genetic engineering of yeasts to make other resveratrol-infused liquors like cider, whiskey, bourbon, and vodka.

Its great to hear that research going on making beer more like wine and bringing health benefits of wine to beer. Once it is done, I think this will drasticaly increase the consumption of beer.

Spoons, Knives, and Forks That Float

Shelterrific points to these innovative concepts for floating utensils: The ceramic forks, knives, and spoons are shaped with an empty ball in the center so that they will bob up and down rather than sinking to the bottom of your sink (and ending up in the garbage disposal). The gastronomic buoys might also make for an interesting way to serve food: I could imagine them floating in a container of just about anything brined or, perhaps, in a bowl of bocconcini chilled in water. The utensils' creator, Seongyong Lee, has also designed a plastic ladle that, like the forks and knives, floats upright. Both designs only appear to be concepts at this point, though a hypnotic video of the ladle in action is available on YouTube. Images: Seongyong Lee.

I know it was several weeks ago, but I see that you have a post related to your support for Obama.  Why are the comments closed for that post when you allow comments on other posts?  

If you want to somewhat alienate almost half of your readers (46% of the nation voted for McCain), then you should at least open it up for comments.  

Personally I read your blog for food information, but apparently you want to impart your political opinion as well (like so many celebrities).  I posted a similar comment on one of Adam Roberts' posts and it never made it through the moderation queue... interesting.  I wonder what my chances are of getting through here.

For Better Flavor, Lick Your Ice Cream

Does ice cream taste better licked from a cone or eaten with a spoon? An expert in food technology at Massey University in New Zealand recently weighed in on this critical issue: \"Flavor in ice cream is only released when the fat content – which carries the flavor – is warmed in the mouth to at least body temperature,\" said Kay McMath. \"During licking, the tongue is coated with a thin layer of ice-cream which is more quickly warmed and the flavor is detected by the large surface area of the taste buds present on the tongue.\" In comparison, a spoon provides some insulation to keep the sample colder when the ice cream enters the mouth. Once inside, the tongue pushes the ice cream to the roof of the mouth to melt before swallowing. This results in a smaller surface area on the tongue involved in warming the ice cream and releasing flavor. No word yet on how biting into an ice cream cone, our preferred method, affects flavor

I heard about this concept recently...licking ice cream produces a better flavor...so I had to try it out! I agree. Having the ice cream warmed by your mouth does give the ice cream more of a full flavor - so if you're spooning the ice cream - you can just hold it in your mouth a little longer!!

Wine Bottles Go on a Diet

***CONTENT
The Associated Press reports on a number of recent efforts by vintners to lighten their bottles in order to reduce shipping costs and lessen the environmental impact of wine distribution. California's Fetzer Vineyards, for example, is switching to a lighter-weight glass that makes bottles approximately 14 percent lighter -- a savings of 2,200 tons of glass annually. Most of the bottles lose the \"punt\" -- the indentation usually found on the bottom of a wine bottle. Despite the economic and environmental benefits of lighter packaging, there remains some resistance to the notion of leaving heavy bottles behind. \"If you've got a handmade boutique product, you have to have the right frame for it,\" winemaker John Bell tells the AP. \"Would you want to see a picture hanging on your wall with a cheap black, wood frame? Not if it's a Matisse.\"

Teeny Tiny Broccoli People, Part Deux

***CONTENT
We reported earlier on the oddities in Cascadian Farm's packaging design discovered by the bloggers at Bread & Honey. They found images of strange, tiny faces embedded in the tips of broccoli on boxes of Cascadian Farm broccoli florets. Here's a close-up, below. Well, it turns that there is even more to the story. Tipped off by one of their readers, the enterprising bloggers went back to the supermarket in search of more packaging quirks and found something very unusual on the labels of jars of Cascadian Farm concord grape jam. Looking very closely at the label's illustration of a pastoral farm setting, they saw that there were babies -- yes, babies -- in the hills! Below is a close up (and at top is an enlargement of one of the faces). When blogger Alicia Carrier contacted Small Planet Foods, the parent company of Cascadian Farm (owned by General Mills), she received this straightforward, yet puzzling, response claiming total awareness of the faces: \"The tradition of hiding names or faces on Cascadian Farm packaging began over a dozen years ago. It was unspoken tribute by the package design department to the friends & family of Cascadian Farm.\" Despite this homespun tradition at the company, Small Planet Foods promised that, \"The faces won’t be included on our redesigned packaging.\"

Coffee and Custard Polls Swing Towards Obama

***CONTENT
According to recent polls of registered voters, Senator Barack Obama appears to be solidifying an impressive lead over his rival, Senator John McCain. But, what about the coffee and custard vote? The results are still coming in, but there appears to be a strong turnout for Obama for patrons of 7-Eleven stores and the Culver's Custard ice cream chain. 7-Eleven's \"7-Election\" is tracking customers who chose a blue coffee cup for Obama vs. a red coffee cup for McCain. The latest results are a landslide for the Democrat: 60% for Obama and 40% for McCain. But, before Democrats get too giddy, bear in mind that the map (above) skews towards traditionally blue coastal states and leaves out much of the Mid-West and South. And while the numbers look very good for Obama, they most likely do not reflect one of Governor Sarah Palin's key consitituencies, \"Joe Sixpacks\" who would presumably be shopping at 7-Eleven for beer, not coffee. Culver's Custard has crowned \"Heath Toffeebits,\" the Democratic candidate, the winner of the \"popular vote\" in its \"Custard Election,\" with 51 percent of the 103,000 total votes cast online. In-store purcases of the two custards (so-called \"electoral college\") votes went to \"Reese E. Buttercup,\" the Republican sundae candidate, which out-sold the Democrat for a total of 53 percent of the 70,700 total votes. The map, detailing the distribution of online votes across (the heavily Mid-Western and Southern) states where Culver's operates, shows that the Democratic candidate made important inroads in battleground states Colorado and Michigan. Do these fake polls/publicity stunts tell us anything relevant about the real election? Probably not. But, then again, 7-Eleven customers did get the result right in 2000 and 2004.

Can you imagine the look on your child's face when she finds out that what looks like an ice cream cone is really Thomas Keller's signature cornet filled with raw salmon? Well, you may be able to redeem yourself this Halloween with Keller's bat-shaped sandwich cookies, recently featured at Savory Tidbits. The cookies are currently available for $3 each now through October 31 at Bouchon Bakery (Time Warner Center, Ten Columbus Circle, Third Floor). To make them yourself, just pick up some bat-shaped cookie cutters or other appropriately Halloween-themed shapes (the black cat and coffin would do nicely), and follow the recipe for Thomas Keller's \"TKO\" Oreo-style cookies.

The two food bloggers behind the cooking weblog Bread & Honey recently faced down a bag of frozen broccoli and discovered that the bag was staring back at them. Or, rather, tiny \"terrifying ecstatic faces\" were staring back, peering out from the images of broccoli florets on a bag of Cascadian Farms frozen broccoli. We hope that the minuscule green faces, which appear to grow right out of the tops of the broccoli, are just the work of a talented, but deranged photo editor. You will never look at broccoli the same way again. WTF, BROCCOLI? [Bread & Honey]

Dr Pepper Loses Bet With Guns N' Roses

In May, Dr Pepper challenged Guns N' Roses to release its famously delayed album \"Chinese Democracy\" during 2008. If the album was issued, the soda company promised it would give away a free can of Dr Pepper to \"everyone in America.\" Now that \"Chinese Democracy\" will officially be released at the end of November, Dr Pepper plans to make good on its bet with the rock band and give away soda by using coupons. It may turn out to be a brilliant marketing move, but it could cost Dr Pepper several million dollars, according to Ad Age, which put the total at $165 million in the extremely unlikely event that every American claimed his or her free can of soda.

On the heels of her PBS road trip through Spain with Mario Batali and Mark Bittman, Gwyneth Paltrow seems to be cementing her reputation as a gastrolebrity. Adopting the guise of a lifestyle guru, she is dispensing her thoughts on cooking (along with shopping, fashion, and other activities that \"nourish the inner aspect\") on her oddly-named new web venture, GOOP. So far, GOOP's main product is a weekly subscription-based email newsletter published in the mode of Daily Candy -- only here written in the first person and signed simply as \"Gwyneth.\" The first email dedicated to cooking shipped today, with healthy recipes for vegan pancakes (they look better than they sound), tuna sandwiches, soy/sesame mayonnaise, and caramelized black pepper chicken (courtesy of San Francisco's The Slanted Door). Overall, the food looks fine and the first-person instructions are straightforward, save for some chirpy aphorisms like \"Cook with love!\" and \"Make it Great!\" There's a plug for Jamie Oliver's cookware in the mix and this puzzling comment: \"[the chicken] is so easy and tastes like what you always imagine take-out will taste like (but sadly never does).\" And I always had such low expectations for take-out food.

Did you know that Anthony Bourdain has his own talk show? Apparently, it premiered earlier this week on the Travel Channel (if you saw it, let us know what you think). On the TV talk show scale, it appears to be less like Oprah and more like Charlie Rose, as \"Tony hosts a no-holds-barred dinner with four featured guests\" (the first episode included writer Bill Buford, nightlife impresario Amy Sacco, TV personality Ted Allen, and Maxim editor Chris Wilson. \"At the Table with Anthony Bourdain\" airs Mondays at 10 p.m. on the Travel Channel.

I saw it last night (I have all Anthony Bourdain stuff set to auto record) 

I'd say it's touching on something more like \"Dinner for Five with Jon Favreau\" http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0291604/

And actually I'd prefer if it were more like so, rather then having those brief moments where the guest is speaking post production. 

It is something that could work, if they could do a little more presentation on the local restaurant as well.

The usual anthony bourdain personnae is a lot more interesting than the show.   The topics were a little cliched and esoteric (is it wrong to spend $1800 on a meal?).  Also, in this particular episode, Amy Sacco came off as a boring idiot.
GL
2008-10-22 16:58:37
It worked for me.  However, I thought it was just a one-time thing.  I'm not sure how this stretches topic-wise to cover multiple shows unless there is enough topic-of-the-moments to discuss.  Otherwise, Bourdain as personna carried the show.

Agree on Sacco, though.  Could have done without her.

5 burnt out ex and current drug users talking about food like they are saving the world?  Please.  Bourdain used to be a cook and brought dignity to the craft.  Now he is a clown.  He is taking the whole \"I used to do drugs, swear a lot, and look how edgy I am\" personae too far. He will be begging the food network for a gig because his decline has started.

Agreed.  I love Bourdain and No Reservations, but it was honestly hard for me to watch this show.  It embarrassingly bad, and, right, so cliche.  Painful.  Dinner For Five was way more spontaneous and real and interesting.  Just let them all get really drunk and speak the truth.  And sadly, I agree with the person who said that Bourdain's badboy act is a little tired.  It is.  He's more like a privileged nerd now.  So it didn't play well at all.

I liked Kitchen Confidential, his mystery books are fine for light reading, and No Reservations is sometimes pretty interesting.  But...

this show was surprisingly dull.  As one commenter noted, the conversation was very contrived and the guests didn't seem to have anything interesting to say.

Tony - be a chef and cook something, or ben an author and write something.  Leave the talk show bit to John Steward and Conan O'Brien.

So,I'll be waiting for more traveling adventures with Tony.

A new report by Consumers International, a UK-based umbrella for consumer groups, has found that although cereal makers are reducing the amount of sugar in kids' cereals, they increase the amount of salt to improve flavor. According to Consumers International, \"manufacturers are likely to add salt to boost the flavor of the product, and may use salt to maintain customer appeal when sugar levels are reduced.\" In the study, a sampling of Kellogg's Frosties Reduced Sugar cereal was found to contain, on average, 1.5% salt, an amount that is larger than you would find in potato chips. Moreover, the reduced sugar cereal compared unfavorably to a sample of a full-sugar kids' cereal, Kellogg's Smacks, which averaged less than 1% salt.
