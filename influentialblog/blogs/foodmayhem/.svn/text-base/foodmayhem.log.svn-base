Cold Fighting Tea
CONTENT
Let’s be clear. I’m not dispensing medical advice here. I just have a killer cold and this is what I’m having right now and it’s pretty tasty (although I can’t taste that well right now) so I thought I’d share. It has a bunch of the commonly recommended cold fighting stuff: citrus for vitamin C, honey to boost immune system, ginger for virus fighting stuff, and black tea… I read that it does something like “speed the action of cilia, the tiny hairlike cells lining your nasal passages, helping them expel germs.”Cold Fighting TeaInstructions -1. In a small pot, bring water to a boil. Add ginger. Squeeze juice of lemon in and then drop the rind in. Add tea bag (tie string to pot handle). Stir in honey. Return to a simmer and cook for 3 minutes.2. Remove the tea bag and continue simmering for another 7 minutes. Strain into cup and enjoy.

so tasty. yet helpful. love it.bit of a heads up though, i reckon the honey should be mixed in afterwards when the tea has cooled down a bit. this is because hot water kills the enzymes in honey which ‘fights’ the cold.

I have often felt that having control over the ingredients that go into your sick body are infinitely more beneficial than any packaged relief. I love using fresh ginger too–there’s something so fresh and comforting about it! I second the honey added after boiling though. My mom always said honey is a finishing ingredient in cold-fighting recipes.

I second Hartley, cayenne is an essential element to the tea.  Also add the honey and lemon at the last moment.

The 90 year old Babushkas at church swear by a tea that’s similar… and I’ve learned to listen to them!  The only difference is- add a shot of vodka or whiskey.  Don’t drink it all at once, just sip it slowly until it cools down.
I’ve taught in elementary schools for the last 25 years, and suffered from bronchitis at least twice every year.  This is the FIRST non-prescription thing I’ve tried that had any effect.

Devil’s Food Cake with Matcha Green Tea Frosting
CONTENT
It’s my dad’s birthday and of course he gets a birthday cake. I love the pairing of chocolate and green tea. The flavors and colors seem mature, perfect for adults, although I bet kids would love it too. I used the 1942 Devil’s Food Cake Layers recipe from Nick Malgieri’s Perfect Cakes, but you can use any recipe that will give you two 9″ round layers. The Matcha Green Tea Frosting is the same one I used for the green tea cupcakes.I put one layer down and frosted it, while cutting the other layer with circle cutters (4.5″ and 3.25″). Ideally, the middle layer would be 6″ or 7″ but I didn’t have that size. One advantage to making cake this way is that you get to eat the scraps while you’re working hard.After it’s all frosted, I used some chocolate sprinkles to decorate the bottom layer, and piped around bottom edges. My dad’s name is Robert, in case you’re wondering about the “R”.

360 Cookware
CONTENT
Last week, Lon, Carol, and I headed over to the 360 Cookware Press Event, introducing this new line of pots by Americraft. It was your typical press event: fancy looking food and free flowing alcohol. We loved all the modern plastic bowls and plates. Presentation A+, but taste wise, ehh. None of us went back for seconds of anything.I generally only use non-stick for one thing, eggs. So I tried to cook some eggs, which made a really bizarre bubble as it cooked. It came out a bit over-cooked but I’m willing to say that was probably my fault since I’m not sure how to use this cookware. (The demo showed them putting the lid on and then spinning it to see when the “vapor seal” happens. ) But here’s the main problem, it left a layer of film (from the eggs) on my pot that I can’t get out. I tried boiling it in water, boiling with cream of tartar (a Carol trick), and just old fashioned scrubbing. It still looks like this:Now that my pot is ruined, I call Carol to find out how it’s going for her. She said she burned whatever she was makng (I can’t remember now) really badly. Ok, not looking good. While we’re on the phone, we agree that we’ll go watch the instructional video (even though we already watched the demo at the event) and hang up. I’ve been sick all weekend just wasting away on my couch and yet I haven’t been able to bring myself to watch the stupid video. I try to convince Lon to watch it with me and he refuses. So I call Carol again last night and ask if she has watched the video. Nope. Our verdict is, if you can’t get any one of us (three people who live to cook) to watch this video, you’re not going to get anyone else to watch it.So no go, I decided that’s the end of my patience for these pots. As far as I can tell, it doesn’t work. I believe they are also quite expensive, all over $100, and mine was ruined on the first shot.

I purchased some cookware similar to this a long time ago called LIFETIME. It should tell in your manual or the salesman should have told you to only use CAMEO or Bartender’s Friend as Blond Duck mentioned.
I never ever cook eggs in this type of cookware. I use Revere Ware for my eggs. I have a small one and a big one and the Teflon (or whatever they use) never scratches or comes off.
Have fun,
Susie in northern NY

Susie, I just looked at the lifetime website and they do seem quite similar. Ultimately, I’m not interested in any of this if it requires special cleaning methods. I have no problem with cleaning any of my other stuff (from cast iron to Le Creuset to an old wok to All Clad). I generally use teflon for eggs too.

Maduros con Queso
CONTENT
First things first, I whipped up a batch of delicious Salsa Verde and set it to the side.  Now on to the Maduros con Queso (for the non-Spanish reader: Sweet, Fried Plantains with Cheese).Maduros con Queso ~makes 8 three-inch piecesIngredientsInstructions1. Preheat about 1/4-inch deep worth of vegetable oil in a cast iron pan over medium-low heat.2. On a cutting board, smash garlic.  Coat the garlic with kosher salt.  Repeatedly press edge of knife against garlic and salt to create a garlic paste.  Add paste and plantains to a medium size bowl.  Mash plantains.3. Add fresh ground black pepper and potato starch to plantain mixture, combine thoroughly.4. Scoop about 1/8-th of the mixture into your hand and spread across fingers.  Place a piece of cheese in the center and coax the mixture to surround the cheese, it will likely be in a ball-like shape.  Add to the hot oil.  With a fish spatula, press lightly on the batter to flatten slightly, this will achieve more even cooking.5. Cook maduros about 60-90 seconds per side until slightly darker than golden brown; then flip and repeat.  Remove to paper towel to drain excee oil.  Serve hot with salsa verde.

How does this compare to Sophie’s Cubano?  That’s the gold standard for me.Also, I was speaking with a friend who owns a restaurant and he said coconut oil is incredibly healthy.  Does FM care to weigh in?
Lon

It’s actually not totally dissimilar to the Sophie’s sauce… which I agree, is absolutely awesome.  This will get you very close to the gold standard.Coconut oil has many health benefits and is one of the most common fats used worldwide.  However, it is a almost fully (90%) saturated fat, which is infamously linked to cardiovascular diseases and theories linking it to cancer.Knowing that, there are also some very good sides.  Due to the high saturated fat content, coconut oil is one of the most shelf-stable fats.  Kept in a cool, dry place, it can stay for 1.5 - 2 years.  Also, because of it’s chemical composition it is digested quite easily.  Supposedly it helps fights infection as well, but I can’t find any specific studies about that.By the way, here’s a post we did on how to extract the fat from coconuts.

Wu Liang Ye
CONTENT
When Lon’s ex-coworkers wanted to have Szechuan food, we took them to Wu Liang Ye (3 locations). The two Szechuan must-haves are Dan Dan Noodles and the Hot Oil Dumplings. The Dan Dan Noodles are covered in minced pork, scallions, and some spinach. The sauce is sweet, meaty, and moderately spicy.The Hot Oil Dumplings sit in a pool of sweet and spicy vinaigrette, topped with garlic cream. Stir it up before serving to everyone who’s willing to have garlic breath for the next 24 hours. I could eat several bowls of this by myself.Beyond that, we were open to suggestions, and our waiter was ready to fire away. I think we took all of his suggestions, and besides this Spicy Beef that was too sweet and too chewy, I was glad we ordered the rest.Their Crispy Whole Fish is a non-authentic dish but it’s still really good. They de-bone the entire fish, but put it back together before deep-frying it. That’s got to be a lot of work! It’s drenched in sweet and sour sauce with pine-nuts, corn, and peas, yet manages to stay crispy.Lon loves Camphor Tea Smoked Duck, but it’s so hard to find. It’s also a good dish to have since you’ll need at least one break from the spicy stuff.Our waiter kept raving about Streaky Pork (that’s what is written on the menu). We didn’t really know what he was talking about but said ok. It turns out, it’s sliced pork belly with hot green peppers and szechuan peppercorns. This was the spiciest dish.The Ma Po Tofu was also quite spicy, with minced pork and plenty of szechuan peppercorns. (This is different from my Ma Po Tofu which is more Taiwanese style.)I hadn’t been here in 2 years and while I really enjoyed the food, it seamed a little less authentic (more sugar, less spicy), which seams to be the trend these days. (You have to head to Flushing for the authentic Chinese food.) I’m not complaining though because at these prices (about $23 per person with tax and tip), this was a steal. We had some left-overs for lunch the next day too.

“Shezwan” chicken/ fish/ rice/ noodles are very popular in ‘Chinese Restaurants’ at Mumbai. This is very different from the Sichuan food that you have shown here.In Mumbai shezwan stands for a dish in a bright red colour, which is spicy and hot, and caters to the Indian palate

Lon
2009-05-02 21:15:00
Pearl - It can take 3-4 DAYS to prepare… It all depends on the preparation style.  The style we had was camphor tea smoked.  Camphor, a type of wood, can impart a very strong flavor, so that part is usually short (under an hour perhaps); but tea is quite light, so that may take more time.  Also, the process to get the skin crisp requires multiple cooling periods.  Here are two recipes: fast & slow.

I can’t speak to the flavor of the fish you ordered but I’m not sure where you come off calling that style of fish non-authentic.  Inauthentic to Sichuan?  Perhaps, but certainly not inauthentic when discussing the cuisine of Jiangsu province.  In fact a similar (if not exact same dish… sauce maybe a bit too brown) is the specialty of Suzhou and there is refered to as “Squirrel Shaped Mandarin Fish” due to its perceived resemblence to a squirrels tale.  I’ve had plates which mirror the picture above, down to the corn and peas.    Anyway, maybe hesitate before pontificating on authenticity in the future and educate yourself on the variety inherent to Chinese food.  Also, while the average place in Flushing has better Chinese food, it’s plain ignorant to say there’s not an occasional authentic gem in Manhattan.  Does something have to be in the Taiwanese style to make it authentic to you?
jessica
2009-05-06 17:54:00
Steve, hold your horses. You’re getting way to hyped up. I called that dish non-authentic because that’s what the waiter implied when he talked about the de-boning of it for Americans. In terms of the other dishes tasting not as authentic, it’s because it all got sweeter and less spicy.Towards the end of your comment there, you’re just starting to make lots of assumptions about me and/or what I said so, chill out.

Shanghai Square
CONTENT
While I am disclosing Jessica’s relationship with the owner, my review is not biased, I will maintain our usual critical style.Soup Bowls arrived next, set in pretty containers, topped, and piping hot.The Shanghainese Rice Cakes looked incredible when they arrived. Perfectly cooked rice cakes, peppered with a Chinese vegetable (of which we don’t know the name, but was something between Spinach and Kale), and sprinkled with shredded pork and bamboo. I loved the dish, and if I wasn’t stuffed, I could’ve eaten the whole plate. While I always enjoy rice cakes, the Spinach-like item took them to another level.A beautiful, conical pyramid of Pineapple & Shrimp Fried Rice showed up, and I could only muster the stomach space to eat one spoonful. It was very good, but I just couldn’t get any more down. There were cubes of pineapple that gave off a distinct sweetness. It matched the light fried taste of the shrimp and well-cooked rice.The last dish was a circle of Turnip Pastry around bright green broccoli, that we joked was shaped like green brains. We knew we’d be full, but ordered the pastry anyway, because they are outstanding! It’s really hard to find these anywhere in the city and they alone are worth the trip. It’s basically shredded daikon with bits of ham in a super flaky pastry wrapper. The description doesn’t remotely do justice to the taste. You have to just try it.

Cold Fighting Tea
CONTENT
Let’s be clear. I’m not dispensing medical advice here. I just have a killer cold and this is what I’m having right now and it’s pretty tasty (although I can’t taste that well right now) so I thought I’d share. It has a bunch of the commonly recommended cold fighting stuff: citrus for vitamin C, honey to boost immune system, ginger for virus fighting stuff, and black tea… I read that it does something like “speed the action of cilia, the tiny hairlike cells lining your nasal passages, helping them expel germs.”Cold Fighting TeaInstructions -1. In a small pot, bring water to a boil. Add ginger. Squeeze juice of lemon in and then drop the rind in. Add tea bag (tie string to pot handle). Stir in honey. Return to a simmer and cook for 3 minutes.2. Remove the tea bag and continue simmering for another 7 minutes. Strain into cup and enjoy.

so tasty. yet helpful. love it.bit of a heads up though, i reckon the honey should be mixed in afterwards when the tea has cooled down a bit. this is because hot water kills the enzymes in honey which ‘fights’ the cold.

I have often felt that having control over the ingredients that go into your sick body are infinitely more beneficial than any packaged relief. I love using fresh ginger too–there’s something so fresh and comforting about it! I second the honey added after boiling though. My mom always said honey is a finishing ingredient in cold-fighting recipes.

I second Hartley, cayenne is an essential element to the tea.  Also add the honey and lemon at the last moment.

The 90 year old Babushkas at church swear by a tea that’s similar… and I’ve learned to listen to them!  The only difference is- add a shot of vodka or whiskey.  Don’t drink it all at once, just sip it slowly until it cools down.
I’ve taught in elementary schools for the last 25 years, and suffered from bronchitis at least twice every year.  This is the FIRST non-prescription thing I’ve tried that had any effect.

Devil’s Food Cake with Matcha Green Tea Frosting
CONTENT
It’s my dad’s birthday and of course he gets a birthday cake. I love the pairing of chocolate and green tea. The flavors and colors seem mature, perfect for adults, although I bet kids would love it too. I used the 1942 Devil’s Food Cake Layers recipe from Nick Malgieri’s Perfect Cakes, but you can use any recipe that will give you two 9″ round layers. The Matcha Green Tea Frosting is the same one I used for the green tea cupcakes.I put one layer down and frosted it, while cutting the other layer with circle cutters (4.5″ and 3.25″). Ideally, the middle layer would be 6″ or 7″ but I didn’t have that size. One advantage to making cake this way is that you get to eat the scraps while you’re working hard.After it’s all frosted, I used some chocolate sprinkles to decorate the bottom layer, and piped around bottom edges. My dad’s name is Robert, in case you’re wondering about the “R”.

360 Cookware
CONTENT
Last week, Lon, Carol, and I headed over to the 360 Cookware Press Event, introducing this new line of pots by Americraft. It was your typical press event: fancy looking food and free flowing alcohol. We loved all the modern plastic bowls and plates. Presentation A+, but taste wise, ehh. None of us went back for seconds of anything.I generally only use non-stick for one thing, eggs. So I tried to cook some eggs, which made a really bizarre bubble as it cooked. It came out a bit over-cooked but I’m willing to say that was probably my fault since I’m not sure how to use this cookware. (The demo showed them putting the lid on and then spinning it to see when the “vapor seal” happens. ) But here’s the main problem, it left a layer of film (from the eggs) on my pot that I can’t get out. I tried boiling it in water, boiling with cream of tartar (a Carol trick), and just old fashioned scrubbing. It still looks like this:Now that my pot is ruined, I call Carol to find out how it’s going for her. She said she burned whatever she was makng (I can’t remember now) really badly. Ok, not looking good. While we’re on the phone, we agree that we’ll go watch the instructional video (even though we already watched the demo at the event) and hang up. I’ve been sick all weekend just wasting away on my couch and yet I haven’t been able to bring myself to watch the stupid video. I try to convince Lon to watch it with me and he refuses. So I call Carol again last night and ask if she has watched the video. Nope. Our verdict is, if you can’t get any one of us (three people who live to cook) to watch this video, you’re not going to get anyone else to watch it.So no go, I decided that’s the end of my patience for these pots. As far as I can tell, it doesn’t work. I believe they are also quite expensive, all over $100, and mine was ruined on the first shot.

I purchased some cookware similar to this a long time ago called LIFETIME. It should tell in your manual or the salesman should have told you to only use CAMEO or Bartender’s Friend as Blond Duck mentioned.
I never ever cook eggs in this type of cookware. I use Revere Ware for my eggs. I have a small one and a big one and the Teflon (or whatever they use) never scratches or comes off.
Have fun,
Susie in northern NY

Susie, I just looked at the lifetime website and they do seem quite similar. Ultimately, I’m not interested in any of this if it requires special cleaning methods. I have no problem with cleaning any of my other stuff (from cast iron to Le Creuset to an old wok to All Clad). I generally use teflon for eggs too.

Maduros con Queso
CONTENT
First things first, I whipped up a batch of delicious Salsa Verde and set it to the side.  Now on to the Maduros con Queso (for the non-Spanish reader: Sweet, Fried Plantains with Cheese).Maduros con Queso ~makes 8 three-inch piecesIngredientsInstructions1. Preheat about 1/4-inch deep worth of vegetable oil in a cast iron pan over medium-low heat.2. On a cutting board, smash garlic.  Coat the garlic with kosher salt.  Repeatedly press edge of knife against garlic and salt to create a garlic paste.  Add paste and plantains to a medium size bowl.  Mash plantains.3. Add fresh ground black pepper and potato starch to plantain mixture, combine thoroughly.4. Scoop about 1/8-th of the mixture into your hand and spread across fingers.  Place a piece of cheese in the center and coax the mixture to surround the cheese, it will likely be in a ball-like shape.  Add to the hot oil.  With a fish spatula, press lightly on the batter to flatten slightly, this will achieve more even cooking.5. Cook maduros about 60-90 seconds per side until slightly darker than golden brown; then flip and repeat.  Remove to paper towel to drain excee oil.  Serve hot with salsa verde.

How does this compare to Sophie’s Cubano?  That’s the gold standard for me.Also, I was speaking with a friend who owns a restaurant and he said coconut oil is incredibly healthy.  Does FM care to weigh in?
Lon

It’s actually not totally dissimilar to the Sophie’s sauce… which I agree, is absolutely awesome.  This will get you very close to the gold standard.Coconut oil has many health benefits and is one of the most common fats used worldwide.  However, it is a almost fully (90%) saturated fat, which is infamously linked to cardiovascular diseases and theories linking it to cancer.Knowing that, there are also some very good sides.  Due to the high saturated fat content, coconut oil is one of the most shelf-stable fats.  Kept in a cool, dry place, it can stay for 1.5 - 2 years.  Also, because of it’s chemical composition it is digested quite easily.  Supposedly it helps fights infection as well, but I can’t find any specific studies about that.By the way, here’s a post we did on how to extract the fat from coconuts.

Wu Liang Ye
CONTENT
When Lon’s ex-coworkers wanted to have Szechuan food, we took them to Wu Liang Ye (3 locations). The two Szechuan must-haves are Dan Dan Noodles and the Hot Oil Dumplings. The Dan Dan Noodles are covered in minced pork, scallions, and some spinach. The sauce is sweet, meaty, and moderately spicy.The Hot Oil Dumplings sit in a pool of sweet and spicy vinaigrette, topped with garlic cream. Stir it up before serving to everyone who’s willing to have garlic breath for the next 24 hours. I could eat several bowls of this by myself.Beyond that, we were open to suggestions, and our waiter was ready to fire away. I think we took all of his suggestions, and besides this Spicy Beef that was too sweet and too chewy, I was glad we ordered the rest.Their Crispy Whole Fish is a non-authentic dish but it’s still really good. They de-bone the entire fish, but put it back together before deep-frying it. That’s got to be a lot of work! It’s drenched in sweet and sour sauce with pine-nuts, corn, and peas, yet manages to stay crispy.Lon loves Camphor Tea Smoked Duck, but it’s so hard to find. It’s also a good dish to have since you’ll need at least one break from the spicy stuff.Our waiter kept raving about Streaky Pork (that’s what is written on the menu). We didn’t really know what he was talking about but said ok. It turns out, it’s sliced pork belly with hot green peppers and szechuan peppercorns. This was the spiciest dish.The Ma Po Tofu was also quite spicy, with minced pork and plenty of szechuan peppercorns. (This is different from my Ma Po Tofu which is more Taiwanese style.)I hadn’t been here in 2 years and while I really enjoyed the food, it seamed a little less authentic (more sugar, less spicy), which seams to be the trend these days. (You have to head to Flushing for the authentic Chinese food.) I’m not complaining though because at these prices (about $23 per person with tax and tip), this was a steal. We had some left-overs for lunch the next day too.

“Shezwan” chicken/ fish/ rice/ noodles are very popular in ‘Chinese Restaurants’ at Mumbai. This is very different from the Sichuan food that you have shown here.In Mumbai shezwan stands for a dish in a bright red colour, which is spicy and hot, and caters to the Indian palate

Lon
2009-05-02 21:15:00
Pearl - It can take 3-4 DAYS to prepare… It all depends on the preparation style.  The style we had was camphor tea smoked.  Camphor, a type of wood, can impart a very strong flavor, so that part is usually short (under an hour perhaps); but tea is quite light, so that may take more time.  Also, the process to get the skin crisp requires multiple cooling periods.  Here are two recipes: fast & slow.

I can’t speak to the flavor of the fish you ordered but I’m not sure where you come off calling that style of fish non-authentic.  Inauthentic to Sichuan?  Perhaps, but certainly not inauthentic when discussing the cuisine of Jiangsu province.  In fact a similar (if not exact same dish… sauce maybe a bit too brown) is the specialty of Suzhou and there is refered to as “Squirrel Shaped Mandarin Fish” due to its perceived resemblence to a squirrels tale.  I’ve had plates which mirror the picture above, down to the corn and peas.    Anyway, maybe hesitate before pontificating on authenticity in the future and educate yourself on the variety inherent to Chinese food.  Also, while the average place in Flushing has better Chinese food, it’s plain ignorant to say there’s not an occasional authentic gem in Manhattan.  Does something have to be in the Taiwanese style to make it authentic to you?
jessica
2009-05-06 17:54:00
Steve, hold your horses. You’re getting way to hyped up. I called that dish non-authentic because that’s what the waiter implied when he talked about the de-boning of it for Americans. In terms of the other dishes tasting not as authentic, it’s because it all got sweeter and less spicy.Towards the end of your comment there, you’re just starting to make lots of assumptions about me and/or what I said so, chill out.

Shanghai Square
CONTENT
It wasn't too long ago that the old-Lemongrass location on 13th Street was replaced by a Chinese restaurant called Shanghai Square Shanghai Square.  Jessica and I basically ignored it because their menu contained various Asian cuisines and we assumed it would be bad.  Later we found out that Jessica knew the owner, blasts from her past life as a professional figure skater.  She learned that the chefs were good (well the Chinese side, they also have chefs for the Pan-Asian stuff and that's pretty generic). Back to the Chinese  head chef, he came from well-known restaurant, Shun Lee Palace.  Plus they make dim sum all day (I know!), and sold at good prices, which is awesome for Union Square.  So we were hooked. It's way nicer than going to dirty Chinatown.While I am disclosing Jessica's relationship with the owner, my review is not biased, I will maintain our usual critical style.It was Jessica's dad's birthday and we pre-ordered a Chinese Banquet (some of these dishes are not on their regular menu).  However, since Sophia was with us, and most of the dishes were not vegetarian, she picked one extra dish off the menu -- and she picked well!The Sizzling Nugget, despite it's weird name, was delicious!  It's basically fried gluten with string beans, snow peas, red onions, and mushrooms, in a rich brown sauce.  It's super flavorful, and while Sophia picked out the mushrooms, she ate a huge amount of the rest, topping white rice with the great sauce.Of the banquet, seafood dishes came first, which is the norm.  The first dish was Dungeoness Crab in Black Bean Sauce.  It was some of the meatiest Dungeoness Crab we've had and the black bean sauce had an incredible flavor.  I felt like it offered that umame that was perfect with the light crab taste.  Possibly it was because of the black bean or because of the generous portion of the ground pork topping.The Grand Marnier Shrimp, generally one of our favorites during banquet dining, was not as enjoyable as at other restaurants like ... in Flushing.  A few reasons why: first, the shrimp were butterflied open and fried.  This made them a bit harder to eat and they were a bit over-cooked.  The bigger problem was that the mayonnaise sauce was a bit wetter than usual, a bit eggier than usual (maybe it was the Japanese-style mayo?), and there was just so much sauce.  Jessica noted that good taste of orange from the Grand Marnier, it was subtle but there.The first non-seafood dish to arrive was Peking Duck.  They arrived pre-wrapped in a very tight, cigar-like bundles.  The duck was shredded into very small pieces and they seemed to have been pre-set, so they dried out a bit.  Frankly, none of us were impressed with the dish.  For real duck, I'll stick to Peking Duck House or ... in Forest Hills.Soup Bowls arrived next, set in pretty containers, topped, and piping hot.It was a Ham and Winter Melon Soup.  They did a beautiful job!  The chefs delicately inserted pork into wedges of winter melon.  This was so enjoyable!  Winter melon is hit or miss but this made it a hit!  The broth was flavorful and warm.  This is a great cold weather soup.Most of us were feeling stuffed by the time a Whole Steamed Fish arrived.  Jessica doesn't know the English name for this fish, but it was great.  There was a small part of the fish that was under-cooked, but it didn't matter since the bulk of it was perfect and incredibly tasty, plus we were so full.  The slaw of ginger, carrots, and scallions seemed better than any other I'd had and the sauce was light but flavorful.  The fish meat was so tender and paired with the slaw to provide the right taste.The Tong Pau Pork, a pork belly slice that is prepared in a similar style to red braising, was next.  I was almost ready to ask another table to come sit with us to help us eat.  The pieces were cut generously per person and had a lot of flavor.  The fatty/best part on top was perfect, but Justin and I felt the meaty part on the bottom was closer to roasted pork than braised.  I certainly had no problem devouring it.Also devoured was the delicous spinach served with it.  I ate three helpings.Finally a vegetarian dish for Sophia!  She was stuffed from eating the Sizzling Nuggets, but ate a bit of the Bok Choy.  Since this sauce was corn starch based (my least favorite), and I was getting full, I passed.  Jessica and Kelly literally raved about the black mushrooms.  An exact quote: \"These are the best!\"The Shanghainese Rice Cakes looked incredible when they arrived. Perfectly cooked rice cakes, peppered with a Chinese vegetable (of which we don't know the name, but was something between Spinach and Kale), and sprinkled with shredded pork and bamboo. I loved the dish, and if I wasn't stuffed, I could've eaten the whole plate. While I always enjoy rice cakes, the Spinach-like item took them to another level.A beautiful, conical pyramid of Pineapple & Shrimp Fried Rice showed up, and I could only muster the stomach space to eat one spoonful. It was very good, but I just couldn't get any more down. There were cubes of pineapple that gave off a distinct sweetness. It matched the light fried taste of the shrimp and well-cooked rice.The last dish was a circle of Turnip Pastry around bright green broccoli, that we joked was shaped like green brains. We knew we'd be full, but ordered the pastry anyway, because they are outstanding! It's really hard to find these anywhere in the city and they alone are worth the trip. It's basically shredded daikon with bits of ham in a super flaky pastry wrapper. The description doesn't remotely do justice to the taste. You have to just try it.Well, I think it's clear that we ate way too much.  Plus, we took plenty of food home. Considering these portions at roughly $39 (including tax and tip) per person, it's an unbelievable deal. I've now eaten there several times (usually eating dim sum and The Whole Fish Casserole), and I'm sure I'll be back many times.  I hope to see you there.

Cold Fighting Tea
CONTENT
Let's be clear. I'm not dispensing medical advice here. I just have a killer cold and this is what I'm having right now and it's pretty tasty (although I can't taste that well right now) so I thought I'd share. It has a bunch of the commonly recommended cold fighting stuff: citrus for vitamin C, honey to boost immune system, ginger for virus fighting stuff, and black tea... I read that it does something like \"speed the action of cilia, the tiny hairlike cells lining your nasal passages, helping them expel germs.\"Cold Fighting TeaInstructions -1. In a small pot, bring water to a boil. Add ginger. Squeeze juice of lemon in and then drop the rind in. Add tea bag (tie string to pot handle). Stir in honey. Return to a simmer and cook for 3 minutes.2. Remove the tea bag and continue simmering for another 7 minutes. Strain into cup and enjoy.

Cayenne pepper is another great addition to at-home cold remedies - I use that along with honey and lemon in this recipe for  Cold Fighting Tea.

so tasty. yet helpful. love it.bit of a heads up though, i reckon the honey should be mixed in afterwards when the tea has cooled down a bit. this is because hot water kills the enzymes in honey which 'fights' the cold.

I have often felt that having control over the ingredients that go into your sick body are infinitely more beneficial than any packaged relief. I love using fresh ginger too-there's something so fresh and comforting about it! I second the honey added after boiling though. My mom always said honey is a finishing ingredient in cold-fighting recipes.

I second Hartley, cayenne is an essential element to the tea.  Also add the honey and lemon at the last moment.

The 90 year old Babushkas at church swear by a tea that's similar... and I've learned to listen to them!  The only difference is- add a shot of vodka or whiskey.  Don't drink it all at once, just sip it slowly until it cools down.
I've taught in elementary schools for the last 25 years, and suffered from bronchitis at least twice every year.  This is the FIRST non-prescription thing I've tried that had any effect.

Devil's Food Cake with Matcha Green Tea Frosting
CONTENT
It's my dad's birthday and of course he gets a birthday cake. I love the pairing of chocolate and green tea. The flavors and colors seem mature, perfect for adults, although I bet kids would love it too. I used the 1942 Devil's Food Cake Layers recipe from Nick Malgieri's Perfect Cakes, but you can use any recipe that will give you two 9″ round layers. The Matcha Green Tea Frosting is the same one I used for the green tea cupcakes.I put one layer down and frosted it, while cutting the other layer with circle cutters (4.5″ and 3.25″). Ideally, the middle layer would be 6″ or 7″ but I didn't have that size. One advantage to making cake this way is that you get to eat the scraps while you're working hard.After it's all frosted, I used some chocolate sprinkles to decorate the bottom layer, and piped around bottom edges. My dad's name is Robert, in case you're wondering about the \"R\".

360 Cookware
CONTENT
Last week, Lon, Carol, and I headed over to the 360 Cookware Press Event, introducing this new line of pots by Americraft. It was your typical press event: fancy looking food and free flowing alcohol. We loved all the modern plastic bowls and plates. Presentation A+, but taste wise, ehh. None of us went back for seconds of anything.They hired two chefs to demo the cookware and the schtick is this new cookware they developed acts like non-stick (you don't need to use oil or butter) because it uses the natural \"vapors\" from the food. The benefit being that this does not have the harmful chemicals of the tephlon, you don't have to use cooking spray, and it was supposedly super easy to clean no matter what you did to it.  On our way out, we each received our own 1 quart pot to try out and of course, we were eager to find out if this pot really worked.I generally only use non-stick for one thing, eggs. So I tried to cook some eggs, which made a really bizarre bubble as it cooked. It came out a bit over-cooked but I'm willing to say that was probably my fault since I'm not sure how to use this cookware. (The demo showed them putting the lid on and then spinning it to see when the \"vapor seal\" happens. ) But here's the main problem, it left a layer of film (from the eggs) on my pot that I can't get out. I tried boiling it in water, boiling with cream of tartar (a Carol trick), and just old fashioned scrubbing. It still looks like this:Now that my pot is ruined, I call Carol to find out how it's going for her. She said she burned whatever she was makng (I can't remember now) really badly. Ok, not looking good. While we're on the phone, we agree that we'll go watch the instructional video (even though we already watched the demo at the event) and hang up. I've been sick all weekend just wasting away on my couch and yet I haven't been able to bring myself to watch the stupid video. I try to convince Lon to watch it with me and he refuses. So I call Carol again last night and ask if she has watched the video. Nope. Our verdict is, if you can't get any one of us (three people who live to cook) to watch this video, you're not going to get anyone else to watch it.So no go, I decided that's the end of my patience for these pots. As far as I can tell, it doesn't work. I believe they are also quite expensive, all over $100, and mine was ruined on the first shot.

I purchased some cookware similar to this a long time ago called LIFETIME. It should tell in your manual or the salesman should have told you to only use CAMEO or Bartender's Friend as Blond Duck mentioned.
I never ever cook eggs in this type of cookware. I use Revere Ware for my eggs. I have a small one and a big one and the Teflon (or whatever they use) never scratches or comes off.
Have fun,
Susie in northern NY

Susie, I just looked at the lifetime website and they do seem quite similar. Ultimately, I'm not interested in any of this if it requires special cleaning methods. I have no problem with cleaning any of my other stuff (from cast iron to Le Creuset to an old wok to All Clad). I generally use teflon for eggs too.

Maduros con Queso
CONTENT
We've had some plantains ripening on our counter for quite a while.  One of them turned as black as our granite.  We simply had to use them... poor us, forced to eat sweet, delicious plantains.  I was just going to slice them up and fry them into maduros -- it wouldn't be the first time.  Jessica had a far better idea, stuff them with cheese.  Oh boy, yes.First things first, I whipped up a batch of delicious Salsa Verde and set it to the side.  Now on to the Maduros con Queso (for the non-Spanish reader: Sweet, Fried Plantains with Cheese).Maduros con Queso ~makes 8 three-inch piecesIngredientsInstructions1. Preheat about 1/4-inch deep worth of vegetable oil in a cast iron pan over medium-low heat.2. On a cutting board, smash garlic.  Coat the garlic with kosher salt.  Repeatedly press edge of knife against garlic and salt to create a garlic paste.  Add paste and plantains to a medium size bowl.  Mash plantains.3. Add fresh ground black pepper and potato starch to plantain mixture, combine thoroughly.4. Scoop about 1/8-th of the mixture into your hand and spread across fingers.  Place a piece of cheese in the center and coax the mixture to surround the cheese, it will likely be in a ball-like shape.  Add to the hot oil.  With a fish spatula, press lightly on the batter to flatten slightly, this will achieve more even cooking.5. Cook maduros about 60-90 seconds per side until slightly darker than golden brown; then flip and repeat.  Remove to paper towel to drain excee oil.  Serve hot with salsa verde.

How does this compare to Sophie's Cubano?  That's the gold standard for me.Also, I was speaking with a friend who owns a restaurant and he said coconut oil is incredibly healthy.  Does FM care to weigh in?
Lon

It's actually not totally dissimilar to the Sophie's sauce... which I agree, is absolutely awesome.  This will get you very close to the gold standard.Coconut oil has many health benefits and is one of the most common fats used worldwide.  However, it is a almost fully (90%) saturated fat, which is infamously linked to cardiovascular diseases and theories linking it to cancer.Knowing that, there are also some very good sides.  Due to the high saturated fat content, coconut oil is one of the most shelf-stable fats.  Kept in a cool, dry place, it can stay for 1.5 - 2 years.  Also, because of it's chemical composition it is digested quite easily.  Supposedly it helps fights infection as well, but I can't find any specific studies about that.By the way, here's a post we did on how to extract the fat from coconuts.

Wu Liang Ye
CONTENT
When Lon's ex-coworkers wanted to have Szechuan food, we took them to Wu Liang Ye (3 locations). The two Szechuan must-haves are Dan Dan Noodles and the Hot Oil Dumplings. The Dan Dan Noodles are covered in minced pork, scallions, and some spinach. The sauce is sweet, meaty, and moderately spicy.The Hot Oil Dumplings sit in a pool of sweet and spicy vinaigrette, topped with garlic cream. Stir it up before serving to everyone who's willing to have garlic breath for the next 24 hours. I could eat several bowls of this by myself.Beyond that, we were open to suggestions, and our waiter was ready to fire away. I think we took all of his suggestions, and besides this Spicy Beef that was too sweet and too chewy, I was glad we ordered the rest.Their Crispy Whole Fish is a non-authentic dish but it's still really good. They de-bone the entire fish, but put it back together before deep-frying it. That's got to be a lot of work! It's drenched in sweet and sour sauce with pine-nuts, corn, and peas, yet manages to stay crispy.Lon loves Camphor Tea Smoked Duck, but it's so hard to find. It's also a good dish to have since you'll need at least one break from the spicy stuff.Our waiter kept raving about Streaky Pork (that's what is written on the menu). We didn't really know what he was talking about but said ok. It turns out, it's sliced pork belly with hot green peppers and szechuan peppercorns. This was the spiciest dish.The Ma Po Tofu was also quite spicy, with minced pork and plenty of szechuan peppercorns. (This is different from my Ma Po Tofu which is more Taiwanese style.)I hadn't been here in 2 years and while I really enjoyed the food, it seamed a little less authentic (more sugar, less spicy), which seams to be the trend these days. (You have to head to Flushing for the authentic Chinese food.) I'm not complaining though because at these prices (about $23 per person with tax and tip), this was a steal. We had some left-overs for lunch the next day too.

"Shezwan" chicken/ fish/ rice/ noodles are very popular in 'Chinese Restaurants' at Mumbai. This is very different from the Sichuan food that you have shown here.In Mumbai shezwan stands for a dish in a bright red colour, which is spicy and hot, and caters to the Indian palate

Lon

Pearl - It can take 3-4 DAYS to prepare... It all depends on the preparation style.  The style we had was camphor tea smoked.  Camphor, a type of wood, can impart a very strong flavor, so that part is usually short (under an hour perhaps); but tea is quite light, so that may take more time.  Also, the process to get the skin crisp requires multiple cooling periods.  Here are two recipes: fast & slow.

I can't speak to the flavor of the fish you ordered but I'm not sure where you come off calling that style of fish non-authentic.  Inauthentic to Sichuan?  Perhaps, but certainly not inauthentic when discussing the cuisine of Jiangsu province.  In fact a similar (if not exact same dish... sauce maybe a bit too brown) is the specialty of Suzhou and there is refered to as "Squirrel Shaped Mandarin Fish" due to its perceived resemblence to a squirrels tale.  I've had plates which mirror the picture above, down to the corn and peas.    Anyway, maybe hesitate before pontificating on authenticity in the future and educate yourself on the variety inherent to Chinese food.  Also, while the average place in Flushing has better Chinese food, it's plain ignorant to say there's not an occasional authentic gem in Manhattan.  Does something have to be in the Taiwanese style to make it authentic to you?

Steve, hold your horses. You're getting way to hyped up. I called that dish non-authentic because that's what the waiter implied when he talked about the de-boning of it for Americans. In terms of the other dishes tasting not as authentic, it's because it all got sweeter and less spicy.Towards the end of your comment there, you're just starting to make lots of assumptions about me and/or what I said so, chill out.

Pocket Full Of Nuts
CONTENT
I selfishly developed this recipe just for me. I love cream cheese doughs and I love nuts. I love desserts, but not too sweet, and cuteness is a definite plus. This recipe has it all and would be pure heaven with a good cup of coffee.Pocket Full of Nuts ~makes 24 pocketsInstructions -1. In a large bowl, mix together flour and salt. Cut butter and cream cheese into flour with a pastry cutter, until course crumbles form. Using your hands, pack together until it forms one rectangular block. Wrap in plastic wrap and chill for at least 1 hour. You can chill over-night, but will need to let it soften a bit before you can roll it.2. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. In a medium sized bowl, mix together nuts, sugar, heavy cream, and almond extract. Set aside.3. Roll out dough to 1/8″ thick on a lightly floured surface. Using a ruler, carefully cut 2.5″ squares. Place 1 teaspoon (only!) of nut mixture in the center of each square.4. Bring the 4 points together and very lightly pinch together edges (don't force it to seal). Place on ungreased baking sheets, 1″ apart. Brush with egg wash.5. Bake for 12-14 minutes, or until golden brown. Cool on baking sheets for 10 minutes. Remove to wire racks to finish cooling.

Francisco's Centro Vasco Francisco's Centro Vasco is a Lobster place and that is what you should eat there. You don't need to do any picking other than the size of lobster you want to eat. They have sizes from 1 1/4 lb to about 9 lbs regularly. Bigger ones vary on availability but they sometimes have lobsters that weigh over 25 lbs.The meal is a full package already. As soon as you sit, you'll get salad, a touch vinegary but very good amongst the world of included salads. The bread could be better. It's like standard supermarket level stuff.You then choose, rice, baked potato, or fried potatoes. Since Carol has been there before, she recommended the fried potatoes and this is definitely the one you should choose. It's a cross between french fries and chips, yes, pure crispy heaven! They weren't seasoned at all so you'll need to throw on salt yourself.You also get a plate of steamed green beans with garlic.Carol ordered a 1 1/4 lb lobster, steamed.Lon and I split a 4 lb lobster, broiled with bread crumbs. They do a nice job with it, perfectly cooked, and bread crumbs are mixed with the roe and tomalley.Check out the difference in claw sizes between the 4lb and the 1 1/4 lb.We also ordered some Clams Oreganata, but you can skip these.The flan is pretty standard and the cappuccino is weak but pretty.Service and decor are not exciting, but acceptable. The focus is lobster which they know how to cook properly and the prices are reasonable ($142 including tax and tip for all three of us). I'm dying to try a 20+ lb lobster so I left my number and asked them to call me when they get one.

Just an FYI....The larger lobsters are very difficult to cook properly.  Because of their age,  they have extremely hard and thick shells,  causing the cooks to have to overcook them to ensure that they are done. In addition,  because the shells are so thick,  the carryover heat can overcook them on the way to the table. One more thing to burst your bubble,  the yield also changes in that big of a lobster, so you would be paying an exorbitant amount for less lobster. I've run several seafood restaurants where we served lobster,  and anytime we cooked something over 5 lbs,  we were disappointed!! All that being said,  a 20 plus pounder is a ridiculous sight to see,  and would look really cool on the table at a restaurant!!!

Meyerboy -- I hear ya.  I've once dined on a 17′ish pound lobster that was fantastic.  Perhaps we just got lucky and they cooked it perfectly, but it was amazing.  The shell was really thick, but it tasted amazing.

Chicken Caesar Salad
CONTENT
I've always loved Caesar Salad but I haven't ordered it in restaurants for years. Often, it ends up tasting like a heavy gloppy ranch or just creamy parmesan dressing. Caesar dressing should have anchovies in it yet often, it seems like it's been left out.The craving hit before lunch yesterday so I asked Lon to whip up a Caesar for me. He found a Tyler Florence Recipe (with anchovies of course) and while the dressing had a wonderful freshness to it, we still couldn't really taste the anchovies. Our recommendation: kick up the anchovies.We grilled up some chicken breasts sprinkled with sumac, toasted some pita and rubbed it with garlic, and the weather was perfect for lunch outside.

Daydream
CONTENT
This frozen yogurt fad has some confused, with the more recent ones tasting more tangy like yogurt, while old-school frozen yogurt tasted more like ice cream. Amongst friends the votes are divided as to which they prefer, so it seems like a good idea for Daydream Daydream to offer both, Original-Creamy and Original-Icy. Lon prefers creamy but they were out of it, so he went for the Cookies and Cream, which ended up being so-so. I sampled the pomegranate which was a little too tart, so I got Original-Icy, which is good, but I still prefer the in-between tart and creamy of Flurt. (I hope that didn't just confuse you more.)Where Daydream stands out is their toppings. They have these fruit dusts (Lon got strawberry, I got blackberry) that are super cool and make the yogurts really pretty. The strawberry was a lot stronger than the blackberry; and I can't wait to try other ones. Lon also got chocolate covered pretzels that gave his cup a nice salty sweet combo.Prices seem comparable to all the others but this place feels just a tad more classy. It might be the plastic spoons that look like silverware, or really, I think I'm just in love with the fruit dusts.

This is an incredibly well designed pizza box concept, that according to the video, is now patented.  Environmentally Conscious Organization, Inc. (ECO), right out of our hometown, NYC has created a normal-sized pizza box made out of 100% recycled materials.  But who cares about that...Much cooler is the fact that the top of the pizza box tears off and becomes four serving plates.  The bottom of the box, also more than meets the eye, folds over and becomes a storage container for left-overs, looking much like the pizza box we saw in Mexico.It's a cool idea, we wish the company good luck!

Gottino
CONTENT
I had a really great time at Gottino Gottino Monday night, partly because my friend Bianca is great company, and partly because I think I was drunk. This rarely happens to me, but the waiter allowed me to taste 4 different white wines before I chose one, and then gave me a very generous glass. The first was too sour, the second was bitter, the third had something to it that reminded me of pool water (I know that's really bizarre). I chose a Grillo by Tenuta di Serramarracco, moderately fruity and a little sour by itself, but paired wonderfully with the fatty foods we ordered.The menu is full of little plates, the way I enjoy eating most. Our waiter recommended two crostini. We both loved the Sheep's Milk Ricotta and Fava Beans. I'm not usually a ricotta fan but there was something about this very fresh and lightly creamy ricotta than made a perfect pillow for the roughly mashed fava beans, full of herbs and well seasoned. This is a  must when you go. The other, Pesto di Noci, described as a walnut pesto is so much more than that. It's a mound of moist walnut that looks like little pebbles, flavored with parmesan and thyme. You have to be a nut lover for this and when I split some onto another piece of bread, I loved it and gobbled it up. I don't think Bianca was as in to it though.We both enjoyed the Coppa Dell'Aia, a Guinea hen, quail, and capon terrine. The cornichons were too salty and not sour, but it's a small detail on this plate. The Chicken Liver Pate and the Baccala, both served in cute little mason jars, but didn't appeal to either of us as much. Ironically, these came in overly generous portions.The La Tur has a wonderful texture, soft and smooth, with a very mild flavor. It's a good beginner cheese to keep in mind. They plated it with a little quince paste. I really enjoyed the simple Radicchio Salad with pine nuts, currants, and goat cheese. It was perfectly refreshing.We ended with Flor di Latte, sweet milk gelato, sourced from somewhere in Pennsylvania (unfortunately, I can't remember where). It was quite good.With tax and tip, we each paid about $48, reasonable considering we could have ordered a bit less. I would go again, and because I forgot my camera, I'll conveniently use that as an excuse for my return.

Croutons are most commonly flavored with parmesan and oregano, but in this heat, I wanted something lighter. These are made with some citrus and fresh dill, resulting in a very distinctive crouton that really brightens an ordinary salad.Summer Croutons ~6 servingsInstructionsPreheat oven to 350 degrees F. Toss together all of the ingredients right in the baking dish. Bake for 15-20 minutes, or until browned and dry, stirring occasionally. Cool and throw on top of salad.

Beater Blade Plus
CONTENT
A few weeks back I came across a product review for Beater Blade Plus by New Metro Design, on some invention news website.  The idea seemed like one that I've had for a while -- extend the blade attachment for the KitchenAid mixer to reach the bottom and walls of the bowl.  Pretty simple.The review said it worked, and it was only $30 on Amazon.  We use our mixer a lot and if it could help even a bit, it was worth it.It arrived a few days later and we immediately put it to the test.  We made both a Red Velvet Cake and a Buttermilk Cake with it.  Wow, we love it!  You still need to scrape down the bowl once or so, but the batters and frostings combine much faster and much better.  And definitely less scraping required.We just wonder why KitchenAid never thought to make this themselves!  It's available for just about every KitchenAid model, plus Viking and DeLonghi as well.  If you use your mixer, you need this!

I bought one for my ancient KitchenAid a few months back and all I could say was "wow."  Yes, mouth agape, "wow."  I had just purchased a Cuisinart because my KitchenAid has a 4.5 qt bowl and I wanted a larger bowl but was afraid to upgrade to the 6.0 qt because of all the bad reviews.
After trying the Beater Blade I contacted the company to see if they made one for Cuisinart.  They do but only for the 7.0 qt bowl not the 5.5 which I had purchased.  I begged, I pleaded but to no avail, so... I sent it back (the Cuisinart), no matter the more spacious bowl, which really was wonderful, but - I'm not scraping any more stinking stand mixer bowls.  No, nay, never no more!
People they make these things for all sizes of the KitchenAids, the larger Cuisinart and, as stated above Viking (7.0 qt) and DeLonghi.  BUY ONE!!!

Pukk
CONTENT
As Jessica, Sophia, Justin and I walked to Pukk Pukk to meet Lily and Steve, we kept cracking jokes about the name.  Were we going to be ill?  Would the food taste like hockey sports equipment?  We realized that the name is likely a reference to Phuket, Thailand (often spelled Pukket), from where the cuisine is inspired (I'd guess the name is pronounced \"pook\".  But still, laughs abounded.Pukk's motto is \"eat more greens\" and their food is vegetarian Thai.  The menu is filled with dishes that include duck, chicken, and steak.  But they are all the soy-fake-meat versions.  I don't mind fake meat, what I mind is that they call it duck, chicken, etc.  Find a different name.  They taste good, but taste nothing like the real thing.  Moving on.As is often the case, the appetizers were better than the entrees; and we tasted most of the menu.The Chicken Nuggets were fried soy chicken balls with a sweet chili sauce. This was Pukk meets McDonald's (across the street and up a block). While the plump, soy chicken was a bit rubbery, the outside was superbly crispy and the sauce with essentially Thai ketchup. These are addicting, I popped almost half a plate myself. Everyone (except me) agreed these were the second best appetizer... I thought they were the best! We had two plates worth.Everyone's favorite (and my second favorite) was a daily special: the Minimalist Dumplings. These philosophical treats were something like less-fried versions of samosas: fried dumplings with chives, corn, crispy noodles, and mixed greens in massaman sauce. Again, we went back for more and had two plates worth.The Spicy Spring Rolls were very good as well. Fried wraps of vermicelli noodle, onion, basil, and mushroom with pineapple sauce. They had a little heat that was perfectly offset by the sweet sauce. Our only thought was that there should have been more sauce.The Curry Thai Pancakes were quite nice. The pancakes were reminiscent of Chinese Scallion Pancakes, without the scallions. The sauce was something like green curry / massaman curry with little soy croutons in it to add some body. There was way more sauce than necessary, so we held on to it and used it later for rice and other dishes. We really liked it.The Soft Green Rice Crepes were ok, but not quite as exciting as the other apps. The flavor was good, but the ketchup-based fish sauce substitute was overpowering. If the dish had 75% less sauce, we would've liked this one. The soft crepe was perfect over the plentiful filling of soy chicken, radish, and peanuts.Overall our least favorite was the Indy Roll. It wasn't bad, per se, but just boring. Cucumber, soy duck, noodle with custard tamarind sauce and spicy yellow mustard... but not balanced and no clear point.As if eight appetizers weren't enough to start, we also ordered a Papaya Salad. It wasn't as spicy as some similar salads I've had, but it had a decent sauce and the papaya and carrots were finely shaved. Nothing special here either.Our favorite entree was one of the first to hit the table. This might be a good point to note that the service was quite good. Everything came fast and our requests for this or that were quickly serviced. Back to the Spicy Corn Noodle. Everyone at the table raved about how the broad rice noodle was cooked perfectly. It was soft and had just the lightest al dente bite to it. The dish itself had broccoli, corn, tomato, with chili basil sauce and had a nice flavor, but wasn't over powering.The Spicy Eggplant and Tofu was rockin'! The tofu was thinly sliced and fried crisp. The eggplant was nice and saucy without being oily. The onions, basil, and spicy garlic sauce were delicious.The Duck Basil was interesting, but sort of a miss. The soy duck pieces were small and crisp, however, I thought they had an off, grill taste, something like a gassy, propane flavor. Combined with onions, bell peppers, and chili-basil sauce, it was a decent dish.The Market Rice was nothing special, it wasn't bad, just bland.The Yellow Curry Fried Rice was more of a let down, mostly because I had higher hopes. It was just as bland as the Market Rice, but at least it was architected.The Gravy Noodles were pretty lousy. Skip this one if you go. They have no taste and are soupy.Another special for the day was the Emerald Spaghetti. It was such a weird combination of marinated soy chicken breast, avocado, bamboo shoots, basil, bell pepper in green curry. Steve joked that it was California Thai fusion. The avocado had some weird seasoning, but, honestly, by the end of the meal, we were so full it didn't matter much.Overall we give Pukk two thumbs up. It's small and uncomfortable inside (seriously, the green chairs are insanely narrow and the rubber mats will make your butt fall asleep). The decor is hideous, we all felt like we were eating in someone's bathroom. But the prices are very good ($4 per app and $7-9 for entrees). And the food, well, if six people clearing 15 dishes doesn't speak for itself, I'm not sure what will. If you're in the neighborhood, give it a shot.

I love that they offer meat alternatives. It's always so hard to find a restaurant that reinvents a meat eater's experience, but it's too bad they misrepresented it as actual meat! The Thai pancake and sauce reminds me of how quesadillas are often served with chowders or thick soups.

Top Chef 6: Las Vegas!
CONTENT
The rumors have been confirmed by Kate Aurthur of the LA Times (via Yumsugar), that the next season will be shot in Las Vegas.  Filming begins next week.In my mind, Vegas is a great place for the show, seeing as how it is THE Mecca of celebrity chefs looking to extend their culinary reach.  I'm just hoping against hope that the Vegas magicians can make Toby Young disappear.

Stogo
CONTENT
Last night, we were walking home when we saw Stogo Stogo. Lon and I walk into just about any new food place we see, so in we went to sample what they call Gourmet Organic Dairy-Free Ice Cream. I was hoping it would be good since Lon is lactose intolerant, but after we each tried three flavors, hope was lost and we went on our merry way. So, some of their stuff is made with coconut milk and the rest is soy. It just doesn't taste anything like ice cream so perhaps if they called it something else, you'd have different expectations, but even still, I don't think I'd eat it.Lon related it to eating something like frozen halvah and it did have that sort of mouthfeel. The moral of the story is, don't mess with ice cream. It's got to have dairy in it.

Deb's Catering
CONTENT
In celebration of this gorgeous summer weather, we met up with Justin and Sophia for lunch in Hudson River Park. We picked up some lunch at Deb's Catering Deb's Catering, which had received a great review from Eric Asimov in the New York Times, calling it \"The hottest lunch in New York\". I've long stopped reading the New York Times reviews, and I'm I'm not going to start now, because the four of us were not impressed.First off,service was weird.  It was close to 1pm and they didn't have much ready. Sandwiches (not made to order) were just coming in. We couldn't do much customizing. We asked for provolone on a Philly Cheese Steak and when we got to the park, it was American, and otherwise, very average.They asked if we wanted french fries. We said yes, and then they said oops, no one turned on the fryer, how about home fries. Ok. We can usually be pretty agreeable since we eat everything and when I'm trying a place for the first time, I'm willing to try anything they think is good. Well, the potatoes were fine but not notable.The roast beef sandwich was under-seasoned, but Lon liked the foccacia roll. I didn't like the tasteless mozzarella used in Sophia's sandwich, but the pesto was very fresh.I scooped up a variety of salads at $9.95 per pound. They were all fresh and tasty, but way too expensive at that price.Overall, nothing was bad and the ingredients were fresh, similar to any other \"gourmet\" sandwich and salads shop, but \"hottest lunch in New York\" is a far stretch. Be carfeful when you throw around words like that Eric. People (me) will stop believing you.

Megan, well hopefully we'll continue to grow and if we ever make money, we can cover more area.Pearl and Abby, I do prefer yelp because reviews are written without outside influences (or at least less), but I still take it with a grain of salt. Some people's honest opinion is still useless because often people just have bad taste.

New Croque-Monsieur: Gruyere and Smoked Ham on Challah French Toast
CONTENT
You voted for it and here we have it, the New Croque-Monsieur, FoodMayhem style. In preparation for our super awesome Grilled Cheese, Lon made mustard, and I made Challah (Peter Reinhart's recipe). The Challah should be made and sliced the day before so that it can stale. (Don't worry, I ate plenty of it fresh that day too. )New Croque-Monsieur ~Serves 4Instructions -1. In a pan or dish large enough to hold all the bread in one layer, whisk together eggs, buttermilk, sugar, and salt. Lay the Challah flat in the pan. Let it sit for 30 minutes. Turn it over and let is sit for another 30 minutes.2. Melt 1/2 tablespoon butter on medium low heat, on a cast iron skillet. Place two pies of challah on the skillet. (The side you cook first will end up being the inside of the sandwich. )3. When the challah is golden on one side, flip one piece over. Spread 1 tablespoon of mustard on. Sprinkle 2 ounces of gruyere. Lay on ham. Sprinkle with black pepper. Place the other piece of challah on top, uncooked side facing up.4. When the bottom is golden, flip entire sandwich over to finish the last side. When the last side is golden, remove from heat and cut in half.5. Repeat with the remaining ingredients to make another large sandwich (again cutting in half to make two).

I wanted to add in a comment or two just about the taste of this sandwich.  It was ridiculously good.  Jessica and I sat around moaning about the flavor.  It is a bit sweet from the french toast and the mustard, a bit salty from the gruyere and ham, a bit tangy from the mustard and the pepper,  it's rich from the ham and the egg, and each bite melts in your mouth from the challah and the cheese.Oh man, seriously, it has everything.  This has got to be the winningest Grilled Cheese sandwich for Grilled Cheese month.

In the picture above, here's what we bought:Sound like a lot of stuff?  It is! (don't ask us where we plan to keep it all).  Price tag?  $83.00.  Insane.  Cheap!  I've never seen decent quality flatware for under a dollar per.The clerk told us the sale would last until inventory was gone, this is all surplus.  I highly recommend you run, don't walk, to the store and clean house.  In addition to flatware and stemware, they also have ceramics, and other goodies for under $5.

Interview with Michael Klug
CONTENT
Chef Michael KlugHaving fallen head over heels in love with the chocolates from L.A. Burdick, we were dying to know more about Pastry and Chocolate Chef Michael Klug. Amidst the busy Mother's Day crunch, he was still kind enough to share some great insights about himself and chocolate.FoodMayhem (FM): You have worked at some fancy restaurants (Lespinasse and Chanterelle to name a few), some of the biggest names in the world.  What drove your decision to switch from big city Pastry Chef to chocolatier of a smaller company?Chef Michael Klug (MK): Before I came to Burdick chocolate I was working my entire career in restaurant and hotel business establishments; and yes some of these where among the finest in the industry during this time. During my years at Lespinasse with Chef Gray Kunz we were always on the search on the best ingredients and products. In the summer of '93 Kunz approached me if I would consider to actually purchase chocolates for our petit four assortments. Not that we didn’t like what we were making at Lespinasse, but Kunz thought a chocolate company had the better set up and efficiency to make a superior confection than a restaurant. And to his opinion L.A. Burdick was the highest standard of chocolate quality that he could find. After I tasted the chocolate for the first time I had to agree with him. From that time on we received Burdick chocolates every week fresh from Walpole, New Hampshire.When Larry Burdick approached me in the summer of 2002 to become the head chocolatier of his company I felt honored and excited. In addition, my son was just three months old and a move to the country from the big city seemed like a good idea.FM: We have tasted your chocolates and there is no doubt that they are distinctive.  We’re impressed by how, in a highly saturated market, your chocolates do indeed stand out.  Tell us your secret: what makes your confections so much better?MK: I again feel very much honored that you enjoy our chocolates so much. We constantly strike for quality and freshness. There are a lot of chocolate confections on the retail market that allow their product to have a shelf life of 3-4 weeks and up to 2-3 months. We strictly recommend to consume our chocolates within 10 days of purchase. We don’t believe in preservatives; we only use fresh local cream, purest ingredients, very expensive and high quality couvertures. We use old world techniques in the making of our bonbons, methods that are traditionally used in Switzerland and France. We do not use chocolate molds to shape our bonbons. This technique allows a very thin chocolate coating and provides a nicer mouth feel. In addition, the thinner coating does not mask the delicate flavor of our interior ganache.Another very important point when we create our chocolates is not to overpower the chocolate in our ganache with the flavor ingredient that is added. For example:A cherry bonbon should taste first of chocolate and have the cherry flavor as a subtle complex addition. It’s like a well balanced wine.We also like to find a natural way of garnishing our chocolates, so that they are elegant but don’t look pretentious or out of touch with what their made of.FM: Not only do your treats taste wonderful, they look beautiful -- you are an artist.  Where do you find your inspiration and how often do you release new items?MK: As I mentioned in question No.2 we like to garnish our chocolates with great attention to detail and simplicity. The inspiration comes often from within. I personally do not search the food world constantly and look what other pastry chefs create. Working with food for over 23 years someone develops a certain style. When I came to Burdick chocolate I had to adapt my style to the product that already existed. But as a pastry chef in the restaurant world I always had to do that. Desserts had to look that they came from the same kitchen where the food was cooked. Within these boundaries it was always interesting to keep a style that you would be able to identify yourself with. The same it is for me at Burdick chocolate. I think of a new product, usually during jogging or something where I have a little distance to the day to day routines, and then we often start as a team to work on it and make it a Burdick product. The little chocolate gateaux’s that I’m sending you are our latest creation. We designed them special for the upcoming Mother’s Day holiday.There is no specific rhythm for new product releases. It’s not like a restaurant that changes it’s menu every season, but some products are created for specific holidays.FM: You’ve worked at amazing restaurants; we assume you’ve eaten at amazing restaurants.  What are a few of your favorite restaurants in the US?MK: I have to say that outside of New York City I did not have the pleasure to dine at many restaurants. Being a native German I mostly went back to Europe for travel, often also family related. But in New York City I had excellent meals at Annisa, Café Boulud, Danube, Chanterelle and Jean-Georges.FM: Excluding your own chocolates, what’s your favorite dessert?MK: Besides our chocolate bonbons and assortments I’m also very fond of seasonal fruit-oriented desserts. My favorite part during my time as a pastry chef in the restaurant world was the specific arrival of certain products during their annual season. Like Quince in the fall, Rhubarb in the spring, or Peaches in the summer, and then create a dessert that was totally different than something that I did the year before. But in general, I really love desserts that are light, fruit-oriented and well balanced in sugar/acidity ratio. Desserts that are simply sweet and rich are more a turn off for me.But if I have to name one dessert on the top of my head I would say \"Rhubarb Strudel with Vanilla Sauce and Cinnamon Ice Cream”.FM: Many readers want to start making chocolates at home, can you provide some tips?MK: It is interesting that you are asking that question, since I asked that question myself in the summer of 2006. I was wondering if people would like to come to Walpole, NH and visit our chocolate factory for a workshop to learn more about chocolate. Since there is such a big selection on various pastry – and cooking workshops, the idea of the Burdick chocolate cooking school was born. We advertised for the summer of 2007 and sold out in the first year.Chocolate is very complex and not easy to work with. A lot of details in the process of working with chocolate have to be executed precisely; otherwise there is no success in the final product.I think it is very difficult giving a few tips about working with chocolate in a small interview.But the right book about chocolate can help a long way. I recommend two books that are very thorough and well written:1. Peter P. Greweling “Chocolates & Confections” 2. Jean Pierre Wybauw “Fine Chocolates: Great experience”These books will cover a lot of ground and will help to get someone started and cover basics as well as advanced fancy work.FM: For us, food is life… love… religion even.  Where is your food Mecca?  Where do you travel to for food?MK: At this moment I travel a lot to New York City, since New Hampshire is a very sparse food scene and I end up cooking truffle and fois gras dinners at home.But if I would have to mention one place than it would be the small town of ‘Baiersbronn” in Germany’s Black Forest. It features two 3 Star Michelin Restaurants(“Schwarzwaldstube” in Hotel Traube Tonbach; “Bareiss” in Hotel Bareiss) and another 1 star Michelin restaurant called “Sackmann”. Not many people know that outside of France, Germany has the largest number of 3 Star Michelin restaurants; 9 total. And this little romantic town in the Black Forest is my most favorite food place to visit.Since it is remotely located, the food and the luxury accommodations of the hotels are definitely my food mecca. FM: When you’re not making pastries and chocolates, what are your favorite past times?MK: Besides chocolates and pastries my favorite past time are fine wines; I think there are more flavor sensations and complexity to discover in fine wines that there are in food.But you might want to say “has this guy anything else on his mind than eating and drinking?”Well, I love to go fly fishing, jogging, play chess and work on a little theater group that I just started.FM: While you’re sharing, would you be willing to share a recipe with FoodMayhem readers?MK: Yes I would share a recipe with FoodMayhem. Would it be ok to publish the truffle recipe that I did at the architectural design show?L.A. Burdick's Framboise TrufflesIngredientsInstructions1. Chop the dark chocolate into small pieces and place in mixing bowl or food blender. Place glucose, honey, heavy cream and pinch of salt in a sauce pot and bring to a boil; Let cream mixture steep for about 15 minutes.2. Reheat cream until scalding, but not boiling. Pour over the chopped chocolate. Whisk until smooth. Add soft butter and Framboise Eau de Vie and mix again. 3. Line a cutting board with plastic wrap. Pour the ganache evenly over the wrap and cover with another sheet of wrap. Roll ganache evenly with a rolling pin, while both ends of the pin are resting on an exact height support. This could be a frame, two books or magazines of same height. The purpose is to determine the desired height of the chocolate interior. The ganache should rest for about 36 hours, but no longer than 72 hours in a cool, but dry place before further handling.4. After resting, the ganache should be cut with a knife into even small pieces. These pieces will get rolled into small round truffle shaped bonbons. 5. Start melting dark chocolate in an oven with a pilot light or indirectly over a water bath, while you are rolling the truffles. It is important that the melting of the chocolate is done gently and not too hot, since chocolate can be scorched if it is heated higher than 130 deg F. Milk and white chocolate are even more sensitive and should not heat over 120 F.6. We like to roll our truffles with a chocolate that is within a range of 94-99 F. Coat each truffle with a thin layer of chocolate and let rest in a cool area for about ½ hour. Than repeat the coating with another thin layer and place truffle in cocoa powder. Lightly roll the truffles in cocoa powder with a truffle fork. Let truffles rest for another 2 hours in a cool and dry area. 7. Remove the truffles from cocoa powder and with a pastry brush, remove excess cocoa.

Sushi Yasuda #28
CONTENT
It's been way too long since our last visit to Sushi Yasuda. Between our busy schedule and the difficulty of getting reservations with Chef Tomura, we've gone nearly three months without it. Tragic, I know! But all good things come to those who wait, right? Well, in this case, we did get two new stellar pieces, not to mention, it's Soft Shell Crab season (yay!).So Sorry about the pics. I don't know why they came out so terribly, but this is Torigai, in the clam family. It tastes like ultra tenderized octopus, with the sweet eel sauce brushed on. We both liked it.The other new piece was Kisu, related to white fish. I'm normally not a fan of this group but this mellow fish had a bit more texture than most, being a very small fish. It was also very pretty but again, sorry for the picture (on the right).This time, we made sure to make our next reservation before leaving so we'll be back in 2 weeks.

two weeks for a reservation? that's intense!
the most "authentic," deemed "best" japanese/sushi restaurant in san diego is sushi ota.. and it requires you to always get a reservation in order to eat there, unless you want to show up 30 minutes prior to opening and wait in line.  but i don't think it requires 2 weeks for a reservation!

In any case,  enjoy both, while I sit and pout, awaiting your return.

TITLE
Bourdain: Walking on Waters
CONTENT
I've been wanting to add a section on food news, stuff about celebrity chefs and food fame, but I'm way not cool enough. So to ensure the kind of quality you've grown to expect from FoodMayhem, we've added a new writer, Sheng C, who is cool enough. He's a \"taste bud\" (a friend who's taste we trust) and we are so excited to have a new dimension on our site. Enjoy, mangia, and let us know what you think!- Forward by JessicaIn March, Waters was profiled on 60 Minutes, where she was portrayed as a “steamroller” who played a critical role in bringing the locavore movement to the level of popularity that it has reached today. She also has made substantial progress in improving the quality of food in schools by incorporating the development of edible gardens into the curriculum of Berkeley’s public schools, and she was one of the first people to dream up the idea of an organic edible garden at the White House, which the Obamas recently installed, as an example of healthful eating for Americans.As outspoken as she has been on these issues, it’s natural for her to have some enemies. One of them is none other than Mr. No Reservations himself, Anthony Bourdain. I stumbled across a DCist interview with Bourdain a few months ago, in which he goes on the offensive against Waters:\"I'll tell you. Alice Waters annoys the living [expletive] out of me. We're all in the middle of a recession, like we're all going to start buying expensive organic food and running to the green market. There's something very Khmer Rouge about Alice Waters that has become unrealistic. I mean I'm not crazy about our obsession with corn or ethanol and all that, but I'm a little uncomfortable with legislating good eating habits. I'm suspicious of orthodoxy, the kind of orthodoxy when it comes to what you put in your mouth. I'm a little reluctant to admit that maybe Americans are too stupid to figure out that the food we're eating is killing us. But I don't know if it's time to send out special squads to close all the McDonald's. My libertarian side is at odds with my revulsion at what we as a country have done to ourselves physically with what we've chosen to eat and our fast food culture. I'm really divided on that issue.\"After reading this, I too felt a bit divided. In one corner, you have Waters, who has done so much to improve the way we eat over the past quarter century. In the other, you have Bourdain, a personal food hero of mine, someone who is known to stir the pot with his acerbic, often irreverent commentary on food celebrities ranging from Rachel Ray to Emeril. He is probably right, in that if Alice Waters had her way entirely, her vision of a food utopia with everyone, rich or poor, eating organic, locally grown, sustainable meats and produce, with no McDonald’s in sight, is unrealistic and would probably be forced on many unwilling McDonald’s-loving Americans.On the other hand, considering the kind of uphill battle she is up against – enormous agro-businesses with huge amounts of lobbying power, factory farms still producing the bulk of our meats, and a recession that is making it difficult for even well-heeled families to make healthful, often pricier food purchases – it’s not likely that her food utopia will be realized any time soon. That being said, don’t we want someone like Waters to champion these values during these times? As she said in her 60 Minutes interview, when pressed on her being labeled as self-righteous or elitist, \"I feel that good food should be a right and not a privilege and it needs to be without pesticides and herbicides. And everybody deserves this food. And that's not elitist.\" As much as I respect and admire Bourdain for his thoughts on the food industry, in this case, I think he needs to realize that Waters’ “orthodoxy” is actually not a threat to his libertarian values, and we need more people like her to continue to push for a better way of eating for everyone. Your thoughts?

Bordain's just trying to get press by being a douche.  Waters is on track.  Many of her dishes are inexpensive - check her cookbooks.  And if we had a sane agricultural policy in this country, healthy & fresh food would be much cheaper and we wouldn't be subsidizing high fructose corn syrup. Truth is that food is a relatively small portion of most family budgets and the savings that could be achieved by eating healthily need to be factored into the cost (carrots cost more than Doritos, but diabetes and obesity cost society a lot too).  Score is Waters 1, Bordain 0.
Kara

I have some problems with Waters and I tend to agree with Bourdain.  Seriously, the woman who talks about local, sustainable, accessible food flew in chefs from all over the world, brought wine from California, and imported champagne from France?  So local East Coast wines weren't good enough for her Inaugural bash?  Let's talk about the carbon footprint of food from *that* perspective.The other problem that I have with her agenda is that while I *do* actually agree with much of what she says, how she says it is so off-putting that it makes people not want to listen. Whether she means to be or not, she sounds elitist, which isn't the way to bring people around to your point of view.  And the single parent who is struggling to make ends meet simply feels as though he or she is being talked down to for not buying organic, cooking at home, growing their own, etc., rather than being encouraged.

What a fantastic post.
Note that Bourdain did state that he was pretty divided on this issue.However, I think that as long as there are those who are love places like McDonalds and are willing to purchase meats from factory farms, then Waters' dream may never be realized; instead, organic food, healthy foods will still be looked as at a privilege or a sign that you've "made it," instead of a right for everyone.I think Bourdain may have felt that Waters' wanted to "force" her philosophy of food onto everyone else and ban all McDonalds, but instead, Waters feels that everyone should be entitled to foods that would not be considered a "status symbol."Overall, though, I support both chefs: Waters, of course, has the excellent idea that all should receive good food and Bourdain has maintained the philosophy that there should be an "open market" of choices.  It's a little like the national health care debate in the U.S. Both are fighting for what is, essentially, human rights - and it's difficult to choose one over the other.
Sheng
2009-04-24 09:16:00
I'm totally with you Bill G -- it is really important to factor in long-term costs from a health care standpoint.  Preventive medicine just doesn't get the credit that it deserves.Kara, I think your point that there is some room for improvement in Waters' practices is a good one, though I tend to cut her some slack because she has done other things to offset that carbon footprint.  For example, she was one of the first to bottle and carbonate water in-house at Chez Panisse.  For a restaurant that used to go through tens of thousands of bottles a year, that's a substantial reduction in carbon footprint.Pearl, Waters' dream may never be realized to its fullest, and, to be honest, I'm ok with that.  In a way, the uphill battle that Waters is waging is actually a good thing, a way of providing a checks-and-balances system to protect those libertarian values held by Bourdain and so many others, so that the country is not completely overrun with either McDonald's...or hippies preaching the gospel of heirloom tomatoes.

Mustard!
CONTENT
In preparation for our upcoming Grilled Cheese extravaganza, we need some awesome mustard.  As you may know from reading Jessica's bio, she loves mustard.  And at the moment we probably have six or eight different store-bought mustards at home.Nevertheless, when Bill talked about making his own mustard, we were inspired.  We ran to Kalustyan's and picked up some Yellow Mustard Seeds.  They came in a 4 oz. package, which was the perfect amount to make two different recipes.  Which worked out well, since I totally messed up one of them.  Fortunately, the easier of the two, came out well, and will be the one we use.This is super easy to make and super hard to wait to taste.Sweet & Spicy MustardIngredientsInstructions1. Add seeds, salt, marjoram, and red pepper to a spice grinder or small food processor.  Pulse until finely ground.2. In food processor, combine ground seed mixture, with sugar and turmeric, plus a drop of the vinegar.  While running, slowly drizzle vinegar until a coarse paste is achieved (use as needed).  Let stand 15 minutes, then remove to sterilized jars and refrigerate for at least one day before use.

L.A. Burdick Handmade Chocolates
CONTENT
We found L.A. Burdick Handmade Chocolates at the Dining by Design: Table Hop & Taste, and from then on, we've fallen deeper and deeper in love! You know how rarely we truly rave about products. We're a tough pair and it's hard to impress us, but these are damn good chocolates. So while we're finishing up the interview with Chef Michael Klug (coming very soon), we wanted to make sure we showed you some of their incredible Mother's Day chocolates in time for you to order, because we know you'll appreciate this.We got to try their two special Mother's Day gifts, beautifully boxed and bowed.Bee Rounds is an adorable package with little handmade bees with almond wings. My mom couldn't bare to eat the last bee, she loved it so much! The flavors in this box celebrate honey and roses without over-powering the chocolate.The Mother's Day Chocolate Gateaux is just insanely good. Looking at the flavors, like Strawberry Violet and Grand Marnier Pistachio, I was a bit wary. I'm usually a chocolate purest, my favorite being around 72% dark, and find that most flavorings just distract or hide the chocolate. Lon and I (and all the lucky people we shared with)  agreed that L.A. Burdick chocolates are the best in balance. The flavors really serve to enhance and each bite just makes you want to lay down and close your eyes to some soft music.My favorite was the Apricot Ginger in Dark Couverture. It deserves it's own picture...If not for Mother's Day, try one of their Assorted Wood Boxes. It's definitely an elegant looking gift if you can bare to give it away. (I really don't know if I can.)There was so many great flavors in there, nutty, fruity, creamy, extra dark...oh and cute mice...As I sat there, gorging to my delight, I decided that L.A.Burdick is my permanent chocolate company from now on. Besides being the best tasting chocolates, they're made fresh without any preservatives, and they have great prices. It's my favorite by far and I'm definitely joining their Connoisseur's Club (with very tasty benefits).Stay tuned for our interview with Chef Michael Klug.

Bodegas Dios Baco Oloroso Sherry
CONTENT
Chris happened to bring a bottle of sherry that perfectly matched our dessert.  He didn't know we were making Apricot Beignets, but he nailed the choice with an oloroso sherry from Bodegas Dios Baco, originating in Jerez, Spain.First, olorosos are a bit sweeter and less dry than other sherrys, that is perfect for our personal preference.  Second, due to those qualities it pairs perfectly with fatty foods like nuts, fois gras (for which it's known to pair with), and fried desserts.  Finally, its perfume is obvious-strong enough to hold up against the beignets, but not overwhelming.We all enjoyed this fortified wine and believe that the producer, who's name means (I think) Bacchus' Wine Cellar, truly has captured what the god of wine would like!

Apricot Beignets with White Chocolate Apricot Sauce
CONTENT
I found a recipe for Apricot Beignets and thought it looked great, except for the chocolate dipping sauce. Despite usually preferring dark chocolate, I just thought white chocolate was a much better fit for these beignets.The best part about this recipe is that you can make the batter before your guests arrive, and leave it in room temperature until you're ready to fry up dessert.Remy Apricot Beignets with White Chocolate Apricot SauceBeignetsWhite Chocolate Apricot SauceInstructions1. Bring apricots, 3 tablespoons water, 3 tablespoons sugar, and cognac to boil in medium saucepan, stirring until sugar dissolves. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer 2 minutes. Remove from heat. Steep, covered, 30 minutes. Drain; reserve apricots and syrup.2. Bring 1/2 cup water, milk, butter, and salt to boil in large saucepan over high heat, stirring until butter melts. Remove from heat. Add flour; stir briskly until dough gathers into ball. Place pan over medium heat; stir constantly until film forms on pan bottom, about 2 minutes. Cool 5 minutes. Using electric mixer, beat in eggs 1 at a time. Beat in apricots. DO AHEAD: Can be made 4 hours ahead. Cover; let stand at room temperature.3. Preheat oven to 200°F. Line large rimmed baking sheet with paper towels. Pour oil into large deep saucepan to depth of 1 1/2 inches. Attach deep-fry thermometer to side of pan; heat oil to 330°F to 340°F. Working in batches of 5 or 6, drop dough by rounded teaspoonfuls into hot oil. Cook beignets until golden brown, adjusting heat to maintain temperature and turning after 2 or 3 minutes, about 5 minutes Total. Using slotted spoon, transfer beignets to sheet. Place in oven to keep warm. (If you can multi-task, make the sauce in step 4 while you are frying batches.)4. Make Sauce: Bring heavy cream to a boil. Pour over white chocolate and stir until dissolved. Stir in reserved apricot liquid.5. Dust beignets with powdered sugar and serve with sauce.

Hebert's TurDucKen
CONTENT
Family friends, in from Texas, wanted to have some Turducken.  It was after Chris, their son, told them about how good it was, and their friends recommended Hebert's Specialty Meats.  The small (about 12 pounds) poultry item was shipped to Jessica's parents' home.  Unfortunately, due to some oven issues, we weren't able to make it yesterday, so everyone came to our place tonight to dine on the ungodly creation.For those of you not already in the know, this beast is created by deboning the core of a turkey, leaving only bones in the wings and legs.  A layer of stuffing is then applied to the opened bird.  A deboned duck is then layed atop the stuffing.  Usually, it is only the duck's breast meat.  More stuffing is applied, and finally a deboned chicken.  The whole thing is sewn back together in a Frankenstein-like manner.  Delicious debauchery.This was not the first time I've had Turducken.  Several years ago, I hosted a dinner party for when I ordered the same, from a different company, La Boucherie (which I prefered to Heberts, by the way).  Many people credit Cajun Chef Paul Prudhomme with the idea for the Turducken.  However, my mother, who I usually doubt, was able to prove otherwise.  She pulled out a copy of an Empire Kosher Poultry recipe book from a long time ago (I forget the date), which pre-dated Prudhomme's recipe, although it wasn't called Turducken.Anyway, it arrives frozen, and needs to thaw for 3 - 4 days.  It then bakes covered for about 3 hours, uncovered for 1 hour, and rests an hour.  What a fun feast, that feeds an army.

Wow, the first time I heard about Turducken was during an episode Ace of Cakes where they made a turducken cake for a boy's birthday. The idea fascinated me and seeing the real thing...intriguing, how do you debone the turkey while keeping it all together like that?
jessica
2009-04-25 23:39:00
Paula, I actually think the turkey meat gets a bit dry because it take a long time to cook something so big and dense. I think the concept is great but needs a little more work.Chantal, we didn't make this Turdukken, but the leg parts are not deboned, just the breast cavity.

Strawberry and Feta Salad
CONTENT
Have you had fresh strawberries with feta cheese before? If not, you're missing out on a great combination. Try throwing together this simple salad, some mixed greens, fresh sliced strawberries, crumbled feta, and drizzle with an aged balsamic vinegar and extra virgin olive oil. Don't forget to season with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper. It's beautiful and elegant, but simple and not too fussy, like the perfect black dress that can be dressy or casual.

Buttermilk Cake with Cream Cheese Frosting and Berries
CONTENT
We had to make a cake super fast yesterday. Luckily, we had left-over frosting from the Red Velvet Cake. I also wanted to use up the buttermilk (bought for the Red Velvet Cake), so a plan was born. I found a Nick Malgieri Recipe for Buttermilk Cake Layers. I would use the left-over frosting, and I'd throw in a strawberry and blueberry filling/topping of my own, to dress it up. It seamed like an easy plan in my head. Ok, so it turns out, it's not THAT easy, but it's not really hard either, just a few more steps... We were just in a real rush and had to throw it all together so fast that the frosting job wasn't gorgeous but it tastes REALLY good. It's now one of our favorites and will probably be frequently made as a birthday cake.Buttermilk Cake with Cream Cheese Frosting and BerriesButtermilk Cake Layersfrom Nick Malgieri's Perfect Cakes makes two 9-inch round layersIngredientsInstructions1. Line 2 (9″) cake pans with buttered parchment paper. Position rack in the middle of oven and preheat to 350 degrees F.2. Stir together the flour, baking soda, and salt in a bowl, mixing well.4. Reduce the speed to low and beat in one-third of the flour mixture, then half the uttermilk, stopping and scraping down the bowl and beater after each addition. Beat in another third of the flour, then the remaining buttermilk, stopping and scraping again. Finally, beat in the remaining flour mixture.5. Scrape the bowl well with a large rubber spatula. Pour the batter into the prepared pans and smooth the tops.Strawberry and Blueberry FillingIngredientsInstructions1. Place all the ingredients in a pot and heat on low until all the fruit has softened, stirring frequently. It will look soupy.2. Turn up to medium high heat and stir until thickened. Remove to bowl and set aside to cool.Cream Cheese Frosting - use half of this recipe.Assembly1. Place one cake layer down. Spread half of the berry mixture on top.2. Place the second cake layer on top.3. Cover with Cream Cheese Frosting. Pipe a rim around the edge (yea, bad rush job). Fill the center with the remaining berry mixture. Chill.Ta da! Yum!

Red Velvet Cake
CONTENT
I got all excited when I saw beet powder at Kalustyan's. My mind was buzzing, I was doing cartwheels (in my imagination)... I was going to make a red velvet cake I could eat (I'm allergic to artificial food coloring). Yipee!Uh no, with some quick research, I found this article, here's an exert:\"Food purists seeking to replicate the color, flavor and cooking method of a traditional red velvet cake by merely substituting natural food coloring for artificial colors will run into a series of obstacles. These occur because natural food dyes and pigments, like the pigment in beet powder, are sensitive to both heat and pH and change color when combined with baking soda or baking powder.\"Bummer...Mega Bummer!Rest assured, we will look into this some more, but this time, we needed a cake that day, so we pulled out a recipe Lon has used before from Cakeman Raven.  He is renowned for his authentic, Southern Red Velvet Cake.  The distinguishing factor is that his cake actually tastes like red velvet -- that is it has strong accents from the vinegar and buttermilk.  Red Velvet shouldn't just be coloured red, it should taste a certain way.This was a perfect choice for Sophia's birthday, she really wanted cream cheese frosting, and this has A LOT of it.Southern Red Velvet Cake Recipe adapted from Cakeman Raven, Cakeman Raven Confectionery, NYC ~makes 9-inch, three-tier cake.  8-12 Servings.Ingredients2. In a large bowl, sift together the flour, sugar, baking soda, salt, and cocoa powder. In a stand mixer, whisk together the oil, buttermilk, eggs, food coloring, vinegar, and vanilla until color is consistent.3. Mix the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients until just combined and a smooth batter is formed.4. Divide the cake batter evenly among the prepared cake pans. Place the pans in the oven evenly spaced apart. Bake, rotating the pans halfway through the cooking, until the cake pulls away from the side of the pans, and a toothpick inserted in the center of the cakes comes out clean, about 25-30 minutes.5. Remove the cakes from the oven and run a knife around the edges to loosen them from the sides of the pans. One at a time, invert the cakes onto a plate and then re-invert them onto a cooling rack, rounded-sides up. Let cool completely.6. Frost the cake. Place one layer, rounded-side down, in the middle of a rotating cake stand. Using a palette knife or offset spatula spread some of the cream cheese frosting over the top of the cake. (Spread enough frosting to make a 1/4 to 1/2-inch layer.) Carefully set another layer on top, rounded-side down, and repeat. Top with the remaining layer and cover the entire cake with the remaining frosting. Leaning the cake on its side, apply chocolate shavings to the edges.Cream Cheese Frosting makes enough to frost a 3 layer (9-inch) cakeIngredientsInstructions1. In a standing mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, or with a hand-held electric mixer in a large bowl, mix the cream cheese, sugar, and butter on low speed until incorporated. Increase the speed to high, and mix until light and fluffy, about five minutes. (Occasionally turn the mixer off, and scrape the down the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula.)2. Reduce the speed of the mixer to low. Add the vanilla, raise the speed to high and mix briefly until fluffy (scrape down the bowl occasionally). Store in the refrigerator until somewhat stiff, before using. May be stored in the refrigerator for three days.

I wonder if this post might help: http://www.bookofyum.com/blog/valentines-day-gluten-free-red-velvet-cupcake-recipe-with-no-food-coloring-2645.htmlThe history of red velvet cake sounds rather interesting, and I wonder about the validity of bakers using beets (the link mentions this also) if the color/taste/texture is altered significantly. I've sent an email to my librarian friend who specializes in food history (and is a trained pastry chef! pretty cool albeit eccentric, eh?) and I'll let you know what I find out! It would be a shame to miss out on such a tasty cake.

Sparks Steak House
CONTENT
As soon as you walk in to Sparks Steak House Sparks Steak House, you'll notice that they're very old school. It's a boys club here, where men out number women 4 to 1, every staff member is male, and there is a wall full of cigars. The feel is very, old mob movie-like and there is a huge crowd by the bar. Don't get excited ladies, these are mostly fat old men. The place is loud too; you might as well be in Chinatown. I don't know why people \"business dine\" here.While we ate the average rolls, we looked over the menu (thank you for large print) where nothing sounded interesting. There was no T-bone, no aged steaks, no rib-eye, hanger, or porter house....only Filet Mignon and Sirloin Steak were named by cut. The rest was stuff like Sliced Steak (2 of those), Beef Scallopini, and Medallions of Beef. Where's the Steak House menu? What's going on?The food list was short but they have one of the longest wine and liquor lists I've seen. We chose a bottle of Rioja (Marques de Murietta Castillo Ygay2000 Gran Reserva) which everyone liked. It's a sweet and light red, good for our light weight group.The salads were giant, but all the pieces were way bigger than bite size and having your customers eat your salad with a fork and knife is not a good sign.Lon ordered a crab and scallop appetizer, just simply broiled with butter, but it was really really good. This was the winner of the night. The seafood was fresh and cooked perfectly tender so that it melted in your mouth with the butter. MMM....We were a party of seven: 3 people ended up with Sirloin. Here's Lon's, cooked correctly (he requested rare), well seasoned, but just not very good meat. It was quite tendonous, which was exacerbated by the dull steak knives.I really didn't think anything looked interesting so I opted for the Extra Thick Veal Chop. It tasted like extra tendonous pork. The knives were really driving me nuts. I was having such a hard time cutting and my fingers started hurting because I was gripping so hard, so I just gave up and only ate about 1/3 of it.I ate some of Lon's steak and one of my mom's Lamb Chops, thick and juicy, meat quality just above average. They were cooked as asked and seasoned well.We shared the sides of asparagus (just blanched), spinach (also blanched), and Hash Brown Potatoes (more accurately home fries). The vegetables were very plain but cooked correctly. The potatoes were nicely crisped, although kind of ugly.Dessert was better than expected. Lon loved the pecan pie and we all enjoyed the coffee. A big pot is placed on the table so you can refill yourself.Overall, the food kind of sucks, service is average (but slow on water refills), plates are from your grandmother's attic (yea, even she doesn't use them anymore), and it's dang expensive!

Wild Blueberry Hand Pies
CONTENT
I want just about anything made with blueberries. Along with cherries, they share the pedestal for my favorite fruit, so when I saw a recipe for Blueberry Hand Pies on A Southern Grace, I bookmarked it right away. I did tweak the recipe a bit to my liking, but how can you go wrong with a portable pie, you can eat without a plate and fork?Wild Blueberry Hand Pies ~adapted from A Southern GraceSweet Pie DoughFillingAssemblyInstructions1. In a large bowl, mix together flour, sugar, and salt. Cut in butter with a fork or pastry cutter, until it resembles course sand.2. In a small cup, combine buttermilk and vanilla extract. Mix into dough and bring it together to form a ball. Press it into a disc. Plastic wrap it and chill for 1 hour.3. When dough has been chilling for 30 minutes, start working on the filling. Put all the filling ingredients into a small non-stick pot. Start on low and stir until juices are released. Now you can turn up the heat and stir until it thickens and looks like pie filling. Remove to a bowl and set aside.4. Grease cookie sheet and set aside. When dough is ready, roll out on a floured surface to 1/8″ thick. Cut into 4.5″ circles and arrange on cookie sheet 2 inches apart. If dough gets too soft, chill again.5. Put 1 1/2 tablespoon filling into each circle. In a small bowl, mix together egg yolk and water. Brush half the rim of each circle.6. Fold each circle in half and press edges together.It will look like a large dumpling.7. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F and chill the hand pies for 30 minutes while oven is heating.8. Remove from fridge and make a few slits/vents on each. Brush with egg wash and sprinkle with vanilla sugar.9. Bake for 16-18 minutes or until golden and filling bubbles. Cool for 5 minutes before carefully removing with a spatula. Cool on wire rack.

Marcos, you can probably buy vanilla sugar but it's easy to make at home. Any time you use a vanilla bean for a recipe, take the left-over pod and stick it in roughly 2 cups of sugar. Cover in airtight container and store for about a week before using.Soopling, absolutely....can I have some?

Kasha Varnishkes
CONTENT
Growing up, there were many Jewish delicacies that I truly loved. The nature of them ranged widely including items like smoke white fish (whole or as salad), knishes, wursts, etc. But one of the easiest, most enjoyable items was Kasha Varnishkes.My mom typically bought it pre-made from the supermarket or kosher deli, but could make them from time to time. There were three ways to enjoy the dish as far as I was concerned. Fresh (always the best), microwaved (which is surprisingly delicious!), or re-fried until the kasha and varnishkes (the Yiddish term for farfalle or bow-tie pasta) were brown and crispy. When I had it the fried way, sometimes I'd add mayo and eat it as a sandwich or with some sliced turkey breast... mmmmm nom nom nom (p.s. I just got my 22 month old niece to say 'nom nom').Jessica managed to pick up some dry kasha during her 9th avenue shopping tour. The smell of this grain drives me nuts, I love it! I couldn't wait to make it. I found a few recipes, but in the end, I settled back in on my mom's. It was a little messy, like all home recipes should be, but I've cleaned it up a bit for you.Before getting started, I'll highlight two points. First, I don't know where this came from. My mom had it jotted down somewhere, and I've adapted it a bit for clarity and my personal taste. Second, my mom and I agree it's good to have a fairly high ratio of pasta to kasha, but it's up to you. If you want to vary the ratio just increase or decrease the amount of pasta you use.Kasha Varnishkes~makes enough of a side dish for about 6-8 peopleIngredientsInstructions1. Boil pasta, following box instructions for soft (not al dente). Strain pasta and reserve, also reserve cooking water.2. Saute onion, with just cooking spray and salt. Reserve.3. In a large sauce pot, heat chicken fat and chicken stock. In a bowl, beat egg, mix with dry kasha. Cook kasha and egg mixture in a dry pan until egg is dry and kernels are separated.4. Add heated fat and stock mixture. Cook about 10 minutes in a high simmer.5. Add pasta, onion, and season liberally with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste. Toss in a little extra schmaltz and some pasta cooking water to give a nice sheen to the whole dish. Serve.Reheat in microwave or fry in vegetable oil to have an alternative style.

New England Clam Chowder
CONTENT
At the same supermarket where we picked up that delicious lobster, we also grabbed a variety of clams. I've been wanting to make some New England Clam Chowder, especially since I saw Bobby Flay's Throwdown with the Brooklyn Chowder Surfer.I'm a huge fan of clam anything, but especially clam chowder, and even more so, New England Clam Chowder (that's the creamy style). Why, just yesterday I was talking about how I love dairy. Well Ben Sargent, the Chowda Suhfah (he's Bostonian), seems to make a mean clam chowder, but doesn't seem to have posted his recipe anywhere. So, I examined several of his video clips (on Throwdown, on Martha Stewart, and others) and came up with my own recipe. Hopefully, this does his grandfather proud.The major, explicity change are the selection of clams. I excluded Razor Clams, as I despise them -- blegh. I also excluded Geoducks because they're insanely expensive.Honestly, this is, hands down, the best clam chowder I've ever tasted. I was worried it would be too fatty or too salty, but it was absolutely perfect. I'm amazed and will make this many more times in the future.New England Clam Chowderadapted from the Brooklyn Chowder Surfer~makes 12.5 cups (about 8 servings)IngredientsClams (16 Littlenecks, 9 Steamers, 2 Quahogs)Instructions1. Spit Clams. Layer clams into large pot (heaviest on the bottom), fill 1/3 height of clams with water. Steam ~10 minutes covered or until lid starts to rattle and hum. Remove clams; strain and reserve stock. Clean steamers and quahogs, roughly chop clams to about 1/2″ pieces, reserve.2. Render salt pork until golden brown, reserve fat and pork separately. Render bacon, discard fat, reserve bacon.3. In a large pot, saute potatoes, onion, fennel, and garlic in salt and oil for about 15 minutes over medium heat, stir every few minutes.4. Add butter, thyme, dill, sea salt, lots of fresh ground black pepper, reserved bacon, and fat from salt pork. Cover contents of pot with enough broth to cover the ingredients plus a bit extra (about 4.5 cups) then double that amount of broth with heavy cream (so about 4.5 cups). Bring to a rolling simmer (do not boil), then cook on very low for 25 minutes stirring intermittently.5. Add Worcestershire, Old Bay, capers, and clams. Cook another three minutes, taste for seasoning, add additional salt and pepper, as necessary.Serve in bread bowl or with crusty bread. Garnish bowl with some of the golden pork fat pieces.

Roasted Red Pepper and Onion Salad, Relish, or Bruschetta
CONTENT
I'm a little obsessed with roasted peppers and knowing that, I've tried not to post too much about them, but then I realized that I might be over-compensating and not posting enough about roasted peppers. After all, they are amazingly delicious and versatile.This is a great make-ahead recipe for when you're making lots of dishes. Make it the day before and just leave it in Tupperware, in the fridge, until ready to serve. It can be served as a salad, relish, or a bruschetta. For relishes and bruschetta, I tend to cut the strips thinner.Roasted Red Pepper and Onion Salad, Relish, or Bruschetta~makes 6 cupsInstructions -1. Cut onion into 1/2″to 3/4″ thick rings. Place on a cookie sheet covered with aluminum foil. Broil on the top rack until softened, about 3 minutes on each side. You don't want them to brown too much. Set aside and allow to cool.2. Fire roast the peppers (instructions here). Peel and cut into roughly 1/2″ to 3/4″ thick strips.3. Cut the onion circles in half. Discard any dry outer rings and separate the them. In a large bowl, toss together onions, roasted pepper strips, and capers.4. In a small bowl, whisk together olive oil, balsamic vinegar, garlic, and mustard. Toss together with peppers and onions. Season with salt and pepper, and refrigerate overnight.

Agreed. I love roasted bell peppers. It's a simple recipe that can be made in advance. The addition of the capers is awesome in the bruschetta.

Santorini Lobster - Attempt 1
CONTENT
Our first year anniversary is coming up (June 1st!), so perhaps that is conjouring themes of romance and memories of our honeymoon.One of the best moments of our honeymoon had to be sitting at Sunset Taverna, dining by the bay (three feet from it) in Santorini, Greece, and enjoying the best lobster pasta dish either of us ever had.Today, in a new supermarket in Flushing, we saw an absolutely beautiful, three pound lobster. I went to pet it and it jumped into my arms (not literally, but it was super active). And it was only $6.99 per pound... we had to have it!Jessica asked me to make dinner, as work has been keeping her very busy. I'm not the biggest fan of steamed lobster, I find it rather boring, and the first thing that came to mind was \"our\" dish, let's call it \"Santorini Lobster\".Well, I didn't quite nail the exact dish, but I made something super delicious. Normally I wouldn't post an attempt unless it came out correctly, but this was so good, that it doesn't matter that it wasn't the same as the original. Make this. However, at the end of this post, I'll post a few notes for next time, that should move it closer to the original.Santorini Lobster - Attempt 1~makes two huge, or three normal portionsIngredientsInstructions1. Kill lobster (push knife through back of head, behind eyes), cut off tail and slice every other section, remove claws (if cold water) and crack open, separate arms; reserve in a bowl. If there is any fat or roe, keep separate.2. In a large saute pan, with high sides, heat 3 tbsp. of olive oil over medium heat. Add onions and a good pinch of salt. Cook until onions are browning and soft, about six minutes. Add garlic and red pepper flakes.3. Add lobster to pan and cover, cook about three minutes. Turn lobster pieces, cover, and cook another three minutes. Remove lobster back to bowl, except the head; try to keep onions in the pan. If there is roe or fat add to pan. Deglaze with vinegar and orange juice. Add orange segments, tomatoes, oregano, and black pepper. Cook about three minutes.4. Remove head from sauce, return other lobster to sauce, add pasta, add remaining olive oil, add additional salt, toss together. Taste for seasoning and plate.Now that you know how to make \"attempt 1″, here are some tips for next time, a.k.a. attempt 2:Mmmm... we can't wait until next time!

We've had this bottle of Santa Julia Tardio 2003 in our fridge for a while. Neither of us remember how we got it but we finally decided to sip a little dessert wine the other night, while watching \"House\". (Yes, we need cordial glasses. Perhaps when we move one day.)It's more just sweet than flavorful so skip this one. There are many better ones out there.

LaGuardia Seafood Buffet
CONTENT
Jessica's mom told us about a new buffet in Astoria, where the food is good and the price is low, real low. It turns out the location is a few blocks from where I used to live, and I was excited to see that the area had major renovations, including a fancy, new strip mall. It's in that new strip mall where LaGuardia Seafood Buffet LaGuardia Seafood Buffet resides. By the time we got there, it was almost 1pm and we were starving. The restaurant was about half full, which isn't bad for that area, on a Tuesday. Most of the patrons were senior citizens and a handful of families. More importantly, there was food.The question was it good food? The answer, was: eh, not really. Let's have a look...The sushi was bland at best. There was too much rice, with too little seasoning. And the plates were not well maintained. One or two pieces, with tempura, were passable, but not good. Jessica described the squid as \"rubbery\".The spare ribs were the worst I've eaten, tough and overly sweet. There were whole fried fish, but none of us tasted them.There was a whole section of fried up what not. Some were quite tasty, particularly the Pan-Fried Pork Dumplings: they were super meaty. Also the Bacon-Wrapped Shrimp were delicious; the first time I've seen real shrimp (as opposed to that fake prawn stuff) at a buffet. However, all of the fried items were room temperature, not good for fried items.The Octopus Salad was beautiful, but the seafood was chewy and grainy.Jessica and I both (independently) thought the golden, gooey-glazed goodness above was going to be shrimp. She thought so because of the length of the items and I thought so because of the strips of red something. It turns out this was batter-fried chicken. The sauce was way too sweet, and the white meat chicken was a tad dry. It looked better than it tasted.I was excite to see rice cakes on the buffet. They were golden-coloured and paired with crab. They tasted extremely buttery, but didn't offer much else in terms of flavor. Oh yeah, and they were cold.In terms of pure flavor, I think this was my favorite dish. Mussels, shrimp, and crab in a curry sauce. The sauce was rich and thick, the seafood was pretty tasty. However, it was cold. Seeing a pattern yet?Kelly and I both loved the Japanese Eggplant. It was not oily at all and perfectly seasoned. The Seafood and Chive Bun was beautifully creased, but lacking seafood inside, and not enjoyable. The Mini-Jamaican Beef Patties were fun. The golden crust was great, while the filling was average.Jessica and Kelly agreed that the best thing in the restaurant was there Sesame Balls with Red Bean Paste. I tasted one and agreed they were delicious. Interesting, since Kelly and I don't normally eat these. The outside is cruncy from the sesame, then taut, almost like mochi, then chewy, then creamy. Really nice. Plus Jessica has a hard time finding the ones with red bean paste these days. Most places use lotus paste.The dessert selection was pretty sad: two types of cake (we skipped these), some canned peaches, a few fruits, vanilla & chocolate pudding, and soft serve ice cream.So to summarize the food: nothing was terrible, but it was all average at best. And painfully, it was ALL room temperature. Nothing was hot and many of the fried items were not crispy. They did use P.E.I. mussels, which are the best, and that's nice to see.However, the price... $7.60 per person (with tax) is unbeatable. A sandwich costs that much. We probably each ate that much in fruit alone! The price is temporary though, it's a marketing discount to help introduce the new restaurant.We wouldn't recommend traveling for the deal, but if you happen to be in Astoria, at lunch time on a weekday (which is the only time the deal is available), give it a shot.

Well, lots of people (including Paula herself) joke about how much butter she uses. But, this recipe tops the list. Sent in by Stephen: Paula's Fried Butter Balls. Essentially it's deep fried butter.Tickets to Cabaret Gourmet 2009 begin at $75. For reservations and information, contact Matt Morrow at 212-398-2977 or email mmorrow@playco.org.

Carol's Matzoh Brei
CONTENT
On Sunday, we were invited to Carol's for Matzoh Brei and it was such a treat, surely the best matzoh brei you'll ever have. I guess this shouldn't be surprising since this comes from award winning cookbook author (and my mentor), Carol Gelles. Armed with some clear instructions, we came home and replicated it, wrote it all down, so that you too can have the best Matzoh Brei ever! Carol's version is essentially Matzoh French Toast, fluffy soft custard middle, with a crispy outside. It's so good!Carol's Matzoh Brei~makes 3 (8″) matzoh breiInstructions-1. Crumble matzoh into a bowl. Pour milk over it and let it sit until most of the milk is absorbed. It will take about 40 minutes and you will need to stir once or twice so all the matzoh is soaked.2. Beat the eggs in a small bowl. Mix into matzoh mixture and stir in salt.3. Heat 1/2 tablespoon of butter in an 8″ non-stick pan, on medium flame. Spoon 1/3 of the mixture into the pan and spread into an even layer. Allow the mixture to form one solid pancake and for the bottom to crisp, about 3 minutes. Flip it over and crisp the other side for about 2 minutes. Serve immediately.We had some with raspberry preserves, some with cinnamon sugar, and Carol has hers with maple syrup.

Just like to throw in my family's two cents...We make matzoh brei just like french toast.  Basically,  you soak crushed matzoh in milk for 15 mihutes,  and then add in eggs, sugar, cinnamon, vanilla, and any milk you like(i, obviously would choose cream,  but whatever),  mix it around till its the consistency of, well,  is congee too weird??? and fry in butter and/or oil.

2009-04-14 18:48:00
Pearl, Matzoh brei is basically what you see here, but there are different versions, milk, no milk, and how the matzoh is soaked or wet....Teanna, I was thinking the same thing...it's perfect for brunch.Meyerboy, it sounds like your family has a winning version!

Matzoh Balls
CONTENT
There can not be a person on this planet who doesn't like Matzoh Balls, and if there is, I'm not sure I want to meet them! Known in Yiddish as knaidelach, which literally means \"dumplings\". They're super delicious and easy to make.I acknowledge that there are different preferences. Some people like their knaidelach extremely fluffy, while others prefer stones. My ideal matzoh ball is the way my mom does it: fluffy outside, denser inside. To be honest, I'm not totally sure what causes this variation, but some add baking powder to achieve fluff, while others think ice water does it. This recipe uses neither and they come out wonderful every time. My mom says that using schmaltz will not only make this unhealthier but will also make the balls heavier, so we opt for vegetable oil here (crazy, huh?).Matzoh BallsAdapted from my mom, you may scale this recipe up or down as necessary.~makes 8 ballsIngredientsInstructions1. Break up matzoh by hand into food processor, pulse until pieces are about the size of rice grains. Reserve. Note you should have about 1/2 a cup.2. In a medium bowl, beat eggs. Add remaining ingredients and combine well. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 45 minutes, longer is okay if necessary.3. In your widest pot, boil plenty of water. When water is at a high boil, remove mixture from fridge. Wet hands with cold water to keep mixture from sticking. Roll 1.5-inch diameter balls and drop into the boiling water. The balls will expand as they cook, so make sure there is plenty of room in the pot. If necessary, cook in batches. When pot is full, cover and cook at a medium heat for 40 minutes.4. When done remove directly into soup broth. Or you can cool and refrigerate for later use. If not stored in soup, then store in boiling liquid. Otherwise the matzoh ball will harden and be inedible.If you're looking for alternative methods for eating these treats, I'll share my two, non-soup methods. First, you can slice the balls into 3/4-inch slices and fry in schmaltz or vegetable oil. Eat on matzoh or by itself. Second, you can prepare a thick sauce of chicken bouillon, corn starch and hot water. The consistency should be very thick, something like Chinese lobster sauce. Heat the matzoh ball in water, drain thoroughly, and coat heavily with the sauce. Yum!

My version of Mom's recipe refrigerates for 2 hours with 45 being the minimum. They come out better if you refrigerate closer to the 2 hrs than to 45 minutes.Also, some people add seltzer to make fluffier. I call them heretics, but that's another issue.

Schmaltz & Grieven
CONTENT
We realized that we cover many Chinese dishes on FoodMayhem, but with the exception of the recent Matzoh Brei post, we rarely discuss Jewish dishes. Tonight we took on that task full charge. Making quite a few dishes at once.First things first. One of the key ingredients in Jewish cooking is rendered chicken fat, also known by its Yiddish term, Schmaltz. So before cooking, I had to get my hands on some. But where? Well we just made it... it's not hard.While butchering a chicken, trim off as much fat and skin as you can and dice into pieces no larger than about 1.5″ squares. Place skin and fat in a small, non-stick sauce pot and heat on low, covered, for about 10 minutes, then remove the cover. Continue simmering it until the skin is thoroughly gray and very shriveled. Then remove from heat. Strain out the skin and reserve it.What you have now is schmaltz. Note it's golden glow. Seriously, the stuff glows. If you've ever wondered why Jewish men are so hairy, it's because of this stuff, it'll grow hair on anyone! Plus, it's a natural preservative due to its extremely long shelf life.Now, you know homely food, we waste nothing. So it's time to make Grieven (also known as Gribenes)... this is the Yiddish word for \"scraps\". Basically, these are the Jewish version of pork rinds, but in my opinion, infinitely better.Those gray shreds of skin are about to be turned into heaven. Return them to the same pot that you used to render the schmaltz. Or, if you want to do it another day, you can start with a clean, non-stick pot. You don't need to add any fat, trust me, there's plenty remaining in that skin. Heat over low, and add diced onion and kosher salt. You can also add some whole cloves of garlic if you like. Don't worry about over-crowding the pot at this point.Cook on low until the onion has turned very dark brown, about 15 minutes. At this point, it's time to crisp the skin. To do so, you must ensure the pot is not over-crowded. Remove enough so there is less than one layer full. Cook on medium-low another 5 minutes until it's crisp, you should be able to feel this with a fork. Remove contents to a paper-towel lined bowl. Add back reserved skin and fry that, repeat as necessary.Generally, the onions are burnt and discarded, but sometimes I eat them. This stuff is insanely good. Eat it as a snack, or use it on a salad instead of bacon, or add it to your favorite pasta dish. Trust me, it's amazing.

My grandmother and mother did this a little differently.  They put the chicken skin and fat into a pot with water and boiled it until the water had evaporated completely leaving the fat and skin. They let the skin get a little golden, then added sliced onions and cooked the whole thing until the onions were browned and chicken skin crisp.  Then strain the scmaltz and drain the chicken skin and onion on paper towels.  Eating the onions is the best part - or even better is stirring them into mashed potatoes.

Carol, it's funny you mention that!  My mom just sent me her recipe for bilkes this morning.  It's basically what you described: onions and grieven in mashed potatoes.  It's taken one step further, in that it's spread thin (about 3/4″) on a baking sheet and toasted until it's crisp.  Then it's broken into pieces (like peanut brittle) and served.

We met Shruti and Ekta for a pretty nice lunch at Bocca Bocca on Friday but forgot our camera! Ugh, you have no idea how mad I was at myself. I think I went a little crazy, tried not to sulk too publicly, and then decided to try some pics with my cell phone. So, the pics are fuzzy but I guess better than nothing.Bocca has a two course lunch deal for $19.95, an appetizer and a main. Lon started with a salad with grilled calamari, slightly fishy but cooked nicely. I started with Veal meatballs with truffle pecorino on top. We all thought it tasted like cheap provolone and would've been better without the cheese (OMG, did I just say that?). The meat was tender but didn't have much flavor. Luckily, it sat in a pool of very rich and flavorful gravy/jus that we sopped up with bread.Lon had the Capricci: Spiral Setaro Pasta with Sweet Sausage. Lon enjoyed this dish a lot but it was so incredibly heavy and salty, I couldn't have eaten more than two bites in the same sitting.

Oxtails in Chinese Tomato Sauce
CONTENT
Oxtails in Chinese Tomato Sauce was a regular part of growing up. My brother and I loved this dish; we're practically made of this stuff. So when I opened my fridge and stared at the oxtails, I knew I had to make it for Lon so I called me mom for instructions. It turns out, it's ridiculously easy, so if you have kids, this will end up being a regular in your house. I didn't have a single cousin (in my large family) that could resist this stuff.My mom makes this dish with fresh ginger. I didn't have any so I had to adjust a bit, but either way, it tastes great!Oxtail in Chinese Tomato SauceInstructions - 1. Place oxtails in a medium sized pot. Cover with cold water and bring to a boil. Remove from heat and drain. Clean skum off of pot and return oxtails to the pot.2. Add tomatoes with liquid, soy sauce, shallots, sugar, and ginger. Stir and bring to a boil. Reduce to a simmer and cover. Cook for 30 minutes.3. Uncover and continue simmering for another 30 minutes, or until sauce has thickened. While it cooks, I skim about 1/2 cup of oil off the top.4. I grew up eating this with rice but you can also eat it with bread. The sauce is salty so use sparingly.You'll have a ton of sauce left over so stay tuned for what else we do with it...

Oxtail is excellent, and much under-rated.  It's cheap too.I think some people are a bit squeamish about eating a cow's tail, my wife included.  I never tell her we're having oxtail until it's way too late to change anything!I've never prepared it in a Chinese style, but I will now.

Matzoh Brei
CONTENT
There are two standard breakfasts that my family eats during Pesach (Passover): Matzoh Cereal (which is basically cream of wheat, made of matzoh meal) and Matzoh Brei. I absolutely love both! Maybe it's because I only eat them a few days a year and distance makes the heart grow fonder. Or maybe it's just because I'm Jewish?Pretty much, all Jews just love matzoh brei. Here's a great line from Neil Kramer's blog about the brei:That pretty much sums it up.What is matzoh brei? At it's simplest, it is beaten eggs combined with softened matzoh, fried together. But like anything the tribe does, there must be various schools of thought, otherwise there can not be arguments (a mainstay of the Jewish tradition).I found a fun interview between Jews: Mark Bittman and famed architect, Frank Gehry where they discuss matzoh brei. It's worth a watch. Especially because they highlight the fact that there are at least two divisions of thought on brei. The first division is how wet the matzoh should be. I.e., should it be absolute mush or should it just be softened enough to crumble? I am absolutely in the latter camp. A second division, is whether the brei should be savory (salt & pepper) or sweet (sugar or jam). I am okay for either, but 95% of the time prepare it savory.What they don't discuss is a third division, which is most important to me: whether it should be cooked as a pancake or scrambled. By a wide margin, most people prepare it as a pancake-like dish. However, I always cook it scrambled. I think it comes out much better and really lets you get the flavors and texture.Before we hit the recipe, I'll mention fat. The absolutely traditional way to cook brei is in schmaltz (rendered chicken fat). My mother usually used butter, the more common approach these days. That way you can live long enough to have seconds. Because I don't keep a Kosher for Passover (Kasher shel Pesach) home, I use cooking spray.So, for a savory, scrambled matzoh brei, this is just about as easy as it gets!Savory, Scrambled Matzoh Brei~makes one serving. Scales easily: two eggs per two matzoh per personIngredientsInstructions1. Scramble eggs in a large bowl.2. Under warm, running tap water, rub fingers over one pieces of matzoh until the top layer becomes loose, that means it's ready to break. Apply slight pressure until matzoh folds on itself. Fold until smaller pieces. Remove from water and let excess water run off, add to egg. Repeat for each piece of matzoh.3. Fold egg and matzoh together while heating a non-stick frying pan with cooking spray. Add egg and matzoh to pan while stirring. Every few seconds fold matzoh around in pan, to keep it scrambled. To form a pancake, simply don't move the matzoh, and press it to the shape of the pan.4. When mostly dry (but not completely), remove to plate and season generously with kosher salt and lots of freshly ground black pepper.

Hot Cross Buns
CONTENT
Since Hot Cross Buns are traditionally made on Good Friday, we couldn't miss out on that. Any excuse for food is a good excuse. Most commonly made with raisins or currants, ours are made with a mix of dried cranberries, dried blueberries, and raisins, adapted from a highly rated recipe on allrecipes.com, with the icing altered as well. Oh yea, and I'm lazy so I changed this into a mixer recipe where all the kneading is done by machine. Sing it with me now....Hot Cross Buns...Hot Cross Buns...Hot Cross BunsIcingInstructions - 1. In a large mixing bowl of a stand mixer, combine 2 cups flour, sugar, yeast, cinnamon and salt. In a saucepan, heat milk and butter to 120 degrees F-130 degrees F. Add to dry ingredients; beat just until moistened. Add eggs;beat until smooth. Stir in raisins and dried cranberries, and 2 more cups flour to form a soft dough. Switch to a dough hook and knead until smooth and elastic, about 4-6 minutes, adding a little more flour if necessary. Place in a bowl coated with nonstick cooking spray, turning once to coat top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour.2. Punch dough down; turn onto a lightly floured surface. Divide into 18 pieces; shape each into a ball. Place in two 9-in. round baking pans coated with nonstick cooking spray. Using a sharp knife, cut a cross on top of each roll. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 30 minutes. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.3. Beat egg yolk and water; brush over buns. Bake for 18-22 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from pans to wire racks to cool.4. Combine icing ingredients; pipe crosses onto rolls.

When Yumiko came from Japan, she brought these amazing rice crackers. I'm already pretty addicted to the rice crackers you can buy here, but these are even better. Each individual bag (in the box of 12 bags) has a nice colorful assortment of unique flavors. Of course, with Japanese products, you have to admire the packaging as well, but leave it to them to make the most adorable snacks.

Chocolate Chip Pecan Mandelbrot
CONTENT
Every year at Passover, I can't wait till we get to dessert, mostly because of Bonnie's (Lon's mom) Chocolate Chip Pecan Mandelbrot. If you haven't had Mandelbrot, it's a cross between biscotti and scones. I love it!Bonnie's made this recipe countless times and has tried many variations. You can use different nuts for nice alternatives but her secret is Parkay Margarine. She says all other butters and margarines won't give you the same shape and texture. Thanks for the recipe Bonnie!Chocolate Chip Pecan MandelbrotInstructions:Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Grease 2 cookie sheets.Cream sugar with margarine until light and fluffy. Add eggs one at a time beating after each addition. In a separate bowl, sift together cake meal, starch, and salt. Mix into creamed mixture. Finely chop the pecans and stir in with the chocolate chips. Mix well. Form into 2 loaves each about 2” wide. Sprinkle with cinnamon and sugar, trim with nuts.Place on greased cookie sheets and bake for 45 minutes. Remove and cool completely.

Jessica found out that April is Grilled Cheese Month, as being celebrated by Pithy and Cleaver, amongst many others. Kraft is of course having fun with it. Los Angeles restaurant Clementine is loving the month as usual too. Then there is the cheese industry in Wisconsin. For Jessica, a true cheese lover, this is heaven.So we're holding the second of our FoodMayhem Reader's Choice (the first was Crawfish Season). There are so many delicious ideas for grilled cheese that we'd like to do. But frankly cheese is dang expensive, so help us pick which combination you think would be best and we'll whip it up.The goal of each of these is to first focus on the cheese (most important); second is the bread; and finally details. We'll keep this poll open until end of day, Friday, April 17, 2009.

Marumi

Lon and I needed a sushi fix. It's been a while and we've been so busy, including having limited time last night, so we chose Marumi Marumi for being reasonably close by. We were surprised by how full they were at 6pm but we were still able to get seats right away. Whenever possible, I try to sit at the sushi bar, but here it seems to have made no difference.I chose a Scallop Uni appetizer which is a steal at $8. There's roughly 5 pieces of scallop and 5 pieces of uni. They are fresh but not spectacular, but again, it's $8. The one problem is that it's hard to pick up together.My sushi entree came with this salad. It wasn't great, iceberg with an acidic soy sauce dressing, but I always appreciate getting a bit of salad.

Pork Belly and Bean Curd Noodle Soup
CONTENT
It seems readers enjoy hearing about how we re-make left-overs into brand new meals, so it'll be a regular thing now at FoodMayhem. Our latest is the make-over of the almost Dan Barber's Pork Belly into a Pork Belly and Bean Curd Noodle Soup.Since the left-overs were refrigerated, the fat had conveniently separated to the top. I removed most of that and was left with broth and slow cooked pork belly. I heated the broth in a pot, adding chicken broth and water, being careful because this broth was already seasoned and spiced. I threw in some diced bean curd.Meanwhile, the pork belly was cut in pieces and heated up on cast iron with sliced leeks. You want to wait till the pork crisps up and the leeks are soft.

Broccoli with Grapefruit
CONTENT
To accompany an Italian-inspired dinner the other night for Sophia & Justin, I came up with a surprisingly delicious side dish -- go me! I recall various interesting Italian dishes that used strong citrus flavors and the most typical seemed to be lemon and grapefruit.I didn't write my recipe but here's the gist. I cut broccoli florets to consistent sizes and gave them a good rinse. Then I left them in a bowl with some minced garlic and a few chopped up wedges of grapefruit. Meanwhile I squeezed about half a grapefruit worth of juice into a separate bowl.We heated the wok to medium-high with some vegetable oil. Jessica tossed the broccoli-garlic-grapefruit mixture in and seasoned with salt and pepper. Then she added a bit of the juice at a time, enough to keep the steam rising through the broccoli to cook it.When it was done cooking, it was a perfect dish, with the sweetness and acidity balanced along with the perfect al dente broccoli. Try this out!

Chestnut
CONTENT
Now that the weather is warming up, I plan to start hitting some of those Brooklyn places on my \"list\". Yesterday we hit ChestnutChestnut for brunch with Peter and Jeff, where Brooklyn adventures get off to a slow start, partly because Pete was 30 minutes late (are you reading this Mr?), and partly because Chestnut didn't cut it for us.Upon arriving to our table, we saw that Lon's chair was covered in crumbs. Two of the bread plates were dirty, and later, Jeff was served coffee with a mug that had a smudge of something on the side. Our refillable coffee was also never refilled till we were done eating (and plates were already starting to be cleared) and only because I flagged someone down for it. They were not busy either, with plenty of staff and a few empty tables.Brunch here is served with complimentary popovers and chocolate chip scones, which were both good in a standard sort of way, nothing memorable. We thought it was a bit odd for four of us to be served only two each but I'm sure we could have asked for more.

Rosemary Pomegranate Coated Rack of Pork
CONTENT
It's been weeks since Carol introduced me to Pomegranate Molasses, and I finally got to using it this week. While it's called molasses, it's really a syrup: sweet and tart with concentrated pomegranate flavor. It's plain wonderful!Rosemary Pomegranate Coated Rack of Pork~makes 8 entreesIngredientsInstructions1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.2. Stir together pomegranate molasses, garlic, rosemary, and black strap molasses. Rub all over pork. Season generously with salt and pepper.3. Set on a rack, propped up by a carrot on each side. Wrap the bones in aluminum foil to avoid burning.4. Roast for 1 hour 20 minutes, or until internal temperature reads 135 degrees F. Remove from oven and rest for 15 minutes, where it will carry-over cook to 145 degrees F.5. Slice between each bone and serve. Garnish with fresh rosemary.I will be using pomegranate molasses a lot for sure, but if you can't wait for more recipes, check out some delicious looking ones here.

Scallion-Garlic Bread
CONTENT
To accompany dinner last night, I put together a tasty Scallion-Garlic Bread. It came out delicious, but a big part of that was due to the delicious bread that we picked up at Costco.Scallion-Garlic Bread~ side dish serves 4-8 peopleIngredientsInstructions1. Pre-heat oven to 350 deg F.2. In a food processor, pulse butter, garlic, and oil together until smooth. Add scallion and pulse a few more times until combined. The scallion should still be evident as individual pieces.3. Slice bread open into two separate pieces. Spread a very good amount of butter mixture onto both halves. Sprinkle generously with kosher salt. Then season with pepper and paprika.4. Toast in 350 deg F. for 15 minutes. Slice into separate pieces and serve hot.Yum, your guests, if anything like ours, will not be able to resist!

White Manna
CONTENT
Bill has been raving about White Manna for some time now and yesterday he was kind enough to take me and Jessica for a mini road trip that included some of New Jersey's finest destinations: Target, Costco, and White Manna White Manna.We were told that the original White Mana (note the lack of a second 'n'), built in 1939, is in Jersey City, but has changed owners several times and has gone way down hill. The Hackensack location we visited opened in 1946. Either way, both copied the style and name of the original slider, White Castle, which opened in 1921. White Manna is pretty cruddy looking and very small, but they make a mean slider.When you order, your choices are \"ham\" (for hamburger) or \"cheese\" (for cheeseburger) and \"with onions\" or \"without onions\". Unlike some restaurants that are particular about the ordering process, the only thing the burger cook (who stands up front) cares about is that you don't ask her for fries... because a different cooks does those. Her process is to grab about an ounce or two of beef (pre-formed nuggets), lay them out on an approximately 2 by 3-foot griddle, lay super-thin onion shreds across the top, then slap them flat with a spatula.After cooking two or three minutes, they get a flip (turning the onions onto the bottom), then most get American Cheese, and buns stacked on top. Two or three minutes later and they're ready. If you take them to go, each burger gets a shot of ketchup and some pickle slices, then is wrapped into wax paper. If you're staying, you get pickles on the side and apply your own ketchup. Burgers are a greasy, cheesy mess, but they're steaming hot and pretty tasty!They're $1.30 each ($1.10 for hams or $2.05 for doubles), and slightly larger than White Castle. They also use fresher-looking ingredients and larger, fluffier, eggier buns than White Castle. The burgers were under-seasoned, but Jessica suggested that adding salty ketchup and pickles helps compensate for that.They also sell fries, but as Bill warned, they're frozen and nothing special. Jessica took the plain and I took them with a side bucket of melted cheese. Eh, they were under-seasoned, under-cooked, and mediocre at best. Skip them.We sat at the tiny counter (hurting my back due to the lack of space) and watched the line grow and grow. I also watched the slow service (6 minutes to cook a slider?). I guess this is why White Castle has grown tremendously and Manna has not. Bill has never tasted White Castle and Jessica feels they taste like nothing. I, however, love White Castle and think it blows White Manna out of the water. Jessica and I agreed the sliders were good and well worth the price, but absolutely not worth the drive. So unless we lived within the immediate area of White Manna, we wouldn't go again (plus we can just make our own sliders), but it was fun to try a new place.

Spaghetti Nests
CONTENT
If you're like me, you have a desire to keep playing with food, coming up with new uses. Well tonight I wanted to try something new. I've had fried pasta before and I've seen dried pasta that comes in little nests before (usually in Latin markets). I wanted to make my own fried nests. The thought was that they would be crisp, but then soften in a delicious sauce.Here's the basic technique... boil off some angel hair or thin spaghetti. I used some thin spaghetti from the fridge (unused from when Jessica made the Pork Belly), they were nice and starchy. Grab a dozen or so strands (don't count, just grab) and align them together. Drape them over your fingers and give them a twist around each other (think Twizzlers). Then pull one end of the strand under your fingers and twist them around the top (on top of your fingers). Repeat with the other end of the strand, going the opposite direction around your fingers. Once I made a loop, I found it help to put my finger through the center, and pull the pasta through.The idea is to have the pasta spiraling around itself as it goes into a circle. Don't worry if it's messy, it's a pain to do. Rest your nests on a cutting board and heat vegetable oil in a non-stick frying pan. Lay in one or more nests at a time (depending on the size of your pan) and fry just until the edges start to take color and blister, about 90 seconds. Then use chopsticks to turn it over and cook another 60 seconds.Remove to paper towels to drain.I plated them by piling three on a plate overlapping each other (sort of Olympic Rings style).Then I dropped a bit of a yummy chicken with tomato & cream sauce into the center of each one. This plate is garnished with paprika, basil, and scallions -- the components of the sauce.

Chocolate Oatmeal Sandwich Cookies
CONTENT
I had Chocolate Cream Cheese Frosting left-over from the Drunken Cupcakes and I couldn't just let it go to waste. Instead of more cupcakes, I decided on cookies. (Most frosting are great as a cookie filling too.) These Chocolate Oatmeal Sandwich Cookies are not sophisitcated; they're more the kind kids love to eat and smear all over themselves. They are very chocolaty and somewhat chewy and some said they were like brownies.Chocolate Oatmeal Sandwich Cookies~makes about 20 cookies, 10 sandwich cookiesInstructions-1. Preheat oven to 350°F and grease 3 cookie sheets.2. Melt unsweetened chocolate, chocolate chips, and butter in a double boiler, stirring until smooth. Remove from heat and set aside.3. Beat eggs, sugar, and instant espresso in an electric mixer on high speed until very thick and pale and mixture forms a ribbon when beaters are lifted, about 3 minutes.4. Beat in chocolate mixture.5. In a separate bowl, sift together flour, baking powder, and salt. Fold the flour mixture and oatmeal into batter until just combined.6. Drop in heaping tablespoons onto baking sheets, 2 inches apart. Bake in the middle of the oven for 8-10 minutes, or until puffed and a little cracked on top. Do not over-bake! It may still look very soft.7. Cool on cookie sheets for 1 minutes, then carefully remove to wore rack to cool completely.8. Fill with Chocolate Cream Cheese Frosting. I like to pipe in the filling for more control. Make sure to get all the way to the edges.You can serve these on their own, but they are a little under-sweet because they are meant for a filling.

I found this recipe for pork belly a while back and have been anticipating making it. Ideally, I would have followed this recipe to the \"T\" but I didn't have some exact things. The result should be close though.Keep this recipe around as one of your make-ahead recipes. Lon pointed out that it's like a pork belly confit, so what could be wrong with that?Pork Belly~Adapted from Dan Barber's Pork BellyCure Mix1.5 pounds pork belly (in 3 pieces)chicken stock to cover1. Grind coriander, fennel, peppercorns, star anise, and cinnamon stick in a food processor.Remove to a bowl and stir in salt, sugar, cumin, and cloves. Rub it all over the pork belly. Cover and refrigerate for 3 days.2. Preheat oven to 200 degrees F. Wash the rub off the pork belly and lay in a pan, just large enough to fit in a single layer. Cover with stock and place in the oven for 7 hours.3. Cut into pieces and crisp the skin side in a pan before serving.

great minds think alike! i made this last week, and it was awesome!  i didn't have fennel seeds or cloves, and so i just adjusted the cure mix to taste, and it was still really amazing.  the crisp skin is key, and i found that scoring the skin side and searing on relatively low heat helped caramelize and crisp up the skin.

Coffee from Rwanda
CONTENT
Our friend Angie just got back from Rwanda where her company is helping out with a new village/school. (Learn more and donate here.)Despite the lack of exciting cuisine there, they're prowess as coffee producers is expanding, and we got to try some of this, still hard to get, coffee.Angie brought us some beans from Bourbon Coffee, a Rwandan based company with plans to open up in DC. They use Bourbon Arabica beans, which has been growing wildly in Rwanda for over a century now. It was incredibly smooth, no acidity, no burnt taste. I was just commenting to Angie last night that it's reminiscent of Kona coffee. Now reading the bag, it makes sense because the Virunga region has six volcanos and the volcanic soil is what makes Kona unique as well. These Bourbon Coffee beans are more mild so I will be using more beans per cup since I like a stronger cup, but the flavor is still wonderful and it seems, this will be more affordable than pure Kona.

We've been buying wonderfull green coffee beans from Rwanda lately.  It is truly a wonderful coffee - and we really love it at a lighter roast.  Darker roasts seem to blunt the great flavor nuances.

Trader Joe's Ridiculous Lines
CONTENT
We enjoy the products at Trader Joe's (such as sweets, feta, yogurts, grain products, and other snacks) , but the lines are just horrible. The store is a disorganized mess that simply can not handle the volume of business they're getting. I'm sure that's a wonderful problem to have for the owners (who I recently learned was a huge German discount-grocery chain).Jessica sent me over this morning to pick up some eggs and yogurt, I also picked up some whole wheat naan and soy milk. They open their doors at 9am, so I got there at 8:45am just to be safe, and maybe they would open a few minutes early (they didn't). When I got there, there were already about three people waiting. Averaging one new person or couple every 30 seconds, by the time the doors opened, I counted over 35 shoppers (excluding me) waiting and I counted couples as one!Now, I happened to be waiting exactly at the door, but regardless, several little old women tried like crazy to push past me to be the first ones in. Nut jobs. I let them go, then when they struggled to lift baskets out of the tall stack, I smirked as I grabbed one and walked past. Hehehe, take that hares, said this tortoise. Anyway, I was a pretty fast shopper, but there were already several people at checkout when I walked out at about 9:05am. Oy.

Is that the USQ location?  Initially the TJ in Queens was fairly empty but lately I've noticed that there are people waiting on WEEKDAYS at opening time, and though the place is big enough to handle it, if you get there an hour after opening, the parking lot is packed and the place is a bit nuts.  Nowhere near USQ but nuts for Queens!

Yvo - Yep, I was at the USQ location.  I initially thought it was just the USQ location that was horrible, but I've heard from people around the country that they're all messes.

Oren's Daily Roast
CONTENT
I used to rave about Oren's Daily Roast (multiple locations) as one of my favorite coffees in NYC, but I just had a cup yesterday and it was acidic. I know they change the coffee blend daily but when I used to live close to one, I had a cup nearly every day and never ran into one I didn't like. I'll likely give them another shot before making an irrevocable decision but this is very sad.

Drunken Cupcakes Two Ways
CONTENT
I saw a Chocolate Stout Cake on 1Family Friendly Food, who had adapted their recipe from Closet Cooking, so I decided to have a little version of our own. We don't have stout around but still have plenty of that Blackened Voodoo Lager from when we made Crawfish Gumbo and I just had to make them into cupcakes. (I tried really hard not to, but I did end up making two sizes again, regular and minis.)I wasn't thrilled with the frosting in this recipe. The flavor is very good but it doesn't pipe well, and there wasn't enough for the amount of cake anyway, so I made another frosting for the rest.Drunken Cupcakes Two Ways~adapted from Chocolate Stout CakeDirections:1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Put paper liners in muffin tins.2. Melt the butter in a sauce pan, remove from heat and let cool a bit.3. Mix in the stout and cocoa powder.4. Mix the flour, sugar, baking soda and salt in a seperate bowl.4. Mix the eggs and sour cream in another large bowl.5. Mix the stout mixture into the egg mixture.6. Mix the dry ingredients into the wet.7. Spoon batter into prepared muffin tins.8. Bake for 15 minutes for regular size or 9 minutes for minis, or until toothpick comes out clean. Cool in pan 10 minutes. Remove to cooling rack to cool completely.Bailey's Cream Cheese Frosting(if only using this frosting, double this recipe)Using the paddle attachment, beat cream cheese adding sugar gradually. Beat in Bailey's. Frost cupcakes.For the rest of the cupcakes, I used the Chocolate Cream Cheese Frosting from Cupcake Project, which tastes great and pipes amazingly.

I made Bailey's frosting using cream cheese and mascarpone for St. Paddy's day, and this is the first time I've had a good frosting for spreading on some delicious cupcakes. My recipe is quite similar in proportion to the one you have listed-I wonder if it's the texture of the cream cheese or something... I have no idea really, but I sure am glad the mascarpone saved the day.I love the mini next to the big sibling cupcake-so cute!

Ju[i]cy Lucy Burgers
CONTENT
On a recent episode of \"Man v. Food\", Adam headed to Minneapolis, MN to take on some monster brat. Along the way he sampled the two famed Jucy Lucy and Juicy Lucy (note the spelling differences) at Matt's Bar and 5-8 Club, respectively.A Jucy Lucy is a cheeseburger that has the cheese inside the beef, rather than on top. They looked delicious! So we decided to assemble our version. One with the classic American Cheese filling, and another with Fontina, a delicious Italian cheese that melts so well. Because these burgers are supposed to cook farther (to medium or medium-well) than we prefer our burgers (medium-rare), we added spinach to the beef, to help keep it moist. They were delicious!FoodMayhem Jucy Lucy Burgers~makes 4 burgersIngredientsInstructions1. Pre-heat grill to high.2. Thoroughly combine beef, spinach, Worcestershire, salt and pepper. If the meat starts to warm up (from your hands) put it back in the fridge, you need to keep it chilled. Measure out 4 oz balls of beef mixture.3. Roll into a ball then flatten into a thin patty on top of wax paper, about 1/4″ high and roughly 5″ in diameter. On half of the patties place 1 oz of cheese.4. On to each cheese-topped patty, flip a second patty to cover the cheese. Pinch the edges together forming a swell in the middle. Re-cover with wax paper and refrigerate at least 10 minutes.5. Grill chilled patties five minutes on first side, then flip, grill another two minutes. Serve on your favorite bun with sauteed onions.

My husband and I tried this once, and the cheese oozed out all over the coals. I'm going to try freezing them a little before they go on the grill. I have a feeling I'll end up putting cheese on top of the patty though....never enough. sigh.
Lon
2009-04-02 08:45:00
EMC - I shared your thoughts exactly!  There's not much to say about the urge to put cheese on top of the patty, I fought the urge to sample the real deal.  I think the trick is to make sure you put enough cheese inside to fulfill your cheese desire =)As for the coating the grill issue.  Yes, definitely chill your burgers first (I wouldn't freeze them though).  Also make sure to really pinch the top and bottoms together.  Then when you start grilling them, do not move them for a good 4-5 minutes after placing them.  This will give the edges enough time to cook through, so that when you flip, the cheese won't come out.

Since the first time I saw one of these, it's the only way I'll make cheeseburgers. Try blue cheese. Or, if you're in the mood for a salty, tangy wonder, try feta. And, of course, for the ultimate in decadence, use the middle of the brie. (I love the rind, but not in a burger.) The possibilities are basically endless.If you don't want spinach, one other way to avoid dried out beef and still get a wonderful flavor is to add lightly caramelized onion to the beef. Or, my favorite, lightly sauteed diced mushrooms. Just enough liquid still in them to moisten the meat, but the flavor addition is wonderful. (FWIW, while I love roasted red pepper on my burgers, it didn't come out well when added to the meat.) Just make sure you don't saute either the mushrooms or the onions so much that all the liquid cooks out, which defeats the purpose.
Lon
2009-04-04 07:46:00
Motherzucker - Thanks! These are really helpful tips.  I love the idea of either the onions or mushrooms.  Especially onions, since so many burger places seem to use them while cooking to add flavor and they usually stay quite moist.

2009 DIFFA's Dining by Design: Table Hop & Taste
CONTENT
We told you we were going to the Design Industries Foundation Fighting AIDS (DIFFA) Dining by Design event: Table Hop & Taste....and we did attend, of course. It was really a lot of fun, all these great tablescapes to look at and lots of great stuff to taste, a treat for the eyes and the tummy. Lon and Carol were my fabulous dates...Our first taste was a Veal Meatball by Icon. It was just that, a veal meatball, nothing special. It could have been better if it wasn't cold already, but it's always difficult serving this way.Our next stop was the L'ecole table, where they presented a beautiful amuse of cured salmon, curried parsnip, croutons, and salmon roe. The flavors and textures were each vital to making this one of the clear winners of the event.Paris Commune had four different pastries, each puff pastry with a different filling. These were rather disappointing since none were particularly pretty, and the puff pastry was under-baked. The one with duck confit, and the one with braised lamb skimped on the filling, to the point where you could not tell what the filling was.Ilili had cute little grape leaves, a bit extra acidic, but Lon loved them.The little flatbreads with ground lamb were also tasty.But the three of us swooned over the Beef Dumplings in Yogurt. The meat was tender and juicy, spiced and seasoned wonderfully, submerged in a thick yogurt with an herby oil. The whole shooter was served hot too.North Square had the table next to Ilili, where they served cute little cups of Shrimp Cocktail with Avocado and Mango, with pretzels. It was pretty standard.Carol's favorite was the Tuna Tartare in Limestone Tartlets, by Kittichai. The candied tuna had a nice bounce and texture, but it was too sweet for my taste, but Lon agreed with Carol, and they went back for more.All three of us are cheese fanatics so of course we enjoyed the Murray's Cheese stop. The fresh Asiago with apricots, and the Castel Rosso with Charcoal Crackers were great.Estiatorio Milos definitely put out the biggest spread. We each walked away with piled plates of simple but well executed Mediterranean salads. The roasted peppers weren't peeled but they were very tasty.They used excellent mozzarella to pair with cherry tomatoes and olives.I thought a few pieces of octopus were tough but Lon didn't notice.I've been unhealthy lately, so I appreciated the tomato and feta salad. We also loved the dips with pita, hummus, yogurt, and roasted pepper/feta. You could really make a nice lunch out of this spread.I liked the Pane Rustico Insalata by Bella Cucina. The Toasted pane rustico flatbread is ultra thin so it breaks really easily, but to my surprise (since I'm not an olive lover), I loved the strong tapenade dressed with fresh arugula with a slice of Parmesan.L.A. Burdick, a chocolate company, ended up being our favorite. We tried all seven chocolates and an incredible hot chocolate, and all agreed that this was a fabulous company. The Richelieu - Cherry, flavored dark chocolate bonbon with hint of vanilla, garnished with dried morello cherry, was mine and Carol's favorite.Lon's favorite was the Pave Glacee, cube of rich, velvety, dark chocolate gianduja mixed with hints of saffron and cognac.The Pain a la Grecque by Dandoy Biscuits are just biscuits with pearl sugar, nothing interesting really.Oddly, Tribeca Grill served desserts. It was an amazing looking spread but they looked better than they tasted, mostly because they were generally too sweet.The three of us tried nearly every one and all favored the Dulce de Leche, the only one that was more flavor than sugar, ooh that caramelized goodness.In our experience, the food at these types of events seem to be an after-thought. Yes, even when it's called a food event or tasting. This time, I'm actually impressed. All three of us enjoyed several different tables and left full and happy. Presentations were great (as you can see) and I hope we get invited again next year!View the full Flickr set.

Salt
CONTENT
Justin asked about the difference between kosher and table salt. I described the flavor difference and uses. He further inquired about what actually makes them different. I wasn't sure and guessed (openly) that perhaps it had to do with the manufacturing. Maybe one was mined and the other was evaporated from water? w00t! I was basically correct (more details below).A few days later, I was talking to Louis and his mom about various salt substitutes and how Jessica and I have so many varieties of salts and salt alternatives. And in further coincidence, Laura and David were discussing (in front of me) how the high melting point of salt raises the boiling point of water. All of that adds up to: me writing this blog post.Growing up, we barely used salt. My mom cooks with little, if any salt. Her logic was always that kosher meat (we were raised kosher) has a high sodium level, so additional salt isn't necessary. She's half right. The sodium level is high (salt is used in the koshering process, hence the term \"Kosher Salt\" -- that's the type of salt used during the process). However, not all dishes have meat in them and those other dishes need salt!Years after moving out, I started using salt in my cooking, slowly at first. I took the advice from chefs on TV. I don't use nearly as much as restaurants, but much more than my mom. It takes time to re-tune your palette. If you're curious about how your sense of taste and smell work, check out this great article on the Physiology of Taste. Here's a relevant excerpt:Salt is one of, if not THE, key tastes chefs rely on. And it seems like a worthwhile discussion. There are three key salts we always have at home.Kosher Salt (a.k.a. kashering or koshering salt) - This is our \"go to\" salt. We use it in almost every dish. It is a large-grained, pure (additive-free) salt (Sodium Chloride). The lack of other chemicals allows the salt to adjust flavor without adding other flavors. The large granule size has several benefits. First, it dissolves relatively slowly. So you can still feel the salt as you eat the final product, most people don't realize how that adds a subtlety to dishes. Second, you don't need as much of it to equally season the food. Third, the large granules are actually less dense than table salt. So it doesn't taste as salty if you get a piece of it in your mouth whole. (weird, huh?) By far our favorite brand (after taste testing) is Morton's.Table Salt (Iodized, a.k.a. refined salt) - This salt is perfect for the three Bs: baking, boiling, and brining. While any salt should be fine (chemically-speaking) for baking, the ideal salt will have been ground very fine. Salt takes time to dissolve in liquid and even more time to dissolve in baking mixtures (even Morton's suggests avoiding coarse salts in baking). A coarse grain salt (as is often found with sea and kosher salts) will result in an unevenly seasoned mixture. Of course coarse salts are great for topping baked goods.Table salt is also our choice when boiling pasta. Salting the water for boiling pasta is critical, as that is the primary point when pasta absorbs liquid and flavor. If the water is not salted, the pasta won't be either. Further, salted water boils at a higher temperature (how much higher varies based on the amount of dissolved salt), this helps ensure a proper cooking time when you follow box instructions. And, a third reason, table salt is roughly half the price of kosher salt, so I don't mind using it in larger amounts.Sea Salt - With it's wide, flat flaky shape, sea salt is the ideal salt for topping food at the table, or at least after cooking. The flavor of sea salt is very delicate and it will dissipate readily during cooking. Also, it's a pet peeve of mine when people put sea salt in grinders, such people are wasting the ideal salt shape! Sea salt is vastly more expensive than table and kosher salts, so it's use should be somewhat sparing. Top your favorite breads or olive oils. Also season high quality meats and poultry at the table with sea salt. And obviously, sea salt is ideal over your favorite fish.I should probably answer (officially) Justin's original question: how are these salts produced. Simply, most food-quality salt is evaporated from water. while industrial-quality salt is often mined from salt mines.Generally, table salt is evaporated from water that is piped through salt mines. As the water runs through the mines, salt dissolves into the water and is later evaporated. It is processed down to a fine size, in a cubic shape. Iodine and anti-caking agents are added to the salt before boxing for shipping.Kosher salt is usually evaporated from sea water, but may be mined. Either way it is processed to remove all impurities. Some companies, such as Morton's add anti-caking agents. During processing the salt is usually moved to keep the shape irregular and have many facets.Sea salt is always evaporated from sea water, usually by the sun, in large man-made pools. True sea salt should not be processed. It should contain additional minerals, naturally found in sea water and should not contain an anti-caking agent. Sea salt should taste like the sea, and should be less salty (lighter tasting) than both table and kosher salt.I'll briefly mention rock salt. Rock salt, usually used for salting streets and sidewalks, is a mined salt, that is mostly unprocessed. It is much coarser than any of the aforementioned salts, and contains inedible minerals. I mention it here, because it does have a culinary use. Salt lowers the freezing point of water, therefore, mixing rock salt (or any salt) into water will allow the water to stay liquid at a lower temperature. When making ice cream the old fashioned, churn-method, the bucket must be surrounded by freezing water, that is still liquid. Adding rock salt to the water outside the bucket allows this to occur.While we don't keep Potassium Chloride at home, it is the main salt substitute. People who have medically-diagnosed, sodium issues may have been advised by their doctor to avoid or reduce sodium intake. Potassium Chloride is the typical way to do it. There are various brands on the market that are completely without sodium (such as No Salt, Nu-Salt, and Morton Salt Substitute), as well as a few with some sodium (such as Morton Lite Salt). First of all, it does taste salty, but also a bit weird. Second, this stuff is not good for you, and there are numerous cases of death due to Potassium Chloride (usually in young children or senior citizens) doses that are not unreasonably large. So, again, speak to your doctor before considering salt substitute.Well, while not as immediate a threat as salt substitute, eating too much sodium is not good for most people. Humans need several hundred milligrams of sodium per day and can tolerate several thousand. However, most people consume much more than that. It is usually due to eating processed foods. So while salt tastes good, too much of a good thing is bad for you.If you cook with processed foods, you should consider reducing the salt you add to dishes. For instance, even low sodium chicken broth or bouillion (store bought, obviously) has far more salt than homemade chicken broth. Ketchup has lots of salt, processed meats (most store bought deli meats, sausages, etc.) are high in sodium, etc. So keep your eyes out. Or better yet, avoid processed foods.Well that wraps it up for my salt article. If you'd like to continue reading on salt here are some great reference pages online:Jessica started reading the New York Times Bestseller, Salt by Mark Kurlansky, but it's more about the history of salt then the uses.Just for fun, check out what else you can do with salt.

Hello LonI'm so pleased you posted on salt.We could all benefit with knowing more about it. We avoid cooking with it whenever we can, and just add to the table if anyone wants it. The salt we use is Himalayan pink salt.I would be interested to hear what you think on this.Here's the link.http://www.himalayansalt.info/himalayan_salt_health_benefits.html
Lon
2009-03-30 09:48:00
Lesley, we're pretty sure we haven't had Himalayan salt.  We do have Alaea at home (Hawaiian Red Salt).  There are many natural salts on the market, which are in the same family as sea salt.  They are mined salts, which are fairly unprocessed, they retain a blend of natural minerals found along with the salt.In addition to having varied colors and tastes, due to those minerals, these other salts are thought to have health benefits by some holistic healers.  I'm not sure if there's proof, but they are cool salts anyway!

interesting point, but very important oversight...POPCORN!  The best salt for popcorn is pickling salt or any other very fine grained salt.  This helps distribute among the pieces much better.Also, I would add another note.  When salting to taste it is better to salt at the end of a cooking process for soups/sauces b/c while any liquid reduces, salt is never part of the evaporation process, so its proportion of a flavor profile will concentrate as the sauce tightens.  This should be distinguished from using salt to aid in the cooking process (like sweating onions, etc.).

"the high melting point of salt raises the boiling point of water"no! chemistry 101: boiling point elevation is a colligative property.  it has nothing to do with the melting point of salt or even anything else about the salt itself! you could add an equal quantity of *any* solute (potassium chloride, sugar, calcium carbonate - anything!) and it would have the same effect.  robert wolke's first book, what einstein told his cook has a great explanation of the many uses of salt.
Lon
2009-03-30 13:03:00
Bill - Good points.  I haven't tried pickling salt in popcorn but I always use table salt, because it is finer.Also, I completely agree about when to taste for seasoning.Julie - Yes that is true.  Actually, to be completely honest, I was paraphrasing, I believe that is what they were discussing, although it's possible David didn't remember why it was altered.  And I was only listening in on the conversation, plus he's in elementary school.

Culinary Flashback: Chocolate Cake - Two Ways
CONTENT
One of the more popular photo sets in our Flickr stream continues to be a post from several years ago, one that never made it to FoodMayhem. It was called \"Chocolate Cake - Two Ways\".I had made a large yellow cake, and cut it up into pieces. Some hexagonal pieces and some triangular pieces.The triangular pieces were filled with strawberry preserves between the layers, coated in chocolate, then topped with dried cranberries.The hexagonal pieces were received a luscious cream cheese filling, was also coated in chocolate, and was then topped with frozen snickers. After that I drizzled more chocolate over the snickers.I was reminded of that culinary adventure watching Dinner: Impossible last night, when Chef Robert Irvine mentioned he was making a master sauce (a demi glace) which would then be turned into two sauces. Apparently I found a master cake, that turned into two mini pieces of heaven.

Jack's Stir Brew Coffee
CONTENT
I'm always trying new coffee spots so I asked a few of my girlfriends to meet me at Jack's Stir Brew Jack's Stir Brew yesterday. It's a cute little place with some benches outside, which we took advantage of. Despite the line, we were in and out of there quickly, paying reasonable prices for organic fair trade coffee and local organic milks. I did think the Iced Coffee was a little weak, but I still liked it enough to take a walk back there this morning to try a hot coffee. I liked the hot coffee more because it was stronger, but both were flavorful without the burnt or acidic qualities I avoid.If Jack's was closer to me, I'd be a regular. Besides the coffee, there are some cute firemen next door.

Tangy Chinese Sauce
CONTENT
Jessica picked up some of the fluffy fish balls with pork centers, as well as cuttlefish balls, during a recent trip to Flushing. She had the idea to eat them with a spicy sauce. I took it upon myself to fulfill that desire. Well, even though there's a good amount of spice in this sauce, it came out more tangy because the vinegar and sugar really balanced the heat. It is delicious.While there are lots of ingredients, it's minimal work. Honestly, if I weren't writing this recipe, I would've made this same sauce without measuring any of it. And, it's a fast sauce, just think, you're 15 minutes away from having deliciousness.Tangy Chinese Sauce~makes about 1/2 cupIngredientsInstructions

Sophia - We LOVE those fish balls.  I like all types of fish cakes (even since I was a kid and my served me gefilte fish).  Jessica is not usually a fan though, but she loves these.  These fish balls are fluffy and have a small center of pork.  The flavor is not overwhelming, just a light fish flavor, and then a bit of minced pork in the middle.  They easily take on whatever flavor they're with, so perfect for this or hot pot.For a full answer about Szechuan red peppercorn and other pepper, check out the post we wrote.Ducky - You've got to bring the Chinese...

I have some treats that would benefit from the flavors you have listed, but do you have any subs for rock sugar? And what do you think of apple cider vinegar instead of white?
Lon
2009-03-27 23:31:00
EMC- You can definitely use white sugar instead of of rock sugar.  I'm not sure of the amount off the top of my head, but I'd probably guess about 1 or 2 tsp.  Just taste for sweetness.As for vinegar, I wouldn't sub apple cider vinegar, except as a last resort.  Actually, I think black or red vinegar would be best, white was my substitute, since we don't have either of the others.If you have sushi vinegar that might be ok, just cut back on the sugar, since sushi vinegar is a bit sweet.  You could also try white wine vinegar.

Fresh Apple Cake
CONTENT
When I have guests over, I like to make pretty cakes with frosting, a meringue topping, or glaze. For myself, I like things less sweet, and actually prefer simple cakes or quickbreads without any adornments. I think it's the texture of cake that I'm truly addicted to. Add a good cup of coffee, and I'm like a puppy with a new toy.I flipped around my cookbooks for an easy recipe that I had the ingredients for. This one was close enough, although I still needed to do a little substituting. The nutmeg is a bit strong for me, but it still satisfied my craving.Fresh Apple Cake~adapted from Fresh Apple Cake in Perfect Cakes by Nick Malgieri1. Set rack in the middle of the oven. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Butter and flour 12-cup tube pan.2. Sift together flour, baking soda, nutmeg and cinnamon. Set aside.3. In a large bowl, whisk together eggs, just until broken. Whisk in sugar in a steady stream. Continue whisking for another minute, or until lightened. Whisk in oil in a slow stream, then vanilla.4. Use a rubber spatula to fold in flour mixture. Fold in apples, cranberries, and pecans.5. Scrape into prepared pan and bake for 1 hour, or until a toothpick comes out clean. Remove to a cooling rack and cool in pan for 5 minutes. Remove from pan and place on cooling rack, right-side-up to cool completely.

Mr. Tong's

My parent's have been renovating their house and it's almost done. I went to check it out and do a little shopping with my mom, so it was another good opportunity to try another restaurant in Queens. Mr. Tong's Mr. Tong's was chosen for it's convenient location near our Bed, Bath, & Beyond stop. The long narrow space doesn't look like much but the staff seamed eager.We started with nicely fried Potstickers, hot and not the slightest bit oily. The pork and veggie filling was flavorful, but the dipping sauce was bland. We asked for vinegar (the way my mom likes to eats her dumplings) and that was much better.They recommended the Mini Shanghai Wontons Soup (meal size serving, not soup size). While the wontons and the bits of veggies, mini dried shrimp, and shredded egg were all great, I could swear the soup was just plain water. This soup is traditionally very light but we agreed that they took \"light\" a little too far.

Lamb Pizzaiola Redux
CONTENT
Do you remember two weeks ago we made Wine-Braised Beef Shanks (which, by the way, was freakin' delicious)? And then that weekend, Jessica turned the left-overs into great Left-Over Pockets? Well, that meal had another life as well... I baked off one of FreshDirect's delicious par-baked ciabatta rolls, and then stuffed it with the beef, sauce, some sauteed onions, and then topped it with the gremolata. Oh, and of course, there was the mayo. It was awesome.It's kind of nice re-using wonderful dishes into new recipes. So tonight, we did it again. Yesterday, we had Lamb Pizzaiola over Grilled Polenta Cakes. The flavors of the dish made me think it would make a distinctive pizza.Also, we had some Perfect Pizza flour blend from King Arthur in the pantry. We had been itching to try it out. This was just the chance.I followed the recipe on the bag and in the spot where it said \"dough seasonings\" I added 1/2 tbsp. of Parsley and 1/2 tbsp. of Garlic Powder. Surprisingly the dough, which includes baking powder, takes two full teaspoons of active yeast. My typical recipe (that I love) only uses the more common 1.25 teaspoon. Just as King Arthur advertises, the dough was very roll-able and baked off quite chewy. However, in part, that is because I slightly undercooked it.To pull the recipe together, I sauced the dough with the Pizzaiola sauce. Then I sliced up pieces of the lamb and black olives to top the sauce. I also added sauteed red onion slices, corn niblets, plenty of finely shredded Parmesano-Reggiano, and shredded Fontina cheese (an Italian cheese that brought a distinctive taste and worked as a perfect alternative to Mozzarella). I baked it in a pre-heated 475 deg F. oven for just over 10 minutes.The flavors worked really well! I added the corn and red onions to bring back the flavors that the polenta cake added in the original dish.The black olives added a great dynamic by highlighting the olive oil flavors. Yum!

Oh oh oh, that sounds wonderful. A great use of leftovers! Pizza is one of those great things that can easily be lowbrow or highbrow.
EMC
2009-03-26 21:41:00
I love that you're using leftovers in entirely different creations with each of these meals. I always have a hard time with this because the spices or other components of the original dish seem to linger along with the leftovers. How do you counteract this? Or do you go with the prevailing tastes of the leftover meat?
Lon
2009-03-26 22:01:00
EMC- When using left-overs I wouldn't try to counter-act the original flavors, unless those flavors were bad.  Rather I try to heighten them and/or complement them.  As I mentioned in this pizza, the original dish was paired with a polenta cake, which had carmelized onions in it.  So for the pizza, I included corn niblets and carmelized onions on it.While I got carried away, often, just a little fresh salt and pepper can pep left-overs right back up!

Rocco's Pizza Joint
CONTENT
For a casual Sunday night get together, we ordered from Rocco's Pizza Joint Rocco's Pizza Joint. For 8 people, we got a Grandma Pie, a Sausage and Peppers Pie, a Baked Ziti with Broccoli, a Sausage and Meatballs Spaghetti, and a Turkey Meatball Parmigiana Hero. The delivery arrived in a reasonable amount of time and we quickly scarfed it all up.The favorite was definitely the Grandma Pie. We all enjoyed the very garlicky sauce on the puffy fluffy dough. It would have been even better if the bottom was a little crisp.

Lamb Pizzaiola
CONTENT
Inspired by a recipe for Wine-Braised Lamb Shanks on Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives (prepared at Giusti's Place), I created this recipe for lamb shanks. A little bit of spice and acid go a long way in my version. Their idea to serve the lamb with sauced, wet polenta inspired me to serve with a grilled polenta cake.This meal is great for dinner parties, as it can all be done ahead of time. The polenta can be done a day or two ahead of time, and the lamb just sits in the oven until you're ready to serve.Enjoy!Lamb Pizzaiola~makes 4 entreesIngredientsInstructions1. Brine shanks over night (at least 12 hours).2. Pre-heat oven to 350 deg F oven. Season shanks, dredge in flour, brown in oil and butter in a large saute pan.3. Remove browned lamb to 9″ x 13″ pan. Add lemon juice and 1 cup of wine.4. With oil remaining in saute pan, saute carrots, celery, and onion. Season with ground fennel seed, salt, and black pepper. After about 10 minutes, caramelize tomato paste. Stir in garlic. When well combined, deglaze with 1/2 cup of wine. Pour contents of pan over shanks.5. Season shanks with half of oregano; cover with tomato sauce; then remaining oregano. Cover pan with tented aluminum foil, make a one inch slit to vent steam, cook in oven for three hours.6. Serve with polenta. Garnish with Parmigiano-Reggiano.I followed Epicurious' Grilled Polenta recipe, with a few modifications. First, I substituted half the onion with red onion (rather than yellow), this gave awesome color. Second, I stirred 1/4 cup of the Parmesan into the polenta before cooling. And, third, I set mine in a 9″x9″ baking dish, because we don't own an 11″x7″ and it's close enough in size for my taste.Lots more pictures in the Flickr set.

Janet

What is the brine recipe?
Lon
2009-04-24 07:43:00
Jane - There are many brine recipes out there, and any of them would be fine here.  The most basic brine is simply salt-saturated water.  The typical formula is about 1 cup of salt to 1 gallon of water.  The second-most basic brine adds equal parts salt and sugar to the water.  Honestly, at this point, I don't remember which of these I did, but I suspect I likely did sugar and salt.  More flavorful brines may include aromatics such as herbs, spices, or aromatic veggies (carrots, celery, onions, etc.).You want to brine foods based on how dense the meat is.  So items like lamb need a long time, like 12 hours, whereas seafood usually only needs an hour.

Fried Tofu with Minced Pork in Spicy Garlic Sauce

This is a variation on Ma Po Tofu that my mom developed when I was a kid and it instantly became a household favorite. Me, my brother, and our cousins, requested it all the time. Now that I made it for Lon, he'll be requesting it too.Fried Tofu with Minced Pork in Spicy Garlic SauceIngredientsInstructions1. In a small bowl, stir together cornstarch and 1.5 tablespoons of water. Make sure it is completely dissolved. Set aside.2. Heat oil in a large skillet on medium heat.3. Mix 2/3 of the slurry into the pork and put it in the oil and break it up while cooking. Use a tablespoon of water to help break it up. Stir until cooked through and add soy sauce, garlic, sugar, and chili garlic sauce.4. Add tofu and 1 cup of water, and stir. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer.5. Cook uncovered for 10 minutes. Stir in remaining slurry and scallions and stir for 1 minute or until even consistency throughout.It's irresistible with rice -- you can't help but eat too much!

Wing Shoon Seafood Restaurant
CONTENT
Dim Sum has been disappointing in Manhattan but I'm still willing to keep on searching. This weekend, we tried Wing Shoon Seafood Restaurant Wing Shoon Seafood Restaurant, a ghetto looking place, even by Chinatown standards. If you can brave that, try not to use the bathroom. It was one of the worst I've seen and smelled, and is reason enough for me not to go again.If you're still reading, the food was decent, mostly smaller in flavor, bigger in size. The crystal shrimp dumplings were really packed with shrimp.

Jess,Thanks for your post on Wing Shoon. I used to live blocks away from this restaurant, so I am excited to see a review on it as well as curiosity about what made you trek down to that neighborhood? I'll say one thing that has been good about their dim sum over the years is the remarkable consistency in terms of size and flavor even dating back to the days when it was Wing Sing in the 90s. I don't think one can say the same about most dim sum restaurants in C-town.  Of course, that consistency extended to the bathroom as well!

Crawfish Étouffée
CONTENT
As I mentioned the other day in our post about Crawfish Gumbo, gumbo was the winner of the FoodMayhem Reader's Choice: Crawfish Season, receiving 35.7% of the votes. In second place, with 30.4% of the vote, was Crawfish Étouffée. Honestly, we were pretty disappointed that these two won. They're delicious dishes, but they're about as standard as it comes when using crawfish. The other choices were much more interesting.Unlike gumbo, I haven't made étouffée before. I have, however, eaten a good bit of it. One annoying thing is that there aren't many strict rules. Outside Louisiana, people use cream, in LA: no cream. Originally there were no tomatoes, however most recipes now include some tomato product, even cajun and creole chefs. Some cooks vehemently oppose butter, while others think it's critical. Some use blonde roux, some use dark roux, some avoid roux altogether. Frankly, it's hard to find a definition for what étouffée really is!So, here's how I approached the problem. Étouffée is so named for the style of cooking seafood. Unlike a quick cook-through, as done in gumbo (adding seafood at the end of cooking), étouffée braises the seafood, low and slow for at least 20 minutes, but some recipes go for 40-60 minutes. Étouffée is meant to be thick and rich. I assume this is why non-Louisianians add cream and why there is debate over the roux.My étouffée came out tasty, but way too wet. The color of the sauce was pretty accurate: a light orange. It was savory, due to my use of butter in the making of a blonde roux, but since I went with butter, I skipped any cream.I also had an idea to serve the étouffée in vol-au-vent, rather than over rice (the traditional way). This worked out really well. The little pastries are perfect serving containers: they're super rich and look beautiful. They're a perfect accompaniment for the étouffée.Because my étouffée was too wet, I'm not going to post a recipe. Normally, we'd try again, but because of how expensive the not-so-great crawfish is here, we're going to leave this one alone. Rather I'm just giving advice. And we will post a technique for creating these beautiful serving pastry.Étouffée AdviceVol-au-Vent TechniqueStep 1. Cut puff pastry into squares. Make cuts, like seen in picture below. Cut so two opposite points meet, and the other two don't quite meet.Step 2. Lift the two side, where the points were cut through.Step 3. Fold across both sides.Step 4. Press corners into opposite corners.Step 5. Bake at 400 degrees F for 10-15 minutes or until golden and puffed up.Step 6. Plate and fill with Etouffee. Serve immediately.

I saw that Paula Deen episode as well, and to be honest, yours looks way more tasty. Then again, I am usually skeptical of the "talent" on the Food Network. Moving on.We did happen to find some excellent fresh crawfish, so I think I might have to play around with the shears shucking process to see how to best maximize the meat extraction. I'd really like to try out your gumbo process but risotto sounds so tempting.

Oikos Organic Yogurt
CONTENT
Greek yogurt is all the hype these days (a long time actually but still going strong), so no big surprise that Stonyfield Farms wanted in on the action.Their new line, Oikos, is organic Greek yogurt, available in plain, vanilla, blueberry, and honey. It's fat free but you wouldn't be able to tell because it's thick and creamy, with more flavor than most.I love it! The problem is, it's also much more expensive. At $2.79 (price near me), it's not really affordable in daily doses. I was already stretching at $1.99 for my beloved Fage. I usually alternate days with some cheaper ones like Trader Joe's yogurts and Chobani as well.If you're not price sensitive (I'm not sure who that would be these days), give Oikos a try. It is quite delicious!

It tasted very good, but different.Blonde Duck, you must try it!Pearl, the oikos is different from their regular. Greek yogurt is made by straining, which makes it thicker. I love Fage (how many times have I said this already, haha) so definitely give it a try!EMC, omg, I would totally buy it for 89 cents.Tina W, I could live with that price too, but geez, it's so expensive here. =(

Crawfish Gumbo
CONTENT
Crawfish Gumbo was, by a good margin, the winner of the FoodMayhem Reader's Choice: Crawfish Season, receiving 35.7% of the votes. There are many recipes already available online for Crawfish Gumbo, so my goal was to write a definitive guide. I've made gumbo quite a few times in the past, so I have a few tips to share. This post is more about the tips than anything else.The number one tip I have for you is (Tip #1): Don't attempt to make gumbo unless you're planning to spend the whole day making it!Actually, it takes more than a day. I had to find the spices, hunt for a decent andouille sausage, and buy and shuck the crawfish. All of these are extremely time consuming.When choosing a gumbo recipe there are many available. It seems they can be divided into two categories: with okra and without okra. Okra is a seasonal vegetable, so it's good to have a back-up plan. Okra is a super-starchy, very sticky vegetable (gooey, actually). It also has a woodsy flavor. Louisianians go for filé powder as a substitute when okra is out of season. Filé is dried, ground sassafras leaves. While it's not sticky, it is woodsy in taste, and it has thickening power.My gumbo preference has strongly been to cook with okra -- it just doesn't seem like gumbo without the stuff. What I did this time was inspired by an idea I saw to use filé powder as a table seasoning. Tip #2: Decide whether you want an okra-included gumbo recipe.Gumbo is a soup, or at least a stew. It is meant to be wet, so you're going to need plenty of liquid. My recipe (included below) uses 6 cups of liquid, and probably could've taken more, if I was going to cook it longer. Many recipes like to use water, or at least suggest substituting water if stock is not available. If you're going to go through the hassle and devote the time to make gumbo, then heed my Tip #3: Make and use crawfish stock as at least half the liquid.Crawfish are truly difficult to deal with. First, in NYC, the mecca of ingredients, I could only find pre-cooked, pre-seasoned, frozen crawfish. In the past, I have found raw, frozen crawfish. Supposedly due to bad weather, the 2009 season is not very good, which may be why only one store (in Chinatown) out of the six that I checked had any crawfish. Sad. Second, 10 pounds of crawfish yielded about 1.4 pounds of tail meat and it took almost two hours to shuck them.Third, the price didn't seem bad at $2.30 per pound, but a fair amount of that went towards the fact that they were cleaned, seasoned, and pre-cooked. And if you consider the yield, the net price of the tail meat was $16.43 per pound -- pricey! For that price, I can get some awesome prawn or lobster. So this is definitely a treat. Tip #4: Unless you're near a local source, crawfish are expensive and hard to find; either way they're difficult to deal with; so, don't screw up and don't plan on doing this often.By the way, I'm going to comment on using pre-cooked seafood. Jessica and I HATE using pre-cooked seafood. Most seafood cooks very quickly, so cooking it twice is a sure fire way to ruin it. Crawfish is one of the very few exceptions-here's why: you must cook the crawfish prior to shelling them anyway. So the only downside to buying them pre-cooked, is that you'll have to use once-cooked shells to make your stock and your stock is likely to not be as strong. I am sad that I could only get pre-seasoned crawfish; but it was red pepper, so not so bad.Speaking of being difficult to deal with... peeling crawfish is a pain! Most resources online advise twisting the tail to separate it from the body. And there are various techniques for removing the tail meat from the shell. However, none of them work as well as the technique I've devised. After working through 10 pounds of the mud bugs, I assure you this is the best way. Tip #5: To shell crawfish, first: hold the body with one hand and the tail with your other. Drive your thumb (of the hand holding the body) into the back of the body shell (just before the tail starts) to crack it a bit, then twist the tail and pull back gently to separate the tail. The goal is to keep as much of the body meat attached to the tail as possible. Second: hold the tail in all your fingers and press it simultaneously along sides until you hear it crack. The goal is to crack it lengthwise (from where the body was to the tail fan). Then holding each side of the tail with each hand pull back to rip the sides apart. While not perfect, this seemed to be the most effective method.Okra are annoying as well (is nothing easy in gumbo?). They can be prickly on the outside and they're very starchy, gooey, and sticky inside. Once sliced, they stick to everything. If not handled correctly they can make your gumbo worse, rather than better (the obvious goal). Here's a good guide on how to clean okra correctly (as shown in the image above). Tip #6: Cut off the tip and top of the okra. Cut the top in a curved shape (similar to removing the top of a strawberry). There is a stem-like part that runs down the center, you want to remove the parts that are only the stem, they taste bad.I'll mention this, not as a tip, because I'm not confident, but I think that when the okra get too ripe and get bigger, the seeds inside turn brown (as in the image to the right). You can still eat these, but I think they're too rough. So the one or two like this, I just chucked.The second half of cleaning okra is washing them. Most resources online recommend rubbing the okra against each other to clean them. I've got a great technique here in Tip #7: After trimming the okra, put them into a mesh strainer (don't over-crowd it), and under running cold water, shake the okra violently. Not only will the okra rub against each other, but the mesh will act like sand paper and remove any rough spots. Do this for about two minutes. Then dry in a sandwich of paper towels.Now here's another tip about the okra. When you cook okra, the starches seem to activate and will become stringy. I've seen some dishes where it looks like a cob web of okra starch. Personally, I find this gross and it will make your gumbo nasty. Tip #8: To avoid stringy, starchy okra, pre-cook the sliced okra in a frying pan with about one tablespoon of white vinegar per 1/3 pound of okra over medium-low heat. Keep the okra moving and cook until the okra just starts to stick to the pan and the vinegar is gone.Gumbo is not gumbo without a roux. Roux is the base for many sauces in French cooking, so I expect most chefs have made one before. It's just fat + flour, cooked together. Real Mac & Cheese has roux. Roux is qualified based on how long it's cooked, and therefore how dark the color of the roux is. Really, all you're doing is frying the flour. Overtime it will turn from blond (very light) to peanut butter-colored (medium) to chocolate colored (dark) to coffee colored (very dark). Different gumbos usually call for anywhere from medium to very dark (never light or very light). The darker the roux the stronger the taste and more powerful the thickening action. I feel strongly that very dark is critical for roux. Tip #9: To get a perfect very dark roux for your gumbo cook the roux by itself until it is dark (chocolate colored), then add your trinity. It will continue cooking for a bit becoming very dark. If you cook it very dark before adding trinity, it will over cook.Cooking roux is time consuming and can not be rushed. There is a joke in gumbo cooking, where the first step is to marinate the chef. Trust me, if you sip a beer while stirring your roux, you'll be plastered by the time it's done. My roux took about 30-40 minutes. And you can not walk away from it for more than about 20 seconds or it will burn. Tip #10: The best roux is achieved by having a very consistent color throughout. Keep in mind that the hotspots on your pot will cook the roux much faster; and keep in mind that the flour will constantly fall out of suspension and sink to the bottom of the pot. You must stir thoroughly, scraping the bottom of the pot, at least every 20 seconds. And don't stir too violently, or you'll splash yourself with scalding oil.Here's the thing about roux, it stays well in the freezer (as kind of a sludge). So you can stop it earlier in the cooking process (take into account carry-over cooking), once it cools down, store it in plastic ware and it will solidify. Then you can melt it back down and use it. But, while it's hot, you're best not letting it continue cooking. The next step is to saute your veggies, but you won't have time to cut them while stirring the roux. Tip #11: Mise-en-place!!! Do all your cutting and prep work prior to starting your roux.Cajun cooking relies on the Holy Trinity: celery, green bell pepper, and onion. Many cuisines have base aromatics. In French cuisine it's the mirepoix (celery, carrots, and onion); in Latin cuisine it's sofrito (varies a bit, but typically garlic, red bell pepper, and onion). Tip #12: If you hunt for gumbo recipes, make sure it includes the trinity, otherwise something is weird.If you've ever watched Chef Emeril Lagasse cook, you know he's got a spice blend. Well, most cajun chefs have one. It's because their recipes almost all call for creole or cajun seasoning. While they vary a bit, there are some common ingredients. Tip #13: Mix up a cajun spice blend and use it in your recipe. Exclude salt so that you can control salt levels. Include Onion Powder, Garlic Powder, Paprika, Oregano, Basil, Cayenne Powder, White Pepper, and Black Pepper.Oh, by the way, gumbo should be salty. Towards the end of the cooking process, taste for seasoning. Make sure it's got plenty of salt.People include all sorts of proteins in their gumbo (except for one classic version that is vegetarian). Most non-veg. versions include sausage and the classic type is andouille. Andouille is a smoked, pork sausage with a truly distinctive taste. I can't imagine gumbo without it. That is why I tried to find a decent one. The one I found, at Whole Foods, was mediocre, but it did meet one requirement I had: no nitrites or nitrates! Those chemicals ruin the taste for me. Tip #14: Include andouille sausage and try to find a good one. It's smoked (pre-cooked) so, if you can, taste before you buy.Finally, this is not so-much a tip, but more a note about the specifics of what I did. Since my recipe calls for beer, I decided to use a New Orleans beer. And I found one at Whole Foods called Blackened Voodoo from Dixie Brewing. According to the container (and the web site), \"Dixie Brewery is the last remaining survivor of New Orleans' once flourishing Brewing Industry.\" While it get's a B- on Beer Advocate, it has a decent taste, it's native, and it is pretty dark (at least for a lager). So I feel like it was a good pick for my gumbo.Ok, ok, I'll shut up now and make with the gumbo... ooo wee!Crawfish Gumbo~makes 8-10 entree servingsIngredients3 tsp. Cajun Seasoning (cayenne pepper, onion powder, garlic powder, black pepper, white pepper, paprika, oregano, basil)Dressing:InstructionsIn a heavy-bottom dutch oven, over low heat, combine oil and flour. Stir continuously for about 30-40 minutes (crazy, huh?) until a milk-chocolate color is achieved.I served the extra family style.

1.  Looks amazing and classic.2.  I can't believe you didn't go with the etouffee.  The I feel like your readers elected George Bush.3.  For all shellfish I use kitchen shears.  So fast on shells and no scratches on my fingers.4.  Alton Brown has what looks like a great no-stir recipe for rue.5.  I think rue is way over-rated as a flavor.  Whenever I've tried to make it, it is too powerful for any stew.  Makes it hard to enjoy the taste of the more important ingredients.

Wonders - I personally was hoping for the stuffed clam.  Oh well..Bill G - We're doing the etouffee as well, it should be up today or tomorrow.  Remember top twoHere's the thing about no-stir roux (a.k.a. oven roux): commercial kitchens toast the flour on its own to bring out the nutty flavor and jump-start the roux process.  It requires much less attention (just move the flour every 20 minutes, as opposed to every 20 seconds).  However, it requires much longer.  A dark toast will take a couple of hours.  Further, once the flour is done, you then need to cook it in fat in the pan to bring it together, that takes at least another 5-10 minutes (with stirring).  So, the process make a lot of sense if you're making huge quantities, but there's not a lot of benefit for one pot recipes.In regard to flavor, I don't totally disagree with you.  Roux is really not an exceptional flavor.  However, it is unique and definitely makes certain dishes, like gumbo or bechamel.  Stews are supposed to have powerful flavors, I think any stew should easily hold up the flavor of a roux.Bill & EMC - I can't imagine trying to work over crawfish with sheers.  First of all you would lose some of the meat in the body without the twisting.  Secondly, they're so small, smaller than shrimp, so it would require such precision, it would take even longer!  If you do try it and figure out a good technique let us know!Pearl - Broadly speaking, the ingredients distinguish gumbo from other stews.  Cajun spice blends, crawfish, andouille sausage, okra, roux, all very gumbo-esque.

Crawfish are much more appealing when they are out of the shell.    That being said, delish dish!  Oh and totally agreed that those okra juices can be just too much if they're left in the stew too long.  We like to add them towards the end, but it your trick is something new to try.

Hey, not bad. I live in Louisiana, and it bugs me when people throw a little cayenne pepper or red pepper into a bland recipe and call it Cajun. It looks like you did your research before making it.I've never met anybody that put diced tomatoes in gumbo before, but it may just be where I live. Diced tomatoes are in etouffee.My family doesn't like okra in our gumbo. It is traditional, but it tends to make the gumbo slimy.Crawfish get easier to peel with practice. I've never peeled ones that had been cooked and frozen, though. Most of my peeling experience is right after a crawfish boil. You'd better peel quick or you'll go hungry!
Lon
2009-04-02 21:12:00
Anon - Thanks for the local feedback, I really appreciate it!  I've seen so many different recipes for gumbo, and most I saw include some type of tomato product.  But I agree that many don't.  Gumbo is just such a loose term.One of my dreams is to go to a real crawfish boil.  I've heard about side of the road boils where you pay by the pound and just eat eat eat.  I'd be there in a heart beat... if I lived close by.In regards to okra being slimy, I hear ya.  Try the vinegar technique I described and let us know if that helps avoid the slime.

Billy's Bakery
CONTENT
Melinda, an old co-worker of Lon's , brought us an assortment of cupcakes from Billy's Bakery Billy's Bakery, a place their old office frequented. She obviously knows the way to our hearts.Lon remembers their cupcakes being better before, but this time we were pretty disappointed. The Banana Cupcake was so dense and gummy, with an ultra sweet frosting.The Chocolate Cupcakes were powdery, disintegrating in your mouth, giving a dry feeling. The frosting tastes like supermarket chocolate frosting.The Carrot Cupcake was too sweet for me but at least the cake was moist and Lon was able to eat it.The Red Velvet was also moist. I did sneak a taste, even though I'm allergic to food coloring. The cream cheese frosting on this one was most acceptable for me, a little tang to cut the sweet, although I'd really like it to still be less sweet.

Don't you wish they made red velvet cake the old fashion way, with beet juice. It wouldn't look as red, but it would be pretty great. I have tried a few things from there. How do you like it compared to Magnolia? My favorite cupcake are from Chicklacious dessert club or the pistachio cupcake from sugar Sweet Sunshine.

The frosting is uber sweet and feels grainy.I've yet to try chikalicious and I had sugar sweet sunshine once and can't really remember it.Pearl, I haven't tried Sprinkles but my cousin will be moving to LA so maybe I'll ask her to bring me some on one of her trips back here.

Maurizio closed and Da Andrea Da Andrea opened up in it's place. I actually remembered going to Da Andrea, at their former West Village location, many years ago (about 7 or 8 years, I think). I couldn't be certain ( I have a terrible memory, which is the original reason I started this blog) but I remembered that the food was good.We met Melinda there at 6:30pm last night, where there was a 10 minute wait. I was glad to see that the restaurant was well lit and I could see all the dishes passing by. Once we ordered, food came very quickly and always piping hot! We started with these Flat Buns, baked to order, soft, puffy, and doughy. While these came out hot, right out of the oven, the Parma proscuitto came out a little too chilled. As they came to room temperature, they tasted much better. The huge platter is perfect for sharing.

Dark Chocolate Cupcakes with Mocha Mascarpone Frosting
CONTENT
Borrowing a little here and a little there, and with a few tweaks, I created these scrumptious cupcakes. When I made the Matcha Green Tea Cupcakes, I had so much fun making two sizes that I decided to do that again.Dark Chocolate Cupcakes with Mocha Mascarpone Frosting ~makes 12 regular sized cupcakes and 24 mini cupcakes*Note: You'll need to start the frosting the day before you want these cupcakes.IngredientsFrostingCakeInstructionsStart Frosting - 1. Sift into a large bowl, cocoa powder and espresso powder.2. Bring 1/2 cup heavy cream to a boil. Pour over cocoa and espresso in a slow stream while whisking until dissolved.3. Add remaining 1/4 cup cream and sugar and stir until dissolved. Cover and chill overnight.The next day, make cupcakes - 4. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line muffin tins with paper cups. Dissolve cocoa in water. Let stand until cool.5. In a stand mixer, cream butter and sugar together until light and fluffy, Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Add vanilla.6. In a separate bowl, combine flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Add into creamed mixture alternating with sour cream. Beat in cocoa mixture.7. Spoon into prepared muffin tins. Bake for 10 minutes for minis, 15 minutes for regular sized cupcakes, or until toothpick comes out clean. (Bake separately so that you don't open the oven while the bigger ones are still baking.) Let cool for 10 minutes in the tin, then remove to wire rack to finish cooling.Finish Frosting - 8. In a mixer, start mascarpone and chilled cocoa mixture on low until smooth. Increase to medium speed and beat until medium firm peaks (about 2 minutes). Do not overbeat. It will curdle. Frost your cupcakes! Keep these refrigerated before serving.More pictures in the Flickr Set.

Vatan... I'm stuffed!
CONTENT
Bill, Justin, Steve, and I just ate at Vatan Vatan. It's a prix fixe, Vegetarian Indian restaurant in Murray Hill. And I feel like I'm about to explode from the amount of food I ate. It was worth it!The outside is totally unassuming, a sign and a door. The entry hallway is the same. As you reach the end of the hallway, the restaurant interior becomes visible... wow! It's like walking into a different world. A sky-like image painted on the 20-something foot ceiling. Faux trees of various types climb the walls. And in the back a huge statue of Ganesha, the Indian god of arts, sciences, intelligence, and wisdom. There is an upstairs area with regular tables. Downstairs, there are separate booths, where patrons remove their shoes and sit into the raised floors.The service was impeccable, as is often the case in Indian restaurants. Our waiter explained clearly how the service works. We can order drinks, charged per drink. In the mean time they will bring a round of appetizers, then a round of entrees, then a round of desserts. At any point we can request more of anything. All of the food is \"all you can eat\". Even though drinks are charged additionally, he advised us not to drink too much, even of the water, because we need to save room for the food!Steve and Justin had been to Vatan before and repeated our waiter's advice about the drinks. Nevertheless, I wanted to try their Mango Lassi. It was a good move! First of all, it was the best lassi I've had. It was incredibly smooth, nice and thick, and not too sweet. Secondly, lots of the food had solid spice, so I was happy to have the yogurty drink to cool my tongue. The one drink did last me the whole meal.The appetizer course arrives on a sectioned, metal tray, with a pretty cheap spoon (no other utensils needed). The whole thing looks like lunch service in the military. Anyway, the plate includes:The food comes out super fast. And if you ask for more of something, they bring that out super fast. And what's evident, is that EVERYTHING is pre-made. It's nice, because food comes quickly. The downside is that the fried items are not as crisp as they should be. The mini-samosas were pretty crisp, and not very oily. They were the only good fried item. My guess is that the outside was so thin, it turned into something like a cracker. They were tasty.The fried hot pepper, was spicy, but had a mushy dough exterior that tasted bland. The Ragda Patis seemed the most interesting, but failed. It should have been crisp, but instead was a bit mushy. The best thing was the Khaman, it was tasty and very distinctive. We all loved it.The table had various condiments ranging from super sweet to fairly spicy. Some were pretty distinctive, like the garlic, peppers and peanuts.The entree course included:Before I talk about what was good or not, let's make this clear- what you see in these pictures is the portion for one person! Each of us got this amount of food. It's crazy.The entrees were accompanied by (not pictured):The Papadam and Pulao were standard, but otherwise the entree items were delicious! Especially the Chole, even though I was stuffed, I ordered a second dish to eat with the Khichdi. Steve pointed out that the Khichdi was authentic, exactly like what he had while recently traveling around Southern India.Unlike the pre-cooked fried items in the appetizer course, the Puri were steaming hot and fresh. It was a pleasure to eat with them.One interesting dish was the Batakanu Sak. While it wasn't particularly good, it was interesting because it tasted like Hungarian food my mom makes!The dessert course included a delicious, homemade Mango Ice Cream and a decent Chai Masala (Indian tea with cardamom, ginger, and milk). Steve and Justin both had seconds on the tea. While I considered seconds on the ice cream, I passed; my stomach was full enough.In traditional Indian style, they delivered a big dish of Mukhwas for us to munch at the end of the meal. It's a dish made of fennel seeds, anise seeds, coconut, and sesame seed. It's a digestive aid, and Steve enjoyed a bit of it. But I can't stand this post-meal snack. Frankly the smell even bothers me.This huge feast costs $31 plus a required 18% service fee. It was well worth it. I won't be back soon, but I will go back!

I'm glad you finally made it there. I also like that you can request your dishes more or less spicy.  But, unless they've changed the outside it's not unassuming there's a huge, sparkly elephant above the restaurant.  http://www.veggiechic.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/05/vatan.jpg

The presentation is pretty authentic. When I was in Kerala, every restaurant (and in individual homes as well) had the metal or sometimes wooden bowls that housed chutneys and raitas, while the main dishes (usually 4-5 each meal) were served from a communal sectioned plate. The only difference is that naan was our spoonI think I'd go there just for Ganesha!

I saw all the pictures and can vouch that it eeach dish looks very authentic. The dishes were a mix of gujarati and South Indian dishes I think.Vegetarian food is not my scene though and like you Lon, I would come back, but not soon. The way you spelt the dishes in the post were quite accurate.I was quite impressed by what you said about the service. It is important that you have someone who can help one navigate the menu, especially in 'exotic'/ regional restaurants. I feel that this is sorely missing in Mumbai

Aurora
CONTENT
Sara found a special deal going on at Aurora Aurora, Monday Regional Night, a 3 courses with wine pairings, for just $40. Each month they will focus on food and wine from a different region of Italy (this month is Puglia). I had to be skeptical, but as the night went on, they won me over.I arrived a bit early and sat by the bar, where a few complimentary appetizers are offered for those drinking. I appreciated the glass of water, friendly conversation, and no pressure to order a drink as I waited for my friends.We were seated in a cozy little dining room, and a bread bucket was dropped. We couldn't get enough of the focaccia, all of us focusing on the soft onion-y little cubes, neglecting the other bread. A little amuse arrived, yellow beets, ricotta, and a drop of balsamic, which really surprised me as I thought the offer was already generous.The first course, Porcini, Chickpea, and Baccala Soup, was hearty but not heavy, chunky and full of herbs. Unfortunately, it wasn't heated evenly so the cold spots were annoying. The Negroamaro Rosato Del Solento paired well with the it, but I really enjoyed smelling it more than drinking it.For the second course, two of us got the Orechiette with Broccoli Rabe, Hot Peppers, and Alici (anchovies). I didn't taste the alici but it was an interesting way to have broccoli rabe, chopped up for a sauce.The other option was Ricotta and Eggplant Ravioli that looked like dumplings. The tomatoes and pecorino were great but something about the filling was fibrous, possibly the eggplant skins. The pasta dough had a couple of hard spots too. The paired wine, Salice Salentino, was too dry for me, literally drying out the inside of my mouth, but having it with the food helped.For the last course, two of us got the Red Snapper baked in parchment, opened table-side, which was simple, nothing wrong with it but nothing great about it either. The Primitivo del Salento by Punta Aquila, our last wine pairing, was my favorite, very fruity and easy to drink, resulting in me actually finishing the generous glass.Two of us got the Il Duo Di Pollo. The chicken and prosciutto roll was a little hard but the chicken sausage was tender and moist, flavored well with fennel seeds. The eggplant parmigiana made it a complete and satisfying plate. The celery root puree was good but it didn't work with the rest of the dish for me.We ordered a Tiramisu for dessert (not part of the 3 course deal) and they stuck a candle in it for us, so we could celebrate Angela's birthday. It's a good size to share when often you're too full for a full dessert after a three course meal.

Are burritos sandwiches?  What a fun debate!
CONTENT
Jeff at Unbreaded wrote a great post with his opinion about what a burrito is. He believes that regardless of the definition or the legal case surrounding burritos (finding them not to be a sandwich), burrito are sandwiches.Another of his commentors actively disagreed, but also claimed other items, like falafel in pita, are not sandwiches. I felt the need to weigh in (I love giving my two cents). My response (extended a bit and linked-up for FoodMayhem readers):--@BJN & @Jeff - Here's the thing, food is subjective, frankly it's art. And terminology varies by region. That said, we can look to history for some suggestions about all this. First of all, I have to say that while all the carts and shops near me in NYC sell falafel in pita as a sandwich, it is only to help as a reference. You see, pita, in one form of another has been baked and eaten with falafel since at least 1000 A.D. (documented). And the term 'sandwich' has only existed since 1762.Clearly it's possible to re-categorize food items. Perhaps the falafel in a pita combo was usurped by the sandwich grouping.But what about our original issue? Burritos? Well, they're a 20th century phenomena. Which means they could easily be within the category. However, if you digg deeper, there are sitings of meat wrapping in tortillas back to 1840. And non-Mexican groups were cooking and eating food with tortilla and tortilla variants all the way back to 16th century.So the family of tortillas, let's think about it as well. Tortilla means cake, and includes cake-like omelettes, with or without potatoes depending on where you go. It also includes arepas (corn cakes or cassava cakes).Arepas are eaten alone, topped with various items, or sliced open and eaten as a sandwich. Uh oh... I'm seeing overlap!So is an arepa a sandwich (open-face, or otherwise)? Sure.Let's dial back and look at the definition of a sandwich:(A) Two or more slices of bread or a split roll having a filling in between; (B) One slice of bread covered with food.Cripes.. \"bread\" dang! Corn cakes are not bread. Because the definition of bread:A usually baked and leavened food made of a mixture whose basic constituent is flour or meal.Hmm. corn meal, maybe arepas are bread? Although they're not 'usually' leavened. So they're usually not bread? This is up for interpretation.What about tortillas? Usually not bread too? Since we make them, we can tell you're they're bread-like, but not bread.Ready to have your mind blown? What about pizza? Oh no! Leavened bread with toppings. Yes, pizza is technically an open-faced sandwich. In fact, Jessica was taught in culinary school exactly that: pizza is an open-faced sandwich. By the way, we love making pizza too: NY-style and Chicago-style. Another open-faced sandwich: gyro! Pita is leavened. And guess what, that makes falafel a sandwich too. (See I'm not just wandering here, we're getting somewhere)Hot dogs? Yep, sandwiches! Read the definition again. A sliced roll with filling. Joinkies.Burritos, well no leavened dough... there's only one slice of the \"bread\"-like part... and it's not sliced open and stuffed. I'm siding with the court. It does not meet (meat?) the definition.This was a fun trot through food history and definitions.

Jeff Vogel

@Lon Thanks for getting involved with our little debate.  Some really good FACTS there, really compliments our BS.Basically, in English, I believe the word "sandwich" can refer to the specific object: two slices of bread with fillings; and can also speak to a broader category of things that are served in a portable, handheld style in contrast to a platter with utensils.  I am willing to admit that a burrito is always referred to as a burrito, and not as a sandwich.But to get a little too deep in my own minutiae, a sandwich can be a utilitarian word, a broad based category of things that have more common with each other than another group of things, platters.Sandwiches served on any bread share certain characteristics and personality traits: mobility, a certain hold-and-eat style and a focus on the bread as much as the fillings.For argument's sake, suppose I wanted a Mediterranean sandwich.  It is traditionally served on a lavash or pita.  Would I have to put the same fillings on a Kaiser roll for it to be considered a sandwich?  No.  The bread must be judged as symbiotic with the fillings.  The sandwich only works if the bread and the filling are truly meant to be together.So I say a burrito, which no doubt was first invented when some guy  wanted to take his beans and rice platter to go, is a sandwich, in that it was designed to be held together in a package and eaten.I would never ever ever order a burrito and expect to get a sandwich.  That's ridiculous.  But if you ask the question, is a burrito a type of sandwich?  Is an elephant a type of mammal?  Is a geranium a plant?  The answer is yes.

Pearl - No no no... They're so delicious, but don't meet the criteria.  They're a pastry.However, Ni Zhe Ho Tway (the honey ham, eaten with lotus seed inside a baked, fold of dough) would be a sandwich.  Btw, while that thing is insanely sweet, it is quite tasty.

Mercadito Grove
CONTENT
Last night, St. Patrick's Day, seemed like any other weekday night out during this recession. I didn't see or hear any crazy party people. I thought I would have to battle crowds last night and only agreed to go out because Tracy (a friend that recently moved to DC) is in town for work. We met up at Mercadito Grove Mercadito Grove, a dark little place, with tightly packed tables, and not much decor. The paper printed menus were held together by a single binder ring so I was surprised to see that the food was a little more refined than most Mexican, which means it was less oily and plated nicely, but also more expensive.We started with the Guacamole Tasting, and while I'm not normally a fan of guacamole, I have to admit that I really liked the mango guacamole. The smoky chipotle flavor really won me over and it didn't really taste like avocados. The Guacamole de Naranja (roasted garlic, orange, chile de arbol) was also good, quite unique and fruity, but I could taste the avocados more here and of course, the regular tasted like avocados. The chips were really crispy and fresh, and totally addictive.The Mole Tacos taste like they look, chicken with a sweet Mole Sauce, fresh and simple.The Pescado Tacos were a little more unique than the average fish taco, with the pungent kick of huitlacoche and the texture of grilled corn. It was a little hard for me to pay $14 per plate of 4 tacos, after the 50 cent tacos in Mexico, but these were packed with filling so I think it's reasonable for NY.

Fast Chicken & Rice
CONTENT
I was feeling a bit lazy about dinner tonight, fortunately Jessica had defrosted some chicken thighs. I turned on the grill and grabbed some rice, this was going to happen fast!Basically, I scooped some rice into a non-stick sauce pot, sprinkled Adobo generously over-top, added about a teaspoon of vegetable oil and filled it with water. After simmering it, covered, for ten minutes, I turned off the heat and fluffed the rice. It sat covered while I grilled the chicken.To make the chicken, I stirred together tomato paste, chili oil, star anise, mustard powder, cayenne powder, ancho chili powder, garlic powder, kosher salt, and pomegranate molasses.I coated the thinned chicken thighs, coated them with the spread, and grilled them for about four minutes per side.Yum! Quick and easy dinner.

Le Pain Quotidien
CONTENT
I popped in to Le Pain Quotidien (multi-locational) this morning for a cup of coffee. Their coffee is pretty flavorful, only slightly bitter, a good stand-by but nothing to rave about. I like that they have agave syrup as a sweetener option beyond the standard sugars.As I waited for my coffee, I tried to snap a few pictures (no flash) of the baked goods and a women came over waving and saying something like, no pictures of the pastries. (I bring this up because Pearl recently asked about reactions to our camera.)This happens very infrequently but once in a while it does. I haven't been able to figure out the logic behind this policy yet because if I wanted a picture of any piece, I could just buy it and bring it home, take as many pictures as I'd like.So until someone explains a good reason for it, this kind of policy turns me off, and with the many choices I have in this city, I'd rather not patronize these establishments.

When people are polite about it and explain the reasoning, I feel fine about respecting their wishes.I believe for places like this (bakeries, Whole Foods, Pinkberry - the latter two, well, in WF I was asked to stop taking pictures, and PB has a posted no-photography policy) they don't want people stealing their layout or business... format?  I'm not saying it's that smart because I can easily go 3-4 times or more just to observe and then copy their stuff anyway, but I feel like that can be the only reason they won't let me take photos.  Whole Foods?  I mean seriously?It's silly also because let's say a food item, a cookie, I can go home and eat it and try to deconstruct it anyway.  Maybe I won't get all of the ingredients but I can get close (or someone with a very refined tongue will).  It really bothers me that places seem so... careless with this policy.

CONTENT
This is one of those clean-out-your-fridge recipes. It's a Chinese-style soup I've been making for ages, starting in college, before I really knew how to cook, so no skills necessary.Start with chicken broth or stock in a pot. Add some sliced onions and some Sa Cha sauce. I had some tofu so I cubed it and threw that in too. Let those cook for about 10 minutes.

Elephant & Castle
CONTENT
Our friends Rachel and Brandon suggested Elephant & Castle Elephant & Castle (not related to the chain called Elephant & Castle) for brunch. We met there surprised to see it packed wall to wall, with a wait even when we left (around 3pm). The menu is simple American with a few foreign touches here and there. Nothing too exciting, but not so ordinary that you'd think it boring.The Eggs 'N Apples Benedict on French Toast sounded most interesting, a way to get a bit of both, savory and sweet. It solves the most common brunch dilemma, a salty protein rich meal or a carb-heavy dessert disguised as breakfast. I requested the maple syrup on the side, so mine was not so sweet, just lightly sweetened by the apples which was enough for me. The thick French Toast was fluffy and buttery, topped with the most perfect of poached eggs. The Hollandaise adds another layer of richness making it decadent, but not sickeningly so.Lon had the Elephant Burger, with bacon and cheddar, curried sour cream with scallions on the side (at his request). It was pretty average and cooked to medium when he ordered medium-rare.

2009-03-15 21:59:00
Pearl, most of the time, it goes unnoticed. Occasionally people get nervous about it. Occasionally, wait staff will ask what the pictures are for. A few times we have gotten special treatment but it's not often. I think there are a ton of people in NY who take pictures of their food so...

When I lived in Philly, they were pretty much always packed because of their happy hour drink specials. Plus, they have pub food, otherwise known as mecca for me.

Holy cow, I never saw the connection! This completely makes sense now-according to the website, the E & C you visited is sister to the Dublin restaurant. We ate there once, and when I moved back to the States, I thought the American E & C chains were really poor imitations of a better restaurant.Turns out, there's a reason for that...

Left-over Pockets
CONTENT
I have a shopping day planned with the girls (and cousin Phil) at Woodbury Commons and I wanted to pack a little treat for my friends. We have a long car ride ahead of us and then we'll need lots of energy to power shop! I thought something like an empanada would be nice. It had to be a no-utensils-required kinda thing.As I debated over what type of filling to make, I remembered the delicious Wine-Braised Beef Shanks Lon made the other night. The meal had conveniently left us some very tasty veggies, actually the most delicious mixture! Think about it, leeks, carrots, parsnips, and butternut squash, braised with wine and beefy goodness. Because Winnie loves potatoes, I decided to hop on over to the farmer's market and grab German Butterball potatoes to throw in.Left-over Pockets~makes 12 piecesIngredientsInstructions1. Make empanada dough and allow to chill. (It's better if you can allow it to chill more than 1 hour.)2. In a large pan, heat left-overs and potatoes on medium low heat. Simmer for 15 minutes, adding water as needed. You don't want the mixture to burn but you don't want it to be too wet. Check to see if potatoes are tender. If not, continue cooking for another 5 minutes. Season to taste and remove from heat, allow to cool.3. Divide dough into 12 pieces. Keep unused pieces covered while working on each piece. Roll out to 5″ rounds (about 1/8″ thick). Fill with 2 tablespoons of filling. Seal edges however you like. Make all 12 the same way.4. Place on a cookie sheet with wax or parchment paper. Refrigerate for 30 minutes. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F while pockets are chilling. When they're ready, brush with egg wash. Bake for about 25 minutes or until golden.I've never liked left-overs this much before!

Wonders - that is hilarious (re: the the word verification)!  I wouldn't recommend leaving out the vinegar.  Do you have apple cider vinegar or lemon juice?  Either could substitute.  As a fallback you could use a vinegar-based hot sauce, although (obviously) that will make it spicy.

It's cheap and I'm pretty sure you'll use it again.Sara (#2)- NP! Glad you guys enjoyed them.EMC, I think that would be delicious! Throw in some shredded cheese!

Lamb Chops with Butternut Squash
CONTENT
The other day Jessica picked up some beautiful lamb chops during her 9th Avenue Shopping trip. They were a great price at under $9 per pound. Jessica's mom really wanted lamb and Jessica knew just how to make these gorgeous chops.First, she cubed the remaining, uncooked Butternut Squash (unused from the Wine-Braised Beef Shank recipe) and roasted it with just a bit of butter. When it came out, lightly colored, we seasoned with some kosher salt and white pepper.The star of the dish was the lamb! Jessica followed her very successful Porcini-Rosemary Beef Short Ribs recipe. We then simply grilled the chops for 90 seconds per side and plated them over the squash. Oh, it was so good.We tried to over-cook two of the chops for Jessica's dad. But, he doesn't care much for lamb, especially if it's not burnt. So he stuck mostly to the Spicy Tequila Shrimp. Next time we'll make a special treat for him.

Serving appetizers on endive leaves is great. It's nature's edible serving spoon. Less clean up and you get more veggies in. With the exception of my father, who picks all vegetables out of everything, everyone else loved this appetizer. Well, even he loved it as soon as we gave him permission to eat it without the endive.Spicy Tequila Shrimp~5-6 appetizer servingsInstructions -1. Arrange endive on a serving platter.2. In a medium saute pan heat sausage and onion on medium high heat. Stir around until sausage releases fat. Add crushed red pepper and toss around until sausage has softened.3. Add shrimp and cook until almost pink. Flambe using tequila. Toss and spoon onto endive leaves. Serve immediately.

Using endive leaves to fill for an appetizer is such a perfect idea. I did mine with grapefruit, avocado and mint leaves with a vinaigrette, or a pear, walnut blue cheese. I love the idea of the shrimp. I am going to try this version.

Economy Shopping on Ninth Avenue
CONTENT
After lunch at Bali Nusa Indah, Carol gave me a tour of her favorite shopping area. I had no idea these places existed and with the current economy, you'll consider these places a blessing.We started at Big Apple Meat Market Big Apple Meat Market, which looks like a ghetto supermarket when you enter. Don't be afraid. Just keep walking towards the back and hang a left into the meat room (a cold room). They sell very reasonably priced meats, like these lamb chops I got for $8.98 per pound. They're more than double at Fresh Direct.Just a block away, we entered Stile's Farmer's Market Stile's Farmer's Market, a tented no frills place to buy produce. I bought gorgeous red bell peppers for $1.99 per pound, lemons 5 for $1, cheap leeks, butternut squash, parsnips, and pita. It was great!Our last stop was International Grocer International Grocer, which sells dried herbs, spices, grains, beans, and more by weight. I got organic wheat berries, kasha, and mustard powder. They have some ethnic specialties leaning towards more Greek goodies, but also basics like baking chocolate. Carol suggested I pick up the pomegranate molasses (of course I did) but the whole store is a chefs dream.Next door to International Grocer, I peaked in at the fish store and it has very good prices as well. All these great stores in one clump (Ninth Avenue between 42nd street and 40th Street) makes it totally worth traveling over there.

Wine-Braised Beef Shanks
CONTENT
Jessica bought some beautiful, large beef shanks and we needed to sneak in at least one more hearty meal before the weather gets warm. So I found an interesting sounding recipe for Wine-Braised Beef shanks, which was taken from the Sept 19, 1995 issue of Family Circle. Sadly, the recipe was written poorly and didn't make a lot of sense. My instinct is that it was the web-translation from the paper magazine that caused the problem.So I adapted the recipe, cleaned up the parts that made no sense, and swapped a few ingredients, like some parsnip for half the carrot and butternut squash for rutabaga. The result was a far better (we think) balanced dish with wonderful, rich flavor.I prefer this type of dish served over twisted egg noodles, but since we didn't have any I used elbows. I plated each person separately.Wine-Braised Beef Shanks~makes 4 entreesIngredients2 tbsp. Vegetable Oil2 tbsp. All Purpose FlourGremolata IngredientsInstructions1. Preheat oven to 300 degrees F.2. Heat 1 tbsp. vegetable oil in ovenproof Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add beef; cook until browned, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove meat, reserve.3. Reduce heat to low, cook leeks, squash, carrot, and parsnip in another 1 tbsp. vegetable oil in Dutch oven 8-10 minutes, until soft. Add tomato paste and heat through. Stir in 1 cup water, wine, basil, marjoram, garlic, and salt. Add reserved meat, cover with veggies.4. Bring to simmer. Cover. Bake in preheated oven for 3.5-4 hours or until beef is very tender. About half way through the process, turn everything.5. Place beef and vegetables in serving dish. Pour cooking liquid into small sauce pan. Skim off fat. Whisk together flour, black pepper, and 2 tbsp. water in small bowl until smooth. Whisk in a little of the cooking liquid. Whisk flour mixture into saucepan. Cook over medium heat, stirring, until mixture bubbles and thickens, about one minute. Spoon sauce over meat and vegetables.6. Prepare Gremolata: Finely chop together zest, garlic and parsley (this can also be done up to two hours ahead of time). Sprinkle over serving dish or individual servings.

Interview with Cat Cora
CONTENT
A few weeks ago, we got to meet Cat Cora, the only female Iron Chef, in person! She is just adorable, as you can see from this great pic Lon took of her. Despite being a celebrity chef, she has an incredibly warm vibe and seems really down to earth.FoodMayhem (FM): Chef Cat Cora, thank you for speaking with FoodMayhem.com. You're a restaurateur, celebrity, author, editor, mom, spokesperson, and non-profit founder–in other words, you're busy! How do you balance everything in your work life and your personal life?Chef Cat Cora (CC): When I am at home with my family, I try to be in the moment as much as I can. When I'm on the road we try to arrange for my family to come with me, if possible. That way, I get the best of both worlds.FM: Thank you for creating Chefs for Humanity; we think it's awesome! How can FoodMayhem readers get involved for 2009?CC: Readers can find more information on the organization’s website www.chefsforhumanity.org. There they can learn more about Chefs for Humanity and any upcoming projects we have. We highly encourage people to get involved and help to make a difference.FM: We love watching you on Iron Chef and you always seem super.. But, would you reveal your kryptonite? In other words, what ingredient would give you the most trouble, if it showed up as a secret ingredient?CC: Any ingredient that is very secondary, such as dairy or flour, are tricky. Things that aren’t normally the main component/flavor of a dish are difficult to make stand out and be flavorful at the same time.FM: For us, food is life… love… religion even. Where is your food Mecca ? Where do you travel to for food?CC: I have found great dishes most everywhere I’ve traveled to. Every place has it’s own amazing foods and fresh ingredients. Great tropical locations, such as Costa Rica or Singapore, usually have amazingly fresh and flavorful produce. I also love visiting locally owned, smaller mom and pop places or places that locals recommend. They are my favorite places to try out.FM: Even food lovers dislike some foods. Are there ingredients you don't like?CC: I don't typically eat a lot of sausage but it has its moments and place every once in a while.FM: You grew up in Jackson, Mississippi, but now you live in Santa Barbara, California. Tell us about your local food scene: where do you shop for food (e.g. restaurants, retail stores, web sites, etc.)?CC: My family and I frequent local farmers markets and smaller organic stores, which are mainstays in SoCa. They are absolutely the best places to find fresh, seasonal foods and it is important to us to support the local farmers. Farm-to-table freshness is very important to my family and I.FM: Speaking of the home scene, can you lend advice to our readers at home? FoodMayhem readers tend to be better-than-average cooks; they strive to be the best they can. What steps can home cooks take to become better, more professional cooks?CC: Keep cooking! Keep experimenting and tweaking recipes to fit your taste. Branch out and learn about other culture. Vacations are a great way to do this hands on, but if you can’t get away, just explore your hometown area! Every city offers so much diversity so if you can't vacation - explore what is around you.FM: Speaking of being best, you know something about being the best in cooking shows. Other than Iron Chef America, what are the best cooking shows?CC: I think almost all the shows on Food Network are entertaining and educational for the home viewer. It’s great in that there are a vast variety of talent being showcased so there is something for everyone’s tastes.FM: What qualities attract you to these shows?CC: The variety of shows and chefs that are featured, each providing a special flare or twist to fulfill any type of viewersFM: You cook in many scenarios, the shapes and sizes of kitchens change, but you don't. Has being a petite, female chef ever posed any difficulties?CC: I think people may underestimate my potential as a petite female chef, but I have always proven them wrong. My motto is “Small, but mighty!”FM: We've talked about many things you've done and are doing, what's next for Chef Cat Cora?CC: We’re working on several additional show ideas, my own line of cookware, and several restaurants nationwide - we’ve got a lot of pots on the stove right now, so to speak! I also recently opened my first restaurant concept, CCQ (Cat Cora’s Barbeque) at Macy’s in Costa Mesa, CA. I’m very excited to expand this to other Macy’s in the months and years to come!Visit my website often to stay in the loop of it all – www.catcoracooks.comMy friend Sara just alerted me to more breaking news on Cat Cora, she and her partner, Jennifer, are both pregnant!

Bali Nusa Indah
CONTENT
I met up with Carol for lunch at Bali Nusa Indah Bali Nusa Indah, where we got the window seat, looking onto the not so sexy Ninth Avenue. We were both excited, since Indonesian food is still a rarity. I have very little experience with the cuisine, but Carol took a course on Indonesian cooking, so she guided me through. Finally narrowing it down to three lunch specials for the two of us, we were ready with forks.We started with a wonderful chicken soup (part of lunch special), a nice traditional broth with bean sprouts, and the aromatic fried shallots. The cellophane noodles were perfect, added to serve, instead of sitting there getting mushy.You can see that the Gado Gado Salad (also part of lunch special) was severely over-dressed, but it was very flavorful, rich with coconut, peanuts, and lemon grass.The Nasi Goreng with Beef was a tad more interesting, or different. The dry-ish but flavorful shreds of beef reminded me of pork floss.

coincidentally we had a (fairly expensive) Indonesian lunch at Bombay on Friday. lovely prawn sambal though i rember the one at Singapore being redder and spicier. We had a chicken nasi Goreng which was nice and spicy and garnished with sago. Also tried a vegetarian Balinese pot rice. the curry was similar to thai red curry

Irish Soda Bread
CONTENT
I got home last night and decided I had to make Irish Soda Bread. It's been on my mind ever since I made the Green Tea Pecan Crumbles. St. Patty's Day has just been buzzing around in my head. Luckily, you'll see that the web offers up tons of recipes on Irish Soda Bread and the vast majority of them are \"easy as pie\". Why do people say that? Pie is not that easy. This is way easier than pie!The one problem is that I didn't have buttermilk on hand so decided to try making faux buttermilk, for the first time. My verdict is that it works when you're in a bind. The texture came out amazing, moist and spongey, and the soda bread tastes good. I'm enjoying a slice with my coffee right now. But, I think the flavor of real cultured buttermilk would be even more amazing. (Without a side-by-side comparison, I can't be sure, but that's my guess.) One more note: I only had 1/2 cup of raisins left so that's what I put in this recipe but use 1 cup if you have.Irish Soda Bread~adapted from Irresistible Irish Soda Bread1. In a large bowl, stir together flour, raisins, sugar, baking powder, salt, and baking soda.2. In a medium sized bowl, combine egg and buttermilk. Mix wet mixture into dry mixture, just until combined. Stir in butter trying not to over-mix.3. Pour into a 9×5 loaf pan prepared with non-stick spray. Let it rest on the counter for 30 minutes. Preheat your oven to 325 degrees F at this time.4. Bake for 60-70 minutes, or until toothpick comes out clean. Allow to cool in the pan for 15 minutes. Remove from pan and cool completely. Store wrapped in aluminum foil.

Chicken and Pork Comfort Over Rice
CONTENT
Sometimes you get home tired and you just want to eat. Nothing fancy, just something easy, filling, and made in one pot. The ingredients in this dish are based on what we had in the fridge and the flavor profile is Chinese because I wanted to use left-over rice. I didn't expect much from this last minute, thrown-together dish. I didn't think this would be a recipe to post, but it is. If you're familiar with Chinese food, it's a cross between Soy Sauce Chicken and a Taiwanese dish of Minced Pork with Sauce Drizzled on Rice. Two comfort foods combined in one really hit the spot for me so I had to share.Chicken and Pork Comfort Over Rice~makes 3-4 entreesIngredientsInstructions1. In a small bowl, stir together pork, soy sauce, 2 teaspoons cornstarch, and sugar.2. Heat oil in a 4 quart pot on medium heat. Add pork mixture and stir around until browned evenly.3. Add chicken in a single layer. Add 1 cup water, ginger, and garlic. Bring to a boil. Reduce to simmer and cook uncovered for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally. Turn the chicken half way through.4. Spread rice on serving platter. Place chicken pieces on the rice. Discard ginger pieces.5. In a small bowl , stir together remaining 2 teaspoons cornstarch with 4 teaspoons water. Stir into pork sauce in a slow stream. Use only as much as you need to thicken into a sauce. Pour over chicken and rice.

Green Tea Pecan Crumbles
CONTENT
These look kinda like mochi huh? They're not. They are a play on snowballs or Mexican Wedding Cookies. I added matcha green tea powder for a subtle but interesting flavor change, and to make them green. After all, St. Patrick's Day is just around the corner.Green Tea Pecan Crumbles~makes 30 cookies~adapted from the Snowballs recipe in Great Cookies by Carole WalterInstructions-1. Put the pecans and 1/4 cup flour in food processor with steel blade. Pulse 5 or 6 times, then process 8 to 10 seconds, until pecans are chopped medium fine. Add the remaining flour and salt. Pulse 2 or 3 times to combine.2. In a stand mixer, with a paddle attachment, mix butter on medium-low speed until light and creamy. Reduce to low speed and add 2 tablespoons confectioner's sugar, cold water, and vanilla. Mix until combined, scraping down when needed.3. Add the flour/nut mixture in three additions, mixing only until combined. Do not overmix. Remove the bowl from stand mixer, cover with plastic wrap, and refridgerate for at least 30 minutes.4. Place oven shelves in upper and lower thirds of the oven. Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Line two jelly roll pans with parchment paper.5. When dough is chilled, roll into 1 1/4″ balls and place 2″ apart on parchment paper.Bake for 20-22 minutes, or until just lightly browned on the bottom. Remove from oven and cool for 10 minutes.6. While they are cooling, sift together 1 cup confectioner's sugar and green tea matcha powder, into a wide and shallow bowl. (I used a pie plate.)7. Roll the cookies in sugar/green tea mix, coating heavily, but very carefully. They are fragile.8. Roll again for a second coat, and then place them on a wire rack to cool for several hours.9. Store in an airtight container between sheets of wax paper for up to 3 weeks.

Homemade Italian Chicken Sausage
CONTENT
Since we had some pork fat left over from trimming pork loin recently, I wanted to make sausage. Jessica defrosted a chicken and it seemed like a fun protein to work with. Having never made chicken sausage, I approached it the same way I would with most any other protein. I did go light on the herbs and spices because chicken is such a light flavor that you don't want to over-power it.Sadly, our sausage grinder attachment for the Kitchen Aid is in storage right now, so I used our old school hand-driven grinder. It's far more annoying to work with, but it got the job done and these turned out yummy on some freshly baked ciabatta rolls.Italian Chicken Sausage~makes five linksIngredientsInstructions1. In a mortar, mash all ingredients except chicken and fat until a fine paste. In a plastic container, combine paste with chicken and fat. Cover and place in freezer for about 20 minutes, until meat is firm, but not frozen.2. Coarsely grind firm mixture.3. If you have sausage casing available, fill them with the ground mixture. Otherwise shape into sausage links, it may help to re-chill the mixture before doing this.4. Grill with onions, serve on your favorite roll. I dressed the roll with some Roasted Red Pepper and Sriracha mayo.

Mexican Snacks
CONTENT
We love to pick up snacks while traveling (or from when others travel). During our recent trip to Playa del Carmen, Mexico we picked up several.One of the snacks was selected explicitly for Stephen. Gusanito's Luminosos are gummy worms that come with a special tweezer that is electrical! I'm not sure exactly what it does, but I assume it lights up the worms. This seems so kitschy and fun, a perfect toy for Stephen. We didn't taste these and Stephen is saving them for when he and Kasi return from Vegas.The second treat is a pack of Submarinos - Fresa. These are basically strawberry-flavored Twinkies. Stephen and Kasi tasted them and tell us that they taste like any plain ole Twinkie. So sad, we were hoping for more!The third treat, a big bag of corn-based rods, we did get to taste. The bag of Churricos had about four ingredients: corn, oil, peppers (habanero or guajillo), and salt. It is a very simple flavor that's easy to enjoy. Some of the rods had the habanero flavor, these were a smoother texture, darker orange, and had nice heat. The other rods were slightly ridged (looking like they were pushed out of an extrusion die) and a lighter orange color. They had nicer flavor and less heat. Eating them together was nice. The flavor was light yet addicting. \"The Chippie\" wrote about them and has a nice pic of the bag on the beach.Overall we weren't too excited about snack options in Playa, hence the creation of our own snack.

Beet Carpaccio
CONTENT
I've seen this presentation at restaurants before (can't remember where though) and it's such a simple way to make an elegant looking beet salad. Here, I used golden beets but any color will work. You can cook the beets any way you prefer as long as it remains whole. Peel them and allow them to cool. Slice them very thinly with a mandolin. Arrange in any pattern you like.For golden beets, I quartered some cherry tomatoes, but if you use purple beets, try some little cubes of apple or pear. Try to sprinkle with the best salt and the best pepper you can find. Drizzle with a syrupy balsamic vinegar and a strong olive oil. Simple and delicious.

Lon

Lesley- Tequila is delish!  Guajillos are the second most common pepper used in Mexican cooking.  So if you can't find them locally and you plan on experimenting in Mexican cuisine, these would be the peppers worth ordering online (try http://www.penzeys.com).If you don't want to order them, the best chili substitute would be either New Mexico chilis or Cascabels.But, honestly, if you can't find guajillos, I doubt you'll find those.You could try to get a similar flavor by sauteing together tomato paste, a touch of ground rosemary and oregano and ground red pepper flake.  I'm not sure how close that will be, but it's my best guess as how to build the flavor profile from scratch

We had a yellow tilefish for dinner the other night and I wanted to extend the seafood theme into a side dish. So I came up with a new seafood rice side dish. I wanted the flavor to be all American, but I didn't really want it to be southern. This was actually a hard target for me, since most rice recipes I know are foreign or southern. In the end, I think this worked out pretty well and was easy. Especially, since I used frozen seafood, that we had on hand.Fast Seafood RiceIngredientsInstructions

But German chocolate cake isn't German at all! It is derived from a recipe listed on the back of a product from the old "German Chocolate" company! It's from the Southern United Statescheck it out: http://www.kitchenproject.com/html/Is_German_Chocolate_Cake_Really_German.html

Ma Po Tofu
CONTENT
Ma Po Tofu is actually very easy to make. It's one of the first recipes I asked my mom to teach me. It's a little difficult to give you exact measurements for the recipe though. There are so many types of tofu, from silken to firm, all giving off different amounts of water when cooked. All of them taste good. It's just a matter of preference. The picture above is one made with medium firm tofu, which Lon prefers. The one below is a soft tofu, which I like equally as much as the firmer tofu. This recipe is also quite mild, suitable for most, but if you like things spicy, you can add more chili garlic sauce.Ma Po Tofu~2 servingsIngredientsInstructions

I love ma po tofu, but yours looks much better than what I've had in the past. I have never seen any liquid, just dryness, so this is a welcome recipe that I'll probably try next week given I have both pork and tofu on hand. I'm really looking forward to recreating this, and I think husband will like it too-tofu is hard to palate for him, but when it's paired with pork I doubt he'll protest!

Cafe Katja
CONTENT
Last night, in the blistering cold, I actually went outside. Freakin' nuts, yeah! The only thing that could get me outside in this weather is the promise of good food, and my friend Angie tends to have a special talent for picking out good places, so I was enticed to meet her and Winnie at Cafe Katja Cafe Katja. It's an inviting little place with the sweetest waitress. The menu is unique (well, there isn't much Austrian food in NY) but the plates come out prettier than you'd expect of sausage dishes. (I only brought my point-and-shoot camera though so I apologize for not-so-great photos.)We started with the Aufschnitt Teller, German for Charcuterie Plate. It's a great sharing plate that I highly recommend for groups. The Liptauer is a spread but has the flavor of Sour Cream and Onion Chips. The Liverwurst is good, and even better with the fresh horseradish. The range of blood sausage to pork belly goes well with pickled onions, carrots, mushrooms, and more, so have fun making lots of different combinations. With plenty of toast to transport, this was probably my favorite plate.We also shared an Emmentaler Sausage, served nice and hot, lightly crisped skin, with cheese inside (as the name suggests). I'm just not a fan of Eastern European dumplings because they're just soft blobs of dough, but Angie ad Winnie really enjoyed the cabbage. It goes nicely with the sausage but the caraway was a bit strong for me.

Lon had this idea for cutting skate into strips because it looks like nature intended for us to do so. See the lines already marked for you? (I cut them at every other line.)Salt & Pepper Skate~makes two entree portionsIngredientsInstructions1. In a medium sized bowl, mix together corn starch and cornmeal. Toss skate strips in and coat evenly.2. Heat frying oil in a wok. Prepare a bowl with paper towel on the side. Fry skate strips (you may need to do it in 2 batches) and put finished strips on paper towels. Sprinkle with a generous amount of salt and pepper.4. Plate fish and onion together. In Chinese restaurants Salt and Pepper dishes are often plated on a bed of shredded lettuce, but I didn't have any.

Truly fish can get as simple as this - but you will need the best knife around to do a good job of the slicing. Skates are difficult to get where I live and I usually rely on the seafood restaurants for such simple pleasures.
Jessica@Foodmayhem
2009-03-03 08:01:00
EMC, I think this preparation will taste good for any fish that is strong enough to not fall apart, but it will just taste different.Bill G, not all salt & pepper is prepared the same way. You can make squid like this but the shrimp is a little different. I usually use vegetable oil for frying which is what most Chinese do at home.Pearl, Skate is a bottom dwelling fish in the same family as stingrays.Jamie, yea, I sometimes feel like frying is cheating as a chef. =)Samantha, cleaning and filleting skate is a pain in the butt. However, if you can buy it already cleaned, it is super easy to cut into strips.

Rosemary Sumac Lamb Loin Chops
CONTENT
We got these little lamb loin chops that are so cute. They look like mini T-bone steaks, only a few forkfuls each, making them a perfect little appetizer course. I decided to do something very simple and this is a recipe any beginner can make.Rosemary Sumac Lamb Loin ChopsInstructions -1. Rub the lamb loin chops with sumac and rosemary on both sides. Season with salt and pepper.2. Heat a small non-stick pan (prepared with cooking spray) on medium high heat. Put chops on and don't touch for 4 minutes. Turn over and don't touch for another 4 minutes. Remove from heat and rest for 4 minutes. (This gave me medium-rare but a bit more rare near the bone. Adjust for your taste.)3. Plate with cherry tomatoes.

Artichokes with Creamy Caper Dip
CONTENT
When I'm sick, I start using the microwave to cook. It's just a lot less effort and quick. I can return to sitting on the couch in no time. Luckily, I had artichokes in the fridge. You just cut off the stem and about 1″ off the top. Place it in a microwave safe bowl with about 1/4″ of water, cover and microwave for about 3 minutes. Rest for 2 minutes, turn it over, cover, and microwave for another 2 minutes. This was for 1 medium sized artichoke. Add some time for larger artichokes or if you want to heat two or three at a time.While you are microwaving, you can make this easy dip.Creamy Caper Dip~enough for 3 to 4 artichokesJust stir all the ingredients together and it's ready!

Lon

Pearl - Crawfish look like tiny lobster and to some extent, taste like them.  The flavor is different, perhaps a touch more gamey.  But the main difference is the texture.  Crawfish are a much denser meat and have a really nice snap when you eat them.When I was a kid my parents would take me to a seafood place called "The Barge", which ironically, eventually sank (literally).  They had an amazing dish, served in a cauldron, that had crayfish in them.  Crayfish are (AFAIK) the same as crawfish, and are called differently just based on geography (like 'soda' vs.  'pop').  However, some folks also call them differently based on their size.  Larger critters are the crayfish and the smaller guys are crawfish.Anyway, the nice thing about when they get a little bigger is they've got these long claws that are fun to tear apart.Hope that helps.

Raspberries... Natural Aspirin
CONTENT
Coming back from Mexico, I'm feeling pretty ill. My doctor tells me I've got a really bad cold and my lungs sound terrible. That's always good news. He suggested loading up with acetaminophen and aspirin. The approach was interesting though. He said to take 500mg of Tylenol every six hours and to eat lots of raspberry preserves. Erg?!Who knew that raspberries are loaded with natural aspirin? Well, the Internet, of course. The 'net knows all... Well, actually, it turns out raspberries (and some other berries, like strawberries and blueberries) contain high levels of salicylic acid, which is chemically similar to acetylsalicylic acid (a.k.a. aspirin).So I toasted a roll and sauteed a bunch of shallots. I applied a light skim coat of mayo and honey mustard, then loaded the sandwich with raspberry preserves. It was delicious! In the end, I shouldn't be too surprised. Turkey tastes great with cranberry sauce, why not raspberry? Try it, you'll be surprised.

Ristorante Romagna Mia
CONTENT
We found out that Playa Del Carmen actually has a large Italian population, which meant we had to try some Italian food. We pretty much had our fill of Mexican at this point so it was perfect timing. With a little google searching, I found Ristorante Romagna Mia, with some strong reviews. It's on a road (we're not sure if it has a name) parallel and in between 1st avenue and the beach, just a little north of 28th street.We started with a Spinach and Apple Salad, relieved to see some vegetables at this point. The spinach in Playa has been a little different, a little rougher and thicker, which is fine with me, but Lon's not a fan. The flavors in this salad were interesting, the apples are coated in lightly caramelized sugar topped with a heavy hand of shredded romano cheese. It has the simple appeal that salty and sweet always does, but the sugar hardens quickly and starts to become a nuisance between your teeth. The crushed nuts are almost a powder and add very little to this salad.

It may very well be an awesome breakfast place, but it seems we may never know. It was an odd experience for us at the Monkey Cave. We loved the atmosphere, kind of San Francisco vibe meets the jungle. We had a friendly waiter and started with a wonderfully fresh Mango Lassi and a unique Mamey Shake.Honestly, I can't remember what the cactus one tasted like anymore.The Epazote and Panela was just boring and a little bitter, very skimpy on filling.

John Gray's Place
CONTENT
We read about John Gray's Place on Rick Bayless's website, as well as several others. It's known as one of the more upscale places in Playa with contemporary food, which was the perfect thing last night, now that we've had enough Mexican food.Through a window, you can see the kitchen, which is nice and clean. Most of the inside is dim, furnished with a dark wood, so we chose outdoor seating, where lights on trees and the nearby stores brightened our table just a bit. Some toasted bread with cilantro pesto is offered as you wait, outer pieces being crunchy and crouton-like, inside pieces a bit softer.*note: There's a John Gray's Kitchen in Puerto Morelos.

Tortas in Playa del Carmen
CONTENT
Remember the other day, when we hunted for tacos? Well, we also spotted several interesting shops to buy tortas (sandwiches). Unfortunately (or fortunately, depending on how you look at it), I couldn't eat as many different tortas as I did tacos, they're just too big. So I tried to pick the two most interesting ones I saw.I was the most excited about the first place I tried. It's called Mr. Kiwi's. It was the night after the horrible ferry ride and around 11pm, I had managed to rid myself of most of my nausea and Jessica was sleeping hers off. When I got to Kiwi's it was packed with locals. I LOVED the atmosphere. It was a blend of late night unhealthy eating (coughDRUNKcoughFOODcough) and healthy drinks (fresh fruit blends, etc.). My broken Spanish helped me order the Kiwi Especial. It took about 15 minutes to prepare, because it contained flank steak, chorizo, chicken, hot dogs, and some other stuff, but I don't remember what. The chef and the clerk had so much fun making it and showing it off to other patrons.They piled it on a huge hero bread, with mayo, bean spread, lettuce, and tomatoes. I carried it back to the hotel with a brisk walk, similar to the excitement a child has when going home with a new toy. When I unwrapped it, I started eating quickly, and just about as quickly I realized... that sandwich sucked. It had lots of meat, but not much flavor. It was just bleh. I didn't even finish it. So sad.Yesterday, for lunch, Jessica had some fresh fruit, and I stopped by Taco Chido, which you may recall was one of the winners from our Taco Hunt. I got a sandwich of flank steak (arrachero), chorizo, and onion. It was served on the more classic shaped Bolillo (like a Portugese roll in the US), but unlike many tortas, the bread wasn't pressed on the griddle. Like the Kiwi sandwich, it had mayo, bean spread, and lettuce. It also had one slice of cucumber on one side of the roll and one slice of tomato on the other -- a bit odd.This sandwich tasted much better than the Kiwi sandwich, but sadly, it was just average.I think I'm a bit spoiled. There is a place called Great Burrito, in Manhattan, that is exceptional. Their tortas are the absolute best. However, I should point out that my sandwiches here were $4 and $2 (USD) respectively, which beats the pants off the $6.50 I pay in NYC.

Seafood Buffet at Xcaret
CONTENT
Xcaret is an awesome eco theme park. We went snorkeling through some caves, and then again in a beautiful inlet, both times amongst beautiful and unique fish. As you walk through the park, you pass viewing points to see animals like wild boar, flamingos, spider monkeys, dolphins, and giant sea turtles. Iguanas roam freely and the plush plants line the walking paths. This place really impressed us, clean bathrooms everywhere, good signs and helpful staff, a world of activities and shows. The organization and careful planning ensures no waiting for anything (bathroom or activity) which makes it almost unreal for a theme park.We opted for the Plus Package which includes locker rental, snorkeling gear rental, towels, buffet lunch, and extra beverage tickets. We highly recommend the Plus Package because it's well worth the extra $30 (everything would cost a lot more purchased separately). We chose to have lunch at the seafood buffet (one of three choices) where we had the most amazing view.I didn't expect much from the food at a theme park, but it was actually pretty decent, with quite a variety. Beverages were included. (Don't you hate when buffets charge you extra for beverages?) We enjoyed most of the ceviches and salads, but weren't too fond of the hot seafood, mostly over-cooked getting drier and drier sitting on steam tables.Lon tried the cream shrimp soup (one of three choices) which was tasty but the air was too hot to be drinking soup. Lon added some dried guajillos and tortilla strips.The best part was their stir fry station where you chose whatever you wanted and they make it for you. They had chicken, beef, calamari, and fish, with tons of vegetables, including cactus, one of my favorite discoveries on this trip.The cakes were just ok, and rather sweet (sorry for the rapidly snapped, blurry pics).

Breakfast Tacos
CONTENT
Massages are pretty inexpensive here in Playa Del Carmen, about USD $59 for two people (1 hour each). But the even bigger benefit was chatting with the hostess, who spoke English pretty well. As we waited for our massages, we had a few minutes to find out where the locals eat. After some thought, she seemed hesitant to tell us. She kept saying, \"I don't know if you'll like it but... there are these shrimp tacos...\" Well we found those shrimp tacos on Calle Juarez just off of 5th Avenue. A line of taco carts line up and serve breakfast to (mostly) locals who are working in the area. At first, I thought it was odd that people ate tacos for breakfast but these were lighter than the kind we had eaten for dinner.There are several carts, but we found the one she recommended selling shrimp tacos, just as she described, with a little rice. We couldn't resist trying everything on the cart as well. They have a chili relleno (cheese stuffed pepper) taco with nicely pickled red onion. Another taco featured scrambled eggs with an interesting herb or vegetable. We weren't quite sure what it was, kind of seaweed like.It was better than the fruit at our hotel, but still not quite as good as I expected fruit here to be. For 15 pesos (just over USD $1) though, it's still a steal.

Eatingfoodboy - Practice makes perfectEat it - You know, papaya is definitely one of the oddest tasting fruits.  I know people make a "stink" over Durian, but I actually think papaya is equally offputting... at times.  Some papaya makes me queasy, while other times it can be amazing and luscious.

Bar in Cozumel
CONTENT
We wanted to watch Carnival in Cozumel, so we staked out a spot on a second floor bar. We can't remember the name now, but it's right across from the ferry. We knew it would be touristy so we didn't expect much. The choice was for the viewing point, not the food.We got there around 4PM and ordered some drinks. My pina colada was concentrated with fresh coconut but there was also some bitter aftertaste, while being extremely sweet. It tasted like Sweet 'n Low to me, but I don't see why they would put that in a drink. Lon ordered a non-alcoholic frozen mango, which was better, just juicy and sweet.The nachos were also pretty good, just simple, crisp chips with a bean sauce and melted cheese.

Cozumel Lunch at Asadero las Casuelas
CONTENT
On FoodMayhem we talk about every aspect of food. Usually those aspects involve looking at food, cooking food, thinking about food, and of course eating food. Sadly, and disgustingly, today I'm going to mention rarely discussed aspects of food, namely, post-processing. Ahem. The first part of my post is very journal like and kind of gross, so if you're only interested in the food, skip down to the \"Non-Gross Section\"If you've been following the blog, you shouldn't be too surprised, since we're in Mexico. It's not my first time in Mexico, but on this trip, together with Jessica, I've learned a few things about traveling here. First of all, vacationing here is also a war. A war between our stomachs and Mexico.Each day there is a battle between my ass and the toilet, or with less vulgarity, Mexican food and my stomach. In all fairness, I am lactose intolerant and there is dairy in every dish. Also, while I'm a chili head and love 'em all, my stomach doesn't. So almost needless to say, there have been several of these bathroom battles, and so far, I've lost most. Even Jessica, who has a rock solid stomach, has faced battles in there. Our hotel bathroom is lovely, but it's become one of the circles of hell.Moving on...Today, we saw another field of battle: the ferry to Cozumel. Our plan was to head over for a day of snorkeling in Chanka Naab, then to watch the sunset along the beach, and finally to have dinner at one of the highly recommended El Moro (Mexican) or Prima (Italian), depending on where we were. Well, it didn't work out AT ALL. Why? Well, we hopped on the 11am ferry, a solid 2.5-3 hours after we ate a normal breakfast (Jessica had eggs, I had pancakes). The ferry kicked our butts.It was 10 minutes in dock and 35 minutes on water of violent tossing and turning. Waves crashing in on us and the driver treating the ferry like his personal cigarette boat. Jessica hasn't experience motion sickness since she was a kid, and I've never had it. Well, there's a first time for everything. The two of us held each other tightly and concentrated all our might on not losing our stomachs. I had to yank a plastic bag out of my backpack, just in case. We managed to keep our cookies, but when we finally made landfall, we sat on the dock for about 10 minutes, before we felt ok to even walk. Then we sat on a random bench for half an hour, until we felt good enough to walk around.Non-Gross SectionCozumel kind of stinks, at least the main drag. It's the same touristy garbage as most of the places we saw during our honeymoon, because there are cruise ships landing. Everywhere you turn there are hock shops and people begging you to rent a vehicle from them or to go in their boat. We decided we didn't feel up to snorkeling, even though we walked to the edge of town, and walked back in to town.We felt up to eating lunch, and since 90 minutes had passed, we found our way (via my broken Spanglish) to Prima. Sadly, it doesn't open until dinner. But, guess what... we happened to be in Cozumel during Carnival!! Yay! No one told us, beforehand, and we were amazed. After asking 5 people and receiving three different answers, we discovered the parade started at 6pm and would be all along the main Avenue. We went into a main park, where kids were practicing their dance moves and discovered the only open tent, Asadero las Casuelas. I'm glad they were open, it was good!As we took our plastic seats, we watched some mis en place taking place. Three people were just about done shreading an enormous block of queso blanco, and moving on to hand grating a block of oaxacan. At another table an older woman was shaving cabbage, dicing onions, and chopping peppers. She was a machine.We each ordered dishes we had not only never eaten, but never heard of. Jessica got a plate of Gringas al Pastor and I got Guarache Bistec (more commonly known as Huarache).Gringas al Pastor are a variant on Tacos al Pastor, except they used a flour tortilla and added cheese. The cheese used at Asadero was the most flavorful we've had so far. And overall these were gobbled up in no time.The beef in the Guarache tasted exactly like the super tender veal served in Chinese restaurants. It was difficult to cut with the low quality tableware, but it melted in my mouth. It was served over a thick, corn tortilla (hence the name huarache, like a shoe) with lots of slaw, pickled onions, tomatoes, and freshly squeezed lime juice.Both of our dishes came with the standard pork and red bean soup, which was average, not as good as the one at El Fogon.I'm not sure if you'll find Asadero when you're in Cozumel, and if you do, I hope you didn't find it via ferry. But if you do find it, and you've got an apetite, I recommend it. It's a bit more expensive than some places, but the whole meal came to about US $9 and it was so worth it!

A friend of mine says that she and her husband come to India, eat their favourite street food, go down, eat again, go down - a sort of karmic circle. I guess living in India prepares our stomachs for most eventualities

Hunting for Tacos
CONTENT
We've passed by so many taquerias in the last few days that we decided the only thing to do is try as many as we can. We started with the one across the street from our hotel, El Hospital. They only serve one type of taco (10 pesos each), a pork taco, and some kind of soup. They were pretty bland and uninteresting, so we moved on.We also ordered a Chorizo Taco. The flavorful, crumbled chorizo was topped with some sweet roasted onions. This was one of my favorites of the night.They had a nice array of salsas that added to all this deliciousness. I was particularly crazy about their pico de gallo and all the sauces were self serve, including chips.We started with one Bistec and one Chorizo. Wow! These tasted of a freshness no others offered.The Cabeza d'Rez (cow head) was fatty and indulgent. It was perhaps the most succulent taco we'd eaten. Like the rib steak it came with fresh onions, cilantro, and lime.

We wanted to a change for breakfast today so we hopped around the corner to Hot Baking Company. Lon started with a Orange Strawberry Mango Smoothie with Yogurt, that tasted mostly of orange juice. I had a cappuccino that was really weak. So far, all of my coffees and cappuccinos here have been surprisingly weak.Lon chose an omelette with ground beef, red beans, and cheese. The eggs were nice and fluffy and the beef and beans were in a flavorful sauce. It came with refried black beans and the same good toast used on my sandwich.

El Fogon
CONTENT
After an afternoon of naps and margaritas by the pool, then another nap, we headed out to El Fogon for dinner. The friendly waiter (maybe owner), Miguel, is on high powered over drive, with a whacky sense of humor, that's hard to understand through his Spanglish. He zig zags back and forth like a bumble bee, dropping off a plate of Cactus Salad first, and waving at us, saying he'll be back soon. This is my first experience with cactus and I loved it, almost like marinated roasted peppers with just a bit more crunch. There is a teeny bit of sliminess on the surface but it didn't bother us.Our waiter came back around to explain the menu and we were confused so Lon told him to just bring us whatever he thought was good, and to throw a taco in there. Miguel was excited about the Taco Al Pastor, pointing to the spit.The plate included lots of stuff to mix and match together. The poblanos with cheese was wonderful, as were the charred spring onions. Lon said the guacamole was average and we didn't bother with the potato. We got a bunch of hot corn tortillas and hot flour tortillas to wrap stuff in.

La Bamba Jarocha
CONTENT
After checking out Mega and DAC Market, we headed over to La Bamba Jarocha, another Rick Bayless recommendation.The chips are served with a nice spicy sauce.There were a bunch of bottles on the table, all sauces probably house-made, living in former catsup and habanero bottles. We had no idea what was in each one and our communication skills were not getting us anywhere.We were able to choose off the menu (written in English): a simple array of ceviches, cocktails, soups, and a few others. Most dishes were offered in sizes, something like small, large, largest. We chose a small Octopus Cocktail and a small Mixed Ceviche. The cocktail is not the classic horseradish sauce you'd imagine. It's more like a sweet and sour sauce, tangy from tamarind, garnished with onion, cilantro, and avocados. The Octopus was so fresh and tender, one of the best I've had in a long time.

It could just be the image or my extreme specifications but how was the avocado? I have always judged the taste of ceviche not just on the seafood and sauce but the freshness and texture of the avocado.

EMC, the avocado didn't look particularly attractive, but it tasted good.  Nothing extraordinary, but we actually commented at lunch about how the avocado perfectly balanced the acidity in the ceviche.  In each bite, I tried to take some seafood, tomato, onion, and avocado.  It worked wonderfully.

Mega and DAC Market
CONTENT
Rick Bayless is known for his cookbooks, cooking shows, and restaurant, Frontera Grill, all of which are accredited for popularizing Mexican cooking in America. So when it came time for us to visit Mexico, we immediately checked his web site for recommendations and Playa Del Carmen happens to be one his favorite places. Today we visited several of his recommendations, including Mega Supermarket and DAC Market. We were not let down.Mega is a humongous superstore, if you know of Wegman's throughout the North-Eastern United States, you'll get the idea. It is massive.Their cheese section alone is the size of some supermarkets in Manhattan.As we wandered through the store, I saw a few Kirkland-brand items on the shelves and wondered if they were owned by Costco. I checked out their parent company site, CCM (Controladora Comercial Mexicana), and discovered that in 1990 they created a joint venture with Costco, to bring their products to Mexico. Since then they have opened 31 Costcos in Mexico and 70 Mega Supermarkets. They also own many other food businesses.Anyway, we enjoyed various samples, such as liverwurst with a mayonnaise-based sauce. It was too rich, even for me.We almost began to drool over their huge butcher area, cheese shop (they had a braid of Queso Blanco the size of a television), and a gorgeous bakery. We noticed a bunch of very interesting items, such as oranges and limes that had been candied and hollowed out. I'm not sure what they're used for.And super bright jellos, available as-is, or in cakes.We spent the bulk of our time closely examining each and every baked good.Unlike in the US, we walked around with tongs and placed our selections on a round tray, like a pizza pan. Then handed it to the clerk, who packaged them. In addition to breads, they had many types of doughnuts...And, many types of pastry...One of the custard-filled pastry was braided similarly to a Chinese style, often used with hot dogs.Another item, a cupcake, was decorated and looked like the familiar Hostess treats.Quite a few of the baked goods seemed to be regular breads, that were made sweet by either filling them with cream or topping them with sugar.The whole bakery was just beautiful and alluring.Perhaps the item I had the highest hopes for was a flakey pastry filled with ham and cheese and coated in fruit jam and sugar.The flavor of the pastry was standard, but it was room-temperature, so the cheese solidified and was nothing special. We thought if it were heated it might be better, but there was no toaster in sight.We also felt the Dulce de Leche-topped doughnut was average and the bread with a sugar crust was nothing to speak of. Jessica mentioned preferring the Chinese bakery look alike (bualua bao) of this second item.There were croissant-shap ed dinner rolls that tasted pretty good. I wouldn't suggest eating them plain, although they had a light butter flavor, but if I lived nearby and was having a dinner party, these would definitely be on the table.And finally the winner of the morning was the Cilantro Baguette. There was tons of fresh cilantro baked throughout the dough and the scent was wonderful. However, perhaps because of the baking process, the cilantro flavor was not overwhelming at all. It was perfectly balanced and totally enjoyable.Plus the crumb was so moist and chewy. We loved ripping it apart and eating it. Some of it made it back to the hotel with us, where we munched on it poolside, while (at least in my head) fellow guests looked on in jealousy.Back to reality for a moment. We also stopped by DAC Market, one block from Mega, and also via Rick's suggestion. It was a lovely, open air market with a rich selection of local goods, plus some foreign items. If you're a chili head like me, you'll faint at the site of their dried chili selection-cascabels the size of tomatoes! They also have a great selection of ground spices, beans, and fresh produce. I can see why anyone with a kitchen would stop here. Unfortunately, there wasn't anything for us to buy and munch on so we moved on. But not before checking out the attached smoothie stand and cookery. It looks great, but we wanted to get to La Bamba Jarocha with some room in our bellies.

Blue Lobster
CONTENT
It's always hard when you're traveling to know which restaurants will be good and which will be bad. It's a bit of a crap shoot, honestly. My preference is to ask locals and to wander around and try to figure out which places are good or bad. It's kind of random, but my gut instinct tends to be good. Jessica prefers to have a bit of a plan. So we try to do some research online and have a list of a few go to places. On this trip to Playa del Carmen, one of our safety places was Blue Lobster. Turns out it wasn't such a good idea.Blue Lobster is highly rated across most of the sites I found and has many solid reviews. For instance it's rated the #2 place on this Top 10 list and Discovery Mexico wrote a glowing review. Not to mention the number of user reviews on various sites praising it. I wonder if they went to the same place as us? The reality is, that most probably don't know good lobster from bad. After having some of the best lobster in the world, we definitely have seen the full lobster spectrum.When we arrived at Blue Lobster, there was a decent crowd, filling the two levels of seating and a lively mariachi street band playing inside. The hostess was polite and seated us at our choice of a romantic, two-seater on the street level. They brought over the painted menu and topped it on a chair in front of us. It reminded me of my lunch at Superfine. We asked a few questions and to see the lobster tails, which seemed to be the primary method of eating the lobster (other methods include in various pasta dishes, etc.). There were three sizes, big, bigger, and huge. Jessica opted for the smallest size, which was probably from a 2.5 pound lobster, and I opted for the largest, which was probably from a 4 pound lobster. The prices were reasonable for such beautiful tails from spiny lobsters (where most of the meat is in the tail). We both followed the recommendation for broiling the tail. Jessica asked for the butter and garlic sauce and I selected the white wine cream sauce.We started our meal with some warm, but otherwise plain bread. Then they delivered the Clam Chowder I ordered. Jessica and I agreed that the clams were plentiful and super tender. We enjoyed them, but felt like they were swimming in a butter sauce more than a soup. It was well flavored, but super rich.While awaiting our lobster, we warded of waves and waves of street merchants and musicians. Fortunately, it turned out the mariachi band playing when we arrived were street musicians who wandered off. They were good but incredibly loud. After they left we enjoyed our conversation at a normal volume.Our entrees arrived, and geez, they were big. And then we started eating. Uh oh. Ugh. The lobster was over-cooked. And that was only a part of the problem. The tails were not as fresh as they should've been. They were completely mediocre... at best. Neither of us finished the lobster meat, and in fact, I felt a bit nauseated from the low quality food. We both agreed it tasted like cruise food.Jessica did enjoy the side veggies (mixed broccoli, carrot, zucchini), because they were just lightly steamed, and her baked potato. I felt the veggies were boring and my side of Spaghetti Alfredo was super tiny and average.The price came to about US $115, which would've been just fine, if the food was good, but it wasn't. When you're in the neighborhood, make sure to absolutely skip this joint. It is a tourist trap and not good eating.

The problem is that your "research" consists of touristy websites not run by foodies.  At this rate you might as well have picked up a Frommers book for your restaurant choices.  If you're depending on touristy websites, you can't be surprised when you end up at a tourist trap.

Anonymous, those sites are listed as a for instance (the first two that google popped up)...because we weren't going to re-look up all the sites but it was referenced on several, plus we forgot to mention a local driver gave us the thumbs up on going when we read him a few places of our list. In any case, there really isn't a whole lot out there on Playa. Our list also includes stuff from blogs, friends, and Rick Bayless' site and it's not that long.

Pizza Pazza, Gelato Factory, Tamale Street Vendor, and Ah Cacao Chocolate Cafe
CONTENT
Friday was a long day of sampling, our favorite activity. We did sit on the beach for a little bit but lunch started calling to us and we couldn't wait to start knocking places off our wish list. Ordinarily, we wouldn't come to Mexico to eat pizza but so many rave reviews for Pizza Pazza (a chain) swayed us.After sampling the Hawaiian, a Sun-Dried Tomato and Spinach, and a Vegetable slice, we decided it's not really worth it. The dough on the Hawaiian was quite perfect, light with nice elasticity, but the dough of the other two (which should be the same dough) just seemed a little stale. The Vegetable slice was pretty boring, but the other two were quite tasty, although slightly under-seasoned. So with good pizza in NY, this didn't seem all that special.

The places in this post weren't bad, just not really a place I would send you to if you were going to Playa. We're always looking for the best. I don't think we experience more bad food than others either. We just get disappointed about average, where others may be ok with average.

El Bistro
CONTENT
We arrived in Playa Del Carmen pretty late last night so by the time we got to our hotel, La Tortuga, it was close to 10pm (which is 11pm EST). Starving (shared a sandwich on the plane) and tired, we decided to just hit the hotel restaurant. During our check-in, while sipping our sweet, mixed, fruit drinks, they told us that we get 50% off the hotel restaurant, El Bistro, for our first night. Sweet!We sat down, poolside (the pool is a nice lagoon design) to some chips and dip. The dip was extremely thick and creamy with a taste we knew but couldn't identify immediately. After asking our waiter what was in it, it made sense. He said something about chicken soup, cheese cream, some other stuff, then cream. The two types of cream explain the ultra cream taste of it and we're guessing that \"flavor\" is canned soup. Yea, not so good, and the chips were hit or miss too. Some pieces seemed freshly fried while others were stale.I ordered the Shrimp and Huitlacoche Bisque, totally excited that I was going to try huitlacoche (we had just seen this on TV). Ok, so it's a corn disease, described by words like tumors, fungus, and blue-black spores, but it's a delicacy in Mexico. The best way I can describe the taste is it's mushroom-y in a very earthy way, but also has a blue cheese quality to it. We're not sure if we like it enough because the soup was really too concentrated, more like sauce than soup, so I wasn't fond of it, but I may like it more if it was used more delicately.El Bistro is also where we had breakfast this morning because it's included in our hotel stay. For an included breakfast, it's nice that it's not a buffet. I get really sick of those on vacation. They offer something called fruit water, in a wide variety of flavors, so I tried the papaya. It's basically fruit puree in water... I guess. Lon had juice, also offered in tons of flavors, but his peach was so sweet, he couldn't drink it. I also had a latte that was too watered down.

Sun Ming Jan - Meat Candy
CONTENT
My mom took me to Sun Ming Jan Sun Ming Jan, a maker of many salted and dried meats. They are mostly a wholesaler but also sell their goods out of a little window in front. It's amazing to think these salty dried meats were originally made as a form of preservation and considered poor food.They're kind of like jerky, but I guess the Chinese version is sweeter. We tried 4 different types (that my mom recommended) which all have similar flavors and textures but do differ enough to make them interesting. The Chinese sausages are standard. They're always good, sweet and salty, chewy and fatty. The quail legs are my favorite, chewy but also tender and fun to eat off the bone. It's like a meat lollipop. Some of the chicken pieces were a little too tough, but other pieces were fine. The duck was Lon and Angie's favorite, probably the most distinct in flavor. The skin is the best part, basically duck fat candy.

Dramatic Brussels Sprouts
CONTENT
I was preparing a somewhat last minute lunch for our friend Marcos and I needed a vegetable side dish. I stared at the brussels sprouts for some time, not knowing what to do with them. I looked around at the stuff in my kitchen, glancing past the pile of stuff that is always strewn across our counters. I was about to resort to plain sprouts with garlic and olive oil, when I closed my eyes and I literally envisioned this dish! I hope you enjoy it as much as we did. It's definitely something I'd serve at a fancy dinner.Dramatic Brussels Sprouts ~3-4 servings (as a side dish)1. Boil brussels for 5 minutes. Drain ans set aside. 2. Toast sesame seeds in a skillet. (It's hard to tell with black sesame seeds when they are toasted, so I just pick some up and taste them.) 3. Add olive oil. Add brussels sprouts and cranberries. Toss around for 2 minutes. Season to taste. 4. Garnish with candied lemon zest.

What Would You Choose As Your Last Meal?

Last night's Top Chef episode is my favorite of this season's bland showing, made with not-so-fresh ingredients. At the very least, it seems like the contestants came up with good menus and delivered some tasty food. Doesn't it seem like in most episodes, the judges are just trying to figure out who was the least disappointing to win?Sorry about the tangent. What I really want to talk about is a conversation spurred by last week's episode where the Chef Hall of Famers were cooked their chosen \"last meal\". My friend Sheng asked me to post what would be mine and Lon's last meal. Believe me, ever since last week, I have been thinking about this long and hard. Is there a harder question for a food lover?Neither Lon nor I can come up with an answer. The question is just pure torture. If you have an answer, please share with us! We promise we'll keep thinking about this and get back to you...

The answer for me is simple: mac n cheese, a bacon cheeseburger, McDonald's french fries and guacamole with tortilla chips. Since the last meal means I cease to exist, I'd like to go out with a little tequila too. And a Portillo's Italian Beef sandwich.

I'd want to eat the food that brings me the happiest memories..1. eggs over easy + steamed jasmine rice + 2 tbsp. Silver Swan brand soy sauce (my dad would always make this for me growing up)2. mandarin oranges from the tree in my backyard (also ate these growing up, and there are no mandarins better than the ones that grow on this particular tree)3. a really delicious champagne, sake or wine4. an assortment of high quality sashimi prepared by a celebrated sushi chefAs you can probably tell, I've thought about this for a while ^_^

Hot Dog Hushpuppy
CONTENT
As we're getting ready to head out for a week, we're trying to empty our fridge. So when I wanted a snack last night, Jessica asked me to try to use what was in the fridge and what might go bad. We had left over breadcrumb mixture from some oreganata we made, we had fresh mozzarella, hot dogs, an egg yolk, and one potato left.What would you make? I made a Hot Dog Hushpuppy.Basically, I boiled the potato (diced), then mashed it with a touch of butter and salt. I pressed the mashed potato into a log shape and made a ditch shape in the middle. I sliced a hot dog open and lade slices of mozzarella down the center and put that into the potato. I then worked the shape into a smooth log.I whisked the egg yolk with some cold water and rolled the burgeoning hushpuppy in it, gently to hold the shape. Then I rolled that in the breadcrumb mixture. I placed it on a baking sheet and misted the outside with vegetable oil and baked it at 400 for about 20 minutes.It was delish! Jessica split it with me and we enjoyed our late snack.

Candied Meyer Lemon Zest
CONTENT
I am in love with Meyer Lemons! You can just sit them on your counter and enjoy the incredible scent. Of course, we actually used them though. More on that later, but don't forget to use the zest too. The most incredible mist sprays out at you as you peel it, making the process just as enjoyable as the result.Candied Meyer Lemon Zest-adapted from RecipeTips.com1. Wash lemons thoroughly. Trim zest from lemons using a vegetable peeler. Cut wide strips, being careful not to cut into the white pith layer below. Cut zest strips lengthwise to create thin julienne strips.2. Place julienne strips in a small sauce pan and cover with cold water. Cook over medium heat until the water comes to a simmer. Continue to simmer for 6 minutes.3. Remove from heat, drain strips and then return them to the sauce pan. Add water and sugar to the lemon strips in the sauce pan. Bring the mixture to a simmer. Continue to cook over low heat until the lemon strips turn translucent. The water and sugar should be starting to thicken. Cooking time will be approximately 10 to 15 minutes.4. When done cooking, remove strips from the pan and spread out on a sheet of wax paper. Separate the strips on the wax paper so they are not in clumps.5. Once they have cooled slightly, roll in the two sugars until they are well coated. I used about 3/4 turbinado and 1/4 white sugar.

Over-cooked veggies drive me nuts and spinach tops that list for one of the worst offenders. Perfectly cooked spinach is wonderful though, and you'll see that my method is super easy. I use this for last-minute guests all the time.First, make sure your spinach is washed and dried. I like to use a salad spinner to get all excess water off. Heat a pan with olive oil.

How Much Do You Eat?
CONTENT
At dinner the other night, we had a fun conversation about the variety of foods each of us would consider eating. I described a way of graphing the edible food universe for each person as an area chart in two axes: one for the variety of breadth of foods and one for the quality of foods.For instance, both Jessica and I eat a very wide breadth of foods, we love almost everything. However, Jessica demands a pretty high quality of the foods, she won't eat low quality; while I'm less demanding on quality.So for fun, I put together this totally non-scientific graphing application to show and tell you just how much of the food universe YOU eat. Just answer the few questions and you'll quickly know. Jessica eats 48% and I eat 84% of food.

African-Style Stewed Skate
CONTENT
Jessica chose a Moroccan dish to prepare for Sophia & Justin last night. We had picked up a large skate wing (about 1.75 pounds) in Chinatown without deciding what to do with it. So when she asked me to figure out what to do, I decided to stick with with the continental theme, rather than national. I started researching African fish recipes and found that quite a number of them had a similar style. Since I've eaten African a few times, I figured I could come up with my own recipe, inspired by the recipes I found online.It was a fun, surprising dish for us. Usually we cook fish in about two minutes to keep it tender. This dish had a much longer cooking time; in fact, some recipes called for cooking it almost 6 hours! It was also fun for me to practice my knife skills, since I had to bone and skin the wing myself (there was apparently a communication error at the fish monger).The result was a tangy, saucy dish with tender fish. We finished every drop.African-Style Stewed Skate~makes 4 servingsIngredientsInstructions

Bill - Great idea!  We think we'll do that.Duo - Funny you mention it... at dinner Justin asked if the sauce would be suitable for chicken.  My thinking is that it could work well for chicken, but I'd substitute chicken stock for the fish stock.  Also, you'd probably have to stew the chicken a bit longer, like 45-60 minutes (just guessing).

Tips on Flan and My Big Boo Boo
CONTENT
Sophia has been craving flan so I offered to make it for her. I picked out a highly rated recipe and started working. I noticed that the recipe leaves out a lot of detail in terms of technique so I was hoping I'd remember all that stuff I learned in culinary school. So, here are some tips (that should apply for any flan recipe).1. The big one that I forgot (D'oh! I haven't made flan in about 6 years) is NOT to whisk the ingredients together. It creates air bubbles that resulted in ugly holes. Just combine gently with a spatula or wooden spoon. It's a nice extra to strain the combination again, but be careful not to incorporate air into the mixture.2. While you are preheating the oven, heat the pie plate in it so that the caramelized sugar spreads more easily and more evenly when you pour it in.3. To brown the sugar, spread the sugar in a cold saute pan and turn it to medium low, stay on the low side. Don't stir, just wait till it browns a bit, then shake the pan. Let some more brown, then shake again. Continue until it's all caramelized. Pour into the heated pie plate and tilt around until the bottom is evenly covered.4. Bake the flan in a water bath.5. After it's done baking, cool completely on the counter top, cover with plastic wrap, and chill overnight. When it's time to serve, dip the under-side of the pie plate in hot water to loosen. You may need to loosen the edges with a pairing knife as well. Invert onto serving platter.*Notes on this particular recipe:It's too much custard for a 9″ pie plate so don't over-fill. This flan is a little denser than most, but pretty standard otherwise.

Oysters and Steamers

For Valentine's Day, we hopped down to Chinatown to pick up some fresh seafood (we both love seafood) and for me, I like seafood as simple as possible. The Virginia oysters were shucked (shucking is harder than it looks when you're not well practiced) and slurped up with a raspberry mignonette.These happened to be the meatiest steamers I've ever had. Each one filled the shell to the very brim.Just in case you haven't eaten steamers before, make sure to pull away that black skin. You want to get the grey stuff that goes around the rim and then pull the skin off the neck.

Jessica, Thanks for visiting.  I just broiled some oysters last week.  Yes, they are hard to shuck, but I found it was much easier shucking with an oyster knife than with a screwdriver which I tried the last time!  Your meal looks splendid.

The Roasting Plant
CONTENT
We just happened to walk by The Roasting Plant The Roasting Plant today, and seeing a sign that said they brew by the cup, drew me right in. Remember that place I love in San Francisco, Philz? Grinding and brewing each cup to order does make a big difference. The Roasting Plant takes it a notch up on the technology side with their Roasting Plant Javabot. This thing sucks up measured amounts of raw green beans and moves it across the store to where it's roasted, ground, and then brewed as you wait. The friendly guy behind the counter was happy to make a suggestion since there are a lot of choices, tons of organic and fair trade. I can't remember exactly what he gave me, a mix of something from Papua New Guinea and somewhere else, but it was incredibly smooth and aromatic. (The store also smells heavenly.) I prefer something a little bolder but he told me this one was mid-way among their beans so I'm sure I can find a better fit next time. The prices are very reasonable and I only wish one of their two locations was near me.I can't wait to go back and try more beans and blends. I have high hopes that I'll find my perfect cup here.Update 2/15/09 - I went to the West Village location The Roasting Plant today (which turns out to be closer to me than I thought) and got the Indian Monsoon one. It has good flavor but it's too bitter for me. I'll try another one soon.

The Food Cellar
CONTENT
After eating breakfast and checking e-mails in the morning, we spontaneously decided to head out to Long Island City and check out some condos. We put apartment hunting on hold for some time now, but we decided it would be fun to see an area we know little about, do some information gathering.The brokers told us about the new supermarket, The Food Cellar Food Cellar & Co. Market, the only one in the area, which looks a little like Whole Foods, a little like Amish Market, and a little like a supermarket in the suburbs. Of course we wanted to check it out, and conveniently, it was lunch time!On the grocery side, it's pretty expensive, even by Manhattan standards, so I wouldn't shop their regularly, but I guess you have no choice if you live in the area. On the flip side, the prepared foods look really good. Lon and I both got amazing sandwiches for lunch and they were very well priced (mine was $6.98 and Lon's was $7.98).At the pizza station, I saw the pizza guy making a sandwich for another customer. The bread looked so good. They call it oven bread and the guy told me to get one from the bread department and he'd make me any sandwich I wanted.I chose prosciutto, mozzarella, caramelized onions, and he suggested some arugula. He then carefully heated it so that the mozzarella was melted but the prosciutto was only lightly heated, which maintains that fabulous prosciutto texture.Lon followed and chose a focaccia bread with tomato and cheese on top.He stuffed his sandwich with olive tapenade, spicy Italian sausage, tons of roasted garlic, fresh mozzarella, and olive oil.Both of us were impressed by the thought our sandwich artist put into structuring the sandwiches and cooking them, so that the super fresh ingredients were evenly cooked, and the cheese was gooey. The bread had a wonderful chewiness and we couldn't hold back, we at them entirely. We could've been full half way (they were big), but that's not our style.This is definitely a good reason to consider LIC.

Top Chef Update (Finalists)
CONTENT
We watched Episode 12 of Top Chef last night (spoilers coming). To say the least, we're not crazy about this season of the show, although we still watch it -- we love the cooking.If you recall, after the first episode in November I made some predictions about the results. A month into the show, Emily, our friend and reader, suggested that I underestimated the women; and today pointed out that I definitely under estimated Carla. I figured it was worth checking the numbers, so here they are:There are a couple of ways to interpret these results. Here's my interpretation. It looks like I definitely over-estimate the men, on average they were kicked off 3.8 episodes earlier than expected. But it was a mixed bag with the women, the major outliers were Radhika and Jill. Jill was kicked off much earlier than I expected and Radhika much later.I'm not upset about Jill, as I originally said, I took a random guess with her. But Radhika is a different story. Both her and Carla fit Carla's description of the tortoise in the race. They were bland and boring, and didn't belong in a \"TOP\" Chef competition. The fact that Carla has made it into the finale makes me ill. She seems like a sweet, good-intentioned person, who is probably a fine cook. But in no way on earth does the person who hides behind the same pastry dish on three episodes belong in the finale.Also, I did respond in December that I had underestimated Radhika, but continued my prediction that she would be off soon enough, and she was kicked off, two episodes after my comment. There were other issues as well. Episode six didn't see anyone leave the show, due to some technical issues. And they accepted four contestants into the finale this year.At the end of the day, we enjoy watching cooking, but remind ourselves that this show is heavily produced and there's a lot of influence during the judging to keep the show interesting. Oh well. (p.s. I'm sticking with Stefan as the winner)

I underestimated Carla as well. I didn't think her flaky crusts would get her that far. I was blown away by her pleasing Jacques Pepin. Will she win? IMHO I say no, but she has proven she deserves to be in contention.

I don't understand the animosity towards Stefan. He can cook. I don't find him arrogant. He just wins challenges and you don't!In that vein, why is Hosea SOOOO obsessed with Stefan! It's always, Stefan this, Stefan that. I swear he's in love with him.
Phi
2009-02-13 23:38:00
I totally thought Carla was going to go home early. In my opinion based on what I saw and heard from the judges, Leah should have gone home last episode instead of Jamie and Stefan should have gone home this episode. Overcooked salmon > runny eggs in terms of whats worse.
Emily
2009-02-14 10:54:00
Your chart is misleading, b/c you only factor in how far off you were for people who have already been kicked off, and therefore don't factor in the biggest outlier - Carla, who will end up being on for at least 11 more episodes than you predicted.I'm with Liverpool - earlier on I thought that all she could really do was make a delicious crust, but the past few episodes she's been consistently at or near the top in both quickfires and elimination challenges.  It definitely seems like she merits a place on the show, though I would still be surprised if she won.I'm disappointed that Jamie is gone though.  I would've liked to have seen her in the finals.
Bill G
2009-02-14 11:18:00
The scoring system for top chef is flawed.  It drives me nuts.  Basically you can be the best chef for six weeks in a row and then get kicked off for one mistake.  The way it should work is that each week the contestant's dishes should be judged by some point criteria and the chef with the lowest cumulative points for that week (adding the points from all previous weeks to the current week) should be eliminated.  It might reduce some of the drama, but it is a much fairer system.
Jessica@Foodmayhem
2009-02-14 11:27:00
Generally, I'm not impressed by the chefs this season. Too many people just cook simple things well, which makes a good chef, not a Top Chef. Carla and Ariane both got too far for that.Pearl, Carla's facial expressions actually freak me out a bit, but I love Fabio. His cooking seems hit or miss but his accent and his odd metaphors are hilarious. He'd be better for a TV show then opening a restaurant.TS, Lon feels the same way about Stefan.Phi, you bring up one of the main things that disappoint me about this season. I think the show is now over-produced and they are keeping people on or kicking people off partly based on production value. Leah lasted longer than she should have because they wanted to wait till she hooked up with Hosea. They wouldn't kick off Stefan even though it does seem he should have lost that time. This is because he's so argumentative and combative...he's too good for the show. Now that they built up the Hosea/Stefan rivalry (which like TS mentioned is really only in Hosea's mind), I'm pretty sure they will be the last two standing...and it's not necessarily because they deserve to be.Emily, the chart is not misleading but the calculation of avg's is. Carla still hasn't won me over. I don't think she should've been able to win twice for the same thing and now she's kind of doing the Ariane thing....winning for nothing special.Overall, I'm so disappointed in this season that I don't really even care to watch anymore. I would like to see Fabio host his own food/comedy show though.

I am not thrilled with these season, usually I am kinda bored with the episodes. Jamie shouldn't have gotten kicked off. But whatever, I don't really have any loyalty towards any of them.

Top Chef this season doesn't have to have much talent. Hosea hasn't cooked anything that really was that interesting; Jamie, although she seems to have more chops, just keeps making soups and scallops. Leah hasn't really done anything of note, as have not Fabio or Carla. The challenges have been boring -- Superbowl challenge? What the heck.

Shepherd's PIE
CONTENT
It has always bothered me that Shepherd's pie isn't really a pie. The standard recipe is just a meat and veggie mixture thrown in a baking dish with mashed potatoes on top. What happened to the best part of the pie?!? The flaky buttery crust?!? Fear not! I have a remedy.Shepherd's PIECrustTop CrustFillingfinishInstructions-1. Combine flour and salt in a large bowl. Cut in butter and shortening until it looks coarse and crumbly. Sprinkle ice water while tossing together with a fork. Form a ball and wrap in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes (proceed to make the rest).2. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Simmer potatoes in a small pot with salted water until fork tender (how long will depend on how big you cut the pieces).3. Strain potatoes, and return to the same pot. Mash and mix in buttermilk and butter. Season to taste. Remove from heat and set aside.4. In a large skillet, heat vegetable oil on medium heat. Add onions and carrots, stir around until softened, about 3 minutes. Crumble beef with your hand and spread across the pan. Stir until browned.5. Add beef broth, Worcestershire, and dried oregano. Stir around until there is only a thin layer of liquid left on the bottom. Sprinkle the flour on and stir in (it will absorbs the rest of the liquid). Stir in peas. Season to taste. Remove from heat and set aside.6. Roll out dough and lay into a 9″ pie plate.7. Spoon in meat mixture.8. Spread mashed potatoes on top of meat mixture. Scratch with a fork to make it bumpy.9. Bake for 22 minutes. Sprinkle cheddar on top. Bake for another 8 minutes. Serve immediately.Pie is not just for dessert.

Jessica, I've never seen a Shepherd's Pie with a crust. Nor have I ever questioned why it was called a "pie" in the first place. And, in the second place, all shepherd pies ought to look as good as yours. I'm married to a guy who would absolutely love this, and so would I.

Looks tasty as hell, but it's still not a real shepherd's pie unless it's made with ground lamb, not beef :\If I get ahold of some lamb and have the opportunity to try this, though, I'll give it a shot.

Liverpool68, you could try blind baking the crust but it's not necessary and just adds more work. Let me know how yours turns out either way.Marysol, let me know if you make it for your hubby.Jittero, I figured I was breaking rules, adding crust and cheese. "Real" was more of a joke.

When I lived in England, I couldn't understand why they didn't use a crust! I make mine with a crust both underneath the other ingredients and as a top crust, and when I'm feeling really lazy I use store bought dinner rolls. I think it's something about the "pop" the packaging makes when you open the seam...I've never thought of using cheese though-thanks for that!!

Scallop Pancakes
CONTENT
These little seafood pancakes were inspired by a recipe I saw Jacques Pepin cook up; if you didn't know already, that guy is my cooking hero. I put a bit of an Oriental spin on them and they came out almost like Korean seafood pancakes, which we love. I'm not sure this is a perfect recipe, but it's pretty good!Scallop Pancakes~makes about 6-8 pancakes (depending on size)IngredientsInstructions1. In a small, heavy-bottom sauce pot, saute parsnip with a good amount of kosher salt over low heat in oil until softened, about 5 minutes. Add scallops, garlic, white part of scallions, and white pepper. Cook until scallops start to get a bit of color. Remove all contents to a bowl, reserve.2. In same sauce pot, melt butter with 1 tbsp. of the flour. Stir continuously over a low heat, to create a roux. Continually stir for about 4 minutes. Stir in milk & curry powder, until well combined. Add back reserved scallop mixture along with remaining flour. Continue to stir until thoroughly combined and very thick. Remove from heat. Use a stick blender to puree until fairly smooth. Stir in baking powder and scallion greens.3. Press about 2 tablespoons at a time into a small frying pan with plenty of vegetable oil in it. Try to get the pancake very flat. As soon as slightly cooked on the bottom (about 20-30 seconds), flip once and flatten again. Cook for about 60 seconds, and flip again. Cook another 45 seconds. Don't overcook.4. Serve with Sriracha (chili-garlic sauce) and extra scallions.I also tried baking a few. They came out pretty good, with a slightly dryer texture. Jessica preferred the fried. To bake, just throw them on a baking sheet at 375 degrees F for 9 minutes per side.

It's a bit hard to tell for certain which of the celebrity chefs have the best knife skills, because they only demonstrate some of them on tv.  That said, I think overall Pepin has the best technique, but if I was to give the best knife skills title out 1st place would go to Japanese Iron Chef Hiroyuki Sakai (the French one).  And 2nd place would go to Martin Yan (of "Yan Can Cook" fame).  That guy is sick.  'chop chop chop'.  But then third would go to Pepin.  But I'll repeat, he is my chef hero.

Mixer Made Soft Pretzels
CONTENT
Soft pretzels are so New York, and I wouldn't be a responsible New Yorker if I didn't post about pretzels. These are not like the street pretzels, but they are the best pretzels I've ever eaten, super soft and pillow-y with a bit of sweetness in the dough. I've adapted this recipe for a stand mixer so you don't have to knead them by hand.Mixer Made Soft Pretzels~makes 12, adapted from Buttery Soft PretzelsInstructions -1. In a small bowl combine warm water, 1 teaspoon of white sugar, and yeast. Let stand for 10 minutes or until creamy.2. Put 3 1/2 cups flour, 1/2 cup sugar, and both salts in the bowl of your stand mixer. Mix with the paddle attachment for a few seconds. Add vegetable oil and yeast mixture and just mix until moistened.3. Switch to dough hook and knead on low for 5 minutes. Add in the remaining cup of flour while dough is kneading. You can add up to 2 tablespoons of water if dough looks dry.4. When dough is done kneading, place in a large oiled bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and let it rise till doubled in size, about an hour.5. Preheat oven 450 degrees F, 30 minutes before you are baking. Spray a baking sheet with non-stick.6. Dissolve baking soda in hot water.7. When dough has risen, turn it out onto a floured surface and divide into 12 equal pieces. Roll each piece into a rope, roughly 1/2″ diameter.8. Shape into pretzels, gently pressing ends down to attach. After all pretzels are shaped, dip them into the baking soda/water and place on baking sheet. Bake for 8 minutes, or until golden brown.9. As soon as they come out of the oven, brush generously with melted butter. Sprinkle with salt or cinnamon sugar. Eat!

Omen
CONTENT
As I waited for my friend Sheryl to arrive at Omen Omen, I read through the menu. It was a bit confusing, and I actually thought I was missing some pages. (The wait staff must have thought it was weird as I started flipping through the menu left for my friend.) The menu starts with four pages, each with a pre-fixed dinner described, starting at $70 and up. I didn't feel like spending so much at an average looking place. I flipped to the end where it says A la Carte but there was no separation for appetizers and entrees, a few things had sizes, while most didn't, and some items looked like they were repeated in English, but different in Japanese. Yes, you can just ask the waitress to explain everything which they will happily and almost adequately do, but couldn't they just get someone to help them write a better menu? I digress.So, there's a sashimi option with the standard type of fish, but no rolls and no sushi, so I took that as a cue that, that's probably not their thing. My friend Sheryl did have the sashimi which she enjoyed though.

Valentine's Plans 2009
CONTENT
We always say food is love, and with Valentine's coming up, we're getting hungry. Have you seen that episode of Seinfeld when George tries to eat a sandwich while having sex? Let's just say, we understand (and no, we don't eat sandwiches while having sex).Well, this year, the economy kind of stinks and everyone wants to save money. We have two inexpensive ideas for you:1. When Lon and I first started dating, he won me over by bringing me little treats. I would meet up with him and he'd have a simple brown paper bag in his hand, nothing fancy, but there was always a great treat inside. It's the little things that can really put a smile on anyone's face. The saying goes, \"The way to a man's heart is through his stomach\" but it goes both ways. Don't think us girls cannot be bribed too. Anyways here are a few things you can grab around the city that we think are yummy and inexpensive. If you really want to impress, you can buy a different one every day leading up to V-day.2. We don't like going out to restaurants on Valentine's Day. Cooking at home saves money and can be so much more intimate (see V-day dinner from last year). Here's a list of ideas and/or recipes we've posted that are V-day color appropriate (red/pink, etc.):We hope this helps you and results in sweet smiles from your food valentine! Happy Valentine's!

"we don't eat sandwiches while having sex" - if only because the sandwich would fall apart, right?  Hahaha I am so joking.  That's... unappetizing.  Anyways, I love the "I (food3 you" - one of my fave movies 'Love & Sex' has this great line that devolves into 'I cheese sandwich you' (although it's used derisively) that I've always liked(it won't let me use carats above so ignore my non-heart)

Getting To Know Scones: Part 4
CONTENT
Following up on Part 1, 2, and 3, is probably my final post on this subject, as I have now found my favorite scone recipe, and I'm now also pretty sick of scones. In The King Arthur Flour Baker's Companion, I found an Apricot Cream Cheese Scone recipe and I was certainly intrigued. Cream cheese doughs are always fantastic, right? Well, I didn't have any apricots and they're not in season anyway so I used organic frozen wild blueberries and also added a glaze just for kicks.Blueberry Cream Cheese Scones with Meyer Lemon GlazeMeyer Lemon GlazeInstructions-1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F.2. In a large bowl, whisk together flour, cornstarch, sugar, baking powder, and salt. Cut in butter and cream cheese with a fork, pastry cutter, or fingers, until it resembles coarse sand.3. In a small bowl, whisk together milk, egg, and vanilla extract.4. Mix liquid and blueberries into dry mixture, only stirring till combined. Do not over-mix.5. Turn out onto a floured surface and fold a few times until you can get it to stick together. It may be a bit dry and harder to work with but work quickly. Pat down to 3/4″ thick and cut with a 2 1/2″ to 3″ circle cutter. Push remaining dough together and cut again.6. Place the scones on an un-greased cookie sheet 2 inches apart and bake for 8 minutes. Turn off the oven (do not open the oven door) and continue to cook for 8 minutes or until light golden brown. Remove from oven.7. Whisk together confectioner's sugar and lemon juice and drizzle over scones. Serve warm immediately.Lon and I love this recipe. It's really packed with flavor and it has that great texture I like, crumbly on the outside, and the moist full bodied dough inside. If you like the lighter fluffy kind, use the Blueberry Vanilla Sugar Recipe in Part 1.Also, I read a tip in The King Arthur Flour Baker's Companion. They recommend putting the scones on baking sheets and then sticking them in the freezer for 30 minutes or longer before baking, to make the scones lighter and fluffier. I couldn't try this because my freezer is full to the brim right now.

Justin's Birthday Dinner: Easy-to-Eat Food
CONTENT
Remember when we talked about Easy-to-Eat vs Hard-to-Eat food? Well, my brother Justin leans way on the side of preferring easy-to-eat foods. While he loves shellfish, he hates peeling and cracking. Fork to mouth without a knife is best. Naturally, we thought the perfect birthday present would be a dinner of easy-to-eat foods. We started with pears and pita wedges with a Winter Feta Dip, because dips just seem to be a poster child for easy-to-eat foods.Our second course was Clams Oreganata, an easy one bite dish. Of course, we had to put the work in ahead of time shucking the clams.

Bacon-Wrapped Tiger Prawns over Slaw
CONTENT
Justin really enjoyed the Bacon-Wrapped Scallops last month, so for his birthday (another post with more about his birthday dinner coming up), we had to improve upon those! We picked up some plump tiger prawns and got to work. Our plan was to wrap them in thin bacon, and deep fry them with a panko crust. Instead of a sauce, we came up with a flavorful slaw to accompany the dish.Pineapple Ginger SlawIngredientsInstructionsBacon-Wrapped Tiger PrawnIngredientsInstructions1. Pre-heat oil in a narrow, tall sauce pot (or deep fryer) to about 325-350 degrees. I don't usually check with a thermometer, but use the wood dowel technique (check for bubbling).2. Skewer each prawn with a short, thin skewer. Make sure to keep the prawn perfectly straight. Cut a section of pounded bacon to wrap the prawn with just 1/4 inch of overlap. Don't cover the tail.3. Pour panko into a semi-flat bowl. In a similar, separate bowl, whip egg whites until very frothy. Dip each skewer first into the egg whites and coat well, then into the panko, and coat well.4. Fry a few at a time for about 2-3 minutes, until golden brown. Then drain excess oil on a paper towel.To serve, fill a large bowl with the slaw and rest the hot prawns on top. Advise your diners to eat the two together.

what constitutes a slaw
Lon
2009-02-09 16:52:00
Pearl - Well, some think prawn are fresh water and shrimp are salt water, but since species are known to live in both, that doesn't work.  Biologists, however, indicate that prawn are a different species that are best indicated by the types of gills.  Shrimp have plate-like gills and prawn have furry, branch-like gills.  That said, in the food world, it is widely accepted that any large shrimp-like creature may be called a prawn, without much backlash, typically U15 or larger (these were just a touch smaller, but are actually prawn).  If they're really big, or actually small lobster (another common mistake), they're referred to as scampi.Eatingfoodboy - Well, the term derives from Coleslaw, which is any salad made of shredded cabbage.  However, Jessica and I think that any cold salad of shredded ingredients can be called a slaw safely.  Also, we think of them as side dishes, never main salads.
Justin
2009-02-09 17:01:00
Lon, you think it's safe, but it's not. And having heard that the slaw replaced a sauce, I'd like to state for the record that a sauce is easier to eat than a slaw, and that I much prefer sauces.Eatingfoodboy, when are you going to come to NY and eat with your cousin frosty. I ask because I will likely be able to tag along.I'm Justin, and I ate this.

Deep Dish Pizza
CONTENT
Jessica has been wanting to make pizza all week. We stopped by Home Depot to buy some quarry tile to use as a pizza stone, but go figure, the Manhattan HDs don't stock tile. So she decided on deep dish, as we don't need a stone and because neither of us had really experimented much (at least in recent years) with deep dish.We weren't much impressed with the two deep dish joints we tried in Chicago (Gino's East and Lou Malnati's), but home made might be better. Jess found a recipe for what is purported to be the most authentic, at least for home production. Unlike NY pizza dough recipes, which are super easy (I make them all the time), the Chicago dough needs a lot of work. It also needs about twice the time a NY dough needs. Unfortunately, the recipe was lacking a lot of detail, so I'm updating the recipe here, with much more detail.This recipe makes two 10-inch deep dish pies. We made one with just sauce & cheese, the other with hot Italian sausage and black olive. Both were good. Unfortunately, we misread our can of crushed tomatoes and used 35 ounces instead of 28 and resulted in soupy sauce, but it was yummy nonetheless.Chicago-Style Deep Dish Pizza Doughadapted from the recipe on J.J. Schnebel's site~makes two 10-inch piesAlong the right you can see images of the dough rising throughout. This dough really bulks up during the rising process!IngredientsInstructionsBuilding a Chicago Deep Dish Pizzaadapted from the recipe on J.J. Schnebel's site~makes two 10-inch piesIn its simplest form, the only ingredients you need are sauce and cheese. Those are the foundation for anything else you may add. Like the dough recipe, the ingredients below are enough for two pies.IngredientsInstructions1. Place a layer of the mozzarella slices on the dough. Then spread the garlic on top of the cheese.2. If adding any other ingredients, lay them thinly on top of the cheese & garlic.3. In a separate bowl, crush plum tomatoes, and combine herbs. Spread evenly over the ingredients in the pies.5. Finally, liberally add Parmesan cheese.6. Bake uncovered in a pre-heated, 475 degree F oven for 35-40 minutes, until the sauce is bubbling and the crust is golden-brown and tapping it sounds hollow.7. Let cool for about two minutes, before slicing and serving. Serve directly from dish, do not remove.It reheats well and tastes good later!!More pictures in the Flickr Set.

Superfine
CONTENT
Loren and I hit up Superfine Superfine in DUMBO for lunch on Friday. I love the restaurant name, but wasn't as impressed with anything else. The food is ok, the service is mediocre, the decor is eclectic, and the prices are average.There aren't many restaurants to choose from under the Manhattan bridge, so it wasn't hard choosing Superfine, or finding it, it's just two blocks from the York Street station of the F-train. I walked into what was half-bar / half-restaurant. On the left there's a long bar with a large liquor selection, and to the right, a red-felt pool table. In the back, an oddly decorated seating area, with what looks like second hand furniture, not unusual in the local Brooklyn restaurant scene. Think Hawaii meets Grandma's basement.I sat at a wobbly table for two and one waitress brought over a ragged chair with the following sign taped on:She then sat upon it a hand-written, whiteboard menu. I liked that it indicated the freshness of the menu and the fact that it probably changes. Although she pointed out that the burger and the grilled chicken are the most popular items, indicating they probably don't vary much.While I waited a few minutes for Loren, I noticed the small sign on the table:I got excited about a really fresh meal, with great tasting ingredients.I could've eaten anything off the menu. Loren opted for the waitress' recommendation of the burger, which I believe he's had before. I went for the Grilled Chicken.The menu said it had pancetta, but in fact it was something more like Canadian bacon. The watercress and aioli were there however, as was a large side of Superfine Fries. They were thin shoe string, perfectly fried, but under-seasoned. I asked for some additional aioli and was informed it would be 75 cents extra, I was also informed they don't have plain mayo (for free or otherwise). I paid the 75 cents, but felt like it was awkward to charge for it. As long as I'm nit picking about condiments, I pointed out to Loren how gelatinous the ketchup looked (can you tell in the picture?). It didn't move at all when I shook the plate and had an incredibly smooth, glossy surface. Loren suggested that it might have been refrigerated, but it wasn't cold at all. It tasted like normal ketchup though.My sandwich was fine (normal grilled chicken on ciabatta), the fries were fine, and aioli was also fine. The service was remarkably slow every step of the way. It was about 10-15 minutes to get our food and almost a puzzle on how to get a check.In the end I think their name is perfect. They are stellar, super-even at being just \"fine\". If you're in the 'hood, try one of the other restaurants, not much to see here.

Getting To Know Scones: Part 3
CONTENT
I hope you've read part 1 and part 2, and as I promised, I would report on yesterdays scones, today. A day later, the sour cream scones (our preference over the yogurt version) are definitely not as good, but not terrible. I tried toasting them and that does revive them quite a bit.Because I have way too much left-over scones right now (do you see this?), and we're a bit sconed out, I'll resume this experiment Monday and give myself a break for the weekend. Of course, we'll have plenty of other goodies to post about.Continue to Getting to Know Scones: Part 4.

Blue Ribbon Sushi Bar & Grill
CONTENT
Last night, I headed over to Blue Ribbon Sushi Bar & Grill Blue Ribbon Sushi Bar & Grill, embedded in the Six Columbus hotel, for a casual celebration of Winnie's Birthday. We started with a nice fatty cut of thinly sliced Kanpachi sashimi dabbed with yuzu and Japanese pepper.The Blue Ribbon Style Fried Chicken is fried nicely, no greasiness at all, but the flavor is uninteresting. The wasabi honey sauce is a nice idea and helps the under-seasoned chicken, but doesn't transform it.

Getting To Know Scones: Part 2

Before we get to the two new versions I made today, let's talk about the ones from yesterday again (read part 1 first). Well, they simply don't taste great the next day. The Blueberry Vanilla Sugar one (made with milk) holds up a bit better, still soft and moist, although just not as fresh tasting. The Chocolate Chip Scones (made with buttermilk) dry out more, the flavor becomes a bit stale, and the outside gets something like a skin, a little plastic-like. I didn't bother trying the Cream Scones again because I didn't like them enough yesterday.Today, I used this recipe, Grandma Johnson's Scones, and made one version with sour cream and one with yogurt (Trader Joe's Greek-style yogurt). The yogurt version needed to be baked longer and puffed up more. The texture is the same inside and out, which is ok on the inside but doesn't give you that crumbly outside I like. The biggest problem is that the flavor is very flat, tasting of just flour and sugar.The sour cream version is pretty good, but bakes up a little flatter. The outside is a bit more crumbly, with a few more bumps, which I like. The subtle flavor adds a lot. Although not perfect, I'd happily eat these again.We'll see how these taste tomorrow. BTW, I'm ok with a recipe that only tastes good day of (some things are just that way), but the ones they make at Our Daily Bread are good for at least 2 days, so it would be nice to get a longer lasting recipe.OK, gotta go figure out what to test tomorrow...Continue to Getting to Know Scones: Part 3

Getting To Know Scones: Part 1
CONTENT
I love scones and so do my friends, but it seems, everyone likes a different type of scone. I'm not talking about flavors, although I'm sure everyone has flavor preferences too. I'm talking more about the texture, the crumb, the moisture, the density.I know what I like. My favorite scones are the ones from Our Daily Bread, and I'm pretty fond of the ones at Alice's Tea Cup as well. So when I started looking for a scone recipe, I found tons of well rated ones, all very different, all with reviews saying things like, \"best scones...\" and I was at a loss. Knowing that there are such varying tastes on scones, I decided to test out several different recipes, in hopes of two results: 1. I hope to divine the ultimate recipe for the way I like scones. 2. I hope that through my testing and reporting, you'll get closer to finding your favorite recipe, without having to make quite as many versions as I have.Today, I started with three scones recipes, one made with milk, one with heavy cream, and one with buttermilk. I know this would be way more scientific if I used the exact same recipes only varying the milk/cream/buttermilk, but I really don't want to be eating the same flavor all day long so, this is what you're getting. The different flavors should not affect the texture too much so lessons will still be learned, and that's enough for me.1. The first recipe uses milk.Blueberry Vanilla Sugar Scones~adapted from a basic recipeInstructions-2. The next one, Miniature Cream Scones with Currants, is from epicurious and uses heavy cream. They also differ in size and use cake flour. (Note: The recipe says to bake for 15-18 minutes but it was done in 10 minutes.)My only fear is that the chocolate may actually be influencing this batter (different from dried fruits because it melts into the batter) so I will likely try another version of this with another flavor, and not chocolate.Tomorrow, I will also be testing recipes with sour cream and yogurt. Let me know if you have any questions or suggestions. I will try to cover as much as possible.Continue to Getting to Know Scones: Part 2.

Remember when we covered the opening of Totally Baked? Less than a year later, well, they're gone. No big surprise. The food was ok, but expensive; they over-spent on the decor and on packaging; and the logistics were a nightmare. It was a cute idea while it lasted, albeit impractical.So, Chef & Co. has regained the space and turned it into Song Sushi, a place hocking unexciting, over-priced sushi and a few cooked items. It looks like a take-out counter. How long will this one last?

Moshe's Falafel
CONTENT
We've been noticing Moshe's Falafel for a while now, parked on 17th Street, just east of 5th Ave. (There's another one in midtown.) You can't really miss it. It's not a cart. I think it's a refurbished RV.We just wanted to try it, so it's nice that they sell a \"half\" sandwich, which actually looks like a whole though. It's only two falafels opposed to the three in most regulars (don't know how big their whole is). Each falafel is really big so quantity wise, it's decent for $3.50.The problem is that we think the falafel is good texturally (the one on top was crunchy on the outside and fluffy on the inside) but taste wise, it's too hard to tell because of how over-drenched it is with tahini and hot sauce. Everything just ends up tasting like tahini, which is now spilling all over your gloves already. That may be a good thing for the vegetables (which are frozen cause it's too cold these days). The tomatoes are practically white and in a blind taste test, I'm not sure I could identify them. We liked that they included pickles but it would be nice if they were chopped because each piece is larger than bite size. So ehh, wouldn't miss them if they decided to park somewhere else.

Moishe's is not good in my opinion. Falafel is greasy and flavorless and the balls are too large, giving wrong texture / substance ratio.  The only thing it has going for it is price.  If you want best falafel in NYC I think the new champ is Taim in the Village.  They got it going on until dawn like Ron and John playing Robotron.

Winter Feta Dip and Pear Crudite
CONTENT
The concept of crudite and dip is an old classic. It's irresistible for parties because it's easy, you can make it ahead, and some call it healthy. For a new twist, try my version. I happen to think the flavor of the dip pairs (pun-intended) well with pears, but of course it will still be great with a more classic crudite, like carrots, celery, and bell peppers. Of course, you could dip chips too.Winter Feta Dip with Pear CruditePlace all ingredients except pears in a blender or food processor and combine. Serve with pears.

purelilyliving, I didn't squeeze lemon juice on them because we were eating them immediately. Also if you slice it with a ceramic knife they will take longer to brown. If you do want to use lemon juice, I don't think it will be a problem.

As a reminder, FoodMayhem is all about... food! However, photos of food are a critical part of our site, so we have been trying to improve our photography. Jessica's cousin Steve is a wonderful photographer and has provided some interesting guidance, that we'll share with the world.We were considering various diffusers and Steve suggested that:Well we did just that. And while there are crazier diffusers, this one is pretty funny -- but really works!The following shows the results of various configurations. All of these were shot at 1/80; f/7.1; ISO 200.I definitely think the Fruit Diffuser Up configuration is the most natural. The image is bright and there are no hard specular points on the plastic.In addition to the fruit diffuser looking great, it is using a free product that is from food! What do you think?

Lon/Jess, 2 thumbs up for the "fruit diffuser up"!  To my eye it adds more depth (Z-index) and thus makes the image much less flat.  Cool re-use of materials for extra points.  Now I can take the layer of vaseline off my eyes.

Mariella Pizza
CONTENT
Despite living in the same apartment for a few years now, we still don't have a default delivery pizza we trust. We've tried Pete's-A-Place, Pizza Paradise, Two Boots To Go West, and Bravo Pizza. Having a trusted pizza place is essential, so we continue the good fight, and last night, another one bit the dust, Mariella Pizza Mariella Pizza (multiple locations but only one delivers to us). Half plain (the way I like to evaluate pizza) and half sausage (the way Lon likes to evaluate pizza) resulted in a mediocre review from Lon and a wailing complaint from me. (If you haven't noticed yet, I'm the pickier one.) The biggest problem is that the crust is so soggy, just wet and limp. Eww. The flavors are average. Large Pie (half plain, half sausage) is $18.50. Don't bother.

Coppola's East
CONTENT
On Sat night, 10 of us gathered to celebrate Monica's birthday (you may remember the cake I made) at Coppola's East Coppola's East. The restaurant doesn't warrant a detailed post. It's suffice to say that the food ranges from poor to mediocre. Monica, the birthday girl, complained about an over-dresssed salty salad, when she's not really one to complain about food. James, sitting next to me, had a dry Chilean Sea Bass that tasted more like frozen cod. My Short Rib Ragu over Pappardelle was really the best of the bunch, a safety dish you can't really mess up, yet it was still too oily, and the pasta that could have been good was mostly stuck together. Oddly, the portion sizes were inconsistent, some dishes looked like an average entree while some looked like a family style platter. The prices span quite a distance too, between $16-$32 for entrees (the prices on their website are not current) with no correlation to size of the dish. The staff was pretty good, and few places can seat groups of 10 or more these days, but it didn't seem like any one of us was ever going back.

Shrimp Ceviche of No Origin
CONTENT
Whenever I hear about ceviches, people are always talking about the ceviches of their homeland, Argentina, Peru, Chile. Everyone will proudly back-up theirs as the best. With the ingredients I had, like lime, cilantro, red onion, etc, I naturally thought of ceviche, but I also had some pomelo, and I just desperately wanted to include it. Since Pomelo is native to South East Asia, this is kind of a fusion dish.Shrimp Ceviche of No Origin1. Peel and clean the shrimp. Cut them in half lengthwise. Submerge shrimp in lime juice and store in the fridge for 3 hours.2. Stir in cucumber, red onion, cilantro, and hot sauce. Refrigerate for another 30 minutes.3. Put 1/4 cup of pomelo in each martini glass.4. Strain ceviche, season to taste, and divide among the 3 glasses.

Make Ahead Black Bean Soup
CONTENT
This black bean soup benefits from being made a day ahead so that the flavors can really come together. It's always great to have these kind of recipes around because sometimes you want to get some of the cooking out of the way early, so you don't have to rush day of.Make Ahead Black Bean Soup~6 servingsIngredientsInstructions1. In a 3 1/2 quart pot, heat sausage on medium heat, until fats come out. Add onions and stir until softened, 2-3 minutes.2. Stir in garlic and brown for a minute. Stir in tomato paste and brown for about 2 minutes. Add 2 cups of chicken broth and bring to a boil. Add beans and return to a boil again.3. Reduce to a simmer and cook until liquid evaporates, about 35 minutes. Add the remaining cup of chicken broth, stir and simmer for another 10 minutes. Remove from heat and cool.4. Store in the fridge overnight.5. When ready to serve, reserve 1 cup of the black beans, and heat the rest in a pot (2-3 quart capacity). Mix in 1/2 cup of water and blend with an immersion blender. Continue adding water as needed, 2 tablespoons at a time, until you get the consistency you want. Stir in the reserved black beans. Bring to a boil, season (may be salty enough already) and serve with tortilla chips.

Banana Birthday Cake with Cream Cheese Frosting
CONTENT
It's my friend Monica's birthday and of course I made a cake. I went through the massive list of recipes I have bookmarked and decided on a banana cake. I made a few changes: I omitted the nuts (Monica doesn't like nuts), opted for a cream cheese frosting, and threw in some chocolate shavings for decoration.Banana Birthday Cake-adapted from this recipeCream Cheese FrostingInstructions-1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (325 degrees F with convection). Spray 3 (9″ round) pans with non-stick spray. Set aside.2. Cream sugar and butter together with paddle attachment on mixer. Add eggs one at a time, beating well between each egg. Add bananas, sour cream, and vanilla, mixing just till combined. Don't worry about lumps.3. In a separate bowl, combine flour, baking soda, and salt.4. Fold dry ingredients into wet batter, just until combined. Do not over mix.5. Pour into prepared pans and bake for 30 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then remove to a cooling rack and cool completely before frosting.6. To make frosting, use the paddle attachment to combine butter and cream cheese at medium speed until fluffy, about 5 minutes. Reduce speed to low and add confectioner's sugar gradually.Notes on assembling and decorating:While this cake is moist, the edges are crispy, so I decided to cut the edges off.

Avomergency - Ay Caramba!
CONTENT
In celebration of our new multi-lingual site, we had a little fiesta yesterday at Casa de FoodMayhem. Actually, the real reason was because we bought a bunch of avocados at BJ's last weekend and they were turning ripe very quickly. We were hoping to make it to the weekend to have some friends over, but the avocados made other plans. It was an Avomergency!Fortunately, Justin, Sophia, Stephen, and Tim swooped in at the last minute to save us from eating lots of guacamole. And really I mean save me since Jessica doesn't care much for avocados.The plan was to make several different guacamole recipes to see which was best. I copied the format of Tyler Florence's old show \"The Ultimate\". I made two recipes that are highly rated at the California Avocado Commission web site (Avocado.org), within their Guacamole Central area. I like how they have many recipes listed with ratings. Then I made a third recipe of my own. Oh yes, and I also had everyone rate all the different types.The first recipe I picked was the aptly named \"Guacamole Perfecto!\" It is one of the highest rated recipes on Avocado.org and as far as traditional guacs go, it won hands down in our tasting! What was most interesting about the recipe is that there is nothing particularly distinctive about the recipe (except the inclusion of White Pepper), but it really tastes natural and wonderful. Tim suggested it was a \"Good party guac., very typical\" and Sophia gave it a smiley face.The second recipe I picked was rated highly as well and called \"Argentinean Guacamole\". It was selected more for the distinctiveness of the ingredients, rather than the rating.It basically uses the flavoring of paella rather than traditional guacamole, that is: saffron, thyme, lemon, white onion, and parsley. This dish came out gorgeous, with hints of yellow and red from the saffron peppered throughout the lovely green. However, the overwhelming consensus was that this guac kind of tastes like dirt. Weird, huh? First of all, it actually tastes like fatty paella. We love paella, but it is bizarre in the form of mashed avocado. Secondly, the floral and earthy tones, do not combine well with avocado and raw white onion. And finally, this left horrible tastes in our mouths. Sorry if this is gross, but when I burped later that night, all I tasted was this guac (and that's after eating tons of other things). Justin commented \"I don't get it\" and Jessica said \"Agh!\"The final recipe was my own recipe -- a new one, made for this tasting. I call it \"Roasted Guacamole\". We all agreed that it was delicious with natural sweetness from the roasting and heat from the peppers. In the end, we also agreed that while it has mashed avocado in it, it does not provide the traditional flavors of guacamole, and would be delicious in another dish. So, I recommend you try this, and perhaps roll it into your next burrito. Stephen commented that it has \"Tricky heat\" and Tim noted that it was \"Very tasty with a good aftertaste and zing.\"Roasted GuacamoleIngredients1 Sweet Yellow OnionInstructions

That sounds delicious but the name of your recipe is off.  I get that the spices you use would make it a turkish meatball but as Turkey is predominantly a muslim country and pork is a forbidden meat, calling something turkish with bacon in it just seems wrong...same if it would have been a jewish burger.

On Fat
CONTENT
Lots of people ask us about what's in our pantry. Well today's talk is about fat! I believe it was Marcos who said, \"You're not fat, you're just too short for your weight.\" Excellent.We use many different fats here at FoodMayhem to rock our dishes' worlds. The selection is quite variable based on parameters including temperature, cooking method, and, of course, flavor. Another consideration is how well the fat conveys heat to the other ingredients. Each type of fat has so many varied properties to consider.I've listed below the items we commonly use, and to some extent, in the order we most frequently use them (most frequent first). In the case where specific type or brand matters to us, I've included it. For instance, we only cook with Large Eggs (because by default all baking recipes call for large eggs). And in the case of mayo, I've noted Hellman's, because they are hands down the winner for flavor and consistency.If you examine the photo carefully, you'll notice there are various items included not noted above. That's because we alter our oils from time-to-time or keep them in easier to use containers than the ones we buy them in. For instance, we buy vegetable oil in the one gallon jug, but then transfer some into a mister bottle (we're moving away from using aerosol cooking sprays, like Pam). We also made some into Chili Oil.Also, I've included bacon and salt pork, which are on the list, since we will typically render out the fat and cook in it, such as with the recent scallop dish we did. And sadly, we would love to more frequently use lard, but we just don't generally keep it around the house, so we usually substitute either vegetable shortening or the rendered pork fat.I've attempted to list the oils in a grid below, based on properties that we keep in mind when making cooking decisions. Obviously, we don't reference a grid like this every time we cook, but we keep these things in mind. Here are the definitions:Hope this helps your cooking! Download the grid as a spreadsheet.

CONTENT
When we were in Corfu, Greece we had fabulous Spinach Pie Rolls. I found something similar with a cheese filling in NY, but it wasn't as good without the spinach. I do love cheese so combining the two, I now have my own version of the Spinach Pie Roll.Spinach Pie RollsInstructions-1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (325 degrees F with convection). Cover a cookie sheet with wax paper.2. Heat olive oil in a large saute pan on medium heat. Add onions and stir around for a minute. Add scallions and garlic, stirring for another minute. Add parsley and frozen spinach and stir until there are no frozen pieces and it is all evenly heated. It should be dry. Remove from heat and allow to cool.2. In a large bowl mix together ricotta, feta, and spinach mixture. Season to taste.3. When you work with phyllo, you have to work quickly. Always cover any sheets you are not using with a wet paper towel. Lay one sheet down, brush with olive oil. Lay another sheet on top, brush with olive oil again. Repeat until you have a total of 4 sheet, without olive oil on the top layer.4. Form a log of spinach and cheese mixture along the length of the phyllo, a little bigger than 1″ in diameter.5. Roll it up. When you get to the end, brush a strip of olive oil to seal it.6. The hard part is now rolling it like a cinnamon bun because it cracks pretty easily. I find it best to start curving it and finding which side like to curl more. The inside needs to bend more than the outside of the curl. (If it does crack, you can patch it up by making something like a phyllo band-aid. It's just like the 4 layers you made before but cut it in strips to use as bandages.)7. Repeat steps 3 through 6 until you have 7 rolls. Place them on the cookie sheet with wax paper. Bake for 18 minutes or until golden.

Doughnut Plant
CONTENT
A few nights ago, my brother brought over 10 doughnuts from Doughnut Plant Doughnut Plant. Good heavens! They were so good. Between the 5 of us, we all had different favorites, but I could really eat any and all of them. To be picky (yes, I have to be) the one complaint I have is that the pistachio one tastes more like almond extract. Lon loved the Creme Brulee doughnut, with a pastry cream center and lightly crunchy sugar coating.

Sushi Yasuda #27
CONTENT
Sure we've been to Sushi Yasuda once or twice before, but it just keeps staying awesome. Last night we had yet another new type of fish: Buri.It's a type of yellowtail that has a texture, similar to swordfish, firm and meaty. However, it's fattier. It was wonderful.In order to contrast the Buri with other types of yellowtail, I ordered several other varieties to do a mini-sampling. If memory serves me (anyone get this reference?), from left-to-right, these are: Shimaaji, Hiramasa, Warasa, Buri.Keep it real Sushi Yasuda!

Payard Pisses Me Off
CONTENT
Back when I was in culinary school, I was told that celebrity chefs put out cookbooks with recipes that weren't tested, and sometimes not even written by that big name chef. Hearing that really disappointed me but I had never experience a problem first hand, until now.A couple of weekends ago, I decided to make an Apple Cake recipe from Simply Sensational Desserts by Francois Payard. It was well, just ok. I decided it was a fluke or maybe just personal preference and tried another recipe last night. I spent my whole evening making Chocolate-Raspberry Cake and the result in the end REALLY REALLY pissed me off.Throughout the entire process, I kept thinking, this is so poorly written. Approximate time for things didn't even come close. The genoise was supposed to \"bake for 30-45 minutes, until the cake has pulled away from the sides of the pan\". The cake never pulled away from the sides and wasn't done until 45 minutes. Just to be clear, I have an oven thermometer, I measure by weight (more accurate), and I've done a whole lot of baking. The whipped ganache portion is made with too much butter. I thought the proportions looked weird but went with it. It ends up being too much butter and looks spotted with bits of butter. Also the picture of the cake is shown with a non-whipped ganache as the outside coating, which is not in the recipe. Lastly, the cake is given 20 minutes to chill and supposed to be served room temperature. At this point, I looked at the cake in disgust and knew I wasn't going to serve it so I slice a piece for Lon to try to see if he would even eat it. It doesn't even slice without pushing all the filling out. So it looks bad and it tastes disgustingly sweet (and I didn't even use all the raspberry syrup) even for Lon, so no I cannot serve this to guests tomorrow.So, I'm really ticked off now. I have guests coming and no dessert yet. I used up good expensive chocolate on this cake that will go in the garbage.

My mom took us to try Guang Zhou Restaurant Guang Zhou Restaurant, a pretty new place, for their Dim Sum. Most notable is their translucent dumpling skins. No matter which one we tried, we marveled over how perfectly bouncy yet delicate they were, certainly the best we've ever had. The Crystal Shrimp dumplings were just a tad salty but still good.

Starting with the cold appetizers, the Marinated Cucumbers was the only dish out of six that I really enjoyed. They were fresh and crunchy, lightly pickled with just a hint of spice. The Cold Sliced Beef was dry and flavorless.The Duck Soup was much better though, simple and comforting. There was plenty of Chinese cabbage and mung bean thread, but it there wasn't enough tofu for each person to get a piece.The Fish was over-cooked.

Marzipan Rose
CONTENT
My grandmother is just about the most awesome 92 year old around. I can say that because (a) she is really awesome; and (b) not that many people live to their 90s, let alone stay so active. So to celebrate her 92nd year of awesomeness, Jessica and I made her a Rose cake (since her name is Rose). Actually, Jessica made the cake and then I snuck in at the last second to just help decorate.Jessica assembled one of the most delicious cakes I've had in a long time. It's called a White Velvet cake and the recipe is from The Cake Bible. The filling and frosting are Raspberry Butter Cream and taste exceptional.After frosting the cake, she added a light hash pattern.We bought some marzipan from the baking supply store, along with some high quality food coloring. We are anti-food coloring, however, there is no getting around using it for some baking, without jumping through lots of hoops. So we limit it to just minor decorating, that can easily be avoided while eating.I rolled some of the marzipan with a few drops of the \"Super Red\" and thoroughly mixed it to get a nice even, bright red. I rolled a smaller knob of the marzipan with a few drops of the \"Forest Green\" and mixed it enough to get a good marbled effect. I wanted the leaves to look variegated.To create leaves I rolled the red into a log and sliced it into eight pieces. Then I laid a folded kitchen towel on the cutting board, then I put some plastic wrap, a piece of the marzipan, and then more plastic wrap. I pressed and rubbed the marzipan through the plastic wrap with the back of a spoon until I got a great petal shape.I rolled one of the petals tightly to form the center of the rose bud. Then I wrapped petal by petal around the center. Finally, I pinched and twisted the bottom of the bud to pull the petals in. I used a knife to smooth the petals and pull them open a bit.The same process was used to make two leaves and a smaller rose bud. We sat them in the frosting.We rolled some of the left over green marzipan into a very thin column shape. Then formed a good size 'R' on the cake (for \"rose\").Everyone seemed to enjoy the cake. Sabrina and Justin both seemed to really enjoy the marzipan. And I loved the cake, I cleaned up lots of leftovers.If you get a chance to play with some marzipan, you should! It's like Play-doh!

White Clam Sauce over Fresh Pasta
CONTENT
After making fresh fettuccine the other night, from the No-Knead Pasta Dough, we made another batch, in the shape of linguine. After the two nights, we had some left-overs of both shapes. I decided to combine them in one of my favorite pasta sauces: White Clam Sauce.I didn't bother writing an exact recipe, but here's the gist:Ideally, there should be plenty of sauce in the plate. Serve with toasted, soft rolls to sop up the extra sauce. Yum! This is a winner and it's pretty healthy. If you want to make it slightly healthier, just leave out the dry sausage and only use one tablespoon of butter.

Kefi, a restaurant I do recommend, has moved to 505 Columbus Avenue (at 84th Street). Now that it's so much bigger, you won't feel as squished and they are now accepting credit cards. I've got my fingers crossed that they maintain the quality while prices stay the same.

CONTENT
We hope you enjoyed the goodies we got at Sur La Table...our next stop was Williams-Sonoma (thanks to Nick!)I had a tube pan once upon a time, but through moving a couple of times, I seem to have lost it.An oil mister has been on our shopping list for a while. Now we can spray the oil of our choice.

Gift Certificates Part 1: Sur La Table
CONTENT
We had held off using some of our wedding gift certificates because we thought we might move, but now that there's no telling what stores will close in this economy, we decided to whip them out and have a ball! First stop Sur La Table (thanks to Loren and Kim!)We already have measuring cups, spoons, and all, but you can never have enough. While your baking up a storm, it sucks to have to stop and wash dishes, so we needed some more. That mini measure that looks like a shot glass is great because it has markings for 1-6 teaspoons, up to 2 tablespoons in 1/2 increments, and ounce and milliliter options.

Hill Country
CONTENT
A while back, during an eventful night out, Jessica and friends tried to stop by Hill Country Hill Country, a barbecue joint in Flat Iron. However, they left due to high prices and long lines. Last night, I went back with Bill, Sal, & Steve, knowing we would have to face those issues.The setup is supposed to mimic an old school Texas restaurant where the food is picked up by patrons at various stations and where meat is sold by weight.Meat is handed over, wrapped in paper, on a plastic tray with cheap metal tableware. The meat ranges in price up to $22 per pound and can be purchased by the slice or rib. There is also a combo for $25.Sides are at a separate station (as are drinks and desserts). There are cold and hot sides, as well as breads, spreads, and miscellaneous (avocado, onions, etc.). They range in price up to $5.50, although you can buy larger amounts with quantity discount.The restaurant wasn't too busy, yet it was very loud and every step required waiting. The single upstairs bathroom (shared by men and women) had a line. The meat station had a long line. The sides station had a short line. All the while, someone has to hang out at the table, to ensure no one takes your table or personal belongings, especially concerning since tables are grabbed at will by patrons. This process is awkward and inconvenient for eating at the same time as friends.I tried to pick a good sampling: a single Beef Rib, two Pork Ribs, some Brisket Moist, some Beef Shoulder, a Jalapeno Cheese Kreuz Market Sausage, and Corn Bread. I also tasted the Mac & Cheese, and the Corn Pudding.Meat items include bread or crackers.Generally, the food is decent, especially in Manhattan, where BBQ is mediocre at best. The Brisket Moist was the most enjoyable, although so rich, I'm glad I only had two slices. The Pork Spare Ribs were pretty good as well, I enjoyed how they tasted of pure pig, but if there was a rub on it, which I'm told there was, it added little to the taste. The Beef Rib had nothing to offer, I'd pass on that if I were you.Sal and I agreed that the sausage didn't have much flavor at all, but left a good heat in our mouths from the jalapeno. Finally, the Beef Shoulder was just off tasting to me. There were three items on the table (in addition to paper towels): sweet barbecue sauce, which was just sugar with no other taste; hot sauce, which tasted like any cheap hot sauce (think: Frank's, but not as good); and salt & pepper.So the entrees were boring. The sides? About the same. Average corn bread. So-so Mac & Cheese. Nothing was bad, but nothing was good either.The pudding was served with Nilla Wafers both in the pudding and on the side... just as any good banana pudding should be served. It also had a good amount of fresh banana in it. The pudding is absolutely perfect. Period. The best I've had in Manhattan.The Pecan Pie was okay, but nothing special. Fortunately, they topped it with good vanilla ice cream.While the prices are a bit high, they're not outrageous, if you don't go overboard. My soda was $3 but served in a huge mason jar. The food was fine, but nothing special. There is not much service to speak of (they do check up on you for drink refills regularly). And the cheap tableware leaves a metallic taste in your mouth.If you want BBQ and you're in the area, walk a few blocks down and over to Wildwood. It's about the same price and similar style in the restaurant. But much better service, somewhat better food, and real plates and tableware. Plus NO LINES.

I LOVEEE the moist brisket..it's such a guilty pleasure. We usually go during lunch time so it's pretty empty. I'm not sure the prices are any different but there isn't a wait and it's empty enough to leave your stuff at the table without anyone trying to take your things. The sweet tea isn't anything like the south's but it's still pretty tasty. But like you said..it is pretty darn expensive....

Meyerboy - First of all, great name!  Second, yep, I've been to RUB, although I didn't review it on FoodMayhem.  The taste was less than average NYC BBQ, and they, similar to Hill Country, don't have plates.  However, they don't even have tableware!  The only upside to RUB, is the people there were super nice, and gave me and my friends tastes of everything before we ate, so we could choose.  However, since the taste was so-so I haven't gone back.

No Knead Pasta
CONTENT
I'm already mildly obsessed with No Knead Bread. Then came the Quicker No Knead Bread. Then I saw No Knead Pasta! Holy Cow! My prayers have been answered.This method uses a food processor to quickly bring egg and flour together (details in the lovely post by The Second Pancake) in just minutes, instead of the torture of kneading.It's easy enough to make for lunch. Seriously! I may be eating pasta for lunch every day from now on.

Broccoli Rabe with Calabrese Sausage
CONTENT
As a kid, I wasn't into bitter vegetables, but I now I adore radicchio, arugula, and of course broccoli rabe. I'm still not into bitter melon but perhaps when I'm old, haha. (Sorry mom!)I read in Lidia's Italian-American Kitchen, that she peels the stem of her broccoli rabe. I had never done that before, usually just chopping off the rough ends. It ends up being worth the effort to get these tender stems. Now I love broccoli rabe even more!Broccoli Rabe with Calabrese Sausage1. Heat olive oil in a 11″ wide 2 1/2″ high pan (that has a lid) on medium high heat. Add garlic and red pepper and brown lightly.2. Add broccoli rabe, season lightly, and toss. Let the leaves wilt until they are below the rim. Sprinkle calabrese on and cover. Turn flame down to low and cook until stems are tender, about 3-5 minutes.3. Toss and adjust seasoning. Serve.

If you like broccoli rabe stem. You may also want to try broccoli stem. (the big chunky stem!) As a kid, my mother would let me peeled it with a table knife(it is fun for kids), and then cut them into thin slices to cook with the florets. Personally, I enjoyed it the most when they are pickled simply with sugar and rice vinegar.

Blueberry Banana Smoothie
CONTENT
Lon's a lactard (lactose intolerant) and he doesn't love soy bean milk so we gave almond milk a try. It turned out to be quite good. In cereal, it's similar to a lightly flavored skim milk, and even better, it's healthier. We buy the Blue Diamond brand and it's only 60 calories per serving (8 oz) for the original and 90 calories per serving for the vanilla.So, I wanted to try almond milk in more applications, and the first experiment turned out well. This Blueberry Banana Smoothie doesn't taste like the dairy version but it's thick like any good smoothie, yet feels lighter.Blueberry Banana SmoothieJust put everything in a blender and blend until smooth, about 5 good pulses. Enjoy!

Ramen Setagaya
CONTENT
A hot bowl of noodle soup is the winter cure, so it's definitely time to test out the ramen places, as I said I would. So far, my search has been rather disappointing, with places like Ajisen Ramen, Menchanko-tei, and Men Kui Tei. The only place we actually like is Ippudo but the line is really too long there to ever go during dinner time.So last night, I checked out Ramen Setagaya Ramen Setagaya with Rachel, Brandon, and Olivia. I tried the Shio Ramen, their salt broth ramen, and it was satisfying. The noodles had a nice bounce, the broth was flavorful, and I enjoyed the tender salt egg and marinated bamboo as well. As much as I like pork belly, this is not the best way to use it. The meat becomes chewy and the fat seems like blobs in the way, but it probably helps to flavor the soup so I would't want it removed.

Scallion Cream Cheese
CONTENT
Since we've been watching House lately, I was thinking about the phrase \"delivery mechanism\". It is used in reference to methods used to deliver drugs into the needy recipient. Around these parts the drug is homemade lox, the needy recipients are our mouths, and the delivery mechanisms vary.Today the delivery mechanism was a bagel smeared with homemade Scallion Cream Cheese. Normally, I don't care for scallion cream cheese or any cream cheese for that matter. But, once you make it at home, it's a whole different story.This is one of the simplest recipes I've ever written, so you should absolutely try it, it's worth it.IngredientsInstructionsWhile you're probably asking yourself \"what's so special about this?\" or perhaps noting that it looks like any other scallion cream cheese, we can tell you it taste so much better fresh! You'll just have to try it to believe.

Oh I believe you. I've never made my own scallion cream cheese, but I have made carmelized onion cream cheese-perfect with lox. I'm trying your method, but one question: is it absolutely necessary to salt the scallion? What does it add to the prep?
Lon
2009-01-19 16:23:00
EMC - Honestly, I haven't tried it without salting.  However, my logic was that I wanted to get rid of most of the moisture from the scallions, otherwise the water will come out in the cream cheese and it will separate. Also, there should be some salt in the final product.  Finally, salt will help preserve the whole thing.

I bet it would also be great with whipped cream cheese (of which I'm a big fan of lately, since it's much easier to spread on than regular cream cheese, and it's lighter calorie-wise due to its fluffiness).

By the way, I've been making this recently and I've never bothered with trying to get the moisture out of the scallions first—I just add everything in at once, and the final product never seems too watery at all. The salt does still need to be there for flavor, though.

My mom has been making a scallion cream cheese similar to this for as long as I can remember. She always added some sour cream to soften up the cream cheese a bit, and then she added a bunch of paprika to give it a nice pink color. We have always had it as a topping for motzah, but I'm sure it would be great on bagels too.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (325 degrees F with convection). Butter and flour a 9″ bundt pan.2. In a small bowl, combine brown sugar, pecans, and cinnamon. Set aside.3. In a large bowl, cream together butter and sugar. Beat in eggs, one at a time. Stir in sour cream, vanilla extract, and almond extract. In a medium sized bowl, combine flour, baking powder, and salt. Stir dry ingredients into the wet batter, just until combined. Fold in blueberries.4. Pour half of the batter into the prepared pan. Sprinkle half of the brown sugar/nut mixture onto the batter. Cover with remaining batter and sprinkle the rest of the brown sugar/nut mixture on top.5. Bake for 55 minutes or until toothpick comes out clean.

I actually love eating frozen blueberries.  Normally, I hate when people call fruit dessert, b/c it just doesn't fill that niche for me, but frozen blueberries feel a little more decadent than fresh fruit and can sometimes satisfy a dessert craving (and be healthy at the same time).

Deli-Style Turkey Burgers
CONTENT
There is a crappy little deli on 5th avenue near 23rd Street called Deli Marche, I used to eat there fairly regularly. One of my favorite sandwiches was the turkey burger. They're low quality, but taste so good. Tonight, since we had some ground turkey meat around, I decided to try and reproduce it. I did a pretty good job (so I say)...Ingredients~4 mini burgers (or 2 regular burgers)InstructionsTo make the burgers a bit fancier, I served them on some crusty bread. And on the side I made Whipped Celeriac & Red Cranberry Potatoes. To make the side dish, boil large cubes of red cranberry potatoes with small dice of celeriac for about 15 minutes, until all pieces are fork tender. Use much less celeriac than potato (it's strong). Strain the vegetables, then in the same sauce pot, warm whole milk, butter, lots of kosher salt, and black pepper. Return the veggies, and mash each cube once (don't over work!). Then quickly whisk, about 30 seconds until lighter and no liquid remains. Taste for seasoning.This is a pretty fast and easy meal with complex tastes and a really satisfying, comfort food feeling. Yum!

You might remember that we brought back several bottles of olive oil from our honeymoon and we promised to report on each one.Here's the last one, Gaea Kalamata D.O.P. Olive Oil. It comes in a cool cylindrical tube that makes it easy to pack. Coincidentally, my mom brought us the same bottle of oil back from Greece when she went in September. It's good but not as good some of the other ones (will mention later).

A little more than a week ago, I made a Roasted Garlic and Sun Dried Tomato Dressing, and I kind of got hooked on the flavor, craving it again. I wanted to show you just how versatile it is so I didn't make the same salads. For the dinner with Sarah and Tim last night, I made an orzo salad.Pear Feta Orzo SaladInstructions -In a medium sized bowl, toss together orzo, pear, and dressing. Season to taste but go light on the salt because feta will add saltiness as well. Top with feta and serve.Sun Dried Tomato String BeansIf you noticed that I only used 3 tablespoons of the dressing, good catch! This evening, I needed a veggie side dish so I just sauteed some green beans with the left over dressing and it was great.

Wow! Your orzo salad recipe sounds so delicious! I was looking for some creative orzo recipes online and yours is definitely one I can't wait to try! I've really been wanting to try whole wheat orzo. Do you find the taste much different than non whole wheat? I'm a big fan of fruit in salads and adding pears is a great idea! I think even some strawberries or cranberries would add some tasty sweetness to the dish. I love feta cheese, especially in pasta. Is there a certain brand of feta you recommend? Thanks for providing the recipe for your roasted garlic and sun dried tomato dressing-sounds great! I recently created a very simple orzo and shrimp salad recipe. You can check it out on my blog. Thanks so much!

Hi Emily, whole wheat orzo is pretty close to regular. There is a difference but I feel like it's less noticeable than in other pastas. I've served it to guests many times and no one seems to mind and many do not even notice. For feta, I like Dodoni brand.Thanks for visiting and I'll definitely be checking out your shrimp recipe!

Broiled Salmon Skin & Dinner
CONTENT
We have been enjoying the sweet, salty goodness of the Homemade Lox all week. Last night, we had dinner with Sarah and Tim. While shaving off the last few pieces of pink goodness from one section of the lox, all that was left was the skin and a bit of meat around the edges. It was time to make Broiled Salmon Skin.To make it, I simply applied a bit of kosher salt and placed it skin-side-up on an aluminum foil covered baking sheet. Into the broiler it went. I checked it every two minutes for a total of six minutes. At the four minute point, it had some large air bubbles that were unsightly, but the rest of the skin was still not crisp. My guess is that the portions of the skin with less meat expanded faster.When it was done, I sliced it into rectangles about 1×3 inch pieces and seasoned it all with tellicherry black pepper. They were incredibly delicious!Jessica also whipped up a quick, delicious tapas dish of Chili Garlic Shrimp. She sauteed some plump shrimp in the Chili Oil we made with garlic. Then seasoned with salt and pepper.Also on the table were lots of other homemade items including Turkey Meatballs Puttanesca, No-Knead Bread, an Orzo Salad (recipe coming soon), and the Lox. We served the lox, salmon skin, along with some Calabrese salami (from Keith) on the beautiful board we picked up in Chicago. There were other goodies as well, but they were purchased; such as Camember, Humboldt Fog, Greek Extra Virgin Olive Oil, and more.We ate everything in many combinations. The salmon skin was delicious alone, with shrimp, with chili oil, and various other ways. It was quick and delicious... since we happened to have salmon skin handy.

I made the Chocolate Cappuccino Cheesecake Squares from Great Cookies by Carole Walter. I'm sorry I've been making stuff out of cookbooks lately (and can't post those recipes) but this wasn't the most fabulous recipes anyway (it was too much crust, not enough cheesecake). I really just want to show you the way I decorated it (which was not part of the recipe). You can use this idea for any chocolate cheesecake recipe, bar or cake.Use any recipe for sour cream topping (for cheesecake) and put it in a squeeze bottle. Underbake the cheesecake 10 minutes and pipe a design of swirl, curls, and dots. Bake for the remaining 10 minutes.

Turkey Meatball Puttanesca
CONTENT
Some people love olives, popping them whole, one after the other. They're too strong for me to eat alone, but I do like the way they flavor sauces. Puttanesca is the perfect example. I had my heart set on making it when I realized I didn't have any anchovies, so it turned into a Turkey Meatball Puttanesca. The result is a perfect winter comfort food, without being heavy and fattening. It's actually incredibly healthy and you'll be surprised how tender lean turkey can be.This is one of those dishes you make in large batches because it reheats so well, and if you're serving to company, it's actually best the next day.Turkey Meatball Puttanesca~12-14 servingsmeatballssauce1. In a large mixing bowl, combine the ingredients for the meatballs. Form into balls about 1″ or a little smaller. Makes roughly 109 little meatballs. Set aside.2. (You have to make the meatballs in two batches.) In a large pot (preferably a dutch oven like LeCreuset), heat 2 teaspoons of olive oil and half of the red pepper over medium heat. Add half of the meatballs in a single layer in the pot and brown all sides lightly. Remove to a bowl.3. Heat the rest of the oil and red pepper. Add the rest of the meatballs and brown all sides again. Now add the rest of the meatballs back in the pot. Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, and garlic. Bring to a boil.4. Stir in olives and capers. Bring down to a simmer, cook covered for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove the lid and reduce for 5 more minutes. Serve with bread or over pasta.

L'artusi L'artusi, sister restaurant to the teeny Dell'anima, is the expanded version. The space is bigger (2 floors), the open kitchen/counter is longer, the menu, though similar, has more items. The first floor is still packed and noisy, but the second floor is more conversation friendly. Our party of 6 was lucky enough to get seated in the semi-private room (2nd floor), which is surrounded by windows, viewing the wine collection.We started with a bottle of Tralivio, which everyone seemed to really like. Angie liked the finish, while I was really intrigued by how it seemed to be almost salted (it's not actually salted), which really picked up the flavors.The hamachi looks like little bunches of flowers set on thinly sliced granny smith apples.The dinner was in honor of Angie's birthday so I made a Scarlet Empress cake. They charge a $2 plating charge, which we thought was reasonable (but not better than free), and also refrigerated the cake. Service was usually pretty good, although they needed a little reminding sometimes, but the overall experience seems worth the prices (crudo $12-$15, pastas $16-19, fish/meat $10-$28).

For Angie's birthday, I wanted to make something special, something a little more complex and work intensive. Note to self: I am out of practice with the fancy cakes.The Scarlet Empress, from The Cake Bible (by Rose Levy Beranbaum), was tougher than I thought it would be. The gist is that you make a tight jelly roll (and circular bottom with same cake), slice it up and line a bowl with it. Make a Vanilla Bavarian (my friend Zoe brought me fresh vanilla bean from Madagascar!) and fill the cake/bowl with it, place circular bottom on top, cover and chill. When it sets, you un-mold it upside down and ta-da!Happy Birthday Angie!

Winter Restaurant Week 2009
CONTENT
Restaurant Week is starting this Sunday, January 18th, so I've been getting emails asking where I am going, etc.I gotta break it to you, I'm not a fan of restaurant week, at least any more. Years ago, I thought it was a pretty good deal and a good way to sample a bit from top/expensive restaurants you might not otherwise get a chance to enjoy. Nowadays, restaurants have a \"special\" restaurant week menu of mass produced stuff that they don't usually serve in their restaurants. It seems to always start with a soup or salad, a choice between a salmon dish or a chicken dish (usually white meat, bleh) as the entree, and the dessert is molten chocolate cake or ice cream/sorbet. Good luck with substitutions.If you never dine at anything but pizzerias and delis, this may be a step up for you, but if you're not new to restaurants completely, you're really not getting a great deal. You may be getting more in quantity, but that does not recover poor quality in my eyes. Now that dinner (for restaurant week) is $35, my preference is to not get the cheap appetizer and uninteresting dessert, save the $35 and go to the restaurant (not during restaurant week) and get two or three appetizers off their regular menu or 1 entree, and that will really be experiencing that restaurant's chefs. From the way restaurant week tastes, I think that's when all the usual chefs, sous chefs, etc. go on vacation.For the first time, restaurant week is now including Sundays, possibly because restaurants are really suffering. It looks like a humongous list of participants too. I am sensitive to that, and I do want to support restaurants and hope that most will not go out of business because of the economy. So my advice is, go for lunch. I had a pretty good lunch at Union Square Cafe during restaurant week, last year, and I'd go again. It seems that restaurants are willing to work with their normal level of quality for $24.07 for lunch but not for $35 during dinner, and many of the top restaurants don't participate in the dinner offer anyway.The weirdest thing is that some restaurants are cheap enough that $35 would actually be the same thing you'd pay there for 3 courses anyway, so why bother with restaurant week? Go when you can pick off the whole menu.Despite all this, restaurant week has grown in popularity every year and that just makes me sad. Don't be duped!

Last RW was probably the first time I managed to get out unscathed.  I totally agree about the going when it's not RW and managing a nicer meal.

We love watching Cook's Illustrated's show America's Test Kitchen. Their tips are almost always dead-on accurate and their recipes are simple and work. That's why when I reproduced their recent recipe for French Chicken in a Pot, I was disappointed that it resulted in an over-cooked chicken. Following their cooking time by weight, it suggested checking the chicken at 80 minutes, at which point the bird was way over-done. There was plenty of fond and juice to make a jus, but the bird itself was dry. We ate it anyway, but weren't happy. This was the first time I had over-cooked a chicken in years, usually I undercookAnyway, their technique for jus works wonderfully. We also added two other aspects to the recipe. First, after separating the fat and chicken juices, we poured some of the chicken fat into Baby Chinese Broccoli along with garlic to make a veggie side. We also took the garlic pieces from the pot and mashed them into the jus, yum! Finally, after removing the rosemary and bay leaves from the pot, we added some pre-cooked cous cous, and sauteed it in the remaining fond and veggies and had a wonderful carb. Actually, the cous cous was the best part of the meal!So, in the end, the flavors are great, and there are lots of ideas for what you can do with this meal, but be careful with your chicken if you follow the recipe.

I made this 3 times by now, the first two were right on - amazingly tender chicken, with around 100 minutes cooking time. The third one (which I made 2 days ago) I cooked for 80 minutes, but it turned out undercooked and tougher than the first two. I think this could be due to either (1) the chicken itself - this one was from Trader Joe's, whereas the first two were from either WF or Sam's club, or (2) because I added paprika to the rub and didn't have any garlic on hand. (I used both a LeCreuset pot and a "generic" with about the same success, so I know it's not the pot!)So I'd say give it another try with 80 minutes, maybe with a different chicken brand. Or maybe it's something with your oven temp (although sounds like you would have noticed by now :)?I do love your veggie and couscous ideas   Maybe I'll use the left-over au jus tonight to cook some veggies.

MK, our chicken was from BJ's, which I think is like the Costco's chicken. We used a LeCreuset pot and we have an oven thermometer (which I always watch closely).I don't think your paprika will make a difference, but it seems like a weak recipe if it only works some of the time.

Yams vs. Sweet Potatoes
CONTENT
What's the difference between yams and sweet potatoes?This has always been so confusing, partially because I trust the signs at supermarkets. Lesson 1, don't do that. When you see a sign for \"yam\" in an American supermarket, it's likely wrong. Often, what we call \"yams\" in the US, is an orange colored variety of sweet potato. So, it's not a yam, got that? This reminds me of when my little cousin used to run around saying \"I am what I am but I am not a yam.\" Say that three times fast...heheSo, then I went around thinking, everything we see here is a sweet potato. The problem is that I frequent Asian supermarkets, and yup, they actually have real yams there. Now, I get more confused.So I was about to do a bunch of research to finally learn the difference once and for all (and write up a post for y'all), but why do that when I just found another blog that already wrote it up and did a damn good job of it.For the difference between yams and sweet potatoes, check out Zoe Bakes here.

Beef and Spinach Lasagna
CONTENT
Lasagna is the ultimate comfort food and it's probably one of the first things I learned to make. My mom (a fabulous Chinese cook) and I just followed the instructions on the side of a box of dry lasagna sheets, using jarred sauce. These days, I always make my own sauce, and after several variations, I have to dub this one my favorite, Beef and Spinach Lasagna. This is still a fairly classic tasting lasagna. It's just that I like mixing spinach into the cheese mixture. Isn't it wonderful when the healthier twist tastes better?Beef and Spinach LasagnaMeat SauceCheese & Spinach FillingAssembly*note: the lasgana sheets I used are made for 8×8 pan but I wanted to make more so I made a 9×13. It worked fine though.Instructions -Meat Sauce (can be made a day or two ahead and refrigerated, warm before using):1. Heat oil in a medium pot on medium high heat. Stir in onions and soften for about a minute. Add carrots and stir around for another minute. Stir in tomato paste until well distributed.2. Add ground beef and stir around until browned, about 5 minutes.3. Add crushed tomatoes, garlic, and bay leaf. Bring to boil. Stir and reduce heat to a simmer. Cover and cook for 40 minutes, stirring occasionally.4. Remove from heat and remove bay leaf. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F while meat sauce cools a bit.Cheese & Spinach Filling:1. Ring out spinach with paper towels.2. In a medium sized bowl , combine spinach, 8 ounces of mozzarella, and ricotta.Assembly1. Spread 1 cup of meat sauce on the bottom of the pan.2. Lay 4 sheets of lasagna down. See pic.3. Spread 1/3 of cheese and spinach filling on top of lasagna sheets. Spread a little more than 1 cup of meat sauce on top.4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 two more times. Lay another layer of lasagna sheets on top. Cover with remaining meat sauce. Spread remaining mozzarella on top.5. Cover with aluminum foil and bake for 40 minutes. Remove aluminum foil and bake for another 5 minutes. Serve.

Omonia Cafe
CONTENT
After dinner at Zenon Taverna, we were physically full, but not mentally full. Dessert could be the perfect remedy. Sarah, who used to live in Astoria, nominated Omonia Cafe Omonia Cafe, the perfect location since it was right by the train station.There's a bakery case on one side displaying all the beautiful desserts, where they sell stuff to-go, and a large seating area on the other side, bigger than most Manhattan restaurants. It's pretty dim, with lights (that change colors), which gives a half lounge half club feel, in a cheesy way. The selection is immense, covering cakes, pastries, crepes, and Greek specialties, and we wanted to dabble in all of it.I had my eye on the Mousse Cake just because it looked so good and I could see the chunks of strawberry in it. It turned out not to be what you'd expect of mousse cake. The \"mousse\" was like densely pressed whipped cream, only a hint of chocolate flavor, with the strawberry chunks. It was quite good, especially because it was only mildly sweet.The Tiramisu (Lon's favorite) was also good but not the classic version. We couldn't detect any mascarpone and the espresso flavor was light as well. The liquid it was sitting in was too sweet but the rest was just right.

I prefer sponge based cakes to mousse ones. Kainaz loves the latter. And the photo seems very tempting. The second Greek dessert likes a Turkish one too. There desserts are a bit too sweet for my tastes. I am never too full for desserts. I think I have a hump to store desserts like camels

You might remember the big jar of Pickled Mustard Greens I made. One of the best reasons to make it, is this dish, Squid with Pickled Mustard Greens. It's a traditional dish I grew up with and have always loved. You'll find it on menus as a lunch special over rice, but it might be an acquired taste (Lon did not like it).Squid with Pickled Mustard GreensInstructions -1. Boil a pot of water with a dash of salt. Blanch the squid for 5 seconds and drain. In a medium bowl, toss the squid with cornstarch.2. Heat oil in a wok and swirl around. Add squid and ginger and stir for a few seconds. Add mustard greens, garlic black bean sauce, and sugar. Stir around until it looks saucy, about a minute. Serve over rice.

A while back we sampled some delicious Blueberry Popcorn from Trader Joes. However, they don't seem to sell it any more. The result: I made our own. For this recipe, I started with corn kernels, but you could just as easily substitute any other popcorn, you'll need about 5 quarts.I adapted this recipe from one of the top-rated Caramel Popcorn recipes on AllRecipes.

We were excited for our big Greek feast at Zenon Taverna Zenon Taverna, after hearing about the Mezedes (meals) they offer. The Cyprus (or meat) Meze is $18.95 per person and the Fish Meze is $21.95 per person. We went with Sarah and Tim, so we got both (two of us Cyprus, two of us Fish) in order to try it all.A ton of cold appetizers flood the table. The Scordalia, Potato Salad, Seafood Salad, Octopus Salad, Beet Salad, Tzaziki, and Melitzanosalada were all overly acidic. The Cyprus salad had these interesting caper leaves in them which I liked until Sarah found thorns on them. The Tahini is standard, the Tarama looked barely touched, but we polished off the whole bread basket.The Fried Cyprus Meatballs (pork) were pretty good, tender and moist, very pork-y flavored.

Homemade Lox
CONTENT
Making lox at home is not really all that hard, all you need is salt, sugar, and pepper. Oh yes, and salmon, preferably super fresh salmon. Why would we think to make lox at home? Because we try to make everything at home, but also my mom does it...My mom has been making lox for years, she has tried various flavors, including curing it with tea. She buys special curing salt online, but I skipped that. I made two variants, one using basic ingredients anyone can find, and one a bit more special. Both are exceptional, better than just about any lox one can buy.It started last Friday when we were shopping in Flushing. We were walking around a Chinese supermarket that has a good fish section. I asked the fish monger if he had any whole salmon, and he took out a beautiful, 18-pound salmon, which he was willing to sell me for $4 per pound. While I would love it, we have no room in our kitchen for that size fish. So with the help of my mother-in-law (to do some translation into Chinese), I requested that he fillet and clean half and sell me that portion, it came out to just under six pounds and he charged $4.99 per pound.When we got the fish home, I used some clean needle nose pliers to pull each of the pin bones out. I also cleaned off any remaining scales and wiped the salmon as dry as possible with paper towels. The final step before rubbing was to slice the side into four roughly equal lengths.I made two rubs. The first was kosher salt, light brown sugar, and ground black pepper. The second was the same, but I replaced kosher salt with Applewood Smoked Salt.The magic ratio seems to be:Use that amount per pound of fish.The next step is to thoroughly, VERY THOROUGHLY, cover each piece of salmon in the rub. Really pack the stuff on. Try to get it built up on top and along each side. The texture is something like sand, so think of building a sand castle. You only need to get the rub on the flesh, don't worry at all about the skin side. If you get some on the skin, it's fine, but won't help much.I did two pieces of the basic rub and two pieces of the smoked. It is important to have two of each type you do, because the next step is to sandwich the pieces, flesh to flesh. When making the sandwich a lot of rub is going to fall off, try to minimize it. And after the sandwich is done, press more of the rub into the sides. Be generous!Wrap the sandwich in plastic wrap. Try to pull the wrap so the pieces are pressed tightly together. The trick is not pull the sides tightly closed. The salt and sugar are going to pull water out of the salmon and you want that to run off and out of the plastic.Most of the sites I've read about making lox recommend the technique my mom uses: just put the lox on a plate that is deep enough to hold the liquid. However, I'm not a fan of this approach, because I've seen first hand how it results in the fish sitting in the liquid. I tried something else. I used a steamer upside down in a Cambro box. Because it left space in the corners, I stuffed that loosely with aluminum foil. This worked really well! The foil helped support the weight of the fish and the steamer left plenty of space for liquid to run off.I packed in the fish sandwiches, the smoked one on the bottom, then the basic on top. My thinking was that the liquid run off from the basic would not contaminate the flavor of the smoked, but vice versa may not be as favorable. Plus, I rotated the packages 90 degrees, so the side opening wouldn't be in the same place. I hoped this would also help sharing of liquids.Notice how the salmon was a good inch over the rim of the box? By the time the lox was done, it was at least half an inch under the rim. When I put the whole thing in the fridge, I weight it with whatever was around in the fridge. Eventually, when it was below the rim, I found a plastic container cover that fit perfectly, then I weighted that down.Each day, I poured all the liquid out and flipped each of the sandwiches.After five days (today), it was time to clean the lox. When it came out of the sandwich, the rub was really packed into the flesh. It looked like gravlax.Then I headed to the sink to wash off the rub. I used a gentle flow of freezing cold water. It took quite a while, because I kept stopping when my hands went numb. Whatever I couldn't get off wit h the water, I worked on with paper towel. That worked well as it's important to dry the lox after rinsing it.The lox darkened dramatically and was tighter and smoother. It smelled wonderful!I sliced off a few slices as thin as possible using our sashimi knife. Ideally you should use the sharpest, longest, thinnest blade you have. A nice aspect of the yanagi-ba is that the blade is single edged.If at this point your lox is too salty, you can soak it in water for a few hours (or even up to a day), to reduce the salt level. You need to be careful though, as this can water log the lox and destroy the flavor. Fortunately, my lox came out perfect.I kept slicing super thin, perfect slices (I'm pretty darn good with a knife). Jessica and I kept eating.We agreed the two flavors were totally distinct and we loved both. It is exceptional lox.Not having any bagels on hand, I made my second favorite dish with lox: Lox and Eggs. I scrambled two eggs and laid a few slices on top, then seasoned with some Tellicherry Black Pepper. It was absolute heaven!So, now you know that making lox is not that hard. And at the value it's so worth it! This whole thing cost about $30 for almost 6 pounds of lox, that's about $5 per pound. Similar lox around here is $25 per pound. Try it and let us know!

Soopling -- Oh trust us, we don't mind being up to our ears in fish  nom nom nomGypsy -- Thank you!  All lox (AFAIK) is made either cured, smoked (usually cold-smoked), or a combination of the two.  Therefore, it's likely any lox you've had was made with sugar, it just wasn't obvious.  Pretty much all lox curing requires salt and sugar, other ingredients (like the black pepper we used) are optional.  Salmon has a natural sweetness, and the sugar enhances it, it doesn't make it particularly sweeter.  However, sugar is very good at pulling the water out, although not as good as salt (osmosis).  My guess is that if you tried to do it with just salt, it would taste too salty, so this is a good balance.  You could experiment with different ratios... If you do, let us know your findings!

Hi, That does look very good!  I do a slightly demistified version.  I skin the fillet and use it for (broiled) salmon skin sushi.  I use 1 or 2 pieces and freeze the rest.  I make it in a zip lock bag.  Without the skin its done in 2 days.  I have forgotten to pour the liquid out and it made no difference to taste or texture.  As good as the best lox I ever had.  Try lox hand roll with wasabi and avacado!  I think I'll make some today!

Eatingfoodboy - It's really not just seasoned salmon.  The salt and sugar draw the moisture out and preserve the fish, they don't add much in terms of flavor (other than concentrating the salmon's natural goodness).  Any other herbs or spices add flavor.BigEater - Good input!  These are good ideas all around.  Once nice thing about leaving the salmon skin on is that it helps in slicing the flesh super thing.  And you can also broil it, which I intend on doing, after slicing off the meat.  Good idea for sushi, I will do that as well

very cool and interesting post and a fish recipe...woo hoo.  I will try this. We always get Zabar's Nova Scotia Salmon which is very delicate and different from lox (and from Fairway's Nova).  I think the Nova must be cold smoked.  In any event, Zabar's Nova is super expensive...over $30 per pound.  Also, the front part of the salmon - the part closer to the head - is more desirable b/c it has slightly higher fat content relative to the tail area.
Lon
2009-01-10 21:34:00
Bill -- Yep, we love Zabar's Nova.  They have some other variants which are over $50 / lb.  nuts!  Nova is cold-smoked, if I had a smoker I'd totally make it.  The thing with nova that makes it more difficult, is not the cold-smoking, it's the brining.  The brining has to be very carefully balanced, or it will taste over-salted and it's not really fixable.

This is inspiring! Wanted to see if anyone has suggestions about the following:1. How long can this keep in the fridge, and has anyone tried freezing lox?2. If I use, let's say, 2lbs of salmon, should I shorten the curing time?
Lon
2009-01-11 16:34:00
MK - Store bought lox is good in the fridge for 6 days.  Freshly made lox can probably last a bit longer than that, particularly if you keep it in an airtight container, unsliced.  We expect it to last 2-3 weeks, and we're slicing up some at a time.If you make a 2 pound piece, it will still take 4-5 days to cure, it's more based on the thickness of the salmon, rather than the weight.  The thickness is fairly consistent as weight is altered by the length of the fillet cut.Let us know how yours comes out!

Lon

shiyuan - Did you smell, or better yet, taste the raw salmon before curing it?  My guess would be it wasn't fresh enough.  Alternatively, it could be it wasn't properly refrigerated while curing?
Copperhead

I started making a batch this afternoon.  I'm living in Japan, and the fresh salmon is common and cheap and very fresh.  I was able to get a fresh caught whole salmon for about $20 yesterday.It was amazing after putting the rub on the salmon and setting it aside for a few minutes how quickly it started drawing the liquid out of the salmon.I've got the fish in the fridge now, and I'm having a hard time waiting five days.

BigEater
2009-01-17 16:42:00
shiyuan, if raw fish has a nasty fishy smell do not taste it.  If it is fresh it should smell of the sea but not a strong fishy smell.  Another thing I think is important is that the scales should be removed from the skin.  A fishmonger will do it for you, a supermarket may sell it with the scales on.  That could be a cause of the problem.
shiyuan
2009-01-18 01:51:00
oh yeah - the fish still had scales on it. i didn't realize it would affect the taste of the fish. i tried to remove the scales myself but i didn't have much luck so i gave up and used it scales and all. thanks for the advice! i was not going to try lox again but now i think i will.

I just put my salmon in the fridge under the weight of a few bricks.  Your recipe, photos and instructions were so easy to follow.  I added 1/4 tsp of liquid smoke to the salt/sugar mixture to see how that imparts flavor.I'd be eager to read of other variations that you or others have tried.Dan
Lon
2009-03-02 07:44:00
Dan - That's a great idea.  Jessica and I were just talking about liquid smoke last night and we need to go buy some.  I'm sure that will provide a nice flavor, although honestly, 1/4 tsp sounds like a lot.  But let me know how it works out and if you think the intensity is the right level.Perhaps we'll post about other variations.  As I mentioned in the post, my mom has tried various teas, she has also added fruit flavors (blueberry was my favorite).  Other approaches include adding herbs, spices, and, of course, liquor.  Vodka is the classic, but most liquors would impart wonderful flavors.  We're also thinking about trying it with other fish, but if you try, we recommend sticking with fatty fishes, nothing too dry.

Nasty Fruits - Maybe
CONTENT
Remember last month when Olivia brought us a coconut? She also brought us two other fruits that she had bought in Florida. She told us to let them sit on the counter until they softened completely, then eat them. The darker one was supposed to be a potential replacement for chocolate, although when she tasted it, she said it tasted nothing like chocolate.So the yellow one is called Canistel (note the farm stand spelled it wrong), a.k.a. the \"Egg Fruit\". The green one is Black Sapote, a Persimmon relative. When they arrived they were both taut and shiney.So, we left the two fruit out on a plate and watched them closely. We regularly poked and prodded them and waited for them to soften.First, the bright green faded to dull green, almost like an avocado. But it was still pretty tough feeling.So, we waited longer. Eventually, the shape started to change and the sides collapsed inwards.Today, we figured it was time to open them up. I sliced open the Black Sapote first. It was really quite nasty looking. I'd describe it as a pile of poop. However, that didn't stop us. We dug in with spoons. Jessica put a teeny bit on a spoon and licked it. I had a bigger scoop, which I ran to the sink and spit out. It tasted like fermented fig pudding. We considered that maybe it sat out TOO long and spoiled.We split open the Canistel. It was much prettier inside, particularly the seed which looked like a beautiful mahogany nut. However, we spotted some blue in the top area. It turns out this one was spoiling, it seems we waited too long.Nevertheless, we tasted the bottom part. The consistency was much nicer than the Black Sapote. It tasted to me almost like a butternut squash soup that had cooled. However, it had clearly gone bad.We threw the rest out.We are so curious whether they taste good when they're not spoiled. How long were we supposed to wait? Has anyone else tried them?

I've only ever heard of the Black Sapote, which my mom raved about while on vacation in Mexico. It looked really gross to me too, but it was mashed up with sweetened condensed milk poured over it. My mom said it tasted like chocolate pudding. I was a little less adventure-some and opted not to taste what looked to me like....well, like you said, poop. I wonder if the fruit matured a little too long? One of the sources I read claims you should refrigerate it once ripened.

Dr. Food and Lesley, I think we did wait too long but the instructions my cousin got from where she bought it is to wait till the Sapote leaks liquid. That never happened so we eventually opened it. Unfortunately, we can't buy it here to try again. =(Tim, good idea! We will post on durian when it comes back in season.

Braised Lamb Shanks with Chickpeas and Dried Fruit
CONTENT
This dish is inspired by Moroccan flavors, which I love. The use of fruit brightens up the rich and heavy flavors of lamb. Although this dish does require some work, with so many ingredients, it is all very simple considering the restaurant quality meal you'll be able to present.Braised Lamb Shanks with Chickpeas and Dried Fruit~2 very large portionsInstructions-1. Mix first 6 ingredients in large bowl. Rub all over lamb shanks. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in medium sized dutch oven and brown the lamb shanks, about 8 minutes. Transfer lamb a plate.2. Add onion and tomato paste to drippings in skillet. Reduce heat to medium; sauté until onion is soft, about 5-7 minutes.3. Add broth, garbanzo beans, dried fruits, tomatoes, cinnamon sticks, ginger, and lemon peel and bring to boil, scraping up browned bits.4. Return lamb to skillet and bring to boil. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer, turning lamb occasionally until tender, about 2 hours.Uncover and simmer until sauce thickens, about 30 minutes. Season with salt and pepper if needed (I did not need to). Serve with cous cous and/or flatbread if desired.

Lon and I met up with Kasi for lunch at Obika Mozzarella Bar Obika Mozzarella Bar. It's in the atrium of the IBM building, which has a nice feel of almost al fresco dining, while being protected from the rain and cold. We made plans to meet for an early lunch at 11am just in case there was a lunch rush (never happened) but were soon disappointed hearing that their kitchen doesn't open till 11:30am. This is not anywhere on their website that we can find. It says they open at 9am.Well, I took this as a good opportunity to go to the bathroom, and good thing I had plenty of time...you have to hike into the Trump building and down an escalator, through the Trump Ice Cream Parlor, and into the back.If you're getting annoyed waiting for me to get to the food part, well, we had to wait, and so do you. Haha...JK We walked around and looked at their goodies; most things are on display.They were out of the mozzarella from Vermont for the tasting, so that was substituted with Straciatella, which ended up being the favorite for me and Kasi. It's just super soft mozzarella torn and sitting in cream, but so delicious.

Marinating Can Reduce Cancer Risk
CONTENT
We love to grill. We are also keenly aware of research tying grilling to increasing cancer risk. In my Treatise on Grilling, I mentioned how grilling can cause sugars and amino acids to convert into heterocyclic amines, which cause cancer. I also discussed how marinating can reduce these.New research from the University of Porto in Portugal, sent in by FoodMayhem friend Marcos, has more specifics about marinating. NewScientist summarizes it pretty well (full article here). The short gist is alcohol, specifically beer or wine, do the best job of retaining the sugars that otherwise convert to HCAs.

Blue-Pear-Y Crumb Pie
CONTENT
I've been working on this recipe for a while, trying several variations. The hard part (at least for me) was that pears give off a lot more water than apples. This is finally a version worthy of your eyes and taste buds. It's a simple fruit pie that can be made in winter months since it uses pears and dried blueberries.Blue-Pear-Y Crumb PieCrumb Topping1. Have the pie dough chilling in the fridge and preheat oven to 400 degrees F (375 degrees with convection).2. In a large bowl, combine sugar, flour, lemon zest, cinnamon, and salt. Add pears and dried blueberries and toss. Set aside.3. Roll out bottom pie dough and lay into a 9″ pie plate. Crimping the edges of the dough is optional.4. Spoon pear and blueberry mixture on to unbaked crust. Dot with butter and sprinkle with lemon juice.5. In a small bowl, mix together flour, brown sugar, and oats. Cut in the butter until it resembles course sand. Sprinkle evenly over the pie.6. Cover with aluminum foil and bake for 10 minutes. Remove foil and turn the oven down to 350 degrees F (325 degrees F with convection) and bake for another 45-55 minutes, or until pie is bubbling. Cool on wire rack.

I'm not the biggest fan of meringue but I couldn't resist making this cake because it looked so pretty in Nick Malgieri's book, Perfect Cakes. I can't post the recipe (don't want to violate any copyrights) but you can make something similar by following the concept.First, make lemon curd. I prefer doing it the night before.

You bring up a point in the post that I hope to discuss -- copyright of recipes -- however, this is not meant to be legal counsel or advice. Ok, now that my arse is covered...The front flap of Perfect Cakes lauds its own "uncomplicated instructions."  Much has been written about the copyright-ability of instructions. Examples include Martin Schwimmer, JD's blog on copyright (http://www.schwimmerlegal.com/2006/01/can_recipes_be.html) and IPWatchdog's (http://www.ipwatchdog.com/copyright/the-law-of-recipes/)Some grey areas arise, but I leave that up to your readers to ponder.THanks for the post.

Pulled Pork & Killer BBQ Sauce
CONTENT
Wandering through BJs the other day, Jessica spotted a luscious looking pork leg and asked if I thought we should make it. Of course my answer was \"YES!\" However, the two of us came to our senses and decided to just buy a pork shoulder weighing in at just under nine pounds, as opposed to the leg, which was probably 20 or 25 pounds.We debated a bit what style to prepare the butt, generally we were thinking either latin (like pernil) or southern (like BBQ). The last time or two that we cooked this cut we made pernil, so we opted for BBQ. I didn't have a favorite rub recipe on hand, so I did a lot of research and made up a new one. Oh boy, did it work out well.FoodMayhem BBQ Dry Rub~makes 1 cup of dry rubUnlike Andrew, my BBQ Smokemaster Cousin, I don't have a smoker... or a barbecue. Both are because we're in the city. So I had to go with the next best option: slow roasting. I know it's not true BBQ, but it's in the style of, and it worked out pretty darn good.Slow Roasted (BBQ-style) Pulled PorkRoast at 225 degrees F for about 12 hours until internal temperature reaches 195 degrees F. Around 9 hours, start checking every hour or so.Making this pork literally could not be easier. Basically, you rub spices on it, leave it alone. throw it in the oven, leave it alone. However, it wouldn't be me, if I didn't find a way to make it hard! Because we had guests coming for dinner at seven, and Jessica was going to be making a cake and fresh biscuits, we needed the oven clear. That meant I woke up at 4:45am to get the pork in the oven. Fortunately, it was pretty easy, and after it went in the oven, I ran back to bed.It wouldn't be pulled pork without BBQ sauce, so I made a really easy recipe for cooked BBQ sauce. This turned out to be the best part of my whole recipe. I loved it so much, I was putting it on everything from the biscuits to the sweet potatoes. When I served the pork, I poured a good amount of the sauce into a mixing bowl and tossed the pork with it. It's best to serve the pork dressed...FoodMayhem BBQ Sauce~makes about 2 cups of heavenIngredientsInstructionsWe hope you enjoy this recipe and share it with your friends. We tried it on Kaiser rolls and hamburger buns. The latter was better. We recommend any soft bun, like hamburger, brioche, challah, or potato rolls.

To the hosts, how would you rate this on the Time/Effort/Cost (TEC) to foodiness scale (ratio of amount of food to deliciousness of food)?
Lon
2009-01-05 15:09:00
Tim - I'd say it's TEC ratio is pretty high, because even though it takes a lot of waiting, it's not much work.  Really, just through the rub on, wait, roast, wait.  There is some work in pulling it, but it's repetitive and not complicated.  The cost of the meat is not too bad, and will feed an army

As the only person with a full size outdoor smoker on the Upper East Side,  I can say that I love your efforts. I can only offer one suggestions for your BBQ sauce. Dark Molasses.  Only a couple of tablespoons will set your bbq sauce off completely,  and will change the color, texture and flavor like you can't imagine. Try Grandma's brand,  they even sell it in Food Emporium. If you'd like, I can email pics of my BBQ successes,  as you are so into food porn!!!!
Jessica@Foodmayhem
2009-01-05 18:46:00

Tim
2009-01-06 14:03:00
I dunno Lon...Making the spice mix seems like lots of measuring. And what if you don't have everything...therein lies uh..the rub.  Do they sell OTC rubs? (I have crappy stores near me).
Lon
2009-01-06 21:31:00
Tim - Good point, measuring can weigh on you (best pun I could come up with on the fly).  The nice thing about rubs, are that you can scale them up, and they'll sit on the shelf for months without a problem.  Then you can use 'em when you need 'em.re: OTC rubs, yes! You can definitely buy many.  I watch those BBQ competitions on food network, etc. and the big bbq'ers are always selling their special rubs.  And I've noticed that most bbq restaurants sell theirs as well.

Nick's Pizza
CONTENT
Sometimes childhood favorites stand up to the memories. As you know from the Gingerbread Train Station, Jessica grew up in Forest Hills and had been telling me about Nick's Pizza Nick's Pizza for years. We chose an odd day to go, but it worked out very well.On Christmas Eve, my mom drove in to pick up Ice (our dog) and we got together at Nick's for some dinner. Amazingly they were open. Fortunately, it was the one time they were not packed. It seems every time we pass by, there is a line.We started with a salad. It was fine, nothing special, and the dressing was overpoweringly sweet. We were happy to have requested it on the side. In the future we'll skip the salad there.Nick's, named after owner Nick Angelis, seems to use a fairly standard pizza oven (curved front, instead of rectangular), no brick, or wood, or coal seemed to be around. The result was perfect thin crust pizza. The dough was thin, but not a cracker. It was chewy without being rubbery. A good contrast is Numero 28, where we often eat in Manhattan. The two taste so different, so it's nice to have more than one favorite place.The sauce was fresh tasting with lots of oregano and some basil. The tomatoes' natural sweetness was vibrant without overpowering. And the mozzarella was milky and rich. Our one complaint was that there wasn't enough cheese.We ordered half of the pizza with sausage. It was one of the best sausage we'd ever had. It was crumbled instead of sliced and it had ground fennel instead of whole seeds. The fennel flavor permeated much more evenly and was nicer than traditional Italian sausage.The price at Nick's was good and the service was fast. We were lucky to not wait on line and all enjoyed each bite of the pizza. If you find yourself in Forest Hills, make sure to stop by Nick's and have a bite.

Five Mushrooms in Vegetarian Oyster Sauce
CONTENT
You might remember seeing this dish, a glorious dish of mushrooms, we just had at Jade Asian Restaurant. I loved it so much, I wanted to replicate it. Coincidentally, my mom was thinking the same thing and had just made the dish for New Year's. She told me that the key was using Vegetarian Oyster Sauce, which is actually made from mushroom flavoring. She recommends the Wan Ja Shan brand.There are some notable ingredients in this dish. First, I used a vegetable that was labeled baby bok choy at the market but it's not, here's a pic since I don't know the name.A few of the mushrooms may be harder to find, but look in Chinese supermarkets. Dried black mushrooms are common but for this dish, make sure to use fresh ones. Just snip off the hard ends; the rest of the stem is fine. The King Oyster mushroom is that thick long one in front. It has an amazing texture when cooked, almost like abalone.Five Mushrooms in Vegetarian Oyster Sauce1. Heat a wok on high and swirl 1 teaspoon vegetable oil around. Add vegetable and sprinkle with salt. Stir around for a few minutes as the vegetable gives off liquid. The vegetable is done when it stops giving off liquid. Remove to serving plate.2. Make sure there's no water in the wok (the vegetable will give off liquid) and reduce to medium heat. Add remaining teaspoon of oil and swirl around. Add King oyster mushroom and 1 teaspoon vegetarian oyster sauce. Stir around for 2 minutes. Add black mushrooms and another teaspoon of oyster sauce. Stir around for another 2 minutes. Add the rest of the mushrooms and the remaining 2 tablespoons of vegetarian oyster sauce and stir as it cooks for about another 5 minutes, or until all the mushrooms have cooked through. Pile mushrooms on top of the vegetable and serve.

Cocoa Bar

After dinner at Pho So 1 we wanted dessert and ended up at Cocoa Bar Cocoa Bar. Right after reading the menu and looking around, we considered leaving. The prices were way up there, seeing chocolate covered marshmallows (1-2 bites worth) for $4+ and smaller chocolates for $2-$3 each. Since it was New Year's Day, we weren't sure if we'd find something else and stayed. What a mistake!Sarah and I had Spicy Hot Chocolates, which had just the right amount of spiciness, not-too-sweet, made with reasonably good ingredients. They were $4 each which is reasonable, I guess.How places like this are around (not to mention, they have another location in Brooklyn) amazes me, confuses me, and depresses me.

Pho So 1

After trying Pho in Los Angeles years ago, I kind of stopped eating it here in New York. I was just disappointed in the quality of the broth here, which seemed like a watered down version in comparison.When Sarah and Tim suggested trying Pho So 1 Pho So 1, I was up for the challenge but didn't expect too much. The cellar floor restaurant looks like a pretty standard Vietnamese restaurant but the service is especially friendly and happy. The menu is laminated and full of colorful pictures, which really does help.To my great surprise, the Pho was really good. (Sarah, Tim, and I, all got the version with everything: rib eye, flank, meatballs, tendons, and tripe.) The broth was full of flavor and comfort, seasoned perfectly, and it was one huge a** bowl. None of us were capable of finishing it.

A Sauerkraut Replacement?
CONTENT
Not to toot my own horn, but it may be possible that I've created a replacement for the several hundred year old classic brat topping sauerkraut. Actually, other than the use of cabbage, it's quite different: sweeter and mustardy. We've made other yummy cabbage dishes before, but this is different from those too. I really enjoy it and it will go great on your favorite brat, hot dog, smoked bacon, (or both combined) pork chops, or even regular ole Italian sausage.Mustard Sweet CabbageIngredientsInstructions

Spinach Artichoke Spread
CONTENT
We just came back from Maryland and our fridge is pretty empty. What could we make for lunch for Lon's family? Lon picked up some chicken but I wanted some simple sides, and using just what we had at home, we got this great Spinach Artichoke Spread. This variation feels much lighter than the standard because there's more vegetable than usual, but I'm not saying it's healthy. There's still tons of cream cheese and mayo.If you're still fumbling around for some last minute additions to your New Year's party menu, this would be a great addition.Spinach Artichoke SpreadInstructions-1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (350 degrees F with convection). Spray an 8×8 glass baking dish with non-stick spray.2. Bring a (3 1/2 qt) pot of water to a boil. Add spinach and stir for 2 seconds. Drain, cool, then ring out with paper towels.3. In a medium sized bowl, mix together cream cheese, mayonnaise, and garlic until smooth. Mix in spinach, artichokes, and gouda.4. Spread into prepared baking dish and level. Cover with aluminum foil and bake for 25 minutes. Uncover and bake for another 5-8 minutes, or until lightly golden. Serve with warm bread.

Jade Asian Restaurant - Banquet Style
CONTENT
We've posted about Jade Asian Restaurant Jade Asian Restaurant before, recommending the dim sum, but rating the dinner rather low. It's only fair to report that our most recent visit (dinner) was an improvement. It was a banquet in honor of Rebecca's (our cousin's baby) first birthday and the food was very good.We started with a beautiful cold plate, an assortment of Chinese style cold cuts, and jellyfish on top of pickled veggies.By now, I was too full and only took a few bites of fried rice, but it was good.

If you know what a Marvel Stripe and a Dr. Carolyn are, then you're better than me. For those of you who don't, you need to have a look at the Tomatoes picture reference page, hosted by D. Landreth Seed Company. Amazingly they have been selling seeds since 1784.By the way, if you're curious why I picked those varieties to mention, it's because the Marvel Stripe is the Mexican equivalent of a beefsteak and is the largest of variegated tomatoes, weighing over two pounds each! And the Dr. Carolyn is supposedly the best tasting of all tomatoes, and sadly I've never tasted one.

Remember the other day when we made the Coconut Mango Rice? Well, we had several mangoes left over, chilling out in our fridge (since we were away).In this recipe, I used Trader Joe's Organic Blue Agave Sweetener. I love how it has a delicate sweetness that I haven't found in any other sweetener. It's so natural and a great choice for a light dessert like this. If you don't have any agave sweetener you can substitute with honey, but it will be much stronger.IngredientsInstructions

Yumiko brought a bag of Cheeza from Japan. The Camembert flavored crackers are so good, but not available here (to my knowledge), and really taste like Camembert. I ate some of them with black grapes and they were fabulous.How come our (in the US) cheese crackers are almost always cheddar? There are so many great cheeses...imagine the possibilities.Anyone coming from Japan? Please bring me a case.

Seven Seas Chinese Restaurant

For our last evening in Maryland, we gathered for a big Chinese banquet at Seven Seas Chinese Restaurant Seven Seas Chinese Restaurant, where we had our own room for our party of 20.We started with a set of cold appetizers, which were impressively presented. The first was Abalone, tossed in some spicy oil. This is a very traditional preparation and I love it.In comparison, I still favor the places we have in Flushing, but according to my uncles, this is the best Chin ese they have in town.

I am impressed such food is available in Maryland (thank you Chinatown buses!).  I agree with you that the lack of presentation (and service) is holding back Chinese food.$40 a person is pretty decent; about what you'd pay in NYC.  I think the lower economy of scale is offset by lower operating expenses.  But anyway, I had a banquet dinner last year at Sunrise 27 on East Broadway.  (It was Michelin listed.)  My guest were quite satified- even the Chinese folks.Anyone been to Pacificana in Sunset Park, Brooklyn.  Reviews are positive for dimsum but dinner seems rather expensive?
Jessica@Foodmayhem
2008-12-30 18:51:00
Justin, stop drooling.Tim, $40 is what you'd pay here but the last two dishes would be fried rice and noodles. Also, the cold appetizer would just be one plate.I'm sure they have lower rent there...I haven't been to Pacificana but sampled something from them at a food event. I'd be down for going to try the dim sum....who's in?

My cousins in Maryland like a fast food chain called Moby Dick's Moby Dick's, so a crowd of us went for an early lunch on Saturday. I'm impressed that the suburbs have Persian fast food, but does it still qualify if they are really really slow?I tasted some of my cousins hummus, which was pretty good, thick, and didn't skimp on the tahini. The flatbread is also freshly made in a tandoor, with the good texture of stretchy pizza dough.

Patisserie Poupon
CONTENT
After touring the Baltimore Aquarium, my dad spotted a tall narrow building and wanted to know what it was. Lon guessed that it was a shot tower and turned out to be right (the Phoenix Shot Tower to be precise). As we drove over to take a clsoer look, my brother spotted Patisserie Poupon Patisserie Poupon - Baltimore. We needed to kill some time anyway so an afternoon dessert break was perfect.My coffee was weak (watered down) but everything else was great, not-too-sweet, fresh, and reminiscent of Europe. One was a Chocolate Almond Layer Cake, indulgent without weighing you down.The Mocha Eclair was creamy and balanced.The Pear Tart was flaky, buttery, and very natural tasting. My dad was so impressed, he immediately purchased another one. The rest of us agreed... it was really that good and totally deserving of all the praise.As we sat around eating the wonderful desserts we chatted with a staff member who pointed out Chef Joseph Poupon working away just past the window behind the counter. Lon kept raving about the huge block of butter he was using.Everyone was so happy, my brother decided to by a whole cake to bring to our uncle's house later. The Choclate Hazelnut Mousse Cake was strikingly beautiful and everyone (about 12 or more people) who tasted it loved it. Some were reminded of a Ferrero Rocher and I could see why -- it was chocolate and hazelnut and there was a layer of wafer along with cake and mousse. It was much less sweet than the supermarket sweets and more sophisticated.The prices for the single serve pastries were similar to NYC prices ($5 - $7 each), which surprised us, but the whole cake at $36 is a relative steal. Either way, their products are really superb, made with top notch ingredients, restraint on sugar, and look beautiful. We'd definitely be regulars if we lived in the area.

Baltimore Trip - Lexington Market
CONTENT
Recently we watched an episode of \"Road Tasted with the Neelys\". It seems Food Network is truly scraping the bottom of the food world barrel; not that Pat & Gina aren’t wonderful, but to re-use them twice on two new shows is odd—to me. And the real trouble is that they were sent to Baltimore, MD for one of their first episodes. Baltimore is really not a food city and finding good food there isn’t easy. How do I know that? Because this holiday season, we took a road trip down to Maryland to see family. I figured since we were close (about an hour) outside of Baltimore, it was worth the drive to check out the food scene. It wasn’t exciting, but we did find some bright spots.First place we went was to Lexington Market Lexington Market to try out the Neely’s recommendation for Faidley’s Seafood’s Jumbo Lump Crab Cake. We circled the block once noticing that it was basically semi-ghetto (sorry area), filled with pawn shops, check cashing shops, and other run-down retail fronts. Even the market's website is semi-ghetto. Inside the market, the scene was equally sad, filled with food places that hocked various food that had been deep fried, heated under heat lamps, and then re-deep fried. There was a rockin’ band performing in the middle of the market, which kept the Friday afternoon atmosphere light. There were barbecue stands, Chinese fast-food stands, hot dog stands, as well as raw meat and fish shops. One of those fish shops was Faidley’s.Faidley’s is not a restaurant. The part closer to the center of the market is a raw seafood market, selling lobster and fish at what seemed like high prices; at least equivalent to New York City prices ($16.95 per pound for lobster). The part closer to the street was a prepared food area with standing bar tables for chowing down. And in the center is a raw bar where you can stand around the chef and eat. We first sped through the line of hot food and got two Jumbo Lump Crab Cakes, which for $12.95 (plus tax) each, include frozen tomatoes, a piece of lettuce, and a cup of tartar sauce. The cakes are literally the size of a baseball, filled with huge pieces of crab, perfectly un-broken. They use saltines as filler, but there isn’t too much of them. And the outside is crispy from being deep fried. There is no real additional flavor; it just tastes of good crab and saltines, which is good and bad. It’s not so much a crab cake as a pile of crab. I enjoyed it and Jessica thought it was fine, but not worth the price. The atmosphere was not appetizing and we agreed that neither of us would want to go back, even if we lived there.However, since we were there, we kept eating. We walked over to the raw bar and ordered a plate of six raw, fresh shucked (while we watched) “prime” oysters (as opposed to medium), which were $8.40 (including tax). The young man skillfully cleaned, shucked, and flipped our huge oysters; and impressed us by discarding one oyster that didn’t look quite right. It turns out he was the grandson of Faidley’s founder (or some similar relation). We added a bit of fresh lemon juice and cocktail sauce and slurped each oyster down. They were fantastic! Huge, fresh, and each had at least half an ounce of liquor.We decided to check out the rest of Lexington Market. We stopped by another stand that sold various chicken parts, deep fried. Jessica’s dad wanted to try the Fried Gizzards, with salt and pepper. They were remarkably greasy and not worth discussing, other than to tell you that your doctor would advise you not to eat them. Although, if you like gizzards, it’s nice to know that you get a huge amount for about $3.Nothing else in the market enticed us and we wanted to try Dangerously Delicious Pies, also recommended by the Neely’s. Sadly, we discovered they were closed, so we couldn’t try them. We headed over to the National Aquarium in Baltimore to see what some of the seafood looked like when it was alive.All in all, the oysters made our afternoon worthwhile, but the rest was a let down. If you recall, I did mention that there is a gem in the rough in Baltimore, and in our next post we’ll tell you what it is. Oh boy is it worth waiting for.

According to a friend of mine who analyzes consumer data for the Food Network, African American viewers (particularly those in cities like Baltimore, NYC, Chicago and Detroit) do not feel represented by the network. The rise of Rachel Ray, Giada de Laurentis (sp?), and other semi celebrities has also called attention to the lack of diverse representation on the channel.That was word for word from her email. Haha!

Alta (visit #2)
CONTENT
Can I pay a bigger compliment than to visit a restaurant again? Well, I guess, bringing a friend (my childhood best friend, Yumiko, is visiting from Japan) is yet another notch up.So, obviously, I enjoyed my first visit to Alta, but I think we enjoyed it even more this time. Right off the bat, their Fried Goat Cheese with Lavendar Scented Honey is a must have! While fried goat cheese is always great, this is the lightest version we've ever had. The cheese seemed to be herbed and whipped. The coating was similar to panko, perhaps a finer ground version. Just fabulous!

Rosemary Porcini Rubbed Short Ribs
CONTENT
It's Christmas Day! (This post was intended for early in the day but our hosting company is having problems.) If you need one more thing to add to your menu, this one is easy and will impress. I happened upon this interesting way of using dried porcini mushrooms ground into a powder. The recipe was for rib eye steaks but we decided to use it on Beef Short Ribs and the result was fantastic. The magical pairing of rosemary and porcini, two earthy ingredients strong enough to stand up to each other, is a real winner!Rosemary Porcini Rubbed Short Ribs~adapted from Bruce Aidells recipeInstructions-1. Put soy sauce in a 9X13 dish. Lay short ribs in, turn to coat, and rest in room temperature for 2 hours, turning occasionally.2. While the beef is marinating, grind porcini in a spice/coffee grinder into a fine powder. Mix with rosemary and pepper in a small bowl and set aside. Fire up the grill when you think it's necessary. (Different grills take different amounts of time to heat up.)3. When beef is done marinating, pat dry with paper towel. Rub with porcini rosemary mixture all over.4. Grill to your liking. (On our grill, we do 3 minutes on each side.) Serve immediately.

For a full review of Numero 28, read my first review (more comprehensive) and my second (a confirmation). We've been back several times, and I don't have much to add, but the old posts don't have good pics of the food, so I thought you'd appreciate having some.They have fresh salads covered in copious amounts of cheese.

Fish Head Soup
CONTENT
As a holiday gift, I'm giving you the recipe for one of my all time favorite things to eat in the winter: Fish Head Soup. I asked my mom to teach me how to make it the other day. Unfortunately, that means some of the measurements are not exact. I did my best to catch things and measure them before my mom threw it in, but sometimes I failed. Use this as a guideline, then taste, and adjust to preference.Traditionally, Fish Head Soup is made with a fish head, but they messed up at the supermarket. My mom asked them to cut the fish in half and instead of cutting it in half cross-wise, they cut it length-wise. You can make it either way.Fish Head SoupInstructions1. Soak mushrooms in 1 cup of warm water for 4 hours. Soak green been starch sheet in warm water for 1 hour. Remove from water and tear into pieces (roughly 2″ squares) by hand.2. Cut fish in half, wash, and dry. Heat oil in a wok until you see smoke. Fry the fish skin side down, until it looks cooked through and flesh side looks opaque. Turn it over and fry until golden. Remove to a paper towel.3. In a small bowl, stir together pork, soy sauce, and corn starch. Set aside.4. Squeeze water out of mushrooms and reserve liquid. Slice mushrooms. Set aside.5. In a medium sized pot, heat 1 teaspoon of the oil you just fried the fish in. Add pork mixture and brown lightly. Stir in Broad Bean Paste with Chili and Hoisin Sauce. Add 4 cups of water, fish, bamboo slices, ginger, mushrooms and their liquid, bouillon, salt, and sugar. Bring to a boil.6. Add frozen tofu. Cover and simmer for 5 minutes. Stir in the starch sheets and leeks and serve. (Everything except the starch sheets and leek can be made a day ahead and refrigerated. When you want to serve, bring it to a boil, then add starch sheets and leek to serve.)OK, I'm totally retarded and forgot to take a picture of the final product. Guess you'll have to make it to see it.

fish head is used a lot in Bengali food. My favourite is 'maccher mudo diye daal'. This means daal flavoured with fish head. I truly began to feel at home at Bombay only after I began to make it here. Another popular dish is 'mudi ghonto' which is a garam masala based fish head curry cooked with fine, firm rice. Fish head is also used to flavour dishes made with cabbages, gourd or spinach. Bnegalis love fish much more than they like vegetables!

Anonymous, a month? I hope it's in the freezer. If not, throw it out. For simpler, try stewing it with some canned tomatoes and other veggies. If you have small children, be careful with the bones and pieces.

Caribbean Shrimp over Coconut Mango Rice
CONTENT
On the coldest day of the Winter so far, 0 degrees F (-18 C), what better way is there to make yourself feel warm then by pretending you're in the Caribbean, eating some tropical food? Yes, insanity is our friend. Well, what really happened was Olivia brought us some Fresh Coconut and a day or two earlier, Jessica's mom brought us some wonderful mangos.While reading about how to handle fresh coconut, I stumbled upon a recipe for Coconut Mango Rice. I excluded the green onion, but otherwise followed it exactly. The nice spin was (again) that I used freshly made coconut milk.Then I made up my own recipe for a main entree. Unfortunately, I didn't write down the exact recipe, but here's the gist.I melted the coconut oil in some extra virgin olive oil. Then I sauteed sliced red onion and red bell pepper with kosher salt until soft. I added minced ginger, garlic, and sliced jalapeno pepper. I seasoned with freshly ground coriander, mixed peppercorns, and cloves. When fragrant, I added large shrimp cut in half and some lime juice. After about two minutes, I cut the heat and added a slurry of corn starch and fresh coconut milk.We served the shrimp over the rice. It was wonderful! The acidity from the lime cut the fat from coconut, and the sweetness of the mango balanced the slight heat from the jalapeno.

When You're Given Coconuts...
CONTENT
Olivia surprised us with a visit yesterday, bringing some very interesting fruit from Florida (we'll write about those in another post). But also brought us something we had never eaten -- fresh coconut right off the tree!There's two reasons Jessica and I hadn't tried fresh coconut: first we don't live near palm trees; and second, we're not big fans of coconut. However, as chefs, when you're given a wonderful fresh ingredient, you use it!Olivia's mom managed to peel the coconut by hand! And Olivia had been instructed to drill through the eye of coconut. We used a cleaned 1/4-inch drill bit, then shoved in a straw. It was so refreshing. We drank the Coconut Water until no more would come out, then we poured the rest into a bowl and drank that.Next I smacked the outer husk with the back of my 10″ chef's knife and cracked the coconut into various pieces. Then I used a basic table knife (like a butter knife) to separate the meat from the outer husk. This was done by wedging the knife sideways between the meat and the husk, while resting the piece on a kitchen towel. This is a similar technique to opening an oyster. In an assembly line-like fashion, Olivia took over using the vegetable peeler to remove the inner husk from the meat.We snacked on pieces of the fresh meat. It had an unbelievable taste. The initial bite had a very standard coconut sensation: fibrous texture and coconut milk flavor. But then, an incredibly rich aftertaste, like drinking heavy cream. It was remarkable; and I say that while admitting that I don't care for coconut, usually.I wanted to make coconut shrimp. But Jessica reminded me that usually dry, shredded coconut is required and fresh would be too moist. So then I decided to make some Coconut Milk. It's pretty easy, although I used a slightly different process than standard. Rather than cubing the meat, I put it all in a food processor and shredded it. Then I transferred half the meat into a blender and filled it with room-temperature water and let it run for about three minutes.I poured 1/3rd of the blender contents into a fine mesh strainer over a bowl and pressed it with a spoon. I tried to extract as much liquid as possible. Then I dumped the dried meat in a separate bowl. I repeated with the 2nd and 3rd parts of the blender. Then the whole process was repeated with the second half of the meat still sitting in the food processor.And when that was done, I put all of the dried meat back in the blender, and filled with a bit more water and ran it again. Then I did it again. After I got all the meat and liquid out of the blender, there was a thick paste at the bottom of the blender. I was so surprised. Jessica informed me it was Coconut Fat (or Oil) -- whoa!!! I had accidentally made coconut butter. I tasted it straight, it was sensational and I was inspired.In the end we had three fantastic, totally separate products.We had dried, ground coconut left with a very subtle coconut flavor. Olivia took this home to either use in cereal or as plant food. We had fresh coconut milk, which I used in two dishes that night. And we had pure coconut oil, which I also used. A separate post is coming on our coconut dishes.Woot woot for fresh coconut!

Payard... Panned!
CONTENT
We celebrated the holidays with family at Payard Payard NY. Named after famed French pastry Chef Francois Payard, the restaurant is notable for dessert. Reservations, however, are reserved (pun, sorry) for those who eat non-dessert food. Kasi and Stephen gave a super generous gift certificate to Payard for my birthday, so we decided to share it with family.I will summarize the experience for those who don't want to read all of my complaining: don't go to Payard, at least not for non-pastry food.The menu announces the Chef du Cuisine is Philippe Bertineau, born in a rural area in Western France. There are some classic French dishes on the menu and it sounds pretty good, but the overall experience is BAD.We shared a salad of Warm Crab on a Smoked Quinoa Galette with Oakwood Shiitake, Chives and Frisée Wild Mushroom Broth. The nice part of this dish was that it was very earthy, the mushrooms provided a robust flavor. However, they completely overpowered the lightly flavored crab, which was mostly shredded, no good size pieces to at least provide crab texture. The quinoa galette looked attractive, but was rock hard (perhaps to withstand sitting in a broth?). It bothered me to eat the cardboard-like item. Jessica and her mom thought the mushrooms were wonderful though. I felt the dish was unbalanced.I also had a Lentil Soup with Lardons and Croutons. This was by far the most enjoyable part of the meal. The ugly soup (a dark brown) was saturated with butter, making it luxurious. The heartiness of the lentils balanced the fat. The lardons were a welcome treat, as were the croutons. Both provided an alternate texture that worked so well. I ate every last drop of the perfect winter soup.My mother-in-law had the Black Angus Hanger Steak with Homemade French Fries and Béarnaise Sauce. She enjoyed it and appreciated it being cooked perfectly. However, neither the steak nor the fries were correctly seasoned.Three of us, including Jessica, had the Bouillabaisse with Chilean Sea Bass, Clams, Mussels and Calamari. Everyone found it too salty and not enjoyable, I don't believe anyone finished it, and we're good eaters! The seafood was mediocre, and Jessica suggested that the broth was closer to a curry texture, perhaps because of the potatoes, than bouillabaisse. The aioli it was served with was bland and the three tiny toast points were kind of a waste of time (why only three tiny pieces?).I saved the worst for last: I ordered the Risotto with Duck Confit. The waiter made a weird comment when I placed the order and had I been more clever, I'd have realized to change my order. First, it wasn't risotto, it was just over-cooked rice. Second, if there was duck in there, it was turned into \"duck dust\", which would be special at Il Bulli, but was annoying at Payard. Third, it had long strands of what I suspect was radicchio, but might have been purple cabbage. It looked more like cabbage, but was incredibly bitter like radicchio. Fourth, the whole shabang sat in a foamy pool of nastiness, I don't know what it was. I ate 3-4 bites of my dish and pushed it aside. Yuck! Bertineau should be ashamed of himself.At the end of our meal, we selected five interesting sounding pastries and waited for them to arrive. Did I mention that the service at Payard is incredibly slow? It is, horribly slow. And they kept bumping into my chair. Also, did I mention that we could only select from about half their normal pastry menu, because they were out of so many items? On a Sunday brunch... um, do they not understand how unacceptable that is? Now Payard should be ashamed of himself.Anyway, the pastries arrived and they were beautiful. Classic French patisserie fare. It seemed the Beaux-Arts was our winner, by a narrow margin. It was a mousse-like cake with Cassis flavor, with Passion Fruit Cream and Sablé Breton and Raspberry Coulis, and decorated with macarons. It was fruity, tangy, and delicious.My favorite, also the waiter's selection, was the Piémont, Hazelnut Cream with Roasted Hazelnuts, Milk Chocolate Gianduja Mousse, Caramel Glaze and Fleur de Sel. It's perfect for those who like the salty sweet combination.Other items we had and enjoyed equally included: Louvre, a Chocolate Mousse, Hazelnut Mousse, Hazelnut Dacquoise and Hazelnut Wafer;Bergamote, an Earl Grey Tea Chocolate Mousse layered with Cherry Pain de Gênes and Red Berry Gelée; and the Hazelnut Napoleon, a Flaky Puff Pastry layered with Hazelnut Cream and Crispy Wafer.During dessert I noticed that the tables didn't match the rest of the restaurant decor. The restaurant is quite attractive, except the tables look run down and nasty and seem to belong in an old Jewish deli more than in an upscale French patisserie.We took home a 1/4 lb. Ballotin box with a mix of chocolate treats. We enjoyed most of them but they weren't memorable.So, to summarize, if it's not already incredibly obvious, don't waste your time eating at Payard, except perhaps desserts. And while their desserts are good, they don't even have them all on hand regularly; plus they don't seem to take reservations for just dessert. It came out to a whopping $307 (including tax and tip) for 6 people, which is way too much money for hit or miss food.

At Payard, we actually used our flash, which we try really hard to avoid.  But the lighting in there was awkward and we needed it.  We understand that the flash disturbs other patrons, so we hold up napkins (which helps our photo quality anyway) to block the flash, and try to limit the number of photos.We also carry this mini tripod to use a slower shutter speed and we bump to ISO 1600 in extraordinary circumstances.At the end of the day, if a restaurant considers it their right to refuse to let us take pictures, we consider refusing to eat there our right! =)

I think it's  pretty much accepted that unless the  place specializes in brunch, you're going to get the b level service for brunch.  The  servers aren't happy to be there, the food was delivered on Friday, and the good chefs have that shift off.  Of course this is inexcusable at a good restaurant, and certainly inexcusable at that price.  That said, I doubt I would ever go to a "name" restaurant for brunch.  I'll  stick  with Norma's or my fancy brunches.

After our Gingerbread Station was made, we had some gingerbread left-over, tons of candy, and tons of royal icing. In this house, nothing can go to waste, so I asked my brother, Justin, and his girlfriend, Sophia, if they wanted to come make some gingerbread creations of their own. I baked off the gingerbread in squares, rectangles, triangles, stars, and a few Christmas shapes before they came and just left them with it as I did some other cooking with my mom. Boy was I impressed with the totally creative stuff they came up with! I had to show you:The GhostbusterHappy Holidays!

For Gingerbread construction, read Part 1 and Part 2.DecoratingBecause of the weather, we limited ourselves to whatever candy we could find at the Duane Reade across the street. Twizzlers ended up being perfect for roof shingles, but they were a pain to cut, first lengthwise and then in segments.We added power lines (candy canes and pull-n-peel twizzlers) and it's done!

I don't know how I missed it, but all I can say is, you were really holding out on me! Your  GB station was so creatively done, with its arched entrance, red shingles, and even  power lines were added. Wonderfully detailed Jessica. Is it still standing or was it devoured at Christmas?Happy New Year to you!

Gingerbread Station Part 2: Baking & Assembly
CONTENT
I hope you read through part 1 and it didn't exhaust you.We started building the base with the Cheerios Marshmallow Treats and some granola bars.We used this gingerbread recipe for the structural walls. Our gingerbread looks very dark because we used black strap molasses.While the gingerbread cooled, I made a batch of this royal icing recipe. We started the station building...I decided to cover the floor with royal icing because I didn't like the seems.By this time, it was late, and we decided to go to bed. The next day, we worked on the roof, the bottom stairs, and the final decorations (which is part 3).Finish reading about Gingerbread Station in Part 3.

i wanted to tip my hat to you. this is bringing back memories of about 1985 when my dad decided it would be a great idea to get us to build a gingerbread house together. i think it took like 3 weekends to complete! it's hard work but worth it in the end so you can show it off.

Gingerbread Station Part 1: Planning Stage
CONTENT
Seeing pics of amazing gingerbread houses and various Food Network Challenges inspired us to try our hand in it. Neither of us like the taste of gingerbread, nor had we ever built gingerbread houses, but we thought this would be a fun mini-project. Although, it was our first try, I think we did a pretty good job considering the difficult design we chose.So what was the design? Jessica grew up in Forest Hills and used it for inspiration, but when she picked the Forest Hills Station of the LIRR in Station Square as a design goal, I almost fainted.First thing I did was hop on Google Maps and begin looking at satellite and street view images of the station. I had only ever walked past the area with Jessica, but hadn't otherwise been in it.To get a better idea of scale and sizing, I did some image manipulation to hack together various images to see the full front of the building. In this image, I overlaid edges with turquoise to help determine specific shapes.Then based on a scale Jessica selected, I began documenting the length of dimensions to scale. Then outlined edges with turquoise that aren't otherwise visible.All of those edges were then translated into piece templates, which we printed, cut out, and then used as guides for carving the gingerbread. Jessica had read that it's best to build the bottom structure first, let it dry overnight, then do the roof. So this set of templates is just for the base:So why did I almost faint? Because of that roof! In building lingo, it's called a hip roof. If it's not immediately obvious why it's so hard, check out the math of hip roofs. It seems from the map images that the eaves overhang, but there was just no way we were going to tackle that on our first attempt at a gingerbread house, hip roofing is hard enough without overhangs.While it took many uses of Pythagorean Theorem to calculate the hips, they were pretty straight-forward. The long roof length had a height (from gutter to ridge) of 1.5 inches, while the shorter roof length had a height of 1/2 inch. The hard part was creating a 3D model of the valley and conjuring some 7th grade trigonometry to figure out the angles. Mostly this was done doodling on paper with a calculator. But I translated the critical model here, for you to get an idea of what I was doing:Here's the gist, the grey/black represents the roofing. The blue triangle represents where the hip would end if it didn't have to form the valley with the main pitch. Therefore the red triangle represents the area to add to the hip so that the ridge of the hip met the main roof field. So my end goal was to determine the adjacent length of the red triangle, labeled a. To do this, I started with what I knew, the green triangle. I knew the height of the main roof, which is all I needed to calculate the theta via some trig, result: 41.3 degrees. In roofing terms, that is known as a 10.54/12 pitch.Then I applied that to the red triangle, where I already knew the opposite length, which was the height of the hip. A little more trig, and the resulting a was 0.57 inches.After all of this, we had what we needed to start baking and building. Continue reading in Part 2.

Hi Guys,  This is a truly awesome project.  While the math is obviously child's play (I can't ever remember being a child...) the tough question is, "What materials to assign to the various parts of the building.  What are the cheerios going to be?  Roof, walls?  Also, have you found someone scale sized, who's willing to stand in front of it like in the photo?  I'd love to see this in person.  - Marcos

I've been wanting to try Clinton Street Baking Company Clinton Street Baking Company for a long time but deterred by the long lines. I figured a weekday would be better so I made plans to meet Emily there for lunch yesterday. With the heavy snow coming down, I was shocked to see how full they were. I put my name down and the hostess said it would be a 40 minute wait. Luckily, it was more like 30 minutes but still...Emily is a vegetarian so in the interest of sharing, I gave up meat and cheese for this meal. I wanted the blueberry pancakes anyway and what a good choice!They were super fluffy pancakes and seriously packed with blueberries. The perfect level of sweetness allows you to skip the maple syrup (in this case maple butter). I finally found someone (Emily) who agrees with me on preferring not to use syrup. It's a texture thing. It makes the pancakes soggy.

Kudos to you guys for waiting that amount of time in the cold.  I remember a 90-minute wait once on a cold Sunday morning. During the wait, one of the waiters served us cookies to reward our patience.  In the end, those pancakes were definitely well worth it.

Grom
CONTENT
Grom Grom, a gelato shop from Italy, has two location in NY. The flavors are so interesting, stuff like Zabaione, Fiordilatte, Malaga, Cassata Siciliana, etc. (Sorry for the horrid picture.)Between the four of us (Tim, Melinda, me, and Lon), we ordered Pistachio, Hazelnut, Pannetone, and a dark hot chocolate. At first, I though the prices were quite steep ($4.75 for a small cup), but after tasting, I can appreciate the price. They really use good ingredients (see more info on their site). The pistachio was the most natural I've tasted. The Pannetone really tasted like that sweet holiday bread. They were all rich, packed with real flavor, and overall, the closest to actual Gelato we've had in New York. But, we still have one major complaint. Most of them were so excessively sweet, not just to me, but for Lon too. As much as he liked the Pannetone, less than half was eaten. Seeing as how they have locations all over Italy, we've been wondering if they make sweeter version for their US (only NY so far) locations?Aside, the dark hot chocolate was like pure liquid chocolate and good for two sips but just too thick and heavy for anyone to continue. We did discover another use for it though, chocolate sauce. The bitterness cuts the overly sweet gelato nicely. Still, less than half was finished so I'm not sure it's worth the $5.

Cheddar & Chive Biscuits a la BLT Fish
CONTENT
We've been to BLT Fish twice and both times, we had these amazing Cheddar & Chive Biscuits. They come out warm with maple syrup butter, and a cute little card with the recipe on it. Both times, I have somehow misplaced the recipe card (it's very teeny) but luckily Gothamist posted the recipe.It's a really easy recipe, done in a stand mixer, scooped into muffin tins, and baked. The batter actually looked like tuna fish salad to me.The result is delicious, BUT, it's not the real recipe. It was probably simplified for home use. I'm pretty sure the one they serve in the restaurant is not baked in a muffin tin. Also, this recipe (home-use) yields a velvety soft inside, while the one in the restaurant has a bit more body and has distinct layers.If it sounds like I'm complaining, I'm not. This is still a fantastic recipe. The flavor is all there, creamy and cheesy, with the aroma of fresh biscuit dough, a little kick, and really well seasoned. Would I use this recipe again? Hell Yes! Will I play around with it too to get that restaurant quality texture? You betcha!

I haven't been to Beyoglu Beyoglu in over two years so it was time to check if anything had changed. Like my last review, the thick pitas were a bit inconsistent, some warm and soft, some cold and dry, but overall rather average. Sadly, the octopus salad turned out to be quite chewy and I think the recipe/flavor has changed too. It's no longer exciting, nor notable.

I recently sampled 3 products from Intentional Chocolate, a chocolate company that differentiates itself from the saturated market by infusing their chocolate with good intent. At first, I thought that was really corny, but you know how grandma's food is so good because it's made with love, well, they're working under that same premise. I'm not sure I'm sold on that yet, but what I am sold on is just plain old good chocolate, especially when it's dark chocolate.Their cute box of Love Truffles comes with three different flavors: Tahitian Vanilla (the only one we didn't like), Lilikoi (my favorite), and Kona Coffee (Lon's favorite).These would make cute gifts for your favorite chocolate lover!

I love good packaging. Chocolates in individual boxes is genius. I hate when they melt a bit and get all stuck together. Plus, it'll be easier to grab one and stick it in my purse for later or to share with someone who might be a germaphobe and not want different fingers near their chocolate.

Making Chili Oil
CONTENT
In preparation for making hot pot yesterday, I wanted to make some Chili Oil, a necessary ingredient in spicy hot pot. Fortunately, it's pretty easy and fast to make, having only three ingredients.First, de-seed a handful of Chiles de Arbol and then grind them in a spice grinder. The result should resemble flakes, not powder. These dried chilis are about 10-15x spicier than Jalapenos, so be careful not to touch your eyes or nose while working. Put the chilis into a heat-resistant container, large enough to hold the oil.Second, heat about 300ml of canola or peanut oil over medium-high heat until it begins to smoke. Continue to let it smoke for about 20 seconds then remove from heat and let cool for three minutes. Then pour over the chilis. Add 1 teaspoon of sesame oil.Let the oil sit at room temp for at least an hour, preferably several hours. Strain the oil, which should now be a beautiful orange color, into a final vessel (I love the look in a clear wine bottle). I prefer to leave some flakes in, but others prefer it perfectly clear.For an aesthetic touch (and to remind you what's in the bottle) add a whole chili to the bottle.Enjoy your hot oil!

Mom's Hot Pot Sauce
CONTENT
If you go to a hot pot restaurant, they usually supply you with several ingredients to make your own dipping sauce. This is because everyone has their own preference, based on personal taste or region they're from. The variations of hot pot dipping sauce are endless but my favorite has always been my mom's sauce. Lon loves it too!Mom's Hot Pot SauceUsing a fork, crush chili bean cubes. Stir in the rest of the ingredients and you're ready to dip.

Frozen Tofu
CONTENT
Frozen Tofu (or Dong Dofu) is made by taking regular tofu (sitting in water), and freezing it, then defrosting it. That's it. It changes the texture, becoming very spongy, soaking up sauce and liquid very well. This makes it great for soups and hot pot.

Irving Mill
CONTENT
I've walked by Irving Mill Irving Mill several times before thinking it was a bar. I was totally surprised to see a very large country style dining room. We absolutely loved the atmosphere, well-lit and spacious. It just felt so comfortable, like a vacation from the city. The menu seemed focused on eggs and pigs, fitting for such a space, so we over-ordered, as we often do.The Cream of Wheat Griddle Cakes (with huckleberry jam and maple syrup) peaked my interest, something I've never seen. It's a nice alternative texture to regular pancakes. You'll notice the cream of wheat but it's not at all gritty and remains very soft. Just two (roughly 6″) pieces seems a bit small for $9.The Egg Sandwich averaged out to ok, with good bacon, excellent fluffy eggs, but a dry biscuit. The gravy helped but it needed a bit more help. It seems that someone forgot to dress the salad. At $10, it's fine.The Brunch Charcroute Plate was also a mix of hit and miss. Lon liked the Boudin Noir, not the Boudin Blanc. I found neither of interest, the noir extra gamey, the blanc oddly lemon-y. The Pork Belly was peppered but not salted (at all), but we liked the smudge of Pork and Liver Rillette on toast. It was flavorful and seasoned. The dish comes with two poached eggs and they were nice enough to change one to scrambled for Lon (who does not like poached eggs). My poached egg was perfect and seasoned. Almost forgot the cabbage underneath, which was really sad, vinegary and extra salty, but missed the right balance.

Tonkatsu
CONTENT
Tonkatsu is simply pork cutlets, considered part of a whole genre of food called Yoshoku, Japanese interpretations of Western food. Well here's my take on it. You'll notice a little bit of Malaysian curry powder, which adds just a touch of something special and a teeny kick. No one will be able to tell what the secret ingredient is though.Tonkatsu~2-4 servingsSaucePork CutletsInstructions1. Put all the sauce ingredients in a small pot and heat on medium high heat. Bring to a boil and reduce to a simmer and stir. Continue stirring as it reduces and thickens to a gravy-like consistency, roughly 2 minutes. Turn off the heat and set aside to cool.2. Season pork cutlets on both sides with salt and pepper. Set up 3 shallow bowls: one with flour and curry powder mixed together, one with the egg, one with panko.3. Heat oil in a 12″ skillet on medium high heat. Coat pork cutlets with flour mixture, dusting off excess. Dip in egg, then panko. Bread all the cutlets, then fry all 4 together, for 2-3 minutes on each side, or until golden brown.4. Remove onto paper towels, slice, serve with sauce (over rice if desired).

My cousins wanted to grab dim sum in Chinatown so we gave Jing Star (formerly Sunrise 27) Jing Star a shot. It serves very standard dim sum items of average quality for Chinatown, which means it's just ok. I'd still prefer Flushing by leaps and bounds. The one stand out item was the chive dumplings but it's no fun just eating one plate over and over again. This may seem like a pointless post but I think it's just as important to note the bad or mediocre restaurants so you know not to waste your time and money.

Vanilla-Chocolate Swirl Cheesecake
CONTENT
It's been a while since I posted about cheesecake, but for the devoted FoodMayhemites, you know I love me some cheesecake. So for our early Hanukkah celebration, I decided to create a new recipe (as I've done before). The only real requirements were that it include fresh vanilla bean and use an Oreo crust. Both of these requirements were simply due to having the ingredients on hand.The inspiration came from the Oreos themselves. The whole cake is kind of like a mashed up Oreo, but a bit fancier. When you bite into it, the scent of vanilla fills your nose and the creaminess coats your tongue. Then the rich chocolate flavor, enhanced by the vanilla, takes over, and it's like drinking really rich chocolate milk.Unlike my normal cooking, where I write the recipe down as I cook; baking needs a bit more thought. I spent over an hour working up this recipe before even walking into the kitchen. It got rave reviews from the test subjects. I hope you enjoy it too...Vanilla - Chocolate Swirl Cheesecake~makes one 9″ cakeIngredientsInstructions1. While softening cream cheese, open vanilla bean, scrape seeds into heavy cream, cut pod length in half, drop in cream. Refrigerate for an hour.2. Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Boil a pot of water (in a tea kettle is preferable). Wrap outside of 9-inch springform pan in aluminum foil.3. Combine the melted butter and cookie crumbs. Press into a 9-inch springform. Pack tightly along the bottom and one inch up the side. Set aside.4. In at least two cup mixing bowl, dissolve cocoa, vanilla extract, and 2 tbsp. sugar into warmed milk. Set aside.5. Cream together cream cheese and sugar until smooth. Beat in eggs one at a time. Blend in heavy cream / vanilla mixture (remove pod casings first, leave seeds).6. Add 1/2 cup of cream cheese mixture to cocoa mixture. Combine thoroughly.7. Pour half of cream cheese mixture over crust in pan. Spoon 1/2 of the cocoa mixture into pan. Pour remaining cream cheese mixture into pan. Pour remaining cocoa mixture into pan in several separate spots (not evenly). Swirl with tip of knife or skewer to create a marbled effect.8. Move pan into a larger tray for water bath, and put in pre-heated oven. Fill tray at least one inch with water from tea kettle. Bake 45-55 min at 325... do not open the oven during baking! Around 45 min start keeping an eye on the cake. It should be set around the edges and slightly gelatinous in the middle. This means it is done.9. When done, turn off the oven and open the over door about two inches. Leave it this way for another hour. Afterward, wrap the pan (leave the aluminum foil on) in saran wrap and refrigerate over night.

Pearl - You can do it!  Just remember the tips I mentioned (about not over cooking and leaving it in the oven while it cools down)Thanks Manger... It was a crime, but it sounds like you've repentedWonders, in most recipes you can use vanilla extract in place of the bean, you just need to account for the extra liquid.  In this recipe, I'd recommend adding two teaspoons of vanilla extract to the heavy cream, but don't reduce any liquid.  Let me know how it comes out!  Btw, you can easily order vanilla bean online, but it is pricey with shipping.Thanks Mary!Manasi, good question! The main answer is annoying: experience.  I've made dozens of cheesecakes and I know what each of the ingredients does.  And yes, there are definitely rules.  In the end, you have to just experiment.

Bah Kut Tea
CONTENT
When my friend Sheryl went to Singapore, she asked me what I wanted. I said, anything edible that I can't get here. She brought me several packets of Bah Kut Tea Spices, a sachet of spices that you cook in a soup to make it a Bah Kut Tea (translated to Meat Bone Tea). The most popular type is made with pork ribs.Awesome, it's something I've never had before, and I've never even heard of before. The cooking instructions on the back of the packet were hilarious: [my notes in orange]Use: 5 Rice bowl water (1 Lt) [this so reminds me of my mom, when I ask her how much, she says 2 hanfuls], 1 packet of Bah Kut Tea Spices, 12 pieces of garlic boiled [what's garlic boiled? I think they mean boiled garlic], add few drops of back soya sauce, put 600 gm (1 Kt) pork ribs and cook for 35 minutes.This packet of Bah Kut Tea Spices can be best used to cook with chicken, beef, mutton, pig liver, kidney, pigtail and any other intestinal organs of pig. It can also be used to cook best with all kinds of noodles. For best taste, do not over cook (about 35 mins to an hour), after the required cooking time, do not leave the packet of spices in the cooked soup. Of course, if you like the soup to be very hot and spicy then leave the packet of spices in the cooked soup for a longer time to suit your taste. If the soup is not salty enough, do not add any other sauces except a pinch of salt for better taste. [Does anyone else find this funny? Is that not the most \"if\"s you've seen in cooking directions?]Ingredients:Pepper, Salt, and Special Spices [this would not fly in the US]It's not really fair for me to pass judgment since I didn't have pork ribs, but there was something very familiar about it to me, a definite Asian flair, and very strong on the white pepper.

I think English must be the most difficult language to translate Asian Languages into.  It takes so much time to "Get" our colloquialisms.For instance, there is one of those new frozen yoghurt places in the strip mall near my work, I forget the main name of the place but beneath their name is a tag line that reads: "House of Beverage".  SRSLY?  Is the word for Refreshment, which is the only thing I can think of that would come close, the same as beverage?  I don't get it!  And then there is a diner on the corner called, "Casual Dining".  It is owned by a Japanese family, and it used to be a pretty cool sushi place.  It's like Cake Wrecks, only it's Marque Wrecks.  Sorry to ramble, but I thought you might get a kick out of it since you liked the packet instructions on the Soup Sachet.

Ciabatta
CONTENT
Ciabatta literally means \"slipper\". I personally don't think it looks like a slipper, but perhaps slippers in Italy used to look like that. In any case, it is one of my favorite breads. It's great eaten alone, dipped in olive oil, or made into a sandwich.I decided to tackle bread-making because Lon was on a strict diet of bread and rice for a few days. I figured, he should at least eat very fresh and delicious bread. I broke out \"The Bread Baker's Apprentice\" by Peter Reinhart, a book I've had for years and hadn't tried yet (not sure why). On the one hand, making Ciabatta has way many more steps then reasonable for someone who works daily. (We are quite spoiled by the no-knead bread.) On the other hand, the book gives such clear instruction, I was impressed, and am now motivated to try some other recipes.Here's some illustration of my labor of love:Peter Reinhart gives two options for Ciabatta, one made with a Poolish starter and one made with a Biga starter. He claims they are equally good so I chose Poolish because it's less work. It's just mixing ingredients together and letting it sit for a few hours, then refrigerating overnight.I did my best, nearly got a steam burn, and ended up with some very good Ciabatta.

I'm enjoying your site, and I plan on visiting often.I like how you include pictures with each step of this recipe.I've tried Reinhardt's recipe, and I didn't care for it.  It didn't yield the nice "holey" interior I like in a ciabatta.  I prefer Daniel Leader's recipe in Local Breads.  You might want to check it out.  Yesterday, I posted an adaptation of that recipe on my blog.thanks for sharing,muddywaters

Cranberry Cornbread
CONTENT
For Sheryl's holiday party, I had big plans, dreaming of making something extravagant, but alas, Lon and I got sick, and I spent most of yesterday on my couch. Today, I feel a lot better, so at least I'll get to go to the party, but now I had to settle for something much simpler to bring. Simple can still be dressed up, and the cranberries add that bit of red to make it more festive. I used the amount of cranberries I had handy, but feel free to add a bit more.Did you know cranberries looked like this inside? I sure didn't.On to the recipe...Cranberry Cornbread

Cheap Lobster
CONTENT
Recently we paid under $4 per pound for lobster (in Flushing). So, when I read in the New York Times that lobster prices have fallen about 25-30% year over year, I wasn't too surprised.The gist of the article, for those who aren't fans of the NY Times, is that lobster supply is better than normal, with record catches, and demand is way down, due to terrible economic conditions throughout North America. Both consumers and wholesale buyers are simply not buying.I did a bit of Googling, and turns out that NY Times is a bit late in the game on reporting this (big surprise -- I'm not a fan of them).As an aside, there are tons of other sources covering this news, most reputably the official trade rags and national agencies.

The picture reminded me of a prank some people did at my undergrad.  Once a year they would serve lobsters, and people would sometimes to try take an extra one to leave somewhere unexpected and freak people out.One year, security got a call the night after the lobster dinner that there was an illegal party going on in a campus lounge.  When they got there, they found lobsters set up playing Beirut, gambling etc.The vegetarian in me doesn't necessarily approve, but the rest of me has to admit it was a pretty funny prank!Hope you guys are feeling better! I'm just getting over food poisoning too - it's no fun, especially in the middle of finals :-/

When I was down by the Chinatown Soho border, a seafood distributor was practically giving them away.  Same goes on Route 18 in East Brunswick.  However, prices for Lobster in Ginger & Scallion Sauce, or any lobster dish in Chinese restaurants haven't budged.  Keep up the good work Lon and Jessica.To Tarin, if you're going to go Nikon, the D40 is just as good as D60 (save your money for  decent lens like our host-blogger are using).  Disclosure: I shoot a D40 with Sigma 30mm f/1.4 EX DC HSM.

Crack
CONTENT
What do you think of when you hear the word \"crack\"?Most will likely think butt crack.Some of you, who watch too many crime shows (like me) will think crack cocaine.But the test of a true foodie....is when you hear \"crack\" and you start to drool, and think of the crack of a lovely quickbread or pound cake.Is there a better part? As I was eating a slice of Butternut Squash Bread, I realized, I always save the \"crack\" for last, because I like saving the best for last (when I'm not worried about something hot getting cold). It's moist and a little bit sticky, and if I could, I would just eat that part of every pound cake, banana bread, or zucchini bread, I could get my hands on. It's kind of like the whole love of muffin tops. (Have you seen the episode on Seinfeld?) Should I start a store called \"Just Crack\"?

Quick Duck and Rice Cake Soup
CONTENT
Lon and I haven't been feeling too great. Lon has food poisoning (confirmed by a physician) and I might have the same in a minor way. Unfortunately, Lon is only allowed to eat rice, bread, and tea. I just wanted to eat light, and more importantly, I didn't want to spend a ton of time cooking.Thankfully, I have Salt Water Duck from last night, a ton of Swan Tsai (pickled mustard greens), and rice cakes. I always keep chicken broth on hand, so I had the perfect meal in minutes. The rice cakes need to be cooked separately, like most noodles. These came already cut in slices so all you have to do is boil it for 2 minutes. (Feel free to use other types of noodles or even rice.)I took a couple of pieces of the duck and pulled off all the fat (remember, the meal had to be light), threw it in a pot.

Asianesque Brussels Sprouts
CONTENT
Last night, we were having the Salt Water Duck, which set the theme as an Asian meal. I tormented over what to make as a vegetable side, knowing I wanted to use up the Brussels sprouts, but who's ever seen Brussels Sprouts in Chinese food? Could I make it work?Indeed! Not only did it pair well with the duck, it's now one of our favorite ways to have Brussels Sprouts.Asianesque Brussels Sprouts1. In a wok, stir bacon pieces around on medium low heat until fat starts pooling on the bottom and bacon starts to brown.2. Add brussels sprouts and stir until they are coated in fat. Add oyster sauce. Turn the heat up to high and stir.3. Add 1 tablespoon water and toss or stir until water evaporates. Add the next tablespoon water and toss or stir again. When it evaporates, add scallions and stir for a few seconds. Serve immediately.

This looks great! And brussel sprouts have a somewhat broccoli/cabbagey flavor so there's really no reason why they wouldnt work perfectly in asian cuisine.And for those who hate brussell sprouts: I used to hate them too, but thats because I had the classic overcooked, mushy, bitter brussell sprouts. Once my girlfriend bought some FRESH sprouts and cooked them just right so they were strill al dente with nice caramelization on the outside, it was a revelation. From then on  I loved them!

Salt Water Duck
CONTENT
My mom makes the most amazing Salt Water Duck. Like many traditional Chinese dishes, it's not that pretty, but when you try the texture of the meat, you will see why this unique cooking method has been past down for centuries. I don't know of any other method to create meat that has this kind of bounce and juiciness. The best part is, it's amazingly easy.Salt Water Duck1. Prepare the duck: Cut off excess fat. Cut off the tail. (My mom said this is essential because the tail will impart an off-tasting gaminess to the duck.)2. Cut open the chest cavity, from top to bottom so that the duck can lay open. Wash thoroughly. I keep the neck (tucked into the cavity) and discard the innards. Pat dry with a paper towel.3. Sprinkle a generous amount of salt all over the duck, inside and out. Sprinkle the neck lightly.4. Put the duck and neck in a tupperware container and store in your fridge overnight.5. Take the duck out of the fridge and rest on your counter. In a 8 quart pot, combine 4 quarts of water, 1/2 cup kosher salt, and ginger. Bring to a boil.6. Place duck and neck in the water and bring back to a boil. (The water should cover the duck. If it doesn't, add more water.) Allow to boil, uncovered for 5 minutes. Turn off the flame, cover, and allow to sit for 5 hours. Don't touch until it's done! I know you are thinking, is it really cooked through? That's what Lon asked and in disbelief, he saw that it was.7. Serve as soon as possible at room temperature. It's usually cut up with a cleaver but you can eat it any way you want. Store whatever you don't finish in the fridge and eat within a few days. The texture will be best the first day in room temperature, but still pretty good after.The neck is my favorite part.

We don't know how to cut up poultry the Chinese way... probably because our cleaver isn't very sharp. Afraid something bad is going to happen.I'm not too big a fan of well-done duck meat... but I'm thinking the saltwater method may have a different taste/texture than regular methods of cooking it?

Butternut Squash Bread
CONTENT
This Butternut Squash Bread is an adaptation of my favorite Pumpkin Bread recipe. The flavor of butternut squash is more mild, so it works for those (like Lon) who don't like pumpkin but I think I like the pumpkin version more. Still, this is an easy and light bread, making a good accompaniment to any breakfast.Butternut Squash Bread1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (325 degrees F with convection). Spray a 9×5 loaf pan with non-stick spray.2. In a large bowl, whisk together butternut squash, sugar, eggs, oil, and water.3. In a small bowl, combine flour, baking soda, salt, and spices.4. Bake for 55-60 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out clean. Cool on a rack till lukewarm before removing from the pan.5. After it cools completely, wrap in plastic wrap and it will keep in room temperature for a few days. It actually tastes better the next day.

thought you'd enjoy hearing - i accidentally left out the whole wheat flour so the recipe had far less flour then intended. of course, it looked very sad and deflated after it was baked  but it had the consistency of a souffle and was quite edible and delicious. interesting mistake to try sometime

Zaro's Bakery
CONTENT
After lunch at Deborah, my mom wanted to go somewhere to celebrate Grand Uncle Dalton's birthday. The catch is, my mom wanted to have a whole cake, not just a place with dessert. Bakeries with seating for 7 people are hard to find. We had thought of La Bergamote but they don't take reservations. They told us to call right before coming and check. We did and they said they couldn't seat us. Payard doesn't give reservations for just dessert. You have to eat a meal. Suddenly, Lon thought of Zaro's New York Bakery. The location at Broadway and 21st Zaro's New York Bakery has a pretty large seating area upstairs. It wouldn't be fancy, plastic forks and paper plates, coffee out of disposable cups, but what we were out of options.In the end, the cake was decent looking (except for the bad handwriting), but tasted pretty terrible. The yellow cake was very dry and the mocha cream tasted like mocha flavored vegetable shortening.

***Now Closed***When we walked in to Deborah Deborah and saw the very narrow space with a tiny open kitchen, I admit we got a little worried. This would be a tight squeeze for our group of 7 with winter coats. We had reservations but arrived a bit early. The staff quickly shifted tables to accommodate us and we were soon on our way to eating. Lon and I were impressed right away with how quickly food arrived and how we were all served at the same time. You'd be surprised at how few restaurants can do that for a party of 5 or more. Further, there were two requests to change a dish, which they did. Again, something restaurants seemingly have a problem with.I had the Smoked Salmon and Sauteed Spinach Benedict. The organic eggs were poached perfectly and the creme fraiche is a lighter, more refreshing option than Hollandaise. I would prefer a stiffer bread than Challah because it got too soggy by the end but, that's me being picky.The vegetables were fresh and this is certainly a dish for a garlic lover. So aromatic. (This picture really doesn't do this dish any justice.)

I love the name Pete's-A-Place Pete's-A-Place. It's hilarious.Delivery took about 30 minutes, which is ok, but everything was only slightly above room temperature so I had to take the time to reheat everything. We got a large pie (half plain, half sausage). Nothing special. It's average dough, average sauce, average cheese.The pepperoni roll was below average, possibly old?We did like Mama's Eggplant, one of their specialty pies. The eggplant is very tender and topped with a sweet sauce (different from the pizza sauce). While it's unique and we mostly enjoyed it, it does get a little too sweet by the end of the slice.

this looks excellent - make me hungry, turmeric strikes me as an odd choice on spice (like a totally European dish with a Thai curry component).  Also, did you  consider Pernod in the broth?

Lon

Asianmommy - Thanks!Bill - Thanks as well!  Pernod would not fit well as it's flavor is from star anise, which I think would go better with beef or lamb.  Yes, turmeric is a key ingredient in curry (not just Thai), and it's a wonderful spice.  It's nicknamed "the poor man's saffron" and sometimes I use it that way.  It lends beautiful color.  However, it tastes nothing like saffron; in fact, it's in the ginger family and you can really taste it.  It's like smokey ginger.  That's half of what imparts the "tangy" in the sauce (red pepper is the other half).

Quail Egg and Bacon Salad with Creamy Curry Dressing
CONTENT
I saw these quail eggs at the Chinese supermarket and they were so cute, I couldn't resist. You can treat them similarly to chicken eggs. Just adjust cooking time because they're much smaller. To hard-boil the quail eggs (without getting the green tinge), dunk them in boiling water for 3 minutes, rinse with cold water, then peel.As with most salad recipes, here are the ingredients, but no measurements, use the amounts you want: romaine lettuce, cherry tomatoes, crumbled cooked bacon, hard-boiled quail eggs.Creamy Curry Dressing3-4 servingsStir together ingredients. That's it.

I've always been taught to cook eggs starting in cold water and then bring them to a boil to decrease cracking and leaked egg-white; the shock of going from cold to boiling can break the egg shell.
Jessica@Foodmayhem
2008-12-07 16:11:00
Bill, I was taught both methods in culinary school and don't really have a preference (since I don't usually break my eggs either way) but for quail eggs, I think starting from cold may end up over-cooking.BTW, quail egg shell is very strong. I don't know if you can see the one that was a bit cracked in the picture but that didn't crack from boiling. It was already broken because I dropped it on the floor. It still stayed mostly in tact though.

Tori Shin
CONTENT
We recently met a friend, through a friend, whom we met through another friend, and quickly became friends. Le, our new friend, is in to food, taking culinary classes, and has tried most of the Japanese restaurants in the city. In his mind, Tori Shin Tori Shin is the go to place for yakitori, so we had to try it out.As usual, Lon likes to go for the Chef's Omakase, the full sha-bang. We started with lightly salted daikon and cucumber, fresh, crisp, and refreshing.The other was a very home-style dish of chicken and vegetables cooked in lightly sweetened soy sauce. Nothing special.Our first skewer was medium-rare chicken with dabs of wasabi. The chicken's rareness didn't make a striking difference to me; as opposed to beef where the difference between medium-rare and well-done is critical.The Gizzards were cooked perfectly, but under-seasoned and needed some acid.The liver was cooked as perfectly and again screamed for some acid.Ginko nuts, which I've never eaten before, are like popcorn-flavored dried soy beans. They tasted good, but again, were under-seasoned. By this point, Lon directly asked the chef for salt, which he gladly provided.The Chicken Rib was awesome. Think about the meat by the rib area, it's that extra chewy, bouncy meat. I really enjoyed the rib, but Lon found it too chewy.I was glad to get a break from chicken at this point. The okra was grilled expertly, the ginger was fresh, and the bonito added a nice smokiness. Yet I still felt like something was missing from this.Our favorite piece arrived next: the Chicken and Duck Meatball, served with a egg yolk to lather all over. The sweet soy sauce is caramelized nicely on the outside and the inside is soft and juicy.I had the Sake and White Wine Jello with strawberries and a rosemary garnish, a perfect dessert after such a big meal. It's light and you can do most of the eating with your eyes.

Bill, the chicken wasn't advertised as farm raised, free range, organic, or local, so I'd think they would say it were, right?Lesley, I've never actually bought Ginko nuts myself but I think health food stores probably carry them.Katherine, in this economy, I'm even more conservative.Wonders, I am wary of under-cooked chicken too as someone who food safety certified so I went out on the ledge to have the medium rare but I didn't try the chicken tataki.Everything was quite beautiful but I hope my photography skills are improving too.

I love my Kyocera knife. So, when I saw your post, I had to get the peeler. I happened to see it at Whole Foods for $10, so I just bought it there. I want to get the slicer next. Thanks for the great recommendation. I even got a set for Scott's mom for Christmas this year. Oh, if you want to get the Kyocera knife, get the Susan B Komen one. Part of the money goes to charity and its the same price as the regular one and has a pretty pink handle.

Cheddar Crust Apple Pie
CONTENT
I've seen a couple of recipes for apple pie with cheddar cheese in the crust, intending to try it out at some point. I finally got around to it and found this recipe that used a 9X13 oval baking dish. I happen to have one and have never seen a recipe using it. Boy, was I ecstatic!After reading the recipe more carefully, I realized a couple of problems. I didn't want the raisins in this recipe (no general prejudice against them) and I wanted a double crust pie, not just a top crust. Luckily, it seemed this recipe made more then enough dough for a double crust, and you'll still have left-over. (I'll try to do something with this another day.) Lastly, I like tall pies. (Have you heard of Mile High Apple Pie?) So, I increased the apple filling.Cheddar Crust Apple Pie~ adapted from this recipeCrustFilling*You'll need a 9X13 oval baking dish.For crust:1. Blend flour and salt in processor. Add shortening and butter and cut in using several on/off turns. Add cheese and pulse until it resemble small peas. With machine running, gradually blend in enough water until soft moist clumps form. Gather dough into ball; flatten into disk. Wrap in plastic and chill at least 2 hours and up to 2 days.For fruit:2. Mix apples, brown sugar, 1/3 cup sugar, flour, lemon juice and spices in large bowl. Let stand 30 minutes at room temperature.3. Preheat oven to 400°F. Remove dough from refrigerator and let stand 10 minutes. Split in half and roll out on a floured surface, a few inches larger than your dish. Place the bottom layer in and spoon fruit and any accumulated juices on top of the bottom crust.5. Bake pie 15 minutes. (You may want to place a tray beneath to catch drippings, just in case.) Brush crust with egg glaze. Top with 1 teaspoon sugar. Reduce oven temperature to 375°F. Bake pastry until golden, about 25 minutes. Cool on rack 15 minutes. Serve warm.We absolutely loved the taste, the filling, the crust, the balance of the two. And, it's gorgeous! The only problem is that there's a bit too much liquid. I would make this again with a bit more flour and ditching the liquid (from when you let the apple mixture rest for 20 minutes). Even so, the two of us ate half the pie already, yikes!Lon decided to have his a la mode.

2008-12-08 19:45:00
The only things I know for sure are that at high altitude bread rises faster and water boils at lower temp, so most things have to be cooked a little longer than you're used to. I'm still figuring things out about it, though! I've been pulling out flattened baked goods left and right.

Vietnamese-ish Sandwich
CONTENT
Yesterday, I saw some grilled pork loin in the fridge (it's great having a chef wife) and got a hankering for a Vietnamese Sandwich. So as a second lunch today (the first was leftover Oxtail Soup) I started slicing.I julienned carrots and green cabbage, dumping them, along with some chiffonade of cilantro and scallion, into a bowl. I added sugar, kosher salt, black pepper, vinegar, and water to cover the veggies. I left it for about an hour.Afterward, I drained the liquid out of the veggies. Then french cut the pork, adding it along with some mayo, hot sauce, and extra virgin olive oil to the veg -- tossing the whole thing together. That sat while I toasted a ciabatta roll.The resulting sandwich was beautiful and delicious. Next time I think I may add more vinegar.

Philly Mac & Cheese Steak
CONTENT
We still had some thinly sliced beef from hot pot, and it's perfect for Philly Cheese Steaks. I wanted to take it up a notch and it makes perfect sense to me to use Mac & Cheese rather than just cheese.Make the Mac & Cheese first (I used Monterey, Colby, and Cheddar because that's what we have on hand) because the really thin beef cooks instantly. Set it aside, then make the Philly Cheese Steak as always. (For me, caramelized onions are a must.)

A week or two ago, Sheng made a comment that may forever change my life. In case you missed it:Click here for the link.Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! I want to confirm that this does work! Adding just a pinch of salt in the coffee grinds, when you brew a whole pot, really improves coffee. As Sheng mentioned, it cuts the bitterness, but I feel like it also helps you taste the aroma, if you know what I mean.Anyways, try it!

Hot Pot
CONTENT
Hot Pot is one of my favorite winter meals. It's great for groups and potlucks, or great for anyone who doesn't know how to cook or just doesn't have the time. Here's what you need:1. A Hot Pot: these are usually electric and need to be plugged in. They keep the liquid hot throughout the meal. You can get ones that have different heat settings. This one also has a divider in the middle so you can have two different liquids to cook in.3. No Work Ingredients:a. Buy sliced meats, any kind you want, beef, chicken, pork, lamb, etc. The ones made for hot pot are sliced ultra thin and are usually more fatty. (Picture is beef left, pork right.)a. Enoki Mushrooms, Beech Mushrooms, Corn, and Chinese Cabbage just have to be cleaned and cut.

Pickled Mustard Greens
CONTENT
Pickled Mustard Greens, or Swan Tsai, are a traditional Chinese favorite. They're the sour chopped veggies you get in the Beef Noodle Soup (if you get an authentic one) or in Taiwanese dishes like Minced Pork Rice or Pork Chop Rice. Oh, I also love when they are sauteed with squid.So I asked my mom how to make Swan Tsai, and was shocked to learn how easy it was:1. Get a large clean jar (with lid). Clean the mustard greens very thoroughly by rinsing with water and rubbing the dirt off with your fingers.2. Press a few leaves into the jar, sprinkle with table salt, press another couple of leaves, sprinkle with table salt. Repeat until you reach the top, making sure to pack in tightly. Fill the jar with water and top with about a tablespoon of white vinegar. This is just to prevent mold. Cover tightly.3. Bring it over to the sink and turn it upside down 2 or 3 times.4. Now just let it sit. In warm weather, it will only take a few days. In the winter, it will take up to 9 days. It all depends on your room temperature.5.You have to check to see when it's done. After a few days, the bright green will turn to yellow and brown. If you look closely, you can still see some bright green. Wait until all of it turns brown. Now you can taste it by using a clean chopstick. Every time you open the jar, top with a spoon of vinegar before closing it. You can also add water if the water level has dropped. If the mustard greens don't taste like they are pickling by day 6, you probably didn't use enough salt. Add more and turn the jar upside down a few times.6. When it's done (to your taste), remove the leaves from the water and store in tupperware, in the fridge.*Note: Water can be re-used to pickle more mustard greens. Just pack in the leaves and sprinkle a little more salt and top with vinegar again.I LOVE Swan Tsai, sour and salty, crunchy and crispy, ok, they are an ugly color, but it's so so good! The anticipation while it's pickling is what kills me so start making more before you finish your stash.

CONTENT
Excellent Pork Chop House Excellent Pork Chop House is not a full-on Taiwanese restaurant but they do serve quite a few Taiwanese specialties. It's pretty ghetto, serving tea and water in Styrofoam cups, but at least there's an adequate amount of elbow room.Stick to Chicken Leg over Rice or Pork Chop over Rice, deep fried but not greasy, comes with Swan Tsai (pickled mustard greens) and minced pork, you can add the red cooked egg. These are classics I grew up with and I just need to eat it every once in a while. The places in Flushing are better but this will fill the craving.We also ordered Spicy Wontons and Stir Fried Rice Cakes but they very mediocre. Neither had too much flavor and the wontons were a bit watery.

Most Indian resturants tend to serve North Indian or Punjabi food. Pork is not a meat used here. Muslims, of course, don't eat meat and they too have influenced this cuisine. I think earlier only the lower caste Hindus would eat pok as pigs are used as scavengers in villages. Then there would be folks like me who are not as religiously conservative. Christians eat pork. Vindaloo is a Goan and East Indian dish (East Indians actually live in Western India!). pork is a favoured meat with them. I love Goan food

White Castle Virgin
CONTENT
This may be shocking but I had never eaten White Castle before. I know you are already laughing at me but in case your interested in this unique perspective...I just tried it for the first time yesterday. After eating a cheeseburger, 2 burgers, and a few sides, I have two major complaints and one pro. You want the pro first? It's not oily and greasy. That was a relief. I guess they steam them, which made my cheeseburger too soggy, but the other two burgers were ok (in that regard).The onion rings and clam strips aren't that good either, but at least they are a little crispy, the way fried things tend to be. Both were more like fried batter though, leaving out the onion or the clam.Yea, I'm not a fan of fast food to begin with but at the very least, I do like McDonald's and Burger King French Fries, and here you can't even get that. BTW, Lon loves White Castle.

Thanksgiving 2008 Series: Mini Pumpkin Pies
CONTENT
Both of us (Lon and I) don't like Pumpkin Pie. I know. I know. So anti-Thanksgiving but...it's the truth. One of my problems with pumpkin pie is that the filling is too much for me. Too what? I'm not sure, just too much, so I figured I might like it more if I made mini pumpkin pies so that I could work the ratio so that it's more crust, less filling. I think it worked. I do like this more and so does Lon. Yippee!Mini Pumpkin Pies ~24 mini piescrustfilling1. In a large bowl, use a wooden spoon to blend butter and cream cheese. Mix in half of the flour, then half of the remaining flour, with the wooden spoon. Knead in the remaining flour just until combined. Do not over work. Press into a 4×6 inch rectangle and wrap with plastic wrap. Refrigerate for at least 4 hours (up to 3 days).2. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (325 degrees F with convection) 20 minutes before you start cutting the dough.3. Cut the dough into 24 one inch cube pieces. Press each piece into the mini-muffin tin. Use your fingers to press it up the sides, trying to make as even as possible. Put it in the fridge while you mix the filling.4. Beat filling ingredients together. Divide filling into crusts. Bake for 5 minutes, rotate the pan, and lower the oven by 25 degrees. Continue baking for another 10 minutes or until the crust looks lightly golden and the filling doesn't move when you shake the pan.5. Cool completely before removing from the pans. They are soft and must be removed carefully. I use two pairing knives at opposite ends, to gently squeeze the mini pie in between and pick up.The Mini Pumpkin Pies and these Pecan Tassies (recipe in Carol Walter's, Great Cookies) are what we are bringing to Thanksgiving at Aunt Heather's. Minis are always great for traveling, but a lot more work. Well, it's family....

Oxtail Mushroom Soup
CONTENT
This soup has some of my favorite stuff, beef oxtails, sa cha sauce, and a plethora of mushrooms. Obviously, Lon was not home for dinner tonight. (Lon is slowly easing them into his diet though.) This big pot of soup will store well in the fridge and reheat well any time. It's comforting and diverse, good for any family. Serve with rice, noodles, rice cake (the Asian one, not the styrofoam stuff), or even bread.Oxtail Mushroom Soup1. Cut any large chunks of white fat (usually only on the large pieces)off the oxtails. 2. Put the oxtails, 8 cups of water, crushed tomatoes, and onions in a large pot. Throw in some salt and pepper. Cover and bring to a boil on hight heat. 3. Stir, reduce heat, and simmer uncovered for 45 minutes, stirring occasionally. Skim oil off the top with a spoon ( I got about 3/4 cup out). This will take about 10 minutes. 4. Stir in carrots and sa cha sauce and continue simmering for another 4o minutes, stirring occasionally. Add 4 cups of water and bring back to a boil. Bring down to a simmer and cook for another 30 minutes. Taste and adjust seasoning. 5. Stir in the mushrooms and simmer for another 10 minutes. Taste and adjust seasoning as necessary. Serve.

TITLE
Hahm Ji Bach
CONTENT
We've mentioned several times now that Chinese food is better in Queens (mostly Flushing) and that Chinatown in Manhattan is a real disappointment these days. We've been hearing the same from our Korean friends about Korean food. The restaurants in Queens and New Jersey are now favored over K-town (32nd Street between 5th and 6th avenues in Manhattan) for both quality and quantity/price.Last night, our friends, Angie and Scott, took us to Hahm Ji Bach (Bayside location)Hahm Ji Bach to witness the differences for ourselves. Right off the bat, there's at least 30% more panchan. Yet Angie complained that they must have cut back, not offering the steamed egg and whole fish panchan. Lon hovered over the tiny dried fish while I ate lots of bean sprouts. The kimchee was also nice, lighter than usual and rather refreshing. The rest was pretty standard.My favorite at Korean BBQ is always Galbi, marinated beef rib. The meat was extra moist. Good thing we got 2 orders.Of course, the regular accompaniments were given: lettuce to wrap it in, dressed scallion curls, thin slices of pickled radish, fermented bean paste, jalapeno and garlic.

Bacon Wrapped Chicken Sausage
CONTENT
I've mentioned Trader Joe's Sweet Apple Chicken Sausages before and for someone who hardly buys any pre-made food, I'm kind of embarrassed to be mentioning them again. But, this weekend, Lon decided to wrap some in bacon (we saw this all over Germany) and it was so darn good.

If you like Japanese Curry, that's what Curry-Ya Curry-Ya serves, and not much else. There is a pretty long list of options though: pork, chicken, veggie, hamburger, etc. and you get to choose the level of spiciness. I chose the Seafood Curry (hot), which comes with a large shrimp, 2 scallops, 2 pieces of calamari, a few string beans, and a strip of red pepper. All of it is cooked perfectly. (I'm quite impressed.)

Thanksgiving 2008 Series: Upside Down Cranberry Pumpkin Cake
CONTENT
Lon's not a big fan of pumpkin. I like pumpkin but I don't like pumpkin pie. So, for Thanksgiving, I had to come up with an alternative. This is a beautiful cake and perfect for those who don't like things too sweet. The light cake, mildly pumpkin flavored, is topped with tangy cranberries and crunchy pecans, a very adult cake (but I bet kids will like it too).Upside Down Cranberry Pumpkin Cake ~8-10 servingsToppingCake1. Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (300 degrees F with convection). Wrap the outside of a 9″ springform with aluminum foil. Spray the sides with non-stick. Place it on a try with an edge (just in case). 2. In a small saucepan, combine brown sugar and butter. Bring to a boil. Pour into the springform and sprinkle with cranberries and pecans.3. In a stand mixer, cream butter and sugar. Add eggs and beat well. 4. In a small bowl, combine the sour cream, pumpkin and vanilla; mix well. 5. In another small bowl, combine dry ingredients; add to creamed mixture alternately with sour cream mixture. Beat on low just until blended. Spread the batter on the cranberry mixture in the pan. Try to level it out. 6. Bake for 40 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. (Not that pretty this way, but just wait till you turn it over.)7. Cool for 10 minutes. Remove the side of the springform pan, Put a plate on top and turn it over. Remove the pan bottom and foil. Serve warm.

Butter Lane
CONTENT
I read about Butter Lane Butter Lane on the blog, Cupcakes Take the Cake. They have serious cupcake coverage. So, when they claim that the Banana Cake with Cream Cheese Frosting is one of the best cupcakes in NYC, I was certainly curious. I've almost given up on NYC cupcakes, finding I much prefer making my own (so they're not so sugary), but how could I resist possibly tasting \"the best\"?The funny thing is that they have a sign explaining the difference between French Buttercream and American Buttercream so I wanted to get some of both but they didn't have any French Buttercream available yet. (Sorry about the pic. It was a spontaneous decision to go and all we had was a camera phone.)I like that Butter Lane cupcakes are all natural, and they do taste fresh and natural, but only the Banana Cake with Cream Cheese Frosting is notable. At $2.50/$2.75 per cupcake, I don't think it's worth it, but that's because I can make them.

At the end of the article, it should either be:, "... but that's BECAUSE I can make them" or, to use a slang term "... but that's 'CUZ I can make them".  The use of the word "cause" is just completely wrong.  Even a blogger should have someone proof-read their posts.  It takes away from a rather direct and informative post.

A NYC Visitor's Guide to Thanksgiving Eating
CONTENT
My cousin Brian sent over an e-mail this week mentioning that a friend would be in NYC for the Thanksgiving Day Parade, and asked if we could recommend any good eats.I have a friend here at school who is going to be spending Thanksgiving in Manhattan, and she asked if I knew any places to get a good Thanksgiving dinner. Understandably the first people I thought to ask were you and Jessica. With all the political mumbo-jumbo being thrown around recently I think its fair say that I consider you two my to be my Secretaries of Comestibles, and you've earned it. My friend was didn't know exactly where they would be, but she said that they were going to the parade.First of all, I absolutely love our newly assigned titles of Secretaries of Comestibles. Secondly, how fun is it to think of places to eat! It's basically our hobby. I checked out the parade route and tried to think of a wide variety of places within a few blocks of the route. I didn't spend much energy on thinking of places that would feature turkey, but rather focused on NYC. And not knowing much about dietary or budgetary restrictions, I assembled a wide variety of selections.What places would you recommend (along the route)?Lon suggests:1. More upscale brunch/lunch, New American cuisine, etc: BLT Market (6th ave & 59th st)2. Classic NY Deli (will be a mob scene): Carnegie Deli (7th & 55th)3. NY Thin Crust Pizza: John's (44th St & 8th Ave)4. Decently cheap authentic Indian Food (I've been to the one on 31st, it's ugly inside, but delicious): Minar (31st & 5th or 46th & 6th).5. Super cheap authentic Puerto Rican Buffet (also ugly inside): International Food House (35th St & 7th)6. Pretty cheap, semi-authentic, very delicious Cuban: Sophie's (40th & 7th)7. Korean (famous for their tofu, but also good table bbq): Seoul Garden (32nd & Broadway)Jessica suggests:1. Reliable, simple American: Fred's (83rd & Amsterdam)2. Burgers and Shakes: Shake Shack (77th and Columbus)3. Italian with a long menu to satisfy everyone: Cafe Fiorello (Broadway & 63rd)4. Bakery/Pastry Shop. Try the Nutter Butter: Bouchon Bakery (Time Warner Center)Note: Try to eat on the Upper West Side. You're much more likely to fall into an over-priced and terrible tasting tourist trap in midtown.*FoodMayhem's advice for holiday eating: no matter where you plan on going, make sure to call ahead to ensure the place will be open on turkey day!

Thanksgiving 2008 Series: Bacon, Beets, and Brussels Sprouts
CONTENT
Ahh, the three B's: Bacon, Beets, and Brussels Sprouts, all stuff I love. Right now, brussels sprouts can be found in the farmer's market, on the stalk, a signal of freshness. I like smaller ones, around 1″ in diameter but the larger ones are just as good, but you do have to halve them to ensure even cooking.Bacon, Beets, and Brussels SproutsInstructions1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (375 degrees F with convection).2. Put the beets in a tupperware container with lid and microwave on high for 2 minutes. Remove from the microwave and let it rest for 2 minutes. Turn the beets over and re-cap the tupperware and microwave for another 2 minutes. Let it rest for 2 minutes and check that a small knife pierces easily. If it's done, just let it cool. If not, microwave for another minute.2. While beets are cooling, bring salted water to a boil in a 4 quart pot. Boil brussels sprouts for 4 minutes. Drain and rinse with cold water. Set aside.3. Peel beets and dice.4. Heat bacon in a large cast iron pan over medium high heat and stir around for about 2 minutes. Add brussels sprouts and beets. Season to taste and stir for the fat to coat, about 2 minutes, then place in the oven for 5-7 minutes, or until browned nicely. Serve immediately.

Raspberry Lemon Tarts
CONTENT
This recipe is an adaptation of Blueberry Lemon Cream Tarts (from epicurious.com) and we really love them. The one downside is that the crusts are really crumbly and two out of four almost fell apart. I'm guessing that using organic graham crackers exacerbated the problem. I actually like the texture of the crumbly crust though, while Lon doesn't. For me, it achieves a lightness and elegance. We both agree that ultimately, it's a REALLY easy tart recipe that will impress your guests.Raspberry Lemon Tarts~4 tarts* You will need 4 (4″) nonstick fluted tart pans.Instructions2. Stir together graham cracker crumbs, butter, and granulated sugar in a bowl with a fork until combined well, then press mixture with your fingers and back of a spoon evenly and firmly onto bottom and up side of each tart pan.3. Put tart pans on preheated baking sheet and bake crusts until slightly darker, about 10 minutes, then cool 10 minutes on a rack. Remove to serving plates very carefully.4. While crusts cool, whisk together sour cream, brown sugar, and vanilla in a small bowl until sugar is dissolved. Beat cream cheese in a medium bowl with an electric mixer until smooth, then add sour cream mixture and zest, beating until just combined well.5. You can either spoon cream cheese filling among tart shells or pipe it in. Top with raspberries and dust with confectioners sugar.

Lobster Stock

When lobster is $3.88 per pound, you buy it; especially in New York City. So I wasn't surprised when Jessica and her mom came home with three 1.2 lb lobsters. We were all pleased with how fresh and flavorful they were. As we tore the shells off, we were careful to collect all the of the pieces for stock. Where others may see a garbage pile of shells, we see luxurious stock waiting to happen.I love making stocks. No careful chopping or measuring -- just throw everything in a pot with water and come back every hour or so to say \"hi.\" Here's a quick and dirty \"recipe\" (I didn't measure anything) for lobster stock. Over the next few days you'll likely see a few lobster stock related recipes on FoodMayhemLobster Stock General Instructions

Cornmeal Crusted Bay Scallops
CONTENT
I got a bag of frozen bay scallops at Trader Joe's and they were quite large for bay scallops. The first half of the bag was sauteed and thrown in a pasta, which was ok, but we really hit a home run frying the rest. They're bite size and fun to pop in your mouth. My mom practically jumped up and down about these.Cornmeal Crusted Bay Scallops~3 to 4 appetizer size portionsInstructions1. Heat the oil to 350 degrees F.2. Drain scallops and toss with potato starch until all pieces are coated. Season with salt and pepper.3. Beat egg in a small bowl. Set aside. Combine cornmeal, ancho, garlic, and parsley in a another small bowl.4. Dip scallops in egg mixture. Let excess drip off and toss with cornmeal mixture. Shake off excess and fry (in batches, depending on the size of your pot). Scallops are done when they float, about 1 minute. Season with salt to taste and drain on paper towels. Eat immediately.

Ajisen Ramen
CONTENT
I was about to take a picture at Ajisen Ramen (Flushing location) Ajisen Ramen when my camera battery died. Oh well, no loss. The ramen isn't that good. My mom wanted to show me the new modern building in Flushing, Queens Crossing. There are a few restaurants and shops on the ground floor and several floors of offices on top.My mom had the Spicy Miso Ramen; I had the Ajisen Deluxe; each under $8. The noodles are like thin spaghetti. The soup is rather boring. None of it tastes Japanese and they aren't really worth describing. On the one hand, it's hard to complain when it's pretty inexpensive. On the other hand, you're in the heart of Flushing where great food is everywhere at the same price. So yea, if you are in Flushing, do not waste your time here.

It's already lightly sweetened (by syrup, unfortunately) so it doesn't need much.Strawberry Dressing~2 servingsJust whisk all ingredient together!For salads, you know I hate writing amounts cause it's really flexible:This simple salad is a really pretty bright red and green. It's a good one to keep in mind for Christmas. Don't forget to make more though. This recipe is just for two.

Gimme Coffee and a bit more...
CONTENT
For those who have been reading for a while, you know I'm mildly obsessed with finding good coffee, which is no easy feet in NYC. I recently read an article in the NY Times, where Oliver Schwaner-Albright writes:\"A friend returned recently from San Francisco and raved about the coffee. But then he said the cappuccino at Gimme! on Mott Street in Manhattan is every bit as good.I strongly feel that the West Coast wins when it comes to coffee. It not only has great roasters, cafes and baristas, it has a sophisticated coffee culture, where patrons know what they’re drinking and won’t accept an inferior drink no more than they would buy stale bread. New Yorkers are sadly lacking those standards. Not only will a New York cafe charge $2 for a burnt espresso in a paper cup, a New Yorker will pay for it, drink it and come back the next day.But at my friend’s urging I went to Gimme!, and was duly impressed. The $3 cappuccino (organic milk is 50¢ extra), was delicious, but even more telling was when the barista apologized for taking so long: she didn’t like how the first shot came out so she threw it away and made a second. It was one of the few times I’ve seen a New York cafe strive for excellence.Was it as exceptional as what I’ve had in California? Not quite. But it was awfully good, and now ranks among my three favorite cappuccinos in Manhattan.\"Seeing as how I agree with most of what Oliver said (I too had my favorite cup of coffee in SF at Philz Coffee), I went to try Gimme Coffee Gimme Coffee, although my focus was more coffee than cappuccino. The coffee (their Platinum Blonde) was good, not great, but I drank the whole medium sized cup instead of throwing it out, which is saying something.Like this article, I find many tauting the favorite spots for cappuccinos and/or espressos but what about just a good cup of coffee? So, I plead to New Yorkers; I'm a native, myself. I welcome any suggestions, preferably in NYC and accessible by subway. More importantly, I beg beg beg of you to stop forking over $2 or more for bad coffee. Don't accept mediocrity, brunt and acidic stuff, left out for too long. We need to take a stand or we'll never get the good stuff.

It's a little out of the way, but last time I out there I stayed with a friend in Brooklyn and actually found really decent coffee at a place called Gorilla Coffee. They roast the beans on the premises, and on all three occasions there wasn't any bitterness to the beans.If you make your coffee at home, Dancing Goats (based out of my current state of WA) has some awesome coffee that used to be served somewhere in NYC, but alas, high shipping prices took their toll. You can still order it online, but I imagine you're just looking for a decent already brewed coffee.

Thanksgiving 2008 Series: Roasted Butternut Squash
CONTENT
I spent a lot of time trying to think up a fancy butternut squash recipe. After much too much thought, I realized, my favorite way to have butternut squash is just simply roasted. It's almost too good to be true, but with little adornment, it's perfect just the way it is.Preheat your oven to 400 degrees F (375 degrees F with convection) and line a sheet pan with aluminum foil. Peel, seed, and slice the butternut squash 1/4″-1/2″ thick. Spread them across the pan and drizzle with olive oil and/or melted butter. Squeeze some fresh lemon juice on top. Sprinkle with salt and pepper and bake for 20 minutes. Toss the butternut squash and continue baking for another 10 minutes. If the slices are 1/4″ thick, it may be done. If you sliced thicker, continue baking for another 10-20 minutes, until fork tender and browned nicely.

Pork and Shrimp Lettuce Wraps
CONTENT
I've been seeing Lettuce Wraps grow in popularity at Chinese restaurants, now often served as a dish at banquets. We had a Clam filled Lettuce Wrap at our rehearsal dinner and a Shrimp and Pork filled one at Peking Duck Forest. The filling ideas are endless but based on what we had at home, I made this one. We both loved it.Pork and Shrimp Lettuce Wraps~makes 6-8 wraps1. In a small bowl, mix together pork, soy sauce, corn starch. Set aside.2. Heat the oil in a small wok on high, swirling around to coat the sides. Add onions and carrots and stir around for 30 seconds.2. Add pork mixture and stir around breaking up the clumps until meat is brown, 1-2 minutes. Add shrimp and sa cha sauce. Stir around until shrimp turns opaque, 1-2 minutes. Stir in apples, heating for another 30 seconds.3. Serve immediately on lettuce leaves.The non-traditional touch here is the chopped apple, but to me, it's now essential. Some restaurants use water chestnuts, which I hate. Apple gives that little crunch, but a better flavor, a light sweetness, with a little tartness.

Sushi Yasuda #25

Sushi Yasuda is still keeping us on our toes, with two new pieces this time.The Yari Squid is actually the same species as the one they always have, but right now they have one from Japan. The texture is a lot creamier, melting in your mouth, literally coating your tongue. The flavor is the same.We've also had Wild Salmon Roe before, but this one was from the Chum Salmon. Each egg is a little bigger and lighter in color than the one from the King Salmon. The flavor is mild and smooth, but my favorite part is that each one needs to be intentionally popped. They are a bit stronger than usual so when you press down, you really feel the burst. Yum!

Thanksgiving 2008 Series: Cranberry Cabbage Slaw
CONTENT
Some people love Cole Slaw and some people hate it. I used to hate it as a kid because the ones I had tried were overly dressed and soggy, like cabbage sitting in mayo soup. I didn't have a good one till some time during college but now I'm a fan, well sometimes. If your family like slaws, this one has a Thanksgiving touch to them, dried cranberries. It's easy to make. You can (well, have to) make ahead, and it's an easy dish to pack and bring to someone else's home. Enjoy!Cranberry Cabbage Slaw~serves 6DressingSlaw1. In a small bowl, whisk together the dressing ingredients. Set aside.2. Put cabbage, craisins, carrot, and onion in a container (7 cup capacity) with lid. Add dressing, cover, and shake vigorously. Store in refrigerator over night.

White vs. Black Pepper
CONTENT
AskRedditFood: Does anyone find they prefer white over black pepper or vice versa?Perhaps it helps to consider an analogy of red vs. green bell pepper. They are the same exact item, in different stages of ripeness. And although they are the same berry (peppers are in the berry family), they taste quite different. The chlorophyll still in the pepper (making it green) gives a slight bitter taste. Many other chemicals change during ripening as well, including acid and cellulose levels. The result is a slightly softer (texture) and sweeter (flavor) item.The next question is whether you would use one in place of the other... and the answer is: sometimes, but typically not. Green bell pepper is a critical flavor component of many creole dishes, in which a red bell pepper has no place (just too sweet). And red bell pepper is often roasted to enhance it's natural sweetness, something which doesn't work as well with green bell peppers. They each have their own charm and use.Back to the other berry (peppercorns are berries), which I consider in the same way as their big brothers, the bell pepper. Black peppercorns are the under ripe berry that is slightly cooked (both in water and then in the sun) until the skin turns black. When the berry ripens completely it is skinned and dried. So, actually, this is where the analogy ends. White peppercorns are just the seed of the berry, while black peppercorns are the whole berry. While at this stage, it's worth mentioning green peppercorns. Green is almost identical to black, but not cooked in the sun, rather it is brined, which maintains and enhances the natural green color.So how do they differ? Well, different people debate the \"spice\" of each color pepper, the truth is they are identical and the other flavors are affecting peoples tastes. The skin contains chemicals which taste strong, often this is what people consider to be the true pepper flavor. Meanwhile the less intense white pepper actually has the same flavor that is just less intense.In terms of uses, white pepper is often used in French cooking for white sauces, such as bechamel, in order to avoid seeing black specks. Also the creamy sauce doesn't need such a strong pepper taste. Green pepper has use in French cooking as well, specifically when making the wonderful dish: Steak au Poivre, which features crushed green peppercorns. Black pepper is the default pepper though in most French cooking.In Asian cuisines, the default pepper is typically the green or white peppercorns, although black has been used for thousands of years in China. And in some provinces of the mainland you won't find any of these, but rather an unrelated version: Szechuan pepper, which is MUCH spicier. When I visited Thailand I saw only green and white pepper on tables.In the US most people rely on black pepper for their dishes, it is definitely the default. And when I cook, I use it 95% of the time. I consider it almost as critical as Salt... which has many variants as well, but that's for another time

Thanks Hillary -- Pink peppercorns, as you might already know, are not actually pepper at all, but are berries nonetheless.  They grow in tropical climates and are typically imported via France.  In fact, there has been debate about how wise it is to eat them (check out this NY Times article from 1982, likely because other parts of the Baies rose plant are toxic to pigs and cows and possibly small children).Anyway, the result of their rarity in the US has made them expensive and often brined, reducing the natural flavor.  I've heard it's hard to find good pink peppercorns in the US.  I would suggest buying from Penzey's (~ $8/oz).  I haven't had their pink pepper, but we love their other spices.Anyway, because pink pepper is much cheaper and more available in France, it is more often found in French cuisine.  Pink pepper has subtler, less spicey, and more complex flavor than white/black/green pepper.  Supposedly it has more fruit and anise flavors, although I haven't noticed that myself (probably for not having access to good quality pink pepper).Because of pink's flavor, it pairs well with lighter-flavored food, where true pepper might be over-powering.  That means: white-fleshed fish, baby chicken, pork loin & chops, and even various desserts (fruit and ice cream).I once had white pepper ice cream, where the pepper was too strong, now I wish I had it with pink pepper.Hope this helps!

Top Chef Run Down
CONTENT
Last season we waited until Episode 7 of Top Chef before we made any commentary. However, we enjoy the show, despite it's numerous flaws. Several of the chefs have gone on to interesting careers including Hung and Harold. This year, Kasi recommended us posting some predictions and early thoughts.After only the first episode, there are certainly some forerunners in the Top Chef race and some obvious losers showing up. Check out lots of clips on Hulu.Obviously, I have no way to know what will happen, but it's fun to guess. Astute fans will notice that I enumerated 14 episodes, but it's likely the season will only be 12 or 13 episodes long. That indicates that we will probably see two people go on a single episode in the future.

I just was looking back at this (it's amazing the things I come up with to procrastinate when I should be working on final papers), and I just wanted to point out that you seem to have overestimated the men and underestimated the women, who generally seem to be holding up pretty well, for now at least.
Lon
2008-12-13 09:11:00
Em - In pure numbers you're right.  However, in a more subjective examination, I think my guesses for the women were pretty good.  As one example, Ariane, who is still on, was in the bottom twice out of the gate, and in the last episode she won for... cooking lamb correctly!  I don't exactly consider the ability to cook meat to the right temperature a sufficient skill to qualify as "top chef".  Plus, Jess and I were disappointed that no one mentioned that it was Radhika who made the marinade.I will say that Radhika seems to be the one woman who I particularly underestimated, but I really think she's hiding in the weeds right now.  She'll be eliminated soon enough.

Brunch at Cafe Brama
CONTENT
We've talked about Cafe Brama before, a place where I have enjoyed smoothies, dessert crepes, and cappuccinos. This was our first visit for a meal and I really really wanted to love it, but I left severely disappointed. We were with our friends, Steve and Yael, and now I'm embarrassed that we recommended this place. The experience had totally changed. The service was so confused. I think Yael had to ask for milk three times as her coffee sat their cooling.At first, I was happy that each brunch order came with a choice of juice and a coffee/tea or capuccino (+$1). I know they use Looza for their juice, which we love, but Yael and I both ordered mango which tasted like some soap got dropped in it. We asked for a replacement but it still had the same problem. As for the capuccino, formerly my favorite, it was brought out luke warm and I ended up leaving more than half of it.The staff, although nice, seemed rushed and unable to handle the almost full restaurant. Apparently the kitchen was so rushed, they didn't cut the rinds off the cheese in Lon's Country Ham Sandwich. Lon also had to ask about the home fries, listed as part of his plate on the menu. The waitress had to check the menu and then go get him the home fries.

This morning I smelled some bacon cooking down the hall and knew I had to have a savory breakfast. However, our fridge just wasn't complying with me, there was not much to work with except two big containers of strawberries; but as I said, my heart was set on savory. Down to the freezer I went, where I saw our bag of amazing, frozen shrimp -- bingo.Curry Shrimp Scrambled Eggs~serves 2IngredientsInstructions

MSN Health is running an interesting article listing the Top-20 Most Unhealthy Drinks. Starting out the list includes Vitamin Water as the \"Worst Healthy Drink\" and Sunkist as \"Worst Soda\". Later in the list includes a Jamba Juice drink with over 1,110 calories.Topping the list is a drink with over 2,300 calories. Wow! I won't spoil the surprise about which drink it is, but I will mention that it has 73 disgusting ingredients and 66 teaspoons of sugar.

Chicken Stuffed Carnival Squash
CONTENT
With all the different squashes in the farmer's market, it's a bit overwhelming. But fear not, just try them. It's fun. Carnival Squash is not one I'm familiar with but I dared to write a recipe for it anyway. (If it doesn't work-out, you'll never see this.)For some reason, I'm very dissatisfied with the idea of just roasting or steaming all the different variety of squashes with some butter. We need more, MORE! (insert maniacal laugh here) So, here's my thought process: stuffed potatoes, yum, how about I stuff the Carnival Squash? Ok, totally not the same thing but go easy on me, I'm revealing my inner thoughts here. Yes, my inner thoughts are still only about food. Not much else goes on up there.Chicken Stuffed Carnival Squash~serves 21. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (350 degrees F with convection) and wash the squash thoroughly.2. Cut the squash in half and scoop out the seeds. Place cut side down in a dish and fill with 1/2″ of water. Bake for 30 minutes. While it's baking, hand shred the chicken. Set aside.3. Remove from the oven and flip over. Put 1/2 tablespoon of butter in each squash half and sprinkle with brown sugar. Bake for another 15 minutes. Set each squash half (open side up) on a plate.4. Heat a small saute pan with olive oil. Add onions and garlic and stir around until softened. Add chicken, chili powder, and cumin. Season to taste. Divide in half and fill each squash half. Serve.I love the presentation of this dish. The skin of the carnival squash in beautiful and makes a natural bowl. Lon likes how this dish looks like a cornucopia. The squash itself has an interesting texture, almost like spaghetti squash, but the strands are not as defined. It's very sweet and works wonderfully with chili chicken.

Thanksgiving 2008 Series: Pumpkin Lasagna
CONTENT
As I mentioned, I'll be working on recipes for you to use this Thanksgiving. This one is not one of your grandma's recipes. It may seem a little out there and I won't lie, I was nervous making it, thinking, what if this is crap? I don't know where this idea even came from. Ideas just pop into my head from time to time, but just trust me. This is an incredible recipe. Lon was skeptical too, as he asked, what is that? Oh, and pumpkin, forget it. He was like, don't give me a big piece. But in the end, he loved it.Pumpkin Lasagna~4 main course servings or 6-8 sides1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (350 degrees F with convection).2. Shred 8 ounces of mozzarella and mix with ricotta. Set aside.3. In a non-stick saucepan, melt butter on low heat. Add garlic and brown lightly. Stir in pumpkin, honey, cinnamon, and nutmeg, and heat until warm. Remove from heat.4. Spray a 8×8 glass dish with non-stick spray and smear a thin layer of pumpkin mix on the bottom.5, Lay down two lasagna sheets side by side. Spread 1/4 of the mozzarella/ricotta mixture on top. Spread 1/4 of the pumpkin mixture on top. Repeat 3 more times.6. Slice the remaining mozzarella and lay on top. Cover with aluminum foil and bake for 35 minutes. Remove the aluminum foil and bake for another 5 minutes. Remove from the oven and let it rest for 5 minutes before serving.

Tamarind
CONTENT
We met up with Shruti and Ekta for lunch at Tamarind Tamarind, mainly because it's close to Lon's office. He's gone a few times and says it's hit or miss, but we agreed this visit was closer to the hit side. Their food in enjoyable, mostly because the meats and fishes are very tender, often marinated in yogurt. The flavors are pretty standard though and all the choices are rather similar. So, I guess I'm saying, it's enjoyable once, but would get boring if I went again.I started with the Salmon Tikka (Nizami Machli Tikka), which was really perfectly cooked, tender and juicy, yes, marinated in yogurt.'Lunch is $24 for 3 courses, with Naan and a Potato side, in a nice dining space, lined with some tables/booths that feel more private. It could be a good choice for a business lunch, but like most Indian food, you'll need to schedule a nap afterward.

Dinner. What do you think I have to try? Or better question, what do you think I should have Scott order? He had Indian food once and didn't like it. I was going to have him stick with maybe salmon or chicken tikka since I think its the heavy spices he's not fond of. I know what you are thinking, how can someone not like Indian food. Its so delicious. That's why I'm trying to ease him in. I'm pretty sure he'll like naan though.

Angie, I'm sure their dinner menu has a lot more options but Tamarind seems a little toned down compared to most Indian places so I think it'll be ok. Tikka is probably a good choice for Scott or maybe Tandoor chicken.Grace, now you can use it on your own food.

Thanksgiving is Coming!
CONTENT
Ok, I'm going to start working on recipes that you can use for Thanksgiving. One of my favorites, tried and true, is this Pumpkin Roll recipe. It's simple and is great to make ahead, even a week ahead.Just yesterday, I made it using fresh pumpkin puree vs. canned pumpkin puree and was wowed by the difference. I thought the flavor would be different (the fresh is milder) but didn't think the difference in texture would be so dramatic. The canned pumpkin puree yields a more cake-like texture, while the fresh pumpkin gives you a much denser, more bread pudding like texture. Lon, who's not the biggest pumpkin fan, really liked this version (fresh pumpkin).We brought it over to my brother's apartment for our friend, Janny's birthday party, where my brother also prepared strawberries. Lon decided to hollow it out and put some of the cream cheese frosting (from the pumpkin roll) in. Needless to say, the inside out cheesecake, was divine.

Five of us, Alex, Tammy, Tim, Lon, and I, met at A La Turka A La Turka for some long overdue catching up. Immediately, Lon and Alex were happy about the giant water goblets. I was happy about having a decent amount of light and table space. You'd be surprised how hard it is to find these days.We started with the Mixed Appetizer Plate, which looks eerily similar to the one at Ali Baba. The Cacik was my favorite, thick and tangy. It seemed stronger than most. The hummus was a bit dry, the White Bean Salad standard. There was two made of eggplant. One was nice and smokey, the other flavored in tomato sauce (Soslu Patlican). The Acili Ezme was great but I wished for a tad more spice. For some reason, I can't remember the Spinach tarator.Of course, all this needs to be eaten with bread. The first one brought out was dry and cold. The next two or three were warm, softer, and therefore better.

This soup contains onions, sausage, scallion, carrot, parsnip, canned plum tomatoes with liquid, white wine, and chicken broth. The result was hearty, healthy, and the perfect thing for this weather.

Rachel and Brandon met us for dinner at La Sirene La Sirene on Sunday night. The little BYOB Bistro didn't look all that appealing and the bench seats against the wall were uncomfortable. The menu did appeal to me, seeing some classics with some less common dishes mixed in, but they were out of the Hanger Steak and the Cassoulet, two of their most popular items.I started with the Moules Rochelaises, steamed mussels with curry, apples, and light cream. The mussels were fresh and the sauce tastes just as described, wonderful for dipping bread in.The Big Profiteroles au Bittersweet Chocolate was very good. Vanilla ice cream sandwiched in choux pastry, drenched in Callebaut chocolate. It hit the spot for me, rich and decadent, without being too sweet.

CONTENT
When you need to by pre-packed mozzarella, Belgiosioso Fresh Mozzarella is the best one I've had. It's actually good enough to eat fresh (without melting it). It's soft and pretty milky, lightly salted already. It's still not as good as the fresh ones, eaten the day it's made, like the one I just got at Di Palo's, but good. So now you are probably asking, if it's not as good, why buy it? Well, it lasts a lot longer, several weeks (depending on expiration date) as opposed to a few days, and it's a bit cheaper at about $10 for 2 pounds (at BJ's). So for certain uses, this is a good choice.

Brunch at August
CONTENT
Sara and I met up for brunch at August August, a cute little place with a big powerful wood oven. Naturally, we wanted the Wood Oven Baked Eggs En Cocotte, but needed help deciding between 4 flavors. Our waiter recommended Alsatian: bacon, onions, and creme fraiche, which I loved. The caramelized onions were so sweet, the bacon was in nice thick chunks, and the runny egg was perfect for slathering all over the buttered bread. Next time, I'm trying the Andalusian: chorizo and blistered peppers.

Matcha Green Tea Cupcakes
CONTENT
I wanted to make birthday cupcakes for two friends, Sara and Rachel, and I couldn't decide on regular sized cupcakes or miniatures. Turns out, things worked themselves out, two people meant I could do both. I must be on a lucky streak because this recipe also turned out to be perfectly one tray of regular sized and one tray of miniature sized. Oh, and absolutely delicious too!Matcha Green Tea Cupcakes~makes 12 regular sized cupcake + 24 miniature cupcakesFrosting1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (325 degrees F with convection). Place muffin liners in a mini muffin tin and a regular muffin tin.2. In a medium-sized bowl, sift together all purpose flour, cake flour, matcha powder, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.3. In a large bowl, beat together sugar, oil, eggs, and vanilla.4. Alternating between dry mix and sour cream, stir into the wet mixture until just combined. Cool looking batter huh?5. Fill mini muffin cups so that the tin looks about 2/3 full. If you're paper looks short in height like mine, the papers will look almost full.6. Bake mini muffins for 10 minutes, or until toothpick comes out clean. Remove and let it cool for 10 minutes before removing to a cooling rack.7. While mini cupcakes bake, fill regular sized tin a little more than 2/3 full. Bake for 15 minutes, or until toothpick comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes before removing to a cooling rack. Cool cupcakes completely before frosting.8. To make frosting, sift together confectioner's sugar and matcha powder. Set aside. Using a heavy duty mixer with the paddle attachment, beat together cream cheese, butter, and vanilla on medium speed for 5 minutes. Reduce the speed to low and add sugar/matcha gradually. Once all of the sugar/matcha is mixed in, increase speed to medium and beat for 5 minutes more. Frost with piping bag.I always save deli containers so that I can pack treats:

Turkish Delights
CONTENT
My parents just got back from a trip around the Mediterranean and brought some treats back from Turkey. They brought dates, vacuum sealed so they were still very fresh, that were so so sweet. I can't wait to have some more paired with cheese later.The other one was sweeter and fruitier, closer to maybe a pate de fruits, but not quite as strong, or as good in my opinion.

its quite a coincidence that your folks went to Turkey as well. I am sure they would have loved it. Even I prefer the pistachio ones.

BCD Tofu House
CONTENT
BCD Tofu House BCD Tofu House, a chain from California, has opened a place in NYC, in K-town. I did eat at one in LA but that was about 15 years ago so I really don't remember much. I had high hopes though, which were soon brought down a notch.Starting with the panchan, they didn't look all that exciting. The kimchee was decent, the kind that leans towards more sweet. The bean sprouts looked like they've been sitting around a while and for the first time, no one asked for more panchan. (Most aren't even worth describing.)Overall, it's ok. Considering the price of $24 per person (including tax and tip), I can't complain too much, but I won't be going again either.

Last time, Lon went to Sushi Yasuda without me. Don't worry. That won't happen again.Super quick: two new pieces this time, Swordfish and Aori Squid. Swordfish was so unlike what I expected. When cooked, it is considered a firm and meaty fish. As sushi, it is so tender and the flavor was like a mild Spanish mackerel.

Maple Pecan Sticky Buns
CONTENT
For Carol's election party, the theme was comfort food. After about 3 days of thought, I decided to make Maple Pecan Sticky Buns (found on epicurious.com). Now, these are pretty work intensive (and there's a huge clean-up) so take a look at this process before you decide to make these.First, you make a dough, one with quite a bit of ingredients.Then you make a syrup, pour it in the pans, and drizzle with chopped nuts.Then, there's the filling. You need to break out the food processor, which also means cleaning it.The dough needs to be rolled out/stretched out and then brushed with butter.The filling is sprinkled on.The dough needs to be rolled up (which is hard with my tiny hands).Score the dough to help even sizing.Naturally, next you'd cut through.Place buns in the syrup laden pans (6 in each 13×9 pan, makes 12).Press down lightly on the buns, cover and rest (there is a 50 min option and a over-night option).If you refridgerate over night, they have to sit out before baking. They bake up nicely and must be turned out immediately.Now, if you're up to it, click here for the full recipe. Everyone at the party sure did love them!

I had totally forgotten about it for months but when I walked by today, I was ecstatic at the opportunity. As soon as I walked in, I wanted everything. They have pastas, sauces, dried and cured meats, breads, and cheeses galore. I had just stocked up in Chinatown so I had to exercise restraint and not buy too much. So, this post, you're only going to hear about the fresh mozzarella (and soon about the pork sausages I bought).

Sara and I met for lunch at Super Taste Restaurant Super Taste Restaurant, a no frills spot where you might have to share a table with strangers. We each got a bowl of Spicy Beef Noodle Soup and we agreed, it's better than Lan Zhou Handmade Noodles. These, also handmade, are just a bit bouncier (although they soften over time if you let them sit in the soup too long). The slices of beef were as tasty and plentiful as my memories of this from home. For $4.75, it's worth the trek and I'll be back to try their other offerings.

OK. I was under the impression that dim sums were dumplings. Momos are quite popular in Delhi and Calcutta in India as they have Tibetian settlements there.

Wonton Skin Ravioli
CONTENT
I had left-over wonton skins from when I made wontons and I remembered seeing a recipe for Butternut Squash Ravioli once, where they were made with wonton skins. I decided to try this idea out, but with a spinach ricotta filling. I like a higher proportion of spinach than ricotta, and upon tasting, Lon agreed.Wonton Skin Ravioli~about 25 ravioli (5 servings)1. In a large skillet (with a lid), heat olive oil. Put spinach in and spread garlic on top. Sprinkle with some kosher salt. Put lid on, turn off heat and rest for 5 minutes. Strain and press lightly to get out more liquid. Let it cool.2. In a medium sized bowl, mix together spinach, ricotta, salt and pepper (to taste).3. Set up a little bowl with water (for you to dip your finger in). Place 1 tablespoon of filling in the center of flat wonton skin. Dip your finger in water and wet the edge on the wonton skin.4. Place another skin directly on top and seal all four sides. Repeat step 3 and 4 till you finish the filling.5. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Boil ravioli for 2 minutes and drain carefully. Serve with red sauce.Well, you won't be able to fool anyone into thinking this is traditional ravioli, but, we still love it. The flavor is wonderful and the texture is much softer. It's a great lighter alternative. It saves a lot of time too.

I'm allergic to cheese.  Can you recommend a substitute for the ricotta?

Wow Jean, that's tough. You can try a butternut squash puree but it will taste entirely different.

Not sure if anyone's still reading this, but to answer Jean Tsao's question, use tofu. When substituting tofu for ricotta or cottage cheese, I just mash firm tofu with a potato masher. It's not quite the same, but close.  Good luck!

Crema Restaurant

We didn't know what to expect at Crema Restaurant Crema Restaurant, a place we've walked past so many times, but never entered. It was pretty empty, as many places seem to be these days. So we were very pleasantly surprised by how good the food was. We got great Mexican flavors without much grease, and everything was plated beautifully.Lon chose to do the brunch special. For $19, you get an entree, a side, and a mimosa (Lon asked for orange juice.)Chilaquiles Verdes y Rojos con Huevos Poche\"Baked Tortilla Casserole with shredded chicken breast, flavored with green and red salsa, Chihuahua cheese, crema, red onions, and fresh cilantro; topped with poached eggs\"Lon requested scrambled eggs instead of poached (which he never eats) and the result was delicious. The layering of flavors and textures here was really wonderful, a little crunch from tortilla, melty gooey cheese, tender chicken, soft eggs...yum. It was such a huge amount too.The side of beef breakfast sausages was fantastic, a little bit spicy and packed with flavor, with that kind of skin that pops a little when you bite.Peter had the brunch special as well.Burrito de Mole Poblano\"Flour tortilla with shredded chicken, Chihuahua cheese, beans, chipotle potatoes, corn and mole sauce\"We loved the cut-up burrito, which makes it so much easier to eat. The mole was a little spicy, a little sweet, and each bite was very tender.Peter chose the red rice as a side, pretty standard.I chose to go a la carte, and had a decent coffee to start .Chile Relleno de Papa con Chorizo y HuevoPoblano pepper filled with scrambled eggs, chorizo and potatoes,chihuahua cheese and cilantroPresented as an open-faced chile relleno, sitting on a flaky fried tortilla, it was really one of the most beautifully presented brunch dishes I've seen. Poblanos and chorizo are favorites of mine, and the refreshing green salsa just takes it over the top. (We asked to take the rest of the salsa home.)

Degustation
CONTENT
My friend Angie recommended Degustation Degustation a while ago and we finally got around to going. It's set up as a bar around the open kitchen, which is very cool, but not ideal for 4 people. It was a little harder to talk to our friends, Martin and Melissa, so I would recommend going in pairs. (Take a date if you want to impress.) I do strongly recommend going, so with just 16 seats, you'll need reservations.We did the 10-course tasting, which gives you a few of the dishes from their a la carte menu and a few unlisted items. The portions are quite large for a 1o-course tasting, using fresh and unique ingredients, well executed, well rounded, and all around fabulous. Lon and I shared a glass of Txakoli Txomin Etxaniz and it's now my favorite wine.Amuse: Oxtail Croquette and Potato Tortilla with Quail & Shallot ConfitThe oxtail was tender on the inside and crisp on the outside; and the tortilla oddly reminded me of a potsticker.The hamachi was very fresh and the plate is beautiful. The different textures (from crisp chips, rings of chile, firm fish, and perfect sauce) and various colors look like potpourri.On the right, a piece of nicely grilled sardine with lamb bacon, that tasted good but we found the micro-bones a tad annoying to eat.Think, very tender calamari (except sepia is cuttlefish), sitting in creamy garlicky aioli, and soothing risotto. This is decadent comfort food.The Dorade was cooked perfectly, but the flavors weren't as exciting here. The grapefruit in the foam was only noticeable if you ate it alone and the fried artichoke was great, but didn't add much to the combination. There were a few grape halves that added some acid but I really wanted more tang.Perfectly tender octopus, with crispy skinned pork belly. I liked the concept of citrus fruits and basil oil, but again, I wish the fruits were a little stronger.I'm not a fan of radish but the soup was very flavorful yet light. It was a nice break from the fatty courses. This seemed like a wonderful take on a fall soup, especially with the earthy mushroom slices and hearty rabbit in a light broth.Wow, how impressive... This is so rich and decadent that it makes sense to have in a very small portion. The little bits of duck bacon and chives make it dreamy.Lon's favorite: this dish was probably the most flavorful and we all loved the kick. My piece was a tad too salty, but the sweetbreads were perfectly cooked. The fresno peppers used to make the puree also appeared as slices in several other dishes -- it was a nice way to bring the menu together.This was one of my favorites (I couldn't pick one.) but anytime Wagyu Beef is around, it's likely to be my favorite. It's just so juicy and beefy and rare, with the roasted red peppers, a touch of cheese sauce, and some rye crisps, it just brings a smile to my face. The red onion relish was a sweet addition to the dish. This one is a available a la carte, so even if you don't try the tasting menu, be sure to order it!Is it wrong for one of my favorites to be the palate cleanser? This was freakin' good. The very strong ginger really cuts the alcohol and sugar.The brioche is soaked in cream and then caramelized, leaving the inside super soft and creamy, while the outside is crisp but delicate. This is another of my favorites.Bravo Degustation!

I'm so glad you finally went and happy you enjoyed it. I'm always afraid that I over hype things. However, it managed to hit all four of the most important things for me when i eat out. Interesting, fresh and tasty food, good wine (or cocktails), reasonable prices and good service. Degustation gets an extra point for the open kitchen. I love watching people cook.

Knish Nosh in Central Park
CONTENT
I grew up in Forest Hills and my mom had a boutique clothing store on the border of Forest Hills and Rego Park. Across Queens Boulevard was a shop called Knish Nosh, which had wonderful knishes. (Every Jewish person I have ever met knows about this place.) As a kid, I ate these knishes, my favorites being plain or broccoli, quite often.In the city, there are several delis and bagel stores that carry knishes from the Knish Nosh, but looking on their website, I now see a few more locations. Their newest one (and most convenient location for me) is not even listed on their own website yet. It's right in Central Park, by Sailboat Pond. I was happy to spot this childhood favorite while Lon rented a sailboat and fulfilled one of his own childhood joys. Unfortunately, service is absurdly slow (even by Midwest standards) and prices are quite high (almost double their Queens prices), but good food in Central Park on a lovely Saturday afternoon is probably worth it.

If you made the Red Braised Pork Belly, you'll have a lot of left over sauce/liquid. Growing up, my mom would often use this sauce to cook the hard bean curd and eggs. It's so simple yet so good, and totally nostalgic for those of us who grew up in Chinese homes.

Posto Thin Crust Pizza
CONTENT
We went to Posto Posto last night and I have to complain about how tight the squeeze is. We sat in a booth and it's really not enough space for 4 people. Being winter, the coats make it worse. There's just nowhere to put your stuff. Then when you get food, there isn't enough room on the table for each persons plate, and the experience winds up being general discomfort.For a pizza place, they do a pretty nice job with salads, fresh and nicely plated. The Mediterranean Salad has a lot of color and the dressing it light.We were really impressed that the Caesar Salad dressing was actually made with anchovy and that the amount of dressing was appropriate. I don't think I've eaten Caesar Salad in years because I'm so afraid of the standard globs of dressing.For pizza, Posto wasn't kidding about the thin crust. It's pretty close to a cracker, which achieves crispiness, but then lacks the chewiness of a well developed dough. The sauce and cheese on the Classico is fresh and tasty, and pretty light.We also got another pie, half Shroomtown, half Meatball Classic. Lon liked the meatballs, I didn't (too much thyme), but we both agree that it was very skimpy on the cheese, which made it not really pizza for me. The Shroom half, covered in portobellos, shitake, white button, and truffle oil, was wonderful, hearty and well seasoned. Generally, the ingredients were very good but the crusts are what hold the pizzas back from being great.

Ippudo Media Event
CONTENT
On Wednesday night, Lon and I went to Ippudo's Ippudo Media Event: the unveiling of their seasonal dishes. If you've been reading Foodmayhem for a while, you know that inviting us somewhere, and giving us lots of free food, isn't enough to get lavish praise from us. We're wickedly honest, and with that honesty, we both have to say that Ippudo's ramen is quite wonderful. Note that I said, \"Ippudo's Ramen\", because the appetizers really didn't impress us. We sampled Octopus Sashimi, some fried fish, a duck appetizer, and a Chef's Tasting. The duck was the best one but none were memorable or worth really describing.Tori Ramen \"A Chicken and Tonkatsu (pork) broth with salt, Berkshire Pork, hard boiled egg, onions, bamboo shoot, and fish cake.This is a very basic ramen, the lightest of the six, but basic doesn't mean bland or boring. It's full of meaty flavor and 1/8″ wide noodles. The slices of pork were dry and the other toppings didn't do much either, but the broth is what shines.They say Chinese-inspired, but it also seems a little Thai-inspired, with the sour, salty, and sweet. It was the most complex of the six and I loved the first few bites (especially the thin curly noodles). I would have a hard time eating a whole bowl though, because it was just a tad too salty and heavy on the sesame paste.This one is truly unique, the flavor of a very dark roast, yet not even a hint of charring. The seasoning is perfect and it feel like a hearty meal.I think this our favorite (even Lon who doesn't like Miso loved it). While I really liked most of them, this was the one I thought was most balanced, flavorful but not too over-done. I could really eat a big bowl of this one and feel soothed and satiated.Lon liked this one but it was the one bowl I didn't care for. The use of simple Italian flavors, tomato, oregano, and mozzarella, doesn't fit in this setting for me, especially the floating pieces of mozzarella. Just to be clear, there are no meatballs in it. Suitably, they use a slightly wider noodle, maybe 1/4″, so it's closer to spaghetti, and it seems like a lot of thought was put into it, but still, I'm not a fan.These noodles had that bouncy texture only fresh noodles can achieve. The duck (ooh, so tender) and the warm meaty dipping sauce, make this play on soba a more wintery meal.

Dominos Hot Sandwiches
CONTENT
Lately, Domino's has been advertising like crazy about their Oven Baked Sandwiches. I'm a total sucker for food advertising, so I've been dying to try one. Tim suggested using RetailMeNot.com's Domino's Page, to get some coupons, which we did, and we ordered all four of the types of sandwiches: Chicken Bacon Ranch, Philly Cheese Steak, Italian, and Chicken Parm.We followed our order status closely using the really nifty Domino's Pizza Tracker. Our \"Delivery Expert\", Celio, was incredibly impressed that we knew his name when he showed up. Unfortunately, we didn't get to directly pay our compliments to Pablo, who prepared our order.Tim snapped a few pics of the sandwiches before we gobbled them up. If you want to see his full set check them out on Flickr.I was surprised at the size of the sandwich, they look a bit smaller than expected. But actually, they are a good size for $4.99 (or less with coupon). They come pre-cut (on a steep angle), so we cut the halves in half, and all four of us got a quarter of each sandwich. Our initial impressions were that they are not particularly attractive sandwiches, and they are unbelievably greasy. Later I found out that they are soaked in a \"butter flavored oil\".After eating, I asked Melinda, Gabe, and Tim to rank the sandwiches from best to worst, and we came up with the following rating (lower numbers are better):In my opinion, the table very accurately reflects the reality of the sandwiches. The Italian and Philly are both about the same and both are substantially more enjoyable than the two chicken sandwiches. The chicken meat itself is part of the problem; it literally tastes like shoe rubber. I'm not going to describe those two except to say: don't order them.The Philly Cheese Steak has steak, provolone cheese, onions, mushrooms. As long as you don't go in expecting a real philly cheese steak, as you could get in Philadelphia, you may enjoy the sandwich. The provolone is milky and the onions are sweet.The Italian has pepperoni, salami, ham, banana peppers, along with peppers, onions, and provolone cheese. It is quite salty and the meats are oily, but it tastes similar to what one would expect an Italian sandwich to taste like.In the end, the sandwichs are ok for the price. But if you compare them to the market (Subway and Quizno's), I've got to recommend you stick with Subway and Quizno's. Except that Domino's delivers to you, everything else is worse. The bread is worse, the quality of ingredients is worse, and all four of us were queasy for the rest of the afternoon. You probably never hear about the other side of food during reviews, but let me advise you: this food will make you gasy! I've never felt sick after eating Subway; and while I'm not a big fan of Quizno's, I've never been sick after them as well.As another aside, while writing this I looked up the nutrition info about the sandwiches. Almost 900 calories, 106% daily sodium 110% saturated fat; that is disgusting. I feel worse now.

Rice Crackers from Japan

When Lon went to Sushi Yasuda for lunch (without ME!), he saw our Chef Tomura, who had just returned from Japan a few days earlier. To our total surprise, he brought us a gift, rice crackers from Japan. I'm floored by the sweet gesture. To me, everything from Japan is magical, a land where food is revered. The packaging is distinct, beautiful and decorated with restraint.

Basic Wontons
CONTENT
The traditional basic wonton is made with a pork filling and I decided to do just that, nothing fancy or inventive, just a good basic wonton.Basic Wontons~about 55 wontons1. In a large bowl, mix together pork, scallions, egg, soy sauce, and sesame oil.2. Set up your wonton making station: You need a little bowl with water (this is for you to dip your finger in) and a wet paper towel to lay over the wonton wrappers (to keep them moist).3. Lay a wonton wrapper flat and put roughly 1 1/2 teaspoon of filling on it, a little below center.

Sushi Yasuda #23
CONTENT
Yesterday I was going to try Sakae Sushi with Jamie. He is a sushi-fan and both of us were excited to give Sakae a try. It seems like an interesting place as patrons order on computer and receive food by conveyor belt. Unfortunately, standing there in the cold, pouring rain, I read that they were closed for kitchen renovations. Fortunately, our favorite sushi place is just down the block. So off to Sushi Yasuda Jamie and I went.Unfortunately, Chef Tomura was busy serving four other patrons, so we sat one seat over with his neighboring chef, who is always very nice as well (I don't know his name). We shmoozed as we ate through various nigiri and make sushi. During that first round I got to try Cobia; which is not a rare fish, but not often seen in the NYC sushi scene. I didn't have the camera with me, but I can tell you it is a white fish with a tender, bouncy meat. I really enjoyed it.We were feeling pretty full (by lunch standardS); but, this being Jamie's first time and having told me he loves eel, he tried the White Sea Eel (sawani), which is my favorite piece. He loved it. I also tried another piece of Botan Shrimp, which was so delicious.I was happy to see that Chef Tomura is back from Japan; Jessica and I will see him again soon.

Red Braised Pork Belly
CONTENT
Red Braised or Red Cooked is the quintessential Chinese Home-style Cooking Method. I grew up on Red Cooked Pork, Beef, Fish, Tofu, etc. Everyone loves it and it's really quite simple to make.Red Braised Pork Belly1. Spray a large skillet with non-stick and heat on low. Melt the rock candy and when there's enough melted (a bit more than half), put the pork belly, skin side down, on the sugar. Allow the skin to get crispy.2. Add soy sauce, 2 1/2 cups of water, ginger and scallions and bring to a boil.3. Reduce to a simmer and cook for 25 minutes, uncovered.4. Turn the pork belly on its side and add remaining cup of water. Bring to a boil. Reduce to a simmer and continue for another 10 minutes. Turn onto the other side and cook for another 10 minutes.

Giorgio's of Gramercy
CONTENT
My parents came into the city last night to pick up some stuff, so we decided to try Giorgio's of Gramercy Giorgio's of Gramercy. It was surprisingly empty, even for a Sunday evening. The bread and olive oil aren't worth eating, but luckily, I wasn't at all hungry (after the late mega brunch at Compass). They also offer a complimentary plate of cucumbers topped with pastrami cured salmon and chopped apples. Both the look and taste of it seemed like an attempt on fancy and elegant, which it did not quite accomplish, but was tasty anyway.Our waitress told us they were known for the Roasted Oysters so we tried them and they were certainly the best item of the night. Shallots are just a wonderful match to the fragrance of the sea, and although these were perfectly cooked, I still prefer raw, because it's meatier that way.Lon also ordered a half plate of Bucatini with Smoked Trout and Butternut Squash as an appetizer. ( I love places that let you order half servings of pasta.) This was one of those decadent dishes that tastes so good for two bites and then it's too much for me. The smoked trout was wonderful though, and the butternut squash unnecessary.

Brunch at Compass
CONTENT
Compass Compass serves a lavish and filling brunch. It's set up as a pre-fix where each person chooses their entree and several starters and desserts are served for the table. First, a basket of cornbread, chocolate chip crumb muffins, and a cinnamon bun arrives. The cornbread had too much baking powder or soda which leaves that lingering chemical taste in your mouth. The muffins were not special, but the cinnamon bun was adored by all, soft and not-too-sweet dough, very sweet frosting on top. It was simple but good.I ordered the Steak and Eggs. The Filet Mignon was perfectly medium-rare as requested and the jus was heavenly. You can't see underneath the meat, but there was a bit of sauteed spinach, and under that, an oily but flavorful mix of roasted peppers and waxy potatoes with skin on. Although the flavors were very enjoyable, it was too heavy for brunch. Even the sunny side up eggs had oil drizzled over them.

Conch Fritters
CONTENT
Back in college, I went to the Bahamas with my girlfriends for spring break. Everywhere you go, they serve conch fritters. As much as I loved them in the beginning, I couldn't look at another conch fritter by the 3rd day. You don't see conch fritters much in NY (I probably never have), so I was ready for conch fritters again. I looked up several recipes but I didn't have the standard ingredients so we improved a bit and ended up with non-traditional but very good conch fritters. How bad can any deep fried batter be, right?Conch FrittersDipping SauceBefore we start, here's what conch looks like before being cleaned (yup, they're ugly suckers):1. Make the dipping sauce first by mixing all the ingredients together. Set aside.2. Cut the conch in half and place them on a cutting board. Place a piece of plastic wrap over them and pound them. Put them in a food processor and process for a few seconds, until it looks roughly chopped.3. In a medium bowl, mix together conch, scallion, onion, pepper, and tomato paste. Season with salt and pepper. Mix well.4. Sprinkle the flour, cornmeal, and baking powder over it and mix well. Add water a little at a time while mixing, until all the water is used.5. Heat oil to about 375 degrees F. Drop tablespoonfuls of batter into the oil. Fry until golden brown and floating on the top.6. Remove from oil and drain on paper towels. Serve immediately with dipping sauce.

The only time I have conch is when my mom makes soup with it and we just eat it dipped in soy sauce. My brother and I like the texture since it gets really tender from boiling in the soup for 5+ hours but still has a toothy bite! But after seeing your conch fritters, I want some of that~

problem with conch fritters is that they're taking a fundamentally mediocre ingredient and masking it with lots of  other ingredients, frying and sauce.  I've never  enjoyed them.  In my experience they basically come out like mildly fish flavored chewy fried bread.
Jessica@Foodmayhem

On Thursday night, Angie brought over two flavors of Vosges Chocolates: everyone favored the Barcelona with hickory smoked almonds and grey sea salt, in a deep milk chocolate. The almonds were chopped up, adding a little crunch, and the salt is the perfect contrast to the mild sweetness. While the curry in the Naga Bar was extremely light, it was more interesting than desirable.

Raisin Banana Bread Pudding
CONTENT
I had a little less than half of the raisin bread from the Chinese Bakery left. I had some ripe bananas, and I wanted to use them up. Naturally, the ingredients lend themselves to Bread Pudding. A couple of things to note here: organic half and half is a bit thinner than regular, at least it seems to be, to me. I added raisins because Chinese bakery raisin bread doesn't have much raisins in it so adjust depending on how much raisin the bread already has. If you can't get your hands on Chinese bakery raisin bread, try challah or raisin challah.Raisin Banana Bread Pudding~6-8 servings1. Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (300 degrees F with convection) and spray a 8×8 glass dish with non-stick.2. Put 4 cups of bread in the dish. Arrange bananas in one layer and sprinkle with raisins. Arrange the remaining bread on top.3. Whisk together eggs, half and half, white sugar, vanilla extract, and cinnamon. Pour over the bread and bananas. Using your fingers, press down on the wet bread mixture.4. Bake for 50 minutes or until the bread pudding is set.5. You can serve warm or room temperature. Drizzle with condensed milk.The fresh banana flavor really comes through and since bread pudding is really pretty much the same as French Toast, feel free to have it for breakfast too.

Curry Beef Skewers
CONTENT
I hesitate to call these Curry Beef Skewers because the curry isn't so pronounced that you'll think of this as a curry dish. However, the curry is what makes it extra special and your guests will be asking, what makes this beef so good?Skewering does take a bit of work, but it's an otherwise very simple recipe that takes very little skill. Bring these to a party and you'll be very popular.Curry Beef Skewers~4-5 servings1. Cut flank against the grain, on a slant, to get thin long slices, like ribbons. Place in a tupperware container.2. Put the rest of the ingredients in a blender and pulse for 15 seconds.3. Pour over flank and mix until well distributed. Cover and refrigerate for 4 hours. (Soak wooden skewers if using.)4. Preheat the grill. Thread onto skewers like you're sewing.5. Place each skewer on the grill for about 2-3 minutes on each side, depending on how hot your grill is. Sprinkle with scallion and cilantro to serve.

Monster Sushi
CONTENT
Monster Sushi Monster Sushi uses fresh ingredients but it's nothing outstanding. I consider it the Japanese version of a diner. They have a broad menu of sushi, rolls, noodles, and other entrees. It's not too bad, not too great, high enough turnover to ensure freshness, but skill lacks refinement, and everything kind of tastes the same. The rolls are quite large so edamame and 4 rolls (Spicy Salmon, Dynamite roll, Dinosaur roll, Monster Roll) was too much for my friend Monica and I, when normally that would be too little for two people. The prices are moderate so this may be the thing for some, but like diners, this kind of place doesn't excite me.

Slow Roasted Tomatoes
CONTENT
Now that tomato season is over, you won't be able to get those wonderful farmer's market tomatoes. You'll need this recipe to deal with the supermarket quality ones, or more like non-quality ones. I make this in large batches because it's work intensive but stores well. I wish I made 4 times this amount.Slow Roasted Tomatoes1. Peel tomatoes and cut them in half. Using a spoon, scoop out the seeds and discard. Place the halves, cut side up, in a tupperware container. Sprinkle salt and sugar over tomatoes. You can layer the tomatoes but make sure to sprinkle on each layer. Store, covered, overnight.2. Preheat oven to 275 degrees F (250 degrees F with convection). Drain tomatoes.3. Lay the tomatoes in a single layer on a sheet pan, cut side up. Sprinkle with thyme and drizzle with olive oil.4. Stick it in the oven for 2 to 3 hours, or until they are wilted but not burnt. The amount of time depends on the size of the tomatoes. See pic.These taste amazing on their own, but can also be used for an endless array of other dishes.

Lunch at Punch

I've had brunch at Punch Punch before, but today we had lunch, which is a completely different menu. Lon and Ekta chose the Fresh Pappardelle with Veal Bolognese, which was the wise choice, a fresh al dente pasta (of one of my favorite shapes) and meat sauce just can't go wrong. The purple carrots and cherry tomatoes added the perfect amount of sweetness, and I couldn't stop stealing several bites from Lon's plate.

Sweet Toast
CONTENT
Sweet Toast is a Taiwanese Cafe food, found in casual places in NY like bubble tea shops. I guess it's really Chinese junk food, but I can't help it, I love it! It's so simple though, I never buy it anymore. I just make it.It's made with thick-cut (or buy unsliced and cut yourself) Chinese bakery bread (plain or raisin). Just spread with salted butter (or use unsalted butter and sprinkle with kosher salt) and toast lightly. Place it on a plate and pour sweetened condensed milk on top. Think of it as an alternative to French Toast and you can have it for breakfast. Think of it as a subsitute for bread pudding and you can have it for dessert. Either way, you will be amazed at how wonderful this is for barely any work. If you don't have any Chinese bakeries nearby, try it with brioche or challah. It won't be the same but I'm sure it will be delicious too.

Table cream is used on enchiladas, chilaquiles, tacos...basically anything Americans put sour cream on. The nice part is that it isn't sour, so it has multiple purposes. I put in on french toast with condensed milk, on tacos, and I love pouring it over fresh berries or oranges with a bit of cinnamon.

Jessica@Foodmayhem

According to The Cook's Thesauraus, table cream is also called light cream or coffee cream, and is 18-30% butterfat. That places it in between the fat content of half & half, and light whipping cream. I've seen light cream in the same section where half and half and heavy cream etc. are and I think I've used it before in coffee.

My mom has been getting tofu from Kwong Hop Inc. Kwong Hop Inc. for years. I highly recommend going for the freshest tofu (pre-packed or not), fried tofu, Do Fu Hwa, or soy bean milk. Don't be confused when you arrive. There is no retail store. You'll see a sign over a driveway so walk up the driveway and you'll see the tofu factory. You can just walk right in to it and buy any of their products. One problem though. I don't think they speak English, but you can try just pointing and holding out money. It's totally worth it.

Do Fu Hwa is a silky soft soy pudding/custard served with ginger syrup, warm or chilled. I prefer cold, which is more of a dessert, like a tofu flavored jello/custard, not so sweet tofu flan? Served warm, it's more of a breakfast, an alternative to soy bean milk. It can only be found at tofu stores and dim sum places, maybe a few Chinese markets, but it's worth the search. It's sometimes packaged like this:

Wow, trying to get reservations for brunch on the Upper West Side is harder than it sounds. Nearly every reputable place is just first come first serve. So if you're not down for long lines, one option we found is The Neptune Room The Neptune Room. Between Sara, Winnie, and I, we got a nice array of dishes.Sara's Vanilla Bean French Toast was humongous. The crispy edges give way to the soft fluffy insides wonderfully, but I don't taste vanilla bean, and it's under-sweet for me. This can be easily corrected with the maple syrup but I prefer a lightly sweetened French Toast that doesn't need the syrup.My \"Paella\" and Eggs was generous with the shrimp but severely under-seasoned, again correctable as there's salt and pepper on the table but still points get taken off. I only noticed looking at the menu now that the paella is in quotes, which explains why it wasn't really a paella, more of a fried rice using strips of chorizo, shrimp, and peas. The sunny side up eggs were standard.

If the weather is not enough to let you know it's Fall, the farmer's market will. Every other stand has a beautiful selection of fall veggies, including many types of squash. After laughing about how some pumpkins were bigger than Ice (our dog); I picked up a butternut and a delicata. My goal was to make a glowing orange, fall soup that could shine above the rest, something to really get people excited about squash soup.Jessica and I LOVE the finished product. It is perfect, seriously. The spice and fall flavors combine perfectly, this soup will make you feel warmed for the cool weather. While eating it, Jessica said she could imagine herself sitting in a log cabin, by a fire, drinking this soup.Unsquashed Squash Soup~ approximately 10 cupsIngredientsInstructionsServe soup piping hot and garnished with reserved bacon. If you were so inclined, you could salt and toast the delicata squash seeds and use those for garnish as well (but I did not). I love the green specks of pasilla and red specks of red pepper. It's a beautiful, delicious soup.

Lemon Rosemary Chicken Kebabs
CONTENT
This is a quick and easy dinner, but so tasty, a perfect example of when simple is so good. The juicy chunks of chicken are so lemon-y, contrasted by the earthy aroma of rosemary. Notice that the chicken only has to be marinated for 30 minutes, unlike the many recipes you'll see requiring 4 hours to overnight. Yet, the flavor is well developed.Lemon Rosemary Chicken Kebabs~3 servings1. In a medium bowl, mix together lemon juice, oil, garlic, mustard, and zest.2. Stir in chicken chunks and allow to sit for 30 minutes. Preheat your grill.3. Skewer the chicken onto the rosemary branches, pushing the bottom end through the chicken first (if you go the other way, all the rosemary leaves will fall off.)4. Season with salt and pepper. Place on the grill. The grilling time will depend on how hot your grill is. On our grill, it takes 6-7 minutes on each side. Look for when the juices run clear.

I started making this Apple Rum Cake (from Nick Malgieri's Perfect Cakes) way too late last night. Before it was done, Lon and I had fallen asleep on the couch. When the timer went off, I took the cake out of the oven, but it still had to be cooled, so we just set it on the counter and went to bed. (I can barely remember any of this because we were just walking zombies last night.)The good news is, we woke up with breakfast already made. I normally try to eat healthy breakfasts but once in a while, cake and coffee is a real treat. Since we were eating it as breakfast, I decided not to add the glaze and it was perfect, a light and mildly sweet cake with apple filling. It was like an apple shortcake and I didn't feel as guilty. I made Lon take the rest to work so I wouldn't eat more of it.

Latin Fried Rice
CONTENT
We got home tonight from the Light the Night Walk, an awareness / fundraiser for The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society. It was really a great time -- we took Ice (our dog) down to South Street Seaport and signed in. We got a few hot dogs, balloons, wrist bands, a bag of chips and hung around the huge crowd. Fortunately, we happened to be near the starting point of the walk, so we were amongst the first few hundred people heading to the Brooklyn Bridge. We walked halfway across then turned around and walked back. When we got off at City Hall Park we fed Ice and then it was our turn.We hopped a cab home and I started steaming some rice. I was going to make fried rice with what we had in the fridge. After I pulled out a jalapeno and salchichon, Jessica suggested pushing it all the way into being a fusion fried rice Spanish meets Chinese. It came out great! We discovered the happy accidental realization that the salchichon has the same texture and consistency as Chinese sausage. Perfect.Latin Fried Rice~makes 4-6 servings as side dishIngredientsInstructionsWhen stir frying, there are basically three tips for success. First, prep all your ingredients before turning on the heat. That is critical. The other tips are all in the name: stir & fry. Keep the heat VERY HIGH and STIR CONSTANTLY and VIGOROUSLY. Keeping everything moving does several things: it evenly heats, keeps ingredients from burning and sticking, and combines the mixture.Sadly we gobbled the food up so fast, we didn't snap a picture of the finished product, but it looked good. We both really enjoyed this dish and think you will too.

I subscribed to your blog quite a few months ago and have been slowly going through the archives.  I love your reviews and recipes and look forward to trying many of them! I saw one post that caught my attention.  My friends and I are going to have dinner in chinatown tonight and I know your view on New Yeah Shanghai has changed...but thats the destination tonight - by majority vote.  I checked their menu and didn't see the crab and rice cakes on the menu on menupages - would you know if its on the menu at the restaurant? Or would I have to order it in chinese?  The post I am referring to is:  http://foodmayhem.com/2008/01/new-yeah-shanghai.phpThanks!!

I will def try this, I have tried to make my own kimchee in the past.  I ended up with watery spicy won bok instead of my desired results.  So sad.  I have to say this is one of the great dishes in the world that is done wrong much more often than done right.

JP, you could always hit K-town tonight.Taryn, thanks for reading!Menupages is not always updated, especially by ethnic restaurants because the restaurant has to write in to ask for changes. As for the crab dish, I don't know if it's written anywhere but I'm pretty sure they have it so, just describe it to the waiter...crab with minced meat and soybeans over rice cakes....Let me know how it goes tonight. I've been debating whether I should give them another shot or not....they used to be my all time favorite for soup dumplings.Bill, I'm trying to get the recipe and will post it if I do.

Scott's mom makes delicious kimchi, but one thing I realized that makes a huuuuggeee difference is that she has a special refrigerator that has temperature control and different fermentation processes to store her kimchi. Everytime we take the kimchi to Scott's and leave it in the regular fridge it just doesn't taste as good after a few days.

4 Courses and No Recipes
CONTENT
We were so excited to have foodies from out of town join us for dinner. Unfortunately, we also had a Fios installation that got delayed 5 times (meaning we waited each time and they never showed up) and ended up finally happening yesterday. They occupied my kitchen and dining room (really my living room with a table that just folds out to be bigger) from around 10:20am to around 4pm. I had to simplify my plans a bit and that also meant no recipe writing. Hopefully you'll enjoy the pics anyway.We started with a Warm Bruschetta of Slow Roasted Tomatoes with thinly sliced garlic. (We forgot to take a pic until we almost finished it.)After slicing, it was arranged on some Sweet Potato Mash.

Spicy White Chocolate
CONTENT
For some reason, I had a hankering for spicy white chocolate. I couldn't stop thinking about how to make it something really special and interesting. First I thought about putting some jalapenos in the chocolate. Then later, when Jessica and I went for a walk, I realized that almonds would go great, as would some salt.Monday morning, being off from work, I stopped by Whole Foods and picked up some over-priced Callebaut white chocolate and jalapenos. Then went home and got to work.Spicy White Chocolate BarIngredientsInstructionsFor next time (or for you), here are some tips that I highly recommend:

Saul Restaurant

Lon had a day off yesterday so we decided to make the trek out to Brooklyn to try Saul Restaurant Saul Restaurant. Chef and Owner, Saul Bolton has worked at places like Bouley and Le Bernardin, so expectations were set high. The space is simple and modest, almost boring, but the food does shine.An amuse of celery root soup with curried apples was the perfect way to start our evening. The soup was rich and creamy, yet so smooth and felt almost aerated or fluffy in some way. The lightly curried apples added just a little sweetness and we both wanted to lick the bowl.

How to Peel Tomatoes
CONTENT
Have you seen \"peeled tomatoes\" in a recipe and thought what is that? Well it's quite simply, peeled tomatoes. The problem is that fresh tomatoes are hard to peel. So, here's what you do. Fill a pot (size depends on how many tomatoes you're peeling) with water, sprinkle with salt, and bring to a rapid boil.

Lean Lamb Roast over Butternut Squash and Parnsips
CONTENT
Fresh Direct had lamb top round for sale and I was happy to see that it came in a 1 1/2 pound size, which is manageable. I decided on a simple preparation that would help me utilize the butternut squash and parsnip, I just got from the farmer's market. What stands out for me is that this cut of lamb is so lean. The ingredients give the feel of fall, yet it's very light and perfect for this very warm fall we're having.Lean Lamb Roast over Butternut Squash and Parsnips~3 servings1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (375 degrees F with convection). Cover a 9X13 pan with aluminum foil.2. Scatter butternut squash and parsnip across the pan. Drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with Moroccan Spice Mix. Season generously.3. Cover lamb with rosemary and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Place it on top of the butternut squash and parnsip.4. Bake uncovered for 30 minutes. Turn over and bake for another 30 minutes, or until internal temperature is 145 degrees F. (If you like it past medium rare, cook it longer).5. Remove it from the oven. Place lamb roast on a cutting board to rest for 5 minutes. Transfer butternut squash and parsnips to serving platter. Taste and season if necessary. Slice lamb and place on top.

Menchanko-Tei
CONTENT
Making my way throught the ramen joints...I tried Menchanko-Tei Menchanko-Tei this Saturday. I ordered the Menchanko, figuring their name sake should be good. What's interesting is that this one uses their thick ramen as opposed the the traditional thin ramen, which they also serve. Ultimately, I wasn't that impressed by the noodles or the broth, but I liked the mix of toppings: shrimp, tofu (soft and fried), salmon ball, a cube of mochi-like stuff, cabbage, and scallions. For $8.95, it's worth it.

Also, it's not as thick as udon, just a little thicker than the standard ramen. They also serve udon though.

BLT Fish - a Second Visit
CONTENT
I'm scared for all the restaurants these days. With the current economy, I think we'll be seeing a lot of great places close. On Friday afternoon, we called BLT Fish BLT Fish to get a reservation for that evening and it was no problem. I don't think that would have been the case 6 months ago.The weather has been incredibly warm for October so I was suddenly craving the raw bar sampler platter at BLT Fish and Lon was totally in. They have fantastic oysters, clams, Whelks, and more. The experience was very similar to last time (complimentary smoked tuna and the incredible Cheddar and Chive Biscuits) except that we now know how filling that $75 raw sampler platter is. We also know that we like the raw stuff, appetizers, and sides better than the main courses. We chose the Rock Shrimp Risotto and the Herbed Gnocchi Beurre Blanc. (I'm so sorry that we forgot to bring the camera; we have that brain lapse occasionally.) The abundant amount of rock shrimp were so perfectly cooked, yet the dish was piping hot (would totally impress my dad). The mussel jus was so flavorful, perfectly seasoned, and it was unique. Bravo! Now, their gnocchi is always wonderful. Over a year ago, we had a different preparation, with tomato sauce and parmesan. They now make it with a Beurre Blanc sauce, a perfectly smooth one, and it's still the best textured gnocchi in town. It did come out with cool centers but we sent it back and they happily brought us nice hot ones and more of them. I really don't like to say \"best\" anything and I don't do it often, but I have to insist that they have the best gnocchi (odd since they're a fish place)!With that, you will be full, and we tried not to have dessert (which we have too much), but we happened to bump into our sweet neighbor (the wine guy), who was visiting the restaurant (a client of his) and he sent us desserts. We got a Banana Cake with Chai Ice Cream which was not impressive, but the Creme Caramel was one of the best ever, extra rich and creamy, highlighting the flavor of burnt sugar, and little bits of grapefruit that really added a nice touch.Hope everyone's having a great Columbus Day Weekend and I hope your favorite restaurants don't close.

Home-made Marshmallows
CONTENT
Marshmallows are one of those things that I didn't think I liked. All I had ever tried (prior to working in a restaurant) was that commercial crap that comes in bags. I thought they were just sugary and very artificial tasting stuff. One day, I tried a home-made marshmallow and wow, it was actually quite good.Recently, we had an incredible Mexican hot chocolate when we were in Chicago, with a killer marshmallow. That reminded me, I wanted to try making these things. It always seemed daunting because it's so sticky. I was sure it would be quite difficult but I was ready to try. I got a well-rated recipe on epicurious.com an I'm no longer scared of making these and will probably do it again.You basically bloom some gelatin, boil up the sugar and corn syrup, and pour the hot mixture into the gelatin while whipping.After pouring it, the instructions say to \"smooth top\" but that seems impossible. See how it's not so flat?

I only make nachos once per year, during the Super Bowl.  I take two bags of chips, 3 kinds of cheese, refried beans, scallions, cilantro, guacamole, sour cream, onions, jalepenos, home made salsa, (last year I also tried bbq sauce, interesting, but not necessary).  This year I'll be using some chipotle.  Remember secret to nachos, pre-heat the beans before baking the heated ingredients, works much better.

Beckmen Vineyards Grenache Rose
CONTENT
My sweet neighbor works in the wine business. I know what you're thinking: What a waste...Lon and I aren't really drinkers. Well, my neighbor gave us a bottle of Beckmen Vineyards Grenache Rose so we invited some of my friends (who do love wine) over to enjoy. This bottle was so interesting because it's a bright red, still clear, but much darker then the standard rose. I was totally intrigued. My take is that it tastes like a white and a red, as if you poured a little bit of each into the cup. (That is not how it is made.) If you want a wine-lovers description, I found one on Mike the Wine Guy's blog. In any case, it was good.

TITLE
Quicker No-Knead Bread
CONTENT
We've talked about Jim Lahey's No Knead Bread before, in our Mother's Day post (2007). It's pretty much dummy proof, you barely do a thing, and you get a fantastic artisanal hearth bread. The only downside is that you have to have incredible foresight. It takes a minimum of 15 hours from start to finish (don't worry, it's rising time and you don't do anything). To me, it was already a blessed gift from heaven, but then Mark Bittman went and released a 5 hour No Knead Bread. Of course we had to test it out and yes, it's just as fabulous. We made both last night and it has the same wonderful crispy crust, soft, chewy, and bouncy inside, wonderful flavor. The result is pretty much the same as the original No Knead Bread, one that you'd easily pay $4 for at a bakery. The only downside I can see is that it requires bread flour, which not everyone keeps at home, but I do. Woohoo!

Ooo, that looks wonderful right about now.. I need breakfast! Anywho, I'd like to give this a try and wanted to ask if I can add things like seeds and raisins to the recipe? Also, can I get bread flour in a regular supermarket... and will the label actually say "bread flour?" Thanks =)

eatingfoodboy, traditional methods require kneading (more work) and it also helps to have experience with doughs so that you can tell when it's done kneading. The no knead recipes are amaxing because you just throw together the ingredients and wait, then bake. No work and no expertise needed.

Fried Chicken Mac 'n' Cheese
CONTENT
Jessica went out to dinner with a friend last night and left me home to fend for myself. Fortunately she had defrosted some chicken thighs for me to experiment... I mean cook with. When Jessica is around I cook healthier, she reminds me to use less fat, and to make normal (read: human-sized) portions. However, when she's not around, well, all hell breaks loose.I stared into the fridge and saw the chicken, I also saw chicken broth, milk, tons of cream cheese, a block of cheddar cheese, parmesan, bacon... it was obvious what had to be done: mac and cheese with deep fried chicken IN IT!I began by roughly cutting the chicken into about 1-inch chunks. I seasoned flour, breadcrumbs, and eggs, battered, and began deep-frying the nuggets in vegetable oil. At the same time, I cooked off the remaining elbows from a box of Barilla. After straining the pasta, I shredded lots of cheese, and minced onion and garlic. I also chopped up some bacon and started rendering it in the same pot I boiled the elbows.Once the bacon was getting crisp, I removed the very fatty pieces, and added in the onion and garlic. Then once soft, I threw in a tablespoon or so of butter (for good measure), and started sprinkling in my remaining seasoned flour (from the chicken). I made a blonde roux.It was looking awesome.Then I added in a few tablespoons of whole milk, and had a smooth roux working. Then I extended it with chicken broth until soupy. Next it was cheese time... This was a whole new recipe for me. I tossed in 4oz of cream cheese and the cheddar cheese (about a cup, shredded). It was looking good, but I needed to take things up a notch. I sprinkled in a bunch of mustard powder, turmeric, and cayenne. Yes! Now it's on.The orange hue was mesmerizing. Cream cheese in mac and cheese was new for me, but it really added a smoothness that I've never achieved before. And, of course, a homemade roux is always best.I folded in the elbows followed by the chicken nuggets. I considered eating it. But, there was more to be done. I transferred it all into an 8×8″ baking dish and covered it with the remaining breadcrumbs (from the chicken) and then added lots of shredded parmesan on top. I wasn't worried about raw chicken in the breadcrumbs, since I cooked it at 450 deg F for 15 minutes. The fat in this dish was far more dangerous.Behold what came out:OH... MY... GOD. This is a winner. It's the best of fried chicken and mac and cheese in one dish of deliciousness. Remember that crazy sandwich I loved, which btw, I eventually did try? This is it, on a plate. If you have an hour to spend cooking, do this. It is fun and nuts and wonderful.

HAHA.anyway ... all i could say ur new recipe is very yum because of the cheese and the mix of spices. i think i could try it at home too when i cook pasta. but i think i will omit the cream cheese. the last time i ate the blue cheese, i put on 2 kg overnight.

Dell'anima
CONTENT
Last night, I had dinner with my friend Bianca, who always picks great places to eat. Dell'anima is another to add to that list. I always love open kitchens and I was particularly impressed that the waitress offered Bianca a taste of two different wines before selecting which one she wanted.The Lily Confit Bruschetta is a mix of garlic, onions, and shallots, slow cooked in olive oil. It's pretty light and didn't impress me that much, but I did like that the slices of bread were thick and toasted.The other pasta was Pizzoccheri, a type of Tagliatelle, made with buckwheat. This pasta included a generous amount of juicy Berkshire Pork and some cubes of potato (unnecessary). Like the other pasta, it looked like a small plate, and tasted pretty light, but was quite filling. I think they are a bit richer than they seem.

Chris at FoodProof has posted a great article on Japanese vs. French vs. Chinese knives, approaches, and selections.

It seems like Chris shares our approach to thinking, although we don't settle for just one knife system

Ooooh, nice article. eGullet also has an awesome tutorial on knife sharpening and maintenance. http://forums.egullet.org/index.php?showtopic=26036Just out of curiosity, what type of knife do you prefer? What's your go-to knife for day-to-day cooking?I use my inexpensive chinese cleaver for almost all of my daily cooking. It can do even the most delicate tasks superbly. My Shun santoku has gotten pretty dull and so has fallen out of favor (it used to be my workhorse knife).I have my eye on the Misono UX-10. I think that will be my next big knife purchase.

Sushi Yasuda #22

I'm so glad we went to Sushi Yasuda last night. We were able to try the rarely available Botan Ebi (shrimp) and it's roe. The Botan Ebi is larger than the sweet shrimp you usually see raw. It is similar in flavor but the large fleshy piece makes a textural difference, feeling more robust in your mouth. The roe is an amazing color, like dark red coral, very firm and surprisingly mild. Go try it ASAP. I don't know how long they'll have it.

Gina - It's all relative I guess.  When I was a kid, for me, eating caviar was one of the most special treats on earth!  But it wasn't any particular thing my mom did, because my sister wouldn't go near it with a ten foot pole.So to me, that ebi roe looks like absolute heaven.Separately, if you don't find it appealing, but you are curious, this would be the best roe to start with.  It is much lighter and crisper, while less juicy than most other caviar I've had.  Which would make it ideal for someone's first try.

Chicken Marsala with Portobello Mushrooms
CONTENT
Chicken Marsala was one of my favorites in college and I realized it's been years since I've eaten it. One reason is that Lon didn't eat mushrooms till recently and I eat most of my dinners with him. I got uber excited today when I realized I could make Chicken Marsala for him to try. Most recipes use chicken breast but I hate white meat so this one is made with dark meat. I also used portobellos instead of the normal white button mushrooms because I happened to have them in my fridge.Chicken Marsala with Portobello Mushrooms~3 servings1. Lay the chicken thighs on a cutting board. Do not overlap. Lay a piece of plastic wrap on top and pound the chicken.2. Place the flour on a shallow dish and stir in a little salt and pepper. Dip the chicken in the flour until all surface area is covered and dust off excess.3. Heat oil in a large skillet on medium high heat. Lay chicken flat, without overlapping, in the skillet and cook for 2 minutes on each side. Remove to a plate and set aside.4. Add butter and onion to the skillet and stir until butter melts. Add mushrooms, season with salt and pepper, and stir continuously until cooked through, about 3 minutes.5. Add chicken broth and marsala and bring to a boil. Push mushrooms over and put the chicken back into the pan and cook for 5 minutes. Flip the chicken and cook for another 3 minutes, or until sauce has thickened to your liking. Serve over pasta or rice.This dish was very comforting for me but Lon wasn't so happy about giant pieces of mushrooms. (It's still bothering him psychologically.) Yet, he still ate a giant plate of it, which says a lot.

The Lite Choice
CONTENT
16 Tasti-D-Lite locations have morphed into The Lite Choice (TLC). They claim to be organic, kosher, low-calorie, and still have those frequent flyer cards. There's one on the ground floor of our apartment building and when it was Tasti-D, I hadn't gone in years. (I avoid highly processed foods with too many chemicals and some flavors have a bad after-taste.)So, no corn syrup and other artificial stuff, seams like a step up. The big question: how does it taste? I tried a few flavors and Peanut Butter and \"Original\" (vanilla) are very weak. The flavor is barely there. Dark Chocolate Truffle is decent and Caramel is good although it tastes more like a Butter Pecan. So far I'm liking TLC more than Tasti-D but I probably won't be buying this one much either. I still prefer the rich and heavily caloric stuff.

i'm going to have to present an opposing viewpoint to 'jessica@foodmayhem'.tlc is some pretty good stuff.  it's definitely 'lite', but i think the majority of people who eat it actually want that...i don't understand why you would come here and complain that it's exactly what it says that it is...people who enjoy it get the taste of ice cream without the heaviness and more importantly the calories...granted i can make something similar to it at home with a blender but i can be just so lazy sometimes...and i would also disagree with the point you make about the food-obsessed not being interested in this product...i think the true food-obsessed are inherently interested in what food does to the body...i don't know you from adam or lauren, but most of the truly food-obsessed people also tend to take care of their bodies and what goes into it...that's great if you go around eating tons of ice cream every night but calories are calories and unless you're on the treadmill for hours a day it's gonna show...i'm definitely food-obsessed but i'm also health obsessed and all vanity aside i look great and ripped and i'm middle-aged and i eat this stuff very regularly and happily...it fulfills a need in my life, and i still indulge in great and wonderful food (including TLC!) as well...

Anonymous, thank you for your comments. I don't think it is all that opposing. I did say there is a market for TLC (and we're glad you find enjoyment in it). It's just not me, who likes more flavor and a more luxurious mouth feel to the ice cream.Also, I guess food obsessed may not be clear as people obsess in different ways. If you are truly seeking out the BEST (and I am picky) tasting foods out there, TLC is not it. However, it has different benefits to those who want low calorie ice cream and convenience.BTW, I am super fit and healthy...marathon, triathlon, former professional figure skater...

Jessica,There is no question that TLC The Lite Choice is not ice cream.  Ice cream is filled with cream, fat, calories, sugar, artificial flavors and preservatives, none of which are in The Lite Choice and all of which are designed to create the mouth feel you seem to seek in your life.You stated The Lite Choice is not the BEST.  Pleae advise what you think is the BEST and I will try it.  That way I can have a better understanding of your palate and how credible your comments are.I agree with the previous anonymous who referred to TLC as wonderful food.  Although I remain anonymous, you can find me every day and sometimes twice a day at  The Lite Choice.  I love it and they are popping up everywhere.  I have tried just about every other product that is less of everything bad and more great flavors and for me, TLC is the BEST by far.ps...you might want to try it again and get used to it.  200 Stone Cold stores are closing and that's probably one of your favorites.I am proud of you for keeping super fit and healthy...marathon, triathlon, former professional figure skater...I would settle for any one of those.

Anonymous, TLC calls their product ice cream (although they shouldn't) and ice cream doesn't necessarily contain artificial flavors and preservatives.As I mentioned in a previous comment, I like the Van Leeuwen Ice Cream Truck. Hmm, oh, and La Salle too, and no Cold Stone is not one of my favorites.Whether something is popular or not doesn't give it credibility in my eyes because there is a large market for diet foods, which means it's popular, but it doesn't mean it tastes better. Sugar substitutes, fat free cheese, diet soda, and putting skim milk in coffee (and the list goes on) are all big sellers. They do not taste better, or good for that matter.But again, that you like it is great for you. Doesn't eating that much of it cost a lot though?

This is a great treat and I have it daily. I get hot fudge sundae 2 to 3 times a week and sometimes more. I LOVE their all natural Peanut Butter as well. It’s made fresh right from the machine (they don’t use peanut butter syrup which has preservatives in it).

I find it pretty remarkable that people will post comments pretending to be an average consumer when they are in fact from the company we've written about.  Perhaps it's not obvious to all readers, but since we read dozens of comments per day, we are quite good at recognizing who is from a company and who isn't.So, a few of the recent "anonymous" posters and nick78, you clearly are involved with TLC.  We're happy to have you commenting here, as long as you accurately identify yourself.  You are only fooling yourself anyway.For an example of a beneficial and interesting comment, check out "bj.emerson"'s comment.  He has identified that he works with Tasti D-Lite and provided good feedback to the community. Thank you BJ!Back to anony-nick, next time, please try to avoid the deception and just be helpful, everyone will be happier in the end.- The Management

I don’t know what company you work for or represent "Lon", but why are they spending time and money to search blogs and analyze who wrote what and why.  Obviously this specific blog is in favor of The Lite Choice, and it bugs you a lot. People like me and others are looking for a better product, and want to blog about it. Your comments are rude and offensive not just to me but to any other blogger who would like to share their thoughts and experiences with others. I think it is pretty clear that it is YOU who is working for another company. Why else do anonymous and my comments bug you so much? I guess it’s obvious.-Not the Management

I think the discussion about tasti vs. tlc is great.  unfortunately, it's really a discussion of tasti vs. tasti and franchise vs. individual ownership.  tasti d lite had always been an agreement between retailer and product supplier to sell the product and be able to use the name.  when tasti was bought up by those intending on franchising the brand, the individual owners were left with the choice of converting their stores or losing the name and product that they had been dispensing for some as long as 18 years!  The creator of TLC was one of these owners who had numeral tasti locations.  when faced with the option of going at it alone or paying up to the man, he decided for the former.  with his knowledge he created a product that fills the same niche as tasti, but uses an organic base, no corn syrup, and some (not all) organic flavors.  The concept of tasti is still there, but just with a twist.  If it's better is a matter of opinion.  better for you, yes, but with the exception that its about 25 calories and ounce instead of 20.  For those seeking the creaminess and fullness of traditional hard ice cream won't find it with tasti or tlc, because that's not what they are.  They are basically ice skim milk.  thats it.I think the recent sprouting of frozen yogurt stores in nyc is truly amazing.  between pink berry, red mango, yolato, 16 handles, etc., the market is over saturated with fro yo.  tasti and tlc still stand out as NOT BEING frozen yogurt.  They are soft serve, but thats the only similarity they share with this new wave of frozen dessert.  I give props to TLC.  i will say that despite it being a chain, the simple fact is is that no two stores will be the same.  flavors in one might be better than flavors in another.  Simply being a licensed retailer of a product does not ensure that the product or machines are being maintained for optimal results.  A franchise often enforces these regulations and hence more consistency from store to store.

Wine and Roses

After a lovely Sunday afternoon stroll through Central Park, my friends and I relaxed with a bottle of wine and a selection of cheeses at Wine and Roses Wine and Roses. We snagged some outdoors seating where we could sit with Angie's dog, Casper, and my pooch, Ice. The weather was perfect for a girls day out.While my girl friends are wine lovers, I really wanted a hot cup of coffee. Alas, they didn't offer that and cappuccinos were $7. Geez! We asked the waiter to suggest a Suavignon Blanc and he recommended a favorite of is for $65. We asked for one in the $40 range and he didn't seem to have any other ideas, just flipped through the menu and found one at that price. We agreed and ordered a three cheese plate, choosing English Blackstick Blue, Morbier, and Castel Rosso. (The first two are in my list of favorites.) It came with a nice array of fruit and 3 slices of bread, decently laid out, but with inadequate utensils to eat with.

Ocean Jewel
CONTENT
For Xiu's birthday, we gathered in Flushing for some Dim Sum at Ocean Jewel Ocean Jewel. The dishes here were a little hit or miss for me, my main complaint being that some dishes were served at room temperature or cooler.We were a party of 12 so we got pics of some, missed others, and I didn't eat every dish. I can only point out a few of my favorites and a few of my not-so-favorites. I loved the Roast Pork Pastries (triangular). These were served warm, flaky, and plumply stuffed with sweet and savory meat. I wasn't impressed with their shrimp or beef wrapped in rice noodles, mainly because the noodles didn't have that bounce these are known for. Surprisingly, a dish of rice noodle chunks with pork ribs on top did have that lovely bounce, playful and flavorful.We had more than described here (chicken feet, egg tarts, taro cake, roast pork buns baked and fried, shu mai, more I can't remember) but we left without being completely full and headed across the street to Flushing Mall for a few more bites. I shared Taiwanese Oyster Noodle Soup and Taiwanese Pork and Fish Paste with Bean Thread Noodle Soup with a few friends and filled up nicely.

Home-made Tortillas
CONTENT
Lon made that orgasmic Pequin Pepper Sauce and soft tacos seemed like an ideal way to use it. I must have been feeling daring because we made tortillas from scratch. Doughs are one of the hardest segments of cooking/baking and we haven't made tortillas ourselves before and we don't have a tortilla press. This first try turned out better than expected, actually quite impressive. This is a combination of recipes I put together from reading about tortillas on-line and it yields a dough that is very easy to roll out super thin. There is great elasticity and the taste of fresh tortillas will make you question ever using store-bought tortillas again.Fresh Home-made Tortillas~makes 16-18 small tortillas1. In a large bowl, mix together bread flour, all purpose flour, and salt. Use your fingers to rub in shortening until the flour looks a little lumpy. Make a well in the center and add boiling water. Stir with a fork until even and start kneading with your hands. Add an additional tablespoon of hot water if it doesn't come together. Kneading on a floured surface until the dough is smooth and no longer sticky.2. Make golf-sized balls and lay out on a tray. Cover with a damp paper towel and let it rest for 2 hours.3. Heat a large cast iron pan on medium high heat. Place the oil in a small dish and use a paper towel to wipe a thin layer on the cast iron pan. Roll out each ball one at a time and place on heated pan. (I wasn't able to make them perfectly round but that doesn't effect the taste.)4. Cook until you see a bubble form and flip it over (less than 1 minute).5. Cook for 30 seconds-1 minutes, or until it puffs a little. Remove from pan.6. Repeat with remaining dough.We really loved this meal and will probably be making our own tortillas from now on.

Pequin Pepper Sauce
CONTENT
Wandering through the farmer's market yesterday, Jessica and I were discussing whether or not grapes were in the berry family. The answer is yes. If you didn't already know Jessica loves berries. Then, as if the universe was calling to us a moment later we found ourselves in front of a beautiful stand of chili peppers (one of MY favorite types of berries). They had a huge selection of Pennsylvania-grown chilis, including some Pequins -- yum. We bought five and home we went for me to start cooking.Pequins are supposedly 7-8 times spicier than jalapenos. However, they seem to be sweeter and are much more flavorful. Interestingly, just yesterday I was discussing with Marcos about how sweeter peppers seem to make the heat much more tolerable. This sauce is perfect for even for a non-pepper-lover.I was inspired by the sauce at Mexicana Mama Centro and felt I could do a bit better. Whoa did I! Following Jessica's advice, I tried to keep an accurate recipe this time. Let's see how I did...Pequin Pepper Sauce ~makes roughly 1/2 cupIngredientsInstructionsAs they are roasting, put the vinegar, honey, and onion powder in a blender and spin it once. Let the onion powder dissolve.Jessica was wowed (which means I got kisses, sweet deal). It tasted damn good. Right off the bat, I made a turkey burger, toasted a bun, and slathered it with the sauce. It was amazing!

Bradley, thanks for the comment... you might be right!  To be frank, I'm not sure.  The stand in the farmer's market only sold peppers, and the clerk told us they were piquins.  That said, amazingly, I can not confirm online or not.  I agree that all the other piquins seem to be the tiny kind, perhaps this is some related variety?  Or perhaps the clerk was just wrong?I tried to figure out what other chili variety these might be, but I can't find them.If anyone knows for sure, please reach out!

For some, 60 degrees F is still pretty warm. I see people out without jackets, some even in shorts. I, on the other hand, am deathly afraid of the cold and rain. I basically start preparations for hibernating around now and become home-bound by 50 degrees F. This is when I start consuming lots of soup, so here's the first one of the season, Turkey Meatball Soup. I made the meatballs very garlicky, which combined with chicken broth is the way to keep away colds, or vampires, or your blind date. HahaTurkey Meatball Soup~roughly 10 servingsmeatballs1. Heat a large dutch oven over high flame. Add the bacon and stir until it gives off fats.2. Stir in the leek and onion and cook for 2 minutes. Stir in carrots and cook for another 2 minutes. Add broth and water and bring to a boil.3. Reduce to a simmer and cover. Cook for 45 minutes, stirring occasionally.4. While the soup is cooking, make the meatballs. Mix ground meat with bread crumbs, onion, garlic, and egg. Season with salt and pepper. Form 1 1/2″ balls (makes about 43).5. Heat a large skillet with the vegetable oil and brown the meatballs on all sides (they don't need to be cooked through). Place them in the soup and bring to a boil. Reduce to a simmer and cook covered for another 20 minutes. Serve hot.Note: This can be kept in the fridge for about a week and can be frozen for about 2 months. It actually tastes better the next day.

Tofu Salad with Spicy Sesame Dressing
CONTENT
As usual, I'm not giving amounts for the salad cause you can use more or less of whatever you want. The recipe for the dressing is given though. I start with green salad bowl leaf lettuce and radicchio travesio. In Asian style salads, I like to use blanched carrots. (Just julienne the carrots and throw them in boiling water for a few seconds and then rinse them under cool water.) They have a great bright orange color and are just a bit more tender. I also julienne some seedless cucumbers, and then add my baked tofu chunks on top.The fresh ginger in the dressing ads a nice kick.Spicy Sesame Dressing

Inside the Despana Basket: Valor Chocolate a la Taza
CONTENT
It's been a while since we talked about our Despana basket. There's only a couple of items left and we were waiting for cooler weather to have the Chocolate a la Taza. They call it Spanish Drinking Chocolate but it's what we call Hot Chocolate.I followed the instructions on the back, 40 grams of chocolate per cup of milk (whole milk of course), stirred in and brought to a boil. The flavor is good, although I prefer darker. It coats your mouth nicely, and it was exactly what I was craving, enjoying it to the last drop. It didn't have an immediate after taste, but a few minutes after finishing the cup, there was a little bit of a taste that I wanted to wash out. I've got to make some marshmallows next time.

While wandering around a mall in Chicago, we found Oil & Vinegar, a chain that hasn't made it to NY yet. (Sadly, our flabbergasting rent prices really keep out innovative new companies.) They sell, of course, oil and vinegar, and other imported sauces and condiments, a few crackers, and a few containers or serving items. We love that you can sample most of the oils and vinegars, and you purchase by volume. You choose from a variety of bottles, which you purchase the first time, and then you can bring them back for refills.After sampling several different oils, we decided on Bonsecco, a strong full-bodied olive oil. We chose the bottle that seemed best to travel with (tightest lid).We also bought a little salt/condiment dish with spoon just cause it was so cute. We thought it would be perfect for serving specialty salts.Last but not least, we bought a sweet vinegar, infused with carob. It reminds me of a good balsamic because it's strong and needs nothing but a little oil to top salad.The Carob Vinegar and Bonsecco Olive Oil were fantastic on a salad of greens, beets, tomato, and gala apples (all farmer's market).

Bison Burgers with Apple Smoked Salt
CONTENT
Lon picked up some Apple Smoked Salt (Maine Sea Salt Co.) at The City Bakery today. Yea, weird that they sell this, but we're still glad. It's amazing stuff. The scent is so strong that you could just leave the container open on a table to appetize the senses.I thought the salt would be great for Bison Burgers (or any burger). I mixed the meat with finely chopped onion, and roasted jalapenos (from Lon's mom's garden), seasoned with freshly ground pepper and the Apple Smoked Salt. The result is a wonderful burger that screams BBQ!

We were out looking at apartments again last night and by the time we were done, it was way past our normal dinner time. We were starving and a resident in the building recommended a place about a block away, so we scurried over to V & T Pizzeria and Restaurant. It's an old school Italian place that looks like it's been around for a while. The supermarket quality bread and toppings on the table let you know not to expect too much.

After breakfast at Toast Two, we stepped into a little shop a few doors down, Virtu Virtu. They have stationary, jewelry, and gifts, but more importantly for us, they have great things for foodies. Lon and I really loved everything in this shop, including the owner, Julie, who is really helpful. She's more of a curator (her shop is just gorgeous and impeccably organized) than a store owner, and the reason we're sharing this is because you can order from her, online.We bought a bread board, made from the most beautiful wood (Birdseye Maple), smooth, and perfect to use or just display on your wall. (It comes with a matching wooden peg to hang on.) We picked up 8 silicone placemats that look so elegant, yet can be cleaned with a wet towel. Lon couldn't resist buying a decorative hide box for Kasi, and if we weren't planning on moving, I would've bought vases, mugs, napkin holders, and everything else.

Honey Apple Bundt Cake
CONTENT
I made this cake to bring for Rosh Hashana, so the key flavors were apples and honey. I used roughly 1/4 cup bass wood honey and 1/2 cup buckwheat honey. The buckwheat is a very dark, stronger flavored honey, which will likely impact the flavor. Yes, I'm trying to say, don't use cheap honey.Honey Apple Bundt Cake1. Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (300 degrees F for convection). Grease and flour a 9 inch Bundt pan.2. In a medium sized bowl, stir together flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, and allspice. Set aside.3. In a large bowl , stir together sugar and oil. Beat in the eggs until batter is light, looks like lemon curd. Stir in honey and vanilla.4. Fold flour mixture in just until moistened. Fold apples in gently. It doesn't need to be completely even.5. Pour into prepared pan and bake for 50-65 minutes, or until toothpick comes out clean. Cool for 15 minutes in the pan before removing.6. Cool completely, dust with powdered sugar, serve.This cake comes out incredibly moist. If you use a dark honey, the dark batter will alternate with the shredded apple, creating a almost zebra-like look. Everyone had seconds or thirds and seemed to really like this cake. It was such an easy cake to make and travels well, and left-over's are great for breakfast the next day.

Lou Malnati's Lou Malnati's has several locations. Luckily, one is just a few blocks from our hotel. Good thing we didn't make a long drive for this one. All four of us thought it stunk!Starting with the Stuffed Spinach Bread, it looks so damn good, especially when you cut it open and the cheese oozes out. There was no spinach flavor though, just green stuff that looked like pesto mixed into the not-so-great processed cheese. The shell/crust, whatever you want to call it, was hard and crunchy.

Attention, tourists: If you put ketchup on a hot dog, like clams on your pizza or think provel is an acceptible cheese to put on a pizza, or have only had the experience of a chain restaurant like pizza hut, then you need to spend a little more time working on developing your tastebuds for the culinary experience of chicago deep dish pizza. Anyone else from Chicago who hates Lou's must either be secretly from New York or have an unreasonably lousy sense of taste.

I expected Moto Moto to be more gadgety, maybe more scientific. The website doesn't really reflect how comical and playful their food is. It was fun and almost childish, allowing adults to play with our food. Right from the beginning, your menu is presented on an edible butter cracker with a dollop of marscapone, a perfectly cooked asparagus, and asparagus puree. The cracker was too salty for me but so fun to eat.The palette cleanser was scenic beach set up, with an edamame ice cream, a star fish made of apple puree, frozen raspberry rocks (that rocked), and a liquid ball of lightly curried coconut liquid.On a side note, the restaurant is located in what seems like the meat packing district. As you walk in and out, it smells like rotting meat, which isn't very appetizing.

I love to hear peoples' reactions to an experimental cuisine restaurant. The road kill was too much. My boyfriend would have thought that was the most genius thing. Moto really pushes the limits with that dish...in a good way. But a chef still needs to be aware of harmonizing. It seemed a little lacking (in finesse and taste) ...Maybe he is just having too much fun making his customers cringe, laugh and delight.

We waited on a 40 minute (roughly) line to eat at Hot Doug's Hot Doug's, a kitschy place with a pretty impressive menu. Doug's offers lots of different meats (one vegetarian dog) and several toppings and a wide range of prices. Of course we wanted to try the Chicago-style Dog with \"everything\" (pickle, relish, mustard, tomato, caramelized onions). We didn't realize that the relish (you can see a bit on the right side) would be radioactive green, which means food coloring, so I couldn't eat it. I took a bite from the other side though and I wasn't missing much. Other than the poppy seed bun being really soft and fluffy, the rest was just very regular. Lon didn't think this was a good representation of Chicago dogs.

sucks to wait so long to end up being disappointed. 40 minutes for hotdogs? Yeah Chicago-style dogs traditionally have the GREEN relish, even at Weinerschnitzels. I find the best dogs are always at the street vendors they count on you coming back. Big places just don't care.

EMC

I forgot that you can't consume food coloring! The strict ingredients for a "Chicago Dog" must include the neon-green relish, which according to my dad, is supposed to distinguish the sweetness of the relish from the savory sour of the pickle spear (kind of a feast for the eyes and the mouth). This is news to me since I always assumed we Chicagoans just dyed everything neon green...like the Chicago River on St. Patty's Day. Sport peppers absolutely must be on a Chicago dog, and I'm wish the davis', the street vendors really make the best.If it's made properly, you should taste every ingredient on the dog each time you take a bite.

This morning, we went to Meli Cafe & Juice Bar, had one of the best breakfasts ever, and I'm debating going back tomorrow. They had so many awesome things on the menu that if I lived in Chicago, I would be a loyal regular.They make their own marmalades... I loved both the strawberry and apricot, and their whipped honey butter is even better. It's ultra light with a touch of honey and you could seriously eat this in spoonfuls.

The price is right and the food is great here. They offer healthy veggie or sweet crepes, sandwiches, and a huge selection of homemade soups. They also have a full, freshly squeezed juice bar.-----------SallySocial Advertising

I haven't been able to find a breakfast restaurant in Chicago that really satisfies me with out upsetting my stomach. This restaurant always has the BEST food. Grits (not lumpy or dry or runny, just right), biscuits (never hard and always perfectly grilled, yes I said grilled), EGGS (not swimming in oil never bitter or over/under cooked), Gravy (it's just perfect), breakfast burritos (made with Charrizo, sorry about the spelling). It's just fantastic, my Dad took me there for the first time in January. It's our tradition to go out for breakfast every weekend and he took me there. I was skeptical because it wasn't in the neighborhood (I live in Bucktown) but it was well worth the hop skip and jump. Tomorrow take your family there for a quiet and wonderful breakfast. Take North Ave. West to Hamlin then go left, go south on Hamlin till you hit Grand then go right, drive a couple blocks and your there! I think they serve Dinner too!==========================mikemathewSEO

Alinea
CONTENT
Alinea Alinea.Exec chef Grant Achatz calls the food \"ultra modern emotional\"The space is clean and modern, very Tribeca, with comfy seats and a spacious table.We made reservations about two months in advance and this dinner was highly anticipated. Surprisingly, we came out with such differing opinions that we decided to write this post jointly.Steelhead RoeCoconut mousse (?) topped with salmon roe, encased in a candy cilantro tuile. Served on the end of a vanilla bean.Jessica: This is one of the three that knocked my socks off. As soon as you pick it up (like a lollipop), you get a whiff of vanilla. The thin candy tuile breaks delicately and your mouth fills with the roe juices, mixing with some light coconut.Lon: This was an exciting presentation that set the bar for the meal. Two bars were set though. The presentation bar was set extremely high. It seemed so delicate yet held together perfectly; it was playful and inventive. The presentation, led smoothly to the aroma, and then finally a mismatch of taste. The second bar, of flavor, was set very low. The overly sweet tuile stuck to my teeth and didn't blend with the salty roe. I found the dish unenjoyable to eat. However, the technical competence to produce it was remarkable.ButterCertain dishes were paired with breads, and two types of butter were given: a goat cream-based butter and cow's cream-based butter with lava salt.Jessica: I liked both, incredibly smooth and milky. The goat cream butter was more distinct though.Lon: Both were amazing, I've never had any like the goat butter. I preferred the cow butter, particularly due to the salt.TomatoTomato flavor presented in many textures including gelees, crisps, diced cubes, etc. Served with basil sorbet, frozen mozzarella foam, and olive oil.Jessica: This was a very interesting play on familiar flavors in unfamiliar textures. The whole thing was very light and airy, refreshing, I'm not sure how we don't have a pic of this one but it looked like a piece of art with white coral and colored cubes here and there.Lon: The frozen foam was remarkable: light as air, yet coating my mouth as heavy as cream. It was a dish in and of itself. The playful use of tomato was really enjoyable, even though tomato gelee doesn't do it for me.CauliflowerFive coatings (?), three gels, apple soup. A rich apple-flavored soup with various textured elements of cheese, nuts, etc. topped with a super thin sliver of dried cauliflower.Jessica: This was the second of my three favorites. The warm apple soup was poured on at the table. I imagine it's so that the different cubes didn't get soggy. There were nutty ones and cheesy ones, each crunchy on the outside to different degrees, softer on the inside. Little pieces of fried cauliflower and a dehydrated cross section garnish the dish. The simplified way to describe it would be a warm soup with different flavored croutons. It was comforting and just a wonderful combination of flavors.Lon: This was my favorite dish of the night, I easily could've finished a big ole bowl of the soup, especially with a bunch of those various crouton-like cubes of varying tastes in it. The cheese one and the nutty ones were absolutely astounding.LobsterPopcorn essence in a solidified sauce, clarified butter in a sphere, curry accents over nuts and lobster pieces. Mango-Lime gelee with pepper.Jessica: This was described to us as \"things that go with butter.\" The lobster was cooked perfectly, no complaints, but nothing stood out to me here.Lon: With the exception of the mango, which seemed odd and out-of-place (but still tasted delicious by itself), this plate was masterful. The sphere of butter was so playful, adding to the whimsy of solid popcorn sauce, which by the way, really tasted like popcorn. The lobster did nothing special, but the various other elements were great. I cleared this plate, and thought that it's only downside was that there was an unpopped corn kernel on the plate which hurt my teeth.Wagyu BeefAfter arriving frozen via liquid nitrogen (standing as a centerpiece through a few courses), the thawed wagyu slice is placed over a fried maitake mushroom set in a smoked date sauce, then topped with a blis elixir dressing and edible flower.Jessica: First off, I love Wagyu Beef! The only reason this didn't make my favorites is because Wagyu Beef with mushroom and a vinegary drizzle is pretty familiar.Lon: This was a fun dish. I'm not sure the wagyu's arrival and on-table defrosting made any sense, but it was entertaining and did become a conversation topic, as it likely does for every table. I loved the fried (maybe?) mushroom with the beef. The paste it sat upon was incredibly rich, too strong for the dish, perhaps about 1/3rd the amount would've been perfect.Hot PotatoHot and cold potato pieces topped with a slice of black truffle drop into a pool of potato soup that arrives in a small wax cup, by releasing a pin.Jessica: I just don't like cold soups, especially such rich ones, so this wasn't for me. The potato p ieces were cooked perfectly though.Lon: To me, this tasted like almost raw potato in a pool of cream, which is fine, but nothing noteworthy. This was the first time, that I recall, I ate black truffle, and it did nothing for me. Sorry pigs and dogs. While Justin, Jessica, and I partook from the regular tasting menu, Shayna had the vegetarian tasting. I was upset that they delivered this dish twice as two separate courses to her. She wouldn't let me complain to the chef about it though.LambA cube of salt-diet lamb (raised in Pennsylvania) is plated with a large, fried potato nest attached to it. It sits in a puree of sunflower and is joined by a sweet spice mixture that has sunflower petals, sunflower seeds, and other spices and vegetables.Jessica: The lamb was medium-rare, just the way I like it, pairing perfectly with the texture of puree and chunks of vegetable. Execution was excellent but again the dish was familiar. (BTW, I'm not complaining about perfect yet familiar dishes. I think it's wise to have a few more recognizable dishes mixed in.)Lon: The lamb tasted very good, but nothing special (it was just correctly cooked, good quality lamb). What was interesting was how the potato nest was affixed, I can't even describe it. Somehow the potato and lamb were fused. Similar to my issue with the wagyu dish, the paste (sunflower) under the meat was way too strong, totally overwhelming the dish.Black TruffleA single ravioli filled with a black truffle soup sits atop a spoon floating in a hollow plate. A flake of parmesan and cooked romaine rest on top of the ravioli.Jessica: Last but not least of my favorites, I'm not even one to gush about truffles, but this ravioli was the most perfect pasta dough. This spoonful was heaven in one bite.Lon: This was a completely mediocre attempt at fulfilling a soup-dumpling concept. The delivery of the dish was sensational, with the spoon seemingly floating in mid air -- just beautiful.DuckDeconstructed mole dish of duck cube, duck confit, mole, duck gelee, tomatillo, and tortilla dust, served in a glass on a plate. Surrounding the glass are elements of mole (chili, almonds, tortilla, etc.)Jessica: This dish arrived with an army of scents. I was comforted and relaxed by it and the fall colors were beautiful. We weren't instructed how to eat this one so I'm not sure if I did it wrong but my first bite, a large chunk was not favorable, overly spiced (not spicy), throwing me off a bit. The shredded confit underneath was much better.Lon: Let me put it like this: the top half (vertically speaking) of this dish made me want to spit it out; but I forced it down. It was overly nutty and almost burnt tasting. The cube of duck breast did nothing to help. The bottom half succeeded at providing an excellent mole flavor; and it was truly brought to life by the perfect shreds of duck confit.Concord GrapeConcord grape juice filled in a yogurt-based spherical container, topped with the tiniest mint leaf and in a pool of sauce from long pepper. The container bursts as you bite down on it.Jessica: When you break the ball, you get a rush of concord juice, basically liquid candy, which was ok, but then you finish with eating the broken ball, which is like eating wax.Lon: If you love Welch's White Grape Juice, you'll like this dish; unfortunately I don't drink grape juice.TransparencyA sugary sheet made of yogurt and flavored with rose petals and raspberry.Jessica: The very thin sheet allows for the perfect amount of tangy flavor to melt on your tongue.Lon: I'd say this was the winner of the evening. A remarkably perfect execution of flavor and texture.WatermelonA cube of watermelon, with coriander and tamari (soy sauce) accents and bonito atop floats on the end of a wire bobbing in front of you. It is intended to be eaten off the wire with no hands and in a single bite.Jessica: I like bonito and I like watermelon, but I guess not together.Lon: And for me, this was probably the loser of the evening, although closely tied with the pumpkin dish below. The fish and soy flavor simply does not match watermelon. The three of us who ate it seemed to be in agreement on this one.BaconA single strip of bacon with a zig-zag of butterscotch and shreds of apple and thyme leaves. It arrives dangling from a tight rope.Jessica: This just wasn't as good as I expected it to be. The bacon was a little too light and I guess I'm spoiled by Lon's slow cooked maple basted bacon.Lon: I'm a bacon fan, plain and simple. I've eaten it as a lollipop, covered in syrup, heck even covered in white chocolate. But apparently Alinea couldn't get it right. This strip of bacon tasted exactly the same as the cheap container of \"Bac-Os\" from the supermarket.PumpkinA large pillow is delivered to the table with smoke, scented with autumn aromas, wafting from it. The wavy plate is placed on top of the pillow with a cylinder of pumpkin mousse, filled with soft gruyere. A smear Blis maple syrup is applied along the plate, along the plate are dollops of various flavors, such as rum.Jessica: We were told to mix the stuff together, which in over simplified explanation, I'll call a deconstrcted parfait. Soft smooth pumpkin, cheese, and maple, some crunchy stuff, felt like eating something like a yogurt and granola or cereal type thing. A few bites had some strong rum which were too strong for me. The dish itself would've been nothing impressive but it was served on big white pillows that really set an entire atmosphere. You could see the curls of smoke coming up and smell the cabin and fireplace, which turned an ordinary dessert into a fall retreat.Lon: Ok so this was the loser dish. I could not eat more than two bites. Each flavor was WAY too strong, overwhelming. Justin commented that he ate it by combining all the parts so that they balanced out a bit. I tried that but it seemed a bit like turning up the radio to drown out sirens. It's still too loud. I left over 90% of the dish and got a nasty look from the waiter when he cleared it.ChocolateA soft sheet of ganache, cocoa powder, a fennel (?) ice cream, fruit jams, and a slice of fig. On the other half of the plate is a pool of pine-flavored cream with olive tapanade.Jessica: My picture does not do justice to how beautiful this plate was, such a piece of art. The flavors were only ok to me. The chocolate ganache sheet, the most prevalent part was a disappointing chocolate to me because it was very regular. The pool of cream with olive tapenade (luckily on the side) was disgusting to me.Lon: It seems pretty hard to screw up a plate of chocolate, but Alinea did. The ganache was mediocre and the ice cream was nasty (although that was more of a personal preference than an execution issue), and the pine soup was nothing interesting, albeit unusual. I give them credit for producing an absolute work of art, but sometimes it's better to look at art than eat it.Dry CaramelA powder of caramel in a shot glass. As the powder hits your tongue it becomes chewy, salty caramel.Jessica: Interesting but quite salty. I'm not a huge caramel person anyway.Lon: I had more fun pouring water into the shot to see what might happen, then I did putting the dust in my mouth. Have you had \"Astronaut Ice Cream\"? This is Astronaut Caramel, nifty for the kids, but not delicious. I'm not a fan of salty caramel.SummaryLon: Alinea stinks. Sound harsh? It should for the price. I found the service inconsistent: at times down to earth and cool; while at other times snooty and pretentious. The food was beautiful throughout, but totally sacrificed flavor for experimentation. As I repeated throughout the evening to my friends, at the end of the day, taste is the most critical factor in food. Everything else is secondary. This food was not delicious. Weird and experimental: sure. Delicious: no (with the few exceptions I mentioned, such as the great apple soup). My advice to the chef: don't deconstruct a dish if you can't put it back together again.Jessica: Ok, I have to agree that for how expensive it was ($220 per person), I expected more of the dishes to be incredibly delicious and really only a few were. However, this was certainly an experience and I like that the Chef himself describes his cuisine as \"emotional\". Like art, each dish carried me through a story, or feeling, or evoked my senses differently. I did also find the service inconsistent so I'm a bit torn about Alinea. I really did enjoy my evening, but for the first time ever, it wasn't really about the flavors. It was really just the whole experience, like being at Disney World for the first time.

Actually I thought it looked like a lot of food - do they offer a wine pairing?While the meal was expensive, at least you can really tell there was a lot of work put into each dish, and (I imagine) that the ingredients were high end in order to work with his style.  Too bad more of the flavors didn't work because it looks gorgeous and fun.

So this was the tasting right, not the tour? I'm still shocked that they served the potato dish for the veg tasting twice. That's a pretty big gaffe, and the staff should've known about the error. Hopefully, Moto's menu will be better.

We kind of changed the schedule around a bit and ended up at Bob Chinn's Crabhouse Bob Chinn's Crabhouse for lunch today. We weren't that hungry after our late and massive breakfast so seafood ended up being a nice light choice.We started with Blue Point Oysters, large, fresh, and juicy. Some were a bit sandy though and two were not flipped.Thanks to everyone who voted for Bob Chinn's. We were definitely very pleased!

Walker Brothers The Original Pancake House
CONTENT
Several years ago my family and I attempted to share breakfast together at Walker Brothers The Original Pancake House in Wilmette, IL Walker Brothers. After a fiasco there (long story) we ended up elsewhere and I didn't get my pancakes. During this trip, it was critical that we eat some of those famous pancakes, and we did!Jessica hung about the hotel room this morning while I slept in, until a late 8:30am CST, which is very late for me. After slowly getting myself together, we got in our rental car and started driving. It was about 30 minutes driving, but fortunately there was no line. That doesn't mean it wasn't busy. Even at 9:45am(ish) they were doing quite a bit of business and handling it very well. Heck, even before we got to open the menus we were drinking our coffee and tea.In an interesting change, Jessica already knew what she wanted to eat -- the Apple Pancakes. Walker Bros. is famous for these treats and they are impressive. We'll come back to that. I carefully read through the menu and then asked the waiter for a suggestion amongst the classic pancakes. He said the blueberry and the banana were the two most popular. I selected the Banana Pancakes; we also ordered a side of hashbrowns and bacon.Have you ever seen the movie \"Defending Your Life\"? Through the stay in Judgement City the citizens can eat anything they want, as much as they want, and the food is picturesque, always tastes great, and is ready almost instantly. Well, this is about as close as I've ever gotten to that dream. Our food was ready almost instantly! It seemed as if they turned around and had it in hand.The Apple Pancake set down on our table and the table almost collapsed under the shear weight. It was about nine inches across and two inches tall, steaming hot, piled with apples, and gooey with brown sugar and cinnamon. It was exactly what we thought it would be, although much sweeter than Jessica had hoped. The taste was like that of a giant cinnamon bun, filled with apples. No matter how hard she tried, Jessica just could not eat the whole thing, although partly because it was too sweet for her.My stack of pancakes was laid out in a perfect pinwheel with a large dollop of whipped, milky butter in the center. The waiter was incredibly thoughtful and let me know that many people request the Tangerine Suzette Sauce on the side, I thought that sounded like a wise idea and it worked out well.These are the best pancakes I ever ordered! I do recall one time my friend's dad made slightly better, but they were never repeated and he wouldn't share the recipe, so I guess those are disqualified since one time could be a fluke Unlike other banana pancakes, the bananas were mashed into the batter, so the flavor was consistent throughout the pancakes. The pancakes were perfectly cooked, moist, and super fluffy. The whipped, sweet butter added just the right touch. Keeping the sauce on the side allowed me to use it on some of the pancakes; use some real maple syrup (not that terrible corn syrup at other places). Jessica felt the pancakes had a bit of a baking powder taste, but I didn't detect it at all. I would order these seven days a week and twice on Sunday.The Hash Browns, were thick shreds of lightly pan fried potatoes with tons of melty cheddar cheese and lots of chunks of ham. My amazement continued, as all our food truly looked exactly the same as in the menu and was so appealing. We were a bit upset that the potatoes themselves were completely underseasoned and slightly undercooked, but that didn't seem to stop us from cleaning the plate.My one complaint about the experience was the bacon. While it was definitely thick-cut, probably cut on location, and likely baked (so that it wasn't greasy) it had no particular flavor other than the cured flavor. It's a bad thing when I don't devour all the bacon in sight.The whole meal was served piping hot, Jessica's coffee cup was refilled constantly, the service was incredibly friendly and helpful (which seems to be a consistent theme around these parts), and the price was good. We particularly liked the masterful way Walker Bros. had staff dedicated to their specific tasks: people just filling coffee; people taking orders; people delivering orders; people at the register; etc. Everything moved along smoothly and quickly, yet we never felt rushed. This is a New Yorker's dream. Sadly there is nothing like this in New York. No place to get a breakfast close to this fast and good and inexpensive.So it took years for me to finally try it, and driving back to Chicago we hit a TON of traffic, but to have a phenomenal breakfast that made me feel like I had died and gone to heaven (or at least Judgement City), it was all worth it.

A couple of years ago, the NYTimes had an article about a pancake house in Florida where every table had it's own electric griddle.  When you sat down, you got a pitcher full of pancake batter and a bunch of different toppings. You basically made your own toppings at your table (kind of like shabu shabu, but  with pancakes).  I think that's brilliant.  BTW, Royal Canadian was good, but this place looks AWESSOME!

They have a location (possibly multiple?) in downtown Chicago too.  I've only been to the one in Wilmette once, and while I don't really remember how good the service was, I can vouch for the one downtown in that their service is incredible!It's always super packed, but the food never takes that long and it's always worth the wait to get in (if you're going on a weekend).If you ever make it back, try the 49er's!

Jessica, after reading this, I realized that the one downtown is just The Original Pancake House, not a Walkers Brothers.  At first, I thought they were two separate restaurants with eerily similar menus, but after checking out the websites of both, I think they are in fact the same restaurant and the ones in the Chicago suburbs are just owned by these Walker Brothers.Anyway, check it out.  Now you can enjoy these delicious pancakes all over the country: http://www.originalpancakehouse.com/locations.html

We had three great breakfasts in Chicago and we didn't wait at any of them.Emily, sadly we didn't have enough time to try out more places. We're now back in NY.Anonymous, funny, I was thinking how great it would be with some pecans.

Of course the apple pancakes are sweet! They're old school, and not meant to appeal to a sophisticated palate. Walker Bros. is no foodie mecca! Just solid, incredibly delicious breakfast fare!

Anonymous, you're right, I hope I didn't imply that it was supposed to be fancy...it's an old school pancake house, which has it's own appeal, but still, I can't take something that sweet, but I did try.

Webster's Wine Bar
CONTENT
Although Lon and I are not drinkers, I was planning on checking out Webster's Wine Bar Webster's Wine Bar and having a glass of wine, but my cold was still bothering me so we stuck to food. Our waitress suggested the Spicy Feta and Piquillo Pepper Tapenade as well as the Calabrian-style Butternut Squash and White Bean Dip. I liked the Spicy Feta and didn't care for the Butternut/White Bean, while Lon decided on the opposite, so we each ended up with our own. They both tasted exactly as described by their ingredients so I guess it's just personal preference.

Gino's East
CONTENT
We're in Chicago!First stop, Gino's East Gino's East. Actually Lou Malnati's was our plan, but we got there and they weren't open. The New Yorker in me didn't realize that any pizza place could be closed for lunch on the weekdays.So the whole place looks like 3-year-olds with crayons and chalk came through.The meal was still great for $38 (including tax and tip). We were full for hours and couldn't go for our planned ice cream stop. The most important thing I noticed was that everything was perfectly seasoned. Foods like these often get too salty and here they really restrained. We enjoyed our coma-inducing (we really had to nap) lunch but I don't believe this is Chicago's best.

Yeah, I've had NY pizza quite a few times, and in fact, I'll be attending a conference in NJ this spring where I'm hoping to find a good sausage pizza. I've always judged the quality of pizza with the quality of the meat in mind first, and I have to say that Lou Malnati's, Uno's, and Gino's have never really hit the spot for me. Falco's, Home Run Inn and Fat Ricky's however... I'm a sucker for the Italian sausage a lot of Chicago pizza joints use since many of them use the kind with big, fat fennel seeds in them. And it never overpowers the pizza. Delish!

Dr. Food, I don't know of any great pizza places in NJ. Will you be coming to NY? I know you're not a big fan of deep dish but I feel like that's the point of eating pizza here. For thin crust, I'll have that back in NY.

As you know from some of our previous trips, when we travel, we eat a lot! Just check out the day we went to Santorini for an example. We really pack it in, even in the airport! So with only four days in Chicago (starting today), and it being Jessica's first time there, we really need to be on top of our game. After all, Chicago cuisine is definitely some of the most enjoyable in the country.We've put together a little quick reference chart to make sure we know where we're heading at each stop along the way. The two restaurants that spurred the whole trip were Moto and Alinea. We booked reservations at those places about two months ago. Almost all the remaining choices were suggestions from you -- our favorite readers!

Archipelago Media Preview
CONTENT
We were invited to Archipelago's Media Preview Archipelago, where we sampled 11 or 12 different signature items that Chef Hisanobu Osaka will be serving at his new restaurant. These were served as hors d'oeuvres so it's hard to say what it would be like to eat at the restaurant, but I hope the kitchen finds their rhythm because a staff of 8 or more (just kitchen) wasn't able to pump out food at a reasonable pace. The packed crowd seemed content without getting much food, loading up on free wine and champagne, but Lon and I, not big drinkers, found ourselves standing around bored most of the time. We were pretty aggressive about snagging pieces as they came out of the open kitchen, but after an hour, we gave up and left. (Sadly, we missed dessert.)Since I still have to finish packing (leaving for Chicago tomorrow morning), I'm going to breeze through these: The Snow Crab Salad was fresh and the Cumin Tuile was a nice touch. The cumin didn't add as much flavor as it did an aroma that filled your olphactory glands.

Peking Duck Forest  (with Food Porn)
CONTENT
We've posted on Peking Duck Forest Peking Duck Forest before, but it was over a year ago, back when we didn't always have a camera with us. You deserve some visuals so, here's our dinner from last night. What stands out about this restaurant is that you can get real Chinese food with service. At most authentic Chinese restaurants, Lon has to ask for ice water 3 times, and you can't make special requests or substitutions. Here, where they have a mix of Chinese and non-Chinese clientele, ice water is always served, wet naps are provided, and the owner remembered that Lon didn't want mushrooms in the dishes.As the name hints at, they do Peking Duck.Lettuce Wraps, which are a mix of pork, shrimp, pine nuts, and other stuff, held in a cup of lettuce, is also served table side. The mixture may not have been evenly mixed because my parents thought it was really salty and the rest of us didn't notice that.

I'm been waiting for the weather to cool down so I could try a hot cup of coffee from Abraco Abraco. I loved their Iced Coffee so much on my first visit, that I was almost giddy as I made the long walk over with Ice (my Jack Russell Terrier). Sadly, it didn't hit that spot for me. I believe it's the same coffee they use for their Iced version. It tastes the same, but somehow that bit of acidity worked in the Iced version but turned me off in the hot version. I'm really bummed because it's such a charming place. I love the energy there. Oh well...I'll be back when the weather warms again.

Crooked Tree Creperie
CONTENT
Almost 7 months ago, Kathleen recommended Crooked Tree Creperie Crooked Tree Creperie, in the comments section of the Cafe Brama post. I can't believe how long it's taken me to go try it but I'm glad I finally did because it's quite good.The crepes are nice and elastic, with lots of choices for fillings, both savory and sweet. Savory orders come with two filled crepes and a small mesculan salad. I ordered Onion, Mushroom, and Mozzarella, a combination that can't go wrong. Tracy got Spinach and Goat Cheese, which was surprisingly flavorful. The spinach was sauteed with garlic and cooked just right (I hate mushy spinach.) Nicole ordered the Smoked Chicken and Goat Cheese which was cleverly shredded so that it could easily be cut through. All of the ingredients were fresh and attention was paid to making sure proportions were right. For $10 and under, the price is appropriate, perfect when you just want something light and simple.When it came to dessert, we didn't know what Creme de Marron was. Our waiter (who was friendly yet chill) was so nice and brought over a sample of the chestnut cream for us to try. We decided on banana and nutella, which was enjoyable but not very memorable for me, possibly because I think their crepe suits savory fillings more, and needs to be more tender for dessert fillings. It's not bad though so if I go for dinner, I'll likely still get dessert.Thanks for the recommendation Kathleen!

Tartine Cookbook
CONTENT
I'm so honored that I won the contest on Manger La Ville, a great blog by Abby, a culinary school student who's living in New York and comes from San Francisco. Can life be better than getting to live/eat in two great cities?What did I win? The \"Tartine\" cookbook! I'm so excited because I went to Tartine when I was in SF and we loved it. The first thing I did, was look for their fabulous Morning Bun, but they didn't give out that secret. =( The cookbook is full of wonderful photos and I love when baking recipes have volume and weight measurements.I was dying to make something from this book, but we're leaving for Chicago on Thursday so I'm trying not to buy any perishables. I settled on Shortbread, a simple yet sophisticated cookie. This recipe is the best shortbread recipe ever! It is so delicate, crumbling in your fingers if you're not gentle. They melt in your mouth: buttery and dangerously addictive.

David's Taiwanese Gourmet
CONTENT
Thanks for patiently waiting this weekend, as I busted my butt in my first triathlon. It was certainly killer!Unfortunately, Lon was still sick, but came out to support me and take pictures, but by evening, he was feeling worse, so we decided on a dinner at David's Taiwanese Gourmet David's Taiwanese Gourmet, where we knew we could get lots of different soups and soup noodles. (Boy, was this 20x better then the stuff we get by our apartment.) My family used to go to David's when I was a teen (about 15 years ago) but the ownership and the food has changed since then, some for the better, some for the worse, some just different.There's a traditional Taiwanese soup that I had in mind, called Hwa Dz Gung. It's supposed to be a soup with blobs of squid in fish paste. Oddly, this one didn't have fish paste, but the soup had all the right stuff otherwise, fried onions, bamboo shoots, and mushrooms. The flavor was fantastic and the squid was cooked perfectly so I wasn't too disappointed, but my mom was really bummed that they didn't have a traditional oyster noodle soup (2nd pic on this post). It's the opitamy of Taiwanese food and we can't imagine how they could NOT have it.The Beef Noodle Soup, which always makes me feel like home, was rich, yet not oily, exactly what I look for in this dish. The chunks of beef were extra tender and they gave a generous amount of the pickled mustard greens.

Microwave Cooking
CONTENT
Generally, I don't promote microwave cooking, because that leads to eating frozen meals or pre-packaged stuff. But, I have to admit, some things are either better in the microwave or yield equal results, and therefore makes sense because it's easier and quicker.Lon asked me to do this post and at first I hesitated because I can't give exact recipes. The problem is that microwaves vary greatly, more than any other kitchen appliance I can think of. Our current microwave could blow something up in minutes, while Lon's old microwave took close to 8 minutes to make a bowl of oatmeal. After much discussion, I agreed with Lon, this is still valuable information and I should share it.Corn-on-the-CobI almost always heat corn-on-the cob in the microwave. I know lots of people like the flavor of grilled corn, including myself, but with that charred goodness, you forgo some moisture. With the microwave corn-on-the cob, you get juicy kernels that burst with every bite. I also have a habit of eating my corn-on-the-cob kernel by kernel. That's my idea of fun and this method makes it easier:Remove most layers of husk, leaving just 1-2 layers of leaves. Wet a paper towel and ring out the excess. Wrap it around the corn. Depending on the size of the corn, I microwave it for 1-2 minutes on each side, but remember that I have a powerful microwave.BeetsEven though I love beets, I didn't make them all that often because roasting takes a long time. Then I found out that beets could be microwaved (explained in James Peterson's book, Vegetables). How long depends on how many beets and the size of the beets, but just to give you a guideline, I tend to microwave 4 mid-sized beets for 2-3 minutes, in a covered tupperware container. Then let it rest for 2 minutes. Turn the beets over and microwave again for 2-3 minutes. Let it rest for another 2 minutes and then test with a pairing knife to see if it's tender.EggsThis does not include all eggs by any means. This method is just better when you want to make an imitation of the McDonald's Egg McMuffins. It's similar to a poached egg, but fits perfectly round on an English Muffin. You just crab and egg into a small bowl and microwave on the lowest setting possible.ButterSome baking recipes call for melted butter. I prefer to melt butter in the microwave because doing it on the stove may separate more milk solids.Microwave Reheating~Some things are easier to heat in the microwave than on the stove:

When I was cleaning out my grandmother's house after she passed, I found a "Gourmet Microwave Cooking" book. I love using the microwave, but the horrors to be found there!And I microwave beets virtually the same way! Sometimes I just cook them and then slather some butter on them and eat them. Must be the Midwestern penchant for dairy products that drives me...

I always microwave my corn too. So easy and fast, but I think the best result is still by steaming. Sometimes mircrowaving draws a lot of moisture out of the corn.

Microwaves in india are sold on the pltform that you can cook using them. It would be difficult to sell them on just a reheating platform as india is a value driven market and we still are not into frozen meals. i have used the micro extensively for cooking as we don't have an oven. Some of the things that we make include: daal (Indian lentil soup), Indian chicken curry, tandoori chicken, a mayo based casserole chicken, choc souffle, choc bread based cake, potatoes sauteed in whole Indan spices, tomato and onion

Knife, your comment is really interesting to me!  I have noticed that just about every South Asian (Indian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi, etc.) restaurant in NYC (at least not the super fancy ones) use a microwave openly.  They all use it for reheating, but it's out in the open and there's no shame for them.Most other restaurants probably use them as well, but hide the microwaves in the back.

N.Y. Dosas in Washington Square Park
CONTENT
Jessica and I are both not feeling great. I stayed home from work and she is trying to relax -- her triathalon is this weekend! After being couped up inside all day, we took Ice for a walk and headed down Fifth Ave. We ended up circling half way around Washington Square Park when we ran into \"the dosa man\", more formerly known as N.Y. Dosas N.Y. Dosas.After hearing so many wonderful things about this street cart that only sells vegetarian Indian choices, we had to pick up a snack. We asked for his suggestions and we got the Special Pondicherry Dosa and a Samosa. We found a bench, sat with Ice, and starting munching.Honestly... it just wasn't that great. Nothing wrong here, fairly fresh dosa (a crepe of rice and lentil) filled with raw, fresh veggies (onions, carrots, peppers, etc.) and lightly curried potatoes. The vegetables were crisp and enjoyable, but basically this was a tiny salad in a crepe. The sauce he recommended didn't add much flavor. And for $6 this is no steal. It does include a small cup of soup, but we both agreed its spice overwhelmed its mediocre taste and we didn't finish it.The samosa was a different story. It was as good as any vegetarian samosa we'd ever had. It was so NOT oily, it almost tasted baked. The included mint chutney was a nice refreshing taste (almost like it had cucumbers in it), and we felt it was a perfect snack for those NYU students looking for a quick fix between classes. Especially since they were 2 for $3. Ours was $1.75 (since we only bought one). While we waited for our dosa, everyone else who stopped by the stand seemed to already know the score, since they all only bought the samosas.We probably won't be back, but if we do, we'll know the score too and stick to the samosas.

No matter how awful, I would KILL for some Indian food anywhere near me in this wasteland. I miss being able to critique food!! Dosas are really fun to make though-do you folks ever make Indian food at home??
The knife
2008-09-20 04:13:00
Hope you guys are feeling better and Jessica...all the best for the triathlon. I think you must be the most active foodie ever. The combinaation was quite interesting as dosa is South Indian dish while samosa is more of a North Indian one. The real samosa should be oily as the potato is stuffed in the flour sheet and deep fried. Dosas can be crisp as well as soft. Depends on which part of South India you are in...but yes a soft dosa does taste quite close to a dosa. the classic dosa combination is a sada (plain, no stuffing) dosa with sambhar (a tamarind based lentil soup) and ground coconut chutney
Jessica@Foodmayhem
2008-09-20 08:47:00
Dr. Food, we don't make Indian food often but I'll try to get that going when the weather gets colder. I always think of Indian food as winter food.Thanks Knife, I think I would've probably liked a plain one with just dipping sauces because the dosas itself was a nice texture but the filling was really bland, and I thought that was odd since I've never thought of Indian food as bland before.

I don't know if you are referring to Sarvana Bhavan. I think this is a chain based at Chennai (earlier Madras) which is the capital of tmail Nadu in South india. I had eaten there almost ten years back. They have got an assembly line like set up where they serve celan, wholesome South Indian vegetarian food. I have eaten their food recently during work trips to Chennai where they would serve executive lunch boxes. i won't be surprised if they have branches in NY

the samosas he sells actually come from "delhi palace" in jackson heights. if you want 'em hot and fresh, go to the source on 74th where they're only $1 a piece. they used to be 2 for $1, but the rising cost of flour has forced them to raise their prices. it's still worth it.

Lon is home sick today so I decided to make him breakfast. I found this really interesting recipe for a Puffed Apple Pancake, something I had never seen before. I wasn't sure what to expect but I was really impressed with how cool it looked, puffy and golden, with some sliced apples visible.We both loved it, light and moderately sweet, with characteristics like a souffle, a pancake, and a popover. It was super neat. I would definitely serve it to guests.

Luo Bo Gan
CONTENT
I grew up with this stuff, Luo Bo Gan, preserved and dried turnips or radishes. They're salty and crunchy, meant to be eaten in small amounts to accompany rice, congee, or noodles. Sometimes, they're spicy, like this one, and can really give the pick-me-up to anything bland. I say this because this is how I save myself when I have to order noodle soup delivery (which is mediocre at best in our neighborhood but when we're sick....)You can buy Luo Bo Gan in jars at Asian markets but I get my stash from my mom, who gets it from Taiwan.

Glazed Poppy Bread

I like quickbreads, as you can probably tell, and that probably means that I'm lazy. In my defense, I usually make stuff depending on what I'm trying to use up in my fridge or pantry. This time, I wanted to use up milk and oranges. Oh, and then I only had a teeny bit of almond extract left so that's what I put in. The result is a wonderful breakfast bread, light and perfect with coffee.Glazed Poppy BreadGlaze (optional)1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (325 degrees F with convection). Grease a 9″ loaf pan.2. In a large bowl, stir together flour, sugar, poppy seeds, baking powder, and salt. Set aside.3. In a medium sized bowl, stir together milk, oil, eggs, almond extract, vanilla extract, and zest.4. Mix wet ingredients into dry ingredients just until combined. Pour into prepared pan.5. Bake for 50-60 minutes, or until toothpick comes out clean. Let it rest in the pan for 5 minutes. At this time, mix together the orange juice and vanilla extract. Slowly mix in confectioner's sugar while whisking. I used 3/4 cup confectioner's sugar but you can go up to 1 cup.6. Poke holes in the poppy bread and pour glaze on top (optional).

Beet, Goat Cheese, Honey Walnut, Mandarin Salad
CONTENT
Beets and Goat Cheese are one of those matches made in heaven, and therefore show up in salads quite often. You can make it even more orgasmic but adding mandarin oranges (canned) and honey covered walnuts. I don't like writing recipes for salads ( I do for dressing though) because the amounts don't need to be so exact. If you really love one ingredient, you can put more.Here, I microwaved beets (method explained here), peeled and sliced them after they cooled. Sandwich some goat cheese in between each layer. This is just for presentation so if you are pressed for time, just throw the ingredients together.

I mentioned my first taste of Archer Farms just the other day, so last night we opened the Buffalo Wing Savory Pretzels and the Black Bean and Jalapeno Tortilla Chips. Unfortunately, neither of us liked the pretzels. We didn't taste buffalo wing; I taste vinegar and Lon tastes beer.The Black Bean & Jalapeno Tortilla Chips were a lot better. They remind me of Doritos but with a distinct black bean flavor and a nice kick from the jalapeno that really builds after a serving or two. I really like them but they are a tad too salty. I'll be finishing at least this bag anyway...

Webster's Wine Bar on 1480 West Webster Avenue is awesome - they have the biggest wine list in the city and some great tapas offerings meant to go with the vino. Plus these people know what they're talking about - the entire waitstaff go to Europe every year on educational trips.

The Serious Eats recs are pretty good. Many are the same as ones I'd suggest, here are some more thoughts...Phoenix is one of the best dim sum places in Chicago.  Unfortunately, Chicago is not known for their dim sum so that's not saying much.  It tends to be a bit greasy.Joy Yee's noodles are only so-so, but that's definitely the place to go for real fruit freezes with boba.  Original in Chinatown is best though branches are open at UIC, Evanston and Naperville.Definitely check out Bob Chinn's in Wheeling for Seafood, they're one of the top 10 revenue restaurants in the country and fly in $30k of fresh fish every day.  Their downtown location is not as good.For main stream deep dish pizza, Lou Malnati's has beaten out Giordano's, Gino's and Uno's in readers choice for several years.For ice cream, check out Village Creamery in Niles (near Super H Mart big Korean market) which is owned by Philippinos and serves flavors like Buko-Pandan, Jack Fruit, Durian, Queso and Corn flavors.  For real cultured frozen yogurt, check out Berry Chill downtown.For Chicago hot dogs, an excellent choice is Hot Doug's Sausage Emporium.  However, it has 1-2 hour waits and closes at 4pm.  For quicker service and more classic every day feeling, you can get a Maxwell Street Polish sausage near UIC.Italian Beef is a good choice, some people like Al's b/c of their strong anise flavor.  The original is also near UIC campus.  Consider getting a dipped italian beef in which they dip the entire sandwich in the jus.Portillo's is a decent chain that has Italian beef and Maxwell polishes and other similar foods, but they've gone down a bit in quality as they've expanded.Across from Al's by UIC is some of the best Italian Ice around, though they call it Italian Lemonade since all flavors are lemon based and contain whole slices of lemon.   Johnnie's is excellent for fresh fruit italian ices but it's far, at the Arlington Heights exit on 90 (near where I live).  The small is too small and the large is too large.  You could potentially stop there on the way to Bob Chinn's.The American take on Gyros supposedly came from Chicago as did Flaming Saganiki cheese so you may want to check out Greek Town on Halsted near UIC.Another local invention with a Puerto Rican nod is the Jibarito at Borinquen's.  It's a steak sandwich but instead of bread, it uses fried plantains (similar to un-smashed tostones).  A bit greasy but tasty.BTW, definitely go to Alinea.  Achatz's tongue cancer is in remission but there's an unspoken fear that one day, Alinea will be no more.Will post more if any stand out ideas come to mind.  If you want, you can attempt to sort through my blogs for other recs but i haven't been too consistent about it... i really need to implement tags and categories some time too...  http://www.filtsai.com

Some of the best Italian you'll find in Chicago is in the near suburbs of Berwyn and Cicero. Unfortunately my favorite butcher (D'Andrea's) isn't reopening until October (they have these really flavorful Italian sausages with huge fennel seeds in the meat...so good) but Freddy's Pizza & Geleteria (www.freddyspizza.com) has the best deli food ever. I know most people go to Chicago and eat deep dish pizza, but I don't really care for it. And I really don't care for the tourist traps like Pizza Uno and Giordano's. Falco's Pizzeria however has a number of locations around the Chicagoland area, but don't go to the downtown pizza parlor. The best (and the original) is in Cicero (http://falcospizzeria.com/location.asp). Falco's sausage pizza uses some of the best sausage on their pies. And of course, if you like Italian beef, go to Portillo's for a "dipped Italian beef with mozz and sweet peppers" (http://www.portillos.com/portillos/). And for good mussels and pasta, go to one of the many fantastic Capri Restaurants in the area.Say hello to my city for me!

I was just in Chicago for a couple of days last month.  You're going to have a blast!I really really recommend Giordano's deep dish pizza.  I've had quite a few others, but this one I really loved.I also recommend going to Greek town.  I can't for the life of me remember the name, but it starts with a "men".  Great authentic Greek food and a really good price.

I would second Louis Milnati's pizza.My grandpa's noodle company is called Wah King Noodle Co. They sell it in Asian grocery stores so if you pass by one, I'd recommend picking some up, but they would add quite a bit of weight to your luggage, lol.

Oooh... breakfast...Sorry to spam your comments, but I gotta show some gratuity for your Mediterranean suggestions (9 days til my vacation!)Walker Bros. Original Pancake House is good.  There are several locations with slightly different names.  I like their potato pancakes which are made with mashed instead of hashed/shredded.  I like their buttermilk pancakes though whole grain and others are good too.  Or try an apple pancake, about 1.5 pounds.  Even my smack-talking high metabolism friend couldn't finish it.Lucky Platter in Evanston has tasty pancakes, and the best Eggs Benedict value I've seen.  It's the first time an excellent Eggs Benedict actually filled me up.  That didn't stop me from trying their blintzes too though, which were good, though a tad sweet.

I went to Chicago for New Year's last year for the first time.Greek Islands in Greek town was delicious and surprisingly cheap. Giordano's may be a chain but it was crazy good - we had it twice the week we visited (they delivered to our hotel room when we were struck by a sudden craving!). It's the amazing flaky crust! I wish I had an opportunity to try Gino's (East) pizza, it was recommended to me several times. I liked Twin Anchors for the neighborhoody vibe, beer and ribs, a worthwhile trek.  Hema's Kitchen served us amazing Indian food, with a very memorable raita which I've never tasted the match of (the place is BYOB, but neighboring shops sell Indian beers). Almost by accident I had a very good meal at Bistro 110 as well. Don't forget the origianl Billy Goat Tavern (beneath the street at 430 N Michigan Ave). A tourist trap to be sure, but mighty fine old-fashioned burgers of the cheeseborger! cheeseborger! skit fame.

New Gallon Milk Containers a Comin'
CONTENT
Just when you got used to the classic shape of one gallon jugs of milk, they throw a curve ball your way and create a new shape for milk containers! Crazy. Well apparently the new shapes are much easier to store and ship, therefore saving the companies money (the article has more info). My guess is that this will eventually lead to different shaped refrigerators to hold these containers.One interesting note, per the article, is that with the new shape container, shipping crates hold 50% more milk per cubic foot. While it is good business, it's also good for the environment!

Archer Farms Cereal: Multigrain with Yogurt Cranberries
CONTENT
This weekend, we were out in Long Island, so I got to stop in at Target. I've never had their own grocery brand, Archer Farms, before but my first experience was a good one. The Multigrain Cereal with Yogurt Cranberries is a blend of wheat, kamut, millet, brown rice, and oats. What's kamut? We didn't know either, but we looked it up and it's a type of wheat that doesn't even have a botanical classification yet. It was only registered as a plant variety 18 years ago. Ok, we're pretty geeky for thinking this is cool but it does taste good.The cereal is very lightly sweetened, airy and nutty, vaguely resembling Kashi cereals. The natural flavor (it is all natural) of a blend of grains contrasts nicely to tangy yogurt cranberries, and it gets pretty addictive.

FYI Kamut brand grain is actually Triticum turgidum, subspecies turanicum, and it is also known as Khorasan wheat.  "Kamut" is a trademarked name the grain is sold under to guarantee it is always organically grown, is always the original unmodified variety and that it contains certain high levels of proten, selenium and meets our quality specs!  We test every field it is grown on.  Not to mention it taste great.  I love this cereal as well and we eat it at home!  Thanks for the great blog.  For more info you can go to http://www.kamut.com!Cheers,Tara BlythKamut International

Brunch: Veggie and Goat Cheese Sandwiches, Manchego Mini Quiche, and Danish Apple Pastry
CONTENT
We had our friends, Peter, Jeff, and Erin, over for brunch. Since brunches are around noon, you have to plan to make some things in advance, unless you want to get up way too early. I'm pretty anal about optimal eating, meaning I won't allow for something that's ok because of convenience. I've got to eat and serve things the best way possible. For that reason, I use roasted and grilled veggies a lot. They taste better (in my opinion) the next day. So, the night before, I fire roasted peppers, and grilled eggplant and zucchini.Grilled Eggplant and Zucchini1. Preheat your grill. In a 9X13 dish, stir together vinegar, oil, lemon juice, basil, garlic, thyme, and oregano. Soak eggplant in the mixture for 15 minutes.2. Grill eggplant until soft, about 3 minutes on each side (depending on how hot your grill is). If they look dry, brush some marinade on them while they grill. I usually season while they are on the grill but you can season the marinade if you want.3. Soak zucchini in the remaining marinade for 10 minutes. Grill until soft, about 3 minutes on each side (depending on how hot your grill is).4. Store in tupperware and refrigerate over-night.Note: You may notice that the eggplant soaks up most of the oil in the marinade. Don't worry. The zucchini does not need as much oil.To make the sandwiches, I used Seeded Semolina bread, spread with goat cheese, and layered the eggplant, zucchini, and peppers. All the heavy lifting is done the day before. I love the freshness of tangy goat cheese with farmer's market vegetables. I had to do it just one more time before summer is over.

Smokey Bones
CONTENT
For Lon's mom's birthday, we went to Smokey Bones Smokey Bones, a chain scattered throughout the Eastern United States. I had never heard of this large barbeque joint (that looks like an over-sized sports bar) and they have probably never seen an Asian before. Yet, they were filled causing a wait at 5:25 pm on a Saturday. Oddly, we saw many empty tables when we were seated.We immediately ordered some appetizers and luckily these came pretty quickly. Unfortunately, this was the worst plate of nachos I've ever had. I've always thought nachos were a safe bet, hard to mess up, but I stand corrected. These chips were stale, the meat (mix of pork and chicken) was cold, the cheese was cold and hardened already, and the salsa was sweetened with sugar.The sampler platter did come hot: decent onion rings, decent tater skins, pretty good chicken fingers. Two problems though. One, we asked for bacon on the side so Kasi could eat the skins. You can see the bacon there, but our nice waiter did bring us 4 news ones without bacon, although it did take more than 20 minutes. Two, the seasoning was so inconsistent that certain pieces were fine while others almost killed me. Just imagine eating pure salt in a teaspoon. Unfortunately, this problem went on all night with fries, onion rings, etc. After the appetizers, there was an absurdly long gap of time before the entrees came.

Goya Canned Black Beans
CONTENT
A few weeks ago, on Friday, August 29, 2008, we went through can after can of Goya Black Beans (Frijoles Negros) looking for one that wasn't spoiled-looking. We couldn't believe that so many in a row were ruined. They had a nasty grayish-white sludge on top, some worse than others.I jumped on Google and found one blog post about the same issue, on Erin Cooks. She just kept buying more cans, but we don't roll that way. We sent the following note to Goya:We just threw out six cans of \"Goya Black Beans (Negro Frijoles)\" because they were all spoiled. Each can had greyish-white foam and chunks on top and had a bizarre odor. We regularly buy Goya black beans and kidney beans and have never seen this before.In addition to ruining the dinner we were going to make tonight -- we were shocked to see this many cans that were bad. We checked the expiration date on the bottom of each can before throwing them out and each had the same expiration date in 2011; they were in a package of six purchased from a BJs in Queens.We would, at the minimum, like a refund for these!Exactly two weeks later (this past Friday), we received a response from Goya:This is in response to your email, concerning the above-mentioned product. We always appreciate when consumers such as you take the time to bring concerns to our attention.We certainly regret that you felt dissatisfied with our product. Goya values all our consumers by providing the best quality products available.We appreciate the concerns that you have raised and have carefully reviewed them.In response to the complaint, we advise you that due to the warmer weather coming in sooner then expected, the black beans were growing in very dry causing the liquid to solidify and a higher amount of starch, (white/grayish substance) to accumulate leaving the beans in a mashed state.A test has been conducted to make sure there is nothing wrong with the beans and it turns out that this poses no health hazard and nutrient value is the sameAs a token of our appreciation for contacting us, we are sending you a reimbursement for this product.Kindest Regards,GOYA Foods, Inc.The most important outcome is for anyone else who finds this blog post, don't throw away the beans! They're safe to eat, although disgusting looking (we're still not sure we would eat it).This seems like the kind of news that would've had a press release, or at least there would be a note on their web site (perhaps next to the product?). Alas, there was none. And interestingly, as you can probably tell from the various typos in the e-mail they sent, it doesn't seem like they've got a form response put together.We're satisfied with Goya's response, because we'll be refunded for the product, and because they're aware of the issue, have tested, and feel it's safe to eat. That is corporate responsibility in action, and it's what's expected.We like Goya alot, so we had higher hopes. They need to be a bit more proactive, either putting a note on suspect cans or on their website or something. Their response shouldn't have taken two weeks, they should've had a customer service response ready for this issue and just sent it out. But we set the bar high.

Thanks for letting me know that I wasn't alone in the bad bean fiasco. I truly couldn't believe how many cans we opened/bought. It was like an episode of The Twilight Zone. I honestly haven't purchased any Goya products since this incident. I've been using beans from Whole Foods exclusively. I never wrote to Goya myself as I hadn't taken any photos of the beans and assumed they'd want some sort of proof, but my cans looked exactly like the ones you've posted here. While customer service appears to claim that the beans are OK to eat, I doubt I would ever serve anything that looks so gnarly straight from a can - testing or no testing. I also agree with you that it is very irresponsible of them not to have addressed this issue in a mass press release.

Ever since going to cooking school I have learned all about botulism, which you mostly acquire from anything canned. So if there is any bulge in the can, throw it away. Yeah, those beans look nasty, but they are probably fine.

We are always amazed how most big companies miss the mark in customer service - go Goya (almost makes me want to eat beans).By the way, the timing does make a little sense in that they did testing, but ideally they would have sent a quick note immediately to let you know they will be doing testing.Also, for you parents out there, we had a great customer service response after purchasing a defective sippy cup from NUBY. They sent a new cup and reimbursed us for shipping the old one to them so their engineers could look into it.

Jade Asian Restaurant for Mom's Birthday
CONTENT
We've been to Jade Asian Restaurant several times for dim sum, but hadn't tried dinner there yet. My mom and her friends, the most social group of 60+ year olds, reserved three tables for her birthday last night and then reserved tables at a dance hall for afterwards. Geez, I think I usually get to bed before my mom.Lon and I were the first to arrive, 10 minutes early, while everyone else was late due to rain. Good thing they had peanuts and pickled veggies on the table (common for Cantonese restaurants).Besides half of the dishes being below standard, all of them came at the same time (except for the fish). I'm a fast eater but this was ridiculous and not at all enjoyable. I couldn't get to most of the dishes before they got cold.Ending with a plate of fruit and an average Red Bean and Tapioca Dessert Soup, I felt disappointed. This wasn't on par with Flushing food, and not worth a trip out there. I'd still recommend Jade Asian Restaurant for Dim Sum, but don't go for dinner.

Mini Carrot Spiced Cupcakes (Sans Nuts)
CONTENT
I made these Mini Carrot Spiced Cupcakes almost 6 months ago, and promised to make them again without the nuts. I love nuts, but in these little cupcakes, I just thought a smoother texture throughout would work better. Today is my mom's birthday so it was the perfect opportunity to make mini-cupcakes again, the perfect, travel on the train, going to a restaurant, birthday cake. No extra plates, knives, or forks needed, and her friends loved them. Here is my tweaked recipe:Mini Carrot Spice Cupcakes~makes about 30 mini cupcakes1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Spray mini muffin pan with non-stick (Pam).2. Beat eggs, white sugar, and brown sugar in a large bowl. Mix in the oil and vanilla, until completely blended. Mix in carrots and apple.3. In a separate bowl, mix the flour, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, and ginger. Fold the flour mixture into the carrot mixture until even. Do not over mix.4. Spoon into prepared muffin pan and bake for 12 minutes or until toothpick comes out clean.5. Cool in pan for 10 minutes before un-molding. Cool completely before frosting.For cream cheese frosting, half this recipe will frost about 30 mini cupcakes.HAPPY BIRTHDAY MOM!

Inside the Despana Basket: Lentejas and Salchichon
CONTENT
I've been waiting till the temperatures cooled a bit, before using the lentils (Lentejas) in our Despana Basket. The advantage of jarred lentils, over dried, is that you don't have to rehydrate them. That's why I call it a Quick Lentil Soup; it's relatively faster and easier.It's taken us a while to go through all the fabulous meats in our basket, but we're finally down to the last one, Slachichon, a dry cured sausage. It's delicious eaten as is, similar to salami, just thinly slice it, and have a glass of wine, maybe some cheese, ahh...I decided to throw some into the soup for extra flavor.Quick Lentil Soup1. In a large dutch oven, heat the salchichon on high heat until it gives off fat, about 2 minutes. 2. Add leeks, carrots, onion, and stir until softened, about 5 minutes. 3. Add chicken broth and lentils and bring to a boil. 4. Turn down to a simmer and cook covered for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.

Tong Thai Brasserie Revisited
CONTENT
Last time we were at Tong Thai Brasserie Tong Thai Brasserie, we vowed to come back before the prices went up (just our own speculation). This time, we were a party of 5, ordering 5 appetizers, 6 entrees, and 2 desserts.Our friends, Sara, Angie, and Winnie, had never been to Tong before so we did order some repeats from last time. The Vegetable Daikon Cake and Curried Puffs were just as good (see pics and description from last time) as we remembered. The Thai Dumplings were fine but nothing special. These days, you can get pretty darn good dumplings in the freezer section of Chinese markets.

Acqua
CONTENT
I forgot to bring my camera but not worries, not much food porn at Acqua Acqua. We were on the Upper West Side looking at an apartment (yes, still looking) and just picked a random nearby restaurant for dinner. They had curb side seats available so we decided to enjoy the great weather. Starting with the bread, meant to be focaccia (but not successful), it was mediocre. The olive oil was flavorless, even with the dried herbs thrown in. We started with a Grilled Shrimp appetizer, served with white beans, lightly dressed tough arugula, and cherry tomatoes. The shrimp were seasoned and grilled nicely but the salad was boring. The white beans seamed to just be canned beans thrown on. I ordered a Margherita Pizza, the thinnest of thin crusts I've ever seen or tasted. Parts of it really tasted like a cracker, which also limits the amount of sauce and cheese it can hold, leaving me feel like I'm not sure I ate anything. One of the big problems with such a thin crust is that it gets cold in a minute, before you even eat one slice. Lon ordered the Lasagna, which wasn't great either. The pasta was actually good, but useless when layered with flavorless ground meat (no sauce). The sauce, which is average in flavor and loose in consistency, is just poured around it. At $44 (with tip), I thought this was a pretty crappy meal, with ultra slow service and a smile.

You Drink... what?
CONTENT
There's a interesting map floating around the Internet today... it's actually from quite a few years ago (seeming originating from The Pop vs. Soda Page), but probably just about as accurate. Have a peek at it below, it's about what people call that fun carbonated drink with syrup in it, depending on where they live. In New York City it's called \"soda\", in the South-Eastern US it's called \"coke\" and in the Mid-Western states, it's generally referred to as \"pop\".This reminds me of when I was working on a project for a client in Wisconsin. I was staying in a hotel and called a local pizza joint. I asked them for a Chicken Parmigiana Hero, they hadn't the slightest clue what I was talking about. In the end I ate pizza.

Oh yeah, the "pop" term is thoroughly ingrained in my Midwestern vocabulary. It's weird though that it lists the Pac NW as a "pop" land-everyone I know who has grown up here refers to it as "soda" and in southern Illinois/St.Louis area, I have heard "soda-pop" an awful lot. I find regional variations fascinating... It did, however, confuse the heck out of me in Atlanta when I ordered a ginger ale and the waitress referred to it as "ginger coke." I know Coca-Cola was born there, but come on!

Starbucks Better Breakfast Hour
CONTENT
This morning, I attended the Starbucks Better Breakfast hour, an event hosted by Starbucks, where food bloggers and magazine editors were invited to sample and discuss Starbucks new line of healthy breakfast options.In attendance:Chesna Closs of Fit EsteemEd Levine of Serious EatsJaime Green of Cheap Healthy GoodKelcey Kitner of The Mama Bird DiariesLinda Rogers of ParentingMelissa Chapman of Single Minded Women...and a few more (sitting on the other side) who I didn't get a chance to exchange cards with.It was a truly enjoyable event, meeting other foodies, hearing some mommy insights, and of course I just love talking about food. I don't think I can do justice to rehashing the whole 1+ hour conversation, so here's just my thoughts.Apple Bran Muffin - $1.757 grams of fiber, 7 grams of protein, 330 CaloriesIt tastes healthy (you'll know there's bran in there), but still very sweet, and heavy on the cinnamon.This cute star shaped thing (I don't know what to call it), is denser than a muffin, drier, less sweet, but still tastes healthy. Ok fine, it's quite terrible.Like a granola bar, natural in taste, not too sweet.We didn't taste this one, but it's basically a small whole wheat bagel, some fruit, cheese, and a hard boiled egg.This was an average roll at best, average supermarket refridgerated kind, not average bakery roll. It comes with Almond Butter (100 calories) and/or Strawberry Preserves (40 calories).Instant oatmeal ( I prefer old fashioned oats but this is ok) with a choice of three toppings, brown sugar, nut medley, dried fruit. The toppings are packed in smart 100 calorie packs and you can have as much as you want. (Hurry! I think they'll eventually put a limit on this.)On a side not, I wrote about Starbucks aquisition of Clover before. Unfortunately, there are no plans to bring it to NY yet.

*GONG* It's my 20th visit to Sushi Yasuda. Hooray! *GONG*OK, so you know how much I love this place. I'll keep it short. I tried an Ume Plum and Salted Shiso Roll. I'm not a fan of Shiso (or any mint-like thing) but I tried to keep an open mind since Sushi Yasuda has made me an Uni fan (which I previously wasn't). I still don't like the Shiso, but the Ume was great, salty, sweet, sour, tangy, fruity. Chef Tomura told us that this Japanese specialty is aged for about 5 years. I imagine that is what makes the flavor so concetrated, yet so smooth.

Add the do fu gan and stir. Add carrots and onions. Stir-fry for a minute. Add leek, snap peas, black bean sauce, and sugar. Stir actively until vegetables are tender, about 4 minutes.

Chilled Sesame Eggplant
CONTENT
I've been getting some requests for vegetarian friendly recipes and I'll try to accommodate.This recipe is inspired by the eggplant we had at Aquagrill. We had never had anything like it and since it's been so long, I can't really remember it exactly. What was amazing though, was the unique texture. It's so soft, yet each piece holds itself together, while being unbelievably juicy. My best guess to achieving this texture was to steam the Chinese/Japanese Eggplant, marinate it, then chill it. I think that's the method because it tasted pretty darn close. Lon can't remember the eggplant from Aquagrill, but he really liked this one.Chilled Sesame Eggplant1. In a small bowl, whisk together vegetable oil, soy sauce, rice vinegar, sugar, sesame oil, ginger, and white pepper. Set aside.2. Cut eggplants on a diagonal in 3/4″ thick slices.3. Steam the eggplant until tender, about 5 minutes.4. Place the eggplant in tupperware. Pour the liquid mixture on top. Cover with a tight lid and shake until evenly coated.5. Remove the lid and let it sit on the couter for 10 minutes so steam can evaporate. Cover and refrigerate for 5 hours.6. Sprinkle with sesame seeds and serve.

So I tried the recipe last night.  Generally I'd say very good, my only thought was that when I have variation of this dish in Chinese restaurants, the sauce is thicker, which I like.  Also, I was a little heavy handed with my "pinch"  of ginger,so that threw off the balance.  But all in all, a really simple healthy dish with tons of flavor.

Tomato Dill Shredded Chicken
CONTENT
We got a nice size whole chicken and although we were feeling pretty hungry for dinner last night, my desire for pulled / shredded chicken overcame the hunger. So Jessica snacked on some kiwi while I started prepping. While I desired shredded chicken, Jessica was feeling some dill.Southern flavors inspired this dish, so trinity aromatics were used instead of the classic mirepoix. Everything was a bit rushed, so I didn't get the exact recipe. Generally, I broke up the chicken into parts, removing most of the skin, and browned them in some vegetable oil in a dutch oven. Then I removed the chicken and started softening two large carrots, chopped into large sticks, 1 large green onion, 1 large yellow onion, both roughly chopped with some kosher salt, black pepper, and a bit of red pepper flakes. Those cooked about 10 minutes.Then 3 smashed garlic cloves, all the chicken, 1 cup of shiraz red wine, and 8 oz of tomato sauce were added to the put. The goal was to get a good braise going. These cooked about 30 minutes. Then the chicken was flipped, and half a lemon, cut into a few pieces, plus a huge bunch of dill (rinsed and roughly chopped) were tossed in.Altogether the chicken cooked about 75 minutes, until the carrots were tender, and all the meat was cooked. Jessica and I then removed the chicken parts and pulled the meat apart with forks. Meanwhile, I pulled all the dill and green peppers out of the pot, plus about half the carrots. Then with a stick blender and a bit of water (to achieve the right consistency) I blended the sauce. Afterwards the chicken was tossed back in and coated.The flavor was amazing! The chicken was cooked perfectly, and the sauce achieved natural sweetness from the carrots and onions. The dill flavor worked perfectly with the tomato and subtle lemon flavor. We ate the shredded meat on the mini-buns we discussed in the sliders post.

Belgian Waffles
CONTENT
Belgian Waffles are made with a yeast leavened batter, which requires a little more work (and time) than American waffles. The result is lighter and fluffier, which I do like more, but when you don't have the time, I'm still happy with American waffles. Lon loved these Belgian ones so much, even when he ate them cold a few hours later. They were also tasty enough to eat plain, but strawberry compote and fresh bananas can't hurt.

Aloe Vera Juice is supposed to be very good for you, with an expansive list of health benefits. I happened to see a bottle of Aloe Vera Drink at the Chinese market so I figured I'd give it a try. These drinks have added sugars (and I'm not even sure how much real aloe juice is in there) so I'm not sure if this is what the real stuff tastes like. This one tasted very similar to Litchi Juice, which is pretty yummy. I'm going to try to find a more \"real\" one next time.

Then remove to plate, adding some relish (or pickles) on top of the burgers. Enjoy!If you don't have salt pork, substitute with fat back or use vegetable oil. Just use enough to coat the cast iron. We made half with salt pork and half with vegetable oil (as an experiment). Jessica and I both agree the salt pork burgers were noticeably better.You could also substitute beef for the bison.These were absolutely delicious!! We had fun and really enjoyed these little guys along with a salad of cucumber and yellow tomatoes.

Man! Your mock sliders look much better than mine! I tried once and failed. Quite a few of my friends worked in White Castle when I was in high school so when I found out that the meat comes in LIQUID form before being poured onto a grill (including such tantalizing ingredients as "liquid dehydrated onions" and "reconstituted dehydrated liquid beef concentrate") they never quite tasted the same to me.Despite this, however, there are no White Castles in the Western states, and after looking at your pictures, they are "what I crave"

2008-09-07 16:42:00
Oh wow... Dr. Food, sadly while I agree that I should be turned off by the concept of liquid beef, I am oddly intrigued, and hungry.  Any ideas from your friends how they formed the perfect patties with holes?  I assume they didn't use my chopstick method...

These look great.  Smart way to cook burgers, but I always wonder about steaming the buns on the meat b/c it means the bread is touching the not fully cooked part of the meat for awhile.  White Manna in Hackensack does patties that they flatten with no holes onto the  grill and shaved onions instead of  diced.  Very good I repeat - but again the bun  problem concerns me there.  Second, and this is just amazing although not related to your post, I saw a guy with a tattoo of a big ginger root on his arm today.  How friggin cool is that?
Lon
2008-09-07 18:52:00
Thanks JS!Bill, eh, the buns don't really touch raw meat, because they sit on the already cooked side of the patties.  Also, and this is personal logic (not actual food safety) I would eat the meat raw anyway   So the raw factor doesn't concern me.Btw, Dr Food, Jessica is completely grossed out by the liquid meat and liquid dehydrated (oxymoronic) onions...
EMC
2008-09-07 21:02:00
I had a feeling that info would gross her out! It grosses me out but I remember seeing them pour it into little molded cast iron areas on the grill. Once the meat began to harden (this by the way is something you NEVER want to see in a recipe) they would poke holes it them with a meat poker to ensure even cooking.Oh yeah, and I remember even when I was 16 thinking "dehydrated AND liquid??? Eh?" Of course, I still ate them....and still would if given the opportunity.

Dr. Food, I have never eaten a White Castle burger before and I used to think, perhaps, I am deprived, but no thanks, no liquid meat for me. =/Grace, Lon's sliders were tasty and made with real bison meat. I'll stick to those.

I can't argue with Dr food's experience, but I've seen white castle on food shows and they cook the burgers from frozen patties.  Also, on the show it was mentioned that white castle was the first fast food to cook the burgers where the customers could see them because customers were turned off by fast food so that makes the liquid even more unlikely.Btw, according to the white castle website they're 7g fat each, i wonder how much fat yours absorbed from the fat back and how it'd compare.  Also, i think they may have 5 holesJessica - I can't believe you grew up in NYC and have never had them, we grew up making towers of the boxes.

My mom and I stopped in for a quick lunch at Chao Zhou Restaurant Chao Zhou Restaurant, where they are known for very simple home-style food. It's that place with the big red bowl on top of the building, where you'll see piles of people, even at 2am in the morning.We started with the pig intestines which are flavorful and chewy if you can get over the not so visually appealing part. I grew up with this stuff so it doesn't bother me but Lon didn't even like seeing the pictures.I lucked out with something better, their XO sauce (provided on each table). This was the best thing at their restaurant, a very fragrant spiced oil (My mom tells me this stuff is made with meat too.)

Men Kui Tei Men Kui Tei is hidden in a row of restaurants and their name is not displayed, at least not in English. It's a shabby looking place, only a drop above the description of whole-in-the-wall, not the kind of place for a first date. When places like this are cheap and have great food, they gain a special place in my heart, but this place just didn't meet that mark. I had the Tan Tan Ramen, which is the Shoyu Ramen with Spicy Ground Pork, but it wasn't spicy (given as part of the description) and more importantly, the noodles were like any you could buy in a Chinese supermarket. It was otherwise pretty enjoyable, but not very memorable.

Zucchini Apple Bread
CONTENT
It's that transitional time of year, where we still have some summer produce, like zucchini, and fall goodies are coming in, like apples. I decided to make something exactly for this window of time, Zucchini Apple Bread. I also wanted something relatively healthy. Lon and I have been putting on some weight. Relatively is the key, because I never let flavor and texture suffer for health purposes. I don't like fake sugars and fat free baked goods.This recipe yields a wonderfully moist and mildly sweet quickbread, with a very natural flavor. The visible zucchini pieces may even make you feel healthier when eating them. The only problem is that it tastes great, so you may eat too much.Zucchini Apple Bread1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (325 degrees F for convection). Prepare a 9×5x3 loaf pan with non-stick spray.2. In a medium bowl, mix together flour, cinnamon, baking soda, nutmeg, ginger, baking powder, and salt. Set aside.3. In a large bowl, beat together sugar, oil, eggs, and vanilla extract. Stir in the zucchini and apple. Fold in the dry ingredients and the walnuts, just until combined.4. Pour batter into prepared pan and bake until toothpick comes out clean, about 1 hour and 20 minutes. Let it cool in the pan for 15 minutes before removing to finish cooling. Of course I ate some warm, hehe.

Apple season is starting and the farmer's market is starting to fill up with tons of delicious Mutsus, Galas, Ginger Golds, Empires, and more. This is the first time I've seen Sansa Apples and they looked so pretty, I had to give them a try. Ok, even if they weren't pretty, I'd try them. The bright red and yellow apples happen to be perfect for eating fresh. They are crisp, nicely balanced between tart and sweet, and amazingly fragrant. I can just imagine...Sansa perfume, hehe. They run the same prices as most others and I think they're my new favorite eating apple. I love Honey Crisps too but they're rarely available and usually double the price. Remember, an apple a day....

Tong Thai Brasserie
CONTENT
My cousin was in town with his volleyball team and we planned to meet them for dinner on Labor Day. It's hard enough to get a reservation for 8 people in NYC and we had 14. Several places were closed for the holiday, and we were also on a budget. This would be tough. Luckily, Lon and I had walked by Tong Thai Brasserie Tong Thai Brasserie two nights earlier and took notice of their interesting menu and reasonable prices. We called and they took our reservation; we had our fingers crossed.You have heard me complain about Thai in NYC before. I really did not have high hopes but entered thinking, at least I like the space. As Justin, Lon, and I waited for the rest of our party to arrive, we ordered the Duck Leg Confit to tide us over. The skin was crispy, the flavors bold, but just a bit too salty. My eyes were opened though and starting to realize this would not be that average boring Thai that has become so standard here.

I completely agree with Jessica, on every point.  Except, for now, I will call this my favorite bakery in NYC, for a few reasons.  First, everything is baked on site.  Second, the prices (for the pastries we ate) were all reasonable, although, like Jess mentioned, the ones we didn't buy were way expensive.  Third, the setting is just gorgeous (3rd floor of TW center).  Fourth, the service was fast and courteous.  Fifth, as Jess mentioned, dog friendly.I won't mention the fact that the food was very good, because usually for something to be my "favorite" it has to have amazing food.  Their food is not "amazing", but I can't think of where in NYC is better.  Can anyone?  And if anyone plans to mention Venieros, please don't -- you'll just sound silly.

Venieros is poop (please excuse my elementary school level vocab)in my opinion and with the recent health dept shut down it could seriously have poop in the food.But enough bashing and on to a more serious matter. Why aren't there lots of amazing bakeries in this city filled with amazing food? Bakeries are definitely something I love and we're definitely lacking exceptional ones in the city. I haven't found a place where I'm just blown away.Back in the day Mondrian made my favorite cakes, but unfortunately they closed both locations in New York (one was by Bloomies in the city and another in Great Neck). I have searched high and low for Michel Willaume, the pastry chef, but have no idea where he went. Each little cake was a piece of art and were actually named after famous artists, but more importantly each cake tasted like heaven. Nothing I've had comes close to what I used to get there. The closest in the city might be Payard, Brunos, Financier, but all are still very far seconds. None seem to be as delicate or flavorful or creative or just simply delicious as Mondrian. If anyone knows where Michel Willaume went, I would seriously travel to where he is just to be able to have a bite of his marvelous creations.On a brighter note, Sara and I went to the MOMA cafe for lunch this Sunday and had the raspberry mango tart which was surprisingly good. Although there wasn't as much raspberry as I would have liked (for something that had raspberry as part of the name), the custard was made with real vanilla beans! That is always a plus in my book.

I have to disagree, we like the Canales, and have served then to many guests, though, yes, some do not like them. They are "unusual", a bit hard to describe, but quite a wonderful treat hard to reproduce yourself, and with a long history.Sadly our local paper wrote about the Choctal, for VDay 2009, but...forgot to verify the TJ's carries it "seasonally" and they were nowhere to be found, during the winter. I can't wait to try them soon.

Anonymous, as much as I like Trader Joe's, what they carry is not only seasonal, it's just downright sporadic, at least the one on 14th St in NYC. Several times, I have found products I like, go back the next week for it, and it's not there anymore.

Hummus, Quinoa Tabbouleh, and Eggplant Caperberry Salad
CONTENT
As I mentioned in my previous post, I served Moroccan Spiced Chops with Pluot Sauce to Angie and Scott. You don't think that's all I served, do you? Of course not! Meals at our place are always feasts! With that we had Tzatziki (I've posted this recipe before), Hummus, Quinoa Tabbouleh, Eggplant Caperberry Salad, and fresh Pita. Here are the recipes to make your feast!I can't believe I've never posted a hummus recipe. If you have a food processor, it is so easy to make, you'll never pay for store bought versions again. Take this recipe as a guideline, adjusting to your taste. My tahini (which we brought home from Greece) is super dark so here I use 1 tablespoon but you might need more. Keep in mind that the quality of your ingredients will make a big difference here, especially what olive oil you use.HummusPlace chickpeas, lemon juice, tahini, and garlic in the food processor and pulse a few times. Turn the processor on while pouring a continuous stream of olive oil. Scrape down the sides of the processor bowl and pulse a few times. Taste and adjust to your tastes. You can serve or store in the fridge. Return to room temperature and drizzle with olive oil before serving. Sprinkle with paprika if you wish.The Quinoa Tabbouleh recipe is no rocket science. I just decided to use quinoa instead of bulgur because I don't normally have bulgur in stock. It turned out just as light and refreshing.Quinoa Tabbouleh1. Prepare quinoa according to package instructions and set aside and cool completely.2. Toss quinoa with remaining ingredients and serve.1. Cut eggplants into 1″ cubes. Heat the olive oil in a 12″ skillet on medium high heat. Add eggplant and stir until soft and browned, about 7 minutes. Remove from heat and sprinkle with salt.2. In a large serving bowl, toss together eggplant, zest from 1 lemon and juice, caperberries, and parsley. Season with salt and pepper. Garnish with remaining zest before serving.Note: Make this the day before and store in the fridge. Bring back to room temperature and garnish before serving.

Moroccan Spiced Pork Chops with Pluot Sauce
CONTENT
This is an impressive main course to serve to guests (ours were Angie and Scott). The pretty pink sauce is fruity and tangy, a perfect balance for the spicy pork. What's even better about this recipe is that most of the work can be done ahead of time.Moroccan Spiced Pork Chops with Pluot SaucePluot Sauce1. Stir together vinegar, ginger, sugar, star anise, mustard, pepper, cloves, and cinnamon in a small sauce pot. Bring to a boil.2. Turn the heat down to low and add pluots. Cover and cook for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove cover and continue cooking for another 10 minutes. Remove the star anise and cool.1. Preheat your grill. Rub a generous amount of spice blend all over the chops. There will be extra spice left. Set aside and rest at room temperature for 20 minutes.2. Place on the grill for 3 minutes, then rotate 90 degrees but still on the same side for another 3 minutes. Turn over and cook for 3 minutes, then rotate 90 degrees for another 3 minutes. Remove from the grill and rest for 5 minutes. Serve with Pluot Sauce.*cooking times will vary per grill. These times yield a medium-rare to medium cooked chop.To prepare ahead of time, make the Pluot Sauce the day before and store in the fridge. Bring back to room temperature before serving. You can also make the Morrocan Spice Blend any number of days before hand.Update 09/03/08 - We had left over Pluot Sauce and Moroccan Spice blend so I used the same recipe on Red Snapper Filets. It was just as good, so if you don't eat pork, you can use this recipe for fish. I imagine it would be fine with chicken too.

Oxtail Goulash and Spaetzle
CONTENT
I love beef oxtails and try to use it in any beef recipe I can (see my Oxtail and Linguine recipe). It works especially well for soups and stews because the bones give off so much flavor to the liquid. My latest oxtail conquest is Goulash, a Hungarian stew, which Lon grew up with. This is an easy dish that doesn't require too much work, but it does require inactive time. As I sat, waiting for it to finish cooking, I started getting nervous wondering if my Oxtail Goulash would pass the test for Lon (of Hungarian descent) and it did, with flying colors!Oxtail Goulash1. Heat a dutch oven (Le Creuset) with vegetable oil on medium high heat. Add carrots and onions and cook for 2 minutes.2. Add the rest of the ingredients, stir, and bring to a boil. Reduce to a simmer and cook covered for 1 hour, stirring occasionally. Remove the cover and continue to simmer for 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.3. Remove from heat and use a spoon to spoon off the excess oil. Serve.We were inspired by a post on FXCuisine to buy a spaetzle scraper. This is our first time using it and even though I can only vaguely remember the one time I made it in culinary school, I felt daring and wrote my own recipe. This was mainly because I didn't want to go out and buy any ingredients so it had to be made with what we had. The result was just as good as any spaetzle I've eaten.Spaetzle1. Fill a 4 quart pot with water, salt it, and bring to a boil.2. In a medium sized bowl, mix together dry ingredients. Set aside. In a small bowl, mix together half and half and water. Alternate between adding liquid mixture and eggs into the dry mixture. Mix until smooth.3. Turn water down to a simmer. Press dough into a spaetzle scraper over the simmering water and cook for 4-6 minutes. Drain and serve.I threw in some roasted potatoes and it was the ultimate comfort food. We both stuffed ourselves with 2 or more plates like this.

Beets are mostly commonly seen in that deep red color that's very sexy. You've probably encountered the golden ones too, a pretty and cheery yellow. Have you seen the Chioggia Beets? From the outside, they look just like other beets, but a lighter red.On the inside, they are red and white, sometimes with a splash of orange, varying from one to another in terms of color and pattern. Isn't nature just beautiful?

Sushi Yasuda #19
CONTENT
Can you believe it? The 19th visit to Sushi Yasuda marks the first time we did not try a new piece of fish that we had never had before. I'm pretty sure we will still be educated on new pieces in the future, but this visit, I got to concentrate on asking for some notable pieces that I was dying to have again. I do get Peace Passage Oyster every single time I go. It is my absolute favorite piece, without a doubt. You have to try it! I also get orange clam on most weeks but I had been thinking about Sawani, the white sea eel, which I had missed. It is my favorite of their 5 different eel offerings. Lon also loves the salmon skin hand roll, and we both wanted the fatty tuna cheek, but they were out of it. We'll have to remember that for next week.This evening (which was last night), the Spanish Mackerel also seemed different, a lot softer, and a lot fattier, although the general flavor was familiar. I asked Chef Tomura why it was so different and he said every fish is different. He inquired to make sure I was happy with it, which I certainly was - fatty Spanish mackerel? Yum! His simple explanation makes a lot of sense, and makes me feel less bad that I still can't visually identify certain pieces yet (especially between white fishes).Happy Labor Day Weekend!

Raspberry Swirl Brownies
CONTENT
A little less than a year ago, I left my last office job (ever, I hope). I haven't really kept in touch with my old co-workers, but oddly, I am still good friends with the office that was down the hall. The small boutique office of Signature Bank was just the coolest little group that I really enjoyed eating lunch with almost daily. I went back to visit them yesterday, had lunch with Anthony, but of course I had to bring them something. Brownies are one of those easy to transport things that you should keep in your repertoire. These are just a little extra special because they've got a raspberry swirl.When I got home, I got an e-mail from my friend Anthony:Raspberry Swirl Brownies1. Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (275 degrees F with convection). Spray a 8″ square, glass dish with non-stick spray.2. In a small bowl, combine flour, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.3. In a medium saucepan, combine sugar, butter, and water. Bring to a boil while stirring. Remove from heat and whisk in the chocolate. Stir in the flour mixture and spread evenly in the pan.4. In a small microwave safe bowl, microwave the preserves for about 20 seconds, or until just loose enough to work with. Drop 5 large spoonfuls onto the chocolate batter. Swirl with a knife.5. Bake for 25-30 minutes, until brownies look set. Don not over-bake. Cool for 10 minutes before trying to cut.Notes:

I've been to Zeytuna before, but this was my first time sitting on the cafe side, with service and a full menu. My friend Anthony and I thought the prices were quite reasonable considering the outdoor seating in such a location Zeytuna. It was a bright and sunny day, and the umbrellas over the cafe were red, creating a red hue in all my pictures.I was surprised by the generous bread and olive offering. I guess it's because I didn't think of this as a real cafe because it's connected to a market, but it pretty much is. I had some focaccia which was a bit dry. Oh well.

Lon's Birthday Basket: Honey Habanero Grilling Sauce
CONTENT
I was out all yesterday afternoon, looking at apartments (yes, still looking), so dinner had to be simple. Luckily, we had this Braswell's Select Honey Habanero Grilling Sauce from Lon's birthday basket. It only took a few minutes to skewer up some pork kebabs, drenched in the grilling sauce, and stick them on the grill.

Pluot Torte
CONTENT
I bought a large amount of beautiful Dinosaur Eggs (or Pluots) and decided to try baking some. I figured I wouldn't find an exact recipe for these so I just took a plum torte recipe, adjusted, and hoped for the best. It's a little tart, very pretty, and almost too easy to make. Save this one for when you're in a time crunch.Pluot Torte~adapted from Marion Burros Plum Torte1. Arrange a rack in the lower third of the oven. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (325 degrees F).2. In an electric mixer, cream together 3/4 cup sugar and butter. Add flour, baking powder, eggs, and salt. Beat well.3. Spread in a 9″ ungreased springform pan. Place plums skin side down evenly across batter.4. Mix cinnamon with the 1 tablespoon of sugar left. Sprinkle over the plums evenly.5. Bake for 40-50 minutes, until a toothpick comes out clean. Let it cool for 10 minutes before eating. It can be served warm or room temperature, highly recommended with vanilla ice cream. Store it in the fridge in an airtight container.

Remember the Spinach one I had in Greece?On a side note, the service is very friendly but I'm pretty sure I got a regular coffee even though I asked for decaf. Also, Lon remembers there bagels being pretty good, but hasn't been there in at least two years.

Lon's Birthday Basket: Crisp Baked Crackers and Pomegranate Blueberry Sparkling Lemonade
CONTENT
Lon has made it clear to his family, never to buy him a present unless it's edible. He hates clutter and is particular about clothing. He generally just wants to prevent his family from wasting money on stuff he'll likely throw away. This year, his mom and brother put together a basket of interesting foods so we're kicking it off with two items:Elsa's Story, Crisp Baked Crackers, Garlic FlavoredEfferve, Pomegranate Blueberry Sparkling LemonadeThis cool bottle was well carbonated, popping like champagne when we first opened it. The all natural flavor was a nice balance between sweet and tart, mostly pomegranate and blueberry, no noticeable lemon. It's a nice non-alcoholic option for celebrations.There's a lot more in this basket...

Yellowfin Un-Salad Nicoise
CONTENT
I happened to have tuna, string beans, and potatoes and I thought, perfect for a Nicoise. But, I wasn't excited. Nicoise is pretty boring. So here's my anti-Nicoise, still healthy, but a little Asian influence thrown in for fun. It's actually three different dishes assembled together to make a yummy dinner. Each is very easy on it's own. They key is to time it out for all three to be ready at once.Yellowfin Un-Salad Nicoise~ dinner for twoMarinated Tuna Steaks1. Place tuna steaks in a container that is large enough for them not to overlap, but too much space is not good either.2. Mix together grapefruit vinegar, olive oil, ginger, garlic.and pour over tuna steaks. Refrigerate for two hours, turning over once.3. Heat a small non-stick pan, sprayed with non-stick, over high heat. Season tuna steaks and sear for 2 minutes on each side.4. Slice and serve.Garlic Scallion Potatoes1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.2. Toss potatoes with 1 teaspoon olive oil and garlic. Season generously. Roast in the oven on a aluminum covered sheet pan for about 15 minutes. Turn potatoes, sprinkle scallions and the other teaspoon of olive oil. Bake for another 15 minutes. Potatoes are ready when fork tender.String Beans with Oyster SauceHeat a small wok (or saute pan if you don't have a wok) with oil on high heat. Stir fry string beans for a few seconds. Add oyster sauce and continue to stir-fry. When you cannot see any more oil in the pan, add the water. (Be careful as the hot steam comes up.) Stir around a bit more and string beans should be done.

Strawberry Poppy Muffins
CONTENT
This is what happens when you think about food so much, your wires get crossed. I just picked up some strawberries from my local fruit guys and started thinking about a strawberry salad with poppy seed dressing. In the back of my mind, I had been thinking about mini-muffin tin, that hasn't been used in months. I had been trying not to use it, afraid I would bore you all with my mini obsession. Somehow Strawberry Poppy Muffins popped into my head and here you have it. They are super light, a teeny bit tangy, with a nice crunch, and dangerous; I think I could eat all 34 at once.Strawberry Poppy Muffins~makes 34 mini muffins1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (325 degrees F for convection). Spray a mini muffin pan with non-stick spray.2. Sift together flour, baking powder, and salt in a medium sized bowl.3. In a large bowl, whisk together yogurt, sugar, eggs, oil, zest, and vanilla.4. Fold the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients, just until combined . Fold the strawberries and poppy seeds in gently.5. Fill the muffin tin and bake for about 14 minutes, until toothpick comes out clean. Let them cool in the tin for 5 minutes before removing to a cooling rack.

Soba with Spicy Tofu and Edamame
CONTENT
This recipe has been swimming around in my head for a while, editing back and forth, with nothing written down. I finally let it materialize and I'm very happy with it. Even Mr. Soba-hater, Lon, gave me the thumbs up. It's really refreshing and perfect for summer so make sure to try it before fall comes around.Soba with Spicy Tofu and Edamame1. Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (275 degrees F for convection).2. Drain the tofu and slice it in 8 equal pieces (the short way). Lay it on a plate. Place another plate on top, then something heavy on top. (Depending on the size of your plates, you may have to add another plate/layer, like I do.) Let it sit for 20 minutes, then drain the liquid. Let it sit for another 20 minutes and drain again.3. Spread a thin layer of red pepper paste on each side of the tofu.4. Bake for 1 hour on a cookie sheet covered in aluminum foil (sprayed with non-stick spray). When done, let it cool completely. Then, cut into 1/2″ cubes.5. While the tofu is baking, mix together soy sauce, mirin, vinegar, sesame oil, and ginger in a small bowl. Set aside.6. In a large bowl, combine soba, edamame, tofu, and scallions. You can assemble ahead of time but dress and toss with dressing when ready to serve.

Dr. Food, freezing tofu gives it a completely different texture and it's actually a popular Chinese way to make tofu. Literally translated, the name is frozen tofu, although it's defrosted before using. It becomes sponge-like, making it great for soups.

Coney Island on a Saturday Morning
CONTENT
What were you doing yesterday (Saturday) at 6:15am? I hope sleeping... because the alternative is, well, um, not sleeping. And that's what we were doing. In fact, we were driving down to Coney Island, so Jessica could jump in the water with other Team in Training Triathalon Trainees (plus coaches, lifeguards, and others). Me and Ice (our dog) went with Jessica to cheer her on. Ice also joined in on half of the 45 minute run after the swim.While Jessica was in the water, Ice played catch with me in the parking lot (dogs aren't allowed off leash on the boardwalk). I noticed a few interesting vending machines in that lot Stillwell Ave Boardwalk Entrance. One of them was a machine that purported to make \"fresh grilled\" hot dogs fast. And humorously, had a notice that the company Hot Nosh was open \"24/6″ (the one missing is Shabbas), but then below said \"Any time. Anywhere.\" Anyway, my attention wasn't so much on the inconsistency as the idea of getting a vending machine grilled hot dog. But for $3? Eh, it just wasn't worth it, I passed. Jessica was pleased with that news.Everything was closed when we got there, but around 10am, when we were getting ready to leave, some stores were opening, most importantly the well known Nathan's Original Hot Dog stand Nathan's Original. It was early in the day, but how often do I get down to Coney Island? I had to have one, it had been years. I ran in and found half her training team in there! Health? Pshha.. Anyway, the line moved quickly, and I ordered a \"Regular Hot Dog\" (which is the simplest thing they have), and found it was........ $3.00!!! Jeez. I should've given that vending machine a shot!It was a decent tasting hot dog, the meat was mediocre, while the casing was good and crisp, bursting with each bite. However, the bun, while grilled, was way too big for the skinny hot dog. It was roughly the size of three pencils taped together. I felt like I could eat 59.5 of these in 12 minutes! It is WAY not worth the money, even for history.I also ordered Cheese Fries for Jessica (she loves cheese fries). But it didn't occur to me that they would use the crappy \"cheeze\" sauce, which is basically oil and yellow #5, Jessica is allergic to food coloring. She ate some anyway, and in the end it didn't matter. We both felt the fries were mushy and wet from cheese. There wasn't a hint of crispness that one hopes for in a french fry. These were more of baked potato wedges with cheese. The up-side was that they weren't at all greasy, as expected.While the hot dog was way over-priced, the fries were a good price for the huge order. Across the street from Nathan's was a Chicago-based hot dog stand. We will be heading back to Coney Island in two weeks for more training, Jessica for more swimming, and me for more eating. Hopefully the Chicago stand will be open.If you love FoodMayhem, you can show your support by donating to Jessica's Team in Training page! She is doing the Westchester Triathlon on September 21st to raise money for the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society. Thanks for your support!

We were just in Coney last week and ate at Nathan's.  I have to say it's a surprisingly clean place and seems to be well run.  However it is expensive and the quality is nothing to write home about.  I saw the Chicago place too, but it was closed as of 11am on a Thursday, so I don't know when they do their business.  The Nathan's fries are soaked in oil.  I would suggest heading East and going to Brighton Beach for some Russian food (that's what we'll do next time we hit the beach).

On our last trip to Woodbury Commons we saw quite a few of those vending machines - all Kosher.  One was dairy offering sandwiches like eggplant parm panini ('fresh - not microwaved') and veggie burgers.  Another more app/snacks like mozzarella sticks and onion rings. And a third was meat with things like grilled chicken panini. Had I not just eaten I would have tried it just for the interest factor.

Dinner: Mustard Thick-Cut Chops, Sauteed Mushrooms and Green Beans, Colorful Bruschetta, and Roasted Fingerlings with Manchego Walnut Pesto
CONTENT
This dinner was all about simplicity. Every preparation was easy and the highlight is the ingredients. When you're using really good meat, ultra fresh vegetables, and super vinegars, oils, etc. you don't need to get fancy. Let the ingredients do all the work.Ready for the easiest recipe ever?Mustard Thick-Cut ChopsPreheat your grill. Rub the mustard all over the two chops and season. Lay on grill for 12 minutes at the hottest point on the grill (rotating 90 degrees after 6 minutes for grill marks). Turn it over and grill on a less hot area for another 6 minutes (rotating 90 degrees after 3 minutes for grill marks). Cooking times will vary per grill.Easy huh? I sauteed some green beans and sliced white mushrooms with garlic and olive oil. You don't need a recipe for that right?For the Bruschetta, fresh produce is key. The quality of the balsamic vinegar and the olive oil will also be the difference between a good Bruschetta and one you want for the next four days in a row. Trust me. It can really brighten your day.Colorful BruschettaToss all the ingredients together in a medium sized bowl. Serve with toasted Ciabatta or Baguette slices.Roasted Fingerlings with Manchego Walnut PestoI didn't write down the exact recipe for this one (brain lapse) but here's the recipe for the pesto (makes a lot more than you will use for the potatoes). Just toss potatoes with a generous amount of pesto to coat all the pieces and roast in the oven, roughly 40 minutes at 375 degrees F.Manchego Walnut PestoPut the basil, walnuts, garlic, and Manchego in the food processor and pulse a few times. Then turn the processor on while pouring the oil in a steady stream. Season to taste. Store in your fridge for up to two weeks and you can freeze for months.

Blueberry Crumb Cake
CONTENT
It's Friday so I decided to make myself a treat. OK, fine, I make dessert close to daily but who's counting? (Actually, our scale is and he's telling me to stop it asap.) Not feeling creative today, so I just pulled out my trusty Perfect Cakes book, by Nick Malgieri and made his Blueberry Crumb Cake. He says it's one of his favorites and that sells it for me.It is a wonderful light cake, perfect for a breakfast or brunch, only mildly sweet and the blueberries are left to their natural flavors. I'm sure I'll be making these again.

When CSC made her version of a blueberry crumb cake, the blueberries, for some reason, were all on the bottom. Yours, the blueberries are nicely on top. Weird eh?The cake looks great and this is one of my favourites to have for an afternoon snack.

Grace, when I'm not feeling creative pr inspired, I don't write my own recipe. I find it relaxing to use a good cookbook once in a while.JS, In this recipe, the batter is spread in the pan first, then the blueberries are just sprinkled on top, then the crumb layer. The batter CSC used may not be dense enough to prevent the sinking.

Inside the Despana Basket: Valor Dark Chocolate with Toffee
CONTENT
We got this bar of Valor Dark Chocolate (70%) with Toffee in our Despana Basket, but if you see it anywhere, buy it!70% dark chocolate is my favorite way to eat chocolate but I'm not a huge fan of toffee so I wasn't expecting to love it so much. The balance is perfect though, only adding a hint of flavor and a little bit of crunch, leaving it as mostly pure chocolate goodness. Lon loves it too, describing it as a gourmet Nestle Crunch.I was planning on chopping it up and baking some cookies but now I can't do it. I need to eat it as is and savor every bite.

Sushi Yasuda #18
CONTENT
Can you believe it's been 3 weeks since the last visit to Sushi Yasuda. How ever did I live through that? I don't know, but we did made sure to make reservations for next week on our way out. I wonder if Chef Tomura has gotten more popular because of our blog because it has gotten harder to get reservations with him.Well, distance makes the heart grow fonder, and as Lon, Sara, and I sat there enjoying the sushi, we oo'd and aah'd over and over again. Everything was fresh and delicious. We did get two new pieces. First, scorpian fish. I'm sorry I forgot my camera but it looks just like any other white fish, but has a better texture than most, a bit more firm, yet no problem to bite through. We finally got Coho Salmon, which was so flavorful and melts into your mouth. Yum! Oh, and a bright, almost electric orange color.If you haven't tried Sushi Yasuda yet, you are totally missing out!

Chorizo Manchego Olive Corn Muffins
CONTENT
Not only was our Despana Basket an amazing assortment, there was a generous portion of each item, enough for us to really experiment with. I was sitting here trying to figure out what else I could make with all these great ingredients and I decided on savory muffins: Chorizo Manchego Olive Corn Muffins.Chorizo Manchego Olive Corn Muffins~makes 241. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (325 degrees F for convection) and line muffin tin with papers.2. In a large bowl, beat together butter and sugar. Add one egg at a time, beating after each addition.3. Mix in cream-style corn, olives, chorizo, and Manchego.4. In a seperate bowl, stir together flour, cornmeal, baking powder, and salt. Stir the dry mixture into the wet mixture until even.5. Spoon into 24 muffin cups, roughly 4/5 full. Bake for 22-25 minutes or until a toothpick comes out dry.While they were baking, I sat around nervously like someone waiting for a newborn. Would these babies be soft with a nice crumb? Would the flavors work together? Yes! Yes! It was awesome! Lon and I are each guilty of eating two around midnight, last night. =/

Haw Flakes
CONTENT
I saw Haw Flakes in a Chinese market on Monday and I was instantly brought back to childhood. These were the candies I ate and shared with friends, while playing jump rope and tag in the school yard. I'd often have a little package or two stuck in my pockets, sometimes melting into a gooey mess during hot summer days. How could I have forgotten about Haw Flakes?Looking at it now, it's funny, I had no idea what Haw was (fruit of Chinese Hawthorn) bit I still loved these candies. The dry little discs might seem weird, like dehydrated fruit roll-ups, punched out into circles, that almost look like cardboard. If you just give it a shot, they'll start to melt into your tongue, giving off more and more flavor, kind of like tangy berries. If you bite them, they tend to stick between your teeth. I love it, maybe more for nostalgic reasons. Sadly, I can't really eat them anymore (because I'm allergic to artificial food coloring) and Lon wasn't thrilled with it, but I still recommend trying them.

It was OK before and still OK now, nothing super but some good Chinese standbys for dirt cheap prices. I had the classic lunch of Three Roast Meats Over Rice. The Soy Sauce Chicken was average. The Roast Pork was too lean and not caramelized at the edges enough. The Roast Duck was quite good. The main highlight is still that this plate was under $5.

Breakfast Trifle
CONTENT
Lon's mom and brother got us 10 ounce mini trifle dishes. So instead of throwing yogurt and fruit in a bowl, like I've been doing most mornings, I decided to make a Breakfast Trifle. Why spend the extra time and effort? Because treating yourself to something special makes you feel good. It's like wearing sexy underwear, even if no one will see it. Secondly, it looks like a dessert. Not only is that fun, but mental satisfaction allows most people to eat less. Yet, the Breakfast Trifle can be as healthy as you want it to be.My Breakfast TrifleI put 1/4 cup of chopped strawberries on the bottom, then 1/3 of the yogurt, then 1/4 cup of chopped cherries, another 1/3 of the yogurt, then Honey Bunches of Oats, the last of the yogurt, topped with the rest of the strawberries and cherries.Treat yourself to a sexy breakfast!

Steakhouse Dinner at Home
CONTENT
When I make shopping trips out to Queens, my mom always does me the favor of driving me and my load back to my apartment. Since she's making the drive to the city, I figure it's a good opportunity for her to have dinner at our place. Conveniently, my dad and brother can come after work and join us. The only problem is that these are meals that we have to whip up very quickly. We usually arrive, unpack, and have dinner within 30 minutes.I usually don't write about these meals because I don't have time to write any recipes and this night was no different, but you don't need a recipe. That's how easy this meal was. So when you need a quick, yet satisfying, almost glorious meal, here's what you need: steaks, onions, mushrooms, parsley, bread, salad ingredients of your choice. (I'm assuming you have basics like butter, salt, and pepper.) This makes you a Steakhouse-like meal in no time for way less money.Buy whatever kind of steak you like. Tonight, I wanted Ribeye Steaks. Look at the marbling! We threw them on our grill but you can do it with a pan, broiler, or whichever way you like your steak.

Bill, I don't know for sure but some aging does seem to be part of the making process. However, it's common for people to not call it aged when the time period is insignificant, as with many cheaper supermarket bottles of Balsamic. I do apologize, since I should be more specific. The one I was talking about was aged 12 years (from O & Co.)

TITLE
Don't Burn the Food!
CONTENT
While first learning to cook, I burnt food on a fairly regular basis. And I've heard from many home cooks that they still run into the occasional burnt food crisis. It can happen to the best of us -- all it requires is a bit of heat and taking your eye off the pan for a bit too long. As I've become more practiced, burning food has become almost a non-issue. But it almost happened this morning, and I saved my dish in the last moments. So I thought I'd jot a few notes down not so much about avoiding burning food (although I'll say a few words on that), but rather about how to undo almost-burnt food.\"Almost\" is the key word up there. Once food is truly burnt, the only place it belongs is in the compost heap. So what's the difference between burnt and almost burnt? 30 seconds. (drum rap-a-tap here). Foods have sugars, and when you apply heat to the sugars they brown via the Maillard reaction, a process I covered in detail in my Treatise on Grilling. This reaction occurs when the moisture is gone from the surface. The more the reaction occurs (typically due to a continuing heat source), the more moisture is draw out from the food. The result is dry, burnt food. Yuck!As the reaction occurs a good amount of the sugars in the food deposit themselves upon the heating surface, this is known in the food industry as fond. And to the untrained eye it may look like burnt garbage, but if treated correctly it is the basis for the most wonderful sauces. And fond is what will save your dish! (Hence my mentioning it)Now for a quick pause on saving your burnt dish, to talk about avoiding burning food. The best way to save your dish from burning, is to avoid burning altogether! It's not very hard. Here are five quick tips that will help you avoid burning:Let's further define \"almost burnt\" -- it's when your browning has advanced so that almost everything in the dish is brown and when your food is just not done cooking. In other words, it's getting close to burnt, but you've got a few more minutes (or more) of cooking to do, to get your food to the right temperature.Now, here's the part you've been waiting for... ideas for how to save your dishes.The first step is to reduce the heat a bit. You need to slow down the cooking process and cook for a longer period of time. This is where science kicks in. Without going into details, the basis for the trick is to take advantage of the heating curve and thermodynamics of food. It helps to understand how heat and time affect the tenderness and flavor of food, which one learns with experience. But, there is a great research article (warning: PDF) from 1993 by the American Society of Animal Science on the palatability of muscle, it is very closely related to this topic.Ok, so we've lowered the heat being applied. Now we need to add moisture, which can also help lower the temperature and pause the Maillard reaction. Depending on what you're cooking you can use different liquids. Potential choices include wine (dry is better in this case, you've already got enough sugar in the pan), vinegar (keep it dry, balsamic is too sweet), stock (chicken, beef, vegetable are all fine), heck, even water can be your savior. Using something right out of the fridge is preferable, but room temperature is ok.Next, use a non-abrasive tool (like a wooden spatula, or plastic spoon) to scrape all the fond (burnt bits) off the bottom of your pan. Try to break up any big bits. The goal is to get the fond to dissolve into the newly added liquid. You've basically built up a sauce.You should have a wetter, cooler pan. Now we're going to take things a step further, we're going to change cooking technique. If you almost burnt your food, it was probably because you were focusing on direct heat (searing, frying, sauteing, etc.). You've got to try to more evenly distribute the heat by adding indirect heat (convection and steaming). That means: put a lid on it! The lid will cause heated air to circulate around the enclosed area; and it will cause the new liquid's steam to stay near your food. The nice thing about steam (uh oh, more thermodynamics here) is that it stays at high temperature, while requiring about half the heat energy of boiling water. That means the lowered heat source's energy will expend 66% of it's energy cooking your food and 33% keeping the steam super hot.After a few minutes, check your food again. It's time to taste. Adding the liquid likely altered the seasoning and you're very likely going to need to add some salt and other seasonings.Whew, that was more than I meant to write, but I hope it helps and saves some of your future dishes! Let's review...First, try to avoid burning by:If your food is almost burnt:Good luck out there!

Thanks. very useful tips. 'keep your eye on the food' is the key I guess. At least while multi tasking. A number of Indian dishes require onion as the base. Oil is poured in first so that the onions don't burn. I am fgured a good way to circumvent this. I grind the onions in a processor till it becomes a liquidy pulp. I then uses this as a cooking base. So you end up having something which is quite 'Indian' and yet oil free. Following this up with ginger and garlic paste helps

Knife, good tip.  You've basically / kind-of figured out sofrito.  It's a base for cooking used in most Latin types of dishes.  Sofrito adds peppers, and garlic (in its most basic form) or can have other ingredients.  But the goal is exactly what you said: you process onions and the other aromatics to get a liquidy mash, and start cooking with that.However, from there, once the moisture is evaporated most Latin cooks add lots of oil.

Sofrito? Thanks Lon... I had no idea. I went to by my instincts and was trying to see how to cut out oil and yet have good food. I belong to the Bengali communcity in India. Most Bengalis have a soft corner for the Latin American way of playing soccer. For me 'Sofrito' is the 6th degree

Mexicana Mama Centro
CONTENT
Mexicana Mama Centro Mexicana Mama Centro opened up a few blocks from us, and became a last minute resort for dinner when our plans changed. We grabbed one of the three little tables outside and enjoyed the perfect weather this evening, starting with a Salsa Piquin (the salsa of the day) with tortilla chips. We do think it's a little cheap for a Mexican restaurant to charge for chips and salsa but we would pay the $4.50 for this salsa again. It was like a Mexican spiced Vodka Sauce, a little sweet, tomato-y and creamy. Interestingly, there's no dairy in it but the nice emulsification was deceiving.

How to Use Oil to Fix a Leek
CONTENT
No... we haven't become a mechanic blog, this post is about making Fried Leek Rings. A few years ago I saw Alton Brown make some delicious looking Leek Rings. I was inspired, but never got around to making them myself, until this week!Jessica picked up some beautiful leeks from the Union Square Farmer's market, and asked me to make dinner last night, while she trained for her upcoming triathalon. She had defrosted some Mahi Mahi (from Trader Joes) and that was the protein, and sitting next to it in the fridge were some mini bell peppers -- I was getting inspired.I didn't care much for Alton's recipe (sorry Alton, you're awesome anyway), so I made my own. Here it goes, my recipe writing is still in practice mode, so my measurements are not nearly as accurate as Jessica's...Fried Leek RingsIngredientsDirections5. Fry the leeks for about 2.5 -3 minutes until golden. Remove to a sheet pan covered in paper towel. Season immediately with salt. Repeat with remaining leeks.These were exceptionally delicious!! Jessica ate half of them as they came out of the oil... and her stomach hurt later (a rarity). I finished up quite a bit more. This recipe makes enough to be a side dish for at least six people.I served them with the mahi mahi, which I topped with a sauteed mixture of leeks, mixed mini bell peppers, bacon, black pepper, parsley, and white wine vinegar. It was a wonderful dinner that filled us both!For more delicious pictures of dinner, check out the Flickr set.

breaking the leeks apart seems like a lot of work.  I had a friend who used to saute leeks with butter, salt, sugar and pepper  and they were amazing (carmelized, etc.), but I never learned how to do it (I was a child), I don't know why my leeks never come out nearly as good.  Man, I loves to eat me some leeks.

I bought a package of Sweet Apple Chicken Sausage from Trader Joe's. They were giving it out on my last visit and I guess I was sold. (That doesn't happen to me often. ) After lugging the groceries back to our apartment, I found Lon sitting at his computer. Apparently their office had an Internet outage so he was home. Yay! It's always more fun to make lunch for two.I wanted to make a cabbage relish to go with the sausages but I didn't want it to be so potent that you couldn't eat more than just a smear on the sausage. It was going to act as the vegetable portion in our meal too so, here it is, a Red Cabbage Relish-ish. It was exactly what I had hoped for and we each ate a big pile of it.Red Cabbage Relish-ish~4-5 servings1. Heat oil in a large skillet on medium high heat.2. Add onions and stir until starting to soften, about 1 minute.3. Add shredded cabbage and stir.4. Add mango butter and stir until evenly distributed.5. Add cider vinegar and sprinkle with salt. Cover and continue to cook, stirring occasionally, for at least 20 minutes. Check periodically to see if the liquid has been absorbed. You may need to add 1/4 cup of water to continue cooking.

Inside the Despana Basket: Pimientos in Olive Oil and Quick Chicken Chorizo Rice
CONTENT
I didn't realize until I opened this jar of Pimientos, from our Despana Basket, that it was packed in olive oil. I normally buy the ones jarred with brine. The olive oil does add a bit of flavor and the fat coats your tongue nicely if eaten alone. I'm not sure it makes a big difference when cooked in a rice dish. It certainly doesn't hurt though.I wanted to make a quick one-pot meal tonight, having stood all day, and just not in the mood for experimenting. Lon just came in from the pouring rain, completely soaked, and I wanted something comforting, guaranteed to warm him up. Well, this dish worked, a cheaper and easier version of Paella, because these are the ingredients I had. We finished the whole thing, which was really meant to be dinner and his lunch for tomorrow.Quick Chicken Chorizo Rice ~3 servings1. Heat oil in a 11″ skillet (2 1/2″ deep) over medium high heat. Add onions & cook until starting to soften, about 2 minutes. 2. Add chicken. Season with salt and pepper and stir until the outsides of the chicken pieces are cooked, about 2min. 3. Add chorizo and stir for another 2minutes. 4. Add pimientos and rice, stirring until rice is coated with oil and pan juices. 5. Stir in two cups of chicken broth and bring to boil. Reduce to a simmer and cook covered until liquid is absorbed, about 12 minutes. 6. Stir in frozen peas, which will cook in less than a minute. 7. Remove the rice dish to a serving platter and toss tomatoes on top.

Elettaria
CONTENT
Months ago, Angie and Winnie went to Elettaria Elettaria, ordered too much food, and decided to bring their doggie bag to us. From then on, Elettaria has been on our restaurant wish list but you know how that goes. If only there were 8 meals in a day....Well, waiting so long is our loss. It was a memorable meal, where excellent ingredients and expert execution, was outshined by the inventiveness that really won us over.Starting with the complimentary and refillable Naan, we were already impressed. It was a denser and doughier Naan, served warm (mmm...) with a yogurt-based cumin dip. Trying not to fill up on bread was a challenge I was losing.Lon's favorite was the Pork Ribs, heavily spiced with garam masala, meat falling off the bone, and the sweet yogurt sauce just blew it away. The shredded snap peas added a refreshing touch.Our waiter recommended his personal favorite, the Dayboat Sea Scallops, which were cooked perfectly, and the sweetest (in a natural way) scallops I've had. Hidden underneath was a small piece of bacon fat that melted in you mouth, seductive and sinful.The Vegetable Dosas were really pretty, crispy and neatly folded, reminding me of a vegetable strudel. The highlight here was that the vegetables inside and out were al dente and screamed fresh.The winning entree was the Duck, prepared in two way. The duck breast slices were a little less pink than I like but they were so tender that I didn't mind. The ground duck added great bites of extra flavor and Lon couldn't stop raving about the nettles.

I'm so glad you guys enjoyed it. Its on my top 20 list. I just love the creativity and the nice sized portions are a plus. I also like the space. If you like Elettaria you might also enjoy Degustation. I think I wrote you a really long email once about it. The portions are a bit smaller, but its also pretty creative and its fun because you basically sit around the kitchen and watch them prepare everything in sushi bar fashion.

Green Tea Pound Cake
CONTENT
To follow up with my post on Maeda-en Matcha (Green Tea Powder), I used it today to make a Green Tea Pound Cake. Nick Malgieri's recipe (from Perfect Cakes) calls for 2 tablespoons, roughly half of the $10 container. As opposed to the outstanding green tea ice cream, I don't think the expensive green tea is worth it for pound cake. It doesn't get to shine here. Don't get me wrong; the pound cake is still a nice way to start your morning, but I think a cheaper green tea powder would do just fine. I will be testing some cheaper matcha powders soon.

Vegetable Tamago Rolls
CONTENT
Last night, we threw together a bunch of things for dinner but it seemed so carb-heavy. I tried to conjure up a way to add protein and veggies to our meal and somehow this idea came to mind. I loved it so much that I decided to make it again for lunch, tweaking the recipe just a bit to make the rolls a bit smaller, and therefore easier to eat.Vegetable Tamago Rolls~2 appetizer portions or 1 lunch portionLet's talk about the ingredients first: The measurement for the julienned veggies (matchstick size) is a very rough estimate. It's hard to measure that shape.I also want to apologize for having an ingredient called \"seaweed stuff\". We bought this mixture of seaweed, sesame oil, sugar, sesame, and salt at M2M and it doesn't have an English name. The packaging is covered in Korean. Can someone help us out?Lastly, if you have the foresight, take your eggs out and leave them on the counter to come to room temperature. You'll get a more tender egg, but not a big deal, I didn't.1. In a small bowl, whisk together eggs, soy sauce, sugar, and mirin. Split the mixture in half (roughly 1/4 cup each).2. Heat a 8″ non-stick omelet pan with non-stick spray, over medium heat and pour in half of egg mixture. Tilt the pan side to side, and around, until the mixture coats the pan. Keep tilting around while heating until liquid does not travel anymore. Using a temperature resistant spatula, test the egg mixture gently to see if it is firm enough to flip. Turn it over as gently as possible and remove from the pan after just a few seconds.3. Repeat step 2 with the other half of the egg mixture and let both pieces cool on a flat surface.4. Cut each egg into 3 strips as evenly as possible. Take 1 tablespoons of seaweed stuff and crumble over each egg strip.5. Lay the carrots across and then the cucumber, leaving a little room at the end.

Vacuum Sealed Drummette, Chicken Feet, and Duck Feet!
CONTENT
My friend, Lily, brought some rather interesting treats back from China for me: packaged meats? They were all individually vacuum sealed, making me wonder if people in China brought these with them as snacks. You could easily toss one in your purse. It could even fit in your pocket.Lon was only willing to try the chicken drummette, which was jerky-like and mostly skin with just a bit of meat. It tasted very artificial, only mildly chicken flavored, and a little like candy.

Abraco
CONTENT
This tiny unlabeled (well the door is labeled but not the awning) coffee spot called Abraco Abraco had a mini line going on Sunday morning. It reminded me a little bit of Blue Bottle Coffee Co. in San Francisco, with the little counter outside, already filled with people standing around, enjoying their coffees and frittatas (which looked really good, mental note for next time). Even the clientèle made it feel more like SF, with several white guy/Asian girl couples (including Lon and myself).As for the Iced Coffee, it was intriguing. It was a little more acidic than my usual preference but for some reason, it really really worked here. The flavor was robust and lively, and the acidity played nicely against the cream, making me rather addicted to it. Ok, I'm going to venture to say it's the best Ice Coffee in NYC.The Olive Oil Cake, which I think they are known for, was very good, very moist, and goes nicely with coffee. I don't know if I think it's good enough to be known for though.

Almond Crunch French Toast
CONTENT
After experimenting with Almond Crunch French Toast last week, I mentioned that I'd post up the recipe this weekend, after some minor adjustments. Here it is! I used Challah this week and Chinese Bakery Bread last week. Both are good: Challah will be a bit softer, Chinese Bakery Bread a bit more dense and firm. I wrote 13 ounces of Challah but it's just however many 1″ slices fit into a 9X13 pan, snuggly. See Pic.Almond Crunch French ToastFrench ToastAlmond Crunch Topping1. Arrange challah slices in a 9X13 pan (with non-stick spray), snuggly fit.2. In a large bowl, whisk together milk, eggs, sugar, vanilla extract, almond extract, and cinnamon. Pour over the challah and let is soak for 1 hour, turning over once. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (325 degrees F with convection) during this time.3. Mix together light brown sugar, quick oats, flour, and cinnamon. Rub in butter until mixture is crumbly. Toss together with almonds. Spread evenly on top of challah slices.6. Bake for 25 minutes, or until top is golden brown.Isn't this beautiful? Tender French Toast, crunchy aromatic almonds, lightly sweetened...my idea of perfection.I made Peach Compote to top it off this evening, but last week I used a strawberry compote. Both were delicious so I've given you both recipes. Those who like it sweeter may also want to serve it with Maple Syrup.Peach compoteIn a medium saucepan, stir together peaches, brown sugar, water, brandy, cinnamon, and nutmeg over medium heat. While stirring occasionally, cook until the liquid reduces to a syrup, about 15 minutes. Serve warm or room temperature.Strawberry CompoteToss strawberries, sugar, and Grand Marnier together and let is sit for at least 30 minutes. It can be made 2-3 hours ahead if desired.I've got to make this for my mom next time!

Da Bhang Cafe
CONTENT
I asked Lily to meet me at Da Bhang Cafe Da Bhang Cafe after reading some rave reviews on Yelp. After placing our order, we decided to sit outside, where they have two 2-seaters. It was just too dark inside for the bright and beautiful summer day. (Am I the only person who doesn't enjoy cafes and restaurants in darkness?)So, their low-fat frozen yogurt gets points for being organic but it was still more like a yogurt flavored icy. It isn't at all creamy, closest to Red Mango, so if you like that...We liked the Green Tea Bing Soo (Korean Shaved Ice) more. The green tea ice cream, red beans, and condensed milk made a nice combination but we both thought the ice granules were just a bit large, requiring a bit too much effort for crunching. Ultimately, it just wasn't worth the steep $8. Remember the Shaved Ice, I just got in Flushing? That was $3.75. Even factoring in Manhattan, good English speaking service, and a nicer bowl, I'm not convinced this is worth 8 bucks.

The Sugar Almonds in the Despana Basket, are made by 1880, the same company that makes the Almond Torta, that I loved. These have a hard candy shell that is very sugary, like those candies often given as wedding favors. Sugary is not my thing, but the almonds inside are still undeniably wonderful in a sophisticated way, and beat any domestic version I've had. Still, I'd go with the Almond Torta if you're shopping at Despana.

Chocolate Cheesecake Marbled Cupcakes
CONTENT
I was reading this post on A Southern Grace, and it reminded me of these amazing marbled muffins, sold at a gourmet market near my high school. They called them muffins, but I think it's technically more of an un-frosted cupcake. It's over 10 years since I've had these muffin/cupcakes and the store is no longer there so I decided to make something like it, myself. This recipe uses the cream cheese swirl from Grace's recipe and the cake batter is an improvement on the Chocolate Zucchini Cake I wrote about.Chocolate Cheesecake Marbled Muffins~makes 24Cream Cheese MixtureChocolate Batter1. Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (300 degrees F with convection) and place line muffin tins with muffin paper.2. In a medium sized mixing bowl, beat the cream cheese and butter until light and fluffy.3. Gradually add the sugar and beat until well blended.4. Beat in the egg and then mix in the flour. Set aside.5. In a large bowl, stir together flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking soda, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon. Add the eggs and oil and mix well. Fold in the zucchini. Reserve 1 1/2 cup and set aside.6. Spoon chocolate batter in to muffin cups, about 2/3 full. Drop a tablespoon of cream cheese mixture into each muffin cup and then top with a tablespoon of the reserved chocolate batter. By now, the cupcake tins will look very full so you can try to swirl with a knife carefully but not necessary.7. Bake for 20 minutes or until toothpick comes out pretty clean. It's ok if there is cream cheese mixture on the toothpick but not wet chocolate batter.8. Cool for 5 minutes in the muffin tin. Remove muffins to a cooling rack and completely before eating. I know this is difficult but try!Note: This chocolate batter looks a little weird so don't worry. The oil may also start to separate as it sits. Just mix it back in.I have to admit, these cupcakes aren't 100% perfect, because the cupcake papers get a bit oily. There's even oil left in the tins when you take the cupcakes out. I will try these next time with less oil but I decided to post this recipe anyway, because Lon and I agree, these are freakin' delicious (that's a technical term)!

I know Bill recently made a suggestion and it reminded me I had one too.  Sometimes I've found myself not knowing how to make some basic dishes, so maybe featuring some great basics.  e.g. for a long time I could never remember how to hard boil an egg until I saw Sara Moulton's fool proof technique which never has that icky green line around the yolk.  Her technique is start in cold water, bring to boil, turn off heat, cover the pot and let it sit 15 minutes.

Kopali Organic Mix
CONTENT
I sampled this Kopali Organic Mix at Whole Foods the other day and got kind of hooked. I think of it is as an advanced trail mix. Goji Berries, Cacao Nibs, Mulberries, and Pistachios, each with distinct nutritional benefits on their own, are mixed together to form something delicious. The slightly tangy Goji Berries have long been used in Asia to help eyesight and boost immune function. The bitter of the Cacao Nibs is a nice balance, while getting loads of antioxidants. The mulberries are mild and naturally sweet, and provide iron, fiber, and Vitamin C. Last but not least, nutty and yummy pistachios are the \"more bang per calorie\" nut. The nice little packages make great transportable snacks or on-the-go breakfasts.By the way, their Chocolate Covered Cacao Nibs are delicious too!

Frozen Yogurt at Forty Carrots in Bloomingdale's

I finally got to try the frozen yogurt at Forty Carrots Forty Carrots today! Thanks to everyone who recommended it, and reminding me (I need that); I enjoyed it. First though, I have to say, the service is pretty frazzled. We went to the to-go counter because it's an $8 minimum per person to get sit-down service. I asked the counter clerk, what flavors does the frozen yogurt come in? He says, plain, strawberry, and coffee. I ask if I can have all three and we also order a lemonade. He disappears for long enough that roughly 4-5 people behind us got served and left. Then the frozen yogurt appears with plain, coffee, and chocolate. I didn't really care but apparently they had 4 flavors, which he forgot, and he forgot which flavors he told me. The yogurt was over-flowing and melting all over everyone. People constantly rushed back to the counter complaining that it was dripping everywhere so it would be nice if they got bigger cups.As for the frozen yogurt, the chocolate and coffee taste like soft-serve ice cream, no yogurt flavor at all, but enjoyable. The plain tastes like yogurt and has a wonderful rich mouth-feel that the other ones (like Pinkberry and Red mango) don't have. However, I don't recommend eating the plain with the other flavors. It doesn't go together well.Even though I enjoyed it and the nutrition facts seem favorable enough, I'm not addicted, as I think some people are. I'll have it if I'm around, but I'm not going to crave it and make a special trip there.

Doesn't sound like the best experience. Your ice cream truck sounded much better. Oh well, it was good of you to try, now I don't have to.

The strawberry tastes like strawberry quick, and gets cloying. I usually just get the plain and tell them not to fill it all the way cause they give you way too much. The chocolate is pretty yummy also.

You mentioned Flushing Mall the other day and the red bean dessert place. That triggered my memory about the awesome (to me) frozen yogurt they have there. They only have plain. And they've been serving that way before Pinkberry existed. But thanks for trying Forty Carrots and sharing your experience!

Jianetto's Pizza Truck
CONTENT
A group of us met for lunch by Xiu's office, at Jianetto's Pizza Truck, which I happily found on Midtown Lunch. As recommended, I called (917-287-7241) ahead to place my order, and to check the location (always one on 47th Street between Madison and Park, but sometimes one is on 51st Street between Park and Lex). The service is friendly and competent. I got my order quickly and easily.The experience ended there. The food was not memorable. We got a pie for $19 and the sauce was slightly acidic, both of which would not have been a problem had there been cheese. Averaging out at $2.37 per slice, that's expensive! I either want cheese or killer pizza dough and sauce, which it wasn't.The Sicilian Rice Ball was a better deal. A pile of ground meat, peas, deep fried rice, sauce, and cheese for $4.50, and it comes with 4 doughy garlic knots. I enjoyed this a little bit more than the pizza but not enough to remember it for more than 2 days.I'm kind of disappointed that this meal wasn't special, more disappointed then when a restaurant is mediocre. I unreasonably feel like food off a truck should be unique, outstanding, and worth calling my mom about. Boo hoo...

I am really surprised at your conclusion on the slices.  It sounds like you had some preconceived notions of what you wanted the pizza to taste like, and when they offer something different you freaked out.Try it again and taste it for what it is - simple ingredients, great texture, beautiful harmony in flavor.

Anonymous, I read the review on Midtown lunch so I knew that it would be without cheese. I didn't "want" it to taste specifically like anything, just hoping it would be really good.  I happen to love carbs and have been known to eat whole loves of bread plain. The case here, is that it just wasn't memorable for any of us (group of 4).

Lambsquarters
CONTENT
Lambsquarters is such a weird name for a wild green. I spotted it at the Farmer's Market this weekend and grabbed a bunch for $1. The sign said, \"use as you would spinach,\" so I did a simple saute with garlic and olive oil.I like how they retain shape better than most cooked greens. It looks very pretty, with a few touches of hot pink here and there. The stems are a bit tough and hard to chew. Still, lambsquarters are quite tasty and highly nutritious (more impressive than regular spinach), so just remove the stems and you're good to go.

Sake Sushi

I road my bike out to Queens yesterday to help Monica with some renovation decisions on her apartment. When it was time for lunch, we didn't know much about the restaurants in the area, so we just did a random pick and ended up at Sake Sushi Sake Sushi. This will be a short post since, it's nothing special, just your average cheap, local Japanese place.The lunch menu is cheap but not extraordinarily so and the quality is what you paid for. Actually, the salad was atrocious, even so. The iceberg and tomato seemed like it had been in a semi-frozen state from sitting in a very cold fridge. Otherwise, the $9.95 Udon was as expected and they offer a long list of rolls at $2.99 each, which were edible.

Tuna Sliders
CONTENT
A long time ago, Angie and I had lunch at Perry Street and the only memorable dish was a Blue Fin Tuna Burger. I've been wanting to recreate it, or at least a simplified version of it. It took me more than 8 months but it was worth the wait.Tuna Sliders~makes 5 appetizer sized burgersTuna BurgerWasabi Mayo1. Put tuna, egg, soy sauce, corn starch, and sesame oil in a food processor and pulse just a few times. It should be easy to form patties. Make five 3″ patties. Set aside2. In a small bowl, mix wasabi powder with water to form a paste. Mix in the mayonnaise, until even. Set aside.3. Lightly toast the bread rounds.4. Heat a non-stick pan with non-stick spray on medium-high heat. Place the tuna patties on the pan and sear each side for less than a minute. Set on a plate to rest for 5 minutes. A little liquid may come out.5. Form sliders by placing one bread round on the bottom, a tuna patty on top, then a dollop of wasabi (you won't use all of it), 3 slices of cucumber on each, then the top bread round.We both really enjoyed these Tuna Sliders and the only thing I would change is to marinate or pickle the cucumber slices next time, as an extra nice touch.Since we had tuna, Lon played around with it too. Unfortunately, getting him to write down a recipe is like pulling teeth. His dish was so awesome though: diced tuna tossed in a spicy mayo dressing, some seaweed mixed in, served with rice crackers. It'll be perfect for our next party!

Mmm... last night's dinner was tuna heaven!  Spicy tuna is one of my all time favorite sushi preparations, so I've practiced it.  I can't tell you the exact amounts of what I included but the basic recipe is: diced raw tuna (or the best is to pull scrapings of tuna off the bone), Sriracha (chili garlic sauce), a bit of sushi-rice vinegar, literally one drop of sesame oil (too much instantly kills the whole dish), cayenne pepper, and granulated garlic.  Toss it together and let it sit for at least 10 minutes, 30 minutes is preferable.You can garnish with sesame seeds if you like.  In this recipe I also added a type of seaweed and sesame snack from Japan, although I don't know what it's called.  And then served on top of Ka-Me Black Sesame and Soy Sauce Rice crisps.  It's the first time I've tried that flavor, but all the other flavors are awesome, so how could this one not be? They didn't disappoint.

Home Fried Potatoes and a Cousins' Brunch
CONTENT
My cousins came for brunch today and I asked Lon to make (and write the recipe) for Home Fried Potatoes. My only requirement was that I wanted him to use tomato paste. We agreed that it was a nice touch, adding both flavor and color to the dish. It turned out pretty spicy too but everyone loved it.Home Fried Potatoes ~about 6 servings (side dish)1. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add potatoes and boil for 10 minutes, strain, then air dry for 10 minutes. 2. Heat vegetable oil in a large cast iron pan, over medium-high heat. Stir in peppers and onions, season, and cook for 3 minutes, or until veggies are starting to soften. 3. Push peppers and onions to the side leaving a space in the middle of the pan. Add tomato paste and caramelize for about 30 seconds. Add cayenne and rosemary, stir until well combined. 4. Clear another space in the middle and add potatoes. Toss thoroughly, but avoid breaking potatoes too much. Cook 3 minutes. 5. Season to taste. You will likely have to add more salt as potatoes take a lot of salt. Keep warm in baking dish in oven at 350, uncovered, or serve immediately.We actually made double this recipe, which meant doing the whole thing in the cast iron twice, which fills a 9X13 pan nicely. My cousins are a hungry group so we made tons of other goodies. I made biscuits, partially whole wheat.

The home fries look good, but I like to get a little "fry" crust on my potatoes, danger with idaho potatoes is the startch means they stick if fried too long (or you have to drown them in oil).  What's the solution? Thx.
Lon
2008-08-04 08:58:00
Bill, Idahos are probably still the best bet, their high starch level means lots of sugar, which is what forms the crust.  It's the right variety, you just need the right technique...A few ideas to try:1. Cut the potatoes into smaller pieces, like 1/2″ cubes.2. Soak the potatoes in cold water for eight hours or over night.  Change the water at least once.  You can even add a bit of sugar and salt to the water (brine) to improve the crusty-creation.  This soaking will draw out some of the starch and soften the flesh a bit (which means less cooking is necessary).3. Deep fry the potatoes at 300-325 for 3-4 minutes, rather than boiling them in water.  This will start to develop the crust and give you a more enjoyable texture.  Per your note about oil, if done correctly, this should not make the potatoes oily, because the water content should keep the oil out.  Make sure to towel dry the potatoes before frying, and again after.4. When you start to pan fry the potatoes, make sure there is only one layer of potato, so they all get surface contact.  This helps in two ways. The direct contact will make that crust you're looking for.  And it avoids steaming the potatoes that are sitting on top of other potatoes.Hope those ideas help!
Jessica@Foodmayhem
2008-08-04 09:08:00
manger la ville, we didn't have much left-over.Bill, if you want to go low on oil, you may want to just try roasting waxy potatoes (like red, yukon, new, or blue). Toss them in a bit of olive oil and salt (optional: garlic and herbs) and roast at around 400 degrees. The outsides will get crispy.
KasiandStephen
2008-08-04 10:08:00
Jessica, just curious why did you want tomato paste in the potato?Bill - I always crust my home fries and only use Idaho potato.  Two ideas: one, used baked (or microwaved) potatoes that have cooled completely.  Two, add a little water to the pan and cover to allow the potatoes to steam through a bit, then get the crust afterwards.
Bill G
2008-08-04 10:43:00
Kasi, that's the problem for me, once the potatoes start steaming, they get mushy and break into pieces and  I'm left with dry mashed potatoes - which I can then put a crust on, but it's mushy and ugly.  I love home fries that retain their physical integrity but also have some nice fry.  I'll try Lon's recs and I'll try using boiled (ala Lon) and baked (ala you) to see which works out better.  Thanks for all the awesome feedback everyone!

Feasting at Flushing Mall Food Court
CONTENT
Most malls that I have been to have terrible food. They focus on bringing interesting stores and the food courts end up with just McDonald's, Wendy's, Nathan's, Pretzel Time, and Panda Express. Flushing Mall Flushing Mall, did it all backwards. Not many people visit the shady, retail stores, but their food court is always a mob scene, and for good reason: the food is good and cheap!We met up with my cousins at the food court, took charge of two connecting tables, and had one or two stand guard, while the rest of us split up to get food at all our favorite stands. We're very efficient!The Taiwanese plates hit the table first. Oyster Pancakes are hard to describe. They have juicy oysters, eggs, leafy greens, and a somewhat sticky and gooey starch that holds it all together. That may not sound appealing, but the combination, topped off with a sweet sauce is uniquely rewarding.We also got one stir-fried with shredded pork. No matter which preparation, the highlight is the thick and ultra chewy noodles.Still, people kept leaving the table and coming back with more! I come from a family of savages!The giant plate of boneless Fried Chicken scared me. I loved the hot crispy chunks anyway and the preserved radish was a big plus.

Kelsae Onion

I stumbled across Kelsae Onions at the Farmer's Market today. They are huge! I put it next to a large regular onion so you can see how big it is. The sign said something like, sweet and great for salads, so I was hoping it would be like the onions in Greece, edible in large pieces raw! Alas, the Kelsae onions still have a bite, giving a bit too much sting for thick salad rings. They are very sweet though and could be eaten raw if thinly sliced, and are fabulous sauteed.

Another wonderful evening at Sushi Yasuda, and still getting new pieces to try. Tonight, we had Black Drum Fish (the middle piece), which looks like fish, but has a texture much closer to clam. It had that very nice bounce I like, but there was also a strong tendon running through.Next, Rock Crab (left), which apparently was always on the menu but somehow we missed in the passed, was extremely fresh and tender. I think it made Lon's favorite's list. The Isaki (right) was just another white fish for us, but still superior to white fish at another restaurant.

Chocolate: Good or Evil
CONTENT
This post is not what you think it's about. It's not about how I love chocolate and hate the calories. It's about how my precious but mischievous Jack Russell Terrier scared me to death this morning when I woke up and found that she hard torn open the packaging, and eaten a chocolate chip cookie.As much as I love the taste of chocolate, the smell of chocolate, the versatility and pairings of chocolate, I would look at it with an evil eye for the rest of my life it it hurt my little princess. Most of us know that chocolate is not good for dogs, but I found this website that gives much more detailed information about the toxicity of chocolate to dogs. It's good to know, but still not a substitute for calling your vet, which we did. Poor Ice (my dog). We had to induce vomiting (with hydrogen peroxide) and she did puke it all up, thank goodness. Our Vet, Dr. Prattis, also checked her out and gave her the thumbs up.My lesson learned: Ice is nimble. Ice is quick. Ice can jump over more than a candlestick. She also uses her front paws like hands and has remarkably fine motor skills for a dog. Let this be a friendly reminder to keep anything chocolate, especially the good expensive chocolate all you fabulous bakers use, in extra safe places.

Oh no! Poor Ice. I hope she is better after this whole ordeal.I have in the past given my dog "toxic" foods such as grapes and fish poached with lemon slices, unbeknownst at the time that grapes/raisins and citrus fruits are bad for dogs.  (No problems though, thank goodness!)I am now constantly on the web and scour my canine cookbooks trying to figure out what I can or can't feed her. There are a lot of conflicting information out there, but at the end of the day, it is better safe than sorry.You can make it up to Ice with Carob Chip cookies! http://www.families-first.com/pets/carobcookies.htm

Thanks Ellen, I generally don't let Ice eat any human food since it's hard to know what she can/cannot eat, but she does grab anything she can on the floor outside, often so fast that I don't even see what it is.Thank you for your empathy Dr. Food...the heart attacks of doggie parents....I hope your pitbull learned his lesson and stays aways from the poison. =(

Lazy Sausage Meatballs with Eggplant
CONTENT
I'm still getting over the cold, or whatever I have, so I'm still doing lazy dishes. Thankfully, I had half a box of sausages in the fridge left-over, since it was a BJ's box of meat, exactly 1 pound 13 ounces, so that's what's in the recipe. Don't be alarmed by large amount of food this makes. It's the perfect thing to have left-over, easily re-heatable in the microwave, or easily packed as a lunch.Lazy Sausage Meatballs~roughly 10 servings1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (375 degrees F with convection).2. Make tomato sauce and just leave it simmering.3. Cover an 9X13 pan with aluminum foil and toss eggplant with olive oil in the pan. Season with salt and roast for 20 minutes or until soft. Just set aside when done.4. While the eggplant is roasting, mix sausage, bread crumbs, and egg together in a large bowl.5. Form 1 inch balls with all of the meat mixture.4. Heat a large pan and brown all sides of the meatballs without oil. The sausage meat should have enough oil to prevent sticking (but surprisingly, not much excess oil/liquid will come out). After browning the sides, the inside will not be cooked through.5. Throw the meatballs in the tomato sauce and cook on low heat for at least 30 minutes, and up to 45 minutes.6. When the meatballs are 15 minutes away from done, toss the eggplant into the sauce and stir. Cook on low heat for another 15 minutes.7. Serve with any pasta shape you want.I served Garlicky String Beans for veggie.

Chocolate Banana Ice Cream Sandwiches
CONTENT
I've never really been interested in plain chocolate cookies. I like chocolate chip, oatmeal, ones with nuts and cranberries, chocolate dipped butter cookies, the list goes on. So why would I make them? Because soft chocolate cookies are exactly what you need for a killer ice cream sandwich. You need them to be soft and easy to bite through so that the ice cream doesn't squeeze out. Plain chocolate works well with lots of other flavors, probably any ice cream flavor.I have to admit that when these were still warm, right out of the oven, they were delicious, very brownie like.Still, they are even better when cooled and used to make ice cream sandwiches. This one is made with the banana cookies 'n' cream ice cream. What a combo!

Sausage, Peppers, and Onions
CONTENT
I almost didn't write this post because making Sausage, Peppers, and Onions is so little work, I don't even consider it cooking. Then, it occurred to me that this could really benefit some busy moms out there. As I prepared this meal, while not feeling so well today, I reminisced about how my mom always managed to put a balanced meal on the table, even when she had a fever. (My dad was so clueless in the kitchen. He can barely use the microwave correctly.)Sausage, Peppers, and onions, was one of the few non-Chinese food dishes my mom made and I remember my brother begging for it sometimes. Yet, it's the easiest dish to prepare. Anyone can slice bell peppers and onions.

This reminds me of my childhood! We lived near one of the best (well, in my humble opinion) Italian American butchers in Chicago, and I used to habitually eat my weight in sausage. The sausages were fantastic-they had these huge fennel seeds in them that didn't overpower the meat

Inside the Despana Basket: Sweet Olive Oil Tortas
CONTENT
I've been staring at the Ines Rosales Sweet Olive Oil Tortas in our Despana Basket, thinking that they would probably just be a standard cracker-like bread. I'm feeling a little bit under the weather, and that's when I want crackers. When I opened the package up, the wrapping of each in wax paper made sense. It was oily, but only to your fingers, not in your mouth.Admittedly, I guess I didn't pay attention to the word \"sweet\" in the name, so it was a little shocking for me when I tried it. It was lightly sweetened, but more jarring was the strong anise flavor.

Yesterday, I spent the day at Carol's apartment, and she handed me some Glad Corn. It looks like large corn kernels that partially exploded, tastes like a cross between soy nuts and popcorn. I'm not sure if they should be legal. After one try, I'm totally addicted and I've been thinking about them and searching for stores that sell them (mostly health food stores). I know Carol got it at Fairway, but you can also order it on-line and get a free sample from their website.

Beef and Poblano Empanadas
CONTENT
I had exactly 1 pound and 7 ounces of ground beef left from Lon's birthday BBQ. It was just as good a time as any to practice making Empanadas, which Lon loves. I tried an empanada dough recipe from epicurious.com and made-up my own filling.Beef and Poblano EmpanadasMake Filling:1. Heat oil in a large pan (12″) on medium heat. Add onions and cook for 2 minutes.2. Add garlic and stir for another minute.3. Add tomato paste and allow to brown a little, approximately 2 minutes.4. Add poblanos and stir for another minute.5. Add ground beef and stir with a wooden spoon, trying to break up any clumps. Cook until there are no more pink spots, approximately 6-8 minutes.6. Add cumin, chili powder, tomato vinegar, dried cilantro, and salt. Stir.7. Simmer on low heat for 10 minutes. Most of the liquid should be evaporated by now. Turn off the heat and let it cool to room temperature.Making Empanadas:1. Put oven racks in upper and lower thirds of the oven. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (375 degrees F with convection).2. Divide the dough into 12 equal pieces. While the remaining dough remains covered, roll out one piece on a lightly floured surface. Shoot for a 5 inch round about 1/8 inch thick.3. Spoon two rounded tablespoons of filling onto the dough and fold in half. Press the edges securely together, decoratively if you wish. Transfer to un-greased baking sheet.4. Make the rest of the empanadas the same way and brush with egg wash.5. Bake for 25 minutes, rotating baking sheets in the middle. Cool for 5 minutes before serving.

Sunday Cherry Pancakes
CONTENT
This recipe is an adaptation from Kelly's Blueberry Pancake recipe on her site Eat Make Read. It is a fabulous idea, adding honey, cinnamon, and vanilla to pancake batter. When I read the post, I saved the page to use this weekend. I halved the recipe to suit two people and I used cherries because that's what I had on hand, now calling these Sunday Cherry Pancakes because pitting cherries one by one takes time. Pay close attention to step 4, which I added, because it makes a big difference with pancakes!1. Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, salt and cinnamon in a medium sized bowl.2. Combine milk, eggs, butter, honey, and vanilla in a separate small bowl.3. Add wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and fold until just combined. Allow for clumps.4. Let the batter sit for roughly 10 minutes. (You can pit the cherries at this time if you want. I did.) You will see bubbles forming in the batter. This is good!5. Heat a skillet with non-stick spray or butter (I tried both and both work well.) on medium heat. Pour batter, attempting to form circles, in any size you like. Add cherries on top of the batter. When you see the batter bubbling, flip it over. Let it heat through for another minute. Remove from skillet and repeat with remaining batter.6. Sprinkle with confectioner's sugar.They were indeed perfect, fluffy and lightly sweetened. It needs nothing else, even for a maple syrup lover like Lon. Thanks Kelly!

Birthday Revisit to Wildwood Barbecue
CONTENT
Do you remember our visit to Wildwood BBQ a few months ago? Well for Steve and my birthday today, a few of us went back again (after watching The Dark Knight, which was exceptional, albeit ridiculously long). Except for me and Jessica, it was everyone's first visit. The food got the same solid reviews as last time. The ribs are good, perhaps best most have had in NYC (although Steve noted that Dallas BBQ is a great deal at $10 -- although I think the service and environment are atrocious); the beef brisket is delicious; the appetizers are all a treat and most of the sides are pretty great.One change I was let down by was that the Creamed Spinach I loved so much last time are far more creamy and less spinach-y, oh well. Some things we hoped would changed did not. Like the mac 'n' cheese still had no flavor. And finally, some things got better! The desserts were less sweet and still huge. We really enjoyed all five we tasted. My personal favorite was the Carrot Cake. Generally, I can't stand carrot cake, but theirs was the best! A close second were the Peanut Butter S'mores.Afterwards, we were all stuffed, and had to be rolled out.

Maeda-en Matcha (Green Tea Powder)

Last week, I picked up some Maeda-en Matcha (Green Tea Powder) from M2M for $10, thinking this container would be full. Surprise, surprise, there was a little bag inside with roughly 3 tablespoons of powder. Granted, it smelled so good, I wanted to snort it and the color was magnetic (with any food coloring). But dang, it's expensive.I will likely try some cheaper options to compare. Stay tuned!

The same thing happened to me when I purchased matcha as JAS; tiny bag in an oversized tin. A few decent lattes later, it was gone. In hindsight, wish I tried baking with it.Then I purchased a whole pound of matcha for $40 at culinaryteas.com, which is strong and bitter. I like my green tea flavored ice cream not-too-smooth and bitter which the matcha from culinaryteas.com would be appropiate for.For baked goods and drinks, I prefer very smooth and slightly bitter. I never got ideal results from using this strong tea powder in baking and my lattes. But I still use it for the sake of not wasting it.I have always loved the quality of teas from mightyleaf.com so I will try their matcha when I order next.

My friend Angie, always reading up on the latest noteworthy openings in NYC, instant messaged me this week. She read about The Redhead The Redhead and had to go. Skimming through the publicity they've had, the food sounded interesting, but it was a bar. I think you can tell, Lon and I are not bar people. Yea, we're no fun.I was pleasantly surprised when we arrived at The Redhead. It was indeed a bar, but a much cleaner one, a decently lit one, not at all smelly, not at all noisy. It was filling up by the time we left, but the crowd was calm, mature, and clean looking.Starting off with the Bacon Peanut Crunch and the Chips & Dip, we were all pleased. Perfectly roasted nuts, with the aroma of bacon (Lon wished there were big chunks of bacon) and perfectly fried waffle chips with a fresh and chunky dip, showed off their concept well - gourmet bar food?

Grass Jelly
CONTENT
Grass Jelly is a popular dessert and/or drink with Asians, made from the leaves of Mesona Chinensis (in the mint family). The dark brown to black jello-like cubes are not the most attractive option to have, but Chinese people believe in its cooling powers. I used to hate it as a kid and remember my mom trying to force me to eat it in the summer to prevent nose bleeds and other hot weather ailments. It is a slightly bitter and almost medicinal flavor, but often prepared with a syrup or something sweet. I can't explain how I grew to enjoy it but it is indeed refreshing, perfect for a hot summer day.

Inside the Despana Basket: Egg Cream
CONTENT
Last night I was incredibly thirsty, so I started poking around the fridge and remembered the bottle of Fuensanta, a sparkling, natural mineral water that was Inside the Despana Basket.I removed the bottle cap, making rare use out of the bottle-cap opening feature of our Oxo can opener. After a few sips of the water, the extreme level of carbonation was a bit too much, even though the taste of the water was great (very clean).So back to the basket I went, this time stumbling upon the container of Cola Cao (on Wikipedia for those of you who aren't fluent in Spanish).After reading online about how difficult it is to dissolve the super chocolatey mix in some whole milk, I took a swig. It is delicious: sweet and rich, very similar to Ovaltine. So, what to do next?Make a Spanish Egg Cream! Oy!! I rapidly stirred in the Fuensanta, the chocolate(ish) milk foamed up to the top of the glass, and I had one of my favorite drinks. Jessica had never really tasted one before, and decided it wasn't for her. But it hit the spot for me. After chewing a few lactase pills, I enjoyed that egg cream slowly.

You may have noticed that we missed Sushi Yasuda last week. We tried to make reservations and it was too late. Our Chef Mitsuru was all boooked. We learned our lesson and made reservations for next week before leaving the restaurant today. I apologize for terrible pictures. I only brought the point-and-shoot because there was a thunderstorm forecast.We loved the Sanma (Saury), lightly pickled, reminding me just a bit of pickled Herring. The flesh of this fish is so unbelievably tender and juicy.Kochi, more flavorful than others in the whitefish family, was not our favorite because of a tendon running through.

Bacon Wrapped Asparagus
CONTENT
Bacon Wrapped Asparagus is a real quick and easy crowd pleaser. I've made it for several parties and it's always one of the hits. The key is to use thin asparagus. It will cook more evenly and 3 to 4 thin stalks looks better then 1 or 2 fat ones.After you break the asparagus at it's natural point, wash and dry. I use half a length of bacon for each asparagus bundle. (Here that means 1 slice of bacon makes 2 bundles, which for me is 8 thin stalks of asparagus.) You just wrap it around, allowing a bit of the bottom to show. Pull it tight, stretching the bacon a bit. This time I only had thick-cut bacon in my fridge but it's actually easier and better looking with regular bacon.

Yum. I make another version of this with prosciutto for parties- grill the asparagus, squeeze some fresh lemon and then wrap in prosciutto. Works well with a tiny handful baby arugula tossed with fresh lemon juice and goat cheese and wrapped in a slice of prosciutto.I do prefer bacon, in all its smoked and crispy goodness.

They have an awesome cheese selection, the best smoked fish counter, and knowledgeable staff in the second floor housewares section. I miss living nearby so much!!Last night, we went to Zabar's like a kid at the candy store, going ga-ga over everything. We had to exercise restraint and just get a couple of things we actually needed. Ok, so we don't actually need anymore stuff in our kitchen but let's say, relatively needed. With Manny's very insightful help, we left with our new kitchen toys.Lon wanted a meat cleaver. He loves being the butcher and I gladly give up that roll. With a meat clever, you want some good weight, but don't spend too much. This knife gets banged around and damaged easily. We got a Joyce Chen cleaver for $26.98 with a comfortable wooden handle.Yippee! New Toys!

Last night, we opened a jar of Mojo Verde Suave from our Despana Basket. Also known as Canary Sauce (originating in the Canary Islands), this combination of ingredients is impressive, being somewhat creamy without any dairy, only green pepper, olive oil, garlic, parsley, wine vinegar, cumin, pepper, and salt.Start by pounding out chicken thighs. Season with salt and pepper. Place a layer of Chistorra and Manchego across the center. Sprinkle with chopped parsley.

Inside the Despana Basket: Chistorra
CONTENT
I had assumed that Chistorra would be just like all the different shapes of Chorizo in our Despana basket. It looked similar except longer and narrower in shape, and I didn't pay attention to the name on the package till writing this post. It's funny because I was thinking how it was very much a chorizo but just a bit spicier and a bit smokier. I loved it and it seemed to go perfectly in our brunch. I just looked it up and it turns out Chistorra is a Chorizo breakfast sausage. Hooray!

Chocolate Zucchini Cake in a Time Crunch
CONTENT
We were heading to Sara's for dinner and the plan was to bring dessert, but we ended up really short on time. I searched for a quick cake recipe and saw this interesting recipe for a Chocolate Zucchini Cake. It wasn't the best cake ever but had several strong points: It's made with 3 cups of grated zucchini making it a bit healthier. It wasn't too sweet. The inside is really moist, reminiscent of cake mix chocolate cake, and it's an easy cake to transport. The sides/edges are a little bit chewy and the walnuts didn't fit in this recipe, but it was quick and super easy, so when you're in a bind, this is not a bad option. I didn't have enough time to let it cool in order to frost it, so I served it with Cookies and Cream Ice Cream instead and it worked well.Thanks Sara!

16 Handles - Ehh...
CONTENT
I was excited that 16 Handles was opening near us since I like the pay-by-weight concept for frozen yogurt. We first saw that at Yogurtland (wonder if it's still 39 cents per ounce there) and the advantage is being able to get a small amount if you want to and/or mix as many flavors/toppings you want for 46 cents per ounce at 16 Handles.I stopped in today, in sweltering hot weather, perfect for sampling frozen yogurts, and left a little less than satisfied. The Plain Yogurt flavor was powdery. Cookies and Cream and Cheesecake were very artificial tasting. Green Tea was heavily tea flavored but in an off-putting way. The Coffee was very watery. The banana was the only acceptable yogurt flavor to me and my favorite was mango, a non-dairy and therefore not frozen yogurt option (more like sorbet) so it doesn't count towards points here. You don't have to take my word for it though since you can sample every flavor for free before purchasing, but you won't see me there.

Jessie, Lon, and I arrived at Lan Japanese Restaurant Lan Japanese Restaurant first, all very hungry, so we had an appetizer while waiting for Olivia. None of us cared for the Home-made Prawn Dumplings. We didn't know they would have water chestnuts in them, and it so happens, all three of us hate water chestnuts. Aside, the shrimp were a bit over-cooked, the wrapper had dry spots, but luckily this was the only dish, we really didn't like.

16 Handles Open Tomorrow
CONTENT
I can't believe the frozen yogurt explosion in NY! Every time I turn around, there seems to be another one. As we pranced around the city tonight, showing my cousin around the East Village, or shall I say, eating our way though the East Village, we spotted another one, 16 Handles 16 Handles. It looks like it has a similar concept to Yogurtland, but I won't know till tomorrow, opening day. I'm hoping it will be just as cheap since this one is close to our apartment.

Are frozen yogurts the same as Gelattos?
Ellen
2008-07-18 12:58:00
Yes! Red Mango (http://www.redmangousa.com/) just opened a store in my neighborhood in Murray Hill. But they just have two flavors, regular and green tea (yuck). Theirs is a lot like 40 carrots at Bloomies- tart and creamy. My friends seems to all like the creaminess better. I prefer the lighter taste of Flurt.And you're right about your Pinkberry review. It made me feel thirsty afterwards too. I didn't realize it until you mentioned it.
Jessica@Foodmayhem
2008-07-18 13:44:00
Knife, Frozen Yogurt and Gelato are not the same. The new fad of frozen yogurts comes from Asia, focuses on low or no fat frozen yogurts, that is meant to taste tart like yogurt. Gelato, originating in Italy,  focuses on creaminess, and is way way better in my eyes, but definitely has more fat. I actually had a yogurt flavored gelato in Venice which was amazing!!Ellen, I still haven't made it over to 40 Carrots, thanks for the reminder!
The knife
2008-07-18 14:01:00
Thanks for clarifying. I first had a frozen yogurt (strawberry yogurt ice cream) at the Chatu Chak Weekend Market at Bangkok 2-3 yrs back (ur ref on the Asian origins makes sense then). I just loved it. The Gelato craze started a bit later in India. Gelato parlours here have some yogurt based flavours. I wonder whether those would qualify as frozen yogurts then

I too live in EV and have been waiting for 16 Handles to open. Sat night was kind of a zoo but I still managed to get out sooner than I thought (Ive waited longer with less people in front of me at Pinkberry).They charge by weight- 46 cents per ounce. This annoyed me at first because I am clueless as to how much an ounce weighs. However, after placing my decent sized cup filled with a familiar tasting Eurotart flavor and Pistachio  yogurt topped with strawberries, blueberries, mochi, and some crushed oreos (my weakness), I was delightfully surprised to hear the cashier tell me $4.33 cents!It was the same feeling as buying a cute pair of shoes Ive been dying to get and having the salesperson tell me that they're on sale.Thank you 16 Handles, you've given me a reason to walk past St Marks for my frozen yogurt fix.
Jessica@Foodmayhem

Hi Erin,It is farther from you but I think  Yogurtlandis better than 16 Handles, and only 39 cents per ounce.
Erin

Thanks Jessica, I just tried out Yogurtland today on Bleeker (my word there are so many ice cream and frozen yogurt places there now!). I had a mix of the plain tart, strawberry tart, cookies & cream and added crushed oreos and strawberries. Im going to have to disagree that its better. Although it was a little cheaper the quality of the yogurt doesn't compare (bit on the icy side). Im sticking with 16 Handles for now.
Jessica@Foodmayhem
2008-07-22 15:09:00
Erin, sorry your experience wasn't good....I don't remember it being icy ...of course it's possible that both are just inconsistent because I thought 16 Handles pretty much sucked, ranging from powdery consistency to artificial flavor.
Solomon
2008-07-24 10:07:00
Sorry you're not a fan Jessica. Maybe you'll like some of the other flavors we'll be bringing in rotation (36 flavors in our inventory). I can assure you we don't use any powder mix, which is more than I can say about most of the frozen yogurt shops in the city. One of our vendors is Frogurt which has been popularized by the Bloomingdale's crowd. Our yogurt comes in liquid form directly from the manufacturer which is why we can proudly call it yogurt (and its Kosher!).Erin- thanks for your support (say hi next time you're in)Can't make everyone happy but we're trying to offer something for everyone (sorbet for the lactose, no sugar for the diabetic,  nonfat for the dieter.)

This is one of my first dishes. I remember being so proud of myself the first time I made dinner for my family and my mom raved about these mushrooms. Through the years, I've really expanded my repertoire but this one is still my mom's favorite. Even more impressively, these are the first mushrooms Lon has ever admitted to liking. (He just started to eat mushrooms.) He even took the left-overs for lunch today.Balsamic Drenched Portobellos1. Wipe portobellos with a damp paper towel. Wiggle the stems out and discard. Lay them on a plate bottom side up.2. Mix together garlic, mustard, balsamic vinegar, and olive oil. Spoon onto the mushroom caps. Let it sit room temperature for 45 minutes. Preheat the grill.3. Season with salt and pepper and place on the grill. How long depends on how hot your grill is so watch for when they look and feel tender. They will start out looking like a cup, the sides being raised, and will flatten when they are done.4. Let it rest on a plate for 5 minutes before serving. Sprinkle with parsley.

Andrew, the Smoke Master
CONTENT
Lon's cousin Andrew asked for a smoker as his graduation present. What a smart guy! He's been practicing for weeks, many hours at a time, honing his smoking skills and was finally ready to show it off... and we were lucky enough to be called in as taste testers.Andrew's brisket was nicely smoked and the sauce he created was perfect. I had to eat just one more piece even though I was bursting from the seems. He has perfectly mastered creating the pink ring that indicates a perfectly smoked piece of barbecue. And his sauce is well balanced with onions and tang. The left-overs we smuggled home made great sandwiches the next day.Of course, Aunt Heather wasn't going to let us come without a feast! She tried a new dish of Blistered New Potatoes with cipollini onions, Garlicky Shrimp Kebabs, and a great salad. Afterwards we found room in our already stuffed bellies for Blueberry Crumble and Stern-Family specials: the Poppy Seed Cookies.Lon would go nuts if I didn't give a special mention to the Stuffed Zucchini that Aunt Heather created, reminiscent of Clams Oreganata, without the oiliness and with extra nutrients. I lost count of how many he ate. Then he took 1.5 home.

Making this pie made me feel ultra feminine so I decided to call it Girlie Pie. There's something about peaches and strawberries; they belong with pink bows and ponies. (Maybe it's just me.) The first time I made this pie, the flavor was great but I felt like it needed a lot more filling so this time, I doubled it, and it was wonderful. My brother claims, it's the best pie he's ever had. Just don't tell him what I named it.*This pic is taken before baking, before putting the top crust on. Unfortunately, the other pics didn't come out so well.Girlie Pie1 recipe double pie crust ( I used this recipe but use your favorite if you have one.)Preheat the oven to 400 dergees F (375 degrees F if using convection)1. Toss the peaches and strawberries with white sugar and brown sugar and let it rest for 15 minutes. You can roll out pie crust at this time.2. Drain (save the liquid/syrup, I use it for pancaked and waffles) and toss with flour, cornstarch, and cinnamon.3. Spoon into bottom crust. Dot with butter and place top crust on, securing edges.4. Cut vents in the crust and sprinkle with turbanado.5. Bake for 45 minutes.

Gala Manor Gala Manor is a pretty large restaurant and yet I had never noticed it before somehow. Generally the dim sum wasn't that memorable but I have two little notes to give.1. There was one unique dish, a chicken and watercress filled Shu Mai, which was pretty good. I love that all these dim sum places are now trying to get inventive.Nothing was bad, but nothing was memorable. My top choices in Flushing are still Dong Yi Feng and Jade Asian Restaurant.

Big Bev' Biz a Brewin'
CONTENT
We're not big drinkers, but we follow all things food. And, dang if this is not big news. The 14.5 billion dollar a year, Belgian brewer InBev has acquired Anheuser-Busch! Here's the press-release (in PDF).InBev already produces the top selling beers in the world (made up of over 200 brands), including Becks, Cass, Jupiler, Labatt Blue, Sedrin, Siberian Crown, Skol, and Stella Artois. If you don't recognize some of those names, it just means you don't know your global beers, as each of those is a #1 seller in their markets. With the new acquisition, which moves the former American brand abroad, InBev will now also produce the Budweiser, Busch, and Michelob family of beers (amongst many others).I imagine many beer purests are mourning this day.

Living near the Idaho state border has allowed for an interesting peek into diehard Bud fans' brains. I saw a sign on an American flag-draped pickup truck that read "KEEP BUD AMERICAN" and right next to it a bumper sticker that said "REPEAL NAFTA." I knew I should have taken a picture!

Blend Your Own Cereal
CONTENT
Lon likes the cereals with dried fruits and nuts in them but have you noticed how expensive these are? On top of that, there usually isn't enough \"stuff\" in it, more just the cheap filler. We recently started blending our own cereals. This gives you complete control over which dried fruits are used, which nuts (and how they are cut), and which flake or filler.Our most recent mix had Special K as the base.The mix-ins were craisins, sunflower seeds, whole almonds, and a mix that had roasted soybeans, chopped dried apricots, dried blueberries, dried cranberries, walnuts, and raisins.

Glad to see my family is not alone in the art of cereal blending.  We do this too but in a slightly different way.  I make my own granola with lots of yummy dried fruit and candied ginger.  I use this as my base.  Then comes fresh berries or bananas. Then shreddies and then some Kashi.  Stir it up and you got cereal nirvana.

I mix my own too! I use Kashi Flakes or Good Friends or Quaker Oatmeal Squares as my base and I like to mix it with something sweeter and not so good for me like Cocoa Pebbles or Waffle Crisps. However, I'm not a fan of too much dried fruit or nuts in my cereal, or fresh fruit for that matter. I keep my cereals separate and mix each serving as I eat them, depending on my mood and what I have available.BTW, I use the Oxo Pop containers too!

Yuka
CONTENT
We've been hearing about Yuka Yuka lately, people raving about the amazingly cheap and fresh sushi, legends about the long lines. We had to see for ourselves, but chose to go for an early dinner at 6PM on a Sunday to avoid too much of a wait (about 5 minutes).The All-You-Can-Eat at $18.95, which Lon ordered, is not the way to go here. You'll just end up eating lots and lots of rice, not very good rice at that. Two of Lon's nigiri pieces had fish the size of my thumbnail (I have small hands by the way). Lon asked the waitress if the fish was always like this, hoping this was a mistake, and she smiled and said yes.Aside from the AYCE scam, it can be a very good bargain. My Sashimi regular was only $12.50, the fish were very fresh, and I was reasonably full. Therefore, I can understand the popularity of this place, but in the end, it's not for me and Lon. Beyond the freshness of the fish, we really want it to be cut correctly. At the very least, that means not chewing on tendons, at the extreme, it transforms the feel of the fish in your mouth. Here, it's just fat slabs. Next, I'm not at all interested in very lean tuna, which this plate was full of. Different parts of the fish are not created equal. Then to be more nit-picky, the shredded daikon was old and fibrous, again the rice is below mediocre, the tea here is watered down.We ended the meal with Deep Fried Ice Cream, which only comes in green tea. It was standard. Do I still think you'll get your money's worth? Aside from the AYCE, absolutely. It's super cheap! Whether you should go just depends on how picky you are.

Bar Stuzzichini
CONTENT
To celebrate a visit from our West Coast Sales Manager, Rob, some folks from the Linkstorm team headed over to Bar Stuzzichini Bar Stuzzichini last week, after work.At first we were told there were no seats, but our salesy sales guys work their magic and we got a great table, one of the few, out front. We sat outside on Broadway overlooking the passerbys. Wax, Lois, Rob, Tim, Melinda and I sat down, leaving space for Shruti and David to join us when they meandered over. As we waited we enjoyed some pretty good olive oil and bread, with a bit of pepperoncini and coarse salt.Wax invited Maria, our wonderful waitress to select which of the five items from the Dal Bar should be included in our Stuzzichini Misti, a choice of five meze plates to share for us (a reasonable deal at $11 per person). She chose very well!Shortly after ordering our wine arrived and then the Prosciutto di Parma, a healthy portion of 18-month aged meat, which we all enjoyed atop the bread.Along with the ham came a large plate of broken Pecorino Grand Cru. This was a wonderful pecorino, with a strong, buttery and nutty flavor. The pieces were quite large, which allowed us to enjoy the taste. But because of the salt level it took us a while to finish the plate.We took no time in finishing the plate of Arancini, fried rice balls with lots of cheese in side. Even though I'm not a big fan of rice balls, I agreed with Wax and others that this was a winner! We really enjoyed them.Two minutes later, two more dishes arrived, including the Polpette: fried meatballs. The flavor of these meatballs was perfect, but the oil level was not. As we cut into the meatballs oil literally pooled up on top and ran down the side.The last dish of our meze course was the Polpo, grilled octopus. It was a generous piece that tasted as fresh as any I had while in the Mediterranean, and definitely better than what we had in Katakalon, Greece.After about an hour of slowly eating and chatting, we placed our orders for mains; some of us chose pastas (primis) and others meats (secondis), which fit our levels of appetite after the big appetizer course. I warned everyone that I'd be shoving my fork into their plate, so feel free to order extra.Some of the dishes were gorgeous, such as Carciofi, golden fried artichoke hearts, which are actually a meze, but Shruti ordered as a side dish. They were tasty but greasy.Possibly the ugliest dish on the table was Wax's order of the Tagliolini con Pistacchio e Limone. It looked a bit like vomit. However, it was hands down the most wonderful tasting dish on the table. I couldn't stop stealing bites. The rich cream sauce was offset by the acid of the lemon. The pistacchio (which I actually don't care for) rounded the flavor by adding a certain flare which seemed to lock in with the nuttyness of the cheese. The pasta was also perfectly cooked.My dish was less interesting. It was nothing special to look at and offered nothing special in way of taste. The sausage was way overcooked and the broccoli rabe had little flavor. And unfortunately the pasta was a bit overcooked as well. Oh well.It could have been worse... Shruti's order of the Orecchiette e Cavolifiore (breadcrumbs and cauliflower over orecchiette) was incredibly oily! She couldn't eat it, and I only had a few bites because of it. I believe it was Melinda who had the Gnocchi all' Amatriciana. It looked pretty, but the gnocchi were horribly gummy and I'll be damned if I could find a bit of guanciale in the amatriciana sauce. Sad, I love that sauce. Melinda said she enjoyed it though.We also had a side dish of 'Ncapriata, sauteed chicory and fava bean puree. It was terrible, neither Wax or I finished the bit we took.After all the mains we opted to share two desserts from the Dolci menu for the eight of us, and it was more than enough. Unfortunately I forgot to take pictures. The Torta Caprese, a chocolate hazelnut cake was rich and wonderful, especially with the bit of ice cream on the side. The zeppole we had were extraordinarily rich and perfectly cooked.Overall we enjoyed ourselves at Bar Stuzzichini. They didn't rush us and our waitress was wonderful, perhaps because both her and Wax were from the midwest and loved Broadway shows? And the prices were very fair considering the expensive location. However, the food was generally way to oily, from the meatballs to the pasta to the fried dessert. And most of the pastas were not cooked correctly, an act of sacrilege for any Italian restaurant. The tagliorini was sensational and a distinctive treat. If I go back, that will be my choice.

Asian Pear Beet Salad (with or without Feta)
CONTENT
My friend Sheryl loves beets so I prepared some last time she came over. In a daring mood, I tried a pairing I had never seen or heard of before, beets with Asian pear. Hooray, it was a fabulous discovery and will forever be in my repertoire. I worked on a recipe and came up with a unique, refreshing, and eye-catching salad.In this recipe, I microwave beets, which I had no idea I could do until seeing it in \"Vegetables\" by James Peterson. It's a huge time saver!Asian Pear Beet SaladDressingSalad1. Microwave the beet in a covered microwave safe container for 2 minutes. Let stand, still covered for 2 minutes. Turn over and microwave again for 2 minutes. Let stand again for 10 minutes. It is ready if it is easily pierced with a pairing knife. Peel as soon as it is cool enough for your fingers.2. Chop beets and Asian pears into equal sized cubes.3. Whisk together dressing ingredients. Toss beets and pears with dressing. Mix in basil and refrigerate until serving.4. Crumble feta on top right before serving. If you don't like feta, don't use it. It'll still be good and pretty.

Sushi Yasuda #15
CONTENT
We didn't get to go to Sushi Yasuda last week since we were busy with weddings and they were closed July 4th-6th so by this week I was missing my sushi meals. The familiar pieces were glorious as always and they still had new pieces to offer.We've had Kuchiko several times before but always the red one, which we learned last night, is the female. This time, I got to try the male, which is white. The flavor is very much the same, but it seems to be slimmer so I prefer the female. (Sorry for the blurry pic. Didn't bring the SLR.)Jack Mackerel has the familiar flavor of mackerel, a bit toned down, and the flesh is more slippery.On our last visit, Lon saw another patron having the green tea mochi ice cream so he wanted to try it this time. It's one of the best I've had. It's not too sweet, the mochi is chewy but delicate, and the unsweetened powder on top just blows it away for me. I imagine that serving it at just the right temperature is important too. It's also a steal at $2 (with any sushi combo meal).

Basil-Lime Sorbet Turned Cocktail
CONTENT
Again, driven by the excess of an ingredient, I made Basil Lime Sorbet. Whenever I buy basil, I get way more than I need, but I hate wasting the beautiful and aromatic herbs. I found this recipe and it seemed like fate. I had an abundance of limes too.Basil Lime Sorbet~adapted from Mark Logan's recipe1. Place sugar and 3/4 cup of water in a small sauce pot. Bring to a boil and allow to boil for 1 minute, making a simple syrup.2. Pour the simple syrup in a blender. Add the honey, lime juice, and fresh basil. Puree.3. Pour into a freezer safe container and freeze, stirring every couple of hours, whenever you think of it. It will take about a day to be solid enough.My main alteration from the original recipe was using honey. I felt that the honey was an important flavor but overall, it was a bit sweet too sweet for me. As I was enjoying the refreshing basil, the perfect use for this recipe dawned on me - cocktails! Make a batch and keep it in your freezer. When your friends come over, just scoop some in a glass and add vodka or gin. It'll taste like a basil mojito.I still have some more so who's coming over?

Inside the Despana Basket: Chorizo and Taco Fun

Our Despana basket included several packages of chorizo. You've seen the little ones. Tonight, we had the fat ones, the size of bratwurst. I think all the different shapes and sizes probably taste the same, just made for different uses, all yummy.I used these fatties in a rice and beans dish, used as a side to my fun taco-themed evening with my cousins.I thought it would be really fun to have make-your-own bite sized tacos. I used Tostitos Scoops, chopped some chillies, chopped Monterey and Colby Jack cheeses, made pico de gallo and taco meat.

Mangia
CONTENT
I met Lon for a quick lunch by his office yesterday and it really had to be quick, so we opted for Mangia Mangia, just a fancier version of the common NYC lunch deli. They've got the sandwich station, salad station, pizza station, food by the pound, and bakery goods.We each assembled a plate to be weighed, a skimpy portion for each. Lon is trying to lose some weight and I couldn't get comfortable with the price at $9.95 per pound. I figured I could eat more when I got home. I really wish I had a picture (which I don't because I forgot the memory card in my camera, Doh!) to show you how just how little food cost over $18 (with a bottle of water).I guess the natural question is, is it really really good? No. The quality ingredients are similar to the Whole Foods weighed food section but the execution ranges from equal to Whole Foods, which is pretty good stuff, to terrible. Most heart breaking was the salmon, glazed with a decent teriyaki-like sauce, but so beyond over-cooked, I imagine it was drawing moisture from my tongue and killing me. Lon also had a piece of polenta that was really intended to be a salt-lick for horses. I enjoyed the white bean salad, orecchiette salad, and a piece of beef that I fished for (to choose a rare piece), but none seemed worth $9.95 per pound. Whole Foods is $7 ish a pound right? The last straw for me was the cheapy bendy plastic utensils. When you're charging that much, use silverware, or at least stronger plastic.I won't be going back.

Lamarca Lamarca is my friend Hilary's favorite restaurant. She wanted us, her running buddies, to try the place she goes to for her carb-loading dinners. Aside from a couple of eccentricities, Lamarca has a certain charm. The tip cannot be paid on credit card. They're not open on the weekends and on working days, the restaurant closes at 10PM. The decor is simply unnoticeable, yet still feels clean, and thank goodness for restaurants with enough light so you can actually see your food.They have a simple formula here. Most of the menu is pasta, in two price groups, $15.50 and $17. (Some of the $17 dishes are only available on certain days.) That comes with a perfect roll, hard and crusty on the outside, dense and chewy on the inside, and a nice salad. The dressing is unique, almost like a chunky chimichurri.I ordered the Chitarrucci con Salsa Aurora, recommended on a few on-line reviews. I really enjoyed the fresh square-cut linguine, my first experience of this shape. The sauce was similar to a vodka sauce but topped with smoked mozzarella. The combination worked well together but there was only enough smoked mozzarella for 2-3 bites and the sauce was sweeter than my preference.Hilary had the Gemelli alla Ciociara, one of my favorite pasta shapes, in a simple sauce of olives, onions, and peppers.I rarely make repeat visits since I always prefer to try new restaurants (and my list is really long), but if Hilary wanted me to go with her, I'd gladly go again.

i feel like the rolls were better when i first went. they are even bigger now and doughy-er. which is not a huge problem as i would normally eat it all but since you get the bread, salad, and pasta, if i ate the entire piece of bread, i can't finish the pasta! i usually go with andy so next time i think i'll just ask them to bring one roll so we don't waste food. he had the capellini with meatballs and tomato sauce, that was really tasty too! good meatballs, the sauce was on the sweet side but the pasta was cooked well.

well, it's still less waste then when restaurants give you a whole bread basket...I didn't initially eat all the bread but my pasta was over-sauced so it came in handy later.

Banana Crumb Muffins with Cranberries
CONTENT
I decided to make banana muffins for the same reason as most, because I had extra bananas that now had brown spots on them. (I actually like eating bananas slightly under-ripe when eating them raw.) My first thoughts were banana blueberry muffins. Doesn't that sound good? Yes, but there had been a forecast of thunderstorms coming and I was afraid to go out. I am very afraid of rain, as if the wicked witch of the West, I apparently think I'm going to perish every time it more than drizzles.Enough about me, the muffins became an experiment on Banana Crumb Muffins with Cranberries instead, which turned out to be a real keeper!! These are the most delicate of muffins, and taste so grandmother-made (ok, I don't even have kids yet). These could never be mistaken for store bought treats and will definitely send the message of love when you give them out.Banana Crumb Muffins with Cranberriescrumb toppingPreheat oven to 375 degrees F (350 degrees F if using convection). Line pan with muffin papers.1. Mix together AP flour, whole wheat flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt. Set aside.2. Beat together bananas, sugar, egg, and canola oil. Stir the wet mixture into flour mixture just until moistened.3. Fold dried cranberries into batter. Do not over mix. Spoon into each muffin cup.4. In a small bowl, combine brown sugar, 2 tablespoons of AP flour, and cinnamon. Cut in cold butter until it resembles coarse sand. Sprinkle over the muffins.5. Bake for 18-20 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out clean.6. Let it cool in the pan for 10 minutes before removing. Then put them on a wire rack and continue to cool.

Olive Oil: Ta Mylelia
CONTENT
Here's one of the bottles of olive oil we bought at Mandarini (gourmet food shop) in Mykonos: Ta Mylelia. I regret not buying more since it's a beautiful bottle and would make a great gift, but we had no way of knowing which ones would be good.We like this one very much, so we're 2 out of 3 so far. The flavor is quite unique, tasting more like olives than any other olive oil I've ever tasted. The viscosity is perfect and watching it pour and pool on the dish is very sensual.I've gone through a bit too much bread in the last few days because of this olive oil, but the good news is, it is available on-line (although way more expensive). I do recommend buying it!

As Jessica noted, you can find this oil at Demeter's Pantry (http://www.demeterspantry.com).Although it's more expensive than Jessica paid in Greece, if you include the price of air fare and hotel, you'll find that $22.00 is not so much for an outstanding olive oil.Plus, we're offering it on discount at the moment, so for the time being it's only $19.50.Andrew

Lollyphile Maple-Bacon Lollipops
CONTENT
As a sort-of joke gift, Kasi and Stephen got me some maple-bacon lollipops from Lollyphile. As a concept I totally approve of this type of gift. First, it's food. Second, it's got bacon. Third, it's something I haven't seen or tasted before!Darren, Nikola and most of the other folks at the dim sum table (where the gift was given) were pretty impressed at the unique gift. Now, several weeks later, I cracked into the box and started licking away.Interesting? Maybe. Unique? Definitely. Good? Um, no. Can you tell from the image above that there are little bits of bacon in the lollipop? Well as the subtle, maple-flavored candy melts away (unusually quickly, actually), the tips of those bacon bits begin to say \"hello\" to your tongue by scraping at it. It's a bit like licking a tongue scraper over and over.So, while I do love maple bacon, it just doesn't go over as a lollipop. I'd say this makes a good gag gift, as they're not horribly disgusting; but, for my bacon-based confections, I'll stick to the white chocolate pork rinds at Compass.

Chimichurri Flank Steak

Chimichurri is one of my favorite flavors. I have made it with different types of vinegars and gone back and forth between cilantro and parsley, but all versions come out wonderful. If you have extra sauce left-over, save-it. It goes well on chicken, fish, almost anything. I wrote down the recipe we used for our July 4th barbecue yesterday. Hope you had a fun and yummy one!Chimichurri Flank SteakMarinade and Sauce1. Put all the marinade/sauce ingredients in a blender or food processor and pulse for about 10 seconds.2. Reserve 1 cup to use as sauce later.3. Use the rest to marinate the flank steak (which we cut in half to fit our containers). Refrigerate for at least 5 hours.4. Grill the flank steak for about 7 minutes on each side (with a 90 degree rotation if you want grill marks) to get medium rare. This will vary by grill.5. Slice 1/2″ slices against the grain and serve with reserved Chimichurri sauce.Try my Asian Style Chimichurri Steak too!

Hua Rong

At least once a month, I go to Queens to stock up on food. We usually hit BJ's or Costco, and a Chinese supermarket. On top of saving loads of money, it also means I get to have lunch with my mom. She's always got ideas for where to take me and Queens is where Chinese food is at these days.Yesterday, my mom took me to Hua Rong Hua Rong, a Foochow style restaurant, to try all these dishes I've never had. We started with two traditional breakfast items: the House Special Ho Fun with clam and Fried Oyster Cake. The ho fun (gua bien) here is not your standard noodle. \"Gua\" means pot and \"bien\" means rim and these noodles are made by skimming the top layer off over and over to get sheets of noodles. The soup is a nice clear broth.The meal was enjoyable, but more because it was all new and interesting, none if it was exceptional. Nothing was bad though either and I'd be happy to try Foochow food again.

Steve & Yael's Rehearsal Dinner at Friedman's
CONTENT
Steve, Lon's best friend, is getting married tonight. The rehearsal dinner was held last night at Friedman's Delicatessen Friedman's Delicatessen. I absolutely loved the idea. Rehearsal dinners are predominately for out-of-town guests and what better way to greet out-of-towners than with a real NYC-style meal: kosher-style deli!Lon enjoyed the potato latkes, although neither of us loved them, because they weren't really traditional latkes. They were deep fried, which can do no wrong, but they were more like fritters than latkes.I don't like hot dogs, but these were pretty good! Of course the fatty flaky pastry surrounding it helped. Lon polished off a bit too many.The matzoh ball soup was prettier than most, a really smooth and big ball, but it didn't have much flavor.The Kasha Varnishke was the favorite for both of us, a carb-lovers delight! The bow ties were al dente, with a good proportion of kasha stuck to each piece and onions lightly sweetened the deal.The dish of mushroom barley was forgettable.These fries were fatter than I like, but managed to be crispier than most this thick-cut fries. Since they were hand-cut, there were a few miscellaneous thinner pieces and I did hunt for those.Each person was given three half-sandwiches: pastrami, corned beef, and turkey breast. I don't ever like corned beef or turkey cold cuts so I only ate the pastrami, which fit my imagination of a perfect Jewish deli sandwich. We were so full by the time sandwiches came so I'm glad I only wanted to eat one of them, again Lon finished off quite a few.These rugelach were interesting. Most have a jam or chocolate paste rolled into the dough, but these seemed to have a brownie-like texture for the chocolate part.

Inside the Despana Basket: Paella de Mariscos
CONTENT
Most foodies would never go near boxed paella, but for the good of the world, I went in fast and furious. It was a box of Marinesca's Paella de Mariscos (Seafood Paella), included in The Despana Basket.Because Jessica is allergic to artificial coloring and this product had artificial yellow in it, I waited for a night when Jessica wasn't going to be home. The other night she went out with friends, so out came the box o' paella. The concept of seafood in a box is scary, but when I opened the package, I was pleased to find that at least the seafood was in a can, inside the box and later discovered it was cured seafood. Also in the box was a small bag of short grain, white rice.The instructions were incredibly simple: pour the contents of the can into a frying pan, fill the can with water and bring to a boil. Add the rice and simmer for 18-22 minutes or until the water is absorbed. Anyone could make this!Worried about the taste, I also rendered some chorizo in a separate pan, added garlic, and chopped up chicken thighs with paprika. Later I plated that along side the paella.Basically this tasted better than I expected a box of paella would... but still tasted bad. The rice was good, albeit a bit oily, and the taste of saffron was barely there (probably why they added artificial color), and the seafood was absolutely gross. I was so happy to have made the extra chorizo and chicken, to chase the flavor of the seafood.If you really wanted to, there are various places you could buy this product online (in addition to Despaña, such as Exportacion Gallega and Telemarket.fr). But I recommend you don't. Rather, just make yourself some paella, it's pretty easy, just follow my paella recipe.

Last night, we sampled quite a few items from our Despana basket. With some bread and olive oil, nibbling on meats and cheese is my idea of a fun evening. The Campofrio Chorizo Espanol was amazing. You could really taste and smell the smoky paprika in the perfect balance of not too salty and not too sweet. The texture was like a fabulous soft salami, chewy but easy to bite through. I ate some pieces alone and some between bread, loving both methods.

Spicy Baba Ganouj
CONTENT
I decided to make Baba Ganouj today and a light bulb went off - I should add harissa (that I bought at SOS Chefs) to it. It just made sense in my head so I was hoping the result would be as good. For me, the harissa was a hit! It brought out a smokiness and added a tang, and of course some heat. Unfortunately, Lon didn't like it. We do occasionally differ on taste. Oh well.I think it's important to note that the tahini I used, is the one we brought back from Greece. It is earthier and has more roasted flavor than the tahini's I've bought here. You may need to use more tahini to get as much flavor.Spicy Baba Ganouj1 1/4 pound eggplant2 tablespoons and 1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice2 cloves garlic, roughly chopped3 tablespoons tahini1/4 teaspoon cumin2 teaspoons Harissa1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.2. Pierce eggplant with fork in several spots and place directly in oven. Place something beneath to catch drippings. Bake until soft, roughly 40 minutes.3. Peel the eggplant and discard the skin.4. Place eggplant, lemon juice, garlic, tahini, cumin, and harissa in a food processor. Process until smooth.5. Let it cool to room temperature before serving. Keeps in refrigerator for a few days.

Taiwanese Sun Pastries - Tai Yang Bing
CONTENT
My cousin Olivia brought some Tai Yang Bing (Taiwanese Sun Pastry) back from Houston. Oddly, I had never tried these before, probably because my parents aren't into sweet stuff and I fear things that are in the same family as moon cakes. The sun pastries are pretty good. The layered pastry (made with lard) is flakier towards the outside, doughier towards the inside, and filled with some kind of gooey honey paste. I enjoyed it, especially because it wasn't too sweet, but I won't be seeking it out. I would eat it again though if it appeared in front of me.

Dr. Food, they didn't really remind me of baklava when eating them, probably because they are not that sweet and less wet. Can't wait to see pics of your baklava!Asianmommy, I'm Taiwanese too!

Hi Wonders, they do look pretty similar. Just to clarify for others, Old wife pastries have a sweet winter melon filling as opposed to the honey filling of the sun pastries.

I got these from a bakery in Houston called Mei Xin. They also make Lao Po Bing but my family loves the Taiyang Bing so we stick with that. I think we didn't grow up eating these because our parents are from Taipei and these are a specialty of Taizhong.

Hunan Tea Garden
CONTENT
My mom has been wanting to take us to her friend's sister's restaurant, Hunan Tea Garden Hunan Tea Garden, for a while now, but it's in New Jersey and we rarely get out there. To be more efficient, we planned a day of tax-saving shopping (poor Lon) to work up an appetite for the massive meal to come. My mom had pre-ordered all her favorites, several in double portions, and then some complimentary dishes were added, culminating in one of the largest meals Lon and I have ever eaten!We started with complimentary bowls of Hot & Sour Soup, more sour and more peppery than standard, but not better or worse than standard.Shortly after our soups were done, two giant platters of Ginger and Scallion Sauteed Crabs arrived. We only had 7 people, less then the standard 10 at a banquet table so I don't know why my mom ordered two platters, but we cleared those dishes! The crabs were perfectly cooked and hard to resist.Eye-catching Salt & Pepper Jumbo Shrimp arrived with tasty heads. Yes, we eat the heads. Lon thinks these were the best shrimp he's had in the U.S.My mom was so excited to share the Scallop dish with us; she had tried it on her last visit. It was indeed unique, something like a General Tso's Scallop. Why hadn't anyone else thought of this before? The execution was excellent: very crunchy coating, tender scallop, not too sweet, and served piping hot. Yum Yum (or as Justin and Lon kept saying \"nom nom nom\")! Good thing my mom ordered two servings of this one too.Two different platters of soft shell crabs arrived. I didn't care much for the onion and scallion version that was served over thinly sliced tomatoes.I did enjoy the version with black bean sauce over thinly sliced oranges, but my brother and I agreed that we prefer the simple preparations of soft shell crab, where the natural flavor shines through. Extra flavors mask the crab a bit; at least these were very meaty soft shell crabs.The Beef and Peppers dish with bean curd was pretty standard. I was so full already that I only took a few bites, knowing more was coming.Honey Ham with Lotus Seeds is a very sweet dish, but for some reason, I like it.Alas, surprise! There was one more complimentary dish!! A Carp in Tomato Sauce:a mild version of sweet and sour. The flesh was tender and the sauce was perfect. It was a little sweet, a little tangy, and very garlicky.

Grand Harmony
CONTENT
I am pretty much against eating dim sum in Chinatown/Manhattan these days but it was the convenient thing to do for 7 people on our way to New Jersey. We tried Grand Harmony Grand Harmony and the short version of it is, it's not very good. We forgot the camera in the car but nothing looked that appealing anyway. Several plates were cold or room temperature. The fish balls (according to Lon and my mom cause I don't like them) were more starch than fish. The shrimp wrapped in rice noodles had good chewy dough but the shrimp were pretty small. The duck feet were acceptable. There was some dumpling we got with very hard, dry skin. The beef ribs were clumpy and fatty (much more than the usual), pretty gross. None of us were too satisfied so we headed to a bakery for some bread in case people got hungry in the car.For dim sum, stick to Flushing/Queens.

Nirvana Cafe
CONTENT
Yesterday was one of those uncomfortably humid days. My clothing was getting stuck to me as I walked with Xiu to Nirvana Cafe Nirvana Cafe, where we met with Sarah, for a fun dinner of Sri Lankan cuisine.Inside, the air conditioning was on so low, it was barely noticeable. I was sticking to the chair and trying to fan myself for most of dinner until the AC was turned up towards the very end. I really liked our waiter though, who was welcoming, almost as if he was inviting us into his home, and helped us pick out our menu.Similar to Indian restaurants, a plate of Pappadum was offered. It wasn't crisp though, soft and bendable, possibly from the insane humidity.Our first dish arrived and we were all excited to see that Lamprais reminded us of our Zongzi.We chose the Lamb Lamprais and it was oily but still the favorite for all three of us. The rice was mixed with fried green plantains, caramelized onions, eggplant, chunks of lamb, and a fried boiled egg. The flavors and textures all went well together. I did think it was odd though that there was one salty and spicy fish fritter inside. It was only about 1″ in diameter so we just ate that first and ate the rest mixed together. The red sauce/gravy provided is unnecessary. My favorite thing about the Lamprais is the base heat. It's not immediately spicy, but it builds in your mouth over time and never got too hot (at least for me).The String Hopper Kottu (we chose chicken) seems to be like a fried rice, but with chopped crepe instead of rice. It's served with that same red sauce that came with the Lamprais, but this time we used it. The dish was quite bland and under-seasoned on it's own.The Hopper was most interesting, something I had never seen or tasted before. A batter is formed into a bowl-shaped crepe, thicker on the bottom, with holes towards the top. We received four, one with an egg inside, which didn't add much for me.The hopper doesn't have a lot of flavor on it's own. It is meant to be eaten with a filling (we chose vegetable) and/or chili paste.For dessert, we shared the Wattalapan, described as a baked mousse. The dessert is like a hard, dense jello, tasting of only jaggery, with the texture of a few nuts on top. The nuts didn't have any flavor though; we had to ask to find that out that they were cashews.

Tzatziki
CONTENT
I love Tzatziki and make it pretty often in the summer. It's so refreshing, a perfect way to balance spicy dishes or meats coming off a barbecue grill. After making it in many different ways, I've decided on a recipe: I chose to use kirby cucumbers because the regular or garden cucumbers can be watery and flavorless (at least in NY). I specified Fage yogurt because it is my favorite yogurt and I would not use any other yogurt to make Tzatziki. If you want to try other yogurts, use a strained yogurt or ones as thick as Fage. American yogurts are too loose and will not work.Jessica's Tzatziki~serves 2-3 as appetizer or side1. Sprinkle kosher salt over the kirby slices and let sit for 30 minutes.2. Drain and pat dry with paper towels.3. Add garlic, dill, and yogurt. Stir together and rest in the fridge for 20 minutes.4. Season (taste the tzaziki before seasoning because you've already salted the cucumbers) and serve immediately.*note: This is a reasonable portion to eat in one sitting with 2-3 people so you should try to finish it. Leaving it in the fridge overnight is ok but sometimes the cucumbers will let out more water.

I tried the recipe, but sadly did not have dill.  It was really  quite good (I also used extra garlic).  I'll definitely do this again, with dill and I might even add a couple of drops of lemon to bring out some high notes.  Of course tzatziki is meant to be creamy, but I like a touch of acid in mine.

Sushi Yasuda # 14
CONTENT
I think this is visit #14 to Sushi Yasuda. (I forgot to number it last time.) I can't believe I still always have new fish to write about. Tonight, we had Tarpon, the red colored one on the left. Depending on the part of the fish, the flesh ranges from deep red to almost purple, a very striking piece. It tastes very much like non-fatty tuna but the meat is more loosely packed together. Blackfish, on the right, is actually a pinkish colored flesh inside and tastes much like other white fish.Octopus eggs is one of the most unique pieces I've ever had. The tiny eggs are packed so tightly together that it tastes like one piece. The eggs don't have much flavor on their own, but it is paired with a shiso leaf and sweetened with something, making the overall taste very different from most nigiri. It ended up being too sweet for me but I'm still glad I tried it, especially since it's only available once a year.

Inside the Despana Basket: Afuega'l Pitu
CONTENT
I was so excited to try the big ball of cheese in the basket, the Afuega'l Pitu. This one was the red variety made with paprika and/or cayenne. The texture looked great, similar to fresh goat cheese. I was planning on spreading it everywhere.The gentlemen answering the phone at Despana didn't seem to think it had gone bad. I described the blue spot and the tingling and he seemed to explain it away so I guess I have now found a cheese which I do not like. This is a very sad realization for me since cheese has always been my BFF.

The Price of Food

Have you been feeling like the price of food is much higher all of the sudden? If so, you'd be right. A recent agricultural post from the Cattle Network compares the price of various food stuffs between May 2007 and May 2008.I've mostly heard dairy prices rising, and while eggs and milk are up, it seems the field crops are getting slammed the most. We shouldn't be surprised there have been constant articles about the wheat prices rising and the whole world is still looking for rice.p.s. Who knew there was a Cattle Network: The Source for Cattle News? Wow, I love it. I'm making it my browser default homepage!

It truly has come on like a sudden splitting headache. The sad part is, the expensive hippie co-op here used to be out of my price range, and all of a sudden, their prices are looking fair. People out here, to offset the cost of fruits and veggies, have started using the organic plotting farms where they can grow their own food, and the farmer's markets have never been more crowded. I'm thinking of opening up my massive veggie garden to neighbors and friends, as I have saved about a hundred dollars so far on fruits and veggies grown in my own soil.

Ippudo
CONTENT
I'm generally bored of the modern look these days but Ippudo Ippudo manages to have that clean modern look, without feeling stale. $13 and up seems steep for a bowl of noodles, but I figured I would just try it once.My assumptions were all wrong. I was expecting a glorified version of the ramen packets you get at Asian markets...you know, those 75 cents dry ramen bags (which I admit I like), jazzed up with some pork and vegetables, served in a fancy bowl. Forget that image completely. This was a bowl of fresh chewy noodles in a rich and robust stock, richer than any Japanese soup I've ever had. I ordered the \"Modern\" version which has the addition of a garlic paste and Ippudo's special sauce. It seemed like the perfect winter comfort food, a bit heavy for the current weather, but I was still impressed. A wonderful slice of Berkshire pork, seaweed, scallions, and pieces of minced pork all added to my enjoyment. It was something new to me.I looked over at my friend Sara, enjoying the original recipe. The broth was rich enough on it's own and more suitable for summer. You can see how both soups are opaque. It definitely makes you feel like you got your money's worth.The meal at Ippudo was enlightening. I had never had Japanese food like this before but I'm glad I now have. I will be back with Lon of course.

I have yet to try Ippudo and am dying to got there! I love ramen! Ramen Setagaya is one of my personal favorite places to have ramen, you should go check it out! It's a really small place so it can get pretty crowded and usually always has a wait but it's definately worth the while!

This is an unusual introduction to the world of ramen. For the record, the noodles they use are not what's used in traditional ramen. These noodles closely resemble Chinese egg noodles.The broth is way too rich for me. It's like they melted the pork fat in there too. The taste is good, but for my heart's sake, I can't drink it.Now that you're hooked on ramen (please don't call the Maruchan stuff ramen ... to me, they're called instant noodles), you have quite a few choices in the city to choose from.It's got good flavor, but I prefer more traditional ramen, more traditional prices, and more traditional wait times.

I'll have to try this place just because it's so close! I really like the ramen at Menkui Tei in midtown as well. I believe it was the Tonkotsu ramen that I liked - the broth is a pale color. I go here when I have lunch with my brother in midtown.

Thanks Wonders, will give Ramen Setagaya a try.C, I am no ramen expert for sure. I was never that interested in it. However, I don't think Ippudo's noodles resemble Chinese egg noodles, which I am quite familiar with.The broth is very rich but as long as I'm keeping up with my workouts, I think I'll allow myself....I also wouldn't say I'm hooked on ramen but I will be more open to it now.I'm also not a fan of lines, which is why I went during lunch, no wait.Caroline, I'll give Menkui Tei a try too while I'm at it....

I've had ramen at ippudo, setagaya, menchanko, and rairaiken. if you take into account price, taste, ingredients, and dining experience, then RAIRAIKEN is #1!the place is tiny and the "kitchen" is the restaurant. you sit on a round chair stool and depending on how big the person sitting next to you is, you might be sitting elbow to elbow. but who cares, service is fast and the cook reaches over and places a bowl of delicious ramen right in front of you.the broth at ippudo is definitely more rich and flavorful but for me ramen is not supposed to be enjoyed in a fancy schmancy restaurant with rock music blaring out of the speakers.

My experience with XJ at Ippudo was more negative than positive.I agree that the flavor of the broth, while very tasty, is almost on the verge of being too rich and salty. I guess they figured with the extra "quality" of the broth, they can charge an extra higher price. A bowl of ramen noodles should not exceed $10. An analogous situation would be eating Chinese food in midtown establishments like Mr. K's. Chinese food should not priced at those levels.Another major factor for our negative experience was the time spent waiting for a table, and the speed of the service. Granted, we dined at Ippudo during the first month or so when it opened, and everyone and their mother wanted to eat there. We waited over 1 hour for a table. When we were finally seated, we looked around and noticed at least 4 empty tables, that could've seated at least 12 people. Also, our waitress was not only slow in coming to take our order, but very slow in delivering our dishes. I chalked this all up to an inexperienced wait staff. But you'd think with the level of quality the management put into designing the ambience, they'd train the staff better.Finally, for some reason the background music changed from enjoyable Japanese reggae, to heavy Rage Against the Machine. And it was played a decibel level that made our entire experience close to being awful.Despite the quality of the food, and the probability that the service has improved, I probably would not go back to Ippudo.

Looks like I have a lot of ramen eating to catch up on....but I'll postpone till winter since I'm not craving hot bowls of soup right now.Xiu and Andy, Sara and I went during lunch so no wait, no rush, it wasn't loud inside, can't even remember the music, our waitress was fine....which does amount to a very different experience.I think you can only blame yourself for standing on a long line though. You knew it would take that long.

I went to Rairaiken before and did not notice any differences in their ramen compared to Menchanko or Sapporo.  At least I can taste a difference in the broth and the noodle in Ippudo.  Maybe it's due to the timing of our visit to Ippudo and they had significantly improved their service since they opened but I thought everything was above par.  I do cringe at the price of their ramen but I could also see myself going there again during those cold winter months ahead.

Ippudo doesn't taste the same way in Japan. The broth isn't thick, but the noodles are still thin. I'm not saying that they are Chinese egg noodles, but the resemblance, style, and consistency are similar. My friend in Hokkaido who went to one in Japan and shared with me his experiences agreed. "Tampopo" is a classic tongue-in-cheek Japanese movie about ramen and some sensuality. It may be of interest considering the topic.

I meant that he agreed that it was thin. He also said it was very tasty and for only about 600 yen. We're getting fleeced.  I'll have to try it out when I go to Tokyo in Aug.

C, I think Ippudo is a chain from Japan, and there may be difference between Ramen places in Japan too. While I have no authority to say whether Ippudo is authentic or not, I do think the noodles and broth taste good, and yes, ultra rich, again, perfect for winter months.I'm so jealous of your trip to Japan. I'm dying to to go!

Olive Oil from Greece

We were ecstatic upon tasting it. It was indeed full and fruity, smooth, and could make your eyes roll back into your head. For the last three nights, we've been eating way too much bread because of this incredible olive oil. I seriously crave it all day long. It's insane. I was never the type to dip my bread in olive oil, probably because the olive oil here is just not worth the calories. I usually opt to just eat the bread plain, which I really like. But no, the bread basket will never be the same to me, ever again.We couldn't find this online anywhere, but the bottle lists the email address voskakis {a t} hol { dot } gr (sorry for the funny format, but that will help the recipient avoid spam and a phone number of +30-2810-381990.

Inside the Despana Basket: Jamon Iberico
CONTENT
You could just sit there, eating the thin slices with your head dipped back. That's how some of the slices disappeared. Last night, I decided to serve it with thinly sliced honey dew and canteloupe. The melons were perfectly ripe and fork tender, making a perfect pairing. (btw, we ate an entire loaf of bread sopping up that olive oil we got from Greece.)We had left-over nova, so I sliced some rustic Italian bread, topped it with a slice of nova, threw on capers, red onions, and tomato concasse. Fast and refreshing.

Homemade Peanut Butter Cups

Our niece Sabrina had a fabulous backyard first birthday party yesterday. Bonnie, Sabrina's grandma, made burgers, hot dogs, cedar plank salmon, potato and pasta salads, fruit, and desserts, the works! Of course, I had to make something. Sabrina doesn't eat much solid food yet but she'll see these pictures in the future and I am just ensuring my spot as favorite aunt.I have been waiting till after the wedding to make peanut butter cups because they are pretty decadent.Homemade Peanut Butter Cups~makes 24 minis1. Line mini muffin tin with mini paper muffin cups.2. Melt half the chocolate chips in a microwave safe bowl. Melt on high for 1 minute, stir, and an additional 30 seconds if necessary.3. Spoon chocolate into muffin cups and use the spoon to coat the bottom and sides of each cup.4. Refrigerate until firm, roughly 15 minutes.5. Whip together peanut butter, salt, and confectioner's sugar. Spoon into each chocolate cup.6. Melt the remaining chocolate the same way you did the first batch. Cover each cup with chocolate and try to smooth the tops.7. Refrigerate until firm. Whether you serve room temperature or straight out of the fridge is a personal preference. I like it room temperature.Variations

Mini is relative also.  These are bigger than a mini Reese's peanut butter cup. Actually they are probably similar to a regular Reese's, but higher and smaller diameter.The chocolate sprinkles were added yumminess.  My only comment is that if someone makes these and wants them to taste like Reese's, add a bit more sugar to the PB.

Curried Crab over Rice
CONTENT
There used to be a wonderful Indian restaurant on 58th Street, where from time to time I'd enjoy their Curried Crab appetizer. For $12, one could have a pint of curry-flavored crab. Every bite was amazing. Unfortunately they went out of business and I haven't had the dish in a while.This weekend Jessica's mom dropped off four medium-sized, steamed blue crabs, shipped in a bushel from Maryland (the crabs we talked about from Harbor House). Jessica ate two of them straight (they are seasoned with Old Bay) and left two for me. So last night I spent well over an hour picking all the meat out of them so I could recreate the curry dish. I think the results were worth the (extreme) effort.IngredientsInstructionsThe rice I served it over was super easy to make and really added to the dish. I didn't measure the ingredients, but it's just medium grain white rice, with a few shakes of turmeric, garlic powder, and table salt added to the water used to steam it. I made about 3/4 cup (uncooked) rice and served in a mound.Enjoy!

Sushi Yasuda

We missed Sushi Yasuda Sushi Yasuda so much. As soon as we got back from the honeymoon, we made reservations. I was extra excited to go this time because we brought a gift for Chef Tomura. I had read that it was common in Japan for patrons to bring gifts to their sushi chefs. Since then, I had been plotting to bring him back something from Greece, olive oil!As soon as we sat down, I noticed something on the menu we hadn't seen before, Tripletail. If you're one to eat with your eyes, this is one eye-catching piece of fish. The translucent flesh, bordered by a strip of magenta, is firm and has more bounce than most white fish. We both loved it.Flying Fish, which comes from Japan, was another interesting texture. As you bite in, it is again firm, but also shreds. You could pull it apart like cooked chicken.My last piece was Squid Fin. It is much more delicate than the body of the squid which is nice because there is almost no resistance to biting through. (Each piece of sushi usually takes me more than 1 bite.)

ABC Chinese Restaurant
CONTENT
We missed Father's Day while we were on honeymoon so we made sure to celebrate soon after our return. We had planned to go for Peking duck but the restaurant was booked for the night, a second choice had a long wait, and we ended up at ABC Chinese Restaurant ABC Chinese Restaurant. All because most of Chinatown doesn't take reservations. There's always a down side right.It ended up being a pretty average Cantonese style restaurant, with a standard menu, nothing exciting but nothing bad either. We started with a Beef and Egg Drop Soup, which was a tad too salty, but everyone was so hungry, we devoured it.Beef with Chinese Broccoli was tasty but oily, common of Cantonese food.Salt and Pepper Shrimp is a bit different here. These were completely shelled, coated, and fried. The coating was so light and crispy. The shrimp were perfectly cooked, had snap, and were very meaty. This was Lon's favorite dish of the night. The shrimp were very good, but he loved the fried vermicelli, jalapenos, and fried shallots underneath.Our waiter pulled our fish out of the tank and brought it over to my mother for approval. Our family usually gets the simple steamed preparation with scallion, ginger, and soy sauce. This is a great way to have such fresh fish, where the flavor of the fish itself is really highlighted.Chicken and Salted Fish Fried Rice is probably my favorite version of fried rice. This one was nice and fluffy but average in flavor.Some Chinese restaurant give complimentary warm dessert soups at the end of the meal, and almost always, oranges. Most dessert soups are skimpy, with only a few beans, maybe a few tapioca, but this one was chunky, full of beans, tapioca, taro, barley, and maybe more. It wasn't too sweet and I really enjoyed it.

We missed Stephen's birthday during our honeymoon so we had to celebrate as soon as we got back. We ended up in my old high school neighborhood, at One Fish Two Fish One Fish Two Fish. Wow, does the area look different. The restaurant feels spacious, which is a rare pleasure in Manhattan when you're back is usually up against a strangers. Unlimited salad, 1 basket of garlic bread per table, and one side dish is included. They started out with a good impression.Sadly, the food did not impress but I'm not complaining to loudly because it was cheap and you get what you pay for. There was a wonderful aroma of garlic that we assume was coming from the garlic bread. Oddly, the bread tasted buttered, but not garlicky at all.

What's Up With Sammy's Noodle Shop?
CONTENT
On the last day of our honeymoon, we had to eat breakfast (same buffet) at 5am in the morning because Princess Cruise Lines forced us to meet at 5:30am in the lobby, to have us arrive at the airport at 7am, for a flight that was at 11:55am. We couldn't even check in till 9am so we had to sit by the entrance of the airport for two hours, before our 3 hour wait. I did pack up a bunch of stuff (croissant, danish, muffin, apple, small box of raisin bran) to munch on in the airport, more out of boredom than hunger.I decided not to get into the airplane food because it's not that interesting. Let's just say, the food on British Airways was slightly better than the food on Lufthansa (on our way there), but it was still recognizably airplane food.We landed in New York a bit passed 6pm and got home close to 8pm. By now, we had been awake for 22 hours already. We were hungry and I really missed Chinese food. Unfortunately, the closest we have to Chinese food by us is Sammy's Noodle Shop Sammy's Noodle Shop. (Generally, I stick to the noodle and dumpling stuff.) They do have very fast delivery! The weird thing is that most of it tasted very different. Did they change chefs/owners?The one thing that tasted the same was their scallion pancakes which are doughy and not layer-y, as they should be. I don't like them but Lon eats it. The pork dumplings, which we've had many times, definitely tasted different. They were smaller. The dough had less spring to it, bordering on gummy, and the meat didn't taste fresh. (Sorry, pics of these were blurry.)We also ordered a Chicken Pad Thai that didn't even taste like Asian food. Actually, it didn't taste like anything.The worst was the Dza-Jiang Mien (they call it Noodles with Bean Paste and Minced Meat Sauce) which I've had before at Sammy's. There was no bean paste in it, which means it just tasted like minced meat in soy sauce and sugar, again, that did not taste fresh. The noodles were over-cooked and mushy. It was really terrible.Sammy's used to come close to Chinese food, at least their dumpling and noodle dishes were passable. Now I feel left with nothing. I'm going to have to move.BTW, thanks everyone for joining us on our honeymoon. We love sharing with all of you. We both weighed in at 5lbs heavier than before our trip. Sadly, 5 lbs on me (a short 5′3″) is more than 5 lbs on Lon. Stay tuned for more eating adventures!

Naples, Italy
CONTENT
BreakfastAnother quick breakfast and we were off to see the city of Naples.Too Much SnackingShortly after getting off the boat, we spotted a cafe, which are all over the place. In Italy, it seems that cafes look a little like small bars, but people are standing around drinking cafes (what we think of as espresso). I wanted to try one so we took it to go since we don't speak Italian. Everyone standing at the bar was chatting away.I was afraid I wouldn't like it since I don't like espresso. It's usually too bitter for me. Surprisingly, this cafe was smooth, only slightly bitter, and I really enjoyed it. My heart did start racing though -way too much caffeine for me.A little later, Lon popped into another cafe to get Pizette. All of them had these fluffy focaccia-like breads. It wasn't heated enough but delicious anyway.Not very much time had passed when we spotted another cute shop, full of sandwiches, savory pastries, and antipasto. Everything looked so good and unique, but we agreed to settle on two items so we wouldn't explode. The Spinach Ricotta Tart was soft and mild, a perfect little snack.The Prosciutto Popover was even more unique. The mildly sweet and crumbly top was an excellent example of a popover and the bottom was soft, with a little bit of prosciutto in it. We ate the top first and the bottom was such a nice finish, something warm, moist, and savory, after a little bit of sweetness.Fantasia GelatiWe came across some very enticing looking gelati.We were not hungry...actually, I will still feeling very full, but Lon had to try the blue one. We couldn't understand what they said the flavor was and Lon couldn't tell from eating it either. He said it just tasted like sugar. I tried the pineapple flavor, as recommended by an anonymous comment, and it was bursting with yummy pineapple fruitiness. Lon and I shared a cone with kiwi and banana, both tasting like real fruit, smooth and rich, yet tangy.Pizza & SfiziRight next door was a pizza shop, Pizza & Sfizi, and since Lon was walking in and inspecting every one, why not this one? He took a picture of the pie with hot dogs and french fries, one we had been seeing everywhere. Here, they called it the Viennese and at the place we had lunch, they called it the American. Haha. I convinced Lon not to get a slice though since it would be lunch time soon and we had eaten so much already!!LunchBased on a local guy's recommendation, we went to a pizza and pasta restaurant (I'm going to find the name later). It started out with a basket of bread, as you'd expect. The texture was wonderful, crusty on the outside and extremely spongy (if you press down, it springs back immediately). Oddly, it was also very salty but I ate it anyway. We were surprised that no olive oil was provided though.After checking out the menu, I told Lon I wanted the Margherita Pizza and went to use the lady's room. When I returned, the dishes began flowing and seemed to never end. Lon asked the waiter to choose an assortment of antipasto for us, which began with a fried plate: fried dough balls which were the savory version of zeppole, fried polenta, and fried cod. I loved the doughy texture of the dough balls, very hot, with the the thin crispy exterior, but I didn't care for the other two. Lon likes anything fried.The Bruschetta was exciting for me because I had been eye-ing all the tomatoes being sold on the streets. They were so intensely red, tasting as magnificently as they looked, making me really sad about the tomatoes we have in New York.This salmon preparation impressed both of us. We had never seen such salmon before. It was sliced thinly showing beautiful fat lines, the color looked poached, the texture seemed partially cured. We couldn't really figure it out but we loved it.The Octopus Salad was fresh and tender, but the few piec es of mussels in it, were the pieces that wowed me. Again, these mussels were the sweetest and plumpest mussels we've had.Then, there was a Sliced Octopus Salad, which was visually appealing and tasty. It presented a very different texture, a more delicate one, that I like more than whole.I was already full by now but that didn't stop me from eating. When in Naples, you have to have pizza right? The center was a bit too wet, softening the crust, but as you got towards the outer ring, the crust got more and more amazing. The sauce tasted so fresh, the cheese was so creamy, and I really wish I could have eaten more.We finished with Bucatini Amatriciana, perefectly al dente pasta, packed with rich bacon and pecorino, just a bit of heat. The sauce really stuck to the pasta. Each bite was heavenly for us and we tried so hard to finish it but couldn't.Our waiter was very friendly and offered us two complimentary glasses of chilled cafe. It was a perfect end to our meal. The coffee flavor and sugar was balanced nicely, and the frothy and creamy texture was thick and indulgent.Most of the food here was fantastic, exceeding our expectations, but it was heavy on the salt. It was clear that the quality of ingredients is what makes the food stand-out. We just don't get tomatoes and mussels like this in New York.DinnerIt was the last night on the ship and I was really sick of the dining room. The food is better there than the buffet but I just didn't want to sit in the same room anymore. (They have two dining rooms but they are identical.) We headed to the buffet where food was less than impressive for the farewell dinner.Lon's plate: Veal meatballs that were gamey, dry tasteless chicken, and dry tasteless rice. Those fritters you see are supposed to be clam fritters but between the two of us, we had 7 fritters and only found two minuscule pieces of clam. The fried turkey cutlet was the only decent item. It surprised us by not being too dry.He also picked up a seafood salad, which he said was ok.The Curried Chicken Salad was dry, even with the mayo.I tried the same meatballs and clam-less clam fritters as Lon, but also had extra fatty rib eye, over-cooked broccoli and cauliflower, and a penne with clam sauce that tasted like canned food. The only thing I liked was the Mushroom and Leek Ragout.I also picked up a plate of grilled veggies that were sad and tasteless. I blame stuff like this for why some kids won't eat vegetables. (Pic was blurry but no loss, it was regular looking.)The chocolate Peanut Butter Pie was not memorable.In hindsight, we shouldn't have eaten that meal at all. It was a waste of time and calories. I'm sure we ate enough for two days while in Naples so it was really unnecessary.

Asianmommy, why can't our espresso be good here?MJ, thanks for the recommendation, delicious! ....I would've eaten more but I had a little canker sore and Chinese people believe that  pineapple is a "hot" food, which causes canker sores.

Neon blue gelato?  That looks scary.  You should try a gelato shop that doesn't put fruit on top of their gelato, those are usually the most authentic ones.

TITLE
Another Day at Sea
CONTENT
BreakfastIt's a long way between Santorini and Naples so it's a whole day at sea. It's great cause we can relax and sun bathe but bad cause we'll be eating a lot without the walking a lot. We slept in and it was too late to eat in the dining room so we had to join the crowded buffet for the same old food that I'm sick of.DemoChef Alfredo Marzi is the head chef for all 18 fleets of the Princess line. We, along with a surprisingly large crowd, watched him demo a few dishes and promote his cookbook. Honestly, it put Lon and I to sleep but we waited around because we wanted the tour of the kitchen. It did look very clean, except for the raw chicken left out, with no one tending to it.LunchLunch started with a very sad Thai Hot & Sour Soup. It tasted like I was drinking packets of sauce.Lon's Stuffed Calamari wasn't much better, tough and chewy, with a random meat filling that had no particular flavor.The Tagliarini with Meatballs were better, well at least we ate it. The pasta was over-cooked, the sauce a bit too acidic, but the meatballs were decent. In the end, I guess you can always eat pasta with meatballs.I ordered the cheeseburger and then realized that the waiter never asked me how I would like it. The burger arrived just as I was finishing my thought. Of course it was well done, but somehow the cheese wasn't even melted. I asked if it was possible to get it rare (which we learned was the way to get medium rare) and I did eventually get a decent rare burger that we finished. The fries weren't cooked enough but I ate half of them, picking out the crispier ones.Lon ordered the Key Lime Pie after seeing that it looked nothing like the one from the night before. This was indeed better.I ordered the Bread & Butter Pudding which was a bit too eggy flavored for me but it was nice and tender. I also asked for a scoop of hazelnut ice cream on the side which was very good, creamy with a few bits of hazelnut lingering.After lying around in the sun most of the day and then a few minutes of ping pong (we gave up cause it was too windy to play), we got a snack to eat on our balcony. In the afternoon, you can get sandwiches made to order at the buffet. Lon took advantage and had two. The mango ice cream (today's flavors were mango and pistachio) was very creamy but I would've liked more mango flavor.We also picked up the pizza of the day, white pizza, which was ok.Dinner at Sabitini'sWe shouldn't have had the afternoon snack. We were still full when we went to Sabitini's for our 6pm reservation. Sabatini's is one of two restaurants on the ship that you pay extra ($20 per person) for a fancier meal. We had no idea that it was a tasting menu. We both really wished we had bigger appetites because it was a lot better than the standard dining room. Right off the bat, the bread basket is loaded with wonderfully soft and fluffy focaccia.The starters are all served Russian Service, starting with a prosciutto and melon salad. It was about the same I would expect from an average restaurant in Manhattan.The shrimp and artichoke salad was good, but not memorable.The antipasto selection, olives, mushrooms, roasted peppers, roasted tomato, cheese (maybe Pecorino?) were all pretty good but the anchovies tasted like pickled herring which I liked but Lon didn't.The ricotta flan was tender with a subtle cheesiness that balanced perfectly with the tomato. The crab cake was piping hot and the outside was crisp but both of us didn't like the crab inside. It just tasted like cheap stuff.The fried zucchini really wowed Lon, lightly sweetened with a really thin batter, fried perfectly al dente. The calalmari wasn't any better than fast food though.The Tomato Seafood Soup was great. The seafood was all tender, the tomato was balanced, and the olive oil and herbs were such a nice touch.I thought it was weird that both pastas were cheese or cream based but I enjoyed both. The Paparedelle with thin strips of asparagus, baby spinach, and mushrooms was rich and aromatic. The pasta was cooked perfectly.The Ricotta Ravioli was even better, so soft, the tender pasta melted and gave way to the creamy ricotta filling. Just heavenly.Our waiter recommended two main courses so Lon had the lobster tail and I had the Sea Bass. Both were great but overly buttery and decadent.The lobster tail was presented nicely, but Lon couldn't help wishing it was Spiny Lobster, instead of the American lobster we're used to. I think we're forever ruined.His sides were also good, a risotto with pumpkin seeds and pumpkin puree.My Sea Bass was so tender and flaky. The herb crust was nice. The salad and asparagus on this plate were certainly better than the ones in the standard dining room. The vegetables just looked brighter and fresher.We tried so hard to finish but did leave a few bites. Had we known it was going to be a tasting menu, we probably would've skipped the afternoon snack.Before desserts we got a plate of nice cookies. The amaretto and pignoli cookies were similar, a chewy cookie that was still light and airy. I didn't taste the biscotti since I was already ready to burst.I got the Tiramisu which was good but not memorable.Lon's White Chocoloate Mousse with Limoncello was amazing. It was more like ice cream than mousse and just so well balanced. I usually don't like white chocolate because it's too sweet but this one was great.We didn't join in the activities on the boat that night. We were both stuffed and in pain, returning to our room, to just lie in bed for the rest of the night. We wanted to be awake early for Naples, Italy.

Santorini, Greece
CONTENT
BreakfastBreakfast was standard. Lon ate another one of those chocolate almond pastries but I resisted the platter of donuts.Getting LostSantorini was by far my favorite stop, which is no surprise. Everyone raves about it and it is truly wonderful. Our boat anchored out in the water. We boarded tenders to get to shore, where we road the cable cars up the steep mountain side (while watching others ride donkeys up the mountain), arriving right in Fira, another touristy town. We decided to rent a Go Cart-like four wheeler to see more of the island in the few hours we had. First stop would be the famous black beach, Perissa. We got a little lost even though there's only a handful of roads on Santorini. The good thing is that we found an area free of tourists where we stopped at a bakery. As soon as you entered, there was an amazing aroma of fresh baked breads. The shop was full of local restaurateurs picking up bread for the day. We bought two to try and we headed out. I went to look for a bathroom and by the time I got back, Lon had eaten half the loaf (about 2 feet long). I ate the other half as we drove towards the beach. It was crunchy and crusty on the outside, soft on the inside, and warm, having just come out of the oven.Perissa BeachThe black sand beach is lined with cafes, with umbrellas and beach chairs (which you pay to use). The black sand looks a little like black sesame seeds and gets painfully hot, so I didn't really move off my chair. I ordered a frappe as suggested by an anonymous comment. They have been all over Greece so I was very excited. It looks great but tastes just ok. I like that you can order it just moderately sweet but I thought it was a bit acidic.LunchWe drove all the way to the other end of the island to have lunch at Sunset Taverna in Ammoudi Bay. A few locals claimed that it is the best restaurant on their island and it exceeded our expectations. First of all, it started with great bread, something that hadn't happened at any of the Greek restaurants yet. The Greek Salad (with those wonderfully sweet raw onions) had great capers and olives, but the rest was average.The Lobster Spaghetti (which the waiter said they are known for) was the best lobster and/or pasta dish either of us have ever had! The roughly 2 pound Spiny Lobster (which we saw alive before it was cooked) was so tender and naturally sweet. The pasta was flavored with a uniquely delicious sauce that we tried to figure out. It was definitely made with lobster stock and lobster roe, which made it so rich and decadent. The aroma of onions, garlic, and maybe scallions. The tang of a bit of tomato and some orange. Lon asked about an herb that the waiter said is close to oregano (looks a little like seaweed). We stuffed ourselves, determined to eat as much as possible of it, since we would likely never have it again.Sail AwayRight after lunch, we had to rush back to our ship, where we sat on our balcony to snack on the Easter bread we bought at the bakery earlier. It looked so good but it was dry and we didn't finish it.DinnerThis evening, the dining room was serving the Chef's dinner, which was satisfactory but not that impressive. The Quail Terrine was pretty good, nicely balanced against the preserves, but not something I'll miss.The salad, which was labeled Boston Lettuce Salad didn't actually have any Boston Lettuce in it. Generally, salads have been boring anyway and this one was no more exciting, just romaine, onions, and cherry tomatoes.The intermezzo sorbet course was too sweet for me.We both had the crab legs, which were pretty standard, along with standard asparagus, and a waxy potato.The dessert trio included a raspberry mousse (colored so I didn't try it), a standard chocolate and coffee cream cake, and a pretty good peanut butter panna cotta.After dinnerLon grabbed a Mexican Pizza (beans were al dente which was weird on pizza) before heading over to the Cosmopolitan Buffet where nothing looked appetizing. I did try the miso and tofu soup that had no miso but did have some mushrooms. It was salty and generally uninteresting.Movie Under The StarsOne of the coolest things on the ship is \"Movie Under The Stars\". There is a mega large screen right on the deck, above the center pool, where a different movie is played ev ery night. We sat on the lounge chairs with the blankets they provided, and of course, we were eating. Lon picked up a Key Lime Mousse Pie (not so good) and cookies from the buffet.

Rhodes, Greece
CONTENT
Breakfast Nothing interesting about the buffet breakfast today.LunchRhodes is also very touristy, but at least there's more to see than just stores. We walked through the Palace of the Grand Masters, which exhibits ancient jugs, bowls, jewelry, etc. within beautiful stone and marble walls. We took plenty of great photos before looking for lunch, where we were at a loss. Every place looked the same: full of tourists, expensive, with back garden, sidewalk, or roof top seating. We chose one a little bit away from the rest, but it didn't help. I was hoping to have a great Greek Salad like the one at Alefkandra (in Mykonos), but this one was like any you could get in New York, with one exception: the onions were sweet. I had no idea onions were so great in Greece!We chose a sampler platter of Greek Salads that was also no better than stuff you could get in New York. The Aubergine Salad was standard. There was a cheese and mayo salad which tasted like chunky mayo. The Taramosalata didn't taste like much, just salty yogurt. There was another cheese spread that looked clumpy and didn't grab my attention either. The Tzaziki was just yogurt and cucumbers, no garlic, no dill.We forgot to take a picture of the Mixed Souvlaki, but it looked like any other plate with one skewer of meat, mediocre rice, and awful, water-logged carrots. There was one good thing on the expensive platter, thinly sliced and layered potato gratin, it was tender and cheesy.Greek SpecialtiesWe stopped in at Natura Greca and bought more olive oil and olives. Yup, we're really stocking up. Then we spotted Kaberis Coffee & Spices and it got me interested in Greek coffee. They blend and grind coffee, but don't brew on site. The proprietor, Stavros, recommended going a few stores down to try the coffee. They are cooked in special little pots. Sugar can be added, but no milk or cream.I enjoyed the smooth taste, which had almost no acidity. Afterwards I went back to Kaberis to buy the coffee and the little pot.DinnerI don't think I've mentioned this yet, every night it annoys me the way that butter is served in our dining room. The butter florettes are served in little slotted bowls (with another bowl underneath) with some ice on top. Does this look appetizing to you? The idea is that the ice will keep it cold and then drip through to the second bowl beneath as it melts. I already hate the idea of having ice or water mix in with my butter, even a little bit, but often it gets worse when the melted ice pools and over fills until the butter is just immersed in water.Other than annoying butter service, it was a rather good night for the dining room. We both started with Big Eye Tuna Sashimi, which was a far cry from Sushi Yasuda quality. They did a nice job searing the tuna evenly and then slicing and presenting it nicely. Lon felt the grapefruit was out of place. On the ship they often garnish with items that don't make sense; that is, the garnish is not an ingredient in the dish itself, just a random item.I had a decent second appetizer, Grilled Calamari on Fennel Salad. The calamari was nice and tender, but didn't taste like anything. I don't like raw fennel, so I skipped the salad.Lon had an Oxtail Rotelle, which was overwhelmingly buttery, but he enjoyed it - clearing the bowl. He was hoping it would have more than just little bits of meat though.I ordered the Shrimp Kebabs and was pleasantly surprised by perfectly cooked shrimp with snap and all. The salsa was a bit week but it was served with the good rice (like the night before).The desserts were also pretty good. Lon had a Chocolate Banana Brioche Pudding that was soft and creamy with the tang of fresh bananas. It was more like flan than brioche pudding, which means Lon didn't like it. The funny thing is that they often have desserts with the same name at the buffet, but that look different. Later in the evening, we saw a Chocolate Banana Brioche Pudding at the buffet that looked more like bread pudding.My Coffee Creme Brulee was very smooth, creamy, and full of coffee flavor. The brulee was done perfectly, a very thin and crisp layer. As much as I loved this dessert, it was quite sweet so I'm concerned about the desserts getting sweeter.Second Dinner The theme of the buffet tonight was Rijstafel, which we learned means \"rice table\". We tried a few stews and fried things, a rice and lentil salad, and of course, dessert. I only like the fried mozzarella ball (melted cheese can do no wrong) and the lamb meatballs.<a title=\"second dinner by L Bo Dee, on Flickr\" href= \"http://www.flickr.com/photos/lonbinder/2583508578/\">I have learned not to expect too much from the food on board and I am quite disappointed in the food in Greece today. Rhodes did not offer us the food I expected. The olive oil was still great. Santorini next!

Kusadasi, Turkey
CONTENT
Breakfast I was excited to see an interesting variety of quiches at the buffet this morning. Unfortunately, they were ice cold, just pulled from the fridge. I couldn't eat it and I really wanted to. There were flavors like mushroom leek, artichoke goat cheese, sausage and potato, etc. Too bad...Shopping and Apple Tea Kusadasi is known for shopping. It is the 2nd largest bazaar in Turkey and Lon calls it Disney World for women. Leather (clothing and handbags), jewelry, carpet, and souvenir stores are repeated street after street where all the vendors are eager to make sales. Most sales people will offer you Turkish Apple Tea, which most of them are drinking themselves and bringing to each other. I enjoyed the hospitable culture. The apple tea is quite good, tasting more like a lightly sweetened warm apple juice than tea.Lunch Lon asked the hotel manager, where we were using the Internet, where we could get good local food. We were extremely happy as soon as we arrived, seeing that all the patrons were locals that worked in the area, and fresh ravioli were being made right in front of us (sorry for the dark pic).I told Lon I wanted the ravioli and went to the restroom to wash my hands. I should have known he would order five dishes while I was gone. Nothing was fancy looking, all very rustic, flavorful and inexpensive. These fried things (kofte) that look like chicken nuggets were made of ground beef and rice, very tasty, but the french fries on the side were soggy.The string beans (the picture didn't work out) were over-cooked, but the tomato flavor was good and string beans are one of the few vegetables that I can deal with over-cooked.The ravioli were of course super fresh, the yogurt was light, and I thought it was a bit bland at first, but noticed a few other people adding salt, pepper, oregano, and chili flakes to theirs and followed. It was immediately better and great to dip bread in. By the way, the bread here was much better than the bread we've had at all the different stops in Greece so far.This rice dish, with chickpeas, chunks of meat, and tomato, was a great combination of textures, probably our favorite. Each grain of rice was bursting with the flavor of the stock it was cooked in, screaming of good home-cooking.The ground meat patties, potato, and eggplant dish looked oily at first, but it wasn't, actually none of the dishes were. After eating nearly everything but the French Fries, we were very full, but not feeling gross and heavy.Turkish Ice Cream On the way back to the boat, we decided we needed to try the Turkish Ice Cream that was being made throughout the bazaar. Generally, it seems to be stirred in a deep metal vat with a long metal spatula. We asked one vendor (in the port area) for a mix of vanilla and chocolate, which seem to be the only flavors available. He dropped some generous dollops into a freshly made waffle cone, which was being made as we approached. Unfortunately, we forgot to ask the price and were flabbergasted at the 6 Euro price tag (that's $9.25 USD) for a single ice cream cone! Well, he did throw in a second tiny cone for Lon that we didn't want, but we walked away upset. The flavor was mediocre, like any plain jane vanilla or fudge ice cream, almost cheap tasting. However the texture was notable. It was something like taffy ice cream -- it actually stretched as we ate it. The mouth feel was something more like candy and didn't provide that creamy richness that one expects from ice cream. However, the cone was one of the best I've had, just very fresh, not too sweet, and warm after just coming off the iron!Dinner Dinner was back to being a disappointment. We started with a crab and melon salad. The melon was sweet but there wasn't much crab flavor (probably because it was mixed with more fake crab meat than real), and the zest was over-powering.Lon had a salad course of vegetable strudel, which was better. It had a fresh soft crust with an abundant amount of filling.My entree, a Fried Red Snapper was literally chewy, which is sad since it came with a very good rice. It's the first time the rice on this boat has been light, fluffy, fragrant, and cooked correctly. Unfortunately, I had to eat it by itself.Lon managed to get medium-rare steak this time by ordering it rare. He didn't enjoy the quality of the meat though. The shrimp were pretty standard but the veggies were nicely cooked.The desserts were also a let down this time. The Sacher Torte was really just chocolate cake soaked in syrup, much sweeter than their other desserts.Lon had the sugar-free crepe. The crepe itself was good: light, eggy, and tender. The filling was a standard, sugar-free chocolate mousse. It was plated in a pool of dark chocolate that Lon felt tasted like water and ruined the dish.Second Dinner We've been having too many second dinners lately but this time it was worth it. There was a Veal Osso Bucco on the buffet and while the meat was pretty good, the bones were filled with delicious marrow that was easily extractable. I'm sad knowing that most of the bones on the ship were just thrown out.We also had some sad looking octopus salad, acceptable ribs, and too much fried seafood. They served a Frito Mixto plate of scallops, large shrimp, fish, and calamari, all heavily battered and deep fried. While the assortment matched the Mediterranean theme of the buffet, the heavy batter didn't. Lon ate quite a bit anyway (with tartar sauce, so American!).Lon took a few cookies to go as we head to the lounge for some more entertainment. So far the oatmeal cookies have been good but the chocolate chip and peanut butter ones need some work.Kusadasi was another touristy town, but at least we got a few good buys there. We'll be hitting Rhodes, Greece next.

omg the colors on that ravioli have me drooling all over the place!  it looks so good!it's too bad your cruise food isn't as good though, you should try royal caribbean, imo those are the best.  i hope you two are otherwise enjoying your vacation.  i know there's a lot to do on those ships, so maybe you can drown your food sorrows in really loud dance music.

Hi...thanks a ton for updating us with your holiday experiences. I am sure you must be enjoying all the new places. It's sad that most of the food is 'ok' to 'spitting out material'. I mean ice cold quiches! Shoot them. Still I am sure the ravioli must have been good and the cake looked awesome. i had a honey apple butter tea at Tea Centre Bombay which was quite nice. The bone marrow dish liked an Indian dish called 'nalli nihari'. Anyway seems like the food in Greece was slightly better. I think the coffee in Istanbul is famous. Did you try it? I hope your look with the menu changes...or else there is always New York

I've heard that the apple tea is often made from a powder (sometimes compared to Tang) and isn't actually very Turkish.As for the ice cream, it's usually made with Salep, powdered orchid bulbs, that give it the taffy-ish consistency.  They work it in the container before serving to stretch it out and warm it up to bring out the flavors.  Supposedly the best stuff is by Mado in Istanbul where they've modernized it and offer several interesting flavors.

Mykonos, Greece
CONTENT
BreakfastWe're about half way through the cruise and we're starting to feel full just about 24 hours a day. We actually wake up still full from the day before so we managed to avoid the donuts at the buffet this morning.LunchMykonos was really cute, although again very touristy. I loved the white buildings, the famous Pelican (who I took a photo with), the incredibly blue water, and most importantly, the delicious lunch we had. We ate at Alefkandra, an outdoor cafe (like most here), where we ate the best salad ever. It looks like a simple Greek salad but the tomatoes were extra flavorful and beefy, the raw red onions were sweet, the feta was creamy and tangy (the best either of us have ever had), even the cucumbers were special. No dressing needed!We splurged on the Mixed Seafood for Two, for 75 Euros, but it was worth it. The platter included a whole Spiny Lobster, a whole Grilled Fish, 4 large Shrimp, a whole Grilled Calamari, and lots of fried calamari. With seafood as fresh as this, simple preparations are best. The juicy lemons with a bit of some awesomely fruity olive oil (available on every table) made each bite heavenly. The Spiny Lobsters were extra sweet, tasting different from the lobsters I'm used to. The large shrimp had the tastiest legs, like crunchy shrimp chips, and we liked the heads too. We stuffed ourselves silly, but it was so enjoyable.Lon saw Baklava being served at a nearby table so he had to have it. It looked so decadent I was actually afraid to eat it. İt wasn't as sweet as it looked and didn't make the back of your throat itch. We both thought Baklava was made with pistachios, however this one was made with almonds, coconut, and maybe some other nuts, but not pistachio. We did see different flavors of Baklava (including pistachio) later on, in several shops.MandariniBefore heading back to the ship, we stopped in at Mandarini, a dessert and specialty foods shop. We picked up two bottles of olive oil, Greek Saffron, and Tahini. Can't wait to try this stuff when we get back home.DinnerLon wanted to go to the buffet tonight since it was themed Bierfest. It was certainly the best spread we've seen on the buffet so far. There was all sorts of brats and wursts, which went great with sauerkraut, red cabbage, and all the different mustards. The goulash was flavorful and paired well with the spaetzle. There was a whole bread display this time and even an ice carving. There were still some major disapointments though. The cucumber salad was a watery mess, the creole shrimp wasn't worth eating (and didn't go with the theme anyway), and the breaded and fried perch was over-cooked and cold.Two of the desserts were very good too. The apple fritter was crunchy on the outside with about half an apple inside each one. It was firm yet easy to bite through. The apple struedel was wonderful, with a fresh tender dough, soft and flaky, and the filling was only mildly sweet.I am a bit let down by how overly touristy Greece is so far (at least the towns we've been to). The village ın Mykonos had beautiful scenery but all the stores (mostly jewelry) are over-priced and we found out that nothing is made in Mykonos anyway. We did really enjoy the food though and I am glad to be having olive oil in Greece. It has been good enough to drink, bathe in, and whatever else you can imagine.The evening ended in a perfect honeymoon like setting. We sat on our private balcony, sippıng teas and coffees, watchıng the magnificent sunset, as we headed across the Aegean Sea towards Kusadasi, Turkey.

if you guys are headed to santorini...you should see if you can get a reservation at 1800 (very romantic spot) for dinner.  the other really good spot is dimitri's taverna in amoudi harbor (that's the harbor at the bottom of oia...you need to descend about 300 steps to get there).  get the merides...they're little deep fried anchovies (?)...DELICIOUS!  also...if you're looking for a caffeine kick...order yourself a "frappes".  they use nescafe for the coffee base.  sounds dubious, but it's excellent!!!

Soopling and Anonymous, we did go to Santorini. That post is now up. Unfortunately, we only got 1 meal there....would've loved to eat several more.Taste Memory, we love blogging, especially when the food is good, it helps us re-live the yumminess.Dondon, Mykonos was certainly cute. It was probably better 20 years ago with less tourists though.Asianmommy, baklava is normally too sweet for me in NY but this one was n't as sugary...Andy, you're totally right! There was about 4000 passengers on our ship. Normally, we put in a lot more research into our vacations but honeymoon plans took a backseat to wedding plans this time. However, I have been on other major cruise lines before that weren't nearly as touristy.

It's a bit sad that you were disappointed so many times.  I've been reading reviews at ChowHound and you've definitely gotta avoid the touristy areas.  Small islands are tough b/c the only large inhabited areas are where the ports are so everything is Americanized.  You've really gotta explore and dig for the authentic stuff, but it's there!

Fil, it's hard on a cruise because you often only get 6 hours off the boat and you don't want to spend the bulk of that traveling. We know not to go on cruises through Europe anymore.

Athens, Greece
CONTENT
BreakfastWe went to the buffet for breakfast again, mostly the same old stuff so I didn't bother taking pictures. We had the lemon almond pastry today (they do seem to serve different flavors daily) which was very good.LunchThe ship parks in Piraeus so we had to take the train into Athens, where we walked around Plaka, an area known for shopping and flea markets, and looked up at the Acropolis. We were too lazy to walk to the top, which was under construction anyway. We tried to wander a bit away from the main tourist area to find food, which did end up being at least 30% cheaper than restaurants closer to Acropolis, but the food wasn't that great. The host at Ioakh Barbeque recommended the Leftiko, a braised lamb shank, which had little flavor and was unevenly heated, but the tomatoes were great.I was really looking forward to having Moussaka in Greece but this was a let down. The bechamel was over-cooked, a bit curdled actually, and the whole dish was rather dry.Post LunchLon and I love getting potato chips or snacks from different countries so we stopped into a small supermarket to get some goodies to bring home. We got Red Paprika, Olive Oil, and Bacon flavors.We saw so many street vendors selling rings of sesame bread. It seemed like a common local snack as people picked up one by the train station and ate while walking. We finally got one at a bread bakery called Neyka, where the friendly baker insisted on giving it to us for free. I thought they would be hard like bread sticks but it actually tasted like a cross between a sesame roll and a sesame bagel, with lots and lots of sesame. It was obviously made fresh just hours before.We walked through the National Park (with a little zoo), watched the changing of the guards, and headed back to Pireaus. On our walk back to the ship, we looked for some more snacks to bring back to the ship and Lon spotted some lamb heads on a spit.We ended up at Stamatis where Lon got a hot dog in an unsweetened donut dough. It wasn't that interesting, too much dough compared to hot dog, but the ham and cheese pastry was excellent. The dough was buttery and flaky. The filling included ham, cheese, a little oregano, and a dash of hot sauce, which resulted in a surprisingly mild flavor. It was a treat you wouldn't find in NY.I also got a great Frozen Chocolate Iced Coffee. I asked for it not-too-sweet and to my amazement, that's what I got.DinnerWe headed to the dining room a little before 7pm to avoid a wait. Lon started with a Crawfish Vol-Au-Vents, which was very good, flaky puff pastry with a flavorful crawfish filling. They seem to love serving crawfish on this ship.I started with the Pineapple with Strawberry Coconut Confit. Again, I hate the misuse of the word \"confit\", which refers to a slow cooking method (originally duck) of preserving something in its own fat. This dish was really just some beautifully cut pineapple (which was very good) and frozen strawberries defrosted with some coconut flakes sprinkled on top. Strawberry does not have fat so it can't be \"confit\".The Thai Chicken Soup was also a present surprise, nicely balanced between a litle tangy and a bit creamy, and very smooth.The entrees did not fair as well. Lon's Barbeque Salmon had a great flavor but it was a bit over-cooked. My Chateaubriand was over-cooked as well. Neither of us like the potatoes on our dishes either, Lon's was plain boiled potatoes, mine was dry potato croquette.Our waitress Yvette (the best one we've had so far) did notice that I didn't eat much of the beef. She asked if there was anything wrong and if she could replace it. I declined since I really wasn't hungry and the cut of meat was really not Chateaubriand, which they couldn't correct even if they could give me a piece that was medium-rare. (This picture makes the beef look more pink than it was.)The coffee ice cream was a standard ice cream and Lon's Chocolate Peanut Butter Pie was one of their least flavorful desserts so far, lacking mainly in peanut butter.Second DinnerThe buffet tonight was themed Madras Curry Buffet, which tempted us because we thought it had a shot of being better, considering the highly Asian staff in the kitchen. It was indeed a better buffet, with great curry shrimp, a pretty good curried fish, good lentils, and a decent rice. There were still some sad choices, chewy beef with potatoes, dry Tandoori Chicken, and hard breaded flat chicken.We're still eating too much dessert (it's terrible!), Cookies & Cream Cheesecake (missing the Oreos), Oatmeal Cookies, some other cake that we're not sure about. These weren't that good so luckily we didn't finish all of it.The day was full of hits and misses, overall not that exciting. So far Greece seems overly touristy. It's hard to get anything authentic. We're hoping for better in the next couple of stops. On to Mykonos next.

Anony, Thanks!  Trust us, we always look up definitions for clarity.  Wikipedia is not the best source for culinary terms.  While confit has taken on more uses (particularly in regard to fruit, the original use is for meats in their own fat).  Here is one definition that is narrower and from a culinary source, but we still find too broad.If you cook something in any fat, you're just poaching.

Katakolon, Greece
CONTENT
BreakfastWe had time for a leisurely breakfast in the dining room, which started with more donuts, still the best part of breakfast on the boat. I had a sugar donut, Lon had a chocolate almond pastry, and we shared a pretty good blueberry muffin. The Mushroom Fritatta was over-cooked, while the cheese on top was not even melted, but the sausage and polenta sides were better.Lon's pancakes were just good enough but the hash browns stole the show, crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, nice and hot, with lots of onion flavor.LunchKatakolon is a really small village, with only one main strip running maybe 4-5 blocks. We really didn't enjoy it since it was 4-5 blocks of pure tourist traps. Everything was over-priced, nothing seemed authentic, and other than water views, it wasn't at all interesting to look at. We started lunch at a table right by the water, ordering an Octopus cooked in red wine. We noticed that the menu stated a bread cover charge of 1.50 Euros per person. Crazy right? The octopus was tender but also stringy and the flavor was mediocre. The bread wasn't great either and this meal cost 17 Euros (20 Euros with tax, which is like $34) and it wasn't even a complete meal.We didn't have enough faith in the restaurant to order another dish so Lon decided he wanted to try Chicken Gyro Platter from a dive. It was pretty tasty since it was mostly chicken fat and skin with only a little bit of meat. The pita was soaked in oil, but at least the wonderful tomatoes and raw onions made it a little heathier. Thanks to this platter, I have a new favorite pairing, French Fries dipped in garlicky Tzaziki.Afternoon snackThere really wasn't anything else we could do in Katakolon, after walking up and down their one strip 3 or 4 times so we headed back to the ship for activities. First we hit the ping pong tables, then a little sun bathing (Lon also went into the pool), then we hit the buffet. As you can see, we're still eating more dessert than real food. The beef stuffed into the pita was tasty but chewy. Lon spent a minute trying to chew one mouthful and then apologized as he finally gave up and spit it out. The walnut cake was pretty good, light and not too sweet. The blueberry pie had a very hard crust, more like a cookie, and the filling was canned stuff. The cookies are ok.Pre-dinnerWe were obviously bored today. With nothing to do, we hit the pizza bar where I had one with mushrooms and prosciutto and Lon had two slices with pepperoni. Again, just ok but it's pizza.DinnerDinner was a similar experience to last night, pretty good compared to the first two nights, but a few problems still remained. We started with a seafood appetizer, chilled and fresh, but sitting in way too much mayo. I also had a vegetable minestrone which was ok.Lon's entree was Pappardelle with Rabbit ragout. The pasta and sauce, with bits of rabbit, was very good, but the slices of rabbit on top were severely over-cooked, tasting like dry pork.I had the Turbot Saltimboca, which was a bit over-cooked but still a pretty tender fish. I pulled of the prosciutto on top which was dry and chewy, but otherwise enjoyed the fish with the tomato sauce, nicely cooked plain broccoli, and al dente linguine in olive oil. The dish also gets points for being served piping hot.Before dessert, our waiter came by and attempted to sell us some limoncello and a souvenir glass. When he left, our table got into a conversation about how this cruise has been trying so hard to sell us stuff. It really annoyed us. Our table, full of frequent cruisers, had all noticed that there was an extra charge for things previous cruises had not charged extra for. I'm appalled that we have to pay for ice cream and toppings, soda, espressos and capuccinos. They try to sell you extra things every chance they get which makes me feel awkward. There is an air of desperation that makes me uncomfortable, like panhandlers in your face on the subway. It's such a constant bombardment when they call this an all-inclusive vacation.Lon was too full for dessert but I tried the Berry Sabayon Gratin. The crust-like top was chalky and just not attractive, but underneath the berries and sabayon were fine, although a bit sweeter than their other desserts.

If you guys were really interested in good food, then a cruise was the worst choice for a honeymoon. Especially on a mass-cruise line like Princess. For the kitchens, it's like feeding almost seven banquets three times a day.On one cruise, in the dining room, I was consistently served my hot foods cool, not hot; was served a partially baked, mostly raw, apple pie slice, and after several meals of this abuse, I went to the buffet for most meals. The food was like the average to below average Perkins or Denny's fare.So if you get any good food, consider it to be a bonus, not an expectation. That way you can enjoy yourselves rather than being grouchy for the whole trip.-Steve

I'm so sorry that your dining experiences have been less than satisfactory! The class I'm teaching has been researching global food prices however, and I can say that this might have been a bad time to eat cheap in Europe! You know, I actually think the more hoops you have to jump through on the wedding day and/or the honeymoon make the marriage stronger. It's the murphy's law way of saying it was meant to be. Think of it as accumulating good luck for years to come!

I always come back barely able to walk.Thanks Wonders!Steve R, you're right...it was something we thought about when we decided on the cruise but it was one of the only affordable ways to go to Europe right now when you factor in the US exchange rate.Thanks Dr. Food, I guess the over-cooked stuff will make us appreciate each others cookng that much more. =)

BreakfastWe went for the buffet for breakfast again since I wanted to hop off the boat as quickly as possible. There was a selection of sliced meats this time. I had some prosciutto and black forest ham, which were ok (I know I've been wearing out the word \"ok\", but that's really the best way to describe most of the food on this boat). I had some fruit and decided to call that breakfast. Lon had oatmeal and donuts.Pre-lunchIn Corfu, it's over a 2 mile walk to get to the historic district, where except for the church bells, it was pretty quiet because it was Sunday. We still managed a little shopping and picked up a circular spinach pastry that was out of this world. The phyllo was flaky yet not too oily. The outside lightly crunched while the inside layers were soft and buttery giving way to the soft filling of spinach, onion, and dill. The flavors were fresh and perfectly balanced. This is what I came to Greece for.LunchThe restaurant recommended by Chris, a local jeweler, provided a dream-like setting for al fresco dining, in the town center, covered in bright florals. Harris, Chris' silver-haired cousin, and owner took our order. We shared tzaziki, made with the creamiest yogurt, freshest cucumbers, and the most refreshing dill. The fresh garlic had bite without being harsh. The bread itself seemed ordinary but paired well with the tzaziki.The Sea Bass was supposedly pulled out of the water at 7am that morning and we believe it. You could taste how fresh it was and such fish needs only olive oil and a bit of seasoning. The potatoes were poached perfectly and flavored with, you guessed it, olive oil.The Shrimp Saganaki was perfectly tender shrimp, sitting in an amazing sauce. Think vodka sauce, but with the tang of feta, and some herbs to make it more refreshing.We loved this meal but it was extremely expensive (approx $70 lunch) and we were a bit annoyed that we were charged for the bread (4 Euros), an obvious tourist trap, which we did not order and figured it was complimentary like at any other restaurant.Afternoon SnackWe ate lunch really early so Lon was hungry when we got back on the ship. We had a little afternoon snack from the buffet, some beef tartare, steak, lamb ragout with penne, herbed french fries, mac & cheese, and fennel gratin. None were that interesting.DinnerDinner was better than usual on the boat tonight, still not exceptional but a bit better. We started with scallop ceviche which was overly peppery and the scallop muscles were left in, but still enjoyable and refreshing.I had a second appetizer, a simple salad with cherry tomatoes and yellow beets, but the ingredients were fresher this evening. Lon ordered two entrees and treated the Fetuccine Alfredo as an appetizer. The pasta was a little thick but still it was fresh pasta, with a nicely balanced sauce. The presentation, served in a parmesan bowl, was lovely, but it was too soft/chewy to eat.My entree was an Asian-style Duck Breast, which was over-cooked and a bit chewy, but the flavor was nice and not too sweet as I had expected. The portion was enormous.Lon had the Crawfish Etouffe, where the rice was under-cooked, but he really enjoyed the spicy and flavorful crawfish.Dessert was again, quite good. The Grand Marnier Souffle was more delicate than the Hazelnut souffle I had the night before -- good job! Lon's Raspberry and Hazelnut Soft Nougat was exactly what he was hoping for: not too sweet, plenty of flavor, and no hard nougat that would crush the cake. Unfortunately, it was served with a cool whip-like topping.As we ate dinner we discussed our shared hope for future meals to continue to improve like this. We wondered if Princess Cruise's strategy was to start off with mediocre food and end on a high note? We'll let you know.EveningWe packed in a full night: starting with another game show hosted by Assistant Cruise Director Martin. He seems consistently entertaining. Afterwards we considered taking a Salsa class, but instead opted for a late snack of fruit and desserts. We then headed off to a show all about shoes (this one was for Angie). Before the show started, I sipped a Cappuccino from the pay bar. It was ok, but I'll stick to buying my coffee off the boat.

Dubrovnik, Croatia

BreakfastWe woke up later than I had hoped but we really needed the sleep. We went to the Horizon Buffet for a quick breakfast where the offerings weren't that enticing. Lon picked up some pates from a large selection but didn't really enjoy them. The rest was pretty standard buffet stuff, bacon, scrambled eggs, bread. (Not posting pics of this due to bad bandwidth. Only posting best ones.)Again, the donut (this one was like a fresh zeppole) ended up being the favorite for both of us. It's going to be really bad if their donuts are their best item. By day 12, I may be ten pounds heavier. The Eggs Benedict was over-cooked and their was a layer of fake American cheese on top, yuck. The strawberries looked pretty but were a bit sour.I asked for an egg white omelet with cheese, onions, mushrooms, and tomato. It was just ok but by now I'm not expecting much anymore. I'll just have to get good food off the boat.Internet Cafe StopWe stopped at an internet cafe and ordered some drinks. The funny thing is that they came with branded glasses. My Jamnica sparkling water was poured into a Jamnica glass and Lon's Orangina came with an Orangina glass. And I thought America was the land of branding.Casa CroaticaWe happened upon a little shop of olive oils, vinegars, and a few sweets. We sampled the various olive oils and chose a bottle to bring home.Lunch at KonobaDubrovnik is a coastal town so of course we had seafood. The Grilled Squid were SO amazing!! Lon and I couldn't stop gushing over the flavors. It was so simple, just perfectly grilled and sitting in olive oil, garlic, a little lemon and parsley. The secret is that the squid itself is bursting with flavor, in a way no squid does in New York.The Seafood Risotto, or what they call risotto, is actually more soupy. I enjoyed it because of the intense seafood tomato broth but Lon wasn't as happy with it. The shell-on shrimp were a bit over-cooked but I was still in love. We ate tons of bread too, which was spongey and perfect for soaking up the olive oil and drippings from the squid.On top of the best meal we've had so far, the view was amazing. We sat in the open air, looking at water, the boats, and the mountains. The honeymoon was starting to feel a lot more romantic.After lunch, we later stumbled across a cliffside bar which was just breathtaking. It looked like something out of a movie, different levels of flat ground placed into the rocks, each barely large enough to hold a table and a few chairs, where people chat and drank, looking out into the water.Dinner Back on the boat, we did a little sunbathing on the deck as our ship pulled out of port. We found out that Caribe Cafe was supposed to be a premium buffet as opposed to Horizon, the regular one. We were pretty disappointed to find that it was just as sad looking. The prosciutto was really salty, without real flavor. The mozzarella was presented nicely but tasted so odd. It tasted like lettuce, possibly from sitting on the lettuce, it had apparently absorbed that flavor. The lasagna was edible, the gnocchi was almost edible, and the shrimp was over-cooked, which you could have guessed since it's sitting on a buffet. The zucchini was bitter and this looks like a sad dinner doesn't it?Again, dessert did a lot better, and again, this is going to be a problem. We ended up eating more espresso cheesecake, Tiramisu, and Frutti di Bosco than any real dinner food.We were still hungry so Lon grabbed a cheeseburger from the Trident Grill. It was sustenance. I waited till a little later and just had some fruit and cheese. Ehh...just barely acceptable but I was satiated, although not mentally satisfied.

becauseseems like you guys are having a great honeymoon - the cruise sounds great. Croatia would be buzzing with soccer fever too and I am sure the sliced duck was the harbinger of better food. The cruise food seemed better from your descriptions. The airline food looks fetid...what's wrong with these guys!!!

A Day at Sea
CONTENT
BreakfastWe chose to browse the Horizon Buffet for breakfast. Lon was very happy with the wide array of smoked fish, Mahi Mahi, swordfish, whitefish, and more (at least 7 types). I thought most were either too chewy or two salty but did finish my slice of smoked salmon.Lon also enjoyed the squid ball soup, which was indeed good and unique.The French toast and bread pudding were both pretty good, not great, but I was happily surprised to see perfectly cooked over-easy eggs.The papaya was presented so nicely but the fruit was not yet ripe enough. Surprisingly, the cream filled donut is the best thing I’ve eaten on this boat so far, so fresh, I know it was just fried and filled, and it wasn’t too sweet. Hooray!After breakfast, we saw a quick fruit/vegetable carving demo. Well it wasn't really a demo, more just quick assembly of already carved pieces.Lunch Lunch was a series of unorganized wondering around and picking up food. We hit the pizza bar first where I was actually impressed. It wasn't great but it was the closest to New York style pizza I’ve ever had outside of NY. Lon didn’t like the cheese but I've had much much worse.I continued walking and eating to accompany Lon to the buffet. Unfortunately, we didn’t find anything good. We didn’t even see much that looked enticing. It was just a sad looking buffet. We reluctantly chose a few things to try and the Mozzarella En Corozza was over-battered and dry. There was also some weird fish in it.The fresh mozzarella was probably the best thing on the buffet but the sliced tomatoes were flavorless. The pureed vegetable soup with white beans were ok, as was the corned beef brisket, but lunch was still looking bleak.We decided to give it one more try at the Trident Grill where burgers, dogs, and such are served poolside. The chicken sandwich was dry. The Veal bratwurst was pretty good, although we both think it tasted more like pork than veal. The fries were decent.Lunch was over and remained a sad memory.Afternoon Tea I had expected some nice teas but only a plain Lipton-like tea was offered. Trays of pastries and finger sandwiches were carried around by servers. We sampled nearly every pastry since Lon was still hungry from his unsatisfied lunch and the waiter didn’t seem to know what they were. Overall, the scones and pastries were mediocre in taste, but a step up in presentation. The chocolate filled cream puff was my favorite.The finger sandwiches had hit or misses, the ham and cheese mini croissant being the best, the salami sandwiches and vegetable sandwiches were hard. At least we had some good table company, even though the chances are slim to be sitting with people near our age.Dinner We sat with three other couples in the Da Vinci dining room, exactly like the Michelangelo dining room, which we ate in the previous evening. They have the same menu too. You have to share a table unless you want to be waiting for 30 minutes to be seated.I started with a duck appetizer, thinly and evenly sliced, perfect with a touch of cranberry sauce. It’s definitely the best savory dish I’ve had so far.Lon’s crab quiche was just acceptable, as the majority of the food is.Both of us chose the Filet Mignon for dinner since not much else grabbed our attention. While the demi-glace was very well balanced, our steaks (ordered medium rare) came medium/ medium-well, which pretty much destroyed our entrée. In most instances, Lon and I would have sent the steak back (as you’ve witnessed before) but the service of the dinner had dragged on for so long already, we were afraid we would never make it to another activity. The potato croquettes were also dry and unappetizing anyway so I chalked this up to a loss.Luckily, desserts saved reputations a little bit. I was expecting a fake soufflé but the Hazelnut Souffle was actually quite good. It wasn’t perfect because it shou ld be lighter, more delicate, but it was certainly made fresh and very enjoyable. Lon’s dessert was a simple heart shaped chocolate ganache.Through our conversations with our dinner companions, I had expressed some dissatisfaction over the food on board so far. In comparison to the previous cruises I’ve been on, the food isn’t as good, especially at the buffet. My previous experiences (2 cruises in Hawaii and 1 in the Carribean) included really impressive and expansive looking buffets that always had a wow factor. I had told Lon all about ice carvings, fruit and vegetable carvings, way more variety and I felt I had let him down. It seemed that our table was full of frequent cruisers who pointed out that they too noticed better food on some of the smaller ships. Who knew? Most of the research I read pointed to bigger ships being better but in general I do have to say that I’m disappointed in the food so far.To end things worse, we weren’t completely full after dinner so after some comedy and acrobatics show, we went back to look for food. Unfortunately, the late night snack buffet is just a lay-out of left-overs from the day, being picked over by hungry crew members. It was very sad looking and nothing like my past experiences.

Thanks re: the pics!  We're sure it has to do with the plentiful sun.  We've been taking most of the pics on ISO 100 or 200, which results in far less grain and smooth edges.  Also, we haven't had to use any flash yet, even in the dining room.  And many of the pics are at a nice tight f-stop.Some of the pics are on our new point-and-click, the Casio Exilim EX-S10A (thanks Bobby!!)

Venice
CONTENT
2008-06-07: Updated to include images.We arrived in Venice and shuffled off to our ship, the Princess Emerald, where like we mentioned, we spent a ridiculous amount of time trying to get wireless service to our laptop. By the time we were done calling our travel agency at American Express, we were starving and rushed off to find a dining room. Luckily, we were seated quickly. We were both in a bad mood, deeply regretting our decision to book our honeymoon through TheBigDay.com. (BTW, I just paid over $50 just to post the last two posts because of the spotty service, and I can't even get more than 1 picture to load right now because of how bad the internet is here.)The first thing I noticed was that their menu included many \"lotus spa\" healthy choices. It's nice to know you can attempt to stay healthy on a cruise. Yet, I chose the Seafood Terrine to start, not one of those \"healthy items\". It was presented nicely and pretty good for a seafood terrine, which is actually not something I usually like. I generally don't believe in ground seafood but this was a nice and light slice, with a suitable tartar-like sauce.Lon chose the shrimp cocktail, labeled as Tiger Shrimp on the menu. It was nice and fresh but not Tiger shrimp and it's such a peeve of ours that people don't take menu writing seriously. These are not marketing catch phrases, Tiger Shrimp, Lump Crab Meat, Confit... these words have specific meanings and are not equal to saying large, good, or great.My main course, Barramundi, was a generous portion in a lovely presentation and the couscous was a nice pairing. The fish was slightly over-cooked but still enjoyable.Lon's Creole Crockpot was another nice presentation, unfortunately the top crust did not add otherwise. Once removed by the waiter and placed aside, it was useless as it was quite flavorless. The seafood inside gets points for being extra hot and certainly enjoyable. The flavors were surprisingly basic, tomato, peppers, onions, nothing more exotic than children's food but Lon was fine with it. I think his mind was set on getting off the boat for a quick tour of Venice.Lon was determined to have me try gelati, and until I tried it, I have to admit, I didn't think it could be THAT much better, but it was. We walked by a random gelati vendor called Polo Nord and each ordered two flavors.Lon had a come with strawberry and melon, both creamy and ultra fruity.I had the chocolate hazelnut and yogurt with berries (which you can't see because it was beneath). Both were amazing, exhibiting more flavor than I've ever noticed in gelati, ice cream, or related. The use of real hazelnut is evident and to everyone eating Pinkberry, you are really missing something when you don't have the fat! The mouth feel is a whole new world.Upon our return to the boat, we stumbled onto a buffet (available till 11pm) where I loaded a plate with lobster claws, crab legs, and cocktail shrimp. We sat under the stars listening to a broadcast of Pavaratti, munching away on shellfish. Ahh....

Airplane and Airport Food
CONTENT
I don’t ever expect airplane food to be good so Lufthansa gave me what I expected. I chose the pasta (with canned mushrooms) which was terribly over-cooked. The bread was cold from sitting in the fridge, the cheese was bland, but the fruit was pretty good. The brownie was also edible, not too sweet.The veggies looked so sad and they were served with dressing as if to say, this is a salad. Not!Lon had the chicken which was covered in an overly sweet fruit sauce, but the corn was fine.I really don’t expect the food to be good but my main complaint is that the meal is served at a time that doesn’t make sense for either time zone, roughly midnight New York time and 6 am Frankfurt time. Closer to the end of the flight, a snack is served, which I appreciated for the fruit. The bread was ok and I didn’t eat the rest.With nothing to do but eat during our 3 hour lay-over in Frankfurt, we started with a café au lait and pretzel with cheese and bacon. When we were in Germany 2 years ago, the pretzels were amazing. This one did not live up to our memory and wasn’t heated enough. The café au lait only just satisfied.We moved on to frankfurters, which had an amazing audible snap when you took a bite. The bread was an embarrassment to the sausages that put US versions to shame.The Bombay sandwich was slightly too wet bit a nice light flavor combination of chicken and curry mango dressing.We're ready for the real food!

We had some bad airplane food (on Luftansa), after being delayed over an hour for take-off. We've finally arrived at our ship - Princess Emerald, leaving from the port in Venice, and we're having issues getting internet access. We were lead to believe that wireless would be free although spotty, but we are now being told it will cost 75 cents per minute (some packages available). We hope to have this resolved as we have just spent time that should have been enjoying Venice, on trying to get wireless access. We hope to be getting food reviews and photos up for you soon. Sorry for the delay.

Pizza Paradise
CONTENT
We noticed another pizza joint in our hood so we had to try it. Pizza Paradise Pizza Paradise is not a fancy brick oven place. It's what pizza joints looked like when I was in High School, over ten years ago. That's what the pizza tastes like too, back when most pizza places were very similar. To me that means the pizza is pretty good, but not as good as the newer thin crusts, which I prefer. The crust, sauce, and cheese are all good but not great, but certainly cheaper than the new fancy places. The large pie, half plain, half chicken cutlet (generous amount), was only $18. Free delivery.

La Paella
CONTENT
For Olivia's birthday, we gathered for dinner at La Paella La Paella, a tapas restaurant where the waitress recommends skipping Paella and sticking to the little plates. I'd hate to taste their Paella then, considering none of the tapas surpassed mediocre for me. Actually, I think this is the most consistently mediocre restaurant I've ever been to. All but one dish, the scallops which had a nasty, almost metallic taste, was mediocre, made with mediocre ingredients, executed with middle of the road skill, presented in a mediocre way.Boring potatoes, tasted boiled and then sauced.Dry (which you can actually see in the picture) Meatballs in red sauce.Stuffed Squid with no defining flavors.Poorly sliced Serrano that didn't have much flavor.The simple Bruschetta Toasts might have been slightly better than the rest but who can't make this?Decent clams but not memorable.The Mixed Platter looked like a plate someone helped themselves to at a buffet. The omelet was a little tough. The skewer was so-so. The fried asparagus tasted like anything battered and fried. The Manchego was ultra mild (read flavorless) and serving roasted peppers out of a jar is embarrassing. What was supposed to be ceviche, was really just a cooked squid salad, like one from any deli.Roasted Peppers Stuffed with Goat Cheese didn't really taste like goat cheese.The octopus was just another dish, boiled and sauced.The shrimp was just slightly over-cooked and not flavored at all. Just a little sea salt and herbs could have helped.I won't be offended if you're bored by this post. This restaurant inspires yawning. For the same prices, you'll be better off at Pipa or Sala One Nine for tapas.

Wow that pretty much sucked! I'd be upset if every dish I ordered was bad. I've eaten at Sala One Nine once, but we had dinner and not tapas, it was pretty good but too dark inside lols My gf laughed at me when I told her I've never had tapas before.... -=(

That's too bad.  Why would the waitress tell you NOT to get the paella?  I've been to La Paella a few times (some years ago) and always thought the paella was pretty good.  I agree that the tapas aren't so great.  Well, there's better tapas places in the city:  Casa Mono, Tia Pol, Solera...

Carnation Bakery
CONTENT
There's so many Chinese bakeries these days, it's hard to know which ones to go to. For that, I have my mom, who always knows what's good in the realm of Chinese foods, especially in Queens. After brunch on Monday, my mom drove us to Carnation Bakery Carnation Bakery, one of our favorites. It is out of the way, and not within walking distance of a train station but if you have a car, you might want to head out there.Their bakery buns are so popular that they are being freshly baked continuously. You can see and smell the great stuff coming out of their ovens at any time you go. They're also a bit larger than the average bun and not any more expensive.One of my favorites is the Ruosong Bun. The pork floss is encased in soft and doughy bread, with a lightly buttery and flaky top.Lon loves the hot dog buns. The soft and elastic bun around the hot dog is way better than the average hot dog bun.A new version with scallions is even better!The croissant looked so good but I didn't like it that much. Stick to the Chinese stuff. We tried not to buy too many but some of my other favorites are their Coconut Bun and their Red Bean Bun!If you haven't gone to a Chinese Bakery yet, you're truly missing a whole subset of food. Mmmm.....Chinese Bakery Buns.

Rehearsal Dinner at Dong Yi Feng
CONTENT
Our rehearsal dinner was at Dong Yi Feng Dong Yi Feng, a Chinese banquet style meal of ten courses, for each of our five tables, seating ten people each. With all the excitement, I forgot to take pictures of a few dishes. I'm sure you can understand. The first course was a really unique chopped clam dish served in lettuce wraps and hoisin sauce. I heard several people saying something like, this is good, what is it? haha. Next was one of Lon's favorites, Fried Jumbo Shrimp covered in a Mayo Sauce with Candied Walnuts. The snap of these over-sized shrimp excited me, while Lon was fascinated with the Fried Milk, these cripsy little nuggets with creamy centers.The soup...imagine egg drop with pieces of beef and lots of cilantro.At a Chinese banquet, fresh killed fish, meaning just pulled out of the tank and prepared, is very important. These were steamed with scallions and ginger with just a drop of soy sauce. Simple preparations are best for such fresh fish.One of my favorite dishes since childhood has been Tender Veal with Chinese Broccoli, and it seems to have done well with Lon's groomsmen.The Lobster in Black Bean Sauce was of course a hit, so perfectly cooked.Crispy Skin Chicken is really a specialty of Cantonese restaurants. To get such juicy meat and such crispy is a difficult day long process.Gotta have your veggies so why not have the best. I love snow pea shoots. They have the flavor of snow peas but come in the form of tender leafy greens.I forgot to take pictures of the last two dishes. By now I was very full and making my rounds around the tables to talk to people. I did get a bite of the fried rice with chicken and salted fish, but never came close to the vegetarian noodles since I was off taking a picture with everyone.The day after the wedding, we had a dim sum brunch at Jade Asian Restaurant before seeing some of our out-of-town guests off. Sorry no pics, I think I was still half asleep. That didn't stop my mom from challenging my table (filled with our age group) to a challenge against her table (of her age group) to see who could eat more. Their table won but in all fairness, we had less people at our table. The third table ate the least. That's you Kasi & Stephen!We'll get food pics from the wedding up in a week or two.

Obviously, Lon and I are obsessed with food. At our wedding, we named each table with an herb or spice and the appropriate sign was made:Then each guest would find their seating card, which was actually attached to a pouch filled with the herb or spice of their table.Ooh, it smelled so good, a table filled with red pepper flakes, different colored peppercorns, parsley, ginger, turmeric, basil, thyme, nutmeg, star anise, cinnamon, cayenne, cumin, paprika, oregano, coriander, bay leaves, fennel seed, allspice, dill, annatto, rosemary, and cloves.We hope everyone had a great time!

Rice Works

We were in the May 19, 2008 issue of People Magazine and I didn't want to post anything until the wedding because then my guests would see the bridesmaids dresses. In any case, the photo shoot was fun and our super nice photographer, John Clark, supplied us with snacks. We all went crazy over the Rice Works Gourmet Brown Rice Crisps. The Sweet Chili flavor totally rocked!!We took some great photos of the girls pigging out on them. It almost looks like a commercial. Hint Hint, if Rice Works would like to buy these photos, we're negotiable.These delicious healthy versions of Dorritos do come at a price though, around $4 for one of those bags. Target will be selling them as of June 6th so I'm hoping it'll be cheaper there and I'll just stock up once in a while.

Yogurtland
CONTENT
My friend Lily told me that she passed by a place with yogurt for 39 cents per ounce. I told Lon about it and he didn't believe me. I realized that we were just a few steps away from it at Fish, so I went looking for the place after dinner, and there was Yogurtland Yogurtland. With several locations in California, this marks the first spot in New York and we welcome them.The wall of self-serve yogurt machines is impressive, with way more flavors than Pinkberry, Red Mango, and Flurt. There's mango, blueberry, strawberry, taro, green tea, cookies and cream, capuccino, and more. The capuccino, and cookies and cream flavors were just ok. I prefer these kinds of flavors in ice cream but the fruity flavors were quite good, blueberry being the clear winner.The variety of toppings is also impressive with all the standards plus things like mochi, cheesecake, and red beans.The best part is that you can have whatever you want in whatever quantity and just pay 39 cents per ounce. My yogurt came out to $2.17, an amount that would easily be $4 or more in the other yogurt places (which I consider rip offs). Keep in mind that the cup is really big. We are thinking the price will go up so try to hit them soon!I realized after leaving that I didn't try the plain, in order to do a comparison between Yogurtland and the other places, but I was overwhelmed with sampling all the flavors. BTW, they do let you sample before buying. I'll have to go back to do a more thorough evaluation but for now, it's worth trying for anyone since it's so cheap, and definitely have the blueberry flavor.

Fish
CONTENT
Fish Fish is a no frills seafood bar that seems to know what they specialize in, at the detriment of almost everything else. The raw platter was filled with wonderfully fresh oysters, meaty Fanny Bay's, delicate Kumamotos, sweet Blue Points, and some others, which I can't remember the names of. One tasted like an oyster shot. Yum! The mignonette and cocktail sauce were just passable and the mayo (with some soy in it?) was just weird.My mom ordered Steamers, prepared with beer and jalapenos, the best preparation I've ever had for steamers. I'm going to have to try this at home!My simple grilled Wild Salmon was cooked perfectly.Lon's catfish was tender. So, it seems like a great place, right? Unfortunately, fish and shellfish is where it ends, all the side items are terrible. The hush puppies tasted like dry cornbread fried. The collard greens were rough and sour.The gumbo didn't come close to resembling a gumbo, just murky green liquid with random chunks of stuff, no defining flavors.While I truly enjoyed the oysters and the steamers, I'm doubting my return. I tend to like balanced meals with protein, carbs, and veggies, and here I could only eat protein. Oddly, it seems they've got the hard stuff down and can't figure out a few decent sides. Just outsource if you have to.

Wallaby Organic Yogurt
CONTENT
I was replenishing my stock of Fage 2% (Greek strained yogurt) today and noticed Wallaby Organic Yogurt on sale. There's so many new yogurts around, a good thing since our standard American brands don't cut it for me, and since I tried Siggi's Skyr (Icelandic style yogurt) last time, I figured I should give this Australian style yogurt a try as well.I bought 4 flavors from their Organic lowfat line (I'm not into nonfat yogurt, you just need a little fat) and they were delicious. The flavors were very natural, which makes sense if you look at the clean ingredient list, and of course, organic is a plus. These yogurts are not as thick as Fage but certainly creamy with great mouth feel. They are less filling so they work as quick and healthy snacks. I do whole heartedly recommend them, at least the two flavors I've tried so far, Blueberry (like a smoothie) and Banana Vanilla (nice and light).

I'm always so jealous of your yogurt postings. We only have American yogurt here. Every time I make tzatziki I think of Greek yogurt. Have you ever had Nancy's yogurt? It's the only kind I like around here (Oregon company), and the honey yogurt is actually pretty darn good.
MJ
2008-05-31 00:21:00
For Dr. Food...see if you can find Stonyfield Farm organic plain yogurt. While it isn't quite as thick as Greek yogurt it has the same tart flavor and is much thicker and richer than the watery stuff that passes as "yogurt" in most of the US. And I can find it in the grocery store in Mississippi, so I'm imagining it's pretty widely available.
EMC
2008-05-31 01:02:00
MJ-You're right! I forgot to mention my other favorite! Stonyfield is great stuff, and doesn't taste anything like the generic Dannon type I'm used to seeing so regularly! Thanks!

Dr. Food, I haven't seen Nancy's but I'll look for it next time. It may be worth shipping yourself a case of Fage Greek yogurt. It lasts for a good amount of time.mj, thanks for visiting! I use the plain Stonyfield for baking sometimes.

McDonalds Southern-Style Chicken Sandwich
CONTENT
You may recall the other day I mentioned trying McDonald's new breakfast sandwich, the chicken biscuit; well, even if you don't my stomach did. While I wasn't a fan, it seems you were, because we got a ton of reader interest about the review; so I sacrificed my bowels via a second trip to McD's for the lunch-version.See the image to the right? That is the product image. And for once, the real thing looked exactly like the published product image. Unfortunately, that was not a good thing since literally this is basically a huge chicken nugget on dry white bread with two pickle slices. No mayo, no ketchup, no lettuce, zilch. While I do enjoy a chicken nugget on some white bread, I have to say this was pretty sad. So skip it.Similar to my last visit, the store was simply chaotic. But as usual, McDonald's is trialing some new technology to improve through-put, and I was impressed. A woman was working her way up and down the lines of people with a handheld, wireless device to take orders. She used it to take my order, by the time I got to the register I simply had to pay. It looked like there were kinks to be hammered out, such as getting the food out more quickly, but I like the system in general.

well, it pretty much is a close duplicate of the Chick-fil-a chicken sandwich with a slightly different roll. if you compare the seasonings of the 2 competing sandwiches, they are very similar:) mcdonald's = food whore.

Duck Fat Turkey Meatballs
CONTENT
After roasting that duck the other night, we were left with excess duck fat, which we of course saved. I decided to make turkey meatballs, fried in the duck fat, for a nice twist. You won't really taste definable duck fat, but I do think it adds to the flavor of this dish. On a separate note, I usually brunois carrots for my red sauces, because carrots add a natural sweetness. I was feeling lazy today so I decided to try shredding the carrots on a box grater and the result was great. I may end up doing it the lazy way more often.Frying in duck fat....Very tender Duck Fat Turkey Meatballs with thin spaghetti.Duck Fat Turkey MeatballsSauceMeatballs1. Heat oil in a large pot at medium high heat.2. Add onions and saute for 2 minutes, stirring occasionally.3. Add carrots and celery and saute until soft, about 3 minutes.4. Add diced tomatoes and crushed tomatoes and bring to a boil.5. Add garlic and bay leaves. Cover and let it simmer for 1 hour before you pan fry the meatballs. You should prepare the meatballs and cook your pasta during this time.6. In a large bowl, combine ground turkey, egg, onion, roasted red peppers, bread crumbs, herbs, salt and pepper. Mix until even. Form into 1.5 inch balls. ( You should get about 25 of them.)7. Heat duck fat in a shallow but large pan. Brown the meatballs lightly on all sides and throw them directly into the pot of sauce.8. Simmer sauce with meatballs for 25 more minutes before serving. Remove bay leaves.9. Serve with pasta of choice.Remember to enjoy the wonderful aroma while you cook!

Since my husband hates carrots, I stopped putting the effort into chopping the carrots and celery so tiny for my red sauces; I cut into big chunks and use an immersion blender afterwards. I lose the texture, but I snuck in the veggies and all the flavor it adds.I make a similar recipe, but use bacon bits and leftover bacon grease. I'll try the duck fat next time!

Al Forno
CONTENT
We ordered from Al Forno Al Forno while we were at Kasi and Stephen's this weekend and the pizza was good enough to satisfy my pizza craving but not good enough to cause a pizza craving. The main problem being the tasteless mozzarella they use. The sauce is pretty good and the crust is fantastic in spots, both chewy and crispy, but inconsistent, so there are also soggy areas. We ordered one with sausage (nice flavorful crumbles) and anchovies, one plain, and one white pie. The ricotta was actually quite good but couldn't save the mozzarella, again bland, and rubbery once it cools a bit. The cheese is ultimately too important for me to go again. Oh well, there seems to be more pizza places than ever these days...on to the next.

Sushi Yasuda #12 - Copper River Salmon
CONTENT
As I mentioned in my last post on Sushi Yasuda, Copper River Salmon is now available! What's better than Copper River Salmon? Two types of Copper River Salmon, both shockingly bright orange. On the left is the King Salmon, slightly softer than the Sockeye Salmon on the right. The flavor of both is wonderful yet subtle, so subtle that I think they would be better as sashimi. (note to self)The very strong salmon flavor in this Sockeye Salmon Roll really shines here, exhibiting a pungency the other salmons don't seem to have.The Wild Salmon Roe (also from the Copper River) are smaller than the usual salmon roe, softer, smoother in flavor, like it was purified. I'm imagining that the water in the Copper River must be very clean.I'm so glad I got to eat Copper River Salmon at least once this year cause we just called a few other restaurants and can't seem to find anyone else serving it (possibly because it's very expensive this year due to lower inventory). Thanks again Sushi Yasuda!

I just had some very fresh Copper River Salmon sashimi on Saturday-Chef Inoue (ie. my hero) drove all the way to Seattle and back Friday night/Saturday morning and prepared the best salmon I've tasted in a long time. You're right on the subtleness but for some reason it tasted like butter. Sooooo worth the wait.

Oh yeah and I meant to mention that you're right about the Copper River being very clean. Some of my students have been interns and hired help in the conservation programs in Alaska, and I've read countless papers on the benefits of a self-sustaining massive delta ecosystem. 2 million salmon spawn on the CR a year, and they are some of the most coveted fishy treasures in the world.

Secret Empanadas at Universal News
CONTENT
The other day, we stopped in at the Universal News on 14th Street Universal News, to buy drinks. I always go there for Vitamin Water since they sell them ice cold for $1.50, which is the cheapest I've found, sold retail, without a special sale. This magazine store is part of a chain of 10 locations in Manhattan but they all look and feel a bit different. I wasn't even sure they were related until I looked it up. Oddly, the one by us sells a few snack foods, including beef and chicken empanadas. We tried the beef one and they weren't the best ever but ten times better than the ones we bought at the street fair, and this one was only $1.50. It was actually flavorful, although too salty, and it tasted like real food inside. It had easily twice the amount of filling, and two could easily be called lunch. You can't find lunch for $3 that easily, at least not by 14th Street. I'm not usually so drawn to cheap eats almost purely by the value factor, notice me not impressed by the 99 cent pizza, but these kind of got me, I'm going to have to try the chicken one and see what else they offer.On a side note, Lon once bought a sandwich from the Universal News on 23rd Street Universal News and said it was disgusting.

Roasted Duck with Cherry Balsamic Glaze
CONTENT
Mmmm....duck, another meal I should not have made right before the wedding. It's just so delicious though. I also find that whole duck is often over-cooked, or I just prefer under-cooked, whichever way you want to look at it but I don't like dry meat. This preparation yields a very moist little duck, and it's relatively easy for such an impressive looking dinner. It's perfect for a romantic dinner for two if you've been dating long enough not to care about being a little messy.Before going in the oven...Just out of the oven.....beautiful color.Cut and served with roasted veggies piled on!Roasted Duck with Cherry Balsamic GlazePreheat oven to 400 degrees if using convection, 425 without convection.1. Line the roasting pan with celery, carrots, and onions, beneath the rack.2. Cut excess fat off the duck and pierce the skin of the duck with a fork in several spots and lay on the rack breast side up.3. Mix aged cherry balsamic, mustard, and garlic together and brush onto duck.4. Pull thyme leaves off the stems and sprinkle on the outside of the duck. Tuck the stems into the cavity. Sprinkle the inside and outside with salt and pepper.5. Place the star anise on the inside of the cavity.6. Roast for 20 minutes and turn the duck over so that breast side is down. Baste with more cherry balsamic mixture and place it back in the oven for another 10 minutes.7. Turn the duck over again, now breast side up, baste again, and roast another 5 minutes or until the internal temperature is 160 degrees. You may need to cover the legs with aluminum foil so they don't burn.8. Rest for another 5 minutes before serving.notes:~If the duck neck was included, throw it in the roasting pan, basted and seasoned. It'll be done after 20 minutes, so you can have a snack while you're waiting for your duck. The neck is one of my favorite parts!!~The roasted vegetables on the bottom don't look that pretty but they are delicious, trust me, caramelized vegetable candy! Make sure to strain off as much fat as possible, otherwise they will taste oily.~I served it with some left-over cous cous and super fresh broccoli rabe that I bought at the farmer's market on Saturday. Fantastic!

Deep River Snacks - Sweet Maui Onion Potato Chips
CONTENT
I picked up a bag of Sweet Maui Onion Potato Chips (made by Deep River Snacks) with lunch and we really liked them. They were reminiscent of Funyuns, which we both apparently ate as kids, but better, since we like the texture of kettle cooked potato chips more. The fancy name really just means sugar, salt, and onion powder, but in the right balance, it's quite addictive.

Beyond the Sweet Maui Onion, I dig the Creamy Cucumber, which tastes somewhat like a sophisticated sour cream and onion.http://www.timschips.com/mm5/merchant.mvc?Screen=ORPRO

Street Fair Food
CONTENT
Street Fair Food has really deteriorated in the last 10 years and it's become much more expensive. These days, it's horrible bubble tea, dry shish kebabs and over-cooked chicken, cold falafels, bland Thai food, not-so-delicate crepes, and greasy Cuban or Dominican, repeated street after street. I rarely see the giant smoked turkey legs anymore, and the zeppole stands are fewer as well. The larger problem is that these stands are so expensive, often costing more than a random restaurant you could find a block away.Yesterday, we walked down the street fair on 3rd Ave, running below 14th Street to about 7th Street, and for some reason, we were still drawn to buying the food we knew would disappoint. The only one I can condone buying is the arepas because it's not widely available. The concept of cheese sandwiched between sweet corn cakes, sizzling in butter, is just fantastic, but $4! It's made of cheap stuff. Besides, if I were to make it myself, I would definitely use a stronger cheese and more of it.Then Lon, being drawn to all things fried, picked up chicken and beef empanadas to share with my cousin Olivia, who hadn't eaten lunch yet. They were so-so; I don't like fried things cold and the chicken one was made with white meat, which means dry. The pair cost $5 which is not that much until you realize that it's just egg roll wrapper and the same thing, made better, served hot, cost $1.99 at Sophie's Cuban Restaurant.Then, we picked up dumplings from a Thai stand, $3 for 4 pieces. That is way too expensive and to top it off the two chicken dumplings were terribly dry (the pork were ok).I thought we finally found something good when we saw \"Authentic Pit Southern Style Barbecue\" and a few people were standing on line. We chose a pulled pork sandwich to share, and it was a decent portion for the price, $6. The pork was very dry though, and shredded into tiny bits, leaving little texture. Luckily the sauce was left on the side for you to add as needed, which for us was three or four times.I was happy to see the end of the street fair, so I couldn't be pulled into buying more food that wasn't worth the money or the calories.

College Eats
CONTENT
When I first moved out from my mom's house I was about 17 and getting ready to start college. It was my first time paying rent and I was hungry! Health or weight were not factors in my diet, just quantity and price (read: cheap). Ease of cooking and flavor were secondary factors. You had better believe carbs were a huge component of dishes, particularly Top Ramen, when those things were on sale for five or more for a dollar, my pantry was stocked up. So today, this is a round up of some of the easy and fast dishes from my college daze. The ratings are out of five points where 5 is the best.Dish #1 - Ramen Noodles with ElbowsNever a big fan of ramen soup, I usually made them as just dry noodles with the seasoning packet. But I found the best way to extend the meal was to add in boxed pasta, typically elbows. So the quick recipe: start boiling a bunch of elbows first, then add in the ramen (I always used \"Oriental Flavor\"), broken up. Make sure to follow the timing on the box, so if the elbows take 8 minutes and the ramen taken 5 minutes, give the elbows a three minute head start. Then quickly strain all the pasta and place into a bowl (leave the noodles nice and wet) and cover with the seasoning packet and toss. Eat as straight, salty noodles. Yum! Hint: I found the seasoning coated more uniformly by putting half of the seasoning in the bowl before adding the noodles.Dish #2 - Tuna w/ Canned Something ElseTuna was cheap, again when on sale for a few cans per dollar, my pantry was stocked up. Even today, I usually keep too much on hand (it's a hold-over). I usually make tuna by using one can of white tuna and one can of \"light\" (a.k.a. the dark meat), straining the liquid out of the cans and dumping in a bowl. I add plenty of mayo and whatever spices I have handy (garlic, mustard powder, salt, pepper, onion powder, cayenne, etc.). That alone is fine on toast or a roll, and if you want to get fancy, add a leaf of lettuce. But when I wanted to mix things up, I grabbed another can of, oh, anything, and threw it in. You'd be surprised how well this can work out. Some of the items that I liked were: black olives, corn, jalapeños, beans, or artichokes.Dish #3 - Grilled Chicken Breast on RiceThis was the most complex dish I made back then. It actually used a pot AND a pan! I would buy chicken breast or thighs and try to get them thin, either by hitting them with whatever I had handy or by trying to slice them thinner, which when I used my crappy $2 knife left me with chicken rags. Fortunately they still tasted good. I coated aggressively in kosher salt and black pepper, and garlic powder if I had it handy, then cooked in a grill pan (sprayed with PAM, if it was around). I just cooked it until it was crispy and brown. These days I'd consider that over-cooked, but it was just fine back then. Meanwhile, I would steam white rice in a pot. The technique I used was: a handful of dry rice, in a pot, covered with water until the water level was about half an inch over the rice. Bring to a boil, then reduce to simmer for 20 minutes. Turn off heat, toss once and let sit for 5 minutes. Sometimes I'd use some mayo on the chicken to add flavor.Dish #4 - Baked PastaThis one is fancy and stupidly simple. However, it cost more than most of the other dishes. Boil whatever pasta you have handy: penne or ziti are good for this. Strain and put into a throw-away aluminum foil baking dish. Pour enough of your favorite jarred tomato sauce to just coat all the pasta, but not so much that you've got soup. Then shred lots of mozzarella cheese into it, toss it, and then add some more cheese on top. Cover with aluminum foil and bake at 375 for 35 minutes (or however long your stomach will let you wait). If you want to get crazy, buy some Italian sausage, grill it in your grill pan and slice it into the mix. You're a chef!Dish #5 - Fancy Cous CousEveryone always thinks this is fancy, but it's so easy and cheap. Buy any box of easy couscous (like Near East brand) and follow the box instructions to cook, this is usually five minutes of work. Meanwhile start dicing zucchini and carrots as small as you can get them. Ideally, you're looking for a brunois. But since you're in college, you shouldn't care that much. Toss those into the hot couscous, along with some golden raisins and LOTS of black pepper. Let it stand, covered, for 5-10 minutes before eating. You will be amazed how good this tastes. If you want to make it fancy garnish with some ripped, flat leaf parsley.Dish #6 - Super Mac & CheeseFollow the instructions to make your favorite mac & cheese. I always liked the cheapest I could find. About 30 seconds before it's done, per the box instructions (this should be after the cheese is melted and stirred), toss in a handful of frozen peas and a pile of diced ham steak. Add about another minute to the cooking time, to let the peas get hot. If you want to get fancy with this dish try broiling the ham steak, covered in Worcestershire sauce for about 5 minutes before dicing it. It adds so much flavor for so little work.Dish #7 - The Best DessertIn those days, I didn't even know what the words \"lactose intolerance\" meant. I would buy whole milk, stir in Hershey's chocolate syrup and some heavy cream to make a thick, rich homemade chocolate milk. You could just buy pre-made chocolate milk, but it won't be as rich. Then I'd toss in a pile of vanilla ice cream.

The mac 'n cheese, is reminscent of one of Stephen's favorite, Chili Mac.  Make mac & cheese from box as directed, open can of beanless chili, add to cooked mac & cheese, stir, eat.  And, for the authentic experience eat from the pot, with the wooden spoon used for mixing while in the kitchen - or while standing in front of tv.

NYC Calories Regulations Backfires for Cold Stone
CONTENT
Earlier today (while working on the Jelly Belly post) I was browsing around Cold Stone Creamery's web site and looked for nutritional information. It wasn't particularly easy to find. After some clicking, the FAQ page had a link to the \"Nutritional Information/Ingredient\" page. Guess what, that's not it. That page is several paragraphs about how Cold Stone is concerned about nutrition and therefore provides light options. Buried in that page is an anonymous link labeled \"click here\" that seemed like a winner. It was pretty surprising that instead of seeing the nutrition info, I saw the following statement:Weird, huh? I wasn't aware that nutrition values change by geographic area. But oh well, assuming it was either just a ruse to collect ZIP info or possibly that Cold Stone only offers certain products in certain areas, I entered my New York City ZIP and then got to the \"nutrition filter\" page, with the following message:We fully support the intent of this regulation; however, since most of our products are made-to-order, there simply isn't enough room on our existing menu boards to comply with the regulation. As a result, we will no longer be able to provide nutritional information to residents and customers of our New York City stores. We regret this inconvenience. For ingredient and allergen information, please click here. If you have questions about this regulation, please contact the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene and refer to Health Code Section 81.50.Way to stick it to the NYC DoH and to all NYC residents who are interested in being healthy. Screw 'em... I mean \"us\"! In just a few minutes (that's all it takes) to read through Health Code Section 81.50 I failed to see what part of the code indicates why Cold Stone would not show nutrition information on their web site. IANAL (I'm not a lawyer) but it seems pretty clear that Cold Stone just does not want to show the nutritional info. It was easy enough to find a non-NYC ZIP and throw that in, and see a real Cold Stone Creamer Nutritional Information page. What an annoying exercise!Apparently, I'm not the first person to find this irritating. A Los Angeles Library had similar issues last year. Just a month ago fellow NYC'er Marion Nestle updated us on what is happening NYC with calorie labeling.

Regardless of how bad the nutrition facts are for a dish, we have the right to know and make decisions.  People don’t (shouldn’t) go out to ice cream and expect a healthy menu.  I do understand the frustration felt by restaurants like Cold Stone whose nutrition analysis is complicated due to multiple combinations.  But there are resources out there that don’t need to cost a fortune, and can help them come up with a solution, for example http://www.cookedapple.com, a resource for restaurants who need nutrition facts, and help with compliance to these laws.

Jelly Belly & Cold Stone Join Forces to Make me Fat
CONTENT
In order to compensate for offering flavors like vomit, skunk spray, and rotten egg, Jelly Belly has swung all the way to the other side of the deliciousness scale with a co-branded offering along side Cold Stone Creamery. The new beans come in five flavors that any cream head will recognize: Chocolate Devotion, Birthday Cake Remix, Apple Pie a la Cold Stone, Our Strawberry Blonde, and Mint Mint Chocolate Chip.The first thing I noticed as I gobbled down a few of the colorful beans is how much they taste like the real thing! The chemical goodness is remarkable. The second thing I realized is that I would really rather just have the real thing. Although, at only 100 calories per serving it is a bit easier on the waist line than the 3-400 calories of a small of the real thing. But it does make me want the real thing... real bad!

The only one we found disappointing with the Birthday cake remix.  Perhaps because it's Kasi's favorite we've had that flavor a lot, but the bean seemed to taste like whichever one it'd been next to - the first one tasted like chocolate and the second strawberry.

Moroccan Spiced Meatloaf
CONTENT
Inspired by the nicely spiced lamb meatballs at Alta, I decided to make Moroccan Spiced Meatloaf. Lon happens to love meatloaf and the last time I made it, he raved. I love when he loves my food so I thought this would be a good shot and I think this one beat the last one!Moroccan Spiced Meatloaf1. Spray a 9×5 loaf pan with non-stick and preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.2. Combine beef, onion, shallots, egg, bread crumbs, 1/2 cup tomato sauce, and 2 tablespoons Morrocan spice mixture. Mix thoroughly.3. Press into loaf pan and make an indent down the center.4. Mix the remaining tomato sauce with brown sugar and rounded teaspoon of Morrocan spice mixture. Pour on top of the meatloaf.5. Bake at 375 degrees F for approximately 55 minutes or until thermometer reads 160 degrees F. Let it rest for 5 minutes before serving.The Moroccan Spiced Meatloaf was too easy to make for something this good. It was so moist and flavorful and both of us had large seconds. I only had beef on hand but using some turkey could cut out a lot of fat. Enjoy!

We brought my mom to Sushi Yasuda this time and she loved every bite! No surprise here. I still love every bite of all my favorites, week after week. Tonight, Chef Tomura told me they had 4 types of Uni available and gave me a piece of California Uni (which I had on my 3rd visit) next to a piece of Russian Uni. The Russian Uni dissolves in your mouth instantaneously and the flavor is lighter as well. You can see (on the right) that it's very wet and has less body. I think I still prefer the Uni from California.I asked about Copper River Salmon again because I know it should be coming soon and Chef Tomura admitted that it came in today, but it wouldn't be available till tomorrow. I nearly sobbed but settled on a reservation for Tuesday where he advised me to have the Wild Salmon Roe, also available starting tomorrow. I did feel better when Chef Tomura presented me with a piece of King Salmon from New Zealand, rich with flavor and fat, and a stunning color.I'll leave you here since I'll be back on Tuesday.

Alta
CONTENT
Alta Alta has been on my list of places I want to try for a while. Finally made it over there!The space is cozy and inviting, the upstairs is more romantic. The menu is set up tapas style and has the longest selection I've seen so far. We started with three recommendations from the waiter and the first to arrive was the Crispy Brussels Sprouts with fuji apples, creme fraiche, and pistachios, a dish two of my friends have raved about. It was certainly a unique preparation but it didn't meet the hype for me. I generally liked it but still have a few complaints. The \"crispy\" sprouts were really just overly charred and the different bites of the dish tasted differently. A sweet and apple-licious syrupy sauce sat on the bottom of the bowl while some creme fraiche was drizzled on a few sprouts on top. So some pieces tasted of creme fraiche, and some were too sweet (sitting on the bottom), but a few pieces in the middle exhibited the wonderful combination of both, the way I believe the whole dish was meant to be. So, if you get this dish, toss it before eating.Next, the Peperoncino Spaghetti (Bottarga Di Muggine, dried bonito & shrimp oil, and peppercress), the one our waiter seemed most excited about, did not really excite us. While there were hints of nice flavors going on, it was overwhelmed by just being too oily. I'm not sure if I liked the stickiness of the roe either resulting in just a forgettable dish for me.We're most thankful for the Lamb Meatball recommendation, the favorite for me and Lon. The nicely spiced and tender meatballs were just so perfectly balanced with the sweet butternut squash and creamy lebne.Now for our choices, the House Cured Duck Breast with mirin scented faro, artichoke puree, and foie gras mousse was unique and just wonderful. The duck breast had nice elasticity, wrapped around a smooth and lightened foie gras mousse, with chewy pieces of faro. It was rich and decadent without being too heavy.Our worst choice was the Crabmeat Cannelloni, with almonds and grapes, creme fraiche-verjus foam. The crab came in nice large chunks but it just didn't taste fresh and the combination of flavors was very unappetizing for both of us. The sauce, tasting much like whipped cream with grapes and almonds, was fine on it's own but odd with the crab. Somewhere in there was something very minty that turned me off as well.Luckily, we ended off with a bang, Lon's second favorite of the night, Squid Ink Paella. The rice was cooked perfectly and we loved the ultra flavorful mix of preserved lemon, guindillas peppers and scallions, each adding a special something to this dish. The shrimp was over-cooked but the other shellfish were fine.Lon and I really applaud Chef Harrison Mosher for being daring. Since Lon and I dine out a lot, it can get quite boring and redundant. Eating at Alta was refreshing and fun. Since the prices are very reasonable, we're not unhappy with one bad dish. It was worth it to taste the experimentation of all these other dishes. We'll be back soon to try more of the exciting menu.

Copper River Salmon
CONTENT
We first encountered Copper River Salmon last year, and I've been waiting for it to come back into season since! It is like salmon on crack and the season only lasts a few weeks so I want to make sure I catch it. It seems to be a bit late this year but it looks like Seattle has started getting some already, albeit in smaller quantities and higher prices. I called Salmon River Restaurant to see when they thought they would be getting it and the gentlemen told me the fishing of Copper River Salmon was banned this year and so no one would get it. I have not found any corroborating evidence of that so don't worry yet. I'll let you know as soon as I find it here in NYC but if you don't want to wait for the restaurants and markets here to get it, you can order it from Alaska directly.

Have you tried Yukon River Salmon? It's actually quite a bit higher in oil content (read: more delicious) than copper river, but it's not marketed as well so it usually costs less. Don't get me wrong, Copper River is FABULOUS, but it's just an idea for an alternative. The Yukon run usually starts a week or two after Copper River.

Danny Brown Wine Bar & Kitchen
CONTENT
I'm so happy to have found Danny Brown Wine Bar & Kitchen Danny Brown Wine Bar & Kitchen by my parents house in Forest Hills. The somewhat eclectic menu seems to take French and Italian inspirations and just focuses on making simple food correctly. The formula pleased us all (my mom, dad, brother, Lon, and I) so it'll probably become a family spot for us.We started with a Large Board, a selection of cured meats and various cheeses, served with fig compote, whole grain mustard, cornichons, and balsamic vinegar. The Serrano ham and Rosette de Lyon (cured pork salami) was pretty standard, but their house made Pate de Campagne (pork an veal) stood out as extra light and extremely fresh tasting. Most of us did not like the Bresaola (air-dried filet of beef) as much because it was slightly gamey and lacked flavor.The board came with such a generous portion of cheeses, Manchego, Parmigiano-Reggiano, Brie de Mieux, Boucheron, and a blue (can't remember the name), all delicious. A basket of sliced baguette and sliced walnut cranberry raisin bread is essential, and we went through two baskets while thoroughly enjoying our company and sampling the board. My dad (a non-cheese fan, how embarrassing) even found that he liked the Brie and ended up eating all of it. Next time, I think the small board will be enough.We chose another two appetizers to share and we were thoroughly impressed with both. The Salmon Tartare with black olives, celery leaves, capers & creme fraiche was so unique and so well balanced, super fresh and beautifully plated. It's a good thing it was twice the size of a Manhattan version of salmon tartare because we all (except my dad who doesn't eat raw fish, again embarrassing) wanted seconds, thirds, and fourths, especially with those light little toasts it came with.The Grilled Calamari with Rosemary and White Beans managed to be light and refreshing and comforting at the same time. I didn't taste the rosemary but the baby arugula greens were so fresh and the calamari was perfectly cooked, and the white beans thickened the olive oil so nicely. By now, we were already getting full and we still had entrees coming.I'm glad I chose a somewhat lighter entree, the Hand Made Pappardelle with oven Dried Tomato Sauce & Arugula. It was a simple and beautiful looking dish.My brother ordered the Strip Steak, which was seasoned with fennel and oregano, cooked as ordered, with a huge amount of very good bite sized roasted potatoes, soft inside and crispy outside. (Sorry, no pic) But, if you are going to order steak, my mom got the Hanger Steak with Crispy Fries and Red Wine Shallot Butter and that was killer! Gorgeous medium rare color, a huge amount of the best fries, and wow that red wine shallot butter was amazing, even for someone who doesn't usually like sauce on steaks. Everyone raved over my mom's plate.My dad and Lon both chose a special, a spaghetti with chopped clams and pancetta. The chopped scallions and slight kick really rounded out the cohesive flavors. Lon really licked his bowl clean!We were absolutely stuffed but managed to finish all but a little cheese, but we couldn't squeeze down dessert, which I'll have to try next time. Danny Brown had impressed us in seemingly simple ways, meat cooked to correct temperature, fresh ingredients, and nice lighting so I can see my food. These qualities are not so easy to come by these days. The value is also undeniable. You would easily pay 30% more for the same dishes in Manhattan and likely get much smaller portions. I can't wait to go back!

What is Rocket?
CONTENT
Melinda was trying to recall the ingredients in a woo woo. She recalled one of the main components was vodka, which Gabe misheard for \"rocket\". He asked if I knew what rocket was, honestly, I had no idea what he was talking about. He said that Gordon Ramsay uses it as an ingredient regularly on his BBC shows. I had to know...It took a few minutes of googling, because \"rocket\" is way too generic a term, to find the Wikipedia entry on London Rocket (note that it was pretty easy to find plenty of recipes calling for \"handfuls\", which is seems to be the chosen unit of measure for rocket, of the stuff). Turns out rocket is simply a branch of the mustard green family of weeds. Now I wonder if I can get my hands on some of the stuff 'round these parts.

Rocket and arugula are used interchangeably in much European cuisine, esp in the UK and Italy. They have similar flavours, with a bit of a peppery bite to the greens.

Dong Yi Feng
CONTENT
Dong Yi Feng (Tung Yi Fung) Dong Yi Feng is my mom's regular dim sum place. She goes there with her Mahjong group every Wednesday and most of the staff knows her. I've been there several times and just realized I haven't blogged it. It's generally a very reliable place with a broad selection, even on weekdays.This time, I was a bit disappointed that the Shrimp Dumpling skins and the Chive Dumpling skins were a bit too thick but otherwise, stuff was good.The tripe (underneath the duck feet) was actually exceptional, tender yet bouncy, with so much flavor. Bring on the cholesterol.The pork ribs are a long time dim sum classic that are tasty but oily, so I limit consumption of it.Now, Beef Short Ribs have become pretty standard too. They are similar to the pork ribs but more peppery, again, sitting in a pool of oil (standard at any place you get it).The Clams in Black Bean Sauce (often only served on weekends) is one of my favorites. The giant plate of plump little clams is such a bargain at dim sum.There's usually only one offering of greens at dim sum. Most of the time, it's Chinese Broccoli with oyster sauce. I love it when they use the baby ones, bright green and tender.There's always a variety of dumplings and I can't even remember what filling these had now.These Shrimp Stuffed Chilies had such a great flavor and texture, except they were cold.These Roast Pork Pastries were flaky and buttery. Yum Yum Yum! we also got the regular steamed roast pork buns which I guess we forgot to take a picture of.My mom never goes to dim sum without eating her favorite fish balls. These were less spherical than most but still good with some extra herbs.My dim sum must-have, the shrimp wrapped in rice noodles, pretty average this time.My mom wanted us to try this other dish, which you have to order, it doesn't come around on the carts. It's a very soft rice noodle with cilantro in it. Pretty good.My brother always has to end his dim sum with the Coconut Jello Squares. I don't care for them though.I love going to dim sum with my family, the more the merrier, you get to try more stuff. It's great for family time, to sit and chat, eat at any pace you want, and sip the great tea.

How Clean Are Your Favorite Restaurants?
CONTENT
NYC restaurants are inspected by the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene and the records are made public on their website. Like the dorks that we are, we sat in front of the computer last night (joined by our friends Angie and Scott) and spent at least 45 minutes looking up the restaurants that we frequent.The inspections work on a point system and the less points the better, 27 or under being passing (with some fines of course), 28 and above equals a fail and the restaurant must be re-inspected after being given some time to correct the problems. It takes some serious points to get closed down by the DOHMH, like Veniero's did recently (with 73 violation points), and almost gaurantees I will never eat there again. (I really didn't like Veniero's much anyway.)However, don't get scared by a few points. Almost all restaurants have some. The inspectors search pretty hard for at least a few and some rules are such bull anyway and some have nothing to do with the cleanliness of your food. All those restaurants in Chinatown that hang meats in the windows are violating rules by not storing the meats in correct temperatures, all sushi chefs working on sushi with bare hands are in violation as well. Any guy you see at a deli or pizzeria making food without a hat on is at risk of being caught. Those things don't stop me from eating in Chinatown, enjoying sushi, or pigging out on pizza. So, when you look up your favorite places, you might see things like \"Choking first aid\" poster not posted or \"wash hands\" sign not posted, which would never stop me from visiting a restaurant but the violations related to mice or roaches definitely scare me. Keep in mind, the average is 15 points and it definitely makes a difference, what the points are from.Some notables....27 Violations and up is pretty bad in my book but again, check what they are for. It annoys me even more when it's the expensive restaurants cause they're charging so much, you'd think they could keep clean.Gold stars go to the places with 8 or less, especially if they are dumb, non-food related violations:

I don't think in every case it takes a lot to get shut down. Magnolia Bakery was shut down for having "Plumbing not properly installed or maintained". A co-worker's sister worked there when they got shut down for this and she said they had a sink there but they were supposed to have another one for another area. They had just been using that one sink, so they just re-arranged the place to re-open.

99 Cents Fresh Pizza
CONTENT
We walk by 99 Cents Fresh Pizza 99 Cents Fresh Pizza, every single time we go to Sushi Yasuda. I've been curious for a long time but I've never had the nerve to try it. For 99 cents, I wasn't sure if I would get sick from it or just be repulsed by pizza forever. Last night, as we headed home after a lovely dinner, I dared Scott (the man who eats more pizza than anyone I know) to try it and we all agreed to try it together.I have to admit, it wasn't that bad. It wasn't that great either but really, it wasn't the worst I've tasted for sure, so for 99 cents plus tax, it's not a bad deal. It really needs more sauce and a better quality cheese but the crust wasn't too bad, and the service was very friendly.Scott ended up eating 2 plain slices and Lon tried one with sausage. He liked the sausage and felt very satisfied for getting this slice for $1.50 plus tax.The two boys joked all the way home about how many slices or pies they could buy for the cost of an average dinner in NYC. It's almost a novelty shop to them. If you really analyze it though, it's not that ridiculously cheap because each slice is roughly half or less of a regular or average NYC slice. Ultimately, I enjoyed the entertainment of trying this slice once but I probably won't eat it again.

Thanks for trying this out! I work right around here and every time I pass by the sign, I read it aloud and have a little chuckle to myself. Sometimes people I walk with are extremely disgusted by the fact, and I laugh about that too..in any case, thanks for trying it out!!! Now I know!

The cheese slice looks delicious. I like the smaller slice idea, generally one is not quite enough and two is too much since it's so good and I eat while hot (read: too fast) then feel too full.

Sushi Yasuda Anniversary (#10)
CONTENT
It's my tenth visit to Sushi Yasuda Sushi Yasuda. Hooray! This marks another birthday dinner since Scott and Angie insisted on treating us. My favorite pieces are still orange clam, peace passage oyster, and Spanish Mackerel, but I'm still always eager to try new pieces. The wasabi alone is worth going for and the teas they serve are just heavenly.Tonight, Lon did a side-by-side tasting of the four house-made eels and really enjoyed them all. The House Made Unagi (dark fresh water eel) and Shirayaki (white fresh water eels) were a bit firmer and display fattier skins. The Shirayaki is slightly less gamey than the Unagi.The Anago (Dark Seal Eel) and Sawani (White Seal Eel) are more tender. Again, the white is slightly less gamey than the dark, and Sawani wins as the best of the eels. It is incredibly tender and delicate, with a natural sweetness that is brought out by the pinch of sea salt added on top.We also tried a Sawani roll (sorry, no pics, they came out blurry) which was good, but it's really better as sushi. While we were all marveling at how remarkable the seaweed is, Lon asked Chef Tomura what they do to make it so good. He just laughed a little and explained that it was four times more expensive than the seaweed used at most other places.My new piece tonight was Kinmedai (pictured right) which is one of the prettiest pieces I've ever had. It was a shiny silver with pink specs, and had the most interesting texture, a cross between snapper and clam.I'm glad I came here tonight, right after eating at Ushiwakamaru so I could do a close comparison. The pieces here are smaller, but the quality is just SO much better. Each bite impresses me, every single piece is fresh, and the difference was made so clear to me. I've been to some highly rated places like 15 East, Tomoe, Sushi of Gari 46, Hatsuhana, Inagiku (before blogging days), and so far, Sushi Yasuda is the best by leaps and bounds. That doesn't mean I'll stop trying other places though.

Broadway Restaurant Supply
CONTENT
Just wanted to make sure everyone knows about this fairly hidden restaurant supply store. The name is Broadway Restaurant Supply Broadway Restaurant Supply, which doesn't matter since they don't have a sign outside. Just look for a dirty window with some pots and pans in it. It's next to some cheap hair cut place. Anyways, it looks like a crappy warehouse inside, but it has good prices for restaurant supplies, while being way more convenient to get to than Bowery. We've purchased various baking pans, bench scrapers, spatulas, whisks, skewers, pyrex dishes, spiders, squeeze bottles, tongs, bamboo steamer, a replacement paddle for the kitchen aid, and probably a lot more. Trust me, good place to know.

Ushiwakamaru
CONTENT
An anonymous comment posted last Sunday enticed me to try Ushiwakamaru Ushiwakamaru:\"I had just gone to Ushiwakamaru the night before and that became the best sushi I've had in New York...\"Well, that set my expectations quite high and I was very excited. I decided on the 15 piece Omakase, sushi and sashimi, which turned out to be a roller coaster for me. Some pieces were great, most were good, and a few were pretty disappointing. Starting with the green tea, it annoyed me because it was barely warm, but then the sashimi portion arrived and I was curious about the three tea cups placed in front of me. The first was salmon roe and a delicious pile of salmon roe it was, soothing juices of the sea, not too salty, fun to pop on your tongue a few at a time.The next was so interesting, baby sea eels swimming (not actually swimming, they were dead) in some marinade. I couldn't taste anything other than the marinade though so it was more appealing because of the cool I've never tried that before factor, but I don't really desire it again.The uni was a big disappointment for me. It wasn't creamy and it had a muddy fishiness that I only know how to discribe in Chinese as tu shing. Can someone translate that for me?The next few pieces of sashimi were laid on a plate together. The Striped Bass was fresh but even better was the stuff beneath it. It looks like cellophane noodles but it's actually noodles made from seaweed, which were chewy and crunchy. Loved it.The Snapper was very average.So was the Horse Mackerel.The fresh shrimp was pretty good. I prefer the raw one over the cooked ones.Next was a long plate with 8 pieces of sushi and here is where I'm a moron! I forgot to take a picture of it cause I was too busy talking to my friends but actually it wasn't that impressive look-wise. The Sea Eel (cooked) was rather boring, just cooked in a little sweetened soy sauce. The White Shrimp was very good, soft and dissolves in your mouth. The giant clam was just ok, didn't seem too fresh. I was annoyed to get another piece of Horse Mackerel since it already appeared in my sashimi portion but this cut tasted better than the sashimi slices. The fluke was no better than any cheap local sushi joint. The yellowtail was good. I can't remember the Esaki snapper anymore. Good thing I wrote each piece down. The Toro was certainly fatty but didn't really wow me as I expected after all the hype.At some point, the waitress dropped off an extra piece, a fried shrimp head. It was fried nicely, not at all oily, and who could resist an extra piece.In the end, I found myself disappointed in the wasabi which was just average. I just expect supposed top places to have all those little details in check.I was pleasantly surprised by the dessert menu though. A Japanese restaurant with interesting desserts? We all liked the Green Tea Mille Crepes, so light and delicate, such excellent assembly. I was definitely impressed except I really wish it tasted more like green tea.The Sesame Ice Cream was also wonderful. It has the aroma of toasted black sesame and the texture was creamy, balanced with just the right mild sweetness.The red bean and rice cake dessert (forgot the name) was good but so skimpy, with only 2 little pieces of rice cake in the whole serving. To give a little perspective, that spoon is only slightly larger than my thumbnail. Come on!Overall, the fish did not wow me but it was pretty good with some interesting items. The desserts were actually more notable, but I'll reserve final judgment until I can come eat at the sushi bar. (I was with a group that didn't want to sit at the bar cause it's hard to talk to each other that way.) I'm also hoping that it was a fluke (haha) that it leaned towards more white fleshed fish which are not my favorites.Important side note: My friend Lily pointed out that they print your full credit card number on the receipt they keep, which I think is illegal. Make sure to scribble it out! Identity theft is prevalent and it sucks!!

Looks fantastic-too bad about the toro, it's my favorite piece and usually serves as the barometer for how much I enjoy an establishment.Keep an eye on your credit card statements. I used to work at a restaurant that printed the full credit card number, and even if patrons scratched out the numbers, it is easy to access the original from the database. Some places even print duplicate copies (one for the patron, one that goes directly into a file that is later adjusted for tips).

Zerza and Cake from Koryodang and Cafe Muse
CONTENT
My wonderful friend Sara planned a birthday dinner for me at Zerza Zerza, a Moroccan restaurant seemingly conceptualized for groups. They have a three course party dinner menu ($30 per person) with a nice amount of choices and the dining room on the second floor was serving 4 groups (including ours) last night. Our party of 9 looked small next to the party of 12, so I was impressed that our dishes were all served at roughly the same time. There was a long lag between appetizers and entrees, and our waitress confused one of our appetizers and one dessert, but they did try very hard to be a pleasant service staff.I liked the Grilled Merguez, Spicy Lamb Sausages with a poached egg and chickpeas. Some of the sausages were a little burnt but they were very flavorful. The poached egg in the center could've taken this dish up a notch if the yolk was runny but alas it was not, cooked to medium.The Meze Plate was a generous portion of Matbucha, Babaghanough, and Hummus. Everyone seemed to favor the Matbucha, a cumin flavored spinach and chickpea mixture, reminiscent of Saag without being creamy. The Babaghanough was much more of a Moroccan version of caponata, with identifiable pieces of eggplant, rather than mashed, but it was still pretty good, and the hummus was average as well.The pita was decent but necessary for the Meze Plate.I loved that the tagine dishes were served in actual tagines. (I really want to buy one but they're expensive and take up so much space.)The Tagine Lamb Tfaya was very sweet, with tender meat and an enormous amount of raisins (the largest I've ever seen) and chickpeas. There was a very subtle heat that built up by the end of the dish.The Chicken Tagine with preserved lemon, potatoes, and Moroccan olives was also impressively tender and well flavored.The Mrouzia Beef Short Ribs were also pretty sweet. The meat fell right off the bone. All of these dishes were served with a bowl of plain cous cous.The Chermoula Rubbed Wild Salmon was a bit over-cooked but the dryness is masked by the sauce and spinach mixture.The Fig Ice Cream has nice chunks of fig in it but it's a bit too sweet.The Fruit Cup with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top is pretty bad. The ice cream is fine but the fruit is not so fresh.Luckily, Angie brought two beautiful cakes with candles that spelled out \"Happy Birthday\".The Chocolate Cake, from Koryodang Koryodang, is very Asian bakery style, which is ultra light and fluffy, much less sweet (my preference) than American style cakes. The spongy texture with layers of cream was very nice but I often find that there isn't enough chocolate flavor in these cakes.The Red Velvet Cake, from Cafe Muse Cafe Muse, was a wonderful color, really moist, and the frosting was great. There wasn't any chocolate flavor in this cake though which Red Velvet really should.Zerza is really a good spot for groups/birthday parties. It's affordable for everyone, large portions of good, not amazing food, and you do n't feel ultra cramped. They will refrigerate the cakes for you, set up the candles and light them, and serve them, with no plating charges. Keep them in mind if your sick of going to Chinatown of Koreatown for all your group parties.

Cook's Illustrated did a comparison of tagines vs. dutch ovens ("do you really need a tagine?") and the conclusion was, no, tagines aren't necessary. So you're good! Just whip out that Le Creuset.

I also want to mention that the owner/general manager was very accomodating when I spoke to him on the phone when placing the reservation.  Even though I only called a week in advance, he gave me the time slot that I wanted and he offered entrees in our pri-fixe menu that would be appealing to everyone.  Like Jess mentioned, I also really appreciate that the restaurant did not charge plating fees for the bday cakes.  However, I do have to say that the wine that the waitress recommended was quite disappointing.

Pinkberry
CONTENT
Since I covered Flurt and Yolato, I felt like I had to try Pinkberry today to feel complete. Pinkberry has three flavors and I sampled each. The coffee was vile, sour coffee is not a good thing, the green tea didn't taste enough like green tea, but the plain was good if you think of it as a yogurt flavored sorbet. It's not creamy enough to call it frozen yogurt for me, so in that arena, only Flurt makes the mark so far. As I ate the second half, thinking of it as sorbet, I did enjoy it, but a minute after I was done, my mouth felt very dry and then the sour aftertaste lingered for a while. It wasn't terrible but I did need water.Pinkberry does gets points for extremely good blueberries but overall, this small cup with blueberries is expensive for $4.23. If the idea is to make these frozen yogurts healthy so that you can have them often, then they need to be priced so you can have them often. For me, no thanks, I prefer having ice cream and/or gelato in moderation.

I concur the coffee was vile, but with a good assortment of fruits (non-sour), the plain yogurt can be a good complement. Red Mango was slightly better, but I will try Flurt and Yolato as recommended.

The gelato doesn't count, I'm comparing the frozen yogurts (which is that soft-serve stuff from the machines) and it sucks!Also, it is very deceiving which I don't like, it's vague on the website, but when I went to the store and asked to clarify, they told me the gelato in the cooler case is just regular gelato, only the machine one is the one that is supposedly healthier.

Have you tried Forty Carrots inside bloomingdales (7th floor)? The original is very creamy and tart, the other flavors tend to taste like the flavors without the yogurty tartness. The small is a little under 5 dollars but, they give you well worth your moneys worth. It's enough for two people to share. I usually tell them not to fill it all the way. Try it out if you're in midtown!

SOS Chefs

I was looking for spices and came across SOS Chefs SOS Chefs on-line. It's pretty out of the way but on a nice day, I couldn't resist exploring. The place has just a tad more decor than a warehouse and you wouldn't know what they were selling from the outside. Yet, as soon as I entered, I got all excited, standing on tippy toes to see the tops of each shelf, sniffing around, much like my dog at Petco.A very helpful women showed me the different offerings, starting with spices since I was looking to buy some allspice. She recommended Sumac, a spice I had never heard of. It smelled good and has a wonderful deep purple/maroon color so I bought a bit to try. I had to resist buying several different oils, flavored salts, honeys and preserves, and limited myself to some allspice, Sumac, caper berries, and harissa. Can't wait to try all of this out!

Flurt
CONTENT
Ellen posted this comment 2 weeks ago and it was finally warm enough for me to try Flurt's Flurt frozen yogurt today:I have tried three frozen yogurt places: Flurt, Pinkberry and Berry Wild.Flurt (3rd Ave. between 22nd & 23rd) is my favorite. It’s rich and creamy with a wonderful sour yogurt flavor. Despite being creamy, it also comes off as refreshing and light.Pinkberry comes in as a very close second. I find it slightly less creamy than Flurt. They also make a green tea version which was very disappointing, even though I love green tea.Berry Wild makes two versions; creamy and icy. The icy is not as creamy and has slight yogurt flavor. Overall this one just tasted watered down. The creamy version was too creamy and hardly has any yogurt flavor.So my final verdict is Flurt and Pinkberry are both fantastic. And I’m never going back to Berry Wild. They all offer small samples to try before you buy. And various fruit and crunchy toppings.\"Ellen, thank you so much for the recommendation! After Yolato and Red Mango disappointed me with their tart and icy products, I wouldn't have gone to try another frozen yogurt place. But as you said, Flurt makes a nice and creamy frozen yogurt that is quite refreshing. The sourness of the yogurt flavor is well balanced so that it is enjoyable on it's own, which is healthy and fat-free.Since it was my first visit, I asked Alex Kim (one of the founders/owners) for his way of eating it. He says it changes over time, but currently, he is having it with strawberries, bananas, crushed oreos, and cinnamon toast crunch cereal. It was truly a treat and I will most likely be back.

I've never been to Flurt so I'll have to try it out. My favorite is Forty Carrots at Bloomingdales. Its creamier than Pinkberry and some of the other places I've been to so its more up my alley. They don't have a lot of topping selections though. The servings are huge. Make sure you bring someone so you can share. Besides, sharing is caring.

How is BirdBath Related to Bakery?
CONTENT
We've posted about Birdbath before, the green offshoot of The City Bakery, and while I was hoping to like it more this time (when my friend Angie brought some treats over), I actually liked it less. The Coconut Cookie was ok. The crispy cookie did taste like coconut and it seemed fresh, but that's about it, nothing memorable.The Sesame Banana Cake?? tasted very healthy with weird chunks of dried banana in it. I don't think 4 or more people got through even half of it. I hope this health-puck cures some disease.Then we saw something that looked more promising...But alas, those were doggie cookies for Ice. Ice loved them but she eats anything, literally anything.I'm seriously disappointed since I'm really for the green efforts, but now I'm pretty sure I'll be staying away from Birdbath.

Siggi's Skyr
CONTENT
On a past post, Wonders commented:\"I been having Siggi's Skyr lately, it's just as good and made with Skim Milk!! Just add a bit of honey (cus its extra tart) and it's good to go! Try it out! -=D\"I just tried the blueberry flavor and the plain. While this Icelandic style yogurt is better (because it's thicker) than the standard American style yogurt, it is extra tart, as you mentioned. The blueberry is tart but still palatable on it's own, although I still prefer the flavored Fage yogurts. The plain has a similar taste to the Fage 0%, I guess because they are both fat free, but I don't like either. I am a big fan of the 2% Fage in plain and often eat it on it's own. That bit of extra fat, well, my waist-line will just have to give in to the demands of my tongue, but my wallet will thank me as well, considering Siggi's is much more expensive. ( It's $2.69 for a 6oz container of Siggi's and $1.99 for a 7oz container of Fage at my local Whole Foods.)In the end, I prefer Fage way way more, but I thank you for the recommendation and even though we don't agree this time, I hope you will continue to make recommendations.

I usually go for Fage 0%. But recently I did try skyr in 2 different brands, Skyr.is and Siggi's Skyr. I tasted strawberry and plain in Skyr.is. The strawberry was just okay but I preferred the plain and added my own honey to it. I bought Siggi's Skyr in Orange/Ginger flavor... I couldn't eat it. I had 2 bites and it went in the garbage... I usually never throw food away so I think that says a lot!

Aw that's too bad that you didn't enjoy it. Actually the Mint Pear flavor is the best out of all the flavors. Yeah it is very very tart, I really can't eat it on it's own. And it is pretty pricey, not something I would buy often or in bulk. I'm glad you at least tried it, even though you didn't like it! -=)

I bought myself a yogurt maker since I eat so much yogurt. The great thing about it is I can control the texture and choose which kind of milk to use. I use skim milk but add dry milk powder to make it extra thick. It comes out creamy and is the freshest tasting yogurt.

Ellen, what brand/model did you get? I might want one but Lon doesn't eat much yogurt.
Ellen

On hindsight, I would purchase a yogurt maker that makes a full quart instead of in individual containers. This way I can vary my individual portions more easily.

Thanks Ellen. I'll have to think about it. It's not too expensive but it takes space.

Ilili
CONTENT
Between Lon's acupuncture appointment and ballroom dancing lessons (for our first dance), we had to squeeze in a quick dinner. Unfortunately, we were in that area, I call the culinary black hole, around the upper 20s by Fifth Avenue. To our great surprise, we found a diamond in the rough, Ilili Ilili. This very large and newly renovated Lebanese restaurant just opened in November and I haven't heard anything about it. The injustice!Well, we didn't have much time this evening but we rushed through a dinner and the staff was very accommodating. They start you off with some complimentary labne (strained yogurt) and olives. Lon loved the olives while I licked up the Lebanese yogurt. I seriously love Middle Eastern and Greek yogurts. They must laugh at Dannon over there.The Shishito Bi Labne was so delicious and nothing like anything I've had before. It seems simple, shishito peppers and onions baked in labne, in a cast iron dish, which keeps it hot throughout the meal. The varying heat of the peppers contrasting the thick creamy yogurt was such a draw for me, slathered on to the pita.The house-made pita isn't even that good, just mediocre, but I ate a lot anyway, as transportation for the Shishito Bi Labne to my mouth.The Black Cod sauteed with dried Zaatar, pomegranate molasses and fennel, was recommended by our waitress. It was incredibly tender and flaky, perfectly seasoned, atop some slightly sweetened braised fennel. We both oo'd and ahh'd.The Sardines were bony as always, a little plumper than average, but otherwise pretty standard in texture in flavor. There was a phenomenal gremolata-like mixture served on the side, made with lemon and/or lime zest ( I think), that was the highlight of the dish.Manti, a Lebanese pasta dish stuffed with beef and lamb and covered in minted yogurt, was made so elegantly here. We first experienced this dish at Ali Baba, but thought it was quite heavy. Here, the yogurt is presented as a foam on top of the ravioli and sauce, making the dish seem substantially lighter.These ravioli are not like the Italian kind. Here, the dough is a very thin, barely noticeable layer, surrounding little meatballs.Lon's favorite dish was the Duck Shawarma, presented as wraps. The meat was tender and well seasoned. The pairing of fig, pomegranate, and garlic was wonderful. One wrap was rather dry oddly, since the other wasn't.Lon and I had to rush this meal but were still glad to have found this place. So I can't pronounce the name, but four out of five dishes were a hit! We're definitely planning on coming back for a more relaxed dinner where we can really enjoy all this good, and rather unique food. Hopefully, we'll be coming in a group so we can try more dishes. We both agreed that we'd like to order most of these dishes again.

I love love love labne. I wish more grocery stores sold it here in the U.K. Normally, if I go to the middle eastern groceries, I can find it, but otherwise...I can only dream about it! How long do you think before labne goes mainstream?
Jessica@Foodmayhem
2008-05-13 20:28:00
Krista, I started having Fage (greek yogurt) about 4-5 years ago and now it's pretty main stream, along with a  lot of other brands. Now that we also have Skyr, Icelandic style yogurt, I hope Labne is close behind. My best guess is soon....got my fingers crossed.

Bed Bath & Beyond Coupons
CONTENT
Since readers seemed to appreciate my saving tip last week, I thought I'd mention another one. Do you get Bed Bath & Beyond coupons in the mail? If you want to, you can sign-up here. They usually send 20% off coupons which makes a really nice savings on kitchen appliances. They have expiration dates but they actually NEVER EXPIRE!! Lon's mom told us about this a while ago and I've used two year old coupons. No problem. So by yourself that ice cream maker you wanted!

Mother's Day Brunch
CONTENT
We had both families over to celebrate Mother's Day. It was a challenge to create a menu for the three mom's, mine, Lon's, and Kasi (Lon's sister and new mom). My mom is allergic to lemon and lime, Lon's mom cannot have any balsamic or red wine vinegar or red onion, and Kasi keeps kosher.Watercress, Cara Cara Navel, and Edamame SaladVeggie & Goat Cheese SandwichesMini Spinach Laguiole QuicheMaple BaconAncho Cornmeal Crusted TilapiaCream Cheese Pound CakeThe Watercress, Cara Cara Navel, and Edamame Salad is one I will have to write a recipe for, probably soon. The salad is mainly just those three ingredients, which looked beautiful together, with a vinaigrette, made from freshly squeezed juice, Orange Muscat Vinegar (from Trader Joe's), Honey Dijon Mustard, ground ginger, and salt and pepper. My mom ate several helpings of it and was totally impressed.The Veggie and Goat Cheese Sandwiches are one of my vegetarian favorites. They are great to mostly prepared the day before, fire roasting orange and yellow bell peppers, grilling zucchini with garlic powder, salt and pepper, and grilling Japanese eggplant marinated in white wine vinegar, olive oil, thyme, and oregano. Today, we just assembled them by spreading herbed goat cheese on Semolina bread and stacking the veggies.I wrote the recipe for the Mini Spinach Laguiole Quiche and you'll want to use it. This platter was cleaned out super fast and they are really adorable.Mini Spinach Laguiole Quiche1. Cream the butter and cream cheese together. Add flour and mix until well blended.2. Form 22-24 balls (about 1″) and refrigerate for 1 hour. Preheat oven to 350 degrees 20 minutes before dough is done chilling.3. While the dough is chilling, cook spinach to package instructions, drain well and set aside.4. When dough is ready, press into the bottom and sides of the mini muffin pan (sprayed with non-stick).5. Whisk together eggs, cream, salt and pepper. Stir in cheese and spinach.6. Spoon egg mixture into each cup. Bake for 20-25 minutes, until golden brown. Let stand for 5 minutes before serving.I asked Lon to make the time consuming Maple Bacon because it is just awesome. Of course, my dad ate way more bacon then he should have.Lon also made a great Ancho Cornmeal Crusted Tilapia with a Raspberry Aioli. Of course, he did not write down his recipe, and I doubt I'm going to be able to get him to.We finished with a Cream Cheese Pound Cake, a recipe from Nick Malgieri's Perfect Cakes. It was very dense which apparently, everyone really liked.It was a really lovely brunch and I would make any of these dishes again. If you haven't had enough yet, check out our menu from last year.Happy Mother's Day to all the wonderful mother's out there!

Jessica is right, no recipe written down for the fish.  I need to get a kitchen intern.  Anyway, here is the gist of what went in, if you want to try your hand at this one (all measurements are very rough, I didn't measure anything):I made a raspberry-garlic aioli by whipping an egg yolk with two mashed garlic cloves (mashed with a pinch of kosher salt), along with a tablespoon of honey dijon mustard.  Then I slowly drizzled in good extra virgin olive oil, until I had a bit over a cup of aioli.  Then I whisked in about three tablespoons of raspberry white wine vinegar and some more salt and white pepper to taste. Oh, I also sprinkled in a solid tablespoon of dried parsley.Separately, I shredded ancho chilis (dried poblanos), sans seeds, in the food processor.  Then I let them sit in about two teaspoons of hot water, for about an hour.I mixed about a cup of cornmeal and a 1/4 cup of bread crumbs with two teaspoons garlic powder, a tablespoon of dried parsley, and a teaspoon of mustard powder.  Then I moistened the mixture with about two tablespoons of the aioli and enough extra virgin olive oil for it to just be moist enough to clump.The tilapia was seasoned with salt and black pepper and flash fried lightly in vegetable oil in a cast iron skillet.  I undercooked the fish, about 40 seconds per side, then placed on a baking sheet.  The topping was piled atop each piece.  THe whole sheet baked at 400 for about 6 minutes, then broiled for 2.5 minutes.The fish was served on a plate with parsley, and the aioli on the side in minicups. Yum!

Two corrections... I only used one ancho, and I forgot to mention that I added the ancho mash into the cornbread topping mixture.
KasiandStephen
2008-05-12 13:08:00
Kasi found the fish too spicy and was told by Lon that it was Ancho and therefore not hot.  However, I find several places online that specify ancho/poblano as mild to moderate - I'm not crazy it was spicy!http://www.mccormick.com/content.cfm?id=10072http://www.epicurean.com/articles/hot-peppers.html
Lon
2008-05-12 13:37:00
Kasi, "spicy" is all relative, and many different food types (and their chemicals) give the sensation of spicy (piquant) without actually being spicy.  And people react to those different chemicals differently.  In regards to capsaicin and Scoville Ratings, ancho chilis are about as low as they come, in the range of 1000-1500 SUs, rating them from 1.5 - 8 times less spicy than a jalapeno or 15-50 times less spicy than tabasco.  By most people's terms, that's "not spicy".  Most chefs consider anchos sweet and berry like (hence their pairing with the raspberry aioli).There was tons of garlic in there and some black pepper, which contain allicin and piperine (respectively), both of which cause the "spicy" sensation for some people.From a third-party source, we'd prefer Penzey's advice over McCormick's.  We like to buy our spices from Penzeys Spices (we've mentioned them before) as they seem to be very knowledgeable and we've found their selection and quality to be superb.  Penzey describes Anchos as "sweet, rich peppers with very little heat".

I am sure the mom's loved this. Talking of spicy I remember how Sadri at langkawai would keep feeding us dishes and felt flummoxed that we did not find them to be spicy

Eight Course Salmon Tasting at Aquagrill
CONTENT
Lon really knows how to make a girl happy. I've been talking about how I want to be a judge on Iron Chef, so for my birthday, he called up a few restaurants to find out who would make a salmon tasting menu just for me. I would get to taste and judge each dish. The idea alone made me feel special enough, but Chef /Owner Jeremy Marshall at Aquagrill Aquagrill came up with quite an impressive menu, which was then executed almost flawlessly by his Chef de Cuisine John, only I'm pretty sure it took them more than the one hour Iron Chef would allot. They even printed a nice little menu for me.The eight courses of salmon were all well thought out, highlighting different types of salmon and different preparations, ordered in a progression that made sense, and overall just impressed us very much.The Aquagrill Salmon Tartare with Gauffrette Potato and Chive Oil was a good way to start, a bite sized display of light, familiar flavors.Before the 2nd tasting plate, we were given some house breads, a good cornbread with some kick, a fresh ciabatta, and a very moist onion focaccia.Next, the Scottish Smoked Salmon with Warm Buckwheat Blinis, Dill Pesto and Salmon Caviar in a Creme Fraiche Sauce. One of my two favorite dishes, every single component was perfect. The blini was so soft; the dill pesto refreshing; and the smoked salmon was amazingly tender. When you top that off with salty salmon eggs and creme fraiche sauce, the combination is magical and really highlights the salmon. I'm really sorry that the picture doesn't do justice to how beautifully this dish was plated.What salmon tasting would be complete without Crispy Smoked Salmon Skin? Here, they were crispy on one side, yet soft on the other where a bit of salmon meat was left on, a nice touch to a standard baby green salad with wild mushrooms and roasted garlic cloves. Lon even ate the mushrooms as an extra birthday present.Columbia River King Salmon Sashimi was a delicious dish but gets a few point deductions according to Iron Chef rules. The soy sauce was a bit over-powering for the sashimi, so I couldn't taste this special salmon as much as I would have liked to. The spicy Japanese eggplant (underneath, but you can't see) was phenomenal, kind of outshining the salmon. The texture was meaty and tender, not oily, and an amazing combination of a bit sweet, a hint of sour, and just a tad spicy. Lon and I wanted a whole plate of just that eggplant.Warm Peppered Arctic Char (technically not a salmon but in the same family so we'll let that slide) was perfect with the cool cucumber salad, and seasoned just so spot on. I wish you could see more clearly how perfectly it was coated and seared. Just beautiful!The Hot Smoked Atlantic Salmon Souffle was our least favorite dish. It wasn't bad, just extremely heavy (read: egg-y and butter-y) and the salmon on the bottom was a bit harder then the rest of the dishes. The Smoked Salmon Creme Fraiche Sauce was unique and better than the souffle, also helped it by cutting the fat a bit. We were so impressed with the presentation and even more so the innovation that we were still glad to have sampled this dish.The Falafel Crusted Atlantic Salmon with Hummus, Cucumbers, Tomatoes in a Lemon Coriander Vinaigrette was pure genius! While this dish is a decomposition of a falafel sandwich, it centered on the salmon; yet we loved it for all the reasons we love falafel sandwich: crunchy falafel, thick smooth hummus, cool tomatoes (which were peeled) and cucumbers, with a tangy dressing that I could lap up like a dog! You're in luck because we found out that this is a regular dish on their menu. Please go and have it!!Our final dish was Lon's favorite, Roasted Wild White Alaskan King Salmon with an Asparagus Risotto in a Mushroom Truffle Emulsion. This salmon was certainly unique, the flesh being a lot tighter than other types of salmon, kind of like swordfish, yet still flaked and parted the way salmon usually does. The risotto was wonderfully creamy and perfect for holding all the different parts together. Each bite must include white salmon, risotto, asparagus, and the rich mushroom emulsion to get the full glory, a perfect winter-y dish and a comforting end to the rainy day dinner.We were already stuffed after the white salmon, but of course we couldn't stop at eight courses... two courses for dessert rounded out the meal to a perfect ten! The Tropical Fruit and Sorbet was refreshing, nothing unique, but I really liked the fruit concasse.The Warm Chocolate Cake served as my birthday cake. It wasn't unique either, served with whipped cream, raspberry and chocolate sauces, but it was plated nicely. It was on the light side for chocolate cake, which was good, because it was less sweet, but it was also less chocolatey.Overall, we had an amazing evening, with wonderful service and great food. The ingredients used were top notch, and the pacing was comfortable, we hadn't noticed that 3 1/2 hours had passed. I don't remember exactly how the judging on Iron Chef goes but out of a possible 10 for each, I give Flavor: 9 , Presentation: 9, Originality: 8, Use of Ingredient: 8 and trust me, those are very high scores coming from me.Thank You to the team at Aquagrill for an incredibly memorable birthday dinner!

Ahhhhh salmon-the perfect Iron Chef star feature. I have to say, salmon is the only culinary ingredient the Pacific NW can tastefully produce.And you got Lon to eat mushrooms!

Randazzo's Clam Bar
CONTENT
Randazzo's Clam Bar Randazzo's Clam Bar doesn't look like much, no table clothes, no host, and water comes in a disposable plastic cup, but they've got extremely fresh seafood, and that's enough for me. Little Neck Clams on the half shell were super fresh, pink, and meaty.The Oysters were the best, served on the half shell, I've ever slurped down. The liquor was so clean, like a quick cleanse for your tongue, right before the slippery oyster slides across.The fat and juicy Steamers were cooked perfectly, releasing it's mild juices for us to drink. Following my mother's lead, I added two tiny drops of tabasco to each steamer which was just the right kick with a hint of acidity.The Linguine with White Clam Sauce was the most unadulterated version I've ever had. The chopped clams and linguine, paired only with garlic and parsley, sat in it's own juices, a preparation made possible by using only the freshest ingredients.I have to admit, I was completely surprised, judging a book by it's cover, I expected oily, trucker style food. It was nothing like that at all, showing so much restraint, and just letting the fresh seafood shine for itself. The meal came out to $53, a bit expensive for lunch, but I think the prices are the same for dinner, and it's completely worth it.

Sushi Yasuda - Quickie #9
CONTENT
I'm still as in love with Sushi Yasuda as the day I first tasted their sushi. I'm still getting new pieces on each visit and it's exhilarating to know such a place exists. On our 8th visit, we had tamago, the omelet, so this time, we tried the Custard, which Chef Tomura described as having shrimp and potato. The texture is still smooth like Tamago, so you will not find pieces of shrimp and potato but you will taste it, in the very tender custard.If you like Fatty Tuna, you must try the Cheek of the Fatty Tuna, it's even fattier! You can see the marbling and it just melts away in your mouth.On my 3rd visit, I had the Uni from California. This time, I tried the Uni from Alaska. Chef Tomura told me that it is the same species but I guess the environment makes a big difference. The Alaskan Uni is not at all briny, still creamy, but very gamey, in a fishy way. I prefer the California Uni because it was sweeter and I like some brininess.Lon wanted to have the soft shell crab again and it was a lot smaller (like half the size) than when we had it on our third visit, but it is coming up on the end of the season. That's why you have to listen to the chefs and let them recommend what to eat.

My husband and I had our version of your Sushi Yasuda when he lived in Boston. We went to this place called Fugakyu (in Brookline, Mass)at least once or twice a week. Now that we are in NY, we haven't found another sushi place that we like as much. Morimoto NYC and Blue Ribbon Sushi in Brooklyn comes close. Now I can't wait to try Sushi Yasuda!

I went to Sushi Yasuda tonight and cannot contain my disappointment.The good: I liked the tiny freebie appetizer, the tea, the presentation of the food, the utensils, the eel bone crackers, the fact that the appetizer menu was made from bamboo, the outrageous wide runway to the kitchen where there are usually tables, the roses in the bathroom.The bad: For a $63 omakase, I was definitely expecting more. It reminds me of my Tomoe experience: fresh but that doesn't mean that it's good. The fatty sushi melted in my mouth, as it's supposed to, but the taste of the fat wasn't there. It tasted rather bland and (like Tomoe) sour. I'm referring, for example, to the chuutoro, the ootoro, bonito and the yellowtail. I had thought my taste buds were playing tricks on me until I got a second opinion. I didn't sit at the bar with Tomura or Yasuda, but a great chef can't do much with fatty tuna that doesn't taste like what it's supposed to. I had just gone to Ushiwakamaru the night before and that became the best sushi I've had in New York, beating out Sushiden handily, so I had a baseline (and probably an unfair one at that) to go up against one of the most highly rated sushi restaurants in the city. I'd have to go back to both to validate the consistency, to be fair.

Anonymous, sorry you did not enjoy your experience. I am quite surprised since I've never had a bad experience in my 9 visits and I can think of at least 15 people off the top of my head that have gone on my recommendation and have made it their new favorite place.If you do feel like trying it again, I want to stress the importance of sitting at the bar with a chef. I learned from Chef Tomura that he feels the flavor degrades in just minutes so he does not recommend take-out/delivery/etc. When you sit at the bar, they pace out your pieces so you can eat them as they are made.I'll have to try Ushikawamaru....

Since I believe Tuesday is delivery day for sushi, it should remove any doubts about fish quality. I revisited Sushi Yasuda today and was surprised to see that Tomura is a young chef. My experience was slightly better this time around, but overall, it's really not what I had expected it to be. It scores on presentation, etc, but the fish could be a lot better for its price. The egg custard was huge (I wish the fish was anywhere near that size) and the best I've had. I figured out that the frequent use of lemon in the fish made some of the pieces sour -- I really wasn't a fan of that because it takes away from tasting the fish similar to the reason sushi chefs shun overdipping in soy sauce. It's probably my last Yasuda visit. In my opinion (and it's a minority one at that) Yasuda is very good, but not great, and greatly overpriced. I'm sure if you ever go to Seattle, you'll understand why. So Seattle aside and afar, I'm hoping that Ushiwakamaru is the real deal when I go back to confirm. Still to try are the others in the Yelp Top Ten...

2008-05-14 09:34:00
C, I guess we just have different taste. I actually love the freshly squeezed lemon juice with a little sea salt on the appropriate pieces and I also prefer that my sushi and sashimi not be giant slabs of fish. If you're looking for quantity, I suggest Funyama (24 Greenwhich Avenue)which has fresh and large pieces of fish. Not a pretty place though. I know you're not going again but for anyone else concerned about price, Omakase is expensive anywhere, good or bad, but I keep costs down at Sushi Yasuda by ordering a sushi sashimi combo (4 pieces of sushi and 3 types of sashimi and 1 roll, you choose the sushi pieces and roll off a list and it includes soup or salad)for $22.50, then I add a few more pieces, always the peace passage oyster and 2 or 3 more of Chef Tomura's choice...my meal is always under $50.
C
2008-05-15 01:34:00
Don't get me wrong -- I'm not all about volume. But when the fish is cut so small and thin, one struggles to taste the fattier fish. After all, isn't fat content what folks in Tsukiji pay a big premium for? But in terms of taste, this reviewer sums it up for me:"They were going for fresh and not fatty..."Nevertheless, there were pieces I had enjoyed, like the mackerel. One more thing about Yasuda -- and that's it has a large variety of sushi.I'll give Funayama a try when I want to test my appetite!I had thought Ushiwakamaru was pricy (not big pieces, and not as small as Yasuda), but some of its pieces made me change my tune.Almost no more time for NYC sushi this month... I'll see in a couple weeks how Tsukiji is!

C, I actually think their fatty tuna is wonderful...and if you ever go back, the cheek of the fatty tuna is sublime. We brought 2 of Lon's co-workers last week and Melinda kept wanting more of the cheek.Still, fatty or not aside, freshness is paramount in raw fish for me.

Carmine's Pizzeria
CONTENT
During the Bike Tour on Sunday, we took a little detour for lunch, and headed to Carmine's Pizzeria Carmine's Pizzeria, a regular looking pizza joint, a bit cleaner, possibly newer, than most. They've got something for everyone, thin crust, thick crust, Sicilian, stuffed, chicken, pepperoni, and spinach rolls in large and small, pastas, and salads, desserts, I'm probably missing some stuff. On Scott's recommendation, I got the Grandma, a Sicilian slice with tomatoes and cheese. The sauce and cheese was fresh and divine. I only wished the dough had a bit more flavor. Angie gave me a piece of her Sicilian with Sausage and that too was delicious on top. The crumbled sausage among great sauce and cheese was heavenly, again wishing the dough was a bit better. It wasn't horrible though. I've been trying so much pizza lately that I'm just being picky.I also had a small Spinach Roll which was stuffed with filling and generally pretty good, but not memorable. Scott and Sara both got pepperoni rolls and were moaning with pleasure.So Carmine's isn't perfect, but it's still a damn good place for their prices. You wouldn't need more than $5 per person here. We topped off with a $1.75 nice cappuccino as well. I'd come back if I was in the area but I probably wouldn't travel for it.*note - pics are from Angie's camera

Waldy's Wood Fired Pizza & Penne
CONTENT
Waldy's Wood Fired Pizza & Penne Waldy's Wood Fired Pizza & Penne is what you get when you attempt to turn thin crust pizza into fast food. The prices are lower than the other thin-crust, sold-by-the-pie joints, in return for busing your own tables and a lower quality of food.We tried the Classic Margherita which was uninteresting in flavor. The dough is crispy but has zero elasticity, which basically makes it a cracker with sauce and cheese.The Braised Lamb, Roasted Lemon & Oregano Pizza was more interesting (because I've never had lamb on pizza before) but not appealing enough to come back for. Again, the dough is the real put-off, hard flat, cracker bread.They also have Wood Roasted Penne's that they call Mac & Cheese. We chose Sausage & Broccoli Rabe which was served in a container that made it look like a frozen dinner. Although there is cheese on top, it doesn't really classify as a Mac & Cheese for us. It was crumbled sausage with pieces of broccoli rabe, in a very wet sauce. You can see the watery stuff pooling on the bottom. The penne was nice and al dente but as a whole, it only tasted a bit better than it looked which, as I mentioned, was like a frozen dinner (or airplane food according to Lon).The worst part of the meal was the Garlic and Salt Roll for 75 cents. We wouldn't eat this if it was given for free. It was one of those mediocre dry rolls you get at a bad catering hall, with some garlic powder sprinkled on top.The meal was cheap so I'm not going to complain too much but I have no interest in coming back.

I Attempted to Make Kalbi Tang
CONTENT
I'm not Korean but boy do I love Korean food. I get serious cravings for Kalbi-Tang and Duk Mandoo Guk when I'm sick. Unfortunately, my favorite place, I called the Secret Korean Grandma shop, closed, so I figured I had better learn how to make this stuff. I read a few Kalbi-Tang recipes on-line and ended up making it like this.Kalbi-Tang1. Soak ribs in cold water for an hour to get rid of excess blood. Change water if necessary.2. Boil ribs in unsalted water for 3 minutes. Drain.3. Place blanched ribs in 4 liters of cold water with black peppercorns, garlic cloves, and scallions. Bring to a boil. Skim off any foam that comes up and turn down to a simmer and continue cooking for 2 hours.4. Take ribs out and toss with soy sauce, sesame oil, black pepper, and minced garlic. Refrigerate over night.5. Strain stock, discarding peppercorns, garlic cloves, and scallions. Refrigerate over night.6. Skim fat off the top of the stock and bring ribs and stock to a boil. Turn down to a gentle boil.7. Take ribs out and place them in serving bowls. Beat the eggs and stir them into the stock.8. Season with salt and pepper. Ladle the soup into each bowl and sprinkle with sesame seeds.I'm pretty proud of my first attempt. It really came pretty damn close to what it should be. The meat was tender and actually more flavorful than the standard restaurant ones, but the soup is just missing something. Can someone ask their Korean grandmother what I'm missing? Please!

Try adding daikon, maybe that's the taste you're missing.  Either that or MSG, which is bad, but I'm sure some restaurant puts it in as the secret ingredient.  It's better if you do without though.Hakenhttp://www.whereyoulikeeat.com

Hi Haken,Try "Dashinomoto" plus the daikon. You'll find it in the Japanese section.  It's similar to MSG, but it's made out of bonito (fish) stock and NOT bad for you.  It's in almost every Japanese food item there is.

I've also had it with rice noodles in it at restaurants although it seems to really suck up the liquid.  i didn't do that to mine but this was my first attempt. also, a little msg won't hurt you, i mean 5 billion chinese people eat it every day in bulk.

You gotta simmer the soup more than 2 hours. It should be boiled at least for 4 hours. Then umami substances can be melted out from the inside of the ribs and the beef. That's why the beef tastes more flavorful than you used to eat.

Artichoke Basille's Pizza
CONTENT
There's always a line at Artichoke Basille's Pizza Artichoke Basille's Pizza and I've been meaning to check it out. They don't deliver and they don't have seats, barely enough counter space for 3 people to eat standing, they don't even have set hours. What is the draw? If you've been reading this blog for a while, you'd know that there isn't any really good pizza near 14th Street so my hopes were high. I NEED a good pizza place near me.So Angie, Angela, Kasi, and I bought 2 large pies, one Neopolitan, and one of their special Spinach Artichoke Pies to split, each getting 2 slices of each. (Each of their slices counts as 1 1/2 -2 from your average pizza place.) They gave us extra boxes to split them but it does take a while for them to make so by then Kasi had to head home. The rest of us sat on a stoop a few feet a way, each with a box balanced on our knees, trying to eat the pizza with one hand, while holding the lid with the other.The Neopolitan ($15) has an excellent sauce, although a bit too much of it, which causes a major mess as everything constantly wants to fall off. The cheeses make a nice blend and the fresh basil stands out nicely. The dough on this one is mostly good but a few spots are too burnt.The Spinach Artichoke Pie ($20) has a thicker dough so I'm surprised I like it, but I do. The crust is wonderfully chewy with big air pockets. I don't taste much artichoke but the ultra creamy topping tastes like a creamed spinach topped with cheese. It's very unique and a decadent treat, but after one slice of it, you feel quite heavy.Both types are quite salty but still the best pizza in this area. It's not my favorite pizza (I love Numero 28 and Fornino) but a damn good deal. The pies are huge, roughly being equivalent to half the price of my two favorites.So, when I don't want to travel, I'll definitely come here for pizza again. But next time, I'm going to call my order in first. (The friendly guy taking the orders gave me the tip.) But I'll also have to convince Lon to sit outside on a stoop to eat with me because it doesn't taste quite as good reheated.*note - pics are from old camera

See, now I thought there was more than enough artichoke.  There wasn't much artichoke taste, but I don't think artichoke hearts have too much taste which is why they're so good marinated.  But the artichoke texture was not so great for a pizza topping.  The taste of the pie was good, like having Houston's spinach/artichoke dip on pizza dough.  But I thought the bottom of that pie was a bit too hard.The sauce on the regular wasn't falling off as much since it was cooler when I ate mine, but I didn't think the sauce was flavorful enough.  Which is weird because generally I'm closer to a 'super taster' so to find something bland is unusual for me.  The taste was good, but it was too light.It's definitely worth going to try the spinach/artichoke pie, but I'm glad I have Italian Village around the corner from home.

Lon's Clambake
CONTENT
I call myself an athlete, having been actively involved in sports since I can remember. Gymnastics, Tae Kwon Do, years of figure skating, track & field, 2 years on a dance team (hip-hop/break dancing), ran my first marathon in October, and I'm signed up for a triathlon this fall. When Lon and I first started dating, my mom was a little concerned that he wasn't the active type and occasionally friends ask too, if it has affected our relationship. Amazingly it never has and he has been more supportive then any of my jock ex-boyfriends, often coming to races, and flying to SF and getting a sun burn on his head while watching me run the Nike Women's Marathon.This Sunday, I rode in the Five Borough Bike Tour, 40 miles of fairly leisurely riding with friends and I thought, it would've been nice to have Lon along. At a rest stop, we started discussing dinner and it suddenly came to me, that I would really like to have a clambake as my victory dinner. So I called Lon and asked him if he felt like making us a clambake, and Clambake he did!When we got back to my apartment, it already smelled great. Lon was making a super version with Chorizo. He had pre-cooked the potatoes (ooh, I love the purple ones) and had the onions and chorizo going already.The immense amount of food had to be split into different serving platters. Here's the mahogany clams, mussels, chorizo, potatoes, and onions in a giant bowl.Here are the 1 1/4 pound (each) lobsters sitting on top of corn you can't see.Lon has also been thinking about Clams Oreganata for days so that got thrown into the mix. It was made in fat back and rocked! (While he was shucking, I stole one clam to eat raw. I couldn't resist.)We dug in like cookie monster, leaving very little behind.It was one of those ultra satisfying meals. You crave something and you get exactly what you wanted but better. As I licked my fingers I thought, this is way better than having a sporty husband, one that can really cook!

Update on New Yeah Shanghai
CONTENT
We just went to New Yeah Shanghai New Yeah Shanghai last night for my dad's birthday. It was my favorite place for soup dumplings for a long time but the reign has ended. Sadly, the dough is now thicker, the meat a bit stiffer. The dough on the pork and chive dumplings has gotten too thick as well. The other dishes we got were mostly too salty but still meets the average Chinatown standard, which is pretty good. But in the end, without the super soup dumplings, Lon and I agreed, they were no longer special. You could eat anywhere in Chinatown for a similar meal.We asked the host on our way out if the chef or owner had changed. He told us that the chef was the owner and nothing had changed. Perhaps it was a fluke but none of use were convinced that it was really the same place. All five of us noticed a difference and each of us had eaten here so many times.Let's take a moment of silence for the fallen soup dumplings.

Strawberry Whipped Cream Cake
CONTENT
It's Cinco De Mayo and my dad's birthday, occasion enough to make a cake. My parents are like most Chinese parents, not fans of most American desserts. They find them too sweet, too dense, and too heavy. I tried to make a cake that was more suitable for my dad's taste buds, a simple Strawberry Whipped Cream Cake. It's deceivingly light because the cake is actually a high fat cake but everyone was fooled, and loved it.Strawberry Whipped Cream Cake1 recipe of any 9″ butter cake (I used Golden Butter Cream Cake from The Cake Bible.)Topping1. Make 9″ butter cake and allow to cool.2. While cooling, toss 1 1/3 cup sliced strawberries with sugar, Grand Marnier, and lemon juice. Refrigerate for 1 hour.3. Refrigerate the mixing bowl and beater for 15 minutes or more.4. Place gelatin and water in a microwave-safe bowl. Let sit for 5 minutes.5. Microwave on high for 10 seconds once or twice, and stir until gelatin is dissolved.6. Cool to room temperature, 7-9 minutes.7. Beat sugar and cream until you can see distinct beater marks.8. While continuously beating, pour gelatin mixture in a steady stream into whipping cream. Add vanilla and beat until stiff peaks form.9. Strain the marinated strawberries and gently fold into whipped cream.10. Pour onto cooled cake and spread evenly over the top with an offset spatula. (Optional, whether you want to cover the sides or not. )11. Use remaining strawberries to decorate the top.12. Chill for at least 3 hours before serving.After I finished making the cake, I was sort of disappointed, thinking the cake was kind of boring and not special enough, but everyone loved it, eating more than they usually do of dessert. After each of us had a slice or two, there was maybe 1/3 of the cake left. Lon kept eating a little bit more, then a little bit more, and suddenly there was only 10% of the cake left. I guess it was better than I thought. It's kind of a variation on Strawberry Short Cake and sometimes, you just can't beat the classics.

Save in Bulk
CONTENT
We try to make trips out to Costco or BJ's so we can stock up and save money. Did you know you can also buy in bulk right at Whole Foods? I always buy 5 or more of the Fage yogurts when I go to Whole Foods and one time an employee told me that if I bought a case, I'd get 10 % off. So from then on, I always bought the case. It occurred to me that if I didn't know, others might not know, but now you do. Woohoo!

McDonald's Southern Style Chicken Biscuit
CONTENT
Avid readers already know that Jessica and I avoid most fast food like the plague. Just like the plague, sometimes one can't help but catch it. So when a coupon for a free McDonald's Southern-Style Biscuit made it into my hands, I was lured in. So this morning I went an extra block out of the way to pick up the gift from America's kitchen away from home.Mickey D's was damn fast. My hot sandwich was in my hands in about 45 seconds, just enough time to pull it from the deep frier, wrap it in wax paper to hold the oil in, and hand it over. The sandwich's flavor was pretty good. It is exactly what the picture above looks like: aggressively deep-fried chicken on a biscuit. While it tasted like fried chicken, it was somehow dry. And while the biscuit was decent, although salty, it was also dry and kept sticking to the top of my mouth.The sandwich already has 420 calories, 1200mg of sodium, and 20g of fat, but it needs a sauce. Just slather some mayo with cayenne pepper on it or something to avoid the dryness. If you're hankering for deep-fry at 8am, this is the sandwich of choice; otherwise, I suggest sticking with the Sausage McGriddle; it's the same calories, less sodium, and slightly more fat, but so much more flavorful and moist.Having not been in a McDonald's in -- who knows how long -- the first thing I noticed is that everyone in there looks like they are either construction workers or counter clerks somewhere. For the $5.80 everyone in there was spending for breakfast, do they realize they could walk into any deli and get basically the same food, but in larger quantity, including coffee for $3-4? $2 per day x ~250 work days a year = about a year of free cable? I guess that's not food related. So in other terms, that could buy them a KitchenAid Stand Mixer

I had one of these this past weekend. It needed something-sauce...something. Maybe they should have done a McGridler spin and had the "bun" be small waffles and then include a maple-y sauce. It would be like a fried chicken 'n waffles sandwich. As it currently is, it's just kind of strange to get for breakfast.

Pasta Tasting - Course 3: Good Old Meat Sauce Topped with Criminis
CONTENT
I wanted to end with a classic pasta dish so that it would satisfy what anyone would imagine as a pasta dinner. You can't go wrong with meat sauce! We happened to have a large amount of very lean sliced beef so Lon got to play with our new grinder attachment. Because it was so lean, I added pancetta to this recipe but I still think you should use fattier meat. I got to make mushrooms since Lon wasn't going to be home but I still chose to make it a mushroom topping as opposed to mushrooms in the sauce because I figured we would have left-overs, and Lon would want to eat it.Good Old Meat Sauce1. Heat a large pot on a medium flame. Add Pancetta and brown for about 8 minutes.2. Add onions and carrots and sweat for about 4 minutes.3. Add ground meat and stir until browned evenly, about 8-10 minutes.4. Stir in diced tomato, tomato sauce, crushed tomato and bring to a boil.5.Turn down to a simmer and add garlic and bay leaves. Cover and simmer for 2 hours, stirring occasionally. (Can be made a day or two before.)6. Remove bay leaves. Toss with any kind of pasta and serve.CriminisMelt butter in a large pan. Toss the criminis and garlic in the pan. Season with salt and pepper. Toss around until cooked through and tender. Place on top of the meat sauce.I served the meat sauce and criminis with 1 pound of thin spaghetti. We came very close to finishing the pasta.

Pasta Tasting - Course 2: White Truffle Laguiole Mac & Cheese
CONTENT
The cheese guy at Whole Foods suggested Laguiole, a French Cheddar-style cheese, and after my first bite, I was sold. It's perfect for eating alone, having so much flavor, sharp and tangy, fruity yet ashy, nutty, rich and salty, really distinctive. I decided to make it into a unique Mac & Cheese.White Truffle Laguiole Mac & Cheese6 ounces dry elbow macaroni (Barilla)5.5 ounces Laguiole, shredded2 tablespoons heavy cream2 teaspoons truffle oil (optional)1. Cook the elbows according to package instructions, rinse with cold water, drain, and set aside.2. Toss macaroni elbows and Laguiole in a 3 1/2 quart pot. Turn on a low flame. Add Cream and stir until smooth and cheese is completely melted. Stir in truffle oil. Serve.Super Easy! Everyone seemed to like it and the bowl was finished, although it wasn't that big of a portion. My verdict is that Laguiole has so much going on by itself, it doesn't allow the truffle oil to shine. While the truffle oil certainly doesn't harm the flavor, I don't think it is necessary for this dish either.

Pasta Tasting - Course 1: Wilted Spinach and Tomato Orzo Salad
CONTENT
Tomorrow, I'm riding in the NYC Bike Tour with a group of friends. So tonight, I had them over for a preparatory pasta dinner. The idea is to have pasta so I decided on a three course pasta tasting. The first course would be a salad, yet still a pasta, but proportionately heavier on the vegetables because two more pasta courses would follow.Wilted Spinach and Tomato Orzo Salad1. Cook Orzo to package instructions. Rinse with cold water, drain, and set aside.2. Heat olive oil in a large pan. Place spinach in the pan. Sprinkle with garlic and and 2 pinches of salt. Cover and turn off the heat. Let sit for 5 minutes.3. Plate spinach. Place tomatoes on top. Place Orzo on top of tomatoes. Drizzle with Cherry Balsamic and olive oil. Season with salt and pepper. Top with garlic cream. (I like serving it like this but it must be tossed before eating it.)This starter was a real hit, polished off in minutes. I'm definitely going to make this one again.

Moroccan Spiced Lamb Shoulder Chops with Mango Raita
CONTENT
Lon's friend Justin gave us some lamb shoulder chops the other day and I thought hmm, interesting. I had never had lamb shoulder chops before. I made them for lunch today and I'm hooked. It's a great cut of meat!!I needed to make a quick lunch with the 1/2 inch thick lamb shoulder chops so I decided to rub them with a Moroccan Spice Blend. Use a generous amount and then throw them on a the grill for 4 minutes per side (for medium rare).I served it with an amazingly refreshing Mango Raita which was perfect with the strongly spiced lamb. While I can't take credit for the recipes, I can take credit for the pairing. It was a such a great meal, you won't believe you made it in less than 2o minutes!

A New Potato Side
CONTENT
One night, a few weeks ago, as I was starting to fall asleep, an idea for a potato dish came to me. It was in thinking about some dishes for a mother's day brunch that's coming up. My sister, about to celebrate her first mother's day (thanks to my niece Sabrina), loves potato and a new recipes was called for. First step, two huge potatoes:Step two, wrap once in aluminum and bake at 350 F (with convection) for 45 minutes.Better wrap up a bulb of garlic and roast that too...Meanwhile, in another part of town, I cut about eight dried figs into quarters and tossed them into half a cup of balsamic vinegar, and heated over the smallest flame my stove would offer. 30 minutes later I had a nice reduction (the figs took a beating once or twice during the process).After 15 minutes cooling, they were still hot enough to be annoying, but not so hot that I needed medical attention. I cut the tubers in half and very carefully cut the meat out, tossing the meat into a sauce pan.About half an inch of meat was left on the skins, which were then sliced along the edge, to lay them flat. With a healthy pinch of kosher salt, a crack of black pepper, and a drizzle of olive oil, I popped them into a 500 degree oven for a bit over 10 minutes.While the skins were crisping I added a knob (one tablespoon) of unsalted butter, a 1/4 cup of heavy cream, plenty of kosher salt and some cracked, black pepper. I mashed and whisked the potatoes. Unfortunately, the potato meat was a bit undercooked, and didn't come out as smooth as I hoped. At least it tasted amazing.I also squeezed all the roasted garlic into about 1/4 cup of sour cream. I whisked for all I could to blend the two. It looked wonderful.I plated the skin, and then pressed about half an inch of mashed potato on top, smoothing it with a spatula (and my hands). I then drew a few lines of the garlic-cream in one directions; and a few lines of the fig-balsamic reduction in the opposite. The plate need a swirl or two of some extra balsamic (Jessica and I love the extra sauce).The taste was just about dead on! I call the new dish \"Potato Irony\". The goal was to put opposites into a single dish focused on potato. The bottom of the dish is the super crispy skin and a bit of meat that is crisp, atop that is a super smooth and creamy bit of the same potato. Then in one direction is the creamy, but biting garlicy cream; and in the other direction is the sweet but acidic balsamic. It really works (you can see the layers in the picture of the last bite, below).That said, it was my first draft of the dish, and Jessica provided some great feedback for my next attempt. First is that after removing the potato meat, I should cook it further (via boiling perhaps) to allow the mash to become much smoother. Then I should pipe the mash onto the skin. Another idea was to fry the skin before baking it. The goal would be to get the skins way crisper.\"Potato Irony\" took about 90 minutes in all and is quite work intensive, particularly for a side dish. Jessica and I agreed the resulting product, both in style and flavor, was much more appropriate for an upscale, almost brasserie-style dinner, than for a brunch. So this one will wait for another opportunity to shine.

Sheng
2008-05-03 20:19:00
In addition to cooking the potato meat longer, perhaps running it through a ricer or a tamis will up the contrast you're looking for between the crisp skin and smooth topping. And also increasing the amount of butter you use may be good. (can you believe Robuchon's pomme puree is almost 50% butter?!) If you're not looking to go the haute cuisine route, I can also envision this dish with some crisped meat (chicken skin crackling, bacon, pancetta, prosciutto) and chives. Nice idea!
Lon
2008-05-04 08:38:00
Sheng, good ideas!  Robuchon is insane, he is prototypical French cook; not that there's anything wrong with butter  (we have about 6 pounds in our fridge right now).  I definitely would've riced the potato, except, amazingly, we don't own a ricer!  That must be remedied.I love your idea for the toppings.  Actually, it'd be fun to include a few tiny piles or cups of some of those on the side, and allow the diner to add.  And, perhaps that would make it a bit more accessible of a dish?

Sushi Yasuda #8 and Still Going Strong
CONTENT
You probably realize now that Sushi Yasuda is a weekly ritual (see past posts) for me, and almost weekly for Lon. The biggest decision to make is how much of the meal to allot to past favorites, and how much to allot to trying new pieces. I have to have orange clam and peace passage oyster every week, I alternate a few other favorites, and I always try to get at least three new pieces. I thought they would've ran out of new stuff to throw at me by now but nope, not yet. Here's the latest pieces.Tamago, Japanese Omelet, is a little bit sweet, very light, and this one has a slight barbecued flavor on the surface. We both liked it and earnestly took a bite before taking a picture. Oops.Archtic Char has beautifully colored flesh, usually more vibrant than salmon (which it looks similar to) , but we both find it less flavorful than salmon. Trade-offs I guess but we both prefer salmon.I'm so mad at myself for not being able to remember the Japanese name of this Beakfish right now but here it is with it's distinct silver line down the middle. It is one of my favorites of the white fish family, which I usually find boring and sometimes stringy. This one has a firmer flesh, yet you can still bite through quite easily.Then Chef Tomura surprised us with some Beakfish skin, fried! Oh boy, Lon was excited. It's like a delicate version of chicken skins.Kanpachi, in the same family as Hamachi, yet so different. The flesh is way more firm, with a very smooth surface. I enjoyed it but I'm not sure I can really remember the flavor now.Being regulars has it's perks. Everyone knows your name and of course Chef Tomura gets to know your taste. Our wonderful waitress also knows that I drink tea and Lon prefers ice water. Sushi Yasuda has become a second home.

Glad you grew out of Tomoe, which isn't nearly as good as people make it out to be, or in my case, good at all. In fact, I never went back, and this was back in 2002 when it was better than it is now. Fresh does not always mean that it's good. You still have to try the stuff out in Seattle or better yet, Vancouver. Your friend(s) from Seattle can vouch for that. I'll be looking forward to my first Sushi Yasuda experience this weekend.

Got Fruit?
CONTENT
I've mentioned my favorite fruit stand before but I thought I'd remind you again since it's the season to be loading up on fruits and vegetables. They've expanded too, now taking up three times the space of the average NY fruit stand, on the West side of University Place, right below 14th Street. They have more vegetables than they used to, often carrying spinach, salad greens, and sometimes string beans or asparagus. Today, I even saw sun-dried tomatoes. The fruit is of course still there and you can't beat prices like these.Lately, their produce has been even better than before, which I noticed because Lon will often ask me, where did you get this fruit? He now knows, it's usually from this fruit stand. Recent awesome buys have been strawberries, raspberries, navel oranges, and campari tomatoes and mangos.To top it off, this fruit stand is run by such a lovely family. The mom Sarah (not there when I visited today) and her two sons, David (left) and Oz (right), are quick, friendly, and know their products. If you don't know how to pick a melon to be ready in 2 days, just ask one of them to pick for you. You won't be disappointed.Be warned, there always seems to be tons of people clamoring all over this fruit stand (unlike some very lonely fruit stands I see everywhere else), which means that they sometimes run out of products by later afternoon. Amazing right!

gak, i'm so jealous!  there are no fruit stands within an hour's drive of me, and that's a major stinker.  i got spoiled on having fresh produce back home in virginia.  anyway, i love how you've established a rapport with the fruit stand guys!

Fornino Part II
CONTENT
I was back in Williamsburg today, apartment shopping, and couldn't resist having dinner at Fornino Fornino with my broker/friend Caroline. I guess that means I like the place. They do have an extensive list of interesting pies which draws me back because I want to try them all. Since Lon wasn't with me, I took this opportunity to try the Funghi Misti (mixed wild mushrooms, caciocavallo, mozzarella, white truffle oil). Caroline ordered the Gorgonola (gorgonzola, mozzarella, caramelized onions, rosemary).I could smell the aroma of truffle oil and gorgonzola when the pizzas arrived and my nose was in heaven. After I snapped a few pics with my old camera (It was supposed to rain today so I was afraid to take the fancy one.), I bit into a slice of the Gorgonola (top left slice) first. Wow, wonderful flavors, all balanced nicely. I loved how the cheeses were all very melt-y and oozy.I also enjoyed my order, with all the mushrooms I have missed (Lon doesn't eat them!). I was so excited to try the caciocavallo but it didn't add anything for me, and actually, I didn't like the texture of it. The browning of it in the oven, seems to have toughened the cheese. Luckily, it wasn't too distracting either and the dough really shined! It was superb, crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside.We also tried two flavors of gelato and one sorbet. The Fleur de Latte, a milk gelato, was smooth and creamy, a wonderful basic flavor. The Rosemary and Honey (it had a fancier name that I can't remember now) was very distinct, and a nice balance between the rosemary and honey, but it didn't really work for me. I guess I'd just prefer my gelato without rosemary. The Sicilian Blood Orange sorbet rocked! You could taste the freshly squeezed blood orange juice, very refreshing.As with most pizzas, the first two slices taste way better then the last two because it cools down from it's optimal temperature. I'm so going to keep complaining about this because it's one of my biggest disappointments in life. These pizzas were more filling than the Margarita DOC I got last time, but I think I like the classic one more. I still liked everything enough to know that I will be back for sure.I know some of you are wondering how I compare this to Numero 28 and I think they are different, so I can't really compare but let's just say for now, they're both worth traveling for!

When I order pizza in, I always leave my oven on. Before I eat my second slice, I pop the third slice into the oven so it's piping hot by the time I'm ready for it. I frequently end up with the skin from the roof my my mouth burning off, but it's so worth it.hmm.. when you're out, maybe some places would be willing to put the rest of your pizza back into the oven while you're still eating your 1st or 2nd slice.

Mocha Cheesecake Brownie Bars
CONTENT
Lon's co-worker Marcos gave me his old bike when he bought a new one. This is a life-saver for me since I'm riding in the NYC Bike Tour this Sunday. If you haven't noticed, I often show my gratitude with food. These Mocha Cheesecake Brownie Bars are just layers of good stuff, brownie bottom, mocha cheesecake middle, and sour cream topping. Sweets for the sweet! Thanks Marcos!Some notes:1. The recipes calls for a metal pan. My 8×8 is a glass pan so you can adjust for this by lowering the temperature roughly 25 degrees F and it may have to bake a little longer. Watch it carefully.2. The hardest part about this recipe is removing it from the pan. I'm not sure if the metal pan would have made it easier but I doubt it. I would use a sharp knife to cut around the edges and to cut into bars, while dipping in very hot water in between. Then use an offset spatula to carefully lift each piece. You will likely loose the first piece. Don't worry, delicious casualty..it became my breakfast.3. I suggest serving with strawberries or raspberries. The colors and flavors work well together. Enjoy!

I like my "perfect" eggs with a bit more consistency to them and less like a risotto. Since I won't know till I try, I'll cook this sans the cream. If I want a risotto-like breakfast, I'd opt for congee. The way of cooking eggs in the video is very similar to what I had in Vienna at Buffet Trzesniewski. See: http://www.sapdesignguild.org/community/images/Fotostory/Pfiff.jpg And yes, it was good.

Colorful Quinoa Salad and Skewers
CONTENT
Quinoa is a wonderful ingredient, that can be used as a substitute for rice or cous cous in most recipes. It is high in protein and has many health benefits. The best part is that it tastes good. I love it because it's chewy and the mild flavor takes on any sauce or dressing well. In the Spring, I love colorful salads and Quinoa makes a lovely one.Colorful Quinoa SaladDressing1. Cook quinoa according to package instructions. Set aside until cool.2. Whisk dressing ingredients together and set aside.3. Toss quinoa, edamame, cranberries, carrots, and cilantro together.4. Pour dressing on top when ready to serve and fluff with two forks.I served the Colorful Quinoa Salad with grilled skewers of shrimp, Chorizo, and Morcilla. Delicious and so easy! These ingredients work well together on a skewer because shrimp cooks very quickly and the Chorizo and Morcilla (from Despana) are already cooked so they just need to be heated.

Man this stuff is powerful. Look how clean my stove is! I'm sorry I didn't have the foresight to take before pictures, but if you cook often, you can use your imagination.It's also possible that Marcela is much better than the first cleaning lady we tried but she says Easy Off is good stuff, and she should know.Hallelujah!

I crave these Latin-style beans every once in a while. The flavors come together so nicely and its pretty healthy too. I usually make these beans with bacon but I have chorizo in my fridge so why not.Roasted Poblano Black Beans1. Heat oil in a small saucepan and add onions. Saute for 2 minutes.2. Add garlic and roasted poblanos. Saute for another 2 minutes.3. Add Chorizo and stir for another 2 minutes.4. Add beans and 1/2 cup of water. Bring to a boil.3. Turn down to a simmer and cook until the liquid is absorbed, stirring occasionally. This will take about 45 minutes.4. Stir in chopped cilantro right before serving.I often serve this as a side, the common rice and beans combo, but tonight, it makes a great filling for a burrito. I just layered rice, chicken, and the beans on a tortilla, and rolled it up. Any left-over beans can be refrigerated and reheated.

Thanks wildlilli!I always have a medium grain rice (from the Chinese stores) in stock, which is used here, but we also buy other specialty rices occasionally.If you steam or use a rice cooker, it will taste like Chinese rice. If you cook it Paella style, or pilaf style, it does come out very differently.Dr. Food, I think this is one of those recipes where you can play with quite a bit and it will still taste good. Without roasted poblanos, you will be loosing one of my favorite flavors though.Grace, I'm totally with you.

Bittman is an embarrassment to the food community.  His recipes are poorly written and his personality is annoying.  His entire approach to cooking is pathetic.  When I can stomach watching his show "Bittman Takes On...", I do enjoy watching the real chefs all but make fun of him for not knowing how to cook at all.

Cabaret Gourmet
CONTENT
We told you last week, we'd be going to Cabaret Gourmet, so of course I'm rushing to post our thoughts on the food. In general, each restaurant's table was set up beautifully and there was plenty of wine/alcohol. (Lon and I are not drinkers.) There was a comfortable amount of space so that you wouldn't feel cramped and you never had to wait on a line to sample the food, but the event was a bit smaller than Lon and I expected. There was 10 featured restaurants/chefs and they were all very different which made it more fun. The food was generally pretty good but nothing that made me want to run to the restaurants. (Also, I've mentioned before with other food events that I don't think the performance at an event is indicative of the restaurant's food.) Never the less, here's what I thought:Angus Mcindoe managed to serve their Cassoulet nice and hot. The beans were all nicely cooked but there was only one piece of chicken and one piece of sausage, making the balance a bit odd.Butter served a Truffle Mac and Cheese with excellent, well-balanced flavor. It was a bit too wet and the macaroni was too soft, but they could easily remedy this dish into something magnificent.Back Forty served Duck Meatballs with Asparagus and Orange Sauce. They were very tender but the meat was a bit gamey.Devi Restaurant shaped these piles of Bhel Puri, which I liked. It reminded me of when I used to eat dry ramen right out of the bag as a kid, except this had the tamarind sauce on it.Graffiti enhanced Paneer with pickled mango. It gives it a nice tang but I'm still not a big fan of paneer (one of my least favorite of cheeses).Gramercy Tavern made a chocolate cake covered in gooey nuts, very reminiscent of something you'd make out of box mix, without the artificial taste. Lon was a huge fan of this tender cake.Chef Michael Hu of Hana Pastries is one smart dude. He left his adorable son to man the table, plate the desserts, and answer questions. Gosh, this boy was cute, and he plated the desserts well.The pastries were beautiful and quite unique. I tried a Chocolate Layered Cake with a hint of lime. It was a lovely display of textures and I always love a bit of tartness. That's why I liked the Lemon Meringue Tart too.This cookie bottom was hard to break through but it was wonderfully light with an interesting tart center.Il Gattopardo served a Spec Salad with Lemon and Oil and Spec with Red Chili. I liked both, simple and tasty.They also served a Cabbage Wrapped Meatball which we found very dry.That isn't our main concern with Il Gattopardo though. While everyone else was gracious, this table was snobby, not wanting to waste their time to describe what they were serving to us. We both felt as if they didn't want us to eat their food. So fine, I'll remember that you don't want me to go to your restaurant.Pera Mediterranean Brasserie gets points for most interesting dish, a Beef and Bulgar Tar Tar, generously spiced. They served it in nice lettuce leaves with a spritz of lemon and oil. Pretty refreshing.Spec Alto Adige IGP & Asiago DOP displayed samples of their products, both good ones. I would buy them.It was a nice and enjoyable event, pretty relaxed, and the food was mostly pretty good. If you would like to support theater, you should consider this charity event for next year. If you drink alcohol, you'll likely get your money's worth.

Terry's Dark Chocolate Orange
CONTENT
Lon and I are not a big fan of chocolate and orange paired together, so when I was given a Terry's Dark Chocolate Orange , I was reluctant to try it. I've heard of it's popularity but still didn't think I would like it. I finally opened it today.First, I love the packaging design. It's a bit small to see, but it says, \"Whack & Unwrap\". I think you are supposed to slam the ball so that the segments break apart. As you can see below, I was hesitant in my whacking, so only a few pieces loosened.You eat the chocolate in segments, very cute and perfect for sharing.I have to admit, I like the taste. It is a bit sweeter than I expect of dark chocolate but the orange oil is balanced nicely so that it is not over-powering, and the texture is smooth enough, resulting in a product well worth it's very inexpensive price (under $2).

The E Award!

I am so so flattered to be presented with the E award by Ingar at Taste Memory. I aspire to take photos like hers one day. The colors and clarity is always amazing, looking like paintings, too perfect to be real. She is a great inspiration for healthy eating, and will make you want fruits and vegetables. As the name of her blog eludes to, she often tells great stories when different foods evoke memories (which there is now a scientific explanation for) from childhood.I believe I am now supposed to pass the E award on to my favorite food bloggers so here are the ones, besides Taste Memory, that I read regularly: Midtown Lunch is written by a cool dude named Zach who I'd love meet and eat with one day. We seem to have different dining styles and I'm not in midtown that much, but I can't resist this site as it does what it strives to do so well: talk about midtown lunch (they did just recently add a downtown correspondent though). If you work in midtown, you've gotta be reading this blog already, but if for some reason, you aren't because you've been under a rock, you're probably missing out on some good stuff in midtown. Cupcake Bake Shop by Chockylit (Cheryl Porro) is all about really inventive, and some classic, cupcakes. The pics and detailed instructions are great! I've used this site for inspiration many times.Foodie NYC is written by chef Joe DeSalazar who holds intimate tasting events for no more than 20 people at a time. We haven't had time to go to an event yet but hope to soon since the food he blogs about looks and sounds so good.Salty/Savory/Sweet is a totally casual, no pretense, food blog written by someone I've known for about 15 years. She is seriously the best writer I know and I would read her blog no matter what the subject was, but lucky for me, it's food! She takes great photos too! The Hungry Hedonist is Lon's pick. He recently sent me a link to this blog, written by a college student named Jen, who is a sophisticated and well-traveled diner. I'm super jealous! The photos are great too. Take a tour.

Wildwood
CONTENT
Wildwood Wildwood, the latest notch on the B.R. Guest belt, is a welcomed BBQ addition to our neighborhood. My friend Angie accompanied Lon and I to this well designed space where everything simply made sense: the country music, the aged windows above the bar, the fun t-shirts on the wait staff, and the barn latches in the bathrooms.We started with the recommended Bottle Caps, beer battered jalapeno slices, a simple and delicious appetizer. I'm surprised I haven't seen it done before. The ranch dressing was also excellent, wonderfully cool and creamy, off-setting the heat that builds slowly.The Chipotle Raspberry Chicken Wings were also a hit, very crispy on the outside, tender on the inside, and the sauce was a perfect balance of salty, sweet (not too sweet), and just a little heat.This being our first visit, we completely over-ordered, 2 rib samplers, and one other mixed sampler, each with two sides. It barely fit on our table but we were well prepared to feast, with paper towels, a clothe towel, and moist towelettes. We thought that was brilliant of management because you'll need it! The rib platter was generally very popular with us, smoky beef ribs, nicely rubbed pork ribs, and the really unique lambs ribs (which none of us have seen before). Lon wasn't a fan of the enormous amount of fat on it, but Angie and I didn't mind cutting it off to get to the tasty and moist meat. (Sorry for the dark pic.)The other sampler platter wasn't as good. The chicken was dry, so was the brisket, but the pulled pork was good. (Sorry for the bad pic again.) Our waitress reminded us to try all the house-made sauces on the table and it's definitely a life-saver for anything dry. We loved the Raspberry Chipotle Sauce and the Dirty Dick's Hot Pepper Sauce. We heard that these may be for sale in the near future and we would definitely by them!We enjoyed all the sides but one. The sweet potato fries were one of the best I've had, managing to be crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.The Skillet Cornbread was a nice traditional cornbread.Lon kept raving about the not too creamy Creamed Spinach, that actually tasted like spinach.The Bacon Baked Beans were certainly tasty and again, not too sweet, when this dish often is.The peppery Onion Rings were super hot, crispy, and oddly juicy on the inside. Be careful as you bite in, cause juice spurted out of mine. Lucky for Wildwood, I care more about food than my shirt.The big disappointment was the Cheddar Mac & Cheese. We loved the idea of cornbread crumbs on top but the cheese mixture was powdery, tasting like a box mix that wasn't well dissolved.We were stuffed but really wanted to try a dessert. We compromised with our stomachs and ordered one to share, the Bourbon Banana Sundae. It was a very enjoyable dessert and fit the theme well, but not very memorable.There were a few disappointments but if you know what to order, it's a great deal. The staff is wonderful, the atmosphere works, the overly generous portions are priced well. We'll probably be back AFTER the wedding.

While I haven't tried every BBQ joint in NYC, I have tried quite a few, and so far, this is the best, by a wide margin, easily beating out Virgil's, Blue Smoke, RUB, Dinosaur, Dallas, Texas, Bone Lick Park, and others I've had.While Jessica and Angie didn't enjoy the brisket, I thought it was fantastic.  It was super moist and had great flavor.  The pulled pork was also well executed.In the end, the fried items (wings, bottle caps, and onion rings) were stellar.  The bbq entrees were better than NYC-average, and the sides were all over the place (I loved the spinach, passed on the mediocre beans, and laughed at the mac & cheese).Like other BR Guest restaurants, the price perfectly matched the value and the service was great.  I highly recommend Wildwood.

I'm so glad that you wrote about this place because E and I love BBQ and have tried a good number of the NYC joints, but seem to always go back to RUB as our fave. Next time I'm back, we'll definitely try this out... especially since we haven't had lamb ribs before either! Plus, I love how you described the sweet potato fries... sounds perfect to me!

Sushi Yasuda! (Says Lon Too)
CONTENT
This is our seventh installment on our favorite sushi restaurant -- Sushi Yasuda Sushi Yasuda (if you haven't already, make sure to catch article #6). To help provide further perspective for those of you not lucky enough to have visited Chef Yasuda's land of delicacies, I will tell you about my experience there.My taste in sushi is different than Jessica's in several ways. First, I prefer rolls: maki (the common, small rolls of nori and sushi rice), futomaki (the large rolls with unusual fillings), and my favorite, temaki (the hand rolls, typically in the shape of a cone). Not that I don't love sashimi (thin slices of fish without rice) or nigiri (fish atop a hand-formed bed of sushi rice), but I just love the mix of the nori (seaweed), rice, and seafood. Second, I prefer firmer flesh and fattier taste, with less brine. Salmon is perhaps my favorite, but I love fatty tuna, and other similar fish. And third, I tend to enjoy picking my own items, whereas, Jessica really enjoys omakase (Chef's choice).One of the best, non-food aspects of visiting Sushi Yasuda is sitting at the bar and watching Chef Tomura (and the other Chefs, including Chef Yasuda) preparing sushi. Watching them roll the nigiri beds, slicing fish, or carefully brushing sushi with their delicious shoyu (soy sauce) or wasabi is awe-inspiring. The precision is truly art.The art and tradition of sushi is a special relationship between itamae (sushi chef) and patron. When sitting at the bar, one can truly enjoy okonomi, the practice of ordering/receiving a few pieces at a time. This allows the itamae to gauge your taste preference and hunger. The style also emphasizes the focus on each morsel. Notice the precision cuts made in the kohada (above). Those slices allow shoyu to seep in and make chewing the fish easier, allowing the focus to be on flavor. Different seafood will receive different cuts depending on texture, or none at all. The tuna (left, below) has a single incision down the center, while the gensaba (on the right) has no cut.There were two types of fatty bluefin tuna listed on the menu. Chef Tomura explained that the latter was fattier; of course, I was sold. It was exceptional. The flesh was perfectly firm and the fat was distributed throughout the meat, so the whole piece melted in my mouth as I bit into it.On the right (above) is gensaba, a type of mackerel that blows away any other I've had. Japanese know how to work miracles with mackerel, an otherwise mediocre fish. When grilled and lightly seasoned, it can taste remarkable. But gensaba needs no more help than a few quick slices of a master's blade. It is fatty and fine, with just a hint of sea brine.Jessica and I usually have the Peace Passage Oyster, prepared nigiri style. What we hadn't realized is that what we were eating is a slice out of a much larger piece of meat (shown below, next to an uncut piece of bonito tuna for reference). Wow!Before wrapping up this post, the rice (for which Yasuda is famous) and the nori must receive a bit of attention. No one should think they have truly tasted maki unless having enjoyed a hand roll from Sushi Yasuda. A simple grilled salmon skin hand roll will forever change your impression about what sushi can be. Speaking of rice, as an example of the beauty and perfection behind the work at Yasuda, here is an extract from their website:

Cork Cup Sleeves
CONTENT
Caroline and I stopped in for a coffee break and enjoyed the window seats at Ella Cafe Ella Cafe. They have an outdoor patio in the back and their organic coffee was pretty good. It's nice and strong, but nothing I would travel for. Oddly, I will travel back for the cork cup sleeves (can you see in the picture?) which totally stole the show. Wow, these were way more comfortable than cardboard. I now regret not keeping it. It didn't seem to impact the prices much either.I looked up some info on these cork sleeves and they've been out for about a year. Wonder why this is the first time I've seen it.

Fornino
CONTENT
I was out apartment hunting in Williamsburg today and one of our appointments canceled last minute. I took this as a sign from a higher power, that I should stop in at Fornino Fornino for some pizza. Lon had heard something about being voted best pizza in NY on Citysearch.I ordered the small Margarita DOC, a pretty plain pie (the way I like my pizza) with Buffalo Mozzarella, parmesan cheese, sauce, basil, and olive oil. All the ingredients were top notch, fresh and flavorful, and I could absolutely distinguish each flavor and each texture as playing it's integral part in making this pizza. My one complaint is that it was a bit too wet. If you don't hold your slice perfectly horizontal, everything slides right off. That's not enough to hold me back from another visit though. I thoroughly enjoyed it.This $14 pie was a little pricey because I could eat two of them for dinner (I do have an enormous appetite for a 5′3″ Chinese girl) but if I end up moving to the neighborhood, I'm sure I'll be making normal visits.As for them being the best in NY, I'm not sure, I'd have to do a side-by-side comparison and try several different pies, but it is a contender.

I don't know if anyone else will find this funny but it was interesting enough for me to pull out my complicated camera (that I don't really know how to use) to take these pictures. I was walking home on Fifth Ave and realized that there was three ice cream trucks within one block from where I was standing. Here's the one parked on 18th Street (right off of Fifth Ave).Here's two in this pic: You can see the back of the truck parked on 17th Street, on the right, and part way down Fifth Ave, you can see the back of the other one, parked just north of 16th Street.I exercised applaudable restraint and did not by myself any ice cream!

I always find myself coming back here eager to hear about your food adventures. Mr. Softee is such a classic. However, what is your take on the frozen yogurt craze? Pinkberry, Flurt, Berry Wild... I went as far and doing some side-by-side comparisons. And I'd love to hear your reviews.

Thanks Ellen! I'm not such a big fan of the yogurt craze. I've only tried two though, Red Mango and Yolato (here's the review), and I generally don't like it because it's not creamy. It tastes like watered down yogurt that's frozen to me. Since you've done a side-by-side comparison, let me know which one you think is best and I'll give it a shot.

Hi Jessica,I have tried three frozen yogurt places: Flurt, Pinkberry and Berry Wild.Flurt (3rd Ave. between 22nd & 23rd) is my favorite. It’s rich and creamy with a wonderful sour yogurt flavor. Despite being creamy, it also comes off as refreshing and light.Pinkberry comes in as a very close second. I find it slightly less creamy than Flurt. They also make a green tea version which was very disappointing, even though I love green tea.Berry Wild makes two versions; creamy and icy.  The icy is not as creamy and has slight yogurt flavor. Overall this one just tasted watered down. The creamy version was too creamy and hardly has any yogurt flavor.So my final verdict is Flurt and Pinkberry are both fantastic.  And I’m never going back to Berry Wild. They all offer small samples to try before you buy.  And various fruit and crunchy toppings.

Sevilla
CONTENT
Lon's uncle Allan and aunt Heather have been raving about Sevilla Sevilla for a long time. We made plans to try it with our friends Sara and Eric, but it didn't meet our expectations. The corner space has an old-school charm, with charming old waiters, and possibly the same old customers since the current owners took over in 1962.The bread basket is just supermarket hero bread. There is a complimentary salad swimming in dressing that I could do without. The popular Sangria (we chose white) is nice but surprisingly light.We started with three appetizers which were mostly ok. The Little Neck Clams on the Half Shell were average.The Clams Casino were cooked correctly and possibly the best dish we had, but still completely forgettable. I already can't really remember a few hours later.The Broiled Chorizo was smoky but lacked the other familiar flavors, resulting in general disinterest from our table.Our entrees arrived in pots which I liked cause it kept stuff hot. Our waiter portioned rice and some Mariscada with Green Sauce (more like soup) on each plate, displaying their historic style. The flavor was fine but most of the seafood was over-cooked.The same goes for the Shrimp Ajillo, decent flavor, terribly over-cooked shrimp, again swimming in a pot of broth.The Paella a la Valenciana (lobster, chicken, sausage, seafood) was the most disappointing to me because it wasn't anywhere close to a Paella. Without even a hint of saffron, it's just rice with some chicken, sausage and seafood in a pot, again mostly over-cooked.The major pro at Sevilla is that they give huge portions of seafood for reasonable prices. The four of us coudn't finish three entrees. Unfortunately, they haven't mastered the cooking part and until then, Lon and I will not be back.

I'm so glad someone had the same experience at Sevilla! I went a few years ago based on tips and subtle nudges from friends when I was visiting NYC for business, and I left completely unsatisfied. All of the seafood was overcooked and tough. Now I don't feel like a jerk for shooting down the raves-thanks!

As the French chef I worked for used to say...Why do so many Americans like their food over-cooked?I can't understand it at all! Occasionally, when I order lamb or duck, a waiter will ask me apologetically if it's ok that the chef serves it medium rare. Of course its ok damn it! That's the only way it should be served!I can only imagine the frustration of chefs on a daily basis...

DON'T READ IF YOU HAVE NOT WATCHED YET!Lon and I are kind of disappointed that Jennifer got kicked off this time, not because we love her, we don't, but we thought Antonia or Lisa would get kicked off for basically disregarding the rules of their challenge: They were supposed to make Polish Sausage and just decided to make Chorizo instead. I'm already annoyed by how often people seem unable to follow the instructions at each challenge.There was one where you could only use a certain number of ingredients and of course someone had more. How hard is that to follow? I hope not kicking off Antonia or Lisa does not encourage further disregard for the parameters, but at least Ryan got kicked off for not making tail-gating food on the previous episode.A few side notes:Lastly, it seems that most of these contestants live in NY, hope no one comes to beat me up.

My favorites right now are Mark, Andrew and Spike.  I am pretty surprised Spike is still on considering how many mistakes he's had so far.  I think the reason I like those three so much is because they aren't the norm of whats usually on the show.  Andrew actually reminds me a lot of my brother(also a chef).  I might have to convince him to try and get on the show.I think Richard and Dale both stand a very good chance of winning the show, but their "I'm the best thing since steak marinade" attitude annoys me like no other.

My favorites are Mark, Dale (despite his ball grabbing argument, but since it was directed at Lisa, I didn't mind so much lol) and Richard.  But this opinion is subject to change considering the previews for next week.  If Mark was serious when he says, "I don't think Chef Tom likes me" I will be so disappointed.  That's so childish.Of the women, I like Stephanie and Nikki (who has no chance of winning).  I was hoping for a woman winner this year, and Stephanie's the only hope I've got.  Antonia I did like until her snobbery took over.Lisa should have gone, hands down.  I'm with you Jessica, the blatant disregard for the challenge is really annoying.

I'm with you too.  I mean, I'm sure Jennifer could have made a tasty dish too if she just chose whatever ingredients she liked.  I was so frustrated after the show.I like Richard & Dale too because they really go for it and don't play it safe.Mark amuses me, I don't think he's smoking so much as we're not used to someone so laid back here in the states.Nikki has been steady middle of the pack; since I liked the food at 24 Prince I'm hoping she'll start to shine.And thanks for the spoiler alert.

For a place called Cafe Grumpy Cafe Grumpy, the staff is quite friendly, and patient. Thanks for dealing with my questions and indecisiveness. They offer three types of coffees so I tried the Anjilanaka from Caranavi, Bolivia. It had a very nice aroma and rich flavor, but it was a bit acidic, just missing the mark for me. I ordered the Garden of Eden, their house iced tea, for Lon, since he's a no coffee guy. It was very strong so it was a bit bitter, but it was also fruity, definitely a unique flavor. He hated it, and I really liked it. Guess who finished it?

Hatsuhana
CONTENT
Hatsuhana Hatsuhana is packed with the business crowd at lunch time, on both floors, and oddly, sushi bar seats are all that is left if you come without reservations. The host in front apologetically asked if we would mind sitting at the sushi bar, and I was glad to take it, but soon realized why it is not as desired here. There is no interaction with the chef, who will answer questions if you ask, but go no further.The lunch menu offers a wide variety of sushi/sashimi/chirashi combos, all listed with calorie counts. I don't think I wanted to know. I was hoping sushi meals were almost negligible to counter all the dessert I eat. Still, the sushi is fresh and generously portioned, although nothing particularly memorable. I found it rather boring that my 4 types of sashimi and 4 types of sushi was delivered as the same 4 fish: salmon, tuna, fluke, and yellowtail, the standard bunch.No major complaints though. Service was courteous and I wouldn't mind going back for lunch, for the reasonably priced specials ($25 for 4 pieces sushi, 2 pieces each of 4 types of sashimi, choice of a roll out of about 6 , soup or salad).

Cabaret Gourmet Next Week
CONTENT
For foodies who absolutely must be in the know, let us help you: next Monday, April 28, is Cabaret Gourmet Cabaret Gourmet @ Metropolitan Pavilion, the fifth annual occurrence of the event and a must-go for those on the NYC food scene. CG serves multiple purposes -- all of which we support.First, funds help support The Play Company, an international theatre that develops and produces adventurous new plays by writers from all around the world. Works that come from The Play Company are distinctive and cover a broad range.Second, CG, this year, honors Judith Jones, a remarkable food writer (who inspires us), known for books like \"The Tenth Muse\" and \"The Book of Bread\".Third, and not any less important, CG features New York City chefs and restaurants. This year's chefs include Chef Jason Avery (Pera Mediterranean Brasserie), Chef David DeCarlo (Angus McIndoe), Chef Alexandra Guarnischelli (Butter), Gianfranco Sorrentino (Il Gattopardo), Chef Michael Hu (Hana Pastries), Chef Jehangir Mehta (Graffiti), Chef Nancy Olson (Gramercy Tavern), Chef Shannon Pacifico (Back Forty), Chef Suvir Saran & Chef Hamant Mathur (Devi Restaurant), and others.As you may know from Jessica's bio, she worked with Chef Jehangir Mehta and can attest to his skill. We're looking forward to seeing him again.Two years ago Cabaret Gourmet was held at the smallish The Public Theater and last year at the gorgeous, but mid-sized The Angel Orensanz Foundation. This year CG is showing off it's remarkable growth by hosting at The Metropolitan Pavilion.Cabaret Gourmet is set for Monday, April 28 from 7:00-9:30 PM at The Metropolitan Pavilion(123 West 18th Street, \"The Level\", 5th Floor). Tickets: $99; $250; $2,500 - $5,000 for VIP tables (10 pp). For reservations and information call Hilary Leichter at The Play Company at (212) 398-2977 or email hleichter@playco.org.

which would put us in India with our garam masalas and mustard up in our arms and those in the middle east with their chick peas and salad leaves too...but yes I guess Asian today largely connotes Far Eastern. In fact I often wonder about tags such as 'Thai' curry. There cannot, for example, be an "Indian'curry

You're right that it is not a technically correct term....hope it doesn't offend anyone.

No offense...guess it was the sociologist in me. Is it because the far eastern community is the dominant Asian community in the US? Is it that Indians are known more as Indian than Asians?

Asian Style Chimichurri Steak
CONTENT
I don't usually buy London Broil but there was a super good sale going on so I couldn't resist it for $1.99 per pound. So, I figured I would marinate it and then grill it for dinner tonight.Asian Style Chimichurrimarinade2 1/4 pound London Broil (I cut it in half because of the size of my container but you can leave whole.)chopped scallions for garnish (optional)Put the marinade ingredients in a blender and pulse a few times, until ingredients are well combined. Pour onto the London Broil and refrigerate for 24 hours or more. Take it out and let it sit on the counter for 1 hour before grilling. Grill to desired temperature. Remove from grill and rest for 5 minutes. Slice thinly to serve. Garnish with scallions (optional).How long you grill it really depends on the temperature of your grill and how you like your meat. I did it for about 3-4 minutes on each side, which produced a slightly under medium-rare (the way Lon and I like our red meat). We decided we both don't like London Broil but love this marinade. The sugars from the honey help with beautiful grill marks and the aroma is divine. I highly recommend serving this steak with the Spring Soba Salad. It's a perfect match!

That looks really good. I'm going to try that marinade. I love adding honey to marinades and sauces.I have a question. I have one thick sirloin steak left that I got from Costco that I need to cook tonight. I don't have time to marinade it and I like my meat seasoned and flavored. I prefer marinades because the flavors really get into the meat, but because of time constraints, I was thinking of maybe giving it a dry rub. Do you have a quick way to marinade a steak or a good dry rub recipe?
Jessica@Foodmayhem
2008-04-23 10:01:00
One way to beat the time crunch is to slice the meat first, then you can marinade it for just an hour or so, then skewer it like a ribbon.Or, try this rub (I used on Pork Tenderloin. It's more of a wet rub, not dry rub but works the same way.

Street Vendor Curried Squid
CONTENT
While I was growing up, my mother owned a little clothing shop, and she would refill her inventory every Sunday, in the Garment District on the Lower East Side. The area has changed immensely and most of the wholesalers my mom bought from are no longer there but I have vivid memories of these days. My brother and I would play hide and seek among the racks of clothes, boxes, and shelves until my mom would get annoyed and tell my father to take us. My father, who did not have nearly as much power as my mother, could only entice us to listen to him without promises of ice cream or food from the street vendors.We ate from tons of street carts during these Sundays for years and one of the things I craved most after we stopped going, was the Curried Squid. Just about two years ago, I asked my mom where to get this Curried Squid I missed so much and she didn't know. The cart we had frequented was no longer around.By a kind act of fate, I stumbled across an unlabeled street cart, on Pike Street just below East Broadway, after lunch yesterday. I knew the vendor had Curried Squid! I could smell it, and like my eight year old self, I walked up to the man and said, \"Ga-li Yo-Yu?\". He nodded and my face glowed. I bought a pint, stuffed to the rim, full of Curried Squid for $3.50.Where I went wrong, was reheating it at night for part of dinner, which made it chewy and a bit over-cooked. I suspected that would happen but I was just to full to eat it when I bought it. The flavor was still the fantastic flavor from my memories and I was still completely satisfied, savoring each bite, feeling like a kid.I highly recommend going to this street cart and trying this Curried Squid, something I've never seen at any restaurant. He will provide napkins and a fork, so just eat it right there!

Lan Zhou Handmade Noodles
CONTENT
This is my new favorite whole-in-the-wall. Lan Zhou Handmade Noodle Lan Zhou Handmade Noodle is relatively clean for a Chinatown dive, has a short and simple delicious menu, and stealth-like service. As soon as you order, it takes the chef (dressed like any guy you'd see on the street) less than two minutes to pull the dough into a few bowl of handmade (in front of your eyes) noodles. I tried to take pictures of this noodle magician, working his magic, but even as he slowed down for my benefit, I could not catch a good picture. I was seriously amazed.The first sign that you're in a ghetto, authentic noodle place is this set up of spicy oil, black vinegar, chili sauce, disposable utensils, and napkins. What made me incredibly happy was the plastic container full of pickled mustard greens (you can see a bit of it in the lower left hand corner) that I love throwing onto my beef noodle soup. Most of the time, I think restaurants don't give enough and here I can add as much as I want.As I suspected, their English menu does not translate correctly because my Beef Tripe Noodle Soup ended up being a Beef Oxtail Noodle Soup, which was not on their menu. This happens quite often in Chinatown. Don 't worry, it's just another sign of authenticity. I didn't care at all anyway since I would've eaten anything they gave me. I was sure I was in heaven. It was absolutely delicious and it was a huge amount of noodles. I generally like my noodles thicker but I am not complaining about these fresh and bouncy noodles, swimming in a hot and flavorful broth.Monica ordered the Beef Noodle Soup, similar to mine, but with chunks of beef instead of oxtail.We shared a plate of pork and chive dumplings. I generally prefer thicker skins but these were still delicious, with an exceptional filling.I was so full and felt like a fat kid finishing off cake with frosting smeared across the face. For $11 or $7 each when you include tip, I got fresh and tasty noodles with a splash of memories of home.

I really wish I could've fit in a hand-pulled noodle place or a ramen place during our food trip, but there's only so many meals in a day. Other food bloggers also like Super Taste (http://www.nycnosh.com/?p=225). We also went to Bo Ky last week, one of Elaine's favorite noodle places in Chinatown. I had the most amazing beef belly noodle soup. If you like gelatinous bits of connective tissue cooked into the broth for that amazing mouth feel, get that bowl of noodles. Best 4 bucks spent on our food tour. Lan Zhou will be on my list for the next visit.

Saturday Night Seder
CONTENT
Lon will write more on Passover details later since I am no expert on it. I'll just go over the food.The Manishewitz wine (always served at Passover) comes in tons of flavors. I really liked the Loganberry flavor but it was too sweet for me as these Passover wines usually are.Lon's mom makes tons of pickles, the regular cucumber kind, pickled miniature peppers, and my favorite, these yummy Pickled Zucchini Ribbons. She made them last year and I loved them so much that she made them for me again. They are curry flavored and sour, perfect accompaniment to fatty meats.Lon's mom also enhances the jarred Gefilte Fish by cooking it with carrots and onions. It makes a difference.I got to help out with Passover by making the salad dressing for this salad.Matzoh Ball Soup is already a favorite of mine, but Lon's mom makes an incredible one! She makes these noodles with egg and potato starch, and a a very fluffy matzoh ball.The Stuffed Veal looks incredible doesn't it?Lon's job at passover is to carve the meats. Mine is to eat the bones.Neither of us are fans of potato kugel.But we love the Bilkes! It's made with mashed potato and animal fat (this time it was veal), spread thin on a sheet and baked until crispy on top.I've never had tongue like this before. The Braised Tongue was a bit sweet and so tender, you could shred it with a fork. Delicious!Lon's mom is quite famous for her Klops. These are oval shaped meatballs with a clear chicken sauce.We are always stuffed at Passover but manage to rest and then start working on dessert. It's always a huge spread. Here we have a plate of different types of macaroons and honey cake.This Banana Orange Sponge Cake was light and fluffy, the way a sponge should be, but uniquely flavored. I'm impressed that there was banana in it yet it still aerated properly.What's a dessert spread without chocolate cake?My favorite in the dried fruit platter is the papaya.Lon's mom also made a great raspberry sorbet and lemon sorbet but my picture didn't come out well. My favorite dessert at Passover though is always the Mandelbrot. It's the Jewish version of Biscotti, but it's more moist, still fantastic with coffee. I ate too much of it.Again, Lon will write more about Passover when he puts up the post about Sunday's Seder. All I know is that the food is always good and I am always stuffed, returning home two pounds heavier.

Perilla - I Have Returned!
CONTENT
You may have noticed that I don't return to many restaurants often. Perilla is one of the few that I make this exception for, and since the menu has changed a bit since my last visit, I'll have to remember to make seasonal visits. We were in a group of seven this time, and I'd like to make note to do that next time as well. You get to try more dishes! With some repetition, we got to try 7 appetizers, 4 entrees, and 3 desserts.The Flax Seed Crusted Soft Shell Crab is a an absolute must have! The crust is crispy, the inside is meaty, it's not at all oily, perfection! The kimchee ramps are such a nice accompaniment and I wish I could buy a jar of the passion fruit vinaigrette. Everyone loved this appetizer so much that we ordered another one at the end of the meal, even though we were all full.The Shaved Artichoke and Fava Bean Salad was nice and light, and a very generous portion. The ricotta salata, fava beans, and almond vinaigrette worked nicely together, but I didn't taste enough artichoke.The Crispy Berkshire Pork Belly was well executed, a perfect juicy piece of pork, with the crisp skin, again not oily at all.The signature Spicy Duck Meatballs were not exactly the same as Lon and I remembered, still good but spicier, with more herbs, and the meat was packed more loosely. There was less cavatelli as well.The Cheeks Du Jour were Codfish Cheeks, perfectly cooked and laid on a fantastic salad with pickled golden beets.The Wild Bison Tataki was another favorite (and since most dishes were already really good, favorites means a lot). Each thinly sliced piece was full of juicy flavor, wrapped around baby arugula and sour gooseberries, a perfect combination.The Braised Octopus with Black Chickpeas (a special) was very tender but the flavors were not as interesting as the other dishes.Moving on to entrees, I didn't taste the Roasted Poussin or the Sheep's Milk Ricotto Ravioli. It seemed like people were happy with both.The Roasted Duckling was amazing, another must-have! It was a dish that humbled me because of the perfection it displayed, perfectly cooked and even throughout. The skin was crispy, the meat was juicier than I thought duck meat could be, and again none of it was oily. The mustard greens, barley, and pistachios with a white mulberry ginger sauce was the perfect accompaniment.Sadly, there was one dish I found disappointing, the Turbot (a special). It was over-cooked, making the normally very tender and flaky fish, rather tough in texture. The pairing of cherry tomatoes, asparagus, (some other vegetable that I forgot now) and pine nuts is very regular, unlike what I now expect from Perilla.We also ordered a side of Farro Risotto (forgot to take a pic), as delicious as it was last time. Cheesy, gooey, chewy, delicious. For dessert, we ordered two plates of vanilla scented doughnuts, which were good but a bit denser then last time. I prefer the lighter and fluffier.The Rhubarb Turnover and Buttermilk Ice Cream was good but not memorable. I would have liked more filling in the turnover.The Banana Hazelnut Tart was the dessert favorite, a wonderful layering of textures. The chocolate wafer-like bottom was airy and crispy while the milk jam and molasses ice cream was creamy and smooth. The fresh banana slices contrasted the thin banana chip, and all of it tasted wonderful together.Perilla ends your meal with a gift of little oatmeal raisin cookies, nice and chewy, a bit too sweet for me, but I think oatmeal raisin cookies are supposed to be sweet like that.With just one bad dish out of all the stuff we tried, I think very highly of Perilla. I am most impressed with their ability to make any dish seem not at all oily, even fried items or fatty skins.At around $60-$75 per person, including tax and a generous tip (for our friendly and knowledgeable waiter), I can't wait to go back again. Remember, you have to order the Flax Seed Crusted Soft Shell Crab, the Wild Bison Loin Tataki, the Roasted Duckling, and the Farro Risotto.

Jess, excellent review of the meal...the poussin was a little underwhelming, though when I switched plates with Elaine mid-entree, it had already gone cold. You didn't miss much by not trying it. I'm still thinking about the duck -- I don't know how they cooked it so perfectly, with the crisp skin, and medium-rare doneness throughout the entire cut. It was so nice to finally meet you and Lon in person! And thanks for the delicious espresso walnuts!

Taste Memory, I do think you should stop by Perilla on your NY trip. Are you still coming in May? How long will you be here? Make reservations for Perilla at least 1 week in advance.Sheng, Lon and I were so happy to have met you as well. Can't wait to meet up in Chicago!

Jess - love the pictures form the new camera.  Definitely a vast improvement.  Oh man, you got every dish's description right on.  I tasted the ravioli and it was very well-seasoned and the shell was very tender which I liked.  Not sure if it was worth $23 though.  I think my favorites were the soft shell crab, the duck and the tataki.  I was not impressed with the spicy meatballs =(

That was one great meal. Everything (except the Turbot) was yummy to my tummy. I loved loved loved the soft shell crab. I find that eating out these days, most dishes are pretty uninventive, but at Perilla each dish had unique pairings of flavors that I really enjoyed.I would like to add that I really liked my glass of Monastrell from Jumillia. Its a medium bodied red that is sweet with hints of berries and a bit of spice. It was very easy to drink and well priced at $8/glass.Besides the Turbot being a disappointment, my other complaints include the lighting that was a notch too dim and the music that was a tad bit too loud.I feel like there are plenty of restaurants that have well prepared food, but if you add on being inventive, and having affordable prices, that is a rare find. Luckily, we were able to find all these things at Perilla. I can't wait to go back. I think it needs to be before the end of soft shell crab season though.

Candied Espresso Walnuts
CONTENT
We were having Friday night dinner with some friends and I wanted to bring something, like a little gift. I figured we would probably want dessert at the restaurant, so I didn't want something that had to be eaten right away. I found this quick and easy recipe for Candied Espresso Walnuts which made fantastic little goodie bags, that could be taken home and eaten later.

Chorizo with Honey and Almonds
CONTENT
To break in our first alfresco meal of 2008, Lon made this incredible appetizer with the chorizo he bought from Despana. It includes chorizo, toasted almonds, honey, finely chopped onions, and thinly sliced miniature sweet peppers. I've been pestering him about writing down his recipes because sometimes he makes amazing stuff! This was one of his best, one of those dishes where you can't believe something this simple, tastes that good! After Passover, I'm making him write a recipe for this.

Financier Patisserie
CONTENT
Last night, Angie brought over very pretty desserts from Financier Patisserie Financier Patisserie, which I should not have eaten! The crowd favorite was this dark chocolate mousse-like square, with a white filling/paste of caramel consistency. The texture was ultra smooth and melts in your mouth. I would've preferred it without the white filling (too sweet for me) but Lon was licking the gold paper it sat on.The Fraisier, mostly fresh strawberries and mousseline, and barely noticeable biscuit (type of cake), was light and reminiscent of the desserts from Chinese bakeries (says Angie and I completely agree).This Blueberry Lemon Tart wasn't enough blueberry and no one liked the crust, which had a weird wet inside. The top was a nice light lemon mousse (seemed to have added gelatin to hold shape), not too tart, not too sweet.The Chocolate Praline Cake was a pretty standard, dense chocolate cake.Generally, I liked these little cakes, mostly because they weren't too sweet. The prices are reasonable, and they are quite beautiful. It doesn't compare to the stuff I had in Vienna though.

This is not the best thing to be eating 6 weeks before your wedding, but I had most of the ingredients for Enchiladas just sitting in my fridge, waiting to be brought together. It turned out scrum-diddle-ee-umptious!Beef Enchiladas in Green SauceIngredientsInstructions5. Roll up tortilla. Place seam side down in 9”X13” baking dish. Repeat with remaining tortillas, cheese and meat.6. Stir sour cream into green sauce; pour over enchiladas. Sprinkle with remaining cheese.7. Bake until cheese melts and enchiladas are heated through, about 25 minutes.Don't worry mom. We had some salad too.This recipes yields a very creamy dish, without being at all oily. Lon and Angie both looked very happy as they took second helpings.

I would like to confirm the deliciousness of these enchiladas. I liked them because the tortilla wasn't soggy like most enchiladas I've had, and the green sauce was a nice change from the typical red sauce. Even though I'm suppose to be cutting back on my food consumption, I couldn't resist a second helping.

We absolutely love receiving feedback from readers, positive or negative. Both help us improve the site. You may have noticed some minor improvements recently, all of these have been in response to reader feedback.Angie pointed out that sometimes comments reported names as \"anonymous\" even when the commenter used their name. That problem is now solved.Kasi suggested that having a \"jump to comments\" button on post pages would make it easier than having to scroll down to the comments section. Great idea! That is now added.We've also gotten feedback about problems with the search box often linking to missing pages. We made some changes and think that should be solved now.But more than any other feedback, we've been advised to get better pictures. Most of our pictures are either from our camera phones or from an old Casio Exilim point-and-click camera. Well with great recommendations from various readers including Bill, Steve W, and Steve K, Eddie, and a whole lot of research, we have purchased a Canon EOS XTi, a few lenses, a speedlite, and other accessories. As of yesterday most of our pictures will be from the new camera, and hopefully substantially more enjoyable for you. (Here's where we sneak in a picture of our dog, Ice.)Thank you and keep the great feedback coming!

Sweet Cheese Puffs
CONTENT
Carol Gelles gave me a book called Sweet Miniatures, by Flo Braker, several years ago. It's possible that this book started my obsession with miniatures, after I bought a mini-muffin pan just to make the Sweet Cheese Puffs in this book. It is still my favorite recipe from this book, and occasionally I play with it to make different flavors.I decided to make two adaptations, one with Grand Marnier, for my friend Caroline's birthday (yesterday). The other with Mango Butter, which I made today. These are wonderfully light, which is so deceiving as this is not a dessert for dieters.Grand Marnier Puffs and Mango Cheese Puffs~adapted from Sweet Cheese Puffs by Flo BrakerSour cream pastryFillingDirectionsThese are beautiful little pastries that make great gifts. The mango flavor isn't as noticeable as I would like but the Grand Marnier version is fantastic! I'll probably continue playing with all the flavor possibilities of this recipe... next time matcha?

I think I may need to learn to make these. Besides me finding them very scrumptious, Scott loved the ones I brought back for him last night. He's normally not a fan of cheese, but he really liked these little pockets full of yumminess. They're not too sweet, flakey and moist all at the same time, and they're just so adorable. In terms of flavors, how about any kind of berry flavored ones or maybe guava or pineapple. There's also of course peanut butter.  Ohh....maybe you can put a savory cheese filling instead of a sweet one! That would be so yummy.
EAT!

Despana
CONTENT
Justin K. and I met for lunch yesterday in SoHo, where his new office is located. Our lunch venture started off quite poorly but ended up amazing. I spied L'Orange Bleue a bit east of his office; we walked over and found it to be closed... at lunch. Sad. So then we continued east, passing a little shop called Despana, on our way around the corner to Hoomoos Asli. I hadn't been there in years, but their food was always good.Nearly ten minutes after being seated at Hoomoos, Justin and I had to specifically call the waiter over to order. 35 minutes later, when another customer walked out due to the hour long wait for his food, we knew the prospects were bleak. I asked the waiter for an estimate and he said it would be at least another ten minutes -- for two shwarma sandwiches. We left. I recall now that the reason I stopped going to Hoomoos Asli was because of horrible service. Looks like it will be another few years before they get another chance.So we walked back to Despana Despana, which looks like an upscale, small Spanish Grocery. Inside, one first passes a case of cured meats, then a case of cheeses. In the back, there is a small area with a few stools and a counter to order quick bites. At said counter, Justin and I each ordered a bocadillo (a sandwich prepared on ciabatta bread) and a tortilla Española. Justin had the tortilla with manchego cheese; and I had the pintxo tortilla with shrimp salad. Both were delicious and surprisingly filling for no more than three bites of food (for about $5 each). It probably was the perfectly cooked potato in the omelette. We were impressed.As we waited about five minutes for our sandwiches Justin sipped his orange drink, I perused the meats and tasted some of their samples. It rapidly became obvious that I'd have purchasing to do after I ate.Our sandwiches arrived warm and fragrant and large. They were $8.50 each and well worth it. Justin found his Bocadillo Picante (chorizo picante, mahon cheese, basque guindilla peppers, tomatoes and olive oil) a bit too spicy, so he cleared off most of the peppers. I thought it was perfect. My Bocadillo Mallorquin, a simple spread of chorizo (sobrasada) drizzled with honey del Brezo (which I believe is a honey from heather flowers), was fantastic. We were stuffed.I figured it was safe to start shopping (they say, never shop hungry). I was wrong:I ended up spending almost $50 on a handful of items. After tasting samples, I couldn't resist:Ok, lot's of detail here, so let me sum it up -- go to Despana! Bring a wallet. Bring an appetite. Look for me there, because I will certainly be back.

Sushi of Gari 46
CONTENT
I had lunch with my friend Zoe at Sushi of Gari 46 Sushi of Gari 46, which was empty at noon but filled up around 1pm, in a sudden whoosh of people. I asked to sit at the sushi bar but that is reserved for Omakase only. When we opened the menu, we saw that there was a Lunch Omakase for $50 and we thought, ok let's go for it. I asked again to sit at the sushi bar but unfortunately, that omakase did not count.I decided on the Deluxe Sushi, which was 9 pieces and a roll. Zoe opted for Chirashi. Our waitress then asked, \"Would you like soup or salad?\" I replied \"salad\" and Zoe did the same. The salads were very pretty, with a nice dressing.Zoe's Chirashi was also quite pretty (sorry the pic was too dark) but my Sushi Deluxe looked pretty regular. The top four fish were fresh and above average but I was terribly disappointed that the scallop was cooked. The salmon had a lightly smoked flavor which I enjoyed, and the cooked shrimp (I don't normally care for in sushi) was cleverly poached in a broth, possibly fish and miso, adding flavor to the once flavorless. I had mistakenly saved the Uni for last, but it was only creamy, not flavorful. The Salmon Roe were a tad slimy.The highlight was the roll; I'm assuming it was toro. There was some scallion mixed in and the sushi rice was seasoned wonderfully, to the max amount of flavor without masking the fish. However, I'm surprised that this well-known sushi place has very average wasabi.While most of it was pretty good, neither of us were too impressed, resulting in a somewhat forgettable meal. When we got the check, it went from forgettable to a negative memory. They had charged us for the salad! When we inquired about it, the waiter said something condescending about how only cheap Japanese restaurants include the salad, not this place. We explained that our waitress had misled us by giving us both the impression that it was included. After all, if you just ask soup or salad...why not ask if we wanted any other appetizers? They had other starters to offer. Also, she asked us soup or salad after we placed our main course order, again, implying that it came with it as a choice. The waiter apologized half-heartedly and just walked away.Throughout this experience, I felt as if I was not welcome. So, feel free to go if you're in a suit, on an expense account. This ended up being a $50 lunch and it just wasn't worth it.

It's so funny! Or not, maybe. In the thirties and forties, the restaurants by Times Square were called "clip joints" where they would overcharge out of towners,tourists, and businessmen. Taxi drivers were kicked back tips and meals to drop off the unsuspecting. Happy to see that Gari is a traditionalist! I was supposed to go to the one on 78th street when it first opened. Never got there. You make me happy I missed it! They do have a way cool website though!

Sushi Yasuda Installment #6
CONTENT
I'm not bored of Sushi Yasuda yet, so last night was visit #6, with my darling, Lon, who has grown fond of being a regular too. If you just joined us recently, you can catch up by reading 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 since I now only post the new items I have not eaten before.Chef Tomura recommended that we try these Flash Fried Freshwater Miniature Crabs. They were the cutest little, nature-ready, bite-sized hors d'oeuvre, a crab chip. There was nothing mind blowing about the flavor but they were so perfectly fried so that you didn't notice any oil, and the seasoning was perfect.I know I'm too old to be playing with my food but this crab is totally in fighting stance! Of course, I won.Next, Sea Trout Sashimi, which has a beautiful multi-colored flesh, but is uninteresting to me in flavor, much like white fish.On the right, is Bonito, from the tuna family. It's similar to a good tuna, nothing distinct.On the left is muscle from the orange clam. It tastes just like orange clam but chewier, as expected of the muscle. On the right is Kuchiko, the guts from orange clam. It is reminiscent of uni because of it's creamy texture. It is sweeter and less briny, making it a good stepping stone to uni, for those less adventurous. Lon now favors Kuchiko, but I'd have to do a side by side taste test to decide for myself.The famous Toro oozes with fat juices when you place it on your tongue. It's just luxurious.Lon ended with salmon roe, so I stole a few pieces. Yum, the smooth egg breaks and the delicious liquid runs through your mouth, like a clean sea breeze at sunset.Another delicious, fun, and educational meal. Can't wait for our next visit!

Sushi Yasuda has set new standards of quality for me when it comes to sushi. Knowing that I can eat there affordably makes all other sushi places unworthy of visitation. I had sushi with Scott at Kanoyama last night and it was bad bad bad. The fish was not fresh and the proportion of fish to rice was horrible. I felt like I was eating a bowl of rice with some fish flavoring or something. Scott was completely dissatisfied and ended up eating a bowl of ramen when we got home. He admitted that SY was much better quality and even said he wanted to give it another try after last night's disaster. I'm hoping I can turn him into a SY regular now that I know how to order there without breaking the bank.

Hell's Kitchen
CONTENT
First, Lon and I love Gordon Ramsey, the Simon Cowell of kitchen reality shows. I wish I could just occasionally scream at some of the morons I've encountered and tell them exactly what I think of them.So, who picked the bozos on this season of Hell's Kitchen? None of the contestants show much potential and they look and speak like trailer park trash. Did they not catch on from other reality shows to throw in some eye candy? Matt resembles a Bull Terrier! (This picture of him is way too forgiving but I couldn't find any others.)We're glad Jason got kicked off this week. This sexist pig, who's probably never had a date, can only make gender related comments, or whine like a baby. He thinks the men should have won the chicken butchering contest purely because they are male. When he screws up making the desserts, he says he hates desserts and justifies if by saying, \"Women can make desserts.\" Meanwhile, he could barely memorize four freakin' desserts. Not the recipe of four desserts, just the names of four desserts with accompaniments. Apparently, memorization is a female job that men shouldn't be bothered with either. After getting kicked off, he walks off whining about how he can't cry because he is not a woman. Ok, manly man.We're hoping Jen gets kicked off next week, just because her voice is just that damn annoying, but it'll probably be another idiot first. It's hard to choose, there's too many. I'm not sure I'm going to continue watching this season of Hell's Kitchen. I enjoyed last season much more, when at least a few people had potential, so you had someone to root for.

Jess & Lon,I love the show, Ramsey's foul manner is just an act, right?  I mean it HAS to be!I know that kitchens have reputations for screaming and shouting, but I wouldn't work on a line for anyone that screemed at me like that.I couldn't agree more as far as being happy that Jason got kicked off.  At first, Jason's comments bugged me.  But
Lon

TroyBoy, I suspect that Ramsey's personality on his US shows (Hell's Kitchen and Kitchen Nightmares) are in fact similar to his real personality, but amp'ed up dramatically to play to the US audience.Have you caught his UK shows on the BBC?  He is much calmer, although still terse.I find him remarkable and would absolutely work for someone like him in a heartbeat.

I'm glad that Jason got the boot too. I thought that, in this day and age, we'd be past this whole sexism thing (at least I'd expect that people would be shamed to suppress the really blatant offenses), but I guess I was wrong sadly.I like Hell's Kitchen, but I think Kitchen Nightmares is better. Whereas Hell's Kitchen makes Ramsay look like a temperamental maniac, Kitchen Nightmares shows how savvy of a restaurateur he is. Quite impressive to see how he turns things around.If you think Ramsay's a beast, Bourdain says Ramsay's mentor, Marco Pierre White, makes Ramsay look like Santa Claus! He once dumped a hot pan of risotto onto the chest of Mario Batali, another one of his trainees.

Subtle Tea
CONTENT
I walked by Subtle Tea Subtle Tea today and of course, I wanted to check it out. It's a well lit space that fits one large communal table, a window seat, and a few side seats; all of it was full. Luckily there was no line, so I didn't feel bad taking my time at the counter. In terms of baked goods and treats, nothing looked enticing. The selection was rather bare. The focus is teas, where the list was so long, I needed direction. I asked the girl for a recommendation because I wanted to try something interesting, yet I'm not a fan of fancy fruity teas or minty teas (for hot tea). She described the Almond Cookies Green Tea because it is their most popular. I was hesitant but agreed and she started brewing a cup, offering to replace it if I did not like it. On my initial taste, I wasn't sure if I liked it, but after a few more sips, it grew on me. The Sencha green tea, grated coconuts, and almonds, were perfectly balanced, creating something exotic, not startling, and ultimately enjoyable. The prices were right so I'll be back. I only wish they were closer to me.

Red Jacket Orchards - Dried Crispin Apples
CONTENT
While I was in the Union Square green market yesterday, I picked up some Dried Crispin Apples from Red Jacket Orchards. They are regular in taste but what I like is that they are just Crispin apples, with nothing added. Often, when you buy dried fruit from the supermarket, there is added sugars, sulphites, or other chemicals. Less is more.

We tried two products from Fantastic Foods last night, the Hummus Mix and the Tabouli Salad. Both are inexpensive and couldn't be easier to make. Unfortunately, I can't recommend them.The hummus was edible for Lon and our friend Andy, but not preferable to any other hummus they've ever eaten. We agreed that there was a fake taste to it, that made it completely inedible for me.The Tabouli Salad was even worse. None of us could eat it and we all tried.Here it is, all in the garbage, wasting two perfectly good tomatoes.I've tried Fantastic Foods Taco Filling (Vegetarian) before and it was decent but don't buy the Hummus Mix and the Tabouli Salad.

How to Fire Roast a Pepper
CONTENT
Whenever friends ask me how I roast a pepper, it seems like they think it will be uber complicated. Well, good news, it's not! It's super easy and you do get something absolutely delicious and very healthy. There are different ways to roast a pepper but I like fire roasting, because it requires no pans, just your stove (if you have an electric, you're screwed) and tongs, and of course peppers. You can roast all different kinds (the same way) but my demo is with red bell peppers and when you're roasting these, choose nice thick, fat ones.Just turn your flame on high and throw them on. My flame is on but it doesn't show in the picture (someone scientific, tell me why).They will start to blister and blacken. Turn them so that the non-blackened part is closer to the flame.Continue rotating the peppers until the entire pepper is black.When they're done, turn off your flame, and throw them into a paper bag. Close the bag and let the peppers steam for 15 minutes. The skin will then come off easily by just rubbing lightly with your fingers. Remove all the skin. This does get a little messy.After the skins are removed, you can remove the stem and seeds. You can now cut into strips, cubes, or any other shape you want. I usually make several peppers and store them in halves or quarters in the fridge so that I can cut the shape I want later.If you're usually buying jarred roasted peppers, you will be amazed at how good freshly roasted ones taste. I add them to salads, sandwiches, sauces, and eat them by themselves. MMM....roasted peppers.

here's an interesting recipe from India for a popular dish called baigan bharta which is a form of smoked aubergine/ brinjal.Take a medium sized aubergine and make some slits on the skin.Then keep turning over the flame on a cooking range till the vegetable becomes soft inside. Take the aubergine out and put it under running water to cool it and then peel the skin.Saute some chopped onions, tomato and chillies in vegetable oil and then add the peeled, soft, aubergine to it. Add some salt and chilly powder and mass it with a ladle over a slow flame. Garnish with chopped coriander/ cilantro

Dr. Food, you have a broiler in an electric oven? Does it have flame? If so, yes, you can do it in the broiler. When you do it that way, cut  the steam and seeds out first, and lay them in quarters, skin side up.The Knife, I don't know what aubergine is.cooking, thanks for visiting!

POM Wildberry White Tea
CONTENT
While I typically enjoy water with my meals, from time to time, I grab an alternative drink from the deli shelves. Today I tried a new-ish flavor of POM Light Tea, Pomegranate Wildberry White Tea. I noticed it only has 35 calories, as it is sweetened with erythritol, a low-calorie, natural sweetener that is a non-alcohol byproduct of glucose fermentation, and is not known to have side effects.White teas are generally very subtle in flavor, which means they are a good choice for this type of a drink. It allows the fruit flavors to come through and avoids needing too much sugar. I really enjoyed the balanced of the tea, fruit, and sweetness. The initial taste, as the drink passes over your tongue, is berry followed by a hint of pomegranate acidity, then what remains is the tea flavor. I vigorously shook the huge, vial-like glass, but nevertheless, the first few sips left a strong, bitter aftertaste. Fortunately, the last few sips didn't include the aftertaste, so I finished off happy.Overall, it is a decent diet drink, with a good all-around balance of flavors. Plus, it's all-natural and has those wonderful anti-oxidants that everyone seems to want and POM seems to market so well.

Bagel Boss Catering
CONTENT
Sabrina, our niece, had her Jewish Baby Naming Party today and the spread was amazing. Kasi (Lon's sister) hired Bagel Boss Bagel Boss to do the catering. She ordered the gold package plus an omelet station and the 50+ guests were constantly raving about the food.Let's start with the fish: lox, smoked whitefish, pickled herring, smoked sable. They were all fresh and perfectly flavored. My mom kept telling me how much she loved them as she ate plate after plate. I have to agree. They were all fantastic.The Sun Dried Tomato Pasta Salad was nicely balanced.The California Salad was one of my favorites. I already love the combination of fruits, nuts, and cheese, but this feta was so creamy and it was just so attractive. I forgot to put dressing on, while I was piling stuff on my plate, and I didn't miss it at all.The only thing I remember not liking too much was the blueberry pancakes but I did like the Challah French Toast (no photo).There was a variety of bagels and mini bagels (good idea), tons of flavored cream cheeses, egg salad, and tuna salad. Lon said they were good. I decided not to have one in effort to save stomach space. The Challah was gorgeous but average in taste and texture.I was full already when Lon convinced me to have an omelet by repeating himself as he ate his, \"This is so good....this is so good....this is so good.\" My mom came over and raved about hers too. Ok, time to try it.There was a great selection of fillings but I took this opportunity to eat mushrooms since Lon doesn't eat them. I chose onions, mushrooms, swiss and American cheese, with half eggs, and half egg whites. It was fantastic.I finished off with fruit and pastries. The chocolate covered strawberries were large and juicy.The blueberry cheese danishes and rugelach were pretty good. The black & white cookies were standard. There was just too much to taste.They also made a special giant black & white cookie for Sabrina.There was so much extra food that everyone packed doggy bags, and we still had large amounts left-over. The cost included linens and a staff of two, coffee, tea, sodas, and juices. (My only complaint is that they ran out of water.) The disposable utensils and plates were the really sturdy expensive kind. I actually haven't ever seen disposable ones that nice before. I was so impressed with the wonderful service too. The two women helped us clean the party room and pack food, going beyond what I felt was their responsibility.Bagel Boss is in Long Island and I believe Kasi and Stephen got much more value for the dollar by ordering from them over a Manhattan caterer. They only charged $50 as a car lot fee because they had to leave one car for the two women to get home. I think that is incredibly reasonable and generous since there was no travel time fee or extra gas fee for one car and one van to come to Manhattan. I have made mental note to recommend them whenever possible.

Here's their website if anyone wants it http://www.bagelbossroslyn.com/When Jessica mentions leftovers that barely covers it, we got the unopened soda bottles, the leftover omelette fixings which was a ton.  And, the chef was very neat in using them, so the ingredients didn't mix. And the spinach was a beautiful, fine 1/4″ dice not the big leafy pieces you sometimes get in an omelette.We were very happy with the food & service.

Wedding Menu Tasting #2
CONTENT
Since we weren't that happy with our first tasting, our venue asked us to come back for a second one, where the executive chef, Phil, would be present. This experience was much better and I'm a bit more relaxed now.We started with the Crab Cakes which were still not lump crab meat but tasted much much better. They were the right consistency, fork tender, but not mushy. Presentation was again, very nice.The Kung Pao Calamari was very distinctive. Each crispy fried piece was cooked perfectly and tossed in a Kung Pao Sauce with assorted nuts. I loved the different textures and really enjoyed the unique taste. It was a bit too sweet for me but perfect for Lon, who was ready to lick the plate clean.Next, we were most impressed with the Sesame Crusted Striped Bass. The pretty sesame coating added a nice crunch to the tender fish. It was laid across a great Parmesan Risotto, but to be nit picky, it really wasn't risotto, more of a rice version of mac & cheese. Still, it was delicious, creamy and cheesy, with fresh scallions. We made note to ask for less sauce too, but it was really a fantastic dish.The Duck Legs were way better than last time. The skin was still not crispy, but the duck had the aroma and flavor of duck. The sweet potato mash was just as good as last time, and they added skinny crispy French fries on top, exactly the way I like them.The one dish that was worse than last time was the Filet Mignon. It was cooked medium-rare, as ordered; it was just the meat itself that we did not like. We both thought there was some off-taste to it. Each of the main courses were served with a neat little bundle of string beans and carrot that were perfectly al dente.As we finished up, Chef Phil sat with us to discuss our meal and what I came away with is: Some things will not be perfect because there's always going to be a glitch here or there, especially when you're as picky as I am. But, I can tell that Chef Phil and Gary (the manager) are listening to our critiques and working hard to make things as wonderful as they can for us. Even our waiter, John, was fantastic, just like our waiter last time. Carlyle on the Green is truly a service place.As full as we were, they insisted on bringing us a grand dessert platter, like last time. I couldn't eat much more but I managed to free up some space for that insanely good ice cream sandwich.This killed my hope of going light so I hope it's worth it.

On the site and more so offline, I often talk about how important service is to me.  I can cook as well as most restaurant chefs, so rarely am I going out to eat purely for the cuisine, although I do enjoy being inspired.So I want to highlight the importance of the wondrous and rarely seen service that Gary, the General Manager at Carlyle on the Green, has ensured and provided.First, he is consistently gracious, even during our regular quality checks.  Second, he has done a stellar job in staffing, John, the manager of the restaurant, Andrew, the waiter who served us last time, Phil the Executive Chef, and even the busboy who tended to us (I didn't catch his name), were so helpful and easygoing.  They all knew their job and treated us like royalty.Whether you're about to pay tens of thousand of dollars to a business or just ten dollars, you should always receive this level of service.  So even with the minor food glitches, my hat is off to the team at Carlyle.And finally, third, when we bring up issues, it is purely for the purpose of identifying and resolving those issues.  There is zero mal-intent.  And it makes me so happy to work with Phil & Gary who both pick up on that and work to resolve the issues immediately.What a wonderful experience.  If the wedding is like this, we are going to be very happy!

I should know better than to read your blog when I am hungry... or even when I am not hungry.  Sometimes I think I can actually taste the food just from the descriptions you provide.  I am very excited to go to your wedding.  I already know what I am going to order.  And Lon, I agree with you about service.  I think service is a key differentiator in business, especially among New Yorkers.

Two Boots To Go West
CONTENT
Lon likes Two Boots pizza and I couldn't remember if I did or not, having one slice over 5 years ago. We decided to order a pie, half plain, half Bayou Beast, from Two Boots To Go West Two Boots To Go West. It took over 45 minutes to get our delivery, but they did say it would take about 40 minutes. The problem is that it came room temperature, as if it had not been heated at all. Starving, I stood staring at my toaster, heating my slice.I usually prefer pizza plain, especially when I'm testing out a place. Two Boots pizza is pretty distinct, so it'll be up to personal taste. They use cornmeal in their crust, an herb heavy sauce, and it's a thin pizza, less filling than most. It's not really my thing and there's something missing in the cheese for me too, possibly not creamy enough? Lon likes their pizza, especially because they have somewhat interesting toppings. The Bayou Beast has BBQ shrimp, crawfish, jalapeno, and andouille sausage. I tried some and the shrimp and crawfish were terribly over-cooked, until dry and flavorless, but the jalapeno and andouille gave a nice unique flavor to the pizza.Lon does prefer the Cajun Pizza at Mardi Gras Pizza Mardi Gras Pizza but like most of the pizza places I like in the city, we're not in their delivery zone. Time to move.

Last night, Scott and I went to Una Pizza Napoletana since we've both been wanting to try it for awhile. Its the little pizza place on E. 12th St. Much to our disappointment, we both hated the experience.1.) The pizza is way way way overpriced. Its $21 for a individual 12 inch pie. We had 2 pies and 1 soda and with tip it was almost $60. It would have been fine if the pizza was spectacular, but it was medicore in my opinion. Neither of us were full either. Most of the tables around us had to order an extra pie.2.) The pizza was decent, but in no way warranted the $21 price tag. There are 4 types to choose from: marinara (no cheese), margherita (buffalo mozzerela), white (no sauce), and a filetti(fresh cherry tomatos, no sauce). There are no toppings and no condiments. (There also isn't ice because the table next to us asked for a glass of ice for their soda and the waiter said they didn't have ice.) The filetti was good, but we both found the margherita to be pretty tasteless and since there aren't condiments you can't even jazz it up on your own. The crust is almost like a cripsy pita which had a nice chewy bite to it but it had a bit of a sour taste  which I wasn't fond of.3.) Service was horrible. It took forever to get anyone's attention during the whole meal to get a seat, to order, to pay, etc. We waited almost 5 minutes after our pizza arrived at our table to try and get the waiter to bring us utenzils.On a good note, since we were still hungry we walked over to Artichoke on 14th St, the new take out pizza place, which Scott and I both found very enjoyable. Its funny, but the table sitting next to us at Una Pizza Napoletana were also there making up for the lack luster meal they just experienced at Una Pizza Napoletana. Anyway, we had a slice of the signature spinach artichoke and a slice of the plain. Both were delicious and only $3 for a gigantic slice. I did find the crust a bit thicker than I normally like on the spinach artichoke slice, and there was a bit too much cheese for my taste, but it had a nice flavor and being an artichoke lover, I would get it again.  The plain slice was great. Just the right crust thickness where its thin enough you get that nice cripy crust on the bottem, but thick enough to have a nice chewyness. The sauce on the pizza was flavorful and I think they sprinkle some fresh grated parmesan on it so it had a really nice cheese flavor. Scott loved it which says a lot since he's very particular about his pizza as some of you know. If you can, I would order a whole pie which is only $15for plain and $20 for the spinach artichoke (I'm sure those prices will be going up soon). Make sure you call ahead though. The place was packed and there was a line out the door (they were also short staffed though).

Btw, as an idicator of how good Artichoke was, it passed my burn the roof of my mouth test. Basically, I get too excited when I see a hot slice of pizza and normally take a bite before I've given the cheese a chance to cool, thus, I usually burn the roof of my mouth. So, the test is if pizza is really good, I normally don't notice the pain and continue to eat and enjoy and realize the effects of my impatience after I'm done. This is what happened to me at Artichoke. I was so engrossed in the pizza and enjoying it with such happiness I didn't realize I burnt the roof of my mouth until later. I'm suffering a bit today for it, but I think it was worth it. From now on though, Scott will be taking bites of pizza first to make sure that the pizza is cool enough for me to eat.

No ice and no conditments - what kind of crap is that. I was all fired up.Una Pizza Napoletana - 349 East 12th Street. This place sucks, so don't eat there.

I love stumbling across cute new places like Papabubble Papabubble, an artistic candy shop, where you can watch the candy makers kneed and pull beautifully colored sugar. It's amazing how they get these little designs into small pieces of candy. I've seen the process on TV before on \"How It's Made\" but here you can watch it in person.Papabubble already has successful shops in Barcelona, Tokyo, and Amsterdam. We wish them well here. Too bad I can't try the candy (I'm allergic to food coloring), but they do have free samples for you to try before you buy anything.

Aspen Restaurant
CONTENT
Yesterday my team at Linkstorm and I had lunch at Aspen Restaurant and Lounge Aspen Restaurant. Everyday I walk past the place and notice how incredibly empty it is, both day and night. Josh had mentioned to me that he was hoping to go and Angie had mentioned that the food was pretty good, albeit slightly overpriced. So when they started offering a $20, three-course prix fixe lunch, I knew it was time to throw the empty joint a bone.The lunch menu offers a nice selection across the American fare menu and includes an appetizer, a lunch entree, and a dessert. As we sat at the semi-tight booth, we noticed that the lodge-inspired decoration was definitely distinctive, although Aspen's affinity for antlers was a bit weird. Anyway, between the four of us, we tried a good portion of the lunch menu.Tim and Gabe both started with the soup du jour: New England Clam Chowder. They both felt the soup was too thin; Tim felt the flavor was a bit too herbal and Gabe felt the potatoes were undercooked. I didn't taste it, but it smelled good. Melinda had the Warm Goat Cheese & Arugala Salad. I started with the Crispy Crabcake over Tri-Color Bell Pepper and Jicama Salad. The crab cakes were more like croquettes, in an oblong shape. They were a bit cold and offered little crab flavor. The salad was quite good though, the julienne of peppers and jicama was executed flawlessly. While no one's appetizer's surpassed \"average\" they were presented well.For mains, Gabe had the Wild Boar Sausage with Homemade Applekraut. He seemed to enjoy it and we were all pleasantly surprised to see craisins in a restaurant dish. Go figure. Melinda and Tim both binged on Bison Sliders with Cheddar, Bacon, and \"Gonzo\" sauce. They were served perfectly medium-rare on perfect fitting brioche. They both really liked the mini-burgers. I liked the way the burgers were served with a full gerken on top.I selected the Pan-Fried Brook Trout Tacos with Spicy Slaw & Salsa Fresca. The two small (six inches), soft taco shells filled with the slaw and fried fish. The portion was a bit small, one more taco would've been perfect, but it was very tasty. I would absolutely have it again, although not at the normal menu price of $12.Gabe and Tim ordered the Pumpkin Flan, which arrived before the other desserts. The dish was much more of a thick pumpkin custard with burnt sugar syrup than a flan. It was fairly good and extremely pumpkiny (i.e. it almost turned into a carriage!). At the last minute, Melinda selected the Mango sorbet. It was okay, but nothing special.I felt I was the winner at dessert time with the mini, frosted cupcakes. They had a clever name like \"cloud frosting,\" but I can't recall it exactly. The cupcakes were a bit over cooked, crispy outsides and almost non-existent inside. But the rich, cream cheese frosting completely drew my attention away from the lifeless cake. It was perfect, not overly sweet, and very rich. Plus the cupcakes (and the plate) was covered in confetti-style, multi-colored sugar -- yum! I licked the plate clean.Overall, the food was slightly above average, and the decor is definitely distinctive. At $20 per person, for three courses, it's a good deal, and perfect for a lunch meeting in the Flat Iron District.

Dim Sum in Chinatown has been deteriorating for years, especially compared to Flushing, which is improving. I'm always willing to try though, and since Lily was visiting New York, we (Lily, Alice, and me) went for dim sum at HSF HSF. Every dish was below the Flushing standard, made worse by the restaurant being empty, leading to most dishes being lukewarm or cold. It's not even worth getting into the details but shrimp was over-cooked, everything looked small and skimpy, many dumplings were stuck to each other or the paper beneath it. We had shrimp shu mai, regular shu mai, crystal dumplings, vegetable dumplings, turnip cake, and shrimp wrapped in rice noodles. The three of us left still hungry, not willing to try more.If you want dim sum, go to Flushing.

Jess - have you ever tried dim sum in Jersey?  Flushing is too far for my parents to drive so we tend to eat at dim sum restaurants in Edison, NJ a lot.  Their dishes taste better than Chinatown and are also a little more innovative.  I actually haven't tried dim sum in Flushing yet.  I def. want to go with you next time.

Sorry that didn't turn out so great!!My favorite, go to, comfort spot for traditional dim sum in Queens is Pings on Queens Blvd. (next to the Italian Charities of America). When I don't feel like dealing with the crowds in Flushing, we go here and always leave full...Afterwards, you can grab dessert at Sunrise Bakery down the block...good luck!

Mama's Mudsliders
CONTENT
After walking around for what seemed like an hour, looking for dessert to end the night, Angie, Scott, Lon, and I, walked into Mama's Mudsliders. Mama's Mudsliders The menu looked like simple stuff, where you can't go wrong. Boy, were we wrong. I don't know if they were having a really off night but everything was near disastrous.Angie ordered three flavors of ice cream. The best way I can describe the coffee was that it was dry. How you make ice cream taste dry, I don't know. The peanut butter wasn't as bad but still no one ate it after the first taste. The vanilla was the only one eaten. Lon ordered the Frozen Banana Custard with caramel walnut sauce. It had that fake banana flavor with a bitter aftertaste. Angie and Lon argued over the whether the sauce or custard was worse. By the end, the large portion was barely touched. I ordered Apple Filled Beignets, which were fried in an off-tasting oil. I never thought I would say this about a dessert, but it wasn't sweet enough for me. There was five pieces. Each person tried one and no one would eat the last one.At this point, the waitress came over and asked if everything was ok, and we all kind of shrugged. No one wanted to tell our really nice waitress what we really thought. Lon asked her if this was a health food dessert place, and she said no. We couldn't figure out what it was but everything just tasted odd. Scott's Birch Beer Float came at the end, and it was the only normal tasting dessert.This is the worst dining experience Lon or I have had in a very long time and it was moderately expensive. Lesson to learn: Never walk into an empty place.

Actually, Jess is too nice on this place.  First, when we walked in, it was too hot.  On a brisk Spring night, how does an ICE CREAM shop get too warm? Especially with only two other couples in there plus four employees?  Second, the food was DISGUSTING.  You should only send your friends here as a practical joke.Speaking of jokes, as Jessica started to mention, I asked the waitress if the food was supposed to be healthy, she said no.  I wasn't convinced.  I asked if the ice cream was low fat, she said "no."  I asked "low sugar?" She said "no."  We joked at the table that perhaps we were on candid camera.Well we knew we weren't since candid camera is off the air; Mama's Mudsliders should follow suit and shut down.

I have to agree with Lon. Jess is being nice. The desserts were absolutely dreadful to say the least. If it weren't for the nice waitress, I think I would have walked out. I love dessert and will pretty much put up with anything and I could barely touch anything at this place. The only reason the root beer floated tasted decent is because they didn't make the root beer. I haven't tasted anything so repulsive in awhile. I really wanted to like the place, but even the water tasted funny. I have no  how they are still in business, but avoid it at all costs.

Well, I've been there recently and I'm a hard one to win over, but maybe since your time of being there, the food has improved dramatically. There are plenty of fun retro things on the menu that allow you to explore without having a total sugar overload, but leaving happily satisfied and sated beyond measure. I assure you that you would not have a similar experience as you did before.

This is surprising. I've had many good experiences here including the frozen banana custard with caramel walnut sauce. It was really tasty and I've had a lot of dessert in my lifetime. Not sure what to say except it does deserve a second chance - the owner, who I met, just the one time, used to be the pastry chef at Kittichai, and it's not exactly easy to strike out and do your own thing. She was trying hard with her desserts - and it's easy to sling mud - no pun intended - but not so easy to get every dish right every night. Even if you wouldn't consider it again, I'd encourage readers seeing this to try it for themselves.

The Place
CONTENT
The Place The Place is a cute and cozy space that fits right into the West Village, with a few open air seats in the front. They achieve a good balance between dim romantic lighting and being able to read your menu and see your food. While some of the food was very good, a few strange disappointments left me a bit confused about this chef.Lon and I were dining with Scott and Angie, food sharers, people who are great to eat with because you can try everything on each other's plates. Angie's appetizer was the Diver Sea Scallops over Roasted Brussels Sprouts and Baby Tomato Confit. The scallops were perfectly cooked but just a little bit fishy.I had the Char-grilled Calamari and Tiger Shrimp over Steamed Vegetable Wontons. The Calamari were perfect. The shrimp was slightly over-cooked. The vegetable wontons, not at all like the Chinese kind, were surprisingly pretty good.Lon had the best appetizer, Duck Leg Confit over a White Bean Ragout. The tender meat was easily pulled off the bone, and scooped up with beans for each bite. The flavors worked so well together. (Sorry for that dark photo.)Lon wasn't so lucky with his entree, the worst dish of the evening, Cajun Spiced Fish Stew. The clams and mussels were ok, but the lobster and shrimp were rubbery. The flavor of the broth was just mediocre.Scott had the Herb Roasted Pork Tenderloin, which was tender, with a subtle hint of anise. It sat on top of well flavored Tomato and Asparagus Orzo.Angie chose Three Way Long Island Duck. I tasted the duck breast (perfectly cooked), the duck wonton (pretty good, I think fresh dough), and what they called a Vegetable and Scallion Moo Shoo. Under that nice looking pile of shredded veggies, is a dry, sweet, and dense, cake-like disc. All of us tried it and no one understood this side. Lon jokingly said it's a thick pancake and just needs some maple syrup.I couldn't decide what to order so the waiter recommended the Hanger Steak. He said the Jack Daniels Peppercorn Sauce was good and he was right. To be picky, the steak was a bit under-cooked (I ordered medium-rare) but I prefer that to over-cooked so I didn't send it back. Everyone liked the Hanger Steak anyway. The outside was charred nicely and the meat itself was very flavorful. I enjoyed every bite.It was served with a side of Bubble and Squeak Potatoes. Cute name, but I didn't get it. It looked like mashed potatoes and tasted like mashed potatoes with with a weird texture inside. At first, I thought there was some paper in my mashed potatoes, but I pulled some out and showed it to everyone in my table. We decided it wasn't paper and it was intentional so I flagged down my waiter to ask him what it was.Me: Excuse me, what is this stuff in the mashed potatoes? (holding a piece up for him to see) Waiter: It's not paper. (everyone laughs) Me: Ok, what is it? Waiter: It's potato skins and green cabbage. Me: Oh ok, thank you. (Waiter walks away) Lon: When enough people have asked about paper in their mashed potatoes (Notice, that we did not ask him if it was paper), it's time to make a change.I'm torn about this place because some dishes were very enjoyable and some were not. The portions, plate presentation, and ingredient quality, seem right for the price. It could potentially be a great date place. Unfortunately, some of the offenses were too noticeable, and the four of us didn't think we would go back. There's just too many places to try in New York, so you have to really impress to get repeat customers.

Bubble and squeak is actually a traditional English dish, mashed potatoes with veg like cabbage mixed in, kind of a "leftovers" type thing. The name has to do with the sound it makes as its cooking, I think. I've had it before as a patty of mashed potato and veg that had been pan-fried...mabes this was just a bad version?

I was taking advantage of this gorgeous day, aimlessly strolling with Ice (my Jack Russell Terrier), and by the time we were close to home again, I was exhausted. She still wanted to be outside so I looked for a place to grab coffee. I could sit and relax in the park, while she could continue to people watch (Manhattan dog!). I remembered that Tarallucci e Vino (been there for lunch) has a To Go window, so convenient for dog owners!When I got there, I was tempted, seeing that they had gelato, but lost interest as I saw the girl really struggle with scooping it. It seemed to be too cold and I believe gelato should be held at 12-15 degrees F above American ice cream. So I stuck with coffee and of course a smile came across my face when the counter girl steamed the half and half. We walked to the park and I sipped my coffee. There was nothing offensive about the flavor but it was too weak for me. Beyond the creamy, frothy stuff, I couldn't really taste much else. If someone at Tarallucci is reading this, I think you just need to brew it a bit stronger.In any case, it didn't dampen my mood. The weather was perfect and Ice was happy, as people crowded around to pet her.

More Trader Joe's
CONTENT
Continuing on our review of Trader Joe's products, I picked up two new (new to me) ones last night. The Country Choice Organic Multigrain hot cereal is a nice alternative to oatmeal. I was getting bored of eating the same thing every day, but I did want to stay on the healthy thing. The mix of rye, barley, oats, and wheat gives a slightly different mix of flavors and textures but if you don't like oatmeal, you probably won't like this. It's very similar.The Tandoori Naan is not authentic but it's good. Eaten as is, it's doughy and slightly under-baked, the way Lon likes it. I prefer it lightly toasted so that the outside crisps a little bit. The inside stays super soft.

Just found your blog and I love it.  I also think the TJ MultiGrain is much more interesting than plain oatmeal.  I usually add raisens and a cut up apple or some blueberries to my serving.mpp

Another Sushi Yasuda (Not So) Quickie - 5th Visit
CONTENT
I started writing quickies on Sushi Yasuda because I've already posted about them so many times. Again, the quickies only feature the new fish I have not tried before. This amuse bouche of clam, seaweed, and scallions, with a light wasabi dressing, was such an interesting play of textures, tender with a snap.Pictured on the right, is halibut, a fish I have always thought of as boring because I've always had it cooked. Halibut sashimi's subtle flavor shines through here. Angie (my dinner companion last night) and I, both loved it.The Striped Bass is a more tendonous fish. I am more interesting in the soft, buttery ones. Look at how beautifully scored it is though.Razor clam, which I have never had raw (several sushi restaurants serve razor clam cooked), was very enjoyable, as all the different types of clams are to me. Like Cherrystone Clam and Orange Clam, they all have that wonderful slippery, clean feel, and a gentle snap when you bite in.Cooked shrimp, always boring to me at a sushi restaurant, did not stand out here either, except for the shrimp being larger than what most places offer.My last piece was Squid Legs, a beautiful presentation, with a dab of the sweet sauce commonly used on eel, chewy, crunchy, sweet and salty.Ok, so that was not as short as a quickie should be, but I guess I tried lots of new fish. Till next week, for the next installment of Sushi Yasuda Quickie.

I'm not the quickest person in the world, but if I had to guess, I'd say you like this place ;-). Each time you post on SY, I get more and more excited about our upcoming visit. We've got a reservation for 3 at the bar next Wed (I requested Yasuda himself), and we're not going to order -- just have him prepare whatever he'd like to serve us until we're full (except uni..I'll request lots and lots of uni). We can't wait!

2008-04-10 11:15:00
Sheng, you're going to have a great time! I never really appreciated uni fully until I had it at SY.I read your fantastic review of Per Se and I am now tempted to go. I've never spent near that much money on a meal but it may have to be my wedding present to myself.

I just wanted to make a general comment about your blog and say thank you for inspiring me to try new foods that i've always been to scared to try! also, as a college student i've always been addicted to starbucks but now i'm determined to find a real coffee house with real, good coffee.  anyway, i read your blog every day (even though i live in charleston, sc) and it's a lot of fun and makes me want to go out and enjoy real food instead of processed, freeze dried, fried concoctions that americans love so much.  well, before i ramble on anymore i just wanted to thank you again!

Angie
2008-04-10 14:53:00
Sheng, its Angie(in case my name doesn't come up), I highly suggest you get the combo that Jess normally gets and then add on pieces from there. I did it the way you are planning on doing it and actually got many of the same pieces you would with the combo which is less expensive and comes with a salad.
Jessica@Foodmayhem
2008-04-10 15:00:00
Sigh...wedding at Per Se....I wonder where I would have my wedding if I had ten times more money.....I hope Sushi Yasuda doesn't hate me for giving away the secret to eating there affordably. =/

The wedding was beautiful but they they can only seat 75 people.  So not optimal for you.
Sheng
2008-04-10 15:56:00
Thanks for the tip Angie. What's the name of the combo and how many pieces? Is it all nigiri? Besides the uni, eel, halibut, and squid-legs, any must-not-miss pieces you recommend I get?Jess, I wouldn't worry. The folks at Sushi Yasuda would only thank you for the positive reviews and extra business you give them. You're a regular now!And a quick word on Per Se -- best dining experience ever. Execution of food was flawless, but some people think the food is soulless (I totally disagree). For someone who appreciates food and cooking as much as you do, I think you'd have a great meal there. Just don't be an idiot like me and eat pizza at 2pm when Per Se reservations were at 5:45!P.S. Sara might've told you already, but you should look into posting your beautiful food pics on tastespotting.com. A lot of foodies subscribe to that blog, and it's a quick and easy way to get more traffic your way. I use it all the time when I'm lacking inspiration for new dishes to make or places to try.
Angie
2008-04-10 15:58:00
hahahaha. Oops. The secret is out I guess. But... they did get a lot more SY regulars (including myself) because it can be affordable. So, I think they should thank you at the end of the day.

2008-04-10 16:13:00
Sheng - so for the sushi/sashimi combo, you get 3 selection of sashimi (chef's choice - i had spanish mackeral, tuna and one other fish both times) and you get to pick 4 pieces of sushi from a list of about 20 fishes (uni unfortunately is not one of them) as well as one roll. Halibut and Eel are definitely on the list.
Angie
2008-04-10 16:15:00
Sorry Sheng. I just saw your second post. Its just the sushi and sashimi combo. You get 3 kinds of sashimi, 4 sushi pieces, and 1 roll all of your choice plus a small salad all for $20.50 I believe. Just make sure you tell the waitress so she'll give you the little sheet to fill out.I loved the eel we had yesterday. I think it was the sea eel (Jess if you can please confirm). It was so good I had two pieces. Its a little sweet a little salty with a nice meaty texture. Its not the one with the sauce but the one with the sprinkle of sea salt if that helps. It was really really delicious. Jess told me Lon loves it as well.One thing I kind of overlooked until the end of the meal the first time I went was the rolls. So make sure you save some room for those.I would just say sit back and enjoy. Everything is good. You really can't go wrong there.
Jessica@Foodmayhem
2008-04-10 17:27:00
Sorry, typo, before....Sea Eel is the one Angie is talking about and it is one of Lon's favorites. For me, every time I go, I have to have orange clam. Cherrystone clam is similar but I had them both back to back yesterday to compare and I think I like orange clam slightly more. (Both of those are available in your choice of 4 pieces of sushi.) I also have to have oyster every time I go. They are just the juiciest oysters you'll ever have. For your roll choice, I've grown very fond of Tazmanian Trout. But like Angie said, you can't really go wrong and if the chef makes a suggestion, take it, cause they often have different special items that are not always available. They will tell you. Oh, and Lon and I really enjoyed the fried soft shell crab, if you want some non-sushi/sashimi item.
Casie
2008-04-10 17:38:00

Allow me to expand on the observations of my wife (much younger than me, should that interest you)....First, let me qualify my question and my subsequent comments by the admission that I am NOT in favor of “globalism.” I think that the concept is VERY dangerous to the health and welfare to the citizens of the United States of America.That being said, I am infuriated by the daily reports of China’s shipping of poisonous food and food-related products into the U.S. China has inundated us with poisonous products including pet foods, fruits and juices, vegetables, meat products, seafood, toothpaste, and God knows what else.Many of our elected officials, who could not care less about our health, permit this travesty in the name of “open-trade” and “globalism.”• So, what can we do to protect ourselves from China’s poisonous products? • What are YOU doing to protect yourself?• What suggestions do you have for the rest of us?I know that “FoodMayhem” is not a political forum, nor should it be. However, the problem of people being sickened (and in some cases, dying) from eating imported crap . . . insufficiently regulated by our government . . . is worthy of rational discussion.
Sheng
2008-04-22 23:52:00
Doc,It's good of you to appreciate that this is not a political forum -- yet somehow you still feel compelled to use a food blog as your soapbox to expound upon your political views; I can only presume that this is an attempt at cleaning up after your wife's blatantly offensive comments. And by the way, the fact that she is younger than you is no excuse for her inappropriate, not to mention irrelevant, ad hominem remarks. To be honest, it is still beyond me what safety of Chinese exports has anything to do with a post on one's meal at a sushi restaurant.There is no need to belabor the points brought up, as it is a blog whose mission is to share cooking and dining experiences among friends and food enthusiasts. I will only mention one thing with regard to your notions of "globalism". Regardless of whether or not you are a proponent, I hope that you and your wife will eventually realize that globalism is not a recent trend but has been an essential component of the American identity ever since the Founding Fathers and their ancestors set foot on this continent. It is truly a melting pot, where Chinese food and sushi is consumed even more frequently than apple pie. And contrary to what you might think, I believe that diversity is a good thing for this country. I'll leave it at that. Unless there are statements to be made that are directly pertinent to the post, I propose that further discussion of this topic move to another forum.

Macchiato Espresso Bar Macchiato Espresso Bar could easily be a bar/lounge scene if the lights were turned down. It made me feel like I was meeting for after-work \"drinks\" without having to drink alcohol. I ordered a half regular, half decaf coffee (they serve organic), and it was good. Hallelujah! Dark, yet smooth, I even drank a few sips black. As I was paying, the guy behind the counter pointed out the cookies that were sitting on a warmer. Ok, can't resist a warm cookie with my coffee, throw it in....The cookie was similar to a chocolate chip cookie except that the cookie dough seemed folded around a layer of chocolate pieces.When you break open the cookie, you can see the melted gooey goodness. The soft and chewy cookie is an improvement on the classic chocolate chip cookie, as if it were designed for me.I'm sold. The prices are perfectly reasonable for a nice place to meet up in midtown, with very good coffee, and a memorable cookie.

Mars Generation Max
CONTENT
The Alliance for a Healthier Generation has come up with guidelines for foods sold in schools. In response, Mars has produced a line of Generation Max bars and snacks to put in vending machines, where their regular candy bars will no longer be sold. We tried the Generation Max 3 Musketeers Chocolate Brownie Bar and it was a bit hard to chew. I tried tasting the top and bottom separately and the top is a sticky white substance that tastes mainly like sugar. The bottom has a dull chocolate flavor, possibly some rice krispy-like pieces, and is extremely dense. It is quite amazing that a bar this size (1.26 oz) is only 140 calories but neither of us would ever eat it again.

Starbucks Free Pike Place Roast
CONTENT
If you haven't noticed the crowds by your local Starbucks, they were giving out free coffee today (starting at different times at different locations), their new Pike Place Roast. I asked Lon to pick me up a cup on his way home from work if the wait wasn't too long, and by around 6:30 PM, there was no one on line. The Pike Place Roast tastes less burnt than their regular coffee but it's still very acidic. It's still not something I would buy. That's just my two cents. Here's what a lot of others think....They seem to be using their old logo again, but the words are different, reading Starbucks, Fresh Roasted Coffee. I'm kind of turned off by the fat mermaid but more importantly, I'm still turned off by their coffee.

I've always thought it was funny how they tried to turn the accidental burning of their first roast to their 'trademark' flavor.Every year or so I go in and see if they have improved it at all.  I went in today to check out the new roast, and well, like you, I'm still waiting...

Three Herb Pork Tenderloin on Ciabatta
CONTENT
I through together this pork tenderloin, thinking that I would heat up some left over rice to serve with it, but then Lon called and he was going to be late coming home from work. The pork was already in the oven and almost ready to come out. It would no longer be hot when he arrived. Quickly, I switched dinner plans, the room temperature pork would now be made into a sandwich. When Lon got home, I sliced the pork into 1/2 inch slices, and laid it on ciabatta with a spread (half mayo/half whole grain mustard).The key is not to over-cook the pork tenderloin. There is an old misconception that pork needs to be cooked to well-done, but we now know that pork only needs to be cooked to an internal temperature of 137 degrees to kill Trichinella Spiralis. The USDA currently advises that pork be cooked to 160 degrees (medium) but when I make tenderloin (an extremely low-fat cut of meat), I prefer medium-rare (145 degrees). This gives the sliced pork tenderloin a roast beef like quality, moist and juicy.Three Herb Pork Tenderloin1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees.2. Mix together olive oil, granulated garlic, paprika, parsley, rosemary, and thyme. Set aside.3. Break each celery stalk in half. Place the four pieces on the bottom of a shallow pan.4. Rub the herb mixture over the pork tenderloin evenly and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Rest the tenderloin on top of the celery and bake for 25 minutes or until medium rare.5. Let is sit for at least 10 minutes before slicing. Tastes great at any temperature, even left-overs straight out of the fridge, so try not to reheat it.

I love Sa Cha Sauce!
CONTENT
Sa Cha Sauce, also known as Chinese Barbecue Sauce, is one of my favorite flavors from Asia. It's a staple sauce for hot pot, but for me, it's my go to sauce for stir fry's. It's different every time I make it because you can just throw whatever you have in, vegetables, proteins, noodles, add Sa Cha Sauce and some soy sauce. Here are a couple of ways I've cleaned out my fridge with this dish.Sample 1 - I had linguine left over from the night before and had bell peppers, jalapenos, tomato, carrots, broccoli rabe and onions, making a Sa Cha Lo Mein.Sample 2 - I had a left-over drumstick so I pulled off all the meat and threw it in the wok with jalapenos, bell peppers, broccoli, carrots, grape tomatoes, and scallions. I served it with my left-over multi-grain Korean rice.Sample 3 - We had a quick lunch with Wei-Chuan mini buns and some left-over food, and I wanted a vegetable side dish. I used Chinese broccoli, scallions, onions, carrots, grape tomatoes, and celery.Sample 4 - I made a quick lunch with celery, grape tomatoes, onions, eggplant, asparagus, red bell peppers, and mung bean noodles. I placed an over-easy egg on top, and there's a healthy meal.I've read many recipes described as \"everything but the kitchen sink...\" and I guess this falls in that category. Let me know of you try it and what you threw in.

It's such a crazy coincidence but I just looked at your site because I saw your post about Sushi Yasuda on Tastespotting. After reading that post I immediately saw and clicked the title "I love Sa Cha Sauce" on your recent posts list! And that was before you posted on my site.  I love Sa Cha BBQ sauce too!  Especially in my hotpot sauce.  How else do you like to use it?

Sa Cha is definitely a must for hot pot! I use it in stir-fry's mostly, occasionally soups.

H & H Midtown Bagels East
CONTENT
On our way to Long Island, Kasi picked up some bagels for Lon and I to eat in the car. They were from H & H Midtown Bagels East H & H Midtown Bagels East, not to be confused with H & H Bagels.I enjoyed my everything bagel because it was plump and doughy, but it was missing that slightly crisp outside. The smoked salmon was average but they did put a very generous portion on it. Lon and I agreed that we would eat bagels from them again, but we wouldn't travel to get it.

Martha's Country Bakery
CONTENT
I was so excited that a bakery had opened up by my parent's house, so we had to give it a taste. This was obviously not part of my \"going light\" plan, but Martha's Country Bakery Martha's Country Bakery was so inviting. The space is well-lit in a warm way, with a long counter in front, and a seating area in the back. Every single dessert was beautiful and I really wanted everything.We talked to a few people behind the counter, which gave an average service experience, and narrowed down our choices. Surprisingly, they do not sell breads, but plan to in the near future, so we chose one pastry and five cupcakes and headed home.We ate this nicely shaped pastry (don't know the name) on the train and while it was fresh and flaky, and lightly sweetened, it was missing something. It wasn't at all buttery.We used all of our restraint to save the cupcakes for after dinner, and after I taunted Lon like a 5-year-old for an hour (Can we have it now?...How about now?.....), we sat down to our feast. Now the cupcakes would be at optimal room temperature.The Chocolate Cupcake with Peanut Butter Frosting was a dry cake with little flavor, topped with a very good peanut butter frosting.The Oreo Cupcake was a similar case. The same dry cake with little flavor, but a good frosting, although too sweet for me.The Red Velvet Cupcake was also a dry and flavorless cake, but the cream cheese frosting was tangy, creamy, and just heavenly. That same delicious frosting was on the Carrot Cupcake, which had the only moist cake, but it had too many raisins and the chunks of nuts were too large. The Black Forest Cake was the worst, dry flavorless cake, with a sugary frosting.I was so disappointed because I really wanted to like Martha's Country Bakery but it seems that the good frostings ( a bit too sweet for my taste though) can't outweigh terrible cake. Sadly, that means, I won't be back, no matter how good it all looks.

Jade Asian Restaurant on the Weekend
CONTENT
The first time I tried Jade Asian Restaurant Jade Asian Restaurant, it was a Monday, and it was just me and my mom. We said we would be back to try them on a weekend, and this time, we had my brother, Lon, Lon's mom, and Lon's Grandma with us so we could try more dishes. We tried so many plates that this post makes a good reference for dishes, although we did try to skip most of the deep fried items.The one dish I must have, every time I have dim sum, is the Shrimp Wrapped in Rice Noodles. The freshly made noodle sheets practically bounce in your mouth, while the shrimp snaps, and the sweetened soy sauce is just the right top off.My mom's all-time favorite is Fish Balls. The steamed spheres are light and bouncy, served with a sprinkle of pepper. Unlike the ones I've had elsewhere, these had bits of pork in it, which made Lon love them even more. (We had them cut several different items in halves because we had 6 people.)The skins on the Chive Dumplings were a bit too thick this time, but the filling was still richly aromatic.I had these Chicken Meatballs with Sticky Rice Coating last time, and I had to have it again. The wonderfully tender meat is flavored with Chinese black mushroom, a nice combination of light flavors.We also had the beef meatballs, a nice throwback for me, since my mom made these a lot when we were little kids. These are not like Italian meatballs because there is no bread/bread crumbs in it, and it is steamed. The texture ends up being a bit bouncy and less crumbly.Baby Chinese Broccoli is one of my favorite vegetables but restaurants always use more oil than I do at home. You usually only get one shot at getting greens at dim sum though, so just grab the green dish you see. It's still pretty good.Here comes the clam cart, which always catches my brother's eye. These were great, tender little Clams in Balck Bean Sauce, perfectly cooked.The Shrimp Stuffed Fried Tofu was nicely fried, leaving a thin crispy outside, with a very tender inside. However, it lacked flavor and the accompanying dipping sauce was extra oily.The Peppery Beef Ribs served on the bone is a simple meat dish cooked just right.The Roast Pork Buns were decent but I've had a lot better. The dough was not as soft as it could be and the meat was not as meaty, if that makes sense?The Vegetarian Tofu Skin Wrap is a nice layering of textures, the jelly fish-like cloud ears, the al dente shredded veggies, and the very thin but strong tofu skins, that all soak up sauce well.Lon's mom was really enjoying the tofu skins so we got another kind filled with chicken, ham, and black mushrooms. Also good.Pea Shoot and Shrimp Dumplings, another one I had last time, that I wanted again. The chewy skins, fresh shrimp, and unique pea shoot flavor, just makes a perfect dumpling for me.The Silken Tofu was as silky as expected. It was only missing the ginger syrup most places serve it with.The Sticky Rice in Lotus Leaves were smaller than normal but the advantage of less sticky rice and meat is that it absorbs more lotus leaf flavor/aroma. I'm happy to trade size for quality.These light and fluffy, egg-flavored, mini cake rolls, are lightly sweet, and freshly steamed. YumThese Sesame Balls are better described as sesame coated and lotus paste filled, mochi-like balls. I prefer the ones with red bean paste but those are hard to find these days. These are a great item when served hot. The outside will be crispy from the sesame coating, but chewy from the mochi-like dough, and sweet from the soft paste inside. The problem is that these taste horrible when cold, like most fried foods. Ours were warm today, not optimal, but still decent.With just a few complaints, and most of the food pleasing our table, we would all come back. The place is bustling with people, allowing quick turn-over, ensuring fresh food. The variety is impressive, with a good ratio of classics and favorites to unique creations or variations. Jade Asian Restaurant is also a much nicer looking restaurant that many others in Flushing, so it's a good place to take guests.

You had me salivating at the very first pic! I love shrimp (or practically any meat, but shrimp is the best) wrapped in rice noodles, esp when the noodles are made well and give that bouncy texture you describe. And that sweet soy sauce they pour on the noodles...yeah I could eat my shoe with that.So is it your opinion that the best Chinese food in NYC is in Flushing? What's your favorite place in Manhattan, and how does it compare to your favorite place in Flushing?
Jessica@Foodmayhem
2008-04-06 19:17:00
I do think there's better Chinese Food in Flushing. It would be hard to chose a favorite there because there's so many good places.In Manhattan, it would be Congee Village (Allen Street location) for Cantonese or New Yeah Shanghai for Shanghainese.Will you be going to Flushing, when you come to NY?
Sheng
2008-04-06 21:44:00
Sadly, no I don't think we can fit in a trip to Flushing this time. We do have 2 meals planned in Manhattan Chinatown -- Bo Ky and New Green Bo/Yeah Shanghai. My sister is coming into town from Philly for a day just to get soup dumplings. I only recently realized that the Shanghainese places are right around the corner from each other, so we're gonna try to do a side-by-side taste test. Next time, Flushing will be a must-go destination. I'd also really like to visit a place that does Sichuan hot pot and a place that does traditional hand-pulled noodles. There's too many wonderful places in NYC! I'm so jealous of you guys!

I plan on being in manhattan next month possibly (can't wait!) - so what is THE BEST place for Chinese in that area?I have had awful Chinese food here - do you suggest New Yeah Shanghai?  I am looking for fresh, spicy and noodles too - dim sum would be great if you know of a place in manhattan.I love this post -looks delicious!
Jessica@Foodmayhem
2008-04-09 09:24:00
Taste Memory, I'm glad you're coming to New York. It sounds like you have to do the cooking if you want good food down there.I do recommend New Yeah Shanghai for things like soup dumplings and other dumplings. I recommend Congee Village for Cantonese style food and for spicy you need Sichuan/Szechuan food. Again, better in Flushing but I like this place in Manhattan enough, Wu Liang Ye. For noodles, I'm going to try a handmade noodles place, that seems promising, on Fri, so stay tuned for that review.
Jessica@Foodmayhem
2008-04-10 10:05:00

Spicy Chicken Tortilla Soup
CONTENT
This recipe is the result of things in my fridge that I wanted to use up, which happens pretty often. I made a whole roasted chicken (about 3 pounds) a few nights ago but I'm not a big fan of white meat chicken so we just ate the legs and wings. This recipe uses the left over meat and the bones. I also had a large container of salsa from the bachelorette party weekend and I wanted to use that too. It was a spicy salsa so keep in mind that your soup will be more or less spicy depending on the salsa you use.Spicy Chicken Tortilla Soup1. Heat oil in a large pot. Sweat the onions, garlic, and peppers until soft.2. Add salsa, chili powder, cumin, and dried cilantro. Stir until evenly mixed.3. Add chicken broth and chicken bones, bring to a boil.4. Add cream style corn and black beans and bring to a boil again. (This may be a good time to preheat the oven for the tortillas.)5. Turn down to a simmer and cook covered for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. During this time, you can make the tortillas.)6. Add chicken meat to soup and cook for 15 minutes. (You can put the tortillas in the oven now and they will be done at the same time as the soup.)7. Remove the bones from the soup. Serve soup with tortillas.TortillasPreheat the oven to 350 degrees. Stir together the olive oil, granulated garlic, and lime powder. Brush on both sides of each tortilla. Cut into 4 strips or wedges and lay on a baking sheet. Sprinkle with salt and paprika. Bake for 15 minutes.Garnishes - There are a few garnishes that come to mind that would enhance this soup but for one reason or the other, I have not chosen to use them but if you like any of these, throw them on.*Note: Keep in mind that I made enough tortillas for Lon and I to eat with the soup for one meal. There's enough soup for several meals though so if you're serving to a group, you'll have to double or triple the tortilla portion of the recipe.

Love your blog!  Congratulations on your upcoming wedding!Your spicy chicken tortilla soup sounds fabulous and easy peasy!  Along this vein, I highly recommend La Esquina (a downtown taqueria).  They have a very satisfying and homey tortilla soup, the best tacos on THIS coast and grilled Mexican corn that will leave you wanting more.Cheers!

The Bean Coffee and Tea

I go around sampling coffee all the time, often just picking up a cup whenever I happen to walk by a new spot. Last time, I was walking home from the Vet, I stopped in at Royale. This time, I made a mental note to stop by The Bean Coffee & Tea The Bean Coffee & Tea. The atmosphere was nice and relaxed. The counter girl was friendly, and the pastries and cakes looked fresh and enticing. They had this bowl made of chocolate, filled with custard and fresh berries, that really caught my eye. The real test for me is the regular standard coffee though, and on that note, I probably won't be back. The coffee was not much better than Starbucks coffee, less acidic but just as burnt. It went in the garbage about a block away. At the risk of sounding like an old grandma - If I had a nickel for every time I threw out a cup of coffee....

Fong Li Su - Pineapple Cakes
CONTENT
Here's another tasty treat, my mom brought home from Taiwan, Fong Li Su, or pineapple cakes. It's another one of those goodies that are available here in the states but just don't taste as good. This one, I don't understand, because they are pre-packaged anyway. Just send them over, right?The Fong Li Su are usually rectangular (I cut it in half to show you the inside.) and are traditionally made with a pineapple filling. There are several variations now with strawberry, melon, etc. but the classic one is what my mom always buys. The ones from Taiwan just taste a lot fresher. The shortbread-like outside is light and crumbly and needs the dense pineapple jam to hold it together. It is an extremely densely caloric treat that accomplishes the illusion of barely feeling like you ate, if it's a good one. The ones I've bought here feel dense and chewy, and they're usually sweeter too, so I don't buy them anymore. I just wait for them to arrive from Taiwan.

Pineapple cake was a childhood treat of mine. I love the contrasting textures between the crumbly/caky exterior and the sweet gooey interior. I'm curious to know what the other flavors are like, though I imagine pineapple would still be my sentimental favorite. I agree that the ones I've recently tried at the Asian markets leave a little something to be desired. I wonder if it'd be possible to reproduce a better version at home, using a shortbread dough and a pineapple simple syrup thickened with corn syrup and/or gelatin. Pastry is out of my expertise though, so it would likely end in disaster in my hands.Just want to also add that I've been enjoying your blog for a while now. Looking forward to meeting you  fellow foodies soon!

I love getting treats from overseas. There are so many things that never make it here. And as you mentioned even if they sell similar stuff in the States it just never taste quite the same. When my mom goes to Asia or friends go away for vacation and ask me what I want, I always have one answer...food. For example, I love the chips from England. People always think I'm nuts when I carry bags of potato chips home with me on the plane. But, they just have so many unique flavors and don't taste like chips here. Another thing I like from Asia that they don't have in the states is Campbell's borscht soup. Last time Sara and I visited Hong Kong, we lugged home about 10 cans and treated them like rare truffles or something. I've done some extensive research to try to buy it online and even written Campbell emails requesting they sell it in the states, but my requests have yet to be answered.

Fresh Direct Raisin Pecan Loaf
CONTENT
About a year ago, I was complaining about how the Fresh Direct Ciabatta Rolls had gotten smaller and more expensive. I have to admit, I still buy them, because I don't know of anywhere else to get parbaked breads and I just love the concept. You pop a parbaked bread in your oven for 15-20 minutes, and you've got warm bread that tastes freshly baked. This time, we tried a Raisin Pecan Loaf, and it was great, crusty outside, soft, chewy, and dense, inside, packed with raisins and just the right amount of pecans.Be aware that this Raisin Pecan Loaf is very addictive. It ruined a perfectly healthy meal by adding nearly half a loaf of bread to it. I just couldn't stop eating it...and with some sweet cream butter...you're ready for couch potato heaven.

Whole Foods has par-baked ciabatta and French bread in their freezer section, and Trader Joes has some too, though not frozen. I haven't tried the latter, but the ciabatta at WF was comparable in quality and was also about the same price.

Oops.  I ate the entire Raisin Pecan bread!  I sliced it piece by piece, applying soft butter and kosher salt and devoured it.  Generally, I can not stand nuts in bread, but I couldn't taste any of them and focused on those yummy raisins.

I get the mini baguettes at Whole Foods.  The mini ones are a great size for two people and you get two in a package.  With the smaller size, you still get your tasty hot bread but don't have to feel guilty if you eat the whole thing. In other words you get to have your bread and eat it too! Scott and his mom love them. He can eat a whole package at one sitting epecially when there is yummy sauce to soak up. Oh...They are also really yummy to make sandwiches with. Nothing beats hot toasty bread. The raisin pecan loaf looks delicious. Next time you order can you order one for me?

We both looked at each other and went, \"Yuck!\" He tried the Acai-Blueberry & Lime with chocolate and thought the flavor combination was nauseating. I tried the Nutty Pomegranate & Cranberry with chocolate, and it just tasted really healthy, like I'd eat it if it was a cure for some ailment, but not as food. The Aristo Wellness Bars are packed with Omega 3's, plant sterols, and anti-oxidants, but like I've said before, I don't do yucky diet food.

Jess - if you find a good nutritional bar, let me know.  I just eat protein bars from Bally's and they're not the most appetizing.

We like the zone bars.  Especially chocolate peanut butter. And now they make a smaller size (~80 cals) which is great because Kasi has a tendency to only need 1/2 a zone when she needs a big snack.

I finally had a chance to try out one of these bars the other day.  I tried the Orange & Goji flavored bar.I wasn't expecting much as most health bars just taste horrible. I was pleasantly surprised with the initial taste and then *SMACK*, it hit me hard. The foul taste overwhelmed my taste buds.I'm not sure why companies insist on trying to market things that people know don't taste good as "great tasting". When you try to cover up a taste with another it's generally a bad idea. Just like cough medicine, but that's a whole other can of worms.In this case it tasted like what I would imagine a compost heap comprised of citrus fruits would taste like, complete with the protein goodness of insects.Probably healthy, but you ain't fooling me with "great tasting" and swapping "health" with "wellness".

I tried the Aristo Pomegranate kind today and i thought it tasted ok...better than some flavors I've had before but still I'm not sure...it reminds me of some fruit and nut cake. Haha. It's loaded with way more nuts than I thought were going to be in there. And the bits of pomegranate in the bar reminded me more of dried cranberries than pomegranate. I would eat this if it would do some crazy awesome thing to my body. But as for now looks like I'll continue my search for the great bar.

Spritz Cookies
CONTENT
Spritz Cookies are wonderfully versatile. When you want to make it look like you've made different cookies, when you really made just one, make a batch of Spritz cookies in different shapes. I used a cookie press for the first time (deprived childhood right?) and it was harder that I thought. Several shapes just did not work, but I managed to salvage a few so I could make more variations, again, we're trying to make it look like different cookies....I think you get the idea.

I have less than two months till our wedding day, so FoodMayhem is going to have to be lighter. I'll be trying to make healthier meals, less dessert, and eating out less. This is going to be near impossible for me as I think about all the things I want to make. I'm watching Giada on TV right now make some yummy looking fried ravioli. Next, she's doing zeppoles! Yesterday, Paula Dean and her sons were on the Ellen Degeneres Show, and they made a peanut butter and banana sandwich that was battered and dipped in granola and fried. Oh Boy!Don't worry, things will still be delicious because I don't do yucky, diet food.

A Sushi Yasuda Quickie - 4th visit
CONTENT
Since I've posted about Sushi Yasuda so many times already, I'll make this quick and just talk about the three new fish I tried this time. The Red Fish, in the same family as White fish, was not interesting to me, which isn't surprising since I don't appreciate White Fish in sushi form. Below is a photo of the lower beak from a Needle Fish, made more appealing because of how beautiful it is. The expert scoring helps enhance the texture as well.The Wild Eel from Florida, cooked to order, was a lovely way to end the meal. It was so tender and something you should definitely try, when available.If you haven't made your way to Sushi Yasuda yet, what are you waiting for?

Sushi isn't all that photogenic, is it?  Or maybe it looks very tastey, but since I don't do seafood, it looks more like a photo of a specimen or bait.  So, to the fish eaters out there, I ask...does the sushi in the photos appear appetizing?

Shirako is more accurately defined as the "milt".  It is the internal semen producing organs of the male fish.  It's kinda like fish pudding with a custardy texture and a light gamey / fishy flavor.  Mine was from stripped bass and served in bonito broth and eaten with chopsticks.  Like I said, I probably wouldn't have it again unless it was the December cod (the best season for the best shirako), I still want to try that.

Quick Chinese Chicken Corn Soup

This is one of my favorite childhood soups. I asked my mom to make it all the time, and after dinner (traditionally, Chinese drink soup after the meal) I would drink 3 bowls. My mom makes a home-made chicken broth, which of course yields a better result, but here's a quick version that still satisfies me when I want a taste of home.Quick Chinese Chicken Corn Soup1. Heat cream style corn and chicken broth in a 3 1/2 quart pot over high heat until boiling.2. Turn down to a simmer and stir in beaten eggs. Continue stirring for another minute and continue to simmer for 3 minutes.3. Mix cornstarch and water to form a slurry. Stir into the soup and simmer for another 3 minutes, continuously stirring. Add salt and pepper. Serve.Whatever you don't finish can be stored in the fridge and reheated.

Sao Bing

Sao Bing is a traditional Chinese bread, flaky, layered, deliciousness. It's most commonly eaten with fried dough crullers (you tiao) inside and soy bean milk. You can buy Sao Bing in Flushing and Chinatown but it's not exactly the same as the ones in Taiwan (which tend to have scallions in the dough). It's the food my mom misses most so she always brings some back.Of course my mom gave us some so I made scallion omelets to sandwich inside. That is a classic way to eat it but not as popular as You Tiao or cold sliced beef.I wish I had more Sao Bing so I can make some fusion sandwiches, a grilled cheese, rare roast beef, egg salad, yum.....

Bouley Bakery Market

I went to see an allergist yesterday and lucky me, it was right by Bouley Bakery Market Bouley Bakery Market. You already know that I love brunch at Bouley, so I went looking for that apple bread I had. They don't sell the little rolls that they give you at brunch but you can buy a larger one. It's a little pricey at $5 and change but worth it. Lon and I ate the whole thing last night.Since I was in the shop, I wanted to try a few more things, so I got these adorable little mini muffin/cakes. It had a fancy French name but I don't remember it now. Lon and I didn't care for the chocolate one because the chocolate chips inside were too hard. Lon liked the pineapple, which was too sweet for me, and we both liked the cherry pistachio. The tartness of the cherry balances the sweetness of the cake. They're cute and fun but nothing spectacular.I have to go back to the allergist next week so if anyone has any favorite items at Bouley Bakery Market, let me know.

Totally Baked - One Potato, Two Potato, Three Potato....
CONTENT
We thought we'd check out Totally Baked Totally Baked on opening day. The well designed space was filled with people on a rainy day, so good job to the publicist. They seem to be working out some logistical kinks as the wait was quite long, and Melinda's (Lon's co-worker) order got lost (They gave her an extra baked potato and a drink for that). The owners and involved parties were all there to schmooze with the crowd so I learned that Chef & Company (the catering company that previously occupied this retail space) was still behind the scenes of this operation.Before I get to the spuds, the packaging was great and I was glad to see that it was made of recycled cardboard. I have to wonder though, how much it added to the prices because the potatoes are quite pricey (most are $9 and up). My Cape Cod Chowder Baked Potato was good, a creamy combination of flavors, topped with onions for another texture. All potatoes were packed with a fresh side salad.Lon ordered the Brisket Baked Potato and loved the perfectly cooked brisket, but seemed uninterested in the potato.He was way more interested in his Sweet \"Spa\" Potato, topped with cottage cheese, maple syrup, crunchy praline and banana caramel. I liked it more than I expected, since I'm not a fan of cottage cheese. The dessert potatoes were a great idea in concept alone, so points there.Lon and I agreed that the toppings were good, made with good ingredients and cooked correctly, flavors were well thought out, creative yet satisfied the parameters of a baked potato. The problem is that each person from his office had to get two potatoes to call it lunch. Two potatoes and a drink will sink about 20 bucks.

New York can be expensive but when you know where to go, you can eat great stuff pretty cheaply. Most of the people I know, who eat lunch out regularly, try to keep it under $10.It'll be interesting to see if they lower their prices or increase their portions. I'll keep you updated.

Wedding Menu Tasting
CONTENT
Carlyle on the Green handles their tastings a little differently. We were invited to have dinner in The Oak Room, the restaurant of their country club, where several menu items overlap with choices you have on the wedding menu. We tried three appetizers, three entrees, and dessert, asked our wonderful server, Andrew, many questions, and now we have a ton of notes for menu planning.The crab cakes were problematic for us. First, they were not lump crab meat, as listed. We didn't like that they were battered and deep-fried, and very wet inside. Lon was bothered by the overwhelming flavor of roasted red peppers. We both loved the corn salsa.The sesame crusted tuna was seared nicely and evenly but we did not feel that it was sushi-grade as described to us. It was under-seasoned but the salad and dressing was nice.The Mozzarella and Tomato Tower was topped with a delicious balsamic drizzle and garden fresh basil. The mozzarella was too cold and therefore too hard. It needs to be brought closer to room temperature for optimal texture.The generous portion of Filet Mignon was pretty good (we asked for rare and got a nice medium rare) and served with a nice Merlot Sauce. Lon loved the fried onions, except that they were cold. The mashed potato was good. The vegetables were way too oily and over-cooked.The Duck Legs were disappointing, over-cooked and stringy. The skin was soft, not crispy. The raspberry sauce was a nice flavor and we loved the sweet potato mash. Again, mushy vegetables.The lamb chops were cooked a bit unevenly, a few pieces were past the medium-rare we had asked for, but I enjoyed the slightly minted dijon sauce. The same mashed potatoes and veggies accompanied this dish.By now, we were stuffed. We asked for a small portion of dessert and got a giant plate. Lon liked the cheesecake but I thought it was salty. The molten chocolate cake was standard and the banana foster wasn't really a foster but bananas are always yummy to us. The ice cream cookie was the best.Whoever, came up with this dessert deserves an award. The cookie was like a thin layer of granola bar, perfect for holding the vanilla ice cream, because it was strong yet chewy, so that it didn't push out the ice cream. It was then dipped in chocolate.Generally, the plates were all arranged nicely and portions were really large. Some items need work and now that we have our notes, we're probably going to be the biggest pain their chef has ever seen.

Sesame Coins
CONTENT
Cookies travel well, so they're one of the best things to make if you have to bring it somewhere. Today, we were heading out to Long Island to see Uncle Howard and Aunt Ilene, and I wanted to bring a light cookie. I flipped through Great Cookies, by Carole Walter, and chose Sesame Coins. They came out just as expected, a light cookie, perfect for tea.As I was making the cookies, it occurred to me that I could try a few with black sesame seeds. They taste a little different but still delectable, and I love the contrasting colors next to each other.

Invitations from a Foodie Wedding
CONTENT
We recently sent out invitations for our upcoming wedding. Like others before us, we included a phrase that we thought best represented our feelings. The original quote was from Harriet Van Horne; however, we flipped around the first line to fit our needs. Our saying was:Jessica and I love each other and we love cooking -- we see many parallels between the two affinities. In both, the basis for starting is instinctual and the result is a special treat. Like food preferences, everyone has their special taste in a significant other. To achieve a great result in either it takes a little luck and a lot of understanding.And as anyone who has been in a relationship or in the kitchen knows, there can be times of trouble. And usually those troubles can be resolved with work and dedication. We're looking forward to the challenge and the delicious result!

The knife, what beef and scallop pic?Delectabill, Ice (our dog's name) is sitting in the pot because it was our way of trying to put all that we love, in the picture. Ice steals the show though.

From our perspective, the dog is not in the pot as much as the pot is outside of the dog.  We're so existential.

Totally Baked
CONTENT
Lon and I were walking to Paper Presentation and saw a new food spot opening up. It looks like we'll have a baked potato bar in our neighborhood, starting this Monday. We snagged a menu from Totally Baked Totally Baked so we could plan our method of attack.We won't be getting the $55 Truffle Potato, with truffle compound butter, truffle oil, truffle salt, and fresh truffle shavings, but several others sound enticing. The Cape Cod Chowder tops a potato with creamed cod and potato, sauteed onions, parsley, garlic, and grated manchego. The Pulled Pork and The Brisket with marsala reduction sound good too, and of course they have the standards like broccoli and cheddar. You can make your own potato or go for a sweet one like Sweet Potato topped with spiced pecans, marshmallows, nutmeg, and maple syrup drizzle.There's so many that sound good so I'm making Lon meet me there for lunch on Monday with some of his co-workers so I can try a few. I hope it's good cause I love a good baked potato. Stay tuned for a proper review of this restaurant on Monday.

The toppings sound very inventive but I wonder if limiting the product base to only baked taters (i.e. no pasta option) is a good idea - it sounds a bit limited.  Let us know if they survive.Do you have any speculation as to if the ratio of failed reataurant starts is higher or lower in NYC compared to other cities?
Jessica@Foodmayhem
2008-03-30 08:40:00
Specialty stores with just one type of product are very popular in NYC. Examples of ones that do well: Bear Papa's (cream puffs), Doughnut Plant,      The Original Soupman. Totally Baked does have salads and two soups on their menu.The ratio of failed restaurants here is probably higher just because rents are ridiculous.

Steak Frites
CONTENT
Lily's send off party was held at Steak Frites Steak Frites, at the new location in Tribeca. I never went to the previous Union Square location, but I heard it was quite popular. I wonder if it was better in the original spot because Lon and I were pretty disappointed in this experience, and others voiced complaints as well.Our 14 person party reserved the private room which was lined with wine rack cases. I thought it was cool at first but realized how impractical it was as wait staff came in and out to grab wine. Each time, they had to open the glass doors in inadequate space. Lon noticed the instrumental latin music as soon as we sat, but it switched to hip hop, then video game instrumentals, Michael Jackson, and then was shut off when the ultra loud live music (Thurs, Fri, Sat at 9:30PM) began.Our first taste impression was the cumin flavored mayonnaise. It was just weird as an accompaniment to bread, and I stared at it for a while since it took a long time for the appetizers to come, and half of us were served a good 5-10 minutes before the other half. Lon and I chose a special, Little Neck Clams with Bacon. They were fresh and plump clams with visible chunks of bacon that did not add any flavor. The liquid that we would normally sop up with bread was so salty, we left it alone.My main course was Pan Seared Scallops with Lobster and Spring Vegetable Risotto. The scallops tasted like nothing. I only ate two out of three, which has never happened before. The risotto was like steam table food, the stuff that sits on a buffet table for hours, with an over-powering taste of asparagus and carrots. You could see the flecks of lobster but could not taste it. My mom would have had a heart attack if she saw how much food I left on my plate.Lon's report of his Bouillabaisse was not much better. Most of the seafood was over-cooked until chewy. The familiar flavors of bouillabaisse were not there in the murky brown liquid. Uncharacteristic of Lon, he didn't finish his dish either.We had high hopes for the sides. Lon's eyes widened when he saw Duck Fat Hash Browns and pointed out the Truffle Fries, he knew I would want. The Hash Browns were decent fried potatoes but the duck fat was not evident.The Truffle Fries came out cold with a hint of truffle and we sent them back. (Others talked about their cold onion rings.) The new plate was freshly fried, nice and hot, but the truffle flavor was gone, making them just a plate of decent fries. Some pieces were crispy, some were soggy.The focus here seems to be large portions of lovely looking food, in a modern bistro space. If you eat with your eyes, this may be the place for you, but Lon and I will not be back. Flavor is just too important to us.

In regards to the Lily's party comment...the "Mayonnaise" they refered to is Eggplant Hummus, and they clearly don't know what they are tasting. The scallops in the picture clearly have fluer de sel on them and I know the chef would NEVER use a steam table for any food, never mind risotto. This review was a clear insult to the people that work hard at the restaurant to make things better. If your going to comment on other peoples food, at least act as if you know what you are talking about, as I'm sure many people agree you are full of it. So please tell LON and JESSICA to stop being so nitpicky and just enjoy their meal, or say something while you are there to get it fixed. After the fact, don't complain and not give the restaurant a chance to make up for it.

Maybe anonymous didn't read as carefully as I tend to, but the comment was that the risotto tasted like steam table food, not that it was steam table food.  And...I noticed that Lon & Jessica did comment about sending back some of the dishes.

Mini Carrot Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting
CONTENT
My friend Lily is moving away so I had to send her off with a treat. I love mini cupcakes and I love giving mini cupcakes. So, I decided on an apple/carrot spice flavor but you can't taste the apple so I'm calling them Carrot Spice Cupcakes. I am so impressed with this recipe, as a first try. I would only change one thing, remove the nuts. The texture of the cupcakes is so light and tender that the crunch of nuts seems not to fit in. I will definitely be making these again (sans nuts).Mini Carrot Spice Cupcakes~makes about 40 mini cupcakes1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Spray mini muffin pan with non-stick (Pam).2. Beat eggs, white sugar, and brown sugar in a large bowl. Mix in the oil and vanilla, until completely blended. Mix in carrots and apple.3. In a separate bowl, mix the flour, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, and ginger. Fold the flour mixture into the carrot mixture until even. Do not over mix. Fold in walnuts.4. Spoon into prepared muffin pan and bake for 12 minutes or until toothpick comes out clean.5. Cool in pan for 10 minutes before un-molding. Cool completely before frosting.These cupcakes are so good on their own. I couldn't stop eating them. I did add a cream cheese frosting (half the recipe will frost about 30 mini cupcakes), more for the look, to give to Lily, because a cupcake just doesn't look complete without the little frosting hat.Bye Lily, hope to eat with you again soon!

I love Carrot Cake - are these similar to Carrot Cake?  2nd question - what substitutions can you offer to make them lower in fat and higher in fiber?  3rd question - totally unrelated - what can you tell me about buying, storing, and cooking with lemon grass?  You're a foodie.  You love Asian food.  I figure that you're a good source.  So spill it.PS  Feeling better yet?
Jessica@Foodmayhem
2008-03-28 22:56:00
These are similar to carrot cake and you can experiment with adding wheat germ for fiber and cutting back a bit on oil. Personally, I would rather eat them without frosting, instead of changing the recipe.I'm sorry to tell you that I can't help you with lemon grass. I have no experience with it, possibly because my mom hates it....and I am feeling much better. Thank You!

Cooking/Baking flaxseed may destroy or alter the Omega fatty acids. There are mixed reports on this.....so Lon and I stick with flaxseed oil (kept in our fridge) that we drizzle on to salad.

Lamb Shanks and Fresh Gnocchi
CONTENT
I'm finally feeling a bit better, not yet 100%, but I had just enough energy to make a home-cooked dinner last night. I tried this recipe for lamb shanks from Bon Appetit, and it was great. Definitely, one to serve to guests. It does take some time to make, but your kitchen will smell like heaven the whole time and you'll get a beautiful display of meat that falls off the bone, and sauce you want to drink.Kind of last minute, I decided on making gnocchi to go with it. I didn't write down the recipe since this is my first time making gnocchi. (Crazy right?) I kind of assumed it would be a work-in-progress. Now, I'm sad because it was actually really good. They were light and fluffy, melt-in-your-mouth pillows. I served it with left-over sauce from when I made oxtails. (There's no oxtails left, just a little bit of red sauce, and having good red sauce on hand is always a life-saver.)This meal totally exceeded my expectations. I was just hoping for Lon to be happy that he didn't have to eat take-out again but he complimented me repeatedly during the meal and said it's one of the best meals he's had in a long time. My cousin Olivia was impressed too.

Jessica@Foodmayhem
2008-03-28 13:45:00
Welcome Snappy,Gnocchi is an Italian potato pasta/dumpling. Technically, it can also be made of semolina instead of potato but most of the time (at least in the US) we're referring to the potato ones. You eat them just like another shape of pasta. When they're made right, they are light and fluffy. Too often, they are made badly, and are too gummy.

How Do You Eat a Bag of Chips?
CONTENT
I have a strange way of eating potato chips, pretzels, tortilla chips, any of that stuff. I go through a bag by eating the broken ones first, saving the whole ones for last. I do it in a somewhat obsessive way, often eating way more than I wanted to because I'm still on my mission to eat out all the broken ones. I didn't even realize I was doing this until I had to explain myself to Lon, who was watching me rummage through a bag of chips, as if I was digging for treasure. Any psych people out there? Do I have a problem?I recently found out that my friend Sarah does the same thing and our other friend Monica, does the opposite, eating whole pieces first. What does this all mean?How do you eat your chips?

I must be bi-polar then, haha!  It depends on my mood, but I definitely eat methodically as well - either I attack the whole pieces first or I attack the broken ones first.  Another thing is if we're eating family style, I will pick the broken piece for myself and leave the nicer piece for my friends/family.Yes, I'd be interested to see what this all means.  Probably simply shows whether you've got an anal personality or not.  =P

I do a similar thing with potatoe chips I actually have to find just the right sized chip be it broke or whole to be dipped in ranch dip. And I won't eat chips without dip.I also noticed myself eating salad methodically. Eating it from left to right until it is completely gone. I will work on the portion I was working on until you can see the barel plate (I wont pick at other parts) then i will move on to the next section.Hello OCD. =]
TroyBoy
2008-03-27 20:14:00
Hmmm.  I don;t go finatic over my chips, but I do eat one item on my plate until it's gone before moving on to the text.  Maybe we're not all that odd afterall?
JP
2008-03-27 21:39:00
I go straight for the whole ones, then finish off with the cracked ones.But, if the bag has a mix of different items like Frito-Lay's Munchies (Doritos, Sunchips, pretzels, cheetos), then I eat the ones i like the least first.  I start with eating all the pretzels.  Then, the cheetos.  Followed by the SunChips and ending with the Doritos.

Hey Jess, I also like saving the best for last! And I just mentioned that to Monica and asked her if she did the same, and she said that if she was eating a bag by herself she would eat the less desirable first, but if she was sharing with someone else, she'd eat the most desirable first.Hmm...I think we can draw some conclusions here, dontcha think?

I don't have a particular order I eat chips, but when it comes to Twix bars you bet I do. First, I like to slowly eat off all the caramel on top. Then I work my way around the cookie and eat off the chocolate and then once the chocolate is cleaned off I eat the shortbread part.I know, weird right? Not sure where I got the habit, but that's just my twix eating routine and I don't think I could eat it any other way.

Baking like a Scientist
CONTENT
Baking is a science where measurements are very important. Sometimes, friends will say to me, \"I made this recipe for bread and it didn't work.\" I start asking questions to find out more about why it didn't work and it turns out that they substituted whole wheat flour for all-purpose flour. That may or may not be the only reason it didn't work (because there are a lot of factors that affect bread) but when you use whole wheat flour, you often need more water so you can't just use the same recipe that's made for all-purpose flour. It will also certainly taste and feel different.I'm not saying that you can never substitute or don't experiment but start to think about baking as chemistry and you will see the difference. Here's an extremely helpful guide for baking substitutions, from The Joy of Baking, recommended by my mentor, Carol Gelles.

Chinese Cough Remedy
CONTENT
My sore throat is slowly turning into an itchy dry cough. As you can imagine, that's pretty painful, with the sore throat still lingering. When I'm sick, I think of my mom and how she used to chase me with those horrid Chinese herbal remedies. But, whenever I had a cough, I was standing in front of her displaying my symptoms, because I wanted one of her two cough remedies.The first being this thick black syrupy substance called, Chuan Bei Pi Pa Gao. It's sweet, a bit fruity, and a little minty. It's delicious and extremely effective for reducing phlegm and coughing. Sometimes, my cousins and I would fake a cough to get a spoonful of this stuff. Unfortunately, I don't have any on hand.The other remedy is a poached Bosc pear (my mom says Bosc works best). Just peel, split in half, and core. Simmer in about 1 1/2 cups water with a 1 1/2″ cube of rock sugar, until the liquid is a little syrupy. It will take about 30 minutes. Eat the pear and drink the liquid warm. There's no scientific proof that this remedy works but I think it does. At the very least, it's a nice bedtime dessert.

While walking my Jack Russell, I stumbled across a new place opening on 16th Street, where Steak Frites used to be. The glass doors read Cafe Society Cafe Society and CSNY. While the space has enough tables and seats for a full-fledged restaurant, the decor looks more like a modern bar/lounge. I didn't see any menus and there are still guys working on the space but they told me the bar will be open tonight. Let me know if anyone checks it out.

The husband and I had dinner at Cafe Society last night. We frequently dined at the old Steak Frites and were curious to try CSNY. The footprint is the same, but the interior has been completely revamped. Gone is the worn but charming bistro and in it's place a sleek new design. The new upholstered chairs are comfortable, but with some many cramped into the dining area, it's very difficult to maneuver between tables.The service was good, the menu (temporarily) limited and the prices have been increased considerably. I had the $25 scallop dish, which consisted of 3 little scallops on a bed of lemon risotto. There was a schmear of something on the plate that may have been plum sauce. I enjoyed it. And my husband enjoyed his little overpriced chicken with little morrels.But I miss the old Steak Frites. We tried it in the new location and the menu has changed considerably as well. Oh well, C'Est la Vie!

Sura: The King's Meal
CONTENT
I'm still stuck at home, sick of all the soup places I've ordered from. I'm desperately searching for a new one when Lon tells me there's another Korean place by our apartment, Sura: The King's Meal Sura: The King's Meal. Well, the name certainly set's up expectations and the fact that Chef Suk Yong Chung comes from Hangawi Hangawi. I've never been before but it's a place in K-town so I'm sort of anticipating the delivery of an authentic Korean meal. I ordered the Sundubu Jiggae (spicy tofu stew) and the Kimchee Jigae (pork and kimchee stew), a bit overly zealous for one sick person, but hey I'm suffering.It's 35 minutes later and I'm still waiting for the food that I couldn't pay for by credit card (they have a $20 minimum)...Finally got the food, 44 minutes after the order was placed, and there's soup all over the containers and the utensils. I wipe them quickly and notice that the portions are about half the size of what most places offer. They did give generous portions of the multi-grain rice and the lunch prices are a bit lower so, I'll call that even. The problem is that my Sundubu isn't hot anymore. Such a peeve of mine! Flavor is pretty standard but the squid stands out. It is nicely cooked, fresh squid, not that frozen stuff some places put in their sundubu.The Kimchee Jiggae was also just warm but that's the least of it's problems. It doesn't taste like Kimchee Jiggae to me and has rice cakes in it. I could be down for this new inventive version if the rice cakes weren't over-cooked and the whole thing wasn't so dang salty, near inedible. (Keep in mind, Nima got kicked off of Top Chef in the first episode of this season for that. )Like Dosirak, Sura only gives Kimchee, no other panchan. (I hope this isn't going to be a trend.) The kimchee isn't even good, the least flavorful I have ever tasted, and not spicy. It's basically just cabbage sitting in salted red liquid. Overall, it was a train wreck with too few redeeming qualities. I won't be ordering again.

Steamed Eggs
CONTENT
For the last week, I've been struggling with what to eat each day. It's hard to feel inspired when you're sick. But today, I knew exactly what I wanted. I woke up thinking about a steamed egg dish my mom used to make when I was a kid. It's super soft and smooth, light in flavor, and served warm, perfect for a sore throat. I can't believe I hadn't thought of it earlier.Normally, I would call my mom to get the recipe (a recipe from my mom never has any measurements) but she's in Taiwan right now. Luckily, I found a recipe that seemed just like my mom's. It was perfect, just as I remembered it.

WHY is it that asian mom's NEVER give measurements when giving a recipe?!  My mother just rattles off key ingredients and says "you know how to make it".  She doesn't even include all the ingredients - she forgot to tell me to add water to my chinese-style ribs once and when I told her they didn't come out right she told me I was stupid =(.

Who is Padma Lakshmi?
CONTENT
Most foodies know Padma as the host of Top Chef but she's also a former supermodel, somewhat successful actress, and has written two cookbooks. Yes, I'm incredibly envious of her. I'm short, probably will never be in a movie, don't have any published cookbooks, and I don't get to taste all that food on Top Chef. She would be my perfect idol but there's one severe problem. I've watched several episodes of Top Chef, tried to read about her, watched some of her video blogs, and yet I don't get a sense of any personality from her. She seems to be just a gorgeous shell. Anyone else feel this way?

I don't know if calling her a shell is entirely fair.  I say that for two reasons:  1) She may have personal reasons for being somewhat guarded  2) It's not as if she gets a great opportunity to show off a personality on the show.  Case in point:  Gail Simmons, the hostess before Padma, wasn't any more charismatic.Okay, I'll shut up now - just offering a different point of view.
Jessica@Foodmayhem
2008-03-26 23:00:00
I think you can be guarded and still show a personality, and I don't even mean you have to be charismatic. I feel like you can usually even see something through people's eyes, even if they don't say anything. I agree that Gail isn't charismatic but there's a person there. I almost feel like Padma is not really a person. Do you know what I mean?BTW, feel free to disagree any time you want.
Kathy
2008-03-31 10:38:00
Actually it was Katie Lee Joel who was the first hostess, not Gail Simmons.  Gail is still a judge on TC.  And I agree, Katie had zero personality.What I like about Padma is that unlike Katie, she tries the food, she offers suggestions, comments, praise and criticism.  Katie did none of that.At any rate, I do think Padma has personality and may be guarded as suggested.  Her personality does come through in some of the shows (like last seasons breakfast quickfire).  Although I do recall her on the old Food Network show "Melting Pot" and she didn't have much charisma then.  She definitely has more now.

Dosirak
CONTENT
I still have this sore throat that will not go away so I was craving a hot spicy soup, hoping it would burn it out of my throat. For that, I look to Korean food. We ordered from Dosirak Dosirak and I chose the Yukgaejang, shredded flank steak, with scallions and clear noodles, in a very spicy broth. It was just what I needed in a generous portion, made more complete with a bit of kimchee, saltier than usual, sweeter than usual, and less spicy, but I liked it.Unfortunately, Lon's dish was less satisfying. His Bulgolgi Teokbokee, marinated beef with rice cake, vegetables, and ramyeon noodles, was very one dimensional. The very skimpy amount of meat was too sweet and all of it was sitting in an oily, sweet soy sauce.I've eaten at Dosirak once before, several years ago, and I remember the bulgolgi being too sweet then too. I don't remember what else I ate but the real bummer is that Dosirak doesn't give all that panchan that other Korean restaurants do, only kimchee. It took 30 minutes for the delivery, roughly two blocks away, and they are a cash only establishment. The prices have gone up (add up to $2 on any dish listed on menupages) and the food seems hit or miss. Yet, I will still patronize once in a blue moon. Why? Because, I don't have a choice. There is only one other Korean restaurant near me, Express Manna Kitchen, and it's really just a fast food joint that doesn't have a complete Korean menu.

Wedding Favors for Foodies
CONTENT
If you've been reading Foodmayhem, you know that Lon and I are getting married. My wonderful bridesmaid, Angie, found all these adorable wedding favors made just for the food or cooking obsessed. There must be a lot of us out there.My favorite is the adorable heart shaped measuring spoon set, because it is engraved with measurements such as \"a Pinch of Patience\", \"a Dash of Kindness\", \"a Spoonful of Laughter\", and \"A Heap of Love\".Then there's this cute little whisk that could stand alone or go with the heart-shaped egg or pancake mold.There are tons of wine stoppers and corkscrews with hearts and of course the list of edible wedding favors is endless. I love the idea of custom wedding cookies, but at $5 and up per cookie, it's just too much.We promise to tell you what we're doing for our wedding favors, but you'll have to wait till after the wedding.

Carrot Cousins
CONTENT
Happy Easter! In honor of bunnies, lets talk about carrots. We were watching Alton Brown the other night and he mentioned that carrots and cumin were cousins. Wow, never would've thought, but I looked it up, and apparently carrots are in the Umbelliferae family along with dill, caraway, parsnips, parsley, anise, and cumin. Parsnips do look like white carrots, and I guess the tops of carrots do look like parsley, but the rest is quite surprising.Carrots and cumin go really well together so here's a easy carrot salad that's meant to be served as an accompaniment to grilled meats. The sour quality is especially good with spicy meat.Carrot RibbonsWhisk vinegar, cumin, honey, and olive oil together. Toss with carrot ribbons and scallions. Chill for an hour before serving with grilled meat.

Okay, so which would you recomend more, the Carrot Salad or the Purple Apple Slaw?  Or, are they really not all that interchangeable as a side?
Jessica@Foodmayhem
2008-03-24 08:59:00
Not the same kind of side. The Purple Apple Slaw is a true side, like a cole slaw. The Carrot Ribbons are sour and are meant to be eaten by putting a bit on the meat, kind of like sauerkraut or relish.

Je'Bon
CONTENT
I've mentioned Je'bon before, very briefly, and we liked it enough to try again. Of course, we're still ordering-in because I'm sick, so I haven't actually seen the restaurant yet. After reading several positive reviews on menupages about their signature dish, Je'bon, I definitely wanted to try it. It is a seafood noodle soup, packed with seafood (really large shrimp), a light fish broth, and very interesting noodles made with fish. The noodles maintained the chewiness that we love in flour noodles, yet added another dimension by tasting like fish.We also ordered the Aberdeen Noodles, also packed with nicely cooked seafood. You can't see the squid, fish cake (Lon loved), and shrimp on this pictures but it was also pretty generous.We threw in a House Roll (tuna, salmon, yellowtail, avocado, topped with tobiko), which was standard.Je'bon isn't amazing, but it's a good stand-by, considering the portion to price factor and the price range suits delivery food. They have lots of interesting dishes that I don't see elsewhere so it's good for when you're bored of the standard Pan-Asian menu. I will probably order from them again.

Hamachi Slowly Swimming Down Stream
CONTENT
Since the first time I posted about Hamachi Hamachi about two years ago (before Foodmayhem), I have returned several times, and they have slowly declined in my eyes. They were never amazing but a good bang-for-you-buck kind of place. After a while, the sashimi platters started getting a little sloppy and fish was sometimes tendonous. I would meet with friends for lunch there feeling like it was just ok because they had cheap and filling lunch specials.Today, I ordered-in (because I'm still sick) a Yosenabe. It will likely be my last act of patronage to Hamachi. The decision is long overdue. The soup base was boring, tasting mostly like cabbage. The piece of salmon was fishy. The bland white fish and chicken was skimpy and there was no clam although written in the menu description.I finished lunch feeling like I have felt this disappointment at Hamachi before so I need to document this to remind myself that I don't want to go again. We eat at so many places, that I often read my own blog, just to remember what my experience was.

Sorry to hear about your continued disappointment, but am glad to hear that you will no longer support their cause for bland food. Due to the declination of spectacular restaurants around my city and my love for seafood, I recently started looking into having live lobster delivered to my home and I can prepare it the way that I see fit. Sure there's more effort taking this route, but at least in the end there will be a lot more passion put into my food that wasn't there before.http://livelobsterdelivered.wikidot.com/

Mark Bittman is looking for the best cookbooks and you can give your two cents. I have an entire bookshelf of just cookbooks yet I don't use many often so I had to think about this pretty hard. I don't know why I've collected so many cookbooks but here are the few I do use:The Ultimate Diabetes Cookbook by Carol Gelles - I'm not diabetic. It's just that it's a reliable source for healthy good stuff and when I'm feeling uninspired, I know I can get a good fool proof recipe to serve to guests.The Cake Bible by Rose Levy Beranbaum (see I'm not diabetic) is a great go to for cakes.Vegetables by James Peterson is a good reference.

Sadly, this is all I can give you while I'm sick. Halls has a new line of Halls Naturals. We've tried the Sunshine Citrus and the Honey-Lemon Chamomile and we love them. Aside from being all natural (meaning no food coloring for me), I think they taste better than the original Halls menthols, which I think are gross. They have been effectively soothing my throat which is the point, so thumbs up from Foodmayhem!

Sick Food
CONTENT
My friend Sarah, cleverly titled a post on her blog, Fast-food Beer Goggles. It made me laugh when I read it because I instantly knew what she was talking about. I don't need to explain right?I don't have a funny name for why Saltine Crackers suddenly taste so good when you're sick (yes, I think I'm sick again) but I think it has to do with not being able to taste anything but salt. I find myself lying on my couch making a giant mess of crumbs, while savoring saltines like they are fine pastry. A skimpy can of chicken noodle soup with mushy stuff in it, also becomes a delicacy, preferable to a good home-made soup packed with meat and veggies because your body is just repulsed by protein, fat, fiber, and anything nutritious. The warm salty liquid is also soothing to a sore throat.What's your sick food?

Best remedy for cold / flu is Tom Yung Kung - spicy thai shrimp soup with lime leaves and chili.  Melts the mucus membranes, chases out all  the bad stuff.  Green papaya salad is a close second.Progresso makes the best canned soup.

i'm partial to the campbell's soup and saltines myself, but my dad will have none of it, and will only eat scrambled eggs. he refuses the campbell's because he says he can see the oil swirling on top and it makes him sick(er). seriously though, every time he gets a cough, i have to make him scrambled eggs.

Lipton's Chicken Noodle soup with wheat thins to eat the noodles! Sometimes Saltines but always love crackers. And the gingerale in the tiny green bottles. My great grandmother thought it cured all childhood ailments.

Mighty Leaf Tea
CONTENT
I just tried Mighty Leaf Tea for the first time in Atlantic City and I loved it. The Mountain Spring Jasmine tasted as good as it smelled, very soothing. Their tea bags (tea pouches) cost more than average but that's because they put real tea leaves in their very pretty tea bags, not just the left over dust. They would certainly be impressive to serve to guests and they have nice assorted gift boxes as well.Available at Whole Foods, Garden of Eden, and on-line (free shipping on orders over $75).

Venmar Range Hood
CONTENT
While I'm complaining about my Blue Star Range, I'd like to point out that I like my Venmar Range Hood (model CWC3624). You can choose from three different strengths of ventilation and it's powerful enough to deal with a grill and four burners, all on at the same time. The best part is that the filters snap right out and go in the dishwasher.Knock on wood, no problems yet.

Blue Star Sucks - The Saga Continues
CONTENT
I posted recently about how much my expensive Blue Star sucks so I wanted to update you on the developments. The repair guys just replaced the electronic igniter in the oven which cost me $475. Ridiculous for an oven less than two years old, but I had no choice. I need a working oven right? Let this be a warning though. I spoke to the repair guys and they said high end ovens/ranges like Blue Star, Viking, etc are generally unreliable. He repairs relatively new ones all the time. GE and Kenmore, the regular home lines, last much longer. I had a GE Profile in my last apartment and I never had a problem. Next time, I'm buying the GE again.I can't express how disturbed I am by the fact that Blue Star has to know about their fail rate and continues to sell their ranges at super high premiums and are not doing anything about the construction of their products.

I loved my 50-year old GE double-oven stove/range, so when I remodeled in 1999, I put in a GE Profile oven, which they touted as being able to evenly bake 7 racks of cookies!It didn't.  The oven doesn't heat evenly at all, and the temperature control was more than 75 degrees F off!  Two motherboards later, the temp control is somewhat better, but they told me they can't improve the heat evenness.So I just live with it and don't use it much, figuring it'll get swapped out with the next remodel (and don't even get me started on those cool-looking but horrible-cooking glass cooktops!).Anyway, take heart; even the "cheap" ones are unreliable!

sorry about the blue star, we have one and it works pretty well (the big problem for us is the oven door gets too hot so it sucks for kids).  I will never again get anything other than induction cook tops and electric ovens - they are THE superior technologies (you miss out a bit on broiling w/ the electric, but it's a small price to pay, temperature control is so good).

Alotn Brown got into the topic of the eveness in heating of one's oven on the Souffle episode.  He said to put a pizza stone or a brick on the bottom of the oven.He also said to not open the oven door until 15 minutes after the oven has reached it's preheat temp.  The reason for this, he says, is because the oven thermostat is reading the temperature of the air inside the oven, and once you open the door, poof out goes the hot air (kind of like when I talk).  So, he says if you wait another 15 minutes, then the walls of the oven well absorb the heat as well and your oven can stand you opening and closing the door without losing all of it's heat.

Five Course Tasting Menu
CONTENT
I love ordering tasting menus because you get to try more dishes, so I wonder why I haven't thought of serving guests a tasting menu before. I have done huge family style meals where there was certainly more than five dishes but there's something about presenting it as a tasting menu, that makes it more elegant, and more fun. I hope Edgar and Qing were impressed. Lon loved it.We started with Captain Pat's Maryland Crab Cakes, served with a simple salad (dressing made with Orange Muscat Champagne Vinegar, honey dijon, and olive oil).The second course was Caramelized Onion and Fontina Panini. I made an open-faced version over the weekend and just had to have the flavor combination again.The third course was Jamaican Style Turkey Meatballs, served with mashed potatoes made with butter and heavy cream. Lon loved this pairing and told me so three times.The fourth course was Steelhead Trout on Chinese Broccoli with Oyster Sauce. So simple, yet so good.Edgar and Qing brought us the dessert course. They made this adorable Gingerbread House (or Gazebo) over the weekend.Qing also made an impressive Cheesecake Tiramisu, perfect for me, because it wasn't too sweet.Tasting menus are more work and you'll have to wash a lot more plates, but it's so worth it. What should I make for my next one?

Bachelorette Party Weekend
CONTENT
I have the best bridesmaids in the world. They rented a massive gorgeous house in Brigantine, New Jersey, so that we could have a weekend long celebration. We arrived later than expected on Friday because a mapquest print-out and a GPS couldn't help a car full of girls with no sense of direction.Our plan was to make dinner in the house on Friday night and Brunch on Saturday. The kitchen was huge with two sinks, and pretty well stocked. My only complaint was that the range/oven was really weak. The broiler wasn't able to get any crispy charring on the T-bone steaks and it took a long time just to melt the Fontina on our bread covered in caramelized onions. We also made salmon, sauteed asparagus, tomato and buffalo mozzarella, all easy preparations since we didn't know what the kitchen would be like. We got tons of snacks, guacamole, salsa, red pepper hummus, veggies and Tostitos Scoops, cookies, chocolates, and fruits. After dinner, we played some games that Kasi created. One of the games included drinking white wine every time I got an answer wrong. At least it was a bottle of Mondavi Chardonnay, which I like.Saturday Breakfast/brunch ran from around 8am-12noon, as people trickled in to the kitchen. We made several different types of omelets, roasted fingerling potatoes, scrambled eggs, and had those great Costco croissants. We also celebrated Angela's birthday with Strawberry and Blueberry Tarts. All these pictures (dinner and lunch) are on my friend Sarah's Flickr page. You're in for a treat because she takes way better photos than I do.After eating, we made it out for some outlet shopping. Let's just say we (13 girls) cleaned out BCBG and Coach, and then needed to make a mad dash home to get ready for our dinner reservations at Sonsie. With the exception of a fire drill during dinner, it went smoothly. We headed on to a private members lounge at Showboat that Alex (Tammy's boyfriend) got us access to. We had two bottles of champagne there, and Olivia and Kasi performed their dares. Olivia had to pull out some guy's chest hair and Kasi had to ask a guy to write down how big it is. LOLNext we headed to Mixx at Borgata and partied until about 4am. (I can't show you these pics because my girls will kill me.) We got invited to join a bachelor party and more girls performed their dares. i.e. Winnie asked a guy for sex tips. haha I was certainly drunk by the end and attempted to stay awake long enough to eat at Metropolitan but ended up just riding home with the first group and eating grapes and croissants at the house. The next morning (really only a few hours later), we packed and then headed to Borgata Buffet, finished some more shopping, and then drove home. This time, we didn't get lost.It was an incredible weekend thanks to Monica, Angela, Angie, Kasi, Olivia, Rachel, Sara, Sarah, Sheryl, Tammy, Winnie, and Xiu. Thank You so much! I love you!

Jade Asian Restaurant
CONTENT
I just mentioned recently that Dim Sum on a weekday is a bad idea, but I have to correct myself because some of the places in Flushing are still packed enough on the weekdays to have a good turn over and abundance of variety. Jade Asian Restaurant Jade Asian Restaurant, the latest reincarnation of a very large space, was quite full yesterday at 1:00 PM on a Monday, which gives me hope that this notorious space, will finally have a more permanent name.The space has been redone in a slightly more modern look than the average Chinese banquet space. They even have pink chair covers and servers in uniforms. This means nothing to the Chinese population in Flushing if the food can't speak for itself.My mom and I, tried some of our Dim Sum must-haves like Shrimp Wrapped in Rice Noodle Sheets, Chive Dumplings, Steamed Fish Balls (a little fishier than normal), and Crystal Shrimp Dumplings (a bit salty).Then moved on to some variations of Crystal Shrimp Dumplings. One had Shrimp and Pea Shoots, which I really liked. The other was Shrimp with Crabmeat and Shark Fin (we think fake) on top. It seemed as if the crab meat and shark fin were boiled until all the flavor was removed.We also tried a Chicken and Mushroom Meatball, covered in Sticky Rice. This was unique and we both commented on how aromatic the Chinese Black Mushrooms were.With a few exceptions, most of the dishes were pretty good, especially because everything was served fresh and hot. This is why you have to go to Dim Sum when it's busy. I liked Jade enough to try it again. I'd like to see what they can do on a weekend.

I haven't eaten as much dim sum in Manhattan in the last few years so the only place that comes to mind is Jong Fong on Elzabeth Street. It is really big and usually packed with people, which ensures the high turnover and fresher food. Let me know where you end up going!

Steelhead Trout
CONTENT
I was checking out the salmon at BJ's when I realized that the stack of fish on the left side was Steelhead Trout. It looked very much like salmon fillets (but a bit less fatty) and would have fooled me if I didn't read the label. Of course I wanted to try it.For a first time tasting, I wanted an unadulterated version, just salt and pepper. The texture is very similar to salmon but lighter and sweeter. We both loved it and highly recommend it. I'm sure it would work with any salmon recipe but don't put too much on it. You'll miss it's wonderful natural flavor.

Borgata Buffet
CONTENT
After a night of partying, mostly at Mixx, Borgata Buffet Borgata Buffet seemed like the way to end the weekend. We were mostly in sweats, hoodies, and sneakers, half awake, and dehydrated. I'm a little prejudice against buffets but for about $23 after tax, I was satisfied with what they offered and I give them an extra thumbs up for not charging extra for beverages.They had an omelet station, meat carving station, and the standard trays of eggs, bacon, grits, waffles with toppings, and lots of fried stuff. I didn't try any of that because I just wasn't in the mood. Instead, I went for a random pick of things that may not have fit together. The chocolate muffin was good although the coconut flakes did not add any flavor. I enjoyed the cheese danish and chocolate croissant. The biscuit was quite good, buttery and flaky, and still a bit warm. The cous cous was forgettable but I really like the beet and fennel salad, to my surprise because neither are a favorite of mine. The lox paled in comparison to the large shrimp cocktail that I went back for three times, piling on more each time. The pizza was another surprise because it was good and there's no picture of it because I finished the slice before I reached our table. Same goes for the fried squares of potato that they called home fries but were really bite sized French fries.The dessert display was really quite impressive (more cause they were cute, pretty average in taste) so I tried most of them. The blueberry pie and pecan pie were pretty good. The chocolate peanut tart was so-so.The Sacher Torte was really dense and almost chewy. The cheesecake was standard, and you couldn't really taste the mango in the Mango Mousse Tart.The Coconut Cream Pie had that same problem. Where's the coconut? The Sugar-Free Jello looked awesome but I couldn't try it. (I assume it has food coloring.) The last surprise was that the Sugar-Free Chocolate Layer Cake was the best dessert. It had a nice dark chocolate flavor and it was extremely moist.They also had a gelato station but I was unimpressed with the bit I tried from Olivia and at this point I couldn't fit anything more in. Nothing was super duper but most of it was better than I expected. I'm not solidly for or against this buffet but if you like cocktail shrimp, you'll get your money's worth.

My awesome bridesmaids chose Sonsie Sonsie for Saturday night's dinner for two reasons, Parmesan Truffle Fries and Cashel Blue Cheese Fries. My best friends know that I'm crazy about fries, especially with cheese, and I've been on a serious search for a replacement for my favorite Diner 24 Disco Fries, that are no longer available since the restaurant closed.The Parmesan Truffle Fries (left) were great. The Parmesan helped form a crispy cheese crust on the fries, with just the right hint of truffle. I really enjoyed the tangy flavor of the Cashel Blue Cheese Fries (right) but they did get soggy. Speaking of optimal eating, you do have to eat these fries quickly. If this restaurant was in NYC, I would definitely be back for both of these fries.The rest of the food seemed to be pretty good as well. Angela ordered a nicely cooked Hanger Steak. Monica and Olivia got the Chilean Sea Bass served very hot, in a clay pot (ooh, that rhymes) and I got the largest Diver Sea Scallops I've ever seen. A few girls ordered Pappardelle which seemed to be a bit thick but my over-all impression was that they cooked proteins to the correct temperatures, arranged nice presentations, gave large portions, and used a wide array of ingredients, caper berries, assortment of mushrooms, Sriracha, etc. Most of the flavors were rich and wintery and I enjoyed the flavor combinations that I tasted.If this restaurant was closer to me, I would probably return, especially for the fries, but two hours is a long ride for me. If you're in Atlantic City, stop in.

I just got home from my all-weekend bachelorette party. It was awesome and I am exhausted, so I'm only doing a mini post tonight and I promise I will get the rest posted tomorrow.So, on Friday, I met up with some girls in Astoria to stock up on food from Costco and we had to grab a quick lunch before hitting the road. Dino's Pizza and Pasta Dino's Pizza and Pasta was chosen arbitrarily and Monica and I shared an enormous Chicken Roll. The sauce, cheese, and dough, were all fine, standard pizzeria quality. I also appreciated the very generous amount of cheese oozing out but sadly there was one fatal problem with the Chicken Roll, the chicken. It was so hard to chew that it was less like chicken and more like heavily fried cardboard. We really didn't have any time to waste so I just suffered through but then realized how stupid I was. I should have just pulled out all of the chicken.

Jamaican Turkey Patties
CONTENT
Making efficient use of what's in the fridge has been a hallmark of home cooks forever. That's partially how hand-held pies came to be (you did see Alton's \"A Pie in Every Pocket\" episode, right?). The other day, Jessica used some leftover ground meat from the Goan Chilly Fries to make some Indian-style Beef Patties. This resulted in extra patty dough, that has been sitting in our fridge for a week. Sitting five inches to the right is a box of ground turkey meat leftover from the delicious rosemary meatloaf from Monday night. Being that tomorrow is Sal & Rochelle's son Nick's baptism, and that Rochelle is Jamaican, I guess I was inspired by all these variables.So I started sauteing one medium onion, finely-diced with kosher salt and ground black pepper in one tablespoon of olive oil and one tablespoon of unsalted butter. I was going to follow the recipe Jessica used for her Jamaican Beef Patties, until I decided I could one up it. I kept thinking about how delicious Golden Krust's patties are and some of the others I've had in Brooklyn (such as along Metropolitan Avenue). I added two large cloves of garlic, minced to the saute.When the onions were soft, I added a pound of ground turkey, a teaspoon of curry powder, and a teaspoon of thyme. Then I added a teaspoon of cayenne pepper for kick. While continuously cutting through the mixture with a mixing spoon (to keep the meat from forming), I watched it cook. Afterwards I tasted it and realized it needed a boost, so I tossed in a teaspoon of cumin and a teaspoon of dried cilantro. I was looking for the meat to give my tongue that tickle that one comes to expect from West Indian food and finally it was achieved.So, the recipe modifications were:They came out amazing! Using the turkey in place of beef, made them somewhat lower in fat, but the extra seasoning, kicked up the flavor. Give it a shot.

Organic Profits
CONTENT
Often, it seems that people believe buying organic means escaping the world of corporate food. I'm referring to the large corporate food conglomerates that own major brands. Companies such as Kraft, Pepsi, and Conagra. Some folks even seem to head down the organic road simply to spite the big companies. Personally that's a bit too hippy-ish for my taste. Jessica and I try to eat organic food whenever possible; our goal is to avoid processed foods and chemicals.My concern about the relationship of organic organizations and large food processors is whether or not I trust the large companies to allow the organic to truly be organic. This is especially the case when there is no strict definition around the use of the term.I stumbled upon a particularly interesting diagram by the folks at Good Magazine. It illustrates the relationship between well known organic brands like Boca Foods, Kashi, and Dagoba with their infamous corporate lineage. Yikes, I think some of you are going to be surprised. Check out the diagram here and let us know if this affects your purchasing.

WOW!  Kashi bars are our favorite.  If you read the little advertising blurb on Kashi  boxes, you would thing that they are this little grass roots company.  Thanks for the information.

Sushi Yasuda - 3rd visit
CONTENT
I hope you're not sick of me posting about Sushi Yasuda Sushi Yasuda (first time, second time). I continue to do so because I always learn something from each visit. This time, three lessons Daniel San.First, we were informed that it was the start of soft shell crab season. It lasts for roughly three months so get your butt over to Sushi Yasuda to have the best Flash Fried Soft Shell Crab. It was the largest and meatiest soft-shell, Lon or I, have ever had.Second lesson, I actually really like Uni (sea urchin). I've tried Uni at other places before and never saw the appeal. I never disliked Uni but never saw any reason to pay a premium for it. After this piece of California Uni, I was hooked! It coats your mouth like the savory equivalent of ice cream.Lesson three was a subtle one. As I waited for Lon to arrive, I watched Chef Mitsuru put together a beautiful box of sushi to be delivered. I expressed my surprise that they provided delivery, and Chef Mitsuru told me he would not advise it because the sushi does not taste as good after sitting for several minutes. I wouldn't order it for delivery anyway. I enjoy the tea, service, atmosphere, and seeing Chef Mitsuru too much to fore go all that pleasure. The lesson set in though when I let two pieces of my sushi sit for a while as I chat with Lon and ate other pieces. (The timing was off today completely at our fault. We had to have salad and most of the pieces served all at once because Lon was 30 minutes late to our reservation. Normally, your meal would be paced out.) Those two pieces were still good but did not have the ultra fresh factor that other pieces had.Lessons learned, I now feel like a sushi green belt, making strong progress. See you again next week Mr. Miyagi, oh, I mean Chef Mitsuru.

Blue Star Sucks
CONTENT
My oven is not working, yet again. In less than two years, it has failed twice in major ways, and has a handful of little problems as well. This is super frustrating for me, especially since I was testing a fabulous pie recipe for you.The major issue is that I have a very high end range, a Blue Star 36″ RNB Series with the grill. A few months after it was installed, the broiler was no longer turning on. Under the one year warranty, they did fix it, but it took two visits to fix and that means x amount of days/weeks that I could not use the broiler. Now, it's about 22 months (less than two years) since it was installed, and now the oven is not reaching correct temperature and also not heating evenly. Come on, this is a convection oven! I understand that it is no longer under warranty but I called Blue Star voicing my concerns. I have used several ranges before, all cheaper than this one, that never had a problem. With back splash and tax, I paid over $5000 for this range! I thought I was getting a good product, worthy of the high price. They decided that they would not fix the problem and just gave me the phone number for a repair service. The repair service will be $150 plus any parts. Parts can end up being ultra expensive. Again, there's the added frustration of not having a working oven for almost 2 weeks.Aside from being deprived of major functions, my range annoys me the way a luxury product should not. When the oven is on, the knobs get hot. When some water or sauce spills on the burners, it starts making a terrible clicking noise as it tries to reignite unsuccessfully. You have to then shut off that burner and move to another one.Basically, I'm telling you not to buy a Blue Star. Would you pay more for a BMW if it broke down before a Saturn?

You have my sympathy. It's difficult to make a choice among the high end home ranges like Blue Star, Dacor, Viking, Thermador and such. The biggest problem I had was trying to find any source of unbiased information... The distributors all want to sell something. Anyone who has one in their home either loves it or has some sort of horror story to tell about it. All that's available is anecdotal information.On the other hand, why do people continue to buy Land Rover, Mercedes? Consumer Reports takes the heavy lifting out of your hands by doing ongoing reviews of automobiles. They do appliance reviews as well, but (unfortunately) Blue Star hasn't been on the list of brands they review.

As you know, I am no fan of high end stoves.  When I moved into this apartment it had a Viking which became dubbed (excuse the French) The F**king Viking.  The burners are so large that they cook around the sides of the pans (unless you're making huge batches and cooking in professional size cookware) instead of under them - and it's impossible to simmer.  The burners are so large they do not maintain a low enough heat to simmer.  Of course, I can't use a professional or high end stove because I must use the same type of stove as my readers (I write cookbooks).  My other gripe about even medium price stoves is that they all have sealed burners.  Although that does prevent stuff from fall under the burner, you need to have a gap in the ring of the flame so air can get to the fire (I'm talking about gas ranges, of course) so therefore the flame does not go in a complete circle and leaves some spots less hot than others.  My next stove is going to have to be low end (which doesn't matter as I have yet to use the convection  or the self-cleaning features of my Frigidaire stove)and I'm going for a Magic Chef the only open burner brand I know of.Carol Gelles

Hi oldest grandchild,It is tough to find unbiased information but I did ask the repair guys today and they seem to be a fairly reliable source. They repair high ends way more often than regular  ovens and they said every house they go to bitches the way I do about how expensive it is to be breaking constantly.

2008-03-19 12:12:00
You had better luck than I did... When I asked around, all I could find was recommendations from the two stores in town that carried (and installed, and serviced) the high end brands.I ended up with a Jenn-air 6-burner downdraft cooktop and a separate Whirlpool convection oven. They're both at the high-ish end of the scale for consumer kitchen gear, but nowhere near the cost of Blue Star, Dacor, etc.In eight years, I've had the oven serviced once. No other issues.Don't go by my experience, though. Check with Consumer Reports. They run regular reports on the full spectrum of consumer ranges, ovens, cooktops, etc. as well as some of the high-end non-commercial brands.BTW, I really enjoy your blog!

When I was looking for a range, my first choice was a Wolfe. But the sales guy actually talked me out of it because he said too many customers were having issues with the Wolfe. So I ended up getting a Viking. Within my first year, the oven started making weird noises whenever it was on convention bake. It was fixed under the warranty, but yes, it is disappointing because it's supposed to be a quality product. I'm now at my two year anniversary with my Viking and so far, nothing else has happened (yet?). So I'm neutral on the Viking range. The Viking hood with recirculating kit doesn't work well at all. I had to buy an fan and turn it on to circulate the air, even for regular cooking.

Oxtail and Linguine
CONTENT
We had Martin and Melissa over for dinner last night and they loved my Oxtail and Linguini. Good thing I wrote down the recipe for my Oxtail Sauce. Four people almost finished the entire pot! I served it with linguine but it would be wonderful with pappardelle or fettuccine as well.Oxtail Sauce1. Heat oil in a large pot. Saute onions and carrots until partially softened.2. Add crushed tomato, diced tomato, and tomato sauce and stir.3. Add beef oxtails and bring to a boil.4. Reduce to a simmer. Add garlic, crushed red pepper, bay leaves, and pepper. No salt is needed.5. Cook for 4 hours, uncovered. Stir occasionally and watch to see if you need to add water. ( I added about 6-8 cups of water during the 4 hours.)6. Remove bay leaves before serving.In case you wanted to know about the rest of the meal...We started with a Tuna Pesto Croquette with a Mustard Sauce. The flavor and texture was good but most of the coating fell off while frying.The Oxtail and Linguine was served with Broccoli Rabe sauteed with garlic and olive oil. Simple and great pairing with a rich meaty pasta.We ended with little cups of Banana Pudding, which was partially decided on because my oven is not working properly (which I'll get into on a later post). Otherwise, I think Tiramisu or Canolis would have been more in line with our theme tonight.

Egg Custard King Cafe
CONTENT
After our not quite finished lunch, we went to Egg Custard King Cafe Egg Custard King Cafe to get some filler for our tummies. I've never patronized before because the sign looked so commercialized and the beauty of Chinatown is all the unpolished shops. Well not to worry, there was no franchise training here. None of the counter girls spoke English and they could barely describe their products to me in Chinese. Ahh...right at home.Since they call themselves the Egg Custard King Cafe, it would make sense for them to over do it on egg custard. They have honeydew flavored, almond flavored, strawberry flavored, and banana flavored, none of which I tried because it likely has food coloring. (I'm allergic.)I did try their Classic Egg Custard, a Creme Brulee version, and an All Egg White Custard. They were all very good, smooth custards with flaky crusts. My favorite is still the classic but the egg white is a surprisingly good option. The Creme Brulee was my least favorite because it was the most sweet but these are great little desserts for $0.80 each. Lon also bought a hot dog bun which he thought was great.As much as I wanted to dislike this place, I'm sure I'll be back. Hopefully, not too soon.

Fu Zhou Restaurant
CONTENT
We really needed a quick lunch so we just walked into Fu Zhou Restaurant Fu Zhou Restaurant, near the Grand Street train station. This will be a short post because we only got three dishes because weekdays are just not the best time to have dim sum. (I want to slap myself cause I knew that already.) So everything was good with a \"but\" ... The Beef Short Rib had a nice peppery flavor but it was too oily. The Shrimp in Rice Noodle Wrap was made with such fresh rice noodle, with that incredible chewiness, but the shrimp was kind of fishy. The Crystal Shrimp Dumplings had plump shrimp but the wrapper was too soft, not bouncy as it should be. We're not complaining though. It was $4.50 for the two of us and we were almost done with lunch. We'd be willing to go back and try them on a weekend, peak dim sum time.

Choice Eats
CONTENT
Choice Eats, a tasting event held by The Village Voice, is an inexpensive ($25 for pre-bought tickets) way to try food from several different restaurants. However, Lon and I don't feel that it is an accurate way of judging a restaurant because serving food without a kitchen is a very different skill. Some restaurants have more experience working events like these and some restaurants were noticeably unprepared. Keep in mind that our evaluation of the food is based solely on what we experienced last night and does not necessarily reflect the restaurant.We did not try every booth because there were way too many Carribean food booths and too many Indian rice dishes. We also skipped Hummus Place (mulit-local), Petite Abeille (multi-local), Kampuchea Kampuchea, Vanessa's Dumplings Vanessa's Dumplings, and The Sunburnt Cow The Sunburnt Cow, because we've already eaten their food.So, let's go through the dishes from worst to best because that's how I used to eat as a kid. (Did you save your favorite candy flavors for last?) Krik Krak Krik Krak served Deep Fried Pork that had cooled and turned into a rock. I literally could not bite through it and I crack crab shells with my teeth. Their other dish of Mixed Vegetables on top of polenta-like cubes was cold and bland. Tiffin Wallah Tiffin Wallah served a rice pancake with toppings. I couldn't tell what all the mix of sauces were on top but I really thought it was gross. Queen of Sheba Ethiopian Queen of Sheba Ethiopian served two wrap-like dishes and both of us could not eat it. The sour and spongy Ethiopian bread must be an acquired taste.(I have tried Ethiopian food before and did not like it previously either.)The next category means it wasn't gross but still disappointing. Sadly, this is a long list. Maremma Maremma served a Porchetta with Mixed Beans. The beans were a bit under-cooked and the flavors did not go together. Fette Sau Fette Sau had this wonderfully tender pastrami that tasted like nothing. Someone forgot to season it at all. Chiyono Chiyono served a cold seaweed croquette that only tasted like potato. Their lotus root and red bean dessert was marginally better. I enjoyed the Stewed Chicken from Culpepper's Culpepper's but not much else out of their 7 or more offerings. Foods that shouldn't be eaten cold was the main problem here. Lastly, Nirvana Cafe & Bar Nirvana Cafe & Bar gave out very salty Cod Fish Balls.A bunch of samples fell under pretty good. Kuma Inn Kuma Inn makes a decent vegetarian noodle dish. Xunta Tapas Bar Xunta Tapas Bar served warm Tuna Croquette and Chorizo. Schnitzel Haus served their Goulash hot and Lon liked the sandwich from Cantina Cantina. (I did not.)We have two winners for presentation. Pacificana Pacificana jazzed up Chinese take-out food by chopping up General Tso's Chicken and serving it with cucumber and scallion on a circular fried wonton skin. Deshi Biryani Deshi Biryani cleverly places lentils in a hollow puff , and a tangy and spicy sauce is spooned on, all assembled right before you eat it so that the shell remains crispy. The presentation winners also win for easiest to eat, no fork needed, important for this kind of event.The two runner ups were Mercadito's Mercadito Shrimp Taco and Jimmy's No. 43's Jimmy's No. 43 Toasted Walnuts with local honey, fennel dust, and sea salt. Both were simple, distinct, and really nicely balanced in flavor.Ok, the moment you've been waiting for....The winner of the night was Fatty Crab Fatty Crab. They served a wonderfully fragrant Coconut Rice without overdoing the coconut, which matched perfectly with very tender Beef Short Rib. The whole plate was served hot and tasted fresh, like it was just made. No one else achieved this illusion. Nice touch, with the toasted coconut flakes on top.We really didn't try anything amazing at the event, but for $25, it's enjoyable enough. Be prepared for some waiting on lines but most of it moves at a reasonable rate. There's plenty of alcohol for those who just now peaked interest. I'm telling you all this because I'm pretty sure they will repeat the event next year. By your tickets in advance!

I was amused to see the pic of 'deshi biriyani'. Biriyani is a rice pilaf with meat in it...the way of cooking depends on the region of India. there are 2 core types : Lucknowi from North India and Hyderabadi from South India. The puff used in the photo is a base for a very typical street food in India. It is called phuchka in Calcutta where it is stuffed with potatoes. It is called paani poori in Mumbai where it is stuffed with tiny gram flour balls and gol gappa in the Delhi. Apart from the soild filling it has tamarind juice in it too. Sour in Cal but sweet and sour in Mumbai and Delhi. The filling in the festival you attended is called channa masala in the North of India and ghoogni In Calcutta. You normally have it with Indian breads like naan or roti.

Royale
CONTENT
In a Newsweek article that my friend Sara gave me, I read that, \"Many Japanese cite 'tabearuki', or roaming around looking for great places to dine, as a favorite hobby.\" Now that I know the Japanese have a word for it, I feel completely justified for spending a good portion of my time window shopping for food. Other girls may goggle over Jimmy Choo's and Minolo's ( I don't even know if I got that right.); I drool at the windows of bakeries, pizza shops, and the butcher's.Ice, my Jack Russell Terrier, had a veterinary visit today which gave me the perfect opportunity to practice my tabearuki skills. (Can you imagine a reality show based on a tabearuki competition?) On the way there, I spotted Royale on the corner of 6th Avenue and 12th Street, in that ever changing spot attached to Sammy's Noodle Shop Sammy's Noodle Shop. I made a mental note to pop in on my way back and of course I did. As always, I got a coffee, which was mega weak, but I sampled a great piece of chocolate chip cookie. A bit later, they offered me a little coffee cookie to try. Normally, I would've bought a few pastries to take home and share with Lon but we have the Choice Eats event tonight. But I have decided that I will go back and try more goods for two reasons. The two cookies I tried were not too sweet, a rare find in American sweets. The guys were friendly and knowledgeable about their products. Apparently, the owner also has stake in Baked Baked, in Redhook, and that's where the goodies come from.I hope Royale does well in this notorious spot. Stay tuned for my next visit.

Optimal Eating
CONTENT
I often eat too fast in effort to eat certain foods at their peak of optimal pleasure. I scarf down pizza and grilled cheese sandwiches before the cheese starts to solidify. I take large spoonfuls of ice cream (often causing brain freeze) because I don't like it too melted. I chug coffee and hot chocolate while it's piping hot and I inhale French fries before they loose their crispiness. This concerns me because I can't take the time to savor each bite and enjoy the company of others. Eating too fast also leads to eating too much and leaving dinner in a half-comatose state with a belly ache.Optimal eating can also lead to eating too much just because most things just taste better when they're fresh. I'll eat a whole loaf of bread when it comes out of the oven, because it won't taste as good tomorrow. The same goes for dough nuts, croissants, and pastries. I eat too much when it comes to food that I don't want to reheat to eat again, like fish, seafood, and red meat.No, I don't have a solution for all of this but my friend Angie did send me a link to a company who has a solution for soggy cereal. Eat Me Crunchy has a bowl that keeps most of the cereal separate from the milk so that only a portion of the cereal mixes with milk. It costs about $15 to get it to the US so it's not bad.

What a great idea, but i'm not sure about the execution? So the milk is at the bottom, but you still have cereal to dig through at the top?  Isn't it better to just put all the milk in the bowl, pour in a little cereal, eat, pour in more cereal?

Dinner in the Sky
CONTENT
Would you enjoy eating 40 to 50 meters into the air? You may be able to soon at Dinner in the Sky. The seats swivel 180 degrees and I hope you are strapped in tightly. They started in Belgium but are making their way around. The ride/restaurant is available for rental and seats 22 guests. You will never find my mother at Dinner in the Sky, but I'd like to test it out and see if the altitude effects the taste of the food.

Someone sent me this link a couple of weeks ago. I'd love to be able to try it! But the chances are very little of anyone bringing it here to the Philippines, and even if someone did, I'm sure the price will be higher than that platform.

Hi thereI just came accross your blog thanks to stumbleupon and I am loving the food pics that you have, they are all so bright and full of colour. I started off as a blogger myself a year ago and loved talking to other food bloggers around the world so much that I wanted to find a way of more people sharing photos and meeting other foodies. I used to get annoyed that I would be making so many great recipe videos and food photos and hardly anybody would see them! That is when I came up with http://www.ifoods.tv which is a new site for foodies all around the world to share food photos, recipes and videos as well as meeting other foodies. We are only starting off and are currently a small community but I would love to see you there sharing some of your amazing photos with other foodies! Keep up the good work on the blog and hope to talk soon.Cheers!

Rosemary Meatloaf

I decided to serve my Chinese family an all-American meal, Rosemary Meatloaf, Buttermilk Mashed Potatoes, and Sauteed Garlic Spinach. I have to pat myself on the back for this meatloaf recipe. It was so unbelievably flavorful and moist, my brother couldn't believe it was mostly turkey.Rosemary Meatloaf1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees.2. Combine turkey, beef, egg, onion, 1/2 cup tomato sauce, bread crumbs, rosemary, salt and pepper.3. Press into a 9 X 5 loaf pan (sprayed with Pam). Make an indent along the center, like the shape of a perfect pound cake. Set aside.4. Stir together 3/4 cup tomato sauce, vinegar, mustard, and brown sugar. Pour onto the meatloaf.5. Bake for 55 minutes. Let it sit for 5 minutes before serving.

Lego Fun Snacks? Not so fun...
CONTENT
During our last visit to BJs, Jessica and I noticed a big ole box that said \"Lego Fun Snacks\". Stephen, my brother-in-law, not only enjoys difficult to eat food, but also Legos. We had to buy it, even though it seemed odd that Kellogg's was producing candy and even though no human should consume this much candy.While Jessica couldn't eat this, because of it's food coloring, she and I were both equally excited to see just how honestly the Lego form factors were reproduced. How many different block sizes were included? Were they easy to put together and take apart? I wonder if assembling pieces into fun Lego sculptures and then eating them would taste different?First, let's have a look at the candies:Ooo.. so sad looking. First, they're all the same dimensions: 2×2 \"blocks\". Unfortunately, barely three are square. Second, while you can't tell from the picture, the bottoms are solid, not even a minor indent. So there's no chance of assembling these \"Legos\", except perhaps to just mash 'em together like warm gummy bears, a la the girl from the end of \"Ferris Bueller's Day Off\" (watch the scene here).You can't assemble them; they're barely square; they're way not in the normal colors of legos; and they're only in one form factor. Stephen and I did agree they were tasty though. At the minimum I can say these really shouldn't be branded Lego by any stretch of the imagination; and at the maximum, I'd say skip these.

Indian-style Beef Patties
CONTENT
I was trying to figure out what to do with the left-over meat mixture from the Goan Chilly Fries I made yesterday. I decided to fill it into a dough from a Jamaican Beef Patty recipe, and have an Indian-style alternative. It was pretty good. Lon said he likes the regular Jamaican Beef Patties more but still managed to eat three of these.

sounds interesting. In fact East Indians (who are residents of the West coast of India and are culturally similar to Goans) make very nice patties where they have a mince beef base, enveloped in a mashed, potato shell, coated in bread crumbs and deep fried. Yummy, though toxic

they do taste awesome...you can add a bit of chopped green chillies, cilantro/ coriander and of course salt to season the mashed potato. We used to get them at our local butchery, Marks, and my wife and I used to refer to them as beef bombs. Will require a lot of oil though. Stuffing remains the same as what you used for your dumplings. Let me know how it went.

'wichcraft: The Magic is Gone
CONTENT
When craft opened the menu immediately appealed to me. Being shi-shi, the restaurant was booked-up, and I found it hard to go without reservations weeks ahead. Frankly, I wasn't that interested. So, I never made it to craft. My sister says it's pretty good, albeit pricey. Jessica made it to craftbar and said it was good, but pricey. Tom Colicchio continued opening tons of restaurants with craft in the name, including 12 sandwich shops called 'wichcraft (ten of which are in New York, one in San Francisco, and one in Las Vegas).My first visit to a 'wichcraft 'wichcraft LV was the Las Vegas location, in the MGM Grand. My sister, brother-in-law, and I all thoroughly enjoyed our sandwiches, and absolutely loved the scone we had. When I got back to NYC, I had to go again. So a few co-workers and I ordered in from the 8th Street location 'wichcraft 8th St.. My New York 'wich was just as delicious as my Las Vegas 'wich. It was also just as expensive, running about $10. In a city filled with delis and other sandwich shops, does that make sense? Well for such a wonderful sandwich, maybe...That was in the Fall of '07, no more than 5 months ago. Well whatever magic spell kept me going back to 'wichcraft and forking over so much moola seems to have run out. Sorry Tom Potter. This visit to the 20th Street location 'wichcraft 20th St. was quite a let down. My two friends and I all agreed: it's simply not worth the ridiculous wait (over 10 minutes for a basic sandwich, a problem that I complained about when I went previously) and not worth the cash (still about $10 for any sandwich, with tax). And apparently someone has used a shrinking potion, because the sandwiches are about 30% smaller than they used to be.After eating the meatloaf with cheddar, bacon, and tomato relish on ciabatta ($9.50+tax), I was still hungry. It was about the size of a breakfast sandwich from a fast food joint. In comparison, one could easily pick up a meatball parm. hero from their favorite pizza shop for $6.50 and be absolutely stuffed.I won't be going back to 'wichcraft.

you could get a meatball hero but I bet if you asked anyone behind the counter of your local deli where the meat comes from, they won't be able to tell you. 'wichcraft knows, and are proud (they should be!) that all their food comes from safe places, all natural etc etc. i think having good clean food that is consistently produced is well worth the extra buck over your deli sandwich on bland bread.

Actually I just went the 'wichcraft on park/47 2 weeks ago and still enjoyed my sandwich. There was no wait at 12:45 and I ordered a make your own sandwich of gruyere, carmelized onions, pear on cranberry pecan bread.  It was delicious and since it was vegetarian it was a 'bargain' at $5.50 + tax.  My splurge of a black cherry boylan's was $2.And, it's funny as I was walking during lunch today I saw a 'wichcraft delivery person near my bldg and thought dang, I'm sure that'll be better than my lunch

Goan Chilly Fries
CONTENT
I love French fries and our friend at Finely Chopped, was kind enough to write me a recipe for Goan Chilly Fries. He gave me some choices so here's exactly how I made it.1. Heat a wok with just enough oil to coat it.2. Saute the onion until softened just a little. Add the tomatoes.3. Add the ground beef, chili powder, garam masala, black pepper, and salt. Saute until most of the pink meat has turned brown.3. Add the vinegar and let it cook on medium-high heat until most of the liquid has evaporated.4. Add the ketchup, bell peppers, and jalapeno, cooking for 1 more minute.5. Serve on top of freshly made French fries and garnish with cilantro.A little sweet, a bit acidic, a little spicy, and so aromatic. So many playful flavors danced in my mouth. I loved it. You do have to eat it quickly though, before the fries get soggy, but the topping would be great on rice or a flatbread as well. Thanks for the great recipe!

Resto Leon
CONTENT
Resto Leon Resto Leon looks like the standard French Bistro in New York, mostly wood, a bit of dark red, and some mirrors. It's dimly lit by candles set on tables packed closely together and the bench (against the wall) I was sitting on grew distractingly uncomfortable by the end of the meal. All this is forgivable if the food is good and when I dine at a bistro, I don't expect anything inventive, just simple stuff done right.On that note, my favorite for the night was an appetizer of Pan Roasted Cape Cod Squid. The simple preparation of garlic, olive oil, lemon, and parsley is a perfect one for tender morsels of squid.The Escargot was pretty good but the left-over puddles of hot garlicky oil, full of herbs, made an even better dipping sauce for mediocre bread.Our entrees arrived and before the waitress could set my plate on the table, I was grabbing for the fresh-out-of-the-fryer fries. They were hand cut, not as thin as the McDonald's fries, so I was amazed at how crispy they were, and how crispy they remained. I will no longer be prejudiced against fries over a 1/4 inch thick.My smile was soon wiped from my face as I cut in to the medium-well steak that I had ordered medium-rare. It was not a true Steak Au Poivre either, just steak with crushed black peppercorns. Winnie's steak was also served medium-well, having ordered medium-rare.They got Angie's Magret De Canard (duck) right, but the highlight of her dish was really the potato gratin, a block of maybe 10-15 layers of very thinly sliced potato, with cream and cheese between each. We all stuck our forks on to Angie's plate repeatedly.Xiu ordered the Salmon A LA Leon which was pretty fancy looking for a bistro. The salmon was cooked correctly but the polenta was bland.A few of us ordered lattes, that tasted burnt, and shared the Tart Tatin. The chunks of apple were large, making the small amount of pastry even less noticeable. It seemed pre-made, missing caramelization and the contrast of warm pastry to cold ice cream.Like many places, Resto Leon made some things well, and some things not so well. My overall experience was not good enough for a return visit but it wasn't bad enough for me to dissuade you from going. Just don't order steak.

How to be a Food Writer
CONTENT
I just took this mini course at The Institute of Culinary Education -- How to be a Food Writer, taught by Marge Perry. The 5 hour course, broken in two days, is not enough to get you there, but it is a good start.Marge Perry runs an exciting and interactive class. She has an amazing sense of humor and tons of experience to offer. It's easy to get lost in conversation with all these other food lovers, but she keeps the pace going in the interest of her class leaving with as much information as possible. The course covers two major parts, the food writing, and pitching (to get yourself published).I learned a lot, enjoyed myself immensely, and really wanted more. Luckily, she is teaching an 8 week course at Media Bistro.

Savory Oatmeal
CONTENT
I came up with my perfect breakfast about 5 years ago because I needed a healthy, athlete's breakfast (good carbohydrate and protein). It's oatmeal with an egg over-easy (made in a non-stick pan with Pam so I don't add fat) on top, generously seasoned with salt and pepper. This may seem odd to you since most people have oatmeal with honey, cinnamon apples, or something sweet. But consider it a new take on the Chinese breakfast, congee, which is a savory rice porridge. If I call it fusion food, will you eat it?I love runny egg yolk. It is nature's ready made sauce that coats anything it touches. It's rich and fatty yet having just one egg controls the amount. Oatmeal has that wonderful chewy starchiness while being high in fiber. This savory oatmeal breakfast became a staple for me when I noticed that it kept me full longer, which makes sense since oatmeal and eggs are both in the top 10 of the \"satiety index\".

Sushi Yasuda - 2nd Visit
CONTENT
\" I love the fishes cause they're so delicious.\" - Pepperidge Farm GoldfishThe thought of Sushi Yasuda just makes me giddy. As promised, I am now a regular. Chef Mitsuru remembers me. I enter with high expectations and leave satisfied, with a childish skip to my step. Eating at Sushi Yasuda is an adventure. If you leave some or all of your meal up to your chef, you will try seafood that you've never had before.On this visit, I had some of the same fresh and expertly cut fish as last time, Blue Fin Tuna that looks like vibrant red rose petals, Spanish Mackerel that melts in your mouth, oyster with a slippery and sensual texture, reminding you that it's a known aphrodisiac. Every piece is enhanced by the sweet and creamy wasabi, with such a subtle bite that it could be eaten alone in small amounts.The progression of excitement grows for me as I start with my familiar fish and move on to new ones. The Cherry Stone Clam had a smooth and clean feel, just a little resistance to the bite, creating a tender snap. It was beautifully scored and looked like a melon colored violin. Chef Mitsuru reminds me that it should be eaten as is because he has already put the perfect amount of wasabi and soy sauce on it.Next, came Tazmanian Trout and White King Salmon Rolls. They were rich and fatty, complimenting the lightness of rice and seaweed, as I rolled it about my mouth. The Tazmanian trout felt like room temperature butter as I used the roof of my mouth to press it against my tongue.I like to end my meal with a bang, 3 pieces of the chef's choice. Each one feels like a gift. Chef Mitsuru presents me with the muscle of a Fluke fin. It was like getting chicken oyster when you had only tried white meat chicken before. The flavor of the muscle is reminiscent of Fluke but seems concentrated, and the texture has a nice chewiness.I watched as the chef squeezed fresh lemon juice and carefully placed a little sea salt on the partially cooked Giant Clam. The initial moment of taste brought me to a barbeque and then immediately took me to the sea. I wanted the flavors to linger longer as I marveled at the way it tasted like a clam coated by a bit of fire roasted swordfish.Kibinago is like a milder flavored sardine, with tighter and firmer flesh. The metallic silver skin and peachy flesh form a unique looking striped sushi.When I'm done, I am truly satisfied, but not overly full. The meal is an education and so it naturally paces you as you pause to interact with your chef. I leave meals here feeling like I have just spent time with a friend as Chef Mitsuru says, \"See you next week.\"

The Adore
CONTENT
I love having coffee and something sweet in the afternoon so I set out to find something new today when I realized that I've never tried the tiny little place one street below my apartment, The Adore The Adore. I had assumed the place was French but all the employees were Japanese and served in that happy smiley way that seemed impenetrable.By mid-afternoon, there wasn't much left. A sign on their window said the sandwiches were sold out, which gave me high hopes for the coffee and Orange Tuile I chose. As soon as I walked out with my bag, I took a sip of the coffee. It was pretty weak coffee and only slightly above lukewarm but sugar and cream go a long way so I did drink a little more than half of it. As I took a bite into the beautiful cookie, my teeth sank slowly in, not at all what I expected. The orange stuff had moistened the sliced almonds and the tuile, changing it from airy. light, and crisp, what a tuile should be, to a slightly chewy, denser confection. Only the very ends snapped a little bit. The flavors of almond, orange, and vanilla were noticeable (but the chocolate wasn't) in the mildly sweet cookie that was still enjoyed at $1 per piece, but not something I'll remember by next week.

Orange Muscat Champagne Vinegar
CONTENT
I recently bought a bottle of Orange Muscat Champagne Vinegar from Trader Joe's. Like their other vinegars I've tried before, it's good stuff. I realized today that I haven't made a salad with it yet. Here's the simple recipe for my first dressing with this vinegar:1/2 cup Trader Joe's Orange Muscat Champagne Vinegar1 tablespoon whole grain dijon mustard1 clove garlic. minced1/4 cup olive oil1 teaspoon sesame oil1 teaspoon roasted sesame seedssalt and pepper to tasteJust mix all the ingredients together and it's done! If you're not using immediately, it's better to keep the sesame seeds separate until serving.

It's a versatile dressing that could go on most salads. We had it on a simple salad of baby greens, seedless  cucumber, carrots, and apples yesterday, but I think it would go great on some greens with shredded chicken or even duck.

Just made it. It was absolutely delicious. Only critique is that it came out a bit thinner than I would have liked for a salad dressing. I think more olive oil would have helped thicken it up.

Cafe Brama
CONTENT
All this talk about coffee made me crave a good cup of cappuccino. After lunch yesterday, I took my cousin Christina to Cafe Brama Cafe Brama so I could satisfy my craving. They serve my favorite cappuccino with pride. I remember the first time I went to Cafe Brama. I was debating whether I wanted a cappuccino because I was frustrated after paying for a string of cappuccinos that I did not enjoy, just that week. When the owner (one of two brothers) came over to take our order, Lon told him I was picky. A smile came over his face and he asked me to try the cappuccino and if I didn't like it, he would not charge me. Well, obviously I loved it.On this visit, my cousin Christina was interested in their Mikado Crepe. It's a crepe with vanilla ice cream and warm Belgian chocolate sauce. It's not like the crepes made on the streets of Paris, but it's still really good and I really don't know of any other good crepe places in NY (that are still open). As expected, they used good ingredients, very noticeable in the chocolate.I'm glad to see that business has picked up since my first visit when they first opened. It was not a meal time. yet there was a scattering of people on their laptops (lots of Mac users here). In any case, please go have their cappuccino!

For some reason while reading your blog, I started picturing us on our trip to celebrate the end of our 20s. I see us sitting along the Alfami Coast somewhere, sipping an unbelievable cup of cappuccino, chatting and laughing, and enjoying the beautiful view in front of us. Perhaps even a slice of homemade tiramisu is also in reach. I can't wait to start planning our trip. We're going to have such an awesome time.

There's a great crepe place (if it's still open) way down at the end of St. Marks, between 1st and Ave A. Here's the menupages site for it. The crepes are very thin, and they do savoury as well as sweet. From what I remember, they definitely compare to the ones in Parisian street cafes.

David Rio Chai
CONTENT
I am certainly not a chai expert. Actually, I thought I just hated chai for a long time and stopped sampling them. About 5 years ago, I tried David Rio Chai at one of the Javitz Center food shows and it is still the only chai I like now. (I don't go looking for chai the way I do coffee though.) I have tried multiple flavors but my favorite is still the Tiger Spice Chai.If you don't trust my amateur level in chai, Shruti and Ekta, 2 Indian friends who are avid chai drinkers, have put their thumbs up as well.

I opened the Elephant Vanilla Chai (David Rio) here at Lon's work as soon as the hot water hit the powder people started saying "What smells so good?" 3 or 4 of us had a cup and my take is that it is a good comfort drink - nice and sugary and a mild vanilla flavor.  This is a good demi-dessert drink. - Marcos

No More Shooting the Moon
CONTENT
This morning Shruti and I were discussing how Shooting the Moon (a strategy in the card game Hearts) can be applied to various situations. For those of you not in the know, shooting the moon is when you do so badly in Hearts (by taking every penalty in a round) that you actually do better. That is, if you take ALL the penalties, rather than take the penalty points you have all the penalty points subtracted, which helps. Well, later in the day I had lunch with a friend at The 2nd Ave Deli The 2nd Ave Deli, and it occurred to me that many kosher and kosher-style delis try to shoot the moon with their service; I'll explain...The kosher/kosher-style delis try to represent a traditional New York deli experience, which they think requires providing obnoxious service, and perhaps it does. Some restaurants purposefully have obnoxious service, however, that doesn't mean the service is bad, you just need to play along. For instance, Tim told me about The Elbow Room in Downtown Vancouver The Elbow Room, they actually say on their website \"Food and Service is our Name. ABUSE is our game (so have some fun!)\" They do things there like ignore customers until the customer freaks out. In other words, The Elbow Room, is shooting the moon with their service. It's so bad, it's notably good!On the other side of the coin is when we went to Sarge's. The service is there is horrible; but it's not on purpose. I believe they purposefully don't care, because they're trying to give you some type of experience, but the result is just dreck.I had dined at 2nd Ave Deli many time when it was on 2nd Ave & 10th Street. The food was consistently good, albeit insanely over-priced; resulting in a mediocre value. Equally mediocre at 2nd Ave Deli was the service. I remember one time Jessica and I stopped in two years ago (or so) and we had to ask three times for water.All that seems to have changed at the new location. It's still as small and crowded as the old location, even though the space is more long and narrow than square, as it used to be. However right from the beginning the experience was better. While waiting, two maitre d's checked on us, even clearing space for us to sit while waiting, the first told us it would be 10-15 minutes. No more than five minutes later, we got a table.We sat down and within seconds had our pickles and cole slaw, nothing new there. No bread though, which I recall always getting when at the old location. But something new this time, when we got our menus we also got a dish with something brown in it -- my eyes lit up -- it was griven and shmaltz-sauteed onions! Yum. We gobbled up the Jewish Amuse Bouche. Humorously, I had just made griven for the first time in about a year a few days ago. My friend had the classic pastrami on rye; I had the combo pastrami and corned beef on rye. When I asked for it hot our great waiter said \"of course.\" The right answer.After we finished, our waiter gave us each a complimentary shot of egg cream; we clanged the shot glasses in enjoyment of the perfect end to the meal. As another sign of perfecting their customer service, when our waiter returned my friend's credit card, he thanked him by name. All class.So the new 2nd Ave Deli found a new formula: the food and decor of old school New York deli, but rather than trying to be so bad their good; they're just great. And at $21pp, including tax + tip; we were both stuffed and really happy. The value is all there. I recommend you go!

Rhong Tiam
CONTENT
I read a couple of reviews claiming that Rhong Tiam Rhong Tiam was authentic Thai food. I was so excited. Could it be? Authentic Thai in Manhattan? No, I was mislead. My cousin Christina is home for spring break and I took her there for lunch and now feel bad for not taking her somewhere more memorable.They have Green Curry, Red Curry, Panang Curry.....same as all the other Thai places. All dishes have a choice of chicken, tofu, beef, or shrimp, another menu trait common in Manhattan Thai places. I chose the Woon Sen Pad Thai (made with bean thread noodle) and Christina had the regular Pad Thai. The meal starts with a decent vegetable soup, very peppery in a good way. They served our lunch in a bento box (what the?), with crappy fried dumplings and spring roll, mayonnaise drenched salad, and rice. While my noodles tasted ok, they were definitely not authentic. They were more sweet and not spicy. Further, everything else in the box was junk.I am insulted that some people tried to compare this place to Sripraphai. I was totally let down by the meal. I do see that their dinner menu is a little different and a bit more expansive than the standard Thai place, but I would find it hard to believe that this place could pull off a Sripraphai level meal at night.

I had some great curries at Cabbages and Condoms and Soi 5 at Bongkok as well at a lady with a cart at Sukhumvit. Also had some good curry at a fairly posh restaurant curry at KL. Malaysian curries are quite nice too. Thai curries are growing poular at India too. Some restaurants make it well while others make it a bit too lumpy. I've made them with ready made curry pastes.

Seoul Garden
CONTENT
I have mentioned Seoul Garden Seoul Garden before but that was before we had pictures so I thought I'd give you another run through, since I had lunch there yesterday. Since my last visit, they have replaced their tabletops and printed new menus. It's nice to see that the content has remained the same and the prices too. I believe they have the best prices in K-town, possibly because they are a second floor restaurant and rent is lower.Usually, their panchan is pretty good but yesterday, I felt like it was a bit skimpy and below normal quality. I usually go for dinner so perhaps lunch is not the way to go. Kimchee is a standard part of panchan and it was good. The bean sprouts, another commonly served panchan, was average. The celery was nothing interesting. I always love the dried and fried tiny fishes but I was so disappointed that the garlic stems that I usually enjoy, were so over-salted. Panchan is really fun because I feel like every time I go to a Korean restaurant, there's always at least one dish, I have never seen or tasted before. This time it was some jello-like stuff that was marinated and tossed with some marinated romaine. Unfortunately, it wasn't very good but I still like the surprise.The reason I go to Seoul Garden though, is for their Soon Dubu. They are known for this traditional Korean tofu stew, bubbling hot (see video below), so you can drop a raw egg in. I always order the Combination Soon Dubu which has tofu, squid, mussels, shrimp, beef, and sometimes clam, and the optional egg. You can order it at non-spicy, mild, spicy, or very spicy. Spicy is perfect for me and the rich flavor is always wonderful.http://www.blogger.com/img/videoplayer.swf?videoUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fvp.video.google.com%2Fvideodownload%3Fversion%3D0%26secureurl%3DqAAAAPCZD0ddCGBZjZs6HcCGJYd7vXiUh54S-mTAWktsouV5hBqhl7B2V9igYNFLjvCdT4JRdV_VqIcqfdH5R9_Q9ZEpt-loAm0TlPApngzD1NzggrT3ojDgs0xxqoGLRmik9KFbebko67Pr48ikzqpT8UlDbfjn4NryDdnOb-mtzF0fpX7M27vDmUqQsTZqY9eEMwFxWPQ8Sc6eX6-lQkCCIzDE3sdPhvVwJx82LdA053pp%26sigh%3DMP8psXARffWmzQ3K4worWNxOrD8%26begin%3D0%26len%3D86400000%26docid%3D0&nogvlm=1&thumbnailUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fvideo.google.com%2FThumbnailServer2%3Fapp%3Dblogger%26contentid%3D438c470692bc8977%26offsetms%3D5000%26itag%3Dw320%26sigh%3DD1NAUC4wUkqi56suRBE8n8juZTw&messagesUrl=video.google.com%2FFlashUiStrings.xlb%3Fframe%3Dflashstrings%26hl%3DenAlthough the panchan wasn't that good this time, I'm not deterred. It was only $8.95 and I loved my Combination Soon Dubu. From now on though, I will go to Seoul Garden during dinner time when the Soon Dubu is $10.95 but you get better panchan and a lot more of it.

Next time we have a chance, I'll ask Scott to take us to Bayside for Korean food. There was this place he took me and Sara to last time that was really really good. I have the business card, but the English name on it is Korean Restaurant which I'm not sure is the actual name. The panchan was amazing. They give you so much stuff. Sara and I were pleasantly surprised by the quantity and quality. Plus, the prices are very reasonable. I didn't have soon dobu though so I can't comment on that, but the bbq was really good. The portions are much bigger than most places too. I totally thought they heard Scott wrong and gave us more than we had ordered. The only issue I had was with the service. I thought it was ok, but Scott said it wasn't that good and blamed it on the waitress who he said was being a little racist because Sara and I are Chinese. Unfortunately, I have noticed that the service is not as good at Korean restaurants that usually have a Korean clientle when I go without someone who speaks English, but with this place because of the awesome panchan and the reasonable prices I would totally go back. I just suggest going back with someone who speaks Korean.

I've eaten here several times and I just went this past Friday. The panchan was just okay. I don't think Seoul Garden is particularly known for their panchan and it definitely varies on the day and time that you go. If you go for an early dinner on Friday they usually have more variety as opposed to on a Monday or Tuesday in the evening. Their Soon Doo Boo is the best on the block. I've had some of their other Bokeum dishes, like squid and octopus and it has been a bit overcooked, so if you're in the mood for that dish, I'd try somewhere else.I agree with Angie that they serve their Korean patrons better. On Friday, I asked for more of a certain panchan dish twice and it was not brought to me. Then Eddie asked them in Korean it was brought almost immediately. However, other times they were okay. Maybe it was just that waiter.

The Starbucks Experiment
CONTENT
I have hated Starbucks for a long time. They are symbolic of what I hate in the American food industry, a well marketed company with bad to mediocre product making the most money. I can't blame them for trying to be successful but as a true lover of food/beverages, I cringe at the thought of their coffee.Last Tues, Starbucks closed all 7100 stores across the country to re-educate their employees on how to make their drinks. I thought to myself, great, they are going to improve their product and I won't have to suffer during all the casual business meetings held at Starbucks. Today, I had some time to kill between lunch with my friend Dot and an acupuncture appointment, so I went to Starbucks to see what improvements they've made. I walked in, stood on line, bought my coffee, put my sugar and half & half in, walked out and took a sip. Nothing had changed. The experience was surely the same and the coffee was just as burnt as before. I took a few more sips and thought about it again. No, it's still going in the garbage.To leave you on a happier note, here are few places where I think you can have coffee: My favorite is Oren's Daily Roast, which has several locations. Joe the art of coffee, is acceptable. Cafe Brama has good cappuccino's. I know that some people just go to Starbucks out of convenience since there is always one near you. My advice is to opt for a deli or street vendor. Some are decent, some are even good, and they are always much cheaper. The bottom line though is that there isn't much great coffee in New York. Sad and surprising, but true. I keep Kona Joe coffee at home so I can make myself a good cup when I need one.

I love the "subtle" sarcasm.  I live in Indiana; in Bloomington, home of Indiana University. Being a college town, Starbucks is everywhere.  I live on the out-skirts of town, and the nearest location is great.  My coffee is almost always rich, bold, fresh, and piping hot..of course, it could be the time of day that I stop in..;) I actually prefer my Starbucks to any of the unique, artsy coffee shops around town.  But I'm sure that because it's a slower-paced, more relaxed location, everyone has time to focus on producing a terrific product.

Sitting in India, Starbucks connoted a certain mystique and awe to me. I wanted to try it out for a long time. I finally got a chance when I went to Bangkok and later to KL. Frankly I didn't find much of a difference in the quality of coffee versus what we get in the Indian coffee chains - Barrista and Cafe Coffee Day. Loved the ambiance though and took lot of touristy pics. I recently came across this European gentleman who made HAND MADE cappuccinos, etc, at Goa.

I think you missed the point -- they didn't close all the Starbucks to improve their coffee; they closed all their stores to teach the employees how to make a better experience for the customer.  The coffee is a small part of the equation, sadly.Americans, for the most part, value predictability over quality, which explains why there's a McDonald's right across the street from S. Maria Novella in Florence.  A few doors down is a great little trattoria.  The McDonald's is always full, not because it's good, but because it's safe.

I agree as well.  I find their coffee very unpleasant (I am being kind here).  It is burnt & bitter with an awful after-taste that I need to wash out with water.  Plus, their pricing is a little ridiculous.Places like Tim Horton's, Country Style, and Coffee Time all have much better coffee if you don't like such strong/harsh flavours ( I like my coffee on the mellow side & find it more 'digestible').

Whole Wheat Pastas
CONTENT
This is in no way a complete list of whole wheat pastas out there but here's what we thought of the five kinds we've tried.Severino Homemade Pasta is one of our favorites. The company started as a family shop in NJ over 30 years ago and we're glad they decided to expand into boxed dry pastas. We tried the stone ground whole wheat gemelli (doesn't look like other gemelli) during a family dinner. We served it with meatballs and it was a hit. Their pastas are a lot darker looking than other pastas but the texture and flavor is great. They don't taste like regular white pasta but equally terrific.Shop Rite 100% Whole Wheat Rotini is pretty good and one of the cheapest of the whole wheat pastas. The ingredient list is clean, just durum whole wheat flour. You can feel the grain slightly but you still get the chewiness of regular pasta.Delallo Organic Pastas include a whole wheat line. We tried two shapes and prefer their elbows over their linguine. The elbows are very close to regular elbows in taste and texture. We served it in a soup and the whole wheat factor was barely noticeable. When eaten alone, you do notice the difference but it still tastes very good and the bounce that we love good al dente pasta for is definitely still there. The linguine is pretty good also but the whole wheat factor is a lot more noticeable in this shape so you won't be able to pull a fast one on your kids.Trader Joe's Organic Whole Wheat Penne is pretty good but not one of my favorites. It is still chewy but lacks a bit of bounce and I would like it to be seasoned or salted more to bring out more flavor. The whole wheat is noticeable but does not add or subtract.Nature's Path makes a line of pastas under the brand name Lifestream. It includes four shapes of organic whole wheat pasta with brown flax. We tried the Spaghetti (prepared with a white clam and shrimp sauce). While the pasta is great nutrition wise, Lon and I didn't like the taste or texture. It's very grainy and tastes like a bowl of fiber. We would not buy it again.The pastas were roughly ordered from best to worst. I would certainly buy the Severino pasta again. The Shoprite and Delallo pastas are equal except that the Shoprite one is much cheaper.I would probably buy either again. The Trader Joe's pasta is a maybe and the Lifestream is a big No!

We like the Ronzoni brand.  You've had it at our house and enjoyed as well. I think the texture is pretty close to regular.

We have started to "switch" our regular pasta with whole wheat and the kids do not even notice it!  Hubby is a GREAT cook and has started making home made whole wheat pasta (when we have time) with the kids but this is a great list!thanks!

Some of you may have noticed that I'm a little obsessed with my mini-muffin pan. Everything just comes out looking so cute. So when Lon invited his friends, Shruti and Ekta, over for brunch, I wanted to experiment with miniature quiche. It was yummy so I'm sharing my recipe:Mini Red Onion and Muenster Quiche1. Cream the butter and cream cheese together. Add flour and mix until well blended.2. Form 22-24 balls (about 1″) and refrigerate for 1 hour. Preheat oven to 350 degrees 20 minutes before dough is done chilling.3. While the dough is chilling, saute onions with a dash of salt and pepper in a non-stick pan prepared with Pam. Remove when browned and softened. Set aside.4. When dough is ready, press into the bottom and sides of the mini muffin pan (sprayed with non-stick).5. Spoon a rounded teaspoon of cheese into each cup and top with 1/2 teaspoon of prepares onion.6. Beat eggs, cream, and 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Spoon into each cup. Bake for 25 minutes, until golden brown. Let stand for 5 minutes before serving.Enjoy a delicious treat!

Bison Tartare
CONTENT
As I mentioned, we bought bison meat. After the Bison Burgers for lunch, we had 8.7 ounces left so we decided to have Bison Tartare as an appetizer for dinner. It came out very good so here's the recipe.8.7 ounces bison meat1 teaspoon whole grain dijon mustard1 tablespoon minced red onion1/2 teaspoon hot sauce1/2 teaspoon worcestershire1/4 teaspoon Hungarian paprika1/4 teaspoon granulated garlic2 teaspoons capersSalt and Pepper to tasteOptional for serving:some baby greens10 slices of seedless cucumber2 teaspoons olive oil1. Mix together bison meat, mustard, onion, hot sauce, Worcestershire, paprika, and granulated garlic. Season lightly with salt and pepper (I used kosher salt and white pepper).2. Knead lightly with your fingers and pack into two ramekins (1/2 cup size). Cover with saran wrap. Refrigerate for 30 minutes.3. Place 5 slices of cucumber in a circle, onto each plate, and a few baby greens. Un-mold the Bison Tartare onto the cucumbers. Season again with salt and pepper. (This time, I used kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper.) Put a teaspoon of capers on top of each tartare and drizzle with olive oil.BTW, this is a pretty large portion for an appetizer. Lon and I are big eaters so feel free to split it into 4 portions.

Bison Meat
CONTENT
Bison meat is commonly mis-called Buffalo meat in America. Either way, it's great! I love the taste and texture, which is similar to beef but better. You can use it as you would beef in any recipe and eat happily knowing that it is really healthy.I was so happy when we spotted all natural bison meat at BJ's today. We grabbed a 4 pound pack and made burgers for lunch with my family. We had Wellsely Farm Baking Focaccia Rolls (a little big for the burgers), hot house tomatoes (on the vine), pickles, ketchup, and I sauteed some onions in butter. Delicious!As you can see, I like my burgers on the rare side.

Yuuuuum. That looks fab. Did you season the burgers before you grilled them? If so, with what?I don't like my burgers well done, either. It dries them out and turns the texture grainy. Me no likey.P.S. If you like Bison, you're sure to like Elk.

2008-03-01 20:38:00
The funny thing is I didn't season it   before pan frying them. I usually do but we were at my mom's and I couldn't find everything and we were in a rush. We seasoned the meat with salt and pepper after it came off the pans, after my mom had to go help my dad who could not find their salt and pepper. Shows you how much my dad is in the kitchen. HahaThanks for the Elk recommendation. I will have to try it!

Harbour House Crabs
CONTENT
About once a year, my mother orders a bushel of crabs from Harbour House Crabs. Last night, we headed over to her house and sat at the table covered in newspaper, ready to put in a couple of hours. The crabs were meaty and full of eggs (My mom ordered female crabs cause my dad loves the roe.), well spiced in the traditional style of Maryland Blue Crabs, Old Bay. With ten people, we could not finish the bushel. I did my part though, eating seven of the crabs, paying little attention to the garlic bread and oxtail soup my mom made to give some variety. As Lon mentioned, I love work intensive food! Eating crabs for hours is my idea of fun!

Hi Jessica ,no there is not, however when you promote a restaurant ie. Harbour House Crabs and provide link to said establishment it certinly leads anyone reading your blog to come to the conclusion that you are supporting that establishment ,unless your making statements to the contrary ,and therefore becomes ligitimate subject matter to be commented on . With that said i still offer to you the traditional recipe for real Maryland style crab cakes if you like .And Jessica even if we were to become the bestest friends ever in the history of the world ,, i would still put forth to you and anyone else the issue of eating breeding crabs ,regaurdless of what knuckle head is selling them,it is the same principal as wearing a fur coat made from a Cheetah ,if there is no market for the product then the people that provide product for that market will find some other way to make their money.Thanks for your responce ,Cheers ,Captain Pat

Hi Captain Pat!I think you have a good point about breeding crabs which is why I did not dispute it or delete your comment. BTW, we always leave comments up unless they are spam. We do not take offense to disagreement. My comment, "There is no mention of crab cakes in our post." was to clarify that we had not eaten them so I am not for or against them. I believe most restaurants have good and bad products/dishes. On the rare occasion that everything on a menu is good, I'll point it out. Because we are not a major newspaper or magazine with some large budget to try everything on the menu, I, perhaps wrongly, make the assumption that people would know from the blog that I had only eaten the crabs.Thank you for your thoughtful comments. We hope to hear more from you, even if it is in disagreement.Perhaps you could recommend a place we should order crabs from next time?Thanks!

There are tons of bread stands in the Union Square Farmer's Market but Lon and I only buy from one, Our Daily Bread. The sign is small but look for these friendly faces. This couple started out as loyal customers and now they've run this stand for 5 years.Their products are all natural and I absolutely love their scones! The Cranberry Cornmeal is my favorite and you have to try the Raisin Walnut Rolls too. They seem to always run out of these so make sure you get to the market early.It is really cold these days, which pretty much means that these breads are sitting in refrigerated temperatures. I have found that this is not as optimal as room temperature but still, I love their products.

There's nothing in the world which is as good as great bread...nothing as heady as the smell of a bakery. This is a post on a resturant with very good breads at Bombayhttp://finelychopped-k.blogspot.com/2007/11/best-breads-in-life-are-free.htmlIt's coincidental that you wrote of scones. I had read about scones in a lot of British books but had not had them till recently. I went to an old world tea shop called Tea Centre last week to review it for a web site. That's when I had scones for the first time in my life and loved it.

I mentioned in my post on Wei-Chuan Mini Buns, that frozen dumplings are a staple in our freezer. It's just perfect back-up food. We always like to try new ones, but my long time favorite brand for frozen dumplings has been Way Fong. Their dumplings have what I consider, the right thickness of dough. It's chewy and the perfect balance of filling is inside. We like to keep the Chicken Dumplings and the Pork and Chive dumplings in stock.I had the Chicken Dumplings for lunch and here's a simple fat-free dipping sauce I made:1 tablespoon soy sauce1 tablespoon white vinegar1 tablespoon mirin1 tablespoon, finely sliced fresh gingerJust mix it together and dip!

Sushi Yasuda
CONTENT
Sushi Yasuda Sushi Yasuda is the best sushi experience I have ever had for so many reasons. Every piece of sushi, every piece of sashimi, the wasabi, Chef Tom, the tea, the atmosphere, everything. After this first visit, I am now forever spoiled and may never be able to eat sushi anywhere else again.I have spent more on sushi meals at 15 East, Inagiku, and Tomoe. None can compare. The reason I hadn't come to Sushi Yasuda earlier is because I thought it would be a really expensive meal but I have found that it really doesn't have to be.Winnie and I each ordered the Sushi and Sashimi combo. You are given a choice of four pieces of sushi and a choice of 1 roll; an assortment of 3 types of sashimi is chosen for you. On top of that, we asked Tom to give us three pieces of his choice.The meal starts with a warm towel to clean your hands and a little bit of radish salad. There's no charge for a wonderful hot green tea, which is replaced throughout the meal to ensure that you're drinking it hot. They don't just refill your cup. They take the cooled tea away and give you a fresh hot cup. Winnie and I both chose salad over soup. The ginger dressing was nice and we both liked the tiny, barely visible fish that added crunch to the salad.Tom placed sashimi down first. In order of my preference: Spanish Mackerel, Blue Fin Tuna, and Fluke. All were better than my previous experiences and I have a new found respect for Spanish Mackerel. Tom advised us not to mix the wasabi into the soy sauce. Instead, you put a bit of wasabi on the fish and then dip in the soy sauce and eat. This made complete sense to me after my first bite. The fresh wasabi was delicious itself, sweet and creamy, I could eat it alone. Stirring it into the soy sauce would clearly mask the freshness of the wasabi and hide some of it's amazing flavor. Next sushi. I chose salmon, yellowtail, orange clam, and sea scallop. Every piece was amazing and my first taste of orange clam has me hooked. Tom explained how he wanted us to eat the sushi as well. He already put the wasabi in and brushed the top with soy sauce so you should not add anything as you eat it.Tom chose the next three for us. I ate the oyster first and it was like no other oyster I have ever eaten. It was amazing and I have to have it again!Then I ate the beautiful mini squid. The presentation enticed the gentlemen next to Winnie and he asked for one.After a bite, I realized it was filled with a red barbecue-like sauce. The flavor was unique and playful.The last was sea eel. The sweetness of the soft eel played so nicely with the sea salt. Just delicious.We each got to choose a roll. I chose Steel Toe Salmon and Winnie chose King Salmon. Tom split them for us so that we each got 3 pieces of each type of salmon roll. There was a clear difference in the two but I'm not really a roll person. I prefer full pieces of fish.You MUST go to Sushi Yasuda if you want really good sushi. If money is no object, go for the Omakase. I've already asked Lon for the Omakase for my birthday. But you can eat there at a reasonable price by ordering the Sushi and Sashimi Combo for about $20.50 and then adding a few things to try some specialties. I suggest letting your chef choose. Your choices for the combo are not off the same list as the a la carte but their \"regular\" fish is still nothing to sneeze at. I was impressed by every part of this meal and it cost us, in total (except they comped the sea eel), under $40 per person, easily what you could spend at any sushi place. BUT, this is not just any sushi place! Chef Tom, I'll see you next week.Update (Feb 29th): I called today to make reservations for the next two Thursdays and they told me that my chef was Mutsuru not Tom (which is what the lady next to me told me). I'll have to straighten this out next week and make sure I know who my chef is!

Hi there. Glad to see you finally had a great eating experience  are you particularly fond of Oriental food or is it that you have just been going to a lot of Chinese and Japanese restaurants recently? I first had sushi in Thailand a couple of years back...egged on be a fellow Bengali food lover. Thankfully he warned me about wasabi in advance. I don't dislike sushi though I am not sure whether I like it yet. I have posted a link. This has a sushi pic (on my mobile) from my favourite eating place, Candies, at Bandra, Mumbaihttp://finelychopped-k.blogspot.com/2008/01/candies-vs-candies.html

I am fond of lots of different foods, all ethnicities except Ethiopian. I may end up eating Asian foods a bit more though for few reasons.1. I'm Chinese and when we eat with my dad, he basically only eats Chinese food. 2. I grew up on Asian food and I find it comforting when I'm sick. A bowl of noodle soup is like a cure.3. Food in Flushing and Chinatown is really cheap.4. Sushi is healthy.

Candies would qualify as a deli. They have an an eclict mix, confectioneries, salads, sandwiches, puffs, Indian curries, Goa food, pasta, lasagnes, roasts AND now Thai and Sushi. I guess it refects the city of Bomaby which is quite cosmopoliton and the suburb it is located in, Bandra, which leads on this count. Candies is more a melting pot than a gourmet place. To me it is a Mary Poppinsish happy place which appeals to the child in me.I too love a variety of cuisines and love trying out new things. However, I am originally Bengali (a region in India)  so my favourite food or caomfort food as you put it happens to be Bengali thogh I have lived in Bengali only for half my life and I married to a Parsi from Bombay (not a Bengali)

I'm sure all the sushi chefs are great so just make sure you are sitting at the sushi bar. I think my chef was Mutsuru so I'm going to continue to sit with the same chef because I believe in building a relationship with my chef.

Fay Da Bakery
CONTENT
Fay Da Bakery, a popular Chinese Bakery with locations in Flushing and Chinatown, has now opened it's doors in Forest Hills Fay Da Bakery. This makes me extremely happy because I have been saying for years that these Chinese bakeries should branch out to different markets. As I suspected, this location was extremely packed with patrons.As I browsed the bakery, I spotted two items I had never seen before. That was quite shocking to me as I had believed that I have sampled every item a Chinese bakery has. Of course I had to buy them, plus a Coffee-Milk-Tea, to sip on our way back to the city. My enthusiasm for this creamy blend of coffee and tea encouraged Caroline to get one too. Nothing else for $0.90 could make me happier.In the evening, Lon and I sat down to have the treat I had brought home. I was proudly showing my finds to him. Isn't this beautiful? They called it a Layer Bun so I assumed there was nothing inside, just layers of good dough.Then we dug in. It was tragic. The inside tasted as it looks, like cat food. OK, I think it was really mushy tuna but yuck. Neither of us could take another bite. We tried examining the dough once more and that was not as we had expected either. It was not layer-y and actually seemed kind of stale.We moved on to the other bun. Again, gorgeous! They called this a Chocolate Walnut Bun and it was almost good. The chocolate flavor was very faint, possibly a spread that was used in an ultra thin layer, only enough to create that marbled look. It looks sweet but it was only slightly sweeter than bread and while the texture was nice for a bread, somehow the taste was just a bit awkward.This was extremely depressing for me as I had once thought, a Chinese bakery could do no wrong. So, I do warn you, not to eat these two items, but don't let this stop you from going to a Chinese bakery. The standards like roast pork buns, raisin twists and almond twists, sweet topped buns, white bread, and the list goes on, are amazing.Oh, and I have to tell you this joke that was brought to my attention by Lily and Eugene about Fay Da Bakery. (I'm hoping I can explain this joke well enough so you can get it, even if you don't speak Chinese.) In Chinese, Fay means fly and Da means prosperity. The bakery's name means something of the effect of Soaring Prosperity Bakery. However, in Chinese, the slightest change of inflection, changes the meaning of the word so if you say fay and da a bit differently, fay can mean fat and da can mean big, making it the Fat Big Bakery. Haha

Crazy Sandwich
CONTENT
In a cab today, I caught an episode of ABC's \"Neighborhood Eats\" -- a show I've seen once before, also in a cab. They talked about Watchung Delicatessen, located in New Jersey Watchung Delicatessen, that makes an awesome sandwich. If you read the subway saga (pt1, pt2) then you already know I love me some crazy sandwiches. So when I heard about \"Ben's Special\", which like other sandwiches at Watchung, was created by a patron.Here's how it's made:Slice up some breaded chicken cutlets and heat with barbecue sauce. Then top with bacon and cheddar. After melting it all together it is stuffed into a roll. Then whatever remaining space is left (and not left) is overflowed with hot macaroni and cheese. Now that's a winner!This reminds me of when I worked in Brooklyn. I used to have Sunny, my main deli man, hook me up with roast beef, bacon, yellow American, barbecue sauce and mayonnaise, hot on a hero. I loved that sandwich, particularly at $4.50 with a soda, which it cost about 11 years ago when I worked there.

Moon House
CONTENT
Moon House Moon House is next door to New Yeah Shanghai so I've thought of going so many times. They're both Shanghainese restaurants and both seem to draw crowds. I was excited that I would finally try Moon House today, expecting that it would be close competition for New Yeah and I would be forever torn from now on. Well, that certainly did not happen.We started with Scallion Pancakes which were pretty good. It seems impossible these days to find one with as many layers are they should have. I guess it's too work intensive cause my mom won't make them for me anymore either.Generally, the Chicken and Cashews were pretty standard. The unique part was that they included some broccoli stems, which I normally like, but these were bitter.This dish of Bean Curd Skins, Pork, Preserved Cabbage, and Soy Beans was standard. No better or worse than others I've eaten.The Crab and Pork Soup dumplings were just ok.Snow Pea Shoots are one of my favorite vegetables. These were over-cooked making them soggy.They had a section called Braised Noodles. We didn't know what that meant and I doubted the noodles were really braised since no one braises noodles, right? Chinese restaurants misuse English all the time so we just gave it a try. The dish came out looking so bland and unappetizing but we were surprised, it was actually quite tasty. The noodles were very soft though.The major draw to Moon House is that it's cheap! We ordered way too much food for three people, as you can see, and with tax and 20% tip, it was $16 person. Nothing was bad, but nothing was great either, so I'd rather just go to New Yeah Shanghai next door. Plus, the bathroom at Moon House is scary. You have to go out the restaurant into a dirty corridor, just to enter an even more scary bathroom, the size of a broom closet. It's disgusting because it's hard not to brush up against every part of the bathroom. Eww!

Cabana Nuevo Latina
CONTENT
I was in the neighborhood I grew up in and it was time for lunch. We decided on Cabana Nuevo Latina Cabana Nuevo Latina, a place I had fond memories of from over 10 years ago. I remember this being the first place my father liked, outside of Chinese food. He liked that the Paella came in a cast iron pot that stayed covered so that the food would not cool too fast. I also have fond memories of their Churrasco (Latin American style skirt steak) and Tostones Rellenos. Since then, they have opened four more locations, two in Manhattan and two in Florida. As with most expansions, the quality of food slides a bit but it's nice to see that the menu hasn't changed much.I didn't think any of the food today was as amazing as it was back when I was a teen (although I did not order the same things). The lunch was still good though and certainly satisfactory at it's price. I ordered the La Playa Salad, which was so massive that I could not finish about 1/3 of it. I ate all the grilled shrimp and sea scallops, but left a lot of lettuce and chopped tomatoes/onions. The salads come with a soup of the day; today it was Lentil Vegetable, which was very good. I kind of wish the cup of soup was larger and the salad smaller.Caroline ordered the Empanadas. It came with a choice of two (she liked the shrimp more than the chicken), yellow rice and black beans, and a generous salad. Again, good for it's price.It's no longer a place I would rave about, the way I did back then, but for their lunch prices (at least in Queens), it's what I would expect of the quality, and actually more than expected in quantity.

Rohm
CONTENT
I stumbled across Rohm Rohm while surfing the net for new places we could order from. The reviews on Menu Pages sounded highly positive but my verdict is that Rohm has potential but does have a lot to work on before getting 5 stars from me. Like the rest of NYC Thai places, I don't consider this food Thai food. The only exception being Sripraphai.Good news first? The best order tonight was the Drunken Noodles with Shrimp. Again, not authentic, but very tasty. They should not have left the shrimp tails on in a noodle dish but they were cooked correctly and so were the great chewy noodles. There were only six shrimp but a huge amount of noodles, which was weird since the Pad See Euw was on the skimpy side. I would order this again.I thought the flavor of the Pad See Euw was very shallow. Lon agreed but still enjoyed it, except for the very dry over-cooked chicken. He said he would try it again but with beef or shrimp.Both of us were really disappointed by the Duck Salad. The duck was so chewy that it was a jaw work out to eat it. Lon eventually gave up and spit out some pieces. Because they have reasonable prices and the drunken noodles were good, I would give them one more shot. But sadly, I still have not found authentic Thai in Manhattan.

Frozen dumplings are a staple in our freezer. They are quick and easy to heat up for a snack or meal and Lon just loves pork dumplings. Knowing this, my mom recently introduced us to Wei-Chuan Mini Buns. They are delicious for frozen product that you can steam in 10 minutes, and ta-da you have something like a soup dumpling. So far, we've tried the Pork and Chinese Spinach flavor and we'll update as we try the other ones.I find them flavorful enough to eat on it's own. Lon likes dumpling dipping sauces. Either way, we really like them and they look really cute, perfect for last minute guests. You can get Wei-Chuan products at most Chinese supermarkets but be warned that it's easy to eat too many!Here they are frozen, before steaming. We love bamboo steamers.Here they are right before I devoured them for lunch.

I eat those mini-buns and always have a bag in my freezer too! I think wei-chun is my favorite brand for dumplings and buns. I find they have more filling than other brands and they tend to be more flavorful. I've tried other brands before and most have been very disappointing. The best dumplings are homemade though. Maybe we should have a dumpling making day Jess.

While Chinese broccoli is a specific vegetable, I believe Chinese spinach is more of a loose term used for some leafy greens that they don't have an English name for. I think Chinese cabbage is also used for a few different veggies.And, absolutely, we should have a dumpling day!

On Difficult to Eat Food
CONTENT
Jessica and I often talk about how some people seem to particularly enjoy eating hard-to-eat food while others strongly prefer easy-to-eat foods. Enjoyable, Randall Munroe, who writes one of my favorite webcomics, xkcd, published a graph on this very topic!Make sure to check out the full comic on it's page: http://www.xkcd.com/388/This inspired me to make a quick graph of where some people I know fall on the one-dimensional graph of enjoyment of foods based on how difficult those foods are to eat:On the left hand extreme of the graph is my brother-in-law Stephen who has been working on opening a single brazil nut by hand since one Thanksgiving maybe six years ago-ish? He also particularly enjoys other foods that are a bit annoying to eat, such as unpeeled shrimp.Slighly to the right, but still deep in the \"enjoys difficult to eat\" area is my love, Jessica. She picks individual kernels of corn from the cob one at a time, by hand, regardless of the temperature of said cob. This can take up to an hour, I enjoy watching this procedure. She also enjoys picking every piece of meat from the tiniest crannies of crab shells. And give my woman chestnuts and she is one happy camper.Then there is Jessica's brother Justin, who is way, way on the right side. Some of his favorite foods include pre-shelled shrimp and bite-sized balls of food, such as Jessica's salmon croquettes. The goal is \"fork-to-mouth\" no other work involved, please.Where do you fall on the graph?

Rosemary Focaccia
CONTENT
My cousin Olivia brought us some fresh rosemary from Arizona so of course I had to experiment with a Rosemary Focaccia! Here's the recipe:Dough:1 cup warm water (100-110 degrees)1 teaspoon sugar1 packet (0.25 oz) rapid rise yeast2 tablespoons olive oil2 tablespoons chopped fresh rosemary2 3/4 cup AP flour1 teaspoon saltToppings:2 tablespoons olive oil and some extra to oil pan.Kosher or sea salt and pepper to taste1 cup grape tomato halves6 cloves garlic, sliced1 tablespoon chopped rosemary1. Stir together yeast, sugar, warm water in a large bowl. Let stand for 5 minutes.2. Stir in 2 tablespoons olive oil, 2 tablespoons rosemary, flour, and salt. Turn onto a floured surface and kneed dough until smooth and elastic.3. Place in an oiled bowl and cover with a damp towel and put in a warm place until dough doubles. This will take about 30 minutes.4. Preheat oven to 400 degrees and oil a jelly roll pan (half sheet pan).5. Punch the dough. Push it down into the pan and let stand for another 15 minutes.6. Spread 2 tablespoons of olive oil on top. Sprinkle with kosher or sea salt, and pepper. Sprinkle with grape tomato halves, garlic slices, and remaining rosemary.7. Bake for 15-20 minutes, or until golden brown. Best eaten immediately.The focaccia did not rise (possibly because the yeast was too old) as much as ideal but the flavor was wonderful so I decided to post the recipe anyway. The thinner focaccia makes great sandwiches.Also, keep in mind that when making focaccia, you should follow the recipe for the dough but feel free to change the toppings. Try pine nuts, black olives, red onion, sun-dried tomatoes, and other herbs.

Oscars Watching Food
CONTENT
I'm not a movie person so for me, Oscar's watching is just another excuse to eat with friends. My friend Sheryl ordered some Whole Foods Catering and invited us over to enjoy her huge screen. I was actually a little surprised that the Roasted Butternut Squash with Dried Cranberries was unevenly cooked. Some pieces were hard and some pieces were soft. The Chicken and Eggplant Parmigian and Macaroni & Cheese aligned more with my general opinion of Whole Foods prepared foods, which is that their food tastes good because they use good ingredients and simple preparation methods that taste clean. Nothing super fancy.Tammy brought over some Act II Zesty Butter Popcorn, possibly a new flavor. We all liked the light heat that wasn't initially noticeable and never built up to anything spicy.I brought over a Chocolate Meringue Pie and I was quite proud of how pretty it was. It tasted pretty good but next time I will make it less sweet so it's a darker chocolate.To end the night sweet, Sheryl sent us home with these gorgeous cookies that are too pretty to eat!

Still disgusting foods...
CONTENT
For whatever reason, I decided to read through some old emails I had archived. One was from my sister from August 14, 1998, with the subject line \"FW: Yum!\" After re-reading it was clear that the foods listed are just as gross today as they were almost ten years ago. So, without further ado, here is the email (slightly upgraded with links and some pictures):And I thought nothing could top Hormel's pickled eggs...8. Meeter's Kraut Juice (Stokely USA, a division of Chiquita Brands): Yes, that's sauerkraut juice, which is even worse than it sounds. The taste and smell can be a bit, well, harsh, but KJ is reputed by its fans to have certain medicinal benefits (as a source of vitamin C, cure for intestinal bugs, etc.), which adds up to a classic case of the cure being worse than the disease.7. Guycan Corned Mutton with Juices Added (Bedessee Imports): The best thing about this Uruguayan canned good is the very pouty-looking sheep on the package label -- he seems to be saying, \"Go on, eat me already.\" The second-best thing is the presence of both \"cooked mutton\" and \"mutton\" in the ingredients listing, which would seem to have all the mutton bases covered.6. Armour Pork Brains in Milk Gravy (Dial Corp.): If you're really looking to clog up those arteries in a hurry, you'll be pleased to learn that a single serving of pork brains has 1,170 percent of our recommended daily cholesterol intake. All the more ingenious, then, that the label on this product helpfully features a recipe for brains and scrambled eggs.5. Sweet Sue Canned Whole Chicken (Sweet Sue Kitchens, a division of Bryan Foods): From appearance (it's stewed in a quivering mass of aspic goop), this product may change forever your idea of what constitutes a chicken. Gives new meaning to the old line about meat \"falling off the bone.\"4. Musk Life Savers (Nestle Confectionery): You may think musk is a scent, but over in Australia, they think it's a candy flavor. A candy flavor that tastes disturbingly like raw meat, to be precise. But what did you expect from a country where everyone happily consumes Vegemite?3. Blind Robins Smoked Ocean Herring (recently discontinued by Bar Food Products): Possibly the world's most bizarre prepackaged tavern snack. Interestingly, the product's titular robin isn't actually blind, he's blindfolded -- the better, presumably, to avoid looking at these heavily salted herring strips, which look like giant slugs.2. Kylmaenen Reindeer Pate` (Kylmaenen Oy): This Finnish canned good may not be particulary tasty, but at least it answers the age-old question of why Rudolph was so eager for that safe, steady job on Santa's sleigh team -- he didn't want to end up as a cracker spread.1. Tengu Clam Jerky (Tengu Co.): Nothing you've ever consumed can prepare you for the horror that is clam jerky. Still, this product does score a sort of conceptual coup: If you're the sort who's always found raw clams too slimy and gelatinous for your taste, these dried, shriveled mollusks will help you dislike clams on a whole new level.

Hi. I think some disgusting foods for Americans may not be delicacy for other cultures.I am Japanese and dried clam is actually eaten as snack food. I don't like it. But it tasted OK with beer. Also I noticed some of the American food ad on TV seems to be disgusting to me.

Fumiko, you're absolutely right. Cultures differ in what they find appetizing. One of my instructors back in culinary school introduced me to Vegemite. It is eaten by most Australians and most of the class, here in America, ran to the garbage.

It really annoys me when someone gets sappy/disgusted by people eating reindeer meat; it tastes good! Don't judge a book by its covers. And on a separate note, the Finnish 'ä' should not be spelled out 'ae' in English, because it is a completely different letter, and pronounced completely differently from 'ae'. Just to let you knowCongrats on the blog of note!

Waffles are Really an Excuse to Eat Dessert as a Meal
CONTENT
We had Caroline and Eddie over yesterday to break in our new waffle maker, the Villa Ware 2010 Uno Pro Belgian Gravity Waffler. It heats up quickly and makes good waffles even if you don't follow instructions, Lon! It's also easy to clean, mostly because not much sticks too it. I did spray it with PAM before heating it.We made a standard flavored waffle so that we could go all out on the toppings. We had pure maple syrup, caramel sauce, a powdered sugar shaker, and sweet cream butter on hand. I made a raspberry sauce out of frozen raspberries that I thawed, sweetened, pureed, and strained. Next a Apricot Apple Compote:10 dried tart apricots 4 medium apples, peeled and sliced 1 tablespoon light brown sugar 1/2 teaspoon lemon zest 1/8 teaspoon ground cinnamon1. Soak the apricots in 1/2 cup of water for 30 minutes. 2. Reserve 3 tablespoons of the soaking water and chop the apricots. 3. Put apricots, apples, brown sugar, and reserved water in a 3 1/2 Quart pot and heat on medium heat. Stir thoroughly until bubbling lightly. 4. Turn the heat down to a simmer and cover for 20 minutes or until apples are soft. 5. You can serve it warm or room temperature. Of course we also made freshly whipped cream and Caroline and Eddie brought some awesome strawberries. For a savory note, Lon made incredible maple bacon. He baked the bacon in our convection oven on a rack with a jelly roll pan underneath, turning and basting it with pure maple syrup every 5 minutes for 3 cycles at 350 degrees and 2 cycles at 400 degrees. Wow, what you can do with two ingredients!Here's some samples of how we ate the waffles...Some just like syrup lakes. I like lots of fruit and whipped cream.Sweet and Savory.... I had compote and raspberry sauce left over so I decided to use it for cupcakes too. I was going to a fondue party (which was awesome) so I made simple vanilla cupcakes and topped them with the apricot apple compote and a spoonful of raspberry sauce. It was right up my alley, dessert that's a little tart and not so sweet.

The pictures of the waffles look really yummy. I prefer mine with honey and butter though. I love the blend of salt which comes from butter and the sweetness of honey. My wife and I often got to a local deli at Bombay to have waffles for breakfast on Sunday.

The Trader Joe's Chronicles
CONTENT
On Friday night, my friend Angie brought tons of goodies from Trader Joe's. The winner of the night was Double Rainbow Coffee Blast Ice Cream. She had eaten Double Rainbow ice cream in California before and was so excited to see it here. It was delicious. I really hope Trader Joe's continues to carry their ice cream. Yum!She also got a Tiramisu Gelato from the Trader Giotto's line. While it tasted pretty good, it didn't taste like gelato to me. It also hovered on the overly sweet side. It is a nice presentation (made to look like tiramisu) so you can just open the box and serve.Because I had just blogged about dried cranberries, Angie picked up some Milk Chocolate Covered Cranberries. We were psyched but sadly the layer of chocolate was too thick and completely over-powered the dried cranberries. In most pieces, we weren't able to taste the dried cranberries at all. I think I was most disappointed in the frozen ready-to-bake Chunky Chocolate Chip Cookies. Each cookie spread differently; most of them spread too much. I wouldn't describe them as chunky and they were really too sweet.I'm actually kind of surprised that I didn't like some of the products. (I did love the Double Rainbow Coffee Blast Ice Cream.) I usually like Trader Joe's stuff. We've also noticed that Trader Joe's changes their products a lot so I guess they have to try a product to see if people like it? Unfortunately, several products I have loved in the past are never there anymore. If someone from Trader Joe's is reading this, bring back the blueberry popcorn and the mango chili vinegar!

I don't think I *should* recommend them because they're addictive, but, they're ADDICTIVE!  I miss them.  They're in the chips section.  I love their wines.  Oh, I miss it. =(

I totally agree with everything you wrote Jess. I'm most disappointed with the chocolate cranberries. I was really hoping they would be good. I guess in a way its good otherwise I think I could become addicted to them.

Q&A on Rosemary
CONTENT
Olivia asked:\"I brought back fresh rosemary from my uncle's yard in Arizona. I will give you a bag of it. Can you suggest a recipe using rosemary?\"Rosemary is an earthy herb; it has a strong aroma that is reminiscent of the forest (think almost like pine). It can easily overwhelm other flavors, therefore, it traditionally goes with very flavorful ingredients. The most common is probably lamb.Lamb is one of the most strongly flavored meats, so it can easily stand up to rosemary. Because lamb is fatty, rosemary is often combined with with lemon juice to dress the meat-the acidity helps cut the fat. Don't forget to use plenty of salt and pepper. Here is one recipe that is for Halibut (a strongly flavored fish), but you could easily substitute lamb, pork, or chicken in place of the fish.The reason you'll often see rosemary with chicken is interestingly the exact opposite of lamb. Chicken has no real flavor of its own, so it can take on the flavor of whatever you season it with; that's one reason why chicken is in so many dishes. Rosemary and garlic add all the flavor chicken needs.Because of rosemary's foresty / woody flavor, it's usually considered a fall or winter seasoning. Therefore, there are tons of stews that use rosemary as a base flavor. Here's a carrot and lentil stew.And, a third recommendation for, perhaps, what is my favorite use of rosemary, a seasoning for foccacia! Here is one recipe for the savory bread and below is a picture of my most recently baked foccacia, which in fact, was covered in rosemary.Remember to use very good, coarse salt whenever you use rosemary -- kosher at least, grey salt is even better. They go hand in hand.Good luck!

Teddy's Bar & Grill
CONTENT
Teddy's Bar & Grill Teddy's Bar & Grill looks more like a neighborhood bar but it seems like more people come to eat, at least during lunch time. Even in the crazy snow (yesterday), the place filled up for lunch. It's a casual and comfortable place where they serve simple non-inventive American food. It seems like a safety spot, where you can expect that the food will be good but not amazing, for a reasonable price.Caroline and I both ordered off the specials menu. She chose a vegetable pasta with cream sauce. The veggies looked fresh and the pasta was cooked correctly.My Mussels with Andouille Sausage sat in a creamy red pepper and onion broth. Most of the mussels were plump and there were no dead ones in the pile. I'm a bit surprised that the mussels weren't served with bread for sopping but I was full.....I know that these Spicy Curly Fries are likely just frozen product that they throw into a fryer but they're still good. I'm a sucker for French fries!Teddy's is not a place I would go out of my way for but if your in the area and not feeling adventurous, it's a safe meal. Try to get a window seat!

OK 218
CONTENT
My incredibly sweet friend Lily, picked up dinner for us from Chinatown last night. I was craving noodle soups as I often do all winter. She decided to try OK 218 OK 218 (another great Chinese restaurant name, wink), a place she had never been to, so she was concerned over the quality. I said, \"No problem. Even average stuff in Chinatown is usually better than Chinese food in our neighborhood.\" That ended up being exactly the case. She brought over a Wonton Noodle Soup, a Beef Noodle Soup, Soy Sauce Chicken, and Beef and Tofu Over Rice. It was all standard for Chinatown fair but that means it was enjoyable and well worth the super cheap prices. By cheap, I'm talking noodle soups for $4-$5 and a variety of dishes over rice that range from $3.75-$5.75. Thanks Lily!

Time Out Schools Rachel Ray

Lon and I have made fun of Rachel Ray's $40 a Day so many times. It's a ridiculous show concept. Any one of my friends can eat for less than $40 a day in New York City. Lily and I were just talking about it today and she found that Time Out New York has found a way for you to eat for $20 a week in New York City.

I've always thought the same thing about the $40 a day show.  You probably eat breakfast free in the hotel, so that leaves only one or two more meals to pay for.
Monica

40 dollars a day on vacation for a person who likes to eat more than just street or carnival food is very inexpsensive. I have to agree with ehollo.  I love Rachel Ray's shows including this one.

Hung Solo
CONTENT
Some people in my family keep kosher, and several of my close friends are kosher. One of the problems of keeping kosher is finding great food at restaurants. In my experience, most of the time kosher restaurants sacrifice flavor for the fact that they must pay for the kashrut certification. That said, there are quite a few delicious kosher restaurants, particularly in New York City, where the religious Jewish population has a big influence. One of the better restaurants is Solo Solo located in the Sony Building, owned by the same folks who brought the delicious The Prime Grill The Prime Grill NYC.Well, in a move to make what is already good food even better, Solo has wooed Top Chef Season 3 winner Hung Huynh to guest chef for the month of March. This is exciting for anyone dining in New York City, not just those who are kosher. And it will be an interesting challenge for Hung. I'm looking forward to trying it myself.New York Times has a bit more on this story and a few other recent chef moves. Thanks to Kasi for bringing this to our attention! P.s. did anyone catch my clever/geeky title for this post?

Assi Brand Organic Tofu
CONTENT
When you buy tofu from Asian supermarkets, it's usually reasonably priced. It's about double at places like Whole Foods and Citerella, and they don't carry good brands of tofu either. I recommend trying to get to Korea Town Plaza for the Assi Brand Organic Tofu. A 16 oz box is somewhere between $1.49 and $1.99. Fresh tofu, like the ones sold on the corner of Grand Street and Bowery, are still the best, but they only last a few days so I like to keep a few safety boxes in the fridge. The Assi Brand Organic Tofu usually lasts several weeks from the time you bought it. (Expiration date is marked on each box.) Plus, it's organic.I'm actually really surprised that an Asian company is putting out organic stuff. Taste and cost always seems to come first, above health. I am happy though and will keep buying the organic tofu, hoping that my support will get more Asian companies to produce organic products.I used it to make some Korean Tofu Soup for lunch today. I ate the whole 16oz box. Yum!

it's absolutely amazing the awesome things (with awesome prices) that you can find at asian markets. cheapest lemongrass, tofu, napa cabbage, thai chiles, daikon, etc. and most of it looks so much better than you can find in conventional grocery stores, even if it isn't organic. not to mention pantry items such as curry pastes, tamari, miso bases and dashi.and i also agree with you about the dried cranberries, from the past entry. actually, one of my favourite lunches that i make for myself about three or four times a week at work is a salad of mixed field greens, goat cheese, dried cranberries, walnuts and raspberry vinaigrette. i was actually planning on doing a blogpost about it soon. very nice blog, i will be back, and congrats on being a 'blog of note' on blogger! cheers, darlin!

I tried tofu, I even fried it to get it to taste better, but plain tofu is not my thing. I did try the Assi brand, but it was still a bit bland. I know Whole Foods sells more expensive tofu than the Asian Stores but at least their I was able to find a tasty tofu that lasts lots longer than Assi does because it comes frozen and it is also certified organic too! The brand was Helen's Kitchen Tofu Steaks, they have two varieties, but I only tasted the GardenSteak, which was great, they have a website listed on the box, http://www.helensfoods.com where you can find a store location too.

I Love Dried Cranberries
CONTENT
Dried Cranberries are the bomb! We always keep a huge bag of Craisins (one brand of sweetened dried cranberries) in our pantry since they have a long shelf life and are super versatile. I eat large handfuls of them plain and use them in so many recipes. Add them to cereal/granola, breads, quick breads, cookies, and pies.Since Lon and I prefer dried cranberries over raisins, we tend to replace raisins in most recipes with Craisins. We just like the flavor more. They have a tangy-ness that raisins don't and the red color is prettier too.They pair really well with apples/pears, oatmeal and grains, nuts, and cheeses, oh and of course turkey.Try some of these recipes using dried cranberries:Pumpkin Cranberry BreadApple Cranberry PieCranberry Pistachio BiscottiDried cranberries are also nutritious and high in fiber. However, most of the ones we consume have lots of added sugar. But, I still love them!

Kingswood
CONTENT
Kingswood Kingswood is a scene, a people watching restaurant, not a people eating restaurant. The first clue is that there are way more people crowded by the bar then people seated in the dining room. After eating there, I fully understand why. The over-priced food is just not that good.The meal started out well, with a basket of warm bread and good olive oil. We finished it quickly and started on another basket. The rest of the food was pretty disappointing.Our waitress described one of the specials as raw oysters with hand-made chorizo. She told us to cut the chorizo and place it on top of the oyster to eat it. Some add tabasco. We had never heard of such a dish and were eager to try it. The oysters and chorizo did not make a magical pairing. The chorizo, that was good but did not taste like chorizo, over-powered the not-so-flavorful oysters completely. The part that pissed me off most was that they hadn't flipped the oysters in the kitchen. The oyster was still fully attached and broke into a mush when we tried to eat it.Lon's main course, the Goan Fish Curry, was not an attractive dish. The flavors and textures were average, which made Lon wish more that they hadn't run out of the crab linguini (around 7:45pm), his first choice.Nothing on the menu stood out to me. Lamb Chops are often my fallback when I can't decide what I want. At $27, I thought it would be pretty good. I was quite surprised that my whole dish was luke warm at most and the lamb had no flavor. It didn't even really taste like lamb, just bland meat of some sort. The tomato orzo underneath was so-so, same goes for the over-cooked and oily string beans and brussels sprouts. Again, I need to point out that it was $27.I was so excited to see Truffle Fries on their menu. I was hoping that they would be my beloved Disco Fries from the now, gone Diner 24. Alas, they were not. The fries were actually very good, thin and crispy, but you had to close your eyes and use imagination to taste the truffle. The glob of herbed mayonnaise on top would've been better on the side.Sheryl ordered a Beet Soup and the Pork Belly. I'm not sure how she felt about the meal since she made no comments, other than liking the bread. Lon and I would certainly never go to Kingswood again. The food is very expensive for poor executions of half thought out ideas and mediocre ingredients.

Naniwa
CONTENT
Naniwa Naniwa is your average Japanese restaurant, with a somewhat longer menu than most. I wouldn't recommend the sashimi there since Lon's order was expensive at $18.95 (during lunch) for mediocre fish. He didn't think the pieces were cut well, resulting in tendonous bites. The wasabi was weak but the accompanying miso soup was very good, rich in flavor with lots of tofu. He also ordered an octopus and scallion appetizer with a mustard dressing that was over-sauced and again average.I ordered a Japanese Hot Pot, one with seafood and egg. Most of the seafood and the udon noodles were over-cooked but the broth was very good, rich with the sweetness that comes from seafood, not sugar. It really made me sad since it had so much potential. Is it really too much to ask to not over-cook seafood?Although I wasn't impressed with my order or Lon's, Sara got the Lunch Special of the Day (I think it changes daily) which did impress me. It wasn't spectacular food but it is possibly one of the best Japanese lunch deals in NYC, at least midtown. For $11, it included salad, a piece of futomaki, 2 pieces of cucumber roll, 2 nigiri (salmon and fluke), a large bowl of tempura soba, and fruit. Naniwa isn't good enough to make a special trip for but if you work in the area, it's worth checking out their daily lunch special.

Is this place owned/run by Chinese people? Or non-Japanese people? That's my litmus test for whether the food will be good at a Japanese place.If you want good japanese food and willing to take a trek out to Long Island, I would suggest Yamaguchi in Port Washington, on Main Street across the street from the LIRR station. Yes, it's owned and run by Japanese, and the menu is quite authentic. Although most of the clientele are American, and half the menu is geared toward their tastes (i.e. sushi/sashimi combos, teriyaki this or that), the other half of the menu is similar to that of a traditional izakaya, serving small tapas-style dishes.To get their, just hop on the Port Washington line LIRR train from Penn Station, and take it all the way to the last stop.
Lon
2008-02-21 14:08:00
Having grown up in Port Washington, Yamaguchi was the first restaurant where I ever had sushi, I believe I was 15 (or so), and my friend Marc took me there.  The two of us sat at a table directly in front of the sushi bar.When I picked up the blob of wasabi and asked my friend what it was he (I guess humorously) told me it was something other than what it was (Honestly I forget what he said) and so I popped the whole thing in my mouth.Well all the chefs at the sushi bar witnessed it and thought it was hilarious.  My nose felt like it was on fire, but I enjoy a good prank.Anyway, the restaurant was definitely good and I went back many times, and of course, now, I'm totally hooked on sushi.Thanks for the walk down memory lane!

Who Doesn't Hate Sandra Lee?
CONTENT
I've been complaining about Sandra Lee for a while now, making little notes to compile a blog about this when Lon spotted \"I Still Loathe Sandra Lee: February 2008″, on Foodie NYC. Bravo Joe! You say it well. May I just add a few things:As Lon already mentioned in his review of celebrity chefs, Sandra Lee loves saying, \"All you gotta do...\" and then continues with multiple steps. It is just as annoying as the way Rachel Ray says E.V.O.O. and then continues to say Extra Virgin Olive Oil. Could you imagine if we went around explaining all of our acronyms?Ok, back to Sandra Lee. Joe already talks about how she basically promotes processed food. Yes, feed your family yellow #5, trans fats and extra sodium. I wonder if people will start suing Sandra Lee the way they sued McDonald's for making their kids obese.But, this method of cooking is also very costly. If you're trying to save time, you might as well just buy the food already made because you're not saving money by cooking this way, at least not in Manhattan. Here are some ready-made or prepared things she uses. I did a few price comparisons at Garden of Eden and Fresh Direct (neither had all these things) to illustrate:1. Cole slaw ingredients sliced in a bag at $2.99 for 12 oz vs buying cabbage and carrots at $0.99 per pound which would cost you $0.75 for the 12oz2. Peeled garlic is $2.49 for 6oz vs. garlic bulbs at $2.99 per pound.3. Taco seasoning mix is $0.99 for 1.25 oz (4 tablespoons) vs. Chili powder at $0.79 for 4.37 oz, onion powder at $0.79 for 3 oz, and salt (negligeable), plus skip the chemicals.I couldn't find things like frozen pre-chopped onions and powdered pizza dough mix (both things I've seen her use) but you should get the point by now....Another factor is that things like pre-chopped, peeled, and pre-cut produce are generally not as sanitary. It also won't last as long so how often are you going to go grocery shopping?Has anyone else noticed that she seems like an alcoholic?After some research it seems that Anthony Bourdain is not a fan either:~taken from a guest blog on Michael Rulman

I was kinda confused by her show at first (thought it was tacky and promoted alcohol), until I watched her bio on TV, and gained a greater respect simply by the realization that she represents a lot of busy people who are cooking this way anyway. Whether due to laziness, time constraints, or simply being a stranger to cooking in a kitchen, whatever, she's real. So to hate on her style and mission, is to hate on a large group of people, but use her as a scapegoat. I'm sure your readers aren't too cool to enjoy a cocktail in the middle of the day, and probbly eat much worse over the counter without her instruction. (Just hope they don't start decorating after that.) Censuring Sandra Lee for using things on the market doesn't do much, but give y'all a sense of community and superiority. And isn't that what the web's all about? Say what you will, but at least thank her for bringing you all together.

I'm not a big fan of processed foods, but I'll always have a soft-spot in my heart for Sandra Dee. She does everything with such style and pizzazz—and always a smile. And what kind of chef doesn't like a drink while they're cooking? What are you—a bunch of hoity-toity puritans? We could all learn a lesson or two from Sandra Dee's positive, playful, youthful attitude.

Great write-up. The only reason why I would stop on her show while flipping through channels is to see what color her kitchen is this time. Man, I wish I had EVERY color of kitchen-aid mixer and outfits to match my curtains! (blech)

I'm so happy to converse on this subject with all of you. Thank you for the great comments!!I did watch Sandra's Bio also and while I'm impressed by her background and the fact that she's making a lot of money, I still disagree with her message. (I'm impressed with how rich Starbucks is too but I still hate their coffee.) My busy working mom and Lon's busy working mom managed to get lots of non-processed food on the dinner table every night.Also, it's not like Lon and I never eat potato chips out of a bag....We just try to limit processed food where we can, especially when it comes to feeding children. It just scares me that some moms out there might be using her recipes to fee their children every day without knowing what that means. Hey, those people who sued McDonald's claimed that they did not know feeding their kids McDonald's for lunch and dinner 5-6 days a week would make them obese.

Cookies like Blondies: PB&B
CONTENT
We bought a pile of bananas from BJ's and thanks to the insane climate conditions in our apartment, they pretty much went straight from green to brown. Also from BJ's, Jessica picked up some Smuckers' Natural Creamy Peanut Butter. We were very excited by the ingredient list: peanuts, salt. So, tonight I started searching for a cookie recipe that used both, and I found quite a few. After reviewing them, I selected \"Craving Cookies\" by Talia on AllRecipes. The recipe sounded bizarre, but I gave them a shot.I followed the recipe and instructions exactly and enjoyed the final product. This recipe is deceiving in that it seems simple (due to the few ingredients), but is actually hard to do correctly, because the dough is very dry. If the chef over mixes, the glutens will become tough and ruin the cookie. The three tips I suggest adhering to are: (1) stir the wet mixture very, very well before adding the dry products; (2) under mix the dry mixture; and, (3) after rolling the ball shape for the cookie, press them a bit flatter, into the shape of a bottle cap -- the cookies won't spread.As far as cooking time went, the recipe calls for 10-12 minutes at 375 degrees F. Since we have prosumer convection oven, I cooked at 360 with convection for 10 minutes, then turned off the oven and left the cookies in for another two minutes. Then I let them rest on the baking sheet, out of the oven for another 5-6 minutes before transferring them to a cooling rack.This is a distinctive cookie and the result is quite enjoyable. Jessica and I both felt the texture is more like that of a blondie, just in a cookie shape. Also, since we used the natural peanut butter, rather than the typical, commerical product, the cookie came out less sweet than one might otherwise expect. We both like it. Another benefit of this recipe is that since it is dry and eggless, it would be the perfect cookie dough to eat raw, such as in ice cream!

Main Street Mom, yes, you called it!  We have one larger silpat and one other silicone form, which is not from Demarle, but rather the Gastroflex Tatin Mold. We have been planning to pick up a few other mold shapes and try them out.  Your request for recipes is actually a great idea for a blog post!  Because your implication is dead on: some recipes are simply better for silpat than others.So, while for now, I'll just call out the fact that you're right and there is a difference I think we'll leave the full discussion for a full blog post.  Thanks for the idea!!

Ghirardelli Intense Dark - Espresso Escape
CONTENT
For inexpensive commercially available chocolate, I love Ghirardelli's Espresso Escape, dark chocolate with finely ground espresso beans. It's yummy and cheap, perfect for that bit of chocolate I need in the afternoon. I prefer the bag of individually wrapped pieces (around $6) but it also comes in a 3.5 oz bar (around $5).Lon doesn't believe in Valentine's Day since he says that every day is V-day. So, bring home a little chocolate for no occasion at all.

What do calories look like?
CONTENT
In case you didn't already know, food is used by our bodies to provide energy. Our bodies break down food into basic components and attempts to convert those components into sugars. Then we burn those sugars to keep us alive. The energy that is produced in the burning process is measured in calories (actually kilo-calories). We need about 2000 calories per day to maintain weight (there are calculators to help you figure out how many calories you need). However, Americans consume an average of 2,700 calories per day (check out this great article on calorie consumption from the USDOA). When your body takes in unneeded calories it has two choices: excrete those calories, which it prefers not to (waste not, want not); or convert the sugar to fat and attach it to your ass. I think we all know which way the body prefers.When you're eating, how do you keep track of calories, without going insane? The answer is to learn what calories look like! Fortunately, in this day and age, we have the people of the Internet, who apparently have the time and interest to photograph foods at specific calories levels. Sweet (no pun intended).Without further ado, enjoy \"what calories look like\":

Danal
CONTENT
I'm so excited that Danal Danal moved to my neighborhood, about two blocks from where I live. I never went to the previous location so I can't compare but the food we had for brunch today was good. Lon enjoyed his burger, which came with salad and the thin fries I like. The fries were a bit cold but still crispy. Becky had Poached Eggs, their version of Eggs Benedict with sausage, and she was very happy with it. I ordered the Croissant French Toast apprehensively because it's a dish that often comes too sweet. The waitress said it wasn't overwhelmingly sweet so I gave it shot thinking I could eat some of Lon's burger. Surprisingly, it was perfect for me, the least sweet French Toast I've had at a restaurant. The sauteed apples and walnuts added a light sweetness to basically unsweetened French Toast and that's all I needed. It really left me wondering though if it's always this un-sweet. (My friend Caroline had it the next day and confirmed my suspicions. Her French Toast was very sweet so I guess mine was a fluke.)I didn't like the coffee because it was too acidic but aside from that, the food was good and came in generous portions, and at a moderate price. What I love though is the decor. It has a homey feel like you're in a Bed & Breakfast on the French country side that makes me want to sit there all day. I am so sad that I forgot my camera but I promise to take pictures next time, which will be very soon.

Attune Probiotic Wellness Bars
CONTENT
Probiotics, the good bacteria in your digestive tract, have become a hot topic in healthy eating. I've seen supplements and yogurts proudly proclaiming inclusion of probiotics, and I've wondered if I should be adding them to my diet. I don't have any digestive problems so it slipped my mind until recently, when my cousin Olivia (a doctor), recommended that I eat yogurt (for the probiotics) to prevent the diarrhea that antibiotics can cause.Coincidentally, Attune Foods sent us some of their Probiotic Wellness Bars. They have two types. One is just like chocolate, my favorite is the dark chocolate. Since I eat chocolate pretty often anyway, I could easily see myself eating the Attune dark chocolate bar. The other is various flavors of yogurt granola bars. They are a bit sweet for my taste, but are similar to other commercial brands of granola bars. It's always a plus when you can get food with health benefits, without sacrificing flavor. And, if you don't like yogurt, you now have another option!

Valentine's Day Dinner for Jessica
CONTENT
In planning a romantic dinner for your significant other, there are several factors to consider. First and foremost, consider what your mate's tastes are. I know Jessica is not crazy for too sweet, and she relishes the acidic. I also know my woman loves lighter foods. When planning your meal, don't forget that you need to eat too, so balance the selections with what you like. Second, consider how your partner likes to eat. Jessica really likes to avoid waste and particularly seems to like fusion dishes inspired from classical cuisines. She also wants her meals to be balanced with veggie, protein, and grains. And third, come up with a consistent theme in both taste and appearance. All three of these factors helped me dream up my Valentine's Day menu for Jessica.Appetizer: Blackstick, Pork, & Pear in EndiveEven 1/4″ dice of Forelle Pear and cooked, left-over pork tenderloin combined with English Blackstick, with just a touch of salt and black pepper. Served in rinsed endive leaves. The saltiness of the cheese was a great accent against the pear (they're a classic combination) plus the protein texture from the pork. It came together really well. The creaminess of the cheese was just perfect.Entree: Grapefruit-Steamed Turbot Fillet with Blackberry-Ginger SauceA large grapefruit was juiced into our wok, then the rinds were added, plus some water and marjoram. After bringing that to a boil, seasoned turbot fillets were placed into a bamboo steamer over the wok.Meanwhile, minced, fresh ginger took a sautee in unsalted butter with kosher salt and white pepper. After a few minutes, cayenne pepper and granulated garlic were added. Then fresh blackberries and cold water were added. Throughout the covered, low simmer I regularly stirred and mashed the blackberries. The aroma filled the air. Finally, I strained the sauce through a fine mesh and pressed all the liquid out.After plating the fish, I dressed it with the sauce. The fish was buttery and perfectly cooked, but I was let down when I tasted it. It did not take enough of the acid I was hoping for. I should have bathed it in the grapefruit juice after cooking it. But it was delicious and the sauce was perfectly fruity and tangy.Grain: Parsley RiceComing home late from work, I wanted to move dinner along as quickly as possible. So I tried to cook things is the ideal order. The first item that started was rice, since that takes 25 minutes by itself. I measured out a cup of rice, added a healthy dose of dried parsley and kosher salt. After bringing it to a boil, then steaming it for 20 minutes, I fluffed it and let it sit until plating.Vegetable: Starry, Yellow Wax BeansAfter rendering out the fat from chopped bacon, I quickly mixed in thinly sliced halves of star fruit and quarters of cherry tomatoes. The mixture was lightly seasoned with black pepper and marjoram. And finally, cleaned and blanched yellow wax beans were mixed in.While the bacon should have been a bit crisper, I really loved the fat from the bacon against the fruitiness of the star fruit and acid from the tomatoes. The crisp wax beans were amazing in the dish.Final PlatingThe rice and fish were plated on our most basic white plates. The overall look was very clean: white plates, white rice, and white fish. Then I dressed the fish with the beautiful, dark red sauce. Normally, this color contrast would be a bit too stark for a meal, but it seemed appropriate for Valentine's Day, so that it was focused on the red.The yellow beans, yellow starfruit, and red tomatoes were a great side accent to the plate.Dessert: Blackberry & Pear Sauce over Almond CakeI really wanted to pick up on all the flavors we've had in the dessert. I took left-over almond cake that Jessica made for Monica and Sarah (who launched her new food blog! Savory / Sweet) and cut them into about 1.5″ rounds with a cookie cutter (with corrugated edges).Then I added honey and vanilla extract to the leftover sauce from the fish. I tossed in diced pear and blackberries and dressed the cake. Final decoration included a whole blackberry and powdered sugar.In summary, we both enjoyed the meal very much, and we particularly loved how the dessert tasted. It was so distinctive: spicy and sweet, just wonderful. I had seconds.We hope you get seconds of everything you taste on your Valentine's Day.

D'agostino is Disgusting
CONTENT
At the end of January, my friend told me about a promotional discount at D'agostino where $30 would be taken off your first on-line order. Of course I took advantage of that. The website was terrible and they didn't have several regular supermarket items I was looking for, not even jalapeños. I thought, well, I'm getting free stuff. But then again, Fresh Direct had a similar promotion worth $50, and their website and product selection was way better.When I got the delivery, which was somewhere between $6-$9 (different prices showed up at checkout, on their website, and on my receipt), the eggplant was partially rotted. I didn't bother calling to complain because again, free stuff.I didn't think about D'agostino again until I got my credit card bill and realized that I was charged the full amount. It took three phone calls before I was credited the $30 from the promotion. On the last phone call, the manager told me I was already given $10 off (the day of the purchase) and they just credit me the other $20 today. I explained how that was still incorrect, insisted a few more times, and she left me on hold to go check. It turns out I was right, they hadn't given me any discount the first day and I now still needed to creditme another $10 (since they supposedly just credited the $20 today).If you made a purchase during this promotion, I highly recommend checking that you actually got the discount. I will certainly never shop at D'agostino again. They completely missed the idea behind a promotion - to impress a new potential customer so that they may become a repeat customer. Not only was I not impressed with their website, service, or products, they just wasted my time with all these phone calls and made me feel as if there was ill intent behind their promotion. I am truly disgusted.

Grand Sichuan Chinese Restaurant
CONTENT
There are several restaurants with some version of Grand Sichuan Chinese Restaurant, Grand Sichuan Chinese Restaurant as their name. This one, chosen for Karen's birthday, specializes in Hot Pot. Their ingredients are fresh and they have a decent selection. I did ask for taro, which was not listed on their menu, but they had it. Most importantly, they have a real Sichuan style spicy stock. Their wontons (not like regular wontons) are a must! We ordered a second plate.Oh, and if you haven't had the frozen tofu that I mentioned in Chinese New Year at my Mom's, you can try that here too.

Fork It Over - Steak or Seafood?
CONTENT
I've been reading Alan Richman's book, Fork It Over, The Intrepid Adventures of a Professional Eater. It's nothing mind blowing, but it is easy and entertaining reading. It's a compilation of his articles which makes it even better reading for train rides. I only read a few pages at a time.I was just reading his Ten Commandments for Diners, and number 4 reads, \" Don't order steak at a seafood restaurant. However, seafood at a steak restaurant is never bad.\" I thought about this for a while. I don't think I've ever ordered steak at a seafood restaurant. It just seems like common sense to me not to. Then, I thought about seafood at a steak place. I can only think of one instance, since I usually order steak at a steak restaurant. Lon and I shared a Strip Steak and a Seared Tuna dish at Strip House. The fish was fresh but the preparation lacked flavor and seasoning. I'm not sure if Mr. Richman was only referring to freshness/quality of ingredient when he said \"never bad\" but I don't remember either of us wanting to finish the tuna that night. I'm really curious to hear what others have experienced in terms of steak at seafood restaurants or seafood at steak restaurants. Please do tell!

My only experiences eating seafood at steakhouses are from when I was in college, and didn't eat any red meat or poultry. We would go to places like Outback Steakhouse and I would end up with like, the coconut shrimp appetizer (and petals off the bloomin' onion). The shrimp as I recall was pretty terrible, but I sort of assume the steak wasn't fab either, it being the kind of place that it was.In a fine dining restaurant I would imagine that the seafood would be up to par regardless of the restaurant's emphasis.

I myself have never ordered a fish entree at a steakhouse.  That is just weird to me (unless of course you don't eat red meat). But...I have ordered seafood appetizers which have been really good (i.e. crab cakes, oysters, scallops, etc). In my experiences at steakhouses, the ones where I've really liked the steak I also have generally enjoyed the appetizers, sides and desserts as well.  So, I would assume that their seafood options would be just as good as everything else. Same goes the other way, I think its pretty much guaranteed that if a steakhouse can't make a good steak, then everything else will taste like poop.

When we went to BLT Prime, I ordered sea scallops which was served over risotto as an appetizer. It was very good. However, the other times I've gone to steakhouses I haven't ordered fish or seafood.

Spicy and Tasty
CONTENT
Spicy and Tasty Spicy and Tasty is actually a creative name in the realm of English names for Chinese restaurants. I'm glad they took a step up from Happy Wok, Double Happiness, and East Seafood Palace. The decor is also a bit less gaudy, except for the ugly plastic chili peppers displayed in an inside window.At the front of the restaurant, all the cold appetizers are on display. They all look amazingly fresh and my mom said that they're all pretty good. She's tried most of them. You don't want to order too many during the same visit though. Most of them share the same marinade of Sichuan chili oil. Their oil is authentic in flavor and extremely aromatic.My mom wanted me to try the Wild Vegetables which had a nice crunch. I enjoyed it but I only wanted a few bites. The portion was just too big.There are a couple if signature Sichuan dishes that you have to try at a Sichuan place. Dan Dan Noodles, Red Oil Dumplings, and Water Cooked Beef. The Dan Dan Noodles served as my brother's birthday noodles last night. Chinese people eat noodles for birthdays to signify wishing your loved ones a long life.The noodles were a bit flat in flavor which surprised me but the Red Oil Dumplings were quite good, displaying the very distinct flavor of Sichuan chili oil.I asked my mom why this spicy dish is called Water Cooked Beef. Is it a joke? She didn't know but it is nothing like what it sounds like. The dish is traditionally ultra spicy, \"Ma-la\", meaning numbing. I was kind of disappointed that this dish didn't have that level of \"Ma-la\" it should, but it was otherwise very flavorful and probably better this way. I just wanted to hold on to tradition because this dish was a favorite of mine and my uncle Chester's, who passed away a few years ago. It was a dish that made him laugh with pleasure when he would watch a little child swallow mouthfuls of such spicy food.The Tea Smoked Duck was mediocre but my mom explained that it's usually better.My favorite dish of the night was a Fish and Soft Tofu in Bean Sauce. It's the kind of dish Chinese people call \"Sha Fan\", a dish that accompanies rice well and usually encourages the eating of more rice. Logically, this pungent and saucy dish makes the cut.My dad loves this dish, traditionally made with the rice that is stuck to the edges of the pot. The rice is stuck together and fried and a saucy mixture is poured on top. This one had shrimp, mushrooms, and bamboo shoots. The shrimp was over-cooked but the flavor of the sauce was nice and light, a needed break from all the spicy dishes.I wasn't impressed with all the dishes. The spices were authentic but the level of heat was toned down a bit. I have mixed feelings about this restaurant because it was inconsistent but my mom said it's usually better and I trust her enough to go again.

Dub Cafe
CONTENT
After a haircut, I bee-lined towards the train station, but I caught a glimpse of a little place I never noticed, Dub Cafe? What does that mean, I thought? I was in a rush but I wanted to take a peak. This tiny place had a nice vibe and the chalkboard had some special on it that included coffee, food, and a mix tape? I ordered a coffee and I was delighted that the guy steamed the cream for me. That made it worth the $2.The place peaked my curiosity. I browsed the web and couldn't find anything on a Dub Cafe. I did find Dubspot, roughly in the same location, and it all made sense. So this is what the cafe of a DJ, VJ, and electronic music productions school would be like. Cool Beans...

Russo's Mozzarella & Pasta Corp.
CONTENT
I was walking home with my friend Angie and she told me about this tiny place called Russo's Mozzarella & Pasta Corp.Russo's Mozzarella & Pasta Corp. We would be walking passed it so why not stop in. They have a large selection of fresh pastas, raviolis, and some gnocci's. We decided to try the Roasted Butternut Squash Ravioli and a fresh pasta that looked like telephone cord.Not knowing what the ravioli would taste like, I decided to serve it with a lightly spiced chicken broth, peas, and cilantro. We liked that the raviolis had an abundant amount of filling. Unfortunately, even with such a light broth, the butternut squash filling was too bland. It was under-seasoned and lacked flavor.We enjoyed the telephone cord shaped pasta more, especially the shape. It's thick and chewy but lacks a bit of flavor as well. That was easily masked by the simple red meat sauce.Generally, we weren't that impressed with the quality but the fresh pasta is pretty inexpensive at $3 per 1 pound box. I would be willing to try a few more products before I ruled them out.

Jules Bistro
CONTENT
I went to Jules Bistro Jules Bistro many years ago and I can't remember at all what I ate. Today, I went for brunch at Jules Bistro and I'll probably forget about it soon too. So, I probably won't be back but I don't necessarily mean that you shouldn't go. Let me explain.There was nothing exciting on their menu to me. I can make anything they have pretty easily. It's very standard stuff. I also prefer to dine in better lighting. Brunch by candlelight is weird to me. None of the pictures came out since it was so dark. However, I do think it's a very good value for brunch, especially if you don't cook yourself. Steak & Eggs are $10.50 and everything tasted pretty good. The steak was cooked as I ordered, medium-rare. I liked how it was heavily seasoned; it worked well with the runny yolk. The fries were decent and the salad was good. They offer organic eggs at good prices and even sweeten the deal with live music. So, if you just want some safe standard brunch food, go to Jules Bistro, and try to get seating in the front where lighting is a bit better.

First Taste of the Dessert Truck
CONTENT
I know very little about the Dessert Truck since my first taste happened last night. My sweet friend Caroline, who also loves trying new foods, brought me Chocolate Bread Pudding. The description on their menu reads, \"our take on a classic chocolate custard dessert\". I enjoyed their interpretation, more of a custard/pudding on the bottom and bread pudding on top. I am very much a texture person and love getting more than one. Although the Chocolate Bread Pudding hasn't made my favorites list, it was good enough that it intrigued my interest. At $5 per dessert (tax already included), it was a generous portion so I wanted to know more. It seems that they have started offering specials and will take suggestions as well. I am very excited that they serve several items warm and the Bomboloni sounds like something I have to try!

Rice Krispy Treat Roll

Just on a whim, Lon and I decided to play around with dressing up Rice Krispy Treats. We used a standard recipe and just laid it in a pan in a thinner layer than normal. We whipped some peanut butter until it was fluffy and spread it on and then rolled it up.The rice krispy roll was then sliced and dipped in chocolate on one side. It was a bit messy but delicious!

East Ocean Palace - Banquet Stylin'
CONTENT
My family wanted to introduce Lon's family to Chinese banquet style dining. What better time than Chinese New Year. My mom made reservations for East Ocean Palace East Ocean Palace and everyone truly enjoyed it.Chinese banquets usually start with a cold appetizer platter. This one is probably the best I have ever seen. It was just huge and magnificent looking, perfect to start a celebratory meal. The sliced beef, fried pork, and jelly fish were very good, like top 3. The fried tofu and sliced duck were outrageously good and the platter was lined with nice pickled radishes and carrots as well.Walnut Shrimp is one of Lon's favorite dishes. It's giant shrimp fried and then covered in a mayonnaise sauce, sitting on a bed of broccoli and candied walnuts. Every part of this dish was superb. I had to convince myself not to eat too many so I could pace myself since this was the beginning of the meal.I don't know what this soup is called but it's got pieces of pork, lots of cilantro, and egg drop. It's a standard at most Cantonese restaurants but this one was a bit under-seasoned.The Squab served with shrimp chips were good. They were cooked nicely, showing off the crispy skin. I love that they served them with heads on!Lobster in Black Bean Sauce is a classic and favorite. The lobster was cooked perfectly and the sauce was so delicious I had to lick the shells.Beef with Chinese Broccoli is simple yet a crowd favorite. Chinese broccoli is one of my favorite vegetables and these were cooked perfectly.Fish is traditionally served whole and it's really important for the fish to be \"live killed\". This means that the fish did not die on it's own and was not frozen. Most reputable Chinese restaurants have large tanks to keep live fish. The fish are killed and cleaned right before they cook them. You can often pick the fish you want. This makes an incredible difference in the taste and texture of the fish. Wow, this fish was great!Crispy Skin Chicken (bone-in) covered in fried garlic. Lon calls it garlic candy. Congee Village Congee Village is the king of this dish but I'm not complaining about this one.Chinese banquet style meals often end with noodles and fried rice. These noodles were nice and chewy and did not include mushrooms (as they usually do) because Lon does not eat mushrooms. The fried rice was rather bland.Like many other Chinese restaurants, the ended with Red Bean Soup with Tapioca, a warm dessert soup that I like but Lon doesn't. There's was better than most. I was generally very happy with the food and service. The prices are reasonable and I would certainly dine here again. You can order these same dishes any time. It doesn't have to be Chinese New Year so, give it a try any time.

Chinese New Year's Eve Dinner at Mom's
CONTENT
Everything my mom makes is always amazing. So many people have begged my mom to open a restaurant but she never will. It remains a special treat for loved ones only. This year, she decided on some non-traditional dishes since we'll be having a big banquet style meal tonight as well.First, Fried Butterfish with Pickled RadishesThis cold dish of Surf Clam and Celery is light and refreshing. The hint of sesame oil is a nice accent.We saw this innovative dish last time we went to New Yeah Shanghai and my mom has a knack for taking restaurant creations and improving them. These Pork and Sticky Rice Wrapped in Bamboo Leaves looked better and tasted better.Yum, ox tail stewed in a rich tomato sauce. The picture is a bit smoky since I took the picture right as my mom plated it.These Fried Shrimp Balls were a hit. The coating is clever little cubes of bread making a light and crunchy outside.My mom makes an awesome Fish Head Soup. She uses a type of tofu, translated as frozen tofu. The process of freezing and then defrosting tofu cause the texture of the tofu to change and it becomes somewhat sponge-like, which allows it to soak up a lot more flavor. It's perfect for soups. New Year's Eve dinner must include dumplings. These were Way Fong brand Pork and Leek Dumplings (available at several Chinese markets). My mom and I regularly keep these in our freezer. Chinese meals usually end with fruit (here: strawberries, golden kiwi, green seedless grapes)

Valentine's Day Special
CONTENT
Valentine's Day is the second worst day of the year to go to a restaurant. The first worst being Mother's Day. There are tons of things you can do besides a restaurant for Valentine's Day. It'll show creativity and more effort than just making a reservation.1. Have a private chocolate & wine pairing for two. The easiest way is buying the Ghirardelli Intense Moments Gift Box. It comes with a wine pairing guide. If you want to put together your own matches, here are some guidelines and suggestions. My favorite pairing, discovered at a candy show in November, is the Cacao Reserve Milk Chocolate Truffle with a chilled Michael Mondavi Riesling.2. Get a heart-shaped cookie cutter and make any every day food more special. Heart-shaped peanut butter and jelly sandwich, heart-shaped grilled cheese, heart-shaped rice krispy treats?3. Make your place into your own private Japanese restaurant. Order from your favorite sushi place and display the sushi on sushi boards or boats. You can also buy chopsticks, little plates, and soy sauce/wasabi dishes and set up your own Japanese table. These serving sets are available at several Asian Markets. If you're in New York City, try Kam Man Kam Man. They have an entire floor downstairs with a lot to choose from. To top it off, you can get sake and sake serving-ware.4. Make your special someone a special tasting geared towards whatever they like. For me it would be a cheese tasting, but tasting can be done with so many other foods. How about olives, teas, or even potato chips?5. Of course, it is always impressive to make a whole dinner. Don't get too far ahead of your skill level. Very simple preparations can be impressive. If you're not a cook, focus on presentation. Get flowers for the table, nice napkins, and a table cloth. Feel free to buy dessert, just don't serve it in the box. Put it on a nice plate.We hope these recommendations entice your mate and make you seem like a sweetheart! These tips are equally applicable for both men and women. Let us know what you try and how it works out... Happy V-Day!

Celebrate Chinese New Year!
CONTENT
Chinese New Year celebrations start tomorrow night and lasts for days. Even if you're not Chinese, you can celebrate as well. Here's a brief outline. Pick and choose the things you'd like to do and modify as you wish. Hey, I celebrate Break Fast but I don't fast.1. New Year's Eve dinner is Wed night this year, on February 6th. Everyone scrambles home to be with their family, usually going to wherever their elders are. So, if you can, go have dinner with your parents and/or grandparents.2. The New Year's Eve meal is supposed to include a wide variety of dishes: a chicken, a duck, a fish, a meat (beef, lamb, or pork), and as many of each as possible. You can order in or make reservations at a restaurant to make things easy.3. Right before midnight on Wed night, eat dumplings. Dumplings are similar in shape to an old form of Chinese money or gold ingots called Yuan Bao and so dumplings are symbolic. You can also fold Yuan Bao shapes with paper.4. Make sure you have plenty of left-over fish from Wednesday night's dinner. The word fish in Chinese symbolizes abundance so you want to have plenty flowing into the next year.5. Starting on Thursday, New Year's Day, people start visiting everyone they know and eating with different people. This lasts for days, up to two weeks. Usually, you visit in order of how close people are to you and elders get priority, as always. I am clearly going to take advantage of this concept!6. If you're not into cooking, I've got an excuse for you. Traditionally, people will cook a lot of food and stock up for the days leading up to the new year. Once, it's Thurs, you don't cook anymore for days. It is considered a time of rest and celebration.

Gusto Grilled Organics
CONTENT
Gusto Grilled Organics Gusto Grilled Organics, no affiliation to Gusto Gusto (the Italian restaurant), is the first certified organic and certified green restaurant in New York. I am way excited! Unfortunately, the food is only mediocre but I'm looking forward to this trend growing and I really appreciate this first step that Gusto Grilled Organics is taking.Starting with the basket of bread, I was unimpressed. They were dry. We ordered the Tenderloin Pizza and the meat was over-cooked and under-seasoned. The dough (we chose whole wheat) was dry, crisp, and more like a cracker, with no flavor. Same goes for the crust on the Napolitana but I did like the flavor of the mozzarella, provolone, sauce, garlic, and parsley. We also ordered a side of average grilled vegetables and a Beef Empanada. The Empanada had a nice flavorful filling but the dough was a bit dry. Our waiter recommended the apple pie so we gave it a shot. It was a regular slice of Apple Pie but it was served with a very good Dulce De Leche Ice Cream. It was extra rich and really tasted like real dulce de leche.For the mediocre food, dinner prices are too high. If you want to support the concept, go for lunch, where items are 25%-60% less. (Prices were not on the website.) Also, the menu on the website, the menu on their board, the menu we got when we seated, and the menu I took on my way out were all a bit different so they seem to be still working out their kinks.I am really looking forward to more organic and green restaurants so I really hope Gusto Grilled Organics is able to make some improvements and do well.

Hi there, I work for GustOrganics.Thanks a lot for the criticisms! We are really new and trying to learn from guest’s feedback and improve every day.Our whole wheat pizza is just new and we’ve developed in rush because many guests have requested it in various occasions. Obviously we still have some way to go for sure.I think is fair to tell you that we are the first certified organic restaurant in New York and also Green Certified Restaurant.100% of the ingredients we use at the restaurant are USDA certified Organic.We cook our pizzas and empanadas in a grill not in an oven and we do it very fast because we believe is a lot healthier. (in general terms the least to cook the healthier the food is..)Feel free to give us another opportunity and if something is not right PLEASE let us know before you leave so we can make it up to you. We understand we are on soft opening but yours are not soft dollars…I honestly believe we are all used to pay very little for food and that is hurting us because due to this massive behavior is that organic food is much more expensive. It should not be that way..I don’t know about pizza Fusion but it looks like a great concept!If the community support what we and pizza fusion are doing most likely we will have more organic food / Green alternatives in the near future. I tend to like this idea rather a typical comparison that took us where we are now.I truly hope we can all cooperate towards supporting this kind of ventures developed by regular people dreaming for a better future rather than big companies trying to step in the green wave in order to make just big profits..All the best,Alberto

Salt by Mark Kurlansky

Salt was a New York Times Bestseller and Anthony Bourdain (who I respect) says \"...a must-have for any serious cook or foodie.\" I bought this book thinking that I was going to love it. Well, I hated it. Honestly, I've only read about a quarter of the book but I couldn't get through it. It's really a history book and as much as I love salt as an ingredient or seasoning, this book is just so boring if you're not into history. I'm giving it to my dad. BTW, for foodie reading, I loved Fast Food Nation by Eric Schlosser.

Flat Earth: Not Good.
CONTENT
In Duane Reade the other day, I noticed a stack of new snack products: Flat Earth. The bag is well designed and definitely hinted that the inner contents might be healthy, and after reviewing the ingredient list, the product is fairly healthy, albeit highly processed food, what can you expect from a Frito Lay brand?I snagged a bag of the Peach Mango Paradise flavor crisps. While I had no idea what to expect, I was hoping it would just be delicious, something like the Calbee Snapea Crisps, which are remarkably addicting and delicious. But alas, the Flat Earth crisps were anything but delicious. In fact, their logo (and website URL) is \"Impossibly Good\" -- I joked with Jessica and Janny that it would be impossible for anyone to think these were good.Jessica almost spit out the crisp she ate, thinking it was just horrible in flavor. Janny was not eager to comment on the flavor, I suspect not wanting to insult me for serving them... so she simply said they were crispy and would rather not eat more than the first one she tried. Unlike the ladies who gave up after just one, I tried at least 10 chips.Sure the flavor was somewhat medicinal, and the texture was heavily influenced by the visible coating of sugar on the top, but I kept wondering how anyone could produce such a failure of a product. Although, in fairness, the Florida's Natural Pocket Fruit Mix Bar I tried the other day was equally bad. Unlike the fruit mix bar, which I managed to eat in full, I could only find one permanent place for the Flat Earth chips... as shown below (hint: skip this product).

All of their fruit chips are disgusting!  My kids actually ran for the trash can to hack these things out.  But, the kids do like the sundried tomato veggie chips as well as the garlic something or others.

Knickerbocker Bar & Grill
CONTENT
Knickerbocker Bar & Grill Knickerbocker Bar & Grill was such a big let down. All three of us, Janny, Lon, and I, had heard good things about about the food here. When we walked in from the generic looking outside, I was pleasantly surprised by the cool piano bar atmosphere. You feel like you've left the NYU area and stepped into the 1970s. The build up then continued as we were seated on very comfortable banquettes and a basket of warm cornbread and fresh sesame bread appeared. The service here is excellent and portions are quite large but I must insist that the food is mediocre at best and certainly no place for a foodie.I can see why people like it here because I really wanted to. I was so impressed as several waiters patiently helped an elderly lady, dining by herself, with all of her needs. She needed steak to be cut, plates to be moved around the table, and sometimes just seemed to want to chat.We were all so excited about the menu. There were lots of non-standard items and we had such a hard time deciding what to order. I had already started planning my return visit so I could try other things. Boy was it a surprise that the food wasn't that good, starting with the crab cake. It was much more of a crab salad, heavy on the mayo, just formed into a patty and pan-fried on two sides. It was very salty but sat on a nice salad.The best of our three entrees was probably Lon's Veal Goulash. The veal was tender, flavorful, and covered in that same salad that was under the crab cake. The spaetzle however was horrid mushy stuff.Janny's dish was by far the worst, a Wild Boar Cassoulet that sounded fantastic on the menu but when it came, I just felt guilty that she was eating with us and had gotten a horrid dish. The wild boar was so incredibly dry and pretty inedible. She commented about how she felt like she was paying a lot of money for a plate of beans, since that's basically all that was tasty.My 14 oz Dry Aged Shell Steak was an issue because I ordered a medium rare and it came out medium. Knickerbocker is supposed to be a steak place so I expected it to come out right. I sent it back and they happily replaced it but this time, it was practically rare. You can see in the picture that it looks no more cooked than seared tuna. The red wine onions were quite good and I ate the practically rare steak. It was overly tendonous and did not seem to be dry aged. I will stick to real steak houses next time.Part of the reason I ordered the shell steak was because it came with Truffle Blue Cheese Fries. Such a good idea and I was so excited. Had I found a replacement for my lost Disco Fries? But alas, the fries were soggy and I didn't finish them. Not finishing fries for me says a lot.We had really wanted dessert before we started eating but after dinner, we weren't willing to give the desserts a try. We were just so disappointed with the meal. The food is moderately expensive and big portions don't make up for the lack in quality, but I guess others think so since they are packed.I think it speaks volumes that I had wanted to like this establishment so much. They have live music on certain nights and I had been planning to come for that too. Now, I may come and sit by the bar, but definitely will not eat here again.

Bee Pollen
CONTENT
Bee pollen (a.k.a. bee bread) is best defined as a miracle of nature. It has trace amounts of many different minerals and vitamins, it is relatively low calorie, high fiber, and high protein. We recently learned about it from our acupuncturist Pailin Winotaka and picked some up from Tremblay Apiaries' stand in Union Square Green Market (also available on their web site). We're glad we now know about this super food and you should too.Bee pollen is used in many cultures for medicinal purposes, both preventative and reactive. Some of the uses include improving energy, endurance, vitality, fertility, longevity, and recovery (including in cancer care); it is also used to correct imbalances such as weight issues and hormone regulation); and it is a natural antibiotic.It includes dozens of chemicals including melittin, adolapin, apmin, compound x, hyaluronidase, phospholipase A2, histamine, and mast cell degranulating protein (MSDP), dopamine, norepinephrine, seratonin, B-complex, folic acid, rutin, and lecithin (15% by volume). It is high in fiber (as cellulose), low-calorie (15 calories per teaspoon), high in protein (1.6 grams per teaspoon) and has natural fats. At the bottom of this post, I've listed many of the trace vitamins, minerals, enzymes, and other elements found in bee pollen. Learn a lot more about bee pollen on Shirley's Wellness Cafe.What It IsSo, by now you may be wondering how this super food looks, smells, and tastes. It smells wonderfully aromatic. The scent has a slight sweetness and is extremely floral. I definitely enjoyed the smell. The look is slightly less exciting, most closely resembling bird food pellets. Bee pollen comes in many colors typically ranging from deep orange to yellow to deep green. In a much less exciting arena is the taste... oy.The fellow who sold the product to Jessica said that people describe the taste in so many ways. My way is: dirt, lightly-honey accented dirt with an aftertaste of dust. Having no allergies, I shoved a big ole teaspoon in my mouth and chewed it up. The texture is something like dry egg yolk particulate that quickly melts into the pure flavor of ground up dirt, grass, and dust. Enjoyable is not a word I would associate with the experience (at least that's what I was thinking as I drank a huge glass of water afterwards to clear the bitter-ish aftertaste from my mouth).Jessica agrees that the texture is like a dry, crumbled egg yolk; but felt the flavor is something more of a bitter, citrus honey, which speaks volumes, since she has much more tolerance for bitter flavors than I do.TipsNutritional ContentsFor full information about Bee Pollen I highly recommend you check out the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations' page on bee pollen.Vitamins:Provitamin A (carotenoids), Vitamin B1 (thiamine), Vitamin B2 (riboflavin), Vitamin B3 (Niacin), Vitamin B5 (panothenic acid), Vitamin B6 (pyridoxine), Vitamin B12 (cyamoco balamin), Vitamin C (ascorbic acid), Vitamin D, Vitamin E, Vitamin H (biotin), Vitamin K, Choline, Inositol, Folic Acid, Pantothenic acid, Rutin, and Vitamin PP (nicotinicamide).Minerals:Calcium, Phosphorus, Iron, Copper, Potassium, Magnesium, Manganese, Silica, Sulphur, Sodium, Titanium-Zinc, Iodine-Chlorine, Boron-Molydbenum, Fatty Acids (Conifer Pollen)Enzymes & Co-enzymes:Disstase, Phosphatase, Amylase, Cataiase, Saccharase, Diaphorase, Pectase, Cozymase, Cytochrome systems, Lactic dehydrogenase, Succinic dehydrogenaseOthers:Caproic (C-6) - Caprylic (C-8), Capric (C-10) - Lauric (C-12), Myristic (C-14) - Palmitic (C-16), Palmitoleic (C-15), Uncowa - Stearic (C-18), Oleic (C-18), Linoleic (C-18), Arachidic (C-20) - Stearic (C-22), Limolenic (C-18), Eicosanoic (C-20), Brucic (C-22)

My BIG Peeve!
CONTENT
I hate when people rate and review recipes when they've changed some ingredients and/or some methods. Then, you are rating and reviewing a different recipe. I see it all the time. It comes up in conversation and I read it all over the web. For example, on allrecipes.com you'll see that someone rated a recipe 2 stars, which is low. When you read the review, it reads something like \"I used whole wheat instead of AP flour and I only used 1/2 cup milk (recipe called for 1 cup) because that's all I had left and it came out gross.\"Well frankly, you have no right to review the recipe since you've changed it. You didn't make that recipe. This is especially poignant for baking recipes. Slight changes can alter the effectiveness drastically. If you can't measure accurately, you've already messed up.Some people are notorious recipe changers. You never follow a recipe, ever. You know who you are. I have no problem with that. Just don't review a cookbook. Get it?I understand that sometimes, there is value. So, I do allow for some exceptions.1. This may not be fair but there are certain people who really understand cooking and baking. So when a professional chef says something to me like, I used dried cranberries instead of raisins or pecans instead of walnuts in a cookie recipe, I understand. Those changes do not change any baking properties but will alter flavor a bit. It is not the same as using pastry flour instead of bread flour to make bagels. So, that may piss some people off that I am allowing rights to some people and not to others but, I guess I'm saying that some people's comments are just more credible than others and when you make wild changes to recipes and then try to rate them, you've lost all credibility.2. It would be legitimate if you made the original recipe and rated it, then made changes the second time and you comment on changes that you think helped the recipe. For example, something like, rating the original recipe 4 stars and saying it was a bit too oily (and you followed the recipe exactly) and adding in the comments that you made it with x amount of oil the second time and you find that to be perfect.3. So this blog started because of a conversation I had with my friend Sara because she had posted on her Flickr page about a recipe/method. She made changes and I don't mind so much because in a posting on Flickr or a blog, it is an account of your own experiences. So, I think that it is ok when you're not rating or implying a rating of a recipe. I would disagree if she rated the recipe where the recipe was posted.So PLEASE, stop rating recipes that you have butchered!

Breyers Lactose-Free Vanilla Ice Cream
CONTENT
When I was young I consumed massive quantities of dairy. The shape or form didn't seem to matter. Downing bowls of ice creams, quarts of cottage cheese, pints of yogurt, or chocolate milk mixed with heavy cream were daily experiences. My mom used to buy a product called \"big moo\" -- it was five gallons of milk in a huge container with a spigot. I could easily get through that within the week. Heck, a friend once paid me to eat a stick of butter, and I enjoyed it (mostly). This infatuation with dairy got more refined as I aged, but not any less intense. Instead of gallons of ice cream, it was piles of cheeses. Living above a gourmet shop, the manager provided me with the pick of the cheeses as they arrived, the bluer the better.But some time in my early 20s stomach issues started developing, and eventually it became clear that I was... lactose intolerant. About this there is only one thing I can say: it sucks! For a while lactaid pills helped. But as my tolerance decreased, so did the benefit of the pills. Soy milks and other lactose-free products all seemed to taste terrible.Over a year ago, we discovered Odwalla's Soy Milk products. They taste wonderful, but are extremely difficult to find, no longer sold by Whole Foods or any of our local markets. Lately I settle on Westsoy, even though it's mediocre at best.As a surprise Jessica bought me a relatively new product, Breyer's Lactose-Free Vanilla Ice Cream. There is plenty of information on Breyer's incredibly cheesy-looking (no pun intended) web site. Basically, this is real ice cream consisting primarily of milk, sugar, and cream, that has had the lactose removed and lactase enzyme added, reducing the lactose levels to about 1% or less.Even though my lactose intolerance has gotten worse, I am still able to handle a bit of lactose. I have a feeling that those who are extremely sensitive couldn't handle this product. For the rest, definitely give it a shot. It tastes wonderful, just like normal ice cream.It's only available in vanilla, but that's fine, since you can add other flavors to it. For fun, I piled on some crunchy peanut butter and some homemade caramel sauce (left over from the banana cream pie). I'm so glad to see large companies helping out those of us who love dairy and suffer for it. Go Unilever / Breyers!Here's a list of some other lactose-free products.

I think you have to embrace non-dairy cooking and not look for substitutes.  I am not lactose intolerant, but my fiancee is, and it has just forced me to expand my cooking repertoire.  So i say, embrace all non-dairy items, cook only with olive oil, and kiss cheese goodbye.  It just forces you to be more creative, and the meals (after a while) taste better than they ever did -- I think of dairy as a quick and dirty means of making food taste good.  Having to do without it only improves your cooking.  I haven't missed dairy for at least 3 years now....

I don't think I could ever give up dairy. Every favorite food I can think of has cheese (exception being Asian foods)- pizza, grilled cheese, salads with blue cheese, cheese fries.... and most of the best desserts are dairy - cheesecake, tiramisu, banana pudding, ice cream, oh man, dairy is yummy.

I just tried a cup of Breyers Lactose-Free Vanilla yesterday and I cannot tolerate it at all! It said that it is 99% lactose-free-but I guess that the missing 1% is very important for some of us! Am I the only one who cannot eat this?

Elyse, so sorry it didn't work for you! I am not qualified to give medical advice but my first thought would be to try eating it with a lactaid pill?

Perilla
CONTENT
Perilla Perilla, an herb that is a member of the mint family, and the name Harold Dieterle chose for his restaurant, is a welcomed addition to the NYC restaurant scene. While winning the first season of Top Chef guaranteed tons of press and a stream of people lining up to try Perilla, I believe that Perilla has staying power because Harold truly has talent.I'm going to justify my opinion by adding that my friend and mentor, Carol Gelles, who dined with me and Lon, has been to Perilla twice before and loves it. She had dishes in mind that we had to try, the first being, the Spicy Duck Meatballs. They were rich, peppery, and delicious. To top it off, I loved the accompaniments (which was pretty much true with every dish), a raw quail egg and mint cavatelli. We also had a well-balanced Heirloom Red Lady Apple Salad with Maytag Blue Cheese, and a Sweetbreads Thai Salad, a special that our charming waiter described so well, Lon was enticed. Carol and I, both not big fans of sweetbreads, were so impressed. Delicious! The green papaya salad underneath went perfectly with the wonderful texture of each fried piece coated in rice flour.By now, I was already won over and just excited to try more. Carol ordered the Pancetta Wrapped Pork Tenderloin which was cooked the way most restaurants served pork tenderloin - medium. I prefer medium rare, but I was so impressed with the presentation. I don't know if you can tell from the picture how round each piece was, but wow, were those perfect circles.I was more interested in the appetizers so I ordered the Sardines as my entree. I also figured we ordered three appetizers, two sides, and would probably try dessert. I like that they plated the sardines in a larger dish so that it would look like an entree. We agreed that there was nothing exciting about the sardines, but the beets, salad, and sauces were fantastic.I think Lon's Jerk Style Black Grouper was my favorite dish. I'm not crazy about most white-fleshed fish, but this grouper had the best texture ever! I was also going nuts over the purple yams, plantains, and black bean puree. The whole dish just came together for me and I am definitely having this dish again. Lon was a bit upset that it didn't taste like \"Jerk\" and I agree, it needs a different name, but nothing else should change.The side of Broccoli Rabe with Oyster Sauce and Orange Confit was very good.Carol insisted we order (and we're glad she did) a side of Faro Risotto. I insist that you order it too. Harold calls it Risotto which does sound better, but when I ate it, I thought of mac & cheese, just way more elegant. It is absolutely delicious!! Another dish, I'll have to eat again.Before ordering desserts, Carol warned us that the desserts she had tried so far, weren't great. It was a while ago and the dessert menu looked a bit different so we took a leap of faith and tried freshly fried doughnuts (I order these any chance I can get), the Blood Orange Cheesecake, and Frozen Chocolate Mousse. We licked the plates clean, with the exception of some fruit on the cheesecake plate that weirded me out because it had some sesame oil on it. We raved and raved amongst ourselves until Carol pulled over a waitress and asked if the Pastry Chef had changed. Indeed! There has been some bad press about the dessert here so I want to let everyone know:THE PASTRY CHEF HAS CHANGED and now desserts are a must!I was very happy with my meal, which Lon and I discussed all the way home. It cost less than we expected, about $60 per person with tax and a generous tip. The portions were large and execution serves as a lesson. Perilla really uses some great ingredients and a great variety of ingredients. The menu is exciting and every dish feels as if Harold had a hand in it, which he probably did, since we found him in the kitchen. Bravo Harold!

We went to Perilla this past Sunday and it was delicious! Those duck meat balls were awesome! It was definitely my favorite appetizer. We also ordered the Lady Apple Salad and the Bison Tataki. The Faro Risotto... heavenly, especially since I'm a big mac n cheese fan! I had the special entree of the night which was a grilled skate in a mustard sauce with endives and calamari; it was a generous portion and tasted wonderful!

Ali Baba Turkish Cuisine
CONTENT
To celebrate Monica & Jae's birthday, a night of Turkish food and partying at Vig 27 was planned. Sarah (all the pictures here are courtesy of Sarah) picked the restaurant, and it was a great choice.From outside, Ali Baba Ali baba is unassuming, no more than 12 feet wide. When you walk in, it's a tight fit, and it seems like a small place. But as you walk back, the restaurants gets wider and the ceiling goes up, and then, if you're in a group, as we were (12 people), we went all the way to the enclosed garden, that had a large space heater. There were two other large groups in the garden with us.The employees at Ali Baba all seem to have an accent, which made communication a bit iffy at times, but mostly things works out. Such as ordering two large plates of the Mixed Appetizers. Each includes lebni, hummus, eggplant salad, ispanak eggplant, and pilaki. These were accompanied by absolutely delicious bread, sliced into strips, lightly topped with black sesame seeds. The ispanak eggplant (which had lots of sauteed onions and peppers) was the clear winner for everyone at our half of the table. The communication issues did create confusion when we ordered lahmacun, for which Ali Baba is well known. We tried to understand what the difference was in portion size between the large plate and the appetizer plate. Our waitress explained that the appetizer was the diameter of a drinking glass and the large plate was \"three pieces\". So for twelve, we asked if we need four of the large plate -- and the waitress sort of shrugged and said yes. We decided to just get three plates and then another hot appetizer of Arnavut Cigeri (fried liver cubes). It turned out that the \"pieces\" in the large plate were each about ten inches in diamater, and nine of them were way too much for appetizers. We took three and half pieces home!Everyone enjoyed the lahmacun, despite our ordering flaws and inability to pronounce the name. We topped them with the included flat leaf parsley, lemon, and other accoutrement. Our only complaint was that the pizza-like items were not hot enough. Temperature returned as an issue later, but let's come back to that topic. Separately, almost everyone enjoyed the liver; it was perfectly cooked and tasted wonderful with a sprinkling of lemon and seasoned, raw, red onions.After the appetizers were through, and a bottle or two of wine were inhaled, most people were feeling fairly full. So when the prodigal portions of entrees arrived we all breathed deeply and put our best foot forward.Sticking with their bread skills, I ordered the Donerli Pide, a thick dough crust, stuffed with lamb gyro meat and some red peppers and tomatoes. It was basically a Turkish calzone, sans cheese. It was oily, enormous, and very tasty. Jessica ordered the Mixed Grill, a vast plate of rice pilaf, charred pepper adana kebab, shish kebab, doner, and a lamb chop. The adana was wonderful, perfectly spiced and perfect texture. Most of the other meat was mediocre, particularly due to over-cooking. Everyone at the table shared plates, and most (except Jessica) eemed to think that the winner was either my pide or Sarah and Ran's ravioli-like dish, Manti, in a thick yogurt sauce.After the eating fest was drawing to a close, we somehow found room in our chest cavities to expand our lungs and bellow out a \"Happy Birthday\" song, which was louder thanks to the waiters and nearby tables joining in; and then room in our stomachs for the wonderful cake that Jessica made.Overall, the service at Ali Baba was good, the portions were very large (holy cow!, I mean lamb), and the prices were very reasonable. Add in the fact that there is the large space in the back yard and they don't charge a cake cutting fee, and this is a perfect restaurant for a party. With two people celebrating birthdays, ten of us split the bill for twelve people, including a couple of bottles of wine, a built in service charge, plus we added some more on for good service and it came out to $40 per person. Very fair.I recommend you catch the next flying carpet to Ali Baba and let us know what you think.For more great pictures of this event, check out Sarah's Flickr set.

Union Square Cafe
CONTENT
Believe it or not, I've never been to the famous Union Square Cafe Union Square Cafe. It's expensive, and at times very hard to get reservations, so somehow, it has slipped through, until today. My friend Lily and I made last minute plans for lunch there and it happens to be restaurant week (which I pay no attention to for dinner since I haven't been impressed the last few times). We had a very enjoyable lunch for a very good price so I'm sure to return to Union Square Cafe again, at least for lunch during restaurant week.The atmosphere is nothing fancy, just clean and comfortable, tables spaced apart nicely unlike most of NYC. The floors were slippery though and I almost fell twice. Three types of fresh bread, olives, and butter are presented at seating and water is delivered and refilled promptly. I was very happy with their 2008 restaurant week menu because there was four choices per course. I hate when there is only two choices for any of the courses and I've seen that often on restaurant week menus, which is one of the reasons I stopped going.For appetizers, Lily started with the Mushroom Bruschetta with Baby Mustard Greens and Goat Cheese. The flavors were nicely balanced and each ingredient was noticeably fresh. I selected the Crispy Eggplant \"Meatballs\" with Peperonata Vinaigrette and Ricotta. It was fantastic! Even Lily, who does not like eggplant, thought it was delicious. After finishing the eggplant-balls, I wiped the plate clean with bread. The oil used, the light cheese, and peperonata were so good! I could've eaten another plate.Since Lily had never eaten Arctic Char, our wonderful and informative waiter recommended she try it. It was nicely presented with crispy skin and a Citrus-Watercress Salad and Chopped Egg. The fish was cooked perfectly and showcased the wonderful texture of Arctic Char. They were also careful to use lighter accompaniments that would not overpower the subtle flavor of this fish. I could not resist the sound of Tender Braised Heritage Pork and Fennel Stew with Parmigian Polenta. It was exactly as it sounds, a great winter comfort food. The generous portion of pork stew was larger than I expected and the awesome polenta was super rich and buttery. I was so full and trying hard to finish it.I was a bit less impressed with our desserts. Lily's banana cheesecake had that fake banana taste and the crust was a bit salty. I liked the Rum Roasted Pineapple surrounding it because you could see and taste the vanilla bean but overall, didn't care for it. My Piemontese Hazelnut Cake had a hard texture and was very dense for cake. I loved the accompanying Gianduja ice cream but didn't even finish half the cake.I can tell that Union Square Cafe pays attention to their ingredients and the executions are mostly done well. Very nice presentations, the service is superb, and the location is ultra convenient. So today, I considered the $24.95 per person (pre-tax and tip), a great deal. Definitely try to visit them during lunch for restaurant week. They don't participate in dinner anyway.

I really love Union Square Cafe. Its just a great place to have a nice, comfortable, tasty meal with no fluff or gimmicks if that makes any sense. If you ever go for dinner the lamb chops were amazing and I don't like lamb at all.

Cranberry Bread Pudding
CONTENT
Last week, we had some guests over for dinner and Lon bought three baguettes, when we only needed one. This is common Lon behavior but of course, I had to figure out what to do with it. I decided to throw together a simple bread pudding and everyone seemed to love it (4 people finished about 75% of a 9×13 pan) so I'm posting the recipe, which was basically made based on what I had at home at the time.IngredientsInstructionsWe served it with caramel sauce and chocolate sauce since we had it left-over from the banana cream pie.

Reddi Wip... Good for Bob
CONTENT
We had dinner and dessert at Kasi and Stephen's tonight. For dessert we enjoyed a great bread pudding that Jessica made, using the many, many extra baguettes I bought, for some unknown reason (I do that from time to time). Kasi whipped out (sorry for the pun) some Reddi Wip. I couldn't help but notice some interesting writing on the canister.First of all, in a large blue swirl, just beneath the logo is the important factoid \"Made with Real Cream\". I can't help but be concerned about the state of food affairs when a whip cream manufacturer needs to advertiser that they actually use real cream in their product. I guess when you consider the fact that there are products like Cool Whip in the market, made of water, corn syrup and high fructose corn syrup, hydrogenated coconut and palm kernel oil , sodium caseinate, vanilla extract, xanthan and guar gums, polysorbate 60 (glycosperse), and beta carotene, without a damn drop of cream to be found [from Wikipedia], it starts to be important.We try to avoid processed foods as much as possible, so when I saw the line about \"real cream\" I had to jump all over it. Then we lightened the mood by all making fun of the marketing line on the back of the canister: \"Perfect for birthdays, baby-showers, & breakfast.\" Whoa! What brilliant business brain banged out this beauty? Boy, I'd boast if this blurb belonged to me.We realized that not only is this perfect for the events they named (is Reddi-Wip really that popular at baby-showers, that it gets listed ahead of breakfast and instead of \"dessert\"), it would also be good for \"boys, Bob, and boobs\". If you wanted to avoid \"B\"s, why not list it as good for \"Tuesdays\" and for \"Lunch\"? I wish I was in the room when they worked on this line. Although, from the wavyness of the line I have to assume they added in last minute, maybe by hand, during breakfast.

Birthday Cake for Monica and Jae
CONTENT
Whenever I'm baking a cake for a friend's birthday, the part that takes the longest is deciding what kind of cake to bake. After thinking about it for hours and then sleeping on it, then a few more hours of thought in the morning, I decided to make a White Velvet Cake with Classic Lemon Buttercream and a Raspberry Glaze. It was a nice light cake with subtle flavors, perfect after our very heavy meal.I used recipes from The Cake Bible for all three components: cake, filling/frosting, and glaze. I love Rose Levy Beranbaum's book because you can mix and match recipes from each section to make your own cake. She also gives recipes for full cakes. Although, I don't recommend this book for beginners, it is one of my favorite cookbooks, and great for when you're ready to take baking up a notch.

When worlds collide... As a technology professional, focused on the Internet, how could I not love the web site Open Source Food? If only for the name, it's a great idea, but the content is wonderful as well. OSF is a social networking site that is all about recipes that have pictures and are rated by the community.The site is not nearly as vast as AllRecipes, having only launched recently, and not having nearly as many users. But the users do seem to be loyal and active, similar in that Web 2.0-way to users of Yelp and in that Web 1.0-way to users of Chowhound.Originally, I heard about this site through a co-worker, Tim, who I believe is related or friends with the founders of OSF. Since you likely don't know Tim, I get the honor of letting you know. Go check out Open Source Food and let us know what you think.

Aja - Grand Opening
CONTENT
Aja Aja has opened a new restaurant in the West Village and since I ended up waiting for Lon at his office, way longer than expected, we decided to order dinner. We vaguely remembered enjoying a dinner we had at their original location Aja Asian Bistro and Loungeso it seemed like a good pick.We ordered a Sliced Chicken Hot & Sour Soup (since I'm still sick) that tasted like mild chicken broth with hot sauce. I kept thinking buffalo wings as I was drinking it but even more annoying was that there was very little stuff in the soup, almost like if you ladled some soup off the top of a pot without stirring. It was supposed to have silken tofu, diced tomatoes, mushroom, bean sprouts, vermicelli, and sliced chicken, but you really had to search for it. I think I found 3 bits of chicken, each the size of a pinky nail.They seemed to have an interesting list of Aja Special Rolls and I appreciated that several of the options were without avocado (not a big fan). We went for the Golden Dragon: spicy yellowtail, tuna, and cucumber roll with fresh mango and wasabi tobiko on top. I enjoyed it but it was a bit pricey at $12 and not much larger than a regular roll. With the soup and the \"special\" roll, we decided to share the Sushi and Sashimi for One since the description sounded like a large portion: 5 pcs sushi, 10 pcs sashimi, and a crunchy spicy salmon roll. For $28, I was a bit disappointed. The sashimi pieces were really small and nothing was cut professionally. The fish was fresh but not very flavorful (although I admit I have a cold). They did throw in a generous amount of edamame but we still felt that the food wasn't worth the price.I'm still hungry which is a sign that I'll never order from them again.

It already sucks enough when you have a cold. You can't smell, can't taste, and feel crappy. Trust me, I know since I'm sick again! But, I just read about a possible lawsuit against Cold-Eeze. It seems that the nasal spray form has left users with a loss or change in sense of smell and/or taste. Although nothing has been proven yet, my sense of taste and smell is so important to me that I'm not taking a chance. Further, I have taken the Cold-Eeze tablets before (like yesterday) and I do feel like they give me a funny feeling on my tongue. I always thought it was cause I was sick but I'm chucking it out now.

I love this ginger stuff (picture to the right) which is basically ginger sitting in honey. I couldn't find any online but it's available at most Asian markets in New York.Many people just dissolve a teaspoon or two in hot water for simple ginger tea but one of my favorite winter drinks is a hot cup of Ginger Milk Tea. Here's the basic recipe which you can adjust to your taste:2 teaspoons of that ginger stuff1 cup of boiling water1 teaspoon sugar1 teaspoon heavy cream1 tea bag (black tea)1. Place the ginger stuff in a mug and dissolve with hot water.2. Add sugar and heavy cream and stir.3. Dunk tea bag and remove tea bag depending on how bitter/strong you like your tea.It's so good; I'm about to make my third cup of the day.

Organic Shopping Cheat Sheet
CONTENT
Buying everything in organic versions can be really expensive or just hard to find. I have been hearing for a while now that organic is more important for certain items than others due to the amount of pesticides used and the amount certain produce will retain.The Environmental Working Group offers a guide showing pesticide load for 43 fruits and vegetables. So, if you can't afford to buy everything in organic, the idea is to try to buy the top ranking (most contaminated) foods in organic versions to avoid consuming the high amounts of pesticide.Aside from produce, you can avoid growth hormone and antibiotics by buying organic meat, poultry, dairy, and eggs.

Vegetarian Paradise 2

I'm not a vegetarian but every once in a while, I meet up with my vegetarian friend Emily for a meal, and to catch up. Today, we squeezed in a lunch in between her classes (she's an NYU Law student) at Vegetarian Paradise 2 Vegetarian Paradise 2 .Our waiter came over and asked if we were ready to order, Emily replied yes, and he jumped to another table. It was really weird. Then, we had trouble flagging him down to order for a while. Later, my hot and sour soup (average vegetarian version) came but Emily's spring rolls didn't. We asked about it, and the waiter said it was coming. Later, the spring rolls appeared on one of the main dishes. This was especially annoying because we expressed to him that we were sharing the main dishes.Anyways, the Tofu and Mixed Vegetables were pretty bland but I enjoyed the (fake) Chicken and Spinach in Curry Sauce. The vegetarian chicken wasn't great but I liked the flavor of the sauce.In all, this place has odd service and very average and predictable food. The formula works though, with their lunch special prices. I probably wouldn't select to come here again but for about $7 per person, I would go if someone else wanted me to go with them.

Emeril's Banana Cream Pie
CONTENT
My friend Angie has been raving about Emeril's Banana Cream Pie for a while. She had it in Florida years ago and has been hoping to have it again one day. For her birthday, I invited her over for dinner and surprised her with Emeril's Banana Cream Pie. She said, it tasted just like she remembers.All of us agree that it is a phenomenally delicious pie but there were a couple of issue with the recipe that I'd like to point out (notes are in red).Here's the recipe, from WCHSTV:IngredientsCaramel Drizzle Sauce (Ok, but we all agreed that it wasn't necessary) 1 cup granulated sugar 1/4 cup water 1 cup heavy cream Chocolate Sauce (Consistency was way too thick, totally not necessary) 1/4 cup half-and-half 1 tablespoon unsalted butter 1/2 pound semisweet chocolate chips 1/4 teaspoon pure vanilla extractChocolate Sauce (Consistency was way too thick, totally not necessary)Directions for the PieIn a mixing bowl, combine the egg yolks, cornstarch and 1 cup of the heavy cream. Whisk to blend well. Set aside. Combine the remaining 2 cups cream, 1 1/2 cups of the sugar, and the vanilla bean in a large heavy-bottom saucepan over medium heat, Whisk to dissolve the sugar and bring to a gentle boil, about 10 minutes.Slowly add the egg yolk mixture, whisking constantly until it thickens, about 5 minutes. Be forewarned: the mixture will break. Don't be alarmed! (The mixture should not break!!! )Pour it into a glass bowl. Press a piece of plastic wrap down over the surface of the mixture to prevent a skin from forming. Let cool completely at room temperature.When cooled, remove the vanilla bean and pour the mixture into the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a wire whip. Beat at medium-speed to combine the mixture. If it will not combine, warm another 1/2 cup heavy cream and slowly add it to the mixture. Whip until you have a thick and creamy custard. (Did not do this part since I did not break the custard!)Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. In a mixing bowl, combine the graham cracker crumbs, the remaining sugar and the mashed banana. Mix thoroughly. Add the butter and mix well. Press the mixture into a 9-inch pie pan. Bake until browned, about 25 minutes. Remove the pan from the oven and cool, for about 10 minutes.Directions for the Caramel Sauce (Again, not necessary)1. In a small, heavy-bottomed saucepan, combine the sugar and water and bring the mixture to a boil, stirring often. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the mixture is a deep caramel color and has the consistency of a thin syrup, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove from the heat. Stir in the cream, return the saucepan to the high heat and boil the sauce until it regains the consistency of a thick syrup, about 2 minutes. Cool.2. The sauce can be refrigerated until ready to use. Allow it to reach room temperature before drizzling it over the pie.Directions for the Chocolate Sauce (Again, forget it)1. Combine the half-and-half and butter in a small heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium heat. Heat the mixture until a thin paperlike skin appears on the top. Do not boil. Add the chocolate and vanilla and stir until the chocolate melts and the mixture is smooth.2. Remove from the heat and let cool.3. The sauce can be kept refrigerated for several days, but it must be returned to room temperature before serving.Assembling Directions1. To assemble, spread about 1/2 cup of the custard on the bottom of the crust. Arrange about a third of the banana slices, crowding them close together over the custard. Next, spread 1 cup of the custard over the bananas. Arrange another third of the banana slices close together over the custard. Top with 1 cup custard and the remaining banana slices. Top with the remaining custard, covering the bananas completely to prevent them from turning brown. (If you use recommended quantities, bananas and custard will start sliding off the pie and making a mess.)2. Cover with plastic wrap and chill for at least 4 hours.3. To serve, cut pie into wedges and drizzle on the caramel sauce and chocolate sauce. Top with the whipped cream and shaved chocolate. Sprinkle with confectioners sugar. (I thought it would look nicer if I put the sauce, whip cream, and shaved chocolate on top before slicing so that it would be served complete.)Yields: One 9-inch pie, 8 to 10 servingsIn summary, I recommend making this recipe in a pan with higher sides like a 9-inch springform or just use less custard and bananas. Or, better yet, just make it as a trifle! It would be absolutely perfect. Also, just forget the caramel and chocolate sauces. They don't add anything to the already delicious banana and real vanilla flavor.

I make this pie about twice a year for Easter and T-giving.I agree with everything you say regarding the recipe!  I do the same.For me it actually makes about two pies (using the ready made crusts).I'll have to try reducing the crumbs for the crust as I have not had success with it (for some reason it bubbles and rises).This is a huge family favorite!

On Drinking Wine
CONTENT
People seem to struggle when it comes time to selecting wine. My co-worker Marcos would insert a pun here, something like \"whine is not delicious.\" However, most agree that wine, without the 'h', is delicious. The question is, how do you pick the best wine?It seems odd that buying and picking wine makes so many people uncomfortable, but it shouldn't, it's really not that hard. So first, let's debunk a few myths and then consider a few basic tips.Myths to Ignore:Tips to Remember:\"There are no standards of taste in wine, cigars, poetry, prose, etc. Each man's own taste is the standard, and a majority vote cannot decide for him or in any slightest degree affect the supremacy of his own standard.\"- Mark Twain, 1895Drink what you like. The old rule was meat gets red and fish or poultry gets white. But that rule is long dead. There certainly are wines that tend to go better with certain dishes (here's a cheat sheet), but there are no hard rules. If you like the way a certain wine tastes with a certain food, go for it! Moreover, remember that modern etiquette is on your side, people should not tease you about choose the wine you enjoy.Have fun with wine, and let us know what you like drinking. Also, and this is most important here at FoodMayhem, cook with the wine you drink!

Lon has been there in the past and so have my parents, separately, and have all had good experiences in the past so I'm not sure if it was a fluke or decline in quality.

Amish Market to the Rescue
CONTENT
Our friend Justin through a great surprise brunch birthday party for his girlfriend Shayna. There was a great arrangement of bagels and spreads from Murray's Bagels, lox and belly salmon, a cheese platter(loved the Ubriaco), fruit, and crackers. The other table was filled with chips and dips and I made a big basket of assorted mini muffins, maple walnut, chocolate, and banana. (Yes, I just wanted to show off my basket of muffins)Everything was perfect but Something Sweet Something Sweet called Justin around 11am to tell him they couldn't deliver the cake he had ordered to be delivered at 12. That is so unreliable that it doesn't even matter if their cakes are good or not. We didn't think we could get another cake on such short notice but Amish Market Amish Market came to the rescue and delivered two beautiful cakes in about 15-20 minutes. Now, that is service!

This just in from Steve...Apparently there was a long standing tradition in the hallowed streets of New York City called \"Beefsteak\". Wikipedia briefly describes it as:Around 2000, Beacon Restaurant Beacon Restaurant reinstated the tradition; this year, Beacon's 8th Annual Beefsteak seems to be already sold out at a slight increase from the original price of $5 per person to a 2008 price of $175 per person, which includes tax, tip, and a $30 donation to Green Chimney's Children Services.There's lots more to read about via Beacon's informational Beefsteak PDF, here's an excerpt:

Black Napkins
CONTENT
At dinner tonight, Lily and Eugene told us a story about how recently in Orlando, their real estate broker became somewhat offended when, at Houston's, she was not offered a black linen napkin, and was rather given a white napkin. Our friends found this quite odd, especially when the next day, at another restaurant, the host made it a point to give Lily a black napkin.Knowing that Jessica and I are into food, they asked us about the phenomenon. We hadn't heard of it, but I guessed it had to do with the fact that often white napkins leave white lint on your clothing, which, in fact, happened to me just today at lunch at Markt!Thinking that it may be a Southern thing, perhaps with etiquette, I called my sister and brother-in-law because (a) they know tons of trivia; and (b) Stephen is from Texas. They hadn't heard of it.But by the time I got home, Kasi had done a bit of research and found some interesting discussion about this at Savory Tidbits. Here's an excerpt (go read the whole thing):I finally got it. OH! A black napkin so the lint from the white napkin doesn't get all over my black dress - \"No\" I said, \"Thank you, I'm ok.\" But then as soon as she left. I wanted the black napkin. I was curious about the black napkin. As she passed by our table, I leaned over and said, \"You know, I will take a black napkin.\"

I work for a linens manufacturer, and we find more and more upscale restaurants are interested in stocking black napkins. The funny thing is, if you have a high-quality cotton napkin, they won't pill on your clothing. It's when you have a lower-quality napkin (especially a blend of polyester and cotton) tha pilling/linting can occur. I guess it just makes people feel better though, knowing that if (by chance) the napkin does pill, the pills will blend into their dark clothing.

This just happened to my sister in Tunica, MS. She called from a nice restaurant to ask me what that was about? She was offered a black napkin, as she was wearing black slacks.  We could only guess the exact same thing as has been stated here. Glad to know our hunch was spot on! You have to love the internet to get answers for anything you need to know!

I refuse a black napkin for several reasons. As "Anonymous" wrote, a poor quality napkin has lint, a good quality one doesn't. When I see black napkins, I know that the restaurant is a sucker for spin and trend and sacrifices quality. Just wait for the day you have a touch of an oil based food that lands on your napkin and somewhere during the night, your napkin gets turned upside down and you are stuck with mysterious shacow your dry cleaners can't get out. What if the food you are eating has a brightly coloured spice like paprika and you go to wipe the corners of your mouth and you blot bright orange all over your face because you can't see the clean part of the napking because it's black. If the restaurant is being cheap with its napkins, what else is it cutting corners on?

Anonymous, you bring up a good point about not seeing possible stains on a black napkin. However, I don't think I would immediately assume a restaurant sacrifices quality just because they supply black napkins...it's possible customers just requested it if they don't know as much as you and other anonymous do about napkins....

A white napkin ontop of a black background, often gives the impression(in the case of men)that the patron is wearing an apron in other words you are sharing the table with the Maitre'D.

Basta Pasta
CONTENT
I've walked by Basta Pasta Basta Pasta for years and just written it off because of it's name. I thought it would be some generic pasta place that just pumps out large portions of mediocre pasta dishes. In the last year or so, different people have mentioned how much they love Basta Pasta and I'm glad I finally gave them a shot. It was anything but generic and probably one of my favorite places now.The food is Italian but the service is Japanese. From the moment you're greeted, you notice the attention to detail that the Japanese are known for. The open kitchen is immaculate and you can feel the pride of the staff.As I waited for Lon and friends to show, I munched on a yummy Parmesan bread stick twist as I watched the interesting table side service of a pasta dish. The spaghetti is tossed around in a hole dug into a giant Parmesan wheel before being plated. We didn't order this dish so I'll have to get it next time. Not complaining though since I loved everything we did order: 3 appetizers, 2 pastas, 2 meat dishes, and 2 desserts for the four of us: Lily, Eugene, Lon, and me.But before I get into that, the bread basket of three different breads were all wonderfully fresh, the olive oil was good, and we loved the interesting amuse bouche. It was a slice of bread with some kind of whipped blue cheese spread.Our starters included a Crab Tartar with Grapefruit Gelee (and beautifully dyed radish disks), Grilled Calamari Salad, and Pumpkin Gnocchi. Everything was cooked perfectly, plated beautifully, and interesting. The Pumpkin Gnocchi was my favorite and one of those dishes that will haunt me with cravings. I will be dreaming about the wonderful cheesy pieces that melt in your mouth. Mmm.....I was so happy with our appetizers that I didn't expect the entrees to keep up, but they did. First, our Bowtie Pasta with Salmon in a Mustard Grain Cream Sauce was delicious. It managed to be creamy yet light. And then, our Herbed Pappardelle with Oxtail came and topped the salmon bowtie dish. Next, perfectly cooked medium rare Berkshire Pork, the way all pork should strive to be. Plus it was served with a wonderfully thick, ginger-infused balsamic To end, delicious lamb chops. I was now in love, so of course we ordered desserts.We shared a Strawberry Millefoglie with a nice yogurt ice cream and a Crepe filled with cream and baked apple. Our yogurt ice cream had some paper in it and the wait staff was very embarrassed and quickly brought us a new plate of Strawberry Millefoglie even though we had eaten the whole pastry already. Both were nice desserts, not-too-sweet (the way I like it).I loved everything we ate and the service was great. I was expecting an expensive bill but for the amount of food we ordered, it really was very reasonable (about $45 per person if you include a 20% tip). I am really looking forward to coming back. It was a long menu and I have a lot more to try.

Pipa
CONTENT
Pipa Pipa is one of the four eateries in ABC Carpet and Home on Broadway. I've eaten there several times in the past and have found it a consistently enjoyable experience of Spanish fare.The decor includes heavy wood tables and chairs on the floor and many antiquated-looking, gaudy chandeliers (with price tags) on the ceiling. Oddly, with so many lights, the large room is always very dark, so much so that Loren and I struggled to read the menu with the flicker of our little table votive. We also struggled with what to order, since everything on the menu sounded delicious (it changes regularly, and the online version is not up-to-date)!We started with the Spanish Olives, a huge plate of Manzanilla, Arbequina, and Nicoise Olives. Then arrived our dish of perfectly sliced, slightly warm Chorizo. The slight heat allowed the smokey aroma of the paprika-spiced, cured sausage to rise to our noses. They tasted wonderful. Another minute or two later the waiter delivered a plate of Crispy Calamari -- the clear winner of the night! Most fried calamari is simple, battered, thickly-cut rings, that are often over-cooked. These were very thin rings, flash fried and covered in a rich, paprika and garlic aioli. The squid was some of the best I've had.After another minute the \"Baby Back Dates\" (as I believe they were titled) arrived. Each piece was a bite size date, wrapped in thick bacon, sitting in a mustardy sauce on an endive leaf. I ate them all! About the same time our Crab & Shrimp Croquettes showed up. Three golf-ball sized morsels filled with incredibly fresh crab. I didn't taste the shrimp, so I assume it was ground fairly fine and made the filling of the ball. They sat in a smooth, horseradish aioli, that lacked the \"bite\" that one would expect.For the last and largest tapa, we selected the Bisteca Coca, a delicious, lean tenderloin with tomato and a light sauce on Catalan flat bread. The bread was not strongly flavored, but the steak was; it tasted good and was only a bit difficult to eat (as the coca mostly fell apart).I give Pipa a thumbs up for decent, consistent food. I can't stand how noisy it gets in there, or how dark it is, but the food is very enjoyable, and rarely do you need to wait on a line. Check it out some time.

Baking Supplies with Bad Service
CONTENT
I walked into New York Cake Supplies New York Cake Supplies yesterday since I was in the area. As I neared the back, I hear two customers on line (who did not know each other) start talking about how bad the service is at this store. Apparently they had been standing there for a while as the owner, sitting behind the register, just sat there casually having a conversation on the phone. The two women went on describing different bad experiences they had at the store, mostly about the owners terrible attitude. They both agreed that they would not come here if there was any other store they could go to but he does almost have a monopoly. I thought about it and it's true. There are stores like Broadway Panhandler and Williams Sonoma, with way better service, but they're not really baking stores. They are cooking stores with some baking stuff but not nearly as much as New York Cake Supplies. This allows them to keep up expensive prices too. Meanwhile, the store looks pretty old and crappy. As the first women pays, she asks about the serving size of the pan she chose and he tells her to read the label. That was helpful....As I continue walking around day dreaming about having every one of these baking pans, I over hear a customer ask for a product that he can't locate. The owner just says, \"It's there.\" The guy had already been shuffling through the shelf for a while and clearly could not find it. A few minutes later, there are no more customers on the line and so the owner starts shouting into the store, \"Next.....Next.\" How obnoxious?Somebody, please open another baking store.

Buying Beigel's Challah from BJ's BJ's is the best bang-for-your-buck Challah. The 30 oz package that has 2 braided loaves is $3.79 when just 1 loaf often costs $4.50 to $6.50. It's a darn good challah too. Fluffy, yet chewy, with that beautiful golden sheen, fit to serve. I ate half a loaf as a snack last night around 11pm. I couldn't stop. I had some more today expecting it to taste a day old but it tastes exactly the same as it did yesterday. Love it!

Ivo & Lulu
CONTENT
I really wanted to like Ivo & Lulu Ivo & Lulu. They had great reviews and low prices, especially for organic produce and free range game. I tried so hard to like this far, out-of-the-way spot, but by the end of the night, I couldn't, and the other three girls didn't seem interested in coming back either.The Smoked Mussels appetizer was an exceptionally ugly dish, but still my favorite since it was the only dish that was well....pretty good. (I don't want to comment on the Grilled Avocado Stuffed with Spinach Mousse since avocado is one of the few things I do not enjoy eating.) Unfortunately, the rest of the meal ranged from poor execution to mediocre. I chose the Duck Breast which was completely cold and very tough, served with flavorless cous cous. There was a generous sprinkling of whole peppercorns on the slices of duck breast which I did not notice initially in the dimly lit room. So when I took my first bite, it was an unpleasant surprise for my teeth. Hilary ordered a Smoked Chicken that was sliced and covered in too much of a very sweet, creamy sauce. Her meat was also dry and over-cooked. Nicole ordered the Jerk Duck Leg which had a decent flavor, probably the best of the four entrees, but nothing to write home about. Tracy's dish was the most attractive, served in a hollowed out squash. The mediocre vegetable soup (heavy on the coconut milk) was hardly enough to call an entree and I was worried that Tracy didn't have enough to eat.On top of my total disappointment in the food, I was so unhappy throughout the meal as I froze to death sitting by the door that was always left open. Nicole even got up to close it once but it was opened again a minute or two later. The restaurant is set up as two shops that are not directly next door to each other. Since there is something in between and the kitchen is only on one side, the wait staff goes in and out of the two spaces leaving the doors open. This would explain the cold food, I guess.Again, I am so disappointed at the inaccuracy of reviews and that the place remains quite busy. I understand that it's very cheap ($14 for duck breast) but is it worth it to get good ingredients so poorly prepared? I will never go back.

Lady Mendl's Tea Salon
CONTENT
We held Angie's surprise birthday party at Lady Mendl's Tea Salon Lady Mendl's Tea Salon where the focus seems to be atmosphere and service more than food. They took care to accommodate the surprise and gave us a seat for one friend who would not be eating since she was ill and served her tea without charging extra. Tea was always poured for you and the decor was pretty Victorian style rooms with fresh flowers and dim lighting. Yet, food was really mediocre at best in taste and presentation.The first course was a simple salad of greens, cherry tomatoes, and a niblet of corn here and there. It was dressed in oil with a hint of vinegar. Maybe someone forgot to shake the jar? The next course was finger sandwiches. The curry chicken and goat cheese were on a multi-grain that was hard from being left out in open air too long. The cucumber sandwich had no flavor. I like the smoked salmon and the cranberry, smoked turkey, but they weren't special. After serving you one of each sandwich, they come around a second time to ask if you want seconds of any. The next round is a plain scone and a cranberry raisin scone served with clotted cream and raspberry preserves. All of that course was mediocre and the two little scones look pretty sad on a big plate. For dessert, you get a choice between a chocolate mousse cake or a vanilla cake with pastry layers. Both of those were pretty good but the last course was also dessert, which seemed redundant. A plate a petits fours (that were old), cookies, and chocolate covered strawberries are placed on the table to share.For a group our size (eight), we were given a choice of four teas to share. I don't remember the names of the teas but we chose one black tea, one oolong, a Jasmine green tea, and something with lavender (that I didn't try because I hate lavender). The teas were very good but I would've like the black tea to be served hotter. They were all served at or around the steeping temperature of green tea.I had a lovely time and it's a fun concept for girls but since I'm a foodie, I probably won't go again. If I were them, I would ditch the salad course and last dessert plate and just work on improving the food for the three courses.

My childhood best friend, Yumiko, brought two kinds of candy from Japan for us. I love the Matcha Candy. It has the distinct flavor of Matcha Green Tea without being as sweet as American candy.The other candy (pack on the left) is really more for aesthetics. Can you see the detail of the little mice in the pink candy(peppermint flavored)? It's the year of the mouse/rat and the yellow candy has \"2008″ on it. The brown pieces (butterscotch flavored) have the Chinese symbol for \"child\" on it symbolizing that this is a New Year candy. It's really amazing how they can make candy with such detail.

Vanessa's Dumplings
CONTENT
I've mentioned Vanessa's Dumplings Vanessa's Dumplings before but I thought I'd give a more thorough review this time. We've ordered from Vanessa's Dumplings a couple of times and my evaluation is that they make certain things well and there are other items to stay away from. I'd steer away from seafood dumplings because they weren't so fresh but pork and chive dumplings are good, especially for the area. Their wontons are the best I've found that will deliver to us. I can't stand the over-sized wontons with doughy skins that are common outside of Chinatown. Yuck! But when ordering wontons, get the Shrimp, Pork and Watercress Wonton Soup because the soup and noodles in the Wonton Noodle Soup are kind of bland. The Sesame Pancake Sandwiches are pretty good and a really good value at under $3 each. The Beef Noodle Soup is an ok and cheap order also. Lon ordered a Spicy Tuna Roll with Shrimp and Avocado on top. While it's definitely not real sushi, it was a nice sized portion and fresh. I'm pickier about sushi than Lon is so I would just stick to ordering the wontons, pork and chive dumplings, and the sesame pancake sandwiches.

Calling All Chocolate Lovers!
CONTENT
I had to share this recipe for a triple layered chocolate cake. Lon says it's the best chocolate cake I've ever made and I agree. My guests loved it and my friend Monica took some home to her parents and they loved it too. Many thanks to Sandy who posted this recipe!! I foresee using this as a birthday cake many many times.I did lower the amount of sugar in the frosting to 3 3/4 cups confectioner's sugar (which is one standard box) because I always do. Most frostings are too sweet for me and this adjustment was perfect. Trust me; it was still very sweet. I also recommend using Pam non-stick spray on the cake pans which lets the cakes out perfectly.Besides the fact that this cake has great flavor and an amazingly moist texture, I just love that each cake comes out so level so you don't have to cut and level the cake. There's no loose crumbs either, which makes it super easy to frost and you won't need a crumb layer.

Russian Chinese Oxtail Soup
CONTENT
Fusion food is so popular these days and yet I haven't seen any restaurant with Russian Chinese food. I know it exists too because a close family friend, that I call Grandma Olia, grew up on the border of China and Russia. She speaks Russian, Chinese, and English fluently.Grandma Olia is a second mother to my mom, and she taught her how to make this Russian Chinese Oxtail Soup. I enjoyed this soup frequently as a child and when I got sick this weekend, my mom brought over a whole pot of it. She knew it would make me feel better.Sadly, my mother doesn't have written recipes for anything, but this rustic soup is simple: oxtail, onions, carrots, celery, cabbage, canned beets, and a bit of canned tomatoes.

When Second  Chances Pay Off
CONTENT
Quite a while back (perhaps over five years ago) I visited Salam Restaurant Salam Restaurant with some co-workers. The food can best be described as \"Arabic\" because the menu walks around the Middle Eastern region, looking for a home. There is Turkish, Moroccan, and Syrian dishes (plus others). We went for the basics: a few appetizers, grilled meats, and drinks. I left being wholly unimpressed, writing off the place as over-priced, average food with slow service. Fast forward from then to about a year ago, when Jessica started telling about a great restaurant with hearty food, perfect for winter. So last night when Jessica's close, childhood friend, Yumiko, was in town, we decided to check out the place. So off to Salam we went, and I was surprised when I realized it was the same place I had written off so many years ago.We sat in the back of the restaurant and started with some babaganonouj (baba ghanoush), warm pita (not freshly made), and some crisp bread (manakish) liberally coated with za'atar (a lemony mix of herbs and spices). While the manakish was very tasty, the baba ghanoush was very acidic, even for Jessica (who enjoys more acidic foods than I do), and the pita as warm but not homemade. Fortunately, we also ordered the kibbee (kibbeh) and it was excellent. Nevertheless, as we patiently waited for our entrees, I started thinking, \"oh great, just as I remembered.\"Then the entrees arrived, and things completely turned around. We ordered three dishes for the three of us to share. The chicken-filled Ouzi (phyllo dough stuffed with rice, minced meat, raisins, yogurt, and lots of spices) and lamb macloubee (tender lamb simmered with tomato sauce and layered with eggplant and rice, cooked in a pot and then turned out onto a plate) arrived first, both were enormous portions. We couldn't hold back, and the three of us rushed the dishes. Each was better than the previous.The ouzi was sensational! I couldn't stop eating it. It was a great blend of spices, creamy inside, with a bit of rice and minced chicken, and crispy on the outside. It was savory and a bit sweet (because of the raisins).The macloubee was another winner. The lamb was so tender, flaking apart, while the eggplant was not oily and still firm. The rice was perfectly cooked with just enough tomato sauce to pull the dish together, but not so much that it would be stew-like.After a few more minutes, the Salmon Curry showed up. While I have to admit that the salmon was slightly overcooked, it tasted outstanding with the creamy sauce on top. I would not describe this dish as curry to any one else, as curry typically implies the abundant use of strong spices, typically found in East Asian cuisines (like Indian), and is not really a term used in Middle Eastern cooking. This dish was far more subtle, but flavorful. The plate was dressed with nicely cooked spinach, which included some type of pickled vegetable (we think), which none of us could identify.The prices turned out to be very reasonable. The three of us were absolutely stuffed, and there was more than enough food for an entire additional meal (that still tasted good today). This is definitely a case where I'm thrilled I gave a restaurant a second chance; perhaps time improved the place, or the different dishes made the difference. Either way, I recommend you give Salam a first chance.

Love Rivals Mud?
CONTENT
I've been seeing this new coffee truck lately, on the corner of 14th Street and Fifth Avenue. It looks like a knock-off of The Mud Truck, using similar colors, but it has a LOVE logo. According to some minimal online research, it's due to a split between the founders of Mud, so it's supposed to be the same coffee.I tried the regular coffee twice wanting desperately to like it because Mud was supposed to be good coffee (never tried it) and it's on my corner; but alas, the coffee tastes a bit burnt. Other than that, the prices are good and so is the service. A regular coffee costs $1 and they don't charge extra for steamed milk. The guy is friendly, fast, and serves with a smile.*side note: Starbucks coffee tastes burnt too and it's doing well also. Do New Yorkers just like burnt coffee? I'm disappointed people!!

New Yeah Shanghai
CONTENT
We've blogged about New Yeah Shanghai New Yeah Shanghai Deluxe before, so I'll try to keep this one short and sweet, just wanted to share some pics this time.Their strong suit is really dumplings skins. The fresh handmade dough is perfectly chewy, not too thin and not too thick. We had Soup Dumplings (above, to the left), Pork and Chive Dumplings, and Vegetable Dumplings (right). I loved all three.Another dish we always order is the Crab, Sauteed with Minced Pork, Soy Beans, and Rice Cakes (shown left). This time the rice cakes were incredible.Fish Head Soup (shown right) is one of my favorite Shanghainese dishes.The flavor of the soup was rich, as it should be, and the tofu and mung bean noodle sheets are standard necessary ingredients. The size of the fish head was a bit smaller than what we've had at other restaurants though.My mother noticed a new dish posted on their board. Pork (with bone) wrapped in some sticky rice, then wrapped in bamboo leaves and steamed. I thought it was a wonderful twist on a traditional food called Dzong Dtz (which is kind of like a Chinese Tamale made with sticky rice).Ok, so the post wasn't that short but one more thing: we took a video of the Sizzling Beef and Scallop dish so you could see the sizzling.

I like this restaurant.  Whenever I want Shanghainese food, I always go to New Yeah Shanghai.  I tried the Pork and Chive Dumpling you suggested recently.  The filling was definitely tasty, but I found the dumpling skin to be a bit thick.  It was nice and chewy, but just too much of it.  My favorite dish at this place is the Fish Head Soup you mentioned.  Delicious. Nice and light and love the clear noodle that they included in the dish.

Pizzeria Uno Closed, Welcome The Smith

It seemed like Pizzeria Uno, on Third Avenue and 10th, had been there forever and would remain, even though, honestly, it was filthy. Well, we drove up Third Avenue this evening on our way back from Chinatown and I noticed that \"The Smith\" The Smith has replaced Uno. The menu (available on Eater as a PDF) looks a bit like a haphazard attempt at newish American bistro. The decor looks interesting, but until we stop by for dinner, we'll have to reserve opinion.

Dirty, bad service, heinous food. I know I grew up a lot in my tastes, so that accounted for some of the discrepancy between past memory and present reality, but I think this particular instance was especially bad.Good riddance.

Jacques TorresWe're now half way through the box of assorted chocolates and are surprised to find that we're not impressed. The chocolates aren't bad, just not that good either, and definitely not worth $55 per box. We're also surprised at the lack of attention to detail. Several of the chocolates don't even match the pictures with the name and description. Either designs have blurred or just faded.While I wouldn't recommend this product, I still recommend checking out one of his stores. Lots of the stuff is really good.

Cheryl & Matt bought Kasi and Stephen some \"Chocolate Chunk Brownies\" from Dancing Deer Baking Co. Holy cow (err, deer) they're delicious!I'm not the biggest brownie fan, and find most fancy shmancy brands (like Fat Witch) passable at best. But I really enjoyed the bite of these brownies. They are very rich, but not too rich. The texture is perfectly dense with slight cakiness, with a few chunks of chocolate scattered about. And the flavor is just excellent.Jessica found the brownies mediocre, tasting too sweet and too fudge-like for her. This is where we disagree. I vote these as some of the best I've had (at least in recent memory). But looking at the purchase price of $19.50 for eight (plus shipping), I'm a bit stunned. I think I'll stick with homemade.

Beautiful Food
CONTENT
All of our senses come into play with food. When we cook we feel the texture and doneness of food with our hands. We use careful pressure to ensure that meatballs are pressed tightly enough and that dough is worked enough. As food cooks we listen carefully for key indicators, the sizzle of protein in a hot pan caramelizing or slowing sound of frying oil. We taste as we cook, ensuring seasoning and overall flavor. And, we smell every step of the process -- who doesn't enjoy a house that has the rich aromas of dinner and dessert? But of all the senses, the eye is most important as the food transitions from the kitchen to the dining room.Chefs do all they can in the last moments to make food beautiful. Garnishes, plate selection, food layout, even the dining setting all matter. One great name for the entire visual experience is \"eating architecture\", and there's an interesting book by the same name (here's more about the book). Then, it's the eyes of the diner that take over. Does it look good? If it looks good there's almost an automatic assumption that it will taste good. What color is it? Our brains alter the perception of taste based on color, for instance, we often assume yellow foods taste sweet (read more about color impact in Jeannine Delwiche's paper on food perception - pdf). Food color has been recognized as important since around the 1300s.Since you're reading this food blog, you likely enjoy looking as food as much as we do. I literally just browse around the blogosphere looking at food pictures and reading about them. And for fun, I like to monitor which of the hundreds of food or cooking-related photos we've posted to Flickr is most \"interesting\" (Flickr tells me); and by the way, it's the cookie image you see on the right! In the past, I've mentioned blogs that are particularly attractive (like the one about cupcakes). There are many others you may be interested in, some focused on photography and some focused on food, and some that seem to walk the line perfectly, like one of my favorites: La Tartine Gourmande. Another great site for beautiful food is TasteSpotting. If you haven't already browsed their best of 2007, you should!If there are other beautiful food sites you think we would enjoy, let us know.

Chestnuts, the Low Fat Nut
CONTENT
My mom knew I was sad about not having chestnuts on Christmas Day so she brought me a huge bag of chestnuts last night. I cringed. I'm supposed to be on a diet now that the holidays are over and I have less than five months to my wedding. Plus, Lon doesn't eat chestnuts.Of course, I started eating some chestnuts last night after my family left. I tried the microwave method and did not like it. So last night I soaked some over night and now I'm boiling a batch (about 50 minutes depending on size). This is my favorite method because if you soak them, you don't have to cut a slit open, which keeps flavor locked in. If you don't have that much time, here are some other cooking methods.I decided to look up the chestnut nutrition facts to see how much damage I was doing. I always thought chestnuts were super high in fat but I just looked it up and they're actually pretty low in fat (1.6 grams in 4 ounces of cooked chestnut) compared to other nuts. Yay! They are still high in carbohydrates so I can't have an all out chestnut fest but you should probably think of them as being more like eating sweet potatoes than walnuts.

Can I Re-write Your Menu?
CONTENT
I had my family over for T-bone Steaks and sides and a Crustless Cranberry Pie for dessert. The recipe called it a pie but it's not really a pie since the definition of pie includes a crust or shell. It's one of my little peeves when foods are named incorrectly because the name sets expectations and part of the enjoyment of food comes from the meeting or exceeding of expectations. It's baked in a pie dish but the texture is more brownie-like. To be fare, this one is a little harder but I think something like, Cranberry Blondie would be more accurate. As for ratings, it was a hit with my brother and my dad but bombed with my mom and Lon. I was in the middle. It's definitely for someone who likes very tart flavors.

Rice Krispy Treats for Adults
CONTENT
These Chocolate Peanut Butter Rice Krispy Treats were a hit. I didn't write down an exact recipe but here's the gist. It's super easy.Make one standard recipe of Rice Krispy Treats and press it in to a 9×13 pan, sprayed with non-stick spray. I like to use wax paper sprayed with non-stick to help me press in the sticky treat evenly. Let it cool for a few minutes. Then, I spread a thin layer of peanut butter (microwave it to make it more spreadable) and let it cool again. Then make another batch of standard recipe Rice Krispy Treats and press on top. Let it cool for a few hours.Turn out onto a board or clean surface. The treats should come out of the pan very easily. Melt chocolate (I used Ghirardelli Dark Chocolate) over a double boiler and drizzle on top of the Rice Krispy Treats. Let it cool until chocolate solidifies. Cut into square or shapes and serve.Notice that there is no additional sugar added to the peanut butter and the chocolate I used was less sweet. That gives the Rice Krispy Treat a nice balance for adults while still being able to indulge in childhood favorites.

Mishima Mishima is a good neighborhood sushi staple if you live in the neighborhood. They have fresh fish for reasonable prices and a clean atmosphere. Everyone was pleased with the appetizers, one of nicely cooked grilled squid, and one of spicy scallop tartar. My sushi sashimi combo came in a generous portion although one or two pieces were a bit tendonous. In the end, there's nothing special enough to travel for but I would probably go occasionally if I lived nearby.

Rosa Mexicano

Aside from being over-priced, Rosa Mexicano Rosa Mexicano was a pretty good choice for lunch. I wanted to take a bunch of my cousins from out-of-town to a lunch near my apartment so we could hang out and play games at my place afterwards. And, one of my young cousins, Christopher, is a skinny Chinese boy who hates Chinese food and prefers Mexican. Weird huh?So, we got the guacamole, famous for being served table side. I don't like avocado so I can't really comment but it was served with two salsas that I did like. Three people (Lon, my brother, and Jonathon) ordered the Arrachera con Camerones (Grilled Skirt Steak with Jumbo Shrimp Stewed in a Roasted Tomato-Chipotle Sauce and topped with Queso Fresco) and it was very good. Everyone tried to sop up the extra sauce with rice. I ordered Cabrito Tacos (Baby Goat) which was good and came with a great corn esquite and bean chili. Jeffrey seemed to enjoy his Pelona (Pulled Short Rib Sandwich). Christopher didn't really like his Quesadilla but he pretty much hates food (I know! Not related to me right?) and Olivia's Pescado Taco (Grilled White Fish) had no flavor. The fish also had too much char on it. I didn't like their soft tortillas much either .The place is nice and festive looking and the service was good so I'm glad we went once and had a good time. The presentation of dishes was very attractive but I still think their prices are too high, especially for lunch.

Restaurant Spree
CONTENT
Since the Friday before Christmas, we've noticed that restaurants (in NYC) have been really empty. Even places that are normally packed look less crowded; you could easily walk in without reservations. I'm going to have to remember to take further advantage next year and go on a restaurant spree around this time of year.

I totally agree - the landscape has been more sparse than in other years.  I have a site called http://www.ElleEatist.com and we do restuarant reviews of places that single affluent women would like to go to -- and tell them the best nights to go as well.  Want to trade links?  Happy New Year! Susan

Grimaldi's
CONTENT
Grimaldi's Grimaldi's is known by many as the best pizza in NY. It's another one of those places that I've been planning to go to forever but haven't been motivated enough. First, it's outside of Manhattan. Second, the long line is almost more famous than their pizza. And, what if the pizza wasn't really that good? So many \"best\" places have disappointed me and I have little faith in popular opinion.I am happy to say that Grimaldi's was worth it. The pizza is fantastic! We ordered two large pies for four people and had no problem finishing it. The crust, sauce, and cheese are all the flavors and textures they should be, in the right proportions from each other. For toppings, we ordered one with mushrooms and garlic, the other with roasted peppers, onions, and pepperoni. The garlic is extraordinary and I highly recommend it with any other toppings you may like. My only complaint is that the amazing pizza tastes substantially less amazing once it cools and it cools very quickly due to the low amounts of oil and how thin it is. I wouldn't want them to change a thing about the pizza though. You just have to eat quickly and maybe order one pie at a time.When the pizza is piping hot, Grimaldi's is possibly the best in NY. It's hard to say for sure though since my other favorite, Numero 28, has a very different but equally good pizza.

Soba Totto
CONTENT
Soba Totto Soba Totto, the new sister restaurant to the popular Yakitori Totto Yakitori Totto, just opened Christmas day. We went the next evening, while the smell of fresh paint still lingered and the wait staff seemed nervous.I'm not going to spend too much time on this blog since the restaurant was neither impressive, nor disappointing. I do have a few notes though.1.The soba, part of their name sake, did not look or taste like soba. It tasted and looked more like thin spaghetti.2. Never order \"grated yam with egg\" in a hot soba unless you know what it is and sure you like it. The \"grated yam\" they are referring to is not the yam that we sometimes confuse with sweet potato. The grated yam has a texture like water chestnut and sits in a pool of raw egg white like substance. The slimy mixture is supposed to be mixed in to the soba broth which thickens it a bit but does not add any flavor. Now that I have made that mistake, I hope you don't have to.3. They have chicken oysters on their yakitori menu which is a nice touch.

Norma's at Le Parker Meridien
CONTENT
Ahh...Norma's Norma's, the famous breakfast place. I think it's been hyped up so much that it couldn't have met my expectations. It seemed like the perfect place to go during the holiday season. It was almost a touristy thing to do but since I went to see the tree at Rockefeller Center yesterday, I guess I'm in the mood this year.Sara had been to Norma's already so she warned us of big portions. We decided to share two dishes and a smoothie between three people but The Full Monty Cristo and The Seafood Schooner Salad didn't end up being that large. We did see other plates around the restaurant and the waffles, pancakes, and omelets did come in extremely large portions so maybe we ordered the wrong things? (It was already 1pm so we weren't in the mood for breakfast anymore.)Quality is more important anyway so on that level, the food was good. But, not that good, considering the price.That brought Angie and I to the discussion about how very few restaurants really hit the wow factor. So, the only way to evaluate restaurants is just to evaluate whether the food quality, quantity, atmosphere, and service are worth the price. The result is no, not at this visit. The Monte Cristo was good but should have been served with a little salad or some fries. The description (grilled brioche with turkey, swiss, and honey-cured ham dressed with mango chutney) had given me high hopes for either exceptional brioche or a distinctive chutney. None of the ingredients were noteworthy. The seafood salad was a better value and almost worth the price since it was a good portion of crab, lobster, and shrimp. The description included scallops but I didn't taste any. Still, it was enjoyable and fresh. The good coffee (free refills) was surprisingly expensive at $6 per person. The $8 smoothie was too much as well and the decor and service are good but not special. Once seated, you are given a complimentary shot glass sized smoothie but that isn't enough to put it over the top. I don't want to make an ultimate decree after only trying two dishes but I'm not sure I'll be motivated to try them again any time soon.

Cuisinart DCC-1200 - 12 cup coffeemaker
CONTENT
I've been making coffee with a tiny little coffeemaker that makes a max of 4 cups at a time, for years. It was perfect during college but a pain these days since I love entertaining, and the more the merrier.So when Lon and I did our wedding registry, we did some research to pick out a good coffeemaker with a larger capacity, but we were concerned about how much counter space it would take up. After reading tons of reviews and looking at lots of specs, we chose the Cuisinart DCC-1200, a 12-cup programmable coffeemaker. We recently received the coffeemaker from Lon's relatives, Elaine and Stephen, and it has exceeded my expectations. It's easy to use and easy to clean, and very attractive. It has several functions and looks high-tech. But, I didn't realize that it would make better tasting coffee. The pamphlet explains that it's water filter improves the water therefore improving the coffee. I've heard that the temperature at which it brews can also effect the quality. I'm not sure what does it here, but I really think the same coffee (Kona is my main coffee) tastes better made by this coffeemaker.We've been seeing commercials for another model that looks similar but also grinds coffee beans before brewing, the Cuisinart DGB-600BC. That's convenient but it's about twice as expensive and coffee grinders cost about $20.If you're looking for a coffeemaker, I highly recommend the Cuisinart DCC-1200.

After visiting with my inlaws I was reminded of how much I like their coffeemaker.  It's a Bunn, not sure of the model, maybe a NHBX Brewer?Anyway it brews a whole pot (10 cups) way faster than other makers and has a nice warming feature too.

Dear Frederic
CONTENT
We recently received the following question from Frederic:Frederic, we're so glad you enjoy our blog. Here are a few suggestions for a nice dinner without breaking the bank...DinnerFor any of these, we strongly recommend reservations where possible on a Saturday night. We've picked a few selections from around the city so you can choose based both by cuisine and location.Novita Novita - A small, attractive Italian restaurant in Gramercy Park with very good food and service. They have a good wine list and excellent service.Mermaid Inn Mermaid Inn- A seafood place in the East Village with reasonable prices. It's simple food, done right. I love their lobster roll and their scallops. Read our full review of Mermaid Inn.Beyoglu Beyoglu - Delicious Turkish food on the Upper East Side. I highly recommend the octopus salad and their fresh pita/flatbread. Read our full review of Beyoglu.Tomoe Sushi Tomoe Sushi - Really fresh sushi and sashimi at great prices. The downside is that you have to wait on a long line, but at least it's in an attractive part of Greenwich Village, so there's often people watching. No reservations. Cash or Amex only. Read our full review of Tomoe.BrunchFor a nice Brunch on Sunday: Again, use reservations to be safe.Blue Water Grill Blue Water Grill - A classic NYC restaurant that serves brunch for $13-$27, with most dishes below $17. Conveniently located in Union Square so you can do some walking (and shopping) around after brunch.Punch Punch - Very inexpensive for a yummy brunch in a nice atmosphere. Just north of Union Square in the Flat Iron District. I recently went to Punch for Brunch.Jing Fong Jing Fong- Not your classic brunch but they serve dim sum which is really fun if you've never tried it. This banquet hall sized, second floor restaurant, is a good place to see the hustle and bustle of dim sum. Generally the food is better in Flushing but I don't know if you want to go out that far. After eating you can also walk around Chinatown and check out the little bakeries which are great. Get some roast pork buns and various breads and buns.We hope that was helpful. Please let us know which places you chose and what you thought of their food.Best,Jessica & Lon

Big Family Style Meal at Maple Garden
CONTENT
We met up with extended family, visiting for the holidays, for a family style meal in Flushing. My mom chose one of her favorite places, Maple Garden Maple Garden. I can understand why it's one of her favorites after seeing a bill for under $200, that more than satisfied a table of 14 people.I don't know the English name for many of these dishes so I tried to take a lot of pictures to facilitate with descriptions. We started with some cold platters, a traditional way to start a proper Chinese meal.The smoked chicken is one of my dad's favorites. I didn't care for the texture but Lon agreed with my dad.Pig ears is one of my childhood favorites. It's thinly sliced and marinated with fresh garlic and spicy oil. This sounds weird but I love the crunchiness of the cartilage.This dish of tiny dried fish, peanuts, and chilis was delicious. I had to try hard to hold back and pace myself since it was only the beginning of the meal.Yup, broccoli stems actually taste good. They're super crunchy and should not be thrown away. This one is also marinated with a spicy oil....and that was just the starters. Now comes the hot dishes.Ahh...soup dumplings. These weren't the best but very good.This was a really interesting stir-fry of shrimp, snow peas, and fish stomach. It's hard to describe the fish stomach but the texture is like a crisp sponge that soaks up flavor from the surrounding sauce. It was something different and surprisingly good.Perfectly cooked Dungeness Crab. One of the best dishes of the night!Pretty standard sauteed shrimp.To the left, there's three dishes. A great Whole fish in a sweet scallion sauce. You can't beat the flesh of fish that was just plucked out of the water. If you haven't had \"live killed\" fish from a Chinese restaurant, you have no idea what fresh fish tastes like. Then there was the simple stir-fry of bean curd, shredded pork, and celery. It's a nice blend of different textures. The string beans were also cooked nicely with chopped preserved vegetables to add a new flavor.In all the excitement of eating, I missed taking pictures of two dishes. The Hot Pepper Beef, which is a classic and my cousin Steve's favorite. It's a simple spicy dish that's great over rice. There was also a pork cutlet dish, my least favorite of the night. It was a boring dish and not attractive either.Honey Ham served over Lotus Seeds is a sweet dish that's served along side steamed white bread (originally steamed buns) so you can make little sandwiches. The ham here was a bit tough though.Rice cakes with Shredded Pork and chopped greens (that I don't know the English name of) is another standard. They did a good job with it but by now, I was so stuffed, I couldn't eat as much of it as I wanted to.Terrible picture but they make the best Turnip Pastry ever! It's a savory pastry that is sometimes eaten as breakfast, sometimes a snack or appetizer, and sometimes an end to a meal, so I can't really categorize but a must-have if you visit Maple Garden, which I think you should.

Strip House
CONTENT
Strip House has been on Lon's wish list for a while. We heard about their Crisp Goose Fat Potatoes, prepared by poaching potatoes in goose fat, then baking with goose fat, and finished by deep frying in goose fat. That's what we heard and we couldn't find any documentation on it, so off we went to taste these Crisp Goose Fat Potatoes. They were indeed very good. We couldn't taste much goose fat but did taste some parsley and a hint of rosemary. The texture was wonderful. The soft, yet still firm potato chunks inside were held by a very crisp shell of fried potato on the outside. The small dome of potato was pricey at $11.Of course, we also had the Strip Steak. We decided to share a 16oz steak and order the Sesame Crusted Yellow Fin Tuna to lighten our meal a bit. We didn't see any salads or appetizers that interested us and were actually surprised by the lack of creativity in the menu. We usually over order at restaurants because we can't decide between too many dishes that we want to try.We both enjoyed the Strip Steak, perfectly cooked at medium rare, well seasoned, and served with a bulb of roasted garlic. The tuna was nicely seared and beautifully presented but not seasoned and sitting in a flavorless sauce. The generous portion of fish was very fresh so it tasted fine after seasoning it ourselves.Going a bit backwards here. we started with a great bread basket. The onion bread and raisin roll were awesome. So overall, the food was enjoyable and the steak was priced well. I don't think we would go back though. The place has a cheesy old fashioned decor and I generally don't like eating in such dimly lit restaurants. Our waiter wasn't at all interested in us making me feel like he was annoyed at wasting his time with us. Also, there wasn't anything else on the menu that I wanted to try. We didn't even order dessert, as that menu was pretty boring as well.

Maurizio Update
CONTENT
I've given Maurizio glowing reviews in the past, but I just went again recently and I was a bit disappointed. The food wasn't bad but I just wasn't as impressed this time. My entree of jumbo shrimp were regular sized shrimp. With only four pieces of shrimp, it looked more like an appetizer on a large plate, which is not cool for $28. I've had this dish before and last time the shrimp were actually jumbo. The other notable difference was that the service was incredibly slow. Our appetizers came pretty quickly but after that, we waited for a very long time for the main course. A table of six shouldn't have been a problem, especially since we started dinner rather early.Since this was one bad experience vs. three good ones, I would give them a shot again. It's really sad when you find a good restaurant and then they can't keep it up.

We had friends over for dinner tonight and since one of our guests was a vegetarian, I decided to try to improve on that tofu recipe I had been working on for Lon. With just a few changes to the preparation and baking temperature (marinade staying the same), Lon loved the texture. Our guests seem to like it as well. It's not the most attractive looking tofu but it does taste good. My improved recipe is below the picture...Start with 1 Block (16-18oz) TofuMarinadeInstructionsIn case you're curious about what else we had for dinner:

It's a great site where users rate the recipes so you know if a recipe works before you make it.For the first time, I saw a page on the site where they highlight their most wanted recipes. Here's your chance to help another cook out. For example, someone requested Hunan style meals. This is understandable as there is a shortage of real Chinese recipes out there. So, please share!

Park Side Restaurant
CONTENT
My mom was so excited to take us to Park Side Restaurant Park Side Restaurant because her friend highly recommended it. My brother, Lon, and I all trekked from Manhattan to meet with my parents for this dinner, expecting it would be worth the travel. Well, it turned out to be a disappointment to all, and that is saying a lot because my mom and brother aren't that picky.I can't figure out why this place is so packed. It's supposed to be the classic old fashioned Italian restaurant and I guess they do a good job keeping that atmosphere. As I walked in, I did feel like I might see some Italian mobsters. We were seated on the second floor where tons of Maryland Monroe pictures dotted the walls. The wait staff are all in vests or suits and did a decent job with service. But the main problem remained. The food was pretty bad.They do give a large bread basket with a nice variety of breads but it came out ice cold, not just room temperature. Only one of the four appetizers we ordered was remotely interesting to me and yet had issues anyway, what they called Crab Cake. It was really a pile of crab meat which tasted fine but I just get annoyed at poorly written menus. The rest, sauteed portobellos, Clams Oreganata, and Prosciutto with Melon (honeydew was good but prosciutto was cheap junk) were all pretty flavorless and looked kind of sad.My mother, brother, and father, all ordered the same entree, Seafood Fra Diavalo (over linguini). I had the Calamari and Scungili Fra Diavalo (over linguini). Lon had the Veal Piccata. Everyone of us complained that our seafood or meat was over-cooked. No one finished their dish and at this table, that says something!! We are a whole bunch of plate lickers!! So, maybe people love their large portions but more of rubbery seafood does not make it better. Lon's Veal Piccata also looked really gross.As we walked to the car, we all exclaimed that we would never take a recommendation from my mom's friend again. Everyone was so let down by the meal. I can't even express to you how significant that is coming from my brother. I'm not sure he has ever complained about bad food before. He usually shrugs at most.As bad as the food was, this place is still pretty popular and I have to chalk it up to the fact that it's one of those old famous places that is still riding on it's name. People go wherever everyone else thinks it's cool to go. But, if you're a real foodie, the scenery does not make up for the bad food.

Korea Town Plaza
CONTENT
I went to Queens to do some food shopping, as I often do to avoid paying Manhattan prices. I frequent BJ's and Costco type places, Hong Kong Supermarket, smaller produce shops across Flushing, and Korea Town Plaza. My mom and I had so many errands to run today that we decided to save some time by eating lunch inside Korea Town Plaza. They have a a seating area in the back where you can order several different Korean dishes for around $5 each. It's not the best Korean food ever but it's a good portion of pretty good food for $5.As I sat down to write this blog, I found a disturbing article (from 1996) about the beginnings of Korea Town Plaza. It seems they have not played a fair game in competing with local businesses. Or, maybe the small businesses just created bad publicity because it was the only way they knew how to fight against Korea Town Plaza. It annoys me that the article leaves you hanging and I couldn't find much more info on the issue. I've been shopping at Korea Town Plaza for years and they have great prices (especially for meat). Now, I'm confused and don't know if I should continue shopping there.

Yum Yum Brunch

I had the Yum Yum Sisterhood over for Brunch. Our mission is always social eating but today we also started folding paper cranes for two important people to Julie and Lily, who were diagnosed with cancer. Our best wishes goes out to them. We had a great time as we always do and I got several compliments on the food. Here's what we had:Pumpkin Bread This is a simple and perfect pumpkin bread for a holiday season brunch. The texture and color is amazing. I will definitely make this again.Salmon Cake Benedict with Garlic Roasted PotatoesThis was my own creation. I did not write down an exact recipe for poaching the eggs, the sauce (a pseudo hollandaise), and the potatoes but I did finally write down my recipe for the salmon cakes that I've made several times. People always ask me for the recipe and I didn't have one until now:1 can (7oz) Kirkland brand Salmon (other canned salmons are awful)1 cup chickpeas, mashed1/4 cup minced yellow or white onion1 green onion, chopped1 egg1/2 teaspoon granulated garlic1 teaspoon cumin1/2 teaspoon dried cilantropinch cayenne (adjust to your spice)2 teaspoons olive oil or non-stick spray1. Mix all the ingredients in a bowl.2. Divide and shape into six patties. Set aside.3. Prepare a skillet with oil or non-stick spray on medium high heat.4. Place the patties on the pan, careful not to break them.5. Cook them for 3-4 minutes on each side.6. Remove from pan and serve. Whole Wheat Pancakes with Sauteed ApplesThe pancakes came out so fluffy and flavorful enough to eat alone but even better with sauteed apples on top.With all the excitement, I forgot to take more pictures of the food. =(

This Just In (the Inbox)
CONTENT
A few friends have sent in some links that FoodMayhem readers might find interesting. So we're sharing them with you. If you have interesting, food-related links that you think other FoodMayhem readers may enjoy, feel free to comment here or email them to us using the contact form. Thanks fellow foodies!Sent in by Steve, and created by the team behind Food for Design, a remarkable site by some Belgian foodies, with amazing creations and food photographer, check out \"FoodPairing\". Very much of the molecular gastronomy, Food Pairing demonstrates, graphically, how food tastes relate using tree maps. For example, based on the interchangeability of food based on flavor, chocolate should go just as well with, say, tortillas, as it does with almonds. Watch out now, Ferran.Also sent in by Steve, was an interesting article by Kim Sevenson of the New York Times, \"Is the Entree Heading for Extinction?\". The piece calls attention to the trend in upscale restaurants of moving towards tapas-style plates, smaller servings so that people can sample more dishes. While I do enjoy tapas, and go semi-regularly for that style of dining, I never feel completely satasfied at the end. It's purely psychological, but for me, I need an entree for a meal to feel different than a snack. Also, I enjoy larger dishes as they promote sharing. Unlike the \"family-size\" portions at New York restaurant Carmine's, which I find disturbingly huge, Chinese restaurant-size portions are more than enough for people to share, as are more Italian and Steakhouse-size portion (the steakhouse issue is mentioned in the article). There's certainly enough room in the world for both styles of dining, so welcome the new contenders.And from DelectaBILL, a great posting at Slate about what to buy your friendly foodie who has many cookbooks: more cookbooks! Some of those certainly sound like fun cookbooks. And if you're interested in something other than a cookbook as a gift, review our recently posted list of FoodMayhem foodie gift ideas.Thanks everyone, keep those great links coming!

Chocolate Bar and Soba Nippon
CONTENT
While shopping, Sara and I stopped in at The Chocolate Bar inside Henri Bendel's The Chocolate Bar inside Henri Bendel's. The liquid chocolate and coffee is good but it wasn't the beverages that I will remember. It's a nice place to take a break from shopping since they have great window seats (which was perfect for us since it was snowing) and their staff is fantastic. Both guys just seemed so happy to be there.After we finished shopping (more looking, not buying), Sara and I headed to Soba Nippon Soba Nippon, a place known for their house-made soba. We decided to share a Soba Salad (with chicken) since Sara had read good things about it, and a Hot Soba with Tonkatsu since we both wanted something hot.The salad was very good, more because the fresh soba is excellent, less because the shredded chicken is dry. I'm glad I tried it but wouldn't pay $24 for it again. I also just noticed by looking online, that the salad is more expensive during lunch time than dinner time. At lunch, they do include a great miso soup, but still weird, no?The Hot Soba with Tonkatsu was also half good/half not. The soup had a good flavor. The soba was again excellent. The tonkatsu was overcooked, dry, and chewy. Again, quite pricey for a bowl of soba that I enjoyed but would not feel the need to have again. Two pieces of inari (that was too sweet) and a generous house salad was included which almost makes it worth it but not.Since their dinner prices look about the same (or less in the case of the Soba Salad), I'd probably be less opposed to recommending them for dinner so if you go, do make sure you eat soba.

Confuzzled?
CONTENT
Is it a cookie? Or, is it a candy? That's part of the marketing of Confuzzled products. I tried some on display at Henri Bendel's today and I did think it was yummy. So did Sara, who asked for another piece. The simple and clever combo of chocolate and saltine crackers is another fabulous example of how well sweet and salty can work together but what's got me really confuzzled is that it's $18 for an 8oz package.

I make something like this. Dang, I should have sold them.  So easy...line saltines on a baking sheet, brush with melted butter.  top with mini choc chips and put in 350 oven until chips start to melt (less than five minutes).  Spread chips to finish melt and top with whatever.  I've used sprinkles, marshmallows and many other candies.Allow to cool, then break into cookie size pieces.

New York Food Trucks

I just stumbled across this cool page with a map and description of 10 New York Food Trucks. It is not even close to a complete list but still very useful since several trucks are totally forgettable. The one I can't believe they left out is The Halal TruckThe Halal Truck. It is uber famous in NYC (as you can see from the 102 Yelp reviews) as the after-clubbing truck. There is an amazingly long line but it moves pretty quickly.

Baked SesameTofu
CONTENT
Lon is not a big fan of tofu but likes the texture of the tofu at City Bakery. He's not sure, but thinks it might be baked and then seared. I haven't tried it yet and decided to try baking some tofu to see if Lon likes it. We both really liked the result.First, make sure you use a good tofu. There is a huge difference between fresh tofu and packaged tofu. I like buying fresh tofu from a store on the corner of Bowery and Grand. They sell three blocks per box, each about 3.5″x3.5″x1.5″.Press the tofu between two plates and put something heavy on top. Let the tofu drain for an hour, while pouring the liquid out every 20 minutes. While the tofu is draining, you can make the marinade by whisking ingredients together. Place the tofu in the marinade and refrigerate for three hours, turning blocks of tofu over once. I baked it in a 400 degree F oven for 25-30 minutes (with some marinade coating the bottom of a pan) because I was also making a roasted pork tenderloin. I've read that it is better slow baked at a lower temperature. Optionally, you can sprinkle some toasted sesame seeds on top before serving.Marinade:I served the Baked Sesame Tofu with white rice, Chinese broccoli, and a roasted pork tenderloin. The tenderloin was marinated overnight in the same marinade I used for the turkey legs. The dinner was a big success!

Vietnamese Coffee
CONTENT
When my mom came back from a tour of Asia, she brought me some coffee and a filter from Vietnam. As I was making myself a cup this morning, I thought, everyone should have a Vietnamese coffee filter! It's perfect for one cup. (Lon doesn't drink coffee.) It takes up very little space and is easy to use. The inexpensive filter is available online so you don't need to go to Vietnam to get one.

Bouley
CONTENT
Bouley Bouley is one of my favorite restaurants, and also one of Lon's, but this was our first time there together. Everything about this place is wonderful. They have lovely decor that includes fresh flowers on every table. They use high quality ingredients to make beautifully presented food that is always delicious. The top notch service is high class but not stuffy and I always leave feeling like I had thoroughly enjoyed myself.This visit, we decided to bring my family for lunch as a holiday meal. It's the perfect place to impress guests and my parents did mention that they wanted to bring my dad's best friend (a total foodie), next time. As we entered the first corridor, the wonderful smell of apples begins the fantasy. They had lined the entrance with different colored apples. After we checked our coats, we were seated in the white room (picture is the red room) and I tried to take in all the great detail. I loved the drapes, the flower arrangements, and the arched ceilings. Lon and I sipped some tea as we waited for our guests.For lunch, Bouley offers a $38 tasting menu, a $48 tasting menu, and a la carte dishes. I recommended the $48 tasting menu to my family and we took our time making choices as we sampled the fresh warm breads that were just placed on each of our bread plates. My brother and I really enjoyed the apple raisin while my mom favored the whole wheat mini baguette. So fresh! Using several servers, they always ensure that everyone at the table is served at the same time -- I love that! So out came the Chef's Canape - a Roasted Beet Gelee with Horseradish Cream and Toasted Pumpkin Seeds. I wasn't a huge fan, but my mom loved it and finished mine. As the plates were cleared, I saw the bread cart being rolled over to us (one of my favorite little details). Bouley offers a wide variety of fresh breads from their bakery. You can try as much of any as you like during your meal, but be careful: I often over stuff myself. Between all of us asking for different ones, I tried most of them. The black and white pepper and the saffron walnut were unique and well executed. The fig, the roasted garlic, and pistachio breads were of course superb.After already making myself half full, our first course comes out and reminds me that we just started. I chose the Phyllo-Crusted Florida Shrimp, Cape Cod Baby Squid, Scuba Dived Sea Scallop, Sweet Maryland Crabmeat in an Ocean Herbal Broth. Every piece of seafood was cooked perfectly and the scallops were possibly, the best I've ever had. The portion was generous and the balance of flavors and the delicate broth made all of us (everyone but Lon had chosen the same first course) repetitively profess our love for this perfectly executed dish. Lon chose the Sashimi-Quality Tuna with Shaved Fennel, Dressed in Herb Oils and a Spicy Marinade. It was absolutely fresh and well plated, but not as exceptional as our multi-seafood dish. Most of us ordered the same second course as well (I guess we really are related, haha), a Skate with some sort of pineapple and herb sauce. It was cooked perfectly and displayed the wonderful texture of skate that I love. I would've liked the sauce to be a little stronger though. For my third course, I chose the Baby Piglet, served on top of a noodle cake. I was very surprised that the meat was a little dry/over-cooked and none of us liked the noodle cake that had no flavor. The dish seemed to need a sauce desperately. I quickly forgot about my dish though as I sampled my dad's organic duckling that looked beautiful and Lon's chicken which was also impressively tender. We were also given three plates of potato puree, so smooth and buttery.At this point, we were all pretty full but there was so much more to come. The grapefruit soup and lemon sorbet palate cleanser was wonderful. It was light and very refreshing and the hint of cardamom made it unique. I shouldn't have eaten the whole thing knowing that desserts were coming. Some of us ordered the Valrhona Chocolate Souffle with Vermont Maple Ice Cream, Vanilla Bean Ice Cream, and Chocolate Ice Cream. Some of us ordered the Passionfruit Meringue with Berries. The meringue wasn't really a meringue, which is why I liked it. The texture was more like a souffle than the chocolate souffle which was almost a molten chocolate cake. I'm not complaining though since both were wonderful and just need new names. We thought we were done but I had forgotten that the Pastry Chef usually sends another complimentary dessert. His presentation was a layered tall shot glass with white chocolate mousse as the base, some shredded pineapple, topped with a curry sorbet. The flavors worked so well together. It tasted so good, even though I was so full, and the creativity is applauded. Of course, Bouley also serves a plate of mini desserts as many top restaurants do. I could barely open my mouth at this point and just enjoyed how cute they looked.As you leave, Bouley offers a little gift for the ladies. Today, it was a loaf-shaped cake, which I haven't tried yet since I'm still in food coma. Although not every dish was absolutely perfect, I still left feeling fully satisfied because there was enough great stuff to make the price worth it. I hope it's not too long before I get to go to Bouley again.

Happy Edible Holidays - Good Gifts for your Foodie
CONTENT
Lon does not like presents that are not edible. I made the mistake of buying him a sweater once. The Brooks Bothers sweater is still sitting in our bedroom with tags on it. I noticed that his family really just buys him food, for every holiday and birthday. So, what's a good present for a foodie?1. Vinegars - They come in an amazing array of awesome flavors like fig or pomegranate balsamic, strawberry champagne, ginger rice, etc. They are available in all price ranges too, starting from around $3 to around $45 for a good bottle of aged balsamic.2. Olive Oil - Olive oil also varies greatly in price. For a present, you want to get an Extra Virgin Olive Oil. Some come in gorgeous bottles too.3. Gourmet Sea Salts - I don't use iodized salt(table salt) for cooking generally and a good salt makes a big difference. One of my favorite presents is when Lon's sister brought us some Red Alaea Sea Salt from Hawaii.4. Distinctive Meats - Lon's mom once bought him ostrich meat and I love buffalo meat and wild boar. Unfortunately, these meats are not always readily available at your local supermarket but that's what makes the present more special.5. Expensive Spices - Most chefs would welcome some extra saffron, real cinnamon (commercially available cinnamon is not actual cinnamon), or vanilla beans.6. Gift Certificate to a restaurant or bakery - So for this Hannukah, I'm taking Lon to Strip House Strip House, a restaurant he's been dying to go to because he heard about their Crisp Goose Fat Potatoes. We'll let you know soon if they're any good.

Awesome BBQ Turkey
CONTENT
We've been trying to eat less pork because of Lon's cholesterol. He doesn't like tofu that much and I don't want to eat chicken every day. As you may have read before, I'm not a fan of breast meat so I bought turkey legs. I decided to de-bone them (leave skin on) because I wanted to use the grill. This marinade is enough for 2-3 turkey legs. Grill time will vary because turkey legs vary greatly in size.Marinade:Just mix ingredients together and marinate meat for at least 4 hours.The turkey tasted a bit like BBQ Pork and we both loved it!! I'm sure the marinade would be great for chicken or pork as well.

Two of my best friends have just started to try a little bit of cooking. They have almost no experience and both get very nervous about it. They asked me where they should start and I recommend that beginners start by using recipes. Certain dishes are easier than others and I have compiled a short list of the best ones to start with because they are hard to mess up. So, if you're a beginner ready to start, just look up any of these recipes on www.allrecipes.com and pick one that is rated well. Let me know how it turns out!Vegetarian or Meat Chili - Great one pot meals where you don't have to worry about over cooking.Salad Dressings and Dips - Most are just putting all the ingredients together and stirring or shaking.Baked Ziti - especially easy if you use jarred sauceMeatballs - A little more work but still easy.Mashed Potatoes - Just don't over mix.Tacos and FajitasTuna Pasta SaladChicken CacciatoreCapreseReuben SandwichSmoothies - you'll need a blenderFor Desserts, start with trying boxed cake mixes and then move onto these:Carrot CakeMost TriflesChocolate Chip CookiesOatmeal CookiesOnce you're comfortable, move on to more advanced stuff. Just remember, that accurate measurements are important in baking.

Bhutanese Red Rice
CONTENT
There are tons of exotic rices out there but I haven't tried many of them. (Ooh, that may become a future project.) A friend gave us a package of Bhutanese Red Rice, made by Lotus Foods, and Lon was hesitant because he doesn't like brown rice. As it was cooking, Lon started to gain interest because of the fantastic aroma coming from the pot.I decided to serve the rice with a Chicken and Spinach in Sa Cha Sauce. The red rice has a pretty red color and looked great against the spinach. The nutty flavor is distinct and we both liked the very chewy texture. My only complaint is that it's hard to eat with chopsticks because the grains don't stick at all.

Korean Fast Food
CONTENT
Since my favorite Korean Grandma shop closed, I haven't been able to get delivery of Korean food.Last night, I was desperate for some but had a major headache and didn't want to make the trek to K-town. I wined for about 30 minutes and then thought of the Korean fast food place Lon had ordered from when he used to work near by. Express Manna Kitchen Express Manna Kitchen is run by Korean people but seems to cater to Americans since it has given American names to many dishes on their menu. That already scares me, but I was desperate for Korean food so we gave it a shot. I ordered the Kalbi Tang (a beef rib soup with egg and glass noodles) and Lon ordered the Bulgolgi Donburi (classic Korean marinated bbq meat on top of rice). While neither was as good as the real thing, it satisfied my craving enough to hold me over. My beef rib didn't have much flavor and Lon's Bulgolgi was mega sweet but the portions are huge and their brown rice is the best. This is not a place I would recommend for trying Korean food but if you really need one in the area, it'll do.

Organic Chocolate and Natural Jelly Belly's
CONTENT
Are you sick of me talking about chocolate and candy yet? Well, there's still lots left to review.I just tried the Green & Black's Organic Dark Chocolate with Hazelnuts and Currants. The dark chocolate is yummy but I don't taste the hazelnuts and the currants are too sour for this combo. I'm not saying I wouldn't eat this chocolate if it was presented to me but it's not the one I would choose. So yes, I'm still going to finish this whole bar! (I feel justified since I ran the 15K Hot Chocolate Run this morning.)Next, exciting news! Jelly Belly now makes 10 flavors in a natural version. No artificial flavors or colors and no preservatives. They don't taste as good as my memory of regular jelly belly's (from before I developed an allergy to artificial food coloring) but hey it's natural. Strawberry is my favorite flavor and they're easy to bring on runs, just like Sport Beans. (If you're running in cold weather, they do get a little hard.) I'm waiting to see if more flavors will be available in natural. I loved juicy pear as kid (Hint Hint: people at Jelly Belly).

I just received a gift from my mom from a company called Organica Deluxe and got two really unbelievable types of organic chocolate in the package. There were two bars, one was a milk chocolate and the other was a dark chocolate from a company called Dagoba. I am a huge dark chocolate fan and it did not disappoint. My boyfriend's mom loved the milk chocolate. The other chocolate in the gift box was a box of small, rich, dark chocolate cubes with cocoa powder dusted on them and they were from a company called Intemperantia. My grandmother got an Organica Deluxe gift basket with truffles from Intemperantia which are unbelievable.Just a couple of additional organic chocolates that I loved and highly recommend!You can find them at organicadeluxe.com

Thanks Jennifer, good stuff!  I have to check out OrganicaDeluxe.com and Intemperantia, I'm not familiar with that brand.  I have tried Dagoba, and while it's pretty good, for some reason I'm jaded over the fact that Hershey owns them.  Did you see our post called "Organic Profits"?Jessica says that Hershey's redeemed themselves a bit though with their Cacao Reserve line, particularly the dark chocolate.  She mentioned them in "The Sweet Spot" article.

Healthier Chocolate Oatmeal Cake
CONTENT
I've been eating a lot of dessert lately so I wanted something healthier. I was bringing it to a friend's dinner so I still wanted it to meet expectations. I found a recipe for Chocolate Oatmeal Cake and altered it to lessen the fat and sugar.For the cake: I changed the half cup of margarine to 4 tablespoons of unsalted butter. I reduced the white sugar to half a cup and the brown sugar to half a cup.For the frosting: I cut the amount of confectioner's sugar in half to 2 cups.If you're a perfectionist, I recommend cutting off the edges because they get a little crispy. The rest of the cake is lovely and moist. All of my friends really enjoyed it.

Nam So'n
CONTENT
Two of my bridesmaids, Sara and Angie, went with me to check out a store for bridesmaids dresses. We were already in Chinatown so dinner was easy. We decided on a Vietnamese restaurant that Angie and Sara frequently visit, Nam So'n.As I went to the bathroom, Sara and Angie picked out all the things they wanted to eat which mounted to four dishes so when I got back, my only input was a strong confirmation for ordering it all. I was excited to try some new things. My favorite was the Bun Thit Nuong (Grilled Pork with Lettuce and Vermicelli). This is a fun dish where you wrap the pork, pickled vegetables, and vermicelli in the lettuce. Then we had two pretty good dishes: Banh Mi Bo Kho (Stewed Beef with Bread) which was very reminiscent of Chinese Red Stewed Beef and the Pho (something you have to order at a Vietnamese restaurant). The sauce in the stewed beef was a bit on the sweeter side and got cold too fast, but otherwise good. The Pho was better than the Pho from Saigon Grill or L'annam, but not better than Pho in Los Angeles. Con Chien Bit Tet (Steak and Fried Rice) was the least favorite because the steak was hard to chew.The meal was good enough that we almost finished all of the food. Our waiter was quite impressed with the three of us finishing four dishes, in Chinatown portions. I would recommend trying it because I haven't found much better Vietnamese food in New York and at about $30 for all that food, it's worth a try.

Baby Food for Mommy
CONTENT
I was making some organic butternut squash puree for my niece Sabrina who just started eating. I ended up with way more than she could eat so I made some soup for Sabrina's mommy, Kasi. The puree for Sabrina was made by just cutting the peeled and seeded butternut squash into chunks and boiling in water for 20 minutes. Then putting it into the blender using as much or as little water as necessary for the consistency you want. To make it into soup, I just added some cinnamon, nutmeg, ground ginger, and salt and pepper. To my surprise, the fat free soup was delicious. No cream necessary! Sabrina liked her butternut squash too.

Italian Village Pizzeria
CONTENT
We were actually planning to have Steve and Yael over for dinner last night. I had planned an Asian style meal of Curried Carrot Soup, Beef Skewers on a bed of Fried Rice, Garlic Baby Bok Choy. I was in the middle of cooking when Lon and I started to smell a toxic odor. It turns out that the neighboring apt was staining the floors. We tried opening all of our windows and thought maybe the smell would go away. An hour later, I was developing a headache and Lon was nauseated. I was basically done with dinner at that point but I had to pack it all up so we could take Ice (our Jack Russell) and escape.So last minute, our plan had changed, we were in a cab and on our way to Kasi's (Lon's sister) apt and we had to figure out what to do with out dinner guests. Kasi generously offered to have Steve and Yael over and so we ordered in from Italian Village Pizzeria Italian Village Pizzeria(Kasi and Stephen's regular Italian place).Kasi and Stephen love Italian Village and Yael was really happy with her Penne Bolognese. I'm the food perfectionist so I'll have to pick at a few things but generally, I'd have no problem ordering from there again. I ordered a plain pizza and while the sauce is very tasty, they put a bit too much on, and a lot of cheese, so large clumps of cheese and sauce slide right off the pizza. I prefer my pizza to stay in tact while I eat it. The excess sauce also tends to make the crust more soggy than crispy on the bottom. Lon ordered a Spaghetti with Meat Sauce with added Meatballs. The meat and sauce was good for pizzeria food but the spaghetti tasted over-cooked. To be fair, the food did sit a while before we ate so it could have gotten soggy then but I reheated my pizza in the toaster over (as I always do with delivered pizza cause I like it really hot) and that didn't help the sogginess of the pizza.The prices are good and the delivery was pretty fast. It's a good safety delivery menu to have around.

We're pretty sure the regular pizza guy was off that night.  His pizzas are less 'slippy', but he always puts the little plastic package saver (the thing that keeps the box off the pizza) on upside down.  A pet peeve of ours but he makes a mighty fine pie.

Brunch at Taco Taco
CONTENT
My friend Stephanie introduced me to some new running buddies who are actually more in to brunch than running but hey, can't blame them. We met at Engineer's Gate and ran the inner loop (4 miles) in Central Park so that we could justify our brunch so soon after Thanksgiving feasting. Karen recommended Taco Taco Taco Tacobased on reading some reviews on Yelp.com and we were all happy with the pick. As one reviewer mentioned, you would never think a place with such a name could be the real deal.Their brunch menu was so exciting; so many items I wasn't familiar with. I'm used to reading menus that read soft tacos, hard tacos, burritos, fajitas, or salads. Then choose beef, pork, chicken, or vegetarian, and sometimes shrimp. At Taco Taco, there was a wide variety of omelets, all the standard fair, and then at least five dishes I hadn't heard of. Unfortunately, I can't remember any other than the one I ordered, but the Cazuela was so good. It's a baked dish with tortilla, black beans, roasted poblano chiles, sunny side up eggs, sauce, and melted cheese. If you like all of those ingredients, as I do, you will love the Cazuela. I was also surprised that it wasn't at all oily. I often feel gross after a Mexican meal even if I do love it. I finished the entire dish and felt like I had a pretty healthy meal.I would definitely recommend brunch at Taco Taco and I will probably bring Lon there. It's a no frills place but the service is fine and the prices are right.

As I drank my cup of Kona Joe coffee today, I realized that I never blogged about my stock coffee. Kona Joe is the only coffee I serve at my place and that's why all of my friends always ask for coffee when they come over. Don't be fooled by the other \"Kona\" coffees. They may be as little as 10% Kona, blended with other beans. Kona Joe is 100% pure Kona coffee and it makes a big difference. Even their decaffeinated coffees taste good.

Happy Thanksgiving Left-Overs!
CONTENT
Thanksgiving is a great food holiday. It's a wonderful feast that brings family together but then everyone stresses out about what to do with leftovers afterwards. At first I was going to write a bunch of ideas for what to do with left over turkey, cranberry sauce, etc. but I noticed a better idea: more gathering and sharing!We had so much dessert at Aunt Ilene's house that she decided to have neighbors over for canasta today to help finish off desserts like Chocolate Trifle, Apple Crumb Pie, Pumpkin Roll, Cranberry Oatmeal Cookies, Cranberry Apple Pie, Berry Pie, Chocolate Bundt Cake, and a Herbie (Lon's mom's famous pie that tastes like chocolate chip cookie dough with a Kahlua Whip Cream). Kasi also mentioned that she is going to her friend Becca's house tomorrow to help finish left-overs over there.If you have left-overs, call some friends and have a left-overs potluck. Then you won't get sick of eating the same thing for the next week. If there's still food left-over, you can all swap some food and have new left-overs.

Apple Pie with Cranberries
CONTENT
I'm making an Apple Cranberry Pie to bring to Lon's aunt Ilene's house for Thanksgiving. I've made this pie several times and always use different apples depending on what's available in the farmer's market. I love baking with Mutsu apples and Granny Smith's but I didn't see good ones available so I used Cameo's and Jonagold's. It's a perfect Thanksgiving pie to share because it makes a nice presentation and tastes great.Of course you also need a good pie crust. The recipe I used for a double crust calls for 2/3 cup shortening. I used 1/3 cup butter and 1/3 cup vegetable shortening in attempt to get the best of both worlds. Vegetable shortening (like Crisco) has a a higher melting point than butter and is easier to work with but, has no taste. Using some butter, gives the pie crust that buttery flavor we love.

Perry Street
CONTENT
I was really psyched to have lunch with my friend Angie. We both have long restaurant wish lists and were about to knock another off the list together: Jean George's Perry StreetPerry Street. Their lunch special is two dishes and dessert for $24.We made sure to choose different items in order to sample more. The Yuzu and Green Chili Scented Nishiki Risotto was topped with shaved Matsutake mushrooms and foam. The risotto was impressive in appearance but mediocre in taste and texture. It was very mushroom-y which was boring after a few bites and the rice wasn't as starchy as risotto should be. The Arctic Char Sashimi was sitting in a pool of very good olive oil but the fish itself was flavorless. Angie and I both recognized that the fish was fresh with a good texture, yet surprisingly tasteless. The Poached Snapper was cooked perfectly yet the flavoring of some chili oil was nothing special. The Grilled Bluefin Tuna Burger was a generous portion and wonderfully balanced. The bonito mayo and shiso/yuzu pickles worked perfectly with the seared chopped tuna meat and soft seeded bun. The whole burger was light and refreshing and the definite favorite of the meal. The desserts were pretty good: a chocolate pudding with a little bit of chocolate cake and a white chocolate sandwiched in meringue with yuzu sorbet. Angie also ordered a passion fruit chili soda that she really enjoyed.The service was good. The white minimalist decor seems so common these days. But more importantly, the food......we weren't impressed enough to go back, especially because it's pretty out of the way. If you do find yourself at Perry Street for lunch, go for the Bluefin Tuna Burger.

I just had dinner there the other night -- it was atrocious.  I ordered the lobster -- which was sub par -- but the disgusting "3 scoops" of mayonnaise made it inedible.  My friends had the arcic char -- tasteless, and the tomato soup looked and tasted like Capmbell's.  The shrimp appetizer was also not particularly good. I must say it was one of the worst meals I have ever had.

So, here's another good pumpkin recipe: Pumpkin Oatmeal Cookies! It's an easy recipe and the picturesque cookies have a wonderful golden color. I used Craisins instead of raisins, which I often do because I like Craisins more. I would've liked the pumpkin flavor to be more pronounced but I'm still sure this will be a crowd pleaser.

Hey, it's Thanksgiving and I love pumpkin cakes, breads, and rolls. I don't like pumpkin pie though. For me, it's the texture. Pumpkin pie is like a wet custard and it's usually ultra sweet as well. For a nice and easy quickbread recipe, try this Pumpkin Cranberry Bread. I didn't have two 9×5 loaf pans so I used one 9×5 loaf pan and one 8×8 square glass baking dish. I removed the 8×8 baking dish from the oven at 40 minutes and the loaf pan at 50 minutes. Both came out the same. Yum.Also, the dough looks strong enough to bake free form to make scones. If you try that, let me know how it comes out!

I used to go to Murray's Bagels Murray's Bagels pretty often when I was in the area more. They did always have good bagels and they make several batches a day so sometimes you can catch some warm bagels fresh out of the oven. Nothing beats fresh, warm breads! Today, I tried one of their health grain bagels. I was a bit shocked that the bagel was $1.15 with nothing on it but it was a very good bagel. It had the right chewiness and a wonderful nuttiness, without the dryness that many whole wheat or grain bagels have. Despite the price (Do you remember when bagels were 25 cents?), I'd by it again.

Lon and I are huge pizza fans. We're always excited about a new pizza place near us but unfortunately, Pizza 33 Pizza 33 was a disappointment. I ran in for quick plain slice today and concluded that it wasn't worth the $2.25. The thin slice needed more cheese and each component, crust, sauce, and cheese was flavorless. They also committed my biggest peeve; the pizza was barely heated! The guys at the counter also asked my friend Jamie and I several times if it was to stay or to go. We answered \"to go\" each time and they still forgot to pack her slice to go. That's really not a big deal but the bottom line is that the pizza is below average.

So, I have a question for you. My wife is a native brazilian, and I spent 2 years in Brazil doing voluntary service. I ABSOLUTELY loved the pizza there. My wife told me this was becuase Pizza had been created by Italian Immigrants who were living in Brazil prior to actually becoming popular in Italy and that therefore the first pizzas were created in Brazil. Is this true?
Lon
2008-02-27 10:35:00
dallltho, interesting question indeed! There is a large Italian population in Brazil, as well as many other South American countries, particularly Argentina.  This migration was part of Italian diaspora. It is very likely that these Italians brought the concept of pizza with them (although like the history of most foods, there is no hard fact to prove it).Pizza is widely popular in Brazilian cuisine. However, depending on where you lived in Brazil, I suspect you had one of many different styles. According to Wikipedia's entry (which sounds accurate from what I've heard):"Pizza is also extremely popular. It is usually made in a wood-fire oven with a thin, flexible crust, very little sauce, and a number of interesting toppings. In addition to the 'traditional' Italian pizza toppings, items like guava jam and cheese, banana and cinnamon, catupiry and chicken, and chocolate are available. Many Brazilians from the northern states enjoy putting ketchup on pizza, and even mayonnaise and mustard may be added. Although, in the state of São Paulo and the southern states where Italian influence is strong, this practice is considered 'almost insulting' or 'culturally demeaning.'"

The pork filling and dough were both so dense that it's no surprise that they weren't cooked through. Yes, they were cold in the center. The meat was also completely flavorless.I now had low expectations for our main dishes but they were actually not that bad. I wouldn't really call it Chinese food but it was good \"fake Chinese\". Lon chose a Chicken with Black Bean Sauce. He asked that they add snow peas and they happily accommodated. The dish was a bit salty but otherwise perfectly cooked chicken and vegetables. I asked for a special, Garlic Prawns with garlic, fried shallots, and scallions on a bed of steamed vegetables. We were both impressed with the generous portion of large shrimp and the more somewhat authentic flavor of this dish. Lon had also asked the waiter to make sure the dishes weren't too oily and both dishes were definitely less oily than most \"fake Chinese\". I was happy not to feel gross after the meal.The Cottage isn't a place I would choose to go to but it's also not a place I would refuse to go to if someone else wanted to go.

Lon and I love trying new stuff so when we saw a new herb in the farmer's market, we had to try it. The sign said Delfino Cilantro and it smells just like the cilantro or Chinese parsley available in your local supermarket. The fern-like leaves are attractive and the flavor is like a parsley/cilantro mix in a milder form with a hint of citrus.The flavor seems too mild to withstand cooking but works well raw: try salads, salsas, or freshly chopped and sprinkled on to any dish right before serving.

Dove Origins and Dark Snickers
CONTENT
I promised to keep you updated as I continued to eat through the giant pile of candy from the Sweet Spot. Dove has a new line of dark chocolates called Origins. They are made with 61% cacao and are separated by origin: Ecuador, Ghana, and the Dominican Republic. Unfortunately, I didn't get a piece from Ecuador (and I'm not going to buy any candy for a year now). However, I was surprised to find such a distinct difference between Dominican Republic piece and the Ghana piece. The dark chocolate from the Dominican Republic had a strong fruitiness that's almost raspberry-like. The dark chocolate from Ghana was pure and so smooth. I was particularly fond of it.Snickers Dark came out a while ago but since I lost interest in candy bars years ago, I never bothered to try it. (Snickers was my favorite candy bar as a kid.) Lon and I agree that it's better than the original. The dark chocolate is less sweet and doesn't cause that sugary feeling in the back of your throat. I may actually eat these once in a while.

Chocolate Chip Apple Cake?
CONTENT
When I first saw this recipe, I thought it was a weird combo: chocolate chips and apples? But when you bake a lot, you start feeling like you've made everything so I felt adventurous and gave it a shot. It was actually surprisingly good. Lon and Resa, my two dinner companions last night, both complimented the cake.My one complaint would be that the sugars create a harder outside to the cake. But, the inside does stay very moist. You might think that you could just reduce the sugar but the inside of the cake is not very sweet and to me, just right.

Angie arranged a surprise birthday lunch for Sara at JaneJane. We didn't have the full party and the birthday girl was delayed but the hosts and wait staff were kind enough to accommodate us. Jane doesn't officially serve brunch on Saturdays but does serve some of their brunch items. We ordered the Goat Cheese Flatbread and Vanilla Bean French Toast for the table. The flatbread needed a stronger goat cheese and the onions seemed weak as well. The French toast was a big hit with all 7 of us. The thick slabs of brioche bread with creme brulee batter was so delicious and had the perfect texture.For a main, I ordered the Benedict Jane: crab and crawfish cakes, topped with poached eggs, and a light tarragon hollandaise sauce, served with a side of potatoes. The perfectly poached eggs were a great texture contrast to the crab and crawfish cakes and the flavors worked well together. Everyone was happy with their food and service so I can see why this place is packed. I don't think anything wowed me enough for a repeat visit though, except for the French toast.

The Sweet Spot
CONTENT
On Wednesday I attended a great candy, chocolate, and gum showcase called \"The Sweet Spot\", featuring hot trends and new products in the candy world. It was a well organized show, broken up into areas or rooms based on how one would use each product. It was a great idea because with over 70 products, it would have been way too overwhelming and hard to remember any information. We were brought through the rooms on a tour where our guide briefly described products and we sampled any that caught our interest.I did not sample anything made with artificial food coloring (since I'm allergic) so you won't get any taste opinions on the new Mike and Ike or Jelly Belly flavors, but they do have some cool sounding new flavors. I also did not sample every non-colored item either since there was just too much to sample, but I was given at least one of everything to take home so stay tuned for more reviews as the days go by. (I am going to be so fat by Christmas.) On the Go Nestle Butterfinger and Crunch both come in Stixx versions. At 90 calories each, they make good purse stuffers. I liked how the Butterfinger Stixx are less sweet than the Butterfinger Bar, which I don't like just because of how sweet it is. The Crunch Stixx is still too sweet.Kitchen CocoaVia Chocolate Beverage - Marketed as part of the heart healthy product line, the CocoaVia chocolate drink guarantees flavanol levels. It's the adult chocolate milk, made with skim milk and less sweet than your childhood version.Living Room Toblerone - A Swiss chocolate that we're pretty familiar with in the US, now has more sizes and gift bags. This is Lon's favorite, commercially available chocolate bar. I also learned that in Europe, Toblerone is most used for chocolate fondue. I tried a strawberry dipped in the fondue (which was made with Toblerone, cream, and vegetable oil) and I was surprised to find that I didn't like it that much. It was a bit too gooey. Ghiradelli - This San Francisco (hey, we were just there) chocolate company has always been one of my favorites for commercially available chocolate for both eating and baking. They now have a new line of Intense Dark with flavors like Mint Bliss, Citrus Sunset, Toffee Interlude, Espresso Escape, and Twighlight Delight (Plain chocolate in 72% Cocoa). I tried the Twighlight Delight. Yum!Dining Room Dove Extra Dark - The 63% cocoa chocolate is very smooth, but the packaging is not up to par with the other new dark chocolate lines that seem to be the trend. Cote D'or - Our tour guide promised we'd be seeing a lot more of this Belgium chocolate since its recent partnership with Kraft Foods. This is good news since it was a good chocolate. Kids' Area Hot Tamales Sprays - This was the only one I tried in this area since the rest were colored. Maybe kids like spraying candy flavors in their mouths, but I didn't and it's hard to aim without getting some on your face or hair. Bubble Roll Message Maker - This was one of the coolest products! Taking Bubble Tape to the next level is two types: one where you can print letter by letter onto the bubble tape and one where it prints IM language (LOL, OMG, etc.) onto the bubble tape. I would've been one of those 10-year old girls handing messages to girlfriends on bubble tape.Bathroom & Home Office These areas had tons of gums and mints. I didn't try any yet and I'm not a big fan of mint flavors but the trend seems to be cool, sleek packaging, and products that clean or whiten teeth.Holiday Area Intense Dark Moments Gift Box - This Ghiradelli Gift Box comes with a wine pairing guide. Hershey's Fresh From the Factory - You can now purchase certain Hershey's products fresh from the factory, which means eating it within 96 hours from leaving the production line. I sampled a factory fresh Reese's Peanut Butter Cup and there is a difference. The chocolate tastes the same but the peanut butter doesn't. You can taste the freshness and the texture is much smoother. I'm not enough of a candy fan to pay those prices but it makes a great gift for a fanatic.Wine Pairing Cacao Reserve by Hershey's - I was very impressed by this line by Hershey's. I didn't expect this kind of quality from them. My favorite is the Premium Dark Chocolate Truffles that come eight in a tin (similar to an Altoids tin). I like the idea of being able to carry around truffles with me. The truffles also come in milk chocolate and while I'm not normally a fan, it is amazing when paired with a chilled white Riesling (Michael Mondavi). This will definitely become a new bad habit of mine, sitting on my couch with truffles and white wine.One of the major trends that The Sweet Spot seemed to highlight, is good quality chocolate hitting the mass market at reasonable prices. Hershey's, Mars, Kraft, and Nestle are all entering the premium market by creating lines of dark chocolate and improving the packaging. They're more expensive than a candy bar from your local magazine shop but way less than chocolate from La Maison Du Chocolate. At somewhere between $3.99-$10 for a bar or small package, I think this market is going to soar. These products make great gifts and you won't feel bad treating yourself either.

Kefi
CONTENT
Last night, we had dinner with my friend Bianca and her boyfriend Jeffrey. She suggested a Greek restaurant she frequents because of the delicious food at very reasonable prices. Bianca has great taste so I had no doubt that I would be happy with the food at Kefi.KefiThe place is packed even on a Tuesday night and the tables and chairs are squeezed in close together. It's pretty noisy and they have a cash only policy but the food makes you forget all that as you enjoy with delight.The bread brought to the table is just decent but the olive oil is fantastic. Bianca recommended 3 of her favorite appetizers for us to share. All 3 were amazing. The Warm Feta with Capers, Olives, Peppers, and Pita felt so complete with so many flavors blending so well together. The Grilled Octopus Bean Salad was so simple yet the octopus was so perfectly cooked. The Meatballs were very tender and sat in a pool of flavor from tomatoes, olives, and roasted garlic. I felt like I couldn't stop eating, going from one appetizer to another over and over again.My main course was the Branzino, served boneless but with both full sides of the fish, atop perfect fingerling potatoes (crisp outside and starchy inside), olives, caper berries (delicious!!), and grape tomatoes. A strong fruity olive oil was drizzled over the plate. Each ingredient was wonderful by itself and as a whole. Lon ordered the lamb chops which was served with a spinach and rice mixture. The lamb chops were decent but the rice mixture was extremely buttery and a bit too wet. We both agreed that my entree was better and that the appetizers were really superior.Since it was going so well, we decided to try a dessert. We shared the walnut cake served with a spiced ice cream. The cake was fresh and moist and surprisingly not too sweet. The spices were a bit overpowering aromatically.The big surprise was when the bill came. It was only $110 for 3 appetizers, 4 entrees, 1 dessert, and 2 glasses of wine. The food is made with high quality ingredients and much attention to flavor, balances, and seasonings. You don't normally get this kind of quality at these prices. I definitely recommend going. I would make a meal out of all appetizers but I wouldn't discourage ordering entrees.

Mountain Gorgonzola
CONTENT
I love tossing blue cheese into salads, especially with apples or pears. It is an amazing pairing. I'm always looking for different blues to try even though I've had my favorite (English Blackstick Blue) for years. I recently tried an Italian blue cheese called Mountain Gorgonzola and I was a bit disappointed. It was sharp yet lacked flavor and seemed very 1 dimensional. On FreshDirect's description chart Blue Rating (shown to the right), it looks to be pretty crumbly and is recommended in salads. I have to disagree. It's very sticky and gooey and does not crumble at all, making it very difficult to toss into a salad.If you're making a salad with blue cheese, I recommend English Stilton (safe for guests who may want something more mild), Great Hill Blue, Point Reyes Blue, Thomas Hoe Stevens Stilton (not attractive though), and of course my favorite, English Blackstick Blue.

Dekk
CONTENT
Dekk Dekk is a prototypical TriBeCa restaurant. The benches against the wall look like they were saved from trash collection and restored. Various walls receive projections of weird images that are half broken computer and half video game. The menu is sparse and slightly over priced. Now that I've got the bad out of the way, let's talk about the good: the food and the service.Justin opted for the brunch: $10 for eggs over easy, plated with what looked like hash, but was described as sausage (if I recall correctly). In a normal brunch context, that would be fine, because it'd be served with a drink, Justin paid $3 for his glass of OJ and then $3.50 for tea. I went for the lunch menu, selecting Organic Chicken Fricassee, after getting over the fact that it was $19, which admittedly was a struggle, I enjoyed the dish. Since fricassee is loosely defined as chicken (or any other white meat) served in a thickened sauce, it's hard to know what you're going to receive when you order it. Sometimes it has mushrooms, and so, while the menu didn't mention them, I discovered by asking that they included fungus. With the fungal element removed, I enjoyed the dish. It was accompanied by fingerling potatoes that were perfectly cooked and large shallots that were described as confit, but I found them to just be roasted. The gravy was not standard at all, it was barely thickened, and possibly with butter, but not cream or roux as would be expected. It was a bit fat-heavy, but quite tasty.Considering the heavy patron traffic coming in from OFFF, the waitstaff of 3-5 (or so) people were holding up fairly well. We had to ask for butter for the bread and sugar for the tea, and wait several minutes for our credit cards to be processed, but we enjoyed it and weren't in a rush anyway.Next time you're in the area, check out Dekk, it sounds like their film night is pretty fun.

Craftbar
CONTENT
I thoroughly enjoyed my meal at CraftbarCraftbar, the casual sister restaurant to Craft. It's a great central location to meet a friend (that friend being Chrissy) to catch up. You can have a full meal or snack on a wide selection of meats, cheeses, snacks, bruschettas, and of course choose from a large wine list.We shared an appetizer of Calamari with Arugula and Lemon Confit. It was possibly the best calamari dish I have ever had. Each piece was cooked perfectly and the flavor was intense. The acidic lemon confit and briny tenticles and rings fought in equal battle for dominance in my mouth.We opted for a a full dinner so I chose the entree of Bucatini with Roasted Tomatoes, Pancetta, and Clams. The pasta was cooked perfectly and pasta was flavored so well. The clams did nothing for the dish and were a tad over-cooked. I didn't mind or notice as much as I normally would because the rest of the pasta was so good. Again, the flavors just hit the mark. Chrissy ordered the Salmon. I didn't try it but it was nicely presented. It did look like it was cooked past medium rare (and they did not ask how she wanted it prepared).Although I thoroughly enjoyed the food, I can't help but feel like it was a bit pricey. The portion sizes were modest and the decor is simple but dark (which I guess is hip for some), but I guess it is a Tom Colicchio restaurant. I guess I would still go again.

Although we haven't made it to 'wichcraft in NYC yet, we did go to it in Las Vegas.  In fact since it was in our hotel (MGM Grand) I think we went 2-3 times. And Kasi actually like the fish at Craft the 2 times she went.  Guess Craftbar is a must visit.

Brunch at Punch!
CONTENT
Kasi recommended Punch Punch a long time ago but for some reason I never got around to going. Well, I should have gone earlier since I really enjoyed my brunch this past Sunday and since it's close by, it's the perfect safety spot. Punch isn't going to blow your mind but they hit a couple of key points for a good brunch place:1. Good Coffee - I hate letting a good brunch get spoiled by bad coffee. Punch not only serves a good tasting cup of coffee but refills your cup often.2. Good Quick Breads - Most brunch spots offer muffins or a banana bread, or biscuits while you wait. Right after being seated, we were greeted with a basket of warm (extra points) mini-muffins. I tried a banana mini muffin and it was a good texture with real banana flavor.3. Diverse Menu - Girls love brunch but that means we'll also get bored of standard brunch menus. It's always great to see some more innovative items or twists on the classics. For example, Punch lists a Lamb Burger, a Chorizo Hash, and Lobster Crawfish Roll (trying that next time).4. Cooks Meat to Correct Temperature - I ordered the Hanger Steak and Eggs. I asked for medium rare and that's what I got. Thank You! It came with 2 sunnyside eggs that were also perfect.5. Good Sides - My Home Fries were nicely seasoned, small dice potatoes, proportionate to my plate. Sara had some great sweet potato fries (will definitely get those next time) that were crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, and a wonderful example of the sweet and salty combo.6. Good Price - I always think of price in relation to the quality of the food, service, and decor. For $14.95 (includes coffee or tea, Bloody Mary, muffins, and entree), it's a steal. It's a nice looking place and the service was good.

Tour of San Francisco (part 2 of 2)

Baked Goods Tartine Bakery - Kristine recommended this great French Bakery Tartine Barkery. Lon had a good Buttermilk Scone with Currants and I tried their famous Morning Bun with Cinnamon and Orange. It's like a cinnamon bun in a way, but not as ooey and gooey. The dough is layered with more of a croissant texture and it has a hint of orange. They certainly deserve to be famous for it-it is delicious and definitely unique (hence my poor description). Lon didn't like their utter lack of service: customers get their own water and coffee and bus the tables. But hey, then you don't have to tip.The prices at Tartine are on par with Manhattan, so no savings for us there, but I would still go since the quality outshines any bakery in Manhattan. The coffee was bad (too acidic) but I plan to buy the Tartine Cookbook. That's how much I liked their pastry.Mexican (Again) Vinnie and Kristine swear by the taqueria in the Mission known as El Farolito El Farolito. I really liked the tortilla they used and the prices are unbeatable ($4.45 for a burrito that is 50% larger than Chipotle's). However, neither Lon or I enjoyed the flavor and thought the rice was particularly bad, tasting like over-cooked mush. Bad rice is sacrilege amongst Latinos. For the best burritos, we'll stick with Great Burrito, and since it's in Manhattan, it's slightly more convenient. If you do decide to try El Farolito, note that there are many stores with that name that are not necessarily related, although there is at least one other real location. Vinnie pointed out that \"The Lighthouse\" is something of a theme in SF.French We met up with Tom, a chef-friend of mine from Culinary School, that I haven't seen in four years. He recommended Cafe Bastille, a French Bistro on Beldon Place, a super cute, albeit touristy, alley of restaurants in downtown San Francisco Cafe Bastille. We shared a goat cheese in red pepper sauce appetizer while we waiting for Vinnie. I would've liked the goat cheese to be stronger, but I loved the red pepper emulsion sauce. For dinner, I ordered the Moules Mariniere with Pommes Frites and Lon ordered the Grilled Atlantic Salmon, but asked to leave the mushrooms out. All of my mussels were cold, but my fries were good. Lon's salmon was over-cooked, sitting in a pool of overly fatty balsamic reduction. The fish sat atop a brick of basil polenta that tasted like pure butter.Everyone else ordered meats, which looked better. Vinnie was happy with his Rack of Lamb; Kristine was happy with her Grilled New-York Steak, served Au Poivre style (but black pepper); and, Tom was happy with his Boudin Noir (blood sausage). For dessert, Vinnie ordered a Flourless Chocolate Cake that was too sweet and Kristine had a Chocolate Crepe that was really good, especially since it's so hard to find good crepes in NY. I suppose Cafe Bastille is more of a meat restaurant than seafood, but we likely wouldn't go back.American Breakfast We couldn't leave SF without meeting Bobby, a friend of Lon's who is also an ex-NYer. We sought out the wellknown breakfast place called Kate's Kitchen Kate's Kitchen. They do have a nice selection for breakfast menu, each item with a distinct twist, but I was unimpressed by the Flipped Egg Sandwich that seemed to be recommended on their menu. My entire dish was unseasoned and the home fries were flavorless. Bobby seemed to agree, since he aggressively seasoned his home fries in pace with me. The flipped egg sandwich was a just a regular sandwich with cheese and two over-easy eggs that weren't distinct. Lon had a pretty good multi-grain oatmeal with nuts and fruits, although the strawberries weren't so good.Airport Food After a mix-up at San Francisco International Airport (SFO), we had some time to kill. SFO does what I think all airports should do: instead of only offering national chain restaurants, they have outposts of famous SF restaurants. First we had a snack at a location of Emporio Rulli (there are several in the airport, and around SF). I had a nice coffee with a decent pastry, it was flaky with nuts, raisins, and some cream. We also shared a strawberry and mesclun salad with almonds and goat cheese. Again, the goat cheese was weak, but otherwise a good salad. Lon also got a foccaccia that the counter person told him was spinach, but it turned out to be pesto and too oily.Later in SFO, for dinner, we went to Perry's (only one in the airport: near gate 42, in Terminal 1, but others in SF) and ordered the Spaghetti with Meatballs and the Mahi Mahi. The meatballs were oddly spongey and the pasta was way over-cooked. The result was very watery sauce. The Mahi Mahi was a bit over-cooked, but still had a nice blackened flavor, although Lon thought it clashed with topping of tomatoes, capers, and overly-acidulated onions. The rice it came with was gross and Lon didn't touch the so-so vegetables since they included mushrooms. While not remotely good food, it was pretty good for an airport.We're happy to be home!

Great to see you guys, and to finally meet you, Jess!I agree with all of your comments on Kate's Kitchen - nothing to write home (or blog home) about.The very next day though I went to Chow on Church (not far from me) and had a really lovely breakfast - the homefries were cripsy and well seasoned, the omlette fluffy and delicate. The coffee, decent. Should've taken you guys there, but I never thought of it as a breakfast place...oh well, there's always next time.As for coffee, you must be more sensitive to acidity than I (or maybe I like it or something) because I like the coffee at Tartine (though I usually get an Americano or some sort of espresso based drink)take care and hope to see you guys again kisoon,bobby

Tour of San Francisco (part 1 of 2)
CONTENT
The trip to California was truly wonderful. In addition to completing the marathon that I've been writing about for months, I had great coffee and many other fine meals.Chinese On Saturday, the day before the marathon, the goal was to not to do too much. So we just walked to Chinatown, a few short blocks from where we stayed: The Grand Hyatt in Union Square, The Grand Hyatt for lunch. We chose a second floor, dim sum restaurant: Kan's Restaurant Kan's Restaurant. The food was mediocre, but the service was better than most restaurants in NYC's Chinatown. Some of the food was cold and some was too oily, but a few shrimp dishes were good. and our specially-ordered Chinese broccoli was perfect. The crystal shrimp dumplings and the shrimp wrapped in the flat white noodle both had great shrimp wrapped in so-so skin.Mexican After the marathon, Lon asked the concierge for a restaurant recommendation. The concierge was everything except helpful. So we wandered around Union Square, until we found El Sotano, a great Mexican bar/restaurant, up a steep hill, near our hotel El Sotano. We were in love after just the chips and salsa. The salsa was homemade and had a rich (almost French-buttery-sauce) texture and good spice. Then came our entrees: Lon had the Green Monster Enchilada, two enchiladas filled with grilled chicken breast and covered in a citrus-flavored salsa verde and served with a side of seasoned black beans and rice. I had the Chile Relleno, a large poblano pepper filled with white cheese, battered, and deep fried. It was served aside refried pinto beans and rice.Aside from loving the food, we were so impressed with the one women show. The hostess/waitress/bartender was tending over several customers flawlessly. She was seating people, taking orders, bussing tables, working the bar, taking payments, etc. all by herself, and at full speed. I guess that's why this place was half full, even at 3pm.French Vietnamese For the last few days, we stayed at our friends' (Kristine and Vinnie) place. When we arrived Monday evening, Kristine set out a great cheese and fruit plate for us. SF does have amazing strawberries and tomatoes. The cheese selection included a buttery Pecorino that Vinnie liked, a subtley-flavored Roquefort, and a locally-produced triple creme that Kris' mom had recommended from Point Reyes Farmstead Cheese Company.After some chatting, we headed out for a nearby dinner at Tao Cafe, a French Vietnamese place Tao Cafe. The complimentary pickled vegetables were nicely presented and very tasty. We chose to eat family style, so that we could try several dishes. The pho did not have the standard rare beef slices I love, but still offered a nice flavor, which we all enjoyed. Second we shared a perfectly prepared Lemongrass-crusted bass fillet, topped with a light coconut-sauce, and served aside carmelized plantain. It was a bit small for us to share, but Lon, in particular, loved this dish. Kris even sampled it, even though she doesn't care much for bass.Our next two dishes were both from the \"Oodles of Noodles\" menu section: Sauteed, Minced Beef, which was Kris' favorite dish and Vietnamese Confit of Duck Leg, which was Vin's favorite dish. Both plates were licked clean. It was relatively inexpensive, and an enjoyable experience with great friends.Seafood SF is famous for its Fisherman's Wharf, the west coast equivalent of NY's South Street Seaport. A tourist trap by any other name is still a tourist trap, but that doesn't mean you can't find good eats.Just off the main strip (Jefferson Street), there's a great row of fish stands along Taylor Street Fish Stands on Taylor, where you can buy fresh shellfish. Some of these stands include Guardino's, The Crab Station, Sabella & La Torre, and Nicks. While we didn't try all of them, they are all the same formula: street stand with great, simple, cooked seafood: plain, in salads, or in sandwiches, backed by a larger sit-down restaurant. Since we were meeting my friend Anna for lunch, we picked one at random and just tried a small cup of crab meat, served with cocktail sauce and a lemon wedge. Nothing beats really fresh shellfish in my book. I would eat shellfish every day if I lived near this source.Also situated on Fisherman's Wharf is one location of the famous Boudin Bakery Boudin Bakery at Fishermans Wharf, known for their San Francisco Sourdough. Lon had told me that I must try the Boudin Sourdough Bread Bowl, which he had years ago so I did. The New England Clam Chowder was very good, but the sourdough was phenomenal! Anna's French Onion Soup looked really good and she liked it. But the real winner, surprisingly, was Lon's Cioppino. It was hands down the best either of us had ever tasted. The super large crab half was delicious; all of the seafood (calamari, mussels, fish, and shrimp) was perfectly cooked; and the flavors sank in to each piece. The bowl really put the Wild Salmon Cioppino to shame.Also, while in the area, we walked over to Ghiradelli Square. I didn't feel like there was that much to see in the area. Sure there is a Ghiradelli Cafe and some other shops, but nothing too fabulous, as Lon says, \"To make the stairs worthwhile\". There is a new wine (and some gourmet foods) store called Cellar 360 that is designed nicely. And the re is some construction happening in the area: they are currently putting up new condos for those chocolate lovers who'd like to live in \"Cocoa Towers\".

San Francisco Coffee
CONTENT
So sorry that we haven't blogged in a while but we were away in San Francisco for the Nike Women's Marathon. Right after the marathon was over, we started our eating marathon. More to come later (Lon and I will put it together this weekend) but just a little bit since you've been waiting...San Francisco is proud of their coffee. The two places that several people recommended were Philz Coffee Philz Coffee - Castro and Blue Bottle Coffee Co. Blue Bottle Coffee. Both had great staff who were proud of their product. Both made each cup to order individually. Even though we went to Philz's newest location, Blue Bottle looks cooler: just a counter behind a garage door with no seats but a small ledge where three people could place cups. But in terms of coffee, Philz wins by a landslide. I had their Tesora (house blend), which was absolutely delicious. The barista asks you how you want it and makes it for you with brown sugar and cream.I have never tasted a more perfect coffee than Philz's and I'm so sad I didn't get to have another cup before leaving.

Lon and I had Sunday brunch at Society Cafe Society Cafe. The slightly artsy cafe has average food, terribly slow service (I eventually got up to get my own menu.), at regular Manhattan prices. No discount for being in Harlem which I expected. I had the Stuffed French Toast which was too soggy but otherwise pretty good. Lon's Turkey Club came with cheese (not listed on the menu) which he did not want and the salad greens were not dressed. The ingredients were fresh and the portion sizes were nice but we wouldn't go again.

Stand

There really aren't any burger joints in our neighborhood so we're glad that Stand Stand opened up. It's a big plus when you actually get a medium rare burger when you order one. The ingredients are fresh and everything is made to order. So yes, I like the piping hot fries. They're nice and crispy and well salted. By the way, the small order is plenty for two people. I couldn't really taste the cheddar in my cheeseburger but I do like the shredded lettuce and onions they top the their burgers with. Plus, they use good buns. Stand also does a good job with options for diners who don't want burgers: turkey burgers, chicken burger, salmon burgers, veggie burgers, and salads. Lon didn't like they're turkey burger as much as a deli turkey burger (also too much mayo) but liked the bun also. They haven't made my favorites list but it's still a place I would go back to.This great pic is from a blog called A Hamburger Today. I disagree with his thoughts on the bun but the onion rings did look good.

Honeycrisp
CONTENT
Bless the University of Minnesota for crossing the Macoun Apple with the Honeygold Apple to make my favorite apple, the Honeycrisp. It's the perfect name for a super crisp apple that tastes like honey (with the perfect balance of tartness). It's also an attractive apple, a vibrant red and golden yellow.Unfortunately, you won't see Honeycrisps all year round. They are harvested from Sept 15 to Oct 10th in Minnesota so right now you'll find them in the Union Square Farmer's Market and your local Whole Foods. The good news is that they store in refrigeration for 6 months so stock up!Also note that they are quite expensive, up to 2x as expensive as other apples. To me, it's worth it.

I had a honeycrisp for the first time last week and was totally obsessed about it. So good but I'm kind of allergic to apples so my mouth and throat go itchy but it was worth it. Fuji apples also have a similar sweetness, more tart but I love the crispness of them.

Shishito Peppers
CONTENT
As I walked through the farmer's market in Union Square, I was reminded of these little Shishito Peppers and had to buy some. There is a Korean stand, usually located at the North side of the park (around where Barnes & Nobles is) that sells these little Japanese Peppers. Sometimes they prepare some for patrons to try in my favorite simple method, just blistered in a little bit of oil and sprinkled with some coarse salt. You can pop these mild peppers right into your mouth and I can eat a large bowl of them.I did a quick google search and I'm surprised that these little peppers have gotten a lot of press in the blogosphere already. A So Cal blogger gives a good description and another NYC blogger tells us where you can get it, fresh or already prepared. So if you need one more positive review to try them, here's mine: They are yummy!

Pams Hams
CONTENT
It was my friend Xiu-Jing's birthday and we were throwing her a little party on our patio. The centerpiece was a ham from Pams-Hams. We weren't sure what to expect from a mail order , glazed ham, destined to be defrosted in the fridge and then served at room temperature. So, we were happy when several guests commented about how good the ham was. I have to agree. Pam does make a good ham and it's perfect for a party.The ham comes pre-sliced (spiral-style), still attached to the bone so that it makes a great presentation piece and no skill is required. Each person can just pull a piece off whenever they want it. You can also get sides from Pams-Hams or you can make sides, or have a potluck where friends just bring sides. At $42.99 for the half ham (about 8.5 pounds), we think it's a great value!! 11 people only ate about half of it so everyone was happy they got to take some home. This is right inline with Pam's serving recommendation (she says 21 people when served in a large buffet style).The ham is supposedly low-carb, although the web site doesn't seem to list how so. It tasted wonderful and we simply garnished with some fresh grilled pineapple.I know you still want to know what else I made so... Xiu-Jing requested the Mexican Cornbread (which I made with Pepper Jack instead of Monterey this time) and the Mini Fish Tacos, which she saw pictures of from my mom's birthday dinner. I also made a salmon spread (where I used dill instead of green onion and Kirkland Canned Salmon instead of fresh) served with crackers and a salad of arugula, tomato, and Cucumber with a balsamic dressing. I couldn't resist throwing in a simple dish of peas (sauteed with onion and garlic) since peas and ham were made for each other.Angie made a Grape Tomato Salad with Feta. Becky made a Kimchee Fried Rice. Sheryl made a Potato Gratinee. Winnie made her classic Mac 'n' Cheese. Tammy made a Cajun Egg Salad and Xiu brought Banana Pudding from Buttercup. By the way, I love their banana pudding but don't care for their cupcakes.Great food and great company! That's what my life is all about!Lots more pictures on the Flickr set.

Finger Tips and Taste Buds
CONTENT
What restaurants do you want to try? Jessica and I have a list of restaurants that we'd love to go to; it's wide ranging from famed Gramercy Tavern to simple recommendations from friends like Strip House. How do you decide where you'd like to eat, in the distant future for special occasions, or even for any ole meal? Most of us get ideas from friends and co-workers, but, how do you know which recommendations to trust? A while back Jessica came up with a term that I love and now use to describe people with trustworthy taste in food: \"Taste Buds\".Wikipedia tells us that \"taste buds are small structures on the upper surface of the tongue, soft palate, and epiglottis that provide information about the taste of food being eaten.\" Implied in that definition is that we trust our taste buds -- if our tongue likes a food, usually, so do we. Well, Jessica tells us that Taste Buds are friends on the cutting edge of food that provide information about the taste of food being eaten. And if these buds like a food, usually, so do we.Do you think about who your taste buds are? I do. I think about which of my acquaintances seem to pay attention to food and understand it. That way when I receive recommendations, I know which to trust.But when I think about a dining experience, it's not just about the food; after all, I can cook a lot of the food at restaurants to equal or better quality. I also pay special attention to the overall experience, particularly service and decor. So, I also think about which of my acquaintances are trustworthy judges of environment. Wikipedia also tells us that \"...the fingertips possess the highest concentration of touch receptors... making them extremely sensitive... Fingers are thus commonly used as sensory probes to ascertain properties of objects encountered in the world...\" So I'll term the trustworthy people as providing Finger \"Tips\", because they are my sensory probes, other than taste.Interestingly, just as in my body, friendly Finger Tips and Taste Buds are not necessarily found in the same acquaintance. Some people are phenomenal gauges of experience and poor judges of food; and vice versa for other people. In some cases, there are external limitations. For instance some people keep kosher, while others are vegan and vegetarian.Think about who your finger tips and taste buds are, let us know if you have any funny stories about discovering who is who.

Plantains
CONTENT
I love plantains!! They can be cooked at different stages and in different ways but are most commonly fried. The green ones fried are called Tostones and the riper yellow ones with some browning are made into Maduros. As Tostones, the plantains taste more like thick plantain chips and are delicious with just a little salt. At the riper stage, the plantains taste sweeter and come out much softer (unlike chips) even when prepared virtually the same way. These are called Maduros and are a favorite of mine.I wanted to figure out if there was a healthier way of making them so that I didn't have to eat all that oil. My Peruvian friend James told me that he just throws them on his grill with the skins on and when they're ready, the skins will split. So yesterday I decided to try his concept in the oven. I put the whole plantain, skin on, in a 400 degree oven. It was a very large plantain and it took about 30 min. I turned it over once in the middle. As he said, it split when ready and oh my god, it was delicious! Just peel the skin off and serve. You won't miss the oil at all. YUM!

Doozo
CONTENT
I've been to Doozo Doozomany many years ago and I remembered it as pretty good Japanese food for reasonable prices. Boy has time changed things. It's now one of those cheap Japanese places where you get just what you pay for, cheap sushi. The sushi was flavorless and the color of this fish looked faded. The rolls were slightly better but I can't say much for the service. We were the only people eating lunch there when we ordered and the waitress gave me the miso soup instead of the salad (which I asked for). I didn't bother changing it. They do offer very cheap bento boxes for lunch (starting at $6.95) but when you want to go cheap, don't do sushi. I wouldn't recommend eating at Doozo.

We had the Bulgolgi (thinly sliced Korean BBQ beef), Soon Doo Boo Chi Gae (tofu casserole with seafood), and Ojinguh Bokum (sauteed squid and vegetables with noodles in a spicy sauce). Everything was decent but I would still pay a little more to eat at Seoul Garden or Chung Moo Ro. The side dishes were also just ok and they gave a bit less in variety. Lon was also grossed out by the sticky floors.

Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough Cheesecake
CONTENT
Kasi and Stephen stopped by to have a birthday dinner for Kasi. I asked Kasi what she'd like to eat and her answer: Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough Cheesecake! 'nuff said. I've made this particular cake before (maybe once or twice) and tastes wonderful. However, I don't often go for this recipe because it needs to be modified to cook correctly, and it has some extra steps that don't add enough value for my taste.The recipe comes from \"Star Pooley\" as posted on AllRecipes and, as I mentioned, some changes are necessary, just like the last cheesecake recipe I found on AllRecipes -- the one for apple and maple.First of all, Star recommends blind baking the crust. I'm not a fan. But just to be near the recipe I do it for half the time, that is MORE than enough and really superfluous.Second, Star's recipe scale for cookie dough creates at least twice as much as necessary for this cake. And because it's not actually cookie dough (there are no eggs in it), you can't bake off the rest. Star suggests dropping the cookie dough evenly over the entire top of the cake. Maybe if I did that it would be the right amount, but I doubt it. I usually drop in about nine balls of two tablespoons each. The first eight are symmetrically positioned around the outside (about half an inch from the edge). And the ninth is in the center. This puts 1.125 cups of cookie dough into the cake!Finally, Star's cooking recommendations go against my personal beliefs. Star suggests cooking for 40 minutes at 350 deg F then pouring the icing over the hot cake. Oy! My oven, which is the best we could buy (pro-sumer Bluestar) cooks hotter and more evenly than any other I've used. And therefore I only cook cheesecakes for 50 minutes at 350 deg F. In any other, I always do 55 or 60 minutes. Then, and this is critical for ALL CHEESCAKES, do not move the cake. Do the jiggle test (check to make sure it has set around the edges and jiggles in the center), turn off the oven, and leave the oven door open about two inches for an hour. Then you can remove the cake, no sooner.I'm also against icing a warm cake, but in this case I went half way. I let it cool on the counter another hour, then I iced it and let it cool again for another hour before the fridge. This time I came up with a great way of cooling it in the fridge. Instead of covering with saran wrap, which is very close to the cake surface and accumulates a lot of condensation, I used a large cake cover (from a cake carrier). After two hours I wiped down the inside and covered it again. The next day, I replaced it with saran. No water on my cake!Everyone loves this cake, and it was worth fighting with the recipe to make it. Try it out yourself and let me know how it goes...More pictures on Flickr.

Generally, most proteins were quite good but the carb's stunk and that didn't make sense to me since I would expect them to want to encourage people to eat more of the carbohydrate items that are cheaper and more filling.Since I tried almost everything, you don't have to:Try:Don't Try:Try, if you feel like it:Items I didn't try:I'm sure I'm forgetting a lot but this list will give you a head start.

I'm glad I finally found another good place in K-town. I've been sticking to Seoul Garden especially for Soon Dubu (Tofu Casserole). Becky introduced me to Choong Moo Ro Choong Moo Ro for lunch and I was surprised to find that they had an excellent Soon Dubu. It was rich in flavor with a nice large clam in it, served in a stone pot on something to keep it hot. I love when food is served hot and stays hot!Becky ordered the Duk Mondoo Guk (Dumpling and Rice Cake Soup). The soup had a good flavor but the dumpling was slightly over-cooked. The Pa-chan (small side dishes) were very good and often one of the main criteria a Korean restaurant it judged on. Some were a bit over-salted but I was generally very happy with it. The kimchi was good. There was a octopus pa-chan I enjoyed, and of course bean sprouts.Choong Moo Ro seemed to have a pretty extensive menu so I'd definitely like to go back with a larger group. It also has a slightly nicer decor than Seoul Garden so feel free to take some out-of-town guests.

They are associated with one location in Midtown Ariyoshi Midtown according to their business card.Ariyoshi has prices like your average neighborhood Japanese restaurant but really takes quality seriously. The attention to detail is impressive in every way. The flavors are well thought out and delicate. The presentation is a study in what Japanese food is all about. We ordered the Sashimi platter which was architected beautifully with very fresh fish. Both of us kept talking about how good it was for such average prices. We also ordered a seafood stone BBQ set which included shrimp, scallops, white tuna, pepper, and three types of mushroom and a little stone grill. At first I thought it wasn't going to cook the food since the flame looked so light but everything came out perfectly. The two sauces were also quite good. One sesame and one similar to a tempura dipping sauce. Lon and I were truly both impressed.The menu is huge so I can't wait to visit this place again and again to try everything else.

Extending Flavors into a Sauce
CONTENT
Every now and then when we order in food, we get a dipping sauce that has great flavor, sometimes from the most unlikely places. Lately we've been ordering frequently from Sammy's Noodle Shop Sammy's Noodle Shop. Their noodle soups are some of the best in the area, and their dumplings are quite tasty as well. Left over from a recent order was the dipping sauce for the dumplings. It's a fairly standard dipping sauce for dumplings. Its strong flavors include sugar (or possibly mirin), ginger, and garlic. I really wanted it as a full fledged sauce.If you de-construct a sauce into its most basic components, there are the aromatics in the base, such as garlic, onions, carrots, shallots (especially if the sauce will be French); there is a body, such as stock, wine, or even just water; there are seasonings, such as herbs and spices; and there is a thickener, such as butter, cream, or corn starch. So, once you've identified the components, you can build a sauce from just about anything. And that's what I did for dinner last night.I started sauteeing diced onion, garlic, and ginger in a tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil. Then I added some canned salmon. After a few minutes, I poured on the left over dipping sauce, which was about two tablespoons. I also refilled that little container with water and added that. After cooking down for two minutes, I thickened with a corn starch slurry, which is most appropriate for Chinese flavors. After some medium heat and nice thickening action, I removed it from the heat, tossed in some fresh cilantro and served over re-steamed rice (also left over). It was fantastic!

Hummus Place

Hummus Place is up to three locations now, East Village Hummus Place-EV, West Village Hummus Place-WV, and the Upper West Side Hummus Place-UWS. While everyone is raving about the hummus, I'd like to turn the spotlight onto their pita! The hummus is very good, but the pita is the best pita in NYC.The texture is incredible. I like their green sauce too.

I love love love Hummus Place. I agree about the pita and green sauce as well. They are absolutely delicious. I've only been to the one in the EV and one of the female servers knows me and Scott now and is always really nice. They actually do private events so I'd love to have a birthday party or something there one day. Maybe they can make me a hummus path that I can roll around in.

Fresh Direct Challah
CONTENT
We've written about Fresh Direct breads before but we just tried the Fresh Direct frozen Challah and thought we have to give out the warning. Although the texture is quite impressive for a once frozen bread, made ready by just defrosting on your counter, there is an odd taste that makes it pretty undesirable. At $3.99 for an 11oz, there isn't even a price incentive. If you don't have a local bakery that makes a good Challah, I suggest getting Zomick's Challah which is available at several supermarkets.

Watch Out Kitchenaid!
CONTENT
Cuisinart has a new stand mixer, the Cuisinart SM-70 . With a 7 quart capacity and 1000 Watt motor it seems (can't verify since I haven't tried it - Hint Hint Cuisinart if you want to send me one) to outshine my Kitchenaid Professional Six series. While I would really appreciate the larger capacity, I have never felt like I needed more power. You can get most of the same accessories (but no ice cream maker) but the most attractive feature is the tilt-back that the Kitchenaid does not have. Unfortunately, it doesn't come in all the fun colors, just white and chrome. It retails for about $499 on Amazon right now which is about $50 more than the Kitchenaid Professional Six. If I didn't already have a very good stand mixer, this would go on the top of my wish list.

Fresh Dining
CONTENT
Fresh Direct has started a new section called Fresh Dining. It is a collection of portable meals that can be microwaved in under 4 minutes. The newest line is Presto Italiano, created by Chef Tina Bourbeau. We tried 2 flavors, the Parmesan Meatballs with Mezzi Rigatoni and Basil and the Shrimp Fettuccine with Mint, Peas, and Berkshire Bacon.I enjoyed the meatball meal more. The meatballs were tender and the sauce had a good flavor. The Shrimp meal was way too greasy and the bacon overpowered the rest of the pasta. However, the fetuccini was cooked perfectly and the rigatoni was a bit too soft.Overall, the Presto Italiano meals were leaps and bounds better than the standard microwave dinner. They look just like real food and taste like freshly made food. The catch is that they are also leaps and bounds more expensive. At $8.99 each, the portion size is not large enough for me personally (maybe lunch but not dinner), yet the calorie and fat content is disproportionately high. They do have another line called Fresh & Simple where they are all 500 calories or less but I haven't tasted any so I don't know how good they are.

Mom's Birthday Dinner
CONTENT
We wanted to take my mom out to a fancy restaurant for her birthday, but she asked us to cook instead. My mom is my biggest fan as a chef, which of course makes it even more fun for me. Lon and I decided on a Latin-inspired menu.The menu:For the Picadillo Phyllo Triangles, Lon made the Picadillo. First he sauteed a large yellow onion (diced) and five diced garlic cloves in a third cup of olive oil plus plenty of kosher salt and black pepper. Once soft, he added the ground beef and six bay leaves, breaking up the meat as it cooked. Once the meat was almost cooked, he carmelized half a can of tomato paste, then deglazed with red wine vinegar. To finish he cooked it down (for about 30 minuites) with chopped capers (and brine), diced tomatoes, plenty of chili powder and cayenne powder.I had some left over maduros and store-bought phyllo dough. To assemble, cut the phyllo into approximately 2-inch strips. Lay one strip down and brush with melted butter. Lay another strip on top and brush with butter. Lay the 3rd strip on top and then place a little piece of maduros and a little picadillo at one end. Fold over to make a triangle shape and roll triangle over triangle till you reach the end. Brush a little melted butter at the end to stick it to the triangle. I made the triangles the day before and froze them. To serve, bake at 375 degrees F for 15 minutes.The Baja Fish Tacos is one of my favorite ideas ever. The presentation is adorable and all the ingredients can be prepared the day before and assembled before serving. Lon marinated swordfish (for about 90 minutes) in a dressing made of freshly-squeezed grapefruit juice, olive oil, diced garlic, ground onion, salt, pepper, cayenne powder, and ancho chili powder. The fish is grilled, cooled, and cut into small dice. I made a Spicy Mango Salsa (1/2 the recipe) with only half the amount of ginger. We bought Tostitos Baked Scoops. To assemble, put a little fish in each cup and top with salsa, serve immediately.The Jicama and Orange Salad was inspired by a recipe I saw in Rick Bayless's cookbook, Mexican Kitchen. He makes a Jicama appetizer that sounds great but uses lime juice. My mom is allergic to lemon and lime so I decided to make a salad with most of the ingredients and make my own cumin dressing. The salad base was baby spinach, topped with jicama, mineola oranges, radishes, and cucumbers. My dressing (sorry I didn't measure quantities) is made with white balsamic, minced garlic, whole grain mustard, cumin, and olive oil. The salad was very refreshing and almost a palate cleanser.The paella, is loosely based on a recipe, but each time Lon makes it, it's a bit different. We've written extensively about the recipe, and even provided tips. This time, we used a new chorizo brand, that we picked up from Murray's Cheese Shop, it was from Rioja and was a bit smokier than most American-made chorizo. We also limited the seafood to clams and shrimp, and used more chicken and chorizo, to round out the balance of proteins.The Triple Devil's Food Cake recipe can be found in The Cake Bible, by Rose Levy Beranbaum. I used a recipe for the cream cheese frosting but reduced the sugar by almost 25%. The cake itself had a light, bouncy texture, which melted in our mouths. I pressed sliced almonds on to the side to decorate the cake -- everyone loved it.For more pictures of our fiesta, check our the Flickr set.

The fish tacos sound right up Stephen's alley. By the way, if anyone finds themselves craving fish tacos in Maui we had a great meal at Jawz Tacos. Although the chips (which you pay for) were greasy and hard it was fun to try the some of the ~12 different salsas at the salsa bar.   http://www.jawzfishtacos.com/index.htm

Dusk Lounge to Midnight Pizza Bar
CONTENT
We started the night at Dusk Lounge, Dusk Loungewhich was a good place to catch up with a friend from out of town. It was quiet enough to talk AND HEAR and you could easily grab seats. The bartender was friendly and it was just a no pressure environment with some interesting quirks. They have a wall of napkin doodlings from a contest they have on Tuesday nights called Napkin Idol and the bathrooms have one way mirrors. I know; old new these days.The six of us were getting hungry so we headed out in search of food and landed at Pizza Bar Pizza Bar. It was surprisingly good food for bar food. It's no Numero 28 but the pizza hits the spot for a midnight snack. It's pizza so it still satisfies the late night craving but it's super thin so it's not too heavy. I tried the Tomato, Basil, Mozzarella and the Mushroom with Truffle Oil pizzas. As usual in pizza, I preferred the plain and the mushroom was also a white pizza and I prefer with sauce. Lon had a meatball sandwich that had tender meatballs on a good ciabatta but it desperately needed more sauce. We also got some Pesto Fries which were nice and crispy with just the right amount pesto. I don't think I would go to Pizza Bar during regular hours where I could select any restaurant but at midnight, it's a good choice.

An Eventful Night Out
CONTENT
As my regular readers know, I run as part of Team in Training, where we raise money for The Leukemia and Lymphoma Society. So last night, I had a fund raiser at Vesta, Vesta a bar/lounge with a generous owner and fantastic staff. They gave us half-priced drinks, owners and staff donated, and everyone raved about how nice they were. Thanks to everyone who came out!! If you weren't able to come, you can still donate!Time to talk about food: We started with some food at Vesta. They got it from Home on Eighth Home on Eightha Chinese place across the street. There was some sesame chicken, sweet and sour chicken, fried rice, and chicken wings. All average take-out food.After the event wrapped up, Xiu, Andy, and I wanted Dinner while Winnie and Sara went straight to more drinking at 40/40 Club 40/40 Club. We passed by Hill Country, Hill Country a fairly new BBQ place. It was packed pretty late in the evening so we were enticed to try it. We asked how long it would take to seat and the hostess said 5 minutes. We took a seat at the bar and soon someone was coming around offering free wings, slow smoked with a lightly sweetened sauce. They were pretty good so I was getting excited about dinner but we noticed something strange - their set-up. After you wait for seating, you then wait on another line to order your food, then wait for the food to be made, and take it back to your table yourself. We didn't mind the getting the food yourself part but the line was quite long and we weren't even seated yet (you have to be seated before you can wait on the order food line). We finally agreed to leave and search for food elsewhere but I'll be back.We kept walking South and Andy suggested Chat 'N' Chew Chat 'N' Chewas we talked about food all the way there. Andy and Xiu shared a TV Dinner - chicken fried steak with mashed potatoes. I took a risk and ordered a special, Maryland Lump Crab Cake with French Fries. I was pleasantly surprised by the large crab cake that was all meat and very little filler. It came with an ok tarter sauce and a heavily mayo-ed cole salw. Unfortunately the fries were over-cooked (which is the opposite of the usual problem for most places). Andy called it carbon fries.It was a night of greasy food!

I've been to the Balducci's Balducci's on West 14th Street several times and never noticed that they have a balcony seating area. I was introduced to it by Balducci's Regional Catering Director Marissa Drago. I met her at a friend's event that she was catering where the shrimp was really amazing.So I met with Marissa where she showed me this great little space overlooking the rest of the store. It's great for a quick no hassle meal or snack. You could just meet a friend for a coffee or you can even rent the space for a little party. (Call Marissa at 212-741-3700 and she'll hook you up!)Marissa also told me that Balducci's gets fresh mozzarella delivered each morning from an Italian maker who makes it exclusively for Balducci's.

East Ocean Palace

When you want some good dim sum, you have to go to Queens these days. The places in Chinatown just don't have the same quality and freshness. Yesterday, we had a family gathering at East Ocean Palace East Ocean Palace with some cousins visiting from Maryland and they kept raving about how good the dim sum was. It was indeed, with one exception. The sticky rice (the one that comes in a bowl, not the one wrapped in leaves) was undercooked so it was very hard. Everything else was yummy and a few items were really fantastic. The shrimp ball coated in sticky rice and the watercress and shrimp Shu Mai are must haves. We also ordered a Beef Chow Mein and it was excellent. If you haven't tried dim sum yet, definitely go and try this place. Make sure you have a large group (the more people you have, the more items you get to try) and go on a weekend between 11am - 2pm.

Route 11 makes potato chips called Mama Zuma's Revenge. The habanero potato chips are well named since the heat lasts for quite some time after eating them and that makes for some good revenge, but flavor wise, they lack potential. This ones not going in my pantry.However, a few weeks ago we tried some of Trader Joe's own line of potato chips and they were quite good. A blogger from San Francisco has a tasty suggestion for the Sesame & Ginger Potato Chips.

It's a Dominican Thing?
CONTENT
With a name like, It's a Dominican ThingIt's a Dominican Thing, you really expect the restaurant to represent authentic Dominican food. Since I'm not Dominican, I can't make any claims that I'm sure of what Dominican food should taste like but I sure hope tonight's dinner is not. I've had Dominican food before and enjoyed it very much but tonight's dinner was a big disappointment.We split the Un \"Chin\" de todo, a sampler platter of all the appetizers, highly recommended by our waiter. The croquetas de platano (sweet plantain and beef croquette) was the only one we actually liked and there was only one on the plate when everything else came in pairs. The wings and the Kipes (ground beef and wheat balls) were ok. The bollitos (cassava stuffed with beef) was tasteless. The cod fish fritters tasted like fried dough. Where was the cod? The fried Dominican cheese shouldn't have been fried. It just made the exterior taste like it was covered in a layer of plastic. The empanadas were tiny and barely had filling in them and now that I'm looking at the menu again, I realized that we didn't get the pasteles.Since we got this big sampler platter, Lon and I both got salad entrees. I got one with shrimp and he got one with chicken. Both were on a bed of cabbage salad. My shrimp were actually cooked perfectly but Lon's chicken was dry and very salty.For two people who usually clean our plates, there was a lot left over, and we weren't full. It was a pretty bad dining experience for us but don't worry, we don't think it's a Dominican thing.

Addicted to this Bird

Lon and I recently tried a new cereal by Barbara's Bakery called Puffins, named after a black and white bird called the Puffin. We tried the Puffins Peanut Butter and now we're totally hooked. It comes in 3 more flavors and they're 100% natural, low fat, wheat free, dairy free, and Kosher. I think that means pretty much anyone can try it (except those allergic to corn and/or nuts) and we recommend that you do! It's available online here, if you can't find it in your local grocery store.

A Versatile Sauce for Fish
CONTENT
We went to Chatham Square Restaurant Chatham Square Restaurantfor Dim Sum today. It was average for Chinatown Dim Sum, which has declined in the last few years. Dim Sum in Flushing is better. The good thing about any meal in Chinatown is that you get to do some great shopping afterwards. We picked up a 1 1/2 pound swordfish steak, along with lots of other goodies.We grilled the swordfish steak (6 min on one side, 3-4 min on the other, here is a close-up) and I made a sauce that really impressed Lon. If you don't like Swordfish, the sauce could easily be served on salmon, a fried fish (like Skate, Tilapia, Catfish, any...), or even Sea Scallops. It's easy too! Just mix all of these ingredients together and spoon on top of fish.This makes enough for 4 servings:

A New Favorite - Maurizio
CONTENT
With a party of 14, I always get nervous. Even restaurants that are usually pretty good start to falter when they have to plate for 8 or more at a time. We've been to Maurizio Trattoria Maurizio Trattoriabefore and praised there food so we were hoping they could hold up under the pressure. I watched in amazement as all the appetizers were served at the same time and then all the entrees. Even more impressive for a large party is having all the meats and seafoods cooked to the correct temperatures. Nothing over-done, nothing under, perfect seared tuna, quail, steak, chilean sea bass, fish stew, etc. They make their own fresh pasta which is delicious and have a long list of specials that really changes. It's a place you could really go to often and feel like your eating somewhere new. They also make their own desserts which are very good (except for the creme brulee) and the coffee is good too! The service was good and the prices suit the quality you get, and the portions are a little bigger than expected. I have to wonder if I should let out one of NYC's best kept secrets.

The service was mostly good - although Kasi felt the water slacked off after the entrees were removed.  However, we probably would not go back.  Stephen found the veal bolognese tortelli gummy and the portion a bit small.  He did enjoy Keith's octopus appetizer quite a bit.

I just had lunch at Burger Heaven Burger Heaven where the salad was average and so was the service. Nothing about the place seems memorable except their Sweet Potato Fries. I know, I know. I didn't even try a burger, but I had read some unimpressive reviews about their burgers and I wasn't in the mood to regret my lunch. Things like a bad burger, pizza, or french fries will bother me all day!!As we walked towards our seats, I spotted their sweet potato fries. What caught me eye was that they were thin cut fries, not the steak fries size you usually see for sweet potato fries. I had to try it! While it wasn't mind blowing, they were really good, something I'd like to eat again. Why haven't other places caught on? Cut the sweet potato into thinner slices!! Otherwise they get soggy and gross. They also had a light coating kinda like Burger King fries, again helping with maintaining the crispiness. Go Sweet Potato Fries!

D'Artagnan Duck Breast

Last Friday, we enjoyed a great chicken from D'Artagnan; and yesterday we tried their marinated duck breast. It is a great product for those who have no idea how to cook and want duck for dinner.The duck breast arrives de-boned, already marinated in a Mediterranean sauce, ready to be cooked. Of the three cooking options, I chose the broiler method, which is easiest: broil for 20 minutes and serve.The cooked product looks really nice. It came out a perfect medium rare. We served it along with parsley rice and steamed veggies. The duck meat is tougher than we expected, so it's not a product Lon or I would buy. But again, it's certainly good for non-cooks.For more images of the duck and of dinner, check out the Flickr set.

Italian Wedding Soup
CONTENT
A week ago my mom picked up four pounds of lamb for me at a butcher in Long Island. Because he butchered an 8-pound piece for me, I ended up with two beautiful shanks. After attending my cousin Riva's wedding last night, and because our brunch plans fell apart, AND (for the real reason) because Jessica wasn't feeling well, I decided to make some lamb stock, which would end up in homemade (the best kind) Italian Wedding Soup.First I sauteed the shanks with salt and pepper in extra virgin olive oil in a large stock pot. I let them go for a good 15 minutes, during which time I added 1.5 roughly chopped onions and 3 cloves of garlic. I then caramelized half a can of tomato paste before deglazing with low sodium College Inn chicken broth. I filled the pot with water and added two roughly chopped carrots; two bay leaves (broken in halves), a tablespoon of peppercorns, and a large handful of fresh dill.After bringing it to a boil, I let the stock reduce for about three hours. Towards the end I started making the soup: first I cooked some pasta and made the meatballs. While the standard pasta for this soup are elbows, I used a great variation on elbows, Barilla's pipette rigate.Ingredients for MeatballsI rolled the meatballs into 3/4″-round balls and cooked them for 3 minutes in unseasoned, boiling water (the same water I used to cooked the pipettes).Before assembling the soup, I pulled the shanks out of the stock pot and pulled the meat off them. Then, I strained the stock and saved the carrots as a snack for Jessica later. In the mean time, I finely diced half an onion into a two-quart sauce pan, and added the stock. I also added a teaspoon of red pepper flakes, two cloves of garlic diced, lots of dried oregano, and adjusted seasoning (a little salt was necessary). In the mean time I rinsed some baby spinach and gave it a very coarse chop.Just before serving the soup, I added the spinach and some more parsley to the soup, along with the meatballs and pulled lamb meat (to reheat). I served with the pasta in the bowl.The overall flavor was phenomenal. The stock had a rich flavor and the soup had just a bit of heat from the cayenne in the meat and the red pepper flakes in the soup. The spinach was also cooked perfectly.While this soup does take a bit of work, it is worth every second. A lot of love goes into making soup like; and it can't be rushed. Perhaps that's the reason it has magical curative powers?See more pictures of the soup and the cooking process in our Flickr set.

just curious - why not cook the pasta in the soup?
Lon
2007-08-20 20:21:00
I never cook pasta in the soup broth for several reasons.  First, I'm not sure how cooking pasta in non-water affects timing, as opposed to in water, where it's easily controlled. Second, I want to cook the pasta in rapidly boiling water, if I boil the soup I'll loose too much liquid and need to add water.  Third, cooking the pasta in the soup will release starches into the soup which will thicken it.  This is ok for some soups (like hearty chicken noodle or a stew) but not for Italian Wedding.Jessica also adds that it's the wrong kind of starch: to thicken you would be better off with potatoes.Also, it's hard to gauge the right amount of pasta for the amount of soup. It's better to make extra and portion it when serving in the selected bowl.  Keeping the pasta and soup separate also makes for better refrigeration.

D'Artagnan Organic Chicken- Baked
CONTENT
Last night I ate one of the best pieces of chicken of my life, if not the best.When I came home from work, Jessica was standing over a freshly butchered chicken from D'Artagnan (as in ducks, not Dumas). We had never tried one of their items before, and we were eager to see if the organic aspect (no antibiotics, no growth hormones, no arsenicals and no artificial light) made a difference in the taste. I joked about deep frying the bird, but Jessica had a better idea.Using the Crispy Baked Chicken recipe from Karen Wingate on AllRecipes as inspiration, Jessica coated the chicken in one beaten egg (rather than milk) and baked the chicken, also excluding the melted butter from the recipe. It's a good thing too, this was one of the juiciest chickens either of us have eaten. To give credit where it's due, Jessica did a perfect job cooking it, and the recipe was a great recipe; but this bird played a big role.The meat had a wonderful texture and for once, the saying, \"it tastes like chicken\" meant something. The natural fat from the skin crisped the cornmeal perfectly; and, both the white and dark meat portions tasted rich.Even if you can't get your hands on the D'Artagnan chicken, I recommend you try the recipe. However, the chicken is worth every penny and can be ordered online, either direct from D'Artagnan or you can order on Amazon. We, for sure, will be trying a few more of their products in upcoming posts.

The service is there to please and the oddly mixed crowd (60% black, 25% white, 10% Asian, 5% other) is well dressed. Lon and I had eaten dinner already but were sad we did. The menu, with a Grilled Cheese Theme in several gourmet variations, sounded so good, now we'll have to go back!

I wanted soup on Fri since it was pretty cold and rainy. I decided to try the Soup Man Soup Man, 1 block from my office, and as soon as I noticed the prices, I wished it wasn't raining so I could motivate myself to walk further for lunch. I resorted to a cup size vegetarian soup, the cheapest thing they have. It came out to $5.36 for 8 oz of soup, bread, and a choice of banana or a tiny apple. The Lentil Soup was good but not good enough for those prices. I tasted the Tomato Wild Rice and it was way too sweet. The meat and seafood flavors go into the $7-10 range for a 16 oz, the size I normally get from anywhere else. I just had 16 oz of Seafood Gumbo from Food Exchange (on Broadway, can't find a link or address for them) for under $5 a few days before. I will never go to Soup Man again! Total rip-off!

The 2 foodies met at Borough Food & Drink Borough Food & Drinkfor what seemed like a cool concept. They collect all the best stuff from the different boroughs and create a menu around it. They source from places like Russ & Daughters, Sullivan Street Bakery, and more. I had high hopes but my Jerk Chicken was dry, sitting on top of even drier rice and beans, with a spicy but flavorless scotch bonnet sauce. We shared the Tobacco Onion Rings which were good but excessivley salty. I didn't finish my dish or the onion rings which is not a good sign and to top it off, it was an expensive lunch. At around $21 per person, I can think of plenty of other places I'd rather be.***Update May 1, 2009  - Bourough Food & Drink is closed***

Yoshi Japanese Restaurant and Mary's Vermont Dairy

I saw some good reviews on Yoshi Japanese Restaurant Yoshi Japanese Restaurantso I was excited to go. Lon, Andy, and I were all disappointed. The quality was a bit below average and the cuts were terribly ugly. The salmon pieces had a whole layer of fat left on and the yellowtail was an awful cut that made it unrecognizable. The salad that comes with each dinner is also really sad. The wilted greens and watered down dressing set the stage for the coming meal.While we were walking home, we spotted a Mary's DairyMary's Dairy. Lon bought a chocolate and cheesecake fudge that looked much better than it tasted. I asked the employee if the ice cream had food coloring in it and he said he didn't know. To play it safe, I only tried the cookies and cream and the Yin-Yang (milk chocolate with dark chocolate pieces), flavors I could reasonably assume were not colored. The cookies and cream was super sweet with cream over-powering the cookie part. Andy and I both got the Yin-Yang, surprisingly less sweet than you'd expect of milk chocolate ice cream. While I appreciated that it was less sweet, none of the product we tried impressed me enough to ever go back.Better luck next time.....

Sunburnt Cow is Over-Cooked
CONTENT
For Edgar's birthday, Friday night, we joined him, Qiang, and eight other friends for dinner at Australian-styled The Sunburnt Cow The Sunburnt Cow. Two friends were there early, at about 6:30, having come straight from work; we got there at 7:45, and everyone was there in time for the 8pm reservation- a rare occurence in NYC. We were promptly seated just past the bar. The front of the restaurant is a standard bar, with two projectors displaying random movies askew -- that night \"Kill Bill: Vol. 2\" was playing. That's where the good part of the night ended.Ordering at Sunburnt is similar to that of something like a cheap theme restaurant. You sit down to a paper menu with a pencil handy. You check off what you want to eat and hand in the menu. While the kitsch is what it is, we were unimpressed, particularly when it turns out that one item was unavailable and they ran out of a second item- both which we learned AFTER turning in our orders. This point highlighted another flaw in their ordering system, they requested people write their names on the menus; however, they were unable to read some of the handwriting. Anyway, I saw the waitresses transcribing orders onto standard notepads, so the intermediary step seems a waste.Jessica and I were the only people to order an appetizer- the Fried Calamari with Kiwi-Jalapeño Salsa. Our food showed up 45 minutes later! Some people were not complaining, probably due to the amount of alcohol being consumed, but I did enough complaining to cover them. When the calamari did show up, it was hot, but tasteless. The seafood was cooked until rubber, the kiwi was mushy, and there was no taste of the pepper.The food for the table started arriving 20 minutes later (well over an hour past when we ordered). Happily all the food was served piping hot, along side a second glass of their complimentary house drink, a Mango-Juice & Tequila Shot (which was tasty). My order of beef ribs had a distinctive tomato and fennel-seed taste, almost like Italian sausage, which I enjoyed. My side order of corn and crab ragout was wonderful, a great overall flavor, albeit, incredibly buttery. When you order a main, you can pick one of their sauces. I had the spicy mango chutney, which sat, left-over, on the side of my plate, save for two tastes from me and Jessica.Jessica had the grill fish, a 1/2-inch thick fillet of barramundi. It was slightly over-cooked, but quite good, and again, hot. Her side-order of Mushrooms & Shallots was not as good- it was pooled in liquid and tasteless.Overall, the food was mediocre and the service was atrocious -- we think our waitress was slightly mentally handicapped. And after two hours sitting on an uncomfortable bench and chair (I actually grabbed a pillow off a nearby seat to help), we were itching to leave, plus Jessica was going to run Saturday morning.I'd recommend you run, right past Sunburn and try some other place.

Deborah, that's a great question! Particularly, at places like Monster Sushi or Wave (downtown), which are known for huge rolls, often 2-3 inches in diameter.  Even I, with my big mouth, can't eat them in a single bite.I suppose they're more for presentation then combination of flavors.

Herr's Whole Grain Pretzel Sticks
CONTENT
I snack on pretzels pretty often but I'm not generally loyal to any brand. There are slight differences in quality but not much, so I'll usually just buy whichever one is on sale. That's how I came across Herr's Whole Grain Pretzel Sticks. I was a bit reluctant since I'm not a fan of Herr's potato chips but I'm glad I gave them a shot. These \"multigrain pretzels with flax and honey\" are actually unique in the world of pretzels. For some reason, I taste pumpernickel but the ingredients include everything but.....tons of different grains and poppy, sesame, and caraway seeds. Lon and I also noted that they use a good salt on the outside. If you're not worried about your sodium intake, try this healthy snack.*Update (11/18/07) - We just got another bag of the Herr's Whole Grain Pretzel Sticks. While they are still delicious and probably my favorite in pretzels, I don't taste the strong pumpernickel this time.

They prepare it in 2 ways, the traditional Old Bay or garlic and oil. Both ways taste great and the crab is cooked perfectly!! It comes with not so good corn and decent french fries, and a roll of paper towels, shell crackers, and bibs. There's also a whole menu of other items like soup, salads, and other seafood dishes. The service is good and the waitresses are always eager to bring you more crabs.It took me almost 3 hours to eat 12 crabs and a plate of french fries (that's refillable too) and I'm dying to do it again.

After attending the last night of Midsummer Night Swing, we headed over for dinner.The table of 5 shared 2 appetizers. The prosciutto with melon was delicious. Fresh melon, expertly sliced meat, and a surprise dab of marscapone. What a nice touch! The salad of poached pears, sugared pecans, and fried goat cheese was fantastic. The blackberry dressing was unique and wonderful. Sadly, this item is a special and not available on their regular menu.Most of us ordered pizzas, which are super thin with quality ingredients. Lon had their signature lasagna. It looks like a lasagna pastry with 3 meatballs on top. It's yummy! My only regret is not coordinating to order a wider variety of foods. They have an amazing display of antipastos in front. I stared on my way out wishing I could have some.I went to Cafe Fiorello years ago with my family and it was a great dinner for all of us then too. The prices are right. I need to go back more often.

Happy Birthday to... me.  At Del Posto!
CONTENT
For my birthday, Jessica treated me to a wonderful dinner at Del Posto Del Posto. For those of you who aren't in the know, Del Posto is Lidia and (her son) Joe Bastianich's and Mario Batali's largest (at least fiscally-speaking) venture. About two weeks ago, Jessica grabbed reservations on OpenTable and let them know it was my birthday, and asked if they could do anything special. And they did.In my oh so (not) humble opinion, they gave us the best table for two in the house. It was located in the upper level, to the right where there are only three tables and ours is in middle over-looking the entire restaurant. It's substantially quieter up there and you feel like you're in a private space. We were seated by the greeter/maitre'd and then visited by our waiter, who spoke with an accent and oddly forgot words like \"herb\" which I assume he uses regularly. But it's forgiveable because he was a great waiter with a wonderful personality. Same with the two busers who served us bread, water, and cleared -- great personalities and heavy accents.While perusing the menu a complimentary course was served, like an amuse bouche, although it was called something else (neither Jessica or I caught the word used). It was comprised of a pea soup beautifully served in a clever, shot-sized glass; a slice of cured ham on a small plate; a fried zucchini flower with basil pesto on a second small plate; and, a slice of zucchini and slice of squash over fresh yogurt on a toast point, on a separate plate. And in that order they ascending from horrible (neither of us could finish the pea soup) to wonderful (we loved the flower and even more so, the toast point).We opted for the $85 per person Del Posto Menu, which allowed for each of us to choose an antipasti, primi, secondi, and dolci. It was noted as a five-course meal, since each of our primi's would be served in halves and then shared, in other words, half of my primi went to Jessica and vice versa. It was a great way to enjoy the food, and I highly recommend it.Jessica started with lobster and polenta, it tasted phenomenal and included a substantial portion of lobster. We loved the polenta, but both agreed it was more of a corn pudding then polenta. I started with the \"Artichokes DUE\" which offered a well fried (almost bronzed) artichoke heart, that was presented beautifully as a flower and then acidic sauce of cut hearts and perilla. Both were delicious, the latter being the best of the two.We then moved on to the primi Jessica selected: Spaghetti with Crab, Chive Blossoms & Havanero Oil- that was my favorite dish of the night. The crab was completley superfluous in the dish, succumbing to the incredibly taste of the not-too-spicy oil. It also included a sprinkling of bread crumb, which we didn't like. We independently thought they were crab shells, and decided the texture variation didn't overcome the odd-factor.Then we shared my selection: Crisped Potato Gnocchi with Braised Pork Shoulder, Celery & Nepitella. The gnocchi were just seared on one side and otherwise quite soft and flavorless. The pork was cooked perfectly but also didn't have much flavor. Fortunately the celery and the nepitella brought A LOT to the party. In fact, the nepitella, also known as Nepeta or CATNIP, was the really winner. Both of us loved the flavor and so we must be part feline. Meow.By the end of the pasta dishes we were already feeling full. But we persisted on to Jessica's entree, the Cacciucco with Burnt Fregola and Red Mullet; and my entree, the Slow Baked Wild Salmon. The cacciucco was served over some type of barley and included pine nuts. Jessica enjoyed it, while I was underwhelmed at best, particularly due to the over cooked seafood. After I got home, Bill told me that he's heard Batali say on TV that traditionally Italians cook seafood longer than Americans. I haven't heard that myself and can't find anything about it online, but I don't care for it.My fish was not over-cooked, but had no flavor, less than typical salmon even. The best part of the dish was actually the avocado. In fact, not just because of the avocado, the dish was California Cuisine-style, odd for a generally, Italian-inspired menu. I recommend skipping this dish.Finally, for the dessert course, Jessica had the Soufflé di Cioccolato: Chocolate Souffle, Hot Chocolate, and Brandied Cherries with Espresso Gelato, which she enjoyed; but we both thought was a wintery dessert. I had the Sorbetti, four flavors of sorbet, I think they were mango, lemon, passion fruit, and raspberry.They also brought over a cart of nine or ten types of petits fours. We were very full by this point, but tasted all of the sugary treats. The hazelnut white chocolate petit four was my favorite, but I found them all too sweet.In the end, we think this is the amongst the best service in the city -- a real 10 out of 10. The food was quite good too, at least an 8 out of 10. Particularly, we enjoyed the unique dishes that we've not seen at any other restaurant. I highly recommend you give Del Posto a try.

Based on your very explicit well written review - no way does this deserve 10 out of 10.  My take on your review was 7.5  Obvious miscommunication!

Korean Fried Chicken

Over the years, I've lost interest in reading the generic food articles written up in most newspapers and magazines. The same subjects get re-used over and over again, while restaurant reviews are not honest (pumping up whoever is paying top advertising dollars), and the recipes are either old or untested.My friend Andy sent me this article about Korean Fried Chicken and it really caught my interest and it was a quick and easy read. Surprise, Surprise. Next time, I'm in Queens, I'll be trying some of their recommendations.Hey, if anyone has tried any of those places, let me know what you think!

Peking Duck Forest
CONTENT
Peking Duck Forest Peking Duck Forest is surprisingly authentic. Located by the Austin Street shopping area in Forest Hills, you'd think it was one of those typical Chinese restaurants with the Lo Mein, General Tso's, and Chicken with Broccoli. While those dishes are also offered, you can also get the real stuff if you know what to order.The Peking Duck there is superb, from the flavor and texture of the duck skin to the house made wraps, to the friendly chef who carves your duck table side. Don't worry if you're a first timer, the chef also expertly makes each wrap for you with the right proportion of scallion, cucumber, duck and sauce. Just enjoy watching and then eating.I also recommend dishes like Dungeoness Crab, Imperial Stuffed Lettuce Leaves, and Shrimp Stuffed Tofu. The prices are good, the staff is friendly, and you can get real Chinese food without going to a whole in the wall joint in Chinatown.

Oscar's at Waldorf Astoria
CONTENT
My boss took me to lunch at Oscar's Oscar's for a break from the heat (our office had no air conditioning as a result of the steam pipe explosion on 43rd Street). They do a good job maintaining a cool temperature without being freezing like most air conditioned restaurants.Each table is given a basket of fresh breads, a raisin fennel, a cheese topped, and regular French. We split a crab cake appetizer which was good because it was mostly crab but had a weird choice of condiments. A spicy barbecue was smeared across the plate. A blob of a ketchup mayo mix sat on the side. A small clump of guacamole was on top. The guacamole worked for me and the other 2 sauces didn't.I ordered the Zuppa di Pesce and Roger had the Grilled Rare Yellow Fin Tuna Panini. The shellfish in my dish were cooked perfectly (especially the shrimp) but the sea bass was a bit over-cooked. The tomato-herb broth was very flavorful and great for dipping. The overall impression was a good one especially since it was a nice portion size.The nice plating, nice decor, very good service, and pretty good food makes the lunch prices worth it.

Bryggen Kaviar
CONTENT
The incredibly poor quality image to the right is that of a tube of special caviar made cod fish. Normally, cod (and it's subsequent family members haddock, whiting, and pollock) are considered mild flavored (a.k.a. tasteless) fish. How so then is their roe so damn delicious!?It turns out that by curing the roe and adding just the right ingredients, and injecting the product into a blue cylinder, you can actually create a tube of heaven, and it would be called Bryggen Kaviar. The product is sold by Domstein Enghav, who in their parent company's business concept page says \"Domstein shall be... the preferred supplier of marine value added products in selected markets.\" Well if the market is bacon toothpaste, then my god, they have succeeded!The products ingredients are 1/2 sugar salted and smoked roe (52%) from codfish caught in the North East Atlantic Ocean, rapeseed oil, sugar, water, salt, potato flakes, tomato puree, preservative, anti-oxidant, citric acid, and colour. The result is absolutely delicious! Kelly, Jessica's mom, brought back this product from a recent trip to Norway. Both of Kelly and I think this stuff is incredible, plain on a cracker, or as a base ingredient. Jessica and Justin were not as excited by it.This reminds me (oddly, since it's totally unrelated), to Taramosalata, a Turkish dish made from cod roe. I've had Tarama a few times, prepared to varying degrees of success. If you're in NYC, you could try it at Taksim (in the East Village Taksim E. Village or Midtown Taksim Midtown).

Caviar in a tube, you can't compare that one to the real deal though. I can't see how that would work anyway, putting it in a tube. Wouldn't it ruin the structure ? Apparently it's a big thing to put this on sandwiches in Scandinavia, but this isn't the natural form. IMO cod roe doesn't deserve the name caviar, especially if it's in a tube. But if I come across it I will give it a try, who knows, maybe it is delicious.Kind regardsFoodTVblog

Opia

I went to a networking Lunch at Opia yesterday. When work pays for food, I shouldn't complain but my duty is to tell the world where to eat.It was a pre-fixed package that started with a Ceaser salad. I didn't eat it so I won't comment. Then we had a choice between 3 main courses. There was a plain penne in red sauce (nothing else in it), a chicken dish with french fries that looked like a diner dish, and the salmon dish I chose. It was pan-fried and plated nicely with a saffron sauce, rice, and some greens. It looked pretty nice but tasted just ok, the main problem being that the salmon was very overcooked. The dessert was a nice cup of (I think) coconut ice cream. strawberry ice cream, and raspberry/lemon sorbet with a tuille.It wasn't terrible but I wouldn't go back.

That's my \"we want oxygen\" / bring it to the streets rant, what do you think? It's about the CO2-packaged meat that's been around for a bit; and it's time it goes away. I was really happy to read an article over at Slate about this issue. Particularly, because they have a copy of a letter from Safeway SVP, Meat & Seafood, Michael McGinnis, stating that Safeway will no longer carry meat in CO2 packages.To read more about this issue, start with one of the (many) links from the article, the best link is to Food Safety Magazine. There's also more on Wikipedia and various links on Google.

The Best White Balsamic
CONTENT
Thanks to Anon's comment, we were informed that O & Co. O & Co. (in GCT) carries a new White Balsamic with Oregano. For some reason, the producer felt the need to add caramel coloring, but it works. It is the best white balsamic I have ever tasted!If you don't know how to make salad dressing, I suggest buying one of O & Co.'s vinegars and just sprinkling the vinegar and a good olive oil over your salad. You won't need anything else.

Let's Not Rendez Vous at This Cafe
CONTENT
From the outside looking in, Le Rendez-Vous Cafe Le Rendez-Vous Cafelooks like a pizza joint with a bar on the side. When you get to the back, it turns into a Middle Eastern theme. The menu includes a mix of Italian (wierd) and Middle Eastern foods and Hookah.The 5 of us decided to split 3 appetizers. The hummus tasted like tahini with very little chickpea. The Babaganoush did not look or taste like Babaganoush and that's because it had large chunks of onions and peppers in it. The tabouli didn't actually have any bulgur (a primary ingredient) in it. The pita was dry, crappy pita.As main courses, we all got platters of either chicken, beef, shawarma, or lamb kebabs. They all come on top of rice that tastes like Uncle Ben's and a large salad with Italian dressing from a bottle. The salad is fresh though. As for the meat, I can only speak for my chicken and Lon's Shawarma. My chicken was so over-cooked, burnt, dry, and almost inedible. Lon's shawarma didn't taste like anything. Lon also added a plate of falafels which were super fried into very crunchy jet black balls.Aside from the food already being pretty terrible, Janny's plate didn't arrive till we were half way done eating. This is the kind of place that makes me nervous about trying new places.

I ran the Naples - New York Park to Park race this morning in Central Park as part of Team in Training. Lon and Ice came to cheer me on in my second race ever. This was my first experience ever in grabbing water while running and while I did manage to hydrate, I also snorted water up my nose, and spilled it all over myself.After the race, we headed south to find an area for Ice to play ball. After Ice was completely worn out, we headed out of the park in search for lunch with outdoor seating and found Cilantro.Cilantro A basket of fried tortillas with cinnamon and 2 mini blueberry muffins(delicious) is placed on the table for customers to much while browsing the menu. Lon chose steak and eggs which comes with flour tortillas and home fries (Lon asked to substitute it with the spicy fries). The steak and tortillas were good, the eggs were excellent, the fries were horrible. I chose the shrimp fajitas which came with a great green sauce. The peppers and onions were oily but the overall flavors worked and we were generally happy with our meal. It's a good place for an inexpensive low maintenance meal.

New Yeah Shanghai Deluxe
CONTENT
Last night we hunted for our dinner. Unfortunately, the hunt didn't take place with spears in hand, through the forest; but rather with Vindigo (a foodie must-have) in hand, through the murky streets of Chinatown. Along for the hunt were our new friends Kate & Jesse. Jessica and I remember a wonderful place where we had eaten with her family and longed to return. We couldn't remember the name or the address, but knew they had great soup dumplings, a crappy-looking entrance way, and a bridge inside (which is not visible from the street). None of these are remotely helpful data.After not too long our \"Toucan Sam\" noses led the way and we found it, New Yeah Shanghai Deluxe New Yeah Shanghai Deluxe. We waited for five minutes and then were seated in the front section. We ordered quickly: Soup Dumplings, Sautée­­d Japanese Eggplant, Salt & Pepper Pork Chops, Steamed Whole Fish, and Sautée­­d Crab with Rice Cakes & Edamamé.The eggplant arrived first, it was perfectly cooked with a brown sauce that was tangy from ginger and delicious. Shortly afterwards the pork arrived and then the Soup Dumplings. The pork chops were cooked correctly, grilled and then fried, topped with salt, pepper, and shredded scallions and chili peppers. They were nothing special, but delicious nonetheless. The soup dumplings were the star of the show. The four of us gobbled them up and smiled the whole way.Finally the whole fish came and was good- we weren't sure but they looked like two whole Perch, dressed in a gingery, brown sauce with mushrooms. I threw my mushrooms onto Jess' plate and dived in. The fish was good, but also nothing amazing. The only real disappointment at our meal was the crab. Upon initial delivery, the crab dish was served sans rice cakes (a.k.a. nian gao)! Now we love our rice cakes, so we sent it back and a few minutes later it re-appeared. There was not much rice, and it was all stuck together, and the crab was not meaty and very difficult to eat. We've had that dish at New Yeah before, when it was delicious, so this might just be off season, or bad luck.If you're looking for the best soup dumplings, head over to Bayard Street and visit New Yeah. You'll thank us for it!***Update***Read it!

For the longest time I've wanted to take a trip to the famed Taste of Chicago -- a massive, two-week, outdoor eating fest that takes place annually in the windy city's Grant Park Grant Park: Taste of Chicago. Yesterday, at least 120 people, and reports of up to 400, were sickened by one booth's herb, tomato, and cucumber hummus salad! I guess my friends who hate healthy food were right after allIn no way would this stop me from going. Even though at least 10 people have been hospitalized, this is the first food-borne illness in over 20 years at the Taste of Chicago event.

My Favorite Fruit Stand
CONTENT
Of course I love loading up on produce in Chinatown or Flushing, but since I can't always make the trip, I frequently buy fruit from a fruit stand Best Fruit Stand on University Place, in front of L'Annam. It's twice the size of most fruit stands in Manhattan and offers better prices than most too. It's run by a mom with 2 or 3 sons; they generally sell fruit, but sometimes have vegetables as well. Most of their stock is ready to eat that day, so occasionally you have to be aware of their goods being over ripe, but usually I'm very happy with my purchases there. Oh, and they're usually wiped clean by 5pm so try to stop by early.

Lon has been telling me about Zeytuna Market Zeytuna Market for a while so we decided to go there for lunch. They have a nice outdoor seating area where half is for table service and half is seating for anyone purchasing food inside. They also have seating downstairs where they have a buffet of prepared foods, kebabs, sushi, pastas, etc. I couldn't tell you if it tastes good because it's a madhouse during lunch so I squeezed my way out and opted for the deli upstairs. Lon had a sandwich with hickory smoked ham, salami, mayo, lettuce and tomato, and black pepper on a Portuguese roll. I ordered the grilled chicken with lettuce, tomato, and mustard on a multi-grain hero. All of the ingredients were super fresh (meat sliced to order) which is no surprise when you watch the traffic coming through. I was impressed with the moist grilled chicken and the delicious mustard they used taking the sandwich just a step above the rest of the delis I've been going to for lunch.The price is comparable to any other deli in the area but Zeytuna Market's sandwiches have a gourmet flair and you can enjoy outdoor seating. The only problem is that it's not close enough to my office to go more frequently for lunch.They also have a nice market with a wide variety of vinegars and oils, so we conveniently did some shopping too. We picked up a tomato vinegar by Mutti, something neither of us had ever tried. Unfortunately, neither of us liked it. Lon also got a bottle of Pinzimolio Olive Oil, which he likes, but I didn't find special.

Great Fage Page Advertising
CONTENT
While thumbing through this week's issue of New York Magazine earlier today, I noticed a brilliant advertisement by Fage Yogurt, one of Jessica's picks. It's shown below...In case it's hard to tell from this low resolution image, on the right page is a whole page of yogurt, with an imprint of the Tourneau watch from the left page! The ad first caught my attention because I opened the right page without having looked at the left page, so I spent 30 seconds trying to figure out what the imprint was supposed to be. Then after opening the book fully the design made sense.This is another great campaign by Ogilvy. They also have this ad with Honora Pearls on the left page (also discussed on AdCritic).

Treatise on Grilling
CONTENT
It seems almost needless to say, but having a blog and being verbose I shall: grilled food is delicious food! We've talked about grilling before, as recent as the post about Clean BBQ, and in the past for events such as Mother's Day. Today's entry is about why I think grilling is so delicious.BackgroundIn the U.S., grilling is a method of cooking that involves any type of grill, and direct heat from beneath the grill. While many consider indirect cooking on a grill a type of grilling, I do not. With indirect heat, if there is smoke, it is barbecuing; if there is no smoke, it is roasting. For me, an ideal grill has a cooking grid that consists of half inch-wide bars, made from a metal that retains heat well- such as cast iron. There is a lot of debate in the outdoor cooking world about what type of fuel is best: natural gas, propane gas, charcoal, wood, etc. While the fuel has a tendency to impart flavor, when I'm grilling, I do not want flavor from the fuel- so I prefer natural gas, it is the closest to flavorless; and I despise propane, which to me, has the worst flavor (sorry Hank Hill). Before you start getting too concerned, note that again, grilling is not barbecuing. In that case, the fuel should add flavor, and then being picky is important. When grilling, I just want a super hot heat source- 500 degrees F or better.FlavorWhen people discuss the flavor source for grilling, a few concepts get thrown around. The most common I hear is caramelization, which is when the natural sugars oxidize in the presence of heat to produce invert sugars (yum). People in the know frequently refer to the Maillard reaction, which is when amino acids (building blocks of protein) and sugar react in the presence of alkaline conditions and heat, creating a new compound (i.e., new flavor) and water; the type of compound created is based on the initial amino acid. These first two are the most technical and are based on what the raw foods offer.Other IngredientsAlternative explanations relate to ingredients external to the primary food to be grilled. The most popular are rubs and marinades. Rubs (a mix of dry, ground ingredients) can add a lot of flavor; and if there is salt involved, water may be drawn out of the primary food and the final product may have a more concentrated flavor; plus, the water moved to the surface may aid the Maillard reaction. However, marinades are usually the opposite of rubs. Marinades also add a lot of flavor, but are usually acidic. Acidity adds benefit in that the primary food's tissues may break down, making the final product easier to chew and digest. However, as mentioned above, the Maillard reaction requires alkaline conditions, which are base (in pH), and acids counteract that, potentially reducing the effect. So when marinating, you may not achieve the full benefit of grilling.Another external ingredient could be the grill itself! While I've heard stories of grills at restaurants that haven't been cleaned in 50 years, generally, I think of basic, seasoned grills. A good grill just needs a little love and a little cleaning but otherwise it can begin to lend its own great flavor to your foods.The Real FlavorWhile there are many aspects of grilling that lend flavor, I think the heavenly flavor comes from one distinct aspect of grilling. That is the distribution of gradated results of the Maillard reaction. Let me explain:Whenever you brown food through direct heat the Maillard reaction will begin at the part of the food that touches the cooking surface and the food will cook fastest at those touch points and radiate outwards into the rest of the food.Most browning is actually searing, such as in sautéing, but even in grilling. The radiating cooking and Maillard reaction is best exemplified in seared tuna, a fairly common dish these days. You can easily see the browning around the edges, and the grade of color change from the outside in towards the raw tuna. It is the variation of flavors that come from different levels of Maillard reaction and caramelization that make the food taste so distinctive and wonderful!And in grilling, there is even more dramatic variation of flavors because there are many cooking surfaces touching the food. I think that is why cross-hatched grill marks (as shown in the salmon picture at the beginning of this post) is so wonderful. In addition to really showing the grill cook's skill, it increases the flavor impact of the grill. Further, searing causes the food to lose moisture, I've heard numbers as high as 25%, so in grilling, the moisture loss is likely reduced. Perhaps, I will test that theory one day.If you'd like to learn more about grilling, we recommend \"BBQ USA\", by Steven Raichlen.Last Note: CancerResearch by the American Institute for Cancer Research indicates that grilling food produces heterocyclic amines (HCAs), cancer-causing compounds in the meat and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the smoke caused by drippings. Earlier I slightly disparaged marinades for grilling. Let's revisit that point for a moment. AICR's research shows that marinating meat for at least 40 minutes prior to grilling can substantially reduce HCA production. To avoid PAH production, avoid drips hitting the heat source, there are tips on AICR's page.To help fight cancer, please consider donating to The Leukemia and Lymphoma Society.

Nutrition for Marathoners
CONTENT
I've been running with Team in Training, a group that trains for athletic events while raising money for The Leukemia and Lymphoma Society. It has been an amazing experience so far and I've been overloaded with information about nutrition for marathon runners. I think I can handle eating the bigger breakfasts, carb heavy meals, and the timing of meals, but now that the runs are getting longer, we have to power up during runs and I'm afraid of all those bloks, jelly beans, and gu. I'm going to have to try them within the next 2 weeks but I'm taste and consistency sensitive (cause I'm a foodie!) and I'm deathly afraid of putting this stuff in my mouth. I've never been a fan of power bars and the way these power foods have been described to me don't sound so good.If any of my readers would like to donate on my fundraising page, I'd feel really loved! Thanks!

Flashback: My First Angel Food Cake
CONTENT
Almost exactly six years ago I made my first Angel Food. I had watched an early episode of \"Good Eats\" and felt like Alton really provided good ideas for how to ensure a successful cake. And as usual, I never leave good enough alone, so I came up with a few further ideas for how to make it good.And so, below is a reprise of a post from my site six years ago, about how to make a great angel food cake...4. Alton's advice: buy a pan with a post taller than the pan edge. Now, that's some good thinking (of course, I overfilled)! Check out my clever work. 5. Still cooling (I backed away slowly, to not knock that thing over). 6. That was surprisingly easily to get out of the pan. 7. Look at the beautiful carmelization. 8. Cutting the cake in half was not easy. I soaked the cake in Galliano and then spread a whipped Strawberry jam over the bottom. 9. Check out that luscious strawberry! 10. Putting the cake back together, was just as difficult as taking it apart. 11. But it was obviously worth the effort. 12. I made my own frosting! Check out that great frosting work. 13. Now that's some good frosting. 14. Now that is a beautiful cake!Good luck, and enjoy the great (not so unhealthy) cake!

My Most Favorite Name Change
CONTENT
We stopped in at Connolly's to wish our close friend Steve a farewell from his current job at HBO, he's moving over to R/GA -- congratulations Steve! On our way out we noticed that the previous location of My Most Favorite Dessert, famous for their cookbook, was now bright orange and called My Most Favorite Food My Most Favorite Food.We stopped in to investigate and found out that the restaurant remains the same -- although attractively renovated. The food is the same and the owners are the same. We were told that the name change was to help make clear that they don't only serve dessert. Having eaten there numerous times, I can attest that they do have full courses.They also re-affirmed that they maintained their OK Kosher Certification. Because I haven't eaten there in a while, I won't review their food, but I will note that it's a good location to keep in mind if you need a dairy kosher restaurant in midtown.

Product Review: Clean BBQ
CONTENT
There are many advances lately in the world of cooking gear- many of which seem to be focused on cooking inside. But what about cooking outside? Today we review a product for just that: \"Clean BBQ\" a disposable grill liner. Actually, Jessica and I do our grilling inside- on a Blue Star Indoor Charbroiler (in the Residential Nova series range).To test out Clean BBQ, we cooked a few products, and will discuss the two that seem most prescient: hot dogs, a classic barbecue food, and fish, every barbecue's nightmare. Before we could get to the cooking though, we had to figure out how to use the liner. As you can see from the picture above, to the right, the structure is a largely corrugated aluminum with regular cutouts. For some reason, I first thought I'd need to wrap the liner around some of the grill rods, or perhaps try to line up the corrugation with the grill. Neither of those are necessary. After placing the liner over the grill, it sits perfectly, no fuss. Plus it was simple to cut to length using normal scissors. I also tried tearing it bare-handed to see if that would work in a pinch, and while it was a bit messy, it did work.Hot Dogs & BunsIt seemed to us that hot dogs were the simplest and most common barbecue food. All you need for a BBQ is a few wieners and buns, you're good to go. So we placed our liner and fired up the grill. After a few minutes the hot dogs went on and were cooked according to package instructions. Just before fully cooked, we toasted the hot dog buns on the liner. Everything cooked as normal and there was no sticking.You can see that the liner did receive the cooking residue from the \"after\" picture to the right. However, after removing the liner, the actual grill was still dirty and needed to be fully cleaned. So while the liner did not hurt our cooking process, it did not help our cleaning process. If we were cooking on a public grill, I likely would have cleaned the grill beforehand anyway, so the liner didn't save us much work.FishFish is a classic grill item that doesn't seem to be as popular any more, unless you're a camper. That's probably because it can be a nightmare for the grill cook- it sticks easily and can be difficult to work with. So it seemed like a perfect challenge for the liner.We seasoned our fish with some general Cajun spices (this was eaten in our dinner with Pete) and then placed on the liner over a heated grill. Normally, we would use spray or some oil to lubricate the grill. Clean BBQ doesn't assert that their product is non-stick, just that it \"resists sticking\". Well, our findings, as you can see, is that it doesn't, in any way, resist sticking. All of the skin was ripped off the fish by the liner. I have grilled red snapper on this grill before, without spray, and it is normally not this dramatic. Also, the fish did take somewhat longer to cook than normal with the liner.SummaryThe primary function of Clean BBQ is for protecting food from the dirty grill. And the product seems to achieve that well. Although the gaps are pretty large, and it's hard to tell if the food touches the grill underneath. Clean BBQ however fails to meet its secondary function of eliminating the need to clean the grill. In all cases where we used the product, the grill was dirty afterwards. The last problem I have is that I like perfect grill marks and the product changes the way the grill marks look.If you're going to a public grill, Clean BBQ would be a handy product to have around. For all other uses, just buy a really good grill brush.

Dinner with my Male Bridesmaid

Lon and I made dinner for Peter, my Bridesmale/Bridesman (don't know what the correct term is), last night. Everything came together wonderfully.We started with a salad of romaine, radicchio, endive, cherry tomatoes, and cucumber. The dressing was made with balsamic and fresh lemon. Our bread was a whole wheat panelle.The main course was a 2.75 lb whole red snapper from whole foods. We grilled it whole with Cajun seasoning and topped it with a mango salsa. We served a side of a brown rice blend we had gotten from Justin K. (who gave us everything in his kitchen when he decided to take the kitchen out).Pete brought over a bottle of Ferrari-Carano Fumé Blanc. It was delicious and tied everything together.For more pictures, check out the Flickr photoset.

It's All in for Breakfast
CONTENT
Lately, I'd been having a hard time deciding what to eat for breakfast. Sometimes I'd have a deli breakfast sandwich (like egg and cheese) or just a banana, but I wasn't satisfied. Then we starting buying loads of fresh fruit.We now keep boxes of blueberries, strawberries, and raspberries around. Sometimes we also have bananas and cherries too (although I don't use cherries in this recipe). So for breakfast, I just slice up a few strawberries, and toss in some of the other items along with some other ingredients for a great breakfast.Jessica has been doing this too- however, she typically adds some yogurt.Some ideas for ingredients you could include:I usually rinse the strawberries and blueberries before adding, in addition to removing debris, it also gives the flax seeds something to stick to, if you don't add yogurt. If you can't find mulberries, which I think are a great addition and can be found at Organic Avenue, you could use raisins.

Smartest Way to Chill Beer
CONTENT
There are a lot of people out there who like beer, after all, it's the world's oldest and most popular alcoholic beverage. Jessica can particularly attest to that fact after her visit to Brooklyn Brewery. I would wager that most beer drinkers do not like their beer watered down; so what can you do on a piping hot day like yesterday to keep your beer chilled, but not water it down with ice? There are many crazy ways, but here's something simple and effective.Angie, our brilliant host, demonstrated a clever technique to keep your beer literally on ice, while drinking it. Simply put an inch or two of crushed ice in a one cup then another cup over that to hold your beer. The result is illustrated to the right.Next time you're drinking your frosty ale, think of Angie- and her trick (I couldn't find anyone else online talking about this method).

It's been brought to my attention that my line about "frosty ale" is a sensitive issue in the beer drinking world. I should've said "frosty lager" to avoid any contention. Ales vs. Lagers is the main categorization of beer, and there is a lot of detail in determining the proper drinking temperature for either.

Beef, Korma-Style
CONTENT
When looking upon the top sirloin that we had defrosted for dinner, I just didn't feel like having it as a steak. For some reason it called to me as beef korma. While there are several recipes on AllRecipes for Korma, I decided to make my own.Korma is a mild-curry dish that is prepared typically with yogurt and nuts. However, I don't care for nuts in savory food (usually) and we only had either flavored (vanilla) or expensive (Fage) yogurt around, I had to improvise.Ingredients (approx.)InstructionsAfter cutting the steak in half, it was about 8oz; I seasoned it with kosher salt and then grilled it to barely rare.While the steak was cooking, I heated a tablespoon extra virgin olive oil and a table spoon of unsalted butter in a saute pan over medium-low heat. I then added half of a large, yellow onion, roughly diced and seasoned with a pinch of kosher salt and a teaspoon of red pepper flakes (jalapeño slices would be good too). As the onions softened, I slowly added the key flavors of Korma, about one teaspoon each of: cayenne pepper, turmeric, cumin, garam masala, ground ginger, and a bay leaf; you could also add some coriander if you have it on hand, I didn't. Then I tossed in five garlic cloves, sliced. You need to keep the heat low and the ingredients moving in the pan to avoid burning.After the steak rested for a minute or two, and the sauce had been going for about eight minutes, I diced the steak into about one inch by half inch by half inch pieces. They were absolutely under-cooked inside, that's what you want. I tossed these into the sauce along with about 1/4 cup of half and half and 1/4 cup of frozen peas, coating everything evenly.Immediately after adding the peas, which will drop the temperature slightly, taste the sauce for seasoning. I decided mine needed more salt and black pepper. I cooked it for another minute, to bring the meat to medium (although medium rare would be nice too) and then plated along with seasoned rice: I used cilantro, ginger, and garlic in my rice.The dish is mild and delicious. The red pepper flakes really added some pop to this normally simple dish, and it is was simple and fast to make. Enjoy!

Lunch

I little while back I talked about the woes in finding a good lunch by my office. It hasn't gotten much better but it's a step up. I've been eating at Variety Cafe. Variety Cafe It's one of those big places where you pay by weight. It's decent stuff for $6.49 per pound: shrimp, fresh mozzarella, portobellos...Keep in mind that the cold bar is way better than the hot bar. The cashiers are speedy so at least the line moves quickly.

Tarallucci e Vino
CONTENT
I've walked by Tarallucci e Vino Tarallucci e Vino a couple of times and always intended on trying it. I had forgotten about it and then my friend Sarah suggested it for lunch. We got a table outside, where we could enjoy the New York summer and catch up on the latest about each other.We had such a hard time deciding what to order since so many menu items were appealing to us. We're both also notorious for being worst at deciding what to eat. Sarah tried a panini - Filet of Tuna, Artichoke Hearts, Mayo. The ciabatta was good but the tuna was canned tuna and we felt misled. It was good for what it was, but when you call something a filet of tuna, we're expecting a filet. I decided to try the Tagliatelle al Grano Saraceno con Cime di Rapa e Funghi (Buckwheat Noodles with Broccoli Rabe and Shiitake Mushrooms) since I don't often see buckwheat noodles in an Italian restaurant. It was good, but not amazing.I almost feel a little disappointed, but it's not because the food was bad. For some reason, I just feel like the other menu items might have been better. I feel like we ordered wrong. We saw an amazing looking Salad of Fennel, Oranges, Beets, and Fresh Mint. The Cheese Plate also looked yummy. The quality of the ingredients stood out as well as the fresh taste and attention to clean feel. It's not an expensive place, so I may give it another shot.

Sometimes You Just Want Simple
CONTENT
Over at ThisIsBy.us, I read a story called \"I Just Want a %@*$ing Burger! by bbstucco. It was humorously written, but the moral of the story is something I've discussed with friends many times. Sometimes you just want plain food. This is no surprise to Anthony Bourdain or many other professional cooks, who after a night of preparing steak au poivre just want a grilled cheese (and yuck, usually a cigarette).Cooks need to keep genre in mind when preparing food. This was particularly clear on a recent episode of \"Top Chef\" where the contestants had to prepare down home food and some totally missed the mark (such as Miss Meatloaf).The other day I talked about the importance of knowing your ingredients, now I'm saying, also know your cuisine.

Veggie Salmonella- It Gets Worse
CONTENT
Robert's Gourmet expanded the recall that we talked about to include their Super Veggie Tings Crunchy Corn Sticks product. I guess unsurprisingly, this correlates all the way back to the Chinese- and our post about Chinese food safety. And so while, I've basically accepted that the Chinese could care less about food safety, it was disconcerting to hear Robert Ehrlich, president and CEO of Robert's American Gourmet, say that he had been unaware of where the ingredients used in the seasoning originated. Oy!

Lili's Noodle Shop & Grill
CONTENT
About five years ago (I guess) Steve and I noticed a new noodle shop on 3rd Avenue at 84th Street, it was a convenient and enjoyable spot to grab a bite to eat. It was and still is Lili's Noodle Shop and Grill Lili's 3rd Ave -- we went back again tonight and it was as good as ever.The weather in NYC is still pretty sour- overcast, raining, seventies, so I went for some soup. I had the Wonton and Roast Pork with Udon noodles. While I'm not happy that the bowl was $9.45, I was extremely impressed with how perfectly executed it was. The roast pork was cooked perfectly and had the right flavor of five-spice balanced by a bit of sweetness, it was moist and tender. For $1.50 (the original price was $7.95) I added the udon- it was perfectly cooked, and it was the slightly-flattened shape, which I prefer because it seems to be easier to eat. The soup was piping hot, while Jessica prefers the narrower shaped bowls, I prefer the wide mouth like this, so it cools enough that I can eat it.Steve enjoyed his Vegetable Mai Fun and Bubble Tea, I didn't try either so I can't comment directly on them. What I can comment on was the great service, a common problem in Chinese restaurants. We were seated promptly, served the water as requested (no ice), and when I asked for the traditional soup spoon, rather than the metal type, it was delivered without fail (as shown in the picture above).Here's another example of the service quality. Steve and I split a Large Roast Pork Bun (which again, was pricey at $1.95). When ordering, the waiter informed me that it would take a while for the bun to arrive, and he recommended we don't wait; I agreed. When it did arrive, it was hot outside, but still frozen in the center (I had cut it in half). I notified our waiter, he rushed it away and arrived a bit later with a whole new one (i.e. not cut in half) and apologized profusely. Those little touches make all the difference.We enjoyed our meal and Steve had plenty to take home (I didn't finish my soup either, but didn't take it home). If you haven't been to Lili's I recommend giving them a try; there's a second location on North End Lili's North End as well.

Batali Hates il Bloggeros!
CONTENT
Heavyweight celebrity chef Mario Batali has gone on record (twice, actually) stating that he hates food bloggers. On the Eater.com page, the comments swing back and forth discussing about whether he hates bloggers or not, he is still a talented chef. In a recent BlogSoop post the point is made that most bloggers heavily favor the talented Italiano. Overall Batali's comments are hypocritical, generic, and baseless, as I will discuss further below; but it's ok, because he is acting exactly as I described in my review of celebrity chefs: \"pompous, condescending, and extremely pedantic.\"Batali on his ThroneThere is so much wrong with what Batali says, that it seems to me the easiest way is to bullet point quotes from him and then quickly indicate the problems (I'll stick to the bigger issues):So at the end of the day, I'm not sure what the man is whining on about. Bloggers are treating him well, the future seems to include a big place for bloggers, and his entire argument is not thought out well. Stick to food Mario, keep the media discussion to your public relations team.

I have heard stories of an anonymous troublemaker who wrote a hard-hitting opinion piece that ranted his snarky vituperatives from behind the smoky curtain of his anonymity . This allowed him a peculiar and nasty vocabulary that seemed to be taken as truth by virtue of the fact that it has been printed somewhere. He wasn't a journalist and he didn't have a publisher review his work, but he had a medium and just let his opinions flow and wouldn't even sign his name to the darn thing. I would even state that his work strangely superseded truly responsible journalism.But, in the end, I do not hate Thomas Paine or his pamphlet "Common Sense."

Sarge's Delicatessen
CONTENT
After watching Transformers, we were starving and ready for lunch. We walked up Third Avenue and decided to try Sarge's Delicatessen Sarge's Delicatessen since some people had heard of it. There was a short wait for our party of 6, which was weird since we passed by a couple of empty tables as we walked all the way to the back.Like every Jewish-style delicatessan, Sarge's offers pickles and coleslaw. The pickles were the worst I've ever tasted! They tasted like very salty cucumbers. There was no detectable acidity. The coleslaw was exceedingly sweet and I was starting to get nervous about my lunch; the waitress was really crabby too.Lon and I ordered soups: the matzo ball was pretty good and the mushroom barley was awful. There was a weird, off flavor (I hope I don't get sick) and it was super salty. Luckily, things turned around with the sandwiches. Everyone seemed happy with their pastrami, corned beef, and hot open brisket, or roast beefs with gravy. The people who tried the pierogis and stuffed derma gave thumbs up, and the fries were good too.Even though the meal ended better than it started, none of else felt like we'd go back. It wasn't memorable and the decor stinks.

This is the worst place I have eaten in a long time.  The food was horrible - either burned or cold - and it looked like they hadn't changed their frying oil in weeks since every fried item was almost black.  The service was not only SNAIL SLOW but also obnoxious and sloppy.  DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY in this place.

Silo Cafe
CONTENT
Recently I commented on how Susie's is the worst deli, and so my hunt continued for a half decent deli in Murray Hill. After trying quite a few, I stumbled upon a new cafe, that opened next to Artisanal called Silo Cafe Silo Cafe. Silo is more than just half-decent, it's wonderful.In addition to being modern and clean inside, Silo features various deli and cafe foods, but seems to do them all well. They have a hot sandwich and grill area, pizza, cold salad bar, hot buffet, custom salad, custom pasta, deli sandwich area, pre-made and custom sushi, and more. There is a large seating available and the entire space just feels open and inviting.For my first visit, I selected their hot sandwich special of the day, a Philly Cheese Steak. The seemingly simple sandwich is actually more difficult to prepare correctly than it seems. The grill cook took his time and used thin sliced steak and plenty of mixed bell peppers and onions. He conscientiously asked me what type of cheese I wanted- and I went with provolone. He steamed the bread over the melting cheese and steak. Overall the sandwich was greasy and delicious; my only complaint is that some peppers were not sliced to the correct size and the meat was cooked medium and I prefer rare, but I didn't ask specifically.Yesterday, I paid a second visit to Silo. This time I patronized the custom pasta bar, selecting bolognese sauce over farfalle with black olives and grilled eggplant. The cook sauteed (in too much oil) the olives and eggplant; reheated the pasta; tossed them together with some sauce and it was ready in about three minutes. The bolognese offered little value, but the pasta was cooked correctly and the olives were delicious. The eggplant tasted like grill or propane, and so I didn't care for it. The portion was huge and only $6.95. Plus for $1.00 I picked up a soft piece of parmesan bread.The food at Silo is good for a deli/cafe, it's not amazing. The experience inside is perfect: fast service, good prices, and great atmosphere. I will visit again and suggest you do the same.

Tsuki Sadly Disappoints
CONTENT
A few years ago, Tsuki Tsuki was one of my favorite Sushi places. I raved about it to everyone. It was a special place where my friend Chrissy and I would meet to catch up every time we hadn't seen each other in a while.Of course I told Lon about it and I hyped it up so much that he was extremely excited about finally going last night. Unfortunately, it bombed. The famous volcano roll, which used to be a sushi artistic masterpiece, no longer looks like a volcano and is half the former size. The once super fresh and flavorful sashimi is just average. The oshitoshi, a spinach appetizer, was also average.I didn't recognize the sushi chef last night so I was wondering if the previous owners sold the place (didn't find any publicity online). It used to be two sushi chefs behind the counter that worked together so harmoniously while striking up conversations with the guests at the sushi counter. This guy never spoke. The service is still very courteous in the style that the Japanese do best but the food is no longer worth going so far East.

Jessica's description is completely accurate. I want to highlight the idea that regardless of whether it was sold or not, I absolutely hate when restaurants go down hill. Since the decrease always seems to be cost-related, the result makes them look cheap and only focused on profit. And while, this is America and I am a capitalist, I wish more restaurants (and any business for that matter) stayed focused on the product quality.

Why Cooking is Hot!
CONTENT
Often, when Jessica and I eat with friends, they're amazed about how we will wax loquacious just about the food we're eating or other food we've cooked. Yesterday Marc commented about how excited we were to talk about cooking while eating at Wild Ginger; and he's not the only person to have mentioned it. So it seems suitable to talk a little about why we love cooking. Maybe some other cooks who read this will chime in?The PassionFirst and foremost is that cooks have a passion for food. We feel it. Raw ingredients are the medium by which we express our artistry. While some post pictures online to show off their photography skill, we post pictures to the FoodMayhem images section and to our Flickr page to show off our cooking skill. We truly enjoy setting up plates that end up looking like the one to the right (baked potato balls served with a red pepper hummus).Of course, after creating the plate, we love to eat it! When perfect, the work should overwhelm your senses. I guess this is why we choose food over clay or paint for expressing ourselves. We enjoy the look, the aroma, the mouth feel, and of course the taste. And speaking for myself, I enjoy hearing food cook.Another aspect of the passion is expression. Cooks look at ingredients and envision dishes. The same raw ingredients, or even cooked-off ingredients, can result in many different plates. Case in point, about a year ago, Jessica and I marinated two pork tenderloins in a citron and tea dressing. We also made a roasted corn and black been salsa with mango and cilantro; and a cilantro and lime enhanced rice. The first night we slicked the pork and plated it over rice, accompanied by rice and snap peas(shown to the right). The next night, we diced the pork, and served it with the same rice and salsa in a roasted tortilla shell, burrito style, accompanied by salad and more salsa. More pictures in the Flickr set.Objectively SpeakingThere are many side benefits of cooking other than the passion. And while some people cook only for these reasons, we see them as ancillary benefits.Controlling what goes into your body... It is almost inevitable, whether you dine at vegan restaurants or fast food, that you are eating unhealthier food than had you cooked it yourself. Restaurants cook fast and need to ensure flavor: that means high heat, plenty of fat, and often salt. Plus their dishes need to be visually stunning for all audiences, which also often means artificial colors and unnecessary ingredients. I was thinking about the ingredients when I read the article this morning on AlterNet called \"There's a Lot You Don't Know About What's in Your Food\".Jess is allergic to food coloring, I hate mushrooms, other people are allergic to nuts, shellfish, strawberries, and who knows what else. While we may be getting closer to a cure for allergies, we're not there yet. So cooking for yourself means absolutely avoiding the items you don't want to be near. Even when you think you know what ingredients are in your dish at a restaurants, you may not; plus, they may have touched allergenic items on their way into your dish.Most people seem to despise healthy eating, or even the sound of it. They assume healthy food tastes worse than unhealthy food. As I mentioned above, just the act of cooking your own food will increase the health factor (relative to eating out). However, if you purposefully cook healthy you will see phenomenal results. For instance, you could ensure proper portion sizes- 4oz of protein, 4oz, of carb, and a one-third plate of salad is filling and a full meal. If you're used to eating huge restaurant portions, it may take you a week to get used to a normal portion, but give it two weeks and you will be pleased.For instance, a while back, Jessica and I enjoyed a great dinner of chicken (with just salt and pepper), strawberry salad (with jicama and poppy seeds), and a cranberry and carrot rice pilaf. The food was rich, flavorful, and healthy. It included a carb, a protein, fruits, and vegetables. In those last categories alone there was spinach, strawberries, jicama, carrots, cranberries, and pearl onions! See more in the flickr set.FrequencyGuests often ask us if we cook this way every night, and the answer is- yes, basically, and mornings too. The more frequently you cook, the easier it is. You will be able to maintain a fully stocked pantry, be eager to keep fresh ingredients around (as you will actually get through most without spoilage), and have plenty of leftovers for when you're too tired to cook.And, finally, practice makes perfect. Both Jess and I really honed our skills in our early-20s (more in our bios). It's not too late to start. Try some easy recipes from AllRecipes.com or from FoodMayhem, or from any of the links from the lists in the bottom right of this page. And just keep practicing until you know your ingredients and kitchen tools.And, of course, if you need help, send us comments and we will gladly advise! Best of luck.

Wild Ginger, Great Neck
CONTENT
Yesterday, Jessica and I joined Marc and Karla for lunch at Wild Ginger, Great Neck Wild Ginger-GN -- I want to be specific since there are dozens of restaurants with the same name around the country, and they are unrelated (except for a second location at Bronxville Wild Ginger-Bronxville. It was beautiful weather so we sat out front.We each got an appetizer, and Marc grabbed a ginger ale, served in a nice tall ale glass. He also started with the Chicken Satay, which came with a mango peanut dipping sauce. Karla got the Thai Spring Rolls, Jessica got the Japanese Seaweed Salad, and I got the Dim Sum. I really enjoyed the dim sum, they were a ground pork stuffing in the open top style shell and a single shrimp in the middle. Overall, Jess' seaweed was the winner- it was served crisp and fresh with jicama and a sweet dressing. Initially it didn't seem too sweet, although, by the end we were sugared out.For mains, Marc got the Chicken Pad Thai, Karla had the Yaki Udon, Jess had the Grilled Sesame Salmon, and I had the Sambal Samba. Marc's food apparently didn't sit right, as it kicked the crap out of his stomach (literally). Karla enjoyed hers more than Jess did: the sesame salmon turned out to be over-cooked, over-sweet salmon teriyaki.Except for the fact that my sambal was loaded with fungus (I won't eat mushrooms), which I sadly had to pick out while groaning, the flavor was phenomenal. Like Jess' my seafood was way over-cooked, but the eggplant was delicious and the \"Indonesian spices\" were the exact right level.With decent service and really nice chopsticks, I would likely go back, next time I'm in Great Neck, NY.

Veggie Booty is a product that so many people enjoy due to it's gourmet-like qualities. The product is considered vegan, it's baked, it's kosher, it's gluten-free, it's GMO-free, no nuts, no rennet, and they use non-hydrogenated oil! These are some kind of super-snack, apparently made from nothing but love and air. Oh, and salmonella. Yep, this weekend a national recall of Veggie Booty has been announced due to salmonella cases in 17 states.Robert's American Gourmet, manufacturer of the bacterialized booty, has posted information on their web site about the recall. They have also announced a temporary discontinuation of booty production. What will all the hip hop artists sing about now?

NYC Trans Fat Ban and Calorie Counting in Place!
CONTENT
As of yesterday, New York City is now on the look-out for Trans Fat. It could be anywhere: in your french fries, in your salad, even lurking in your closet waiting to jump out and scare you when you least expect it! Actually, I made up that last part.More interesting to me will be the impact of the second legislation that takes effect, that requirement for fast-food restaurants to post their calories. It seems like each chain is taking various approaches. Starbucks is putting their information in a spiral flip book. Does anyone expect this to have an impact? Doubtful. The regulation calls for posting the calories in equal size next to the price.Starbucks is not the only violator: Burger King, McDonald's, and Wendy's are all giving the middle finger to the rule; but since their latest stay in court means they won't get fined until at least October.

Brunch at Sarabeth's
CONTENT
I had brunch at Sarabeth's Sarabeth's (East) with a great group of TNT-ers today after our Saturday morning run. I had dinner at the UWS location Sarabeth's (West) a couple of years ago and was quite disappointed. The brunch was much better which make sense since that is what Sarabeth's is known for.As soon as you're seated, coffee comes around and is constantly refilled (same with water). I love places that do that without you looking for a waiter every time you finish your cup. The menu had so many unique items (like Pumpkin Waffle with Sour Cream, Raisins, and Sunflower Seeds and Honey) that I had a really hard time deciding. I also got a glimpse of several plates as we walked in and everything is plated wonderfully. I was really disappointed when I found out that I couldn't order several items since they had food coloring. The Almond Crusted French Toast with Cranberry Cherry sauce sounded so good!!I finally decided on the Whole Wheat Pancakes with Bananas and Wheat Berries which was very good but not \"wow\". The thing is that the prices are in a range where I don't require \"wow\". I actually think that you get more than what you pay for and I'd definitely go back because maybe some of the items are a \"wow\".

POLL: Real NYC Hot Dogs
CONTENT
As many of you know, and are likely eagerly awaiting, the Annual Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest is rapidly approaching (on July 4th). The event, held at the original Nathan's Nathan's Original, which is both covered globally by press, and entered by contestants from all around the world, is a spectacle to behold; especially as told by George Shea, the IFOCE spokesperson, who emcees the event. And it begs the question, what exactly makes a real New York Hot Dog? That question was specifically raised recently, read on below...

I just voted for the dirty water dog.  I'd have to say that that is what is commonly considered a "real" New York hot dog - but I have never, and will never eat one.  I've eaten at Gray's (and at my father's various iterations of the 50cent hot dog joints) and think a grilled hot dog is ALWAYS best.  At home I'll even grill a hot dog in a pan before boiling it.

Steve, Great movie reference- I love the "Great Outdoors!".  Interesting that you grill before boiling.  For home cooking, I'm also a fan of the combo- technique, but I boil before grilling.  P.s. stay tuned for an upcoming post on a cool grilling product, in which I actually grill some hot dogs.

I <3 nyc dirty water dawgs, but I have to say I'm now a convert.Out here in the mission (san fran's mexican neighborhood), we have border dogs (aka, bacon wrapped hot dogs.)They are grilled on little carts that look like converted ice cream push carts.  No dirty water, but you get: * The grill top flavor of a Gray's * The convenience of a street cart * and you get the god blessed flavor combination of bacon and pork!

Real New York Hotdogs can only be obtained at Yankee stadium, home of New York's only professional baseball team.Best with a tall beer, lots of mustard, kraut, and a double header.

After speaking with my dad, he says that grilled hot dogs are the "original" - which to some may mean "real".  Born in the Bronx in 1933, he says that he didn't see pushcarts with boiled hot dogs until he was in high school.He said that NYC Jews got their hot dog from Kosher delis, where they were always grilled, unless you ordered a "frank & beans" in which case you would be asked if you wanted your hot dog grilled or boiled.At ball parks, the hot dogs were often steamed, with the rolls - since the rolls were often stale.My dad's challenge to Lon: find the issue of Life Magazine where on the cover the King & Queen of England, and Elenore & FDR were pictured eating hot dogs at the White House...
Lon
2007-06-30 12:40:00
Oh, I love a good research challenge! Well, I think I've got the answer to this one.  Perhaps your dad was thinking of the cover of The New York Times on Monday, June 12, 1939.  That covered the news of the previous day when King George and Queen Elizabeth of England were served hot dogs by Franklin Delano & Eleanor Roosevelt at the president's Hyde Park home.After some research, I'm pretty sure this was never on the cover of Time.  In fact the next two issues of Time featured the graduating class at Annapolis and then Payton Jordan.  In that second issue, from June 19, 1939, the royal tour was discussed, but I don't see any reference to a hot dog image.

While I am partial to both the NYC dirty water dog and the Yankee Stadium Dog of champions, I feel it necessary to nominate another.  The Lucky dog of New Orleans is a high quality processed product.  Get one with raw onions when leaving the bar after several hours of liver abuse.... there is nothing like it.  Be prepared to taste it for a day after.... mmm mmm good!

Chickpea Chickpea is more expensive than your average falafel & shawarma joint. Some of their products are worth it and some aren't. Here's what you should and shouldn't get:Order:Falafels - Different people prefer different sized falafel balls. These are the smaller ones and very fried but well flavored and seasoned.Pitas -They make their own. Super fresh!Sauces - The tahina sauce and hot sauce are both good.Chickplant Sandwich - I had this a while ago and I remember liking it.Don't bother with:Shawarma - Shredded into very small pieces and covered in way too much cinnamon.Rice/Kasha - On the menu, some items are served over rice but it's actually kasha and it's not great kasha.Average:Chicken Kebab - I'd rather get this somewhere cheaper but not too bad.Hummus - Nothing special

Dead Sodas

Matt at x-entertainment compiled a brief list of notable, dead sodas. Reading the list certainly provided a quick flashback. How many have you had? I think I tasted most of these, except the tropical Pepsi flavors.More recently, Matt posted about the summer line up of notable flavors, including Pepsi Summer Mix (which I hadn't heard of) and Diet Coke Plus, which one co-worker frequently drinks.It seems that these new flavors, are likely to make one of Matt's future lists of dead sodas.

Hellmann's 'Real Food' Series

In in a moment of genius, the boys over at Ogilvy & Mather have come up with a show that is all about mayonnaise! It's Hellmann's 'Real Food' Series and I want to eat every last bite of it! Or perhaps you didn't read my bio?Sadly, the show is not really going to be all about mayo, as good as that sounds. Instead it will feature ultimate bore Dave Lieberman (who didn't even make it to my review of Celebrity Chefs) will wander around the ole U.S. of A. and talk to people about what they consider \"real food\". So basically, it's a chef I don't care about, talking to people I don't care about. And it's on Yahoo Food!So, unlike I ever do with Hellman's real product, I think I'll take a pass on this show.

Primehouse, Coming Fall 2007
CONTENT
Recently Jessica and I have become more respectful of B.R. Guest Restaurants. Particularly since our Barça 18 review. We've realized there is a specific niche in the NYC restaurant price spectrum for B.R. Guest, they seem to acknowledge that spot and fill it perfectly! The formula includes, decently good service, decently good food, generally attractive and usually modern decor, a well stocked bar, and prices in the $40-50 per person range. They're slightly more pricey than average and slightly better than average. And most important, they are consistent.Well, it seems they'll be launching a new venue to try out the formula. It's called Primehouse Primehouse. I noted the location walking to work this morning. It's just down the block from another B.R. location: Dos Caminos, one of their restaurants that did not work for me.I'm interested to see how this works out for B.R.; there are so many steakhouses in NYC, and many are great, such as Dylan Prime. But one of the best, BLT Prime, is not very far from Primehouse's new location. We'll have to keep an eye on this bullfight, err, bison fight.

Godiva's Chocoiste Line
CONTENT
Last night we sampled a new product line from Godiva: Chocoiste. The theme of the line is focusing on packaging yum yum for the tum tum of an individual (that's industry parlance for 'delectable'). For instance, an individual chocolate chip cookie, with rich chocolate laced over the top (half of which was available at the time I snapped the photo, at right, burp). That cookie was outstanding; Jess thought it was average. The cookie, and other bakery goods, such as the chocolate-dipped marshmallow, may only be available at Godiva stores.Another item in the line are domes: almost chip-shaped sandwiches of flavor and chocolate. I tried the raspberry. While we all agreed the white chocolate was great, the raspberry was almost undetectable.Other items in the line include a set of pearls: little balls of chocolate, with various flavors. I tried the mint; they were enjoyable, much more subtle (and enjoyable) than the chocolate Altoids I had the other day. The pearls seem to be available in many flavors, and I dig on the box, which was designed for easy opening and closing.In the end, we were all chocolated-up and thoroughly enjoyed our Godiva treat. I recommend you go ahead and try it yourself!

CORRECTION! Since posting, I've learned that the chocolate chip cookies and marshmallows aren't actually in the Chocoiste line - they are freshly dipped chocolate items that are made daily and only available in Godiva boutiques.  The dipped line includes brownies, strawberry/banana kebobs, macaroons, etc.  Chocoiste includes Pearls, Domes, Bars, Fruits/Nuts (Chocolate covered raspberries, strawberries, and almonds) and are available in Godiva boutiques as well as other channels such as Barnes & Noble.

FreshDirect TeleSpam!!

Ugh! FreshDirect is getting desperate. Yesterday evening, we received a voicemail from FreshDirect's Sarah James, as you can hear in the message, she's part of their SPAM team!! It makes me sick that companies feel it's ok to randomly telemarket people at home. Do you think there are executives out there thinking, \"Gee, I love receiving telemarketing calls at home on MY personal time, I should have my company do that too!\"?We've been talking about FreshDirect's issues since 2003 (and 2006 and 2007), looks like they're not getting better, but worse. The voicemail message is available for your listening pleasure to the right. She's clearly well practiced -- sike!

I have ordered from FreshDirect 3 times so far and I must say I was only satisfied once. The other two times, either some item was missing or the blueberries came rotten and moldy. I went on a quest looking for other online services and cam across breadnbrie.com. They are like FreshDirect, only smaller and so far, my first order is great. And the service is really good too. The delivery person was actually Ilya Z, the founder himself! We spoke for a while. He seemed eager to ensure that all was well. I was pretty impressed. I am ready to  order again this Friday.

LU's PiMs
CONTENT
Today we spent time at my sister's place, enjoying their brand new baby girl, Sabrina- she's gorgeous! Less enjoyable though were the PiMs cookies we tried while there.They are a cracker-like cookie, topped with a half marshmallow/half-mousse-like concoction, and finally coated in chocolate. Sounds good, right? Wrong.Both Jessica and I did not enjoy them at all. The cookie was too dry, the chocolate was over-whelming, and the filling had less than average flavor.PiMs are made by LU Biscuits, and so I have to wonder if they've always tasted this way, perhaps even since LU was founded in 1846? Or maybe across the various changes, from when Lefèvre-Utile Biscuit Co. changed names to LU, or was acquired by Generale Biscuit S.A., and then acquired again by Groupe Danone, the biscuits lost flavor?

Lon

KG,Le Petit Ecolier are not as bad (particularly the dark chocolate and the hazelnut varieties) as the PiMs, but I don't go crazy for those either. The Creme Roulees, Le Fondants, and Chocolatiers are the best of the bunch though.  However, those are pretty common and usually taste the same from every brand.

2007-07-01 12:49:00
I liked them...I don't think they were supposed to taste at all like a mallomar.  The mousse under the chocolate served as a nice contrast to the harder cookie.
Sebastian Doyle Ferguson
2008-11-19 01:15:00
Firstly, there is no marshmallow, nor is it supposed to taste like marshmallow.  It's simply a soft biscuit with a filling and a chocolate layer coating the top.  One would think that a food-based blog would have more knowledge of ingredients in food products.We suggest that you try other PiM's flavors such as the orange or raspberry.
Jessica@Foodmayhem
2008-11-19 08:35:00
Sebastian, if you read carefully, Lon wrote "half marshmallow/half-mousse-like" and while we food bloggers love to learn as much as we can about food, we don't know everything. Processed food can be mysterious, hence my move away from eating any of it.BTW readers, on their website, it looks like the flavor we tried is no longer being sold.

How many guys does it take to mess up pancakes?
CONTENT
The answer is 3.We had lunch at 3 Guys, 3 Guys a diner with 3 locations, on the Upper East side. Lon ordered pancakes with scrambled eggs with cheese. The semi-warm pancakes were overcooked and far from fluffy. The cheese on the scrambled eggs had a really weird taste and we didn't continue eating it.I opted for a make-your-own omelet with tomato, spinach, and muenster cheese. It came out severely overcooked yet it wasn't even hot and the cheese inside had barely started to melt. I don't even know how they accomplished that. The potatoes were gross and none of it was seasoned at all.To top off the misery, this meal wasn't cheap. When I find these 3 guys, I'm asking for my money back and extra for pain and suffering.

Susie's Kitchen: Worst Deli in Manhattan
CONTENT
As some of you may have noticed by now, I've been spending a lot of time in Murray Hill, at a client lately. The largest deli in the area is Susie's Kitchen Susie's Kitchen. It's the same as many other delis in the city, just larger. They have a salad station, burrito station, sandwich/deli counter, hot/cold buffet, wide drink selection, pre-made sushi, and various soups and miscellaneous other standard fare. If they're so typical, why am I calling them out?Susie's Kitchen is the worst deli in Manhattan! The clerks who work there are nice, so that's not an issue; although the sandwich clerks have never assembled a sandwich correctly (for me or others I witness). But the main problem is their food -- it's consistently horrible. Figuring out how they manage to produce such horrible tasting items is beyond me. It might be the ingredients?For example, their roast beef, is served semi-frozen, along with the thickly-sliced tomato they put on it. Their chicken has zero flavor. I tried a burrito and it tasted like a bag of over cooked rice. On the buffet last week they had a huge pile of fried whole fish (they looked like sardines). What deli puts that out? I was not surprised that at 2:30pm the entire pile was still there.And, finally, the oddest part. A few times I've eaten various egg-based breakfasts (sandwiches, burrito, platters) from Susie's. They are all horrible. I recommend an experiment. If you have $7 dollars and time to spare: order a sausage, egg, and cheese on a toasted English muffin from Susie's. Then walk down the block to the Cafe & Deli, with a brown awning. I believe it's called AristotleTaza Cafe & Deli Taza. Compare the two. See what a fantastic breakfast and a horrible breakfast are like side-by-side.

I Got My Sandwich!
CONTENT
On my way home tonight, I had to get my sandwich, particularly after regaling people with the story from earlier today. I stopped in at the Union Square Subway Restaurant Subway and I got more than I bargained for. The clerks were so nice and were excited to make, yet another, crazy huge sandwich. As they made it, everyone watched and laughed.First of all, I learned there is only one size bread, and it's about 7-8 inches long, and tall. My dinner was at around 8:30pm, so the bread I got seemed a bit old, and not the best sample. So I'll just say the bread was a bit dry, but you probably shouldn't rely on that. I got \"The Feast\" which contained pepperoni, salami, roast beef, turkey breast, and ham; actually, I'm not doing it justice. It contained A LOT of pepperoni, salami, roast beef, turkey breast, and ham. I should've weighed it when I got home, but alas, I did not. It had to be a pound and a half of cold cuts. He added Swiss and American cheese (only a few slices) and then toasted it. Afterwards, I selected lettuce, tomatoes, black olives, green peppers, chipotle mayo, and black pepper.The massive sandwich rang up at $9.47. I lugged it home.After snapping a picture or two, I started working on the thing. It was huge, I could barely take a bite. But I struggled through, bite after bite, enjoying it thoroughly. Honestly, the proportion of pepperoni to other meats was way out of whack, and I will probably have heart burn later, but it was fun. The last bite felt like crossing a finish line.This kind of sandwich is almost more of a joke than a real world useful meal. How often I need a 15 pound lunch is beyond me. But we'll see how long it's around. As an aside, this is one of the first sandwiches that looks as attractive in real life as it did in the ad (at least before I carried it home). Not all fast food is that way.

Nice review.  The movie SuperSize Me must have had quite an impact on you.  I'm sorely tempted and I love pepperoni, but that nearly $10 cost doesn't seem quite palatable.  This from a guy who orders and eats a couple of Burger King Angus Burgers for lunch.  I'm definitely a beefeater sort of a guy.What the heck.  You sold me.  I'll just skip a couple of meals to whet my appetite, then I'll blow a tenspot for a potential heart attack.  Haha.Constable

Trebuchet03, a member over at Instructables has done it! Seriously, this is better than nano-tech, Apple iPhone, and cold fusion power put together! It's a guide to making Bacon Placemats!! Let me calm down for a second, before I continue.Ok, I'm back and it's time to mention how impressed I am that Trebuchet decided to \"get the cooking process going\" with butter (step 2). Nothing makes bacon taste better than butter. Or, at least, so says Homer. And that he ensures BSI, bacon structural integrity in step 3.Another piece of great advice, which I personally think is applicable to everyday life is \"be conscious of your bacon\".

That's pretty cool. Good idea for having a sandwich with A LOT of bacon in it!

Actually, I have an update.  Friday night we had a small get together, and I attempted my own bacon bowls!  It did not go well :\  I successfully assembled three mats, however, because of the bacon length and quantity, I had to cut the strips in half to make them square.  This left them at about 6×6 inches, which was more like bacon coasters.After baking them for 15 minutes, I pressed them into small, metal prep bowls.  The edges ended up curling up dramatically, and the amount of fat seemed to braise the bacon rather than fry it.In the end, we pulled them apart and used the strips, which tasted fine.  I may try these again though, as usual, I think the solution is: MORE BACON!

Subway Mayhem
CONTENT
Remember the other day, when I thought I had discovered THE mayhem? I was wrong, that was nothin'!! Recently Subway started running an ad campaign for a super-stuffed sandwich. And the few Subway restaurants around my home hung signs in their windows with pictures of the monster. It's shown on a twisted bread, which looks similar to their party sub bread. I believe they say in the commercial it has triple the meat of a normal Subway sandwich.I have to assume that Subway launched this product, even though it absolutely goes against their years of advertising and branding as a healthier alternative, because of Quizno's recent \"WrongWay\" campaign that talks about how little meat there is in a Subway sandwich. It seems there are many people who hate the campaign, and I'm not surprised, it was created by a tiny ad firm and is basically the $80 million dollar equivalent of five year old's name calling. And who is Quizno's to name call anyway, Subway could just as easily call them \"Ratty's\".Anyway, on to the point. Today, I wanted to try that great big Super Stuffed Subway Sandwich. I headed to a nearby Subway at Park & 30th Subway. Before walking in I noticed they didn't have the sandwich image in the window, and after asking the clerk, they weren't carrying the sandwich yet. He pointed us to the Subway at Madison and 33rd Subway. Sal and I walked over to the second subway, which had the picture in the window, and after walking in, noticed they had signs all over the store and the menu board for the super stuffed.And so began the Abbott and Costello routine... I asked Clerk #1 if the super stuffed comes in 6″ and 12″ and how much it costs (and I pointed to the sign). He asks Clerk #2, and then says \"$9″ (note the lack of answer about sizes). I ignored the extreme price, because I'm doing this for you, the readers! Then I pointed at the picture that had two versions: \"Meat & Cheese\" and \"The Feast,\" and said \"Ok, I'll take 'The Feast'\". Clerk #1 replies \"Which sandwich?\" I repeat myself, \"The Feast\" (pointing slightly more vigorously). He looked confused. I looked at Sal, who offered no help. I tried explaining to Clerk #1 that \"The Feast\" is, in fact, the sandwich and that it is listed on the board. He brings in Clerk #2. I managed to snap a picture of the two guys, shown below, to the right.Before continuing, I should note that all of this took place with a crazed, Russian accent (well at least on their side of the counter). After another quick round of the \"What sandwich?\" game with Clerk #2, Clerk #2 asks, \"Which bread do you want it on?\" I am now confused. The marketing campaign clearly touts their new, twisted, huge bread. Nevertheless, I ask \"What are my options?\" He points to the normal bread options and says \"Any of these.\" Confused, I ask \"The twisted bread comes in these flavors?\" Clerk #2 says \"No, these are the only kinds we have.\" I say \"The Super Stuffed is supposed to come on twisted bread,\" and again, I point vigorously at the huge picture one foot behind him, which apparently he's never looked at.After a few more mind games with crazy clerks at Subway, I walked out, sandwichless, dazed and confused. Had Sal not been there, I would've assumed I dreamt/nightmared the insane volley of wits with the Subway clerks. Particularly, because I searched for the \"Super Stuffed Subway Sandwich\" online and the search engines have got no response. Did I dream all this marketing?Anyway, I will continue my hunt another day for the sandwich. Today, I substituted for a Stuffed Slice of pepperoni and sausage from Bella Napoli Bella Napoli, a fantastic pizza joint. If you go, try their mozzarella en carrozza, it's amazing.

I just called my local Subway and the person who answered the phone had no idea what I was talking about and said that he never heard of them.  We have several people visiting and who were all wanting to try them, too.  I don't know if it was because the clerk could barely speak English or probably most likely, Subway hasn't educated their employees.  Right now Jared is probably in hiding.

Haha- anon., I feel your pain... My hope for you is that you do find a Subway that both actually has them in stock and realizes it!If you're in NYC, and Subway doesn't work out for huge sandwiches, perhaps take them to Jackson Hole.  Their burgers are impressively big.  Or perhaps to Nick's (UWS), who has 2lb burgers.

I offer you guys my wisdom, if you want to have heart attack on a braided bun, you can come to the subway on 35th street between 8th and 9th ave, yes I know its in the heart of shitty midtown but they have them, know what they are and know how to make them.  In fact we are running a bet in my office that a certain coworker can't eat the foot long version of the above mentioned feast, I will be of course video taping it, and it will be on youtube in the near future. If you all would like i could post a link when it becomes available.

7/17 anon,Yes, that'd be great if you could post the link... When I finally did first have the sandwich, they had some special braided bread, it was about 6-8 inches long.  However, more recently I went back and had another (the steak & cheese), it was cut from a longer braided bread (12-13 inches?).  I have to imagine that eating the full sandwich will be an awesome feat, and we will definitely feature a story on you and your co-workers at it!  Let us know when it's available.

Foie Gras Linked to Diseases

For those of us who love foie gras (yum!), today Wikinews reports terrible news. A recent study links foie gras consumption with Alzheimer's, arthritis, diabetes, and other diseases. The article is a bit light on details, but generally I'm not too surprised, but sad. Good thing I can't afford to eat it every day.

While Foie Gras does taste amazing, I stopped eating it after not being able to reconcile the fact that I was eating an animal's dirt filter...In a related note; the prevalence of those diseases is probably linked to all the hormones, pesticides, and other chemicals we expose our foods to... check out this campaign.

If you are willing to wait on a long line, you can have one of the best desserts in NY. While Shake Shack Shake Shack was dubbed best burger by New York Magazine, it's the concretes (their name for a frozen custard blended with home-made mix-ins) that are the BEST! You can choose one of their concrete combinations or make up your own.My favorite is the blueberry pie (seasonal fruit pie) with Vanilla frozen custard.

Rafiqi's is Poodoo
CONTENT
You've probably seen them around the city... Rafiqi's carts (link is to StreetGrub.com, a great site to know about), they're seemingly everywhere, I know of at least six locations (and I think I spotted one in an outer borough the other day). Big carts, usually with a raised stand for their crew (of 2 or even three people) to stand on, red & yellow signage. They sell the basic NYC street food: middle-eastern style lamb gyro & chicken, hot dogs, and Italian sausage. I've now eaten at three of the stands: Park Ave & 24th Street (in front of CSFB); Park Ave & 32nd Street (in front of Citibank); and 5th Ave & 14th Street (in front of the New School).Now that I'm a Rafiqi's expert (I even know that rafiqi means \"friend\" in Arabic) I'm ready to talk about them: they suck. There are so many awesome street vendors around NYC, do not go to Rafiqi's! Except for today, when I went to the one at Park & 32nd, the others have given smaller portions than any other street vendor I've tried. At least they only charge slightly more than other street vendors...However, their food is worse too. Their pita is thinner and not as tasty as other random vendor's I've tried; I couldn't spy what brand they use, but I didn't like it- or maybe they just over cook it? Their chicken is cut into ragged, nasty chunks of uneven size with no flavor and a chewiness that compares directly to pure fat or perhaps soft rubber. I'll give them that their gyro meat itself tastes fine, but they probably buy it pre-made and still mange to ruin it by cutting it poorly.When I order a platter I'm hoping for salad and rice; I usually pay a bit extra for the pita to be thrown in. I love that most other vendors chop the pita into triangles, to fit nicely in the container, and be easier to eat with a plastic fork and knife. Rafiqi's doesn't do that and they only give a fork and three thin napkins. Further their rice is over-cooked and has no flavor, although today mine did contain exactly one pea and one dice of carrot (seriously)! The salad is actually just lettuce with one slice of tomato, I'm not sure if that counts as salad.And lastly, their yogurt sauce has no flavor; I think it literally is just yogurt in a squeeze bottle. And their hot sauce is pathetic.So far, my favorite two street vendors that offer competing food are first the guy at 14th street & Park Ave, on the NE corner, in front of the supermarket (the one that's usually closer to Park; I think there's a second a bit further East along 14th). And, second, \"(The Famous 53rd and 6th) Halal Foods\", which seems to be busiest around Midnight.p.s. \"Poodoo\" is an expletive on Tatooine (I'm a geek) that means what it sounds like.

Top Secret Recipes

Oh boy... it's the secret recipe site! There's been countless (useless) news stories on TV about how Todd Wilbur figured out the recipe for Pizza Hut or Krispy Kreme or Vitamin Water, and usually I forget about it. By the way, he's been on Food Network quite a few times. But sometimes those recipes are handy to know. Large companies often figure out little secrets that make food taste great, which can be leveraged in everyday cooking. Well at Top Secret Recipes (.com), they've got the list!From 7-Eleven Cherry Slurpee to York Peppermint Pattie there are over 370 recipes to read through, so this site is going to take a while.THE CATCH: Unlike the motto of the 'net (free=good), at Top Secret Recipes, not everything is free. It looks like about 20% of the recipes are free to review, the others seem to cost about 79 cents, a good deal by me. So, while I don't mind the pricing, I hate that they use Flash to block copying the text. Ugh, DRM wins out over functionality.

Spice Noodle
CONTENT
For Stephen's birthday, we hung out at his place and ordered in. Stephen chose to order from Spice Noodle, Spice Noodle a Thai place they ordered from before. It's a good thing we were full from chips and spinach dip because they forgot Stephen's curry dish (which they realized themselves so it was brought over fairly quickly) and Lon and I thought the food was pretty terrible.I ordered a beef Pad See Yu, which is already the ultimate safety dish, and it was terrible. The pieces of beef were so tough (kinda like jerky) and it lacked any flavor beyond soy sauce and sugar. Lon got an appetizer that was so flavorless. There was some rice and minced chicken and pepper wrapped in banana leaf but all the ingredients tasted like they were boiled in plain water separately and then pressed together. It came with an excessively sweet peanut sauce. His main course was fried spare ribs that were also very one dimensionally flavored. This place is the Thai equivalent of crappy Chinese take-out.

Latin Napoleon for Breakfast
CONTENT
This morning I opened our fridge and thought about what I could concoct for Jessica who was still sleeping (long training yesterday for a marathon). I pulled out half an onion, a yellow pepper (that Jess had already cleaned and cored), some lox, corn tortillas, mayo, and recaito.After dicing the yellow pepper, finely dicing the onion, and chopping the lox; I tossed them together. Setting them aside, I then set to work on the dressing. I whisked about a tablespoon of mayo with a teaspoon of recaito. Then as I continued whisking, I thinned the dressing with Champagne & Strawberry Vinegar. Finally I seasoned it with garlic powder and black pepper.In a shallow pan, I started heating about 1/8 cup of vegetable oil over medium heat. Meanwhile, I got out some corrugated, circular cookie cutters (that also make for great alliteration), and cut rings from the corn tortillas. From two six-inch tortillas, I got six 2.5″ rings and two 2″ rings. I fried the tortilla cut-outs for about 15-20 seconds per side and then sprinkled them with table salt while they drained on paper towel.Finally, to assemble these treats, I spread a bit of the dressing on the plate where each stack would go (to hold them in place) and placed the darkest, large cut-out on each. Then I started stacking the lox filling and a cut-out (with some of the dressing on it). And I topped it with the smaller cut-out.The results were delicious and beautiful! New Yorker's will appreciate the raw onion in the lox (a classic combo here), otherwise a green onion might serve better, as it's a bit tamer and adds more color. Have a fun Sunday!

Candle Cafe
CONTENT
Last night, we had dinner with Emily (a vegetarian) at Candle Cafe, Candle Cafe a casual vegetarian restaurant with a fine dining sister restaurant called Candle 79.We started with the Meze Platter, which was delicious! The three of us wolfed down the baba ganoush, tabouli, and hummus which came with an amazing bread. It was like a non-oily version of scallion pancakes (from Chinese restaurants). We requested more of the bread to finish up the spreads and this time, it came nice and warm. Yummm!Lon ordered the Seitan Parmesan Sandwich which he really enjoyed, especially the bread. Emily and I each took a bite and Emily liked it more than I did. Emily ordered the Chipotle Grilled Tofu. The plate was beautifully presented with avocado, greens, and a pile of quinoa. We all thought the tofu was excellent. I felt adventurous and went with our waiter's recommendation, the Grilled Seitan Steak, even though I didn't remember if I liked seitan. I didn't love it but finished the whole plate anyway, including all the broccoli and nicely cooked potato wedges. Lon ordered a side of Mexican Cornbread that came with a peanut-flavored spread. It was too dry and the cornbread flavor didn't go well with the peanut spread, which was tasty on it's own.Lon had been to Candle Cafe a couple of years back and remembered that the dessert was really good. Somehow ended up with three, and they were all giant! We ordered the strawberry rhubarb pie (a seasonal treat at Candle Cafe), the Decadent Chocolate Cake, and the Banana Cake. We all agreed that the chocolate was the winner. The strawberry rhubarb was a close second and the banana cake fell way behind. The cake was a bit dry and the frosting had that artificial banana taste.Overall, it was a good experience for all of us. Candle Cafe is not perfect but the prices are just right and I saw lots of interesting dishes go by while I was eating. You leave feeling very full, but very clean; not that oily heavy feel after eating a big Mexican meal. We want to try Candle 79 next.

Pizza is My Kryptonite
CONTENT
After Superman arrived on Earth, he had a special relationship with Kryptonite, the remnants of his home world. The green crystals called out to Kalel, beckoning; but there was danger. In the light of the yellow sun, Kryptonite causes severe problems for Superman, weakening him to mere mortal, or less. Pizza is my Kryptonite!The magic red sauce, white cheese, and brown crust beckon me, \"Come hither!\" And I'm drawn in. And yet, the highly caloric, oiled-up, lactose loaded disc causes me severe problems. From packing on pounds, to causing my skin to break out, and my stomach to feel ill (I'm lactose intolerant). But I can't stop, it may be my all around favorite food.Pinch Pinch,For lunch today, I ate with Sal and Marc at Pinch a.k.a. Pizza by the Inch. It's not the only pizza joint in Manhattan that sells other than by the slice, for example, Pie, which sells by the pound. At Pinch, you get a pizza that's about four-five inches wide, and as long as you want (four-inch minimum). They say about five inches equals a traditional slice, which makes them a bit more expensive than most other places, but as I'm about to describe, it's worth it.Actually, at first I was skeptical. We split a 24″ pizza that was setup to change toppings every six inches; it had hot sausage, \"Pinch\" chorizo, anchovies, and fresh smoked mozzarella. Normally, I don't care for smoked, fresh mozzarella, but in this situation, it was the best topping! The chorizo was nothing special, but still delicious, as were the other toppings. It's a thin crust pizza, absolutely Napolitan style (this shape and size is also available at Numero 28).We also ordered a Caesar Salad with real Anchovies in it. It was delicious, not overly dressed, and not too many croutons. And a good size portion. The three of us were stuffed and the meal cost $34 with tax & tip; not bad. Next time I go back (and I will!), I'm going to try their pastas. I saw a few orders at other tables, and they look incredible. Plus the staff was chatty and friendly. Beware though, by 12:30 this place is packed.Imperial Pizza Imperial PizzaWhen I got back to the office, my colleagues had left over a few pizzas and some wings in the kitchen. Even though I was full, I was drawn in, if you're confused, since I mentioned I was full, you clearly didn't read what I mentioned about pizza and kryptonite. All three pizzas were thin crust, square, and had fresh mozzarella. I tasted the one that had meatball and ham. In all fairness, the pizza had gotten a bit cold, but that didn't affect me. And frankly, I've eaten enough cold pizza to know a good from a bad.Generally, Imperial was decent: thick cuts of meatball, and nice slices of ham. The fresh mozz. was nice too. So, feel free to give their pizza a shot. But I prefer Libretto's Libretto's Pizzain that neighborhood. Also, Imperial's buffalo wings looked pathetic.

Wandering in to the kitchen at a client this morning, to retrieve my semi-frozen Vitamin Water from the freezer (we just bought two cases from Costco!), I discovered a black box on the counter filled with sweeties. The writing on the box, as shown to the right, was Cyrillic, and I assumed either Russian or Greek. Diving right in, as is my style, I chomped up one of the great looking chocolates. Wow it was good!Being as generous as I am, I immediately shared the exciting news about the hazelnutty-flavored, truffle-like candies with my co-workers. Sal was the first to try one, he spit it out. His distaste for the item was incomprehensible for me, so I ate another one (at least that's the excuse I'm going with). Again it was an incredible experience for me. The inside is a soft truffle of hazelnut and praline bits. The outside is a thin, crisp coating of semi-dark chocolate.I tried to search google for \"Berip 3oromuu\", which is what the Cyrillic lettering looked like, but in English it would be pronounced Vecher Zolotoy. But, then, in a smarter move, I inspected the box further and found the website of AVK, the manufacturer, who turns out to be in the Ukraine. I guess next time you go to the Ukraine, look for these so you can enjoy my bliss (as you can see from the pic above, it seems most people agree with my take, not Sal's).

15 East - Dinner
CONTENT
Lon had a positive experience at 15 East 15 East when he went for lunch with Steve & Justin. Of course when he told me about it, I insisted on going. We decided to try dinner this past weekend and although it was a generally enjoyable meal, we both felt that it was way over-priced.The amuse bouche was described to us as a tomato tofu but it was much more of a block of tomato gelee. I really did not like it!!! It was actually a bit nauseating. We decided on 2 entrees to split, the sashimi omakase, and the Salmon 5 Ways. It's a good thing we weren't that hungry because the sashimi portion was minuscule. It came with an average soup (clear broth with some mushrooms and a shrimp ball) and 10 very small pieces of sashimi. It was very good quality sashimi but not the best I've had and definitely not worth $55. The Salmon 5 Ways included poached salmon, a wet smoked salmon, salmon sashimi, salmon skin (on top of a nicely seasoned rice ball with black sesame), and salmon roe. This was a nice portion size (but not big) and both entrees were displayed very nicely.Overall, the service was average. The decor is average. The food is good (but some dishes have small portions) . The end result is that it's not worth it's prices and we won't be going back.

Dumpling Nazi
CONTENT
There's a dumpling stand in the Flushing Mall Flushing Mall that specializes in dumplings and a couple of noodle soups. They're not located in the food court area, but in lot number M38 of the shopping portion of the shoddy mall. They don't have an English name (I'm calling them Dumpling Nazi.) and I'm pretty sure the people behind the counter don't speak any English. You have to fight for a table since there's no wait staff service and the Dumpling Nazi's aren't at all customer service oriented. Watch out if you're sharing dishes and need some extra plates or bowls. They may charge you for the extra Styrofoam depending on their mood. BUT, they do have good dumplings at good prices (around $7 for a plate of 18). I recommend the classic pork & chive. The dumpling dough is fantastic and they come in the perfect bite size. Yummm....

A Night on the (Food) Town: Boqueria & Big Daddy's
CONTENT
Last night, Jessica and I celebrated two of her cousin's birthdays (Olivia and Christina), and just hung out.BoqueriaBoqueria Boqueria on 19th, having heard good things and noticed that it's frequently busy. Because we went early, around 6, we had no problem grabbing a table for four, tucked away in a corner. I commented on the great tile work and other decoration and Jessica mentioned that a tapas joint with this much light is rare. Well, apparently, the trade off for light is losing quiet. It was so loud by the time we left I couldn't hear anything across a 2.5-foot table. That's ok I guess, as none of us had anything good to say.The menu at Boqueria is well written and we had no problem finding enticing items amongst plates ranging from $4 to $12 for tapas and up to $30 for large dishes. Our waitress was nice, but she told use about the specials in the same, annoying way many restaurants do: right as you're ready to order.We selected three tapas plates, one medium plate, and one large plate. The first to arrive was the Cojonudo: fried quail eggs and chorizo on toast. The flavor of the egg and chorizo was good, albeit unseasoned, but the toast they served it on was terrible. Speaking of terrible bread, when I ordered the 18-month Jamon Serrano, I asked for a plate of house bread. The ham showed up, shortly after the Cojonudo, I asked two more waiters for bread before it arrived. I then had to separately ask for olive oil, and then separately for salt and pepper. The ham itself had great flavor, but was cut so poorly off the leg that pieces ranged from 1/4″ thick to paper thin shreds. The house bread they brought (late) to accompany was from a 2″ wide baguette that tasted like chewy nothingness.Next our plate of Txipirones arrived. It was a salad of baby squid, wild arugula, garbanzo, olive, radish, and citrus aioli. This was probably the best dish, although the salad was heavily dressed and the aioli was basically pure mayonnaise. The olives in this dish also reminded me of medicine, but the squid was good.And about a minute later the special: sea bass in beignets with a gerken aioli. These incredibly fried five balls of fish chunks offered little taste and the gerken aioli didn't help.We realized that we had not ordered enough bad food at this point, so Jessica asked the waitress for a plate of Datiles con Beicon y Almendras. When the dates stuffed with almonds and Valdeon, wrapped in bacon arrived the three pieces were scarfed down, even though they were jet black. The Valdeon overpowered the date completely and even the bacon. It tasted like pure goat cheese and didn't have the tang of blue that would've cut the fat so well. There was also no dressing, perhaps a balsamic would've been good. This mediocre offering was about the best dish.Finally the main dish, Paella Valenciana: bomba rice, chicken, shrimp, chorizo, clams, and saffron. They didn't list oil on the menu as a key ingredient, but based on the pool of it in the serving pan, they should have. The oddly tomatoey tasting rice had no flavor and no hint of saffron. The two prawn atop the plate were perfectly cooked and enjoyable. The clams and mussels (not listed in the ingredients) were cooked just to the point where the flavor was gone, but at least they were edible. The chicken was dried out, shredded, and then soaked in the oil. At least the chorizo bits were enjoyable, but how could anyone screw that up? I shouldn't be too surprised, I've talked about how bad NYC paella is in the past.Overall the portions were small, the joint was loud, the service so-so, and the food was bad. We won't be going back to Boqueria. As we walked towards Park Avenue, on our way for some dessert, we passed Sala 19 and Pipa, we cried as those would've been far better choices!Big Daddy's Diner Big Daddy's Diner We got to Park Avenue and went in to Big Daddy's for some dessert. As usual the place was hopping with activity. We were seated promptly and our sweet waitress answered a few questions we had.Jessica and I shared a Cookie 'n' Cream Super Moist Layered Cake. It arrived fast and the plate was decorated with four dollops of soft whip cream. The cake was insanely sweet, but tasty.I also ordered Daddy's Dr. Pepper Float. Having never combined the Pepper with rich, Vanilla ice cream, it was worth a try. I loved it! Jessica doesn't like Dr. Pepper, she thinks it tastes like medicine (a complaint I've heard from others). Olivia thinks it tastes like toothpaste. And Christina doesn't drink soda. \"Ah... all to myself,\" I thought!As we ate and spoke, Jessica spotted some fries going by, so we ordered a plate. Big Daddy's has good fries, they're cut and cooked Burger King style and they only managed to last a few minutes on our table- although I did steal a few to dip in the fudge sauce- yum.---As a side note, as I was linking to these restaurants, I couldn't help but notice that both have designed Flash sites. I'm glad to see restaurants spending some money online these days.

Lunch?
CONTENT
I just started working at 111 Broadway (corner of Pine Street) and lunch stinks! Here's the couple of places I've gone or ordered in from, mainly by just following the lead of co-workers:Cordato's Cordato's - This is an average deli. They give nice large portion of salad but the only vinaigrette they have is something they call Italian. It's really some red wine vinegar with a nasty corn or canola oil. Who dresses salad with corn/canola oil? Gross!Win Won Win Won - All time worst Chinese food I've ever eaten. I got a beef noodle soup. The noodles were over-cooked, the beef tasted like fatty pork, and the stock was only very slightly better than a bullion cube stock. All the food just looked nasty too!Panini & Co. Panini & Co Cafe - Another mass production sandwich/salad shop, except this one has a really obnoxious cashier. When I went to pay, there was no one behind me so I decided to give the cashier exact change. She starts screaming loudly to the idle (because there were no other customers paying at the time!!!) cashier next to her, \"Why are women so slow? The men pay fast. OMG, come on, come on.\" Geez, I didn't realize there was such a rush to going back to being idle. I won't ever bother them again.There's also some healthy (supposedly) place called Natural something....Ann Marie likes the veggie burgers so I decided to try their spinach burger. Man, was it DEEP FRIED. I hate when places falsely market themselves as healthy. Just cause a ton of oil is sitting in a whole wheat pita, they think they can call that healthy. Here's the bigger problem. They think that by marketing themselves as healthy, it gives them license to not taste as good. So I finished eating feeling really jipped.The trucks and carts with gyros, falafels, and chicken over rice are my best bet so far. None of them are great near me but it's decent and cheaper than anything else I've found so far. Actually, I get my coffee in the morning from the guy in the tin box on the corner of Broadway (west side) and Pine. He's my favorite vendor so far. It's good, hot coffee, from a friendly guy that follows my instructions - 1 sugar, half & half....and after the first couple of days, he remembered that I didn't want a bag.Please someone, post a comment if you know of good food in the area. Save me!

White Wensleydale
CONTENT
Whenever I'm at Whole Foods (or any market), I feel like I have to pass by the cheese department. Sometimes I just like to look at the cheeses and read a couple of descriptions. But, one of my favorite hobbies is to pick a cheese on sale that I've never tried before. Yesterday, Wensleydale caught my eye and I asked the cheese guy what Wensleydale was similar to. He paused and said, \"not much.\" I thought he just couldn't think of anything as he offered a piece to me to try. He was right. It didn't taste like any other cheeses. The texture was like a cheddar but crumbly. It was light with lots of subtle flavors and on the salty side (which I like). I was instantly sold.So far, I've been eating it by itself. I just can't resist pulling a chunk out every time I pass by the fridge. It seems like a great addition to a cheese plate, and probably pairs well with cheese and/or crackers as well.Try it!

A Quick Lunch at Umi Sushi
CONTENT
We stepped out for a quick lunch today and walked a whopping half block over to 31st, between Park and Lex, to try out Umi Sushi Umi Japanese. I had noticed it once or twice before, and it was time to give it a taste.The prices were good, $6.95 for a lunch bento: Sal had the tuna teriyaki, which I felt was cooked poorly, but then again, tuna does not make for good teriyaki. And $6.95 for sushi lunch special: two maki rolls, miso soup, and a salad; or an additional roll for $9.95. I opted for the latter: trying out a yellowtail and scallion roll, white tuna roll, and the most interesting, a spicy crawfish and avocado roll. The fish was fresh at this small establishment. The hamachi was decent in flavor, but the roll was poorly assembled and the last two pieces fell apart. The white tuna was perfect. And the crawfish, which also had tempura flakes in it, was fantastic- although it didn't taste much like crawfish.Overall, I was happy with the rapid service, good prices, and fresh fish at tiny Umi Sushi, I'll be back.

Krispy Kreme's Loss Widens

No!!!!! Early this morning Sal sent me terrible news: Krispy Kreme's loss is widening!. About a year ago my colleagues and I debated who offers the best doughnuts in the city. Most of us in the know, agreed that truly Doughnut Plant had the best, but in a wider net than the L.E.S., the answer was Krispy Kreme; although some descenters did seem to love Dunkin' Donuts.Well, excitingly, KK seems to be pushing back aggressively by offering a new product line: Ice Kreme! They say they will be offering their own ice cream in cups, cones, and shakes and the form I'm most looking forward to sampling: the doughnut sundae!

I've been sick for the past couple of days so I haven't eaten anything exciting but wow do saltine crackers taste good when you're sick. I polished off a lot (1 out of 4 sleeves in the larger box) while watching TV horizontally last night. I think it's pretty amazing that they taste buttery and the texture is flaky, even when there's no butter in the ingredients list. I don't know if I should be scared about the chemicals that replaced the butter or happy that it's only 1.5 grams of fat per serving. It sure is good with some ginger ale when you have a fever.

Monkfish & Chinese Food Safety
CONTENT
The FDA has issued temporary warning to avoid consuming Monkfish. There are some people out there, like my Mom who coincidentally mentioned it this past weekend, who won't eat Monkfish (a.k.a Goosefish) because they think it contains toxins- it doesn't. What is risky is eating Pufferfish (a.k.a. \"fugu\" in sushi parlance). Pufferfish contains tetrodotoxin, which has no antidote and results in a terrible death from respiratory failure.Well it turns out that the real danger, is not really in eating either, but rather lies in dealing with humans- because we're dumb and make lots of mistakes. The reason for the current problem seems to be that someone has mislabeled this China-imported Pufferfish, containing toxins, as Monkfish.Is it me or does China seem to be having tons of trouble with food and food safety lately? We've seen pet food recall, poisonous toothpaste, and endangered species on the menu- that's just in the last few weeks! No surprise that the ex-chief of food and drug safety in China got the death penalty?

Being 70-year-old alter kockers (trapped in 20-somethings' bodies) we argued over who ate there first, that was our work out to build an appetite.Justin satiated his appetite with the chocolate chip in the sugar cone for which he received my utmost ridicule. Who goes to an Asian-inspired ice cream shop and passes over the ginger, sesame, taro, wasabi, and 20 other distinctive flavors for the plain jane? I went for two scoops in a cup- one mango and the other honeydew.

Beer and Cheese by Garrett Oliver, at Brooklyn Brewery
CONTENT
Roger's brother just happens to be Garrett Oliver, the Brewmaster of Brooklyn Brewery The Brooklyn Brewery and author of The Brewmaster's Table.Roger scheduled a special tasting for one of our clients, Restaurant Associates, on Thursday afternoon and I was fortunate enough to attend amongst a roster of top industry professionals. As we waited for two more guests to arrive, Garrett poured each of us a glass of a light summer ale (I don't remember the name, as it was before the actual tasting) that was wonderfully refreshing.Garret started with a little background, explaining the brewing process while giving us a little tour of the brewery. There is a lot to learn but Garret has a great speaking style that is casual and welcomes questions. I recommend hearing him. After being armed with some basics, we took our seats and each received a plate of 5 cheeses and crackers in the center. Garret explained that the pairing of beer and cheese goes way back and is surprisingly touted by many experts as a better pairing than cheese with wine.The pairings were excellent! Here is a little breakdown of our tasting:1. Blanche de Chambly with Cypress Grove Humboldt Fog2. Brooklyn Local 1 with Pierre Robert3. Spaten Munich Optimator with Ossau-Iraty4. Brooklyn East India Pale Ale with Coolea5. Black Chocolate Stout with a blue cheese (similar to Stilton)Highlights:*Blanche de Chambly with the Humboldt Fog was my favorite pairing but Humboldt Fog is also one of my all time favorite cheeses.*Brooklyn Local 1 is amazing! It's the champagne of beers.*I'm not a fan of the Ossau-Iraty's texture which is a bit granular.*The Black Chocolate Stout is really interesting because it really has dark chocolate qualities. Garret recommends having it with dessert.The Brooklyn Brewery has happy hours and gives tours!

Glaceau Interest Acquired by Coca Cola
CONTENT
Ok, I know we're not here to talk finance... but, since I just wrote about Vitamin Water (the primary brand from Glaceau) and I've mentioned the energy drink market before, this seems relevant. Yesterday, Tata Tea, in an impressive show of investment savvy, sold their 30% stake in Glaceau to Coca Cola for USD$1.2 billion, giving them roughly a 77% return in under 10 months and allowing them to potentially clear the debt from one of their major brands, Tetley.Personally, I'm not excited about this sale. Glaceau products are wonderful because of their independent style. This is apparent in the ingredients in their products, the flavors they release, and the marketing (even the writing on the bottles themselves). If Coca Cola leaves them alone, or perhaps only aids in better, more efficient distribution, hopefully the product will maintain it's quality. But if Coca Cola pushes for more profit through terrible ingredients like the ones they put in their own products, all the current Glaceau fans are going to suffer.

Chockylit is Cheryl Porro from San Fran, CA and here's what I know so far: Cheryl works in tech during the day (like me) and food at night. She has published recipes and includes many of her experiments online for us to enjoy. While I haven't yet tried her recipes -- I will though -- I have enjoyed the photographs on the web site (which she makes also).So look for upcoming reviews of her recipes, as Jessica and I will be giving them a run, possibly in the new mini-muffin bake pan we just acquired from Calphalon.

Ten Sushi, 31st Street
CONTENT
There's rarely a restaurant where I won't be eager to try. But of all types of restaurants, the ones that usually give me pause are sushi joints. Unlike pizza, there is such a thing as bad sushi, so you can't blame me for pausing before wandering into Ten Sushi on East 31st Street Ten Sushi for lunch today. It's a small side street, with lots of construction happening, and they have a small door. But, I did go in, and I'm glad I did! I'll share my experience with you, and if you go try it, you'll be glad I did as well.When you first walk in, you'll immediately be hear the standard greeting and then notice that it looks like every other sushi joint in Manhattan, except that there is an eerie, blue glow. After a while your eyes adapt, but at first you'll feel like you're in The Matrix, except it's blue, not green.After a quick review of the menu, which had some interesting looking rolls on it, I ordered the sashimi bento box; Sal ordered a lunch special along with a scallop nigiri and salmon roe nigiri; and Travis ordered a shrimp teriyaki. All of our portions were perfect, if not slightly large, for lunch. I noticed Travis' plate had nine good sized shrimp on it, definitely a good portion. Also noticeable was the cut of Sal's scallop nigiri- they looked so good I was going to order some, but figured I had enough food.My sashimi bento was enjoyable. The fish were standard size and definitely fresh. The gyoza were freshly steamed and while I'm sure they were, they didn't actually taste like they had just come out of a frozen package. The only upsetting part of the experience was that they wouldn't allow me to pay to upgrade from the standard California roll to one with fish in it. Happily the Cali roll turned out to be large and delicious with very fresh avocado inside.All in all, the meal was enjoyable and I'll definitely go back.

Brined, Roasted Turkey
CONTENT
While growing up, my family ate turkey. And by that, you shouldn't think we ate turkey on a holiday here or there; no, my mom was cooking at least six turkeys a year- which maybe doesn't sound like a lot, but think of how many times you've cooked a turkey, or your family cooks them. This post is all about how useful turkey cooking skill is.When I first moved out, turkey was one of the few things I cooked regularly. It's pretty cheap and very easy to cook. I know some people get all carried away with cooking time by weight and basting and stuffing, but there is a simple way too. My mom usually bought 12-14lb turkeys, because those are what were usually readily available. To cook a turkey of this size is simple:Instructions for Simple Turkey RoastingHow easy is that!? You can fancy it up by placing aromatic veggies (onions, carrots, garlic, bay leaves, etc.) inside the cavity, but it's not necessary.Now if you want to step it up a notch, let's talk about brining! This is my first time brining a turkey and I did a bit of research beforehand to come up with a winning brine recipe. After having done it and tasted it, Jessica and I agree, this is the best roasted turkey either of us have ever eaten. So please delight yourself with this great, new recipeInstructions for Brined, Roasted TurkeyBrineAnd, of course, a turkey! I used a 12.5lb turkey, unkosher turkey.Place water and ingredients (not turkey) in a large pot and bring to a boil. Remove from heat and allow to cool thoroughly. Add poultry, cover and brine for 24 hours. I did this is in a huge plastic container I had, but if you don't have one, I suggest using a huge plastic bag, and then keeping that in a pan so it doesn't leak. In this case, I brined for 18 hours, because that timing worked better for me.After brining, remove the turkey from the brine and dry it thoroughly with paper towels. Then set it back in the fridge for up to 6 more hours. Your goal here is to allow time for the brined protein to absorb any excess water from the skin. In my case I only did this for three hours, because, again, that timing worked for me.Finally, I pre-heated my oven to 500 deg F, dried off the turkey once more, and cut an onion in half and shoved that into the cavity. You can put as much or as little in there as you like, but I think at least an onion is a good idea. Also if you want to tie the turkey, now is the time. I did, but you don't have to. Then put it on a rack, in a roasting pan, and pour half an inch of water in the pan. Cook for 30 minutes.Reduce the oven temp to 350 deg F, cover the turkey breasts with heavy aluminum foil or two layers of it, insert a thermometer, and continue cooking. Make sure to insert the thermometer into the thickest part of the breast. We're looking for an internal temperature of 161-165 deg F, which for this size turkey is about another 100 minutes of cooking.When it's done, remove it from the oven, remove thermometer, and spread the aluminum foil to loosely cover the entire bird. About 30-45 minutes later it's ready for carving.This will literally be the best roast turkey ever. (Fried Turkey is even better though)

That recipe looks awesome, but there is a huge problem with brined turkeys that I just can't get over: You can't use the drippings for gravy, because they're too salty. And how can you have turkey without gravy?  What did you do?
Lon
2007-05-31 07:14:00
Sue- Usually I'd make gravy from the drippings, but this time I cooked the bird late at night and was too tired.  So I can only give a general guess and advice for now.My brined bird gave off far more (both in quantity and quality) drippings than any other bird I've cooked. Since brining reduces water content, the drippings will be concentrated, including, as you said, lots of the brine salt and sugar.  When I make gravy, I usually put a lot of salt, because I've found people like that, and in a thick, syrupy gravy most don't even notice it and just enjoy it.So to hit the right balance of salt I would perhaps use less percentage of drippings to stock, wine, or water (or whatever you use to extend your gravy).  You could also throw a few potato wedges into the gravy while it's simmering- they will cut down the salt level dramatically.There's two ways to go from there: you could pull the wedges out before serving (if you roast them after they'll make a great chef snack) or you could boil them in unsalted water beforehand and don't use as much thickening agent in your gravy and then blend in some/all of the potatoes to thicken.  Could be an interesting take?Let me know if you try it, I will as well next time!

Burger Joint
CONTENT
The place informally known as Burger Joint Burger Joint, hidden in Le Parker Meridien, seems so out of place in a fancy hotel. Yet, they manage to get long lines of people waiting for their very limited menu: burger, cheeseburger, grilled cheese, fries, brownies, and milkshakes. I think that's it (with some other beverages). They have signs up to tell you how to order and a sign that says, \"We don't spit in your food so please don't write on our walls.\"Becky, Lon, and I decided to try our luck tonight and the line was actually short. Lon thinks it gets busier at night, but I think the drastic price increase may have something to do with it. Since this Daily News article was written, prices have gone up to $6.50 (hamburger), $7 (cheeseburger), and $3 for french fries.The burgers are good for a regular sized burger. It's cooked correctly, tastes like it's grilled, and the toppings are fresh. The french fries are thin and crispy, just the way I like them. It's a bar-like atmosphere and you have to seat yourself after you get your food at the counter.I'm glad I experienced Burger Joint once but now I'm over it.

Vitamin Water: b-relaxed
CONTENT
This is not my first post about energy drinks, but it is my first post where I focused on a specific flavor. On Wednesday I discovered \"b-relaxed\" flavor Vitamin Water. It is jackfruit and guava, and wow does it hit the spot for thirst. While the intense, natural sweetness of this new flavor makes it hard for me to imagine anyone relaxing, the overall effect is dead on.You will absolutely feel like you're drinking the perfect blend of guava's body and jackfruit's refreshing tang. In case jackfruit is new to you, it's a particularly popular fruit in Southern Asia, particularly in India and Thailand. Actually, Thailand is where I first experienced it. And just recently again when Jessica's mom brought back some dried jackfruit chips from her Southeastern Asia trip.Anyway, run out to your local bodega and pick up a bottle or ten. I hope you enjoy it as much as we do.

It might taste good but according to Nutrition Action Newsletter June 2008, it really doesn't contain jackfruit or guava - just flavorings. Doesn't do anything good either except add 125 calories. Best for thirst? -plain water.BTW - there aren't enough vitamins in it to do anything except make a big profit for CocaCola.PS According to Nutrition Action the label is illegal because it implies that the fruits are in it.

Wild Salmon Ain't No Farm Raised Fish
CONTENT
UPDATE (1/29/08): WILD SALMON is now closed.My parents wanted to take me out to dinner for my birthday so I chose Jeffrey Chodorow's new place Wild Salmon. It took over the location of English is Italian and looks pretty much the same only they've added copper-colored fish, dangling from the ceiling.We asked for some bread to hold us over while we were waiting for my parents to arrive. It was a delicious flat bread, a cross between pita and pizza dough. It was lightly oiled with a sprinkling of herbs. It came out nice and warm on a fish-shaped wooden tray. After my parents arrived, we had to get another tray of it, which was also devoured.For starters, Lon had the smoked salmon platter - 3 types of smoked salmon and potato latkes topped with creme fraiche and caviar. The whole plate was superb. My dad had the crab and corn chowder which he enjoyed. My mom and brother shared the crab and bay shrimp ravioli which they liked but both Lon and I did not. The pasta part was good but I didn't like the filling. I ordered the half dozen Virginica Totten Inlet oysters which were excellent, super fresh, plump, and juicy.Our waitress informed us that they had a special salmon that was only available for a short time each year (I did some research to verify), the copper river salmon. It definitely sounded like something I had to try given this opportunity. I chose the cedar plank preparation and the morel pinot noir sauce for my entree. It turned out to be an excellent choice. Aside from the fish being cooked properly and really absorbing the cedar plank aroma, the fish had an unbelievable color, texture, and flavor. The copper river salmon is easily distinguishable from regular salmon. I didn't need the sauce. The salmon is great as is. I recommend everyone to go try it. You have until mid-June I think.My dad had the Alaskan King Crab Legs which he said were cooked properly, but nothing special. My mom, brother, and Lon all chose the Northwest Seafood Cioppino. It got sort of mixed reviews from the three of them, but they were generally satisfied. We also got a side of Stuffed Baked Walla Walla Onion for the table. It was nothing special and the inside was under-cooked while the outside was almost over-cooked.For dessert, we shared the Strawberry Rhubarb Crisp, the Baked Alaska (formed to look like an igloo) with truffles (made to look like a penguin), and the Berry Napoleon made with marscapone. The Baked Alaska got the most attention because of its clever artistry. But, my favorite was the Berry Napoleon. The crisp was a bit too wet, but still gobbled up.I probably won't return to this restaurant since the food was a bit inconsistent. The wait staff also needs some polishing. They forgot which dish belonged to who a few times and sometimes cleared dishes at awkward times. I am glad I tried the copper river salmon but I'll try it somewhere else next time.

Maté
CONTENT
Last week Travis, recently back from Argentina, sat next to me drinking a distinctively scented beverage. Literally poking my nose where it doesn't belong I inhaled deeply and then asked about his drink. He informed me that it was maté. I had heard of this tea, but never tried it. Generously, Travis offered me some leaves and home I went... well, after work was over that is.While my well-traveled colleague was using a bombilla (it looks like a straw with a filter on the end), but when I got home I just steeped it and filtered it. After a sip, I realized that my South American friends knew what they were doing when they standardized the drink by adding plenty of sugar. Of course, they also add coca, but since I didn't have any on hand I passed on that step.The tea is a best described as a very subtle-flavored cross of green tea and coffee with a (sorry to sound like a wine taster) strong, Earthy bouquet. Other people online describe the aroma as tobacco or oak. I found that the harsher the brew the more developed the tobacco odor becomes.While maté is not particularly bad, it is far down on the list of teas I'd prefer to drink. Jessica sampled some for herself. I was curious to get her input, since she enjoys green teas and coffees more than I do, but alas, she agreed that it is a boring tea. Not bad, but nothing special. Oh well, back to our local Ten Ren (where we just picked up some fabulous young Keemun black tea for my Uncle's Birthday).

Petite Abeille
CONTENT
After a meeting with John Davis of Creative Edge Parties, Roger and I headed to the Petite Abeille Petite Abeille on Hudson Street for lunch. It's a tiny location with seating for only about 12-15 people. The kitchen is just behind a counter and fully visible to anyone inside the restaurant.We started with some mussels, cooked in white wine with thyme, onion, and celery. It was simple, fresh, and delicious. The broth was excellent and got me to eat more bread which I tried not to since we still had our main dishes coming. Roger had a Cesar Salad with Shrimp. The dressing is made fresh on location and the salad has whole pieces of anchovies. I ordered an omelet with fresh mozzarella, tomato and basil. It came with a little bit of mesculan greens and french fries. I was impressed with the very pretty textbook omelet but disappointed with the fries. I thought this place was known for their fries, no? They weren't hot enough. They weren't crispy enough, and didn't have any memorable quality about them.Generally, I would say that this is a pretty good lunch place. The service is friendly and they have a good selection of lunch items at moderate prices.

A Quick Snack at Galil Moroccan
CONTENT
Sometimes you want a hot beverage to chat over, and in that case Starbucks can be your savior- due to their comfy furniture, not due to their burnt, nasty coffee or overly sweet drinks. So when Bill and I were looking for a place to sit and chat after watching Regis Philbin interview Don Rickles at the 92nd Street Y last night, we headed towards the location at 85th & Lexington Avenue. But literally, with our hand on their door, we looked across the street and decided to sit down at Galil Moroccan instead.Galil Moroccan Galil Moroccan is a glatt kosher restaurant in a prime neighborhood (read: Jewish). It was buzzing with patrons at 9:30 on a Thursday night. We grabbed a table for two and ordered the Small Combination Platter which includes Hummus, Tehina, Babaganoush, Eggplant, Moroccan Salad, Tabbouli, Carrots, and Beets, I might be forgetting something. They also delivered three piping hot pita to the table. The pita were soft, doughy, and delicious, and again, piping hot. While they don't make them on site, they are fresh from the oven and are great. Each of the salads were more delicious than the other. The tehina was incredibly cream and rich. The babaganoush (which I felt there wasn't enough of) was strong and aromatic. And the tabouli was herbally and crisp. We both really enjoyed it and commented on how it would make a great lunch in and of itself. And at $11.95 it is decent price for glatt kosher. The only downside was the quantity of pita, we really needed one or two more.Afterwards, we both enjoyed some Moroccan Tea and shared Baklava. The baklava wasn't the biggest or best I've had, but it was distinctive and tasted good, but not worth the $5 price tag.Overall, Galil earned my respect for good food. Since it's a few blocks from my sister Kasi who keeps kosher, maybe we'll go back for a full meal.

California Pizza Kitchen
CONTENT
There are few better locations for a moderate-level chain to open than in Upper Murray Hill. So when the folks over at California Pizza Kitchen decided to open a huge restaurant on Park Avenue South and 30th Street, they made a wise choice. The location is filled with various companies ranging from small stores to huge offices and is only a few blocks from the Empire State Building (although, most tourists won't find this location).I wandered in for lunch on Thursday with Sal, it was a day after their grand opening, so at about noon when we walked in we weren't too surprised to see it empty. I cracked a joke to the waitress about the unbelievable number of staff just standing around and thought I was being funny. However, by the time we left, the place was packed and there was a line out the door!After a quick review of the menu, I picked a small Shrimp Scampi pizza (seafood on pizza is such a great combination) and Sal went with a Hawaiian- a seemingly safe bet. Because the pizza was taking a bit longer than expected to arrive, they asked if we wanted bread and brought out a few slices of doughy, but tasteless white bread with cheap, pre-packaged butter. That quickly reminded me I was in a chain.When our pizzas arrived, it was clear to me that the scampi was the winner. And it tasted great too. It was garlicy and oniony and the dough was tender. It was topped with a lemon butter sauce that was tangy and creamy. Sal and I really enjoyed it.The Hawaiian however, was a bit more sorry. The pineapple was overly tangy and the Canadian bacon was chewy with little to offer taste-wise.The price was decent for the amount of food, easily enough for three people, and we were pleased with the food. Just keep in mind that CPK is a chain like any other and you won't be disappointed when you walk in their standardized doors.

Saving the Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookie
CONTENT
Wanting to make cookies one night, I looked for a recipe that would use the ingredients I had at the time. I found a Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookie recipe on AllRecipes.com that had good reviews. I mixed up the batter and started baking them. They came out looking way too dark but tasted good so I tried to play with the next tray by turning off the convection. Bad idea! They spread way too much and became super thin. They were really difficult to remove whole from the cookie sheets too.I brought the better cookies (still too dark) in to work for my co-workers but had several super flat cookies left at home. They did taste good so I didn't want to throw them away... and then I came up with the perfect thing for them.I bought a pint of Stonyfield Farm's Creme Caramel ice cream (too sweet for me) and made ice cream sandwiches. They came out great! The cookies were perfect for ice cream sandwiches because you could bite through them easily so that the ice cream didn't squeeze out. The flavors matched really well and I salvaged the cookies!

Friend of What Farmer?
CONTENT
I've been hearing about Friend of a Farmer from people here and there so I had been meaning to try it. After seeing the not-moving enormous line at Shake Shack, we decided to find another spot with outdoor seating (since Ice was with us).I thought we were so lucky to finally get seats at this seemingly always packed restaurant but now I wish we never got the seats. I was disappointed with the food from beginning to end. I couldn't find an entree that really interested me so I chose 2 appetizers instead. I had the crabmeat stuffed mushrooms which were completely flavorless. The red pepper sauce wasn't even seasoned. My 2nd appetizer was the Parmesan and Herb Crusted Shrimp. The shrimp was over-cooked and served room temperature. The parmesan had hardened onto the shrimp like rubber. (If I pull off cheese and don't eat it, that's a bad sign!) I suppose the shrimp had been hot at some point because it wilted the sparse amount of salad underneath which was gross because it was sitting in a pool of shrimp water and salad dressing mixed together. Lon ordered the Pan-seared Tilapia which actually came breaded and fried, which was not what he wanted but ate. Carol, my fabulous friend and 9 time published cookbook author, had the Shephard's Pie which looked pretty good but tasted more like ketchup-y Sloppy Joe with mashed potatoes on top. She only ate about 1/3 of it.So now I'm bewildered at why so many people all over the web recommend this place. Is it just cool to eat on Irving? Most of the reviews are about their brunch so I hope that's significantly better but now I don't think I'll ever give this place a second chance. Not only was the food poor quality, it wasn't cheap. It was about $25 per person, which is $25 too much to eat at this place.

Rochelle and I have eaten there twice. Why did you remind us? We found the food pretty flavorless. Both times the place was crowded and it felt cramped even by NYC standards. I can't think of anything good to say about this place.

Wu Liang Ye: Authentic Szechuan
CONTENT
Being with Jessica has many advantages. One of these is eating with her folks. Her mom is a wonderful foodie who unlike some traditional Chinese people, is willing to try all cuisines. I was particularly happy when she was quick to recommend the hot dog-bread snack available throughout Europe on our trip last year. Her dad, while not a foodie, has a phenomenal working knowledge of Chinese history and has great tales. So while I've always been able to tell which Chinese restaurants taste good, only now do I know which are authentic.And so, enter Wu Liang Ye. I'm speaking about the one on the west side of Lexington Avenue between 49th & 50th Streets. I have to be specific because I don't believe they're associated with the one 86th street, or the one on 48th &5th that's rated by Zagats, and I honestly doubt they have anything to do with the liquor. (Update 5/2/09 - they now say they are a chain?) Anyway, they're an authentic Szechuan restaurant: us non-Chinese folk can tell their authenticity by the crowd that eats there and that they're Szechuan by the amount of chili oil used in every dish!The first time I went was with Jessica and her family. We tried many dishes including two of my favorites the hong yo swa jao (Dumplings in Chili Oil Vinaigrette) and the Dan Dan Noodles. (fresh noodles with minced pork chili vinaigrette. I was also thrilled to see that they serve Camphor Tea Smoked Duck, which is one of my favorite Chinese dishes; although honestly, theirs is nothing special- but if you've never tried it, give it a shot. We had at least four other dishes including steamed whole fish with ginger and scallions, and we really enjoyed ourselves.Today I went back with Steve for lunch. It was crowded, but not overly packed. We passed over the highly Americanized lunch price fix menu and ordered those dumplings I mentioned and then shared an entree, the Sauteed Beef Filets with String Beans. I love how when they serve the dumplings they stir in some fresh garlic cream. The beef is served with a brown sauce that is perfectly salty and sweet, over the slightly too-oily string beans. The beef is sauteed to rare in cornstarch to thicken it. It was about $20 with tax & tip for lunch, what a steal for some great Chinese in midtown.

Hungry and Frustrated: FoodStamps
CONTENT
Speaking of mayhem! NY1's NY1: Top Story about Queens Councilman Eric Gioia trying to live on food stamps really exposes the chaotic way our welfare-related policies are structured. The story basically says that Gioia couldn't live on the $28 worth of food stamps, which is the average amount alloted (although it doesn't say where this average is for, I would hope NYC is different than Kansas).While this is a blog about food and not politics, I won't go on for too long, but personally I think the entire program needs to be re-worked. It's not too late to go back to the drawing board.

Sal and I were joking about how cool it would be to be able to print ourselves some Krispy Kreme doughnuts- and how whomever invented that technology would be an instant billionaire! Well, the guys over at Evil Mad Scientist haven't made exactly that, but they're well on their way with the 3D Sugar Printer.This thing can generate large volume, three dimensional models at low resolution out of regular granulated sugar. They are lightly caramelized but are so cool (well first hot, then they cool).

Mother's Day
CONTENT
Lon and I made one of our best meals yet for Mother's Day lunch. Both of our moms and Lon's Grandma were the guests of honor; our brothers and my dad were in attendance as well. Everyone seemed to enjoy themselves and my brother claimed it was one of the best lunches he's ever had! I'm sorry to say that we didn't use recipes for most of the lunch, but below we've linked to recipes for any that we did.Seafood Salad on a Bed of Curry SlawThe purple cabbage, green cabbage, and shredded carrots was dressed with a mix of mayonnaise, honey, whole grain mustard, cider vinegar and curry powder. The seafood was a blend of blanched bay scallops and shrimp, steamed and shelled mussels, grilled squid and octopus, all marinated in cider vinegar, shallots, garlic, olive oil, and then tossed with fresh cilantro. The key is that seafood cooks almost instantly: so don't over-cook.Chicken Spring SaladThis was a last minute idea that came together so nicely. I used a romaine base and layered roasted chicken, roasted red onions, maple smoked bacon, chunks of mango, and strips of cucumber. The dressing was made of white balsamic vinegar, honey, whole grain mustard, olive oil, and cumin. The flavors came together so well and the unique combination is now one of my new favorites. The colors also add so much to the presentation: the cucumber and mango balance the darker-colored proteins.Grilled Brook Trout with Pepper RelishLon bought 4 gorgeous butterflied, bone-out, head-on brook trout at Whole Foods that he sprinkled with olive oil and seasoned before placing on a hot grill. While two flipped perfectly, the other two broken up a bit. They still tasted right. A relish of diced yellow bell pepper, finely diced jalapeños, cilantro, garlic powder, onion powder, and olive oil was generously spooned on top. The fish was cooked perfectly: tender and juicy.No-Knead BouleThe bread was incredible. It was devoured so quickly that we wished we had made two! Lon found this recipe that requires very little work, yet it comes out tasting like a bread that you kneaded and worked multiple times. This is our second time making it.SuccotashThe dish we made was based on a recipe from AllRecipes, but we made a couple of changes. Due to availability and taste we used canned butter beans. We didn't start by cooking these in the 1/2 cup of butter that was suggested. Leaving out half the butter made the dish healthier and closer to our taste. Also we grilled the corn on the cob before adding to the recipe. This adds a fantastic layer of taste and aligned with our other grilled items.CinnabonsThis recipe from AllRecipes called for a bread machine, which we don't have, but luckily the two most popular reviews for this recipe gave tips on how to adjust. It came out great; very, very close to Cinnabon. Our only adjustment was to dress with half the icing (it was plenty) and to sprinkle the icing with brown sugar and cinnamon.We also enjoyed a variety of fruits including grapes, bananas, small nectarines. Plus we had two bags of the Green Apple Cotton Candy from our dinner at BLT Fish.At first, I thought the constraints would make this a so-so meal. My mom is allergic to lemon and lime. Lon's mom can't have any onions, (including scallions or shallots) raw; and she is allergi to anything like red wine including red wine and balsamic vinegars. And neither my dad or my brother eat cheese.The entire meal turned out terrific. Everything tasted so good independently and also fit together perfectly as a meal. We used Spring as our theme. Continuous tastes included grilling, seafood, and vegetables; also, most of this was quite healthy. The colors (yellows and oranges) were great and we had some non-alcoholic champagne to top the meal off.I was so pleased with this lunch, I want to make it again!

BLT Fish
CONTENT
The actual restaurant of BLT Fish is on the 3rd floor of the building. The 2nd floor is a private dining space that can be booked for events and the ground floor is a more casual dining experience called The Shack.Luckily, we got the best seat in the house: the corner booth by the open kitchen. I got a great view of every plate coming out and heard all the cues to coordinate their impeccable timing. Our waiter, Dylan, was fantastic. He gave us a quick overview of the menu structure, made a couple of great recommendations, and answered our questions with real knowledge about the restaurants dishes and preparation methods.Soon a complimentary plate of smoked tuna salad with little toasts was presented. Both of us enjoyed it but then it was topped by their next complimentary item, Cheddar and Chive Biscuits. The biscuits were hot and delicious with the most amazing texture; accompanying them was soft butter in maple syrup, which Lon enjoyed and I skipped. They even give you a little card with the recipe.We shared a raw bar sampler platter which was a 2-tiered plate of of tasty shellfish that came with way more than we expected. Large shrimp, 2 types of clams, crab claws, 2 types of snails, mussels, a ceviche, and the most delicious oysters I've ever had. The three sauces were cocktail sauce, a horseradish mayonnaise, and a perfect mignonette sauce. We also added king crab legs to the order which wasn't worth it. The addition of a little king crab leg was $26 and we really liked the standard items more.Next, we shared the Jerk Seasoned Swordfish with 3 sides. The swordfish had a great flavor but was slightly over-cooked. The Parmesan Gnocci (recommended by Dylan, our waiter) had an incredible texture. The soft fluffiness of it made it seem light. I would go back just to have that side. The grilled asparagus was nothing special but the pommes souffle was definitely unique. Souffle is a poor name for it since it's more of a pillow shaped, hollow potato chip. It doesn't taste any better than a good potato chip but the idea and effort required to make it is what's really impressive.While we were waiting for dessert, we asked some waiters about some dishes we saw coming out. The Black Sea Bass and the Red Snapper looked amazing and the waiters were proud to discuss preparation methods and even knew the origin of each fish. Lon and I were really impressed with the staff.We were so full, but decided that we had to try dessert and selected the Red Berry Tart. The tart was nice and light with a nutty crumble and a cheese sorbet on top. We also received a complimentary plate of minis: a macaroon, a pâtes de fruit, and a coconut marshmallow. To top it off, you get a large portion of their signature green apple cotton candy as well as a portion packed for you to take home.BLT Fish is run very much like BLT Prime, except fish is the main attraction as opposed to steak. They like to have complimentary signature starters, some complimentary desserts, and the menus are structured similarly as well. Their plan works and I would gladly go to either restaurant again.For more images, check out our Flickr page.

Numero 28 again!
CONTENT
Since there are always tons of restaurants I want to try, I don't often go back to restaurants I've already been to. When I do, its significant. Numero 28 is one of those places I would recommend to anyone and everyone.We had dinner there last night with Steve and Yael, which was great since we got to try more things. They started with a pear salad and we started with an arugala salad. (The baby arugala was super fresh.) We got two 14″ pizzas and a meat lasagna. One pie was topped with mushroom and artichoke and the other was topped with walnut, potato, and rosemary. The first one was delicious and exactly the way a pizza should be. The 2nd was not only tasty, but so unique! Unique, in a good way, rarely happens anymore. It didn't have a sauce which I prefer but if you like white pizzas, try this one. And I said this when I blogged about them last time but I have to reiterate (in case you don't read the first blog, which I strongly urge you to do), their dough is so good!!!So the one little problem was that parts of the lasagna was cold. Somehow it was unevenly heated, but otherwise one of the best lasagnas I or Lon have had in a NYC restaurant. Great meat sauce, fresh pasta sheets, fresh mozzarella, in good ratios....perfection.This time, we also tried dessert. The Tiramisu was delicious! Steve and Yael shared one; Lon and I shared one. Both were gone in a minute. The waitress was great and Numero 28 is now firmly the go-to pizza place for me.

PS 450 is No Postscript
CONTENT
For lunch today, Sal and I headed over to PS 450, which is really more of a bar than a restaurant, but bars don't make enough money at lunch. We had our choice of sitting at tall tables in the front, the bar in the middle, or sitting essentially on the floor at very short tables in the back. As I despise sitting on stools when I eat, we opted for the uber-low tables in the back room, where only one other group was eating.The atmosphere is lounge-ish and chill at lunch time. The best looking items on the menu all fell under the \"POPS\" section, with items like Mac 'n' Cheese Pops and Braised Short Rib Nachos. However, we stuck to entrees: Sal ordered the Pulled Pork with Strawberry Chipotle BBQ Sauce, Crispy Shallots on Brioche and I ordered the Lobster Roll with tarragon Caviar Aioli and Mache. Both were served with healthy bowls of french fries and both arrived extremely fast.We both started with the fries- wow! These are hands down the best french fries I've had in New York City, possibly ever. We both devoured our entire bowls, each of which would normally be enough for two people. I had mine with mayo and Sal had his with ketchup.I asked Sal how his pork sandwich was, he said it decent, but pointed out that its sauce carries all the flavor and good pulled pork should bring flavor from the pork itself. He also recommends not ordering that sandwich if you intend on keeping your shirt clean.The menu specifically said that my lobster roll contained meat from a 1.25 pound lobster, which was impressive for the relatively low price of $18 (good lobster rolls range in the $20-35 range). In reality, there was about half as much lobster on the roll. And while the lobster salad itself had the perfect amount of aioli, there was not enough total lobster salad to combat the dryness of the bread. The flavor of the tarragon and mache were a nice match for the lobster, but I absolutely could not taste caviar or garlic- after all, it was called aioli. I would say this is absolutely a case of you get what you pay for.In the end I recommend going to PS 450 to get those fries. Based on those, I have to believe that my original guess about those POPS would be correct- I'll have to go back after work one day to find out.

Seoul Garden and Cafe Brama
CONTENT
Seoul Garden is my favorite restaurant in K-town. There are restaurants of equal quality but at higher prices. For around $18 per person, the 6 of us shared 6 dishes plus plenty of pan-chan (traditional Korean side dishes usually given as complimentary). The doenjang jigae (a tofu soup with vegetables), the BBQ squid, the Galbi (cooked tabletop), the marinated chicken (cooked table top), the duk boki (rice cakes in a sweet and spicy red pepper sauce), and the seafood bibimbop (a rice dish in a stone pot) were all tasty. The bibimbop was a little bit wetter (sorry if that's not a word) than it should be but everything else was great.We were all stuffed but decided it was fair to have dessert if we walked there. We headed down to Cafe Brama, a place Lon and I had gone to before with another group of friends. This time, there was a live band playing. We had a crepe with fruit and vanilla ice cream (which I loved last time) but the crepe wasn't as tender this time and there was way too much sauce this time which made it too sweet. Still good but not awesome.I also remembered them having one of the best capuccino's in town and by leaps and bounds, the best smoothies. 4 people had smoothies: strawberry, strawberry banana, pineapple, and blueberry. Everyone raved while exchanging glasses to try different flavors. To me, the blueberry was the winner and I'm thinking about walking over tonight to get another one. Seriously, you'll laugh at the idea that you ever drank Jamba Juice. ...and the cappuccino's still great too!It's really hard to find a cafe with really good products these days. With the super hospitable service, I can't figure out why they're not always packed. I'm planning on trying them for brunch too.

New NaimatKada
CONTENT
Maybe six months ago, Jessica and I went to watch some jazz over at Jazz Standard on 27th street with her family. Since we arrived a bit early we went for a walk around the area, a.k.a Curry Hill and stumbled upon a hole in the wall joint, with delicious aroma wafting into the street. We stopped in and for a dollar or two left with a delicious meatcicle-like item.Well recently, I've been consulting in that neighborhood again, and for lunch today, a friend and I wandered down Lexington and I re-discovered the hole in the wall, and found it's name to be New NaimatKada New NaimatKada. Abdul, the really nice guy up front / owner, helped us to the menu, and we both selected the Tandoori Lunch Special for $8.50. This gigantic meal includes a vast plate of standard Indian basmati rice, two large chunks of murg tandoor kebab (chicken pieces cooked in a tandoor on a skewer, then covered in a delicious yogurt-based sauce); an entire tandoori chicken leg; one of the kefta kebabs (ahem, the meatcicle); and a big ole nan.The food at this Pakistani joint, which only serves Halal food, is all pre-made, but provided hot and delicious. And well worth the price! We were both stuffed, and easily could have just shared one. But I'm a fat pig, so c'est la vie. - Lon

Cafe Centro
CONTENT
My new boss, Roger, took me to Cafe Centro for lunch today. He made reservations in the morning, but when we got there, it was packed and we had to wait for a while. I don't agree with restaurants taking reservations when they can't honor them. We weren't pressed for time in this case but.....The space is a bright open space with an open kitchen. Servers are dressed in uniform and the mass of business people fill the space very loudly. It is the scene you would imagine of a Grand Central Restaurant.I order the Lump Crab Cake appetizer, which Roger suggested, and it was a good crab cake. Barely any filler, but held together well enough, and cooked properly. What I really liked was the light horseradish paste shaped into a quenelle perched on top. My entree was Seared Sea Scallops with Truffle Whipped Potatoes. The scallops were cooked perfectly but the sauce was a bit too salty and overly buttery. None of the minor errors were enough to prevent me from cleaning the plates. Roger had the Field Greens Salad to start. I didn't taste it but the greens weren't cut into small enough pieces, which is a minor peeve of mine. I don't believe in eating salad with a knife or having to bite off pieces. As the main course, he ordered the Tuesday special - Branzino. The skin was nice and crisp but the fish was cooked just a tiny bit over. It still tasted good since it was fresh fish.The menu, portions, and sizes are really more like a dinner than a lunch so it's a definite treat mid- Monday. However, it's the type of place that's good but forgettable since the dishes aren't very inventive, but executed well enough to be the perfect spot for a business lunch.

I used to rave about FD's parbaked breads, especially the ciabatta sandwich rolls. They were so easy to store, heat up, and have that wonderful fresh out of the oven taste. BUT, our last order of the par-bakes were disappointing. The rolls were smaller and didn't taste the same. When following the heating instructions we had always used, the middle would still be frozen. I just checked and they increased the price too! Boo FreshDirect!

Fast Food: Ads vs. Reality
CONTENT
Using StumbleUpon, I came across a web page where someone took the time to compare the images of fast food products in marketing versus in real life, i.e. straight from the store. In this Ads vs. Reality comparison by Jeff Kay at the WVSR, it really shows how sad and gross fast food can be.Generally, I actually think the images of the real food were more impressive than I otherwise would have guessed they'd be. The two that were really sad though were the Arby's \"Beef 'n' Ceddar\" and the Burger King \"Whopper\".In my experience with fast food, they do an unusually sad job with sandwiches, for some reason the prep cooks always seem to want to crush them. Weird.p.s. This all reminds me of the time I got really excited for a huge breakfast sandwich Burger King was launching, some time ago. They kept advertising how huge it was. When I actually bought it it was smaller than a computer mouse, so I took a picture and emailed it around to friends. I can't seem to find that picture, but it was pathetic.

Laifood Reincarnate?
CONTENT
Good Taiwanese food is hard to find and Laifood had been a staple for my family for years. Sadly, it closed. Over the years, there was a couple of changes in ownership/managment while interest over the restaurant dwindled. Recently, my mom heard that the food was good again so we decided to give it a shot.It's now called Lau's Seafood in English but the Chinese name (Hai Dz Way) remains the same. The menu is almost exaclty the same too. The food did taste different than the original Laifood, some better, some worse, and some equal but different. The Oyster Pancake and the Basil Snails were amazing while the minced pork on rice and the fried squid fell short. The whole fish in bean sauce was very good and the Taiwanese version of mooshu pork came with impressively thin and tender crepes. The chicken roll, Taiwanese Mai Fun, and possibly some dishes that I am now forgetting were standard. It was Lon's first time eating Taiwanese food and my mom got carried away ordering. I was happy enough with this representation of Taiwanese food and Lon will happily eat Taiwanese food again.While not every dish at this restaurant is perfect, the prices certainly justify trying it, especially if you haven't had Taiwanese food before.

We love watching MythBusters, and particularly enjoy the food-related myths. I also try to do a bit of sleuthing myself when I receive various warning (cough: spam) forwards in email. So when I found Peter Aitken's Kitchen Myths page, I really enjoyed reading them and following some of the reference links. Most of his busts seem well backed up!And they're interesting and educational. My favorite was about the difference between thickening agents. It's good reference to keep around.

Finally, great pizza......Numero 28
CONTENT
I love pizza and New York has better pizza than Florida, California, New Jersey, etc. I eat at places like Patsy's, John's, Arturo's, and Nick's which have good pizza but not amazing pizza, like the one I had in Budapest. (I've haven't been to Italy yet...)There are so many dimensions on which I rate pizza: the cheese, the sauce, the dough, sometimes toppings, and the ratio of those 4 things to each other. It's important that each layer of the pizza is flavorful. Often the dough and crust leave that job entirely to the sauce, cheese, and toppings. Sometimes the sauce and/or cheese are just overly salty, and often toppings are in large pieces that you can't bite through easily. With one bite, you end up pulling off the piece of eggplant meant for 5 bites. Yet other frequent mistakes are too little sauce, the wrong amount of cheese, or more toppings than pizza. That's one of my biggest peeves: that toppings overwhelm the pizza, and so I end up just ordering plain most of the time.I'm happy to announce that I've finally found outstanding pizza in NY - Numero 28. Lon and I came across it accidentally while walking around on a beautiful day. We had low expectations and just wanted a place where we could sit outside since we had Ice (our Jack Russell) with us. We ordered a 14″ pie, half plain, half sausage. We both loved it! The tomato sauce was full of real tomato flavor. The crust was chewy yet crispy with flavor in the dough. Yes, I just said flavor in the dough! The proportion of cheese to sauce to crust was just right and it came out piping hot. Lon's sausage topping was very tasty and more importantly crumbled over the pizza as opposed to large, chewy chunks.The family who runs the place was very friendly. It looks like it's a husband and wife, a daughter (all with thick accents) and a teenage boy they hired and trained to man the oven. It's a very low maintenance scene with the intent to focus purely on the quality of their food. We overheard the boy telling someone else that the boss built the oven himself and that the family was certified in Naples as pizza makers (a 250-year family tradition). I believe it. Lon and I, big pizza critics, left thoroughly happy. We complimented the small staff wholeheartedly and they offered Lon some pictures by the oven.Good prices, friendly service, delicious pizza! Try it!

Born Too Late for Street Food
CONTENT
I love me some street food. I'm talking about corn dogs, sausage and peppers on hero bread, sweet corn arepas with melty cheese, gyros, etc. Every time I travel I try all the street food (I think I ate rat in Russia one time). The best street food I ever ate were the sweet roti in Thailand.The US, while not offering the best quality street food, definitely has a decent selection, although not as substantial as oriental night markets (like one of the ones I've visited, shown on the right). I've always enjoyed this kind of cheap, fast, crappy food. I remember when I was young my town had the Fiesta Italiana, the week following labor day. And I also remember being upset at how a simple sausage & peppers hero was $4.50! Whew that was expensive for a 12 year old. I remember thinking how that was too much money and I could go to any pizzeria for the same sandwich for $3 or $3.50.Well fast forward to now, and I'm thinking it's gotten even worse! Today we were walking through a street fair and the price of a gyro platter (rice, a bit of salad, and some gyro meat) was EIGHT dollars! Are they insane!? One block away from them, every day, is a phenomenal gyro stand (the NE corner of 14th Street and Broadway) where you can get the same platter with or without chicken (as a combo) for $4.00, half the price, and it tastes amazing. Sausage and peppers have gone up from the insane recent prices of between $6-$6.50 to the astounding $7.00. I almost fell over. The arepas are now $3 for a small and $4 for the normal size.No longer is any of this remotely worthwhile. The food is dirty and greasy, the taste is lacking, and there is no love. I'm thinking the sweet spot in terms of price-value-time was for people who were adults in the early eighties. While the prices were a bit more expensive than store prices, they were still affordable. Oh well.

Stuffed Cheesecake
CONTENT
Being a fan of all things cheesecake, I was excited by the cheesecake \"throwdown\" a few weeks ago and made an Apple Caramel Cheesecake inspired by Flay's entry. However, having a bit of cream cheese left over from the massive amount we purchased at Costco, I'm making a new cheesecake inspired by the competition, Junior's, and their entry the Devil's Food Cheesecake.Some may ask why on earth I didn't just travel over to Junior's, with two of their locations being within 20 minutes of my home, so let me answer: because I do not like Junior's cheesecake! I have tried their cakes on at least four occasions and am less than impressed. They taste bland, overly sweet, too dry, and generally a day old. So rather than go overpay for one of their crappy cakes, I made my own, and besides, I prefer vanilla over chocolate.This recipe basically requires three nine-inch cake pans on hand, I have two and a spring form, which works fine.I used a Basic Cheesecake Recipe:Cream cream cheese and sugar, then add sour cream, then one egg at a time, followed by lemon and vanilla. Scrape down sides, mix again and bake in a 9-inch cake pan (with NO CRUST) in a waterbath at 325 degrees F for 50-60 minutes- until center is jello-like and the outside is firm. Then let stand in over for another hour before chilling over night.And then prepared a basic Yellow Layer Cake recipe (from About.com):Sift flour, baking powder, and salt in a medium bowl set aside. Cream sugar and butter in a large bowl, until light and fluffy, then beat in one egg at a time. Mix in half the flour mixture followed by half of the milk. Add vanilla. Mix until blended; add remaining flour and milk and beat until smooth. Fill two greased and floured 9-inch cake pans. Bake at 375° for 25 to 35 minutes, until toothpick in center comes out clean.The next day, I whipped up some Butter Cream Icing (from Wilton):Cream butter and shortening with electric mixer. Add vanilla. Gradually add sugar, one cup at a time, beating well on medium speed. Scrape sides and bottom of bowl often throughout whole process! When all sugar has been mixed in, icing will appear dry. Add milk and beat at medium speed for several minutes until light and fluffy. This is enough icing to do a thin layer- perfect for us. If you want a heavier layer (i.e. crumb coat and top coat) you'll need to increase the icing recipe by 50% or 100%.Then it was time to Assemble the Cake:Enjoy. We did. See the rest of the pictures in the Flickr set.

Noodle Soups
CONTENT
Lon and I haven't been feeling that well for the past 2 days, and for me that means eating lots and lots of noodle soups. While nothing that delivers to me is like my mom's noodle soup or Chinatown quality (or price), there's a couple of places that are acceptable and then there are tons of terrible ones so I thought I'd fill everyone in on the noodle soup situation here. And, please feel free to recommend a place if you think I've missed it. I'll be very, very grateful if it's good.Express Manna KitchenI haven't tried any noodle soups from this place yet but their Dukk Boki is good so I'll have to try some more stuff some time... The problem is that they're more of a lunch place so they close pretty early.HamachiThis is actually a neighborhood Japanese restaurant but they have a good selection of udons, sobas, and yosenabes.Try: Spicy Seafood Miso (It's a noodle soup with a tremendous amount of seafood but it's not listed on the MenuPages menu for some reason.)Je 'BonTonight was our first try of this place and we were happy with our delivery. We ordered the Kichinabe (flavorful dumplings), the silver needles (subtle, but good flavors and textures), and the Wine Chicken. I was surprised by the authentic flavor which included goji berries and other medicinal flavors that most places outside of Chinatown don't dare to use. It's exactly what my mom always made me drink when I was sick, minus the broccoli (Chinese people don' t put that in soup) and the fact that they de-boned the chicken leg.L'annamYes, this is a Vietnamese place but sadly I won't eat the pho there. The stock just doesn't taste right. But there are a couple of noodle soups that will do for the price.Try: Duck Black Mushroom Noodle Soup, Saigon Style Noodle Soup (I don't like water chestnuts, but there's good soup flavor), Steamed Grandma Recipe Soup (perfect for when you're sick)Pilly'sThis is actually a deli but the second floor has a seating area where they serve good Korean soups at really good prices. Keep in mind that Korean food is only served until about 7:30 on weekdays and not served on weekends.Try: Duk Mandoo Gook, Kalbi Tang, Yookgae JangRepublicThis place is all scene and pays little attention towards the food. I've been dragged here a couple of times yet I can never remember anything I ate. Enough said?Saigon GrillDon't get the pho at this place either. The soup never comes hot enough and again doesn't taste right. They don't really have much else in terms of noodle soups.Soba YaSome of my friends love this place, but I think their stuff tastes pretty bland. I'm never a big fan of soba though...Sammy's Noodle ShopThe noodle soups are the only items you can eat from here. The rest tastes like average dirty Chinese take-out. I don' t like the wontons because they're not authentic (too doughy and over-sized) but Lon does. Generally the soup noodles have good flavors but occasionally the noodles are over-cooked.Try: Stewed Beef Noodle Soup (very concentrated), Pickled Cabbage and Shredded Pork Noodle Soup, Noodles with bean paste and miced meat sauce (not a soup noodle though)Tokyo LamenThis is one of the worst restaurants I've ever been to. I went with my cousin and my brother. All 3 of us ordered different soup noodles and none of them tasted any better than if you microwaved instant noodles or cooked one of those udon packs from an Asian market.Don't Try!Vanessa's DumplingsWe ordered from this place a couple of times. Sometimes it was great and sometimes food tasted old and I was offended by the flavor of shrimp going bad. We've stopped ordering from this place because of the inconsistency but if you want a noodle soup, the beef noodle soup was good the first few times.

The Best Restaurant in the World

For years I've wanted to eat at The Fat Duck, widely renowned as the best restaurant in the world. However, as of last year, and just repeated this year, El Bulli has surpassed FD for consideration as the number one.It is clear now that I must eat at both FD and El Bulli.

Birdbath by The City Bakery
CONTENT
On our way to dinner at Chanto, we discovered a new bakery called Birdbath. The owners of The City Bakery decided to put together a green bakery made with some recycled materials, some re-used, and energy conserving appliances. The walls are finished with milk paint and some products represent certain causes. I sampled their \"Two-tone\", a blend of iced coffee and iced chocolate. It was delicious so I made a plan to come back after dinner.After our 7-course meal, I was too stuffed to eat any more food so we bought breakfast for the morning. We tried the bear claw which is a claw shaped puff pastry with a stewed apricot filling. A percentage of the $4 will go to saving polar bears. That was my favorite. The ginger scone was too strong for both of us so we didn't finish it. The 2 giant cookies were both too sweet for me but Lon liked both the chocolate chip and the oatmeal raisin cookie.I was kind of dissappointed since I was hoping to really like this place but ended up not impressed. I'll still be going to the original City Bakery for their amazing pretzel croissants!

What Time is Dinner?
CONTENT
While reading Reddit this morning, one of my favorite social link sharing sites, I clicked in to a History Magazine article on the history of dinner, and more specifically what time we eat it. It's more than a quick read, but includes many interesting points, such as correlating later meals with the advent of artificial light (better candles and then electricity). That seems like common sense, but most of us wouldn't have realized it. Another interesting point is the timing of meals based on the timing of our jobs.

Chanto
CONTENT
Have you ever had a perfect dining experience? As food connoisseurs we live for stellar service, delectable dishes, and architectural astonishment and as bloggers for alliteration obviously. At Chanto, an upscale Japanese restaurant in the West Village, we found what we were looking for. A friend, whose taste in Japanese food is more than trustable (she's a \"taste bud\" for us, and also provided the pictures on this post) recommended we go. She had read in a Japanese newspaper that Chanto was offering a discount on its tasting menu to celebrate their one year anniversary: a great idea from this massive, global restaurant company. When we arrived we all ordered the seven course version (actually they require that everyone at the table have it if person wants it), not that the regular menu wasn't enticing.We planned on dining with three other guests, but when we arrived no one else was there. Jessica and I sat in the open-air, front window and people watched the southern seventh avenue folk as we sipped the house drink called \"Chantotini\", a delicious, semi-sweet, lime-accented vodka drink. We wondered why more people weren't packed in by 7pm, the time we got there, noticing only a small crowd at the other window. A few minutes after 7 Sara showed up and we found out our two other guests were not going to make it. The hall manager was flexible and arranged a great table for the three of us.Before talking about the food, let's just quickly cover the style. Downstairs is a stylish bar, with stairs rising into a small dining area. The dark black walls make the environment look cozy. But as the manager guided us to our table, we rose along a dark stairwell, with animated flames projected along the wall, into a new area that is not visible from downstairs. There were 12-foot ceilings, with floor-to-ceiling windows, huge chandeliers, and jazz playing low in the background. We all commented on the style as staff helped us to our seats and covered our laps with napkins.While browsing the menu, Sara ordered a drink, and we received a free salad: hand shaved baby carrot, baby beet, baby zucchini, celery, and a simple dressing of olive oil, miso, and anchovies. The overly hard beets were not as young as they appeared, but it was clear that attention and energy had been spent in the carving, and the rest of the salad was great. During the salad we ordered the tasting menu and waited for Sara's drink; the waiter's only question was how we wanted our meat course prepared. was the only bump in otherwise great service. We had to re-request her drink twice before it was delivered. It was tasty though, I believe it was a passion fruit cocktail.The first course arrived, three plank-cuts of fatty tuna, served carpaccio style with watercress and soy sauce. The three of us moaned in synchronicity and savored those omega-3s. With excellent timing our plates were cleared and the second course, tebagyo was delivered. This was what Jessica had been waiting for: a chicken wing heartily stuffed with pork dumpling filling. It was very lightly glazed with teriyaki sauce, that added a bit of sweetness. I found this course more of an experiment in stuffing than in taste. It was a bit bland but presented beautifully and executed well.Course after course was timed perfectly. As one course was cleared, the silverware was set for the next, then a few minutes later the course would arrive, along with an explanation of what we were about to enjoy.The third course arrived, a black cod that was absolutely perfectly cooked. Seared to perfection on the top and bottom, and exactly medium rare in the center. The sake kasu sauce was remarkably rich for a fish sauce, but didn't go too far. Actually, the sauce was a perfect match for the two spears of asparagus (one white, one green) that accompanied the fish, as well as for the microgreens. And the greens had the right taste to match the fish. It was a well assembled course that was cooked to perfection. Both Jessica and Sara thought the fish tasted like Chilean Sea Bass and it turns out that Black Cod is actually a frequent stand-in for Chilean Sea Bass (a.k.a. \"toothfish\") and can be caught in the same waters.Because of the rich sauce, I was really glad to find the fourth course to be a palette cleanser: Yuzu Sorbet. However the sorbet was really more of a sherbet and the portion was more of a dessert than a cleanser. We all savored it though.We moved on to the fifth course and Sara was getting full, but my mouth was watering as the perfectly cooked sirloin (to our earlier requests of doneness) arrived, pre-sliced with a selection of eating accoutrement including two types of spicy mustard (wasabi and something else I don't recall), soy sauce, crispy garlic, sea salt (or perhaps it was grey), and awesome potatoes. I had a fun time trying different combinations of the bites on the plate and craved more.But even I was starting to feel full after the sixth course: omakase sushi. We enjoyed three pieces of blue fin tuna maki (sadly one of my pieces had split open), and three pieces of nigiri: fatty tuna, blue fin tuna, and fluke. The ginger was remarkably strong and the wasabi quite weak, especially swimming in the vast amount of soy poured for each of us.The final course, dessert, was a common combination of chocolate cake and green tea ice cream. However, again, it comes down to execution and Chanto pulled off this combo better than any other I had ever experienced. For some reason, they called the cake a \"fondant\" on the menu and \"flan\" when it was announced table-side, but it was neither. It was a soufflé with a molten center and it was chocolate sensation pairing perfectly with the matcha green tea ice cream. The sugared alm onds were also enjoyable in the dessert plate, but didn't add much.Overall, the seven-course menu food was fantastic and the service sensational. It is a great value at the regular price of $80 and a steal at the anniversary price of $55. You need to go to Chanto.

Grand Central Market and O & Co.
CONTENT
Grand Central Terminal in New York City is a phenomenal place to visit for many reasons. I always recommend that tourists try to stop by and stand in the main entrance way for a few minutes around 8:45am on a weekday. There is nothing like feeling 2 million people pass by you in a matter of an hour. As things slow down you can wander around and enjoy the massive space, beautiful light, remarkable architecture, and linger in the long history. However, if you're New Yorkers (prounced \"Nu Yawcuz\") you probably breeze through and skip all that.If you're savvy though, like us, you'll stop every now and then and smell the roses, or in our case, the food. There are lots of great shops in GCT, and amazingly, they're prices aren't that bad! We stopped by the Super Runners' Shop after a swing dance class hosted by Dr. Jerry Feldman. But the market called out to me, so we wandered in that direction.Afterwards we strolled through the market, I wanted to stop by Penzey's, but before we got there I found myself at the Koglin counter. I swear that counter gets me every time! We picked up four links of Weisswurst and two of breakfast sausage that looked interesting. I'll find out about the breakfast sausage tomorrow morning... for breakfast. But the other will make its way into our dinner tomorrow night, along with a chicken that is now defrosting.Penzey's, our next stop, is the best spice shop (and catalog) I know of. The counter staff are consistently knowledgeable and friendly. Today, I wanted to pick up a dehydrated cheese powder to top my next batch of potato chips, last night's chips were so good! Unsurprisingly they had four different types and let us sample them all. We chose the \"Brady Street Cheese Sprinkle\" and walked away with a big smile.

A Cherry Balsamic, she gave me with Chili oil-WOW! and a Fig Balsamic with a PUNCH! I love them all! They also just got the new harvest and the Disisa from Sicily is amazing!ENJOY!

Anon, thank you for letting us know! We will definitely go check those out, they sound wonderful- particularly the Fig Balsamic. Did you see the recent post where we mentioned the tomato balsamic we bought? We'll probably post a more complete write up on that soon.Generally, I avoid herb-infused oils & vinegars; I just feel I don't need the added flavor of herbs, since I can add them fresh later and achieve almost the same effect, particularly since I rarely give a final dressing of just oil or just vinegar.  However, the mint sounds interesting, especially since I rarely have mint on hand.Thanks again!

FreshDirect, Mussels, and Potato Chips
CONTENT
Last night we enjoyed mussels, bread, red wine, and an after dinner snack of home made potato chips.While in the past, I've mentioned (and so has Jessica) how frustrating FreshDirect can be, I've also said that I would continue using them just due to convenience. Our recent order was yet another example of what can go wrong. There were minor issues like receiving the smallest parsnips either of us had ever seen; while more impactful was the taste of the mussels.Jessica ordered two pounds of mussels, which were great in that few (if any) were dead, but they had almost zero taste and were not cheap- as opposed to the mussels we picked up in Chinatown. We didn't realize that until tasting the dish- how could we? Anyway, I went for an Asian taste prepared in a traditional French manner.MusselsI am not formatting this recipe as I didn't measure and am documenting by memory. I sautéed about half a cup of diced yellow onion in two tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil in a large stock pot over medium heat. Once soft, I added 1/2 tsp. of red pepper flakes and a pinch of kosher salt. After letting the red pepper infuse the onions and oil for about 30 seconds, I added three cloves of sliced garlic and a knob of diced ginger (about 1 tbsp.).About 30 seconds later I stirred in 2 tbsp. of tomato paste, which carmelized for two minutes, before I deglazed with a wonderful Chilean Cabernet Sauvignon (Vino de Eyzaguirre), which later accompanied our dinner. Once saucey (that's a technical term), I added the two pounds of mussels, 2 tbsp. chiffonaded cilantro, and a 16oz can of diced tomatoes (from my emergency kit). And covered.We enjoyed the mussels with a par-baked bread from FreshDirect, a salad with an asian dressing recipe Jessica found online, and the red wine.But then after dinner, nicely buzzed (read: drunk) from 2.5 glasses of that wine (hey! don't make fun of my tolerance, or lack thereof), I got a craving for potato chips. Fortunately we have a sack of potatoes laying around- who doesn't?Potato ChipsI peeled (with my trusty Oxo peeler) about eight medium and small russet potatoes and floated them in a large, stainless steel bowl of acidulated water. Then I set my mandoline to the absolute thinnest setting I could attain and got to slicing potatoes. After each potato I placed the slices back into the water, making sure they were separate.At the same time I heated vegetable oil to 375 degrees in a relatively narrow sauce pan (six inches maybe) to use less oil but maintain depth in the liquid. And I set up a drying rack over a baking sheet in the oven, set to 300 degrees F.Once I finished slicing potatoes, I grabbed a handful at a time and dried them in a salad spinner. Before dropping them into the hot oil. Using a spider, I gently tossed the potatoes in the oil to prevent them sticking together. After about three minutes, I removed the potatoes in a bowl with a few paper towels in the bottom. After starting another batch of potatoes in the fryer, I seasoned those in the bowl using a mixture of salt, garlic powder, cayenne, black pepper, and parsley. Once seasoned I placed the cooked chips onto the rack in the oven.I repeated that process until all chips were done, and I left them in the oven for about ten more minutes, before Jessica and I couldn't take it any longer and ravaged them.

Yolato
CONTENT
It's finally nice out! Lon and I took Ice, our Jack Russell, for a stroll down to the Village to try that new place Yolato. Their concept is a frozen yogurt based gelato, offering the health benefits of yogurt and the taste of gelato. Well, I have to say that I'm pretty disappointed!First of all, I think it's decieving that they have a case of different flavors of gelato on display as the most prominent item. I went in assuming that was the yolato. Right before ordering, I decided to double check...all of these are yolato? The girl replies \"no, they're all gelato\" and points to a soft serve machine behind her. That is the yolato. So I ask what flavor does that come in? \"Only plain.\" OK, since I came to try yolato, I might as well try it so I ordered one for myself and the birthday cake flavored gelato for Lon (which he thought was below average).Here's my second complaint: It does not taste anything like gelato. The most accurate way to describe it would be a yogurt flavored icy because it's not creamy. Lon hated it and I liked it enough to eat it, but probably won't go to buy it again.

Kampuchea Noodle Bar, Cake Shop, and Organic Avenue
CONTENT
Lon and I planned a double date with Sheryl and Wymen. First stop, Kampuchea Noodle Bar. According to a couple of different press pieces, it's the first and only Cambodian restaurant in NYC. I'm not an expert on Cambodian food but it seemed a lot more fusion to me. The food is good but not outstanding so I left feeling like I paid too much. I was also disappointed in how few noodle selections there were for a noodle bar (Click here to link to a menu).So, we shared 3 starters: the skirt steak (grill section), Tiger Shrimp Savory Crepe, and the Crispy Skin Pork (share plates). The skirt steak was cooked perfectly and served with nicely pickled vegetables. The shrimp crepes looked like a great concept but lacked flavor. The pork came in a really small portion (1 bite for each person) and was not crispy as the name suggests. We each ordered a noodle-based entree: Sheryl had the chicken katiev. Wymen had the duck katiev. Lon had the prawn katiev; and I had the chilled rice vermicelli. All were good but nothing special. Overall, the flavors were disappointingly conservative. The service was a bit below average and the backless wooden stools were uncomfortable, and left us wondering where we should put our coats.In the end, I'm not mad that I went to Kampuchea but I'm not recommending it. It's only a few blocks from Congee Village so I recommend going there when you're in the area.After dinner, we looked for a dessert spot (Lon found on Vindigo) and ended up at Cake Shop. It's a really crappy looking place, but their Vegan Peanut Butter Bomb (recommended by the girl behind the counter) was really good. Lon found his second love and dared to compare it to the peanut butter cream I had made a few weeks ago.After eating the enormous piece of bomb, we wondered in to a place called Organic Avenue (101 Stanton St.) and met Doug, the owner, who really knew his products well. He answered every question; Lon asked about at least 20 different products from Maca to Mulberries. The store had clothing, bamboo dishware, and ofcourse food products. We bought some wild mulberries and will probably go back again. They really have some interesting items that you won't even find at Whole Foods.What a great night! Dinner, dessert, and a lesson on some lesser known organic products. That's my idea of fun.

As usual, my opinions are more extreme than others- and this swings both good and bad.  In the case of Kampuchea, I want to extend Jess' comment by noting that I was really unhappy with the price and the food.  I want my food authentic-which in this case should have meant pungent and spicy and for food of that nature, it should be cheap.  For instance, a similar sandwich at any Vietnamese sandwich shop (which are at most 10 blocks away) would cost $3, here they are $10.  A bowl of soup like this on University is $9 instead of $17.  Further, if I'm going to pay double or even triple, I definitely do not want to be stuffed in like a sardine.  Kampuchea gets two major thumbs down from me.On the other hand, Cake Shop, a little hole in the wall, had plenty of seating for a Thursday late evening crowd in the L.E.S. including counter service -- I love that.  The girl behind the counter was extremely helpful and friendly, and as Jessica mentioned, she referred me to the Peanut Butter Bomb which was absolutely sensational.  I HIGHLY recommend getting it.  For $5 you will be chocolate and peanut butter-ed out.  Jessica also said their coffee was above par.  This hole in the wall gets two thumbs up.

In NYC it's often hard to say what will succeed.  They are on a main avenue which helps, and they've gotten great press, and their owner comes from a solid background.  Unfortunately, good service and good food are not the main factors about what will work.  Usually for places like Kampuchea it's about brand and price.If I was a betting man, I'd guess Kampuchea will not make it.

Jamaican Beef Patties
CONTENT
Jamaican Beef Patties have less ingredients than I thought -- all things you would likely have in a normal pantry. This recipe yields a yummy curry-flavored patty that has a beautiful golden color. The dough is tender, flaky, and flavorful and I definitely recommend trying it. However, I do have some notes for you.The dough was very hard to work with so I would suggest chilling the dough before rolling it out and filling it (much like pie dough). Also, the recipe does not give instructions for what to bake it on and how to prepare the baking pan. I used a flat cookie sheet and put wax paper (or parchment) on top. Be very careful removing the patties when they are hot because the dough will break but taste very good. It's also great to have leftovers. They reheat in the oven and taste just as good.For more images of this great dinner, have a peek at the Jamaican Dinner set in Flickr.

Accidentally Healthy Yummy Soup
CONTENT
This weather is ridiculous for mid-April. I still find myself avoiding errands and missing several gym classes. Instead of the usual spring salads and sidewalk cafe lunches, I'm sitting at home thinking about soup and since it's raining, I'm not willing to go buy any ingredients.Regretfully, I did not write anything down while I was making this soup since I was just throwing stuff from my fridge in, but it came out tasting very good, looking very attractive (due to the bright purples, reds, and oranges), and actually being very healthy.This is an estimated recipe:Place first 5 ingredients in a 3 1/2 Quart pot. Cook on high until it boils. Add red cabbage and simmer for 10 minutes. Add the canned diced tomato and water (if needed). Sprinkle with dried oregano and black pepper and simmer for another 15 minutes. Simple huh?While I was drinking the soup, I marveled at how pretty it was and how full of vitamins and antioxidants it is (beta-carotene, Vitamin A, lycopene, and more). If you're interested in the specific health benefits of the major ingredients, here are some links:

Left-Overs: Chicken Wings & Potato Balls
CONTENT
We do not like wasting food, but unlike me, Jessica is not crazy about eating left-overs. Personally, I could sit and eat left-overs hot or cold all day long. In a compromise we try to convert most left overs into new dishes and we have lots of fun doing it! It's a bit like \"Iron Chef\": we open our fridge and try to clean out as much as we can into dishes.Last night we were pretty full from our lunch at Downtown Atlantic, so we didn't want a huge dinner. I opened the fridge and found left-over scallion mashed potatoes, half of a sad-looking lime, chicken wings from two chickens I had butchered recently for grilled chicken, and red pepper hummus that Jessica had made a few weeks ago.I set out two flat bowls (something these bowls): in one I whisked a large egg and in the other I combined Italian bread crumbs, garlic, cayenne pepper, curry powder, dried parsley, table salt, and black pepper. I then rolled the mashed potatoes into balls in my hands, ran them through the egg, and then coated them in the bread crumbs. These were placed onto a Pam-sprayed baking sheet (we use the Airbake sheets, they're great) and baked at 400 degrees F for about 30 minutes.Then I took out the wings, and coated them with a bit of flour and baking powder- this really dries their surface perfectly in order to get a better breading. Then they went through the egg and into the breading. In the mean time I headed some vegetable oil in a wok. Going with the evening's theme, I had some reserved vegetable oil used twice previously for making other fried goodies. They cooked for about five minutes and then I continued cooking them in the oven for ten minutes.When the potato balls were done, I topped them with lime juice, and plated with the chilled red pepper hummus. It was a perfect dressing and the plate looked great. We ate the potato and chicken along with a delicious salad that Jessica whipped up in no time. It ended up being a bit more food than we had planned for, but it was wonderful and consumed our left overs.See more pictures in the Flickr photoset.

Downtown Atlantic
CONTENT
Lon and I made a lunch date with Sal and Rochelle, who recommended Downtown Atlantic, a place Rochelle (the cupcake expert) often buys cupcakes at. The place is set up like a restaurant except that the very front looks like a little bake shop. The cupcakes in the window definitely called to me as I walked in and I tried hard to focus on lunch first.After being seated, a basket of moist carrot or zucchini cake (some kind of quick bread but not sure which one because it didn't have a distinct flavor) is placed on your table with some butter. It's a nice treat while you read through the abundant choices.Appetizers:Lon and I shared the Grilled Octopus Salad which was delicious. The octopus was cooked perfectly and the radicchio was a perfect match for the light dressing. Sal had the Crispy Polenta with wild mushrooms and Rochelle ordered the Crispy \"Mahjong\" Spring Rolls. They looked like spring rolls that were fatter than usual and the flavor wasn't like the normal spring roll. The shrimp were whole and cooked nicely, served fresh and hot. The portions were large for appetizers with a clean presentation.Entrees:Lon had the Tres Carnes Bucatini al Ragu, a hollow spaghetti with ragu made of lamb, beef, and pork. I thought the pasta was a bit over-cooked but the sauce was great! Rochelle ordered the Crispy Roasted Pork Shank which was enormous and came with french fries. I did try the french fries and they were good. Sal and I both ordered the Spinach Tagliatelle (tossed with shrimp, shitake mushrooms, and white truffle oil) which was a bit over salted but the shrimp were cooked perfectly.Dessert:We made a trip up front to drool at the dessert case filled with delicious looking cupcakes, tarts, and cakes. It was a hard decision and Lon left it up to me. I wanted the red velvet cupcake but I'm allergic to food coloring so I chose the chocolate banana cream tart. Sal and Rochelle shared a chocolate cupcake filled with white cream like those hostess cupcakes, but bigger. Rochelle and I thought the desserts were great but Lon and Sal were less impressed. I do agree with Lon that our tart needed more banana but I still thought it was yummy.Overall, we enjoyed the restaurant and it was worth the trip to Brooklyn. I would recommend going for dinner instead of lunch since the portions are pretty big and it's a place where you should really get an appetizer, entree, and dessert.Lon got a bit carried away with his picture phone during the meal- the results are shown to the right...

Mango Cut Flowers
CONTENT
Ok, I know that flowers are not food, usually, but this is related. An important part of serving food is decorating your table, and cut flowers are an easy and beautiful way to get the decor going. So, it made sense for us to include an entry on decorating.I was at Michael's on Passover with Jessica and Mom and found some great craft supplies for decorating cut flowers. I got a little carried away... buying a glass vase, river rocks, oasis, and moss.I set some soaked oasis in the center of my vase. It would have been much better to use cylindrically-shaped foam, but they only had bricks, so I had to shave it down. The foam was then surrounded it by the \"moss river rocks\", which are just greenish-hued, polished rocks. Then I cut and set in the bright yellow, gerbera daisies. My goal was to get the tops to complete fill the exact top of the vase and be perfectly level. That turned out to be much harder than I thought. As I put in each one, the next got harder and hard to place without crushing the prior. The result is semi-decent, but certainly not perfectly level.After setting the gerbera, I used chopsticks to place the reindeer moss below it. That added a lovely foresty scent and hide the oasis. My goal was to have tiers of experience. The bottom being focused on the ground with perfumed moss and rocks. Then nothing but thick stems flowing up to the daisies. Finally, the dainty rose stems flowing all the way up to the mini-roses. I really like the way the stems look from the side (see the pic to the right).The roses are the small size (about 1″ blooms) with very firm stems, to hold them in place. They are variegated peach and yellow color. The overall effect of the roses and daisies come out in a mango-colored theme.This looks great on any counter or table setting.For more pictures of this decoration, check out the Flickr set.

Apple and Maple Caramel Cheesecake
CONTENT
After watching the cheesecake episode Bobby Flay's \"Throwdown\" (not that I like Flay, I don't), I decided to make another of my many cheesecakes. Unlike Flay's cake with apple slices on top, I wanted a recipe that had apples in the cake, because most of the cheesecake I've made are smooth inside. Even my cookie dough cheesecake (I'll have to post that here eventually) is pretty smooth inside.After reviewing many recipes online, I decided that Brett Moore's recipe on About.com sounded the most interesting. However, it definitely needed some work... I'll tell you about some of my changes here.1. Moore's recipe doesn't specify what type of apple, Jessica chose Granny Smith for their great ability to stand up to cooking and their tartness and flavor.2. The recipe lists 1/2-inch cored slices, that implies full round, we went with halves as it makes far more sense for a cheesecake filling.3. Moore suggests Calvados or regular brandy, we went with regular brandy.4. The recipe calls for shortbread cookies in the crust. I used Keebler Cinnamon-flavored graham crackers to match flavor. They worked out wonderfully!5. The recipe forgets (I feel) to instruct toasting the pecans. That's important to bring out the flavor.6. We were out of light corn syrup and so I went with dark. Flavor-wise, I think this is a better choice, but I had a hard time telling how far along the caramel was since the recipe only says until \"golden amber color\" -- I unfortunately timed it slightly too short. I probably cooked the caramel about 10 minutes, but it should've gone about 15 to get to full darkness- honestly, I forgot how much lighter it would get after adding the heavy cream.7. The recipe recommends using a 10-inch springform pan, I used a regular cake round. I knew that with the eggs and apple this cake would have no problem flipping out of the pan.8. Moore instructs to cook for 75 minutes and then cool for 30 minutes before chilling. That sounded very long, I cooked for 60 minutes, but it actually was done at 50 (I should have stopped it but gave the benefit of the doubt, oops). Then I let rest in the oven for 45 minutes with the oven off and door partially open (this is the right technique). Then I let cool for 30 minutes before chilling over night.Overall, this recipe got two thumbs up from everyone who tasted it, all eight of us agreed.If you'd like to see more picture of the cooking process, have a look at our Flickr set.

Sripraphai

You can't really claim to have eaten at a Thai restaurant in NY unless you've eaten at Sripraphai. I don't know what type of food to call the rest but it's not Thai. And, how did they all end up with the same menu anyway?Sripraphai has delicious food. It's my second time back and I'm willing to leave Manhattan for it. Our table of 3 (Lon, Steve, and I), shared a Thai salad with peanut sauce, the green mango salad with chicken, squid, and shrimp (spicy and flavorful), the soft shell crab with papaya salad, the catfish with Thai eggplant, and the noodles with chicken and squid. The green mango salad was my favorite but everything was so good! You can't even find these dishes at the Thai places all over manhattan. And, you can't get this level of spice either.Their prices have gone up a bit but there's still so much on that menu well worth coming back to try. I've never disliked a dish their yet!

You bloggers in NYC are so lucky- there is so much to choose from and ethnic food everywhere(I guss the downside that there is lots of opportunity for bad food, too!) In the Tidewater area you have to do a lot of searching to find good ethnic food that is not Americanized. We are left to just make our own. Thanks for your glimpse of life in the big city!

Pizza
CONTENT
Pizza is high on the list of my favorite foods -- as they say, bad pizza is still good food. While I do enjoy going out to various pizzerias to sample their fare, I also enjoy making it. So I got excited when i read that food chemists are studying properties of whole-grain wheat to find cooking methods that will produce healthier food products. They used pizza as a sample.In the mean time, I'll stick with the dough recipes I generally use for making pizza. The most common recipe I use is called Jay's Signature Pizza Crust, posted on AllRecipes by SunFlower. This recipe works perfectly for New York style pizza crust and for rolls (chicken, sausage, eggplant, etc.). It's a fast, simple recipe.Recently, Jessica discovered Crazy Crust Pizza Dough on AllRecipes, posted by MBSolomon. This dough is more difficult to make and work with, but is ready for actual cooking faster than Jay's. The resulting crust rises substantially in the middle and offers a taste and texture quite similar to Pizza Hut's dough, though not identical (the right sauce helps).Here's a few ideas for how to top your homemade pizza:As Lidia says, tutti a tavola a mangiare!

When it comes to making red sauces, one can never be too prepared... except in my case. What you see to the right is my handy plastic crate completely brimming with cans of diced tomatoes, stewed tomatoes, tomato sauce, and tomato paste.As you can see I'm not exactly brand loyal when it comes to tomato products. I've got Hunts, Del Monte, and Contadina, just from what's visible. I basically buy whatever Costco or BJs is selling when I'm there, or whatever is cheapest at the supermarket.When I'm shopping for basic ingredients like tomato products, I'm really focusing on finding any product that is simple- I don't like the ones that add lots of sodium and preservatives and I NEVER buy the ones that have extra seasonings and flavors, like the ever-more common basil-infused tomato or the garlic & tomato paste.When you've only got a limited amount of cabinet space you need to focus on stocking simpler ingredients, and combining as needed. Or you could get a lavendar crate and put your tomato products in the living room.

Enchiladas!  Ay ya!
CONTENT
Yesterday we started defrosting some hamburger patties that I had formed from the 400 pound pile of ground beef sold by Costco. However, today I wasn't feeling hamburgers, and Jessica asked me to use up the Erivan Acidophilus Yogurt I had purchased from Garden of Eden. As an interesting aside, it was the cheapest one they sold and is a great plain, wet yogurt! Others agree.I used AllRecipes.com's ingredient search and found an enchilada recipe by Vanessa Robbins that had 4.5 stars. The recipe had a few problems for me. First it was too big, second it called for taco seasoning mix (I generally don't keep seasoning mixes around), third it called for condensed cream of chicken soup (another ingredient I don't stock). So, as usual I adjusted the recipe. I scaled it by a third using AllRecipe's recipe scaling tool, than adjusted manually so it made sense. Finally I reworked the missing ingredients based on common equivalents. So here you can compare the final recipe that we used for dinner versus the original.For more pictures of the enchilada making process, checkout the enchilada Flickr set.IngredientsMake light roux of butter & flour. Whisk in stock, whisk in milk, and bring to high heat until thick. Season well, cool.Directions

Buddha Bodai
CONTENT
I just had lunch with my friend Emily at Buddha Bodai, a vegetarian place on Mott, near Worth. They have a selection of lunch specials for $6.75 and a long list of dim sum items from $2-$3.95 per plate. We chose to split a General Tso's Vegetarian Chicken (with brown rice and a spring roll) and 3 dim sum plates.The General Tso's Veggie Chicken was actually great, to my surprise. Some people had raved about it on menupages but I rarely like fake meats. It was even better than regular General Tso's because it wasn't as oily and I didn't feel sick after eating it. The sticky rice wrapped in lotus leaves was good but I would've liked more filling. The steamed dumplings had a great dough but the filling was a bit too mushy. The Buddha Bean Curd was really good.With tax and tip, it was $19.55 and us two little piggies didn't quite finish the large lunch portions. The service was ehh.......well Chinatown style. The food was definitely good enough for the price points so I'd go back.

Gastroporn
CONTENT
While researching for the previous post on celebrity chefs, I read many articles about chefs and food networks. One of the articles I came across is a protracted piece from October 2005, by Frederick Kaufman of Harper's Magazine, entitled \"Debbie Does Salad: The Food Network at the Frontiers of Pornography\". In it Kaufman, via Barbara Nitke's insights, draws comparison between the shooting (sorry for the pun) of food television and porn, and writes:Do people really watch food television wishing they could replicate what they're seeing, and think they couldn't do it themselves? Probably... But that is not enough though to draw a conclusion between food shows and porn flicks. The entire article isn't only focused on this one point, however this one point symbolizes the flaws that Kaufman documents and Nitke states.Let's examine it closer. First, if the only requirement to be like porn was watching something you want to do but don't think you could, than just about everything on television and in movies would be porn for the average person. Is football porn? How about a Coke commercial? Is being interviewed by Charlie Rose porn? I recommend reviewing the definition of porn. Clearly Nitke and Kaufman think that watching something that you want to do and thinking you can't is porn. But perhaps their point is more about the likelihood of doing it or being able to do it?That's my second argument against their comparison. Maybe they're drawing the comparison on the basis of likelihood of the scenario coming to fruition? The chance that the pizza guy is going to stumble in on two bi-sexual beauties in lingerie that want to jump him... in real life.. is incredibly low. The likelihood that someone could go into their kitchen and make a great meal is... in real life.. extremely high. Just because you choose not to do something doesn't make it unlikely.Anyway, I don't want to meander too far off the topic of food. That's what this blog is all about. However, I think that generally food shows are doing a great job of marketing, and we should keep in mind that beautiful food imagery is not porn. Now on that topic, go enjoy one of my favorite Flickr groups: Foodgasm.

Review of Celebrity Chefs
CONTENT
Stephen noticed an article about Ina Garten, a.k.a. the Barefoot Contessa, and sent it to Kasi, who forwarded it on to me. The article was in The New York Times on Sunday and went on for four (online) pages about her recent background and what she's up to these days.When I watch Food Network or WLIW's cooking shows, as I so often do, I seriously consider why I'm listening to these celebrity chefs speak. What's their background? What do they do when they're not hosting a show? Are they creative? And are they talented chefs? If I'm going to spend time each week with a chef (watching their show), I sure hope they've got something to offer. That's why Food Network's recent run of Chefography Week is such a great idea and so is Garten's article (written by Micheline Maynard).So in my glorious arrogance, I will give a run down of the various celebrity chefs I watch out for (in a good or bad way) and why. I would love to hear your comments back on what you think of these chefs.I know I didn't cover every show and chef, some specific shows I left out are America's Test Kitchen, Barbecue University, Everyday Food, and Cucina Sicilia. But I really tried to focus on current cooking shows that have a single chef as host. If I left someone out, please let me know. And again, I'd love to hear others weigh in on these chefs. One page where lots of people weigh on chefs, though mostly Food Network, is in the Chowhound forums.

I have to agree with the Paula Deen comment...  But... have you see the episodes on Public Television with Jaque Pepin and Julia Child... It is call Jacque and Julia...  Just love them....  he is wonderful with her...led me to read his Memoirs, and they are wonderful....Great synopsis... I do like to watch Ina, even though she isn't a chef, either am I and that is why I like her...  At least she isn't Sandra Lee...I do get tired (or jealous) of hearing about her lunches with the ladies, or how she misses her husband as she stays home and entertains, in her gorgeous home, and drives her Mercedes...  She was a book keeper in the White House...  not a chef.. but boy I would trade places with her for a week!!!

I agree with you on Lidia, of course. But I'm surprised you like Paula Deen- whose cooking isn't particularly interesting- and  yetyou don't care for Bittman, whose "How To Cook Everything" is my go-to cookbook when I need a recipe for a dish I haven't cooked before. I've done a lot of the recipes he demonstrates on his show, and they've all been winners. Most of my friends who actually cook (as opposed to the food show junkies) have this book at the front of their cookbook shelf. On the other hand, I can't stand to watch Esposito, who can't let her guests get a word in edgewise and is constantly pushing them to agree with her. "That's right, isn't it??" But a chacon son gout.

Michael, I'm not a fan of Paula Deen anymore, now that her shows are all about just ridiculous deep fried and buttered stuff, and how she wants to molest all the male guests on her show.I do agree with Lon on Bittman though. I think people use his book because it's accessible, meaning, it uses ingredients and techniques that are easy for home cooks, which there is value in. It's kinda like Sandra Lee, mass market, but not as atrocious.At Foodmayhem, we're all about awesomeness. We want more than just apple pie and meatloaf (although we want some of that too). He's just mediocre, not awesome.

15 East
CONTENT
For lunch today, Steve, Justin, and I headed over to the relatively new Japanese joint, 15 East. My best guess is it's named after its address of 15 East 15th Street, but I'm not sure, I'll have to research it. It opened in the space where Tocqueville was. Toqueville moved down the street and got a bigger space, and we got a great Japanese restaurant.Executive Chef Marco Moreira, who opened Tocqueville after training at Bouley Bakery, added Japanese to his repertoire and brought in Masato Shimizu, who previously cooked at Jewel Bako. The space is a simple white and gray, broken into two rooms. The first room is a sushi bar featuring African bubinga wood. The second room, a smallish dining room, offers nice acoustics and comfortable chairs.The menu is simple offering Japanese appetizers & entrees in one section and sushi & sashimi in a second. Lunch had a fixed price, five-course lunch for $75 and a three-course for $27. All three of us opted for the latter. It started with a clear broth soup, then followed with kakiage (a tempura sampler), and finished with a chirashi.The broth, while clear, had a strong flavor, slightly salted from the seaweed. Unfortunately the saltiness did not infuse in the fishball (which reminded me of gefilte fish, Passover coming soon and all). It also included one beautifully cut piece of bamboo, but bamboo doesn't do much for me- to fibrous.The kakiage includes tempura-fried shrimp, Japanese eggplant, lotus root, and a latke made of root vegetables and sweet onions and is accompanied by a lime wedge and three salts: curry salt, green tea salt, and togarashi salt. The tempura was oily -- which it should never be -- but otherwise crispy and hot. The lime was not strong enough against the oil and likely the classic ginger and daikon would've been better at cutting the oil. The salts were a wonderful addition, and worked well, although the green tea also struggled to stand up against the strong flavors. The real winner in this course was the latke. It was sweet due to onion and yam, it was crispy due to perfect frying, and presented as a beautiful nest. I really enjoyed it.The final course was a non-traditional chirashi. Typically, chirashi is a bed of seasoned, sushi rice with a chef's selection of sashimi across the top. While some other restaurants, such as Hamachi, have alternative presentations most are pretty consistent. At 15 East, sweet pickled ginger pieces are mixed into the sushi rice. The tamago is a sweet egg custard, perfectly caramelized on one side and diced. Other elements include sliced ebi (shrimp), diced snow pea, and slices of what I believe was saba (mackerel). The taste was perfect, although the selection of seafood was less than impressive. The picture to the right doesn't really give justice to the portion size, as the bowl is huge and the perspective is off. Justin didn't finish his, and Steve wished he didn't!The food was fresh and the service was stellar. At a table over from us, the wait staff poured a perfect, classic, glass and box of sake wine, and plated a tofu-based dish, although I couldn't really see. The captain offered wonderful explanations of our dishes. And the prices were reasonable. The only true negative was the slightly-slow pacing. We waited slightly too long between courses, and exceptionally long for someone to check in on us after the third course was cleared.I highly recommend checking out 15 East. I will be back there, next time to focus on the sushi and sashimi.

Me Likey: Baker's Edge Pan
CONTENT
I'm definitely a gadget guy. Unfortunately, I'm usually more interested in seeing them than buying them. Here's one more on the want list: The Baker's Edge Pan. Instantly, the unique design makes perfect sense and it's great to see new ideas in the kitchen.For those who want more edge surface area, this pan delivers. And it may even drop cooking time slightly for longer baking items. The official web site includes suggestions for various sweet recipes and, interestingly for a few savory ones, such as great looking lasagna (I definitely prefer outside edge on lasagna)! They say they'll be releasing a special lasagna version soon.While this one is only on my want list, since I haven't tried it first hand yet, I do like that it's gotten thumbs up from some organizations I respect such as America's Test Kitchen, Slashfood, and Cooking for Engineers.So if you're ready, pick one up now, they're only $34.

Surprising Expiration Dates
CONTENT
Ever wonder how long your food is going to last? Well you could check the expiration on each item, but that's just going to indicate the expiration if you don't open it. Fortunately, Laura & Heidi's team over at RealSimple have a surprising, quick reference about expiration dates. Check it out! It also lists expirations for non-food products, but we won't hold that against them.

Fornos Restaurant
CONTENT
After checking Mezzanine, in Newark, NJ, as a potential wedding location, Jessica, her parents, and I zipped a few blocks over to Fornos of Spain for lunch. I have to admit my expectations were pretty low, after all, it's in a very commercial area of Newark. But I was wrong, I really enjoyed Fornos.The decoration is nothing extraordinary, but it's not bad. The menu has a broad selection of seafood, meat, tortillas (Spanish omelettes), appetizers, and lunch specials. I instantly spotted several interesting items and selected the Pork and Clams- a combo I had never heard of. But there was a lot of eating to do before it even came time for that.First the waiter took drink orders: Jessica and her mom requested hot tea, and one for her dad, but he was still parking the car. The waiter brought two teas, and waited for her dad before bringing the third. We snacked on green and black olives, wonderful hot bread with butter and rich olive oil, and fresh garlic bread. Then, in addition to the two breads, they brought a family plate of salad, with a light oil & vinegar dressing.When lunch arrived, we were amazed at the huge portions and how the food was perfectly cooked. Jessica's lunch was broiled scallops, 12 tasty whoppers. Jessica's mom had a mixed seafood plate (actually served in a paella pan), topped with a moderately spicy tomato sauce. The sauce looked like a red Thai curry, but tasted like a Spanish treat, it was the best dish. Jessica's dad had the shrimp in garlic sauce. It tasted good, but was extremely oily (more than a typical garlic sauce). My pork and clams was served over rich brown demi-glace with some pimiento, the pork was cooked just past medium, and while I prefer medium-rare for pork, the taste was great.We were stuffed after the meals, especially because they also included mixed veggies (string beans, carrots, and zucchini), yellow rice, and home-made potato chips.Overall, the prices were very good, the food was good, and the service was stellar. The wait staff to client ratio was amazing, and they did a perfect job. I would absolutely recommend trying it out if you happen to be in Newark. And, especially if you're having a business meal (since just about everyone else there was). Jessica's dad recommends the backup location of Spain Restaurant, a few blocks away. I'll have to try that next time.

Hi there - i'm trying to figure out if 1 can walk from the NJ Transit train station at Newark to Forno's? Any idea? EM me @ julesblog@yahoo.com(it would be 2 people, 1 male & 1 female @ 5pm on a Sat).thanks!

Jules,While we drove, I think Forno's is only a few blocks from Newark Penn Station and is definitely a walkable distance.  Check out this map.However, while the specific area where Forno's seemed just fine when we visited around noon on a weekday, Jessica's father who works in the area says that he and co-workers do not recommend walking around there when others are not around, such as at night or on the weekend.  Newark is known for one of the highest crime rates in the country, although we think Mayor Corey Booker (who we saw speak about two months ago) is making some great changes!Have a great time and please post back to FoodMayhem to let us know what you thought of Forno's!Best,Jessica & Lon

Just thought I'd mention that we did walk from the train to the restaurant - on a Sat @ 4:30 - it was fine, but let's just say if it was myself alone (a female) and it was already dark out - as close as it was, I wouldn't do it. Enjoyed the experience & food at Fornos. We had a nice time (and certainly weren't the only ones sitting down for dinner @ 5pm - on the way out - you can see why!)

Brooklyn Tourism - Dining
CONTENT
Last night Alex let me know about Dine In Brooklyn, sponsored by Brooklyn Tourism, American Express, and many others. Following in the foot steps of Manhattan's restaurant week (which costs $24.07), restaurant-goers can enjoy three courses at these restaurants for $21.12. And if you use your AmEx card at two of these restaurants, you get a free Food & Wine Wine Guide.Personally, I don't partake in restaurant week, having stopped going to restaurants during this time- at least in Manhattan. It was fun early on, but service and quality drop substantially nowadays during this period. So it's not really worthwhile, except to just say you were there.

Agave (Restaurant)
CONTENT
Yesterday, we celebrated Angela T.'s birthday via surprise party at Agave, a Southwestern joint on 7th Avenue, that has brunch. What we didn't realize was we were about to also celebrate an amazingly arrogant attitude of the staff. This place is a thumbs down.Jessica and I arrived first about five to noon, our reservation was for fifteen at noon. Jessica went to check out the ladies room, while I asked to be seated. The waiter (who turned out to be our waiter) stated that they don't seat until most of the party had arrived. The bartendress, then reiterated that our whole party would have to arrive. I reiterated that I'd like to be seated now, looking around to see that the entire restaurant (which I guess seats about 80) was empty except for one old man in the front (a different section) and a group of four in the back. She again said no. I then got to wait at the front, listening to her talk about how her new bar staff was not as stupid as she thought they would be. Good times.Later, after a few phone calls and some arrivals, I informed the manager / hostess who had shown up, that there would only be ten of us, due to weather and illness (it had snowed heavily and two people were knocked out due to food poisoning). She said she would reset the table for ten. I then asked, a third time, that we be seated, noting again that we were a surprise party and didn't want the birthday girl to see us immediately. Again that got no attention. By now a few more people had filled the restaurant, but it was still 2/3rd empty. Further, while waiting, I heard someone ask to sit in the back and get declined because of how many people they were expecting. Be that as it may, by the time we left the restaurant had never passed 50% full.The hostess finally asked us to sit after the birthday girl had arrived and the surprise was less than it otherwise would have been. Perfect timing?What else:We witnessed the busboy sticking his ungloved hands deep into the blue corn chip serving bowl to fill it. Otherwise the chips, tomatillo salsa, and pico de gallo were pretty tasty. Although, I only ate one because I kept imagining licking the busboy's hand. The plate also included some chili-dusted olives. Those were tasty, and I enjoyed spitting the pits onto their brown-paper covered tables, because no pit bowl or individual bread/chip plates were provided.The waiter was decent, although less than attentive. Especially considering the other waiters working and less than full dining room. After watching Alton Brown whip up some tasty looking corned beef hash the night before, I eagerly ordered the Three Meat Hash, with corned beef, pastrami, and roast beef. The meat was cooked properly, but the dish had little flavor, and was far from resembling corned beef hash. Had they called it \"Meat and Potatoes\" (or actually \"Potatoes and some Meat\") it would've been more accurate. The eggs were cooked correctly though. My dish desperately called for salt and pepper (I hate under-seasoned food, especially at restaurants), but alas, none was on the table. After several minutes of attempting to call my waiter over, I got the busboy, a.k.a. Mr. Hand in Chips, to bring over salt & pepper. Then Winnie needed ketchup, he had to bring that over. Don't you love a brunch without any condiments?The pièce de résistance: we brought a cake. We discovered there would be a $4 per person cutting fee. I walked over and double-checked that with the manager and then told her I thought that was very high, it would end up costing us $40 (plus the original cake price) to just eat some cake. I asked her to only charge us $2pp, which I thought was quite generous on my part. She (in quite the unfriendly way) declined and said that they have to charge us because otherwise they're losing out on us paying for their desserts, and how this issue has been discussed with the owner. I informed her that \"No, you are just simply asking us to leave and eat elsewhere.\" Which we did, we walked back to our apartment and enjoyed it there, along with plenty of tea & coffee- which could have been ordered at the restaurant. Restaurants who think they are losing out on dessert orders are plain wrong. First of all, some people would likely try their southwestern desserts anyway, had we stayed. Secondly, they absolutely lost out on the coffee & tea orders, that we all would likely have placed. Those two are probably $50 lost by themselves. But thirdly, thanks to the manager at Agave's incredibly bad attitude and Agave's poor policies have lost the chance of us ever going back. Was that really worth the $40 Agave? I think not.To sum it up: Agave Restaurant has mediocre food; Agave has bad policies; and Agave is not a place I will ever be visiting again.Agave is ass. Do not go there.

Paella
CONTENT
In Chinatown on Wednesday, Jessica and I picked up a huge pile of mussels and mahogany clams, we're talking about four pounds here- they were just so cheap, $6 total. Jess had just under a pound for dinner that night, while I went to Devi.So Thursday night we made paella! While there are many wonderful, foreign dishes that can be found in Manhattan, paella is really not one of them. In my experience, most paella in NYC is terrible, and trust me, I've searched. If I do discover any decent, digestible dishes, I'll let you know.In the meantime, I suggest you do as I do, and make your own paella. It's substantially cheaper than can be bought, although it's still quite an expensive dinner. I've made it at least half a dozen times, and am quite good at it by now. It's delicious to practice! I've included my recipe and below that some notes on ensuring success.IngredientsDirectionsTips for SuccessMangia!

i totally agree with you about the crappy paella available in NYC. i haven't had even a remotely decent paella, since having the best ever in Madrid (yes, i know there's no comparison). but last week, i had some pretty good paella at Solera (53rd btw 2nd and 3rd), you should give it a try.

Andy, absolutely.  I've been to Solera twice, the first time I had the paella, and the second time, someone else (but I of course stole a bite or three).  Their paella is passable, and the best I've had in NYC.  But not worth the price tag.I believe the reason Spaniards can do it right is a one-two punch: they have access to fresh ingredients and they actually care about their food.

Hint Water
CONTENT
Steve snapped this pic with his cameraphone yesterday. Hint is another in a series of water products with subtle flavors of fruits (and possibly other extracts) in them. Other existing drinks include Glaceau's Fruit Water, Volvic's Touch of Fruit, and Kraft's Fruit2O. While I haven't yet sampled Hint, I am not planning on it. I don't understand people's enjoyment from slightly-flavored products; hence Steve's email included the text \"I'm not the only one who likes a 'hint' of fruit in my water,\" based on the numerous times I've mentioned my feelings.Usually I say it when restaurants provide a twist of lemon in the tap water. Originally, I assume, they started doing this to cover up the disgusting taste of their ice water (ice being the cause, based on story after story of contaminated ice). In my experience, most restaurants in the US have delicious tap water, sans ice at least. I do not want a bit of lemon in the water. If I want to taste lemon, I will ask for lemonade -- which I also enjoy. Beverages need to take a flavor stance! Taste like water or taste like fruit, don't go half way.I don't realistically expect the gradient of flavor attitude to subside though. Not when the flavored water market is just getting its feet wet. John Sicher, editor and publisher of Beverage Digest, says in 2006 that bottled-water sales in the U.S. were $15.5 billion, and that flavored and enhanced waters show a growth of about 35 percent versus 18 percent by bottled water. Gary Hemphill, managing director of Beverage Marketing Corp., estimates the flavored and enhanced waters segment to have been as high as $1.4 billion wholesale in 2006. Both of these were published in TheLedger's \"Bottled Water Makes A Splash With Flavors, Colors And Nutrients\" article.It seems to me that many people drink flavored waters as alternatives for boring old spring water. But according to the FDA, these are soft-drinks and not water. But when selling for sometimes twice the price, the huge companies are not going to be quick to mention that fact. And neither will the plethora of new companies trying to sell these lazy flavors. As a matter of fact, every few weeks (including this one) one of these companies is on my corner, at Union Square, giving away tons of product samples.For my two (or actually two hundred) cents, I'm buying only one of two products. For spring water it's either Poland Spring, Fiji, or Volvic (in that order of preference, by cost-value); and for soft-drink it's only Vitamin Water (and actually only \"power-c/dragonfruit\", \"endurance\", or \"energy\" flavors).

I think that the flavored water was a very good idea. I would like to meet the person that created this idea.

Devi
CONTENT
Last night I went to Boqueria with Steve and Charles (a new friend at Renegade Marketing). However, since there was a one hour wait and they don't take reservations we moved onwards. Steve was there first so he called me to let me know- I was three blocks away. I whipped out my Treo 650 and tapped a few buttons in Vindigo, an application every city-goer must have, and called Sala 19. Apparently there needs to be a third tapas bar opened on 19th street between 5th & 6th, because the two there now are already too busy (Sala also had a one hour wait). I called Devi two blocks away and got a table for three.We arrived at Devi, and Charles almost instantly commented on the scene. It's decorated Indian without going overboard, perfect for a casual, after-work dinner. After walking in, I noticed a bit of kitchen smoke in the air, but it seemed to calm down a bit, only to slowly pick up again.We didn't really have drinks (save one beer), but we did share the altogether unimpressive Trio of Samosas (spinach & goat cheese, ground lamb & pecorino and potato & peas). Steve had the classic potato & peas, Charles and I split the lamb and the spinach. All three were tiny and the flavors seemed atypical; the accompanying sauces didn't compliment at all. If I were hungrier I would've also ordered the Kathal Biryani, because jackfruit is definitely rare in NYC, but I had a big lunch in Chinatown earlier that day (triple bbq) so I skipped.Steve had the Khatte Meethe Baingan: baby eggplant, sweet & sour tomato, tamarind sauce. It could easily have passed for Caponata by any Italian's standards. But was enjoyable nonetheless. Charles ordered a chicken with basil sauce- I don't see it listed on the menu, so perhaps I'm forgetting. The chicken was served in two good sized tenders (loin cuts), covered in the sauce, along with perfectly cooked basmati rice (spiced, Indian style). The chicken was cooked perfectly, medium-rare, and the sauce with mild and not over-powering.I absolutely savored my Mirchi Walee Machi: fish of the day, tandoor baked with a roasted pepper marinade and rice on the side. After the cooking process it was hard to tell what fish I was eating, it could just as easily been sole as salmon (more likely the former). It was rare and the sauce was thick and spicy. The rice (same as Charles') was perfect basmati to help cool my mouth.I finished my meal with the Mango Cheesecake, served with a Mango Crisp and Candied Mango strips. It was delicious, although the cake itself was slightly gelatinous in texture. Steve sampled a rice pudding with some type of macerated berries and Charles enjoyed a fruit (raspberry perhaps) sorbet in rose water. His was the most refreshing dessert, larger than an intermezzo portion palette cleanser, but otherwise indistinguishable.I recommend giving Devi a taste, just bring some eye drops with you.

Tredeau Pepper Mills
CONTENT
Yes, Finally! Several years ago, I was in the HBO cafeteria, eating with a friend who works there. The caf. is kind enough to have a great selection of condiments including the not common enough Tabasco. It also had the best pepper mill I had ever used. After a spot of research, I discovered it was a Trudeau pepper mill, specifically the 12-inch Century model. I ran, not walked, to purchase one. I loved every second of its ceramic grinding stone, easy to grip design, and felt padding softening the sound each time I put it on my granite counter top.Eventually, when I emptied my kitchen, I gave the wonder mill to my mom, who had the crappiest pepper mill available, which she still refuses to throw out. In a straight-out search for a new pepper mill, I checked my local restaurant supply stores and they had, oddly, never heard of Trudeau.I found the mill on Amazon. I selected the Trudeau Alero Pepper Mill, because it better matched our new kitchen. It finally showed up today, and I'm so happy I had to share the thrill.As an aside, previously Jessica and I relied on a Pepper Mills Imports' #226, it's a one-handed thumb pump unit. Guests constantly ask us about this particular tool, because of its functionality and design. Jess picked it up at a food show, where it was not actually on sale (long story). It's $32 in PMI's store. It's a great table item. If you'd rather save a few dollars, there is an almost identical mill from Vic Firth for $12 less.

Fresh Ravioli
CONTENT
For lunch today, I scrounged through the fridge and found three leftovers: the sauce from some spicy dduk bok-kee from Korean Grandma; tomato chutney (sweet & tangy from ginger and vinegar) I made to top some tilapia last Sunday; and plain macaroni I boiled a few days ago for my inside-out meatball experiment (which didn't go very well). I combined it all and added some garlic and mozzarella. It was a delicious lunch.However, I broke the cardinal rule and had pasta again for dinner! This time I went all out with home-made ravioli. I picked up some spicy Italian sausage from Garden of Eden along with some washed spinach leaves. I didn't write down the exact recipe, so here goes my best guess (particularly for the filling). In other words, this is a completely unrefined recipe.Makes about 32 ravioli (~5 servings)Ingredients: PastaIngredients: FillingIngredients: SauceThis is enough for three portions.Instructions: PastaInstructions: FillingInstructions: Sauce & Final PrepBon Appétit!Check out Flickr for more pictures of the ravioli.

Chocolate Chip Cookie Sandwiches
CONTENT
An idea for dressing up basic chocolate chip cookies......Use any basic chocolate chip cookie recipe and replace the chocolate chips with chopped bittersweet chocolate. Bake as per instructions and cool completely. Spread a thin layer of homemade or store-bought buttercream between each pair of cookies until all the cookies are cookie sandwiches.I used a peanut butter buttercream recipe in Carole Walter's book, Great Cookies.It was a hit with my guests and looks way more impressive than regualr chocolate chip cookies.There are a few more pictures of these sweeties on Flickr.

Dr. Praeger’s Spinach Pancakes
CONTENT
What it is:Dr. Praeger’s Spinach Pancakes are made in the style of the traditional Jewish potato pancakes called latkes. Dr. Praeger’s healthier version is not fried yet becomes crisp when heated in a toaster oven. You can eat them with apple sauce, the most common latke condiment, or try one of my suggestions below.What we like:Diet-friendly: These low sodium, no saturated fat, and no cholesterol spinach pancakes fit into almost any diet. Plus they’re kosher parve.Individually wrapped: Whenever you’re trying to make heath conscious meals, it always helps to have clearly defined portions. Plus, individually wrapped pieces in frozen products avoids the pieces sticking together.Availability: The spinach pancakes are easy to find in the freezer section of most supermarkets and it’s always great to stock up on some healthy options to have anytime.What we don't like:The cooking instructions on the box give you oven, toaster oven, and microwave options. Only the toaster oven method works well (I use a George Foreman toaster oven, it cooks very well). Broilers in most ovens will be too strong and microwave heating gives the pancakes an undesirable texture.Try these recipes:Spinach Latkas with Cranberry Apple Sauce A twist on a Chanukah tradition. Yield: 3 servingsBreakfast Stack If you like eggs benedict, try this way healthier version. Yield: 1 ServingSpinach Parmigiana Another New York City tradition, turned healthy with this spinach pancake. Yield: 2 servings

I have not tried Dr. Praeger's Spinach Pancakes, but I did test the frozen Potato Pancakes to see if they would be an acceptable substitute for Hanukkah latkes.  Short answer: no.  Real Hanukkah latkes are made from grated potatoes.  Dr. Praeger's Potato Pancakes appear to be made from mashed potatoes.  They are fine as a mashed potato "cake," but they're not a latke!

I like Dr. Praeger's although I find them quite greasy.  I blot them on a paper towel after I toast them.  I am looking for the prefect spinach pancake recipe if you have one!

The fries are still the best thing in the world! The Blackberry and Blood Orange Mojitos were nice but most of the food is just so-so. I didn't like the pulled pork arepas I got. Their version of the arepa didn't taste like anything but deep-fried tastless starch substance. The pork was ok. Lon got the braised short ribs in mole sauce. It wasn't short rib and the beef was not braised but Lon like the sauce. It came with what they call a sweet sticky rice but I thought it was a gross mushy rice. The fried baby bananas were cute. Carol ordered the chicken fried chicken which was fried nicely and very well seasoned but I can get good friend chicken for 1/4 of the cost or less. The collards and squash on the plate were ehh...I didn't taste Sherry's shrimp gyro but she also had their lovely fries on her plate and the waiter was nice enough to bring us a saucer of the brie truffle sauce. Yum!I'm sad to see that they didn't keep the duck meatloaf but they still have some of the same cute waiters and I'll keep going back for those Disco Fries!

Tio Pepe
CONTENT
The appetizers at Tio Pepe were good but most of the entrees were just ok or bad. My entree was terrible! I got the seafood Salsa verde and the sauce was a disgusting starchy and tasteless soup poured all over the plate. The seafood was frozen and when they heated it, they didn't heat it all the way through so I had mostly room temperature seafood with frozen centers and the shrimp were extra rubbery. It wasn't cheap either. I think it was around $26.The service was hilarious! The waiter couldn't understand any English so we (6 people) just pointed to make our orders. With a little struggle we got through ordering appetizers but somehow an extra appetizer landed by us that no one had ordered so we sent it back. We were still only 6 people and waiting for 1 more person when we started ordering entrees. We tried to order for the last person which would total 7 orders but after going over the order with the waiter twice, he still only seemed to have 5 orders. I could almost understand if he had 6 orders since 6 of us were sitting at the table. Somehow we got across that we were ordering for another person with lots of gessturing but when the dishes started coming, there was a big confusion over Jeff and Pete's dish. They had both ordered 2 different types of Paella and the restaurant had 4 or 5 types and the waiters were unable to identify which was which. 2 waiters and a busboy brought the dish back and forth from the kitchen so they could try to figure it out and kept coming back and insisting that the dishes were correct yet couldn't tell us which one was Jeff's and which one was Pete's. With all the commotion, the manager finally came over. Luckily, he spoke English and we finally cleared it up. One of the dishes was Pete's order and one was wrong so now Jeff had to wait for his to be made and the rest of us had our entrees.We were all laughing along the way and no one got angry but in hindsight, it was terrible service!When the bill came we saw the tip had been included and no one argued it. We even checked with the waiter that a certain number was actually the tip and then we paid by splitting it onto 2 credit cards and got ready to go. We were still standing in front of the restaurant chatting when a waiter came out and accused us of not tipping. First Lon cleared up that the tip was included on the bill. When he saw that, he then tried to claim that the 2 credit card payments didn't cover the total which it clearly did and he couldn't add so eventually it was cleared up. He left and we all laughed about the whole experience at Tio Pepe.

Game Day Recipes
CONTENT
Hey Soccer Moms! What are you packing for game day?Peanut butter and jelly sandwiches are the best. No utensils needed, less to pack, and less to clean up. Plus, kids love them! The only question is how to make sure your peanut butter and jelly sandwiches are made of healthy ingredients.Let’s start with the bread. Sure whole wheat is healthier than white bread, but some kids are sensitive to the color of their bread. Stroehman’s new Soft & Tasty looks like white bread, is 100% whole wheat, and tastes good too.When it comes to the filling, look for all natural ingredients without added colors and sugars. Cream-nut’s 100% natural peanut butter is made of only slow roasted Virginia peanuts and a dash of salt: no preservatives, no added sugar, and no extra oil. And on the other side of the bread, Harvest Song has a variety of preserves from Armenia. Without added sugars, they taste amazing, and are lower in calories than most popular brands.It’s really important to get kids involved in packing their food. So together with my friends Ben, Hannah, and Max, we made peanut butter and jelly sandwiches with Stroehman’s Soft & Tasty bread, Harvest Song Strawberry and Apricot Preserves, and Cream-Nut’s peanut butter. Instead of handing the kids knives, mix the peanut butter and the fruit preserves together into a squeeze bottle for fun and easy spreading. You love the sound of healthy ingredients but you’ll be pleasantly surprised by how much the kids will enjoy the taste of them. These healthy ingredients were a hit!Some fun and healthy variations:- Add sliced bananas or raisins to the sandwiches;- Cut the sandwiches with cookie cutters for fun, edible shapes;- Use one flavor of preserves on half of the sandwich and another on the other half;- Make a triple decker!

The entrees weren't as impressive as the appetizers but still very enjoyable. Lon had a nice ropa vieja but it was sliced beef instead if the traditional shredded. I had a good but extra salty paella valenciana. I tasted a diver scallop from Sara which was cooked perfectly, and some of Andy's red snapper that was also fried really nicely. The portions were very generous and the sides of tostones and maduros we got were also good.Our waiter was excellent and Cuba gets extra points for not charging a plating charge for birthday cakes. They even graciously place a large sparkler-like candle on top for you. Even though I have no interest, they also provide free cigars on Sat nights being rolled right in front of the restuarant.Everyone in our group was happy with the meal and I would gladly go back.

Great Burrito
CONTENT
There's probably several places in the city with similar or the same name so this Great Burrito is the hole in the wall is the one on 6th ave and 23rd. I have no desire to eat there (not a pretty place) but definitely worth ordering in. Lon and I each got a burrito, 1 roast pork and 1 house special (Lon's House Burrito shown to the right), and we shared a grilled chicken tortas (their version of a sandwich).Everything was so flavorful! My roast pork was slightly chewy but the way their flavors blend together in the burritos and sandwhiches are just way better than any other place in the city. I can't wait to try more of their stuff! AND, it's so cheap! My only complaint is that they don't have sides.

Taste of Tokyo and Grano Trattoria
CONTENT
Taste of Tokyo gave us very sloppy cuts of sashimi that were very tendonous and a much smaller portion of for the sashimi entree too. The experience was bad enough that I might not ever go back.If you remember my old review on Grano, I had raved about this place! The fresh pasta was plated beautifully and tasted amazing! Lon ordered the same dish he had last time, a cavatelli with sausage and broccoli rabe, and it looked and tasted differently. It wasn't terrible but closer to average. I ordered a maccheroni with meatballs and roasted eggplant which was tasty but the pasta was a bit overcooked and I barely noticed the eggplant. I know I'm going backwards now but our appetizer, a stuffed calamari was also just average and the bread basket was different too. It left me wondering if the chef had changed or was just out. The prices and portions are still good so I think I might give them another shot but I'm not sure......

Our table of 4 (celebrating Justin K's birthday) started with a crabcake, goat cheese stuffed beets, a fresh mozzarella with tomatoes and fresh pesto, and a corn chowder with bacon and shrimp. Every single appetizer was perfect. We were all thrilled and impressed.My filet was the biggest serving of filet any of us had ever seen. It was delicious and cooked perfectly. Yet, it couldn't compare to the meat Lon and Justin ordered. It was a special type of Kobe, not on the regular menu. It was the best steak Lon or I have ever had! It also comes with a massive piece of roasted garlic that spreads nicely on the steak. I also loved the sea salt shaker that i defiantely used. We all shared potato gratin, a corn soccotash, and potato skins as sides. The first 2 were fantastic and I'm pretty sure the potato skins would have been too if they hadn't gotten cold before being served.The dessert were also better than I had expected. Justin had a delicious sundae. Lon and I shared a fabulous peanut butter mousse with banana ice cream. Shayna got a chocolate tart with pistachio ice cream that was good but not as good as the other 2. They also give these little bite sized brownies that come out warm and melt in your mouth. Yum!We all left with a big smile and big bellies.

The service is still fantastic. I did enjoy my seared calamari appetizer but Lon's appetizer of hamachi was boring and both of our entrees weren't very good. Lon had a dish with 2 types of pork and the unattractive looking dish was also a little hard to chew. My crab and skate \"gumbo\" was over-seasoned.I've decided that the only part I would go back for is the dessert. The vanilla bean kulfi which I've had before is still fantastic. The fresh berries served with a yogurt is beautiful and well paired. And since we were there for a friend's birthday, his wife had especially ordered a cake for the occasion which the pastry chef prepared. The rich layered mousse cake was excellent! It was rich with flavor and not too sweet. Each layer, crust, cake, cream, mousse, then topped with ganache, was not so special individually but the combination of textures and flavors was great.

Odwalla’s Vanilla Being Soymilk
CONTENT
What it is: Odwalla created a fantastic tasting vanilla flavored soy milk! (soy milk is a non-dairy beverage made from soybeans. It is often used as an alternative to milk for those who are lactose intolerant or are avoiding dairy.) The half-gallon carton retails for about $3.49 and contains eight servings of eight fluid ounces.What we like: Really Healthy: It’s made from organic soybeans and has only 100 calories per serving. It’s a good source of fiber as well as calcium.Real flavor: It tastes fresh and has a wonderful creamy texture. I’ve even converted some non-soy milk drinkers! Growing up, my family drank soy milk from Chinatown and I’ve found that commercial brands of soy milk don’t compare because they mask the flavor of the soybeans. Odwalla’s Vanilla Being Soymilk adds a nice vanilla flavor without taking away from the real soy milk flavor.Diversity: Even though the soy milk tastes great by itself, it also works in a variety of other ways. Creating recipes for this product was so much fun. It has become a regular in my refrigerator.What we don't like: Odwalla is not available in every supermarket but can be purchased in health food stores and higher-end groceries.Try these recipes:Banana Shake Great for a breakfast-on-the-go or a mid-afternoon pick me-up. Yield: 2-3 Servings (2 ½ cups)Vanilla Oatmeal A very healthy and filling breakfast. Yield: 2-3 servings (2 cups)“Cream” of Cauliflower Soup Creamy curry flavored soup without the fat from cream. Yield: 2-3 servings, (3 cups)

Lon and I ordered their \"Chicago Style Pizza\", half sausage, half plain. The delivery guy obviously didn't hold the pizza box straight because it was smooshed onto one side, affecting approximately 3 slices.That's really not my main complaint. The BIG problem was that the bottom of the crust tasted like cardboard and was completely unedible. Since I couldn't chew it, I just pulled the top layer of dough with sauce and cheese off and ate that. The sauce and cheese were ok but can't make up for the cardboard bottom.I will never ever order from them again!

Daphne's Carribean
CONTENT
So we decided to eat in the Daphne area since it was way cheaper and I wasn't in the mood for a fancy dinner when I could barely see (Olivia had dialated my eyes for the exam). I order the jerk chicken and Olivia and Lon both ordered Stewed Goat. Each entree came with rice and peas, some vegetables, and pieces of plantains. The jerk chicken and goat were both flavorful but luke warm. The rest of the plate was completely cold; not even room temp. It was actually cold like it came out of the fridge and sat on the counter just long enough to lose the chill! We also got some coco bread and a beef patty to share as an appetizer. Both were nice and warm and the patty was thankfully, not too oily.I'm torn about whether or not I would go again because we went during a rainy night, labor day weekend, so I feel like normally they would be better... but on the flip side, there are so many more places to try and I wasn't impressed.

Philly-Gourmet's Sirloin Tip Beef Patties
CONTENT
What is it?This product is 8 servings of frozen beef patties meant to be eaten as hamburgers. Plus they're suprisingly lean with only 4 grams of fat and 130 calories per patty. I know what you're thinking, carb fillers!? None! The patties are frozen with beef broth so they retain moisture when you cook them. And, they taste good.What we like:Easy and Accessible: Buy a box at your local supermarket and leave them in your freezer. No need to plan ahead or to defrost. The cooking directions are easy to follow and cook the meat to medium (so subtract a minute or two from each side's cooking time if you prefer rarer).Affordable: Between $5.99 and $7.99 per box of 8 patties.Portion Controlled: If you're like me and have trouble trying not to eat too much, it's better to use products already portioned for you. Each patty is enough protein for your meal.What we don't like:If you're watching your sodium intake the patties are slightly high in sodium (420 mg). Even if you're not watching your sodium, remember they're already seasoned so don't add any salt!How we used them:The product works best as a burger but if you like the product and want more variety, try some of my recipes or experiment with your own. It's best to keep the patty in 1 piece. If you cut it up, the juices run out and it gets a bit dry.Pizza BurgersOverview: A quick dinner, faster than delivery (serves 2)Steak & EggsOverview: The classical indulgent breakfast, without being too indulgent (serves 2)Beef Patty Marsala Overview: Fancy dinner with almost no fuss (serves 2)To learn more or purchase this product, visit Philly Gourmet.

Anyways.....the decor was nice and the waiter was attentive, maybe overly so. The food was very forgettable. Nothing was impressive but nothing was terrible. We got a few mezes and a few appetizers. The lobster with grape leaves was tasteless. The crispy pork, served with beets, and the octopus served with undercooked black-eyed peas, were both boring and under-seasoned but atlast the octopus was tender. The saganaki was good but not real saganaki.The entrees were a bit better. Everything was cooked to the right temperatures but the flavors were boring. My dish came with a very nice portion of skate but there wasn't enough sauce and the random pieces of sausage and mussels tucked here and there were a little odd and the flavors didnt really fit together. Lon's veal was overly fatty although presented very nicely. It was served on a bed of fava beans in a bad mayo-based sauce that didn't match the sausage stuffed veal. Pete also had skate and Jeff had halibut which I think is a boring fish anyway. The best part might have been my side of what they call Greek fries. It tastes like steak fries cooked in chicken fat and sprinkled with oregano and rosemary. I saw the herbs but didn't really taste them but the fries were nice and crispy.So....the food was quite boring but it was so nice to have dinner with some of my favorite boys, Lon, Jeff, and Pete.

I Tre Merli
CONTENT
We ended up at I Tre Merli, a tiny Italian place that looks more like a bar, and actually has sister restaurants in NYC and Italy). The food was good and bad, but the prices made sense. Lon's squid ink taglioni with shrimp and calamari was very fishy. My homemade spaghetti in bolognese was interesting. The pasta tasted like ramen (which I like) and the sauce tasted like it was grilled? I liked it. Lon didn't. We ordered a side of fries which comes with sprigs of rosemary. The fries were good and everything came out super hot, but we probably won't go back.

27 Lobster and Surf Shack
CONTENT
The deal here is 1 1/4 lb lobsters for $9.95 before 7pm. It is a pretty good deal but they get you everywhere else. The crab cake appetizer is $14.95 for 1 crab cake. It's a very good crab cake so it's ok but the french fries and onion rings are $7 each. It's a very small portion and both were just ok tasting. The lobster only comes boiled but tastes fresh and since Lon's mom's lobster was missing a claw, they gave her another whole lobster for free (after dessert!).Overall, the place was not memorable and current gas prices make the $9.95 lobsters look less enticing.But, Kasi got a great strawberry shortcake from a bakery in Smithtown. it was delicious! Since Lon's mom lives out there, I'll prob visit that bakery!

I was in a group of 7, mostly people who don't care much about food quality, but Lon said he liked it, which suprised me.....and disappointed me.The appetizers came in really small portions but didn't taste that good anyway. The beef and papaya salad was completely overwhelmed by too much fennel. I couldn't taste anything else for about 5 minutes. The pork roll was pretty tasteless. The pillow dumplings were good but how can you mess up deep fried dumplings?Lon and Aviva ordered the fire-pot salmon. Both agreed the sauce was too sweet. I tasted a tiny piece and didn't stick my chopsticks onto Lon's plate again all night, and that is rare! It was drenched in a very sugary tasting teriyaki sauce. What was Vietnames about it? Lon also order the sweet sausage fried rice. It was way overly peppery and I like pepper.I ordered the Hanoi Pork and Meatballs. The presentation was really ugly (and I'm Chinese...we eat organs, feet, whatever). It looked like someone took left over pork chops and cut it in random size and shapes, threw in 3 messy kinda burnt looking clumps of meat, and let it sit in a bowl of some kind of sweet liquid. It came with a plate of plain Vietnames rice noodles which were fine. I ordered a side or crispy tofu in a lime scallion dressing. This was the only dish I thought was decent but again it's hard to mees up deep fried chunks of tofu.The bottom line is....no drinks, no desserts, not really full, a bit below average food, $42 per person!

Only 5 nights after their opening, the wait staff was still nervous and looking to their superiors for instructions. The space had obviously been well thought-out, especially the wavy wood panels of the ceiling and the unique lights hanging by the bar. Disappointingly, Lon said the bathroom was nothing interesting.We had to wait a little bit for our table (even though we had reservations) but we had a peach sake sangria in the lounge. It was good but had the hugest chunks of ice. The manager had just started chatting with us when the host prompted us to our table on the other side of the restaurant.Our waiter had a really soft and deep voice so he was barely audible and he looked extremely nervous, but I give him an A+ for effort cause he was definately trying. We ordered way more food than necessary which is a result of the way the menu is set up and described. There is no real indication of portion size in the several different sections of a slightly confusing menu and the waiter explains that dishes will come as they are ready, tapas-style. The assumption is that tapas-style means small dishes but with the exception of one of our \"appetizers\", the rest were much larger than expected.So this smaller dish was the brisket ravioli. It was the only dish we both completely disliked. 3 ravioli's float in a beer broth that tastes like beef broth, soy sauce, and 2 handfuls of sugar. I didn't taste any beer but that amount of sugar could've masked anything.Luckily, the next dish was one of our favorites....an unagi salad of different charred vegetables (romaine, radicchio, pimiento, onion, etc) with chunks of eel in a very mustardy vinaigrette that was delicious. It was slightly over-dressed but I was so impressed by unique fusion.Our crunchy shrimp and salmon roll appeared next. Nothing unusual....a shrimp tempura roll, iside-out, with salmon layed on top. A mayo based sauce with a little bit of crunchy roe and a hint of wasabi sauce was used on top. Good sauce!Next, the seafood toban-yaki (cooked in a Japanese clay pot) was presented. The seafood looked beautiful and every piece was cooked perfectly in a wonderful yuzu butter. The oyster was one of the juiciest I had ever eaten and the scallop, clams, shrimp, and crab were all delicious. We raved about it to each other as we were eating.I had almost forgotten that we ordered a side of Satsumaimo Pommes Frites (Japanese sweet potato fries). They were fabulous! Perfectly fried, nicely spiced and herbed, with a slightly fruity mayo dipping sauce. I may go back just for these!By now, we're both very full, and the biggest dish comes out: Maple Leaf Smoked Duck.It was a very large portion of duck which came with the Chinese pancakes and fixings like Peking duck plus a mango chutney. The Duck did have the nice smokey flavor but I didn't care for the mango chutney. The duck was also a bit over-cooked and Lon pointed out that they made the slices very thick, but he still liked it a lot. I enjoyed it less but appreciated the concept.Normally, we would have passed on dessert being so stuffed, but it was Lon's birthday and the Apple Toban Yaki sounded so good. It was a great idea, similar to the Amercian Apple Crumb with Vanilla ice cream. The Apples were cooked with a ginger crumb in the toban-yaki and opened at your table where the waiter placed a scoop of honey ice cream on top. It was very good but could've used half the amount of butter.Lon and I talked about our meal throughout and as we walked home and both of us definately enjoyed the experience, even with the few bumps and fumbles....The prices suit the experience. I was satisfied and more importantly, Lon enjoyed his birthday dinner.

Gavroche
CONTENT
The menu here at Gavroche very French and the wait staff wear cute red neckerchiefs. We wandered in unexpectedly because it suddenly started pouring rain so we didn't continue towards our planned destination.We started with the fish board which was an abundant portion of various smoked fish served with creme fraiche, capers, sliced red onion, a lemon, some mesclun greens, and grilled bread. It was delicious. The smoked salmon was flavorful and sliced nicely. The smoke trout was firm and and tasty. The smoked tuna was a great treat and something I had never had. The different combinations we made, topped on the bread was so enjoyable.Unfortunately, the enjoyment of the meal ended there. When our entrees came, we were both dissappointed. The grilled leg of lamb I got was extremely tough and the the grill marks and charred taste overwhlemed the other flavors and all I tasted was the bitterness of burnt. Lon ordered the bouillabaisse and was already dissapointed when he tasted the rouille. It lacked flavor and came with 3 pieces of thumb sized toasts. The whole dish had an overwhelming amount of some unidentifiable flavor that made it impossible for me to eat. Perhaps the combination of too much saffron and too much celery? We did order a side of potato gratin with gruyere and it was pretty good but hte 2 entrees were so bad that I didn't want any of Lon's dish and I only ate 1/3 of the meat on my plate. It is extremely rare that I do not finish my plate and all the remains on other peoples plates! Needless to say, we will not be returning.

I never knew El Cantinero had an outdoor garden/patio in the back. It's much quieter than the rest of the restaurant which is almost always bustling. The service is great. The food is good standard Mexican, not anything special, but the prices are right for a neighborhood joint. The unlimited free chips and salsa is actually quite good.

Mermaid Inn, Beard Papa's, and Cold Stone Creamery
CONTENT
For Stephen's (Lon's brother-in-law) birthday, Kasi chose Mermaid Inn. Lon and I were happy to go again. The menu had changed a little bit but several items were still familiar.For appetizers, Stephen and I both ordered the bacon wrapped scallops which were incredible. The 3 large scallops were cooked perfectly and wrapped with tasty bacon, also cooked perfectly, and the chef balanced the saltiness very well. Kasi ordered cod fritters and Lon ordered the tuna tartare. Both were very good but not memorable.For entrees, Stephen ordered skate, Kasi ordered Salmon, Lon ordered the lobster sandwich and fries that we adored last time, and I ordered the spaghetti with shrimp and scallops. Kasi requested a side from another entree instead of the one that her salmon normally comes with and they were happy to do the substitution. Everything was plated nicely and everyone seemed happy with their meal. The lobster sandwich was just slightly saltier than last time but still delicious. Lon and I didn't think the pasta had much flavor but the seafood was cooked perfectly. Mermaid Inn really knows how to cook their seafood!The service was very good. The waitress even noticed that it was Stephen's birthday (because he was opening gifts) so she stuck a candle in the the complimentary chocolate pudding. I would also like to point out that this is a great place to celebrate birthdays if you want to bring a cake because they don't have a plating charge.Stephen likes Beard Papa's so we decided to head over there afterwards instead of birthday cake. We got some plain, some green tea (flavor of the day), and some strawberry. The strawberry cream was fantastic but I didn't really like the choux pastry. It was too hard. The cream puffs at the UWS location are better.Since Cold Stone Creamery is next door, I couldn't resist. Kasi got her favorite, the birthday cake remix. I tried it and it was way too sweet for me. I ordered the strawberry shortcake and added bananas in. Even though there was only 2 strawberries in it, it was still delicious! The service was happy and friendly.

Barça 18 is really a well designed space. I loved the lights, the leather tables and seats, and the service was very good. The wait staff was dressed in yellow soccer jerseys in support of the world cup so I'm not sure what they normally wear.We order 3 tapas and a paella to share. The first one was a crab meat \"pizza\". It was ok the fried dough crust was flavorless and most of the ingredients were weak. We had the other tapas with our paella so they served us more as sides which worked out perfectly. The salt cod fritters were fried perfectly and came with a nice mayo sauce. The potato balanced out the saltiness and the texture was so smooth and hot inside. The fried pimientos were just lightly spicy and a bit salty. They were delicious paired with the seafood paella that came out nice and hot. The seafood was cooked very well and the flavor was good. We weren't wowed by the paella but one of the better ones we've had lately.The food here is very good, not amazing. But the space is wonderful, good service at very reasonable prices, making the experience very enjoyable. I would recommend this as a great client dining restaurant.

Borgo Antico

Like any other little neighborhood Italian, you start off with bread at Borgo Antico. They offer a regular crusty bread, a focaccia, and bread sticks. The breads are warm and served with a fabulous sun-dried tomato spread.We ordered the grilled calamari over arugula and cannelini beans to share. It was pretty tasteless but they did something really nice and split it for us onto 2 separate plates. The salad was not dressed at all so I wonder if they just forgot or if it was supposed to be like that.Our entrees were a lot better. Lon had the Maltagliati (looks like flat parallelograms) with lamb ragu. The sauce wasn't made in a particularly attractive way because the lamb chunks in brown sauce looked like dog food but the pasta tasted very good. It was definitely freshly made and had a fantastic texture. I ordered the duck breast in a fig and balsamic reduction served with spinach and mashed potatoes. The entire dish tasted terrific as each part individually and together. The duck was cooked perfectly and the sauce was the right balance. I would've enjoyed a few more pieces of fig since there was only 2 small slices but it was really a delicious plate.The menu had a lot of very interesting looking items and the prices were very reasonable. The service was very good and since it's only a few blocks away from our apt, it will probably be one of our neighborhood spots.

Epicerie Cafe Charbon
CONTENT
Crappy food, crappy service, and the place looks ugly too. If you have to eat at Cafe Charbon-Epicerie, first protest loudly, but if you're still forced by friends or family to go (as we were), only order french fries or the shrimp Plancha appetizer.The french fries were crispy and hot, just the way I like them. The Shrimp Plancha is 5 large shrimp, served with heads and shell on, a little spicy, and cooked perfectly.Everything else was awful! Lon ordered duck confit which was really more of a very dry roasted duck leg with very little flavor. Kristine got a flavorless pile of mussels. Vinnie got steak tartare which was raw hamburger meat with ketchup and capers mixed in. Yuck. I didn't try Steve's steak but it looked over-cooked. I had the pork tenderloin which was drenched in an overly sweet sauce and over-cooked. It was served with a huge pile of ok mashed potatoes (even though the menu said gratinee) and the entire time, I felt like I was eating cafeteria slop. Oh, the table also shared the pate appetizer which was a below average and served straight out of the fridge.The service was also horrible. The restaurant was fairly empty yet it took an extremely long time to get our entrees. The waiter didn't understand what a 7 & 7 was (it's only around 30-40 years old) and asked me to repeat my order approx 6 times.The part that bothered us most was that Kristine had been to the restaurant before and had already said it sucked to Vinnie and Steve so I don't know how we ended up going there when there are 9000 other restaurants in NY???

Bistro Citron

On Sat, Lon and I cooked with Kasi at her place for a little family gathering. We had a Middle Eastern inspired meal with hummus, baba ganoush, quinoia, chicken and beef kebabs, salad, grape leaves, and pita. I'll try to post some pictures later. It was delicious.On Sunday, Lon and I went to Carol's apt to see her new kitten, Twinkie. We couldn't find her for the first 10 min but she finally came out running inside a plastic bag. It was the funniest sight ever. The little kitten darted in and out of sight like a little cartoon. I barely got a good look at her but from what I saw, she was adorable.The 3 of us headed out for dinner. Carol had noticed a new Bistro opened in the area and we're glad she did. The waitress at Bistro Citron was a bit confused and the service was very slow but the food was very good for very reasonable prices. Lon and I shared an onion soup and Carol had her own. We all enjoyed the flavor of the soup but agreed that they need to add way more cheese. The salad Citron was fantastic: micro greens with beets, walnuts, onions, and blue cheese in a great vinaigrette. It was a healthy portion and plenty to share. Carol ordered the Ceasar salad which was plated beautifully in a thin bowl shaped shell, perhaps made of spring roll wrapper lightly fried? The dressing was delicious and did indeed include the flavor of anchovies. Lon ordered the steak au poivre which was tender, flavorful, cooked perfectly, and served with nicely cooked vegetables and an incredible potato gratin. The sauce was so yummy and perfectly portioned to the generous steak. I ordered mussels in a tomato, garlic,basil broth and added the french fries. The french fries were very good but I didn't like the mussels that much. It was presented in a beautiful copper dome and it was a tremendous portion but approx 25% of the mussels were wimpy and not so fresh looking. Lon liked the sauce a lot but I wasn't so impressed.I enjoyed the rest of the meal enough to definitely go back and just know not to order the mussels. They had a very large variety for a bistro and yet didn't stray from Bistro foods (some restaurants look like they have very random items that are out of place) so I'd like to try some more items.The bill for all of us came to a little over $70.

We liked the space at Gonzo and the service was good enough, but the food isn't really worth going back for. We started with the small tasting plate (you can select 3 meats and/or cheeses from 17 choices). We got Ribiola, fresh mozzarella, and Cacciatorini with fig and fennel jam. The Ribiola tastes like a super version of whipped cream cheese. I loved it. The Cacciatorini is a fantastic sausage and goes perfectly with the jam. The mozzarella was very average but Lon pointed out that they did have very good olive oil.After that, the meal went down hill......I got the Margherita pizza because grilled pizzas are what they're supposedly known for. It was just ok. Too salty, and after my first piece, I wasn't really interested in it anymore. Lon had the spaghetti with manila clams, also just ok. The food isn't bad but the prices call for above average and most of it was not. The best way to decribe the meal is forgettable.

Beyoglu

I haven't been to Beyoglu in about 2 years and I missed the great food. They make the best charred octopus salad and you can have as much as you want of their freshly baked pita straight out of the oven. The octopus was just as tender as I remembered it but the pita wasn't as consistent. We had 3 pitas during our meal and each was a little different. The first one was only slightly warmer than room temperature. The 2nd was a bit over-baked. The 3rd was perfect, hot, thick, and soft in the center.Lon ordered the Donner Kebab, which comes over rice with roasted tomatoes, onions, and nicely fried potatoes. It was so wonderfully flavorful and tasted even better with all the dips on my platter. I ordered the vegetarian platter because it is a huge assortment of several of their mezes: hummus,stuffed grape leaves, spinach, cacik (yogurt), ezme (mixture of spicy chopped vegetables), tabouli, and Patlican Salatasi (mashed eggplant salad). Every single one was delicious. Lon and I agreed that they have the best tabouli we've ever tasted.We ended with the baklava which comes in such a big portion for such a rich dessert: 3 big pieces. Lon enjoyed it although it wasn't the best. I took a little piece and spit it out. ( I know that's gross but it was way way too sweet for me!) I enjoyed my coffee though and Lon had a glass of grappa as well.We enjoyed the whole meal so much that I barely remembered dessert while writing this. The service was fantastic. Food came quickly, our waitress was friendly, and our water was filled regularly. I'm sure Lon and I will be back soon....probably with Kasi and Stephen since they live in the area.

I was starting to lose faith in the dim sum in Manhattan. Overall, it's defiantely better in Flushing but since Flushing is a far trek for me.....I still try to find dim sum around Chinatown. Many lack quality, variety, and turnover, but Ping's was pretty good. They have all the usual stuff: shu mai, fish balls, roast pork buns, egg tarts, chicken feet, stuffed eggplant, stuffed peppers, stuffed bean curd skins, spring rolls, fried squid, sticky rice, assorted dumplings, and lots of stuff I can't describe briefly in English. We tried a large portion of the offerings and most came out hot, tasted fresh, and had the correct flavor. Ping's is currently the best dim sum in Chinatown.

Caroline and Eddie Song Wedding
CONTENT
My friends Caroline and Eddie got married over the weekend. It was a beautiful and elegant wedding, simple and well organized, exactly what you would expect of Mr. and Mrs. Song.The reception was catered by Upper Crust at a nice space on Horatio St. I really liked all but one of the hors d'oeuvres...which is a compliment to the caterers. The presentation of each was beautiful and in order of favorite to least, the hors d'oeuvres were mini crab cakes, goat cheese towers, Morrocan spiced salmon tar tar on crackers, mini duck crepes, spicy beef Vietnamese spring rolls.The buffet style dinner included the basics of mesclun salad, an assortment of rolls, and roasted potatoes. For main dishes, Caroline chose pistachio crusted chicken breasts with caramelized onions, a salmon dish, and a sun-dried tomato pasta. I enjoyed all 3 but didn't love them. Both the chicken and salmon were very tender, cooked nicely for bulk cooking but the sauces were too sweet for me. My favorite dish on the table was their roasted and grilled vegetables. It was an impressive looking plate with red onions, beets, carrots, asparagus, yellow squash, zucchini, tomatoes, and red and yellow peppers. Each vegetable was cooked perfectly and well marinated.The wedding cake was a yellow cake with buttercream frosting and a chocolate filling. It was a simple 3 tiered cake with a large crystalled \"S\" on top that Caroline made. The cake was plated nicely with fresh raspberries and a raspberry sauce. I didn't think there was enough filling and the frosting was too sweet for me but it looked really nice.

Janny and I have both been to Tomoe before but this was the best visit ever. There was no line! It was a little past 6 and we sat at the sushi bar. The waiter placed little bowls of marinated bean sprouts in front of us and we started to look through the menu.Janny ordered the spicy crab appetizer and the sushi deluxe. I had the sushi/sashimi combo. We were both extremely impressed with the fresh and flavorful fish. It was even better than usual! I normally won't eat tuna because I think it's a tasteless fish but the tuna last night was delicious. I was in shock!Every piece on my plate and Janny's was wonderful and I was also impressed by the selection. Usually dinner specials/combos are just the same boring fish. I got 2 pieces each of tuna, salmon, and yellowtail sashimi, but also got, octopus, surf clam, tuna tar tar, and tamago. The sushi pieces were scallop, red snapper, whitefish, fish roe, a sweet shrimp sushi. It also came with half a roll (normally spciy tuna but I asked for yellowtail scallion)and all dinners come with soup or salad and a slice of watermelon at the end. I was so happy with the $35 dish, I want to go back this week!

Picnic and Outback
CONTENT
It was super hot yesterday but the perfect opportunity to picnic since everyone was off from work for Memorial day: Xiu-Jing, Angie, Sheryl, Sara, Lon, Ice (my jack russell) and me... and eventually Shaun joined us after Sheryl and Angie looked for him for almost on hour.We made sandwiches with ham, turkey, pastrami, American cheese, and provolone; 3 types of bread from Balthazar: a baguette, rosemary, and walnut; lettuce tomato, cucumber, and condiments. We had sides of Kettle Chips (Thai and honey mustard), watermelon and honeydew, an artichoke dip, and cupcakes.We ate, talked, napped, walked, played with Ice.....and everyone was over-heating.Eventually, Lon and I had to get back to cleaning, sorting, and repairing....since we just moved back in to the not-finished renovating apartment the day before.After 2 trips to Home Depot (where all employees really know nothing about their field and mostly misguide you), we decided to just eat dinner next door at Outback. The free bread is really good and our waitress was super friendly and cheery. We ordered crab cakes as an appetizer. They came out nice and hot with tons of lump crab meat and a great sauce. The large portion suprised us and after 2 loaves of bread, we were already getting full. Lon's chicken ceasar came with perfectly cooked chicken and fresh romaine but I didn't like the dressing. It wasn't Ceasar; it was parmesan cheese dressing. I got the house salad with the mustard vinaigrette. It was ok I guess and I knew it wouldn't be great but I wasn't hungry due to the day of eating and both of us were tired enough to fall asleep in our food.

Peking Duck House
CONTENT
After stuffing ourselves with BBQ, my parents asked us if we wanted to have dinner with them. We couldn't turn down peking duck so we headed down to Chinatown. We had to wait about 15 minutes for a table but the duck was definitely worth it.The other thing I love at Peking Duck House is the appetizer of shredded meat, seafood, and vegetables with mung bean sheets. I still haven't found this dish at any other restaurant and I love it. It is so unique. A room temp dish presented beautifully with each ingredient separate so that you can toss it together yourself. The bright carrots and scallions bring color to the shredded pork, shrimp, jelly fish, shredded egg, mung bean sheets, and cucumber. It's delicious.The duck was also fantastic, especially the freshly made pancake/wraps that are served hot in a metal warmer. The crispy skin, juicy fat, and tender and flavorful meat convinced me to eat 4 of them wrapped with scallions, cucumber, and hoisin sauce. YUM! We ordered some other dishes which were all good but not fantastic: The soup dumplings were a bit doughy. The eggplant was a bit too mushy. The beef dish was over-fried with a sweet and spicy sauce. I think Lon really liked it but it was way too sweet for me.I was still very happy with the duck but the air conditioning was blasting beyond my tolerance level so I was eager to leave. I highly recommend going though if you haven't. It is a necessary experience.

Bone Lick Park
CONTENT
After a morning of moving, we were really hungry. Justin, Lon, and I decided on barbecue, which we had been craving for a while.We ordered a ton of food at Bone Lick Park: full rack of ribs, pulled-pork, fried chicken, and an oyster po' boy accompanied by cole slaw, cornbread, french fries, salad and mac & cheese.Everything was mediocre. The fried chicken and cornbread were actually bad. The Po'boy was probably the best item. The prices are too high for the mediocre quality. The service was very good though. Even the water boy was on point and friendly.

Cuba Cafe

Very loud, nothing special at Cuba Cafe.We both liked the yuca and crab croquette but everything else was just ok. The seafood paella was undercooked rice and overcooked seafood just tossed together. It didn't taste like paella. No saffron, actually not much flavor at all. The rustic salad had one of my favorite cheese cabrales but the bacon couldn't compare.We had a passion fruit cake with mango sorbet. The mousse-like layer on top was good but the rest of the cake was a weird texture and lacked flavor.The prices were too high for the so so food.....

Congee Village is my dad's favorite restaurant, maybe Janny's favorite, and tons of other people just love this place. The best food that you can get for those prices but the ugliest decor ever. Service can be rude at times too but they get things done pretty quickly.I've been telling Lon about some of their special dishes for a while and I was so excited to finally get to take him there. We went with my parents and ordered tons of food:Everything was delicious except the last 2 items were slightly under their usual performance.The whole dinner (which was way too much for the 4 of us to finish) cost $77!BTW, this place is great for little parties cause you can book private rooms.

Easily the best burger I've had in years! I love Jackson hole Burgers.Super huge, perfectly cooked, with a very generous mound of toppings....I got mushrooms, fried onion, and American cheese. Lon got bacon, ham, fried onions, and American cheese. We split a plate of french fries and cheese covered onion rings. The onion rings were very good but the fries were just ok and weren't salted at all. The burger was so good that I didn't really care about the bleh fries and still left amazingly happy.The entire bill was $23.90! I'm trying to figure out the next available time that I can go.

Another visit to Raj Mahal

Same great service at Raj Mahal. The food wasn't as amazing this time (read about last time) but for these prices, I'm still going to continue going back. The samosa was good but the pakora was a little undercooked inside which made it mooshy. The crab curry and lamb dish I got had very similar sauces even though they were described as different. Both were on the sweet side but still good. The tandoori salmon was a very large piece this time but not as marinated as it was last time. We did try 2 new breads this time that we both loved! The Saag (spinach) Nan and Mughlai Paratha (meat and egg filled). Perfect textures and flavors. They gave us another plain Nan on the house and a bowl of soup on the house. I can't wait to go back and try more breads.

Kang Suh

We had a nice private room for Becky's surprise party at Kang Suh. Angie and Sheryl went all out with streemers and confetti. The trick candles were hilarious. Becky was blowing out the cake for several minutes and a couple stubborn candles kept coming back.The restaurant had really crappy side dishes....the kimchi, bean sprouts, potato salad, etc.....They all looked and tasted like they had sat around since the day before. Most of the ordered food was very average. One of the BBQ meats we got was flavorless. Maybe they forgot to marinate it? It was also more expensive than most Korean meals I've had so I wouldn't go back. I guess we were paying for the room which was perfect for our little party.

NY Culinary Festival
CONTENT
Perfect timing cause Angie's mom was in town.....Angela junior and senior are both food lovers who just had lunch at Bouley earlier and didn't want to turn down our invitation to another food event. So, Lon got our tickets and we headed over to Pier 94 where the event was supposed to start at 6pm. At about 6:30, they were still first setting up the NY Culinary Festival.The place looked very bare, like half the event was missing. Lots of empty space and empty booths. Even after the $20 admission, you have to pay for each plate, which came in very very small over-priced portions. I thought the reason we paid for a $20 admission was to get good portions of well made food for less than what the restaurant would charge so that we could sample and restaurants could market. We tried tons of things between the 4 of us but nothing was that special and several were disappointing. The best edible item was probably Citarella's layer cake. It was made with many layers of cake, gelee, and a mascarpone top. It was flavorful, yet light, and beautiful, and a good portion for $3. Most restaurants had plates at $5 for very very small portions....a few $8 plates and an occasional $3 or $4 mini-side. Actually, we also had a very interesting curry ice cream sandwich with a sesame cookie. It was well balanced and Lon really liked it.Overall, we were disappointed in the event. There was terrible singer singing covers accompanied by a pianist, ruining classics and favorites - songs from Grease, Rent, and other shows. The chef demo wasn't set up well so if you weren't sitting in front, you couldn't hear or see. The place was fairly empty, constantly giving you the feeling that the event lacked energy.The best thing about the event was an ice and fruit carving artist named Michael Verna. You can check out his website at www.mikescarvings.com He did a magnificent large ice sculpture with 2 fish. It was beautiful. (I'll try to get some pictures up later.)I definately wouldn't recommend anyone going. It's not worth the money and the time it takes to get over there. Luckily, the night wasn't a complete loss. I enjoyed walking home with Lon. It was a nice night to take a walk across Manhattan.Badge has a similar review and a few pics of the food.

Mizu is always packed but aside from slightly above average decor, I can't see why. The noise level is like being in a sports bar and 50 Cent's \"Candyshop\" is blaring loudly. The wait staff rushes you and is ready to grab your plate as you pick up your last bite....even though it was already late and no new customers were waiting for tables.The fish was the most tasteless I've ever had. It wasn't bad as in old......just completely tasteless. If I closed my eyes, I wouldn't have known if I was eating the tuna. salmon, or yellowtail.If you're in the neighborhood, go to Hamachi across the street.

Barbounia
CONTENT
My college girlfriends get together for each of our birthdays. It seems common and simple yet it's the best thing because it guarantees that no matter how busy we all get, we will get together at least a certain number of times per year....it used to be 6 of us, it is now 8 plus boyfriends. So my birthday dinner was a group of 13 and I decided on Barbounia because Lon had recently gone with Steve and Justin, and all 3 raved about the food and service.The decor of the restaurant is magnificent. The co-ed bathrooms are gorgeous. Yet, the menu had changed and service was awful. It started from the beginning. Our table was a high table near the bar and even after 75% of us were seated, we couldn't keep other people from sitting down at our table with their drinks. The hostess and waitress were all present during several occasions and did nothing to help us. We were left to ask people to move ourselves, which caused a couple of minor confrontations and at times people refusing to move at first.Throughout the dinner, several of my friends were irritated by our waitress. She wasn't polite and she couldn't get our orders straight. At some point, a side of asparagus came that no one ordered. We figured that she had put the order in wrong because Lon had ordered a side of spinach and crispy prosciutto......so we inquired and she didn't admit anything but his dish did come out a long time after the rest had arrived. It gets worse....I ordered a side of their fresh bread, which used to be an unlimited complimentary item, and is now $4 per piece. I wanted to try it because Lon had told me how good it was. While I was eating my entree, I reminded our waitress twice that our bread did not come out yet. Finally, on my last 2 bites, I told the waitress I didn't want it anymore. She brought it 2 min later and said they won't charge for it. (Duh, I already finished dinner.) Of course, if it's there I'm going to eat it though. I guess they rushed it and didn't finish cooking it because you could taste the yeast......not a good flavor.The overall experience took away from being able to enjoy the food which was hit or miss anyway.They did have a nice selection of mezes. The shrimp and sardine were just ok. The lamb orzo and the octopus were fantastic. Some people had ordered a couple of other mezes and when I asked Angie about them later, she said they were just ok.I order the whole Branzino grilled. It was grilled really nicely but it's not a fish I want to eat whole again. It's very bony and annoying to eat. Lon ordered the halibut because they ran out of his first choice - Pompano. The Halibut was also cooked nicely and came with a very nicely flavored orzo and cherry tomatoes on top. No one was really wowed by anything. The portions were generous and plating was good but overall very disappointed because I had expectations. Lon was very disappointed that it was so different from just a couple of weeks ago. And, with a large party, 18% gratuity is added on to your bill, which normally I don't mind but, this waitress did not deserve the $80. I'm not going back.

Dylan Prime
CONTENT
Lon took me to Dylan Prime for my birthday because Kasi recommended the cheese fondue and Lon knows that I want to dip everything into melted cheese =PThe fondue (made with farmhouse cheeses) was delicious! The consistency and flavor was perfect. It comes with chopped granny smith apples, pieces of bread, fried onions, and little cubes of bacon between batonnet and brunoise size. The combinations were fantastic and the portion was pretty big. My only complaint is that the bread was just ok and really good bread would've made it even better.Lon ordered the rack of lamb and I got the T-bone steak. Both were the best lamb and steak ever! Perfectly cooked, rich in flavor, looked great, and extremely satisfying. I can't believe I finished the T-bone but it was that good! We each ordered a sauce which on their menu is a separate section of sauces you can have on the side of any dish you order. Lon got an herb bearnaise, which was nice with the lamb, and my black pepper buerre rouge was also very good. I ate several pieces without sauce though because the flavor of the meat itself was so good.We ordered 2 sides: red flint polenta and crispy fries. Lon really liked the polenta and their fries made it to the top of my plain fries list. They came out super hot, beautifully golden, perfectly seasoned, really crispy, and you could still taste potato.The waiter brought out the cheesecake with a candle on top and wished me a happy birthday. The cheesecake was enough for 4 to 5 people but average in flavor and too dense for me, but of course we almost finished it.All of the important items were delicious. I probably won't get dessert there again and I was disappointed in the plain and slightly old looking bathroom but the service was excellent and I'm really happy that I celebrated my birthday there. Still several menu items left that I'd like to try so hopefully, I'll be back.

Grano Trattoria
CONTENT
Grano is suprisingly good. It looks like the average West Village Italian with neighborhood prices. The food definitely takes a step up. The bread and our appetizer was just good but the fresh homemade pastas we got were excellent.Breadsticks are on every table. The waiter then brings Italian bread and their version of foccacia which tasted good to me but just didn't taste like focaccia. It was served with some ricotta mixture that neither of us were so fond of but I don't like ricotta so....Lon would've like some olive oil.The stuffed calamari was good but not memorable. Lots of extra sauce to eat bread with, but maybe that's not a good thing. =P The pastas were way better. I ordered of the \"specials list\", a lemon linguini seafood pasta with a spicy cherry tomato sauce. I don't think it was really linguini, more like fettucini, and I question whether it was really a cherry tomato sauce, but still it was delicious. Wonderfully cooked seafood, nice delicate flavor, and beautifully presented. Actually, both of our pastas were the most beautifully plated pastas I have ever seen. Lon ordered the cavatelli (which was fantastic) with sausage and broccoli rabe. Again, full of flavor, meat and vegetable cooked perfectly, in a perfect portion. What I appreciated most was that all the ingredients were bite-sized. Since we don't usually eat pastas with a fork and knife, I don't know why so many places leave the ingredients in giant pieces. These pastas were comfortable to eat. Each bite could contain pasta, sauce and another 1 or 2 ingredients without stretching my mouth and making me look barbaric while I ate.The menu had so many intriguing items that I'm sure Lon and I will be back soon.

Generally, pretty good flavors at L'Annam L'Annam. Authentic fried rice with shrimp and Chinese sausage, a good Curry Seafood Casserole, nicely sauteed prawns, and all in very large portions. It's cheap for the area and about a block from my apartment. I would suggest that they go lighter on the corn starch but otherwise, it's pretty good.

Aja
CONTENT
Aja is a nice looking place with nice bathrooms....lots of wood and stone, dimly lit, with a bar on the side and a sushi bar in front. The menu is very extensive, covering Japanese, Thai, and Chinese cuisines.We decided to get a soup, a salad, and 2 appetizers, and 1 entree to share. The calamari salad was our starter. Nicely friend pieces of tender calamari scattered across mesculan greens with a nice dressing on the side. There was some grape tomatoes and raisins tossed in. The raisins didn't match the dressing and I didn't like the slight aftertaste in the calamari batter but it wasn't too bad. The crab chowder was a very average Chinese soup thickened with egg and cornstarch. There wasn't enough flavor in the actual broth or stock. The rest of the dinner was better.The lamb kebabs were so nicely spiced, perfectly cooked (medium rare), and came in a large portion. Our only complaint was that some pieces were very tendinous. Next, we got Thai Spiced Chicken Lettuce Wraps. Tender chunks of chicken sauteed with sweet Thai basil and peppers. This portion was also very plentiful and by now I was kind of full (partially because I ate the whole soup because Lon didn't like it).Luckily our entree was light, a beautifully arranged sushi sashimi platter. We were pleasantly surprised with how incredibly fresh the fish was. 4 pieces of sushi and tuna, salmon, red snapper, sardine, and hamachi sashimi, about 3 pieces of each, with a crunchy spicy salmon roll. It was all delicious.We looked over the dessert menu but didn't spot anything interesting....so we stopped in at Dunkin Donuts on the way home for my late night coffee fix.

Bar 89
CONTENT
In celebration of Stephen completing his 6th actuarial exam, we went to Bar 89 because Lon and Kasi (both of whom had been there many times) recommended the burgers and waffle fries. Everyone was disappointed. The food quality had gone down and service was awful. Totally not worth the 45 minute wait. (They don't take reservations.)We ordered a nacho appetizer and it never came so when our entrees came, we just canceled the appetizer. The burger meat was tasteless and too small compared to the giant bun. I ordered a cheese burger and the sparse amount of cheese was only on one side. The waffle fries are average but not even my first piece was hot. It's oddly displayed in a basket with some raw vegetables (a radish, celery stick, baby carrot, and a broccoli floret) and thin slices of melon. There's no dip for the veggies and we didn't get silverware until after our entrees were served and we requested some.The only good thing they have is cool bathrooms with glass doors that fog up when they are occupied. None of us will go back and Lon was upset that he had recommended it to several people before.

Mermaid Inn
CONTENT
Highly recommended! Everything we had at Mermaid Inn was delicious, perfect portion sizes, and great service.Service starts with 2 types of bread sticks. We started with an oyster and bacon chowder. We're so used to getting heavy creamy chowders these days that the image of chowder in our minds is a thick white soup. Mermaid Inn makes this clear chowder so flavorful, yet fairly light at the same time. The balance of each ingredient and herb was superb. The oysters were cooked so perfectly.....juicy, no sand, no aftertaste.Our other appetizer was a lump crab meat cocktail which came nicely displayed with a lemon wedge and 2 dipping sauces: cocktail sauce and a mayo based horseradish sauce. I kept the horseradish sauce so that i could use them for my fries later.Lon ordered the Mahi Mahi which came with perfect grill marks laid on top of a wonderful haricot verts salad. I rarely order Mahi Mahi because it usually becomes dry and flavorless but this one was juicy and the flavor restored my confidence in this fish. I had the lobster sandwhich served with old bay fries and we loved it. The bun looks like a brioche bun the texture is like a soft buttery croissant. It works perfectly with the chunks of tender lobster in a well balanced mayo dressing. The fries were thin and crispy, just the way I like it, and the very faint sprinkling of old bay is just right. Somehow, they manage to make this very fatty entree taste very light in your mouth. The only thing that could've made it any better is if I was sitting on the water in Cape Cod.Already completely satisfied, we're suprised with a little complimentary dessert of chocolate pudding with whipped cream. They don't have a dessert menu and don't need one. Including tax & tip, our meal was about $80 which is well deserved. My only complaint is that they have a very short menu and they only change it 4 times per year. I'm still going back though. =)

Fresh Direct
CONTENT
I've ordered from FreshDirect before and have never really had a major problem. One time, one of the items was wrong....like mustard instead if baking soda but....generally if you know which items to buy, it can be a pretty good deal.After this Sunday though, I would really have to think twice before ordering. Lon ordered a bunch of things to be delivered on Sunday because he was planning on baking some type of cornbread casserole. (Some guys in his office requested it.) It arrived 15 min after the 2 hour delivery window and all the boxes were soaking wet. The boxes being soaked is not really a problem in itself, other than soaking his rug, but the problem is that the bag of flour inside was soaked. I don't think I really have to explain the problem with wet flour.Next problem is that the bag of par-baked breads had all defrosted. Fresh Direct actually has fantastic par-baked breads but should arrive frozen. The idea is not to have to eat all of them that day. So, I'm not done. The next problem is that some of the eggs had cracked in the box and other contents of that box were now covered in raw egg yolk.Of course, we called FreshDirect to have them return the order but that caused still 2 problems. First, Lon still would not have the ingredients he needed to make the casserole. (The earliest they could replace it is the next day which doesn't work for normal people who work mon-Fri.) Second, it took 2 more calls after the initial call before they picked it up, which was after 7pm. The initial call was made around 11:30 am.I'm pretty sure I will endure supermarket lines next time.

Asia Grill
CONTENT
I was sick all weekend and when I'm sick, I usually want pho (a Vietnamese oxtail noodle soup). It's the perfect sick food in my mind. I've been staying at Lon's apt while my apt is being renovated and the only Vietnamese nearby is Asia Grill. They had pho so I gave it a shot.We ordered in and the delivery came in decent time but they forgot my bean sprouts, lemon, and basil. These are essential to pho so we called them and they had someone drop off the missing stuff. They did as I asked and put the raw beef seperately so that it didn't cook by the time it got to me. The beef was good but unfortunately I still would never order their pho again. The most important part is the oxtail stock and this was a beef broth which is so different. I was very dissappointed. They give an excessive amount of rice noodles though...in case you want to have enough for 3 meals. Lon ordered spare ribs with Bun. It was pretty standard. Next time I get sick, I have to make sure I have access to Chinatown.

Patsy's
CONTENT
I was exhausted Fri night so we just went to the Patsy's near Lon's apt on 60th St. It was packed as most of them usually are so we had an appetizer at the bar while we waited for a table. The fried calamari is pretty standard.After we were seated, we ordered a large pizza; half plain, half sausage, becasue I don't usually like toppings on my pizza. I tried one of the sausage slices and actually liked it because they sprinkle small pieces across instead of the large chunks. I still prefer plain though. I consider Patsy's good safe pizza. It's not amazing but never fails.

Zucchero e Pomodori
CONTENT
It was a beautiful night last night so the plan was to eat outdoors. We walked up 2nd Ave and looked at several menus. When we were finally decided on a restaurant, Kasi and Stephen (Lon's sister and brother-in-law) appeared out of no where. Actually, they just walked out of the bar next door, but more importantly, they were also ready for dinner and Kasi had eaten at Zuccchero e Pomodori before so in we went.Dinner was eventful. The table was so sloped that a bread plate flew off and hit the girl in the neighboring table. Luckily, the couple was nice so it actually sparked some friendly conversation. I got to meet one of Kasi's friend, who was flagged down as she was leaving the bar,so she joined us for a few minutes. And, of course it's always great to see family/friends unplanned.FOOD:The menu offers all the standard Italian fare with a few extras. Their pasta section is broken into dry pasta and fresh pasta. I don't really understand why they even need dry pastas but.......We shared an appetizer of clams and mussels. It was a large portion with a good sauce so we went through 2 baskets of bread with the dipping. The clams were the juicy little ones I like but the mussels were a little over-cooked. It was a bit too salty, even for me but still enjoyable. Stephen ordered a seafood pasta and Kasi ordered the gnocchi pomodoro. They both liked it and I tried Kasi's sauce and it was pretty good.Lon ordered the veal saltimbocca and cleverly stuck a spoon beneath his plate when it came, in order to balance out the slant of the table. It was nicely arranged on top of a large heaping of sauteed spinach and surrounded by a very very buttery sauce. The flavor was wonderful. I ordered the fresh tagliatelle with calamari fra diavolo. It was a huge portion of nicely cooked calamari and a fantastic sauce. It came with squid ink linguini instead of tagliatelle so I figured they probably just ran out. I'm not a huge fan of squid ink pasta because it's a little less al dente but I didn't complain because it was still pretty good and the sauce was making me happy enough.I don't think any food was left on our table....Lon and I finished Kasi's sauce with the remaining piece of bread. We glanced over the dessert menus but decided to go to the Dunkin' Donuts right next door. It was starting to get a little chilly and I like the coffee there. Lon and I shared an apple crumb donut that neither of us liked that much but my coffee was really good (each DD varies a bit). Stephen had a jelly donut and Kasi got a vanilla frosted one but only got about 1/3 of it because Stephen and Lon kept stealing pieces of it. Lon took some of Kasi's hot chocolate too but I guess that's what I would've done to Justin so....Lon also got some kind of Nestle Quik banana milk but it wasn't that great....agreed by all 4 of us.The dinner (not including DD) was approx $20 pp including tax and tip. I would gladly go back and just make sure I sat at a straight table next time.

Shila
CONTENT
Shila is that new place in Ktown with the silver exterior. The restaurant is 3 floors and the decor is pretty typical of the newer Korean restaurants. Lon and I both noticed the chairs and liked them. As soon as you sit, you're given a bowl of thick red bean/sticky rice porridge like stuff that is pretty good except that I'm used to this stuff being sweet and this one was sweet with a weird salt flavor that stuck out.There's a minimum order of 2 BBQ plates which is common but still stinks! The menu was kind of confusing because it wasn't broken into the same segments I usually see and they didn't have soon dubu or dok boki.....We had a hard time deciding what to order and I'm not sure if thewaitress was trying to be helpful or just rush us to order something. We finally decided on the broiled Mackerel and Dol Sot Bim bim Bop, which I only ordered because she kept pressuring me and thinking back, I'm not too happy about this because I never order bim bim bop cause it's generally boring and theirs wasn't any better. Actually, it was quite sparse.OK, back tracking a little....the panchan: they had the standard kimchi (avg), black beans (avg), bean sprouts (a little below avg), Korean mayo salad (slightly above avg), and dried cuttlefish in a sweet sauce (good). The had an awful broccoli dish, a cold baby carrot tempura with ketchup, a really good mushroom salad, and cooked scallion kimchi as opposed the the regular raw scallion version.The entrees arrived pretty quickly. The mackerel was a very large serving and was possibly smoked or at least cured before broiling. There was a soy sauce based dressing with some chopped green and red peppers on top. It came with a little stone pot casserole with cubes of potato and tofu. It was a little on the sweet side but I still enjoyed the mackerel and side very much. As I already mentioned, the Bim Bim Bop was pretty tasteless and sparse.They gave us a split orange and a couple of grapes with the check which is common at all the restaurants in Ktown. They have average Ktown prices, average entrees, but below average panchan so I don't think I would go back.

Passover
CONTENT
I was invited to celebrate Passover with Lon's family in Long Island so I hopped the smelly LIRR and headed all the way to Central Islip. I have not been that far from Manhattan since my cousin's wedding last year but it was worth it for the 3 or more hours of food consumption.It started with the traditional bitter herbs, parsley, matzoh.....then the appetizers started: chopped liver (which Lon and I decorated with Parsley), turkey and pineapple skewers, Israeli salad, gefilte fish, carrot salad, lots of pickled stuff (red and green peppers, cauliflower, tomatoes, and regular pickles), a pretty salmon terrine, and a really really awesome zucchini salad. The next course was matzo ball soup. By now, I'm already completely full.More food, an overwhelming amount at rapid speed, comes streaming out of the kitchen: An incredible veal roast with stuffing, roasted turkey, stuffed black squash (with ground turkey and tomato sauce), potato kugel, and bilkes (something like mashed potatoes with onions cooked in chicken fat mixed in and then baked will edges are crispy - so good!)We rested very briefly and then started working on dessert. There was fresh pineapple and grapes, also dried papaya, pineapple, and apricots. I loved the dark chocolate covered Matzoh and chocolate covered macaroons (they had regular ones too). There was a chocolate chip crumb cake and a blueberry chocolate cake, a big bowl of jello with fresh raspberries inside and marshmallows on top. My favorite dessert was one of Lon's mom's specialties - Mandel Bread.Everything was served with a variety of wines, water, and soda, and dessert was accompanied with tea and coffee. I'm sure I forgot some stuff since there was so so much! I left stuffed, in slight pain, and had a severe food coma. I slept on Lon the whole ride back and made it without drueling all over him =P

Houston's and La Salle
CONTENT
We went to the Houston's on Park Ave, near 27th St. I like the look of the place and the couch seats are great.We started off with their famous spinach dip which is delivered nice and hot with warm chips. It's so yummy. The salsa and sour cream that comes with it is good but unnecessary. The chips were unevenly salted so some pieces were good and some were way too salty.You can add a Ceasar or traditional salad to any entree for $5 which is a really good deal because you still get the full size. Lon got the Ceasar which is good but doesn't really taste like what Ceasar should taste like. I didn't taste any anchovy and the dressing is much lighter, closer to a vinaigrette.Before we were done enjoying the dip and salad, the entrees came which was a little annoying because we had to shove everything aside to make room for my hickory burger and Lon's Cedar Plank Salmon (which was a special). The Hickory burger comes with Canadian bacon, bbq sauce, a pile of shredded cheddar, and some chopped onions, on a beautiful sesame bun. You can choose your side. Of course I got fries which were awesome! I ate mine and some of Lon's. =P The meat was cooked correctly and I did enjoy the burger but it didn't live up to my expectations. The pile of cheddar sitting on the top half of the bun was cold (straight out of the fridge) so I asked the waitress if she could melt it. She was happy to accommodate but when it came back, it was just one slice of melted cheese on my bun. What happened to my mound of cheese? That was really disappointing and when Lon asked the waitress what happened, she said that it was because the mound wouldn't have melted evenly. Being a culinary person and being able to see the salamander in their open kitchen, I'm not buying that excuse. We don't blame the waitress; we liked her a lot but I'm still kind of upset about my missing cheese even now, almost a day later. Aside from that, all that stuff on my burger didn't really add much. I didn't taste the Canadian bacon or much of the cheese, and the meat was too small to compete with the giant bun. They do give you a really good bbq sauce on the side and the fries help to compensate. Lon's salmon was cooked perfectly with a good mustard rub. Good but not amazing, but again the fries were so good!I would definitely go back to Houston's because I like the atmosphere, service, and the seats. The prices vary drastically so I would go back to have any of their sides, appetizers, sandwiches, and salads but I don't think the entrees are worth it.On our way home, we stumbled across an ice cream shop called La Salle. The guy behind the counter was really nice, generously offering samples of several different flavors of sorbets and ice creams. The sorbets are made with real fruit and the ice creams are super rich and flavorful. Lon was curious about the pretzel cone so we ordered one to share with dulce de leche ice cream. The sweet and salty balance was delicious. I didn't like eating the cone but loved licking the salt off the cone while eating the ice cream. We were too full to have more but we'll definately be going back there.

Raj Mahal
CONTENT
Lon and I danced up an appetite by going to the open house at Dance Chelsea for the free lesson. We learned the basic steps for American Tango and Swing. We'll probably try out 1 or 2 more schools and then decide on a place for lessons.By the time we were done - 9:30, we were starving! We hopped a cab and headed over to Indian Row where people stand outside and try to pull you into the restaurants just like in Little Italy. We walked into the restaurant Lon's friend Justin suggested - Raj Mahal. There's 2 musician sitting at the door playing and the friendly wait staff is ready for you. We loved our waiter from beginning to end!As most Indian restaurants, papadum and some sauces are placed on the table. Their green sauce is better than most. We were so hungry and of course ordered so much food! A very thick, slightly creamy tomato soup came out first. I didn't care for it that much but Lon enjoyed it. We both loved the samosa and pakora though. Not too greasy, perfect temperature and textures, with abundant flavor. I think we got the Keema Naan next which is a ground meat filled Naan. I was in heaven. The hot, soft, puffy bread, straight out of their oven. MMMMMMMmmmmmmmmmmm!Lon also ordered a really good banana lassi.OK, now entrees......the shrimp Saag (creamy spinach sauce) was so good that I ordered some Paratha towards the end of the meal just so I could eat more of the sauce. Well that, and I love Indian bread so I just wanted the buttery layered bread. The tandoori Salmon is unreal! It was cooked so perfectly and looked gorgeous! The flavor was so intense and seemed cured and smoked yet I'm not sure if it was really either. The seafood curry was good but not as good as the rest of the stuff and everything came with the standard basmati rice and there was also a lentil sauce that I didn't really use because it was kind of bland.Our friendly waiter checked in with us regularly and after we licked the plates clean, he brought out the complimentary dessert. It was a mango, coconut, egg custard. Both of us liked the flavor but would've preferred it without the strands of coconut in it.Overall, we'd both highly recommend this restaurant. It was totally enjoyable and after tax and tip would be about $20 per person if you eat as much as we do.

Dong Hai, bur better Dessert

Last night I went to NTDTV's post-gala reception which was held at a Chinese restaurant: Dong Hai. The food was not bad but not great so I don't really feel like talking about it so...Lon and I walked home and decided to stop at the supermarket for some juice. The voyage for OJ turned into a peach crumb cobbler and a pint of Ben & Jerry's Chunky Monkey. We put the cobbler on the bottom of a large bowl, scooped ice cream on top, and topped it off with salted and roasted peanuts. MMMMmmmmmm.......I'm sorry, we forgot to take pictures. =P

Land
CONTENT
We went to the UWS last night to visit Lon's friends, Bill and Emily, who have a 2 3/4 year old named Ben and a new baby named Samantha Jane. Since we were up in my old neighborhood, we also planned on visiting Carol of course. In between, we had dinner close by.Land is a very, very narrow place but they managed to make it look pretty nice. The bathroom has the weirdest sink because water fills into this clear horizontal tube that has 3 slits in the middle. That's where the water falls downward onto your hand and then just keeps falling down towards the rocks on the floor. It's a cool idea but I don't think it was executed so well.We ordered the Curry Chicken Puffs and the Green Papaya salad to start with. Both were very good. We enjoyed the appetizers a lot more than the entrees. They were bigger portions and tasted better. The beef in our Pad See Eww was way over-cooked, rubbery and really took effort to chew. It also lacked flavor and was skimpy on the eggs, but oddly had cauliflower in it. I liked the red snapper a bit more. It was fried and laid on top of some baby bok choy, snow peas, scallions, and grape tomatoes. The fish and vegetables were actually pretty good. It was just that the sauce was a bit too sweet for me.I'm disappointed because I had eaten at Land with Carol back when they first opened and we both really enjoyed it. When I asked Carol if she had eaten there again, she said no because she had ordered-in a couple of times and already started to notice the quality going down. Yet another place that couldn't keep up. =(

Trattoria Pesce Pasta
CONTENT
Welcome Spring! Lon and I went roller blading through Central Park last night. It was gorgeous out! Of course we were starving afterwards....so we went to this good neighborhood Italian on 59th and 1st called Trattoria Pesce Pasta. I know I usually don't give location details (because I think you should be able to look it up yourself fairly easily) but this time I'm giving the cross streets because there are so many Italian places with similar names. I swear I've been to one on East 3rd or East 4th with a similar name and also one on the UWS.So moving on, they have mediocre bread, not great olive oil, but a good balsamic. We shared a prosciutto and melon appetizer. The cantaloupe was great and the prosciutto was perfectly not too salty (as some are). I would've preferred it sliced thinner but it was very enjoyable as is.They have a very standard Italian menu so we were much more interested in the specials. Several sounded great and I always have a hard time deciding so I'm really glad we had a very nice and helpful waiter. Lon had the farfalle seafood fra diavolo. The seafood was cooked perfectly and included the juiciest mussels! I loved the light tomato sauce. I had the trout which was deboned and laid out beautifully on a white wine, lemon, caper sauce. Again, cooked perfectly. Unfortunately, the side of broccoli was over-cooked and pretty tasteless. It was also really odd looking that there was a small piece of potato and a piece of a carrot on my plate. It was totally unnecessary but I'm not complaining! I really enjoyed my meal.There isn't much to the decor to this place, just dark wood everything. The prices are good. Service is good, and good food. I'd go back.After chatting for a little bit, we went down the block to check out Guastavino's but it hasn't re-opened yet. So instead, we walked around Food Emporium for a really long time, talking about food. =P

Mare
CONTENT
Mare is a pretty ugly restaurant but it's got decent prices for seafood.I got an octopus salad appetizer (a special) which was pretty good but very heavy on the green olives. Lon had a really good shrimp bisque and Janny had a pretty terrible New England Clam Chowder that tasted more like really salty potato and celery puree thinned out.Janny had the grilled Atlantic Salmon. It was fresh and cooked nicely but had a sweet sauce on top which I didn't like on the salmon. It came with really good mashed potatoes with bacon and peas mixed in. Lon and I ordered from the specials the waitress had suggested. His was a seafood risotto. It was a large portion of fresh seafood but the risotto wasn't really risotto. It was just some rice (not arborio) mixed in with a very salty white seafood sauce. I ordered the Mako Shark because our waitress kept raving about it being her favorite. I was pretty disappointed. The 3 of us agreed that it tastes a lot more like pork than Mako but the pineapple sauce on top was pretty good. It also came with a side that tasted like home fries with corn in it. I liked the side more than the rest of my dish but it didn't compliment the dish at all and visually wasn't a match either.They did have fresh seafood, cooked to the correct temperatures, and good portions. Some flavors were really good too. I think the problem stems from not knowing where to put what sauces and what sides. So if I go again, I'll stick to the simple stuff...raw stuff, fried stuff, or just broiled.

Gradisca
CONTENT
Gradisca has very good authentic food but I don't think I'd go back. My brother, Lon, and I shared a mussel appetizer. Great tomato sauce with just a little kick. We wiped the plate clean with bread but the bread wasn't the best which doesn't really make sense considering that they leave very good bottles of olive oil and balsamic on the table.They make fresh pastas (and grandma was sitting at a table right out front doing it for everyone to see) which is always a big plus in my book. Lon ordered the Papardelle with a lamb ragu which was very flavorful but sort of lacked that al dente bounce. I had a unique dish that was made like a lasagna but instead of pasta, it was layered with fried zucchini and hard boiled eggs between the sauce and cheese. I loved the flavors and textures but I can't justify paying over $20 for that again considering my 2 complaints about Gradisca:1. My brother ordered the Scallop which was delicious but it didn't come out until after I had finished my entree already and Lon was half way done with his. If it wasn't my brother, I prob would not have eaten until all the entrees had arrived and then my dish would've tasted awful cold.2. The space was very ugly.

Morimoto
CONTENT
Where do I begin? A month of anticipation till our reservation at Morimoto NYC on the 26th and yet we still had to wait 40 min for our table. When the host was asked what the delay was, his response was that they had a full house. Don't they always? That's why it takes a month to get reservations......Fortunately, we shared a fantastic drink at the bar downstairs. They call it White Lily: Shogu, Calpico, Yuzu, and maybe something else. Perfectly balanced.The design gives a clean and spacious feel yet the tables were set too close together. It was hard to pick up chopsticks that seemingly every table dropped. Luckily, our \"neighbors\" were friendly because we were all enjoying each others' conversations. I tried not to listen but Lon said the wife was constantly complaining about each dish and almost didn't stay for her final one. (I think she had the tasting menu.)We decided on 3 appetizers:The Curry Beef Bread arrived first. The dough seemed mochi-like in texture but covered with panko on the outside and deep-fried. The filling was a typical Japanese style ground beef curry. The combination of flavors and textures worked very well.Next (and best dish all night) was the Spicy Crab. The Crab Legs are fire roasted, opened, and served with a fantastic spicy aioli with crunchy roe mixed in. Simply delicious!The 3rd appetizer was a Japanese antipasti with 5 items. We tried the duck meatball first. It was dry. The snapper was wrapped in a corn husk with a lemon on top. Good, but nothing special. There was a sesame tofu cube with some black roe on top....also not special. A piece of smoked salmon sushi was wrapped in a lotus leaf and I liked the added flavor from the lotus leaf but Lon wasn't impressed. We both like the lobster consommés but the best thing about this dish was the incredible presentation.At this point, we're satisfied but not wowed. By the time we were done with the entrees, we were pretty unhappy. The 20 oz Rib Eye was just a piece of average rib eye with a teriyaki jus poured on top. Nothing near what you'd expect from the Iron Chef. It didn't come with any vegetables, rice, or sides, not even a garnish....just the slab of meat. The Japanese Bouillabaisse came out in a beautiful pot and looked fantastic. It was half a lobster, a crab leg, 2 sea scallops, 2 shrimp, 3 mussels, 3 clams, and some oyster mushrooms. Beyond looks, the broth was tasteless other then the overwhelming amount of butter and all my bi-valves were dead. The lobster wasn't fresh. The flesh was mush and the whole dish was just boiled and over-cooked.I decide to point out to the waitress how all the mussels and clams were visibly shut and obviously I couldn't eat them. She apologized and came back and offered a dessert on the house. That's nice but doesn't really make up for the fact that a good portion of my entree was inedible. They didn't offer to replace the 6 pieces and dessert is not an equal trade.For dessert, Lon picked the chocolate tart with white chocolate sorbet and I chose the creme brulee with earl grey ice cream. The chocolate was a nice dark chocolate but the tart crust was dry and tasteless. We both really liked the creme brulee which was flavored with some sort of Japanese fruit that gave it the perfect tang and lingering taste. I also enjoyed the earl grey ice cream but didn't agree with the pairing. It wasn't bad together but definitely did not add either.We were both pretty unhappy with the meal, especially considering that it's about $100 pp. The experience was bad enough that both of us have been complaining to co-workers and friends and family today.

Another good neighborhood sushi place! Hamachi is a nice, well-lit space with good service and a very large menu for a Japanese restaurant. The prices are right on for large portions of equally good, cooked food and raw.They also give you a little bit of banana tempura and ice cream at the end of your meal. We'll definitely be back.

Boyd Thai
CONTENT
I still haven't found Thai food in NY that I'm really impressed with. Boyd is a step above the typical Thai place in quality but the portions are just a bit smaller.They do cook fish very well. I tried a bite of Sara's Sea Bass (great sauce on this one) and I had the Orange Roughy. Both were perfect in doneness. The Pad See Eww was way too sweet for me.The desserts are pretty good and and oddly bigger portions. We tried the mango and sticky rice & fried banana with red bean ice cream.My lasting impression though is that the room was so ugly. The square room had a speaker in each corner but only one was on so it bothered me. It gave me the feeling that the music wasn't from the room but maybe just some noise coming from the next room.I doubt I'll go back. I think Klong and Isle are better.

Taste of Tokyo is what I call the perfect neighborhood spot. It's small, quiet, and clean, and still unknown enough that there was no wait. The portion sizes are HUGE; they have good prices (avg meal inc tax & tip is $25/person) and good food.I got the Chef's Special:Lon got a Salmon Teriayki Bento Box:I think I'm forgetting something in this box.Both meals included miso soup and salad. The dressing wasn't as good as most Japanese house dressings but both of us enjoyed the meal and will probably go back.

Buttercup Bake Shop
CONTENT
We gathered in Ktown for my cousin Vivien's birthday and ate at Seoul Garden, my favorite restaurant in Ktown. The BBQ squid was kind of overcooked but everything else was really good as always. I ate way too much!BUT, like my mom always says.....Dessert goes in a separate stomach. (I really wish that were true.)So we hopped in cabs and headed over to Buttercup. I didn't really like the service but most items were really yummy. I highly recommend the banana pudding! The yellow cake with chocolate frosting is also really good and just as the classic should be. I wanted the strawberry rhubarb pie but they don't sell it by the slice so we got something they call raspberry sour cream bun. It looks like a muffin. It was dry and tasteless. I was so dissappointed! It tasted like those muffins that are like sugar-free, fat-free, eggless, and devoid of anything good. Yuck! I didn't taste any cupcakes but everyone looked happy with them. My coffee was cold which is a major peeve of mine but I'd still go back, just for the banana pudding.

Diner 24 revisited
CONTENT
I needed another dose of their Disco fries since it was over a week since I last had them. I ventured over with my brother and Janny. Lon met us there. Justin and Lon had just eaten so they basically did some tech chat while Janny and I scarfed down 2 bowls of their heavenly fries covered in melted brie accented with truffle oil. The first bowl was better because it was nice and hot. The second bowl was room temperature.....still good but......Here comes the bad part: I ordered the Cuban sandwich. It didn't taste anything like a Cuban!!! It was just some roast pork between toasted hoagie bread, not pressed, no pickle, didn't taste any cheese....what the? Very unhappy!Janny ordered a Cesar salad which was presented really beautifully but totally impractical sized pieces of romaine to eat and she said it didn't taste that good because there wasn't enough dressing. =(Lon had a Float, made with vanilla ice cream and a raspberry flavored soda. I thought it was gross but Lon liked it.So after last night I came to the conclusion that you can't just have blind faith there. Here's the list of items you can confidently order:

Cookshop
CONTENT
To start, Cookshop has good bread, rock salt and a pepper mill on the table, and a fantastic concoction of creme fraiche with chopped caramelized onions and some other stuff (can't remember). I like the clean and comfortable look of the restaurant and the beautiful open kitchen. Lon liked the silverware.We started with a smoked trout appetizer paired perfectly in taste and quantity with some fromage, thinly sliced grapefruit, and an excellent arugula salad. It was a really nice appetizer to have with champagne even if it was just a so-so champagne.The entrees are broken into categories based on preparations methods: Sautee, Grill, Wood Oven, and Rotisserie. We ordered Skate Wing served with roasted fennel (Sautee) and the Strip Steak served with creamed collard greens and giant onion rings (Grill). I wanted the duck but they didn't have it. =(The portions were huge. I think I had 4 skate wings which were battered and pan-fried perfectly and didn't taste greasy but were slightly over seasoned and the fennel was slightly under-seasoned. There was an herb and caper gremolata on top but it was so little I barely tasted it and at the end I felt like the dish just needed something more to it. It got boring. We ordered the steak medium rare but it came closer to medium. The onion rings were just good. The creamed collard greens were really good but nothing amazing considering shoelaces would taste good with that much cream and lardons.We were so full but still ordered dessert because I really wanted to know what their ice cream sandwich tasted like. Unfortunately, it was pretty disappointing because it was nothing special: a thin chocolate cookie with chocolate ice cream served with 2 tiny pieces of banana, some hazelnut, and a pool of caramel.I'm torn about whether I would go back. I wasn't really impressed by either entree but didn't dislike it either. The appetizer was great but the dessert fell short. The draw is that there's so many interesting things on the menu that I want to go back to try them but in hindsight, I think they just have really good menu writers.

En Japanese Brasserie
CONTENT
A beautifully designed space just might not be a good thing all of the time. At EN Japanese Brasserie The high ceiling, open kitchen, comforting earthy colors and textures, complete with servers in Japanese garb set up an expectation for me that just was not met.We took suggestions from articles/reviews and their own website and ordered the warm hand scooped tofu and the potato and duck mochi as 2 of our appetizers. The tofu was so disappointing. It was fresh but very bland and the texture was just average at best. The mochi was probably my favorite savory item of the night. One, it was something unique. It was a savory mochi (most are sweet) with the added textures of potato and bits of ground duck, sitting in a very flavorful thickened broth. The flavor of the duck doesn't come out though...could've been any meat.We also ordered 2 other appetizers: shrimp fritters and fried chicken. Both were good but nothing special. Shrimp fritters were just like the ones I get at dim sum. You can't really go wrong with fried chicken as long as it comes out hot, which it did. All the appetizers were good portion sizes so by the end of the appetizers I was not impressed but not too upset either.On to main courses, I got the \"highly recommended\" braised Berkshire pork belly. This was the biggest disappointment! First of all, it tastes just like the Chinese style braised pork belly that every Chinese mom makes at home (you guys know what I'm talking about)but not as good. Second, it was an appetizer portion, 3 little cubes with 2 pieces of daikon and 2 leaves of spinach. AND, to accentuate the child-sized portion, it's swimming in a sea of sweet broth in a gigantic family sized salad bowl that I could probably sit in.Lon ordered one of the specials, a whole perch in a sweet soy sauce broth. Again, nothing exciting in terms of the flavors but the fish was fresh and a good size. Here's where a problem comes in though. The fish didn't come with any vegetables or starch. I'm fine with family style Chinese restaurants where you order protein and/or vegetable dishes separately from rice or noodles but there was nothing on the menu to indicate that you were supposed to order in that way. The waitress didn't suggest it either. More than half way through the meal, we just ordered rice, realizing that there was something missing from our meal and now that I think of it, the 2 leaves of spinach (barely garnishing my dish) were the only vegetables that we (table of 4 people) ate.Their redeeming moment comes with the dessert, especially because lately desserts have not been memorable. Lon ordered a molten chocolate cake with green tea ice cream. Nothing new but they do it well. I ordered the soba tea pudding almost purely because I have never heard of it before. It was SO GOOD! I liked it because it was smooth and creamy with a really strong tea syrup but not very sweet. Sal had some vanilla ice cream on top of mashed sweet potatoes and Rochelle had 3 house-made ice creams: pumpkin, white sesame, and forgot the last one but they were all good.Overall, I wouldn't recommend this restaurant but it was less expensive than I had expected so if you still want to give it a try....I also felt like everything was really Chinese food except for the mochi and the desserts so this is not the place to go if you're looking for Japanese food.

Sala One Nine
CONTENT
I had dinner at Sala on Tues night and just wanted to note that I liked it... They have a wide selection of interesting Tapas so the 4 things I had that night were good enough to make me want to try other menu items. The service is pretty fast and I liked the atmosphere......chill with comfortable lighting.So the food:2 tostas: One was a seared yellowfin tuna on top of baby spinach with some caramelized onions. It was really good and I don't really like tuna that much. They seared it perfectly. The second one was a baked brie with Serrano ham. The flavor match was nice but I would've prefered the cheese a little more melted.Some sort of veggie croquettas: They were fried so perfectly so that they weren't greasy. They were served nice and hot, thin crisp outside with super soft melt-in-your-mouth inside. I can only recommend that they season it a bit more.Grilled Calamari: This was the best one. It was perfectly grilled....nice and tender with some sort of herb garlic sauce/paste...and lemons to squeeze. AND....it was such a huge portion for a tapa.In general, the portions were big for tapas, reasonably priced, and I've been to the sister restaurant on Bowery and that one is good too. I remember a good Paella, good fried goat cheese, and some kind of bacon wrapped dates that were stuffed with almonds?Happy Eating!

Worst Diner Ever!
CONTENT
First, I want to make a shout out to my Streak family and all the new members!So after the auditions yesterday, we went to Hollywood Diner to deliberate. I ordered a buffalo cheeseburger because I figured burgers are the safest options at diners. Plus, they come with fries and I have to eat fries whenever possible. Back to the point - It SUCKED! First of all, I realized when I got my food that they didn't even ask me how I wanted it cooked so it was well done. I DO NOT eat past medium rare!!!!!!!and the cheese was already cold, actually the whole burger was already cold and the fries were just ehhh......AND I don't even think it was a buffalo burger.Oh yea, we got potato skins with cheddar and bacon to share and that sucked too! I don't even want to get into the details of why that very easy dish was somehow destroyed but the whole thing was just a bad experience (service sucked too) and I will never go there again and I will try to tell as many people as possible because I want to save you all the pain. Trust me...PAIN!

Korean Grandma

I'm so sad.....yesterday, I was walking home and noticed that the Korean deli on 5th Ave and 13th St had closed. No advanced warning.....Closed! ......\"Store for Rent\"Ok, so yea, there are tons of Korean delis in NY, but this one had a special little grandma on the 2nd floor that made homestyle Korean food. It was a ghetto set up with just basically a stove in a 6′x6′ box where the cutest little grandmother stood and prepared food. It was cheap, open really really late, and the Kalbi Tang was the best I ever had (and totally verified by my Korean friend Joey). I'm going to miss my Korean Grandma, who always tried to talk to me despite the language barrier. We never understood each other but I'll still miss our conversations and definitely her food!

Diner 24
CONTENT
This past weekend was a good one because I ate at Diner 24 twice! After Winnie's birthday party on Fri (at 6s and 8s) we (about 10 of us?) went to eat at about 3 or 4am. Of course we got Disco Fries because their Disco Fries are the main reason for going there. The fries are nice, thin, and crisp with a nice balance of melted brie and truffle oil drizzled on top (with plenty to spare on the bottom) and a sprinkle of herbs. To me, it's heaven in a bowl. Two of my favorite things (french fries and cheese) in harmony together. But now, late night dining is even better. They have the best onion rings now too! It's only on the late night menu (12am-6am) and it's a small portion but so GOOD! They're think cut slices with just a really thin layer of crispy, well seasoned batter. Now is the sad part....I wanted to try another new item they offer - meatballs. It was very bleh. It uses the sames sauce from their duck meatloaf (which is a big portion and really good) but the meat itself is flavorless and kinda chewy in a wierd way. Very disappointing.On a happier note, I went to Diner 24 again last night after closing up Cassava. Janny and I braved the record blizzard to get Disco Fries. Unfortunately, it was still too early to get the onion rings but the huge bowl of golden fries with melted brie and truffle oil sauced over quickly helped me over come the dissappointing news.....but after we finished, I did ask Janny if she wanted to wait cause it was almost 12 and then we could get the onion rings. =)Ok, so I got the \"24 burger\" with caramelized onions, mushrooms, and american cheese. I like their burgers cause it's a nice big chunk of meat and when you order medium rare, it comes medium rare! It comes with fries so I got to use up the left over brie truffle sauce too. Janny got the duck meatloaf which is so good that I hate calling it meatloaf. It comes with mashed potatoes and a great brown sauce, scattered with peas and mushrooms, and lots of fried onions on top that stay crispy.Yum!

FreshDirect Warning!!
CONTENT
City-dwelling friends:As you know I'm a huge proponent of online services -- and you've probably seen an email from or talked to me about FreshDirect. I've used them a few times now and twice in a row they've mysteriously left items out of my order -- with no notification or reason for me to believe they've credited me. In fact, I called them this time because they left out two important items from today's delivery -- and the customer service rep told me she would credit my account. I said, \"Of course you'll credit my account, I didn't get the food!\" Last time they left $6.30 out of my order; this time $2.52.I advised the CSR to do something to maintain me as a client, as I'm an unhappy, she said she could give me a credit for a free delivery -- a value of $4. I told her she should at least give me two, since they've messed up twice and it was over $8 worth of problems, she said she can't.I am not saying do not use FreshDirect, I'm saying watch your orders, check your receipts, and then CALL THEM if you are missing items, or you are not going to get your money. Also, I advise not relying on them, as I did this time, if you are going to be in a time crunch.Because I don't like to talk behind people's backs, I have cc:ed them on this e-mail. Please feel free to forward this to anyone you know who might use FreshDirect -- so they can be warned too.Regards,Lonp.s. I guess I'm not done visiting supermarkets.. bleh.

A true fusion of 'Tex' and 'Mex' style chili. I've made this recipe dozens of times, and it is great. Each bite slowly delivers a sweet flavor followed by dry heat afterwards. It takes a while to prepare, but well worth it. You can use any type of beans you like, and try different dried chile varieties.Over time my recipe has gained popularity, being rated 4.5/5 on AllRecipes.com. I love reading people's feedback.
