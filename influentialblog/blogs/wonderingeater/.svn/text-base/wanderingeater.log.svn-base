For the morning, I went to Amy's Bread in West Village located on Bleecker & Leroy St. The only thing that appeals to me at the moment was the oat scone ($2.50). It's crunchy on the outside, chewy and soft in the inside. It contained a ton of oats, raisins (both golden and regular), possibly chopped dates, and chopped walnuts. All of those fruits and nuts have a great combination of flavors: the walnuts and oats gives it a nice nutty flavor since both gets toasted while it bakes, and the walnuts gives it a subtle bitterness. The dried fruits gives it a sweet and chewy contrast to the crunchy, nutty flavor. It's wonderful; I want to bake a scone like this.The next stop is Joe's coffee, yes again but this time it's around Union Square off 5th Ave & E 13th St. As you can see, it's packed with people for the morning rush (it was taken around 9 AM). It's insanely crazy for how Manhattanites and local college kids (like myself) depend on caffeine to keep the pace of life that is greatly celeric: it seems like everyone has so little time to do everything and it's very hectic.The place itself has a casual, upbeat vibe. During the off hours of the morning rush, it's a very calm place where anyone can hangout and chat or read the day's paper. As for the coffee, their house, the Vienna Roast is soo good. It's strong, bold and smooth. My type of coffee and it's my favorite, hence me being a follower for over 5 years of Joe's. When it comes to their espresso and espresso drinks, these days I'm finding it a hit-or-miss. Sometimes I can get a great espresso or there are days when I feel it's a bit bland or diluted; back then it used to be spot on. Probably they need to retrain the new baristas again.It's about 4:30 when I met my friend, Kim for dinner before the Carnegie concert. We ended up deciding to go to Cafe Europa, located at 255 W 57th St., for the main entrée, since we both didn't want to eat a huge meal. We ended up splitting a Sloppy Joe Pressata ($6.25, $6.77 w/tax). It's a cross between a panini and a quesadilla actually, I think it's more of a quesadilla than a panini.It tastes like a sloppy joe with a Tex-Mex twist. It contains (possibly cheddar), chopped bell peppers, and onions. has a lot of ground beef, some cheese. It tasted like there's salsa and a bit too salty. Also as Kim pointed out, there's a \"weird aftertaste.\" As I tasted it again and paid attention to it, it had a warm, spicy, somewhat smoky flavor that lingers on the tongue. My analysis: too much cumin. Really, it just stays on your tongue for a while. Not my absolute favorite sandwich, panini, what have you but it's not bad either. If I rate it from a scale from 1-10, I give it a 6.For dessert, we went up a block to 7th Ave & 58th St to Le Pain Quotidien. I wanted to go to this place because it's one of the recommendations from my favorite food forum, Chowhound.com, suggested to me when I asked, \"where can I find the best brownie?\" So, when entering this bakery/café, they had a beautiful display of pastries and it just makes us both salivating for them. But the most appealing was the Belgian Brownie and we bought that for $3 (no tax) to take out. The setting to eat our brownie was in Central Park. It's been a while since both of us has been here (about 3-5 months) so, it's a nice change of setting. Hence the greenery in the photo.It looks so delicious! Actually, it looks like a chocolate souffle from the fallen, crackly crust on top. The interior looks moist, dense and fudge; my type of brownie! It smelled of good dark chocolate. The taste: it wasn't very sweet (a very good thing when you eat a dessert), chocolatey, a slight hint of almond flavor. It's one of the best brownies I have eaten in NYC. Then, it's concert time at Carnegie Hall.

A Quick Lunch at Bouchon Bakery

Today, I went to Bouchon Bakery because I had no patience waiting on line at Whole Foods that stretched down from their line to the registers down to their coffee bar. No way, I'm not that desperate like I was for the free Met Opera tickets. Also, the fact that I have a cold and under medication, standing still is not in my best interest. I just hope my nose and tastebuds still function properly...So, onto the food. I've orderded a small coffee ($1.80), a CB&J sandwich ($6.25) and a Nutter Butter cookie ($2.75). The total, including tax, was $12.30. Yeah, it's not a cheap lunch (also it was take out) but I have to eat something quick since I have 1/2 hour 'til class starts and I'm not in the mood for street cart food.The organic, fair trade coffee is and so far, smooth and bold. The way I like it, with a touch of skim milk, no sugar. The CB&J is a cashew butter and apricot jelly sandwiched between 2 slices of toasted brioche. This is an \"gourmet\" version of a typical American childhood sandwich, the PB&J. It's pretty good; the bread has a great golden brown hue, crunchy and it's buttered and lightly salted. The cashew butter is very rich and perfectly roasted and the apricot jam is a nice tart contrast, that is subtle yet slightly sweet.The Nutter Butter cookie is my favorite cookie from Bouchon Bakery. However, the cookie I gotten was actually, *gasp* refrigerated! It was cold and soggy; a major disappointment from a place that has supposed to have high standards. Shame on you Thomas Keller. For paying $2.75 for this cookie, it should've been fresh, not made way in advance! It still tasted fine but it lacked the crisp, nutty, chewiness that I have had from previous tries from this cookie.The good news is that my palette is still functioning but I am truly disappointed about the darn cookie.

Belated food blog: Tuesday, 9/19

The past Tuesday, 9/19, I ventured out to Chinatown. The heartland of all things cheap in Manhattan and have real Chinese food; not those Americanized food like sesame chicken. Of course, some restaurants cater to the tourists of the city and do carry the Americanized foods but that's not what I seek in Chinatown. The place of choice I went to is the Chatham Restaurant on 9 Chatham Square. This place is basically a dim sum place but more \"rustic.\" Not exactly, as you will see from the photo, a fancy restaurant.This place is pretty well known in my family, since my dad recalled to his teenage years (during the late 1960s, early 70s) eating their baked roast pork buns. About ten years ago, he finally took the entire family there and actually bought the well fabled buns. It was wonderful. I wasn't too aware of what was in it because I wasn't a \"foodie\" (meaning, I didn't care what or how it's made) yet but all I remembered was that it was pretty damn good.Back to the recent days. Well, I went there on my own and actually spoke Cantonese (most of my friends deny the fact that I had some knowledge of it), ordering a dai bao (literally translated, big bun) and the baked roast pork bun. The total cost was $1.70; the potk bun is 60 cents, the \"big bun\" is $1.10. Trust me, even though I didn't order many items, it will fill you up if you're not a big eater. Also, it's a lot cheaper than spending $6 and up, plus tax for a sandwich from Whole Foods or the local deli.The roast pork bun really has no comparison to any pork bun in NYC. The glossy, golden brown exterior is soft, sweet and a slight hint of a yeasty flavor that one would find in fresh bread. The inside contains a ton of chopped, lean roast pork meat, chopped onions and the right amount of sauce. It has a salty, peppery taste from the sauce. Very good - I know why I loved this thing. It kicks the Flushing version's ass - practically no pork at all, just pork fat, onions, and bland gelatinous sauce.Dai Bao: It's called that because it is a big bun. It's a steamed bun filled with a ton of ground pork, hard boiled egg, shrimp, chicken, and sometimes shitake mushrooms. Basically, it's a bun that's filled with the \"kitchen sink\" worth of meats or protein. You will not see or find any vegetables at all. This is a bun for a carnivore. There's no such thing as a \"big bun\" for vegetarians, unless it's Americanized. Anyways, it's really filling and hearty from all that protein and it's the traditional version of the bun.I shared both of these buns amongst my lunch companions, Helen and Seungmi. When I asked them which they prefer, I got mixed reactions. Helen loved the hearty meatiness of the \"big bun\" while Seungmi enjoyed the wonderful flavors of the pork bun. Personally, I loved the pork bun more because of the flavors and textures and the fact that I ate this since I was a kid. The \"big bun\" is just meant for sustenance for me.

You are CORRECT.. these are the best Pork Buns in the City... I have not been able to find any that can compare... With your command of the language... were you able to or could you obtain the recipe - for the baked buns?

Ever since I've joined John Jay's Student Government, life's been too hectic to try to write my food blog unless I make a time for it. Fortunately, today's Thursday and it's usually my time to catch up with anything I've missed or work that needed to be done that I have procrastinated. So, on to the food; technically, sweets!The last thing I've recorded on my food journal (yes, I have a food journal, not for dietary reasons; it's more like my memories of what, when, where, and how that food tasted like than calorie/fat count) that I haven't published yet was my cookie tastings. The first place I've went to was Bouchon Bakery in Columbus Circle. Just 3 blocks from school.So, as you can see I really splurged the money and calories that day. The total tab wasAs you can see they look pretty darn good...they're not cheap either. All the cookies cost $2.75 a piece. So, yeah it was a stressful day and I needed the caffeine (from the large coffee), chocolate, sugar kick. The chocolate chunk cookie was sublime! It was crisp on the edges, soft, buttery but not greasy, and the bittersweet Valhrona chocolate just shines through...one of the best ccc in New York City.The TKO cookie is a refined version of the Oreo cookie; without all those artificial flavors and preservatives...yuck. Anyways, this cookie is made of a chocolate shortbread sandwich with a rich white chocolate ganache. Once again, the chocolate is from Valhrona and a lot of butter. It's really rich and yummy but not my personal fave.My real favorite from this place is their Nutter Butter cookie (I didn't eat it that day, I had it a few times for the past few months). My god that cookie blew my mind! I had peanut butter cookies before, but this one really is nostagic and really delicious. If you love peanut butter cookies; you never had one 'til you tried this!Ok, back to the topic. The next place is Jacques Torres' Chocolate Haven in SoHo, on Hudson & King St. I went there a week later, Monday, 9/18. Those of you who are familiar with this place that's great, but I think you tried his ccc, the brownie, or the most recent addition from the summer: the cookie sandwich$10. Yep, the ccc and brownie was $2.50 each and the ice cream sandwich was $5. Even though the ice cream sandwich labeled espresso, there were other flavors like raspberry and banana. The fruit flavors aren't calling my name. I love the flavors of coffee/espresso with chocolate; something about the bitterness of coffee/espresso complements the chocolate.So, the first thing I tried was the ice cream sandwich. Holy cow! This is the BEST ice cream sanswich I have ever tasted my entire life! Or what Ed Levine (NY Times food critic) said on his blog, \"I have found the ice cream sandwich of my dreams.\" Soo true. The chocolate chip cookies are crisp, and chocolatey; not chewy or soggy that you would expect from an ice cream sandwich from your grocery store or what typically happens when it's made in advance. The espresso ice cream has the robust flavor of espresso but the texture of the ice cream is not that creamy. The texture's actually in between the creaminess of an ice cream and a sorbet. A tiny flaw but it can be overlooked. I really love this ics, but I was starting to get really full though. This thing is huge; 4 inches in diameter, 2 inches high.The next thing I ate was the chocolate chunk cookie. It was extremely chocolatey, crisp on the edges, pliant, soft and chewy on the middle, and buttery.The final thing, the brownie. This would be a chocoholic's dream. Dense, chocolatey brownie with a chocolate ganache on top. The walnut's crunchy bitterness was a nice contrast to the sweet, soft, chewiness of the brownie. My complaint is that the brownie is not fudgy enough. It's a little too cakey for me and probably a little too sweet. It's good but not my \"perfect\" brownie and I'm still searching for one.After eating all of those 3 things, I needed a huge glass of water and a couple of miles to walk it off. Thankfully, Manhattan is a walkable city.I should note that Jacques Torres also sell cupcakes. I haven't tried it but it looks adorable and it cost $2.50. In the city where cupcakes are all the rage for the past few years, my favorite so far (after trying so many for that duration of time) is from Sugar Sweet Sunshine in the Lower East Side on Rivington St. But that's a whole 'nother topic.

Roll & DoughThe chicken bun looked appetizing; it had a nice shiny glaze and a beautiful golden brown color on the bread. After breaking it up in half with my hands, the bread is very soft, the glaze is actually a sugar/honey mixture (it's a little sticky and tasted sweet) and slightly warm. The filling consisted of chunks of chicken (mostly dark meat, I think), scallion, and a certain gravy or brown sauce (thinking: soy sauce, a touch of oyster sauce and bound together with a cornstarch slurry). The problem is that there is a higher ratio of bread than filling. The taste, as a whole, is satisfactory. The soft, sweetness of the bread does counteract the salty, pepperiness of the filling but it's not harmonious enough to my palate to say that it's a great bun. But I have to say it's way better than what I get from Flushing these days.The pork and chive bing. Well, I had high expectations to have my mind blown off from this bing since everyone I read have said this is good stuff. I guess from this mind set, I thought it was very good, but not epiphany good. The crunchy exterior and the nutty flavor of the toasted sesame seeds goes very well with the salty (in a good way) pork & chive filling. The filling has a nice oniony flavor from the chives and a hint of garlic flavor. I really like it. If I ever eat here again (which will be likely) I will stick with their bings - which is what they're known for.

Union Square, Tisserie...again & c.c.c. (orig. posted 9/6/06)

I've went to Union Square twice today. Yeah, twice. The first time I was deprived of energy that I had enough time to go down there and hope to get a cup of coffee from my favorite joint, Joe. Unfortunately, it was 6:50 AM and they don't work the same hours as Starbucks, so it was a lost cause.Anyways, after suffering without coffee until 11 AM, I practically sprinted out of class, to the subways and down back to Union Square. A 20 minute commute (those of you who don't know where John Jay is, it's at 10th Ave and W 58th St.), that took a chunk off my lunch time. I chose to eat at Tisserie, yes again.I wanted to try a different flavor of quiche. So, I ended up choosing the salmon quiche ($5) and out of spontaneity, a chocolate chip cookie ($1.50), ending up costing $7.06 with tax.Well, obviously I ate my entreé, the salmon quiche. It contained a ton of cured salmon, eggs, bits of green bell pepper, possibly scallions (aka green onions), slices of potatoes, and a certain cheese (possibly gruyere from the creaminess and the pronounced sharp quality). At the first bite, I thought, \"Holy cow! That was salty!\" They should've had the forethought that the cured salmon has a substantial amount of salt in the first place and be more prudent to add any more salt to the egg mixture. The crust was good; a slight buttery taste and has crumbly texture. If they had added a lot less salt, I would've enjoyed this quiche.The chocolate chip cookie (from now on, I'll refer it as ccc) looked sad compared to the pastries on display. I didn't realized that until I sat down and looked at it. Well, I paid for it and I will eat it. I just hoped that it doesn't taste as bad as it looks. lol. The cookie was soft and had a cakey texture, which what I don't seek in a ccc; it doesn't have much chocolate chips (not the greatest chocolate I ever tasted) per bite. It had a slight hint of almond extract flavor and a bit of brown sugar flavor. The only good thing was that it's not greasy. Obviously, I was not too hot with this cookie.My ideal ccc would be what Ed Levine (one of the food critics of the NY Times) stated in his blog, it should be \"moist and light, crisp and yet slightly chewy, even pliant. There should be enough high quality chocolate in the cookie so that you get some chocolate in every bite. I don't want any chocolateless bites when I eat a chocolate chip cookie. They should be buttery without being greasy.\" So, it's still a search and this would be another topic for this blog.Anywhoo, I washed all of this food down with what I wanted and needed this morning, Joe's coffee...my savior for the day. Then I dashed back to the subway and to my next class...history.

Well, if you have read my previous post about Cafe Zaiya, it seemed I was standing in between the boundaries of like and dislike. Today I try confirmed my final thoughts on this much raved Japanese spot. Today, Tuesday, 9/5/06, I purchased the Mini Koshi An Pans (package of 5 for $2.75) and the Pork Cutlet Sandwich ($3.95 for 1 1/2 sandwiches; seen in photo). Both foods were made the day of and it looked appetizing; the problem is that this is a lot of food for me. Thankfully, I have arranged a little meet up for lunch with my long time high school & college friend, Seungmi ^^.Ok, back to the food. Let's start with the main course, the pork cutlet sandwich. It was pre-made but it was fresh enough that it had steam/condensation on the top of the package; it looks promising. The sandwich itself consists of plain white bread (no crust), shredded lettuce, slices of tomatoes, breaded (possibly fried?) pork chop, and it's dressed with worcestershire sauce. Looks good (as you can tell from the photo) but it smells acidic, most likely from that worcestershire sauce. The big part of food, the taste & texture. Well, the pork was cooked perfectly, not too dry, slightly moist. The bread is soft and moist due to the sauce as well as the fact it has been 1 1/2 hours since I bought it. The major drawback about this sandwich was that it lacked flavor. You barely detect a hint of pork flavor, the worcestershire sauce was too overbearing for this sandwich. Too bad.The next thing is well, dessert. It's not chocolate but I need some variety in life. So, the koshi an pans were cute, pettite buns that is filled with red bean paste. It looked good from the packaging; the desirable golden brown hue that you would like to have for any type of bread. The other reason why I bought this type of bun or bread is that I happen to like red bean paste buns from Flushing, Queens; assuming that it would taste the same or similar. The first time I tried it, I shared one with a visiting friend, Bryan, who commented/contemplated on whether or not he likes red bean paste. I can see why he would mull over this matter (more on that later). Initially, I thought it tasted okay. The textures were fine, soft bread with smooth paste. However, eating it a few more times with my lunch companion, Seungmi, I started to dislike it. There's not enough red bean flavor in the darn paste! All I can taste is the subtle yeasty flavor of the bread and the slight sweetness of sugar from the bean paste but there's an absence of red bean flavor. I am truly disappointed.Overall, I believe the purpose of Cafe Zaiya is to provide sustenance to the hungry Midtown lunch crowd who is on a budget and seek an accessible type of Japanese food. I really want to like their food but somehow I feel like I'm setting myself up for disappointment. The only thing I really loved eating from here was the mochi-an donut.To go back on the Bryan's contemplation on red bean paste, it's usually a hit-or-miss kind of thing. Certain brands that make the bean paste or whoever is making this batch can get perfection, blandness, or just plain disgusting. I too, have this conundrum when it comes to these things. The only time I truly ever loved red bean paste was the time my parents made it from scratch 5 years ago. Slaving over a big wok of red adzuki beans, for about 2 hours...and was it worth it. It was truly divine and blissful. Unfortunately, with modern times, we all somehow feel time restricted so we never do that anymore. Even though I still dream of it...

Ok, this blog be about, as indicated for the title, food. Most people, who known me for quite some time, know that I love food. So, this is going to be a little blog of the most recent places I have eaten around.For the past few days (Thursday & Fri), I have been eating the food from Cafe Zaiya, a small Japanese cafe located in Midtown East, on E 41st St between Madison & 5th Ave. This place serves inexpensive food like sushi, bento boxes, sandwiches, Japanese baked goods, and Beard Papa cream puffs. Seating is limited and it's really crowded during the afternoon.On Thursday, I have tried their grilled ham & cheese sandwich ($1.75). I bought this during the morning since I was time restricted and it looked good. When I actually got a good look at it when I ate it for lunch with a few of my friends. It was a half sandwich, made of thickly sliced whtie bread (about 1″ thick), filled with a tomato sauce, cheese and some chopped ham. Obviously from the size, my mouth cannot open that wide to fit that sandwich; so I ate it open face. I actually found out that the cheese was not melted, it's just shredded, and there were some slices of tomato and peppers. When I actually ate it, it was different than what I would perceive as a \"grilled ham and cheese sandwich.\" The bread was dry, the filling itself tasted like salsa. The cheese was almost indistinguishable from the taste and the ham's flavor just comes out slightly. I don't really like this sandwich but it's not awful. I guess my palate is more Americanized or I just set myself up for what would be the American version of the grilled ham & cheese.Yesterday (Friday), I tried their pastries; the Mochi-An donut ($1.50) and a white or green bean pastry (I forgotten the actual name, cost $1.20). They're both pretty substantial as a snack, about 3 inches in diameter. The first one I ate was the white bean pastry. The exterior crust had a pale white, cream color. The interior had a very pale, translucent green bean paste (think of the color of the leaf of an iceberg lettuce). I thought it tasted bland. I don't really like it even though I really wanted to like it.The mochi-an donut is a misnomer. It looked similar to the previous pastry; it's not fried and there is no hole, in what you would expect in a donut. The only difference is that the crust has a coating of sanding sugar (those of you who don't know what that is, think pretzel salt but opaque white in color) and it's a bit flakier. The interior has the sweet, red adzuki bean paste. This \"donut\" is really good. The sweetness of both the crust and the bean paste worked harmoniously well together. The only problem that it's a mess eating it. You get sugared on your clothes.Another spot I also ate yesterday, was Tisserie in Union Square; located on Broadway & 17th St. This place is a Venezuelan pastry shop but it serves European based goods with a Latin twist and they also sell savory foods as well. This is technically the second time I ate here. The first time I tried their mini Tiger cake and financier ($1.50 each) with a friend who ordered this and a quiche ($5).The quiche was quite tasty and they give you a pretty large slice, too. The crust was flaky and the filling was good; it had a cheesy flavor, probably goat cheese or some type of soft cheese. The tiger cake is an oval shaped butter cake with chocolate flecks in it and the center was concave, filled with chocolate ganache. It was good; it had a almondy taste and the ganache was dark chocolate, which I really like. The complaint from my companion was that it was too greasy. The almond financier, a French butter pound cake that is small and rectangular; the way it's supposed to be. It's not bad but I don't taste anything nutty and it's not as greasy as the tiger cake. I should mention that their coffee was actually good.Today, I ate the turkey and cream cheese croissant ($3.50) and a small coffee ($2.50). I found out that their coffee is actually organic and fair-trade, so I'm helping out the coffee farmers out there and the environment. It still tastes good, bold and robust, not bitter. The croissant is somewhat, what I would call, a grease bomb. The paper bag that held my croissant had a grease stain (medium sized), holding it for a minute. I think it's mainly from the cream cheese. Anyways, the croissant had the right shade of golden brown and it was flaky to the bite. The interior is what is the name stated, turkey and cream cheese. To my disappointment, the turkey is something in what you would find from a deli or prepackaged turkey from a supermarket. But overall, it's pretty tasty. I guess from the butter from the croissant and fat from the cream cheese made it all palate appealing.Unfortunately, I don't have any photos of the foods yet. But I'm working on remembering to bring my camera and take photos of my food with my phone.

I used to go to that Cafe Zaiya all the time when I worked near there. Those little premade sandwiches at lunch are cheap and, if not huge or spectacularly tasty, well put together. As in not messy bricks of food that you can't fit in your mouth. (The lunch sandwiches, that is -- I've never had the grilled ham and cheese in the mornings, like you did.)

I do agree that Cafe Zaiya is very affordable. I love their desserts more than their sandwiches though.

Who Has the Best Scones in NYC?

I'm really going with the whole theme of \"who's got the best of...(some type of food)?\" Can't help it really. If I'm craving for a certain type of food heck, I'll search the ends of New York City, to get it and possibly pay for that certain price tag. So, it's all about scones today.I love a good scone, especially the ones just out the oven, I would be in heaven. Unfortunately, the academic life restricts my schedule from actually bake scones and amongst a ton of other things. Seriously, I'm in dire need to bake just to take out the stress of life. Anyways, those of you who don't really know what a scone is, it's a Scottish quick bread is said to have taken its name from the Stone of Destiny (or Scone), the place where Scottish kings were once crowned. They come in various shapes including triangles, rounds, squares and diamonds. Scones can be savory or sweet and are usually eaten for breakfast or tea (from Foodtv.com). If you still haven't gotten the idea of what the heck a scone is, think of American biscuits that could have different flavor variations, either sweet or savory. Got it now? Good.Since I can't bake, I buy and hope to search for a good or possibly great scone. I tried bakeries to the organic bakers who are part of the Union Square Greenmarket. Not suprisingly, I've eaten the good and the ugly.My ideal scone would have a beautiful, golden brown exterior that is slightly crisp or crunchy and a soft, flaky slightly moist center. I don't really care what flavor the scone is. It can be sweet or savory, as long as the flavors don't overpower the scone or the other flavorings - I seek balance and contrast in textures and flavors. So, onto the scones!The rating system will go from 1-4 (Same as the croissants).1: It sucks2: Not bad, not good either3: Good4: It's divine!I'll begin with Financier Patisserie's fruit & nut scone. It looks like a traditional scone, the type that one would roll out a large thick sheet of scone dough and cut it out with a cookie cutter. It's glazed with heavy cream by the sheen and that's the traditional way of baking a scone. It has a nice golden brown color and it looks like there's a good bit of raisins too.The interior is moist, good crumb composition, and a good amount of raisins and almond slivers. There's a slight hint of almond flavor which makes this scone a bit appealing to my tastebuds also it's not too sweet. It's good, not spectacularly great. Rating: 3 out of 4.Joyce's Bakeshop's cherry chocolate scone ($2.50) has a good amount of miniature chocolate chips dotted on the surface. The scone is a lot drier than Financier's. It actually has the dry, crumbly texture of a shortbread than a scone. It does have chocolate flavor but it's mediocre chocolate. There are a couple of chopped dried cherries, as seen in the photo, but I don't really taste them. I think they should use dried tart cherries than bings so the cherry flavor could shine through instead of being virtually nonexistent in the taste, but at least it has good butter flavor and it's not too sweet. Rating: 2.75 out of 4.Balthazar Bakery's pumpkin-fruit scone ($2.50); the name explains the yellow-orange hue to the scone and it's sugar crusted. There's dried raisins and cherries in it, the latter was kind of unexpected to me since I ususally assumed that they would just have raisins but the more (fruits), the merrier. The texture is more biscuit/scone-like: Crisp exterior, soft, somewhat moist, interior. It has a great pumpkin flavor that isn't overpowered by the cloves or nutmeg but I can taste the presence of the spices. It's a good balance of sweet and spice. Rating: 3.1 out of 4.This pumpkin and raisin scone is from Our Daily Bread, one of those baked goods stands from the Union Square Greenmarket. The scone looks humble and simple with a sugar crust and lots of raisins dotted throughout the scone. The exterior crust is crisp and crunchy from the sugar crust. It has a good pumpkin flavor with a nice spicy background from the spices; not overpowering. The interior is moist but not mushy with lots of green raisins in the scone. Rating: 3 out of 4.Another Greenmarket stand, Bread Alone's cranberry scone ($1.75) looks visually appealing, comparing to it's competition/peer, Our Daily Bread. It has a more desirable golden brown exterior with the bright red color from the cranberry's juices bursting while the scone baked in the oven. The crust was not as crisp as Our Daily's. The interior crumb was very moist - nearing mushy, and you can see the vast amount of cranberries dotted in the scone and a few walnuts. The major problem with this scone is that it is bland! No buttery flavor, no sweetness from the dough; the cranberry doesn't contribute much to the flavor either. The only thing I tasted in this scone was a hint of nuttiness from biting on the walnut and a nearly negligible sour-tartness from the cranberry. Not a good scone at all. I actually threw it out after two small bites from this thing. Rating: 1 out of 4</spa n>.Bouchon Bakery's plain scone ($2.50) had a nice sugary crust with a pale golden hue. It's not greasy and it had a nice crunch from the sugary exterior. I had high expectations for this scone just because it's from Bouchon. However, this scone is *gasp* nearly bland; it just has a weak butter flavor and somehow I tasted a faint, annoying raw flour aftertaste everytime I bite into it. Rating: 2.5 out of 4.Once Upon A Tart's apricot walnut scone ($2.50) does not look like a traditional scone at all. I didn't pay attention to how it looked since I just looked at the list of offerings available that day and I was surprised that it looks like a jumbo thumbprint cookie. After that intial shock of sorts, I started analyzing this scone. It was barely warm when I touched and ate this scone; about 8 AM. It has a nutty aroma due to the fact this scone was made of walnut flour and the apricot was the jam in the center. Not what I particularly had in mind either. I was actually thinking of a scone mixed with walnuts and chopped dried apricots. It had a slightly crisp exterior and a moist interior. The scone's nutty earthiness contrasted with the apricot's bright, sweet-tart flavor. It was unexpectedly good.Rating: 3.2 out of 4.Amy's Bread blueberry scone ($2.25) it's covered with lots of tiny blueberries, a golden brown hue with a sugar crust on top. It tastes as good as it looks. The scone was crunchy on the edges, sweet but not overly sweet, some buttery flavor, and a good amount of berries throughout the scone. To get a sense of what the texture of the scone looks like, take a look at its closeup. I like this scone a lot. Rating: 3.5 out of 4.Whole Foods's blueberry scone ($1.69). Yes, I tried their stuff, too. I did it out of impulse and my craving for scones. I didn't expect much from their scones just because it's a supermarket, not a bakery. It looked like it had a lot of blueberries from all of the blue-gray spotts throughout the surface of the scone and it had a golden brown exterior. Looks decent. But does it taste good? Well, not really. It's pretty much bland. I only could taste the tartness of the blueberries but there's no real oomph of blueberry flavor; just a hint of butter and a faint sweet cream flavor. Rating: 2.2 out of 4.Zabar's apricot scone ($1.60) looks a bit pallid for a scone. It looks disappointing. The scone is soft but only crisp on the edges. There's a good bit of apricots and a little bit of scattered in the scone. It has a slight nutty, almondy taste, no real apricot flavor found in this scone. It's not a good scone but at least their coffee's decent. Rating: 1.5 out of 4.Eli Zabar, not to get confused with Zabar, this is an expensive, upscale food store in the Upper East Side, not the Upper West.Eli Zabar's blueberry scone ($2.50) looked appetizing and it smelled like butter. Positive signs after eating so many mediocre scones. It had a sugar crust and just a vein of blueberry juice on the surface. I hoped that this blueberry scone had more than just a few blueberries. However, my hopes were dashed once I broke it apart. It just have those few veins and everything else was plain. At least it was slightly crisp on the outside and a soft, moist crumb. It tasted like a sweet, plain scone with a good butter flavor with a very etheral hint of vanilla. Not much of blueberry flavor to speak of, obviously after seeing that photo you can tell. Rating: 2.8 out of 4. It tastes good but it lacked the blueberries I paid for!So, the overall best list will be:1.

I love your \"Who Has the Best\" series.    Could you find the best muffins, cake doughnuts and rugelach please?  I haven't found a good muffin (yuck to Au Bon Pain, delis and street carts) until I went to Financier today.  I think it's the perfect size, too.  For dougnuts, Dunkin Donuts tastes unnatural, and I had an unimpressive cider doughnut from one of the farmer stands.

This post is AWESOME!  :)I really like Financier's scone.  My other favorites are from Levain Bakery and Alice's Teacup, but the tastiness depends a lot on the freshness.  Mraah!

jessica - Thanks for loving my \"Best of...\" series. Muffins are possibly one of my future blogs. I don't know about donuts but you can read Ed Levine's blog: http://www.edlevineeats.com/post/2001about donuts - especially from Donut Planet. Rugelach is hard to find; after trying a few brands from Zabar's and Fairway, I've been pretty disappointed but it's a task I'll try to take. I'm more of a babka girl than a rugelach.Robyn - I totally agree with you about the scone's tastiness depends on the freshness. But it also depends on their recipe some of them are just plain horrible (i.e. Bread Alone) I bought at 8 AM and it's just plain awful!

Hi Tina, I just saw Ed's post.  I'm not a fan of Doughnut Plant's raised doughnuts, but maybe I'll give the tres leches and Balthazar doughnut a try.About rugelach-darn, I heard Zabar's was good.  Sorry you had bad results.  I've also heard good things about Margaret Palca Bakes.  I saw some at Sahadi's in Brooklyn but didn't get them because they didn't have chocolate.I love babka too!  Ooh, what are your favorites?  Do you know why some are more bready and others are like danish?  What's the difference between babka and Russian coffee cake?  Zabar's sells both.
hellokitty893112
2006-11-05 21:31:00
Jessica - To tell you the truth, I don't know what's the difference between a babka and a Russian coffeecake. But I heard that there's different schools of babkas like Russian and Polish. Even though I'm a bit ignorant about Jewish and Eastern European food and desserts, I still do love both. My favorite brands are either Green's or Eli Zabar's, both of which I purchase from Zabar's once every two to three weeks.

I think Whole Foods has some of the greatest scones in california, I wonder if the chain has the same ones in NYC? the darker fruit nut scone is to die for, chunky heavy, crispy nutty with the right amount of carmaleized crisp edged rasins etc  with powdered sugar on top.. also the crystalized ginger scone is so great, with its candy-like icing, thick, crispy and wonderful contract it has out for the slight heat of the great organic crystallized ginger.  I also love the white flour fruit and nut scone. without icing.  all great.  i did not like the Blueberry here at all, a total overly sweet damp drag.  but the fore-mentioned have nothing in common.  try em all, and get a homemade fig bar for later...mmmm

Went to Alice's Tea Cup and seriously, my pumpkin scone was AMAZING.  Best scone I ever tasted in my life.  Realized that I've been missing out.

Yup, that's the name of the bakery/cafe that is located in 135 Sullivan Street (near Houston St) in SoHo. I've been to this adorable bakery a few times for the past couple of years. Mostly pastries, they did have good madelines and biscottis. Well, after sifting through their own cookbook again in Strands Books, made me want to come back to this place. (I know the photo isn't balanced and all, but I was in a hurry. Sorry.).The foods I've tried were their walnut apricot scone ($2.25), pumpkin cranberry biscotti ($1), a spinach mushroom tart ($5.50) and an iced tea ($2.25).In case you're wondering, no I did not eat all of this in one sitting. This is my breakfast (I ate in there: scone, biscotti and iced tea were my breakfast) and lunch (in Queens, with a friend: the tart).When I ordered the scone, I just read the sign that had all the available offerings of scone, so when I read \"Walnut apricot scone,\" I didn't expect to see that. I thought it was a huge cookie when they had it on display. I had a different image in mind. Oh well. The scone really looks like a huge thumbprint cookie. What I had in mind was a scone with chunks of walnuts and dried apricots. This scone is actually made of walnut flour and apricot jam. That's a mild surprise to me. Well, the good part was that the scone was still warm when I tried to break the scone in half to get a photo of the interior. It tasted pretty good. The walnut flour gave it a earthy, nutty, and a slight bitter flavor, since it is a walnut. The apricot jam gives it a nice, sweet and tart contrast to the nutty flavor of the scone itself. It very good but it's not traditional.The pumpkin cranberry biscotti was a flavor I had in mind since the coming of fall. Usually, I like to eat to seasonal or at least seasonal flavors. So, this particular flavor was calling me. Anyways, this biscotti is really chunky, as you can see, filled with lots of dried cranberries, walnuts, and pumpkin seeds. The biscotti had a rich pumpkin flavor from the spices of clove and nutmeg. The sharp tartness of the cranberries heightens the flavor of the pumpkin and the walnut and pumpkin seeds gives the cookie an earthy, crunchy flavor and texture. The biscotti was really crunchy, a good thing since biscotti means twice baked in Italian. I was really inspired to bake my cherry, white chocolate biscotti after eating this! Eh, unfortunately school doesn't really let me schedule that in. Probably, when I start going on my baking craze during the holidays, I'll bake again.The iced tea was decent. I kind of regret getting it since I really wanted to dunk my biscotti in coffee or espresso. The tea was fine though, it had a nuance of lemon zest flavor, as if it had lemon slices soaked in a few hours and strained off, so it had that bitterness of the lemon pith (the white stuff under the yellow skin of a lemon).The spinach mushroom tart. First of all when I met up with my friend, Seungmi, for lunch she asked me, \"What is it?\"I replied to her, \"It's a spinach mushroom tart.\"She said, \"Spinach?!\"I said, \"Yeah, what about it?\"Then it hit me (and she also told me), the spinach E.coli problem. But I remembered, after reading and taking so many years of biology, E.coli wouldn't be a problem if you washed and cooked your food properly. So, with this fact, it allieviated her issue with eating a piece of this tart.Oh, I should mention that this tart was actually refrigerated. So, that a huge drawback about this tart. I refused to microwave this tart, too because it would make this tart even softer than what it is. So, when I ate this tart it was thawed out a few hours from the morning. Probably the flavors of the tart that would be there when it's warm wouldn't shine through since I chose not to microwave it.The tart looked very green and I didn't see much of mushrooms when I cut it in there until it into a tiny bite. It was soft, obviously since I've explained earlier. The crust tasted bland; texturally, it's a little flaky. The spinach filling had a touch of eggy-creaminess, barely any mushrooms and it was still bland. It didn't taste so great, which is a bad thing for their namesake. It was decent at most.I would try their sweet dessert tarts, I just don't know about their savory, if it's still stored in the fridge. Well, at least I know I'll have a dependent bakery for homestyle desserts...

Macarons...who has them in NYC? Who's the best?

Macarons...I'm talking about the French style macarons, not those coconut mounds that it's spelled macaroons. Macarons are simple cookies, made from almond powder, sugar and egg whites, then sandwiched with a layer of flavored cream or jam.To my surprise (well, not really) that there aren't that many bakeries and shops that sell these yummy pastry delights in Manhattan or Brooklyn. Obviously, in Paris it's ubiquitous (after drooling after reading Robyn's multiple blogs about them on her stay in Paris; that's my original inspiration to this blog. Thank you, Robyn!). I guess the American palate doesn't like the delicate cookie and tend to like the simple in-your-face flavor and texture of a coconut macaroon that is very common here.My goal (one of my many food goals actually) for the past two weeks to find the most shops or bakeries that sells French style macarons. Unfortunately, one of the bakeries that did sell macarons during it's opening months (about half a year ago) no longer sells them. I will talk more about it later on. In conjunction with that, I want to know who's worth buying them. These little, or big if you prefer, pastries are not cheap. Usually they run on average $2 a pop (for the little guys) in Manhattan. Also, at a certain bakery/shop, one of the macaron flavors stand out as the best ones out of the group. Odd isn't it?My criteria of a good macaron should have a light, thin crust that gives way to a soft, chewy cookie that is also light and airy. The filling should have the same flavor as the cookie, should be thick but not pasty, and should offer an obvious contrast to the texture of the cookie.The rating system will be the same as my croissant rating: 1 (It sucks) to 4 (Divine).Ok, I'm starting with my small astonishment. Those of you who went to Bouley Bakery & Market in TriBeca a few months ago, knew that they sell macarons. Well, now they don't! I went there on Tuesday, 10/17 around 1 PM, hoping to get some of their macarons. I've tried it once during their opening months and if my memory serves me well, I remembered it was quite good and that they have more exotic flavors like passionfruit. When I asked one of the employees, \"Do you still sell macarons?\" The employee gave me that expression on his face saying \"What the hell is that girl talking about?\" He actually replied to me saying, \"No, we don't. Sorry.\" Needless to say, that ruined my trip down there. I don't usually trek down to TriBeca unless I have a craving for some of their other baked goods and pastries, which is quite rare.Recovering slowly from my disappointing shock, I proceeded on to Financier Patisserie Wall Street, the original branch in 62 Stone Street. I bought a pack of 8 mini-macaron ins for $7. It's one of the cheapest out the bunch I've tried, about 88 cents a piece. Anyways, each macaron actually stood up to my criteria, aforementioned in the beginning. Overall, they're good. All of the macarons have the crisp, thin outer shell and the moist interior. But each flavor did have it's own little nuance that I'd took note.Starting with the chocolate, it has a good dark chocolate ganache, about 60-70% cocoa and it's not very sweet. It's very good. Rating: 3 out of 4.I find the raspberry macaron too sweet, actually it's sweeter than the chocolate macaron. Probably the raspberry jam filling has too much sugar in the recipe. Rating: 2.5 out of 4.The lemon was very good; it had a good balance of the sweet-sour flavor of the lemon with a nice tang effervescence that lingers on your tongue after eating it. It's quite memorable. Rating: 3.2 out of 4.The lemon-coconut was my favorite out of the bunch. It had a nice, nutty flavor and the texture of the coconut flakes made it really interesting. The same lemon filling or curd from the lemon macaron was used here and it worked wonderfully together. The contrast of the earth, nutty flavor of the coconut cookie to the bright, sweet-tart lemon filling. This little macaron spoke volumes to my tongue... Rating: 3.75 out of 4.The pistachio was good, it had a nice pistachio flavor and the cream's texture was spot on but nothing great about it. Rating: 2.75 out of 4.Overall rating for the macarons (not averaging the individual scores): 3 out of 4.Bouchon Bakery, I know those of you who read my blogs, I praise most of their stuff and had my issues with them too. When it comes to the macarons, it's not bad at all.The pumpkin macaron. Yes, I have published a blog about this earlier but it's part of my purpose here. It's different than most of the macarons I've ever encountered since pumpkin, I usually think, is American than a French flavor, so I tip my hat off to Chef Keller for creating this flavor. If you can recall what I've said in the earlier posting, I've said this macaron is freaking good! A thin, crisp shell with a moist interior; a great pumpkim flavor that is not overwhelmed by cloves and nutmeg. Just a perfect zen of a macaron, nothing overpowers the other. Rating: 3.5 out of 4.When I tried their other flavors: coffee, and green apple (they did have chocolate, vanilla, and caramel as the other options but I didn't have a hankering for them), it's not as great as the pumpkin. I think it's just because they're just regular flavors and the pumpkin epiphany was still fresh on my mind. But they're all good.Joyce Bakeshop at 646 Vanderbilt Ave Park (between Park Pl and Prospect Pl) Slope, Brooklyn. It's a new bakery that had opened for two, nearly three months. It's charming, the people there are nice especially the fact that it was 8:30 in the morning when I visited there. They have great coffee from Gorilla, which is a local coffee purveyor on 5th Ave. in Brooklyn. Anyways, amongst the many things I've bought that day, I had their hazenut and chocolate macarons for 50 cents each. Yes, it's pretty darn cheap and they're dainty.Their hazelut macaron, pictured above and on the right, is quite soft. There's no thin, crisp shell; it's just all soft, chewiness throughout the cookie. It tasted a little too sweet for me but it had a nice hazelnut flavor. Rating: 2.5 out of 4.The chocolate macaron had the same texture for as the hazelnut; soft and chewy throughout. It's still a little too sweet but it has a nice semi-sweet chocolate filling (50-60% cocoa).La Maison du Chocolat, I visited the Rockefeller Center location for these macarons. It's the same macarons in the beginning of this post but arranged differently. These are the small macarons for $2 each. The only available flavors (and what I bought) are vanilla (the foreground), chocolate, caramel, and lemon (the one in the back).The vanilla macaron is sweet (a little too sweet), chewy, and light. I'm not detecting the crispness of the exterior shell but it has lots of vanilla bean flecks throughout the macaron. Rating: 2.8 out of 4.The chocolate macaron...I had high expectations for this macaron in particular because this is a high-end chocolate place and I love their chocolate. Unfortunately, I set my self to a little bit of disappointment. The macaron is still soft, not much of a crisp exterior but it's still delicate, light and moist in the center. The good thing is that their chocolate ganache is excellent; great dark, bittersweet chocolate (about 72-78%). Rating 3.1 out of 4.Caramel is a sweet macaron, obviously from the name, but it's not too sweet. I detected a hint of the burnt, somewhat bitter, sugar flavor as I let the macaron filling linger on my tongue for a few seconds. It gives the macaron an interesting, complex element to the flavor of the macaron. It's still the same texture as the other macarons: light, soft, no real crisp shell. Rating: 3 out of 4.The lemon has the most crisp exterior (finally!) out of the group. It had a nice, sweet tartness from the lemon filling and a moist interior. It's my favorite from La Maison...a shocker! Rating: 3.5 out of 4.Overall rating for macarons: 3.2 out of 4.The last place I went to was Fauchon, a Parisian company that sells high end chocolate, pastries, tea, pate de fruit, marzipans that looks like the actual fruit, and lots of other stuff. Anyways, the macarons were limited in flavor options when I visited there yesterday around 9:30 AM. All they had were the chocolate, pistachio, lemon, and raspberry; for both the small and large sizes. I bought the small ones for $2.25 each.The first one I ate was the chocolate. It had a nice thin, crisp outer shell, moist interior and the chocolate ganache is dark chocolate, about 72% cocoa. Yummy... Rating: 3.2 out of 4.The raspberry had the same textures as the chocolate, the rasberry jam/filling had a good balance of sweet and tart. Rating: 3 out of 4.The pistachio has the same texture characteristics: thin crisp outer shell, moist interior. The pistachio cream is pretty tasty with good pistachio flavor. Rating: 3 out of 4.</span >The lemon macaron has the same great characteristics of a good macaron as the others from Fauchon. It has a nice, bright tartness from the lemon filling/curd but nothing extraordinary out of this particular macaron. Rating: 3 out of 4.Overall rating: 3.2 out of 4.I know there's Payard macarons that I should've tried and I'm kicking myself for not going there but I didn't have the time. To tell you honestly, I don't have a favorite macaron place. None of these places are not mind-blowingly great. I yearn to go to Paris and pig out eating their macarons. But if I have to choose one, it would be a coin toss between Fauchon and La Maison du Chocolat for consistently good macarons. I can't say much for Payard but I know it should be decent or good from what I've read.

Whoa, you are so awesome.  I must bow down...[bow]  I'm so glad I could influence you, hehe...uh...am I a good influence?  ;)One of my friends told me about Bouley's lack of macarons.  Doh!  That's so sad!  WHY WOULD THEY DO THAT?!?!?!I haven't been to Payard either!  Shall do that when I go back.  ;)

Robyn - Yes, you're blog sometimes inspire me to search for stuff in the city. Sometimes it scares me how much macarons you consume too. hehehe...Anyways, I still love your blog.I think Bouley took off the macarons probably because it's not popular, that they're not selling enough. I was and still am devastated that they don't sell them anymore. A HUGE bummer.I'm want to try to Payard's macarons soon. I've tried their little chocolate cakes that are glossed with shiny chocolate ganache that are works of art a few years ago...let's just say after I ate them, I lost all sense of direction and place. It was quite good.

Ok. I've had Fauchon macarons. I've had the ones at Payard. Nothing-NOTHING-compares to what I just put into my mouth 5 minutes ago. The holy grail of macarons in this town has got to be the pumpkin macaron I just ate from Bouchon Bakery (Time Warner Center). DELICIOUS DELICIOUS DELICIOUS.Not too sugary, perfectly firm on the outside, creamy in the middle, and whispering \"autumn\" with just the right touch of pumpkin. Perfection. In addition to pumpkin, they had green apple, espresso, chocolate, vanilla, and caramel. For $2.75 you get a larger macaron, and it's utterly worth it.I implore you to go before it's too late.

Andi - In case you haven't really read this blog, I have eaten the pumpkin macaron from Bouchon Bakery, amongst the many other flavors they have. Yes, I do find it tasty and it's pretty darn good for the price. But I find it discouraging that it's refrigerated; probably I should've left it out at room temp before eating it.

Hello!  I just discovered your blog and I'm mezmerized by your pictures!  If only I had the patience to photograph the meals I've had before just digging in like a madman.  hahaJust wanted to let you know that Bouley Bakery has macarons again.  (I was just there on 6/09/07, and they had 9 different flavors).  I'd stay away from the peach and safron one, I just didn't like it at all.

Today, I have no classes (obviously because it's Columbus Day), stayed home and studying for upcoming midterms. Anyways, over the weekend my parents decided to buy a frozen turkey and roast that darn thing on Sunday. It's not hard at all; just defrost the turkey the day before, marinate the bird overnight with a spice rub (did it the Chinese way by using Five Spice Powder, etc.). Roast it in 350 degree oven for 1 hr. 45 mins. and you got a great turkey. Since this is like a prelude to Thanksgiving for my family, as in the leftovers I have to be creative on the sandwich department.If you know me long enough, my entire family is pretty much foodies of sorts; make our own pasta/noodles, make our own stews and soups (my mom's specialty), baked goods/desserts (that's my forte), and roasted meats or meat cooked in any way (my dad's thing besides computers & techie stuff), my brother's specialty is eating them. lol. I know that's harsh to say about my brother, but he doesn't cook or bake, he's just the mathematician. But I still love him anyway.Since my parents gone out of the house to work, I was thinking of what to eat for lunch: something with turkey. So, I decided on a turkey sandwich with sautéed white button mushrooms and slice bell peppers with yesterday's turkey gravy; for my beverage: flowering tea that I've dug out of my kitchen cupboards. I can't believe I still have them! Those of you who are wondering what the tea looks like: The tea \"unbloomed\"Tea\" bloomed\"; isn't it pretty?Possibly, you're thinking, \"You're drinking tea out of a (Chardonnay) wine glass?!\" Yes, I do. For this particular tea, besides the asthetics, it also captures the floral fragrance of the tea; as you drink the tea, you inhale its scent. The way you drink wine.Since I'm at home, I've borrowed my dad's Canon EOS Rebel XT Camera to take pics of my food for today. I must say, I love this camera but kind of wish he had macro lens for the close up shots.As an appetizer, I had pan fried dumplings. It's homemade and from scratch, from skin to meat. My dad made these yesterday and had them frozen, so it can be cooked when you want them. It's filled with ground chicken, chives, napa cabbage, scallion and ginger. Pan fried 'til golden brown. It's pretty darn good, I'm still saying that almost 15 years of my life, ever since I'm able to know how food tastes like. The only drawback was that the filling was too moist due to the cabbage's water content. But it's still good.The main course, if you will, is my turkey sandwich I described earlier. On the side is my roasted potatoes with rosemary and garlic. The toasted Italian bread absorbs the gravy, making it moist and flavorful. The turkey, mushroom, gravy combo is traditional and the bell pepper gave the sandwich a tangy highlight to the earthy flavors of the mushroom and turkey. The potatoes compliment the the sandwich, as a healthier alternative to fries, plus it's more flavorful with the rosemary-garlic aroma that filled the house.It's a gratifying, hearty lunch even though the portions are on the small side.I'm full and now, I have to get back studying. It's a beautiful day, I'll walk outside later on, since the rest of the week is going to get cooler.

For the past two weeks, I've been searching for the best croissant. To tell you the truth, it's been a hardship for my arteries and my wallet. I practically ate 5 pounds of butter from all of those croissants! I could imagine that my cardiologist in the future, would love me. At least I'm young that I can lower my cholesterol and triglycerides. Also, I'm thinking of abstaining from croissants for a week. I should mention before we go into the critiques, what I consider a good or possibly a great croissant.A good croissant should be fresh (obviously), a nice golden brown color on the exterior, flaky, light, buttery but not greasy, it should have a good shatter effect (meaning, when you break apart or bite off the croissant, one can hear the crisp, brittle shattering noise from the flaky pastry), a moist, soft and chewy interior but it should not be weighed down from moisture content of butter or grease. On that note, to the list and critiques of croissants! (Of 7 establishments).The rating system will go from 1-4.1: It sucks2: Not bad, not good either3: Good4: It's divine!Bouley Bakery at 130 W Broadway (Duane St.) in TriBeca. I have tried three different croissants from this place: A banana chocolate, plain, and chocolate croissants.The banana chocolate croissant cost $3.50, I bought this the morning of 9/26 around 8 AM and by the time I've ingested this thing, it's around 12:30 PM. So, time was probably a problem of sorts when I actually analyzed the texture of this croissant. It looks good from this photo; the multiple strata promises for good shattering effect for a croissant and a nice golden exterior When I actually cut into the croissant it was actually a little soft, there was some flakiness but no shatter effect. That's why I'm thinking it was the time and humidity factor. The taste was good: it was banana-y and it had good dark chocolate. Just a bit disappointed in the texture. Rating of croissant: 2.5.The following croissants, plain and chocolate (total cost $5.65, I should've asked for an itemized receipt), are the ones I purchased yesterday, 10/5 around 9 AM. I was hoping that these croissants didn't share a similar fate to the banana chocolate. I took the photos, split them, took pics again then I shared it amongst my friends of NeVAS (St. John's art club, holla! lol.). The chocolate croissant croissant looks appetizing. A shiny, glazed, golden brown hue on the exterior. The side view show s the multiple strata of the pastry. I'm liking it so far from the looks of this. When you look at the interior shot it has the layers with great dark chocolate.It's flaky when I split it apart with my hands however, when a friend, Kim has tasted it, she has indicated that it is too greasy, which I have overlooked myself because I was so busy trying to take pics of other foods that I had with me. When I actually tried it myself, it is greasy - on the fingers, it's not greasy like a mushy, grease bomb of a croissant texturally on the pallate. So, it's not bad but Bouley had to use less of their Plugra butter. It has a great dark, bittersweet chocolate I'm tasting 72-75% Schokinag chocolate (a German chocolate company that Bouley does sell in their establishment). It's good, not what I would call great but it's certainly not bad at all. Rating of croissant: 3.The plain croissant looks good; shiny golden exterior. When I broke it apart, it was crisp, it flaked like crazy, and I heard a little bit of the shatter effect! The I was absolutely happy to see and here that for a croissant, so it brought great expectations to eating this pastry. The cavernous flaky interior, moist, but a little greasy. It had good butter flavor. Not great by my standards but it's good. Rating of croissant: 3.Overall, I would rate this place a 3. Cost/value-wise: 2.The next bakery would be City Bakery located near Union Square at 3 W 18th St. off of 5th Ave. I know I've promised Kim that I would go there with her but I've been here years before I've done this food blogging business and I will still glady go with her in the future. Anyways, I've went here twice, on 9/27 and on 10/2. The first visit I've ordered their pretzel croissant ($3.50). This croissant has its own cult of followers, if you ask anyone who's been a patron to this place they'll rave about the pretzel croissant. It has a great dark golden brown exterior and it looks somewhat of a pretzel because of the sesame seeds. When I pulled it apart, it was flaky, a bit crisp, a touch of grease on the fingers...not bad so a far. The interior is very soft, moist and buttery. It's salty like a pretzel but obviously it has the characteristics of a croissant. It's best when it's warm, unfortunately, I came in a bit late from the time it came out of their ovens around 11 AM. This is my favorite croissant from City Bakery. Croissant rating: 3.5.The other croissant I had was their chocolate croissant ($2.50) for breakfast on 10/2 around 9:30 AM. It's flaky, great color but lacking the shatter effect I'm looking for. It tasted good: the dark chocolate is on the 62% range, under 70% for sure; it buttery (not particularly greasy) and not very sweet. It's good, but I had better. Croissant rating: 2.8.The same day I had City Bakery's chocolate croissant, I went to Marquet Patisserie in Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn; located at 221 Court St. (Warren St). I've asked in my favorite food forum, Chowhound.com want to sit at their tables at the time, wandered around Brooklyn and just walked back to the subway station. I ate this croissant in City , for their recommendations for a good croissant in Brooklyn, since I want to expand my horizons of food in New York City. One of them replied and suggested this place. So in hopes for a good croissant, I arrived there around 8 AM. Their baked products looked good and I ordered their plain croissant which cost $1.50. I really didn'tBakery so you can arguably say the CB's chocolate croissant is my control of this experiment. However, I don't know if I should've done that since it's been about 1 1/2 hours since I've bought this croissant and it might have suffered the same fate as the banana croissant from Bouley. From the exterior, it looks fine, a golden brown hue and it looks flaky. When I pulled it apart, it was soft not crisp but it flaked a little. When I tasted it, a little bit of crunch on the teeth, the overall texture was soft a very slight crunch to the tooth. Come to think about it, the butter tasted off. I don't like this croissant that I can't finish it off after the second bite. Croissant rating: 1.5.Overall: 1.5. I know it's harsh, it can be my fault for waiting that long to eat it but I know the staleness should not be there in a croissant. I'm planning to give this place a second chance in the future and give it another whirl.Bouchon Bakery in 10 Columbus Circle (60th St.), on the 3rd floor of this behemoth of a high end mall. Those of you who have read my blogs, know that I've raved this place for their baked goods but I can't help it. Their stuff is just so good but I can't say much for their savory products yet. I'll save up money for it. Anyways, I've had their chocolate croissant and the plain on separate occasions.The chocolate croissant ($3) I've tried on 10/2/06, as an afternoon snack. I know I've ingested 2 1/2 croissants total, for that day; it scares me too. The chocolate croissant looks beautiful. The perfect golden brown hue throughout the the exterior of the croissant, the many distinctive layers that one can see from this photo...looks very encouraging. When I cut this in half, it flaked and it had a slight shatter effect. So, that's fine. (I would post up a pic, but it didn't go too well.) It has many soft layers in the interior, excellent butter flavor and great Valhrona dark chocolate, about 65-72% cocoa. I like it but if you're wondering, \"Is it my favorite?\" I'm saying, not really but it's among my top choices. Croissant rating: 3.5.Their plain croissant ($2.75) was eaten as my lunch on 10/4/06 with a small coffee, as you might have read from my previous blog. Anyways, the plain croissant is good, but it felt chilled for some reason. It still retained some crispness and flakiness. It tasted fine: good butter flavor, it's light in texture. But it befuddles my mind, why the heck is it chilled? Now, I'm inquiring is their quality is taking a downfall. I hope not or this will take a beating in Thomas Keller's reputation. Croissant rating: 2.5.Overall rating for Bouchon Bakery's croissants: 3. They have great service but lately I'm questioning their quality for the money you pay for.Le Pain Quotidien, a Belgian mini-chain and cafe. The branch I went to was on 922 7th Ave (W 58th St). I went there on 10/3/06 by opening time at 7:30 AM, technically they opened about 7:40, but that's another issue. Anyways, I ordered their plain croissant for $1.95 and a small coffee (which was pretty weak). The croissant has a good color, it's a little more of a homemade look because of the lack of sheen in comparison that Bouley or Bouchon has. When I took it apart, it was very flaky and crisp, not much of a shatter effect, also not too greasy. The taste was very good, nice buttery flavor, soft, chewy texture. It's nice.Croissant rating: 2.75.Overall Rating: 2.75. Service kind of bad, especially on the opening time.Financier Patisserie in 62 Stone St. (Mill Ln) in Wall Street District. It was some trek to find this place since Downtown is not exactly easy to navigate if you look at the street map of that area. I went there yesterday morning (10/5/06) at 8:30 AM. I've ordered a chocolate croissant, plain croissant, and other pastries that I'll write about in the future.The chocolate croissant ($2.10) looks great: the slight mahagony brown color, a shiny, varnish-like glaze and the visible layers of pastry. When I tore it apart, it flakes, and the interior felt soft. The problem is that I bite into it, there's no shatter effect or crunch to the teeth and it felt cold, as in refrigerated or chilled cold. The chocolate's good though but I would be really be happier if it was at least room temperature. What really puzzles me is that the croissant is cold and I'm eating it at 8:35 in the morning! Why? - Probably I should write scathing letters to every bakery with this problem if I'm continually facing this dilemma. Seriously, I will. Croissant rating: 2.5.The plain croissant looks promisisng. It's room temperature so no issues about that here. It's flaky and crisp when I tore it apart to see the interior. During the actual tasting, it has a slight shatter effect and tastes fine. Between the two, the plain croissant prevails. Croissant rating: 3.Overall rating: 2.8 out of 4.Patisserie Claude located on 187 W 4th St. (near 7th Ave. South) in West Village (one of my fave nabes to eat). I went there yesterday, 10/5/06 around 9 AM. It's a nondescript bakery where it is the runned by the fabled Croissant Nazi, owned by Claude who bakes and owns this establishment. Many patrons call him a nazi just because of his brusque, to-the-point manner but I have total respect for this old Frenchman. He's a god of croissants; I worship him now after eating this blessed croissant.I've only ordered a plain croissant ($1.50) since I'm digesting my Financier croissants and bought the Bouley croissants earlier. The plan was to eat this croissant at that moment, since many people have told me that it's best to eat his croissants on the spot since his stuff is made fresh and also I wanted to try his croissant before publishing this blog, to know if it's true or it's just hype.So, I've ordered the croissant, Claude was working in his kitchen, so a short Hispanic woman took my order. I kinda felt dissapointed not speaking to the man. But anyways, I took one of the very few tables in this place and begin to analyze this croissant. First of all, this croissant was still slightly warm! This is a first out of all the croissants I've eaten. It looks very simple and homemade for a croissant; no glaze, but great color. When I broke the croissant in two, it had was supremely flaky and the shatter effect was definetly there (it's so loud that you think a microphone was amplifying the sound). The interior was very moist due to the butter content and it was not greasy. The taste was excellent: the butter flavor was there and I detected a hint of salt in this pastry. It was unexpected but it was a welcoming flavor; it kind of counteracts the sweetness of the butter. I'm in heaven. I would've bought more of Claude's pastries like the quiche, and I saw a pastry that had a caramel top just came out of the oven, but I had to hold off because of everything else I ate and will eat around noon. So, I'll be seeing more of Claude in the future.Croissant rating: a very solid 4.Overall: 4; even though it's one croissant I'm grading this on, but if you know how to make your croissant, everything else is just butta. Croissants are difficult to make and master and I'll tell you, this man could make one mean croissant.To sum it up, the best croissants, in order (best to worst):1. Patisserie Claude2. Bouchon Bakery3 & 4 (tied). City Bakery & Bouley Bakery5. Financier Patisserie6. Le Pain de Quotidien7. Marquet PatisserieSo, hopefully I didn't kill you with words, but I just had to let it out. I would've tried more places for croissants like Balthazar Bakery in SoHo, Panya Bakery (a Japanese bakery) in East Village but I don't have time. I will go there in the future and try them but not now. I don't think my body could take it anymore.There's a second part to my insane search for the best croissants.

...I think I love you.Or your croissant-loving stomach. I didn't really like croissants until I came to Paris.  Out of your list, I had only tried Claude's and CB's.  Mmm, Clauuude.  Last time I went to his shop, he was really nice.  :)

Maybe I'm biased because I grew up on them but I adore the croissants at Zabar's.  And the ones at Blue Sky Bakery in Park Slope are pretty darn good as well (especially the almond).

My husband and I just checked out Patisserie Claude last weekend for the first time, and wholly agree with you. It was better (!) than anything we'd ever eaten Paris. I fell completely in love with the place.  Now I must eat my way through the rest of your list.

I live around the corner from Patisserie Claude and I am always telling people bemoaning the fate of the New York croissant to get there as soon as possible.  Also, I once experieced a very nice New York moment there.  The woman behind the counter burst into tears and then apologized to the line, explaining her grandmother had just died.  The older woman in front of me went around back and said, \"I think you need a hug.\"

Dahl - I've tried Blue Sky's muffins and they're pretty darn good. Probably it's one of my future \"assignments\" to blog about.Deb - Thank you for agreeing with me. I just hope you don't go to Marquet's in Brooklyn. Totally not worth the trip.Janet - Thanks. I want to go back and visit Claude's every morning. That's if I didn't care about my figure or my health at all. lol.Kate C. - You should always point everyone to Claude's for the perfect croissant in NYC. All I have to say is \"wow\" about that occurence.

Robyn,I've read this blog before, by chance about the same time I published my blog on croissants. Yes, I do find her Patisserie Claude experience very different than what others have painted him as. I still haven't got a chance to come back to his place but I'm counting on it very soon. Thanks for the link anyways. :)

Melissa - I'm planning to go to La Bergamote soon to revisit their croissants. I've been there before but I haven't tried their croissants for some reason.Anyways, there will be an updated list of sorts soon since I've been to a few more places to give their croissants a whirl.

Let me just tell you that the croissants from Financier are not made on premises, they are ordered from a company called LeCoq...A friend of mine works there, talk about lieing to customers. I think Bouley, Bouchon and Payard are the best. Claude, and especially Tisserie, are NOT croissants!!! :.)

I haven't gotten the chance to try Claude's almond croissants yet. I'm busy with the Restaurant Week postings that I need to save stomach space for the 3 course meals. Sorry.Probably in a week or two I'll try to eat more croissants. Even though it's about 3 months since I've touched croissants I have a backlash from eating too much of them.

Another place to try croissants is Chez Laurence on the corner of Madison and 38th. They have that shattering flaking you crave. Good brioche as well.

Thank you thank you for this post! I went to Patisserie Claude, and it was all worth tripping out there to west 4th st from Staten Island... I had the chocolate croissant and it was to die for! I thought I was in heaven! I wish i could have tried a plain croissant too, but the Frenchman said that I had the last croissant of the day ( around 1 pm) so i must definitely go back there in the morning ( around 8 am when they come out!) to try some more flavors!

I like the croissants at Le Bergamonte on the SW corner of 19th street and 9th avenue in Chelsea.Also very good are the croissants at the Slow Down Cafe in the hamlet of Andes, New York.  I guess that might be off topic as the topic is NYC croissants. Howeevr these are so good (i.e.. Montreal caliber) that I had to mention them.   Call ahead before making the trek as she is not always open.

I found the most delicious almond croissants at Taralucci e Vino (East Village at the corner of 10th and 1st Ave). They are super crispy and flaky  because they are twice baked. They are my favorite. Check it out. I just posted a blog on it at http://www.mangerlaville.blogspot.com

I am studying abroad in Berlin now, and I have become addicted to the Nuss-Nougat creme (Nutella chocolate or hazelnut cream with cruncy hazelnuts) croissants here. Do we not have these in NYC?
If you know a place where I can get these, I would be so thankful, as I will miss them when I come back.
Thanks :)

Today I went to Bouchon Bakery for lunch. Yeah, I know I have an addiction of sorts to Bouchon Bakery. It's the only place that I could mostly confide in that has really good food but at least I don't go there everyday...yet. hehehe... I would've gone downtown to Union Square if I knew my history professor would be out again. Grrr... *sighs* I guess everything happens for a reason.Anyways, the food...the food of choice for today is a small coffee ($1.85), plain croissant ($2.75) and a pumpkin macaroon ($2.75), with tax it's $7.97. I know it's not real food per se, but I'm not willing to part $9-$11 for a tuna nicoise or pork sandwich. I'm not that hungry, I'm in a snacking mood now.I've chatted a little with two employees about their macaroons because I just had a sudden craving for one. So, the one who took my order I asked what flavors they have today. She replied that they have the vanilla, chocolate, caramel, and the seasonal flavors; one of which she mentioned was pumpkin. I said to her,\"Pumpkin seems interesting.\" and she said, \"Today's the debut of this flavor.\" so, I ordered one. Then the guy who rung up the order who saw my pumpkin macaroon commented that it's \"so good.\" They're buttering me up for this, man. I'm thinking they better be right or hell would break loose.So, I managed to get a table with a good view outside of the building, very close to the gargantuan Samsung sign but not under it. Start unwrapping my goodies and took snapshots as you can see.The interior view of the pastries...Everything looks delectable. The croissant is flaky, crisp and buttery. Not greasy but somehow, I feel that it's not fresh enough in comparison to City Bakery. (More on croissants once I visit a few more places). The pumpkin macaroon is divine! Crisp, light outer shell. Moist, soft, and chewy interior...most of the desirable characteristics of a very good French macaroon. The pumpkin flavor is spot on. It has a good pumpkin-y flavor that is not overbearing with the spice, which most pastries like muffins, etc. have a downfall on, in which the pastry would have too much cloves or allspice. This is near perfection; certainly one of the best macaroons I've had in a long time.

Nah, it's totally real food.  The first time I went to Bouchon I tried a gazillion things with a friend.  I think we spent about $20 each.  >__< Mmhm I know where I'm going when I go back home.  Pumpkin macaron sounds so good!

I barely survived two and a half days of indulgence consisting mostly of the baked goods I've made and I feel like I'm in a food coma. Eh, it's not a great feeling for me. Yesterday, I've mentioned that I'm making mantou and cookies. My mom requested that she wanted the darn things by 5 AM. Do you know why? It's because my mom is one of those crazy maniacs who would go for the Early Bird shopping for Black Friday and I'm the victim of her madness to be dragged along. Jeez. There goes my sleep.Thankfully I took care of most of the preparation yesterday afternoon during the time my dad was roasting the turkey around 3 PM. I mixed the ingredients of the Oatmeal Coconut Raisin cookies by hand. (The recipe is based on Martha Stewart's Oatmeal Raisin Cookie but I added 1 cup of coconut since my mom loves that stuff.) I have the hand mixer but I don't like using it for cookie dough batters because they're not durable enough to cream the butter and the fact that they fling the batter all over the place even at a low setting. I don't own those stand mixers even though I keep campaigning and persuading my mom to get one for me for the past two years but to no avail. *Sighs* maybe next year.Anywho, after squishing, stirring and mixing my arms out for the cookies. I went onto prepping the mantou. I just used some of my leftover sourdough starter that I've saved and just mixed in some flour, water, a tablespoon of sugar and salt. Let it proof for a few hours and then knead for 5 minutes or so until it passes the windowpane test. (The windowpane test is basically taking a small piece of dough and try to stretch it as thin as possible without breaking or tearing a hole that you can see light through it). Shape and proof it again.The good thing is that my mom tends to wake up the wee hours of the morning, as in 4 AM! She started banging pans around the kitchen, making a racket in the entire house waking up most of the family. I got fed up with the noise and it's a very clear indication that she wants food. So, she started steaming the mantou and I started to preheat the oven and brew really strong coffee. After 15 to 20 minutes, my dad woke up from the aroma of baked cookies and the coffee, and mumbled, \"Morning\" and go straight for the coffee. I don't blame him at all, I really needed the coffee, too. So here how it looked like:All's fine in the house; my younger brother is miraculously still asleep. We ate good food, still some other leftover baked goods like the pies you can barely see in the mantou pic. The mantou is basically a plain (in my opinion, quite bland but my parents love it anyways), airy, slightly chewy bun. My parents approve the bun's flavor but my taste buds detest it so I smeared it with some peanut butter to have some flavor going on. I probably think it's so tasteless is because my taste buds are too Americanized...?The cookies were really yummy. It's golden brown on the exterior with a slight crispness from a slightly darker, almost mahogany bottom. The interior is soft and chewy filled with tons of oats, coconut and the sweet, chewy raisins. The cinnamon, nutty aroma is intoxicating, especially when it just came out from the oven.After all that has been eaten, my parents and I got out of the house around 5:30 AM and start our shopping craze.Just to finish off the food porn, here's my oatmeal coconut raisin cookie:Now, I need a nap.Zzzzz...

Giulia - Thanks. The mantou is accessible at any Chinese grocery store. I'm not a huge fan of that stuff but my parents love it since they eat it during their childhood.Why can't we have a baking party? It would be tons of fun and good food.

Round One: Baking for Turkey Day (Thanksgiving)

Happy Thanksgiving to everyone in America, as well as everyone in the world! Even though, you might not celebrate the holiday, at least I'll spread some cheer across the world. :)No, I haven't really eat out the past week because I'm trying to purge my body from excess food that I'll be consuming over this holiday weekend. Sorry, but I'll make it up next week.I've already started baking since yesterday; even though it's not Thanksgiving yet. It sometimes scares me how much food I'll end up ingesting over the five days that I'm at home.So far, I baked sourdough bread and orange cranberry muffins for my family for yesterday morning's breakfast. (If you want to jump to the muffins, click here.) Hence, the idea that it's round one of baking because the day after Thanksgiving, I'm baking cookies and mantou (a Chinese plain, white bun). Oy. I'm already imagining the weight I'll be gaining.Anyways, the sourdough bread was an initiative that I've taken because of the fact that I finally persuaded my mom to buy lots of King Arthur flour because: (1) It's on sale and (2) I like the fact that after reading numerous cook/baking books that King Arthur flour has a higher gluten content compared to other brands of all-purpose flour; which makes a crusty bread a bit more chewier. Well, actually I have some King Arthur bread flour from a few months ago that I haven't finished up, so that went into most of my sourdough starter.The recipe I've used it actually a hybrid of a lot of three different sourdough recipes, so I can't really credit the person or company that created the recipe. The starter is from King Arthur Flour, the walnut raisin half of the sourdough is slightly adapted from King Arthur, and the plain sourdough was from a fellow blogger, the Foppish Baker.For those of you who don't really know or how sourdough bread is made, it's basically two major parts to it but it's a bit tedious, especially on the first part the starter.My starter is basically two cups of unbleached bread flour (I used King Arthur but you may use another brand and I like unbleached flour more because there are less chemicals and human intervention with a good ingredient), a package of yeast, and two cups of warm water with a tablespoon of sugar. Mix all the ingredients and let it sit out in room temperature, covered with a clean dish towel. Every morning I feed the starter (I call it the \"mom\") with half a cup of flour, same amount of water, and a teaspoon of granulated sugar for the next 3 days.I was actually worried or paranoid that it won't turn out well but seeing that on Tuesday night; I'm happy. The mom (starter) had a beer, yeasty aroma, and the thickness of pancake batter. Not fruity because of the fact that there's no fruit to aid in the fermentation, though you may use grapes to start the starter.I scooped out a cup of the proof and mixed the flour, water and yeast again, and let it proof overnight to really get the bread making started.After sitting out overnight with a clean kitchen towel, it bubbled and expanded and it eventually looked like this:From here, I took from the Foppish Baker's recipe to split the dough into two. One of the halves will be the plain sourdough and the other will be the raisin walnut sourdough. The plain half was placed into a large greased bowl and covered to let it go to its first proof. The other half was mixed with toasted walnuts and pre-soaked raisins and then placed into another large, greased bowl for proofing as well.The shaping phase; I thought of sticking with the boule shape because I know that making it into a baguette would be a bit tedious because I know I don't have the baguette pan to help keep its shape. I don't have the bannetons (a basket that shapes the bread) because I'm not willing to shell out $30 for something that I don't use often. So, it'll be a free-form boule.I let them proof for the second time and then stick it in the fridge overnight since I'm planning to bake and eat these in the morning.I was actually surprised how huge they were! After taking these photos, I got some sleep and got up 5 AM. Unfortunately, I have to, my mother is one of those people who must eat early in the morning or she'll throw a tantrum if you don't feed her. Anyways, I took out the pans of bread and let it sit out while I'm preheating my oven at 500 degrees with a heavy pan sitting on the bottom of my oven and two other sheet pans to act as a baking stone of the oven. This idea came from Rose Levy Beranbaum's book, The Bread Bible.Once I preheated the oven for half an hour or so, I placed both loaves into its own sheet pan and throw in a cup of ice to the heavy metal sheet pan that is sitting on the bottom of the oven. The results were actually good, as you can see down below.I'm really happy with the blistered crust on both loaves but the plain sourdough held its shape better than the walnut raisin. I guess because the raisins were soaked in water, therefore more moisture to the dough. So, my mental note for next time is to knead in more flour for that bread. The crumb texture of both breads had irregular holes! So, I'm very content with that.Both loaves had the thin, crisp, almost mahogany in color and the crumb texture is light and moist like those sliced packaged bread one can purchase at a grocery store. The difference between the two is that the plain sourdough had a slightly tangy, yeasty aroma that is almost like a sourdough bread I had in San Francisco, but it wasn't fermented or proof out long enough for my starter, so it lacked that \"sour\" taste. The raisin walnut bread is slightly different because of the sweetness that imparted from the raisins and the crunchy nuttiness from the walnuts that gave it an interesting texture to the crisp bread. Overall, I'm pleased with the results for baking sourdough bread for the first time.Orange Cranberry MuffinsBriefly, so I won't kill you from reading so much, I'll talk about my orange cranberry muffins. It sounds very \"fallish\" doesn't it? Cranberries are so ubiquitous during the fall and my mom bought it a few weeks ago, all we did was wash the berries, dried it and freeze it.This recipe is based on Martha Stewart's blueberry muffins the changes I made was obviously replacing the blueberries with cranberries, added the zest of a medium orange, a teaspoon of orange extract, a 1/4 cup more granulated sugar because of the tartness of the cranberry.Well, now you got a glimpse of my holiday baking craze. I hope you all will be having a good time spending time with your family, if not well, what can I say? I'm just thankful that even though I have some tiffs with my mom, I love my family and I'm grateful that I have what I have. You know what I mean? Once again, Happy Thanksgiving, everyone! I'll try to eat out next week. 'Til then, happy eating!

Hey Tina!I've been reading you blog for quite a while, and I have to say that I love it more and more with every post! I spent freshman year at NYU, so many of the places you visit definitely made me homesick - gah, I think I could live off of croissants! It's nice to know that I'm not the only pastry obsessed individual :) Keep up the awesome posting and Happy Thanksgiving!http://www.apassionforfood.blogspot.com

Kathy - Thanks for loving my blog. :) Ah, I wish we all could live off of buttery pastries so everyone could be happy but it seems our bodies reject the excess amounts of fat ingested. Happy Thanksgiving to you, too!

It's nearing the holidays and I want to hone my baking skills again just because I have no school on Friday and I have no important tests to take care of this week, and damn it, I want chocolate! So, it's my excuse to bake for a short period of time (an hour including the vanilla creme anglaise sauce).The first thing I made was the creme anglaise just because it needs to be cooled for at least an hour or two so that it's thick enough to be creamy and silky to the palate.After pouring the creme anglaise, then into the fridge. Sorry for that fragment...Now onto the chocolate souffle!Modified 11/26/06: Photo-technical difficulty therefore the change to this post, if you have read this earlier. Fotki dropped off my trial account; so now I'm switching back to Flickr Pro account (it's cheaper too). You may still see the photos for this particular post by clicking on the link that I've indicated about the slideshow.Both tasted very good comfort dessert food that isn't so fussy (at least to me) the baking time took 10 minutes. So, the wait wasn't so bad and one must consume immediately. As for the leftover creme anglaise, I drank it up. What? It's not like you lick, eat or drink up something straight up (for example, spooning peanut butter or Nutella and lick it off)?Well, at least I still got some of my cake baking skills. Hopefully my pies on Turkey Day are fine, amongst the other stuff I would be baking.If you want to see the steps done on a slideshow (would be cool to look at), click here.If you want the recipes, just write a comment and I'll post it.(Added 11/19/06)Individual Chocolate Souffles (from Gourmet Magazine)Recipe yield: 2Unsalted butter and sugar for coating the souffle dishes5 ounces fine-quality semisweet chocolate, chopped2 egg yolks1 tablespoon dark rum (or you may use vanilla extract if you don't want booze)1/2 tablespoon unsalted butter3 egg whitesPinch of cream of tartarPinch of saltPreheat oven to 400 degrees F. Butter 2 1-cup souffle dishes and sprinkle with sugar.In a metal bowl over a pot of hot, but not simmering, water melt the chocolate, stirring until smooth. Remove bowl from heat and whisk in the egg yolks, one at a time. Whisk in the rum and butter.In a bowl with an electric mixer beat the egg whites with the cream of tartar and a pinch of salt until they hold stiff peaks.Stir one fourth of the whites into the chocolate mixture and then fold in remaining whites gently but thoroughly.Spoon the mixture into 2 1-cup souffle dishes that have been buttered and sprinkled with sugar.Bake the souffles on a baking sheet in the middle of the preheated oven for 10 to 12 minutes, or until they are puffed. (My additional note: Must consume immediately! Or the souffle would deflate. Not like we have a problem with that... ^^ ).

I woke up this morning and thought to myself, \"I want some Chinese food.\" Obviously being in New York, that means Chinatown. So, before I left my house I just grab a cup of coffee and a banana, in hopes of stuffing myself with good Chinese food.The problem with the morning commute is that I haven't been to Chinatown in a loong time, as in the last time I've written about Chinatown was about 2 months ago, long. So, I've lost my way there wandering around the streets trying to figure out where the heck are the three spots I want to go to: Dumpling House, Dragon Boat Cafe, and Double Crispy.Eventually, I found Double Crispy and ordered for some egg custard tarts. This particular bakery is known for their multiple variations of the traditional egg custard tart. Those of you know like to know a few \"pronunciations\" or the name of the tart in Cantonese, it's called dan tat. They only had two flavors available at the time: the standard, plain egg custard and the one that looks like a take on creme brulée. Here's the photos:The regular egg tart is 50 cents and the vanilla/creme brulee type is 80 cents; in other words, it cost me $1.30. It was limited in their flavor varieties because it's 7:30 AM. It's fine with me, I have more room to eat more food.Both tarts were slightly warm to the touch: it's a good thing because it's fresh. The regular tart is tasty. It's just the way it should be; the crust or tart shell is both flaky and crumbly that it has a good balance of both qualities that is desired in any pie or tart crust. Not greasy (I've eaten several tarts that are pretty darn oily: not a good thing) and the custard itself has a smooth, rich, and creamy mouthfeel, just enough sweetness that it doesn't kill your palate.The vanilla/creme brulee tart has the same characteristics as the regular. The differences are that it has the dark spots on the custard that looks like a creme brulee of sorts; it's more sweeter (but not killer sweet) and has a stronger vanilla flavor. It's a nice variation. I've tried those - what I call weird flavors - green tea and black sesame from Tai Pan Bakery in Flushing and I don't really like it. It just tastes strange to me (I think the flavors were off?) but that was years ago but I'm willing to try Crispy's variations since their tarts are better than Tai Pan's, in my opinion.The next stop is Dragon Boat Cafe. It's a buzzing place where it seems like many Chinese locals come here for their breakfast and it's my first time here. I walked in and thought to myself, \"What am I in the mood for?\" Even one of the girls who worked there was waiting for my order as I stared at the dizzying array of buns, tarts, cakes, etc. Finally I came up with the decision of getting a fried sesame ball (called jien duy, in Cantonese; cost 80 cents) and a pineapple bun (bo lo bau; cost 60 cents), totaling $1.30. I know, the whole $1.30 thing is somehow repeating but it was really unplanned.The fried sesame ball:To tell you honestly, it's been probably 5 years since I've eaten a fried sesame ball. Usually, I have issues with establishments and their deep fryer: they don't tend to change their oil often enough. So, this is the only time I really let my conscience go because I just want to eat it. Ain't it pretty? It has a beautiful golden brown exterior coated with sesame seeds, almost hot to the touch (happiness, because it's practically felt like it's been out of the fryer about 5 minutes ago so I know it's fresh at least. Well somewhat, because my oil issue just kicked into my mind now). Anyways, the exterior crust was really crisp that I really have to sink my teeth into that thing and once I did, out came a somewhat loud crunch. To me, it's a good indicator that it isn't a mushy grease bomb that is covered in seeds, which I've eaten many of these sesame balls in my earlier years that are awful. This is a very good one. After that hard exterior, then came a soft, chewy rice dough (don't worry, it's cooked), after that layer is my personal favorite part, the smooth, sweet, lotus seed paste. Ahh...this is delicious. I reveled in this fried ball for a moment. This is how it looks like after two bites:The pineapple bun was fine. Nothing special about it in comparison to the ones I've eaten in Flushing, Queens. To those of you who never had a pineapple bun, it looks like this:It's slightly smushed because the woman who packed my stuff, squished my bun. I always see this flaw of squeezing the life out of any baked bun that I order from a Chinese bakery and it always annoys me. *sighs* Anyways, it's called a pineapple bun because of the sweet, crumbly, yellow-golden brown crust looks somewhat like a pineapple but not taste like a pineapple. The bun itself should be light and airy, as you see here:It's somewhat compressed since I have to tear the darn thing to have a texture shot, sorry, but you get the point. It's slightly sweet and it smells yeasty after I tore the bread into two.There are some variations that looks very similar to a pineapple bun that could be filled with red beans (think adzuki beans or if you don't know what that is, think sweet red bean paste that can be a little chunky for texture), black bean (once again, sweet), coconut flakes, etc.After eating those and walking around Chinatown for a while, all of a sudden I had a hankering for dumplings. My mind clicked to the Dumpling House. I never went there before except the fact that many people from Chowhound directs others to eat there for cheap dumplings, so I kept that in mind and now I'm there. I didn't really realize that the location of this place is actually bordering the Lower East Side and Chinatown, so it took me a good deal of time to find this place.It's actually a small hole-in-the-wall establishment that has a tiny counter with practically no seating, maybe some standing room in the back. A Chinese woman was working there and when I asked for dumplings in Cantonese, she replied back to me in Mandarin. So, with that whole loss of communication there, I went off with English and thankfully she understood me. I bought the standard deal, 5 pan-fried pork and chive dumplings for $1. Probably one of the best deals in town, in my opinion.After paying the dumplings, I whisked off to the nearest park to eat my dumplings, which was about a block away. When I opened the Styrofoam container, it was steaming hot, releasing its meaty, pan-fried grease smell. But that was the biggest issue I have it - the greae. I know I can't ask for much for paying $1, but it's my own little thing with food that I'm always critiquing. Besides that, the dumplings were meaty, juicy (probably the fat ratio from the pork is higher, maybe 20% fat?)The dumplings are delicious though, despite my nagging annoyance with grease. It's perfectly seasoned, oniony flavored from the chives, and a very nice crunch from the bottom crust; which is a good contrast of the soft, juiciness of the dumpling from a crisp crust from sticking on the wok (the large, round pan that is usually used for pan frying dumplings).I went off with the rest of the morning shopping for calligraphy supplies in Pearl Paint and search for Christmas cards because Christmas is coming and classes are about to be over; I have to start cranking out the cards to friends and family with calligraphy.I had another pang for a snack around 12:30 and I was in Chelsea. I thought of going to Rickshaw's Dumpling Bar for their chocolate dumplings, since I remembered reading about them last winter in a NY Magazine article. I walked over to that dumpling bar, as they called themselves, and waited on line for a few minutes. It's lunch hour and the local business crowd are going for their dumplings (the savory ones) for lunch. As I looked around, it basically a clean, well lit place that is slightly Industrial/modern decor - it's very streamlined and somewhat minimalist with lots of seating.They had a bunch of different options of dumplings from the traditional pork to the low carb and if you want it in soup or fried and then the one that I'm looking for: the chocolate dumplings ($3). Also, I was thirsty and since it's kind of what I'm considering it as my dessert course of the day, I added the Thai iced coffee ($2.95). It cost me $6.45 with tax. I know, it's not cheap. They gave me a number and as I waited, it's photo op time.It's a takeout box containing my 3 chocolate dumplings and my Thai iced coffee. I haven't tried Thai coffee before but I've always heard that it's a sweet coffee, which was my original forethought of this as my dessert course.It is a sweet, not cloyingly sweet, strong coffee. Not espresso strong but more like a strong brewed coffee flavor that has an initial smoky, bold flavor with a nice caramel finish. Probably it came from the evaporated milk. I'm not too sure but it tasted good.The highlight of the day: the chocolate dumplings.Anywhoo, the chocolate dumplings are basically deep fried mochi balls filled with melted chocolate with Plugra butter (ooh...those of you who aren't keen on the butter business, Plugra butter is basically an American made butter from Keller's Creamery with a much higher butterfat content that of the typical American brand, 82.5% compared to 80%; so less water content equals richer flavor and texture to your food, pastry, etc.). I took a bite from one of these dumplings and it oozed chocolate with the synchronization of the slightly crisp exterior. It tasted nutty from the black sesame seeds, dark chocolate was good (about 60% cocoa) and it wasn't very sweet. I would dub this my little chocolate dumpling of love. hahaha... It's really good and it goes well with the coffee.That's my Chinese/Asian food craving day, even though it's more Asian fusion for dessert but you know what I mean.The addresses of these spots:Double Crispy230 Grand StreetNew York, NYGolden Dragon Boat Cafe111 BoweryNew York, NYDumpling House118 Eldridge StreetNew York, NYRickshaw's Dumpling Bar61 W 23rd StreetNew York, NYIf you want to see the all of the photos of this post with the some shots of the establishments, click here.For a map of where I went, click here.

The NYC Chocolate Show! (My Kind of Heaven!)

Yesterday afternoon, Friday, November 10th, I went to the 9th Annual NYC Chocolate Show. I arrived there about 12 PM and I already bought the ticket online for $25.05 (regular admission is $25 at the door), including the discount code from Frommer's; it’s just the shipping and fees TicketMaster kicks in to inflate the charges further instead of $15. But I’m not complaining I avoided the long line waiting to get a ticket in person. When I got into the Chocolate Show, they stamped my hand so I could come back in later on today, if I want, and I checked my coat, which was $2.It was already a crowded place, buzzing with activity: vendors vying to get the attendees’ attention to try and especially purchase their chocolates, book signings with various pastry and candy cookbook authors, cooking demonstrations from pastry chefs and tastings in the Chocolate Lounge. There is no problem getting people to get samples, it’s a given to this show and there are a good amount of people buying chocolate anyway.The hoards of people make me feel claustrophobic.The predominant sales would go to Payard; Kopper’s is actually popular toward the younger crowd as I looked around. As some of you know, I’m a picky chocolate connoisseur and I’m not too fond of Payard because it’s not extraordinary chocolate. I mean, it's good but not great. I don’t like Kopper’s at all because it’s just chocolate covered nuts and whatnot, so obviously I'm not bought.Those of you who do love Payard's chocolates, the little purses that have 2 pieces of chocolate bonbons are $3.50, same as the small cube which also contain 2 pieces. I don't know about Kopper's because they don't appeal to me.I bought three items; all are small gift boxes: Cosmic Chocolate’s Cosmic Bombs (4 pieces for $8), Recchiuti’s 4 piece chocolate box ($10) and Marquise de Sevigne’s box of chocolates ($18). The one that is out of the ordinary from what I would usually buy (something elegant in taste and looks, dark bittersweet chocolate and not sweet) is Cosmic Chocolate because of its cocktail inspired flavors. I’m regretting not going to Mary’s chocolates first because I didn’t know where the heck it was until I bought everything and I didn’t bring enough money with me and they don’t take credit cards. So, right now I’m banging my head against my desk for not buying their absolutely exquisite chocolates both in design and in flavor and texture.One company called Mad Mac NYC, sells MACARONS! The ones that Robyn have talked and consumed on copious amounts in Paris and inspired me to search for some in NYC. I was tempted to buy a large macaron (it's $2.50) but somehow I didn't act on the impulse of buying one. I don't know why. Probably because I'm surrounded by 99% chocolate companies, that I'm turned off by macarons? Oh, how my mind works... Anyways, at your disposal, you may see their display.Mary’s is a Japanese chocolate company that has many beautiful chocolates that may be exotic to some people, especially Americans. The two samples they have given out throughout the entire show were their green tea truffle (a white chocolate based truffle covered with green tea powder; it had subtle notes of citrus flavor and the green tea powder is definitely not matcha tea (which is usually bitter and bold), this tea is very muted and soft) and the black sesame truffle (a white chocolate truffle flavored with brandy and it’s a new flavor, as been told during the tasting, and rolled in black sesame seeds; it’s very nutty in flavor because of the sesame seeds). I like both but prefer the green tea more because of the subtlety and smooth, creamy mouthfeel (I know, it’s wine speak but it makes sense to what I’m talking about now). They brought a few of their chocolatiers to actually have them make their chocolates in the booth. It was actually interesting to watch how meticulous it is to make such wonderful chocolate. As you can see:There's more kimono detail pics in my album (see link at the end of the post).Unfortunately, during their chocolate and green tea tasting in the Chocolate Lounge, someone in the audience asked if they have any retail locations in New York City and the speaker/Japanese translator said, “No, we don’t.” So once again, I’m mentally kicking myself not buying their chocolates. At least there’s always next year to do buy it.I attended 3 different demonstrations at the Chocolate Lounge. The lounge is basically a partitioned room that is covered in dark brown velvet, chocolate bonbon shape and designed couches, and a heavy cloth toward the back of the room of the countryside, finished off with dimmed lighting of soft yellow-orange. It's kind of lounge, laid back kind of feeling. As you can kind of see here:I attended the Hershey's tasting, which they're trying to introduce their new line of regional chocolates called Cacao Reserve, and try to teach the audience how to taste chocolate (i.e. the smell, the snap, the bite and let the chocolate melt on your tongue). Usually I don't eat Hershey's bars because they're too sweet and it's milk chocolate but the ones they're giving out for sampling is not bad. At the end of the show, they gave out goody bags of their new line of chocolate. As you can see laid out on my table at home:The other demonstrations besides the aforementioned, Mary's Chocolate and Green Tea tastings and the Hershey's was a bartender who created an alcoholic chocolate drink (they checked I.D.s, by the way), named Arbor's Delight.It's a scotch based drink (single malt): liquid chocolate, Grand Marnier, and flamed or burned the orange peel to release the orange flavor and aroma. It's very smoky, potent; it took over all of the chocolate and orange flavor that left me with a thought of, \"Where's the chocolate?\" I could only smell it but not taste it. Only the men seem to like this drink but not the women in the audience.The one vendor that is absent from this Chocolate Show was Jacques Torres. This is a surprise to me since I’ve always read for the past few years that Mr. Torres is usually the front man of this show and for some reason, he chose not to be a part of the show this year. Hmmm…too bad.Another vendor that I would like to highlight in the show is Marquis de Sevignes from France. Besides the fact that they have elegant chocolates (that is quite pricey but I still bought anyway), is that they have a survey out to whoever is interested in trying four chocolate bonbons (chocolate enrobed pieces with a filling): crème brûlée, a dark chocolate ganache (I think it said 80-90% cocoa?), citron, and a praline. You try each piece, give it a rating from 1 (the worst) – 10 (the best) and any comment you would like to add for each piece of chocolate. I liked all of them but my favorite out of the group was the dark chocolate ganache because it was dark chocolate, smooth, silky, great chocolate scent and it had a good, delicate snap from the outer chocolate shell. The least favorite was the crème brûlée because it was too darn sweet. These chocolates were inspired by their chocolate bar flavors that they are selling now for $5; it's about the size of what you would get from a Lindt bar, about 3 - 4 ounces.The other vendor that I don’t know too much but really loved their chocolate truffles were from Romanicos Chocolate. I’ve tasted their coconut truffle and a berry truffle...it is sublime! It’s a soft dark chocolate ganache type of truffles and it’s melts in your mouth. Oh…I’m reminiscing that truffle. I also managed to get a couple of samples for another chocoholic friend of mine, Kim, and when she tried it, she had a chocolate-gasm and blocked out from reality for a good minute or so. It really blew her mind how good it was. I was tempted to take a photo of her reaction but I think she would kill me doing so. I’m just reading the Chocolate Show’s program and it said this company is based in Florida. Double damn. Problem is that if I did buy this chocolate, I know I would eat it practically the day of or the latest, today.Speaking of samples, I probably ate half a pound of chocolate yesterday and managed to get almost a pound of chocolate for Kim. Why not? The vendors don’t really care and I want to make my ticket admission worthwhile. All I could say is after spending four hours at the Chocolate Show, I know I’ve eaten probably two to three times the maximum intake of saturated and unsaturated fats and 1,000 calories at least. But it’s the day after my birthday and it’s my own treat of sorts. I might come back next year to get a box of Mary’s and Romanico’s chocolate.If you want to see more photos of the Chocolate Show, click here.

It was fun. My belly was full of chocolate so it was kind of hard walking it off since I felt a bit lethargic with the sugar crashing and the excess chocolate after leaving that show.

The Best of Croissants...Part 2

Well as promised, I would continue my trek for some great croissants that could match Mr. Claude's. Actually there is a potential rival. I have visited another ten bakeries. So here's the list...(and I'm still using the same rating system)Balthazar Bakery located in 80 Spring Street (near Crosby St.) in SoHo. It's a popular place for all things French since it created a huge buzz back five to ten years ago. I never ate in their restaurant but I went to their bakery a few times before.I tried their Almond Croissant ($2.50) a few hours after I bought it. I know, moisture and humidity might've killed the texture of the croissant a bit but I found the croissant in general, quite bread-like in texture. It's not crispy, it lacked the shatter effect but it had a little bit of flakiness. It tasted good though; a sweet (a bit too sweet) almond paste filling in the center and it's not greasy. Rating: 2.7 out of 4. It would've been a close 3, if it was crisper.Joyce Bakeshop at 646 Vanderbilt Ave., in Park Slope, Brooklyn. If you've read from my previous post about this bakery's macarons, I had a slightly negative review on those macarons. When it came to their plain croissant ($2) it didn't really do any better. The positive part: the croissant was a bit flaky and I heard the crisp shatter from biting it. The negative: it was quite greasy and the flavor was bordering bland - the butter flavor of the pastry is not shining through here. It's ok, not the greatest and not the worst. Rating: 2.5 out of 4.Tisserie at 857 Broadway (at 17th St) was the next destination for a plain croissant ($2). I didn't really have high expectations for this place on croissants because it's not a French bakery. It's actually Venezuelan with a French influence.Their croissant looks decent but a bit too narrow than a typical croissant.The croissant was really crisp but there's no shatter effect that didn't result much flakiness when I tore it apart. It doesn't have a real buttery flavor, it's not bland per se, but it's not flavorful either. Rating: 2 out of 4.I have recently visited Patisserie Claude again but this time I tried his pan au chocolate, a.k.a. chocolate croissant ($1.85) at 7:30 AM. It was filled with a lot of loyal, local patrons who already occupied the tables which was unexpected to me (kind of). But anyways, it was fresh out of the oven and Mr. Claude was actually doing the transactions (he was actually nice). I walked over to Joe's coffee on Waverly Place (a few blocks away) and ate it with their house coffee. The croissant was still warm. As you can see in the photos, the dark chocolate is still gooey (about 70% cocoa content). The croissant does not have much the shatter effect compared to the plain, probably it's too warm? It was particularly greasy - as you can see at the photo, which was the biggest pitfall; at least it was still delicious. Rating: 3 out of 4.Panya Bakery located at 10 Stuyvesant St. (3rd Ave. & E 9th St) in the East Village; I've been to this Japanese bakery before a year ago and I remembered some of their stuff was pretty good but I haven't tried their croissants before. So, my curiosity came over and I went down there to try their croissants, well at least two of their nine varieties of both sweet and savory.The first one I tried was their mini whole wheat croissant (60 cents). Isn't it adorable? It's about snack size, 2 to 3 inches in length. It has good color, it smelled wholesome yet it had a sinfully buttery scent, too. It was really crisp and had great shatter effect. There's just a slight hint of grease on the fingertips but really unnoticeable until you really look at it. The flavor of the whole wheat gives it a slight nutty essence and the butter flavor really permeates throughout the crumb. It's actually one of the better whole wheat croissants I've eaten in a long time.

It's actually one of the better whole wheat croissants I've eaten in a long time. Rating: 3.2 out of 4.The other croissant I had from Panya was their ham & cheese croissant ($2). It had a gorgeous lacquered, golden brown exterior and it smelled of butter. It was very crisp and it had good shatter effect. I forgot to use a knife to cut the darn thing so that explains why the ham and cheese is dangling out of one of the halves. Anyways, the ham was the regular ham you would get from a deli and the cheese was American cheese from a deli as well. I wouldn't expect fresh baked ham and Keen's cheddar (an English cheddar - very good by the way) in it since it's $2. But it's yummy and not particularly greasy. It's good breakfast food for those who don't have sweet tooths; not everyday of course unless you want to raise your cholesterol. Rating: 3 out of 4.One of the commenters from my previous post on croissants claimed that Zabar's located at 2245 Broadway (80th Street) in the Upper West Side, was good. I ventured there for breakfast before my morning class, since John Jay is actually not too far from there, and gave their plain croissant a whirl (cost $1.65). The croissant looked good: the shape was fine, it had a decent, light golden brown color and a slight sheen from the glaze. However, it was was not crisp and it does not have any shatter when I teared it in half. Disappointment...the interior looked ok, a lot of irregular holes which kind of reminds me of bread - not really a good thing to look for in a croissant. This means that the croissant's texture is going to be more soft and bread-like than crisp, flaky lightness that I seek in a great croissant. When it comes to taste, it has a very vague hint of butter flavor not much of going on. To sum it up, it's soft, light and slightly moist in the center. The egg glaze probably is the reason why it's soft on the exterior (as you can see on the bottom of the croissant); it gives a nice golden brown color but no crispness to any baked good as I have done this for many years on my homemade baked soft white bread loaves. Not the best croissant I've ever eaten. But at least their coffee was not bad; they just added a little too much milk in my coffee. Rating: 2.5 out of 4.Almondine Bakery located at 85 Water St. in Dumbo, Brooklyn. I have been to this bakery when it first opened - yeah, it was a loong time ago and I remembered it was one of the superb bakeries in the city. So I thought I should repay a visit and try some of their baked goods. It was around 8 AM when I arrived there and they had a couple of baked goods out like the croissants, a couple of danishes, creme brulee, cupcakes and their highly rated baguettes from the NY Magazine article that was out recently. I tried their plain butter croissant ($1.95), amongst the other goods. It was slightly warm and very crisp - the slightest touch to the croissant, you can hear it's brittle song. When I tore it in half, it shattered and flaked. Not at all greasy and it had a wonderful buttery scent. Mm...I was sensing delirium's coming to me once I take a bite out this croissant. The taste was very ethereal - it's buttery good and it has a great mouthfeel to it - it's light and delicate. I love this croissant. It's the closest to perfection for a croissant in my book! Rating: 3.75 out of 4.So, as you can see I love Almondine's croissant. So go out to Dumbo, Brooklyn and get some of their croissants (and pastries)!I finally went back to La Bergamote after a long absence from this place for half a year and I tried their chocolate croissant ($2.45? I don't recall exactly how much I paid for it but it's around that price). It's very crisp, flaky, buttery, and has the shatter effect from biting it. The croissant has good dark bittersweet chocolate, about 70% cocoa. It's very good. Rating: 3.3 out of 4.Silver Moon Bakery's plain croissant. I have sung much praise for this bakery and their croissant; if you have read my previous two posts. Here's what I wrote, in case you haven't read it:\"Isn't it a thing of beauty? Perfectly golden brown exterior, buttery aroma, it has the crisp shatter effect from the slightest pressure. Oh, I'm getting excited! (Hey, I love food. If you don't have any feelings for food, you don't love food; you're just eating for the sake of eating. One must appreciate the effort those bakers/chefs/cooks put into their product and if it's good and exquisite, then it's worth loving the product, the baker/chef/cook, and possibly the institution of where you bought that product).Sorry about the sidetrack, I just need to get that out of my chest since some people think I'm strange (in person) the way I react to food. Back to the croissant. When I tear this beautiful, buttery pastry, it sang it's brittle shatter song along with the sounds of thick broken glass, with the fall of thin, delicate shards of it's flaky exterior. The moment I bite into the croissant, it had the shatter at the bite and it was actually very light in texture. I'm delightfully surprised because the woman I spoke to said it was dense. Hmm...anyways, it was (as I said) light, delicate and it had the faint creamy hint of butter flavor. I have to say this is one of the best croissants I've ever eaten in my entire life! J'adore! C'est magnifique!\" Rating: 3.75 out of 4.The last and final croissant (not their coronetti) was from Taralucci i Vino; cost $1.50 with tax comes out to $1.65. It's very crisp and flaky to the touch with a tiny bit of shatter effect. I should consider the fact that I bought and ate this croissant at 11:45 AM, I'm not expecting perfection but it's not bad really. It tasted buttery - good butter flavor, not stale at all.

I wondered if you ever got to taste Jacques Torres' croissant at his Water street shop? Surprisingly good and Frenchie, though I'm not happy eating a croissant on a paper composite plate and there was no jam to speak of :(There's a new French patisserie in Astoria, called Le petit Prince on Broadway between 33rd  and 34th streets. I am now motivated to try their croissant! I'll report back if there's any good news but thanks VERY MUCH! this was a fun read.

Carol - Thanks for reading this post! I don't think I have tried Jacques' croissant in either of his establishments. (I just enamored by his Mudslide cookie every time I visit there.)If you happen to find a great croissant anywhere in NYC, please do report back!

La Bergamote is my fave, but I'll have to try Almondine.

Update on My New Home, Silver Moon Bakery

I went uptown this morning to have breakfast at Silver Moon Bakery. All I did was have a cup of coffee and a banana before I get out of my house at 6 AM. Those of you reading this, might be thinking, \"What! You get out of your house at 6 AM!\" Yeah, partly because it's about 1 1/4 hours for me to get there from my house and my mom's up, bugging me. So, I'm trying to evade her by leaving home early. I know, it's kind of mean to do that to my mom. I love her and all, but if you live with her, you know what I'm living with.So, I got off the 1 train to Broadway & 103th St., out of the 104th street exit and walked over to my beloved Silver Moon Bakery. Well, as I took photos of the place (see below) I noticed that most of their lights were off. I mean, the bakers and employees are all working but I realized that I'm there too darn early! I looked at my watch and it's 7 AM.Great. I thought to myself, \"What the heck am I going to do?\" I just decided to walk uptown. As I just walk pass the locals who are in their business suits, the joggers and dog owners. I've realized that Riverside Park was nearby so, I just walked westward and took some nature pics.After taking in some nature and I've had it with the numerous dogs coming into the park, I walked back to Silver Moon. By the time I've reached there, my watch says it's 7:30 but there were four other people, besides me waiting outside their door. While I was waiting and being the only possibly strange person out of the group to take a photo of their menu of the day.When I saw on the list \"Apricot Hazelnut Parisienne,\" I just remembered about the whole list of stuff I should eat from the local woman I talked to last week. I automatically thought to myself, \"It's mine! All mine!\" plus the croissant and pumpkin chocolate chip muffin I want to eat for breakfast.As I (and the other locals) saw an employee unlock and open the door, we all scrambled in to get first dibs on their freshly baked goods. As I said earlier, I ordered the Apricot Hazelnut Parisienne ($4), Plain Croissant ($1.85), and the Pumpkin Chocolate Muffin ($2.40); total $8.25. Yeah, it's pretty darn pricey but it's totally worth it! Partly because it's my breakfast and lunch and the quality is superb, as you will read on.But first, the one of the many photos of the bakery's baked goods':If you want to see more photos of the bakery, click here. Just go to the upper right hand corner to see a slideshow.The first thing I ate was the plain croissant.Isn't it a thing of beauty? Perfectly golden brown exterior, buttery aroma, it has the crisp shatter effect from the slightest pressure. Oh, I'm getting excited! (Hey, I love food. If you don't have any feelings for food, you don't love food; you're just eating for the sake of eating. One must appreciate the effort those bakers/chefs/cooks put into their product and if it's good and exquisite, then it's worth loving the product, the baker/chef/cook, and possibly the institution of where you bought that product).Sorry about the sidetrack, I just need to get that out of my chest since some people think I'm strange (in person) the way I react to food. Back to the croissant. When I tear this beautiful, buttery pastry, it sang it's brittle shatter song along with the sounds of thick broken glass, with the fall of thin, delicate shards of it's flaky exterior. The moment I bite into the croissant, it had the shatter at the bite and it was actually very light in texture. I'm delightfully surprised because the woman I spoke to said it was dense. Hmm...anyways, it was (as I said) light, delicate and it had the faint creamy hint of butter flavor. I have to say this is one of the best croissants I've ever eaten in my entire life! J'adore! C'est magnifique!Next up, the pumpkin chocolate chip muffin.When I took it out of the bag it was still warm, as in just baked 10 minutes ago warm! I'm very happy about this because of the copious amounts of muffins that I have eaten outside of my home, I rarely encounter a warm muffin. Given to this unexpected factor, my initial thoughts about this muffin was going to be something extraordinary or close to greatness. The dark golden brown, orange-hued exterior with the gooey chocolate chips looks very appetizing. When I grabbed a plastic knife and start cutting it in half, I heard the crisp, crunchy exterior sound. I haven't hear that sound in any muffin that I have tried that isn't homemade...my anticipation is building. There's even distribution of chocolate chips to muffin; very good. Moist interior, getting better. After I quartered the muffin (so I could hold and eat it) I took a bite; the crisp, crunchy exterior meshes with the soft, moist crumb (interior) makes it texturally pleasing to my mouth. It tastes like pumpkin, but not the hearty, spice laden pumpkin. It's more light and floral in flavor, delicately balanced with a hint of cloves and the lightest touch of cinnamon; it's almost undetectable, which I think is a good thing. My mind is giggling in delight eating this great (not good, great) muffin.The last but certainly not least, the apricot hazelnut parisienne bread.It's a beautiful batard shaped loaf of bread. It has a very crisp exterior that it also has it's own song, in reference to a recently published NY Magazine article about baguettes. It smells wonderful; predominantly a sour-yeasty scent with a faint hint of nuts. The interior crumb is moist and it has the irregular holes (a good sign of artisanal bread). The flavor is yeasty, slightly sweet and chewy from the apricots, and the earthy, nutty, crunchiness from the hazelnuts brings an the contrasting flavors and textures to the bread. I love it! As I eat this bread, I'm thinking of pairing it cheese. Mmm...cheese; probably something creamy and light in flavor. A young cheese like brie or a fronage d'affinois (don't know that cheese? Click here.) would go very well with this bread.Coming back to Earth (mentally) after spacing out into my own sphere of bread and pastries, I realized people are start packing in this bakery.Well, that's pretty much what happened in Silver Moon. I will definitely come back here to try more of their stuff. I wonder how good are their cakes. Hmm...maybe next time. I still have my loaf of bread unfinished.

I Think I Found My Dream Home (...Bakery, actually)

Being a huge sugar/pastry/chocolate addict of sorts I think I have found the bakery of my dreams. The place I'm talking about is Silver Moon Bakery located at 2740 Broadway. Yeah, it's waay up there in the Upper West Side. I went there once a few years ago before I reached my epiphany with food and underestimated the quality and goodness this establishment has. All I remembered that it was good but I didn't remembered how good it was.Since I was doing research for fabulously great muffins from a suggestion from one of the commenters, I wracked my brains and remembered I went to Silver Moon and try out their stuff again. I got there pretty much at opening time at 7:40 AM on Thursday morning. It took me a good 3-5 minutes to make up my mind what the heck I wanna eat! There's so many good looking pastries, bread, etc. that I was undecisive! Eventually, I settled for a blueberry scone ($2.40), a chocolate chip brioche ($2.45) and a small coffee (forgot how much) with tax comes out $6.55.The bakery itself is large but the seating area is very small, only two tables with chairs and a high table next to the bread racks that has no chairs whatsoever. Only during the sunny, warm days they have tables outside but that Thursday morning, it was raining. So, I parked myself and my food on the high table. So, here's the food porn:That's for my breakfast and lunch, ok? So it's arguably calorically reasonable. Just forget the fat content thing so my conscience won't get the best of me.The blueberry scone was still warm when I actually start breaking it apart for photos. It had a crisp exterior and a soft, flaky crumb interior. It bordered between moist and dry for the interior and the flavor of the scone had a small amount of blueberry and there's actually visible specks of orange zest in them, which was a nice surprise. It's not bad but it's not the best scone. Eh, I'm still searching for the best scone.The coffee was good and strong. But it's more like a bright, acidic flavor than dark, bold and robust.The chocolate chip brioche is very soft and buttery from the feel of it, when I broke it apart. It's sandwiched a good bittersweet (70%) chocolate. It's not very sweet. The only sweetness it has is lended from the sugar crystals on the top, as well as the crunch. It's pretty damn good.Ooh, I should mention this. After I took pics of the food and started to nibble my scone and scribble down my notes about this scone, an older local woman (possibly in her 40s) wanted to take a small share of my table and I let her do so. She had a fruit yogurt and coffee. I felt kind of guilty from eating all that is buttery and sweet, while she has something modestly healthy.Anyways, she saw my snapping photos and she asked me, \"Are you a tourist?\"I replied to her softly, \"Not really.\" (I'm a tourist to the Upper West Side but not a tourist to NYC) \"I just write a food blog.\"She said, \"You write a what?\"I said, \"A food blog.\"She said, \"Oh.\"A few silent moments passed while we're both eating our breakfast items when she started to talk to me again. This time she commented about my scone. She said the apricot scone is a lot more moist than the blueberry, which she finds it dry. Then she started to suggest me things that she claims that are fabulously delicious and good.She recommended the:When I asked her what would she recommend on the muffins (I'm doing research on that item), she said, \"They have a great pumpkin chocolate chip muffin. And it's seasonal.\"I replied to her, \"I love seasonal foods.\" I tend to eat seasonal anyways.Also when I asked about their croissants since I saw there were trays on display of them, she replied that \"they're (the croissants) are very dense and buttery, very Parisian type of croissants; not very flaky. I've tried almost everything in this bakery and they're really good.\"So, with that in mind (and in my book) I will try their stuff whenever I'm in their neighborhood or whenever I'm having a huge carbohydrate, baked good craving. I truly think I have found my new favorite bakery, I think it would be almost the same passion as the woman I spoke to has. The major problem is that I have to trek uptown to get some of their bread and pastries. Well I can't always have everything, and I can't afford to live uptown so I'll journey up there if I have to. Probably the staff of Silver Moon will recognize me as the weeks goes on...

I've been meaning to try Silver Moon, but never got around to it!  Argh!PUMPKIN MUFFIN OH MY GOD I WANT.  I expect to read your review of it!  And the croissant!  Yes.

My Bread Baking Day(s) & Homemade Hot Chocolate....

Ahhh...the relieved feeling of getting over all of my stinking midterms. It just feels like I just went over the highest peak of the roller coaster ride and I'm falling free...(not my grades I hope, but so far so good). Anyways, taking advantage of my ever ephemeral freedom of studying, I baked for the past 1 1/2 days. Technically it's one early morning of baking but it's just that I started the process of mixing, proofing, shaping, and proofing again before I actually baked in the morn. Also, I'm baking for my own (early - next Thursday) birthday and I can't bake next weekend because of more tests and papers...So yeah, I'm turning 21 believe it or not. Most of my friends incredulously react to the fact that I'm going to be 21 because they think I'm older by the way I behave. I've accepted the fact that I behave years beyond my age ever since I was a child - never been taught to act that way, but I guess it's the way my parents reared me and how I react to society in general.Anyways, forget what I was talking about age and socio-psychological stuff; let's talk about food or bread at least. As I mentioned earlier, I baked bread. I'm a huge fan of Rose Levy Beranbaum's book, The Bread Bible. The recipe I often refer to and bake for every holiday (for the past 3 years) for my family from her book is the Cinnamon Raisin Loaf. The other recipe I baked is from the Smitten Kitchen's Orange Chocolate Bread recipe from her bread baking class at ICE.I made Rose's bread recipe my own by replacing the cinnamon with a chocolate paste (Valhrona cocoa powder, granulated sugar, orange extract, and butter) for one loaf and the other is just plain ol' raisin and also replaced some of the water needed in the dough with a couple of tablespoons of orange flower water. When it came to the chocolate bread recipe, it's really unusual and appealing to me because 1) I love chocolate and 2) it's bread; not quick bread and it's not cake. In all, it's a good experiment for me try.So, after reading through both recipes, I have almost all of the ingredients but the cocoa powder. Yeah, it's hard to believe that a chocolate lover would not have cocoa powder in her own house but I live in a mostly non-chocolate loving home. See the problem? Oh, I should mention, when I told my parents that I'm planning to bake the chocolate bread, they were skeptical. They said, \"Chocolate bread?! I never tried or heard of it before.\" Hence, my parents haven't exactly reached the foodie stage yet...probably if they ever want to go to Manhattan, I'll take them to Amy's Bread and introduce to them the chocolate cherry bread.On Thursday morning, I ventured out to the Upper West Side to do two things: 1) Eat breakfast at a great bakery (that I'll write about next week). I need to do more research (read: eat more of their breads and pastries) and 2) Go to either Zabar's or Fairway for some cocoa powder - Valhrona that is. Eventually, I bought it from Fairway; it's cheaper (paid for $8.99 for 8.8 oz) and also I bought a small chunk of Callebaut bittersweet chocolate (a little more than $2; I forgotten how much it cost per pound) for my homemade lavender hot chocolate (more on that later).During evening around 7:30 PM, my mom wanted to eat the bread during the morning, when I already told her that my plan was to bake and eat the bread after dinner. After having a small argument over this, she won. The problem is that it's 7:30 PM and that means in order for me to bake everything by 7 AM, I have to mix and proof everything before I get to bed. That means, I'm going to sleep at 12 AM, which actually happened. Some of the pics on the bread making process:Mixing of the raisin bread base.Post proofings of the chocolate bread.Post proofings of the chocolate swirled raisin bread.If you want to see the entire process (almost all) of how I mixed and kneaded and whatnot to both doughs, you may see (temporarily; I'm using a trial for now, ending on 11/17) the photo album I created for the bread making process.View album at PixagogoOr you may View the album at Fotki after that time.Woe to my lack of sleep (like I don't anyways, because of college?), I got up at 5:30 AM and start cranking up the oven (preheating) and made coffee for my dad and I, and tea for my mom. Even though I'm half awake, the bread came out beautifully.By the time my first loaf came out, the chocolate swirled raisin bread, my mom shouted to my dad to get out of bed and eat breakfast - all the bread loaves.The resulting photos of the baked breads:Chocolate swirled raisin bread: It's very soft and tender crumb, sweet but not overly sweet, the chocolate paste (or swirl) has the great dark, complex chocolate flavor that is the characteristic of Valhrona chocolate and the orange extract that I added into the paste gave it some bright, citrusy flavor.The problem with baking all of these delicious loaves, is that my family and I have to finish them within a day or two (the max). Basically, I'm stuffing my face with bread today for two meals. Not that it tastes bad but my stomach can't handle that much bread. Pretty much I ate about a half a pound of bread today. I wish my younger brother was here to help out. Unfortunately, he's upstate in college. Damn and it's too expensive to do overnight express to ship it out to him.As I said before, I bought Callebaut chocolate also a few organic marshmallows from Whole Foods for my lavender hot chocolate. The dried lavender was bought almost a year ago for my lavender shortbread cookies for my Christmas cookie baking/gift-giving.Most of my ingredients for the lavender hot chocolate.It's partly inspired from Vosges Haut Chocolat's Bianca Hot Chocolate but it's just dark, bittersweet chocolate instead of white chocolate; also without the citrus flavors that's originally there. I don't really love white chocolate because it's not real chocolate and I usually find it too sweet for my palate. I just like to decorate cakes with white chocolate.I don't have a real recipe of sorts, it's basically a mixture of the Valhrona unsweetened cocoa powder, a little bit of granulated sugar, whole milk, a tiny bit of dried lavender flowers, water, and some of the bittersweet Callebaut chocolate I bought from Fairway, grated. I basically infused the lavender flavor by simmering it in a small saucepan of milk for 5 minutes. Turn it off, strain out the flowers and set it aside. Get all the chocolates and sugar prepared, dump all of the dry ingredients together with the milk in the same saucepan and heat it up until all of the sugar and chocolate is dissolved.As you can see in the photos, it's pretty darn dark and thick. It has a faint but distinct flavor of lavender with the dark, rich chocolate flavor. Put in a marshmallow into a cup of hot chocolate...I'm in heaven.Whisking away my hot chocolate to smoothness.If you want to see more photos on the hot chocolate, click here:Album at PixagogoOr you may click here if the above link expired.I might go to a bakery or try a slice of Michel Cluziel's chocolate cake. I don't want to bake a cake because it's well, it's a bit boring to me and I like baking bread a lot more to understand the philosophy of patience and putting love into the bread (not like I don't do it for all of my cooking and baking). I just feel more relaxed baking bread. Chocolate is just my outlet to sublime bliss.Probably the day of my birthday, I'll just go to a wine bar or a restaurant and get a glass of wine or maybe a cocktail. Hey, I'm finally legal; it's just that I'm not the loud, rowdy, party type of person.

First of all to everyone:May your new year be filled with good food, good memories, and lots of happiness. Just don't drink too much folks or you're greeted with one ugly hangover...Ok, the party. The title's really based on that idea of a fusion of all those holidays, since (as you read on) Kim's celebrating a belated Christmas and all the holidays that has or will be taking place within a day or less (depending upon when you're reading this).This party took place in Kim's home in Long Beach. The problem is that I'm a city girl and I never took the LIRR train my entire life! I took the subway and bus countless times but the train? I'm totally lost. Some issues getting there: the bus from my house to the Jamaica station took 20 minutes to arrive and I was actually getting paranoid being late! Just because the train arrives only once every hour. I constantly kept looking at my watch whenever the driver makes a stop and I kept thinking \"Keep driving! Keep driving, dammit!\" So yeah, my nerves were really getting fried.When I finally arrived to the station and actually took a deep breath and mentally prepared myself that everything's going to be fine. I bought a roundtrip off-peak ticket to Long Beach and waited for the next train to arrive...and that was 50 minutes. Oy. So I went to the track where my train's supposed to be located at and looked around if anyone I knew is there. I didn't see anyone, and out of bordem/panic, I called the hostess, Kim. She told me on the phone that I'm supposed to see 2 people. However, I'm lingering around like a fool wondering where the hell are they? What I did to kill some time, I just took photos of the station. Somehow the steel beams and arches appeal to me, I don't know why...Finally, within 5 minutes before the train arrived, I saw Dave on the platform. I just remembered his face and just said, \"Hi\" but I forgot his name. (I'm not really good with names with people who I don't see so often; sorry). Anyways, we rode the train that take us to Long Beach and it wasn't so bad. It's so much cleaner than the subways, it's above the ground, and the ride wasn't so painfully long as I thought it would be.Once we arrived to Long Beach, we got picked up by Kim and her significant other, Matt, and they drove us to their lovely home. We found out on the car ride that we're the only ones who were on time. *sighs* In ways, this wasn't surprising yet I felt a bit peeved but I got over it once I saw the food! Yes; I was hungry and it was about 1:30 P.M. and I ate breakfast at 6 AM.Kim granted us permission to nosh on her hors d'oeuvers (appetizers). Take a look below:Also, another friend of her's that we knew mutually was Eno.I found out that she stayed overnight to give a helping hand to Kim. I'm so proud of Kim and Eno because Kim taught Eno how to cook! Hopefully, Eno remembered a few things and actually cook for herself. I also found out that Eno, Kim and Matt stayed up to 4 AM to finish off the cooking. I just felt terrible for them. So, the problems of late guests kept rolling in...one group was about an hour to 1 1/2 hours late and another was two hours late . But we still kept noshing on the appetizers that she set out and laughing at every phone call, especially the extremely late group's calls, since Kim put it on speaker phone. I haven't laughed that hard for a long time.The latecomers eventually came in about 2 hours... I'm hesitant about putting the latecomers faces on this post just because I don't want to but this section as a \"late comers section of shame.\" So, let's go to the funnier stuff and yes, the food will come in a bit later. Ok?As all the guests finally arrived and got settled in, Kim started to take photos and film us on her video camera. She wanted everyone to stand up and sing \"Kumbaya.\" She mentioned that she wanted everyone to sing that song earlier before most of the guests arrived, and all of us thought she was joking. The one who really repulsed by this was her boyfriend, Matt. As you can see in his expression:Eventually he caved in, since he was pressured by Kim and the video camera she's holding. He just sang the chorus line of \"Kumbaya\" in a different note. But hey, bravo for doing it since everyone else didn't have the guts to sing it. After that crazy phase, Kim made everyone to do some kind of dance in order to get our food. Since no one wanted to dance, only a few people started to do their own \"dance\" moves by doing some kind of arm movement that was very odd and hilarious. Just look below.Shirley's eating up and talking...Moving on... after we ate, Kim gave out presents to everyone. All's happy and giddy with them. I would post more photos, but this is a food blog; just go toward the end and you'll see a link for more photos. After that, we all got our coats on and have a walk to the beach! Yay! We're walking out in 30-something degrees weather and it's breezy too! Woo hoo...! Well, the chilly part isn't so bad. I just started to tear up a bit (because it's cold and breezy) after standing out for 5 minutes. I tried to take photos in the near dark setting; it didn't come out too well. But it looks interesting and something similar to De Chirico's paintings: the use of shadows and the playing of light...if you studied Art History, you know what I mean.As we walked back to Kim's place, we had dessert! Those of you who know me, I never miss out on dessert. So we had:And last but not least...Also from that same article it stated that, \"In the last essay of \"Home Cooking: A Writer in the Kitchen,\" Colwin wrote, \"Black Cake, like truffles and vintage Burgundy, is deep, complicated and intense. It has taste and aftertaste. It demands to be eaten in a slow, meditative way.\" I have to concur with that last statement because after I bit that cake, I actually tasted the caramel flavors with the sweetness of the dried fruits in the cake. The booze factor wasn't really there. I can tell because I really have low tolerance for alcohol. I mean, after a glass of wine I'm a bit buzzed there.If you want to see more photos about this party, click here.

You're welcome, Kim! Actually, thanks for the party. Sorry about the misnomer on the chicken. Errr...could you not spike the food (unless you're cooking with it; it's fine with me since you're burning most of the alcohol away)? I know I'll turn terribly red and probably pass out than actually talk stupid.

hey, a late update, the Black Cake we make for Christmas seems to be a version of English Plum Pudding. I had a suspicion so I checked up a bunch of traditional English recipes and most of the ingredients are the same. I have yet to taste it to really see the difference ( but I bet the Trini Black Cake will trump the Pudding anyway :)

The Best Muffin in NYC Goes To...?

Notes: I know this is a post that I've spoken about ages ago that I should've written but I was lazy. Sorry. It's better late than never. This may be a good way to start the new year by knowing where to get your morning muffin. (End note)Hmm...you have to read it out to know the answer. Yes... you have to read out my rants and raves of who's the best, superb muffin to who just got the most awful thing I put in my mouth that doesn't deserve to have the name, muffin. I would call it garbage, slop,...you get the point.It's very sad and disturbing that in New York City, the muffin is ubiquitous as the bagel or croissant; has a very wide range of palatability from the offensively bad to the fabulously good. It partly explains why it took me a while to come up with this list and I have to tell you, it's been a hard and long journey for my stomach and my taste buds.To start off, my ideal muffin has to have a slightly crisp, crunchy exterior with a moist, soft crumb (interior). Flavors do not particularly matter, as long as it's a sweet-type not savory (even though I don't have any problem eating a bacon, cheddar and chive muffin but I like sweet muffins more) and the flavor of the fruit (if any) shines through with a good balance of spices (once again, if any). An example of my ideal muffin, is the one I baked two weeks ago, an adaptation of Martha Stewart's blueberry muffin but made with orange zest and cranberries. Seen below...The rating system is the same as all of my \"best of...\" posts; 1 being the worst to 4 the best.I'll do this in chronologically eaten order...Bouchon Bakery's Banana Nut Muffin $2.75 w/tax = $2.99; other flavors that we're available that day were carrot (cake?) muffin, and a savory-type muffin (can't recall the name), neither of which appealed to me so banana nut it is. The muffin looks good: a dry, crumbly, streusel-like topping, peaking out is a nice shade of golden brown, and bits of nuts popping out. The interior is soft, moist with a good amount of chopped nuts, probably walnuts? I can't distinguish it too well since it's chopped. It smells wonderful; bananas with delicate scents of banana, cinnamon and cloves. When I took a bite, the crunch of the streusel and nuts is a great contrast to the soft, delicate, and moist interior - almost cake-like in texture. The nuts impart a slightly bitter, earthy flavor goes well with the banana's dense fruity flavor and the streusel also helps in the flavor department by also flavored with banana and noticeably, butter. It's a very good muffin. Rating: 3.5 out of 4.Whole Foods' Banana Nut muffin (I ate the same flavor the same day; from the 3rd floor where Bouchon's located to the basement: Whole Foods ($1.89)). It looks a lot more prominently mushroom-shaped than Bouchon's; there's a lot more chopped walnuts sprinkled on top, the muffin's top is moist, and it's greasy on the bottom. After cutting it in half, it's moist throughout and there a good bit of black walnuts distributed throughout the muffin. When it comes to taste and texture, the banana flavor is really lacking - practically bland; there was the slight bitterness from the walnuts, but it is moist. Rating: 2 out of 4.Petrossian Café was something out of expectation that they would have some great muffins since they do have a reputation for being a purveyor of expensive, fabulous foods (i.e. caviar). So, in hopes of finding a great muffin, I purchased their apple muffin ($2).It looks decent from the dry exterior that I wanted and it had the streusel-like topping. It smelled faintly of cinnamon. So I took a deep breath and bit it. Well, it was just borderline moist that it wasn't dry, not much apple flavor but I can taste the cinnamon, and there were some apple chunks. It was not a great muffin. I probably had too much high expectations for this establishment, that made me have biases on this muffin. But still, it's not the best muffin. Rating: 2.5 out of 4.Now, this is a mini-tour around the Grand Central Station area, since this is where many commuters come and go to the city. I began my search in the Dining Concourse area at Dishes. Why I chose this particular place? It's because they were the only food establishment besides Junior's that was selling any breakfast food at 6:50 AM. Anyways, I perused their pastry case and I spotted Yura & Co.'s muffins, so I bought Yura's Apple Walnut Muffin ($2.75).It's quite a large muffin with the \"mushroom\" top. It's a moist muffin, densely packed with walnuts, chunks of apples, raisins and walnuts. The muffin tasted good: sweet (from the raisins and apples), moist, good apple-cinnamon flavor.The drawback was that it's soft throughout the muffin; lacked that thin crust exterior. Rating: 3 out of 4. Probably it would be better if I went straight to the source, at Yura & Co. in the Upper East Side? I'll give it a whirl in the future.Next up, Cipriani Le Specialita. Once again, a well known name and I had high expectations for this establishment. I entered this small but swanky establishment with high hopes for a really good muffin. I ordered a blueberry muffin for $1.My first problem is, where's the rest of it? It's just a dainty, little muffin about 1 1/2 inches in diameter. Other issues: it's barely moist, the blueberries in that muffin are insipid, not sweet and it lacked that crunchy exterior.This little muffin needs a lot of help. Rating: 1.5 out of 4.Zaro's Bakery located in Grand Central Market was bustling with the morning commute activity, many where there for their muffins. Taking that implication, I joined the crowd and gotten myself an orange cranberry muffin for $1.85. This muffin is not at all dainty like Cipriani's; it's really huge. Take a look:I guess their size took over the whole concept of taste. The muffin was moist with a decent crusty exterior from the sugar, but there wasn't much cranberries, the orange flavor tasted really *gasp* artificial - almost taste like something out of a cake/muffin mix. I know! It's hard to believe but it really does. After that initial bite, I lost my appetite and threw it in the garbage. It was an insult to my stomach that I almost felt like vomiting. Rating: 1 out of 4.Getting out of that area (thankfully), I went to the west side to Le Pain Quotidien and ordered their organic blueberry muffin ($2.25). It looks a lot more like a real muffin with it's natural unevenness.The muffin looks like there's tons of blueberries but once I split that muffin, there's barely any. I really liked the crunchy exterior and the moist interior crumb, it's not very sweet and it's a very wholesome muffin from the whole grains I tasted from the bite. It tastes good. Rating: 3 out of 4.I trekked to the Upper West Side to Silver Moon Bakery. Those of you who've read the post about this place, I'm completely enamored with this bakery. I have tried their pumpkin chocolate chip (more like chunk) muffin for $2.40.It just came out of the oven minutes ago, since I went at the time they opened the doors to the bakery. The chocolate was still hot and gooey from the remaining heat from the muffin and it had a nicely browned exterior. I'm anticipating greatness from this muffin. When I bit it, the crust was very crisp, contrasting the soft, moist interior; it had a good pumpkin flavor with a hints of clove, allspice, and cinnamon. From looking at the photo with the halved muffin, it had an even distribution of chocolate throughout the muffin. I LOVE this muffin. I was actually giddy when I ate this muffin, that I almost giggled with happiness that some of the bakery's patrons were looking at me like I'm weird or crazy. Rating: 3.75 out of 4.Out in Dumbo, Brooklyn, I went to Almondine. I went for their bran muffin ($1.95) that morning, for some reason I opted out their raspberry muffin. I still don't know why I did.Anyways, it wasn't a bad choice. It's a fresh, wholesome muffin; not greasy. It had a slight crusty exterior with a moist crumb; filled with lots of raisins and an unexpected dried apricot. It also had a toothsome texture from the bran with a hint sweetness from the dried fruits and nuttiness from the bran. The crust wasn't as crisp as Silver Moon's, probably because it was raining that day. Rating: 3.3 out of 4.Back to the city; I went to City Bakery for their blueberry corn muffin ($2.50). I've read from various Chowhound posts that this particular muffin is good.First off, it's not the typical \"mushroom\" shaped muffin, it's more disk-like. It had a thin, crusty exterior but the main problem is that this muffin is terribly greasy. The muffin does have even distribution of blueberries and one can see the cornmeal specks throughout the muffin. It has the contrast of crisp crust with the soft, moist interior with a fresh burst of blueberry flavor. The cornmeal gives the it an extra toothsome texture and the crumb is really soft and buttery. This muffin is a bit too decadent for me as a breakfast item but it's decent. Rating: 3 out of 4.I went over to Zabar's Café in the Upper West Side and tried their babka muffin. To tell you honestly, I don't know what to expect from the muffin: would it be more of a babka shaped like a muffin or is a muffin that tastes like a babka?Well, it's certainly a dry muffin or babka, if anything. It's packed with lots of dried fruits but it's not what I desire from a muffin and as a babka perspective, it's not floating my boat, either. If I'm rating this as a muffin, it's too dry, the texture is too dense but the sweetness factor is fine. I have other personal faves for babka but that's a totally different post. This muffin is having an identity crisis that I can't really rate it.Next up, I went to Amy's Bread in Chelsea Market during the afternoon for a snack. During that day, I had my lunch earlier. I ordered their apricot date muffin for $2.25.It doesn't look too tempting, honestly. It doesn't have the crisp crust that I wanted (partly because it was the afternoon), the interior crumb was a bit dry and a tiny bit dense/tough; but at least it had a good bit of chopped dates and it has good flavor of apricots and dates. Rating: 2.5 out of 4.And finally, from Two Little Red Hens in the Upper East Side. I had their pumpkin muffin for $2; yes, it's the one I've spoken a tiny bit about it a few weeks ago. It came out hot out of the oven that morning. It was wonderfully light, crisp, and slightly sweet and savory (from the pumpkin and spices), all in one bite. It was a brief moment of bliss. This is one fine muffin. Rating: 3.75 out of 4.To sum it all up in a list:1. It's really tough, it's a toss up between:Two Little Red Hens1652 2nd AveNew York, NY(it also has a Brooklyn location that is just as fine, located at 1112 8th Ave. Brooklyn, NY)Silver Moon Bakery2740 BroadwayNew York, NYBouchon Bakery10 Columbus Circle (on the 3rd Floor)New York, NY2. Almondine85 Water StBrooklyn, NY3. tied between:Bought in Dishes in Grand Central Dining Concourse but the source is Yura & Co.1645 3rd Ave.New York, NYLe Pain Quotidienvisited 922 7th AveNew York, NY (but there's multiple locations throughout the city)City Bakery3 W 18th StNew York, NY4. Amy's Bread3 locations in Manhattanvisited the one in Chelsea's Market: 672 9th Ave. New York, NY5. Whole Foodsvarious locations throughout the city but I visited the one in Columbus Circle.Don't bother with:Zaro's visited: 89 E 42nd StNew York, NYCipriani Le Specialita110 E 42nd StNew York, NYHonorable mention: Blue Sky Bakery in 53 5th Ave in Brooklyn. I had their blueberry muffin about a year ago and I remembered it was quite good and also it had praises over at Chowhound as well.It seems to me there seems to be better muffins toward the Upper East and Upper West Side. Too bad I don't live on either spots, I just commute to the Upper West Side for school. Bummer.Hopefully, most of you may find this list resourceful. I know some of you might have some qualms with this list but this is just my opinion. If you do like some places that I'm dismissing, you may just ignore me.I also know a lot more places out in Brooklyn that has some great muffins as well, but I just don't have the time or stomach capacity.To see the whole photoset of this list, click here.'Til then, I hope you may have better muffins starting the new year (since it's Thursday anyway and probably you're reading this while you're at work). But of course, the best muffins are homemade; unless you don't know how to bake.

Thanks so much for testing out the muffins!  I agree that Zaro's sucks.  Everything I've had there tastes artificial.I had a really good muffin at Financier.  There was a crisp crust and a pound cake/scone-like crumb.  Not too sweet.  I think it's the perfect size because it's not Costco-sized.

You are ACCOMPLISHED!!! :) Man, I wish I was there to muffin test everything with you! Of all the bakeries you visited, Silver Moon is a definte favorite of mine - I've never had anything bad there and oh man, the chocolate brioche when it's still warm? Like magic! I swear, it's the most buttery chocolately heavenly creation. Especially when you have it right after you get out of a midterm! hehe, enjoy your new years! :)

Jessica - You're welcome! I probably give Financier's muffin a try. I usually their macarons.Kathy - Aw, no I'm not accomplished. Just accomplishing a slightly rounder stomach. But I really love Silver Moon Bakery, hence why I've written that they're my \"new home.\" Happy New Year to you, too! :)

Hi, have you tried Dumbo muffins? It's sold at quite a few cafes in midtown east & upper east side. These are the \"healthier\" version which is supposedly 97% fat free. Also i thought GiGi catering has pretty good lemon poppy seed muffin (when it's toasted)

Thank you *so* very much for all your muffin research! This is a fantastic post-quite informative.  I agree with you on Two Little Red Hens.  Superb muffins and baked goods. Fortunately for me (although not my waistline) I  live in the TLRH 'hood !  Cheers.

[...] The cheapest place for Frogurt (only $2.50) is at Zabar's Cafe, but it's all the way on the Upper West Side, and they close at 7:00 P.M. While you're there, you can also try the frozen custard, but never order the babka muffin, which wins the award for driest muffin. [...]

Merry Christmas everyone! I hope your Christmas is going well so far, especially the food. Well, today's Christmas dinner menu is basically a variation of the surf-n-turf: seared steak (done the most austere way: just salt and pepper; done by my father), steamed asparagus, sauteed mushrooms (vegetables done by my mom), and my homemade raisin coconut walnut bread and coconut shrimp.If you're wondering about my younger brother; he's just here for the food. In ways it's a good thing because my house doesn't have a huge kitchen and it's already bad enough that there's three people making their own things and we just have one stove. So yeah, it's good that he doesn't cook.I don't have pictures of the main courses, just the stuff I made since: 1) the photos of the entrées and the side dishes didn't come out too well and 2) once the food came out that my parents made, were consumed almost immediately. Sorry.Homemade Raisin Coconut Walnut Bread - Loaf shapeHomemade Raisin Coconut Walnut Bread - Shaped in a bun-like formYes, my family and I stuffed our faces with lots of food. Not to mention, we still have the cheesecake I made yesterday.So, my question to you readers, what did you eat for Christmas? Did you make anything special or partake in the process of creating the meal?'Til then, Merry Christmas! As for tomorrow, may you have many happy returns for any gifts that you don't like and/or happy shopping!

Merry Christmas & A Happy New Year! Joyeux Noël et bonne année! ¡Feliz Navidad y próspero año nuevo! Buon Natale e felice anno nuovo! Fröhliches Weihnachten! Vrolijk Kerstmis! 聖誕節同新年快樂 ! Hyvää joulua ja onnellista uutta vuotta! クリスマスと新年おめでとうございます! Wesołych Świąt! 메리 크리스마스! 새해 복 많이 받으세요! God jul och gott nytt år! Feliz Natal! Happy Hanukkah! (the last day, I believe?) and שנה טובה! And last but not least, Happy Kwanzaa! (starting on Dec. 26th)Hopefully, I've written those \"Merry Christmas!\" sayings correctly, if I didn't I apologize. For the curious, it started (obviously) from English then, French, Spanish, Italian, German, Dutch, Finnish, Japanese, Polish, Korean (also said \"happy new year\"), Swedish, and Portuguese. I would write more but it's getting redundant. Don't you agree?My family is not the traditional set who would have Christmas morning bread (that was last year); so my mother proposed that I will have to bake a cheesecake ready to be consumed by Christmas eve morning. I know. I live in a strange family who would have a deliriously rich dessert for breakfast. A few years ago my family trekked down to Flatbush Ave. in Brooklyn for the famous Junior's Cheesecake. We find that it even though it was delicious, the long wait and a albeit, a bit pricey to get a cheesecake the size that I'm baking was not worth the trip again.Obliging to my mom's orders, I started it yesterday since the cheesecake needs to be chilled a good few hours after the 1 1/2 hours of baking and two to three hours to cool off.The mixer...I have to thank Kim (again) for this lovely mixer! It was totally unexpected of her to give me as a Christmas present. The funny thing is that she read my post (months earlier) about my whole campaign for my mom to buy me a stand mixer for years; now Kim's giving this for me instead. I was touched that she and her significant other schlepped the huge box from Long Beach to my house in Queens. I'm getting spoiled...(and she saved my arm from a major fatigue creaming the cream cheese.)Anyways, I'm just giving you the highlights of baking this cheesecake. My favorite part was the crust making. Do you want to know why? It's because it great stress relief; take a look:Sorry...I'm just frustrated (I have issues, ok?)Moving on...mixing the cheesecake filling.Pouring mixed filling & the crust:Baked cheesecake:Cooled cheesecake on a cake plate:Cheesecake with the raspberries.It's decadent, delicious, and luxuriously rich. Probably there should be a surgeon general's warning that this cheesecake is ridiculously high in saturated fats, cholesterol (the bad ones, LDL), and high in calories but who cares? It's the holidays, live a little. Bake a cheesecake and just have a tiny piece and slowly peck your way through the week or throw a cheesecake party and invite a few people over to enjoy this wonderful cheesecake.Here's the recipe...Raspberry CheesecakeBarefoot Contessa Family Style by Ina GartenFor the crust:1 1/2 cups graham cracker crumbs (10 crackers)1 tablespoon sugar6 tablespoons (3/4 stick) unsalted butter, meltedFor the filling:2 1/2 pounds cream cheese, at room temperature1 1/2 cups sugar5 whole extra-large eggs, at room temperature2 extra-large egg yolks, at room temperature1/4 cup sour cream1 tablespoon grated lemon zest (2 lemons)1 1/2 teaspoons pure vanilla extractFor the topping:1 cup red jelly (not jam), such as currant, raspberry, or strawberry3 half-pints fresh raspberriesPreheat the oven to 350 degrees F.To make the crust, combine the graham crackers, sugar, and melted butter until moistened. Pour into a 9-inch springform pan. With your hands, press the crumbs into the bottom of the pan and about 1-inch up the sides. Bake for 8 minutes. Cool to room temperature.Raise the oven temperature to 450 degrees F.To make the filling, cream the cream cheese and sugar in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a paddle attachment on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Reduce the speed of the mixer to medium and add the eggs and egg yolks, 2 at a time, mixing well. Scrape down the bowl and beater, as necessary. With the mixer on low, add the sour cream, lemon zest, and vanilla. Mix thoroughly and pour into the cooled crust.Bake for 15 minutes. Turn the oven temperature down to 225 degrees F and bake for another 1 hour and 15 minutes. Turn the oven off and open the door wide. The cake will not be completely set in the center. Allow the cake to sit in the oven with the door open for 30 minutes. Take the cake out of the oven and allow it to sit at room temperature for another 2 to 3 hours, until completely cooled. Wrap and refrigerate overnight.Remove the cake from the springform pan by carefully running a hot knife around the outside of the cake. Leave the cake on the bottom of the springform pan for serving.To make the topping, melt the jelly in a small pan over low heat. In a bowl, toss the raspberries and the warm jelly gently until well mixed. Arrange the berries on top of the cake. Refrigerate until ready to serve.Note: Measure your springform pan. The bottom of mine measures 9 inches, but it says 9 1/2. I put the springform pan on a sheet pan before putting it in the oven to catch any leaks.Once again, Happy Holidays! Have fun: eat, drink and be merry! Just do it in moderation.

It's not really a food posting of sorts. It's more like food photos of the confections that I've purchased ever since Tuesday, 12/19 from Takashimaya, Minimoto Kitchoan, and Chocolat Michel Cluizel.Somehow I've managed to have time in between finals to do a little food shopping. Then later on the week I played, plated and eaten most of these sweets. Boy, my dentist is going to love me now... Well, enjoy the show. Hopefully it looks good. Any critiques on these photos are welcome.Please note that you may click on the photo if you want to get more info. If you want to go directly to the photoset, click here.

Hey they might serve slightly different things but which did you find was better quality? Takashimaya or Minimoto Kitchoan?
hellokitty893112
2006-12-28 01:24:00
Well, it depends on what you're looking for. I think Takashimaya has more of a mainstream Japanese appeal, while Minimoto Kitchoan is a bit more exotic to the Western world. I find both are of great quality, since both are fairly expensive places to shop.

Well, it's official. I'm out of school for a month. I don't know if that's good thing for me but heck, I don't want to deal (or have to) with papers and exams until after New Year's. After that I need to bury myself in study books for the LSATs.I planned to hang out with my two friends who attends from my former school, St. John's University about a few days ago. They agreed and luckily for them, finals were over for almost a week. Anyways, we met at one of my friends' house, Helen. She's not usually a morning person and somehow she managed to surprise me (or should I say, myself and my best friend since high school, Seungmi?) that she's up at 8:30 AM. Trust me, this is a record for her since she told me that she tends to wake up in the afternoon.Anyways, we took the subway to Bryant Park for some ice skating. This is the second time in my entire life that I've ever skated. (The first was a Christmas present of sorts from Helen last year at Rockefeller Center.) I still have the painful memories of actually wiping out pretty bad on the ice last year. Not once. Twice, and then a few little slips. Thankfully this year, I managed not to fall but I have a few trips but I've managed to save myself from falling; or my friends held on to my hand guiding me the way. The funniest quote that's written on the boards of the rink was from Citibank that says, \"People are like snowflakes. No two are alike but they are always fun to watch.\" The skaters on the rink might be fun to watch because they can actually fall pretty darn hard. The people watching just outside the rink are having a kick out of the poor souls falling unlike graceful snowflakes, even taking videos of us...eek!My rants about this rink is that they don't let you take pictures. They also, charge you almost $10 for renting some really ugly and uncomfortable skates that really strangle your feet after wearing it for 40 minutes to have pain kicking in. But I guess they have to make some money somehow by having free admission to the rink. That's how grotesque and crappy these skates were: After our skating session, we walked around Bryant Park's Holiday Market since it's just a few feet away from the rink. Heck, we're fascinated with the merchandise they sell. I'm mesmerized with the glass objects, while Helen and Seungmi are digging the hats (seen below):Glass butterflies (after I took this pic, the vendor told me \"No photos.\")This is Helen, modeling the \"Kitty Hat.\"This is my best friend since high school, Seungmi. Doesn't she look adorable in this photo?!After we walked our way through the entire market, browsing through the really cool objects, we're craving for some hot chocolate. When it comes to hot chocolate there's only one who's really the best so far, in my opinion, and that's Jacques Torres' Chocolate Haven in SoHo. We took a subway to Jacques' and it's really bustling with the last days shoppers (as I would call them, since it's 4 days before Christmas) and patrons getting their fill of hot chocolate. I managed to get the Wicked Hot Chocolate with peppermint crunch and a Mudslide Cookie. While, Helen got herself a Classic Hot Chocolate with whipped cream and Seungmi got the mocha with whipped cream.My Wicked Hot Chocolate with Peppermint Crunch (settled on the bottom of the cup)The Mudslide CookieSeungmi's Mocha with Whipped Cream...seems like extra, since it's overflowingI've split my cookie with them. I must admit this cookie is divine. It's very, very chocolatey and sweet (but not tooth-achingly sweet) with chunks of walnuts. I should have asked them to warm it up a bit so the cookie would be a bit softer and gooier. But anyways, I just can't seem to replicate this recipe at home. I mean, if I'm in serious need of a chocolate kick, this cookie would be an awesome way to satiate my craving. I need to get Jacques Torres' book and search for this evasive recipe.We've enjoyed our beverages. My Wicked hot chocolate is slightly spicy with a tiny bit of tingle in the back of my throat that indicates the spiciness. The chocolate itself is great and the mint factor from the crushed candy canes (which they call it \"peppermint crunch\") has a nice cooling effect. Honestly, when I requested the peppermint crunch the person who made it for me had that look saying I'm weird but really, who cares? It's my hot chocolate. To those of you who never seen my face before...here it is.Yep, that's me. A shocker isn't it? I've looked worse than this in other photos (I'm not photogenic) but this came out pretty good. Thanks to Helen for this candid shot of me, using my camera.Speaking of Helen, she particularly loves the whipped cream from her hot chocolate that she even licked it from the bottom of her lid! It must've been really good. Or she's really hungry. Then there's Seungmi savoring her mocha. Except Helen's interrupting her moment of contentment with my camera flashing before her very eyes.Well, after our noshing of chocolate and getting a really good sugar/caffeine rush out of this, we walked it off to getting a burger from Stand. I remembered reading from NY Magazine about a week ago that it's opened. However when we got there, the first thing I've noticed that it's empty and it's almost 2 PM. But then as I looked at the door, there's a sign that said that they're opened for dinner. They will be opening for lunch after January 2. Arrgh! No! I craved for a really good, greasy, juicy burger.After the wash of disappointment, we thought of going to Momofuku Ssam Bar and headed out east toward 2nd Avenue. But then Helen wanted some sushi instead. So, we ended up in Japonica.Helen and I ordered the nigiri-sushi set, while Seungmi got herself a bento box lunch, as you'll see below.This is my nigiri plate; Helen's pretty much the same but no tuna in her's.Seungmi's Bento BoxSushi's fish portions are actually quite generous. It's more of a two-biter than the traditional one bite sushi. The fish is fresh and tasty but it's not the most exquisite sushi I've ever eaten in my entire life, mind you. Somehow, Helen managed to get that whole piece to fit in her mouth and masticate it for a good minute. It was quite entertaining to watch her eat it.Then Seungmi's bento box is quite substantial as well. The main dish of sorts was the fried chicken nuggets that is on the lower right on the photo. She let me taste one and it's actually pretty good. It's not too greasy and it was quite hot. I think her food is the better bargain, if you seek for a substantial meal. It cost under $14, while my sushi plate was $20. Japonica is a good neighborhood establishment for decent sushi and Japanese fare that doesn't cost you a ton of money.That's basically our day out together and it was a lot of fun and food.Addresses: Jacques Torres' Chocolate Haven 350 Hudson Street (at King Street) New York, NYStand 24 E. 12th Street (between 5th Avenue & University Pl.)

The Chocolate Bar cookbook has the recipe for Jacque's mudslide cookies in it. I made them over the summer and they were really good! (although not quiteee as good as from the store)

They don't let you take photos at Wollman Rink in Central Park, either. I'd imagine it's less to do with actual photo-taking than with liability issues -- maybe they don't want you falling on your camera and getting hurt and suing. Who knows. I've never really followed the rules. When it's busy enough, you can suppress the flash and hide among the crowd to get your photos. Or you can always take pictures from the edge of the rink.I'd imagine they let you take photos at Rockefeller, no? Seems too touristy to restrict them there.

hatchback - My friend who hung out with me that day, Helen, brought her camera out to Rockefeller Center (last year) with no issues whatsoever. They let her carry her small bag out and take pictures. It was never an issue with them but what can I do really? It doesn't matter that much to me anymore.

To reiterate what I said, it's finals week for me and it was a killer for me. My brain feels a bit fried from all the stress for packing in 6 finals within 3 days. It's ridiculous what colleges do to students. I'm assuming law school would be 5 - 10 times more intense than what I'd faced. Oh well...Sorry about that sidetrack; going on with food now... On Tuesday, my literature final was during the late afternoon. So, I took advantage of the ample time of sorts to go to Payard Patissere & Bistro in the Upper East Side at 12 PM for desesrt. If you're wondering if I eaten anything savory, yes I have but it's not worth talking/writing about. It's just a salad. Ok? When I entered this restaurant/patisserie, it was bustling with lots of activity. I even saw the pastry chef himself, Mr. Francois Payard, helping out the staff in the front placing orders in boxes. Most of the patrons are basically local women who lunch, tourists, and people who want to take a break from power shopping around the area. So, after browsing through the gorgeous cakes, tarts and pastries. I was faced with the problem of what the heck do I want to eat? I mean, look at them! I can't decide between two different chocolate cakes or two bright colored cakes. Eventually, I went against chocolate (very unusual of me) and went for the Chinon.Chinon - uncut with different perspectivesLooks good, doesn't it? Well, it looks delicious but in my opinion, it's good but not the \"greatest dessert I've ever eaten in my entire life\" good. It had a subtle pistachio flavor from the bavarios (the bright green, mousse-like stuff on the top), not much flavor from the cake itself. The real flavor that sparked my tongue was the cherry jam. The jam was sour cherry had some almond praline bits that gave it some crunch and sweetness to contrast that sourness from the cherries. I don't really think it was worth my $6, but I would have never known until I try it.Today, it was my last day of finals (yay!). When I finished around 1 PM, I was starving. I didn't want to eat anymore Whole Foods or Bouchon Bakery that I practically have ate during the entire semester, so I chose to go downtown, to Chelsea that is. I recalled reading from various websites that there's a new sandwich place called Swich and generally have gotten good feedback. This place is really green. I mean the walls, trays, the employees' uniforms are green with accents of white. It's a very lively color but wow, they've taken it to the umpeenth level.It's green everywhere!The staff are very friendly and sociable. It is also packed with people who are hungry like me; mostly locals who work around the area and shoppers having a break to get nourished. My real complaints from this restaurant is that the music is a bit too loud and the communal table is narrow (about 2 feet maximum). The latter is kind of bad because I like my own space, especially around total strangers who I've never met in my entire life. Also, I hate the occasional stare whenever I'm taking a photo. Anyways, I ordered the Positano sandwich and asked for my name so I could pick up my order in a couple of minutes. When they called my name, I assumed it wouldn't be basically this: A tray lined with a bright green & white paper with this aluminum wrapped sandwich on top. I was expecting at least a paper plate. Is that too much to ask for from an eating establishment? But getting over my initial shock, I took my seat and unwrapped this sandwich, which looks like this (arranged in a more appealing way): At least I'm satisfied with the fact that my sandwich isn't sorry looking as I would expect. The bread is perfectly toasted and charred. The creamy mozzarella was a nice contrast to the salty prosciutto, bitter arugula and zesty basil. The tomato was fresh and exude a good bit of its juice as I ate along. It was a really delicious sandwich.After eating that sandwich, I craved for dessert. Something chocolatey. I know, it's bad. So, I wanted to go to Michel Cluziel for a while and I decided to go there. I just walked over to Union Square, where the ABC Carpet & Home store is. I have to admit, that store is basically a dream that I would shop in; everything's beautiful or whimsical that I would like to own. Almost like Anthropologie.Back to Michel...so, here what their boutique of sorts within ABC.I took a seat and looked over the menu... I decided on a single hot chocolate and the coeur de creme. When one of the staff members came to my table, I ordered the aforementioned items. While I was waiting, I took a few photos, seen below. It's just a few I posted. There's much more chocolate eye candy to look at my Flickr site. Eventually, after waiting about 5 minutes. I've gotten my order.The single hot chocolate (size of a demitasse cup)The Coeur de Creme with Dark Chocolate Drizzle & Orange XOThe couer de creme is cute. I don't particularly love liquor (but I do occasionally bake and cook with them) but everything else that's listed on the menu (that was pictured) that isn't liquor or alcohol based, wasn't amusing to me and it's something that I can make at home. Yes, I do admit that I can make coeur de creme at home, but I don't want to buy a mold that I won't be using frequently. Anyways, this creme was sinfully creamy, as expected. The bittersweet chocolate drizzle was a nice touch to the subtly sweet, soft cheese; the orange XO was an obvious boozy touch. The metallic chocolate pearls on top was a nice garnish. Overall, this is not a bad dessert.The odd thing is that when I started to take photos of this couer, the woman who took my order, thought and asked me if I was writing for a magazine. Hahaha! Me? Writing a for magazine. I'm a bit flattered but obviously, I'm not. I just told her that I like to take photos of food. I'm not even going to bother mentioning a food blog. It would bring another level of weirdness that is already amounted on me.The hot chocolate is almost perfect to my taste. It's not too sweet; it has enough chocolate flavor and it's just scalded to the correct temperature. But I would like it to be a bit more creamier. It's actually more milky in texture than creamy. This was a splurge dessert and I can't help myself not to leave this place without getting a couple of chocolates. I haven't eaten them yet but it'll be gone very soon.A lot more desserts/snacks has been consumed that I should write but I just don't have time. But it'll be up soon. I'm just tired from all the finals and I have to start baking soon, since the holidays are less than 5 days away.If you want to view more photos of Michel Cluizel, please click here. A little side note of sorts, if you happened to take your camera there and be tempted to take photos. Make sure to ask to almost everyone who works there because I have the mixed messages from three employees; two out of three said it's fine, as long it's for personal use and the last one told me that I'm not supposed to. *sighs* It seems they need to get their photo policy straightened out or how they communicate because it's getting to be a pain.Addresses: Payard Patisserie & Bistro 1032 Lexington Avenue (between 73rd & 74th Streets) New York, NYSwich 104 8th Avenue (between 15th & 16th Streets) New York, NYChocolat Michel Cluziel (it's inside ABC Carpet & Home) 888 Broadway (between 18th & 19th Streets) New York, NY

Yesterday I had the intention of going to eat lunch at Cafe Sabarsky. However, the wait was killing me - almost 40 minutes and I was starving! So, I just gave up my spot on line and just took a bus down 5th Avenue. I ended up going to Takashimaya's Tea Box Cafe. I wanted to eat here for a while and since I this is my chance now, I went in. Those of you who have never went in here before, it's basically an upscale Japanese department store that tastefully blend Japanese and French style. (I must say that their first floor floral boutique arrangements are gorgeous.) Anyways, the Tea Box Cafe is in the basement of the store. Once you get there, you're greeted with all things tea; may it be teapots, tea leaves, as well as some Japanese confections and cookies.Since it's lunch hour (1 PM), there's a wait list of people but fortunately I could kill my time a bit just browsing their wares for 10 minutes. When the hostess called me in, I was seated on the corner that borders the outside main room and the interior room. Hence the photo you see below.Main roomInterior room; toward the backThe decor looks serene and the colors are very neutral: shades of tan and light brown. The back room is very dim lit. The demographic of the diners here are basically tourists, women who lunch, and a few for business lunch. I ordered the Bento Box Lunch ($19) and a pot of oolong tea ($5).Bento Box My pot o' teaThe oolong tea is wonderful. The tea leaves they used are of one of the finest quality as I have tasted.The bento box looks great and nicely presented. The rice section of the bento: It's a medium grain rice, it had a more stickier texture than a long grain rice (obviously, because the starch content is slightly greater). It was really nutty in flavor because of the toasted sesame seeds and also there were chopped chestnuts. It's different for me but it tastes good. It had flavors of soy and nuances of shrimp.Next was the duck salad. I didn't realize there was duck until I moved all of those microgreens to the side. The duck was perfectly cooked and well, delicious. I just wished it had more than two slices of duck. The vinaigrette tasted fine; a nice balance of sweet and tang but was a bit too oily for me, when I saw a pool of oil at the bottom of my bowl.Then I went onto the miscellaneous dish. It's filled with a slice of fried, dried tofu (the square on the right). It was glazed with a sweet sauce, which I don't know the name. My complaint is that it's cold. I'm more accustomed with having tofu served warm. The squash, on the left of the tofu, tasted different. I can't explain it exactly but it had the texture of a cooked wax potato - mealy, and not much flavor in it either. The shrimp shumai, in the back of the tofu, is actually one of the best shumai I've tasted in a long time. The shrimp is not overcooked and the wrapping is at the perfect thickness. Finally, the yellow slice that you see in the back, it's a wedge of egg with chestnuts. I would describe it as a wedge of dense frittata with chunks of chestnuts. The chestnut gave an interesting texture to the egg but not much for flavor.And last but not least, the salmon. It's a bit overdone to my preference - medium well. I prefer, medium rare because it's a bit too dry for my taste but at least it's not the texture of canned tuna. It tasted fine - it had a sweet glaze of sorts, possibly teriyaki. I did not eat that green chile pepper because I don't want to know I'll have my throat blown out. I like spicy food but I have limits.Once I was finished eating the bento box, my waitress presented me the coconut jelly with mango sauce. She told me it came with the bento box meal. So here it is. It's very good. The jelly is very silky and creamy with great coconut flavor and encountered tiny bits of coconut with every bite. The mango sauce is very flavorful and tasty but I think it's too overpowering for the jelly.Overall, it's not a bad meal. I just wished that it wasn't so crowded with people. I just want to have a quiet lunch but I know it's almost impossible to have that in the middle of Manhattan.Later on, I went to Minamoto Kitchoan for dessert. I might as well stick with the Japanese theme since I'm on a roll. Anyways, I just bought whatever is seasonal. Unfortunately, they ran out of that pumpkin shaped wagashi that I wanted to buy but I could live with the others that I've gotten:SuikanshukuLeft to Right: Hanatsubomi, Ayaichigo Jelly, and KurihorakuThis is my own dessert flight. Anyways, this is how it looked unwrapped:Left to Right: Hanatsubomi, Ayaichigo Jelly, and KurihorakuSuikanshukuProbably you might think ayichigo jelly or the suikanshuku looks weird but they all taste divine.The suikanshuku is the most interesting out of the whole group. It's dried persimmon fruit filled with white bean paste and rolled in pearl sugar. It's chewy, subtly sweet and the persimmon flavor is very subtle. Normally I don't like the fresh persimmons my mom usually gets in Flushing, but this is an exception.The hanatsubomi: It's entirely edible, believe it or not. The yuzu is candied or what their description says, steamed, enough that the yuzu is not overwhelmingly tart. It's just sour or citrusy enough that you taste the orange-lemon flavors radiating out from the peel. The white bean paste is very smooth; it's a nice contrast to the slightly fibrous yuzu peel.The ayaichigo jelly might look creepy to some on this plate. But this is a wonderful jelly. It's arguably the sweetest out of the four confections that I have, possibly because of the strawberry purée that they have incorporated into the red bean paste. This would be a spring dessert to me, since the delicate, floral strawberry flavors reminds me of spring. It's a nice change to the chestnuts and heartier flavors that would be associated with fall or winter.The last one is the kurihoraku: This is the closest to winter, if you want to associate flavors besides the persimmon. It's a purée of red bean paste with sweet potato paste. It's silky smooth throughout the confection, but not it's not the most dazzling to my palate.If you have to ask me which ones did I like the most, I would say either the dried persimmon or the ayaichigo jelly.Addresses: Takashimaya's Tea Box Cafe 693 5th Avenue (located in the basement of the store) New York, NYMinamoto Kitchoan 608 Fifth Avenue (off 49th Street) New York, NYThank you for reading and have a great weekend.

Hey Tina!I love your picture of the Hanatsubomi - I've never seen such a perfect looking dessert that was entirely edible! We have a shop here in Hawaii called Shirokiya that specializes in Japanese dessert...might have to venture there now :)

ahhhh I love Minamoto Kitchoan, I have been thinking about going down there before the end of the session, since right now I think they have the chocolate difuku still.But The ayaichigo jelly and Hanatsubomi look great. I love the way they tast, I happen to quite like the Hanatsubomi a bit more.

ooh yes.. i bought quite a lot from Takashimaya, Singapore... but the counter ran out of Hanatsubomi. So, i got candied yuzu peels instead :-(  Then I got another batch from my Japanese neighbour which made me very happy indeed!

I made these a few days ago, if some of you have seen it on my Flickr page. The main reason why I've made them because: (1) My parents purchased a lot of whole chickens over the weekend and (2) My mom's having a craving for a savory version of the mantou; in other words, a stuffed steam bun.As you can see it went pretty well. Thankfully, my dad's a little more of the expert on making the ground chicken filling. Yes, he boned and skinned the chicken and used a meat grinder to make this filling. My mom chopped the Chinese chives and the reconstituted shitake mushrooms to add more depth of texture and flavor to the meat filling. I just made the bread dough from the leftover starter that I have in my refrigerator from my sourdough venture from Thanksgiving.Unfortunately, I was not too sure what is in the meat filling, as in the measurements or proportions of the ingredients in there. To tell you vaguely, it's about half a pound of ground chicken, chopped Chinese chives, chopped reconstituted shitake mushrooms, salt, pepper, sesame seed oil, a tiny bit of water, and oyster sauce. I forgot to ask my parents since they're making the filling at an earlier time when I was studying...sorry.The bread dough's recipe1 cup of my leftover starter3 cups of unbleached all purpose flour1 cup of room temperature water1/2 teaspoon of salt(Please note that these measurements are approximate.)Mix all the ingredients above and let it proof (rise) overnight in a lightly greased bowl. Once it's proofed, dump it out on a floured counter and knead the dough. Let it rest for 10 minutes and then cut the dough into three wedges. Take one wedge, cover the remaining two in plastic wrap or invert the bowl that the dough has been risen, and roll it out into a long log, until it is about 1 1/2 inches in diameter. Repeat this to the remaining wedges. Once that's done, line up all three logs of dough and cut it into 1 1/2 inches in length. Cover all but one piece. Dust the counter with flour again. Flatten the one piece of dough into a flat circle and roll it with a rolling pin until it's about a 1/8 inch thickness. Repeat to the remaining dough pieces.

My New Favorite Cupcake & Espresso in the Upper East Side...

Today, I went to the Upper East Side, as I've promised from the last post that I'm going to Two Little Red Hens. I have two reasons in mind for this visit: (1) it's been 2 years since I've been here (2) I want to try their Brooklyn Blackout Chocolate Cupcake and a muffin since I'm doing \"research\" for a future posting. The bakery has a very charming and homey atmosphere. The window's decorated for Christmas and their bakery was a little behind on the morning's muffin rush because as one of the staff members told me that the bakers were rushing in the cake orders from the night before. I don't have a grudge against that. Totally understandable since the holidays are coming. So all I did was order their highly acclaimed Brooklyn Blackout Chocolate Cupcake, which cost me $4.Cupcake nestled in a box of waxed paper.I just sat down and lingered there for a while, taking photos of the place, watching people watching, and listening to tunes of Simon & Garfunkel playing from the bakery's speakers. Eventually, when another person asks for a muffin, they finally checked in the back for the coveted muffins. Voilà, a basket full of freshly baked muffins. The flavors available for today was blueberry lemon, cranberry, pumpkin, and something else. The only thing that attracted me was the pumpkin. The muffins cost $2, by the way, and I ate it. I'm not going to talk about much on this muffin because I'm going to write about it in detail in a week or two; so stay tuned if you want to know.The cupcake...what a cupcake! This is a chocoholic's dream cupcake! It's moist, flavorful...and chocolatey. Actually, this cupcake hits you with chocolate in 3 ways: the chocolate cupcake, the chocolate buttercream frosting with crushed chocolate cookie bits on top, and the chocolate cream center. So, it's a combination of a sugar and chocolate high. Look below:Cupcake: unwrapped It's bustin' out with tons of chocolate!This cupcake is large enough to share between two people. I am just the greedy chocoholic, so I finished the whole thing.After I finished this fabulously delicious cupcake, I walked it off a bit to Lexington Avenue for some espresso. I need caffeine and something bitter to counteract all the sweets I've just consumed. I remembered a good place for espresso drinks within a twenty so block distance, called Sicaffe.Sicaffe opened a few years ago, when I remembered reading about it in NY Magazine and I paid a visit there. Basically, today seems like a day of revisits to places I haven't been in a while. So, when I arrived there, I ordered their signature espresso drink, Triestino Dopio for $3.64 with tax. It's the closest thing to a real Italian espresso. It's smooth, dark, robust and syrupy espresso with a thick, creamy, foamy top (note that it's whole milk I've ordered). It's been a good morning, as a breakfast of sorts. Not healthy but the food and drink was spot on.Addresses: Two Little Red Hens 1652 2nd Ave (near 86th Street) New York, NYSicaffe 964 Lexington Avenue (between 70 & 71st Streets) New York, NYTo see more photos, just go to my Flickr gallery.

Restaurant Week: Eleven Madison Park

***CONTENT
This is my final Restaurant Week review. I've changed my mind into going to another restaurant for RW. I don't think I can handle it anymore. So, let me talk about Eleven Madison Park, shall I?I went to Eleven Madison Park before. As in my pre-blogging days and it was two years ago before the current chef, Daniel Humm, took charge of the kitchen. The restaurant has made a few changes, physically, in comparison to my last visit: they got rid of the large chandeliers and the black leather banquettes with a warm colored wood are the seating now. In all, the formality is gone but it's still the most formal restaurant out of all of Danny Meyer's (the restaurateur) restaurants. It's just a bit more welcoming and warm due to the colors and the elimination of the chandeliers. You'll see below. Also you might want to see the Amateur Gourmet's review/photos of the place when it was the pre-Humm days.The Restaurant Week menu (to see a larger version, just click on the photo):I should mention that they didn't seat me all the way to Siberia unlike at Telepan. I'm actually seated where most of the activity is buzzing around.Other things they've changed is that the use of the maple leaf marketing: they only emblazoned the leaf only along the side of the banquettes; no longer on the butter (seen below) neither on the menu.The bread served there was a choice of: a mini French baguette, a slice of multi-grain bread and a mini olive batard. I opted for the olive bread just because I like olives.The bread was superb: crusty and crisp on the outside, chewy on the inside, slightly salty and briny from the olives. Delicious. The butter was good, too. I think it tasted better than Telepan's.For some reason when I looked on the beverages available, I wanted to have a glass of non-alcoholic wine. Yes, I ordered grape juice but not any juice, it's a Pinot Noir grape juice. It was a pretty darn expensive glass too; it cost me $7. Well, it tasted like grape juice but not like the stuff you drink when you were a child. It's sweet but not cloyingly. I regret ordering that but I said it and it's done. I might as well order a bottle of wine (pretty good choices) that I remember seeing that cost $24.07 instead of this grape juice. [bangs head on table for stupidity.]As for the actual food, my appetizer was the \"Big Eye Tuna with Satsuma Tangerine and Pickled Radishes.\"When my server came, I was slightly astonished to see this long, narrow plate. It's beautifully presented and arranged. It also tasted as good as it looks. The tuna was almost melt-in-your-mouth. I said \"almost\" just because it was cut into 1/2 inch cubes so I have to chew it. The vinaigrette, radishes and tangerine were nice, sweet-sour accompaniments to the tuna. I liked this appetizer.Next up was the \"Navarin of Colorado Lamb with Taggiassa Olives and Tomato Confit.\" It also came with a small bowl of mashed potatoes.The mashed potatoes was unexpected, since I didn't remember seeing it on the menu but it was a nice thought. The lamb tasted wonderful and hearty. The vegetables highlighted some sweetness of the lamb and everything tasted fresh and the olives gave it some briny salinity that was a good contrast to the heartiness of the lamb. The mashed potatoes tasted fine, nothing spectacular to note about. It was creamy (both flavor and texture) and a hint of butter. If you're a meat and potato person, this is your dish.Last but not least, dessert; which was the \"Espresso Frozen Parfait with Banana Macadamia Nut Crisp & Chocolate Soup.\"First of all, the chocolate soup was poured from a silver sauce boat at the table. When the server poured it, the chocolate soup flowed down like a much thicker, milk chocolate version of City Bakery's hot chocolate. The crisp that you see, is salty and sweet, underneath that crisp are two large dots of bittersweet (tasted like 62% cocoa) ganache with sweet, softe ned banana slices. I liked this combination together. It worked well. As for the frozen dome of the espresso parfait, it was quite hard that I have to use some force to get a piece off of it. It's quite potent in the espresso flavor, also the use of ground espresso beans (under the dome) amplified the espresso flavor. The chocolate soup had small, ground up bits of macadamia nuts. When I ate each component in a bite, it didn't work out too well. I honestly enjoyed my dessert from Telepan more than here. So, two out of three courses that I like a lot, isn't bad at all.When I paid my check, my waiter gave me a gift certificate that is worth $24.07 just because I ate here during Restaurant Week. I must admit, Danny Meyer is one smart businessman. This is tempting me to go back here for lunch again.

Brunch & Gelato with Robyn! And a Small Dessert at Cafe Zaiya

***CONTENT
I finally gotten the opportunity to eat with another (and more popular) food blogger, Robyn. You know? The \"Girl Who Ate Everything.\"I actually e-mailed her about having breakfast or lunch with her a few weeks ago just before the week I start classes. Since she wasn't a morning person like I am, we met at 11 AM. In my time, it's the afternoon. Her time, she told me that this is earlier than what she would normally wake up. Oy. She reminds me of my friend, Seungmi: they're both adorable, they like sleeping or napping, and they like to eat. I'm content. ^^Anyways, the meeting place was at Florent. I always wanted to go here for a while and I haven't gotten the chance, so I might as well eat here with Robyn.When we went inside this restaurant, the decor reminds me of a diner with really dim lights (and the lights gave an orange glow to the place). The stainless steel counter where patrons can sit on stools, the friendly waiters and waitresses, and lots of locals eat here. It's not scene-y as the nearby Pastis.The menu has simple and familiar French bistro fare; they also have daily specials. Robyn ordered the \"Special Sandwich\" ($12.50; which is today's special) which is basically a grilled Cajun spiced ahi tuna burger on a toasted English muffin with a side of fries. I ordered the standard fare of brunch: the Eggs Benedict with fries ($10). Here's what our order looks like:My eggs benedict was cooked to perfection: the tell-tale signs of the runny egg yolk (as you'll see below). It tasted fine but I didn't love it. I think it needed more salt but since my fries had salt, it balances out. I think I like Robyn's burger more than my benedict. Hmmm... I almost forgot to mention, the fries were pretty good too: Hot, slightly crisp and salty.At the end of our meal, Robyn inquired the idea of dessert. Eating dessert in Florent is not what I had in mind, so we paid our check and walked around the area. Originally, I thought of going to Tea & Sympathy but we just wandered in to Chelsea Market. Robyn asked what I like to eat in here, so I pointed out a few things and places but when we passed by Buon Italia, she wanted gelato! Argh. I normally would've have thunk of eating ice cream or gelato in the dead of winter and it's actually cold today but when we kept on walking down the Market, and L'Arte Del Gelato had someone giving out small samples of their cherry vanilla. When we tried it, it was agreed that it tasted really good.We walked into their small stand of sorts, and actually sampled a couple of flavors before we bought a small cup of our own gelato. After pigging out on samples and being our indecisive selves, we finally made a decision after 5 minutes probably. Robyn ordered pistachio and strawberry. Oddly, she was feeling \"fruity\" instead of chocolate-y and she loves pistachio gelato. I ordered gianduja and marscapone. I must have my filling of chocolate. It's a daily requirement.Here's the photo of our goods, when we found seating a couple of yards away:All of the gelato flavors were intense, fresh, delicious, and not cloyingly sweet. It's creamy, dreamy and it cost us $3.75 each. It's not bad. Robyn's strawberry tasted like fresh strawberries and her pistachio gelato well, tasted like roasted pistachio. I was a bit apprehensive from trying pistachio gelato because of a really awful childhood experience with pistachio ice cream. My mom bought a half gallon of Friendly's ice cream from my local supermarket when I was young and she bought pistachio. When I ate a few spoons of the Friendly's pistachio ice cream, it tasted awful. It tasted medicinal, alcoholic; nothing tasted close or related to pistachio. Whenever there was a pistachio ice cream or gelato flavor, I avoid it like the plague ever since. But when I sampled Robyn's pistachio gelato, it redeemed my faith in the pistachio gelato. Not all pistachio flavored ice cream or gelato are created like Friendly's. Thank goodness! Thank you Robyn for now getting me hooked on pistachio gelato. Now I have an another food obsession. Like I need more?I love my gelato flavors. The mascarpone was delicately flavored with mascarpone cheese and a slight hints of vanilla. It was a good contrast to the gianduja, which is intensely chocolate-y and a background flavor of hazelnut. *sighs* I'm in gelato heaven. I haven't eaten good gelato like that since Il Laboratori del Gelato. I had a daring thought that in one hot, sweltering summer day I'll go to this gelato shop and actually ask for a large cup or container and ask for a scoop of every flavor they've got and I'll live off of it for the day. I'll be satisfied and feel cooler by then.Once we finished our dessert, we waddled our way around the Chelsea and Union Square, perusing various stores and I walked with Robyn to her apartment, just for the sake of burning a few calories. When I left Robyn at her place, I roamed around Curry Hill and eventually I had a strange craving for more sweets. I have a very strange stomach. I ended up walking to Cafe Zaiya and I bought the Sweet Potato Pie or is it puff? It cost me $1.95.This somehow appealed to me compared to the other pastries and buns that were available. In terms of taste, this does taste like a sweet potato pie but much sweeter due to the sugar glaze and the puff pastry that enveloped the sweet potato filling was quite flaky. It was good but a bit too sweet for my taste.In all, it's been a good day: I ate out with another food blogger who got me hooked on pistachio gelato and it actually feels like a real January day in New York, unlike what happened a couple of weeks ago. I like the prior more than the latter.

This is a slideshow just for the sake of posting photos of stuff I bought in the city and a homemade cappuccino.I'm kind of proud of my own cappuccino just because of the fact I can make a decent cup of my own without spending $4. No, I don't own an espresso machine. I have those stovetop espresso makers and I foamed my milk with Bodum's Schiuma set.The chocolates are from Moonstruck Chocolate. Cute little critters. Really. The Japanese desserts or snacks are just...well, my obsession for Minamoto Kitchoan's stuff. I'm really a sucker for their packaging.I almost forgot. If you want to know the flavors of the chocolates and the five wagashis, in respective order. Click here and/or here.Enjoy the show!

Hankerin' for some Gorg and Figs

***CONTENT
I've been having a huge craving for blue cheese and figs for the past week that it's been driving me crazy!Well, since my mom wanted me to cook dinner for her, I thought of going for a two or three course menu and it one has to be involved with the fig and blue cheese (since I want to eat them). I remember skimming through one of Mario Batali's books, Molto Italiano, in Barnes & Nobles a couple of months ago in the city about a simple appetizer that involves with fresh figs that is stuffed with gorgonzola cheese and wrapped in prosciutto.Since fresh figs are out of season, I thought of using dried figs and reconstitute it in balsamic vinegar for 5-7 minutes. This reduces the balsamic to a certain level of sweetness from the reduction process and the dried figs' sugar.I then took out the figs, cut the tops off and stuff it with gorgonzola dolce cheese with a pastry bag. The reason I used gorgonzola dolce is the fact that my mom's not enamored with blue cheese, generally. So this is a ploy of sorts to get to her to like blue cheese. Then I wrap it in some prosciutto di parma and torch it briefly with my hand held blowtorch.As for plating, I used the center for the toasted rosemary bread with a thin slice of gorgonzola dolce, to reinforce what I used in this course. Then surround it with the prosciutto wrapped figs. The reduced balsamic vinegar is dotted in between the spaces of the figs and drizzled down the slice of gorgonzola dolce.The wine of choice to pair this course was a 2005 Côtes du Rhône from Château du Trignon that I bought from Chelsea Vault Wines for about $12. It was recommended by a guy who works there. It's medium bodied, yet filling in the mouth, dry yet it was a nice lightness to contrast all the flavors that is going on in that plate. I like this wine and the price isn't so bad either.If you're wondering if I drank a lot. No, I just drank a glass that you see in that photo. I have a low tolerance for alcohol. Period.

Round 2 of Restaurant Week Lunch: Telepan

Oh vey. Another restaurant to eat in. Two more to go...(that's next week)Telepan in my perspective, a restaurant that caters to the neighborhood...well sort of. It's very basic food fare (nothing out of the ordinary) and the prices are moderate, considering the location. When I first entered the door of this restaurant, at the maître d's table I saw a small stack of Chef Bill Telepan's book! It just hit me of the NY Times article that Frank Bruni just written about. If you want to know what I'm talking about, click here. I felt a bit of vexation at that moment but it passed on.I was seated all the way in the back of the restaurant, in the corner. My first thought was \"Why?\" but a few moments passed on, I thought to myself, \"I don't mind some privacy.\" Should I mention that I was eating alone? And I lugged my Canon Rebel XT? So that's why I thought the latter. Also, I was seated a few tables away from two men trying to open a new restaurant of sorts and briefly met with Chef Telepan during the middle of my lunch.Anyways, back to the restaurant. The interior's very streamlined and it tries to be cheery or slightly energetic of sorts due to the lime green walls and the interesting lights that hang from the ceiling. The waiters and waitress (she served me initially but changed to a man later on) were courteous and presented my menu.Sorry it's a bit blurry. I didn't want to use any flash.I ordered an orange pekoe tea to begin with since I was freezing my butt off in 30 degrees weather (less with the wind chill factor). I know; it's an extra $5 that will be added to my check and I could live with it. I just want to drink something warm! The tea's pictured below. Somehow, it seems Bodum's teaware is eponymously used in all restaurants in Manhattan. Hmmm... Onto the food! I ordered: the House Smoked Brook Trout, the Duck Leg Confit, and the Crunchy Peanut Butter and Gianduja. Once I ordered, the bread came in: Honestly, I was anticipating a bread basket or tray but all I received was a warm, crusty, white roll. It was good but nothing sensational and the butter was fine.My appetizer, the House Smoked Brook Trout, looked really good and it tasted delicious. The trout is resting on top of a potato-buckwheat blini and a thin layer of radish sour cream. The trout was faintly smoked and it had a touch of bitterness from the shredded turnips. I just love that blini. It's very smooth and seductively creamy that I wished I have some more. The buckwheat flavor adds a nice nutty flavor to the soft, creamy potato.The entrée, Duck Leg Confit was honestly, my first duck confit. Even though I have read hundreds of times how to make duck leg confit, I have never attempted to make it myself. Anyways, my duck leg was succulent and delicious but it lacked that crispy skin that I hoped for. Nevertheless the duck meat and duck fat melts in my mouth that I can overlook that little flaw. The baby turnip greens, that is under the left half of the leg, was cooked perfectly and it imparted a nice sweet-bitter flavor to go along with the duck. The farro (seen on the photo below) was nutty and toothsome that gave it a good contrast to the soft, melt-in-your-mouth texture of the duck. The dried cherries was sweet and tart that went along with the nutty farro and the savory-sweet sauce.Now to the best part (at least for me, since I love desserts): the Crunch Peanut Butter and Gianduja.View of how it was presented Viewed at a different angleThis dessert is really trying to play on the American childhood nostalgia: peanut butter and jelly or the Kit-Kat bar and Reese's Peanut Butter Cup.The main portion of the dessert (the bar/cake in the center of the plate) reminds me of an upscale version of a Kit-Kat bar (texturally) with the flavor of a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup. It was really delicious. The gianduja somehow was really concentrated with the ground peanuts (hazelnuts were absent from this particular recipe, from what I tasted) that it was really nutty and crunchy with that biscuit that is on the bottom of this bar. The ice cream was intensely flavored with peanut butter and it was insanely creamy and rich. The small pool of dark, bittersweet chocolate (nearing or is at 80% cocoa) is a great addition to contrast the sweetness to the bar.The only thing that disappointed me was the huckleberry gelée because it insipid. I didn't really taste any huckleberry flavor (only a very faint hint of tartness) and it wasn't sweet or tart. All it really was a small pile of dark blue-black, slightly chewy jelly.In all, the food is very good but not very inventive fare. The ingredients are fresh and it's cooked almost spot-on. The staff is friendly and attentive; they didn't treat me like a weird person who likes to take photos of food and ate alone attitude. If I had the choice of coming back to eat here, I would.

The food looks great. The desserts looked like they took old classics and make them more sophisticated.- Giulia

Giulia - The food was delicious! I agree with you on the dessert: it's a modern reinterpretation.

I'm seriously eating too much food this week. I'm definitely taking it easy on the food after this Saturday. I'm still going to the remaining two restaurants next week but don't expect the daily write-ups I'm doing this week. It'll most likely be the once or twice a week posting from the next week on. Sorry, my body can handle so much food.Today I went to Chinatown since I'm eating all this fancy stuff the past two days (Cafe Sabarsky and A Voce), I just randomly go into different bakeries all over C-town and hope to find something that interests me at that moment. I feel a bit lethargic and lazy to write up every single detail of what I ate. So I just but up the slideshow of where and what I ate. Just hover over the thumbnail to read the caption. If you're wondering what I liked the most from what I ate was the egg custard tart for the mind blowing price of 50 cents! (While many bakeries charge on average of 60 - 70 cents a piece.)The other food I liked was the cha siu sou. Whenever my parents take out my family for dim sum, I always looked forward for that particular pastry. Something about that flaky, buttery (and possibly lard since my dad keeps emphasizing the use of pork fat when he used to work in restaurants back in his day), mixing with the soft, slightly salty, Chinese barbecue pork meat with the sauce is really tantalizingly good. *sighs* The one that I just ate today was actually not bad but it wasn't the same excellence that I had in a restaurant in Flushing, Queens. It was buttery and flaky, the filling was pretty generously meaty with some of the signature red sauce found in all the cha siu bao. Keep in mind that this pastry is supposed to be light and flaky but the meat filling is supposed to be dense. One should be enough, unless you either really love these things or you're really hungry. As in how you eat it (for those who don't know), if you're in a restaurant or at the table, it is suggested that you eat it with chopsticks and just take bites out of them, if you're on the go and they just give you the waxed paper bags, you may just eat them like they're buns. Just in case you are wondering, I bought these from Canal Seafood Restauarant on Canal Street; several doors away from Pearl Paint. It costs 60 cents a piece.

I hear ya about not posting too much because your body can't handle it.  I think my stomach got smaller...which is probably a good thing?  I don't know.  Eeuh.I used to go random bakery hunting too!  The uber cheap one you went to was the one on Mott Street?  I think I may have gone there a few times but had to stop because I would end up buying 2 or 3 things just cos it was so CHEAP and I figured \"Hey, why not?\"  It's like..how could you have a sale on Chinese baked goods?  They're already cheaper than most things.  Egaaad.

Honestly, I think ever since the holidays I had that weird feeling of not being hungry. Except that fact that I had cravings of a certain type of food. Odd.Ah, I had that logic going through my mind about buying multiple things in a really cheap bakery. I just wish I have a larger stomach and a really fast metabolism.

Ah. Thanks for the link to this and the info. Glad to have gotten the primer on eating them with chopsticks. Otherwise I would have just picked it up with my hands :(

Hatchback: You're welcome. It's somewhat common to the unaware to pick them up with their hands; it's not a huge taboo.

Double Dose of Espresso and Lunch at A Voce!

For those of you who have been loyal readers (and I thank you for that), I told you that I'm eating out in four different restaurants on the Winter Restaurant Week. Today's reservation is at A Voce. More on that later.I started the morning with a latte at Café Grumpy. Those of you who are familiar with this place, it's actually from Greenpoint, Brooklyn. However, recently I read from New York Magazine the past week that it just opened in Chelsea. Since I love espresso and coffee, I have to try it.The odd thing about this place is the block that it's located. I mean, the entire street is parked with the local residents' cars and police vehicles (the precinct is a few doors down). The photo below will explain what I mean. The interior is nice. One side of the café has the exposed brick wall, while the opposite has photos and artwork that is pleasing and it's dimly lit. One half of the café is the coffee/espresso bar and the other half is seating (about 6 tables). It's really a casual, relaxed vibe you feel once you enter here. I ordered a latte ($3.25 as listed on their menu). It's actually pretty good...but I had better. In my opinion, I like Joe's latte more but for the real espresso, I love Sicaffe. The problem with Sicaffe is that it's in the Upper East Side of Manhattan and I don't go there often. Somehow with Grumpy's latte, it's a little bit too milky.After my latte break, I went up to Madison Avenue to meet with my friend, Giulia for lunch at A Voce. We were actually half an hour earlier than my 11:45 reservation, so we killed some time wandering around the neighborhood, browsing at some stores or just walk around to keep ourselves warm (since it's technically 34 degrees Fahrenheit outside; not including wind chill).We came back to the restaurant about three minutes before they technically open and I stated my name for the reservation. We were seated and were given the menu.The place actually feels casual yet upscale. The seating is interesting. The seats along the walls are plush benches and the seats opposite it are cushioned swivel chairs (but in a good, comfortable way). The host and hostess were friendly; our waiter and servers were amicable and attentive. I like it here even before the ordering the food!I know it was a far stretch that the renowned duck meatballs would be on the Restaurant Week (I'll refer to it as RW, from now on) prix fixe menu (it's actually on the a la carte menu. Drats!). To tell you honestly, their RW menu isn't so bad: four choices for appetizers, four main courses, and three desserts. I've seen far more fewer (and worse) choices per course in my past years dining during RW.After a few minutes, our waiter came back to take our orders. So, I had the Ravioli Fagiole, \"My Grandmother's Meat Ravioli\" (That's the name; I'm not making it up. I don't even have an Italian grandmother. It's actually referring to Chef Andrew Carmellini's grandma), and for dessert Chocolate something. As for the chocolate dessert, I forgot to write down the name so um, to save myself from a misnomer (and use the general term \"something\") I'll just describe it to you later on. Giulia ordered the Crispy Calamari Salad, Marinated Chicken Alla Griglia, and a Citrus Tiramisu. She wanted a chocolate dessert (she's a chocoholic like I am) but since I ordered it, she intentionally ordered a different dessert for variety.After our orders were taken, the bread tray was brought to our table.It's slices of really good cibatta bread with a dipping bowl of olive oil with drops of balsamic vinegar and flecks of chili flakes. The bread reminds me of Sullivan Street Bakery's cibatta: a perfectly thin, crisp crust with a spongy, chewy crumb. It's wonderful with the olive oil dip: rich, fruity olive oil mixed with the sweet, slightly acidic vinegar; it's hard to stop eating the darn bread! We had to control ourselves before we just ruin our appetite.Then came our appetizers: my ravioli fagiole and Giulia's crispy calamari salad. I totally have forgotten that fagiole is a bean soup. Being a foodie of sorts, it's a shame to my knowledge or just overlooking that fact. Generally I do not like beans. The exceptions are peas, string beans, red adzuki beans (in paste form only; I do not like the tong sui, the sweet dessert soup) and black beans (in relation to Asian food). But being the fastidious bean eater that I am, I like this soup. It is thick, rich, and creamy that it warms your body from the frigid cold that is just outside. The ravioli is a nice contrast to the soup in ways that it is filled with ricotta cheese, which gives it a nice tang that differs from the earthy flavors of the bean soup.Giulia's calamari salad is actually done very well. The calamari (known as squid) is done just perfectly. It is just chewy enough that it does not have the texture of a rubber tire. The vinaigrette is a great addition to the salad and the calamari.Our main course: Giulia's Marinated Chicken Alla Griglia and my \"Grandmother's Meat Ravioli.\" When the server and set our food, all I saw was Giulia's All-Clad pan of chicken and lots of foam! Giulia's chicken was (as you can see) served in a stainless steel All-Clad cassoulet pan. She gave me a piece of her chicken and when I tasted it, it was perfectly cooked and well seasoned. I do not know what that foam tasted like, since the piece she gave me was devoid of foam. The other accouterments that accompanied her dish or pan, are potatoes and onions covered in pesto. She seemed satisfied with her chicken.My \"grandmother's\" ravioli was plated simply in a deep white bowl with a chunky tomato sauce with a sprinkling of chiffonade basil and Parmesan cheese. This deceptively simple plating actually let the ravioli's ingredients speak for themselves: the eggy pasta that enrobed the meat filling, consisting of beef, pork and veal. It is really delicious. Even it has gotten the approval from Giulia. She isn't a big meat eater but she does enjoy a good ravioli.And finally, dessert! Giulia's citrus tiramisu and my chocolate dessert. We first tried my dessert. I'm still kicking myself for not taking notes of the names of the plates and the menus online does not have it. *sighs* Anyways, the chocolate cake is dense and not moist but it has a caramel center to impart some moisture and walnuts on the bottom of the cake. A slight left of this photo, there are some cooked banana slices that tasted like it was flambéed since it had that soft zing in the end after we ate a banana slice with a nice crunchy exterior from the browning. To the far left, the banana ice cream. Even though it is a small quenelle, it is packed with lots of banana flavor. It just immediately screams \"banana!\" once it hits the tongue. It is also mixed in with walnuts that gives it a nice bitter contrast as well as a chocolate wafer cookie bottom that gives it a textural counterpoint.Another view of my dessertGiulia's citrus tiramisu looks deceivingly creamy and heavy but it is actually light and refreshing. Look at the photo below to see the airiness of this dessert.As I just stated, there's an ethereal lightness to this dessert that was truly unexpected for this dessert, in a traditional sense. Usually, it would be a mixture of marscapone cheese enriched with zabaglione (an egg custard) layered with espresso-soaked ladyfingers. This is basically a lighter reinterpretation that is executed well. I concur with Giulia saying that \"this would be a palate cleanser\" since there is grapefruit in the bottom of the dessert glass, as you will see the photo below.I really enjoy eating at this restaurant. Unfortunately, being a student does not help the fact that I can eat here all the time.After we paid the check. Giulia wanted some really great espresso (hence the title's mention of a double dose of espresso). I recommended Sicaffe. We took the subway uptown and had the Cappuccino Triestino ($3.64 for a doppio size). I did not take a photo of the drink since I've written about it a month or so ago but if you insist on seeing it, click here and scroll down the page to refresh your memory. Giulia liked this drink but she did not have the stomach capacity to finish it since we have our stomachs filled with a three course meal. Oh well. Next time when we hang out, she'll finish one.Today was really enjoyable. Good food and someone to eat with me. I just wish it was warmer...Cafe Grumpy 224 W 20th Street (bet. 7th & 8th Avenue) New York, NYA Voce 41 Madison Avenue (off 26th Street) New York, NYSicaffe 964 Lexington Avenue (between 70th & 71st Street) New York, NY

A Delicious Lunch at Café Sabarsky

***CONTENT
Those of you who have read my earlier posts around December, I wanted to go to Café Sabarsky for lunch. However the extremely long wait due to the fact that it was 12:30 and it was the holiday season, it was packed with people and I was about to faint from hunger. So, today I managed to get to eat there for lunch (finally!).I arrived there at 11:05 and I was hungry (I ate breakfast at 6 AM, mind you). Basically, you just enter the doors to the Neue Gallery and they check your bags and you enter Café Sabarsky on your right.Surprisingly, it was not as busy as I expected it to be. I just took a seat since there was no maître d' to sit anyone. The café was half full. Most of the diners were locals, two tables were filled with ladies who lunch or have a late breakfast, and a few tourists. The atmosphere really feels like an Old World, European (it's Austrian here) coffeehouse that feels elegant yet casual; not a stuffy, cold place that makes you feel unwelcome or feel like your being patronized on.When the waitress handed out the menu to me, I already know what I wanted to eat since I have been staring at the menu on their website that past weekend. I just glanced on it one more time to make sure it exists. By the time my waitress came back to my table, I told her I'll start with their coffee (\"kaffee\" is written on the menu) and the spätzle.When my coffee came in, it was served in a silver tray. I remember reading this from various reviews from the past years but I find it very unusual to be served like this but it is certainly most welcome. I should note that this cup of coffee costs $5. Yeah, it's pretty darn expensive (and it's not a latte or cappuccino) but it is certainly bold and strong tasting that it could almost pass off as a double espresso.A few minutes later came in my plate of spätzle ($15).To those of you who don't know what spätzle is, it's basically a German dumpling but Wikipedia has a better definition of this. This is Austrian comfort food to me. It's soft, creamy and cheesy; mixed in with corn, peas, and wild mushrooms. This made me forget the bone chilling, cold that exists outside the very windows I'm looking out from my seat. I would almost make this analogy of a gourmetized, European version of macaroni and cheese (I know it isn't, but it feels and tastes that way).After I finished my spätzle, they cleared my table and another server handed me the same menu but opened to the dessert page. I looked at that page and I was stuck at the many choices to pick for dessert. I know most of these cakes and pastries are delicious, as many restaurant reviewers from the past years claimed that they are. Eventually, I went for the traditional German-Austrian cake, the sachertorte ($7.50).SachertorteSide viewOk, a sachertorte is basically a chocolate cake filled with apricot jam or in this case here, apricot confiture, topped with a smooth chocolate ganache (Once again, read from Wikipedia for a better description or history of this cake.). When I took a bite of this cake, it was really good. The wonderful semisweet chocolate ganache topping (about 60%) meld with the moist chocolate cake and apricot confiture really well. The apricot was a nice tart contrast to the sweet chocolate. I thoroughly enjoyed this cake. I just wished I have room for more dessert! There's so many good pastries to choose from. Take a look below for a glimpse of other desserts on their dessert bar or table.I certainly felt full once I paid my check and stumbled my way out the door to 5th Avenue. Instead of taking the subway downtown to Midtown, I chose to walk 30 plus blocks to walk off my meal, even though it's 30 degrees (or about -1 degree Celsius) but I needed the exercise.Café Sabarsky 1048 5th Avenue (off 86th Street) New York, NY

In case you haven't noticed, I just have a bit too much time on my hands and I have a hankering for scones. I guess since it's too evasive to find a great scone when I tried to search for it last year, I decided to bake a batch now.Also the snow made me want to bake even more just because I'm stuck at home...except maybe digging it. *blech* Should I mention it's the first real snow ever since winter has started?I used Alton Brown's \"Dried Cherry Scones\" recipe from his book, I'm Just Here for More Food: Food x Mixing + Heat = Baking. Obviously, I replaced the dried cherries with the macerated raisins and orange zest.Did I ever tell you I love his show? It's quirky, funny and it's loaded with technical information on how and why you should do a certain technique, etc. It's basically the same for this book, hence why I bought this book (and I'm more of a baker than a cook).Onto the recipe! Don't worry, it's easy to make scones. I encourage you to bake some after you read the recipe and you have the liberty to create your own flavor, too.Dried Cherry Sconefrom I'm Just Here for More Food: Food x Mixing + Heat = Baking by Alton BrownYield: 8 sconesThe Dry Goods9 1/2 ounces (2 cups) All-purpose flour1/4 ounce (2 teaspoons) Baking powder1/4 ounce (3/4 teaspoon) Salt2 1/4 ounces (1/3 cup) SugarThe Fat3 ounces (6 tablespoons) cold Unsalted butterThe Liquid6 1/4 ounces (3/4 cup) chilled Heavy cream3 1/2 ounces (2 large) beaten EggsThe Extras3 ounces (1/3 cup) Dried Cherries (or in my case macerated raisins (same amount) by using a tablespoon of cognac and 1 tablespoon of orange zest)1. Place an oven rack in position C (the middle) and preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.2. Assemble the dough via the BISCUIT METHOD (see the following). Add the dried cherries (or raisins and zest) to the assembled dough and stir until just combined.Biscuit Method:1. Measure all ingredients. Chill or freeze all the Fats.2. Combine the Liquids and beat well.3. Take the Dry Goods, mix and move to a large bowl.4. Rub the Fats into the Dry Goods until about half the fat disappears and the rest is pea sized. Place the mixture into the freezer to keep it solid.5. Make a well in the center of the Dry Goods/Fats mixture. Pour the Wet Works into the well and quickly mix by using a rubber spatula or wooden spoon.6. Turn the mixture out onto a piece of wax paper or parchment - dusted with enough flour to make the dough manageable and knead briefly.7. Roll and pat out the dough into 1 inch thick round, cut and bake accordingly.3. Using a serrated bread knife, cut the round into 8 equal wedges. Place the wedges on an ungreased baking sheet about 1 inch apart.4. Bake the scones for 23 to 25 minutes, or until golden brown. Remove from the oven and place on a rack to cool. Serve at room temperature.Note: Keep in air-tight container for up to 3 days.Just a reminder to you all, this is my last posting about baking. Probably you're thinking, \"Finally!\" Yup, Monday I'm getting out of my house and start eating out and there's a ton of places that I want to try or eat. I just hope I have room in my stomach and still fit in my clothes...

The Easiest Chocolate Chip Cookies to Make...

in your LIFE! I recently bought The Weekend Baker from Amazon just because well...I want to. The recipes seem easy to make and it's very tempting to save lots of time.It's a nice change to my last post on the Chocolate Variation of Lady M's Mille Crêpes Cake. I don't have to kill two or more hours just for one little domed cake. These cookies took about a half hour to 45 minutes from start to finish. And all is from scratch. Now that's my kind of recipe. No fuss, it's a very familiar dessert to eat, and not much cleaning post-baking.You want the recipe, right? Read on!First thing, when you make these from your pot (the recipe is entitled \"One-pot Chocolate Chip Cookies) the batter looks greasy but that's normal. It'll come out perfectly fine. You get that buttery taste but not the grease. The texture of the cookies is basically chewy on the inside, crisp on the outside with a wonderful buttery flavor with a good ratio of nuts, chocolate and cookie.One-Pot Chocolate Chip CookiesMakes 26 cookiesFrom The Weekend Baker by Abigail Johnson Dodge8 tablespoons (4 ounces/113 grams) unsalted butter, cut into 4 pieces1/2 cup (4 ounces/113 grams) firmly packed light brown sugar1/3 cup (2 1/2 ounces/71 grams) granulated sugar1 1/2 cups (6 3/4 ounces/191 grams) all-purpose flour1 teaspoon baking powder1/4 teaspoon table salt1 large egg1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract1 cup (6 ounces/170 grams) semi-sweet chocolate chips (you may substitute white chocolate or bittersweet chocolate chips)1/2 cup (2 ounces/57 grams) coarsely chopped nuts (I used walnuts), optional1. Position an oven rack on the middle rung. Heat the oven to 350 degrees (180 degrees Celsius). Line 2 cookie sheets with parchment or nonstick baking liners (like Silpat).2. Put the batter in a medium saucepan and set over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the butter is melted. Slide the pan from the heat and add the brown sugar and granualted sugar. Whisk until no lumps remain. Set aside to let cool, about 5 minutes.3. In a medium bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, and salt. Whisk until well blended. Once the butter mixture has cooled, add the egg and vanilla and whisk until blended. Pour in the flour mixture and stir with a rubber spatula until well blended. Stir in the chocolate chips and the nuts, if using.4. Using a small ice cream scoop (about 1 2/3 inches/4.25 cm in diameter) or 2 tablespoons, drop scant 2-tablespoon mounds of the dough onto the prepared cookie sheets, arranging them about 1 1/2 inches (4 cm) apart. (At this point, the loaded cookie sheets can be slipped into the freezer until the cookies are frozen, about 1 hour. Then transfer the cookies to heavy-duty freezer bags and freeze up to 3 months. To bake, remove from the freezer, arrange on lined cookie sheets, and leave on the counter to thaw slightly while the oven heats.)5. Bake 1 sheet at a time (make sure to use a cooled sheet for the second batch) until the cookies are light golden around the edges and puffed, about 12 minutes. If these cookies are overbaked, they won't come out chewy. Transfer the cookie sheet to a rack to cool for about 10 minutes. Using a spatula, lift the cookies from the sheet onto a rack and let cool completely.

A \"Light\" Lunch Caffé Falai

Caffé Falai, located on Lafayette and Bleecker, third and most recent Falai establishment that is owned by Iacopo Falai. I have chosen this place to eat for lunch not primarily for the real food but more in the desserts arena since, if you haven't noticed, I love desserts, and many food lovers claimed that he creates awesome baked goods. So why not go there?This place is actually a small café. There's ten tables and the bar, as seating area. The open kitchen is extremely small that I wonder sometimes how can they create such exquisite looking and more importantly, tasting food. The interior is done entirely in white. The walls, floor, tables, chairs and the bar is white. The chandeliers that hang above the bar are beautiful; it reminds me of a miniature version from Anthropologie. (Yes, I know I have a strange addiction to Anthropologie.) The service is really awful. Right from the very start from seating myself to the actual ordering, it took my waitress a good five minutes. There were two waitresses in the beginning, the one she had seem to do the most work, yet works in a passive attentive way. To clarify that, if she is at your table you will have her attention for that minute, after that you will be tentatively ignored unless you call her attention or she will appear at your table five to ten minutes later. Other service flaws, even though I ordered from a savory pastry and a cake, I was not served any bread. I realized that much later on after I finished my cake.The pastry/dessert menu (Click on the photo for a slightly larger view)The latte was ok. There wasn't much crema and the espresso was a bit too bitter for a latte and lacking that smoothness that I've encounter from Ninth Street Espresso. It was doable for $3.Anyways, the food. The savory pastry I was referring to is a spinach and ricotta cheese in a puff pastry - as stated on the menu. It looks colorful and gooey... the cheese is oozing out of that flaky puff pastry. Did I mention I love gooey cheese? Actually, I haven't met a cheese that I haven't liked yet. The pastry is flaky, dusted with cinnamon and nutmeg on the exterior; the innards are packed with a gooey, creamy, ricotta cheese sauce with a ton of spinach, raisins and pignoli nuts (also known as pine nuts). The combination of flavors is quite interesting. You get your savory (ricotta cheese sauce and spinach), sweet (raisins) and spicy (cinnamon and nutmeg). The pignoli nuts gave it some crunch. The only flaw on this pastry is that the cheese sauce has that pasty, flour aftertaste. Possibly they undercooked their roux. It's good but not mind blowing greatness. The good part is that it's filling and not that expensive, it was $3.Next up, the Spring Dome. According to the menu, it was stated simply, \"pistachio cake, strawberry puree and citrus creme.\" It tasted like it is stated. The cream was slightly sweet and citrusy. The center is more like a strawberry gelée with little bits of chocolate on the bottom of it. The cake was pistachio and and citrusy but it didn't contribute much to the texture or flavor unless I eat in individually. This reminds of Payard's cake that I had a couple of months ago but it tastes a lot better than Payard even though it is not as beautiful. But still not an earth shattering experience. This dome costs $5.It's a nice place to eat a good, fairly inexpensive meal. Even though my intentions was to eat a light lunch but it was really caloric and fattening but it was delicious. Heck, I'll try their chocolate croissant next time since a customer there who is a self proclaimed chocoholic said that, \"all their chocolates [pastries] are good.\" That's my next mission when I come here next time.

I'm thinking I'm possibly one of the minuscule number of food bloggers in New York City who ate at Momofuku Ssäm for the first time. I know, I'm a sad case. Anyways, it's always cool to have two friends to eat out with: Julie and Robyn. But before I get to that, earlier in the morning I went to Whole Foods in Union Square for a mid-morning breakfast. Just be warned, this is going to be a looong post since I'm not planning to eat anything interesting for the rest of the week. I think I lost some readers here...oops.I'm feeling quasi-healthy for some reason but I'm presuming my subconscious is trying to justify my future gluttony with Robyn and Julie. Eeh...who knows really? I bought two items: an 8% milkfat yogurt from Liberte and Kashi's Dark Chocolate Oatmeal Cookie. The latter item was definitely weird just because I'm not really into Kashi's food in general, I just find their granola bars pretty good but nothing else really. Also with the fact that it's a \"healthy\" cookie, I don't really buy into that advertising; honestly I find that it would be bull to buy a lowfat or fat-free, no cholesterol sugar-free cookie. It usually tastes like cardboard or that it tastes like chemicals...ewww. First, let's see the yogurt.Unmixed...MixedThe yogurt's pretty good but not as great as Fage. It was definitely creamy but it lacked that intense thickness and tang Fage has. The flavor of plum and walnut was subtle. The walnut was finely chopped so the occasional crunchy toothsomeness is there. It's nice but I still love Fage yogurt more.The Kashi cookie...A line of cookiesClose up of the cookie InnardsIt looks wholesome, it looks like a cookie, and it smells like it has more fibery grains are in there than your typical pre-packaged cookie. It does look dry and it tastes a bit dry too. It tastes like a mix of grainy, quite dry, wholesome granola bar with some chocolate chips. Not my ideal cookie. It tastes too healthy to be a cookie. Next time if I ever have that cookie craving at that moment, I would just pick up a cookie from Whole Foods bakery (it's pretty darn tasty but sometimes it's inconsistent with the moisture content). After eating and tasting these things, I went over to Joe for a cup of cappuccino for two reasons: 1. Hoping their cappuccino is good as Ninth Street Espresso's and 2. I just want one. The cappuccino still looks somewhat similar to what I can recall drinking their stuff but possibly a bit more milky. When I took a sip, it's confirmed that I have lost Joe...this is a sad moment. I think I have to leave Joe after 5 years of a good coffee relationship. [sniffles] Well, at least their drip coffee is good. So basically if I have an espresso craving, I'll go to Ninth Street, and for drip it's Joe's.Fooding with Robyn and JulieGoing back to the more interesting part of this post, I ate out with Robyn and Julie at Momofuku Ssäm.Originally I thought this place would have table service but you actually order at the counter. Since it was the day, the menu's severely limited to ssäms, a rice bowl, and steamed pork buns, as you will see here. All three of us ordered the original Momofuku ssäm but Robyn also ordered the steamed pork buns as well. It was pretty damn shocking how much pork they add into EVERY FOOD that involves with pork. To let you know what the heck I'm talking about, click here to see my Flickr set on the making of the ssäm below) and how they build the pork buns, click here for my Flickr set.The pork bun was one messy, little (but plump) bugger.The photo's been taken by JulieIt was a soft, chewy, porky, and sweet and sour from the pickled cucumber and kewpie slaw. As I said, messy but tasty. As for the photo above, it's my hands holding that ever messy bun. I asked Julie to take a photo of it, using my camera, since obviously it'll be a mess.It's HUGE! Probably the length of me forearm...Overstuffed ssäm...it's busted out of its pancake shell.The ssäm was delicious! It was soft (flour pancake and rice), sweet (berkshire pork (yes, meat can be sweet, too)), sour (pickled shitake and red kimchee), a bit of a spicy kick (from the kimchee), and it's totally FILLING. This might sound corny but it's Momofukin' good!I can't finish the whole thing neither can Robyn. We both finish about half our ssäms but Julie forced upon herself to eat the whole thing. Poor girl...I think she said after eating the whole thing she said \"I feel like a burrito.\" Hahaha...I asked if I could quote her, and I got permission to write that...We just sat, chat a good bit about food, hoping to digest some of your pork-filled ssäm stomachs as time marches on... Me being me, I took some photos of Robyn and Julie consuming their food, also the second photo of Robyn looks like she wants to either kill me or she'll have her revenge on me one day...Here's Julie...Here's Robyn...Can't you see that mischievous smirk she has...?As we left, I really thought to myself that Dave Chang (the owner and chef of the place) loves and respects pork. I mean, I haven't have pork this tasty and melt-in-your-mouth good unless it was cooked by my parents (specifically, my dad). Also taking in account what Robyn ate last Thursday with a bunch of other people, as you read here. Basically the focus of her meal then was that pork butt. Oooh...squishy, yummy pork meat and fat. Actually, that how I felt too...piggy and squishy (from fat).Ever since I met Robyn, you probably see me eat more ice cream or any frozen creamy, dairy product more often that I would normally do. So, we discussed amongst ourselves wondering if we're up for some frozen creamy delights...and we did. Since I already ate at Sundaes & Cones, I suggested that we should try Australian Homemade's ice cream since none of us ever has and we're curious.Our soon-to-be victimsWell, the price isn't so bad and tasting a few flavors, this place seems promising in the ice cream department. The strange this is seeing this: \"No More Chocolates\"?! WTF?! Thankfully, we're not here for their chocolate, just the ice cream. We each ordered a small cup of pistachio (Robyn), Belgian Chocolate (Julie), and Mocha (Moi). This is sort of our tapas tastings of ice cream, if you will. Basically, we tried a sampling of each others' ice cream and nosh away.All were creamy, silky and smooth in texture and none were cloyingly sweet. Robyn's pistachio ice cream tasted \"floral-y\"...in her words when she first tasted it, and that's the same reaction I had too but we both can't seem to point out what the heck that flavor's from. When Julie tasted it, she said it tasted like almond extract. Oooooh! She's brilliant, man! This is a shame to us (Robyn and myself) foodies/food bloggers. [put head down in shame...] Julie's Belgian chocolate tasted chocolatey; the nice addition was the tiny bits of chocolate that was mixed throughout the chocolate ice cream. Mmmm...you get a double dose of chocolate. Swweet! As for my mocha, it's good. A good balance of coffee and chocolate flavors in the ice cream.Once we're done with our ice cream...we're totally stuffed. Our stomachs were a full of pork ssäm and frozen dairy goodness. I felt that have to be rolled out of the store. Later on, we went up to Union Square for Robyn's need of some fruit in her apartment and after that, Julie bade goodbye since she has to go home and write a paper. I joined Robyn and went to her apartment in Curry Hill.Meeting Jo Jo and LotusThis led me to the introduction to Robyn's roommate, Jo Jo and her cat Lotus. I sort of know Jo Jo through Flickr but this is the real first meeting of her in person. She's really cool and I liked her eclectic dishes and cups...it reminds me of Anthropologie's stuff. And here's Lotus... The last photo was her staring at me...possibly wondering, who the hell am I? This is one interesting cat to get to know. Robyn told me odd stories that Lotus can't eat citrus fruits in the morning or without any food to pad her digestive system.Even though Jo Jo told us that she's been fed, we noticed that Lotus is keep nosing around my bag that contains my other half of the ssäm that I saved...that is not a good thing since Jo Jo said that the pork molecules are too large for a cat's capillaries. Obviously, I don't want to kill a cat that I just met so I'm not going feed her my ssäm. Then, Robyn started playing with the idea of feeding her with a tangerine...and that's what she did.Robyn peeling a tangerine, Lotus staring at Robyn's hands...Lotus wants the bright orange tangerine...She got it and somehow manage to eat it off Robyn's mat.For the remaining 40 minutes that I lingered around Robyn and Jo Jo's apartment, I just watched that darn cat...hoping she will take a nap and snag a photo of her sleeping. However, it's almost impossible. The cat is a shallow sleeper; any movement or sound you make, she wakes up. This cat is funny and weird. Sometimes I feel that cat's mocking me, too. Hmm... :/Moishe's BakeryThis morning I wandering around the East Village and remembering what Robyn has tipped/asking me about Moishe's Bakery. I haven't been there before but I always had that intention of going, so I decided I might as well go. Here's the display window shots: I ended up ordering a poppy hamantaschen for a mind blowing price of $1.50. Eventually, I ended up going to Whole Foods in Union Square just because they have seating and I wanted to try their cappuccino as well. The cappuccino was too milky. Thankfully, it's more diluted than Joe's or I think Hell froze over. Even though, it was a wasted $3 small cappuccino, but at least I know how the standards are around WF's coffee. Their drip coffee is good when I drank it a few times in the Columbus Circle location. Anyways, the hamantaschen. It's a dense, buttery, shortbread-like cookie with a huge blob of toasted poppy seed filling in the center. It's delicious and I think it clogged my arteries even further and that cookie is probably 800 calories...oh, boy.Addresses: Whole Foods 40 E 14th St New York, NYJoe the Art of Coffee 9 E 13th St New York, NYMomofuku Ssäm 207 2nd Ave New York, NYAustralian Homemade 115 Saint Marks Place New York, NY

That CC cookie is too healthy!  [PUNCHES COOKIE]  Yeah, that'll show it.That other half of the ssam made a really good dinner.  Uughghghhgtenderfattypork.  I wouldn't mind that second photo of me so much if it didn't make my arm look the same size as my head.  AHHH.  I will have my revenge.Oh, Lotus puked today.  Now I know what kitty vomit looks like.  ...Just a really tiny puddle of mush.LOTUS DOESN'T SLEEP OMG.As for the \"no more chocolate\" sign, did you overhear when the woman said that they were just rubber samples or something?  Cos they really had no more chocolate?  I do find that odd.Don't you feel like dying after eating that butter-tastic hamentashen?  MMM!  So good.  I'm glad you tried it.  :D

That CC is waay too healthy...but I have to eat it since I paid for it. :/I'm anticipating some kind of vengeance from you some day. I was expecting payback from you the same day but it didn't happen. Oh well...I did overhear that they don't have anymore chocolate. It's very weird, especially since this store specializes in chocolate and ice cream. Hmmm...Argh...after I ate that butter-bomb of a hamentashen, I felt full the entire day (that was my mid-morning snack) until dinner. It was good but wow that fat, man. Thanks for the tip. :)

oh man, you girls know how to have fun! great post!\"I really thought to myself that Dave Chang loves and respects pork\" haha... that's a good one!the worst about the \"healthy cookies\" is that they contain similiar amount of kcal that the  regular ones, so it makes them just stupid :)poor Lotus, is she sick or something? my friends' cats don't have problems with food like that (as far as i know)
hellokitty893112
2007-02-22 10:52:00
Haha...but it's true! Even the chief writer of the NY Times says that too! He said, \"David Chang is a terrific cook, a pork-loving, pickle-happy individualist...\" So I'm not alone on this thought!I totally agree with you that the \"healthy\" cookie has about the same or more kcals as a regular cookie. That's why I'm just sticking to the regular stuff. I still don't know why I bought it...?Lotus is fine...she's just a weird cat. End of story.

Hordes in Chinatown: Chinese New Year Eve, and Mom's Turnip Cake

Being either stupid or brave, I went to Chinatown yesterday. In ways it was kind of stupid because of the hordes of people in Chinatown because it's Chinese New Year's Eve. (I should say, \"Gong Hay Fat Choy\" (in Cantonese), \"Gong Xi Fa Cai\" (transliterated in Mandarin), or 新年 愉快). I'm just brave enough to walk or sometimes shove my way through the crowds. It's a zoo there. The reasons why I wanted to go to Chinatown were the food and the Flower Market.I went to the Flower Market in Columbus Park first since I'm hoping it won't be packed and the flowers will be fresher during the earlier part of the day.So here's my photoset in Flickr that you may click through. The food's after the jump.I didn't really get real food I just want to snack on some stuff just because later on the evening, I have to go to my cousin Amanda's wedding (which will be briefly talked about on the next post). I randomly went in and out to different bakeries just looking at what they have and see if it appeals to me. However, the one I really wanted to go to, 9 Chatham Square, was packed with people that there's no more standing room in the restaurant, and the others were not tempting me to eat their stuff.Eventually, I went into Golden Dragon Boat Café since there was seating and their food is not bad.I ended up getting an egg custard tart (dan tat) and a deep fried sesame seed ball (jien duy) for a mind blowing total of $1.35.Here's the food photos:The egg custard tart was good. The crust was slightly buttery, crumbly, and sweet. The custard was smooth, creamy and sweet. Not mind blowing greatness but it alleviate my egg custard tart craving. The deep fried sesame ball was even better. Why? It's because their kitchen is making copious amounts of these fried balls of goodness since it's Chinese New Year Eve.Sesame seed ball (jien duy) has a symbolic meaning for prosperity for the new year. Even though these are available year-round but it has more significance for the next 2 weeks (since Chinese New Year is usually celebrated as a 15 day holiday).Another new year food would be these:These containers are filled with fa gao which means \"prosperity cakes.\" It's basically a steamed cake that comes in the basic yellow from the eggs or dyed to a pinkish red, occasionally topped with a cherry or a red dot.Speaking of food, my mom made some homemade turnip cakes (lo bak gao) a few days ago. This is what I always look forward to every Chinese New Year ever since my mom know how to make these from scratch (about a decade).Turnip cakes are served on New Year's Day as a symbol of prosperity and rising fortune, the gao is a homonym for the Chinese word for tall or high, so you'll want to dig into this dish if you're hoping to grow taller or move up the corporate ladder. My mom makes this with soaked rice instead of the traditional rice flour, the turnip (or known as daikon) dried shrimp, ground pork and reconstituted shitake mushrooms. It is first cooked in a wok slightly, to get the rice batter and the filling a bit thickened then it's steamed. The option is pan frying but my mom prefers it steamed.Take a look at the turnip cake:

Oddity at Valentine's, Taralucci e Vino, Blackhound, and Mandoos!

It's been an odd few days. On Valentine's Day, it snowed (kind of ironic?) and I have classes. Why?! It's bad enough that it snowed and rained ice pellets that literally blows in your face since it was so windy. But still, I have to schlep my behind to the city and be in school. Grrr...Sorry...I want to vent. Well, on Valentine's Day during my lunch hour, I walked over to the Time Warner Building and went to Whole Foods for some of their soup and a salad. Oddly enough, the lines were still awfully long during the lunch hour, it looks like the snow never happened. Since those foods don't look so gloriously amazing, I'm not going to write anything about it. I just want to comment on the fact that it was really humorous that there were a lot of men buying flowers in WF. I felt kind of sorry for the two women who were working in the floral department; rearranging or creating bouquets for the desperate men who thought at the last moment to buy flowers and gifts for their significant other.Since I wanted dessert, I went up to the fourth floor to Bouchon Bakery. Those of you who look at my Flickr gallery, you know what I ate: the pomegranate tart ($7.25). The three reasons that lured me into buying this tart was that it was seasonal, it was whimsical and pretty looking, and the way the employee described that tart made it sound amazingly good.The tart is a butter pastry crust, embedded with pomegranate seeds on the bottom layer, topped with pomegranate ganache, with quenelles of whipped cream with an essence of Madagascar vanilla, with spiral pomegranate cookies on top. Tell me how can you not be sold into buying one of these babies!But there were little flaws in this tart...unfortunately. The spiral cookie was getting a bit soft due to the refrigeration and the pomegranate ganache lacked that signature tartness of the pomegranate. In a way the seeds that are beneath this ganache actually helped it to bring more of that pomegranate into the party. It was still very delicious, overall. I apologize about the above photo; they only provide you meager plastic flatware to eat your food with and since this crust is very crisp (and buttery), it ended up looking like this.Yesterday morning, I needed espresso. Since I don't own those fancy $1,000 machines and a $5o0 coffee grinder that make a great shot and coffee ground, I wanted to try a different coffeehouse for their espresso drinks. This led me to Ninth Street Espresso.I have heard a lot about this place for the past recent years. The reason why I haven't been here before because the locations were too far from where I go to school or eat often. Since they have a new location on 13th Street, it's more accessible now.The vibe in this place is actually causal-cool. It's a minimally decorated place. The white painted brick walls, lined with posters about plays. The seating is basically four tall tables with stools to sit on as well as the counter is along the poster-plastered wall.Their coffee menu is really limited: only espresso based drinks, and no drip coffee here. Also they provide you with one size for your drink: not like Starbucks where you can get a tall, grande or venti. This seems purely traditional in the sense of the Italian way of coffee.The pastries they offer are from Tisserie. They do look quite tempting but I wanted to pass since I'm planning to eat dessert for lunch.But I have to tell you, they have some really fabulously great cappuccino!The espresso was strong, smooth, bold, and it has great crema. Adding that leaf design is a plus, too. Not bad for $3.50. This might jeopardize my long term relationship with Joe (of almost 5 years).For lunch, I went to Taralucci e Vino. I've been here once before just for their croissant (and it was to-go), so I wanted to try their real food.Their interior is really spacious: a large bar with baked goods and sandwiches displayed, a few tables lining the opposite of the bar and a large table in the back.I took a seat at the front end of the café/restaurant and ordered their bresaola, arugula, and speck panini ($8.95) and a chocolate tart ($5). Problems with their service: they didn't provide me a glass of water (since I requested it) until after 3 minutes of eating my sandwich. My first waiter looked over at my direction and noticed that I haven't gotten my water, and he said \"sorry.\"Here's the sandwich:The panini was very good. The ciabatta bread was perfectly crisp and fresh, the meats, cheese and arugula worked together nicely. The side salad was dressed to the right amount of vinaigrette.The dessert:My question to you is, do you see anything wrong with this tart? If your answer is \"yes\" then you are correct. The first telling of there was a problem with this tart was that the chocolate has bloom on it. I was trying to oversee that flaw and hoping that it was just the chocolate, not the tart would be an issue. However, when I actually cut into the crust, it was soft and crumbly, and when I ate it, the crust was tasted funny. It tasted odd and I kept thinking to myself, \"is it really stale?\" Eventually, I asked my waitress that was there anything in the crust that made it taste...different? She asked, \"Do you mean vanilla or hazelnut?\" I replied, \"No...something nutty but not hazelnut.\" She said she'll find out for me and eventually she came back with the answer that it was just a \"sugar dough crust.\" When she told me that I was a bit ticked off. I just let it go since I don't want to waste anymore of my time with this place and just paid for the tasty sandwich and the disappointing tart.Since my sweet tooth was unsatisfied, I walked over to the East Village to Blackhound.I've seen their gorgeous cakes numerous times whenever I go to Dean & Deluca (which is rare anyways). When I glanced on their window display, I saw these...How can I possibly pass up on these?! So I went in. The two people who were working there were really nice and helpful, they were also stocking up the bakery. I thought it was kind of odd at this time of the day since it's about 1:30 PM. Anyways, it took me a good 5 minutes figuring what the heck do I want. Everything looks fabulous to eat but I could only eat one. Oh the choices...oh my stomach! I mean, could you even just pick one thing and be satisfied with it? Just take a look...(click on it for a larger photo)The cake is basically a white cake, layered with raspberry jam, marzipan, and sliced almonds. It is then enrobed with tempered bittersweet (about 65%) chocolate, vanilla buttercream \"ribbon\", fresh raspberries, and an orange marzipan flower. Yummy...this totally made up for that disgraceful tart. Heck, I want to go back to Blackhound and get their mini Busy Bee Cake.Towards the late afternoon-evening time, I went to Kim's office in Midtown East. Since her boss is out of town and her co-worker left early, she let me drop by early. I gave her homemade chocolate dessert presents for her half-birthday. It's basically the stuff I made from this post (sans the hot chocolate but I gave her a shot glass of that ganache, anyways) and a chocolate parfait done by my own interpretation. I just took a random photo of her on the computer but she ended up posing.It gotten a bit complicated for our planned dinner destination after picking up our Juilliard concert tickets. Originally she picked either Fika or the Burger Joint. But then she wasn't feeling for either one of those things and she thought up of wanting to eat dumplings at Mandoo Bar.I just liked the fact that they have open windows to show the cooks making these mandoos and have trays displaying them.Here the dolsot bimibob:It looked really awesome...and that stone pot is rocket-hot that it was radiating heat, warming our table. This pot is filled with rice, topped with a raw egg, julienned cucumber, carrots, daikon (an Asian turnip), watercress, bean sprouts, and I think it's mushroom (the brown stringy stuff)? The waiter asked us if we wanted him to mix it for us or we should do it ourselves; we opted for the latter. But about less than a minute, we had second thoughts about putting our hands on that skin-searing pot and asked them to mix it for us.

Oh, as much as I love any type of sweets I worry that I'll have health problems down the road...but life's too short to worry about it. I love Blackhound Bakery. It's a good thing I don't live near there before I'll visit them every morning and bring a couple of cakes and tarts with me...Oh, that would be bad.Thanks for the compliment (on the photo) but I don't think it would be a good thing since it might induce hunger whenever you look at your screen ;)

Lunch and Dessert at the \"Bakeries\" of Famous Chefs

***CONTENT
The \"bakeries\" I'm referring to are Bouley Bakery (owned by David Bouley; located in TriBeca) and Bouchon Bakery (owned by Thomas Keller, in Columbus Circle). I don't know why I happen to go to these famous chefs' moderately priced establishments, but I did.Lunch was at Bouley Bakery. I ordered a slice of their Tomato & Mushroom Quiche ($4.50), an Eclipse ($5.25), and a Chocolate Cupcake ($1.95). I know what you're thinking; possibly you might be wondering why the heck did I order two desserts? It's just that I want to and since Valentine's Day is tomorrow, I might as well indulge with chocolate desserts.Here's what my order looked like. Bouley Bakery has tables on the sidewalk but since it is cold, they let you sit upstairs where they normally have the restaurant named Upstairs, that runs during the evening hours for dinner.The tables...The kitchen; UpstairsIt's quite small in size. The kitchen takes up half the space available. It would be awesome to see the maestro actually cook in front of you but that of course, will be a pretty steep price to have a cooking class with him.Anyways, the food. The quiche was delicious. It had enough cheese and egg to make it creamy and luscious. It was well seasoned and it had a good amount of custard that it isn't too overwhelming to the stomach. The large tomato was fresh and ripe, even though it was slightly roasted in the oven. It also had a copious amount of mushrooms embedded in the quiche (as you will see below). My only complaint with this quiche is that the crust is a bit too thin to hold the filling. Every time I cut a small piece, stab it with my fork, and try to lift it to my mouth, that small bit falls apart. Next up, the Eclipse pastry. It looks decadently chocolatey and reading their description on the tag that was displayed in their pastry case and their menu that says, \"Chocolate sablé with fleur de sel caramel ganache, chocolate sabayon and salted white chocolate\" sounds awfully tempting to eat and purchase. Here's the innards shots: The chocolate sablé (a French version of the shortbread cookie) itself, was good. It wasn't very sweet, good chocolate flavor, and it was crisp. The fleur de sel caramel ganache was an light, whipped ganache that initially tasted salty that ended with a slightly sweet chocolate finish on the palate. Interestingly complex but not blown away from it. The chocolate sabayon and the salted white chocolate just contributed to the saltiness of the ganache but nothing much from there. The pastry was overall, good. Not mind blowing good that I think I've reached an epiphany with chocolate desserts. The pastry sounded very fancy with interesting combinations of flavor, but I don't think it worked too well for me.The chocolate cupcake seem to outdo the Eclipse surprisingly. Here's the photos of the cupcake:Top, angled view Cupcake split in halfThe cake was moist, tender, and not really sweet. The frosting was possibly chocolate buttercream. I said \"possibly\" because when I tasted the frosting alone, it reminded me of whipped chocolate ganache; the butter flavor wasn't really detectable. The frosting was sweet and chocolatey. Those little round chocolate balls (of puffed rice, it seemed) sprinkled on top gave the cupcake a nice crunch instead of having it tender and soft throughout.Later on the afternoon, I was still early for my classes so I went to Bouchon Bakery for their macarons and coffee. I inquired what macaron flavors were available and the young lady who helped me said they had the \"Traditional,\" which is consisted of chocolate, caramel and coffee. As for their seasonal flavors, which somehow she called it \"Holiday\" flavors, were coconut, passionfruit and blood orange. Since I tasted the traditional flavors from here, I opted for the seasonal. Here's the trio... The first macaron I tried was the coconut. The cookie is soft, lots of coconut flavor, as well as chewing a good amount of coconut flakes, and the filling is a bit on the scant side.The blood orange...Split in halfSomehow, it didn't go too well. The cookie had too much toasted almond flavor, instead of blood orange. I know that macarons are made from almond flour or almond paste, but usually it's muted with a different flavor to take its place. The blood orange flavor only came through from the filling, which was a really sharp, sour tang. (It's normal, for those of you who have never eaten a blood orange.) It's not my favorite of the three.The passionfruit macaron fared a lot better. It had passionfruit flavor throughout the cookie with an essence of toasted almonds. It was chewy and soft, with a very thin crisp from the crust. I really like this one a lot. These three macarons cost me $8.25, or so. I don't remember the exact amount but it was about that much.That's all folks! Happy Valentine's Day! (for those of you who care about this so-called holiday). I'll be pigging out on chocolate or chocolate desserts; not really caring about the holiday or anyone special. On Thursday, I'll be spoiling a friend of mine with a ridiculous amount of chocolate based desserts for her \"quarter birthday.\" Why a quarter birthday, you ask? Well, ever since she saw my chocolate crepe cake post, she wanted it for her half birthday. Also the fact that I'll be busy with papers and tests around April, I might as well celebrate a quarter birthday just to be early rather than never or an IOU. If you get my drift...

That cupcake looks awesome.  [stomach gurgles]  Those macs look alright too (and cost about the same as Tisserie's, mrah!)  I love passion fruit ones.TOMORROW IS CHOCOLATE PIG OUT DAY YEY!

Robyn - The cupcake was basically the best thing from Bouley. Eh, I'm getting disappointed in the macaron scene in NYC. The only two spots that are good are only Bouchon Bakery and La Maison du Chocolat; and I know it's not on par with Parisian macs.Anyways, yes! Chocolate pig out day is totally on! Hopefully, I don't die from chocolate glutton...

Kathy - I think we like the same foods. I know there's some things I haven't tried that she has tried and vice versa (e.g. I haven't tried the Japanese dish of eel and rice). That sucks that there's only one bakery in Claremont. There's no democracy...Edyta - Haha...I think it is dangerous to read food blogs since there's a good amount of food photos that make you hungry. When it comes to my blog, there's usually some chocolate written.

I know the advent of Valentine's Day is the next few days. Not that I care about the romantic affiliations with Valentine's Day; I just use this holiday to eat a lot of chocolate. That's my kind of holiday! (Except for Chinese New Year, which is coming next Sunday...)Since I have no classes today, I managed to spend my afternoon making all confections dealing with chocolate. I know...I have issues but I'm not the only one who is ingesting all of these goods: the gianduja hot chocolate, gianduja chocolate stuffed figs, and the traditional truffle. No, no! I'm not talking about the fungus that pigs dig out from the ground I'm talking about these...If you're actually skeptical about the chocolate stuffed figs, here's what it looks like.Since I'm not going to kill you with all of those recipes, basically you have the \"master\" ganache, which is basically in the following recipe. I just took the liberty of changing it as my own by adding hazelnut praline paste (which you may find in your local grocery or health store; I bought mine in Whole Foods) into the ganache. So here's the recipe for the figs.Chocolate Stuffed FigsPure Chocolate by Fran Bigelow.1 cup heavy cream8 ounces semisweet (I used bittersweet Calebaut) chocolate, finely chopped24 to 36 dried Calimyra (or Turkish) figs, depending on size1 1/2 pounds semisweet chocolate tempered (optional)1. Have ready a 9 x 13 inch sheet pan lined with parchment (or wax) paper.2. In a saucepan, heat the cream over medium-high heat just until it begins to boil. Remove from the heat. Add the finely chopped chocolate. Stir until smooth with a rubber spatula. Pour the mixture into a bowl, cover with plastic wrap touching the top, and let set for 6 to 8 hours at room temperature.3. Prepare figs for stuffing by gently rolling between your thumb and fingers to loosen the seeds and soften the flesh. Insert a wooden or metal skewer in the hole in the bottom of the fig and wiggle it to enlarge the hole slightly for stuffing.4. When the ganache is set, gently stir with a rubber spatula a few times. Spoon into a pastry bag fitted with a small round 1/4-inch tip (#803).5. Hold each fig's stem gently between your index and middle fingers, using your thumb to support the plump fruit. Insert the tip of the pastry bag into the fig's bottom. Gently squeeze, stuffing until the fig is plump and full. Do not worry about leaks in the fig's skin. They can be fixed later.6. Place filled figs on a parchment (or wax paper) lined pan and allow to set at room temperature for at least 2 hours. Using a sharp knife, scrape the excess filling from each fig's exterior. Stuffed figs can be stored in a sealed container in the refrigerator. Remove and return to room temperature for eating-or dipping, if desired.7. For the dipping option, follow the tempering instructions from the link. To dip, hold the fig by the stem, dip the bottom half of each fig in the tempered chocolate. Place the dipped fruit on a parchment-lined pan and let the chocolate set. With a pair of sharp scissors, snip off the very tip of each stem, which is too tough to be eaten before serving.As for the chocolate truffle, you take the ganache recipe and use a small spoon or melon baller and scoop out a small amount of ganache (say about the size of a walnut). Place it in an aluminum or parchment lined sheet pan and repeat until you use up all the ganache, and refrigerate for 10 to 20 minutes until firm.While you're waiting for the ganache to chill, chop about 12 ounces (in weight) of bittersweet or semisweet chocolate and temper (use the link from the fig recipe, to temper). Take out the ganache from the refrigerator and dip the ganache ball into the tempered chocolate, thinly coating it. (The whole purpose of the melted chocolate is for the cocoa powder to cling onto the ball of ganache.)Once you coat, then you place it into a bowl or shallow plate of cocoa powder and coat it with cocoa powder. Do not remove this truffle from the bowl yet.The melted chocolate has not set; just go on to the next ganache ball and repeat.Once you coat this truffle in the cocoa powder, then you take the first truffle and place it onto the lined sheet pan. Repeat until all is cocoa-ed. Chill the truffles (with the sheet pan) in the refrigerator for 10 minutes, until the chocolate has set then serve.One last note, the hot chocolate is made basically by using that ganache and add milk (to the desired thickness/amount) into a saucepan, heat it over medium heat and stir with a whisk to remove any lumps. Once it comes to a simmer, just pour into a mug and enjoy.

I'm referring to my \"diet.\" It seems that I fall into the trap of eating bad every Tuesday or Thursday, just because I have time before classes that I just wander around and end up finding something to eat that isn't good for me. Oh...whatever. I'm not going to try that hard for the sake of beauty or vanity. It's just not worth it. As long as I'm not gaining anything, that's fine with me.For mid-morning snack, I went down to TriBeca to Tribeca Treats for their cupcakes since I heard about them recently from the press and I remembered their booth back in the Chocolate Show the past November. I don't know what really drove me to go down there but I did it.The cupcake is adorable but tiny for $2.17 (yes, they charged tax). The cake itself is moist, chocolatey and a touch of sweetness since the marshmallow buttercream frosting is quite sweet and it does taste like a marshmallow. The graham cracker crumbs really didn't contribute much to the cupcake. It's almost undetectable in flavor or texture. The cupcake is good but it's a bit expensive for what you get.For lunch, I went to the East Village to Chickpea.For some reason, I just wanted some falafel or shawarma. The good thing about this place is that you get the best of both worlds: the shawafel. I had the lamb shawafel, instead of the chicken; my beverage of choice is the lemonata.The shawafel is delicious! Crispy balls of mashed fava beans (not chickpeas, since they're obviously green), lamb shawarma, a miscellany of vegetables, and few slices of pickles and red onion, smothered into a pita bread. Yummy and quite filling, too. The lemonata was refreshing and sweetened to the right amount. The problem is that I still wanted dessert. I know, I know. I had a cupcake earlier in the morning but I still wanted something sweet. I just got out of Chickpea, when the lunch crowd started to pack in (and that's around 1 PM) and walked around the East Village.When I saw a large sign from Sundaes & Cones, my brain lit up and said, \"Ice cream!\"I don't know if this whole obsession or cravings of frozen, sweet and creamy desserts is due to Robyn's influence. When I went there, I was the only customer. No surprise since it's 27 degrees with a windchill of 13 degrees Fahrenheit. I think I'm the only nutjob to eat ice cream in this weather. Anyways, I went in and perused the options of flavors available. Here's the choices:It was interesting to see they had some unusual flavors like lychee, sesame, corn, and wasabi. I tried their green tea ice cream and it really didn't taste like green tea. I end up ordering a 2 scoop cup of sesame and chocolate fudge swirl...after pondering for nearly 5 minutes (or maybe it seems like an hour for the guy who's helping me out) what flavors I want to eat.It's a pretty generous portion for under $5. It looks small from these photos but it's probably 8 ounces of ice cream. The sesame is made of black sesame seeds but the flavor is a bit muted. There's not much nutty flavor in that black sesame ice cream. I guess they should've toasted the sesame beforehand. The texture reminds me of the tong sui version of a black sesame soup but just frozen and a bit creamier. The chocolate fudge swirl is the better out of the two flavors. The vanilla ice cream is creamy and it has enough vanilla flavor that it can cut through the chocolate fudge. I guess I like gelato a lot more since it's more creamier on the tongue (even though ice cream has more butterfat content than gelato, technically). I need to find more gelato shops in New York besides Otto and Il Laboratorio del Gelato! After eating that cup of ice cream, I went into food coma for a few moments and eventually dragged my shawarfel-ice cream stuffed self back to the streets, going uptown to get ready for class.Addresses:Tribeca Treats94 Reade StreetNew York, NYChickpeaVisited: 23 3rd AvenueNew York, NYSundaes & Cones95 East 10th StreetNew York, NYOoh!

You're so lucky with all that NYfood. Forget about negative thinking, just enjoy it :) Love that ice cream!

The negative thinking is over for me. I'm just taking everything in moderation.I liked the ice cream more than love.  I guess because I was disappointed with the sesame ice cream's lack of flavor.

A Day of (Sinful) Comfort Food

***CONTENT
For the past two days in New York City, it felt like the Arctic. Not like it's unusual of New York to be this cold but I just don't like to walk or get out of bed in this type of weather. Unfortunately, life doesn't work that way for me since I have classes. Pooh. At least classes start late for me today so I indulge myself into a bit of sinful, comfort foods. I should note that I'm not supposed to eat these items just because I have to go \"on a diet.\" I put those words in quotes just because it's only dieting for vanity, not really health reasons. (Even though sometimes I wonder I should watch what I eat since my blood sugar levels are above the norm: diabetes or my cholesterol and triglycerides are bad enough that I can no longer eat my beloved pastries...I hope none of those will be a problem.) My cousin's wedding is next week and I bought a dress and well, you know the rest... So I'm screwing my diet of rabbit food (i.e. salads without dressing and/or croûtons) and non-fat Fage yogurt, for the sake of my mind's wants due to my (and possibly your) Paleolithic ancestors for survival. How ironic. For breakfast, I ate at City Bakery. It's the start of the Hot Chocolate Festival! For those of you who are die hard fans of CB's hot chocolate go there before the month's over. Strangely, they didn't announce it when I was there on Feb. 1st. Here's the photos of the schedule (click on it to see it larger):Anywhoo, today's flavor is bourbon. I just ordered a shot (about 1/3 of the small; cost $2.50) instead of the usual small cup just because I was planning on eating something more fattening and caloric for lunch. Also, I had the pretzel croissant.Bourbon hot chocolate: still thick and creamyPretzel CroissantInnards!The bourbon hot chocolate is still rich, creamy, thick and decadently chocolatey. The only difference is the subtle background flavor of bourbon. No, there's no alcohol in this hot chocolate. All there is the bourbon flavor and it had a subtle bourbon alcohol aftertaste that lingers on the tongue for about 10 seconds. If you don't like bourbon or alcohol at all, just opt for the regular hot chocolate, it's still chocolate heaven to me. :)If you haven't read my lengthy post about NYC croissants, City Bakery's croissants generally are flaky, buttery, and crisp but it tends to be doughy. The reason I wanted the pretzel croissant is just because I needed something salty to cut through the sweetness of the hot chocolate. I'm very content with my breakfast. It's decadent, caloric and fattening but I enjoyed every moment of eating the delicious, salty, buttery croissant and the thick, rich chocolatey bourbon hot chocolate.On to lunch. For a long while since January, Stand burger has been opened for lunch. I have thought about going there to try out their burger just to find out if it's worth all the craze over burgers for the recent months in the city.Sorry; it's a bit blurred.I already knew what I wanted to order: their Lunch Pack. The only thing I changed was the beverage; I opted for the chocolate malt shake to replace their soda, so it'll cost me an extra $3 to make up for the difference in price of the soda to shake. So here's the shake:The second photo is meant to show you how thick that shake was. The darn thing is suspended in the straw and whenever I'm trying to drink it, I feel like I'm sucking my lungs out that my brain's about to explode from the lack of oxygen. That's how thick it was. Also, in case that shake isn't caloric and fattening enough, just top it with some whipped cream. Good God! That little glass probably have 2,000 calories! Those of you who aren't Americans that's the U.S.D.A.'s suggested average calorie intake (for an adult) for one day. At least these calories were delicious, creamy and obviously (much stressed) decadent; not something that I wasted on a bland, fattening food/drink. The shake had a nice chocolate flavor with a hint of malt. The reason I ordered chocolate malt was I wanted to have that old, nostalgic feel of drinking a malted shake and eating it with a burger and fries.Onto the food! The fries were pretty good. It's lightly salted, slightly crisp, and it had enough potato that well...it doesn't feel like you ate burnt, fried things that doesn't taste remotely potato. I know. I need a better description but it's the best I can do for the moment.The burger... From the first photo of this burger (it's the one above the fries), it's kind of funny. They want to indicate to you that you ordered a medium-rare burger by running a stake through it with a small sign saying, \"Medium-rare.\" I know, it's not that funny. Moving on...the burger is perfectly cooked to medium-rare with it's meaty juices absorbed by the brioche bun. It had a pretty strong, charred flavor that it's sort of complimented by a mustardy kick, and thinly sliced raw onions, and a touch of vinegary sweetness by the ketchup. I would say this burger is fine; not superb or mind-blowingly good. For the price I paid for, it's decent but I wouldn't come back for it if I had the choice. It's not really often that I would eat a burger anyways.So, this is my day of eating a lot of nutrient poor foods but at least I enjoyed it for today and I'll just run on the treadmill over the weekend and go back to my temporary habit of eating healthy.

Oo, I've wanted to check out Stand!  Even if it was fine, I still need to check it out for meself.  Meat.  Blob.  Pink.  Mmmm.  And that shake sounds might good (it's best when you feel like you're sucking your lungs, YEAAH?!).  Even if I could never burn it off.

Robyn: I think the shake's the best part of the entire meal. It's kind of unfortunate that it ended up that way but it was really good. I guess I'll just go there for the shakes or floats; not the food.

oh man, I'd totally trade my day of eating with yours! I had an in-n-out milkshake, thick, but not nearly as decadent as the one you feasted on. Can't believe I'm missing another year of the hot chocolate festival...sob, next year! :)

Oms/b Rice Balls & Le Pain Quotidien's Sandwich

This is basically two short reviews lumped into one. I guess it makes sense, since I don't want to mix two inexpensive places for something that is on the moderate price bracket (as in Otto, which will be the follow-up posting).The first one up is Oms/b. I ate there around 9:30 AM just because I didn't get the chance to eat breakfast. So this, in my case would be my breakfast and lunch, per se. I ordered their \"Breakfast Set\" which contains two rice balls, pickles and a cup of miso soup for the cost of $4.75. I picked the grilled salmon (photo below, on the left) and a salmon roe rice ball (on the right). (I happen to like salmon a lot.) They were made fresh, the woman who took my order made them in front of me. The pickles are the bright yellow chunks that you see in front of the rice balls. They aren't spherical shaped at all but they're still called \"balls.\" Anyways...Cup o' miso soupThe miso soup tasted ok. It wasn't as salty as many other places I've eaten that over-salted their soup. It had flecks of scallions (or green onions depending upon where you're from), a few small cubes of firm tofu and a few shreds of mushroom.The grilled salmon rice ball was chewy (from the nori, also known as seaweed, and the rice). The rice was sticky but more like sushi rice. It was salty since the description of this particular rice ball indicated that it's a salty fish. So, no surprise here. There was a good amount of salmon in there too, so it was satisfying to eat. The salmon roe rice ball was tasty as well. The roe gave it a buttery, creamy flavor and texture to the chewy rice and the slightly salty nori.It's not a bad place for a quick lunch since it took about a minute or less for them to make these rice balls and it's relatively inexpensive. There are other sets for lunch that have the option for more rice balls and a choice of an appetizer but still it can be made under $10.Next up, Le Pain Quotidien. I ate at the location nearest to my campus, located at 7th Avenue near 58th Street. I tried their brownie (really fudgey and delicious) and croissant before. So, it's not my first time here. I just chose to eat in here for once and try their sandwiches. I was seated in their communal table amongst the other diners there. There were other tables available, but I didn't really care where I sat.After perusing the menu for a good while, since I'm indecisive about what the heck I want to eat, I end up ordering a cup of cafe au lait (since many diners are ordering that; cost $2.95) and a chicken curry salad sandwich ($9.75).The sandwich platterThe sandwich platter was another 10 minutes wait. By the time it came to me, I was somewhat surprise to see the spread: a stone cheese board that serves as the platter, filled with my curry chicken salad open-faced sandwiches (or tartines, they call it), two slices of mango and cantaloupe and a mini mesclun salad and a chunk of tomato. The tiny bowl in the center is cranberry chutney. The sandwich s were delicious by itself but it tasted even better with the chutney. A small flaw was the bread. It was sliced a bit too thin to support the topping or the filling of the tartines that if one just picks it up by the edge, the toppings will fall off. The salad and fruit were nice accompaniment.I would eat here often but it is a bit too pricey to eat this everyday for lunch.Also, I went for a cup of City Bakery's hot chocolate ($4.50). I like their thick, ganache-like, creamy hot chocolate. Just to let you know, their annual Hot Chocolate Festival didn't start yet.Addresses:Oms/b156 East 45th Street (between Lexington & 3rd Ave.)New York, NYLe Pain Quotidien (various locations)Visited:922 7th AvenueNew York, NYCity Bakery3 West 18th StreetNew York, NY

The New Whole Foods...Whoa.

***CONTENT
Yesterday morning I went to Whole Foods. Not the one I frequent to in Columbus Circle, I'm talking about the one just opened yesterday on Bowery & Houston on the Lower East Side. Honestly, I think of it more like East of SoHo in my own geographic terms but it's supposed to be labeled the LES. Anyways, I know this opening since there's a lot of press coverage on it earlier this week from papers to blogs. So, why not visit there?First thing to note, this place is HUGE! The layout isn't so different from the other WFs; you are always greeted with their produce first but this time you have someone at the door asking if you would like to try their rolls. I just passed this offer since I've eaten their rolls and I find them decent or good, depending upon which one I have.Produce section; taken from the second floorSince it's early (for some; it was 8:10 AM), there aren't that many people in here. Mostly are a few local residents and people who heard about this place being opened yesterday, or the visiting press. The latter group of people was sort of the reason why I was able to sneak out my camera and start taking photos. Initially, no one stopped me until I went to the bakery and floral departments where they did tell me to stop. I felt kinda bad taking photos but I still don't exactly understand why it's not allowed.As I strolled through the entire store, it's easy to get a little lost in finding your stuff since the size reminds me of being in a suburban supermarket or something similar to the size of Fairway but a ton cleaner.The cheese department is bigger than any other WF store I've been to (and I've been to all three: Chelsea, Union Square, and Columbus Circle) but I still prefer Fairway's cheese department more since the prices are better and the people who work behind the counter know their cheese well. The strange elements WF adds to their cheese department was the \"shower\" (and a small \"cooler\"; I didn't photograph that) which is more like a miniature version of an indoor fountain. The sign that you will see below, reads: \"A steady flow of water adds humidity to the room.\" Odd.The confections department is a lot bigger and the choices of chocolates and some Middle Eastern desserts are more available to the masses. I didn't care much for the meat and fish department just because I don't by either of those from WF. As for prepared foods, the salad/food bar is a bit larger, you have a pommes frites station, and chili too.Interesting chocolate flavor...Robyn's Chocolates...?More sugary goodness!Pommes Frites!At the end of my own tour of this ginormous place, I ended up buying a cup of gelato. I even admit that I'm eating this at 9 AM. I asked where their seating area is located and they said that it would be upstairs. When I got up there, the seating area could fit in an army! It had two sit-in bars that serves you food like sushi in Columbus Circle but bigger and an Italian food area as well. I just wanted to sit in a well lit area and I ended up getting a seat where the sun was beaming through the windows.Sushi BarSeating areaCouches near my tableI don't care since it's available to me and I'm not planning to come here very often. Since I don't go to the Lower East Side that often even though I should. Anyways, here's the gelato.Close upThe visible scoop is fig gelato; the one that is peeking and melting a little is hazelnut chocolate, and underneath that is Thai chili chocolate. I know the flavor combinations are strange but it sort of work. The hazelnut chocolate is the bridge between the two; fig works well with chocolate and hazelnut and the chocolate matches the chocolate in the Thai chili. The chili though was quite a spicy one since the chili doesn't burn on your tongue; it burns the back of your throat.So that's my two cents on the new Whole Foods. I would just come here for the interesting confection choices and the gelato. The flavor choice of gelatos in Union Square is severely limited.If you want to see photos about this place, please click here.Address: 95 East Houston Street (between Bowery and Christie Streets) New York, NY

Generally, no photos are allowed indoors because it's \"private property.\"  In the case of retail, the owner don't want competitors to look at pictures.  If you speak to a manager beforehand and explain that you're a food blogger who loves their stuff (and not trying to sell trade secrets), they'll probably oblige.

awww man, I could totally go for some pomme frites now, you'll have to report back if you try it! :)
I like wandering around Whole Foods just to look, though I hardly shop there - some of their items are way out of my budget. I agree that Fairway is more affordable and perhaps even customer friendly market! and the cheese there! oh my, the cheeeeeses :)

Getting my hands on some of their pommes frites would probably a few weeks 'til I actually visit down there. I don't usually hang out around this area.YES! Fairway has awesome cheeses! I think I should visit there soooon... I don't know about Fairway being more customer friendlier than WF but it is cheaper.

I would much prefer going to the original storefronts of Il Laboratorio and Pommes Frites, though.

Thanks for displaying my chocolate. My business is predominantly wholesale but I do have a website where I take orders, robynschocolate.com.

I know those of you who have been reading my blog for a while are probably getting weary of me due to the fact that every week I'm bound to write something about Bouchon. Well, at least it's all about desserts. Yeess...the sugary goodness that Bouchon actually excel in most parts (the exclusion is the disappointing French macarons). Since this is about their seasonal stuff, let's start cracking.With Easter and Passover coming in less than two weeks, Bouchon has created seasonal menus for both holidays, if you seen their menus near the registers recently, you know what I'm talking about. Yesterday (Monday), I had their Hot Cross Bun (for Easter) and a Flourless Chocolate Cake (that's for the Passover menu).Hot Cross BunFlourless Chocolate CakeThe hot cross bun was excellent. The bun had a rich buttery flavor with a hint of nutmeg, cardamom, and orange flower water. It's just sweet, moist, chewy, and chock full of dried fruits such as raisins, cranberries, and currants. This is one of the best hot cross buns I ever had but for a price tag of $4.95, it's going to prohibit me from having this often. Here's a few more photos of the hot cross bun for you...Top viewSide viewTorn/Innards!The flourless chocolate cake was fine. It's not bad or sublime; it's just the fact that it didn't blow me away.Cutting into the cakeSlice of cake popping outTexture shot of sliceThe chocolate cake was dense, moist, not exactly fudgey as I've asked and been told. It was just sweet, and it was dusted with a snowy storm of powdered sugar, decorated with a raspberry ganache quenelle, a halved fresh raspberry, and a sprinkling of raspberry flavored sugar (hence the red spots on the cake). I don't really like the pairing of raspberry and chocolate. It is probably that is why I don't like this cake too much also the fact I want the fudgey texture or something similar to their chocolate bouchon but I didn't find that in this cake. Oh well...I least I know now.Then on Tuesday, I had their Pistachio and Cherry Brioche ($3.25) and a Tropical Millefeuille ($7.25). Pistachio & Cherry BriocheTropical MillefeuilleThe brioche was really tasty. It was buttery, slightly sweet, and moist. It contained a ton of dried, sweet bing cherries with chopped pistachio bits floating around the bread, and it had some orange peel to make it tantalizingly interesting. Yums. Here's more food porn...Cut Brioche...Innards!And lastly, the Tropical Millefeuille. It was delicious but the puff pastry was a bit soggy due to refrigeration.Click on the photo to indicate the layers.That's about it...I'm not willing to eat anymore desserts before I'm really asking for death within a couple of years. Hopefully, this will guide you to a more fruitful ending to your day or meal at Bouchon Bakery. That's if you're going to visit there within the week or so. The millefeuille is a standard pastry though.

I don't like raspberry + chocolate either!  HIGH FIIIIVE!...um...I also don't really like millefeille, not that it makes me recoil in horror, but I'd rather eat...like...most other things.Man, you eat everything at Bouchon.  ;)

2007-04-02 10:56:00
Robyn: Um, \"yay!\" and *high five back at you* for not liking raspberry and chocolate...?Millefeille is tasty stuff but if it isn't prepared that well or it isn't fresh enough then it would make sense not to like it.It's unfortunately true that I ate almost everything (practically 90% of their stuff) at Bouchon but I feel I should stay away from them and find other gems near my campus.

I'm not writing an official food post today, just because I'm (supposed to) writing a ten page paper but only up to page three. Woohooo... Enough with my crappy, soul-sucking, academic life, here's a bit of random announcements that are food related that you may want to know about or participate in.Those of you who like to participate in voting and write mini-reviews your favorite eating establishments in New York City, go to Zagat and after you're done voting you get a FREE copy of the 2008 New York City Restaurants guide! Start voting now to May 18th. (Thanks for the e-mail reminder, Michael, who writes the Big Apple Dining Guide).Bouchon Bakery had started their Passover/Easter menu that is available only for a limited time. Some things that are \"seasonal\" are the matzoh quiche ($7.95), chocolate babka ($18), a large chocolate-dipped coconut macaroon ($4), large, adorable Easter bunny cookies ($3), and some Easter themed chocolates ($6-$38). I'm working on their some of their seasonal confections/desserts/pastries, so be patient with my food review that will come in a couple of days that post will be loaded with sugary goodness and fat.One last announcement pertaining to the macaron hunt on Sunday with Robyn and I...and everyone else who's coming. I went to La Maison du Chocolat recently because I caved in for their cute yet sophisticated Easter chocolates (I'm saving macarons on macaron day. I'm not that mean). Here's the photos of the announcement...Front side Just click on the photo for a larger version.

But thanks for thinking by reviews are excellent. :)I'm almost done with that paper now...I just need to work on another research paper. Oh joy.

Today is too gorgeous to not eat out in an open space. It's 72 degrees Fahrenheit, warm, and sunny...so why not? Since I have no clue what restaurants actually has good food and a nice outdoor seating, I went back to Shake Shack. I know I went here last week but I changed my order a bit to expand my horizons on their menu.When I got here at 11:05 A.M., there's already a line formed unlike last week. The line is actually about halfway to the end of the block on Madison Avenue and 28th Street. It's not terrible but I had to wait about 15 minutes 'til I got to order. I ended up choosing a Chicago dog ($3.25), a regular sized Arnold Palmer ($2.00), and a double dip chocolate custard ($3.25). Just to let you know what's an Arnold Palmer, it's basically iced tea mixed with lemonade. I don't really know why I ordered it and it doesn't go with a hot dog, but I did.I did receive their ShackWand as you have seen from my last post. But this time my order took a shorter time than I have expected. I got my order in about 10 minutes. Here's my food.My orderThe Arnold Palmer and Chicago DogChocolate Custard and the Chicago DogI ate the chocolate custard first since it looks about to melt to a chocolate custard soup, which is not what I want to eat.Creamy chocolate goopIt actually tasted pretty good. It's smooth, creamy, a bit dense, and it's not too sweet. I just wished that the custard was not so melted. Eh, that's the major problem whenever it's too warm for any frozen treat.The Chicago dog was interesting and different.Chicago Dog with ketchupChomped dog...The hot dog is made from all beef. It tasted great but I'm just not too fond of the condiments used on this hot dog. It's just too much stuff on top. I liked the relish and mustard but the hot peppers, sliced red bell pepper strips, onions, and cucumbers was a little too over the top for me. The poppy seed hot dog bun was good though.As I eat my lunch, I kept note of how crazy the line keeps getting longer and longer to the point that if you were to take your lunch hour here you've wasted it, leaving empty handed (and an empty stomach). Here's a couple of photos to explain what I mean.The line at 11:50 A.M.The line at 12:05 P.M.The end of the line at 12:05 P.M. That's if I was there but thankfully, I don't.The scene at 11:50 A.M. already astounded me when the line is already reaching the subway station at the corner of Broadway and 23rd Street. But once you hit at five after twelve, forget about eating here! I would find another place to eat, unless I had nothing better to do than wait for another two hours for a darn burger and shake. Trust me, I don't have that kind of patience and stamina to wait that long.

holy cow, that line is crazy! I can't understand how anyone would have patience to stand in such a line...man, i bet you could go all the way uptown, have lunch at bouchon, and get back, in less time than it would take to go through that line!

new york looks so pretty in the spring, sigh...almost fall, and then i'll be back again! i hope we can meet up for fooooodings :)

Kathy: I know! I should have wrote that Shake Shack should do phone orders and/or delivery to local offices since the majority of the people on line are local businessmen and women who work from the financial buildings in the Flatiron District.I can hope we can meet up for foodings. I'm still going to be here for the fall...

This is a bit of a backtrack post since I wanted to write about my first Shake Shack experience. So, I'll start from Monday evening, when Robyn got me some macarons, as you have probably seen or read from this post, and some chocolate bonbons from her Parisian vacation last week. Since I've ingested my macarons first, I wanted to try Pierre Herme's chocolates. Why not? I love his macarons, I'm expecting no less of standards after eating the maccies.So, here's the chocolates...Side view of boxChocs protected with a plastic coverChocolates platedThey look as good as they taste. Uh huh! It's about the equivalent to La Maison du Chocolat's standards. The use of great chocolate, with a somewhat innovative ganaches (e.g. praline, caramel, passion fruit, etc.) that is within a balanced ratio of chocolate to filling. Not too sweet, not at all bland, and good, smooth mouth-feel for each and every bite. It's lovely. If you want to know what flavors I've gotten and eaten, click here.On Tuesday, I went to Bouchon Bakery. Probably a suitable subtitle for this blog would be the \"Bouchon Bakery Eater.\" Oy. You know why I eat here often, so I won't explain it again. I end up having a Ham & Cheese Baguette ($7.75) and a Lemon Tart ($6.75).The baguette with Cornichon picklesLemon TartThe baguette was ok. The roast beef sandwich I had fared much better than this ham and cheese baguette. I think the ham was cooked or warmed too long that it dried up too well and the cheese doesn't have that gooey, creaminess that I desired. I'm a bit disappointed but the baguette was good though.The lemon tart was fine.InnardsThe crust was good. It's a pâte brisée dough with chunks of almonds embedded in the crust. The lemon tart filing was a bit too soft or loose that it didn't have much structure that whenever I'm trying to fork a bite to my mouth, it falls apart. I don't know why but probably after my dismal experience with the macarons I had when I ate with Robyn, Bouchon's quality is falling... I truly hope not before Thomas Keller will actually mar is reputation as a world class chef.The Macaron Meet Up with Robyn and Me! Hey everyone! On Sunday, April 1st (yes, it's April Fools' Day), we're meeting up in hopes to find awesome French macarons (not those coconut cookies) in New York City. I'm talking about these wonderful cookies...If you can join us, please leave a comment on this post or write a comment on Robyn's forum. We'll give you details in the very near future. I should note that we are NOT going to Bouchon Bakery since we're disappointed (as noted from my earlier post) and Tisserie (since Robyn didn't like it so much and I don't really like Tisserie since they charge outrageous prices for decent food). Hope to see you soon!

Ugh. Disappointing to read the H&C baguette was a no-go. It looked so good on your Flickr, which is what shot me over here. The only thing bad I've had from Bouchon so far has been the Buche de Noël -- and can you really ever expect a Buche de Noël to be good?
thewanderingeater
2007-03-27 01:54:00
Adam: I guess the disappointment for the H&C was due to the fact that whoever heated my sandwich heated for too long? I'm not too sure. Anyways, I never had a decent Buche de Noël before (not from Bouchon). I tried it once but it didn't blow me away.

I think I'm one of the last few food bloggers and New Yorkers who ate here at Shake Shack for the first time (it's shameful, I know). It always made me wonder what's all the hoopla's about whenever this place open every single year and now, I know what it's all about.It's about 11:35 AM when I arrived to Shake Shack and I'm starving. Thankfully there was no line, since it's a bit chilly and it's cloudy out. Only a local businesswoman ahead of me, not that legendary line that forces one to wait for hours on end to get a darn burger. Anyways, when it's my turn to order, I wanted a Shackburger ($4.75), a Black & White Milkshake ($5.75), and an order of fries ($2.50). After I paid they gave me this new innovation of sorts, which is their ShackWand. The ShackWand is your notification system that your food is ready and waiting at the window; it's shaped like a remote and it rings like a cell phone in vibrate mode. Take a look...The back of the ShackWandOut of boredom, I flipped to the backside of the ShackWand and saw the above photo's label. I thought it was funny, well, not really. The line is starting to build up, too...Go ahead and stare at me, the man with the trench coat...Taking care of the lunch crowdAbout 10 minutes passed when I actually felt my ShackWand buzzing and heard my name to be called out that my order's ready. Here's the goods...The B&W shake is on the back left of the photoLook at the lovely, crisp French friesI honestly have to say those fries, as you see above, is probably the best part of the entire meal. It's perfectly crisp, warm, and it had just enough salt that it's not too salty nor too bland. Yums.The Shackburger!Chomped thrice (meaning 3 times)!The Shackburger is probably the best burger I've tasted so far in the city. It had a good ratio of meat to bun, the veggies were fresh, and it was tasty. I just wished they would cook it medium-rare instead of medium-well.The Black & White shake was ok.It's not as thick as Stand's shake, which is what I really liked from there. It also lacked flavor. Not to say that it's bland but no real flavors stuck out that indicate there was a chocolate ice cream (or custard they use here) and vanilla. It's just...eh, and high in calories, say 1,000 for that cup. Probably, I'll just order their custard separately and have water on the side.Before I left Madison Square Park (it's about 12 PM), the line is insanely long!Part 1...Part 2...Finally, the end of the line.I think it stayed this long around 1 PM, when I passed through the park as I walked uptown. Thankfully, I beat the crowds...So there you have it, my first experience at Shake Shack is actually good but not mind-blowing greatness. I need to find and try more burger places. I know there's the Burger Joint on 57th Street, amongst a TON of other places, any suggestions are welcome.Address: Shake Shack Madison Square Park at Madison Ave near 23rd & 24th Street New York, NY

Today was a bit unusual for me to go fooding with someone since it's a Monday. That someone was Robyn. She e-mailed me over on Sunday regarding to a favor that I've asked for when she went to her food and fun excursion to Paris for her Spring Break (Lucky girl), which is getting me some Pierre Herme's stuff! I'm getting a little ahead of myself. I'll just start from the beginning...We've exchanged e-mails wondering where the heck do we eat, meet, and get my PH goodies; eventually we agreed on Korean food at NY Kom Tang Soot Bul Kai Bi. We've met during lunchtime (around 12:40 PM) and proceeded to enter the restaurant. It looked somewhat empty and when we asked for seating, the employees pointed upstairs. When we got up and asked for a table for two, we were seated near the windows for a table for six. How odd.We perused the menu and Robyn decided on ordering a pork stone bowl ($8.95) and I ordered a beef bento box from the lunch special ($8.95).After waiting a couple of minutes, the waitress gave our banchan, which means Korean appetizers.Group (food) photo!WatercressKorean style potato saladDried fishKimchiJapchaeIt's quite a generous offering: small plates of kimchee, a Korean style potato salad, cooked, cold watercress, pickled vegetables, and the dried fish. They're pretty good. Robyn really likes the watercress. I'm just not too fond of that mayonnaise vegetable salad.The tea served was pretty good, it's the rice cracker type of tea. Robyn liked it a lot since it had a sweet background with that nutty, rice cracker flavor. The miso soup is also served; I still think their soup is still a bit too salty but it's a bit more palatable.Blurry miso soup...The food... Well, Robyn's stone bowl came out hot and sizzling with all the lovely ingredients that is anticipating to be mixed by her. Since Robyn loves spicy food, she poured on the hot sauce as she mixes her food.Robyn's Gobdol BimibapRobyn mixing her bimibap and squeezing a ton of sauce.Mixed bimibapI tasted a bite of her food and it's pretty good. It's healthy but tasty stuff: bean sprouts, mushrooms, and other vegetables and a bit of pork. Yums.Blurry food...My kalbi beef bento box was HUGE. It's a generous amount of food considering the fact that it's $8.95. Oy...the beef was well, beefy and tender. The California roll is not so great. I've had better. The other things that were in my bento were good but nothing much to speak about except the fact that it's a lot of grub.My Kalbi (Beef) Bento BoxOrange slices served when given the checkWhen we finished our lunch, Robyn and I are groaning that we're full but we're thinking about dessert. Since she has brought me some Pierre Herme's chocolates and macarons from Paris, I wanted to compare macarons from Bouchon Bakery as well. The argument that Robyn made is that you're comparing two entirely different things; it's like comparing an apple to an orange. But still, I wanted to do it and I dragged Robyn along.Since it's about 1:40, Bouchon is packed with the lunch crowd. But we're motivated to stay and do a comparison of macarons and nosh some other stuff from Bouchon. What captivated me to eat was the Key Lime Cheese Danish, a Meyer Lemon macaron, and a Coconut macaron. Robyn ordered a Pain aux Raisin, a Meyer Lemon macaron, and a Vanilla macaron (even though she thought she ordered a hazelnut). Here's the goods...My DanishRobyn's Pain aux RaisinsRobyn's MacciesMy danish was interesting. It's uber flaky (I wish more croissants were this flaky), the cream cheese portion was tasty but too little of it was in there; my favorite part was the sweet, key lime flavored graham cracker cubes but it's not something I would eat again since I wanted more filling.Danish; split in halfRobyn's pain aux raisin was really buttery that its flavor dominated my palate. The pastry was really moist, obviously due to the high butterfat content, and it had a good amount of raisins in every bite. It's really tasty.Pain aux Raisins' innardsNow, the macarons. Bouchon's Meyer lemon macaron was too chewy and it had a more dominant almond flavor instead of the lemon. Robyn's vanilla macaron was decent. It's not as chewy but the ratio of filling to cookie is too little. My coconut macaron had a nice coconut texture from the coconut flakes in the cookie, a bit chewy but it's still not mind blowing.Robyn's Macaron innardsMy Macarons' innardsThe box of macarons (from Pierre Herme)! Where's the beaming light from the heavens when you needed one?Appropriately named \"Fetish\" macarons. It's becoming mine...It's love, man. All love...After eating all of that stuff as well as lunch, I'm really stuffed but I wanted to compare PH's macarons to Bouchon. I just picked one randomly and Robyn told me I have the Pistache Griottine.Oh, the anticipation of greatness...The physical differences between PH's and Bouchon's is that PH's is a lot more heavier in weight, a five times the amount of filing than Bouchon, and the diameter is a bit smaller.Pistache Griottine macaron innardsWhen I put the first half of PH's macaron in my mouth, all I said was, \"Oh my god.\" Robyn asked, \"Is it good?\" I just replied that, \"It's too good that I'm speechless.\" I felt tears of joy welling up in my eyes from the taste and texture of that macaron. It's so damn good! It's like eating a macaron created by the macaron god (refering to Pierre Herme). Now Thomas Keller's (the owner of Bouchon Bakery) macaron is just a petty, ignorant mortal's macaron. It's just awful after eating Pierre Herme's macaron. I really want to start a petition and an e-mailing campaign to Mr. Keller to make a macaron similar to Pierre Herme (more filling and less chewy cookies), and/or write to Pierre Herme to open a branch in New York City! We must get better macarons! New Yorkers is known to be a tough crowd for food, so why not demand for better macarons?! Not pitiful cookies that tastes like crap.For contact info to Pierre Hermes, click here (please note that it's in French), as for Thomas Keller, click here. I mean it! Write an e-mail protesting the dismal state of macarons in New York (even in the United States) and demand for better macarons! I'm even doing it now.About the rest of the macarons' life, it didn't last too long since I ate it all last night. Yep. They're too delicious to not eat. If you want to know the rest of the flavors I've gotten from Robyn, click here; for the innards shot, click here. I honestly believe that was the best $25 I've ever spent on food (it also include a small box of chocolates too).Addresses:NY Kom Tang Soot Bul Kai Bi 32 W 32nd Street New York, NYBouchon Bakery 10 Columbus Circle, 3rd Floor New York, NY

Thee rice cracker type of tea you mentioned must be \"hyunmi cha\" mad from brown rice.  Sometimes it is mixed with green tea to make\"hyunmi nokcha\".I didn't realize Robyn ate Korean food since I have never come across any photos of Korean food on her website! ;-)

I'll do this post in chronological order. Back on Tuesday, I went to Bouchon Bakery for dessert. I think this shouldn't surprise you anymore to the fact that I'm getting a bit monotonous with this place but...I can't help it. Their stuff is too tasty and pretty not talk about. Anyways, I had their \"Le Mont Blanc\" ($7.75) and a cup of coffee.Split in half...Zoomed in detail of sliced halfInnardsThose of you who don't know what is a mont blanc is, it's basically a classic dessert of sweetened, pureed chestnuts subtly flavored with vanilla. The mixture is riced and mounded into a high, fluffy mountain on a platter. This sweet alp is capped with whipped cream or crème chantilly. Mont Blanc (\"white mountain\") is a peak in the French Alps near the Italian border (cited from The New Food Lover's Companion).This is a more sophisticated version than what the description indicated. This is a dessert set in a barely sweetened chocolate sucree, layered with vanilla buttercream (that's the white dots on the base), a hemisphere of chestnut mousse, drizzled with a sweet, caramel-ly milk chocolate, mounded with chestnut buttercream, topped with a candied chestnut and an edible gold leaf to make it more luxurious. Yep, it tastes as good as it looks and sounds from what you're reading. It's not at all cloyingly sweet, it's just sweet enough to soothe the sweet tooth.On late Thursday morning around 11:30, I was dying from the humidity from this ethereal spring-like weather in New York City (since today and Saturday is snowing). Usually whenever I feel hot I would want two things: an ice cold drink (non-alcoholic, I'm referring) and ice cream or gelato. Since I was in Whole Foods and I didn't really want to eat a whole pint of ice cream by myself in one sitting, I just went upstairs and have some gelato. Whole Foods recently have a small section where you could have some of il laboratorio del gelato's gelato. I opted for a medium cup containing a scoop of ricotta gelato, dark chocolate gelato, and blackberry sorbet.I know the photo above has the chocolate all melted. I can't really do much with that since it's on the bottom and I took a bit of time eating my way down before I hit the chocolate portion. Anyways, all three flavors blend nicely. You have the creamy tang from the ricotta (which is a soft cheese for those of you who don't know), rich dark chocolate, and the sharp, fruity flavor of the blackberry. My small complaint is that the ricotta and blackberry were too icy. I guess Whole Foods set their freezer temperature too low. It's good but it's too small to justify that it costs me $4.50 for the portion they have given me. I guess it could be worse...I wasn't so interested in eating other places around Union Square and the East Village Ice Cream shop that opened the past week was not opened yet when I stopped by there. So, I just went back uptown and had a real lunch at Bouchon Bakery. I know, I know. I'm getting redundant with Bouchon. I promise it'll be the last mentioning of that name for a while and I will be motivated to eat somewhere else.Since it was lunch hour (it's 1 PM), the lines are starting form around the bakery side of Bouchon. I ended up ordering a Roast Beef sandwich ($9.25) and a Nutter Butter Cookie ($2.75). I requested it to be warmed just because it would be horrible to eat a sandwich that has been sitting in the fridge for a few hours; it would result in consuming soggy bread and no contrast of textures and textures since everything is cold. The wait was 5 minutes since ordering.Roast Beef Sandwich served with a side of Cornichon PicklesThe Nutter Butter CookieNutter Butter, in halfThe roast beef sandwich was awesome! It was worth the wait since the bread is now crisp and warm, the Fontina cheese is warm, gooey, melted and the beef was tasty. The sandwich had a good proportion of bread and filling. Yums.The Nutter Butter cookie is one of my favorite cookies here. It is a nostalgic (but gourmetized) reminder of childhood since my parents used to buy me a few packages of Nutter Butter sandwich cookies. I had and still love peanut butter but only the natural stuff since the manufactured ones have a weird gummy texture. Anyways, the cookies are soft and chewy with the visible chunks of peanuts gives it a nice touch. The peanut butter filling is whipped that it feels light and airy on the tongue even though it's a calorie bomb.Eh, indulgence is the key here. I'm having a rough week with school...too much work. Food is my therapy. Albeit, possibly an unhealthy one for me if I keep eating like this. No, I don't eat like this at home; it's much healthier and uninteresting than anything I post up.Have a good weekend!

Hey Tina!
I swear that has to be the prettiest Mont Blanc I've ever seen. mmm, chestnut based desserts are soooo...sigh, sublime! If you're ever in the neighborhood, Claude's on West 4th sells these amazing meringues. If you ask, he'll take it back in the kichen and sort of reconstruct it, spinning threads of cheastnut puree and cream whipped thick with just a touch of sugar. that and a cup of coffee, and I'd be just about the happiest person in the world! :)And don't stop going to Bouchon! You've become the all inclusive Bouchon on their pastries...and now you're moving into the sandwich field. Conquer them all! hehe. no really. that would be so awesome if you had one of every single one of their pastries! :)

2007-03-17 01:23:00
Hey Kathy,
All of Bouchon's stuff are pretty, exquisite looking and tasting...so far. I think I pretty much covered their most of their basic pastries. I just need to try their exclusive weekend stuff (e.g. donuts and Marguerite), and a few more tarts. Then I need to move onto half of the viennosseries that I haven't tried. Eeek...just writing this out is scaring me how much I'm going to eat.Ooh...the Claude's suggestion sounds wonderful! :)
Man, I'm imaging how Claude would make that magnificent dessert from that tiny kitchen of his... *sighs* I need to go there soon!

Oh man, that mont blanc looks heavenly.  The last time I had mont blanc was in Paris and it was SO SWEEEET, I think I felt sick afterwards (couldn't finish it either).  I need to get myself to Bouchon Bakery!
thewanderingeater
2007-03-20 00:49:00
That mont blanc was GOOOD! I'm sorry that Parisian patisseries and bakeries disappointed you for that dessert...or you should have went to a different one. I dunno...I just thought it was odd that you haven't gotten the mont blanc when we went there today.

Eleven Madison Park Restaurant: The Gourmand Menu

***CONTENT
For the sake of being curious, I wanted to try Eleven Madison Park's tasting menu for lunch. Why? Well, I still have their Restaurant Week certificate (which worth $24.07). It would be interesting to let Chef Daniel Humm strut his stuff for lunch, instead of me picking out what I think tastes good.The only thing differed from my tasting from the menu was the Lobster Cappuccino due to the fact that I'm allergic to shellfish. Here's the menu (read the second page).As always first, the bread and butter.I'm still amused how they serve the butterButter dish, uncoveredMy French Baguette/RollThis time, I just chose the French baguette. I'm not feeling for olive or multi-grain bread. The bread was good. A thin, crisp, crust with a chewy, irregular crumb. The butter is fine. I just kind of miss how they had the maple leaf shaped butter. Now, it's a bit unappealing to see that they cut the butter with a serrated knife that isn't even cut straight.The appetizer:The name of this dish is \"Foie Gras torchon with Venezuelan Cocoa and Quince.\" It looks pretty, doesn't it? Obviously, the foie gras torchon is decadent and rich. The cocoa that is marbled in the foie is very subtle. It contrasts the richness of the liver with sharp, bitter tones of the unsweetened cocoa. The quince jelly that the foie gras is resting on top of, is another component to cut through the fatty richness; leaving behind a nice, slightly tart flavor on the palate. Just to note, there's also a slice of rich, eggy, buttery broiche that is lightly toasted and marbled with unsweetened cocoa to accompany this dish. It provides an added richness but also it gives it a textural contrast from the smooth and creamy to the flaky, crispness of the broiche toast.First course: Mediterranean Loup de Mer with Slow Cooked with Saffron Endive NageThis is a rich yet light fish course. Loup de mer is sea bass, that is poached in endive, saffron, vegetable broth (that's nage). The nage has a lovely spectrum of flavors ranging from bitter to sweet from the assortment of vegetables, like the endive and the use of saffron in that broth. Obviously, there is some use of butter to make it richer. The loup de mer is cooked perfectly. It's sweet and mild tasting, yet it took in some of the flavors from the nage. The vegetable quenelle that sits on top of the fish also imparted some sharpness to contrast the richness of this dish.Second course: Prawn Cappuccino in VeloutéPresentedSpoonedThe name is somewhat incomplete since the person who served this to me mumbled the name and description of this dish. This is supposed to replace my Lobster Cappuccino, as I have mentioned earlier. All I can taste was pretty much a velouté (a cream soup) of leeks, potatoes, possibly quince, and celeraic. The prawns provided a sweet contrast the velouté soup. It was perfectly cooked. The soup was interesting but I don't really see point of the cappuccino part, which is the foam. I think it's for vanity; it didn't really do much in terms of texture.Third course: Four Story Hill Poularde Poached with Black Truffles and Butternut Squash Presented viewAngled viewUnveiling of the black truffleThis dish is one of the most expensive served during lunch, if it was to be ordered a la carte it would cost you $34. I guess it would make sense since Four Story Hill is a local New York purveyor of milk-fed chickens like it was raised in Bresse, France. They're pampered, happy little birds until it's time for them to be sold and eaten. The black truffle is on the generous side, since it practically covered the entire surface of the chicken breast meat. The taste was hearty and earthy due to the nature of the taste of the black truffle and the brown sauce that is drizzled on the meat. The chicken was tender and juicy; well cooked. Once again, that potato foam on top of the chicken served no practical purpose to the dish, unless one would argue that the light texture of the foam contrasted to the heaviness of this dish. But I don't see the point of foam. The orange dots are butternut squash mousseline; the white is potato mousseline, and the ones with parsley leaves on top are parsnip mousseline. Out of those three I liked the sweetness of the butternut squash and the crunchy bitterness of the parsnip.The last course: Fourme d’Ambert with Pear-Vanilla Mousseline, Port Wine Reduction and Caramelized PecanPresented viewZoomed viewServed with a slice of toasted pecan raisin breadI opted for a cheese course this time, since the superb pastry chef, Nicole Kaplan left last Thanksgiving. The dessert department has not reached the same (tasting) heights as Mr. Humm's dishes, as I have tasted last time during Restaurant Week in February.The Fourme d’Ambert is a dense, pungent, creamy, nutty, blue cheese. The accompaniments with the blue cheese on that plate, paired very well: it brought out the sweet contrasts and accompanied the nutty character in the cheese. The toast also played the same role, but also brought in a crunchy, chewy texture to the game. It's lovely.By the time I finished the cheese course, the sommelier and possibly one of the managers of the restaurant came to my table and inquired me how I thought of my lunch. I simply replied, \"It was interesting...but good.\" He seemed somewhat satisfied with that answer. I asked about the prix fixe menu that they used to offer but he said that they wanted to step away from that and go toward a real tasting menu. Those of you who followed this restaurant for a while and wondered what the heck happened to that menu, there's your answer.Even though it's a side comment, I think he visited my table just because I was taking photos of my food and scribbling away notes as I'm eating. I think that they think I'm a food critic/writer for a magazine. How humorous and flattering...For all the photos in a somewhat slideshow format, please click here.

Oh my gaaawwdd AHGRAHGR TASTIES EVERYWHERE (sobs)I'd love a bite of that foie gras.  Or two.  Or five.  It looks beaauutiful....along with all the other food.  For some reason Eleven Madison Park is the only upscale restaurant that I'm really interested in trying.  ...Or any place with a dessert tasting menu.

It was tasty alright...You should definitely go to Eleven Madison Park! Everything's gorgeous from the decor down to the FOOD! The only thing that would disappoint you is the dessert. Since the former head pastry chef, Nicole Kaplan left, the dessert does not match the Exec. Chef Daniel Humm's food. Also, they don't have a dessert tasting menu.

Today, I actually ate barbecue for breakfast and lunch. The crazy thing about that statement is that I ate this in Madison Square Park with all of these people!It's insane how long the lines are, and how eager people are to get things for free. Come to think about it, who would actually pass up the chance of eating barbecued meats and be graced by the presence of Chris Lilly, one of the country’s best known pit masters, Rick Rodgers, and chef Aaron Sanchez? Chris Lily injecting marinade into pork buttAaron Sanchez talking on an interviewI just wished I could have stayed there until 5 PM, when Mr. Lily would unveil his \"7-Time World Championship Pulled Pork\"... Eh, unfortunately I'm worn out by classes and I don't want to linger in the city any longer. Not to mention the fact that there will be hordes of nearby office workers packing the lines since I've seen quite a bit throughout the morning. Just to let you know, this is an event is called \"Spring Forward, Get Grilling,\" sponsored by Kingsford® Charcoal for the advent of the earlier daylight savings time. Also Kingsford, Glad, and other companies is sponsoring a program called \"Family Day\" to encourage families to eat together more frequently, so children will less likely to smoke, drink, or use drugs (it's been researched from Columbia University's The National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse; a.k.a. CASA). I know the latter was pretty much a public service announcement and not really food related but it's for a good cause. You should support this program! You don't want the future generation be wasted by drugs and alcohol.Moving on to the food. The first thing I ate (around 9:40 AM) there was a version of a barbecue breakfast burrito, if you will.It's basically a lightly warmed tortilla from the grill, topped with scrambled eggs, green peppers and onions, and smoked pork tenderloin. Not bad. I think the pork was a little dry but it's pretty darn tasty.Next up (around 10:30 AM), Rick Rodgers' \"Vietnamese Beef Salad with Eye Round.\"The slaw was a bit spicy, sweet and salty, with a nice crunch from the shredded cabbage. The eye round was good. It's very juicy, as you'll see on the photo below, pay attention to the cutting board.Then, I had Aaron Sanchez's \"Lamb Anticuchos with Almond Mojo.\"I have to admit, this is one of the best things I've eaten here. The lamb is extremely tender, sweet and savory at the same time, and the nuts in that marinade gave it some texture. I love it.Last but not at all least, Chris Lily's \"Orange Pineapple Sweet Ribs.\"This rib kicks some major butt. I have to say, this is one of the best ribs I've ever tasted my entire life (besides my dad's version). The baby back rib meat just melts in your mouth. It's succulent, sweet, slightly smoky; good god, you just have to taste it for yourself to know what I'm talking about (meaning you should have gone there or travel to Chris Lily's restaurant in Alabama). It's mind blowingly great.Speaking on the topic of Madison Square Park, the opening of Shake Shack is coming!It'll be another 8 days and counting... Those of you who miss their burgers, hot dogs, custards and/or concretes, think positively while you will wait two hours for your order on opening day. I will pity you. I will not be able to join you crazy people since I will have class by then. I'm planning to be there on the second day of opening...After having enough 'cue and smoke for the past 3 hours, I left the park with the scent of grilled meat and burnt charcoal. No, seriously. I smelled like barbecue from my clothes and probably a hint of it in my hair. As much as I like to eat it, I don't want to smell like it. Anyways, I wanted dessert and since I have classes soon, I went uptown to Bouchon Bakery. Yeah, I can never get enough of this place. I ended up ordering a Caramel Peanut Banana Mousse ($7.25) and a small coffee.The mousse was...ok. I didn't really love it. The sticky caramel that enrobed the entire dessert was fine but the banana mousse tasted a bit too artificial for me. The peanuts were in the cookie crust, the peanut butter quenelle, and the brittle that topped the entire pastry. It's pretty but it didn't rocked my world.Well, that's what happened on today. Now, I'm off to bed. I don't like Daylight Savings...I lost my hour of sleep! Blech.Lastly, if you want to see the action of that \"Spring Forward, Start Grilling,\" just click here. Just be warned, my live action shots are a bit haphazard and I don't like it. I like to take my time taking photos, so these might look crappy.

An \"Artful\" Lunch at the Modern Bar Room

This is arguably the most expensive lunch I ever had. Period. I had lunches from pricey restaurants (e.g. Le Bernardin a few years ago and recently Eleven Madison Park) by trying their prix fixe or tasting menu but it never come to the total that I have paid just a few days ago. You'll understand as I will explain my one time whim and chance to go to The Modern's Bar Room on Tuesday, April 24th.I arrived there at 11:40 A.M., not surprisingly there weren't many diners there since it's early.A few people at the barOther tables waiting for dinersTables toward the backAs I was seated to a table and I was given the menu. I already knew ahead of time what I was ordering and waited a while taking photos that you've seen above and my reflection from the bar room's stainless steel column that was next to me. After a few minutes, my waitress came up and asked me if I \"wanted anything to drink; any wine or cocktails from those menus?\" I replied, \"Yes. I would like to have that rose drink.\" Then she corrected me nicely that cocktail's name is, \"Coming Up Roses.\" She left with that order and came back with it a few minutes later and told her my order of \"Roasted Garlic Gnocchi\" (from Two, an appetizer course like One) and \"Beer Braised Pork Belly\" (from Three, considered as an entrée but a bit smaller). After she wrote those down and left me, I took photos of this mesmerizing drink.\"Coming Up Roses\" with my tap waterTop side view of the drinkLooking down at an angle...Now that's a sight to see for a drink. It's gorgeous with all those rose petals and wedges of lime mingling with the ice cubes. It's effervescent, with hints of roses, raspberry (from the Bacardi Razz, a raspberry flavored rum) and lime. Not at all sweet. Initially it tastes innocent but later on the alcohol kicks in pretty darn well.Then came the bread basket and butter.Close up of the bread basketThe mini baguette was very good. The golden brown, thin, crisp crust, with a chewy crumb was too irresistible for me to stop munching the entire thing. Usually, I just eat half and move on.Baguette on a plateInnardsThe bread underneath the baguettes, is what I think is sliced country bread. It tasted fine but it's basically a soft, spongy, yeasty bread without much textural contrasts for me to be enamored with it.After munching the bread, my appetizer arrived; the Roasted Garlic Gnocchi with wild mushrooms, sage, and crispy sweetbreads ($17).The Roasted Garlic Gnocchi dishI don't know about you, but I LOVE sweetbreads ever since my first encounter at Gramercy Tavern a few years ago (that's obviously before the inception of this blog). This dish does do some justice to the sweetbread since it was crisp but I didn't taste much in terms of flavor except for it's soft texture and earthy flavor. The gnocchi were soft, light, little dumplings that goes well with the sage, earthy, silky wild mushrooms, and crisp sweetbreads. It's a wonderful dish.Close up of the Roasted Garlic GnocchiAfter my dish cleared away and wait for another 5 minutes or so, my Beer Braised Pork Belly ($15) arrived.Whole viewClose up of presented viewClose up with the fatty side showingThe pork belly was incredibly fork tender and it melts in my mouth. I didn't really taste any beer but if it's any indication of beer, it would possibly the heartiness in the flavor of the pork and provided some of the hoppy flavor in the ginger jus. It went well with the sauerkraut that was underneath the pork belly, to give it some sharp, sour-tart contrast to the dish.After finishing my pork belly, I wanted dessert. After glancing the menu, I went for the Hazelnut Dacquoise ($10) and coffee.CoffeeWhole viewClose UpInnardsThe coffee was fine. It's a medium bodied, roasted coffee. Nothing exceptional to note but it tasted fine.The hazelnut dacquoise with filled with milk chocolate chantilly (basically milk chocolate flavored whipped cream). The hazelnut dacquoise was sweet, nutty, crisp, crunchy, with a caramel finish. It was topped with a thin sheet of milk chocolate, milk chocolate whipped cream (chantilly), and another sheet of milk chocolate. It tasted good but it didn't dazzled me in any particular way. I kind of know in advance from reading various reviews that the desserts are good but not in any sense, mind blowing. So, my sweet tooth is not necessarily satiated but it was a bit satisfied.My impression of this place is that it's a good place to have a casual but upscale food that one can bite away (portions are small) but needs to have the finances of doing so. This venture cost me a good amount of money that it would be some time until I'll ever visit here again. I like this place (as many others do as you'll see underneath) and would love to try many other dishes but as I've said, it's expensive.The lunch crowd at 12:30 PMAddress: The Modern: Bar Room 11 W 53rd Street New York, NY 10019

I'm becoming a familiar face for Landmarc. I don't know if that's a good or bad thing that I actually spend my time at Time Warner Center so often. Anyways, I went to Landmarc three times (including the earlier post when it opened on the second day) and counting now.The second time I went to Landmarc was the day after I wrote about Landmarc the first time. In other words I went there the third day of their opening. I went there for breakfast but I ended up ordering from their lunch menu (which is available during the morning) and have the \"Grilled eggplant & tomato tartine, goat cheese & black olive tapenade\" ($10) and a cup of coffee ($4).TartineCoffeeThe coffee was decent. I didn't expect superb coffee from any restaurant honestly but it was fine.The tartine was you can see, is topped with thick slices of eggplant, tomatoes, and sprinkling of goat cheese (also there was a schmear of it under the eggplant as well), on top of a thick slice of slightly charred country bread. The goat cheese's pungent, salty flavor was dominating the entire sandwich but it was slightly offset by the tomato's acidic bite. The eggplant only provided a soft, silky texture to the sandwich but not much in terms of flavor. This was a good sandwich but not my favorite.InnardsYesterday morning at 9:30, I ate breakfast or brunch, as I would consider it, with Robyn and a fellow reader, Kay. We were about to be seated to a table where most of the lights are dim, I requested for a table near the windows just for the sake of good lighting for the food. So, the hostess was kind enough to let us have a booth across the room. Here's the view from our seats.The viewIt's nice but not gorgeous. We took a look at both the breakfast menu and the lunch menu, contemplating for a good five to ten minutes. I can tell we took a long time since our waiter kept hovering around our table seeming to get impatient waiting for us to order something. But finally, we know what we wanted. Robyn ordered an egg sandwich with mozzarella and sautéed onions on an English muffin ($10), Kay wanted the Croque Monsieur ($13) and I ordered Landmarc's Hamburger ($13).As we chat and waited for our food for 10 minutes or so, the condiments arrived to our table.CondimentsAbout another 5 minutes passed 'til our food arrived. Here's the photos...Robyn's Egg SandwichKay's CroqueMy BurgerEveryone seem to have a pretty copious amount of food. Somehow Robyn's plate looks kind of...sad.Robyn offered to share a piece of her sandwich and hash browns to everyone, which I accepted. Her English muffin seemed to be a bit flimsy, that it can't hold the filling together whenever I bite. It's also pretty messy just because the eggs seemed to be scrambled a bit and the cheese and onions were mixed in to kind of hold everything together. It tasted fine but not awesome.Kay's Croque Monsieur was HUGE. I really liked the fact that they plopped about three ounces of cheese and let it melt under their broiler to have that gooey factor in the croque.InnardsAs you can see from the \"innards\" shot, they packed in a ton of ham, enrobed with the melted cheese, all sitting on top of a thick slice of grilled, slightly charred country bread. It was pretty tasty. The ham was still moist, the cheese is melted to a certain stage where it is still gooey and stringy and the crusty bread was a nice contrast to all of the soft, chewiness of the sandwich. This is certainly a hearty sandwich that really fill a hungry person up. In terms of a petite woman, it'll fill her (or me) up for a good half day.As for my burger, I haven't expected a large portion.Burger InnardsThe burger itself, is probably 3 ounces of meat, medium rare (as requested) and very juicy. As Adam, the man behind A Hamburger Today, indicated from my photo from Flickr, that it's coarse ground. It was a good burger but it didn't tasted as good as Shake Shack's.The bun seemed like a brioche (I forgot to ask) and it had a minute sprinkling of salt on top of the bun. It held the meat well, absorbing all of it's juiciness but the meat was still oozing out juices from the bun.They had toppings on the side like thinly sliced, sweet pickles, a slice of raw red onion, and a slice of fresh tomato. When I piled it on the burger, let's just say that there's too much stuff that every time I bite into my burger, it'll start falling out from the other end.The fries were pretty good, it's salted enough, sprinkled with some herbs, and a bit crisp. Not the greatest fries but they were fine. The side salad was the run-of-the-mill salad they serve here, some field greens of mesclun and frisée tossed with some vinaigrette.As time passes from my maiden visit to Landmarc, their service has improved and the food is still good. Landmarc's reputation for their original TriBeca establishment is basically a good wine list, moderately priced food that is good but not extraordinary. I believe Chef Murphy accomplished that same reputation in Time Warner.Address: Landmarc 10 Columbus Circle, 3rd floor New York, NY 10019

Morning Noshings at Bouchon and Agoraphobia(?) at Bryant Park

Ever since Saturday, I've been having some morning noshings at Bouchon Bakery. I know...you all hate me writing about Thomas Keller's cafe but really, where can I go that has tasty pastries that doesn't look and taste like crap and it's really close to my campus?Just to blab all about it in one shot instead of breaking it down so much, for Saturday and Monday I had their Chocolate Cherry Scone ($3.25), Caramel Nut Tart ($7.25), and a Chocolate Praline Pound Cake ($4.75). Yeah...it's all sugary, buttery, carby goodness here.Chocolate Cherry Scone...glossyCaramel Nut TartChocolate Praline Pound CakeThe scone was pretty darn good. It had a good ratio of chocolate chips and dried tart cherries to scone. It was buttery, crisp on the edges, tender, and not terribly dry. This is deemed a good scone in my book.Broken apartInnardsWhen it comes to the Caramel Nut Tart that you saw earlier, it was very good. The crisp, buttery crust (a pâte brisée) with the rich, gooey, sweet caramel filling. They really packed in the nuts to try to justify the high price tag, possibly weighing in a good 3 to 4 ounces of mixed nuts: pistachio, hazelnut, almonds, and walnuts. This is practically my favorite tart from ALL of the tarts I've eaten from Bouchon, since you've got your sweet, crisp, crunchy, and gooey for each delicious bite.The Chocolate Praline Pound Cake was arguably the biggest disappointment. There wasn't much praline flavor or texture going on in that pound cake. Yes, the cake was good; a tender, fine textured crumb but a bit too greasy from the extensive amount of butter used. The only praline I got was that chocolate blob on top of that cake. Everything else was dead from there. Eh...On Monday, it felt like summer. I'm not kidding at all. It was 85 degrees Fahrenheit with the blazing sun beaming down on everyone. As much as I like warm weather, I just don't like hordes of people eating where I am eating and that was Bryant Park. And boy, did I regret it...Honestly, I haven't seen that much midtown office people packed in a park per square inch before. It's scary.You may argue that I am agoraphobic but I'm really not. I just don't like people taking up space where I want to eat. Yes, I may be selfish but is it so much to ask for a small amount of space where I can sit or stand in an area to take a few snapshots of my food and eat it? Anyways, I waited on line at 'wichcraft for 20 minutes in the hot sun for a darn Grilled Fontina cheese sandwich ($9).After I gotten my sandwich, the line has gotten even longer...it reminds me of Shake Shack's but not nearly as bad.1st part of the line2nd part of the lineAnyways, my sandwich.It was gooey and warm when I unwrapped this stinky, cheesy sandwich. The stink isn't a bad thing since Fontina cheese tend to have a bit of funk even though it is a fresh cheese. Also the added funky smell was the use of truffle oil and possibly the trumpet mushrooms but I really doubt the latter. It's a good sandwich but I don't think it warrants $9.75 including tax. I might as well stick with Bouchon's sandwiches for that price and without facing a near heat stroke.Speaking of heat stroke, I felt a bit woozy staying out in the sun so long that I was craving for ICE CREAM! Since I remembered that 'wichcraft does sell ice cream in one of their kiosks, I walked over there and gotten myself a scoop of caramel ice cream ($3; not including tax).Texture shotIt was good ice cream. The caramel flavor was quite potent that one can taste the burnt sugar flavor that should occur in caramel and it had a touch of saltiness that enriches the flavor further. My only problem with this ice cream is that it had too large ice crystals - either from storage (too cold) or the way they made the ice cream that did not create smaller ice crystals to appeal to the palate. I'm not really complaining when I'm dying in this heat.That's what happened for the past half week or so. There's more to write about but I'm lazy at the moment and I still have to edit those photos. But to give you a clue, it's about two restaurants' food.Addresses: Bouchon Bakery 10 Columbus Circle, 3rd Floor New York, NY 10019'wichcraft Avenue Of The Americas & W 42nd St New York, NY 10036

There's been a lot of places opening this week that actually strikes my interest, such as Landmarc in the Time Warner Building and where I visited yesterday afternoon, Roasting Plant, that I've read from Grub Street earlier in this week.To those of you who've read my blog for a while, I'm a java junkie. I live for good coffee (and chocolate but that's a whole 'nother subject). Heck, where I attend to school in the Upper West Side Starbucks is EVERYWHERE that I could only live off of Bouchon Bakery's coffee when I'm in dire need of caffeine. I don't really like Starbucks coffee because it tastes a bit too burnt and their latte is too milky. I'm all for the independent coffeehouses like Joe (for their house drip) or Ninth Street Espresso (for their delicious latte). Sure I like the aforementioned places but I'm always up for a better cup of coffee. Here's the interior photos...Interior viewCool artworkI really love the design of this space, even though it's small but it feels roomy and a great place to hang out for a while. But the thing that gets my attention is this Wonka-esque coffee storage, as you'll see below. Oh, the choices...What I learned from one of the employees, he explained that their coffee (from various regions, e.g. Kenya, Ethiopia, Papua New Guinea, etc.) is roasted on-site and gets rested for about at least overnight to a day, so that the coffee \"de-gases\" so the coffee drinker would not have an initial off taste. Then they load up the beans to that contraption you have seen before and it's ready to be ground and brewed to your cup of coffee (drip and espresso) the moment you order. Now, that's a great idea. I just wish I could have all of that in my house...but I know it's not going to happen anytime soon since I don't have that much space or the money to do so.Anyways, I've gotten myself a medium Ethiopian cup of coffee ($2).At first glance from this cup, this was unexpected: the crema. Crema is usually found in espresso drinks and I have never encountered that when I'm drinking drip coffee in any coffeehouse I've ever been to (and I've been to many). This is certainly most welcome. Since I like some of my coffee with a touch of milk and went to the spot where they had the milk and sugar, they have all of this (seen below). I think my sugar-loving friend who drinks coffee will love to see that for her morning coffee.When I took my first sip of coffee, this is the BEST coffee I have ever encountered so far. It's smooth, some fruity notes, and bold, along with that velvety crema...oh jeez. I need to go down here more often. Somehow I need to plan out how to get down to the LES and up to the Upper West Side just before my classes start. Hmmm...I should mention that they do have really fabulous pastries (I sampled their lemon poppy muffin). I didn't order them just because I wanted a cupcake (which you'll read later on). Here's a few of their pastries sold there...Scones...looks tastyCroissantsDanishesAfter having my much needed caffeine kick, I went off to Sugar Sweet Sunshine for their cupcakes.It's been too long since I went there, I think it's about eight months or so... I just want their cupcake, hoping that it is still as good as I remembered it.PistachioSassy Red Velvet CupcakesAfter contemplating which flavor I want amongst the others, I opted for their \"Yummy Lemon\" cupcake ($1.50).Cupcake in halfCupcake innardsAs you can see, their cupcake is a bit dry. I don't know if their quality has fallen or it's just happen to be a slightly overbaked batch. It still tastes fine though. It had a nice lemony flavor and a sweet icing, with a fine, tender crumb. I'm just a bit disappointed that it wasn't as moist as I have remembered it.Afterwards, I walked over to Whole Foods on Bowery for their pommes frites. I know, very nutritious food. I bought the \"Mini\" portion ($2.99) salted with Red Hawaiian Sea Salt and two sauces, the Roasted Garlic Aioli (basically a mayonnaise) and Moroccan Chermoula Mayo (additional 69 cents since it's an extra sauce).The fritesSaucesThey do give you a lot of sauce than needed and since I was indecisive between two sauces, I ended up splurging (calories and a tiny bit of cost). The fries or frites, are coated in Red Hawaiian sea salt just because I never tasted it before and I might as well try it, amongst the other four choices. Anyways, the fries were fine not extraordinary, as I usually find for Whole Foods' prepared food. The fries were a bit too salty and the fries range from crisp to soggy.Close upThe sauces are mayonnaise based and they are decent. The Moroccan Chermoula was interesting due to the many variations of spices in chermoula.The roasted garlic aioli tasted fine. It had that sweet, roasted garlic flavor with a tiny bit of tang from the mayonnaise.If you really want good pommes frites, I would highly suggest you to go to Pommes Frites in the East Village. Their frites are so much better and consistent, also their sauces are more creative and tastier.I wished had gelato but since I didn't have the stomach space or the time to do so, I have to leave as is. That's my afternoon snacking in the Lower East Side.Addresses: Roasting Plant 81 Orchard St New York, NY 10002Sugar Sweet Sunshine Bakery 126 Rivington Street New York, NY 10002Whole Foods 95 E Houston Street New York, NY 10002Other Stuff To Mention...Some of you wanted to know what some of the pastries my aunt who visited recently, looked like. Here's a Kee Wah Red Bean Paste filled pastry and one of those Green Bean Paste filled pastry from a traditional bakery, Hang Heung. There were a lot more varieties but by the time I took the photos, most were consumed by my family.Red Bean Paste Pasty (unwrapped)Split in halfInnardsWhat I love about Kee Wah is that their pastries have thin, flaky crusts and it's packed with TONS of filling, whether it's bean paste or lotus paste (my fave), and I haven't found any Chinese bakery in NYC that has that kind of quality.The boxA mess of a box of green bean filled pastriesThe pastryInnardsI had a Kee Wah version of this above pastry, obviously Kee Wah is better just because there's so much more filling. This one from Hang Heung, had a really thick, flaky crust and not so much paste filling. Their wife cakes and red bean cakes fared a lot better but my mom ate most of them that it's gone by the time I took photos.One last note, there's a new food site where you can customize and create your own favorite food establishments and reviews (from blogs or food critic reviews) called the Foodist Colony. Check it out NOW! Please and thank you. :)

Kay: I heart Kee Wah...I really wish that they open a branch in NYC but I don't think it's going to happen anytime soon. I don't really eat pastries in C-town except for egg custard tarts.Kathryn: Yeah, that coffee was awesome. I just wish that it would be closer to my campus.

I just asked my dad to send me a box of Kee Wah today! :) So happy! Yeah..I went into one of the pastry shops in Chinatown a few weeks ago that sold the type of pastries Kee Wah has and everything looked like it was before the Cultural Revolution!

I know my long absence from this blog might have let a few of you readers wondering what the heck is going on? Well, as you have noticed since last week I have been complaining about school work, e.g. papers and tests, it's making my fooding life has practically rendered to nothing. The only thing that is keeping me sane these days is blasting my iPod with Linkin Park's songs. I'm feeling a bit burnt out but I'm bearing it...barely.Anyways, as some or few of you might have known Landmarc has opened its doors in the Time Warner Building from various reports from Grub Street, Eater and Restaurant Girl on Monday. I went there today just because I heard their food's good (the original establishment in TriBeca) and I need to treat myself with food (it's a tough week).I know that I should wait at least a week or so for any restaurant's opening so that any errors in service and whatnot are usually solved and smoothed out. But since I was hungry and I don't want to go for another round of Bouchon Bakery (which is practically right next door and I know you are sick and tired of me writing about their food). I just gone in and asked for a table for myself. I requested a seat near the windows, for obvious reasons that I want the most natural light possible to get some good food photos for you. My request was obliged but I was warned that it might be cold but I could bear it. Here's the view out of the windows.Looking at the corner of Central Park...As I unfolded the menu, you'll know what I mean once you see the photo, and perused the menu, I noticed that it's the same exact lunch menu they have published on their own website.My waitress came to my table and I ordered two appetizers: the roasted bone marrows and the goat cheese profiteroles. After she took my order and left me, I went on to take some interior photos.One thing struck me is that there weren't many patrons yet since it is a \"new\" restaurant and I don't think the majority of the public knew about it; from this photo, you'll see that there weren't many diners here at the time of about 12:30 P.M.When I first arrived to the third floor a bit earlier, Bouchon Bakery was packed with people. Anyways, my water was served after taking a few photos and here it is. I just find it a bit unusual that they would give me a carafe of water. It almost never happen to me whenever I eat out but it's a welcome change.My food came out approximately five minutes later. I requested them to come out at the same time. To my stupidity, I should have asked them to come out separately but whatever, I'm just hungry. Here's the food.I ate my Roasted Bone Marrows ($12) first.Roasted Bone MarrowsIt's served with onion marmalade and slices of grilled country bread. I wasn't expected a large portion like this would be served. To the public who fears or intimidated in eating animal parts, beef bone marrow is basically fat. You just eat the gelatinous, fatty, soft tissue in the center of the bones, as butter. It needed salt, which was served along the bones, and the onion marmalade brings a sweet, wine-y flavor to the party. The grilled country bread was chewy, crusty, crisp, and nicely charred that it imparted some bitterness that made all these flavors intriguing and delicious. This is hearty comfort food...in my world but obviously, I can't eat this everyday before I'm clogging my arteries even further. Here's some food porn on this. Trust me, try this from either this place or anywhere that can prepare animal innards well, and you'll be hooked.Marrow on grilled country breadMarrow + onion marmalade on grilled country breadThe Warm Goat Cheese Profiteroles ($10) were room temperature by the time I gotten to eat it. At first glance I already have issues with it, and it's not about the temperature of the food. I only have three profiteroles and paying $10 does not justify that price tag. I might as well stick with Artisanal's basket of gougeres for $8.50. And later I found out later that one of those profiteroles weren't filled at all. The salad was nicely dressed but nothing really remarkable to note about. Here's the photos of the profiteroles.The plateInnardsEven though I had those issues, they tasted pretty good. The salty, slightly pungent, tangy goat cheese worked well with the slightly chewy profiterole.I didn't bother telling my server my issue with the unfilled profiterole since I have been ignored for over ten minutes after I finished my appetizers. By the time she came back to my table, she asked if I wanted anything else. I requested dessert, the \"one of everything.\" As I waited, the table across from mine had the same and a large mound of cotton candy on the side. Same goes to the party sitting behind me. To my disappointment, I was not served the cotton candy. But at least I got my desserts ($15). Here's the dessert flight.I started off with the Blueberry crumble.This was really good. The crisp, buttery topping meld so well with the warm, tart blueberries.The Crème brûlée was next.Spooned...This was wonderfully creamy. The thin burnt sugar crust gave it an added sweet bitterness to this velvety smooth vanilla custard. This is one of my favorites from this tasting.The Nutella éclair...Another view of the éclairI had some high hope that the éclair would be any good as the goat cheese profiterole but it turned out to be a soggy, chewy, slightly tasteless puff pastry. After my first bite, I stopped eating it. It didn't appealed to me and I was getting to the stage where my stomach is telling my brain that \"I'm FULL,\" so I need to save space.Next up, the Tiramisu.It's awesome. The vanilla custard was thick, rich, and velvety. It didn't have much of the rum-soaked ladyfinger or sponge cake, which I find it to be better since I love custard more than cake in a tiramisu. But there was a kick of espresso and rum once I hit the bottom of the cup. Another favorite.The Chocolate mousse...It was a luxuriously rich chocolatey (tasted like 60% cocoa solids used), smooh, slightly dense mousse. I'm swooned for this mousse. I'm lacking words to express my joy over this mousse.Spooned Chocolate MousseLast but not least, the Lemon Tart.The tart had a really tart, vibrant, refreshing lemon flavor with a nice flaky, crisp crust. I don't usually like lemon desserts too often but I have to admit this is pretty darn good.After I finished eating the tart, I paid my check. Unexpectedly, my waitress gave me my check when I was in the middle of eating dessert. Hmm...also they gave me some in-house made caramels with the check.CaramelsWhen I actually ate one of those caramels, I find them too hard and chewy but the flavor was good and it's just sweet. After I paid, I just walked around the place and take more interior photos just for the sake of being there and there isn't that many people interfering except the occasional busboy, waitress, etc. who needs to pass by. Here's a couple more photos...Looks cool...the lamp, I'm referring toView from the barSince this review in ways, shouldn't be taken into grave consideration due to the fact that it is their second day of opening they do need to work a few bugs out, mostly in terms of service and for the food, I feel that they should serve at least another profiterole or two to make me feel that I'm getting what I'm paying for. So if Chef Marc Murphy and his staff are reading this, please address these issues. I'm planning to visit them for breakfast soon.Addresss: Landmarc Restaurant 10 Columbus Circle, 3rd Floor New York, NY

To everyone (generally): Wow! I haven't expected such a turnout for this particular post. Thanks for reading! Now to the individual comments...Michael (BigAppleDiningGuide): You're welcome! :) I don't mind having lunch with anyone, actually...Ellen: Thank you!Doug: LOL! Thanks...I guess on ordering. Thanks about the photo comment. As for school, the work will temporarily slow down a bit after tonight.Erika: You gotta try bone marrow! It's REALLY good. Think in terms of foie gras but in jelly form.Robyn: YOU CERTAINLY CAN!! Eh, I know you're not an early bird like me...but we'll make it work somehow.Kathy: Hahaha! :D I love bone marrow, too! It's so hard to find it in NYC, unless you know some restaurants who would cook that stuff...I'm craving for more animal innards ever since I ate the marrow. :/

The food looks good and at a reasonable price! I love eating bone marrows but sometimes it can taste a bit too fatty. I'd love to have lunch with you too! :)

Peter: I've just read it this morning. Hmmm...probably I should read Ms. Jacobs' book.Kay: I agree that bone marrows can be a bit too fatty but it's not meant to be eaten everyday. I think of it like foie gras, it's meant for certain occasions.Woohoo...! Another person to go fooding with. :)

My husband and I went to Landmarc for breakfast in the middle of May.  Found the food good but a bit chintzy -- we ordered the yogurt with granola and berries and received a huge bowl of yogurt with about three tbls. of granola and a handful of blueberries and strawberries. It was the service that bothered us the most --  slow and faulty -- with at least 6 waiters standing around, not one ever came to refill our water glasses or our coffee cups.  I'd have thought that the waiters would have been better trained by then, almost three weeks after opening.  I will go back but if they hope to become a successful neighborhood place as they are in TriBeCa, they should get on their toes.

This is to back track everything that has happened the entire week or so. Starting with some homemade bread.I made this bread before I actually ate out with my aunt (the one who's visiting from Hong Kong) from my earlier post, at Chung Moo Roo but since I don't really have a real recipe for you to write about except that it's a very close derivative of Rose Levy Beranbaum's Cinnamon Raisin Bread from The Bread Bible except that I used whole wheat flour (about 15 - 20% total) to make it healthy.My aunt is somewhat of a health conscious person, so that's why I did that. However, I did make it a bit \"bad\" by making a barely sweetened chocolate paste for the swirl portion of the bread. All I did was use about 1/2 cup of unsweetened Valhrona cocoa powder, 3 tablespoons of granulated sugar and 3 tablespoons of melted butter and mix it up to a paste and let it solidify to a paste.Here's the before and after baking photos: Unbaked loafUnbaked bread in a cake panBaked innards shot of loafBaked bread in cake panThey came out really well, since my aunt loved it. The only criticism she gave me was that she didn't like the chocolate. It's not that it was too sweet or too bitter; it's the fact that she doesn't really like chocolate that much. The good news is that she ate 95% of the entire batch, which was the two pans of bread that you saw. Nevertheless, I'm happy about that. (If you want the basic recipe, just e-mail me and I'll send it to you.)In exchange for my bread, she brought a ton of pastries from Hong Kong that I'm totally enamored with. However, most of them have been kind of bashed up so I don't know if their photogenic enough to make it to this blog...but it's mostly Cantonese pastries from Kee Wah Bakery. I know there's one in Los Angeles, California but I'm not planning to go there anytime soon, since it's been 7 or 8 years since I've been there and I don't really love L.A. but that's my opinion. The other pastries are the traditional wife cake from a bakery that does not have a website nor does it have an English name, so I'm not going to attempt to translate it for you but I might post up a photo in the near future.Moving on... (since my D.C. trip was over and my aunt and her son flew back to Hong Kong yesterday afternoon)On Tuesday, I went to SoHo for no real apparent reason and went to Ceci Cela originally for their croissant, since Robyn did mention that it was pretty good. However, as I perused their pastry cases I saw MACARONS! I didn't even know they sell macarons since it wasn't mentioned on their website or by anyone else. Since I have an obsession with macarons amongst a hundred other foods, I bought a package of macarons that contained a dozen of them for $15. (You will see them a bit later with photos and analysis.)I did not want to eat in there just because when I look at the back of the patisserie, it looked pretty dim. So, I schlepped myself all the way to Dumbo, Brooklyn. I know there's no logic behind this but considering the fact that I am a \"wandering eater\" I did this unintentionally to try Almondine Bakery's chocolate cupcake ($2.50), which you have probably seen before either by looking at my Flickr page or from my Update post. Here's the photo again...and other views of the cupcake.Cupcake split in halfInnardsAs you can see, the cupcake looked pretty dry from the innards shot. It's quite unfortunate since it had a good ratio of frosting to cake (as Robyn commented on flickr). The cake had a nice hint of chocolate, tender, again dry for the most part except that thin layer that touches the slightly sweetened, almond accented frosting. The bright red-orange white chocolate curl was a nice aesthetic touch but didn't really do much in terms of texture. The odd thing is that when I was noshing on my cupcake, a lot of people are ordering their cakes. I'm wondering, would their cake be a better choice than their cupcake? Hmmm...I'm asking you people who have tried it. PLEASE do comment on this if you have.Since I have a table for myself, I started to taste (actually more like eating) the macarons from Ceci Cela. The package of macciesUnwrapped...First stack of macarons from the bottom up: chocolate, lemon, and raspberrySecond stack of macarons from bottom to top: vanilla, pistachio and coffeeMacaron innardsHere's the brief analysis: All of these macarons are petite; they are about 1 1/2 inch in diameter and 1 1/8 inch tall, as you can see below. Tiny...All of the cookies have a low ratio of filling compared to the cookie. Most of them lacked flavor. All I'm tasting is almond and sweetness of the sugar used in the cookie. But at least the cookies were crisp on the outside and a bit chewy on the inside.The one with the most flavor was the raspberry due to the fact that the jam was quite tart, bright and sharp that one can detect it's raspberry instead of being confused if the filling is supposed to be the former or strawberry, which had happened on a few occasions when I was with Robyn on our macaron hunt a little over a week ago. The ones with the least flavor were the lemon and pistachio. The lemon didn't really taste like lemon; only detected a very faint hint of lemon but the dominant flavor was almond. The same goes for the pistachio. I was really disappointed with these macarons.After being induced into a sugar coma, I walked out of Almondine and to the nearby docks in Dumbo. Even though it looks gorgeous, it was terribly chilly and windy. But still, I took some cityscape photos of downtown Manhattan. I think it looks straight to Chelsea Piers but I could be wrong.On Wednesday morning, I didn't really have breakfast (unless you consider a cup of coffee and a banana breakfast) and it was 10 AM. I went to, as you can guess by now, Bouchon Bakery, for a chocolate almond croissant ($2.95) and a large cup of coffee ($2.15).Chocolate Almond CroissantInnardsThis is arguably the most decadent croissant I've sank my teeth into as of recent. It's packed with two sticks of chocolate, wrapped with flaky, buttery layers of dough, topped with a thin layer of almond paste in the center, then layered with almond slices then snowed with confectioners' sugar at the end of the process. Yep, it's really decadent. It tastes good but my small tiff is that it's a bit too dense but at the same time it's not a true croissant since it's embellished with so many things.For today, the weather is absolutely crappy. It's windy, cold, and rainy. Heck, the winds were bad during the morning hours that my umbrella broke and I had to buy one from a local Duane Reade as an emergency replacement. Obviously I don't want to go out walking around the city for a different place to eat, so again, I went to Bouchon for lunch.This time I went for their Ham and Cheese Croissant ($7.75), Focaccia ($5.25) and a large coffee. Yes, I need my coffee and I was hungry.Ham and Cheese Croissant, pressedI did request the ham and cheese croissant to be pressed. Even though it's warmed, the cheese didn't melt. The good part is that the ham was not dry like last time when I had their baguette version, as you'll see here. The croissant was very flaky and buttery. It's really indulgent and I needed it since I feel like crap for the entire week.FocacciaTo my surprise, Bouchon seemed like they added a new item, the focaccia bread. It's basically focaccia bread leaden with olive oil, topped with lots of garlic that slowly roasted to a soft, candy-like state, thinly sliced potatoes, and rosemary. It's a pretty large piece they've given me, about 3 1/2 inches deep, 5 inches wide and 7 inches long. The flavors worked nicely but I don't see the point of adding the potato slices. They don't really contribute much in terms of flavor, since the sweet roasted garlic, rosemary and olive oil are the dominant flavors of this chewy bread. I really loved the edges since they're really crunchy. I should've asked them to warm up the bread so it'll be crunchier and it doesn't actually feel cold in my mouth. They stored the focaccia in the refrigerated savory foods case, which I thought it was kind of an odd way to store focaccia.That's basically it. I've updated this blog to the fullest extent possible and now, back to studying for an upcoming test and writing my history paper. Oh joy... Have a great weekend!Addresses: Ceci Cela Patisserie 55 Spring Street New York, NY 10012Almondine Bakery 85 Water Street Brooklyn, NY 11201Bouchon Bakery Time Warner Center 10 Columbus Circle, 3rd Floor New York, NY 10021

hehe, I think Bouchon should be paying you for publicity! or at the very least, they should cover your food costs :)i LOVE ke wah bakery! I always pick up a wife cake (or two) when I'm in the monterey park area. and here, all this time i was thinking i was the only college aged kid who liked wife cakes!

Kathy: Ehh...I don't think Bouchon or Thomas Keller gives a damn about giving them publicity. Since there's never enough seating during the lunch hours or the morning breakfast time. I wish they'll cover my food costs but I doubt it'll ever happen.Finally there's someone who knows what I'm talking about and it's within my age group! LOL. I don't really care for the Kee Wah's wife cakes though. My aunt got that from a different bakery that does it more traditional. From Kee Wah, I LOVE their flaky pastries that is shaped like a dome and it's packed with about 1/4 cup of red bean paste or lotus paste. Mmmm... I'm going to get one from my fridge now. :)I'll try to post some photos of the stuff my aunt gotten for me...but most of them are eaten by me or by my parents. So it'll be severely limited photos.

I have about an hour to write this post for you before I go to class. Since this lunch I'm writing about now took place last Friday, I might as well tell you about this meal in K-town that I had with my aunt and her son who are visiting from Hong Kong.The reason why I'm in the city on a Friday afternoon, which normally never happens since I don't have classes on Friday and it's my (so called) Spring Break, it's because my aunt wanted to see the Macy's Flower Show in Herald Square. No, I'm not going to put up anymore flower pictures, since most of them didn't come out too well so you're not going to suffer anymore of that.Back to the food. My cousin was dying for some food since it's 1:30. My mother also accompanied us and wanted to get some decent food around here since it's cold that Friday afternoon. I suggested if they wanted Korean food since I don't like any sandwiches around here and I'm not in a sandwich mood. My aunt agreed with that suggestion and I took all of them over to K-town which is just three blocks away.Here's the rice portion of the lunch menu:The tea served and the restaurant's interior:Interior shotThe tea is basically the same for all other Korean restaurants that I've been to so far, the hyunmi cha, which is the rice cracker flavored tea. It's good and it's warm.Edit 4/14/07: I ordered for the group: Ddukbagi Bulgogi, Gobdol Bimibap, Gamjatang, Godeunguh Gui (the grilled mackerel)  and the Duenjang Chigae (Miso Soup).After my order, came in the banchan.They're all good but the kimchi was a bit too spicy for my palate.Then came ALL the food... Ddukbagi BulgogiDdukbagi Bulgogi (zoomed in)Fish stew (forgotten the name)Gobdol BimibapGamjatang (sorry again for the blurriness) Godeunguh Gui (sorry for the blurriness)The last photo was blurred since my aunt started to de-bone apart the fish. So once again, sorry for the blurriness of it all.The Ddukbagi Bulgogi was a really sweet beef soup, which actually surprised me in a good way. It was pretty hearty and it's my favorite out of all the soups and stews that I've ordered.The Gobdol Bimibap is my favorite Korean rice dish. Somehow the sizzling hot stone bowl filled with rice, vegetables and a raw egg being slightly cooked up in it, appeals to me. It's really tasty.My bowl of Gobdol BimibapThe Gamjatang is a spicy pork bone stew that is chocked full of vegetables but not that much potatoes as the menu indicated. It's delicious, hearty and it really warms your mouth and your insides.The Godeunguh Gui was delicious dish of broiled mackerel. It's cooked perfectly with a nicely broiled skin and moist flesh, and it's seasoned well.The whole bill for the group of 4 came out to be about $13 per person, which isn't that expensive. The dish that really boosted the check was the broiled mackerel since it's off the lunch menu and it costs about $13 and everything else was under $10.Address: Chung Moo Roo 10 W. 32nd Street New York, NY

Hello~  I lovelovelove your blog- mainly for your taste in foods, especially french pastries.  I'm planning to go back to Paris for the upcoming summer to intern PatisFrance, a pastry ingredients import/export company!  Need to get my hands on Laduree macaroons... fuchon chocolates........ on the street crepes, and undo the Spring-gym hours.Anyway, i just wanted to give you props, and also, give you a small correction.  \"duenjang chigae\" is the miso-like soup/stew you had, and \"godeunguh gui\" is the mackerel.  You seem to know this in the longer post, but in the intro it's mixed up. Just so you know :]  I'm korean and i'm kind of dying in college without my fermented cabbage.....

Mercy: Thanks for loving my blog! :D
Even though I have a HUGE obsession with French food, you should go to Robyn's blog, The Girl Who Ate Everything as a great reference for fooding areas since she's been there a couple of weeks ago for spring break and spent an entire semester in Paris. You must try Pierre Herme's macarons! For my sake?! (Did I mention I'm a bit jealous that you're going to Paris for the summer? ;) )I don't know Korean food that much, as you can tell. I just like eating it since it's so tasty. The correction will be made.Oh, you poor thing! Where's your college located?

I'm sorry that I haven't written in a LONG time. I'm just writing this mostly non-food post for the sake of letting you know I'm still alive (and possibly bordering insanity; it's explained as you read on).It's just because my aunt and her bratty 8 year-old son visited over my remaining half of my so-called spring break. My family and my aunt and her child went down to Washington D.C. for the sake of the cherry blossoms and everything else that is aesthetically appealing...which mostly was flowers or sparkly jewelry from the Smithsonian Natural History Museum.The food scene was so disappointing for the budgeted! The French bistro I wanted to go doesn't have enough tables for a group of six people. The even more sadder thing was that I went there twice on different times and they still don't have a table for six. I had to suffer disgusting food from D.C.'s Chinatown on the first night and eaten a mediocre lunch. Ehh... at least I survived. Here's a photo of one of my favorite flowers, the orchid, from this trip that somewhat justifies me being down there.The other reasons why I haven't written in a while is because the Monday after my Easter weekend from D.C., I had an hour and a half interview for my hope-to-be summer internship at an enormous law office in Times Square. The location is not my desirable place to be but I don't care, as long I have a darn internship! And I felt drained from that lengthy interview. Then I have to write two final papers for my classes, which takes out even more of my food blogging time. Oy, I'm really busy. I hope I can write a real in-depth food entry for everyone soon. Probably around early next week. But I will leave you with this something food related for this post to look at (or possibly lick your screen...?). It's a chocolate cupcake from Almondine Bakery in Dumbo, Brooklyn.You may leave any food related comments...I miss talking/writing to you people.

Easter Edition: Chocolates from La Maison du Chocolat and Bouchon Bakery

About a little more than a week ago, I was tempted to the marketing of La Maison du Chocolat's Easter chocolates and bought a cute bunny for $16 and a couple of their bonbons. Yup, I'm a sucker for their chocolates. But who can actually resist them?On the same day, I wanted to try Bouchon Bakery's chocolate as well so I bought a bag of 16 pieces of truffles for $25 (contains 4 flavors as you'll read on). I kind of regret buying it but I want to know how their chocolates taste like. I did a few days later but first here's some photos...Click on the photo for the names/flavors of each.La Maison's bonbons are always superb. It's sophisticated, sweet enough to satisfy the sweet tooth, and the chocolate is wonderfully dark and delicious.LMDC's bunny with Bouchon's trufflesLa Maison's chocolate bunny actually comes with a few chocolate pieces of their praline egg and solid chocolate pieces of fish. It's cute and it was all yummy!Now, the question remains, is Bouchon Bakery's truffles any good? To tell you the truth, I've had better. I would say it's an equivalent to Godiva chocolate's quality. The chocolate was decent and their fillings were too sweet for me. I would presume it would appeal to the mainstream, novice chocolate lover.The Coconut (the one in all white on the far upper left corner) is a bit too sweet for my palate but it had a good toasted coconut flavor.The Passionfruit (the one with an orange shell) had a nice tart flavor - the best of the group but I don't like white chocolate that much.The Plain truffle (the darkest in color of the bunch) tasted like it was about 60% cocoa mass, which is not really dark enough for me to be satisfied as a plain truffle, and it was too sweet. I would like to have a slight bitter bite of a dark, plain chocolate truffle.The Salted Caramel is good and it had that burnt caramel flavor but it didn't appeal to me that much.

Sublime desserts at Kyotofu

***CONTENT
On Tuesday night, I went to Kyotofu with Kim for an evening dessert tasting invitation by one of the co-owners, Nicole Bermensolo. Those of you who have read my daytime dessert flight at Kyotofu a month or so ago, the menu is slightly different during the evenings.I just love how they used the candles to dimly light the room.Here's part of the evening menu...The first dessert of the evening, the Signature Sweet Tofu.This tofu reminds me of my childhood. Let me explain this. Every Saturday morning, when I was eight years old, my parents always go to Flushing for the weekly trip to buy produce there and they always buy a quart of steaming hot dofu fa and share amongst all of us.This dessert is basically the same concept except that the soy milk used is of an exceptionally better quality and it's served cold. This smooth, silky dessert was slightly sweetened with a \"black sugar\" sauce, which tastes like the Asian brown sugar in a syrup form.Next up, the Warm Raspberry Mochi Chocolate Cake.Close up of the Mochi Chocolate CakeIt was warm enough to melt the green tea-anko cream...InnardsYeah, I'm a bit photo-obsessed with this cake. This was good. This is an upside down chocolate soufflé topped with a green tea-anko cream. (To those of you who don't know what anko is, it's a red bean paste.), which is creamy, gooey texture with an earthy, slightly bitter and grassy taste due to the bean paste and the green tea. It's lovely how the contrast of tastes and textures of this cake harmonious clash together.The Black Sesame Tofu...This tofu is slightly different from the signature, since it's more nuttier, a slight grittier texture due to the toasted black sesame seeds that are ground together. It's interesting that as you work your way down the glass, the nutty flavor gets more concentrated. The hoji-cha tea syrup enhance the sweetness of the tofu and the tuile is the perfect, crisp contrast to the silkiness of the tofu.The tasting plate and Okara cookies...Okara cookiesWe started with the Ginger Infused Japanese Rice Okayu first.This is basically a Japanese version of a rice pudding. It's creamy, decadent and what's nice about this pudding is the use of dried tart cherries to impart a sour-tart flavor, and the candied ginger delivering a spicy kick.Next up, the Mini Miso Choco Cake.InnardsUsually this is provided during the lunch menu, but it was offered to us. This cake, has a salty bite in the beginning from the miso, then comes the wave of chocolate hitting the tongue with a pleasant toasty, nutty flavor of the sesame seeds. I really love this cake since it's also quite fudge-y.And last but not at all least, the Toasted Walnut Tahitian Vanilla Parfait.InnardsThis parfait is wonderfully light, creamy and it has great vanilla flavor. The strange thing that Kim had done was that she took a small portion of the mini miso choco cake and a bite of the vanilla parfait and ate it together. The photo below explains what she thought and felt when she ate them...She's uh...having a foodgasm...and actually physically doing that reaction. When she passed through that phase, she encouraged me to do so, which I have. This led me to this physical expression.I'm floored how good those two were together. The light, creaminess of the parfait meets the intense, nutty, chocolatey cake leads to one intensely, insanely good combination that left me speechless and in awe.Address: Kyotofu 705 Ninth Avenue New York, NY

oooooooh, no fair is all I have to say! How I'm envying all those dishes! But I'm happy that you had a chance to taste all those desserts - that's crazy!
ps
your photo skills are getting better with every post! :)

What?  You were invited by one of the co-owners?  How cool.  I've wanted to go for the longest time, but it looks so pricey.

Kathy: Thanks! In regards about my photo skills are getting better. :)Jessica: I was invited after I paid for my lunch/dessert flight when I was there a couple of weeks ago. Nicole who did serve me, inquired about the fact if I worked for the press or not but; I told her I write a food blog. After I paid my check, she told me that  she was one of the owners of Kyotofu then offered me this tasting, which I'm still thanking her and her other co-owner Mike for. I'm still shocked that it was offered and happened.You can do it during the daytime. I strongly suggest the sweet sampler ($8) which does have that miso choco cake that I'm totally enamored with, along with a bunch of other stuff.

Wow! It was quite an experience just looking at it. I envy you. We go to Japanese restaurants but I never see that many great desserts on a single place. I bookmark the address for my next trip to New York.Talking about the Mini Miso Choco Cake, it must be heavenly. A Spanish restaurant in my neighborhood serves something similar. It is a chocolate molten cake with fleur de sel and olive oil. My husband said one time after eating one that he could die at that moment and be happy.  He was right. Pure pleasure!

Kim: Wow. Chocolate molten cake, fleur de sel and olive oil?! It sounds YUMMY! Reminds me in an odd way of olive oil gelato I've had a couple of months ago.

If I ever get to New York I'm going to have to try miso choco cake... I don't think I've seen anything like that attempted in Japan. It seems like it could work... salty-sweet is the new old thing, after all. I live in the land of salt-covered chocolate caramels.Kuromitsu (black sugar sauce) is made from kokutou, which is made differently than brown sugar but still has a molasses-like quality that you'd find in the American version. Kutomitsu sometimes features added honey. I love that flavor. It'll make a small appearance on my blog tomorrow, too.

2007-04-09 17:39:00
Jason: You got to try the miso choco cake! I LOVE that little decadent thing...even though it's made with tofu, it's still pretty darn good.Anyways, thanks for letting me know what's kuromitsu. I wouldn't have known. I'll be reading your blog about it! :)

My Last Breakfast at Bouchon, Birdbath, and Cones

I started my morning off at Bouchon Bakery for one last time. Most of their morning staples are there, from croissants to sandwiches, the few changes to their menu for summer, they had a berry tart and something that caught my eye for breakfast, the Apricot Elderflower Danish ($3.25). Doesn't that sound tantalizing?Side view of danishIn half...InnardsThis was one decadent danish. The danish itself basically had the crisp, flaky texture of a croissant but it's filled with creamy vanilla custard and some type of elderflower flavored jam, topped with chopped dried apricots, a sprig of elderflowers, and pistachios. Yums. The flower flavor did not overpower this pastry at all but enough to cut through the dense, vanilla custard and buttery flavor of the pastry. This was a good, final breakfast to remember by until my final semester in college arrives again. I am going to miss their gorgeous, photogenic food. [Sniffles.]Later on the afternoon, I went down to the West Village to Birdbath.Birdbath considers themselves an environment conscious bakery; where the walls are made of wheat, cups are made of corn and are biodegradable, and so forth (according to their website). I didn't exactly cared about the environment friendliness of the bakery, even though it is cute, I just wanted their baked goods. Yeah, it's my sweets lovin' self that brought me here.Wall of COOKIES!Apple Butter Cake with Bourbon Raisins[Save the Polar] Bear ClawsApple Miso Cake...is that tasty?Interior decor shotsI've been staring at their baked goods, contemplating for a good five minutes. Eventually, I ended up ordering a bear claw ($4), an oatmeal coconut cookie ($1), and an iced hibiscus tea ($2.50).The bear claw's crust was delicate, very flaky, buttery, and just sweet. The filling was made of dried chopped figs. OMG, I love figs. This pastry made me really happy...and a mess to eat.InnardsThe oatmeal cookie is huge! It's as large as a dessert plate, and I'm not kidding. This sweet, crisp, buttery cookie had large flakes of coconut and a toasty nutty flavor from the oatmeal. I just ate half of it since it's so large...InnardsLater on, after walking around West Village for a while, I eventually went to Cones for their gelato. Yes, I have an obsession with gelato, but it's summer. How can you not want some dense, creamy, cold, dairy dessert in this hot weather?Some of their gelato and sorbet flavorsAfter thinking a while what flavors to order, I asked and tried their pistachio gelato. It didn't really have the same pistachio deliciousness as I had in Grom. [Sighs] Eventually, I ended up with a medium cup of gelato, dulche de leche and a dark chocolate ($4.61).Texture shotLooks creamy to me...The dulche de leche is sweet, rich, slightly caramelized flavor. It's lovely and the dark chocolate is pretty good, too. I like their gelato but Grom has a special place in my heart. I guess I'm really addicted to Grom but disappointed from my previous trip, where they completely leveled my cup and hope it's not true. I'll be there very soon.Addresses: Bouchon Bakery 10 Columbus Circle, 3rd Floor New York, NY 10019Birdbath 7th Avenue South & Charles Street New York, NY 10014Cones 272 Bleecker Street New York, NY 10014

The guy working last week dropped an apple-miso cake in with my cookies so I could try it-it's more like a muffin-cake, but definitely very tasty, with that special zing from the miso :)

Did the dulce de leche and dark choc go well together - is the chocolate sweet? I think it would work well if it wasn't.

Crystal: Ooh…probably I’ll get my hands on one when I drop by there next time. I guess that “zing” is from either that fermentation of the miso or the saltiness. Sounds good from your description.Doug: The dark chocolate was sweet. I would place it along the lines of the sweetness of a semisweet chocolate bar. Not very sweet but not bitter either.

As I've told you from the previous post, I'm going to backtrack all the foods I've eaten before last Wednesday night. It'll be broken down into a few posts before you'll be bombarded with a TON of words and photos that you'll stop reading by the time I'm talking about Tuesday. So, here's just one place that I've eaten on the day of my finals where I had a two hour break and had lunch at Sullivan Street Bakery.This sandwich from Sullivan St. Bakery was mentioned in NY Magazine's Sandwich of the Week, about three weeks ago and NYC Nosher also raved this sandwich as well. Since I love a sandwiches (not the generic deli stuff) and I love Sullivan Street's ciabatta, I thought why not visit there? It's been a while since I've paid a visit.Sullivan Street BakeryToo tempting...It was about 1:30 PM by the time I arrived there, so most of the sandwiches were sold out. The one I really wanted to try was the PMB (pancetta mango and basil), which is their interpretation of the BLT (bacon tomato and lettuce). The ones they had were the Specotto, panino di bresaola, and the panino di aglio baguna cauda ($6). I ordered the latter, since it was happily reviewed by the aforementioned sources and amongst the foodies.Unwrapped...ChompedThis sandwich was sublime. The flauto (the name of this sandwich bread) had a thin, delicate, crisp, crusty exterior with a soft, light, chewy crumb. This is excellent sandwich bread. The filling is also excellent to boot. The layering of hard-cooked duck eggs, artichoke hearts (chewy, briny flavor), and chopped ramps (delicious, oniony-garlic flavor), and a good drizzle of bagna càuda dressing. This was a satisfying sandwich; it's just too bad I didn't have enough time to take in all of its glory since I have to take my last final 45 minutes from now...Address: Sullivan Street Bakery 533 W 47th Street New York, NY 10036

I know I haven't written something significant for a while. I'm sorry. It's just the finals were driving me mad and I had to put blogging on hold. I kind of regret it now since I'm backed up for a good week's worth of food and so much photo editing (Argh...). I want to shoot myself in the foot for doing so. But I'm fine and school's over.Please note, I'm skipping a bunch of food stuff that happened since Wednesday night was the most unusual experience I ever had in my life. In a good way.To keep this story not too complicated, back about a week ago someone from SIRIUS Radio e-mailed me an invitation to Martha Stewart's premiere broadcast of her satellite radio show, At Martha's Table.The invite...whoa.My first reaction was, \"Huh? How did they (technically, she, of public relations) get my e-mail?\" I never would have thunk that a major corporation would even think of inviting me to such an event. But I did RSVP for the event. When I actually got to speak to her on the phone the afternoon before, she told me that there are other \"good grade blogs\" that are involved with this event as well. So, I thought I would see some familiar faces of people I read...as in the blogs I read along the sidebar on the right of your screen. I tagged Ariel (the guy I ate dinner with Kyotofu recently) along for the evening. Even though he had other plans, I persuaded him with some haute cuisine (Jean George's Vong hors d'oeuvres) and booze at a bar opening, after this event.On the evening of the event, I checked-in and got my name badge and a security pass to get up the elevators.Hi! My name is...When I actually glanced at the name badges on that table, I realized I'm stuck with a bunch of execs there, not many food bloggers, as far as I could see. I only saw a guy writing for the Gothamist.Where's the bloggers out there?Anyways, I went through the whole security check and up the elevators to the 36th floor and got myself some water from the bar. They were serving two wines (a Pinot Blanc from Vin d'Alsace and a 2005 Castle Rock Pinot Noir) water (S.Pellegrino sparkling water and Evian).The Pinot BlancThe Pinot NoirEventually I tried the Pinot Noir and I find it to be fine. It's not the most superb wine I ever tasted but it was good. It's fruity, floral. Acidic initially with bit of an abrasive note at the end. I wasn't really expecting much from a catered party since the focus was the food more than the wine.Anyways, Ariel found me and we just talked for a while until they started to send out the hors d'oeuvres. Here's the first round.Ain't that a sight to see? The appetizers are crêpe-like pasta wrapping filled with cream cheese(?), mushrooms, and caviar, topped with edible gold (I don't know the actual name), and the Lobster and Daikon Rolls served with rosemary ginger dip (not in photo but it was served). I didn't get the chance to eat nor did I really want to eat the lobster rolls because I'm afraid of getting an allergic reaction. But I did eat that show stopping one. Here's the photo...It's too purty to eat...It's really too expensive to eat in ways since you have probably $10 worth of edible gold (which is basically pure 23 or 24 carat gold that can be consumed) sitting on that thing. It's filled with cream cheese (give a creamy, slight tangy, pungent flavor), finely chopped mushrooms (mostly for texture since the cheese dominated the flavor), and caviar (that added salt and minute fish-like flavor). It's mind blowingly good. It's an explosion of bold flavors on the palate that makes you want to succumb to the creamy, salty, pungent-ness of this hors d'oeuvre.The next tray served a few minutes later served the Raw Tuna rolls. They tasted (and the waiter indicated) rosemary and ginger was in there, the tuna was of sushi quality, and the vegetables gave it a nice crunchy, refreshing texture. It's good but not as the previous one.Next up was the Prawn Satay.The shrimp was HUGE. I loved the crisp coating on that shrimp and it was cooked perfectly. This was the other favorite of the evening.The next tray that was sent down were the Crab Spring Rolls.I found that out after I ate it...but I was ok. No allergic reactions. Does that mean I could eat crustaceans now? Hmm... Anyways, these rolls were ok. It was crisp, fried, good ratio of crab meat in the filling but the flavors didn't tantalize my palate.So that's about it for the food portion of the evening. I wasn't really expecting a three course meal even though I wish it was going to happen. Then Martha Stewart and Jean Georges arrived around 7:55 for photo-ops and made their speeches.Martha in the center, Jean Georges on the right.Around 8 or so, they prepped for the show and started to broadcast. I felt kind of bad for Martha because of the fact that not many were sitting and watch them do the interview/show. They're just chatting and networking amongst themselves.Getting ready...They're on airI have to admit, I wasn't as polite as well since Ariel and I left early to Don's invite to a soft opening of the bar in the East Village named, Please Don't Tell, or known as PDT.The portion of the bar in front of me...Sam (the guy talking and sitting next to me) and John (the bartender)We took the chairs on the bar and were given the menu. After talking between us, Ariel decided to go for the Pimms Rangoon and I got the Trident.From Pour to Product: Ariel's Pimms Ragoon. For a larger photo of the drink, click here.Ariel is either amused at his drink or the staring at the cocktail menu behind it...My TridentDangerously amber glow...Ariel's drink was fruity and subtly sweet from the muddled fruit and it was a smooth drink; I didn't really taste the alcohol, nor did he.My drink on the other hand, looks dangerous; from the dark orange glow radiating from the drink, as well as the viscous look when you really look at the close-up photo well. I'm asking for trouble. After taking a sip, the first thing you taste was the punch of alcohol, then the licorice, anise flavor of the aquavit, and the finishing taste was a subtle hint of citrus fruit. It's a dry, strong, and bold drink. It's not exactly my type of drink but it's good. It's meant for the drinkers who love to have a really strong cocktail.When Will, our bartender for the evening, asked us if we wanted anything to eat (which comes from the kitchen of Crif Dogs) we each ordered a burger. But somehow the orders got mixed up a bit since no one claimed a plate of two cheeseburgers that has everything including onions. How can I not pass a burger that has onions when it's not on the menu? I said, \"I'll take it if no one wants it.\" We've now been bestowed upon a plate of glorious, greasy mess. Seriously, this burger looks like it could kill a hangover and give you a heart attack after having a couple of them. Also, there was an unclaimed Chihuahua dog that Ariel and I agreed to split, so we really don't die that night but inching our way there.Here's Will, holding the Luxardo Maraschino LiquorThe heart attack inducing burgersMy burger innardsThe Chihuahua dogThe burger's mighty tasty but it's fully cooked. It's a burger topped with American cheese, onions, tomato marmalade (I didn't taste ketchup) and lots of bacon-y goodness. All of that unctuous goodness is in a regular sesame seeded hamburger bun that is also soaking in all of that grease. It's yummy and I think, as I consumed this burger, my heart is pumping extra harder for the sake of more saturated fat and cholesterol is clogged in my arteries.The Chihuahua dog is basically a deep fried hot dog, wrapped in bacon, topped with avocado and sour cream. Oh, it's a doozy alright. It tastes awesome but jeez, I think I need to see a cardiologist.When we're about half-way finished with our food, Ariel asked me if I was drunk. I said not really, so he said order another drink. I thought he was drunk. But I did anyways since I don't go to a bar that often and I really didn't touch my Trident after that first sip. I ended up asking for the Pisco Sour just because of the egg white in the drink sounded interesting.The Pisco SourThe Pisco was smooth with a touch of an alcoholic bite. There was a finishing end of the sour-tart toward middle to aftertaste. The egg white gave it a creamy, thickness to the drink and I think it was executed well. It's quite good. After that drink, Ariel and I called it a night.My feedback in regards to the bar, it feels a bit exclusive and secretive (in terms of getting into the place). It's has a speakeasy feel and taxidermist decor, yet it's lively, very laid back and comfortable.Here's another photo of the bar.So this was my unconventional Wednesday night. It was fun, a ton of food, and booze. Heck, I think I haven't drink that much before in a long time, that isn't a holiday. Good thing my finals were over...And no, I didn't have a hangover. All of that greasy food actually neutralize the alcohol, as well as drinking a lot of water.If you'd like to see the slideshow of the photos taken of PDT Bar, click here, and here for the party.

Steamy Kitchen: Yay! for making you hungry? ;)
I really don't know what's on that shrimp. From what I remember tasting was a crisp, crunchy coating that is possibly coarse breadcrumbs with some seasonings that was sautéed with butter to a perfect golden brown. It's not like a complex flavor type of food, but it's cooked spot on and it has enough salt and seasonings that makes it memorable.May: THANK YOU for loving my blog. I don't know if this addiction would be a bad thing but thanks for reading. :) I never thought myself as Perez Hilton of food but if it works for you...Anonymous: I know it's called a Beggar's Purse in general, but I don't know what Vong would entitle this amazing little hors d'oeuvre, since the others I got were from their menu. But thanks for letting me know. :)

Dying for some food right now.  I enjoy how casual you are in writing when your pictures are so elegant.  I mean, you were at social events taking photos in \"snapshot-only\" moments (I think), and some of them look as if you spent hours working on lighting and composition.I read your FAQ -- it's clear others admire your photography as well since you needed to post your camera info.  So, well done!

Yes, the Martha Stewart event was a \"snapshot-only\" moment (so many people try to eat the food before I could take photos of them), I think I got a bit lucky with the lighting. My blog is mostly meant to be casual or at least approachable to everyone who loves and understands food.

Edible gold, wow. How did it taste actually? Papery? Goldy?  LOL.

Rasa Malaysia: Edible gold does not have any flavor whatsoever. It just melts in your mouth and that's the end of it. The purpose of edible is quite superfluous; it's just meant to look (and cost) luxurious without contributing anything to flavor or texture.

When an invitation like that comes along, you don't ask why, you just ask when! The food looked awesome, and nice pics of the proceedings!
And after your PDT bar report, I'm not only hungry, but thirsty...and it's  not even noon here on the left coast!!

I asked why since no major corporation has ever invited me to such an event but it's cool. I think you could hold off an hour or so for your drink... ;)

Peter: Wow...you just need that much time to hop across the other side of the globe to get here without jet lag, good for you!I'm sort of getting used to working in this office, since now I'm just a newbie. Food experience from where I work is extremely bleak and I'm not kidding, it's right off a shopping mall. And I don't like mall food, it's disgusting and so artificial.

Before I start talking about what happened last week, I want to say that I haven't been able to write anything for the past couple of days because of finals. Yes. The torment that all students of any age especially from high school on, feel the crush of stress and pressure to do well. I'm technically done, except I need to write a philosophy paper but I should be fine...I hope. Moving on.The most furthest I have ever been from the city happened on the week before my finals. I don't think that statement made any sense or relation to anything, but I went to Coney Island in Brooklyn.Hey, this ain't Manhattan...My friend Dave, took me to Coney Island since I told him I never went there before. Probably I have but it was when I was waaay to young to remember anything significant. Since this is Coney Island, we have to eat at Nathan's.Prices and signageEmployees working and chattingLocal dudes waiting to order and get their grubDave and I ordered their #1, which is their cheeseburger that comes with fries, and we had a hot dog. By the time we got the food, we chose to sit outside since the weather's pretty darn nice.The tables outsideAnd here's the food...(Note: I forgot to take a photo of the hot dog...it's consumed beforehand but it was awesomely good!).The burgerInnardsThe friesFry in ketchupThe burger was okay. It wasn't as good (or remotely good) as Shake Shack's burger. It's fully cooked (it's overcooked to me; it must be at most medium rare) and the vegetables were fresh but the burger lacked that salty crust that screams FLAVOR to my tongue. The fries were shaped differently than any other fry I ever come across in my life. It tasted fine; some were crisp and some were a bit soggy but it's passable.On Thursday, I went to Lassi in West Village.Why? Well, for the past week NY Magazine published the Sandwich of the Week from Lassi. So I thought to myself, \"Why not try it?\" I haven't been there before nor have I ever had an Indian sandwich before. Hence my presence there.Here's their menu board:The other half that was glared out...I ordered the aforementioned sandwich, called a paratha ($10.95) and a small mango lassi ($3.50).My mango lassiThe foodCurried/spiced pineapples served with parathaI know the paratha does not look like the one you see in NY Magazine. What Chef Heather Carlucci-Rodriguez told me that they thought of putting everything in a bowl to show all the elements that went into that paratha. So here's how it really looks like unraveled...don't worry, it's not gruesome or anything remotely like that.Paratha unwrappedParatha, in halfInnards, close upThe paratha was delicious. The dense, buttery, griddled bread enrobed the spicy, slow roasted Berkshire pork shoulder, with masala-spiced tomato, spicy mint chutney, and boondi raita. It was a mess to eat but it was pretty darn tasty. The mango lassi was a good, smooth, fruity beverage to cool down the heat of that paratha. In a very vague way, this paratha reminds me of Momofuku Ssäm's Original Ssäm but not as intensely pork flavored and filled, a heck of a lot more spicier (in a good way), and obviously it's a different cuisine.Addresses: Nathan's Famous 1310 Surf Avenue Brooklyn, NY 11224Lassi 28 Greenwich Avenue New York, NY 10011

Man, the one time I went to Lassi my food didn't look or taste as good as yours did!  :(  But I didn't get a pork filled paratha.  Maybe I need to give it another chance.

The pork filled paratha is a new item on their menu. You should give Lassi another try. I thought it was pretty good.

Hey Everyone! It seems like the reason why Grom's workers are leveling their gelato it's because they're INEXPERIENCED. It's not their business practice.Those of you who've read my issues with the gelato recently, said I would write an \"angry email.\" Well, I wrote a complaint and emailed to Italy about this problem. Here's the reply:Dear Tina, thank you for your kind email, and thank you for the compliments about gelato.And I personally apologize for what happened to you.I sincerely have to say that it is very complex to organize a new shop, far from Italy as the one in New York is, and to train all the Grom workers at the best. At same time is not easy to build the right team of “conisti” to serve the gelato.For this reason, our manager Luigi Ferraris is there in New York this week to explain to everybody how really serve and explain to our clients the characteristics of our gelato and raw materials.So I’d like to say to you that to level the gelato is not a question of Grom policy but just the inexperience of the guys who serve the gelato (is this the reason for which many of them use the tshirt “conista in training”): it will be my personal care to inform the managers of the shop of your comment, and I will do everything to solve the problem.Don’t hesitate to write me for any other observation.SincerelyGuido MartinettiGromart SrlSede Legale: P.za Paleocapa, 1/d - 10121 TorinoSede Amministrativa: Strada Cuorgnè, 51/4 - 10070 Mappano di Caselle (To)Tel. +39.0119961004 Fax +39.0119910411I guess it's safe to say that we can go back to Grom and eat gelato there before I'll vent again. I miss Grom's gelato...

Look at you! Nice work! I was just going to respond to your first chowhound post, saying they hadn't quite leveled mine, although let's talk about those cup sizes. TINY! Next, will you complain about those?
Here's my review-

Nosher reports that they were still leveling (half?) their cup gelatoes. I guess we're halfway there?I definitely want to give Grom all the benefit of the doubt as they seem like great people who make a great product, but really, is it that hard to instruct your employees to not level the cups if indeed that is not their policy?We're not splitting atoms here, we're scooping ice cream into cups, and unless their servers are borderline mental, I'm sure a \"hey, don't forget to not level the cups, we've had some complaints\" at the morning meeting will suffice.
thewanderingeater
2007-05-20 10:39:00
John: I just read Nosher's report this morning.I hope there's more progress. It is a bit too absurd to tell the employees to skip the scraping/leveling of the gelato. If anything, I'll complain again when I'm going there this week during one of my lunch breaks, if I witness this again.

Finally...I Ate Their Sliders

***CONTENT
If anything besides macarons, my recent obsession for the past few months is to get my hands on Bouchon Bakery's cute, petite Wagyu beef sliders that Ed Levine and Robyn had. The only thing that killed me is that they don't serve them everyday and most of the time whenever I ask the host about their sliders, it's not served that day. That is until now.This is the first time I ever eaten from Bouchon's Bakery's café/restaurant. All of the previous posts that I've written about Bouchon were only from their take-out. After I've been seated and perused the menu, I already know that I want sliders since almost everything else on their menu sans the soups and salads, I've had from their take-out (in case you didn't know). It took an awful long time to actually order my food (I waited 5 minutes that seemed like 10) since my server's been busy with other patrons. Just to kill some time, I just took photos of random things of this place.Diners beside meAn eyesore of a signDiners at the communal tableWhen he finally arrived, I've ordered the sliders ($15.75) and dessert ($9.25). I was contemplating between the tiramisu and the rhubarb tart and asked him which is preferred. He replied the rhubarb tart but also persuading me to get the tiramisu by explaining that this is a deconstructed version of the original tiramisu. He said that if I don't like it, he'll be willing to replace it with the rhubarb tart. So I went for the tiramisu and take it from there.Within 10 minutes, the water was served as well as the sliders (not together but within that time frame).Sliders!When my plate of sliders was laid before me, I let it bask in it's photogenic glory for five minutes. Then it's time to eat.Probably I should tell you what's in these sliders. They're made of Wagyu beef, topped with Taleggio cheese, tomato marmalade, and a schmear of garlic aïoli all on top of a in-house made brioche buns topped with some flecks of fleur de sel. Yep, it's some haute mini burgers. I really love the silky richness of the Wagyu beef, the slightly pungent garlic mayo, and the creamy Taleggio cheese. But even though they're a whole different level compared to other burgers, I still prefer Shake Shack's burger probably due to the salt that encrusts their burger. But I still like Bouchon's sliders.Obviously, whenever I eat out I must have dessert. So here's the Tiramisu.Spooned...It looks so darn pretty and tasty, doesn't it? Even though it does, it didn't make me happy. Somehow eating having that spooned tiramisu pictured above, the coffee ganache was too bitter that made it a bit unpalatable for my taste. I told my server that I didn't like it too much and he did kindly replaced this dessert for the rhubarb tart.Served viewReversed (more photogenic, in my opinion) viewInnardsI love the flavor combination of strawberries and rhubarb, just because it reminds me of spring. I don't know. I'm just an odd person who affiliates some food flavors and textures according to the seasons. This tart was delicious. The soft, tart rhubarb meets sweet strawberries contrasted with the nutty, almond streusel that topped the tart. The crème fraîche ice cream that is served on the side melded with all the flavors wonderfully. If I wasn't so self-conscious, I would have picked up the plate and lick it since it was so good. But obviously, I didn't.As my first time on the café/restaurant side of Bouchon, I thought the service was spotty but the server did comply to my whims in terms of food and drink. The food is obviously very good and you know the atmosphere's like from the photos. Just try those sliders; it's tasty and it's unlike any other burger you'll ever eat.Address: Bouchon Bakery 10 Columbus Circle, 3rd Floor New York, NY 10019

Everything Eaten before the Kyotofu Dinner...and other stuff

I know I should have posted everything I've eaten on Thursday in one LONG post but I wasn't motivated since I had to write journals for one of my classes that ended up to be twenty pages long. My brain dried up of any use of any prose, hence my lack of writing for that portion of the day and just write about the Kyotofu dinner.On Thursday morning, I wanted a latte just because I was terribly disgruntled with what happened on Tuesday. So, I went back to my first (coffee) love, Joe on Waverly Place, in the West Village.It's been ages since I've visited this place but it hasn't changed much. The casual, laid back vibe is still there, with a few baristas that I'm familiar with, and lots of the local residents waiting for their brew. It's like visiting an old friend that you've haven't seen in a long time.As I've said earlier, I wanted a small latte ($3.50 plus tax) and that's what I've gotten.It seems that ever since I went to Ninth Street Espresso on E 13th Street, lattes were never the same again. Every single latte I've drank ever since Ninth have been milky. Even Joe's. Granted that Joe's latte was much better than Roasting Plant, but it's not the same.Around 11 AM, I had every intention of going to Blue Ribbon Bakery to get myself a loaf addictive bread allegedly filled with crack, that's according to Robyn. The problem is that I didn't look up their hours on their site that they're opened at noon. Being disappointed, I realized that Chocolate Haven is nearby and I walked my way down to King Street. Chocolate makes everything better in the world.I know I've went to CH last week, but I'm really determined to get my hands on a macaron that Robyn had helped making and eaten there. My thoughts have been answered, they have the macarons! Unfortunately, chocolate is the only flavor but at least it's something.The chocolate macaron was actually pretty good but it's chewier than I would like in a macaron. It's just enough chocolate flavor but not as pronounced or as decadent as La Maison du Chocolat's Quito macaron. I have to admit though, for $1.25 that macaron it's pretty damn good.Since it's a humid, sweltering day, I ended up getting myself an iced mocha ($4).It's good and cold. The main two words that I needed for that day. The mocha's texture was a lot better than the iced hot chocolate since there's no graininess of chocolate and the fact that the dark, robust coffee flavor helped the fact that I need caffeine since I didn't get my morning coffee.Anyways, I also splurged on a chocolate bar: the Coffee Break ($4.50). Hmmm...there's an unintentional coffee theme going on.UnwrappedInnardsEven though I don't love milk chocolate that much, I still appreciate chocolate in all its delicious variations. The Coffee Break bar was quite good. It had a nice caramel flavor from the milk chocolate with tones of coffee flavor that doesn't taste bitter. It's good but I might as well go for a Valhrona's Le Noir Extra Amer 85% bar for a slightly similar price tag.This is a bit of a side note, but I've never really eaten JT's croissants before even though I've been here a hundred times.For the remaining portion of the day, I've tried to walk off my caffeinated, sugary binge in Central Park's Shakespeare Garden and Belvedere Castle.Staircase to Shakespeare GardenCityscape view from Belvedere CastleTower of Belvedere CastleSpending an hour or so there, I walked over to Grom's for more gelato. I'm officially addicted to Grom. I think they need to start a GA (Gromoholics Anonymous) program. I'll be like, \"Hi, my name's Tina and I'm a Grom gelato addict.\" Anyways, I ordered a medium cup of pistachio and extra noir chocolate.It's melting...Do you see a problem with these photos? If you nod or said, \"Yes.\" You're correct. A new relatively new employee who was working on the gelato scooped the gelato in blobs but leveled it out. This is heresy I tell you! Heresy! I don't (nor do you) expect to pay $6.15 for a leveled out cup of gelato. It's unnatural. I think I need to cry for a moment...[sobs]The gelato still tasted good. The pistachio is still awesome; the extra noir chocolate has the complex character of Valhrona chocolate. Next time, if that guy does that again I will inflict verbal abuse to him.For the coming week, I won't be eating out that much since it's the last week of classes and finals are looming on the following Monday. The only plan of sorts is that on Wednesday, May 23rd, which is two days after my finals are over (thankfully), I'll be in the Financial District checking out Dine Around Downtown. Yep, I'm lunching with a bunch of financial bankers and corporate people. Actually, it's not too different than what I do in Midtown.Addresses: Joe 141 Waverly Pl New York, NY 10014Jacques Torres Chocolate Haven 350 Hudson Street New York, NY 10014Grom 2165 Broadway New York, NY 10024

I can't believe they leveled your gelato!! RIDICULOUS!!Ive had a Torres bar or two, but I don't really like them for some reason. They melt kind of  . . grain-ily?
thewanderingeater

Susannah: It's ridiculous, absurd, cruel, you name it...it's just plain WRONG for what he did to my gelato. I would seriously give him a piece of my mind if I ever encounter him again.The Torres bar was ok. The flavors were fine. I did find them a bit grainy but their bars are not meant to be melted, only eaten. You should have gotten the bulk bags instead. I baked and melted them before and those worked perfectly fine.

I went to Grom today, and they're all leveling out the cups.  Must be the new standard.  Here's a secret: you get more if you order a cone (because they can't level those out).  The servers are really slow, I might add.  I takes them several minutes to scoop.  That's why the line is so long!
thewanderingeater
2007-05-14 05:59:00
Jessica: WUH?! They're leveling out all the cups? WTF?! Probably I should have eaten all of Grom's gelato the first day I went there instead, where it fluffy mounds were served. This is a major disappointment...

If they're leveling out the cups, then I aint going. Sure it's good, but for the prices they charge, I expect a HEAPING of gelato.Their prices, combined with all the blogosphere attention they've been getting, and the fact that they're leveling out cups now just makes them seem cheap and trying to increase their profit margin. Really classless.

John: I agree with you that one would expect a heaping mound of gelato in a cup. I'm seriously thinking about sending an angry email about that...

you should send them an email and give them a piece of your mind. this gives them feedback that foodies and bloggers are not amused.    now i don't want to go either, even if their gelato is good - it's the principle of it.btw, i just talked to an italian  friend who grew up in italy and she's never heard of grom !   i was gonna drag her up there to taste and tell me if it's all that, now i'm not going until they reverse their tacky leveling.

2007-05-16 18:10:00
Jo Jo (aka eat2love): I did send them an email. I haven't been to Grom ever since and you have no idea how much it kills me that I would like to get some gelato in this sweltering weather we're having in NYC these days.
I'm sorry that your Italian friend won't be able to go to Grom due to your (or should I say, \"our?\") rebellion to leveling the gelato. Probably, they'll reinstate the lovely scoops soon. Hopefully.

Is levelling not done at Grom's or gelato places in general?  I just ask because I've been to several gelato places (not in NY, but in other places) and all of them level their gelato.  So just curious!

A Night of Kyotofu with a Tofu Skeptic

***CONTENT
On Thursday evening, I had dinner with a foodie friend of mine, Ariel, who doesn't like tofu at all. He considers tofu as food from \"the dark side.\" I told him tofu isn't disgusting at all, he just had awful tofu from various eating establishments. So in ways for me to force encourage him to like tofu, I ended up making a deal with him that I'll pay for dinner at Kyotofu.I've told my dilemma with one of the co-owners of Kyotofu, Nicole and after several conversations, we've agreed to a menu for the evening in hopes to convert a tofu skeptic. Here's the evening's menu:Savories:Chicken and Tofu TsukuneOnigiriDesserts:Original Sweet TofuSancho Pepper Tofu Cheesecake, Tahitian Vanilla Parfait, and Mini Miso Chocolate Cake on the Prix FixeWarm Chocolate Raspberry Mochi CakeChocolate Okara Cupcake (to take home)I just left it a surprise of sorts for Ariel to find out for the evening. I know it's a bit devious of me to do that but I trust my instincts with this place, the chef, Ritsuko Yamaguchi, as well as Nicole's knowledge of the menu.Here's the actual menu for the month of May, for the curious.On to the food...(just be warned that the food photos are going to be generally grainy due to the dim lighting)The first course of the evening, the chicken and tofu tsukune meatballs, was generally good. The meatball was a bit dry for my liking but I did enjoy the refreshing flavors of the crisp cucumber and the minty shiso herb.The onigiri, which were warm Japanese rice balls, were something memorable to eat since it had a slightly unusual flavors. One of them was flavored with purple shiso (on the left side of the photo) and the other is brown rice mixed with red aduzki beans. The latter rice ball seemed to appeal Ariel since he affiliates this with Middle Eastern cuisine. In ways, I can understand his perception since beans are common in Middle Eastern food. He also liked the tsukemono (pickled vegetables), especially the takuwan (pickled daikon).Then came the desserts. We started off with a tasting portion of the Original Sweet Tofu.It's creamy, custardy goodness topped with the kuromitsu black sugar sauce.Ariel's argument was that it's practically a knock-off of flan. We've debated about this subject for a while but at least he liked the tofu. He was surprised that it tasted good and it was creamy.For the real dessert course, the prix fixe plate. For those of you who have been following my blog for a while are a bit familiar with this plate. The only difference is that in exchange for the Japanese Okyau rice pudding, we had the Sancho Pepper Cheesecake instead.The plateTo those of you who recalled my previous visit, the decadent Miso Choco Cake and the insanely rich vanilla parfait are particular favorites of mine.The Sancho Pepper Cheesecake was quite interesting, since I never had it before. This thick, rich slice of cake delicately flavored with the lemony, peppery flavor of the sancho pepper (which is also known as the Szechuan peppercorn). It's layered on top of a thin, sesame cake absorbing the spicy sweet heat of the plum's carpaccio's marinade. The only drawback was that I didn't taste any plum flavor from the fruit itself.After the plates were cleared, the Warm Chocolate Raspberry Mochi Cake with a small hemisphere of blackberry-pomegranate yokan was served. At this particular time, Ariel was in the mood for some booze, requesting the drink menu. Here's the drink menu and the man himself.Ariel perusing the menuSeasonal drinksShochu CocktailsHe kindly offered to buy me a drink since I'm paying for the food. Since the sake menu lacked descriptions, we just went for a cocktail. He opted for a Tropical Rokku and I ordered a Harujuku Martini.Ariel said his drink was not too sweet and it's smooth; he liked it.My drink was a bit too pulpy for my taste but it was good. It had just enough sweetness, nice balance of the sweet lychee and tart apple. The cocktail was not as potent as the \"Coming Up Roses\" from the Modern's Bar Room; this martini just gave me a buzz, thankfully.After a few sips of our own cocktails, we ate the cake that was brought in earlier.Close up of the cakeClose up of the yokanThe chocolate cake was still warm and gooey by the time we actually ate it. He loved the cake and the yokan was something new and unusual for him since he never had it before. His analogy for the yokan would be similar to Jell-O but more thicker.Then we were served our own plate of Okara cookies...and were presented with the NY Magazine accoladed, Chocolate Soufflé cupcake to take home; it's on Nicole. (There'll be better photos of the cupcake in a few moments...)CupcakeWhen the check was brought over, they also gave us a small dish of cassis jelly cubes.After we paid, we chatted briefly with the co-owners and bid farewell. When it comes to the fate of my chocolate cupcake, it didn't last too long since I ate it yesterday for lunch. I don't really have to tell you that it was awesome...you can just tell by the photos.Cupcake in halfInnardsTo answer Nicole's (one of Kyotofu's co-owners) question and my own little mission, did Ariel become a tofu convert? Well, after talking to him for a while after that evening's dinner, he did enjoyed the food and the atmosphere (which reminded him of being in a futuristic spaceship of sorts) but it didn't necessarily made him a total tofu convert. His argument was that he wanted a control group of dairy based desserts with the experimental (Kyotofu's desserts) and make a better judgment from there. At least he thinks tofu are now in \"the twilight zone.\" Those were his words, not mine.Edited (5/13/07): After recently IMing Ariel, he thought, \"The place was marvellous\" and the chocolate cupcake was \"delicious.\" So there you have it, we have a semi-tofu convert or at least a Kyotofu convert.Address: Kyotofu 705 9th Avenue New York, NY 10019

Funny... I think dairy as a control group for tofu is a totally wrongheaded way of evaluating tofu... I'd rather consider them in isolation, because I don't think I could say \"I prefer this to that\" unless the tofu is just past its prime.For Japanese, and in everyday thinking in most of the rest of Asia, tofu isn't a meat or dairy substitute... sometimes they even go together.
thewanderingeater
2007-05-26 20:44:00
Jason: Before I reply to your argument, my friend just likes sweet tofu after this meal.I understand the Asian philosophy of tofu going together with meat or dairy, since I am Chinese and my parents usually make dishes involving with those ingredients.For my friend's thought of comparing the desserts, it works in ways since they can be of the made of dairy. He's not exposed to good tofu, only mediocre ones.

This morning I went to the Lower East Side for the sake of a recent opening and in hopes of a good latte. It's been ages since I've put my lips on a good latte or even a cup of superb coffee, so I went back to the Roasting Plant.I ordered this time a medium latte ($3.50) since I wanted to know if their latte is good as their espresso or regular brew.Whole Milk Latte (medium)As you can see from the above photo, it's a bust. The latte was too diluted with milk. It lacked the crema and the robust espresso flavor. I was disappointed but at least I know now that for a good cup of latte, just go to Ninth Street Espresso but Roasting Plant do have really great drip and espresso.After a while walking around and getting lost in the Lower East Side for twenty minutes (I'm not too familiar with the geography down there), I finally found Cocoa Bar.After staring at their drink menu for 5 minutes and contemplating what the heck I want to eat, I ended up ordering their Port Soaked Fig ($4.50), a Chocolate Cloud Cookie ($2), and a small dark hot chocolate ($3.75). Yeah, I'm stuffing myself with chocolate...Dark Hot ChocolateThe foodThe hot chocolate was well...milky. The chocolate flavor was practically muted out since there was so much milk.But at least the food or snacks, technically, fared so much better. The Chocolate Cloud Cookie reminds me of an ultra light version of a fudgey brownie, if that ever existed. It had a thin, crisp crust with a fudgey, light center. It's rich, decadent yet light in texture. I love this cookie. It's a close version to Jacques Torres' Mudslide Cookie without the chocolate overkill. I need a better comparison.Chocolate Cloud CookieInnardsI bought the Port Soaked Fig just because I love figs. What isn't there I don't like? Hmm...I need to think that one out but back to the fig. The fig has infused with enough port wine that it sweetens yet gives it an winy, alcoholic bite. Don't worry it won't make you drunk. I have a low tolerance for alcohol anyways. The thin dark chocolate covering and the chocolate ganache (about 72% cocoa) that filled the center of the fig gives it a bittersweet contrast to the sweetness imparted to the fig and port. Even though it is pricey for its size but it's worth it. I could make it at home but acquiring a bottle of port is pricey too. I'll figure it out.Bitten; I know it's a bit gruesomeSo it's a day of mediocre beverages but good snacks or I should say desserts, even though I ate this at 11 AM. I'll consider it dessert before lunch since my real lunch wasn't really worth blogging about.Addresses: Roasting Bean 81 Orchard Street New York, NY 10002Cocoa Bar 21 Clinton Street New York, NY 10002

Hello!
I randomly came across your website and absolutely LOVE it.
The vibrant pictures and mouth watering descriptions of food add a whole other meaning to eating.  I look foward to future posts.  You have a new stalker, now.

tina - one of my fave ports is  quinta da noval get their LBV which stands for late bottle harvest .  this is a sweet port which is a mere $13. (had great ranking in wine magazine a few years ago)  i  did a vertical tasting of quinta da noval ports from no vintage, LBV, vintage, to 10 year, 20 year, 40 year which costs way more, but my fave is still the LBV . and it's perfect for soaking figs yumm sluuurp.......
i'd soak cherries in it too. double sluurp yumm.

I'll get a bottle whenever I'm dying for some port and figs. This is going to be dangerous for me...Doug: No, I haven't tried Bacio. Actually, I need to explore the UES more often...that's if I'm ever motivated to travel up there.No, I'm not finished with school yet.

Or maybe you can get some coffee beans by mail order and grind them yourself...?Lara: I wanted to try out their night scene since their day manager spoken to me when I went there. She strongly suggested that I should try their blueberry mojito when I go there. Wuh? No figs?! That's just cruel...you must go back for them. It's soo good.

If you think a particular cafe's latte is too milky, go for a cappuccino or a machiatto. A latte, by definition, is  milky. A cappuccino has less milk. A machiatto is an espresso with just a dollop of foam, and is highly recommended if you like espresso. The diluted latte is NOT the drink for coffee-lovers. And Starbucks' is the worst -- from  the bad, overroasted coffee to the outrageously high proportion of milk in their venti latte AND cappuccino.

Grom opened the past Saturday. Due to the extensive press coverage from The NY Times, NY Magazine, amongst the plethora, it's too tempting for me to pass up anything related to gelato. My mind is screaming, \"Why aren't you eating there yet?!\" So I finally went there today. Get ready for a creamy, sugar rush...because I did.I arrived there at 12:45 PM and they already have a line!Grom with a line of peopleThe WallPrice & Flavor ListMost of these people are high schoolers, stroller moms, and a few shoppers who were in the neighborhood. I'm there for two reasons, one is the obvious (I want gelato) and the other was that I had an interview for a possible summer job/internship. Anyways, the line moved fairly quickly and lots of pedestrians who pass by inquired, \"What's this line for? Is it worth $5 for a small?\" I wondered the same when I read this from various articles. I'm hoping I'll be down on my knees, weeping with elated joy for that kind of price tag.Scooping gelatoBy the time I'm on the front, I've ordered a medium cup of gelato filled with pistachio and stracciatella. The price: $5.75, including tax, it's $6.15. I kind of winced at that point of paying that much for a medium that looks like a small.Pistachio and Stracciatella gelatos in a mediumWell, I got to admit it's worth spending for. The pistachio is SOO GOOD! The pistachio flavor tasted so fresh with a concentrated roasted pistachio flavor. Not at all artificial. It's smooth, not cloyingly sweet, über creamy, and dense.Look at that lovely texture...The stracciatella, which is basically a combination of a sweet cream gelato mixed in with Valhrona chocolate chunks, is good but I wasn't as happy as the pistachio. I should have thought it out a bit more on the flavor combo.For some crazy, insane reason I went back on line and actually got myself another cup of gelato. Yup, I'm a gelato maniac and I didn't even get to eat a real lunch either. I have issues...Anyways, for my second round I got a small cup with gianduja (hazelnut and chocolate flavor) and Luna Rossa ($4.75, plus tax).Dripping...The gianduja is really intensely flavored with roasted hazelnuts and chocolate. The texture is still creamy, dreamy, and decadent. Gah, I want more! The Luna Rossa was a delicate gelato that is made of sweet cream and flavored with raspberries. Posso avere alcuni più? (Can I have more?, in Italian)I officially love Grom for all their gelato goodness or should I say gelato heaven? I just hope that if I do get the job that I've just been interviewed, could resist the temptation of getting a cup or cone of gelato every single day as long as I work there before I'll certainly gain weight and drain out my paycheck.Address: Grom 2165 Broadway New York, NY 10024

SteamyKitchen: Yeah, it's expensive but it tastes like it's worth the splurge. This is obviously not meant for daily consumption before I go for broke and clog my arteries more than I need to already.Robyn: Pistachio... I'm still dreaming of it. Well, it's hard to tell what is a small and a medium at first glance but as you dig in, you do get an ounce or so more of gelato from small to medium.miss tiffie: Yay! :)  Gelato is awesome stuff.

Hey hey, I haven't tried any of the hyped up gelatos before [ah, rural life] but I hear really good things about Capigiro- there flavors sound delicious. Check em out online!  You can order them there, as well- but I think it needs to be something like 6 flavors per order...no matter, get a group of friends to chip in!

I am very well aware most of you are still visiting my site for updates...and well, you know I'm not doing it that often. I apologize for not doing much just because I'm working (as I hope most of you know) and the area where I'm working at lacks any good food that doesn't warrant my efforts on posting. So, there's my reasons for not updating so often. I'm sorry and I thank you for my fans out there who still check on my site constantly. Did I mention I love you for doing that? If I haven't, I LOVE you!Onto the food...as I've mentioned earlier, I don't eat out that much which means, I'm baking/cooking more often. So, I ended up baking a batch of walnut brownies from on Ina Garten's Outrageous Brownies. And boy, aren't they awesome...Then I also baked a batch of whole wheat blueberry muffins that is based on my grapefruit cranberry muffin recipe but sans the vanilla sugar and the grapefruit zest and obviously, the use of fresh blueberries. The changes I've done to this recipe is that I've used one cup of whole wheat flour and one cup of unbleached all purpose flour (which still equates to 2 cups of flour) and then add an extra four tablespoons of milk from the original recipe. The latter addition resulted to a more moist, delicate crumb. It's delicious, a tad bit healthier than your typical blueberry muffin, and it's a nice pastry to start your morning.Bitten muffinHere's the muffin recipe, in case you are confused what the heck I was saying earlier with the alterations...Whole Wheat Blueberry Muffins Makes 1 dozenIngredients: 1 stick (1/2 cup) unsalted butter, room temperature, plus tablespoon or so for greasing pan 1 cup all-purpose flour 1 cup whole wheat flour 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder 1/2 teaspoon salt 2 cups fresh blueberries (it's summer; so it's plentiful out there) 1 cup sugar 2 large eggs 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract 1/2 cup + 4 tablespoons milk 1/4 cup granulated sugar (you can either purchase this or make your own)Directions:1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit. Generously butter a standard 12-cup muffin pan and add in a tablespoon of sugar in each muffin cup, tapping out excess; set aside. In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, and salt.2. In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, or using a handheld mixer, beat butter and the sugar on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add eggs, one at a time, beating until combined. Mix in vanilla.3. With the mixer on low speed, add reserved flour mixture, beating until just combined. Add milk, beating until just combined. Do not overmix. Using a rubber spatula, fold in the blueberries. Divide batter evenly among the prepared muffin cups. Sprinkle the remaining sugar on top of muffin batter.4. Bake, rotating pan halfway though, until muffins are golden brown and a cake tester inserted in the center of one muffin comes out clean, about 30 minutes. Transfer pan to a wire rack to cool 10 minutes. Turn muffins on their sides in their cups, and let cool. Serve warm or at room temperature.

I want to apologize for not writing in a looong time. I've been stressed with work at the office I'm working at and my Internet connection was down for the past two and a half days. Both are long stories that I would like to spare you from reading.Okee...moving on. Last Friday, I went to Takashimaya, a Japanese owned, gorgeous, luxurious boutique store on Fifth Avenue (and yes, I know their site is in Japanese). I go there just because of their tea shop in their basement, not the other stuff.Anyhow, since it's past 3 PM they were serving tea. After being seated in the small, earth-toned café, I perused their tea menu. The usual suspects for tea are there: pastries, tea sandwiches and cookies, along with their well known teas. I ended up ordering their \"East-West Afternoon Tea\" ($18) and I asked the waitress for a recommendation of what tea would go along with this set (the tea is included). Since I told her I wasn't feeling for green tea (I've been drinking it for ages at home), she recommended me the Takashimaya Rose black tea, and that's what I've ordered.Cup of rose teaThe tea was very delicious. The tea has a very sweet, rose flavor that I thought there was sugar in that tea but there isn't due to the nature of the roses contained in that tea. It's very lovely. About five minutes later, my bento box of sweets and tea sandwiches arrived. I don't have a photo of the entire thing because I only have my newly acquired macro lens with me that day. Much apologies on your part but at least I have the individual photos of each food item in that box.Root chipsRoasted peanutsThe tea sandwiches served in this bento (as well as a la carte) are the cucumber on pressed rice, salmon on pressed rice, chicken with wasabi mayonnaise on Japanese white bread, and a vegetarian spring roll in rice paper. The most intriguing to look at is the cucumber on pressed rice but the one with the best tasting was the chicken with the spicy, pungent, wasabi mayonnaise.Tea sandwichesAnother view of the sandwichesIf I had the patience to make something look like that...The sweets were fine in general. None really struck a chord on me that made me say, \"This dessert is awesome!\" It's more like, \"Hmm...this isn't bad but it's not spectacular either.\" If I had to choose a favorite of what's presented before me, I would say the smooth, creamy, caramel panna cotta. I don't think it's on their a la carte menu, as I'm looking at the copy they let me keep... The cheesecake they serve is not the cheesecake that us Americans think. It's more cake-like than the dense, creamy, artery-clogging dessert that we normally associate as cheesecake; you'll see as you look at the photos.Bowl of fruit (yay...cape gooseberry)Yuzu Citrus CheesecakePanna cottaChocolate dipped dried pearChocolate dipped candied gingerOne of the cookies that was served was a large, sugar crystal encrusted, puff pastry cookie that made me feel mesmerized and started to have fun with my macro...hence the multiple photos, as you'll see. It's buttery, not very sweet despite the fact that it's sugar coating the entire side of the cookie and it's deceptively light in texture.Sugary, puff pastry cookieThe layers...Macro of the sugary surface of the cookieAfter eating and paying my check, I walked over to Minamoto Kitchoan in hopes of their seasonal peach jelly and sherbets; the hopes were finally no longer dashed like it had been for the past few weeks.My order of jellies and sherbetsAs I open my hakuto jelly, I came across this instruction/description card...eh, I wish I could read Japanese. Unfortunately, I never took a Japanese language course in my life. If anyone could translate this for me, I will be grateful. But at least the illustrations helped.Jellies and sherbets unmoldedWhite peach sherbetLeft to Right: Pione sherbet and Muscat sherbetHakuto jellyAll of them are my favorites for the summer. The peach jelly and sherbet has a delicate, slightly floral peach flavor, and it's not your ordinary jelly; it's more smoother than the Jell-O. The sherbets are different because it's jelly at room temperature, as you've seen for the muscat. In frozen form, it has a bit of the jelly texture as you bite into it. It's delicious and flavorful and it definitely doesn't taste like medicine.Addresses: Takashimaya Tea Box 693 5th Avenue New York, NY 10022Minamoto Kitchoan 608 5th Avenue New York, NY 10020

re: japanese instructions/descriptionsthe illustrations on the right just say that you can either cut it up on a plate or eat it from its container. in the latter case, please use a spoon.and the stuff on the left are just things that you'd normally find on a japanese food item.. assurances etc. i'll just do a quick summary:
1. please be careful when pulling back the cover as this jelly contains real fruit juice which may spill.
2. spots observed in this product is a result of the ingredients used (i.e. fruits) and does not indicate spoilage of the product.
3. a return policy; if there are any problems, just return the product and they will replace it with a new one.

Tea Box Update:  Still a great price at $18.  My friend and I went there today instead of Gordon Ramsey's Maze. We didn't get the sugary puff pastry.  You can buy them right outside of the \"restaurant\".  I think they're about $10/bag.  Since they forgot my rice paper roll, I traded my salmon sandwich with my friend for his roll.  He was pleasantly surprised that such a small portion bento box would make him full.  We thoroughly enjoyed our afternoon tea together.  I had told him about the duck confit that you had for lunch, so we're definitely coming back here for lunch as well as tea again.  Those root chips reminded me of Terra chips, do you think they could have opened a bag and grabbed some of the chips to serve us?  =) Keep on writing, tasting, and shooting those fabulous photos.  We thoroughly enjoy reading your comments and seeing your photos.

Breakfast for Dad...

***CONTENT
Last week, technically last Friday, was my dad's birthday. I was a bit belated in celebrating his birthday since I was working that day and all I said to him was, \"Happy Birthday.\" What I did to make up for the lack of presents or anything to commemorate the day of his birth was to bake for breakfast. Yep, he loves bread and sweets as much as I do except he doesn't love chocolate like my mom does.Anyways, I ending up baking a batch of vanilla sugar encrusted, grapefruit-cranberry muffins and about two dozens of my interpretation of the traditional mantou. To my readers who are bakers, the recipe for the muffins will be at the end of the post.Cranberry confetti on the batter; yellow hue from the zest sitting in the milkPlate o' muffins for dad...InnardsBasically this muffin had a wonderful aroma of vanilla and floral citrus of the grapefruit. The cranberries gave the muffins a nice tartness to the muffin.What I did for the mantous was using my 7-month old sourdough starter (thankfully it's still living), sweeten it up with sugar and add an extra teaspoon of yeast to make sure the dough would rise and then let it have its first proof. Shape it like it was a cinnamon roll but fill it with granulated sugar, sweetened flaked coconut, and dessicated coconut. Proof it again overnight. Steam for 20 minutes and it's ready to eat.I don't have a photo for the final product due to the fact that it wasn't as photogenic as my muffins and my family consumed it once it came out of the steamer. I guess this is arguably a tribute for Father's Day (Happy Father's Day to all the dads who are reading this!)...but obviously I'm not repeating myself.Here's the recipe for the muffins.Vanilla-Sugar Crusted Grapefruit-Cranberry Muffins Makes 1 dozenIngredients: 1 stick (1/2 cup) unsalted butter, room temperature, plus tablespoon or so for greasing pan 2 cups all-purpose flour 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder 1/2 teaspoon salt 2 cups cranberries (I froze mine before since it was leftovers from a previous recipe) 1 cup sugar 2 large eggs 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract 1/2 cup milk Zest of a large grapefruit (approximately 1 1/2 tablespoons of grapefruit zest) 1/4 cup vanilla sugar (you can either purchase this or make your own)Directions:1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit. Generously butter a standard 12-cup muffin pan and add in a tablespoon of vanilla sugar in each muffin cup, tapping out excess; set aside. In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, and salt.2. In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, or using a handheld mixer, beat butter and the sugar on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add eggs, one at a time, beating until combined. Mix in vanilla.3. With the mixer on low speed, add reserved flour mixture, beating until just combined. Add milk, beating until just combined. Do not overmix. Using a rubber spatula, fold in the cranberries. Divide batter evenly among the prepared muffin cups. Sprinkle the remaining vanilla sugar on top of muffin batter.4. Bake, rotating pan halfway though, until muffins are golden brown and a cake tester inserted in the center of one muffin comes out clean, about 30 minutes. Transfer pan to a wire rack to cool 10 minutes. Turn muffins on their sides in their cups, and let cool. Serve warm or at room temperature.

Hi Tina,I think it is really sweet of you to bake for your Dad for his birthday day/Father's Day. Reading your entry gave me a much needed dosage of guilt that will hopefully jumpstart my own Father's Day efforts.
  On a more general note, I love reading your site and all the photos. Although I have only recently discovered it, i have read through all of your archived entries. I think you have an inspiring outlook on food and life. Your site is my go-to when I am having a stressful day at work.Keep up the good work!

I didn't really mean to make you (or anyone) feel a bit guilty for getting or doing something for Father's Day. But I hope both your father and yourself had a good one yesterday.

I made the muffins this morning, sans vanilla sugar.  They were so great that I think I'll make em again this weekend.  I just need to go grab some vanilla beans.Previously, i had only made muffins with dried cranberries.  They simply can't hold a candle to these.And the muffins go great with a half of grapefruit for breakfast :)

Doug: Aww...I think your daughters or even sons (there's nothing wrong with a boy cooking, ya know) would take of you when you get to that age. Just let them get inspired to cook when they're little.Ben: Yay! Someone tried the recipe...and it's successful! You've made my day. :)Muffins with dried cranberries are not that great. The texture's entirely different for the muffins.

Gray's Papaya, Yolato, and Kee's Chocolates' Macarons

I recently visited the city for lunch with my friend Dave. We ate lunch, or least I did when we stopped by to Gray's Papaya for their hot dog...or is it a frankfurter?InteriorHonestly, it's my first time eating there...despite the fact I've passed this place hundreds of times. I ended up ordering a hot dog with a little bit of onions ($1.25).It's not bad for something that is a bit over a buck. It's griddled nicely with a bit of a snap and the onions are a bit sweet. It's tasty but I liked Nathan's more.We then walked over to Yolato for trying out their healthier spin of gelato, as you can tell by it's name, it's yogurt in gelato form.Some of their gelato...Other Gelatos and SorbetsAfter staring at the fluffy mounds of gelato...or is it yolato(?) about five minutes, I asked for a sample of their pistachio. Not surprisingly, it's not as good as my beloved (but expensive) Grom but it's not awful either. Eventually I ended up ordering the craziest concoction I ever read, crêpe with gelato.Blobs of coconut gelatoInnardsIt's very decadent to say the least. It's a plain crêpe, made to order, filled with Nutella, dusted with powdered sugar and drizzled with chocolate syrup. The added fat and creamy goodness was obviously the two blobs of coconut gelato (coconutty with coconut flakes mixed in it = yums) that I wanted on top. The crêpe portion was fine but not extraordinary to note.Dave ordered a crêpe that's filled with chocolate chunks, instead of the Nutella. Looks very similar to mine sans the gelato but he's fine with what he had.Then we walked down to SoHo to Kee's Chocolates.Originally, we went there for the sake of the deliriously awesome handmade chocolates. Since it's about 2 PM, it's obvious the popular Crème brûlée was out of stock when I asked the woman behind the counter. But when I glanced at the chocolate display, I saw MACARONS!Wuh? They sell maccies here?!My eyes went wide open and I asked the saleswoman, \"What are the macaron flavors?\" And she named them and it totaled up to eight. I said to her, \"I'll take one of everything.\" The total was $18.80. Yep, it's a splurge but for my macaron obsession, there are no bounds (well...almost) to what I'll do for it. I left Dave and went home to try these little cookies, in hopes of coming closer to fulfilling my macaron dreams (and Robyn's as well, since we share this obsession).My bag of macciesTop view of plated macaronsAngled view of plated macaronsIf you want to know the names of each individual macaron, just click the above photo. Anyways, the macarons in general are pretty good. It's soft and fresh but most of the flavors are too subtle for my taste. It's not as flavorful as their chocolate fillings are in comparison, even though most of these macaron fillings are inspired from their own chocolate flavors. The best tasting ones were the raspberry and passion fruit. The lavender was close but it needed another notch of flavor to be almost perfect. I was hoping the rose lychee was going to be delicious since it sounds really enticing but the flavors were too weak that neither really stood out but the filling was creamy.Addresses: Gray's Papaya 402 Avenue Of The Americas New York, NY 10011Yolato 120 Macdougal Street New York, NY 10012Kee's Chocolates 80 Thompson Street New York, NY 10012

Giulia: It was a long fooding day of sorts but at least I ate macarons....Kathy: I was hoping that Kee's would have their creme brulee truffles but that's too far fetched for that to happen in the early afternoon. Oh well...next time, perhaps.

I know there's a huge gap of time between my dinner at Alta and what happened on last Friday. The reason is that I'm working in Queens. Yes, I know it's the U.N. sitting in one borough but the area where I'm working at is near a mall...and the food scene seems very depressing to say the least.Moving on to last Friday...I have planned a huge outing for most of my close friends, most of them are from St. John's and there's Ariel who was the newcomer of the bunch, but he's cool in my book. What I originally planned was inviting these people to see the first concert at South Street Seaport's Music Festival, since I'm a fan of the Animal Collective and have dinner afterwards nearby the Seaport. I left work early that day and I had some time to snack on a couple of things, particularly with the fact that I received an email from La Maison du Chocolat at Rockefeller Center, that they were selling ice cream!My scoop of caramel ice creamClose up of ice creamTexture shotIt's a perfect time to eat ice cream since that day was really humid and hot; you can notice the fact that the ice cream's melting even though this place is air conditioned. Anyways, the caramel ice cream was tasty. It had a nice salty, burnt sugar flavor. The negative part was that it was a bit too icy that I think they set the freezer a bit too cold. Should I mention that it's also a bit pricey? It's $4 for that cup or should I say scoop of ice cream...the price tag is not too far from Grom.Just because I'm at LMDC, I can't resist the temptation of eating their wonderful bonbons. So, I ended up ordering a plate of 'em (click on the close-up photo for the flavors/names) for $11. Yes, it's expensive but worth every penny.Plate of BonbonsIt was a fancy way to get sugared up. Then I practically ran to the subway to go downtown to the Seaport, since it's 5 PM. I got there in about 30 minutes. The crowd of young teenagers and college-aged kids are there already. Somehow, I feel like an anomaly of sorts by the way I was dressed...I didn't change from work hence my wardrobe.That's me...waiting (photo taken by Kim)The crowd an hour 30 minutes before the showAs time passes by around 10 minutes before the show started, some of my friends showed up, like Ariel, Julie, Kim, and others. However, as the concert started and continued, many others were frantically calling me and texting me since I can't be heard even as I'm screaming the top of my lungs to my cell phone, just because they can't find me. Eh. My throat was in pain and I'm losing people because they can't find me or they had to leave early because of other engagements they have to be at. So, I'm getting disappointed. Even the concert was (unfortunately) disappointing. After the first act, who was a pretty good DJ, everything else fell apart. I hate to admit it, Animal Collective was not what I had in mind, comparing them from their album to them in person.Anyways, this is not a music blog. Just to sum it up, I am famished, hot, and annoyed with the weed smokers that Ariel and I decided that we should leave early and get food. I called and text messaged everyone, telling them that I want food! Seriously, I was living off of a granola bar for lunch and those two items from LMDC (and it's now 8:30). Eventually, my huge group got separated because of different interests. I want food, the other didn't so eventually my group became a group of five girls (Robyn, Helen, Seungmi, Julie, and moi) and a guy (Ariel).I wanted to go to Nelson Blue for dinner since they serve New Zealand cuisine. However, when we peered the restaurant, it looked like a sports bar: large LCD panels displaying a baseball game, it's packed with people, and it does look like a bar. It totally me turned off and even Ariel agreed with my sentiments. So we backtracked to the tapas restaurant we've passed a block ago, Salud! The open doors, sexy lighting, and the buzzing, festive atmosphere seem like a promising place for a group outing.The Bar AreaInterior shot from the upper levelWe were seated immediately when we requested for seating of 6, which eradicated any worries of mine about the lack of seating from most restaurants in this nabe. We took a glance at this menu and the first thing that Ariel wanted was a drink. Helen, Ariel, and I thought of getting our cocktail but then Helen asked what was sangria. After explaining to her that it's basically red wine mixed in with fruits and its juices, we eventually decided to order a pitcher of it and Ariel still wanted to get drunk, so he also added a mango braz caiprihana. As for the food, we ordered two orders of bacalitos and ceviches each, the ensalada de camaron (shrimp salad), ensalada de pollo, tequilaso, paella, asopaito, and a side of yuca frites.Glasses of SangriaAriel's CaipirhanaThe sangria tasted pretty good. It's smooth, fruity, and light. As for Ariel's drink, he told me that it's good but he prefers the original, sans the mango. Then the server came back with a plate of fried plantain chips served with a spicy, black bean dip.Our first course of sorts, were the bacalitos, fried balls of bacalhau (salted cod fish predominant in Portuguese and Brazilian food) and mashed potatoes. It was good but I wasn't enamored with it.The ensalada de camaron was a shrimp and avocado salad. It tasted good due to the creamy avocado with the crisp, chopped lettuce, I like the textural contrast. The coconut vinaigrette was an intriguing flavor addition to the salad.The other salad we ordered was the ensalada de pollo, in other words a chicken salad. This is not the American stuff where there are globs of mayonnaise; this has a more international flavor. The salad is composed of radicchio, arugula, chopped grilled chicken, peppers, almonds, and topped with shredded cheese. It's quite tasty. Somehow Ariel said that it tasted like a Thai salad, which I agree since it had that sweet, sour and salty flavor from the ingredients of the salad and the dressing that is mixed in it.The ceviche looked like chopped shrimp swimming in a pool of salsa, dressed up in a martini glass. It tasted fine but where's the shrimp? At least the salsa had a tiny bit of a spicy kick, but disappointed in what we've gotten.The most interesting dish of the evening, presentation-wise, was the tequilaso.Top viewWe were all thinking, \"Is that salt on fire?\" Yeah, it actually is. I think they soaked the salt with a bit of tequilla and lit it. I just grabbed a spoon and fish out a shrimp. Boy, was that thing SPICY! Initially, I tasted the sweet shrimp but then the heat of that bold red, chipotle sauce kicked the back of my throat like someone lit a match on it. I drank half of my glass of water to calm it a few notches but it still burned. Tasty but damn hot.We waited a while for our main course of paella to arrive.That plate o' rice and seafood looked tempting...but I wanted to steer away from the lobster or any of the shellfish just because of my fear of an allergic reaction. The rice was delicious though, especially those crisp parts where the rice stuck onto the pan; that's the best part of the paella.Our tiny plate of yuca (also known as cassava) frites arrived as we dug into our paella. The serving size equated one frite per person. It tasted fine; topped with finely chopped garlic and chives, but I wanted more frites!It looks puny...The last food course of the evening finally arrived, the asopaito. On their menu, it was a seafood stew but it looks like a seafood soup to me. Honestly, I was expecting something related to a cioppino. It tasted fine and it was chocked full of seafood like calamari (squid), clams, and vegetables but nothing remarkable about this soup or stew.Zoomed in slightly...As we finished our meal, half of us took photos (as in Robyn, Julie and myself). This one came out the best so here's Robyn and Julie really happy.They're adorable and happy!As a requirement for Robyn and I, we MUST have dessert. But after perusing their dessert menu, it's mostly geared for more liquor. The only solid dessert was flan...and I wasn't craving flan. Strangely enough, Ariel really wanted to get drunk that night and he wanted another drink. Helen didn't mind sharing a martini with him, so they ordered a chocolate coconut martini.Helen said that this martini was a bit too sweet for her liking. Ariel on the other hand, just tipped that whole thing in 3 seconds...obviously he liked it a lot.After that was done, we paid the check, walked to the subway station (except for Julie who lived nearby, lucky girl), exchanged hugs and goodbyes, and went home. What a looong night and thank goodness I didn't have to work on Saturday.Address: La Maison du Chocolat 30 Rockefeller Plz New York, NY 10112Salud! 142 Beekman Street New York, NY 10038

A Divine Dinner at Alta

***CONTENT
I have heard soo many great things from foodies about Alta that I was dying to go there for the past few years. The two things that held me back was the fact that they only serve dinner and I don't have anyone to eat out with me. That's until I went there a few weeks ago, my friend Dave was willing to come along with me.Entrance to AltaWhen we entered the restaurant, the lighting was really dim, sexy, and romantic. The entire place was practically candlelit. It's spacious and it looks like an old country farmhouse from the inside, even though the entrance photo you have just seen looks like a townhouse.Candlelit chandeliers hanging aboveDiners across the roomDiners below...We were seated on the second floor, occasionally glancing at the first floor's happenings since this place is popular and it's packed within half an hour from opening time (which was 6 PM). Anyways, started off with drinks. He ordered the Cosmopolitan and I had their cocktail, the Bloody Orange Margarita.Both drinks tasted ok. The bartender who made these drinks had a pretty heavy hand on the liquor that the flavors and tastes were off that it tastes more boozy than smooth and fruity (at least for my drink).When our waitress asked what we would like to order, we chose the Fried Goat Cheese, Bacon wrapped dates, the Philadelphia Truffle Surprise, Crispy Brussels Sprouts, Moroccan Bistilla of Chicken Confit, Grilled Chorizo Wrapped Gulf Shrimp, and the Carpaccio Of Beef. Yes, it seems like a lot of food but note that this is a tapas bar, where small plates are served and meant to be shared amongst other people than a single serving in most restaurants.Fried Goat CheeseInnardsThe fried goat cheese balls were awesome! It's fried to a crisp, golden brown perfection. The tangy, pungent goat cheese is smooth, creamy, and peppery that it's been contrasted with the sweet, flowery goodness of the lavender honey.Bacon wrapped datesThe bacon wrapped dates were petite, little finger food that packs a punch on the flavor department. It's sweet, chewy and smoky, and nutty (it's stuffed with almonds) all in one bite. I'm dying of happiness...Philadelphia Truffle SurpriseWhen I read the Philadelphia Truffle Surprise on the menu, it sounded odd to me. Cream cheese and truffles? But it actually came out wonderfully. The crisp, deep-fried puff pastry filled with creamy, tangy, cream cheese flavored with musky, earthy truffle oil. It's fabulous.Carpaccio of BeefThe beef was of good quality and it's topped with horseradish créme frâiche and orange supremes but the flavors weren't bold enough to be remembered. The beef carpaccio was the least tantalizing food for the evening.Grilled Chorizo Wrapped Gulf ShrimpThis dish was good. The chorizo was delicious and flavorful, with a hint of smoky, charred flavor from grilling but the shrimp was overcooked and a bit rubbery. The bed of avocado mousse that these shrimp are laying on top of, did not contribute much in terms of flavor, texture-wise it makes the shrimp more buttery but in my opinion, it's a bit superfluous.Moroccan Bistilla of ChickenThe Moroccan Bistilla of Chicken which is basically layers of phyllo dough filled with spiced meat, was a bit disappointing. It supposed to be creamy, since it was indicated from the menu but it came out to be fully cooked and chunky. The chicken confit was barely moist but it tender. The delicate mixture of Moroccan spices (such as cardamom, anise, cinnamon, and clove), with the chicken, sweet, dried currants and scallions made it taste delicious. It's a disappointment in terms of texture but it tastes so good.Crispy Brussels Sprouts - Side viewCrispy Brussels Sprouts - Top viewWe almost forgotten about the Crispy Brussels Sprouts because we ate so much food! But it's this dish is always welcome, in my book at least. This is one of Alta's signature dishes. It's deep-fried Brussels sprouts mixed with apple cider reduction (hence the caramelized flavor) topped with slices of Fuji apple, swirls of crème fraiche, and a sprinkling of pistachio nuts. Oh my god, this was divine. Honestly, it would convert the Brussels sprout hater to a lover of this vegetable.That's the end of our dinner. We're too stuffed for dessert so the check has been paid and parted ways to go home. Alta is officially one of my favorite restaurants.Address: Alta 64 W 10th Street New York, NY 10011

I am just back from a Cuban restaurant (Cafe con Leche) with some Spanish friends. And we were talking about tapas bar, wondering where the good ones were. Questions answered! This one is very tempting.

I know that an odd number of ingredients looks best for presentation, but why do tapas bars still serve up odd portions like the goats cheese and gulf shrimp!? Ha ha.
An interesting read as per usual ^^

Juliette: I haven't gone to Cafe con Leche, but I heard good things about it! I want to go... Anyways, I highly suggest you go to Alta.Rich: I think I know what you mean. I just think that it gives the food a focal point when it has an odd number of items. Methinks.Thanks for reading! :)

Oh, I think my comment is a little unclear. I meant it in the context that if tapas is supposed to be shared it makes sense to have an even amount of food (^_^;)

Food Happenings of Last Wednesday...

I'm still waaay behind on posting my fooding since I'm still stuck with last week and this week is ended...eh. I'm sorry. It's just my day job is killing me with stress and I'm tired therefore the lack of writing. Moving on...Last Wednesday, I went to the Financial District for Dine Around Downtown.What this event basically is (or was) that a bunch of local restaurants within the Financial District would set up booths to these hungry finance people who work near Wall Street, as well as tourists or local residents. Honestly, I didn't have high expectations from reading the list of what restaurants were there. I just hoped that Bouley's food would be good or at least worthwhile to go for. So, here's my first stop at Bouley Market & Bakery.Bouley Bakery's standI thought my heart stopped when I saw them...macarons! I just went straight for them since you know how obsessed I am with macarons.I ended up choosing four macarons just for the sake of not killing myself with sugar...and it's the first thing I'm eating for lunch.My macciesInnards of all of 'em; left to right: fresh mint, peach saffron, rose, and peanut butterThese four babies cost me $6...which isn't so bad. The fresh mint macaron was terribly dry when I bit into it and the flavor just diminished within mere moments. Ugh...it's like a stale macaron. I'm disappointed. The peach saffron macaron fared a lot better. It's moist, good bold, apricot flavor with slight hints of bitterness and aroma of saffron; it was pretty darn good. The rose macaron was moist as well. I've heard bad things about Bouley's ishpan (basically a rose flavored pastry with tiny cubes of lychee; sounds weird but so good when it's done correctly) but this particular macaron came out pretty well; the rose flavor wasn't too overbearing but you can taste the rose. The peanut butter macaron had the same texture as the fresh mint macaron: it's dry but the peanut butter flavor was good and it lingered longer on the palate than the mint. So, it's a mixed result of the macarons.As I walked all around Chase Manhattan Plaza for some savory food, I was terribly disappointed in what was offered. Either the food is too expensive for what one gets (e.g. Bouley, the restaurant, gives you an endive leaf topped with a tablespoon of tuna tartare for $6) or it's just unappealing to me (e.g. sandwiches or burgers). I was tempted to get some of Moksha's food but the line is building up.Being the impatient person that I am, I just went for Financier's booth for another round of dessert. It's been a long time since I've eaten their stuff...the last time I went there was the time I've written about their scones, croissants, and macarons (about last October or so).Cheesecake DomesFruit tartletsRiz Au Lait Apricot MoussesThe pastry that really tempted me was the chocolate mousse cake. Oh, the seduction of chocolate...So, I ended up buying a slice of that cake...and here's the photo session obsession. (Note: these photos were taken with a 50mm f/1.8 prime lens)Yeah, it's pretty and I'm amused with it. Anyways, the cake was very chocolatey but not something you would die with an overdose of chocolate. It's very light and creamy in texture, the chocolate was of good quality ranging from a milk chocolate to dark chocolate (~50% to 62%). It's good for what it is and where this place is located. Honestly, this is the better bakeries/patisseries in the Financial/Wall Street district.I left there around 1:30, where almost everyone from the nearby offices and Chase employees themselves left for lunch. It's too crowded to walk or eat around that I can't stand it anymore.Eventually towards the late afternoon, I went to the Upper West Side to Grom. Yess...I love Grom. In hopes they no longer leveling their cups like they had on my previous visit, since I've complained to them via email (and got a reply) a while ago.After standing on line for a while, it seemed like the serving was inconsistent; some were leveled like I had last time and some were decent.Looks decent to me...Oh jeez, it's practically leveled!So it really depends upon who is scooping your lovely gelato. Just hope that you won't end up with a server who is a leveler. Mine came out to be the decent scooper.I had a small cup of cappuccino and pistachio gelato. It tasted awesome as usual but I'm still a bit disappointed that it wasn't as generous of plop as it was on my very first visit. While I was taking photos of this cup of gelato, the manager, Luigi Ferraris, approached me and inquired about my photos. Eventually, he left me alone for a bit and came back with a torrone and mentioned that they're creating a new gelato flavor incorporating this particular confection.The torrone is very good. It's basically an Italian nougat made with almonds. It would be interesting to eat a torrone gelato.That's the end of the daytime events of Wednesday, while you already know what had happened on Wednesday evening with the party at Martha Stewart and the PDT bar.Address: Grom 2165 Broadway New York, NY 10024

A Bittersweet Ending to Restaurant Week: Eleven Madison Park

Lunch at Eleven Madison Park was my last and final restaurant for Restaurant Week on Monday. (For those of you who are still curious when is it over, it's officially this Friday, July 27, 2007; while some restaurants are extending 'til Labor Day.)EMP's interior once you enter...I had high hopes for EMP, since I had a really great experience last time when I tried Chef Humm's Gourmand Menu that courted me to be one of the many fans of this place (if you do a search at Chowhound, you know what I mean or read Frank Bruni of the NY Times' piece). To end Restaurant Week with a good bang of sorts, I ended up with a larger group of friends: Robyn, Helen, Doug, and Ariel.I know some of you are wondering, why is Ariel going out with me to three our of the four restaurants during RW that's because he's a foodie, yet he's not as insane as I am to go to the phones and make the darn reservations...or he's just plain lazy and hate the idea of eating alone.Moving on...most of us were early or on time, with the exception of Ariel since he's stuck at work at the Financial District and showed up half an hour late. What we did was order for him, well actually I ordered for him since no one really know his tastes that well that I had the honors of doing so.Here's the RW menu:Salad of Green Vegetables with Marcona AlmondsBig Eye Tuna with Cherry Lane Farm Asparagus and Montegottero Pistachio OilGreen Market Strawberry Gazpacho with Poached Tiger Prawns and GuancialeEntréesRoasted Chicken with Garden Peas and MorelsSlow Cooked Scottish Salmon with Mediterranean VegetablesGnocchi of La Ratte Potato with “Fleur de Courgette,” Lemon Confit and BottargaDessertMoelleux of Bittersweet Chocolate with Passion fruitAlmond Panacotta with Summer BerriesApricots Clafouti with Almond Honey Ice CreamWhile we were waiting for our food, Doug wanted black tea and we were all served bread and butter. Robyn and I also killed time by taking photos of the interior (you'll see hers when you go to her Flickr photostream or when she writes her post).Olive Roll/mini baguette (Robyn and I had this)InnardsRobyn's second rollDoug holding the butter knifeThe sugar bowlDoug pouring his cup o' teaRobyn was a bit intrigued with the small dish of sea salt and coarse ground black pepper. We were all were fascinated how pretty and elegant EMP's silver butter dish and the teaware were and how the sugar bowl's arranged. The scary thought and comment from Helen was that the entire sugar bowl would make her happy for ONE cup of tea. Oh jeez, I think my skin crawled at that thought...A reflection of us...Interior shot near our tableAll three of us were served appetizers first since we notified the waiter that Ariel will be running late.Here's our appetizers:Plate of salad...Doug's salad of green vegetables with Marcona almonds looks so...pretty. I don't know if the salad have any almonds but from what I can see are fresh peas, Cannellini beans, and leafy vegetables. He says it's good but I have no idea how it taste like since I didn't try it.Chunks of Big Eye TunaRobyn had the Big Eye Tuna with pistachio oil and asparagus. It looks so tiny. The chunks of raw tuna centered in a large white plate, drizzled with pistachio oil and asparagus tips that were cut into quarters. The asparagus part was pointed out by Robyn when she was eating this dish. That cracked me up because it's so incredulous that the chefs are either trying to show their great knife skills or they're so stingy with the food that they're serving small portions to the diners of the Restaurant Week menu.Bowl of Strawberry GazpachoClose upHelen and I (eventually Ariel as well) had the strawberry gazpacho with poached tiger prawns and guanciale. I thought it was creative for the chef to think of putting strawberries in a spicy, savory tomato based soup. It initially tastes like smoky, roasted peppers and tomatoes and the end note is the sweetness of the strawberries. The crunchy bits of guanciale (think Spanish form of bacon) didn't really contribute much in terms of flavor but it's a nice textural contrast to the soup. The tiger prawns gave it a meaty touch to the soup. I can't really see why there are prawns in the soup - the sweetness of the prawns don't really match the strawberries or contrast the smokiness of the gazpacho.Doug describes this soup as something from Jamba Juice. When Ariel ate this his thoughts were along the lines of that it's \"too clever by half, that it was so dainty that is somewhat lost its essence of gazpachoness.\" To elaborate on what Ariel's comment, that's the chef gets points for being so creative but it's not the real gazpacho that one would really want. I concur with Ariel since the one from the Modern he had the past Friday was way better (if you want to read that part again, click here).The entrées:Roasted ChickenRobyn and I had the roasted chicken. It was pretty darn delicious. It's juicy, succulent, and it's cooked perfectly. The morels' and peas' flavors didn't really work too well with the chicken. I do like the fact that the peas and morels were fresh but they don't compliment the chicken to well, in my opinion.Salmon in Foam...When Ariel saw this dish, he started to act like a three year old asking, \"It's made of tomato? Why isn't it white?\" Gah, the things I deal with him... (To answer his question, there is such a thing as white tomatoes. Google it.) Anyways, from what I tasted from Helen's salmon (she, Ariel, and Doug had this dish) the salmon was cooked perfectly. It's flavorful, silky with a crunchy salty crust, and the white tomato foam was pretty interesting. How did the foam taste? Well, it tastes like an essence of mild, sweet tomatoes. Under all that foam is bits of tomatoes and other vegetables that I can't distinguish due to the fact that it's blended.The crazy thing that Ariel did after he ate his salmon and had a large pool of tomato foam remaining was that he asked for another roll and tore it into bits, and then ate it like croutons in a bowl of white tomato soup. I think he's either really hungry or he's ingenious. I'm thinking the former.For sure, the entrées were better the appetizers.And finally, dessert:PanacottaAnother shot of the panacottaClose upAs you can tell, I'm pretty much taken by the aesthetics of this panacotta that Robyn had (Doug and Helen had this too). When I tasted it, I didn't detect any almond flavor or vanilla, even though you can see a ton of vanilla bean specks. The berry sauce that's sitting under that panacotta was minty. It's refreshing but odd to me.Moelleux of Bittersweet ChocolateAriel's moelleux of bittersweet chocolate had a strong, heavy scent of passion fruit that Robyn could smell it from where she's sitting. The passion fruit flavor wasn't as strong as it smells and the chocolate cake was decent.Apricot ClafoutiHelen and I had our own apricot clafouti with almond honey ice cream. The clafouti wasn't creamy enough but it had a nice apricot flavor with chunks of apricot within it. The ice cream was creamier than the Modern's but the almond flavor tasted a bit funny to me. It tasted like they added the almonds in raw form instead of roasting the nuts and I believe they used some almond extract. Why? Just because I tasted something a bit alcoholic as an end note to this ice cream besides the floral note of the honey. Hmmm...that gets me thinking.At the end of our meal, we all discussed openly what we thought of the food we ate. Basically we gave an oral food review. Then Robyn and I just started taking portraits of everyone eating with us, also Helen joined in by using our cameras for a few moments by taking candid photos (you'll see a few on Robyn's post or Flickr).We're waiting...(taken by Helen)The boys are talkin'Group Photo! (sans moi)As for the photo above, much props go to Robyn for helping out on editing this photo. Thank you, Robyn! I LOVE you! Anyways, as I'm looking at this photo, I'm getting all mushy now since I miss everyone.My overall thoughts on EMP during Restaurant Week, the food was decent (the main courses fared the best of the three). It's not as good as my other experiences with this place. Service as always attentive, but they were a bit more on their toes initially because of the fact that when a restaurant have a large group of diners, and two of them happen to have SLR cameras on hand, they should be. I just hope Eleven Madison Park would prove me wrong from this meal was just a bad blip just because it was Restaurant Week. I'll see in the future.Address: Eleven Madison Park 11 Madison Avenue New York, NY 10010

The tomato foam was awesome - I ate mine like a soup as well. The salmon was good too - and the salad was...a salad. The almonds are actually the white things in the picture (theyre blanched).Let's do it again sometime under more delicious circumstances :)

Giulia: The food looks good and beautiful but the flavors of most of them were disappointing.The only thing that made the experience a bit bearable was having a group of friends that have similar thoughts on the food and have a good time kind of hanging out (just because most of us have to work).

it seems most people were disappointed with EMP's RW menu. However, I have to say the pictures look gorgeous. I had the strawberry gazpacho as a free course for dinner and I hated it. I make a mango gazpacho at home so it wasn't so much the sweetness or fruitiness I objected to but that the different flavors just didn't work. Everything else was wonderful.thanks for your blog. I get such satisfaction reading it.

Kim: From what most people who write/respond in Chowhound, EMP's RW menu...well, sucked.  The strawberry gazpacho was interesting for what it is but I don't like it that much.  And yes, I do agree that everything else was wonderful except for dessert during RW, it was horrible. The next time when I come back to EMP in the near future, I want to try their macarons (it's one of my food obsessions).Thanks for liking my blog!  :)

i didnt know that white foam is tomato.. (even thou i had a whole plate by myself..) that has interesting taste, but at first glance, it looked like salmon is floating on bubble bath.. lolmany says RW food was disappointing, but it was so great to me.

Dinner at the Bar Room at the Modern (Restaurant Week)

The past Friday evening, I had dinner at the Bar Room at the Modern with Ariel.Since I have arrived there earlier than he did, I took the time to take in the atmosphere and the vibe of this place since it is so different than what I have experienced for lunch the last time I was here. It's more energetic since it is a Friday night: the after-work crowd, friends and dates having their dinners. It's definitely more relaxed, loud, and arguably chaotic due to the talking, noise, and the start of the weekend.Eventually Ariel arrived and we glanced at the cocktail menu since it's after 6, it's a weekend, he might as well kick back with a drink or two. He decided on having the Coming Up Roses drink and he bought me the Cucumber Caipiroska.Coming Up RosesCucumber CaipiroskaSimilar to what I had last time for the Coming Up Roses, it looks pretty. But the last time I had it, the ice cubes weren't so melted but Ariel enjoyed that drink and he did admit that it had a strong kick at the end. Most likely due to the Bacardi Razz and Champagne that's in the drink. My Cucumber Caipiroska was refreshing. It does have the flavor of a cucumber and had hints of citrus-like flavor from the Hanger One Buddha’s Hand (it's a citron infused vodka).The bread has arrived with the drinks shortly after, it's basically consisted of mini baguettes and slices of multi-grain bread. It's fine but nothing that's meant to change my life.The Restaurant Week Menu:orTomato and Almond Gazpacho with fresh Mediterranean RougetorCharred Octopus with chickpea-radish salad, salsa verde and crispy capersEntréeSwordfish with eggplant caviar and teardrop tomato saladorBeer Braised Pork Belly with suarkraut and ginger jusorRoasted Garlic Gnocchi with wild mushroom, sage and crispy sweetbreadsDessertChocolate Tart with vanilla ice creamorCherry Claufuti with pistachio ice creamorCoconut Tapioca with mangoHere's our appetizers for the evening:Tomato and almond gazpachoAriel's Tomato and Almond Gazpacho with Mediterranean Rouget was sublime. It tasted like roasted peppers and tomatoes blended with a hint of paprika and creme fraiche - spicy and creamy with a touch of tang. The almond is in the soup only in terms of giving it body (in other words, a thicker texture). The rouget was a nice twist since it matches the spicy flavor of the gazpacho and gave it some heft and meatiness to a vegetarian soup.My Arctic Char Tartare was wonderful as well. The char was silky, slightly tart, and slightly spicy from the black pepper that is in it.Heck, when Ariel had both my appetizer and his...he had a foodgasm.Then came the main course:Ariel's Roasted Garlic Gnocchi with wild mushroom, sage and crispy sweetbreads was good - from what he told me. I didn't bother trying it because I ate this dish when I was here last time. The crispy nuggets of sweetbreads work so well to the soft, airy, chewy gnocchi. The morels that are found in this dish compliments the earthiness of the sweetbreads.My swordfish was fine. It was cooked to a medium rare, as requested. It was served on a bed of eggplant caviar, which is basically spicy mashed/blended eggplant, and teardrop tomato salad. The fish was meaty and it the slight char on the fish gave it a slight smoky flavor. The tomato salad brought some acidity and brightness to the heavier flavors and textures of this dish. It didn't make me swoon but I liked it.To top off the entire meal, dessert...Ariel's cherry clafouti was good. It's not the traditional French clafouti where it looks somewhat like a bread fruit pudding - the butter tart shell is not supposed to be there. It tastes good nonetheless. The warm, creamy, pudding-like texture of the filling with sweet cheeries was very tasty. I don't know about the quenelle of pistachio ice cream on the side but it looks ok.My chocolate tart was mediocre. The milk chocolate filling in this tart was grainy, not ganache-like smooth. The tart shell was fine but that gritty texture really bothered me as I ate this tart. The quenelle of vanilla ice cream was not creamy enough. I am really disappointed.As expected though, from many foodies who have eaten at this place many more times than I have, their appetizers are the stars of this restaurant; entrees are second best, while their desserts are (arguably) their Achilles' heel.On a side note, their bathrooms look quite nice and some say sexy, with the flattering lighting and the use of incense to perfume the bathroom.One more restaurant to go (or should I say write about since it did occur?)...and that's Eleven Madison Park.Address: The Bar Room at the Modern 9 W 53rd Street New York, NY 10019

Alexis: I'm sorry that your sweetbreads weren't so great. Honestly, I have no idea how were Ariel's (my dining companion that night) sweetbreads since he ate the whole dish himself.

This is considered Round 1 of Restaurant Blitz Week, as I call it, since most foodies who love to eat out would try to nab reservations at the pricier yet delicious restaurants around New York City. I admit I was one of the crazy people who would call the restaurant's reservation line about a month in advance the moment it's open...as well as making arrangements with people who can eat with me on that particular day.I think the gods knew that the day I wanted time off from work on Wednesday, went against me and made me feel miserable. Why? The rain fell like there was no tomorrow during the morning.It's Pouring!All the commuters were stuck underground due to the flooded tracks and everyone was running late. OMG. I hate public transportation but I depend on it to get to the city. *sighs* Anyways, I eventually got there but soaking wet and peeved.This similar scenario occurred to all of my friends who were joining me later in the afternoon. They were almost an hour late. Yeah, you've read that correctly an hour. I don't blame them for being late, I'm blaming MTA (the mass transportation agency run by the city). I felt awful especially for Helen since she's traveling from Staten Island to the Upper East Side, and that took her at least two hours. Poor thing.While I was waiting in the restaurant, Aureole I met one of my readers, Carol. To my surprise, she recognized my face and she stopped for a few moments to introduce to her and say hi to me. Um, Carol if you're reading this now, I'm terribly sorry for my lack of words I didn't say to you since you caught me off guard and frazzled wondering where the heck are my friends but it was certainly nice meeting you!Eventually Robyn, Giulia, and Helen have arrived. If you've been a reader for a while you remember the latter two from the macaron/fooding hunt we all participated the past April.We all gathered into this gorgeous, elegant, Upper East Side restaurant and were escorted to the second floor to be seated.AureoleInterior of Aureole; Ground floorHere's the menu.Restaurant Week Summer 2007 MenuFirst Course SelectionsChilled Sweet Pea Soup crab crisp, lemon & pepper cream, shaved radishes Composed Salad of Shaved Country Ham, Grilled Figs & Bitter Greens preserved lemon, aged balsamic vinaigretteHot Smoked Salmon Raw Tomato Tart, AvocadoMain Course SelectionsSeared Hake Warm summer bean salad, salsa verdeRoasted Amish Chicken Scallion Risotto Sweet Garlic & Herb jusGarganelli Pasta with Wild Mushrooms & Caramelized Onions tomato confit, wilted arugula and goat cheeseDessert SelectionsTriple Chocolate Terrine banana ice cream, caramelized plantainsLemon Ricotta Cheesecake minted mixed berries and consommeWe eventually ordered, since we were contemplating what we want to eat. Then the bread and butter was served. We had a choice of an olive roll, French roll, sour cream foccacia, and a multigrain roll. Giulia chose the olive, Robyn and Helen each had the French roll, I had the focaccia.Giulia's Olive RollFrench RollFrench Roll InnardsMy Sour Cream FoccaciaButter...My focaccia was fine but it was tiny. The appealing part about eating that particular piece of bread was the sea salt sprinkled on top giving it some personality to the almost bland, chewy bread. The sweet butter was good but it was cold, as you probably see from the cold butter plate. I prefer my butter to be at least room temperature for any spreading.Then came out our appetizers.Robyn's Chilled Pea SoupRobyn's pea soup was really refreshing and tasty. It's like eating fresh peas in puréed form. I'm assuming the crab crisp was good since she did eat it...but she'll tell you when her post is up.Helen's Composed SaladHelen's composed salad contained a large, thinly shaved slice of Idaho country ham, grilled figs, bitter greens, preserved lemon zest, and drizzled with aged balsamic vinaigrette. Helen never tried figs before and she's willing to try them hence her ordering it. She liked the figs since it's so sweet. The ham was proscuitto-like but it lacked that melt-in-your-mouth texture that proscuitto normally has but it's still pretty delicious. The bitter greens (which were basically frisée, arugula, and radicchio) didn't appeal to her at all. She doesn't like bitter or sour foods so she pretty much shared the greens out.My Hot Smoked Salmon (Giulia also ordered this)The hot smoked salmon was delicious. I really loved the heirloom tomatoes used in this dish because it contrasts the earthiness of the salmon - bright, sweet acidity. The avocado on top was really creamy and it brought some richness that is needed for this dish. The tart underneath all of the tomatoes was very crisp, even though it was practically the last thing I ate from that dish.The main courses...Helen's Garganelli pasta with wild mushrooms tasted really good. The tomato confit in this dish contrasted the earthiness of the mushrooms; the goat cheese sprinkled on top gave the pasta a tangy, pungent bite.Giulia's roasted Amish chicken was practically one of the best chicken dishes I've ever had in a long time. It's juicy, well seasoned with the beautiful golden skin. I liked the scallion risotto - creamy and cooked spot-on - but I think the cheese was a bit heavy-handed.Robyn and I each ordered the seared hake. This is a fabulous fish dish. The hake was seared to perfection. The etheral, crisp crust meets sweet, fleshy fish. The spicy, red pepper sauce, which I think is supposed to be the salsa verde, is a good pairing to the fish. The various summer beans that are in this dish made it hearty and filling.Then came dessert!We were all feeling for chocolate. Hey, we're women! We love our chocolate. Anyways, the best thing from this dessert was a bit of a shocker - the banana ice cream. That's the quenelle-shaped scoop that is sitting in front of the terrine the photo above. The ice cream was wonderfully rich and creamy, and the banana flavor was very concentrated. It tasted like they used a pound of ripe bananas and pack it all in a pint of ice cream with a touch of cinnamon, nutmeg, and allspice. Yeah, it's very banana-y. I'll take a gallon of it home if I could. The crunchy cookie (possibly graham cracker?) crumbs that sit on the bottom of the ice cream made it even better. Yums.The chocolate terrine was tasty but it's a bit too sweet for my taste. The dense chocolate terrine has specks of praline floating around that brings in textural contrasts that is needed for all that creaminess.The caramelized plantains were the biggest disappointment. It didn't compliment the dish since it has the texture of a potato and it doesn't really taste like a banana. The starchiness of the plantain wasn't really cooked out so it has the texture of a potato, not the smooth, creaminess of a banana.Robyn happily eating dessertShe ate the plantain...We had fun with taking photos of each other during dessert and a bit after. We paid the check and left to the nearest subway station since Robyn and Giulia has to go back to work downtown. Helen and I joined them to go for another of round of dessert. I know it sounds ridiculous but we're melting in the subway, I don't have enough time to watch the movie Ratatouille with Helen, and she never tried gelato before and she's up for it. So why not?We headed down to Otto for some gelato. As we perused their menu, Helen decided on the Black & White Coppetta and I have the Ricotta & Lemon Coppetta.Helen's coppetta was very delicious. Basically, the entire thing was sweet: milk chocolate gelato, creme fraiche gelato, caramel flavored whipped cream, and chocolate covered hazelnuts.I was feeling for something lighter and tart since the dessert at Aureole was basically chocolate and bananas. The lemon sorbet was very tart and smooth. The ricotta gelato was creamy and delicious. The sweet sauteed cherries contrasted the acidic flavors of the lemon curd and sorbet. This wasn't exactly a light dessert in terms of calories but it's better than laying on the chocolate and sugar like Helen's Black and White.Helen caught me at a weak moment...Well, that's it for this insane day of eating out. Seriously, that evening I just ate steamed vegetables since I was really sinful and gluttonous with lunch and the extra dessert. Eh. Three more restaurants to go...Addresses: Aureole 34 E 61st Street New York, NY 10021Otto 1 5th Avenue New York, NY 10003

I must disagree with you'r opener there, that seem like a fitting start to resteraunt week. (PS I'm still swooning over you'r ability to participate in something like that, my town has nothing for foodies.)
Really when you think about any day that lets you try two desserts that are atleast MARGAINALLY good is a good day. Well, maybe that's just in my book. It sounds asif you'r actual lunch was quite satisfying aswell. (see all in perspective.)
I can't wait to hear more, keep posting!

Some things in life are better simple. Take cake for example. I know a typical person would love cake slathered in buttercream or any smooth, sweet frosting. I would too...but I wasn't feeling fussy these days since a batch of buttercream wouldn't survive the heat in my kitchen since these days the weather in New York City it is hot and humid: a baker's worst enemies. I just wanted a simple pound cake - unadulterated, simple but nevertheless delicious.Pound cake - interior viewThis is technically my second try on the pound cake. The first time I attempted to bake this cake was about a year ago when the texture of the cake was fine, the flavors weren't working for me.I'm happy to say I finally conquered the pound cake this time. The cake's crumb is fine and even and moist. It smells buttery, with a faint hint of lemon from the use of its zest and extract and vanilla. Sure, my kitchen was hot as hell since it took about an hour and 10 minutes to bake this entire loaf but it's worth it.My route to cool myself off is to get myself a shot glass worth of ice cream when I'm patiently waiting for my cake to be done.Here's the recipe for the pound cake.Sour Cream Pound CakeIngredients: 1/2 pound (2 sticks) butter 3 cups sugar 1 cup sour cream 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 1 teaspoon baking powder 3 cups all-purpose flour 1/2 teaspoon salt 6 large eggs 2 teaspoons vanilla 1 medium lemon, zested 1 teaspoon lemon extract1. Preheat oven to 325 degrees F.2. In a large mixing bowl, cream the butter and sugar together. Add the sour cream and mix until incorporated. Sift the baking soda, baking powder, salt, and flour together. Add to the creamed mixture alternating with eggs, beating each egg 1 at a time. Add the vanilla extract, lemon zest, and lemon extract then stir until just incorporated. Pour the mixture into a greased and floured 8 x 4-inch loaf pan. Bake for 1 hour 10 minutes or until the toothpick comes clean when inserted.Note: There will be leftover batter remaining after you fill up your loaf pan. What I did was make a dozen cupcakes out of them since it's enough for a pan's worth; just bake for 15 - 20 minutes at the same temperature as the loaf.

I have seen eggles sponge cake recipies, although I've never tried them so I dont know if the finished product will resemble a flourless cake more or a airy sponge cake.
Try things like the Millenium cookbook and other vegitarian oriented books. I  noticed in mellenium they said to use maple syrup for a sponge cake rather than brown suger, I don't now if this was to make up for the eggs but maybe...

I'm kind of lazy these days due to the heat of the city...and I'm not really eating out just because I'm fasting (sort of) due to the coming of Restaurant Week! I'm planning to have three lunches and a dinner within three days. Sounds like fun yet my weight's going to take a toll. Oh boy...Technically, Restaurant Week is ten days long (starting on Monday, July 16th) but I'm not willing to spend that much money and I can't eat that many courses and restaurants. Sure, if I had a basal metabolic rate of a hummingbird then I don't mind eating a lot.To give you a little bit of a preview on future posts, I'm first going to Aureole, then to Aquavit Cafe, the Bar Room at the Modern, and cap it all off with one of my favorite restaurants at the moment, Eleven Madison Park.In case you are participating RW at the Bar Room at the Modern for dinner, here's a preview of one of the entrées they are serving. (I know this because they've sent me the menu.)You know what it is if you have read my post back a few months ago when I had lunch there.If I happen to see you at any of these places during Restaurant Week, Yay! If not, well...if you happen to be in the city anytime in the fall, I'll be there due to classes (and obviously eating around with my camera on-hand).

Oh my god! How lucky are you? May we switch shoes please? But no seriously that sounds fantastic I wish I were you. I'm somewhat of a wannabe food critic myself and last night finally got out to one of these fancy new \"haut\" resteraunts for my birthday. (It was Lido's here in shell beach. http://www.thedolphinbay.com/lido_restaurant/) I sort of found the dinner to be a bit of a disapointment (overcooking, oversalting, small portions etc...) But their desert chef more than made up for it. But really thats great for you, good luck!

Casper: First of all, Happy Birthday!
Me? Lucky? Perhaps for the opportunity to eat out that much... I am just dreading the fact that I'm eating a lot of food within a short span of time, especially one of those days I'm eating a lunch and dinner in one day. Thanks for the wishes!  :)

The past Sunday, I went out to the city with one of my best friends, Seungmi for dinner. But we agreed to meet up in the late afternoon for the sake of an odd flavor combination for a chocolate bar: chocolate and bacon. Intriguing? It was to us. So we head down to SoHo to the Chicago-based, trendy chocolate shop, Vosges Haut Chocolat.Once we stepped into this place, we were contemplating what we want to get. We did have the chocolate bar we wanted. I got the Mo Bar and Seungmi got herself the Calindia Bar ($7 each). But I can't resist a cold glass of Bianca chocolate ($5).The Bianca tasted a lot better cold than I had a few months ago hot. The lavender and vanilla is well balanced with the white chocolate and ice-cold milk. It was delicious but for $5, it left me desiring for a bit more than served.Seungmi holding our chocolateBacon + Chocolate?!Side-by-side of Calindia Bar (left) and Mo Bar (right)Seungmi's Calindia bar was tasty. It contained 65% chocolate, bits of dried plums, and walnuts. The cardamom imparted spicy, floral tones that contrasted the sweetness of the plums and slightly emphasized the bitter tones of the chocolate. You may think of it as a grown up version of the Chunky bar but spicier (not hot-spicy more like a warm curry-spicy, if that made any sense?) and tinier chunks of nuts and dried fruit.As for my Mo Bar, which is the apple wood smoked bacon with 45% semi-sweet chocolate, tasted surprisingly delicious. The salty, smokiness of the bacon worked so well with the sweet, slightly caramel-like finished chocolate. I was hooked that I bought another bar. Yeah, I love pork in all of it's glorious versatility from savory to sweet.After savoring our chocolate, we walked over to Alphabet City (which is the East Village) to meet up with Ariel to have dinner at Esashi.Back interiorLooking toward the frontAfter talking out what we wanted to eat, Ariel was enthusastic on trying out the Tiger Eye, so we ordered two plates of that ($6.75 each) and a Maki Roll Set (Seungmi), Sushi Dinner (mine), and Beef negimaki (Ariel's) for main courses, each were $10.95. As for beverages, Seungmi had a ginger ale ($2) and Ariel was curious with Japanese beer and ended up ordering one ($7.50).Ariel's beerHis qualms with the beer was that it's light (it looks like a pale ale) and it tastes like a Bud.Moving onto the food. The typical miso soup (a bit better than the ones I've tasted so far but the tofu needs to be soft or silken; not firm like they always use) and salad.I had a tiff with this salad. It has a bit of that creamy, gingery dressing which I don't really enjoy but don't really hate either. But what really killed my appetite and palate was the huge pool of soy sauce that these greens were swimming in. The salt (as much as I appreciate it) was too much for me to take that I was unconsciously playing my salad with my chopsticks, that I stopped doing as soon as Seungmi pointed that out.When the appetizers arrived, the Tiger Eye, my food moods changed for this place.The Tiger Eye is basically the squid stuffed with spicy salmon. It's quite good actually - squid is cooked perfectly and it had a nice spicy kick from the sauce that coated this appetizer.Then our main courses arrived...Seungmi's Maki RollsAriel's Beef NegimakiMy SushiRegardless to the fact that we had our own set, we ultimately shared our food since there's plenty to go around. Ariel's beef negimaki was really tasty due to the salty crust on the beef. Seungmi and my sushi and makis were above average than what I usually get from a typical Japanese sushi joint. The fish were fresher and were of a better grade.After we were done with dinner, we walked over to Clinton Street for dessert. Why? Since it's Seungmi's birthday yesterday (July 2nd) I wanted to treat her for some awesome dessert that I've been hearing for years at WD-50.Since it's a Sunday night, there isn't that many diners. I don't mind it since we do have a bit more attention from the waiters and they are a bit more patient than what one would experience on a Friday or Saturday night. Anyways, we all discussed what should we have since going for the tasting menu route is a bit expensive and what Ariel said, \"a bit self indulgent.\" What we ended up doing is order four desserts a la carte ($11 each):1. Soft Chocolate, Avocado, Licorice, Lime 2. Coconut mousse, cashew, cucumber, coriander 3. Yuzu, shortbread, spruce yogurt, pistachio 4. Local strawberries, pandan, popcorn sorbetBut before all of these desserts were served, they've brought out a large container of sesame flatbread. It's pretty good.Angled view of the flatbreadThen out came all the desserts...Soft Chocolate, Avocado, Licorice, LimeThe soft chocolate dessert was delicious, to say the least. The large green drops of avocado enhances the soft, creamy ribbon of chocolate ganache, and imparting the subtle flavor of avocado. The lime and licorice were very subtle yet it gave off slightly bright flavors. I love it - it all just melts-in-your-mouth goodness.Coconut mousse, cashew, cucumber, corianderThe coconut mousse, cashew, cucumber, coriander dessert that is shown above is particularly interesting to photograph. It's so architectural in ways that the spiral of the coriander-speckled tuile makes it so appealing for me to go crazy with photographing this darn dessert. Here's more photos...Besides being so engaging to the viewer, it tastes so wonderful. The long, creamy rope of coconut mousse, meets the crisp coriander tuile and crunchy cashews make it so texturally interesting. Creamy meets crunchy and crisp. The cucumber gave the dessert a tiny, distinctive refreshing breath of air, if you will, from the earthy flavors of the coconut and cashews. This is sublime.Macro of the Yuzu, shortbread, spruce yogurt, pistachioThis yuzu, shortbread dessert was also delicious. The bright, citrusy flavor that is the signature of the yuzu worked well with the buttery, crisp shortbread and the pistachios. The spruce yogurt wasn't as astringent as I would thought it would be, since spruce is a technically a type of pine tree - it was very subtle.Local strawberries, pandan, popcorn sorbetMacro of the Local strawberries, pandan, popcorn sorbetThis dessert above screams \"SUMMER!,\" due to the gorgeous, sweet, ripened strawberries that are in season. The popcorn sorbet was different to say the least. It's very scrumptious but it's so hard to describe it in words...you just have to try it. The pandan (another name for it is screwpine leaves) tasted almost minty.And I almost forgotten...Seungmi's birthday dessert.It's a passion fruit chocolate cake of sorts. It's not cake in what you normally associate with cake but it's more of a passion fruit cream/curd that is encrusted with chocolate and topped off with a brittle, unsweetened chocolate tuile. It's tasty and it's one of the better birthday desserts I've ever encountered.All of these desserts were very ethereal. There's lots of foam. The textures are so light but the flavors are so intense yet it lingers on the palate for such a brief time. I had a foodgasm from this particular dessert tastings, while Ariel has found his content, peaceful place.When we asked for the check, they gave us a granite full of caraway raspberry cookies in tow.Innards of cookieI apologize for the blurry innards shot. It's tasty and very different. The spicy caraway seeds meets with the sweet, tart raspberry jam was an interesting flavor combination.Ariel was very kind to all of us by picking up the tab but then he lost his peaceful place and \"thought of his job\" because it left a small hole in his wallet.Addresses: Vosges Haut Chocolat 132 Spring St New York, NY 10012Esashi 32 Avenue A New York, NY 10009WD-50 50 Clinton St New York, NY 10002

Hooray! I'm glad you had an excellent time with your desserts at WD-50. It is my favorite.

I found your sushi photos on Flickr, and I was hoping they were from nearby! I will have to make notes of these places and check them out next time in the city.

stupendous as usual Tina.I really need to try WD-50.I was over at Eleven Madison Park recently, they served some wonderful macarons with dessert -and to beging, a savory variety made with fois gras.

Giulia: Oh, you must try both things/places! They'll change your view on sweets.Kathryn: Thanks for your suggestions on WD-50. It's just too bad that my dining companions weren't too keen on trying out the creamsicle...Christine: You should check Esashi out. It's pretty darn tasty sushi there.Doug: Oh thanks, Doug! You should go to WD-50! It's awesome...as you can tell from my review.Yeah, I saw your EMP photo at Facebook. Did I mention how adorable you and your significant other are? Anyways, I read their dessert menu that had macarons!  O.O Gah, I want them!Foie gras macarons...it's crazy enough for me to try it. I think Robyn mentioned that Pierre Herme makes that flavor...?

thanks ;) - i just eBlushed.I couldn't even taste the fois gras as it was masked by some type of fruit jam.I wonder if you could go to EMP just for dessert (perhaps after eating a burger at shake shack).

Doug: I think you can...since I did that to WD-50.In regards to the foie macaron, I guess Chef Humm is using the same idea as his foie gras appetizer: adding a fruit jam to foil the foie.

The reason that the Japanese beer tasted like Budweiser is because they both use rice as a primary ingredient.  Budweiser basically poorly imitates a good Japanese beer.

On Wednesday, I was craving for a burger for lunch. I don't know why exactly but I just want some juicy ground beef sandwiched in a good, soft hamburger bun. Since it's almost 12, I know it's going to be crowded to try Burger Joint since it's not a huge space to start with. (I know this since I visited the space but didn't try anything.) What I ended up deciding is to try Burger Heaven. You might be wondering why the heck would I try a small chain burger at all. Well, two of my male friends, Ariel and Dave told me that their burgers are awesome. Actually, to quote Ariel he said, \"The burgers are heavenly.\"I walked into this diner-like setting of a restaurant. Honestly, I didn't anticipate the particular decor but I don't really care since I'm just here for some delicious burger than anything else. I just asked for seating for myself but one of the waiters told me that I could just pick anywhere to sit. I just walked past the counter and toward the back where the kitchen's just off to my right.I ordered a chocolate milkshake and their cheeseburger special.Close up of the chocolate shakeThe shake was pretty big but since I'm parched, I don't really care about the volume nor the calories in there. Even though it might be close or past 1,000 calories by the time I'm finished with it. Anyways, the shake was pretty darn good. Just look at the photo below...It's thickThe straw did stood up on its own, so it's thick enough. The sucking the shake through a straw needed some effort but it wasn't as thick as Stand's that I had in February, where I feel like my lungs are about to give out from inhaling and my brain's about to explode from sucking too hard. In terms of flavor and texture, it's super smooth, creamy, and the chocolate flavor was fine. It's not intensely chocolate-y but it had enough chocolate.Then came my cheeseburger. When my server came with my plate, she asked if I want any tomatoes, pickles or lettuce to go with it. I replied no, since I just want the unadulterated burger. If it's good on it's own, it doesn't need any extras to make it taste better superficially.My burger and friesCole slawThe cole slaw also came with the burger. There's nothing remarkable about that slaw. It reminds me of the type my mom picks up at my local supermarket.Assembled burgerInnardsThe cheeseburger was dripping some meat juices, nicely pink, and it melts-in-my-mouth texture. It's fine but it doesn't taste as great as Shake Shack's burger. The bun is also the standard stuff one can get at any local supermarket. In other words, I like the texture and how they cook it to a perfect medium-rare but I want flavor and a better bun.For some reason, I wanted dessert despite killing myself with artery clogging food. Since I remembered that Kyotofu started serving soy milk ice cream a while ago, I stopped by to give it a whirl, sitting at the bar in the front of the place.Looking down the barEvery time I come to Kyotofu, I'm always mesmerized by their water glass. I don't know why but I have an odd obsession about how their glasses are shaped and how it captures the light...I need a new hobby or interest that isn't so weird.Soy & Tofu Ice Cream with Okara CookiesMacro shots of the dessertAs usual, the desserts look pretty. The chocolate soy ice cream was surprisingly tasty. I'm usually a skeptic about eating soy ice cream since I know it lacks the butter or milk fat that is usually found in cream and/or milk. But the ice cream was very smooth, enough chocolate flavor and it has a touch of creaminess.The Pulico ice cream, which I think it's spelled that way since the pronunciation was a bit skewed with her accent, but anyways this particular quenelle shocked my tastebuds in a good way. It was a very sour, tart ice cream. Almost like eating an unsweetened tart frozen yogurt but much softer and smoother. It's also a bit more creamier than the chocolate soy ice cream.On Thursday morning, I didn't eat breakfast at home and I had a hankering for pancakes. The only place that would have great pancakes in the city would be Clinton Street Baking Company.Interior shotIt was 8:30 AM and the tables are almost half full. Since I was hot (it's still 80 degrees Fahrenheit here) and want caffeine, I ordered an iced coffee.But since I know what I wanted, I just told my waiter that I want their famous (amongst New Yorkers) blueberry pancakes and that's what I've gotten after being patient for 10 minutes.My plate of pancakesPouring the maple butterAfter the pourI know I might be seducing some of you who love pancakes with the pouring of their delicious warm maple butter on top of a pile of steaming hot, fluffy, blueberry pancakes. Oh yeah, it tastes as good as it sounds and looks. Here's bit more pancake porn for you.InnardsI felt full after eating the entire plate. I almost wanted to try their scone or biscuit but I didn't do it because I know I'll regret it once I put my two feet on the scale the next morning. After that thought, it's scrapped and I paid the check.Clean plateI walked to Chinatown to burn a few calories off and pick up a couple of char siu sou for the Serious Eats crew. I don't remember exactly where I got them since there's a ton of bakeries in Chinatown that sells these things but I remembered the place, not the name.After classes were over for me, I actually dropped in the office to say \"Hi\" to everyone at Serious Eats (that would be Alaina, Adam K., Raphael, and eventually Ed) and give Robyn her birthday present. It's technically slightly belated just because she's in Toronto on the day of her birthday and yesterday was only time where my schedule would allow me to visit her. Once I've settled down a bit and chat with her, we started to take photos and nosh on the pork filled pastries.Robyn photographing the char siu souMy char siu souI know the pastry is not exactly photogenic since it was a few hours ago where I'm walking to and fro classes and roughing it in the subways but it could be worse. Anyways, this glazed, dense, flaky, lard crust based crust is filled with sweet and savory Chinese-style roasted pork. It's good but I wish it was heated or warmed in an oven so the crust would be crisp. Besides that this thing was a brick to your stomach. You can only eat one before you feel like you need a stomach pump or walk a few miles to feel a bit better.After we ate, Robyn unwrapped her present. For those of you who were paying attention to my Flickr photostream a few weeks ago, I took a photo of an adorable stuffed bear and said that it's for a friend of mine...well, that's Robyn. And here's her reaction.Without the use of captions, you can see her genuine happiness screaming at you from these photos. Seriously, I have never seen anyone that excited or happy like that in a looong time. At least she loves the bear. Yay for me. And besides her constant petting and hugging of her bear every ten minutes, she also played with his arms...take a look below.Yeah, she's beaming with giddy and delight.I spoken briefly to the great Ed Levine when he just entered and sat on the table eating his lunch. You know, I almost had the urge to bow down before him but I didn't do that before everyone would think I'm weird. Eventually we had a small conversation about the pizza and Chicago, just because I mentioned about Ariel's going out there for this Labor Day weekend and I asked where would be a great pizza place in Chicago. Ed's a cool guy, not as intimidating as I thought. Also, he offered some frozen custard from Kopp's since they had a TON leftover in their freezer from an earlier custard tasting back a month ago.Serious Eats' freezerThe great EdTo explain the above photo, what he's doing is stirring up the leftover Kopp's German Chocolate Cake custard by gently melting in the microwave the ice crystals that have grown in the pint. He offered me a cup and I accepted it.My cup of custardThe custard's delicious, no doubt about that. The chunks of rich, dense chocolate cake with flakes of coconut and nuts swimming (it's defrosted ya know?) in a pool of creamy, luscious chocolate custard. But I found it a bit too sweet for my taste.Eventually I left the office since my mom's expecting me home (I know, it's ironic and strange) and she wanted me to run a few errands before I get my butt home, so I bid Robyn farewell while she's carrying the bear like it's her newborn child. Aww...how adorable.Addresses: Burger Heaven 9 E 53rd Street New York, NY 10022Kyotofu 705 9th Avenue New York, NY 10019Clinton Street Baking Company 4 Clinton Street New York, NY 10002Serious Eats 242 W 27th St New York, NY 10001

That must be a great pancake place since they offer maple butter. I don't think I've been anywhere (home not included) that gives you maple anything.

Interesting, I have never heard of \"frozen custard\" before.
Is it bassicly ice cream or gelato with a higher egg content, or is it actually like a mostly-egg-based flan thats been schlepped in the freezer?

Christina: Clinton Street Baking Co. is one of the best places for pancakes in NYC. You must try it, if you have the chance!Casper: Really? Hmmm...Frozen custard is a type of cold dessert similar to ice cream, made with eggs in addition to cream and sugar. It typically contains 10% butterfat and 1.4% egg yolk (according to Wikipedia). It's really popular in the Midwest.It's very similar to ice cream but it's more smoother, thicker and served at a slightly higher temperature than ice cream. It's really delicious.

hey tina!
just catching up with your posts - i was at sullivan st bakery for breakfast this morning! had the raisin walnut and pizza bianca. i sampled the olive stick you had, and it was goooood, though i agree that it was far too heavy on the olive oil part :) also was at clinton st baking last weekend, had the same blueberry pancakes as you. i noticed that they put your blueberries to the side, but scatted mine over the time when i ordered it...
funny how we keep on going to the same places...i wonder if i'll randomly bump into you one day! :)

LG: Oh...thanks for clarifying that!Kathy: Yay! You're in NYC! May I plug in a \"finally, \" since I heard it from Robyn two months ago that you're coming in around late August?Anyways, I hope we can actually meet one day...I have a feeling it will be soon.

Yay!  It's a Snuffles Gund bear!  My wife collects those.  She has one that's almost as big as I am to hug when I'm on business trips.

School's back in session for me ever since the past Monday and that means I'm spending more time in the city eating out besides school and studying. And I took the eating portion a bit seriously this week since I felt depraved from the food scene since I was working and/or studying almost the entire summer in Queens. Ahhh...it's good to be back in Manhattan! Since a week is a lot to cover, I'm splitting this up into two posts for the sake of not boring you to death with my ramblings and not to let the post take forever to load up.Starting off the school morning on Monday, I contemplated a slight controversial debate I had with a bunch of loyal macaron lovers that I had a few posts ago and went back to Madeline Patisserie.Vanilla and Chocolate MacaronsThis time I just try the vanilla macaron and the chocolate macaron. The chocolate was a bit wetter than desired and mushy, as Robyn commented on my macaron post earlier. The vanilla was a bit drier but it's way to sweet for me. It reminded me of the pistachio macaron from Georgia's Bakeshop I had during the macaron hunt a while ago. I'm getting depressed for the lack of awesome, divine macarons. Please Monsieur Pierre Herme! Open a boutique in NYC! Please!I know it won't happen in a long while no matter how much I beg, plead, wish, etc. Anyways, I went to class and eventually it's my lunch hour/break. Since I don't want to write another post about Bouchon Bakery and go obsessive like I had last semester (and tried practically everything in their pastry case), I walked down to Sullivan Street Bakery.It's their bread bag; not the signI perused the sandwiches they have and I found out that they have their own interpretation of the Cubano! But they ran out. Oh pooh. So to at least satiate my craving for complex carbs and starches, I went for a slice of pizza pomodoro and a torino di ciccolato.That's some red sauceUpskirt shotThat's thin...This über thin, crisp pizza was pretty damn good. The tomato sauce was bright and acidic but had a sweet finish. Yes, the pizza could survive without the gooey, luscious cheese of any sort. The only thing I kind of wished about this pizza was that it's warm instead of room temp.Torino di ciccolatoInnardsThe torino di ciccolato was good. It kind of reminds me of a dense, chocolatey brownie but it had a slight char flavor from the edges and the breadcrumbs in it that gave it an unexpected toothsome texture. I would prefer if the latter two didn't exist but I guess it's their way of the brownie or a bouchon.As I munched my food, I kept staring at the pans of bread sticks they recently put out that I had the unusual urge to want to eat one. I ended up having an olive oil bread stick ($5) and it's really long.InnardsIt's about my entire arm's length long! This stick of bread reminds me of a super saturated (of olive oil) olive focaccia bread, sans the rosemary or any herb that normally goes in that particular bread. Every time I touch that bread or anything that touches it, has an imprint of grease and every little green olive you see on top of that bread has pockets of olive oil within each hole. Not like I'm complaining really but that's a lot of oil. In terms of texture and flavor, this bread is what you would dream everything you would want an olive focaccia-like bread to be: soft, light, a hint of yeast flavor, olive-y from the actual fruit and the oil, and crisp. Not bad for $5, but I couldn't finish it in one sitting so I saved the remaining 3/4 for dinner. I washed down all the carby goodness with a bottle of San Pellegrino Limonata. Mmm...very refreshing.San Pellegrino LimonataOn Tuesday, I organized (sort of) a meet up with my friends from St. John's later on the afternoon after my classes were over. But since it was 9 AM and I'm in the city, I want coffee. My caffeine dependent brain was telling me that I must have coffee before I will regret the consequences that will occur if I don't. So, for some reason I went to NoHo and stumbled upon Think Coffee.Think CoffeePeople love this place!MenusSTELLAInterior/seating areaThis coffeehouse is basically mere steps away from NYU, hence why it's so popular with NYU's coffee-lovin', arguably sleep deprived students who lug their Macbook and use Think's WiFi. When I got there, there weren't that many people as you see on the photo above. It's more like 7 tables were taken given the time was 8 AM. I ended up ordering an iced latte to stay, which had it's own price listing ending up to be $4.50 with tax. It turned out to be an average beer mug's size of latte. That's like a large and a bit more, if you had the normal coffee cup.To explain the STELLA photo, it's their house wine offered for the evening, since this place do serve wine and alcoholic beverages.Iced LatteIt's actually pretty good. The latte was cold and it had enough of that bitter, roasted espresso bite as the finishing note to every sip I had. My caffeine craving was satiated and truly appreciated the coldness of the latte. Refreshing.I didn't eat anything until the meet up at Adrienne's and that was around 3 PM by the time everyone showed up. Somehow coming down to Stone Street is such a difficult thing for most people who aren't familiar with the Wall Street area. I don't blame them initially since Stone Street is a tiny little nook of cobblestone that no one really pays attention to unless you're trying to get some good or decent grub that is found on this street. Anyways, after everyone finding each other and the constant calls know how to find Stone Street, we're there and I want to EAT.What we're here for...on the menuWe knew that we needed 2 whole pies to for the entire group and one of them has to be the Old Fashioned. The problem was the other pie. We ended up having a lengthy debate and discussion about what topping to go with the other one. What Bryan proposed was to use the method of deduction. Eliminate anything that anyone does not like and whatever remains, we take a vote. The winner was the sun-dried tomatoes and that's what's going to be on our pizza. Since we're waiting for the pizza for over 20 minutes, we killed some time by taking group photos of the table since we're sitting outside anyways.The girls: Giulia, Julie, and SeungmiStephanie, Bryan, Helen, and meAnd finally, the pizza has arrived!Old Fashioned Pizza picsThe Old Fashioned was pretty awesome. The crust was thin, yet strong enough to hold the sweet, acidic tomato sauce and the gooey, stringy mozzarella cheese. Oh this was good. I haven't had pizza in a long time but I think I like Grimaldi's more though and I still haven't tried Lombardi's yet. The problem is that the school semester started for my friends and they don't have any days off or long hours to commute over and eat with me.Old Fashioned Pizza with Sun-dried tomatoesMy slice of old fashioned pizza with sun-dried tomatoesUpskirtAnyways, the pizza with the sun dried tomatoes were somehow a bit wet. The crust can't really hold the sauce, cheese and tomatoes whenever I try to pick up my slice. It's strange since it's the same exact pizza but we just add a topping. It tasted good with the added chewy, sweet, slightly tart tomatoes but the mushy crust is the only thing that prevented me from enjoying this pizza.Then for dessert, we walked a few storefronts down to Financier Patisserie. But before we went in Fen called and said that she's on S. Williams Street, which isn't too far from Stone and she wanted to join us for dessert. Since we're waiting for her, Helen took my camera and took random, candid shots of the group without Seungmi since she's trying to help out Fen with directions on the phone.Bryan's playing aroundMy cheesy smile...it's another candid shotAnyways, Fen eventually found us and Bryan and Stephanie already got themselves dessert: a chocolate flourless cake. Seungmi eventually got herself a strawberry shortcake, while Giulia bought the passion fruit mousse.After taking photos of the aforementioned desserts, I went with Fen to peruse the pastry case to see what's good remaining and she asked what is good there. Somehow it nothing struck my interest especially with the fact that I had their macarons before. Fen on the other hand ordered the crème brûlée.Fen's crème brûléeThis is the only dessert I tried from the three that the others had since Fen ironically was very conscious of her calorie and fat intake and she's skinny and taller than I am. Anyways, the crème brûlée was fine. The buttery, pâte brisée crust meets rich, eggy custard with a hard caramel top. The caramel didn't seem crisp or brittle as if one was breaking a thin film of glass with a spoon. It's more like a tough, firm coating.Here's another set of candid (and a posed) shots in Financier.We all left afterwards since I have to go home to take care of my mom and school stuff. I miss everyone already. :(Go to the next post for Part 2...Address: Madeline Patisserie 128 W 23rd St New York, NY 10011Sullivan Street Bakery 533 W 47th Street New York, NY 10036Think Coffee 248 Mercer Street New York, NY 10012Adrienne's Pizza Bar 54 Stone Street New York, NY 10004Financier Patisserie 62 Stone Street New York, NY 10004

Kathryn: Think's iced latte is good. I just haven't tried their iced coffee even though I heard good things about them besides from you. I'll try it next time I'm there.Hillary: Heeheehee...I'm evil. I think? At least you're getting hungry instead of disgusted by the sight of my photos.Chubbypanda: Which pizza are you referring to? Sullivan Street Bakery's super thin, tomato sauce only pizza or Adrienne's cheesy, old-fashioned pizza? Nevertheless both are very good.

I know I haven't written in a loong time. It's not that I'm ignoring you intentionally, it's just that my life is flooded with a lot of drama that I don't want to go into depth. If you can recall recently about my mom being sick and all, she has been operated a couple of days ago and she's doing okay so far. She's just fatigued and a bit dizzy since she's been in bed for a while and the surgery has taken a bit of a toll on her. As I've said earlier I'm behind so I'll catch you up with the food things that happened since my last post that was notable.Back two Friday mornings ago, my parents and I went to Mt. Sinai Hospital to meet the surgeon and consult about what will happen to my mom and schedule the surgery. After that, I have to run a few errands in regards to school so I left my parents and walked down Madison Avenue. Somehow I was curious to about Yura & Company's food when I was about to pass by, and just dropped in to see what they have.Pastry counterPastriesEventually, I settled for a chocolate cupcake ($2) and a Parisian croissant ($2.75).CupcakeInnardsThe cupcake was very moist and slightly dense. I didn't really get much in terms of chocolate flavor or sweetness from the cake but it was made up from the frosting that topped it. It's good but not my favorite.Parisian CroissantBittenThe croissant would've been better if I haven't eaten this at 11 AM. It's light but the layers absorbed the pastry cream that it was a bit soggy. It's sweet enough to satiate my sweet tooth in a croissant since it's topped with powdered sugar, almonds, and that vanilla pastry cream. I like it in terms of the idea but I was disappointed in the soft, chewy texture.The important event of sorts that happened last weekend was that it's my younger brother's birthday. He turned 20 as of last Saturday. Since I'm a baker in the family and I do want to do something special for him, I baked him a batch of Boston Cream cupcakes. Why Boston cream? It's because of the fact that he loves the donut form and since I don't have the patience to make a yeast donut batter, shape it, and fry them I just make a cupcake version. It's less of a hassle to do so. The recipe I used was from Cupcake Bakeshop's blog, using the Martha Stewart's version of this cupcake sans the banana. Here's the photo of the finished product:Agreeing to what Cheryl of Cupcake Bakeshop said, the cupcake is dense than light and it did lacked character even though I did add an extra teaspoon of vanilla, it didn't really help it either. At least my family did enjoy the cupcakes, so no complaint there.My mom wanted to take my brother out for dinner just because he's leaving home soon to back upstate to Bingamton for school and for his birthday. Strangely, she picked out this Chinese restaurant in Flushing called Linden Place, where they did have dim sum back in February during Chinese New Year. I have never went there before since classes were still on even though it's my holiday of sorts. Anyways, this place looked nice but so...gaudy.Looking toward the dance floorNear the bar areaThe seating/lounge areaMy parents somehow liked the decor; thinking it looks upscale and grandeur. I just hope besides (being blinded with so much dramatic reds and gold) is that the food is good. My parents ended up choosing four dishes, most of them being seafood dishes.The sugar snap peas and seafood stir fry (it's not the actual name but it's what I can think of) was good. The vegetables, scallops, and shrimp weren't overcooked. The interesting ingredient in this dish was the use of mango. I thought the mango was a bit odd since the raw-sour flavor of the fruit was a bit too overbearing once I eat it with the other elements.Bowl of sizzling seafoodThe Thai Seafood Bowl came out hot and sizzling when the waiter brought it to our table. As much as I appreciate the fact that the food is a bit spicy (a bit too hot for my brother), I just hated the fact that the squid was overcooked. It felt like I'm chewing rubber.Seafood riceMy parents ordered what they thought was seafood stir-fried rice but it's actually rice with seafood on top since this particular dish was listed under the different types of stir-fried rice that restaurant offers. Anyways, this wasn't so bad. Nothing was overcooked and it's seasoned just fine.A plate of fried pork chopsThis dish above is basically a plate of fried pork chops (technically it's near the rib) mixed in a sweet and sour sauce. This dish is essentially what I have many times while I was growing up, whenever my family ate out amongst ourselves or with my relatives in a restaurant. Why is that? I don't know. I guess it's something that has to do with having the fried meat with a tasty sauce that is so appealing to every soul who is going to devour them. In case you're wondering, this dish was tasty but I wish the pork itself had more meat than bone.The dish you see above was almost the biggest disappointment of the night since this was supposed to be a flounder stir-fry. But as you can see there isn't much fish in there; it's just mostly celery with a few chunks of fish. It would've been better if we had known that this would cost less than $20, which was the price of this dish.FruitTo cap off our entire meal, they present us with the typical plate of fruit but it's pineapple and watermelon, and the sweet red bean soup (I didn't take a photo of the latter). Here's a few photos of my family and my dad.Fast forward to the past Friday, I visited my mom the day after her surgery and on the way back home I dropped in Dean & Deluca for no good reason. Honestly it's been a long while since I've been in any Dean & Deluca store. As I perused their goods, I ended up getting Baked's Salty & Sweet Brownie ($3.50) since I'm too lazy and I don't have the time to schlep all the way to Red Hook, Brooklyn to get my grubby paws on their baked goods.BrownieInnardsI'm really surprised how moist this brownie is. It's almost fudgey but not exactly fudgey...if you get my drift. The chocolate flavor was quite robust and the sweetness was highlighted by the salted caramel. Ooh, I like this brownie a lot. I just don't really like the fact that I have to shell out a bit more than three bucks for a brownie. I need their recipe.Then today, I visited my mom again but then went to the west side of the city to pick up textbooks for my classes since it's starting on Monday. I hate lines so that's why I ordered in advance so it makes my life microscopically less stressful than what it is already. Anyways, since I was early before my school's bookstore opened, I went back to my old standby, Bouchon Bakery and picked up their seasonal almond fig pound cake ($4.75) and a peach jam donut ($4.25) to go and eat at home.DonutInnardsEven though this donut has been braving through the muggy heat that New York is going through, this donut is texturally heavy to me. It's not really light, I tasted a hint of the oil that it's been fried in and the peach jam isn't that peachy. I'm a bit disenchanted.At least the almond fig pound cake fared a lot better. It's packed with a ton of dried figs, the cake was light and vanilla-y, and it's sweet enough. I would sum it up that Bouchon's desserts have its hits and misses after trying almost everything they have.A small note to the reader: I know those of you who have been reading this blog for a while know I'm obsessed with this place but I'm trying not to go there that often since this is going to be my last semester in college so I want to make the most out of it by not eating here as much as I used to.Addresses: Yura & Company 1292 Madison Avenue New York, NY 10128Linden Place 34-20 Linden Place Flushing, NY 11354Dean & Deluca 1150 Madison Avenue New York, NY 10028Bouchon Bakery 10 Columbus Circle, 3rd Floor New York, NY 10019

Well, whilst I admit that restaurant does have its fair amount of gaudy-ness, it is in no way a comparison to the modanna inn, especially since the food there looked, alright.
Gosh, I wish I could forget this plae but I pass it everyday.

Chubbypanda: Finally, someone agrees with me! I just can't bear the fact I'm surrounded by the flashy, dramatic decor. Too bad I don't own prescription sunglasses to take the edge off...Casper: I couldn't believe what you've just written before until I jumped to your link. The steakhouse is taking excess and gaudiness to the umpteenth exponent. I hope the food tastes good after being bombarded with all things flashy or possibly the visuals numbed out the tastebuds.

Baked is one of my favorite bakeries. Their velvet cake, mini cupcakes, chocolate chip cookie and coffee is very good. I usually go after I eat a lobster roll at  fairway.I went to Bucheon  a week ago since I had a hankering for sticky buns after watching Bobby Flay's sticky bun throwdown but was devastated to find that it was closed for vacation.

Kim: Oh, if Red Hook wasn't such a long trek I would've eaten quite a bit of their stuff by now. *sighs* I need a day off from classes in order for me to get there.Anyways, I know what you went through since I recently wanted to take a friend of mine who have never eaten Bouchon's bouchon before but it was CLOSED for vacation. We were disappointed when that happened. But they're definitely open now.On another note, I love Bouchon's sticky bun too! It's so freakin' decadent and gooey. Mmmm...I'm just getting hungry just thinking about that.

Oh no Tina you dont understand.
Not only is the madonna inn ITSELF gaudy but so is the
EDIBLES!
It truley is a foodie hell in every sense of the word.
It's even worse that they serve you portions that would make a Cost-co swoon.Please, please let me write no more, the mere thought pains me.

A Birthday Lunch at Asiate and Dessert at Dumbo

The past Monday, my friend Dave wanted to celebrate his birthday early since he's going down south to Florida during the actual time, so being a good friend I ate lunch with him at Asiate. Everything is so...pretty and elegant. The views of Central Park and midtown Manhattan is pretty awesome as well.InteriorReflectionWe perused the prix fixe side of the menu and eventually Dave decided to have the corn soup and the flank steak, while I have the smoked salmon risotto and the fish of the day, which turned out to be cod.The prix fixe menuDave's SoupMy risottoDave's corn soup with fried chickpeas, chanterelle mushrooms and wild rice cracker was quite delicious. The sweetness of the corn worked well with the earthy, savory beans and mushrooms. The wild rice cracker gave it some interesting crunch to all the chewy and smooth textures of the soup.My salmon risotto with nori seaweed puree, soybeans, shiso, and raw salmon, was quite interesting. It's not the typical risotto that I am accustomed to since the particular rice they used is not as starchy as risotto. The taste itself is smoky, almost bacon-y due to the use of smoked salmon and the seaweed puree imparted an earthy taste that I can't really describe. It's tasty but I wish I could describe it a bit more.Then our main courses arrived. Dave's flank steak with smoked potato puree, wild mushrooms, caramelized onions and meat jus was good. The beef was tender and the smoked potato puree tasted more like truffle oil was added in there instead. Nothing extraordinary but it's fine.Flank steakMy fish of the day (cod) encrusted with dry shrimp, sautéed broccolini, and English peas was quite delectable. The fleshy fish contrasted with the crisp crust. The shrimp flavor wasn't dominant to the cod but I don't really see why it's added.My cod fishWe chose not to have dessert there but we took the subway downtown and walked across the Manhattan Bridge to Dumbo. Yep, I went to Brooklyn for sweets.View of the Brooklyn BridgeWhere did we go to? Since Dave was craving for a cold drink and I wanted ice cream, the only place that I know that would be selling both would be either at the Brooklyn Ice Cream Factory or Jacques Torres. Since we were a bit pooped from walking over the bridge, we went for the closer destination, Jacques Torres.Tree of chocolate lollipopsOnce we entered the shop, Dave ordered an iced mocha. I paced around the store twice to really make up my mind what do I really want...chocolate, chocolate chip cookie, or their ice cream sandwich? Since I was craving for something sweet, creamy, and cold, I went for their hazelnut ice cream sandwich ($5) and their frozen mocha hot chocolate ($4.50).Looking in my cup of frozen hot chocolateAfter I paid for my desserts, I asked one of the girls behind the counter if they have a knife or something that could cut the ice cream sandwich in half. What they did have was a butter knife and she started to cleave it away...Thankfully, it was a success and I could share it since this sandwich is huge and I know I can't finish this in one sitting after a two course meal.InnardsLike I remembered having it (almost a year ago), the chocolate chip cookie still managed to be a bit crisp despite being in the freezer for more than a few hours, chocolatey, and the hazelnut ice cream was dense but creamy and it had a hint of roasted hazelnut flavor. This is a nostalgic dessert but nevertheless it feels decadent since it's so big.The mocha frozen hot chocolate was cold, there weren't any large chunks of ice while I'm drinking it (which is a good thing), and it was quite chocolatey. The problem is that it was a bit too bitter and grainy from the cocoa they've used. But it's not bad.That's pretty much my day out with Dave...so Happy Birthday Dave!

John: Asiate does have a prix fixe lunch...but I guess it's a kept secret. ;)Casper: Where are you from Casper? (If you don't mind me asking.)Anyways, no I don't eat like this everyday before I'll go broke (and die sooner than I need to); maybe once a week or every two weeks I do. I don't mind showing you around the city if you visit NYC.

Currantly, I live on the west coast.
San Luis Obispo, California. It's kinda like a little big city, we have our nice restaurants and things here and there. But you can only go around so long before you feel like you've tried it all.
It's a nice sort of tourist area, especially if you check out nearby Santa Barbara or something.
Thanks by the way!!

Is the prix fixe lunch all year round or just for the summer?
thewanderingeater

G3B: It's year round, I believe. Their summer prix fixe menu (3 courses for $24.07) was over the week before I went there. But you may call ahead to find out.

I love reading your blog esp looking at all the pictures. It makes me want to eat everything you show and describe.I live near Jacques Torre and never knew they had an ice cream sandwich. I usually have their hot chocolate or their chocolates.I probably frequent Almondine across the street a lot more since I love the almond crossants, pretzel bread and their delectable sandwiches.
thewanderingeater
2007-08-22 16:12:00
Kim: Thanks! :)Jacques Torres has been selling ice cream sandwiches for the past year or so but usually during the summertime (unless they changed it to year round, but highly doubt?)Almondine is a great bakery. I never had their pretzel bread though. Recently they're selling crepes and SUNDAES! I like the latter more than the former.

That Is Some French Macaron...

For the past week I went to Madeline Patisserie in Chelsea since I remember reading recently from the NY Times that they sell macarons (Please don't confuse them with the coconut macaroons; this is the almond meringue based cookies sandwiched with ganache or buttercream, ok?); one of my multitudinous food obsessions and my hopes to find a good one in NYC that doesn't suck. I went here on two separate occasions. Why? Because from my first visit there, it was they were still baking it and the weather was crummy.Madeline Patisserie (taken on the second visit)Le MenuOn the first visit since the macarons weren't ready, I ended up doing was have breakfast there by having their plain, regular sized croissant ($1.85) and their tiny, bite size chocolate chip financier (35 cents).My breakfast and its innardsLooks enticing, no? Unfortunately, as I've mentioned earlier that it was raining, the dankness made my croissant soggy and chewy. At least it tasted buttery and slightly light, if was a nicer day this might have been a pretty damn good croissant. The financier (it's a French almond cake, traditionally made with almond flour and shaped like gold ingots) was very moist, buttery, and had a hint of almond flavor with miniature bits of chocolate chips. I really liked that financier that day since the croissant was a bit disappointing.Here's a couple of interior photos of this place. It looks really charming, like an eclectic French home with a bakery section. I can imagine myself lingering here for a couple of hours leisurely reading a newspaper...that's if I had the luxury of time.Seating areaTeaware on display windowThen on my second visit, on the morning of my friend Dave's birthday lunch (a post on that in the very near future), I was adamant on trying their macarons. But since I was hungry and didn't have any breakfast (yes, again) I ended up having a mini chocolate croissant (90 cents) and a pistachio madeline (75 cents)...as well as four macarons ($2.50 each) which will be discussed later.My madelineThey had four madeline flavors that morning: pistachio (I ate and you see above), vanilla, chocolate, and chocolate chip. I just wanted pistachio since I didn't want to go chocolate overdose and pistachio is sometimes a hard flavor get it perfect. Anyways, this madeline was really delicious. It's moist, buttery, light, and it has a good hint of pistachio flavor that it doesn't taste artificial. Yummy.It's cuteInnardsThe mini chocolate croissant fared better that day since it's really nice, sunny, and hot that morning which equates to good croissant baking weather. The croissant was a tad crisp on the outside. Soft, slightly chewy, and buttery on the inside with two sticks of good dark chocolate possibly around 72% cocoa content. It's pretty darn good for something under a dollar.Inside my box of maccies!Group shots and innardsThe four macaron flavors I bought were Verger (Pear, Apricot, Mirabelle, Plum, Red Currant), Fleur d'Oranger (orange flower extract), Coconut, Blood Orange, and White Chocolate, and Argumes (Mandarin, Orange Zest, Cointreau, and Bergamote) out of the possible twenty-five or so they make according to the friendly French woman who helped me behind the counter. All of them were gratifying to my macaron deprived palate. These macarons are much bigger than any macaron I have ever encountered so far; they're about three inches in diameter. The textures of the macarons are generally much lighter: the thin, crisp exterior meets a very moist, light cookie innards. They are sweet but not cloyingly so and the ratio of cookie to filling is enough to satiate my filling loving tongue.But I should note, not every macaron tasted equal. The best one was the coconut, blood orange and white chocolate since it was the most moist, and the sharp acidic bite from the blood orange was the perfect foil to the sweet white chocolate ganache. The fleur d'oranger was the driest of the bunch but it tasted good nevertheless.Now I kind of wish that they open another patisserie near my school just because I can have a macaron a week (if I can refrain myself from not buying more than one per visit) and be in my happy macaron-lovin' mood.Here's a couple more photos of their pastries they offer but I haven't eaten yet.The Patisserie's CounterA silver tray of macarons!My Mom's and My Thank Yous...I want to thank all of you who actually wished my mom well. It meant a lot to her when I showed and told her the previous post and its comments about your support. She did say, \"Thank you.\"It also brought warm, fuzzy feelings of love for you all since you mean more than just my readers, I feel like I'm telling you a very small part of my life, even though this is a food blog but hell, it my blog and I have to put in some personality behind all the food I eat. So, THANK YOU! and I virtually hug every one of you...Address: Madeline Patisserie 128 W 23rd St New York, NY 10011

WE LOVE THE MOTHER WHO SUPPOSED THE WANDERING EATER!  ;DI checked out Madeleine today but the macarons made me...kind of perplexed and sad and something.  Like I JUST DON'T KNOW.  Maybe I will write about it later.  They tasted grossly underbaked, something that could be easily correctly (unlike overbaking).  Maybe your's were different....wah!...and a customer in the bakery recommended we get the pistachio, but it wasn't that good.  -__-
thewanderingeater
2007-08-18 05:27:00
Robyn: Really? Maybe you had a bad batch or something... I'm perplexed too. Which one did you have?I just hope it's the aforementioned before I'm really going to lose hope for macarons in NYC and get myself to Paris once school's over.

Pretty much all the ones we had were like..uh..mega moist.  .__.  Tried strawberry, vanilla, the wine flavored one, pistachio, cassis, an orange one, the lemon/chocolate one, a hazelnut one...I think I ate too many.I don't think they were really bad (rather have it moist than dry), but I was just annoyed cos I felt like they could've been a lot better.  Some flavors were too sweet without the flavor.  The texture...THE TEXTURE...WHY IS IT WET AND KIND OF MOOSHY.

2007-08-18 17:36:00
Louis: Oh I have tried LMDC's macarons a while ago. They're great but I just want an alternative choice.Laudree's coming to town! O.O I'm going there the moment it's opening...that's if the rumors are true.Robyn: I do find their macarons moist. As I think about it a few were a bit sweeter than preferred but seriously, you didn't have that ethereal thin crust on that cookie? Methinks I should go there whenever I'm back in the city and give it another try to prove or disprove my current opinions.
Robert Brown
2007-08-19 00:07:00
I generally concur with Robyn (Are you Jacksonville Robyn)? The pistachio and dark choclate macarons I had were heavy-handed, too sweet and heavily overweighted to the interior. My shopping companion also thought they were underbaked.The croissant I had lacked the shattering experience of the outside and the buttery, multi-layered interior as opposed to the breadiness\" of this one. The only good France-like csroissant I have had in the city were the Sarabeth's I used to buy at the Butterfield Market, though I haven't made a concentrated exploration of croissants in Manhattan. When I'm downtown, I will stick with Claude.
thewanderingeater
2007-08-19 05:32:00
Robert: I have not tried either the pistachio or dark chocolate macarons (probably I should now?). But I do concur with you in regards with the croissant lacking the shatter that I was so obsessed with almost a year ago when I attempted to look for the best croissant in NYC. Claude's croissant is very good but I find them quite heavy even though I love the shatter.

I took one look and could not deal with the bumpy imperfect surface on their macs :(
I ran out of the store so disappointed...
NEW YORK needs a good MAC badly!
I found them visually unappealing and I can't eat things that don't please the eye, much less paint them, which is of course most of what I do...painting I mean, rather than eating..ahem.
(I wish...)
I felt they were a wannabe French shop :(
Too sad
Robyn (not from Jacksonville)
2007-08-19 20:55:00
There was a thin crust, but it wasn't ethereal.  I mean, in a sense it should've been, but...meh...euh.  I felt like it broke apart too easily so that moist chunks would possibly fall out when I bit into it or broke it in half...MACARONS, OHH THE MADNESS.

2007-08-19 22:13:00
Carol (aka Paris Breakfast): New York definitely needs a good mac...and that should be PIERRE HERME! Why doesn't he open one?! WHY?!Anyways, yes the place looks cute and it is teetering towards French kitsch.Robyn: Jesus, I really have to try their maccies again before there will be a never ending debate about this...except it'll be another week or so 'til I get back to the city since classes start then.Who knew that one simple (yet divine) cookie can turn out to an all out war?

I'm glad that our comments perked your mother up. Just because you post a food blog and (virtually) non of your readers, myself included, haven't met you in person, dosen't mean we can't connect with you.

We can't wait to try the macs at Madeline Patisserie, the very next time we're in the city!  But here's a hot tip for anyone who ever finds themselves in upsate New York.  Mrs. London's Bakery and Cafe in Saratoga Springs is world-class!  The macs there (chocolate, pistachio, and passion fruit are the best we've had anywhere-they don't make them every day (only when the weather is just right!), and while that can be disappointing, there's always plenty of great stuff to choose from.  Plain, almond, or chocolate croissants-all fabulous!  Very much the real deal, along with a full line of other delectable pastries!Mrs. London's (http://www.mrslondons.com/) is worth a weekend trip up from the city!  Enjoy...
natalia
2007-12-22 00:15:00
I think the reason why the macs didnt taste as good as you expected was cause you bit into them as soon as they came out the fridge....they are better when eaten at room temp cause.  When they taste too chewy its because they are extremely fresh...they need to \"age\" a bit....
PS: no one flies macs from france, thats insane....the cost of makin macs is less than the shipment.

I am a regular at Madeleine's (and a dessert fanatic). I find them to be a nice neighborhood  patisserie, but doesn't compare to La Duree or Pierre Hermes.You may want to try the macarrons at Boule Bakery on Duane and West Broadway, but there is nothing like the real French thing. And yes, La Maison flies them from France and if you ask they will tell you which days the shipments arrive.  I also heard that there is something to do with the water and flour used in Europe that gives their pastry a different taste.For Croissants in midtown, try Country Restaurant on 28th and Madison. They are pricier but just perfectly delicious! You can get a baket of 5 pastries for about 12 bucks. They don't normally sell to people that are not eating there, but if you ask they will do.Enjoy!

2008-01-18 20:15:00
Andrea: I've tried Bouley's macarons before and I'm not too thrilled with them. La Maison's the closest to Pierre Herme's.Hmm...the Country Restaurant for croissants, eh? I might try it someday. Thanks for the tip!

I have now become an avid macaron buyer at Madeleine's. Actually  some time before reading this blog! I haven't tried any other thing but the macaron's (I've looked at them many times at Notcot's Tastespotting, and never tried them). Now I've got my mother addicted to them, though from reading above that they aren't close to the real thing...when I go to Paris myself and have a batch of real ones, I'll definitely write a blog about it lol.

I apologize for not writing for a while, even though you see the photos from my Flickr photostream on my sidebar and the page itself, it's just because I'm busy with work, studying for LSATs, and now my family is going through a rough time because my mother's seriously ill. I'm just writing to you guys now for the sake of not focusing on my mother's situation and keeping myself sane. So, here's what happened on Monday, when things were generally mirthful.It's been an awful while for me to have a real day of fooding. What I mean is that I went to more than two places for the sake of food or drinks in one day. Where have I been to? Just read on.During the morning, I went all the way to the Upper West Side for the sake of cookies. You might be thinking, \"Cookies for breakfast? You must be nuts!\" Well, for me there is no time restraints for the sake of sweets. Think about it. Some of us eats donuts, muffins (which sometimes taste like a cupcake), chocolate croissants, or danishes for breakfast. How can you tell me that eating a cookie is a ridiculous idea? Anyways, I went to Levain Bakery.The home of cookie goodness...I seek shelter in this bakery since it was starting to rain lightly and thankfully they do have some seating inside. As I mentioned before I got myself a chocolate chip walnut cookie ($3.50). I know you think shelling out $3.50 for a cookie is ridiculous but you haven't eaten a cookie like this in the city. It's so gooey, chocolatey, packed with walnuts, and it's so soft and chewy since it's barely baked. It's like eating an underbaked cookie that is baked...if you get my drift. I hope. Seriously, if you're a woman who's undergoing PMS, this will totally satiate that craving we all have during that time.COOKIE!Split into two...Gooey...I ate only half since I know I'm going to have lunch with Doug and Helen at Bar Stuzzichini within a few hours. Eventually Helen ate a piece of this later on and she understands how this cookie could almost be considered the ultimate chocolate chip cookie.Moving on, we all met at Bar Stuzzichini almost noon. Surprisingly, we were the first group of people to eat here, or at least seated but eventually there are more diners around 1 PM.Bar Stuzzichini & Interior photosThey do offer a prix fixe lunch for $20 but we were interested in doing a la carte. After we ordered, we were given the bread and condiments...and Helen took random photos of the place with my camera, but Doug's portrait survived from my photo editing session.Bread and CondimentsIt's Doug!Eventually the stuzzi (as the waiter kept calling them) came in 10 minutes later. Stuzzichini is an Italian word for small bites or snacks that is meant to be served with wine; think of it in terms of Italian style tapas.3 of the 5 stuzzi shown...Tiny apps...As you can tell from the photos, these appetizers are tiny. Sure, they're small plates and they can be shared but when I had my multiple tapas experiences from Alta and Salud, the portions were a bit more generous (well, maybe not Salud but you get the point). At least they were tasty and the main theme going on for all of these plates were tender (meant for the octopus) and light (everything else). The best of the five stuzzi (polpo (grilled octopus), arancini (fried balls of risotto), polpette (meatballs), crostini di ricotta pecora, and crostini di ceci) were the polpette and the polpo. The others were good but it didn't tantalize my tastebuds when I was eating them.After we finished our appetizers, it took them a looong to get our main courses out. I kept glancing at my watch wondering where the heck is our food and Doug's boss called him soon enough that I felt awful for holding him back because of the slow service. But after waiting patiently for 15 minutes, our sustenance finally came out.Doug's SandwichhalvedSandwich innardsDoug's chickpea fritter sandwich ($9) was pretty good; slathered on both sides of the sandwich bun with ricotta cheese. The chickpea wasn't dense and somehow there's fish in it. Strange. The negatives on this sandwich was the characterless, seedless, untoasted bun and I think the sandwich overall lacked seasoning.Braciole Alla PizzaiolaInnardsHelen's Braciole Alla Pizzaiola (short rib; $13) looked like something an Italian grandmother would make. It's so rustic and simple in presentation that it looks like from a home kitchen. This short rib is basically a soft, slow cooked, boneless slab of beef drenched in thick tomato sauce. It was well seasoned but it's really simple in terms of flavor.My GnocchiMy Gnocchi all Amatriciana ($14) was very good. It's very light and not gummy. The tomato sauce was well seasoned with bits of onions and guanciale. I still think it's a bit too safe, flavorwise but it is satisfying.We have to skip dessert since our lunch took way too long for Doug to stay since we technically stayed there for almost two hours...and it's not even a three course meal. Eh, I think Bar Stuzzichini has fine Italian food but for the sake of our time and the price for the food, I might not go there too often.Helen and I are left to ourselves and hang out for the rest of the day. We have the plan of seeing a movie nearby and we ended up deciding to watch Bourne Ultimatum. I admit I haven't seen a movie since Memoirs of a Geisha (I know, I've been living in a cave), it would be something Helen and I could waste our time and be entertained. We have another hour to until the next showing since it was playing by the time we bought our tickets, so we walked over to the East Village for some ICE CREAM!Dessert time!Yep. I took Helen to Sundaes and Cones for dessert since it's so hot and humid on Monday. Helen and I perused the myriad of choices of flavors they offer and eventually after trying the lychee and corn ice cream; I just went for a cone of corn. Helen was craving for green tea.Mmmm...cornGreen TeaWe're HappyMy corn ice cream was awesome! It's creamy, not too sweet, with tiny blended bits of corn. Trust me if you like corn, you will like this frozen, dairy based form of corn. Mmm... Helen's green tea ice cream, though I haven't tried hers (but I ate it before) seemed very good since she seemed like a happy camper.After we finished our dessert, we headed back to the movie theater in Union Square and watched Bourne. For the inquiring minds, I think the movie was ok. I really liked the action sequences but everything else besides that didn't really intrigued me. Oddly enough when we're about to leave the movies, Helen was craving for coffee. My insane, caffeine-dependent mind sparked the thought of Joe's.Joe!InteriorWe both ended up ordering a large iced coffee since it's still humid and hot. Helen being Helen, she bolted to the counter where they have all the different sweetners and lids for the drinks and she found her true love...liquid sugar (aka sugar syrup). So she shook, poured, and poured the sugar that it amounted to a seventh of the volume of that coffee cup. Yep. She loves her sugar.She's happy cuz of sugar!We found ourselves a table in Joe's, sat down and sipped our coffee. But when she tasted her coffee, Helen wasn't satisfied with the sweetness level of her coffee. Yeah, can't you believe it? She got up and added a couple more dashes of sugar syrup until her sugar-lovin' tongue is content. It's hard to believe that I'm still friends with her even though she's destroying the concept and integrity of great coffee.Once we're finished with our afternoon coffee, we went home since the skies are threatening for rain and I have to do my typical evening routine...studying.Addresses: Levain Bakery 167 W 74th St New York, NY 10023Bar Stuzzichini 928 Broadway New York, NY 10010Sundaes & Cones 9 E 13th St New York, NY 10003Joe: Art of Coffee 95 E 10th St New York, NY 10003

Well Tina, first off I must say best of wishes and regaurds for your mother, I know it can be hard to deal with a situation like that in the family. But, certainly looks like you had the best of times out. I totally understand your frustration with Helen though, being myself a fellow coffee lover. (You know its too sweet when you can't taste the roast, damnit!) And that Ice cream sounds so interesting and divine, I had some fantastic tiramisu and some sweet cream and chocolate gelato last night which was quite interesting. I loved how the captured the flavour of Tiramisu so closley that I could taste the textures of the flavour!
Keep eatin'!

Chef John: Thanks! Nice to meet another foodie as well. :)Casper: Thanks for your condolences. Yes, it's been a good time. I wish I did that more often. Ooh! You had gelato! I love gelato. It's the stuff of dreams. I'll be eating a good bit once my classes start in less than 3 weeks.Ahonag: Sure!

Hi Tina,The small plates were quite good, but you're right about the \"characterless, seedless, untoasted bun\" - that might have made a big difference on the sandwich. Overall, it was good for what they were attempting -  something akin to eating a cloud (it was so light and fluffy).It looks like you guys had a lot of fun after I left :PHope your mom is doing alright and that the studying is progressing. ttys.

Doug: Every component on a sandwich sums its  possible greatness; it would've been a better sandwich if the bun  was at least toasted.Yes! Helen always make fooding a heck of a lot more fun than...eating for the sake of eating.Thanks for your sympathies.Carol: Thank you for your support. :)

I'm sorry to hear about your mom!  :(  I can't imagine what I'd do if my mum were sick... ....FALL APART AND GO INSANE, really.  I assume she will never get sick, but I can never really know...(goes paranoid)...Anyhoo, I ate a Levain cookie for breakfast once.  Totally fine.  Yeeah.  YEAH.  Yeah.  I like how you caught the meltingness of the chips.  :DYou wouldn't wanna see what I do with coffee.  .__.  But even with sugar, I don't like it that much.  Wah.Helen's hair looks cute!  And...um, that means Helen looks cute.  Yes.

Robyn: Thanks for your sympathies. I don't think you need to go to paranoia but it's true, it can happen to anyone, anytime.The best part of that cookie was the melting chocolate chips, besides being soft, chewy and delicious. :)SO what do you do with your coffee? If you go beyond sugar, it's just the milk part...which something Helen doesn't mind having in strong coffee actually. Eeek.Helen's funneh, odd (in a good way) and adorable. Yep that's her.

I hope your mom is ok. Best Wishes.

I love Joe's coffee! My bf works a few blocks from there so it's very convenient for me to sit there with a yummy cup of coffee while I wait for him.

Wendy: That cookie was divine. I would've eaten the entire cookie but I need stomach space for lunch which took place three hours later...Thanks for the well wishes.Wonders: I think there's a cult following for Joe's. I know I'm not the only food blogger who loves his (as in Jonathan Rubenstein, the owner of Joe's) coffee.

Coffee Houses, Bakeries, and a Birthday Lunch

***CONTENT
For the past two or more weeks, I've been going in and out of a few bakeries and coffeehouses just because I love them...and the fact that I'm waiting for my Restaurant Week lunch reservations to kick in sooner.I went to my first (coffee) love Joe (the one in Union Square), since it's been ages since I last went there. I always pass this tiny shoebox size of a bakery that is called The Adore. I didn't eat breakfast the morning when I was going to Eleven Madison Park, so I went in and got myself a croissant and walked over three stores down to Joe for a cup of coffee, their Coffee of the Week, Indian Mysore.CroissantInnardsJoeMy cuppa joe...The croissant was ok. It's light and buttery but not much in terms of flaky or crisp. The coffee though was awesome. It's a very smooth, full, rich bodied, with a nutty flavor.Then a few weeks later, I went to Billy's Bakery to try out their peanut butter and chocolate chip cookie that I saw from Smitten Kitchen's Flickr photostream and brownie.Interior of Billy'sBrownieCookieInnardsThe strange thing is that if you compare my cookie to Deb (the Smitten Kitchen), it looks so much flatter and not sugar encrusted. The initial thing that I've noticed that is very good is the fact that my cookie was fresh from the oven. It's warm, gooey chocolate (as you can tell with the streaks of chocolate), not exactly intense peanut butter flavor as I had those tiny peanut butter cookies from City Bakery, but it's pretty good though.The brownie was moist but it wasn't fudgy as I would like it -more like an intensely moist chocolate cake. The chocolate is fine but I rather stick with Bouchon Bakery's bouchon that I had months ago. Hmm...too bad Bouchon isn't open until August 15th.Then the day of Ariel's birthday lunch at Aureole (more on that later), I went to Grey Dog's Cafe just because a lot of New Yorkers claim that their coffee is good. As a java junkie, I have got to try at least a cup...and their sweet potato cranberry muffin since I wanted to have a light breakfast.Grey DogA line of peopleInterior of seating areaBreakfast time...Close-up of my muffinMacro of innardsThe coffee was fine. It's not as bold or strong as Joe's but it's better than say, the corner deli's coffee. The muffin was a winner though. It's interesting to find sweet potato in a muffin, honestly I don't think I ever had a morning pastry that incorporates sweet potatoes. It's moist, sweet, with a lovely crumbly cinnamon topping, filled with finely grated sweet potatoes and dotted with a nice ratio of dried cranberries. Me likely.Then later on the afternoon, as I said earlier, I had lunch with Ariel at Aureole, to those of you who have been reading my blog for the past two weeks or so knows that I've been there recently. Some of you might be asking why go there again? Well, since it is his birthday and he said he wanted to go there for years, I thought to myself, \"Why not go there, again?\" So I made reservations for lunch and entice him to come on time by buying him a drink. I'm not going into details of the food since I found out that the menu's practically the same as the last time I went here with Robyn, Helen, and Giulia.Ariel's prize for coming on timeUnfortunately, I don't remember what's the name of the cocktail, all I remembered was that it cost me $8 and it's made with blueberries and elderflower liquer.After we ordered, the bread was the same except they also served breadsticks.Pretty breadsticks and the buttaMy bread plateAriel and I ordered the Chilled Corn and Lemongrass soup with coconut mousse with lime oil.The soup was good but I tasted mostly the salt, then the corn's sweetness with the faintest breath of lemongrass as the finishing note. I like it but I wasn't swooned.For the main course, Ariel had the chicken breast with potato puree, glazed vegetables, herb jus, and I had the market fish of the day (which turned out to be hake again) served with couscous, olives, roasted pepper coulis.Ariel's Chicken dishMy fish dishAriel's chicken was moist, the vegetables were tasty but the dish overall seems...banal. I know that Restaurant Week doesn't entitle a diner to have the restaurant's normal menu since one is charged with a small amount of money but at least they can make the food a bit more interesting.My hake was not as wonderful as last time. The seared part of the fish was soft, not crisp as it was last time, and it seemed a touch overcooked. The couscous was pretty much one-dimensional for me, the only intriguing factor was the use of lemon zest.And finally, we have dessert. Ariel had the chocolate terrine (it's the same one I had last time) and I had the New York cheesecake. Strangely, when they brought out our desserts, they thought that we wanted the other supposed thing, hence the explanation of the photo below.Happy Birthday!After Ariel blown out his candle, we swapped plates and ate our dessert. What Ariel thought of the chocolate terrine was that it was sweet but not to the point that it's unpalatable and he thought that the caramelized plantains was actually the most intriguing and the best thing in that dessert. My sentiments were the opposite in regards to the plantains but we all have our own likes and dislikes despite we're both foodies.He's tucking in the dessertMy cheesecake was tasty. It's smooth, dense, and creamy. The crust portion is basically the thin sugar cookie that is resting on top of my cheesecake. It's pretty much something I could make at home in terms of taste and texture. The only difference is the fact that I normally wouldn't think of adding tiny cubes of watermelon with the berries as well as having watermelon juice or consomme (as Aureole puts it on the menu). It's nice but not very captivating.My cheesecakeTo sum it up, Aureole during the extended portion of Restaurant Week was a disappointment but at least the food wasn't completely awful; it just didn't titillate my tastebuds (or Ariel's, as we discussed our meal afterwards). Thankfully, I'm not planning to go there anytime soon since I have other places of interest.Addresses: Joe: Art of the Coffee 9 E 13th Street New York, NY 10003The Adore 17 E 13th St New York, NY 10003Billy's Bakery 184 9th Avenue New York, NY 10011Grey Dog Cafe 90 University Pl New York, NY 10003Aureole 34 E 61st Street New York, NY 10021

The lovely part about living in a big city is the many coffee shop options.Funny about the lemongrass, I was out with my mom last week and I ordered lemongrass chicken. She tasted it, wrinkled her face, and said it reminded her of the lemon-scented Pledge of her youth! I didn't agree.

Since I've wrote to Robyn recently via e-mail about my horror of yesterday at the LSAT and wanted me to express the dreadful experience of what happened. So, here it is (if you don't really care about my babbling about the LSATs, just scroll down 'til you hit a food photo):The LSAT people emailed me (and all test takers) that I cannot have these items with me at the day of the test: a handbag, purse or backpack; no electronics of any sort (i.e. cellphones, cameras, beepers, iPods, etc.), weapons (that's a duh), rulers, and other odd stuff. The only thing I can bring is a gallon size Ziploc bag containing my wallet and ID, my keys, the admissions ticket (strangely they want a thumbprint, that's done at the site), pencils (but mechanical pencils are not allowed), highlighters, a snack, bottled water or beverage, and erasers. In case anyone who didn't pay attention to the email or the lengthy note when they've sent the admission ticket via email or their website, they did have a coat check room that someone did watch over (even though they kept stressing earlier that it's unsupervised).I arrived at the Pavilion around 8:20, after stopping by Starbucks for more coffee (I know, it's everything I'm against but Joe doesn't open 'til 10 on weekends!). A huge line formed outside of the building that some cars passing by the street, a woman asked, \"What's the line for?!\" Most of us screamed back, \"The LSATs.\" But some guys sarcastically say, \"We're waiting for some TV audition.\" Or something along those lines. The security guards eventually let us into the building to go up to the 4th floor, where we all wait on another line to get checked in. That's where we sign our names on the admission ticket, get our thumbprint taken and tear off the stub to write down our LSAT number for form filling. After checking in, they have someone to escort each person to their own seat in this huge, stark white room. Three long tables across with oh, twenty to thirty rows of tables toward the back, not too far from the bathrooms. It took about an hour and a half to get everyone checked-in and seated.The head proctor (there were two other people as proctors as well) made the usual announcements about regulations and instructions about the LSAT and how to fill out the stupid forms for ten minutes and let us fill out the forms for another ten to fifteen minutes. Once all of that stuff's done (and the A/C started to blast on), the test began; 3 sections, 35 minutes each, 25-28 questions per section. They collected the stuff, which took about 20 minutes, then we had a 15 minute break, which for me, waiting on line for the women's bathroom took up the majority of the time. Then they distribute our tests back which took about another 20, and we had to work another 2 multiple choice sections of the aforementioned and then an essay for again, 35 minutes.After the essay portion was done, they collected the stuff, separated the answer and question sheet, and counted them to make sure they have the same number they started with. Then they dismissed us! The actual test takes 210 minutes or 3 1/2 hours but the checking-in, collecting, counting, etc. took up the majority of the time. I'm just happy I'm out of that refrigerator room. Everyone was complaining that it's freezing from the other girls, guys, and then I heard the head proctor mentioning that at the end of the test. But the bad part now is that I think I'm sick again, after just recovering from my previous cold three days ago. Whoopee...Now you know what I've been through...wasn't it lovely? Jeez, I really hope I did well before I really want to shoot myself. Anyways, here's another backtrack of last week's food. I know you care more about the food than my problems...I think? As I review my photos, I really didn't eat out that much compared to the previous week but it's still tasty nonetheless! Note that I'm going to write about The Spotted Pig on the next post.Last Monday, September 24th, somehow I was craving for Scandinavian food. Since the Scandinavian food scene is severely limited in the city, the only places that serve that particular kind of food are at Aquavit, Fika (a coffeehouse in Midtown that I've yet to try), and I heard about Smorgas Chef. As you can see from that list, it's severely limited. So being the planner that I am, I made reservations at Opentable for my lunch hour and gone to Aquavit Cafe.I remember reading from NY Magazine a few months ago about their \"Cheap Eats\" issue and mentioned somewhere that their smörgåsbord is relatively cheap for the gourmet end of food, which I ordered and coffee crème brûlée for dessert.Somehow, the unexpected thing while I was eating my bread, was the arrival of a plate of grilled tuna salad. The server told me that it \"was compliments from the chef.\" I was really befuddled. Sure, I went here a few months ago for Restaurant Week and the waiter was different from the last time (this time was a waitress) and I doubt they knew I was a food blogger beforehand since I didn't take any interior photos since I took it the last time I was here. But I got over the whole shock of it all and ate it.The tuna was grilled to the point where it's still raw in the center that it's silky. The salad itself was really tasty, the onions and tomatoes were tart and sweet at the same time with the bitter leafy lettuce leaves that topped off salad. Yummy. The portion itself was quite small, but it's a nice starter/appetizer.Bread and butterGrilled Tuna SaladThen my huge platter of smörgåsbord came out. It's basically a plate of little bites of most of the stuff on their lunch menu. Just click on the photo for the labels of each item. The herrings were very delicious: tart, a hint of sweetness, and generally a complex layering of flavors. As the last time I've (or quoting from Ariel) said talked about their herring, \"It's hard to believe that a humble fish can be so tasty.\" The other bites consisted of pate, shrimp salad, salmon tartare, smoked salmon, gravlax, Swedish meatball, and other stuff. My favorite \"bite\" was the gravlax because of that lovely espresso mustard with that salmon, oh my goodness that combination was sublime. The slightly sweet, espresso kick in that mustard was so silky smooth and the silky, sweet-salty salmon worked so well together.A plate of SmörgAnother viewI felt full after eating that plate of smörg but I must eat dessert, the coffee crème brûlée.Coffee Crème brûléeThe crème brûlée was pretty good. The custard was very smooth and creamy, with enough coffee flavor to contrast all of the sweet eggy custard. The burnt sugar crust didn't do much for me since it's more like sticky, hard crust than brittle and glass-like. The raspberry sorbet was a bit unusual to pair the flavor with coffee but I guess it's more like trying to give it some sharp, tart berry flavor to go against the custard itself.During the evening of that lunch, I looked over at my Opentable account and noticed that I'm a recently minted \"VIP member.\" Maybe that's explanation of that freebie tuna salad, methinks?On Thursday, I went to Frankies Spuntino for a late lunch. Since it was around 2:30, the place was empty. But I heard from this place numerous times that they have great pasta, so I gotta try it!FrankiesInteriorOlive Oil and BreadAfter perusing their menu for a few minutes, I ended up ordering their cavatelli and red wine prunes for dessert.CavatelliTheir homemade cavatelli was made with Faiccos Hot Sausage, browned butter, and sage. It tastes like it's description. The chewy, fat, rippled pasta was delicious with the buttery sauce with the meaty hot sausage and its fat drippings, the musty, minty flavor of the sage, and the salty, pungent bite of the Parmesan cheese on top. Mmmm...tasty. And it was quite filling.Red Wine Prunes - close upBut then again, there's always room for dessert. The red wine prunes was not what I thought it would be when I read the menu description but it was still very good. The warm, spicy (one of the wine notes I've tasted), reduced red wine sauce fused with the dried prunes contrasted with the cool, creamy marscapone cheese. A bit artery clogging but still yummy.Then on Thursday, I had lunch with Eno at The Spotted Pig, which you will read in the next post.Addresses: Aquavit Café 65 E 55th Street New York, NY 10022Frankies 17 Spuntino 17 Clinton Street New York, NY 10002

Terrific photos and descriptions as usual! I did have a question though: Is the smorg available in the main dining room or the cafe or the lounge?

haha, you make me want to take the LSATs! Something about collective misery....The cavatelli makes me think of worms for some reason. But your description of it is simply DELISH. And I'm so glad prunes are finally getting a fair shake at upscale places.

Kathryn: Thanks!Dana: Uhh...ok? You can take it but it's a very odd reason to take it for the sole purpose of enduring misery.Actually, I thought the cavatelli looks like slightly squished worms but it was YUMMY.Doug: I'm glad it's over, too! Yay! I could party! ...Well, not really since I still have school but it'll take down the stress level just a notch or two.Good luck on your GMATs!

ziplock bag...escort to your seat??  Ooofah...Anyway...great pics from Frankie's.  If you make another visit, the sausage & broccoli rabe sandwich is a must.  Also, I highly recommend Alias which is just 2 blocks up on Rivington.

I love tasting plates, since I prefer variety in my meals.  All I really need are a few bites of each dish.  Probably my Chinese heritage speaking up.

I'm Back! Also A Recap of Two Weeks Ago (Part 1)

Yay! I'm done with the LSATs...just oh, a little under 7 hours ago (approximately 2:30 PM, NY time it was over). I have to say, whoever took that test has my sympathies since that was the worst testing experience I ever had in my life. Seven hours stuck in the same building (the Metropolitan Pavillion in Chelsea for me); the same stark white, frigid (temperature-wise) room with over 100 people taking a freakin' test for the aspiration of becoming a lawyer. Jesus, I hope I did well before I'll have to shoot myself (mentally), pay another $123, and do it again in December 1st. I really don't want to do it again and go through that torture. Despite the fact I still haven't filled out my law school applications yet...UUGH! The paperwork never ends.Well, I survived the past week fairly well despite being sick for a little more than half of that week (that I mentioned to you on the last post) and managed to lose weight unintentionally. I guess stress does that to me... So, back to what this blog's mainly about: FOOD. I'm going to talk about what I've visited and eaten back two weeks ago starting on September 16th. Jeez, that was eons ago!Back on the 16th, I went to Bouchon Bakery. I know, I know...those of you who've been reading this blog for more than five to six months, think either I live in that place and/or eaten everything in that cafe. I don't blame you for thinking about those thoughts since I've written about them...22 times! Oh crap...but I was lazy to haul my butt to somewhere else and I was hungry so I went there to eat. I've tried a few new pastries they had at that time: a Apple Puff Pastry Danish and a Pesto Croissant.I tried the apple puff pastry just because it's sweet. In case you haven't noticed, I have a penchant for sweet stuff so that's why I ate that first. Besides the fact that everything from Bouchon is so darn pretty and photogenic, it tastes as good as it looks. The puff pastry was buttery and über flaky. The vanilla speckled custard that is cushioning under that pile of diced, sweet, slightly tart apples was the best part. I think I rolled my eyeballs to the back of my head good.Apple Puff Pastry DanishInnardsThen onto the unusual, savory pesto croissant. I have to admit, I would never thought of putting pesto in croissant but my culinary imagination is not as expansive as Chef Thomas Keller, hence why I'm not a chef at all. Anyways, the croissant's texture is not what I would want it to be. It doesn't have that symphonic crackly, brittle shard-like sound that I dream of (like Monsieur Claude's in the West Village does). It's more soft and chewy, yet buttery. But the Parmesan sprinkled exterior and the pesto, pignoli swirled within that croissant was very intriguing. The salty, sharp, pungent, slightly nutty cheese with the peppery pesto was a really great contrast to the chewy, buttery croissant.Pesto CroissantInnardsThen that Thursday (the 17th) I was maniacal enough to schlep myself out of my house in Queens and get my butt to Lincoln Center about 7:45 AM. Probably right now you're thinking, \"Are you (as in me) NUTS?!\" Yes, I love Yo-Yo Ma or any classical musician. And...the concert's free but it's a dress rehearsal though for that evening's concert.PeopleMore people...The nice things that happened while I was waiting was the fact that Credit Suisse (they recently signed a contract to sponsor the NY Philharmonic for the next several years) gave out bottles of water and chocolate. The chocolate was mediocre at best since I thought it tasted a bit chalky, but their intentions and the action of giving free chocolate were really nice. Even when I waited for the Metropolitan Opera tickets last year (for Madame Butterfly dress rehearsal), they didn't give anything.The chocolateBottle of H2OMy ticket! ...and other stuffSo waiting on line stinkin' early paid off...I got meself an orchestra seat and a discount for a future concert, which I'm contemplating about getting one as a present for surviving the LSATs now and probably drag someone along. Anyways, the concert's great and seeing Mr. Ma in action was beyond anything I've imagined. He's just magnificent, that's all I can say.The stage at Alice Tully HallMusicians warming upAfter the concert, it's already past 1 PM and I was starving. Since I'm already in the Upper West Side, I thought of eating lunch and probably snack around the area since I'm there. For lunch, I went to Tenzan.TenzanI've heard about this place many times that this place has pretty good sushi for the UWS that doesn't cost my bank account, i.e. MASA. Their lunch specials have the typical Japanese dishes like beef teriyaki and the like but I wanted sushi and it costs me $12.95 with miso soup or salad. Since I know the general idea that the miso soup is disappointing in NYC, I just went for salad. The salad was ok but somehow it's dressed with a dressing that looks like \"French\" dressing from a bottle. It's orange and it tasted slightly sweet like that bottled stuff. Hmm...I'm not expecting to be swooned by a bowl of greens but at least it's not drowning in a pool of dressing.SaladThen my platter of sushi arrived minutes after I finished my salad. The first thing was that I haven't expected to have a huge plate of sushi! It's almost the size of my sushi dinner at Esashi back in July with Ariel and Seungmi...but anyways, the sushi's fresh, it's tasty but it didn't blow my mind how awesome it is. It's just generally good sushi and it's very filling.Sushi LunchBeing the kooky person that I am, always wanting some type of sweet or dessert, I realized that Alice's Tea Cup was just a mere block away from Tenzan and wanted to have some tea and scones since I never tried their's before.Alice's Tea CupAfter perusing their tea menu for a good couple of minutes, I wanted something fruity so the \"Symphony\" sounded appealing to me, as their menu indicated that it's a black tea flavored with strawberries and chocolate.My pot o' teaCup of SymphonyThe tea had a really strong, lush scent of strawberries. When I actually took a sip of the tea, it tasted like slightly sweet strawberries but I didn't really taste any chocolate. It's good but it would've been interesting to taste chocolate in tea.Then my plate of scones arrived. I ended up choosing a raspberry chocolate scone and a pumpkin scone.Plate of sconesThe pumpkin scone was really delicious. It had enough pumpkin flavor with enough spices like cinnamon, cloves, and ground ginger to make it all tasty. The scones itself is like a true scone: dry, slightly crisp exterior, with a dense, crumbly, slightly dry interior. However, when it comes to the raspberry chocolate scone, I just didn't like the pairing of a berry and chocolate together, even though I know I don't like that combination in the first place, I just can't help trying to make myself like it. I just like the texture but not the flavor entirely.And just like I didn't have enough dessert, I wanted to try Beard Papa's fondant au chocolate. I don't know what driven me to eat that much that day, but I did and I heard that that particular item was yummy according to a few foodies and Ariel's keep mentioning that \"it's awesome\" for that price. So I had to try it eventually and I made that day the day to eat it.Beard Papa'sFor $1.85 (or something like that, I remember it's near or under $2), it's pretty good. It's gooey, chocolatey, and not too sweet but sweet enough but it didn't really rock my world. I think they microwaved the cake a tad too much since it had a slightly strange off-taste.The fact that I feel like my stomach's about to explode from all of the food I've eaten earlier, I think it's the reason why I can't really appreciate this cake.Fondant au ChocolateInnardsOn Wednesday, the 19th, I came to the city hours before my first class in the morning started, so I wanted breakfast. Since I haven't eaten at Balthazar before, I might as well try it for breakfast since people have talked about the fact that their breakfast scene is not quite as hectic as lunch or dinner but it still has that bustling, loud, SoHo scene.BalthazarPartial view of InteriorAll I ordered was their bread basket and a bowl of cafe au lait. Usually, I don't like cafe au lait (because I don't like milky coffee) but since this is Balthazar and I kind of wanted that French bistro type of breakfast, I might as well go for that route.My bowl of au lait arrived first and as I expected, it was milky. Even though I might get a slight hit of caffeine in my system from this huge bowl, I still don't love it but I liked the fact that it's a \"French\" thing to have in the morning.My bowl of au laitThe plate of jams and butter was served to me five minutes after having my coffee. No sight of bread yet... The jams were grape and orange marmalade and the butter is well, unsalted butter.Jams and butter for breadBut finally, I've been graced by the presence of the Le Painier. Holy crap, that thing is huge! I wished I had another person to eat with me...but obviously I don't so I had leftovers and I did share my bread with a neighboring diner who loved their bread. Anyways, this basket was again, plentiful for one person to eat. It's filled with brioche, a fruit focaccia, sticky bun, two slices chocolate bread, and four slices of a hearty fruit and nut bread. All of them were very good but my favorites were the sticky bun and the fruit focaccia.Le PainierSticky bunInnardsChocolate bread and fruit and nut bread slicesFruit focacciaOn Thursday morning, I went to City Bakery for a late snack (it's right after classes). Just because I was in the area and I wanted to try their plum miso muffin that I remember seeing when I was there the past weekend with Kathy.Lemonade and Plum Miso MuffinThe lemonade tastes like old-fashioned lemonade. It's quite tart, lemony and barely sweet enough that you don't feel like you're drinking straight up lemon juice. It's very refreshing; almost made me feel like I want to lazily lounge in a backyard porch staring out into the summer sky.The plum miso muffin was interesting just from the name. I would never imagine miso would be in a muffin. Even the combination of plums and miso was mind boggling. Anyways, the muffin itself tastes like whole wheat with a touch of that salty, miso tang. Texturally, the muffin was a bit dense, a tad dry and buttery (from the grease stains on my paper plate). The addition of tart, soft plums kind of takes away the balance of the miso for me. The tart plums was a bit too overbearing for the muffin.Plum Miso MuffinInnardsThat's the end of the week one of the recap, unless you want to include Saturday, that'll be the previous post about Kampuchea. Food from last week will be written very soon, that is after I get some sleep now. Yes, after getting only 4 hours of sleep last night since I was so nervous about the LSATs today made me tired and I think I'm getting sick again after freezing my butt off in the testing room for 7 hours. Don't I love my weak immune system and my hectic sleeping schedule?Addresses: Bouchon Bakery 10 Columbus Circle, 3rd Floor New York, NY 10019Alice Tully Hall at Lincoln Center 30 Lincoln Center Plz New York, NY 10023Tenzan 285 Columbus Avenue New York, NY 10023Alice's Tea Cup 102 W 73rd Street New York, NY 10023Beard Papa's 2167 Broadway New York, NY 10024Balthazar 80 Spring Street New York, NY 10012

I'm not much for the scene at Balthazar but whenever in Soho I must fight the urge (many times unsuccessfully) to enter the restaurant as they serve one of my favorite desserts in NY (even with Ceci-Cela and Pinkberry just a block away). So when I get the urge I either grab a bar table or a bar stool and order the banana tart served over ricotta ice cream. This dessert is to die for. The bruleed bananas over light custard on what seems to be short bread with the ricotta underneath for wonderful contrast. I could eat this every day. PS. this is my first time at your site and am very impressed. Keep up the good work!

As the title says, I can't stop writing and taking photos! Oh why? Why have I succumb to the addiction of BLOGGING? This is bad even though I should stick my nose to my books...and I think I'm getting sick since I got this weird itchy feeling on the back of my throat (uh oh). I just hope I don't get sick since LSATs are in less than one week! Ok, enough of my dramatic, rambling antics and I'll just talk about Kampuchea since their food is so very good and I'm skipping everything else I've posted pics of on my Flickr photostream for the past week. Are you confused? Yeah, so am I but let's get to the food!Since today (Saturday), I don't have classes and I needed a break from studying, I commuted from my house to the Lower East Side in the rain, to Kampuchea Noodle Bar. Why? Because I heard so many good things about it, from Robyn (on this particular post) to Ariel (the dude who's been eating out with me for quite some time).Plate settingInteriorBar/Kitchen areaInterestingly enough, their glassware of choice is a handled Mason jar.Water mug and carafeAs I perused the menu, the items on the menu that grabbed me were sweetbreads and crispy pork belly. My two meat obsessions, if you will, at the moment. So, those were my \"appetizers\" since they are supposed to be shared hot plates and an order of Num Pang (sandwich) tastings. No, I didn't eat with anyone since the two aforementioned people are out of the country at the moment (Robyn's in Italy; Ariel's somewhere in Russia/Eastern Europe) and it's more like a spontaneous craving that I want to eat here that I can't find anyone to eat with me. Oh well...more food for me.MenuThe first of the appetizer that came out was the crispy pork belly. The first thing I noticed was the peppery scent of the coarse ground black pepper that is sprinkled this dish. It tasted very delicious. It's crisp on the outside and chewy and tender on the inside. The wonderful sweet and sour flavors mingle well together from the apple cider vinegar and honey, and the breath of freshness from the lemon grass. This was a great starter.Crispy Pork BellyThen came my seared sweetbreads. Instead of having shiitake mushrooms, indicated on the menu, it's replaced with enoki, which in my opinion, changes the flavor of the entire dish. Shiitake has a more meaty, earthy, intense flavor while enoki takes on a lighter, subtler taste. But anyways, these sweetbreads were but very good. It's salty on it's own, but balanced it's off with the broth and vegetables; seared to perfection with a bit of char on the outside and still a bit moist on the inside. It's topped off with a mound of julienned lemon grass, carrots, pieces of fried garlic and topped off with a basil leaf, to impart a fresh, mint-like flavor. The broth was mushroom based (not too sure what kind) and it's spicy from the ginger and Thai chile. It's good but it didn't make me feel like I had an epiphany.Seared SweetbreadsThen last but not least, my plate of Num Pang Tasting, in other words, a plate of three different sandwiches. The three I ordered were their namesake, the Kampuchea, the grilled skirt steak, and the sweet pulled oxtail. All these sandwiches are very similar to a banh mi (since Cambodia and Vietnam are neighbors). The Kampuchea tasted like the banh mi but better quality and much more expensive than what you get in Chinatown. It has head cheese, pork pâté, carrots, cucumbers, and the usual condiments of a banh mi. The only difference is that I actually tasted something cheesy. Hmm...but it's tasty though.The grilled skirt steak was arguably the least striking of the three since it's just pieces of spicy steak with the banh mi condiments sans the head cheese and pâté.My favorite of the three was the pulled sweet oxtail. It's sweet-sour with a touch from the tamarind cooked with the oxtail. Oh, I love that sauce that oxtail was cooked in...To summarize the sandwiches, it's a bit pricey but it's worth it. After eating almost all of those sandwiches (I have so much space in my stomach, ya know?), I felt stuffed. I paid the check and get my butt back home to study. Yep, my life is mostly boring...and I need a darn vacation like Robyn or Ariel are having at the moment.Mmm...sandwichesAddress: Kampuchea Noodle Bar 78 Rivington Street New York, NY 10002

wonders: Technically no because I ate all of my apps but not all the sandwiches (I can't finish 1/4 each of the Kampuchea and grilled skirt steak sandwiches). But arguably I ate everything...yeah. Go me. And everything's yums!Me? Tiny? Probably I would consider myself \"average\" (in body weight/size) but most people consider me petite since I'm short (I'm 5′ 3″).Carol: Thanks! :) I need all the luck I could get...

good luck on your lsats!  I was checking your blog consistently even though you said you weren't going to update, and today I was rewarded with a pleasant surprise!I like that you eat upscale and downtown. It's an interesting mix not found at too many blogs.

Lunch at Marrakesh and Brunch at August

I haven't seen Kim for the longest time and really hang out with her. Why? Because of the chaotic meet up that I had back in July for the South Street Seaport concert didn't suffice as hanging out since we greeted each other, talked for ten minutes and broke up into our own little groups when the concert started and the crush of the crowds left us to our own. That was cruel and I lost my voice that night...Anyways, I made arrangements to eat lunch with Kim the past Thursday for two reasons, the aforementioned and because I won't be able to make it to her birthday party due to LSATs (oh the pain!). Since I don't really eat in the Midtown East area, I let Kim pick a place to eat for lunch, where she led me to Marrakesh since she's craving falafels and she said they make a good one here.MarrakeshIt's actually in the basement of the building where we have to walk down a set of stairs, which brought us to an exotic, Middle Eastern decorated restaurant. They let us choose our own table and we sat near the windows for the sake of good lighting.Me near the windowsKimmy!Anyways, after perusing the menu for five minutes or so, Kim ordered the falafel platter with hummus and baba ghanoush with lemon tea, while I have the kefta platter with tabouleh and grape leaves and Turkish coffee. While we wait for a while and chat away the time, what I didn't expect was a feast...Kim's Falafel PlatterMy Kefta PlatterBasket full of pitaMy Turkish CoffeeKim soothed by the scent of tea...Holy cow! That's a lot of food...trust me, the platter is a lot larger in life that I couldn't finish the whole thing. There's a few reasons why. I don't really like my tabbouleh because it had too much parsley that I felt like I'm eating an herb salad than tabbouleh and I tried some of Kim's baba ghanoush, hummus and falafel.My kefta was tasty, it needed and I used the lemon to bring some bright acidity to the earthy (albeit slightly dry, if eaten without the lemon) lamb. The grape leaves were fine since it's stuffed with rice and herbs but I wasn't truly enamored with it. The pita bread was tasty and warm, and I made a sandwich with the pita.Falafel with a touch of hummusInnardsKim's falafel was pretty good too with that touch of hummus. It was crisp on the outside, soft, moist, and packed with lots of herbs in it. Mmm...yummy. Her baba ghanoush tasted like it had yogurt in it or something dairy since it had a tangy flavor which was odd. Her hummus was the better of the side dishes since it's really thick, creamy, and a bit nutty in flavor.In regards to our beverages, Kim enjoyed her lemon tea and I liked my Turkish coffee. My coffee was thick, strong, sweet with a touch of spice. Though I like my coffee without sugar, I would think of this as my dessert coffee.After hanging around the place for good hour or so, I walked her back to her office and left her.Then yesterday, I met Kathy for the first time. I've been reading her blog for the past year or so and it's actually great to actually see her in person. We planned to go to brunch at August (which I have to make about statement later on). Since we met earlier before August was opened and Kathy was craving for \"liquefied food.\" Since she's not a coffee fanatic as I am, I thought of City Bakery. Yes, the home of the ever so awesome hot chocolate.City Bakery!Since it's about 10:15, not everyone in New York would be up on a Saturday morning so City Bakery isn't so crowded and hectic as it usually is during a weekday. We decided to split a regular cup of hot chocolate since we don't want to spoil our appetite for our brunch at August, even though we were tempted to try their miso plum muffin.Hot ChocolateAs usual, their hot chocolate is ridiculously decadent. It's super creamy, smooth, thick...it's like drinking a slightly thinned out 60% chocolate pudding. If they made something along the lines of 72% cocoa content, I'll be in heaven.Once we've finished our hot chocolate we walked over to August.AugustOk, so here's where I stop. I cannot go further with August because of a promise I made to Kathy, which she made to for newly acquired friendship with Chef Tony of August, that I do not want to ruin. If you want to see the food photos and little tiny blurbs of my thoughts on the food we ate, please click here. All I would have to say is that the food is so freakin' delicious at August! Go there for brunch, lunch or dinner! I want to try their blistered peppers but they don't have it for brunch. Darn...By the way, Chef Tony's really a cool guy in person and Kathy's a really fun person to hang out with, so don't hate either of these great people! You have no idea what you're missing out.  Another note is that I am not going to write for the next two weeks due to LSATs. My fear. My dread. I'm really afraid... Anyways, I'm going to post photos on my Flickr photostream, if I do eat anything intriguing but once LSATs over and done with I'll write an epic of a post to make it up to you guys.Addresses: Marrakesh 235 E 53rd Street New York, NY 10022City Bakery 3 W 18th Street New York, NY 10011August 359 Bleecker Street New York, NY 10014

hi tina - not blogging about a restaurant because the chef doesn't want food bloggers writing or reviewing his food is CENSORSHIP.chef tony liu is an excellent chef who had 2 stars from the times for august and it's a very popular spot, so i don't understand why he doesn't want either of you to blog about his food. whether it's false modesty or fear is irrelevant, no chef has the right to dictate whether people can blog about his cooking. it's one thing if a chef doesn't want his personal close friends to write about his food due to conflicts of interest or bias, but that is not an issue in this case for either of you.your acquiesing to this sets a bad precedent for food bloggers, and reduces your credibility as a reviewer.my bestjo jo

JoJo: Point taken. However, since Kathy knew him fairly well from the gist of the conversation we had about Chef Tony Liu. I don't want to ruin her relations to him and respect both of their wishes.But, I am doing a \"back door\" review via my Flickr link above. Sure, it's not so comprehensive as I usually write but you do have a sense of direction of what I am saying from the photos' comments: The food's fabulous. The service is good (though not mentioned in the photos but I'm telling you now). The atmosphere is rustic and homey, and you must go there whenever you have the chance!

\"your acquiesing to this sets a bad precedent for food bloggers, and reduces your credibility as a reviewer.\"i don't think that this is true at all, blogging is truly a personal choice (one writes what one wishes) and your credibility lies in all the amazing reviews you've done in the past and will do in the future. i think that this at the very least gives you more credit as a person who respects others at a basic one to one level, whether food blogger, chef or neither. i can't imagine why a chef wouldn't want you to blog about their food, but it sounds like you're being gracious about it whatever the reason is and i'm sure it's appreciated (i can imagine how hard it is to restrain from writing about such great food!) i guess i don't think it's so much about our 'blogging rights' as it is about respecting not only a chef, but more importantly a person's wishes, so i think you're right on track.p.s. keep up the beautiful pix! i love them not only from a food standpoint but from a photographic one too :)

Hey Tina!Thanks! I would write it all out, but I think the comment from 2 cents says it better then I possibly could :) It truly was an awwwwsome brunch, hehe. It is not b/c Chef Tony doesn't want his food to be written about (as I personally have nothing but good things to say about it!), but I think it was the circumstances, as the day before was the first time I met him - I'd rather my relationship with him be a friend/good customer rather than a 'blogger'. See you soon at the PORK FEST! teehee :)

2cents: Thanks in many ways from your comment! :)Kathy: I guess it's best to keep your relations with Chef Liu good and well. I just don't want to be the spoiler. Eventually if I get to eat there for dinner, I'll get those blistered peppers! I'm dying to try them.I will definitely see you at the PORK FEST! OMG, the pork...I need to fast a few days before that event occurs. Seriously.

As promised from my previous post was my lunch at Tia Pol with Ariel. I originally picked out this place for two reasons: I haven't eaten tapas for lunch before since there are not that many restaurants serve it for lunch. The other reason is because of Yumondo; I need something trendy and ethnic kind of place to write about before I officially sign off from my temporary position there. Since tapas is meant to be shared and I don't know anyone who would leave work for a good hour or so for the sake of food (and not get fired), Ariel's my guy.Tia Pol...not opened yetAs usual, I'm early to meet Ariel, even though he already postponed the planned time, I just killed some time taking photos of the place and observe the place.Tapas menuMenu of the dayInteriorWhen Ariel finally graced his presence and discussed about what the heck we would eat, since I'm not willing to order the entire menu, I let him pick three of the five plates.Piquillos rellenos de ensaladilla rusaPiquillos rellenos de ensaladilla rusa was the first dish that we have tried. It's quite good and rustic, or very \"homespun\" as Ariel calls it. The sweet roasted red piquillo peppers stuffed with a chunky potato and pea salad, topped with imported white tuna. The center is garnished with a crunchy watercress salad to contrast the sweetness of the peppers with a peppery flavor.Pulpo la idealThe next dish was pulpo la ideal; a Galician-style octopus terrine. As the photo indicates, it's a small serving and it costs $14. I found this dish not worthy of $14 because of the fact that the octopus is overcooked. It's like chewing on paprika flavored rubber. The spheres on the right are potatoes, which were fine but nothing much to write about.Garbanzos fritosI have heard so many praises about the garbanzos fritos from Chowhound and even Frank Bruni himself. What do I think of these fried chickpeas? Well, I think they're fine. It's like eating fried peanuts but a lot smaller and crisper, with a nice hit of paprika and the flavor is slightly nutty. Probably it needed a touch more salt but it's does not induce an epiphany for me.Bocata de loma adobadoThe bocata de loma adobado sandwich was probably the best dish. It is also the best value for $9 since it's very filling. The sandwich is built on Tom Cat baguettes (which are arguably one of the best baguettes in the city), filled with gooey, creamy tetilla cheese, sweet-tangy piquillo peppers, and the slices of fried, juicy pork loin worked so well together.Caracolillos barrio chinoThe final dish was caracolillos barrio chino. In other words, periwinkles, Chinatown style. Yes, I know some of you are turned off by the idea of eating snails of any sort and honestly, it's my first time trying sea snails. And I should warn you, this particular dish is meant to be shared among friends or someone you don't mind being a bit of a slob (in other words, not for a first or second date)! Here's why.When the server arrived with the periwinkles, he told us a technique to extract the snail's meat from its shell. It goes like this: take a toothpick (it was provided) and insert toothpick into smaller opening of the snail and push to loosen the flesh from the shell. Remove the toothpick from that hole and suck at the larger end of that snail. Hopefully you've loosened the flesh enough to get it into your mouth or you'll be having a good time digging out the snail out. Frankly, it's better to do the suction way because seeing a snail naked is not exactly what you want to see. Except for the fact that Ariel found it very intriguing that he wanted me to take photos of it and send it to him. If anyone knows or can insinuate what his intentions are with those photos, please let me know.Ariel with his snailEdit: I forgot to mention what does periwinkle tastes like. Well, it's not my favorite thing to eat since it has a slightly bitter note toward the end of masticating it. It's gingery and has lots of scallion minced in it, hence the \"Chinatown style\" and it's a mess to eat, as I mentioned earlier.My overall impression of this place is that it serves good tapas, obviously some hits and misses but it's a great place to hang out with a bunch of friends and have wine and tapas or a casual date (sans the periwinkles).Address: Tia Pol 205 10th Avenue New York, NY 10011

Periwinkle isn't my favorite either, but it can be quite nice from time to time.  I like it in the Vietnamese dish Bun Rieu Oc.

I know some of you who have visited my Flickr photostream, I've put up photos of Tia Pol before Big Booty Bread but I'm saving that for another post. So, here's another round of food.Last Saturday, I went to brunch at Resto. You might be wondering, why the heck do I want to go to a Belgian restaurant for? I just wanted to try their burger since I've read many publications indicating that they have an awesome burger that is on par with my beloved Shake Shack burger.RestoInteriorSurprisingly, it was pretty empty. But I should note that it's 10:30 AM on a Saturday morning, so I shouldn't expect any early risers on a weekend. Anyways, I somehow wanted to get a drink. And I mean a framboise mimosa. I'm guessing the school life is killing me and coffee is no longer wanted at that moment. Also, I ordered my burger.Framboise mimosa with water glassBurger!Burger innardsThe framboise mimosa was good. Nothing particular to note except that it's bubbly with subtle hints of raspberry. My burger was quite delicious, even though it's cooked to a medium-well. It has a beefy flavor, juicy, and the onions, pickles, and lettuce that accommodated this burger made it tasty. It doesn't beat Shake Shack's burger to the dust but it's better than Burger Heaven. Their frites or fries were thickly cut, so it's not very crisp but at least it tastes fine.FritesAfter class was over, I wanted to snack on something and have tea accompanying it. So, I thought of going down to Sanctuary T, since this place has recently opened and I read little blurbs about this place in the NY Times.Sanctuary TInterior at the back, toward the barPeople in back of mePastries at the barAfter seating myself at a table near the front, I perused their extensive tea menu and was interested in the Red Moon Tea. My server suggested their best selling iced drink, the watermelon lemonade. It sounded interesting, so I have that as well. I asked him for suggestions for dessert or sweets to go along with these drinks. He looked at those pastry display (on the photo above) and he said, \"Try the meringue. If you don't like it, we'll work something out for you.\" So, here I am bestowed upon a plate with an almond meringue.MeringueBittenTo tell you honestly, I don't like meringue cookies that much. Macarons are a different animal, so you can't fit this particular argument on me. It's something about that dry texture that kills my palate. Me and meringue cookies are not meant for each other.My waiter returned and asked me what I thought about it, I told him honestly that \"I don't really like it.\" He said, \"You don't? Well, how about a brioche?\" He gave me a dish with a brioche. He also asked me if I want to finish that meringue, besides that bite you see on that photo, I said, \"No thanks.\"BriocheInnardsWell, the brioche fared a lot better. It's sweet, light, buttery, and it has hints of orange throughout that bun. It's good but I don't really feel brioche-y. I just managed to eat the smaller half.My waiter returned with my drinks, the watermelon lemonade and the Red Moon Tea.Watermelon LemonadeThe watermelon lemonade is a misnomer, in my opinion. It should be named watermelonade since I don't taste any lemon whatsoever. Besides that, it's a delightful drink. It's cold, tastes like watermelon in a not-so-sweet way but just sweet enough.Red Moon Tea steeping...The interesting thing to note was that he left me with a timer for steeping my tea. He said to wait five minutes before you start drinking the tea. For all the teahouses I've been to, this is the first time that ever happened to me. That's pretty cool.Red Moon TeaThe strong scent of strawberries keep wafting out of my mug as I patiently wait for that five minutes to pass by. I wanted to drink it NOW. But I waited. Once time's up, I took a sip of the tea and it's worth the wait. It tastes like strawberries with a touch of a spicy, savory component since the tea menu mentioned that there's black pepper in the brew. The strawberry flavor isn't very dominant, it's more like a background flavor. It's a nice alternative compared to drinking green tea at home everyday.Back to my dessert qualms, after my waiter left me with my drinks for five minutes or so, he asked me about the brioche and I told him, \"it's good but I don't really want a brioche.\" He then said, \"Hmm...Do you like chocolate?\" I replied, \"Of course!\" What he then did was take a pair of tongs and gave me a tiny little chocolate muffin, at least what I presumed it was. He told me that it's their chocolate flourless cake. So there I have it.It's a very dainty chocolate cupcake. It's tasty on its own without frosting. It's light, enough chocolate flavor and it's slightly moist in the center. What I'm complaining about that it's so tiny. My waiter returned and he inquired me about this cake, and I told him that I liked it a lot. Since he felt bad that the sweets didn't worked out too well for me, he got me another one of those cupcakes and said, \"It's on the house.\" Now, I felt a bit guilty about him giving me dessert freebies but I ate it anyways and enjoyed it.When I asked for the check, he seriously didn't charged me for any of the food I ate or at least take a bite out of. I was flabbergasted. I paid nonetheless and gave him a generous tip just because he put up with my crap.Check at Sanctuary TLater on the week, I think it was Monday, I went all the way downtown in the Wall Street area to get myself and Kim (since her birthday's coming up soon and I'm seeing her later on the week) some beautiful, delicious chocolates from Christopher Norman.InteriorOnce I stepped into this place, I was bewildered in what the heck do I want to buy. I mean, look at the choices! The flavors! Oh, if I had a huge expense account (or a sugar daddy), I would have one of everything.Red Wine Grapes(Something) with Green Apple Caramel GanacheCappuccino Cups Espresso Topped with Grand MarnierHibiscus Rose & MangoCoconut Curry & Orange CaramelThose were just a few of the plethora of other photos that I've taken from their display case. Most of the flavor combinations sound so interesting. But I refrained from buying everything, and went for a Mango, that chocolate thingy that looks like an apple, Pear William, and the Cappuccino Cup. I bought Kim about a dozen pieces of chocolate so she could indulge herself for her birthday. Anyways, after I paid the chocolates, the guy who took my order offered me a sample of their chocolates. It's technically the imperfect chocolates that they won't sell since it's not pretty enough. I ended up taking their Champagne pyramid truffle.My Pyramid on top of my box of chocsThat chocolate pyramid was hard to put in my mouth since it's quite large and it's difficult to take bites out of since the chocolate's tempered and it'll shatter all over the table. But anyways, the Champagne flavor was quite potent, melding with the dark, bittersweet (about 70% cocoa) ganache filling. Oh, that was lovely.Then I moved on to taking individual photos of my chocolates...MangoMango innards(Something) with Green Apple Caramel GanacheCappuccino CupPear WilliamThe mango was intense. It's smells like mango (if you bring that bonbon near your nose), it's sweet but not very, and the mango filling tastes like you had mango puree and reduced it into half and incorporate it with white chocolate from the looks of it. It also tastes like they used a 60% bittersweet chocolate coating.The rest I ate at home and they're all very delicious. The things I remembered was that the Pear William tasted more like apple puree than a pear due to the filing was quite mushy like applesauce but had a very subtle hint of pear.The cappuccino cup was actually a two-piece bonbon. The saucer was pure chocolate, around 60%, and the cup itself is the truffle. Rich, chocolate-espresso flavor with a punch of citrusy Grand Marnier. I would consider that my favorite of the bunch I had.The apple shaped chocolate was cute to look at but again that apple puree didn't work for me texturally since it's like eating fine strained applesauce with tempered chocolate; it doesn't work.On Tuesday afternoon, after classes I was craving for gelato since it's so humid and cloudy that day. The only gelato place that I haven't gone to in the city so far was Ciao Bella, so I might as well try it.Ciao Bella GelatoAfter perusing the flavors they have that day, I sampled the pistachio. Strangely, it had that alcoholic off-taste that signals my brain to say, \"it ain't pistachio.\" So, I went for a small cup of hazelnut and coffee gelato.My cup of gelatoAngled shotTexture shotIt's creamy, dense, and the flavors tastes what it should be like. The hazelnut tastes like roasted hazelnuts and coffee tastes like coffee with cream. It's not the best gelato I've ever eaten (as in transcends me to gelato heaven) but it's very good.On the morning of my lunch with Ariel at Tia Pol, I haven't eaten breakfast so I went to Bryant Park to 'wichcraft for some coffee and a pastry.'wichcraftIced CappuccinoCinnamon Roll (macro shot)InnardsThe iced cappuccino was decent for something that isn't Starbucks. It's a bit too milky for my liking but at least it has that bracing bitter bite of espresso at the end.The cinnamon roll was pretty small than what I would imagine but it's a good size. The bready bun with the spicy cinnamon swirl with a touch of sweet sugar glaze, tasted quite good but it's not mind-blowing greatness that I had with Bouchon Bakery's sticky bun. Even though it's like comparing apples to oranges, it's just the idea of a sticky, bread-like pastry that I'm just trying to differentiate.Fast forwarding past my lunch at Tia Pol, I went to Big Booty Bread to try out their Cheese Rock and Guava Booty Roll that several people's been telling me about.Big Booty BreadBaked GoodsMore baked goods...Guava Booty RollInnardsThe guava booty roll was sweet, light, and somehow it tasted more like strawberry than guava. Hmm...maybe the guy who took my order got confused with their strawberry? But if it is a strawberry roll, it's pretty tasty. I just wish for more filling.Cheese RockInnardsMacro of innardsThe cheese rock is unlike any other roll I've ever tasted. It's dense and it had pockets of cheese throughout the roll. I would imagine if this was fresh out of the oven, it would be mind-boggling good. Oozy cheese with bread, how can you go wrong with that?So that's my photo-riffic post again, my lack of words are due to the fact that I'm TIRED and it's midnight as I'm writing this entry so, I need some sleep before I'll start writing about Tia Pol and other food happenings, meetings, and what have you.Addresses: Resto 111 E 29th Street New York, NY 10016Sanctuary T 337 W Broadway New York, NY 10013Christopher Norman Chocolates 60 New Street New York, NY 10004Ciao Bella Gelato 285 Mott Street New York, NY 10012-3430, USBig Booty Bread 261 W 23rd Street New York, NY 10011

Holy jeebus, I ate so much freakin' food last week just reviewing my photos on Flickr. It's scary...and it's a good thing I paced myself and this week but I'm not going to write about that yet since the week's not over. Anyways, here's a week's worth of food (again). Strap yourselves and hang on for the ride!Last Tuesday morning I went to Bis Co Latte mainly for biscotti, those wonderful twice-baked Italian cookies. I know biscotti is not an equivalent to donuts or muffins but really, I don't care. I just want to sink my teeth in some tasty, crunchy cookies dipped or served with some good cappuccino.Bis Co LatteEven though the storefront looks like any other bakery I've ever encountered, I wasn't expecting bright blocks colors of orange and green greeting me once I stepped in. Looks energetic and bright...it's different.InteriorOnce I approached the counter where there are tons of baked goods and an entire wall full of various biscotti flavors, I was floored. I have absolutely no idea what biscotti flavors I want. At least the girl who worked behind the counter told me that right behind where I stood were samples I can try so I can decide...and it's not a few sprinklings of flavors, it's more like a dozen to try!Their baked goodsJars of biscottiBiscotti samplesOMG...more samplesI think I tried about half a dozen or so flavors and I ended up choosing two that I tried, the Chocolate Gianduja, Kahlua Chocolate Espresso Bean, and something that I would never ever would've thought of as a biscotti flavor: Savory Red Wine, Pepper and Olive Oil. I also had iced cappuccino to go along with these cookies since it's summer-like that week.Iced CappuccinoPlate of biscottiThe cappuccino was quasi-decent. I'm not expecting it to be on par with Joe's or Ninth Street but this was too milky for me. It's like drinking weak espresso flavored milk. The biscotti fared a lot better. The savory one was actually quite good. It reminded me of a food I ate before but I can't put a finger on it. But it tasted rich, slightly peppery but not spicy, and it's a bit crisp. Actually, all the biscotti were crisp but some where a tad softer than others, depending on the type of flavor. My favorite would be the Kahlua espresso bean since it has potent espresso flavor and it's really crisp and crunchy.I forgot to mention, they also have gelato. Since I'm always up for gelato (unless I'm sick, of course), I tried a few of their limited flavors before I bought a small cup. Their pistachio tasted weird. It's like they added too much almond extract or something alcoholic that it tasted really artificial. I tried their Cappuccino Crunch since she said it's pretty tasty, which I agree on the most part. The fig is basically a vanilla base mixed with chunks of dried fig, which didn't rock my world. So, what I ended up going for is a cup of cappuccino crunch and the bacio, since it seemed like a safe flavor.Gelatos and sorbetsMy cup of gelatoThe bacio wasn't so bad. It's basically chocolate and mixed with hazelnut and possibly chunks of Ferro Rocher? Something about the bits of chocolatey hazelnuts that tasted like it. I just wish that the gelato was creamier and more flavor.On Wednesday, I finally went to Burger Joint in Le Parker Meridien Hotel. Everyone tells me that their burger is totally awesome yet somehow I keep forgetting to go there last semester, despite the fact I always pass by the hotel every morning and late afternoon to go to and from school.Entrance to the Burger JointTheir HoursSince it was 12:30 in the afternoon, this place is packed to the gills. About seventy percent of the diners there are local office workers and the other thirty would be tourists. I had to stand in line to order and hoping that there will be a table or a seat available for me to sit down and eat. Just to kill some time, I just took a few photos of the place.People...Too many of them...How to order your burgerThe kitchenDump your junk pleaseAfter I ordered and paid my hamburger with the works, rare, I spotted a table and put all my crap school books, on it just to mark my territory. You have no idea how much of a commodity it is to get a table here. Even though it looks pretty packed from my earlier photos, once I sat down it's a TON of people since more began to walk through the doorway. It almost reminds me of a line of Shake Shack proportions, but not as bad.The crowd eating and chatting near meMy burgerInnardsThe burger was juicy, it's waay more flavorful than what I had in Burger Heaven from the mayonnaise, ketchup, and mustard, and it's cooked to a rare-medium rare. They need to do something about that bun though. It's not toasted or anything that would lend a contrasting texture to all the softness of the meat and the slight crispness of the lettuce, pickles, red onions, and tomato but at least it absorbed the meat juices nicely. This is the second best burger I've had so far. Shake Shack still rules in my book.On Thursday morning, I left home without any coffee. And you should know by now that if I don't have coffee, I will not be a functioning, happy camper. Since I wanted to change my typical stop at Joe's or Ninth Street, I remember reading about La Colombe Torrefaction in TriBeca and I schelped my way down there.La ColombeFront interiorBack interiorIt was about 8 AM when I arrived there, hence it looked empty in the back area. I ended up ordering a cup of cappuccino (I don't like lattes that much, in case you haven't noticed) and an interesting pastry that's flecked with pistachios. I found out it's a pistachio apricot croissant from Petrossian.My cappuccinoDetail shotApricot Pistachio CroissantThe croissant was really good. It had an über thin, shattering layer with buttery yet crisp strata of dough and marzipan, stuffed with chunks of apricot. Surprisingly, it's not cloyingly sweet. Mmmm...I wouldn't mind having this pastry every morning, but I'm cutting my life span in half at that rate.Croissant in halfInnardsLater on after my classes were over, I wanted fried chicken. Definitely not KFC or any major franchise. Where I ended up was at Bonbon Chicken at TriBeca. Yeah, I somehow felt like going really downtown. Probably just because I don't go there that often and need to explore there.Bonbon ChickenMenu boardsI ended up having a small order of spicy chicken strips with a bun. Rice was the other option but I don't want rice since I eat it at home. I was told to wait for 15 minutes but I ended up waiting for 20 just because they haven't prepare it yet and wings were the sole parts that was readily available.My bag o' foodStrips of chickenBunAs you can see from the above photos, it's not too bad for something that costs about $7. The chicken strips were really spicy after eating one since the heat builds up slowly and progressively that the back of my throat felt like it's on fire and my eyes start to tear up. It's a good, temporary type of pain. The bun was soft, sweet, and slightly denser than the average bun. It tastes good but I wish it was a tad bigger so that it could help diminish the fire in my throat besides the water that I have with me.But since my throat was still burning a bit, I want need ice cream. Since I don't want to go to my usual destinations (e.g. Otto, Sundaes & Cones, etc.), I thought of trying Ronnybrook Milk Bar's ice cream in Chelsea Market.Ronnybrook Milk BarPartial view of interiorCookies!After thinking about it for a while, I ended up settling for a small cup of Ginger Crème Brûlée Ice Cream. It seems more interesting than the other flavors they were offering and they only allow one flavor for a small.Cup of Ginger Crème Brûlée Ice CreamTexture shotSpooned...The ice cream was not as creamy as I would like it but it has good vanilla flavor with a subtle hints and texture of candied ginger. The photo you see above is when I happen to scoop a HUGE chunk of candied ginger. It's decent for what it is but I still prefer gelato.That's it for last week. I know the majority of this post is packed with a TON of photos instead of me being so loquacious. I'm sorry. It's just the fact that I'm backed up with classwork, writing mini food editorials at Yumondo (which my time is about to end with them very soon), and study for LSATs that's approaching in less than two weeks. Yikes! So, if the next post will be similar to this, please bear with me as my brain is about to self-destruct.Addresses: Bis Co Latte 667 10th Avenue New York, NY 10036Burger Joint in Le Meridien Parker Hotel 118 W 57th Street New York, NY 10019La Colome Torrefaction 319 Church Street New York, NY 10013Bonbon Chicken 98 Chambers Street New York, NY 10007Ronnybrook Milk Bar 75 9th Avennue New York, NY 10011

Eating Lunch Like Royalty at Jean Georges

***CONTENT
When I ate this particular lunch at Jean Georges on Tuesday, I realized my blog's birthday is a year and two days old (if you include the time when I was at Blogger and I moved to my current address here)...it's just beginning to crawl to its infant stage and hopefully progresses to grow to a slightly normal child. I said \"slightly normal\" because it's a food obsessed child. Well, I guess it's my unintentional splurge birthday present to my blog. Even though, I'm actually the one who is physically eating the food. But still \"Happy Birthday!\" to my blog. You're officially a year old. And thank you readers for actually make this blog worthwhile to write about besides my insane love for food.Anyways, back to Jean Georges. I basically made reservations at Jean Georges in the formal dining room, since I went to the casual section, Nougatine, about four years ago with another friend of mine, Seungmi. This time I invited Ariel. He's more my dining companion for the splurge places these days.Jean GeorgesI arrived earlier than the expected reservation and the hostess walked me to my table, passing the bar/Nougatine dining area to the minimalist, hotel-style room, where everything is done in beige and white, and each table has either a leather banquette or a leather chair. The odd thing I found out was that the table I'm seated is basically a rectangular table where diners sit side-by-side, instead of sitting across from one another. Eventually when Ariel had arrived, I realized that most of our conversations were basically talking out to the void (since we look straightforward unless we turn our head or glance at each other sideways) even though we know we're speaking to one another. But it's a small flaw we've dealt with.Interior of the Formal Dining RoomSince I was waiting for Ariel for a good amount of time since I was early for the reservation by 10 minutes and he's late by 5 minutes, the waiter let me peruse through the lunch and dessert menus instead of me staring at the diners or the abyss to occupy my time.Lunch MenuDessert MenuAfter reading these menus for 3 minutes, I've already made up my mind about what I want to order. It's just Ariel that worries me, which I'll explain a bit later.Eventually, they served me bread (a choice of French roll, wheat or sourdough) and butter.Butta...My French RollTheir tiny salt bowl; close upWhile I was helping myself to my roll, the good thing about the butter, besides being a bit fussy serving it, the butter was actually room temperature soft! For once, I'm not served with a frozen, unspreadable puck of churned cream! Too bad the roll was unremarkable though...Ariel finally graced his presence and the waiter set him up with the lunch menu and bread. After perusing and contemplating the menu for five minutes or so, he eventually ordered the watermelon gazpacho and the foie gras brulée (which is basically two appetizers), while I have the sea urchin and sweetbreads. Yes, I love my animal innards and the innards of prickly marine animals.A good thing to note was that the waiter was attentive enough to ask both of us, \"Do we had any food allergies that the kitchen should be aware of?\" We both replied no. I think it's the first time from the myriad of times that I've ever eaten out that anyone asked me that question.After we ordered, we chat about his visit to Chicago over the weekend and noshed a bit on the bread and butter, which he slathered on thick and heavy on sprinkling the salt on top too. Eventually, our amuse bouche had arrived.Amuse BoucheThe first thing we've tried (we had our own though but tried in unison) was the Mission fig and house-made mozzarella; that was pretty damn good. The slightly chewy, creamy, mild cheese worked well with the soft, sweet, ripened fig, highlighted with tiny zips of lemon zest.Mission fig with house made mozzarellaThe corn puff, which is basically a fried fritter with corn salt and arugula purée. Once I cut the puff in half, wisp of steam emanating out of it. The light, crisp exterior with the chewy, airy innards, speckled with sweet corn kernels. It was wonderful, especially that corn salt made all the flavors spoke in volumes on my palate.Corn puffCorn puff innardsAnd last but not least, the shot glass of cucumber soup and yuzu foam. This was making my tongue experiencing euphoria. The refreshing cucumber meets the bright, citrusy, yuzu and the airiness of the foam...oh my goodness. It's like a non-alcoholic version of apéritif.That is a shot that I don't mind taking everyday. Or just give me a meal of those three amuse bouches (in bigger portions obviously) and I'll be happy. Ariel proposed the same as well.Our first course had arrived, the waiter arrived and explained each of our dishes (which he does at every course). Ariel's Heirloom Watermelon Gazpacho, Cucumber, Tomato, Basil soup was presented in a deep bowl filled with chopped vegetation (i.e. tomatoes, herbs, etc.) then the waiter poured the gazpacho into his bowl. It's kind of cool that they present you the bowl and pour the contents into the vessel. At least you have a vague sense of what's in the soup besides the gazpacho. Since I didn't taste it, he told me that it tasted like the normal gazpacho but he likes the Modern Bar Room's interpretation that he had back in Restaurant Week more than this one.My Santa Barbara Sea Urchin, Black Bread, Jalapeño, Yuzu was basically finger food, and it was suggested by the waiter to eat with my fingers. The mild, creamy, slightly sweet, sea urchin with the toasted black bread worked so well by contrasting textures (it also helps with that smear of butter under the urchin). The jalapeño pepper and yuzu brought interesting flavors to the party, the spice that kicked in the back of my throat with the citrusy tartness that plays along the sea urchin's delicate flavor.Santa Barbara Sea Urchin, Black Bread, Jalapeño, YuzuMacro viewFor our second course, Ariel's foie gras brulée was not what I've pictured it in my mind when I read it. It's actually a piece of brioche topped with a round of foie gras, drizzled with 20 year aged balsamic vinegar. When Ariel let me try a piece, it's not what I've expected. It's creamy, rich, fatty, and everything that is a characteristic of foie gras but the broiche was soft, that it didn't really give a contrasting texture but the balsamic vinegar did gave it some acidic sweetness to contrast slightly the fattiness of the foie. It's good but I'm not entirely enamored with it.Foie Gras Brulé, Slowly Roasted Strawberries, Aged BalsamicMy Crispy Sweetbreads, Fragrant Pickled Peach, Wild Arugula, and Pink Peppercorn (instead of being roasted as indicated on the menu) was very, very good. I know some of you are turned off with the idea that eating a thymus gland is disgusting but trust me, if you eat one that is prepared well, you will never be disgusted by it. The crisp coating meets the meaty sweetbreads made me swoon. Even when Ariel tried it, he's flabbergasted by the thought that sweetbreads can taste so good. The peaches and arugula gave it extra peppery flavor and the peaches gave it an offset of tart-sweetness to the entire dish. I love it.Zoomed out view...Close upInnards of sweetbreadsSince I believe that a meal almost always end with dessert, and we did. I ordered the Strawberry, while Ariel had the Mixed Berry. The names reflect the theme of that particular dessert.My desserts worships the strawberry. The buttery, dense, orange brioche, filled with almond cream, layered with almond flakes, and topped with sweet roasted strawberries; all sitting on top of strawberry gel. This was gooood.Then my little bowl of strawberry ice cream with lavender fruit leather was dainty but sublime together. The ice cream is pure strawberry and super creamy, while the fruit leather is more like a crisp, floral tuile that goes well together.StrawberryStrawberry Ice CreamAriel's Mixed Berry desserts seem to do well since I haven't tried any of his. He certainly loved the Raspberry Rose Water Soup, Champagne Sorbet since the Champagne flavor was potent according to him. The tart seemed to be fine when I just look at his reaction to it. I guess they should just make a drink from that first part of that dessert and he'll be a really happy camper.Mixed BerriesShot glass of Raspberry Rose Water Soup, Champagne SorbetAfter we're done with our desserts and requested the check, they roll out the cart, carrying a large jar of house-made marshmallows for our petit fours, which also include a tray of house-made chocolate, and mini macarons.He's about to cut the marshmallows...Snipping...Plate of marshmallows (macro view)Mini macaronsTray of ChocolatesThe trioAs you might see from the photos, the macarons are tiny. I mean microscopically tiny that it loses the texture and integrity of what a French macaron should be. (Technically, they're about half an inch in diameter). Anyways, the three flavors of macarons are vanilla, coffee, and poppy seed. Flavor-wise they are spot on: the vanilla is vanilla-y, the coffee has a slight, bracing bitterness, and the poppy seed basically tastes like the vanilla but it has a slight nutty flavor. Texturally, it's a major disappointment; it's just dry with a touch of moisture from the creamy filling that sandwiches the itty-bitty cookies.I just never seen anyone cut marshmallows before me like that. I would just take that marshmallow rope and nosh away if I had that but obviously since it is Jean Georges, it's all about class and presentation. The marshmallows were good. The three flavors were strawberry, vanilla, and mint. The strawberry didn't really taste like it had enough strawberry. The vanilla was a bit bland even though there are flecks of vanilla bean sprinkled throughout that cube, but the mint has the most potent flavor of the three. I honestly care less about them if I knew.The chocolates were very good. I would almost equate them to Kee's or La Maison du Chocolat since the flavors are so vibrant and fresh. The only problem is that I don't remember what were the flavors. Pooh. At least I enjoyed them.Well, that's the end of the meal. I have never encountered such theatrics of sorts from a restaurant before but I thoroughly enjoyed that experience, despite the fact it made my wallet a bit lighter.Address: Jean Georges 1 Central Park W New York, NY 10023

I've never heard of a higher-end restaurant serving marshmallows until I read the menu of this one restaurant in Chicago that has s'mores for a dessert. Interesting idea.The cucumber soup and the yuzu foam sounds really interesting. Was the soup savory?

Marge: that is my party of 3 sitting there!  This is eye popping to see my image in someone else's photo on the Internet!.How did your party start after us and finish before us?  We had 2 courses each plus dessert and the usual treats afterwards that you mentioned.  Your party was gone before we had dessert.We enjoyed our lunch as well.  I had the Ribbon Tuna and the Corn Ravioli, others in my party had the Garlic Soup with the Frog Legs. Foie Gras, and some kind of salad that I can't remember.I have had all the above in various visits except for the salad. All outstanding.How was your service?  Ours was off. (For JG standards anyway.)  I find dinner to be a perfect experience, but the lunch hour service needs some improvement.The new dining room is a nice improvement.  What a difference with the sheer curtains instead of those blinds they  used to have. And that hidous checkered board carpet is gone :)Maybe we shall \"see\" each other again in our photos!

Srin: Oh, thanks! :) At least you're putting imaginary pounds on, not the real stuff I like am.Chubby Panda: I LOVE their uni toast! And it's a total splurge lunch and worth every penny.Stephanie: Um...do you mean Tina (me) instead of Marge (a commenter and visitor of this site)?Anyways, my party finished before you because of time restrictions. Ariel, my accompanying diner that day, had to go back to work and I have to go back to class. Hence, we rushed the waiters to move a bit faster and we ate a bit quickly as well.In terms of service, I find it a bit off. Even though it's been ages since I last visited JG besides this post, they did ignore us a bit while we finished our dishes/meal a good ten minutes or so. It's understood that they don't want to rush a diner, but since it's the afternoon and we have our own careers/lives, we don't have that leisure of time. I guess dinner would be more appropriate or accommodating since everyone's generally not in a hurry to be somewhere.Maybe we shall see or meet someday...that's if we recognize each other in some way.

As you can tell these past recent weeks, I'm writing pretty much an average about a post a week. It's going to be like this for a while just because I'm snowballed with school and I'm dreading the LSATs! Good lord help me on the latter. I'm scared the wits out of me for this one test for the sake of law school. Anyways, I'm writing the aforementioned on the title but skipping out on Jean Georges just because that restaurant deserves its own post. Even though you see or seen the photos on my Flickr gallery.On Saturday, I felt brunch-y and motivated to brave the mythical lines that one would face at Prune.Hostess checking out the line...People...Once I got in the place is pretty much packed. Tables were close together, just barely letting a person fit in between each table. Lively chatter from the diners surrounding me. This place is charming. It has this old French country feel with worn walls, antique mirrors, and the open French doors of sorts where I was sitting. It's unlike any other restaurant I've ever been in, in a good way.The BarInteriorLooking toward the backThe interior shots you see above are partial views since I'm siting all the way up in the front, looking past everyone's shoulders. And they happen to be taller than me, which isn't too hard since I'm petite anyways. Besides the atmosphere of this place, I'm here for the FOOD. But before we get to that, I ordered their \"Prune juice.\" It's basically a wonderful blend of Meyer lemon, orange, lime and ruby grapefruit juices. A good balance of sweet and tart.Now, here's their brunch specials menu.What really appealed to me was the most decadent, artery-clogging plate of them all: the Monte Cristo. Why? Here's a few photos to show you what I mean...Monte CristoClose upCheesy...If the photos haven't given you a hint, the Monte Cristo is basically a savory-sweet, deep fried, stuffed (with meats) French toast. What they did is basically build a triple decker sandwich of ham, turkey and swiss cheese; dip it in a custard-style batter, and deep fry it. Oh yeah...if that doesn't say HEART ATTACK, I don't think anything else will. It also accompanied with an egg over-easy and red currant jelly.The egg and it's gushy...Surprisingly, it sounds a lot heavier than it tastes. I don't feel like a total slob after eating that since I felt just satiated. I asked for the check, and the cute thing to note is that they give a Scottie dog shaped licorice along the check. I paid and took the subway uptown to get to class. Yes, I have a Saturday class just because I don't want to take a night class and commute the way home late every weeknight.My checkPrune after I leftSince it's considered the first day of the weekend class, my professor was kind enough to dismiss the class early just because it's the Labor Day Weekend and she admits she wants to get out too. Somehow, I was hungry after classes were over and headed down to Shake Shack.I normally would assume that 2:45 PM would be considered as off-hours but I was wrong. I was sent all the way back to the end of the line that reaches near the US Open booths in Madison Square Park.The line in front of me...I'm really behindI'm guessing since it is the Labor Day weekend, Manhattanites and tourists alike took advantage of the good, warm, albeit humid weather for some delicious burgers.Shack-cerise!They had those signs up for entertainment, me thinks? It's strewn along the path where everyone's waiting and reading. It's basic yoga stretching and balancing poses. Anyways, I ended up waiting about 45 minutes to order my Double Stack. Yes, for all that waiting I just want the Double Stack. No fries. No shake. No custard. I know some of you are shaking your heads at me in disgrace thinking that I was insane to both stand in line for that long and wasted that much time for one burger. But it's not just any burger. It's the burger of my dreams...InnardsI wholly admit that the innards shot is a bit gruesome but it's better than the few I've taken and deleted. Anyways, I'm in love with this burger. A fried puck of cheese sandwiched between two portobello mushrooms, another layer of American cheese, and their delicious Shack burger, all fit into this lovely, slightly fluffy bun. *sighs* I think I died happily in gustatory heaven. But my senses crashed down to Earth as my gut felt like a brick, which is typical whenever I eat here. I walked a few miles in the city and then ran on the treadmill when I got back home. That's my usual remedy.Over the weekend, my mother was craving for homemade noodles. I just know how to make pasta, not noodles, if you're technical about the exact definition of both. Nevertheless, she wanted me to make a batch for her.I made pasta!What she ended up pairing the pasta was braised pigs' feet with onions. OMG. This is comfort food to me. The chewy, eggy strands of pasta mixed with savory, sweet (from the onions), melt-in-my-mouth silkiness from the collagen, pork meat, and pork fat. Yums.My bowl of comfort...On Tuesday morning I randomly walked into Chelsea Market. Just because I was thinking of having some carby goodness from Amy's Bread but I got distracted since just next door or next stand practically, I saw a coffee bar. That coffee/espresso bar was Ninth Street Espresso.Ninth Street EspressoAs usual, I ordered their cappuccino. Since their espresso is pretty damn good compared to most places I've tried in the city. It's robust, lovely crema, and it's very smooth.CappuccinoDetail shot of cappuccinoThen after my lunch at Jean Georges with Ariel (which I'll be posting within a day or so), I went all the way downtown to Battery Park to try Picnick's dessert.PicnickMenuYou might be wondering why the heck would I go all the way down there in the first place. To tell you the truth, I'm just curious about the dessert portion since it's one of Will Goldfarb's (the dessert chef of the recently closed Room 4 Dessert, which I missed out on) projects, and it's environmentally friendly which intrigues me even further about this establishment. It sounds a lot like 'wichcraft but I want to know if there's any difference between the two.Since it is almost 4 PM, all of their sandwiches were sold out except for the vegetarian option (as they've told me, but I didn't care for a sandwich at the moment). All I ended up having was their pistachio panna cotta and their Seasonal Soda of the day.Panna CottaMy sodaThe strange fact when I asked for a straw, the guy who worked there said, \"Sorry. We are not allowed to give out straws.\" He's assuming that the park conservancy didn't want people to litter the place with straws. Weird. But the interesting thing was their spoon is biocompostable. I'm taking it that it's biodegradable. Um...to show you what I mean.Usually, I'm not a soda drinker. But what I remember reading somewhere is that they make their own soda without those corn or fructose syrups that you usually find in the canned stuff. But I forgot to ask was the flavor. What I end up tasting was Meyer lemon and a subtle hint of orange. It's more of a dry soda than sweet, and it tastes good. I need that refreshing, carbonated feel since I'm dying in this summer-like heat in NYC. Even though it's September, summer's hanging around for a bit.The panna cotta...what can I say about this dessert? It looks pretty, doesn't have that hideous, neon shade of green, and it has those small, ripe strawberries but does it taste good. I'm going to find out.Panna cotta from other side of the labelSpoon of panna cottaThe panna cotta was creamy, not tough and gelatinous. It's just sweet enough and the pistachio flavor was wonderful, it's not artificial or alcoholic tasting, and the ripe, super sweet strawberries. Mmmm...I like this a lot. Admittedly a lot more than what I tasted from Eleven Madison Park when I ate there during Restaurant Week.The good thing about being in Battery Park is the view of the water. I just sat at the table near Picnick, slowly eating my pistachio panna cotta, and sipping my soda, lounging for the next hour soaking in the views. That's a good afternoon.The viewAddresses: Prune 54 E 1st Street New York, NY 10003Shake Shack Madison Ave & E 23rd St New York, NY 10010Ninth Street Espresso 75 9th Avenue New York, NY 10011Picnick State St & Battery Pl New York, NY 10004, US (Note that it's in Battery Park just east of Castle Clinton)

How I aced the LSAT (albeit 18 years ago):  I bought the book on it that Barrons put out and did the proctice tests with a stopwatch.  Bingo.  Good luck!

Saturday was kind of unusual for me. It's rainy yet warm, I feel so stinkin' tired because I want to finish up my papers...and I passed by an anti-war protest in Union Square as I walked around the Greenmarket (or Farmers' Market, as most New Yorkers call it). I know the latter didn't make sense, but it follows the \"unusual\" part on a tangent...Rain, rain, go away...ProtestersSince I don't want to eat out in the rain from picking up a few pastries in the Market, I seek shelter and submerge myself into a cup of tea and some pastries. Remembering from reading on Chowhound that Amai is open recently, I walked over there and check the place out.Amai's Open!Counter/Tea SectionShelf of goodsEntering this casual, exposed brick tea house, it feels welcoming and laid back. There's a tall shelf of teas, cookies, and brownies on one side of the wall, on the other side is a refrigerated beverage case what is taking most of the narrow space is the pastry, tea, and coffee counters where it takes center stage.I perused the selections of cookies and pastries, and as usual, I'm indecisive in what to get. I actually met Kelli of Lovescool and asked her what would she recommend in trying. I was hungry and I'm up for anything really. She ended up recommending me a bunch of things like their Green Tea Red Bean Muffin, a couple of their tea cookies, especially the White Tea Strawberry cookie, and the Roasted Sweet Potato Puff Pastry.After thinking about it for a few moments, I ended up with the Green Tea Red Bean Muffin, the Chocolate, Coconut, Fig cookie, and their Sweet Potato Puff Pastry; all served along with a pot of Bamboo Mountain tea.My lunch...or is it early afternoon tea?Plate of Chocolate, Coconut Fig Cookie and Green Tea Red Bean MuffinI tried the cookie first since I can't pass up something that looks like a truffle and it's actually a cookie. I was thinking, you get the best of both worlds! Anyways, after taking a bite of this cookie this is like a barely baked chocolate truffle. It has a very thin crust on the outside and the innards are filled with chunks of dried figs and large flakes of toasted coconut. It's very sweet due to the fig and very nutty from the coconut. Tasty but pretty damn sweet. I needed a couple of sips of tea to dilute the sugar.It's bitten...After getting that sweet start, I went on with the Green Tea Red Bean Muffin. For some reason, I have high expectations with this muffin. I can't explain why, but I wanted to be swooned by it. Also, I strangely thought there would be red bean paste smothered somewhere in that muffin. I know this is not an Asian bakery but my mind was drifting somewhere with this muffin since I read the sign that says \"red bean\" and usually my mind translates that to red bean paste. Weird. I probably should have went to bed earlier...Enough of my weird food ramblings and getting to the actual muffin, I thought the muffin was generally good. It's not greasy, it has a fine, tender yet structured texture, and just sweet enough that it doesn't feel like I'm eating a cupcake. My small qualms with this muffin is that it doesn't taste like there's enough green tea flavor and the actual red beans (adzuki, technically) didn't really contribute much either, except that occasional bites of smoothness, not flavor. I like it. I wanted to love it. But alas, I'm not completely taken by the muffin. It has potential but it needs some tinkering, in my opinion.Muffin split into two...For the final pastry, I tried, the Roasted Sweet Potato with Puff Pastry. First of all it looks pretty and slightly rustic with the dried \"gushing\" of the sweet potato coming out of the crack of the puff pastry. The puff pastry itself is very delicate, buttery, and light, sweetened with the sweet, spice sugar glaze that topped it off. The innards are filled with subtly sweetened mashed roasted sweet potatoes, echoing the spices that was in that sugar glaze. Very delicious.Roasted Sweet Potato with Puff PastryAfter finishing my meal of sorts, I took a lot of photos of their pastry display cases. Here's a few of them...Eggplant Quiche and Roasted Sweet Potato Puff PastryBread Puddings!Chocolate Croissant and Vanilla Bean SconesGreen Tea Scones and Earl Grey and Currant SconesThere's plenty more photos of their sweets, if you want to see more, click here. I'm not going to kill you all with a ton of photos.Then after classes, I was craving for a cup of hot chocolate, even though it's nearly 70 degrees Fahrenheit... I walked over to Rockefeller Center to La Maison du Chocolat.My original intention was to have their cup of hot chocolate and maybe a macaron or two, but after walking from my campus to LMDC, I felt hungry and went a little crazy with ordering more than enough sugar to make a little five year-old jump off the walls. Just take a look below...My spread of sweetsYep, I lost it a bit. I ended up getting a cup of Guayquil hot chocolate, a chesnut mousse chocolate tart, and three small macarons.Melting blob of whipped creamIt's been years since I've drank La Maison's hot chocolate. I think the last time I ever had their hot chocolate was at their chocolate tasting classes about two years ago. Anyways, it's still awesome albeit a pricey cup for $8. This cup of hot chocolate is like drinking a diluted form of 62% ganache. It's smooth, silky, a bit thick, and oh-so chocolatey. The plop of whipped cream made it extra special.Chestnut Mousse Chocolate TartThe chestnut mousse chocolate tart is one sophisticated dessert. It's not at all sweet. Just mere hints of sweetness from the mousse and the chocolate ganache that fills this tart. The pâte sucrée crust that lines this tart is buttery, crisp, and barely sweet. This rendition of the basic chocolate tart is trying to tie in with the fall season, very a exquisite one at that.InnardsThen I finished off the entire dessert flight with the macarons: coffee, caramel, and chocolate. All were very good and delicious but I still crave for Pierre Herme's magnificent macarons. Oh how my soul would weep for joy if I had one again...I need to get my butt to Paris soon! LMDC's macarons are the best in NYC after that extensive search I went with Robyn earlier this year.The cookie has a nice, thin, smooth crust with a soft, moist crumb. A good ratio of ganache or filing to cookie, and the filling is not cloyingly sweet. All three had the aforementioned and their fillings were intensely flavored but I want the unique flavor combinations that PH has.Trio of macarons and its innardsThat's my sugar-filled Saturday. I really need to go my gym and burn the extra sugar and fat ingested...Addresses: Amai Tea & Bake House 171 3rd Avenue New York, NY 10003Maison du Chocolat 30 Rockefeller Plz New York, NY 10112

next time i'm in nyc, i'll have to go to lmdc! I'm so pissed at myself because all the bezillion of times I been to the rockefeller center last couple of times i was in manhatten, i had no idea such a gem was right there. This is the *same* rockefeller center as the one with the skating rink right? Midtown gets me disoriented like a retarded rat in a super hard maze.And between you and TGWAE, I just feel like I won't be able to live with myself unless I get my paws on some macarons SOON.

AHH JEBUS, I want to go to Amai and LMDC!  I want to feast on scones and muffins and whatever.Sometime.  I suppose.That's some impressive fooding you did there.  :)  I've never tried a tart from LMDC!  Ahh!  And I've only had the hot chocolate once AGES ago.  I still remember it...cos it was awesome...

Roze: I liked their pastries. Just some more than others.Dana: Yes, it's the Rockefeller Center where the skating rink, Christmas tree, etc. are (or will be for the latter). Basically it's on the same street where Dean & Deluca is but going toward 6th Ave.You MUST try their macarons!Sara: Yay! You've broken the ice! It's finally nice to hear from someone new. :)
Thanks!dbdtron: Yeah, it's was a pretty damn tasty puff pastry... I need to try their cookies.Robyn: I want to try Amai's scones...so tempting and different! I'm going back there eventually.Somehow, I felt hungry that day. Probably because of my lack of sleep? PMS? ...I dunno. Something's up with my metabolism.

How Sweet It Is...to Love Their Pastries!

As I've mentioned in my previous post, this is going to be about the Lower East Side bakery, How Sweet It Is.I've read about this tiny, charming place from the NY Times' Dining section from Wednesday's paper. Since I love bakeries, I might as well check the place out on Thursday when my class schedule is more flexible.Pretty carvings on the ceiling and wallCozy seatingI first arrived there about 9:15 AM, when the day was dreary, cold, and wet. As I entered the door to this warm, adorable, inviting bakery, I was welcomed by three women: two of them were the co-owners, Ellen and Beth, who were setting up their display case preparing for the morning rush.What Beth told me, they are technically in \"soft opening mode\" since they just had their Friends & Family event last night and after the press they have received from the aforementioned Times article, they decided to open up the shop earlier.After standing in front of the counter for five minutes, I was perplexed in what the heck to eat for breakfast. Beth probably read my mind, she chimed in and guided me what's available for the morning, which consisted of four different muffins (lemon blueberry, blueberry, cranberry, and another flavor that is blanking at the moment, sorry), the Lemony Cheesepuffs, four kinds of danishes, chocolate chip coffeecakes, sticky buns, rugelach, scones, and a whole plethora of other goodies that would boggle your mind! ...Or at least mine.After digesting what was said, recommended, and seen, I ended up getting myself a sticky bun and a Lemony Cheesepuff accompanied with a small cup of their Counter Culture coffee.Sticky bun...ChompedThe sticky bun was tasty. It's like biting off a buttery, tender, sugar glazed cloud that's densely swirled with currants, pecans, and chopped walnuts, that every bite a currant or nut rains. It's sweet (but not terribly) and quite sticky. It's very different from Balthazar and Bouchon's sticky buns, which I find very dense compared to this. The size is just right for breakfast where you don't feel like you're eating a really indulgent pastry for the morning.Lemony CheesepuffInnardsBut since me, being me, I went an extra mile of decadence and eaten the dainty lemony cheesepuff. Despite of it's petite size, it packs a wallop in terms of flavors and textures. It is light since it is a puff, and it each little crevices are filled with creamy, light, and lemony cream cheese. Wow. I would have gotten a couple of more of these but since my conscience is kicking in preventing me to do so, since I have already damaged my entire day's diet and have to work out an extra hour to two to compensate what I've eaten.I almost forgotten to mention their coffee. It's lighter than what I normally would love to drink. But it is nicely balanced and has a slightly acidic tone at the end. It's a good accompaniment to their pastries, rather than dominating it.After eating my breakfast, I've asked the ladies if I could take a couple of photos of this place. They don't mind but they wanted me to wait a while since they're putting up the last pastries for the morning. So, here's a couple of photos of what I've taken during the morning.Lemony CheesepuffsItalian trio cakes and Opera cakesSheep's Milk Honey Caramel Panna Cotta, Banana Fosters Cake, and Key Lime BarsAfter taken the photos (a lot more than displayed), I said goodbye to them with lingering thoughts of coming back later in the afternoon right after my government midterm. Oh yes, tests induces me to eat a ton o' sugar! It's weird but that's what happens every time.Right after my lunch at Prem-On Thai, I walked over to this bakery. Beth and another employee welcomed me back, and I explained my repeated visit to Beth that I wanted their Devil's Food and Chocolate Mousse cupcake. I'm a sucker for tiny cakes or tiny anything that is edible and pretty. After ordering the cupcake and perusing their refrigerated case, I noticed that they have rotated a few things out and noticed an intriguing looking dessert that looks like a cheesecake topped with kumquats and it's sitting on top of a nest. I asked, \"What is it?\" Beth explained that it's a goat cheesecake with candied kumquats with a kataifi nest. It sounded so good and different that I told them, \"I'll have that, too.\"Cupcake!InnardsI've had one too many cupcakes in my life where cupcakes were bone-dry, tasteless, and terribly sweet that my teeth aches in pain from the frosting. But this doesn't have any of those aforementioned characteristics. The Devil' Food cupcake is very light, ridiculously moist (in a good way), chocolatey, and filled with the creamiest chocolate mousse I've ever tasted in a cupcake; all topped with light, airy, vanilla buttercream. The most surprising thing to me is that the entire cupcake wasn't cloyingly sweet (especially the frosting), and the cake is very tender and light. This is the closest to the best cupcake I've eaten so far.Goat CheesecakeThen I moved to my last sweet of the day, the goat cheesecake. First of all, I felt kind of bad eating this aesthetically attractive dessert. I haven't seen any bakery decorate cheesecakes like this nor put kumquats in anything, unless I'm eating in a restaurant.Once I took a bite of this cake, this was heaven. The goat cheesecake was very smooth and creamy. The goat cheese was very mild that the candied kumquat just took over and imparted its sweet, tart, citrusy tones emanating on my palate. The kataifi (which is shredded phyllo dough) nest was an interesting take on the typical graham cracker cookie crust. It's very delicate and gave the cheesecake an ethereal brittleness, if you will, to the cake. If anything and everything I've tried from this bakery, this is my favorite by far.Here's more dessert photos that is different from the morning's...Brownies!Devil's Food & Chocolate Mousse CupcakesPlate o' Cupcakes!Pecan Diamonds and CookiesPiesBaklava PursesI'm in love with this bakery: the wonderful, friendly people who work here, the unique pastries and desserts, and the shop itself is so cute and welcoming! This is a great bakery and it's a welcome addition to the neighborhood. It's truly a gem. I just wish I lived closer...well, maybe not, before exercising is an afterthought.Address: How Sweet It Is 157 Allen Street New York, NY 10002

thanks for all the great pics and descriptions...but I think it is reallllllly evident you whipped this post out too soon after your midterms.  There were so many typos and grammatical problems that it was difficult to read.  Very unusual for your great blog!  Give yourself a day to rest your brain next time ;)

Caitlin: Oh jeez, I'm sorry for the grammatical problems and typographical errors that you've encountered! :(I would let my brain unwind but it's not going to happen for a while since deadlines and tests are arriving in a few days, so I can't really hold it off unless everyone's willing to wait another two weeks where my tests and papers are done.

Thanks for this post!!! :) I finally went there last night after dinner at Tien Garden across the street...didn't buy anything though, was waiting to see which items you liked best! However I thought the pastries were pretty pricey given the size...perhaps better for our bellies though, ehehehe, they're all soo precious looking - it's like a jewelry store in there! :)
thewanderingeater
2007-10-27 18:21:00
Kathy: You're welcome!
They are pricey, just like Bouchon but the atmosphere is so much more inviting and their pastries are like gems! And it's quite inventive (as in flavors) as well.

I had my browser on this page, scrolled to the sticky bun picture and then I went to get something. I turned around, and seriously, the sticky bun looked like a FACE. I mean it, clear your mind, turn around fast and look at the bun from 5 feet away. The icing is like a big grinning mouth, and the currants bunched together in the middle  thing is the nose. And the smaller currants are the eyes.

I walked past this place last weekend and while it was super-cute, it is on a rather odd and deserted block, despite being right on a two lane street. I hope people show up, as there doesn't seem to be much foot traffic.I was also afraid to go in as all I could see from the street was a table set for 4 places.

Tina, I serously can't believe how much sugary/fatty/delicious goodness you ingest and you still manage to be the size that you are and to my knowledge, heart disease-free.  I'm truly impressed. :)I'm salivating after seeing that lemony cheesepuff, and that nest is really interesting -- what's it taste like?
thewanderingeater
2007-11-09 22:04:00
Fen: Um, I guess my metabolism is working with me? Thankfully, I'm not huge...yet. I'm buffering it a bit by working out at a gym.The nest is the goat cheesecake. Please re-read that paragraph (two below the photo). If you don't want to do that, think of it as a normal cheesecake (miniature sized) with a sweet-tart kick from the candied kumquats. The nest is made of shredded phyllo dough that makes the crust ethereal rather than substantial like a graham cracker crust. Very delicious indeed.

Surviving the Major Chunk of Midterms: Bouchon, Grandaisy, Prem-On Thai

For the past week, I had three midterms and a ten-page paper due, all crammed within four days. I was suffering with stress that I want to scream in vexation due to my aching head. Isn't college life just awesome? At least I survived the roughest week and there's a little sprinkling of tests for the next two weeks, which the last one would be two days before my birthday. At least my professors spared me of pain and torture on that day. Thankfully.On Monday, I didn't get a chance to eat breakfast at home, so I head over to Bouchon for the sake of having something before I pass out in class due to low blood sugar levels and my need for caffeine since I stayed up 'til 1 AM; having 4 1/2 hours of sleep isn't fun.I know...I said I'll stop going to Bouchon but then again, they're kind of my savior for the week since my stressed mind doesn't want to think where I could eat as well as where I haven't been to.It's freakin' sunny...at 8:15I ended up choosing their Season Danish that contains pureed squash, sweetened with maple syrup. Sounds interesting, hence why I bought it and the requirement of a cup of coffee. As you see from the above and below photos, the natural lighting was very harsh that day, explaining why the food photos look a bit less photogenic than it would be.Awful lightingSeasonal DanishInnardsThe danish was very good. Soft, buttery, slightly chewy, and somewhat flaky danish, swirled with the smooth, almost nutty squash. It's not terribly sweet and nicely spiced with cinnamon and nutmeg, I presume. Interesting take on a danish, when squash is usually used in savory dishes. The coffee, as always, nicely bold, smooth, strong and a bit fruity.After relishing half an hour of peace, I have to skedaddle to class and take a midterm.After classes on Tuesday, I was craving for something sandwich-y. I ended up going to Grandaisy Bakery in SoHo for their sandwiches and dessert for a late lunch...around 2:15.Display caseAs I enter this awesome bakery, they still have sandwiches (since the Sullivan Street Bakery in Hell's kitchen usually makes a batch and stops making more if they ran out when I went there last time), their usual pizzas, delicious loaves of bread, and desserts. But what really caught my eye besides my want of a sandwich was their bread pudding. Yes, after meeting and hanging out with Kathy for a while, her love of bread pudding has rubbed on to me.I spy bread pudding...Since I never had their bread pudding before, I asked the guy behind the counter, \"What's in it?\" He replied, brioche and a couple of other things but then another person intervened and said, \"Just give out a sample.\" So the guy who's helping me, cut out a chunk of bread pudding and handed it out to me. After taking a bite of the dense, creamy, custardy pudding, I told him, \"I'll take one!\" Along with a bresaola sandwich and a bottle of water.Bresaola SandwichInnardsThe sandwich was very delicious. It's light yet filling with a good ratio of filling to bread. The bread was chewy with a touch of crisp crust, the bresaola was paper-thin with the slightest touch of salt from its drying stages, and it's also filled with salty slices of Parmesan cheese and spicy, peppery arugula.Wedge of bread puddingI chompethI usually don't order bread pudding since I know how to make it myself and it's much cheaper to do so. But since Kathy's enthusiasm of bread pudding was somehow whispering in my mind, I wanted it. Anyways, this bread pudding was very delicious, and as I have said earlier, it's just sweet, dense, creamy, with a gelatinous texture from the eggy cubes of bread. For $4, it's quite a generous portion, since after eating my sandwich and this pudding, my stomach felt like I ate a brick. Probably I should have eaten half of it, but I can't help it.Then on Thursday, I visited a new bakery in the Lower East Side, called How Sweet It Is, a new, adorable, precious gem that had opened yesterday that one of the co-owners, Beth told me that last night they just had their Friends & Family event, so this was considered a \"soft opening.\" Especially after what the NY Times article published on Wednesday, which I read and got interested in coming over in the first place. I'll write about it in detail on my next post just because I have too many photos (don't worry, it won't be a 100% photos post).For lunch, I wanted some Thai food since I haven't eaten it in a while. For some reason, I ended up going to Prem-On Thai since I remember reading from Chowhound that they serve good Thai food.Prem-On ThaiSeating InteriorThis place was pretty much empty (except for one table that is occupied except mine) since it is 2:15 in the afternoon, way past the normal lunch hour rush and it's cold and rainy outside. Even though there are only a few diners, it's exempted from silence since there's clubby, dance music playing in the background and to distract the lone waiters and diners, can watch a baseball game that is displayed by the bar.Taking a look at their lunch menu, it's limited but their lunch tops off at $10, all served with the a complimentary appetizer, which isn't so bad. I ended up choosing the Tom Kah Gai and the Pla Rad Prik for lunch.Tom Kah GaiPretty soup, no? This coconut milk-based chicken soup gives a warm feeling to my palate and my body since it was so chilly outside. The soup isn't very heavy with coconut milk, it's just enough for the silky creaminess and for taste. It's spicy enough to feel a slight burn in the back of my throat. The soup also contained white button mushrooms, chopped green and red bell peppers, a few chunks of chicken, and fried garlic sprinkled on top. Not bad but it didn't blow me away.Pla Rad PrikPla Rad Prick - close upThe Pla Rad Prik, which means fish in chili, was served in a pretty presentation, albeit a bit on the small side in portions. This dish is basically fried red snapper fillet lacquered with a garlic-y, tamarind, chili based sauce. It's sweet, savory, spicy, with a touch of sour in every bite. Good, tasty, and not greasy but it doesn't make me swoon.So, that's it for the week. I'll write up about the bakery, How Sweet It Is very soon...Addresses: Bouchon Bakery 10 Columbus Circle, 3rd Floor New York, NY 10019Grandaisy Bakery 73 Sullivan Street New York, NY 10012Prem-On Thai 138 W Houston Street New York, NY 10012

I love bread puddings too! I always thought they were weird things British people ate before WWII, but then my sister made some one time, and it just blew me away how delicious it was.I hope midterms went well, it's always so interesting to catch a glimpse of your \"other\" life.

Dana: Interesting \"other\" life? Really?
It's more like a banal, humdrum kind of life with obstacles that are typically normal... I just don't bother writing much about it since well, my life is 98% boring. The other 2% is the food and friends part that is happy and exciting.

Yeah, your love of bread pudding is contagious! At least my mind (and belly) was sent into a peaceful place as I ate this dessert...until I hit the gym.Just read my post of How Sweet It Is, now;  It's up.

A Quasi-Healthy Lunch at Bouchon and Brunch with People...

***CONTENT
This week or so was pretty much uneventful until yesterday, which I will get to soon. Why? Just because I meant to do that since I'm getting conscious (sorta) of what I'm eating since I joined a gym the past two weeks and I'm thinking to myself, I shouldn't eat that much or I'm working out for almost NOTHING. So, I'm trying to limit myself as to something \"interesting\" for you guys to read about what I'm eating. I know, it's a shame as a food blogger that I'm doing this to myself and in the end, you. But I'll get over it once my birthday and the holidays roll in, where I have absolutely almost no guilt into eating a TON of food to my hardened, cholesterol-clogged heart.Also, I have to tell you a little side note is that I acquired myself a new lens for the interior/zoomed out food photos so...from these photos on, it'll be this lens instead of my dinky little kit lens since I'm fed up with the blurry, low-lit photos that look like utter crap! You're getting more for your viewing pleasure. But I'm still using my usual macro lens for close ups.Now, onto the food... Lunch!It looks somewhat healthy, right? I mean, I think it's relatively healthy instead of eating half a pound of butter (each) that is found from the copious amounts of pastries that I normally would consume from them. I just have their granola parfait and their TKO cookie.Granola ParfaitThe parfait looks healthy but it's quite decadent. The yogurt is very thick like Fage's Greek yogurt. It's tart and very creamy. The crunchy granola also contained pumpkin seeds, both dark and light raisins, and I think there were dried cherries as well. The bottom layer is what I think is lemon preserves or jam of sorts since it's translucent. It's tart, lovely lemon flavor and as I'm thinking back on this, it might be Meyer lemon. Hmmm... The bottom layer is orange marmalade.TKO Bat CookieInnardsThe TKO cookie is a seasonal or holiday version of the normal. It's meant for Halloween, hence the bat shape and it's filled with pumpkin cream. Mmmm...tasty. The chocolate cookies tastes buttery and chocolatey, while the pumpkin cream was nicely spiced with nutmeg, cinnamon, and ginger. I seriously have to stop coming here...even though I like their stuff a lot.For the remainder of the week, I ate \"blah\" food. As in something so diminutive to you people that you won't be interested or it's just doesn't taste that awesome that I don't want to bother with writing. So, we fast forward to yesterday...I ate with people! Not just the usual bunch (e.g. Robyn, Ariel, etc.), I ate with my fellow reader, Jessica and her friend, Adam, while I just invited Ariel for the sake of him trying out this place with me.We all meet up at Fatty Crab for a late brunch or lunch...or whatever you would call it at 2 PM.Since I arrived earlier than the rest, I took a good bit of photos of the interior. It's quite casual with the dimly lit, exposed brick on one wall, while the other is emblazoned with bold red. The music was loud and thumpin' in a good way, that it gives it a cool, youthful vibe with a neighborhood feel of a restaurant.View toward the kitchenView of the room on my leftColorful chopsticks meet brick wallOnce everyone arrived, we all introduced ourselves and started to look at the menu.The MenuAfter chatting a bit and contemplating amongst each other what the heck we want to eat, we eventually decided on the Quail Egg Shooters, Fatty Tea Sandwiches, the Watermelon Pickle and Crispy Pork Salad, the Green Mango Salad, and their house specialty, the Chili Crab.The Green Mango salad arrived first to our table. This salad is composed of crunchy, shredded green mango, chili and bell peppers, bean sprouts, some shredded pineapple, and crushed toasted peanuts to top it all off. Quite tasty. It had a subtle spicy kick at that one would feel in the back of the throat, some tartness from the lime, and a sweet burst from the pineapple. The pineapple was the favored ingredient from the table.Green Mango SaladWhile we're eating our aforementioned salad, the tea sandwiches graced our table. It's done the proper English way, superficially: crustless, untoasted, white bread filled with well, something. But that \"something\" is actually one of the best fillings I've ever encountered in a while, it's slathered with a thick sambal aioli, shreds of pork belly, and cilantro leaves to give it some pungent kick to contrast the strong, heavy flavors of the mayo and pork. Yums.Fatty Tea SandwichesShortly thereafter, the dainty, artfully presented Quail Egg Shooters arrived. Everyone was in awe of that particular dish, and I was struggling to hear the server what were in these eggs since he was on the other side of the table, while the music was blasting. Anyways, from what I observed, these eggs reminded me vaguely of what I had in Le Bernardin a few years ago (the fluke ceviche tasting), where each shot got more complex in flavor as you progress onto the next shot. In terms of the quail eggs, it's complex by adding more toppings. Since I don't have the entire dish to myself, I just ate the second most complex egg shot of the rest (topped with sambal, dried anchovy, I think?, and dried pork floss), while Ariel had the most complex (the kitchen sink of toppings), Jess had the second most (poached quail egg with sambal and a dried anchovy), and Adam had the simplest one that contained the poached egg with a squirt of sambal.So cute and pretty (well, sorta on the latter)!It's soo tiny...We all took our miniature eggs and toasted with them. I don't know why exactly, but Ariel proposed to do so and we all did it without cracking a shell, thankfully.Cheers!If you're wondering how it's like eating that quail egg, it's like eating a poached in its shell, microscopic size of a chicken egg that is still warm and gooey with a touch of saltiness from the pork floss and the dried anchovy, and a touch of spiciness from the sambal. It's very comforting to feel the warm, viscous egg yolk enrobing the entire palate.Moving on to my highlight of the meal, the Watermelon Pickle and Crispy Pork salad. I've read so many praises and many foodies tell me that I must try this dish if I went there so, this was the only dish I was really adamant to be ordered, while there were a few grimaces from the others while we were reading it off the menu. But since it arrived on our table, their minds changed.The seeded watermelon was very juicy and gingery, not the pickle I was thinking of initially, and it finished off with that watermelon sweetness. Eating the crispy pork alone, would make me wonder if it would work well since each chunk was half fat and half meat, and quite charred. The pork meat was a bit dry and overcooked but if one eats it together with the watermelon, then it works out well, since if we had the silky smooth pork flesh, it would compete with the soft, juiciness of the watermelon. Very delicious.Watermelon Pickle and Crispy Pork SaladThen the most expensive item we've ordered from the menu (and it is the most expensive on the menu), is the Chili Crab for the market price of $36. Initially we were all hesitant on getting something with that price tag but I don't mind paying for it, as long as it's worth it. And worth it it was.The Chili CrabChili Crab, close upAs you can see from the above photos, the crab looks (and is) huge! This large crustacean was coated in a red, spicy sauce probably made with sambal, garlic, probably some of the crab's meat and innards, and tomato paste. That sauce alone made me swoon. I don't mind eating buckets of it with some toasted white bread and I'll still be a happy camper...er...diner. Anyways, the crab was obviously a task in itself, while we all hacked, cracked, and forcefully get our meat with bits of shell flying all over the place. But it was fun and we're kind of interacting with our food. The crab tasted a bit dry, in my opinion, since it's been a long time since I ate one. Actually, I haven't eaten a real crab since I accidentally ate one when I was 8 years old and had an allergic reaction to it. But thankfully, after ingesting the small portion of its head and one of its claws, nothing happened except my content belly filled with crab innards, that yummy sauce, and toast.So in case you're wondering who are these people eating with me here are their photos eating...(the best moment of candidness)Jessica!Adam!ArielOnce we're finished eating, we stayed there a bit longer discussing about our lives in general, and Ariel's and Adam's wonderful expeditions outside the country. Eventually the check arrived with a cup filled with little cornbread look a-likes.Dessert of sortsThese little squares are actually corn rice cakes. No, I'm not talking about those dry health food stuff, I'm talking about the glutinous, chewy version of a rice cake. It's packed with corn flavor, not too sweet, and it smells like cornbread. Not bad and interesting flavor choice. After munching away, we've paid the check and walked outside.I've asked Jessica and Adam, what are they going to do afterwards, she said they've been on a bread tasting tour. From what I remember them telling me, they've been to Balthazar and a couple of other bakeries that Adam's quite full now. But since Jess was still determined in trying or finishing out her extensive list that she printed, the next stop would be Amy's Bread. I told her it's very close by, since we're blocks away from Chelsea Market and I had more time hanging out here, so off (the entire group) we went.All of a sudden, my dessert lovin' brain clicked, and I asked everyone, \"Are any you up for gelato?\" Everyone but Adam said, \"Yes\" or some kind of answer that is in the positive. We had a discussion about olive oil gelato with Ariel and how he thinks it's so disgusting that he think we're (as in Jess and I) were freaks for loving it. We argued with him about that for a while and threaten to take him down for that offense. But we let it go...As we approached Chelsea Market, to my initial shock, no one has been there before. I could understand Jess and Adam since they're interning in NYC from Cornell but Ariel? He's been a NYC resident for nearly a decade and somehow, he hasn't been here before. So, I gave them a brief tour of sorts about where my usual shops I would go and led them to the tiny gelato stand, L'Arte Del Gelato which is right inside the Bowery Kitchen store.Most of us were indecisive, sampling a few flavors to make up our minds. Eventually, we all got our desserts and stepped out where there were some standing space in the Market.Jess got herself a small cup of hazelnut and coffee gelatos, which I haven't tried but I ate them before so, I know the flavors are quite potent. Ariel got the biscotti and gianduja; again, I haven't tried but, I had the gianduja last week and it tasted fine. Me, on the other hand, went a bit traditional in flavor pairing: chocolate gelato with a passion fruit sorbet. The chocolate was alright. It's chocolatey but I had a better version at Grom a while back. The passion fruit sorbet was really potent, tart, and smooth. It's a great contrast to the sweet, creamy chocolate.My gelatoJess is eating her gelatoWhy are you at staring me like that?!To explain the caption on the last photo, it should be assumed that Ariel would be jaded with me taking photos of people who I eat with...and he's no exception. But alas, it seems like it's a new thing to him.Once we're done with our dessert we walked over to Amy's Bread for the sake of Jessica's tasting and eventually, parted ways as we all say goodbye and Ariel gave the entire group a bone-crushing bear hug.It was really fun hanging out with everyone! I just wish I had more time before I had to go to a family outing...eh.Addresses: Bouchon Bakery 10 Columbus Circle, 3rd Floor New York, NY 10019Fatty Crab 643 Hudson Street New York, NY 10014L'Arte Del Gelato 75 9th Avenue New York, NY 10011

Awesome post! =) I especially liked the crab dish - made me realize how long it's been since I've had any crab or lobster. The corncakes look exactly like a local hawaiian snack called 'butter mochi'! oohhh man, sooo delish!
we should go sweetbread or gnocchi or spatzle or something-ing with robyn soon! :)

the parfait looks delish - im a big fan of the yogurt parfait - it like eating a bowl of cereal but not...don't know where I'm going with that comparison - but you get the idea.I haven't been hitting up the gym as regularly as usual - perhaps you're making up for my laziness. With any luck I'll be back in action soon.Bday lunch sounds good :)

Kathy: Butter mochi? That sounds a thousand times better than \"corn cakes\" or \"corn rice cakes.\" I hope it's buttery...
Yes! We must go fooding of some sorts with Robyn that has to do with sweetbreads (too many places to name that are pretty good), as for spatzle (go to Cafe Sabarsky, it's very delish). Gnocchi...I haven't tried that many Italian places but the given are Babbo, or any Batali establishment.Jess: Oh, I wish I had more time to do...EVERYTHING. The academic owns me...and eventually the corporate and it all trickles down on to the federal government (via taxes).Doug: Well, it being from Bouchon, it should look pretty! But I know where you're going with the cereal analogy: it's like having a creamy. semi-solid milk with granola \"cereal\" bits on top with a jam surprise on the bottom...or something like that. And waay more tastier than I just said.Eh, with midterms this week, I'm not going to the gym as much as I should...but I'm trying to sneak in an hour or two before classes.Yay! You're coming! :D You can bring your significant other too, ya know...that's if she wants to come.

A pumpkin cream filling? Wow, I need to make that because no one here sells anything similar as a cookie filling.The quail egg shots sound really good. I think the anchovy is a great touch (that and how each progresses), I guess that's because I like anchovies.

The Chocolate Test and A Lesson or Two on Chocolate

For all you chocoholics who happen to love the dark bittersweet 70%-ish variety, this is your post! I've been taking my grand ol' time with these chocolates since I don't want to really kill myself with the sugar, caffeine, and well...chocolate. Trust me, you don't want chocolate to kill your stomach (which happened already) and/or have a psychological lashing like I had with croissants. I like croissants but not as much as I used to after I went bonkers with them last year and it took me nearly 5 months to get back on eating them. Anyways, back to the chocolate...As some of you know, Robyn did me a favor while she was in Italy a couple of weeks ago to pick up some Amedei chocolate when I read this article on the Interwebs while she was overseas. What she got me were three 70% cacao content bars, two of them are single origin bars (the Porcelana and Chuao) while the other was their signature blend (La Tavoletta).The chocolate!The test I'm only reporting to you are comparing the La Tavoletta bar with the five other brands that have something very close to the 70% cacao range and is a blend. After scouring Manhattan for elusive 70%-ish chocolate bars, I ended up purchasing five bars. (I limited myself to a total of six for this particular tasting just because my stomach could take so much chocolate and how my wallet could take the hit of buying so many chocolate bars.) The Scharffen Berger and Green & Black's were found in Whole Foods on Bowery, the Valrhona was bought in Fairway in the Upper West Side, Marie Belle's bar was found in its namesake shop in SoHo, and likewise for the Michel Cluizel 72% Noir bar.I chose these bars mainly because of its reputation since Valhrona and Michel Cluizel are the ones who usually tops at any chocolate tasting publication; Scharrfen Berger to see if it can be as respectable as the European brands (since it is American, based in San Francisco), and Green & Black's for the sake of it being organic (arguing that it being organic, would it affect the taste and texture of the chocolate?).The bars to be tested...So what I did for each bar was to leave them at room temperature, which wasn't so difficult since that's how I store my chocolate (unless it's the peak of summer, obviously), break apart each bar into a portion that is reasonable to taste or if it's sectioned off by the manufacturer, the latter made my life a bit easier. As I was hacking and breaking apart the chocolate, I paid attention to how the chocolate looked and snapped.I know you're wondering why the heck would I do that? Well, in order for you, the chocoholic who genuinely appreciates chocolate, should notice how well these chocolates were tempered. Tempering gives chocolate a shiny gloss, structure, and that \"snap\" whenever you bite, chop or any physical damage inflicted to the poor bar. You can tell a bar that was not tempered properly when it looks dull, matte, and it's soft to the bite. So here's what the chocolate looks like before I munched on them. Just click on the photo to see the names of the individual pieces.The sampling plateOnto the tasting... So here's my procedure for each chocolate piece. Pick up a piece of chocolate and hold it near your nose until you smell the aroma and pay attention to what your sniffing there. That's your key to what you will taste. It can be earthy, coffee-like, florally, woody (believe it or not), berry-like, or just good unadulterated chocolate.Take a small bite and let it melt and coat your tongue with that chocolate. Unless you are really voracious and took a big bite, chew it but DON'T SWALLOW! Just coat that viscous sludge all over your palate and pick out the flavors you're tasting. Does it taste like coffee? Wine? Flowers or roses? Berries? Is it too sweet or bitter? Feel or taste how the flavors change for the next the few moments. It should feel like an ethereal wave of flavors gently caressing your tongue; there should be a beginning, a peak, and an end.Is there any aftertaste after you swallowed? In regards to aftertaste, it's better to have almost no aftertaste lingering on your palate. That's how you should \"taste\" chocolate. If you're confused about what the hell I'm talking about, just click here for something with numerical steps.The Analysis Ok, so you're either munching on chocolate right now or you're just a lazy bum and expect me to tell you? Well, you're correct on the latter. I'm telling you what I tasted and what I really liked or detest from these six bars.Starting off with the Marie Belle (I picked it randomly), it overall did fine. There was a slight \"snap\" after cutting a bar (with a chef's knife) that was quite thick. The appearance was slightly glossy, an even, dark brown color, and the strange indentations throughout the bar. I don't really understand why, but perhaps they have the intention of melting it down to hot chocolate? Anyways, it tasted a bit earthy initially, then it changed to a slightly acidic fruitiness, with a touch of nut flavor (probably from the machines that processed this chocolate), and vanilla. It had a slight bitter aftertaste that lingered for about 5 seconds. Texturally, it was creamy, viscous, maybe velvety. Not particularly my favorite but it wasn't bad.Box of the Marie Belle barMarie Belle \"Hot Chocolate\" BarNow, the focus of the tasting, Amedei's La Tavoletta bar. It strangely smells like grapes and chocolate was as the background. It tasted like raisins, and wine (like dark red fruits such as plums kind of peak out), with a hint of chocolate liqueur and coffee. It's definitely smooth, fudgey, and creamy. This is terribly good chocolate.La Tavoletta BarLa Tavoletta Bar, unwrappedThe biggest disappointer of the entire tasting was Green & Black's. The bar smells woody and a faint whiff of raisins. At the bite/melting stage, the woody taste builds up harshly on the palate to a strong tannic profile. It's really bitter. It then slowly finishes with a musty, earthy flavor. Texturally, this bar was smooth and fudge-like but more along the lines of like licking a spoon of peanut butter, if you know what I mean...and I had to drink as much liquids like I was licking off a spoon of peanut butter (about three glasses of water). The astringent flavors clings unmercifully onto my palate! The bitterness went out of control and they really need to mellow it out more than a couple of notches to make it palatable.Green & Black's Dark 70% barGreen & Black's Dark 70% bar, unwrappedFor a change for the better, I went for Michel Cluizel's \"Noir 72%\" chocolate. Starting with the sniff test, this chocolate had berry and coffee scents, highlighting the chocolate. Taking a bite, initially, it had a fruity burst, plateauing to the pure essence of chocolate then finish it off with a nice black coffee flavor. Texturally this was divine: melt-in-your-mouth creamy, perfectly smooth. No lingering aftertaste. The entire symphony lasted mere seconds that I want to hang on to it like it was a memorable first kiss. Gah! That was really good and dreamy...Michel Cluizel Noir 72%Michel Cluizel Noir 72%, unwrappedThen I made a turn from the European brands (since G&B is based in the U.K.) and go to America, as in Scharrfen Berger. Getting a whiff of their chocolate is pretty darn appetizing: scents of fruits and berries, and a touch of coffee. Taking the typical nibble, it tastes like coffee: dark and earthy at the midpoint, closing with a touch of sweet berries and return to coffee. No aftertaste detected. It's not bad for an American chocolate company that's dominated with huge corporations (e.g. Hershey's, even though Scharffen has been bought by them...).Scharffen Berger 70%Scharffen Berger's 70% chocolate bar unwrappedAnd last and certainly not least, Valrhona. One of the most recognized French chocolate companies around. It had a light floral scent, maybe a hint of herbs. It's very \"crisp;\" good mild chocolate flavor (arguably, it doesn't taste like a 70% cacao bar), with light floral note like jasmine or rose. The floral flavors were gently caressing my palate; not harsh at all. It all finished with a chocolate note. This bar is not meant for the ones who love that strong, in-your-face, deep chocolate punch. It's more geared as a good introduction to 70% range chocolates and goes well with wine due to it's characteristics.Valrhona \"Le Noir Amer\" 71% barSo that's the end of the tasting...if you have no idea what to think in terms of ranking based on my comments, here it is (from best to worst).1. Michel Cluizel's \"Noir\" 72% 2. Amedei \"La Tavoletta\" 70% 3. Valrhona \"Le Noir Amer\" 71% 4. Scharffen Berger 70% It's alright...but not very notable: Marie Belle \"Dark Hot Chocolate\" Save your tastebuds...(and money) from this: Green & Black's \"Dark\" 70%To those of you wondering if I ate all of the chocolate? No, I have not. I now have a huge stockpile of chocolate that I might be planning to whip a batch of the most decadent chocolate cake I have ever seen, made, and tasted in my life. It's truly foodgasmic to the dark chocolate lover. It's been nearly two years since I've made that actually...maybe I should make it for meself for my birthday soon.

Thanks for post! You're truly saving my taste buds, and not to mention my wallet, some major work. The only non-milk chocolate I ever tried was Green and blacks, and I found it uneatable. I thought it was just me since I usually eat milk chocolate, but I'm glad to see there's better options out there. I suppose I'll get some scharffen bergers since they're widely available. I'm glad you included some american brands since I don't think I've seen any of the european brands you tested around here (new haven).

Yeah, I don't like Green & Black's as you can see from my tasting.Ooh...really? Well, I guess you can try to scour your local gourmet supermarket (if you have one) and hope to find some European chocolates.Giulia: LOL! Definitely try the Amedei if you can get your hands on it and Michel Cluizel! Maybe I should get you some for Christmas instead? Methinks and schemes...

Interesting.  I like G&B's a lot (maybe they changed ever since they got bought out too?)  Valrhona's one of my fav brands, but I can't stomach the 71% blend.  It tastes like cumin or something.  Not a fan of Scharffen Berger.  I like some of the Michel Cluizels, but the single-origin bars are crumbly to me.  Haven't tried Amedei, but now I'll have to get a bar!

A Fun Outing with Robyn's Posse and the Pork Stupor Dinner

***CONTENT
On Saturday, Robyn invited me and a bunch of her friends to her extremely belated birthday dinner (since her birthday was on late August). I honestly have to say, this was my highly anticipated event of the season. I mean, you're hanging out with the coolest and funnest food bloggers and her friends, and eating a huge hunk of pork, which will be spoken about later. On another note why I am saying it's a highly anticipated event it's because it's my first time eating at Momofuku Ssäm for dinner; I hang my head down in shame for being the smallest minority who is a New Yorker, foodie, and a food blogger. It's an embarrassment.Since I was free around 3 PM, I texted and called Robyn if she's out in the city before the dinner, she called me and said yes, she's already visiting one of her friends at work in SoHo. She's planning to meet another friend, Alex (who happened to be a vegetarian) soon, at the Spring Street stop. As I hauled my butt downtown, there's a huge confusion in the subways where the E train doesn't take the normal route of going to Spring Street and the C train goes express, (which I took since the announcement from the conductor of the E train said so earlier) and ended up in the Canal Street stop, where it borderlines TriBeca and Chinatown. Ugh, Don't I just love the subways systems here...I called Robyn again for apologizing for taking so long and told her about the whole conundrum. At least Alex hasn't shown up yet, so I'm not that late. Eventually I walked up to her area, we chatted, and she gave me the gift of macarons. They're not Pierre Herme but she said that they're better than Bouchon's. I trust her palate wholeheartedly since she's now considered a supertaster but beyond that, she's the one who introduced me to the transcendent world of macarons. Oh, how I would love to go back to that teary-eyed feeling of bliss again... Anyways, she got these from work, which is Serious Eats, where they got a mail order from Mad Mac (just click here for an idea of what they look like in packaged form). I didn't take any photos since it got crushed in my bag by the time I got home. So, I'll spare you people from seeing squished, colorful confetti of macarons crumbs.We eventually met a reader, Caroline, who stopped near us and went off excitedly about reading our blogs and she's thrilled to meet us. We're totally happy that she loves our blogs. I'm still not used to this celebrity thing, even though I'm almost a complete nobody in comparison to Robyn. Anyways, it's really nice to meet her. So, Hi Caroline! :)Alex eventually surprised Robyn (then me from her scream) when he took a photo of her when he arrived. Happy hugs exchanged between them and she also gave the gift of macarons to Alex. Instead of calling her \"the girl who ate everything\" probably I should call her \"the chocolate and macaron fairy.\" Since her past few trips to Europe she brought me either of those things...Anyway, after greetings were exchanged, we're all generally hungry due to the vast pork-centric dinner therefore tried not to eat that much, but Robyn wanted to feed Alex with some delicious bread from Grandaisy Bakery. We love bread...We all bought a slice of pizza (not the usual slice you're thinking of; we're talking about Roman-style) and started to nosh away. Robyn had this ginormous slice of Bianca (incredibly for the low cost of $1), Alex tried out the zucchini and a cookie, and I had the Bianca con pecorino.Robyn talking to AlexRobyn's sliceMy pizzaBubbly textureThere's something so darn tasty about Grandaisy's (and Sullivan Street, which tastes the same but different owners for each) bread. It's chewy, great flavor, and pretty darn inexpensive, especially for Robyn's Bianca. It would've been more delicious if they were fresh out of the oven.Eventually, I shared my caramel apple that I bought from Bouchon Bakery that morning since I ran out of coffee at home and I needed a cup before my classes. Anyways, Robyn and I were skeptical about cutting that apple in half with a plastic knife since we were assuming that the apple would be very crisp and the caramel coating is hard. However, it was pretty much the opposite. The caramel was chewy and the apple was semi-soft.Caramel apple, unwrappedIt's in halfThe apple had a heady floral scent besides smelling like an apple (which I'm guessing it's a Gala?). The caramel was very buttery and the peanut coating was actually a bit soft. Not bad but a bit pricey for what I paid for this apple ($8.50).To give you the idea that the caramel is gooey, look at the photo below.Blooper shotAfter we're done eating, we walked around SoHo for the sake of killing time and waiting for another friend of Robyn's, Charlie, coming down from New Haven, CT. As we walked out, we discussed about doing another round of \"jumping photos\" that Robyn's doing a lot of lately, that's if there were any open spaces to do so. I had a spark of hope since every time I look at her \"jumping photos\" it looks like a ton of fun. Anyhow, we walked down Spring Street and Alex noticed this store whose entrance is emblazoned with graffiti, which is named Kiosk. We went upstairs and by the time we were on the landing, it smelled like food and once we went in that tiny store (more like a room), and basically sell international toys or goods. On our way down the stairs, Robyn and I noticed this psychedelically decorated portion of the wall with the word, \"SUCK\" on it and took a photo.KioskSUCK!In time, we walked over to UNIQLO since Alex was kind of looking for a knee-length peacoat that he's been wanting. So, we're doing more window shopping and Robyn and I eventually became his \"equipment holders\" (he brought a camera and a small bag) as he tried on a few coats.He's stylin'Around five o'clock, Charlie called Robyn, telling her that he's in SoHo! Since he's not too familiar with the geography down here and I said out loud that there's an Adidas store nearby where he's located, she told Charlie to wait in front of that store and we'll walk over to meet him.The groupAfter greetings were exchanged and I introduced myself, Charlie gave Robyn her birthday present. She opened it later on and turned out to be a gift certificate to Frank Pepe's Pizzeria. Awesome. She'll be eating a couple of pizzerias out in Connecticut soon enough...We walked into the Adidas store since Alex was looking for a particular red sneaker, so we all went in to casually search for it. The funniest thing that Charlie said as Alex heading toward the sneaker section, he said, \"Go! Go look for your material wealth!\" OMG. Funny. Ok, maybe not to you but if you were there you'll be laughing out loud. Eventually Alex's quest for his sneaker ended in defeat, we walked around SoHo to let time pass by even more.When it's about forty minutes until her reservation/dinner time, we all decided to go to our destination of the night, Momofuku Ssäm Bar. Since I was heeled boots, I was complaining that I don't want to walk our way up since it's quite a distance to go but Alex stated we should walk. Just to save my feet for the rest of the night, I changed to my sneakers before we continue our way uptown.As we were around the Whole Foods on Houston, Charlie started to complain, \"Who's idea was it to walk?\" But eventually we arrived to the temple of pork (Momofuku Ssäm) and meet Robyn's brother, Hubert at the front. As the time closes toward 6, most of the party-goers have arrived, we all went in. Not surprisingly since it was a Saturday night, the place was packed...and really loud with the chatter of other diners and the music that was playing in the background. When we got seated we all (as in 7 of us at the moment) looked at the menu and start talking about the food. We also saw Chef David Chang working in the kitchen.The menuChef David ChangEventually, everyone but Carol arrived before we made a final decision on what we're ordering, which took another ten minutes since we don't want to kill ourselves with so much food before the bo ssäm. So here goes the feast...Santa Barbara UniWe started off with the Santa Barabara uni with whipped tofu, tapioca, and scallions. It was really silky and fresh since it tasted like the briny ocean. The tapioca pearls added a chewy dimension and the scallions gave off a subtle onion-y nuance to the dish. The green flecks on top were dried, salty seaweed, which gave it some added flavor. Very delicious.Bread and ButterShortly afterwards, the large platter of Bread and Butter had arrived. We ordered this mainly for the sake of Alex's vegetarianism since we know that he won't be eating the pork butt or anything that is touched or laced with a flavor of an animal. The thin baguette was toasted and it's served with sea salt butter from Vermont and St. Helen's Farm goat's butter, hailing back to England. I only tried the sea salt butter and it was quite good. But it's strange that this plate cost $8. Probably we should have asked for more bread to justify the price tag a bit.Fried CauliflowerWhile most of us were nibbling the bread, the arrival of two orders of Satur Farms Fried Cauliflower ($11 each) bestowed upon our table. This dish was flavored with mint, fish sauce, and chilies. After I took a bite of the cauliflower, I was blown away. The subtle flavor of mint, mingled with the salty fish sauce and chilies worked so well. I think there was some garlic, if my palate serves me well... Anyways, I thought to myself if there were any cauliflower-haters, this would totally make them a convert. Yet the argument would be that it's fried, so it won't count as a vegetable anymore but it's some tasty junk food veggie.Chawan MushiWe shared the small order of Tello's Chawan Mushi ($16). To tell you honestly, I never had this dish before but after this was explained by Robyn and Kathy after we ordered it earlier, I know what they're talking about. This creamy egg custard tasted like bacon, probably due to the smoked trout roe that topped this dish. The touch of sweetness from the maple syrup was a nice offset to the salinity of the trout roe. It's quite dainty for its price.Next up was a plate of Grilled Sweetbreads served with a side of pickled roasted chilies and lime ($14).The Plate of Grilled Veal SweetbreadsMacro of pickled veggiesGrilled Sweetbreads, close upI never had sweetbreads grilled before, usually the preparation goes along the lines of having them pan-fried or seared. The char gave off a smoky flavor and the texture was creamy and soft on the inside. The lime was a necessity since it added another layer of flavor and acidity that changes the entire dish. If one ate it as is, the sweetbreads will taste a little bit boring.The kitchen nearly forgotten to serve us our plate of Roasted Mushroom Salad ($16) and thankfully it appeared. Again, the portions was still on the small side but it's still quite tasty. The mushrooms worked really well with the pistachio purée since both are generally earthy flavors. The radishes add a crunchy texture to the soft, chewy mushrooms and the crosnes look like insect larvae. I know the latter description isn't appealing but I don't think anyone could deny it but at least it doesn't taste like one...not like I ever ate larvae nor do I want to eat one.Mushroom SaladClose up of mushroom saladAnd finally, the pièce de résistance of the evening...the Bo Ssäm ($180)! What they actually do was set up the stage in preparation of the arrival of this magnificent slab of meat. They've brought out a large bowl of Bibb lettuce and four sauces (kochujang, scallion and ginger purée, kimchi purée, and regular kimchi) at both ends of the table, three small bowls of rice, and a dozen Glidden Point oysters to accompany the pork. On a side note, Carol finally made it to the party!Bibb lettuce and condimentsBowl o' riceA dozen oystersTo let you know what is bo ssäm is, it is basically the whole pork butt (which is pork shoulder), all five pounds of roasted meaty, fatty glory. And it finally graced our table...BO SSAM!!Since its presence cannot be denied, most of our table whipped out our cameras and start snapping photos of this legendary, beautiful, roasted meat. Amy was the first to have the guts to grab the tongs and start the pulling off the meat. Oh it was wonderful to see how the meat lifts off with such ease.The carnage of meeaatt...Then everyone else (but Alex, unfortunately) started to join in and start participating in the porcine feast. Now, to complete the whole idea of what one is supposed or can do with the condiments mentioned earlier, you grab a lettuce leaf, put in some pulled pork meat onto the leaf, pile on some rice, plop on an oyster and a condiment of choice, roll up and eat. For me, I didn't eat the oyster (because I'm allergic) and I didn't try the kochujang sauce (because I forgot and it's far away from me). My favorite sauce of the four was the ginger and scallion purée. It's something about the onion flavor and the gentle spiciness of the ginger that made my palate happy with the rich pork. Rice was a necessity for the pork to subdue the strong, in-your-face pork flavor.When we were about a pound away from finishing the entire shoulder, people are slowing their eating speed a couple of notches, Robyn said, \"We can finish this. There isn't much left.\" We agreed and a few of us kept going until we have about half, Robyn was playing around with that piece and I said, \"Eat it.\" She replied to me, \"That's a lot of pork!\" But then a few of us started to chant to Robyn, \"Eat it! Eat it! Eat it!\" But she ended up taking a little more than half of that piece. The remainders went to everyone else in the table. But...we actually finish it (sans a large blob of fat that we don't want to ingest).The remains...or lack ofMentally I thought to myself, \"Good job everyone!\" After we're done with the pork, we started to talk about dessert and that was gelato. Yes, our love with creamy, frozen desserts are held near and dear to us. Since there aren't that many gelato places in the city that are great as what Robyn has eaten in her adventures in Paris and Italy, we thought about going to either Grom or L'Arte del Gelato. The latter prevailed since it's generally closer to the restaurant.After we paid the check (and it went a bit crazy and strenuous with calculations probably due to the onset of pork stupor), we walked out of the restaurant and wanted to have a group photo. Fortunately, no one is excluded since there was a woman who stopped near our group and volunteered to take a photo of us with Robyn's camera. So here what we looked like post-dinner...(Just click on the photo for the names of everyone. It's borrowed from Robyn's Flickr photostream.)Group Photo!We all then moved as a group and trekked our way to 7th Avenue to L'Arte del Gelato. We bid Amy farewell on the way since she told Robyn that she had Pinkberry's fro-yo earlier, so she already fulfilled her frozen dessert quota for the day. Anyway, we eventually made it and it's quite busy for a slightly chilly night but hey, it's Saturday and people want to go out and eat and mingle.Gelato!After thinking for a while what flavors I want to try, I eventually got meself a small cup with pistachio and Nutella. The pistachio is creamy, nutty, and it doesn't look or taste artificial. The Nutella was just fine: hazelnut with about a 50%-ish cacao content, and not too sweet.My cupWe started to eat inside the shop, until it got a bit too crowded with the incoming of people and the rest of our group got their sweets so we went outside.Kathy and Robyn eating indoorsWe migrated...Robyn and her broI found out soon enough was that Alex didn't really eat much from Momofuku. He only ate the bread and butter, nothing else besides that besides a glass of wine. It turned out he didn't eat the fried cauliflower due to the fish sauce. We tried to persuade him earlier that fish sauce doesn't exactly taste like fish but I guess it didn't work. I guess the gelato made up the lack of food for his evening. He's one heck of a friend to actually put up with a mostly non-vegetarian dinner. That's a lot of love and loyalty. Props to you, Alex.Eventually, I bid farewell to Robyn and her posse since I had to get home. Oh fun times...I just wish I could linger longer with them.Addresses: Grandaisy Bakery 73 Sullivan Street New York, NY 10012Momofuku Ssäm Bar 207 2nd Avenue New York, NY 10003L'Arte del Gelato 75 7th Avenue New York, NY 10011

We didn't linger long after you left.  YOU MISSED NOTHING!Oh wait, I took a jumping photo..or did you see that?  I'm waiting for Alex to upload his photos.  Rawr.Thanks for writing your blog post so QUICKLY!  At the rate I'm going, I'll write about it sometime next month.  Maybe.  Eek.Everything at Momofuku is dainty for the price.  :[  But it's so good. I can see why people go there so much...if they're rolling in the monies.  I could've gone to a really upscale restaurant for the same money, but Momofuku is...a comfortable place to eat.  Feels more fun.OH BUT WE SHOULD GO DESSERTING AT wd-50 YES.Man that pork was so good.  Why is it so good?  So gooooood?  I can still taste it.I didn't realize how little Alex ate until after dinner, I think.  -__-  You're right, he needs major props. I might have to bake him a batch of cookies or something to make up for the caloric loss.  But he'll probably only eat one cookie and then be full.

Oh no, poor Alex! He probably could have eaten the pickle plate by himself, or the apple salad (without the bacon), or the apple kimchi (without the jowl), or more of the mushroom salad.
Robyn
2007-10-15 14:02:00
ALEX REFUSED THE PICKLE..__.What Alex enjoys: bread and macarons.  And pizza.I don't think he'll eat things that touch bacon.  He'll only relieve himself of his vegetarianismmm if he gets to eat at El Bulli.

Yeah but for the apple kimchi and apple salad, you can probably ask that they make it without the bacon. Did you guys talk to any of the servers about vegetarian options?

Jeebus, this is becoming a discussion forum between us three. Anyways....Robyn: YES! I LOVE THE PORK BUTT! I'm still dreaming of it...*sighs* But at least I knew I didn't gain weight from that night. Phew.You did a jumping photo?! What?! Now, I'm deprived of fun. :(We should definitely do desserting at wd-50! But not this month since I have midterms. (NOO...!)Kathryn: Yes, we all feel bad for Alex. :(
Why can't he give up a night of vegetarianism for awesome pork?! Eh, we can't force him so...No, we didn't talk about vegetarian options since well, it's a tad overlooked. Ok, we (I should say, \"I,\" since I don't know if Robyn's thinking what I'm thinking) totally forgotten to ask since I'm assuming a bit too much from the kitchen and kinda hoping Alex would consume the fried cauliflower.If you're reading this Alex, I'M SORRY!! It's not totally my fault! I think...?
Robyn (not from Jacksonville)
2007-10-15 21:18:00
I kind of assumed they wouldn't do veg since the menu says...\"- no substitutions or special requests\"
\"- we do not serve vegetarian friendly items\"But then it says \"please let us know if you have any food allergies.\"  \"YES I AM ALLERGIC TO PORK!\"  Okay, that probably wouldn't work.I guess this will be a less for the future: they will make things sans pork?!

it was so awesome bumping into you and robyn, i still can’t get over that i recognized you two and that you were together! you guys seriously have the best blogs - I read them when i have down time at work and they make me want to play hooky and go eat. thanks for the shout out! :) and tina - no worries. i too am embarrassed to say that i still haven’t been to momofuku ssam - it’s def on my “next” list.

Robyn: I see a bleak future for vegetarians eating at Momofuku...So sad for Alex's case...so sad. :(In regards to your first comment, you're welcome on blogging so quickly. :)  I just can't help it. How can I shut up and not write about something so tasty?Caroline: No problem on the shout out. It's just appropriate to actually say \"hi\" whenever I meet a reader who has the guts to meet someone like me...who sometimes (I think) give off a \"don't bother me\" vibe.Yay! I'm a distraction from work...oh wait, that's not a good thing. hehe....oh. Just whenever you have a day off, just try one of the myriad of places we both tried. There's so much to choose!

ohmygoooshness!!!!!!! SOOOOOOOO delicious, that dinner!!! :) I think my favorite part of the meal were the SWEETBREADS. Holey moley, we totally have to take Robyn sweetbread-ing one of these day, can't believe it was her first time! :)I agree with you on the bread and butter part - the $8 price tag was really uncessary (even though the butter was ridiculously delish! :)*Thanks for putting up the post so quickly!! It brought back fond memories even before they've had a chance to fade, lol. And oh man, the cauliflower!!! I can smell it NOW! :)

Kathy: Oooh! Brilliant idea to go sweetbreading. Not exactly healthy but whatevs. The best version I've ever tried so far was from Jean Georges. Ugh...I want to eat there again.Charlie: Wuzzup, man! Anyways, I never heard of sweetbread tacos before. Ok, I have but I'm skeptical of eating one.PB & pizzookies?! Sounds good to me.

I don't think they'll make things without pork but there are things where the pork can be easily picked off.What are you doing taking a vegetarian there anyway!?I thought the Bo Ssam was more like 10 lbs. of meat. Mmmm, meat.

A Civilized, Casual Lunch at The Maze at the London

On Tuesday, I went to the London Hotel trying to get a taste of what Gordon Ramsay's kitchen is capable of. Beyond his brash TV personality, he is an accoladed chef in London (the only person to have 3 stars in Guide Michelin, I'm talking about the original French guide, not the controversial New York guide that has a few food writers boiling). I've read a lot of good things about the The Maze saying that it has pretty delicious food and the service trumps The Bar Room at the Modern recently from reading the Chowhound boards, I might as well give it a whirl.Since my lunch was around 2 PM, it's not really surprising to know that there aren't that many diners eating there with the exception of business lunch meetings that has been extended with their own conversations, the European tourists who having a ball due to the shrinking American dollar, and the lone diners like me, are trying out the food.Viewing toward the barInteriorAs the hostess walked me to my table, several waiters and bus boys were kindly welcoming me to this restaurant and inquired if I wanted anything to drink, etc. Strangely, the menu hasn't been brought to me until minutes after I got my glass of tap water.The menuI've viewed The Maze's menu via their website and I was actually hoping that they would serve a la carte since some of their prix fixe options were a little less intriguing than desired. Regardless to what I'm hoping for, it's a prix fixe lunch only. From their options, I've chosen the chicken liver and foie gras parfait, Gilthead bream with with native lobster risotto, and for dessert, a Valhrona chocolate fondant. After I told him my order, he stated that, \"The bread will be brought over to me soon.\" I thought it was odd that he announced that frivolous statement since it's usually implied in a fine dining establishment. In a few minutes, another person appeared before me with a large silver tray with a silver tin of sliced baguettes and butter on a thin, shale plate.Bread and buttaButterBread tin; macroThe baguette slices were served warm (a huge plus) and it tastes addictively good. It tastes like it's been toasted with melted butter and salted right before serving, hence the light yellow hue that is present. Add on a pat of soft, room temperature butter, I'm in a temporary state of bliss.Not too soon, my first course has arrived, the chicken liver and foie gras parfait, herb salad and toasted brioche. Usually, I'm not a fan of chicken liver because of it's strange gamy flavor that never appealed to me when I was a child. But since the use of foie in there, it toned down the off-taste a bit and adds a luxuriously creamy, mousse-like texture to the parfait. I don't really see the point of the addition of the \"herb salad\" when it's actually more like a small pile of frisée that doesn't really add anything to the dish; unless they are trying to balance out the fattiness of the parfait with something slightly healthy. The sweet apple chutney was a good addition though.First CourseFoie!Creamy textureWanna bite?After taking a while to eat the appetizer, since I practically took a hundred photos, the entrée has arrived. The Gilthead bream was perfectly cooked: sautéed the fish until the skin was ethereally crisp with the flesh still moist and intact. The lobster risotto was tasty from the sweet, tiny chunks of lobster cooked with the creamy, salty risotto rice combined with lemon grass and Thai basil to add some bright notes to contrast the sweetness of the dish. It's good but not particularly inspiring.Gilthead breamMacro shotThen came my dessert, a Valhrona chocolate fondant with a sphere of green cardamom caramel, sea salt and almond ice cream. In ways, I was expecting a bit more than what was presented before me. Personally, this dessert was a bit underwhelming. The chocolate fondant was the textbook type: a partially baked, gooey chocolate cake. The ice cream fared a tad better, considering the interesting flavor combinations. It tasted like eating a creamy, caramel ice cream with a shot of saltiness to highlight the sweetness of the ice cream with a touch of roasted almonds. The cardamom flavor was practically muted.Valrhona chocolate fondant, green cardamom caramel, sea salt and almond ice creamFondantBall of ice creamMelty...After finishing my dessert and wanting nothing else beyond that since I felt full, I asked for the check and paid it. However, the unexpected thing that occurred while I was waiting for them to process my payment, was that a server presented me some petit fours: small dishes of truffles and peanut brittle. I don't remember reading about this from any blog or review...but hey, it's gratis, so why not enjoy them?The truffles were actually filled with salted caramel with some kind of roasted nut. The chocolate itself tasted somewhere along the lines of 62% cacao; not too bad overall. The peanut brittle was slightly less brittle than it should be due to the moist air that day since it's so cloudy. It tasted good though; the thick, sweet, slightly salty, burnt sugar candy filled with chunks of roasted peanuts. Quite good. Frankly, I might as well have these instead of the chocolate fondant that I had earlier.The checkPetit foursTruffles...not the fungusInnardsPeanut brittleGoing back to the beginning of this post, the service was overall friendly and attentive, a bit more than Mr. Meyer's establishment, The Bar Room at the Modern, after eating there twice. In terms of food, it's good but it doesn't send me to food bliss to the umpteenth exponent. I still think Jean Georges still rules in terms of food, overall.Address: The Maze at the London The London NYC Hotel 151 W 54th Street New York, NY 10019

Did you have a reservation for lunch or did you just walk in?  I've been meaning to try this place for some time now.BTW I love your blog and have been quietly reading it for the past year.  Thanks for the great pictures and reviews- I look forward to it every week!  I hope you don't mind but I put a link to your website on my blog.

the gratis sweets at the end looked to be bigger than the actual dessert lol. I heard of this being done at very upscale places, but this has never ever happened to me in NYC. But then I don't think i've ever went anywhere near the level of THe Maze

Dana: Oh jeebus...no, the title doesn't really refer to my other food outings as \"barbaric,\" I'm referring to Chef Ramsay's antithetical TV personality, since he's so brash, rude, and mean on TV, but his restaurant is actually refined and friendly (as in the staff).The gratis sweets did add up to be more than the dessert, which was a bummer. It even tasted better than the dessert itself. I guess that;s their redeeming factor when it comes to the sweets department.

A Note to the chocoholics: To those of you who have seen my \"tasting\" photos earlier the past weekend, I will not be posting that anytime soon since I recently finished three bars of chocolate (and my stomach's hurting because of that), I want to pace myself eating these chocolates and I can do whatever I want since this is my blog! BWHAHAHAHA... Ahem. No, I'm not trying to be mean. I don't want to have a chocolate backlash and I want to be thorough in what the heck I'm tasting from these chocolates (and I realized when I started that I'm tasting them the wrong way initially, until I read a few articles about how to taste chocolate, I'll explain when I post about the tasting).If you really want to know what I tasted so far, it's the Amedei \"La Tavoletta\", Marie Belle's Dark 70% Hot Chocolate, Green & Black's 70% Dark, and Michel Cluizel \"Noir\" 72% bar. Some fared better than others obviously, but I won't tell you the results until I'm done with all of the \"blends.\" That might be around next week or so for me to publish that since I'm going to attend and write about Robyn's party this weekend! Woohoo! Now onto what happened the past Saturday...It's been ages since I've seen my long lost best friend, Stacey. We've known each other since junior high school in eighth grade, went our own ways since high school but kept in contact each other by old fashioned snail mail to the the modern age of Facebook. Oh how times have changed...We've finally made a lunch date the past Saturday at meet up at Lombardi's. Yes, we're craving for some PIZZA!\"Best Pizza in the World\"When we were requesting a table for two, the host sent us to the other side of the restaurant, which entails us to walk to the back, through the kitchen and out to the other room. Weird.Once we got seated and perused the menu, we discussed what toppings we want on our pizza. After talking for five minutes, we finally agreed on having a small with garlic and sausage. After we relayed that to our waitress, we chatted and catch up what the heck has been going on for the past several years since we've seen each other in the flesh (i.e. dating life, future plans, etc.). But we got interrupted due to the presence of pizza...PIZZA!Another viewClose upDoesn't it look delicious? The fresh, creamy mozzarella cheese, topped with chiffonades of basil, chopped garlic, and sweet Italian sausage and a thin, blistered crust to boot...good god, my stomach was growling at the sight of it.When I actually took a bite of this pizza, it was pretty good but not the best pizza I've ever eaten. The crust was fine; it's thin enough to support the weight of the toppings. There's a good ratio of sauce, cheese and toppings but it's just something about the flavors and the saltiness of the pizza (where it lacked a bit) that didn't make my eyes glaze into delirium and exclaim, \"OMG...This is delicious!\" It's more like, \"It's good... At least it didn't suck.\"My sliceUpskirtOh, here's a photo of Steaky! You on the other hand, will have to call her Stacey. I have rights to call her that nickname since we've known each other for a long time and she actually dubbed each other food nicknames. In case you're wondering what she lovingly calls me, well...maybe you have to email me for that.Steaky!After we're done with our pizza, we walked around SoHo aimlessly and stumbled upon a really cute store, Pylones, where all animals are made into something functional for us, humans. Whether it maybe a fish lighter, tape dispenser, or even a kitchen timer. Or things besides animals that have messages of politically-off humor and whatnot. Yep, I would have a ball shopping for stuff here despite the fact that it doesn't really go with any stuff I own.Cute stuffWent to Vosges Haut Chocolat since she did mention about her recent love affair with bacon. She wouldn't mind having a huge pile of them for breakfast. Yet I still wonder how can she be the same tiny person after all these years... I ended up getting a Mo Bar and shared it with her. She was skeptical with this flavor combo but I promised her that it's really good. She hesitantly takes a piece, munched on it and said, \"I like it.\" Mission accomplished.VosgesBacon + Chocolate?!As the hours breezed by, walking our way uptown through the crowded Union Square Greenmarket and other shops, we ended up on the long lines of Shake Shack just because I'm craving for ice cream or its sibling or cousin, since they serve frozen custard there. Even though we waited on Line B and it's just five people waiting in front of us, somehow it took us at least twenty minutes to get to order.Stacey and I ended up splitting a single hazelnut custard since I don't really want to eat the normal flavors of chocolate or vanilla and neither of us want to eat a huge serving.CustardCreamy...The hazelnut custard was buttery, nutty, and so creamy. I realized that it was a bit too sweet for me as I kept eating my share. Nevertheless, my frozen dairy craving was satiated. Then we both waddled (more like I did, while she strolled) our way to the subway station and go home. Fun times. I wish we could do this more often except with our hectic schedules, most likely we'll be seeing each other around the major food holidays (e.g. Thanksgiving and Christmas).Addresses: Lombardi's 32 Spring Street New York, NY 10012Vosges Haut Chocolat 132 Spring St New York, NY 10012Shake Shack Madison Ave & E 23rd St New York, NY 10010

Cindy: Everything was tasty...just some things were tastier than others. But nevertheless, it's all good.Kathy: Good lord, sometimes I think we have a similar (food) brain but have different times of a certain craving to be satiated. I dunno what the heck I'm talking about. It's weird yet cool that we think and eat alike! :)It's less than 12 hours 'til the PORK FEST!! Weeee...! :D

I can't believe anyone could think of a bacon + chocolate combo.  What's that taste like?and I really miss Shake Shack right now.

Fen: It's sweet, since it's milk chocolate with pockets of saltiness from the bits of bacon. It's intriguing, delicious, albeit expensive (for $7 a bar).Go to Shake Shack before winter really kick in! It'll really suck eating outdoors if you're sitting out in the cold.

Ohh, Lombardi's! That brings back good memories from a voyage down to NYC from Montreal. Thanks for sharing.

My god, that's expensive bar of bacon and chocolate.  Maybe i'll just make some bacon and at home and pour on the chocolate syrup :)

For strange reasons, I wanted to try Café Gray's food since well, it's very close to campus in Time Warner Center, and people have talked about Chef Gray Kunz's greatness back in the days of Lespinasse (click here for the review of Lespinasse on the NY Times by Ruth Reichl back in 1998, for the inquiring mind). Being the curious person that I am of Mr. Kunz's food and the recent Times article mentioned that they are serving lunch again, I managed to splurge here.As I arrived to Café Gray, a woman maître d' was waiting at the entrance, welcoming me and walked down the long corridor leading to the head maître d' to check on my reservation and table. As we proceeded, this café is actually broken down into three separate rooms: a bar (which was the first room you pass by), the main dining area where the open kitchen is located and there's another room on the right where it's not opened yet since there aren't that many diners at this time, since it was lunch at 12:30.The view of the open kitchenSilhouettes of female diner and chefsDining area on my rightThe dining room/open kitchen on my leftAs I've been seated toward at the middle of the room, a friendly server greeted me saying, \"Welcome to Café Gray. If you would like a drink, you may look at our wine list.\" Which actually looks like a wine and Champagne textbook with a short list of their seasonal cocktail drinks. I was tempted to get a drink but since I have class in less than an hour...not a good idea. I just told them that tap water's fine. As he departed, I glanced at how they set the table (I know it's strange, but I do pay attention to the details), and I notice that branding is prominent here, from the butter knife and napkin ring, down to the base of the wine glass. How odd. Another thing to note is that even though this restaurant has large windows spanning the views of Central Park, it's not for the diner. The chefs have that grand spectacle especially with the dark, murky skies that occurred that day.Then I perused the lunch menu and hope that there would be something that would appeal to me since I was hungry.Table settingAn example of brandingLe menuAfter deciding what I wanted to eat, an amiable, gregarious waiter arrived at my table asking me warmly, \"How are you today?\" and so forth. We had our brief conversation and went down to business of food. I inquired about their Mulligatawny soup but I wasn't feeling curry since I was still recovering from my cold (I can't taste complexity to a great extent whenever I'm sick), hence I ended up choosing the summer corn ravioli. The entrée was the mini foie gras meatloaf. As for dessert, I've asked his suggestion for what was really delicious since all do sound delicious on the menu. We ended up agreeing that a caramelized key lime pie would be a good idea since the foie gras is texturally heavy on the stomach, and the key lime is a good contrast.After he left, a different server graced me with a loaf of pre-cut fennel seed bread with butter. I asked him to repeat the actual name of this bread but his accent skewed the pronunciation. What really surprised me was that the bread was served warm! For all the restaurants I've been to so far, this was the first encounter of freshly baked bread; the heady, yeasty aroma that filled the air. How enticing. When I tear off the end piece and schmeared a thin layer of butter, I took a bite. This bread was quite extraordinary. The crust was quite thick, crunchy, crisp, and the bread innards were pillowy soft, with a scattering of fennel seeds. The anise flavor from these seeds was quite muted when it's something that would be expecting to be quite prominent. I like this bread a lot. When it comes to the butter, it was very rich and much sweeter than any butter I ever tasted so far. Wow. This elevated my bread basket experience and now I'm hoping the food would be as great as their bread.Fennel seed bread and buttaSlice of fennel breadIt took almost no time for my appetizer to come out. The summer corn ravioli looks pretty with the blade of lemon grass shooting upwards from the large white bowl. What disappointed me initially was that there's just two ravioli. But I'll let it slide for the moment since it might satiate me in terms of flavor. Eating one of those round, plump, fluted-edged pasta, it was quite intriguing. The al dente ravioli was stuffed with a savory-sweet corn purée. Quite good. The interesting elements along with it was the corn kernels, some kind of crunchy meat product that I am assuming fried bacon or something since it was a bit smoky in flavor. Small in portion yet very flavorful.Summer Corn RavioliClose upThen came my foie gras meatloaf. The first thing come to mind when I read this off the menu, it must be one ridiculously decadent meatloaf one would ever eat. And it's quite true. This meatloaf was mostly composed of ground pork and uniformly diced cubes of carrots, potatoes, and lentils, topped off with ketjap manis. Initially when I ate the parsely-lentil salad, I didn't think the lentils were lentils since it tasted quite tart and vinegary like capers. Another diner behind me read my thoughts somehow and asked the waiter about it and he did say that they were lentils. Ha, how foodies think alike.The meatloaf itself was very luxurious to say the least. The meatloaf was silky, smooth, with the chopped vegetables mentioned earlier, and it's stuffed with a small slab of foie gras, as well as topped with a sautéed one, as you'll see in the photos. The ketjap manis used on the coating on top of the meatloaf tasted like an extra tart ketchup with a touch of sweetness. It's very unexpected and innovative to turn something so simple and humble like meatloaf and make it haute cuisine.Mini foie gras meatloafClose upWhen it's dessert time, another server asked me if I wanted anything to drink with my dessert. I opted for a cup of coffee since I want some caffeine before classes start and as well as getting something bitter to contrast the sweetness of my pie.Coffee on a silver trayAs you can see, it's served on a silver tray with the usual accouterments of light cream, a variety of sugars, but with a small glass of water. This is a very similar style to what I had at Café Sabarsky. I'm pointing that out just because many restaurants don't serve it like this in a sophisticated way. However, their coffee isn't up to snuff to Joe's or even as potent as Sabarsky. Did I mention that it also cost me $5? I found that out once I paid my check. It's not worth it.Anyway, the caramelized key lime pie came in shortly and once again, they present the food in large, shallow bowls with small portioned food. (Why are they doing that?) When I took my first bite, the creamy, tangy, tart custard-like filling hits my tongue first then the chocolate cookie base kicked in later. Quite good but it's something I can make myself at home. I think this particular dessert was uninspiring for what I'm paying for. But at least it wasn't horrible.Caramelized Key Lime PieClose upInnardsAfter I finished my coffee and dessert, I have to haul my butt to class and asked for the check. In case you haven't really looked at the photo menu, the prix fixe lunch costs $38 for two courses and $12 for any additional course. So, you know how much it cost me at the end.My CheckFor what I've eaten and paid that day, I would rather go across the street and re-live the Jean Georges experience. But that's just my opinion.Address: Café Gray Time Warner Center 10 Columbus Circle, 3rd Floor New York, NY 10019

Awesome photos and writeup. One quick note: You mentioned that the prix-fixe was 28 dollars, yet the menu photo shows 38. Just wanted to point that out :-).

whoa $38 for lunch! The pictures and descriptions are ravishing. Frankly, it ain't my kind of food, but looking at the piccies make me want it. It's funny I've passed by Time Warner Center at least twice, and being within 1/2 a mile of it during my stays in manhatten, but never was clued in to the foodie heaven within. Next time I go I'll be sure to check it out.

Hey I just thought that i should point out that you made another error... The ravioli dish isnt garnished with lemongrass- which would be inedible raw as a garnish. The garnish is a \"popcorn shoot\", a young sprout of a particular variety of corn. That ,akes more sense, since it is a corn dish after all. Did you not notice when you ate it that the flavor or scent of lemongrass was absent? Well, anyway there is no doubt that it is a popcorn shoot. Just thought you should know!

Note: I'm going to write about Café Gray on a separate post. I know probably a few of you might have seen the photos but I'm not going to talk about them today...but sometime very soon.On Monday, I went was around Union Square during my lunch break since I have about an hour and ten minutes after commuting down there via the subway. Since I'm tired of eating at City Bakery and I don't want to eat sweets that day, surprisingly (probably due to the fact that I was semi-sick?), I went to Maoz Vegetarian.MaozThe line and dizzying interiorStepping into this narrow, cramped, bright green, psychedelic patterned take-out joint, it's a bit hectic. Given that it is lunch hour, students from NYU and local workers around the area are pouring out to grab some food but fortunately, the wait isn't so bad. Once I got my order, Meal Deal #1, which consisted of their Royal sandwich, fries, and a drink (which I chose a bottle of water), I plopped my stuff on one of the three chairs, and I went back to the salad bar and added a few of their veggies from the bar even though the sandwich itself looks pretty packed.SaladsCouscous & Roasted Cauliflower and BroccoliSaucesI didn't try their spicy sauces due to the fact that I was sick and I don't want to blow out my throat since I don't want to get in a worse condition that what I'm feeling at the moment. I ended up stuffing my sandwich with a chunk of marinated tomato, roasted cauliflower, and topped it off with some tzatziki sauce on top.OverstuffedInnardsThe sandwich looks like it's about to keel over from so much stuffage in it. The falafel balls itself tasted pretty good. It's crisp on the outside, well seasoned, and slightly moist on the inside. The whole wheat pita was pretty much the typical stuff one can get from a grocery store, nothing special. My qualms with this particular sandwich is the fact there's supposed to be eggplant in here but it's just one meager chunk and the composition of the sandwich is uneven, in other words, you get a ton of falafel balls on the top of the sandwich but once you eat toward the bottom of it, that's where most of the hummus and lettuce are located. I want a little bit of everything in one bite.I didn't bother taking a photo of the fries just because none of the photos I've taken looks appealing. It tasted fine but they were limp and soft.On Tuesday morning, I wanted some espresso so I went to Chelsea Market for Ninth Street Espresso's cappuccino.A feather (or leaf?) in my cupYeah, I love coffee and espresso, not just because of the caffeine but it's lovely aroma and flavor. Anyway, it's a very good cup with lovely crema and robust espresso flavor.There was a slightly better purpose of going down to Chelsea Market was to pick up a scone (from 202) and a mini baguette from Amy's Bread for tasting the fig jam that Robyn brought back from her Italian vacation.Once I got to Serious Eats after classes, I met Ed (in case you don't know by now, he's the head honcho of S.E.) once I got out of the elevator, I inquired about Robyn's whereabouts since she's not at her desk. He told me that she and Raphael went to the local Starbucks to try out the T-Mobile's Hotspot Wi-Fi on his iPhone. Since Alaina's the only person at the office, we exchanged greetings and she told me that Robyn brought a bunch of cookies from home, that I could help myself to. When I looked over at the table I saw the raided bags and a large box of cookies: the Stelle cookies that Robyn told me that she's bringing over when we written on each other's wall on Facebook the night before, and a box of cookies that her dad brought over from Taiwan. It's a cookie bonanza!COOKIES!If I was a really young child, I would actually just climb onto the table and eat recklessly until my stomach hurts. But I had my restraints just because I don't want to ruin my appetite for the fig jam. So, I tried a couple of cookies and they were all pretty tasty.BaiocchiPan di StelleThe Baiocchi cookies were pretty tasty. Small, buttery cookies sandwiched with a Nutella-like filling. Did I ever mention that I LOVE Nutella?! The filling tastes very close to it but texturally different. Nevertheless, I like this cookie. Apparently, it seems I can get my hands on them at Buon Italia in Chelsea Market...As for the Pan di Stelle, it's pretty good. Rich, deep chocolate with a hazelnut kick in the background, topped off with cute little stars. Robyn said they're like the potato chip equivalent of a cookie. You just have to eat more to get addicted to them. I just ate one and stopped at one cookie because of my earlier explanation.I hesitated eating more cookies just because I'm eating a ton of sugar and I haven't eaten lunch. But since that box of cookies that had open bags calling to me and say \"EAT ME!\" I just grabbed one of them. It's a small, round, dome shaped cookie that I found out that it's lemon flavored. It tastes good and sweet enough. And I found a cookie flavor list, more like a card that has the descriptions of what's filled in that box.Box o' cookiesList of cookies in ChineseUnfortunately, I am illiterate in Chinese and I speak broken Cantonese. I know, I'm a shame to the ABC (as in American Born Chinese) community, maybe. And I apologize this millions of times to my parents who've sent me to Chinese school when I was a kid and wasted their tuition money on that. The only thing that I understood from that card is the only thing that's written in English, espresso. Ha ha. To those of you who do read Chinese, props to you and you know what's in that box.After finishing noshing the cookies away and waited another five minutes, saying \"hi\" to Adam, the man behind Slice and A Hamburger Today blogs, Robyn finally made her presence and gave me the highly anticipated fig jam and the Amedei chocolate that I requested her to bring back from Italy.Fig jam!Chocolates!I ate tried my fig jam with the scone (that I mentioned much earlier on this post) and it's unlike any other fig jam I ever tasted. It's pure figs that's been cooked down to the figgy goo that it becomes after breaking down from the slow cooking processes of jam making with sugar. I probably shouldn't say \"goo\" since there's fibers of fig and seeds throughout that jam. It tastes like fig with complex flavors of wine and molasses. It's strange but it tastes like that just eating it straight out of the jar. What I really like about this jam is that it isn't cloyingly sweet and none of those artificial crap or corn syrup in it.As for the chocolates, I only tried the La Tavoletta Bar.La TavolettaUnwrappedSince Ed was curious about the chocolate since he has never heard of Amedei, Robyn and I told the short story of how and why I asked her to get them for me. Eventually we (all three of us) tasted a piece of this bar and liked it a lot; Robyn a little less just because she prefers sweeter, milk or semi-sweet chocolates.Then our conversation got extended a little with these chocolates, that I should do a chocolate taste test and compare these Amedei bars to some of the stuff in the mass market. No, I'm not going to compare a Hershey bar to an Amedei bar. That's an insult and the Hershey bar doesn't even have 70% cocoa content.I've already shopped for chocolate bars (gotten up to seven bars, not including these three) for this tasting but I haven't tried them yet just because I'm afraid that I would have the psychological effects of not wanting to touch another piece of chocolate once I'm done with them; just like the time with my \"best of croissants\" that I've done about a year ago. Eat a ton of croissants (chocolates coming very soon) and abstain them for almost half a year. I love chocolate too much that I don't want to hate or fear it.On Thursday, I went to Prune for lunch since I don't have classes since my professor canceled classes that day so basically it's a day of hunting for 70% chocolate bars and lunch. After perusing the menu and looking at my neighboring tables what they're eating, to see if anything look enticing, I just opted for their hamburger on an English muffin since I've read so many great things about it.Burger with friesInnardsAs you can see, this burger is sitting in a shallow pool of its own fat or maybe a combination of the beef and cheese fat, sandwiched between two toasted (almost burnt) English muffin, with a nice gooey layer of melted white cheddar cheese with a sprinkling of chopped parsley. After tasting the first bite, it's delicious! This huge puck sized beef patty was very well seasoned that it had a salty punch with the cheese and the herbs on top of it was a great symphony of flavors clashing on my tastebuds.The English muffin was a strange choice initially but it worked well because it's thin enough to make you focus on the meat more so than the bread or bun that is sandwiching them together yet it gives off that hint of sour flavor to contrast the rich flavors of the burger. It would be better if that muffin wasn't so burnt.Since their dessert menu is very limited (it's only flourless chocolate cake with a salted caramel sauce, lemon ice cream or a mixed berry tart), I walked over to Russ & Daughters for their halvah since Kathy have praised them of their halvah amongst the plethora of stuff she's mentioned that it's tasty there. Since I trust her tastebuds, I might as well give them a whirl since I never had halvah before. I ended up getting myself an almond covered halvah bar.Halvah barInnardsIt's a very tasty confection. The roasted almonds meets semi-sweet, 56% (no more than 60% from tasting it) chocolate enrobed halvah is so good. What does halvah taste like exactly? Well, to me it's a lightly nutty sweet that has the texture of layers of tuiles being bitten, it's texturally light yet satisfy my aching sweet tooth.Addresses: Maoz Vegetarian 38 Union Sq East New York, NY 10003Ninth Street Espresso in Chelsea Market 75 9th Avenue New York, NY 10011Prune 54 E 1st Street New York, NY 10003Russ & Daughters 179 E Houston St New York, NY 10002

Hee hee.  The decor at Maoz reminds me of the cell walls of plants.  It's like stepping into one of those cutout images from a junior high biology textbook.

Hey Tina!
Omg, did you like the roasted cauliflower and broccoli at Maoz - i think i liked that better than the falafel itself! ooooo, so excited that you had the halvah at Russ & Daughters...it like my favoritest thing in the world, hehe!
P.S.
Did you see that a cute guy at R&D I was talking about? ;)

Chubbypanda: Oh yeah, it does! I totally forgotten about plant biology since I used to take human anatomy courses back a few years ago...Kathy: D'oh! I forgot to mention how those veggies tasted from Maoz. Darn. Thanks for reminding me. I agree with you that their cauliflower rocks. Actually, I think their salad bar is better than their falafels.No. I didn't get to see that cute guy at R&D...  :(
The only people I got to see were basically a woman working at the confections counter and a sweet, older gentleman at the fish station. Oh well, I want to try their bagel and lox soon so I hope I get to see the guy. Ha ha. ;)I'll see you next week! Weee...! :D

Please let me know how the other Amedei chocolates tasted! I actually got from my chef at scholl a 1kg block of LaTavoletta and it was very good. Just so you know, I ALWAYS try new chocolates, yesterday I was at the chocolate fair as you can see on my blog. Now that was exciting. And have you visited Max Brenner already? ( I am sure you did...)

Dana: Thanks!In regards to the chocolate tasting, um, give me a couple of days so my palate and mind is prepared to try 10 different bars.Tea: Like I mentioned to Dana, please wait a couple of days. I tried the La Tavoletta but didn't really pay attention to the characteristics like I would if I were to analyze it.I've already visited Max Brenner in Union Square about last November, I think. It's like eating an expensive version of a Hershey bar: very disappointing and their crepes are horrible.

Saw your photo of the Pan di Stelle biscuits and then saw them again at an Italian deli here in London. Of course, I had to buy them - they're sooooo good! Thanks!

I only find it slightly weird when I encounter things like the Baiocchi & Pan di Stelle on foreign (for me) blogs... living in Italy, that's stuff we get at every single supermarket, as Barilla/Mulino Bianco are just the leader of the market and they are everywhere... ^_^ but yes, Pan di Stelle are definitely tasty! I might end up buying a pack next time I go grocery shopping....

Su-Lin: Yes! They're good...but I haven't gotten addicted to them (thankfully before I'll gain more poundage) since I want my fig. Hmm...probably I should scout for them in NYC?Paola: Well, that goes to show the world's getting smaller...thanks to Robyn!  Not entirely all her but the idea of international markets are opening up and travel and tourism, etc. are the venues of making the world \"smaller.\"
Okee...too much economic babble, but yes Pan di Stelle are awesome! :)

A Slightly Disappointing Lunch at Le Bernardin

The last time I've been to Le Bernardin was about three years ago and had their prix fixe menu. Arguably to say this, I'm not really a stranger to this place but years have passed, foodies still praise this restaurant and my inquiring mind wonders if this place is still good as it used to be.I went there the day before Thanksgiving with Ariel since he's willing to take the plunge with me on this expensive lunch. If you do look at their menu, $64 for three courses ain't cheap. Include tax and tip, it's at least $80. Yeah, for that price we have high expectations.InteriorUpon entering, I was greeted by two people, welcoming me to Le Bernardin and asked if I was dining with them. I have made reservations and I was told to wait until my table was ready. During the five minutes sitting at their waiting area, I've seen Chef Eric Ripert making a round in the dining room, stopping by a few tables and chat with them before he returned to the kitchen. It's actually the first time I've actually seen the actual chef gracing the dining room. I was a bit amused.After that was over, I was escorted over to my table in the back of the dining room. Hence, the interior photo that you see previously is looking toward the front. Eventually, Ariel made his presence and we were given menus and peruse what we wanted to eat. At the same time, one of the servers presented us with a bowl of salmon spread and a small plate of sliced bread. What Ariel said about this spread that it reminds him of something one would get from a deli, except the fish is a better grade; which I do agree.Amuse bouche?Reading over the menu, I've found out (after inquiring the waiter) they've taken out the fluke ceviche tasting! I was a bit disappointed since that particular appetizer was amazing when I had it back then. Three or four shot glasses filled with marinated fluke that have flavors ranging from simple to complex. Oh, how I missed that... Ariel and I eventually ordered after much more deliberation of what we should eat due to that missing dish.Shortly after ordering, another server came out with their bread tray and presented us with a choice of four different breads to choose from (which I don't remember all at the moment except for a rosemary, mini olive baguettes, and walnut rolls), we both chose an olive baguette and they've placed a silver tray of soft, room temperature butter. Strangely, Ariel had this weird notion of actually smearing his baguette with an entire pat of butter with a heap of salmon spread. Either he was ravenous or he's willing to shorten his life by a few years with that atherosclerosis-inducing sandwich.MMM...butterMy olive baguetteAriel's heart stopper of a sandwichEventually, our first course have arrived. Ariel's appetizer course was the Kanpachi, which is prepared as a tartare topped with wasabi tobiko, flavored with a ginger-coriander emulsion. Having a bite of his kanpachi, it's very delicious. The silky, smooth kanpachi melds with the slightly spicy kick of the wasabi, ginger, and coriander, with some texture from the fish roe. It would explain why he told me he's having another foodgasm.Kanpachi tartareMy appetizer, entitled \"Tuna,\" was sheets of thinly pounded tuna, covering an open-sandwich, if you will, of a thin slice of toasted baguette, and topped with a layer of foie gras. After trying Ariel's kanpachi, my appetizer is noticeably much heavier in terms of taste and textures due to the foie. The über thin, crisp baguette was the only crunchy substance of the dish, while the remaining dish was silky, smooth, fresh (the tuna) and earthy (the foie gras). I honestly liked Ariel's dish because it's more complex, innovative, and a tad more aggressively flavored compared to my tuna.My TunaInnardsAfter completing our first course, our mains arrived several minutes later. Mine managed to arrive first: Masala spiced crispy black bass sitting on top of a bed of Peking Duck-green papaya salad in a ginger-cardamom broth. Like Jean Georges, they present the dishes that contain soups or sauces by pouring it in front of the diner; as you will see in the following photo. Does service have to be this fussy? Arguably, since one is paying top dollar, it should be expected. But is it necessary? Probably not. Speaking of service, my water glass is empty for quite a while and no one actually filled it for the past five minutes prior to serving my fish. That's when they actually noticed it and filled it up right afterwards.Anyways, back to the food. My fish looked pretty delicious. A perfect sear and it's cooked perfectly but somehow when I ate the fish with the accouterments, I thought it was mildly...bland. The broth had nuances of ginger and cardamom. The salad that's underneath the black bass has minute punches of tart, sweet, and savory but it didn't harmonize well; it's more like disparate notes of a symphony. It sounded great, complex and intriguing when I'm reading it off the menu (that's the description I've gotten when I wrote it in the previous paragraph). It left me more to desire. It need something to make me fall in love with this dish which isn't happening. Ugh...it's like being sexually frustrated with a man (or woman, depending on your orientation).Pouring the brothBlack BassAriel's Skate arrived a minute after my dish was presented before us. The same fussy presentation went for his dish except he had an additional step of adding an extra green sauce on top of his pepper broth. A very similar argument goes for this dish as well. The fish is cooked perfectly but as a whole, it's quite disappointment. It's not screaming on my palate that this fish is the best thing on Earth. It's more like saying to me, \"It's good but there's no thrilling joy ride.\"Skate; as presentedSkate; steps 2 & 3Plating's completedThen we finally moved to the dessert course. After looking at their dessert menu, a few sound like it have some promises while the others sound a bit humdrum. Knowing that Chef Michael Laiskonis has a reputation (but not as great as Johnny Iuzzini of Jean Georges), nothing should be bad. I ended up choosing the Chocolate-Corn since that sounds the most intriguing. Ariel was stuck between a few desserts but ended up asking on a recommendation, which he got: the Chocolate Peanut.The Chocolate Peanut tasted fine. Think of having a sophisticated, less sweetened form of a Peanut Butter Cup. The textures were good: crisp crust on the tart; smooth, slightly peanut-y ganache, with the cold, creamy praline-citrus sorbet. It's very good but I don't love it.Chocolate PeanutMy Chocolate-Corn was quite excellent. The multiple textures of grittiness from the corn powder, ethereal crisp from the hazelnut tuile, and smooth creaminess from the chocolate ganache. All of those textures with the right amount of sweet corn flavor caresses the palate. Oh, this was divine.Chocolate CornMoments after our dessert arrived, our petit fours of sort was set on our table: a complexly folded napkin filled with baby financiers. The two flavors served are the regular and pistachio. Both tasted very good: nutty and buttery but it's mostly crunchy crust rather than a slight crust meets soft, moist, dense cake.\"Basket\" of baby financiersLooking in...It is tiny...After finishing our desserts and partially eating the financiers, Ariel requested to pack these dainty cakes so he could share it to his co-workers and we paid the check. We had to scurry since we managed to take a 2-hour lunch! Jeebus, what the heck took us so long?My overall impressions is like what I've stated on my title. I am a bit disappointed. The service is a bit lacking despite the fact that they do treat you with respect. The appetizers were good, while we were feeling that the entrées should have more pizazz, and the desserts were good but we both prefer what I had. For what we've spent, Ariel argued that we could have eaten almost one of everything in Degustation and be very satisfied in terms of hunger and the palate. Or have Jean Georges' lunch again, despite the fact that we left hungry but our palates were happily gratified. I do agree but it was nice to re-visit what was a good memory. I just tread with caution if I do come back here since my wallet feels significantly lighter.I should note the fact that my head's not feeling to well since I'm under medication. I got a cold from my younger brother over the Thanksgiving break, so it might explain the possible grammatical problems or slightly-off humor thrown around this post. Hopefully, you understand what I wrote or I'll revise and edit once my head is clearer and if you do indicate there's something off. I also hope I get well soon since I have that bo ssam dinner this weekend!Address: Le Bernardin 155 W 51st Street New York, NY 10019

well, the entree dishes do look pretty blah. Never having been in a restaurant of that caliber before, I'm in no position to judge. For that kind of price however, I do expect some fireworks. I guess the two entrees didn't look like they had a lot of creative effort put into it - which is presumably what one pays for at that kind of place.THe appetizers looked intriguing though!

Kathy: Oh I hope I'll be better soon just because I'm going to do jumping photos in the LES at 3 PM! It ain't fun doing that if my throat's so sore that I can barely speak.  -_-Call me when you're coming!Tea: I thought I was droning on like there's no tomorrow about Le Bernardin's food. At least you liked it! :)The chocolate corn dessert tasted fab! The financiers tasted very good as well, but I kind of wanted more cake than crust. It's too tiny to really call it an excellent financier.Dana: Well, from what my memory can recall about my first time there, my fish dish looked \"pretty blah.\" Unfortunately, they don't serve lunch or dinner a la carte. If they did, I would just go for appetizers and dessert. I would presume Ariel would be a happy camper if that happened.

I think that we all sometimes hype-up/expect something exciting from a situation to the point that when it comes round to it, things fail to live up to expecations (especially when they come at a high price!) Either that or we're getting increasingly picky, ha ha.Still, a nice entry to read and look at as per usual!

Rich: I guess so. Everyone has their own opinions since food is a very subjective subject.Next time, I'll research more into the expensive places I'm venturing since it's not easy for me to let go of my hard-earned money for something that was \"fine\" instead of \"OMG! Delicious bliss!\"Thanks for liking the entry! :)
At least I know being medicated doesn't really make me produce a bad or weird post.

After reading about Craft for years, I've always thought about eating here but hating the fact that they don't serve lunch, except at its sister branch Craftbar. That's until I read from the NY Times' blog, The Diner's Journal that Craft started to serve lunch again.Interior photosUpon entering this restaurant, I was a bit surprised how the its interiors look: pared down, rustic, exposed wooden beams and floors, even the incandescent light bulbs that hang down from the ceiling. It kind of suggest its reference to strong, simple, pure, and straight-forward flavors to the food.After perusing their menu for a couple of minutes, with a good amount of attention from two different waitresses (possibly because of my camera or the fact that it's just three other tables in their section?), I've finally ordered.The somewhat different or noticeable thing to note is the way they serve their bread. It's actually brought in a bread board (of two types: sourdough and whole grain) with your butter. Quite rustic yet unusual from my many experiences of eating out.Bread board and buttaAs for my appetizer, I ordered the sweetbreads with wilted arugula. I know, the previous post I've ordered sweetbreads that I'm actually clogging my arteries with extra fat that I'm really shortening my life span by a couple of years. Anyways, these sweetbreads were served in individual cast iron pan which kind of evokes the rusticity of something close to the farm or home. Quite endearing.The sweetbreads are seared that it has a salty, thin, crisp crust with the meaty innards. I can't really explain what sweetbreads taste like except it tastes like meat even though it's a gland. You just have to try it once and I assure you'll become addicted to it. The wilted arugula didn't really do much for this dish except maybe justify I'm eating something bad and have a little bit of greens, despite the fact it's coated in the lovely fat from the sweetbreads.The other accouterments that accompanied the sweetbreads are quince cake and a quince puree, which was a good contrast to sort of cut through the fattiness of the sweetbreads from the quince's tartness yet accompany it by it's sweetness and soft texture.Sweetbreads!Quince cake and innardsAs I was eating my sweetbreads, an older woman who sat at the adjacent table offered me her bottle of sparkling water since she's eating by herself, that she told me that she can't finish it by herself and willing to share it with me. Initially it struck me as odd since that never happened to me before but I didn't mind having some free bubbly water that would've cost me at around $5 if I bought the whole thing (she covered the cost, which I thanked her for doing so).Bubbles!After finishing my appetizer and sipping the carbonated water, I observed the dining room a bit as more diners arrived. About half of the diners were here on a business lunch, while the remainder are people who are eating with friends. It's more of a relaxed, refined yet rustic restaurant. There's no haughtiness. No pretense. It's just you, the food, and good service.Then the remainder of my food arrived, the side dish of roasted brussels sprouts and my half portion of pumpkin ravioli.The brussels sprouts was recommended by my waitress when I inquired what is the recommended vegetable, since I feel like I should eat some roughage from the generally bad food I'm eating, she said the brussels sprouts are the best. And it's served with bacon. After eating one of these babies, they were delicious. It's slightly crisp from the lovely caramelization and tossed with the rendered bacon fat and crisp bits, how can this dish go wrong? I've ate every last morsel on that plate.Roasted Brussels SproutsClose upThe explanation of me having only a half portion of the pumpkin ravioli was because I wasn't exactly starving when I came here. Heeding that warning to my waitress, she actually told me to go for the half portion since the raviolis are quite heavy, and take it from there if I'm still hungry. Would these three large, round dough filled with pumpkin puree sit before me should make feel full? I was skeptical at first but after eating them, it does actually does the job.The ravioli shell were cooked to al dente, stuffed with savory-sweet pumpkin puree that gushes out when it's cut in half, flavored with hints of rosemary. The hen of the wood mushrooms was very mild in flavor and it gives it some additional dimension of chewy texture. What makes this dish more appealing was the sweet brown butter sauce with the crunchy, toasted pumpkin seeds that topped it off, it melds everything together. If you had a little bit of everything in one bite, it's quite divine and very seasonal.Pumpkin Ravioli & Hen of the Woods MushroomsGOOSH!This was quite a wonderful lunch. I would come back again if I had the time and if I had the expenses to splurge on to try out the rest of the menu.Address: Craft 43 E 19th Street New York, NY 10003

nonono, you are loved! And the pumpkin raviolisI think I'm in love with those pumpkin raviolis; they look perfect for a cold day without being overly gooey or brick like. And that quince cake with the sweet breads...... it looks like, a tiny baklava!comparing yours and bruni's post on craft (which I coincidentally enough read literally hours before you posted) I think pictures must be an integral part of food reviews, particularly restaurant reviews. It's impossible for words alone to do justice to a delicatedly crafted dish. It's like trying to make someone get the feel of a painting without ever showing them the painting in question.

I'm like a peasant and he's the king or god of food critics. I'm truly humbled. Thank you for the compliment! :)Danny: Aww...you will. Someday. I think? If your boss is willing to let you out for an hour, the restaurant will speed up if you request or indicate you're in a hurry.

Ever since the party, Kathy have been urging me that I MUST go to Pinisi. She mentions it frequently on her blog and as much as I love that girl, I had the odd feeling that she went through hypnosis to actually to be that enamored with a bakery. I mean, I love bakeries but I don't really have a favorite. The main reason why I go to Bouchon Bakery (and write a TON about it) is because it's tasty; the food's pretty; and it's the biggest reason of all: it's the closest thing to my campus besides Whole Foods. Yeah, I'm lazy...Anyways, I finally went to Pinisi and find out what the heck she's raving about.Pinisi!After stepping in this tiny bakery, I was greeted with pretty cakes and desserts.Ok, enough with that. After taking those photos, I wanted to eat something. As I perused the pastry case, I became indecisive. A lot of their stuff just looks too good to pass up. Eventually, I settled for a slice of chocolate-pumpkin cheesecake.Cheesecake!InnardsWhenever I have or make cheesecake, it tends to be the typical NY cheesecake, as in a decadent, dense, heavy, creamy dairy based dessert. When it comes to Pinisi's it's surprisingly light. It's whipped enough that it's almost mousse-like in texture with enough pumpkin flavor and it's not dominated with too many spices. Very delicious. But after finishing and walk out 5 minutes later, I felt like I ate a brick. I guess that always happens whenever I eat cheesecake.Since I was walking up on First Avenue, I nearly passed by Momofuku Noodle Bar. I remember reading and saw a few photos of about their newly renovated space and their dessert, the soft serve ice cream that has brownie bits in the bottom of the cone. Since I was in the neighborhood and don't go here that often, I thought to myself, \"Let's eat here!\" Despite the fact I felt kind of full from that cheesecake.InteriorThe soft serve machine...The menuAfter looking at the menu, I know the general thoughts that their noodles aren't exactly awesome since there's been a lot of arguments in Chowhound about that topic. So, I stuck with the small plates and I was associating the portion sizes would be something similar to what I had in Momofuku Ssam. But that was a bad assumption...I ended up ordering the roasted brussels sprouts, fried sweetbreads, spicy tripe, along with every intention to eat that soft serve. Add those items with that big slice of pumpkin cheesecake I had half an hour ago, it's a lot of freakin' food.Roasted Brussels SproutsClose up of the brussels sproutsSomehow the veggies at Momofuku Ssam or Noodle Bar are amazing. It must be the pork or magical food powder that makes their roughage really yummy... Anyways, the sprouts were roasted to perfection, slightly crisp on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside. The kimchi that's sitting under the them gave the brussels sprouts a nice sweet, slightly tart, and spicy kick. What's also good about it is the addition of bacon. Bacon makes everything taste better, no? It's also quite a generous portion I thought it would be.Spicy Honeycomb Tripe & BaconThe tripe was not what I thought it would be since it turned out to be a soup/stew-ish kind of dish. The murky, dark red hue to the soup was a warning to my brain and tastebuds that this should a scorcher. And it was one spicy dish. The soup base tasted like it's tomato based with the addition of hot chili peppers, finely diced carrots, scallions, and onions (as you see on the earlier photo), and small chunks of silky, chewy honeycomb tripe. It's initially sweet but then the burn slowly builds up in the back of my throat as I kept eating it...'til I started to cough. Oy. After eating a small portion of it, I just kept it aside and told the server to wrap it up. It's very tasty but I want to save my humiliation of having my throat burned at home.Meet the Honeycomb TripeSoon after, my sweetbreads arrived.Sweetbreads!Once again, the portion size surprised me. It's basically a soup bowl's (a little bigger than that) size filled with fried veal sweetbreads. At this point, my stomach's already telling me, \"I'm full.\" But I'm ignoring it and ate these lovely fried nuggets of veal thymus glands. These are appealing to eat since they kind of like eating popcorn chicken; it's quite addictive until you've reached to the bottom of the bowl. They're fried until its crisp on the outside and the inside still have the juicy innards. Mmmm...I love sweetbreads.The dipping sauce that accompanies the sweetbreads is actually sweet and slightly spicy. It really goes well with the salty, meaty sweetbreads. The sauce is very tasty that I would imagine it being mixed in with some rice or something.Dipping sauceSome dipping action...InnardsThe pickles on the side are actually pickled for short amount of time since it tastes like cucumbers with a hint of salty-sour flavor. It's a refreshing contrast to the sweetbreads.After eating all of those dishes (except for the tripe), my stomach's waving the white flag and shooting electrical impulses to my brain screaming, \"I'M REALLY FULL!!\" My server came back to my table, clearing it up, asked me, \"Do you want your soft serve yet?\" I told her, \"Uh, not yet. I'm really full.\" Thankfully, she understood and she told me to take my time and let me linger around for a bit for digesting all the food I ate. Within time, I got my soft serve.ICE CREAM!Close up; partially lickedOriginally, I thought the ice cream flavors would be sweet Cream and espresso with brownie crumbles since I've read that a few weeks prior to my visit. But it's actually pumpkin and cream cheese with carrot cake crumbles. I kind of wanted chocolate but since it is fall and I do like pumpkin, I don't mind having it.The pumpkin side had enough pumpkin flavor with nutmeg and a touch of cinnamon. The cream cheese was tart and mild. Neither flavors are too sweet and the flavors compliment each other well. As I've eaten about a little more than halfway, the crumbles are actually there.CrumblesClose upI thought the crumbles would be something like cookie bits kind of crunchy. I don't know what made me had that presumption but it's more like crunchy on the top layer, if you will, then as I progressed on eating my way down, it became more softer and cake-like. Taste-wise, it does taste like carrot cake: spiced with cinnamon, nutmeg, and allspice. Even just looking at my macro shot of the crumbs, it does have tiny specks of carrot, too. Go figure. This was a good dessert but the price tag of $4 left me my wallet feeling a bit sore.This was a good meal nevertheless. Just next time I need to bring at least another person to share my food.Speaking of eating tons of food, Happy Thanksgiving everyone!Addresses: Pinisi 128 E 4th Street New York, NY 10003Momofuku Noodle Bar 171 1st Avenue New York, NY 10003

OMG, hahah, I didn't realize that you went to Momofuku right after Pinisi!!! That is a hell ton of delicious food you had in such a short time span! I've never tried the chocolate pumpkin cheesecake at Pinisi! There's just so many things there, and he changes the selection all the time...must go back, hehehe. But it was really your shot of the sweetbreads that started my stomach growling, that looks too fantastic for words. As if pan fried sweetbreads weren't rich/decadent enough, they go and fry 'em?! Oh lordy, MUST HAVE! :)Enjoy your thanksgiving & eat plenty! =)

oh that tripe looks perfect for a cold wintry day in the city! As for brussel sprouts, I've always hated them until I had it at a korean buffet where these mini-cabbages were roasted or grilled or whatevered to greasy perfection. Now I am a convert.hmm, from the looks of things I just might skip the momo ssam bar and goto the momofuku noodle bar instead, as it's mostly theese tapas like dishes you described here that attracted me so much to the ssam bar. And the portion at the noodle bar does look bigger =D

Kathy: It really does seem Pinisi do a daily rotation of baked goods. I just found out that he only does Red Velvet cupcakes when I've asked for it, which they've ran out! :(Oh, I love sweetbreads. Frying it just makes it tastier and more worse for my health.Dana: The tripe is a great winter dish! It's hearty, spicy, and most importantly, delicious!In regards to the Ssam Bar vs. Noodle Bar, the Ssam Bar has more small dishes available during the night; the daytime it has a limited selection along with their ssam (which are wraps).The Noodle Bar has more selections during the day, as for the soft serve is only at this place. But both places are very good, just some have their strengths and specialties of their own.Tea: It was intense fooding that day! I don't know if I would do it again but I don't exactly regret it either.

After riding out the joy of hanging out with a bunch of good friends at my party, life's never been the same. I have to go back to the reality of school: papers needed to be done and the coming of finals within a month from now, my happiness has decimated to nothing.Instead of sounding mopey, I've gotten a few good edible presents! I've received two Donna Toscana bars from Kathy and a box of Mary's Chocolate and Amano bar from Robyn. (Thank you!! In case I haven't told to either of you.) It's chocolate related since they know I love chocolate and conveniently, they've attended the Chocolate Show was on prior to my party.Donna Toscana BarsBox of Mary's Chocolate and Amano barThe Toscana bars were good. Personally, I prefer the bittersweet almond brittle over the bittersweet pistachio brittle since the pistachio bar's chocolate had a woodsy flavor that I don't really like. It sort of reminded me of the Green & Black's bar that I tasted which I don't like at all, but in the Toscana bar the flavor was a bit more controlled. Somehow, I polished off those two bars within 2 days...As for Mary's Chocolate, they were my next victims...Plated chocsThey're almost too pretty to eat...almost. All but one survived. Why did one survive? Well, I kind of felt bad that Robyn have forgotten to get a few chocolate samples for Ariel from the Chocolate Show, that I'm willing to save him one aesthetically pleasing, delicious bonbon for him. Yeah, I'm too nice to him...Back to the chocolates, as for the ones I've consumed they were all very delicious despite the fact that I didn't know what the flavors were since there weren't any chocolate tasting guide packaged with this box. That's until I came across my Flickr friend Sera's Chocolate Show photo. Thankfully, she helped me in regards to what I ate.Mary's truffles and its innardsThe remaining chocs...Just to cut to the chase of what I've eaten, just click on the truffles and its innards photo above and you'll know what they are since I don't want to kill you with me rambling on about the chocolates. Simply stated, they're awesome. Just get some if Mary's is in your neighborhood or when you get the chance to go to the Chocolate Show. You won't regret it. It's unlike any American or European chocolate you've ever tasted.As for real food (sort of), I was craving for something salty and pastry-like for breakfast. The only thing that could equate the aforementioned is City Bakery's addictive pretzel croissant.My BreakfastClose up of the croissantThis salty, crisp, buttery yet light pastry was delightful. It satiated my craving and the coffee was pretty good to boot. The coffee was balanced between acidic and bold with a touch of berry, and it's not diluted. It's a good breakfast, albeit not a healthy one either.A few days later, I had a strange urge to eat pies and tarts. Most likely the reason is the coming of Thanksgiving, which in my house it's a food fest that lasts for two to three days. Oh, help me from the food/stomach explosion... Going back to the pie/tart craving, I first went to Bouchon Bakery (I know, again!) for their new seasonal tart of sorts, the fig and hazelnut crème brûlée tart. In case you haven't known this, I love figs and if it's on a dessert, I'll try it and have expectations to be swooned or at least like it.The tart; in different anglesWedge of fig tartWhat I love about Bouchon's food is that they're so darn...photogenic. What's even better that it's very good (and I'm talking about the tart). The crisp, buttery pâte sucrée, encrusted with chopped, toasted hazelnuts along the edges contrasted the firm vanilla custard (which I prefer to have an extra oomph of vanilla) and sweet, dense fig paste. The burnt sugar topping was the least favorable part since it's done ahead of time and sitting in the refrigerated pastry case, it lacks the brittle, glass-like characteristic hence it's a bit gooey.Then after classes (on the same day of the above tart), I had a pie craving. The only place where I've remembered that has good pie would be the Little Pie Company so I hop on the nearest subway down to the Meatpacking District.Little Pie CompanyNon-food photos inside Little Pie Co.Cupcakes!Small Carrot Cake & Meringue PieI was somewhat surprised that the interior of this place was part bakery and part diner, or at least it reminds me of one. I sat on one of their stools and perused their menu. I remember from reading an article from somewhere years ago that Little Pie's signature or best pie was their Sour Cream Apple Walnut pie, since it's considered the best, why not go for it? Along with a cup of coffee and some ice cream on the side. Yep, another round of sinful eating...Coffee + Pie = Yum!...Close up of the pie a la modeWhoever written the article and a ton of other sources I ever read about this place, they have not steered me wrong. This pie was very good. The crust was buttery but not exactly flaky. The ratio of filling to crust was quite good. The streusel topping made of brown sugar, cinnamon, butter, and walnuts were crisp and complimented the thinly sliced, cinnamon-y, Granny Smith apples. The vanilla ice cream was fine, not the best I've ever tasted. It has a good amount of vanilla flavor but it's not creamy enough for me. But overall, I'm quite content with this pie.The coffee was fine as well. It's a bit too light for my preference but it does work well with the pie; it doesn't dominate or dissipate when drunken with the dessert.That's pretty much the bulk of what I've eaten the past week and a half. Come to think of it, the things I've written for you people are basically more sweets and desserts! Gah, I need to eat more \"normal\" food but the normal food I eat are banal sandwiches and salads that are from Whole Foods near my campus. Well, at least there will be some better things to read in the near future that doesn't necessarily pertains to sweets alone.Addresses: City Bakery 3 W 18th Street New York, NY 10011Addresses: Bouchon Bakery 10 Columbus Circle, 3rd Floor New York, NY 10019Little Pie Company 407 W 14th Street New York, NY 10014

everything you've had at bouchon is seriously very photogenic...but i think a lot of that has to do with the fact that you're such a good photographer!! :)
sour cream apple walnut pies...momofuku soft serve...city bakery baked goods *emitting food thoughts/waves* - i feel as if we eat our way though each other's minds, hehe! :)
p.s.
hope school isn't killing you...you're almost done!!! =)

i couldn't agree more with the first comment! I've seen plenty of murky photos that I've come to appreciate good photography, particularly that of food, which like it or not, while delicious, is for the most part not very photogenic 99% of the time.hey, what's wrong with eating sweets ALL the time? I do it way too much and i would probably scare myself if I documented it all.

Kathy: Haha...oh, thanks for thinking I'm a good photographer. I'm good but not as good as others that I've seen...We telepathically think about food, unconsciously! Jeebus, we're odd.I'm surviving school. Thankfully, it's going to be over very soon. I need a break.Dana: Thanks for the compliment. :)What's wrong?!  I'm eating too much sugar that I'm giving myself diabetes!

Oh wow, lots of sweets! mmmmm
I found it hilarious when you wrote \"Somehow, I polished off those two bars within 2 days…\" HAHAHAHA, that was the best.
Since I a am a big chocolate taster myself, I will try not to skip those  ;)
Is little pie company really that good? I came across it once, but nothing looked that appealing to me...
p.s I LOVE Whole Foods stores! :))

Tea: Little Pie Company was good but not extraordinary. I haven't eaten that many pies to tell you what's really \"The Best\" in the city. But Ed Levine's written a great article about pies in the city.

Note: This event was taken place last Saturday...I know it's late but I was actually waiting for a few of Robyn's photos (which I will credit and link to when it occurs) since I had relatively little photos of the party-goers since I was busy playing hostess of sorts toward the second leg of the party.Edit (11/17/07) : I NO longer need people for my other upcoming party...but thanks for a few of you who have responded!I threw myself a birthday party...a day later. Since I have to take care of family and school stuff that I can't go out and party for a good portion of the day on the day of my actual birthday. Anyways, I've invited 8 friends (Adam, Ariel, Doug, Jessica, Julie, Kathy, Kim, and Robyn) for a large get-together and do what I (or we) do best, eating! We all met at the Highline since it's been suggested by a few Chowhounders that their food is pretty good and it can accommodate large groups.Since I was the first to arrive, I sat down in one of the large communal style tables toward the back of the restaurant on the ground floor. The decor isn't what I was expecting after viewing their website. But at least it's not terribly distracting and there's no music blaring in this place that I won't be suffering from laryngitis at the end of the lunch.Anyways, as my guests slowly arrive, we greeted each other and eventually talk about food since it's about 1:30 PM, and we're starving.The lunch menuWe ended up ordering pairs (or three) of the same things. (Methinks we all think alike or have similar tastes.) For appetizers, Doug had the salad; Ariel, Robyn, and Julie ordered the fritters; Jessica and Adam had the dumplings; Kim wanted the veggie rolls, while Kathy and I had the pad thai spring rolls.When the appetizers came out, they all look so photogenic. I haven't tried Doug's salad since it's basically a bunch of greens with a basil-balsamic dressing and a sprinkling of what looks like pignoli nuts around the various lettuce leaves.Doug's GreensI haven't tasted Jessica's and Adam's dumplings because they were at the other end of the table...it's difficult to reach over a couple of people's plates to reach for a bit, you know? But judging from the photo, it looks good.Jessica's & Adam's Dumplings; taken by RobynI haven't tasted Kim's appetizer since it was tiny and hard to split. But I tasted the hoisin-tamarind dipping sauce that accompanied her veggie rolls, which was sweet and tart. Come to think of it, it vaguely reminds me of what I had at Bon Apetit's Supper Club a few weeks ago when I had Govind Armstrong's Tropical Rolls except the dipping sauce was sweet-spicy rather than sweet and tart.Veggie RollsFor something that I have tried, I tasted one of Ariel's fritters and it was quite good. The outer shell was crisp, the inside was a bit moist. The filling was composed of ground/finely chopped chicken meat and shrimp. The mint-tomato salsa that accompanied this appetizer was good but I don't really taste it; only toward the finishing note I only had that feeling of freshness that's coming from the mint. That sauce tastes predominantly of tomatoes, onions, and a slight kick from the peppers.FrittersThe spring rolls were pretty to look at and it was fried to perfection: light and crisp. It wasn't a dense grease-bomb that would make anyone feel disgusting. In terms of flavor, it's fine but nothing extraordinary.Pad Thai Spring RollsIn terms of drinks, Ariel ordered the Longboat cocktail, while Doug ordered a bottle of beer. What Ariel told me about this drink was that it was quite delicious. It's lemonade based with a hint of ginger (as you can tell there's ginger in it as there's a huge slice as an embellishment for this drink).The LongboatDoug's Beer; taken by RobynAs we ate, table's been cleared, and conversed our own conversations, our second course came out. The popular items for the table was salmon either encrusted with sesame seeds or crushed, toasted peanuts; or the \"black rice towel\" dish (I will explain this dish in a bit). I haven't tasted either salmon dishes but again, looks mighty delicious.Black & White SalmonPeanut Crusted SalmonThe Black Rice Towel dish (ordered by Kathy, Robyn, and Kim (she has the beef)) is basically ho fun that is stir-fried with your choice of meat or tofu with dark soy sauce and what looks like gai-lan, which is Chinese broccoli. The silky, slightly greasy, chewy rice noodles matches the chewiness of the meat or tofu. Quite delicious.Black Rice Towel with TofuKim's Black Rice Towel with BeefJulie ordered the Talay spaghetti. I have no idea what this taste like since Julie's sitting on the other end of the table, so it escaped the possibility of her noodles entering my mouth. According to the menu, it's made with Thai chili, red bell pepper, and basil.Talay SpaghettiAriel is not really enamored with fish unless he's going to Le Bernardin (which he will very soon) or a particular fish dish sounds really intriguing. Anyways, he ordered the N.E. Steak. Don't ask me how the restaurant name some of their dishes but it's basically marinated, grilled steak that's been sliced and dressed with a spicy-tart sauce, with the addition of steamed string beans, broccoli and a dome of rice on the side. The steak was fine and the complexity of the sweet, tart, and savory components was good, but I'm not exactly blown by it.N.E. SteakI ordered the pineapple red curry duck. It's basically duck (a leg and a few pieces of its breast meat) spiced in a red curry sauce and mixed in with bamboo shoots, red bell peppers, and basil. Quite a kicker but I feel a bit deprived of meat since the leg meat refuses to release from its bone. And since I'm wearing a cream colored dress and sweater, I don't want to dare pick it up with my fingers...or my dry cleaner will love me at the end of the day.Pineapple Red Curry DuckHere's a few photos of the people who've joined me (that I managed to take photos in the restaurant)...Ariel...he's smiling!Doug and Kathy! Apologies for the out-of-focus photo.After we finished eating, we hanged out here for a bit discussing about random things like politics, movies, etc. Eventually, we asked for the check and paid. Overall, I was pleasantly surprised how inexpensive the meal was and how good the food tastes.In case you haven't noticed, I was swooned from the last time I went to How Sweet It Is. I told everyone that desserts on me since it's kinda my way of saying \"Thank you\" for everyone getting out of bed on a Saturday, and actually celebrate my existence on Earth for 22 years.After lots of discussion and contemplation amongst most of us for a good five to ten minutes, everyone have finally made their decisions of choosing one dessert. After blitzing the two women who were working at there at this hour (whom I haven't met before despite visiting there three times) with our orders, I've paid and we all migrated over to Kathy's place.We walked only over a few blocks to her place, which was convenient since we're running a bit late and it's getting quite cold. After walking six flights of stairs to get to Kathy's place, everyone managed to cram into one room and get acquainted with her place: the tiny kitchen, the cool food photos she placed along the wall off her room, and Robyn's fascination with the mugs I've brought over to Kathy's earlier this morning (which I nearly passed out from hauling them amongst a bunch of other things. Did I mention that there are no elevators?). Then I started to make espresso for the group, since I can't have dessert without coffee or water.Colorful mugs and milks...We all then sit in a large oval in the kitchen/seating area of Kathy's place and break out the desserts, the highlight of any good meal or get together. And most of us whipped out our cameras and started to take photos of the food and/or the people.We want sweets!; photo by RobynWe're taking photos; captured by RobynSo, here's what we've gotten. We ordered two goat cheesecakes topped with candied kumquats, two Opera cakes, two sheep's milk honey caramel panna cottas, a Guinness spice cake, a Devil's Food chocolate cupcake, and a Banana Foster's Cake.Dessert Tasting Plate #1Dessert tasting plate #2Despite the fact that we had almost two of everything, most of us just did a tasting of sorts that we take a bite or two of our desserts and passed them around for others to try. My odd joke about this was that we're \"indirectly kissing each other.\"Here are more people photos enjoying their desserts or just chatting...AdamJessicaKimWe're happy... taken by KimSince it's about 4:30, I have to leave the city and go home and have to abandon the hot chocolate project with everyone. Also, a couple of others have to get going too. We've exchanged hugs and said our goodbyes...leaving Robyn, Kathy, and Doug at the apartment.This was one of my best birthday parties I've had in a long while. And now I miss everyone terribly. Thanks to everyone who've attended my party! You're the best! And we have to hang out soon...Addresses: Highline 835 Washington Street New York, NY 10014How Sweet It Is 157 Allen Street New York, NY 10002I NEED PEOPLE!!I need two more people for an upcoming party on Saturday, December 1st. We're going for the BO SSAM at Momofuku Ssam! (In case you haven't read my post about my previous experience, here it is.) If you're in NYC by then and want to go, drop me a comment on this post or e-mail me (with your legit e-mail address), then you might eat with me and a bunch of other foodies and my friends. It'll be fun!

A Memorable Birthday Dinner at Degustation

***CONTENT
Last night I went to Degustation for dinner. You might be wondering why would I choose this place? Well, I've been meaning to eat here for a while ever since I've read Frank Bruni's review of this place, it seems very enjoyable in terms of atmosphere and food. Foodies at Chowhound likes this place a lot and the fact I love tapas. I ate this dinner with Ariel since he loves Catalonian food...or anything that tastes good and he's willing to splurge with me.Signage on the doorLooking through their window...We were the first ones to arrive, and a bit too early since the restaurant didn't open its doors when Ariel tried to pull it open. So, we just hang out in the chilly, autumn night catching up what's been happening in our lives. About a few minutes later, the maître d' opened the door and welcomed us inside.Interior (taken when we left the place but gives you the idea)The place is small, as Bruni and other foodies I've spoken to indicated. But somehow its smallness feels intimate with the dimly lit candles, casual, and having the kitchen open to the diners is a very different experience from the myriad of places I've eaten out. Since Ariel and I were the first to arrive, they let us choose any seat we want to take and ended up taking the center, getting a full view of the kitchen. Then we look at the menu.MenuAfter much lengthy discussion what to order and whether or not to go for the Chef's Tasting Menu. Eventually, we took our own route having six plates shared between the two of us and Ariel ordered a drink, the Black Velvet.The Black VelvetEven though I haven't tasted Ariel's drink, he said it was very smooth with a strong alcoholic kick at the end. If you had the Coming Up Roses before (at the Modern or elsewhere), it's a similar idea except not as sweet since it's made with beer instead of sweet liquors.As we wait and chat along while the kitchen's cooking our food, I noticed Chef Wesley Genovart prepping and cooking dishes along with his sous chefs in relative silence except for his conversations with his staff in Spanish. It's kind of intriguing to watch them fire up the grill and see our squid being cooked, or Mr. Genovart seasoning the dish all done in front of us, amongst the plethora of things they've done without me noticing.Exec. Chef Wesley Genovart cookingSquid's on the grillAnd soon enough, our first courses of sort are served.The Spanish \"tortilla\" are tiny, savory packets of deliciousness. The paper thin slices of potato filled with gooey quail egg yolk and shallot confit just bursting with intense caramelized sweetness with the hint of onion-y flavor from the shallot. This would be an awesome amuse bouche or it can be a savory bonbon.Spanish \"tortilla\"CroquetasUsually, I have issues with croquettes (same with Ariel), that they tend to be fried, dense potato balls of blandness. But there's none to be found here. These croquettes are \"what croquettes should taste like,\" as Ariel declared after eating them. They're extremely crisp on the outside, almost tempura-like with an ethereal crust. The inside is light, sweet, and salty potato mashed in with some sweet corn kernels. Also each croquette is sitting in a small puddle of red pepper aïoli to give it a spicy kick.Croqueta innardsMoving on to our second course, came out the stuffed squid and the seared scallops.The seared scallops were succulent, meaty, delicately sweet, and cooked to perfection. The dehydrated cherry tomatoes offsets the sweetness of the scallops with tartness and a hint of sweetness as a finish, while the sea beans (also known as samphire) gave it a mild salty bite. The shallow pool of mussel broth is a good medium to combine all the flavors into harmony, giving it a seafood.Seared ScallopsThe stuffed squid was the least stellar dish of the night. I have heard that it was a really delicious dish except somehow the components didn't take me away. The squid was cooked correctly. It's filled with with Kurobuta pork cheeks sitting on top on a bed lentils. The reason why it didn't make me swoon is because there aren't the multiple flavors playing with my tongue. It's basically two notes of flavors: salt (but not overly) with earthiness (of lentils and pork). There aren't any contrasting flavors that elevates this dish to its potential.Stuffed SquidThen finally, our last course.The warm mushroom salad was one of my and Ariel's dispute about foie gras, since we love it. Given the fact that we have our disparate views, Ariel asked the waiter for his opinion of whether to choose this warm mushroom salad or opt for the seared foie gras. The waiter replied that the warm mushroom salad is his favorite of the two, hence we ordered it. Was the waiter correct? Well, it was a bit curious to see a foamy sauce to top off an assortment of sliced mushrooms. The various fungi had slightly different flavor and textural characteristics that interplayed one another, that worked so well. The crispy, salty bite from the lamb bacon and sea salt and the foamy foie gras sauce made it very enjoyable. I don't mind having this mushroom salad everyday...if I could make it at home.Warm Mushroom SaladThe \"cheese steak\" is a gussied up, gourmetized version of the cheese steak that we all know of. It's stacked with tomatoes and roasted red pepper escalivada, raclette cheese emulsion, pain de mie and herb salad. Since Ariel had first dibs with this sandwich, I was deprived of the herb salad that topped off this tower. Living without the salad, it tastes pretty good. The juicy, tender beef with the silky, slightly nutty cheese sauce worked well together. Spicy bites of jalapeño that was actually mixed in that escalivada mixture. A crunchy bite of thinly sliced, toasted bread as the supposed support to the entire sandwich. If that herb salad was still existent, it would provide that missing zing for this sandwich to be sublime.The \"Cheese steak\"After finishing the last bits of our dishes, we asked for the check and hightailed over to Chelsea for the Goatstravaganza.The CheckThinking of the overall dinner, everything was paced well in between courses. Service was prompt and friendly. It wasn't particularly busy since it was a Thursday night and it we were there from 6 to 7 pm. Also the damage wasn't so bad and much more filling than Jean Georges' lunch that we had a few months ago.This was a wonderful birthday dinner for myself, as well as Ariel thoroughly enjoyed it as he wished that he could eat that meal every night.Note: I will not write about Goatstravaganza since we arrived there quite late and there wasn't much to take photos of.Address: Degustation 239 E 5th Street New York, NY 10003

It helps a lot to have a great dSLR camera, an IS (Image Stabilization) lens, and a macro lens (with a large aperture) for low light shots. Photoshop helps, too.

happy birthday Tina!those spanish tortillas...i mean, wow. I think you delicioufy everything ten times.i think i will have to visit there. I went to Tintol, a tapas bar in midtown, and I loved it. Just whets my appetite for more of these goodies.

Dana: Thanks for the b-day wish! :)
Haha! No, I did not exaggerate those wonderful Spanish tortillas. They are absolutely sublime but I wish it's either more of them or larger in portion size.Oh, I heard of Tintol but it's something about being close to Times Square scares me. Probably because of the hordes of tourists? But I'll probably go there someday.

I ate there back in September and it was one of my favorite meals. I plan on going back since the menu changes. We loved everything except the dessert and the squid.

Ya know, I should be paying attention of my intake of pastries these days, especially with the fact that my birthday's next Friday. Aging would mean the slowing of metabolism, cholesterol levels are bound to be high by now, especially with the blood sugar levels with the stuff I'm eating. I would eat healthier foods but I would feel deprived if I don't eat sweets or any \"bad\" foods. At least I'm working out...A few days ago, I went back to Amai Tea & Bake House since everyone from the previous post about them, were commenting about trying out their scones and cookies. It seems strange that I came back so soon, but I was in the neighborhood and I was STARVING. I don't know why, but I was.As you'll see on the photo below, I went insane for pastries. I ended up with a vanilla bean scone, an Early Grey and currant scone, a green tea matcha cookie, white tea and strawberry cookie, and an almond chai cookie. Yeah, that's a lot...along with a side of lavender butter for an extra fifty cents.The whole shebangBlob of Lavender butterSchmeared scones...with lavender butterThe Earl Grey and currant scone was pretty interesting. It's florally and light with a touch of spices and bergamot orange that is usually in this particular tea. The currants was a nice, slightly sweet, chewy touch to the scone. And the addition of lavender butter compliments the florally essence of the Earl Grey tea. The problem with the scone I had was that it's a bit dry.The vanilla bean scone is basically the typical scone. It's delicately sweet, crumbly, and it has a hint of vanilla flavor. It's nice with the lavender butter since the vanilla bean is the most versatile of the scones they have, but it didn't blow me away. Also the problem with this particular scone is that it's a tad under-baked in the center.At least their cookies fared a whole lot better than the scones...The three cookies...All their cookies are basically shortbread-based; they're all crumbly, buttery, lightly sweetened with different flavor variations. Of the three, the white tea and strawberry cookie was the most intriguing and tastiest. The white tea played a clean, delicate background flavor, not much of the grassiness that green tea normally would contribute, while the sweet strawberry flavor was bursting through a few seconds after the bite.The matcha green tea cookie was nice but I tasted more of a vanilla-buttery flavor more so than the green tea. And the almond chai tea was also good but nothing really stood out except it had a nice hit of chai flavor.I really do like Amai. The best thing I would go for after trying a whole bunch of sweets from the past two visits is the Roasted Sweet Potato puff pastry. I should correct myself about this particular pastry a bit from my previous post. Kelli told me that she was surprised that I said that I have tasted hints of spices, even though there weren't any added at all. It's just plain sweet potatoes from the Farmers' Market down a couple of blocks east, and roast them in the oven to its delicious sweetness. That's some sweet potato. Probably I should get some meself and make an awesome sweet potato pie for Thanksgiving...which isn't too far away.Then on Halloween, I went to Jacques Torres' Chocolate Haven in SoHo.Jacques TorresLately these days, I'm having a huge craving for hot chocolate and it's not even that cold. Nevertheless, I ended up going sugar happy again and got myself a caramel hot chocolate, a pumpkin chocolate chip cupcake, and a passion fruit macaron.More sugar...I tried the hot chocolate first since that's what I've been craving all day. It's nice and warm, thick, but a tad too sweet. They've used a bit too much caramel sauce and the fact that not all of that sauce was dissolved, that I'm chewing bits of caramel in between sips. It's pretty good but they need to reduce the amount of caramel.Then I went for the macaron. The last time I had it, it was pretty good: thin shell, moist innards, and it has a sweet and flavorful filling. But this was awful. It does have that thin, smooth shell but the innards are so dry. The filling is surprisingly a slightly insipid jam. This left me with a gaping hole of disappointment in my heart. My macarons hopes are getting dashed quicker than I expected.MacaronDepressing innardsThen I dived into the cupcake. It's very adorable and Halloween appropriate since usually one would think of pumpkins for this holiday.It's so cute!InnardsThe cupcake was light, very moist, just sweet, a good pumpkin flavor with a hint of nutmeg and cinnamon to compliment the pumpkin. The chocolate chips were more like chocolate chunks that sank to the bottom of the cupcake forming a semi-solid layer of chocolate which made it a tad hard cutting with a plastic knife. The cream cheese frosting was smooth, sweet and a touch of tartness to round out the cupcake, and it's topped off with a marzipan pumpkin. How sweet. Arguably, this cupcake was the salvation of my trip here.Later on the afternoon, I went to Chelsea Market because I was shopping for kitchenware for my upcoming party at Kathy's place. Since I was looking for good chocolate around the city that doesn't cost me an arm and a leg, I walked into Buon Italia to check out their chocolates. Even though I had no intention of getting anything more beyond chocolate or espresso beans, I saw this [points down]...A bag of Pan di Stelle cookiesHow I love thee...Remembering the cookie that Robyn loves so much from her recent vacation from Italy and eating one at Serious Eats, I bought myself a bag. I fell into the hole of addiction ever since I opened this bag of chocolate lovelies; eating them two out of three meals within three days. Robyn's right, it's like eating potato chips. You eat one, you just can't stop. Robyn, as much as I love you, I blame you for my obsession for these cookies! Pierre Herme macarons are one thing (since it's so elusive getting one here in the States, it's harmless) but this cookie is accessible, which is obviously a bad thing. Ugh...is there such a thing as Pan di Stelle Anonymous out there?Addresses: Amai Tea & Bake House 171 3rd Avenue New York, NY 10003Jacques Torres' Chocolate Haven 350 Hudson Street New York, NY 10014Buon Italia in Chelsea Market 75 9th Ave New York, NY 10011

Amanda: The cupcake was awesome! The cookies were tasty; just some better than others, in my opinion.Dana: Well, the green shortbread, is matcha so it has every right to be green. Lacked the tea but you get the gist of what I wrote earlier. GO and get that cupcake before they'll stop making them!

I was in Jaques Toress as well, but at that time there was classic and wicked hot chocolate and I chose both! mmm, it was VERY good.THey were both really good; the classic was just a regular hot chocolate which I found reaaally good and the other one was spicy or as it is called wicked :))
And about Pan di Stelle...Thso cookies I've been eating for years, we love them but basically anything from that brand-Mulino BIanco is extremy good, try something else next time ;)

Unintentionally Eating in Midtown (sort of)

***CONTENT
For the latter part of this week, I've been eating in Midtown. Some of the reasons are that it's closer to my campus (I'm lazy) and there's a few interesting things happening during that time during the week. (To note, I'll write about all the other places on the next post.) The first place I went twice to is Bon Appétit's Supper Club. I'll explain why as you read.The first time I went to Bon Appétit's Supper Club is mainly to get a sense of the food. If it's really tasty and it's worth the media hype it's gotten for the past week or two from NY Magazine's Grub Street and The Times.The Menu...blown upAfter reading and seeing the sandwiches, I ended up getting Govind Armstrong's Tropical Rolls with Sambal Sauce. For $7.50, it isn't too bad since it's two per order. I did take a look at the dessert table but nothing really grabbed me into getting any.SandwichesThe dessert tableAfter paying my food, the tables were nearly empty since it was early...it was 11:45 AM, and the lights weren't functioning at the time. Since I can't really take any decent food photo with nearly no lights in the seating area, I ended up taking the back of the room's cushy seating since their spotlights and lamp were the only area that is lit besides the area where the food was sold. Besides the functioning lights, it also looked pretty damn cool. Thankfully, I lugged my IS lens with me...Cushy seatingAlas, they've found out what went wrong and the lights were on! The room's pretty with the strung, reflective mirrors, clubby, but everything is so...BLUE.Seating areaThe only thing that stood out from the room was obviously the demonstration kitchen that is set front and center. The only thing that popped in my mind is, \"Would anyone pay attention to the chef when he/she is cooking?\" I mean it's Midtown, most of these people are in the publishing business or the sponsors (since most of the better tables near the demo kitchen were reserved for them) and they would basically do networking. They don't necessarily care that much about food. I know it sounds cynical, but isn't it true?Demo kitchenAnyways, going back to the food. Since the lights were back on, I grabbed a seat that has some decent lighting. The photo you see below is how the people in the front served my food. It's not exactly arranged the way I would like it. So, I took the liberty of actually placing my food differently for the sake of my mind. I know, it sounds a little OCD but that's just me.My rolls as served beforeMy rolls after rearrangingHow does it taste? It's basically a healthy, vegetarian wrap. It's rolled with a rice flour tortilla and stuffed with shredded carrots, shiitake mushrooms, watercress, and daikon. It's pretty bland by itself that it really needs the sambal dressing that came along with it to give it some spice and salt. For what I paid for, I rather get something else.After finishing those rolls, I went upstairs to check out what was given out since I heard and read that there's food samples given away. Basically, you get an ice cream bar from Häagen Dazs, wine samples, what seems like a whole ton of Evian, rum cakes and some Ghiradelli chocolate.That's a whole lot of EvianCake...Chomped Pomegranate Dark Chocolate Ice Cream BarThe second visit yesterday, it's really packed to the gills with people, and I was there only for the dessert (another ice cream bar) and the cooking demos. I ended up watching Cat Cora making a Greek chicken dish and I met Will Goldfarb!Whoa...so many people!As I walked up the stairs to grab an Evian, I saw Will Goldfarb! I didn't expect him to be here since he's not listed in their program. I said nothing since I'm doubting my eyes for the moment that it is him and the fact that I'm walking down the narrow stairs as he's climbing up. But I left it alone and grabbed a seat to watch Cat Cora cooking.Plating of the dishCat's grating the cheeseThe finished productNo, I didn't taste the chicken since it's a demo, who knows really how long ago that chicken was done. It certainly looks and smelled good but I don't want to bother. Then about ten minutes later, Will Goldfarb came downstairs with his family in tow, to the kitchen demo area.Will saw me...To explain the photo above, I was sitting on the sidelines where the non-reserved tables were located. Since I was obviously holding my camera and my huge lens is not exactly going to be unnoticed, he saw me and I heard through the talking of the lunch crowd, he said to his daughter to look at the camera (which is me) so I could take a photo of them. Here's the rest of Will's family...The family...talking to a sponsorLulu, her nanny of sorts, and WillAs the cooking demo started, he said he's going to make his mother's chocolate chip cookies. But actually, he's making fancy pants chocolate chip cookies that are sold here as well as Michel Cluizel's boutique in ABC Carpet in Union Square. Instead of making it a bit boring like the other chefs had, Will had brought along his is daughter, Lulu, to be the entertaining part of the demo. The cuteness level was amped exponentially and people actually paid attention to the demo instead of hearing murmurs of talking in Ms. Cora's demo.Lulu's stirring the cookie batterShe's washing her hands in Evian waterIn all the demo was funny, especially with the fact that Will keeps letting his daughter talk into his microphone for little comments. The most notable one was the time when she said that she has \"goopy hands\" after trying to roll the cookie dough into a log. The demo kitchen doesn't really have a sink for her to wash her hands in so what they use was a stainless steel container and filled it with bottled Evian water. Will said as a joke that, \"All restaurants uses Evian water to wash their hands with.\"After that lighthearted and cute demo, I went upstairs again and get an ice cream bar and said, \"Hi\" to Will Goldfarb since he went there with everyone in tow, his family and an older woman who seems to be the brains behind this whole production. Anyways, we exchanged greetings and he's a really nice guy, who dotes his daughter. How sweet. Also Lulu almost make me want to have a kid, besides the fact that my maternal instincts are practically zilch.To fill in the gap between those two visits of Bon Appetit, I actually had lunch at the recent opening of Five Guys.Where's the women?Never in my entire life have I ever seen so many men under one roof for the sake of a burger in Midtown. It's plainly weird to witness the fact that 98% of the people waiting are men. Anyways, this opening seems like a huge fanfare and since I love burgers, I have to know what Five Guys' burger tastes like.The menuAfter waiting ten minutes on line, I eventually ordered a \"Little Cheeseburger\" and their regular fries. It ended up costing me a bit more than $8, which isn't too bad.Witnessing the chaos of opening day and the busy lunch hour, the craze of workers trying to keep up with the demand of hungry Midtowners was mind boggling. Also hearing one of the managers scream out every once in a while for everyone in the kitchen to speed up since there's a huge group surrounding the pick-up area.Assembly line of burgersAdding the bacon...Fries stationI eventually got my lunch. The telltale signs of greasiness is showing up on my bag that I'm worried that my fries will be soggy. Here's what the food looks like.My friesLittle CheeseburgerInnardsThe fries were fine. The good part that it's actually a potato I'm eating since there were stacks of Idaho potatoes piling near the registers and it's fried in peanut oil. Generally the fries were soggy and it needs a touch more salt.The little cheeseburger I requested it to be filled with lettuce, fried onions, tomatoes, pickles, and ketchup. All burgers are made to well done, which is not my preference of how a burger should be cooked. Anyways, flavor-wise, it's a bit bland. The patty needs more salt; and the bun is soggy and characterless since it's the buns one can buy from a local grocery store. Given to the fact that it's their first day, it isn't so bad in terms of service but the food needs more time to iron out its flaws. It's not a bad place to eat in...but I wouldn't come back here too often either.Addresses: Bon Appétit's Supper Club 221 W 57th Street New York, NY 10019Five Guys 43 W 55th Street New York, NY 10019

Happy New Year! And my dinner at WD-50

I wish everyone HAPPY NEW YEAR!! Jeebus, time flew so quickly... I'll probably write a review of the past year soon, say, on the day of the new year? I'm not too sure on that. If not, I have a more personal post to write about anyways.Going back to Friday night, I went to WD-50 with Ariel for dinner since he's particularly intrigued with molecular gastronomy and Chef Wylie Dufrense since he's the only person in New York who really does this particular style of cooking. And the fact that he likes food that has weird flavor combinations.InteriorSince it was 6 PM, this is considered a bit early so there wasn't that many people. As the time passes, more diners arrived and eventually the whole place was packed.The decor is not exactly appealing. The dark blue walls and the large panel on the side of the room looks hideous. All the way in the back is the open kitchen (with Chef Dufrense peering into the dining room every so once in a while), where diners may peer in the where the plating station as well as seeing what the kitchen should look like: a mesh between a normal restaurant kitchen and a science laboratory.Sesame FlatbreadAs we perused the menu, we were tempted to try out the Tasting Menu. However, we're not willing to go all in to sit and eat for the next two hours, and risk palate fatigue. We thought about going with the appetizer, main, and dessert route but after asking the waiter about what's considered very good and weird, we ended up ordering two appetizers and a dessert for each of us (despite the fact we're sharing everything equally).Bone marrow, chestnuts, tonburi, pickled honshemejiClose upThe bone marrow, chestnuts, tonburi, pickled honshemeji was interesting, to say the least. Basically, they cook the bone marrow until it's soft enough to consume without melting into pure fat by using some kind of chemical. The chestnuts added some crunch. The tonburi, also known as mountain caviar, adds a caviar-like texture, and the pickled honshemeji mushrooms added some subtle briny tartness to the dish. Overall, I wanted to like it but the flavors were hard to pick up. Ariel didn't like this dish and considers it \"bland.\"Foie gras, mole lentils, quince yogurtThe foie gras, mole lentils, and quince yogurt was spectacular! Despite the fact we love foie in all its delicious fattiness, the intensity of the flavor contrasting with the creamy, slightly sweet and tart quince yogurt blew our minds. This was foodgasmic for both of us and we lingered and praised this dish for a couple of minutes we moved on to the next round of appetizers. All the notes hit everything on target and it really made us happy.Fried quail, banana tartar, nasturtiumAnother viewFried quail ball innardsThis dish was intriguing to Ariel's eyes when he read this off the menu because of the banana tartar. When we asked the waiter what is the banana tartar since if one puts this in the literal sense, it's just chopped bananas. However, he explained to us that the bananas are chopped, then mixed in with a tartar sauce; served with the fried quail.When we actually ate this, we felt lost. The flavor combinations were too disparate that nothing really helped the other. The banana tartar was fine - it gives a smooth and creamy texture with a slightly caramelized banana flavor. The fried quail was crisp with a touch of gaminess. The concept was creative but didn't the flavor execution didn't pull through.Smoked eel, blood orange zest, black radish, chicken skinThe smoked eel, blood orange, black radish, chicken skin was ordered for the sake that I love eel. Generally, it fared better than the bone marrow in terms of flavors. The smokiness of the eel is more tamed than what I expected but its luxurious, fatty texture still remained. The black radish, which the server said it was salsify, was delicately sweet and crunchy. I didn't hear or see the chicken skin but the added element was some type of popcorn, which give it an added dimension of crisp and crunch. I liked this dish but it's a tad too subtle for Ariel's taste for him to like it.Close upJasmine custard, black tea, bananaAnd now we move to dessert! The jasmine custard, black tea, banana got Ariel's attention since he hasn't really tried jasmine tea or jasmine anything. I think and I let him choose since I know Pastry chef Alex Stupak will not disappoint me after doing a tasting the past summer - anything goes. Anyways, the jasmine custard was very luxuriously velvety and thick; delicately flavored with jasmine and the black tea foam and ice cream add a nuance of earthiness, airiness and creaminess. The caramelized banana on the base of the ice cream goes well with the floral flavors of the jasmine custard. It's delicious.Close upSoft white chocolate, potato, malt, white beer ice creamThe soft white chocolate, potato, malt, white beer ice cream gotten Ariel's attention when we were deciding on the menu was the beer and potato combination in this dessert. When I took a spoon with everything this was the truly divine. The beer was intensely flavored without tasting alcoholic. The white chocolate and malt works with the beer ice cream to mellow out the latter and made it delicately sweeter. The potato played a minor role since it's a size of a pebble.Marshmallows and the checkClose upAfter we finished our desserts and requested the check, they gave us mini-marshmallows as petit fours. These marshmallows are so soft, it's like eating a passion fruit flavored cloud. Sure Jean Georges has marshmallows but it's all pretense and presentation but this served in a rustic fashion with the intense flavor and über light texture surpasses JG's.Overall, the savory dishes have its hits (that exhilarates us) and misses (that leaves us wondering what are we eating or thinking it's bland). Everything was presented beautifully. It's just the fact that Chef Dufresne's intellectual approach of the pleasure principle is respectful, but some dishes don't respond too well. In terms of the desserts, I never felt wronged by them that I don't mind splurging for these specifically. One day I'll do the dessert tasting.Address: WD-50 50 Clinton St New York, NY 10002

I always recommend the tasting meu at WD50.  I just find the regular menu to always be lacking.  It's neither as experimental or as good.  And never as fun.  It's almost like going to another restaurant.

Tony: We were tempted to give the tasting menu a whirl but we're not willing to splurge all the way yet. One day I'll try it out.

Happy New Year!  What a precise recap. You have lovely photos and a wonderful sense of composition!  I've always wanted to try that place but it's pricey!

Chuck: Thanks! :)
I have to ask, what camera do you use? Possibly it kind of explains why...or you could use a table tripod for stabilization.Cakewardrobe: Thanks again. It's pricey but the experience is very unique that it's worth it.

Really great pics! I ate at WD-50 in November last year and was also impressed with the wheat bear, malt and potatoe dessert!
My pics though aren't that beautiful:

The eel dish you received was NOT the one with chicken skin. That had been off the menu for some time at that point.  Perhaps that's why you couldn't taste said chicken skin.  :)  The one you did eat was served with salsify, puffed yuzu, and guava roe.

[...] About that last post...  I've been thinking it over, and I've come to the following realization: I really don't think that photographing each course and writing about it is for me.  Firstly, there were so many aspects of Saturday evening that I wanted to share but didn't, simply because the post was already so damn long.  Secondly, I didn't find it fun at all to write!  Thirdly, there are so many great sites out there that do exactly this, not to mention a plethora of writers who do a far better job and take far superior photographs — though I wonder how many were using their mother's mother's confusing camera from Hong Kong...  Check out these four who went to WD-50 within the past three months and ate similar, if not practically identical meals:  Steve Plotnicki, Mike Czyzewski, Crow and Tina Woong.

Fooding with Friends on My Last Day of Classes! (Taïm and Graffiti)

***CONTENT
Last Saturday was officially my last day of school. No more classes. No more quizzes, papers, and tests! Good riddance...at least for now. I'm giving myself a break from school for a year. Get a real job (but still go out eating, of course) and then go through the madness of applications of either law school or grad school. To kind of celebrate this event, I asked several friends to have lunch with me at Taïm.Seungmi was in the city before the supposed time where all of us should meet, I hanged out with her, browsing through a few stores on Greenwich Avenue. That's until our old high school friend, Si called me and said she's here and can't find her way in West Village since she doesn't come down here often and she goes to Cornell.Eventually we all met up and Seungmi's ranting that she's starving and threaten to pass out due to the lack of food in her stomach. Since it's about fifteen minutes 'til everyone's supposed to meet, we went into Birdbath just to warm ourselves up and Seungmi gets something to nosh on.Seungmi's Gingerbread CookieIt turned out beyond that gingerbread cookie you see above, she also gotten herself a miso apple cake. Yep, she's hungry. And she managed to eat both of them within 10 minutes before the others have called me. And we (as in me, Seungmi, Si, Ariel, and Robyn) finally meet at...Taïm!I know after reading a plethora of her posts of eating here and her boss, Ed Levine calls it the best falafel in New York. It should be guaranteed that their falafels are dead-set awesome.Robyn's Chai TeaThe 'boppy's falafel sandwichRobyn had the chai tea and the harissa falafel sandwich. If you want details of what she thought click here. From her reactions, she seemed really content and stuffed with her food.Ariel actually tried a sip of her chai and he told me that it's \"funky tasty.\" He said that there's some off-taste of rosewater and mint. I don't know exactly where that came from but I would guess he's tasting the cardamom; that spice tastes florally, citrusy-spicy to me.Ariel's SabichAriel was truly happy when he ate his sabich. Since he's born and raised in Israel, I think he knows what a good sabich or falafel tastes like. He also told me that he wants (eventually) to try out their entire menu since it's so tasty. His sabich is a white pita filled with fried eggplant, an organic hard boiled egg, hummus, Israeli salad, tahini and amba sauce. I haven't taste it but I'm considering ordering that when I come here next time.Falafel tasting plateFalafel ball dipped in tahiniAlso his falafel tasting plate arrived. Six falafel balls, consisting two of each flavor, served with a side of tahini. Since we shared this, it kind of eased my way into feeling stuffed beyond I want since I had my own falafel sandwich. Nevertheless it was delicious: crisp, ethereal exterior, soft, slightly creamy innards with a nice balance of herbs and spices.Close up of my Date, lime, and banana smoothieMy date, lime, and banana smoothie (Ariel had one as well), was quite delectable. It's predominantly flavored with bananas with a hint of date. The date contributed more in terms of texture rather than flavor since I saw fibers of it floating around. The lime wasn't really detected but it does give the smoothie an overall lightness and an acidic touch. Not too sweet. Not too thick. Nothing artificial here.Mmmm...so tastyMy harissa falafel sandwich (which is the same thing that Robyn had, as I mentioned earlier) was something close to reaching a falafel epiphany. I've eaten at a few falafel joints before but jeez, I never had a sandwich quite like this one nor made me feel like my stomach was about to burst (it's a good thing for this particular case). The falafels were crisp with a mildly spicy kick. It's stuffed with tahini, hummus, and Israeli salad. Oooh...I need to eat here more often.Before...After...she ate it allAs you have read earlier, Seungmi was famished to the umpteenth exponent that she actually ordered the humongous falafel platter. She didn't really know that she would get something that big since she doesn't know what she really ordered. But after seeing the before and after shots of her platter, she astonished me by finishing the entire thing by herself with no help whatsoever. I know she could could eat but damn she managed to eat what looks like a pound of food in one sitting.In case you're wondering what's in her falafel platter, it's the regular green falafels sitting on a thick pool of hummus, tabouli and Israeli salad, zahatar seasoned pita. Also severed with three sauces: Tahini, amba (generally, a mango sauce with vinegar), and srug (a Yemeni hot sauce). Yep, it's a lot of food.The saucesAfter eating and stuffing ourselves with tasty, fried chickpea balls, most of us parted ways with our own agendas. Ariel and I just hanged out afterwards checking out the New Museum in the Lower East Side since he's wanting to check it out for a while.HELL YES!One way to know if you're in the correct building of this museum, look for the above sign. I don't know why they chose this statement.The lobbyAwesome lamp!Since the first floor is the only place allowed for photography, that's basically what I can show you. They're showing the \"Unmonumental\" exhibit right now and slowly evolving to completion since when we went through the entire museum, they're missing the audio portion. If you're wondering what did I see, it's basically modern art showing a clash of the politics, the artists' interpretation of current events and pop culture. Conflicting, ironic, and some are just plain odd and indecipherable.Moving back to food (since this is a food blog), we walked over to Graffiti in the East Village, since Ariel went there before and loved it and I'm dying to try it out ever since I read it's opened.Interior shotsThis place is really tiny and cozy. Mostly candlelit with a few small chandeliers, eclectic Asian furnishings with a communal table, two tables toward the window and a small table on the side that has a cushy bench with pillows (which we've taken this particular spot). The music mix playing in the background matches the atmosphere, mostly playing fusion Indian music, a few Shakira songs and I remember hearing a Christina Aguilera; it's sounds like an odd mix but it does work well.As we perused the short menu, Ariel was devastated to find out that his favorite dish, watermelon, feta and mint sorbet. Let's just say it left an aching hole in his heart since he told me that he thought about that dish for days when he tried it. Our server for the evening recommended a dish that would supposedly replace Ariel's beloved dish, which was the beet and feta salad topped with balsamic olive granita.Beet and feta salad topped with Balsamic Olive GranitaI would have to say, this was an intriguing salad. It plays with the sweet (beet), salty (feta), briny (feta and olive granita) flavors, textures - crunchy (toasted almonds) and soft (feta cheese and beet), and temperature from the olive granita. Tastes very good and complex from the aforementioned description. Has it completely satisfied Ariel? Not completely. He liked it but not in love with it.Close upFoie Gras Rasberry Crostini, Walnut SaladWe chose the foie gras raspberry crostini just because we love foie. The toast gave it a nice textural contrast to the smooth, silky foie gras with a hint of tartness from the raspberry. The walnut salad was a nice touch, giving some crunch from the nut and the leaves. It's a noteworthy take on foie gras but I prefer if the raspberry flavor was a bit more stronger so it can cut the fattiness of the foie a bit more.Foie gras crostini, up closeHazelnut chocolate caviar cupcake with Chocolate chip ice creamThen came our dessert course, the hazelnut chocolate caviar cupcake with chocolate chip ice cream. The whole theme was to play with the versatility of use of 66% cacao content. The cupcake was flavored with Frangelico topped with a 66% chocolate ganache and chocolate caviar.This cupcake was excellent. It's moist, not cloyingly sweet, the chocolate flavor was improved a notch by the Frangelico's flavor (since the pairing of nuts and chocolate goes naturally well together), and the crunch of the chocolate caviar. To let you know, the chocolate caviar is not caviar enrobed with chocolate - it's like eating a chocolate enrobed sphere-shaped wafer. The chocolate chip ice cream was a delicious accompaniment to the cupcake. It adds on the depth of chocolate without killing the palate with chocolate. Balance was key and it was executed well.Innards of cupcakeWhen we asked for the check, it struck us as odd that they've given us an envelope with \"graffiti\" scrawled on it, as you'll see below.It's amusing and unique. We almost wanted to take one home as a souvenir but we didn't.Addresses: Birdbath 145 7th Ave South New York, NY 10014Taïm 222 Waverly Place New York, NY 10014Grafitti 224 E 10th Street New York, NY 10003

I was all excited to see a cupcake with caviar in it since i just made one.  Guess yours wasn't real caviar though.  Oh well.  It looks really yummy though.

You're right, Taim has the best falafel!  I'm really craving one.  The chocolate-hazlenut cupcake at Graffiti reminds me of Nutella.

Tea: There's A LOT of food here that you can go either very full and/or very broke (from eating from too many expensive places).Behgo Behgo: The falafels are AWESOME! Get to NYC, ASAP!Jessica: Taim's really tasty... Graffiti's cupcake doesn't exactly taste like Nutella since it's not as sweet and the hazelnut flavor is a bit more subdued compared to it.

My Last Goodbye to Bouchon Bakery, Tacos, and French Pastries

Last Wednesday, when most of my finals were pretty much finished, I had breakfast Bouchon Bakery for the very last time. Yes. It's time for me to give up the days where the photogenic (albeit a tad pricey) pastries are my usual go-to since I'm graduating. What I ended up commemorating this place were their wonderful bacon and cheddar chive scone and a cream cheese, orange marmalade danish.Bacon & Cheddar Chive SconeWhat's so good about this particular scone, compared to the others they have is that the texture's spot-on. It's buttery, moist, flaky, and crisp on the edges. The cheese gives it a sharp, cheesy flavor and the bacon adds on the smoky, salty punch. Oh, how I will miss this scone.InnardsThis particular danish was my first time eating it. In the past, I have tried their key lime version, which I thought it was too sweet and complicated with the graham cracker cubes that's packed with sugar, and the danish had a texture more like puff pastry than a danish, but this particular one was done well. The danish is less puff pastry-like, and the light, sweet, and slightly tart the cream cheese balances out the acidic orange marmalade.Eating my way through breakfast and have my moment of reeling in my year or so eating here (at least two to three times a week), it's time for me to bid farewell to this place and haul my butt to campus to take my last in-class final.After my final was over, I trekked down to SoHo since I've read on Chowhound about this taco place that seem to be favorable. I've read one too many posts and hear too often that tacos suck in Manhattan that one would have to be in either Queens or Brooklyn to have a good one.Pinche TaqueriaWhen I stepped into this place, I looked at their huge menu board posted above the register.The old menu...I was hoping to get myself at least a tripe taco, except when I ordered one, the woman behind the counter told me, \"Oh, that's the old menu. We don't serve that anymore.\" She gave me their new menu to look at.Taco menuBurritos and other food stuffSince that idea's in the gutter, I asked her what would she recommend. She ended up saying the roasted pork taco's good and the chicken. So, I went for both of them and have my first horchata.My First HorchataAfter reading Robyn's Red Hook posts describing horchata as \"drinkable rice pudding,\" I was hoping to get something similar. But when I drank it, it tastes like a milky, cinnamon-y drink with little bits of rice or is it almond? The latter is basically hard to distinguish since I'm not sure since it's hard and finely ground. It's not bad but I kind of wanted the same experience Robyn had.While I was waiting, I managed to take a few interior shots of this place. Not much to look at but it's a tad better than the average hole-in-the-wall with a television on the opposite side of the wall where I was sitting. This place basically focuses on the brisk take-out business for the locals.Other diners across from meAbout five minutes later, they called out my order and I picked up my tacos. So here they are...Lunchtime!Roasted chicken tacoThe roasted chicken taco was tasty from the creamy avocado, chopped onions, tomatoes, mildly spicy peppers and cilantro, all wrapped in a fresh, soft warm tortilla. The problem was that the chicken was a bit dry. If that was overlooked, the taco is pretty tasty.Roast pork tacoThe roast pork taco has the same vegetable fillings except there's no tomatoes and the pork meat is much moister. Between the two tacos, I liked the chicken's flavor more. In terms of moisture content of the meat, it's the pork. Both aren't greasy and they actually are on the small side. About two tacos should fill up a small or average eater.Since I'm not the typical eater, I craved dessert. Since I don't expect much from this taqueria, I walked out and around SoHo, thinking what do I want to eat. Rice pudding from Rice to Riches? A croissant from Ceci-Cela? But when I walked down Spring Street, remembering to pick up a few more last-minute presents, I saw the croquembouche on the display window of Balthazar Bakery. Since I've been yearning for a single-serving of that dessert for a while, I walked in.Oooh...I spy croquemboucheMe being the dessert loving person that I am, I ended up not only a croquembouche, which they superfluously called it profiteroles, but I also gotten myself a pear galette.What I ordered the profiteroles and then I let myself look at the other pastries (big mistake on my part) and inquired about this since there were small stacks of these galettes on the pastry stand. I asked him, \"What is that?\" He replied to me, \"It's a pear galette. It's pears poached first in red wine then in white wine and baked on the puff pastry.\" Somehow, I felt seduced to buy it and then I half-jokingly replied, \"Oh, that's another workout for me since there's so much fat.\" He said, \"What fat? I don't see any nutritional facts posted on the walls. Don't worry about it, it doesn't exist.\" In the end, I bought it.Were his words truthful? In a word: yes. The crisp, flaky, buttery, and slightly sticky (from the glaze) pastry contrasts the soft, sweet but not too sweet pears with hints of wine and spices. The raspberries add a touch of acidic brightness to the tart. It's very good. But I stopped myself after that bite and saved the rest for home (as dessert).Bitten/Innards shotCaramel profiterolesThey called this profiteroles instead of croquembouche just because it's sold in a smaller portion and it's filled with caramel custard rather than chocolate. I would say it's a ridiculous reason but what can I do?As for the profiteroles, it totally satiated my craving. Crunchy caramel on the outside of the soft, chewy pâte à choux filled with a lot of sweet, creamy caramel custard. Jeebus, I was a really happy girl when I ate it. I guess what really hooked me was the filling since it's not too thick and not too sweet and I don't mind eating straight up. Even though that's not the intended use but hey, a girl can dream.InnardsAddresses: Bouchon Bakery 10 Columbus Circle, 3rd Floor New York, NY 10019Pinche Taqueria 227 Mott Street New York, NY 10012Balthazar Bakery 80 Spring Street New York, NY 10012

Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year to you and your family! I'm going to skip a few posts about places I've eaten since it is time-appropriate and it's one of those rare home baking posts. Ooooh... I can bake.Mmm...cheesecake...I got this recipe that I gotten from Ina Garten's book, Barefoot Contessa Family Style and watching her show on the Food Network that made me drool when I saw the finished product. Since my mom saw that show too, she wanted my to make it and got all the ingredients for me and assigned me this task (and consume it by Christmas Eve) to recreate that cheesecake since I'm the only baker in the house.The good thing is that my best friend, Kim gave me a stand mixer to do the most of the labor last Christmas. So, I won't be screaming in pain and ask the men in my family to help me out creaming two-and-a-half pounds of cream cheese with a spatula. That would be hell.But since I left all the ingredients at room temperature, everything was fairly easy. Pour the thick, rich batter into the pre-baked graham cracker crust for a total of an hour-and-a-half (including the temperature change) and your set. Just leave in the oven (with its door open) until it cools and refrigerate.Since my mom doesn't like the idea of having a sauce with her cheesecake, she just wanted me to top it with just plain raspberries. No added sugar and no additional moisture. Though the raspberries don't look shiny in the photos, at least they add a wonderful burst of color and flavor to the cake.So, I hope you might be motivated to bake this luscious cheesecake. You will be a very happy person when you taste the results.Raspberry Cheesecake Adapted from Ina GartenFor the crust: 1 1/2 cups graham cracker crumbs (10 crackers) 1 tablespoon sugar 6 tablespoons (3/4 stick) unsalted butter, meltedFor the filling: 2 1/2 pounds cream cheese, at room temperature 1 1/2 cups sugar 5 whole extra-large eggs, at room temperature 2 extra-large egg yolks, at room temperature 1/4 cup sour cream 1 tablespoon grated lemon zest (2 lemons) 1 1/2 teaspoons pure vanilla extractFor the topping: 1 cup red jelly (not jam), such as currant, raspberry, or strawberry 3 half-pints fresh raspberriesPreheat the oven to 350 degrees F.To make the crust, combine the graham crackers, sugar, and melted butter until moistened. Pour into a 9-inch springform pan. With your hands, press the crumbs into the bottom of the pan and about 1-inch up the sides. Bake for 8 minutes. Cool to room temperature.Lower the oven temperature to 225 degrees F.To make the filling, cream the cream cheese and sugar in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a paddle attachment on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Reduce the speed of the mixer to medium and add the eggs and egg yolks, 2 at a time, mixing well. Scrape down the bowl and beater, as necessary. With the mixer on low, add the sour cream, lemon zest, and vanilla. Mix thoroughly and pour into the cooled crust.Turn the oven temperature up to 250 degrees F and bake for 1 hour and 15 minutes. Raise the oven temperature to 450 degrees. Bake for 15 minutes. Turn the oven off and open the door wide. The cake will not be completely set in the center. Allow the cake to sit in the oven with the door open for 30 minutes. Take the cake out of the oven and allow it to sit at room temperature for another 2 to 3 hours, until completely cooled. Wrap and refrigerate overnight.Remove the cake from the springform pan by carefully running a hot knife around the outside of the cake. Leave the cake on the bottom of the springform pan for serving.To make the topping, melt the jelly in a small pan over low heat. In a bowl, toss the raspberries and the warm jelly gently until well mixed. Arrange the berries on top of the cake. Refrigerate until ready to serve.Note: Measure your springform pan. The bottom of mine measures 9 inches, but it says 9 1/2. I put the springform pan on a sheet pan before putting it in the oven to catch any leaks.

Cheecake at Birdbath & Lunch at Fiamma

Notes: In case you haven't noticed, I'm approximately a week behind what I should be blogging about. Somehow after finishing school, I'm becoming a lazy bum, just procrastinating the inevitable task of writing a post. Anyways, this is a post that's taken place last Tuesday. If you want to jump to the review of my lunch at Fiamma, click here.Somehow, I went backwards that I started my afternoon with dessert. A decadent, dense one in fact: a chocolate cheesecake at Birdbath.Birdbath's pastries and COOKIES!Chocolate Cheesecake with their \"green\" surroundings on the tableThe cheesecake, as mentioned, dense, creamy with hint of chocolate flavor, despite the fact the entire thing was made of a chocolate. It's very filling for it's small size. I was a bit worried that I won't be able to stomach a lunch at Fiamma. So what I ended up doing was walking around SoHo for an hour, to burn a few calories and get a bit hungrier. Then I walked over to Spring Street to Fiamma.Chocolate Cheesecake texture shotI arrived to Fiamma around 1:30, I requested a table for myself. The maitre d' told me that they don't have any more tables but I can get a chair at the bar. Since the second floor was opened for lunch service, I walked up the stairs and to the bar. The room was packed with people, but not as hectic as Balthazar, and a lot less tourists here - most of them being the local businessmen and women.Interior of FiammaAs I perused their lunch menu, I was kind of hoping to see a dish or two that Frank Bruni praised in his review but alas, I didn't see any. So, I ended up sticking with their prix fixe menu.Green olive breadGoat's milk butter with sea saltThe bread choices were basically the green olive, that you see above, or a country white bread. The olive bread is different than most restaurants' olive bread since this one has meaty olives that doesn't taste as briny and sharp as other places do. The goat's milk butter is also an unusual yet pleasant touch since it does have a slight tangy flavor and the addition of the sea salt on top gave an extra punch of saltiness.The AmuseWhat I haven't expected was the amuse: goat's milk ricotta with a tempura-ed blossom (I don't remember what kind). The ricotta was tangy and velvety. The delicate crunch from the tempera-ed blossom made it a nice foil to the soft, creamy textures of the ricotta. It's a nice start and it seems like the Chef Trabocchi has an affinity toward goat's milk.Pouring in the \"brodo\" into the L'Uovo Alla PaveseL'Uovo Alla Pavese (after the pour)The appetizer I chose of the two choices, was the l'uovo alla pavese. To tell you honestly, I don't know what's Pavian about this dish. It's basically a slice of grilled country bread, topped with a layer of rich, sweet-acidic tomato sauce (that's the sugo finto), a poached egg perched on top with small chunks of pecorino romano cheese strewn around. The extra touch was the \"brodo\" (or broth). It tastes good, except I wish the egg was a bit more yolk-y. To me, it's like a brunch menu item with an Italian accent.Innards...not oozy enoughNon-alcoholic cocktailFor some reason, I wanted something to drink but non-alcoholic. Since I was sitting at the bar, I ended up asking the bartender to make a drink that wasn't alcoholic but I have no idea what. He told me, \"I'll think up of something.\" What he ended up was making this citrus cocktail. It's made of freshly squeezed blood oranges, orange juice, a splash of sparkling water, shaken with ice, and topped with a lemon twist. It works with my meal, since it has the tartness of the blood oranges and it isn't very sweet like I'm drinking straight up juice.Close upIl PulcinoThen came my entrée, the Il Pulcino. What makes this chicken dish a bit decadent was the small slab of foie gras, which obviously made it richer. The chicken was cooked perfectly - which isn't always an easy task whenever I order it in restaurants - the chicken meat is moist, tender, and silky. The balsamic vinegar is a nice touch to contrast the fattiness of the foie and the chicken.Close upChicory-coffee Panna CottaAs for dessert, the chicory-coffee panna cotta with fiore di latte. I really wanted to like this dessert but it didn't happen. The panna cotta's texture was spot-on: creamy with a touch of gelatin-like texture and it's not too sweet. The problem was that the chicory-coffee flavor was overbearing and a bit too bitter for this dessert but I did enjoy the fiore di latte ice cream which kind of tempered the bitterness only by a notch.As my first visit here, I liked Fiamma's savory foods more than the dessert. I wouldn't call this an Italian restaurant since it's more like an Italian touch was added to the foods. I would give it a second chance, if I had the money to splurge on their prix fixe menu (since there's no a la carte menu) but I have other restaurants planned already.Addresses: Birdbath 145 7th Ave South New York, NY 10014Fiamma 206 Spring Street New York, NY 10012

An Upper East Side Brunch at DavidBurke & Donatella and a Cappuccino in Sicaffe

***CONTENT
The past Saturday Ariel and I went out to brunch at DavidBurke & Donatella. Why in the world would I go to the Upper East Side for brunch? Well, he's been bugging me about eating there ever since the Momofuku dinner back several weeks ago. I know if his food lovin' heart is set on something, I have no choice but to tag along and be his dining companion. But then I found out the day before our brunch, he got a cold. And he still wanted to go there! Now, that's dedication.Brunch menu coverAriel and I met around 1:30 and entered the doors of this posh Upper East Side restaurant. The color schemes of the dining room is mainly red and white with a large chandelier in the center of the room with Dale Chihuly-like blown glass fixtures on the side. The latter adds a touch of Chef Burke's fun and whimsical touch to an elegant room.Interior shotChihuly-like glassAs we perused the menu for five minutes, discussing what tastes good and what he craves since he's sick, he wanted soupy, mushy food. For obvious reasons, he legitimately should crave such things but the problem is, the bisque in the brunch menu is for the slightly inexpensive menu but the entrées he want to eat is the pricier menu. What he ended up going for is expensive route (as in $35), as well as I.After thinking our orders out loud and waiting for our waiter to take our order, the bread and butter had arrived. Strangely, the bread is served in a miniature copper pan with the bread's top puffed out with a twig of rosemary stabbed right through, and the butter is set on a large pink salt slab and the butter's sculpted with a sprinkling of red sea salt. The bread tastes like a cross between a Parker House roll (its lightness and fluffy texture) and the buttery and eggy flavor of a brioche with the rosemary permeating throughout the roll. It's the most unique roll I've ever eaten but I'm not completely taken by the bread unlike the bread basket I had at Del Posto.Sculpted butterMmmm...breadOur first course has arrived. Ariel had the pretzel-crusted crabcake and I had the parfait of tuna and salmon tartares.Pretzel-Crusted CrabcakeAriel's crabcake sounded delicious and interesting: pretzel and crab cake? I would never have thought of that combination. But in reality, it tasted fine. It's basically long, thin strands of soft pretzel lining the so-called crab cake. The crab cake's texture reminds me of a tuna salad - basically crab meat mixed with mayonnaise, herbs, and some vegetables - no crunchy crust like what I would normally presume as a crab cake. It's executed well but I'm not really swooned.Innards (of my piece)Parfait of Parfait of Salmon & Tuna TartaresBut my parfait of salmon and tuna tartares was a show stopper. I'm served with this huge slab of orange-yellow salt with the cylinder of tartares and crème fraîche, three shallow pools of sauces: a mustard, miso vinaigrette and a mild chili oil. What made it had an extra flair was the long, thin strand of chive. It's really gorgeous and it does taste as good as it looks. The soft, silky fish tartares meld with the crème fraîche well to give it some tartness and the sauces did go well with them. My personal favorite was the miso vinaigrette.Close upSmoked Salmon Scramble: Before & After the mousseAriel's entrée was the Lobster scramble with salmon mousse looked like a well, scrambled eggs with chunks of lobster meat, chives and other herbs with a bunch of chives stabbed off-center to the dish. When I tasted his eggs, it wasn't noteworthy to me. But it appeals to him since, as I mentioned before, he has a cold.It's about to be eaten...The \"Reuben\" BenedictMy \"Reuben\" Benedict was basically a pair of muffins topped with pastrami-flavored salmon and Gruyère cheese with a mountain of skinny fries. It tasted good. The eggs were poached correctly that the yolk was still yolk-y and the pastrami salmon had a nice flavor of peppercorns and red pepper but it was a bit too salty. The fries were fine but I'm getting stuffed from the copious amount of potatoes on my plate that I gave Ariel a larger share.It's yolk-y...\"Crunchy\" Ice CreamThen came our dessert course. My \"crunchy\" ice cream consisted of three different scoops of ice cream: clove, cardamom, and milk chocolate. I was thinking the crunchy element would be within the ice cream but it turned out to be crushed bits of toasted hazelnuts surrounding the ice cream. It's fine for what it is but I was expecting something else. Something more complex.Ariel and his Cheesecake Lollipop TreeThroughout our entire meal, Ariel and I kept seeing the cheesecake lollipop tree going around the dining room. For obvious reasons, it is popular since people in the past might have seen it on the Food Network. When it finally graced our table, we were in awe by its presentation. How can anyone not look at this whimsical dessert? Heck, Ariel became a really happy guy when it appeared before him as you see in the photo above.This lollipop \"tree\" has three different flavors: cherry with pistachio, toffee, and dark chocolate with hazelnuts. All have the same plain cheesecake base and it's served with a bubblegum flavored whipped cream on the side.Lollipop flavorsAriel's dipping the lollipop...When I had a few of these cheesecake pops, they tasted fine. Nothing particularly extraordinary. It's basically creamy, slightly dense ball of sweetened cream cheese dipped in the flavors that was served. The whipped cream does tastes like Bazooka bubble gum but more dairy-ness from the cream. It brings the inner child out of the diner but it's evasive on my part. It's fine for what it is but it doesn't bring a foodgasm to me, unlike Ariel.Toffee cheesecake pop with bubble gum creamInnardsSicaffeAfter being stuffed from our brunch, we've paid the check and we were craving some cappuccino. Remembering a while back, Sicaffe's nearby and I thought Ariel hasn't been there yet since he usually wanders along Madison Ave. instead of Lexington. Anyways, once we stepped in, it turned out he has been there before. Somehow he thought this particular café would be he would find in his vacation to Vienna, which he never found.Despite the fact that this café is not Viennese (that would be Café Sabarsky, where I've been to a while ago), they do have great cappuccino, so both of us had the Triestino doppio. Unfortunately, the photo below of the drink is off focus since the milk foam is indistinguishable from the cup, even using manually choosing the AF point. Anyways, it still tasted great as I still remembered it: bold espresso with a nice crema and a thick milk foam. We took the coffee to go since Ariel's going to meet up a friend of his in the Upper West Side soon and there's no seats left in there.Triestino doppio, out of focusWe walked through the south border of Central Park across Manhattan. As we were going around the lake, we saw a large group of ducks floating on the water and I suddenly remembered one of Ariel's vacation photos of a swan on a lake. Strangely, Ariel said to me to take a photo so I did. Eventually, he felt the urge to take a photo of the ducks who were swimming through. I know it's not food related but heck, I liked the photo (of possibly ten) he took that you see below.Ducks swimming through...Once we reached the Time Warner Building, I left for the subways since I had to go home to study for my brutal Monday of four finals in a row and he went uptown to meet his friend.Addresses: DavidBurke & Donatella 133 E 61st Street New York, NY 10065Sicaffe 964 Lexington Avenue New York, NY 10021

First of all, David Burke & Donatelly looks stunning. The presentations are fabulous. A friend of mine worked there for externship...I will tell you about that. Crazy business I'm telling you.
Then I wanted to comment you about Viennese coffee which I enjoy drinking every now and then, and I was about to write you about Cafe Sabarsky and there you go! You have been there!! I was thinking of doing my externship there. I was there with my friend Stacey (you will meet her, everything I do is Stacey involved, hehe, you will see, she's the best!). I did not have coffee there, because I was sick, I had tea and S. had hot chocolate and she was amazed how it was served. Have you tried any pastries? I tried an apple strudel which didn't have anything to do with real apple strudel and we had Sacher torte which was just ok, the one at Demel is waaaay better. Well, Demel is coming soon on the City and I'm so curious how will their pastries and cakes taste.
Gotta go to bed! NIght night!

Tea: Yeah DavidBurke & Donatella is stunning. My friend Ariel loved the place.
You know so many people in the resto business, girl! :) Why don't you hook me up earlier?! Haha...I'm kidding. Sorta.At Cafe Sabarsky the only pastry I tried was the sachertorte. It was like you said, ok. Not bad, not transcendent either.Honestly, I never heard of Demel. Hmm...I need to do some research.Oh, the photo of the ducks have been taken by Ariel! Haha, all I did was edit the lighting, colors, and whatnot. I'll pass along the compliment to him! (You'll meet him when we're eating at Jean Georges, btw.)Night, sweetie! :)

That cheesecake lollipop tree looks cool! For some reason when I see something like that it automatically seems like it would taste good. Too bad you didn't get foodgasm from it though. The pictures look great as always.

Why Did I Miss Out on You, Will? (Dessert Studio at Michel Cluizel)

***CONTENT
Earlier before I had my actual late lunch with Sam (last Thursday) on the previous post, I did have an eye-opener of a dessert tasting at Dessert Studio at Michel Cluizel inside the luxurious bohemian housewares store, ABC Carpet & Home. This particular dessert bar, if you will, is ran by the well known, avant-garde pastry chef, Will Goldfarb, who used to run Room 4 Dessert about a year ago, which I admit I haven't been to.Anyways, back to the story. I went there around 1:30 on the awful Thursday afternoon with the cold wind and rain. I just thought of having something sweet or intriguing for the sake of making me happier. Hey, I love sweets; make it interesting and delicious, you got me.I grabbed a table in this tiny seating space where lights were dim, not many people were here since it is bad outside and I don't think anyone would want a full blown dessert at this time of the day...besides me. As I waited for the server to arrive, which is basically the same people who help out on the chocolate counter, I just perused the short dessert menu. Just look below.The Booze PageNon-boozy stuffThat's what I'm here for!Strangely for some reason, after looking through the entire menu, I wanted a drink. And I mean a drink drink, meaning a cocktail. I can't explain why. Probably I want to have a moment of kicking back before finals and drift into my hour or so of being free without worries of books, papers, and grades? Maybe. But whatever I felt, I ended up ordering their Chocolate Infused Martini since they use their own special cacao pods and infuse it with vodka. What my server told me, it's not the same as the sweet version of that cocktail that most of us are familiar with the chocolate martini. Along with that drink, I went for the full dessert tasting menu.Chocolate Infused MartiniThe 3 Chocolate PearlsThe martini's not sweet at all. Being the novice cocktail (or any booze for that matter) drinker that I am, my tastebuds aren't exactly honed to break down to you what I tasted. All I tasted throughout the entire drink was basically the raw, earthy, slightly bitter chocolate from the cacao pod infused vodka with that strong zing of alcohol at the end. Since almost every martini usually have olives adorned on the drink, the substitute the olives for chocolate pearls. And yes, it does taste like alcohol with a faint hint of 72% chocolate, when I ate them at the very end.White chocolate gelatoSpoonedMy first course, white chocolate gelato with Ligurian olive oil. Looks and sound simple but it tastes like a symphony. I would daresay this is very similar to Otto's olive oil gelato, if you ever had that. It sounds weird but it's wonderful. The rich, florally vanilla flavor. Creamy, dense gelato with salty crunches of smoked salt mingling with the florally olive oil.Chocolate CakeInnardsThen came along the 72% chocolate cake with Piedmont hazelnut topped with preserved apricot and brown sugar ice. Most of it sounds familiar except for the combination of hazelnut and apricot (to me) and I never thought of having brown sugar ice. Anyways, the cake was moist and it's made with crushed bits of toasted hazelnut. The apricot gave it a subtle amount of acidity and the brown sugar ice adds a temperature difference and a faint touch of sweetness. It's not my favorite dessert since the apricot's sharpness dominated the chocolate cake's flavor more than balancing it and it's not sweet enough.Indonesian Vanilla Ice Cream & American Sturgeon caviarThe chocolate bits...Texture shotThe Indonesian vanilla ice cream and American Sturgeon caviar is the most exotic of the entire menu albeit sounds the most luxurious due to the application of caviar. How does it taste like? Well, when I ate the first bite of the ice cream and the caviar, it was quite divine. Dense, rich, vanilla ice cream with floral notes and heady vanilla flavor meets little \"pops\" of saltiness from the caviar. Interesting indeed. When I actually found the chocolate bits (which are 85%, not the 72% my server told me since I ate them alone), it adds an earthy element contrasting the lightness to the ice cream. This is another favorite.Wanna bite?\"Chantilly\" of milk chocolate with Earl Grey sorbet and grapefruit segmentsThe milk chocolate \"chantilly\" was another citrus element that Mr. Goldfarb was playing around with. (Side note: around this time, he actually arrived in person.) The dense yet airy milk chocolate was complemented with the floral acidity of the grapefruit and the deceptive Earl Grey sorbet. I said \"deceptive\" just because when I ate this before paying attention to the menu, it was creamy like an ice cream. This was nicely balanced and the chocolate remained the background flavor instead of being overpowered by the other elements.Just to let you know, if you read the menu on the chantilly, it's in quotes just because it's just a French word. Nothing weird added (e.g. some edible food chemicals that he uses) or anything like that: it's just whipped cream and milk chocolate.Fluffy texture...A little bit of everythingWarm Chocolate Bubbles and Fresh Milk FoamThen the final course, warm chocolate bubbles and fresh milk foam. The warm chocolate is basically warm chocolate ganache, possibly around 72% cacao content, from the taste of it. It's aerated with nitrous oxide when I asked Mr. Goldfarb about it.When I ate the warm chocolate with the fresh milk foam, it reminds me of a hot chocolate with the cappuccino's foamy top with a hint of espresso, since the menu did mention there's espresso jelly in it. When I dug out the jelly from the bottom of the glass, the jelly was explosively flavorful. The espresso flavor's extremely bold yet it's not bitter. Whatever coffee beans and roast he used, I would certainly get a bag of them. I guess if you add up these two different tastes together, I would daresay this is a whimsical yet sophisticated version of mocha in dessert form with a light texture due to the aeration of the ganache.Spoon of Warm Chocolate Bubbles and Fresh Milk FoamSpoon of Warm Chocolate bubbles and espresso jelloAfter finishing that dessert, I was a bit tipsy (due to the earlier chocolate infused martini) yet overall quite satisfied with these desserts.I'm just wondering why did I miss out on Room 4 Dessert a few years ago? I love the innovative ideas and applications to his desserts. Will's a natural host after I briefly chatted with him and observed him talk to a few customers around the boutique when a lot more people started to come in when I left. It's sad that he lost that place but I'm happy that he's still around New York that I can hopefully linger in the tiny space whenever I want some interesting chocolate-based dessert.Address: Dessert Studio at Michel Cluizel in ABC Carpet Co. 888 Broadway New York, NY 10003

One time, Will told me that his signature dish at Room 4 Dessert was an Epoisse (cheese) ice cream sandwich.  I finally tried plain Epoisse at the new Whole Foods on Bowery this year.  I thought, \"That man is a genius!  This would go great in dessert!\"  By then, Room 4 Dessert was closed.  :-(  I'm glad he's back at Michel Cluizel.

it all sounds amazing! well except the caviar i dont quite like the way it taste to much.what i like the most is that from what you seem to describe none of it was to heavy i find a lot of times chocolate desserts can end up being to heavy, or rich and hard to eat more then one kind of chocolate cake or dessert in one sitting

I hope the right investors will see light and rush to get a piece of action!
I would not let him struggle behind the bar..but just let him sell his ideeas!
I will play Lottery..Will..will be my first investment.
Promise !!!

Giulia: You don't really taste the caviar much since the vanilla ice cream masks the fishy, briny taste; only I could taste was the hint of salt and texturally, the \"pop.\"Chocolate desserts, in general are heavy but not these. Will actually achieved a balance in terms of textures in all of these desserts.Walter: As a third person just watching him for a few minutes, he does seem happy. But I do recognize the fact that he has so much more potential and expand his business.

I can't believe you ate all that! I would be so sick after one dessert. I'll have to take a few friends so I can try all the things you ate. I'm intrigued by the chocolate bubbles and earl grey sorbet.

Kim: I don't know about that. I mean, the desserts weren't that sweet at all and portion size is small. It's not like you should be jumping off the walls from the sugar...unless of course, you are sensitive to sugar.

The past Thursday, when the weather in NYC was atrocious: it rained then changed to sleet, transformed to snow, then back to the pouring of rain. Isn't Mother Nature great?! Sighs... The good thing was that fact I don't have classes but I had to study for my finals since they're starting on Monday (4 finals in a row = mind suicide).Anyways, ever since I had my previous dinner at Momofuku Ssam with Sam and a bunch of other friends, I never really hanged out or went fooding with him. Since he's going back to his hometown in Missouri next week and I don't have time due to the aforementioned finals, I made time from my study schedule and had a late lunch with him at Boqueria.BoqueriaInteriorThe SpecialsDespite the fact that we're practically the few diners, it feels like a casual, comfortable place to hang out with a couple of friends to eat and drink.About five minutes after we got seated, our waitress told us that the kitchen is about to close soon (it's near or a little past 3) so we have to choose our hot tapas soon before they'll switch over to their menus. After that warning, we just chose our three tapas dishes and a media racion.CojonudoIt's tiny...The cojonudo, which is fried quail eggs with chorizo on toast, was pretty tasty, despite it's two-biter size. The porky, spicy, peppery bite of the chorizo with the gooey egg yolk oozing out after sinking the teeth into the crunchy toast - it's pretty darn awesome. I just don't know if it justifies the price tag of $6.Pintxos MorunosThe pintxos morunos, which is grilled lamb skewered and topped with finely chopped parsley, was tasty as well. The bright, acidic marinade that that lamb was sitting in hid the natural gaminess. The cumin that's also marinated in this dish added a slightly smoky flavor. The good part was that the lamb's cooked to a medium-rare, so it's in a nice shade of pink. So tender...Lamb innardsXipirones y XocoaThe xipirones y xocoa seemed like the most intriguing dish from the entire menu: grilled baby squid with cocoa and hazelnut vinaigrette. The squid's cooked perfectly, that I'm not eating a piece of chewy rubber. The cocoa and hazelnut bits on top gave it an earthy, crunchy texture to the tender squid. Flavor-wise, the cocoa was really subtly flavored that I really have to pay attention to the fact that I'm tasting cocoa since the bitterness was subdued. The hazelnut was a bit more prominent since it does have that rich, nutty flavor.Croquetas CremosasAnd finally the pièce de résistance, the croquetas cremosas. I know I used a French word for a Spanish dish but it is what I said. This tapa contained three different croquettes: mushroom, ham, and salted cod. All three were creamy with some differences, of course. The creamiest of the three was the salted cod. Jeebus, if every croquette was that creamy, I would die happily from the excess fat and starch since I wouldn't mind eating bucket loads of them!The über thin, crisp, crust meets light, fluffy, creamy potato with fibers of salted cod smushed within - it's just so delicious accompanied by the lemon aioli. The ham was good but not as awesome as the cod since the bits of ham interrupted the creaminess of the filling. The interesting part was the fig paste that went along with this croquette: sweet meets savory. The mushroom was also very good due to the use of truffle oil in the aioli. There were bits of mushrooms but the size wasn't as large as the ham. I don't have an innards shot for you for this particular croquette. Sorry. I would have to say, these croquettes are almost as good as Degustation.Another view...Creamy, dreamy croquette...Creamy meets chunky ham bitsMushroom CroquetteAfter finishing our food, the waitress wanted to know if we wanted extra tapas or dessert? We thought about it for several minutes and decided to go against it and wander around the neighborhood in the rain. So we paid the check and walk out in the cold, wet streets of Chelsea.Since Sam isn't a sweets/dessert freak like I am, he wanted some coffee and he reminded me of Cafe Grumpy. It's been a long while since I actually last visited there. I trust his taste in coffee since he works at Bouchon Bakery and we talk a lot about food and we agree on most terms about what tastes good. Also he seems to know a tad more about coffee than I do. While we were waiting for our espresso drinks, Sam actually talked a bit about Bouchon's coffee and his preference on Grumpy's Kenyan espresso since he likes the coffee's berry profile. Honestly, I don't really pay attention to particular origin coffees since most taste the same but the different roasts make a difference to what I taste and I also care about how they make their espresso (e.g. the barista must be grinding the beans on the spot when the coffee was ordered, not by the push of a button and you get the espresso. The latter is garbage.).My CappuccinoSam's Kenyan espresso with water on the sideI'm really content with this espresso. The lovely crema from the espresso shot. The robust, bitterness of the espresso bean softened by the velvety milk foam. Oh, this was wonderful to warm myself up after walking several blocks over in the cold with the wind and rain pouring down.Lovely crema...Judging by Sam's espresso, it looks quite awesome. The thick, rich, dark brown crema is a strong sign that this espresso was done correctly and it will taste exquisite.So we grabbed a seat in this slightly crowded cafe and chat for half an hour until I had to go home and stick my nose to my books and study.Addresses: Boqueria 53 W 19th Street New York, NY 10011Cafe Grumpy 224 W 20th Street New York, NY 10011

What an interesting day you had (except the studying part). All of the things you ordered were quite interesting I have to say.
What amazes me the most was the Cafe Grumpy and how the espresso was served as it SHOULD. Not in the stuuupid paper cups, ahhhh I hate that. Is it rare in NY that you get it served with a glass of water? BAck home and here in Vienna it's a must. Hey, you have probably been to Joe and the art of coffee. Tell me about it! I want to go when I come back ;)

Tea: It's more like interesting three hours but uh, it counts as a day for me from studying!Anyways, the food's pretty good. When it comes to Grumpy's coffee, YES! That's how coffee and espresso should be made and served. But it's 98% true that water is served along with the coffee unless requested.As for Joe's, I think you know by now that I LOVE their coffee. As for their espresso drinks, well, it depends who's making your beverage since I had some hits and misses.We will go to both (or more) when you come here! :)

Giulia: I wouldn't ever think of having squid like that either! But it turned out to be tasty. Yummy.Thanks for the wishes! :)Danny: Yes, it's \"Yom yom\" if I spoke like Robyn. Thanks for the compliment.Tapas aren't exactly cheap but it's not too bad either. Our meal cost us $20, including tax and tip, and we were satiated.

Over the weekend, I wanted to go brunching for some reason. Maybe because of feeling restless from sitting on my butt in front of my laptop writing papers ENDLESSLY or studying from law textbooks just makes me want to blind myself? Possibly... So, for a few days before Saturday, I've contacted my almost dependable fooding friend, Ariel to ask if he wants to have brunch? After exchanging e-mails infrequently that I known practically last minute where and when we're meeting. Thanks to my iPod Touch's WiFi capability, I got the message before leaving the city and abandon Ariel.Anyways, we met on Saturday at 3 at Houston and Broadway and eventually walked over to the Lower East Side. Honestly, we don't really know where we're eating. We're basically roaming around a few places that he had in mind that strikes his fancy. We stopped by some Latin bistro/tapas place somewhere in the LES, but I don't remember where it was. All I can recall was that it was a pastel pink exterior and the name started with \"A.\" It didn't appeal to me at all and eventually Ariel changed his mind and he wanted to go to Stanton Social.We started to walk on Stanton going east since I don't wander around the LES that often and depending on Ariel that he knows where he's going since he said he passed by this place a few times. Once we were on Clinton & Stanton, we stopped and I was thinking out loud, \"Wait a minute...This doesn't seem right. We're heading toward WD-50.\" Ariel thought a minute and said, \"We should be going the right way...I think?\" Since we're doubting ourselves, Ariel whipped out his cell phone and called his younger brother and hope that he would actually give him the address. But since his bro didn't pick up, I just remembered about my iPod! I prayed mentally that I could pick up a WiFi signal. And yes, it worked! I managed to Google: Stanton Social and I got the address. It turned out, as expected, we were heading the wrong direction. We're supposed to head out east, not west.Stanton SocialWe finally made it to Stanton Social. It was relatively...calm. Not as raucous and noisy as many people over at Chowhound say but then again, it's almost 4 PM. Waay past brunch hours and it's nearly early dinner. Only four tables were occupied, including ours, and the only disturbance were the occasional loud laugh, small groups of people having an animated discussion, and the blast of lively dance and jazz music.The moody, dark lighting with the dark wooden paneled walls and large cylindrical lamps makes this place looks posh. Add the chocolate suede banquettes...yep, it's trendy alright.Since we arrived past the brunch hours and in the gray area between brunch and dinner, we have a limited menu of what they called it, \"afternoon snacks.\" To Ariel, it's his late lunch since he kept telling me he's starving ever since I met him in SoHo. As for me, this is my prelude to my actual dinner at home within two hours. (Sorry, I haven't taken the menu photo.)Interior toward the frontInterior looking toward the backWe ordered four small dishes, since they serve tapas here. Not in the traditional sense, mind you. Here's the first batch that arrived to our table:Foreground: Potato and goat cheese pierogiesThe potato and goat cheese pierogies with caramelized onions and truffled crème fraîche were quite appealing. The first thing I noticed while taking photos were the strong, seductive scent of truffles. The slight crunchiness of the exterior, sweetness from the onions, muskiness of the truffled crème fraîche, all collide with the creaminess of the potato and goat cheese filling. It's an endearing start.Foreground: Pumpkin & goat cheese croquettesThen we moved on to the pumpkin and goat cheese croquettes. It might seem like we're on a goat cheese craze but it's not entirely on purpose. These items seem to be the more appealing of the few that's listed on the menu. Anyways, these croquettes are the second best we've eaten so far (Degustation's is top notch). The light, crisp, crunchy exterior meets the velvety goat cheese with small bits of pumpkin. The sauce that the bottom of the croquette taste like crème fraîche and balsamic vinegar. It actually highlights the tartness of the cheese and some sweetness from the vinegar. Lovely.French Onion Soup DumplingsThen our other plates arrived. The French onion soup dumplings and somehow, we've gotten another round of pierogies. We noted that mistake to the waiter, since we're supposed to have the Red Snapper tacos. What eventually happened was that they let us keep the pierogies (for free) and several minutes later, the tacos graced our table.Going back on the dumplings, the cheesy crust that's on top of the entire platter was starting to harden since there was some struggle on Ariel's part to lift a dumpling with the toothpick. But alas, he was successful (as you'll see below)...Gooey cheese...The dumpling was good. A slightly chewy dough contained a bit of the savory-sweet French onion soup. It's not the best thing I've ever tasted, despite a number of raves I read on Chowhound. It's an interesting concept but somehow it doesn't make me fall to my knees when I ate them.The red snapper tacos with fiery mango and avocado salsa, as indicated on the menu, seem like a really tasty item. Somehow, they came out to be ok, at best. The crunchy corn taco shell with the shredded bits of red snapper meat, cilantro, cubed mango, and peppers didn't build up to what I would imagine a spectacular taco. It wasn't really spicy, maybe a fizz of heat and I don't really remember tasting much of avocado. Looks pretty but kind of bland, taste-wise.Strangely, from those five plates we were stuffed. We called it quits and paid the check.Stanton Social isn't a bad place. Maybe we came at a bad time since it's past it's prime hours of brunch or dinner? The decor is attractive. This would be a great place to hang out with a bunch of friends, have a few drinks and have a good time during the evenings or the weekend. It does deserve a second chance but I'm not exactly rushing to come back either.Address: Stanton Social 99 Stanton Street New York, NY 10002

I always wonder what a good fish taco taste like. The only time I had it was in california, by the beach; the circumstances surrounding the taco itself made it enjoyable. Are there good taco places you have visited in the city?

Danny: I dunno what a good fish taco taste like. But generally, Mexican food kinda sucks in NYC unless you really want to make a trek Uptown in the 100s Streets or out in the boroughs. I personally haven't tried many taco places since I don't have that craving often. So, I can't help you there.Rich: Oh! I'm offended! No, I'm kidding...maybe. I don't mind if Apple does pay me to name drop them every once in a while but obviously that isn't true. I just love my iPod Touch and it was handy for this trip before we wasted a few hours getting lost.

He he. The iPhone is that little bit handier with the Google Maps feature; I've added the contact details of all the restaurants I want to try to my phone book, so on a whim I can just tap the address and it brings up the location on Google Maps ^__^

Note: If you want to jump to the review of my lunch at Del Posto Enoteca, click hereI'm summarizing my old stuff since it's not really notable, per se. What I'm referring to were my visit to Macaron Cafe (which you can start viewing photos and my comments on them from here) and a lunch at Balthazar at their bar since there weren't any tables available when I visited that afternoon (those food photos start here).Just to sum it up, the macarons from Macaron Cafe were hit-or-miss but it's really inexpensive. From what was available that morning: cranberry, chocolate, and key lime (which I bought one of each), the best of the three was the key lime but a far cry from Pierre Herme's heavenly macarons. They're the size of my palm (about 3 1/2 inches) for $2. It's the cheapest in the city so far.A Tower of HUMONGOUS MacaronsLunch at Balthazar was and always packed from the multiple times visiting or passing through in SoHo. I had their duck confit and chocolate pot de Creme and a glass of vintage cider, Cidre Bouche Organic E. Dupont 2006.The duck confit was good: thin, crisp skin meets soft, tender duck meat that melts in my mouth but my tiff was was supposed to be the \"crisp potatoes\" indicated on the menu. I was assuming wedges of potatoes sauteéd to a lovely golden brown but it turned out to be small potato chips. Go figure. The cider was nice, a touch of alcohol but it isn't as boozy as any other wine or beer you'll ever encounter. The chocolate pot de creme was creamy and chocolate-y rich. Think dense chocolate pudding served with coconut shortbread cookies on the side. Overall a decent lunch but for my money's worth, I would go somewhere else.Duckie! Confited.Chocolate Pot de CremeThen yesterday morning, I went down to the West Village for the sake of making reservations in one of the hottest restaurants in town, Babbo. Robyn, Kathy, and I flirted this idea multiple times of going there but we know it's almost impossible to get a table without a reservation. I had a discussion recently with my friend Giulia. Giulia loves and craves the fabulous food she had in Italy from her vacation about a year ago, I told her about Babbo and eventually this idea became concrete and I motivated myself to get an elusive reservation.After our discussion, I Google mapped out where Babbo is, and it turned out that it's a block away from my beloved Joe on Waverly Place. What I did was work out at my gym early morning, leave around 9, grab my cup of joe from Joe and wait outside in the cold in front of Babbo.My cup of joe from Joe to warm me upBABBO!So after taking the pain of lingering out in the cold for ten minutes (and I almost recovered from my cold), my mission's accomplished! Many thanks to Kathryn for the tip she posted on Chowhound!Ok, enough about old news (some nearly 2 weeks old)...I went to Del Posto Enoteca yesterday for lunch. I don't want to be splurging for the whole Tasting Menu at Del Posto restaurant to save a bit for my Babbo dinner, hence I opted for the Enoteca.Del PostoEntering through their doors, I was a bit astounded by the huge space. It's dimly lit, a bit palatial, covered in soft carpeting and marble floors as you go up the stairs leading to the maitre d'. I didn't have any reservations, since I'm assuming that Opentable is only meant for the restaurant side. I requested for a table for myself at the there and was immediately seated.Usually, an enoteca would be the wine bar except this is Del Posto, things have to be more finesse and upscale so they created a lounge area with the bar and a few tables across the room where it is the main dining room.Here's several interior photos:Looking toward the maitre d' area and behindLooking up at the balconyThe barCool lampsMain Dining Room areaEventually, I was greeted with the waiter and gave me their menu. Comparing with what was online, it changed slightly, as you will see the photos. I ended up going for the prix fixe menu since it's basically 4 courses for $45, which isn't so bad at all comparing to other fine dining establishments in the city.Page 1Page 2After ordering, came the bread basket. Usually whenever I'm served with bread in any restaurants, I'm not amused with them since they're usually served cold and sometimes a few were stale since they are outsourced by another bakery. But this was not the case. These warm, lovely, yeasty rolls were made in-house and they were amazing. Crisp and crusty with soft, pillowy innards...I'm in carb heaven. My particular favorites of the bread basket were their mini baguette (they should sell these, practically the best in the city), focaccia (so light and not greasy), and the olive roll (lots of olive chunks). By the end of my meal, I nearly ate the entire basket.A basket full of tastiness...Innards of focacciaOlive roll innardsBaguette innardsBaguette + schmear of lardoThe lardo served with the bread and the typical sweet butter was very delicious as well. As you think it sounds, lardo is lard; meaning rendered pork fat that's solidified, flavored with salt and lots of black pepper. It's unbelievable that the pig have so many scrumptious uses.The LARDOButtaMy antipasto course was Grilled Octopus with Fagioli Diavoli & Cavolo Nero. Basically it's octopus tentacles grilled served with a Tuscan kale and dark brown beans. The octopus was grilled to tender perfection. The kale gave it a tangy bite with a sweet aftertaste and the beans with its chewy skin and creamy innards worked well together.Grilled OctopusInnardsThen came my first \"taste\" for the primi course: Spaghetti alla Vongole. What I thought I read from the menu when it said, \"BIS: A sharing of two tastes for the entire table,\" was referring to two tiny portions or bites but it came out to be two small appetizer sized plates of pasta. Obviously, this ended up to be a lot of pasta.The spaghetti was chosen out the suggestion from my waiter which turned out to be a good recommendation. The spaghetti's cooked al dente with a light touch of tomato sauce and bits of small clam meat tangled in the strands of pasta. All balanced nicely.Spaghetti alla VongoleWant a bite?After finishing that plate off and waiting several minutes later, arrived my second \"taste\" the Garganelli alla Bolognese. The garganelli was housemade penne pasta cooked with a velvety, meaty Bolognese sauce. The Parmesan cheese added on top of the dish was a nice touch to give it an extra salty bite with a touch of cheesy funk.Personally, I liked the spaghetti a bit more than the garganelli due to its delicate flavors.Server grating the parm...yes, it's out of focusGarganelli alla BologneseMy Secondi or second course (I know, it's seems like the fourth by now), the Beef Brasato with Cauliflower Ragu. The beef, which I was told, came from the shoulder, was braised into a tender, melt-in-your-mouth cut of meat. It's so tender that I don't need a knife to cut it. The cauliflower ragu portion was possibly a misnomer since I only had one floret of cauliflower while the rest were carrots and other root vegetables.Bite of beefAs I was eating my beef, the Executive Chef Mark Ladner made several appearances to the main dining room, plating and talking to the diners. Interestingly enough, I also saw the Pastry Chef Nicole Kaplan made an appearance earlier as well. I have to say, Mr. Ladner looks kinda cute...Executive Chef Mark LadnerWaiting out a bit for my dessert, it finally arrived; my Torta del Nonno. It's basically a tart that is filled with chocolate ricotta, sprinkled with toasted pignoli (or pine) nuts. It's executed nicely despite the fact that I think it's a tad grainy due to the ricotta. What I really liked about the tart was the use of a high cocoa percentage in the chocolate and the pignoli nuts were so buttery besides giving it a textural contrast to the creaminess of the filling.Torta Del NonnoSpoonedIt's a very good meal, albeit a very large one for me for a reasonable price. The most memorable thing in that meal was the bread basket and lardo, even though it's arguable that it's not part of the meal. The dishes I recommend to you are the grilled octopus and the spaghetti alla vongole. I can't vouch for the dessert too much since it didn't exactly blow me away but I did like it.Addresses: Macaron Cafe 161 W 36th St New York, NY 10018Balthazar 80 Spring Street New York, NY 10012Joe 141 Waverly Place New York, NY 10014Del Posto Enoteca 85 10th Avenue New York, NY 10011

OK, I was in Del POsto. I friend of mine surprised me and a few other friend and took us there. One of the best experiences I ever had. We had this special 5-course meal, for I think $50, which was fantastic! The food was just stunning, oh Gosh....when I remember it...And the bread basket with the lard and other smoked goodies, oh my!! When I graduate in September I am taking m parents there.
By the way, there is something about Mark Ladner....

Rich: Ah, thanks...some of the credit was due to Kathryn for giving me that excellent suggestion of securing one. I just need to get my lazy butt down there.I think that applies to everyone (who isn't carb phobic), who would eat warm bread for any meal!

I'm curious to find out what you think of Babbo.  The first time I went I was blown away. The 2nd time was just eh. The service can be pretty poor. Your writing and photos always makes me hungry.

Kim: Stay tuned for that post! The date of the actual meal is on Jan. 6th, so it's going to be soon...Haha...thanks for the compliment. My intention is to make thee hungry. ;)

I must admit that you are all right about Mark Ladner...he is one  hot chef.  Mind you, I may be a little biased because I am his aunt.  I'm in CA and haven't had the chance to go to del Posto yet.  I envy you New Yorkers who get to enjoy his culinary genius at all 3 of his restaurants.

The day after the Devi lunch that I had with my three girl friends, I've coordinated another lunch with another group of friends, Robyn, Kathy, and Ariel to Cafe Boulud.Interior shotKathy, Robyn, and I met up on time while we're waiting a bit for Ariel since he's traveling uptown from the Financial District, so we perused the menu and chatted a bit while we're waiting for him.Kathy & Robyn making an odd face...The bread server walked to our table and told us the options for the moment: a plain roll or a slice of pumpkin bread. We all chose both and gave us soft butter.Plain Roll & A Slice of Pumpkin BreadBUTTER...The plain roll was fine, but the pumpkin bread was better. It's not so much as pumpkin flavored than I would normally expected - more like sourdough/yeast fermentation flavor nuanced with a hint of nutmeg and allspice and crunchy toasted pumpkin seeds.Then finally, Ariel arrived and we all ordered our food. When it comes to the appetizer, only one dish really got our attention - the duck terrine.Duck TerrineThe terrine, a few slices of coarsely textured duck meat and fat mixed with pistachios was smooth with bits of crunchiness from the nuts and the toast points that accompanied them. The pain was actually trying to eat the terrine with a knife and fork since my toast was flying across the table whenever I'm cutting the toast into bite sized pieces, but the itself dish was fine.As for our mains, Kathy and Ariel got the stuffed skate wing, Robyn got herself some beef stuffed two ways, and I got the mushroom raviolini. Basically, we all got to try a little bit of everything here.Stuffed Skate WingThe skate was very moist, tender and sweet fish. The swiss chard delicately brought in a touch of pungent, bitterness - almost spinach-like to my tastebuds, while the caper relish brought a salty bite. It's a nice combination but nothing extraordinary about the dish. Just good solid cooking.Beef Two WaysRobyn's beef was very tender and cooked to a medium-rare. The bernaise sauce is a traditional accompaniment to steak. I haven't tried the beef brisket cannelloni (the cylindrical item that's blurred on the background) since it's quite small. It's executed nicely but I didn't feel swooned by the flavors.Mushroom RavoliniFinally, we move onto the mushroom raviolini. These pockets of pasta was very good. The pasta was al dente, the mushroom was intensely flavored, enriched with the port wine and shallots. The parmesan foam was a different take of the traditional shavings of parmesan cheese to top off the dish - it had the right balance of rich earthiness and pungent saltiness.After our plates were cleared, chatted amongst each other and our neighboring table for several minutes, we get to eat dessert.Molten Cake & InnardsAriel's chocolate molten cake looks pretty with the mosaic design on top of the chocolate by the use of chocolate transfer sheets. (In case you don't know what are chocolate transfer sheets, take a look here.) After Ariel dug into its gooey, chocolate center, I was surely beyond curious how does it taste and gotten myself a conservative bite since he's still sick. It was good - dark chocolate (say, 68% cacao content), smooth and thick with a thin exterior of a cake. Not to say I'm weak in the knees for it but it was fine for what it is.Meyer Lemon TartKathy had the Meyer lemon tart. It's very adorable the way it's presented - little mounds of Meyer lemon curd while the middle was filled with cream (I think? I didn't take notes) and little sprinkles of meringue that Ariel thought they were marshmallows at first glance. The tart was smooth, light and refreshing with the slightly crisp, buttery pâte sucrée. Admittedly, I haven't tasted the fromage blanc ice cream since it's just a quenelle as a serving size. Everything was harmonious and tasty but I guess I was anticipating something more about this tart.Peanut Caramel Milk Chocolate & a Close UpRobyn and I had the peanut caramel milk chocolate tart since it's the most unusual sounding dessert from the entire list of choices. The thin, crisp chocolate pâte sucrée melded well with the peanut caramel filling, thin, dark chocolate (about 62% cacao) shell, and little piped mounds of milk chocolate mousse on top. It's arguably a sophisticated form of a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup but in a tart form and not as intensely peanut butter flavored and the addition of caramel as the main component. It tastes good and as well as the creamy, smooth peanut ice cream.While we're eating our desserts, Robyn took photos of us noshing our sweets...Ariel and I eating; from Robyn's Flickr PhotostreamAm I blown away by Cafe Boulud by this lunch? Not really. My thoughts after talking about our lunch briefly to Robyn's boss, Ed Levine at Serious Eats afterwards (I'll explain why in the next post), I think they \"dumbed it down\" since the food served at this time isn't usually found in their regular menu and the flavors are pretty much standard, not extraordinary like what Mr. Bruni had raved about. I would give them a second chance but not during Restaurant Week.Address: Cafe Boulud 20 E 76th Street New York, NY 10021

Tina! This was definitely a lunch where the company counted more for me than the food! I think we paid more for the ambiance, or real estate time if you will, to enjoy our meal. Plus, we just never get enough opportunities to eat together! :)P.S.
Didya check out those two hot guy on the table next to us as we were leaving? teehee ;)

Kathy: Yeah, company certainly did counted more! It's kinda sad actually... We NEED to hang out more! ...that's when I get some stability in my life (e.g. a job). :pTwo hot guys? Hmm...I remember seeing to business casually dressed men entering the corner table near us but I don't think their hot though. :/

Didn't they just get a new head chef there? One of the guys that was on the food network the next iron chef show? It definitely sounds like your restaurant week experience match some of my own, where the company exceeds the food. But hey, when the company is good, I don't mind.also, you and kathy in the comments are hilarious. haha, you didn't think they were hot.

I just wanted to chime in and say that I DIDN'T NOTICE ANY HOT GUYS...Oh, Kathy.  (pat pat)  :)I would've liked my beef dish more if it were, say, three times larger.  Bwahaaha.  (Actually the portion size of the whole meal was fine.  But still.  BEEEF!!)

Your experiences during RW seemed to mirror mine to a certain degree, ranging from overall underwhelming to deeply disappointing. With such high expectations for some of these restaurant, sometimes plain, old \"good\" just won't cut it.You can read some of my reviews of RW at:

A Ladies' Lunch at Devi (Winter Restaurant Week 2008) & Espresso

I kicked off Restaurant Week (back on Tuesday, January 22nd) with lunch with my three girl friends: Giulia, Seungmi, and Helen, at Devi. Yep, we're exploring into realm of haute Indian cuisine since what we've encounter in our pasts were heavy, greasy, fire breathing-spicy Indian food. We had high hopes for this place since I've heard a lot about it on Chowhound. And yes, I do acknowledge the fact that they do serve a prix fixe lunch on a normal basis but we craved Indian food.InteriorWe all went into this moderately dim restaurant with cool lamps strewn at the front of the dining room with accents of Asian eclectic furnishings. Not kitschy like some ethnic restaurants would decorate. We were escorted toward the back of the restaurant, not too far from the kitchen since we see many chefs go back and forth right behind the wall just mere feet away from our table.Once we settled in, we perused the Devi Winter RW ‘08 Lunch Menu and ordered our food.Giulia had Mom's bread roll fritters since she loves bread and it's interesting how they would fry bread and stuff it. When I tasted a bite, it was intriguing - the bread's soft with bits of potato and the cilantro, chili, and garam masala flavors moderately permeated my palate. The tomato sauce that accompanied the bread fritter was tasty, too - a hint of sweet-tart flavor.Salmon & Crab CroquettesHelen and Seungmi ordered the salmon and crab croquettes. These croquettes are not the typical stuff you would get in a Spanish tapas bar; they're denser and packed with a ton of meat (or I should say seafood). The aren't very crisp but the salmon and crab meat were very moist and tender. The pickled green chile mayonnaise was a tasty condiment to go with the croquette, that Helen doesn't mind smearing every last drop off her plate.Manchurian CauliflowerI got myself the Manchurian cauliflower since I remember reading on Chowhound that it's considered the signature dish or at least it's one of the highly recommended dishes to get here. And they didn't steer me wrong; the cauliflower ROCKED! The spicy garlic-infused tomato sauce was delicious with the fried, sweet cauliflower. I think it's the sauce that won me over - it's sweet, spicy but not a throat burning scorcher, and it's garlic-y.Lamb-stuffed Tandoori Chicken & InnardsA Plate of Mushroom ToastsClose upWhat was really unexpected was the fact that our servers brought out these two extra dishes to our table. And they said, \"They're compliments from the chef.\" This struck us as odd since we haven't complained about anything and I don't know the chef, yet we're being treated pretty well already.The lamb-stuffed chicken was an intriguing take with a chicken dish. The lamb was moist and tender with hints of cumin, fennel, and cilantro, while the chicken wasn't dry at all. The sauce that accompanied this dish was delicious as well - sweet, tart and savory all at the same time.The mushroom toasts were basically toast rounds topped with finely chopped mushrooms, flavored with cilantro and other spices that I don't really know (since I'm not too familiar with Indian cuisine). What appealed to me was the dainty size of these toasts that I thought it's adorable.WARM NAAN!!When the server brought out the basket of naan, my first instinct was to touch it to feel if it's warm. And it was! This elicited peals of giddiness from us, especially me since I am easily swooned with fresh bread of any type.Then the servers also brought out another dish on the house, a large platter of fried okra salad. Honestly, this is the first time I've ever tried okra. Since it's fried, I don't see any reason why I should not like it - I do like the fats. Anyways, the okra's really crispy and with the red onions and juicy tomato gave it some texture complexity; while my tongue was sensing a lot of coriander and cumin beyond those vegetables (and fruit from the tomato).Giulia's goat cheese pesto-stuffed chicken was yummy. What really enticed her to order it was due to her love of goat cheese. Yeah, goat cheese is awesome... Moving on, the chicken was a tad drier than I would like it to be but I like the flavor components of the soft tangy, creamy goat cheese with the herbal kick from the pesto.Helen's Bombay-style tandoori halibut was cooked perfectly. The halibut was moist and flavorful from the mint-cilantro chutney marinade. It's mildly spicy and I loved the coconut sauce on the side of her fish. It's nutty and creamy that cools down the heat factor by a notch.Seungmi's paneer stir-fry was something we haven't really tried or know since I personally never tried it. When she ordered this, she asked the waiter, \"What is paneer?\" What he defined it as, \"Something that tastes like fresh tofu.\" When we all got to try it, it does tastes like tofu even though it's technically not. It's slightly sweet and spicy with the mixture of peppers, onions, and cilantro. It almost tastes like a stir-fry that my parents could make at home though sans the cilantro. But tasty nevertheless.Then we finally come to my tandoor grilled lamb chops. This was a fantastic lamb dish. The lamb was cooked perfectly to a medium-rare; soft, tender and juicy, not at all gamy in terms with flavor. I really enjoyed the sweet and sour pear chutney the most (same with Giulia) since the pear wasn't mushy and it had the right balance of sweet, tart and spicy. The spiced potatoes were fine - it's mashed potatoes flavored with cumin, curry and cilantro.Despite the fact that all of us are sitting back on our chairs, trying our hardest to have room for dessert, we felt really full. But we must eat dessert. No dessert means (in my world) that the meal isn't completely done. So we went on full steam ahead and ordered.Everyone but Giulia ordered the kulfi which is an Indian ice cream, with candied pistachio, some kind of yellow noodle (which I don't remember its name) and citrus soup. I was expecting the ice cream to be soft but this is not the typical ice cream that we're all familiar of - it's chewier. It's a bit too cold that we're all struggling to dig in with our spoons but it's a dessert that I enjoy eating since it's not too sweet and it's delicately nutty flavored. The soup didn't taste citrusy even though the menu indicated it is - it's a sweet, milky soup.Then we go to Giulia's dessert, the lemon trio: lemon cake, lemon-lemongrass sorbet, and lemon curd. When I had a small bite of her dessert, it's quite refreshing as a pleasantly, acidic, sweet palate cleanser to the end of the meal. The cake was just moist enough with the curd to give a hint of lemon flavor, and the sorbet was creamy and smooth. It's a lovely simple dessert.Once we're all done with our desserts, we lingered here a bit longer for the sake of taking photos (since Helen loves playing with my camera) and we need to digest our food a bit since there were unexpected yet greatly appreciated extras to our meal. So, here's a few photos of us...Helen & SeungmiGiulia & IWe asked for the check and we walked outside. The strange thing to note was that while all of us were waiting for Seungmi to get out of the restaurant, we met one of the chef-owners of Devi, Suvir Saran and shook hands with me since he asked nicely which one of us was with the camera. (Jeebus, I'm getting attention without trying...) He inquired us how if we enjoyed the meal (which we did and they exceeded everything in terms of food and attentive service) and chatted briefly, and said our goodbyes. He went into his restaurant while we all wandered around Union Square window shopping.That's until I had an espresso craving, which Giulia won't mind having some as well. We all then walked over to Everyman Espresso (which used to be Ninth Street Espresso) since I haven't been there since they changed owners.Everyman Espresso's MenuSingle Origin of the MonthMy cappuccinoGiulia did order an espresso shot of the singe origin of the month, the Ethiopian Biloya, while I ordered the cappuccino. Despite the fact I forgot to take a photo of Giulia's espresso, I took a tiny sip from her demitasse cup. It's very strong and bold; initially I got the lush berry flavor then it peaked to a strong acerbic flavor and then dissipated to a nutty and almost chocolatey aftertaste. Me likey.My cappuccino was quite good but not exactly as complex as the straight up espresso Giulia had. The cappuccino was bold and silky with nutty undertones that's slightly muted with the creamy milk foam that topped this drink. I liked it a lot.This wrapped up our afternoon of delicious Indian fare, espresso drinks, and a great time with friends who I haven't seen in ages. Hopefully, tomorrow or by this weekend I'll post up my Restaurant Week lunch at Cafe Boulud - which I think a lot of you have seen my Flickr photos already on the sidebar.Addresses: Devi 8 E 18th Street New York, NY 10003Everyman Espresso 136 E 13th Street New York, NY 10003

Oh man your post made my mouth water. I had lunch at Devi awhile back and had the manchurian cauliflower and the lamb chops - both rocked my socks.

John: Ah, thanks! :)  Devi's cauliflower and lamb chops are ridiculously delicious. I wish I could eat that once a week...except my parents aren't too fond of lamb for some reason so I can't cook it at home.

Paneer is actually cheese; though, that's pretty hard to discern since, as you noted, it has the consistency of tofu.This place looks awesome, though!  Must try it out one day.

The yellow noodly thing is called sewai, semolina noodles, I think. Manchurian Cauliflower is killer funny, Punjabi Chinese. Paneer is cottage cheese.

As most of you who are familiar with my blog, I tend to eat...well. Ok, more than well I eat freakin' extravagant. Like any normal human being, I need a break from all this luxurious, fatty foods and need some simple yet tasty grub that isn't from my kitchen (just because I feel lazy from cooking my own food).Since I made an old promise to one of my friends, Julie that we would drink Mud's coffee (nearly a year ago) and I have time during the morning before an afternoon concert, we set the date and meet up late morning. With Ariel of course. When isn't he in the picture?I've heard that Mud's coffee is strong and dark like \"mud.\" Since I do like my coffee strong, and I do drink espresso straight (and yes, no sugar), I had somewhat of a high expectation of getting a good cup o' joe.Ariel, Julie and I all met inside Mud since it's freezing the past Saturday (1/19) morning and Ariel had the cold (again). What surprised me was that the place was really dim, especially when we got seated in the back. Julie commented that it's dark enough for her to go back to sleep. Ariel said that the decor looked so funky and hipster-like that he would've hung out here if he was in his college days. As for me, I don't mind the decor but the music was a notch or two louder than I would like but at least it was upbeat that Ariel had an urge to dance in his seat.When we perused the menu, we're just interested in the coffee since we're getting lunch somewhere else. Even though it should have been ordered but we all digressed from the signature Mud coffee and went for their espresso based drinks instead. Ariel and Julie ordered the mocha and I had the cappuccino.Mocha & CappuccinoWhat Ariel said about the mocha was that it's milky. Julie agreed. He commented on that if he was in his healthy state, he \"would have been pissed.\" But since he's sick, he doesn't mind. Actually he enjoyed it.As for my cappuccino, the first thing I noticed was the huge mug and it's frothy. Cappuccino isn't supposed to be this big nor this bubbly. When I attempted my first sip, all I really got was the milk foam not much in terms of the actual espresso until I took a gulp. This is not my cup of coffee. I would think of this as coffee flavored milk with extra foam. *Sighs* At least I know what Mud's espresso based drinks are like.Our destination for sustenance was a hot bowl of ramen. You might be wondering why would I eat there? Well, I watched the movie, Tampopo that Ariel touted as a great foodie movie that I would love. I watched the whole thing we loved the first scene and will reenact (Just keep reading to get to the clip.). Also, it's suitable since Ariel's illness harks a need for a bowl of soup (technically broth for ramen) and it's freezing out there. So where better than the much hyped ramen place over the past summer, Ramen Setagaya.Ramen time!Looking toward the kitchenAs we all perused the limited menu of shio ramen (with or without pork and if you want a regular or large serving) with five or so side dishes. We all decided on having the same thing, char siu ramen. Ariel just thrown in a side dish of salted egg since he saw the table behind us had a bunch of them.Ariel's salted eggI didn't bother trying Ariel's egg since I've eaten quite a number of them over the years since my family's Chinese and we make our own salted eggs if we wanted to. Also just eating salted egg without rice or anything is a bit odd to me since my tongue would be scream for WATER or RICE, just to dilute the salinity of the ovum. Going back to Ariel's feedback on his egg, he liked it a lot - not too salty and cooked properly.Mmmm...Bowl of comfortNoodsI don't know about you, but soup noodles of any kind scream comfort food to me. Something about eating (and slurping) noodles in a hot broth makes me feel so much better. It's magic I tell you! Magic! Anyways, the huge bowl of ramen that we all gotten was filled with fresh, thin ramen topped with four slices of roasted then grilled pork, half a salted egg (hence Ariel's slightly wasted expense earlier), mushrooms, and some kind of seasoning on top that I don't know the name of. I liked the ramen since it's not too chewy, the pork was lean and the mushrooms were chewy and gave a delicate hint of earthiness to the noodles. But the broth was way too salty for me that my palate is preventing me from finishing the broth. At least Ariel finished everything and drank every last drop of the broth. Julie ate everything but drank about half the broth.Going back to the Tampopo scene I was talking about earlier, Ariel and I supposed to reenact it. Since I took a long time taking photos, he went on doing it silently. What I mean was that he asked the question, \"Who would apologize [to the pork] with me?\" (Just watch the clip below). I said, \"I would if I wasn't busy taking photos.\" But he proceeded and happily ate his ramen.[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XyoAZFREnY&rel=1]After getting a full belly of ramen, Julie left us since she had to go to work at her sister's place and Ariel and I went uptown for the Lincoln Center matinée. Yes. I like classical music, ok?Post-concert, we wandered around the Upper West Side since Ariel wanted to check out if Cloverfield is playing in the nearby IMAX theater. After he got his ticket, I had a chocolate craving and thought of Levain's intense chocolate chip cookie, so we walked up further on Amsterdam. However, since we saw Jacques Torres' new outpost, we went in.Jacques TorresInteriorBeing tempted from all things chocolate, what appealed to us were the pastries and the remaining slice of banana chocolate dacquiose. For some reason, Ariel inquired the woman behind the counter, what's tastier the caramel or blueberry tart or the dacquiose? The woman replied, the dacquoise; \"hands down.\" So that's what we got and split it between us since we're still stuffed from the ramen we consumed hours earlier.Chocolate Banana DacquoiseThe dacquoise was pretty good. The light, banana flavored meringue encased the plain, dark chocolate (60% cacao content) ganache. Ariel said this cake was good but \"homespun.\" The latter referring to its flavor combination.After finishing our dessert, we went our own ways - I went home and he went back to the movie theaters to watch his movie.Addresses: Mud 307 E 9th Street New York, NY 10003Ramen Setagaya 141 1st Avenue New York, NY 10003Jacques Torres 285 Amsterdam Avenue New York, NY 10023

I had a latte from the Mud truck downtown and it was definitely on the milky side.  Tasted kinda like a hot milky yoohoo :(Setagaya is yummy.  You might prefer the char shu broth over at Minca since its a little less salty.  Caffe Emilia (next door to Setagaya) is one my favorite places.  Would love to see you take some pics of their stuff.

The eggs served at Setagaya weren't salted eggs!  They are Japanese style boiled eggs called \"hot spring\" egg (onsen tamago).  They are boiled and the egg yolks come out a bit on the runny side.  They surely should not taste salty!

Dennis: Setagaya is tasty! I need to try more ramen places like Minca and others.Ooooh...Caffe Emilia's menu sounds tempting. I have to go there soon!Marge: I dunno...I tasted salt in the egg. Not an explosive hit of sodium on my tongue but more like a gentle zing. It's not runny per se; it's like soft-boiled egg that's been sitting on the counter for a while that the yolk settled.

I was about to say that the broth at Minca is salty up the wazoo, but then I read Dennis's comment...ooops.  ;)  I could be wrong; I just remember loving Minca and its salty porktastic bowl of...awesome.  (That's my favorite ramen shop so far.)As for an onsen egg, I still remember the one from Momofuku in their namesake noodle bowl.  Oh my god.  So tasty.  I remember the non-noodle parts of the dish much more than the noodles, haha.

Lunch with Two Exec Chefs at Jean Georges

***CONTENT
The most unimaginable thing happened to me for on Thursday: eating lunch with two executive chefs at Jean Georges.Just to give you the gist on how this event to ever occur, Marc Collins of Circa 1886 in Charleston, SC, emailed me for a bunch of recommendations to eat out around Manhattan since he's cooking at the James Beard Foundation for the Tastes of Charleston event. We emailed each other for a good number of times and in the end, he asked me to join him for lunch at JG with his best friend, Kyle Ketchum of the Spiced Pear in Newport, RI. When I got this invitation I was thinking, \"Huh?! Me, an insignificant food blogger having lunch with executive chefs? Have they gone mad?!\" No, I don't think they're crazy; only me. (I should clarify this now that I paid my own lunch).We've met outside at Jean Georges and went in to check our stuff. We waited several minutes at the desk for our table to be ready. During our wait, we chatted about their dinner at Momofuku Ssäm and a briefly about myself.When our table was ready and walked through Nougatine, the casual portion of JG, we all saw Jean Georges himself in the kitchen. This particular moment was poignant since anyone who have ever heard of Jean Georges, he has sixteen restaurants internationally. Obviously, it's a rare sight to see him in the kitchen. When all three of us got seated, Marc and Kyle started to debate whether or not they should ask for a tour of the kitchen. But the subject got dropped once our waitress started to ask what we like to order.The dining roomThe Winter MenuBread's being served & A slice of sourdoughAfter we ordered, we're served with the usual bread and butter. The sourdough bread was notably sour. What Kyle had noted was that the butter was slightly tart as well.While we waited for our first course, we talked about more in depth about where they ate in Manhattan. What struck me the most was when they told me they went to Eleven Madison Park twice. As in back-to-back days for dinner and lunch. That's how much they love that place. The comment they made about EMP was that \"their food tastes as good as it looks [on their website and in person].\"Then our amuse bouche has arrived.The Amuse Bouche with a few close up shotsThe shot glass is filled with artichoke soup with cranberry foam. This soup was very good: the mild artichoke flavor, warm, smooth and creamy with a touch of tart and lightness from the cranberries. Somehow from the amuse bouches I've eaten here, their soup have been pretty spectacular.The shiitake mushroom was meaty, potent, and earthy contrasted with the acidic bite of the gelée. The crunchiness is from the thin toasted rye bread which gives it some substance to the chew. It's wonderful.The fresh, silky salmon belly was flavored with a splash of chili vinaigrette, giving it a tart, spicy kick. The most notable part was eating it with the herb (I don't know its name) that topped this salmon - it was bracing with a sharp herbal flavor. It's good but not as great as the other amuses.Moving on to our first courses:The Foie Gras BrûléeThe foie gras brûlée was Kyle's first course. Since we all ordered our own foie, I didn't taste his only take a photo of it. I'll explain this dish when you get to mine.Sea Scallops, Caramelized Cauliflower, Caper-Raisin EmulsionThe sea scallops were Marc's. The sea scallop was seared perfectly. A thin, slightly crisp crust meets the sweet, meaty scallop with an extra punch of sweetness and crunch with the cauliflower. The capers was quite potent on the sauce, as both chefs have noted.Bluefin Tuna Ribbons, Avocado, Spicy Radish, Ginger MarinadeMy tuna dish attracted a bit of attention from the chefs was due to its presentation: thick strands of tuna, twirled and piled like it was spaghetti. It just boggled their minds how the kitchen actually pull it off. In terms of taste, this was a winner. The tuna was fresh and meaty, flavored with a potent ginger marinade. The avocado almost made me think I was eating wasabi since it absorbed the marinade and the chili-flecked radishes brought crunchiness to the party. We all liked this dish the most in this round.Pouring the consomméKyle's halibut steamed with honshimeji mushrooms and lemon grass consommé was very bright and citrusy. His main reason to order this dish was to try the consommé, which I thought was bland compared to the fish. The halibut was meaty, moist, and intensely bright from all that lemon and other citrus fruits' zest embedded with the delicately earthy mushrooms.Marc's second course was the foie gras. Still looks as great as Kyle's...but I'm still not going to talk about it until we get to mine.Finally, our last savory course.Parmesan Crusted Confit Leg of Chicken, Salsify, Basil and Lemon ButterMarc's parmesan crusted confit leg of chicken was tender and moist with a crisp top. The salsify was sweet (in a savory, vegetal way), tart and tender. It's a good chicken dish but I'm not reaching some kind of epiphany. Since Marc and Kyle are chefs, they've actually tried to figure out how did the kitchen pull out a dish like this (e.g. discussing cooking techniques, etc.). Interesting to listen. From what I can remember, they said that confitting the chicken saved it from drying it out when it's pressed flat and getting that crunchy exterior.Tangy Glazed Short Ribs, Crunchy Grits and Herb SaladKyle's short rib was hearty, a bit sweet, with a melt-in-your-mouth texture, and generously portioned. The crunchy grits was the item that looked similar to an egg roll. What he said that it's too sweet to be savory that he would daresay that he's eating dessert. This dish tided him over to a food coma. Strangely, what Marc told me was when they ate at Per Se the other night (and ate about fourteen courses), Marc was dying halfway their dinner, while Kyle actually was doing fine and kept on going. But Kyle did admitted to me later that red meat makes him sleepy.And here's what you've been waiting for:Foie Gras Brûlée, Dried Sour Cherries, Candied Pistachios and White Port GeléeThe foie gras brûlée topped with dried sour cherries, candied pistachios and sitting on a bed of white port gelée. I would say that this would be almost perfection on a plate. Almost. The smooth, luscious foie gras meets the sweet, crunchy roasted pistachios. The tart, slightly chewy, dried cherries with a touch of toasted bread that's under the foie. All of that is hit with a punch of acidity from the gelée to lighten the dense flavor of the foie. If this was served warm (as both chefs have mentioned) it would take this dish to another level - to the most divine foie dish. We can almost taste it.Crashing down from our food elations, we sat out a bit and talked about our lunch a bit before the waiter gave us the dessert menu.Dessert menuKyle was still in his food coma, yawning every now and then, not really wanting to eat another bite of food. But he was intrigued by the flavors and the elements in several desserts. For now, he didn't order any dessert. Marc and I have chosen our own desserts.Marc's dessert, \"Winter,\" was good. The gingerbread was nicely spiced, not too sweet and the pumpkin mousse was light with some substance from not being too airy and its flavors. I haven't tried the crisp but generally, I wasn't too amazed with this dessert. The pomegranate sorbet was suprisingly subtle. I was expecting an intense tart pomegranate flavor but it's very subdued. But it was very smooth, almost creamy like an ice cream.Pomegranate SorbetMultiple views of the Gingerbread SpongeI had the \"Citrus\" dessert. What attracted me to this dessert was the use of jicama. The jicama noodles actually reminded me of cellophane noodles texturally for being slightly chewy and color-wise (or lack of). It's intensely flavored with the citrusy flavors of the kaffir lime, tangerine and limoncello gratinee. The chocolate poppy seed cake was a bit dry since it's so tiny and the Meyer lemon curd that topped that cake was a bit too stiff for my liking. The halva powder was an interesting crunchy component.\"Citrus\" dessertPlopping some granitee & Chocolate Poppy Seed CakeAfter seeing our desserts, Kyle changed his mind and ordered the \"Apple\" dessert. He said that he's ordering it for the sake of seeing it. His dessert was a bit unbalanced. The apple confit, pine nut sponge, and smoked raisin was way too smoky - most prominently from the brûléed top, rendering the apples to taste bland. The tamarind ice cream was creamy and richly spiced. I haven't tasted the Granny-Smith fennel sorbet but from their reactions, it seemed to be a bit mixed.\"Apple\" Dessert and the Apple Confit, Pine Nut SpongeThen the usual way for Jean Georges to end the meal in style, the petit fours with the usual ceremonial marshmallow cutting, the plate of microscopic macarons and the tray of chocolates.Ceremonial cutting of marshmallowsPlate of marshmallowsChocolates!The micro macaronsThe marshmallows are soft but I don't really care for them that much. Of the three flavors (cinnamon, Meyer lemon and vanilla) offered, cinnamon was the best. The chocolates were very delicious - dark chocolate, around 65% cocoa content filled with various fillings. From what I can remembered that was served was chamomile, cappuccino, Bergamot, chai, and others. I was too stuffed to go beyond two bonbons. And the macarons (poppy seed, vanilla, and chocolate), as much as they are adorable, are still dry and chewy.It was a very good lunch (and long since it was a two-hour lunch) nevertheless. Great service, delicious food (some better than others), and the company was great as well.What topped this lunch was the fact that Marc and Kyle really thought about going to the kitchen and take a look at it since it was 4 PM. We slowly walked toward the back, saw Chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten talking to one of his chefs and admire the tiny kitchen. He saw us standing a few feet away him, managed to step out of the kitchen, gave us a firm handshake and asked a few questions, mainly to Marc and Kyle. I have nothing to say since I was celebrity chef-struck that I'm speechless except saying \"Hi,\" \"Thank you,\" and \"Bye.\"The kitchenHe's here!Once we got our coats and bags from the coat check, we bid farewell to each other as Kyle has to go back to Rhode Island and Marc's leaving the city several hours later. It's been one heck of an afternoon that I'll never regret.If you want to see the slideshow of the entire lunch, click here.Address: Jean Georges 1 Central Park W New York, NY 10023

OMG OMG OMG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!alright, that was my initial reaction to the title of this post.
Can I tell you how much I appreciate Jean George Vonrichten for elevating chinese cuisine to haute cusine in America? Americans have so little appreciation for China's culinary history (arguably one of the greatest in the world, althoug I'm obviously biased), and think chinese food is about *beef and brocolli* or god forbi crab rangoon. While J. G. V isn't exactly all about the great traditiona dishes of China, at least he can get people interested enough to look beyond their local takeout joint. I kind of see that happening already, just not enough yet for me.okay, enough rambling, back to readin' :D

What an exciting experience Tina. I am so happy for you. or jealous, or happy, or jealous...I have only been to JG once and I had the foie dish you had. I remember liking it but the richness made me sick after a few bites so I had to pass the rest to my eager boyfriend. My one observation about the desserts there is that they dont taste as good as they look. The flavor combination and presentation is intriguing but the taste is disappointing. Except for the signature molten chocolate cake, which was divine. I think we had the citrus and chocolate dessert.

roze: Yes, I agree that I'm lucky to shake hands with a culinary god. I'm still in shock...Thanks!Danny: It was an exquisite meal! I can't believe chefs actually read my blog!Wendy: Well, my emotions were swinging from confusion to happiness. Any foie gras of sort is a decadent dish that's why it's generally a small portion in comparison to what I had at WD-50 last time.In terms with desserts, what I had when I ate there last time with a friend of mine, the desserts were pretty darn amazing. I guess it's a hit-or-miss in terms with the seasons or something.

An Early Morning Duty...

It's just one of those mornings when I have to get up at 4:30 AM and start cranking out breakfast. I know it's an insane time for most of you to get up that early but if you have a demanding mother who requests you to bake this as the last home baked breakfast for your younger brother before he goes back to college, you have to do it. Trust me. Living with a mom who can start World War III for the smallest things isn't worth the fight.Are you worth my sleep time?So, I started prepping my usual go-to bread, my variation of Rose Levy Beranbaum's cinnamon raisin loaf, the night before. (What I've altered from her recipe was replacing the cinnamon spiral with sweetened, flaked coconut, soaked the raisins, and made the dough a bit sweeter). I shaped it, proofed it, and placed the loaves in the refrigerator overnight. Thankfully, my mom's willing to take out the loaves from the fridge around 3 AM since she's usually having her early morning food cravings.I popped these babies in the oven around 5. When the loaves are about three-fourths baked through, the entire house smells like toasted coconut. Besides the fact that it made me hungry, it woke up my sleepy-headed father who wouldn't normally wake up until 7:30.Hmmm...maybe you're ain't so bad after allInnardsAt least my efforts weren't wasted: my mom's happy about this loaf since she likes soft bread; my dad's happy just to eat fresh baked bread and my brother liked it because it's tasty. I'm just happy because everyone's happy with the food (I also baked a batch of cranberry orange muffins), have my morning cup of coffee, and GO TO SLEEP.The bread recipe is right after the jump.Coconut Raisin Loaf Adapted from the Cinnamon Raisin Loaf recipe from The Bread Bible by Rose Levy BeranbaumTime Schedule Dough Starter (Sponge): minimum of 1 hour, maximum of 24 hours Minimum Rising Time: about 3 1/2 hours Oven Temperature: 350 degrees F Baking Time: about 50 minutesMakes two 8 x 4 x 4.5-inch high loavesEquipment Two 8 1/2 x 4 1/2-inch loaf pans, lightly greased with cooking spray or oil A baking stone OR baking sheetDough Starter 2 1/4 cups plus 2 1/2 tablespoons unbleached all-purpose flour Scant 1 3/4 liquid cups room temperature water (70 to 90 degrees F) 2 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon honey 3 tablespoons granulated sugar 3/4 teaspoon instant yeast1. Make the sponge. In a mixer bowl or other large bowl, combine the flour, water, honey, and instant yeast. Whisk until very smooth to incorporate air, about 2 minutes. The sponge will be the consistency of a thick batter. Scrape down the sides of the bowl and cover it with plastic wrap.Flour Mixture and Dough Ingredients 2 cups plus 3 tablespoons unbleached all-purpose flour 1/4 cup dry milk, preferably nonfat 3/4 teaspoon instant yeast 8 tablespoons (1 stick) softened, unsalted butter 2 1/4 teaspoons saltRaisins 1 cup raisins, soaked in room temperature water with 3 drops of Cognac (for about 4 hours), then drained2. Combine the ingredients for the flour mixture and and to the sponge. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour (reserve a 1/4 cup if mixing by hand), dry milk, and instant yeast. Sprinkle this on top of the sponge and cover tightly with plastic wrap. Allow it to ferment for 1 to 4 hours at room temperature. (During this time the sponge will bubble through the flour blanket in places: this is fine.)3. Mix the dough Mixer Method Add the butter to the bowl and mix on low speed with the dough hook for 1 minute or until the flour is moistened enough to form a rough dough. Scrape down any bits of dough. Cover the top of the bowl with plastic and allow the dough to rest for 20 minutes.Sprinkle on the salt and knead the dough on medium speed for 7 to 10 minutes. It will not come away from the bowl until toward the last minute or so of kneading; it will be smooth and shiny and stick to your fingers. With an oiled spatula, scrape down any dough clinging to the sides of the bowl. If the dough is not stiff, knead in a little flour. If it is not at all sticky, spray it with a little water and knead it in. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and allow the dough to relax for 10 minutes.Add the raisins and mix on low speed for about 2 minutes to incorporate them evenly. But don't worry too much about how they will distribute, because deflating and folding the dough after the first rise will distribute them more evenly.Hand Method Add the salt and butter to the bowl and, with a wooden spoon or your hand, stir until all the flour is moistened. Knead the dough in the bowl until it comes together, then scrape it onto a lightly floured counter. Knead the dough for 5 minutes, enough to develop the gluten structure a little, adding as little of the reserved flour as possible to keep it from sticking. Use a bench scraper to scrape the dough and gather it together as you knead it. At this point, it will be very sticky. Cover it with the inverted bowl and allow it to rest for 20 minutes. (This resting time will make the dough less sticky and easier to work with.)Knead the dough for another 5 minutes or until it is very smooth and elastic. It should be still sticky enough to cling slightly to your fingers. If the dough is still very sticky, however, add some of the remaining reserved flour, or a little extra. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and allow the dough to relax for 10 minutes.Add the raisins and, with an oiled wooden spoon or your hand, mix in the raisins to incorporate them evenly. But don't worry too much about how well they distribute, because deflating and folding the dough after the first rise will distribute them more evenly.Both methods 5. Let the dough rise. Using an oiled spatula or dough scraper, scrape the dough into a 4-quart dough-rising container or bowl, lightly oiled with cooking spray or oil. Push down the dough and lightly spray or oil the surface. Cover the container with a lid or plastic wrap. With a piece of tape, mark the side of the container at approximately where double the height of the dough would be. Allow the dough to rise (ideally at 75 to 80 degrees F) until doubled, 1 1/2 to 2 hours.Using an oiled spatula or dough scraper, scrape the dough into a floured counter and press down on it gently to form a rectangle. It will be full of air and resilient. Try to maintain as many of the air bubbles as possible. Give the dough 1 business letter turn and set it back in the container. Oil the surface again, cover, and refrigerate for 1 hour to firm the dough for rollingCoconut Spiral Filling (Optional) 1/2 cup toasted, sweetened, flaked coconut (cooled) 1/4 cup un-toasted sweetened, flaked coconut Lightly beaten egg6. Make the optional coconut spiral filling. In a small bowl, mix both coconuts together.7. Shape the dough and let it rise. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured counter and cut it in half. Keep one piece of dough covered while you work with the other piece.To make raisin bread without the coconut spiral: Shape each piece into a loaf and place the dough in the prepared loaf pans; it will be about 1/2 inch from the top of the pans.To make a spiral bread: You may want to refrigerate half the dough so that you don't have to rush the shaping of the first piece.On a lightly floured counter, roll out one piece of dough to a rectangle 7 1/2 inches wide by 14 inches long and about 1/4 inch thick. Using your fingertips, gently dimple the dough all over to deflate air bubbles that result in gaps in the spiral. Brush the dough with the lightly beaten egg leaven a 3/4-inch margin all around.Sprinkle half the coconut mixture evenly over the dough, leaving a 3/4-inch margin on all sides. Starting from the short end closest to you, roll the dough up tightly, as you would a jelly roll; brush the top of the dough with egg and squeeze the dough gently all along the length of the roll with each roll so that it will adhere well to the filling. If necessary, use your hands to push in the ends of the roll so that it does not get larger than 7 1/2 inches long. When you come to the end, make a seam by tightly pinching the edge of the dough to seal the filling. Push in any inner coils of dough on the sides that may have worked their way out and pinch the ends of the dough tightly together to seal. Tuck them under so that the loaf will fit into the pan.Place the roll seam side down in a prepared pan; it will be about 1/2 inch form the top of the pan. Repeat for the second loaf.Cover the pans with a large container, or cover loosely with oiled plastic wrap. Allow to rise about 1 to 2 hours or until the center is 1 1/2 inches above the sides of the pan. When the dough is pressed lightly with your fingertip, the indentation will remain.8. Preheat the oven. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F 45 minutes before baking. Have an oven shelf at the lowest level and place a baking stone or baking sheet on it before preheating.9. Bake the bread. Quickly but gently set the pans on the hot baking stone or hot baking sheet, and immediately shut the door. Bake for 50 minutes or until the bread is medium golden brown and a skewer inserted in the middle comes out clean (an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center will read about 211 degrees F.) Halfway through baking, turn the pans around for even baking.10. Glaze and cool the bread. Remove the pans from the oven and set them on a wire rack. Unmold and cool top side up on a wire rack until barely warm, about 1 hour.

After all the proofing of the yeast, the dough doesn't seem to have  risen much.  Does it usually have more of a rise or, is it supposed to be a moderately risen bread?Also, on the Jacques Torres chocolate banana dacquoise.  Nice photo.  Have you sampled it?  If you have, is that a layer of chocolate-banana ganache?Hoping you will respond as soon as you can as I will be attempting to duplicating that one immediately.Thanks

Ugh, sorry about the spelling...that would be uh....duplicate.
thewanderingeater
2008-01-21 23:24:00
Cheryl: It should be risen a tad more since it the top layered \"shelled\" a bit (in other words the top layered is a bit loose). If I kept continuing on the recipe about the notes Ms. Beranbaum wrote, she said that if it did \"shell\" it's under-risen.Thanks in regards to the dacquoise photo. I have sampled it. It's just plain dark chocolate ganache with banana flavored cake.

Ah, Restaurant Week...so many choices (about 240, give or take) and within a time span of ten days. Lunch is $24.07 and dinner's $35, which is relatively inexpensive for the high end restaurants, especially in Manhattan. Since it's less than 1 1/2 weeks away, many ask readers ask me, \"Where should I eat?\" That's a good question. So here's my suggestions and expectations for the (in)famous Restaurant Week.Suggestions/TipsReservations are an almost absolute must for any hot restaurant. A few hot restaurants who are participating for the Winter 2008 would be: Eleven Madison Park, Gramercy Tavern, Union Square Cafe, and Nobu. The first three are all part of Danny Meyer's empire; they stand out mainly because the trademark service and hospitality and good food. Nobu is self-explanatory. If you haven't gotten a reservation by now, I would cross my fingers and hope there would be an opening for you.My suggestions that you should go to are: the aforementioned except Nobu since I've heard from many friends and foodies who went there that it's not so tasty and it's all about the scene; Del Posto, A Voce (I went there last winter and it's pretty good), Chanterelle, Cafe Boulud, and Anthos (I'm going to the latter two this month.). Others I heard was pretty good also was the Maze at the London Hotel, Butter and Perry St. I haven't been to the latter two but several Chowhounders have said they had good experiences there.ExpectationsAs I've mentioned earlier, reservations are almost a must and it has to be done a month (or 28 days) prior to the expected dining date. Sure, it's a pain in the neck but at least you don't have to suffer waiting a long time for a table (since it's packed with diners). Or you'll just give up waiting for a table and wander around the streets for something to eat before you want to pass out from starvation.Service tends to be spotty. Thousands (or millions?) of New Yorkers and tourists are aware of RW that they're all packing in the participating restaurants. Wait staff are frazzled by the large number of diners hence the lack of attention that a diner would want, unless you have the whole afternoon or evening to casually eat at your own pace.Food. The most important thing to me more than service, decor, and ambiance. I do admit it's depends on which place you're eating (in other words do your homework and read reviews of places you're thinking of eating to), menus are limited (normally two choices per course, some places three) and how the kitchen's functioning that day.The latter is questionably the scariest answer anyone would ever want to face but it's true. For example, when I went to the Modern Bar Room the past summer for dinner, I had a good food experience while service was lacking. When I stated this on Chowhound, others dissented. But generally, restaurants do stick to their guns and do serve what it's expected.Summary of Past Dining RW Experiences During the times before I started writing, I've been to Fleur de Sel, Union Square Cafe, and Nougatine (the casual, slightly inexpensive spin-off of Jean Georges proper). All three were good but I find Union Square Cafe's food a bit...blah. What I mean by \"blah\" was that it's very ordinary, non-inventive food. But that's my opinion. There's a cult following who supported USC longer than my twenty-two years of existence on this planet who would beat me to the ground if I said that to their face.As of the past summer, when I actually document all of my RW outings (Aureole (twice, believe it or not), The Modern Bar Room, Aquavit Cafe, Eleven Madison Park, and Asiate. The least memorable was Eleven Madison Park. Since I had their Gourmand menu a month prior to the actual lunch during RW, it was really underwhelming but at least service was attentive (also being surrounded with good friends soften the blow of the average food). The better ones were Aquavit Cafe and the Modern Bar Room. But the Modern's service was a bit inattentive. Sure it was a Friday night but the wait service seemed almost inexistent and the dessert was a bit insipid.Hopefully, this addresses most of your questions about New York City's Restaurant Week. If not, drop a line on the comments.

Great post! I would also caution people not to dine at places that have an inexpensive prix fixed menu year-round.Also, I'd mention that you often can't reserve RW tables on Opentable, as the restaurant will hold back those tables. You'll need to get on speed dial the moment their books open for the date you want.Nobu and USC aren't bad restaurants per se, just that they have menus that haven't changed in years (or decades). What once was new and exciting us now old hat. And nowadays every Japanese place in town is serving Nobu's signature dishes!

do you think it is a worthwhile experience? i tend to get the feeling from nymag and eater that those publications hate on RW since the food options are so limited. I admit, it is a lot of fun to get a group of friends together and have an excuse to go to a restaurant that we would not normally visit.

Kathryn: Thanks! Yes, I totally forgotten to mention those two important facts!Danny: Hmm...after eating RW for the past three years, it ain't too bad. Most tend to be good and a few are mediocre experiences.Food options are limited, so if you're really interested in a certain restaurant, just email them and ask for a copy of their menu so you'll know if they have want you want to eat. And yes, RW is my excuse to eat out with a bunch of friends who I haven't seen in a long while as well.

UPDATE (1/9/08): Ok, I haven't been to the supposed awesome restaurant (that's Babbo, btw) last weekend due to family reasons. Everything is fine. I'm ok. My family's ok. It's just one of my uncles had broken his arm and my relatives freaked out over the phone and it snowballed as it went on. So, I had to cancel and postpone this long awaited dinner at Babbo. My efforts of obtaining a darn reservation for this place was wasted but I would do it again sometime in the near future. I'm terribly sorry for those of you who are waiting (eternity it seems like to some of you) for a real post. Alas, I don't really have one yet.I started writing about my best friend, Kim's post-Christmas, pre-New Year's party taken place in Long Beach, Long Island. But it turned out to be more non-food related more than food so, I scrapped all that was written and spare you all from the non-food stuff and just let you go through my slideshow of the photos taken during her awesome party. So you get a glimpse of what happened that day.Oooh...foodThere was lots, and I do mean lots of good food. No alcohol (thankfully) and good friends. There were jumping photos too, woot! And to shock a lot of people who know me, I danced. But thankfully, there wasn't any much evidence of my horrible skills that have been documented.I'm sorry I don't have much to tell you but I will write a restaurant experience soon, since this weekend I'm planning to go an awesome place. Just be patient with me, as most of you are with my irregular times of updating.WE'RE JUMPIN'!

On Friday, I managed to get myself out of bed and my house in this dreadfully cold, white, and snowy morning. When I heard that it's going to snow for the past several days, I was thinking it's just an inch or two, no biggie. Except when I stepped out of my door it looked like this...LOTS OF SNOW!As I trudged myself through the now slushy sidewalks of Manhattan to work, I almost felt inclined to cancel my dinner with Ariel at Merkato 55. Except I didn't just because I don't want to suffer another uneventful weekend at home, so I called him around lunchtime and confirmed our dinner and other activities that I will explain later.Partial view of the 2nd floorAs we were seated on the second floor, this spacious, dark wooden paneled floors with an African theme (colonial maps and portraits) looks a bit - \"Disney-fied.\" The diners among us are the usual Meatpacking District crowd - women wearing teetering, stiletto heels who are going to drink and dance the night away, Europeans, young couples, and people like Ariel and I, who are trying out this place out of curiosity since there's so much press about this place.The MenuBeing the indecisive people that we are, we took nearly ten minutes deciding what to try out in the Kidogo section of the menu. Since there's foie gras chutney and Ariel's a foie gras lovin' kind of guy, it's a default for us to try that. I'm always up for innards, so I wanted to try the dullet spiced tripe. We thrown in the African breads since it's different than the typical bread we eat, after asking our waitress what's in this particular bread basket.Dullet Spiced TripeThe Dullet Spiced Tripe was considered a special on the Kidogo menu, but I was hesitant that the $10 price tag would justify a pretty small portion. But it's delicious - spicy, tender chunks of tripe, leaving a slight warmth on the palate. I just wish there was more of it.The foie gras chutney was mixed in with chunks of dried figs and served with a few slices of pita bread. As much as I love foie gras, I don't exactly love since I thought the figs were a bit too sweet for the foie but it gave it an interesting chewy, crunchy texture.The African Breads and a few on my plateAs for the small pot of African bread, we were served two of each - the Benne and the Za'tar, and a single chunk of Meali. The Benne bread had a nutty, buttery scent since it's slathered with melted butter. The Za'tar which basically a white bread brushed with melted butter and sprinkled densely with za'tar was fine. Nothing exactly remarkable about it but it tasted good. Ariel just prefer this particular carb just because he's familiar with the spices. And finally, the Meali was a savory-sweet cornbread with little nuances of a certain pepper...which I can't really recall but I remember seeing flecks of red and green floating around. It's good as well but it doesn't exactly scream \"African\" to me.OystersThe oysters with harissa mignonette and melon granite was quite delicious. My hesitancy to say it's the best oyster on the half shell it's because the mignonette was quite subdued. The cold, slightly sweet, melon granite took over the silky texture and delicate flavors of the oyster. As Ariel had told me when he tried it, \"It's too icy.\" which I agree.Grilled Piri Piri ShrimpThe grilled piri piri shrimp with baby Romaine lettuce was quite good. We were served three huge, sweet prawns slathered in a tasty, mildly spicy sauce that is meant to get your hands dirty for. The large head of the shrimp was a bit of a task to suck out its contents but it's worth the effort.A Pot o' Dark Meat and Injera BreadI wanted to try the chicken doro wat mainly because I've read from NY Magazine about this particular dish, despite the fact that Ariel questioned me why on Earth would I order chicken stew? Is it worth it's time on the spotlight? Well, I do have to say this stewed chicken was somewhat interesting. It's something about having slightly spicy chicken being served with cottage cheese (that's the white splotches on the photo) as part of the sauce. It gave it a tang and creaminess to the dish. The chicken (a thigh and drumstick served) was cooked 'til it's fork tender and melts in my mouth. The injera bread wasn't as tangy as I expected. The tang is more like a subtle aftertaste rather than something very brusque and in your face.After finishing our chicken and the plates were cleared, our waitress asked us if we wanted dessert? We took a look at the menu and Ariel's interested in the avocado shake. I didn't really want to eat dessert (I know - it's a shocker), just because I felt full. Ariel chimed in, \"Just pick a dessert. I'll help you out. \" Despite my resistance, I picked an African inspired flavored donut.The 'cado shake pour and afterAriel's avocado shake was presented originally as a glass filled with a creamy, white blob of coconut. Then the server emptied out the contents from a short stainless steel vessel, showing the viscous, lime green puree of avocado. Since I was intrigued by how this shake taste like (and I never drank an avocado shake before), I grabbed my spoon, stirred the contents slightly and got myself a heaping spoon. It was delicious - cool, creamy, coconutty with a hint of avocado flavor and lime? I detected something citrusy on the background when I thought about the flavors on my tongue. Now I know what I'm missing out, after reading Robyn's multiple posts about her love for avocado shakes.Baby donuts and dipping sauceAs for my donuts (which I forgot the African name they dubbed this concoction), it's not bad. The little donuts were warm, filled with creamy, coconutty custard, tossed in a sugary coating. The citrus dip that accompanied it contrasted out the nuttiness of the coconut. It's not cloyingly sweet and it's quite light. The problem was the fact that they're a bit soggy and it doesn't exactly tell my palate that these fried balls of sweet dough are African influenced.We asked for the check and left the restaurant a little past 8 PM. Strangely, this place wasn't as packed as we expect any Meatpacking District place would be on a Friday night. But since it did snow and at that time - chilly and drizzling - probably it wasn't the best time to go out. However, we went on with the planned activities and walked all the way to the Lower East Side to Crash Mansion. Yes, somehow I felt inclined to go out clubbing that day, which was a rarity in itself.After walking over there, the bouncer told us that we're too early for our particular party since I was on a specified list. So, Ariel and I just wandered around the Lower East Side. As we walked out west, Ariel stopped near a steam pipe and was amused by the steady stream of hot air puffing out of that pipe. I paused and thought about what he's talking about and we thought about the old noir films - the mysteriousness of the fog; we took a few photos, as you'll see below, and had a kick out of it.Oooh...steamEventually we went over to Allen Street and came across this humorous sign that's nearby People Lounge & Restaurant, then we entered in.Ariel chose this place because he heard of it before. As for my knowledge, I never heard of this place except for its next door neighbor Rayuela. But I'm willing to try their drinks anyway.Interior & the cocktail menuCrowded with mostly the younger college-aged kids throwing their party, a smaller, quieter party nearby them, and the loud party blasting the music upstairs, this lounge/restaurant doesn't exactly make me feel like I want to hang around here. Also, there wasn't much to look at. As most of you might know, I'm not a drinker just because my alcohol tolerance is so low that once I'm past two drinks, I'm out for the night. But since Ariel already ordered a drink and said to the bartender, \"The lady would like...\" that cue left me no choice but to pick a drink that seems interesting.Our drinksAriel had the lychee mojito (on the right, in the photo) and I had the pomerita (on the left, in the photo). My drink somehow was stronger tasting with the booze factor than Ariel's, and his was more sweeter since there's lychee nectar in his drink.Yep, I'm at a club...After we finished our drinks, we walked back to Crash Mansion and got another round of drinks since it's an open vodka bar and listened to the band who's playing at that hour.Sound checkMORE BOOZE?!Unfortunately, I didn't catch the band's name since the head singer said it 100 mph! I did like their music though. Anyways, after bopping our heads and feet to the beat for an hour, the fun had to come to an end for me. Awwwww. I bid Ariel goodnight and I walked my slightly tipsy self into the subway station, passed out in the train ride home and eventually I got into my warm, cozy bed. Ah, sleep. How I love thee...Addresses: Merkato 55 55 Gansevoort Street New York, NY 10014People's Lounge & Restaurant 163 Allen Street New York, NY 10002

The doro wat dish is getting a lot of press. I wonder if people care for the rest of the stuff... The injera sounds good though, since a lot of times it seems too tangy.

Danny: I knew that for a while, hence my curiosity for this particular dish. I don't know about the latter. I mean, I heard a lot about their Kiddogo portion of the menu but all the food doesn't exactly scream African food to me - more like influenced.

I'm all the way in London, England. I have an abudance of restaurants to choose from, but have to experience them by myself. Being on my own plus taking pictures of the food must make me come across as a bit strange, ha ha.Next time I get the chance I'll remember to suck the heads!

I know I haven't written in ages, but it's just the fact that I haven't really found anything tasty around the Upper East Side that is new to me. Sure, there's Alice's Tea Cup and a few Le Pain Quotidiens around my area but seriously, why should I write repeats of myself? Yeah, I do admit I went overboard with Bouchon Bakery for a while, back in the days that I was at college in the Upper West Side, but now I learned my lesson from sounding so redundant (and obsessive).Anyways, last Thursday I managed to get my butt out of bed early for the sake of getting myself a decent or good cup of cappuccino. I do have my standby at Sicaffe but I want a change so I'm willing to schlep my half-sleepy self over to Gimme! Coffee in Nolita.Finally, a tasty capp.After paying and waiting less than a minute for my cup of cappuccino, I finally took my first sip of milk-froth, laced espresso. I loved every drop that I consumed - it's perfectly balanced: not too milky, not too bitter; with subtle fruity, acidic notes lingering on my palate.Happy and caffeinated, I thought to myself as I'm walking down Spring Street, \"Why not go to Balthazar Bakery for breakfast?\" I remember viewing Robyn's photo about their pastries recently, I craved their donut. I entered the small, packed bakery and got myself a pistachio donut to go since it's take-out only and I have to go to work in the Upper East Side in 15 minutes!Mmmm...DonutGetting in at work on time and settled down at my desk, I took out my breakfast and savored every morsel of this delicious pistachio donut. It's a cake donut, a light texture but has substance, topped with a sweet icing, topped with crunchy, chopped, roasted pistachios. Mmmm...if breakfast was like this every morning, I don't mind getting out of bed early for this breakfast run.Addresses: Gimme!

Hehe, o Tina, Stacey and I love your baking related adventures. Maybe some of us will try to get a job at Balthazar after graduation....
So Sicaffe or Gimme Coffee? :)I had a strrrrrong cappuccino yesterday at school, it was made with Illy coffee (yea, I know, it suck but I needed it+I told them to make it short and strong), and it shook me REAL bad, I am not even kidding. I felt sick and not good at all for the rest of the day, very akward, I never had symptoms that strong before.

Tea: Haha...thanks! :)  If I have to pick a stronger brew, that would be Sicaffe. I would say Gimme! is a pleasant wake up call rather than an intense caffeinated drink.Jex: It's tasty indeed.

I'm looking for the perfect cake doughnut, and Balthazar's looks good.  Only $1 too!  I never have a chance to go there for breakfast though.

Jessica: It's pretty close to the perfect cake donut, I must say. Could you try to swing in around the weekend mornings? They might have some...dbdtron: I LOVE their donuts. I haven't tried their chocolate cake donut yet.

A Crazy Night of Fooding…(P*Ong, Alta, and the Dessert Truck) Part 2

I apologize for two reasons on this post: 1. I'm preposterously late posting this up. (It's been nearly two weeks. TWO WEEKS?!) and 2. Some of my photos suck that I'm borrowing a few of Robyn's photos for the sake of saving you some of my dreadfully blurry photos. This post is continuing on the evening after the \"amuse-bouche\" at P*Ong (as Ariel called it) and moving on to the real dinner at Alta. So, here we go...I've coordinated this dinner just because Jessica's back in town for the weekend and Robyn told to me that she never tried tapas before. Since I've been to Alta last June and had a fairly good experience and that it's a great for groups, I started rounding up people who can come and reserved a table for 9 people. But as the evening rolled in, it went down to 7 due to last minute happenings. Robyn, Jessica, Ariel, Doug, Patrick, and Helen were the lucky ones who were able to join in on the tapas feast.Typical Alta scene and an odd decorAriel, Jessica, and I arrived to Alta earlier than expected since P*Ong is about 3 or 4 blocks away. The place was packed and it's clamoring with people at the bar who probably left work and chill out there. We checked in with the host and he walked us up to the second floor where the kitchen is located and he walked to the back. I hesitated to follow him for a few moments since I was wondering, \"Am I supposed to enter the kitchen?\" But I proceeded along with everyone else and discovered that I reserved a table that's in their private dining room. As you'll see the photo below, you know how it kind of looks like (with Ariel perusing the menu).We got the private party room!We all perused their lengthy tapas menu and thought long and hard what the heck do we want to eat. The waiter wanted us to use one of those menus and check off what we want to order since we're a large group, it'll make our lives easier. Ariel suggested that each of us to pick two dishes since it should be about enough food to go around for everyone. Despite the fact we did joke about having the \"The Whole Shebang\" for $350, we checked off a little less than a third of their menu (technically about 31%).While we were deciding our orders, one of the hosts came to our table and asked us, \"Are you going to stay here the entire night? We have another group coming around 9 and we need this table if your party isn't complete.\" We all know that we're not going to linger that long and we said, \"No.\" He left us to our conversations and Helen and I felt a bit annoyed about that announcement.Anyways, we passed the menu to our waiter and let the kitchen work their magic to create a feast of 14 dishes in less than 2 hours.Tuna TartareTruffle Surprise and Lamb meatballsWe started out with three dishes: the Tuna Tartare, the Philadelphia Truffle Surprise, and the Lamb Meatballs. The tuna tartare was tasty - the silky cubes of fresh tuna with crunchy bits of macadamia nuts, hearts of palm, and a slight spicy kick from the chorizo sausage. The Philadelphia truffle surprise was one of the few dishes that I tried last time, and I still find it to be very good. Deep fried puff pastries encasing the creamy, musky truffle-oil infused goat cheese - how can you go wrong with that? Then the lamb meatballs, which were recommended by the waiter, was a hit as well. The melt-in-your-mouth meatballs with a touch of anise-y flavor to mask the gaminess of the lamb with toasted sesame seeds and lebne (a type of soft cheese made from yogurt) accompanied with a dollop of spiced butternut squash foam. Just to note, the foam isn't really the foam you would normally associate in restaurants, it's more like whipped butternut squash mash. I know it doesn't sound so elegant but that's what it was basically.Then the servers started to cram our table with almost everything we ordered! Not only the fact that we're overwhelmed with so many dishes within a short time span but also we're passing plates around so the food photographers (Robyn, Jessica, and I) could take snapshots.CocaThe coca was very good. It's basically a long, über thin bread that's been smothered with chopped, roasted mushrooms and boschetto truffle cheese and ricotta with herbs. This particular dish is for the fungus and cheese loving crowd since the earthy flavors of the mushrooms and truffle from the cheese, oomphed with the silky-creamy textures with the ricotta.Olives and scallops (the latter's Robyn's photo)The long, skinny plate of Bella di Cerignola, Moroccan cured and Arbequina olives I do admit, I didn't try since I don't exactly care for olives that much. I do appreciate it's briny and salty taste that it contributes to dishes but I don't like eating it alone. But that's just my preference. The sea scallops with artichoke puree, yuzu mayonnaise, and salmon caviar was fine. The sweetness of the scallop was contrasted with the tart, citrus-y yuzu mayonnaise and the salmon caviar brought a salty flavor to the party, along with the playful \"pop\" texture when you bite on it.Then I moved onto my favorite dish from Alta - the BRUSSELS SPROUTS. You know I don't normally capitalize any food's name but this is worth screaming for! The crispy, fried brussels sprouts, mixed with sweet chunks of Fuji apples, rich tartness from the crème fraiche, topped with crunchy pistachio nuts. Jeebus, I wouldn't mind eating pounds of these... But then again, the health benefits of brussels sprouts have been depleted from the frying part. Oh well.Eggplant dip; Robyn's photoThe smoked eggplant and lebne dip with za'tar, honey, mint lemon zest was tasty. The smooth, slightly smoky eggplant puree was interesting minty, anise-y notes from the za'tar. Nothing much notable about the bread served with the dip except that I preferred it to be toasted or warmed.The peperoncino spaghetti with bottarga di muggine, dried bonito & shrimp oil & pepper cress was a good pasta dish. Its salty nuances from the bottarga di muggine (it's grey mullet roe) and dried bonito used in this dish and the creamy sauce that dressed the pasta lightly.The rabbit confit with trofiette pasta, sunchoke puree, speck, soft boiled egg and fresh oregano was not what I would imagine what it would taste like. Why? Well, this is technically the first time I'm eating a bunny. Confited. This dish is more pasta-centric more than the rabbit since it looked like eighty-percent pasta and twenty percent of everything else bunny, seasonings, and soft-boiled egg. Moving on, this dish tasted fine. I guess my tastebuds don't really like the flavor of a rabbit since it does taste a bit gamy to me that it needs more herbs or something to hide it. But the pasta, egg and everything else was tasty and nicely seasoned. It's arguably one of the least stellar plates of the evening.Chorizo 'n shrimpThe grilled chorizo wrapped Gulf shrimp was another familiar dish. Somehow I'm still not swayed with the fact that the chorizo's skin is a bit too rubbery for the shrimp that the textures don't meld well. But it still tastes good - the slightly spicy sausage cooled by the creamy, tart avocado mousse.Fried goat cheeseThe fried goat cheese with lavender honey was still as delicious as I remembered it. The thin, crisp exterior meets the velvety thick and tangy goat cheese sweetened with the delicately floral honey. It's one of the favorites for us.The house-made grilled merguez (pictured on the right) with couscous, lebne, and harissa was an ok dish to me. As much as I like the elements of the dish, nothing really stuck out on my mind in terms of flavor.Caramelized cauliflowerIn terms of the caramelized cauliflower that was recommended in Chowhound, I'm not lauding it to the same level as the delectable brussels sprouts. It was respectable in terms of making cauliflower intriguing with the sweet, chewy raisins and spicy chorizo. Despite there were manila clams in this dish, somehow I missed out and didn't get to taste that part.Frogs' LegsThe frogs' legs with cauliflower walnut puree, saffron pear, beet chips, and micro arugula was another ok dish to me since I don't really like frogs' legs that much. It's something odd about eating the flesh of a frog that tastes like a cross between fish and chicken. It alienates my tastebuds that it wants to reject it. But it ain't so bad with the other accouterments that accompanied this dish that it ameliorates the fishy taste by a fraction by bringing in some nutty and fruity flavors to the frog leg.This photo is meant to indicate that I'm not a voracious (to a certain extent) person and I did eat with other people. It was a lot of fun being fed without a break but I hated the fact that we finished in less than an hour! From the now two times eating here, I don't understand why the kitchen cooks their food so quickly. As much as I appreciate the fact that I could get my food almost instantaneously, I would like to take my time eating without being rushed out the door. Anyways, the good part that our check for the dinner came out to be approximately $22 per person, which is basically a steal for dinner in New York City.Originally I invited Kathy to join us for dinner but she can't due to work. However, she told Robyn and I that she would be able to join us after dinner. For dessert. Yeah, I'm going for another round of desserts since Ariel and Robyn never tried the Dessert Truck's dessert before. So, we all walked over to University Place and found a short line of people waiting for some inexpensive, gourmet desserts.Chocolate bread pudding and BomboloniSince I felt pretty full after eating at P*Ong and Alta, I didn't wait on line. Knowing that Ariel have a large stomach capacity, he managed to get himself the chocolate bread pudding with bacon crème anglaise since it sounds strange (the bacon part, that is). I took a small spoon of his dessert and while it does taste really chocolate-y and gooey, I didn't really detect much of the smoky bacon flavor in the sauce. Probably because I'm in a food coma that my tastebuds cease to work with my brain? But it's not a bad dessert.Robyn and Patrick got themselves bomboloni, which is basically small, round donuts (except their version is fried brioche dough), that are rolled in cinnamon and sugar filled with vanilla cream. It's tasty, not too sweet and it does satisfy the sweet tooth. But my stomach felt like it's going to explode if I'm going to consume any more food!This concludes the evening of intense fooding, at least in my eyes. I think my body was having a hard time digesting food that week since it was Chinese New Year and my parents were cooking non-stop and feeding me like there's no tomorrow. It was really great to get to see some of the people since my birthday lunch, meet a new reader, Patrick, and it's always fun to eat out with Robyn, Kathy, and Ariel.Addresses: Alta 64 W 10th St New York, NY 10011Dessert Truck E 8th Street & University Place New York, NY 10003

I too fell absolutely in love with the Brussel Sprouts at Alta. I think it was the most unique tapas dish and a wonderful way of breaking out of the common \"EWWW Brussels Sprouts\" stereotype. I wasn't too crazy about the tuna tartare though, as well as the chocolate bread pudding from Dessert Truck :(

A Crazy Night of Fooding...(P*Ong, Alta, and the Dessert Truck) Part 1

***CONTENT
Friday night was arguably the most gluttonous night of I ever had - a pre-dinner tasting at P*Ong, a full blown tapas feast at Alta and post-dinner desserts at the Dessert Truck. I don't know how I actually survived but it was pretty darn awesome, especially with a group of good friends to enjoy it with me.As a fair warning, some of my photos will be blurry due to a variety of reasons that cause camera shake, mainly the poor lighting, so just bear with me on several blips and hopefully your vision is still intact from figuring out the images before you...P*OngI planned the pre-dinner outing at P*Ong with Ariel and Jessica for being curious about pastry chef Pichet Ong's food and the location since it's so close to Alta. My intention really was to get a small tasting flight and move on to the actual dinner.InteriorThe interior is very sleek and minimalist, pillows strewn along the banquette seating. The bar is where most of the action takes place where two chefs actually create dishes in this small setting.Once we were all seated and took several minutes thinking about what to eat - we ended up choosing a dish for ourselves and share a nibble or two. Ariel ordered the chocolate foie gras taco, I ordered the Stilton soufflé and Jessica wanted the kabocha bread pudding. It took a long time for the kitchen to produce our dishes since we all talked a while and Ariel commented the fact that he's getting hungry and the kitchen's taking their time getting our food out. But in good time, they finally served it the moment after Ariel said it.Ariel's chocolate foie gras taco sounded like the weirdest thing on the menu, hence his reason to choose (besides his love for foie). Somehow, the odd combination of chocolate, foie gras, pineapple, and cognac all worked so well like a well composed symphony that it blew our minds. The sweet, slightly acidic pineapple lightened the dense flavors of the foie; the chocolate taco shell added a delicate, earthy, bittersweetness; and the cognac well...added a faint hint of citrusy booze. The condiments emphasized the greatness of the foie gras. Ariel and I agreed in vague terms that this dish was an aphrodisiac. Long live the fatty duck liver.Jessica's kabocha bread pudding was not what I would normally think as bread pudding. The bread pieces in this pudding is diced so finely that it doesn't gel like bread pudding normally would be - it's all mush. In terms of taste, it's balanced nicely with pumpkin and spices of nutmeg, cinnamon, and allspice but nothing really struck me as great as the foie gras taco. The ricotta ice cream that accompanied the bread pudding was fine albeit it tasted more vanilla-like than ricotta.(Blurry) blondies served with the checkAfter we finished our food, we asked for the check since we have to hop over to Alta for the actual dinner. Technically, this check almost equivalate to how much we all paid at Alta (that post is going to be written soon). We were served small chunks of blondies with the check. I'm not a fan of blondies just because it's not intensely chocolate-y as a brownie. Since a blondie is the opposite of a brownie but I ate it anyway. It's moist, warm and the chocolate used in it was of good quality.Do I like P*Ong? I'm in ambivalent since I love that foie gras dish and the lukwarm reception to the rest of the dishes. I would give them a second chance.Please stay tuned for the remainder of the evening...Address: P*Ong 150 W 10th Street New York, NY 10014

I enjoyed Pong immensely.  But I think it's a little like WD50.  You need to go the tasting menu route.  Some things are great, some are not so great but very interesting.  The one major letdown for me was the stilton souffle as you mentioned.  It's a boring dish compared to everything else.  Definitely go again.

Tony: In regards to your comment about WD-50, that would be in the savory courses since the time I tried out their food back in December, there were hits and misses. However, I loved every single dessert I had at WD. I'll try P*Ong again sometime soon.

i went when they first opened and i wasn't inclined to return.  if i lived in NYC, i might, hoping they improve.i think Tailor, different but in the same school, executes much better (despite the lack of praise for the place.)- chuck

Chuck: I do hope P*Ong does improve within a few months. I do agree that both chefs are from the same school - mingling the sweet and savory flavors in hopes to produce something profound.I was thinking about going to Tailor but I'm postponing this particular place since I have reservations to a different restaurant next weekend.

I know I'm supposed to owe you guys my belated post about last Friday's fooding...that's if you saw my Flickr photos ever since the weekend. I apologize since I'm technically waiting for Robyn's photos of that evening since a few of mine suck (as in blurry) and I actually forgot to take a photo of a dish we had. Gasp! :O So, I need to borrow a few of her photos. Just give me another day or two and I'll post it up. Hopefully.Moving on... In case I haven't told you, I'm recently employed to Sloan-Kettering in the Upper East Side obviously not doing anything related to food but I'm trying to find something tasty around the area since it's practically a food wasteland, unless someone can tell me what's tasty around there or I need to discover them.SicaffeAnyways, this afternoon I had a strange craving for coffee, namely an espresso-based drink. Since I'm not far from Sicaffe, I walked over and ordered my usual drink whenever I'm there, the cappuccino triestino. Except the interaction between me and the barista went differently than normal, so here how it went:\"Hi. I like to have the cappuccino triestino.\" \"Sure. How many shots do want in it? One, two, or three?\" [five seconds of thinking to self] \"Uh...I'll have three.\" \"Three?\" [Mutters under his breath, \"Oh shit...!\"] [Returns to normal voice.] \"For here or to go?\" A slight smile crosses my face, \"For here.\" A minute later, I got my beautiful triple shot cappuccino...Mid-day energy boostAfter I drank this up, I returned the glass to the counter and the same barista asked me, \"Is it strong enough?\" I replied with a grin, \"Yes.\" He thanked me. I left the shop and walked back to work, quicker than usual for two reasons: I'm caffeinated and it's starting to snow and I'm under dressed for that (e.g. no hat or snowboots on).

I go to school literally across the street :)  I recommend Caffe Bacio for coffee and Cafe Mingala for some tasty Burmese.  You're right, though, the E. 60-70s is a relative wasteland for yumminess.

Tina....When my friend Stacey (she's like my sister, so we do everything together, hehe) and I come to the City, you HAVE to take us to a place like this. I need a REAL coffee like that as soon as possible. Here at school they serve Illy and I hate it, it's so acidic! DId you try it? I'm sure you did ;)

Good luck on finding yumminess on the UES. I have lived in this nabe for years and look forward to reading about some of your finds. I am sure that you are more resourceful than I am. I just give up and eat in other neighborhoods. A couple of good places are JG Melon for burgers and Uskudar for Turkish. Can't think of much else.

Tea: We shall go there! But you have to tell me when you're free, ya know? Shoot me an e-mail.About Illy's espresso, I think it sucks despite its high price tag.G3B: Oooh...I totally forgotten about JG Melon's burger (where'd my head gone to?). About Uskudar, that seems interesting. Thanks!

The Irony of It All...(Restaurant Week at Anthos) and a few announcements

***CONTENT
On Thursday, I had my last Restaurant Week meal at Anthos with Ariel. This pretty much sums up my international food trek of sorts since I started with Indian, French, and now Greek (all nouveau style). I did have hopes of being captivated by Chef Psilakis' food since Ariel went to Kefi, Psilakis' other Greek restaurant, numerous times and been blown away by his food. Did Anthos make me happy or just left me feeling disgusted? If you want to find out, just read on...Lots of people...As you can see, the restaurant's packed with Midtowners on a business lunch meeting or the similar vein of what I'm doing - having lunch here for the sake of Restaurant Week. At several occasions when I'm having a conversation with Ariel or when I'm trying to listen to the waiter, I had a hard time listening. I don't know if it has to do with the acoustics there or plainly, it's just too many people there that it's a bit annoying not to be able to hear someone.Moving on to the food, we were a bit perplexed in terms of which menu to order off of. Strangely, they offer the Anthos Winter RW 2008 menu, the regular prix-fixe menu and the a la carte. For the budgeted gourmands like us, we had a hard time deciding whether or not to order from the RW menu or their normal prix-fixe. What the waiter told us, the difference between the two were that the normal had a few different options that normally wouldn't show up on the menu, only for dinner (and a $4 difference). The only thing that broke the tie, per se, was that Ariel was interested in the \"Sesame\" dessert that was in the regular menu. Hence we defeated the purpose of eating out at Restaurant Week; we didn't order from the Restaurant Week menu.Goat's Milk Butter & 7-Grain BreadThe bread was pretty good since it was warm and it's somehow a bit sweeter than what I would associate a seven-grain roll. The goat's milk butter was tangy with a salty punch and the best part was that it's served at room temperature.As we noshed on our bread and chatted away for a while, we noticed for a long time (say ten minutes or so) that our appetizers hasn't arrived yet. About the time Ariel was trying to call the waiter over about our whereabouts of our food, the waiter immediately apologized and said that the kitchen was backed up on the food and will bring out a complimentary dish to us - which turned out to be the meze course.The mezes were overall very good. I was kind of expecting thinly cut pieces of fish (think of sashimi style) but they're not. They're cut quite thickly like a quarter-inch thick that makes it more meaty and chewier than what I would want for fresh fish like this. Anyways, the best overall in flavor was the snapper since it's quite complex ranging from tart to sweet. From the cobia meze, we both liked the Greek yogurt, just because Greek yogurt's awesomely rich and creamy.Finally came our appetizers arrived...Close up of Sheep Milk Ricotta DumplingsAriel's sheep milk ricotta dumplings were pretty good. It's light, slightly chewy with subtle tang from the sheep's milk ricotta. The sauce that accompanied it was quite buttery and the kale (I think?) was a nice green to give it some bitterness to cut the richness of the dumplings.EscargotsMy pot of escargots was cooked perfectly that it's soft and chewy. But the sauce was extremely creamy. What I really mean, it's purely cooked in heavy cream with a touch of butter and herbs and it's emphasized with more butter with buttered, toasted croûtons. Jeebus, I was dying with fat overload with this dish. Of course it tasted good but then my stomach isn't used to this delicious decadence.As for our main course, Ariel had the highly touted lamb burger (according to Gael Greene and Frank Bruni) came to be a bit disappointing in terms of flavor since he was expecting something more Greek influenced. What he got was a large, coarsely ground burger that exudes its juices down his fingers from the first two bites. It definitely stuffed him but he's underwhelmed from his expectations. But he added his own touch of decadence by smearing goat butter on top of his burger.Innards & Buttered burgerRoasted Chicken & a close upMy roasted chicken dish was fine. It's perfectly cooked and well seasoned but the flavors weren't exciting to me. The chicken was slightly dressed with a swash of broccoli puree and a few florets, as well as a few spears of the delicately sweet leek. It's nice but I don't love it.Then finally, dessert...Sesame Ice CreamAriel's sesame ice cream was intensely sesame flavored and somewhat gritty from the toasted, ground sesame seeds. The finely ground bits of stuff (I don't remember what it was) added on a crunchy, toothsome texture. This wasn't what Ariel had in mind since he was thinking about this Sesame dessert that he read from NY Magazine.This particular dessert was another gratis dish for making us wait. It's rice pudding encased in a phyllo dough dusted with cinnamon-sugar. The interesting elements were the quenelle of smooth, tart and savory-like pomegranate-oregano sorbet and jam that is streaked across the plate. It played well in terms of temperature differences of warm and cold.My dessert of choice was the bougatza, which is really a goat cheesecake rolled in katafi. It's accompanied with a goat's milk caramel (I didn't really taste goat's milk here) and a lovely apple compote. The cheesecake itself tasted like a sweet form of chevre with crispy bits of phyllo dough, sweetened even further with the caramel sauce and apples.So, that's pretty much our meal - pretty bad service since they're overwhelmed with the amount of diners for Restaurant Week with subpar food. Would I come back here on a normal day? Probably not.Now, the announcements...For some reason, someone nominated me for this food blogging contest: Culinate's Death by Chocolate. I don't know how am I notable for chocolate exactly...but I'm flattered that someone did nominate me. So thank you, whoever you are for nominating me. But now, I have to ask you my readers for your support and VOTE FOR ME! Not like I'm going to win, since most of the other candidates are much better writers than I am. But hey, it doesn't hurt trying...and thank you if you do vote (it ends on Friday, Feb. 8th).In case I don't write by Wednesday, which I doubt anyways, Happy Lunar New Year!Address: Anthos 36 W 52nd Street New York, NY 10019

Nice review, beautiful pics as always. Modern interpretation of Greek Food is being a trend at the moment. In Athens several restaurants try to reinvent traditonal Greek dishes, or use Greek ingredients for totally new creations and also fusion food. I remember Restaurant 48 in Athens using Mastixa (gum from the mastik tree) as an icecream flavor. The most impressing modern Greek dish to me was the calamari pesto at Varoulko. The calamari are cut so that they look like spaghetti and covered with a mild pesto. Never had such tender and tasty calamari before. Here's my review of Varoulko http://blindtasting.twoday.net/stories/1896736/ and here's a blog with a Pic of the dish http://rwapplewannabe.wordpress.com/2008/02/01/varoulko-restaurant-athens/Regards,Alex

In terms of the ice cream, it's sounds so interesting that I would try it.

Sorry to hear that your meal was a disappointment. Everyone seems to shower Anthos with praise in the press; makes me second guess the stuff I read. And I went to an indian restaurant for RW and basically the menu was the same and I just ordered from the regular menu. If they could just come up with a top ten list of RW menus...And Happy Lunar New Year to you too! :)

The ricotta dumplings sounds wonderful. I wonder if it's similar to ricotta gnocchi?The desserts all look great and varied, versus the typical desserts found in typical restaurants. It's interesting that the sorbet was a bit savory.

Danny: In terms of RW menus, we'll never know since they usually don't publish them early...even if I request them a week before my reservations.Christina: The ricotta dumplings tastes exactly like ricotta gnocchi. Not like it's a bad thing it's just confusing to people about the names...The desserts were good but somehow they're missing that extra something to make it memorable.

Edit (4/15/08): As per this commentor's request, I took down the photo of looking down the bar, if you noticed any changes from the first time you've seen prior to this edit. You will be able to see on my Flickr photostream but not on my blog, per se. But at least you still got the food porn!KO!As you remember me posting my urgent, desperate need last week about my reservations to Momofuku Ko, I have indeed found people. YAY! It's not a failed mission...not like many things in my life. Anyways, I met up with Andrea, her friend, Grace, and Kyle. Everyone arrived before I have since I was in Chelsea running errands and admittedly shopping for a new camera. Yes, I have upgraded to a 5D and retired my Rebel XTi.The book of booze and Place settingAs I sat down on the stools for a four-top (which was the corner spot on the bar), one of the waitresses/hostess gave me a Moleskine notebook of booze. Since I can't handle any alcohol that's beyond the total of two wine glasses, I passed and awaited for the food and chat with my guests of the evening.The place setting was very simple - a folded napkin, a pair of chopsticks set on top of a cork that had a diagram engraved with something have to do with \"experiment\" - I can't recall too well. The bar is made of a warm, blonde wood with a few pegs on the bottom to hold bags. The stools were backless and made of the same type of wood; not exactly as cushy as what you would encounter in L'Atelier de Joël Robuchon but it's fine.Mmmm...fancy pork rinds!After waiting about five minutes or so, the cooks presented us with two orders of amuses to share among us - chicharrón. Basically, it's a fancier version of pork rinds made of Four Story Hill farm pork skin and seasoned with togarashi. It's tasty and quite familiar.Amuse #2: English Muffins + PORK FATSoon after that, came in our second amuse of the evening, housemade English muffins with rendered pork fat and green onions. I'm not really an English muffin person. It's awfully dry and unpalatable when it comes to the stuff my mom buys from the grocery store. But this sets the standard of how an English muffin should be. Crisp with little nooks and crannies with salty rendered pork fat permeating its tangy, thin core. I wish I have this for breakfast everyday - without getting atherosclerosis.(Scallop, on the left; Fluke, on the right) Sashimi, Poppy Seeds, Chives, Spicy ButtermilkMoving onto the fluke and scallop sashimis, poppy seeds, chives, spicy buttermilk, were a great starter for the dinner. The silky freshness of both types of seafood meets the creamy, slightly spicy buttermilk sauce and the nutty crunch from the poppy seeds. Personally, the fluke shined better here since it's cut thinner, giving it a more silky texture. (I should note that the fluke was given to myself and Grace, while the scallops were given to Kyle and Andrea).Thr Pour; Kimchi Consommé with Long Island Oyster on a half shell with Crispy Pork BellyThe next course, Kimchi consommé with Long Island oyster on a half shell with crispy pork belly was interesting. The spicy, clear broth contributed the warm mouth feel and gave the silky oyster a kick to it's briny meat. The pork belly was crisp and as it absorbed the kimchi consommé, it adds on an additional layer of moisture, making it more softer and more moist.I LOVE YOU!This dish is certainly one of the highlights of the evening: Coddled egg with soubise onions, sweet potato vinegar, hackleback caviar, potato chips, parsley chervil. The oozy yolk that gently cascades over the small pile of soft, creamy, sugary sweet onions mingling with the pop-like texture of the caviar. Oooh...it made my palate dancing with joy. The potato chips were precious and very crisp; contrasting the smooth and chewy textures of the dish.Scallop with Clams (on the left); Fluke with Clams (on right), Trumpet Mushroom Puree, Pickled Fennel, Nori, and Bacon DashiThe scallop with clams, trumpet mushroom puree, pickled fennel, nori, and bacon dashi was served to Kyle and Andrea, while Grace and I had the fluke with clams, trumpet mushroom puree, pickled fennel, nori, and bacon dashi. The sweet, meaty scallops fared a lot better than the fluke due to the lovely sear, cooked to perfection. The fluke was a nice but it lacked the complexity compared to the scallop. The clams, dashi and mushrooms gave it an earthy and briny elements and it the flavors were very clean.In between courses, I managed to take this photo down the bar. It just look like everyone's bowing down their heads to revere and contemplate the food and the chefs. Which in many ways, can be that argument...the maniacal reservation clicking, and the buzz before opening, etc. Anyways, back to the food...I LOVE YOU TOO!The other dish that truly amazed me was the shaved foie gras torchon with Riesling jelly, lychee, and pinenuts. The thin layer of grated foie gras was so ethereal yet accomplished so much in terms of its silky textures and balances the flavor of the dish. The sweet-savory nuances of this dish went from juicy, fruity, and delicately sweet and went to the flip side of savory with the foie and the buttery pinenuts. Man, talk about foodgasm in every bite...Innards of the Foie dishDeep Fried Short Ribs with Grilled Scallion, Pickled Daikon, and Pickled Mustard SeedsNow we move onto a heartier dish, deep fried short ribs with grilled scallion, pickled daikon, and pickled mustard seeds. As any person who likes food (and isn't exactly health conscious) would go with the mantra, \"You can't go wrong with fried food.\" In most ways yes, but for my own dish it seemed a tad too overcooked that perhaps I don't enjoy it as much as the others were. It was crisp and moist but a tad tough. The nice touches were the crunchy, pickled vegetables to cut the fattiness of the dish.Miso Soup and Grilled Rice with Nori, Rolled in Pork Fat, With Pickled Turnips and CabbageThe miso soup and grilled rice with nori, rolled in pork fat with pickled turnips and cabbage is basically the finisher of the savory course, meaning after this dish, we're moving to dessert. The miso soup is the best I've tasted by far in the city, where most just gets it wrong, afflicting my taste buds with a bucket load of salt. But this is perfection - balanced, great body, and enough salt that my tongue doesn't scream for water. As for the little cylinder of rice, it was nice and crisp from the grill and the vegetables gave it an additional textural interest with a touch of sweet-salty brine it's been marinating in.Pre-dessert: Pineapple (on the left); its innards (on the right)We finally moved to the sweets, pre-dessert: pineapple. This is basically a palate cleanser of sorts by having this refreshing, über pineapple-y dessert. The pineapple sorbet's ice crystals were so fine that I almost thought I'm eating ice cream and it's not very sweet - just intense pineapple. To go an extra step with the pineapple, they added a small pile of chewy, dried chunks of pineapple for something beyond smooth. That was lovely.Deep Fried Apple Pie, Sour Ice Cream, Toasted MisoWe're now at the grand finale: deep fried apple pie, sour ice cream, toasted miso. The first thing I thought when I saw this pie was that it looks similar to the McDonald's apple pie due to its shape. In terms of flavor, it's very different. Eating this pie alone actually tastes insipid - it needs more cinnamon. But when you do eat a little bit of everything with it (sour cream ice cream and the miso swash in the back) it's wonderful, though I do prefer having creme fraiche ice cream instead. The only thing that made this particular dish different than anything else in the city is the use of the extremely salty miso that amplified the entire dish's elements that created multiple tones of flavors makes it remarkable.After eating at our pace of nearly two hours or so, we're all satiated (some had the booze) and we paid our check. In case you didn't know by now the entire tasting menu is $85 and the wine and sake pairings are an additional $50 pre-tax and tip. It's not cheap eats, but it's a lot cheaper than Per Se or a lot of other restaurants that strictly do tasting menus. My verdict: YOU MUST TRY IT!Address: Momofuku Ko 163 1st Avenue New York, NY 10003

Looks great! Good to hear that after all the reservation hassle it was worth it! (At least I think Momofuku Ko is the restaurant people were giving reservation tips for!).At the current RoE, £42.50 for a tasting menu like this is a bargain, ha ha.

Hi Tina,My pictures of Ko didn'tcome out so well.  I'm trying to do my write up and my English muffin picture is so blurred it is unrecognzable.  If possible could I use your muffin picture?  Of course I'll give you total props.  It was my favorite part of the meal and I really want to be able to show it.Let me know what you think.  If not that's okay as well!  I'll always love your blog :)

There are now quite a few new dishes on the \"menu\".  Look for langoustine, pea sprouts and sweet pea consomme, and a dessert that involves toasted corn flakes and chocolate.I don't know when I'll return.  Ko is indeed very, very good (and ought to be, given that the reservation system is insane).

The picture you have up of the diners is of me and I would like you to take it down.  I would also just like to tell you that it is extremely annoying to have the person sitting next to you taking a million pictures of every dish.  Being as how this is a communal restaurant your incessant picture taking is quite distractive to other diners who are trying to enjoy their expensive meals. Are there no manners in this \"me first\" internet age?I for one do really enjoy food, you and your group however were more interested in the status dining at a place like Ko offers rather than enjoying the food.   You might need to rethink your priorities when eating out and try and live in the moment as opposed to doing things for your \"blog\" cachet.

2008-04-14 15:03:00
Marvis: First of all, I don't have a picture of you on this post. It's your friend who dined with you that evening who didn't protest like you. Also, you've dodged my camera anyway so why do you care? I don't even use flash.I would ask you, if say the NY Times or some big publication actually brought their photographer to a restaurant you happened to dine in that night and took a photo of you, would you complain?I enjoy my meals at every food establishment I ever been to thoroughly. I paid this out of my own pocket and I take photos out of the mere joy of loving food and I remember everything that happened and what I ate.

Thank you for what you do. Some of us cannot get to NYC to dine at these places so we live through the lens of foodbloggers and we appreciate it. I would hope that if I ever tooka  pic of somebody at a restaurant they would okay it, if not I would take it down. The manner in which you posted, Marvis, was hostile from the start. I am sure if you would have sent a private email you would have gotten the same result but what do I know I live ina  flyover state. Thank you again WE I love your work.

Your post and pictures have been a great really helpful in planning our stay, and I'm sure I'm not the only person who really appreciates them.It's obvious from all your writing how important the food, as opposed to what ol' grumpy guts up there calls 'status dining', is to you. Keep up the good work!

Chicken Fried Gourmet: Thanks for the compliment. Yes, Marvis was hostile but I got over it.Edgy555: Aren't we all conflicted? Most of the time, I would take photos without asking until a staff member (e.g. waiter) would ask me nicely, not to. If Marvis was actually asked me not to photograph him, fine. I won't take a photo of you, just my food and the general people who don't protest.Amanda: I agree. Though, Marvis ain't old.Liz: You're welcome. Thanks for the compliment.J: Thank you! I wish I could get compensated...alas, it's not going to happen.

The short ribs may have been a tad tough because they looked like they were medium rare. Because of where this cut comes from unless it is braised or very slowly cooked over a length of time you will have from a bit to a whole weekends worth of chewing. The only med rare short ribs I ever had that were tender at med rare was thinly sliced Kobe style Wagyu.

Tapas Dinner at Islero

A few Thursdays ago, I planned a dinner with Ariel to Islero, a new tapas restaurant and bar that's located in Midtown East. I sort of picked this place just because I wanted to try something different.We originally started small since Ariel's complaining that he ate a fairly heavy lunch at Adrienne's Pizza Bar. So, I taken it into account and we ordered four dishes and a dessert:Arroz Cremoso Sopa de Castanas Conchinta Plums & Figs Peanut Butter Spoons (dessert)But we ended up having a mini-feast of sorts and having a total of six courses and two desserts - due to the co-owner spotting me with my camera and gave us a few comped dishes.The added courses did not sway my thoughts on what I thought of this place. Some dishes were good and some were okay. It's basically a good place to have dinner after work, a casual date, or to eat out with a small group (this space is relatively small and narrow).Go to my photoset for the food photos and my comments.Address: Islero 247 East 50th Street New York, NY 10022

[I know I'm supposed to write about a dinner that took place about two...almost three weeks ago but I don't feel motivated to write such a lengthy post about it yet. So, bear with me as I have a short post for you about my stop at the newly minted, The Mercury Dime.]ExteriorI believe good coffee is the reason why I get my butt up early from bed and go to the city for work. For the past week or two, I heard of The Mercury Dime is opening and stopping in the nabe to check it out. The problem is, they're still closed, leaving me a tired, cranky person who is in dire need of COFFEE! (No, I'm not a coffee addict. I just depend on it when I have little sleep or when I crave it). On Tuesday (when I stopped in), they're finally opened!View of the bar (on the left); view out the window (on the right)Coffee MenuAs I perused the menu, I thought to myself do I need a straight-up espresso shot or just go for the cappuccino? Gauging on how much I need the caffeine, I didn't need it as bad as other days so I went for the cappuccino. The barista was kind enough to give me a Regina sesame cookie despite the fact I didn't order anything to eat.BreakfastYou could tell there's an absence of pretty latte art on this cup of joe but the taste makes up for it - bold and smooth with a hint of fruit at the end without much milk to get in the way. The Regina cookie is from De Robertis Pasticceria. Even though I haven't been to that bakery but this cookie is good - a crunchy, nutty element to go with this cappuccino.Ah...I wouldn't mind lingering in this laid-back, lounge-y café but I have to go to work. I bid the barista farewell and hope to stop by again if I'm ever motivated to get out of my house early.Address: The Mercury Dime 246 East 5th Street New York, NY 10003

UPDATE (3/13/08, 7:35 PM): Alrighty...I got enough responses (e-mail, especially) about the reservation that I even have a backups for the diners I'll meet. Anyways, thank you everyone for taking your time to read and e-mail or comment my post. I really appreciate the feedback.UPDATE (3/14/08, 3:43 PM): Okee, I already have 2 spots taken...a few hours ago. BUT, there's a possibility that I do have one more seat open since my usual fooding friend is actually having doubts on the awesomeness of Momofuku Ko's meal due to its price tag. So...ONE MORE TO GO!Hi readers! I have to make an important announcement...Uh huh...I GOT A RESERVATION AT MOMOFUKU KO! Woohoo! Problem is, I don't have enough people... I \"accidentally\" got a reservation for 4 since I happened to click on it for the sake of keeping my account active before they give me an error message. Anyways, I need two other people to join me for dinner. I ain't paying for you and it's a bit pricey (about $100 for 6 courses) but so far, I heard the food and its wine pairings are phenomenal!So...if you want to join me, either comment here on this post or shoot me an e-mail with a legit e-mail address so I can contact you.Hope to see you soon!

Lunch at Bar Boulud & I Need Your Recommendations (for Philly)!

Bar BouludI was in the Upper West Side for lunch on Tuesday. All in the name of Bar Boulud! In case you haven't read through blogs and press publications, it's a huge deal since Daniel Boulud hasn't opened any new restaurants around here and the fact that he migrated crosstown from the Upper East Side (just try to map where most of his places are: Daniel and Cafe Boulud).It looks like a tunnel (on left) Oooh...meats along the bar (on right)Arriving there at 1 PM, in this drizzly, Tuesday afternoon, I was welcomed by a hostess whose greeting felt a bit forced and a bit too perky than what I am normally accustomed to. As I walked to my table, this place is adorned in pale golden wood, modestly decorated with paintings along the walls, and the long bar beholds a huge meat slicer and the highly touted charcuterie and hams.I perused their lunch menu (which is different than their dinner menu), I decided to try out their prix fixe menu.Warm toasts tucked in a napkinAssiette AnglaiseI tried the Assiette Anglaise, which is a derivative of their charcuterie sampler - three terrines, two fromages (cheese), and two vegetable sides, or hors d'oeuvres as they called it. (Click on the photo to know what food item is what).The terrines were sublime. Silky slices of ground meat that isn't too jelly and balanced with enough fat, spices, and seasonings. My personal favorite of the three was the rabbit. The cheeses served that day were a smooth, firm, subtly fruity Pleasant Ridge Reserve and a creamy, bloomy, luscious, mushroom-y, Brie de Meaux. I just wish I had larger portions of the cheese. As for the hors d'oeuvres, I don't really care for them much but it tastes fine. The choices given to me were the potato, fennel, olive and the celery-apple rémoulade. The flavors for the potato dish was a bit too subtle that nothing really enhances the potato, but the rémoulade fared a bit better in terms of flavor and textures - crunchy, sweet and tart with creamy mayonnaise.Tarte MochaClose ups of the tartAs for the finale of this meal, I opted for the tarte mocha. Nothing strange in terms of funky combinations of textures or ingredients - just a straightforward, very good tart. The chocolate pâte sucrée was buttery, chocolatey, and barely sweetened; a great canvas for the intense, decadently rich, espresso flavored chocolate ganache, gilded with a flake of varak. The vanilla ice cream was delicious - smooth, velvety, sweet, and intensely flavored with vanilla. I would buy their vanilla ice cream by the gallon, if that's ever possible.Corridor of the wine cellar...After my paying my check, I took a short tour around this place and went downstairs to their wine cellar. It seems strange when it kind of looks like a labyrinth than a cellar, down the hall would be a large private dining room since I heard people talking down on that end and off to the left are the bathrooms.The bathroom sinkEven though this isn't about food, I took a photo of the bathroom sink since it looks kind of cool. The bathroom itself is nice, done with the same pale, blonde wood that you saw in the main dining room.After looking at my watch, my lunch hour's about up and I had to run back to the bus stop in the rain to take me crosstown to work!I Need Your Suggestions!Ok...my aunt and her son is visiting NYC (in less than 2 weeks) and my family's planning on a day trip to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Yep, I'm going to Philly for one day just for sightseeing really, just to do something for the Easter weekend (and I don't have Monday off [groans]). I need your suggestions on where to eat. Basically, I'm looking for something casual and something that ain't so expensive like I eat since my family's paying. We're pretty much up for anything but don't bother with Chinese (because we are and we know how to cook) and Japanese or Thai (since my aunt eats a ton of it in Hong Kong). Thank you!Address: 1900 Broadway New York, NY 10023

I am always so jealous of your meals...if I ever end up in NY, I know where to look for suggestions.  I was in Philly yesterday and although, I am not an expert...I would recommend Reading Market...you can get cheesesteaks and apple dumplings (the Dutch Eating Place) plus there is a ton of other choices.  It is super causal though.  Enjoy!

Giulia: It's all tasty... I just wish I could try a few more things to make a real judgment on it. I feel this particular review is prima facie but something has to be written about this meal.Ginny: Ah, don't be jealous of me, I'm a humble 22-year old who's willing to fork part of her paycheck for a really good meal. Anyways, thanks for the suggestion! I'll look into it!

There are so many good places to eat in Philly! Stephen Starr (who owns Buddakan and Morimoto here in NYC) has about nine restaurants there, the best of which is Alma de Cuba. For delicious tapas, I had one of the best meals ever at Amada, and if you like nuevo Mexican, definitely check out Lolita. All of these places are tasty, comfortable and reasonably priced. Enjoy!

For Philly, I second the Reading Terminal Market suggestion...I remember having amazing pancakes at the Dutch Eating Place. Plus it's just a fun place to poke around.

I'm a frequent visitor to Philly as my employer has an office there ... my favorite restaurants:El Vez - American-Mexican cuisine, very fun hangout, casual.Amada - Excellent tapas, if you're game, tell your waiter to let the chef make whatever he wants ... it was fun and very good!Fogo de Chao - I'm not a fan of chains, but this Brazilian churrascaria is amazing ... I always eat here in Philly and DC.Estia - Good Greek food.Bliss - Contemporary American, very quiet, dark lighting, but some of the best short ribs I've ever had.

Problem is, my family would think I'm nuts to eat gelato or ice cream when it's still cold. Buh.Kimberly: Great list! I'll peruse their menus...and probably have my stomach growl as I read. Hahaha...d'oh.

Philly: try Django.  And, it would be criminal for you to go to Philly and *not* visit Capogiro gelateria (and, you thought I was going to name a cheese steak joint.)
Ida

Fancy:  I recommend going for the lunch at Le Bec Fin and either getting the tasting menu ($54), which includes the ridiculously extravagant dessert chariot, or ordering a la cart and starting with the cassolet de escargots (trust me on this, it comes in the cutest little silver pot with an AMAZING hazelnut butter sauce), getting whatever entree appeals to you, and ending with the dessert chariot.  There is a huge variety of desserts on the chariot.  Last time I went, I am not ashamed to say I had 8 desserts.Casual: I third the recommendation for Reading Terminal.  Definitely try the macaroni and cheese at Delilah's (Oprah's #1 pick for best mac and cheese in the US) and Amish chicken wings (they sell them by the pound) and apple dumplings (cored apple sprinkled with cinnamon sugar, baked in a pastry shell, and drizzled with a caramel sauce)You should definitely have a cheese steak!  I wish you had more time!  I like Jim's on South Street, but Pat's and Geno's are Philly Institutions.  I don't remember the days, but the Ritz used to have a reasonably priced chocolate buffet.  You may want to call them and see if they still have it.Happy eating!

Sabrina's Cafe is definitely worth a try. It's well-known for stuffed french toast and many other brunch items. And I think brunch is served all day.

Hi! I visisted your blog per recommendation from Jess Lin, my roommate and good friend at Cornell. I love your pictures and your writing :) IThe decor of Bar Boulud looks fantastic and the tarte mocha looks amazing. So rich!You're going to Philly? I was there last semester visiting a friend. We went to this amazing BYOB restaurant (lots of places in Philly are BYOB due to stringent liquor license regulations) and I had the most amazing rabbit and foie gras. I'll try to find the name so I can let you know :)

Ulterior Epicure: Thanks for the recommendation! Criminal not to try Capogiro? I hope I could fit them in my schedule...Ida: Damn, I wish I could stay for more than a day! Too many places to eat, so little time... Eh, well at least I know I'll stick around Reading Terminal since it seems like a popular destination from most of you readers.Julie: Hmmm...brunch. Probably I might do it? I have to get the consensus of what my aunt really wants to eat, despite the fact she'll most likely ask for my opinion.Jennifer: Hi! Ah, you know Jess. Weee...! :D I need to thank her. Thanks for loving my blog!As per your Philly suggestions, I don't really need a BYOB restaurant since my family doesn't really drink. BUT...I do like to get my grubby hands on some foie gras. Hahaha...

Since you said it's ... for a family outing, not as expensive as you would normally do and something casual, I hate to say it but many of the suggestions you've heard so far have been the expensive ones -- aside from the Reading Terminal Market.I'd say, you need to go the Second and Chestnut Street area in Olde City.  Why?  Your near Betsy Ross House and the Liberty Bell and other historical Olde City attractions.  And that intersection has maybe 30-40 casual dining spots, from Cuba Libre to Stars and Ploug Irish Pub to two Afgan Restaurants to the Philly Fish Factory and more.So, historical things to see there, Penns Landing area two blocks away, Tons of eatery vareity choices at decent prices.

I live and work in Philly now.  If you are going to be site-seeing in Philadelphia, you'll most likely be in Old City.  I'd try Farmacia on 3rd Street between Market and Chestnut, Cuba Libre on 2nd Street between Market and Chestnut or Jones on the corner of 7th and Chestnut for lunch or dinner.  If you're having dinner, go for Fork, on Market street between 3rd and 4th streets.  All have websites and are reasonably priced and within walking distance of most historical attractions.
Reading Terminal is an awesome experience, too.Enjoy your visit!

By now you may have already gone to Philly, but anyway...I concur that Amada is excellent tapas and blows Alma de Cuba (or any of the other Starr restaurants) out of the water.Another bargain option is Ron's Ribs for truly excellent barbecue...and, although you are chinese, perhaps for the benefit of others as well, there is a truly wonderful Szechuan restaurant on Race street called Four Rivers.  You just can't go wrong with anything on the menu and it is consistently great.  I've traveled all over Asia and have tried virtually every chinese restaurant across all the boroughs of NY and this is the only one that is comparable to authentic Szechuan cuisine.Capogiro for gelato is amazing, better than all of the NY gelato places - and better than much of the gelato that I've had in Italy.Lastly, for fantastic coffee, try La Colombe.  They supply coffee to a lot of the french restaurants in NY; their capucinos are really memorable...Enjoy your trip!

My Food Crush on Mia Dona

***CONTENT
The past week, I took one of those luxurious lunch hours and went to Mia Dona. Why would I pick this place? Well, given to the fact that there's been quite a bit of press from Alan Richman's GQ blog, Ed Levine written a little post about it, and NY Magazine has a video about the food - all seem very positive and enticing that I thought to myself to go there and try it out.Interior; front and backAs I was seated on toward the front of the house where they're lined with leather banquettes and the white brick-lined walls were covered in black and white plates, this restaurant feels casual and it doesn't make me feel like I'm in another one of those stuffy restaurants. Strangely, one of the staff members who were gathered at the end of the bar greeted me in a familiar way, my mind went scrambling to a phase of thinking, \"Should I know her?\" But as I settled down and perused the menu, she walked up to the table and started to chat with me and she told me she remembered me at Anthos (she was one of the hostesses) and now she's working here. So that explains everything.The menuAs you see from the menu above, everything sounds delicious and the food is within the moderate price range, as entrées don't excel $24 (which is the mixed grill of meats and marrow). I ended up choosing the food from their prix fixe menu, just to sample their food at something that is relatively affordable.Mmmm...carbsFocaccia + head of sweet, roasted garlicThe notable things from this particular bread basket were slices of the tomato-y, cheesy, rosemary flavored soft focaccia and a head of roasted garlic. The latter was notable since there wasn't any butter in sight. But when I smeared a whole clove, the caramelized, olive oil and rosemary scented garlic flavor melded well with the focaccia and the peasant bread that I don't miss the butter.Grilled Calamari & Caponata SaladThe grilled calamari and caponata salad was my appetizer. This particular salad is a slight nod to Chef Psilakis' Greek roots even though it's mostly Italian fare. The tender calamari with the soft, silky eggplant, onions, tomatoes, and other vegetables entice my tastebuds. Its an amalgamate of sweet, tart, and savory that hits every note wonderfully. To contrast the soft textures of this salad, were slices of grilled pita bread schmeared with tangy feta cheese, to act as a tastier version of croûtons.Meatloaf!I don't know if you knew this about me, besides I like weird food, is that I'm a sucker for comfort food that's has an unusual twist? Well, now you know. Hence my reason of ordering the meatloaf or what the menu said, \"Polpettone.\" Also if you saw the video that I've linked much earlier on this post, you should have seen the oozy egg yolk - I mean, when I saw it that screams food seduction. Hahaha... Just look at the photo below for my own oozy yolk.OoozyDoes it taste as good as it looks? Oh yeah... The meatloaf isn't as dense as I have anticipated except once you eat it with the egg, it adds substance and toned down the acidic sauce that accompanied the meat. The hen of the woods mushrooms added a subtle earthy flavor to the dish. As I kept on eating this dish, I noticed that I'm getting really full. But I kept on going for dessert.CannoliEven though I ordered one dessert, the gianduja semifreddo, they actually served me two. The complimentary dessert was cannoli. Usually, I'm not a fan of cannoli because they tend to be dense and the fried shell doesn't taste right whenever I order it. But this isn't the same thing. The shell was actually a tuile, that is filled with marscapone ice cream flavored with candied orange peel and served with a scoop of ricotta ice cream with nuances of cinnamon. This was pretty damn awesome.More dessert...Except my conscience was screaming at me that my stomach's filled to capacity. And I have a plate of gianduja semifreddo that is staring straight at my face. Buh. I wish I had an extra stomach but I kept going and ate the generous slab of chocolate hazelnutty goodness. This semifreddo was chocolatey, dense, and it's bursting with buttery, nutty flavor from the hazelnut brittle sprinkled generously on top this slice of creaminess.After finishing that gut-busting, delicious meal, I had to run back to work since I took a generous hour and a half lunch!Address: Mia Dona 206 E 58th Street New York, NY 10022

I was not terribly impressed. We were rushed. The service staff was more concerned with getting my table out and ready for the next group. We asked 3 times for more bread. It finally came with our entrees. My wine glass remained empty even though there was a bottle at my table. The host who brought the bottle over from the bar when we finally were seated clearly saw that my glass was empty and just put the bottle on the table. I expect the wait staff to pour in a restaurant like this. My salad was over dressed. The diver scallops had too many flavors going on at once. The beat side dish was fair and the ramps were tough difficult to cut and chewy.The gelato was a let down. One was bitter, one was waxy, one was okay, but store bought is better. One guest had the meat loaf which was delicious. Prices are fair; wine was fine but this is yet another restaurant that is more hype than substance in my opinion. I don't know if I would give it a second chance.

This is one of the rare posts that is SHORT. Yes, I know I usually write Bible-length posts but for once I'm keeping it short because my mind's getting a bit burnt from writing the articles for Gotham Digest. I'm not complaining. I'm just tired. Also the time lapse from eating here was three weeks so my memory's dissipating about the food. I just hope you'll tolerate with this very short post.Whenever I'm at work, I usually chat online with Kathy and Robyn talking about various things about our lives and most of the time about food. Since Kathy (back nearly three or so weeks ago) was finally free from her former, hellish client and wanted to have lunch. All three of us talked back and forth what the heck we want to eat. Since Kathy's had a major craving for fried chicken and Robyn didn't want to trek out far from her office at Serious Eats, we decided on going to BBQ Chicken. I brought Helen along since she can do lunch with me from her internship at Cornell Hospital.BBQ ChickenWe ended up sharing the family pack which includes four tender, buttery biscuits and two sides.Platter of fried chicken...NOM.This platter of chicken was fried in olive oil, giving it a different flavor to any other fried chicken I've ever encountered. Perhaps fruitier? I'm not really sure. The chicken was crisp and crunchy while the meat was moist and tender. As we ate on, we're getting pretty stuffed and made Robyn eat the extra piece to the point that she's stuffed to this state.Spicy Creamed Corn & Pepper MunchersAs for the sides, we ordered a bowl of spicy creamed corn and a plate of pepper munchers. The corn was thick, creamy, and unexpectedly spicier than most of us have anticipated. But we appreciated the slight burn that it imparted to our palates to contrast the sweet corn.The pepper munchers were not remotely close to what any of us were expecting. I thought it would be small jalapeño peppers that's stuffed with cheese. But it's just a fried nugget of sorts that's filled with diced potatoes, jack cheese (at least it tasted like it) and specks of peppers.Once we're done, we're stuffed to the gills with fried food. Not exactly a nutritious meal but it was pretty tasty and relatively inexpensive. The problem is, I took another long lunch and I have to haul my ass back to work in the Upper East Side.Address: BBQ Chicken 232 7th Avenue New York, NY 10010

As some of you might know, I've done a few things for the upcoming debut of Gotham Digest. No, they're not ready yet until May. If they're up and running, I'll let you know and show some love and support to me and my freelancing employer!Frozen yogurt was the chosen topic by the assistant editor so I'm out to try out five different places for fro-yo. Since I wasn't able to stomach all of that. I invited Helen, Ariel, Seungmi, Julie, and Joo He on this fro-yo expedition of finding the best.THE WINNER!Since I'm not going to kill you with a ton of critiques (and I don't have the energy to write it), the best tasting one was Flurt. The pleasantly tart yogurt flavor lasted on my tongue for a good minute and the toppings were good but regret having the mango since it wasn't ripe enough.A bucket fro-yo from Red MangoI do like Red Mango's toppings (especially the mochi) but their yogurt flavor sucked. The tartness diminished within 2 seconds on the tongue.Forty Carrots' fro-yoBut one I should mention that is pretty good and they serve ginormous portions for a small is Forty Carrots in Bloomingdales. For five bucks, they will give you a small bucket of creamy yogurt and it will fill you up pretty well if you didn't have lunch like I did.That's it?!Other places weren't memorable. I did try Pinkberry for the first time, just for the sake of wanting to know what's so great about it. I would have never thought they would be so skimpy with the fro-yo. The flavors were decent at best. The tart flavors are kind of strange to me. I consider it the Starbucks of fro-yo - seriously overrated and they're on every block in Manhattan. We're being invaded by mediocrity.Moving on...after eating out all the fro-yo places most of us (as in Helen, Julie, and Seungmi) stuck around for dinner at Taïm. It ended up being our dinner spot just because it's cheap, filling (despite being stuffed with fro-yo), and most importantly, serving the tastiest falafels I've ever eaten in the city.FRIES!Helen and I split a large bowl of fries served with garlicy, saffron aioli. The fries were tasty, hot and nicely salted but they were soggy. If they were crisp, I would fall off the barstool and roll in a fit of happiness (or insanity, if you want) after biting into my first...SABICH!Sabich! ZOMG! That was insanely good albeit a messy sandwich. Stuffed within this pillowy, warm, chewy pita were slices of fried eggplant, sliced hard boiled egg, Israeli salad, and some amba, tahini, and other tasty stuff drizzled in this densely packed pocket. I never felt elated from eating a sandwich like this in a long while.Harissa Falafel SandwichHelen, Seungmi, and Julie all had the harissa falafel just because, I praised it so much while we're waiting on line to order the food. This was their first (and arguably, best) falafel sandwich they've eaten.Cold drinksI should mention that Helen and I tried their iced teas. She got the brown sugar lemonade which was sweet, lemony with slight hint of molasses from the brown sugar. My ginger-mint lemonade was refreshing and it's great with the heavy sabich.After dinner, we all walked over to our subway stations (around Union Square area), hugged each other for a farewell and bid each other goodnight. I passed out on the train ride home since I'm exhausted from walking around for the fro-yo and I'm in a food coma.Addresses: Flurt 284 3rd Avenue New York, NY 10010Pinkberry 7 W 32nd Street New York, NY 10001Red Mango 63 W 14th Street New York, NY 10011Taim 222 Waverly Place New York, NY 10014

I just sneaked in a photo while the employees were swamped with customers that afternoon so I took the photo of my meager portioned fro-yo.

WEEE! I finally ate here!After much delay due to odd circumstances and events in my life, I finally made it to Babbo! After hauling my butt from Tailor (as you read from the previous post) with Helen in tow, I've rushed over to Giulia and Robyn finding out the status of our endangered table. What happened during the time I was finishing up the pre-dinner at Tailor, Giulia called and left me with an urgent voicemail indicating that the maître d' will let our table go since the full group didn't show at the reserved time. When I spoke to her, she said I have to deal with the stubborn man and demands me to get the table stat, since she's starving.Finding out that our table is still safe, we've checked our coats and got escorted upstairs to the second floor away from the loud, harried diners of the ground floor.Interior photos of 2nd floorDespite the fact that the second floor is relatively quieter, it's still frazzled with a ton of lively conversation with groups of diners who are generally of an older age than all of us. Nevertheless, we're here for the highly touted food and good company.Plate of Chickpea Bruschetta and my ownWhile we were deciding what we want to eat, a server brought us some unremarkable bread, and a complimentary amuse, the chickpea bruschetta. These two-bite toasts were delicious - nutty and slightly tangy with the spices they were marinated in. After noshing our bruschetta we discussed at great length what the heck we all want to eat, decided, and ordered.Now here's our antipasti, also known as appetizers:Grilled OctopusHelen ordered the grilled octopus with “borlotti marinati” and spicy limoncello vinaigrette. I had grilled octopus before but I never had one quite like this. It was so tender and it doesn't even taste like seafood - more meat-like (chicken?) than anything else. The borlotti beans were creamy and acidic. This was delicious.Wild Arugula with ParmeseanGiulia had the wild arugula with Parmesan salad because she's following her Roman Catholic heritage of not eating meat on Fridays, which we all respected despite of our grumbles. It's a hefty portion of spicy, mustardy greens with a balsamic vinaigrette topped with large ribbons of Parmesan cheese. It's good but it's just a basic salad.Warm Lamb’s Tongue Vinaigrette with Chanterelles and a 3-Minute EggRobyn ordered the lamb's tongue vinaigrette under one of the many dishes I've mentioned that I heard or read that is tasty. I honestly never had tongue before since well, it sounds a bit...weird. Anyway, this was delicious! The tongue was served warm and it's so tender and silky from the poached egg Robyn mixed in. The vinaigrette cut through the gaminess of the tongue, and the chanterelles brought in a delicate, nutty, fruity flavor.Pig's Foot “Milanese” with Rice Beans and ArugulaI got myself the pig's foot \"Milanese\" mainly because I love pig's feet. My mom made on several occasions in my life stewed pig's feet and I loved it's fatty, gelatinous texture with pork flavor. Same thing applies to this dish except it's even better with the crisp, crunchy, deep-fried crust. Contrasting the heaviness of this dish was the tart, sun dried tomatoes, as well as the peppery arugula. The rice beans brought some substance and creaminess this dish. Gah, I love it...Mint Love Letters with Spicy Lamb SausageGiulia had planned on getting the mint love letters for a while because of its uniqueness of having mint and pasta together. The pasta was cooked al dente. The shredded, mint filling was a refreshing breath to the pasta. I don't exactly love this dish but it was different than any pasta dish I've encountered so far.Beef Cheek Ravioli with Crushed Squab Liver and Black TrufflesRobyn had the beef cheek ravioli. This was an ordinary sounding dish but it was outstanding. The perfectly cooked pasta filled with a smooth puree (practically) of beef that it feels like it's melting in my mouth. The squab liver was used for the sauce, which added richness to this dish.Chianti Stained Pappardelle with Wild Boar RaguKnowing Helen is not exactly the most adventurous eater, we recommended something relatively familiar for her dish of choice: chianti stained pappardelle. The chianti in the pasta gave it an earthy, slightly fruity depth. The boar ragu added heartiness and pleasant acidity to the dish.Lamb’s Brain “Francobolli” with Lemon and SageI gotten myself the lamb's brain \"francobolli\" because of the fact I like eating weird things. Ok, maybe not Anthony Bourdain's daringness but I like to try something different. Going back to the food... These \"postage stamps\" of pasta were intensely buttery and creamy. The al dente pasta was filled with ricotta cheese and lamb's brain - which I hoped to have more brain than cheese when I was eating them. It tasted mushroom-like with hints of sage and lemon from the sauce. It's nice but I want more brain.DuckAs we finished our pasta course, we felt quite full. I should be since I ate at Tailor an hour prior to this meal and Robyn was making \"Ughghgh...\" noises when the duck was placed before us to share. I have to say, the duck was really generously portioned. Four slices of duck breast meat and...There's MORE?!MORE! After each of us gotten our own slice of succulent duck meat, we unearthed the leg. OMG...we're all getting to the point of getting a stomach explosion. But since we don't like to waste food, Robyn got most of the duck and tossing about a fourth of the leg meat to my plate against my will to eat it. It's a very tasty duck - savory, sweet and acidic from the kumquat and wilted red cabbage, but I was heading toward a food coma.Plate of cookiesAfter having a few minutes to breathe and digest our food, we asked for the check since it's already 10 PM and we'll be kicked out off our table soon. So we could not have any dessert. But, the waitress presented us a plate of cookies: almond biscotti, chocolate baci cookies, and almond meringue cookies, along with our check. My favorite was the biscotti for its intense crispness and buttery, almond flavor. The baci was nice and chocolatey with a hint of almond. The meringue was nice but I was never a fan of meringue.That's the end of my evening of back-to-back high-end dining.Address: Babbo 110 Waverly Place New York, NY 10011

I ate at Babbo twice. Once with someone who knew the wine director and 2nd time on my own. The food and service was great the first time I ate there which is to be expected. The 2nd time the food was less spectacular and the service was downright awful mostly because they were trying to shove us out the door so fast. I do love the octopus app though.

Hi Tina,I had been to Babbo quite a few times so I had tried all the dishes you mentioned.  Like you I also like \"weird stuff\" like sweetbreads and other offals. (though in my mind they are not weird)  I had the exact same feeling when I had the lamb's brain francobolli - it didn't have enough brain flavor!  I supposed they didn't want to put too much in case it became too \"assertive\" to others, but I am with you, I want more brains!Seemed like you enjoyed your meal.  Thanks for the great review.

Kim: Ah, I hate it when you do repeat visits the service or food tanks a bit. But I am going there again around late May/early June with a larger group with Robyn.Marge: Offals and innards are tasty. Seriously, if Babbo or any restaurant wants to put in a \"weird\" animal part they might as well put more of it with a balance of other flavors.Thanks for reading!

Wonderful! i'd love to eat at Babbo!  great explanations with the dishes... and of course the pictures!  The octopus looked especially amazing. thanks for the share.

The restaurant looks beautiful - not cazy dim or super crowded. From just that one picture, it looks serene and spacious.I love pig's foot too. The only gripe i have against it is that it's labor intensive, but it looks like babbo has that solved. I never had lamb tongue but beef tongue is delicious. Are they similar?

All the dishes sound incredible. The lemon and sage flavors sound really good, though.

Oooh, Babbo! I've only eaten there once, a few years ago and it was super yum. Do you think the food is as good as some of the four (nytimes) star places?

Lance: Thanks for the compliment and thank you for reading!Dana: It is pretty but it's ridiculously crowded and hectic on the ground floor. Lots of people waiting for a table at the bar... @.@Christina: They were all tasty...except for the salad. That killed me when she ordered it.Danny: Babbo is different than other 4-star places and it does deserve its reputation of serving delicious food. Heck, I'm planning on going there next month with Robyn again!

TailorAfter reading a broad spectrum of reviews ever since Tailor, Sam Mason's establishment, spawned into the city's dining scene in SoHo, it stumbled a bit in reviews during its early stages and now transitioned to a young adult who has found its bearings with a unique identity - a bar that mixes innovative cocktails that also serves molecular gastronomic food like WD-50.The bar downstairsThe menuBeing the early bird that I am, I waited downstairs in the basement for my two guests, Helen and Ariel. Perusing their menu for a while I have been curious about their solid cocktails. I've inquired the waiter and he described it as dessert. As most of you might know, I love sweets, I do like alcohol despite of my low tolerance for it, and I do have a reason to celebrate since NY Magazine linked me for my Momofuku Ko post so it's a reason to go a bit all out. Even though, I'm going to Babbo (which will be another post) right after this pre-dinner.Solid CocktailsThe solid cocktails were interesting to look at and the idea of eating a cocktail instead of drinking it. The Ramos Gin Fizz Marshmallow was a tasty, soft marshmallow but it didn't have much of the cocktail's flavor. The Cuba Libre was in the form of gelatin with a sliver of dried lime was better with gentle tones of acidity and the sweetness of coke and rum. My favorite of the three was the White Russian since it's the sweetest with a good amount of alcohol tones running in the back due to the vodka and coffee liqueur. I also adored the textural contrast of the toasted, puffed rice cereal. This would be a dangerous thing to eat for breakfast every morning.The BazookaMore solids...Waiting for nearly half an hour or so since everyone managed to be so busy that day, everyone finally arrived and got seated upstairs. To start of the meal, Helen ordered herself a drink, the Bazooka. Ariel requested the solid cocktails.When the waitress poured Helen's Bazooka, the sweet bubblegum scent filled the air arguably intoxicating our senses and teasing us to take a sip of the vibrant, pink drink. Taking a small sip, this cocktail indeed tasted like bubblegum, it's sweet, and the bracing zing of alcohol from the vodka laced in this drink.Escabeche of Spanish Mackerel, Litchi Tapenade, Daikon, VerjusWhen Ariel and I ordered our food, actually Ariel did the majority of it since he inquired the waiter what's good and weird, taking nearly ten minutes to order, he requested to bring out almost all the dishes out. I'm just giving you the dish-by-dish breakdown.The escabeche of Spanish mackerel, litchi tapenade, daikon, and verjus was very good. The firm, fatty fish was pleasantly acidic and sweet with lightness from the tart foam. (The mackerel reminds me of eel but firmer, if you're thinking of how it tastes like). The carrots added a subtle sweetness and a slight crunch to something that's really silky and meaty.Coriander Fried Sweetbreads, Citrus Puree, Salsify, White BeerThis sweetbreads dish caught Ariel's eye on the menu because of the words \"white beer\" (he loves drinks); I want it because I love sweetbreads. The beer foam and the citrus puree's flavors were more appealing to me than the sweetbreads. The sweetbreads were fine but it didn't send me into happy delirium just because the sweetbreads was missing something extra perhaps salt?Veal, Marrow Beads, Parmesan Crumble, HuckleberryThe veal and marrow beads dish was a new addition to their menu and the waiter did seem to be enthusiastic of this dish so Ariel went for it. This was particularly lackluster. The veal did look like thin cut prosciutto but it didn't have much flavor but did have a delicate, creamy texture. The marrow beads just add on the richness with its fat but again, it lacked a sensational piquancy.Foie Gras, Peanut Butter, Cocoa, PearFoie gras is something Ariel loves wholeheartedly, arguably more than his alcohol. But somehow this dish made him feel indifferent, which was a surprise to me. I thought this dish was fine. The foie is mixed with peanut butter and cocoa, brining out a sweet, earthy depth to this dish. The pear and the thin sugar brittle that stabbed the foie accentuated the sweetness, almost making this dish tastes like dessert.Mango Ravioli, Black Rice Ice Cream, Cilantro, CoconutThen our final course was the dessert that attracted Ariel the most from the list of desserts (the Three on their menu). This dessert oozes mango flavor, literally, since the ravioli had a delicate outer shell that contains a concentrated mango puree. It still blends with savory elements from the outrageously velvety, pungent cilantro cream with the rich and chocolate-y black rice ice cream. The ice cream was chocolate-y but it had a nutty element from the toasted rice that topped it. It was a favorite between us.We're happy; Helen, Ariel, and I, respectivelyBean pateAs time became an issue for all of us (Ariel is going out with his buddies, while Helen and I were late for Babbo), we asked for the check - which the waiter brought out a few sweets for the table: coriander cotton candy and bean pate (think of pate de fruit but red bean flavored instead). The cotton candy did bring out the inner child in all of us. The bean pate was very different than anything I have eaten. It's like eating a firmer version of bean paste with a sugar coating.We bid Ariel goodnight, and Helen and I ran over to Babbo. We had to run due to the fact that they're threatening to give up my reserved table! More on this issue on the next post.Address: Tailor 525 Broome Street New York, NY 10013

Giulia: Yes, we did eat a lot because Ariel's HUNGRY and can't shut his mouth and decide what to order. Buh...but at least I tried a variety of dishes and get a taste of what's tasty.

The solid cocktails look really cool. So would you say that Tailor finally lives up to all the pre-opening hype that it had? He was grub street's favorite subject for a while...

I, too, found Tailor much more enjoyable than most reviews I read.  My meal 3 months ago was surprising and I'd definitely return - both the savory and (especially) dessert dishes were very good.  I might even go as far to say they are better than WD-50 - i think they at least win on tastiness.

Danny: The solid cocktails were pretty good. I guess the initial opening months, the reviews I've read were mixed, leaning toward the negative but now it's worth visiting.Chuck: I might agree with you that the savory food match or arguably exceeds WD-50. As for presentation of the food, I do like WD-50's more.Eat Me Outta Here: Yes, the cotton candy is fun to eat.

I swear I saw you at Cha An last Friday night. The person looked exactly like you but didn't had a camera ... so I figured no. Their tea collection and desserts are really good if you haven't been there ...Cha An

An Evening of Food with Helen: Restaurant Forte Baden Baden, Koryodang, and Shake Shack

Two weeks ago, Helen and I had a chicken craving. Since Helen's quite knowledgeable in the realm of Korean food (she's of Korean descent, in case you're wondering), she recommended either Bon Chon Chicken or Baden Baden. She told me she hasn't tried the latter and was curious about it, Restaurant Forte Baden Baden (that's whole name) was our dinner spot for the evening.It's a barIt seems popular with the Korean restaurants that serves good chicken dish, at least from what Helen describes them to me, are bars and it gets louder as the night goes on. The good thing was the fact that we arrived at 5:30, that the place was relatively quiet since there weren't many diners here and the hip-hop/pop music playing from the speakers weren't jacked up to the maximum volume (but did happen at the end of our dinner).Sweet, pickled daikonAfter we ordered our food, the only banchan of sorts was a small bowl of sweet, pickled daikon. These cubes of crunchy, sweet-sour veggies were tasty...and I'm getting hungry and restless for real food.CHICKEN!After waiting for nearly ten minutes, the Baden chicken finally came out and I'm more than ready to consume my quarter of chicken (we ordered the half portion of chicken). The chicken's skin was crisp while the meat was moist and nicely seasoned. I found out that it's first roasted in the oven then it's deep fried to accomplish that crunchy exterior. NOM NOM. The onion rings tasted like the frozen ones you find in your local supermarket, so it's nothing worth raving about.Hot chicken wingsThen our appetizer, hot chicken wings, arrived. Yes, strangely they went backwards with our order but it's an all-chicken dinner so it doesn't really matter to us. Anyway, the wings were mildly spicy since neither of us could handle the masochistic pain of intense peppery heat and we requested it to be that way. The wings had a nice crunchy exterior and the meat was still moist and tender with a subtle kick of peppers. It tastes fine but I'm not hitting an epiphany with them.A pile o' bonesEven though the dinner was generally good, not spectacular, I was hungry enough to eat it all. Since they don't serve desserts here and I'm want some kind of sweet, we paid the check and walked around K-town in the search for one.Koryodang's BunsWe walked a few doors from Baden Baden to Koryodang since I'm curious about this bakery for a while and having a friend who's familiar with it helps. But as I'm perusing their display cases of what mostly contains a lot of buns and a few cakes, I don't feel compelled to buy one since I wasn't craving bread of any form.Coffee Popsicle, CHOMPEDBut Helen wanted to get herself a coffee popsicle, which costs $1. It's inexpensive but when I took a bite of her treat, it's tastes like icy, slightly watered down, milky coffee. She likes it since she doesn't like the flavor of robust coffee (for your reference, she prefers Dunkin' Donuts over Joe's - a shame in my opinion).It's pretty...I still felt deprived of dessert after we're walking away from K-town and since Helen never went to Shake Shack and she's does have some stomach space for more sweets, so we walked down there.Almond Apricot CustardFortunately, we just wanted custard. The burger line was probably a twenty-five minute wait until it's our turn if we were to join in, while the custard line was a five minute wait. Since I wanted something different and Helen's indifferent with the custard flavor, we just went for the flavor of the day, almond apricot custard. The smooth, thick, creamy custard was nicely balanced between the nutty, slightly floral almond with the subtle tartness of the apricot. Mmmm...this was a good way to end our evening.Addresses: Restaurant Forte Baden Baden 28 W 32nd Street New York, NY 10001Koryodang 31 W 32nd Street New York, NY 10001Shake Shack Southeast corner of Madison Square Park

Lunch with a Gelato Virgin at Otto

***CONTENT
Lately, I've been on a run with eating out with new stomachs people recently, which is refreshing since Helen can't join me because she's all the way up at Columbia University for her rotation (in other words, internship for her pharmacy program). Robyn and Kathy are busy with work. So I met another reader, Drew, for lunch at Otto.Prior to meeting up with Drew, we exchanged emails in terms of what he's interested in trying. I found out he never ate gelato before. NEVER ate gelato?! That's...sad. Since we're here, this is the perfect spot to try out the best one, in my opinion for fabulous gelato.Otto's menu & InteriorWhen we met, we introduced ourselves, shook hands and asked for a table for two, we're escorted to the back area of the dining room where it's relatively packed with diners and the noise level is lively yet it's tolerable enough that we don't have to shout over each other. After talking over five minutes or so, getting acquainted to each other and discussing what is good here, we finally made our choices and ordered.Lardo BruschettaSince I love pork and I do like fat a lot (to a certain extent), I proposed to Drew that we should share the bruschetta of the day, the lardo bruschetta. How can you turn down lardo? The paper-thin, translucent sheets of pork fat covering the span of thick, crusty toasts. We're happy people despite spiking our cholesterol points up a bit.Prosciutto Arugula PizzaI told Drew that their pizza is good but nothing like famed DiFara's (I do admit I haven't eaten there yet but hearing a lot of praises about it). But he can't help it and ordered the prosciutto arugula pizza. The pizza's thin, slightly crisp and chewy crust was unique in terms of how it was cooked - griddled, not baked in an oven. The unique combination of toppings of tissue-thin slices of salty prosciutto ham, speckled with creamy fresh mozzarella, and barely wilted, bitter arugula in every bite was pretty good. But the thing is, it doesn't amaze me. It lacked an extra element that would take this pizza to extraordinary heights.Spaghetti alla CarbonaraI ordered the spaghetti alla carbonara since I prefer their pasta dishes more than their pizza. The al dente spaghetti meets the creamy, salty (from the pancetta), egg-y sauce was sensational to my mouth. Probably a little too much salt than I would like but it's still tasty. Drew liked my pasta more than his pizza, that I'm willing to give him a larger share since I want to save my stomach for...[points down]Olive Oil Coppetta, close upGELATO! I love Otto's gelato. I personally think it's the best in Manhattan. The one you see above is their signature olive oil coppetta. Basically it's a gelato sundae that has a large scoop or two of their dreamy, creamy, fruity olive oil gelato topped with lemon curd, candied kumquats, a tiny scoop of tangerine sorbet and fennel brittle, with a sprinkling of Maldon sea salt to kick up and unify the flavors like a harmonious symphony. Ahhh... I dream about this coppetta. In terms with Drew, the gelato virgin, he had multiple foodgasms for the entire span he had this coppetta in his possession (as you'll see below).He's no longer a gelato virginYay! I spread the word on gelato deliciousness... He told me recently that he took a friend of his to Otto and try to convert her to liking it, except she's not too fond of the flavor. Oh well...at least he tried.Rhubarb CoppettaThe other one we ordered (or more like me, since I chose them all) was rhubarb coppetta. I like to eat seasonal fruits or veggies whenever possible, so I took a chance at it since it did read interesting on the menu. The base flavor was Meyer lemon lavender gelato. Underneath it were cubes of semi-crunchy polenta cake and the entire concoction is topped off with a light and creamy Prosecco zabaglione, pistachios and poached rhubarb. What disappointed me was the fact that the rhubarb flavor wasn't really working out well with the other components. All I tasted was the strong zing of tartness from the stewed rhubarb initially, then it dissipated (after five seconds) to the other parts of the coppetta that were disparate that left my mind thinking, \"I want the olive oil coppetta back.\" Except Drew's eating the last bite as I was thinking about it.So, that's the end of our lunch. I have to haul my butt back to work, I left Drew to go to Joe since he's craving for caffeine and I do love their coffee, as most of you might know.I've been tagged... I've been tagged by another food blogger/pastry chef of the blog, Eat Me Outta Here whom I honestly don't recall meeting despite the fact she did say that I was there when she's cooking that day. Hmmm...I meet too many people that my mind can't fathom the myriad of faces I've encounter. I'm sorry!Just to go along with this game, here's the rules: Once you’ve been tagged, you have to write a blog with 5 weird, random, facts, habits or goals about yourself. At the end, choose 3 people to be tagged, list their names & why you tagged them. Don’t forget to leave them a comment saying “You’re it!” & to go read your blog. You cannot tag the person that tagged you, so since you’re not allowed to tag me back; let me know when you are done so I can go read YOUR weird/random/odd facts, habits and goals.1. I don't drink a lot. I think most of you knew that but I'm slowly submerging myself into wine and spirits recently or soon (depending upon when you're reading this and looking through my Flickr photos).2. Whenever I eat out, I plan out what I eat 90% of the time, including how much I spend. The remaining 10% is to give some leeway if something sounds more kick-ass like the day's special or something. Yes, I'm anal that way just because I don't have an unlimited food budget as I would like.3. My inner person is fat but trapped in a relatively average sized, petite body. Petite meaning I'm short, not tiny-skinny.4. Despite the fact I do eat a ton of food, I would go to food detox after the gluttonous period and try to run like crazy on the treadmill.5. Do agree with Helen's statement about me in terms of fooding/eating out: I go out because of food. Food is my social scene; not bars or clubs.I'm tagging:Address: Otto 1 5th Avenue New York, NY 10003

I've always thought that the chewy-ness of the kumquats doesn't go so well with the gelato. I much prefer the olive oil coppeta with strawberries.

I'm just trying to catch up everything that happened for the past several weeks since I'm planning to have more food outings for the coming weekends. More food porn for you, I guess and carpal tunnel syndrome for me in the next few hours. Buh...well, enjoy.Noodle Bar MenuNearly two weeks ago a reader of mine, Lynn, contacted me to have lunch since she's visiting NYC from her hometown, Washington DC. After exchanging e-mails for a while, we finally decided on eating at Momofuku Noodle Bar.After introducing ourselves and talking to each other a bit, we discussed about what should we eat. Lynn does consider herself a relatively adventurous eater but she never tried offals before. I highly recommended trying out their sweetbreads. For the sake of curiosity, we ordered the beef tongue since we never tried it before and we both lauded over Babbo's luscious lamb's tongue (she went to the latter five times) so we thought it won't be too off from it. We threw in the chicken wings just in case the tongue doesn't work out for her.CokeOnce we told our food order to our waiter, Lynn requested a bottle of Coke. I'm not into soda since it's basically carbonated water with tons of sugar. Hell, I haven't even drink that stuff over half my life since it's banned in my house nor do I cared for drinking it. Anyway, Lynn wanted it since she said fried stuff tastes awesome with Coke. I could imagine it but I don't want to inflate my calorie intake any further.Pork bun of AWESOMENESSI forgot to mention that we ordered the steamed pork buns. Since this is Lynn's first time to any of the Momofuku restaurants and she's not intending to eat at them for dinner during her stay, I told her that she must try their luscious pork buns since it's considered their signature dish and it's plainly delicious. She agreed but she's a bit conscientious about the fact that there's a lot of fat in it (from the pork belly). Hell, that woman is skinnier than me that I don't think eating one pork bun would cause her to bloat. What she particularly liked about the buns were the sweet hoisin sauce that was brushed on the warm, fluffy bun mingling with the luscious, salty, porky goodness.Smoked Chicken WingsWhen our smoked chicken wings arrived we were having slightly high hopes in regards to this dish since it's upscale chicken wings for $11. It should be very tasty. Except when we got our own wing and took a bite, we're disappointed. The wing was smoky, had a good amount of salt with a touch of acidity and heat from the chili flakes, and moist but it didn't blow our minds.Beef TongueThen we moved onto the beef tongue. When the server left it on the table, Lynn was freaking out a by the fact that they actually gave us a slab of tongue. Not delicate, thin slices like Babbo has. But the Noodle Bar does have some paper-thin slices of tongue that's hidden underneath the lightly dressed frisée lettuce, that tasted like pâte. Anyway, Lynn was being a good sport by actually eating a small piece from the slab of tongue. Predictably enough, she's turned off by the gaminess of it and I just ate the 98% of the tongue, while she'll eat the wafer-thin ones. The large portion of the tongue isn't that bad. The sharp, robust mustard does cut through the gaminess of relatively well. But I guess it's a subjective thing. I liked it, not loved it.Fried SweetbreadsAnd finally we're graced with one of my favorite dishes here, the bowl of fried sweetbreads. It does remind us of the popcorn chicken from KFC, but thankfully it doesn't taste remotely like one. These little bite-sized nuggets of deliciousness made me satisfied and Lynn a convert to this particular offal. In case you still haven't tried sweetbreads, or at least this kind, it tastes like creamy, tender meat but better because it's FRIED. So, I sort of have accomplished something out of this lunch besides knowing a new friend.Address: Momofuku Noodle Bar 171 1st Avenue New York, NY 10003

I have long been a fan of sweetbreads.  I first tried them at a very upscale French restaurant and will order them any time they are on the menu.  The preparation is far too elaborate for me to try at home and so I perceive them as a special \"going out to eat\" treat.  By the way, on the menu that you photographed it refers to \"Fried Veal Sweetbreads\" so I think that it what you were eating.  Aren't most restaurant menu sweetbreads from veal?  By the way, I really enjoy your adventurousness when it comes to eating.

Steve: Yes, sweetbreads are AWESOME!Yes, I made that mistake and will change it. I think I thought I ate pork since well, Momofuku usually have a TON of pork dishes. So, I thought it was the default.Oh, I think I'm losing my mind... @.@

I love your tale of lunch with Lynn! I've known her for 9 years now and you definitely lunched with the quintessential girl I know. Five trips to the latter... I’ll bet she had to unbutton her pants on the drive home! Isn't it amazing to see how much food fits in that small girl!?

I LOVE their fried sweetbreads, so good!
I like their pork buns too, but for me they don't taste the same between the two places, I prefer the one from the Ssam Bar.

I know I'm going to disappoint you with this post since it's about hanging out at Helen's place in Staten Island. If you hate me for writing about this you may turn your back at me and wait 'til I write another restaurant review. I'm sorry but we made tons of sweets from scratch that I think it's blog worthy.Earlier this month, I planned to have a baking day with Helen. You know, the girl who loves to take portraits of me with my camera and she eats out with me pretty often? In case you didn't know, she doesn't know how to cook or bake. Unless you consider cooking instant ramen cooking, which does not count at all in my world. Poor thing. So, I'm willing to dedicate at least a day just to give her a lesson or two on baking techniques since it's a Saturday that we're both free and we our baking theme was based on our obsession - CHOCOLATE.Staten Island Ferry?!Ferry interior & Statue of LibertyAround 9 AM, I managed to haul my butt from Queens (that's where I reside, in case you didn't know) all the way down to Battery Park so I could catch the Staten Island Ferry at 10. I wanted an early start since I had the eerie feeling that Helen forgotten to pick up a few things and we have to prepare stuff (like chopping two pounds of chocolate) in order to make stuff (cake, pudding, and brownies).Strangely, most of the people who were surrounding me in the photos you see above, were mainly tourists since they all scrambled to the windows when it's passing near the Statue of Liberty. The fifteen to twenty minute ride was surprisingly tranquil. The boat was relatively clean, roomy and it doesn't rock to the currents of the East River so I don't feel sea sick, not like I am sea sick but it's just for your reference.I'm getting close...Once I touched solid ground in the foreign borough of Staten Island, I called Helen to pick me up. When she's drove us back to her house, I thought Staten Island is a hybrid of Long Island and Queens. It's suburban, you can't go anywhere without a car, and real estate is relatively cheap compared to any other borough in New York City.When we finally got to her house, I met her adorable grandparents who were visiting from Korea and I took a brief tour around her place. As we started to prep the chocolate in her kitchen, letting Helen do some chopping, I've started reading through the recipes' ingredients out loud to check she has bought what we needed but she realized that there's no sugar in her house...NO SUGAR?!At Helen's place?! That's unheard of!Yes, the exclamations and capitalizations were necessary because if you hanged out with Helen long enough, you know she's a sugar freak. The only sweetener in her house was Equal and I will not allow any artificial sweetener touch the desserts or I will protest. Since she knew that and we're both getting hungry, she proposed eating lunch at a pizza place that she thought as an equivalent to John's Pizzeria and pick up some sugar on the way back.Goodfella'sHelen drove for ten minutes or so to Goodfella's. When we walked in, requesting for a table for two, the waiter told us that they were hosting a private party apologized and turned us away. We're both saddened with that message. Since I'm dying of starvation, I told her just drive us back to her home and re-heat her grandma's beef stew since I love delicious homemade food, even if it's leftovers. But Helen was determined to go to the other Goodfella's location that's in the southern part of Staten Island (another 25-minute drive) and lo and behold we have PIZZA.PIZZA!Ordered our pizza to-go since we have to drive back to the ferry to pick Giulia up to join us. While Helen's driving I'm eating half the personal sized, \"Old World\" cheese pizza. I was pleasantly surprised that the thin crust was quite tasty and it held the cheese and tomato sauce well. Actually, the cheese was the base and there's dollops of sauce around the pie so the crust wouldn't be soggy. The mozzarella cheese was creamy and a bit stringy at each bite that I was eating in content silence. Was it similar to John's? Not really. It lacked that charred flavor that John's has.We're cooking/baking...We picked up Giulia from the ferry (nearly ten minutes late) and went to the nearest supermarket to pick up a bag of sugar and some fresh mozzarella to snack on later. We finally started cooking the custard (which was the milk chocolate banana pudding, using this recipe) and I worked on the base of the bittersweet cloud cake (recipe here). Giulia was Helen's aid in terms of cooking the custard as well as working on her own food project - making salmon onigiri, which I'll talk about shortly.I'm plating the puddingFast forwarding about ten to fifteen minutes of cooking the custard to the desired consistency, I started to work on plating them. And it looks like this: [points down]Looks yummy...Once I was done plating, Helen was tempted to grab a spoon and dig in but thankfully, Giulia and I persuaded her not to by informing her that puddings and custards have to set up by cooling. Also letting her lick the spoon that scooped the pudding prevented her from doing so as well. Yes, we bribed her.Giulia's cooking salmonGiulia wanted to make bento boxes filled with salmon onigiri and vegetables for a friend of hers since she's planning to go to Brooklyn Botanical Gardens the following day to look at the cherry blossoms. Since she doesn't have a recipe, I can't tell you how much of each ingredient in there. All I could tell you is that there's soy sauce, salt, and black pepper that marinated the fish and cooked rice is always on hand in Helen's house. So, here's the photo splodge of how she shaped the onigiri free-handed (view from left to right for each row) with Helen's help on tearing up the nori:Giulia Making Salmon OnigiriWhen Giulia had made enough for her bentos and made a couple of extras for us to try, I was really amazed how delicious they were. The rice was warm, slightly sticky and firm on the outside. Soft and filled with a good amount of salmon in the middle. This three-bite onigiri certainly whet my appetite for more food.Silkworm Pupae?!While we're waiting for the cake and pudding to cool, Helen gave us a brief run-through of her pantry since she never really look at her pantry. Strangely enough, she plopped this can of silkworm pupae on the table before Giulia and I and she claimed that it's tasty. I would have tried it if I wasn't baking everything we've made so far. Actually looking through the interwebs, it's actually a popular Korean snack called beondegi. Is it really good? I won't know until I visit her house next time...Cooled cake and dumping the chocolate glazeThe cake has finally cooled so we made the chocolate glaze (which does look more like ganache than a glaze). I let Giulia take control of spreading on that silky, chocolate-y heaven on that cake.The cake's glazed...My slice vs. Helen's sliceWhen it's done, we've plated and I gilded the lily by adding whipped cream and white chocolate shavings on the cake. Hey, we're indulging today so might as well add another notch. Anyway, as you can see Helen was dying for a large piece or probably she's just plain hungry. The cake was light, almost cloud-like but it packed a heavy punch of chocolate with every silky bite. The problem is, after I was done eating my piece I started to feel full...and we didn't even eat real food yet!Cooling browniesWhile we were eating the cake, the brownies were getting cooled so we can cut them up into portions. Thankfully, I didn't overbake them since I don't like cake-y brownies. I want the fudge-y, decadent, in your face chocolate punch at every bite with walnuts flecked in them for textural contrast, which we did get from the recipe from the Essence of Chocolate. We're extremely happy albeit sugar and chocolate overloaded women. And we're just two-thirds through our chocolate dessert tasting.Fudge-y innardsStirring the stewHelen's grandmother started to join us in the kitchen by re-heating the beef stew she made a few days ago. As the stew boils away, the savory, meaty scent perfumed the entire kitchen that my stomach started to growl.Now you know how I feel, HelenWhile Helen was getting some kimchi for us, I managed to take this photo. For once, this is candid without her posing like she usually does. I just love the expression.Dinnertime!So, we started to set up the table with what normally would be a Korean meal - a bowl of rice, kimchi, and for our dinner, the beef stew.Beef fat = YUMMEHIf you understood why I love meat stews of any type (especially the ones with tough cuts of meat), you see why from that photo above. The luscious texture of melted collagen and fat makes the beef oh so tender and it melts in your mouth. Gah, I was in heaven. The kimichi was spicy enough that gave a pleasant burning sensation in my mouth. It was all delicious with the rice and beef stew that I wish I could borrow Helen's grandma for a day to make me a batch or two. I would ask for the recipe but she doesn't speak or understand English. Bummer.The last dessertNow we finally complete our overextended dessert flight with the milk chocolate banana pudding. The recipe worked really well. The chocolate didn't compete with the banana flavor and the wafer gave it a nice textural crunch to everything silky and smooth. We loved it but we're stuffed to the gills that we became lazy bums and just sat back and let our bodies digest the food. We discussed and regretted starting the desserts with the cake since that's the heaviest thing - we should have started with the pudding. But no worries, we managed to eat a little bit of everything.This was a good day of baking and cooking. It's fun and hell, I want to go back to Helen's place just for the sake of trying that can of silkworm pupae and have some more stew and kimchi.

Goodfellas is lousy pizza. From the look of the picture you were on Victory Blvd, just a block away from the best pizza on Staten Island Joe and Pats (which blows away Johns Pizza). Your friend should have taken you there!

Nougatine at JG and Revisiting Bouchon Bakery

About three weeks ago I had lunch with Ariel at Nougatine in Jean Georges before he ships himself trans-Atlantic for his month-long vacation. I would prefer Jean Georges proper, but they don't serve lunch on the weekends. Go figure.So GREEN...Nougatine's BarThe plus side about eating in the casual dining room, which is Nougatine, is that you're able to see a better view of Central Park right across the street. The service is still very attentive and prompt except what I've learned after listening to Jean Georges himself when I had lunch with two executive chefs, that Nougatine has their food cooked from a different kitchen and I heard the food is a bit inconsistent here.Ginger cocktailTo start things off for Ariel (after debating for five minutes and asked the waiter on his recommendation on which cocktail to pick), he finally chose the ginger cocktail. According to Ariel and the waiter, the cocktail was strong, interesting and well...good. I don't know since I don't really care for drinks that much.Moving on with the food...we ordered from the prix fixe menu, which was fairly easy to pick since there were only two choices per course and we added two extra dishes.First CoursesOur first courses were the spring garlic broth, soft poached egg, and dill and cucumber and mango salad, peekytoe crab, and lemongrass. I preferred the spring garlic broth over the salad. The broth is delicately flavored with garlic mixing that poached egg into that broth creates body from the gooey egg yolk. The enoki mushrooms added a subtle crunchy texture, still playing on that subtle flavors along with the dill. The salad, composed of arugula, chunks of cucumber and mango, topped off with a crab mixture, was good but not memorable.Chilled artichoke & Foie Gras BruleeMoving on to our second (a la carte) course, we had the chilled artichoke, mustard mayonnaise, chervil and lemon and our beloved foie gras brulee with pineapple-Meyer lemon jam. I ordered the artichoke because I had a craving for something seasonal. The artichoke was very simple and minimalist in terms of how it's cooked with a side of a creamy sauce. I was expecting more or interesting from this dish but obviously, this wasn't it.NOM!As for the foie gras brulee, I don't think I need to say more if you've been reading my blog for the past several months. Simply stating, we LOVE this dish. The crunchy, toasted brioche, topped with the fabulously rich foie gras encrusted with salt and sugar. The addition of the pineapple-Meyer lemon jam added a sweet-tart flavor to the party. The textures and flavors meld so wonderfully that it never ceases to please our palates. Ariel actually had a peculiar way of eating that foie gras - taking dime-sized bites to savor his share of the beloved liver.Our entreesGoing back to the prix fixe menu, we had our entrées: gently cooked hake, spicy aioli, zucchini and mint and grilled pork loin, spring onion gastrique, herbal ginger purée. My qualms with both of these entrées were the fact that they're a tad overcooked. The pork is fully cooked that it killed the texture of good quality meat. The hake has a similar situation where the fish's flesh was flaking (as you can see from the photo). They're great ingredients but somehow it's been ruined by cooking it or warming it for too long.DessertsWe finally reached the end of the meal with desserts. Ariel had the walnut financier, poached apples, red wine granite and I had the white chocolate parfait, rhubarb gel, crème fraîche sorbet. Neither dessert has taken my heart. It sounds more interesting on the menu than in person. Ariel's financier was good from the slightly bitter nuances from the walnut and the acidic, icy crystals of the granite but it just fizzled in terms of how excited my taste buds were. As for my white chocolate parfait, the parfait is creamy, albeit a tad too frozen, with the crème fraîche sorbet it made it creamier and a bit more interesting but the rhubarb didn't really come through. I felt disappointed on this course.After finishing our desserts and paid the check. Ariel and I hanged around the Time Warner Center since I was waiting for Kim's arrival since we're going to see the ballet later on the evening. Since Ariel was being a pal, we just perused the stuff at Hugo Boss and I finally took him to Bouchon Bakery. Yes, my go-to lunch place back in the days I was in school and it's his first time here.Boston Cream Donut & Strawberry Rhubarb MacaronSince Ariel was curious about my odd obsession with macarons, he wanted to try one since I keep dismissing Bouchon's as a decent macaron (and he never tried a macaron before) and the ginormous Boston Cream donut.InnardsIf you look at the macaron's innards shot closely, it's still relatively dry, chewy, needs more FILLING, and the rhubarb flavor needs to be amplified by a few notches. It's still not good, despite the fact I'm hearing so many people saying it's an awesome macaron. The donut was a dense gut bomb. The donut itself is heavy and tasted a bit oily. Then to layer on the heftiness of the entire concoction is the decent vanilla-specked custard. I felt like I ate a brick after eating my half; Ariel just plopped his remaining few bites and said in disgust \"I need a walk.\" and we have indeed. But what happened Bouchon ever since I graduated? Did I happen to stumble on a bad day? Or it's gone for the worse?Anyway, I did meet up with Kim after walking around Central Park with Ariel for a bit to burn off a microscopic fraction of what we ate.Addresses: Nougatine at Jean Georges 1 Central Park West New York, NY 10023Bouchon Bakery 10 Columbus Circle New York, NY 10019

I had dinner @ Nougatine awhile back and have to say it was a bit of a disappointment as well. I went in fully aware that it was a 'casual' offshoot of JG, yet, still, it didn't meet my expectations. Food was presented sloppily and I had to remind the waiter that he had missed a drink order for the table. I had a vegetarian dining companion and gave the restaurant 48 hours notice and they said that it would not be a problem. I even called 24 hours ahead just to remind them and re-confirm that I would need vegetarian options for the tasting/prix fixe. And of course, upon arrival, they had no clue what I was talking about and had to scramble. The food itself was...good. Not great, but good. Out of all the casual restaurant attempts from NY's fine dining masters(daniel boulud with bar boulud/db bistro, ramsay with maze, etc) Nougatine was the most disappointing.

Love the photos of the macaroons (and your use of the word \"innards\"). I am obsessed with those things! You must try the ones at Madeline's on 23rd Street!
thewanderingeater
2008-05-17 08:48:00
John: Wow, you had it worse than I did. I haven't tried db bistro yet...Traci: Thanks!As for Madeline, I've tried their macarons on two separate occasions and I found them a bit too mushy or wet. Meh. The only very good ones are from La Maison du Chocolat (in Rockefeller or the Upper East Side), where they fly in their macarons from Paris. Why can't Pierre Herme open a boutique here!

The macarons at Madelaine's on 23rd are indeed the best to be had anywhere.  They are pricey but worth the splurge.  Delicately crispy on the outside, moist and cakey within, and tons of flavor.  Take that, Keller.

Ha.  I did almost the same tour as you, except I hit Bouchon Bakery by day and ended up at Jean Georges by night!

Doug: We'll plan on it!Marie: Well, I hope you've read my comment before. But I'll give it a try again sometime soon.Ulterior Epicure: Ah. The thing is, I went to Nougatine not Jean Georges proper (which I would certainly LOVE to go again, on the latter). Different kitchens. Different staff. Food is inconsistent. I want JG! And yes, Keller can do so much better with the macarons.

First of all, I've been reading your wonderful blog for a couple of months but never got a chance to leave any comment.  I agree with you that Pierre Herme still has the best macarons.  In fact, I just finished 2 full day class with PH himself in Chicago a couple of days ago.  I tasted his macarons for the very first time and they blew away everything I've ever tasted in New York.  I'm going to post more about that once in a lifetime experience soon in my blog.

2008-05-22 20:52:00
Mitzy: First of all, thank you for finally commenting! Secondly, you had a two-day class with Pierre Herme himself?! I ENVY THEE! Yes, his macarons are swoon-worthy and it nearly made me cry when I ate them for the very first time. [Sighs] I want him to open a boutique in NYC dammit!

This particular post is merging two different outings on one place and that's the Little Owl. I decided to write about this place all in one shot since it develops a fuller picture on their lunches (and I do admit that I'm missing out on the dinner portion but I have yet to find a person or friend to eat there with me).On a side note, if you would like (and I know you want to after seeing the food porn two posts ago) to read my burgers and shakes article from Gotham Digest, I suggest you to click here.Back to the Little Owl. I remember reading from Grub Street's post that the Little Owl was serving lunch. To me, that's a huge deal since I can't find any friend who can and willing to eat there for dinner. Don't ask me why but it happens to be that way. Since Helen's interning nearby (always up for good food) and it's her last day there [insert wailing cry] we coordinated to have a bittersweet lunch there.The Lunch MenuReading the entire menu, everything sounds delicious but what I felt a bit carnivorous that day that I urged Helen to share their signature meatball sliders and a burger with me. We added something not as meat-intense by throwing in the ricotta cavatelli since she asked me, \"What is it?\" (It's a cylindrical-shaped pasta with ridges, by the way.) I ordered it for the sake of answering her question by seeing it and trying it.Bread & Olive OilAfter ordering our food, we're graced with plates of sliced bread and a fruity olive oil. The bread's fine but I do like the olive oil more.My Share of Ricotta Cavatelli & close upWe're technically served one long plate containing our shared appetizers (in other words, the kitchen split everything neatly for us) of the ricotta cavatelli and the sliders. Since I brought my macro lens only, you'll get individual shots. Anyway, the cavatelli was really good. The slightly tangy tomato broth infused with the salty, slightly smoky bacon bits made it a really tasty sauce that we mopped the remnants with our bread for this light, faintly chewy pasta. The fava beans add a slight crunch to the dish.Meatball SlidersThe meatball sliders were incredible. What's so memorable about them were the delicious garlic buns (as I found out from a friend of mine, Kathryn told me there's a recipe so you can make it at home).The buns tasted so foccacia-like that I was swooning over it like a madwoman. The meatballs were delicious and juicy that its juices were dripping down my hand. I wish I was motivated enough to cook. Baking is another story since I love sweets and tend to make them more often. I'm diverting from the subject here...After finishing our appetizers, we're presented with the cutest little things in the restaurant. No, I'm not talking about babies or pet-able animals. I'm talking about this [points down].Awww...!These tiny condiment bottles were given to us since we ordered the burger and our waiter asked if we would like any ketchup or mustard. I don't really mind having all of them, so we just said, \"We'll have each of them, on the side please.\" So, we're given these newborn condiments. Too cute.The BURGER (halved)Since we told our waiter from the beginning that we're splitting everything, the kitchen even halved our burger so cleanly that I would never get that kind of cut on my own. So, we get the innards shot of a medium-rare burger right from the start. Awesome. The plus is that tastes as good as it looks. Juicy burger that's well seasoned and the over the plethora of toppings that would spew out if you pile it on (as you see from Helen's incident here). Did I mentioned there's cheese and BACON in there. Yeah, that's an awesome burger. The spiced fries were a tad crisp and very well seasoned but I wished it's crispier.The checkWe ran out of time and have to skip dessert. Helen had to make an important phone call to her supervisor so, we really had to go back to work. We asked for the check and amusing to us, they use gently worn paperbacks as the check holder. It's cute and useful.Things around me at the barI went there on my own last week again since I was dying to try their dessert. The last time I went there with Helen the neighboring table had the most luscious looking crisp that my mind screamed \"I WANT!\" so I had to go back. I didn't have reservations during that time and I'm eating alone, I don't mind eating at the bar.Pork Cutlet; different viewsInnardsI ordered the pork cutlet since the waiter described this dish different from any other restaurant because it has scrambled eggs with it. Unusual as it sounded, I ordered it for the sake of curiosity. It tasted very good. The thin, breaded, fried pork cutlet was slightly crisp and very tender. The tomato sauce lightened the dish by bringing the tart, bright acidic flavors of the tomato. The scrambled eggs with what seems like romaine lettuce and chunks of potato work well, despite the fact it's a bit too wet due to the greens. Not bad but I like the burger more.Dessert MenuI finally got what I came here for DESSERT. I kind of wished I wasn't eating alone so I could have split desserts and get to taste more since I was indecisive between two or three desserts. But I made the decision of sticking with what I wanted in the first place, the crisp.Strawberry Rhubarb Crisp, close upThe good thing is that the kitchen was flexible with the gelato (it's from il laboratorio del gelato) flavor you want to top the crisp with, which I chose pistachio, since they ran out of vanilla. Eating the pistachio gelato alone, it tasted very good and buttery which is the essence of pistachio, but I wasn't too thrilled with the slightly gritty texture of the nut. As a whole, the crisp was delicious. I loved the sweet and tart flavors of the strawberry and rhubarb with the butteriness of the topping. Just don't let it sit out too long (like I have with taking a ton of photos of it) before the topping gets a bit mushy from the filling's moisture content.Sinatra has my checkI was full and I had to go back to work so I asked for my check. Again, it's presented with a paperback but it's about Frank Sinatra. I really like this idea.Address: Little Owl 90 Bedford Street New York, NY 10014

Hey Tina,
I had lunch at The Little Owl too when I was in New York! Lovely place... Will be blogging about it soon =)By the way, I'm linking you to my blog =)

So the thing to do is get the sliders as an app, then get the burger as an entree? :)

Su-Lin: Thanks for the compliment! As for Little Owl, you must go there!Danny: Sliders are a MUST. The burger in one seating if you're feeling carnivorous. But you must try either if you're going there more than one time or you can try both if you're going there with a friend or two.

Going to the Little Owl would be a stretch for me ( living in Louisiana) but awhile back I made the sliders from that article. I didn't make the garlic buns but everything else was a huge hit, this recipe is definitely a keeper :)

Forgive me for asking, but what's a \"slider\" - just a mini-burger? I only ever see them mentioned in American food blogs.Nice photos as always ( ^_^)b

I'm slowly getting back into the groove of writing my belated posts to you since I'm currently \"researching\" my article. In other words, eating stuff, taking photos, etc. So, here's food outing that occurred two weeks ago.Helen and I were chatting online during the morning at work, scheming what we want to eat for lunch. A while back I mentioned about a ramen place that opened in the East Village and I wanted to check it out. Since Helen loves noodles, she jumped at the chance and agreed to eat with me at Ippudo!Ippudo!Interior photosAs we're escorted to one of their communal tables, we sat down and soaked in the atmosphere of this place. It's quite chic for a noodle bar compared to Ramen Setagaya that I went to the past winter. The interior's done in black and red with a sprawling bamboo tree sculpture.\"Extras\" sign & MenuThe first thing that shot out from that table was the \"Extras\" sign that indicated that they serve braised pork belly. I don't know about you but if you ever had braised anything, it almost always tastes awesome and succulent. So we've split an order and we had our own bowl of ramen.PORK BELLEHWhen the pork belly arrived a minute before our ramen, I was shocked to find that the portion of pork belly was minuscule. I guess when they mean \"extra\" it's just a small side of a chunk of fatty pork goodness. When I ate my half, I craved for more.Helen's Kakara-men (bowl, picking up the ramen, and her spoon of food)As you have seen from that plodge of food porn above, that Helen's bowl of Kakara-men. Looks luscious, no? I didn't try her noodles since I have my own bowl of ramen. However, I did try her the broth. It's well seasoned, a bit thinner in comparison to mine (which I will talk about in a bit) and a tad spicier due to that little mound of hot pepper sauce on top. Not bad from the broth, I guess with her noodles, vegetables and seaweed it's pretty darn tasty.Bowl of Shiromaru NY & Shio ramenWhen I got my bowl of Shiromaru NY it looks relatively small compared to what I had at Ramen Setagaya and a lot less noodles since I see mostly broth with a thin slice of roast pork, scallions and what looks thinly sliced mushrooms on top. Anyway, when I took my spoon and tried a sip of the broth I was amazed how rich and silky it was (from the pork bones since it's tonkotsu soup), also it wasn't ridiculously salty like I had at Setagaya. Picking up my chopsticks and lifting the long strands of noodles, it looks promising. Taking a bite of the thin noodles they were firm, almost al dente. The cabbage that's in this bowl gave it a nice, sweet crunch and with the soup it created a wonderful flavor sensation in my mouth. Sure, the price tag of $13 is a bit much for a bowl of soup and noodles but it's New York.Pinisi's windowAfter Helen and I finished our ramen and paid the check, we wanted dessert. I remembered that Pinisi was close so we walked over there for dessert.Ooooh...cupcakesSince we're indecisive about what to get for dessert (except maybe have one of everything), we ended up getting our own cupcake. Helen gotten the red velvet cupcake and I gotten myself the tres leches cupcake since the girl who worked there recommended it and it sound different compared to any other bakery I've encountered. I remembered a while back Robyn touted their red velvet was awesome, and indeed it was when I tried Helen's. Soft, light and tender with their rich and slightly tart cream cheese frosting...man, I was happy. When I tried my tres leches cupcake, I thought it's fine. It's very moist because of the milks and the cake is tender but I'm not too fond of it. It tasted like it's missing something but I don't know what exactly.Addresses: Ippudo 65 Fourth Avenue New York, NY 10003Pinisi Bakery 128 East 4th Street New York, NY 10003

I think the \"extras\" are not meant to be a true side but it's like an additional topping to put in your ramen which kiiinda explains the small size. Ippudo still goes beyond what I would regular pay for ramen though.

Mike: Yeah...that's what I thought after getting that. But still for $3 I was expecting a little more, ya know?

Ippudo is a bit on the pricey side, but it's the most authentic bowl of noodles you'll get in Manhattan. I dunno what's happened over at Setagaya, but they've totally gone downhill from when they first opened. If you like braised pork belly and you ever feel like making the trip out to edgewater NJ, the Mitsuwa there has a Santoka Ramen (another japanese chain) inside that has an amazing tori-niku ramen (creamy pork).

I've been to Ippudo once, loved the broth but the noodles felt like they came right out of an instant noodle bag (I'm sure they are not, but looks and tastes like they do)

A friend and mine have been talking about going to Ippudo for months... literally! He lives near it and has been peeping in every day after work to see when it would open but we still haven't gone. This review really kick us to.And it's true. Ramen joints in the city charge an arm and a leg but wow, if you can find a good tonkotsu broth and noodles... it is worth it.Ethan - sounds like the noodles here are harder, just the way I like them - yum!

I've eaten at both Ippudo and Santoka Ramen at Mitsuwa and I think Ippudo is better since it is less greasy. It is tad expensive for Ramen though. Loved Ippudo's interior.

Hey Everyone! Probably most of you know that I'm writing for Gotham Digest recently and I've been busy with their stuff along with my day job, hence my long absence prior to the BBQ Chicken post before. So, I'm skipping a few things that you might have seen over the course of weeks that I've posted on my Flickr photostream since they're for Gotham Digest. You may look through my food porn about burgers and shakes and cupcakes just to wet your whistle on what I've been doing (I'll link those articles once they post).MACARONS!But...you may certainly read my macaron article that's posted there. Go and read it!Forty Carrots' YogurtAnd my fro-yo article's up, too (click here to read)! I urge you to go and visit Gotham Digest to support them and me (or I'll lose this gig).

Caracas FrappeMost of you who know me by now, I'm a huge sucker for desserts, especially anything chocolate-related. I dropped into La Maison du Chocolat during one of those dog days of summer on my lunch break and ordered the Caracas frappe.Mmmm...cream and chocolate shavingsAs you can tell, this (large) baby just screams decadence. What makes this frappe so delicious is their rich, dark chocolate Caracas ice cream, then gild the lily topping it with whipped cream and chocolate shavings. Then to add on more chocolate into your system, they add a tablet of chocolate on the side. ZOMG...I thought I was about to have a major sugar rush and my stomach's screaming \"No more...!\"Small macarons with a glass of waterBut I can't help the fact that I wholeheartedly love their macarons (it's the closest to Pierre Herme), I had to get a few. The flavors available that day were raspberry, coffee, and caramel. All were spot-on with the textures - a thin, crackly exterior with a slightly chewy, moist crumb. My personal favorite in terms of flavor was the caramel due to the nice salty punch with the burnt sugar flavor.After consuming all of that, I decided to walk around Midtown before I went back to my office.Strawberries 'n Cream Ice CreamA few days later (on the same week), I went downtown to Odeon, specifically trying out their ice cream from their ice cream cart and ordered a cup of strawberries n' cream. To keep this succinct, I was really disappointed. I kicked myself wondering why I trekked all they down from the Upper East Side for something this bad. It's icy and I didn't really taste that much strawberry despite seeing a ton of flecks in that scoop.Addresses: La Maison du Chocolat 30 Rockefeller Plaza New York, NY 10112Odeon Ice Cream Cart 145 W Broadway New York, NY 10013

Mitzy: The other \"flavor\" of the frappe would be their Guayquil, which is basically their signature chocolate flavor/blend that's not as potent as the one I had.

I stopped off at La Maison du Chocolat yesterday, albeit for their ice cream and macaroons. Wonderful stuff and perhaps the politest shop staff I have come across.

Bad ice cream sounds so saaad!  Why bother?  :(  The ice cream from Duane Park Cafe close to Odeon is SOOO GOOD.  Not sure if it's worth trekking down there, but you won't be disappointed.

I know it might be cold at that time of the year,
But I'll definitely stop by La Maison du Chocolat and give that Frappe a try!

Edit (6/26/08, 7:45 PM): No more people needed for Restaurant Week, thanks for reading though! But you may certainly suggest me places to eat in Toronto or Niagara Falls.____________________________________________________________________________________________________Edit (6/26/08): Ok, since some of you already responded a bit later than I've wanted/imagined, I made reservations to Gramercy Tavern, Eleven Madison Park, Del Posto, and Le Cirque.For the first two (Gramercy and EMP), I will not change it since these two places tend to be booked that I can't change it. As for Del Posto (it's lunch for this place), I'm still open to have people eat with me here. For Le Cirque, I'm not adding people since I have a few friends here and a reader.Thanks!____________________________________________________________________________________________________Hi Readers!As most of you (the local New Yorkers and the visiting foodies alike) are probably aware of Restaurant Week, during July 21-July 25 and July 28-August 1st. Yeah, I'm obsessed with this bi-annual event since it means cheaper expensive food. Contradictory, no?I know this is a long shot but I'm asking if any of you want to eat out with lunch or dinner with me at the following places:We are paying our own way, it's just for us to meet and to experience the food and the environs as well. If you're interested, just e-mail me.On a different note, I'm going to vacation during the 4th of July weekend. Well, a brief one to Niagara Falls and Toronto, driving all the way there from NYC. It's suicide driving for 8 1/2 hours, but it's cheaper than a train ticket. Anyway, do any of you have bakery or food suggestions that I should go to? I do have a few in mind but I just wanna hear your suggestions. This particular one, you should comment below, not send me an e-mail unless you feel like it, which I'm happy with either.

Kathyrn: I hear ya. Despite the fact that I didn't love my experience last year, I did want to try Cafe Boulud again. It helps that it's just a few blocks away from where I work.I have a like/dislike feelings with this year's list that I have a few repeats. :/

In Toronto I always go to E-On for Chinese
Recently went to a place called 5th Eementt and anothe place called Centro Restaurant & LoungeNiagara Falls...aside from the tourist traps there isn't much....

F. Pepper: I thought about that but I changed my mind since their menu is severely limited that it doesn't have anything close to what they normally serve or what they're known for.

Fooding in Park Slope, Brooklyn

***CONTENT
Three Saturdays ago I did have an intense fooding day since I went to the Big Apple BBQ 2008 with Giulia during the early afternoon (which I'm not going to write since everyone wrote about this eons ago and ate a lot more than I had, just Google it and you get a lot of hits) but you may look at my photos for that outing.As for the second leg of this fooding excursion, I finally went out to Brooklyn! Park Slope to be more specific. It's been ages since I went to this borough just because it's a two-hour commute from home in Queens. Even though I do admit that it's a 20-minute express subway ride from Union Square, so it ain't that bad.MiriamAriel and I discussed about going to Miriam many moons ago. I think six plus months at least since he brought up the idea of eating out to an Israeli restaurant. I've told in a melodramatic fashion that we have to eat there for brunch after he comes back from his three week Western European vacation before this idea will collect dust and it will be totally forgotten. So, he set it to this date and I've brought along Giulia and Helen.BurekasGiulia ordered the bureka just because it's something she (or I) ever had since it's not within our culture. The bureka was basically a dense pastry filled with feta cheese, sesame seeds, and seasonings. Tastes good but I wish I had better descriptions despite the fact it's technically my first bureka. The sides that came with this was two eggs with a tart, creamy pool of labneh.Croque MadameHelen ordered the croque madame, as you know it's different from the traditional version. What they made it a bit more Israeli-like is the use of egg-rich challah bread and topping it with eggs that Helen likes it done - scrambled. This is a bit more decadent and, in my personal opinion, tastes pretty damn good. I love the stringy, gooey Swiss cheese that stretches out from its former, larger self. Nom.Mediterranean Crispy DoughI ordered the Mediterranean crispy dough just because I was thinking how can anyone go wrong with something that's fried? Except the thing is, the dough was quite dense, greasy, and a bit bland for my liking until I slather on the spicy za'atar to cut the greasiness and make it a bit more interesting. What I do like the most is the fact my eggs are yolky that just adds on to the fat and cholesterol content a bit more. Yes, I did have a slight intention to spike up my cholesterol and triglycerides count that day.Israeli BreakfastAs for Ariel, he ordered the Israeli breakfast since the waitress did say it was the an Israeli breakfast with a twist. Whatever that meant, he ended up with two eggs with labneh, home fries, Israeli salad and pita. I didn't try his food since he was voracious and inhaled his food, so I didn't have a chance to get a bite but it looked good.The Chocolate RoomAfter we finished our late brunch (it ended around 4 PM), we walked across the street to The Chocolate Room for dessert.Chocolate stuff!I don't think I have ever seen that much chocolate coated, filled, or just plain chocolate in a while. It was a bit overwhelming that everyone, including myself, was indecisive about what to get. Eventually, Giulia gotten herself a small box of Knipschildt Chocolatier's bonbons for herself and her mom when she gets back home, since she had to leave early. As for the rest of us (as in Ariel, Helen, and I), we decided to stay and eat-in our desserts.A spoon of deliciousnessWhen we helped ourselves to a table, our waitress gave us a small sampling served, in a demitasse spoon, of chocolate sorbet. This little sampler whetted our appetites since it was so smooth, intensely chocolate-y, and deceptively creamy like ice cream that Helen thought it was chocolate ice cream.The Not HotDue to the sweltering, humid heat, Helen wanted the Not Hot, which is their version of an iced hot chocolate. This drink was quite good - not too sweet, not terribly icy, and the acidic aftertaste of the chocolate was an unexpected but welcoming flavor from something that was quite decadent.Chocolate éclair & InnardsSince none of us wanted the traditional desserts they have (think sundaes and chocolate cakes), Ariel wanted the day's special - chocolate éclair with orange caramel sauce. I had no preference since I didn't feel that hungry. The éclair was fine, nothing spectacular since the choux pastry was cold, like it just came out of the refrigerator but not soggy at least, and the vanilla custard filling was a bit lacking in the flavor department. The orange caramel was good, nothing much to write about. I do like it, but not as much as I would like to.Baked goods in Trios PommesJust because we're in Park Slope, I demanded proposed to Ariel and Helen that I want to go Trois Pommes Patisserie and they obliged to walk with me. I will never know when I'll come back here so I might as well stuff myself to the gills with whatever Park Slope can offer and remembering what I've read from Ed's review on their baked goods a while ago, this bakery sounded promising. Perusing whatever remains in their pastry cases during this late time of 6 PM, Ariel and I decided on the lemon meringue tart.Lemon Meringue TartI have to say this lemon meringue tart was quite phenomenal. The crust was buttery, just sweet and not at all soggy (maybe a bit tough cutting through it with a plastic fork but it's doable). The lemon filling was refreshingly tart and lemony with little touches of of sweetness from the torched meringue.Maple Latte & Iced CoffeeAfter eating all of this, we're all either sleepy from food coma or from the relentless heat or possibly a combination of both. Anyway, we walked back to practically to where we started from to Gorilla Coffee, which is a few doors away from Miriam. I needed an iced coffee, while Ariel was interested in their maple latte. The iced coffee tasted like a coffee version of Adderall. In other words, it's over-roasted coffee beans and it totally awaken my brain cells. As for Ariel's latte, he said it's pretty tasty from the maple flavor. Despite the fact I haven't tasted it, the looks of the latte is disappointing.Wide open (green) spaces in Prospect ParkOur guts are feeling pretty disgusting by now after eating brunch and dropping into two different desert spots, Ariel demanded insisted we walk from Park Slope all the way to Prospect Park in this intolerable heat when the heat index that day felt like 100+ degrees! But it was a good work out, not doubt about that...Addresses: Miriam 79 5th Avenue Brooklyn, NY 11217The Chocolate Room 86 5th Avenue Brooklyn, NY 11217Trois Pommes Patisserie 260 5th Avenue Brooklyn, NY 11215Gorilla Coffee 97 5th Avenue Brooklyn, NY 11217

I've never had Israeli food before so seeing your plates was really interesting. And that chocolate room looks really cute. The Not Hot looks like a nice chocolate milkshake, give or take lethal amounts of cream and milk.

Oh, excellent choices!  Miriam is a brunch favorite of mine.  I usually go with the Israeli Breakfast or the Shakshuka.  The Bureka is my husband's fav and probably the best value.We hit up the Chocolate Room fairly frequently as well.  I haven't had the eclair, but all of the other specials I've tried have been delicious.I've been wanting to try Trois Pommes for awhile.  After reading about your experience, I'm definitely going to check them out!

Amanda: Israeli food is tasty. I just need to eat more of this cuisine since I'm still not too familiar with it except for falafels (which I LOVE at Taim).The Not Hot is a chocolate shake but it's not as creamy.Brownie: Thanks! You should try Trois Pommes! It's a cute, neighborhood bakery, unlike most bakeries in NYC lack that homey character. (Magnolia doesn't count since you can't sit in and I don't like their cupcakes).

Man, I gotta get down to Miriams! It is ALWAYS packed on the weekends for brunch. Maybe I can go late or something... you know I've walked by it countless times in my 4 yrs in Park Slope and never went into that place. DOH!
thewanderingeater
2008-06-25 15:25:00
Danny: Go to Miriam! Their food is rustic and quite good.You should go there late, like I have met up with Ariel and my girl friends around 3:30, when it's practically empty. Well, then again it was INSANELY hot outside that weekend that I doubt anyone really wanted to be out...except for the beach.

This is so interesting to me as a reader b/c you're talking about being a tourist up the street from me. i live a few brownstones up from miriam and, to be honest, can't stand the wait every weekend for brunch so i've never been during that time.  But, there is obviously a reason why there's always lots of people waiting at 1PM on a sat. or sunday!  great pictures.  they have wonderful dinners - a bit skimpy w/ the portion sides for the price, but extremely delicious.great post!

2008-06-26 05:40:00
Jonathan: First off, I envy you from the get-go by living in a brownstone! (I like old school architecture.) Anyway, I guess you should go there really late since I went there 30-40 minutes before they end brunch.Thanks for the photos compliment!Becky: Go get some FOOD now!
How downtown (and are we talking about Manhattan?) are you?

TerroirSeveral weeks ago, I had a light dinner with a bunch of girl friends, Giulia, Helen, and Sarah at Terroir. We figured going out to a funky, affordable wine bar that won't break the bank since a few of us are still in school and we don't want to go broke for one night of fun.Menus and the detail of oneSince this place is basically a \"no reservations\" kind of place and it's early (about 5:45 pm) we walked in and sat toward the back of the bar. What amuses me were their menus - one-inch colored binders with individually, quirky, unique covers. It's graffiti on a binder but it's all about wine. Some were weird, a tad disturbing, and some had touches of cute (like a Hello Kitty sticker or two).InteriorAfter we ordered our wine, I realized something I haven't noticed at first glance was their kitchen. It's open to the bar and it's stuck on a tiny corner. What got my attention of its existence was the sound of sizzling hot oil, which made me turn my back and see this small setup.First round of wineOur waitress was nice enough to remind us about the time since their Happy Hour wine specials were about to expire when it's five minutes before 6 pm. We ordered what basically works for our own individual tastes. Giulia was feeling white wines, so she opted for the Grüner Veltliner. Sarah wanted the Asprino. I wanted ever since I saw the list, the Roter Elbling because it sounds so...weird and different. Helen was left to the red wine since everything else was taken and decided upon the Monastrell M3. We all liked or loved our wines when we took small sips out of each other's glasses. I adored my Elbling since it's quite acidic, nice amount of body and it looks like a rosé.Calamari SaladThe calamari salad was pretty good. I liked the bright, acidic, slightly spicy dressing on top of the tender ribbons of calamari and the crunchy, slightly smoky, crunchy chickpeas mingling together. The tiny sprigs of parsley mixed around this salad made it taste fresher and interesting. Giulia liked this salad a lot, with the exception of the squid's tentacles. The rest of us like this too but Helen's generally not too fond with beans.Beet risotto balls with Gorgonzola cheese & innardsThe beet risotto balls with Gorgonzola cheese looks pretty generic on the outside but after cracking it in half, you'll see a beautiful bright red-purple shade inside. The salty, pungent Gorgonzola is actually masking the beet more than complimenting. But it was tasty and I love the textures of crispy outside meets hot and creamy insides.Sage Leaves with lamb sausageAs for something meat related, we ate sage leaves with lamb sausage. These literally came out piping hot (as you can tell from the photo) with the scent of sage and fennel filled the air. These were pretty delicious. Crisp and nicely caramelized on the outside, meaty and juicy on the inside with a nice balance of lamb flavor with the spices.Duck ham paniniAs for something bit more filling, we ordered the duck ham panini with hen of the woods mushrooms and Taleggio cheese. This particular panini was unusual in terms of its combination - the salty duck ham, the earthy, slightly crisp mushrooms, meet with gooey, soft, creamy cheese. Mmmm...I liked this sandwich a lot.Second round of wineAfter we ate all of our food, the girls still wanted more alcohol, so they ordered by the glass except for me since my head felt a bit woozy from my Roter Elbling earlier. Sarah had the Goutorbe Brut, was a Champagne with clean apple and citrus flavors. I really liked that wine's dry characteristics. Giulia had Szigeti Brut which was a rich bodied, clean, sparkling from Austria. Helen thoroughly her pinot noir from California. It's light, fruity, a little bit dry and I tasted cherries. Since there was no dessert menu in sight and Giulia had to go home, we paid the check and Helen, Sarah and I left in the search for sweets.Dessert TruckMy dessert destination in mind was the Dessert Truck. I remembered liking their desserts the last time I went there several months ago and I remembered they have changed their menu slightly, so it's a good reason to go back.A Smooth Indulgence & The Special DessertsHopefully you know by now, Helen is a chocoholic so it's practically a no brainer that she ordered \"A Smooth Indulgence\" which is their chocolate bread pudding with vanilla crème anglaise. She's not daring enough to try with the bacon anglaise like Ariel had last time. It's a straightforward and familiar dessert that she likes and thoroughly enjoyed. She loves the decadently rich, thick and chocolate-y bread pudding.As for Sarah, she ordered (at that time) the Special, which was made of poached apple with almond cake, vanilla syrup, yogurt, and whipped cream. It's a much lighter alternative compared to Helen's. I liked the sweet-tartness of the slightly crisp apple meeting with the soft almond cake and tart yogurt.Who Cut the Cheese(cake)?As for me, I got the goat cheesecake. Did I ever tell you I'm a cheese head? Anyway, it read really interesting that you pair goat cheese with a rosemary caramel. My mind screamed, \"GET IT! It sounds AWESOME!\" Yeah, I wanted it pretty bad back then. This was definitely the best dessert I've eaten in a long while. The creamy, light, and slightly tart cheesecake plays along very well with the blackberry's sweet-tart flavor and the rosemary caramel brought an interesting herbal zing to the entire concoction. I was blown away by this magnificent dessert and it only cost me $5. It's inexpensive compared to what I would get in a fancy restaurant.Ooozing...Addresses: Terroir 413 E 12th St New York, NYDessert Truck University Pl & 8th St New York, NY

Giulia: I already anticipating small plates at Terroir so it wasn't a biggie for me.Janet: Terroir's pretty good. Their wine prices are very reasonable.Sweet & Saucy: Maybe start your own? Or find some entrepreneur or two to collaborate on this like the two guys from Dessert Truck?Cindy: I highly suggest you try Dessert Truck with a friend or two...unless you're willing to stomach as many sweets as you can without getting a sugar high.

A Cheap Eats Post - Taïm & Pio Pio

***CONTENT
During the last week of May I ate with a budget on mind since I'm eating with friends who are on a budget. I mean, these two meals definitely went under $20 per person. Interested? Read on...Our beveragesDuring the Friday afternoon when Drew and I met at Taïm for lunch. I think I've mentioned that it's my favorite falafel spot? If not, well, now you know! He got himself a can of Aranciata and I got their pear mint lemon smoothie. The smoothie was refreshing despite the fact it sounds like an odd combination. The mint and lemon juices made it tastier beyond pear since I don't like pear (the fruit itself) that much.Harissa FalafelI ended up getting myself the harissa falafel sandwich (my favorite of the three types they have) since I persuaded Drew to try the sabich. I gave Drew one of my falafel balls to try from my sandwich and he said, \"Whoa... It is dense and delicious.\" These fried balls of chickpea mash were definitely tasty and a bit spicy from the harissa. The Israeli salad that stuffed in this sandwich was fresh and tasty. But man, my stomach felt full by the time I finished that entire thing.The Glorious SabichBy the time Drew got his sabich, he was amazed or shocked about this thing looks so beautiful...and it has an egg. When he actually took a hearty bite out of his sabich, I asked him, \"What do you think?\" He said, \"It's really good.\" Then we went on to a conversation not food related, while we're eating, and he started interrupting our conversation with his comment on the sabich saying, \"Oh shit, this thing's insane! What did they put in there?\" I never thought anyone would say that out loud but uh, yeah...this sabich is something involved with divine intervention.FRIESTo complete our meal, Drew and I split the fries with saffron aioli. Somehow, I'm addicted to their saffron aioli even though I still want their fries to be crisper. But still, Drew gobbled the majority of the bowl since he's a starving guy and I'm getting stuffed by my falafel sandwich.Then later on several days later, I met up with Helen, Seungmi, and Juhee for dinner at a Peruvian-style restaurant, Pio Pio, that specializes in chicken. Since we're planning to attend the first showing of Hamlet in Theater in the Park, we planned to eat there since it's relatively close to where I work and well, Helen loves chicken of any style.For the past year, I've read Robyn's post on Gothamist on Pio Pio Salon about the Matador combo, I told everyone that we're getting this and save some stomach space since it's going to be a lot of food. And indeed, it was...CHICKENWhen all the food came out, the first thing that got Helen's attention was the chicken. This juicy, slightly crisp skinned chicken was delicious. I just wish they used a little bit less salt. I was surprised that they give you one whole chicken. For the four of us, this was more than enough to go around.The sides that went along with the chickenThe side dishes that came along with the chicken ranged from good to the range of \"we don't mind having more.\" The salchipapas and fries were arguably one of the favorites since we do love fries and the hot dogs were pretty good. I just wished the fries were crisper but it tasted good with the hot dog juices mingling with fried potato goodness. The rice and beans was the least liked since Helen and Juhee doesn't like these particular beans' texture and the rice wasn't really special to us. And finally, the salad was liked a lot since we're getting a heavy dose of fat and meat. We craved fiber and vitamins. The first thing eaten from that was the avocado (no surprise, since we love it's creamy but good for you fat).For $30 (pre-tax and tip), it's a cheap for a dinner in Manhattan. This amount food is possibly enough to satiate five people and you can go for dessert splurge somewhere else nearby (for example, Two Little Red Hens).Addresses: Taïm 222 Waverly Pl New York, NY 10014Pio Pio 1746 1st Avenue New York, NY 10128

PDTA few weeks ago, Helen and I went to PDT for a cocktail or two right after we're done with work. Normally, I would stay away from alcoholic drinks but I made an exception since I did like their drinks a lot nearly a year ago when I went to their Friends and Family night. Anyway, Helen was psyched to actually try it since I've been talking about this haute cocktail bar for months and she told me to take her there, so we finally did. Reading through their new spring menu and being pretty much indecisive about what the heck we want to drink, I talked to our bartender for the evening (I didn't catch his name, unfortunately) and asked him about what drinks go with what we like. I really was thinking about getting the Bizet but he said it's bitter, which I don't really want in my drink. So, I just let him take the wheel and surprise me. As for Helen, she gotten herself the Bee Sip, made of Chamomile infused Barsol Quebranta Pisco, Masumi “OkudenKantsukuri” sake, and Barenjager Honey Liqueur. In case you don't remember, this girl loves sugar and all things sweet.Badminton CupSo what my bartender made me was the Badminton Cup. It's quite tasty - since cucumber was the main note for this entire drink; a bit herbal-bitter and it doesn't taste that alcoholic (which I use with restraint since my head starts feeling a bit woozy up there ten minutes later). Helen didn't like it since she doesn't like or what she says, \"allergic\" to cucumbers.Bee SipAs for Helen's Bee Sip, I'm enchanted with the strong, clean smell of lemon since the zest was squeezed right before he served the drink then the scent of honey kicked in. When Helen took a sip of this, she was delighted about the fact it was sweet. I don't know since I still tasted the liquor but if I get past that, it does taste a bit sweet and floral like honey.The Wylie DogEarlier the week, when I was perusing the interwebs, I found out that PDT is serving the Wylie Dog that I told myself that I MUST try it when we get there. What appeals to me is the fried mayo! How can you go wrong with a fried fat? I know that sounds really wrong in terms of my health, but I can never make fried mayo on my own. I don't have that special chemical that Chef Wylie Dufresne of wd-50 uses, so this is a rare occasion that I could ever get my hands (or my mouth) in one.InnardsSo what's in this dog exactly? It's a fried hot dog with a log of breaded, fried mayo goodness, topped with shredded romaine lettuce, tomato molasses (Dufrense's answer to ketchup), and freeze dried onions. Sure, it sounds weird but it's ridiculously tasty. The texture of fried mayo what makes this dog so different - crisp on the outside meets warm, oozy fat coating your mouth with the hot dog and the sweet-tartness of the tomato molasses. Maybe a bit too much lettuce but I liked this dog.The MarinerI persuaded Helen to get one more drink so I could take photos of her with that drink and she also got a new haircut (probably my drink was getting to my head by then, hence my odd request/explanation). The problem was, we're truly stuck on what to get for her second drink. We asked our bartender what's considered \"sweet\" in the menu and he concocted and told us that this drink, The Mariner is the sweetest. When I took a sip, this definitely was sweeter than the Bee Sip she had a bit earlier. The pineapple juice did give the drink a big sugar kick, but the subtle, spicy smoky flavor from the smoked cardamom syrup cuts it a bit. It's nice and if you're really curious about her photos, a few came out well out of the ten or so I've probably have taken. I can't do much where the bar is really dark and I'm a bit tipsy...Interior of WildwoodSince it's nearing 7 PM, we had to head uptown to Wildwood Barbecue, meeting up with Robyn, Kathy, and for the first time, Danny. If you're inquiring about the people I'm having dinner with, yes, they're all food bloggers - except for Helen. Awww...The starters/sidesWe pretty much know what we wanted since Robyn have eaten here with her boss, the great Ed Levine of Serious Eats (read his review) and Danny has been here before too. Kathy's been dying to get her hands on the cornbread, Robyn liked their coleslaw. We thrown in the rubbed and fried chicken wings since Robyn mentioned that it's pretty awesome and from her photo during her first visit looks like it, too.I thought the cornbread was good but nothing to write home about. The wings were tasty but they don't look like the ones Robyn had before and she did say that they're different. Odd. As for the coleslaw, it was really good - fresh shredded cabbage with bits of sweet carrots that aren't drowning in dressing. I really loved their sweet potato fries. It's crisp on the outside and a bit soft on the inside that pervades the sweet essence of this tuber.BrisketThe brisket was really good. It's tender, moist, beefy and smoky. It also helps to have a thin layer of fat coating it.Beef Short RibThe beef short rib was insanely awesome. This rib was marbled with enough fat that it melts in your mouth. Succulent with a more intense flavor. This was my favorite from our dishes.Baby back ribsWhen it comes to our half-rack of baby back ribs, it's very tender and sweet. But it reminds me of a sweeter and obviously Americanized version of Chinese-style barbecue ribs.CaaakesAfter polishing off our meal, we ended our meal by ordering the entire dessert menu, which wasn't much since it's a carrot cake, a seven-layer chocolate fudge cake, and s'mores. The cakes were unexpectedly HUGE. I mean it's the size of a normal dessert plate. Of the two cakes, I prefered the carrot cake more since it's more interesting than the chocolate cake. The carrot cake was sweet, balanced with spices and the tart cream cheese frosting. I liked the toasted coconut flakes that topped it off. The chocolate cake was nice and decadent but it's just pure chocolate and they should ease off the sugar in the cake (the frosting wasn't too sweet by itself).A little pot of s'moresThe s'mores were presented in a small cast iron pot. How cute. In terms of the actual dessert. It was fine but the issue was the sugar. The s'more is similar to a fluffernutter except the peanut butter part is actually peanut brittle shards sprinkled on top of the chocolate coating.Addresses: PDT Bar 113 St. Mark's Place New York, NY 10009Wildwood Barbecue 225 Park Avenue South New York, NY 10003

Summer RW '08 - Eleven Madison Park - A Huge Improvement

When I ate lunch during Restaurant Week last year at Eleven Madison Park, I was underwhelmed. But this year, it's a significant improvement for the food.Pretty...As Giulia and I got seated in, I can't help but be in a moment of awe how everything seems elegant and refined - the high ceilings, large windows, and the tall floral centerpieces.Bread serviceEventually, we ordered our food and bread service rolls in. I have a penchant to get an olive roll no whenever I have the option to. I just love the salty bite of an olive but other than that, nothing too extraordinary about this roll.Heirloom Tomatoes with Big Eye Tuna and Olio VerdeGiulia's heirloom tomatoes with big eye tuna and olio verde is something she never tried before because she's not a tartare and sushi fan. She wanted to try it since it sounded tasty and interesting. When she took a bite, it made her a convert. The fresh, chewy-soft cubes of tuna (she would describe it as \"gelatin\") melds with the sweet tomatoes (that's the two cylindrical things on top) and the gentle floral bite from the lavender flowers that dots the top of this dish. It's really good. Probably I should make an attempt to re-create this dish at home and serve it to my raw fish haters.Sweetbread Ravioli and Its InnardsAs for my appetizer, the sweetbread ravioli with corn, lime, and chorizo, it was covered with a lot of foam (lime foam I presume?). Those of you who are familiar with Chef Humm's style, he likes foams. Anyway, the ravioli was cooked perfectly - the pasta was soft and eggy with the creamy sweetbread filling. The corn is under the ravioli; it sweetens and adds a crunch to the dish.Summer Squash RatatouilleMoving on to the main course, Giulia wanted the summer squash ratatouille with Parmesan shavings because of Ratatouille the movie. Don't tell me you haven't watched it. If you haven't I highly suggest you as a foodie, to go and rent that DVD!Anyway, her dish was really gorgeous with the vibrant colors of the oils drizzled on the plate contrasting the earthy tones of the vegetables. Flavor-wise, it was quite sweet from the heirloom tomatoes, zucchini (that's the container of this dish - technically the Rond de Nice variety), bell peppers, and onions. It tasted a bit heartier than what I expected in a ratatouille. Granted, I haven't eat enough ratatouille to tell you if it's spot-on or not.Colorado Lamb SausageAs for myself, I am somehow stuck on lamb mode since I gotten myself the Colorado lamb sausage with eggplant, tomato confit, and roasted garlic. I wouldn't have thought of this dish as something to eat for summer since it's quite hearty. The fluffy mound of creamy, buttery mashed potatoes added more heft to the delicately flavored lamb sausage. The eggplant puree that sits beside that sausage had a touch of zing - possibly cumin? A sliver of confitted tomato and a whole, unpeeled roasted garlic clove added a depth of sweetness to this dish.Glazed PeachesMoving on to dessert, Giulia is on a peach mode, ordering the glazed peaches with rosemary honey and mascarpone ice cream. What amazed me about this dessert was the herbal hit on my tongue when I took a bite of that peach. The mascarpone ice cream adds a creamy, tangy richness to the peach. It's touches upon the idea of sweet meets savory.Sheep’s Milk CheesecakeI went for the sheep's milk cheesecake with summer berries and lemon verbena. The cheesecake was delicately tangy, sweet and light. The berries and the sorbet added a sharp tartness to the dessert.This tied up the end of a good meal. The food was a lot better than what I've experienced a year ago. To compare this experience with Gramercy Tavern from two days ago, Gramercy rocked but it felt a bit chaotic with so many people around compared to EMP's tranquil atmosphere.Address: Eleven Madison Park 11 Madison Ave New York, NY 10010

hey i actually work at eleven madison park and we all are really glad you enjoyed your meal there
as for your comments, a few minor corrections
the flowers on top of the tuna tartar are actually basil flowers
and the eggplant on the lamb dish is seasoned with thyme, but you were right about the cumin, its in the sausage itself =)
once again, glad you enjoyed your meal and feel invited to check out our new tasting menu at night (its awesome!)
Gustavo

Summer Restaurant Week '08 - Gramercy Tavern, The Best RW Experience I've Had

***CONTENT
When it comes to Restaurant Week, I have learned, after participating nearly four years or so, not to have high expectations whenever I eat out at a RW restaurant. If I did, then I would be disappointed and felt robbed. But Gramery Tavern was the exception when I went there yesterday (Tuesday) afternoon with Giulia.When we arrived there five minutes prior to our reservation, there were a lot of older matrons who surrounded the front door. Strangely, the doors were locked and it seemed like they're not ready yet. Eventually around 12 PM, we we all lined up and go in to get seated.Gramercy Tavern: Menu & Table Settings, Interior shots As we got seated in the back, which is the dining room, it's relatively dim with a rustic yet refined decor. It's not the first time I've eaten here but that was years before Chef Michael Anthony cooked here. Anyway, Giulia and I were pretty excited with the food because of Chef Anthony's reputation and his cooking philosophy of using local, seasonal ingredients with straightforward cooking.Butter & Olive RollEventually we ordered and we're served with the usual bread and butter. The olive roll was one of the three options offered. The others were sliced sourdough and a crusty white roll.No Booze Today...Since I have to go back to work, I ordered a non-alcoholic drink that sounded interesting - the Ginger Swizzle, made of crushed ice, ginger beer, mint, and lime. It's refreshing and most importantly - cold. Giulia had the root beer from Abita. I didn't taste it, but she enjoyed it.Lamb PappardelleMy appetizer was the lamb pappardelle. The earthy flavors of the lamb melded so well with the wide, eggy ribbons of pasta. The olives provided bursts of briny-saltiness and the lemon confit and beet greens added more depth as well as highlight the lamb. I loved it.Calamari SaladGiulia's calamari and carrot salad felt like it's missing a sharp element. The calamari was finely chopped, making it a bit tender. The carrots adds sweetness and crunchiness and the toasted pignoli nuts mixed in there also adds a buttery crunch factor. But the preserved lemon vinaigrette didn't really shine much here. It's more of a muted flavor more so than brightening the salad.Grilled SirloinAs we rolled along to the main courses, Giulia's grilled sirloin with beef ravioli, snap peas, and eggplant was very good. The sirloin had a wonderful crisp, salty crust emphasizing the beefy flavors. The beef ravioli was buttery and creamy in both texture and flavor. But I loved the vegetables the most out of her entire dish. The snap peas were my obsession from her plate. OMG, they were very crisp and crunchy on the outside and it tasted like the pure essence of peas with sugar injected in it. Ok, the latter is not true but it was very sweet that my mind was going nuts for it.Braised Shoulder of LambThen I went for the lamb overload route that day since I don't want both of us having the same dish when we were ordering. The braised shoulder of lamb with broccoli and bok choy was succulent. The way the meat just breaks off so easily with a fork like it's been braised lovingly for hours (see the photo below). Oh...my palate was crying with joy. The vegetables were fresh and cooked well, but it didn't swoon me as much as those snap peas that Giulia had.It's so TENDERPeach PieEventually, we got to dessert. Giulia's peach pie with lemon verbena ice cream was very good. The sweet, buttery, crisp pâte sucre crust worked with the soft, juicy peach filling. The ice cream added an herbal-lemony tang to the sweet peach.Blackberry Streusel CakeMy blackberry sterusel cake with blackberry lime sherbert was simple yet so delicious. The cake was moist, densely dotted with whole sweet-tart blackberries, the streusel added a crunchy dimension, and the sherbert added a touch of creamy-tartness.Gift certificateAfter we paid our check, we were presented with a $24.07 gift certificate for a future lunch. This particular Restaurant Week experience is one of the best ones I've encountered out of the many years of eating. Service was gracious, the food was excellent, and this unexpected addition of this certificate. I have every intention of eating here again.Address: Gramercy Tavern 42 E 20th Street New York, NY 10003

Lunch Outings at Pampano Taqueria and BLT Burger

***CONTENT
For something more NYC-oriented for you, I had two lunch excursions during lunch last week - a solo outing to Pampano Taqueria and lunch with Drew at BLT Burger.For the past week, I had a major craving for guacamole and I can't explain why. I remembered from NYC Food Guy about his post, claiming that Pampano Taqueria serves the best pork and fish tacos in Midtown. Since it's not too far from where I work (it's just two subway stops and walk a few blocks), I dragged my butt over to the unmarked building with what seems like a good food court.TACOSI ended up getting what Food Guy said, the Chilorio and the Pescado tacos. They're pretty damn tasty. The chilorio taco was filled with Mexican-style pulled pork on a flour tortilla. I just topped it with their mildly hot green salsa to give it an extra kick of heat. The pescado was sautéed king fish on flour tortilla topped with napa cabbage and chipotle sauce. It's quite awesome but a tad too salty for my liking. The tortillas were very good and it doesn't fall apart whenever I bite.Chips and GuacamoleJust because I thought the two tacos won't fill me up...and I still wanted avocado for some reason, I ordered a side of guacamole and chips. The chips were basically deep-fried, sliced tortillas. I prefer it to be a tad less greasy. The guacamole on the other is mighty fine - chunks of smooth, creamy avocado with a small kick of heat.It's a pretty good lunch option in Midtown East. Now, I'm tempted to taste their other stuff...after Restaurant Week is over.BLT BurgerLast Friday, I met up with Drew for lunch at BLT Burger. It seems like whenever we do eat out together recently, he ends up choosing a burger place. Strange thing to notice but uh, I love burgers so I don't have any issues...unless my doctor tells me to cut my cholesterol intake for some reason.InteriorSince Drew was late, observing the diners surrounding me, they teeter more toward a higher male ratio than female diners. This is something I'll probably won't figure out. Anyway, as for the interior itself, it's relatively dark, tinned ceiling, with dark wooden chairs and tables. Also there's a large cow head at the back in the top center of the restaurant.Mocha Mudslide ShakeWhile I waited, I asked the waitress what flavors does she recommend for a shake? One of the few she mentioned was the mocha mudslide. I ordered it since I love coffee and chocolate. The Oreo cookies sounded interesting to me since I never had them in a shake. When I took a sip, this was relatively thick, not like Stand's incredible (but small) toasted marshmallow shake, and it's not that sweet either (which is a good thing in my book). The Oreo cookie on top is a nice touch except it was soggy when I ate it.Dr. PepperWhen Drew finally made it, he wanted a Dr. Pepper just because it's nostalgia for him and in his opinion, a burger goes well with it. I don't want to bother going through a long debate about drinking soda of some sort since it's something that I won't understand.BLT Burger and Waffles FriesDrew ordered the namesake BLT Burger with waffle fries just out of his curiosity if this burger is worth its name. I tried a bite of his burger, it exudes a ton of juice that just leaves a greasy trail down my hand. Besides the juiciness, the burger flavor isn't as awesome as Shake Shack's though. The bacon is a nice touch but it tasted like an afterthought. The lettuce and tomatoes were fresh but I still didn't feel swooned. As for his fries, they're light and crisp with soft creamy potato innards but it tasted like there's something missing...and I don't know what.Lamb Burger and Onion RingsMy lamb merguez burger, made of Colorado lamb, yogurt sauce, cucumber, olives, red onion, and tomato was quite spicy from the spices and slightly juicy. The yogurt sauce does cut the heat but it didn't really meld too well since it's a bit too tart for the burger. I like it with ketchup instead. My biggest tiff was that they cooked my burger to a medium! As you see below.InnardsBLT Burger has good burgers but I prefer eating Shake Shack's...that's if I'm willing to wait on the lengthy line for a burger. It's so much tastier and worth your money.Addresses: Pampano Taqueria 805 3rd Avenue New York, NY 10022BLT Burger 470 6th Avenue New York, NY 10011

I certainly agree with Pampano. Their tacos are some of the best in the city and perfectly proportioned, I miss being able to stroll down to the strange Cyrstal Pavillion basement floor.

[I suggest you get yourself something cold to drink or a bowl of ice cream, because this will be a long read...]On the second and last full day of staying in Canada, my family hauled our butts early in the morning (at 7 AM) from Niagara Falls to Toronto, which is pretty much an hour and a half drive. The night before we all tucked into our evening's slumber, I was pretty much coordinating when and where we're going to eat. I was freaking out over the fact that I want to do a pastry/bread tour in Toronto with my family since they never tried true artisanal bread and pastries on their own and I thought it's about time for me to show them what delicious carbs taste like.Thuet BakerySo the first stop was to Thuet Bakery. As I've spoken to Renee, about my bakery/patisserie tour through email, she told me that Thuet have really delicious bread.Oh, the temptation...After going up the stairs to the second floor, seeing the displays of baguettes, artisanal loaves, breakfast pastries and viennoiserie, I was dying of temptation to buy one of everything. But remembering the fact that we're going out for dinner later on, I have to save stomach space. I ended up buying a loaf of pretzel bread, focaccia, and a large loaf of speck, herbs and Yukon gold potato.Pretzel bread and its innardsWe munched on the pretzel bread first since it was the smallest and it's arguably one of the loaves that we can't save for the trip back to NYC. This pretzel loaf looks like a small baguette meets a pretzel. It does taste like a soft, fluffy-crumbed pretzel that's at room temp and it's not that salty either. I just wish I had mustard or meats to eat with this bread. I imagine it would be tastier in a sandwich form.Slice of focacciaThen we move onto the loaf of focaccia. Unfortunately, I don't have a photo of it as a whole since my mom requested it to be sliced since she has every intention of eating it right away once we get back into the car. When we took this loaf out of the bread bag, it's slightly soaked with olive oil - not a bad thing per se but it's unexpected. Anyway this was very good - soft and light crumbed with every nook and cranny permeated with fruity olive oil contrasted with the thin, crisp crust; topped with salty, briny olives, chopped sweet heirloom tomatoes, sprinkled with salty feta cheese. My family was in love with this bread that they wish I bought another loaf.Speck, herbs and Yukon gold potato loafAs for the speck, herbs, and Yukon gold potato loaf, we ate this when we came back to NYC. I might as well tell you this since we're talking about Thuet. When I reheated this in the oven for our dinner the day we came back from Toronto, this was amazing. When I used my serrated bread knife to cut into this hot loaf of bread, the medium-thick crust was flying all over the dinner table meeting with the soft, very moist crumb. The latter was somewhat surprising for what this loaf went through - sitting in a hot trunk of the car over the span of nearly a little more than 28 hours, it still tastes good. The salty bites of speck melds really well with the buttery, moist crumb with the aid of Yukon gold potatoes in that dense dough. My dad and I ate most of this since we LOVE crusty bread.Why can't I eat have them all?!Going back on track, after finishing our focaccia, we headed out to what I should think Toronto residents should call this street, Patisserie Street instead of Mount Pleasant Road. (That's just a random brainfart. Sorry.) There's quite a few patisseries within a few blocks of each other that a lot of sugar/carb heads of Toronto claim that are very delicious desserts.The two that I visited were Jules Café Patisserie and Celestin Bakery since they were a block or so away from each other. My family parked near Jules first and we took a peek inside to see what they have in store. And oh the sweets...I can't help myself but take photos of the delicious looking jewels. But my mom told me that the individual cakes didn't appeal to her. Poop.This is Celestin Cafe, not the bakery. Oops.So, we went onto Le Comptoir de Celestin.Bread samples & InteriorWe're greeted with a tray of bread samples, which my mom didn't hesitate trying the cheese quickbread (the one in the center).Macarons?The first thing that caught my eye after nibbling on the samples, were the macarons. Oh, how macarons have seduced me and imprinted on my brain forever. In case you haven't known by now, I'm obsessed with this darn French cookie. I can't get enough of it until I get a stomach ache. Anyway, I recalled my email exchanges with Renee and she told me since I've eaten a Pierre Herme macaron, there's nothing as remarkable as his little piece of Parisian heaven. Opting that out, I let my eyes wander for the focus of this portion of the trip, individual cakes.More carbs...Except looking at other things made me tempted to get more things than I could ever ingest on this trip.Box(es) of cakesBut thankfully, I've stayed in focus and bought my entire family individual cake slices of whatever flavor that fancied them.My mom's cake & a chomped viewMy mom wanted this chocolate praline cake with a wedge of fresh fig on top. I wish I knew the actual names of all of the cakes I bought, alas, I don't. This particular cake has a base layers of sponge cake (with chocolate and vanilla) and smoothed on with a creamy, crunchy layer of chocolate praline and fluffy chocolate buttercream. NOM. I wish I could eat the fig but there isn't enough for everyone.Dad's cakeMy dad's coffee opera cake looks tasty...except I didn't get to taste it since he didn't share it. He said it tasted similar to my mom's except it's intense coffee flavor instead of chocolate.Custard-y dessertWhen I ordered this custard-y dessert, I thought my brother wanted it since he pointed it out. But after eating about half of his dessert and we traded our desserts (mine is the millefeuille, seen below) for a bite, he wanted mine instead. His dessert reminds me of flan but filled with pears and lined with puff pastry. I don't know what's its name but it was good. But I liked mine more...Millefeuille, close up...which was the millefeuille filled with pistachio cream and strawberries. Layers of buttery, flaky, crisp puff pastry lined with pistachio pastry cream in between, topped with a large sweet strawberry. It's not too sweet and the puff pastry was really flaky, leaving a mess on my skirt. This was my favorite of the bunch.Photos of Downtown TorontoTo burn off the excess intake of carbs and fat, we went to Downtown Toronto and waddled around and act like tourists - taking pictures and whatnot for two hours, burning in the hot sun.Kim Moon Bakery & BunsEventually, we got tired and drove over to Chinatown. The main stop was to go to Kim Moon Bakery under Renee's enthusiastic recommendation for an old-school Chinese bakery. The problem is, my mom didn't feel the same way and we went across the street for a fairly new Chinese bakery that sells the old-school stuff.Chinese BakeryI think what made my mom feel compelled to go across the street to the indistinctly named, Chinese Bakery (unless it's different in Chinese, which I can't help since I'm illiterate in that department), was the cheap prices.Lots of stuffAs the crowds started to gather in this spot (it's not pictured but it was), we have to squeeze ourselves in line as we grabbed a tray and started to pick what looks tasty to us. Or at least something we don't normally encounter in NYC.Roll Cakes!My mom bought a few roll cakes for my dad since he loves this stuff. Actually, I think every Chinese/Asian kid has tasted this thing at least once in their life. They're light sponge cakes (with lots of different flavor options) lightly smeared with lightly sweetened whipped cream. My mom bought the coffee and a walnut cake. Vanilla doesn't float her boat.A box full o' buns and a bag o' fried stuffEventually we made our round of seeing everything this bakery has available to us and paid the goods. We ended up getting a box filled with couple of baked chicken buns, fried curry beef buns, baked red bean paste buns, and baked pork buns. As for the bag, we had a few ham sui gok and a dessert version of the former, that's filled with sweet black bean paste instead of the meat.In all, I was generally disappointed. The buns were mainly filled with air and little filling, a few looked and tasted underbaked. As for the fried black bean dumpling, it's actually the most decent thing of the entire purchase - crisp and still warm from the fryer and it had a good ratio of dough to filling.Allan Gardens: Interior and more botanical stuffThen we went to another garden to inspire my mom for more flowers to plant in her garden. The place itself was on the small side but it's crammed with a lot of exotic flowers and cacti.Quince's InteriorFinally, we headed over to Quince for dinner. During our stay, Toronto held a similar event to what NYC is doing right now for Restaurant Week, called Summerlicious. The difference between Toronto and NYC is that Toronto has an option of $25 or $35 for a three course dinner, instead of the default of $35 in NYC. My brother and I chose Quince since their menu seems tasty and when I scoured the Interwebs, Quince seems like a good choice for my family since it's casual but serves slightly upscale food.Bread basket and bean spreadThe bread basket is pretty much ordinary white rolls. The only difference is the hummus in replacement of butter. It's quite smooth and a bit piquant with the cumin in that mixture.AppetizersThe appetizers we ordered were the mixed seafood salad, potted salmon, lemon, tarragon pâté, and sweet carrot soup. My dad's salad was a ceviche except there were chunks of pickled vegetables. Tasted fine, nothing extraordinary. My mom and my brother each ordered the potted salmon pâté since they never tried it before. I think it's a good experience on their behalf since they never tried it but they complained it's too fatty and more toasts were needed. As for my carrot soup, this was not too shabby. It's sweet and filled with lots of fresh carrot flavor with a spicy kick from the chermoula sprinkled on top and a touch of creaminess from the crème fraîche.Main coursesAs for the mains, my dad ordered the chipotle, and ancho chili grilled pork loin, mom had the Moroccan spice rubbed Cornish hen, my brother had the grilled veal strip loin, and I stick with the vegetarian route, asparagus, roasted red pepper and tallegio filo parcel. The meats (as in the veal and the pork) were well cooked, except my dad thought initially his pork was a bit raw. What my parents always thought of cooking pork was to cook it all the way through, never slightly under before they will panic and nuke it in the microwave. Yes, it's the sad truth.The Moroccan Cornish hen was very moist and flavorful. What my mom loved about this was actually the side of lemon orzo salad. My vegetarian option was not what I imagined it would look like but in terms of flavor, it's not so bad, cheesy with fresh bites of vegetables, each peaking out on its own and meld well as a whole. I just wish they present it differently - as in a tad more fanciful than an egg roll.Desserts!Moving on to dessert, my dad strangely had chosen the meringue, lemon curd, and blueberry compote. I said strangely because my dad is not exactly health-minded nor gluttonous when it comes to dessert but this sounded waay too healthy. When he took a bite, he did regret it. He thought it was too dry because of the meringue, which he didn't inquire me what it was.As for my mom and brother, they had their own summer fruit crumble with honey crème fraîche. This is a very good simple dessert composed of pears, blackberries, and I think, strawberries. I had the raspberry semifredo with fresh raspberries and chocolate sauce. Again a very simple dessert, basically it's raspberry flavored ice cream that's shaped into a hemisphere with a whimsical pool of chocolate sauce and a few raspberries on the side. I'm not too thrilled with it but at least it's better than my dad's dessert.At the crack of dawn...Then we went back to our hotel that's very close to Toronto's airport and slept early since we have another long drive home to NYC. As you can see from the photo above, we left our room just at the crack of dawn.It was a Canadian blitz of a weekend excursion. Niagara Falls was nice to look at but I hate staying there. Toronto has a lot of good food options but since we're on a very restricted schedule, I can't sample a little bit of everything.Addresses: Thuet Bakery & Bistro 609 King Street West, Toronto, CanadaJules Café Patisserie 617 Mount Pleasant Road Toronto, CanadaLe Comptoir de Celestin 627 Mount Pleasant Road Toronto, CanadaKim Moon Bakery Dundas Street E Toronto, Canada\"Chinese Bakery\" 433 Dundas Street East Toronto, CanadaQuince Restaurant 2110 Yonge Street Toronto, Canada

Upstate NY/Canadian Weekend Trip - Day 1

***CONTENT
[Note: Not much of a food post but at least you know what I did in Upstate NY/Niagara Falls]My journey up North actually started at 2 AM when my entire family hauled our butts from bed, brewed really strong coffee and set out to upstate New York (by car) to go to our first destination - a farm. Yes, as an urbanite, it's almost a shock to me since I never seen so many rolling green hills and farm animals.NATUREBy the time we finally got to Murphy's Orchards, we parked out on the lot of paved dirt and set out walking to the a huge field of cherry trees.Trees...So we all started to walk to any tree that has good looking, sweet cherries (my family's not too fond of sour cherries and we can't bake within a few days) and picked them.They're bigAs you can see at the photo above of my brother's palm, these cherries ain't puny. They're large, sweet-tart and delicious. Sometimes I wish I could live on a farm for the sake of having very fresh fruits and veggies. Except I'm a lazy bum who wouldn't really want to do a lot of physical work.Crossing over the border, Vineyard, and HillebrandAfter getting burned by the scorching sun a bit and gotten several pounds of cherries, we all went back to the car and drove across the border to Canada. To go to Hillebrand Estates Winery in Niagara-on-the-Lake. I thought we're going to take a winery tour except the fact that my dad can't drink since he's mainly driving and I think you know by now I have a low alcohol tolerance. (The tour concludes with wine tastings.) But what we ended up doing was perusing their wine store and bought two bottles of wine to bring back home. What I learned was that Canada (or in Niagara only) doesn't charge sales tax on wine.Flowers (and a poisonous one)Then we schlepped ourselves over to Niagara Parks Botanical Garden. Personally, I don't care much for flowers but since my mom was strongly urging me to plot this into the GPS, I don't have a choice. She loves flowers, so this would make her happy. Of the few things I've encountered in that garden was the fact that they do publicly display poisonous flowers like the one you see above without any fence or glass to shield anyone off from potential death. And they grew some vegetables like soybean and eggplant...except it looks a bit dehydrated sitting out in the sun.Cole slaw and Bread BasketMy parents decided to have an early dinner. And I do mean early - as in 4 PM. Does that count as dinner? Anyway, since I've tried scouring the Interwebs for the past few weeks while planning on this vacation, I found out that Niagara Falls does not have good food. I searched through Chowhound that there's at least one decent place called Betty's Restaurant that has good fish and chips.My entire family ordered pretty much the same thing except different sides and I wanted something quasi-healthy (which I will tell you in a bit what they were). The coleslaw and rolls served to us were pretty darn good. The slaw isn't swimming in a ton of dressing and it's not too sweet. The rolls were slightly warmed, sweet and fluffy.Our foodAs you can see, most of my family ordered the seafood platter, which is composed of fried fish fillet, shrimp, and maybe a few small scallops and some type of starch on the side. The seafood was pretty crisp that it's fried crust shattered a bit when my family was cutting into their fish. As for my Halibut Creole; which is halibut baked with tomato, onion, and spice (whatever that means) served with potato - I opted for fries. I have to say, my dish was as good as it looks. Meaning, it's sloppy and it's not that tasty. The fish was too wet and overcooked, the tomatoes were pretty lifeless and the fries were soggy. I should have stuck with my family's choice.Strawberry Rhubarb PieWe move over to dessert. If you ask what they have for dessert? The only thing they have are pies. So, the flavors of the day were strawberry, rhubarb, strawberry rhubarb, coconut cream, lemon meringue, and a few others that I can't remember. So, my brother and my dad opted for strawberry rhubarb since they never eaten it before and I had the lemon meringue. My mom felt really full that she didn't want any dessert.The strawberry rhubarb pie was actually pretty good. The filling was sweet from the strawberries and a touch of bracing tartness from the rhubarb; nothing was too overwhelming. But the crust was a bit too soggy and not much flaky action going on. It ain't bad.Lemon MeringueAs for my humongous slice of lemon meringue pie, I have a similar qualm with the crust. In terms of flavor, it's fine - refreshingly tart and bright from the lemon but texturally, it's like eating lemon flavored jello. Not exactly what I want to eat when I'm eating pie. The meringue is good, nothing much to write about except it kind of acts like baked whipped cream in contrast to that gelatinous lemon filling.This diner is decent for what they serve despite being almost in the middle of nowhere and I prefer eating in a local diner than some overpriced franchise or restaurant that's moments away from the Falls.After finishing up and pay the check, we drove back and thankfully found parking and wait until nightfall for the illumination and fireworks. Patience is a virtue in order to get a good spot to see everything and take a decent picture of the event. So, just to get you in a slightly festive mode, here's a few of the photos I've taken.BOOM!The finale that lit up the night skyStay tuned for the food fest in Toronto...Addresses: Murphy's Orchards 2402 McClew Road Burt, NY 14028Hillebrand Estates Winery 1249 Niagara Stone Road ON L0S 1J0, CanadaBetty's Restaurant 8921 Sodom Road Niagara Falls, ON CA L2E 6S6

What was poisonous about the flowers? Like you couldn't touch them, or eat them?

Danny: According to another sign (I forgot to take a photo of it), says that we can't touch them. It's tempting to do it but I don't want to ruin my vacation by a trip to the emergency room.

I will complete the outing from two posts ago and will go to my Canadian weekend hopefully within a few days. Just bear with me about the latter; I'll post up in a few days...Pegu's entranceAfter having a surprisingly good meal at Kasadela an hour or so earlier, we walked from Alphabet City (it's the further eastern part of East Village) to Pegu Club. Possibly we're dying from dehydration or a heat stroke, we passed by their doors when we walked to this place. Pegu Club almost felt like it was an exclusive cocktail bar since the door doesn't have an address number - just their neon green lit and black insignia.Going up the stairsAs we entered the doors, we're on the foyer with the stairs leading up to the actual bar, and up the way we go...InteriorWhen we entered the bar, we're pretty surprised about how this place looks quite elegant - relatively dark with Asian touches to the decor, and spacious compared to PDT. We requested table seating since there's going to five of us - Giulia, Sophia, Beth, Helen, and I.Cocktail MenuReading through the menu, I was really indecisive since I don't really drink and most of the cocktails do sound good. So, I asked our waitress about a few of the drinks that sound interesting to me and eventually decided on the Ode to Ankarah. Onto the cocktail porn without much description...(yay! for you?)Pisco PunchGiulia ordered the Pisco Punch just because she loves sweet drinks and she doesn't want anything hard or strong for the moment since she's having issues with her stomach recently. Anyway, this was fruity, sweet, and I didn't really taste the bitter alcohol. This cocktail was a favorite amongst the ones we all ordered - and Giulia had a total of three rounds of this cocktail since she loved it so much.Aperol SunsetBeth had the Aperol Sunset which had the most prettiest bright orange color like the sunset. Very suitable for its name. I remembered this cocktail was good but I liked Giulia's more.Pegu Club Cocktail; close upHelen gotten herself the bar's namesake, the Pegu Club Cocktail. I remembered it was really grapefruit-y with a hint of smokiness. This doesn't exactly floated Helen's boat but she made it more bearable with the flavorings that were brought to our table, namely the sugar.Kill Devil...Sophia gotten herself the Kill Devil. I remembered reading the description of that drink reminded me of the Trident I had in PDT a year ago - very strong, bitter, and it tasted as deadly as it sounded. When I did take a sip of the Kill Devil, it confirmed what I thought. It's good but I think it's more of a masculine drink or someone who likes really strong drinks.Ode to AnkarahAs you knew earlier, I had the Ode to Ankarah. This cocktail was aesthetically pretty from the yellow drink contrasting the violet floating on top. The drink itself was intensely floral since the majority was made of elderflower liquer with a end note of grapefruit, which also has a flower-y note as well. It's nice but I guess flower-y drinks aren't for me but I finished it anyway.Close upI do like this cocktail bar a lot. It's more like a sophisticated lounge that I don't mind lingering for a while...that's if I had greater alcoholic tolerance.Address: Pegu Club 77 W Houston St New York, NY 10012

Pegu is my favorite place for drinks - anywhere.  The Jamaican Firefly is amazing - their home-made ginger beer incredible.  A friend and I drank over 20 of them over two nights!

Chuck: Really? I haven't experienced enough bars in my 22 years of living to know as well as the fact I can't drink that much before I'll go into hangover mode.Anyway, twenty drinks in two nights?! That's insane! I don't think I'll be able to move for a few days after that...

Wandering - there might be better bars, but I've never drank so many of one drink over a two night period.  I'm glad Pegu is not in SF!

Hideho! I'm actually writing this very short post just to say \"Hi!\" to you all from my hotel's public computer. Just to let you know, Niagara Falls' food does suck albeit expensive. Toronto's food scene is pretty darn good if you know where you going. Patisseries and bakeries that I dropped in were pretty awesome - that my family and I had a carb (and cream) fest of a breakfast. You have to stay tuned on that particular post in the coming week. Summerlicious, a Toronto version of NYC's Restaurant Week is not bad from where my family and I went for dinner.In all, the food experience was good despite driving all the way from NYC is hell. As for tomorrow, we have to wake up in the weee hours of the morning to haul our asses back to home so I can go back to work on Monday. BUH! Why can't vacations last longer?

Dinner (Not Drinking, for me at least) at Kasadela

MenusLast Friday, I went to Kasadela with Giulia, Beth, and Helen for a light dinner before we went to Pegu Club for drinks. Since Giulia and I had a craving for Japanese food on the moderately cheap side this was pretty much it and since this is an izakaya, anyone could start drinking prior to Pegu. On a side note, I would like to thank my reader, dbtron for e-mailing me this dinner tip.It ain't water...As we're deciding on the food, everyone else but me wanted to have sake with their dinner. Giulia had Kasadela's popular sake, the wakatake (seen on the top left), smooth and clean but I didn't taste much of the alcohol (which is a good thing in my perspective). Beth had the Kaori (seen on the top right) which was citrus-y, smooth and light. Helen wanted her sake gilded with gold leaf. I don't remember which one she ordered but it was mildly sweet.Clear rice noodsAfter taking minute sips of everyone's sake, just for the hell of curiosity and chatted for a bit, the harusame salad arrived. This dish was glorious in terms of being so light and refreshing for this hot, humid weather. The soft cellophane noodles was the backdrop of the lightness of the dish, contrasting with the crunchy, lightly pickled cucumbers and carrots, and the nutty sesame seeds. The sesame dressing that's pooled at the bottom of this dish was light as well but it tasted more pickled rather than nutty sesame flavor. Anyway, this was the best dish of the evening.Rock Shrimp DonburiThe rock shrimp donburi was quite good and the portion was on the larger side. The big bowl of rice that's topped with a thick layer of eggs, shrimp and sweet onions, topped off with nori and a sprinkling of scallions. It just needs a dash or two of the shichimi togarashi provided to give this dish a bit more life.Then we have two orders of chicken wings to share since it's really Giulia's main source of protein of the night since she's doesn't like shrimp and eel is tolerable food item, which I'll be talking about soon. The chicken wings was tasty in terms of having a good amount of spice from the cracked black pepper and sweetness from the sauce that coated the wings but the thing is, it's a bit dry and overcooked (as you'll see here).I love eel hence the reason why I ordered the eel donburi. Eel is awesome because of its fatty texture and that sweet-savory sauce that coats it. But man, as I'm trying to dig in eating this my stomach felt like it'll explode since I'm eating so much rice.So, if you want to drop in to Kasadela just go for their harusame salad and their sake. Other dishes depends on what you're craving for. Their food is a notch better than average, if you have to ask me.Next post will be brief since it's about cocktails at Pegu.Address: Kasadela 647 East 11th Street New York, NY 10009

A (Disappointing) Dinner at Cabrito

Cabrito's MenuCabrito, the former BarFry space where white tiles and the Japanese-inspired tempura that made this place, transformed into a loud, tequila-heavy bar that serves Mexican-inspired street food.I wanted to try Cabrito just because of the chef, David Schuttenberg, formerly of Fatty Crab. Back when I went to Fatty Crab the past fall for brunch and it quite good, so my hopes that he'll carry the similar quality of cooking to Mexican food here.The Happy Hour Crowd...When I arrived with three friends, Doug, Ariel, and Helen, the place was fairly packed with people during Happy Hour. Lots of people were drinking rather than actually cared for a sit-down dinner and care about the food.I'm surrounded by boozeBut since it was a hot day and it seems like everyone but me, wanted liquor and beer. Ariel got himself a shot of absinthe and the Sauzerac cocktail, and Doug and Helen got themselves a Corona beer with lime. I prefer to stay sober just because I could live with out booze and not get that \"buzz\" feeling that seems to appeal to a lot of people.CevicheWhen the shrimp and tamarind ceviche arrived, as the server indicated, the size is on the small side. It's meant to be shared but nevertheless, this dish appealed to us. The shrimp was fresh and soaked in the spicy flavor of the serrano chilies (which blew out my voice and made me tear for a minute since I accidentally ate its seed) and the tart tamarind water as the base of this marinade. The creamy chunks of avocado gave it some texture contrast to all the chewiness of the shrimp. It's good but I'm not swooned by it.Doug ordered himself two overpriced al carbon (skirt steak) tacos. I said overpriced, I meant the fact that you could get the same or better quality steak tacos elsewhere in the city. And they cost $5 a piece. I didn't taste them myself but he said that it's decent.Then came their namesake dish, the cabrito, which is a braised goat dish. I thought it tasted like pork rather than goat initially, but texturally it's not the same as pork. I think. I don't have much experience with goat meat so I can't tell you. Anyway, this was a good, flavorful dish except it's a bit too salty for my tastebuds. Just to note, the sour cream and the sweet-savory sauce that accompanied did cut the salt a bit. I just realized after viewing their menu again, we didn't get any flour tortillas with the dish. Argh.And finally arrived the jalapeño rellenos. Chile rellenos are traditionally stuffed with cheese or pork sausage picadillo, dipped in batter and it's fried. This dish however was obviously a different take on it. The pepper is fresh, stuffed with fluffy cod meat, raisins, pepitas and capers. I wasn't particularly thrilled with the flavor combination of this dish since nothing really stood out in my mind what was tasty.Overall, this dinner was very light since the portions of the dishes are on the small side and it's not worth what we paid for. But taking it from Ariel's side effects from his drinks, it must be good since he kind of lost his mind when he's calculating his tip.Address: Cabrito 50 Carmine Street New York, NY 10014

I felt the same way when I went there. Most of the food there tasted and seemed very \"cookbooky\" if that makes sense.LOL @ the tip part.

And I can forgive small portions (although that is a pet peeve of mine) if the flavors are right, but I ended up feeling pretty underwhelmed.

Baking a Birthday Cake and Eating at Helen's House

Here's all the work put into itTwo weeks ago I baked a cake for my younger brother's 21st birthday. Yeah, he's all grown up now and I feel kinda old just thinking back how little he was.[Sniffles] Anyway, my mom wanted me to bake him a \"sophisticated\" cake just because he's turning the milestone age of 21. So, I picked a few cookbooks off of my bookshelf and gave him to peruse and pick a cake he liked. He ended up liking a few recipes from La Maison du Chocolat's book (he's got good taste, no?) and I helped him narrow it down in terms of aesthetics. Actually, all the photos in LMDC's book is food porn so it's hard to pick something but we settled for a bit of a challenging cake, the Lemon-Chocolate Almond Cake. I said \"challenging\" because it has four components to create the entire cake: the chocolate-almond cake, the chocolate cream, lemon cream, and the glaze. It does sound easy but it's a pain to let it wait to sit in the refrigerator to set. Also, working full-time takes away time for cooking or baking during the weekdays.The lemons are kissingPouring the creamNevertheless, I pursued and planned what to make. The first evening I started to make the base of the lemon cream and chocolate cream. Except, I ran into a few blips when I'm working with the chocolate, as well as my stupidity as I'm going along with the recipe. But all is fine and dandy when I worked out the kinks and it looks like that smooth, fluffy thing you see below.Mmmm...creamyAlso, it doesn't help when my local grocery stores don't sell almond flour. I ended up getting blanched almonds and grind them up - in humid weather with a blender. Not a good combination since everything's sticking to the walls and bottom of the container, threatening to become almond butter. [Note to self: Don't make almond flour in humid weather conditions.]Oops...The last major mistake I did was not using a ruler to divide the cake into thirds evenly. I trimmed out too much that I lost probably 1/8th of the cake. But nothing went to waste, I fed them to my parents since they kept circling around me like a hungry pet, waiting for something to fall on the ground - except they're not going to eat off the ground, just pick up the crumbs left on the tray.Constructing the cakeThe good thing was that building the cake went well. Giving the exception that it's actually tilted when I look at my slice of cake. But my brother said to me, \"It doesn't matter how it looks. As long as it tastes good, I'm happy.\" It tasted magnificent - intense, creamy chocolate with a hint of brightness and acidity from the lemon cream. My mom can't stop eating that cake the entire night that I have to guard the refrigerator for a few hours.Going over the VerrazanoI went back to Helen's house again but not for the intense chocolate baking that we did last time. After baking my brother's birthday cake, I don't want to touch chocolate. Hell, I would try to persuade Helen not to do anything chocolate-y. Thankfully, she's just craving for profiteroles ever since she tried a few from Balthazar Bakery.Making non-chocolate dessertsWhen we got to her house (meeting Helen's younger sister and eventually our mutual friend, Joohee), I started to make the Honey-Apricot Parfait With Greek Yogurt and Walnuts that I read from The New York Times several weeks ago. The two things that I love about it were: no cooking and it's very seasonal. It's so easy to put together and it tastes delightful - sweet and tart from the macerated apricots and honey, creamy and tangy from the yogurt (I used Fage), and the crunchy toasted, slightly bitter walnuts. So NOM and pretty.Honey-Apricot Parfait With Greek Yogurt, and WalnutsThis was our starter for our late lunch. Helen planned on serving cold soba noodles her way since I never really ate it before. I'm usually partial to hot noodle dishes but since it's the summer, why not give it a try?Sparkling Sake...Before we started to eat, I brought out a pack of sparkling sake by Sake2Me to share amongst us. What we did was have a sip of each from a glass (seen here for an idea). The sakes were very smooth and effervescent (for obvious reasons and it's the premium junmai grade). Of the four fruit flavors, I liked the yuzu citrus the most since it's sweeter. The Asian pear was second. I did enjoy the subtle sweetness of the pear.I bought this just because I remember liking the cold sake I tried in Kasadela. The safety net is that I'm at a close friend's place that I can take a nap if I feel drunk. Thankfully, it didn't happen. I just felt a tiny bit buzzed after drinking the entire bottle myself, which is a remarkable thing in itself.Food styled by Joohee...When we finally got to eating, Joohee was being the finicky person (like me) to make the food look pretty. After cooling off the soba noodles, she balled them up into portions and make it look better than a big, messy pile that Helen wanted to do.My bowl of noodsSo this bowl of cold soba was pretty much a mixture of soba sauce that's similar to soy sauce (which I don't know the English name of), wasabi paste, and finely grated daikon. The whole thing tasted so good that I ate so much of it 'til my belly can't take it anymore. It's chewy, spicy, bitter and salty all in each bite. I would eat more but I need to save some room for the profiteroles I'm going to make.Making a spicy salmon roll (or cone)Just when I felt like I'm about to hit food coma, Helen started to whip up some spicy salmon cones. I said cones since she doesn't know how to make a maki form, especially the part when she has to cut it. So...we have to live with a big, stuffed seaweed cone full of soft, warm rice, spicy salmon (which she was a bit too liberal with the mayonnaise and sriracha sauce), avocado, and salmon roe. It was very tasty but after eating one, I felt like I'm going to keel over and die!It's getting poofySitting, chatting, and cleaning up helps out the belly aching a bit that made me motivated to start baking the profiteroles. I made the chocolate cream portion by boiling the milk, sugar, cocoa powder and cornstarch (I think?) to create a custard-like filling but thicker.While it's cooling, I made the pâte à choux. It sounds fancy and all but this is the easiest dessert to bake, in my opinion. Melt your butter, dump in flour, a little bit of sugar and salt, and mix like crazy. Turn off the fire, then crack an egg and a yolk and still mix constantly to prevent scrambled eggs, and finally into a pastry bag with a medium, plain tip. From there, you just squeeze the dough about the size of a ping-pong ball onto a greased or lined baking sheet and bake. That's it. The finished product looks like this: [points down]Ooooh...Then get yourself some decent chocolate to make a ganache and let it cool slightly. Fill the choux with the chocolate cream and dip them into the chocolate pool of yummy. And you get a plate full of these babies.MMMM...Or you can do the food porn way of getting a cute little gravy bowl like I have and fill it with the ganache and set aside some filled choux and do this:You know you want it...So that concludes the weekend of baking. I know it isn't fooding but hell, it's food and most importantly, DESSERT.If you want me to post the recipe (if there's a reasonable amount of response to this), I'll post the recipe for the lemon-chocolate cake or the chocolate profiteroles. I'm just lazy to type out the recipes.

That is some serious food porn! The profiteroles look amazing! mmm.. chocolatey. Is pâte à choux do-able for a baking newbie?

Elle: Thank you!Teddy: Please refer to this post for the (baked) recipes.Danny: Thanks!
Pâte à choux is very do-able! You just heat up everything but the flour and eggs. Once it reaches boilage, just dump the flour and mix continuously (to prevent lumps), after that you add your egg mixture and you really have to stir at this point (before you get scrambled eggs, not what you exactly want...). Then you dump the contents of your choux mixture into a piping bag or a ziploc bag (with a corner cut off) fitted with a piping tip then squeeze onto a greased and/or lined baking sheet. It's a very easy dessert.

Our Own Version of the Tasting Menu at Gramercy Tavern

***CONTENT
If you remember several weeks ago (or several posts ago), I went to Gramercy Tavern with Giulia for Restaurant Week and we received gift certificates for a future lunch. We set a date on when to return and keep perusing their website if the dining room menu changes after RW. But, they didn't. They kept the same dishes but put in a la carte prices which defeats our purpose of trying out Gramercy Tavern's full potential. So, we opted for the tavern room and we created our own tasting menu by splitting everything we're going to order.The Tavern Room & BarThe tavern room is casual, handsome, dark wood interior and exposed wooden beams, with the splash of vibrant colors along the top of the walls surrounding this room. It reminds me of an interior of a country home but it's classier with a touch of funk from the colors. Me like.Mmm...tangy fermented carbsAfter we ordered, we gotten the usual salt, bread and butter. The difference between here and the dining room is that you don't have a choice. All you get is a slice of tangy multi-grain bread. It's tasty but I don't mind getting that small olive roll from the dining room.Eventually, our appetizers arrived. Did I mention we ordered three of them?Our appsAs you can tell, we went pretty heavy on the cold fatty meats - the duck terrine and foie gras torchon. The duck was delicious. I particularly loved the sweet dried figs that were nestled in the center of this terrine, as well as the pistachio and onion marmalade, which brought sweetness and buttery flavors. The foie gras was smooth and buttery, while the accompaniment of the strawberry rhubarb chutney was the surprising element. We normally think of strawberry and rhubarb as the normal pie or cobbler filling that is kind of boring to us, but they took it to another level by using mint, which made it so different yet familiar.We balanced it out the meat-centric first courses with the amazing heirloom cauliflower. The sweet, caramelized cauliflower (on the bottom) is cooked perfectly and the toppings of the crunchy almonds, briny capers and the gentle hint of lemon made this divine. When it comes to Gramercy, this place never disappoints me with vegetables.Sea scallopsWe moved onto our second courses, one of them are the sea scallops with baby beets and bacon. The sea scallops were wonderfully crisp on the outside and medium-rare on the inside, as they should be. The quartered baby beets and its smooth, bright magenta purée added a subtle sweet-bitterness to the dish while the bacon added a slight salty, smoky bite.Stuffed meatballs and the oozy cheeseThe other dish that we had as our second course was the stuffed meatballs, which the waiter said it was one of the popular dishes there. Honestly, it disappointed me. To me, this was a ginormous meatball (the size of a baseball) that's been cooked whole, then halved and hollowed out in the center and stuffed it with a mild cheese with vegetables on the side. I liked the diced zucchini, tomatoes, and eggplant part but the meat killed my stomach since it's so dense. Giulia and I just split the half and we asked the waiter to wrap it up and give it to her younger brother, who isn't the adventurous type of eater.At this point of the meal, we're pretty stuffed but we must to move on to dessert!Milk Chocolate Bacon Tart & InnardsI wanted the milk chocolate bacon tart since reading it reminds me of the Mo Bacon Bar in a tart form. But besides the obvious, this is a bit more sophisticated. The crisp, buttery crust meets the creamy, ganache-like milk chocolate filling. The crème fraîche cuts the sweetness and added tangy tartness to the dessert, while the top were actually smoked sea salt flakes that gave my tastebuds a salty awakening. I didn't get the bacon but it was good.Peach Cobbler for TwoAnd as you can tell, there's more. This copper pan of the peach cobbler for two, topped with blackberry sorbet and ginger ice cream. This was what Giulia's been longing for and I can totally understand why. The peaches were so ripe, succulent and sweet baked with some sweet-tart blackberries. The topping is not the standard streusel; it's more like puff pastry. The ginger ice cream was velvety with an understated hit of ginger, while the blackberry sorbet was smooth and bursting with blackberry flavor. Despite of its delectable qualities (that we're getting a foodgasm), we were struggling to finish it and getting food coma. But thankfully to my expandable stomach and an applause to Giulia for actually eating more than she normally would, we finished it.We're DONE!After going through seven dishes, we felt like we're about to burst...or at least I was since I wore a fitted dress (not a smart move for anyone who's going to eat A LOT). We paid the check with our gift certificates given during Restaurant Week and the difference and waddled our way out.Address: Gramercy Tavern 42 East 20th Street (between Park Ave S & Broadway) New York, NY 10003 map

So funny.  I was here with my husband and a friend quite recently and ordered several of the same dishes.  It is nice to see them again.  =)  We had a great time.  I think my favorites were the duck terrine and then the mint chip in the ice cream trio...just amazing!

Throwing a Dessert Party for My Office

***CONTENT
Last Friday, my co-workers, scientists who are way more important than me, wanted to throw a dessert party. They bestowed upon me a mission to get sweets sometime before the summer ends. I've brainstormed a bit thinking what can appeal to most people and the most obvious one was cupcakes. What better place to get inexpensive (I'm on a certain budget), consistently good cupcakes than Sugar Sweet Sunshine.CUPCAKESArriving there before I have to get to work, I was prepared with a list of flavors that my co-workers wanted. They had everything BUT the coconut! I was mentally screaming, \"WHY?!\" I wanted that flavor too. Pooh. I ended up replacing the coconut with pistachio since it's still a nut but I know it isn't the same. Also, I gotten a small box of cupcakes for my supervisor since she loves cupcakes.Stacks of boxes and a Rainbow of CupcakesI've managed to haul three boxes of cupcakes and thankfully, without any major damage done to them going uptown during rush hour in the subway. If you ever been to the NYC subways during this time of the day, you know what I mean. Anyway, I've taken these photos (the latter actually) to tempt my co-workers via email when the time's nearing to the party. I know, I'm evil... As for what flavors I gotten for the lab, just click on the photo and it'll tell you. The most popular one was the sexy red velvet.Twist of soy milk ice creamLater on the afternoon during my lunch break, I went over to Kyotofu to pick up their mini miso choko cakes. Also, I have to try their soy milk soft-serve ice cream. The flavors of the week were white sesame and chocolate-black soybean. I wanted the twist of the two so I can taste both of them in one shot and topped it with mugi-choko (it's milk chocolate covered roasted barley). The ice cream was insanely good. I can't believe that it's just soy milk! It's so smooth and creamy and the flavors tasted like what it should be. Both flavors were nutty but the black soybean was chocolate-y too.The goods...Unexpectedly, the rain started to pour down when I left Kyotofu and left me running to the nearest subway, trying not to get the cakes wet. What surprised me was what Nicole, the co-owner of Kyotofu, generously threw in for me. Besides the mini chocolate souffle cupcakes, which I presumed were all that in the large pink box, there were mini green tea cupcakes underneath. I don't deserve this...Anyway, the hour arrived for the party and all went well. Thankfully, the lab members who wanted coconut cupcakes didn't have an issue with the pistachio cupcake substitute. We shared a portion of our cupcakes and traded with someone else to try something different. All of them were moist and delicious. The mini miso choko cakes delighted them. I thought most of them would think the miso's salty kick was weird with the chocolate-y, moist cake. As for the miniature cupcakes, they loved them too. At the end of this party, some of us (like me) had a stomach ache from ALL the sugar we ate but it's worth the pain.Addresses: Sugar Sweet Sunshine 126 Rivington Street New York, NY 10002 mapKyotofu 705 9th Avenue New York, NY 10019 map

Wrapping Up The Rest of Restaurant Week - Aquavit, Town, and Blue Water Grill

***CONTENT
The last two days of the official Restaurant Week, I've had lunch with my co-workers at Aquavit on Thursday and on Friday, I did a double-header of lunch (with Ariel at Town) and dinner (with Ariel and Helen). The first one is very familiar since I went there last year and the latter two were new places just to expand our horizons of what the city can offer.Aquavit Dining Room InteriorAt Aquavit, the menu was very similar to last year's except the fact that I'm eating in the Dining Room and the small tweaks in the menu. Instead of the avocado soup, they served the chilled corn soup for the appetizer; replacing the grilled salmon, they had the hot smoked salmon, and finally for dessert, they substituted the chocolate peanut butter cake with a chocolate custard cake. Since I remembered what the dishes tasted like from last year, I opted for the ones I haven't had, which is basically everything I've mentioned before.My foodThe chilled corn soup was sweet and refreshing. The pepper salad added a spicy kick while the scallop added another layer of sweetness to the soup. The hot smoked salmon was cooked well instead of my preferred medium-rare. In terms of taste, it was good and still relatively moist with the crisp skin. The vegetables harmonized with the fish and added crunchiness. As for the dessert of chocolate custard cake, it was a very intense chocolate cake. It's like eating a cross between fudge and a dense brownie but what appealed to me the most was the very refreshing, minty ice cream on top.Flavored AquavitsI almost forgot to mention that my supervisor actually bought three flavored aquavits for all of us to try - grapefruit, coriander and horseradish. If you haven't tried aquavit before, just think of it as Scandinavian vodka. The grapefruit was the sweetest of the three, with a hit of citrus. Coriander is quite pungent that I could smell it before tasting it. As for the horseradish (my supervisor's favorite), it's quite pungent as well but not as strong as the coriander. A new venture for me to try in terms of the liquor world but I would stick with cocktails since I can't really drink hard liquor shots before I would stumble and need the rest of the afternoon off.I work with themOverall, Aquavit's service and food was very good but I'm not as excited as I was last year since the food was familiar to me. Also, it was fun and interesting to have lunch with my relatively new co-workers. If you want to see the slideshow of the meal beyond what I've talked about, click here.Town's RW Menu & InteriorMoving onto Friday's lunch at Town, Ariel had arrived late since he's schlepping his butt from the Financial District to Midtown West. I chose this restaurant since it's relatively a last minute reservation that I could find since Del Posto's RW menu looked very unappealing to me. I don't really have high hopes for this place; I'm just curious if it's good at all.Almond GazpachoAriel and I had the almond gazpacho since that is more appealing than a salad. It's an interesting take but not exactly what I had in mind. The texture is really gritty from the almonds and it's relatively thick. The small fritter of a crabcake was a nice touch but it's not crisp.Steak FritesThe steak frites that Ariel wanted, was decent. The shortrib was cooked to a medium-rare but it's quite salty. The fries were crisp and salted but the herbs sprinkled on the fries didn't really add much flavor.Duck TortelliniMy duck torellini was quite al dente than what I would prefer in a tortellini. I think it's a bit thicker than what it should be. In terms of flavor, the duck was pretty much lackluster despite the meat being very tender.Mocha FondantMoving onto dessert, Ariel's mocha fondant was fine. The fondant was smooth and creamy with a hint of mocha flavor but it's not a thrilling dessert to eat.Strawberry Claufouti and InnardsAs for my strawberry claufouti, it's a tad better than the fondant. The claufouti was warm with a nice vibrant flavor of strawberries. The pistachio gelato on top doesn't have the wonderful buttery flavor that nuts has. Looks nice but it ain't that good.Birthday BeignetsSince I've told them that it's Ariel's birthday (it was on Friday), they served us a basket full of chocolate filled beignets. Honestly, these beignets were better than the desserts we had earlier. Fresh and warm. Oozing with chocolate when you bite off it's fried, sugar-coated exterior. This was really the highlight of the entire meal.Town is swanky but their food is really bland. Thankfully, I don't have to pay their regular priced food.Interior of Blue Water GrillFinally, dinner at Blue Water Grill. When I arrived to BWG a bit early and waiting for Ariel and Helen to arrive from work, this place was already packed with people. Even the walk-ins inquire for seating and they either have to eat outside in the humid heat or you have to wait until 9:45 for a table indoors. Thankfully, I made reservations.When they all finally showed up and got seated, we ordered in a simple fashion. Since there's three choices for each course, we all shared as a group, except for the first course which we had one gazpacho and two tartare tastings.Stone Fruit GazpachoAriel's stone fruit gazpacho was a better take on the gazpacho than what we had earlier the afternoon at Town. It's smoother, more refreshing and a bit more authentic.Tartare tasingHelen and I had the tartare tasting, which is pretty much a foodgasm for all of us (I shared with Ariel). It's sort of an upside down nigiri. The rice was pan-fried to have a caramelized, crisp crust topped with either tuna, salmon, or hamachi tartare with Satur Farms' micro herbs, drizzled with a nori vinaigrette. It blew our minds that all of us had our moment of silence and moaned how good it was. When we were slouching back in our chairs, our waiter came to our table and asked, \"How's everything?\" Ariel answered, \"Very good. Is it possible to have a lifetime supply of the tartare tastings?\"Lobster slidersHelen wanted to add lobster sliders to the meal. I expected to be an appetizer size but I was imagining a bit larger portion. Anyway, the chips were nothing special but the sliders were good. My tiff would be there's too much bread (it's a mini brioche bun) in comparison to the lobster meat filling.Our EntreesThe seafood-centric entrees panned out to be quite boring compared to the appetizers. The sesame crusted mahi-mahi was good in terms of textures but the flavors didn't astound me, except for the nuttiness of the toasted sesame. My prosciutto wrapped jumbo shrimp was pretty good. I don't really cared much about the chunks of green heirloom tomato they added. As for Helen's grilled Idaho rainbow trout, it's fine but the sauce tasted funny to me. Something about the flavor of olives and other flavors that made my palate thinking, \"What the heck am I tasting?\"Yep, I told themAs we moved on to dessert, I have told the host that it's Ariel's birthday so he gets another candle to blow out on his chocolate torte topped with black forest cherry ice cream. It's fine and it's a simple dessert.Strawberry Watermelon FizzHelen got the strawberry watermelon fizz that's made of strawberries, watermelon, and sparkling mint syrup. It's the best of the three desserts but I realized when I'm eating the individual elements of the dessert, the strawberry was pretty bland. The meringue was actually the best thing in that dessert even though I don't like meringues that much.Double Peach Pie and InnardsAs for my double peach pie this particular dessert really tanked. Too much crust. Very little peach filling. The entire thing tasted like the bourbon ice cream. Meh. I don't even the flavor of bourbon.Lesson here, go for the appetizers, skip pretty much everything else.Addresses: Aquavit 65 East 67th Street New York, NY 10022Town 15 West 56th Street New York, NY 10019Blue Water Grill 31 Union Sq W New York, NY 10003

Interior of Porchetta...sort ofProbably you've read enough food blog posts about Porchetta that your sick about reading it. Well, I'm one of those pesky bloggers who would jump ship to try something relatively new. I'm not saying I'm trying everything new for the sake of being \"hip\" but more of the idea of loving to get my hands on an awesome sandwich. What made me travel all the way down to East Village from the Upper East Side was for the love of pooorrk. Don't you know I love pork fat (or any animal fat)? Last week I've taken the downtown 6 train and waddled my way over toward First Avenue to Porchetta. Entering upon the minimalist interior of mostly white and blue-tiled walls with an intriguing version of the first aid choking victim poster, and blonde wood bar as counter seating with matching stools. But the centerpiece is when you glance at the glassed-stainless steel oven, encasing the large hunk of porchetta.Mmmm...I would eat the whole thingGlancing upon the short menu of a porchetta sandwich ($9), a porchetta platter ($12) with a side of beans and greens sans the roll, a few sides a la carte, and biscotti for dessert. I've asked for the crispy skin potatoes but they didn't have any available since they haven't gotten their shipment of potatoes. Pooh. So, I've just ordered their porchetta sandwich (like everyone else in the NYC food blogosphere is doing).Pork and cracklin'Coughing up $9.75 (including tax) for a sandwich like this, I had some expectations of greatness...and thinking of getting a slightly bigger portion. I do like the crunchy crust of the Sullivan St. ciabatta roll but it sort of taken over the pork's texture rather than balancing it. The pork itself was tender, moist with touches of crunchy cracklings but it's unevenly flavored - some parts were nicely seasoned and a punch of garlic while other parts of the sandwich needed some salt. I can't judge a lot from a place that opened a few days but at least I could say \"I tried it.\"But when you do have the urge to have dessert and coffee to cap off your meal, you can head over to Abraço and get their addictive cured black olive cookie and robust iced coffee.Iced Coffee and Cured Olive CookiePorchetta 110 East 7th Street New York, NY 10009 mapAbraço 86 East 7th Street New York, NY 10003 map

As promised from the previous post, here's the recipe for my mom's chocolate cake. It's decadent, chocolate-y and nutty from the use of almond flour. Again, I had to make my own almond flour since the grocery stores I shop in don't carry it. The other changes I've done was to add on the chocolate glaze that was left over from my brother's cake and used Lindt's Excellence 85% Cocoa Bar for the chocolate solids. What surprised me was the fact that it was easy to make.Recipe and a lot of dumpingFrom La Maison du Chocolat: Transcendent Desserts by the Legendary ChocolatierServes 4-6 Preparation: 25 minutes Cooking time: 25 minutes2 1/2 ounces bittersweet chocolate 5 tablespoons unsalted butter 3/4 cup ground almonds 2 whole eggs plus 6 yolks 3/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon granulated sugar 1/3 cup cocoa powder 4 egg whites Pinch of salt 1 teaspoon vanilla extractTip: Dust the top of the cooled cake with unsweetened cocoa powder for a more sophisticated finish. (I drizzled on chocolate glaze, dust it with cocoa powder, then add some white chocolate shavings to amp up the chocolate factor.)All pretty and await to be consumed...Cross section of my slice

hi,
i want to try this cake for my SO's birthday but have a few questions:
1. you mentioned you needed to make your own almond flour but the recipe doesnt call for almond flour?
2. for 3/4 cup ground almonds...is this just finely chopped? (cuz i see small chunks in your pics)...when i see \"ground\" almonds...i'm thinking almost to the consistency of powder.  can you clarify?  is ground almonds something i can buy or do i have to buy almonds and ground it myself?
3. for step 1 of the recipe, you're suppose to pour the ground almonds into the chocolate mixture in a thin stream...how does one actually do that?
4. can you explain the need for unmolding onto the dish towel?  do you think i can bake it in a spring-form pan instead and not cool it in a dishtowel?i'm obviously an amateur baker but these are pricey ingredients so i want to get it right!  thanks for taking the time to answer my questions.
thewanderingeater
2008-10-02 10:29:00
Danny: Thanks!hnahk: You should try! It's really easy.Here's the answers to your questions:
1. Almond flour is pretty much the same to me for ground almonds. Technically, yes, the flour is finer than the grounded stuff but since I made this myself with a blender (you may use a food processor) and a not-so-humid evening with a lot of patience not to make this into almond butter, it'll be slightly chunky.2. Please refer to #1 and it's after the grind...3. Take a measuring cup full of ground almonds (in the correct amount, of course) and lightly shake the contents out that it should be like a stream. It's not difficult.4. You don't have to do the dish towel. I used a cooling rack. In other words, I took the relatively hot cake (with pot holders on each side) with a cooling rack on top then invert it so the parchment-covered bottom is facing up. You could bake it in a springform pan but the time will vary but it's best to take off that bottom so it won't be soggy in that area.

She blew out the candle!Today's technically my mom's birthday. (I'm not going to divulge her age.) We celebrated a bit more than week earlier. \"Why?\" you ask. Well, her excuse was the fact that last weekend was the Mid-Autumn Festival and we can nosh on moon cakes (I love the lotus seed filled ones with no yolks. I how know you traditionalists feel but I like it that way.) and chocolate caaake. Not any cake, it has to come out from the La Maison du Chocolat cookbook.InnardsThe cake turned out very good, as you can see. I'll post up the recipe tomorrow. I need sleep with the unfortunate drama with my mom's health (so many tests involved with her and going back and forth, talking to various doctors) and work.

Quite a crowdLate yesterday afternoon, I went over to Il Buco's \"Sagra del Maiale\" in hopes to get my hands on a piece of the 200 lb Ossabaw pig that's slowly roasted between two large iron griddles with wood fire above and below. Alas, I came in late at 5 PM that all that remains is its head and hooves. Damn. Fortunately, they did have some whole suckling pig to keep this outdoor party going for the next hour and the other stuff is still coming out of their kitchen.The food spreadA plate of full food costs $20 (including a lemonade or iced tea) which isn't bad when you look at it.My plated assortment of foodThe good thing was there's some greens and vegetables (Farmer's Market panzanella and arugula salad with red onion, lemon, and pecorino) to balance out the pork-centric plate. Between the two meat dishes - the roasted suckling pig and crackling and the Flying Pigs Farm Porchetta Panini on Ciabatta with Blueberry Balsamic Mostarda, the sandwich would be my favorite - by a slight margin. The blueberry baslsamic mostarda (think blueberries blended with mustard) played along with the pork's natural sweetness. I just wish the sandwich was warmed.Suckling pig and craklingThe suckling pig was delicious, juicy and fatty (also it helps getting a large side of crackling) but the plastic cutlery didn't do much to get a small bite of crispy skin so I had to go primitive and eat it with my hands. I just felt bad for the older women on my table to watch me eat with my fingers.Il Buco 47 Bond Street New York, NY 10012

Awww...  You should have scored the head.  The cheeks are one of the best parts.  Not that there's really a bad part on the pig.

Awesome Haute Greek at Kefi

I remember reading from NY Magazine's review about Kefi and put their name on my lengthy \"Must Try\" restaurants list. Somehow, that list was forgotten and banished to the dark, hidden corners of my mind. Even hanging out with a friend of mine over the course of the year who has mentioned Kefi nearly ten times, telling me how great this place is. I still haven't went there. Until several Fridays ago.PEOPLE...Namely, my friendsI invited eight friends (of the group, Jess and Robyn were the only ones with blog/sites). Since it was during the prime dinner hour (we arrived at 7:30) and they don't take reservations, we had to sit and wait at the front bar area for fifteen to twenty minutes. At least we had time to chat and get to know each other since to some haven't met each other before.Dining Room Interior (partial view)By the time that party before us finally paid the check and left the restaurant, the largest table they had was finally available! Weee...BreadMost of us helped ourselves to a slice of bread since we're pretty much at the point of starvation. Nothing extraordinary about this baked carb but it helped sustain us for the moment before we actually get the food.Crispy SweetbreadsWe've ordered two plates of crispy sweetbreads. I think by now, you know I love sweetbreads (or any offals). What makes this different from other restaurants is that they deep fried it - which makes it more awesome. They mixed it with some spinach, overgrown capers that were the size of olives, cannellini beans, and another fried substance that I can't figure out. The drawback was the sweetbreads were getting soggy from sitting in its sauce. It's still tasty but I like my fried stuff crispy.Spreads with pita breadThe selection of spreads, which is an assortment of four dips that's served with warmed pita bread. (You may click on the spread photo that's above on the right to know which is which.) My favorite of the bunch is the \"caviar\" or in Greek, taramosalata. I never knew salted fish roe would taste so creamy.Grilled OctopusMoving onto the grilled octopus, this was pretty damn tender - comparable to what I ate at Babbo. The non-rubbery octopus with the crunchy chickpeas and sweet-tart sun dried tomatoes tasted like a wonderful symphony. I just wish I had more despite the fact we're sharing one plate of this amongst all of us.Crispy CodThe crispy cod made me think \"Mmmm...garlic-y potatoes.\" Don't get me wrong, the cod was good and crispy but the potatoes smothered with garlic tomato love was more appealing to my taste buds. For the moment, I'm thinking if they created a sandwich out of this dish, I would be happy eating it. I just need to figure out how not to get the potato and tomato part not squish out when I bite into that sandwich. Hmmm...Flat pasta with braised bunnyI really liked the flat pasta dish. The egg-y pasta, fork-tender rabbit, tangy graviera cheese, and sweet hints from the pearl onions. It's a bit hearty for a late summer dish but I don't mind warming up to it during the colder months of winter.Braised Lamb shankThe braised lamb shank with orzo was enormous in terms of size. Thankfully, I had many stomachs people to eat with me. The moist, succulent lamb worked very well with the delicate orzo. But at this point, my stomach wants me to stop eating.Pork souvlakiBut I can't stop. The pork souvlaki is calling my name - a huge warm, grilled pita wrapped with juicy shredded pork, tzatziki, and a medley of onions, bell peppers, and herbs. The problem was figuring out how to tackle this beast to get a share and not make a mess of it. The sides that's served along with the souvlaki are a creamy rice dish mixed with spinach and dill and a cherry tomato and feta salad.After eating this haute Greek feast, we asked for the check since we're pretty much at the point of feeling satiated. For what we ate, this was an inexpensive dinner - each of us paid about $17. Besides the price of what we spent for this meal, I would come back after they move to their new space several blocks uptown. The food's excellent, prices are gentle and I miss seeing my friends (especially the ones I haven't seen in recent months).Kefi 222 W 79th Street New York, NY (map)Will be moving to 505 Columbus Avenue (map) around late September

That looks like a fantastic feast!I bet Wylie at wd~50 could turn a cod and mashed potato dish into a sandwich. They could probably find a way to deep fry the mashed potato so it has a hard outter shell that would make it stand up to squishing.

I want to try sweetbreads!  I haven't been around but I wanted to say that my thoughts and well wishes are with your mother.  Best of luck with that.  <3Back to a lighter note, this sounds absolutely delicious, I love Greek food.  Taramasalata actually isn't the same as tarama though it's made with tarama, obvs.  Taramasalata has bread or potatoes in it (f'reals; when I was in Greece and the owner came over to tell us this, we were boggled) and yogurt as well I believe.  So delicious *cries* I've been looking for a really good, accessible version.  The jarred kind is kind of crap and Turkish Kitchen isn't like, right on my way home or anything.  Ah well.

Hi Everyone,I would like to thank all of you who've wished my mom and family well. It's greatly appreciated and my mom's ok for now but still a little shaky with uncertainty of what's going to happen. We're waiting on the testing results and what they doctors suggest as we go along. If you're wondering what's wrong with her, they've found a small tumor in her colon. In other words, colon cancer.I hope I didn't lose any of you because I'm not writing as often as I would like with the aforementioned and because of the plethora of photos I have to edit by today for a job. I never thought a hobby like would feel like a job until this week. Anyway, I'm working on the extremely belated Kefi post and hopefully it's up by this weekend.The little request I would like to ask from you, besides being patient with me is, if you do have Facebook please join my blog network. Honestly, I haven't started it myself but my faithful reader and avid Facebook user, Tiffany started it. Just to keep that particular page/network alive, you have to join it or I'll just close that page by the end of next week if there isn't a significant amount of people joining.That's pretty much it for now. Have a good weekend!

I would hug your mom for being a strong fighter.You shouldn't deny that your mother's diagnosed with lung cancer. I know it's hard to embrace and live with it but it's something we have to cope and try to make the best out of the (one of the many) worst possible situation. When the cancer does go into complete remission, we can all breathe a little easier and stop taking life for granted.

Hi Everyone!I know I owe you guys a post of some sort to show that you I'm still alive, breathing and eating.I went to Kefi two Fridays ago (or was it three?) and baked a few things for my mom last weekend. (If you've seen the photos on my Flickr photostream, you know.) Also the past Monday, I went out and go for photo shoots (in the name of food) and get paid for it. Woot. I just need to edit a TON of photos before the week's over.I would tell you all of this but I have a family crisis to deal with - my mother's ill again and no offense to all of you, blogging is the last thing on my mind. So, I'll get back to all of you wonderful readers once the drama's over on the family side (temporarily) and get my photo shoot job finished up.

Tapas at Casa Mono

***CONTENT
I finally ate hereFor several years, I've been dying to go to Casa Mono just because I read about their tasty tapas in a publication (I think it was The New York Times?) that extolled the food. Also hearing it from several foodies helps build my excitement to eat there as well. But I haven't gone there since I didn't know anyone who would eat there with me. That's until I met up with my Aussie reader, Suzen and her friend Sarah who was interested in trying out the food. Woot.Open KitchenSince we didn't make any reservations for the time we've met up, the only option was to sit at the bar. Not a problem really, since I like to watch chefs cook in front of me and my dining companions didn't mind.We've discussed about what to order since Suszen and Sarah aren't exactly adventurous eaters like I am but they've agreed to try and expand their food horizons. Half of what I planned to order were offals and thankfully, they trust my tastebuds. While waiting for our food, we noshed on the bread and olives. I liked the green olives a lot - the salty, acidic, brininess appeals to me. The bread tasted like the superb filone from Sullivan Street Bakery.Sweetbreads!The first two dishes that arrived were the sweetbreads with fennel al Mono and foie gras with cinco cebollas. The sweetbreads came in three fairly large chunks - breaded and fried. The most tastiest way to cook almost any food, no? The sweetbreads were moist and creamy with a hint of fennel flavor and a salty bite. Not much of a crunch factor but I like the flavors a lot.Foie Gras with Cinco CebollasThe other dish, foie gras gras with cinco cebollas was quite interesting. For those who don't know Spanish, cinco cebollas means five onions. The onions were actually the petals of this flower-like presentation. It's cute and pretty. If you look at the photo, the foie gras is on top, right below it is a thick slice of toasted baguette that has the same sauce as the foie. What I love about this dish (it's my favorite of all the plates we ate) were the crunchy texture of the bread, meets the silky smooth foie, and the combination of sweet, acidic and salty flavors in every bite. The red onion was a nice addition to cut through the complex flavors and makes a gentle, sweet statement of its own.Duck Egg with Mojama...with oozy egg yolkThe famous duck egg with mojama didn't disappoint. The pan fried duck egg was barely cooked that its yolk wiggled as I tried moving the plate around. I let Suszen do the honors of forking the egg yolk, letting it cascade the cholesterol and protein-laden goodness down the tower of patatas bravas and mojama (cured tuna). The second thing that struck my senses were the heady scent of TRUFFLES from the vinaigrette and a hefty load of black truffle chopped within this dish. I guess this sort of justify the price tag of $16.Cock's CombThe most daring offal I've ever tried in my life (sweetbreads, feet, tripe, and a few other things are normal in my life) was this dish of cock's combs with cepes. Yes, we're talking about me (and arguably my poor companions, Suszen and Sarah) ingesting the crest of a rooster. How does it taste like? I thought it tasted like mushrooms just because the cepes' (also known as porcini) flavors melded the cock's combs. Texturally, it's quite gelatinous, which was a huge turn-off for Sarah. Suszen tolerated it. I liked it but it's not something I would pick by default if I saw it on a menu (that's reserved for pig's feet, tripe, sweetbreads, and/or foie gras).Sugar Snap PeasAs we're nearing our lunch, we gotten our side dish of sugar snap peas with Marconas. We needed some fiber into our offal/meat-filled meal. The snap peas were sautéed to a nice crisp texture and slightly slick with olive oil. The Marconas are presumably the orange-red bits that's sprinkled on top. Personally, I didn't think it added much but the peas were good - just not extraordinary as to what I ate at Gramercy Tavern.Fideos with Clams & ChorizoFinally we have our fideos with clams and chorizo. We've actually spotted the chef cooking this dish while we're about to consume our duck egg with mojama. This is basically the most safest dish we ate. Very thin spaghetti-like strands of pasta sautéed with small clams and spicy chorizo.Address: Casa Mono 52 Irving Place New York, NY 10003 (map)

Funny, Casa Mono has always been on my short list of places to dine when I'm in New York and lately I'm obsessed with sweetbreads so this makes me want to go even more.  The addition of fennel seems very natural, I think I've seen that on a couple menus now but I haven't had the chance to try it for real.

Hey Tina!  So great to meet you last night as well!  This blog is great and, as Mona said, I'll be a regular reader as well.Casa Mono is serious fancy tapas.  But it looks inspired and very creative which I love.  Your description of the cocks comb was perfect - I could almost feel it in my mouth.  Americans really do have a major problem with all things warm and gelatinous. I would def. give this a try as we love, love, love offal.Your pics are beautiful! We make fidueos often at home, but I gotta say, as gorgeous as that dish looks at CM, it looks super annoying to eat. We'll have to put up our fidueos recipe up soon!Anyways, I'll be back and I'll be living vicariously through this blog (we can't really afford to eat out like this often).Amy @ we are never full :)

Is the sheet of gelatin just a prepared box of knox unflavored, straight out of the fridge?

VeggieGirl: They are. You should try and bake 'em!HiDude: Nope. Gelatin is sold in two forms, powdered (the one that we all know is the Knox brand) or in a pack of sheets. Just read this portion of Serious Eats' post, this should help you out.

[Note: I'm splitting one night of fooding into two parts. You'll find out where it is on the next post or if you've already checked out my Flickr photostream a while ago, you know it regardless.]Last Monday I've planned to celebrate Helen's birthday early. It's warm enough and hell, it's been a while since I've seen anyone besides my co-workers and family. I don't have issues with either parties but it's nice to see friends whom you love, no? Also the fact that I've planned to have brunch with Robyn the weekend of Helen's actual birthday, so I'd rather commemorate her 24 years of existence on this planet early, rather than late, with the things she loves: desserts, ramen, and booze.Dessert Club Chikalicious & Its Baked GoodsWe kicked off our fooding with Dessert Club Chikalicious after being inspired and longing to try their desserts when I've read Ed Levine's post. We thought that it's too early to have dinner and it's the closest to the subway stop, we went there first.Triple Chocolate Cupcake & InnardsWhat I love about this cupcake was the fact it wasn't the size of a baby's head, intensely chocolate-y without being outrageously sweet, and the delicate, moist crumb. This is probably one of my favorite cupcakes. Helen was savoring every morsel as she just ate her half with bird-sized nibbles.Adult Chocolate PuddingWe then moved on to the adult chocolate pudding. Man, I wish I could make chocolate pudding this luscious and silky. It's like eating a creamy, not-so-sweet chocolate cloud. The chocolate streusel crumbs added a nice crunchy texture. I would eat a gallon of this.Strawberry cheesecakeWhen we finally start noshing on the strawberry cheesecake, I was amazed how light it is. The crumbled graham cracker crust on top with the sweet strawberries, lightly sweetened, whipped cream (that's the small, white oval next to the berries) and the creamy yet light cheesecake made it quite divine.Minca's menuAfter finishing our desserts, we waddled our semi-stuffed selves over to Minca for the sake of Helen's love of ramen.Minca RamenHelen's plan was to get their namesake bowl, the Minca ramen. The large bowl (probably has the size of a baby watermelon) filled with slurp-able ramen, salty, silky, collagen-rich pork broth, shredded black mushrooms, half a sheet of dried seaweed, half of a hard boiled egg and two moderately sized chunks of lipid rich pork (say 1/4 of the chunk is fat, while the rest is soft, succulent meat).Toroniku RamenI ordered the toroniku ramen since it sounded decadently porky when I read it on the menu. And it was quite over the top when my bowl arrived. What made it more extravagant, if you will, were the facts that the broth is much more richer and not as salty as the Minca, there were a few more chunks of pork that's more fattier (approximately 50:50 fat to melt in your mouth, sweet meat), and topped with chopped leaves of raw cabbage to balance out all of the delicious fattiness one is about to ingest from this bowl.Gelatinous pork chunksWe've struggled to finish our bowls of ramen, sort of regretting the desserts we ate earlier. Feeling a bit disgusting and our bellies full of food, Helen and I decided to walk all the way from the East Village down to Chinatown to burn a few calories and unintentionally to our final destination of the evening to...[that's part 2]Addresses: Dessert Club Chikalicious 204 E 10th Street New York, NY 10003 (map)Minca 536 E 5th Street New York, NY 10009 (map)

I know I'm supposed to post food-related reviews and a recipe but the past week sucked for me. I got sick a little over a week ago. Methinks I got the flu or a really bad case of the cold that I can't breathe through my nose and I'm coughing like a smoker (I don't smoke, btw.) and have a sore throat. So, depending on my life on over the counter pharmaceuticals make me sleepy or make me feel like my mind's tripping. Uuuggh... Not fun.Also my mom went to surgery mid-week to get a port implanted in her shoulder. She's doing well now. Honestly, I think she's in a better condition than me health-wise!So, here's a few pics as a preview to the upcoming a super belated post about celebrating Helen's birthday early...two weeks ago. Damn, I really have to catch up.Desserts!Ramen!

Brunch at Shopsin's

Jeebus, the LINE!On weekends when I don't have to necessarily rush to go anywhere, I like to take my sweet ol' time going to brunch with a friend or a few (if it's possible) but I managed to have Helen fairly last minute. I know I'm admitting something relatively shocking but I have never been to Shopsin's before my visit two Saturdays ago. Yes! Mock me, why don't you?! As a native New Yorker who's never eaten here, I know it's a relative shame despite reading about Shopsin for years. Back to the story... I arrived to Shopsin's around 12 PM with a shorter line than what you see above. (I took this toward the end of my meal around 1.) It's just two parties ahead of me.What to choose?!Once we got seated after waiting about 15 minutes or so, we've been staring at the legal-sized, double-sided menu that's squished with what seems like a hundred or so choices. Eventually, we made up our minds and ordered. However, we had to wait for our food for 20 minutes or so because of a mishap that I will explain later.State Fair PlateHelen gotten herself the State Fair plate. What enticed her was the fact that everything is fried. A large chunk of deep-fried breaded sausage (which is the corndog), a large flat golden brown foodstuff that's actually fried egg, and s'more cakes. Just to make this plate a bit healthier, they threw in a few slices of fresh watermelon.Helen's favorite part of the dish was the s'more cakes since it's very sweet. When I tried a wedge, I felt like I'm eating little pancakes that's made with a pound of sugar. It ain't bad but these were meant to be for Helen. (In case you didn't know, she loves sugar. And I mean LOTS of it.)That's a huge biteWhat you see above is Helen's weird way she eats her food. If you do hang out with her long enough, you're accustomed to witness this. What she did was take small chunks of each food item on her plate and stab it on her fork then topped it with strawberry jelly, or whatever fruit jelly's available (that's what you see on top of the sausage). Did this somewhat crazy concoction work? Admittedly, yes - the salty bite of the sausage, the sweet of the s'more cake, and the fruit jelly adds a fruity twist; except the egg doesn't add anything except for a greasy taste.Bacon & Eggs PancakesAs for me, I gotten myself bacon & eggs pancakes for the sake of sounding like breakfast, which I didn't really have that morning. Unless you consider a cup of coffee and a piece of fruit breakfast. What I didn't expect was to have small pancakes that's made with cooked scrambled eggs and bacon. So, it's literally a cross of savory (eggs and bacon) and sweet (pancakes).Ketchup & Maple syruped pancakesHow I ate them was to drizzle maple syrup all over my food and squirted ketchup. I just wish I've asked for some Tabasco sauce; it needed a peppery kick.Sliders!Also we shared an order of sliders. These babies were the main reason why we've been waiting for so long. What our waitress told me, the kitchen had \"an accident\" with our sliders so they've delayed delivering our food until it's all set. We're happy to see the food and all's forgiven. We're starving by then.Oh yeah...Once Helen started to get her hands onto one of the sliders, a whole mess of caramelized onions started to dangle out of the bun. Looks tempting, no? I usually prefer my burgers medium-rare (the rarer, the better) but they cooked it well, except I like them a lot. The meat's flavorful and the sweet onions and melted American cheese added flavor, sweetness, and gooey texture. The buns were the standard soft bun but in the slider size, which I don't have any issue with. I haven't eaten a burger or in this case, slider this tasty in a while.Finished!By the time we finished everything, we're stuffed. When our plates were about to be cleared, one of the guys (whom I would presume is Kenny Shopsin's son) done the classic Shopsin language - using the f-word but in a non-insulting way. It almost felt wrong if I didn't hear it once after reading so much about it. We asked for the check and waddled around the Lower East Side to burn a few calories that we just ingested.Shopsin In the Essex Market 120 Essex Street, Stall #16 New York, NY 10002 (map)

I love that after your first course, you were still starving when the sliders arrived. I totally respect a good appetite!
And thanks for sharing your Shopsins experience. After reading about it in last Sunday's NYT Magazine, and living...sigh...on the west coast, I knew it would be a long time before I had the chance to check out those f-bomb loving restaurant owners. Thanks for sharing....I almost feel like I was there. Without the stuffed bell, sadly!

[I'm supposed to write about my brunch with Helen at Shopsin's that took place two Saturdays ago but I don't feel like it. I'll post it once it's ready to go...]Last Thursday when I gotten my free sandwich from AQ Kafe, I walked over two blocks to the Time Warner Building to visit Bouchon Bakery for something sweet to cap off my lunch. When I peered in their refrigerated pastry case, I saw something I haven't eaten since I was a wee lass, Ho-Hos.That's one fancy Ho-ho...Knowing that Chef Thomas Keller likes to play with desserts and nostalgia (for example, their TKO is an upscale version of the Oreo cookie and the Nutter Butter) with pretty good results, I thought I might as well give it a try. Just looking at it before starting to ingest this baby, it's quite large and promising.InnardsWhen I took a bite, I was relatively disappointed. Bouchon's Ho-Ho is definitely elegant but the ratio of vanilla-specked whipped cream to cake is practically 3:1. Don't get me wrong, I love whipped cream but it was overkill for my preference. The cake was moist and chocolate-y as the crisp, chocolate coating (due to tempering) was good. I think what threw me off was the fact that I'm expecting the original Ho-Ho, which obviously doesn't work out.After my work day was done I headed over to Shake Shack since I had time on my hands until I have to head over to the Serious Eats office to pick up macarons from Mitzy. (I'll talk about that later.)Pumpkin Pie-Oh-My! ConcreteDespite the fact that's it's almost 5 PM, the A-line (the line for burgers and everything else) was quite long. I would estimate a 30-minute wait by the time I would be ordering, if I felt hungry enough to eat a burger. But it wasn't my craving. I wanted (or desire?) their Pumpkin Pie-Oh-My! concrete. Even though I had to linger for 15 minutes or so, it was worth the wait.The dense, creamy vanilla custard blended with chunks of nicely spiced pumpkin pie. Not too sweet, not too heavily spiced that I was in custard heaven. Also the amount of whipped cream wasn't off the wazoo compared to what I ate earlier at Bouchon.There's a tree house?But while I was taking my time eating my concrete and people watching around the park, I realized that there's a tree house. That struck me as...odd. Since when was this up?As I've mentioned earlier, I've been graced by Mitzy's macarons. She came in from New Jersey to drop them off at Serious Eats' office. Here's a photo splodge of the macarons she gave me to sample:MACARONS!In case you haven't her post about her class with the legendary pastry chef Pierre Herme, I suggest you to read it. She has learned a lot from this man (or should I say, pastry god?). She's inspired to start a macaron business hence the reason why she (along with Robyn and a few other lucky people) trying out her delightful experiments. I'm seriously grateful to be her guinea pig.I have no doubt that she would crush pretty much all of the competition in NYC. Each time I've eaten her macarons, they keep getting better and better. The crust is perfectly thin and crisp. The crumb is fluffy, not too moist and flavorful of whatever flavor it supposed to be (like pistachio actually taste like a pistachio, not some alcoholic almond flavor). The fillings are spot on in terms of sweetness. I cannot find a flaw in these macarons except wanting more of them. Now I feel like I'm going through macaron withdrawal since I'm hankering for one now...Bouchon Bakery 10 Columbus Circle, 3rd Floor New York, NY (map)Shake Shack Southeast corner of Madison Ave & 23rd Street New York, NY (map)

I have to say I am a lurker but after years of living in Paris and now NYC(and just a few blocks away from both La Duree and Pierre Herme's boutiques while in Paris with at least once weekly visits...) I had to hop out and say I am absolutely jealous about the macaron tasting.if there is one french thing I would love to know how to make those would be it (second would be Kayser Canneles!) but at least this can give me hope that I will find something that really resembles (Bouchon is NOTHING near) a real macaron :)

So much tastiness, all in one day! It is too bad that the Bouchon Hoho was such a disappointment. It shows you looks aren't everything, no? I have to say I agree, there looks to be far too much cream in there.The custard makes me wish (again) that we had Shake Shacks  in Canada.I cannot get over the gorgeous hues of the macarons! Just so vibrant. Thanks for sharing all of this.

stinkerbell: Nice to hear from you! I envy the fact that you lived in Paris (my dream to visit someday) and you LIVE near Laudree AND PH?! Waah...Anyway, I do agree with you that Bouchon's macarons are NOT real French macarons. Textures are off (they tend to be very chewy and almondy) and they're humongous (the American portion size; bigger doesn't always mean better).VeggieGirl: Definitely!M+Y: I have to backtrack on what you're referring. But yeah, the Bouchon Ho-Ho looks very enticing but it's a FAIL. :(Kathy: I wish she opened her bakery/business by now! I'd totally be her usual customer. I'm officially addicted. Hahaha...Tara: Yeah, looks aren't everything but it does count a bit.The concrete (or custard) is very good. This is the only place in NYC that we could get this stuff.You're welcome and thanks for reading! :)

That Ho-Ho looks sooooo gourmet! But then, it is from Bouchon Bakery. I know what ya mean, though, it DOES look like an awful lot of cream. I, too, love cream. But do you want a giant mouthful of cream and nothing else? I think not....

Tina, thank you so much for mentioning my macarons on your blog, I'm very flattered :-)About the pumpkin pie concrete that you got, does Shake Shack have that flavor everyday?  I didn't see it on the custard calendar and I'm on a \"mission\" to try good pumpkin desserts :-)

I picked up some macaroons at bouchon this week, along with a TKO and the tuna sandwich... the macaroons and sandwich were yummy, and the tko... i couldn't even finish it after 2 bites... i think i went into it with the same thought you did with the ho-ho's... i was expecting something even yummier and delicious then an oreo, and that just cannot be...

If you're an avid reader of the food blog Midtown Lunch, you would've known that AQ Kafe has given out sandwiches for free today. I wouldn't mind schlepping crosstown for a free lunch.It's not a secret...Arriving there around 11:25, there was a line out the door but it moves quite briskly (about seven minutes from standing on line 'til receiving my sandwich.) There's a sign at the registers listing the free sandwiches: Black Forest Ham, Roast Beef, Vine-ripened tomato, and Wild Tuna Salad.Black Forest Ham SandwichI opted for the ham just because it's supposedly filled with red cabbage, apple, sauerkraut, herb mustard, and it's encased with onion rye bread. When I actually bite into it, it's missing apples and it's on the smallish side. But I'm not complaining for something that tastes good and it's free. Normally, this baby would cost me $8.95 (about $9.70, including tax), which I wouldn't pay for unless I know it's earth shatteringly awesome. At least I know... Probably I'll drop in another day for their pastries and cakes, which did look enticing.AQ Kafe 1800 Broadway (between W 59th & 59th Streets) New York, NY 10019 (map)

[Here's my long overdue post on my birthday dinner at Kuma Inn that's taken place on November 7th.]Kuma Inn's Entrance and InteriorAfter having [cref my-birthday-celebration-part-1-cakes-drinks-and-fried-hot-dogs a cocktail at PDT], we (as in Helen, Giulia, Seungmi, and I) all walked down south to the Lower East Side for Asian tapas at Kuma Inn. Since it's a relatively small group than what I've originally planned on, I didn't bother with reservations even though it's a Friday night. We're lucky that a party of four canceled last minute so we've scored a table. We just have to wait five minutes or so for them to set up the table. Once seated, we started to figure out what we want to eat. Problem is, our stomachs were kind of full because of the fried hot dogs we ate at PDT but we pressed on and ordered a bunch of plates.Seaweed saladWe started with a light starter, mixed seaweed chuka salad with sesame and chili. It reminds me of the cold noodle and seaweed dish we had in [cref dinner-not-drinking-for-me-at-least-at-kasadela Kasadela]. The difference between these two was that Kasadela's was a bit more refreshing. Kuma's version tasted a bit more earthier, if that made any sense.Grilled salmonThen we move on to the Grilled salmon, shitake mushrooms and baby bok choy. It's cooked to a well done but still moist, topped with salty salmon roe, and sitting on a bed of stir-fried bok choy and other vegetation mixed with a sweet-hot sauce. It's a favorite for the majority (Helen and Giulia loves salmon). I prefer the salmon to be a bit more rarer but it does taste very good.Spicy tofu and mushroomsFollowing up with sautéed tofu, thai basil and wood ears in spicy soy mirin, this is arguably the least liked. I do like the fact that it came out of the kitchen piping hot but it's really spicy which Helen doesn't like. Giulia doesn't like wood ears mushrooms and Seungmi doesn't want to eat it because her stomach isn't feeling so great that particular week. I ended up eating most of that dish and my throat was in relative pain from the heat. It's not a bad dish but most of us can't handle the heat.The night's special: PORK BUNS!But thankfully, we have that evening's special to save us, the steamed pork buns. Perhaps a nod to Momofuku's but it's not close to it. They used the actual Chinese mantou and stuff it with lean, pulled pork meat and top it with pickled daikon and sliced scallions. There's too much bread to meat ratio and without any sauce (except for that salty/sweet dippping sauce on the side) and the pickled veggies, it's on the bland side. I prefer the pork belly fattiness of Momofuku's buns.ScallopsThe pan roasted ocean scallops with bacon, kalamansi and sake was arguably the smallest portion size for what we paid for. The scallops were small (about the diameter of a quarter) and it lacked bacon flavor unless you eat the greens that's sitting on the side.Chinese sausageThen we move on to the highly touted dish (at least on Chowhound), Sautéed Chinese sausage with Thai chili-lime sauce. I think the ones used from Kuma Inn are the mediocre stuff from that's bought from Chinatown. I mean, probably for the ones who haven't traveled to China or Hong Kong and eaten the \"real\" thing (or have a really awesome aunt from HK to ship a few pounds to you and eat them), I guess it's passable. I'm just not thrilled with it because I've eaten superlative Chinese sausages at home.Deep-fried pork belly!Finally we've reached the final dish of the evening, deep–fried pork belly lechon kawali with atchara. I loved the crispiness of the pig skin melding with the large, moist chunks of pork meat. If there was an after shot of that dish, there's nothing much left remained except a few strands of shredded pickled vegetables and a small pool of dipping sauce.We all felt stuffed and bloaty, regretting that we ordered that many dishes but we enjoyed our meal. We paid the check and waddled our way around the semi-crowded streets of Lower East Side, filled with the Europeans and nightlife-loving people, to go home.Address: Kuma Inn 113 Ludlow Street, 2nd Floor New York, NY 10002 (map)

[I'm holding back on writing about Kuma Inn after this post...]The past Saturday, November 15th, I met up with Helen and Dannie to try out as many things as our stomach can handle at Momofuku Milk Bar & Bakery after reading Ed's preview and seeing a few friends' photos (they went in early for the Friends & Family preview), I'm salivating at the thought of eating there. So, I proposed to meet up at 11 AM for the sake of avoiding the crowds.MenuDespite the fact that it was rainy and early (in terms of the sleepyheads for a Saturday morning), this place was buzzing with activity. There's a short line of people ordering their food whilst everyone else was spread all over the bakery's tables that are on the tall side for my short stature. (Hey, I'm 5′3″ what do you expect?) I've joined the line (first round was a ten minute wait, sans Dannie) and saw a whole bunch of these lovelies:Come to mama...Since my lack of breakfast and the temptation that's right in front of my face, I've told Helen we'll split an egg and pork bun and a slice of chocolate chip cake.The pork bun of awesomenessI wholeheartedly love Momofuku's pork buns which consists of two slices of pork belly, wafer thin cucumber slices, hoisin sauce and scallions. But they gilded the lily by adding a deep fried soft poached egg. This is seriously awesome but soo bad for my arteries.Helen's not happyWhen it comes to our slice of chocolate chip cake, it came in a box (we wanted to stay in) and it was smushed. She would prefer to have her cake photogenic. Awww... [pat pat] But all is not lost since Dannie arrived and we ordered a whole bunch of stuff. An extra stomach who is eager to ingest a ton of sweets is always welcome in my book. (The second round of waiting was about 25 minutes, btw. The line snaked back toward the entrance.)Salted Pistachio Caramel Sundae (my way)What we started with was the salted pistachio caramel soft serve with peanut butter halvah and hot fudge sauce. All I could say was \"Mmmmm...\" The salty kick from the caramel with the hint of pistachio flavor and the dense, silky creaminess of the ice cream made me swoon. The crunchy, sweet-salty factor from the peanut butter halvah was great and the fudge sauce was tasty as well.Our beveragesTo wash some of our food (more like just desserts) down, Dannie and I had our own tristar strawberry milk and Helen wanted a nostalgic drink of hers Lotte's Let's Be Mild Coffee. The tristar strawberry milk tasted like a refined version of a strawberry Yoo-hoo drink or any of those commercially produced, flavored dairy drinks. The milk is sweet but not very and the strawberry flavor was intense and especially not artificial.Helen's Mild Coffee looked familiar to me when I'm thinking back if I had indeed drank this before, when I took a sip, I remembered I have and I don't like it as an adult. It reminds me of coffee milk or a not-as-sweet version of the bottled Starbucks Frappuccino. In other words, diluted, milky coffee for my tastebuds. I think you've read long enough to know that I love strong espresso and coffee.Moving on to other sweets:We originally ordered three slices of cake: the dulce de leche, chocolate, and pistachio. To give you the story in a quasi-short way, we gotten another slice of chocolate chip by accident since it seems like they've been confused with the orders. I've pointed it out that we have gotten our chocolate chip, they've given it to us for gratis. As for the slice of pie you see on the lower right hand corner above, that's the candy bar pie as a replacement for the pistachio cake I wanted (they ran out somehow and it's about 12 PM). I think the guys behind the counter knew that my heart was broken and they've given us the replacement (the pie) and before I left, they've given me a few very warm, yet too soft for them to sell, cornflake-marshmallow, chocolate chip cookies (isn't that a mouthful to say?). How sweet.Going back to the cakes that we did ingest, the dulce de leche (photo on top left) was very moist and the crumb was fine and it's not sweet. I liked the tang of the cream cheese frosting. As for the chocolate cake (top right photo), it was probably the most tame of the bunch we've eaten. The chocolate is intense but it's not terribly sweet (which is a good thing) but nothing really stood out in my mind. The chocolate chip cake (we've eaten out from Helen's slice) was my favorite. I love the passionfruit curd's flavor that exudes the proper amount of zing on my palate. Finally, the candy bar pie looks like a Snicker's bar (nougat, chocolate cookie crust and milk chocolate covered, caramel, and peanuts) but in pie form and topped with salted pretzels. This pie was terribly sweet for me but Helen's on Cloud 9.As we've tried our hardest to eat all of these sweets, we couldn't. We asked for a box to save up these sweets (I couldn't bear the thought of throwing them away) and waddled our way around, trying to breathe.Address: Momofuku Milk Bar & Bakery 207 2nd Avenue (Entrance on 13th Street) New York, NY 10003 (map )

I've read so much about this place over the past week and overall its gotten pretty good reviews...Being the dessert lover I am, I will definitely have to check it out... i was going to try and go early this morning and get the egg and pork bun for breakfast but i overslept :( so it'll have to wait for another day...p.s. there is nothing more soothing, and that has such a nurturing feeling as a nice shot or three of espresso enjoyed at a leisurely pace. sublime!!!!

VeggieGirl: Oh yeah... I had a hard time breathing for a few minutes after eating all of that!Mikey V: It's pretty damn good from what I've tried.This afternoon (I forgot my camera so there's no food porn unfortunately), the egg muffin and the banana cake. The former was tasty. I liked the bacon but I wish the egg was a tad more undercooked. As for the banana cake, it is one of my faves from here - crunchy gianduja filling, moist banana cake whose flavor is quite intense. (Chocolate chip is my other favorite.)Just order your triple espresso (for me, triple macchiato :)) from a nearby coffeeshop (e.g. Abraço, Everyman Espresso, Joe. etc.) then fill yourself on the sweets.Mike: Nope. After hearing and reading about the crack pie, it doesn't appeal to me. It's mostly made of brown sugar, cream, sugar, butter, a touch of corn flour; definitely no crack.

Oh man, didn't even know Momofuku had opened a milk bar/sweet shop. The stuff looks awesome. Awww, another excuse to try to get to NY from the West Coast in 2009.

I will a little surprised that they were $9!  I made them at home and on my blog for pennies.  $2/lb for belly.  Its the best I can do for being all the way out in california.

La Maison du Chocolat's Opening Party

[I'm interrupting the dinner portion of my belated birthday post. Hopefully, it'll be up early next week.]The invite...Early last week I've received an invitation from La Maison du Chocolat. I thought \"ZOMG!\" If you haven't known this by now, I love everything from LMDC, especially their chocolates, so it's a reflex for me to RSVP. But I have to wonder, isn't this considered bad timing to open a new luxurious boutique in this awful state of our economy? I wouldn't know but I can't say \"no\" a party.After work, I've hauled my butt from work (with Helen in tow), get squished by commuters to take the downtown 6 and 4 train, respectively, to get to Wall Street.Putting in the final touchesSighing from relief and trying to get non-recycled air into our lungs, Helen and I walked down Wall Street to a short red-velvet rope that's in front of the entrance. An employee checked off my name from the list and we're allowed to enter, seeing several people putting in the final touches for this fête.Bubbly passed aroundAs any party would start off, the mustard yellow-uniformed servers passed out silver trays of Champagne from Pommery and San Pelligrino sparkling water with slices of lemon or lime.LOTS of peopleThe problem with this party is that it seems like they overextended their invitations that all of the party-goers are packed like it's rush hour. No one can really move around in this small store and have to live with the little bumps and excuse mes. But I guess no one really cares about the latter since they're all drinking it up and starting to eat food.Trays of FOOD (from top left, clockwise): puffs with Gruyere fondue, pumpkin soufflé with marscapone cheese, seared tuna with wasabi cream, prosciutto rolled with foie gras, potato purée with caviar, and beef carpaccio with Parmesan cheese crispWhomever LMDC hired as their catering company, did a pretty good job. All the hors d'ouerves were fancy and most were delicious. Helen and I really liked the seared tuna rolled in a sesame crust, topped with wasabi cream (classic pairing), puffs filled with Gruyere fondue topped with a walnut (liked warm, gooey cheese and its sharpness, as well as the earthiness of the walnut), prosciutto rolled with foie gras, filled with fig jam in the center was my favorite (saltiness of the prosciutto and foie gras, the sexy, creamy texture of the foie and the fig jam brought in some sweetness).The ones that were good but not as great were the beef carpaccio with Parmesan crisp (good beef but nothing stood out in my mind) and pumpkin soufflé with marscapone cheese topped with pistachio (good but it wasn't pumpkin-y enough).The least liked was the potato purée with a type of cheese (I forgot which one) topped with caviar. The flavors were flat, meaning that I tasted the saltiness of the cheese and caviar for half a second and then I tasted heavy potato that was bland. Meh.Just in case you needed more food pornAnd there's sweets...And there's more... Obviously, La Maison du Chocolat can't have a party without sampling out their famous chocolates and macarons, along with a few interesting concoctions. There's a warm, spicy chocolate ganache (practically the consistency of their hot chocolate) topping off a mix of nuts; I thought it was good but I'm not too fond of the chocolate and chile combination. The one I do like more was a half shot glass of Pommery Champagne with a halved Salvador chocolate (the raspberry ganache covered in dark chocolate couverture) - the Champagne tasted like raspberries and vice versa; a flavor combination I like.Blackberry macaron innardsThe macarons were obviously delicious. They served all of their flavors - chocolate, raspberry, caramel, and coffee - but the one I've never encountered before was the blackberry macaron. It has all the characteristics of a good macaron (thin, crisp outer shell meets fluffy, moist crumb, both filling and cookie taste like what it's supposed to taste like naturally), the blackberry flavor was sharp and not too sweet. Why haven't I eat this before?They're longing to be insideThe party was fun. Good food, good alcohol (if you like your Champagne) and rubbing the wealthy's elbows, literally. After an hour and forty minutes of partying, the LMDC employees wanted to kick us all of us out because there's others waiting outside the door.As a parting gift, they gave each of us a small, 12-piece box of LMDC chocolates. Awesome.LMDC chocolates, woot.Address: La Maison du Chocolat 63 Wall Street New York, NY 10005 (map)

[sobs]You should try LMDC's macarons but PH's always the best in my book (actually, my palate and stomach).misstiffie: The chocolates are the usual but very delicious things; nothing really new if you've eaten them before.It ain't cheap to buy them, that's for sure. I've bought one to many over the years of consumption. :p

Great news - we now have one in NYC!  I just spent two and half weeks in Paris and went in and out of the various MDC stores there.  I thought I was going to have to wait for a return trip to Paris...Why Wall St, though?

My birthday celebration: Part 1 - Cakes, Drinks and Fried Hot Dogs

***CONTENT
The past Friday afternoon my boss sort of surprised me for my birthday.What happened was my boss inquired me the past week when's my birthday since I've sent out a mass e-mail to share out my week-early birthday cake to my co-workers (see photo here).She managed to remember my birthday (despite of her busy schedule) and asked one of my other co-workers, Deniz to pick up my birthday cakes. I remember seeing her rushing into my boss's office that morning lugging in two large shopping bags, making me wonder if we're having a party? But I thought, \"Nah.\" Eventually my boss sent out a mass email indicating that we're celebrating my birthday with birthday cakes at the conference room. I thought I was dyslexic for several minutes thinking that I'm reading \"cakes\" and it should be singular.My Birthday CAKES(?)!But was my assumption WRONG! Deniz actually did indeed bought FOUR cakes! I was definitely shocked that I don't know what to say except the words, \"I need to bring my camera.\" Escaped from my mouth and took photos of these babies.So what did we have? Three small cakes from Two Little Red Hens (pumpkin cake with cream cheese frosting, a coconut angel food cake, and the raspberry truffle) and the pièce de résistance, a whole chocolate tart from La Maison du Chocolat. I think you all know that I LOVE good chocolate, so La Maison's tart is the best - buttery, crumbly crust (or cake?) with creamy, thick, not too sweet chocolate ganache.La Maison du Chocolat's cake innardsAs for the Two Little Red Hens' cakes, they're very good. All were moist with good crumb but my least liked was the pumpin with cream cheese frosting. I found it too heavy. The favorite was the coconut angel food cake - feathery light, not too sweet and the cake is moist. Eating three of the four cakes made me full and kind of regret eating so much since I planned dinner...After work, I haphazardly planned at the last minute practically for my birthday dinner. Long story that you don't need to know but a few friends managed to pull through. So, Helen and I met up and went to Crif Dogs since we're too early for the rest of the group to enter right next door (or more like their cocktail lounge), PDT.Tsunami DogHelen was hungry so while we're awaiting for Giulia and Seungmi to arrive, she ordered the tsunami dog - a deep fried hot dog that is bacon wrapped and topped with teriyaki, pineapple and green onions. It sounds like a Helen-compatible hot dog to me. She said this was good. I didn't try it because I wanted to save stomach space.PDT's sceneSince this is a Friday night, it's not surprising that PDT is pretty much booked a little past 6 PM. Most of the bar-goers look like they just came out of work and wanted to relax with a few drinks. Since I have a party of four, I can't sit at the bar and we ended up having a table at the back.Clockwise from top left: Norman Inversion, French Maid, The Great Pumpkin, and another drink that I forgot the name ofWe liked all of our drinks (we took sips of each others' to get a taste of each) and they're all perfectly balanced in terms of sweetness and the sharpness of the alcohol. My Great Pumpkin cocktail looks like a cappuccino (from the use of the whole egg, shaken) and it's nicely spiced and the pumpkin flavor is not too strong, which is fine. It's a fine seasonal cocktail. Seungmi's French Maid is very refreshing and light which suits her tastes. Giulia's Norman Inversion tasted sweet yet balanced. Helen's cocktail (which I forgot the name, unfortunately) was fruity and slightly sweet.Chang Dog and the Wylie Dog, respectivelyBesides having PDT's great cocktails, we must have their fried hot dogs. They're made from the same kitchen of Crif Dogs but the creations are only sold and made for PDT. Anyway, we ordered the Chang Dog and the Wylie Dog. I never had the Chang Dog (named after the Momofuku brand owner and chef, David Chang) before and I like spicy food so I split it with Seungmi. It was delicious. A bacon-wrapped, fried hot dog topped with kimchi. Mmmm...it's so good yet so bad for my arteries.The same applies to the Wylie Dog (named after executive chef/owner Wylie Dufrense of wd-50), except the latter hot dog is topped with fried mayonnaise, tomato molasses, and shredded Romaine lettuce.After we're done with our food and drinks, we paid our check and walked downtown to our dinner destination...(stay tuned).Address: Crif Dogs & PDT Bar 113 St. Marks Place New York, NY 10009 (map)

My (Early) Birthday Lunch at Eleven Madison Park

They personalized itBack last Wednesday (my actual birthday was yesterday, Sunday), I splurged my own lunch early for my birthday at Eleven Madison Park. I remembered liking this place a lot when I visited here over a year ago (for their tasting menu, not counting Restaurant Week) and I'm still hearing raves about the food.Elegant flowersSo, I thought it's about time to come back to this place since this place is suited for special occasions and/or business lunches. The latter is more predominant when I went there. Almost every table, people were dressed in suits. I only spotted one party with a casual look (i.e. nice jeans and shirt) toward the latter end of my two-hour lunch. Despite of what seems like a corporate crowd, the conversations were still lively.Amuse BoucheGoing all out for my birthday, I ordered the Gourmand menu which started with the amuse bouche of a bold lobster bisque, with a small disc of crab meat and chestnuts. Taking a spoon of each element, I never thought of a soup ever being so intense, melding so well with the sweet crab meat and the crunchy chestnuts playing as little high notes to this symphony of flavors. All I could think of was \"Wow.\"Picholine olive mini-baguette and butter and saltThen we move on to the bread service, where I chose a picholine olive mini-baguette served along with their unsalted butter. The bread was noticeably of better quality than what I had from the previous visits - über crisp crust meets salty, moist crumb. The unsalted butter from Vermont was very soft, creamy and spreadable. I would eat the entire thing but I needed to save room for the remaining six courses.Garden PotatoesThe first course, garden potatoes with Balik salmon and watercress, was quite amazing. The tiny, baby, confitted potatoes, draped with thick slices of Balik salmon, small mounds of salty salmon roe with a small swath of potato foam. The potato foam was lightener of all the heady components of the dish while the saltiness of the salmon was balanced out by the potatoes.Foie gras terrine with golden pineappleMoving on to one of my favorite courses, the foie gras terrine with golden pineapple served along with a lightly toasted round of rum-raisin brioche and pineapple curd topped with pineapple foam was a dish that's reached to orgasmic proportions. If you do like foie gras, this is one of the best examples served in New York City. The creamy, earthy liver contrasted with the acidic and sweet pineapple cubes. Topping it with the accompanied rum-raisin brioche and the pineapple curd and foam, it lightens the denseness of the foie gras.Brioche and pineapple curd and foamClose up of the Maine Diver Scallops and Hawaiian PrawnsThe seafood course was the Maine diver scallops and Hawaiian prawns with cauliflower and crustacean jus. I never thought of seafood being so sweet. The diver scallop was beautifully caramelized and the prawns were perfectly cooked. Both were intensely saccharine that it astounded my mind. The cauliflower played along the sweetness of the seafood, as well as adding a subtle crunchy note.The suckling pig of my dreamsI've requested to substitute the Four Story Hill Poussin dish with the Vermont Suckling Pig Confit with Cipollini onions, plum chutney, and five spice jus, since I remember eating the former the last time I tried their Gourmand menu. Thankfully, there weren't any issues substituting that dish. Anyway, this is the suckling pig of my dreams. The crisp, crackly pig skin meets fork-tender, sweet pork meat, adding the caramelized Cipollini onion and plum chutney created fireworks on my tongue. I think tears were about to well up in my eyes as I ate it. It's no question that it is and meant to be the signature dish of EMP.Milk chocolate paletteI finally moved on to dessert. By now, my stomach is saying to me \"I'm full\" but I can't refuse dessert. Actually, I don't think I ever have. Anyway, this milk chocolate palette with Bosc pears and chestnuts was good but wasn't as remarkable as the savory courses were. The palate was crisp and the Bosc pears and chestnuts added some dimension to the sweetness and crunch to the dessert but it lacked that \"wow\" factor.MignardisesTo conclude this two-hour lunch fest, I was bestowed with a long, narrow dish of mignardes. They're two sets of miniature, bite-sized cookies - a wee raspberry chocolate macaron, pistachio-raspberry financier, a butter cookie filled with lemon curd and a rich chocolate peanut butter cup. Frankly, I liked the mignardes more than the dessert I had earlier.After finishing my mignardes, I asked for the check and paid and strolled my way out, astounded about this amazingly delicious meal.Address: Eleven Madison Park 11 Madison Avenue (off of 24th Street) New York, NY 10010 (map)

It's a great room-I'll have to revisit now that the current chef has had time to settle in. When I last went with my wife, we were underwhelmed, but I assume that had to do with a changing of the guard at the time...But as always, DM's restaurants have gracious service and excellent rooms/ambience.And those treats at the end (when you feel like you are about to explode) are just great at the end...!Happy Birthday Tina!best, dbdtron

Happy bday :)I was wondering did you go alone? If so, how accepting/comfortable did you feel in the environment... also... and this might be too \"forward\" but could you give me an estimate of the total (did this include any alcohol?)Just wondering because there are many times where I find myself wanting to make a splurge like this on myself to celebrate an occasion and am tired of not being able to find anyone to accompany me (or at least no one being able to afford to accompany me)...

Parisien1: Thank you for the birthday wishes!dbtron: I don't know when you actually went there when Chef Humm took over the helms of EMP but I guess it is the time issue.Yes, Danny Meyer restaurants are always have gracious and impeccable service and the atmosphere is wonderful.Thanks for the birthday wishes! :DVeggieGirl: Ditto! :)MikeyV: Thanks.I went there solo. The Gourmand (tasting) menu was $58 pre-tax, so I paid a little over $72 after tax and tip. (You may find the menu by Googling it or clicking on their name when I mentioned it the first time.) No alcohol since I have to haul my butt back to work.

awesome thanks for the reply!!! I'll definitely have to give it a try... i just checked out the menu online and it seems like a steal for the price...and p.s. i just remembered I was the guy that made that pumpkin pie oh-my for you at shake shack!!!i don't work there anymore unfortunately (it was probably one of the best jobs i've had...) Now i'm working at Sony doing boring clerical stuff, but I'm trying to go to culinary school and become a chef (even though i've graduated with a B.S. in computer science lol...) I totally miss the shack though :( but at least now i make enough money to actually be able to try and eat at EMP and such :)

Momofuku Ssäm Bar for lunch

***CONTENT
Mini burger, CHOMPEDA few weekends ago, I've went to brunch with Robyn, Kåre, Alex, and Kathy at Dumont Burger (that's their burger on the photo above) a few weekends ago (click here for my photo set) I'm not writing about them since it's covered by Robyn. (To keep it short and sweet about the burger, the beef patty is tasty but the ciabatta bun ain't working for me.)During brunch, Robyn and Kathy has spoken about the awesomeness of Momofuku Ssäm Bar's prix fixe lunch. Thinking about it, it's been about a year since I've eaten there and thought it's about time to haul my butt from the Upper East Side from work and eat there for lunch.This is what I'm talking about...Arriving there around 12 PM, the place is a lot more calmer compared to what I remembered during the evenings when I ate there for dinner. I grabbed a seat at the bar and practically started to order after sitting down for a few minutes.Root beer served in a Mason jarCurious about the root beer menu after talking to one of the guys working at the bar, I've ordered Sprecher's root beer since I heard it's delicious and he told me that it's very smooth. What sort of surprised me was the fact that it's served in a Mason jar - how cute. But in terms of the actual root beer, it was indeed awesome as I've heard. It's nicely spiced, smooth and drinking a whole bottle by is sort of a feat for me (it's like 14 ounces) to finish this in one sitting. It's best to share it with someone else unless you're really parched.Apple Kimchi SaladStarting off my lunch was the apple kimchi salad. I remembered eating this before and I think it tasted as good as ever. The crisp, sweet, pickled yet spicy honeycrisp apples worked well with the tangy, creamy maple labne (thick yogurt). The salty, smoky, and crisp slices of bacon added onto the crisp texture and added the lovely bacon-y pork flavor. Mmmm...Fried Brussels SproutsI added an additional course, Satur Farms fried brussels sprouts to my lunch. I can't help it since I love their version of brussels sprouts. What is there not to love about it? It's deep fried, plays with the salty (from the fish sauce), bitter and sweet (from the cooked/fried brussels sprouts), crunchy (from the puffed rice) and it sort of has a refreshing zing at the end from eating the herbs sprinkled on top. I forgot the name of it unfortunately but it tasted like cilantro but not as piquant.Spicy Rice CakesBy the time I gotten my spicy rice cakes, I was feeling full. I have to try it after Robyn telling me her love for it. I don't know if they made it hotter than what she had or they made it spicier but my mouth and esophagus felt the slow burn of chilies when I swallowed the rice cakes or practically anything from this dish. Don't get me wrong everything was tasty - the chewy (fried?) rice cakes, sweet fried shallots, and the minced pork meat. But OH GOD, I thought I was my stomach wall was going to singe. The server warned me that this dish is very spicy but I didn't expect it to be this hot. I stopped myself from eating this dish halfway and told them to wrap it up for me. I'll save it for a chile loving friend of mine.IT'S SPICY and REDPB&JAfter waving the white flag on the rice cake dish, I drank as much water I can to calm down the fires burning in my stomach. Eventually, my dessert, PB&J was set before me. This is basically a saltine panna cotta set on top of a disc of peanut crunch, sauced with concord grapes. I do like this dessert, as it plays on the nostalgic flavor combination of peanut butter and jelly, but the panna cotta was very salty if it's eaten on its own. Come to think about it, even when I had a bite with each element on it, the salty zing still remains in the background.In all, this lunch was relatively a bargain compared to what I remembered spending on dinner (except for the added root beer and brussels sprouts) and it's a lot less hectic. I just wished my tolerance for heat was a bit higher.Address: Momofuku Ssäm Bar 207 2nd Avenue (on 13th Street) New York, NY 10003 (map)

The food looks delicious...especially the apple kimchi, fried brussel sprouts and rice cakes(?) which don't' look like rice cakes. I'll have to remember it for my next trip to NYC.

Momofuku's roasted brussel sprouts are my favorite!  I always end up ordering more then one bowl.  I believe the herb on it is called delfino.  I'll have to try the root beer next time I'm there!

You MUST go there!Eat Me Outta Here: I remembered it started with the letter \"d\" but that's it! You should definitely try it if you like (or love) root beer.

The rice cake dish is very interesting. It definitely reminds me of a Malaysian \"peasant food\" recipe. Malaysians eat cubes of pressed rice, notably with satay. Leftover rice is then fried with whatever ingredients the cook fancies. Of course, it's always spicy!

The Honeycrisp Apple Kimchi & Brussels Sprouts are two of the best dishes I have had there! And, the Kimchi is a number one top taste!
This is a must if you are in NYC.  Cheers!

Hot Chocolate from Vosges, Dim Sum Feast at Chatham Square Restaurant and My First Taste of Bubble Tea

***CONTENT
The day after my [cref holiday-dinner-at-payard Payard dinner], I was crazy enough to schedule to have dim sum with my friends, Seungmi and Giulia, whom I haven't seen for months. I love these girls to death but hell, my stomach's filled with French food and desserts and after that evening, I thought I couldn't eat anymore. Obviously, I underestimated my hunger... Since I've anticipated this brunch, if you will, I skipped breakfast (unless you consider a cup of coffee and a banana, breakfast) and wandered around SoHo in the search of pretty wrapping paper and ribbons. (It's Kate's Paperie, if you really want to know). Yes, I have a weird obsession for good quality paper that's obscenely expensive (it's priced by sheet and it's no bigger than a normal-sized poster) and pleat them to my little heart's content. If you ever talked to my friends about receiving gifts from me, they'll tell you how insane I am.Eventually, I got hungry from roaming around and since I don't want to fill my stomach with food, I thought getting a steamy cup of hot chocolate should suffice. The closest place to get such a thing was Vosges Haut Chocolat.Aztec Hot Chocolate & Chocolate BarI ended up getting a tall glass of Aztec hot chocolate and an organic \"Enchanted Mushrooms\" chocolate bar. The hot chocolate was still very good in terms of texture, not too thick but creamy enough; heated well enough that the glass can potentially scald my cold fingers, and it had a good hit of chocolate. What disappointed me was the fact that they made the spiciness milder. I was hoping for a slightly bolder, smoky, peppery kick that I remember tasting last year or so.As for the mushroom chocolate bar, it wasn't as good as I hoped. The bitter dark chocolate and finely chopped walnuts dominated the mushroom flavor, making it gritty and not mushroom-y.I realized that I was running late to brunch as Giulia called my cell phone and I have to haul my ass down to Chinatown to Chatham Square Restaurant.Giulia and I met at the waiting area of the restaurant for the not-so-good-sense-of-direction-but-oh-so-adorable Seungmi arrived. We've gotten seated immediately since the bitter cold and icy pavement probably scared potential diners but the dining room was about 95% filled. Not too bad.As we all finally got seated, I've started to order. Here's the highlights:Fried Taro BallsFried taro balls (Wu gok) were awesome. Ethereally crisp with layers of wispy, thin fried batter with mashed taro stuffed with diced shiitake mushrooms, pork. Mmm...Steamed meatballsSteamed meatballs with tofu skin were nice and beefy. It helps that they added some Worcestershire sauce to give it some extra tang.Char siu souChar siu sou are always welcome to my belly. These flaky pastries are one of my absolute favorite dishes. They're filled with diced roast pork.Shu MaiThe shu mai was pretty good. The unfortunate fact was that Giulia and Seungmi has issues with shrimp. But strangely enough, Seungmi took her chances with her digestive system and eaten two and slathered some sriracha sauce on them. Giulia and I thought she lost it and she'll be asking for one painful heartburn.Stuffed rice noodle rolls: shrimp and beefThen we eaten cheong fun. Rice noodle rolls that's filled with beef or shrimp. Obviously I've eaten the entire plate of shrimp noodle rolls (as I've mentioned why a moment ago). They're soft, chewy pillows of noodles that has some tasty protein.When the dessert cart rolled by us, I've spotted an unusual dish where I saw something small, spiky and baked. I've stopped the lady and asked her, \"What is it?\" She told me in Cantonese (when literally translated) it's called \"pig-pig\" buns. Since I never encountered such a thing in my entire life eating dim sum food, I've ordered one.Edible cuteness!But I didn't expect these adorable porcupine-shaped buns. Awww... They're too cute. All of us were staring at these babies for a while, contemplating whether or not we should eat it or not. Of course, we each taken one and started to nosh.InnardsThese little buns were filled with crisp layers of peanut butter, encased with a baked, soft bun.Egg custard tartsEgg custard tarts were extremely flaky and the not-too-sweet, eggy custard filling were quite good.Fried salty dumplingsHaam sui gaau means literally, salty water dumplings. They're basically dumplings that were fried, filled with savory items like finely ground pork, shrimp, and mushrooms encased with a sticky rice flour dough.Mini fried sesame ballsJien duy or fried sesame balls are another of my favorite dim sum dishes. Basically, it's rice flour dough filled with lotus seed or red adzuki bean paste, rolled in sesame seeds and deep fried.I LOVE YOU!What made it awesome was the fact they're filled with lotus seed paste. I'm having a harder time finding this particular filling in this dessert as well as getting cans of these in Chinese markets.After finishing dim sum, I asked for the check, paid it and walked around Chinatown for the purpose of food shopping for my mom. She wanted me to pick some stuff up on the way since I'm there.If you want my opinion about their food, they're good but not excellent. Next time, I shall venture to Flushing instead.Eventually, we're getting our butts frozen from wandering around Chinatown that Giulia and Seungmi were craving hot bubble tea. Honestly, I never tried it before and am never interested in those tea concoctions.Ten-Ren Tea's (Stark) InteriorDespite my indifference to bubble tea, I won't be a party pooper and we walked into Ten Ren Tea. Stark decor and they're playing music relatively loud.Hot Assam black tea with tapioca pearlsSeungmi gotten herself a cup of hot Assam black tea with tapioca pearls. When I tried a spoon of it, it affirmed my beliefs with bubble tea: I don't hate it. I don't love it. I'm simply indifferent. The black tea was slightly sweetened, not cloyingly so. The bubble part of the tea, tapioca pearls, was chewy and I think it turned me off from liking it. I know a lot of you people reading this now are screaming at me, \"ARE YOU NUTS?! WHAT KIND OF ASIAN ARE YOU?!\"Rose TeaMoving onto Giulia's hot rose tea, it's slightly sweetened and I didn't taste much of roses. It smells lightly floral but I don't taste it. Not bad but I was expecting something different.Addresses:Vosges Haut Chocolat 132 Spring Street (between Greene & Wooster Streets) New York, NY 100 (map)Chatham Square Restaurant 6 Chatham Square (between Mott & Doyers Streets) New York, NY 10038 (map)Ten Ren Tea 79 Mott Street (between Canal & Bayard Streets) New York, NY 10013 (map)

My friends ask me the same thing when I tell them that I have yet to try bubble tea. \"What kind of Asian are you?!\". Well, I'm the one who is slightly freaked out about black balls floating in her tea! One day, I will suck it up though... Those little peanut butter balls look so interesting. I want to make my own! We don't have that great of dim sum places where I live but I crave it 24/7.Have a good new year! I'm looking forward to a tasty 2009!

Melissa: Thanks for reading! You should go and try dim sum!VeggieGirl: Happy new year to you, too!Amanda: I guess we're one of the rare percentage of the Asian population who doesn't like bubble tea. I'm not alone! :)As for the peanut butter buns, they're cute and I don't think I would want to bake 'em. My parents don't LOVE peanut butter; just like them.Happy new year to you, too!

OMG, those porcupine pastries look so cute, and you know what, i love peanut butter!!!  i'll have to get them next time.although, if they were filled with some sort of offal, it would probably make more sense to have them animal shaped. but, then again, that would probably take away the cuteness factor.

Holiday Dinner at Payard

Payard's exteriorLast Friday, my former boss (sort of - it's complicated) invited me to his lab's holiday dinner. Problem was, his current assistant told me about his plans the last minute (technically, three days prior to the dinner) and needed some suggestions as to where to eat. Thankfully, me being the crazy, food-lovin' girl that I am I figured we should go to Payard. It's close to work, the food's good from what I heard (I only tried their desserts), it's within the budget he wanted to work with and they have vegetarian options. All of us filed into the relatively quiet restaurant at 6 PM (it snowed that day and the streets were wet and slushy), checked our coats and been escorted upstairs where we've been divided into two tables. Not exactly a desired arrangement but at least the view was nice from here.Our viewEventually, our waiter in his faux-French, accented English told us the evening's specials and talked a little bit about the prix fixe menu. We all noticed that and found it very annoying. Anyway, we discussed out loud what are certain things on the menu (not all of them are foodies) and made up our minds what we wanted to eat.Bowls of SoupWhat I remembered seeing (and taking photos of) for the first course, we all settled for chestnut soup with Fuji apple and Champignons de Paris with croutons and the fennel soup with red pepper coulis and crouton. The chestnut soup tasted like mushrooms rather than chestnuts. It only had the texture of pureed chestnuts though. As for the apple, you only get small dices that's on top of the soup but it doesn't have much flavor to it. The fennel soup at least tasted like fennel and it's quite viscous. I do like the red pepper coulis on top, imparting a slight zip to the earthy soup.Main coursesMoving on to the main courses, the other table had a vegetarian who ordered a potato tart that's encased in a puff pastry. Another person ordered the classic cassoulet with tarbais beans, duck confit, Toulouse sausage, pork shank and fresh bacon. It sounded good and with ton of meat was cooked in there but I didn't taste either dishes. As for the remainder of the table, they ordered the pork chop with lemon crust, crispy polenta, bok choy and chanterelles with a black mission fig-pork jus (which I had it myself). My pork chop was a tad overcooked than what I would like since I had a relatively tough time cutting through my slab of meat; the remaining accouterments to the dish was generally fine, nothing earth shattering. A few others had the steak frites, roasted, stuffed chicken, and the classic bouillabaisse with Chilean sea bass. From what it seems like from their reactions to their dishes, they liked it.Caffeinated beveragesWe've slowly progressed onto our dessert courses, which a few (like me) ordered espressos and cappuccinos. My espresso shot was fine; it's bold, robust, and slightly bitter but I wish there was better crema. There wasn't any at all. As for a few of my companions who ordered cappuccino, their drinks had an unusually large cap of milk foam with a dusting of cinnamon on top. Honestly, I haven't encountered this particular style for nearly a decade. Perhaps they're trying to go old-school before the coffee revolution?A whole bunch of desserts for each tableGenerally speaking, the desserts fared a bit better than the savory courses. I did like the green tea creme brulee a lot. It was a huge enough to serve four people; smooth, creamy and the burnt sugar crust was brittle like glass when the spoon tapped it.Since all of us were lazy to get our butts out of our seats to look at their pastry cases as to what we would like to eat individually, the waiter ended up choosing our assortment of cakes to share family-style. Most were familiar to me like the Chinon and Beaux-Arts - they're the signature cakes and they are deemed to be designated as such. Hopefully, you do like pistachio and raspberry to like either of these. As for the remainder, there was a chocolate chiboust tart (I love chocolate and hazelnuts), a chocolate cake which I don't remember, a Mont Saint Michel (was fine; nothing extraordinary), Notre Dame (I like the smooth chocolate), and a seasonal pear crumble tart (it's not my favorite; too little pear flavor).The most disappointing dessert to me was their Cendrillon; composed of pumpkin mousse, cranberry gelée and pumpkin sponge cake. The orange exterior was fluorescent orange. I mean, it's like the orange color is on steroids that one would think of as Halloween. When I took a bite, the pumpkin flavor was taken over by the oddly paired cranberry gelée; tasting a strong acidic note then eventually a hint of pumpkin. It was weird. I didn't like it at all.Group photoWe've reached to a food coma by the time we're done with dessert. After digesting for ten minutes or so, I took a group photo of all of the lab members and a few of their significant others.Overall, this dinner was simply fine. I wasn't expecting to be \"wowed.\" But considering the price of this dinner ($37 per person, pre-tax & tip) and where the lab wanted to be located for dinner, this wasn't too shabby.Address: Payard 1032 Lexington Avenue (between 73rd & 74th Street) New York, NY 10021 (map)

Your review is pretty much on par with every review I've ever read from a foodie about Payard- the service is pretentious(and many times lacking), the food is okay(but nothing more than okay) and no one can quite figure out why this place has such a big reputation.

I would go to food war with you... if only I lived in New York City I would be happy; fat, but happy.  You and your blog have been a regular part of 2008 for me.  Your written descriptions and your photographs more often than not make me want to jump on Amtrak and find a table to sample whatever it is that YOU'VE just eaten.  All the best for a happy, health and foodie 2009.

bronxelf: I guess so. If the lab would have wanted to travel downtown, we could do sooo much better. Alas, they didn't. :(In regards to Payard, I guess his reputation as a great pastry chef probably propelled the thought that the restaurant would be \"amazing.\" Don't get me wrong, I do think Francois Payard is a very good or excellent pastry chef but not all of his dessert creations are magnificent. As for the savory food, well, that needed to be improved upon.steveTV: Umm...do you mean you want to go out \"fooding\" with me? (As in, eat out with me?) If so, WE SHOULD! That's if you ever will be coming over to NYC.Thanks for reading my blog and breaking your silence! Happy new year! :)

It would be my pleasure.  My daughter goes to Fordham so I get up there from DC rather regularly.  I actually know a couple places on Arthur Avenue but am very impressed with the variety and quality of your selections so would much rather you choose.
thewanderingeater
2008-12-29 23:34:00
steveTV: I haven't been to Arthur Avenue before. Perhaps this would call for a fooding field trip? Or you're up for anything?Either way, if you do happen to drop in Manhattan, please do e-mail me so we could arrange a certain date and time to have lunch or a multiple destination food outing.

He's cuuutteAin't that little Santa adorable? This was a little cake topper from my co-worker's birthday cake a few days ago. It's made of colored meringue.So, Merry Christmas! Happy Hanukkah! And for some eventually, Happy Kwanzaa! May you all have a safe one filled with LOTS OF GOOD FOOD! :D Thanks to all of you to make this weird obsession of mine worthwhile. Through this blog, I've made virtual friends and eventually, friends meeting in the flesh. It's a great and wonderful feeling to know that you all support me (silently or actually commenting on my posts).P.S. I shall post my dinner at Payard with (former) co-workers and a dim sum lunch with my friends Giulia and Seungmi soon.On a side note, does ANYONE know what the heck is going on with the Canon EOS 5D Mark II camera? With the exception of Amazon.com's insanely overpriced body (albeit from a third party seller), many other places are back ordered, WTF?!

Um, a zillion pro photographers pre-ordered it the day it came out or shortly thereafter, and now production can't keep up? Amazon had it available for pre-order for a while, then took it down because demand was too high.

Kathryn: As much as the 5D Mark II is a highly anticipated camera, I wouldn't have thunk a lot of people would swoop in for the camera in bad economic times.At least I could wait until I go to vacation (in HK & some cities in China next spring or so)!
kathryn
2008-12-30 03:12:00
@tina: well, a lot of people pre-ordered it the week it was announced, before the economy went South. And if you are dependent on your SLR for your living (and your old 5D is dying), it's hard to say no. People have been waiting for this camera for almost 3 years.

A Brief Dinner at Picholine

Picholine's menu coverTwo Fridays ago, I've arranged a small dinner with Robyn, Jess, and her roommate, Jen to Picholine's bar/lounge. Why? It's because I'm intrigued by their menu, it's relatively affordable compared to their main dining room's menu and we're not dying of starvation. As we waited a bit for a table to free up in this small area, we've talked updated each other about our lives since most of us haven't seen each other for a bit. Also, observing the restaurant and the lounge, it's filled with diners are generally at least a decade older than all of us. The atmosphere is very refined, you smell the heady musk of cheese and edible mold, and as Jen said when we left the restaurant, \"stuffy.\" Probably, I could live with it but I guess it's not for everyone.Eventually, we got seated and decided what we wanted to try from the \"tasting flights.\" So here's what we all ordered:From top: From top: Chestnut Pheasant Veloute, Foie Gras Explosion & Sweetbreads (Robyn's & Jen's tasting plates)Robyn and Jen ordered the same thing - unintentionally. They both wanted the chestnut pheasant veloute, foie gras explosion, and the sweetbreads. I've tried Robyn's veloute and found it pretty delicious. Thick, rich and creamy soup that's slightly flavored with chestnuts and has that viscous texture of it when it's blended. The pheasant flavor was veering toward the neutral side. But the few shavings of black truffles made this soup a bit decadent. I'll write about the foie gras explosion and the sweetbreads later on since I have them myself.Jess's tasting plateAs for Jess's flight, she wanted to be different than the rest of us by having the Wagyu beef a la Basque, exotic fruit soup, and sea scallops cru. Honestly, I haven't tasted anything but her fruit soup, which basically passion fruit soup that was wonderfully vibrant and balanced with sweet and tart. She told me the other items on her plate was simply \"good.\"My tasting plateFinally for me, I've ordered the PX sherry sorbet with serrano ham chips, foie gras explosion, and sweetbreads. I have to wonder what did I think of when I ordered the PX sherry sorbet? I have a ridiculously low alcohol tolerance and I still ordered this tasting. Anyway, this sherry sorbet was exceptionally strong in terms of sherry flavor and alcohol content, as well as slightly sweet, dark, and syrupy when I let it dissolve onto my palate. When I let Jen and Jess try my sorbet, they all commented that \"it's strong and boozy.\" The salty, serrano ham chips along with this cold, slushy, concoction kind of lost me. It's interesting in terms of playing with temperatures on the palate but my tastebuds can't get over the fact that I'm tasting alcohol with a touch of salty ham at the end.Moving onto the other dishes, the sweetbreads this is my favorite dish. The sweetbreads was cooked correctly - creamy-firm texture and it's crisp on the outside. The heirloom beets and mustard-caper emulsion added some flavor to otherwise a relatively bland offal and made a bit lighter and complex. The foie gras explosion with gizzards and frisée was the most disappointing. I didn't experience any \"explosion\" from it. It's just a thin raviolo, if you will, filled with a touch of foie gras. No flavors exploded, nothing physically exploded from the thin pasta shell. I was befuddled why they named it \"foie gras explosion.\"Chocolates & Petit FoursThey actually included a miniature dessert course of chocolates and petit fours. The chocolate bon bons (flavors included were mint, lemon, milk chocolate feuilletine, dark chocolate truffle, and another flavor that I can't remember) were generally good but not amazing. The petit fours were basically a small cake stand of bite sized: Florentine cookie, Linzer cookie, almond financiers, chocolate cakes, apricot filled tarts, and apricot pâté de fruits. These fared a bit better but still on the small rationed side for sharing amongst us four.Overall, I think the \"tasting flights\" menu has some hits and misses like any menu would have. It's not too awful spending three tastings for $20. I need to try out the dining room's food to have a fuller perspective.Address: Picholine (Lounge/Bar area) 35 West 64th Street (between Broadway & Central Park West) New York, NY 10023 (map)

Apologies for the belated reply.Helen: Well, you should but then again, I hope you weren't starving if you went.belltowngirl: Thanks! You should give it a whirl.Michael: It's $20 for three items. It's now listed on their Menu as \"Menu d'Economie.\"Tasty trekker: This meal was pretty small. (We weren't hungry.) Each item was about 2-7 bites. It's not for the eaters who like hefty portions. They're tasting portions like what one would get at Eleven Madison Park, if you (or anyone else) have tried.

Another Lunch at Momofuku Ssäm Bar & Bakery

Apologies for not posting the past few weeks. I'm getting lazy with the posting and with the holidays coming, I've been busy buying and wrapping presents and writing Christmas cards. Damn the post office line being ridiculously long...I went to Momofuku Ssäm Bar (yes, again) a few weeks ago with Giulia. Why did I go there again? Well, for two reasons: One, I kept mentioning about their luscious, fatty pork buns on a lot of different food conversations that it piqued her interest. And two, I never took her there. So, it's about time to take her there as a de-stressing lunch after she took one of the many law school finals that will come on the later weeks, on Monday.Menu boardAs usual, I'm early for my lunch date and I was hungry. So, I plopped into Momofuku Milk Bar & Bakery for a relatively light bite before the actual lunch with Giulia.Banana Green Curry BreadAfter perusing on the menu board and looking at the pastry cases to see what's available, I opted for the banana green curry bread since that's pretty much what I haven't tried so far. Basically, it's a thick slice of banana bread slathered with green curry butter; toasted until the butter is melted completely. For my slice, the side that touch the griddle was a bit too burnt but I could deal with it. The entire combination was interesting - flavorful, moist banana bread with a warm, zing from the curry butter that's melted throughout the toast. The slight drawback was that it's a tad too greasy. A nice snack while I'm waiting. Then I walked over to the Ssam Bar proper and got seated at the bar.Eventually Giulia showed up, exchanged hugs, and we started to order by sharing the prix fixe menu.Pork bunsAs promised, I've finally introduced to her the pork buns. These lovely pair of steamed buns were brushed with salty hosin sauce then lined with cucumbers, luscious, fatty pork belly, and scattered with chopped, green scallions. The nice addition is the hot sauce they give you the option to amp up the heat. While we're eating them, Giulia commented she understands why I love these buns - it's made of pork and it's tasty.Grilled BranzinoOut of the entree choices from the prix fixe, the only thing that I haven't eaten (and I don't want to eat any more turkey), was the grilled branzino. Two filleted slabs of branzino that's been grilled enough to have a nice char and crisp crust while still having moist meat, plated under a bed of cranberry beans and salad to go along with the fish. It's good and probably the lightest option you could get. I'm just not too thrilled with the beans - I'm not a bean loving girl mainly because of the texture (too crunchy).Blondie PieFinally, we arrive to dessert: blondie pie. I like this a bit more than the PB&J I had last time because it wasn't as salty. The slight issue with eating this pie was that the thick filling was kind of chewy-hard that we have to stab it with a fork to get a bite. In terms of flavor, it's rich, undercooked caramel-like filling with a graham cracker crust. I like but it doesn't knock my socks off.After finishing dessert, we called it quits for eating more food since strangely enough, we're full. Since Giulia hasn't been to the bakery section of Momofuku, I took her there and she ended up buying a slice of chocolate chip cake (if you need to see what it is, click here from an earlier outing). I think she told me that it's her afternoon snack or dinner. Anyway, I had to haul my butt back to work since I ended up taking a longer lunch than I should have...Address: Momofuku Ssäm Bar & Bakery 207 2nd Avenue New York, NY 10003 (map)

I went to Momofuku Milk Bar on Wednesday! I ordered practically one of everything in the display case plus the pork and egg bun. I did not love the green curry bread -- the zing tasted very odd to me. I DID see David Chang there and basically stalked him because I'm in love with him and everything he stands for.

Veggie Girl: Yeah, I was sort of bummed but it's not that bad.Have a great Christmas, too!Jen: For going to Momofuku Milk Bar, woot! I don't exactly love the banana curry bread; just like it.Helen: LOL. The pork bun is always awesome. Even if I would die of atherosclerosis if I keep eating it monthly.

Impromptu Dinner at Momofuku Ssäm Bar

Two weeks ago, Helen and I attended an event at Bryant Park where we sampled Canadian ice wine and two different hors d'ouevrs. Obviously, this didn't make us full and the food was disappointing enough that we left under an hour and went to the East Village. Since it was a chilly evening and us being Asian, we craved a bowl of hot soup and noodles, which Helen said, \"I want to go to Ippudo.\"By the time we got there around 8:15, it's already packed - people were waiting by the door and the crowded bar area. I asked one of the hostesses that evening how long was the wait and she said, \"an hour, hour and a half at least.\" Disgruntled and not willing to wait that long for a bowl of noodles, I told Helen, \"Let's go to Momofuku [Ssäm Bar].\" And off we walked.Crowded...Despite the fact that this place was packed and buzzing with activity, we were fortunate enough to snag a table a few minutes after we walked in. A four-top just finished and the guy before us didn't have a complete party, we ended up getting the table. Woot.Charred squid saladHelen urged me to pick something I haven't eaten yet. (I HAZ INFLUENCE?! Sort of.) Anyway, we've started out with charred squid salad with ginger scallion, mizuna, and watermelon radishes. To get an idea of what this tastes like, think mildly spicy kimchi mixed with tender rings of squid and wafer-thin watermelon radishes and piquant mizuna leaves strewn around. Delicious and a great starter to our meat-filled dinner...Splitting the Crispy Pig's Head TorchonWhat drew us to the crispy pig's head torchon were the two words: crispy (= fried) and pig (= PORK). And I was loving this offal. Über crisp shell meets tender, fatty, sweet pig's head meat, topped with a sprinkling of sea salt and quartered pickled onions. The bed of adzuki beans and squirts of mustard surrounding the plate added the earthy depthness to the pork. I think I'm in love...Roasted Duck BreastThen finally, we had the roasted duck breast sitting on top of a small bed of Djion spetzle, brussels sprouts, snowed in Five Spoke cheddar. The breast meat was tender, juicy and has a nice layer of subcutaneous fat but the flavor was a bit lacking. But the savior of this dish was the luscious brick of duck confit that's found underneath. I would happily kill myself with atherosclerosis just eating that everyday. As for the other parts of the dish, the spatzle was tender with a slight kick of mustard, the brussels sprouts was sweet and added a nice crunch, while the snow of cheddar cheese added some butteriness to the dish.If you haven't gotten the hint, I do like Momofuku Ssäm Bar a lot. Hell, I'll admit I'm going there tomorrow with a friend for lunch just because she never experienced the awesome food there and she wanted to go.Address: Momofuku Ssam Bar 207 2nd Avenue (on 13th Street) New York, NY 10003 (map)

My hot cider and the mobI've remembered reading from The Feedbag about the insane line that people had to wait in order to get in during Restaurant Week. Well, I became one of those nut jobs except the good part was that the line wasn't that long (I was the third person/group seated) and yes, I did get some hot cider about three minutes prior to the actual opening. At least it made my insides a bit warm after standing out in the fairly cold weather for 15 minutes. Frankly, I was expecting worse.It's filled up As anyone would expect from this, it was fully packed within 10 minutes of opening. Even their bar was teaming up with diners in about 20 minutes.Portions of the RW menuAs you might see or read above this is the RW menu for the Tavern portion of the restaurant. It's slightly different than the Dining Room itself since it's mostly composed of the Tavern's a la carte menu.Salt & butterOnce I've ordered my food with a hot chocolate, I've received the usual salt and butter...but where's the bread?Hot chocolateThis hot chocolate was given to me about five minutes after I gotten the salt and butter. The bread is still missing. Weird. I never encountered this before and as I've observed other tables, nearly everyone else has the bread and butter served together.But to stop thinking about this minor issue, I took a sip of this large mug of hot chocolate. It was quite lovely. The white cap you see is actually whipped cream that went a bit flat but it still added a creamy texture to the not-so-viscous hot chocolate. It had nice body with a warm, cinnamon-y flavor in the background. For the dessert-lightweights, this can be considered dessert. My stomach that day thought it was for some reason.Grilled octopusMy appetizer, grilled octopus, mizuna, fennel, and ginger vinaigrette was very good. A large, meaty and tender grilled octopus tentacle worked well with the mildly peppery mizuna and spicy-sour vinaigrette. Personally, this was quite a generous portion as a starter.There you areWhile I was about to eat my grilled octopus, they finally served me bread. I know there's nothing special about this bread per se, but it's just a service issue that I can't get over in my mind.Arctic charI was feeling pescetarian that day and went for the entrée of arctic char, sunchokes, mussels, mizuna. I like arctic char because its luscious, silky texture from its flesh. The sunchokes and mussels played on the fish's sweetness. The mustard sauce added a lovely spicy, tart contrast. The sunchoke was a bit overcooked since it's soft and almost mushy (like cooked eggplant) but it still tasted good.Pear almond streusel tartWhile I felt like I was about to call it a day because the hot chocolate managed to satiate my sweet tooth but I must have an actual dessert. Especially from pastry chef, Nancy Olsen. Somehow she works her magic on her desserts and never fail to amaze me when I've dined here multiple times.What I've ordered for dessert was the pear almond streusel tart with lemon sherbet. This dessert was amazing. The sweet pear really stood out yet worked along with the buttery crust and crunchy, nutty streusel. The ratio of filling to the rest of the tart was just good enough to strike a balance. Despite the fact that it looked like there's a ton of streusel on top.The lemon sherbet highlighted the pear's essence and it was almost creamy enough to for me to think it's ice cream. I would eat an entire bucket of that sherbet; even when I actually felt like I was about to explode.Gift CertificateAnd like everyone around the Web is saying, they gave the gift certificate with the check. The (major?) modification my waitress (and other staff members) stated to us that they are accepting this certificate during lunch OR dinner within the time span of what's indicated. I never heard of this for the many years of eating out during Restaurant Week.Address:Gramercy Tavern 42 E 20th Street (between Park Ave South & Broadway) New York, NY 10003 (map)

I went to the Tavern Room about the same time you did.  All in all it was a great Restaurant Week experience.  Have you tried their chocolate bread pudding?  It's amazing.  My friend and I swear, we're going to have to do a tasting of all of their desserts one day.

Jessica: It's doubtful. I tend to post my food experiences a day (or more) later than what it should be. I went to Gramercy Tavern on Tuesday.As for their bread pudding, nope. I don't really care for bread pudding that much. But I do love pastry chef Olsen's desserts and probably would do a dessert tasting too... I hope I wouldn't die from gluttony and/or sugar coma before I have to go back to work.

Great pictures! I ate two out of the three things you had during their first day of RW. The octopus was super tender, they did an amazing job with that, and the pear tart was yum too.

After much delay, I'm back! WEEEE!![Doing a funny dance around in front of my laptop...]I know this site looks ugly for the time being but at least you can read my stuff and look at my food porn! That's important, right? [Hears clock ticking] I guess.I'm dying from exhaustion hence my erratic, haphazard writing of this post. (Perhaps, it is my norm?) I just want to tell you all that the bugs with moving from Wordpress.com to my webhost, Bluehost, installing Wordpress.org's software and moving all of my blog's posts here is finally done! The frustration and sleepless night is over! I just have to make it pretty and organized for your aesthetic viewing. I hope that will be done by tomorrow or Thursday, the latest. Then I'll take care of updating my belated posts.Soo...for those of you who are smart enough to keep a RSS feed on my Flickr photostream (or just bookmark it), you are almost up to date about my whereabouts as to what I ate.I have a question to you all, can anyone suggest a good ad site? Or if there's any ad agency have and willing to sponsor my blog? (Food-related ads, of course.) If so, please e-mail me. This hosting thing isn't exactly cheap...

***CONTENT
[Note: I'm holding off writing posts that are non-Restaurant Week for the time being unless I do manage to squeeze in something between visits before this event is over. For those of you who are interested in RW, you have about another week to eat out.]Dovetail was on my list of restaurants that I thought of eating one day. Not the MUST EAT list but something to try once. What sparked my interest was Frank Bruni's review but reading a few different food forums, like Chowhound and e-Gullet over the past recent months, the foodie/gourmand community to appears to have a lukewarm or mixed response; also a friend of mine who went there a few months ago told me of a disappointing experience. I was ambivalent but I thought, \"What the heck, it's Restaurant Week. It's not like I'm going to try their tasting menu and spend an absurd amount of money.\" And took the available reservation the past Thursday afternoon.InteriorChecking in with the host, I was escorted to the small dining room, completely filled with diners, ranging from their 20s to a two parties of septuagenarians. Tables were relatively close to each other. The noise level was moderately loud with lively conversations and the occasional moments when I heard lively jazz being played in the background. As I was seated toward the back along the banquette, I was given the menu.Dovetail's menu and a funny line...This particular line you see above, \"Dovetail Loves Restaurant Week,\" was humorous to me. I don't think restaurants in general, loves Restaurant Week but I guess it's better than little or no business when it's the downtime of the tourist season as well as the economic slump that we're all in.CornbreadThe white cheddar cornbread was served warm. It's soft, crumbly with a touch of gritty cornmeal, tasted sweet and salty. The drawback was that it's too greasy for me, since there was a large grease stain left behind on the paper lining on the dish.AmuseAn amuse was served with the cornbread, a shot glass of sweet potato royale with melted rosemary marshmallow and fennel. First of all, I never encountered a restaurant during Restaurant Week serving amuses. I guess they do take RW with some gravity. This amuse was interesting when both parts were eaten in one bite - it was light and airy, tasted salty and cheesy yet sweet with a nuance of pungent rosemary. The fennel added a background of anise flavor and added a slight crunch. I liked this amuse but the gritty texture from the royale and the burnt marshmallow was a slight turnoff.Close up of the pork bellyThe pork belly with coco beans, Oloroso sherry and mustard-cranberry relish appetizer tasted as good as it looked. Crisp, fried exterior meets soft, creamy pork belly meat (or fat). The creamy, earthy beans played along with the pork's texture and the tart cranberries that just pop in my mouth. Oh. My. Goodness. I liked this dish a lot.Close up of the braised lamb shoulderThe braised Lamb Shoulder with carrots, almonds, blood oranges and yogurt entrée was quite interesting as well. Tender chunks of braised lamb sitting on a swath of tart, creamy yogurt foiled nicely with the crunchy almonds, lettuce, and sweet carrot slices.Top view of the caramel cakeAs for dessert, the caramel cake with popcorn ice cream and peanut butter powder didn't fared as well as I thought of. My waiter described this dessert as a yellow sponge cake that's soaked in caramel, served with popcorn ice cream and caramel popcorn. It is as what it's stated. The caramel could have been more complex or have some kind of rich, creamy fleur de sel caramel on top of the cake. The popcorn ice cream tasted more like a sherbert than an ice cream. I didn't like it nor love this dessert.Generally speaking, Dovetail has surprised me. Given the somewhat low expectations from them after reading so much about them. I would visit again. If I felt a bit disappointed from the dessert and have a need for something cold and creamy, I could go around the corner as the new Shake Shack is located and grab a small custard to go.Address: Dovetail 103 W 77th St (between Columbus Ave & Amsterdam Ave) New York, NY 10024 (map)

I made plans with Giulia several weeks ago to have lunch during Restaurant Week. I'm itching to try out new restaurants rather than my safe and dependable restaurants during this time of the year (e.g. Gramercy Tavern and Eleven Madison Park), so I proposed Matsugen. I heard generally good to very good reviews around the web so I thought this place wouldn't let me down.Matsugen's Exterior and InteriorArriving around 12:30, I waited in their lounge section of the restaurant while Giulia was driving into the city. The decor is understated, refined yet trendy enough for the hip neighborhood of TriBeca. Upbeat music playing softly in the background, a bit unexpected for an Asian themed restaurant but it's fine by me.Table SettingAs the hostess escorted to our table I've noticed, strangely, that the dining area is partitioned into three small sections rather than one relatively large dining space. Perhaps it's meant to feel more intimate?Anyway, when Giulia and I were perusing the menu, I was hoping that they would actually serve their \"Winter Promotion\" lunch bento box menu that's currently online, which reads the following: Green Salad with Soy Sauce, Homemade Soft Tofu, Goma-dare Soba, and Black Cod Miso for $24. However, the actual Restaurant Week prix fixe (I forgot to take a photo; a rare thing but it did happen) of $24 read: Green Salad, Mushroom broth with soba, Grilled Fish (which turned out to be salmon, observing from neighboring tables), and vanilla pudding. If you asked me, it sounded very depressing that I even asked the waitress if I could substitute the entree?Since this was obviously rejected, I worked around Giulia's budget and gauged how hungry we were (which was not very) and here's what I came up with picking from their a la carte menu:BakudanWe started with the Bakudan, a bowl filled with an assortment of raw or barely cooked seafood (scallops, calamari tentacles, salmon roe, uni, and shrimp) and natto beans with a side of nori sheets. What stood out from most of the appetizers that were on the a la carte menu were the natto beans and uni. I love uni's silky texture and how it tastes like the briny sea. As for natto, I never had it before. When I tried, it tasted a tad salty like soy sauce (it is fermented soybean, ya know?) but then the flavor changed to coffee. It was weird yet I liked it a lot. Texturally speaking, it's still soft and creamy like any typical bean one would eat. Mixing the barely poached egg yolk with all of the ingredients and eating it with the nori, this was interesting to eat. The nori gives it the salty, briny flavor with some crispness, the bakudan mixture is chewy, silky and the natto's coffee flavor that lingers on the palate.Black Cod with MisoProgressing onto the mains, I've ordered black cod with miso and cold soba with Kamoseiro duck soup. The black cod was simply amazing. It's perfectly cooked, moist, and the fish is fluffy. The sauce that's coated the cod was sweet and salty. I wouldn't have mind eating several orders of this dish.Cold soba with Kamoseiro duck soup and the cool red kettleThe cold soba with Kamoseiro duck soup was a pretty generous portion of cold soba noodles that's served with a small bowl of salty, flavorful duck broth. This particular dish is comfort food for me in the winter - a hot bowl of soup and noodles, hence the reason why I ordered it. The plus was, there's four slices of meaty, tender (with a touch of fat) duck in there absorbing salty flavors in the warm soup. How we're supposed to eat it, as the server told us, we take the soba noodles and drop it in the hot bowl of soup to be warmed and eat it. The cool, red kettle was given to us when we're almost done (see pictured above); it's meant to dilute the salty broth and it warms it up so we can drink it.This was very good and Giulia and I were satiated by the time we're done with our meal. I didn't bother with dessert since I'm running late and she has to go to another engagement.Would I go to Matsugen in the near future? Yes, but wouldn't bother with their Restaurant Week menu. I do hope they'll switch back to the aforementioned \"Winter Promotion\" menu soon since I heard really good things about their soft tofu (and I do love my tofu) and the goma-dare soba, then I'll think about coming back.Address: Matsugen 241 Church Street (off of Leonard Street) New York, NY 10013 (map)

Disagree with respect to Restaurant Week menu for Dinner. I went last night and it was full of variety and perfectly portioned. First course was Miso soup with soft tofu followed by amazingly marinated hamachi, mid was an assortment of small plates including crispy shrimp and sushi, and finally a choice between the soba you had and a mushroom broth soba. We added the braised pork belly.All together, it was a very well designed menu with a good amount of variety. I definitely want to return to try the off-set menu items.

joannova: Thanks.Danny: Yeah, it was a bummer.Rahul: Thanks as well.Raf: I'm just telling you and all of my readers how I experienced lunch. I didn't say it was for both Restaurant Week lunch and dinner.If Matsugen kept the Winter Promotion lunch menu, I would have been happy but I tried replicating (within my friend's budget and splitting the meal; the only thing that was from the original menu was the black cod miso) for this lunch and it worked out. Thankfully, we aren't starved women before we would've bought something after eating here.

Natto - OMG! I eat a lot of weird things like swallow's saliva and intestines but even I can't like natto. It looks like melted aliens to me and smells like an incubated stinky sock (I also love the chinese stinkie tofu.) So kudos to you.I am going to try the soba with duck soup broth, sounds more flavorful than the ususal soba broths.

amedemonet: I how can you NOT like natto?! I've eaten swallow's saliva (tastes good) but not intestines yet... Thankfully my parents didn't make me eat the latter when I was a kid.The duck soup is one of the safer things we've (as in Giulia and I) eaten for this particular meal.

Jessica: I'm not much of a pudding person. I mean, I do like pudding but not obsessed about it (like macarons). If Matsugen did have their grapefruit jelly as part of the prix fixe, then I would start moping about it.

Stuffed Cheeseburgers at Stumble Inn

The past Friday, I've finally eaten out with Mary and her friend and fellow co-worker, Mei. How Mary and I know each other was actually through Robyn. Small world, no?We've been discussing for nearly several weeks about getting together for lunch and despite the fact that it's recruitment season (Mary being snowed in with a TON of work by her bosses), she promulgated that Friday would be our lunch date, whether her bosses like it or not. Hey, I don't mind. I don't have anything urgent to take care of on my end. After exchanging several emails with Mary and Mei, we finally decided upon having our faces stuffed with stuffed cheeseburgers from Stumble Inn, after I was inspired after reading A Hamburger Today's post about this place.Menu cover & InteriorTrekking up from our offices in the cold (not bitter cold, like today's high of 19 degrees Fahrenheit), we finally made it. In this quiet, sort of cozy neighborhood bar it was speckled with a man lingering at the bar and a pair of men sitting at one of the tables. The sole waitress told us that we could sit wherever we like and sat at a table near the windows, peering out the sidewalk facing East 76th Street.We pretty much knew what we wanted to eat and didn't really try too hard deciding upon which Juicy Lucy we wanted.Mei's burger and ketchup actionMei ordered The Second Avenue Stumbler; a burger that encased swiss cheese and sauteed mushrooms with a side of tater tots. Unfortunately, I don't have an innards shot but when she ate her burger, a lot of juice leaked out - most likely it's the water from the sauteed mushrooms. She told me it was good. I did try her tater tot and it tasted like the frozen variety and it's on the greasy side.Mary's burger and friesMary customized her burger with American cheese and sauteed onions and a side of fries. But made my eyes open wide was the moment after Mary took a bite of her burger. Just take a look below...Gloriously cheeesyDon't you understand now? It ooozed a ton of melted, gooey cheese! My brain pretty much had the emotions of this emoticon: @.@. I haven't tasted it either since I have a burger before me as well.American BurgerMy American Burger was stuffed with American cheese and crispy bacon and like Mary, with a side of fries. The burger is cooked too well for my preference (I like medium rare burgers) but I know their intention is to heat and melt the cheese within the burger. The bacon flavor wasn't strong enough for me even though there were bacon bits in every bite. Methinks there's too much cheese in ratio to bacon. As for the bun, it's the generic, soft hamburger bun that I prefer. It doesn't require much chewing and it doesn't screw up the texture of the meat and filling. The fries tasted like the typical frozen fries, nothing to write home about.Hmm...not as coma inducing as I thoughtIt was a fun hanging out and having lunch with Mary and Mei. This excursion just made us a tad aware of some possible food spots in this bleak area of Manhattan, especially burgers.Address: The Stumble Inn 1454 2nd Avenue New York, NY 10021 (map)

Melissa: Thanks! Melted cheese is a very seductive thing. :)Danny: If they actually do manage to cook it medium-rare, all is BLISS!!DocChuck: Thank you so much! :D Personally, I think other burgers in NYC fare better than Stumble Inn's but the obvious difference is the fact they're stuffed.

My photo is featured in Forbes' Magazine's favorite restaurant picks. [Points down]FOR REALZ?!I almost forgotten about this and thought it wouldn't happen since I'm just a wee food-and-photo obsessed blogger. I mean, I'm sure that there are a lot of professional photographers out there who could easily take an exponentially better photo than I could and somehow I've been \"discovered.\"How this happened was that the photo editor of Forbes contacted me and requested to use my photo of Cafe Boulud (this one) about a month ago. Since I haven't heard anything more beyond the first few days, I presumed they're not using my photo. However, the same person emailed me yesterday and told me that I was featured and gave me the link.All I could say is, \"Wow...I feel humbled.\" I just wish they do linkbacks but obviously it's hard to do for a caption but it's better than no credit (Duh!).If you would like to see the actual page, here is the link. Just be warned that their slideshow starts automatically within a few seconds.Thanks to Forbes for featuring me and to all of you guys for (silently) rooting for me.

This was taken place before the New Year's, December 29th. Yeah, I'm behind.InteriorIt's been a year hiatus since I've been to Jean Georges and I thought it's about time to eat there again before New Year's dawns upon us.MenuPerusing through the menu, it didn't change much with the exception of tweaking some ingredients or flavorings to make it more \"seasonal\" or adding in some new dishes like Nishiki risotto, Parmesan, yuzu, Thai chili and Japanese red snapper carpaccio, crystallized ginger, white radish and olive oil. Eventually, I chose to go with the two-course, two-dessert route.Amuse BoucheAs always, in Jean Georges at least, the amuse bouche was given. It's similar to what I had [cref lunch-with-two-exec-chefs-at-jean-georges last time]. The difference between then and now is, swapping out the shiitake mushroom for a dehydrated tangerine with a citrus-flavored gelee. This particular part of the amuse wasn't appealing to me. It was very dry (flavor-speaking) and a bit too tart (that I coughed out loud to this moderately quiet dining room) and it's one-note flavor: citrus. The other amuses were a shot of artichoke soup with hibiscus foam and a slice of salmon belly with scallion sauce. Of the two, I liked the soup more. It's earthy yet the foam lightened the rich texture and added some floral notes.Roasted Brussels SproutsMoving on to the first course, I had roasted brussels sprouts, avocados and pistachios, mustard vinaigrette. I love the roasted brussels sprouts because of the sweetness that comes out when it's caramelized and the bitter undertones that is usually associated with this vegetable. The pistachios added a kind of creamy, nutty element as well as the avocado slices, found underneath the pungent arugula leaves. It was good, not exactly earth shattering though.SweetbreadsAs you might know by now, if you've been reading this blog for a while, I love offals, especially sweetbreads. I order them whenever it's on a menu. Anyway, these pan roasted sweetbreads, licorice, grilled pear and lemon did not disappoint. The sweetbreads were creamy and delicious, while the licorice root were skewered into the sweetbreads. I hate licorice candy (tastes medicinal and bitter) but this wasn't aggressive, thankfully. It just adds a mellow spice and sweetness to the offal. The slice of grilled pear enhanced the sweet factor and the lemon's acidity brightens the earthy dish. I wished I had more but I needed to save room for...TWO desserts!Two desserts! Yes, I was crazy (arguably bold) enough to think that I could finish two desserts on my own.\"Winter\" Dessert TastingStarting with the seasonal dessert theme, Winter, a plating of cranberry parfait, walnut nougatine, soft meringue and a cinnamon doughnut and prune-Armagnac jam, they were both very good. I liked the texture of the cranberry parfait - cold, smooth and creamy from the parfait and the slightly warm, marshmallow-like pillow of meringue contrasting a whisper of crunchiness from the walnut nougatine base - but I would prefer the cranberry flavor to be more robust.The cinnamon doughnut combination with the jam was delicious (light and airy, not greasy doughnut meets creamy, sweet with a touch of alcohol jam) but I wanted a bigger doughnut to schmear on the rest of the jam. The menu should have mentioned doughnut hole, even though I know I was expecting it to be on the tasting portion side. Hey, I like doughnuts! Don't deprive me of wanting more if it's good.Innards of the cranberry parfaitCaramel curd, dehydrated sponge dessertMoving onto the other dessert theme, Caramel, this was generally disappointing. The portion of caramel curd, dehydrated sponge, roasted pineapple sorbet flavors and textures were discordant. You have the cold, sharp, sweet pineapple sorbet with the almost-chewy caramel curd that doesn't taste caramel-ly enough and the dehydrated sponge just added a crunchy texture, not much in terms of flavor. It's weird and left me scratching my head wondering if I missed something.Chocolate Pop and a bitten shotThe saving grace of this tasting was the chocolate pop, coffee-cardamom ice cream. Smooth, creamy ice cream that's boldly flavored with coffee with a hint of warm, sweet-spicy flavor of the cardamom encapsulated by crisp tempered dark chocolate. This was awesome. I wouldn't have mind if Pastry Chef Johnny Iuzzini just serve me a normal sized ice cream bar of this.MignardesAnd as every Jean Georges lunch (I don't know about dinner since I can't afford it yet) ends, mignardes was served. Nothing changed here - the usual puffy macarons (that aren't remotely divine as Pierre Herme), bonbons to nibble on, and the trio of house-made marshmallows. Nothing much to note about but it's a nice way to end the meal and a bittersweet ending to 2008.Address:Jean Georges 1 Central Park West (between W 60th & W 61st Street; inside the Trump Tower) New York, NY‎ 10023 (map)

Yeah, something about \"dehydrated sponge\" does not seem like a dessert to be optimistic about! Even though some of the dishes you had weren't amazing, I'm still envious of your meal. Especially the soup amuse bouche, though I don't really know what hibiscus tastes like.

Let's just say that they ran out of salt in the kitchen, because they decided to dump all of what they had on MY plate. Blech!

Dollar for dollar best lunch in Manhattan, you should try to go more often. I have been most weeks over the past 10 years.

VeggieGirl: Ah, I see. Sorry that you had to face that situation.catherine: Even though JG is pricey for the not-so-wealthy (e.g. a poor college/graduate student), this particular lunch venture is worth it in terms of the superb quality of the ingredients.Randy: I went there pretty often back in 2008 but I don't feel compelled to go there once a week since they don't change their menu often.

Cheers!Happy belated new year everyone! I hope all of you had a great time partying all night long or had a quiet time at home with friends and family. If you're wondering what the heck I did, I went with the latter option. I'm not exactly the nightlife-lovin' gal. I just shared a bottle of Prosecco with my family at midnight and made this cake several hours before. [Points down]Crepe cakeYup, I made a gâteau de crêpes cake with green tea pastry cream. (For a not-so-fancy name would be a crêpe cake). All thanks to Seungmi for giving me the book, Chocolate Epiphany for Christmas. Looking through the entire book made me drool and yet it motivated me to create a time consuming cake. It's just a lot of waiting - resting the batter for at least two hours in the refrigerator and cooling the pastry cream, then making A LOT of crêpes for the darn cake.Serving and my slice of cakeAs you might notice, the green tea isn't so green. I didn't use any matcha green tea powder. I replaced it with my aunt's Bi Luo Chun tea because I don't want to spend $10 for a tin of tea that I'm not intending to drink and the tea that I've replaced with was quite intense, bitter and floral that I could use it. Problem was, I didn't use enough of the tea despite dumping a large amount when I infused it with the milk. [sighs] The other drawback was the fact that I spread the pastry cream too thinly that the cream was almost been totally absorbed by the crêpes. Bah. It's a learning process and I'm willing to re-do this cake in the near future. It tasted good but of course, there's always room for improvement on my end.As for my baking lovin' readers, I would type out the recipe but I'm too lazy to do so. It doesn't help that the book is at home, too. Double d'oh! If you want me to send you the recipe, just email me. I think Francois Payard would have issues with me if I posted it on my blog.

[I hope I'll write a \"normal\" (helps if it's somewhat current, too) review soon. It's just the fact that my mom's going to have surgery this coming week, life's a bit insane for the time being. Probably, I'll end up doing an intense session of posting up this weekend. Apologies to you all!]Some dim sum food pornA while back on January 31st, I had dim sum with Robyn, Lee Anne, Erin (of Serious Eats), Mitzy and her husband, Ferry, at Jade Asian Restaurant in Flushing. As you see above, I just plastered a bit of food photos for you but I'm not going to write a full post on it because I'm waay behind. But succinctly review about their dim sum, it's very good and fresh but it's arguably on the pricier end of the spectrum (we ordered about 20 plates or so of food and it came out to be $23 per person, including tax and tip).If you want to read some input from Robyn on SE, here's the link.Another thing, if you do have a Twitter account and sort of read my random ramblings about what I'm eating, ate or whatever and find out how crazy or boring I may be, I'm at: twanderingeater.Address:Jade Asian Restaurant 136-28 39th Avenue Flushing, NY 11354 (map)

[Continuing on from the evening portion with Patrick. If you haven't read the first part, please do so (click here). I know I'm doing this at a painfully slow pace but uh, stuff is happening in life that's slowing me down from updating. Sorry.]If any of you ever meet Patrick in person, he tells you two things. No. Make it three: (1) he's vegetarian but loooves cheese, (2) he needs to eat a lot (like a minimum of 4,000 calories) before he withers away (lucky him), and (3) he loves tea. I covered fact number one at Hearth, fact number two is supplemented with my food gifts to him (Mitzy's macarons from Tafu, Bouchon Bakery's peanut butter cup, and Momofuku Milk Bar's cookies) and whatever he ate earlier in the day, and now I'm taking care of number 3. Since that evening was really cold and ridiculously windy, we seek refuge to the nearest tea house from Hearth the my mind can come up with - Cha'an.Interior and Tea MapsGoing up a flight of narrow stairs from the entrance, it felt like we were transported to a different place. It's zen-like yet casual and lots of conversations carried around in this small tea house. You can tell it's very tea-focused when you flip through the pages of the menu. Especially with the worn pages of the world map indicating what region the tea comes from.Eventually, Patrick and I settled with Twelve Tea Oolong - tea for two, gungfu style. Both of us were scratching our heads wondering what does \"gungfu style\" mean? But we just let our waitress enlighten us and show the proper technique when she brought us the tea set and cookies to go with it. (But if you're inclined to know the whole story, look at this Wikipedia article.)Gung-fu tea ceremonyAfter the few minutes of demonstration and the actual serving of the oolong tea, Patrick and I were amused how it went and chatted on the highlights of this entire ceremony. Tasting a sip from my dainty tea cup, this oolong tea was very delicious. It's fragrant with a hint of floral musk and I like the bitter to sweet flavors of the tea. This was enjoyed immensely.Shortbread cookiesThe plate of shortbread cookies were pretty good. All were crumbly, buttery and not too sweet. The two flavors offered were green tea and black sesame. The one that tasted better was the black sesame because of its inherent nutty flavor when it's toasted.Mochi & InnardsBack when Patrick and I were discussing online, prior to his visit to NYC, I've asked him if he ever tried the lovely Japanese confection, mochi? He replied to me that he hasn't, I've urged that we shared a plate of Earl Grey Tea-Chocolate mochi. What I love about mochi (in case you never tried it), is it's soft, chewy rice cake exterior and the subtly sweet filling (usually the red adzuki bean paste) meshes so well together. Getting to the point, Cha'an's version is about as addictive as Minamoto Kitchoan's chocolate daifuku. The difference between the two, Cha'an's rice cake exterior is softer, almost pillow-like, obviously, there's no cocoa powder rolled on it, and the chocolate filling does have a hint of Earl Grey tea flavor.After eating the mochi, we've lingered around - drinking more tea, chatting and catching up.Address:Cha'an 230 E 9th Street, 2nd Floor (between 2nd Avenue & Stuyvesant Street) New York, NY 10003 (map)

Walked by that place many times and it always looks swanky. I guess my brain associates Japanese teahouse with swank... so the idea of high prices have always kept me away. Is it an everyday kind of place or a once in a while kind of place?
thewanderingeater
2009-02-20 14:52:00
Danny: I guess I can understand your thought that Japanese = swank = $$$$ but it's not terribly expensive. In terms of prices, it can be an everyday thing like a pot of tea with multiple savory food bites (possibly a full course?) would go for $16. I haven't ventured a lot to this place but after this experience, I do want to go back.

[I know I'm supposed to write about the tea outing with Patrick but I need to do this first. I promise things would go back to normal.]I used to think Grand Central Terminal's Market has nothing fit for me, in regards to food. It's just a transfer hub to get to work with the occasional need of caffeine from my beloved Joe that opened ever since the past fall. Arguably, it's the best thing that happened to this station for me. I depend on my life for good coffee. But I needed more than just coffee and willing to open my mind a bit when I was invited by Susan to try a few things from this vast area.Murray's Real Salami; Lots of meeaatt...The past Friday afternoon, I've met Susan to a tasting at Murray's Real Salami. We got acquainted and eventually met our charcuterie guide, Aaron.Yep, I ate it all...and a bit moreAaron gave us a whirlwind of a meat tour and almost tried one of everything in their display case (as you see the photos above; just click on it to know what is what). There are a some missing photos since it's almost back-to-back samplings of meat (the Prosciutto de Parma and the coarsely ground, duck rillettes - which is similar to pâté, if you ever ate it).My favorites were the acorn fed piggy, the Iberco bellota. It's so nutty, silky but admittedly a tad chewy. The lardo that made me craved for a fresh, crusty baguette to nosh on, and a rich (reads: 75/25 pork-to-fat ratio), complex, wine-y, rich Felino salami. The others were great but it didn't knock my socks off as the ones I've just mentioned.All of their meats are sliced tissue paper thin by machine. I know some of you salume snobs would prefer to have some of your meats cut by hand but at least it's consistent here and I'm content with it.Some seafood from PescatoreAfter eating (and arguably, hardening my arteries) Susan took me over to Pescatore and we've met with the outgoing, hospitable co-owner, Glenn. Pescatore started as a wholesale seafood company that gotten a retail outlet here in Grand Central Market and expanded with their prepared seafood. His brother Jerry, who was a CIA alum created recipes for the prepared foods. It's a logical and a good business idea to do so since they have great ingredients, utilize it and charge in accordance to the quality of the food.Since my time was running out (I had to go back to work), Glenn was gracious enough to let me bring back several items to sample - a slab of sesame crusted yellowfin tuna that cuts like butter and melts in my mouth like it, coconut crusted shrimp, grilled shrimp, and their famed Maryland lump crab cake, that stole the show. The crab cake was packed with sweet, lump crab meat that's barely crusted with panko bread crumbs. They're all very delicious and I highly recommend you to try some of their seafood. (Note: Yes, I forgot to take photos of the samplers. I was starving and my camera was not in the same vicinity as my food. Apologies again.)Address:Murray's Real Salami & Pescatore In Grand Central Market 87 E 42nd Street (between Park Ave & Vanderbilt Ave) New York, NY 10017 (map)

A Great Dinner at Hearth

This dinner dates back on January 16, 2009. Yes, it's a bit dated but it's still valid when you look at their current menu.About a month or so, in December, Patrick (if you look back at the Alta post, that's when I knew him) and I chatted online like we usually do on a workday. The surprising thing he told me was he's coming to visit New York City for the weekend. I was happy since I haven't seen him for nearly a year or so and he wanted to eat dinner. Somewhere. I scratched my head a bit and tried to think of vegetarian-friendly places that would appeal to him and my meat-liking self. Of the bunch of places I've thought up of, we settled on Hearth for its delicious sounding menu. I also wanted the highly touted cider donuts. In case you don't know this by now, I love desserts.Interior & MenuHearth's interior looked very handsome and welcoming. Brick walls with warm, wooden-beamed ceilings. The wall beside us (not pictured) were lined with large squares of felt or velvet. Also, if you looked toward the part of the room where it's facing Second Avenue, there's a large cauldron hung up on the wall.When we're seated and given menus, Patrick and I didn't bother staring and contemplating much as to what we should order - we've made our decisions practically a week ahead. All we did was chat and catch up a bit until the waiter came back and inquired what we would like to have.AmuseThe amuse of the evening was parsnip soup served in a shot glass. It's simple, unpretentious in presentation but very flavorful and creamy. We liked it a lot. Patrick was a bit shocked that he liked this soup because he normally doesn't care much for parnsips.Hen of the WoodsAs for our appetizers, Patrick and I ordered from their side dishes portion of the menu. He ordered the hen of the woods. Trying a mushroom, this was great. Tender, flavorful with a touch of buttery silkiness.Bite-sized cloudsAs for me, I had the gnocchi. I italicized gnocchi because it's another one of those dishes that I've heard that one must get at Hearth. Was it worth the hype? Simply stated, yeeess. These little bite-sized clouds speckled with parmesan cheese and pepper, lightly coated with butter sauce were awesome. I had to pause a moment every time I took a forkful of these delicate yet rich babies.Pumpkin TortelliMoving onto our entrees, Patrick ordered the pumpkin tortelli. Never having the combination of pumpkin and pasta before, he's blown away. Al dente pasta stuffed with pumpkin-y filling with hints of sage, amaretti, and chestnuts. Everything was balanced in terms of sweet and savory flavors.Braised Veal BreastMe being the carnivore that I am, I ordered the braised veal breast. The chilly weather is making me crave something stewed or braised. Anyway, this tender, rolled up breast meat was juicy and flavorful. My favorite part was the nugget of creamy sweetbreads. Man, I wanted more. The cauliflower balanced out the meatiness of the dish and it played on the sweetness of the meat and added a subtle crunch.Apple Cider DonutsAs we progressed onto dessert, Patrick and I split the apple cider donuts with apple compote and maple whipped cream - Hearth's signature dessert. And indeed, it should be. Just taking a bite of the warm donut (complete with an über thin crust and soft, pillowy crumb) with a smear of gently sweetened apple compote and whipped cream my mind went to \"OMG...! to [brain went flat-line]\" It was a roller coaster ride of euphoria. Words cannot express how awesome this dessert is. You just have to try it.Sorbet SamplerRecovering after the first few bites of the aforementioned donuts, we remembered the colorful yet seasonal sorbet sampler were near us. The three scoops consisted of cranberry, quince, and spiced pear served with two delicately buttery tuile cookies. The most poignant thing I remembered from the three sorbets, besides it being almost sherbet in texture, was the spiced pear scoop. It tasted like Patrick's jarred pears he sent me for my belated birthday present - intense pear flavor with a kick of cinnamon. It surprised both of us when we thought about it.Molasses cookies with the checkAs we're satiated from dessert, we asked for the check. The nice touch was the small serving of crisp molasses cookies. After the check's been paid, Patrick wanted to have tea, which I'll cover in the next post...Address:Hearth 403 E 12th Street (off of 1st Avenue) New York, NY 10009 (map)

My good friend, Mitzy Budiono, the woman behind Itzy Bitzy Patisserie, has given me a batch of February's featured French-style macarons flavors to sample this past weekend. Yes, she's the one who I would deem as the Pierre Hermé on this side of the Atlantic or at least New York City.February's flavorsAs the container is labeled, this month's rotation (of six flavors) consists of coffee, chocolate hazelnut, mango, Earl grey, strawberry chocolate (chocolate ganache with strawberry gelée bits within the filling), and Champagne (dark chocolate ganache with concentrated Champagne flavor sans the effervescence).Stacks of macaronsThey all are divine and made me a very happy girl. The cookies had that thin, crisp crust with a moist, flavorful crumb. The fillings were flavorful and not too sweet. Those of you who know how I much love Mitzy's macarons and you live within the NYC area, by all means get your butt to Tafu now and get some macarons! NOW! (Tafu is the only retailer at the moment that carries Itzy Bitzy Patisserie's macarons.)Address:Tafu 569 Lexington Avenue (on 51st Street) New York, NY 10022 (map)

You're back up!Man, these macarons will not last long at Tafu...Oh, quick note about the layout... It's looking good! When you post a picture as wide as the one with the macarons in this post, it looks funny if my browser is not maximized... since the flickr badge gets pushed onto the picture. Not sure if this makes any sense or if it's just my computer...

dbtron: A little bit of chew, not a lot. If it's really chewy, that ain't a good macaron in my book...Danny: YES! Woot! Thanks for the compliment. It's not just your computer. It's everyone's. The Flickr photo posted on the post is fixed unlike the layout itself that is fluid, so by all means try to keep your browser opened to it's maximum amount.I know these babies [the macarons] are wildly popular because of Serious Eats and a small bit from me.

Amazing Pizza at Co. (or Company)

Waaay back on Friday, January 9th, I've invited a whole bunch of friends: Robyn, Kathy, Doug, Helen, Kim, Julie, and Giulia for dinner at Co.Most of us who are familiar with Jim Lahey's Sullivan Street Bakery are fans of his bread and wouldn't pass up the chance of trying out his wonderful pizza. Hell, the biggest temptation was Adam Kuban's multiple posts about Co. made us all weak in the knees and tortured us with the glorious food photos when he previewed and ate during the soft opening run.Co's exterior and interiorExpecting a somewhat of a long wait, knowing that this place is on the small side and I'm in a group of 8 hungry stomachs, I went with Helen early straight after work to get myself on the wait list. The bad part was waiting for nearly 1 1/2 hours, hearing my friends' complaints that they're dying of starvation but we got a table before the second wave of people crowding near the entrance and bar area. I think the host felt awful that I had to wait for so long and sat us on the round table that's on the corner of the restaurant, closest to the windows. (For Robyn's sake, she's lucky enough that she works a few blocks away from Co., that I texted her to come over NOW! As for Kathy, she had to come down from her Midtown East office to get her skinny self here.)When we sat down and looked at the menu for a minute or two, we lost patience and ordered two pizzas without Robyn and Kathy.The FlambéeThe <bflambée pizza made of bechamel, parmesan, buffalo mozzarella, caramelized onions and lardons were stuff that dreams were made of. Some people have indicated on the Web that it's heavy but we loved everything about it. The creamy, seductive bechamel sauce meshed with the beautifully, melted mozzarella cheese, the salty hit from the parmesan cheese, and the sweet caramelized onions. OMG. We loved this pizza and we all agreed that we would eat a huge bucket of their bechamel sauce. (Side note, Robyn made it on time for the last piece of this pizza.)Ham & Cheese PizzaThe ham and cheese pizza topped with pecorino, gruyere, buffalo mozzarella cheeses with prosciutto and caraway was very good as well. It's not as impressive as the flambée but we liked it a lot. (Kathy made it for this pizza - about 20 minutes later when we started.)Bosciaola pizzaMoving onto the bosciaola pizza, made of tomato, mushroom, buffalo mozzarella, pork sausage, onion, and chili peppers was appealing because of its spiciness. For me, it warmed my palate as I kept munching on my piece probably from the combination of onions and chilies. Helen found this pizza too spicy for her tastebuds that she passed her portion to Doug.Another roundFor Kathy's peace of mind, we ordered another round of flambée pizza. We didn't mind since we loved this one a lot and we still have room for more pizza.And to have some form of roughage for dinner, we ordered the Popeye pizza. Personally, I don't want greens on my pizza but this isn't bad. I think what made me liked it was the gentle hit of garlic and the yeasty flavor of the crust.A pile of cookiesBy the time we're satiated, I asked for the check and along with it, came with a small plate of almond-anise biscotti. These small, crunchy cookies were pretty good. The subtle flavor of anise made it a bit interesting.Overall, I love all of their pizzas. The crust sometimes is a bit too burnt or have huge gas bubbles baked into the crust but it's not that bad. Some particular pizzas were very good to some that I could care less of. And I didn't try out their toasts, salads or anything that's not their primary focus - pizza. (Why would anyone try to eat anything beyond a certain food establishment's forte?) I would love to go there again. Hopefully soon.Address: Co. (fyi, it's known as \"Company\") 230 9th Avenue (at W 24th Street) New York, NY 10001 (map)

Wow, only five pizzas for eight people? I could eat a whole one by myself. I think when we went, we got 8-9 pizzas for five people. The crust is pretty thing and the pies aren't very filling. Was the special truffle pizza on the menu when you went? Did you try any of the other appetizers?
thewanderingeater
2009-02-02 10:00:00
Kathryn: Yes, we ordered five without any appetizers, salads, or antipasti. Strangely enough, we're pretty satisfied. Methinks after all that waiting, our hunger subsided? (Also a few of the girls who were there don't eat a lot in one sitting.) We did walk down a few blocks for Robyn's sake of her craving for an diner-style ice cream sundae from Chelsea Square Restaurant.As for the truffle pizza, yes, it existed but we didn't bother ordering because it might blow some of our budgets. But if you're curious, here's the menu shot:

As my title says, I'm going on a vacation! Not now, but I will be in late April to early May to Hong Kong and the southern part of China! WOOT! I'm finally leaving this continent. It's been over half my life since I've been there. Reasons why I'm flying my butt half way across the world is because my cousin's getting married and my aunt urges me for years to come over to visit her and my mom's side of the family. Feeling much to the point of getting burnt from taking care of my mom and working, I'm taking a much needed vacation!Soo... More to the reason why I'm posting this announcement is, I'm asking the HK expats, residents, and recent visitiors, what is good to eat there?! I know I'm going to visit Macau for Kee Wah pastries. My aunt always brings a bunch of their awesome pastries whenever she visits NYC and it haunts my dreams. (I know they have a Los Angeles branch but I want to go to the original establishment.) I know there's kick ass dim sum there. But any other suggestions? Please comment below. Thanks!

It's been a while since I was in Hong Kong, but I remember having this delicious black sesame bubble tea. I can't remember the name, but it's a tea house there that is synonymous with Starbucks... they're everywhere! My only regret was that I really had to pee and they didn't have a bathroom (how ironic!) and I didn't finish it. Oh! Down the street there was a three-evel Epsrit store. I hope that helps some!

check out my website for some of the restaurants i've been to in hong kong.  if there's one recommendation i would make, it's the bamboo noodle place in tai po cooked foods centre (the one anthony bourdain went to and documented in no reservations: hong kong)...it's the real deal.  i would also check out some of the tea time buffets at some of the nicer hotels here -- some of the best food is to be had in these kinds of places.  bon voyage and have a great trip.

For a nice breakfast at a charcoal grill pushcart, take the subway to Central Station, exit D2 and then follow the map here:http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&lr=lang_en&hl=en&msa=0&ll=22.282544,114.156028&spn=0.002571,0.004807&z=18&msid=114083618749640987024.00046643e832fa14bb9a9There is only one pushcart selling breakfast.  Open every day except Sunday.  Starts at 9:30amWe highly recommend the following:
 - Milk coffee
 - Instant noodles
 - Toast (comes with peanut butter, condensed milk and jamIn that same area there are other pushcarts that serve dinner.

Lunch at the Tavern in Gramercy Tavern

Taken place on March 5, 2009.Interior of the Tavern, left, and Exec Chef Michael AnthonyDuring the week when half of my lab is out to conference in the West Coast, I managed to relax a bit to have lunch at Gramercy Tavern. It also helps with timing, since I have to use their gift certificate that was given out during Restaurant Week in February. Not wanting to bother with spending a whole lot of money and time in the formal portion of the restaurant, I opted to dine at the tavern room.Oddly enough, I spotted Executive Chef Michael Anthony sitting with another person about for about half of my stay there. The Tavern is still busy as is usually is, with diners, mostly regulars and some visitors, walking past my table and the conversations around are lively. I'm just the odd ball being the solo, quiet diner wanting to be alone with my food and take pictures of it with my large camera.SweetbreadsAfter perusing their menu, I've decided upon ordering sweetbreads to start with. As any of you who have read this blog long enough, I love all things offal. Well, most of it. Gramercy Tavern's rendition of Sweetbreads with escarole, capers and lemon was pretty good. Creamy, tender sweetbreads with a peppery hint from the escarole. The drawback was the capers - a bit too salty and briny that it overpowers the sweetbreads flavor rather than enhancing it.Soup & SandwichProceeding onto the Four Story Hill Chicken Soup and Ricotta Dumplings and Salsify with their Housemade Pastrami Sandwich, I've swapped out the original pairing of the soup and sandwich - cauliflower soup - for the chicken soup. I was yearning for comfort food, albeit with an upscale twist. The soup was lovely. Hearty, filled with large cubes of tender chicken, lots of diced vegetables as I scoop up a spoon. The ricotta dumplings were very soft that it melts in my mouth.As for the pastrami sandwich, made with their own potato bread, toasted on the cut side (smart move), smeared with garlic mayonnaise, their own pastrami, and lined with arugula, and sweet pickled cippolini onions. Just one bite made my mind scream, \"OMG!\" The soft, slightly sweet potato bread with a touch of crunch from being toasted meets the salty, peppery pastrami and arugula and a touch of crunch from the pickled onions. It was a freakin' amazing sandwich. Not many sandwiches swoon me but this one had my heart.Chocolate PuddingDespite the fact that I was full, I still had my eyes (and stomach) set for dessert. I was indecisive between two different desserts but went for what my waiter liked a lot - the chocolate pudding (note that it's no longer on their dessert menu now, if you look at their site). I know all of you might be screaming at me ,\"Why did you order pudding?! You know how to bake, surely you could make your own pudding.\" Well, yes, I do know how to make chocolate pudding, bread pudding, etc. I'm curious to know how Pastry Chef Nancy Olsen would make chocolate pudding interesting.Has Ms. Olsen knocked my socks off? Not really. But I did love her creamy salted caramel that I wanted to order a bucket to go. The toasted, caramelized brioche croutons brought some texture that's needed from everything silky smooth.Want a bite?Address:Gramercy Tavern 42 East 20th St (between Park Ave S & Broadway) New York, NY 10003 (map)

Mitchel London, Fairway Café, and Huge Rib Eyes

HUGE rib eyesI was invited back on March 4th (yes, I know I'm really behind) to attend a dinner and food demonstration at Fairway Café with Mitchel London leading the show - well, co-starring since this class is called \"Mitchel & Me.\" The \"me\" is Dan Glickberg, the 4th generation owner of Fairway. (It's a family-run business, in case you didn't know.) I thought it was cool since I do like his most of his baked goods over at Mitchel London Foods.Mitchel whistlingWalking through the mosh-pit like crowds and lines in Fairway Market, I finally made it upstairs where it's relatively quieter and see Mr. London and others prepping for the show. As the attendees of this demo and dinner gathered up, I've noticed that Mitchel is pretty much calm as time ticks closer to starting time. As you see the photo above, he's whistling and I heard Mozart's Symphony No. 40. (It helps that I listen classical music often.)He's passing out the appsWhen it's about five minutes to the actual starting of the class, Mitchel passed out napkins and an appetizer - buttery, flaky puff pastries filled with a shrimp and herbed cream sauce. I don't recall what was the name but that's all I remembered eating and tasting. All I could think of while eating this thing was the word, \"decadent.\"Dan (the \"Me\" portion of this demo) and MitchelEventually, Mitchel and Dan officially introduced themselves and chatted up a bit about Fairway, Mitchel and shared anecdotes that they had in their past together and of recent.The menu for the evening consisted of rib eye steak for two (but what they've demonstrated, as you've seen from the first photo, could feed three or four), Caesar salad (done Mitchel's way), potatoes au gratin, and apple tatin. Here's three groups of photo splodges to give you a gist of what happened during the class. I know my descriptions won't help you much.Prepping and the final result of the apple tatinsExtra cream (literally) potatoes au gratinMammoth-sized rib eyes that I wanted to eatOnce Mitchel was done plating the rib eyes, it was time for dinner. Woot. My stomach was running on empty and I was very tempted to take the plate that's closest to me.It's dinner rushWhile everyone started to mingle at their own tables, the waiters started to collect the orders of each table, indicating how would one like to have their steak done. Since I don't have anything better to do (though I do have Helen in tow), I walked up and around to take a peek at kitchen - seeing Mitchel working on the Caesar salad, the cooks waiting for the orders, etc. It's pretty hectic yet very energetic in both the dining room and the kitchen.The wine that I haven't tasted :(When the wine guy started to talk about what's being served for the evening, he mentioned a rosé wine that should be accompanied with the salad. However, they ran out so quickly that not every person or table, including mine, gets to try it. I was disappointed. I love a good rosé.Wines for the steakBut at least my table had the reds to ourselves. The Cabernet from Lava Cap was delicious solo. It was subtly sweet with a fruity, dry finish. The Malbec from Ique was dry and tannic by itself. When you try the steak and the Malbec, it works out well and I've grown to like it.My dinnerAs what was demonstrated earlier, this was dinner: slices of hearty, tender rib eye steak that is cooked more rarer than medium-rare, which is fine in my book and a generous portion of sinfully creamy potatoes au gratin. Sure, it's a gut buster and will shorten my life span by a few years but it's worth it.Apple tatinMitchel ensured us that in case we don't have enough fats in our bodies that evening, he gave us a slab of apple tatin, served with crème fraîche. The tatin was served warm, crisp on the edges, and the Granny Smith apples was a good contrast for the buttery puff pastry.It was a fun and good evening. Too bad it was late and it was a weekday that I would've taken Helen to Grom for gelato.Address:Mitchel & Me Cooking Class and Dinner at Fairway Market & Café 2427 Broadway, 2nd Floor New York, NY 10023

Coconut-Lemon Sablés

Sablé cookiesThe weekend of my mom's surgery (that's two weeks ago), I baked her coconut-lemon sablé cookies. Why? She loves any and almost every coconut dessert or confection and I think cookies are a cinch to bake. I just chose sablés because she likes the crumbly, sandy texture of this rich cookie except she never remembers the name of it. As some of you bakers out there know that sablés are sort of hard to bake because of the texture, I found out from Cook's Illustrated that there's a secret to getting it right and it all goes down to...This is the secret. Shhh...A simple boiled egg. All you need is a hard boiled egg yolk that's sieved into the batter.Sieved yolkNifty, huh? As any other cookie dough you (if you do bake) worked on, the wet ingredients go in first then the flour is the final thing to dump in and stir up.As any mostly-butter-based cookie dough goes, it has to be refrigerated. Thankfully, it was a Sunday afternoon that I wasn't rushing to bake them. Though my mom kept asking me when am I going to bake and let her eat. Hmmmph. But it's worth the wait.Coconut-Lemon Sablé Cookies Adapted from Cook's Illustrated1 large egg 10 tablespoons (1 1/4 sticks) unsalted butter , softened 1/3 cup plus 1 tablespoon granulated sugar (2 3/4 ounces) 1/4 teaspoon table salt 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 1 teaspoon lemon extract 1 medium lemon, zested 1 1/2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour (7 1/2 ounces) 1/3 cup finely chopped toasted sweetened coconut 1 teaspoon large egg white, lightly beaten with 1 teaspoon water 1/3 cup finely chopped untoasted sweetened coconutInstructions 1. Place egg in small saucepan, cover with 1 inch water, and bring to boil over high heat. Remove pan from heat, cover, and let sit 10 minutes. Meanwhile, fill small bowl with ice water. Using slotted spoon, transfer egg to ice water and let stand 5 minutes. Crack egg and peel shell. Separate yolk from white; discard white. Press yolk through fine-mesh strainer into small bowl.2. In bowl of stand mixer fitted with paddle attachment, beat butter, granulated sugar, salt, and cooked egg yolk on medium speed until light and fluffy, about 4 minutes, scraping down sides of bowl and beater with rubber spatula as needed. Turn mixer to low, add vanilla, lemon extract, lemon zest, and mix until incorporated. Stop mixer; add flour and toasted sweetened coconut and mix on low speed until just combined, about 30 seconds. Using rubber spatula, press dough into cohesive mass.3. Divide dough in half; roll each piece into log about 6 inches long and 1 3/4 inches in diameter. Wrap each log in 12-inch square of parchment paper and twist ends to seal and firmly compact dough into tight cylinder. Chill until firm, about 1 hour.4. Adjust oven racks to upper-middle and lower-middle positions and heat oven to 350 degrees. Line 2 rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper. Using chef’s knife, slice dough into 1/4-inch-thick rounds, rotating dough so that it won’t become misshapen from weight of knife. Place cookies 1 inch apart on baking sheets. Using pastry brush, gently brush cookies with egg white mixture and sprinkle evenly with untoasted sweetened coconut.5. Bake until centers of cookies are pale golden brown with edges slightly darker than centers, about 15 minutes, rotating baking sheets front to back and top to bottom halfway through baking. Cool cookies on baking sheet 5 minutes; using thin metal spatula, transfer cookies to wire rack and cool to room temperature. Store cooled cookies between sheets of parchment paper in airtight container for up to 1 week.My mom is doing well. To the well wishers to my mom, she is at home from the hospital. Hell, it's been a tough two weeks for everyone in my family but at least she's ok. The expected pain from the procedure does come in on several occasions but besides that she still has an appetite. And that's a good thing.

The time is finally arriving...I'm going to Hong Kong and visit parts of southeast China this Tuesday, April 28th for the next two weeks. My bags are packed. My passport and visa is in my Alma bag that I'm taking with me (with my heavy 5D Mark II camera and lenses that weighs at least 5-7 lbs.! I think I need to see a chiropractor after vacation...). And soon to be saying \"Hello\" to Hong Kong and probably alienating them with my American/New Yorkness. I can sense the locals will be smirking or laughing at my awful pronunciations.I may or may not post during the time I'm away but you'll most likely see a trickle of photos (food and not food) I'm posting on my Flickr page. Hopefully, I'll have wi-fi access when I go to my mom's hometown in China. We'll see.

As most of you who read this blog, should know that I have a colossal sweet tooth - eating from haute restaurant desserts to a simple bowl of ice cream. Simply stating, dessert (and food, in general) has to taste delicious.Recently, I've been bestowed upon a shipment of cookies graciously given by Claire of Rich Design Cookies. Its elegant, minimalist cookie designs made me feel like I'm opening a box of cookies crafted from Tiffany. Indeed, it feels like you're opening something special and it's fit for an occasion. They're made fresh, all handmade in small batches, and they don't have preservatives.Sampling of the fourteen or so cookies, it's hard to pick a favorite. All were perfect on its own in terms of flavors - nothing is too sweet and it's balanced. Texturally, they're crisp yet slightly soft in the middle. The only exception is the chocolate dome that reminds me of a sophisticated, cake-y brownie.The sandwich cookies have a good ratio of filling to cookie and their fillings have potent flavor without overwhelming the cookie. The one that stuck out in my mind was the graham sandwich that encased the white chocolate, coconut rum liqueur ganache. The delicately flavored cookie stands up to the sweet coconutty filling. The mocha sandwich reminded me of eating a solid, chewy form of mocha with an extra espresso shot. (For the coffee lover that I am, it's a good thing.)They're visually appealing, delectable and make great gifts. If you order them as a gift yourself (they don't have a storefront or bakery), don't be like me and eat them in one sitting even though they're that good.Rich Design Cookies (website)

It's been a loong time since I've seen any of my friends because of my mom's hospitalization a few weeks earlier and prepping for my upcoming vacation. Julie commented on my blog recently wanted to see me before I'm leaving NYC, I made time last Friday to have dinner with her at 6:30. Almost by default, I've brought Helen along because she's out from work early and can accompany for pre-dinner. (What I mean by \"pre-dinner\" is consuming food right before dinner just to kill time.)It was a warm (finally) evening, Helen and I wanted ice cream. We thought of getting coffee but creamy, frozen dairy trumps caffeine during the later hours of the day. Anyway, we took the subway down to Momofuku Milk Bar & Bakery. Yes, I know most of your are thinking this place is overrated but I like this place (implicitly, the Momofuku empire) a lot.Momofuku Milk Bar & Bakery's MenusWhen we arrived there, I looked up at the menu boards and spotted the \"Coming Soon\" section, indicating the possible existence of Arnold Palmer Tea Cake and Cookie Cookie Dough. My eyes were wide open and my mind screamed, \"I WANT.\" But going back to earth, I've made up my mind about getting the Bavarian cream soft serve with banana crumble topping and Helen wanted the chocolate donut soft serve.Soft servesHelen's chocolate donut soft serve tasted like fake chocolate that's rather chemically or off-tasting. It didn't really appeal to me. As for herself, she grew to like it. My Bavarian cream soft serve was quite tasty. Smooth, creamy and it tasted like sweet, vanilla cream. The banana crumbles added some crunchy texture that I was looking for with a hint of banana.As we're finishing up our soft serves, I was really tempted to eat some relatively new plates next door, Momofuku Ssäm Bar. Helen asked if she wanted me to go and I told her in reply, \"If you want to go, we'll eat there...\" She said, \"Yeah. Let's go.\" As we're walking over to Ssäm mind went, \"Squee...\"It was early in the evening (it was 6 PM) so it wasn't that packed. There were two large parties taking over the back and the bar was about half empty. We've taken up the four-topper near the window.The Menu...Since we're trying to budget our limited stomach space, Helen and I decided upon two dishes. Thankfully, Helen is open-minded about food, she's willing to eat offals and we stuck with this theme for this impromptu pre-dinner.Mmm...beef tendonFor the first dish, we have the Sichuan beef tendon with green mango and peanuts. I know some of you are disgusted by the idea of eating beef tendon but it's really good. I like the subtle crunchiness of the tendon and toasted peanuts. The bok choy and green mango that's in there added a little refreshing, crunch factor. To give the tendon some flavor, there's cilantro and chili peppers. It's not as spicy as their spicy rice cakes that cleared my sinuses and made my stomach feel the burn. Thank goodness.Roasted foie gras, close up and Helen's holding a big bite of foieThen we moved on to the roasted foie gras with fig chutney and broiche. This particular preparation is rustic compared to what I encounter from other restaurants. It's basically two medium-sized chunks of foie pan-roasted until it's medium rare (it's slightly pink in the middle), dabbled on with sweet fig chutney and two squares of toasted brioche. It was delicious and arguably for Helen, it was a bit too liver-y tasting than what she would prefer.Baoguette Cafe signage & menuAfter finishing up pre-dinner, we walked down the densely packed, St. Mark's Place to the newly opened Baoguette Cafe. To those of you who follow NYC food news, this particular establishment was formerly the automat, Bamn! and the Baoguette enterprise is rapidly expanding (they're opening a larger venue in West Village) probably because of the recent popularity with the banh mi sandwich.Anyway, Helen and I were kind of regretting eating so much at Momofuku that we're pretty much at the point of being full while we're waiting for Julie to come over from work. But we're still going to eat because we liked what we see on the menu and try to manage to make more stomach space.When Julie arrived amidst the crowds, hugs were exchanged, and surprisingly told us that she's not that hungry either; she had a really big lunch that afternoon.Iced Vietnamese CoffeeJulie and I are coffee lovin' gals and we've ordered Vietnamese iced coffee. When we both tried our coffee, it was quite strong. It sort of tasted like there's a bit too much coffee grounds brewed into it and the condensed milk was a bit on the scant side to make it err on the sweet side. It's not bad but if I want iced coffee, I have other places in mind that does better.Pho SpecialGetting to the meal portion, Helen ordered herself the Pho Special. What came out of their kitchen was the fact that it's quite a large serving with a lot of meat (as in beef tendon and brisket) than rice noodle. At least, that's what Helen told me. I've only tried the broth and it was very beefy with hints of anise and spice.Spicy Catfish Banh Mi & Classic Banh MiAs for Julie and I, we ordered their banh mis. I've gotten the Baoguette, the classic banh mi, filled with pâté, pork terrine, pickled daikon and carrots, cucumbers, and cilantro. It has a good amount of meat filling that it's intensely porky and it adds enough salt to the sandwich. The pickled vegetables makes it sweet, tangy and crunchy. Even though, I'm not a huge fan of cilantro it makes a difference for this type of sandwich; it's pungent enough to stand up to the bold flavors and it gives it an extra something. Julie's spicy catfish filled with cucumber relish, pickled red onion, honey mustard aioli, and cilantro. The catfish is fresh and moist and I remembered liking the mustard aioli a lot. What made these sandwiches, besides the delicious, flavorful fillings, was the bread. It's crusty on the outside, soft, moist and fluffy on the inside.Too bad there isn't a sandwich shop like Baoguette near my workplace in the Upper East Side. It would make my lunchtime a lot more pleasant (except their table service is kind of rushed and haphazard because she's split between waiting tables and dealing with the take-out line).Two food trucks and Dessert Truck's menuAlthough we're all stuffed from our dinner (and pre-dinner for Helen and I), we're still willing to eat dessert. Since Baoguette's soft serves were low and the only flavor being served was the durian (which Julie and I are not too fond of that fruit and Helen isn't familiar), I proposed we go to Dessert Truck since they're over on 2nd Avenue. As we've plowed our way through the crowds on St. Mark's Place, we waited on line for dessert. Julie and I got dessert but Helen wanted an iced sweet tea from McDonald's. Yes, that American fast food chain that I would rather die of starvation than eating their food. (I know it sounds elitist but I can't eat their food. Sorry.)Goat cheesecakeAs gotten on line for her drink, Julie and I took our seats at the nearest table and start snapping photos of desserts. I had the goat cheesecake with rosemary caramel topped with fresh black raspberries and a tuile. It's arguably my favorite dessert from the Dessert Truck. It's light and creamy, not much for an intense goat cheese flavor that one normally encounter. The caramel is fluid (as you can tell from the photo above) and oozy with a hint of pine-y rosemary. The black raspberries just added that needed hit of fruity acidity. It's sooo awesome.Chocolate-y innardsJulie gotten the Dessert Truck's signature chocolate molten cake. The cake is the other end of the spectrum of what my cheesecake is, it's dense, gooey and very chocolate-y. It's best not to eat this when one has a full stomach. Except I force persuaded her to get a dessert since she never tried their stuff. She can survive...maybe.Julie & I couldn't finish...FAILExcept both of us were dying of this issue of a limited stomach space that we're calling a quits to eating. We failed. Helen urged us to eat but hell, I felt like my stomach was going to burst if I eat another bite of ANYTHING. So, Helen took it upon herself to finish what you see above and that's not an easy feat if you ate what we went through. Unless you have a bottomless stomach or like my friend, Patrick who has to eat an enormous amount of calories to sustain his weight before he withers before your very eyes...Yes, I envy him.

YES, I'm not ashamed by eating McDonald's.
I do love their Sweet Tea. (It has a word 'sweet' in it. No reason to hate)
I also collect their kid's toy, too. (Thanks for the kids in china working 18 hours a day making those toys)

That goat cheesecake looks and sounds AMAZING.  I'm still yet to go to Dessert Truck, I need to deviate from 16 Handles which has been my recent addiction!

Oh my god. The dessert truck contributed to my sugar high of '08. It was a combination of their chocolate souffle and beard papa cream puffs that sent me off the edge. Have you been to the little pomme frites place on 2nd Avenue? It's also really good!

Laura: Yes, the goat cheesecake is AMAZING. You should go and eat their stuff and drop the fro-yo. I do respect the fro-yo lovers but I'm not a big fan of it. In all respect, if one wants a dessert, just go all the way (in terms of fat and flavor).Food Marathon: I think LA should have some tasty stuff. I know they have better Mexican food than NYC but I don't know about inventiveness.Grace: I've tried Pommes Frites before I started my blog (yeah, that's a loong time ago) and remembered it was good. Especially their crazy sauces.

Baoguette does indeed rock. I like the spicy catfish the best (so far!) I need need need to get over to Milk Bar. And dessert truck!Cali has the Korean Taco Truck (Kagi) as well, which is, I hear, pretty durned good.

Summary of Meals During The Month of March

***CONTENT
Apologies for the almost non-existence of me blogging. It's been hectic for the past month with my mom's health went on limbo; going back and forth from home to the hospital. She's fine for the time being and at home. As for me, I haven't been eating out a whole lot because of my mom and been living off of lots of coffee but still tired despite being caffeinated. Buh. I can't win. Anyhoo, here's where I've been to whilst I have a few hours to myself during the month of March.For a very long time, like during mid-winter, I've been craving for soup dumplings. Why? Well, because I never had one but seen a vast amount of soup dumpling food porn from Robyn's Flickr photostream are feeding the fire. I've read somewhere on Chowhound that there were restaurants that serve soup dumplings! So, I had to make arrangements to eat out with a few people so I've brought along my co-workers, Mary and Liz to join me for lunch at Shanghai Pavillion. (It's not a typo, it's how they spelled \"pavilion\" it.)Interior and my friendsStepping in from the chilly, windy streets of the Upper East Side, we settled in our seats to an upscale Chinese restaurant filled with mostly non-Asian diners. Not unusual but I was hoping there would be some besides myself and Mary.Soup dumps!The pork soup dumplings arrived and the waiter served our soup dumplings. Since we're pretty much novices to eating a soup dumpling, we tried taking small bites off of it. Some fared slightly messy, as in a trail of broth leaking out into ones soup spoon, or as graceful as I was, it sprayed all over my plate. Fair warning: this isn't sexy food, people.The dumpling's skin was chewy, not so thick or thin and the filing was porky and had enough salt. I just wish the tongs they gave us wasn't pierced since the dumplings started to leak out as I picked up my second one.AppetizersSince we can't just live on two soup dumplings, we opted for the lunch special. When our appetizers arrived, they looked different than what we excepted. The soups are not what what it's indicated on the menu. My tomato and egg soup is basically egg drop soup with a teaspoon's worth of diced tomatoes. Mary's corn soup is pretty much the same except the obvious of having corn kernels. Liz's spring roll looked decent for what it is. I didn't try it.Our entreesMoving on to our entrees, Liz's beef with string beans were quite nice. The beans were cooked through yet still crisp. The beef was tender and the dish wasn't salty nor oily. Mary's ma po tofu was quite a spicy kicker. The tofu was silky, soft and the sauce was hot enough to make me cough a bit. I was hoping there was some minced pork bits floating around the sauce but this was vegetarian (at least in appearance). As for my pork with chili and dry bean curd, it was pleasantly hot that my palate was warmed by the chili peppers. The texture of the dry bean curd almost imitated my shredded pork's texture except a little bit drier.The lunch was good probably a bit expensive for what it's worth but this is the Upper East Side.The same day when I went out to Shanghai Pavillion, I met up with Giulia and her friend for dinner at Shake Shack. Yes, I'm nuts. As you might know, I am a big fan of their burgers but Giulia has never eaten their burger. She just heard about my ramblings of how awesome it tastes. Poor thing.Shake Shake UWS' exterior and the lineWhen I met up with Giulia, the place was already packed because they're reserving the downstairs seating area for a private event. It's inconvenient just because everyone is waiting for a table to sit and eat their food and knowing that it's a Friday evening, it's not going to be pretty. But thankfully, Giulia and her friend already held down a table before I got here.Giulia & John's tray of food (left); Giulia's first Shack burger (right)Giulia and John received their food first. (We've ordered separately but sharing the concrete.) Just looking at the glory of Giulia's first Shake Shack burger, I know she'll be a very happy girl by the time she's sinking her teeth in. What she told me about her burger was that she's surprised how juicy and tasty the burger was despite the fact it was cooked to a medium. John didn't say much because he had laryngitis but he was content with his burger and fries.Shacky Road ConcreteThe Shacky Road Concrete made of their own dense, creamy chocolate custard, blended with almonds, large chunks (about the size of a die), and marshmallows. Basically, it's a decadent version of the traditional Rocky Road. It's decadent because frozen custard has a higher butterfat and egg yolk content than regular ice cream. This concrete tasted good but I felt like it's missing something to make it memorable.Mushroom-cheese bomb of deliciousnessWhen my buzzer finally alarmed me to get my food, I happily ate my 'Shroom burger. I was having a huge craving for gooey melted cheese and this burger is no exception. Imagine a large, crispy, fried, globe of portobello mushroom encased with a vast amount of melted muenster cheese, topped with a crisp green, fresh lettuce leaf, a slice of sweet tomato and Shack sauce. It also helps that this entire concoction is sandwiched in a soft, buttered bun that's slightly toasted. Sweet jesus, I'm getting hungry just thinking about this burger again. Haha...Cinnamon toast custardThe frozen custard flavor of the day (back in March and on a Friday) was cinnamon toast. I shared the single dip since I tried to stomach some of the concrete earlier. Anyway, I love this custard more than the concrete. I loved the bold cinnamon-sugar flavor. But it's not too cinnamony that it feels like it's too spicy, it's just perfect.GromFor some strange reason, my stomach was going to explode after eating at Shack Shack (usually I do) that I asked Giulia if she's up for gelato at Grom. Surprisingly enough, she had room for more dessert. That shocked me. Anyhow, I walked them over there and bestowed upon a very good place for gelato.Giulia's cup of sorbet(?!)Despite the fact that we're in a gelateria, Giulia opted for sorbets. Only. In my opinion, it kind of defeats the purpose of going to a gelateria. I would go piling on gelato when I'm in one but she said that when she was in Italy with her family and they go out for gelato, she always have sorbet. I think it's weird but I respect her choice.Anyway, she gotten herself a medium cup of mandarin orange and pomelo sorbets. When I tried a spoon of each flavor, they screamed ripe citrus fruits. The mandarin orange tasted like a sunshine of sweet, mellowed orange and the pomelo tasted like a not-so-tart grapefruit. It all went well together, even though it isn't gelato.My cup of pistachio gelato and lemon sorbetWhen it comes to Grom, for me, that is, I almost always order their pistachio. It screams creamy, buttery, pistachio goodness in every bite. I paired it with their smooth, lemon sorbet because it's tart and refreshing. And something to nullify the fat content of the gelato. Ahem.Addresses:Shanghai Pavillion 1378 3rd Avenue (between E 78th & E 79th Streets) New York, NY 10075 (map)Shake Shack 366 Columbus Avenue (between W 77th & W 78th Streets) New York, NY 10024 (map)Grom 2165 Broadway (between W 76th & 77th Streets) New York, NY 10024 (map)

Hi! First time commenter, but I'm an avid reader and love your blog!
I was smiling while reading your bit about how to eat a soup dumpling as gracefully as possible, without losing all of the soup. My mom taught me this when I was little and I've taught friends....put the dumpling on your spoon (use that instead of the tongs save the juice!), lift the dumpling with your chopsticks and take tiny little bite to break it open. Then gently pour out the soup onto your spoon. Slurp that up and then put the dumpling back on your spoon, add the sauce and then eat the dumpling! It cools it down while you enjoy the teaspons of soup...better than scorching your mouth and losing the good flavor all over your plate!Wishing your mom a speedy recovery!

I've got to agree that the pistachio gelato at grom is a must-order, for all the reasons you explained.

I have a similar method to eating soup dumplings as Hellogirlster, except I slurp up the soup from the tiny hole I've bitten on the top part of the dumpling. I also ladle in some of the soy sauce/vinegar/ginger concoction that usually comes on the side into the dumpling and it makes everything taste amazing.If you haven't tried it yet, you MUST have the soup dumplings at Joe's Shanghai. I think they are the best. I always go to the one in Chinatown but they have a more convenient location on 56th between 5th and 6th Avenue. Happy eating!

Danny: Yeah, I thought it I wasn't reading the Chowhound post correctly but indeed it DOES EXIST. I've read Robyn's post about Pig Heaven about it as well as another Chowhound post that it's good. Probably I'll visit there when I feel like staying within the UES.Hellogirlster: Hi! Thanks for commenting and be my avid reader!As for the soup dumpling eating tip, it shall help a ton. I don't know when I'll be eating soup dumps soon but I'll keep this in mind. Thank you!ChuckEats: Ah, good to hear someone who agrees with me. :) And you are an epicurean more so than I.thechiconomist.celine I heard Joe's Shanghai is good. I don't know if it's the best since everyone has their own opinion but I'll visit there whenever I feel like eating Chinese food outside of home. Thanks for the suggestion. :)

Hooray, you have a soup dump purveyor in your area!I like that you got gelato/sorbet...after the concrete and custard. :)PIG HEAVEN IS THE BEST NAME EVER.

Hello readers! I'm back in NYC over a week ago. I would have written a short post indicating this fact but, uh, I was dying of jet lag. A 12-hour difference and boarding on a 16-hour flight (with insomnia effecting me) doesn't help my sense of time when I got back home.Anyhoo, during my 12-day vacation (13 is a full flying/unpacking day), I spent about 7 days in Hong Kong (total; broken into two parts), 1 day in Shenzhen, China and the other 4 in Zhuhai, China and Macau. Yeah, it's sort of a big southeast Asian trek of LOTS OF EATING and shopping (food and apparel). I never seen that many kitties whenever I wake up in the morning and open my door (in my aunt's place in HK). Honestly, I never eaten that much food in my entire life - eating out almost every day and night.Many thanks to my two aunts (in Hong Kong and Zhuhai) and my grandmother being gracious hosts, welcoming me into their homes during my stay and being my food and travel guides. It's great seeing you all despite the fact it's been nearly 17 years since I've seen you all.As for my readers, please be patient as I'm slowly editing my vacation photos - food and tourist/family (I'm up to day 9 of 12). Probably I'll be writing a recent NYC dinner/outing first then proceed with my vacation. Just hang on a few more days and I'll start writing up.
