The Pembroke: How To Eat Well In Earls Court

Over the years, some of the best meals I’ve had in London have followed a hellish journey on the District line. That meandering green bit on the tube map will take you from Ealing to Upminster, if you've got the time, and there are some great meals to be had along the way. (The Establishment at Parsons Green or Tayyabs near Aldgate East, for example). The next time I’ve got a day to spare, I might even go to Wimbledon - if only to test my theory that food simply tastes better when you’re forced to wait for it. Last Friday, our District line destination was West Brompton. Once there, we stumbled from sunny Old Brompton Road into a dark and cavernous gastropub now known as The Pembroke. It used to be one of London’s most famous gay pubs, The Coleherne, but after a refurb from Realpubs last year, the grand old building has been transformed into a thoroughly modern pub and dining room. The predictable gastro flourishes are all there - chandeliers, ‘feature’ wallpaper, leather banquettes - but it looks rather good in a comfy, unpretentious way. There’s a horseshoe-shaped bar and an upstairs room full of Chesterfields for the drinkers, while the smart dining area to the rear is a cosy space with a view of the semi-open kitchen. The daily-changing menus are written in flamboyant script on huge blackboards, while ‘ironic’ floral lampshades swing above roomy booths. On our visit, they were adding the finishing touches to a small but sunny first floor terrace that will undoubtedly prove popular this summer. Still a ‘proper pub’ at heart, the bar offers a decent range of beers and real ales, while the wine list is concise, food-friendly and well-priced. The menu is similarly appealing, with classics like Shepherd’s Pie and fish and chips sitting alongside more modern options like seafood tempura and lamb with herb couscous. With plenty of carefully sourced ingredients on offer - the cheese, for example, comes from La Cave a Fromage in South Ken - the price are quite remarkable. Only the steak comes in at £17, with most other dishes coming in at under a tenner. My tagliatelle with spicy chorizo sauce was exactly that - fresh al dente pasta with a fiery sauce of tomatoes, chunks of chorizo, plenty of garlic and a welcome hit of chilli. It’s the sort of dish you could easily knock up at home but if it’s on offer for £7 in your local, why would you? Having demolished the dish in record time, I helped myself to my companion’s chargrilled swordfish on a bed of baby spinach and avocado. With the added bonus of a fresh mango and red onion salsa, spiked with lime and coriander, it was light and full of flavour - a perfect summer dish. For dessert, my white chocolate and vanilla cheesecake arrived not as a skinny slice but as a generous individual portion; the flavours lifted beautifully by a zesty scoop of passion fruit sorbet. A lemon crème brulee was less inspiring but still an enjoyable palate cleanser. Whether you pop in for lunch, after work, or at the weekend; you could easily get comfortable here. The Earls Court gay community may still be mourning the loss of The Coleherne, but the new incarnation is working hard to win over the locals. The kitchen has proved it can cook reasonably priced dishes with flair but without fuss - how many of the new breed gastropubs can say the same? If we don’t return for the food alone, it’s certainly top of the ‘to do’ list when we’re next in Earls Court and it should be on yours too.

Now Open: USA Steakhouse The Palm Arrives in Belgravia

What? The first UK branch of American steakhouse chain, Palm, which now has over 20 locations across the US. The interior of their London restaurant wouldn’t look out of place in Boston or Chicago, with plenty of hard wood, sleek banquettes and quirky caricatures designed to echo their signature style overseas. When? Soft open from today, they’re offering an impressive 50% discount until the official launch on Friday. Where? 1 Pont Street (the former site of Drones), between Knightsbridge and Sloane Square. Expect a well-heeled mixed of SW1 locals and high-power business types. Why? Because you can never have too many steakhouses. If you’ve got a client to impress or just need to refuel after a day out in Knightsbridge, you can’t go wrong with American-style steaks and seafood. The menu is predictably heavy on the meat with hefty cuts of aged USDA prime beef on offer. Choose from filet mignon, New York sirloin, or something from their ‘British selection’ like 6oz lamb chops or a 14oz rib eye. If you’re not a beef enthusiast, you can feast on steamed lobster, crab cakes with mango salsa, or simply grilled fresh fish. During the day, The Palm will also serve classic crowd-pleasers like sirloin steak sandwiches; sesame seared tuna salad; jumbo shrimp cocktail; and their signature Palm burger with French fries. You can check out the full dinner menu here. How much? Steaks start at £25 so The Palm is clearly aiming at the ‘what recession?’ lunch-on-expenses category. However, there is a prix fixe lunch menu which offers two courses for £15. If you go easy on the wine, it could be an affordable one-off treat. So, what do you reckon? Does London really need another steakhouse? (We've already had Goodman, Sophie's and High Timber in the last six months!) If you pop in to take advantage of the opening week discount, let us know how you get on.

After our recent trip to the Real Food Festival, we can’t wait for Taste of London next month. In less than a month’s time, Regent’s Park will be full of top chefs, restaurants and producers ready to feed thousands of hungry foodies. Fingers crossed for sunshine! If you’re not already convinced by the thought of four days of feasting, here are ten reasons why you should visit Taste this year: 1. Eat your way around London’s finest restaurants Ever wondered how many restaurants you could eat at in one day? At Taste, you could eat at Quo Vadis, L’Anima, Hereford Road and Fino – all in under an hour, without breaking the bank. 40 of London’s top restaurants will be in attendance this year including Boxwood Café, Pied a Terre, Tom’s Kitchen, Le Gavroche, Cinnamon Kitchen, Alain Ducasse, L’Atelier de Joel Robuchon, Launceston Place and Salt Yard. 2. Taste iconic signature dishes from some of London’s top chefs In addition to the usual three course menus, many of the chefs will be offering limited edition ‘icon dishes’ using luxury ingredients. Some of the must-try dishes include a veal and foie gras burger (Boxwood Café); fettuccine with wild mushrooms and summer truffle (L’Anima); slow-cooked Iberico pig cheeks (Salt Yard); and Thai calamari (Busaba Eattai). 3. Watch high-profile chefs in action in the Taste Theatre This year, wine buff Olly Smith will be the Taste Theatre compere and there’s an impressive line-up of celeb chefs on offer. There will be demos and quick-fire cook-offs from chefs like Marcus Wareing, Jun Tanaka (Pearl), Bryn Williams (Odette’s), Atul Kochar (Benares), Angela Hartnett (Murano) and Richard Corrigan. Check out the full timetable here. 4. Pick up some culinary hints and tips in the Taste Kitchen Hosted by Waitrose Executive Chef Neil Nugent and food consultant Bianca Nice, the Taste Kitchen will run hourly food demos to show visitors how to prepare original, exciting dishes. Grab a seat and learn how to cook slow-cooked pig cheeks with pea tops and seared scallops; asparagus and poached egg salad; and taleggio pannacotta. 5. Pick up boutique bottles from across the globe with Taste Wine In addition to the Wine Theatre, Taste will be home to a number of boutique winemakers this year. Connoisseurs and novices alike can try wines from Jordan, Moldova and further afield, as well as rare bottles from Argentina, New Zealand, Bordeaux, and South Africa. 6. Celebrate food en Francais in the French Flair Theatre London has an insatiable appetite for French food so this year Taste are celebrating all things Gallic with a brand new theatre. If you fancy learning classic techniques from chefs like Jean-Christophe Ansanay-Alex (Ambassade de l’Ile) and Frank Raymond (Mon Plaisir), book your tickets now! 7. Get a Taste of Thailand without heading East If you’re looking for something exotic, head for the Taste of Thailand corner and try some authentic specialties from Benja, Nahm, Blue Elephant, Mango Tree and Busaba Eathai. There will be traditional dancing, plenty of things to buy and drinks from Thai Square on offer too. 8. Live the high life with a Champagne Masterclass If you’ve got money to burn, why not treat yourself to an exclusive champagne and seafood pairing? Hosted by Laurent-Perrier Champagne and priced at £75, we can’t think of a better way to toast summer! 9. Shop ‘til you drop with producers from across the UK and beyond If you’ve been before, you know the drill – there are hundreds of lovely local producers in attendance, usually handing out a fair few freebies. Look out for some of our favourites like Tanqueray gin, Flour Power City bakery, Bea’s of Bloomsbury, and Simply Real Sausages. Remember to bring your smartest eco-friendly shopping bag with you! 10. Get a grilling in Calor’s al fresco dining area Proving that al fresco food can be more than just burnt bangers, Calor’s stand will give advice on creating tasty barbecued dishes, with recipe influences from around the world. With tips and tricks from the chefs and a burger cook-off, you’ll be transformed into a King of the Grill in no time. You can order your tickets online now but we’ll be giving some away later this week, so stay tuned!

Snap Of The Week: Sweets From The Sri Lankan Kitchen

***CONTENT
Earlier this year we looked at some of the best new cookbooks on offer, including Serendip - a visually stunning collection of stories and recipes from Peter Kuruvita's Sri Lankan kitchen. Our pre-ordered copy finally arrived last week and we've been leafing through the curry-laden pages ever since. Sadly it was far too hot to slave over a stove on this weekend, so we decided to keep it simple and make kiri bath. \"Kiri bath has a special place in Sri Lanka's culinary delights,\" explains Kuruvita, \"A simple thick rice pudding made with coconut milk, then cut into diamond shapes, it is central to festival offerings and celebrations.\" He recommends eating it with leftover curry or lunu miris, a fiery condiment made from red onion, Maldive fish flakes, lime and plenty of chilli. If you don't fancy mixing sweet and savoury, try serving it warm with a cup of chai for an exotic elevenses treat. To make kiri bath, cook 450g of washed long-grain rice with two 400ml tins of coconut milk, four bruised cardamon pods and a teaspoon of salt in a non-stick saucepan. When the liquid has evaporated to the level of the rice, stir in 150ml of coconut cream and then cover and simmer until the rice is cooked. We added a splash of condensed milk for extra sweetness and then pressed the mixture into a brownie tin. Once it's had a few minutes to set, you can flip it out and cut it into the traditional diamond shapes. It's rich, creamy and deliciously gooey - perfect for elevenses or after a spicy meal. Serendip would be a great gift for Sri Lankan food fans or curry connoisseurs who want to try something new. It retails at £25 but you can pick it up for £13.75 on Amazon.

I am currently reviewing Serendip for my blog and after flipping through it three times to find something to make, I chose fish cutlets (potato and fresh tuna with fresh curry leaves, onion and cumin). They are meant to be a snack food, but in my case, they were my dinner!

Following the success of his first book The Accidental Vegetarian; Simon Rimmer recently served up another helping of innovative and flavour-packed vegetarian recipes. Based on the menu at his award-winning restaurant, Greens, The Seasoned Vegetarian features internationally-inspired dishes and creative flavour combinations that will appeal to vegetarians and carnivores alike. Here’s one of his simple but delicious recipes for you to try out during National Vegetarian Week. Pumpkin salad with Yorkshire fettle cheese Simons says, “From the moment this dish went on the menu it has sold like hot cakes (strange comparison I know). Yorkshire fettle cheese, from Shepherd’s Purse creamery, is a great example of how brilliant our cheesemakers are. This cheese has all the characteristics of a feta, with the added oomph of a Wensleydale. Combined with sweet pumpkin, pine nuts and the rest, it makes for a good year-round salad.” Ingredients: 300g (10oz) pumpkin, peeled and cubed 3-4 tbsp vegetable oil, for roasting 200g (7oz) Yorkshire fettle cheese, cubed 150g (5oz) pine nuts, toasted handfuls of watercress, rocket and baby spinach 3 radishes, sliced 150g (5oz) peas, cooked Dressing: 150ml (1/4 pint) extra virgin olive oil juice of 2 limes 1 tbsp cider vinegar 1 tbsp chopped fresh mint 1 garlic clove, crushed salt and freshly ground black pepper 1. Preheat the oven to 200C/ Fan 180C/ Gas Mark 6. Heat the oil in a roasting tin, add the pumpkin and roast for about 30 minutes until golden and soft. Drain on kitchen paper and season well.2. Combine the pumpkin with the rest of the salad ingredients in a large bowl.3. Make the dressing by putting all the ingredients in a screw-top jar and shaking it up like crazy.4. Drizzle the dressing over the salad and toss all of it together. We've got four copies of The Seasoned Vegetarian to give away. If you want to impress a veggie or cut back on your weekly meat intake, just enter the competition here.

If you’ve had your fill of bland salads and tasteless nut roasts over the years, don’t panic – some of London’s finest ethnic eateries are celebrating National Vegetarian Week with menus that are full of Eastern promise. At London’s favourite Thai restaurant, Mango Tree, they’re serving up fragrant yellow curry with chickpeas and butternut squash, deep fried salt and pepper tofu, and light herb and vegetable rolls – a perfect summer snack. Their sister restaurant, Awana, is joining in too, with classic Malaysian dishes like shredded bean and pineapple salad and king oyster mushroom stir-fry. Don’t miss the tohu kukus – steamed silken tofu topped with leek and pepper spaghetti and a rich yellow bean and garlic sauce. For a meat-free mid-week lunch, try Min Jiang on the tenth floor of Kensington's Royal Garden Hotel. If the impressive views over Hyde Park don't seduce you, the £15 vegetarian express lunch certainly will. Available Monday to Friday, the menu includes hot and sour soup, a dim sum platter, wok-fried rice with minced vegetables, and braised beancurd with Sichuan chilli sauce. A glass of house red or white wine will only raise the bill to £19.50 and you'll still be back at your desk on time. If you’re craving curry, head for The Cinnamon Club and feast on the all-vegetarian garden menu designed by Executive Chef Vivek Singh. Inspired by the Chelsea Flower Show, his menu has a floral theme – starting with a hibiscus and rose petal bellini and finishing with a rose petal and milk carom seed crumble. In between, there are crisp zucchini flowers with pomegranate raita; grilled aubergine with citrus morel and saffron sauce; and asparagus spears with kadhai spices. Priced at £60, the menu is guaranteed to please discerning veggies and carnivores alike! For those who like their flavours fresh and fruity, Mela are serving an exotic ‘Fruits of India’ menu at their restaurants in Covent Garden, Redhill and Herne Hill. With most restaurants focusing on vegetables, Head Chef Kuldeep Singh has chosen to highlight seasonal Indian fruits with dishes like fruit and nut stuffed potatoes with Kashmiri curry sauce; jack fruit biryani; and paneer cheese stuffed with gooseberries in a mild cashew curry. Still hungry? Rasa, Sagar and Woodlands serve vegetarian South Indian food all year round. These chains have branches all over London so you’re never far away from a quality curry. We love their dosas – traditional thin pancakes with fillings like spicy potatoes, onions and peas. Perfect for mopping up the fiery lentil sambhar. Don't forget old favourites like Ram's in Harrow, Vasanta Bhavan in East Ham; Chi Vegan Noodle Bar in Covent Garden; and Govinda's in Soho.

Starting next Monday, National Vegetarian Week will be focusing on the environmental benefits of giving up meat. Where better to celebrate than at London’s most glamorous vegan restaurant – Saf in Shoreditch. Whether you’re a raw food junkie or a hardcore herbivore, you’ll love their vegan-friendly approach to fine dining. Throughout Veg Week, Saf are offering a special Power Lunch deal that starts with a deliciously guilt-free salad of herbs, radishes, sprouts, flowers and citrus miso dressing. To follow, there's a choice of spicy coconut laksa with tofu and mushrooms; whole grain pasta puttanesca; or Saf’s botanical burger – a high protein vegan burger on a wholemeal bun with lettuce, micro sprouts, tomatoes and mushroom sauce. Priced at just £8.25, the team can even serve the two courses together to get you recharged and back to work within the hour. Also, on Monday, the restaurant is hosting its first wine club dinner with a ‘celebrate Spring’ theme. The dinner will be held in their private dining room from 7pm and guests are invited to bring along a bottle of ‘Spring’ wine – whatever that might mean. As Saf is passionate about organic and biodynamic wine, the bottle you bring should be naturally produced and vegan-friendly. Rather than a small flight of tasty canapés, Chef David Bailey has created an impressive seven-course botanical menu full of fresh flavours and seasonal produce. Dishes will include steamed spring asparagus with leek vinaigrette; mushroom and white truffle risotto; and South American tacos filled with pineapple salsa, tomato chutney and homemade guacamole. If you’ve still got room, there’s lychee granite and chocolate orange torte for dessert. Guided by sommelier Joe McCanta, you will get a chance to discuss the wines on offer, the various regions they come from, the processes used, and – most importantly – how well they match the food. Tickets are priced at £50 per head and you can secure your place by emailing Joe at joe.mccanta@safrestaurant.co.uk. Looking for vegetarian food elsewhere? Check out our 'Best For Vegetarian' list.

From May 19th to 23rd, the Chelsea Flower Show will once again be packed full of local gardening enthusiasts and day-trippers from further afield. If, like us, you would rather eat flowers than look at them – you’re in luck! The pink flowers on the map below indicate restaurants in the surrounding area that are offering floral-themed menus and creative cocktails. If you’re just looking for somewhere good to eat nearby, the little daffodils highlight some reliable local favourites. View Eat Out: Chelsea Flower Show in a larger map Daphne’s – The Chelsea Flower Show menu is priced at £22.50 for two courses and £26.50 for three. Dishes include deep-fried courgette flowers with mozzarella and tomato salsa; chargrilled chicken breast with peas, broad beans and pancetta; and elderflower jelly with strawberry ripple ice-cream. Brompton Quarter Café – From 3pm to 5pm, the café is serving a Luxury Floral Tea including homemade sandwiches garnished with edible flowers, warm scones and their signature flower Danish pastry. With a pot of flower tea or a refreshing still lemonade, it will set you back £14.95 per head. (Alternatively, pop in earlier for their ‘La Vie En Rose’ set lunch menu). Ghost Inc – One of South Ken’s hottest bars will be adding edible pansies to alcoholic creations like their limited edition Chelsea Flower cocktail – a blend of elderflower-infused vodka, rhubarb, sugar syrup, lemon juice and Perrier Jouet champagne. Delicious! The Cinnamon Club – Chef Vivek Singh’s floral menu (£60) starts with a hibiscus and rose petal bellini and finishes with a rose petal and milk carom seed crumble. In between, there are crisp zucchini flowers with pomegranate raita; grilled aubergine with citrus morel and saffron sauce; and asparagus spears with kadhai spices. The Botanist – If you’re near Sloane Square, pop into the ever-popular Botanist and try the Lavender Bloom cocktail (honey and apricot liqueur and Champagne muddled with fresh lavender) or a Jasmine Blossom (mandarin-infused vodka, Champagne and jasmine syrup). Le Cercle – The floral menu is priced between £17 and £37 depending on the number of courses and matching wines you go for. Dishes include violet scented coley; a spring salad with rose petal vinaigrette; and a lavender crème brulee with apricot. Roussillon – Chef Alexis Gauthier is well known for his elegant vegetarian menus and this year’s Flower Show menu is no exception. Priced at £65, it’s not cheap but features culinary show-stoppers like the open ravioli of purple and green watercress and a deliciously light chrysanthemum soufflé. Harvey Nichols Fifth Floor Restaurant – The restaurant is serving traditional afternoon tea between 2.30pm and 5pm to celebrate the launch of the new garden-inspired fragrance by Laura Mercier. In the bar, cocktail aficionados can sip floral-themed creations like the ‘London in Bloom Martini’ – an elegant blend of gin, orange flower water, fresh rhubarb and lychee, topped with lavender sugar.

In the city-eating office, we’re big fans of the USA. Not only for the food-driven cities like New York and the generous portion sizes, but also for their obscene junk food. Deep-fried Coke anyone? A McGriddle? Or maybe just some cheese fries covered in ranch dressing? Come on, they’re only 2900 calories! We thought nothing could top the Luther Burger (a cheeseburger with a glazed donut bun), but this week we were introduced to the super-sweet world of Cinnabons. At first glance, these massive iced cinnamon buns look fairly harmless but a couple of bites later and you’re well on your way to a sugar coma. If you like Krispy Kreme donuts, you’re going to love these things. Before the box arrived on our doorstep, we had never heard of Cinnabons but a bit of furtive Googling revealed that there are over 700 branches worldwide, mostly in the US and the Middle East. They aren’t mass produced junk though – each cinnamon bun is handmade on site and then topped with sweet cream frosting after baking. They even use the legendary Makara cinnamon from Indonesia, which – if you’re a spice nerd – you’ll know is the best you can get. The result? A moist, light chunk of doughy goodness, slathered in sticky icing. They’re best served warm but we devoured ours fresh out of the box and there were no complaints. Admittedly, they’re not ideal if you’re watching your waistline but for something sweet to dunk in your morning coffee, they’re ideal. You could power an entire IT team for days on these things. (We did!) You can pick up a classic Cinnabon for £3.50 or a box of four for £10 at their shiny new London branches on Oxford Street, Queensway or inside the Trocadero. Smaller appetites can opt for super-cute Minibons and sugar junkies can go all out with a box of Caramel Pecanbons. Just keep a wet wipe handy – they’re sticky!

We popped into the Real Food Festival tonight to do a bit of food shopping and chat to some of the UK's finest producers. We didn't stick around for the Sheep Show but we did take a few snaps of our favourite stands. If you're going this weekend, look out for some of these gourmet goodies... One of our first stops was at Keen's Cheddar to pick up a sizeable wedge of Somerset cheese. At the Bristol Pasta Company stand, a bit of excellent timing gave us the chance to taste fresh butternut squash and amaretti ravioli, piping hot, covered in parmesan cheese. Bliss. Pasta fans should also look out for more unusual options at La Tua Pasta like funky pink beetroot and ricotta and jet black squid ink tortelloni filled with crab.

From May 12th to 14th, the Farringdon branch of Vivat Bacchus is hosting their first South African Wine Festival to coincide with the London International Wine Fair at Excel. The team are inviting connoisseurs and novices alike to join them for dinner, tastings and to chat with the visiting wine makers. It’s a great chance to taste some of the best wines from the Cape and to meet people who are working to improve the quality and image of South African wine, making it one of the lead wine producing areas of the world. Over three nights, the restaurant will host tastings (priced at £15 per head) in the wine room with guests like Paul Cluver, Paul Boutinot (Waterkloof), Gyles Webb (Thelema), Rollo Gabb (Journey's End), and many more. Those who book for dinner (£59) will enjoy a five course meal created by Chef Stuart Ferguson, with each dish designed to match the featured wines. For full details, check out the Wine Club page on their website. Want to combine good food and fine wine elsewhere? Try Terroirs in Covent Garden; Vinoteca in Farringdon; Shampers on Kingly Street; or Viva Verdi in Southwark.

On May 5th, Mexico will be commemorating their victory over the French Empire at the Battle of Puebla in 1862 with traditional Cinco de Mayo festivities. If you fancy getting in on the action without leaving the capital, why not celebrate in style at some of London’s most popular Mexican restaurants? At Wahaca in Covent Garden, they’re celebrating by launching a new summer menu focusing on fresh flavours and lighter options – perfect for warm weather dining. On May 4th and 5th, they’re celebrating by giving away a shot of Gran Centenario’s Blanco Tequila to every customer. Don’t miss out! It’s all change at Benito’s Hat in Goodge Street where they’re unveiling a new bar and introducing some new tequila cocktails with summery flavours like watermelon and apple. On Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday next week, they’re running a two-for-one deal on the new drinks so grab a friend and join the queue. If you’re lucky enough to live or work near Leather Lane, you probably already know about Daddy Donkey. If you don’t, head down for lunch mid-week and grab a burrito to go. They’re among the best you’ll find in London, and their tacos are pretty good too. Look out for the lime green van on nearby Whitecross Street too – Luardo’s does pretty much the same thing with similar success. For burritos on the run, you can’t go wrong with Chilango. The Fleet Street original and new Upper Street branch are both excellent and won’t do much damage to your wallet. Want to eat Mexican elsewhere? Try Tortilla in Islington or Southwark; Santo or El Camino on Portobello Road; Nineteen Ten at Westfield; or Mercado in Stoke Newington. Arriba!

With all the time Marco, Saint Jamie and Big Sweary Gordon spend on TV, it’s no wonder they’re rarely seen in their own kitchens. While they’re busy ranting at hopeless restaurateurs and lecturing chubby kids, some of London’s best restaurants are filling up with some exceptional female chefs. Why not try a testosterone-free meal at one of these girl-powered eateries this weekend? Gordon Ramsay at Royal Hospital Road – Clare Smyth At just 29, Clare Smyth took over as Head Chef at London’s only three Michelin starred restaurant - Gordon Ramsay at Hospital Road. Ramsay, who once said ‘British women can’t cook to save their lives’, was blown away by her skill and composure in the kitchen. She has been working hard in the Great British Menu kitchen this week, representing Northern Ireland with her interpretation of classic dishes like crubeens (pigs trotters) and roast rack of spring lamb with Irish stew. (If you missed it, you can catch up on BBC iPlayer). Hélène Darroze at The Connaught Dividing her time between the UK and her two Michelin starred restaurant in Paris, Darroze is passionate about the regional, seasonal flavours of South West France. She earned The Connaught its first star this year and also oversees their less formal but equally excellent bistro, Espelette. Le Gavroche – Rachel Humphrey After 40 years of male domination in the kitchens of Le Gavroche, former sous-chef Rachel Humphrey broke through to become the restaurant’s first female Head Chef in 2008. Michel Roux Jnr has praised her excellent understanding of French cuisine, as well as her ability to lead the kitchen of one of London’s most celebrated restaurants.

Next Tuesday (April 21st), Celebrity Masterchef winner and soon-to-be solo star Liz McClarnon will be providing London’s city slickers with a well-deserved credit crunch lunch. At 11:45am, Broadgate Circle in the heart of the City will be transformed into a fine dining restaurant – complete with string quartet, personal waiter service and traditional British food prepared by Liz and her team of experienced chefs. The menu will include some of the nation’s best loved dishes, including cottage pie and sausage and mash. There’s no need to book and there’s no catch – it’s totally free! However, if you enjoyed your lunch and are feeling a little generous, remember to tip your waiter. All proceeds raised will go to the housing and homelessness charity, Shelter, who are supporting the event. The nearest station to Broadgate Circle is Liverpool Street and here’s a link to a map of the area. Don't be late!

Fed Up Of Fake Pizzas? Try The Real Deal At Rossopomodoro

***CONTENT
The managing director of the Rossopomodoro pizza chain is so fed up with Londoners eating unauthentic pizzas that he has launched a ‘pizza amnesty’ at his restaurants in Chelsea, Notting Hill and Covent Garden. Simone Falco said, “Let’s face it, the quality of most pizzas in the UK is abysmal, they are nothing like real Italian pizza and companies should stop claiming that they are. It's pulling the wool over the eyes of the UK consumer.\" The amnesty will allow customers to trade their supermarket ‘fakes’ for an authentic Neapolitan pizza at any of the Rosspomodoro restaurants. All of the ingredients used in their pizzas are imported from Naples, including the water for the dough, and they are made by chefs who are specially trained in the art of traditional Neapolitan pizza making. The pizza amnesty will run until Wednesday 6th May (Monday-Wednesday only) in exchange for any pizza on the main menu. We recommend the Vesuvio, topped with buffalo ricotta, mozzarella, Neapolitan salami and their homemade tomato sauce. Delicious!

From April 15th to May 25th, Akashi-Tai Sake Brewery is hosting London’s first Cherry Blossom Festival in conjunction with some of London’s finest restaurants. In Japan, Hanami is a celebration of the beauty of the delicate cherry blossoms and the arrival of Spring. Every year, the Japanese take part in processional walks through parks and enjoy sake-fuelled feasts under the trees. The UK version celebrates the growth of Japanese culture in the capital, which now boasts well over 200 Japanese restaurants. The restaurants taking part in the Cherry Blossom Festival have each created limited edition dishes or complete menus to celebrate Hanami, reflecting traditional dishes served in restaurants throughout the season in Japan, and each dish has been paired to an Akashi-Tai Sake. Here are some of the special treats on offer: On April 15th, Saf are celebrating the opening of the festival and the restaurant’s first birthday with a seven course Spring-themed menu. Dishes include their signature Buddha Bowl (teriyaki glazed tofu, jasmine rice cake, wok fried greens, and kimchee); shitake mushroom soup; Japanese chickpea pancake with umeboshi plum sauce; and cherry blossom tart with rose petal and shiso reduction. The menu is priced at £60 per head or £80 with matching bespoke Akashi-Tai cocktails, including the Whisper Martini – rose infused Shochu with fresh shiso, raspberries and crème de fraise. Sushinho in Chelsea are offering a Sushinho tempura roll (5 pieces, filled with salmon, crab and cream cheese) and Sushinho Sakerinha for £13, a saving of £4. The cocktail is the restaurant’s signature tipple – a blend of Honjozo Akashi-tai sake, pink grapefruit and passionfruit. South of the river, diners at Tsuru can feast on a traditional picnic dish of smoked eel futomaki with shitake mushrooms and Japanese pickles. This will cost you £8.95 if you opt for the glass of chilled Akashi-Tai Daiginjo sake, or £9.95 with a Sakura Cocktail (Tokiwa Shochu with cherry syrup, lime juice and rosé wine). At Me Love Sushi, their set menu (£14.99) includes a sashimi platter, one salmon and avocado temaki, one uramaki duck and a Sushi Love cocktail, made with Tokiwa Shochu (a delicious Japanese spirit). On Old Compton Street, Bincho will be serving grilled sea bream – a traditional dish eaten during Hanami because the fish takes on a pink hue during the Spring months. With a measure of sake, this treat will set you back just £7.50. Finally, Saki in Smithfield has created a seven course omakase tasting menu featuring seasonal delicacies served in kaiseki style. The dishes include seared sea bass and Nanohana flower with plum sauce; cherry-leaf wrapped turbot; lobster tempura; miso black cod; and homemade cherry blossom ice-cream. The menu is available from now until mid-May, priced at £60 per head or £99.50 with fine wine and sake pairings. On April 23rd, the restaurant is hosting an Akashi-Tai Sake Tasting and Customer Shopping Day from 5:30 to 7:30pm, with 10% off selected hand-crafted items from Niigata During the festival, diners who order a Hanami menu at one of the participating restaurants will receive a Hanami card. This card gives each customer entry into a free draw with a guarantee to win prizes like Akashi-Tai mobile phone charms, Akashi-Tai Sake tasting sets and Tokiwa cocktail boxes. More information about the Cherry Blossom Festival can be found at www.akashi-tai.com/cbf

Bulldog Gin are welcoming in their very own ‘Bulldog Summer of Love’ with a series of specially commissioned aphrodisiac cocktails created by leading US mixologist Somer Perez. The partnership has resulted in a series of eight aptly titled cocktails with inspiration taken from Bulldog’s unique blend of twelve exotic botanicals, including the natural aphrodisiac Dragon Eye – an ancient Chinese remedy said to improve sexual stamina. We’re ashamed to admit that we hadn’t heard of Bulldog Gin before but it only took one look at the goth-inspired bottle, complete with spiked collar, to convince us it was worth a look. Bulldog is a London dry-style, quadruple distilled, triple filtered gin with a distinctive flavour – somewhere between fruity and citrussy, with a refreshing crispness and a smooth, balanced finish. If you’re a gin geek, you’ll be in seventh heaven with this little beauty. The recipes for the eight unique cocktails - Bulldog Gin Fizz, Berry Bulldog, From London With Love, English Breakfast, Summer Crush, British Bulldog, Puppy Love, and Raspberry Rouge – are available on their website. They will be served in some of the UK’s most exclusive bars this summer, following a launch party at erotica boutique Coco de Mer in Kensington on June 18th. If you can’t wait until then, here are three of our favourite recipes for you to try at home. From London With Love Ingredients: 1 oz Lemon Juice, 1 oz Clover Honey, 1 Egg White, 2 oz Bulldog Gin, 1.5 oz Ginger Beer. Method: In a mixing glass combine all ingredients, except for ginger beer and shake. Strain into a highball glass filled with ice and top with soda. Garnish with a twist of lemon.

Here are some of things you can get up to at this year’s show: The Real Food Market - You might be surprised and delighted at the cost and value that you will be able to find at this year's festival.

Check out the full list of exhibitors here.

Also back this year is the Sheep Show where you see Nobby the Norfolk, Susie Southdown and their friends. There will also be rare breed pigs; Daisy the Cow in a demonstration of milking and butter making; and the chickens will be on hand to help you understand the best way of keeping them.

This Spring, the beautiful countryside retreat, Loyton Lodge, is embracing the warmth of the Mediterranean with a ‘Taste of Sicily’ weekend devoted to the food, wine and flavours of this historic Italian region. From Friday 24th to Sunday 26th April, Fabrizia Lanza (owner of the renowned Anna Tasca Lanza Sicilian cookery school) will join Julian Chamberlen of Goedhuis & Co vintners at the stunning 300 acre Devonshire estate to treat guests to a memorable introduction to the best of Sicilian food and wine. The weekend will include cookery classes and demonstrations; wine tastings and master classes; informal discussions on the terroir, culture and history of Sicily; and relaxed lunches and dinners featuring the produce and wines guests will learn about throughout the weekend. Traditional Loyton Lodge activities including clay pigeon shooting are also included for those wishing to incorporate country pursuits in their weekend’s itinerary. Fabrizia will teach guests how to make pasta, foccacia bread and robust Sicilian sauces, as well as techniques like candying and preserving. She will also be offering tastings of the produce of the region including ricotta, pecorino, pistachios and almonds. Guests will create Sicilian treats to take home with them and be treated to Fabrizia’s famous Cassata Siciliana (a popular sweet from the Palermo area). Julian will share his expert knowledge of Italian and Sicilian wines. He will introduce guests to Sicily’s complex and earthy wines and distinctive Marsalas, including those from Fabrizia’s own family wine estate, Regaleali. Isobel Barnes, director of Loyton Lodge, said: “My love affair with Sicily began when I travelled to the region many years ago. Our first Taste of Sicily weekend brings together two of the most knowledgeable wine and food experts of the region. Guests can get as involved as they wish in the weekend’s activities, whether it’s foraging for the season’s first wild garlic with Fabrizia or simply booking a massage and putting their feet up to take a well earned siesta after lunch.” A delicious four-course dinner on Saturday night promises to be the highlight of the weekend. The four course menu prepared by Fabrizia will have Sicilian wines chosen by Julian to accompany each course, with a brief introduction to each one. The dinner is open by invitation to outside guests. The price of A Taste of Sicily weekend is £585 per person or £1015 per couple sharing a double room. The price includes accommodation, food, wine, tuition and clay pigeon shooting. A percentage of the profits generated from the weekend will be donated to the victims of the L'Aquila earthquake disaster. If you can’t get out of the city this month, why not try some of London’s popular Sicilian restaurants? We recommend Sardo (off Tottenham Court Road); Adesso in Richmond; Vigata in Islington; and Il Siciliano (Soho).

Snap Of The Week: Fiery Flavours At Ba Shan

If you've already seen TimeOut's glowing review of this new Soho eatery, then Ba Shan needs no introduction. If you haven't, all you really need to know is that this place is AWESOME. It's a smart addition to Romilly Street, opposite one of the team's other restaurants, Bar Shu (currently closed for a refurb). If you've eaten there before, or at sister venue Baozi Inn, then the North Eastern Chinese and Sichuan inspired menu at Ba Shan will come as no surprise. We visited early evening and took a few snaps for your benefit. Enjoy! Inside, the ground floor is a cosy minimalist space with sleek dark wood tables and simple table settings. It's intimate but not cramped - perfect for a post-work dinner date or a pre-theatre supper. We ditched the wine list in favour of these more exotic creations recommended by our waitress - a lemon ice tea and something wonderful made with fresh mango, plenty of crushed ice and a subtle floral twist.

Executive chef Stuart Gillies and head chef Simon Gregory have launched a new Sunday brunch menu at the Boxwood Café in Knightsbridge. Could there be anything more decadent than a leisurely morning feast in the Berkeley Hotel before a hard day of shopping in nearby Harrods and Harvey Nics? Available from 12 noon until 6pm every Sunday, the menu combines lighter versions of popular dishes from the à la carte menu with some classic brunch favourites like scrambled egg, smoked salmon and sourdough; omelette Arnold Bennett; and poached eggs with English muffins, spinach or bacon and hollandaise sauce. If it’s closer to lunchtime than breakfast, there are more substantial offerings like Herdwick mutton pie; grilled yellow fin tuna with parsnip puree; and the classic Boxwood steak sandwich with caramelized onions and garlic mayo. Diners with a sweet tooth should save room for dessert, especially if you have a craving for Belgian waffles with chocolate fondue or apple tart tatin with vanilla ice-cream. You can read the full menu here. There’s something to suit everyone, so why not drop a few hints to your significant other or treat your Mum to a relaxing weekend bonding session? Fancy an early morning meal elsewhere? Check out our Best For Breakfast and Brunch lists which include places like the excellent Aussie-run Lantana near Goodge Street and the eternally popular Providores & Tapa Room in Marylebone.

Afternoon Spice: Elephant Walk's New Ceylon Tea Room

***CONTENT
Run by a passionate husband and wife team, Elephant Walk has been serving quality curries to West Hampstead locals since 2005. They are one of only a handful of Sri Lankan restaurants in London and their extensive menu features classic dishes like kothu rotis, fragrant buriyanis, kiri hothi, and delicious string hoppers (rice noodles spirals) that are perfect for mopping up their spicy curries. There are South Indian inspired dishes too, like Keralan chicken and the delicious masala thosai – a savoury pancake stuffed with potatoes and onions, served with chutney and sambhar. At the beginning of 2009, the Elephant Walk team transformed the front of the restaurant into their new Ceylon Tea Room – a warm and relaxing space that looks out on to West End Lane. On a breezy Sunday, we settled in and browsed the impressive tea menu which offers everything from green to oolong, Puerh to flowering, with classics like mint and jasmine in between. “Delicate yet full-flavoured, with a hint of melon,” murmured my companion, sipping Silver Needle white tea from the smart Jing teacups. I opted for the house blend – a smooth blend of Darjeeling Pekoe and Ceylon Orange Pekoe, which is grown on the eastern slopes of the Sri Lankan mountains. The large leaves are often used in breakfast blends as the full-bodied flavour works well with milk and sugar, if you need either. (I'm no tea snob but I think you should let the sweet and earthy flavours speak for themselves). The tearoom serves traditional cream tea with scones, jam and clotted cream, as well as the full afternoon tea with dainty finger sandwiches and a glass of chilled Champagne if you’re feeling decadent. There are pancakes and thick slices of homemade cake on offer too, as well as savoury snacks like samosas, bhajis and ulundu vadai (lentil doughnuts). As we had missed lunch, we chose the vegetable and chicken curries of the day, with rice and a spinach and chickpea side dish that was so hot and delicious we were grateful for the accompanying red onion, tomato and yoghurt dip. The curries themselves were wonderfully fragrant, with the familiar scent of cinnamon and coconut reaching our noses before the plates hit the table. If there’s anywhere better to enjoy a cup of tea and escape the bustle of West Hampstead, we’re yet to find it. You don’t need to be a spicy food fan to appreciate the Ceylon Tearoom’s charms, but if you are – you won’t be disappointed! Want to discover more North London tearooms? Check out High Tea of Highgate, Yumchaa (Camden), and Chaiwalla (Hampstead). For more Sri Lankan food, try Hop & Spice (Balham), The Ceylon Tavern (Clapham), The Meeting Palace (Harrow), or Papaya (Ealing).

High Timber: South Africans Launch ‘Wine Dining’ Concept

***CONTENT
So far, 2009 has seen a lot more restaurant closures than openings, with only a handful of restaurateurs daring to launch high profile eateries in the middle of a recession. Luckily for us, one of these brave new ventures is High Timber – a ‘wine dining’ restaurant with an unbeatable location and a serious team of experts behind it. The restaurant is the brainchild of Gary and Kathy Jordan, who own the award-winning Jordan Wine Estate in South Africa, and their friend and business partner, Neleen Strauss. (If the name sounds familiar, it’s because Neleen co-founded Vivat Bacchus in 2001). “This is a natural progression for us - we make wines that should be enjoyed with great food and what better place is there to do this than in our own London restaurant, where Jordan wines will be showcased alongside the very best in the world,” said Gary Jordan. Just a short walk from the Millennium Bridge, St Paul’s Cathedral and the London Stock Exchange, High Timber is the only venue in the City with tables on the banks of the Thames. The restaurant features temperature and humidity controlled red and white cellars, where customers are welcomed to view and choose their wines from the 40,000 bottles on offer. They will range from the affordable to the priceless, and will include a range of British wines – both established names and new discoveries.

Fay Maschler and her business partner Simon Davis have announced that the inaugural London Restaurant Festival will run from Thursday 8th October to Tuesday 13th October. The six day event will be ‘a citywide celebration of eating out to acknowledge the pleasure and sustenance provided by London’s extraordinarily diverse range of restaurants’. Maschler explained, “Like all good ideas, you think, why hasn't this been done before? London is an exceptional city and restaurants play a huge part in its warp and weft. That needs to be celebrated.” Partners of the festival include big names like Visit London, Vanity Fair, the Evening Standard and toptable.com. Mayor Boris Johnson has already pledged his support and said that London’s restaurant scene is ‘a testament to the vibrancy of our city and the many communities living and eating here’. After a glamorous launch party at Quaglino's on Wednesday 7th October, the festival will run a wide range of food-themed events including: • ‘Gourmet Odysseys’ on London buses travelling from course to course;• a Vietnamese street food festival;• a Dragon’s Den open pitch where would-be restaurateurs can try their luck with industry bosses;• a food film festival (‘Eat Film’);• a University Challenge event where London chefs will compete against their New York peers;• and special festival menus in some of London’s top restaurants. The culmination will be the London Restaurant Festival Awards on Tuesday 13th October. We know October is a long way off, but make sure you put the dates in your diary now because it sounds like its going to be six days of non-stop foodie fun!

Coming Soon: The Swan & Edgar, Marylebone

***CONTENT
The team behind the popular Bourne & Hollingsworth in Fitzrovia are opening a new pub in the heart of Marylebone . Like its sister venue, The Swan & Edgar will combine a quirky interior with a first class food and drink menu. The new addition will appeal to local literati with regular poetry readings, book signings, and quizzes. The décor will centre around two unique design features – a bar made entirely out of second hand books and seating crafted from leftover tweed, which has been generously donated by fashion-conscious Londoners and Savile Row tailors. Where the Bourne & Hollingsworth concentrated on classic cocktails, The Swan & Edgar’s focus will be on fine wines, beer and ales, and spirits. Extensive and inclusive, the wine list also features a good selection of Ports, Sherries and Dessert wines, and a carefully chosen selection of fortified wines and rare spirits will be available. The venue will also host regular talks and tastings from wine and spirit experts for drinks enthusiasts. Instead of cocktails, The Swan & Edgar is introducing the notion of ‘serves’ – a classic style of drinking that has been lost in the recent trend for complicated mixology. ‘Serves’ are simple concoctions that mix two or three ingredients, adding an extra flavoursome kick to a particular spirit, but keeping it simple. Drinks falling under this category include the classic Bloody Mary, Pimms, Elderflower Spritzer and Kir Royale. The food menu will focus on hearty British dishes like Shepherd’s Pie, roasts and stews, with some of these served in larger dishes so diners can share. The menu will also feature traditional pub grub like Ploughman’s Lunches, pints of prawns, freshly cut sandwiches, and steamed puddings. At the weekend, they’ll serve up an English manor-house style breakfast buffet, to which diners can leisurely turn up and help themselves. The Swan & Edgar will be situated on Linhope Street (not far from Marylebone Station) and is set to open in early April. Watch this space!

You know best when it comes to what your Mum likes but if you need a bit of inspiration, here are ten Mum-friendly options for you to take a look at. Min Jiang – If your Mum loves Chinese food, head for Min Jiang where their exotic five-course menu is guaranteed to impress.

For dessert, save room for the sweet chilli and lychee pannacotta with pistachio crunch. If you can’t get a table on the 22nd, try for the 24th when the restaurant is hosting a five course dinner and whisky tasting with expert Roger Mallindine. Chilango – If you’re strapped for cash, head for the new Upper Street branch where your Mum can claim a free burrito! (Plus, if you work in the area, they can deliver your lunch to desk between 11am and 9:15pm – perfect if you’re working late).

When floods forced one of the West End’s most popular Spanish restaurants to close earlier this year, London’s tapas fans were heartbroken. Thankfully, Fino on Charlotte Street has now reopened and looks much the same, if a little smarter, after its refurb. Owners Sam and Eddie Hart, together with Head Chef Nieves Barragan, have used the time to adapt Fino’s menu to feature a wider variety of tapas, as well as a number of new specialty dishes. These include a soupy rice dish called Arroz Meloso and Marmitako, a fish stew made with tuna and potatoes that is popular in Nieves' home town of Bilbao. For the first time, the team has managed to source ‘Calcots' - Catalan spring onions, which will be served with Romesco sauce. As tradition dictates, the menu will change twice daily and will feature weekly seasonal specials. Regulars will be pleased to hear that they can still dine at the counter, with its view of the busy kitchen, and that the menu has retained old favourites like crispy pork belly, crab croquetas and Pyrenean milk-fed lamb. If you can’t get a reservation at Fino, why not try their sister restaurant Barrafina on Frith Street?

London Foodies Pay Over The Odds At Little Bay

***CONTENT
In February, Little Bay in Farringdon shocked London foodies and hit the headlines when they asked their customers to pay only what they thought their meal was worth. The restaurant was fully booked for the whole month and owner Peter Ilic declared the scheme a roaring success. “I’ll admit I was nervous about letting people pay whatever they liked,” he explains, “But it has restored my faith in people’s honesty. The average spend per head was higher than normal and we’ve had great feedback from a lot of new customers.” Over 10,000 customers were served in February and each paid £17.25 on average - nearly 30% higher than the restaurant’s usual average food spend of £13.50. The most paid by a diner was £40 per head and the lowest was just one penny per person, plus a £5 tip, from two students who said they wanted to prove that the promotion was genuine. “Most surprising has been the new customers we’ve attracted,” says Ilic, “I’d say over half were City workers. I guess even the big spenders are looking for a good value meal right now. I can categorically say the promotion has been a success, putting Little Bay’s fresh, good value meals on the map for a lot of new customers.” In March, Little Bay are putting the prices back on their menus but bargain hunters needn’t panic – they are still very reasonable. Starters and desserts are just £2.25 from noon until 7pm (£3.25 after), while mains are £5.25 during the day and £7.45 in the evening. One of their Aberdeen Angus burgers will set you back £5.80.

From Monday 9th to Sunday 15th March, Trishna in Marylebone is hosting their inaugural Crab Festival. The week-long celebration is a tribute to the original Trishna restaurant in Mumbai which is famous for its seafood dishes, including the signature whole crab with butter, black pepper and garlic. The London outpost will be serving a wide range of crab dishes, inspired by Indian coastal cuisine and created by head chef Ravi Deulkar, who previously worked at the Michelin-starred Rasoi Vineet Bhatia in Chelsea. He has built up an impressive network of British seafood suppliers for the occasion and will cooking Cornish brown crab, spider crab, snow crab, Norwegian king crab and blue swimmer crab throughout the week. “We’re proud to follow our Mumbai counterpart’s lead by putting crab at the heart of our menu,” explains Ravi, “We thought it would be fun to celebrate this wonderful ingredient in all its different guises with our own festival. It’s a bit of fun for our customers and it’s a brilliant culinary challenge for the kitchen. We’re going to be coming up with some amazing new dishes that may end up on the menu long term.” The special crab menu will include dishes such as shellfish rasam; blue swimmer crab and white lentil cake; and Tandoori king crab with ginger kachumber. There will be seafood-themed events throughout the week including wine tastings, a ‘crab-cracking’ class, and a competition of ‘Guess the weight of the king crab’ to win a free meal for two. If you’re not a big fan of crustacea, why not pop in on Sunday to try out their new brunch menu? Priced at £12.75, diners begin with traditional ‘Rasam’ – a South Indian soup made with yellow lentils, tamarind juice, tomatoes and pepper – and then choose an Indian-inspired main dish. The menu includes scrambled eggs with sigri smoked salmon; seafood biriyani; Goan sausage hot dogs with mustard chutney; and fresh green lentil and fennel stuffed with homemade masala paneer. A traditional drink is also included in this set price: either one of three different lassi flavours – mango, salt or roasted cumin – or a bloody Mary infused with either tamarind or horseradish. Children under six eat free so why not take your little curry lovers along too?

The sun is shining and Spring is in the air – can you feel your appetite coming out of hibernation? We can! This month, we’re feasting on pies, taking our Mums out for a well-deserved treat, and having Sunday lunch at Vinoteca. How about you? Here are some dates for your diary to keep you well-fed until April. 2nd-8th - British Pie WeekThis week foodies across the UK are celebrating the great British pie so why not head down south to a trendy gastropub like The Avalon or The Stonhouse? Along with The Abbeville and The Bolingbroke in Battersea, they’re serving up a pie and a pint for a wallet-friendly £10 this week. On the menu, you’ll find classics like cottage pie; chicken, ham and tarragon; and hearty beef and chorizo; as well as award-winning guest ales. For the brave carnivores, there’s rich rabbit pie with black pudding and prunes or cow pie with braised steak, oxtail, tongue and tripe. You can also satisfy your craving at Manze’s; Bumpkin; F. Cooke; Bluebird; G Kelly; Fox & Anchor; and Prince of Wales – to name a few! For a quick fix pie-on-the-run; try The Farm (Farringdon) or any branch of Square Pie. (We like the Selfridges branch where you can sit at the window to feast and watch the world go by.) 4th - Put Your Money Where Your Mouth Is at Waterloo BrasserieFancy attending the filming of a brand new BBC Food Show? On Wednesday 4th, Waterloo Brasserie are hosting ‘Put Your Money Where Your Mouth Is’ where celebrity chefs are being dragged back into the real world to prepare and cook for a restaurant full of paying customers. Two chefs will each offer up a starter, main and dessert and it’s up to the discerning diners to decide what they want to eat. At the end of the evening, the chef who’s made the most profit will be named the winner and all the cash will go their nominated charities.

Vivat Bacchus Hosts 'Wine & Wisdom' Quiz For Charity

***CONTENT
In March, Vivat Bacchus is launching their Wine and Wisdom Quiz which will offer teams of local City slickers the chance to indulge in a bit of healthy competition and taste some of the rarest and most exclusive wines in the world, such as Chateau d'Yquem and Chateau Lafite Rothschild. Teams will be made up of 6 members and 2 reserves from the same company and the first round will take place at the Farringdon branch on March 17th. The knock-out competition on Tuesday evenings will combine general trivia, wine themed questions and a blind taste test. Those that get knocked out in the early stages have the chance to enter the Vivat Bacchus Plate and there will be a separate pro competition for experts involved in the wine and restaurant industry. The prize for the winning team is a £600 voucher for a party or a meal at either of the Vivat Bacchus branches, while the runners-up will get a six pack of Paul Cluver wines each. The big winners, however, will be the charities. A charity chosen by the winning team will receive £2500 and the same amount will go to the two South African charities - The Paul Jungnickel Home for the Mentally Handicapped in Pretoria and the Umzi Whetu Acadamy for Aids Orphans in Port Elizabeth. The entry fee is £15 per person per round and includes a welcome drink of a glass of Paul Cluver Sauvignon Blanc. All entries will be eligible for a six pack of Ayala Brut Champagne to be drawn on the final night. On the first Monday night of March (2nd), Vivat Bacchus will be hosting a trial run at the Wine Club so that entrants can get to grips with the format. The deadline for entry is Friday 27th February so you’ve still got time to round up your most knowledgeable colleagues and sign up at http://www.vivatbacchus.co.uk/winequiz/index.asp

New Openings: Cha Cha Moon, Chilango and Recipease

***CONTENT
Following the (eventual) success of the first Cha Cha Moon that opened on Ganton Street last year, Alan Yau has opened a second branch at Whiteleys. The Bayswater shopping centre is already home to Rowley Leigh’s Café Anglais and All Star Lanes so West London foodies now have three reasons to do their bargain-hunting there. Open from February 25th, the noodle bar will serve regional Chinese dishes like Szechuan wontons, Singapore noodles, rib-eye beef lao mian, and wok-fried cod with bitter melon, black beans and glass vermicelli. The menu is divided into Soup Noodle, Cold Noodle, Wok and Sides and each dish will cost around a fiver. Everything will be cooked behind a glass kitchen wall so diners can peek in and check out Yau’s high-powered woks, state-of-the-art noodle boilers, fryers and duck driers. The restaurant itself will be a slick, modern space designed by Kengo Kuma using a mix of glass, bamboo and stainless steel. Perhaps the best news is that if you register at www.whiteleys.com before March 15th, you could win a free meal for four people (up to the value of £100 including cocktails). Do it, do it now! Across town on Upper Street, burrito joint Tortilla will soon have competition when the second branch of Chilango opens on February 28th. Like the Fleet Street original, the Islington newcomer will open in similarly flamboyant style with free burritos, live Mexican music and plenty of Corona beer. Get there early or bribe a friend to stand in the queue. If you’d rather eat in but don’t know where to start, head for Jamie Oliver’s new food store and cookshop on St John’s Road in Clapham. Recipease opens on February 26th and eliminates the shopping and chopping part of cooking so all you have to do is pop in, follow a recipe and then take what you’ve made home with you. In the ‘Easy to Learn’ sessions, you can learn knife skills or how to make classic dishes like fish pie and risotto. You can book online now – take a look at the website here. If you work in Clerkenwell, we’ve also noticed a new provenance-obsessed farm shop / take-out place on Cowcross Street in Farringdon. Farm will be using UK farm ingredients in their soups, salads, sandwiches and hot pies so if you’re looking for a chain-free lunch spot; this could be the place. For coffee and brownies first thing or mid-afternoon, head for dose – an excellent new coffee shop and café on Long Lane. Their soups and sandwiches (from the divine Bea’s of Bloomsbury) are great for lunch and anyone craving a decent Flat White won’t be disappointed.

This year, London Fashion Week is celebrating its 25th birthday from February 20th to 24th. We’re not that fussed about the catwalk shows or the designer couture, but we liked their collection of '25 classic venues to pose in the capital’. Their list includes old favourites like Nobu, Cecconi’s, Les Trois Garcons and J Sheekey, as well as some more interesting choices like The Double Club, St John and The Blue Bar. If none of those appeal, here are some other stylish dining options for the weekend. Papillon, Chelsea - Celebrity make-up artist Jemma Kidd has joined forces with Chelsea eatery Papillon to develop a menu of her favourite dishes which will be on offer throughout Fashion Week. The three-course feast is priced at £25 with £5 from every menu sold going to Children with Leukaemia. Papillon’s chef David Duverger (pictured) recently raised £6,000 for the charity by auctioning his culinary services on eBay. Jemma’s menu features pea risotto; rack of lamb with potato dauphinoise and spinach; and apple tart with vanilla ice-cream. She explains, ‘These are my dinner party staples that I rely on time and again. The secret of my rack of lamb is a drop or two of Worcestershire sauce in the gravy to give it a real depth of flavour – it’s a simple cheat, but it works.” Everyone who orders the menu will receive a Jemma Kidd Make Up School goodie bag worth over £30 to thank them for their support. Obika Mozzarella Bar, Selfridges – Fancy a quick lunch or post-shopping snack surrounded by designer labels? Head for Obika on the second floor and feast on their deliciously creamy mozzarella. It comes in four ‘strengths’, ranging from the delicate Paestum to the much stronger smoked variety, and comes with your choice of antipasti treats. Not convinced? Check out London Eater’s great review and photos. Alternatively, head for the Wonder Bar next to the food hall and share some charcuterie and a glass of something expensive.

The snow may be melting but it's still feeling frosty out there. Why not warm up in true British style with a proper cup of tea? We might be too credit-crunched to splash out on pricey hotel teas but that hasn't stopped us trying out some of London's loveliest local tearooms. We’ve plotted our favourites, using super-cute tea cup symbols, on a GoogleMap - alongside the other venues from our 'Best For Afternoon Tea' list. Have we missed your favourite? Let us know! View Larger Map High Tea Of Highgate - 'Up North' in leafy Highgate, look out for the pastel pink frontage of this wonderful shabby chic tearoom. With its retro wall illustrations, pretty crockery and unusual teacup chandelier; this place is perfect for girly catch-ups. It's run by local domestic goddess, Georgina Worthington, who bakes all of the cakes herself using organic ingredients so they're all guilt-free! Check out Silverbrow's review and the photos at TeaForJoy. Chaiwalla - Tucked away in Perrins Court in Hampstead, this exotic tearoom was inspired by the roadside chaiwallas of Calcutta and serves traditional masala chai, spiced coffee and fresh fruit juices. They offer free refills of chai when you eat in and the menu features Indian treats like samosas, chicken tikka naans and kulfi. If you're looking for an alternative to the coffee shop chains on the high street, you'll love it here. Postcard Teas - Just off New Bond Street, this place is a haven of calm. Don’t miss the wonderfully fragrant Long Jing (Chinese green tea) and the unique Coffee Blossom Tea. Cakes have always been very good and the prices are very reasonable considering the location.

Tatler Restaurant Awards Shortly after the Michelin star announcement this week, Tatler held their Restaurant Awards party at the seriously stylish Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park. The coveted ‘Restaurant of the Year’ award went to the Hart Brother’s Quo Vadis, which has had no trouble filling tables since Michael Winner dubbed it ‘the new Ivy’ in 2008. Best Newcomer went to slick City Italian, L’Anima; while Sake No Hana was named ‘The It Room’ of the year. Despite mixed reviews for his Oyster & Chop House, Mark Hix bagged ‘Restaurateur of the Year’. One of the more unusual choices was for the Best Value Set Lunch award, which went to the newly Michelin-starred Ristorante Semplice. Their 2 courses for £16 deal might be one of the cheapest around, but what about Launceston Place or Arbutus? Check out the other winners here. Gino D’Acampo at No. 5 From Thursday 29th January 2009, celeb chef Gino D’Acampo is collaborating with No. 5 Cavendish Square to create some excellent Italian menus. Gino will be hosting a once a month lunch and dinner service, with Q&A sessions and signings of his latest book, Buonissimo. The three-course dinner menu is priced at £45 per head and features classic dishes like beef carpaccio; roasted turbot with baby leeks and cherry tomatoes; calves liver with black pepper butter and sage; and lemon and mango tart. If you’d rather pop in for lunch, you’ll pay just £38 for three courses and copy of the book. Reservations are now being taken for lunch and dinner on Thursday 29th January, Thursday 26th February and Thursday 26th March, so don’t miss out!

If you haven’t already heard, the 2009 Michelin Stars were leaked on to the Internet over the weekend – much to the delight of over-eager foodies everywhere. You can read the full list here so we won’t bore you with the details, but we have updated the ‘Best For Michelin Starred’ lists on all city-eating sites to make your life easier. There were a couple of predictable (French) additions to the one-star list – namely Helene Darroze at the Connaught and Ambassade de I’Ile, which proved to be the fine dining equivalent of Marmite in 2008. The other London one-stars were Ristorante Semplice, Kai, Murano and L’Autre Pied. We were pleased to see St John finally included, though what they did differently last year (compared to the previous fourteen) is anyone’s guess. The two-star additions were also very French, with L’Atelier de Joel Robuchon and the hit-or-miss Alain Ducasse taking centre stage. That said, it was lovely to see Claude Bosi’s Hibiscus regaining the star it lost in its transition from Ludlow to London. Further afield, there were new stars for the Plumed Horse in Edinburgh; Sangster’s in Fife; Casamia in Bristol; and The Burlington in Skipton. In and around Birmingham, Purnell’s, Turner’s, Lords of the Manor, and Le Becasse all picked up their first stars. In a sad, but not unexpected, turn of events, there were five ‘deletions’ this year – 1 Lombard Street; La Noisette; Mirabelle; Tamarind; and L’Escargot. You don’t have to be a complete Michelin devotee to feel proud of London’s impressive collection of 49 stars, though it might hurt Ramsay-haters to know that he owns our only three-star establishment – Gordon Ramsay at Hospital Road. Here’s hoping that Marcus Wareing will push some boundaries in 2009 and give him some competition. Check out the full London list here and let us know what you think of this year’s additions and omissions!

Books For Cooks: Three Of The Best New Foodie Offerings

***CONTENT
Whether you’re too cold, too poor or just too busy; we know that in January you’re more likely to turn to your kitchen cupboards than to London’s newly opened eateries - however enticing they may be. Don’t forget to have a look at the special offers to see if we can save you some cash but if you’ve got your heart set on home cooking, here are three of our favourite new cookbooks to get you through the winter months. 1) ‘James Every Day: The Ultimate Collection’ - James Martin The lovable Yorkshire lad first appeared on our TV screens back in 1996, but James Martin’s no-nonsense approach to classic dishes has stopped him from becoming yet another tiresome celeb chef. In ‘James Every Day’, you’ll find new recipes as well as some favourites from his past bestsellers like ‘Eating In’ and ‘Delicious’. We love this collection because it’s well suited to cooks with limited time (and cash), who have little or no interest in fussy creations served on enormous plates. It’s a hefty tome divided into hearty chapters like ‘meat’, ‘soups’, and ‘pies, tarts and batters’. (Dessert fans will love his unashamedly calorific puddings.) Unlike other celeb cookbooks that we read like bibles but rarely use; ‘James Every Day’ is full of recipes that you’ll actually cook. There are dishes that you could knock up mid-week for the family and those that would satisfy even the most demanding dinner party guests. Some of our favourites include the pan-fried cod with vanilla shrimp butter; honeyed duck confit; lobster, mango and rocket tarts; and the dangerously decadent white chocolate, whisky and croissant butter pudding. If that all sounds like hard work, how about some chargrilled peaches with amaretto and basil? If you, or someone you know, can’t imagine Saturday mornings without ‘Saturday Kitchen’; you’ll love this book.

Since it opened in 1982, Bombay Brasserie has become of London’s most highly regarded Indian restaurants. Hundreds of regulars were heartbroken when it closed last year, despite having plenty of new-wave Indian eateries to choose from. On January 5th, BB reopened after months of extensive refurbishment and unveiled a larger, more decadent interior and an equally impressive new menu.

Burns Night In London: Have A Wee Dram In The City

***CONTENT
Every year on January 25th, Burns Night celebrates the birthday of Scotland’s most famous poet – Robert Burns. Lucky for us, Rabbie was as fond of a wee dram and a hearty feast as he was of poetry, so the festivities usually involve a lot of eating, drinking and dancing. If you can’t make it to Glasgow this month, here are some of the best Burns Night events happening in London. In Richmond, the Bingham are hosting informal whisky tastings in their stylish lounge bar. From Friday 23rd to Sunday 25th, guests can enjoy five specially chosen whisky's and Scottish themed canapés for just £30 per person. Why not stick around for dinner? The food is exquisite and the floor-to-ceiling windows in the dining room offer great views of the gardens and River Thames. Albannach have got a great night planned, complete with the traditional entrance of the haggis, poetry readings and the ceremonial carving at the high table. To celebrate the poet's 250th birthday, the festivities will take place on two nights (Saturday 24th and Sunday 25th). The night begins with bagpipes and cocktails in the lounge bar, which will be decked out in Scottish heather and tartan for the occasion. The five-course feast includes classic dishes like miniature beef and ale pie; haggis with neeps and tatties; Scotch broth; and clootie dumpling pudding. An authentic Celtic band will keep diners dancing into the small hours of the morning, while whisky enthusiasts can enjoy a dram or two from Albannach's 170-strong list. The night is priced at £85, or £125 with alcohol, and booking is essential. In the past, the Burns Night celebrations at Buchan's in Battersea have been so popular that they've chosen to spread them over two nights to make sure no one misses out. On the 24th and 25th, guests can feast on cock-a-leekie, poached Isle of May prawns; venison casserole; cranachan; and a selection of Scottish cheese and oatcakes. (It goes without saying that there's haggis too!) For something a little different, head for Moti Mahal where the chefs are dishing up an impressive whisky and Indian food pairing menu. Priced at £40, it's on offer from 23rd to 30th of January and includes a five-course dinner accompanied by five shots of whisky, which have been specially selected to enhance the flavours of each course. Dishes on offer include tandoori chicken fillet with cracked pepper and dill; roasted prawns with 'gun powder', wild boar Sorpotel with okra; and dark chocolate mousse cake. If you're not into haggis, this is the place to be. For more week-long festivities, go west and celebrate Burns Night by way of Kensal Green. At Paradise, they're introducing Scottish inspired dishes like cock-a-leekie soup; Arbroath smokie pate with Drambuie and sourdough; and roast rib of Aberdeen Angus with neeps and tatties for two to share. To wash it all down, there will be a whisky flight representing the four main regions of Scotland - The Highlands, Lowland, Islay and Speyside. Paradise has been a celeb favourite since it opened, as well as a big hit with West London's young scenesters, so dress up and grab a seat before it gets busy. Boisdale of Belgravia have a week of traditional revelry planned from January 19th to 28th, with yet more haggis, whisky and smoked salmon on offer. The nights start with a piper in full Highland regalia and there will be plenty of poetry reading too. At Babur in Forest Hill, they're celebrating with traditional khinti - the original haggis recipe all the way from Nepal. At their Burns Night Himalayan Fling on January 25th, their khinti will be piped in by a Gurkja piper and followed by a main course of raan (whole leg of lamb marinated in whisky). Actor Iain Robertson will recite 'The Address to the Haggis', while John Murtagh (Braveheart) will perform Burns' Holy Willie's Prayer after dinner. As if that wasn't enough, there will also be a whisky tasting and a raffle with a 37 year old blend of The Famous Grouse Robert Burns Edition as the prize. Tickets are £45 per person with £10 being donated to the Gurkha Welfare Trust. If none of the above appeal, Talisker whisky is hosting 500 events around the country where they’ll be giving away a free whisky glass when you buy two drams. Check out the map on their website to see if they’re coming to a pub near you.

Here are a few snaps from our trip to The France Show at Earls Court yesterday. It's open on Sunday if you fancy dropping in and, while it's mostly about French property and travel, there's plenty to keep a foodie happy too. You can try out some tasting dishes from Mon Plaisir and Cafe des Amis; try fine wines and champagnes at tutored tasting sessions; and feast on some of these Gallic treats...

New And Notable: Restaurant Openings To Look Out For In 2009

***CONTENT
There are already plenty of high-profile openings and reopenings planned for 2009, proving that even a global recession won't stop London's restaurateurs from providing shiny new places for us to gather and gorge. Believe it or not, 2009’s first big opening has already happened. On New Year's Eve, Terence Conran launched The Boundary in a converted Victorian warehouse in Shoreditch that is now home to 17 bedrooms, a rooftop bar and grill, a bakery and a smart ground floor restaurant. There are classic French and English dishes on the menu, as well as a range of crustacea, cheese, charcuterie and Sunday roasts. In nearby Spitalfields Market, John Torode's long-awaited new project - The Luxe - will open opposite Le Bouchon Breton in March. Set over two floors, it will feature a lively café bar and a first floor dining room specialising in game and poultry. Bjorn van der Horst - former chef-patron of Gordon Ramsay's La Noisette - will open his own restaurant in Clerkenwell. Located on St John Street, Eastside Inn will be a traditional Gallic brasserie serving up classic dishes like soup a l'oignon; tartare of beef; braised Limousin veal sweetbreads and eel a la Bordelaise. Nick Ward (ex-Petrus) will be Head Chef, while Parisian Fabrice Hequet (ex-La Noisette) will be the restaurant manager and sommelier. While the menu will be anchored in French tradition, the cuisine will also feature Spanish, Dutch and American influences from Bjorn's childhood. Richard Caring of Caprice Holdings plans to open three restaurants just a stones throw from his established gems, The Ivy and J Sheekey. The new eateries will be part of the £60million Longmartin development, which will provide a traffic-free haven of shops, offices and achingly desirable apartments in St Martin's Courtyard.

After all the Christmas feasts and New Year's Eve blow-outs, your bank balance might be looking a bit sad this month but that doesn't mean you can't treat yourself to a slap-up meal or two. Set lunches have always been a good way of eating well without over-spending, but London's restaurants really upped their game in 2008 and started serving some seriously impressive midday menus. We've compiled 20 of the best deals (with our favourites highlighted in italics) and we haven't listed anything over £35 per head, which is why Le Gavroche's infamous 3 courses for £48 lunch deal is missing. Admittedly once you've added on wine and service, none of these places are really 'cheap' but their set lunch deals are still the best way to try them out before committing to the a la carte. 1) Launceston Place (Kensington). The damage: 3 courses for £18. Sample dishes: Spider crab risotto with garlic butter; venison casserole with parsnip mash; Cornish cream tea pudding. Further reading: Launceston Place was very popular with London's food bloggers in 2008, so check out the great reviews and photos from Tamarind & Thyme and London Eater to get an idea of what to expect. For us, this was definitely the best lunch deal of the year and we hope it continues to impress in 2009. 2) L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon (Soho). The damage: 2 courses for £19, 3 courses for £25. 3) Arbutus (Soho). The damage: 3 courses for £15.50. Sample dishes: Slow-cooked venison in red wine with gnocchi and pecorino; traditional bouillabaisse (Marseille style); bavette of Scottish beef with caramelised salsify and dauphinois potatoes. 4) Marcus Wareing (Knightsbridge). The damage: 3 courses for £35. 5) Galvin Bistrot de Luxe (Baker Street). The damage: 3 course prix fixe £15.50. Further reading: This place beat Le Gavroche and L’Atelier and won French Restaurant of the Year at the London Restaurant Awards. Thring For Your Supper praised ‘its commitment to delicious, unrarefied French cooking’ and noted that ‘while undoubtedly De Luxe, it remains unquestionably a bistro’ – and that, dear foodies, is why we love it.

Happy New Year! – Our Foodie Highlights Of 2008

***CONTENT
Yes, we’re a day late but in our defence, it was a very good party. Happy New Year from all of us here at city-eating – we hope you celebrated in style with fellow foodies. 2008 was a good year for food, especially in London where there were more new openings and relaunches than you could count. We hope you found our New Openings page helpful and that you’ll keep an eye on it throughout 2009 and let us know if we’ve missed anything. In the same way, if you’ve searched for your local favourite and it’s not listed or you know somewhere has closed, please get in touch – we rely on your insider knowledge to keep us up to date. 2008 was the year of the blog on city-eating. Not only did we start our own, but we also started to link to amateur restaurant reviews as well as those from professional critics. We asked some of our favourite food bloggers to share their best experiences of London dining with us and here’s what came back: • Our food blog newcomer of the year has to be London Eater who has approached blogging with incredible enthusiasm and taken some great photos along the way. His full round-up of the year is well worth a read and it ends with a recommendation for crab on toast at Great Queen Street. “It's not pricy, simple, premium British ingredients and tastes really great. For a great restaurant for today's times – fine food on a shoe string – you can't go wrong at Wild Honey. For spot-on food and for that special occasion: Hibiscus.” • Another newcomer we uncovered is Thring for your Supper - a dashing young gourmet who shared his best meal of the year with us. “Although it's a tough call, my best London meal in 2008 was probably at St. John. The restaurant has its critics, who say that the various spin-offs (Magdalen, Great Queen Street, and the rest) have taken the mantle and pushed it further than Henderson, but we enjoyed beautiful plates of simple, perfectly executed food. It doesn't have a Michelin star, or a chef whose gurning face is always on the telly, but it continues to produce exquisite and honest dishes with a profound belief in heritage and seasonality.” Well said, Sir!

Hi guys - thank you so much for this mention!! I'm always happy when people pat me on the back, gives me even more reason to go out there and eat more - and write more audaciously about it too!

All the best and have a grand start to 2009!

Excellent round-up.

I'm green with jealousy that I wasn't mentioned, though!

Brasserie Roux Heathrow: An Unexpected Delight

***CONTENT
Linked to Terminal 5 by a sleek walkway, the Heathrow Sofitel's marble maze of bars, boutiques and luxury bedrooms wouldn't look out of place in Mayfair. It's only fair, then, that it's got a suitably stylish restaurant to match. Overseen by Albert himself, Brasserie Roux is a smart but unpretentious space with grey banquette seating, plush plum-coloured fabrics and an impressive water feature designed by David Harber. Diners can sit under clever pagoda-like structures, which shield them from the prying eyes of hotel guests in the rooms above, and the space is so well sound-proofed that you can only tell you're in an airport if you look out of the window. Under the watchful gaze of manager Thierry de Magneval, the staff provide refreshingly attentive but understated service. We were left to enjoy each course in peace but were never left waiting for our glasses to be topped up or our questions to be answered. Our waiter, for example, was only too happy to list the herbs in the vinaigrette that accompanied one of our starters - a warm leek salad served with a perfectly poached egg and crisp croutons. Proof, if it were needed, that the most enjoyable dishes are those where the flavours are allowed to speak for themselves.

Fast Food Fragrance: Burger King Launches 'Whopper' Body Spray

Over at The Feedbag, one of our favourite NYC gastro-blogs, Josh Ozersky has stumbled upon possibly the best Secret Santa present ever. For the man who has everything…Burger King Body Spray! Now available to buy online and in the US, Flame promises the ‘scent of seduction with a hint of flame-broiled meat’ which sounds pretty good - unless you’re trying to make a move on a vegan. This latest stunt follows the hilariously bad taste ‘Whopper Virgins’ ad campaign, which saw Burger King offering a Whopper to the last few people on earth who had never eaten a hamburger. They hired Stacy Peralta, a director better known for making movies about skateboarders, and sent him abroad to give Greenland Inuits, Hmong tribesmen in Thailand, and Transylvanian peasants their first taste of global commercialism. The body spray is less controversial, but we're still not sure if anyone is going to pay $3.99 to smell like their favourite food. (Couldn't you just roll around in Whopper wrappers instead?) Lets just hope the other fast food chains don't want to get in on the act - Big Mac lipgloss would be a step too far.

Next week, dining room tables across the UK and beyond will be groaning under the weight of traditional Christmas fare. Deliciously crisp roast potatoes, tender brussel sprouts, parsnips, cranberry sauce, pints of gravy, and lest we forget – the driest, least flavoursome bird that money can buy. We admit that if you pack it full of stuffing and wrap it in bacon, you might actually get it to taste like something but does anyone really want it? If you'd rather not spent Christmas morning up to your elbows in gizzards or plucking out stubborn feathers with your Mum's tweezers, here are ten of the best alternative Christmas menus on offer in London this year. There's a cuisine and price to suit everyone and not a turkey in sight! 1) One of our favourites - The Establishment in Parsons Green - is serving up a great British Christmas menu until December 23rd. At lunchtime, it's priced at £25 for 3 courses which is a bargain for the top quality dishes we've come to expect here. Fulham foodies can start with spiced parsnip soup or seared scallops with crispy pork, and then feast on hearty mains like braised Galloway beef shin and roast breast of wild pheasant. Their puddings have had us in raptures on more than one occasion, so we recommend saving room for egg nog crème brulee or chocolate fondant before heading to the bar for cocktails. 2) Vegetarians facing the prospect of yet another nut roast might want to head for Saf instead, where there's a much more appealing menu on offer. Chef Chad Sarno cooks many of his dishes below 48°C to preserve optimal flavour and nutrition, so you won't find any of the usual Christmas stodge here. The tasting menus, ranging from two to five courses, feature delicious dishes that are 100% free from animal products, dairy and processed ingredients. Vegan gourmets and raw food enthusiasts can feast on chestnut crepes with wild mushroom and walnut stuffing; beetroot ravioli; and sweet pumpkin pie with espresso syrup - all washed down with a glass of biodynamic wine, recommended by Saf's sommelier, Joe McCanta. For guilt-free dining, this Shoreditch gem is hard to beat. 3) While a yuletide trip to Paris would be ideal, a trip to Alain Ducasse at The Dorchester is certainly the next best thing. The restaurant itself is a neutral space in understated shades of beige but we like to think that's to help the Michelin-starred food take centre stage. The £285 Christmas menu features decadent dishes like duck foie gras and chestnut ravioli; crab with truffled minestrone; seared scallops; and roasted 'Jaune des Landes' capon breast with seasonal vegetables. It's a bit of a budget buster but who cares? Tis the season after all...

Snap Of The Week: Rossopomodoro’s Got The X-Factor

Rossopomodoro, Italy’s leading Neopolitan pizza chain, have immortalised the X-Factor judges in pizza dough to mark the show’s final on Saturday 13th December. The chain now has three restaurants in London – based in Notting Hill, Chelsea and Covent Garden – and the inspiration for these incredible pizzas came from managing director Simone Falco, who is a huge fan of the show. Simone says, “I'm originally from Naples and we have our own version of the show in Italy but in this case, Britain's is best. I absolutely love the X-factor, so my tribute to the programme was to task the team at Rossopomodoro to make the pizzas – I think the resemblance to the judges is uncanny!” Since the finalists were announced, Simone has been selling pizzas named after the three X-Factor finalists, and keeping a tally of who is the public's favourite choice. Diners can nibble on the Eoghan Quigg Corbarella – a simple but delicious mix of mozzarella, mushrooms, ham, cream and fresh basil, or go for the Alexandra Burke Massese with tomato and spicy salami. If you’re a JLS fan, you can feast on a traditional four-cheese pizza topped with Neapolitan cheeses. All of the X-Factor pizzas are available at the bargain price of £9.00 and you can book a table at the Notting Hill branch on their london-eating page.

To celebrate the opening of The Real Greek’s new restaurant in Spitalfields Market, local City folk were treated to donkey rides to and from their offices. The chain supports the animal welfare charity, Corfu Donkey Rescue, and found that Londoners were equally enthusiastic about their unique alternative to taxis. Managing Director Liz Williams said: “We’ve had a tremendous response to our special service. It might take a little longer but it’s certainly a relaxing and green way to get to your destination and the city workers aren’t afraid of making an ass of themselves – it’s just a bit of fun!” Like its sister restaurants, the Spitalfields branch is a relaxed and informal eatery serving up authentic Greek food. The menu features traditional mezedes, which are perfect for sharing, and their infamous souvlaki - chargrilled kebabs wrapped in flatbread and served with tzatziki and tomato relish. If you don’t work in the City, don’t worry – you can sample some of The Real Greek’s great food at their other branches in Hoxton, Clerkenwell, Bankside, Putney, Marylebone, Covent Garden and the Westfield Shopping Centre.

So, December has arrived in all its arctic glory and we’re finally ready to admit that Christmas is coming. We know that most shops have had their decorations up since mid-August and some people have already got their presents wrapped and their turkey in their freezer, but if - like us - you’re taking a more laid-back approach to the holiday season, here are some of the best places in London to do your festive food shopping. - From 20th to 23rd December, the Southbank Centre will host the Slow Food Christmas Market - the ideal place to stock up on sustainably produced fresh food for an eco-friendly larder. This year there are over 25 stalls selling things like Sheepdrove Farm's organic turkeys; Perry Court bio-dynamic vegetables; rare breed pork; game pies; Somerset cider brandy; and Ping Pong's flowering teas. - There are still tickets available for Gordon Ramsay’s Taste of Christmas, which runs from December 4th to 7th at ExCel in Docklands. There will be plenty of cookery demos, wine tastings, sample dishes from top London restaurants, and a huge range of stalls selling unique gifts and seasonal food and drink. Some of our favourites will be there, so look out for The Garlic Farm, Kellys Turkeys, the Japanese Knife Company, and Daisy’s Dog Deli - the only place to buy treats for your pampered pooch this Christmas. - There’s Christmas music at Borough Market from 4th December, and BBC3’s Choir of the Year are performing on Saturday 6th. As usual, you can pick up quality cuts of meat, excellent cheese, fine wine and plenty of chocolate and fudge - just go bright and early to avoid the crowds. Check out the seasonal opening hours on their website. - The Moet & Chandon Pop Up Shop is open throughout December on New Bond Street and it’s the perfect place to pick up a bottle of festive fizz. If you have guests to impress, parties to attend or just fancy treating yourself; you can’t go wrong here. Prices start at £50 for a 75cl bottle and there are 1500cl Nebuchadnezzar bottles available if you want to bathe in the stuff. To add a little extra sparkle to a gift, get the Moet maestros to customise your bottle with a name or date in Swarovski crystals. The shop is open from 11am to 7pm and you can call 0845 871 1743 for more details.

Circus Eats: Great Food At Bargain Prices In Stratford

Stratford like other previously unloved bits of London, is being regenerated. It’s all to do with the Olympics in 2012, I suppose, and it’s going rather well. Smart blocks of flats are already filling up with City slickers who can commute to Liverpool Street in 15 minutes on a good day, and the bones of another Westfield shopping centre are already in place. (Though why it’s not going to be called Eastfield is unclear.) A short walk from the station is the ‘cultural quarter’; home to the Picture House, the Theatre Royal and Stratford Circus - a youth-focused performing arts centre, which is where we were headed on a chilly Tuesday evening. On the ground floor, effectively in the foyer, is the centre’s café bar - Circus Eats - which promises good wholesome food at affordable prices. “Call me cynical,” said my companion, “but in London, cheap food is usually bad food.” Well, luckily for us and the locals, that certainly isn’t the case here. The weekly changing menu is concise and clearly aimed at East London’s multicultural masses, with international dishes like Polish stew and West African jollof rice and jerk chicken thighs on offer. There are ‘light bites’ available until 6pm, as well as their popular interpretation of school lunch - a bargain at £4.50 for two courses. We began with pea soup and prawns with a fresh and flavoursome salsa. The prawns, sourced from nearby Billingsgate Market, were deliciously plump, juicy and a big hit with my friend, who left only a neat stack of shells. My soup, vividly green in colour and drizzled with truffle oil, was well seasoned and tasted genuinely nourishing. Served with a chunk of rustic bread, it was an honest warming winter dish - though I’d have liked it passed through a sieve to get rid of those pesky pea skins.

This Thursday; families, friends and food fans across the USA will sit down together to give thanks and feast on traditional treats like roast turkey and pumpkin pie. Why not join in the fun? Whether you’re an ex-pat or just looking for an excuse to chow down, here are our top three places to celebrate Thanksgiving in London. 1) The Albemarle, tucked away inside the seriously stylish Brown’s Hotel, is offering a full Thanksgiving menu priced at £45. It begins with pumpkin soup and a cinnamon muffin, followed by roast Holy Farm turkey with creamed sweetcorn, caramelised sweet potato and cranberry sauce. Make sure you save room for dessert – sinfully sweet pecan and bourbon pie with clotted cream. 2) City slickers can give thanks at Missouri Angel near Tower Hill, which serves the best of American cuisine all year round. Their menu is priced at £35 and begins with a choice of roast parsnip soup, Louisiana shrimp, or classic Waldorf salad. For mains, there’s roast turkey, blackened rib-eye steak, or sea bass – all served with seasonal veg. Pumpkin pie, pecan maple tart or chocolate fondant should round things off nicely. 3) For an American feast with an Italian twist, try Tentazioni - a favourite with London Bridge locals. Their £36 menu includes dishes like pumpkin ravioli with butter and sage, roast turkey with cornbread stuffing, and pumpkin pie with vanilla ice-cream. If none of the above appeal, there are Thanksgiving menus available at Smollensky’s on the Strand, Harvey Nichol’s Fifth Floor Restaurant, Bodean’s, and Eagle Bar Diner. Just think, with all that turkey on offer – it’s like a dry run for Christmas Day. Elasticated waistbands here we come!

1) From Friday to Sunday, the Barbican Centre is hosting the French Wine Grower’s Fair, where 130 wine-growers from will showcase over 500 new wines. All of the French wine-producing regions will be represented, as well as British wine-growers based in France. For just £10 per ticket (if you print the voucher from the website); you can meet the wine-growers, sample an unlimited amount of wine and purchase your new favourites at producer prices. Perfect for stocking the cellar for a credit crunch Christmas! 2) From November 21st, you can kick start your festive spirit at the Cologne Christmas Market at the Southbank Centre. Open from 10am to 10pm, it’s a great place to pick up some unusual gifts or treat the kids to a carousel ride and a visit to Santa’s Grotto. Parents can relax with a glass of Glühwein (German mulled wine) and enjoy seasonal specialties like bratwurst, gingerbread, roasted almonds, delicious crepes and Kölsch (Cologne beer). 3) It’s your last chance to sample the Rajasthani menu at Mela’s Covent Garden and Herne Hill branches. To celebrate Diwali, the festival of light, the Chefs are serving up dishes like venison nizami kebab; jhinga jaipuri (jumbo prawns with chilli, coriander and saffron); and lal mass, a spicy lamb curry in a blend of spices, onions and tomatoes. If you’re short on cash, you can drop in for lunch when they’re offering a reasonably priced set menu of three courses for £17.50. 4) The excellent Somerset House ice-rink is now open but if you’re not into frozen fingers and falling over, you can always head for the Skate Café and Bar instead. Here you can feast on daily changing soups, pies and hot dogs; or just warm up with a glass of mulled wine or an apple toddy. We recommend the sinfully rich hot chocolate with marshmallows, whipped cream and a cheeky shot. 5) Why not try out a new restaurant? There have been lots of notable openings recently, including some high profile gems like Corrigan’s Mayfair, The Hat and Tun, Trishna, Indali Lounge, and Cinnamon Kitchen. We’ve also been hearing good things about Inamo – the restaurant with computer screen tables that allow you to order, pick a tablecloth design and play Battleship. Yes, it is a bit of a gimmick but they’re serving up some seriously tasty pan-Asian food so it’s definitely worth a try!

From November 24th, the Eagle Bar Diner is taking burger fans on a trip around the world with a different internationally inspired burger each day and a matching cocktail created by mixologist Simon Delbosc. The week kicks off with Chef Philip Hunter's tribute to the West Indies - a spicy Jamaican Jerk Chicken burger, washed down with a Calypso Caribbean martini. On Tuesday, they're crossing the Atlantic for a Moroccan lamb and apricot burger, and an exotic Souk Martini made from camomile vodka and mint tea syrup; while Wednesday's visit is to Europe for a Hungarian pork burger with smoked paprika and apple. On Thursday it's back to the USA – birthplace of the diner - to celebrate Thanksgiving. Try the 6oz prime beer burger flamed with Woodford Reserve and topped with Monterey cheese, followed by an Apple Martini - a classic blend of bourbon, maple syrup, mint and apple. It's back to Britain on Friday for a Lincolnshire game burger with watercress and forest fruit compote, accompanied by the intriguingly named Tweed Martini. Finally, head east for the weekend with a red chilli, yoghurt and coriander Bangkok Burger and a Thai delight cocktail of vodka, lychee and coconut cream. Even the most hardcore burger connoisseur will struggle to eat all six, so why not pick your favourite and drag some friends along for a patty party? We recommend sticking around in the bar after dinner for one of their infamous $10 shakes. It’s classic vanilla with a big ol’ slug of bourbon – delicious and deceptively lethal!

After a long and arduous journey, we’re finally here - blogging live from the BBC Good Food Show 2008. It’s incredibly busy and we’re having some trouble wading through the coach-loads of ravenous senior citizens and GCSE domestic science students, but we’ve already done a full sweep of the mezzanine level - which is cooler, less crowded and full of great British produce. Here’s some of the highlights from our early morning tastings: - Two glasses of rose champagne from the Moet & Chandon bar - a wonderful way to start the day, but not cheap at £9.95 per (plastic) flute. - Dips and marinades from DW Dips - these are tasty powders that you can rub into meat, mix with oil for an easy marinade, or add to stir-frys. The Garlic & Herb mixed into a dip is a far cry from anything you’ll get in a supermarket and the spicier Middle Eastern options will be great for barbecues. - Unpasteurised, cellar-matured Winterdale Shaw - an incredibly smooth hard cheese from Kent. Made just miles from London, this is local produce at it’s best. - Mature cheddar from Somerset, also unpasteurised - a strong flavour but without the unpleasant harshness of factory-made alternatives. Highly recommended - look out for the lovely lady at Keen’s Cheddar. - Easy to use Asian sauce pouches from Passage Foods - not synthetic at all and perfect for lazy mid-week dinners. Don’t miss out on the butter chicken simmer sauce or the tom yum pouch. At £1 each, they’re a bargain! - There’s plenty of chocolate about but our favourite so far is the organic stuff from Cocoa Loco. Bag a brownie and some of their white chocolate with chilli before it's all gone! Also highly recommended is the award-winning Angel Chocolates from the Yorkshire Dales - we’ve just bagged some of their unbelievably creamy milk chocolate slabs. - Finally, Anila’s Authentic Indian Sauces. It’s a family business serving up some seriously spicy curry sauces, but the Goan option is a milder option packed full of green herbs to give it a light but bold flavour. Appetites suitably whet, we’re off to the Restaurant Experience to see what London’s top restaurants have to offer. Back soon!

It may feel like London is just counting the days until Christmas, but there’s still plenty of time to have some fun in November. The Betjeman Arms will be marking the new St Pancras Station’s first birthday with a weekend-long ale festival from November 6th to 8th. The gastropub will be paying special attention to drinks that can still arrive at the Betjeman by rail – including a whole range of ciders and traditional ales, alongside their usual menu of pub grub favourites. On November 21st, 12 Temple Place is hosting an elegant evening of dinner and dancing, starting at 7pm with a champagne reception. The four-course menu includes spiced pumpkin soup; roast scallop with black pudding mash; beef wellington with glazed potato, roasted salsify and sautéed wild mushrooms; and Earl Grey Tea chocolate fondant. The vegetarian menu features Union beer and butternut casserole, and semolina dumplings with mushrooms, mizuna and sorrel. Tickets are priced at £89 per person and the dress code is black tie, so it’s a great opportunity to give your festive finery a trial run before the party season gets into full swing. To celebrate St. Andrew’s Day, London’s favourite Scottish restaurant – Albannach – is hosting a highland fling on the 29th. A bagpiper will herald guests’ arrival and all guests wearing a kilt will receive a complimentary bottle of the Albannach Whisky Beer and be entered into a best kilt competition, with a chance to win dinner for two. The evening will begin with a reception in the lounge bar, adorned with Scottish heather and tartans for the occasion, and the menu for the evening is a five-course feast that showcases the best produce from north of the border. It includes terrine of Highland rabbit; traditional haggis with neeps and tatties; and loin of highland venison with thyme potato cake and parsnip puree. Dessert will take the form of decadent miniatures and lovers of a wee dram can indulge their passion with a tasting menu of whiskies specially selected to match each course. The party will continue with traditional dancing and music from ceilidh band, The Longnotes, and a midnight toast to St. Andrew. Tickets are priced at £50 per person or £85 with matched whiskies. If none of those take your fancy, why not head to your nearest YO! Sushi and take advantage of the ‘eat ten plates, get five free’ offer? Or try out the new white truffle dishes at Alloro? You can even enjoy authentic Rajasthani dishes at Mela, or something more traditional like the game menu at Bentley’s. Talk about being spoilt for choice!

Opening on November 1st, FLASH is set up in the West Room of the The Royal Academy of Art and will be a fully-functioning restaurant for 80 days before closing. It is part of an exciting new arts season called GSK Contemporary which includes 20 art exhibitions, 40 live events and 100 film screenings. FLASH is brought to you by the guys from East London eatery, Bistrotheque, who enjoyed huge success with the first temporary restaurant, Reindeer, back in 2006. Executive Chef Tom Collins has created the lunch and dinner menus, which are inspired by French and Californian cuisine. It includes dishes like dressed Dorset crab with grapefruit, avocado and spinach; grilled duck breast with seared foie gras, confit duck, cabbage and cherry jam; and orange pannacotta with blood orange sorbet and polenta tuile. The afternoon interlude will be filled by the Josiah Cream Tea which celebrates Wedgwood china’s 250th anniversary in traditional English style. There is a suitably stylish wine list on offer too, but we recommend trying out the signature cocktails. Don’t miss the Royal FLASH – a blend of Ketel One vodka, crème de cassis, champagne and fresh berries. Tables are already extremely hard to come by, so cross your fingers and make your bookings fast. Their online booking system is located here or you can give them a call on 020 8880 6111.

It is a shame that FLASH shines for such a short season. It delivers pleasure by design. My review will be published next week.

Incidentally, I was so intrigued by this restaurant that I invited a chap from Channel 4 to lunch there. You can see a film of the literally 'cool' kitchens here:

The £1.6billion Westfield shopping centre opens its doors today after months of hype and speculation. Thousands of Londoners are expected to visit over the next few days to splash some cash in the 265 shops inside. With 16 brands never seen before in the UK alongside big names like Dior, Tiffany & Co, Mulberry and Ted Baker; West London’s fashion-conscious locals will be spoilt for choice. But it’s the promise of ’50 international food concepts’ we’re really interested in. There are 17 restaurants and cafes on the Southern Terrace and 13 more on the Balcony, while the Loft near the cinema is home to three family-friendly eateries – Nando’s, Pizza Express, and burger-joint Byron. On the Terrace, you’ll find the second branch of popular pizzeria Fire & Stone; Swiss vegetarian café concept, tibits; and Wahaca – the second Mexican street food restaurant from BBC Masterchef winner Thomasina Miers. Chains like Gourmet Burger Kitchen, Wagamama, Del Aziz and The Real Greek are also represented. The Balcony, overlooking the bustling Atrium, is a more informal space with communal seating, home to familiar favourites like Square Pie; Pho; Tiffinbites; YO! Sushi; and a new dim sum and noodle hut called Bamboo Basket. There’s food from all over the world with France represented by Crepeaffaire and Croque Gascon (from the owners of the Michelin-starred Club Gascon in EC1), which will be serving up traditional cassoulet and duck burgers with optional foie gras. Hungry shoppers can also enjoy risotto at Ooze Risotteria; sandwiches and other snacks at Café Concerto; and Middle Eastern cuisine at Comptoir Libanais. The problem here won’t be finding something you like, but being overwhelmed by choice! It’s going to be an incredibly busy place for the next few months but don’t panic, we’ve got you covered. Fire & Stone and The Real Greek are now bookable on london-eating so you don’t have to worry about queuing for a table, and the rest of the centre’s eateries are all on site and ready to receive your reviews – good or bad.

We know it’s technically for kids, but that won’t be stopping us from getting in on the action this Halloween - especially when there’s so many great events to choose from. London’s top Thai restaurant, Mango Tree, will be revealing its dark side with a sinister Sunday full of fun for the whole family. From 2:30pm, there will be face-painting, pumpkin carving, and prizes for the best costumes; but after 7pm guests can look forward to devilishly adult fun and a medley of twisted tunes performed by Cabaret from the Crypt. A special three-course menu is available until November 2nd, including dishes like spiced prawn and crayfish salad, guinea fowl jungle curry with aubergine; and red fruit set in red wine jelly – all for just £29.50. If you’re in the mood for a seriously spooky meal, then head for Tootsies in Richmond where they’ll be serving up a tasty python curry to adventurous diners. If you’ve already tried alligator, ostrich and kangaroo; then why not add this non-venomous but still scarily enormous snake to your culinary ‘To Do’ list? The curry is available until November 27th but don’t panic, the kids can still tuck into the normal Tootsies Junior menu. Your little terrors are also welcome at Chicago Rib Shack where they’ll be invited to wear their best costumes, play ghoulish games and take part in trick or treat. There’s a special menu too, featuring American favourites like pumpkin chowder, 10oz rib eye scream steak, and Frankenstein’s apple pie with cinnamon cream. For a slightly more grown-up All Hallows’ Eve, try out the Halloween Supper at No. 5 Cavendish Square near Oxford Circus. Their elegant menu includes pumpkin soup; baked cod with porcini mushrooms and butternut squash; and devilishly dark chocolate mousse. Across town, trendy arts emporium - the ICA - is celebrating in style with frightening films and a full-on costume party which kicks off at 8pm in the ICA Café & Bar. Head The kitchen will be serving up classic British dishes like fish and chips and organic burgers, while the bar has put together a Halloween-themed cocktail list. Don’t miss the Skelitini – a bone-chilling blend of bourbon, chambord and fresh blackberries. The hosts will be giving away a bottle of Champagne to the guest with the coolest costume. The party in the bar is free to attend, while cinema tickets are priced at around £8 for non-members.

Pumpkins Galore: Waterloo Brasserie’s Seasonal Feast

While most of us have only ever used them for jack-o-lanterns at Halloween, the humble pumpkin has a lot more to offer – that is, if you’re brave enough to carve them. The autumnal favourite is loaded with beta-carotene – (known to reduce the risk of cancer and heart disease) - and they’re also packed full of vitamin C, potassium and fibre, which are all wonderfully good for you. But that’s enough science. We’re happy to eat them for eating’s sake and, luckily for us, Waterloo Brasserie is saving London’s busy gourmets the hassle of carving their own by serving up a four-course pumpkin menu for one week only. We visited yesterday on a suitably chilly October evening and settled into the darkly stylish main restaurant, which is actually an ideal setting for a night so close to Halloween thanks to its sleek dark furniture, moody lighting, and canvases splashed with warm shades of red and orange. Naturally, I went for the full pumpkin menu which begins with a traditional soup. Served piping hot in a hollowed-out half pumpkin; it was well-seasoned and had a much deeper, earthier flavour than the roasted butternut squash soup I had made just days before. The bijou portion was just enough to set the mood and between the two of us we mopped up every last drop with the excellent poppy seed bread. From the special Autumn drinks list, I chose the Thanksgiving cocktail – a blend of Tanquerary gin, Martini (extra dry), apricot brandy, and lemon juice that cleverly cut through the rich pumpkin flavours. Next came a delicious square of puréed pumpkin lasagne, packed with fresh wild mushrooms and topped with a pine nut velouté. Full of flavour and not too heavy or rich, this was a vegetarian’s dream and a welcome change from the tomato-based original. So far so good. My dining companion, who had so far waited patiently while I worked my way through two courses, was rewarded with a perfectly cooked bavette steak and pommes dauphinoise. My third course was, sadly, less successful. While the risotto itself was well cooked and accompanied by a delicately flavoursome sage cream, the bitesize chunks of pumpkin suffered from being slightly undercooked. A real shame, as this was otherwise an excellent dish. We rounded off the evening by sharing the almond nougat ice-cream. Firm, as opposed to creamy, in texture; it was studded with chunks of chewy nougat and drizzled with a subtly sweet pumpkin coulis. Light and not unlike frozen yoghurt, it was a suitably satisfying end to our seasonal feast. The Pumpkin Menu is available all week (ending on October 31st) and is priced at £25 for four courses. If you’re not in the mood of a full-on feast, you can also order the dishes individually to complement your choices from the a la carte.

It seems like ages since we were sipping Pimms and shopping for goodies at the Taste Festivals this summer, so it’s comforting to know that there’s less than a month to go until BBC Good Food Show London kicks off on November 14th. Now in its sixth year, the show will feature the usual winning combination of celebrity chefs, award-winning producers, book signings, wine and beer tastings, and sample-sized dishes from some of London’s top restaurants. This year’s special guests are Nigella Lawson and Heston Blumenthal who will be hosting the Food Icons sessions as part of the Cookery Experience alongside James Martin, John Torode and Theo Randall. The Restaurant Experience will be returning, offering food fans the chance to sample dishes from Blue Elephant, Roast, La Porte Des Indes, Theo Randall, Smiths of Smithfield, Kai Mayfair, Sumosan and many more. The gallery level of the Grand Hall Olympia will be transformed into a huge farmers’ market to create The Producers Village which this year plays host to the Slow Food Pavilion, and Henrietta Green’s FoodLovers Fair. As well as the London show, the BBC Good Food Show will be in Glasgow from 31st October 31st to November 2nd and at the NEC in Birmingham from November 26th to 30th. Tickets for all of the BBC Good Food Shows are on sale now from the box office (0870 040 0324) and online at www.londonbbcgoodfoodshow.com. We will be blogging live from the London show on Friday 14th, so if you’ve got weekend tickets be sure to check the blog before you go to see what we recommend.

Taking the biscuit!

Nigella Lawsons theatre show at the good food festival in Kensington Olympia was a little deflating to say the least.

With the sound of James Martin over the wall cooking until the very last minute, even running over time I was so excited to see what Nigella had to offer.

Instead she puts a few ingredients in a food processor, cuts out a star from the mix and in true blue peter style here's one I made earlier brings out a ready made star to decorate and hang on the christmas tree.

On to the question and answer session for about 30 mins, I had one question on my mind

Is it too late to ask for a refund?

With temperatures dropping and winter drawing in, it’s time to roll out the comfort food and from October 13th, Britain will be indulging in its favourite - chocolate. This year Chocolate Week is focusing on British chocolate and celebrating it with talks, tastings, demos, and the opportunity to meet British chocolatiers like Gerard Coleman, Marc Demarquette, Pascal Beschlé, and William Curley. Some of London’s top restaurants are getting in on the act too. Diners can enjoy exclusive chocolate desserts at Signor Zilli, The Alma, Acorn House, Sam’s Brasserie, and Harrison’s. Some of London’s Gaucho Grills will be serving up ‘Chocolate Tres Leches’, which is head chef Martin Manning’s take on a traditional South American dessert made from cocoa, cream, evaporated milk, condensed milk, butter, eggs, sugar and flour. If you’re on a diet, just remember: there are no calories in food someone else pays for, so get someone to treat you. Hardcore chocoholics should head for Almeida in Islington, which will be offering a full chocolate-themed menu including dishes like butternut squash veloute with a chocolate and cumin stirrer and pot roast squab pigeon with Madeira and chocolate jus. If you like your chocolate in its original liquid form, there are sinfully sweet cocktails on offer at the Sanderson’s Long Bar and chocolate-themed afternoon tea, complete with chocolate martinis, at the Mandeville Hotel. You can pair chocolate with tea at Tea Smith, whisky at Paul A’s chocolate shop in Camden, cognac at Fortnum & Mason, and fine wines at Bumpkin - so whatever your favourite tipple is, you can be sure there’s a truffle to match. As if that wasn’t enough, there’s also free tastings at chocolate shops across London, chocolate classes at L’Atelier de Chefs, and the launch of 100% pure Mexican chocolate bars at Cocomaya. You can check out the full itinerary on the Chocolate Week website and print special codes and vouchers for your cocoa fix of choice.

Diners at the Rossopomodo pizzerias can look forward to being refused cutlery and encourage to get stuck in, Neapolitan style. The chain - which has branches in Covent Garden, Chelsea and Notting Hill - was originally founded in Naples and is passionate about staying true to its Italian roots. Even the water they use to make their coffee comes from Naples. \"We make traditional Neapolitan pizza, and anyone from Naples will tell you, you don't eat pizza with a knife and fork. It's crazy using cutlery,\" said Rossopomodoro's managing director Simone Falco. \"Pizza is something you touch and share. The pleasure of eating it is just as much about how it feels as how it tastes.\" Simone and his team are enforcing the no cutlery rule, and will confiscate any knives and forks brought in by customers so fall in line and get hands on. Bring the kids - they'll love it!

New research from leading burger restaurant chain, GBK, has revealed that the vast majority of students starting university this Autumn can't cook simple meals from scratch. They surveyed 300 18-21 year olds across the UK and discovered that 66% couldn't cook an omelette, while one in six couldn't put together a traditional roast. While 88% could manage to prepare beans on toast, only 23% could make fresh soup and many relied heavily on pre-prepared food. David Sykes, Managing Director at GBK, explained: \"While I expected a lot of young people were used to having their food cooked for them, I was surprised by how few were able to cook pretty basic meals.\" \"To make sure students are getting proper, wholesome food into them, we're offering a special 'you buy one, we'll buy one' deal on all of our burgers when they produce our exclusive student voucher. I'd challenge even the hungriest of students to polish off two of our filling burgers, even if one of them is free, so bring a mate!\" The offer is valid for students only, Sunday - Thursday, when you eat at any Gourmet Burger Kitchen in the UK. Just buy two burgers and the cheapest one will be free. Offer runs until 31st October 2008 and you can print your voucher from the GBK site or the STA Travel site.

Chilango, which means a person living in Mexico City, is a new Mexican restaurant arriving in London with a mission to deliver fast, fresh and tasty Mexican food to the masses. Owners Eric Partaker and Dan Houghton have spent two years researching the best burrito and taco to come up with the most popular formula (taking into account traditional Mexican versions as well as US versions in California etc). They explain: ‘Our name sums us up. We’re here to bring some vibrant Latin spirit to the streets of London.” Set to launch this October on Fleet Street, the interior will be a mix of bold, modern colours and the menu will feature typical Mexican fast food with a twist. Everything will be prepared and cooked fresh daily in the open kitchen, with chicken marinated overnight in their secret marinade and the guacamole mashed by hand. Most importantly, it’s all on offer at bargain prices – which should go down well as we all tighten our belts and the media talk us into a recession. If you can’t wait for Chilango’s doors to open, you could try the equally cheap new addition to Goodge Street – Benito’s Hat. The menu is small – just soups, salads, burrito and tacos – but they do these very well indeed. They have already had a rave review in the Metro and our users have reported ‘great tasting beef, salsa verde and guac’ and, predictably, long queues. Not so new but still worth visiting are Mucho Mas on Upper Street, which serves up ‘simply delicious burritos’ and ‘organic juices’ and nearby Tortilla – famous for its authentic street food. KL explains, ‘Tortilla a tiny, fast-food-esque place directly across from Angel, and specializes in the simple, inexpensive Mexican food that I came to know and love back in the States...I had the lush grilled steak burrito with everything, doused with Cholula hot sauce at the table. I may have to swing by for the braised pork on my way home.’ If you’re lucky enough to live or work near Leather Lane, you probably already know about Daddy Donkey. If you don’t, head down for lunch mid-week and grab a burrito to go. They’re among the best you’ll find in London, and their tacos are pretty good too.

The Talbot Inn, Ripley has just reopened after a massive Merchant Inns Ltd. refit that has seen this 15th Century inn keep all its original charm of low, head-splitting, beams and cosy inglenook fires but now also benefit from very modern facilities. The 400 year old oak main staircase looks like it’s been in quite a few wars and it’s odd to think that Admiral Nelson, who frequently stayed here en route to Portsmouth, must have run his hand where you now run yours. When he wasn’t running his hand over Emma that is. A new restaurant with a cool copper ceiling and carved from an adjoining building blends classical and modern décor with a shiny conservatory while the menu is modern and assured from Chef Ian Richards. Upstairs in the original building are stunning, romantic bedrooms while out back are tasteful new rooms in a purpose built building that blends in with the original structure well. A pub and restaurant for locals and a hotel that’s ideal for corporates in the week and couples at the weekend, The Talbot is a warm place to go this autumn and just a short ride out of London. With RHS Wisley next door, you can combine a trip with some shopping for tasteful Xmas gifts too. Kiss me Hardy!

This Autumn, award-winning chef Theo Randall has teamed up with Pizza Express and created four new pizzas for the season’s menu. Having worked at the River Cafe before opening his own restaurant at the Intercontinental Hotel in Mayfair, Theo is famous for his passion for quality ingredients. The new pizzas use the original Pizza Express dough recipe, but add new ingredients like fresh uncooked mozzarella, Fontal cheese from Trentino, and the same brown shrimps he uses in his own restaurant. The shrimps are accompanied by grated zucchini, creme fraiche, grand padano, lemon and chilli on Theo’s Gamberettini pizza. For veggies, there’s the Piemontese – yellow and red peppers with garlic, red onions and nutty Fontal cheese – and tuna fans can feast on the Tonnara – yellowfin tuna, olives, anchovies, garlic and capers. We popped into the Farringdon branch yesterday and tried out Theo’s Favorita. The crisp oval base arrived topped with with hand-torn fior di latte mozzarella, translucent layers of parma ham, nicoise olives and plenty of rocket. The cheese isn’t melted so it feels a lot lighter than the usual Pizza Express offerings, and with all the rocket you could almost pretend it’s healthy. Served on platters with pizza cutters and priced between £8.25 and £10.95, they’re probably more expensive than your usual order but we reckon they’re worth every penny.

Compleat Joy For Marlow

People in Marlow must be fed up with being told their home is the new Ludlow. It’s probably rather confusing for the postman too. The comparison is made because there are so many fine restaurants in this bijou little town just forty minutes or so from London: The Oak Room in Danesfield House, The Hand & Flowers, The Vanilla Pod and opening now, Aubergine at the Compleat Angler housed in a historic 400 year old building. William Drabble has been head chef of the London Aubergine for ten years and is now Executive Chef of both restaurants and on this party night he is out mingling in his whites, while back in the large kitchen his lads and lasses are turning out canapés like there’s no tomorrow. And from the amount of champagne we are all drinking there may well be no tomorrow, at least not one that’s free of paracetemol. The large figure of Tom Kerridge - owner and chef of local legend The Hand & Flowers, together with his wife Beth who does so much to make their restaurant so welcoming - is here cheerfully consuming the quality nibbles, his giant hands making them look like kid’s treats. He’s affable and very complimentary about William and also about Adam Simmonds, Head Chef up the road at the Oak Room. He seems genuinely pleased that with Aubergine, another fine restaurant, is opening and sees it as being good for the area. Other chefs are in the room, including Laurent Michel from L’Oranger, another part of the London Fine Dining Group, and with him are his ebullient Maitre d’ Eric and their patisserie chef. It’s a ‘compleat’ works outing for them. Local people seem well heeled and perhaps slightly older than you might expect, but exactly the sort of reliable, regular, diner the restaurant is no doubt looking for. As the one-man band lurches into another timeless Tony Bennet classic, we pop outside for a fag and to admire the restaurant’s gorgeous location next to the Thames and Marlow’s lovely old bridge. William’s menu promises great things and it’s arguable that the country is where affordable good food will be found as London rates, and a reduction in consumer spending power, start to bite. The Aubergine should make leaving London for a weekend break more attractive than ever

La Tasca Opens At Old Spitalfields

***CONTENT
Following a multi-million pound refurbishment, Old Spitalfields Market looks...almost finished, with shiny new restaurants filling the spaces in the illuminated glass cubes that overlook the market. Horner Square – so new even GoogleMaps can’t find it – is already home to a Gourmet Burger Kitchen, Las Iguanas, Canteen and other fast and friendly eateries guaranteed to keep the local City boys well fed all year round. Self-proclaimed ‘mega-brasserie’, Le Bouchon Breton, opens this week and John Torode’s new venture, The Luxe, is set to follow in 2009. The newest addition, though, is a branch of Spanish super-chain La Tasca. We popped in last night to check it out and – as you’d expect – it’s full of Spanish flags, bright colours and paintings of bulls and matadors, but it looks rather good. We had barely sat down to browse the menus before a smiling waitress brought over glasses of fruity sangria. It was delicious, and that’s coming from someone who doesn’t usually touch the stuff – even in Madrid. With hungry journos and gangs of PR people spilling through the doors, the staff were like a well-oiled machine, ferrying bread baskets and bitesize morsels of Spanish omelette from table to table. Normally at this sort of thing you have to wrestle the canape wench to the floor and prise any freebies out of her fingers, but not so at La Tasca. We watched, open-mouthed and ravenous, as enormous pans of paella were carried aloft to the front of the restaurant and generous portions were spooned on to waiting plates. There were different types – one with chicken and chorizo, one with mussels and plump prawns – and they were all delicious; hot, fragrant and eagerly washed down with the jugs of sangria that arrived at each table. It’s a rarity to see a smile on a waiter’s face these days, so the full-on grins at La Tasca were a nice surprise. If standards stay this high, we’ll be back to try out the tapas. It certainly beats queueing in the rain for Barrafina!

Andaman Opens As Banks Close

***CONTENT
There used to be, perhaps still is, a band called Yello made up of two Swiss gentlemen called Dieter Meier and Boris Blank. When I heard that Dieter was now a 3 star Michelin Chef and heading up the kitchen at Andaman at the revamped St James Hotel I was all overcome with excitement. I visualised a restaurant throbbing to the sound of electronica as the chef robot-danced around the ovens. Imagine then my disappointment to find that the chef is actually Dieter Muller and nothing to do with the band at all. The disappointment is leavened on this opening party night by the sight of the chef himself inside a glass box kitchen in the restaurant efficiently turning out small dishes for the crowd with ruthless, accurate, proficiency. These are not canapés, they are too grand for that and there’s not a cocktail stick in sight. Although Chef Muller spends some part of each month at his restaurant in Germany, he is very much at the controls tonight and while the brigade wear white, he has a steely-grey top on which, together with his air of concentration, easily marks him out as a man in charge. The place is packed. A lot of people have been invited and a lot of people have come to see just how good Dieter might be. Initial reviews have been a bit cool but the jury is not in as these are early days and at least one of the critics hates ‘posh’ food as a matter of principle. Certainly it’s a bit easy to dislike foam, which is now passé in anyone’s book but here it didn’t detract from a nicely cooked scallop resting on a bed of cous cous whose granular texture matched the scallop’s smoothness very well. And there was more to come..

Wine Matching At Benares

***CONTENT
Wine writers eh? What a life. Here we are at Benares, the Michelin-starred Indian restaurant in Mayfair sampling nine courses by Head Chef Atul Kochnar matched with nine wines. The wine writers are discussing best Business Class supplier for long haul and comparing notes on the best place to sit, just like commuters working out where the train doors open on the 08:15 Ongar to London. My small contribution about Ryanair causes a pause in the conversation, a look, and then they carry on as before. A bit of a ‘I’ll get my coat’ moment. Ah well, I may not get to travel the world on a regular basis but I am here at least ready to face the challenge of eating on an epic scale. Except Atul assures us the dishes will be small, bonsai versions, identical in every way to the full dish, just miniaturised and so it proves. Of course Indian restaurants have tried to convince us of the possibility of wine with Indian food before. Their reason isn’t entirely down to enjoyment. The cynical fact is that restaurants make a lot of money on wine mark-up and not a lot on beer. The more high-end restaurants can lure us out of the clutches of Cobra and into the embrace of a Chardonnay, the more moolah they can make. To do so does require a sommelier of some vision and persistence though, and Costanzo Scala is that man. An Italian working in an Indian restaurant, he tells me that he has chosen all the wines to go with tonight’s dishes after long hours pondering in the cellar. One thing he has tried to do especially is to use wines he already had, rather than search out new ones. And so after a few words of welcome from Costanzo the tasting and tippling begins. For anyone looking to try the pairings read on for the night’s menu

Tierra Brindisa - London’s tapas fans no longer have to trek to Borough Market for their fix, as the team behind the infamous Tapas Brindisa have opened Tierra Brindisa in Soho. The menu includes some great cheese boards and a comprehensive Spanish wine list, as well as familiar favourites like Padron peppers and Iberian ham. Unlike the original, you can book tables here so queueing is a thing of the past. No reviews yet so get yourselves down there and start scribbling!Min Jiang - With its location on the tenth floor of Kensington’s Royal Garden Hotel, Min Jiang boasts a great view and a sophisticated Chinese menu featuring their signature Bejing duck dish, served as three separate but equally delicious courses. Our users say that ‘the food is stunning and just as good as the Singapore restaurant’ and there are good reports on the bar and service too. It's 'a bit pricey' but it sounds like it's worth a visit.Buddha Bar - Despite having conquered Paris and Dubai, Buddha Bar is failing to impress london-eating’s users. Diners have complained that although ‘the place looks amazing’, the pan-Asian menu ‘wasn’t very inventive’ and the staff were ‘rude’. It’s still early days though so Buddha Bar has time to iron out the creases and up their game.We’ve also been busy adding local gems recommended by our users. Here are some of the best:Richard Phillips at Chapel Down in Kent - \"I was amazed at how smoothly everything was running the staff was friendly and attentive and the food was exquisite. Something that came as a pleasant surprise was the size of the portions. Often with fine dining I have left a restaurant - though pleased with the taste, aroma and presentation - feeling hungry. Surely the point of any dining experience is to be served excellent food in the right quantity and I was very pleased to say that the portions at Richard Phillips are generous.\"L’Esperance in Surbiton - “L'Esperance is my favourite restaurant in the Surbiton area, both for visits as a couple and with the entire family. The menu is a mixture of standard and slightly more adventurous French dishes. The food is consistently well cooked and nicely presented and lives up to the management's claim always to use fresh ingredients. Recommended for pretty much any occasion.”If we’re missing your local favourite, let us know. Send us an email via the Contact Us page, here
