Just got word in our inbox of yet another European-style brunch party being thrown in the city this summer with pitcher service of brunch cocktails...but these guys have their own line of prosecco -- nice: Via dei Mille, the authentic Italian restaurant and lounge located on West Broadway in Soho, hosts a weekly European Brunch Party every Sunday. The all day event features live DJ's, great food, and brunch cocktails by the pitcher where guests dine, drink and dance the afternoon away. Restaurateurs Barry Mullineaux and Giuseppe Tuosto have crafted an elegant and enticing menu with options including Eggs Florentine, poached eggs & spinach with hollandaise sauce ($12); Caprese Panini, fresh bufala mozzarella, basil leaves and garden tomatoes with a basil-pesto spread ($16); Tuna Tartar in a lemon, tomato, basil, scallion and extra virgin olive oil dressing ($14); and Tagliolini Pasta with manila clams and diced tomato in a light white wine sauce. Their new line of prosecco, Via dei Mille Prosecco Extra Dry, can be enjoyed in many of the fresh fruit champagne cocktails that are freshly muddled to order and available by the pitcher. Via dei Mille is located at 357 West Broadway between Broome and Grande.

Know Before You Go: No Pool For You at The Gansevoort's \"Get up Get Down\" Rooftop Pool Parties This Summer

***CONTENT
We read the read the official press release on Cityfile and also received an email this morning from China Grill Management about the new Get Up Get Down Rooftop Pool Parties on Saturdays and Sundays all summer long at the Gansevoort Hotel in the Meatpacking District. The Gansevoort press release describes the concept: Create a vacation destination right on our doorsteps, catering to those who still want the summer experience in the city. With European guest DJ’s, signature tropical drinks, bottle service, a brunch menu and of course the fantastic pool, Get Up Get Down will be the first event of its kind in the city – an upscale rooftop brunch and pool party. Bringing the sexy St. Tropez feel to New York City every weekend. Sounds great, right? I checked out the Get Up Get Down website for more details. The site opens with a nice little flash video with dj music, lots of pictures of the Gansevoort Hotel pool and even images with scrolling text reading \"Get Wet.\" The website says that the roofdeck party goes to 8pm every Sat and Sun beginning May 30th with brunch service starting at 12pm. I still needed more deets so I called up the brunch reservations number. I spoke to a very nice woman who informed me that the Get Up Get Down Rooftop Pool Party does not include pool access and that the party is limited to the bar area and outdoor area attached to Plunge -- the rooftop bar. She informed me that the pool and pool deck is reserved exclusively for hotel guests. I also asked about the brunch service and was informed that brunch runs from 12-4pm, at which time all the tables turn into VIP tables reserved for bottle-service only. If all this is true, it means China Grill Management is promoting its so-called \"St. Tropez style weekend brunch & rooftop pool party\" with some mighty deceptive and misleading PR and website info. Doesn't look like you will be \"getting wet\" as the website promo promises or lounging poolside in your bathing suit sipping a mojito. We're looking into this further and will let you know what we are able to find out from CGM.

this is such a scam. Pool opens to those at the party around 4pm, at which time you will need to satisfy a table minimum to participate.

when i called to ask about it, they told me you have to partake in bottle service, aka spend hundreds of $$, to get access to the pool, and then you only get it after 4pm like Jeff said.

What the F: Chick-Fil-A Snubs NYC, Announces Debut of a Chicago Location

***CONTENT
What do we have to do to get a Chick-Fil-A here in Manhattan? And don't tell me that the location in the food court of NYU's Weinstein Center counts. If you thought this week's debut of Baja Fresh was big news, can you imagine the hype that would ensue if Chick-Fil-A announced plans to open locations here? Apparently, New Yorkers are going to have to wait at least another year to get their Chick-Fil-A fix without flying south. Crain's Chicago reported here yesterday that Chick-Fil-A is currently exploring sites for its first Chicago location. Apparently, Chick-Fil-A only opens about 70 new locations a year. Chick-Fil-A is undoubtedly well-aware of the demand for NYC locations. A simple Google search shows the high level of support. Click here, here, here and here. I sent Chick-Fil-A an email inquiry earlier this year about an NYC location and got the following response from a Chick-Fil-A Cares representative. All they could tell me is that New York is \"on their radar screen.\" From: Chick-fil-A CARES To: Freedman, Andy Dear Mr. Freedman: Thank you for taking the time to contact Chick-fil-A. You are very important to us, and we appreciate knowing that New York residents are interested in Chick-fil-A. Currently, there are no definite plans to develop additional Chick-fil-A Restaurants in New York. The one location you mentioned is a licensee location at New York University (New York University, Weinstein Food Court, 5-11 University Place, New York, NY 10003; 212-995-3057). Chick-fil-A opens approximately 70 new Restaurants each year. We receive literally hundreds of requests from customers regarding possible locations at or near which they would like to see a Chick-fil-A Restaurant. Although we appreciate our customers’ input, our Chick-fil-A Restaurant new opening locations are determined internally through our own market research after thoughtful analysis. Please rest assured, however, that New York is on our radar, and we will forward your request to the appropriate parties within Chick-fil-A. We also appreciate your interest in franchising a Chick-fil-A. Our Franchisee Opportunity program is designed for individuals who desire to personally operate their own business but may lack the large capital outlay. A Chick-fil-A Operator/Franchisee manages the restaurant on a day-to-day basis and may not have any other active business venture other than the restaurant. Again, thank you for your time and interest in Chick-fil-A. Sincerely, Tamara Chick-fil-A CARES SHARETHIS.addEntry({ title: \"What the F: Chick-Fil-A Snubs NYC, Announces Debut of a Chicago Location\", url: \"http://www.winedanddined.com/2009/05/what-the-f-chick-fil-a-snubs-nyc-announces-debut-of-a-chicago-location/\" });

Citrine Lounge (59 W. 21st St. in the former Snitch space) is launching a new happy hour party called PRE. Every Tuesday through Friday from 5-11pm they will have a special happy hour cocktail and food menu. To celebrate PRE's launch, Citrine will be offering a free open bar tomorrow, May 28th, from 6-8pm. Citrine's food menu, which is available daily from 5-10pm, has been specially designed by Belgian neighbor Markt, and features traditional fare like Belgian frites with fresh mayonnaise ($6) and Green salad with goat cheese on croutons, honey and toasted pine nuts ($11), as well as dishes such as Tuna tartare with sesame seaweed salad, fresh lemon juice, wasabi and soy sauce ($14) and thinly sliced smoked duck breast with fresh greens and a truffle vinaigrette ($14). The new cocktail menu is specially designed by co-owner Adam Elzer and features an array of summer libations made with fresh ingredients and adapted from traditional family recipes, like the Berry Blossom ($7), made with Blueberry Vodka, St Germain, cranberry juice, and soda with a cherry garnish, and the Strawberry Nirvana ($8) a blend of Strawberry mix, Stoli Vanilla Vodka, and Champagne.

Finally someone other than Sunburnt Cow (unlimited Foster's w/ AYCD brunch) has stepped it up and is offering an AYCD beer brunch. Both Village Pourhouse locations (1 uptown near Columbia Univ and 1 in E. Village) are featuring all-day brunch parties this summer, with BBQ, bottomless beer, bacon and booze. There are even 2 separate menus: one offered from 11am-2pm and another from 2-5pm. The AM Beer Brunch features VP's French toast menu, flavored cereal milks and assorted breakfast entrees. The AM Brunch includes a two-hour all-you-can-drink Bud and Bud Light special. The PM Beer Brunch is an all-out backyard BBQ and includes hot dogs and hamburgers with different sides and condiments BBQ selections will include The Blitz - crispy bacon cheddar and BBQ sauce burger, and The Ballpark - a chili and cheddar hotdog). The PM Brunch includes two-hour all-you-can-drink Bud, Bud Light and Sagativa Lemonade Pitchers and Brunch Punch specials. Village Pourhouse Downtown: $25 for an entree and all you can drink special. Village Pourhouse Uptown: $20 for an entree and all you can drink special. Now, we're lookin' for someone to take the AYCD Beer Brunch to the next level by offering craft beers, or at least something better than Bud and Bud Light.

NYC & Company, the same folks who bring you NYC's celebrated Restaurant WeekYear, has been offering a great 'between Restaurant Weeks\" deal we didn't even know about -- a complimentary glass of wine or dessert with the order of any entree at more than 45 restaurants.

Burgers continue to be the talk of the town here in NYC with Pat LaFrieda and Black Label becoming household names. Over the past several months more and more bars and restaurants have been offering a burger and beer special. Irving Mill has a great Monday night deal that includes a different Sixpoint beer and cocktail each month. The Town Tavern is rockin' what it is calling The Great American Burger & Brew Challenge everday between 11am-6pm -- you get a 1/2lb cheeseburger deluxe + a 16oz Bud Light draft for $10 and if you finish the burger they'll throw in another Bud Light on the house. Now we get word that Bar Blanc Bistro has joined the fray with a Sunday night burger and beer deal where $15 gets you a burger, fries and a draft beer. And don't forget about BBB's other great deal-Mon-Fri from 5:30-7pm all wines by the glass, beers, cocktails and bar snacks are 50% off. Lookin' for more burger + beer deals. Check out here.

If you haven't already done so, then it may be time to get your 'Groupon.' The online deal-a-day coupon service is offering up a great one today -- pay $20 and get $50 worth of food and drinks at The Orchard. 260 of these coupons, excuse me 'groupons', have already been purchased today. Click here to get yours. You can buy as many as you want, but can only use 1 per table per visit. My recommendation -- go on a Sunday night when The Orchard is BYO. You may just get in for under $50 total -- which would make that a $20 meal for 2 with wine. Now that's recessionally special.

The list of street-food vendors using Twitter compiled and published by Serious Eats earlier this week is a great resource. We looked for a similar list of all New York restaurants and bars and unbelievably couldn't find one. Based on our hunting and pecking around on Twitter and the Internet, we have compiled the rather exhaustive (but likely still missing many) list of New York restaurants and bars on Twitter. If you know of others, please leave them in the comments. It seems that many of New York's dining and drinking establishments still aren't paying nearly as much attention to the Twitterverse as they should be. Maybe this run down of who is doing what will get them to tweet because we just hate being out of the loop for even a minute on what our favorite places are up to. While you're checking some of these out, don't forget to follow us @winedanddined UPDATE: Thanks to Grub Street for providing several NYC restaurants on Twitter that we had not yet uncovered. 675 Bar: @675Bar Frequent tweets on drink specials, events, who's pouring, what's pouring and more. Academia di Vino: @academiadivino Starting to get into a daily routine of tweeting specials of the day and special deals like this tweet: Monday Nights we offer our entire 900 bottle list at 50% off! A great time to try something you haven't tried before. See you tonight! Agozar Restaurant: @AgozarBistro Updates on food and drink specials. Ayza Chocolate & Wine Bar: @AyzaWineBarNYC Tweets have been few and far between and have mainly consisted of asking people to write-in a Zagat vote. Blanche's at DKNY: @BlanchesatDKNY Using tweets to get the message out about their menu and daily specials, and, in particular, that they are only place in Midtown serving Stumptown Coffee. Blue Fin: @bluefinnyc As with the other BR Guest restaurants, great use of tweets. Some interactive tweets asking for follower feedback on specials and ideas for specials, some informative tweets about daily menu features, info about cooking events and more. Blue Water Grill: @bluewatergrill As with the other BR Guest restaurants, great use of tweets. Some interactive tweets asking for follower feedback on specials and ideas for specials, some informative about daily menu features, info about chef cook-offs and more. Bobo: @boborestaurant Appears to be still figuring out Twitter identity. Random smattering of fairly useless information so far. Brooklyn Bowl: @brooklynbowl Tweets each day with a new \"under construction\" pic of the progress, esoteric New York bowling facts, upcoming events and more. Centro Vinoteca: @CentroVinoteca Appear to be fresh to the Twitterverse. Hopefully more tweets coming soon. Certe: @Certe Frequent updates on daily specials. Sample tweet: Don't forget our Afternoon-Pick-Me-Up $5 Coffee Drink and Dessert in our dining room Chop't: @Chopt Can't quite figure out what the h they're tweeting about. Citrine Lounge: @CitrineNYC Just getting underway on Twitter. The City Bakery: @citybakery A tweet every few days or so with ways to get freebies and other related info.

Crif Dogs: @CrifDogs Only tweets once every couple of weeks. Destination Bar (opening soon at Avenue A and 13th): @DestinationBar Tweets on progress of the construction with pics and info. Also great photos on their website depicting the construction phase from the beginning. Dos Caminos: @DosCaminos As with the other BR Guest restaurants, great use of tweets. Some interactive tweets asking for follower feedback on specials and ideas for specials, some informative about daily menu features, info about cooking events and more. Eammon's Pub: @EamonnsBar Occasional Tweets on drink and dinner specials. Fatty Crab: @FattyCrab Haven't been any tweets since April, but they were tweeting specials and Twitter-only freebies. Sample tweet: First 50 people at Fatty before 1:30 who tell the barkeep to, \"Kiss their Nasi\", get a free PBR and barsnacks. Still bumpin, come on in!!! Goodburger: @mygoodburger Frequent tweets on promos (like $2 off milkshake) and specials. Sample tweet: Hey guys, skip the frappuccino today and refresh with a goodburger milkshake. Today 3-5pm get $2.00 OFF any milkshake at any location! Grotta Azzurra: @GrottaAzzurra Just one tweet. That's all it took. Havana Restaurant: @HavanaNY Only a few tweets, but perhaps more to come. Heartland Brewery: @HeartlandBrew Tweets fairly infrequent. One about celebs who visit HB, one about specials at HB burger. Hopefully more on the way.

Patsy's Italian Restaurant (not related to Patsy's Pizza): @patsysnyc Tweets on food and drink specials, pics of what's going on at restaurant and what the managers are up to. PDT: @PDTNYC I guess it's Please Do Tell, or at least as far as there new drinks and new menu items go. The Pony Bar: @ThePonyBar Awesome use of tweets. Every time a new keg goes into the rotation, there's a tweet to let people know what it is. Sample tweet: Now batting, for The Pony Bar, Left Hand 400lb Monkey IPA.

All you have to do is print out a coupon, or what they're calling a 'meal ticket', and bring it with you to the restaurant. Some of the offers are better than others. Here are the ones we find compelling and a link to the coupon: Free gin and jam cocktail at Madam Geneva with purchase of any menu item or cocktail. Print this out and bring it with you. Complimentary wine flight (for up to two people) prepared by the sommelier at The Monday Room with purchase of one menu item or drink. Here's your ticket.

My Own Benjamin Burger Challenge: Benjamin vs. Michael Jordan

Something just didn't sit right with me after my Benjamin Burger Challenge experience last week, and it wasn't the Benjamin Burger. It was more the gimmicky nature of the so-called \"challenge\" and all the factors that tilted the playing field to the Benjamin's advantage, i.e. the other burgers had significant travel time, the Benjamin knew they were preparing their burger specifically for the \"challenge\" (leading you to wonder how the hell they overcooked the Feedbag's burger), the idea that it was all organized by the Benjamin PR team (should mention here that two of the three delivery burgers weren't close to medium-rare), and the question of whether pitting a steakhouse burger against high-end diner/fast-food burgers is fair. But then again if I had ignored the pleas of the Benjamin PR folks altogether, I may not have discovered what turned out to be a very well-conceived, well-constructed and well-crafted burger. I also discovered something even more critical -- the only way to truly compare burgers is to do so in a side-by-side tasting format. There are just too many variables to do it any other way. The real takeaway though was that the Benjamin Burger is a really damn good burger. But I couldn't stop there. I needed to find out for myself if it's consistently good and how it stacks up against another steakhouse burger. I needed a challenger. I had been hearing for quite some time that the Michael Jordan Steakhouse burger is a force to be reckoned with among steakhouse burgers. For whatever reason though, the MJ burger, like several other NYC burgers including the Molly's Pub burger, has flown way under the radar on the NYC burger scene. It made for an ideal contender, especially since Michael Jordan's Steakhouse is located in Grand Central Station just a block or so away from the Benjamin Steakhouse. I called up each of the steakhouses and placed an order for a medium-rare burger. I jumped in a cab and less than 30 minutes later, I was back at my office with both burgers. I have to say that the folks at the Benjamin did seem quite surprised to see me picking up a burger just a day after I had been there for the \"challenge.\" I told them I had a bit more investigative research to do. The goal -- to find out who has the 'Best Underrated Midtown Steakhouse Burger Near Grand Central': THE TALE OF THE TAPE Burger Blend The Benjamin: 100% USDA Prime Beef -- New York Strip, Rib Eye, Filet Michael Jordan's: Approx. 10% USDA Prime Beef -- Chuck and Top Round (80-20 blend, choice grade) + trimmed prime scraps from leftover prime Strip Loin cuttings Meat Purveyor The Benjamin: Strassburger Meats (Carlstadt, NJ) Michael Jordan's: West Conn Meat (Bronx, NY) for ground beef / Buckhead Beef (Atlanta, GA) for prime meat Preparation/Seasoning The Benjamin: Dry-aged for 28 days in dry-aging box / Seasoned only w/ kosher salt Michael Jordan's: Not dry-aged / Seasoned w/ kosher salt and fresh ground black pepper Cost The Benjamin: 1/2lb burger w/ fries = $15.95 **Also Includes Choice of \"Silent Options\": jalapenos mixed into the meat, sautéed mushrooms, sautéed onions, onion rings, bacon, thinly-sliced Canadian bacon, diced peppers (mixed with the meat), sautéed peppers, cheese, minced bacon (mixed with the meat) Michael Jordan's: 1/2lb burger w/ fries = $15.00 and 3/4lb burger w/ fries = $17.00 THE TASTING I again enlisted my friend Mark's assistance to help in judging the two burgers. Now, each of the burgers had about equal travel time and though not ideal, it made for a fairly level playing field. We halved the burgers and began tasting and comparing. The first thing I noticed was that the Jordan's burger had a lot more seasoning in the meat than the Benjamin burger. If it's just kosher salt and fresh ground pepper they season with, then there was certainly quite a bit of it, though not necessarily a negative. You could even see the seasoning encrusted in the cheese atop the burger. Check out the seasoning on the center of the burger in this pic. The second thing that was apparent was the Benjamin burger was cooked a perfect medium rare (though before cutting I have to say it didn't look so pretty). The Jordan's burger on the other hand was a tad overcooked and came in at closer to a medium than medium rare. You can see the difference in the pic below. After a couple of bites of each, it was way too difficult for me to determine which was the better burger. They both had unreal flavor and perfect burger-bun ratios. The Jordan's egg-kaiser bun was slightly sweet with a challah-like flavor while the Benjamin bun was a fairly standard old-school sesame seed. Mark and I both agreed that the Jordan's burger had the better bun. After a couple more back-to-back bites of each burger, I could tell that Mark had already made his decision. I was still struggling. Even though it was cooked a bit past my liking, this Jordan's burger was a flavor-bomb that was proving to be one helluva juicy and delicious burger. It had a nice external char and intense flavor. Like the first Benjamin burger we tried, this Benjamin was just as tender and loaded with a distinctive flavor of dry aging. Again the wonderful taste of this exquisitely-crafted, high-quality grind left me repeating aloud, \"damn, this is a good burger.\" It was even better prepared than the one the day before that had the home-field advantage. THE VERDICT After about my 7th bite of each burger, I finally looked over at Mark and said \"Benjamin\" and he nodded. But damn was it close. We both thought that if the Jordan's burger had been cooked properly and as perfectly as the Benjamin's, it may have been a dead heat. I still think the Benjamin would have eeked it out on account of the flavor of the meat, but it would have been very close. One takeaway is that the Jordan burger had almost as much delicious tender, juicy and rich flavor, despite no dry-aging of the meat. Next up for the Benjamin -- Wolfgang's Burger.

Here's a look at our dining and drinking picks for today in NYC: Head to Pranna (Madison b/t 28th and 29th) this evening, where they're celebrating World Cocktail Day in a major way. It's basically AYCD for 5 hours ($60) with specialty cocktails from 19 renowned mixologists, including Audrey Saunders, Dale deGroff, Allen Katz, J. In addition, there will be some finger foods from Pranna's kitchen to help soak up the alcohol. Waldy Malouf has been offering some terrific recession deals at his midtown restaurant Beacon (the 60-day Stimulus Plan includes 20% off a la carte menu items and 30 wines for under $30). We got word yesterday that he's offering a new special at his Flatiron pizza joint, Waldy's Wood-Fired Pizza & Penne (6th Ave nr 28th St.). The $10 Anti Recession Deal gets you a small pizza, salad and soda (and includes tax). And the part we like is that it also gets you $10 pitchers of beer after work. They have Brooklyn East India Pale Ale on tap. And here's a BYO special that shouldn't be missed. Tabla (Madison at 25th St) is offering “Tabla’s 10″ menu in celebration of the restaurant’s 10th anniversary every Wednesday night on the upper level of the dining room. The menu will feature a rotating set of small seasonal dishes, all priced at $10 or less, including items like sourdough nan stuffed with spiced potato, kalonji seeds and cayenne, and a Goan pork sausage sandwich on a brioche bun. Better yet, Tabla has a new BYO corkage policy in effect -- no corkage fee on first 2 bottles, $25 each additional bottle. We saved the best for last. It was not too long ago that a martini, itself, would cost you $20 in Manhattan. Betweeen now and May 16th, for just $20, Village (W. 9th at 6th Ave) will give you the martini + an 8oz grass-fed prime steak (or salmon) and half a baked potato. Now, that's a damn good deal.

The Benjamin Steakhouse Burger Challenge

***CONTENT
Little did I know when I first signed on to take the Benjamin Burger Challenge that it would eventually morph into the \"Underrated Midtown Steakhouse Burger Challenge\" with a showdown between the Benjamin Burger and the Michael Jordan's Burger. It all started a couple of weeks back with the following call to action from the Benjamin's PR firm to NYC food bloggers and burger critics: \"Critics are invited to come into Benjamin Steak House for the challenge, where we can speed deliver our competitors’ cuts right to the table; or, if preferred, directly to your desk to sample from comfort of your office.\" Some bloggers wasted no time in denouncing the legitimacy of the challenge in light of the Benjamin's obvious \"home-field advantage\" and the inherent unfairness to the challengers. Adam Kuban, managing editor of Serious Eats and founder of burger blog A Hamburger Today, left the following comment on Eater: \"Home field advantage is right, which is why AHT won't be taking them up on this thing.\" My feeling was that I would take them up on their offer and, at best, I would get to simultaneously try four NYC burgers, including one burger I had yet to try, and, at worst, I would write about the misgivings of a one-sided burger challenge organized by a steakhouse PR firm that will go to great lengths to garner publicity for its client's burger. Besides, unless your a burger aficionado the likes of Josh Ozersky or Nick Solares, it's not often you get the invite to taste test four of NYC's best burgers side-by-side. So I put my conscience aside and contacted the Benjamin's PR team to see if I could get in on the action (see disclaimer at the end). I received a response asking me to pick a time and day and informing me of the following: \"Our main challengers are BLT Burger, J.G. Melon, Corner Bistro and Burger Joint. We are recommending that reviewers pick their top three from these to rate side by side, but if you have one you absolutely MUST try next to Benjamin Burger, let me know and I’ll try to make it happen.\" I was hoping for at least one or two other steakhouse burgers (Smith & Wollensky Grill, Michael Jordan's, Wolfgang's, etc.) but I decided not to be difficult and selected J.G. Melon, Corner Bistro and Burger Joint as the challengers. A follow-up email informed me that we were all set for 1pm on Tuesday, May 5th for the challenge. To compare opinions and help determine the \"winner\", I would be joined by my friend Mark, who is a burger aficionado in his own right. Mark was the first to tell me about the famed $26 Minetta Black Label Burger, which I tried for the first time just two days before this challenge. You could let a Minetta Black Label sit in a 'fridge for two days and I'd still put it up against any burger in the city. Yes, it's that good. But back to the challenge at hand. Mark and I arrived at Benjamin Steakhouse and were graciously greeted by the staff and led to our secluded tasting booth. The four burgers were brought out to us and we didn't waste any time. We followed the Rachel Ray method of burger tasting, which involves cutting each burger in quarters and tasting from the middle. First up, we tried Burger Joint and the Benjamin burger. Burger Joint tasted like classic Burger Joint to me though it was closer to medium than medium-rare. I did notice that the meat doesn't seem as fresh as it used to be. Mark didn't care much for the Burger Joint burger, likening the meat to something out of a can of dog food. We both agreed that the Benjamin burger was well-prepared as a nice medium-rare, if not just a tad more medium, and exhibited a nice flavor profile. The difference in the quality of the burger blends between the two burgers was readily apparent. The Benjamin meat was juicy and moist with a nice char on the outside and had nice texture and a great depth of flavor. I guess the 28-days of dry aging has to count for something. It's only seasoned with kosher salt, and that's definitely all it needs. Just check out the juices seeping into the bun in the picture below and you can tell this is one heckuva burger. Of these two, the Benjamin was hands-down the better tasting burger. The meat quality wasn't even comparable. Next up was Corner Bistro and J.G. Melon. I've had numerous Corner Bistro burgers in the past and unfortunately the one that was delivered to us was nothing like what I usually get there. First of all it was way overcooked. Unlike the picture of the Benjamin burger above, there are no meat juices flowing between burger and bun. The burger was fairly dry and lacked the buttery texture and delicious flavor I have come to know from a Corner Bistro burger. You can see the difference in the bottom picture of a CB burger from a few months back. It was supposed to be medium rare and what we got was something between medium and medium well. This was my least favorite of the four burgers, lending some credence to the notion that Corner Bistro is the city's most overrated burger. I viewed this instead as an anomaly, or perhaps a sign of Corner Bistro's inconsistency, since the most recent burger I had there was one of the best I've had in the city. Mark pretty much agreed with me on this one, except he disliked the Burger Joint burger even more than the Corner Bistro one. Now, I'm not a huge fan of J.G. Melon (largely because I find the burgers a bit too small and not entirely satisfying) but the burger they delivered was pretty much spot-on medium rare. It was a well-constructed burger with a good burger-bun ratio. Solid. Very solid. We both agreed that it was far and away better than either Burger Joint or Corner Bistro with good flavor and texture, but that it still didn't hold a candle to the Benjamin burger. VERDICT Mark and I both agreed that the Benjamin burger out-classed and out-muscled its competition in this challenge. To be honest, it really wasn't even close. The half-pound, dry-aged Benjamin burger is the creation of Executive Chef Arturo McLeod, who spent 20+ years honing his meat talents at Peter Luger's. His burger blend consists of New York Strip, Ribeye, and Filet Mignon- all dry-aged for 28-days and seasoned in-house (using only kosher salt). This is one high-quality beef blend that exudes tons of flavor. At $15.95 including fries it's not a bad deal at all for a steakhouse burger, though it should be noted that none of the other burgers we tasted cost more than $8.50. If Benjamin would offer a quarter-pounder version w/ fries for $10 it would be a force to be reckoned with among Midtown Lunch'es. BUT NOT SO FAST I wasn't fully satisfied though. In light of the factors below that unfairly tilted the playing field, I couldn't bring myself to write this review of the challenge without confirming on my own whether the Benjamin burger is always prepared as well and tastes as good as it did that day. I needed another challenger. For months I've been hearing great things about the burger at Michael Jordan's Steakhouse. In fact, on the Eater post about the Benjamin challenge two commenters mentioned the Michael Jordan's burger, with one pledging his loyalty to it. As Michael Jordan himself is no stranger to what home-court advantage means, I decided to set up my own little follow-up Burger Challenge without either side knowing what was going on. Stay tuned to find out how the Benjamin burger stands up next to the burger that many call the most underrated burger in the city. I provide the following disclaimer in good faith and in accordance with the Food Blog Code of Ethics: 1. We did not pay for any of the burgers involved in the challenge (or for the glass of Malbec I drank). 2. All aspects of the competition were coordinated and organized by the Benjamin's PR firm, i.e. they ordered and picked up the challenger burgers, they selected the pool of challenger burgers, they hijacked the challenger's daily meat deliveries, etc. 3. The challengers faced a number of disadvantages, including but not limited to, the following: (a) there is no such thing as \"speed delivery\" in Manhattan during lunch, and as such, the challenger burgers experienced a significant delay time between exiting the grill/griddle and entering our mouths; (b) unlike the Benjamin, the cooks of the challenger burgers had no idea that the burgers were going to be involved in a competition; and (c) they're not using the exclusive Black Label blend developed by Pat La Frieda (note: the Benjamin burger and every other NYC burger is equally disadvantaged in this respect). 4. Benjamin Chef Arturo McLeod knew that he was preparing a specific burger specifically for our Burger Challenge.

Drink to Your Health: Rouge Tomate's New Lounge 'StirRED' Opens Today With Week-Long BOGO Special

We got word that StirRED, the new lower level lounge at Rouge Tomate, is opening today and that for the entire opening week \"your second drink will be on the house.\" Wonder if that applies to drinks 4, 6, 8 and 10, too. Rogue Tomate, the Brussels-based behemoth of a health-conscious restaurant on East 60th, adheres to an 85-page nutritional charter -- the sacred text of a corporate philosophy known as SPE, an acronym for Sanitas Per Escam, or Health Through Food. The doctrine involves nutrition, sourcing and social and environmental consciousness, and it is all monitored by a full-time dietitian. Curious where that leaves room for alcohol, but apparently the cocktails all have to play by the \"house rules\" and the pre-prohibition style cocktail list features a selection of housemade sodas, brandies and soaked cherries. You can expect about half the calories that these cocktails would typically have. StirRED also has a menu of various Tapas-style cuisine, as well as some sweet treats. The full menu appears below here. Singapore Sling Gin, Pineapple Juice, Lime Juice, Cherry Mai Tai Zacapa Aged Rum, Pineapple, House-made Almond Milk, Lime Juice Old Fashion Bourbon, Orange, Cherry, Bitters, Ginger Juice, Soda Moscow Mule Smirnoff, Ginger Beer Dark and Stormy Gosling’s Black Seal Rum, Ginger Beer Hemingway Daiquiri White Rum, Lime Juice, Grapefruit Juice, House-Made Cherry Liqueur Sazerac Rye Whiskey, Peychauds Bitters, Absinthe Queen’s Cup Pimm’s, Cucumber Purée, Mint, Lemon Juice Ramos Fizz Gin, Lemon Juice, Orange Juice, Orange Bitters, Yogurt, Soda Mint Julep Bourbon, Mint Syrup, Lemon, Served in a Classic Julep Cup Tequila Maria Tequila, Basil, Spiced Tomato Water, Lemon Savory Chickpea Hummus and Panisse Marinated Olives, Pickled Vegetables, Flatbread Crisp Tombo Tuna Poke Sugar Snap Peas, Honshimeji Mushrooms, Jicama, Sesame Heirloom Beet and Carrot Salad Horseradish Yogurt, Parmesan, Sugar Snaps Market Oysters Pineapple Vinegar, Crispy Ginger, Mint Duck and Pistachio Pâté Rhubarb, Pickles, Sourdough Toast Sweet Chocolate & Banana Caramelized Banana Napoleon, Roasted Banana Sorbet, Hot Cocoa Warm Almond Crepes Marzipan, Grapefruit, Kumquat, Toasted Almond Milk Sherbet Local Blue Cheese & Dried Fruit Chutney Semolina-Raisin Pain Perdue, Fuji Apple, Toasted Hazelnut Spring Fruit & Sorbet Plate Assorted Cookie Plate SHARETHIS.addEntry({ title: \"Drink to Your Health: Rouge Tomate's New Lounge 'StirRED' Opens Today With Week-Long BOGO Special\", url: \"http://www.winedanddined.com/2009/05/rouge-tomate-nyc-lounge/\" });

My First Meal at Il Mulino (by Guest Writer Kristi)

Antipasti: Bottles of wine consumed: 2 (1 white and 1 red) / Number of times \"Happy Birthday\" sung: 2. The start of your meal at Il Mulino is an onslaught. There is no other way to describe it. You are attacked from all angles and all directions with food. First, a huge bread basket is filled with rustic Italian bread as well as small, toasted garlic bread. Next, a plate of fried zucchini appeared. Both breads were delicious, but I thought the fried zucchini was way too oily. It's like the taste of the smell of your neighborhood Chinese food take-out joint. The flavor of the zucchini doesn't come out at all. But that was okay because next came the big hunk of cheese (which SO made me think of big hunk of cheese day from the West Wing). Everyone gets a smaller chunk of the larger chunk of fresh parmaggiano reggiano (one of my favorite all-time cheeses). Then came a fresh tomato bruschetta and exactly one mussel. The one mussel was not memorable. But the tomato brushcetta was delicious - fresh, bursting with flavor of the tomato and a hint of garlic and basil. I only wish they had given us just the tomatoes to put on the bread we already had out on the table because the bread they gave us was totally soggy. Which reminds me, we got yet another bread basket full of warmed garlic bread. I advise to try to restrain yourself during this onslaught. A ridiculously large meal is still in store. Piatti Del Giorno Quote of the night: \"I'd rather end up in rehab than have cats.\" Ha. I almost spit wine on my menu. Although the menu is quite extensive and includes the probably fantastic, but typical Italian fare, the real gems lie in the specials. My only problem with this is that the specials were almost as long as the menu itself and they recite them to you tableside. I used to be a waitress, so I understand how impressive it is to be able to rattle off a long list of specials for diners who can't imagine being able to memorize all that information. However, when specials are so long it takes 5 minutes to explain, I would prefer to have it written down. Listening to all the specials was way too much to digest (pun intended). But at the end of giving us the specials, the waiter said, \"and if you a wanna something else, we can make you whateva you like-a.\" Perfect. I had remembered a lamb ragu pasta dish that sounded wonderful. But it was served with spaghetti, and I prefer ragu with a wider pasta. I explained this to the waiter and asked for a tagliatelle, but he understood and immediately recommended the parpadelle over the tagliatelle, which is really what I wanted. I just get my pastas confused. I was in good hands. I relaxed. I had previously heard rumours about the larger than life portion sizes here, so my friend Wendy and I decided we would split a pasta and a fish. The branzini special sounded light and perfect - our waiter recommended that we get it grilled. He said it was much better that way. We were also instructed to get another fish, so we also ordered the salmon special, which came pan-seared with chanterelle mushrooms and broccolini sautéed in garlic sauce. I had already resigned myself to letting my waiter determine my culinary fate. I was in his hands, and I was not going to argue. Ginger and her mother split the porcini and truffle ravioli and grilled branzini. Ginger's brother, Chuck, got the filet. Despite the massive amounts of antipasti we were already served, I was ready to dig in. Primi: Number of bottles consumed: still 2 / Number of times \"Happy Birthday\" sung: 4 When the large bowl of pasta was set down in front of me, I immediately assumed that I would be splitting this bowl with Wendy. However, another large bowl was placed in front of her as well. Simultaneously, we looked at each other, then at the waiter. \"We split it for you already,\" he said. Holy mother. At the moment, I was happy we decided to split. But the next day, when I wanted to relive the sweet taste of lamb ragu, I was admittedly a little sad. The lamb was tender and it melted in your mouth and the homemade pasta was cooked perfectly. I was in an Italian wonderland of flavor. I also had the fortune of sampling the porcini and truffle ravioli. The sauce was thick and creamy and it highlighted the porcini flavor and the hint of truffle coming through in the background. The filling was similarly decadent. The ravioli pasta itself was good, but I thought it was a bit too thick. I would have preferred a more delicate ravioli. But who am I kidding? If that was my dish, I would have inhaled it. Photo of Raviolo ai Porcini (from CheekyEats) Secondi: Number of bottles consumed: 3 / Number of times \"Happy Birthday\" sung: 5 Next came the grilled branzini and the salmon. Each dish was extremely different, both in presentation as well as in taste, but they were both delicious. Before cooking, the waiter brought out the whole branzini fish to present to us. We just nodded our heads in drunken approval, as if we would have objected. The branzini was grilled with a tad of olive oil and simply presented with just a side of lemon. The fish itself was light and flaky. The fish was definitely the star of this dish. The salmon was pan-seared with mushrooms and broccolini in a garlic sauce that complemented both the fish and the vegetables perfectly. It was hearty, flavorful and scrumptious. I was impressed with a kitchen that could put out two completely different fishes (one practically bare and one dressed up) and yet they each stood up against one another in taste. I was so full that I only finished less than half of the fish. But luckily I took them home and ate them again for Saturday's dinner, and Sunday's lunch. I also got to try a small, but lovely piece of Chuck's filet. It was tender and cooked a perfect medium rare. All in all, the entrees were fantastic. I only wish I had room for more. Dolci: Number of bottles consumed: 4 / Glasses of homemade grappa: 1 each / Number of times \"Happy Birthday\" sung: 6 Please note, Chuck was drinking only beer and left us after his filet We decided on one light dessert (for our stomachs) and a classic dessert (for just a taste). We ordered the Zabaglione Caldo con frutti di bosco - a warm Italian custard with marsala wine, egg yolks and sugar (supposedly prepared tableside - I do not remember this) served with strawberries; and tiramisu. While awaiting our dessert, a friendly Italian waiter (is there any other kind?) came over with what looked like a wooden bucket full of homemade grappa, on the house. He ladled out a cup for each of us. After a few hair-raising sips of grappa, we decided on one more bottle of red to coat our throats. I was disappointed with the tiramisu - I have had better tiramisu during the feast of San Gennaro. However, the Zabaglione was delicious. I couldn't believe I had never had this dessert before. Light and sweet, it was perfect after a big meal. After over four hours of utter indulgence, I rolled out of the restaurant Violet Beauregarde-style, blissfully content with my first meal at Il Mulino and eagerly anticipating my next.

Trendspotting: Friday Boozy Brunches, Extended Brunch & Is Pitcher-Service the New Bottle Service?

Maybe it's that the recession means there are more people day-drinking. Or maybe it's that Friday wants its own Fun-Day. Whatever the reason, there appears to be a movement towards a 3-day weekend of \"boozy brunching\" in NYC. Last month, Paradou announced that it was adding Fridays (11am-4pm) to its Unlimited Champagne Cocktail Weekend Brunch ($29). Then we got an email from Essex just this past Monday announcing that they, too, will be bringing their famous 3+ cocktail brunch ($16) to Fridays beginning May 22nd and going through Labor Day. Let's see who else follows suit. In other brunch news, we hear 230 Fifth will be soon launching an afternoon brunch and straight from the Eater Dealfeed that sister Aussie Sunday-Funday brunch spots Sunburnt Cow and Bondi Road have extended the hours for their \"Endless Brunch\" (all you can drink + any brunch item for $18) until 5pm. We also heard a little while back on GrubStreet that Nero, well known for its weekend AYCD brunch in the Meatpacking District, was growing a bit envious of its bottle-brunch neighbors Bagatelle and Merkato 55 and was going to begin experimenting with a bottle-service brunch. Supposedly, they were going to keep their AYCD brunch, too. It seems that may have all changed now according to a commenter. At least on Saturdays, the entire brunch menu at Nero is a la carte with $14 apiece mimosas, bloodys, and screwdrivers and, get this, $100 for a pitcher of any brunch cocktail. We know of other places with pitcher-service at brunch (notably Felix with its pitchers of mojitos), but $100 per pitcher? Seems like Nero's trying to make pitcher-service the bottle-service of brunch. So far it doesn't seem like the strategy is paying off for Nero. According to the commenter: \"Oh and it was empty at noon on a sunny Saturday, 3 people were there discussing how they were eating quick and then going elsewhere, no drinks.\" While we may have a lost a boozy brunch in Nero, it looks like Murray Hill has gained one in Van Diemens. This weekend marks the launch of VD's new boozy brunch -- available on Saturdays and Sundays from 11am - 4pm and featuring some typical brunch items, as well as a complete Irish Breakfast, Western Steak Omelets and Eggs Nova. The best part is for $18 you get your meal and unlimited mimosas, bellinis or bloody mary's. Also to be noted, Nero's new MPD sister restaurant, La Carbonara, is offering an AYCD brunch on Saturdays and Sundays from 11-4 where an additional $12 will get you unlimited mimosas, bellinis, bloody marys, screwdrivers and sangria.

You can't \"have your cake and eat it, too\" at this year's annual White House Correspondents' Dinner at the Hilton Washington this Saturday, where Wanda Sykes has been tapped to provide the entertainment. Attendees at Saturday's annual WHCA dinner will get no dessert, the funds being given instead to a local homeless shelter. What a great idea. Jill and I would be all over an idea like that at NYC restaurants serving prix-fixe menus. Give us a glass of wine, give some money to charity and hold the dessert. \"Because of the economy, we are cognizant of the situation in every industry, we are all dealing with the current economic climate,\" said Steve Scully of C-SPAN, a WHCA board member. \"We want the dinner to reflect that.\" Doesn't look like they'll be eating peas and carrots though. Here's a peak at the menu. First course: Sopresso, Prosciutto, Reggiano & Brie Plate, Spiced Olives, Wild Watercress Salad, Warm Crostini Drizzled with Balsamic Dressing. Entree: Porcini Dusted Petite Filet, Paired with Sun Dried Tomato Seared Escolar with Olive Tapenade, Mascarpone Polenta, Asparagus, Cipollini, Green and Yellow Squash, Porcini Mushroom Demi. Dessert: None. It's going to charity where it belongs.

Another (Slightly Hazy) Recap of a Wine Tasting at City Winery: Mendoza Crush Fest 2009

Andy and I headed to City Winery (155 Varick at Vandam) on Sunday with our friends Nathania and Richard. After grabbing a pre-tasting drink at Ear Inn (one of the coolest old-time bars I've been to- move over McSorley's), we headed to the Mendoza Crush party. It had been postponed due to the grapes' boat being held up for poor weather conditions (\"not pirates\") out on the seas. The grapes arrived from the Algodon Wine Estates in San Rafael, Mendoza, and the crush was just starting when we arrived. Because we had some fun getting our crush on previously at City Winery, we decided to leave the grape sorting behind for some serious wine tasting. Good choice number one. Getting Started: There was a tasting area set up with a host of different wines from Mendoza. The tables were not too crowded since we arrived on the early side and avoided the ridiculously long food line. Good choice number two. Why were people waiting on an endless circling line for small samples of barbeque when there was so much good wine ready to be tasted? We had grabbed a barbeque brunch earlier at Wildwood BBQ. Good choice number three. A huge plus for those waiting in line- some nice wine reps were walking along the line and filling their glasses as they waited. The Wine: Argentina has some really great value wine options. I tried a number of wines under $10 that really could do a decent job at any barbeque, summer party, or as a daily table wine. The most famous Argentine red varietal is Malbec (originally from Cahors in the south of France) and the most famous Argentine white varietal is Torrontes (100% Argentine). I stuck with the classics in most of my tastings, but I was surprised to try some nice Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot blends and some really nice Chardonnays and Viogniers. I also never had tried a Bonarda, but realized that this varietal is abundant and low in cost in Argentina. I particularly enjoyed the Xavier Flouret wines- a \"curated portfolio of high-quality, boutique wines from generations-old family vineyards around the world...\" (whose Argentinean wines were being offered on Sun.- obviously). I also enjoyed the sponsor's wines from the Algodon winery (with a team of pourers of well dressed men with Argentinean accidents). The Verdict: After a couple of hours of tasting, my notes go blank and the memory gets hazy. I do remember thinking what a great idea a Sunday afternoon wine tasting is... Sunday Funday! I also remember Andy and Richard sneaking out back to the barbeque to bypass all service lines and snag some snacks that were being prepared courtesy of La Rural Bistro Argentino (Amsterdam b/t 97th and 98th). I do not remember the decision to head to Minetta Tavern for dinner, but I do remember the exceptional drunken dinner and the world's best burger (not sure if this 'world's best' distinction was decided because of the wine-haze or because the Pat La Frieda Black Label Burger is truly unbeatable... I'm going with the latter for now). It was an afternoon of great wine (and a little not so great wine), great food, and great company. The Vacation Idea: After a successful tasting, we also have a new vacation option. The folks at Algodon Wine Estates run a resort, and our friend Kelly took a trip there with her family. They said it was fabulous- golf, horseback riding, white water rafting, and lots of wine...Vacation anyone?

World Cup of Beer 2009

This Saturday, our friends and fellow beer lovers, Martin and Riki, co-hosted the first-annual World Cup of Beer (2009). The premise: an eight beer, single-elimination blind tasting NCAA tournament-style. The rules: each participant tastes two different unmarked beers from clear plastic cups (to ensure a good look at the color of the beer, thank you Riki). Whichever beer had the most votes moved onto the next round. Eight countries were represented - England's Old Speckled Hen (a last minute addition to the tournament after the Fuller's London Pale Ale mysteriously disappeared out of Martin's fridge; Martin blames his \"cleaning lady\"), Scotland's Brewdog Punk IPA (ABV: 6%), Japan's Hitachino Nest Japanese Classic Ale (ABV: 7%), Norway's Nogne O IPA (ABV: 7.5%), France's St. Amand French Country Ale (ABV: 5.9%), Italy's Super Baladin Ale (ABV: 8%), New Zealand Moa Premium Lager (ABV: 5.5%), and USA's Rogue American Amber (5.6%) (America - F*ck yeah!). We drew names out of a hat to determine who would square off against one another in the first round: USA v. Japan (USA), England v. Italy (Italy), New Zealand v. Scotland (New Zealand), and Norway v. France (Norway) With the exception of the Super Baladin Ale, I did not pick a single winner in any of the rounds. Apparently, I preferred the least popular brews. But the voting was generally very close. The only blow out was a match where the winner won 11-1. Unfortunately, no one can remember which match that was, though our friend Charles seems to remember it as the England vs. Italy since he recalls being the only one who voted for England. In his words, \"I didn't like how the Italy beer tasted as sweet as something from Willy Wonka.\" In between our tastings, we had a fine selection of beers to cleanse our palates: Andy and Jill brought growlers of Captain Lawrence Double IPA and the Dogfish Head 90 Minute IPA; I brought a growler of Six Point Eight Days of Wheat; Martin supplied bottles of Dogfish Head 60 Minute; and Riki brought a Lagunitas Hop Stoopid. We were sufficiently prepared to get drunk enough to, say, fall asleep on the M15 bus and wake up in Chinatown. Thank you Google maps for getting me home. In the second round, Italy was the clear winner over the USA but the Norway/New Zealand match was much closer. We took a break to watch Mine that Bird miraculously win the Derby, right before our championship round. And like Mine that Bird, out of nowhere, Norway took our championship 8-5. Although I still think Italy should have taken it all. All in all, it was a great day for the underdog.

May the Fourth be with you! Actually, May the Fourth be with our friend and time-to-time guest contributor Adam down in Atlanta who's celebrating a birthday today. Here are some of this week's best specials, including a Southern-style one in honor of Adam: Pera (Madison b/t 41st and 42nd): It's May Meze Madness at Pera. Through May 30th, choose any three meze out of 15 options for just $9 (Monday through Friday from 3:30 p.m. until closing, Saturday from 5:30). Double up on your special until 7 p.m. nightly, when you can get a glass of wine (from any of Pera’s 15 wines by the glass) or a specialty cocktail (such as the Peratini – Ciroc Vodka, blackberry puree and elderflower) for just $9 to accompany your mezes. Or until 7pm, you can add a bottle of wine (from a selection of 35) for $30. Scarpetta (W. 14th nr 9th Ave.): Celebrating its 1-Year Anniversary in recession-special style. Offering 4-course prix-fixe with wine pairings for $50 during dinner service (May 4-8; 212-691-0555) Jane (Houston b/t Thompson & LaGuardia Pl): A Southern take on the Burger + Beer combo.

Nice! Elizabeth (Elizabeth b/t Houston and Prince): Cinco de Mayo party out back on the deck.

I could use a boozy brunch right about now. Irving Mill (E. 16th nr Irving Pl): Word on the street is that Ryan Skeen will be moving on in a couple of months, but let's hope that he leaves his Monday night $15 burger + beer + more special behind.

Recession Special Alert: Introducing \"Groupon\"

We recently happened upon a new NYC-based online coupon website called Groupon. Every day Groupon offers a new deal from New York restaurants, spas, theaters, events, and more. It's an idea based on a power in numbers, \"collective buying power\" theory. Here's how it works: Groupon promises a business, let's say a restaurant, that it will sell a minimum number of coupons by the end of the day. If you want the deal, you cruise over to the Groupon website and click \"BUY\" before the offer ends at midnight. If the minimum number of New Yorkers sign up before midnight, you'll get a printable gift certificate in your inbox the next morning that you can use until the offer expires. If not enough people join, no one gets the deal and you don't get charged. Today's inaugural Groupon is a $25 voucher to Stir Restaurant (1st Ave @ 73rd) for just $10. Interested? Check out the Groupon website for more details. Looks like at least 20 people have to sign up for the deal for it to be good.

Just read on Nation's Restaurant News that Bruegger's Bagels is seeking to expand into the NY market and it has its eyes on a Midtown location. I was introduced to Bruegger's during my four years in Ann Arbor where the Burlington, VT-based retail bagel concept had a location right on campus. They are shooting for late this year for the first NYC location and hope also to open locations at NYU. Brugger's bagels were solid, if not memorable. They offered an array of deli sandwiches on choice of bagel, coffee and soups. It looks like they've expanded the menu to include paninis and a new line of hot and cold sandwiches.

NYC's Most Unlikely Recession Special: The Legends Suite at Yankee Stadium

***CONTENT
I received an email this past Thursday afternoon from a business partner asking if I'd like two tickets to that night's Yanks game against the Angels. When I realized that these tickets were not only in the Legends Suite section, but were also in the second row behind first base, I pounced. I had heard a little bit about the premium, high-end amenities and features of the Legends Suite Club but had no idea what Jill and I were in store for. We arrived at Yankee Stadium, in all its modern-day, coliseum-esque glory, and proceeded directly to the Legends Suite area. After we got our wrist-bands (think all-inclusive resort), we walked through the entrance that leads you into the top-level of the bi-level Legends Suite Club. Looking around, the decor felt more like a high-end downtown steakhouse than any stadium club we've ever been in. To our right was a sleek bar area with more flat screens per square foot than ESPNZone. And to our left was an amazing looking buffet and dining room. From the bar, you could look out to the field and see the game. Jill and I took a lap around the buffet and then looked at each other and asked \"How much must this cost?\" It made it more fun that we had not done any research on the Legends Suite and so you can imagine our surprise when a server told us it is all free with our Legends Suite access. Everything that is except for the alcohol, which would be fine unless you're Jill and me. We contemplated our next move as we ordered a drink at the bar (Jill a gin and tonic and a brooklyn lager for me): (a) do we grab a drink and go check out our seats, (b) do we walk around and explore the madness that is the Legends Suite, or (c) do we attack this ridiculous buffet. It took not long for option (c) to prevail and we separately made our way around the complimentary all-you-can-eat buffet. We rendezvoused at the bar where our drinks were awaiting our return. I had made my way to just about every station at the buffet. There was a filet mignon station, a paella station, a load your own baked potato station, a hot dog and mini monte cristo station, a duck station, a chicken and butternut squash ravioli station, a salad station and more. Here's a photo tour of my trip around the buffet: We almost forgot we were here for a baseball game. After finishing up our buffet plates and drinks at the bar, we finally made our way down to our seats. Walking through the bottom level of the Legends Suite club, we realized there was another huge buffet set up with what looked to be the same items as the upstairs buffet, as well as a bar with draft beers. As you exit the Legends Suite to take your seats there is a \"grab 'n go\" area with free bags of peanuts, M&M's, cracker jack's, and more. I grabbed some peanuts and M&M's just because. Thankfully, there was enough early action in the game that it was only the bottom of the 2nd inning when we took our seats. The seats themselves are worth mentioning with their teak arms and full cushions. We were struck by how empty the 1,800 or so seats in the Legends Suite area were compared to how packed the rest of the stadium was. Then came our next surprise. All of the food on the massive In-Seat Dining Menu is FREE. I suddenly wished I hadn't gorged myself at the buffet. But that didn't stop us from ordering (for free) a Carl's Philly Cheesesteak, a Lamb Gyro Pita and Truffle Fries. Other options included a Lobster Roll, Flatbread with Goat Cheese and Pancetta, a few special selections from Fresco by Scotto Restaurant, and more. Jill ordered a dirty martini which they brought in a souvenir-style shaker that had at least 2 full martinis in it. She swears it was as good as any extra dirty martini she's had. I stuck with the Brooklyn Lager. We also discovered that there is a dugout lounge (called the Ketel Lounge) close to our seats with more free food to grab on the run, including more Carl's Cheesesteaks and a freezer with ice cream bars, clean bathrooms and a nice bar. It turned out to be a great game to boot. The Yanks came from behind to win with a big rally in the 8th. Now I know you're thinking' \"Yeah maybe a nice recession special when you get the Legends Suite tickets for free, but what about when you have to pay for seats yourself?\" Here's the deal, though. These pricey tickets in the Legends Suite area with all the amenities and free food have plummeted on the resale market. According to an ESPN article, Legends Suite seats for Friday night's game against the Los Angeles Angels that originally sold for $500 could be had for $144 shortly before 5 p.m. on StubHub.com. Legends seats in section 16, row 9, behind the first-base dugout were available for $199, down from their $850 original price. \"We're seeing an unprecedented number of season-ticket holders selling. The market has been flooded. It is a buyer's market for baseball fans,\" said Mike Janes, chief executive officer of FanSnap.com, an Internet search engine that finds tickets on resale sites. Now, if you're willing to go during the week and it's not the Red Sox or Rays in town, you could probably score Legends Suite tickets for less than $100 each. With all the amenities (oh yeah, did I mention the flat-screen TV's in the restrooms), free food and royal treatment, not to mention the great seats at the new Yankee Stadium, we're calling this the most unlikely Recession Special in town.

All these places look great! One I didn't see on the list that I have had great experiences with in the past is SOBs (Sounds of Brazil, 200 Varick St., in SOHO). If you're looking for a unique and awesome experience for the whole family check this place out. I went last year with my fam and had a blast with Brazilian dishes and Bossa Nova. I recommend it - check out their website at: http://www.sobs.com/

I went to Atlantic Grill for Mother's Day yesterday and the experience was indicative of everything that is wrong with the UES (from the perspective of a guy who lives in the UES with his girlfriend.)....too many strollers, too many toddlers treating the restaurant like their own playpen and parents sitting idle, admiring with the grandparents how cute the children were as they slammed into the back of my chair and created an obstacle course for the waiters.

BYO's Spreading Like the You-Know-What Virus

While the SLA has been cracking down on restaurants with temporary BYO policies -- those that allow BYO while they await their liquor license -- several restaurants are following in the footsteps of Alto and either waiving or relaxing their BYO policies to attract customers. We all know the NYC BYO mainstays (think Tartine, Nook, Poke, Cube 63, Peking Duck House, Persimmon, etc.) but did you know, for example, that Houston's is BYO with no corkage fee at both Manhattan locations or that The Little Owl is BYO with no corkage fee on your first bottle? In a recent WSJ piece, Danny Meyer explained why he's been relaxing his restaurant's BYO policies: \"I would imagine that many wine lovers have more bottles in their cellar than they're going to drink in a week, a month, a year, maybe even a lifetime and they're waiting for a special occasion to open them. We wanted to encourage people to enjoy what they already own and at the end of a delicious meal, they can see that the check is smaller.\" In fact, for the month of May, Danny Meyer's Union Square Cafe is reducing its corkage fee from $25 to $10, which is \"really gentle\" according to Meyer. We agree. To find some other \"really gentle\" BYO policies, we've done a bit of groundwork on GoBYO.com and created a list of some of the best BYO spots around the city with corkage fees of $10 or less. But please always call first to verify. We'd hate for you to be left holding the bottle. A Cafe & Wine Room - BYO w/ no corkage fee Alto -- BYO w/ no corkage fee Apiary -- No corkage fee on Monday nights Baoguette / Baoguette Cafe -- BYO w/ no corkage fee Beacon -- No corkage fee on Sunday nights Broadway East -- No corkage fee on Sunday and Monday nights.

@ musigny -- i agree with you. in the plural sense, BYO should be BYOs. i think i was using it in the sense that \"BYO Is Spreading Like...\", so i think \"BYO's\", as in \"BYO is\", is appropriate grammar. but since i do like talking about BYOs in plural, i think i'll list another good one for you -- corkage has been waived until memorial day at dylan prime.

Island Burgers is no longer BYO w/o corkage. They serve a pretty generic selection of beers and wines now. Went there the other week, they charged $10 for a six pack of beer, or $2 per bottle. Not sure on the wine $$.

A Flea Grows in Brookyln (by Guest Writer Kristi)

Saturday I had a chance to visit the Brooklyn Flea in Fort Greene. The Flea, which opened for the season last week, is open on Saturdays from 10am-5pm and features 150 vendors selling clothing, antiques, jewelry and food. As NYMag pointed out a couple weeks ago in its 'Edible Schoolyard' piece, the Flea has become a new destination for food-lovers. I wanted to investigate. First, I recommend checking out the Flea in the late afternoon. The crowds are smaller and vendors are more likely to give you deals (both on clothing and on food). Despite the much smaller, late-afternoon crowd, the line in front of the soul food stall was by far the longest. That was a good sign. Although long lines usually mean good food, I didn't have the patience to wait on line to try what they had to offer. But it was by far the most popular stall when I was there. Note to self if I ever return. I was really there to try one thing - the empanadas from Elsa's Empanadas. This piping hot, baked pastry is filled with ground beef, olives, raisins and hard-boiled egg. You can get 1 for $3 or 2 for $5. The empanada pastry itself was excellent - flaky and buttery. However, I was disappointed with the filling. I am not a huge fan of olives (other than in my martinis) and I did not really like the raisins. I guess I am a purist when it comes to empanadas. I also tried samples from WannaHavaCookie. The sample chocolate chip was yummy (other flavors include snickerdoodle, toffee mills and molasses spice). They also have the cutest homemade whoopee pies. They were pushing a new flavor, vanilla pie with a strawberry filling, but my friend Becky wasn't a fan. However, I would still be interested in trying a different whoopee pie flavor- like peanut butter and chocolate or the classic chocolate and vanilla- under different circumstances (i.e. not baking in the sun all day). The food highlight for me was the fresh ricotta I brought home from Salvatore Brooklyn. They sell a ½ pound for only $7; for $9, you get the ricotta and a fresh, huge baguette from Amy's bread. Because it was the end of the day, the very nice woman working the stall threw in the bread for free. This ricotta is creamy, fresh and delicious and the bread was perfectly soft on the inside and crusty on the outside. I have been snacking on it all weekend. The stall also sells cannolis piped with the fresh ricotta. Now that I know how delicious the cheese is, I regret not getting one of those Italian treats. I don't know if I would head all the way out to Fort Greene again just for the food at the Flea (Salvatore sells its ricotta in several other locations, and it is a long walk from the Atlantic/Pacific subway stop). But, everyone I encountered was so friendly and generous (the woman who sold me a beautiful necklace gave me a discount for paying cash and gave me some of her sun block!), I would go back if I was ever in Fort Greene again on a Saturday. The Brooklyn Flea - located at Bishop Loughlin High School on Lafayette Ave between Vanderbilt & Clermont Avenues in Fort Greene, Brooklyn.

Another day. Another Restaurant Week. Not that we're complaining, though. Especially since this one revolves around wine. Vibrant Rioja, an organization formed to promote the Rioja wine region in the U.S., has teamed up with 50 or so NYC restaurants to offer prix-fixe deals and other specials that revolve around the region's bold, bright tempranillo-based wines. The specials vary by restaurant, so we've done a little digging to un-earth the best Rioja Restaurant Week deals: Smith's (MacDougal nr Houston) -- Offering 25% off any Rioja bottle. Go Monday or Tuesday night and double your Recession Special by combining with the $35 Chicken For Two offer. Thanks to Grub Street, we already know this one's a good deal. Chinatown Brasserie (Lafayette nr Great Jones) -- $50 four course prix-fixe that includes a complimentary glass of Rioja. Check out the menu here. Bond St. (Bond nr Lafayette) -- $50 four course prix-fixe that includes a complimentary glass of Rioja. Check out the menu here. Cru (5th Ave. at 9th St.) -- The granddaddy of NYC wine lists, Cru is offering both a $50 four course prix-fixe and 20% off bottles of Rioja. Here's the menu. Indochine (Lafayette b/t 4th and Astor Place) -- Offering a diverse $50 prix-fixe that includes a glass of Rioja and also 20% off bottles of Rioja. Here's the menu. Center Cut (W. 63rd in the Empire Hotel) -- Offering a nice menu that includes 3 courses plus sides for 2 and a complimentary glass of Rioja for $50. Here's the menu. Eighty One Restaurant (W. 81st nr Columbus) -- Here's another chance to double up on your Recession Special. Go for the $30.81 eco(nomy) friendly menu and add a 20% off bottle of Rioja. David Burke Townhouse (61st b/t Park and Lex) -- Get a three course prix-fixe for just $25 a person. Also per the Feedbag, you can bid on high-end wines on the wine list. Sounds fun. It was hard to watch the Kobe Club video on the Rioja Restaurant Week website without feeling a little bad. While they're definitely not gonna be offering a $50 prix-fixe with complimentary glass of Rioja anymore, $50 may get you a couple of samurai swords. Like you couldn't have guessed that Artisanal would be participating in this special. They're doing a $50 prix-fixe with complimentary glass of Rioja and 20% off a bottle of Rioja.

Fresh off it's 50% off everything-on-the-menu special on Tax-Day that packed the house, One if by Land, Two if by Sea has launched a Recession Special that it's calling the \"After-Work Supper.\" It's actually a nice, euphemistic spin on the \"Early-Bird Special.\" The deal is $45 per person and is available Mondays through Fridays between 5:30-6:45pm. Sadly, the Beef Wellington is not listed among the entree choices. See the full menu here. Kinda looks like an extension of Restaurant Week for OIBLTIBS, but with a $10 supp. SHARETHIS.addEntry({ title: \"One if by Land, Two if By Sea's $45 Three-Course \"After-Work Supper\"\", url: \"http://www.winedanddined.com/2009/04/one-if-by-land-two-if-by-sea-after-work-supper/\" });

From the submission wire, we learn that The Grape Brokers at Marc Forgione is hosting a Three-Course Domaine du Vieux-Telegraphe Vertical Dinner at Marc Forgione this Wednesday. This is one for our \"If Money Were No Object\" list of events. Tickets are $185/ $350 per couple (all-inclusive)and are limited to 36 seats. For tickets or more info, contact Melissa@TheGrapeBrokers.com or call 917.902.3354. Domaine du Vieux-Télégraphe is one of Chateauneuf du Pape’s most famous estates. Guests will be tasting 1997 through 2003 vintages. Here's a look at the menu and pairings -- looks like you get 2 glasses per course! First Course: Egg Yolk Ravioli, Braised Ramps, Duck Confit, Garrigue Essence 1997 Domaine du Vieux-Télégraphe Chateauneuf du Pape la Crau Wine Advocate # 121, Feb 1999 RP: 87-89 “The 1997 Chateauneuf du Pape is an evolved, forward, richly fruity wine with medium body, and plenty of smoke, pepper, Allspice, black cherry and Provencal herb aromas. It is seductive, round, charming, and sexy. The wine reveals pepper and spicy aromas.” 2000 Domaine du Vieux-Télégraphe Chateauneuf du Pape la Crau Wine Advocate # 145, Feb 2003 RP:91 “The elegant 2000 Vieux Telegraphe La Crau possesses 14.8% alcohol, along with a deep ruby/purple color, charming, rich, fruitiness, and firm tannin in the finish. With loads of freshness, copious quantities of pepper, seaweed, and black fruit characteristics, and a distinctive minerality, this full-bodied, sweet 2000 requires 2-3 years of cellaring; it should age well for 15-16 years. Anticipated maturity: 2005-2018.” Second Course: Vadouvan Curry Braised Lamb, Cancale Carrot Puree, Chios Spiced Peas 1999 Domaine du Vieux-Télégraphe Chateauneuf du Pape la Crau Wine Spectator, Dec 15, 2001 WS:91 “Beautiful Rhône red. Full-bodied, rich and ripe, with plum and blackberry notes and some real tannic grip. Mineral edge adds complexity to this impressive Châteauneuf. Built for the cellar. Best from 2003 through 2010.”–PM 2001 Domaine du Vieux-Télégraphe Chateauneuf du Pape la Crau Wine Advocate # 151 Feb 2004 RP:93 “The 2001 Chateauneuf du Pape La Crau is gorgeous, structured, impressive. Full-bodied…with great depth, purity, and heady aromatics, this 20,000-case blend of 60% Grenache, 15% Mourvedre, 10% Syrah, and 15% miscellaneous amounts of the other permitted varietals will easily rival the 1998. A deep ruby/purple-tinged color is accompanied by a sweet perfume of salty sea breezes, seaweed, melted licorice, kirsch liqueur, creme de cassis, and iodine ... a classic Vieux-Telegraphe aromatic display. Powerful as well as firmly structured, this is a wine to lay away for 4-5 years. It should prove to be uncommonly long-lived, lasting a minimum of two decades. It gets my nod as the greatest Vieux-Telegraphe since the 1998.” Third Course: Cheese Affine 1998 Domaine du Vieux-Télégraphe Chateauneuf du Pape la Crau 1998 Châteauneuf-du-Pape Retrospective Sep 30, 2007 WS: 94 “The color remains dark, with aromas of grilled herb, tobacco and beef leading the way for currant, chestnut and garrigue notes that are carried by the prominent tannin structure. The chewy, mouthfilling finish is starting to let some sweet flesh come out from behind the iron and stone notes. Still needs time, but this is rock solid. Best from 2009 through 2027.”-JM 2003 Domaine du Vieux-Télégraphe Chateauneuf du Pape la Crau Wine Spectator, Dec 31, 2005 Top 100: 2005, Rank: 53 WS:93 “Tight at first, but quickly picks up steam in the glass, with dark cherry, plum, tobacco, pepper, mineral and hot stone notes pumping through the long, fruit- and terroir-filled finish. Really fleshes out nicely, with velvety tannins that are atypical in '03. Drink now through 2020. 17,000 cases made.” –JM SHARETHIS.addEntry({ title: \"3-Course Domaine du Vieux-Telegraphe Vertical Dinner at Marc Forgione\", url: \"http://www.winedanddined.com/2009/04/wine-dinner-marc-forgione/\" });

Work Hard, Play Hard, 'Wine & Dine' Hard, Cleanse!

We've been doing some aggressive wining and dining lately, so with the weather starting to finally turn and with summer in sight, I figured it was about that time of the year to kick up the exercise routine and to get healthy. I cannot give up all the great food, wine, and craft beers that I love, but to balance things out, I could use a mid-week break every now and then to make sure I'm ready for bikini season (and to make sure my body is more happy with me- especially my liver). So, we've been hearing about the Blueprint Cleanse for a while and have had some friends who have been doing the cleanse fairly regularly. I brought up the cleanse at a friend's birthday party last weekend, and I was shocked to hear that 2 of the people I was talking to had tried it and spoke highly of it! I checked out the Blueprint Cleanse on-line and learned that a 1 day cleanse cost $75 and a 3, 5, or 6 day cleanse costs $65 per day, so before I jumped into a 3 day juice diet (that would cost $195), I figured I would do a test run for 1 day. I cancelled my happy hour plans for Thursday night and I ordered 1 day of the \"Renovation Cleanse\" on-line. There are three levels of the cleanse (Renovation, Foundation, and Excavation- sounds scary), so clearly I went with the beginners \"gateway cleanse.\" The website says that this level is for the beginner - \"the 'I'll have my martini with a side of steak, please' type.\" Perfect- I'm in! The Goods: I picked up my Blueprint Cleanse supplies on Wednesday after work, the evening before the cleanse was to begin. They will deliver it to you (at your \"home, office, corner deli, or wherever else you're going to be\"). The deliveries happen between 3 and 9 pm on Sundays and Wednesdays and they will call you 15-20 minutes before delivery to give you a heads up. One of their pick-up locations happened to be on my walk home from work route, so that was an easier choice for me. My juices came in a nice purple thermal lunch bag with an ice pack to keep them cool. The thermal bag was in a very fashionable lime green tote. All the bottles were numbered and the ingredients were labeled (this is a very easy, i.e. an idiot proof cleanse- the bottles even state: \"We Think. You Drink.\"). The packaging, website, logos, etc. were all very sleek and modern- just like you'll be once you start cleansing! I was into the vibe and was excited see a cleanse welcome e-mail as I embarked on my day of cleansing. The Drinks: Drink No. 1: Romaine + Celery + Cucumber + Kale + Parsley + Green Apple + Spinach + Lemon = What am I drinking here?!? I read the ingredients first, and, although I eat and enjoy all of them individually, I did not think having them juiced and blended together would be an enjoyable experience. I was actually surprised to see that I didn't mind the juice. It's certainly green, but it tastes reasonably good. I think the sweetness from the green apple was a much needed addition. It doesn't taste too vegetal, and I ended up having no problem with my green juice breakfast. If I had any suggestion for the juicers over at Blueprint, it would be to add a little mint (but then again, they're the experts, not me). Drink No. 2: Pineapple + Apple + Mint = Awesomeness! I feel like I could be drinking this out of a martini glass at a rooftop bar on a hot summer evening or out on the beach with sand underfoot and palm trees swaying overhead. The mint really adds a refreshing element to the juice and balances out the sweetness of the pineapple. Drink No. 3: Romaine + Celery + Cucumber + Kale + Parsley + Green Apple + Spinach + Lemon = Yep, Again. Ok, back to my green juice breakfast. This kind of makes sense. With all the veggie juice, it does feel more like a meal than just having fruit. I also feel (with no basis at all) that I should be more full after drinking this than the sweeter juices. Drink No. 4: Water + Lemon + Cayenne + Agave = Did I accidentally sign up for the Lemonade Diet? Remember all the press about Beyonce and Robin Quivers (from Howard Stern) losing a ridiculous amount of weight on the Lemonade Diet (or the \"Master Cleanse\")? Women all over the country were living off nothing but freshly squeezed lemon juice, cayenne pepper, grade B organic maple syrup, and water. Well, switch the maple syrup to agave, and we've got the same spicy lemonade here. I LOVE it though! The cayenne pepper is so subtle but it does really add an undertone of heat, and other than that you're drinking lemonade. This is a kicked up version of our favorite childhood summer drink. I could really drink this all day. Drink No. 5: Carrot + Apple + Beet + Ginger + Lemon = Time for Dinner. Now, I'm getting a bit hungry at this point. I was in the mood for something savory, so this mixture sounded good. It still has the sweetness from the apple juice, but the heartiness of the beet really dominates. I was excited by the ginger, but there is more of a subtle ginger hint than an in your face ginger kick (I was thinking of the orange ginger dressing at the corner sushi place). I like it, but I am imagining my favorite beet salad and wishing I had a clump of goat cheese to bite into. Color = beet red. Suggestion = more ginger. Drink No. 6: Water + Raw Cashews + Agave Nectar + Vanilla Bean + Cinnamon = Nirvana. I'm not a dessert person. At all. But boy did I appreciate this sweet treat at the end of the day. It exceeded all of my expectations for what could come out of a 16 fl. oz. bottle that was dairy-free, healthy, and that never underwent any fermentation processes. If I was on this cleanse for 3 days or even 5 or 6 days, I can see how this stuff could be my reward at the end of the day. Sides: You are supposed to start off your morning with warm or room temperature water, which I did (more so because I forgot to restock the fridge with water the night before). You can have as much herbal tea as you would like and as much water in between meals. My friend gave me a special fasting tea from Yogi Tea, which was very nice (made with garcinia fruit to suppress the appetite). I'm a tea drinker and very, very rarely have any coffee, so this worked well for me. You are also supposed to drink a bottle of water in between juice meals (which are supposed to be spaced at least an hour apart, and which I kind of did). The Verdict: Success! I woke up Friday morning feeling fully refreshed, cleansed, and not at all hungry. It was easy, and the price was worth it for the quality of juice and for the convenience. I wouldn't be juicing this stuff myself in my kitchen at home. I will say that next time I will attempt 3 days, but that's going to be tough. The hardest part of my day was certainly not hunger- it was heading home after a long day of work realizing that I wouldn't be having Andy's-famous-grilled-anything for dinner and realizing that I couldn't delve into the kitchen myself to whip something up with a glass of wine in hand. This was certainly not a problem for one night, but the thought of two more nights of a juice dinner would have been tough. It is about working hard and playing hard, though, so I guess this is where my will power has to kick in next time around.

It almost all seemed to good to be true -- 70 degrees, not a cloud in the sky, a beautiful weekend to look forward to and an email in my inbox Friday morning granting me access to a free meal prepared by chef of the moment, Momofuku's David Chang. But this wasn't just any meal. For one day only, David Chang was taking to the street and working his Momofuku-magic from a food cart. For close to three weeks, thousands of people clicked their way to NBCNewYork.com at 11am sharp each day to answer a brief series of NYC celebrity chef related questions in hopes of being one of the lucky few granted access to the info on the uber-secret street cart location. We hear only around 160 people were selected out of close to 10,000 contest entries. The Chang street cart event was one of the NBCNewYork.com Locals Only meet-up activities, which include concerts, free meals from local chefs and more, that is part of a new marketing push at NBC to transform their local station websites into online destinations. I arrived at the \"secret\" address (318 Lafayette St), which turned out to be the parking lot of Win Restaurant Supply Co., gave my codeword and was allowed in. Surprisingly, it wasn't the mob scene you would have expected. The event coordinators did a great job with crowd control and the line for food at the cart never seemed to be more than 20-25 deep. Even though the secret location was leaked earlier in the day by several websites, the people running the show had a list of all those that had been emailed with access and you had to match your codeword to your name. Guests were given a menu with 3 choices for the meal: vegetarian (rice fries, a shiitake bun and ginger rice noodles), pork (rice fries, a pork bun and sweet/spicy sriracha rice cakes) and chicken (rice fries, a chicken bun and smoked chicken wings). Or you could go for the wild card \"Dealer's Choice,\" which included duck rillette (pulled duck meat) and lobster and grits with a poached egg, scallions and crispy ham chips. Unfortunately, the \"Dealer's Choice\" was no longer by the time I arrived, but they were doing a special lamb shawarma -- the epitome of street cart food -- which came with beets and a white sauce. Some lucky ones were also getting a jar of foie gras (pork terrine). Two picnic tables seated about a dozen guests and those who couldn't grab a seat opted to sit on the asphalt. To quell the burning sriracha post-lunch mouth feel, I went for some of pastry chef Christina Tosi's old fashioned donut soft-serve ice cream made from organic ingredients. It was the real deal.

Yankee Stadium Offers a Wide-Range of Ways to Kill Yourself with Food

(Welcome back by popular demand our friend and guest writer Kristi) Disclaimer: the following account of my weekend of gluttony at Yankee Stadium is a true and accurate description of the events that transpired. This is my story (cue Law & Order music). Saturday – Yankees v. Indians (4-22 loss): My friend Keith and I started Saturday at the bowling alley across from the old stadium with a couple of bud lights. We wanted to show some respect to our old favorites (Stan’s was too packed to handle), and start our day with $4 beers since the average beer at the stadium is $9. When we finally entered the Great Hall and walked through to the concessions, Keith began salivating over the garlic fries immediately. You can smell them as soon as you walk in. But we went straight to our seats because we wanted to catch the first pitch. We started our culinary adventure in the top of the second inning with the Baseball Classic – a Nathan’s hotdog and a beer (Bud Light). The days of the “dirty water dog” appear to be as over as Chien-Ming Wang’s chances of getting his E.R.A. under 10 this season. These hotdogs were kept in an insulated “cooler” and came wrapped in foil, already in the bun. The hotdogs, mine with ketchup, Keith’s with mustard, were just as delicious as last season and only cost $4.50. Phew. First test passed. After only 1 and a 1/3 innings of good baseball, we set out to explore the stadium, and most importantly, to explore the food. The game was already over at this point. We went straight to the bleachers, which you now have access to. One of the scariest parts about the new stadium is that every concession stand has the calorie count of every item offered. Who knew that a hot pretzel had over 600 calories? The bleachers have concessions from Johnny Rockets, Moe’s Southwestern Grill, Familglia’s Pizza and the usual baseball fare. We opted for a Johnny Rockets single cheeseburger (a double is over 1,000 calories!), a side of onion rings, and more beer. We ate in a nice-sized standing area overlooking the outfield, watching our Yanks continue their downward spiral. The burger, which came with lettuce, tomato and pickles, was good. Not the best, but very respectable. The onion rings were also good - greasy, but crispy, and not soggy at all. After laughing at some Mets fans, Keith and I moved on to discover a venerable food court on the lower level in left field. I was overwhelmed with choices – Nathan’s, Arthur Avenue Deli, Boar’s Head sandwiches, Sushi, Noodles, Familglia’s pizza. We decided to walk around, see our options and digest. We happened upon a glass window with a butcher cutting raw beef. We had heard about this! A Lobel’s butcher slices beef in a creepy, peep-show-like window (I was half expecting Madonna to start dancing behind the butcher), and then sells $15 sliced-steak sandwiches at a nearby stand. We weren’t quite ready for a steak sandwich, so we went back towards the food court area. It took me all of 3 minutes to decide that I was ready for dumplings. The Noodle stand sells noodle bowls, egg rolls, and dumplings. For $6, I got 4 boiled pork dumplings. Note: the stand has crusty-looking food in the display window, but you do not get that food when you order. Depending on how you like your dumpling dough, you’ll either like or not like the ones offered here. It is a very doughy dumpling. I am obsessed with dumplings of all kinds so I was pleasantly surprised with the quality. They did not skimp on the pork and the meat had good flavor. One of the great things about the new stadium is that you can order, eat your food and still watch the game at the same time. You don’t have to go through a tunnel to get to the food and beer. So we stood in left field for a bit watching the game and talking with fans that happened to be eating chicken sliders. With their nod of approval, we went to the sliders station. This stand had the option of beef sliders, chicken sliders and buffalo chicken sliders. You can get just 2 sliders, or 3 sliders and fries. For some odd reason they were “out of” 2 sliders, but were able to give us the 3 chicken sliders with fries platter. I argued, but they said that was the rules. I was annoyed at the logic, but not the result. We took the 3 chicken sliders with fries and got more beer. The fries were crinkle cut, like Nathan’s, but not nearly as good and a bit soggy. The chicken sliders were good, much like any elementary school fried chicken cutlet, but I wish they had come with cheese or mayo or something. I ended up putting a lot of ketchup on mine. At that point, Keith was still talking about garlic fries, so we wandered back towards the first base/right field side (we had almost completed a full circle). On the way, we happened upon the “farmers market” pictured here. This market basically consisted of a stand with fresh fruit – apples, pears, etc. It’s no Union Square, and certainly nothing we were remotely interested in eating that day. So we moved on, passing Joba’s father on the way. We were back by the garlic fries, Carl’s cheesesteaks, and the Latin corner. A fellow fan said the cheesesteaks were really good. I was very tempted, but very full. While debating what our stomachs could handle, Keith dared me to get a sample of the garlic fries from the vendors. No problem. However, behind the counter stood a large clear bucket filled with oil and minced garlic. It almost repulsed me enough to not actually try the fries. But I went for it, and with my powers of persuasion, I convinced the vendor to give us a sample. We decided to get a full order for about $6. The fries were much crispier then I expected – with all that oil, I was expecting them to be very soggy. However, they were thin, crispy and not too greasy, but they were very garlicky. We couldn’t finish them, but agreed they were good. At this point in the game (remember, we were there for baseball?), the Indians were beating the Yankees by about 3 touchdowns, so Keith and I decided to head to Tommy Bahamas’ Bar located on the second level in the Great Hall. Shots. We needed shots. A quick shot of Jameson led to a couple of more beers for me, and a Jack and Coke for Keith. He decided to step it up a notch. Although you are not allowed to leave the bar area with liquor, we poured Keith’s drink into one of the many commemorative Yankee cups we had collected (I’m hoping to have a full beer pong set of cups before the all-star break), and headed back to our seats to watch the end of the game. Alcohol note: the bar only has Tommy Bahamas’ rum and the Beers of the World venue at the stadium isn’t open until next month. We got back to our seats just in time to see the 8th and 9th innings. When our shellacking was official, we decided to head to the Hard Rock Café for a nightcap. The bar at Hard Rock was way less packed then I expected, keeps normal restaurant hours, and has typical bar food. We got more beer and decided to get an order of hot wings (choices: hot, very hot or bbq), we got hot. They were good - meaty enough and hot enough for me. We enjoyed. We finally left the stadium around 10pm, after almost 8 hours of eating and drinking. And went to another bar. Good day. Sunday (Yankees v. Cleveland 7-3 win): If you can believe it, Keith and I headed back up to the Bronx for more punishment the following morning. I found Keith waiting for me at Hard Rock with a Bloody Mary and an empty plate of wings. He was hurting. We headed into the stadium through the Hard Rock (a nice feature) and set out to our seats in the bleachers. The bleachers have far fewer vendors actually walking around in the seats selling food, but since you have access to the entire stadium now, it doesn’t really matter where you sit. Sunday’s game was actually exciting, so we sat in the sun and actually enjoyed a little April baseball. After the fourth inning, we both decided that we had dropped the ball the day before by not trying the steak sandwich, so we headed straight to Lobel’s. Even though they have a guy cutting the meat right at the stand, the sandwich we bought had been sitting for a while. The cheese-crusted round roll was a little soggy, but the meat was tender, tasty and cooked medium. The sandwich was very good, but it was very hard to justify spending $15 on it. $10, maybe. We continued walking around a bit, contemplating pulled pork sandwiches from Brother Jimmy’s and eggplant parm heros. I decided to get dumplings again (I have a problem). Keith got a chocolate milk shake from Johnny Rockets. My dumplings were the same as they were Saturday, so they were consistent. Keith’s shake was so thick he could turn it upside down and nothing fell out. That’s how I like it and it was delicious. Our food adventure ended there - I think we both shot our proverbial wad the day before. But, we did get a chance to check out the museum at the stadium. Thurman Munson’s locker, a wall full of baseballs signed by everyone to ever wear pinstripes, and the most recent World Series trophies are the highlights. The Yankees won Sunday’s game in dramatic fashion and we had a great weekend. I was scheduled to go to Monday night’s game as well. But-for a rain out, I would have tried the sushi, the Brother Jimmy’s hushpuppies and either a Philly cheesesteak, or one of the sandwiches from the Arthur Avenue deli. Luckily for me, there are 77 more games played at home this year.

Bad News For NYC In-N-Out Worshippers

So I came across an interview on Fast Company with Stacy Perman, who literally wrote the book on In-N-Out Burger, the family-owned chain that has become a cultural institution. Unfortuantely, as is the case with some other cultural institutions outside of New York (think Waffle House, Chick-fil-A, etc.), they have yet to bring one to NYC. According to a July 2007 post on A Hamburger Today, Departures Magazine started a rumor that In-N-Out was planning a New York debut. Since then we've been waiting and waiting, but no In-N-Out. According to Stacy Perman, it doesn't look like we'll be getting one anytime soon, either. But did you know the reason is because of where In-N-Out gets its beef? Can that really be it? We've got friggin' Pat La Frieda for goodness sakes. I'm sure he would make them an \"exclusive\" black label mix. If you're headin' to the West Coast anytime soon, I can't think of any book that would be better to read on your flight there. Here's the disturbing news from Ms. Perman, herself: FAST COMPANY: So what's next for In-N-Out? Are there plans to move out East? SP: It's slowly expanding, with emphasis on the word \"slowly.\" When [family heir and soon-to-be owner] Lynsi Martinez takes control of the company, she could change things. But there's a reason In-N-Out only exists in four states. Each restaurant gets its beef from specific commissaries, which are within a 500-mile radius. So jumping from Utah to New York seems unrealistic. Oh yeah, and she has some ominous news for Shake Shack if the expansion rumors turn out to be true: You don't think In-N-Out should go public? No, I really don't. When you go public, you open yourself up to a whole new set of pressures you have to follow, and I think that might change the unique culture of In-N-Out. Look at Krispy Kreme. It had a huge fanbase, and people were clamoring for more locations across the country. So Krispy Kreme obliged. It had an IPO in 2000, and it was very successful. But then the chain started rapidly expanding, and soon you could buy Krispy Kreme doughnuts in supermarkets. It just wasn't the same product. There are so few \"real deals\" left, and In-N-Out is one of them.

Just got the email with the secret location and my codeword for today's David Chang Street Cart lunch event. It's so nice of him to cook us up a free lunch that I think I'll return the favor and bring him a little present -- a bottle of Pliny the Elder (my favorite beer -- thanks for the introduction Phil). Notice Paradou in the background of the invite picture to the left - Hint: don't go to that location in the Meatpacking. That's not where it's going down. But definitely do go to Paradou this weekend for the best outdoor AYCD Brunch NYC has to offer. Their outdoor garden is sick! $29 gets you a brunch item and all the bellinis, mimosas and kirs you can handle.

Which Recession Specials Are Really Special?

***CONTENT
With all of the Recession Specials being offered by restaurants these days, it can be difficult to determine the really good ones from the not so good ones. Some are no-brainers. Bar Blanc Bistro's 50% off bar deal (5:30-7pm Sun-Fri) which they recently extended indefinitely is hands-down a no-brainer. Same with Ammos' 50% off your entire bar check on Monday and Friday nights. And ditto to Irving Mill's Monday night $15 Beer + Burger + Whiskey deal. Some restaurants, however, seem to just be offering Recession Specials for the sake of offering Recession Specials. Take Rosa Mexicano's 25-Years=25% Off Anniversary Offer for instance (note the Recession Special in disguise). 25% off sounds pretty good on the surface, right? But take a closer look and you soon realize how asinine this 25% offer is. First, you have to have lunch at Rosa Mexicano and keep your receipt. Then to get your 25% off, you have to go back to Rosa Mexicano (only valid for lunch) within 7 days. I don't know about you, but apart maybe from co-founders Doug Griebel and Dan Hickey and their families, I don't know too many people that are eating lunch at Rosa Mexicano two times a week. We'll keep doing our part to help you navigate the vast sea of recession special choices. Thankfully, there's also Grub Street's \"Deal or No Deal\" and Recession Reviews by 89th & Broke (check out this one of Tabla's 10, a menu of small plates for under $10) to help guide you. Grub Street has yet to strike out with a Recession Special, concluding that both Smith's $35 Chicken Dinner and Elleteria's $33 3-course prix-fixe are DEALS.

We hear the weather is gonna be heatin' up for the weekend and that tomorrow's gonna be beautiful. Well, if you're not one of the few lucky ones that scored an invite to the uber-secret David Chang street cart lunch bonanza tomorrow, we have something else to give you a reason to take an extra-long lunch break. ZagatBuzz reports a \"picnic in the park\" deal at AQ Kafe near Columbus Circle (Broadway b/t 58th and 59th). For $14.95 a person, they'll make you a box-lunch with your choice of sandwich or a salad, side, dessert and a drink. But here's the best part -- if you order with 4 or more people, they'll also throw in a frisbee. I have a feeling MidtownLunch would be all over this picnic idea if AQ Kafe would find a way to offer this for under $10 -- hey, why don't they just make it choice of side or dessert and chop off 5 bucks from the price? Just a thought. SHARETHIS.addEntry({ title: \"AQ Kafe's 'Picnic in the Park' Deal\", url: \"http://www.winedanddined.com/2009/04/aq-kafe-picnic-deal/\" });

Stroopwafels: Danku or No Danku?

Dutch eatery Danku has opened in Midtown to mixed reviews, though Cravings swears by the Indonesian Sloppy Joe + Organic Fries and NYC Foodie recently discovered some unique dishes there worth trying. We got word from Danku today that come April 30th, which just happens to be Queen's Day (Holland's National Holiday), they will begin serving made-to-order stroopwafels, which they tell us are popular sweet treats in the Netherlands. I think I know why these waffles are popular in Amsterdam. In fact, I think I probably had one or ten while I was there last. The waffles will be made on a genuine Dutch waffle-maker. They also tell us that Stroopwafels, which translates literally to “syrup waffles,” are different from the thick rectangular Brussels-style waffles most people think of. They are made with two thin round waffles sandwiched together, with a soft caramel filling in the center. I have a feeling we'll soon be hearing from bloggers and Midtown Lunch commenters whether it's Danku or No Danku to these Stroopwafels. Stay tuned.

A (Slightly Fuzzy) Recap of Last Night's Wines of Portugal Tasting (Plus Why Our Friend Kristi May Start Dating Car Salesmen)

***CONTENT
We have recently discovered Portuguese wines and have been greatly impressed with this mostly undiscovered (at least for Americans) wine region. They are producing some really top quality, age-worthy wines that would rival some of neighboring Spain's great wines. We also love the fact that there are amazing value wines coming out of Portugal - including many for under $10. We hit up the Wines of Portugal tasting event last night at City Winery, and we're happy to introduce a post from our friend and guest writer Kristi: Portugal - Where There's More than Just Port - Last night, Jill, Riki and I met some friends and went to the Wines of Portugal tasting event at City Winery to promote WomensHeart. Having traveled briefly in Portugal, I have blurry recollections of sipping on some fantastic port, but I do not remember having any amazing wine. So, this tasting was a great opportunity to discover some non-port gems. Wine tastings are tricky for obvious reasons - no food + lots of wine = forgetting what I drank. But luckily, I e-mailed myself my favorite tables of the evening (the lawyer in me coming out, clearly). They are as follows: tables 43 and 44, where charming Italian men from Monte Da Penha and Quinta de Ventozelo poured some great whites and ports; tables 47-48 had by far my favorite whites of the evening from Wines & Winemakers by Saven (although, sadly, they're only available in Connecticut right now), they were crisp, light and fantastic; table 49 had a great set of reds as a whole from Sogrape Vinhos S.A./Evaton Inc., and the gentleman doing the pouring was nice enough to direct us to the best port and best overall red of the tasting, which was rather courteous of him; table 50 had the best port of the night from Premium Port Wines, Inc. where a cute, older gentleman (who kind of looked like the Gordon's fisherman - without the yellow getup) commanded the port stage; finally, table 39 had the best overall red that we tried - it was from Herdade Da Malhadinha Nova where the owner's niece does the drawings for the labels - look for a hand drawn cow and you know you've got the right wine. There were definitely some miss-hits - I tried at least two whites that were terrible - very clear (as my friend Kate pointed out, it looked like vodka in a wine bottle), flat-tasting and with a slight, unwanted carbonation. The most difficult part of the evening was the fact that we were unable to pronounce any of the varietals, but Portuguese sounds like drunk Spanish, so that was no surprise. I do recall, however, that the Alvarinho (pronounced Al-va-reen-yo) region was very popular. All in all, it was a successful evening - I even got a phone number from one of the pourers who started the pour with, \"I'm a car salesman, I don't give a sh*t about wine, it's my father's wine.\" He then proceeded to pour us great wine and confiscate wine for us from other unsuspecting tables.

A Brunch of Pics: Absinthe Wine Bar Brunch Fades Into Oblivion While Tre's AYCD Emerges From Relative Obscurity
***AUTHOR

2009-04-21 08:24:00
***CONTENT
We set out early Sunday afternoon with one goal in mind -- to find another standout all-you-can-drink boozy brunch spot in the East Village/Lower East Side. We had checked out Yerba Buena (Ave. A b/t Houston and 2nd) last month and both agreed it's one of the best AYCD brunch spots in Manhattan. Here's why: they don't just pop open cheap $5 bottles of champagne for their $12 unlimited drinks option (cash or AMEX only) or pre-make big mimosa pitchers, but instead offer 3 cocktails that actually receive a fair amount of attention from a mixologist, including a fiery jalapeno bloody mary. (NB: YB's brunch menu says there's a 1-hour limit on the AYCD -- but they didn't enforce it when we were there) Also, the food didn't take a backseat to the booze like happens at so many brunch spots (did I say Sunburnt Cow -- actually, Jill just reminded me that our omelette of the day with sausage and Monterey cheese on our last visit to Sunburnt Cow was definitely better than the omelette at some other brunch spots). The bartender recommended the Steak \"a Caballo\", or steak n' eggs, which I devoured, while Jill loved her Ensalada de Pollo (chicken breast with baby spinach, jicama and avocado) and a side of tasty wild mushrooms. The place is small and gets packed so would recommend making a reservation. If you're spontaneously lazy like myself, you should be able to find yourself a couple of seats at the bar no problem. So back to this past Sunday. We thought Absinthe Wine Bar was going to be our place so we made our way over to 1st Ave (nr 6th St.). We had heard about the $9 unlimited drinks on Grub Street here that includes specialty cocktails like pineapple mimosa, pomegranate mint bellini, absinthe sangria and more. An additional $11 for food, juice and coffee would make this a pretty hard to beat brunch. Unfortunately, the honeymoon is over for brunchers at Absinthe Wine Bar. Now it's $20 for menu item + 3 cocktails, which wouldn't be half bad if they hadn't now also limited the cocktail options to the typical mimosa and bellini. Kiss goodbye to the 6 intriguing cocktail choices we had read about. I think this may explain why there was literally nobody in the place at 1pm on a nice Sunday. A few other AYCD options in the area came to mind -- Bondi Road (the sister of Aussie Sunday-Funday spot Sunburnt Cow), the Sixth Ward and Tre. We passed a number of other brunch spots on the way down and I snapped a few shots. Some observations: Essex was packed as always ($16 nets you 3+ bloodys, mimosas or screwdrivers + brunch item -- tons of choices and the chicken fried steak is mind-blowing -- cash only). Spitzer's was surprisingly packed given that there is no complimentary brunch drink offered -- yet further proof of the beer revolution taking place in the city. Thor was dead despite their pretty good brunch deal -- menu item, coffee and 2 brunch cocktails for $18. Schiller's was wall-to-wall and spilling out into the streets despite no free brunch cocktail(s). And the Fat Hippo was dead. The Stanton Social was not nearly as busy as I remember it being -- you're not that hip anymore, give brunchers a free friggin' drink. Bondi Road was packed (the $18 AYCD option still pulls 'em in -- cash only) and it was a 30-minute wait just to sit at the bar. The Sixth Ward ($14 for brunch item + unlimited mimosa) was empty and we found the menu to be a bit limited. So we settled on Tre and its $17 AYCD brunch (cash only) that includes bellini, mimosa or champagne + a brunch item. The champagne was light and refreshing and my potato pancakes (pic below) were just like Nana used to make (ok, not really but they were still pretty damn good). Jill went with the two eggs with tomato pepper salsa and smoked mozzarella (pic below) which she enjoyed, but I got the feeling she wished they had a build-your-own omelette option. Overall, Tre is a helluva brunch deal. We had 4 glasses of champagne each and 2 tasty brunch items for just about 40 bucks. The service was friendly and efficient. While not quite Yerba Buena good in terms of either the food or cocktails, we will definitely be back and would recommend Tre as an AYCD brunch spot to anyone. .gallery { margin: auto; } .gallery-item { float: left; margin-top: 10px; text-align: center; width: 33%; } .gallery img { border: 2px solid #cfcfcf; } .gallery-caption { margin-left: 0; } $14 AYCD Brunch + Beer Garden at The Sixth Ward Spitzer's still busy even though no free brunch drink More like \"Permanent Construction\" Awesome that Macondo on Houston has bar seats on the street like this ...and they give you a complimentary brunch drink! Grab a pierogi if you're starving while waiting for Prune Essex = Packed You would be crazier if you sold a slice for 75 cents Hey Fat Hippo - you want free advice to fill empty brunch tables -- give a free effen drink! Nice brunch crowd at Cafe Charbon despite no free brunch cocktail. Great specials at The Blue Seats Even a Sports Bar Has Bahn Mi Sliders These Days the only signage at Cube 63 is the mail slot Heard some good things about the drinks at this LES pan-latino From what we've heard, more like \"NAY-burrito\" Delicious Potato Pancakes at Tre The 2 eggs with salsa and smoked mozzarella were good, too.

agree that 6th Ward has limited menu but man is it perfect for a hangover....nothing like loads of pan grease and mimosas to clear your head on a sun afternoon.

I would also like to suggest Tapeo 29. It can be a bit dark at times if the curtains/windows are closed, but they have a really tasty menu and good brunch deals....unlimited Bloodies, mimosas, or screwdrivers (as well as tea or coffee) with your meal that are all around $15.00.

We love Tapeo 29. Never been for brunch though. We'll definitely hit up their AYCD soon. Sounds like a great deal.

100% Halal & Healthy Cart Has a Sister Cart at 54th and Park...With Fresh Tilapia and Fried Shrimp

***CONTENT
When speaking last week with Gamal, who runs the 100% Healthy & Halal Cart at 55th and Park -- home of my favorite street cart salad, I found out that he also owns and operates the Halal Cart at 54th and Park. He told me he gives his guys over there 100% freedom in terms of coming up with menu items and the food preparation. I guess he's not a control freak. He told me they're doing some good and different stuff over there and that I should check 'em out. It being beautiful yesterday I decided to give it a shot. I was pretty surprised by some of their offerings. The guys mentioned that their cart is pretty busy even though they haven't received as much online publicity as Gamal over the past 6 months. They said they were going to put together a combination for me with \"a little bit of everything\" so I could get a good sampling of what they can do (low res pic not included). The first thing I noticed is that these guys do their rice several different ways -- regular, spicy, as well as a few other flavor combinations. I went with the spicy rice. I also coudn't help but notice the lightly breaded fish and fried shrimp sitting above the grill. I asked about the fish and was assured that it was as fresh as any tilapia I could find. The fish and shrimp is certainly a differentiator for this cart. The fish was indeed fresh, as promised (at least it tasted fresh) and there was a seasoning in the lightly fried exterior that I really enjoyed but could not place. I'm gonna have to ask them what it is the next time I stop by. The fried shrimp was also fresh and good (though I must confess I'm not a huge fried shrimp fan). Another differentiator is their side of jalapeno pickles (that's what they called it, though it seemd to comprise more pickles than jalapenos) - this side comes free with all combination platters. It didn't have a massive kick that I was expecting and that I would have liked, but the pickles were in some sort of light, clear sauce that made them pretty damn tasty. Also in my \"kitchen sink\" combination, they threw in some lamb and onions, as well as a falafel, that were sitting on the grill cooking when I walked up. Nothing too special here, really. Good, but probably no better than the lamb and onions you're going to get at any other Halal cart in the city. Last but not least, I tried some grilled eggplant. Can't say I've seen eggplant like this being offered at too many carts, and it was great. The big negative for me as far as this street cart goes was in the \"sauce\" category. The white sauce really had nothing much to it and the only thing they had in terms of hot sauce was a runny, tabasco-ey sauce. They did mention a thick, spicy green sauce that they usually have but had run out of yesterday. Overall, I was pretty impressed with the fish (probably more so by the fact that they even had fish than the actual fish itself, though it was seasoned quite nicely) and the rice variety. They need to get some thick hot sauce like Gamal has, though, or next time I'm gonna have to stop by the 100% Halal & Healthy on my way back to the office to load up.

So, we just heard about yet another Restaurant Week here in NYC. This one is actually more like an NYC restaurant week competition. In fact, they're calling it the Signature Dish Contest. It's all a part of the Continental Airlines International Restaurant Week in New York City from May 1-10th and it's being hosted by none other than Tom Colicchio. Click here to watch Tom present an overview of the Signature Dish Contest. Continental Airlines has assembled 12 different NYC restaurants that represent 12 different countries around the world. Each of the 12 restaurants will create a signature dish and serve it to diners between May 1-1oth (see each participating restaurant's signature dish after the jump). After trying one or more of the signature dishes at participating restaurants, diners are encouraged to then visit the Continental Airlines International Restaurant Week website to provide their feedback and ratings. Chef Colicchio will then take all of the ratings and let us know the top 3 signature dishes voted on by diners. Continental has actually landed some pretty big name restaurants -- Allen & Delancey, Boqueria, Del Posto, Nobu, and Tabla, to name a few. Also, this Restaurant Week offers diners behind the scenes access to some of the restaurants. For example, diners at Delmonico's will get a personal tour of the kitchen, diners at Del Posto will get a tour of the extensive wine cellar, and diners at Tabla will get a tour of Floyd Cardoz's kitchen. Here's a list of the participating restaurants, and their offers.

Point Blanc: Bar Blanc Bistro Extends 50% Off Bar Menu & Beverages Through Friday the 17th!

Andy and I found ourselves in Greenwich Village last Friday night after work and we decided to stop in for some happy hour drinks at Bar Blanc Bistro at 142 West 10th Street (b/t Greenwich Ave. and Waverly Place). We had heard about the amazing happy hour special at the bar - 50% off the entire bar menu (not including burger or oysters) and 50% off all cocktails, beer and wines (by the glass/carafe). We had wanted to check out the new bistro décor and menu, and there was no better opportunity to take a test drive than with the 50% off happy hour (from 6-8 pm now extended through Friday the 17th). It's not a huge bar, so get there early to snag yourself a seat. This is really one of those deals that can't be missed. I started off with a glass of wine while Andy found himself a Peak Organic Pale Ale. We ordered the \"Bitter Ballen\" Braised Beef Ragout Croquettes with Dijon Mustard ($8 = $4 happy hour special), the Duck Liver Mousse with Toasts ($10 = $5 happy hour special), and the Macaroni Cheese Au Gratin with Black Truffle ($9 = $4.50 happy hour special). Our favorite was the mac n' cheese, but everything really exceeded our expectations. The mac n' cheese was bursting with truffle flavor and the sauce was a perfect creamy consistency. It was the best I've had in ages. The duck liver mousse was just what I was in the mood for and it came with some tasty pickled vegetables. The little balls of braised beef ragout (like brisket inside a pastry) were tasty and perfectly crispy on the outside, but the added flavor of the Dijon smeared underneath really kicked them up a notch. Next time, I am certainly ordering the White Bean and Olive Tapenade Crostini ($7 = $3.50 happy hour special) AND the Fries with Dutch Fry Sauce with additional dipping sauce options (I want to try out the Indian curry spice and the Kaffir lime) ($6 = $3 happy hour special with extra sauces for $1). I know Andy will be ordering the Bar Blanc Burger with Vermont Clothbound Cheddar, Homemade Pickles, Bone Marrow Bordelaise Mayo and Fries. We saw one go by and he almost jumped out of his seat to follow it. Although we had only intended to stop in for a few drinks and a couple of appetizers, we were so impressed by the food (and by the fabulous service, good vibe, and fun music selections) that we had to stay and try out an entrée. Although the dinner menu was not 50% off, the food was well worth its cost. We ordered the Hudson Valley Moulard duck chop with faro, vanilla braised leeks, and natural jus ($29) - gorgeously tender meat, perfectly cooked, and spot-on accompaniments. We also ordered the sautéed Brussels sprout leaves with bacon and apple puree ($8) - so savory and perfectly balanced with the tender cubed bacon (also nice to have as a lighter dish with just the leaves instead of the full dense sprout). Go for the 50% happy hour deal, but if you end up staying for dinner you certainly will not be disappointed. Here's the menu: Bar Menu Crostini with White Bean and Olive Tapenade 7 Ham and Fontina Cheese Croquettes with Smoked Paprika Aoili 7 Duck Liver Mousse with Toasts 10 Pancetta Wrapped Sardine with Fresh Basil 8 Macaroni Cheese Au Gratin 7 with Applewood Smoked Bacon 8 or Black Truffle 9 Home Made Country Terrine, Cornichons, Toasts 10 Market Oysters 2.95 each Fries with Dutch Fry Sauce 6 Add’l Dipping Sauce 1 Indian Curry Spice Chipotle Mayo Honey Mustard Blanc Burger, Vermont Cheddar, Homemade Pickles, Bone Marrow Bordelaise Mayo, Fries 15 Chef’s Selection of Cheese 14 Bistro Menu (PLUS SEASONAL MARKET SPECIALS) Hors D’Oeuvres Crostini with White Bean Purée and Olive Tapenade 7 Duck Liver Mousse with Toasts 10 Pancetta Wrapped Sardine, Fresh Basil 8 Ham and Fontina Cheese Croquettes, Smoked Paprika Aoili 7 Home Made Country Terrine with Cornichons, Toasts 10 Market Oysters 2.95 each Appetizers BABY BOSTON LETTUCE AND HEARTS OF PALM SALAD 12 Poached Egg, Aged Pecorino Cheese, Balsamic Vinegar Oil LIGHTLY CURED KONA KANPACHI 12 Anchovy Yogurt, Fresh Cucumber, Celery, Sea Beans CRISPY SWEETBREAD AND BERKSHIRE PORK BELLY SALAD 15 Lentils, Chorizo, Watercress, Fennel Slaw, Sherry Vinegar SEARED MAINE DAY BOAT SCALLOPS 18 Curried Carrots, House Cured Lardo, Bibb Lettuce Sauce SOUP DU JOUR SEASONAL MARKET SALAD Entrées SEARED BLACK COD 26 Wilted Arrowleaf Spinach, Celery Root, Fennel, Saffron Sauce, Salt Cod Brandade LOCH DUART SALMON 26 Braised Escarole, Roasted Radish, Chesnut - White Wine Sauce SLOW ROASTED ALL NATURAL CHICKEN BREAST 26 Parsnip, Comte Gnocchi, Leg Meat Confit, Black Truffle SLOW ROASTED DUROC PORK LOIN 30 House Made Sauerkraut-Braised Pork Shoulder Terrine Grainy Mustard Sauce SIDES 8 MACARONI CHEESE AU GRATIN 7 Add: Applewood Smoked Bacon 8 Black Truffle 9 SAUTÉED BRUSSELS SPROUT LEAVES WITH BACON, APPLE PURÉE 8 SAUTÉED BABY BOK CHOY WITH BACON 8 CAULIFLOWER AU GRATIN with Gruyère Cheese 8 ROAST FINGERLING POTATOES 7 FRIES WITH DUTCH FRY SAUCE 6 Add’l Dipping Sauces 1 Indian Curry Spice, Chipotle Mayo, Honey Mustard, CHEF’S SELECTION OF CHEESE 14 SHARETHIS.addEntry({ title: \"Point Blanc: Bar Blanc Bistro Extends 50% Off Bar Menu & Beverages Through Friday the 17th!\", url: \"http://www.winedanddined.com/2009/04/point-blanc-bar-blanc-bistro-extends-50-off-bar-menu-beverages-through-friday-the-17th/\" });

We just heard about a new monthly wine tasting party called \"Wine Down.\" The first one's coming up Wednesday April 22nd at 7pm and it's being held on the spacious fourteenth floor terrace at Charlie Palmer's Astra in Midtown (979 3rd Ave b/t 58th and 59th). The \"Wine Down\" parties are being hosted by Michael Green, the wine and spirits consultant for Gourmet Magazine. The tickets are $40, which gets you a selection of wines and passed hors d'oeuvres supervised by Chef Charlie Palmer, himself. According to the event info we came across, the mission of \"Wine Down\" is to bring together a cool space, terrific food, bodacious wines, fun music and great people. Sounds pretty good to us.

Check out the deals here. We love the crisp, citrusy Sauvignon Blancs, the reds made from Carmenère, a distinctively spicy French grape abundant in Chilean vineyards, and the big Cabernet Sauvignons. In fact, Wine Spectator's #1 Wine of 2008 was a 96-point Chilean red -- Casa Lapostolle's Clos Apalta Colchagua Valley 2005 (a blend of Chile's Carmenère variety, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon). We recommend stocking up on the following wines from Astor. Casa Lapostolle Sauvignon Blanc - 2008 (Rapel) for $8.49/bottle. Just named Wine Spectator's Wine of the Week and they list the price as $11 making this one a great deal. Errazuriz Merlot Estate - 2007 for $8.49/bottle. We love the Errazuriz Carmenere and we're guessing the Merlot is pretty special, too. Santa Rita Cabernet Sauvignon, Reserva for $11.04/bottle. This is a solid cabernet at this price point. Terra Noble Gran Reserva Carmenère - 2007 for $12.74/bottle. Haven't tried this one, but have heard good things.

Be sure to contact your local Chick-fil-A to verify they are participating - several stores are offering some variation of a Tax Day special, but this is not a national promotion.

Jim Lahey Seeks Apprentice: Must Respond Well to Criticism

The news making the rounds today is of Jim Lahey's Chodorow-esque tirade in the Observer in response to Frank Bruni's lukewarm 1-star review of his 3-month old fad pizza joint Co. (bankrolled by Jean-Georges). We came across this interesting CraigsList posting earlier titled \"Apprentice Needed for Jim Lahey\". It appears that the \"master craftsman\", himself, is seeking an apprentice, excuse me, I mean \"he needs an apprentice,\" in his workshop (really, he's calling this person an 'apprentice' -- that right there should tell you something about Lahey's ego). Here's the full posting: \"Jim Lahey from Sullivan Street Bakery is looking for an Apprentice. A high-profile innovator in the field of bread-making is seeking an apprentice. The right candidate will have a culinary background, be passionate about food, able to follow instructions, anticipate his needs and be proactive in executing tasks. He/she must be responsible, focused, hard working, organized, savvy, and ready to hit the ground running. Knowledge of Manhattan and a willingness to travel are also expected. This is a great opportunity for the right individual to get hands-on experience working at one of the best bakeries in the city, as well as a popular, quality-driven, new bread themed restaurant.\" All we want to know is: Is the right candidate expected to be able to handle criticism well?

Research shows that drinking wine is good for your heart. But you probably didn't know that drinking wine could be good for other people's hearts, too. On Tuesday April 21st from 6-8:30pm, Wines of Portugal will be hosting their 5th Annual Wine Tasting in New York City at City Winery, featuring 40 wineries and 300 wines from all of Portugal's main wine regions. 100% OF ALL PROCEEDS FROM TICKET SALES will be donated to WOMENHEART, benefiting the research, education, and promotion of women's heart health. Sample Portugal's remarkable range, from Vinho Verde's refreshing whites to the Duoro's passionate reds, to Alentejo's new classics and beyond. Tickets are only $40 and can be purchased in advance by clicking here. If you haven't had a chance to check out the new City Winery space, this would be a great opportunity. City Winery is Manhattan's first winery in 40 years. But it's much more than just a winery. The space also houses a world-class wine bar, live music venue, VIP lounge, cellar dining room, and private event areas. Jill and I have had a chance to taste several Portuguese wines over the past few months and have been loving what we've tried at all price points. This is one burgeoning wine region you will certainly be hearing alot more from over the next few years.

Silence of the Lambs: Greek Easter Feast @ Estiatorio MILOS

This picture and description of the Greek Easter celebration next weekend at Estiatorio MILOS just came through our inbox with the subject line \"18 lambs roasting in Midtown.\" This sounds deliciously sadistic: \"The intoxicating aroma of roast lambs will drift down the streets of Midtown from the patio of Estiatorio MILOS during the entire weekend of Greek Easter, April 18 & 19. Centered around food, family, and rebirth, Easter is by far the most important holiday of the entire year in the Greek Orthodox community. MILOS owner Costas Spilliadis will host a lavish feast to break the 48-day Lenten meat fast with roasted lambs, a tradition originating from his native Peloponnese. The festivities will begin at 6 p.m. on Saturday, April 18 when twelve lambs will be slow-roasted on spits right outside the restaurant, while the cooks continuously baste them with branches of rosemary dipped in olive oil. The Saturday meal begins just after midnight mass. The dining room will be lit with candles in ecclesiastical fashion to commemorate the Resurrection. Baskets of eggs dyed a deep red symbolizing life will adorn the tables. The red eggs will be knocked together at the phrase, “Hristos Anesti” (Christ is risen). For those unable to attend the feast on the eve of Greek Easter, six additional lambs will be roasted on Greek Easter Sunday. On Sunday, April 19 the menu will be available à la carte for $35.\" SHARETHIS.addEntry({ title: \"Silence of the Lambs: Greek Easter Feast @ Estiatorio MILOS\", url: \"http://www.winedanddined.com/2009/04/silence-of-the-lambs-greek-easter-feast-estiatorio-milos/\" });

Happy Birthday Elettaria! Welcome to the Recession. Fresh off of Eater's \"One Year In\" feature earlier this week, we learned this morning that Elettaria (8th St. @ MacDougal) has launched a recession special: Sunday to Wednesday we offer our special 3-course tasting menu for $33. $8 adds 2 pours of our custom Sangria (red or white) or Rum Punch. Elettaria is already known to have one of the best happy hour specials in town, not to mention its drink menu was created by folks at Death & Co. and Freemans. From 5 p.m. to 7 p.m. everyday, you can get $8 glasses of wine, $4 beers, and $7 cocktails. They also have some pretty creative homemade bar snacks that include a special hot dog, a take on crab rangoon and a naan pizza is in the works. As to the success of the happy hour special, they tell Eater: \"People are coming in to drink and hang out and it's just kind of fun. People want to drink right after work these days more than ever. Some come in and get wrecked from 5 - 7.\" We'll test the dinner special (after a few half-off cocktails, of course) and we'll let you know what we think.

I'm feeling a bit under the weather today, and it being the first night of Passover, I decided to treat myself to a little Carnegie Deli for lunch. I went with my go-to sandwich -- the Woody Allen. This behemoth is a combination corned beef and pastrami sandwich and was given its name after the deli served as a filming location for Broadway Danny Rose. I always order it with extra slices of rye bread cause there's no way 2 slices of bread can suffice for the close to 3lbs. of pastrami and corned beef that are included. I don't know if it's because today is a Jewish holiday, but I've never seen them make the sandwich so big. It was easily twice the size of the pastrami sandwich that Serious Eats dubbed the \"mother cell\" and used to make 5 \"daughter\" sandwiches. Check out their \"mother cell\" here. I'm telling you I could easily make 8 generously-sized sandwiches from this monstrosity of a sandwich. I even had to tape the top slice of rye bread down to snap a photo.

The NCAA Men's Tournament final is tonight as Michigan State and North Carolina battle it out for the championship (tips off at 9:20pm on CBS). There is no better night for \"recession specials\" than Mondays. Here are a few ideas if you planning to head out tonight to catch the game: Pre-Game: Head to Irving Mill (116 E. 16th St) for the Rye-Fecta Monday Special where $15 gets you Ryan Skeen’s famous Burger, a Pint of Sixpoint’s Righteous Rye and RI 1 Jim Beam’s Premium Rye Whiskey served Julep Style, Neat or on the Rocks. Game Time: Get free Bud Light drafts and well drinks for the first hour of the game at either of the two Village Pourhouse locations (E. Village and UWS near Columbia) or at sideBAR (Irving and 15th St just a block away from Irving Mill). To get this deal, you have to RSVP with your name to melissa@yourpartyplanning.com (via Eater) OR for the serious beer lover, head over to Rattle 'n' Hum (33rd b/t 5th and Madison) for $4 pints of 20 different beers (including many craft beers) and 25 cent wings all night. Better yet, head to Halfsteak/Craftsteak in some baby blue, where, according to Grub Street, “Long time Carolina fan Tom Colicchio will be at Halfsteak tonight watching the championship game. Every time Carolina hits a 3-pointer, the Crafty chef will give a free drink to anyone wearing Carolina blue.” If you're in Brooklyn, may we suggest heading over to South 4th Bar & Cafe in Williamsburg for \"Sixpointopia\" where 2 Sixpoint beers will square off against each other for the title of Sixpoint champion. The winner is determined by which keg runs dry first. All beers are $4.

Director Anat Baron takes you on a no holds barred exploration of the U.S. beer industry that ultimately reveals the truth behind the label of your favorite beer. Told from an insider’s perspective, the film goes behind the scenes of the daily battles and all out wars that dominate one of America’s favorite industries. Beer Wars begins as the corporate behemoths are being challenged by small, independent brewers who are shunning the status quo and creating innovative new beers. The story is told through 2 of these entrepreneurs - Sam and Rhonda - battling the might and tactics of Corporate America. We witness their struggle to achieve their American Dream in an industry dominated by powerful corporations unwilling to cede an inch. This contemporary David and Goliath story is ultimately about keeping your integrity (and your family’s home) in the face of temptation. Beer Wars is a revealing and entertaining journey that provides unexpected and surprising turns and promises to change the world’s opinion on those infamous 99 bottles of beer on the wall.

The '50% Off Bar Check' Special at Ammos is Completely Legit

Jill and I decided to head over to Ammos Estiatorio (Vanderbilt & 45th St) last night for a drink and bite to eat before meeting friends for a drink at The Ginger Man. We were intrigued by the Monday & Friday Recession Special that we originally heard about through Eater's Dealfeed: 50% off your entire bar check, including food and alcohol. We wanted to see for ourselves whether it's actually what it says it is or if there are any catches or limitations. We called ahead (always advisable when you are going somewhere for a special deal) and they told us the deal was still on between 5-9pm on Mondays and Fridays for people sitting in in the bar area. We arrived and were pretty excited to see a couple of open tables around the bar. The bar tables at Ammos are actually quite large. You could probably squeeze in four people. A placard on the table re-confirmed for us the 50% off special. The waiter brought us 2 dinner menus and it was game-on. Jill ordered a glass of Greek wine (Moschofilero-Roditis) that the server likened to a Sauvignon Blanc and I ordered an Anchor Steam beer. Factoring in the special, her glass of wine was $5 and my beer was $3.50. For food, we ordered the Crudo for 2, Koupes (ground beef and lamb, bulgur wheat, lemon and yogurt), and Octapodi (grilled octopus, fennel, onion, red wine vinegar and olive oil). The after-special price of the crudo was $10, the koupes was $5 and the grilled octopus was $8.50. The crudo was fresh and delicious and was adorned with capers, citrus, lemon, and chilies. We also loved the grilled octopus which was as tasty as it was generously apportioned. The koupes was our least favorite of the three dishes, though it was not bad at all. We agreed it could have used a bit more of the yogurt sauce. Our bill came out to $34.50 which is a terrific deal for 2 drinks and 3 dishes. We definitely recommend this 50% off special, which can also be enjoyed on Friday nights between 5-9pm.

Red Newt's Dave Whiting Responds to Death of NY Wine Bill

According to this story on Crains, the proposed bill that would have allowed grocery stores to obtain a license to sell wine is DOA. Looks like the powerful liquor store lobby won out this time around. I think this is a huge loss for NY wine consumers. I was in a Publix in Florida this past weekend and it had an amazing wine section. The increased competition for wine and liquor stores would not necessarily have been a bad thing in my opinion. Dave Whiting, winemaker and co-owner of Red Newt Cellars Winery & Bistro in the Finger Lakes wine region, left us the following comment in response to the news out of Albany. He explains how the death of the wine bill is not only bad for NY wine consumers, but bad for the entire wine industry of NY state: Thanks for your post. I have made some additional comments on this issue that I would like to share with you.... I continue to believe selling wine in grocery stores, alongside food with which it pairs so well, is the best way to introduce new consumers to the appreciation of healthy, responsible consumption of wine with their meals. In failing to pass this measure, we may have missed our opportunity to greatly increase the number of New Yorkers who enjoy wine in this way on a regular basis and have hence restricted our opportunity to grow as an industry. I agree that there are many great wine shops in the state that provide excellent selection and service to their customers. Many of these shops sell our wines. Over the past few days I have received many emails from wine shops who suggest that grocery stores will only carry cheap, low quality wines and will be unable to provide knowledgeable wine service. Then, in nearly the same breath, I hear the cry that the very grocery stores that fail to provide the great selection and service that wine drinkers have come to expect from their local wine shops, are going to take away their customers. This is a perspective on marketing that I don't understand. Even if the grocery store wine selection and service is abysmal as I am lead to believe by some, the grocery store setting will provide a level of convenience that will introduce new customers to the enjoyment of wine. The wine shops will have a competitive advantage to retain their current customers as well as the opportunity to engage a growing customer base. My view on this issue in not borne of a selfish desire to grow my business at the expense of others'. It comes from my desire to grow and expand the wine industry of New York State; from growers, to wineries, to wholesalers, to stores (liquor stores AND grocery stores), to the consumer. The loser that we must not forget is the grower. The grape industry in the New York is facing the most catastrophic downturn since the 1970's. Without a substantial increase in customer base and sales, I will be forced to make drastic cuts to growers who I have worked closely with for the past ten years. But it's not just me. And it's not just the boutique, family wineries that we need to think about. Many thousands of tons of grapes are likely to drop in the vineyards this fall. These are the grapes that would have gone to some of the very large wineries in New York and into the mainstream wines that likely would have been common on most grocery store shelves. These wines don't come from huge, corporate wineries. They come from farms. They come from families who have worked for decades and generations to build the agricultural communities that make up the grape growing regions of New York State. When I speak about this issue, I'm not just talking about a bottle wine and who gets the buck for selling it. I speak the voice of our farms, and our families. And I hope for the day when we can work as an industry to grow and flourish together. Thanks.

Thanks to a commenter, we just learned about a pretty good boozy brunch deal at Thor (the restaurant and lounge in the Hotel on Rivington). Guess it kind of makes sense for them to have a good deal given its proximity to Essex's infamous 3-cocktail brunch. The special $18 prix-fixe gets you a choice of an entree, coffee/tea and two cocktails (choice of bellini, bloody mary, mimosa or screwdriver). And if you're looking to make it an all-out Sunday-Funday boozefest, you can get additional drinks for just $5 each. The brunch menu has some intriguing entree choices, including a brioche lobster roll, baked merguez and egg ratatouille, and a croque 'monsieur' or 'madame'. If boozing it up on Sundays is your thing, click here to see Wined & Dined's Complete Boozy Brunch Guide. We also noticed what seems to be a pretty good Easter Brunch deal at Thor. Details and menu follow... EASTER SUNDAY BRUNCH $ 39.00 PER PERSON 3-COURSE MENU Including 2 Brunch Cocktails ( Mimosa – Belini – Bloody Mary ) & Coffee · Russ&Daughter “ Nova “ smoked salmon, crème fraiche, watercress, Apple Sweet peas & white mushroom soup with truffle oil Roasted beet & baby arugula salad “ Mimosa “ Mixed baby green, gourmand dressing Tuna tartar with avocado & flour tortilla chips Endive salad with blue cheese, walnut, pear, scallion, mustard dressing “ Fisher island “ East coast oyster, black pepper mignonette Buffalo mozzarella & vine ripe tomato salad, balsamic, olive oil, basil · Lamb loin stuffed & roasted, flageolets au jus, baked provencal tomato Flat iron steak & eggs any style, fingerling home fries, baby greens Fresh lobster roll, heart of romaine with green vegetables Pan fried Atlantic salmon, scrambled eggs, grilled asparagus, fingerling home fries Brioche French toast with mango & strawberries, raisin caramel sauce Eggs Benedict, baby Greens, fingerling home fries Smoked salmon salad, string beans, beets, poached egg, orange & grapefruit, mustard dressing “ L’Hambourgeois “ Organic beef burger with cheese, Truffled French fries · Easter bunny surprise dessert Fresh fruit plate with passion fruit sorbet Warm flourless chocolate cake White chocolate cheese cake SHARETHIS.addEntry({ title: \"Thor Has a Boozy Brunch Deal!\", url: \"http://www.winedanddined.com/2009/03/thor-nyc-brunch/\" });

This just came through from our friend Jeff: Excerpt from an article on CNN.com today. Thought of you guys. For Manhattan restaurateur Paul Grieco, sticking to good food and the warm, hospitable philosophy of his East Village restaurant, Hearth, is key to devising dining promotions to combat a 20 percent dip in business from the same period last year. \"Every restaurant out there is leading with the discount, and the consumer -- it's become one big blur. We're all competing against each other -- none of us are coming out winners,\" Grieco said. To differentiate Hearth this winter, Grieco and the restaurant's chef created five winter soups available at the bar for $5 each, paired with $5 glasses of sherry. This spring, Grieco plans to offer $5 spring salads. Hearth's Cucina Povera, a rustic $35 three-course, prix fixe meal featuring entrees such as braised lamb shank, is another offer aimed at budget-conscious diners.

Should We Be Allowed to Buy Wine in NY Grocery Stores? The Debate Heats Up in Albany
***AUTHOR
Andy
***DATE
2009-03-26 09:41:00
***CONTENT
Should wine be sold in New York grocery stores? That is the million (perhaps mult-million) dollar question that has been stirring up quite a heated debate over the past few months. And it seems to be coming to a head this week in the state capitol as the April 1 deadline rapidly approaches for approving the budget. Ostensibly, the purpose of the proposal is to raise loads of money for the state, which has been feeling the pain of the recession in a major way. In his 2009 budget, Gov. David A. Paterson has proposed allowing grocery stores to sell wine as a means of raising money through licensing fees. He also proposed almost tripling the excise tax on wine sold in New York. Grocers, of course, favor the proposal that would allow them to sell wine in their aisles. Mom-and-pop wine and liquor stores are vehemently opposed as they believe it would lead to the eventual demise of the local wine shop. They predict that more than 1,000 of New York’s 2,700 liquor stores would go out of business. In fact, liquor stores are so threatened by the proposal that many owners have, in turn, purportedly threatened local NY wineries with boycotts if they publicly support the proposal. According to a story on Lenndevours, a blog that focuses on local NY wineries, the owner of Fox Run Vineyards in the Finger Lakes received threats after he came out in Albany in support of the bill back in early February. He received the following email from an angry wine shop owner in Troy, NY: I saw you on the news yesterday. Thanks for trying to put me out of business. I used to like pushing your wines but now just looking at them makes me want to puke. I'll never sell any of your wines ever again! When we beat this proposal I hope it's you that goes under. Whether because they felt threatened or otherwise, the vast majority of NY wineries are against Governor Paterson's proposal. A couple of wineries, including Fox Run and Red Newt Cellars in the Finger Lakes, have openly supported the proposal. I personally do not believe that wine in grocery stores will necessarily sound the death knell for local wine and liquor stores. Grocery stores will likely be stocking their shelves with mass-produced wines that will reach more of the masses. As a wine consumer, I can perhaps see myself buying a bottle every now and then in a grocery for convenience sake, but it's not going to change my current wine buying habits, which include online purchases with free shipping, purchases during winery visits and purchases from my local wine shop. This proposal, if passed, would bring wine to the masses in the same way that Wal-Mart and Costco brought flat-screens and other consumer electronics to the masses. Wine shops see what happened to Circuit City and are terrified. However, wine is different than electronics. Unless you are a gizmo or gadget nut, a flat-screen is a flat-screen is a flat-screen. Wine is a much different industry. I think local wine shops can still prosper and even gain market share if they position themselves and stock their shelves correctly. They will need to push their level of service with smart recommendations and procure and sell smaller production wines that don't make it to the grocery stores. While large production wineries are for the proposal in the same way that large grocery stores favor it, small wineries such as NY ones in Long Island and the Finger Lakes are against it. Small production wines need wine shops since groceries will likely not stock their wines due to the price-points. We received an email last night from Red Newt Cellars. David Whiting, winemaker/co-owner of Red Newt, has been in Albany all week listening to the debate and expressed his thoughts on the topic: \"I have been spending some time in Albany for the past few days talking, but mostly listening, to all sides of the very hot issue of permitting the sale of wine in grocery stores. I would like to share some of my thoughts with you on this issue, which holds the potential to be transformational in the economy of upstate New York, and in New York as a whole. One of the points that I will stress is that this is issue is being hotly debated and will likely be decided in a matter of days. If you have an opinion about it, you have the opportunity today to have your voice make a difference. This opportunity will be gone very soon. So act TODAY! (Read more... for some help.) Wine and food go well together and are truly are an example of what I, and many others, consider a healthy, responsible lifestyle. The convenience of being able to walk into a grocery store and purchase a bottle of wine would be very helpful for my family and my customers, and would help boost sales of wine in New York State. But I believe that the question of selling wines in grocery stores is more than just an issue of retail sales. It's not just an issue of who sells more -- the liquor store or the grocery store -- or about who \"wins\". This is an agricultural and economic issue that has holds the future of the NY economy in the balance. Permitting the sales of wine in grocery stores will increase the overall sales of wine in New York State: this effect is very well documented in other states where this has happened. When I talk about boosting wine sales, I'm not just talking about selling more wine to the same group of customers. I'm talking about engaging an expanded set of wine consumers who, when presented with the opportunity and convenience of purchasing wine that is sold along side food, will adopt a routine that involves more frequent enjoyment of the health, social and gustatory benefits that come along with the responsible consumption of wine with their meals. There are two types of sales that are essential to the success of any business. 1) Repeat sales to existing customers and 2) sales to new customers. I do believe that most liquor stores do a good job at culturing loyal customers who find value in the goods and services that they provide. But the fact that nearly 50% of New York State liquor stores have gone out of business in the past 20 years and that the current trend is to lose an additional 50 - 60 stores per year reinforces the idea that there may be a shortage of new customers. If we consider the Farm Wineries of New York, we have seen tremendous growth with the number of wineries from about 150 wineries five years ago to over 260 today. And many of the wineries have shown annual growth in the double digits for the the past decade. In order to do this, we have prioritized our customers, both repeat customers and new customers, and grown an extensive customer base that has created \"pull\" in the retail markets (liquor stores) who carry NY wines. The grocery store setting provides a unique opportunity to present wines to potential consumers in an atmosphere accompanying food, and at a time when that wine can be purchased for direct and immediate involvement in the preparation enjoyment of the meal at hand. Many of the best grocers already embrace the \"eat local\" philosophy and will embrace drinking locally as well. This is a plus, but not the only concern when it comes to marketing NY wines. All wines, regardless of origin, that are sold in this venues will help to build our novice wine drinkers in the food and wine culture, and to create new wine consumers. And, while the sale of NY wines has the biggest economic bang for the buck, wines produced outside of NY still contribute to the suffering NY state economy. That large body of new consumers will not be strangers to the wineries or the liquor stores. Anyone familiar with how people are introduced to and enjoy wine realize that one's taste in wine is anything but static. Invariably the novice wine consumer will be satisfied with a handful of wines that he or she first enjoys for a while. But before long, curiosity and exploration takes hold and leads the consumer to new styles and varieties of wines, and to new outlets. These outlets include the grocery store, the winery, and the wine shop. The economic effects of increased sales by NY wineries is far reaching. It reaches even farther than the obvious scope the wineries and the stores. The growers who grow the grapes, the supplier who sells the tractors, wire, posts. The fabricator who makes the tanks and cellar equipment. The supplier who provides bottles, corks and labels. The list goes on. Increased sales means not only more tax money but more economic prosperity all around. My final point: This issue is being hotly debated in Albany. And the decision will be extremely close. If you have longed for the time that you can express your political voice in a way that is truly heard, the time is now. I would encourage you to at least contact your local legislators (you can use the link below to send an email). But keep in mind, it is not only the representatives of your own district, but all of the legislators that need to hear your voice. Your voice is important, but it does not trickle down the hallways of the capital. Your voice needs to be heard, loud and clear, in each office. There are a lot of people in the capital that value your voice. To make your effort a little more manageable, I'm including a list below of some of the select people who most need to hear what you have to say. Governor Paterson 518-474-8390 Senator Malcolm Smith 518-455-2701 Senator Valesky 518-455-2838 Senator Aubertine 518-455-2761 Senator Stakowski 518-455-2426 Senator Foley 518-455-2303 Assemblyman Magee 518-455-4807 Speaker Silver 518-455-3791 Assemblywoman Christensen 518-455-5383 Assemblyman Parment 518-455-4511 Assemblywoman Lifton 518-455-5444 Assemblyman Canestrari 518-455-4474 Assemblywoman DelMonte 518-455-5284 Assemblywoman Eddington 518-455-4901 Assemblywoman Markey 518-455-4755 Assemblywoman Galef 518-455-5348 Assemblywoman Rosenthal 518-455-5802 Assemblyman Farrell 518-455-5491 Assemblywoman Jacobs 518-455-5385 Assemblyman Schimminger 518-455-4767 Some of the points that you may find important and want to express... *NYS is 3rd in the nation for wine & grape production, but 46th in the nation per capita for the number of outlets to sell wine *Wine in grocery stores does not put liquor stores out of business, in fact in the states that allow it, there are more liquor stores than in NYS *Selling wine in grocery stores will increase sales of wine by creating NEW wine drinkers who will patronize grocery stores, wineries and liquor stores. *35 other states allow the sale of wine in grocery stores. *NYS is the only major grape growing state that does not allow the sale of wine in grocery stores. *The number of liquor stores is decreasing in NYS by 60-80 per year *There are only 2500 liquor stores left in NYS. California has 27,000 outlets to sell wine. North Carolina has 13,072 outlets *Suppliers like tank manufacturers, label printers, bottle distributors, vineyard suppliers are all planning to expand and add jobs if NYS allows the sale of wine in food stores Thanks.

i go down to florida and it's so nice to buy wine in the same stop when we are loading up our condo with groceries. we don't see it here in ny, but they are starting to package wine in all sorts of new and interesting ways...think small formats like you get on airplanes are being sold in 4 and 6-pack fashion as are some smaller type box wines. i even saw a wine that is being sold in what looks like a Capri-Sun pacjage.

We just got a submission about some great specials at Koreatown restaurant and lounge Third Floor Cafe. Expect a dark, lively and loud lounge with a packed elevator ride up and down. Great spot for a group. All-you-can-eat fried chicken and all-you-can-drink beer. Sounds like Koreatown's answer to a Nascar tailgate party. Jill and I have stopped in at a couple of these upstairs lounges in Koreatown and must say that we remember them serving big, potent drinks for about half the price of a typical Manhattan bar. May have to check this place out. Daily, 5pm-8pm $10 for an entree + free drink (wine or martini) On Tuesdays, 5pm-8pm $15 all you can eat and drink (beer) but get there early (before 6pm), otherwise, it's packed.

Despite the damage that Midtown Lunch'ers did when testing out Yushi last week in all-you-can-eat fashion, sleek Midtown sushi spot Omido (designed by AvroKO) is offering an all-you-can-eat sushi special for $29.99 a person on Mondays-Wednesdays between 4-7pm through April 22nd. This deal is in celebration of Omido's 2nd anniversary and because, as Omido itself states, \"a bad economy calls for a great deal.\" For those worried that the special may be limited to all the California rolls you can eat, we've been informed that you can have your pick of anything form nigiri to special rolls like the \"Big Omido.\" There's no doubt that this is a great deal, and though the 4-7pm time seems a bit restrictive, it's ideal for pre-theater given its Broadway b/t 53rd and 54th St. location.

We just got word of this great all-you-can-eat and drink deal from the good folks over at LES restaurant Tre: \"Thanks for the mention in your \"boozy brunch spots\" list! We're offering another great deal that you and your readers may be interested in. After drawing such a crowd with our weekend Unlimited Champagne Brunch, Tre restaurant has decided to extend the fun into the work week with Sangria Mondays! For $19, we offer bottomless bowls of spaghetti and our famous lamb meatballs, served up with an unlimited supply of sangria. (1.5 hour limit) For now, we're offering a classic red sangria, but come warmer weather, we'll be mixing it up with three varieties: Sangria Rosso (red), Bianco (white), and Piccante (spicy). There's nothing like a cool glass (or three, or four...) of sangria to welcome the Spring!

It's the best time of the year to be a sports fan. The Madness has descended upon us and we did a bit of legwork to help you find the right bar to catch all the hoops action.

if you're looking for a midtown bar that has the DirectTv package, don't go to Judge Roy Bean, Cassidy's or Whisky Trader. Best bet is to head to 2nd Ave spots in 50's or Black Finn. Or Johnny Utah's has it supposedly.

It seemed like it would never end. Many had gone as far as dubbing it \"Restaurant Year.\" But the end of Winter today also marks the official end of NYC's Winter Restaurant Week. We're really not that into Restaurant Week anyways to be honest. Unless your talking about a handful of top-tier, high-end restaurants, a $35 three-course prix-fixe is just not that good of a deal. Add a drink or two and then tax + tip and you're still talking $75 a person. If Restaurant Week is your thing, not to worry. Several restaurants are keeping the party going. Here are some of them. L’Absinthe - Extended permanently. Artisanal - Extended through end of 2009 for Lunch, Dinner, Sun Lunch, Sun Dinner. And Artisanal has agreed to offer a Cheese Plate (their bread and butter) as a dessert option. Asia de Cuba - Lunch, Dinner, Sun Dinner through March 31st. Cafe des Artistes - Extending through end of 2009 for Dinner, Sun Lunch, Sun Dinner.Restaurant Week diners can substitute a glass of wine for the dessert course. Center Cut - Extending Sun-Thurs through March 31st. Compass - Extends Restaurant Week menu permanently ($35 prix-fixe). Also extended the $39 3lb lobster special, too. Hudson Cafeteria - Extending Sun-Thurs through March 31st and Lunch Menu Mon-Fri through March 31st. JoJo - Extending $24 lunch/$35 dinner menu through end of 2009. Note that only available for dinner Mon-Fri 5:30-6:30 and again after 9:30 and all Sunday. Kobe Club - Extending Tues-Sat through March 31st. Kittichai - Lunch, Dinner, Sunday Lunch, Sunday Dinner. Extended through March 31, 2009. Oceana - Extended for Lunch and Dinner. through Spring 2009 and maybe longer (including Saturdays). Also have a great wine deal — get 20% off bottles up to $100 and 30% off bottles that are $100 or more. Olana - Extended through end of 2009 for lunch and dinner.

Here's a look at the menu: The Frugal Feast $25 three course menu Appetizer: pickled beets, gorgonzola, toasted pistachios OR “aroma” caesar salad, parmigiano reggiano, poached egg, sicilian anchovy Main: chicken “hamburghese”, royal trumpets, Satur Farms greens OR spaghetti chitarra, fire roasted cherry tomatoes, bottarga, pan grattato OR sicilian meatloaf, herbed polenta, sautéed spinach, red pepper pesto Dessert: gianduja panna cotta, homemade nocciola gelato OR cinnamon raisin bread pudding, citrus whipped cream, cinnamon anglaise SHARETHIS.addEntry({ title: \"Aroma Kitchen & Winebar Introduces \"The Frugal Feast\"\", url: \"http://www.winedanddined.com/2009/03/aroma-kitchen-nyc-special/\" });

Thrillist writes today that a Gansevoort Hotel has just opened in Turks & Caicos. A visit to the website reveals that the hotel's restaurant and beach club is none other than Bagatelle, the Meatpacking District brunch spot that's known to get bumpin' on Saturdays. The hotel's spa services are provided by Exhale Spa. This follows the opening of a Nikki Beach Resort in Turks & Caicos early last year. Isn't the whole point of going on vacation to get away from New York?

It's my favorite time of the year! St. Patty's Day and the NCAA Tournament in the same week...it just doesn't get any better than this. Not to mention the fact that my Michigan Wolverines made the tourney for the first time since I was a senior there (1998). I'm not sure which bothers me more -- that Michigan's basketball program was in the toilet for so long OR that it's already been 11 years since I graduated college. And just when you're thinkin' March can't get any better, we get word from friend and beer aficionado Riki about The National IPA Championship. An IPA tournament with 64 entries and a bracket -- are you kidding me! This is genius. The tournament began back on February 22nd and is already down to the Final Four. Click here for the current bracket. Here's how the tourney is set up: 64 participating IPA's from across the nation were randomly selected (some ones you've likely heard of such as Stone IPA, Dogfish Head, Magic Hat HIPA, and Bear Republic Racer 5 as well as several regional IPA's you probably haven't ever come across); All judges are brewers. They are organized into panels of 3, and given the task of choosing the best IPA between two beers. The judges do not know what beers they are being served. The majority rules on the voting. A steward will serve the panel the two beers (Sample \"Alpha\" and Sample \"Beta\"). The beers are served in clean, small cylindrical glasses. Each sample will be a 3 ounce pour. Once the preferred IPA is chosen, the panel will move to the next sample. No panel will judge more than eight pairs. At the completion of the judging session, the names of the beers are revealed to the panels and audience at large. One thing Riki noticed in looking at the bracket after a couple of rounds is that many of her favorites (which coincidentally happen to be many of my favorites) were getting knocked out of the tourney early by relatively unknown IPA's, or \"cinderallas\". So Riki and her friend Kelly decided to set up a mini-tournament and made it their mission to locate some of the winning beers (many of which are very small production and not at all easy to get a hold of ) so they could determine for themselves whether they are really \"winners.\" In Riki's own words, \"Tracking these beers down proved quite difficult and in the end we found 2 that made it to the final 4, 1 that made it to the final 8 and 3 that made it to the final 16. To round out the numbers we are also adding to our mini-tournament 2 of our favorites. This Saturday afternoon we will engage in a blind tasting tournament of our 8 beers to determine which one we like best. Please join us and aid in the judging process. We are making this an afternoon drinking activity and expect to start the competition around 2:30 or 3pm.\" In fact, four of the beers are being shipped from a distributor in Oregon and are expected to arrive Friday. We'll keep our fingers crossed. We're pretty psyched to be taking part in this little tasting tourney and we'll keep you posted on our winners. The Championship Round of the actual tournament is taking place here in NYC on Saturday.

When we first learned that Bloomingdale's was set to open an upscale burger joint called 'Flip' we wrote in a post titled \"Richard Blais is Gonna 'Flip'!\" back on Feb. 20th that we may have another one of those legal name battles on our hands. Blais had been hinting of an NYC location since July 2008. Just in case Blais and the team behind his Flip Burger Boutique in Atlanta hadn't heard the news, we also left the following comment on Blais' blog, TrailBlais, back on Feb. 20th: Wined & Dined said... If NYC is one of the locations slated for your expansion, you may need to do some proactive trademark and trade name protection. I just read the following earlier today about a \"Flip Burger\" opening up soon in Bloomingdale's: (from website Eater) Surely enough, Grub Street reported Monday here that Blais' attorneys are looking into the situation. Apparently, Bloomingdales hasn't applied for a trademark and Blais' Flip has. Not only should Flip Bloomingdales be made to change their name, they should also change their absurdly expensive prices and asinine policies ($15 min per person during lunch) while they're at it.

SUSHISAMBA Offers James Beard Menu to Public

Some of NYC's best chefs are hosting multi-course dinners with wine pairings at the James Beard House throughout 2009. Last week it was SUHSISAMBA's turn with its chefs from NYC, Miami and Vegas showing up for the occasion. Later this month, Ryan Skeen of Irving Mill will be hosting a \"Pig and Pinot Feast\" at James Beard ($125 for members, $165 for public, ticket info here). According to the JBF website, Skeen has composed a pig-centric menu of signature dishes to be paired with a bold selection of Pinot Noirs from around the world. Sounds like a pretty good sequel to Cochon 555 for all you pork-ophiles. SUSHISAMBA informed us yesterday that its SUSHISAMBA park location (245 Park Avenue South) will be offering an exclusive prix-fixe menu created by their chefs and inspired by their recent dinner at the James Beard House. The five course menu (see after the jump) will be $80 per person and $110 per person with wine and sake pairings. In addition, SUSHISAMBA will be offering a special promotion for the month of March.

We are headed to Brazil tonight to wine and dine our way through Buzios and Rio de Janeiro. We plan on enjoying lots of caipirinhas (heavy on the cachaca) and we will certainly try out all the local flavors. We'll hit up as many churrascarias, comida a quilos, and beachside kiosks as our stomachs can handle. If you have any insider tips or places we shouldn't miss, please let us know!

We'll be continuously updating this list as comments come in with new ones. We also list the restaurants doing 2+ complimentary brunch cocktails and the 1-complimentary brunch cocktail spots.

Just an FYI- Nero is now ala carte, no more unlimited... and listen to these prices, $14 for 1 mimosa, bloody mary, etc, or you can get a pitcher for $100! We didn't stay long enough to ask if that pitcher was a 5 gallon bucket, but quite a change from the unlimited deal. -Oh and it was empty at noon on a sunny saturday, 3 people were there discussing how they were eating quick and then going elsewhere, no drinks. -We went around the corner to Paradou and sat in their great garden space, perfect! They were packed but were able to squeeze us in even without a res.

Irving Mill Announces New \"Sunday Supper\"

Just read on Serious Eats that Irving Mill has announced a Sunday Supper special that includes \"Dale’s Pale Ale Beer-Can Chicken\" as one of the main courses, along with salad, soup, and cupcakes for $60. And we just learned from Zagat Buzz that the Sunday Supper menu is even more extensive than we thought. Click here for the full menu. Add this to Irving Mill's Monday night Burger + Sixpoint Beer for $15 special. Lots of people have been pretty critical of restaurants that are just blindly throwing out special after special with little or no thought. It's good to see places like Irving Mill that are putting time, energy and creativity into coming up with compelling specials. A few others who are doing it right include Craftsteak with its \"Halfsteak\", Beacon with its \"60-Day Stimulus Package\" and Dovetail with its Sunday Suppa. Just heard from Irving Mill that they are also offering 2-for-1 cans of Dale's Pale Ale and Snapperhead IPA on Sunday nights. Sweet!

The Harrison: Offering certain bottles of wine at cost on Monday nights (3 for $15, 3 for $20 and 3 for $25) Jean-Georges Restaurants: \"Half-Glass\" Wine Special means you pay half the cost of a normal glass and get a generous half-sized glass of wine Kampuchea: Every Sunday get 50% off any bottle of wine with dinner Kyotofu: 50% off of all sake glasses and bottles on Sundays The Modern: Every bottle of wine in the Bar Room is now $50 or less New York City Restaurant Group Restaurants: Party like it's $19.99 for 2009 Special.

Thanks lesider. We'll add that one to the list. Wonder if they've reduced the price of the $175 Richard Nouveau Burger -- the foie gras, shaved truffle bomb.

As anyone who has dined with me on a few occasions must know, I have a slight obsession with great brussels sprouts. Maybe that's because they are so often roasted or caramelized and served with pork, such as bacon, pancetta and pork fat, and/or a hearty, savory cheese... vegetables just don't get any better. I have had quite a few amazing brussels sprout sides in NYC and I will list my favorites below, but have I had the best? I have listed my top five faves and ones that I have been told I must try, but if I am missing any of the city's best leafy green buds (I'm talking mini cabbages here), please do send me in the right direction. My Top 5 Favorites: 1. Momofuku Ssam Bar (207 2nd Ave. at 13th St.): Satur Farm's fried brussels sprouts with mint, scallions, fish sauce vinaigrette. Pictured above courtesy of Marc Shepherd with New York Journal 2. Babbo (110 Waverly Place btw MacDougal and 6th Ave.): Brussels sprouts with pancetta. 3. mia dona (206 E. 58th btw 2nd and 3rd): Roasted brussels sprouts with pecorino and pancetta. 4. Wildwood Barbeque (255 Park Ave. South @ 18th): Brussels sprouts with sweet onions and bacon. 5. The Smith (55 3rd Ave. btw 10th and 11th): Caramelized brussels sprouts (sans pork but crispy and tasty) 5 Other Popular Picks I Have Yet to Try: 1. Alta (64 W. 10th St. btw 5th and 6th Ave.): Crispy brussels sprouts with fuji apples, crème fraiche, and pistachio nuts. 2. Casa Mono (52 Irving Place @ 17th St.): Brussels sprouts a la plancha. 3. Blue Hill (75 Washington Pl. btw. MacDougal and 6th Ave.): Brussels sprouts and pistachios. 4. Park Avenue Winter (100 E. 63rd St. @ Park Ave.): Brussels sprouts and roasted apples. 5. Lupa (170 Thompson St. btw Houston and Bleeker): Brussels sprouts with pecorino.

I was just at Chestnut in Carroll Gardens and they had maple brussel sprouts that were glorious.

FYI...Overcooking releases the sulphur smelling glucosinolate, sinigrin. This is the reason many people profess to dislike Brussels sprouts. That said, there is nothing better than a perfectly cooked sprout. I too prefer roasting as they seem to suck up all that grilling flavor.

Jean-Georges' Glass is Half-Full

***CONTENT
Jean-Georges introduced a 4-course $58 dinner menu a couple of weeks back at his NYC flagship. As he describes on his blog, \"It’s a four course meal of three of my favorite dishes and your choice of a dessert flight.\" As expected, there are time and date restrictions for this $58 prix-fixe -- Monday through Thursday from 5:30-6pm and again from 10-11pm. His explanation for the rather tight and rather diner-unfriendly timeframes, \"Those are my favorite hours in the dining room, when you can see the sun setting over Central Park and when you can feel the night vibe of the city starting to heat up.\" I doubt Steve Cuozzo would buy this. In connection with this new prix-fixe deal, Jean-Georges also announced that all of his restaurants would be offering \"half-glasses\" of wine. I actually find this more intriguing than the unnecessarily time-restrictive $58 prix-fixe deal. The half-glasses are \"half the price of a full glass\" (think \"Halfsteak\") and allow you \"to taste a lot of great wines without breaking the bank.\" I would say this is Jean-Georges' answer to \"Halfsteak\", but he insists these half-glass \"tastes\" have been offered since October. Jean-Georges list of reasons for the half-glass program make a lot of sense. From Jean-Georges blog post: \"I noticed that people getting together at the bar would start with a glass of wine, and then be stuck in the awkward position of wanting to stay a little while longer, but not for another full glass. (Think first dates.) In the dining room, customers wanted to pair different wines with different courses, but didn’t want a full glass with each course. And colleagues who came in for lunch celebrations would want to order champagne, but a full glass is a bit much when you need to return to work. (In these times, it’s more important than ever to celebrate professional achievements.) Perhaps most importantly, I wanted diners who drove to my restaurants to drive home safely. My beverage director, Bernard Sun, constantly changes the wine lists at all of my New York restaurants to feature the best wines of the times. And he chooses the most interesting and delicious ones for our wines by the glass and half glass. In addition to sourcing unique wines from top producers around the world, he also chooses wines appropriate to the seasons and our changing menus. That’s the real reason I like our half glasses—you can taste a lot of great wines without breaking the bank. (It’s a great deal because these half glasses are half the price of a full glass.)

Wined & Dined Launches 'NYC Recession Dining Guide'

Wining & Dining in NYC has never been more within reach. Here is your one-stop guide for NYC's Recession Specials. We have broken down the city's best eating and drinking deals into categories such as specials by neighborhood, cuisine, day of the week, and more. So, without further ado: Specials By Day of the Week: Restaurants are offering great deals on the slower nights of the week like Sunday, Monday and Tuesday. Sunday nights are becoming a popular BYO night with restaurants that typically charge a corkage fee. And then there's Dovetail's \"Sunday Suppa\" that we continue to hear great things about. Winter Restaurant Week Extensions, Menus & Related Deals: Winter Restaurant Week has been extended yet again. This time through March 20th. Its' not officially \"Restaurant Year\" yet, but it's getting pretty darn close to it. In fact, several restaurants aren't waiting around and have already announced that their Restaurant Week menu will be offered all year long. Some include L'Absinthe, Cafe des Artistses, Compass, Le Cirque (wine lounge) and the Jean-Georges restaurants. Wine-Friendly Specials: Wine deals are everywhere these days. Some restaurants are even offering free bottles of wine on certain nights and at certain times (Philip Marie and Paradou). Several restaurants are offering anywhere between 30-50% off bottles of wine. Which kind of makes you wonder how crazy the mark-ups are when the economy isn't hurting. Restaurants can still make a pretty good margin even when giving 50% off their listed price. Some wine deals can be found at Brasserie and Brasserie 8 1/2, Beacon and Oceana, just to name a few. Boozy Brunch Specials: There's nothing better than a great-tasting, booze-filled weekend brunch, and no other city does brunch quite like New York. Here are our favorite places to hit up on Sunday \"Fun-Day\" and some ideas for brunch spots for every occasion. Top-Rated Specials (Coming Soon): It's not just the casual restaurants that are offering unbelievable deals, but some of NYC's top dining destinations are as well. Think Del Posto, Cru, Jean-Georges, Daniel, Le Cirque and many others. Here we'll break them down by value and Zagat ratings. Burger + Beer Specials (Coming Soon): 2009 is the year of the \"Comfort Food\" and it doesn't get any more comfortbale than a burger and a beer. Here will highlight all the restaurants and bars offering Burger + Beer Specials. Happy Hour Specials (Coming Soon): Happy Hour is gaining popularity as more and more people find themselves in a bar between 4-8pm and not in the office (if they still have an office). Happy Hour specials are everywhere and we'll do our best to bring as many of them as possible to your attention. Prix-Fixe Specials (Coming Soon) Recession Specials Disguised as Anniversary Specials (Coming Soon) Stock Market Based Specials (Coming Soon): Restaurants and bars around the city are getting creative with their recession specials. Paradou is offering a free bottle of wine the first Monday of every month until the market hits 12,000 again (this deal may go til 2020) and Sandro's is also offering a unique stock market special. Steakhouse Recession Specials (Coming Soon): With the financial industry in shambles, steakhouses are feeling the pain, too. No more power lunches and closing dinners. Lots of big-time NYC steakhouses are offering great deals.

Food & Drink Event: A Conversation on Culinary Authenticity and the SUSHISAMBA Experience

***CONTENT
SUSHISAMBA is continuing to celebrate the ten month countdown to its 10-Year Anniversary by hosting 'Redefining the Roll,' a one-of-a-kind culinary experience. Wednesday, March 4th from 6 pm to 8:30 pm, SUSHISAMBA 7 (87 Seventh Avenue South, 212.691.7885) invites guests to its rooftop to meet Executive Chefs from all SUSHISAMBA locations (New York, Chicago, Miami and Las Vegas) for a Chef’s Panel hosted by renowned author and food critic, Bob Lape. The special night of food, drink and conversation includes a discussion of culinary authenticity and how it applies to the successful SUSHISAMBA concept. In addition, guests will be served select SUSHISAMBA dishes as well as signature cocktails. Tickets are available at the SUSHISAMBA 7 restaurant for $45. For the past five years, the concept of 'culinary authenticity' has been a topic of intrigue for gastronomes, chefs and scholars alike. In cities where international flavors are on every corner and a delivery call away - how have cultures been able to maintain the 'tradition' of their cuisine? Is Chinese food eaten in Chinatown as authentic as Chinese food eaten in Beijing? Is 'authenticity' specified in the quality of ingredients and the execution of a precise recipe - or by a restaurant’s geographic location and the ethnicity of the chef preparing the cuisine? What does it mean for a dish to be 'Americanized' when America has long been the melting pot of all cultures and cuisines? Today, every 'international' restaurant contends with philosophies on authenticity, the judgment of well-traveled (or not so well-traveled) patrons and culinary stereotypes. As they approach their 10 Year Anniversary, SUSHISAMBA reflects on the evolution of their Japanese, Brazilian and Peruvian concept. Is a fusion restaurant void of authenticity because it blends the tastes and traditions of multiple cultures, essentially creating an entirely new cuisine? Or, is the creative fusion of these cuisines actually more 'authentic' in today's age, given the current and historic merging of the Japanese, Brazilian and Peruvian cultures? SUSHISAMBA hopes to answer these questions and many more at their first ever Chef’s Panel. Bob Lape is an Emmy Award-winning member of Who’s Who in America and has had a powerful impact on the way Americans eat at home and away. He has sampled more than 13,000 restaurants around the world. His publications, programs and pronouncements span the past 39 years. As the pioneering restaurant reviewer for Crain’s New York Business, a post he occupies 24 years later, and as a similar ground-breaker for the New York Law Journal, he brought careful assessments of dining possibilities to the most discriminating audiences. His daily “Dining Diary” feature on the CBS Flagship radio station in New York, aired 21 times a week, is in its 25th year. He is married to the cookbook author, food and travel writer/consultant Joanna Pruess and lives in the Bronx, NY. Both make frequent television appearances, often about their book, Seduced by Bacon, now in its fifth printing. SUSHISAMBA offers inventive fare that unites bold Brazilian flavors, precise Japanese technique and traditional Peruvian culinary traditions on one plate. The growing restaurant group has recently opened its newest outpost in Las Vegas at The Palazzo Hotel and Casino Resort. Please see www.sushisamba.com for more information about this dynamic restaurant group.

In the \"not a shocker\" category, we learned over the weekend that 130+ restaurants have agreed to extend Restaurant Week through March 20th. Why the 20th instead of the entire month, we're not excactly sure. We'll find out and let you know. Some restaurants are extending into new meals and times. For example, you can now order RW Menu for dinner at Bar Boulud. Also, notably absent from the list of extensions are all of the B.R. Guest restaurants, i.e. Dos Caminos, Primehouse, Atlantic Grill, etc. SushiSamba also chose not to extend. We hear though that B.R. Guest and SushiSamba have their own specials coming soon. Like the $12.95 Sun/Mon Pasta + Wine Deal @ Vento. Other restaurants that have opted out of RW are crossed through below. Click on the restaurant name for the RW Menu (if available).

Breakfast is starting to get a lot more interesting. Today marks the day that Starbuck's $3.95 breakfast values begin and Jamba Juice is responding by launching a $1 oatmeal special with a dowloadable coupon. Get yours here. Served with a brown-sugar crumble and a choice of three fruit toppings, Jamba Juice’s oatmeal is made with organic steel-cut oats and typically sells for a suggested price of $2.95. “This economy has an effect on everybody,” said James White, Jamba’s chief executive. “Jamba Juice is always looking to bring customers high-quality menu items that fit into their lifestyle and budget. You can’t get anything for a buck these days, let alone a slow-cooked, delicious, wholesome meal.” SHARETHIS.addEntry({ title: \"The 'Jamba Economic Boost Plan': Jamba Juice Offers Oatmeal for a $1 Starting Today\", url: \"http://www.winedanddined.com/2009/03/the-jamba-economic-boost-plan-jamba-juice-offers-oatmeal-for-a-1-starting-today/\" });

***CONTENT
An idea conceived in 2000 by wine writers Dorothy Gaiter and John Brecher of the Wall Street Journal, Open That Bottle Night (OTBN) encourages wine enthusiasts worldwide to open and share a special bottle of wine. Due to its popularity, OTBN became an annual celebration held in homes and restaurants nationwide on the last Saturday of February. According to the website, \"Every year since 2000, on a special Saturday night in February, friends, couples and groups around the world get together to enjoy particular bottles of wine, champagne and spirits. The bottle that you enjoy, traditionally, is one that you have been saving for some special event that, so far, has never quite happened.\" Twitter Taste Live, an online wine tasting forum, is covering the event and you can log on to participate in real-time. Jill and I had our own little \"Open That Bottle Night\" back on V-Day when we popped a 1982 Chateau Lascombes. We'll be at Carmine's tomorrow night for brother-in-law Jonathan's 40th B-day Bash...and yes, we'll be drinking lots of wine. Let us know what you open!

Finding Beer Nirvana @ Back Forty's Sixpoint Mardi Gras Feast
***AUTHOR
Andy
***DATE
2009-02-26 19:08:00
***CONTENT
After polishing off a couple of pints, including a Delirium Tremens and a Duvel Green, at Belgian beer bar BXL Cafe near Times Square (just learned a new location is slated for 51st b/t 2nd and 3rd), we headed down to Back Forty in the E. Village with our beer-loving friend Martin for the Sixpoint Mardi Gras Fat Tuesday Feast. And what a feast it was. Jill and I love Sixpoint Craft Ales and were excited to introduce some of our favorites in their repertoire to Martin. Sixpoint has been celebrating its 5th anniversary throught this month with events all over Brooklyn and Manhattan. We were a bit early for our reservation so we found seats at the bar. The first thing we noticed was that pretty much every tap at Back Forty is a different Sixpoint beer. Since we were there for the dinner the bartender poured us each an amuse bouche of Sixpoint Brownstone from cask -- a nice semi-creamy brown ale with a nut and malt taste. Next, Martin and I moved on to my favorite Sixpoint beer, the Bengali IPA, while Jill ordered a Belgian Rye-PA from the other cask. We didn't know at the time this is the only cask of this beer in the world. Turns out it was one of the best beers I've ever tasted. Completely my style of beer. The aromas alone rocked my world -- strong hops blending nicely with some citrus and malty sweetness on the nose. We got to speak with Jeff Gorlechen by the bar for a few minutes before getting seated. Jeff handles promotion for Sixpoint, and he explained more about this insane Belgian Rye and how there are only between 50-100 pours left in the cask and then it would be gone forever. When he saw that we all had one in front of us, he quickly had the bartender pour him one seeming to doubt whether there was really as much left in the cask as he thought. We were taken back past the bar and kitchen to our table. We were seated with our beerphile friends, Charles, Phil and Kelly, and a couple of their friends. The first course was shrimp hush puppies (see full menu at end), which were delicious. They were not at all shy with the Sixpoint beer bringing us pitcher after pitcher throughout the evening. It was supposed to be a different Sixpoint beer paired with each course, but since they were so generous with the pitchers, I think we just about had a pitcher of all the Sixpoint beers on our table at several points during the meal. Not that we were complaining, though. At one point, Martin got up and went to the bar and came back with a Belgian Rye from the cask for everyone at the table. Over the course of the night, we had the Righteous Ale, more Bengali IPA, Apollo Wheat, and Dubbel Trubbel with dessert. The food was ridiculously good. The housemade sausage for the second course had great seasoning and the shrimp in the third course jambalaya was unreal. Towards the end of the evening we got to chat for a while with Sixpoint brewer Craig Frymark, who we had met back on Super Bowl Sunday at a Sixpoint tasting and growler event at Whole Foods Bowery Beer Room. He shared a ton of info about Sixpoint and his own beer-making experiences, and we're hoping to have a Q&A with Craig on Wined & Dined in the near future. Here's the full menu from the feast: MARDI GRAS BEER FEAST WITH SIXPOINT CRAFT ALES Fat Tuesday Beer and Louisiana Style Dinner Red Maine Shrimp Hush Puppies Coated in Cajun Spices and served with a Creole Honey Butter House Made Boudin served with Creole Mustard Sauce, and Spicy Crawfish Bread Jambalaya with House Made Andouille and Gulf Shrimp Trippple Chocolate Bread Pudding SHARETHIS.addEntry({ title: \"Finding Beer Nirvana @ Back Forty's Sixpoint Mardi Gras Feast\", url: \"http://www.winedanddined.com/2009/02/finding-beer-nirvana-back-fortys-sixpoint-mardi-gras-feast/\" });

Recession Taking Massive Toll on MePa
***AUTHOR
Andy
***DATE
2009-02-26 15:32:00
***CONTENT
Though we have no consumer surveys, stats or reports to back this up, it appears that restaurants and bars in the Meatpacking District are suffering even more than others during these tough economic times. And the reason seems fairly obvious enough. MePa is dominated by tourists hailing from outside New York, businessmen on expense accounts, and scenesters. The deep recession means far less tourists, far fewer businessmen (if any) maxing out their expense accounts, and many scenesters now find themselves unemployed and cashless. New Yorkers have for the most part been avoiding MePa for years and have taken refuge in areas like the E. Village, LES and Tribeca. It also appears that people are eating out more in their own neighborhood to avoid taxi fares. Not too many people around the city seem all that interested in now patronizing the big, uber-expensive \"chi-chi\" MePa restaurants that used to only offer them 5:30pm or 10:30pm reservations in favor of the trendy, euro-tourist types. Also everyone seems to be looking for a little comfort these days and those MePa restaurants are the antithesis of \"comfort\" dining. Those places that used to shun people are now pining for them...oh, the ironies of a recession. Here's some circumstantial evidence of MePa's demise: - Level V has closed - Rumor has it that Merkato 55 is soon to be extinct (they have been offering 15% off your entire check through a site called DiningFever -- which has sounded the death knell for several restaurants) - Plunge and Ono are offering pretty much everything on their menus, including cocktails, for $7 b/t 6-8pm on Mon-Fri - Del Posto has more deals than we can keep up with - STK is offering 50% wine by the bottle and glass on Monday nights - Paradou has a full web page of Recession Specials - 5 Ninth is offering a $24 3-course lunch and great happy hour deals (including free pigs in blanket) SHARETHIS.addEntry({ title: \"Recession Taking Massive Toll on MePa\", url: \"http://www.winedanddined.com/2009/02/recession-meatpacking-district/\" });

\"Recession Review\" by 89th and Broke: Choice Kitchen's $10 Burger + Fries + Beer Deal

***CONTENT
\"Recession Reviews\" is a weekly feature by website 89th and Broke of a great eating and/or drinking deal in NYC. Now I’m not saying it can’t be beat, but Choice Kitchen is definitely offering one of the better burger deals in Manhattan: a burger, fries and beer for $10…oh yeah, and the food is really good too. There's a compilation of other burger and beer specials here. From the rave reviews of bloggers and critics alike, it sounds like Irving Mill’s Monday night burger, beer and fries special for $15 is a phenomenal deal. However, I haven’t tried it yet so I can’t make any solid comparisons. On to the quality of the food… What can I say? I really enjoyed it. I had the burger with goat cheese (my favorite) and caramelized onions (another favorite) - bacon also came with it but I opted out - and my beer of choice was Blue Point. My friend Abi had a more standard burger with lettuce and tomato, and a Magic Hat. The burgers were big, so big that neither of us could finish, and juicy. The fries were pretty thickly cut, although not quite as thick as steak fries, and they were browned and seasoned - delicious. Again, the portion was so large that we couldn’t finish the fries either. A few things to note: a) there are only three burger and three beer options b) there are no turkey or veggie burgers on the menu, which disappointed us. However, we didn’t ask if there were any available as substitutions (just not listed on the menu), so we can’t say for certain if you can get them or not c) double check your bill to make sure that you were charged just $10 for the meal - they don’t have an automatic option/button in the system for this deal yet, so they have to remember to go back and change it. The place itself was cute. Nothing special, but nice nonetheless. And we had a really nice waiter, which always makes for a pleasant dining experience. Abi and I ate late, around 9 pm, so the place was pretty empty, although I’m not sure how busy it is during happy hour and earlier dining hours. What I loved about this deal was the price savings. The burgers and fries alone typically cost $12-13, but you get that PLUS a beer for LESS than the original price of your meal - sounds pretty good to me! If you’re a burger and beer kind of person, and you’re in the Murray Hill/Gramercy area, then you should definitely do yourself a favor and check out Choice Kitchen’s Monday night special. Choice Kitchen is offering some pretty impressive specials throughout the week, and I’m excited to try those out as well. Please let us know if you have! The Basics Name: Choice Kitchen Location: 380 3rd Avenue between 26th and 27th Streets, East side of the street Who to take: Friends, Co-workers, Anyone Price: $ Even a homeless guy could afford this special. Overall: Become a regular. 5 Stars.

interesting that almost all the burger deals are on sunday and monday nights. wonder if has anything to do with when places get their ground beef shipments and they're looking to get rid of meat en masse. is there a meat equivalent to not eating sushi on sunday nights??

impressed with the beer selections even though only 4. i like magic hat (wonder if it's the #9) and also blue point (probably the toasted lager). makes deal much better than if it were miller lite or bud light.

Well B.R. Guest's Vento in the MPD (Hudson @ 14th) just announced a great Alcohol-Friendly \"Recession Special\". Every Sunday and Monday night Vento is offering a pizza or pasta + a glass of house wine or 12oz beer for only $12.95! This one's hard to beat. You know where you can find us come Sunday night.

Paradou Just May Be NYC's Most Recession-Friendly Restaurant

Well, we just got through telling you all the ways that new burger joint Flip in Bloomies is the most Recession-Unfriendly restaurant we have yet to come across. To balance things out we thought we would highlight what we've found to easily be one of the most Recession-Friendly restaurants in NYC -- Paradou in the MPD (Little W. 12th @ 9th Ave). Paradou is a french bistro that has one of our favorite year-round gardens in the city. In addition to the AYCD Brunch on Saturday's and Sunday's that they have always offered, where $29 gets you unlimited bellinis, mimosas, kir royales, etc and a menu item, Paradou has been offering several creative and outstanding \"Recession Specials\". We love their descriptions of the special offers which show that Paradou really gets it and understands what people are going through these days. Here is a sampling of Paradou's February \"Recession Specials\" in their own words: EVERY SUNDAY NIGHT: THREE COURSES FOR THE PRICE OF ONE!!! Sunday night. End of the weekend. Night before work starts. You want to relax. You don't want to cook but you don't want to spend alot of money either. We feel the same way. That's why we're starting 2009 with this wonderful special.

A Look at Flip in Bloomingdale's: How Recession Un-Friendly Can You Possibly Be?

A Hamburger Today brings us a closer look at Flip, the new burger joint that opened yesterday in Bloomingdale's mid level of the lower level men's store. And I'm glad they did because now I don't have to waste my time or money checking it out for myself. So let me set the stage for you -- we are in one of the deepest recessions in recent history, people are eating out less and looking for great deals when they do eat out, and restaurants at all levels are offering terrific specials to get customers in the door...and then there's Flip in Bloomingdale's. While the Pat LaFrieda mixes are nice and it seems like they have interesting sauces on the side, here's a look at why Flip is the epitome of the Anti-\"Recession Special.\" (1) Customers are greeted by a \"Please Wait to Be Seated\" sign that informs them of a $15 per person minimum at all the tables between 12-3:30pm. C'mon, this is a burger joint we're talking about. It's not in a place like the Ritz or Four Seasons. It's Bloomingdale's where they can't even give their clothes away these days! In a couple of weeks, my guess is they'll be happy if someone orders a bottled water. (2) While restaurants with great burgers all over the city are offering fantastic burger + beer specials (think Irving Mill's Monday Night Burger + Sixpoint Beer for $15 and lots of other B+B specials here), a bacon cheeseburger + a beer at Flip will set you back $22 (not including tax, tip or fries). If you want fries, then it's $27... (3) Which brings us to, a side of fries is $5. (4) Iced Tea and Lemonade are $4. (5) A freakin' milk shake is $7 (or $8 if you want malt). Save your money and calories and get a fro-yo from Forty Carrots upstairs. (6) An extra side sauce is $1.50. To put this into perspective, you can get a Peter Luger Bacon Cheeseburger w/ fries for $16.50. To me, Flip is just the next Obika. Once the hype is gone, nobody's gonna give a you-know-what about this place unless the burgers are just mind-blowingly good. And from early reviews it sounds like they're just above average. Flip is a slap in the face to budget-conscious New Yorkers. Hey Richard Blais - I am begging you to bring the original Flip Burger to NYC! Save us from this mess!

first of all, its bloomies ppl!!!!!!!!!!! this aint the 99 cent store!!!!!!!!!! the burgers are pretty damn good, the service is outstanding, from the hostesses and the bartender to the waitresses. the funniest thing i found was the bartender was the only male in the restaurant at the time and the manager it looked like, which i loved and we had a good laugh about it.

i don't care if it's bergdorf goodman or bendel, those prices are insane for a burger/fries and an insult to people during these economic times. it doesn't make sense -- the same store that is selling clothes at 50-70% off is on the other hand marking up burgers, fries and milkshakes by 800-1000%.

Huge Carnaval Party Tomorrow Night @ SUSHISAMBA

Tomorrow night should in theory be a HUGE party night in the city. On the one hand it's Mardi Gras Fat Tuesday, which means tons of drink specials at bars and restaurants across the city. On the other hand it's the last day of Carnaval in Brazil, which is one of the biggest party scenes in the world. We're actually heading to Brazil (Rio de Janeiro and Buzios) in less than 2 weeks, so we were pretty excited to see that the NYC SUSHISAMBA locations are throwing a massive Carnaval celebration tomorrow night, Feb. 24th. In addition to the special Brazilian menu (see full menu at end), samba dancers, live drummers, and DJ's, the restaurants will also be celebrating the 10 month kick-off to SUSHISAMBA's 10-year anniversary. I'm guessing there will be some big Anniversary Specials in the coming months from SUSHISAMBA. In fact, each month between now and November someone will win a $500 SUSHISAMBA gift certificate and two tickets to SUSHISAMBA’s NYC Anniversary Party in November. The 10 winners will then be eligible for a free trip for two to Brazil. I wouldn't mind going back again. In addition to the entertainment, passed aperitivos, and signature Brazilian cocktails, there will be tons of giveaways tomorrow night. A few winners will receive roundtrip airfare and luxury hotel accommodations in NYC. Here's a little secret for how to win the first $500 gift certificate and anniversary party tix: ask any staff member for the secret password. The tenth person to email sambaservice@sushisamba.com with the secret word will be declared the lucky winner! Carnaval 2009 Specials: \"Bossanova\" Roll $14 farofa crusted tiger shrimp, torched pineapple, avocado & toasted coconut sushi rice \"Salada de Palmito\" $16 Hearts of palm, papaya, king crab, caipirinha vinaigrete & candied cashews \"Peixe Frito\" $26 Cocacabana beach style fried whole fish, lime, chiles & cilantro \"Lietoa Pururuca de Paulista\" $32 crispy suckling pig, torresmo & tangerines with brazilian beans and rice Carnaval Cocktail Recipe $12 1.5 oz Cabana cachaca 2 whole strawberries (each cut in half) Two pinches of cinnamon One pinch of cayenne pepper 1 tbl of honey 1 oz lemon juice Muddle cinnamon, strawberries, cayenne pepper and honey in a glass.

With the already-extended Restaurant Week winding down (slated to end February 27th), Wined & Dined is reaching out to NYC restaurants, including the Restaurant Week participants, to see which ones are interested in becoming a part of “Restaurant Year.” We will list all the restaurants that extend for one week, one month, the rest of the year or even until the Dow reaches 10,000 again. They make the call. Several, including Le Cirque, Kobe Club, Cafe des Artistes and L'Absinthe already have. Restaurants can either simply extend their ongoing Restaurant Week menu or come up with a new special menu deal altogether. Wined & Dined is also looking for restaurants to participate in a \"Let's Get Through $20.09 Together!\" special. We will specially feature all restaurants who agree to offer customers the choice of either an entrée + alcoholic beverage for $20.09 OR an appetizer + entrée for $20.09 OR an entrée + dessert for $20.09. We will be your source for all the information on restaurants that will be extending (or have already extended) their specially-priced menus past February 27th. We will post menus and provide the days and times that the special deals will be offered. SHARETHIS.addEntry({ title: \"Why Stop Now?

It's no longer the \"off-the-menu\" Greek Salad w/ Grilled Chicken at 100% Halal & Healthy (55th & Park), which Midtown Lunch refers to as \"may be the only salad I'll eat\" in Midtown. As of last week, the 100% Halal & Healthy cart has a new look and a new menu (click pic). It still claims to be \"Low Fat & Low Cholesterol\" though the jury's still out on that. Menu items have been \"spell-checked\" and now include the hugely popular Greek Salad w/ Grilled Chicken, a Caesar Salad w/ Grilled Chicken, Grilled Chicken Breast Kabobs, a Hummus Sandwich, a Veggie Wrap, a Kofta Sandwich on Pita, and a Combo w/ Grilled Chicken, Lamb and Kofta over rice. Not on the permanent menu yet, but still being offered indefinitely is Gamal's entry in the Midtown Lunch Sandwich Challenge - the $5 Gino Sandwich. W&D helped Gamal with this sandwich creation that people so far have been raving about (see comments here). The \"Gino\" includes a combination of grilled chicken and kofta, feta cheese (or American), grilled onions, hot peppers and hot/white sauce on a pita. And if you want to change things up a bit, Gamal also owns the food cart on 54th and Park which has a completely different menu. We'll give it a try and let you know what we think.

A Casual Night Out With Friends at Almond

In Oct. of '08, childhood friends Eric Lemonides and Jason Weiner brought their French-influenced American Bistro fare from Almond in Bridgehampton and Almoncello in Wainscott to the Flatiron District at Almond (12 E. 22nd Street btw B'way and Park Ave). When Almond opened, everyone was talking about the restaurant's cursed location (see here and here). It's in the former Borough Food & Drink, Brasserio Caviar & Banana, and Rocco's on 22nd space- from DiSpirito's \"The Restaurant\". But we've heard great things about the restaurant from our friends Josh and Nicole who were hoping that it would survive the curse and the recession (they live right across the street- talk about a great location). No doubt a tough time to open but with good prices and good food, the initial buzz was positive. So, after a few months under their belt, we finally made it there last night with Josh and Nicole. The place was very busy and the bar was packed- a good sign. We had drinks at the bar- a glass of Sauvignon Blanc (Loire valley) and a Blue Point IPA. We sat in the back of the dining room near the pool table/lounge area. Nicole and I ordered a bottle of Chenin Blanc for under $40, which was excellent while the boys stuck with the beer. Now for the food... We started with the Fruit de Mer \"tasting of all three\" for about $15. This has to be the best value appetizer I have had in a while. The plate had a generous serving of scallop and fennel crudo, a glass filled with marinated octopus, and a curried mussel cocktail. All four of us were able to have a couple of mussels each and get a nice tasting of the crudo and octopus. I was hugely impressed at that price point. We also ordered the duck confit with creamy lentils and banyuls vinegar for $12. This was also very tasty and classically prepared, but it was not the best choice to split between four people because we had to remove the meat from the bone and divide it up. The meat was tender and fell off the bone and the flavors of the lentils and banyuls vinegar came together nicely. It was a bit on the salty side. BEST PART... \"Le Grand Macaroni & Cheese\" with prosciutto and chopped truffles for $18. Can comfort food get any better than this? We all shared the truffle m&c and I couldn't imagine eating the whole dish alone (well, I could dream about it but would have to spend a few days in the gym afterwards). It was rich, decadent, creamy, crispy on top, flavorful, and fabulous... you get the idea. I do love having truffles shaved over any dish, so this is not exactly comparable to the Waverly Inn m&c, because they are chopped, but I do have to say that I enjoyed this more (and for $18 instead of $55). Andy certainly couldn't keep his wandering spoon away from the au gratin dish. For my entrée, I had the monkfish which came in a tomato broth with mussels, clams, and shrimp for $24. It was as hearty as a fish dish could get (besides some of the John Dory entrees I've tried)- perfect comfort food for a chilly night in the city. I felt like I was eating a tasty home cooked meal and I was surprised at how many mussels, clams, and shrimp were in the dish. The vegetables and fresh herbs were plentiful and the tomato broth was steaming. I couldn't even finish all of my shellfish. Andy and Josh had the plat du jour, duck à l'orange for $29. I tasted a bit of Andy's and the duck breast was perfectly medium rare. I love this dish and it did bring me back to a bistro in Paris- job well done. Nicole ordered the sea scallops for $22 and also enjoyed her dish. I did not try them, but they looked perfectly cooked- another success. By the time dessert came around, we were very happily stuffed. All in all, this is not a bargain destination but it is a very good value for the amount and for the quality of food you will have and for the friendly service and bustling atmosphere. It is also impressive to find a wine list with a number of bottles under $40. We'll be back and next time I'll be challenging Andy to a game of pool. I wish we lived across the street.

The news from TONY, Eater and Midtown Lunch is that a new burger joint is slated to open in Bloomie's in the men's lower level on Feb 23rd. The good news is that it will feature three different Pat LaFrieda beef blends—hearty (short rib), sweet (brisket) and refined (Wagyu)— as well as lamb, turkey or veggie options, among others. I love the La Frieda Black Label Burger at City Burger. The bad news is that they are naming this burger joint Flip. Sound familiar? Well, it should. Richard Blais of Season 4 Top Chef fame opened a burger joint in Atlanta back in December called Flip. This is where it gets interesting, though. Blais has been hinting since last summer that a Manhattan outpost of Flip may be in the works. As Blais, a New York native, told TimeOut NY about Flip in July: \"[New York] is the next market we’re looking to hit.\" Looks like we may have one of those legal name battles on our hands again. As recently as Feb. 12th, Blais wrote on his blog, Trail Blais, that, \"On the cooking front, of course, I’m getting ready for Flip’s expansion...with three cities expected later this year, and up to 9 the following.\" If NYC is one of those markets, we can't have 2 Flip's here. It'll be too confusing. We may have to settle this in a good old fashioned Burger Wars showdown.

Our Amazing Night @ Halfsteak's Top Chef Screening

***CONTENT
It was a total last-minute decision. Do we head downtown in the cold rain to try out Halfsteak at Craftsteak, the latest recession-friendly stroke of genius from the Colicchio empire, and perhaps get to see some Top Chef judges and contestants in the process, or do we just go home, order in some food, pop open a bottle of wine and watch Top Chef from the comfort of our living room? We decided what the heck, let's do it...and never have we made a better call. Turns out we got to mingle and chat with just about the entire cast of this season's Top Chef for close to 3 hours, as well as 'wine and dine' extensively on Halfsteak's amazing menu. Most all of the contestants were in NYC for the taping of the reunion show earlier in the day. Notably absent was Jeff. The highlights had to be hanging out at length with Stefan, who's hilarious, chilling with a slightly bummed-out Fabio, and getting to meet just about every single person involved in the production of Top Chef, including judges Colicchio, Padma and Toby Young. We arrived at Halfsteak at about 6:45pm thinking the place was going to be a madhouse given the publicity of the Top Chef screening on sites like Eater and Grub Street. Much to our surprise, Halfsteak, the name for the massive bar area in the front of the restaurant, was not a mob scene yet. The hostess told us that if we were ordering dinner that we could have one of the open tables and stay through the screening. She said we were going to be \"quite pleased\" with our table in the back left section of the bar area. Turns out we were at the table closest to the long table set up for the Top Chef crew. What ensued was perhaps the most memorable, entertaining and indulgent 5-hours we've ever spent in a restaurant. We were first struck by just how extensive the selections at Halfsteak are. Colicchio and chef Shane McBride did not mess around when brainstorming and creating this massive double-sided menu (see last night's full menu at the end). There are sections of small plates, salads, sandwiches, “small pots” and even a half order of a steak w/ fries, all for under $15, and many for under $10. The menu also includes half pints of beer for $3.50, specialty cocktails for $7.50, an array of wines by the glass for around $10 and several reasonably priced bottles of wine. We knew we needed to devise an ordering strategy. There were so many things we wanted to try and so much time we needed to kill. But first we needed a drink. We each went with the \"Half Naked,\" a libation of tequila, cointreau, jalapeno and fresh lime juice. Served in a mini mason jar, this was a perfect cocktail with a kick. For Round 1, we went with the Fried Oysters, Sliders and a Romaine Salad w/ shredded truffled pecorino cheese. All three were delicious, but the sliders were my favorite. The fried oysters were up there as one of Jill's faves. Jill then ordered a glass of white wine while for some reason I decided to make it my mission to drink all 5 of the half-pints on tap...and so I started with the Smuttynose IPA. Apparently, a team from CNN had heard all the buzz about Halfsteak and the Top Chef screening and they were on-hand to interview people for a story on dining during the recession and the toll it's taking on restaurants. They came over and interviewed Jill and I for the story, and we got in some good plugs for W&D. We'll have to wait and see if we make the cut. The interview killed some time and we decided to embark on Round 2. We went with the Chicken Fried Cod and Sausgage w/ Feta, Romaine and Grapefruit. Both of these were insanely good. Jill's favorite of the night was the Cod with the capers and great tartar sauce. I loved the spiciness of the sausage link, especially in combination with the grapefruit. By now it was 8:30pm and the Top Chef crew would be arriving in the next half hour or so. Jill decided to order a bottle of wine, a 2005 Gigondas, while I proceeded with Beer #2, a Pork Slap. For Round 3, we slowed down a bit and went with the Chicken & Lobster Pot Pie. Unfortunately, it arrived just as all the Top Chef contestants were arriving, so I was a bit distracted as Fabio and Stefan took seats at the long table less than a foot away from us. Jill loved it and said it was her second favorite dish next to the fried cod. It was pretty surreal watching everyone show up one-by-one and take seats literally right next to us. Stefan was in good spirits and started chatting with us. It was pretty obvious he wasn't going home this week. His drink was taking a while to arrive so we poured him some of our wine. We chatted a bit with Fabio, who was so nice and outgoing despite the bad news that was about to become public. I have to say he didn't seem his normal self and even seemed to get a bit frustrated with Stefan, who was bouncing around the room taking pics with fans and seemingly on top of the world. If it wasn't apparent then, we started to figure out during the show that Fabio was the one going home. Also in the house was Ken Friedman, a principal owner of The Spotted Pig, The John Dory and The Rusty Knot. Apparently, the contestants all were at The Spotted Pig for dinner the night before. Padma arrived with Ted Forstmann. Newlywed Gail Simmons was there with husband Jeremy. Despite all the fanfare and mingling, we still had some eating to do. So we ordered the signature halfsteak w/ fries and fried mac & cheese for Round 4. The steak, a generous 6 oz. NY Strip, was cooked perfectly and delicious. It may be that we were caught up in the moment, but we were not blown away by the fried mac & cheese. We'll have to give it another try soon. Unfortunately, the volume wasn't turned up enough for any of us to really hear what was going on in the show. Who needs volume, though, when you have Stefan adding commentary? Unfortunately, Stefan soon left the table due to the lack of volume and went to watch the show at the bar where it could be heard. Towards the end of the show, Padma, Tom and Toby all came to the back of the table near us to mingle with some of the other contestants. One of the highlights had to be getting to hang out back there and overhear all of the interesting conversations and witness the dynamic between everyone. Fabio was talking with Padma just as he was about to get the boot and I overheard him ask her, \"Did you really tell me to pack my knives and go home or did you just say my name?\" We also had a nice conversation with contestant Ariane, who was there with her husband and daughters. In fact, we're going to head out to Montclair, NJ one of these days to check out her restaurant, CulinAriane.

I must say that the commentary was very delightful...had an opportunity to try Craft Steak on \"black Saturday\" and have to admit that it was one of the most enjoyable, fulfilling, orgasmic, savory dinner I've ever had! And I wanted to go to Half Steak that evening sooo bad...glad you enjoyed it and wrote about it...

Making Our Own RW Menu & Recession Special at Mia Dona
***AUTHOR
Jill
***DATE
2009-02-19 12:31:00
***CONTENT
We reported earlier that Mia Dona is one of the restaurants that has extended Restaurant Week through February 27th, so we headed over to our favorite Italian neighborhood spot for dinner this past Monday night. Mia Dona, brought to us by restaurateur Donatella Arpaia and chef Michael Psilakis, is our go-to spot for amazing Italian in our neighborhood of midtown east (located at 206 East 58th btw 2nd and 3rd). It has always tended to be more of a splurge night out rather than a budget dinner choice for us, but we figured out that it doesn't have to be (even when the Feb. 27th Restaurant Week extension is over). We remember reading this Bruni NYT article back in December (that our ATL friend Elyssa forwarded to us) about how Bruni spent less than $100 on 3-course dinners for two at 5 great restaurants over a 5-night period (inlcuding tax and tip, but excluding alcohol). What we took away from this article (besides a strong desire to try The Redhead in E. Village) is the idea that high-end restaurants can either be as expensive or as reasonable as a diner makes them. We've found that by carefully steering our way through a menu, especially the small plates and appetizers section, we can come away from a great restaurant plenty full after having tried many of the best offerings... and with some money still in our pocket. Mia Dona is a case-in-point. Andy and I were dining with family, Donna, Stacey, and little Zoe, so we wanted to try a lot of different dishes and not stick to the Restaurant Week selections (although the RW menu did look great- 4 choices of appetizers including the meatballs and the orecchiette, 4 choices of entrees including the butternut squash tortelli and grilled branzino, and 4 choices of desserts including the tiramisu and maple panna cotta gelato). We did take advantage of the RW wine, a nice bottle of Italian red for $35- Rosso di Toscana, caparzo, montalcino, Italy ($8 by the glass). In the end, we realized that if you put your mind to it, you can walk away from Mia Dona without paying a fortune for an excellent dinner. I chose an appetizer for my main course- the grilled octopus with fingerling potatoes, olives, feta, and anchovy vinaigrette for $14. I had ordered this dish before and was really craving it (well that and the gnudi but I was trying not to overindulge after a ridiculous weekend of eating). As somewhat of a 2nd course, I ordered my favorite side- roasted brussels sprouts, pecorino, and pancetta for $10. The brussels sprouts are so good... a very generous portion of sprouts and a ton of pancetta. The savory, smoky goodness would be quite hard to find in any other vegetable dish. So, my food total (minus the bites I took from everyone else's plates) amounted to $24 pre-tax/tip. Not so bad for a satisfying Mia Dona dinner. Andy chose a bit of a pasta tasting dinner. He first started off with the mia meatballs with tomato, onion, and parmesan for $9- hearty, classic, and gone as soon as they arrived. Instead of choosing one large pasta, he went with two small portions. Mia Dona has two sizes (and two prices) for all their pasta dishes, so this is a nice option if you don't want a massive plate of pasta, want some variety and also want to save some cash. He ordered a small plate of the gnudi with mushrooms, crispy prosciutto, and truffle butter (our absolute favorite menu item) for $12. He also ordered a small plate of the pappardelle bolognese with veal, speck, and parmesan for $11. His \"pasta tasting\" with an appetizer came to $32 pre-tax/tip. We both saved some money over the Restaurant Week dinner price while still enjoying our favorite dishes. We also took advantage of the $35 RW wine option (they have a white choice as well). Being that we're not that into dessert, this was surely the way to go. We also have to comment on the great service- thanks to the Mia Dona crew for squeezing us in with a stroller for niece Zoe! And for a last comment on Mia Dona... pitchers of PBR for $9... oh yeah, and they have a daily happy hour special b/t 5:00-7:00pm where you can get 2-for-1 beers and mixed drinks...need we say more?

Sandro's Dow Jones Pasta Index Special

Andy
***DATE
2009-02-18 16:26:00
***CONTENT
We have been hearing about more and more stock market-based Recession Specials. The latest one comes from Sandro's, a traditional Roman Italian restaurant on the UES (81st nr 2nd Ave). Starting today, Monday through Friday from 4:30pm to 6:30pm, Sandro’s pastas are priced at the first three digits of the day’s closing of the Dow Jones Index until the Dow breaks 11,000, i.e. circa 2012. While I'm no Alan Greenspan, I can guarantee you this special ain't going away anytime soon. So, if the Dow closes today between 7,500-7,600 the price of any pasta will be between $7.50-$7.60, or about a third of the regular prices of $19-21. Some other stock market based specials, including one involving bottles of wine, follow... The \"Market Tanked? Get Tanked!\" Special at Trinity Place located in the Financial District (Broadway at Cedar): All drinks are $3 from 3:30 p.m. to 5 p.m. whenever the market finishes in the red. Bailout Wine by Crushpad: We heard about this special stock market driven wine deal from the good folks at TastingTable. Here's how it works: the 2007 Bailout Napa Valley Cabernet is a blend of grapes from some of Napa vineyards. Bailout's prepurchase (aka futures) price is $39 (not a bad starting price considering the high price of most Napa cabs). And the price can only get better from here; (1) You preorder the wine for $39 per bottle and Crushpad records the closing value of the Dow Industrial Average on your purchase date, (2) For every 100 points the Dow drops from the purchase date, Crushpad takes $2 off the final price of each bottle (which can go as low as $9 per bottle), and (3) The final price will be settled on August 14, 2009, and you'll be reimbursed for the difference (consider it a \"stimulus check\"). Your wine will then be bottled and shipped. Unfortunately, the market has pretty much bottomed out and will likely not fall further enough to truly make this an incredible deal. The time to have signed up for this deal would have been this past Fall, not now.

Recession-Re-smession. We just read on Crain's that a deal is in the works between Drew Nieporent's Myriad Restaurant Group (Nobu, Tribeca Grill, Corton, Mai House, etc.) and food-sevice provider Aramark for Myriad to take over Left Field Restaurant, a full-service restaurant at Citi Field. If things work out, Myriad would be the next big-name NYC restaurant group to join Danny Meyer's Union Square Hospitality Group in setting up shop at Citi Field. Shake Shack and Blue Smoke have already signed on to open up locations at Citi Field come the start of the baseball season in April. In addition, Meyer's USHG has plans for two new food concepts at Citi Field – a taquería and a Belgian frites stand called \"Pop Fries.\" USHG will also be providing all food and beverage services at Citi Field’s Sterling Club, the premium seating area for 1,600 guests on the Field Level directly behind home plate, including a wine bar. Check out the virtual tour of Citi Field here. So much for Peanuts and Crackerjacks.

\"Recession Reviews\" by 89th and Broke: Halfsteak at Craftsteak

***CONTENT
With all the Recession Specials, Happy Hour Specials and Dining Deals out there these days, and with many restaurants extending their Restaurant Week offerings indefinitely, it would be nearly impossible for Jill and I to cover them all and report back to you. That's why we we're excited to announce the launch of a special section on W&D called \"Recession Reviews\" in partnership with the blog 89th and Broke. 89th and Broke is run by Laura and Caryn, a budget-conscious duo of young professionals residing on the UES and Gramercy whose M.O. is to seek out the best places to grab a drink and dinner at an affordable price around the city and then write about their experiences. Some of their recent reviews caught our eye. Their first \"Recession Review\" couldn't be more timely. We learned yesterday on Grub Street that Tom Colicchio and the current season Top Chef cheftestants are having dinner at Halfsteak tonight and staying to watch the Top Chef episode. The pair headed out last Wednesday for a test-run. Here's their take on the Halfsteak. Posted by Laura and Caryn (Laura’s thoughts in italics): After hitting up Craft’s Thrifty Thursday (the one-time Thursday installment of Frugal Friday), I was thrilled to see that Craftsteak was going to offer something similar. According to a post on Eater, Craftsteak now has “Halfsteak” on Wednesday, where they have half a steak, small plates, half pints of beer, half cocktails and sandwiches all under $15. Laura and I immediately made plans to go to dinner together Wednesday night, and we perused the menu in advance so we knew what our top choices were upon entering. We walked in with the grand hopes of trying maybe four dishes or so, but we didn’t make it past two. We knew we wanted to try the Wagyu Nachos and Meatball, Gnocchi and Smoked Mozzarella Casserole, and after our waiter mentioned those as two of the best on the menu, we knew we were set. We thought we’d order as we go so we didn’t get too full, and it’s a good thing we did that. We really wanted to try the Fried Mac and Cheese (another recommendation from our waiter) and the Coullette Steak with Bacon, Mashed Potatoes and Spinach, but we couldn’t bear the thought of trying to work our way through either dish. We finally gave up and just went straight to dessert - Cinnamon Ice Cream Sandwiches with Oatmeal Raisin Cookies. Wagyu nachos: Sooo good. Maybe it seems like a cop-out to get the nachos and gnocchi dish, but they’re old favorites. The Wagyu beef chili was so tasty, and the avocado crème fraiche and Béchamel sauce were perfect complements. I completely agree with Caryn, the nachos were delicious, even though I’m embarrassed I got them at Craftsteak when there were many other options on the menu. Regardless, I’m a sucker for nachos and these were fantastic - the pefect amount of toppings and no soggy chips. Meatball, gnocchi and smoked mozzarella casserole: There was something a bit off about the sauce - Laura thought there was too much tomato paste. I liked it more than Laura and thought the meatballs were pretty good, and I was surprised with how many came in the dish (maybe 9?). The cheese was standard and good, as were the gnocchi. Not the best gnocchi dish I’ve ever had, but then again I was dining in a steakhouse. What’d I expect? The sauce definitely was too thick and the meatballs were just okay, the bright spot of the dish being the smokey flavor of the mozzarella cheese. It wasn’t bad but as someone who has high standards for Italian food, I could do without this dish next time. The best part of the meal was the ice cream sandwich made with cinnamon ice cream and oatmeal raisin cookies. The cookies were soft, but sturdy enough to keep the sandwich together, and flavored with orange zest and plump, golden raisins. The ice cream really surprised me. Typically I can’t taste the cinnamon in cinnamon ice cream, but the spice really stood out this time and it was delicious. Unfortunately the ice cream sandwich served for dessert can change, so there’s no guarantee you’ll get to enjoy this one. The surprise of the evening? Definitely the free scone with white chocolate and raspberries that every diner received in a nice little plastic bag on their way out. We saved ours for snacks the next day and they were outstanding. I love a to-go treat from a restaurant, especially when it’s unexpected. I was really surprised to leave with a scone, and even more surprised how great it tasted the next afternoon. We also loved our waiter. Unlike a recent report of poor service at L’Absinthe after diners opted to order off the Restaurant Week menu, our waiter couldn’t have been more attentive or friendlier, even answering all of our ridiculous questions about Tom Colicchio (and yes, they played Top Chef in the bar on Wednesday night!), working at Craft and CraftSteak, his favorite restaurants in the city, etc. Our waiter also mentioned that during the Halfsteak special, waiters are encouraged to be a little more informal and more conversational with patrons. Caryn and I may haven taken that a little too far - Elliott, when are you planning on writing your guest post? All in all I was very pleased with my dining experience, but then again, it could have just been my good company. I was pleased with my dining experience as well, even though I wasn’t a big fan of the gnocchi dish. Several people I’ve told about CraftSteak asked if the meal was out of our price range. For $26 (including tip), I left feeling completely stuffed - and drank a half pint of a “classier” beer, as well as enjoyed dessert - so a much better deal than some of the mediocre meals I had during Restaurant Week. According to our waiter, Halfsteak will be offered indefinitely, so if interested in trying the meal, we encourage you to call before you go. If you do decide to go, from our experience it makes the most sense to go with a bigger group. If we had a group of three to four, we would have definitely had the opportunity to try several more dishes without feeling too full. The Basics Name: Craftsteak Location: 85 10th Avenue (Near 15th - we know, it’s a hike) Who to take: Friends, Date Price: One less drink at the bar next week. $$$. Overall: Put it in the rotation on Wednesdays - or try to go at least once. 4 stars.

called up yesterday and they aren't taking reservations for tonight in the bar area. they told me i'd have to get there early to get a seat or table. would love to sit at a table near tom with friends and pretend to be judges critiquing the food as it comes out. had the fried mac n' cheese last week and it was awesome.

Impressive that the 2 \"half\"-dishes and dessert was enough for 2 people. I thought the portions would be micro-sized. Gonna have to check it out for sure.

2009-02-18 12:53:00
Lesider - We were surprised too how large the portion were - but keep in mind we did get heavy dishes. I'm sure if we went for a lighter dish, we may have been able to squeeze in three plates and dessert.

DiningFever Discount Dinner @ Amber: A Success!

We reported our plans to use the 20% off diningfever.com discount for our pre-movie dinner at the Murray Hill location of Amber, and it turned out to be a great choice. Not only did the coupon work, but more importantly we had an amazing Asian fusion dinner and great drinks at a very reasonable price. Before we went, Andy said he was a bit skeptical of all the positive reviewson MenuPages. Turns out they were probably not shills. We will certainly be back to Amber for our next pre-theatre dinner in \"the Hill.\" Amber is located on 3rd Ave. between 27th and 28th. It is only a short walk from the AMC Loews Kips Bay theatre on 2nd Ave. and 31st. We got there early (there were only 2 other customers in the place), so we grabbed a booth by the bar rather than heading upstairs to the dining room. First of all, the restaurant is modern and nicely decorated- tremendously tall ceilings, exposed brick, comfortable leather chairs, impressive floral arrangements, and flat screens at the main (roomy) bar. Everyone was very friendly and happy to have us there. I started off with a very strong saketini (sake and plum wine with some refreshing cucumbers) while Andy had a frozen green tree margarita (with a $2 substitute for Patron). We had plenty of time before the movie, so we went all out on appetizers and decided to wait to order our main entrees. We had the tuna lover tasting (delicious tasting of four tuna pieces with pairings of delicate sauces- I loved this subtle and fresh dish and definitely could have ordered this as my sushi entree), the Vietnamese shrimp summer roll served with chili hoisin sauce (crisp, classic, and tasty), and the Thai spiced chicken wrap (a nice balance with the basil and pineapple, although I would have preferred it to be even more spicy). I switched over to a nice glass of sauvignon blanc and Andy to a Kirin beer. For our main meal, I had the Amber special sashimi, which was absolutely amazing. It was also massive- Andy and I could have easily shared this after all our appetizers or I could have skipped the apps for the sashimi dish. There were generous portions of two types of salmon, two types of tuna and yellowtail, a huge serving of live orange clams, uni (sea urchin roe in a carved out cucumber tulip), red snapper, and fluke. It was presented beautifully- flowers, clam shell, etc. and all the fish was as fresh as I could have hoped for. It definitely exceeded all my expectations for a neighborhood sushi joint. Andy had the Thai crispy chicken breast served with sweet/chili sauce. There was a very generous portion of crispy chicken strips in a very tasty, very spicy sauce. It was a perfect pick for him, except after all the apps it was impossible to finish. The spice level was perfect too. All in all, we couldn't have hoped for a better pre-movie dinner. As we finished up, the bar became a bit more crowded and a few more tables sat for dinner. I definitely hope this place survives, because it will be my go to sushi spot in the neighborhood. Know Before You Go: If you're using the 20% off coupon, they will add a 20% surcharge to the bill automatically as the tip. We had to ask what it was to make sure we didn't double-tip.

while amber may have good food, those are definitely shills on the menupages site. especially the one from 'oldtimer.' classic shill move. it not only talks up the delivery service and quality but makes the place sound appealing to young, hip 20-somethings. i give it a 95% shill probability. the comment from Special G is definitely a shill, too. i have no doubt.

Valentine's Day '09: A Romantic Evening at Blue Hill at Stone Barns

Andy and I always are trying to find any excuse to get out and indulge in a tasting menu at one of our favorite restaurants. When we saw Valentine's Day falling on a Saturday, not only did we think it was the perfect excuse for a splurge night out, it also became the perfect weekend for a little trip out of Manhattan to hit up one of our all time favorite restaurants, Blue Hill at Stone Barns. Blue Hill at Stone Barns is truly a magical place. Only a short trip from Manhattan (about 35 minutes by express train from Grand Central), it is located at 630 Bedford Road in Pocantico Hills. You find yourself in the middle of a functional, four season farm, where most of the ingredients you taste originated. Talk about a seasonal, market driven menu! Blue Hill at Stone Barns is on the old Rockefeller estate. The restaurant is in a gorgeously renovated dairy barn and sits in the center of the Stone Barns Center for Food and Agriculture, \"80 rolling acres of gardens, pastures and woods.\" On the Stone Barns Center website, it describes its mission- \"to celebrate, teach and advance community-based food production and enjoyment, from farm to classroom to table.\" Our mission- to devour Dan Barber's truly exceptional creations and to celebrate our passion for food and each other in a place where you truly feel like you're a million miles away from the city. The Blue Hill at Stone Barn's menu is more like a list of seasonal ingredients. The \"multi-course farm feasts\" are \"inspired by the day's harvest.\" We read what was in season... Maine sea scallops, Stone Barn Berkshire pigs, Red Russian kale, Brown African goose, Hudson Valley venison, Jerusalem artichokes... it goes on and on. We have been to the restaurant on a number of occasions but we try to go in different seasons for totally different menus and experiences. You have the option of a 5-course tasting for $95 or a Farmer's Feast for $125. We knew we were in for a treat with the 5-course V-Day tasting menu. We also opted for the wine pairings, and the wines were ideally matched with each course. It would be impossible to properly describe each dish, each flavor, and each small touch that made the evening so memorable, so instead we will highlight our most memorable dishes below. Although we are all in a recession conscious mindset, if you are splurging on a special occasion, we urge you to splurge here and make a weekend or at least an overnight trip out if. We promise you won't be disappointed. Our Favorites: Amuse Bouche: They kicked off the meal with an unreal amuse bouche trio. First there was the fresh oyster with cranberries. Next, was the fried potato chip. They saved the best amuse bouche for last. The server came by with 2 tall shot glasses of hot artichoke soup and what looked like a medicine dropper. He asked that we each make a fist. He put a drop of some sort of blood red sauce on our fist and instructed us to lick the red sauce and then quickly follow it up with the artichoke shooter. It was amazing. Hudson Valley Foie Gras Course: First, we both opted for the Hudson Valley foie gras that was served with a sweet, nutty fig bread. We actually preferred it with the bread that was on the table. We washed it down with a '97 Riesling. Decadent. Poached Lobster Course: For the second course, we both went with the poached lobster served over a perfectly executed assortment of savory winter vegetables from the Blue Hill farm. They paired it with a great Chardonnay. We both agreed that this was the best course. Suckling Pig (Andy) / Loin of Lamb (me): Next, Andy had suckling pig and I went with the loin of lamb. Both were perfectly cooked and delicious. We don't even remember the dessert (we're not huge dessert people) but they were terrific and they even brought us the one dessert we didn't order \"courtesy of the chef.\" They also gave us a mini-goodie bag to take home with us. Where to Stay Near Blue Hill at Stone Barns: We stayed at the Tarrytown House Estate. They had a great V-Day package that included a bottle of champagne in the room and a box of chocolate truffles. We thought it was going to be a bottle of Cava or an inexpensive Prosecco. We were surprised, however, when a bottle of 2005 Wolffer Estate Blanc de Blancs was delivered to our room. This wine sells for $35 on the Wolffer Estate website. We also got a complimentary breakfast buffet the next morning in the beautiful castle overlooking the grounds and the Hudson River. While this hotel is massive (more of a business conference center than a small, charming hotel), we enjoyed the amenities that included an indoor heated pool, jacuzzi and sauna. Before our dinner reservation at Blue Hill, we headed over to Cellar 49 in the lower level of the castle. They were nice enough to let us bring our own bottle of wine, a 1982 Chateau Lascombes, for a small corkage fee and they even provided a decanter. The wine was amazing. We took our wine with us and headed to the nearby game room for some games of pool and shuffleboard. Another place that we would recommend staying is Castle on the Hudson. This historic hotel is perched high atop a bluff overlooking the river valley and is quite an impressive structure that replicates the architecture of medieval Europe with a massive stone facade and towers and turrets. While the whole point is to have dinner at Blue Hill at Stone Barns, the Castle has an award-winning restaurant of its own, Equus, which is supposed to be excellent. We had an amazing (and pricey) brunch there and really love the Castle on the Hudson. If you're going for an all out romantic splurge weekend away, this is your place. How to Get Here: Train: We take the train from Grand Central to Tarrytown and then take a taxi from the train station (they are there waiting). If you're staying overnight, your hotel will call a taxi for you to get there and the restaurant will call a taxi for you to get back to your hotel (check in with them before dessert). Driving: Check out the Blue Hill at Stone Barns website for directions.

Amuse Bouche, literally translated to \"mouth amuser\" [for bouche = mouth; amuser = to amuse, to please]. Nice.

Zpizza Chain of California Coming to W. Village

We just read that Zpizza, a California-based casual counter-service eatery whose aim is to offer \"lighter, healthier, delicious and creative pizza,\" is slated to open a location in the W. Village. Zpizza has been called the Baja Fresh or Panera Bread of pizza. It's known for its 100% certified organic tomato sauce, 100% certified organic wheat flour, Wisconsin low-fat mozzarella and its choices of unique natural toppings, including MSG-free pepperoni and additive-free chicken cilantro sausage. Throw in some Cremini and Shitaki mushrooms, roasted eggplant, pili pili and truffle oil, pine nuts, Greek olives, roasted bell peppers or caramelized onions and you can think up some pretty compelling combinations here. Zpizza was started in Laguna Beach back in '86 and has grown to have close to 100 franchise locations across the country. There are more than 50 in CA alone. In addition to pizza, they offer an array of sandwiches, salads and calzones. Interesting they would select W. Village over Midtown as the first NYC location. Maybe it's because of all of the Hollywood celebs who know of Zpizza from their time on the left coast. Will be interesting to see how a CA pizza place fares in NYC where we're pretty particular about and partial to our own NY-style pizza. Wake me up when there's an In-N-Out or Chick-fil-A.

Daytona 500 Viewing Party @ Foley's NY Pub & Restaurant

\"Hi, my name is Jill... and I am a NASCAR fan.\" There. I did it. In NYC, it is not easy to be a NASCAR fan and it is never easy to find a bar that will put on the race. During football season, even when the Chase races are on, I've been laughed at, dismissed, and figuratively spit on when I've asked to turn one of a bar's 20 something flat screens to the race. I have found my solution, well at least for this Sunday- Foley's NY Pub & Restaurant's Daytona 500 Viewing Party. The Daytona 500 kicks off the 2009 NASCAR season (for all you Days of Thunder fans- it is the first and not the last race of the season). Foley's is inviting all NASCAR fans in NYC (are there any of you out there?) to come over and watch the race with some great specials. The party runs from 3 pm- 7 pm (coverage starts on Fox at 2 pm). Jimmie Johnson (who won his 3rd championship in a row last year) bought a round of Harp for the room at the Sprint Cup media luncheon that was held at Foley's in December, so if he wins, it's free Harp on the house. Other specials are listed below. The ESPN Zone is also having a viewing party, but to be a real NASCAR fan you need to be watching in a real bar. I'll be there with my Gordon gear on, so if you're a fan... please join me! GO 24! Foley's 500 Specials: - All pints of draft beer $5 (500 pennies... get it) - Chicken wings (buffalo, bbq, or spicy garlic) $5 - Chicken fingers $5 - If Jimmie Johnson takes home the trophy, a round of Harp on the house. - If Kasey Kahne wins, a free bud aluminum bottle on the house (he drives the Bud Dodge, #9). - If Kurt Busch wins, a free pint of Miller Lite on the house (he drives the Miller Lite Dodge #2). - If Jeff Gordon wins, Jill pounds some celebratory shots (not a special, just a hope). - No word on any specials for Jamie McMurray's performance in the Crown Royal 26 car, but I'm sure Andy will be sipping on some Crown regardless. Also offered: a Jeff Gordon's grilled chicken sandwich w/ lettuce, onions, and roasted peppers for $12, a Jimmie Johnson's NASCAR platter of wings, fingers, skins, and sticks for $14, a Regan Smith's roast beef sandwich with gravy for $11, a Dale Earnhardt Jr. burger w/ bacon, mushrooms, onions, and cheese for $13, and a Carl Edward's big beef burger with an extra ½ pound beef patty for $19. I'll obviously be trying out the grilled chicken sandwich, but the wings special also sounds awfully good. Gentlemen... start your engines.

The best NASCAR bar used to be Buster's Garage in Tribeca but that closed a couple of years ago. Foleys was lots of fun, but unfortunately not too many NASCAR fans showed up at all. If you know of any other NASCAR bars, please do let us know.

We have written about DiningFever.com's great restaurant deals before, but we have never actually taken advantage of any of them ourselves. Tonight we're going to finally give it a try at Amber, an Asian fusion/sushi outpost at 381 3rd Ave. btw 27th and 28th. We've heard great things about Amber's Murray Hill location and we're headed to the Kips Bay movie theater (to get in all those Oscar picks before next Sun.), so we decided to do our pre-theater dinner at Amber. We went onto DiningFever and searched for \"Amber.\" The Murray Hill (or Gramercy Park as they call it) location is offering 20% off for lunch and dinner. We followed the three step instructions to take advantage of the deal (call the restaurant, mention the code, and print the page). The restaurant told us that all we need to do is print out the coupon and show it to our server for 20% off (not available on Saturdays). We'll let you know how it works out and what we thought of Amber (applauded by some as the best neighborhood sushi place in \"the Hill\").

The James Beard Foundation: 2009 Semifinalists Announced & Dinner Events to Check Out
***AUTHOR
Jill
***DATE
2009-02-13 12:15:00
***CONTENT
The James Beard Foundation 2009 Semifinalists were announced and some of our favorites made the list (nominees will be announced on 3/23). Dan Barber is one of the semifinalists for Outstanding Chef, and we're headed to his restaurant, one of our favorites, Blue Hill at Stone Barns tomorrow. We've had some of amazing '08 meals at Babbo, an Outstanding Restaurant semifinalist (I am still dreaming of the truffle tasting menu). We would like to say we've made it in Momofuko Ko, a Best New Restaurant semifinalist, but we haven't been lucky enough quite yet. In perusing the JFB website, I came across a number of amazing dinners coming up at the Beard House (167 West 12th Street). Although they are a little on the pricey side (normally around $165 for non-members and $125 for members), when you check out these menus and the wine pairings, there is no doubt that you'll get your money's worth. We also discovered that we can become Associate Members for $125 a year and receive the discounted member price for all JBF events. We will certainly do that, because there are some amazing dinners on the horizon. We will keep updating our events calendar with some of the more exciting dinners that we find, but here is a sampling of dinners we would love to get to in the coming months... 2/19 Modern French Degustation: Jason Weiner of Almond (NYC and Bridgehampton) will serve \"bold, unpretentious French food\" paired with French wines. Some menu highlights: truffled twice-baked fingerling potatoes, chestnut soup with foie gras crouton, 50-year-aged sherry vinegar and brown butter crème fraiche, and seared diver scallops with guinea hen ravioli, salsify, and house-cured pork jowl. 2/28 Modern Mediterranean: Rodney Murillo of Cambridge's Davio's and Avila, \"uses local ingredients to create a varied, modern menu that highlights the best of Italy, Spain, France, Portugal, and Greece.\" Some menu highlights: sangrita shooters with lobster, creamy corn-coriander soup with foie gras brulee and sauternes gelee, Serrano ham-wrapped halibut with Portuguese-style braised beans, chorizo foam, and salsa verde, and roasted rack of lamb with chamomile risotto cake, morels, olive teardrop, and brussels sprouts leaves. 3/6 Celebrating Colorado's Bounty: 3 chefs and the founder of Steamworks Brewing Co. will prepare this dinner \"where you'll sample award-winning Colorado beers and unique wines, paired with a farm-to-table inspired menu.\" Some menu highlights: Foxfire Farms sweetbreads with chestnut puree and caramelized western slope apples, Colorado grass-fed steak tartar with grilled anchovies and violet mustard on pretzel rolls, River Ranches twenty-four-hour oxtail confit ravioli with red Fresno chile, abbondanza black kale, and parmesan broth, and Colorado striped bass steak with Cure Organic Farm fingerling potatoes, artichokes, smoked paprika, and bread salsa. 3/21 A Night at Rao's: If you can't get into Rao's, at least you can have the next best thing when the NYC Rao's team comes to you (or to the Beard House). Some menu highlights: Risotto with endive, radicchio, and sautéed shrimp, garganelli with brussels sprouts and pancetta, Rao's meatballs, stuffed veal loin with porcini ragout and fried polenta, and pan-seared red snapper with cherry tomatoes, Gaeta olives, caper berries, and oregano. Note that this dinner is more pricey than the others ($650 for non-members, $400 of which is a tax-deductible charitable donation). 3/31 Pig and Pinot Feast: Ryan Skeen (one of the semifinalists for Rising Star Chef of the Year) will prepare \"a pig-centric menu of signature dishes to be paired with a bold selection of Pinot Noirs from around the world.\" Some menu highlights: Eggs and bacon, fried pork belly tea sandwiches, crispy pig's ear salad with tarbais beans, chicory, tomato confit, truffle vinaigrette, and poached quail egg, Irving Mill chacuterie plate, and oatmeal and chocolate chip cookie sandwich with Matt Greco's bacon ice cream. 4/14 Frederick Farmlands Feast: Bryan Voltaggio of Volt \"turns seasonal and local into lusty and soulful\" at this farmland feast. Some menu highlights: Longenecker farm rabbit with Sugarloaf Mountain morels, fava beans, and golden sage, Mary's Delight Farm lamb loin, chop, and shoulder with puffed barley and mint pudding, and wild striped bass with green garlic, stewed mustard, long pepper, and fiddlehead ferns. 4/20 Modern Sushi and Sake Dinner: Tim and Nancy Cushman (of O Ya, on Frank Bruni's list of \"Ten Restaurants that Count\") present this sushi and sake feast. Some menu highlights: Kabayaki eel with Thai basil and Kyoto sansho, assortments of Nigri sushi and of sashimi, seared petite wagyu strip loin with tiny smoked potato, grilled onion, and fresh wasabi, and Kabayaki foie gras with balsamic-chocolate sauce and raisin-cocoa pulp. 4/30 California Food and Wine Dinner: Andrew Kirchner and Christopher Keller will present \"boldly flavored California cuisine accompanied by wine pairings from boutique winemaker Paige 23 Wines.\" Some menu highlights: Black cod and shitake ceviche, chile and garlic softshell crab with green papaya salad, and Moroccan-spiced spring lamb with piquillo pepper harissa and fregola sarda.

(This Post was submitted by user DOHReader) I have a fascination with checking out recent restaurant inspection reports on the NYC Dept of Health website. Thought you may be interested in some notable ones I've seen lately. Here's a little background on the scoring system first. A base point value is assigned to each violation. A Public Health Hazard is the most severe type of violation and typically has a base point value of 7; other Critical Violations have a base point value of 5; and General Violations have a base point value of 2. A total of 28 or more points in either public health hazards, critical or general violations requires a follow-up inspection by the DOHMH to determine if the violations have been corrected. Dallas Jones BBQ (not Dallas BBQ) on W. Houston inspected on 1/14/09: 95 Points - Sanitary violations include milk or milk product undated, improperly dated or expired, facility not vermin proof, food item spoiled, adulterated, contaminated or cross-contaminated, and evidence of mice or live mice present in facility's food and/or non-food areas. Payard Patisserie on 1/20/09: 53 Points - Sanitary violations include milk or milk product undated, improperly dated or expired, facility not vermin proof, and evidence of mice or live mice present in facility's food and/or non-food areas. Pig & Whistle on 3rd Ave inspected on 12/22/08: 50 Points - Sanitary violations include pesticide use not in accordance with label or applicable laws, prohibited chemical used/stored, open bait station used, facility not vermin proof, and evidence of mice or live mice present in facility's food and/or non-food areas. Rothmann's Steakhouse inspected on 9/11/08: 59 Points - Sanitary violations include facility not vermin proof, food not protected from potential source of contamination during storage, preparation, transportation, display or service and evidence of flying insects or live flying insects present in facility's food and/or non-food areas. Barrow's Pub on Hudson inspected on 1/15/09: 79 Points - Sanitary violations include harmful, noxious gas or vapor detected. CO > 13 ppm, pesticide use not in accordance with label or applicable laws, prohibited chemical used/stored, open bait station used, facility not vermin proof, and evidence of mice or live mice present in facility's food and/or non-food areas. Rock Center Cafe on 12/16/08: 50 Points - One of the more interesting violations I've seen is the \"Food worker does not use proper utensil to eliminate bare hand contact with food that will not receive adequate additional heat treatment.\" Calle Ocho on 11/14/08: 58 Points - Sanitary violations include facility not vermin proof and evidence of flying insects or live flying insects present in facility's food and/or non-food areas. Republic Restaurant on 1/23/09: 58 Points - Sanitary violations include evidence of roaches or live roaches present in facility's food and/or non-food areas and evidence of rats or live rats present in facility's food and/or non-food areas. Sarabeth's on Madison on 1/13/09: 59 Points - Sanitary violations include facility not vermin proof, evidence of flying insects or live flying insects present in facility's food and/or non-food areas, evidence of roaches or live roaches present in facility's food and/or non-food areas, and evidence of mice or live mice present in facility's food and/or non-food areas.

Our New Favorite (and Budget-Friendly) Way to Buy Beer: Fresh Out of the Tap and into Our Growler
***AUTHOR

2009-02-11 17:11:00
***CONTENT
Now, we know Growlers aren't anything new to all you serious beer fans out there, but with saving some cash in mind, we've started to take advantage of the growing list of NYC spots where we can stock up on some great beer by filling up a Growler. Growlers are half gallon (64 oz.) refillable glass jugs that can be used to buy beer fresh out of the tap. You can normally purchase a Growler at any shop that sells beer in them, but the trick is to hold on to your Growler to save when you go back for a refill. Also, Growlers are ideal for bringing home some of your favorite beers that don't otherwise come in bottles/cans (think our local favorite Sixpoint). You're also getting fresh beer at home and going a little green in the process (reuse, recycle...). With Valentine's Day quickly approaching, it's also a great way to entice a beer loving partner to spend a romantic beer filled night in (who can resist when you promise to bring home a fresh and favorite craft beer?). We are working on expanding this list, so please let us know if you have some more places that will give us a fill of some quality suds. Where we go to fill up our Growler: - Whole Foods Bowery Beer Room: Check out the Whole Foods Bowery Beer Room at 95 East Houston and Bowery. Head to their website for their current line up of draught beers and for their Growler prices. - Blind Tiger Ale House: One of our favorite bars sells growlers. Head to the W. Village for your fill and do stay for a bowl of chili by the fire (so good)- 281 Bleeker St. @ Jones. - The Ginger Man: Head over to 11 East 36th btw Madison and 5th Ave. to fill up on your way home for work. Definitely a great selection. - Rattle 'N Hum: While you're in the Ginger Man area, make a stop at Rattle 'n Hum- 14 East 33rd btw Madison and 5th Ave. Two great beer bars only 3 blocks away... how convenient. - New Beer Distributors: You can also find some hard to track down brews at this LES beer center- 167 Chrystie St. btw Rivington & Delancey. - Grab Specialty Foods: If you're in Brooklyn, specifically Park Slope, fill up at Grab Specialty Foods- 7th Ave btw. 14th & 15th. - Pacific Standard: If you're in Park Slope already, might as well head to Pacific Standard at 82 Fourth Avenue btw. St. Marks and Bergen. - Bierkraft: Just in time for Valentine's Day... if you're heading to pick up Bierkraft's 12 piece box of Nunu American Craft Beer Infused Chocolates for your special someone, might as well fill up your growler while you're at it. More my style is their 6 pack of chocolate stouts for $35 (that's my kind of chocolate). 191 5th Ave. in Park Slope, Brooklyn. - Captain Lawrence Brewing Co: If you're up in Westchester, stop at the source, the Captain Lawrence Brewery at 99 Castleton St. in Pleasantville, New York (Fridays 4-7 pm, Saturdays 12-6 pm). - Blue Point Brewing Co: If you're out on the island (Long Island), head to Blue Point Brewery where you can pick up some \"fresh jugs to go.\" 161 River Ave., Patchogue, NY. (Thanks to our friend Riki for the heads up) - Dive Bars and Amsterdam 106: The \"Growler program\" is available at all of their locations for all you UWS'ers: Amsterdam @ 96th, Broadway at 101st, Columbus @ 75th, and Amsterdam @ 106th. - Chelsea Brewing Co: I just gave the folks at Chelsea Brewing Co. a call and they said that they are now selling/filling growlers. After working on your golf skills at the driving range, stop by Chelsea Brewing Co. next door for a fill- at Chelsea Piers, Pier 59, 18th and West Side Highway. - East Village Tavern: If you live in the East Village, head to the East Village Tavern for your fill- 158 Ave. C @ 10th St. Be sure to make it during happy hour on weekdays from 4-7pm and grab any draft beer for $3 (what a deal!). Our friends at beermenus.com have a very handy list of \"Places to get a Growler\" We'll try to reach out to some bars to see if we can start expanding this list. Cheers!

Lelabar in W. Village

You can add Lelabar to the list of reasons we want to move to the West Village. Andy and I visited this homey, charming wine bar located at Hudson and Leroy this past Sunday...and we didn't want to leave. We were at Lelabar for one of their Sunday afternoon guided sommelier tastings. It was an Austrian wine tasting and Andrew, the general manager and wine director, was our host. We tasted two reds (a Blauer Zweigelt and a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon/Zweigelt/Syrah/Merlot/St. Laurent). I don't think I had ever tasted an Austrian red and it really opened my eyes up to some new regions and varietals that I would like to explore more. For the main attraction, we tried four amazing Austrian whites (a Sylvaner, Gruner Veltliner, Sauvignon Blanc, and Riesling), each unique and perfectly paired with the rich cheeses, Hungarian salami, and dried beef loin. Andy's favorite from the charcuterie and cheese plates had to be the Pecorina Tartuffo cheese- the sheep's milk bursting with aromatic truffle oil and shavings...more on what we loved about Lelabar after the jump...I loved the rich muenster with freshly sliced apples drizzled with honey and paired with the Weingut Knoll Riesling. What a treat! Andrew was the perfect guide, asking our opinions and engaging us in conversation about what we were eating and drinking. After the tasting, we were all chatting and made new friends. It was such a casual, friendly environment for a tasting (not your typical cookie cutter wine bar or environment). After the tasting was over, we didn't want to leave the cozy wine bar. The room is filled with a gorgeous wraparound, oval-shaped bar that makes for a simple, yet elegant setting and invites conversation with neighboring guests. We loved how everyone who walked in the door seemed to be a regular (and Andrew seemed to know ALL of their names). Not only was Andrew a wonderful wine educator, he also makes you feel at home at Lelabar. Our other host for the evening and bartender was Emily. She was equally delightful and so helpful in guiding us to our favorite types of wines when we wanted to stay for a couple more glasses. Behind the central oval wine bar, Andrew and Emily were also preparing some amazing meals. I smelled the luscious white truffle oil being generously drizzled over the gruyere, ementhaler, and fontina pressed sandwich. It looked delicious. The goose liver pate served with fresh crispy bread looked ridiculously good-Emily saw me admiring the plate and gave me a bite to try... not to be missed. Not only is this a perfect spot to take a date or meet up with friends over a quality glass of wine, it is also a place to come and to relax.... to pass the time on a brisk Sunday afternoon and to have a light supper while supping on a spicy, rich glass of Tempranillo. We will certainly be back (a lot).

Starbucks To Launch Recession-Friendly Breakfast Value Meals

We had heard that Starbucks was considering making the move towards a breakfast value meal. It looks like it's now official. Come March 3rd, Starbucks around the nation will be offering \"breakfast pairings\" for $3.95 all day long that include your choice of a tall latte or tall coffee + a breakfast item (we hear options will include oatmeal, reduced-fat cinnamon swirl coffee cake, two new types of egg frittatas and a reduced-fat turkey bacon breakfast sandwich). No word yet if there will be a \"venti-size me\" upgrade option. The new breakfast pairings seem to be Starbucks answer to McDonald’s value meals. Not to mention McDonald's has announced plans to roll out an espresso-based coffee platform whose items are priced on average 50 cents or more below Starbucks’ offerings.

Finally, Some Color on the Houston's-Hillstone Situation

***CONTENT
We received the following comment from \"Employee\" over the weekend that helps clear up some of the mystery behind the Houston's to Hillstone Manhattan name change. Interestingly, the commenter does not deny that the name change may have had at least something to do with the NYC calorie posting laws: # Employee on 07 Feb 2009 at 5:02 am OK, so here’s the scoop from an employee. Our owner and founder, George Biel, started his concept with his first Houston’s restaurant in Tennessee over 30 years ago, and has since spread to bustling areas around the country. Houston’s is not his only restaurant. Others include Bandera Grill, Cherry Creek Grill, Rutherford Grill, Cafe R&D, and others. Please visit http://www.hillstone.com to see all our locations and menus. While our family of restaurants operate under the same code of ethics with regards to service and food preparation (utilizing local purveyors, offering great value for freshly in-house made food, choosing small-production wines for sale at far below industry standard mark-ups, etc), the reason for the different names is to reflect our collective family of restaurants. Hillstone is not something coined to mirror another company or brand. Rather, it is the name of George’s vineyard, and at the Lexington and 53rd location, we offer Hillstone wine among our by-the-bottle choices. Changing the name on the menu and what we’re calling ourselves at our two Manhattan locations allows us to introduce some menu options that may not be traditional Houston’s fare but can include some favorites from our other locations. For example, at my location, the Sashimi Tuna Salad we prepare differs from the recipe utilized at other near-by Houston’s, but is the same as is offered on the west coast. We also have a wonderful Corned Beef sandwich, we maintain several in-season vegetables daily and list them on the menu, and we prepare some of our steaks differently from other locations (broiled as opposed to grilled). By calling ourselves Hillstone, we are able to offer great selections from beyond just the Houston’s “catalog” of recipes, and as such, label our location with the same name as that which we ascribe to our collective family of restaurants. I think it’s a great way for guests to wonder “what is Hillstone?” and possibly introduce them to the rest of our restaurant family by bringing them to our website. Additionally, we are frequented by a number of tourists who have come to see NYC. Some don’t have a Houston’s near their home towns, but may be located near a Bandera Grill, or Cafe R&D, etc. Since Hillstone is the name of our family of restaurants, we are saying to them “come on in — you’ll get the same great service and quality of food.” On every paycheck, I and all other employees of Houston’s, Bandera, Rutherford, etc. see Hillstone, and have for several years. And as for the regulation on calorie posting, while our menu items are prepared according to standard recipes, ultimately the final products are graded on taste, and are often modified slightly to compensate for variations in fresh ingredients (”Hey, we need to add a little more lime juice to our Honey Lime Vinaigrette” for example). There is no central Houston’s (or Hillstone) factory where our food is prepared and shipped out, unlike most fast-food chains. We have been hearing about feedback on the web about calling our NYC stores Hillstone, and to be honest, it’s very exciting. We love to hear and know that our guests are so passionate about what we provide. Our business is hospitality, and we value everyone who chooses to dine in one of our restaurants. Ultimately, our goal is to continue providing great food at a great value with efficient service. Why would we want to upset our loyal fans? Hillstone is not a “rebranding.” We are merely highlighting the collective unity of all of George Biel’s restaurants, and continuing his dream.

i live in bethesda maryland. they also changed the name of the houston's here in bethesda to woodmont grill and changes some of the menu items. sadly, this houston's went downhill after the name change (i copy/paste a couple of reviews below from menupages). will be interesting to see if the nyc locations suffer, too.

Last week Fast Company reported that Chef Eric Ripert is working on a prepared food line to be sold in gourmet markets. Ripert quickly denied the report to the Feedbag: “It’s totally not true,” the Le Benardin chef says. “I mean…there’s not even any flirtation with anything like that. I have no idea what’s going on. Why can’t they call me and find out the fact before they report this? There’s not even…nothing! I haven’t thought about in all these many years. It’s totally not true.” W&D learned over the weekend that while Ripert may not have a line of prepared frozen foods in the works, Chefs Daniel Boulud and Thomas Keller already definitely do. We stumbled upon a website FiveLeaf and here's what we found...\"It's a once in a lifetime collaboration... FiveLeaf has teamed with seven of the world's greatest chefs to bring elite gourmet dining into one of your favorite places... home! Now all you have to do to experience a gourmet dinner prepared by Chefs Daniel Boulud, Mark Miller, Charlie Trotter, Thomas Keller, Antoine Westermann, Reine Sammut or Gerard Bertholon, is boil water. That's right, all you have to do is boil water and voilá you're enjoying international cuisine! Best of all, all FiveLeaf menu selections are delivered right to your front door, frozen and ready form our enjoyment. Boulud's \"menu\" includes Braised Beef Short Ribs with Red Wine Sauce and Salmon Escebeche. Keller's \"menu\" includes Mac & Cheese Lobster with Orzo. Oh, and if you have your own refrigerated truck, FiveLeaf is looking to hire an Exclusive Sales Rep. The listing on Craigslist says, \"We envision every neighborhood grocery store carrying these products in their freezers.\" We'll see about that.

The frozen meals prepared under the fiveleaf name are actually produced by a company called Cuisine Solutions in Alexandria, VA. Cuisine produces all their frozen entrees utilizing the Sous Vide Cooking method. If you picked up Under Pressure, Thomas Keller's new sous vide cookbook, there is a letter of introduction from Bruno Goussault, chief scientist Cuisine Solutions. Keller goes on to sing the praises of Cuisine Solutions and Chef Gerard Bertholon. To check out the parent of Five Leaf go to http://www.cuisinesolutions.com

You may no longer be able to expense your steak dinner or woo your dates with Foie Gras French Toast, but at least you can enjoy everything from a $69 bottle of Cakebread Cellars Sauvignon Blanc to wines well over $300 for half the price. Better yet, for those still in denial, you can impress your guests by ordering a $325 bottle of Meritage Cardinale from Sonoma, while knowing your check will only read $162.50.

W&D Sponsors 100% Halal & Healthy Food's 'Gino Sandwich' in The Midtown Lunch Sandwich Challenge

***CONTENT
Midtown Lunch, which has been a go-to website for me and thousands of others looking to find \"cheap, fast, interesting and good\" food for under $10 in Midtown, has put forth the following sandwich challenge to all restaurants and food carts in Midtown: \"Come up with a new sandwich. A bold sandwich. A sandwich that pushes the boundaries of what human beings were meant to ingest. And you shall call it the “Midtown Lunch Special”. Add this special sandwich to your menu (temporarily or permanently) and we will post about it on Midtown Lunch. That’s it.\" Only other rule -- charge under $10 for it. It's no secret that my favorite food cart in Midtown is the 100% Halal & Healthy Food, aka Cart with the Greek Salad, at the northwest corner of 55th and Park. Earlier this week, I spoke with Gamal, the man behind 100% Halal & Healthy, about the Midtown Lunch Sandwich Challenge and we brainstormed some ideas for his sandwich entry. We talked about him maybe doing a pita sandwich version of the famous Greek Salad w/ Grilled Chicken. Not creative enough we decided. It then dawned on us that what sets 100% Halal & Healthy apart from the competition, other than the Greek Salad, is its Kofta. For those who don't know, Kofta is basically a type of slider formed out of of minced or ground meat — usually beef or lamb — and mixed with spices and/or onions. Jamaal whipped up a test sandwich for me on a roll with kofta, grilled chicken, grilled onions and peppers, melted cheese, his famous thick hot sauce and some white sauce. There was born the \"Gino Sandwich\", aka the \"Kofta Kombination.\" We then discussed what he should charge for it. I told him part of the challenge is to offer the sandwich at the best price-point possible. Jamaal said he would charge just $5 for this massive combination sandwich, which is a steal. It's available starting TODAY. Go get you some! I had it on a roll, but I recommend going with a pita and feta cheese. I'll grab one for lunch and post some pics. I'm still trying to figure out where he got the name Gino.

Spoke to Gamal yesterday about where he got the name for the \"Gino\" sandwich. Apparently Gino was his childhood nickname so when I told him to think of a name for it, he said that was the first thing that popped into his head.

According to Nation's Restaurant News, there is an oyster boon on the eastern seaboard of the US. This is translating into restaurants getting great quality oysters at very low prices. You can therefore expect to see oysters making their way onto 'Recession Special' happy hour menus and deals. Also look for chefs to do some experimenting with creative preparations using oysters. We've already seen over the past couple of months a huge price drop in lobsters due to a lobster glut caused in part by Icelandic credit lines freezing up. We're keepin' an eye out for great deals on oysters around the city. Here are some we've already come across: Dock's Oyster Bar - $1 Oysters Mon-Fri 3-7pm. And you can also get 50 cent clams, $1.50 sliders, $7 martinis and half-off drinks. (3rd Ave @ 40th) Lelabar - $1 Oysters on Wednesday's and Saturday's at this W. Village wine bar. (Hudson @ Leroy)... Lure Fishbar - This could be the best Seafo0d Happy Hour in town. Mon-Fri 5-7pm. $1 fresh-shucked Oysters. Also $1 Clams. $6 martinis and specialty cocktails, $5 glasses of wine and $4 beers. (Mercer @ Prince). Ed's Lobster Bar - $2 Oyster Tuesday's. (Lafayette nr Spring) Essex - $1 Oysters all night on Monday's and Thursday's and 1/2 price drinks between 6-9pm. (Essex @ Rivington) McCormick & Schmick's - $1 Oysters on Monday nights.

SushiSamba Chicago has \"Sunday Funday\" Brunch w/ 3 Complimentary Cocktails: Why Not NYC?
***AUTHOR

***CONTENT
I noticed on the SushiSamba website this morning that SushiSamba Chicago is offering a \"Sunday Funday\" Samba Brunch. For $16 a person you get 3 complimentary brunch cocktails (mimosas, bloody's or caipirinhas) and a menu item. But where brunch reigns supreme here in NYC, SushiSamba offers nothing of the sort...not even close. All they offer is what they call a family-style brunch for $15 a person where you choose 4 menu items and you don't even get as much as 1 complimentary drink. Now, don't get me wrong. SushiSamba NYC locations are doing some very recession-friendly specials (like the Bailout Menu offered nightly where you get 3 courses + a cocktail for $35). I just think a Recession Brunch deal would be great, too. So I emailed the following to SushiSamba this morning to see if we can help change this... Hi, My website is Wined & Dined. Just wanted to touch base with you regarding something I noticed on the SushiSamba website. It's the Sunday Funday Brunch at the Chicago Rio location. It's a great deal, and I think this would be an amazing brunch offer to also have at the NYC locations. If it's too costly (difference in Chicago vs NYC rent, overhead, etc), perhaps you do 1 or 2 complimentary brunch cocktails instead of 3. With all of the NYC restaurants doing at least 1 complimentary brunch drink, i.e. B.R Guest restaurants like Dos Caminos for instance, I think it would tremendously help SushiSamba's brunch traffic and would also create a fun Sunday atmosphere at the restaurants. My wife and I would love to go to SushiSamba for Sunday brunches, but it just doesn't make sense and is hard for us to rationalize when so many other good places are offering at least 1 free brunch cocktail. Would love to promote this on Wined & Dined if it is something that SushiSamba NYC restaurants are willing to do. Best regards, Andy Freedman We will let you know what we hear back from SushiSamba.

NYC Is On Chick-fil-A's \"Radar\"
***AUTHOR

***CONTENT
I'm a native Atlantan and grew up eating Chick-fil-A. Whether a chicken biscuit for breakfast or a chicken filet sandwich combo with waffle fries for lunch, a week rarely went by when I wasn't making at least one pit stop at the location about a mile from my home. For the life of me, I cannot understand why there is still not a Chick-fil-A in NYC (other than that licensee location with the limited menu at NYU's Weinstein Food Court). Clearly New Yorkers would love to have Chick-fil-A's in Manhattan. Click here, here, here and here. As non-students in NYC, we have had to resort to sneaking into NYU's food court or falling back on McDonald's Southern Style Chicken knock-off of the famed Chick-fil-A Chicken Sandwich. So I decided to send an email to Chick-fil-A corporate to see why they don't have NYC locations and if any are planned in the near future. I even volunteered to franchise one. Here's the response I received... From: Chick-fil-A CARES To: Freedman, Andy Dear Mr. Freedman: Thank you for taking the time to contact Chick-fil-A. You are very important to us, and we appreciate knowing that New York residents are interested in Chick-fil-A. Currently, there are no definite plans to develop additional Chick-fil-A Restaurants in New York. The one location you mentioned is a licensee location at New York University (New York University, Weinstein Food Court, 5-11 University Place, New York, NY 10003; 212-995-3057). Chick-fil-A opens approximately 70 new Restaurants each year. We receive literally hundreds of requests from customers regarding possible locations at or near which they would like to see a Chick-fil-A Restaurant. Although we appreciate our customers’ input, our Chick-fil-A Restaurant new opening locations are determined internally through our own market research after thoughtful analysis. Please rest assured, however, that New York is on our radar, and we will forward your request to the appropriate parties within Chick-fil-A. We also appreciate your interest in franchising a Chick-fil-A. Our Franchisee Opportunity program is designed for individuals who desire to personally operate their own business but may lack the large capital outlay. A Chick-fil-A Operator/Franchisee manages the restaurant on a day-to-day basis and may not have any other active business venture other than the restaurant. Again, thank you for your time and interest in Chick-fil-A. Sincerely, Tamara Chick-fil-A CARES We'll keep you posted, but it does not seem there will be NYC Chick-fil-A relief anytime soon. Next up, Waffle House. SHARETHIS.addEntry({ title: \"NYC Is On Chick-fil-A's \"Radar\"\", url: \"http://www.winedanddined.com/2009/02/chic/\" });

I'm also an Atlantan who missed the Chick. Every time I fly down there, I hit the Dwarf House off 85 as I head north into the city. The trick is to create a true value proposition for Chick-fil-A, who, as a business, wants to make sure they are going to get a return on any store they open. I'd think some clever NYU business students could develop a business case that makes sense for the home office, right?

Thought you'd be interested in seeing this.

15% Off Tuesdays @ Astor Wines: Local New York Wines

Andy
***DATE
2009-02-03 04:17:00
***CONTENT
On Tuesday of each week, Astor Wines marks down all bottles of a selected region of wine by 15%. Up this week are wines from our own backyard. If you haven't tried Rieslings from the Finger Lakes or Cabernet Francs from the North Fork, this is your chance to pick up some good bottles on the cheap. It feels good to drink and learn about local wines, especially during tough economic times. I can promise you local winemakers are feeling the pain, too. If we don't support our local winemakers, then who's going to? I recommend picking up a bottle of the 2007 Dr. Konstantin Frank Dry Riesling at $16, a bottle of the 2005 Lenz Gewurtzraminer at $16, a bottle of the 2005 Wolffer Cabernet Franc for about $19, a bottle of the 2006 Hermann Wiemer Semi-Dry Riesling for $16, a bottle of the nice drinking, light table red 2006 Channing Daughters Rosso Fresco for $15 and a bottle of the 2007 Paumanok Chenin Blanc for $24. And if you're looking for more information on local New York wines, including wine reviews, Q&A's with winemakers and news from the NY wine regions, then head to Lenndevours.

I was just about to order in lunch to work on SeamlessWeb, when I noticed that they now have a 'Gift Certificate Program.' I decided to check it out and was immediately struck by the fact that these aren't gift certificates to your local delivery spots and diners, but to some of the city's top dining destinations. Here's how it works: you just enter your mailing address and then you can begin shopping for gift certificates on SeamlessWeb's fairly simple to use interface. The gift certificates come in $100 increments for only $70 each! They say that the gift certificate(s) will be mailed to you the next business day. Some of the restaurants included in this offer are Alto, Artisanal, Aquavit, Boqueria, Cafe des Artistes, davidburke and donatella, La Grenouille, landmarc, Lure Fishbar, Mai House, Picholine, Wd-50 and more. Caveat: Be sure to look at each restaurant's set of restrictions for use of their gift certificates. Most are not valid on V-Day and some restaurants only accept 1 gift certificate per visit.

On your recommendation, two girlfriends and I went to SavorNY for their \"buy 2 glasses, get the rest of the bottle free\" offer! Sadly, the owner failed to mention the offer which is slightly disingenuous but when we told him we knew of it, to be fair to him he actually recommended one of the best wines on the list. After drinking the maximum (of two bottles), we decided to start negotiating - after all there were only two other people in the restaurant!! It is a diners market these days ladies and gentlemen!!!! We said we wanted a third bottle at the same deal. While at first reluctant, the owner finally agreed on the basis we didn't tell anyone!! WHAT KIND OF BUSINESS SENSE DOES THAT MAKE??????!!!!! This is a great 'watering hole' and if the owner opened himself up to people and publicity a little more, this would also be a packed joint during this recession. Lets give credit where credit is due though - the food and the wine were great and at least this restaurant is open to negotiation unlike some others (no names for now)!!!!!

Boozy Brunch: Il Bastardo
***AUTHOR
Jill
***DATE
2009-01-30 18:10:00
***CONTENT
After recently hitting up the very budget friendly boozy brunch at Roberto Passon, we decided to hit up another New York City Restaurant Group all-you-can-drink brunch spot this past weekend. We were headed to the west side for the Cochon 555 event, so we decided to first check out Il Bastardo in Chelsea (191 7th Ave btw 21st & 22nd). Did Lauren and Whitney's visit on the Hills and all the recent attention to this neighborhood staple change the brunch scene, or more importantly the brunch prices? First of all, we noted that it was a lot more crowded than normal. Our friend Leena had introduced this AYCD brunch to us a couple of years ago and it used to be only really packed on those beautiful sunny days when you can take full advantage of their al fresco dining. We were happy to see it doing so well, even if the place was packed with Lauren Conrad wannabees. Secondly, the add-on all-you-can-drink option is now $15 (I vaguely remember it being less) and all of the menu items seem to be a couple dollars more. This is certainly more than Roberto Passon's $8 AYCD and brunch entrees under $12, but it still could be a deal (depending on how many mammouth size glasses of bubbly, mimosas, screwdrivers, or bloody marys you can put back). I had the Chicken Caesar salad for $10 and Andy had the Omelette with Virginia ham, sauteed mixed mushrooms, and he added on mozzarella for $9. We both had the AYCD special at $15 a person and we tried a side of broccoli rabe at $7. Jill's Caesar Salad I love their Caesar salad- there is a ton of the chicken paillard and it is pounded perfectly paper thin and topped with freshly ground black pepper. The parmesan slices are also fresh, thin, and plentiful. The dresssing is not overly creamy and has nice acidic balance. Andy's omelette was awesome! Strangely, it came out looking more like a frittata than an omelette, but the flavors did not disappoint. He never eats the potatoes (watching out for those pesky carbs) but he finished them all this time- either he was very hungry or they were VERY good. Andy's Omelette Frittata Lastly, our broccoli rabe was lovely- great garlic potency without being too oily. I don't think the serving size was necessarily worth $7 for a brunch side, though. All in all, we were very happy with the food but we were even more happy with the service. Everytime I put a dent in my giant (and I mean giant- no flutes here) glass of champagne, our waiter came by, bottle in hand, and topped me off. You can't go wrong on a relaxing Sunday afternoon at a place with the background music of corks popping ever few minutes. Now, for our next AYCD brunch... any ideas?

Wildwood Adds Free Drink to Brunch Menu: The \"BBQ Blues Brunch\"

***CONTENT
Beginning Sunday, February 8th, Wildwood starts a \"Sunday BBQ Blues Brunch\" with Rock and Roll and Blues bands from 12-4 pm (225 Park Ave. South @ 18th). W&D had posted about most of the B.R. Guest restaurants adding a complimentary drink to their brunch menus (we're talking bloody marys, not teas or coffees), but Wildwood was one of two that hadn't. When we were there for brunch a couple of weeks ago, we chatted with the very nice and beer-savvy manager and asked about the lack of complimentary brunch drink. We were very excited to see today that the policy has changed and that they are now offering \"a complimentary 'Cold Ass Beer,' Champagne Punch, or House Bloody Mary\" with the purchase of a brunch entree (that means no free drink with the classic BBQ lunch menu). 'Ask and you shall receive' is what we're learning here. I'm sure looking forward to the Southside Benedict (with buttermilk biscuits and chipotle hollandaise and cheddar grits) and a \"Cold Ass Beer\" for $11, although it will be tough to resist the Applewood Smoked Chicken with a side of crispy brussel sprouts, onions & bacon from the normal menu. Can't have it all...

Your One-Stop Shop for Restaurant YEAR: The List of RW Extensions Grows

The trend is spreading like wildfire. With NYC Restaurant Week winding down and the economic outlook remaining bleak at best, restaurants are extending their Restaurant Week menus left and right. While Restaurant Week organizer NYC & Co. has sent out a note to see if participating restaurants would be willing to extend through February, nothing has been made official yet. IT'S OFFICIAL! Some restaurants couldn't didn't even wait and pre-extended their RW menus. Our readers have been asking us to compile a comprehensive list of restaurants that have extended Restaurant Week to Restaurant Year, or to sometime in between. So, here's your complete, up-to-the-minute guide to NYC Restaurant Year. We expect there will be many more, but these are the ones we know about now: 21 Club - Extended through February 27th. And don't forget you don't have to wear a tie anymore and you can get free parking at a nearby garage from 4 p.m. to 1 a.m, a complimentary cocktail if you reserve through the restaurant's website, and a gift certificate for 20% off from February 1 through May 31. 5 Ninth - Extended through February 27th. And by the way, looks like a pretty good happy hour special Sun-Wed from 4-8pm when you can get $3 drafts, $5 selected wine, $5 well liquor and FREE PIGS IN THE BLANKET! L'Absinthe - Extends Restaurant Week permanently! According to Jaunted, its three-course prix fixe dinner menu (available Monday-Friday) is $30.09. And it's not one of those extremely limited RW menus, either. There are four-to-five choices in each course, and with offerings like salmon tartare, pike quenelles in lobster broth, and fresh profiterolles with vanilla ice cream, you really are getting a meal that would normally run $50 or more. Aquavit - Extending in both the Cafe and Dining Room through February 27th. Apiary - Extending through Labor Day. The Restaurant Week prix-fixe menu will be available Sun-Thurs with no time restrictions AND Monday nights are BYO with no-corkage fee. Helluva deal here. For more Restaurant Week extensions... Abboccato - Extended through February 27th. Artisanal - Extended through end of 2009. And Artisanal has agreed to offer a Cheese Plate (their bread and butter) as a dessert option. Asia de Cuba - Per comment from the general manager below, we learned that Asia de Cuba is extending Restaurant Week through the end of March (lunch Mon-Fri and dinner Sun-Fri). Atlantic Grill - Extended through February 27th. And now includes Saturday's, too, but not V-Day. Barbetta - Extended through February 27th. Barbounia - Extended through February 27th. Bice - Extended through February 27th. Black Duck - Extended through February 27th. Bar Boulud - Extended through February 27th (Mon-Fri lunch only). Beacon - Extended through February 27th. Oh, and don't forget about Beacon's Sunday Brunch with $11 bottomless Bloody Mary's or the Sunday Supper (3 courses for $44) with 30 wines under $30 or BYO (no corkage fee). Benoit - Extended through February 27th. Blue Fin - Extended through February 27th. And now includes Saturday's, too, but not V-Day. Blue Water Grill - Extended through February 27th. And now includes Saturday's, too, but not V-Day. Cafe Boulud - Extended for lunch through February 27th. Cafe des Artistes - Extending through end of 2009.

Vento does not offer the Sunday Night Special during Restaurant Week. I went last week and I was very disappointed.
Andy

Hi Dena- I just spoke with a manager at Vento. They re-confirmed that they are extending Restaurant Week through the end of February. They said that they do not offer other specials in combination with Restaurant Week, which is confusing since they have been publicizing the Sunday night deal. I asked what they plan to do with the Sunday Night Special now that they have extended Restaurant Week through February. They said that it's being tabled until March 1st. Sorry that you didn't tknow this before heading there, but thanks for the comment. Now lots of others can know before they go and not be similarly disappointed.

Asia de Cuba at Morgans Hotel (237 Madison Ave btwn 37th and 38th) will extend Restaurant Week until the end of March. Lunch $24.07 Monday-Friday Dinner $35 Sunday-Friday (no RW menu on Saturdays) Please call 212-726-7755 to reserve, or look us up on Open Table.

Thanks John! Was just about to reach out to Tribeca Grill and owners Myriad Restaurant Group (also Nobu, Centrico, Mai House). Heard all of these restaurants are doing great RW meals, which makes sense since Myriad Restaurant Group partner Tracy Nieporent is also the Chairman of the NYC & Company Restaurant Committee, the parent and sponsor of the event. They have to be doing great Restaurant Week stuff at their restaurants and the reviews have been reflecting that.

I've heard only negative reviews on dovetail, but naougatine, bar boulud, aquavit, le cirque are all recommended. Primehouse is an decent steakhouse, but not great by NY standards. But if steak is what you're looking for, its the best on this list.

Rayuela, as opposed to what was stated by Andy, did extend restaurant week menu until the end of February...and honestly is one of the restaurants that really put some serious thoughts in the menu that they created for RW!
Waldy Malouf
2009-02-04 22:18:00
Beacon Restaurant (25 West 56th Street, 212 332 0500) has also extended for every day until February 27th.

2009-02-05 04:38:00
@ Whitman - Thanks for the heads-up on Rayuela extending RW through Feb. I stand corrected. When I spoke with a manager last week on the phone, the response I got was that they would not be extending RW. Glad they had a change of heart. Rayuela's RW menu is not on the official RW website, so click here: http://www.rayuelanyc.com/restaurantweek.htm

As you can see, some are extending restaurant week. Some great deals also exist for happy hours. Add to your list \"lure fishbar\". Best oysters in town. The Modern stuffy. But anything with Boulud's touch is great. Gramacy tavern, the best.

Eleven Madison Park Will Not Be Extending its Restaurant Week Lunch

Sadly, we just heard from Eleven Madison Park that it does not plan to extend its famed Restaurant week lunch. It is still, however, the Hero of Restaurant Week in our mind. Consider the following: (i) its one of the few restaurants to include an amuse bouche with its RW menu, (ii) each Restaurant Week patron received a $28 gift card and (iii) we just read on this Serious Eats post that EMP offered the Restaurant Week menu for dinner to two diners who did not realize that it was lunch only! Amazing. Who does that? Danny Meyer is a true mensch and other restaurants around the city should take a cue from his Union Square Hospitality Group, which always puts its customers first. Bravo!

Here is what's making the news on this snowy Wednesday morning in NYC: As W&D predicted back in December, beer is becoming the new wine for 2009 as customers seek out 'comfort' during the recession, with high-end restaurants such as Daniel, Blue Hill, Aquavit, Rock Center Cafe and Hearth all recently hosting beer-pairing dinners. Not to mention Brooklyn Brewery is brewing a Blue Apron Ale exclusively for Per Se. Daniel Boulud's new Bowery beer brasserie slated to open this spring is tentatively being named DBGB Kitchen & Bar and beer will be served not in pitchers, but in liter and magnum size carafes. And like us, Daniel drinks Dogfish Head. [NYP] Breaking News from Across the Pond: Street Meat is Unhealthy with a \"Shocking\" Load of Fat and Salt. [Reuters] John Doherty, executive chef at The Waldorf-Astoria, said Tuesday he has left the landmark hotel after 20 years to form a restaurant development company. [Nation's Restaurant News] Zak Pelaccio's Mexican spot Cabrito, which could have also been named the 'Fatty Goat', receives the 1-spot from Bruni. As you would expect, Cabrito does not suffer from a lack of flavor, but there are some \"misses\" there according to Bruni. He does rave about the Rajas con crema, tongue and tomatillo, chorizo and huitlacoche huaraches, shrimp and tamarind ceviche, carnitas and short ribs in red chili. But not blown away by the guac or braised spare ribs. [NYT] Despite what we've been hearing about Gordon Ramsay's crumbling restaurant empire, the $1900/dinner chef's table at Gordon Ramsay at The London NYC is booked solid weekly according to Executive Chef Josh Emmit.

When Bad Names Happen to Great Deals

This could be the worst name yet ever for the name of a special dinner. We got an email earlier from Zagat informing us about the Wine-lentines's Seduction Dinner @ Brasserie Cognac. Yeah, you read that correctly. Wine-lentine's. What we have here is an amazing deal with a horrendous name. The deal is $49 per person for a 5-course meal with wine pairings (tax and tip not included). Apparently, each course and its wine highlight a romantic moment – from the early bubbles of new love to the seal of a goodnight kiss – in dishes like foie gras terrine with a rose and raspberry macaroon. To reserve your space at this terribly-named dinner, call 212-757-3600 and mention \"Zagat Presents.\" We are trying to find out who exactly came up with the name and who signed off on it. You have to wonder if they even tried saying it a few times first. Did they select this name among other options? Could anything be worse? Let's see if we can help them come up with something better. Leave a comment with your suggested name for this deal and we'll see if the good folks over at Zagat will do themselves, Brasserie Cognac and everyone else a favor and switch the name to their favorite of the suggestions. Our suggestion: The \"Anything Other Than Wine-lentine's Seduction Dinner\" Dinner. Or what about the \"Wined & Dined Seduction Dinner\"?

The Blazer Burger: Worth the Trip?

***CONTENT
I have very fond memories of family dinners at the Blazer Pub up in Westchester County. The Blazer Pub, known by many to have the best burger in Westchester, is located on Route 22 in Purdys, New York. It is a family-owned, classic roadhouse that has been around for longer than I have been around. We took a trip up to the Blazer for a visit with my mom and sisters and so that I could introduce Andy to one of my favorite childhood spots. Was it really as good as I had remembered? Continue reading for the verdict... Yes! It was as wonderful as I remembered. The large U-shaped packed bar with Captain Lawrence on tap, the red oilcloths covering the tables, the old school video games, the most friendly service imaginable, and most importantly the juicy, thick, round burgers. Maybe I am biased, because I have grown up with these serious patties, but nothing beats biting into a Blazer Celsus Burger with melted Swiss and bacon as the bun disintegrates in your fingers from all the juices dripping from your bite marks. AND the massive homemade steak fries. I am not even sure where they find potatoes so large to make them. It was such a treat! We started by the bar, because even on a Saturday afternoon the Blazer was busy as ever. Once we were seated we ordered the Blazer Onion- their version of a blooming onion- greasy and satisfying. I had the soup of the day- a classic New England clam chowder- good, but nothing exceptional. My sister, Ann, ordered the homemade chili (always better when topped with chopped red onions, cheese, and sour cream). Now for the main attraction. My burger was excellent. It was just as thick as I had remembered. The Swiss cheese covered my round patty and two thick strips of bacon balanced on top. After adding my ketchup, tomato, and onions, it was nearly impossible to fit the tower of a burger into my mouth. My medium-rare burger was more medium than rare, but it was delicious and juicy. The bun was just as I had remembered, classic and disintegrating into the burger. A couple of burgers at our table were overdone (Andy's medium rare looked medium well), but the server was sweet and accommodating and had another one made with a smile. We had a large order of the huge Blazer fries for the table (a must!). They are so giant that at times, you feel like you're eating a baked potato instead of a fry, but they are crispy on the outside and I just love them. It was all in all a perfect and very filling trip down memory lane. Yep, it was worth the trip. More pics below. Tip- Cash Only.

Going Hog Wild at Cochon 555

***CONTENT
After an all-you-can-drink brunch at Il Bastardo, we headed over yesterday afternoon to the Hiro Ballroom at the Maritime Hotel for the Cochon 555 event. Cochon 555 is a culinary event featuring 5 chefs, 5 heritage pigs and 5 winemakers with the chefs squaring off in a friendly competition for a good cause. It started with a pre-party in the upstairs lounge where guests enjoyed an array of delicious cheeses courtesy of Saxelby Cheesemongers, a variety of creative cocktails using Canton ginger liquer, salads made with Greg's Hemp Oil Vinaigrette and Ranch dressings, an assortment of wines (including Kosta Browne pinot noir and Slaughterhouse Cabernet Sauvignon), and a cask of Dogfish Head 60-minute IPA. A little before 4pm, the judges were led to their chambers to taste and vote. The event, which benefits City Harvest, is the brainchild of Brady Lowe. It all started in Atlanta where Brady is from and has grown to become an 11-city event. All-in-all this was a flawlessly planned event thanks in large part to the work of Brady's right-hand-woman, Carolina Uribe. The 5 chefs for the NYC stop included Mark Ladner (Del Posto), Juan Jose Cuevas (eighty one), Bobby Hellen (Resto), farmer Michael Clampffer (Mosefund Farm) and Corwin Kave (Fatty Crab). The 5 wineries included local Channing Daughters , with winemaker Christopher Tracy on-hand, and Pax Wine Cellars. Needless to say, we definitely got more than our money's worth. For some reason everyone at the event thought I was the owner of Pork Slap beer because I was wearing a Pork Slap t-shirt. In fact, several people came up to me and asked if we brew our beer with pork juice. Each chef was given a different breed of heritage pig to work with (approx 70 lbs). Team eighty one did some delicious pork meatballs with cuttlefish, trotter-sweetbread-and-lobster cake with tarragon sauce, a series of terrines and a slice of porchetta. One team did a delicious pork broth soup. In the end, it was Team Fatty Crab taking the grand prize with their amazing smoked pork that was adorned with a spicy cilantro. Fatty Crab chef and owner Zakary Pelaccio was on-hand and one has to think that his bbq joint, which is slated to open in Brooklyn later this year, is going to also be a winner. Praise the lard! .gallery { margin: auto; } .gallery-item { float: left; margin-top: 10px; text-align: center; width: 33%; } .gallery img { border: 2px solid #cfcfcf; } .gallery-caption { margin-left: 0; } Brady Lowe welcoming the guests Saxelby Cheeses Me and Ms. Dogfish Head Am I allowed to be doing this?

There are so many food, wine and beer events this time of year it's getting pretty hard to select which ones to attend. Here's what we have on tap for this weekend, as well as a couple of events and tastings we can't unfortunately get to: Friday Night - Dinner with friends at The John Dory (unfortuantely no 'Recession Specials' here) Saturday Afternoon - Heading to The Blazer Pub in Purdys, NY to try what we've heard is the best burger in Westchester Other Saturday Afternoon Events -- If we weren't going to The Blazer we'd be heading to the 5th Annual Cask Ale Festival at the Blue Point Brewery (sold out) OR over to Park Slope to taste some Sixpoint beer at GRAB Specialty Foods (4-6pm) OR to wine store Acker Merrall & Condit for a free Opus One tasting (2-5pm) Sunday -- Heading to the Cochon 555 event (5 Chefs, 5 Pigs (not including me) & 5 Winemakers) at the Hiro Ballroom in the Maritime Hotel where a group of top New York City chefs will be preparing a heritage breed hog from head to toe and guests and professional judges will taste and determine a winner based on creativity, classic preparation and overall best flavor. The winner will be crowned the “Prince of Porc”. In addition, five family-owned wineries will showcase their wines plus we hear that they will be serving some Dogfish Head beer. You can still get your tickets here for $125. Other Sunday Afternoon Events -- If we weren't going to Cochon 555, we would definitely be heading out to Blue Hill @ Stone Barns for the 4th Annual Sausage & Beer Dinner featuring fresh and cured sausages and meats, all paired with a selection of locally brewed beers. The cost is $190 exclusive of tax and gratuity. Communal seating for everyone. Blue Hill's NYC location is holding a similar dinner on Monday night for $150 a head.

The year 1964 created a lasting impact upon America: the Ford Mustang was introduced, Beatlemania reached the States and the first Benihana restaurant introduced the nation to Japanese cuisine. To commemorate 45 years as the world's Japanese restaurant leader, Benihana treats guests to a $45 Dinner for Two Anniversary Special beginning January 5 and continuing throughout 2009. Customers will receive the Chicken, Shrimp and Beef Julienne combination entrée for two, each served with Japanese onion soup, Benihana salad, shrimp appetizer, hibachi vegetables, steamed rice, Japanese green tea and ice cream, all for just $45 plus tax. The website says the special is only available at participating locations. We'll let you know if it's on at the Benihana on 56th b/t 5th and 6th. If they say it's not, as you're probably starting to realize by now, we'll try to change that for you.

B.R. Guest Latest to Respond With a Restaurant Week \"Substitution Special\"

Last week we called upon restaurants participating in Restaurant Week to allow customers ordering off the RW menu to substitute a glass of wine for the dessert course (sorry to all you pastry chefs and dessert bloggers out there). The response so far has been great. We just received an email earlier this afternoon that B.R. Guest's Wildwood Barbeque has responded to our call-to-action with a \"Substitution Special.\" Customers will have the option to choose a mug of Wildwood's \"Cold Ass Beer\" or a glass of featured wine in place of an appetizer or dessert course at both lunch and dinner. Have a look at Wildwood's Restaurant Week menus here for lunch and here for dinner. This deal just got pretty good. For $35, we'd definitely head to Wildwood for a choice of soup or salad, choice of skirt steak, smoked cornish hen or apple stuffed pork loin + a mug of beer or glass of wine. Sorry dessert, we're just not feelin' ya. Oh yeah, almost forgot to mention that other B.R. Guest restaurants around town (Atlantic Grill, Blue Fin, Blue Water Grill, Isabella's, Ocean Grill and Vento) are offering select bottles of wine for $20.09 at lunch and $35 at dinner.

We've told you about the burger + beer deals at The Smith and Clinton St. Baking Co. Now, others are getting into the act. Here's your guide to all the Burger + Beer deals around the city: Bar Stuzzichini (Broadway nr 22nd): Burger + a Peroni for $15 at the bar and bar tables (lunch and dinner). It's a great deal because a burger is usually $12 and a Peroni is usually $8. Choice Kitchen & Cocktails (3rd b/t 27th and 28th St.): Burger, fries and a beer for only $9 on Monday nights. Clinton St. Baking Co. & Restaurant (Clinton b/t Houston and Stanton): Burger + Beer for $12 (6-8pm Mon-Sat). It's a great deal because a burger is usually $14 and a beer is $7. Community Food & Juice (Broadway b/t 112th and 113th): Burger + Beer for $15 (6-7pm Mon-Thurs). It's a great deal because a burger is usually $14 and a beer is $6.75 -- not too mention they have Sixpoint Sweet Action. Several more Burger + Beer specials after the jump... Irving Mill (16th nr Irving Pl): Burger + Sixpoint Beer for $15 every Monday. It's a great deal because the mixture of 70% 50/50 Niman Ranch flap steak that is aged for 5 weeks and whole beef cheek with 30% pork fatback burger that has left the likes of Bruni and Ed Levine swooning is usually $15 on its own and because we love Sixpoint Beers (which would usually be $8). The beer is the Sixpoint Brownstone. In fact, this Monday the 26th we hear a Sixpoint rep will be on-hand. We'll be there, too. I have to say I was not as enamored as others with the Skeen Burger my first go around and am looking forward to getting back in there and trying it again. Jerry's Cafe (Chambers b/t Church and Broadway): 8oz. Burger + Beer or Glass of Wine for $8. It's a great deal because the Jerry's 8oz. Burger is usually $13 on its own and Beers are $5. Not sure how long this deal is lasting. We'll find out and get back to ya. Paris Commune (Bank St. nr Greenwich St. in W. Village): Complimentary beer with your burger everyday before 7pm Prune (1st nr First): $15 Burger + Beer Bloody Mary Deal. Mon - Fri, 5:30 - 7:30. The Smith (3rd b/t 10th and 11th): Burger + Beer on Sunday's after 5pm for $12 $14. I think they upped the price by a couple of bucks recently, but still a pretty darn good deal. Great beer selection that includes Sixpoint Bengali Tiger IPA and Peak Organic Espresso Amber Ale. It's a great deal because a burger is usually $14 on its own and a Beer is usually $6. Stand (12th b/t Univ Pl and 5th): 2 for 1 Burgers everyday b/t 3-5pm or get a free Beer with your Burger everyday b/t 5-7pm. Stand has great beers on tap. Click here to see for yourself.

We just got word of this Mon-Fri 5:30-7:30pm Happy Hour 'Recession Special' at Ono at Hotel Gansevoort. At the O-Bar and Cocktail Lounge all of the following items will be $7 -- Sushi Rolls, Red + White Wine, Sake, Beer, Specialty Cocktails and Martinis. Not bad!

As Expected, Daniel Gets a 4-Spot From Bruni

***DATE
2009-01-21 07:44:00
***CONTENT
The review is out. Bruni has revisited Daniel for the NYTimes, this time after the restaurant's massive (and massively expensive) makeover. He begins, \"If you haven’t dined at Daniel in the last four and a half months, you haven’t dined at Daniel.\" And the best news is that there is perhaps no better time to dine at Daniel. Despite undoubtedly trying to recoup its sizeable investment in the re-design, Daniel is offering a 3-course $98 \"Anniversary/Recession Special\" that includes wine pairings (Mon-Thurs 5:30-6:30). Bruni's Daniel experience was not perfect, however. He writes, \"I had a few entrees, like bacon-wrapped monkfish with tough lobster in the middle, that lacked almost any inspiration or finesse. The kitchen made basic missteps, like overcooking the chop in that beguiling lamb tableau.\" Perhaps Bruni was too overtaken by the decor to penalize the food. He almost admits as much when he says: \"Daniel was always fancy; now it’s genuinely gorgeous, too. And that’s almost reason enough to reaffirm the four stars the restaurant was awarded by William Grimes in The New York Times in 2001.\" The only question we have for Daniel is why Wined & Dined commenter jackieono was not offered the $98 Anniversary Special back on January 14, 2009 at her 6pm reservation. She had heard about the special 3-course prix fixe and according to a comment she left on our site it was never presented to her party as an option. For those interested, you can read the NYTimes 2001 Daniel review here.

Drink Obama Beers Tonight: Ommegang's Inauguration Ale (aka, Obamagang) & Sixpoint's Hop Obama

We just got news that Cooperstown, NY brewer Ommegang has unveiled a special Obama Beer to commemorate today's inauguration. You can try Ommegang's Obamagang tonight at NYC beer bars Hop Devil Grill and David Copperfield's. According to BeerMenus you can also get your Obamagang (6.2% abv) fix at Puck Fair and Rattle 'n' Hum. Brooklyn-based brewer Sixpoint Craft Ales unleashed its Hop Obama several months ago. You can find this one at Cherry Tree Bar and PDT. Here is a description of the Obamagang that we received by email: The TTB won’t let us call the beer Obamagang on the keg label. So it will be known legally as Inauguration Ale 2009, but the tap handles will be more...um...direct. The style lies between a porter and stout, with a bit of Kriek and a touch of chocolate blended in. It will be on draft only, beginning with the inauguration - in limited areas including DC, NYC, Syracuse, Philly, Chicago and Boston. We will donate a percentage of sales to charities in the respective cities where the beer is sold, and we’ve asked our distributors to match our donations and pick the local charities. (Also please note that the beer is not an endorsement of Obama.)

Unfortunately, Hop Obama is probably not available anywhere. PDT and Cherry Tree's beer menus are out of date. Sixpoint stopped making Hop Obama a while ago and it is not available anywhere we know of. I had the Obamagang tonight thought and it is great. A nice dark stout-like brew with hints of cherry.

BYO Goes High-End: Alto First to \"Un-Wined\" the Paradigm
***AUTHOR
Andy
***DATE
2009-01-20 11:07:00
***CONTENT
First it was a slew of \"Recession Specials\", then it was the migration from a \"Restaurant Week\" to a \"Restaurant Year,\" now it appears the latest move by high-end restaurants and restaurateurs to adapt to these ever-worsening economic conditions is to soften their BYO policy. It is certainly true that restaurants with expensive and extensive wine lists do not normally encourage or allow customers to \"bring their own.\" To discourage this, most high-end restaurants charge an exhorbitant \"corkage fee,\" as high as $95 at some restaurants. Now that there are fewer and fewer customers, it appears the rules may be changing. We just read this story in the NY Post that Alto is waiving its $60 corkage fee on any bottle of wine between now and September (1 bottle per table). Why is it especially significant and why do we feel this move by Alto will shift the paradigm, you ask? Consider that Alto was just 1 of 3 recipients in 2008 of the highly coveted Wine Spectator Grand Award (click on the image). The Grand Award recognizes wine lists with upwards of 1,500 selections that exhibit vintage depth as well an excellent breadth of major wine growing regions. In fact, only 72 restaurants worldwide hold this distinction. So, if Alto with its WS Grand Award and a 3-star NY Times review is feeling the pain, we have no doubt that other high-end restaurants are feeling it, too. As an advocate of diner interests, Wined & Dined is going to begin reaching out to other NYC restaurants to see if they will follow suit and waive their BYO corkage fee for customers. We will begin with Drew Nieporent's Myriad Restaurant Group (Corton, Tribeca Grill, Centrico, and Mai House). Why this restaurant group? Because Myriad is also the owner of one of our favorite wine shops in the city, Crush Wine & Spirits. I'm sure they can think of a creative way to drive traffic (and bottles of wine) from Crush to one of the Myriad restaurants around the city. We think it makes pretty good sense for Myriad to waive corkage fees on any bottles of wine purchased at its sister wine shop. We'll let you know what they say. Apparently, Nieporent and other restaurateurs are no stranger to softening their BYO policy during hard economic times. We dug up this NY Times piece from 2003 when in the wake of the bursting of the dot-com bubble, restaurants around the city switched gears and allowed customers to bring in their own wine without a fee. One of those restaurants was Montrachet, a former Myriad Group restaurant. According to the 2003 NY Times story, one restaurant that does not allow customers (other than Robert Parker, Jr.) to bring their own wine (even for a corkage fee) is Daniel and according to another NY Post BYO story from May 2008, neither do Del Posto, BLT Steak or Cru. We'll also reach out to them and see if perhaps they will change their minds now. And for all the diners out there who are hesitant to bring their own wine for fear of backlash from the server, remember this: a tip on a smaller bill is better than no tip at all!

You may already know by now that The Sunburnt Cow in the way East Village is one of Jill and my favorite all-you-can-drink Sunday Fun-Day brunch spots in the city. We just got an email from Team Sunburnt Cow-Bondi Road that there will be huge parties at both restaurants next Monday in celebration of Australia Day. Also known as Anniversary Day, Foundation Day and Invasion Day, Australia Day is the official national day of Australia. Celebrated annually on January 26th, the day commemorates the arrival of the First Fleet in 1788, marking the start of British colonization of Australia. There are 2 ways to party at The Sunburnt Cow and Bondi Road next Monday: they are offering an $18 \"Endless Brunch\" featuring endless breakfast cocktails and Foster's and a $20=2 Hours of drinking as much as you can. Only problem is that we have to work. Maybe Australia Day and MLK Day will coincide one of these years.

More Restaurant Week \"Substitution Specials\": Chinatown Brasserie Joins Growing List

We received an email over the weekend that the owners of Chinatown Brasserie have agreed to give diners a choice of a glass of wine in place of the dessert course, with the purchase of a glass of wine, a deal that we're calling the \"Substitution Special.\" Here's how it works: instead of choosing a dessert from the menu you can order any wine by the glass off the wine list and you will get 2 glasses with your dinner for the price of 1. Pretty darn good deal for wine drinkers! So, say you're out to dinner with a friend at Chinatown Brasserie and decide to order off the Restaurant Week menu. Your friend likes Sauvignon Blanc and orders a glass of the Francis Coppola ($10/glass) and you go with the Slipstream Shiraz ($11/glass). For $21, you will be getting 4 glasses total, or the equivalent of a bottle (perhaps more if you have a heavy-handed bartender)! RW dinner for 2 with equivalent of bottle of wine for $91 before tax and tip.

Hats off to Cafe des Artistes! Not only are they offering Restaurant Week all year long, they sent us a response email this morning saying that our proposal to see if any restaurants would substitute a glass of wine for the dessert course is \"a great idea!\" and \"that they would love to do it....\" We are trying to get the specifics of what Cafe des Artistes will allow diners to substitute for the dessert course, but it certainly appears that they are agreeing to a glass of wine. We're also trying to discover whether this \"substitution special\" will apply for their Restaurant Year or just during the next 2 weeks of Restaurant Week. We'll keep you posted as we learn more.

We received another response to our request sent out yesterday to see which restaurants participating in Restaurant Week would be willing to provide some alternative to diners who do not typically eat a dessert course. As if Terrance Brennan's Artisanal didn't announce enough good stuff yesterday (click here to see Grub Street's report that Artisanal has expanded with a Monday 'comfort food night' and is also adding a grilled cheese bar), we received an email this morning from Team Artisanal-Picholine that \"In lieu of the dessert course, guests at Artisanal during restaurant week can choose a Cheese Plate that will include an Aged Cheddar from Vermont and a Mimolette from France served with Walnut Chutney\" AND \"is offering all dinner guests during RW (not lunch) a $25 gift card to Artisanal's sister restaurant, Picholine.\" We reported last week that Picholine has expanded its 'Recession Special' menu, aka its Menu d'Economie.

Tired of going to dozens and dozens of individual restaurant websites to see who's offering what on their Restaurant Week menu? While the official Restaurant Week website does make available menus for about 80 of the participating restaurants here, there are more than 250 restaurants participating this year. As the start of RW draws nearer, more and more restaurants have been updating their websites with their RW menus. Here are the ones we've found so far (that you won't find on the official Restaurant Week website): Amma: lunch / dinner (note the $25 wine flight offer for lunch and dinner) Apiary: dinner Asia de Cuba: lunch / dinner (note that Asia de Cuba is making its RW menus available after RW through March 31st -- but dinner menu will only be available Sun-Wed) See more RW menus, after the jump... Asiate: Lunch only. From reviews we've read, Asiate is one of the few restaurants that does not change its menu for RW, which is nice. Outside of RW, Asiate offers a 2-course lunch for $24 w/ desserts offered at an additional $12. Throwing in dessert (though you know how we feel about this) truly makes Asiate one of the better RW lunch deals. Not to mention it's the best view you'll have at any RW restaurant. Here's the usual lunch menu, courtesy of NY Mag. August: Scroll down here for the lunch / dinner RW menu Bar Milano: appears to be a mistake that Bar Milano is listed as a participating restaurant -- they are presently closed and re-opening as 'inoteca in february Barbounia: Lunch / Dinner Beacon: Lunch / Dinner (note these are listed as the prix-fixe lunch and dinner menus on Beacon's website -- we are confirming that they are also the RW prix-fixe menus) Ben Benson's: Lunch Brasserie: Lunch / Dinner (don't forget all bottles of wine are 25%, i.e. they should cost just about what you pay for them at your local wine store) Brasserie 8 1/2: Lunch / Dinner (same goes here for 25% off all bottles of wine) Butter: Lunch / Dinner (look at bottom right of website and you'll see links to the RW menus) Cafe Centro: Lunch / Dinner (same goes here for 25% off all bottles of wine) Cafe D'Alsace: Lunch / Dinner Cafe des Artistes: Dinner (offering its $35 dinner prix-fixe all year long!) Capsouto Freres: Lunch / Dinner Center Cut: Lunch / Dinner (this is the type of RW menu we like to see...a steak offered that would be $36 on its own, then soup + salad + sides -- Hats off to the Chod!) Centovini: Dinner Centro Vinoteca: Lunch / Dinner Chin Chin: Lunch / Dinner China Grill: Lunch / Dinner (like the Chod's other restaurants, RW is being extended until March 31st -- lunch Mon-Fri and dinner Sun-Wed) Del Posto: Lunch only Dovetail: Lunch only EN Japanese Bistro: Dinner only Fig & Olive: Lunch / Dinner Hudson Cafeteria: Lunch / Dinner(like the Chod's other restaurants, RW is being extended until March 31st -- lunch Mon-Fri and dinner Sun-Wed) Kobe Club: Dinner only (RW menu offered daily through March 31st -- can you guess whose restaurant it is?)

We just received an email from Patina Restaurant Group (Brasserie, Brasserie 8 1/2, Nick & Stef's, Cafe Centro, Naples 45, The Sea Grill, etc) in response to our complaint from earlier that the dessert course makes Restaurant Week deals less sweet. Here it is: Just read your piece about the problems with Restaurant Week and agree. I’m happy to tell you that the Patina Restaurant Group understands the concern diners like yourself have as it relates to the cost of a drink during this rough economy. So, in addition to the participation of most of their restaurants in Restaurant Week, they’ve gone ahead and provided a boost to those wishing to wine and dine with two promotions. The first promotion is featured at Cucina & Co. (MetLife Building) and consists of a three course dinner (app, entrée and dessert) AND a glass of wine for $19.50…besting all current Restaurant Week options. I’ve attached a flier for it. The second special program is featured at most of the Patina Restaurant Group restaurants in NYC, LA and NJ. I’ve included the press announcement below but to summarize – it’s called “Wines for the Wise” and all bottles of wine (red, white, bubbly or otherwise) are now 25% off through March 31. Again, please see press release for full details. I hope that you’ll let your readers know that someone out there understands and is making good on your request. Click here to see where you can get 25% off bottles of wine and find more details on the Cucina & Co. special, after the jump...

Trying to Help You Get the Most Out Of 'Restaurant Week'

The 2-weeks of 'Winter Restaurant Week' kick off this Sunday, the 18th. Top restaurants all over the city will be serving up 3-course lunches and dinners for $24.07 and $35, respectively. In the past, the deal was only good on weekedays and some of the top-tier restaurants refused to participate, but this year, thanks to the economy, NYC Restaurant Week has been expanded to include Sunday's and the list of participating restaurants has ballooned to more than 250, the largest group in its 18-year history. A few restaurants are even offering the deal on Saturday. Many restaurants have already been in 'Restaurant Week' mode for several weeks now, offering attractive 'Recession Specials' to lure diners in this ever-souring economy. With the sad news from Steven Hanson's BR Guest empire yesterday of several restaurant closings and these ominous predictions former Chef Fabio Trabocchi of Fiamma relayed to Frank Bruni during a phone call, there is no doubt that restaurants are stepping up their efforts in a major way, as Steven Hanson puts it, \"to hug the customer.\" Find out our biggest Restaurant Week gripe, and our proposed solution, after the jump... While Restaurant Week certainly provides a great opportunity to affordably dine at some of the city's most expensive restaurants, our single biggest problem with Restaurant Week is that we are not dessert eaters. We maybe order dessert with dinner once or twice a year...Birthdays, so we can stick a candle in something, and Valentine's Day. In fact, nobody that we know who dines frequently in the city orders desserts...especially in January when they are trying to stay true to New Year's resolutions. When you factor out dessert and factor in a glass or two of wine and/or cocktails, a Restaurant Week meal can become an expensive outing. Hanson said in his interview that the solution is to cater to diners. We are ready to be catered to and \"hugged.\" Here's our thoughts: Beginning today we are reaching out to participating restaurants to see if any of them are ready to step it up in a MAJOR WAY. What we are asking is this: give diners a choice -- a desssert course OR a glass of house wine (not asking for a 2005 first-growth Bordeaux, but something towards the bottom of the wine list). If that's too much to ask, then restaurants can get creative with this and perhaps do a buy 1 glass, get 1 glass option in lieu of dessert. From our experience (and market research), people will order an additional glass of wine or cocktail when they receive one for free. Guess who we're reaching out to first? We'll let you know the responses we get. Wish us luck.

I don't think you can beat GT's deals -- $24.07 gift certificate and bottles of wine for $24.07 at lunch -- problem is they only are offering Restaurant Week menu for lunch and only Mon-Fri....also GT books up the first day they take reservations for Restaurant Week...though i hear it's first come-first serve in the front part of the restaurant. Have to be either a tourist or homemaker to take advantage of this one. unfortunately, i'm usually at my desk during lunch.

No, we haven't been to any of the Smorgas Chef's in the city...but we seem to come across these Scandinavian-themed restaurants wherever we go. There's one near us in Midtown, another one in the heart of the W. Village, one in the FiDi on Stone Street and another on Park Avenue b/t 37th and 38th. There's no better time than now to try it out. We just found this special on the Village Voice website: Dear Voice Reader, We are celebrating the opening of our 4th restaurant on Park Avenue by offering our guests a free bottle of wine at any of our 4 places. Enjoy! HERE'S HOW: Write to villagewine@smorgas.com to receive your printable wine gift card.

We got a bit nervous yesterday when we read on Grub Street that \"Kuma Inn got a thumbs-up for a new license (good-bye, BYO!)\" and on Eater that Kuma Inn got approved \"for a new license separate from the one they've apparently been sharing with a restaurant downstairs.\" We reached out to Kuma Inn earlier today to get the scoop on whether its BYO is now DOA. We received this email from Kuma Inn a little while ago: From: Kuma Inn Subject: Kuma Inn BYO Thank you for your interest in Kuma Inn. Kuma Inn is currently still BYO. We are in the process of applying for a beer/wine restaurant license.

If you missed all the hot spots booking up two months in advance, Wednesday is your day to take advantage of the restaurants that take reservations one month in advance of Valentine's Day. Think Bouley, Little Owl, Babbo, The House... and get ready for some serious speed dialing and busy signals. Good Luck! p.s. if I didn't already have reservations, I'd be jumping on this open 9pm reservation at La Sirene, a quaint French bistro BYO in Soho that's offering a 4-course prix-fixe for $69.

By George! City Crab & Seafood Co. Has a Huge Heart...and a Recession Special
***AUTHOR
Andy
***DATE

***CONTENT
In what is perhaps the feel-good story of early 2009, City Crab on Park Avenue agreed this past Friday to release back to the sea an approximately 140 year-old 20 lb. lobster named \"George.\" City Crab had purchased the lobster that was caught off the coast of Canada a couple weeks ago for about $100. We first heard about City Crab's tremendous gesture early Saturday morning and decided to head over there on Sunday to see if we could get some more info on this story that has been receiving national and international attention. According to a manager, Tom, who sat down to speak with us, calls have been flooding in from all over the world to show appreciation for the restaurant's compassion. \"We had no idea the reaction we would get from releasing George, but it just seemed like the right thing to do,\" said the manager. \"We have been receiving calls from people in Italy, Canada and New Zealand to thank us and an 8-year-old girl even called up yesterday crying and pleading for us not to release George into waters 'where he's just going to get caught again.'\" Apparently no one had told the young girl that PETA drove George up to Kennebunkport, Maine and released the 20 lb lobster in protected waters less than a mile from former President George H.W. Bush's summer home. More on this story and if you can still bring yourself to eating a lobster, a big Recession Special offer for Wined & Dined readers, after the jump... In a blog post on the PETA website, PETA writes that the next step is to \"ban catching lobsters completely.\" We asked Tom if he feels the decision to release the lobster could set a dangerous precedent for City Crab and other restaurants as far as PETA is concerned. He said he doesn't think so and responded that the vast majority of lobsters City Crab sells are in the 2-2.5 lb. range with a few reaching as big as 4-5 lbs. This gives you an idea of just how big \"George\" is and how unusual it is for a restaurant to get its hands on a 20 lb. lobster. He thinks, if anything, this will lead to some restaurants \"scaling down the size of the lobsters they buy and sell.\" We then asked Tom how City Crab has been faring in these tough economic times. He said they are feeling the effects of the recession like most big Manhattan restaurants. Many of the big companies and firms around the city that typically hold their holiday parties at City Crab bowed out of their holiday party reservations at the end of last year. In terms of special offers to lure diners, Tom said that City Crab is currently running a promotion for 15% off your meal. The catch is you have to have already dined at City Lobster and filled out a promotion card with your email address and other info. As if releasing George hasn't already built enough goodwill and PR for the restaurant, City Crab told us they will honor the 15% off deal on-the-spot for customers (without having to wait until a return visit) that mention they heard about it AND if you order a lobster that is 2 lbs. or bigger, City Crab will give you 1.25 lbs. of lobster for free. And for all you PETA fanatics out there, all we can offer you is this. SHARETHIS.addEntry({ title: \"By George! City Crab & Seafood Co.

Recession Special en francais? Picholine Set to Expand its Menu d'Economie

Doesn't everything sound better in French? Bien sur! We got word today that due to increasing popularity, Picholine will be expanding its Menu d'Economie, aka its 'Value Dining Experience', otherwise known as a 'Recession Special', that was originally launched in early December. Until now, the Menu d'Economie has been available each evening at the Cheese and Wine Bar, but only in the Dining Room when tables are available. Picholine will be announcing in the coming days that the Menu d'Economie will be offered in the Dining Room by reservation Monday through Thursday after 9 pm. It will also remain available in the Cheese and Wine Bar each night all night long. It really is one of the better Recession Specials we've come across. It's also the best name we've seen for a Recession Special menu. Sophisticated, yet approachable. The Menu d'Economie continues to feature a wide array of “tasting plates” (12 different half-portion entrées for $20), “tasting flights” (choose 3 from a selection of 15 dishes for $20), and 60 wines for under $60 a bottle. Picholine emphasized that these under $60 bottles include wines from producers such as \"Chateau Beaucastel, Etienne Sauzet, and Chateau Rayas.\" Picholine is one of just seven NYC restaurants to be awarded 2-stars in the 2009 Michelin Guide and is a 26 (food), 24 (decor), 25 (service) on Zagat. We'll be checking out this special for ourselves soon and will let you know what we think. To Chef Brennan, we say merci beaucoup! SHARETHIS.addEntry({ title: \"Recession Special en francais?

With people celebrating far fewer business deals and expense accounts freezing up, perhaps nobody's feelin' the pain these days more than the high-end steak houses around the city. Here are some steak house recession specials we have recently happened upon: Center Cut @ The Empire Hotel is offering a special $39 menu available every day between 5-7pm and again after 10pm. You get a soup + salad in one course and an entree + side in a second course. They send you home with some fresh cookies for dessert. Heard from co-worker that it is an excellent deal. Morton's is offering a Dinner for 2 Special for $109. You get 2 single cut filets, a choice of 2 seafood appetizers, a potato and vegetable to share and a choice of 2 desserts. They are also offering one bottle of red and one bottle of white each night for $39. A few more steak house deals, including one with ALL-YOU-CAN-DRINK WINE and one DOUBLE RECESSION SPECIAL after the jump... Maloney & Porcelli is offering what it calls \"The Weekend Wine Dinner\" on Friday and Saturday nights after 8pm and on Sundays after 5pm. $75 per person gets you any appetizer, entree and dessert with unlimited pours of your choice of 4 featured wines! Zagat claims the waiters \"don't flinch\" in pouring the non-stop wine. Nick + Stef's is offering a Special Wine Dinner Prix Fixe. Every night after 8pm, for $45 you get an appetizer, entree and dessert + you get a complimentary glass of wine with both the appetizer and entree courses. Make this a Double Recession Special by using the 20% off discount (off the entire bill) offered by The Dish by AMEX promotion. Click here for more details. Click here to see why we think The Dish is a legit deal. Let's just say with tax + tip the meal comes out to $60 per person. Your AMEX bill will show a charge of $48, meaning the deal basically pays your tax + tip. Ruth's Chris is offering a Steak + Stuffed Lobster special for $39.95.

I started to write this before even finishing my Black Label Burger that I had delivered to me at my office from City Burger (for 10% off I should add). I think I may have two bites left (if i take really small bites) and I'm procrastinating cause I don't want to see it go. I didn't even get it fresh (it traveled a good ways in some inclement weather to find me) and I think I can say it was one of the best burgers I've had in a while, i.e. since Molly's. Man was I ready to bash it, denounce all the hypers out there and proudly proclaim Burger Joint as my defending favorite burger in Midtown...but I cannot. This burger epitomizes 'quality not quantity.' It's not gonna win any awards for it's brawn, but it's the juiciest, most flavorful burger I've had in a while. Not to mention, it was perhaps the pinkest, most perfectly prepared medium rare I've ever had. I'm glad to finally understand what the La Frieda mix hype is all about. Time for those two small bites. Go getcha some. Couple of more pics after the jump...

Value Brunches at B.R. Guest Restaurants?

Well, you know how much Andy and I love the all-you-can-drink brunch, but not every weekend day is fit for such an early all-out party. So, where do you go if you still want a great brunch at a good value? You would normally not expect a B.R. Guest Restaurant to be the answer, but with 9 NYC restaurants (Atlantic Grill, Ocean Grill, Isabella's, Blue Water Grill, Blue Fin, Primehouse NY, Dos Caminos Park, Soho, and 3rd Ave) offering reasonably priced brunch dishes that all come with a complimentary brunch cocktail, you really can find an amazing and high quality value brunch. Find out how the two of us enjoy a delicious brunch with frozen prickly pear margaritas for under $30 bucks, after the jump... So, the brunch menus do still have some pricey items, but if you stick with the basics as if you were in your neighborhood diner or favorite breakfast place, you can really get away with a deal in one of these spots- AND with much better service and a nicer ambiance. Yes, you don't have the cozy, country atmosphere you may enjoy at some of our other brunch faves, but you will certainly get great food and a quality cocktail. Andy and I head to our local Dos Caminos on 3rd Ave. often in the warmer months to enjoy brunch in the sun on their large outdoor patio. I order the wild mushroom and huitlachoche omelette (goat cheese, epazote and salsa verde) that comes with a generous portion of spicy home fries for $13 (AND a Frozen Prickly Pear margarita on the house that normally sells for $11). Andy changes it up every now and then, but he tends to like the Dos Caminos Chicken Cobb Salad (grilled chicken breast, tomato, avocado, chorizo, grilled corn, onion, and queso fresco cilantro-basil vinaigrette) for $15 (AND a spicy bloody mary on the house- cocktails normally run around $12). So we end up with a $28 brunch + tax and tip. For comparison, if we were to head to our our local Moonstruck diner, the greek omelette I normally order with added mushrooms would cost me $10.50 (and it would not be nearly as fluffy or use the same fresh ingredients as Dos does). Andy's Cobb salad would be $12.25 (and an extra $1.50 if he wanted it chopped). Total diner brunch= $22.75 + tax + tip. You may be saving $5 and change, but you've lost your fresh market ingredients, better service, nicer atmosphere, and (most importantly) your delicious brunch cocktails! Think about Isabella's Farmer's Market Egg White Omelette with turkey bacon, market vegetables, and tomato salsa with a glass of cold, crisp champagne for $12.50 the next time you pay $2 for every extra ingredient and $2 more for egg whites while ordering the greasy omelette from your local diner. Think real value. Check out the brunch menus: - Atlantic Grill - Blue Fin - Blue Water Grill - Dos Caminos Park Ave. - Dos Caminos 3rd Ave. - Dos Caminos Soho - Isabella's (Sunday Brunch) - Ocean Grill - Primehouse New York SHARETHIS.addEntry({ title: \"Value Brunches at B.R.

Hey guys, can we get on your dinner calendar sometime....? I'm in the city during the week and in Philly most weekends. But Jeff comes up on occasional weekends. Hope you had an awesome New Year's!! I haven't looked at your blog in a little while, and I'm so impressed at all the places you've been and how consistently dedicated you are to reviewing them!! I'll be entertained for weeks while I catch up!

Jill

Wildwood and Vento are both br guest but it doesn't look like they have a complimentary cocktail with their brunch entrees. Ruby Foos uptown and times square are also br guest but they only do lunch- no brunch.

I haven't been in quite a while, but they definitely didn't offer the free drink last time I was there (but we're talking years). It's thankfully on the menu now.

City Burger Delivery! A Recession Special?

 It looks like my New Year's resolution didn't even last a week. After reading all the hooplah over the past month about City Burger's famed Pat La Frieda Black Label burger, including this rave review by A Hamburger Today, I decided to break down today and give it a shot. I was a bit reluctant to do so after caving and trying the overhyped Irving Mill pork fatback burger, which I found to be completely underwhelming. Now Broadway @ 39th St isn't exactly the most convenient of locations for Midtowners, especially in this weather. So, I checked out City Burger's website and what do you know, THEY DELIVER! I put in my information and discovered that everything on the menu is 10% off. Actually, just got a call and it's here...gotta run, will let you know what I thought soon!

Recession Specials Disguised as Anniversary Specials?

***CONTENT
By now it's no secret that restaurants all over the city are luring diners to the table by offering up \"recession special\" prix-fixe menus. With the recession predicted to last through 2010, you can rest assured that more and more restaurants will be following suit. However, many big-name restaurateurs with fine-dining destinations loathe the idea of offering such specials fearing it sends a message of desperation. They oppose discounting for fear that consumers will undervalue the level of food and service provided. There's also always the concern on the diner's part that the food or service will suffer if the prices are lowered, aka the 'Restaurant Week Effect.' So in these tough times 'big ego' restaurants (you know, the ones that would rather tell you that they do not have a table for 2 at 8pm on a Friday night than appear to be struggling) must walk a fine line in strategizing to keep their tables filled, but without losing their swagger in the process. Jean-Georges put aside his hubris in becoming the first of the big name restaurateurs to offer up $24 lunch and $35 dinner recession specials at his NYC restaurants. I think in doing so he is building customer loyalty and good-will. When this economy turns around, I for one will be patroniozing the restaurants that showed compassion and generosity during the tough times. Learn a new strategy being employed by some of the city's top dining destinations after the jump... We have come upon what appears to be a new strategy employed by some restaurateurs who want to lure diners without sounding desperate for business: disguise the Recession Special as an Anniversary Special. Take the famed and highly-acclaimed Four Seasons Restaurant for instance. To celebrate 1959, the year the Four Seasons opened its doors, the restaurant is offering a $59 three-course prix-fixe menu throughout 2009 for lunch and dinner in the Pool Room, featuring lobster and black truffle risotto, shrimp and their famous farmhouse duck. We just learned yesterday that Restaurant Daniel is offering from now through March 2009 a 15th Anniversary Celebration Menu. This $98 three-course prix-fixe menu comes with wine pairings. The only catch is that it is only offered Monday through Thursday from 5:30-6:30pm. These sound like recession specials in anniversary menu clothing to me. Typically, restaurants only offer aniversary menus on a one-night or one weekend basis, while these are being offered over a course of months. And c'mon, who's really doing any celebrating these days?

Restaurant Daniel Announces First Ever Beer-Pairing Dinners: Is Beer the New Wine for '09?

***CONTENT
In a time when we are all facing the harsh realities of a declining global economy, one of the big food and wine trends for 2009 predicted by thefoodpeople, a British-based food trend consultancy, is a shift in drinking habits with more in-home drinking as well as a rise in the popularity of beer, cider and cocktails. Flavor & The Menu magazine, a publication specializing in trends and forecasts in the food industry, predicted that the top culinary trend of 2009 would be \"Tapping Beer's Potential,\" writing \"now that beer is the new wine, thanks to a flood of new craft beer products and imports, chefs are creating menus that match beer lists in their complexity and casual-yet-sophisticated approcah to pub food.\" Also, just this past Friday, Eric Asimov of the NYTimes ran a story on a $35 barrel-aged bottle of beer called Abbaye de Saint Bon-Chien. He says that many luxury beers like this one go well with foods ranging from seafood and cheeses to chocolate. In what may be a sign of the times, or just sheer coincidence, Daniel Boulud's NYC flagship restaurant Daniel just announced its first ever beer-pairing dinners set for January 27 and 28th. The email says that these luxury beer dinners are in anticipation of the Spring '09 opening of DBGB, Boulud's more casual and hip 'brasserie meets luxe diner' in the Avalon Bowery Place apartment building. People had speculated that DBGB would be a burger place akin to BLT Burger. Boulud dispelled those rumors in this NYPost interview back in September. Find out more on the beer-pairing dinners and other food and drink trends for 2009 after the jump... The beer tastings at Restaurant Daniel will feature Kasteel Cru's Alsatian lager in addition to signature cocktails made with beer. The dinner opens with these beer-infused cocktails followed by a four-course dinner paired with luxury beers. The dinners are hosted by Samuel Merritt, President of the so-called 'Civilization of Beer,' and go for $135 per person (not including tip or gratuity). Oh yeah, in case you were wondering what some of the other predicted food trends are for 2009, click here and here.

New Year's Resolution #1 = Eat Healthy. So, why are we writing about donuts you ask? Because we recently discovered Holey Donuts - low fat, low calorie, amazingly delicious donuts. You can indulge (without really indulging) in a coconut cream pie, raspberry graham cracker, banana cream pie, or fudge crumb boston cream donut for 150-250 calories and 3-4 grams of fat! The average \"regular\" donut has 15-20 grams of fat and as much as 480 calories. Not only are they low fat/low calorie, they are truly delicious and there are tons of amazing flavors. Perfect solution to any craving for sweets and perfect way to keep new year's resolution #1 without sacrificing any taste! And they are selling their gourmet donuts today on QVC @ 1 p.m. If you are too busy watching football, check out their website where you can order online. Trust us... they're worth it.

Boozy Brunch: Roberto Passon

***CONTENT
There is no better deal than an all you can drink brunch in NYC and there is no better deal for an all you can drink brunch than Roberto Passon in Hells Kitchen (741 Ninth Avenue at 50th Street). With no brunch items over $12 and with unlimited brunch cocktails (champagne, mimosas, screwdrivers, bloody marys, or strawberry/kiwi/peach bellinis) at $8 per person, it has to be one of if not the best brunch deal in NYC. Thanks to Wined & Dined commenter Dan for recommending it to us. More on our AYCD brunch at Roberto Passon and a new boozy brunch restaurant group discovery after the jump... First of all, unlike some boozy brunch destinations, Roberto Passon lets you switch between cocktails so you can try them all out if you would like. Second of all, unlike some Italian restaurants that do brunch, Roberto Passon had an extensive selection of traditional brunch items. You can select from breakfast items such as french toast, pancakes, eggs benedict and omelets, in addition to the expected paninis, salads, pastas, and meat and fish choices. And the prices are ridiculous- the most expensive item being the grilled salmon with spinach at $12 (seriously). Andy had the fusilli with chicken, tomato and bacon for $9 and it was delicious. It was flavorful, spicy, creamy, and the fusilli was perfectly al dente. I was in the mood for something relatively light so I had the Caesar salad with grilled shrimp for $9. The salad was crisp and the Caesar dressing authentic. I also found the grilled shrimp to be seasoned well. It went very well with the massive glasses of bubbly that were poured generously and refilled constantly. Once my first large wine glass of champagne was poured, I was instantly reminded of Il Bastardo, another favorite all you can drink brunch spot in Chelsea. I checked out the Roberto Passon website and I learned that Roberto Passon is owned by the New York City Restaurant Group (NYCRG). The NYCRG owns three (now four) all you can drink brunch spots that I've been to countless times- Nero in Meatpacking, Il Bastardo in Chelsea, and Arte Cafe on the UWS. They also own Bar Baresco, Bocca Bacco, Gallo Nero, Zucchero e Pomodori, Cara Mia, Intermezzo, Maria Pia, film center cafe, Scarlatto, and Puttanesca. Their aim is to \"provide delicious food at inexpensive prices\" and boy do they succeed at boozy brunches. Cheers to NYCRG- keep up the great work!

Good call- $16 for a brunch item served with home fries, salad, and bottomless mimosas or bloody marys is quite a recession special. Can you get the steak & eggs or burger with that deal? It looks like we'll be heading to Regate at 198 Orchard! They also advertise 25% off alcohol/liquor on Wednesdays....

Beer With Benefits?

While most college students spend their free time drinking beer, a group of students at Rice University are experimenting with it. They're using genetic engineering to create beer, aptly named \"BioBeer,\" that contains resveratrol, a chemical in red wine that's been shown to reduce cancer and heart disease in lab animals. Resveratrol, found in the skin of red grapes, has been linked with the so-called 'French Paradox', a phrase used to describe the low incidence of heart disease and obesity among the French, despite their relatively high-fat diet and levels of wine consumption. More on BioBeer and even more reason to drink IPAs after the jump...To create their BioBeer, the students are attempting to genetically alter a strain of yeast so that it produces resveratrol while also fermenting beer. Ironically, most of the team's undergrad members aren't even old enough to legally drink beer. The team at Rice is currently working with Texas-based Saint Arnold Brewing Company to synthesize the antioxidant from the amino acid tyrosine. They do not expect the resveratrol to affect the taste of the beer since the chemical is tasteless and odorless. Resveratrol is already found in low levels in hops, the raw ingredient of beer. So while we wait for BioBeer to hit the shelves, we recommend drinking IPAs, the hoppiest of beers, to get your resveratrol. Here are some of our faves: Bear Republic Racer 5, Stone Ruination, Southern Tier Unearthly, Lagunitas Maximus, Dogfish Head 90 Minute, Green Flash West Coast and Great Divide Hercules.

The wonder ingredient in wine is indeed resveratrol. Dr. David Sinclair, Associate Professor of Pathology and Co-Director of the Laboratories for the Biological Mechanisms of Aging at Harvard Medical School is the leader in research into the anti-aging properties of resveratrol. The current studies performed by Dr. Sinclair and many other researchers have shown great promise for resveratrol treating the diseases of aging. There are numerous articles that I have linked to at my website - http://resveratrol.webiage.com - that document the findings for the potential health benefits in treating heart disease, cancer, diabetes, osteoporosis, obesity, and other diseases.

Wines Til Sold Out: Our Favorite (and Cheapest) Way to Buy Wine

***CONTENT
Here's our gift to you this holiday season. I first discovered WinesTilSoldOut.com (WTSO) last year in a small advertisement in the back of an issue of New York Magazine. I decided to go online and see what it was all about. Since then, we've purchased no less than 100 bottles of wine through this site at unbelievable prices (and with free shipping). The wines WTSO sells run the gamut from $5.99 bottles of Prosecco to the most expensive Bordeaux and Burgandy out there. I bought a bottle of 1995 Château Latour in a WTSO marathon (will explain below what a 'marathon' is) for $250, which now sells for $1,100 a bottle at Sherry-Lehmann in NYC. On the opposite end, Jill ordered us 4 bottles of Cava just last week at $9.99 a bottle. Here's how it works: WTSO sells one type of wine per day until it is sold out or until 11:59pm eastern standard time, when it is replaced. If that bottle sells out early, WTSO will then add another wine (but no more than 3 wines per day). WTSO ships to 32 states. Click here to see if they ship to you. When you sign up (free) you get an email each morning with the wine of the day, including the description of the wine, available ratings and price, and a comparison of the lowest price on the web for the same bottle. If it's nothing of interest to you, simply delete the email and wait for the next one. If an offering piques your interest, I suggest jumping on it, since the best deals tend to sell out quite quickly. The 40 or so people I have told about the site are mostly WTSO regulars now and the great deals are selling out faster as the customer base grows. Find out some insane deals we've taken advantage of and what a WTSO marathon is, after the jump... I was looking back at some of my old receipts from WTSO this morning, and these stuck out as ridic deals: 3 bottles of Casanova di Neri Brunello di Montalcino Tenuta Nuova 2000 for $33.99/bottle -- currently retails for anywhere b/t $50-80. Oh yeah, and the 2001 vintage was Wine Spectator's Wine of the Year for 2006. 3 bottles of Le Vieux Donjon Chateauneuf du Pape Blanc 2004 for $29.99/bottle - currently retails for $45.99/bottle at Sherry-Lehmann 6 bottles of Caliterra Cabernet Sauvignon Reserva 2005 for $7.99/bottle - currently retails for anywhere b/t $11-13. This is a great Chilean value wine. JUST TODAY WE PURCHASED 2 BOTTLES OF DOMAINE HUMBERT FRERES GEVREY-CHEVERTIN 2005 BURGANDY FOR $39.99/bottle -- currently retails for anywhere b/t $55-75. Over the past week, WTSO has been offering one of our favorite wine producers, Mollydooker, at great price-points. Also, be sure on the lookout for WTSO Marathons -- days when WTSO sells a variety of wines (24-80 different wines, depending on the type of marathon) from midnight to midnight. You receive an email notice of the marathon about a week before it runs with a short description of the products being featured. You also receive an email at the start of the marathon.

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas... well, okay, it has been looking like Christmas for a while here in NYC, but we've just put together a list of our 5 favorite festive spots if you are looking for some extra NYC holiday cheer. Beware, if you hit up too many of these classics, you may just break out into uncontrollable carolling. Enjoy! 1. Rolf's French Bavarian Brasserie: It does not get more festive than this German (now French Bavarian) eatery located in Gramercy on 21st and 3rd Ave. Picture yourself dining or drinking inside a giant Christmas tree. They were nevery really known for their food, but with a new chef (Adalbert Rasemborg) it may be worth a try. Find four more festive faves after the jump... 2. Waterfront Ale House: I know you must be wondering how Waterfront Ale managed to get on this list, but we have to include the birth place of our favorite egg nog ever! Head to 30th and 2nd Ave for Sam's Serious Egg Nog (made with 3 rums + bourbon)- it is by far the most serious egg nog in town AND you can share this holiday treat, because they serve this magic by the bottle. Also be sure to try the Anchor Christmas on-tap. Here's the full beer list from BeerMenus. Bottoms up... 3. Pulse at Rockefeller Center: Now, there is nothing more festive that checking out the tree and skating rink at Rockefeller Center, but who wants to spend exorbitant amounts of money on mediocre food at the tourist trap restaurants surrounding all that holiday goodness? New York Magazine's Holiday Guide recommends the \"semi-secret restaurant at Sports Club/LA\" for a \"bird's eye view of the tree and an Asian accented menu.\" If you gotta do it, check it out at 45 Rockefeller Plaza and 50th Street. 4. Zum Schneider: People have a tendency to break out in Christmas song at one of our favorite Biergartens on Avenue C and 7th Street. Maybe that's because they host a carolling every year, with song book and back up music (Check It Out Here). Even if you miss the official carolling, Zum Schneider is a fun festive place to knock back some serious steins of German brews and to perform your own drunken rendition of Rudolf the Red Nose Reindeer. 5. Celsius @ Bryant Park: In case you haven't noticed, there is a giant glass-enclosed two-story, 7,000 foot structure sitting beside the ice-skating rink at Bryant Park, including a huge balcony with outdoor heat lamps. The Buddha Bar team has crafted a \"Canadian-themed\" comfort food menu replete with menu items such as chili, mac n' cheese, sliders, \"chilly\" dogs, fish and chips and more. What holiday would be complete without a lawsuit? Apparently, Bryant Park Grill was none too pleased with the added competition for customers in this economy (here's more on the \"food fight\" that erupted in Bryant Park). Don't worry...Wined & Dined is staying out of this one.

Matsugen: Really a Recession \"Gift\" from Jean-Georges?

As previously reported on Wined & Dined, Jean-Georges Vongerichten described his \"Gift to You This Season\" as his $24 prix-fixe lunches and his $35 prix-fixe dinners at most of his NYC restaurants. He called the \"best deal, by far\" the 6 course mini-omakase dinner at Matsugen in TriBeCa, described by Zagat as a \"Japanese soba house gone 'upscale.'\" So, in the middle of a winter storm with snow falling heavily, Andy and I were off to Church and Leonard Street to receive our gift. See what we thought of Jean-Georges' heartfelt recession special after the jump... The $35 Menu: Wasabi Nuts - Grilled Edamame - Madai Usuzukuri with Soy Wasabi - Black Cod with Miso OR 4 Pieces of Sushi - Chicken Meatballs - Kamoseiro Duck Soup with Soba Noodles - Vanilla Caramel Pudding (Plus Homemade Soft Tofu that we ordered a la carte for $8). The Verdict: Overall we were very happy with our gift from Jean-Georges. It is quite a deal after all and we also found a reasonably priced bottle of Gewurtz that we thoroughly enjoyed. Pretty amazing any time you can get out of a JG restaurant under $150 (including tip) for dinner for 2 and a bottle of wine. It was definitely a small bite tasting menu and the courses did not come separately. We received our wasabi nuts, grilled edamame, and madai usuzukuri while we were still enjoying our fresh soft tofu (excellent, by the way). Andy's 4 pieces of sushi came at the same time as his chicken meatballs and my black cod with miso arrived after all my little chicken meatballs were gone. We could not believe we were finished with a full 6 courses (7 if you add in our tofu) in about an hour! AND Andy was still hungry for more after our last course. Despite a quick moving and haphazard serving style, we really did enjoy the food and for $35 it is a steal. I include a list of our favorites below. Thanks Jean-Georges and if you're still feeling generous, we're ready for some more presents! Favorites: - The Madai Usuzukuri with Soy Wasabi (sashimi style red snapper) - Chicken Meatballs (delicious and not what I was expecting at all- they burst with flavor) - Kamoseiro Duck Soup with Soba Noodles (and we received a little lesson on how to dip our cold soba noodles in the steaming tasty duck broth- very tasty...it was also a nice surprise when the broth in which the noodles cooked was added at the end of the meal to our remaining duck broth so we did not miss out on any of the soba nutrients) Tip: I would recommend the Miso Cod over the traditional 4 pieces of sushi. Andy couldn't help his wandering chopsticks from crossing the table for my cod.

North Fork Nirvana: Our Weekend In Long Island Wine Country

***CONTENT
This time of year is wining and dining season for us. Andy's parents were in the city this Thanksgiving for 10 (gluttonous) days and were excited to try out some of our favorite spots around town. Among many others, we hit up Kuma Inn, Buddakan, Stage Deli, and Mia Dona. But even with all these great meals, we were most excited for our weekend in Long Island's North Fork wine region. We had planned the perfect winter weekend getaway -- a stay at The North Fork Table & Inn (and dinner there Saturday night), a dinner at The Frisky Oyster in Greenport, and of course visits and tastings at several of the North Fork's 53 wineries and vineyards. Highlights from our fantastic NOFO weekend after the jump... Andy and I think that the North Fork of Long Island is the perfect weekend getaway from NYC. It has everything- the beach, the wineries, the marinas, the great local restaurants, and it still has the rustic, country feel (that the Hamptons is certainly missing)- so we were excited to share our favorite weekend away destination with Andy's parents, Donna and Charles, my Mom, Barbara, and Jacquie and Gary. Day 1, Friday: We left the city early to avoid all the weekend traffic and were in the NOFO in a couple of quick hours. First stop on our gourmet tour of the North Fork was Love Lane Kitchenin Mattituck. Lunch was excellent. I had the butternut squash soup and then Donna and I split a lobster roll and grilled vegggie and goat cheese panini. Andy and Charles split a grilled swordfish sandwich and an amazing-looking french dip. We also shared an order of sweet potato fries and garlic and rosemary fries for the table and washed it all down with some Circus Boy drafts. Delicious! Next it was time to explore the area a bit before checking in to The North Fork Table & Inn. We drove around Southold, Greenport, and Orient and watched the sun set over the water. Once it got dark, it was time to check into the Inn and pop open some wine. We had all four of The North Fork Table & Inn's rooms reserved, and it was great to have the whole place to ourselves. When we arrived, we walked right into the restaurant as the chef was going over the menu with all the staff and they were tasting all the evening's specials. It looked great, but we would have to wait for our NFT&I feast until Saturday night. My Mom, Jacquie, and Gary arrived and we all caught up in one of the rooms over a couple of glasses of wine (the only problem with the NFT&I is that there is no Inn common area- the living room is actually the restaurant!). Then we were off to Greenport for dinner at the Frisky Oyster. We arrived a 1/2 hour early to the restaurant, but we were able to snag a big lounge table in the front of the restaurant by the bar. We ordered some local bottles of red and white (including a Shinn Estate “First Fruit” White 2007 that we all agreed exemplifies the great 2007 growing season in Long Island) and and were seated in no time. Dinner was superb. The oysters \"friskafella\" were amazing- by far my favorite starter. Fresh oysters with spinach, parmesan, garlic, and chipotle... mmmmm.... The steamed P.E.I. mussels with chardonnay cream were also excellent. For my entree, I was very pleased with the crescent duck breast with \"hash\" of baby fennel, shiitake, and duck leg confit, although I do have to admit that Andy won with his braised short ribs. We got to meet sommelier, Eileen Duffy, who recommended a 2005 Paumanok Cabernet Franc (Donna's favorite of the weekend), and we also decided to go with another bottle of the Shinn Estate White. After some great food, great local wine, we decided to hit up the local bar across the street. We enjoyed a few games of pool, a couple rounds of darts, and some ice cold brews before we retired to the Inn. Day 2, Saturday: Can it get any better than waking up on a sunny crisp winter day and coming downstairs to the dining room to be greeted by Claudia Fleming (formerly of Gramercy Tavern and the winner of the James Beard Pastry Chef of the Year) with a piping hot dish of gruyere, vegetable, and bacon frittata? Nope, it cannot. The freshly baked assorted scones and muffins, the homemade granola, the fresh fruit, and the local goat's milk yogurt were all lovely additions to the morning spread. We all feasted on breakfast, sipped on our freshly squeezed juices and coffee, purused the morning paper, and then we were off to start our day of wine tasting. After another leisurely drive along the water and some house hunting adventures, we were ready for our first winery. Stop 1: Bedell Cellers in Cutchogue, New York. Andy and I loved coming to Bedell in the warmer months to enjoy their beautiful deck and outdoor tasting bar while listening to live music and making new friends. At this time of the year, it was certainly too chilly for the outdoor tasting bar, but we still enjoyed the modern tasting room that was renovated in 2001 and that looks more like a gallery than a winery. We did leave with a couple of bottles of wine, but Bedell is certainly on the more pricey side of NOFO wine, so we decided to save our case purchases for later in the day. Stop 2: Croteaux Vineyards in Southold, New York. Croteaux was truly a delight! I had never been to this winery before, and boy was I in for a treat. The tasting room is tiny and overwhelmingly charming. There was barely enough room for us all to sit around the bar and start tasting. Croteaux makes only rosés and I LOVE nothing more than a great rosé on a summer day (or in this case a freezing winter day). They make their rosés in the same style as those made in the South of France and all have a nice dry balance of fruit and acidity. All three rosés that we tasted were made from 100% merlot and my favorite (that I took home a few bottles of) was the 2007 Croteaux Merlot 181 Rosé- very light and delicate. I envisioned myself overlooking the beaches of Nice or Cannes with a glass of this in hand. The 2007 Croteaux Merlot 314 Rosé and the 2007 Croteaux Merlot 3 Rosé were also lovely and Donna, Charles, Jacquie, Gary, and Barbara all took home cases or bottles of all three. Paula Croteau, who owns Croteaux Vineyard with her husband, was so friendly and knowledgeable as she lead us through our tasting. She also told us all about her cooking school and offered us some delicious homemade white chocolate almond bark along with our wines. They also discount the cost of the tasting to the purchase of any wine, so we tasted for free and she was happy to pour seconds and thirds as we decided on our favorites. Stop 3: Shinn Estate Vineyards in Mattituch, New York. Andy and I have stayed at the Shinn Estate Farmhouse, the four bedroom inn on the vineyard property. Unfortunately, it was not available for our weekend away this time, but we would definitely recommend it. We were able, though, to make it to the Shinn Estate Vineyard for a great wine tasting. We sat in the tasting room in their renovated barn at a big table and began tasting away. We really enjoy these wines and took home a mixed case of red and whites. We coincidentally had a couple bottles of the 2007 \"First Fruit\" Sauvignon Blanc Semillon the night before at the Frisky Oyster and we LOVE the \"Wild Boar Doe\" (I mean come on- how cute). Andy was also big fan of the 2005 Nine Barrel Reserve Merlot and the Cabernet Sauvignon recently reviewed by the Wine Spectator. Next Stop: Greenport. We got a little hungry and decided to head to Greenport for a little shopping and some snacks. We stopped in for some sandwiches and hot soup and chili at the local cafe, picked up some more bottles of wine for relaxing at the Inn, did a little bit of shopping and then it was already time to spend some lounging time together and to get ready for dinner. Back at the Inn, we tried some local cheeses and stuffed olives with some wines while playing Taboo. Janeczkos vs. Freedmans, Ladies vs. Men, and it got pretty competitive. Jacquie opened up all of her birthday presents while we had some more great wine and then got ready for the dinner we had all been waiting for. The two dinners I have had at the North Fork Table & Innreally are up there with some of the best meals I have had in my life. I am amazed by what incredible and inventive things they are doing out there- and they focus on local, fresh, seasonal ingredients. I started with the pasta- a housemade ricotta cavatelli & porcini mushrooms with parmigiano reggiano, wild arugula, crosnes, and sage. For my entree, I had the Meyers naturally-raised grass-fed N.Y. strip steak medium rare with local yukon gold potato puree, swiss chard, baby carrots, and red wine-horseradish jus. Just typing it now makes my mouth water. I am not normally a dessert fan (opting for an after dinner drink or cheese plate instead), but we went all out on the desserts at this festive feast, and I do have to say that the coffee-toffee ice cream sandwich with roasted bananas and salty peanuts was heavenly. There was also a spicy pumpkin cheesecake that blew my mind. The service could not have been better with all of our meals presented in unison by a well-trained staff. Our waiter was from Morocco and guided us to an amazing Moroccan red wine that I would have never though of ordering on my own. By the time the last bite of warm sugar & spice doughnut was snatched up, we were the last people in the restaurant. Thank goodness we were at our home away from home, because I don't think we could have all squeezed back in our coats after such an indulgent meal. Here are some pics from our phenomenal meal at the Inn. Day 3, Sunday: After so much food and wine, how could I even think of breakfast? The steaming hot biscuits topped with a scramble of egg, cheddar cheese, onion and herbs changed my mind. We popped open a bottle of bubbly to make some mimosas and to toast our fabulous weekend away. After we packed up and checked out there were still a couple stops to make... Stop 1: Vineyard 48 in Cutchogue, New York. Gary had a friend whose brother made wine at Vineyard 48, so we decided to stop by as soon as it opened for our first tasting of the day. We enjoyed the sauvignon blanc and took home a bottle, but Charles and Gary were more interested in the collection of Chess sets and challenged each other to a game while Andy, Jacquie, and I tasted. Stop 2: Peconic Bay Winery in Cutchogue, New York. Peconic Bay was our last winery stop of the weekend and it was the perfect choice. We wanted to hit up a couple more wineries, but Donna and Charles had a flight back Atlanta so we had to make it to LaGuardia in time. We were shocked by the renovation of the tasting room, but were so pleasantly surprised to see that our favorite wine tasting guide was still there with his famous pretzels and dipping mustard to go along with the Riesling. The tasting bar was renovated into a long, roomy bar with wine barrel bar stools. It was still cozy and quaint. Boy were we surprised to see Pascal who we had met and spent time with over a year ago when he worked at Shinn. Pascal was a delight and got us caught up on all the changes at Peconic Bay. Everybody LOVED these wines, especially the Riesling and the late harvest Polaris. The 2001 Merlot Oregon Hills Reserve was also a real treat. Peconic now offers three tasting options, a Reserve Tasting, or Flight 1 or 2. We mixed it up a bit, so we could all try each others favorites off the different flights. After our tastings and purchases, Barbara, Jacquie, and Gary parted ways to try to find some local produce and to head back to Westchester and Connecticut. We were headed to find our Christmas Tree, then for a last stop at Love Lane Kitchen before ending up at LaGuardia. After an amazing weekend of the best wine, food, and company we could hope for, it was very sad to say goodbye, but we know we will all be back. We already started to plan our next weekend getaway in the spring and to all our NOFO friends, we say cheers and happy holidays!

How was the service at Love Lane Kitchen? We've always liked the food (loved some) but we've had a lot of bad service there. I usually chalk it up to the newness and seasonal labor pool, but my wife isn't as patient (she's the former server in the family).

I've overheard Gary telling our friends if they want the California Wine Country experience without traveling cross country to definitely visit NOFO, as we will do again and again and again (we hope with you and Andy as well).

We've been hearing about some great happy hour deals around the city. Here are a few that stand out: BoozyNYC points out another to add to the growing list of burger + beer specials. This one's at Stand (E. 12th b/t Univ. Pl & 5th Ave). Get 2 for 1 burgers everyday between 3-5pm. Also, from 5-7pm everyday get a free beer with your burger. We're not talkin' Bud Light or Natty Light either. Stand has a great list of beers on tap, including offerings from Victory, Dogfish Head and Sixpoint. Find the current list here on BeerMenus. Jill loves that they have Victory Golden Monkey on tap (her favorite beer). I've had the burgers, and while they're not quite Molly's, Burger Joint or Corner Bistro, they're pretty darn good. Draft beers are always $5 by the glass and Stand is one of the few places where you can order by the pitcher ($20). Some more happy hour specials, including where to find cheap wing deals and a happy hour for wine lovers from BoozyNYC, after the jump... Been hearing about the 'extended play' happy hour special at LES spot Verlaine (Rivington nr Essex) for quite some time now. Here, the lychee martinis are only $5 between 5 and 10pm 7 days a week. Both SushiSamba NYC locations are offering low-priced $2 to $4 menu items (spicy crunchy tuna roll, japanese chicken wings, chilled oyster sampler, yellowtail ceviche, etc) on Sundays-Thursdays from 4-7pm and then again from 10pm-close in what they call \"reverse happy hour.\" Click here for one of the most comprehensive list of chicken wing specials around.

Making Sense of the Houston's-Hillstone Debacle: Did it Have to Come to This?
***AUTHOR
Andy
***DATE
2008-12-18 16:28:00
***CONTENT
By now you may have heard that Houston's, with NYC locations on Park Avenue South and East 53rd Street, is changing its name to Hillstone Manhattan, and with that, also changing its concept to a more seasonal focus. I found out about it yesterday from this post on Eater. This has left a lot of people scratchin' their heads. Seems like the gut reaction so far is \"What the Hell Are They Thinking?\" The Houston's name has an incredibly strong brand identity and Houston's is widely heralded as an upscale chain with great, consistent food and quality service. I for one grew up going to Houston's in Atlanta with my parents on a fairly regular basis and the location at 53rd and 3rd is a go-to spot for Jill and I - everything is consistently spot-on good from the hickory burger and the famed spinach and artichoke dip, to the fall-off-the bone ribs, grilled chicken salad, french dip au jus and chicken fingers (an off-the-menu secret item). We also love the affordable wine list that includes several local selections from the North Fork and Finger Lakes. To us, it's the ideal 'non-chainy' chain restaurant. So, what's really goin' on here? An astute Eater commenter, Industry Folk, posted: \"My theory is that the re-branding MUST take place or else Houston's will have to post calorie counts on all their menu items, as mandated by the New York DOH on all restaurant chains.\" My interest was piqued. Could it really be that a huge restaurant group with over 50 restaurants nationwide was going through a massive (and undoubtedly expensive) re-branding just to avoid having to post calories on all menu items in accordance with Section 81.50 of the New York City Health Code? According to another Eater commenter, DjR, \"I was told by a former manager that the reason they changed names was so that they didn't have to post calorie counts.\" Is it really worth risking all the goodwill and brand cachet Houston's had built up over the decades? I decided to poke my head under the covers a bit and see what I could dig up. Find a legal analysis of Section 81.50 of the NYC Health Code, whether Houston's, I mean Hillstone, no I mean Houston's, received good legal and marketing advice, and see if Hillstone is just maybe stealing its name and concept from Blue Hill at Stone Barns, one of our favorite all-time places after the jump... Most everyone is aware of the legal battles that ensued over whether New York City could force restaurant chains to list calorie count on menus. In April of this year a federal judge ruled that New York City could indeed force restaurant chains (with 15 or more outlets across the country) to post calories on their menus since such regulation is not preempted by federal law. I thought the purpose of this new “calorie-count” regulation was to protect against obesity by forcing fast-food chains to post calories for people that otherwise didn’t realize a Double Whopper with cheese is fattening. Was it intended for this legislation to also apply to upscale chain restaurants in NYC like Houston’s? To get to the bottom of this, I decided to put my legal cap on. I dug up the NYC Dept of Health’s Notice of Adoption of Section 81.50 and the language of the regulation. I also found a Calorie-Posting Compliance Guide for Restaurant Operators on the New York City Department of Health & Mental Hygiene website. The background section of 81.50 discusses obesity as an epidemic and as a serious and increasing cause of disease (includes an interesting chart on how obesity prevalence in NYC increased by more than 70% between 1994 and 2004). Hmm, here I always thought New Yorkers were fit cause we walk around so damn much. The background goes on to provide some helpful insights about things you may not know, like “weight gain occurs when more calories are consumed than are expended.” Next it goes on to describe how Americans are eating out more now and that diners eat larger portions out than they do at home. Then it discusses how fast-food chains serve food that is associated with excess calorie consumption and weight gain and that about 90% of restaurant chains in New York City serve fast-food. They also provide data to show that people who eat at fast-food establishments consume more calories. While the background section briefly discusses casual dining chains, the vast majority of it focuses on fast-food chains specifically...and nowhere does it mention anything about a connection between upscale food chains and obesity. The regulation further states the measure is narrowly tailored. Not so sure about that. If it’s so narrowly tailored, then why is this happening to Houston’s and who may be next? Here’s the language that matters — the specific language of the regulation, and in particular, the definition of “Covered Food Service Establishment.” Covered food service establishment shall mean a food service establishment within the City of NewYork that is one of a group of 15 or more food service establishments doing business nationally, offering for sale substantially the same menu items, in servings that are standardized for portion size and content, that operate under common ownership or control, or as franchised outlets of a parent business, or do business under the same name. First off, I think it’s BS for a local NYC health regulation to have criteria that is based upon the # of chains nationally. It should be based on how many locations are here in NYC. Perhaps, this could have more ‘narrowly tailored’ the minimum requirement. Upscale chains like Houston’s would not have found themselves caught up in this calorie-count mess under such a definition. The use of a broad catch-all definition means this applies to many more, perhaps unintended, restaurant chains. So, it appears Houston’s legal looked at this definition and then advised as to certain changes that, if made, would help Houston’s evade the overbroad definition. Here’s what they did: The most important criteria for the definition is the following: \"a group of 15 or more food service establishments doing business nationally, offering for sale substantially the same menu items, in servings that are standardized for portion size and content.\" They apparently advised Houston’s to change the concept. Hence, on the Hillstone website, it reads “Hillstone in New York City — two restaurants with an elevated, made from scratch cuisine featuring the American classics our guests have come to expect and love.” There has been talk about introduction of a new, seasonal menu, but looking at the menu on Hillside’s website, everything looks the same (at least for now). Will be difficult for Hillside to evade this requirement if they continue to feature the American classics people like me have grown to love at Houston's. Sounds like substantially the same menu items to me. If they can get around this criteria about the same menu items, however, then the other criteria would not come into play (i.e., the same name or common ownership/control) and the restaurant would not be deemed a ‘Covered Food Service Establishment.’ It's clear that just changing the name alone won't cut it if Houston's and Hillstone remain under common control or ownership and serve the same menu items. Here’s a criteria of the definition that will be an issue for Houston’s if they are ever challenged as being in violation of this regulation and its found that Hillstone offers \"substantially the same menu items\" as Houston's restaurants around the nation: “a group of 15 or more food service establishments doing business nationally…that operate under common ownership or control, or as franchised outlets of a parent business, or do business under the same name.” They were apparently advised the obvious, change the name. Now, there are only 2 Hillstone Manhattan’s. However, the overbroad definition uses ‘or’s’, not ‘and’s’ so they still have to worry about operating under the same ownership. Not sure how they would demonstrate this one. Clearly, by looking at the website, Houston's, Hillstone and the other restaurants in the Houston's restaurant group are operating under common ownership or control. Even if they set up a separate entity for the Hillstone restaurants, they would be hard-pressed to show that they are not under the same ‘control’ as the other restaurants in the Houston’s restaurant group. What’s funny (and sad) is that they didn’t really have to change the name to avoid being a ‘covered’ restaurant under the regulation…so long as they change the menu items at Hillstone so they are not substantially the same as at Houston's...but then it's not really Houston's, right? So it appears that the only reason they changed the name was so as to avoid confusion among customers who dine at Houston’s restaurants across the nation only to find different menu concepts and items at different places, i.e. more about brand identity and marketing than legal. Bottom line: I’ll be upset if Houston’s/Hillstone in Manhattan replaces the staples from its menu that I’ve grown to love. Based on my read of the regulation, if they don’t substantially change the menu items then they will be potentially vulnerable to being in violation of this regulation. On a different note, another astute Eater commenter, Seyo, wrote: “[Hillstone] Sounds like a ripoff of Blue Hill at the Stone Barns.” Can’t say I disagree, either. I commented back that: “Industry folk is dead on…great call. that’s exactly it. can you imagine how many calories are in that spinach and artichoke dip. Seyo is dead-on, too. Total rip of Blue Hill at Stone Barns…they even put a pic of a cow on the Hillstone web site that looks eerily similar to Blue Hill Stone Barn’s cow logo. Unreal. I love Houston’s. Better not take away the hickory burger, french dip or ribs…i don’t give a damn what season it is.” We’ll have to stay tuned to see how this situation unfolds.

OK, so here's the scoop from an employee. Our owner and founder, George Biel, started his concept with his first Houston's restaurant in Tennessee over 30 years ago, and has since spread to bustling areas around the country. Houston's is not his only restaurant. Others include Bandera Grill, Cherry Creek Grill, Rutherford Grill, Cafe R&D, and others. Please visit http://www.hillstone.com to see all our locations and menus. While our family of restaurants operate under the same code of ethics with regards to service and food preparation (utilizing local purveyors, offering great value for freshly in-house made food, choosing small-production wines for sale at far below industry standard mark-ups, etc), the reason for the different names is to reflect our collective family of restaurants. Hillstone is not something coined to mirror another company or brand. Rather, it is the name of George's vineyard, and at the Lexington and 53rd location, we offer Hillstone wine among our by-the-bottle choices.

First Taste: Craftbar ATL

Hungry for dinner and without reservations, the wife and I couldn't bring ourselves to drive past CRAFT opening weekend here in ATL. We were hoping to squeeze in for a first taste at CRAFTBAR—the looser downstairs sister boasting a recession special menu with entrees under 25 bucks. Although the upstairs was packed, within minutes of our 9PM arrival, we were seated by the small but insanely organized open kitchen. Front and center is owner/chef Tom Colicchio's concept wood-burning stove. It's one of those mother-of-all kitchen creations that most cooks can only dream about, waking up hungry. Once seated, we quickly opened the small menu of wintry interpretations and ATL firsts. The signature drink section on the first page drew us in like thirsty camels and we ordered both a Lions Head and a Sunshine Squeeze. They tasted true to their names: the Lions Head, a sophisticated whiskey/bitters martini; the Sunshine Squeeze, a happy kettle one mixer with lemon and muddled ginger. See if the food lives up to our high expectations after the jump... For the first course, we split the steak tartar and a baby romaine caesar with white anchovies. The tartar was a rustic ode; the raw meat diced into micro cubes, served in a small cast iron trough. The plate was completed with homemade waffle potato chips, a trinity of pickled veggies, and a dollop of whole-grain mustard. I thought that this tartar was excellent, and an interesting new take on the classic. It was not a “wet” tartar as you would expect; the dish was dictated by the unique dicing of the meat and fat. The small cubes fit perfectly into the spaces in the waffle chip-amazing. The salad was delicious. Baby hearts of romaine bathed in a caesar emulsification. We cut it with our butter knife. The fresh white anchovies added the perfect, naturally salted touch to finish the dish. For our main courses, I ordered the Lamb Tenderloin with a fresh mint yogurt, chickpeas, and spinach. The dish was a true Mediterranean classic, probably prepared the same way hundreds of years ago over a similar wood-fire grill. The chick peas, fresh olive oil, yogurt and mint all mixed together for a blissful last bite. Wife ordered the famous Veal Ricotta Meatballs with homemade tagliatelle. Colicchio channels the spirit of an Italian octogenarian in this hearty, hand-made dish. The meatballs are perfect in every fashion; soft and delicate in form, bold and hearty in taste. On both meals, the presentation was classic. The proportions were a bit on the light side, my wife and I cleaning our plates. But we had dessert to attend to. For our final course, I stepped it up and asked our waiter if we could re-locate to the big sofa table in the back that was moments before relinquished. The waiter was more than willing to oblige, confirming its “best table” status. In such a relaxed position, it was too easy to order both the home-made smores and the ginger-beer cream-sickle float. The smores were divine: perfectly melted California chocolate coated a warm, homemade, vanilla-bean marshmallow, sandwiched between two freshly baked graham crackers. Summer camp has nothing on this; think sandwich of the gods. The wife and I coined this the, “Death Penalty Dessert,” as we concluded that if you disliked this dessert, you should have your gene pool phased out. We knew that we had picked the perfect drink to wash everything down as soon as we fished our straws out of the cold fountain glass. The cream-sickle float had chunks of gingerbread and oranges throughout. Subsequently, it was gone in 60 seconds with the help of the long spoons provided. The perfect ending to another great meal. As far as our first taste goes, we had no doubts that CRAFT/CRAFTBAR would live up to its high expectations. With his warm, rustic flair, Colicchio’s New York concept feels right at home. After all, this isn’t the first time Atlanta has seen the power of a northerner who likes to play with fire. We will be back.

Thanks to a comment from byob lover to our Kuma Inn BYO review, we learned about BYOBLocator (http://www.byoblocator.com). This will be an amazing online resource for BYOB lovers everywhere when it takes off. BYOBLocator is in its infancy and really needs people like us to log on and spread the word about BYOB spots in their locale. The site creators designed an engine so that anyone can add a BYOB that others can then search for. It's completely free, but how valuable it ultimately becomes depends on input from users and restaurant owners. BYOB owners can enter information about their BYOB and update it regularly. BYOB Locator will be adding more features soon such as ability for BYOB owners to add and update their menus. Right now there are no results when you type in NYC area zip codes. Let's see if we can change that. In addition to these, I'm adding the following to BYOBLocator as we speak: BYO is back at Persimmon Kimchi House (1st Ave. & 10th) Sigiri Sri Lanka Restaurant (1st Ave b/t 5th & 6th) Free corkage Monday nights at Tribeca Grill (Greenwich and Franklin) SHARETHIS.addEntry({ title: \"BYO Madness!\", url: \"http://www.winedanddined.com/2008/12/byo-nyc/\" });

Just saw that Astor Wines & Spirits (Lafayette @ E. 4th) is offering some INSANE deals on some of its best-selling wines of 2008. We're talkin' Two-Buck Chuck prices folks. A tempranillo for $4.99! An Argentinian red for $3.99! A prosecco for $4.99! The best part is that you can sample them all at a free tasting tonight at Astor between 6-8pm and decide which ones to buy. These would make for terrific holiday gifts and stocking stuffers. The Top 5 Under $5 Pack includes five of their best-selling wines and an Astor tote bag for just $23.95. One friggin' martini in Paris cost me more than that.

It seems like there has been some reverse migration going on. While some well-known, old-time Atlanta chefs and restaurateurs have recently up and left the ATL for NYC (first it was Joel Antunes of Joël heading to NYC for a position at the Oak Room at the newly refurbished Plaza Hotel -- check out today's NYPost review here - and then it was world-class sushi chef Sotohiro Kosugi dealing the ATL a blow by announcing his plans to close his popular Atlanta Japanese restaurant, Soto, to open one in New York), some big-name NYC chefs are breaking on to the ATL dining scene in a major way. Celeb chefs Tom Colicchio, Laurent Tourondel and Jean-Georges Vongerichten are blanketing the ATL with new locations of their famous food franchises, making the ATL the next big culinary destination in the eyes of many. Tom Colicchio opened Craft Atlanta and Craftbar in front of The Mansion on Peachtree. “We’re excited to come to Atlanta, a city with great food culture,” Colicchio says. “The wealth of local farms and artisanal producers here make it an ideal home for Craft.” Chef Kevin Maxey of Craft Dallas is in charge of the kitchen. BLT Steak opens in Allen Plaza’s new W Atlanta Downtown next month. “Atlanta is a great city with an emerging culinary scene, and I am excited to have BLT Steak be a part of the development of this city as a new food destination,” Laurent Tourondel says. “I love the energy of the city, and I think BLT Steak will match the personalities in Atlanta.” Will be interesting to see how BLT Steak stacks up against some old-school ATL steakhouses like Chops, Bone’s and Kevin Rathbun Steak. Chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten opened a Spice Market outpost in April inside the W Atlanta Midtown. “Atlanta’s evolving dining scene continues to draw my attention to the South,” Vongerichten says. “The city’s culinary diversity makes it an ideal home for a concept like Spice Market.” But he didn't stop there. In November, Vongerichten opened Market, a chic comfort food concept, in the new W Buckhead. Wined & Dined has you covered with some loyal blog readers down in the 404 who will be checking out some of these new celeb chef outposts, as well as other spots in the Dirty South, and reporting back to us. Will these new splashy restaurants bearing celebrity chef names become the next wave of the ATL dining scene or are they merely a temporary trend until a new band of local culinary talent emerges? Is the ATL becoming a dining destination like NYC? ATL didn't seem to take well to Emeril's outpost. Be on the look out for reviews from guest contributors Adam Kramer and Scott Solomon who have their fingers on the pulse of the ATL dining scene. In fact, Adam and wife Elyssa hit up Craftbar ATL this past weekend and Adam's review will be up on the site soon. We're also lookin' forward to hearing about the gastropub craze that is taking over the ATL...oh yeah, and someone's gotta send us some pics of the burgers from Ann's Snack Bar (the WSJ called it the \"Best Hamburger in America.\") SHARETHIS.addEntry({ title: \"NYC vs. the ATL\", url: \"http://www.winedanddined.com/2008/12/nyc-vs-the-atl/\" });

We had a pretty nice (and very spontaneous) little Saturday...first we went to a free wine tasting of Long Island wines at Union Square Wines where we spoke with Kareem Massoud, Paumanok Vineyard's winemaker, and tried Paumanok's 2007 Sauvignon Blanc and Chenin Blanc, as well as its 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon and Late Harvest Sauvignon Blanc (delicious -- we took a bottle of this home with us). We also tried about 10 wines from Channing Daughters Winery and met winemaker Christopher Tracy. Yeah, we bought a few bottles of wine then headed to Blind Tiger Ale House in the West Village for some beers and chili, stuff like that. I had a Bear Republic Racer 5 IPA and a cask Brooklyn IPA, while Jill enjoyed a Lagunitas Maximus and a Stone Arrogant Bastard. We both agreed that the chili was the best we've had in the city. Was also thinking about trying the hot wings, which were recently lauded by NYC Food Guy in a post on NYC's Best Wings. Next, we were off to grab an early bite at The Spotted Pig, but didn't know there would be a 2+ hour wait for a table at 5:30pm. Unbelievable. So, we left there and then stopped in for a drink at Whitehorse Tavern a block away where all the talk was about the spate of recent muggings in the area (even saw a news truck interviewing people about these). More on our fun Saturday, including a comedy show, after the jump... Leaving Whitehorse Tavern, the idea was to head home and order in Indian food and open a bottle of our new wine. Here's where things got a bit spontaneous...on the way back east to our place, the car drove right by Gotham Comedy Club and Jill noticed on the sign that a show was starting in 20 minutes at 7pm. We looked at each other and said 'yeah, lets do it.' We had the driver pull over at the next block and proceeded to purchase 2 seats. The guy told us it was going to be a pretty full show, but that he was putting us at the front and center table. The show was Rob Bartlett’s Christmas Cavalcade. We soon found out why they put us where they did...we were used for about 20 minutes of material and it was hilarious. Everything from how we met at LaGuardia Airport and celebrate Christmakkah to the fact that we're both attorneys and were wearing what he described as slippers to the club. He actually took our shoes off our feet and showed them to the audience. Mine were UGG's and Jill was wearing her Tom's. Everyone came over to us after the show and congratulated us as if we had just performed on stage. Rob called us over afterwards and thanked us for being good sports. We had a blast. Finally, we headed home and ordered in Indian. We were so beat we were barely awake when it arrived. Crazy day.

Thanks to this post on Cellarette, I found out about another top 100 wine list. This one's from Wine.com. The 2008 edition of the Wine.com 100 marks the second year the online wine retailer has compiled a top 100 list based entirely on customer preferences. The ranking reflects the top 1% of wines sold nationally on Wine.com during 2008. While many publications rank wines based on the opinions of wine critics, customers are the judge here by voting with their dollars.The Wine.com 100 list shows customers are choosing both quality and price, with 94 of the wines rated 90 points or higher from leading wine publications and over 70 wines priced under $20. This list is a great resource for discovering some high-quality, recession-proof value wines. What I also like about this list is that most of the bottles are widely available at wine shops across the country. The ones that you should look for after the jump... Most of the great values here are from Chile, Argentina, Australia, Spain and New Zealand. Here are our Top 10 Values from the Wine.com Top 100: #1 out of 100 Veramonte Cabernet Sauvignon Reserva 2006 (Chile) - Cabernet Sauvignon -- $10 #4 out of 100 Cristalino Brut Cava Non-Vintage (Spain) - $8 #7 out of 100 Kim Crawford Sauvignon Blanc 2007 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough, New Zealand) - $15 #11 out of 100 Don Rodolfo Malbec 2005 Malbec (Argentina) - $10 #18 out of 100 A to Z Pinot Noir 2006 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley, Oregon) - $19 #33 out of 100 Nobilo Sauvignon Blanc 2007 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough, New Zealand) - most wines across the country carry this bang-for-your-buck New Zealand white and we've seen it for as little as $8 a bottle. #35 out of 100 Penfolds Koonunga Hill Shiraz-Cabernet 2006 (Australia) - like the Nobilo above, most wine stores across the country carry this great value wine. Our friend Jordan loves it. It's one of the few Australian reds you can get for under $10. #36 out of 100 Avalon Napa Cabernet Sauvignon 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley) - we've had this wine a lot over the past year and it's a great value at $14. #46 out of 100 Santa Rita Carmenere Reserva 2006 Carmenere (Chile) - one of the first wines we fell in love with was a carmenere -- click here to check it out. Haven't tried this one, but at $11 we'll be giving it a go soon. #69 out of 100 Bitch Grenache 2006 Grenache (Barossa Valley, Australia) - don't be fooled by the 'trying to hard to be cutesy' name, Bitch makes some great wines. You should be able to find this Bitch for about $11.

This just in from roving reporter and food fan Scott Solomon down in Atl. Scott and wife Meredith stopped in at Flip (Blais from Top Chef's new burger spot) for dinner last night on just it's second night of service. You will be hearing more from Scott here on Wined&Dined in the future as he wines and dines it up in the Atl (my hometown). We're particularly lookin' forward to hearing whether all the celeb chef outposts opening in the Atl live up to their NYC reputations (talkin' about Craft, Craftbar, Spice Market, BLT Steak, Il Mulino, etc.): \"Blais was very engaging, going around and talking with every customer, and checking up on everyone. He was very interested in getting real feedback. Cool decor, i love those tvs that are framed like mirrors (pic below). Great atmosphere..place was packed, hard to park, good music and vibe. Bar packed too. Liquid nitrogen tanks in the corner. Every few minutes Richard would go over there and concoct milkshakes and drinks with the nitrogen. Meredith (and I) loved the fries.. he said it is a 3 day process of blanching, liquid nitrogen, duck fat, peanut oil etc. Perfectly crispy outside- real Frites!!\" More of Scott's first impressions (and pics) after the jump... Burgers are inventive, he said people average sharing 3 for 2 people. Regular burger good, but not Shake Shack good. Had a vinegary taste, probably from the pickles. Pork belly burger was amazing!! Salty and juicy, it was heaven on a bun. Butcher cut was very good too...demi glaze and bleu cheese. Very rich, you lose the taste of the beef, but i think thats the point- creativity with different burgers, sauces etc.. I think the thing here is trying all the different burgers in different styles. soup of the day was a chili, burger of the day a tuna tartare burger. I saw liquid nitrogen margaritas and milkshakes (nutella, pistachio, crispy creme), but stuck to beer...\" Flip Burgers TV's Look Like Mirrors Frites!

Jean-Georges' Heartfelt Gift of $24 Lunch/$35 Dinner Recession Specials

This could be the ultimate recession special. Just read a post titled ‘My Gift to You This Season’ on Jean-Georges’ personal blog. He writes, “I sincerely believe that great food lifts your spirits, that a beautiful restaurant serves as an escape. I’ve created my restaurants to be places that offer a gracious welcome, that pamper our guests with delicious food and friendly service. And now I want to extend more generosity to my fellow New Yorkers. I’m offering prix-fixe lunch for $24 and prix-fixe dinner for $35 at my restaurants in the city.” More on the JG recession specials after the jump… Jean-Georges calls Matsugen \"the best deal, by far.\" It may just be that Matsugen, which opened in Tribeca in June directly into the economic headwinds of the recession, is hurting a bit. According to the blog, \"In this mini-omakase dinner menu, you get six courses, including the black cod with miso and the Kamoseiro duck soup with soba noodles. It's a deeply satisfying meal that gives you a true taste of Japan. I also love the bento box lunch because one of the four courses is the goma-dare soba, my favorite dish there.\" N.B. -- Nougatine, JoJo and Perry St. only offer the $35 dinner menus before 6:30pm and after 10pm (for Perry St. it's after 9:30pm). Available at Matsugen and Vong all the time. Interesting that the blog post mentions nothing about his NYC flagship restaurant. We'll do some research and let you know what we find out.

Andy and I have been dying to try Kuma Inn for ages. After having to cancel a couple of reservations, we finally made it to Kuma Inn with Donna and Charles in from Atlanta and with our friend Gassan. In harsh economic times, BYOBs are a great choice for those of us who normally have a heftier wine bill than food bill when we go out to eat. We heard great things about Kuma Inn and we were not disappointed. Kuma Inn is located at 113 Ludlow between Delancey and Rivington on the Lower East Side. The first time we attempted to give it a try we could not even find it, because it is hidden up a narrow staircase on the second floor of the building. This time there was a blackboard on the sidewalk with an arrow, so we could not miss it. After having a couple of strong ales at Spitzer's (only 1/2 a block away), one of our favorite beer bars, we were hungry for dinner. We headed up the stairs and were immediately faced with the small open kitchen and the cooler (keeping various bottles of sake, wine, and ingredients cold) in the tiny waiting area. We were seated right away and were ready to start our own tasting of Kuma Inn small plates. More on our Kuma Inn BYO extravaganza after the jump... Kuma Inn descibes its food as \"Southeast Asian-style tapas.\" The chef, King Phojanakong, a \"Thai-Filipino New Yorker\" has cooked for Bouley and Boulud, but there is definitely no foie gras or truffles on this menu! The flavors of the small plates are certainly Asian but are vibrant and inventive. We brought four bottles of wine with us and went through them all (Note- $5 corkage fee per bottle) as we embarked on our tasting adventure ordering at least 3 separate rounds of dishes. We tried so much it is hard to describe each dish, but I've listed our favorites and the ones we wished we skipped below. We truly feasted at Kuma Inn and it was hard not to continue the ordering frenzy after tasting such wonderful dishes, but beware that Kuma Inn is cash only so you may want to stop by an ATM before devouring the scrumptious small plates like this is your last supper- they do add up in the end! Our Favorites: (photos that follow were taken by a much more highly skilled food photog than us, Tina Wong, aka The Wandering Eater) * Deep fried pork belly lechon kawali with atchara (pork belly + fried = mmmmm....) * Yellowfin tuna tartare with a rice noodle crisp (Fresh yellowfin with nice citrus balance- another please) * Sautéed chinese sausage with thai chili-lime sauce (Something a bit different for an Asian plate and the sauce was incredible) * Shrimp Shumai (A special for the day- not like any other shrimp shumai I've ever tasted!) * Pork Buns (Another special for the day- savory pulled pork and plump round buns) * Asian Paella (You MUST try this) * Steamed edamame with thai basil-lime oil (A staple snack with a different twist- loved the oil) Ones we would Skip: * Grilled baby octopus with pickled bamboo shoots (Needed some sauce for the grilled octopus) * Grilled salmon, shitake mushrooms & baby bok choy (Good classic dish, but too much else to try!) * Sautéed tofu, thai basil and wood ears in spicy soy mirin (Also tasty, but other veggie options were more spicy and flavorful) SHARETHIS.addEntry({ title: \"BYOB Bliss: The Many Tastes of Kuma Inn\", url: \"http://www.winedanddined.com/2008/12/byo-kuma-inn-nyc/\" });

hey byob lover- thanks for the tip. that site's awesome. we'll do a post about it. in these tough times, byo's are the ultimate way to eat out....especially if you drink as much as jill and i do. our wine/liquor tab is almost always more than our food tab. i hate paying huge mark-ups on wine. the more i'm getting to know my wines, the more i see places that serve a glass for more than it costs for the bottle at a wine shop.

Thanks to our friend Leena for forwarding us a NYT Diner's Journal blog post about La Cave des Fondus, a new spot opening today in Soho at Prince and Elizabeth, that gives whole new meaning to the term 'bottle service.' Suck on this -- wine and beer will be served to customers baby boomers in baby bottles. Guess they were out of sippy cups. Apparently, this bizarre concept is modeled after a Paris restaurant Le Refuge des Fondus. If like us you're having trouble imagining people 'whining and dining' with baby bottles, click here to watch it in action. Oh yeah, they'll also be serving different types of fondue...but you have to eat it out of a crazy straw.

Top Chef's Richard Blais Opens Flip Burger Boutique in Atlanta (Is NYC Next?)

While NYC food bloggers are hyping City Burger's new so-called Pat La Frieda Black Label burger mix, word has it from our friend Adam Kramer that Season 4 Top Chef finalist and gastro-guru Richard Blais (our favorite contestant) has opened Flip Burger Boutique down in the Atl. Flip's website is up n' runnin'. Hints that Flip may be comin' to NYC and some early pics after the jump... According to the press release, Blais is Flip's creative director. “The menu I developed for Flip was a challenge I was up for,” says Blais. “It was fun to take something so common, like the burger, and give it a modern twist.” Some feature items include organic beef with homemade ketchup and mayonnaise; a po “boyger” with grilled shrimp, fried lemon and spicy tartar sauce; a lamb burger with green olive relish and raisin ketchup on a rosemary bun; and an authentic Kobe burger, utilizing fresh beef imported from Japan, dressed with herbal butter, red onion marmalade and blue cheese. Flip will grind their signature beef burger using short ribs, hanger steak and brisket. Balancing out the menu, a variety of vegetable burgers will also be available, creating a selection suitable for all taste palates. The burgers will be smaller than the traditional burger to encourage diners to indulge in more than one. The edgy, unconventional decor includes communal seating, reflecting ceiling elements, a chefs table and a classic diner feel. We're guessin' Atlanta will be flippin' for a while over this place. Some early reviews are already in from friends and family pre-opening dinners. Here is a great photo slide show and what The Blissful Glutton has to report after a recent visit. Apparently Blais will continue to practice his molecular gastronomy at Flip's liquid-nitrogen milk-shake bar. Jill and I got a chance to try his 'popcornsicles' made with liquid nitrogen this summer at Garrett Popcorn here in NYC. Blais has been hinting that a Manhattan outpost may be in the offing. As Blais, a New York native, told TimeOut NY about Flip in July: \"[New York] is the next market we're looking to hit.\" Here are some teasers from Flip's menu (full menu here) BEEF BURGERS CORNED BEEF + CABBBAGE + POACHED EGG 7 SMOKED BEEF + COLE SLAW + RBQ SAUCE 7 PHILLY + CHEESE WHIZ FOAM + GREEN PEPPERS 7 BEEF TARTARE + CAPERS + AIOLI + CORNICHONS 11 BUTCHER + CARAMELIZED ONION + BLUE CHEESE + RED WINE JAM 8 COUNTRY FRIED + PIMENTO CHEESE + PICKLED OKRA 7 DELUXE + FOIE GRAS + WAGYU BEEF + SHAVED TRUFFLE 24 OTHER BURGERS TURKEY + MUSHROOM + POBLANO + AVOCADO PEPPER JACK 6 FAUX BURGER + FARM HOUSE CHEESE + SWEET SOY KETCHUP 7 FLIP SIDES 4 SWEET POTATO TOTS FRENCH FRIES TEMPURA RUTABAGA VODKA BATTERED ONION RINGS Finish it all with an aptly southern Krispy Kreme or sweet tea milkshake.

It's yummy! Went the other day with friends and had the Butcher burger, tater-tot sweet potatoes; sampled the fries, vodka battered onion rings and sampled someone's Nutella chocolate milkshake-very good. Had their house margarita which did not really impress. Only annoyance was the long 45 minute wait to get in-they don't take reservations and they seem to remember you by the clothing you're wearing...they were looking for my sister-in-law's v neck sweater and almost grabbed another customer by mistake-surely there's a better way! Can't wait to go back again though...

Last night was the celebration of my daughter's birthday. We had 12 people in our party. I arrived at 5:20 p.m. and the restaurant was almost filled to compacity. Other than waiting almost an hour and playing musical tables trying to fit everyone together. All of the wait staff, manager and hostess where most accommodating. The burgers were incredible, (all my guests enjoyed the ones they ordered) the food come out \"hot\" and the milkshakes were from heaven!!

went 3 nights ago on a date around 6 and luckily we arrived just before the rest of midtown came flooding in. We still had to wait 30 minutes even though it was clear that there were empty seats & tables just waiting to be sat in. Servers/waiters seemed to be in a bit of a slow mode, but could be b/c kitchen just wasn't serving slider-sized burgers quick enough. I loved the ambience of the restaurant, but burgers were just a bit on the small sized for the price. Pretty decent though. The vodka battered onion rings were the best. -note, a couple that walked in less than 5 minutes after we did were still standing around when we paid and left. I think traffic flow will be better once it's warm enough to open the outside seating.

Hi there, I work in public relations for The Empire Hotel. Just want to let everyone know, that the event is not at The Empire Hotel Rooftop, but instead at The Lobby Bar. They're two different venues. You can literally do a bar crawl within the hotel. There is The Lobby Bar, Center Cut, The Rooftop and The Pooldeck. It's a very cool place that caters to everyone. Thanks! Rachel

For some time now we have been telling our friends and family about our affection for NY's North Fork wine region. Jill's Uncle Bob called us up yesterday to tell us about a story on the North Fork that we have to check out in Sunday's NY Post Page 6 magazine. We're actually taking our family to the North Fork this weekend, so we were pretty psyched to read about how the North Fork is becoming the \"hottest weekend winery destination\" and that \"experts say now is the perfect time to visit, even though it's chilly.\" There's even a section of the story titled \"A Winter Wine Weekend: How to eat, drink, shop and relax over two days in Long Island wine country.\" Impeccable timing. All we had to do was show this story to our parents and they would know exactly what we have in store for them this weekend. The \"where to stay\" and \"where to eat and drink\" is almost the weekend we planned to a \"t\". More on our weekend itinerary after the jump We're staying at (I should say 'taking over') The North Fork Table & Inn run by the husband-wife team of Claudia Fleming (former Gramercy Tavern pastry chef) and Gerry Hayden and eating at their amazing restaurant Saturday night. Friday night we'll be dining at The Frisky Oyster in Greenport, where Eileen Duffy, the sommelier and author of the wine blog Cellarette, picks and chooses among the best local wines to comprise her wine list. We'll also be hitting up some of our favorite North Fork wineries, like Bedell and Shinn Estate, as well as a few recommended by Lenn Thompson, publisher of Lenndevours wine blog, who has become our go-to resource for information on the North Fork and Finger Lakes wine regions. Lenn is doing great things in terms of promoting and educating people about New York wine.

It is our family tradition to gather in NYC to celebrate Thanksgiving every year. That means we can toast to all that we are thankful for with some fabulous wines and appetizers in our Manhattan apartment, but cooking up a full fledged Thanksgiving feast is a bit difficult with limited oven and fridge space. So, it has become our tradition to head out for a great prix fixe Thanksgiving dinner after gathering at our place first for some homemade starters and some of our favorite local wines. Memories of Thanksgiving always put a smile on my face. The Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade on the television followed by my favorite - the National Dog Show, the smells of simmering onions, carrots, and celery filling the house, the taste of a crisp, dry New York State Riesling in hand, the loud laughs and booming conversation of family, and the anticipation of an endless amount of delicious comfort food coming my way. Does it get any better than this? This year couldn't have been more perfect. Read more about how we celebrated one of our favorite holidays after the jump... We started our day with breakfast at home- Andy an indulgent everything bagel with smoked salmon, capers, tomato, and onion from Ess-a-Bagel (and a beer) and me with my bowl of Special K (I needed to keep it light in order to gear up for some serious holiday eating). I enjoyed watching the little pups prance around the Philadelphia stage in the National Dog Show as I started putting together some appetizers. I made a homemade bruschetta on a toasted french baguette with creamy goat cheese. I mixed the freshly chopped tomatoes, garlic, basil, and lemon juice the night before so all the flavors could really blend by the time it was plated. I also made a basil, lemon, chive, olive oil, and almond puree to drizzle on some whipped ricotta on top of bagel chips and topped with rolled up slices of prosciutto. Lastly, I roasted some mushrooms and filled them with a French goat cheese and topped them with some bread crumbs that I toasted in a homemade rosemary infused olive oil. I also put together an array of toasted pita chips, Italian olive oil crackers, raw almonds, dried cranberries, roasted red pepper hummus, and classic Babaganoush. After the tables were filled with food and all the wine and cocktail mixes were arranged, it was time to relax with a 2007 Hunt Country Semi-Dry Riesling that we had picked up on our trip to the Finger Lakes. Andy's parents arrived from Atlanta and my Mom came over with my sister Jacquie and Gary. Andy's sister Stacey, and her husband Jonathan and little girl Zoe also joined us at our apartment. We popped open a magnum of Hermann J. Wiemer's 2007 Dry Riesling and a bottle of 2007 Molly Dooker Two Left Feet and 2007 Molly Dooker The Boxer. We enjoyed catching up and hearing about all of our 2008 adventures in Capri, Rome, Istanbul, Paris, Bordeaux, Turks & Caicos, Hawaii, and California. After a couple of hours of great conversation and a couple more bottles of wine, we were off to the restaurant. Every year we pick a B.R. Guest restaurant for Thanksgiving dinner. This was the second year in a row that we chose Primehouse and before that we had been to Fiamma, Blue Water Grill, and Blue Fin. Although one would not normally think of a steakhouse as a Thanksgiving restaurant destination, Primehouse was a perfect choice for its classic $42 prix fixe Thanksgiving menu. There are some great new American market-driven restaurants that have amazing Thanksgiving prix fixe menus, but at double the price (at least) of the B.R Guest restaurants. With consistent, reliable, tasty and very reasonably priced Thanksgiving meals at any of the B.R Guest restaurants open on Thanksgiving, it's an easy choice. I had the Butternut squash soup with porcini, brown butter, and creme fraiche, followed by the oven roasted turkey breast and leg confit with spiced sweet potato, fall vegetables, mashed potato, natural gravy, stuffing, and cranberry sauce (with a side skillet of extra dark meat- the very tastiest part of the turkey). For dessert, I had an apple crumb bar with autumn fruit compote and cranberry swirl ice cream. We also had a couple bottles of New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc and an Australian Grenache. After all the pre-dinner appetizers and wine, I could not finish any of my dinner plates, but everything was excellent. Once we all made it back to the apartment, we finished the night with a North Fork 2005 Corey Creek Late Harvest Riesling with more toasts and great stories. Another lively, fun, and indulgent NYC Thanksgiving- Wined & Dined style! Thank you to Charles and Donna for treating us to such an amazing holiday meal!

With Thanksgiving right around the corner, we should all take a moment to think about everything that we have to be thankful for and to think about those who may be going through very difficult times, whether health-related, job-related, etc. Thanksgiving is all about putting things in proper perspective. We wish all of our friends and family a safe, happy and healthy Thanksgiving holiday. Enjoying a bottle (or four) of wine over good conversation with our family over the holidays is just one of the many things Jill and I are especially thankful for. If you can, try to drink local wines and support your local winemakers this holiday season. In these difficult and trying economic times, it's important for us to support our nation's economy, and that includes our nation's winemakers. We'll be opening some of our favorite bottles of wine we have picked up on our trips to the North Fork and Finger Lakes. Here are what some writers around the country are recommending as some great value holiday wines to be thankful for: Thanksgiving Wine Recommendations Under $20 [AmericanWinery.com] Keep Your Thanksgiving Wine Choices Fresh (25 under $20 versatile and inexpensive red wine selections) [Seattle Times] Ten Wines for the Thanksgiving Table (Gary Vaynerchuk selects 10 under $21 wines) [Forbes] Thanksgiving Wines Under $20 that Stand Up to Smoked Turkey [Dallas Morning News] The Annual Puzzle of What to Pour [Washington Post] Best Value Wine Picks for Thanksgiving [Spirit of Wine] Thanksgiving Wine Under $20: 2008 Picks [Good Wine Under $20 Blog] ...and a couple of writers who have had enough with all the Thanksgiving wine recommendations: Stop the Thanksgiving Wine Recommendations!

Brunch Spot: Is Prune Really Worth the Wait?
***AUTHOR

***CONTENT
We were really excited to try Prune - especially after hearing it is a favorite among chefs/restaurateurs (Bourdain and Ripert swear by it) and seeing the crowds that form outside on any given Saturday and Sunday for brunch. Critics have been heaping praise upon chef Gabrielle Hamilton (Prune apparently was her childhood nickname) for years now. This past Sunday in particular was a frigid, windy Fall day, but that didn't stop us and our friends Amber and Andy from huddling with the masses to wait for a table. For those who haven't been, Prune is a pint-size restaurant in the E. Village that is quite charming in that old French country kind of way, with worn walls, antique mirrors, and open French doors. To say the place is tightly packed is an understatement. Tables are close together, just barely letting a person fit in between each table and inundating diners with lively chatter from neighboring tables. What we thought after the jump... We got to Prune right around 2:30 and we were seated by 3:00. Much better than we expected. One of the reasons the line appears so long outside is that there's no waiting by the bar. Typically, we would chill inside with a drink and wait for a table to open. Those seated just before us had been waiting closer to an hour and a half and we hear that a two hour wait time is not unusual. We actually got lucky and were able to skip a four-top ahead of us because they did not want to sit in the semi-private nook downstairs...are you kidding me? That's the only spacious spot in the house. We were already off to a good start. Things were about to get better. The server came over to take our drink order and I was about to order my typical extra spicy bloody mary before realizing there was a full bloody mary menu (see below for the bloody choices). I went with the Southwest (Herradura Anejo tequila, smoked chipotle, peppers, limes), Jill opted for the Chicago Matchbox (homemade lemon vodka, pickled brussels sprouts, baby white turnips, caperberries, green beans, and radishes), Amber chose the Classic (Absolut vodka, celery and lemon) and Andy #2 ordered the Green Lake (Absolut vodka, wasabi and a beef jerky swizzle). I think the Green Lake won with the wasabi and beef jerky swizzle, but Jill's was great, too. Best part is that every bloody comes with a side shot of beer. Great idea. For our meals, Andy and I ordered the huevos rancheros (though I was dying to try the burger, but it's not on the brunch menu), Amber got the Spaghetti a la Carbonara (mixed w/ egg, bacon, and pepper) and Jill the spicy stewed chickpeas nestle on eggs coated in buttered bread crumbs. I was struck by how small my huevos was, but it was pretty solid...nothing insane though. I thought Jill's was delicious...mediterranean flavors blended nicely in the spicy stewed chickpeas with coddled, butter-crumble-crusted eggs sitting amid the stew. Definitely something you can't get at any old diner. Jill and I also got a side of the lamb sausage, served pinwheel style and secured with a toothpick...a little pricey at $5 but pretty darn good. I think Amber's breakfast spaghetti took it though. I love going out to eat with Amber cause she always lets me clear her plate...and this was one plate I enjoyed clearing. The carbonara sauce was nice, not too greasy or eggy, and the bacon bits were crispy and very flavorful. Only thing is I couldn't really tell there was an egg component to the dish. Oh well, it was really good so it didn't bother me too much. THE VERDICT To me, for a brunch place to be worth the wait and the higher cost (slightly overpriced + no free brunch cocktail = higher cost), the dishes have to be something different and amazing... definitely has to be more special than you would get from any old place on your corner. Like, for example, Norma's 'super cheesy' french toast with applewood bacon is something different and special. At Prune, the bloody mary's are the main draw. Unfortunately, they come with a price tag. For one bloody mary and one dish, we each paid $28. With all of the wonderful brunch places in the E. Village that offer up at least one free cocktail, Prune's not worth it to me. I'll take the chicken fried steak w/ eggs + 3 drinks for $16 at Essex over my $28 Prune brunch any day. We will be back to try dinner, though. Have heard great things about the roasted marrow bones. I also don't get all the rules, which I find strange for a place that seems so chill and easy-going...no cell phones, no substitutions, no free coffee refills, etc. Didn't happen to us, but I've heard people complain about being pushed to pay and leave. Makes sense though with a place that small. ---BLOODY MARY MENU--- served w/ a shot of light beer as a chaser// $9 Classic (Absolut vodka, celery and lemon) Danish (Aquavit, fresh fennel and a whole marinated white anchovy) Bullshot (Absolut vodka, beef bouillon, Worcestershire, Tabasco) (Bloody Bull Bullshot w/ Bloody Mix) Mariner (Absolut citron vodka, clam juice and obires) Southwest (Herradura Anejo tequila, smoked chipotle, peppers, limes) Caesar (Boodles British gin, clam juice, and a pickled egg) Maria (classic w/ sangria tequila) Deadly (classic w/ Absolut vodka and a splash of sangria tequila) *Green Lake (Absolut vodka, wasabi and a beef jerky swizzle) *Chicago Matchbox (homemade lemon vodka, pickled brussels sprouts, baby white turnips, caperberries, green beans, and radishes) SHARETHIS.addEntry({ title: \"Brunch Spot: Is Prune Really Worth the Wait?\", url: \"http://www.winedanddined.com/2008/11/brunch-review-prune/\" });

BYO (for a limited time only): Motorino Pizza in Brooklyn

BYO restaurants are the best way to dull the pain of the price of dining in NYC and represent some of the city's hidden gems. The problem is not too many restaurants are willing to forgo an alcohol revenue stream with its huge mark-ups. One thing we've noticed is that restaurants will open before receiving their liquor license and operate on a temporary BYO basis. Remember this is how it was at Mercadito for a while. We received an email newsletter on Tuesday from Tasting Table alerting us to Motorino, a new restaurant in Brooklyn that's BYO for a limited time. We're gonna check it out Sat night and let you know how it goes.

WWBE: Actually, Where Wouldn't Batali Eat?

NYC & Company today announced the launch of the third phase of the Just Ask The Locals campaign that includes city dining tips from local chefs and celebs. Though the chefs and restaurateurs are quick to plug some of their own establishments, it's interesting to see some of the other places around the five boroughs they frequent and some of their favorite foods around the city...here's a taste: Eric Ripert - digs the wood-buring oven at Peasant, eats late night at Balthazar, L'Absinthe and Yakitori Totto, romances at Chanterelle, Danube and Annisa and calls Peter Luger legendary. Mario Batali -- Katz's pastrami sandwich, Morandi, Centro Vinoteca, Gottino, Spotted Pig and for a recession special he goes to Mamoun's Falafel (though I doubt he goes there cause his wallet's tight). His off the beaten path spots include Mario's in the Bronx and Ferdinando's Focacceria in Brooklyn for the spleen sandwich and panelles. Padma, Colicchio and others after the jump... Colicchio - Spotted Pig, Hearth (to see Marco Canora cooking), Terroir Wine Bar, Allen & Delancey for a romantic meal, celebrations at Masa, Gramercy Tavern, Jean Georges and Le Bernardin and the wine lists at Babbo, Per Se and Daniel (apparently someone's not hurtin' in these tough economic times) Padma Lakshmi - Shake Shack, Indochine, Peasant, Veritas, La Esquina, Daniel and a hidden gem in the E. Village -- Il Posto Accanto (next door to and same owner as Il Bagatto) Danny Meyer - his must-go places for visitors include Barbuto, Peter Luger and Prune, 2nd Ave Deli for lunch, late night eating at Spotted Pig, Yakitori Totto, Degustation, Arturo's and 'ino, and burgers at his own Blue Smoke, DB Bistro and JG Melon, and finally sushi at Gari, Sushi Ann and Sushi Yasuda. Marcus Samuelsson -- Burgers at Shake Shack and Pop Burger (really?), must-go places include Aquavit (shameless plug), Jean Georges, Republic (really?), WD-50 and Peter Luger, late night eats at Brasserie, Blue Ribbon Sushi, Florent (someone should tell him it closed), Spotted Pig and anywhere in C-town, recession specials at Dumpling House, AQ Cafe (another shameless plug), Katz's Deli, Les Ambassades and Mamoun's Falafel, and for romantic meals he recommends Prune, August, Daniel, The Elephant and Peasant. What I Learned -- apparently NYC chefs and restaurateurs love Spotted Pig (but we knew that), Prune (we figured that), Peasant (actually didn't know that), Shake Shack (who doesn't), Daniel (cause they can afford it), Mamoun's Falafel (hottest hot sauce in the city), Peter Luger (even hard for them to get in) and Katz's.

Wine Spectator announced today its much-anticipated list of the Top 100 Wines of 2008. According to WS, they reviewed more than 19,500 wines from around the world in blind tastings. More than 5,300 of them earned outstanding ratings (90 points or higher on the WS 100-point scale). They then narrowed the list down based on four criteria: quality (represented by score); value (reflected by release price); availability (measured by case production or cases imported); and an X-factor they call excitement. The final selections, however, reflect WS \"editors' judgment and passion about the wines they tasted.\" As perhaps expected, several 2005 Bordeaux (the vintage of the century) made their way onto the list, including 3 of the top 10 and 4 of the top 11 wines. Lets hope for WS's sake that no fake wines made the list. Click here if you're not sure what I'm getting at. The Top Values ($20 and under) in the Top 100 after the jump... I immediately pored through the list for the $20 and under wines and found 19 wines priced at $20 or less.

Undergrounds Unite: The Full 12-Course Tasting Menu
***AUTHOR
Andy
***DATE
2008-11-16 19:11:00
***CONTENT
We attended the Undergrounds Unite 12-course Thanksgiving-inspired feast on Friday night. Undergrounds Unite is a consortium of five of the city's underground supper clubs. Late Wednesday we got an email from UU about the undisclosed loft location where the feast would be held. Here's what it said: So, wondering how it works? -Please arrive at the Playwright (35th between 5th and 6th about halfway down the block on the North side) promptly at 7:45PM. Look for the man learning \"How to Cook Everything.\" He will direct you to the location of the feast. -At 8PM we will begin the cocktail hour. Feel free to mingle with guests, say hello to new and old friends, and choose your seat accordingly. Dinner will begin promptly at 9PM. -We will be serving wine with the event (Brooklyn Oneology), but feel free to BYO if you prefer another type of drink. The menu and more after the jump... So we headed over to Playwright Tavern a bit early not really knowing what we were looking for other than someone who was learning how to cook. There was a fellow sitting at a table by himself outside the bar who was reading a book -- but it looked more like a classic than a cookbook. Walking further into the crowded bar we spotted our guy. At the corner of the bar, a guy was sitting with a big hardback cookbook open and propped on its spine as if on display. We walked over and he handed us a map. Right about now we're feeling like we're on some sort of scavenger hunt. The map pointed us towards a building one block away on 36th and it said to head up to the 11th floor. We got there and a line for the elevator had already formed. The elevator let us out in the middle of a massive commercial duplex loft penthouse space with 2 bars set up and some couches and lounge areas. I had expected a more wanna-be hipster crowd, but everyone here was dressed very chic and stylishly. We immediately made our way to the long line at the first bar. The first half of the cocktail hour involved people waiting in the 2 cocktail bar lines and engaging in linear conversations with the people in front and behind of them. Nick behind the bar from Whisk & Ladle was the mastermind of the cocktail list, which included a bourbon with infused vidalia onion and peach (my favorite), a peanut-infused vodka, a tequila cocktail with agave and grapefruit, a vodka, cider, and champagne concoction, and lastly a gin with green tea (but we failed to try this one so don't remember the ingredients). As a little amuse bouche, they placed trays on tables with fried risotto balls with toothpicks stuck in them. We tried a couple and they were really nothing special. The lines at the bars died down as everyone had their first couple cocktails and then anxiously awaited the dinner bell to head upstairs. We took our seats at a communal table, met the people around us and then the feast began: Our one disappointing takeaway from the meal was that everything was served way too cold. Course #1 (Bread): Fresh Buttermilk Biscuits w/ Honey Butter -- Homeslice West The biscuit was quite generic and barely lukewarm. Course #2 (Raw): Fluke w/ Yuzu Kosho & Vinaigrette -- Studiofeast The fluke was delicious and I enjoyed the topping of what tasted like a chili-caramel sauce. Course #3 (Pasta): Toasted Pumpkin Agnolotti w/ Spicy Pepitas & Brown Butter -- Lightbulb Oven Unfortunately, this was served too cold, but was quite tasty and fresh. Good ingredients. Course #4 (Soup): Slow Roasted Red Pepper w/ Dungeoness Crab -- Homeslice West Served cold, but delicious fusion of pepper and crab flavors. Course #5 (Fish): Seared Striped Bass over Spinach Ball w/ Parnsip Puree -- Ghetto Gourmet Great fish course. Bass seared perfectly and complementary flavors. Course #6 (Sorbet): Cranberry Citrus w/ Apple & Celery Gelee -- Studiofeast Course #7 (Pork): Buta No Kakuni / Japanes Pork Belly w/ Napa Cabbage & Pickled Daikon -- Studiofeast A bit too fatty, but very tender and tasty. Unfortunately, it was served too cold. Course #8 (Poultry): Turducken Roulade w/ Oyster Andouille Stuffing -- Homeslice West My first ever taste of Turducken, and while it was too cold to do it justice, I thought it would have more flavor to it than it did. It was already midnight at this point! Course #9 (Salad): Arugula, Roasted Cranberry & Cornbread Crouton w. Blue Cheese Vinaigrette -- Lightbulb Oven Salad was pretty good...especially like the cornbread crouton. Course # 10 (Beef): Beer Braised Brisket w/ Southern Style Grits -- Homeslice West & Lightbulb Oven This one took me back to my southern roots. Great braised brisket and loved the grits. Course #11 (Cheese): French Double Cream Brie, Cow's Milk, Boorenkaaf Raw Cow's Milk, Aged Gouda, British Stilton -- Ghetto Gourmet Course #12 (Dessert): Dark Chocolate Pistachio Linzer Torte -- Whisk & Ladle Wine Pairings -- Brooklyn Oenology (sources grapes from North Fork). The wine was flowing freely. First 6 courses -- 2007 Social Club White & 2006 Social Club Red Next 6 courses -- 2007 Chardonnay or 2006 Motley Cru We also brought our own wine from Shinn Estate Vineyards in the North Fork.

Sound redundant? I thought so too until I realized there actually is a wine producer that calls itself 'Recession Wines.' Apparently, they are offering 2 Recession Reds, a Cabernet Sauvignon and a Merlot, and 1 Recession White Chardonnay. The best part by far is their promotional video featuring Recession Wines' spokesperson Poris Hilton. You gotta see this for yourself. Lets hope their wines have better taste than their advertising. Some stores in Manhattan that sell Recession Red and Recession White: Warehouse W&S, 67 W&S, Gotham Wines, 86th St. W&S, and McAdam/BuyRite in Murray Hill.

Undergrounds Unite: Secret Dinner Clubs Join Forces for NYC Event

***CONTENT
Over the past couple of years, we've been hearing alot about super-secretive supper clubs that have been popping up around the city (like NY Bite Club) which hold multi-course tasting dinners semi-regularly in private lofts and apartments around town. This weekend five of these underground supper clubs will be joining forces for a massive, 150-seat communal dinner in an undisclosed midtown loft. Somehow Jill was able to score us 2 seats by sending an email them through their website for a password. The so-called \"Undergrounds Unite\" shindig will feature a 12-course meal, with each dinner club handling three courses each. We just got the email disclosing the secret location and how things will work this morning. More on the participating, 'not-so-secret anymore' dinner clubs after the jump... homeslice west is a \"culinary speakeasy\" with a new southern feel. Part dinner party, part underground restaurant, at its heart, homeslice west is about bringing people together in an intimate dining environment conducive to conversation and laughter over great food. It's unpretentious, casual southern goodness. Studiofeast is an invitation-only culinary collective that focuses on promoting emerging and undiscovered gastronomic talent. We are a platform for new ideas and frameworks in dining and express our selves through the Studiofeast and studiofeast | presents feasts. But above all, we're firmly rooted in the spirit of fun and the pursuit of the good life. The Whisk & Ladle In the far reaches of Manhattan's Inwood neighborhood, one woman (with a little help) founded a supperclub that seemed to stand up against the onslaught of the \"bar-restaurant\" culture. Abiding by the traditional structure of the dinner party and out of the deeply entrenched belief that all things civilized and debaucherous find common ground on a dining room table, the Whisk & Ladle supperclub was born. The Ghetto Gourmet was one of the original underground dining pioneers, beginning in early 2004 as a Monday night \"pirate restaurant\" in a basement apartment in Oakland, CA. As a \"wandering supperclub,\" the Ghet produced over 350 community dining events from coast to coast last year. Today, they've expanded to become a \"dinner party network\" where adventurous foodies connect, share info and eventually dine together. Light-Bulb Oven Light-Bulb Oven is a Brooklyn-based culinary salon in operation since February 2007. Powered by seasonal ingredients, lively guests and more than a little irreverence, Light-Bulb Oven is a place for adventurous eaters to try new flavors, make new friends and generally have a good time.

We picked up a bottle of this Wine Spectator 90-pointer from our local wine shop last night to pair with our homemade Top Chef dinner. We had no idea at the time this under $12 riesling had just received mention in the Nov. 15th issue of Wine Spectator as a great value buy, but we can see why. It had really nice floral and apricot flavors and aromas and is a perfect fall weather wine. We would recommend pairing with asian food, mexican food, indian food and it would also be a nice wine for Thanksgiving dinner. Click here to find it in your neck of the woods.

Ready for a 'culinary boner'? Our favorite tv show starts up again tonight on Bravo at 10pm. Needless to say, we're pretty psyched. We'll be keeping with tradition from last season and preparing a home-cooked meal beforehand to enjoy while we watch the show...and what's a Top Chef premiere without a recession special value wine. On tonight's menu is Tabla tikka-marinated chicken breasts on the grill, caramelized broccoli with garlic, and one of Jill's famous salads. As for the wine, we will be trying a value riesling, which we heard pairs nicely with spicy Indian food. We'll let you know which one we try and how it is. For those of you without cable, you can watch with Colicchio himself, who will be hanging out and eating dinner in the lounge at his Craftsteak during the show's airing. Craftsteak is extending their bar menu ’til 11, when it ends. We've been hearing some good things about the $15 and under bar menu, from the burger, with its layer of balsamic onions, to some of the best smoked chicken wings in town.

Recession Wines: Extreme Times Call for Extreme Values

With the worldwide financial crisis in full swing, it’s a time when a lot of wine lovers will be looking to dial back their wine budgets. From people we've spoken to and articles we've read, it seems that most are still drinking the same amount of wine, but less expensive selections. With that in mind, we've decided to launch a new feature called “Recession Wines.” More on \"recession wines\" and a couple of Thanksgiving extreme value picks after the jump... Extreme value wine doesn’t always mean cheap wine, so we will explore the most extreme values in all price categories. We're talking about the $10-20 wines that give $30-40 wines a run for their money. Also, we'll take note of those $30 wines that make you shake your head and wonder what others are charging $75-$100 a bottle for something similar. And even wines you can buy for 8 bucks or less...and we're not talking Two Buck Chuck or Boone's. Now that the days of summer are gone we are shifting gears from the great value sauvignon blancs, rosés and lambruscos to the Austrian grüner veltliner, spicy malbecs, carmeneres, dry and semi-dry rieslings, gewürztraminers and sparkling wines. Here are two (one red and one white) extreme value, food friendly wines that we think will go well with not only the turkey (the easiest part of the pairing since so many wines pair well with turkey) but also with the myriad of seasonal side dishes that make an appearance at the turkey or trudunken dinner. 2004 Bodegas Montecillo Rioja Crianza ($7-$12) While pinot noir is the typical go-to Thanksgiving red (especially Jill's favorites from Burgundy), we've found Tempranillos to work nicely, too. The nice thing about tempranillos is that so many quality ones are available at great value prices. This happens to be one such great bargain tempranillo. There are aromas of roasted herbs and spicy berries, and nice, high-toned red fruit. Nice acidity and balanced tannins make for a long, juicy aftertaste. Click here to find it in your local area. Chateau Ste. Michelle Riesling 2006 (Columbia Valley; $10) 2006 seemed to be a pretty good year for the Washington wine area. This great-value Riesling in a slightly off-dry style, with a nice balance of acidity. White peaches, honeysuckle, and a pretty minerality. Click here to find it in your local area. Stay tuned as we search the wine world for bottles that you would guess are up to 5-10 times more expensive than they really are.

Budget Brunch at Arcane: Low Expectations but Impressive Results

***CONTENT
We should have known better- arriving at the Sunburnt Cow at prime brunch time on a Sunday... What were we thinking? After learning of the over 1 1/2 hour wait to partake in the biggest Sunday Funday all-you-can-drink brunches/parties in town, we decided to go elsewhere. We were intrigued by the french/chill/islandy music and the very budget friendly brunch menu at Arcane, a French-Caribbean restaurant at 111 Ave. C between 7th and 8th Street, so we decided to take a risk and give it a try. Arcane's vibe, music, and lack of an hour (or longer) wait beckoned us inside. The waiters and the bartender were incredibly friendly- all with strong French accents, trendy East Village garb, and big smiles. We were sat immediately underneath a colorful (mobile-like) hanging of voodoo dolls. The space had nice modern lighting, tropical plants, lighted candles, and a big wooden bar. The music was great and almost had Andy rocking out on the air bongo. Our waiter was sure to close the door so we were not cold at our table by the entrance- without us even asking. More about our low expectations-high results brunch after the jump... The menu featured brunch items all around $10 that came with a brunch cocktail + coffee or tea. It was cash only and we certainly had to ask what some dishes were (remember, French-Caribbean brunch). I had the omelet of the day (swiss cheese and mushrooms accompanied by flavorful potatoes and a little salad with mustard vinaigrette). Andy had the baked eggs (a casserole dish filled with baked eggs, a zucchini-like vegetable, ham) which he loved. I was amazed at how good my simple omelet was- fresh herbs, marinated mushrooms, and a healthy portion of hot, melted cheese. It certainly exceeded my expectations. I also was impressed by the \"rasberrini\" brunch cocktail (champagne with raspberry puree), and the mango version of the champagne cocktail was also tropical and delicious. Andy had a bloody mary, but asked for hot sauce to kick it up a notch. He was given traditional tabasco, but also a home-made hot sauce that beat any bottled sauce I ever tried. It had serious heat and was made from yellow peppers (it looked like a yellow pepper relish, but it surely was more spicy than sweet). I had to devour a couple of pieces of the steaming hot french bread after a fork full of the hot sauce. Even though Arcane is not an all-you-can-drink brunch spot (drawing a packed house like Sunburt Cow), you could make your own boozy brunch at Arcane for a very reasonable price. My under $10 omelet included one brunch cocktail and all additional cocktails were only $4. We were so impressed with Arcane's food that we asked to see a dinner menu. We will certainly be back for the conch stew (reminding us of our days in Turks & Caicos) and the jasmine rice. I love a taste of the islands as the New York brisk fall/winter weather sets in, so I am very much looking forward to my next meal at Arcane.

Beer Bar/Gastropub: Waterfront Ale House

***CONTENT
Before there was the Spotted Pig and before the rise of the gastropub, there was Waterfront Ale House. You would never guess from the outside that this Murray Hill saloon (there's a second location in Brooklyn's Cobble Hill) serves up some amazing grub. A hand-painted sign on the wall self-depracatingly proclaims this pub to be the \"Home of Warm Beer, Lousy Food and an Ugly Owner.\" But make no mistake about it, the beer is served at the perfect temp, the food is anything but lousy and as far as owner Sam Barbieri's looks go, you can decide for yourself (he's the one on the right holding his famous homemade egg nog). Given its location adjacent to the Kips Bay movie theater, Waterfront Ale House has been a part of our dinner and a movie night routine for some time now. What's not to like about a friendly, neighborhood bar where you can choose among great beers, grab free popcorn from a self-serve popper and order just about anything from a diverse and fairly eccentric comfort and game food menu and know that it's gonna be pretty darn good. The taps are constantly changing and the kitchen features sublime pub fare with many comfort food favorites, including great burgers and award-winning bbq. It's the perfect spot to grab a beer and a bite on a rainy day, which is exactly why we decided to head over there on Sat. afternoon...more of what we love about WAH after the jump... During holiday season, we love the warm cozy atmosphere and the famous house brand 'Serious Egg Nog'. It's so tasty and full of good rum that we usually take a couple of bottles home with us. It is our no. 1 holiday drink. Other signature libations include the homemade granny apple infused vodka and \"painkiller\" rum punch. The specials listed on the blackboards are a menu onto themselves. Don't expect your normal pub fare here with specials like venison stew, bison burgers, exotic soups, duck liver pate and other hard-to-find game meats with a twist. They were even offering a Grilled Caribbean Pork Loin with a Ginger and Guava Glaze when we were there. Owner Sam Barbieri is an avid barbecuer and has several trophies to attest to his prowess. I've had the 'pulled pig' sandwich and it was downright great bbq. There's an assortment of different hot sauces lining the walls and on the table, but none comes close to Sam's famous house brand (available for purchase). Using what tastes like Habanero peppers as a base, this hot sauce achieves the near impossible balance of being both flavorful and as someone on Citysearch puts it \"still boasting a heat that'll blow through the roof of your skull.\" Not to worry, there are plenty of great draft beers to help wash it down and put out the fire. Jill and I couldn't find an open cab yesterday, but we remembered that Tylenol has been running a promotion right across the street from our apartment offering free rides to anywhere in Manhattan in London-styled taxi cabs. We started with a crock of french onion soup. This 4-onion soup with porter, which the bartender told us is the chef's mom's recipe, is delicious. The porter really added a depth to the beef broth, the bread was thick and brown, the onions were soft and tasty, and the cheese was properly melted over the side of the crock with a nice crispy brown coloring. It was also topped with freshly chopped chives and peppers. I started with a Magic Hat Roxy Rolles, a hoppy amber, and Jill with a Maudite, a strong belgian ale from the same brewery as Le Fin Du Monde. I also tried the Dogfish Head Punkin' Ale, one of the better seasonal pumpkin ales I've tried. They also had two warm cask ales, one of which was a Six Points Otis (oatmeal stout). Click here to check out the current beer list. For my lunch, I had the french dip au jus and Jill went with a grilled vegetable focaccia sandwich with fresh mozzarella and sun-dried tomato pesto. People also swear by WAH's burger and some call it the best beer+burger in town (they also have famous waffle-cut fries). Maybe we'll feature it in an upcoming Burger Wars. We look forward to our next dinner+movie night soon...even if the movie isnt' great, we know we won't be let down by dinner at Waterfront Ale House.

Apparently they also have an unlimited mimosas/bloody mary's brunch that we need to check out, too. Read what Zagat says about Philip Marie after the jump... ZAGAT Ratings & Review Food Decor Service Cost 19 17 19 $42 “Every neighborhood deserves” a “convivial” fallback like this West Village New American, whose “pleasing” fare tastes even better amid the “romance” of the downstairs “secret room for two”; “jazz lovers” also note that the “Wednesday evening music is truly a delight.” SHARETHIS.addEntry({ title: \"Recession Special: Free Bottle of Wine @ W.

Babbo Revisited (unfortunately, only figuratively)

***CONTENT
It's been close to a fortnight since we ate at Babbo and I can't stop thinking about the grilled octopus with “borlotti marinati” and spicy limoncello vinaigrette (thanks to Solo for recommending this), the mint 'love letters' pasta with spicy lamb sausage, the papardelle with butter, parmesan and (generously shaved) white truffles, the guinea hen special...even the complimentary amuse bouche chickpea bruschetta was amazing. We were planning to both do the pasta tasting menu, but since it was close to 11pm when we finally got seated, we went with a mini-tasting recommended by our server instead. Pics and descriptions of the meal after the jump... Our sommelier recommended a nice under $100 Barbaresco that she said would match perfectly with our tasting items. Babbo, as Jill can attest, is one of the most difficult NYC restaurants to get a reservation at, especially if you're using a phone. Jill called right at 10am exactly a month ahead of time and patiently waited on hold for more than an hour, and still was only able to get a 10:45pm reservation (past our bedtime). (Disclaimer: these are not our pics...we find it disrupting not only to others but to our own dining experience to whip out a camera and start snappin' photos at a nice restaurant...we just don't want to be \"those people.\" I have to say we even feel a bit uncomfortable and slightly annoying taking photos at bars and casual restaurants.) Here's what Mario Batali had to say when asked by a food blog about Babbo's photography policy: \"Do you mean folks like bloggers? Our photo policy is that we do not allow lights or taking photos of other customers but do not stop joyous foodies clicking an occasional photo of the food on the table with a small camera. If it starts to feel like a photo shoot or they flash more than twice, we ask them to stop for the comfort of other guests. I pose with guests for hundreds of photos a year in the resto.\" Let the food porn, albeit courtesy of some other \"joyous foodies\", begin: The slightly spicy and slightly tangy chickpeas were nicely bathed with balsamic vinegar and spooned over thick toasted bread. Had we not observed a server shaving copious amounts of truffle over this dish for a couple of people dining at the bar, we may not have know to ask about it. So, when it came our turn we were excited to see the same guy come by with the white truffle and proceed to pour shavings over wide hand-cut noodles dressed with butter and a grating of parmigiano reggiano. It was at this point that our dinner reached epic proportions. The noodles were an ideal choice, as their large size seemed to encourage the truffles to spread out nicely and served as a nice canvas to let the truffles strut their stuff. The heat of the pasta added to the aroma and decadent taste of each and every truffle shaving. They split the dish onto two plates for us and we both agreed that it seemed we each got our own full dish. The pappardelle truffle was a hard act to follow, but this pasta recommended by our server did not disappoint. These mint, pea and sausage stuffed raviolis were served hot and proved to be small, explosively flavorful little packets of goodness. The mint filling was a refreshing breath to the pasta and it was different than any pasta dish we’ve ever encountered. He also recommended a Goose Liver Ravioli with Balsamic Vinegar and Brown Butter, but we decided to save that for next time, though it may have to be the time after next time if we can afford Babbo's eight-course truffle tasting menu the next time we go. Finally, we split a special on the menu: a roasted guinea hen, that to our surprise (and joy) was served boneless. By this time, we were in sheer food heaven. Very impressive that Babbo has been able to seemingly only get better with time, while so many other restaurants peak early and then steadily decline. We'll be back, but next time we may opt to sit in the bar area at a more reasonable time of evening.

Burger Wars Part I: Molly's vs. The Smith

***CONTENT
The winner, but which is it? When times get tough, the tough eat burgers and drink beer, or at least we do. We thought it would be fitting to kick off Burger Wars by pitting a couple of wallet-friendly burger + beer deals against one another. The Competitors: I. Molly's Pub & Restaurant: 287 3rd Avenue (22nd & 23rd). Molly's Jumbo 10 ounce pub burger with your choice of cheddar, american, swiss, mozzarella, or blue cheese, served with french fries, potato salad, mashed potatoes, or onion rings (other toppings available for $1). Cost: $11 (+ cost of beer). II. The Smith: 55 3rd Avenue (10th & 11th). The Smith Sunday \"Get a burger and a beer for $12\"- Burger with cheddar cheese, french fries, and your choice of beer. Cost: $12. The final verdict after the jump... The Final Verdict: The unanimous winner of Burger Wars Part I = Molly's. Jill's Winner: Molly's cheeseburger was the clear victor out of these two burgers- it wasn't even close. First of all, let's talk burger... Molly's burger was large, juicy, and perfectly medium rare. It had a charcoal black crispy outside with ridiculously amazing rare and dripping meat inside. The cheese was perfectly melted into the traditional style burger bun (which in turn melted into the burger as the juices flowed at first bite/cut). This is a real burger- forget adding the lettuce, tomatoes, and fixings (although the pickle was a delight- very crisp and sour). I added a bit of ketchup and was in heaven. Definitely the best burger I have had in a while. When you bite into it, expect savory juices to flow all over your hands and plate. You could really taste the meat- no need for heavy seasoning. I ordered the onion rings but had a few of Andy's fries and found both to be top quality and fresh. There are more burger wars to come, but Molly's is one of my early favorites in NYC (and completely underrated). The Smith burger was good and for the price and ambiance, it still gets a thumbs up from me, but it is not even in the same category as the Molly's burger. The Smith burger was a nice size and my cheddar cheeseburger was cooked well. The french fries were thin, crisp, and tasty. The Smith burger came with all the fixings already on it- including what appeared to be a mayo-based special sauce. I would have added all the fixings anyway (for the extra flavor that the Molly's burger didn't need), so I was happy with the pre-assembly. The best part was the amazing beers on draft that came with the $12 burger meal (and a nice size glass). I chose a Blue Point Toasted Lager which complimented my cheeseburger and fries perfectly. I would certainly come back to The Smith (I LOVE their brunch and their dinner menu- the caramelized brussel sprouts are amazing). You really can't go wrong for a $12 tasty burger that comes with a beer from their great draft beer selection, but with Molly's calling my name only 10 blocks north, I think I'll be returning to The Smith when I am in need of something other than a burger fix. Andy's Winner: Also, hands down, the Molly's burger takes the prize. I know it's a bold statement, but this may have been the best NYC burger I've ever had. I think I said \"This is the best burger I've ever had,\" between just about every bite I took. Even the bun was amazing and had perfect grill marks. When my burger first arrived I was a bit disappointed cause I thought it was overcooked. Man was I wrong. This burger was cooked to perfection. It had this perfect char on the outside leading to a perfect juicy medium rare on the inside. I was dying to go back in the kitchen and ask the chef what their secret is. I asked our server and all she offered up is that they add \"a little bit of love\" to every burger. I cannot believe people wait for places like J.G. Mellon and Shake Shack and probably haven't even heard of the Molly's burger. Molly's is a true Irish bar...sawdust on the floor, Murphy's on tap and Irish tunes on the jukebox. I had to request they put American football on the TV. They agreed, but only for the Notre Dame game. I kinda feel bad for The Smith that it had to face such stiff competition. Their burger was cooked perfectly medium rare and I got to wash it down with a Sixpoint Bengali IPA (all for only $12). I just found the condiments to be overly invasive with the default inclusion of the special sauce (think Big Mac) and that they keep this burger from reaching its full potential. I also found the bun to be a bit too \"bready.\" Just never got that nirvana moment of \"Wow, I'm eating something special here,\" like I did with the Molly's burger. On a 100-point scale, I'd give the Molly's burger a 98 and I'd give The Smith's burger an 89. I'll be back for the $12 burger + beer special, but when friends come to town and want to try one of NYC's best burgers, we're headin' to Molly's. .gallery { margin: auto; } .gallery-item { float: left; margin-top: 10px; text-align: center; width: 33%; } .gallery img { border: 2px solid #cfcfcf; } .gallery-caption { margin-left: 0; } Molly's The Smith Menu at Molly's Burger + Beer Special The Smith burger Molly's Andy in Burger Nirvana Sixpoint Bengali IPA & Blue Point Toasted Head @ The Smith Molly's SHARETHIS.addEntry({ title: \"Burger Wars Part I: Molly's vs. The Smith\", url: \"http://www.winedanddined.com/2008/11/mollys-pub-new-york-the-smith/\" });

The best part about Molly's is that it is perennially left off NY Magazine's best burger issue. I'd expect it to win out over many others. Look forward to coming back to see where and what you're up to next. And, if you need a tag-along for a Financial District contest (http://burgershoppenyc.com/), I'm to the task... Be well, you two.

Burgers are all the rage in NYC and have been for quite some time now. There's a burger for just about every taste and budget. You can spend anywhere between a buck and $175 for a patty in this city. I thought that DB Bistro's foie gras burger was the most expensive, but at a mere 32 bucks (n.b. during fresh truffle season, you can add 10 grams of truffles for $75 or 20 grams for $150), it's cheap compared to Wall Street Burger Shoppe's $175 \"Richard Nouveau\" burger consisting of 10 ounces of Kobe-raised beef crowned with a thick “lobe” of seared foie gras, 25 grams of shaved black truffles, and aged gruyere cheese. I'm guessing they haven't been flippin' too many of these bad boys over the past couple of months. What \"Burger Wars\" is after the jump... Neither of these even come close to Vegas' most expensive burger -- the \"Fleurburger 5000\" (you guessed it, the 5000 means doneros) at the Fleur de Lys restaurant in Las Vegas at Mandalay Bay. You wash this burger down with its own beverage as it comes with a bottle of 1990 Chateau Petrus served in Ichendorf Brunello stemware that you get to keep. While we're not gonna be trying any of those burgers anytime soon, we are gonna be tryin' lots of burgers around the city. Everyone has a different opinion on NYC's best burger...for some it's old standbys like J.G. Mellon, P.J. Clarke's or Corner Bistro, for others it's Burger Joint at Le Parker Meridien or Shake Shack. Lately, we've been hearing alot about this amazing burger in Brooklyn from a small, cozy place called DuMont (Zagat 2008 Best Burger). Even Jill and I don't agree on our favorite burgers. There are also tons of places making awesome patties that go unnoticed. For example, would you ever think that Michael Jordan's in Grand Central makes a great burger, or that a polish 24/7 diner in the e. village is known for its burger, or have you heard about the burger at Molly's, or ever foregone the bbq at Blue Smoke and ordered the burger instead? We've decided to have a little NYC burger-off. We're going to try and compare burgers head-to-head from different places across different categories; under-the-radar burgers, pub burgers, bang-for-your buck burgers, brooklyn burgers, steakhouse burgers (Luger's vs. Smith & Wollensky), diner burgers, brunch burgers, 'damn it feels good to be a burgah' burgers...you get the idea. Stay tuned...all this burger talk has me jonesing a big medium-rare beauty. We may have to get things started this weekend.

Sadly, I don't think I'll make the festival, but be sure to try the Bear Republic Racer 5. It will not disappoint.

Finger Lakes Weekend: Our Wine Tour of the Keuka Wine Trail

Although we were hoping for a beautiful Saturday on Keuka Lake, we awoke in our barn suite to an overcast sky and some slight rain. It was a bit of a challenge to tear ourselves up from our warm king size sleigh bed and to make it to our 9 a.m. breakfast, but when we were served our homemade spinach and white cheese egg souffle with fresh fruit, organic sausage, and piping hot biscuits, it was well worth it. The juice was freshly squeezed and the coffee was tasty and strong. Thankfully, we did not mind the rain because we had booked a driver for the day so we could enjoy our wine tour without worrying about directions and without worrying about tasting too many wines while driving. Our driver, Ron, arrived early and we were off before 11 a.m. to start the tour. Ron was full of knowledge and gave us insight into the development of the region, the growing Amish farm community, the rising real estate prices of lakefront property, and most importantly the layout and reputation of the wineries. We were having such an amazing day visiting the wineries (and tasting all the fabulous rieslings and gewurztraminers), we decided to forgo lunch to make it to even more wineries before returning to the Inn at 5 p.m. Who needs lunch when you have local cheeses and crackers and when there are wine biscuits at every tasting table? More of our winery tour and some pics after the jump... By the end of the day, the rain subsided and we were treated to a spectacular full arch rainbow over Keuka Lake. The fog lifted and the views from the last couple of wineries were spectacular. Ron was the perfect tour guide and told us not to worry if our tour ran over our allotted 6 hours. The drives from winery to winery took us along lakefront roads and we were surrounded by the bright reds, oranges, yellows, and greens of the spectacular fall foliage. All in all, we learned a tremendous amount about a wine region close to home, made some new friends, and tried some great wines. Hunt Country Vineyards: Hunt Country was our first stop of the day. Although there seemed to be some tour buses outside, we were pleasantly surprised to walk right in and up to the tasting bar without a wait. Alice guided us through our tasting ($2 per person for any 5 wines, fully refundable with the purchase of any wine). Although we were supposed to taste 5, Alice poured us many more. The highlight of the tasting for me was the 2007 Late Harvest Vignoles (superb). The noble rot silky sweetness brought me back to Sauternais region of Bordeaux. I surprisingly found the dry riesling lacking in flavor and overly acidic, especially because I generally prefer dry whites. The semi-dry riesling turned out to be worlds more pleasurable. I did not find any of the reds compelling, but we were surprised by a taste of 2002 cabernet franc (the winery had bought back some cases, so we were offered a taste although it was not on the tasting menu). The winery had a nice little gift shop and also sold handmade ravioli from The Ravioli Shop, a small Rochester ravioli producer. We had just finished breakfast at the Inn so food was not on our mind, but if it was later in the day I'm sure we would have snagged some of the seasonal pumpkin ravioli for Sunday night dinner. Being our first stop of the day, it was hard to rate the Hunt Country wines at first but after visiting the other wineries, I would certainly recommend Hunt Country if you are in the Keuka Lake region. Dr. Konstantin Frank Vinifera Wine Cellars: Andy and I had heard the most about Dr. Frank's wines and understood that they were the highest quality wines in the region, so we were very much looking forward to this stop. We were escorted around the porch (with a beautiful lakefront view) to the second tasting room with about 12 other people as soon as we arrived. There was no tasting fee and our affable tasting guide, Susan, presented two wines to select from each time she poured. It worked out perfectly for us, because we would get one of each and compare. I found the sparkling wines (that they listed as champagne causing me to cringe- being a Francophile myself) to exceed my expectations. Both the Frank Brut and Celebre Rose were lovely and were made with traditional old world methods. The whites were quite nice, but the highlight of the tasting was being introduced to some varietals I had never tried (and never even heard of). The Cuvee d'Amour (the vitus Amurensis varietal from Siberia and northern China), the Lemberger (light style red from Central Europe) and the Rkatsiteli (a hugely popular varietal in Eastern Europe-a white with crisp acidity) were all new to me. It was so exciting to experiment with tasting and comparing some new reds and our guide continued to pour for us after the rest of the tasting group dismantled. We ended up spending much more time at Dr. Frank's than expected. It was one of our favorite visits of the weekend. Heron Hill: Our next stop was Heron Hill. The setting was once again beautiful and the tasting room was unique as it was modeled to resemble the inside of a wine barrel. All of the Heron Hill employees were dressed up in '20s attire and there was nice acoustic guitar music making the tasting room a very festive spot. We decided to taste from the premium menu (at $5 per person), but were surprisingly not impressed with the premium estate whites. I also was not a huge fan of the premium cabernet franc I chose to taste, but both Andy and I loved the late harvest rieseling. There was a smooth honey flavor but also some layers of orange peel and light acidity. Heron Hill had a great gift shop and were able to stock up on the essentials (new foil cutters, stoppers, and cheese boards). Bully Hill Vineyard: We had commented that it would be nice to be in a wine region where the tasting rooms were not overrun with drunken groups of men and women pounding wines for a bachelor or bachelorette party. Boy were we wrong. When we walked into Bully Hill, we walked right into one big frat party. The room was full of groups of men and women celebrating god knows what with underwear on the outside of their pants and giant hot dog and hamburger hats on (not kidding). After being polite and signing the briefs on the outside of some stranger's jeans with a sharpie marker, we began our tasting. Jason, our guide, told us when to sip, told us when to chug, and told us when to cheer. The goal seemed to get everyone drunk so they wouldn't notice what they were drinking. Although the wines were not top quality (some were down right awful- think concord grape juice), the atmosphere was entertaining, and the labels on the bottles were quite artistic. It was a fun stop, but we could not bring ourselves to finish our glasses (of horrendous sugary grape juice) when ordered to do so by our tie-died and mardi gras-bead-clad director of ceremonies, so we ran. Ravines Wine Cellar: The next visit took us to the Eastern side of Lake Keuka to a boutique winery run by Morton and Lisa Hallgren. What sets Ravines Wine Cellar apart from the rest is first of all, the Hallgren's only bought the land in 2000 so it is quite a young operation. Secondly (and I was very excited about this), the winery is run by a French winemaker using Old World winemaking techniques. Morton Hallgren was born in the South of France in Provence where his family owns Domaine de Castel Roubine. Morton studied at the Ecole Nationale Superiure d'Agronomie in Montpellier and even spent a harvest at Chateau Cos D'Estournel (which we passed while in Bordeaux and from which we have bought a lot of wine). From there, Morton worked in Texas, at the Biltmore Estate in NC, and at Dr. Frank's winery as the chief winemaker. The tasting room was a bit packed by the time we got there but thankfully we left the underwear-clad, goggle-wearing, wine-chugging group behind at Bully Hill. We were pleasantly surprised by the quality of Ravines wines and especially enjoyed the whites (try the dry riesling, gewurtz, and sauvignon blanc). We had high expectations for the Meritage (hoping for a nice old world Bordeaux blend), but it did not blow us away. Definitely a step up from Bully Hill and one of the more consistent tastings we had but not our favorite of the day. Rooster Hill Vineyards: Next stop, winery number six. Okay, by now I am forgetting to jot down my tasting notes so not too sure how exact I can be on the wine descriptions. Rooster Hill was a very inviting, friendly place (think large red barn with an impressive amount of rooster paraphernalia- both to admire and to purchase). Although none of what we tasted was remarkable, we found the 2007 Silver Pencil to be quite pleasant. It is surely a good buy table wine and it is slightly sweet with some exotic fruit overtones. I would not pair it with your special grilled branzini with olive, capers, and preserved lemon emulsion, but I would certainly pop it open with the barbecue shrimp kebabs or the summer picnic tuna salad sandwich. We did find ourselves some lovely locally crafted chardonnay strawberry cheese and pepper dusted crackers to take back to the Inn (our stomachs were beginning to growl by now). Keuka Spring Vineyard: Our last stop of our quite long day of tasting was Keuka Spring Vineyard. By now, the fog had lifted and we were treated to spectacular views of the lake. We tried some different whites (I believe we tasted their pinot gris and seyval blanc- but once again, my note taking skills were not at their finest by now). I did very much enjoy their gewurtz and their late harvest vignoles. We also found ourselves some wine-related regional crafts (envision our wine bottles at home now clad with hand carved hanging black beers and moose- now remember how much wine we had before making these purchases). The tasting room had a rustic feel and a beautiful lake view. It was the perfect ending to our day in the country along the Keuka Wine Trail. .gallery { margin: auto; } .gallery-item { float: left; margin-top: 10px; text-align: center; width: 33%; } .gallery img { border: 2px solid #cfcfcf; } .gallery-caption { margin-left: 0; } View of Keuka Lake Alice at Hunt Country Tasting Group at Dr. Frank Drinkin' in the Rain (Heron Hill) Heron Hill Grand Tasting Room 20's Costumes at Heron Hill Frat Party at Bully Hill Is that Jill signing someone's briefs?

Hi Susan here - your taster from Dr. Franks - thanks for your kind words - glad you enjoyed your time at our winery. You have a a great blog that I will continue to follow. I do have to make a slight correction, Rkatsiteli (I remember one of your favorites) is a white wine. Other than that you are a wonderful advertisement for our winery. Please let us know when you'll be back in the Finger Lakes! Cheers ~

We had an amazing time On Sunday on our way back to NYC we decided to hit up some of the wineries on Seneca Lake. We went to Fox Run Vineyards, which I had been wanting to check out after reading of their 2008 Winery of the Year achievement from Wines & Spirits magazine. It may have been because they weren't pouring some of their more highly acclaimed wines, but Jill and I weren't that impressed. Almost everyone we met at our Inn and around the Finger Lakes said we had to visit Hermann J. Wiemer vineyard. We loved our visit here. Great rieslings and we left with a few bottles. We also stopped in and tasted wines at Belhurst Castle. Though we like to stay at small b&b's, we would definitely stay here for a future visit. Thanks for all your great recommendations.

Although we had planned on dinner Saturday night at Warfield's restaurant after our inn keeper told us about a special tasting menu we could try from her friend there, the award-winning chef, we decided on a last minute switch and ended up at The Brown Hound Bistro in Naples, New York. After a long day of tasting (and after popping open another bottle of white with some strawberry cheese and crackers by the fire back at the Inn), we thought driving 3 miles rather than over 30 would be a much better option. We had heard how excellent The Brown Hound Bistro was, but we also heard that with only a handful of tables we may not be able to get in. Thankfully, a couple had cancelled their reservation and we were told to come right over. More on our amazing meal after the jump... After driving only a couple of miles on a deserted Route 64, Andy and I thought our navigation system must have had one too many glasses of wine itself. How could a renowned restaurant be 0.5... 0.4... 0.3... 0.2... miles away in the middle of nowhere? As we got closer, we thought we must have entered the address incorrectly, but then there it was. A little white house with a picket fence emanating a warm, inviting light. We climbed up the stairs of the porch and were amazed by the tiny (but lively) little bar and the tiny little dining room. We were seated immediately and after a quick review of the menu, we knew we made the right choice. After being spoiled by such amazing meals over the past week, Brown Hound Bistro still managed to impress us. We picked our favorite local wines from the day's tastings and we relaxed to the live guitar music in the dining room while looking forward to a relaxing night in our barn suite. I started off with a crisp Caesar salad (salad was much needed after a week of indulgence) while Andy had an unbelievable crock of french onion soup. The most impressive part of the evening was the special I ordered- perfectly medium rare Beef Wellington. The light savory pastry melted into the perfectly tender meat and the fall roasted vegetables and creamy mashed potatoes were godly. It surely beat my One if By Land, Two if By Sea signature Beef Wellington- I could not have been happier. Andy chose the filet with smoked gouda and chived whipped potatoes and petit noir thyme jus- perfection! How did they do it? With friendly service, local wines, and amazing food (and only a couple of miles from our Finger Lakes home), we could not have done better. We finished up the night with some late harvest reisling and a steaming apple crisp. The Brown Hound Bistro, our little cozy oasis in the Finger Lakes, was the perfect escape from everything urban.

Finger Lakes Weekend: Fri Night Dinner @ The Bistro at Red Newt Cellars

Though we had planned to leave the city early Friday morning, we got off to a late start because of work...guess we can't really complain though since it supports our wine habit. The late start meant an hour to get through the Lincoln Tunnel and an additional hour and a half of Jersey traffic after that. I was nervous we weren't going to make it in time for our 8:30pm dinner reservation at Red Newt Bistro. Thanks to some fast drivin' (courtesy of our Hertz rental car) and some impressive bladder control, we made near record time and cut down a five and a half hour drive to about four hours and fifteen minutes. We first heard about Red Newt Cellars on Lenndevours, a wine blog that has become our primary source for info on the North Fork wine region and that has added Finger Lakes correspondents to keep readers up to speed with the goings on of that region, too. We were intrigued after reading a post about Deb Whiting, the executive chef and co-owner of Red Newt Cellars, and decided to make a reservation. Our dinner experience at Red Newt Bistro after the jump... We were famished by the time we arrived at Red Newt, located on the eastern side of Seneca Lake, so we didn't waste any time checking out the inventive menu and ordering up some appetizers and, obviously, some wine. Appetizer #1 - House made wheat ravioli filled with sweet potato, dried cranberry, mascarpone and chard in a roasted garlic cream sauce topped with parmesan and toasted walnuts Appetizer #2 - Bruschetta with fresh mozzarella, free range bacon, roasted red peppers, spinach and chipotle pesto Our friendly server explained to us how Chef Whiting uses only locally-produced food and that she has a particular place in her culinary heart for local goat cheeses. Our server also recommended the Roasted Pumpkin Hummus and the Grilled Bacon-Wrapped Scallops on Potato Leek Pancake, leaving us with a pretty difficult decision. The wheat ravioli appetizer, while it could have been served a bit warmer, had a delicious flavor and texture combination. It made for an ideal Autumn starter dish with the dried cranberry, sweet potatoes and toasted almonds giving it both sweet and savory elements. The bruschetta was served hot and it was amazing. Granted I'm a bit biased given my soft spot for bacon, but this appetizer was kickin' with the chipotle pesto adding a nice spicy element. As far as wines go, while Deb runs the kitchen, it is her husband Dave who is in charge of the wine-making process. Red Newt produces one of the few Sauvignon Blanc wines in the Finger Lakes. After all this region is known primarily for its rieslings. Jill went with the 2006 Sauvignon Blanc Reserve while I tried a flight of three 2005 Red Newt Reds (cabernet franc, merlot and cabernet sauvignon). Jill enjoyed her sauvignon blanc but missed the crisp, citrus well-balanced summer taste of the Marlborough sauvignon blanc's. I tasted some fairly big fruit and some acidity on the front of the palate of her wine. Definitely a different style than the New Zealand and Chilean new world sauvignon blanc's we've grown accustomed to, but very good nonetheless. I enjoyed all 3 of the reds I tasted. My favorite was the Cab Franc which had a bright crimson color and light tannins that I could feel the tinge of in my cheeks. I have to say I was pretty impressed with Red Newt's wines. With the local cornucopia of pumpkin, cabbage, winter squash, apples and pears, we were not surprised to see these as ingredients in several of the dinner entrée options. Jill went with the lamb chops special while I had the roasted free range pork chop stuffed with apples, pork sausage, chevre and chard with an apple riesling sauce, served with roasted garlic and sage smashed sweet potatoes and seasonal vegetables. Both of our entrées were great, though my knife was not quite sharp enough for my pork chop, i.e. pork chop was euphemistically a tad overcooked. I had an awesome glass of riesling to go with my big, stuffed chop. The 2006 Tierce Dry Riesling is a collaboration of three of Seneca Lake's top wine producers -- Fox Run (we visited on Sunday and will tell you about soon), Anthony Road and Red Newt. Not a bad way to be introduced to my first riesling of the weekend. Tons of floral notes and citrus popped on my palate. We had a great dinner at Red Newt Bistro and would recommend it to anyone traveling to the Finger Lakes. Unfortunately, we couldn't stay for a nightcap since we still had about an hour's drive to our B&B and it was already 10:15pm. .gallery { margin: auto; } .gallery-item { float: left; margin-top: 10px; text-align: center; width: 33%; } .gallery img { border: 2px solid #cfcfcf; } .gallery-caption { margin-left: 0; } My flight of 2005 reds Jill enjoying some 2006 Red Newt Sauvignon Blanc My stuffed pork chop Jill's lamb chops Havin' a good time at Red Newt SHARETHIS.addEntry({ title: \"Finger Lakes Weekend: Fri Night Dinner @ The Bistro at Red Newt Cellars\", url: \"http://www.winedanddined.com/2008/10/finger-lakes-weekend-fri-night-dinner-the-bistro-at-red-newt-cellars/\" });

We have so much to report on our amazing weekend away to the Finger Lakes region of New York. Work's got us a both a bit tied up at the moment, but we can't wait to describe and show you some photos of our indulgent and educational weekend. We hit up some fantastic (and some quite unique) wineries...10 of 'em in 2 days. We met tons of nice people...and some very drunk ones. We imbibed large quantities of riesling and cabernet franc and even got introduced to a couple of new grapes we had never heard of. We stayed at a lovely and romantic B&B. We had fantastic meals. And we saw lots of beautiful fall foliage. More coming soon...

We had an amazing dinner last night at Babbo. Actually, it was friggin' decadently delicious. Can't do it justice right now (we're scrambling to finish up some work so we can get out of the city and on our way to the Finger Lakes). It was the second best meal I've had in NYC...actually make that in my life. Ok maybe third best in my life. In fact, I'm adding a \"Best Meals of Our Life\" category to Wined & Dined. First - hands down was Per Se. Second - Pierre Gagnaire in Paris (#3 on World's 50 Best Restaurants List behind El Bulli and The Fat Duck - Per Se is #6) I'll describe Pierre Gagnaire experience in a future post. Our meals at Blue Hill at Stone Barns rank up there, too. These are the type of life-altering meals that make it hard to go anywhere else for a few weeks. It's kind of like committing culinary suicide. I dug up an email Jill sent me a year ago to the day that sums up pretty nicely our experience at Per Se last year (she should write for Zagat). Check it out after the jump... From: Janeczko, Jill To: Freedman, Andrew M. Sent: Wed 10/24/2007 10:16 AM Subject: I can't stop.... thinking about what we ate. The best meal of my life. Hands down. No comparison. I've been raving about it to everyone. I am dreaming about the white truffles with the buttery perfectly cooked pasta. I don't think I'll ever forget that taste or the image of a massive truffle from a gleaming polished box being shaved so there was triple the amount of truffle than pasta! I am imagining the salmon tartar sesame cone with crème fraiche, the little cheese thingies, the salts from around the world and Brooklyn brewery and Riesling infused breads, the salted butter that came from the same 8 cows that made your ricotta with eggplant and marinara sauce, the puree romaine soup with perfectly bite sized fingerling potatoes and a drop of truffle infused crème fraiche, the caviar and pearl oysters in cream with rose champagne, the hollowed out egg shell with buttery truffle custard and rosemary potato chip, the butter poached lobster with vegetables, the beef of which only 4 slices comes out of a whole cow cooked to perfection- most flavorful beef I have ever eaten, the sablefish with the little chorizo and pepper pieces, the quail roasted to perfection with my sweetbreads (still can't believe I ate sweetbreads), the foie gras with my perfectly cooked succulent piece with caramelized pearl onions and your PB&J with a never ending supply of fresh brioche- I loved your quote on that one, the sea bass (of which you ate both our skins), the pomegranate sorbet cleanser with graham cracker and sour cherries, the cheeses with pear and cranberry brioche, the chocolate dessert with the buttermilk ice cream, the sour cranberry cobbler with my creamy sorbet, the coffee custard and your cinnamon birthday doughnut, then they even brought us more with a perfectly cooked crème brule and I don't even know what sort of custardy fruit spectacular you got! Incredible. Best dinner ever! SHARETHIS.addEntry({ title: \"Babbo-licious\", url: \"http://www.winedanddined.com/2008/10/babbo-licious/\" });

New Beer Bar: Rattle 'N' Hum Made us Very 'Hoppy'

Maybe our blog would be more aptly named 'Wined & Dined & Chugged.' In the past month we hit up the 2nd Annual NYBrewfest at South Street Seaport and then went with our friends Riki, Kristi and Joe to the Mahattan Cask Ale Festival at Chelsea Brewing Co. Where Jill tends to like the Belgian strong ales (I'm convinced she goes straight to the ABV% (alcohol by volume) and orders accordingly), I'm more a hoppy IPA person. Thanks to our friends over at BeerMenus (great site where you can type in the name of any beer and find all the bars in NYC that serve it), we heard about this new beer bar Rattle 'n' Hum that just opened on 33rd b/t 5th and Mad. We went and checked it out this past Sunday. While we love our rowdy football Sunday Fun-Days at a local bar as much as the next person, I have to say it was refreshing to walk into a bar that was just barely crowded for a Sunday afternoon....and served something other than Stella and Bud Light. If you love craft ales and microbrews, this is your place. Their taps are ridiculous...they have just about everything. The bartender was really nice, too. She must have poured us samples of 5 beers each before we ordered our first one. What we drank and the full beer list after the jump... Jill started with a Stone Arrogant Bastard (would have no doubt gone with a Victory Golden Monkey if they had it) and I went with a Great Divide Titan IPA. My Titan IPA had some aggressive hop flavors with a tinge of citrus and finished with a mellow malty sweetness. Before our second beer, we got to try some cask samples and also the seasonal Captain Lawrence Pumpkin Ale. I have to admit I was expecting a bit more from the Captain here after having the amazing Liquid Gold at the Cask Ale Festival. Jill moved on next to a Dogfish Head 90 Minute and I had an Elysian Avatar Jasmine IPA. Mine was really good, but way too floral and fragrant. You can't go wrong with the Dogfish Head 60 or 90 Minute. We tried some apps also but they were nothing to write home (or here) about. I hear we should have had the sliders. I had high hopes for the curry fries, but the curry was more like a thick gravy. We'll definitely be heading back for the sick beer selection, though.

Zagat's getting in on the \"recession special\" action coming up with 5 French restaurants serving up multicourse dinner bargains. The best deal here looks to be Demarchelier (86th b/t Mad and Park) which is offering up 2 courses and a glass of wine for a scant 26 bucks. While the reviews on MenuPages look to be mixed at best, beggars can't be choosers. Click here for 4 more brought-to-you-by-Zagat French specials.

Recession Special: SushiSamba

We hear that SushiSamba is joining the growing list of NYC restaurants offering a lower-priced menu in response to the economic downturn. The $35, three-course menu includes pan-seared sea scallops, kobe beef with ponzu gelee and Japanese mushrooms, and warm chocolate banana cake. It's available for dinner, Sundays through Thursdays. And while several high-end restos are lowering prices to lure budget-minded diners, some notorious NYC cheap eats are having to raise their prices to meet increasing costs. The New York Times reported yesterday that Gray’s Papaya will be raising the price of its famous “recession special” (2 dogs + drink) from $3.50 to $4.45. Pop Burger in midtown just raised the price of 2 pop burgers from $5 to $7. More Recession Specials after the jump... Dennis Foy in Tribeca has introduced a $27 Recession Special. Click here for the menu. Megu has introduced a $55 prix fixe menu in addition to its seven-course $125 tasting menu. Realizing that a $180 nine-ounce Kobe beef Chateaubriand is now beyond the reach of many customers, Megu has started offering an appetizer portion for $35. Jack Bistro, a French-American eatery in Greenwich Village, offered a \"Dow Depression Special\" while the market was crashing the past couple of weeks. Every time the Dow Jones index dropped, they took a corresponding number of cents off the price of their dinner entrees. Thus, when the Dow dropped 100 points, Jack reduced the price of its dishes by $1. The New York Post ran an article last week to help NYC diners save some moolah. The theme was \"If you like so and so expensive restaurant, then you should try so and so less expensive restaurant with similar food.\" Here's a midtown happy hour recession special to report. TG Whitney's (53rd b/t 2nd and 3rd) is offering complimentary wings, chicken tenders and potato skins on the house during happy hour (4pm to 8pm), on the hour, Tuesdays and Wednesdays.

Each year, more than 50,000 spectators converge on the rolling hills of Moorland Farms in Far Hills, NJ, for the states' biggest social event of the fall season -- The Far Hills Race Meeting. The race in 2008 marked the 88th running, and the Far Hills Race features some of the finest steeplechasers in the world competing against a beautiful autumn setting. But it's not the horses that are the real draw here. The Hunt is all about the tailgating. Walking around the infield we saw everything from a 5-foot tall champagne glass, beer pong tables and bean bag tosses to hot spiked ciders, pitchers of bloody mary's, sangrias, mimosas and wines. This day was all about good friends, beer, gourmet food, beautiful fall weather, jumping horses, champagne, betting, wine, more beer, more horses, liquor, and more food. Check out the pics after the jump... .gallery { margin: auto; } .gallery-item { float: left; margin-top: 10px; text-align: center; width: 33%; } .gallery img { border: 2px solid #cfcfcf; } .gallery-caption { margin-left: 0; } Another year, another Hunt Toasting it up What horse do you like, Josh?

Supper in East Village: Only Pay For What You Drink

***DATE

***CONTENT
The East Village is a treasure trove of great restaurants serving up super values. Probably for the better, many of these places have stayed off the Zagat, NYMag and Eater radar screens, leaving the East Village restaurant scene one of the few remaining in the city where you can drop in any number of places off the street without a reservation and have great food and drink for a relative bargain. Our friends Josh and Nicole recently enjoyed a meal at East Village standout Supper. Supper is the sister restaurant of two other East Village value spots, Frank and Lil' Frankie's. Josh will be describing in more detail the unique wine deal and more about why they liked Supper in a comment below. Apparently, what sets Supper apart is its unique wine program, where they charge you by consumption. So you can order a number of bottles and drink from each according to your desire, and then they weigh each bottle at the end and charge you in quarter-bottle increments.

Mollydooker Tasting Mon. Night @ Nick & Stef's

***CONTENT
I was excited to hear last week about a Mollydooker wine tasting at Nick & Stef's restaurant. We came across Mollydooker last year when we bought a bottle from local wine shop Crush. We had the 2006 Mollydooker \"Two Left Feet,\" a blend of Shiraz, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot. At about $20-$25 retail, it's one of the best of the Australian value wines we've tasted. Simply put, this is great juice! Here's what Parker says about it: The 2005 Two left feet is blend put together by Sarah Marquis. It boasts an inky purple color, superb intensity, a big, sweet, full bodied nose of crème de cassis, graphite, white choclate, black olives, blackberry liqueur, anmd spice, and a spectacular, voluptuous, even unctuous texture. This is a big, powerful, classic southern Austrlian red made with no compromises. Drink it over the next 3 years, though I suspect it will last a decade or longer. 94 Points. Robert Parker Jr Wine Advocate #165 Unfortunately, some of the higher end Mollydooker's are just way out of our price range. We've heard all the raves in the wine mags about the award-winning Velvet Glove, but at $250-$300 a bottle retail, it's just not gonna happen. So what better chance to get a taste of wines that fall a bit out of our price range than at a wine tasting event led by the owners and winemakers of Mollydooker, Sarah and Sparky Marquis. For $85 a person, we're getting to taste 10 Mollydooker wines and have a dinner prepared by the executive chef at Nick & Stef's. No offense Nick & Stef's -- but we're a bit more excited for the wine part of this event. This price includes tax and tip. Though it's a bit steep, our typical meal at an NYC steakhouse runs about $200-$300 depending on what bottle we select. Looking for Mollydooker in NYC. Where you can find it after the jump...

The beauty of living and working in midtown is that you can take advantage of so many free wine tastings...even during your lunch hour! I received an email from Sherry-Lehmann today at 12:45pm reminding me of a Cristal tasting event taking place today and tomorrow between 2-4pm with Frédéric Rouzaud, the President & CEO of Champagne Louis Roederer Group. So I high-tailed it over to Sherry-Lehmann at 2:10pm and was back in the office by 2:40pm. During that time, I tasted a generous pour of the 2002 Cristal, had a conversation with Monsieur Rouzaud, met Michael Aaron, the retired Chairman of Sherry-Lehmann, and picked up a sandwich. Not bad for a day's work-lunch. .gallery { margin: auto; } .gallery-item { float: left; margin-top: 10px; text-align: center; width: 33%; } .gallery img { border: 2px solid #cfcfcf; } .gallery-caption { margin-left: 0; } Frédéric Rouzaud Michael Aaron with Frédéric Rouzaud Retails for $260/bottle The scene at the Cristal tasting Frédéric Rouzaud showing his stuff Outside Sherry-Lehmann SHARETHIS.addEntry({ title: \"Free Cristal Tasting Today & Tomorrow: Sherry-Lehmann\", url: \"http://www.winedanddined.com/2008/10/free-cristal-tasting-today-tomorrow-sherry-lehmann/\" });

Napa in New York: Wine Spectator's California Wine Experience

***CONTENT
 Last night we attended the Grand Tasting that kicked off the weekend-long California Wine Experience in NYC. Though it was a hefty price to pay at $250 a pop, it did not disappoint one bit. Perhaps the best feature of this tasting, besides all of the top-scoring wines, is that the owners and winemakers are all on-hand to meet, greet and talk about their wines. There doesn't come a more passionate and friendly group of people than vineyard owners and winemakers. Just about every owner we spoke with (of vineyards both large and small) invited us to come out for a private tour and tasting whenever we happen to be in the area. We were also excited to re-unite with our friends, the Harpers and the Wallaces, from Texas who we met back in June on a 6-day tour of Bordeaux. Like us, they are huge wine nuts and travel to NYC every year for the entire weekend of wine tastings and programs. Their collective wine knowledge is boundless, and we learned as much talking with them as we did from the winemakers. Thanks to our friends we were able to get in to the private tasting held between 6:30-7:30pm before the masses arrived. It was like being a kid in a candy store walking around and seeing the likes of Araujo, Groth, Diamond Creek, Kosta Browne, Paul Hobbs, Far Niente, Harlan, Heitz, Opus One, Pahlmeyer, Kistler, Joseph Phelps and the list goes on and on. In fact, almost all of the cult cabs were represented minus one -- Screaming Eagle. According to our friends, it was the first year Screaming Eagle has not taken part. It truly was mind-boggling to have the opportunity to taste all of these prestigious California (and some Oregon and Washington) wines, some of which retail for anywhere between $150-$650 a bottle. These are the wines I dream about ordering with my filet at a Del Frisco or Palm, but can't rationalize splurging for, i.e. can't afford. We'll be posting our tasting notes soon, but here are some of the wines we tasted and people we met: D.R. Stephens Estate - Our Texas friends had met the Stephens on a trip to Napa and were invited for a personal tour of the vineyards where they were given the royal treatment. The owners' son and his wife were on-hand. Click here for restaurants in NYC that serve D.R. Stephens wines Araujo Estate -- We tasted a phenomenal cab. Frank Morris in our group referred to it as \"Silver Oak on steroids.\" Merry Edwards -- We are on the Merry Edwards mailing list and were excited to visit them. Known for their outstanding Russian River Valley pinot noirs, they were tasting their 2005 Sauvignon Blanc, which has been getting amazing reviews. The 2005 Sauvignon Blanc was named 40th in Wine Spectator's “Top 100 Wines of 2007.” Merry's husband, Ken, was on-hand (his business card actually reads \"Merry's Husband\"). He is so engaging and has such an unbelievable personality. We loved getting to meet and speak with him. There's so much to be said for getting to know the people behind the wine. Here are some other pics...we will be posting about other wines we tasted and people we met shortly.

First Taste: Obika Take-Out = Euro Trash

***CONTENT
After two unfruitful attempts to try the much-hyped Obika take-out, I finally got my shot today. By the time I arrived, all they had left was a mozzarella and sun-dried tomato piadina (not sure what the difference is between this and a panini, but it's on piadina bread). They heated it up for me and I was off. As an aside, for my $8.67, I was expecting maybe a nice, euro-designed Obika bag to walk back to the office with to put the world on notice of what I had just scored. No such luck. The so-called piadina was wrapped in tin foil and placed in a plain white paper sack. No biggie. It's what's on the inside that counts, right? So on to what matters, the food. I was first struck by how ridiculously small this pia-thingie was. We knew that for only 8 bucks it wasn't going to be a whopper of a panini, but this was a bit absurd. I'll give Obika the benefit of the doubt that after running out of paninis and pia-thingies before 12:30pm two days in a row, they decided to cut them in half to see if they could make it through an entire lunch service. I was next struck by how little there was in this pia-majiggie. Two parts of a sun-dried tomato with a little bit of mozzarella melted on it, a couple of tiny pieces of arugula, and that was all. Lastly, I was struck by how salty it tasted...almost to the point of inedibility. Am I the only one out there with this awful first Obika experience? I would have thrown the rest of it away, but there was no 'rest of it' after 2 bites. I immediately went down to Europa and grabbed a pressata for comparison purposes (and because I was still starved). It was 3 times the size and tasted much better. Three days in, and it's already time for Obika to get their proverbial 'merda' together. .gallery { margin: auto; } .gallery-item { float: left; margin-top: 10px; text-align: center; width: 33%; } .gallery img { border: 2px solid #cfcfcf; } .gallery-caption { margin-left: 0; } Obika Piadina in Reynold's Wrap Is this a joke?

Recession Special: The Dish by AMEX = 20% off meals, but is there a catch?

***CONTENT
These days it seems like everyone has a website that is related in some way or another to the NYC restaurant scene. American Express is now getting in on the action with the launch of The Dish. According to the website, \"The Amercian Express Dish is a community of people who love to dine. It helps you find great restaurants, rave about your favorite spots, save at premium eateries, and discover where people with similar dining habits go for a great meal.\" I decided to sign up to see how The Dish could help fellow, card-carrying NYC \"winers & diners\" save some moolah, or if it was all a gimmick. Here's what I found... After signing up, I clicked through to the \"All Offers\" section of the website to check out some deals. I was surprised to see more than 40 restaurants offering 20-25% discounts...places like Aquavit, Artisanal, Fiamma, Primehouse, The Red Cat, Mai House, 5 Ninth and Cafe des Artistes. I clicked on Primehouse as a test to see what the catch is, and here's the deal. In order to qualify for the 20% discount, you have to book your reservation directly through The Dish website. Easy enough. A calendar shows all available reservations for the next 14 days. For Primehouse, you can only book parties of 1-4 people and the 20% discount is only available for certain reservation times: 2-4pm or 5-6:30pm or 9:30pm-11pm -- important note: reservation times and # of people per party vary by restaurant, with most restaurants being more restrictive with their time slots than Primehouse, i.e. only after 10:30pm certain nights or only available for lunch, as in the case of Il Mulino. The less popular the restaurant, the less restrictive the available discount reservation times. For example, Nick & Stef's steakhouse has reservations available for 8-10pm on weekends. Ok, so there's at least one catch. You can't book highly sought after reservation slots and get the deal. Still, it's not so bad for a Thursday through Saturday night to book a 9:30pm reservation and arrive at 8:45pm or so. In my experience, unless you're at Babbo or Per Se, your table will be ready well before your reservation time. Next, I wondered if there were any other catches to this deal. Will I look like a cheap schmuck to my server when it comes time to pay the tab (I hate using coupons at restaurants)? Do the 20% savings only apply to food and not liquor or wine? Is there a minimum tab amount to qualify for the discount? Do the 20% savings apply to tax and tip? I was pleasantly surprised to learn that the server will likely not even know my party is dining on a 20% coupon, and if they do know through the restaurant's reservations system, they will have comfort that it won't affect their tip. The discount applies to everything (tax, tip and liquor) and there is no minimum tab amount. Only negatives are the restricted reservation times and limited to 4 people or fewer. Here's a description of what AMEX refers to as a \"Statement Credit Offer.\" With statement credit offers the restaurant does not apply the offer to your restaurant bill at time of purchase. Instead, American Express automatically applies the offer as a statement credit to your American Express Card account statement. Here's how it works: Complete your restaurant reservation on New York Dish. Dine at the restaurant at the appointed time. Pay your restaurant bill in full with the American Express Card registered to your American Express Dish account. American Express will apply the offer as a statement credit to your monthly American Express Card account statement. Your savings will be calculated against the full amount (including tax and tip) charged to your American Express Card. Most statement credits will post to your account in 3 - 5 days but please allow up to 60 days for the credit to appear on your American Express Card account statement.

Work Week Lunch: Best Food Cart Salad in Midtown

Halal Cart on 55th b/t Park and Mad Street food vendors are all the rage right now in Midtown. They have cult followings (at least the good ones do) and even have their own Vendy Awards. Thanks to Midtown Lunch, I have discovered quite a few food carts to add to my work week lunch rotation. There's the new taco truck near Bloomies (try the spicy lamb taco -- unreal), the Biriyani cart with their roti rolls, the famous 53rd and 6th Halal cart, all the dessert trucks, and many more. One problem is that it's difficult to eat healthy when picking up lunch from a street vendor. These guys aren't exactly catering to a Jenny Craig audience. Healthy-minded food cart fans, look no further. The Halal Cart on 55th b/t Park and Mad serves up a Greek Salad with Grilled Chicken (either spicy or regular) that I will put up against any salad from Chop't, Cosi, Just Salad, Europa, Lite Bites, City Market, you name it. The salad ingredients are fresh, the feta is great and the chicken is grilled as you order. Not to mention, there are 2 quality salad dressing options -- a balsamic vinaigrette and a caesar. All for 6 bucks. If you know of any other food carts serving up salads like this one, let me know.

According to Eater's walkthrough and photo tour of the new Shake Shack UWS, a wine list is in the offing...and after a quick once over of the wine board, the prices are unbelievable! Some of the wines are even priced just at or even a bit below retail. Is this too good to be true? Lets hope not. This is exactly the type of news budget-minded New Yorkers have been waiting for. It's no secret that people have had enough of the outrageous wine pricing at NYC restaurants. That we should be made to pay a 150-200% mark-up for the so-called privilege of getting to drink a bottle of wine in a restaurant is absurd. Will this mark the beginning of a new era?

After reading on Midtown Lunch that Obika has finally opened, I scurried over from my office to the indoor Trump pavillion at the corner of 56th and Mad to see if this place really lives up to all the hype. While Midtown Lunch raves about the under $10 takeout menu, unfortunately all that customers can take out today are croissants and pastries. I was assured that the full takeout menu would be available tomorrow. Looks like they have some affordable Italian wines to pair with your lunch. Unfortunately, I don't think you can take those out. I did manage to grab a glimpse of some patrons lunching on some fresh and delicious looking mozzarella and nice-sized paninis and snapped a few pics at the scene. .gallery { margin: auto; } .gallery-item { float: left; margin-top: 10px; text-align: center; width: 33%; } .gallery img { border: 2px solid #cfcfcf; } .gallery-caption { margin-left: 0; } About time!

One of our favorite comfort food destinations is Cafeteria in Chelsea. Although we love the Cafeteria \"Mac Attack,\" we do not love receiving the bill after enjoying a number of their great strawberry mojitos (it does add up!). So, we decided to try HK for a very wallet friendly all-you-can-drink brunch yesterday. The bright white decor and outdoor seating made us feel like we were at Cafeteria (except for the fact we were a block away from Port Authority rather than a block away from all those great Chelsea boutiques). First, we were happily suprised when we learned that we could begin our all-you-can-drink $12.95 special at the bar while waiting for a table. We made some friends and received great (very energetic) service from our bartender, William. We decided to wait on a table outside (or semi-outside), so we took full advantage of the all-you-can-drink bellinis, mimosas, bloody marys, and champagne before we even sat down for brunch. Andy ordered the stuffed chicken with jalapeno cheddar mashed potatoes- William's recommendation- and I ordered an egg white omelet with brie and asparagus. Both meals were delicious, but Andy was definitely the victor with the stuffed chicken. The chicken was deliciously stuffed with goat cheese, sun dried tomatoes, capers, smoked bacon, and basil and the cheddar and jalepeno mashed potatoes were the best mashed potatoes I have tried in ages. Not the traditional brunch order but an amazing hearty balance of savory flavors and spice. Our meals came out to about $26 and our all-you-can drinks specials about the same ($12.95 per person, cash only). For an endless glass of champagne, bustling atmosphere, tasty meal, and friendly service, you cannot go wrong at HK. We will certainly be back. .gallery { margin: auto; } .gallery-item { float: left; margin-top: 10px; text-align: center; width: 33%; } .gallery img { border: 2px solid #cfcfcf; } .gallery-caption { margin-left: 0; } A bustling brunch scene Bellini #1 (all-you-can-drink special starts at the bar!)

It is less well known than its famed neighbours but is a good match for them. Fronsac is known for wines that are made with great care but don't cost a fortune. With a super vintage like '05, you can score some great Bordeaux wines from Fronsac and other not so well known areas that won't break your bank.

As part of the New York Food & Wine Festival, Gordon Ramsay sat down with Kim Severson of the New York Times for an interview and audience Q&A at the Times Center on Saturday afternoon. We are used to enjoying Ramsay's colorful personality when we watch Kitchen Nightmares and Hell's Kitchen, but we were not sure what to expect from the Chef in a sit down interview in front of an audience full of fans. We were pleasantly surprised to learn that Ramsay's fiery personality was just as entertaining in an on-stage interview as it was on reality TV. Ramsay did not hold back as he answered questions about his shows, his restaurants, his family, and his upbringing. He was charming, passionate, blunt, and very funny. Although some may have found his responses offensive (for example, his reference to a Parisian girlfriend in bed- it was like having a rottweiler chained to his chest), we found Ramsay's no holds barred style refreshing and definitely engaging. When he signed our book afterwards, we were even more impressed when he took the time to speak with us and to ask us questions. Although every other word out of his mouth may be an expletive, Gordon Ramsay is truly a class act.

NYC Wine & Food Festival: Price is Right Tasting with Josh Wesson

We attended a double-blind wine tasting in the depths of the Gansevoort Hotel led by Josh Wesson of Best Cellars. There were eight glasses of wine laid out in front of us: 2 bubblies, 2 whites and 4 reds. We knew that the wines ranged in price from $5 to $92 and we were given 8 specific prices ($5, $10, $17, $25, $37, $50, $72, $97) with each wine corresponding to one of the prices. Josh informed us that all of the wines were very highly rated, most receiving 90+ Parker and Wine Spectator scores. His aim was to show us how price does not always correlate to quality and that we are sometimes misled by our inherent price bias. Our goal was to taste each of the wines and correctly match a wine to its price. While we were close on most of the wines, we did not match a single wine to its actual price...as it turns out, we weren't alone either. Most people failed to correctly match a single wine to its price. We did, however, nail the identity of most all of the wines we tasted. Jill's highlight was correctly identifying the white bubbly as a Cava...pretty impressive. Great wine tasting overall. I guessed the $5 wine cost $50, making it a steal. It was a Meritage blend. .gallery { margin: auto; } .gallery-item { float: left; margin-top: 10px; text-align: center; width: 33%; } .gallery img { border: 2px solid #cfcfcf; } .gallery-caption { margin-left: 0; } The Price was Wrong...but the wine was great Jill ready to taste away Our tasting leader, Josh Wesson The Russell Crowe \"Gladiator' Method of Judging Wines SHARETHIS.addEntry({ title: \"NYC Wine & Food Festival: Price is Right Tasting with Josh Wesson\", url: \"http://www.winedanddined.com/2008/10/nyc-wine-food-festival-price-is-right-tasting-with-josh-wesson/\" });

While hundreds of others were across the bridge in Brooklyn at Rachel Ray's Burger Bash, we decided to hit up the venerable, iconic Corner Bistro in the West Village for some post-City Winery burgers and beers. We ate at stools by the bar with a perfect view of the Red Sox-Rays game and West Village people-watching. For a grand total of $29, we each had 2 McSorley's Ales, a cheeseburger and fries. The burgers were unreal. My past few experiences here had been fairly disappointing. I was actually wondering if it was too late to drive a couple of these beauties over to Brooklyn and crash the bash. This was the ideal Friday night budget-conscious meal out. In fact, we're happy anytime we get out with a tab under $100 on a weekend night. .gallery { margin: auto; } .gallery-item { float: left; margin-top: 10px; text-align: center; width: 33%; } .gallery img { border: 2px solid #cfcfcf; } .gallery-caption { margin-left: 0; } Mc'Sorley's Ale ($2.50 a pint...nice) Hello gorgeous A Pretty Darn Near Perfect Burger McDonald's-like shoestrings (a metaphor for our budget) Delish!

Last night we got invited to visit City Winery, New York's first private label winery. City Winery is the brainchild of Michael Dorf, an NYC entrepreneurial visionary who founded the Knitting Factory. Dorf and his team have transformed an old warehouse on Varick in the western reaches of Soho into a bi-level winery with tons of amenities, including 2 wine bars, professional kitchen, dining space, private event space, huge barrel room, stage for live music and events and much more. After a quick tour of the facilities, we were put to work -- fun work- de-stemming Cabernet grapes that had just arrived by refrigerated trucks. In fact, these very cabernet grapes that we were handling were hand-picked less than a week ago from one of several sourcing vineyards in Napa selected by City Winery. City Winery also sources its grapes from the Russian River Valley, Mendocino, Willamette Valley in Oregon and from local vineyards in the North Fork and Finger Lakes regions. I have to say there is something strangely therapeutic about moving your hands through cold, wet freshly picked grapes (actually look more like blueberries). We worked on the de-stemming line until vertigo had just about set in and then sampled some pre-feremented Zinfandel and Rose. .gallery { margin: auto; } .gallery-item { float: left; margin-top: 10px; text-align: center; width: 33%; } .gallery img { border: 2px solid #cfcfcf; } .gallery-caption { margin-left: 0; } SHARETHIS.addEntry({ title: \"We Have a Crush on City Winery!\", url: \"http://www.winedanddined.com/2008/10/we-have-a-crush-on-city-winery/\" });

We grabbed some tickets off Craigslist this week, below face I might add, to a couple of events at Food Network's New York City Wine & Food Festival. Here's what will be attending: Session 5: The Price is Right Hosted by Josh Wesson (Sold Out) Location: Hotel Gansevoort, 18 Ninth Avenue btwn 13th and Gansevoort Streets Hours: 1:30 p.m. - 2:45 p.m. Price: $85 [not including tax and service fee] Sold Out This playful yet educational seminar will take a cue from the Price Is Right game show to give participants the opportunity to experience the double-blind wine tasting technique in an exciting and revealing way. Expert Josh Wesson will select up to eight wines of varying type and from different regions around the world. Their market value—between $5 and $100—will be listed on a board without any hints as to which price tag goes with which bottle. It will be up to everyone to use their wine knowledge, along with information provided by Wesson, to make educated guesses as they attempt to accurately price each bottle. And don’t be surprised if the wine you enjoy least turns out to be the most expensive and vice versa: Wesson will explain some of the factors—including issues of stock availability—that figure into pricing. This seminar will be introduced by Travel + Leisure's Features Editor, Nilou Motamed. GORDON RAMSAY: \"Yes, Chef\" Whether he’s raising turkeys and pigs at home in England with his kids or yelling expletives at lackadaisical would-be chefs, Gordon Ramsay gets your attention as an advocate of simple, local food prepared well. You’ve seen him on TV (“Gordon’s Kitchen Nightmares,” “The f Word,” and “Hell’s Kitchen”), read his cookbooks and perhaps eaten at one of his restaurants. Now meet him in person to find out what gets him really excited. Interviewed by New York Times food reporter Kim Severson. One of four conversations about food and wine at The TimesCenter, in collaboration with the Food Network New York City Wine & Food Festival and celebrating the New York Times Magazine Food Issue.

3 courses, 3 wines for $38 until 10/17 We know that Benoit, Alain Ducasse’s latest New York restaurant in the old La Côte Basque space, has been panned left and right by the likes of Adam Platt and Bruni. But it's still Alain Ducasse, right people? Let us not forget that with his plethora of restaurants, cookbooks, endorsements and line of cooking supplies, Mr. Ducasse had three restaurants with three Michelin stars each—at the Essex House in Manhattan, the Plaza Athénée restaurant in Paris and the Louis XV restaurant in the Monte Carlo. In the 1990s, Mr. Ducasse became the first chef in 60 years to win six Michelin stars at once, for his restaurants in Paris and Monaco. And in 1990, at 34, he was the youngest chef in France to be awarded three Michelin stars, for his Monte Carlo restaurant. Despite what Platt (Alain Ducasse’s Benoit takes the New York brasserie craze to new lows), Bruni (Alain Ducasse's heart just isn't in the place) and countless others on Chowhound have had to say, we know a great NYC deal when we see one. As part of the Food Network New York City Wine & Food Festival's Wine & Dine NYC, Benoit is offering a three-course tasting menu and get this....each course is paired with a different New York state wine, all for a ridiculously low price if you use your AMEX card. We can't beat that price eating in, so we're going to go check it out and we'll let you know how it is. Benoit better be careful...prices this low can you get you Deathwatch'ed in some circles.

Just got word in our inbox of yet another European-style brunch party being thrown in the city this summer with pitcher service of brunch cocktails...but these guys have their own line of prosecco -- nice: Via dei Mille, the authentic Italian restaurant and lounge located on West Broadway in Soho, hosts a weekly European Brunch Party every Sunday. The all day event features live DJ's, great food, and brunch cocktails by the pitcher where guests dine, drink and dance the afternoon away. Restaurateurs Barry Mullineaux and Giuseppe Tuosto have crafted an elegant and enticing menu with options including Eggs Florentine, poached eggs & spinach with hollandaise sauce ($12); Caprese Panini, fresh bufala mozzarella, basil leaves and garden tomatoes with a basil-pesto spread ($16); Tuna Tartar in a lemon, tomato, basil, scallion and extra virgin olive oil dressing ($14); and Tagliolini Pasta with manila clams and diced tomato in a light white wine sauce. Their new line of prosecco, Via dei Mille Prosecco Extra Dry, can be enjoyed in many of the fresh fruit champagne cocktails that are freshly muddled to order and available by the pitcher. Via dei Mille is located at 357 West Broadway between Broome and Grande.

***CONTENT
We read the read the official press release on Cityfile and also received an email this morning from China Grill Management about the new Get Up Get Down Rooftop Pool Parties on Saturdays and Sundays all summer long at the Gansevoort Hotel in the Meatpacking District. The Gansevoort press release describes the concept: Create a vacation destination right on our doorsteps, catering to those who still want the summer experience in the city. With European guest DJ’s, signature tropical drinks, bottle service, a brunch menu and of course the fantastic pool, Get Up Get Down will be the first event of its kind in the city – an upscale rooftop brunch and pool party. Bringing the sexy St. Tropez feel to New York City every weekend. Sounds great, right? I checked out the Get Up Get Down website for more details. The site opens with a nice little flash video with dj music, lots of pictures of the Gansevoort Hotel pool and even images with scrolling text reading \"Get Wet.\" The website says that the roofdeck party goes to 8pm every Sat and Sun beginning May 30th with brunch service starting at 12pm. I still needed more deets so I called up the brunch reservations number. I spoke to a very nice woman who informed me that the Get Up Get Down Rooftop Pool Party does not include pool access and that the party is limited to the bar area and outdoor area attached to Plunge -- the rooftop bar. She informed me that the pool and pool deck is reserved exclusively for hotel guests. I also asked about the brunch service and was informed that brunch runs from 12-4pm, at which time all the tables turn into VIP tables reserved for bottle-service only. If all this is true, it means China Grill Management is promoting its so-called \"St. Tropez style weekend brunch & rooftop pool party\" with some mighty deceptive and misleading PR and website info. Doesn't look like you will be \"getting wet\" as the website promo promises or lounging poolside in your bathing suit sipping a mojito. We're looking into this further and will let you know what we are able to find out from CGM.

this is such a scam. Pool opens to those at the party around 4pm, at which time you will need to satisfy a table minimum to participate.

when i called to ask about it, they told me you have to partake in bottle service, aka spend hundreds of $$, to get access to the pool, and then you only get it after 4pm like Jeff said.

What the F: Chick-Fil-A Snubs NYC, Announces Debut of a Chicago Location

***CONTENT
What do we have to do to get a Chick-Fil-A here in Manhattan? And don't tell me that the location in the food court of NYU's Weinstein Center counts. If you thought this week's debut of Baja Fresh was big news, can you imagine the hype that would ensue if Chick-Fil-A announced plans to open locations here? Apparently, New Yorkers are going to have to wait at least another year to get their Chick-Fil-A fix without flying south. Crain's Chicago reported here yesterday that Chick-Fil-A is currently exploring sites for its first Chicago location. Apparently, Chick-Fil-A only opens about 70 new locations a year. Chick-Fil-A is undoubtedly well-aware of the demand for NYC locations. A simple Google search shows the high level of support. Click here, here, here and here. I sent Chick-Fil-A an email inquiry earlier this year about an NYC location and got the following response from a Chick-Fil-A Cares representative. All they could tell me is that New York is \"on their radar screen.\" From: Chick-fil-A CARES To: Freedman, Andy Dear Mr. Freedman: Thank you for taking the time to contact Chick-fil-A. You are very important to us, and we appreciate knowing that New York residents are interested in Chick-fil-A. Currently, there are no definite plans to develop additional Chick-fil-A Restaurants in New York. The one location you mentioned is a licensee location at New York University (New York University, Weinstein Food Court, 5-11 University Place, New York, NY 10003; 212-995-3057). Chick-fil-A opens approximately 70 new Restaurants each year. We receive literally hundreds of requests from customers regarding possible locations at or near which they would like to see a Chick-fil-A Restaurant. Although we appreciate our customers’ input, our Chick-fil-A Restaurant new opening locations are determined internally through our own market research after thoughtful analysis. Please rest assured, however, that New York is on our radar, and we will forward your request to the appropriate parties within Chick-fil-A. We also appreciate your interest in franchising a Chick-fil-A. Our Franchisee Opportunity program is designed for individuals who desire to personally operate their own business but may lack the large capital outlay. A Chick-fil-A Operator/Franchisee manages the restaurant on a day-to-day basis and may not have any other active business venture other than the restaurant. Again, thank you for your time and interest in Chick-fil-A. Sincerely, Tamara Chick-fil-A CARES

Citrine Lounge (59 W. 21st St. in the former Snitch space) is launching a new happy hour party called PRE. Every Tuesday through Friday from 5-11pm they will have a special happy hour cocktail and food menu. To celebrate PRE's launch, Citrine will be offering a free open bar tomorrow, May 28th, from 6-8pm. Citrine's food menu, which is available daily from 5-10pm, has been specially designed by Belgian neighbor Markt, and features traditional fare like Belgian frites with fresh mayonnaise ($6) and Green salad with goat cheese on croutons, honey and toasted pine nuts ($11), as well as dishes such as Tuna tartare with sesame seaweed salad, fresh lemon juice, wasabi and soy sauce ($14) and thinly sliced smoked duck breast with fresh greens and a truffle vinaigrette ($14). The new cocktail menu is specially designed by co-owner Adam Elzer and features an array of summer libations made with fresh ingredients and adapted from traditional family recipes, like the Berry Blossom ($7), made with Blueberry Vodka, St Germain, cranberry juice, and soda with a cherry garnish, and the Strawberry Nirvana ($8) a blend of Strawberry mix, Stoli Vanilla Vodka, and Champagne.

Finally someone other than Sunburnt Cow (unlimited Foster's w/ AYCD brunch) has stepped it up and is offering an AYCD beer brunch. Both Village Pourhouse locations (1 uptown near Columbia Univ and 1 in E. Village) are featuring all-day brunch parties this summer, with BBQ, bottomless beer, bacon and booze. There are even 2 separate menus: one offered from 11am-2pm and another from 2-5pm. The AM Beer Brunch features VP's French toast menu, flavored cereal milks and assorted breakfast entrees. The AM Brunch includes a two-hour all-you-can-drink Bud and Bud Light special. The PM Beer Brunch is an all-out backyard BBQ and includes hot dogs and hamburgers with different sides and condiments BBQ selections will include The Blitz - crispy bacon cheddar and BBQ sauce burger, and The Ballpark - a chili and cheddar hotdog). The PM Brunch includes two-hour all-you-can-drink Bud, Bud Light and Sagativa Lemonade Pitchers and Brunch Punch specials. Village Pourhouse Downtown: $25 for an entree and all you can drink special. Village Pourhouse Uptown: $20 for an entree and all you can drink special. Now, we're lookin' for someone to take the AYCD Beer Brunch to the next level by offering craft beers, or at least something better than Bud and Bud Light.

Burgers continue to be the talk of the town here in NYC with Pat LaFrieda and Black Label becoming household names. Over the past several months more and more bars and restaurants have been offering a burger and beer special. Irving Mill has a great Monday night deal that includes a different Sixpoint beer and cocktail each month. The Town Tavern is rockin' what it is calling The Great American Burger & Brew Challenge everday between 11am-6pm -- you get a 1/2lb cheeseburger deluxe + a 16oz Bud Light draft for $10 and if you finish the burger they'll throw in another Bud Light on the house. Now we get word that Bar Blanc Bistro has joined the fray with a Sunday night burger and beer deal where $15 gets you a burger, fries and a draft beer. And don't forget about BBB's other great deal-Mon-Fri from 5:30-7pm all wines by the glass, beers, cocktails and bar snacks are 50% off. Lookin' for more burger + beer deals. Check out here.

If you haven't already done so, then it may be time to get your 'Groupon.' The online deal-a-day coupon service is offering up a great one today -- pay $20 and get $50 worth of food and drinks at The Orchard. 260 of these coupons, excuse me 'groupons', have already been purchased today. Click here to get yours. You can buy as many as you want, but can only use 1 per table per visit. My recommendation -- go on a Sunday night when The Orchard is BYO. You may just get in for under $50 total -- which would make that a $20 meal for 2 with wine. Now that's recessionally special.

The list of street-food vendors using Twitter compiled and published by Serious Eats earlier this week is a great resource. We looked for a similar list of all New York restaurants and bars and unbelievably couldn't find one. Based on our hunting and pecking around on Twitter and the Internet, we have compiled the rather exhaustive (but likely still missing many) list of New York restaurants and bars on Twitter. If you know of others, please leave them in the comments. It seems that many of New York's dining and drinking establishments still aren't paying nearly as much attention to the Twitterverse as they should be. Maybe this run down of who is doing what will get them to tweet because we just hate being out of the loop for even a minute on what our favorite places are up to. While you're checking some of these out, don't forget to follow us @winedanddined UPDATE: Thanks to Grub Street for providing several NYC restaurants on Twitter that we had not yet uncovered. 675 Bar: @675Bar Frequent tweets on drink specials, events, who's pouring, what's pouring and more. Academia di Vino: @academiadivino Starting to get into a daily routine of tweeting specials of the day and special deals like this tweet: Monday Nights we offer our entire 900 bottle list at 50% off! A great time to try something you haven't tried before. See you tonight! Agozar Restaurant: @AgozarBistro Updates on food and drink specials. Ayza Chocolate & Wine Bar: @AyzaWineBarNYC Tweets have been few and far between and have mainly consisted of asking people to write-in a Zagat vote. Blanche's at DKNY: @BlanchesatDKNY Using tweets to get the message out about their menu and daily specials, and, in particular, that they are only place in Midtown serving Stumptown Coffee. Blue Fin: @bluefinnyc As with the other BR Guest restaurants, great use of tweets. Some interactive tweets asking for follower feedback on specials and ideas for specials, some informative tweets about daily menu features, info about cooking events and more. Blue Water Grill: @bluewatergrill As with the other BR Guest restaurants, great use of tweets. Some interactive tweets asking for follower feedback on specials and ideas for specials, some informative about daily menu features, info about chef cook-offs and more. Bobo: @boborestaurant Appears to be still figuring out Twitter identity. Random smattering of fairly useless information so far. Brooklyn Bowl: @brooklynbowl Tweets each day with a new \"under construction\" pic of the progress, esoteric New York bowling facts, upcoming events and more. Centro Vinoteca: @CentroVinoteca Appear to be fresh to the Twitterverse. Hopefully more tweets coming soon. Certe: @Certe Frequent updates on daily specials. Sample tweet: Don't forget our Afternoon-Pick-Me-Up $5 Coffee Drink and Dessert in our dining room Chop't: @Chopt Can't quite figure out what the h they're tweeting about. Citrine Lounge: @CitrineNYC Just getting underway on Twitter. The City Bakery: @citybakery A tweet every few days or so with ways to get freebies and other related info. Here's an example from an hour ago: Free fresh-squeezed lemonade with any pastry today until 8pm at Birdbath Green Bakery. See it here, say it there: 145 7th ave + Charles. Crif Dogs: @CrifDogs Only tweets once every couple of weeks. Destination Bar (opening soon at Avenue A and 13th): @DestinationBar Tweets on progress of the construction with pics and info. Also great photos on their website depicting the construction phase from the beginning. Dos Caminos: @DosCaminos As with the other BR Guest restaurants, great use of tweets. Some interactive tweets asking for follower feedback on specials and ideas for specials, some informative about daily menu features, info about cooking events and more. Eammon's Pub: @EamonnsBar Occasional Tweets on drink and dinner specials. Fatty Crab: @FattyCrab Haven't been any tweets since April, but they were tweeting specials and Twitter-only freebies. Sample tweet: First 50 people at Fatty before 1:30 who tell the barkeep to, \"Kiss their Nasi\", get a free PBR and barsnacks. Still bumpin, come on in!!! Goodburger: @mygoodburger Frequent tweets on promos (like $2 off milkshake) and specials. Sample tweet: Hey guys, skip the frappuccino today and refresh with a goodburger milkshake. Today 3-5pm get $2.00 OFF any milkshake at any location! Grotta Azzurra: @GrottaAzzurra Just one tweet. That's all it took. Havana Restaurant: @HavanaNY Only a few tweets, but perhaps more to come. Heartland Brewery: @HeartlandBrew Tweets fairly infrequent. One about celebs who visit HB, one about specials at HB burger. Hopefully more on the way. Hill Country: @HillCountryNY Info from the CEO about what's going on at HC and some musings about things he's doing. Hop Devil Grill: @HopDevilGrill Daily info on beer tastings, what's on tap, specials and more. Isabella's: @IsabellasNYC Tweets on specials and what's going on at the restaurant. L'Artusi: @LArtusi Few Tweets, but hopefully more coming soon. Manchester Pub: @manchesterpub More tweets about sports (NBA and the Mets) than food and drink. Matsuri: @matsurinyc Tweets about special bar menu, new menu items, cocktails, after-parties and more. The Mermaid Inn (UWS): @MermaidInnUWS No updates. C'mon, what are you waiting for? Morton's Steakhouse: @Mortons Frequent tweets with info on various Morton's locations throughout the country. Lots of interaction with others on Twitter. Looks like they search \"Mortons\" and RT relevant tweets. Also lots of tweets asking people how their meal was. Motorino: @motorino Tweets with special pizzas, soups and drinks. Still waiting for the tweet that tells us they're bringing back BYO. Num Pang: @NumPang Frequent tweets on daily specials and deals. One if By Land, Two if By Sea: @oneifbylandnyc Fairly frequent tweets with live entertainment info and info on specials, like this one: Our Monday specials are back! This Monday, May 4, at the bar, get a free glass of wine with every dish you order. Just mention twitter! Parlor Steakhouse: @ParlorSteak Tweets on recession specials, but have been few and far between lately. Patsy's Italian Restaurant (not related to Patsy's Pizza): @patsysnyc Tweets on food and drink specials, pics of what's going on at restaurant and what the managers are up to. PDT: @PDTNYC I guess it's Please Do Tell, or at least as far as there new drinks and new menu items go. The Pony Bar: @ThePonyBar Awesome use of tweets. Every time a new keg goes into the rotation, there's a tweet to let people know what it is. Sample tweet: Now batting, for The Pony Bar, Left Hand 400lb Monkey IPA. Porky's NYC: @PorkysNYC Tweets with drink specials, when there are \"hot girls\" on the dance floor and job applications. Primehouse: @primehouseny As with the other BR Guest restaurants, great use of tweets. Some interactive asking for follower feedback on specials and ideas for specials, some informative about daily menu features, and of course they didn't forget to tell you that the Burger of the Month Club picked their burger as the 4th best in NYC. Pure Food & Wine: @PureFoodandWine Tweets average once-a-day with info on special cocktails, general restaurant info, reviews and specials like this one: $5 glasses of SANGRIA until 7 p.m. Indoors Only on nights when the garden is open... a.k.a. TONIGHT!!! Rosa Mexicano: @RosaMexicano Appears to be run by PR. Giveaways to followers. Updates on promotions. Ruby Foo's: @rubyfoostimessq Tweets on specials, celeb spottings in Times Sq, and shout-outs to followers. Russ & Daughters: @LoxPopuli Tweets with info on news and events. Scarpetta: ScarpettaNYC Maybe Scarpetta will tweet more in its second year. Shake Shack: @shakeshack Not sure it's an official twitter account for the restaurant, but useful info on length of line at any given time. The Smith: @TheSmithnyc Fairly erratic tweets with reminders about Sunday burger+beer night, brunch, etc. Smorgas Chef: @SmorgasChef Very interactive tweets with its followers, asking how brunch was, what they would like to see on menu, etc. Twets with daily specials and frequent updates. Good use of Twitter. Southern Hospitality: @BBQNYC Multiple tweets a day with info on drink specials, dinner specials, info about sports on the tv's and other deals like this: Yankees vs Twins at 7pm. Wear your Yankees gear, get $1 beer (Coors Lt draft) during the game at Southern Hospitality. LET'S GO YANKEES!

My Own Benjamin Burger Challenge: Benjamin vs. Michael Jordan
***AUTHOR
Andy
***DATE
2009-05-14 14:05:00
***CONTENT
Something just didn't sit right with me after my Benjamin Burger Challenge experience last week, and it wasn't the Benjamin Burger. It was more the gimmicky nature of the so-called \"challenge\" and all the factors that tilted the playing field to the Benjamin's advantage, i.e. the other burgers had significant travel time, the Benjamin knew they were preparing their burger specifically for the \"challenge\" (leading you to wonder how the hell they overcooked the Feedbag's burger), the idea that it was all organized by the Benjamin PR team (should mention here that two of the three delivery burgers weren't close to medium-rare), and the question of whether pitting a steakhouse burger against high-end diner/fast-food burgers is fair. But then again if I had ignored the pleas of the Benjamin PR folks altogether, I may not have discovered what turned out to be a very well-conceived, well-constructed and well-crafted burger. I also discovered something even more critical -- the only way to truly compare burgers is to do so in a side-by-side tasting format. There are just too many variables to do it any other way. The real takeaway though was that the Benjamin Burger is a really damn good burger. But I couldn't stop there. I needed to find out for myself if it's consistently good and how it stacks up against another steakhouse burger. I needed a challenger. I had been hearing for quite some time that the Michael Jordan Steakhouse burger is a force to be reckoned with among steakhouse burgers. For whatever reason though, the MJ burger, like several other NYC burgers including the Molly's Pub burger, has flown way under the radar on the NYC burger scene. It made for an ideal contender, especially since Michael Jordan's Steakhouse is located in Grand Central Station just a block or so away from the Benjamin Steakhouse. I called up each of the steakhouses and placed an order for a medium-rare burger. I jumped in a cab and less than 30 minutes later, I was back at my office with both burgers. I have to say that the folks at the Benjamin did seem quite surprised to see me picking up a burger just a day after I had been there for the \"challenge.\" I told them I had a bit more investigative research to do. The goal -- to find out who has the 'Best Underrated Midtown Steakhouse Burger Near Grand Central': THE TALE OF THE TAPE Burger Blend The Benjamin: 100% USDA Prime Beef -- New York Strip, Rib Eye, Filet Michael Jordan's: Approx. 10% USDA Prime Beef -- Chuck and Top Round (80-20 blend, choice grade) + trimmed prime scraps from leftover prime Strip Loin cuttings Meat Purveyor The Benjamin: Strassburger Meats (Carlstadt, NJ) Michael Jordan's: West Conn Meat (Bronx, NY) for ground beef / Buckhead Beef (Atlanta, GA) for prime meat Preparation/Seasoning The Benjamin: Dry-aged for 28 days in dry-aging box / Seasoned only w/ kosher salt Michael Jordan's: Not dry-aged / Seasoned w/ kosher salt and fresh ground black pepper Cost The Benjamin: 1/2lb burger w/ fries = $15.95 **Also Includes Choice of \"Silent Options\": jalapenos mixed into the meat, sautéed mushrooms, sautéed onions, onion rings, bacon, thinly-sliced Canadian bacon, diced peppers (mixed with the meat), sautéed peppers, cheese, minced bacon (mixed with the meat) Michael Jordan's: 1/2lb burger w/ fries = $15.00 and 3/4lb burger w/ fries = $17.00 THE TASTING I again enlisted my friend Mark's assistance to help in judging the two burgers. Now, each of the burgers had about equal travel time and though not ideal, it made for a fairly level playing field. We halved the burgers and began tasting and comparing. The first thing I noticed was that the Jordan's burger had a lot more seasoning in the meat than the Benjamin burger. If it's just kosher salt and fresh ground pepper they season with, then there was certainly quite a bit of it, though not necessarily a negative. You could even see the seasoning encrusted in the cheese atop the burger. Check out the seasoning on the center of the burger in this pic. The second thing that was apparent was the Benjamin burger was cooked a perfect medium rare (though before cutting I have to say it didn't look so pretty). The Jordan's burger on the other hand was a tad overcooked and came in at closer to a medium than medium rare. You can see the difference in the pic below. After a couple of bites of each, it was way too difficult for me to determine which was the better burger. They both had unreal flavor and perfect burger-bun ratios. The Jordan's egg-kaiser bun was slightly sweet with a challah-like flavor while the Benjamin bun was a fairly standard old-school sesame seed. Mark and I both agreed that the Jordan's burger had the better bun. After a couple more back-to-back bites of each burger, I could tell that Mark had already made his decision. I was still struggling. Even though it was cooked a bit past my liking, this Jordan's burger was a flavor-bomb that was proving to be one helluva juicy and delicious burger. It had a nice external char and intense flavor. Like the first Benjamin burger we tried, this Benjamin was just as tender and loaded with a distinctive flavor of dry aging. Again the wonderful taste of this exquisitely-crafted, high-quality grind left me repeating aloud, \"damn, this is a good burger.\" It was even better prepared than the one the day before that had the home-field advantage. THE VERDICT After about my 7th bite of each burger, I finally looked over at Mark and said \"Benjamin\" and he nodded. But damn was it close. We both thought that if the Jordan's burger had been cooked properly and as perfectly as the Benjamin's, it may have been a dead heat. I still think the Benjamin would have eeked it out on account of the flavor of the meat, but it would have been very close. One takeaway is that the Jordan burger had almost as much delicious tender, juicy and rich flavor, despite no dry-aging of the meat. Next up for the Benjamin -- Wolfgang's Burger.

Here's a look at our dining and drinking picks for today in NYC: Head to Pranna (Madison b/t 28th and 29th) this evening, where they're celebrating World Cocktail Day in a major way. It's basically AYCD for 5 hours ($60) with specialty cocktails from 19 renowned mixologists, including Audrey Saunders, Dale deGroff, Allen Katz, J. In addition, there will be some finger foods from Pranna's kitchen to help soak up the alcohol. Waldy Malouf has been offering some terrific recession deals at his midtown restaurant Beacon (the 60-day Stimulus Plan includes 20% off a la carte menu items and 30 wines for under $30). We got word yesterday that he's offering a new special at his Flatiron pizza joint, Waldy's Wood-Fired Pizza & Penne (6th Ave nr 28th St.). The $10 Anti Recession Deal gets you a small pizza, salad and soda (and includes tax). And the part we like is that it also gets you $10 pitchers of beer after work. They have Brooklyn East India Pale Ale on tap. And here's a BYO special that shouldn't be missed. Tabla (Madison at 25th St) is offering “Tabla’s 10″ menu in celebration of the restaurant’s 10th anniversary every Wednesday night on the upper level of the dining room. The menu will feature a rotating set of small seasonal dishes, all priced at $10 or less, including items like sourdough nan stuffed with spiced potato, kalonji seeds and cayenne, and a Goan pork sausage sandwich on a brioche bun. Better yet, Tabla has a new BYO corkage policy in effect -- no corkage fee on first 2 bottles, $25 each additional bottle. We saved the best for last. It was not too long ago that a martini, itself, would cost you $20 in Manhattan. Betweeen now and May 16th, for just $20, Village (W. 9th at 6th Ave) will give you the martini + an 8oz grass-fed prime steak (or salmon) and half a baked potato. Now, that's a damn good deal.

The Benjamin Steakhouse Burger Challenge

***CONTENT
Little did I know when I first signed on to take the Benjamin Burger Challenge that it would eventually morph into the \"Underrated Midtown Steakhouse Burger Challenge\" with a showdown between the Benjamin Burger and the Michael Jordan's Burger. It all started a couple of weeks back with the following call to action from the Benjamin's PR firm to NYC food bloggers and burger critics: \"Critics are invited to come into Benjamin Steak House for the challenge, where we can speed deliver our competitors’ cuts right to the table; or, if preferred, directly to your desk to sample from comfort of your office.\" Some bloggers wasted no time in denouncing the legitimacy of the challenge in light of the Benjamin's obvious \"home-field advantage\" and the inherent unfairness to the challengers. Adam Kuban, managing editor of Serious Eats and founder of burger blog A Hamburger Today, left the following comment on Eater: \"Home field advantage is right, which is why AHT won't be taking them up on this thing.\" My feeling was that I would take them up on their offer and, at best, I would get to simultaneously try four NYC burgers, including one burger I had yet to try, and, at worst, I would write about the misgivings of a one-sided burger challenge organized by a steakhouse PR firm that will go to great lengths to garner publicity for its client's burger. Besides, unless your a burger aficionado the likes of Josh Ozersky or Nick Solares, it's not often you get the invite to taste test four of NYC's best burgers side-by-side. So I put my conscience aside and contacted the Benjamin's PR team to see if I could get in on the action (see disclaimer at the end). I received a response asking me to pick a time and day and informing me of the following: \"Our main challengers are BLT Burger, J.G. Melon, Corner Bistro and Burger Joint. We are recommending that reviewers pick their top three from these to rate side by side, but if you have one you absolutely MUST try next to Benjamin Burger, let me know and I’ll try to make it happen.\" I was hoping for at least one or two other steakhouse burgers (Smith & Wollensky Grill, Michael Jordan's, Wolfgang's, etc.) but I decided not to be difficult and selected J.G. Melon, Corner Bistro and Burger Joint as the challengers. A follow-up email informed me that we were all set for 1pm on Tuesday, May 5th for the challenge. To compare opinions and help determine the \"winner\", I would be joined by my friend Mark, who is a burger aficionado in his own right. Mark was the first to tell me about the famed $26 Minetta Black Label Burger, which I tried for the first time just two days before this challenge. You could let a Minetta Black Label sit in a 'fridge for two days and I'd still put it up against any burger in the city. Yes, it's that good. But back to the challenge at hand. Mark and I arrived at Benjamin Steakhouse and were graciously greeted by the staff and led to our secluded tasting booth. The four burgers were brought out to us and we didn't waste any time. We followed the Rachel Ray method of burger tasting, which involves cutting each burger in quarters and tasting from the middle. First up, we tried Burger Joint and the Benjamin burger. Burger Joint tasted like classic Burger Joint to me though it was closer to medium than medium-rare. I did notice that the meat doesn't seem as fresh as it used to be. Mark didn't care much for the Burger Joint burger, likening the meat to something out of a can of dog food. We both agreed that the Benjamin burger was well-prepared as a nice medium-rare, if not just a tad more medium, and exhibited a nice flavor profile. The difference in the quality of the burger blends between the two burgers was readily apparent. The Benjamin meat was juicy and moist with a nice char on the outside and had nice texture and a great depth of flavor. I guess the 28-days of dry aging has to count for something. It's only seasoned with kosher salt, and that's definitely all it needs. Just check out the juices seeping into the bun in the picture below and you can tell this is one heckuva burger. Of these two, the Benjamin was hands-down the better tasting burger. The meat quality wasn't even comparable. Next up was Corner Bistro and J.G. Melon. I've had numerous Corner Bistro burgers in the past and unfortunately the one that was delivered to us was nothing like what I usually get there. First of all it was way overcooked. Unlike the picture of the Benjamin burger above, there are no meat juices flowing between burger and bun. The burger was fairly dry and lacked the buttery texture and delicious flavor I have come to know from a Corner Bistro burger. You can see the difference in the bottom picture of a CB burger from a few months back. It was supposed to be medium rare and what we got was something between medium and medium well. This was my least favorite of the four burgers, lending some credence to the notion that Corner Bistro is the city's most overrated burger. I viewed this instead as an anomaly, or perhaps a sign of Corner Bistro's inconsistency, since the most recent burger I had there was one of the best I've had in the city. Mark pretty much agreed with me on this one, except he disliked the Burger Joint burger even more than the Corner Bistro one. Now, I'm not a huge fan of J.G. Melon (largely because I find the burgers a bit too small and not entirely satisfying) but the burger they delivered was pretty much spot-on medium rare. It was a well-constructed burger with a good burger-bun ratio. Solid. Very solid. We both agreed that it was far and away better than either Burger Joint or Corner Bistro with good flavor and texture, but that it still didn't hold a candle to the Benjamin burger. VERDICT Mark and I both agreed that the Benjamin burger out-classed and out-muscled its competition in this challenge. To be honest, it really wasn't even close. The half-pound, dry-aged Benjamin burger is the creation of Executive Chef Arturo McLeod, who spent 20+ years honing his meat talents at Peter Luger's. His burger blend consists of New York Strip, Ribeye, and Filet Mignon- all dry-aged for 28-days and seasoned in-house (using only kosher salt). This is one high-quality beef blend that exudes tons of flavor. At $15.95 including fries it's not a bad deal at all for a steakhouse burger, though it should be noted that none of the other burgers we tasted cost more than $8.50. If Benjamin would offer a quarter-pounder version w/ fries for $10 it would be a force to be reckoned with among Midtown Lunch'es. BUT NOT SO FAST I wasn't fully satisfied though. In light of the factors below that unfairly tilted the playing field, I couldn't bring myself to write this review of the challenge without confirming on my own whether the Benjamin burger is always prepared as well and tastes as good as it did that day. I needed another challenger. For months I've been hearing great things about the burger at Michael Jordan's Steakhouse. In fact, on the Eater post about the Benjamin challenge two commenters mentioned the Michael Jordan's burger, with one pledging his loyalty to it. As Michael Jordan himself is no stranger to what home-court advantage means, I decided to set up my own little follow-up Burger Challenge without either side knowing what was going on. Stay tuned to find out how the Benjamin burger stands up next to the burger that many call the most underrated burger in the city. I provide the following disclaimer in good faith and in accordance with the Food Blog Code of Ethics: 1. We did not pay for any of the burgers involved in the challenge (or for the glass of Malbec I drank). 2. All aspects of the competition were coordinated and organized by the Benjamin's PR firm, i.e. they ordered and picked up the challenger burgers, they selected the pool of challenger burgers, they hijacked the challenger's daily meat deliveries, etc. 3. The challengers faced a number of disadvantages, including but not limited to, the following: (a) there is no such thing as \"speed delivery\" in Manhattan during lunch, and as such, the challenger burgers experienced a significant delay time between exiting the grill/griddle and entering our mouths; (b) unlike the Benjamin, the cooks of the challenger burgers had no idea that the burgers were going to be involved in a competition; and (c) they're not using the exclusive Black Label blend developed by Pat La Frieda (note: the Benjamin burger and every other NYC burger is equally disadvantaged in this respect). 4. Benjamin Chef Arturo McLeod knew that he was preparing a specific burger specifically for our Burger Challenge.

Drink to Your Health: Rouge Tomate's New Lounge 'StirRED' Opens Today With Week-Long BOGO Special

We got word that StirRED, the new lower level lounge at Rouge Tomate, is opening today and that for the entire opening week \"your second drink will be on the house.\" Wonder if that applies to drinks 4, 6, 8 and 10, too. Rogue Tomate, the Brussels-based behemoth of a health-conscious restaurant on East 60th, adheres to an 85-page nutritional charter -- the sacred text of a corporate philosophy known as SPE, an acronym for Sanitas Per Escam, or Health Through Food. The doctrine involves nutrition, sourcing and social and environmental consciousness, and it is all monitored by a full-time dietitian. Curious where that leaves room for alcohol, but apparently the cocktails all have to play by the \"house rules\" and the pre-prohibition style cocktail list features a selection of housemade sodas, brandies and soaked cherries. You can expect about half the calories that these cocktails would typically have. StirRED also has a menu of various Tapas-style cuisine, as well as some sweet treats. The full menu appears below here. Singapore Sling Gin, Pineapple Juice, Lime Juice, Cherry Mai Tai Zacapa Aged Rum, Pineapple, House-made Almond Milk, Lime Juice Old Fashion Bourbon, Orange, Cherry, Bitters, Ginger Juice, Soda Moscow Mule Smirnoff, Ginger Beer Dark and Stormy Gosling’s Black Seal Rum, Ginger Beer Hemingway Daiquiri White Rum, Lime Juice, Grapefruit Juice, House-Made Cherry Liqueur Sazerac Rye Whiskey, Peychauds Bitters, Absinthe Queen’s Cup Pimm’s, Cucumber Purée, Mint, Lemon Juice Ramos Fizz Gin, Lemon Juice, Orange Juice, Orange Bitters, Yogurt, Soda Mint Julep Bourbon, Mint Syrup, Lemon, Served in a Classic Julep Cup Tequila Maria Tequila, Basil, Spiced Tomato Water, Lemon Savory Chickpea Hummus and Panisse Marinated Olives, Pickled Vegetables, Flatbread Crisp Tombo Tuna Poke Sugar Snap Peas, Honshimeji Mushrooms, Jicama, Sesame Heirloom Beet and Carrot Salad Horseradish Yogurt, Parmesan, Sugar Snaps Market Oysters Pineapple Vinegar, Crispy Ginger, Mint Duck and Pistachio Pâté Rhubarb, Pickles, Sourdough Toast Sweet Chocolate & Banana Caramelized Banana Napoleon, Roasted Banana Sorbet, Hot Cocoa Warm Almond Crepes Marzipan, Grapefruit, Kumquat, Toasted Almond Milk Sherbet Local Blue Cheese & Dried Fruit Chutney Semolina-Raisin Pain Perdue, Fuji Apple, Toasted Hazelnut Spring Fruit & Sorbet Plate Assorted Cookie Plate

My First Meal at Il Mulino (by Guest Writer Kristi)

Kristi
***DATE

***CONTENT
Antipasti: Bottles of wine consumed: 2 (1 white and 1 red) / Number of times \"Happy Birthday\" sung: 2. The start of your meal at Il Mulino is an onslaught. There is no other way to describe it. You are attacked from all angles and all directions with food. First, a huge bread basket is filled with rustic Italian bread as well as small, toasted garlic bread. Next, a plate of fried zucchini appeared. Both breads were delicious, but I thought the fried zucchini was way too oily. It's like the taste of the smell of your neighborhood Chinese food take-out joint. The flavor of the zucchini doesn't come out at all. But that was okay because next came the big hunk of cheese (which SO made me think of big hunk of cheese day from the West Wing). Everyone gets a smaller chunk of the larger chunk of fresh parmaggiano reggiano (one of my favorite all-time cheeses). Then came a fresh tomato bruschetta and exactly one mussel. The one mussel was not memorable. But the tomato brushcetta was delicious - fresh, bursting with flavor of the tomato and a hint of garlic and basil. I only wish they had given us just the tomatoes to put on the bread we already had out on the table because the bread they gave us was totally soggy. Which reminds me, we got yet another bread basket full of warmed garlic bread. I advise to try to restrain yourself during this onslaught. A ridiculously large meal is still in store. Piatti Del Giorno Quote of the night: \"I'd rather end up in rehab than have cats.\" Ha. I almost spit wine on my menu. Although the menu is quite extensive and includes the probably fantastic, but typical Italian fare, the real gems lie in the specials. My only problem with this is that the specials were almost as long as the menu itself and they recite them to you tableside. I used to be a waitress, so I understand how impressive it is to be able to rattle off a long list of specials for diners who can't imagine being able to memorize all that information. However, when specials are so long it takes 5 minutes to explain, I would prefer to have it written down. Listening to all the specials was way too much to digest (pun intended). But at the end of giving us the specials, the waiter said, \"and if you a wanna something else, we can make you whateva you like-a.\" Perfect. I had remembered a lamb ragu pasta dish that sounded wonderful. But it was served with spaghetti, and I prefer ragu with a wider pasta. I explained this to the waiter and asked for a tagliatelle, but he understood and immediately recommended the parpadelle over the tagliatelle, which is really what I wanted. I just get my pastas confused. I was in good hands. I relaxed. I had previously heard rumours about the larger than life portion sizes here, so my friend Wendy and I decided we would split a pasta and a fish. The branzini special sounded light and perfect - our waiter recommended that we get it grilled. He said it was much better that way. We were also instructed to get another fish, so we also ordered the salmon special, which came pan-seared with chanterelle mushrooms and broccolini sautéed in garlic sauce. I had already resigned myself to letting my waiter determine my culinary fate. I was in his hands, and I was not going to argue. Ginger and her mother split the porcini and truffle ravioli and grilled branzini. Ginger's brother, Chuck, got the filet. Despite the massive amounts of antipasti we were already served, I was ready to dig in. Primi: Number of bottles consumed: still 2 / Number of times \"Happy Birthday\" sung: 4 When the large bowl of pasta was set down in front of me, I immediately assumed that I would be splitting this bowl with Wendy. However, another large bowl was placed in front of her as well. Simultaneously, we looked at each other, then at the waiter. \"We split it for you already,\" he said. Holy mother. At the moment, I was happy we decided to split. But the next day, when I wanted to relive the sweet taste of lamb ragu, I was admittedly a little sad. The lamb was tender and it melted in your mouth and the homemade pasta was cooked perfectly. I was in an Italian wonderland of flavor. I also had the fortune of sampling the porcini and truffle ravioli. The sauce was thick and creamy and it highlighted the porcini flavor and the hint of truffle coming through in the background. The filling was similarly decadent. The ravioli pasta itself was good, but I thought it was a bit too thick. I would have preferred a more delicate ravioli. But who am I kidding? If that was my dish, I would have inhaled it. Photo of Raviolo ai Porcini (from CheekyEats) Secondi: Number of bottles consumed: 3 / Number of times \"Happy Birthday\" sung: 5 Next came the grilled branzini and the salmon. Each dish was extremely different, both in presentation as well as in taste, but they were both delicious. Before cooking, the waiter brought out the whole branzini fish to present to us. We just nodded our heads in drunken approval, as if we would have objected. The branzini was grilled with a tad of olive oil and simply presented with just a side of lemon. The fish itself was light and flaky. The fish was definitely the star of this dish. The salmon was pan-seared with mushrooms and broccolini in a garlic sauce that complemented both the fish and the vegetables perfectly. It was hearty, flavorful and scrumptious. I was impressed with a kitchen that could put out two completely different fishes (one practically bare and one dressed up) and yet they each stood up against one another in taste. I was so full that I only finished less than half of the fish. But luckily I took them home and ate them again for Saturday's dinner, and Sunday's lunch. I also got to try a small, but lovely piece of Chuck's filet. It was tender and cooked a perfect medium rare. All in all, the entrees were fantastic. I only wish I had room for more. Dolci: Number of bottles consumed: 4 / Glasses of homemade grappa: 1 each / Number of times \"Happy Birthday\" sung: 6 Please note, Chuck was drinking only beer and left us after his filet We decided on one light dessert (for our stomachs) and a classic dessert (for just a taste). We ordered the Zabaglione Caldo con frutti di bosco - a warm Italian custard with marsala wine, egg yolks and sugar (supposedly prepared tableside - I do not remember this) served with strawberries; and tiramisu. While awaiting our dessert, a friendly Italian waiter (is there any other kind?) came over with what looked like a wooden bucket full of homemade grappa, on the house. He ladled out a cup for each of us. After a few hair-raising sips of grappa, we decided on one more bottle of red to coat our throats. I was disappointed with the tiramisu - I have had better tiramisu during the feast of San Gennaro. However, the Zabaglione was delicious. I couldn't believe I had never had this dessert before. Light and sweet, it was perfect after a big meal. After over four hours of utter indulgence, I rolled out of the restaurant Violet Beauregarde-style, blissfully content with my first meal at Il Mulino and eagerly anticipating my next.

Trendspotting: Friday Boozy Brunches, Extended Brunch & Is Pitcher-Service the New Bottle Service?

***CONTENT
Maybe it's that the recession means there are more people day-drinking. Or maybe it's that Friday wants its own Fun-Day. Whatever the reason, there appears to be a movement towards a 3-day weekend of \"boozy brunching\" in NYC. Last month, Paradou announced that it was adding Fridays (11am-4pm) to its Unlimited Champagne Cocktail Weekend Brunch ($29). Then we got an email from Essex just this past Monday announcing that they, too, will be bringing their famous 3+ cocktail brunch ($16) to Fridays beginning May 22nd and going through Labor Day. Let's see who else follows suit. In other brunch news, we hear 230 Fifth will be soon launching an afternoon brunch and straight from the Eater Dealfeed that sister Aussie Sunday-Funday brunch spots Sunburnt Cow and Bondi Road have extended the hours for their \"Endless Brunch\" (all you can drink + any brunch item for $18) until 5pm. We also heard a little while back on GrubStreet that Nero, well known for its weekend AYCD brunch in the Meatpacking District, was growing a bit envious of its bottle-brunch neighbors Bagatelle and Merkato 55 and was going to begin experimenting with a bottle-service brunch. Supposedly, they were going to keep their AYCD brunch, too. It seems that may have all changed now according to a commenter. At least on Saturdays, the entire brunch menu at Nero is a la carte with $14 apiece mimosas, bloodys, and screwdrivers and, get this, $100 for a pitcher of any brunch cocktail. We know of other places with pitcher-service at brunch (notably Felix with its pitchers of mojitos), but $100 per pitcher? Seems like Nero's trying to make pitcher-service the bottle-service of brunch. So far it doesn't seem like the strategy is paying off for Nero. According to the commenter: \"Oh and it was empty at noon on a sunny Saturday, 3 people were there discussing how they were eating quick and then going elsewhere, no drinks.\" While we may have a lost a boozy brunch in Nero, it looks like Murray Hill has gained one in Van Diemens. This weekend marks the launch of VD's new boozy brunch -- available on Saturdays and Sundays from 11am - 4pm and featuring some typical brunch items, as well as a complete Irish Breakfast, Western Steak Omelets and Eggs Nova. The best part is for $18 you get your meal and unlimited mimosas, bellinis or bloody mary's. Also to be noted, Nero's new MPD sister restaurant, La Carbonara, is offering an AYCD brunch on Saturdays and Sundays from 11-4 where an additional $12 will get you unlimited mimosas, bellinis, bloody marys, screwdrivers and sangria.

You can't \"have your cake and eat it, too\" at this year's annual White House Correspondents' Dinner at the Hilton Washington this Saturday, where Wanda Sykes has been tapped to provide the entertainment. Attendees at Saturday's annual WHCA dinner will get no dessert, the funds being given instead to a local homeless shelter. What a great idea. Jill and I would be all over an idea like that at NYC restaurants serving prix-fixe menus. Give us a glass of wine, give some money to charity and hold the dessert. \"Because of the economy, we are cognizant of the situation in every industry, we are all dealing with the current economic climate,\" said Steve Scully of C-SPAN, a WHCA board member. \"We want the dinner to reflect that.\" Doesn't look like they'll be eating peas and carrots though. Here's a peak at the menu. First course: Sopresso, Prosciutto, Reggiano & Brie Plate, Spiced Olives, Wild Watercress Salad, Warm Crostini Drizzled with Balsamic Dressing. Entree: Porcini Dusted Petite Filet, Paired with Sun Dried Tomato Seared Escolar with Olive Tapenade, Mascarpone Polenta, Asparagus, Cipollini, Green and Yellow Squash, Porcini Mushroom Demi. Dessert: None. It's going to charity where it belongs.

Another (Slightly Hazy) Recap of a Wine Tasting at City Winery: Mendoza Crush Fest 2009
***AUTHOR
Jill
***DATE
2009-05-05 15:27:00
***CONTENT
Andy and I headed to City Winery (155 Varick at Vandam) on Sunday with our friends Nathania and Richard. After grabbing a pre-tasting drink at Ear Inn (one of the coolest old-time bars I've been to- move over McSorley's), we headed to the Mendoza Crush party. It had been postponed due to the grapes' boat being held up for poor weather conditions (\"not pirates\") out on the seas. The grapes arrived from the Algodon Wine Estates in San Rafael, Mendoza, and the crush was just starting when we arrived. Because we had some fun getting our crush on previously at City Winery, we decided to leave the grape sorting behind for some serious wine tasting. Good choice number one. Getting Started: There was a tasting area set up with a host of different wines from Mendoza. The tables were not too crowded since we arrived on the early side and avoided the ridiculously long food line. Good choice number two. Why were people waiting on an endless circling line for small samples of barbeque when there was so much good wine ready to be tasted? We had grabbed a barbeque brunch earlier at Wildwood BBQ. Good choice number three. A huge plus for those waiting in line- some nice wine reps were walking along the line and filling their glasses as they waited. The Wine: Argentina has some really great value wine options. I tried a number of wines under $10 that really could do a decent job at any barbeque, summer party, or as a daily table wine. The most famous Argentine red varietal is Malbec (originally from Cahors in the south of France) and the most famous Argentine white varietal is Torrontes (100% Argentine). I stuck with the classics in most of my tastings, but I was surprised to try some nice Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot blends and some really nice Chardonnays and Viogniers. I also never had tried a Bonarda, but realized that this varietal is abundant and low in cost in Argentina. I particularly enjoyed the Xavier Flouret wines- a \"curated portfolio of high-quality, boutique wines from generations-old family vineyards around the world...\" (whose Argentinean wines were being offered on Sun.- obviously). I also enjoyed the sponsor's wines from the Algodon winery (with a team of pourers of well dressed men with Argentinean accidents). The Verdict: After a couple of hours of tasting, my notes go blank and the memory gets hazy. I do remember thinking what a great idea a Sunday afternoon wine tasting is... Sunday Funday! I also remember Andy and Richard sneaking out back to the barbeque to bypass all service lines and snag some snacks that were being prepared courtesy of La Rural Bistro Argentino (Amsterdam b/t 97th and 98th). I do not remember the decision to head to Minetta Tavern for dinner, but I do remember the exceptional drunken dinner and the world's best burger (not sure if this 'world's best' distinction was decided because of the wine-haze or because the Pat La Frieda Black Label Burger is truly unbeatable... I'm going with the latter for now). It was an afternoon of great wine (and a little not so great wine), great food, and great company. The Vacation Idea: After a successful tasting, we also have a new vacation option. The folks at Algodon Wine Estates run a resort, and our friend Kelly took a trip there with her family. They said it was fabulous- golf, horseback riding, white water rafting, and lots of wine...Vacation anyone?

World Cup of Beer 2009

This Saturday, our friends and fellow beer lovers, Martin and Riki, co-hosted the first-annual World Cup of Beer (2009). The premise: an eight beer, single-elimination blind tasting NCAA tournament-style. The rules: each participant tastes two different unmarked beers from clear plastic cups (to ensure a good look at the color of the beer, thank you Riki). Whichever beer had the most votes moved onto the next round. Eight countries were represented - England's Old Speckled Hen (a last minute addition to the tournament after the Fuller's London Pale Ale mysteriously disappeared out of Martin's fridge; Martin blames his \"cleaning lady\"), Scotland's Brewdog Punk IPA (ABV: 6%), Japan's Hitachino Nest Japanese Classic Ale (ABV: 7%), Norway's Nogne O IPA (ABV: 7.5%), France's St. Amand French Country Ale (ABV: 5.9%), Italy's Super Baladin Ale (ABV: 8%), New Zealand Moa Premium Lager (ABV: 5.5%), and USA's Rogue American Amber (5.6%) (America - F*ck yeah!). We drew names out of a hat to determine who would square off against one another in the first round: USA v. Japan (USA), England v. Italy (Italy), New Zealand v. Scotland (New Zealand), and Norway v. France (Norway) With the exception of the Super Baladin Ale, I did not pick a single winner in any of the rounds. Apparently, I preferred the least popular brews. But the voting was generally very close. The only blow out was a match where the winner won 11-1. Unfortunately, no one can remember which match that was, though our friend Charles seems to remember it as the England vs. Italy since he recalls being the only one who voted for England. In his words, \"I didn't like how the Italy beer tasted as sweet as something from Willy Wonka.\" In between our tastings, we had a fine selection of beers to cleanse our palates: Andy and Jill brought growlers of Captain Lawrence Double IPA and the Dogfish Head 90 Minute IPA; I brought a growler of Six Point Eight Days of Wheat; Martin supplied bottles of Dogfish Head 60 Minute; and Riki brought a Lagunitas Hop Stoopid. We were sufficiently prepared to get drunk enough to, say, fall asleep on the M15 bus and wake up in Chinatown. Thank you Google maps for getting me home. In the second round, Italy was the clear winner over the USA but the Norway/New Zealand match was much closer. We took a break to watch Mine that Bird miraculously win the Derby, right before our championship round. And like Mine that Bird, out of nowhere, Norway took our championship 8-5. Although I still think Italy should have taken it all. All in all, it was a great day for the underdog. Here's a sheet with a description of the World Cup of Beer competitors:

May the Fourth be with you! Actually, May the Fourth be with our friend and time-to-time guest contributor Adam down in Atlanta who's celebrating a birthday today. Here are some of this week's best specials, including a Southern-style one in honor of Adam: Pera (Madison b/t 41st and 42nd): It's May Meze Madness at Pera. Through May 30th, choose any three meze out of 15 options for just $9 (Monday through Friday from 3:30 p.m. until closing, Saturday from 5:30). Double up on your special until 7 p.m. nightly, when you can get a glass of wine (from any of Pera’s 15 wines by the glass) or a specialty cocktail (such as the Peratini – Ciroc Vodka, blackberry puree and elderflower) for just $9 to accompany your mezes. Or until 7pm, you can add a bottle of wine (from a selection of 35) for $30. Scarpetta (W. 14th nr 9th Ave.): Celebrating its 1-Year Anniversary in recession-special style. Offering 4-course prix-fixe with wine pairings for $50 during dinner service (May 4-8; 212-691-0555) Jane (Houston b/t Thompson & LaGuardia Pl): A Southern take on the Burger + Beer combo.

Nice! Elizabeth (Elizabeth b/t Houston and Prince): Cinco de Mayo party out back on the deck. There will be custom gelato flavors like Tanteo chocolate tequila sorbet and Tanteo jalapeño tequila for $.50 a scoop, and more importantly there will also be $.50 tacos, $.50 shots of tequila and special $5 cocktails from 4-7pm.

There will also be piñatas and raffles for free tequila shots. Also during the day they'll be offering the $9 brunch drink special, which will gets you a choice of three Bloodys, Sangrias or Mimosas. I could use a boozy brunch right about now. Irving Mill (E. 16th nr Irving Pl): Word on the street is that Ryan Skeen will be moving on in a couple of months, but let's hope that he leaves his Monday night $15 burger + beer + more special behind. This month is Tame That Tiger Mondays where you get Ryan Skeen's burger, a pint of Sixpoint's Bengali Tiger and a tequila-based \"hornet\" cocktail, neat or on the rocks, for $15.

Recession Special Alert: Introducing \"Groupon\"

We recently happened upon a new NYC-based online coupon website called Groupon. Every day Groupon offers a new deal from New York restaurants, spas, theaters, events, and more. It's an idea based on a power in numbers, \"collective buying power\" theory. Here's how it works: Groupon promises a business, let's say a restaurant, that it will sell a minimum number of coupons by the end of the day. If you want the deal, you cruise over to the Groupon website and click \"BUY\" before the offer ends at midnight. If the minimum number of New Yorkers sign up before midnight, you'll get a printable gift certificate in your inbox the next morning that you can use until the offer expires. If not enough people join, no one gets the deal and you don't get charged. Today's inaugural Groupon is a $25 voucher to Stir Restaurant (1st Ave @ 73rd) for just $10. Interested? Check out the Groupon website for more details. Looks like at least 20 people have to sign up for the deal for it to be good.

Just read on Nation's Restaurant News that Bruegger's Bagels is seeking to expand into the NY market and it has its eyes on a Midtown location. I was introduced to Bruegger's during my four years in Ann Arbor where the Burlington, VT-based retail bagel concept had a location right on campus. They are shooting for late this year for the first NYC location and hope also to open locations at NYU. Brugger's bagels were solid, if not memorable. They offered an array of deli sandwiches on choice of bagel, coffee and soups. It looks like they've expanded the menu to include paninis and a new line of hot and cold sandwiches.

NYC's Most Unlikely Recession Special: The Legends Suite at Yankee Stadium
***AUTHOR
Andy
***DATE
2009-05-04 03:46:00
***CONTENT
I received an email this past Thursday afternoon from a business partner asking if I'd like two tickets to that night's Yanks game against the Angels. When I realized that these tickets were not only in the Legends Suite section, but were also in the second row behind first base, I pounced. I had heard a little bit about the premium, high-end amenities and features of the Legends Suite Club but had no idea what Jill and I were in store for. We arrived at Yankee Stadium, in all its modern-day, coliseum-esque glory, and proceeded directly to the Legends Suite area. After we got our wrist-bands (think all-inclusive resort), we walked through the entrance that leads you into the top-level of the bi-level Legends Suite Club. Looking around, the decor felt more like a high-end downtown steakhouse than any stadium club we've ever been in. To our right was a sleek bar area with more flat screens per square foot than ESPNZone. And to our left was an amazing looking buffet and dining room. From the bar, you could look out to the field and see the game. Jill and I took a lap around the buffet and then looked at each other and asked \"How much must this cost?\" It made it more fun that we had not done any research on the Legends Suite and so you can imagine our surprise when a server told us it is all free with our Legends Suite access. Everything that is except for the alcohol, which would be fine unless you're Jill and me. We contemplated our next move as we ordered a drink at the bar (Jill a gin and tonic and a brooklyn lager for me): (a) do we grab a drink and go check out our seats, (b) do we walk around and explore the madness that is the Legends Suite, or (c) do we attack this ridiculous buffet. It took not long for option (c) to prevail and we separately made our way around the complimentary all-you-can-eat buffet. We rendezvoused at the bar where our drinks were awaiting our return. I had made my way to just about every station at the buffet. There was a filet mignon station, a paella station, a load your own baked potato station, a hot dog and mini monte cristo station, a duck station, a chicken and butternut squash ravioli station, a salad station and more. Here's a photo tour of my trip around the buffet: We almost forgot we were here for a baseball game. After finishing up our buffet plates and drinks at the bar, we finally made our way down to our seats. Walking through the bottom level of the Legends Suite club, we realized there was another huge buffet set up with what looked to be the same items as the upstairs buffet, as well as a bar with draft beers. As you exit the Legends Suite to take your seats there is a \"grab 'n go\" area with free bags of peanuts, M&M's, cracker jack's, and more. I grabbed some peanuts and M&M's just because. Thankfully, there was enough early action in the game that it was only the bottom of the 2nd inning when we took our seats. The seats themselves are worth mentioning with their teak arms and full cushions. We were struck by how empty the 1,800 or so seats in the Legends Suite area were compared to how packed the rest of the stadium was. Then came our next surprise. All of the food on the massive In-Seat Dining Menu is FREE. I suddenly wished I hadn't gorged myself at the buffet. But that didn't stop us from ordering (for free) a Carl's Philly Cheesesteak, a Lamb Gyro Pita and Truffle Fries. Other options included a Lobster Roll, Flatbread with Goat Cheese and Pancetta, a few special selections from Fresco by Scotto Restaurant, and more. Jill ordered a dirty martini which they brought in a souvenir-style shaker that had at least 2 full martinis in it. She swears it was as good as any extra dirty martini she's had. I stuck with the Brooklyn Lager. We also discovered that there is a dugout lounge (called the Ketel Lounge) close to our seats with more free food to grab on the run, including more Carl's Cheesesteaks and a freezer with ice cream bars, clean bathrooms and a nice bar. It turned out to be a great game to boot. The Yanks came from behind to win with a big rally in the 8th. Now I know you're thinking' \"Yeah maybe a nice recession special when you get the Legends Suite tickets for free, but what about when you have to pay for seats yourself?\" Here's the deal, though. These pricey tickets in the Legends Suite area with all the amenities and free food have plummeted on the resale market. According to an ESPN article, Legends Suite seats for Friday night's game against the Los Angeles Angels that originally sold for $500 could be had for $144 shortly before 5 p.m. on StubHub.com. Legends seats in section 16, row 9, behind the first-base dugout were available for $199, down from their $850 original price. \"We're seeing an unprecedented number of season-ticket holders selling. The market has been flooded. It is a buyer's market for baseball fans,\" said Mike Janes, chief executive officer of FanSnap.com, an Internet search engine that finds tickets on resale sites. Now, if you're willing to go during the week and it's not the Red Sox or Rays in town, you could probably score Legends Suite tickets for less than $100 each. With all the amenities (oh yeah, did I mention the flat-screen TV's in the restrooms), free food and royal treatment, not to mention the great seats at the new Yankee Stadium, we're calling this the most unlikely Recession Special in town.

All these places look great! One I didn't see on the list that I have had great experiences with in the past is SOBs (Sounds of Brazil, 200 Varick St., in SOHO). If you're looking for a unique and awesome experience for the whole family check this place out. I went last year with my fam and had a blast with Brazilian dishes and Bossa Nova. I recommend it - check out their website at: http://www.sobs.com/

I went to Atlantic Grill for Mother's Day yesterday and the experience was indicative of everything that is wrong with the UES (from the perspective of a guy who lives in the UES with his girlfriend.)....too many strollers, too many toddlers treating the restaurant like their own playpen and parents sitting idle, admiring with the grandparents how cute the children were as they slammed into the back of my chair and created an obstacle course for the waiters.

BYO's Spreading Like the You-Know-What Virus

While the SLA has been cracking down on restaurants with temporary BYO policies -- those that allow BYO while they await their liquor license -- several restaurants are following in the footsteps of Alto and either waiving or relaxing their BYO policies to attract customers. We all know the NYC BYO mainstays (think Tartine, Nook, Poke, Cube 63, Peking Duck House, Persimmon, etc.) but did you know, for example, that Houston's is BYO with no corkage fee at both Manhattan locations or that The Little Owl is BYO with no corkage fee on your first bottle? In a recent WSJ piece, Danny Meyer explained why he's been relaxing his restaurant's BYO policies: \"I would imagine that many wine lovers have more bottles in their cellar than they're going to drink in a week, a month, a year, maybe even a lifetime and they're waiting for a special occasion to open them. We wanted to encourage people to enjoy what they already own and at the end of a delicious meal, they can see that the check is smaller.\" In fact, for the month of May, Danny Meyer's Union Square Cafe is reducing its corkage fee from $25 to $10, which is \"really gentle\" according to Meyer. We agree. To find some other \"really gentle\" BYO policies, we've done a bit of groundwork on GoBYO.com and created a list of some of the best BYO spots around the city with corkage fees of $10 or less. But please always call first to verify. We'd hate for you to be left holding the bottle. A Cafe & Wine Room - BYO w/ no corkage fee Alto -- BYO w/ no corkage fee Apiary -- No corkage fee on Monday nights Baoguette / Baoguette Cafe -- BYO w/ no corkage fee Beacon -- No corkage fee on Sunday nights Broadway East -- No corkage fee on Sunday and Monday nights.

@ musigny -- i agree with you. in the plural sense, BYO should be BYOs. i think i was using it in the sense that \"BYO Is Spreading Like...\", so i think \"BYO's\", as in \"BYO is\", is appropriate grammar. but since i do like talking about BYOs in plural, i think i'll list another good one for you -- corkage has been waived until memorial day at dylan prime.

Island Burgers is no longer BYO w/o corkage. They serve a pretty generic selection of beers and wines now. Went there the other week, they charged $10 for a six pack of beer, or $2 per bottle. Not sure on the wine $$.

A Flea Grows in Brookyln (by Guest Writer Kristi)

Saturday I had a chance to visit the Brooklyn Flea in Fort Greene. The Flea, which opened for the season last week, is open on Saturdays from 10am-5pm and features 150 vendors selling clothing, antiques, jewelry and food. As NYMag pointed out a couple weeks ago in its 'Edible Schoolyard' piece, the Flea has become a new destination for food-lovers. I wanted to investigate. First, I recommend checking out the Flea in the late afternoon. The crowds are smaller and vendors are more likely to give you deals (both on clothing and on food). Despite the much smaller, late-afternoon crowd, the line in front of the soul food stall was by far the longest. That was a good sign. Although long lines usually mean good food, I didn't have the patience to wait on line to try what they had to offer. But it was by far the most popular stall when I was there. Note to self if I ever return. I was really there to try one thing - the empanadas from Elsa's Empanadas. This piping hot, baked pastry is filled with ground beef, olives, raisins and hard-boiled egg. You can get 1 for $3 or 2 for $5. The empanada pastry itself was excellent - flaky and buttery. However, I was disappointed with the filling. I am not a huge fan of olives (other than in my martinis) and I did not really like the raisins. I guess I am a purist when it comes to empanadas. I also tried samples from WannaHavaCookie. The sample chocolate chip was yummy (other flavors include snickerdoodle, toffee mills and molasses spice). They also have the cutest homemade whoopee pies. They were pushing a new flavor, vanilla pie with a strawberry filling, but my friend Becky wasn't a fan. However, I would still be interested in trying a different whoopee pie flavor- like peanut butter and chocolate or the classic chocolate and vanilla- under different circumstances (i.e. not baking in the sun all day). The food highlight for me was the fresh ricotta I brought home from Salvatore Brooklyn. They sell a ½ pound for only $7; for $9, you get the ricotta and a fresh, huge baguette from Amy's bread. Because it was the end of the day, the very nice woman working the stall threw in the bread for free. This ricotta is creamy, fresh and delicious and the bread was perfectly soft on the inside and crusty on the outside. I have been snacking on it all weekend. The stall also sells cannolis piped with the fresh ricotta. Now that I know how delicious the cheese is, I regret not getting one of those Italian treats. I don't know if I would head all the way out to Fort Greene again just for the food at the Flea (Salvatore sells its ricotta in several other locations, and it is a long walk from the Atlantic/Pacific subway stop). But, everyone I encountered was so friendly and generous (the woman who sold me a beautiful necklace gave me a discount for paying cash and gave me some of her sun block!), I would go back if I was ever in Fort Greene again on a Saturday. The Brooklyn Flea - located at Bishop Loughlin High School on Lafayette Ave between Vanderbilt & Clermont Avenues in Fort Greene, Brooklyn.

Another day. Another Restaurant Week. Not that we're complaining, though. Especially since this one revolves around wine. Vibrant Rioja, an organization formed to promote the Rioja wine region in the U.S., has teamed up with 50 or so NYC restaurants to offer prix-fixe deals and other specials that revolve around the region's bold, bright tempranillo-based wines. The specials vary by restaurant, so we've done a little digging to un-earth the best Rioja Restaurant Week deals: Smith's (MacDougal nr Houston) -- Offering 25% off any Rioja bottle. Go Monday or Tuesday night and double your Recession Special by combining with the $35 Chicken For Two offer. Thanks to Grub Street, we already know this one's a good deal. Chinatown Brasserie (Lafayette nr Great Jones) -- $50 four course prix-fixe that includes a complimentary glass of Rioja. Check out the menu here. Bond St. (Bond nr Lafayette) -- $50 four course prix-fixe that includes a complimentary glass of Rioja. Check out the menu here. Cru (5th Ave. at 9th St.) -- The granddaddy of NYC wine lists, Cru is offering both a $50 four course prix-fixe and 20% off bottles of Rioja. Here's the menu. Indochine (Lafayette b/t 4th and Astor Place) -- Offering a diverse $50 prix-fixe that includes a glass of Rioja and also 20% off bottles of Rioja. Here's the menu. Center Cut (W. 63rd in the Empire Hotel) -- Offering a nice menu that includes 3 courses plus sides for 2 and a complimentary glass of Rioja for $50. Here's the menu. Eighty One Restaurant (W. 81st nr Columbus) -- Here's another chance to double up on your Recession Special. Go for the $30.81 eco(nomy) friendly menu and add a 20% off bottle of Rioja. David Burke Townhouse (61st b/t Park and Lex) -- Get a three course prix-fixe for just $25 a person. Also per the Feedbag, you can bid on high-end wines on the wine list. Sounds fun. It was hard to watch the Kobe Club video on the Rioja Restaurant Week website without feeling a little bad. While they're definitely not gonna be offering a $50 prix-fixe with complimentary glass of Rioja anymore, $50 may get you a couple of samurai swords. Like you couldn't have guessed that Artisanal would be participating in this special. They're doing a $50 prix-fixe with complimentary glass of Rioja and 20% off a bottle of Rioja.

Fresh off it's 50% off everything-on-the-menu special on Tax-Day that packed the house, One if by Land, Two if by Sea has launched a Recession Special that it's calling the \"After-Work Supper.\" It's actually a nice, euphemistic spin on the \"Early-Bird Special.\" The deal is $45 per person and is available Mondays through Fridays between 5:30-6:45pm. Sadly, the Beef Wellington is not listed among the entree choices. See the full menu here. Kinda looks like an extension of Restaurant Week for OIBLTIBS, but with a $10 supp.

***CONTENT
From the submission wire, we learn that The Grape Brokers at Marc Forgione is hosting a Three-Course Domaine du Vieux-Telegraphe Vertical Dinner at Marc Forgione this Wednesday. This is one for our \"If Money Were No Object\" list of events. Tickets are $185/ $350 per couple (all-inclusive)and are limited to 36 seats. For tickets or more info, contact Melissa@TheGrapeBrokers.com or call 917.902.3354. Domaine du Vieux-Télégraphe is one of Chateauneuf du Pape’s most famous estates. Guests will be tasting 1997 through 2003 vintages. Here's a look at the menu and pairings -- looks like you get 2 glasses per course! First Course: Egg Yolk Ravioli, Braised Ramps, Duck Confit, Garrigue Essence 1997 Domaine du Vieux-Télégraphe Chateauneuf du Pape la Crau Wine Advocate # 121, Feb 1999 RP: 87-89 “The 1997 Chateauneuf du Pape is an evolved, forward, richly fruity wine with medium body, and plenty of smoke, pepper, Allspice, black cherry and Provencal herb aromas. It is seductive, round, charming, and sexy. The wine reveals pepper and spicy aromas.” 2000 Domaine du Vieux-Télégraphe Chateauneuf du Pape la Crau Wine Advocate # 145, Feb 2003 RP:91 “The elegant 2000 Vieux Telegraphe La Crau possesses 14.8% alcohol, along with a deep ruby/purple color, charming, rich, fruitiness, and firm tannin in the finish. With loads of freshness, copious quantities of pepper, seaweed, and black fruit characteristics, and a distinctive minerality, this full-bodied, sweet 2000 requires 2-3 years of cellaring; it should age well for 15-16 years. Anticipated maturity: 2005-2018.” Second Course: Vadouvan Curry Braised Lamb, Cancale Carrot Puree, Chios Spiced Peas 1999 Domaine du Vieux-Télégraphe Chateauneuf du Pape la Crau Wine Spectator, Dec 15, 2001 WS:91 “Beautiful Rhône red. Full-bodied, rich and ripe, with plum and blackberry notes and some real tannic grip. Mineral edge adds complexity to this impressive Châteauneuf. Built for the cellar. Best from 2003 through 2010.”–PM 2001 Domaine du Vieux-Télégraphe Chateauneuf du Pape la Crau Wine Advocate # 151 Feb 2004 RP:93 “The 2001 Chateauneuf du Pape La Crau is gorgeous, structured, impressive. Full-bodied…with great depth, purity, and heady aromatics, this 20,000-case blend of 60% Grenache, 15% Mourvedre, 10% Syrah, and 15% miscellaneous amounts of the other permitted varietals will easily rival the 1998. A deep ruby/purple-tinged color is accompanied by a sweet perfume of salty sea breezes, seaweed, melted licorice, kirsch liqueur, creme de cassis, and iodine ... a classic Vieux-Telegraphe aromatic display. Powerful as well as firmly structured, this is a wine to lay away for 4-5 years. It should prove to be uncommonly long-lived, lasting a minimum of two decades. It gets my nod as the greatest Vieux-Telegraphe since the 1998.” Third Course: Cheese Affine 1998 Domaine du Vieux-Télégraphe Chateauneuf du Pape la Crau 1998 Châteauneuf-du-Pape Retrospective Sep 30, 2007 WS: 94 “The color remains dark, with aromas of grilled herb, tobacco and beef leading the way for currant, chestnut and garrigue notes that are carried by the prominent tannin structure. The chewy, mouthfilling finish is starting to let some sweet flesh come out from behind the iron and stone notes. Still needs time, but this is rock solid. Best from 2009 through 2027.”-JM 2003 Domaine du Vieux-Télégraphe Chateauneuf du Pape la Crau Wine Spectator, Dec 31, 2005 Top 100: 2005, Rank: 53 WS:93 “Tight at first, but quickly picks up steam in the glass, with dark cherry, plum, tobacco, pepper, mineral and hot stone notes pumping through the long, fruit- and terroir-filled finish. Really fleshes out nicely, with velvety tannins that are atypical in '03. Drink now through 2020. 17,000 cases made.” –JM

Work Hard, Play Hard, 'Wine & Dine' Hard, Cleanse!

We've been doing some aggressive wining and dining lately, so with the weather starting to finally turn and with summer in sight, I figured it was about that time of the year to kick up the exercise routine and to get healthy. I cannot give up all the great food, wine, and craft beers that I love, but to balance things out, I could use a mid-week break every now and then to make sure I'm ready for bikini season (and to make sure my body is more happy with me- especially my liver). So, we've been hearing about the Blueprint Cleanse for a while and have had some friends who have been doing the cleanse fairly regularly. I brought up the cleanse at a friend's birthday party last weekend, and I was shocked to hear that 2 of the people I was talking to had tried it and spoke highly of it! I checked out the Blueprint Cleanse on-line and learned that a 1 day cleanse cost $75 and a 3, 5, or 6 day cleanse costs $65 per day, so before I jumped into a 3 day juice diet (that would cost $195), I figured I would do a test run for 1 day. I cancelled my happy hour plans for Thursday night and I ordered 1 day of the \"Renovation Cleanse\" on-line. There are three levels of the cleanse (Renovation, Foundation, and Excavation- sounds scary), so clearly I went with the beginners \"gateway cleanse.\" The website says that this level is for the beginner - \"the 'I'll have my martini with a side of steak, please' type.\" Perfect- I'm in! The Goods: I picked up my Blueprint Cleanse supplies on Wednesday after work, the evening before the cleanse was to begin. They will deliver it to you (at your \"home, office, corner deli, or wherever else you're going to be\"). The deliveries happen between 3 and 9 pm on Sundays and Wednesdays and they will call you 15-20 minutes before delivery to give you a heads up. One of their pick-up locations happened to be on my walk home from work route, so that was an easier choice for me. My juices came in a nice purple thermal lunch bag with an ice pack to keep them cool. The thermal bag was in a very fashionable lime green tote. All the bottles were numbered and the ingredients were labeled (this is a very easy, i.e. an idiot proof cleanse- the bottles even state: \"We Think. You Drink.\"). The packaging, website, logos, etc. were all very sleek and modern- just like you'll be once you start cleansing! I was into the vibe and was excited see a cleanse welcome e-mail as I embarked on my day of cleansing. The Drinks: Drink No. 1: Romaine + Celery + Cucumber + Kale + Parsley + Green Apple + Spinach + Lemon = What am I drinking here?!? I read the ingredients first, and, although I eat and enjoy all of them individually, I did not think having them juiced and blended together would be an enjoyable experience. I was actually surprised to see that I didn't mind the juice. It's certainly green, but it tastes reasonably good. I think the sweetness from the green apple was a much needed addition. It doesn't taste too vegetal, and I ended up having no problem with my green juice breakfast. If I had any suggestion for the juicers over at Blueprint, it would be to add a little mint (but then again, they're the experts, not me). Drink No. 2: Pineapple + Apple + Mint = Awesomeness! I feel like I could be drinking this out of a martini glass at a rooftop bar on a hot summer evening or out on the beach with sand underfoot and palm trees swaying overhead. The mint really adds a refreshing element to the juice and balances out the sweetness of the pineapple. Drink No. 3: Romaine + Celery + Cucumber + Kale + Parsley + Green Apple + Spinach + Lemon = Yep, Again. Ok, back to my green juice breakfast. This kind of makes sense. With all the veggie juice, it does feel more like a meal than just having fruit. I also feel (with no basis at all) that I should be more full after drinking this than the sweeter juices. Drink No. 4: Water + Lemon + Cayenne + Agave = Did I accidentally sign up for the Lemonade Diet? Remember all the press about Beyonce and Robin Quivers (from Howard Stern) losing a ridiculous amount of weight on the Lemonade Diet (or the \"Master Cleanse\")? Women all over the country were living off nothing but freshly squeezed lemon juice, cayenne pepper, grade B organic maple syrup, and water. Well, switch the maple syrup to agave, and we've got the same spicy lemonade here. I LOVE it though! The cayenne pepper is so subtle but it does really add an undertone of heat, and other than that you're drinking lemonade. This is a kicked up version of our favorite childhood summer drink. I could really drink this all day. Drink No. 5: Carrot + Apple + Beet + Ginger + Lemon = Time for Dinner. Now, I'm getting a bit hungry at this point. I was in the mood for something savory, so this mixture sounded good. It still has the sweetness from the apple juice, but the heartiness of the beet really dominates. I was excited by the ginger, but there is more of a subtle ginger hint than an in your face ginger kick (I was thinking of the orange ginger dressing at the corner sushi place). I like it, but I am imagining my favorite beet salad and wishing I had a clump of goat cheese to bite into. Color = beet red. Suggestion = more ginger. Drink No. 6: Water + Raw Cashews + Agave Nectar + Vanilla Bean + Cinnamon = Nirvana. I'm not a dessert person. At all. But boy did I appreciate this sweet treat at the end of the day. It exceeded all of my expectations for what could come out of a 16 fl. oz. bottle that was dairy-free, healthy, and that never underwent any fermentation processes. If I was on this cleanse for 3 days or even 5 or 6 days, I can see how this stuff could be my reward at the end of the day. Sides: You are supposed to start off your morning with warm or room temperature water, which I did (more so because I forgot to restock the fridge with water the night before). You can have as much herbal tea as you would like and as much water in between meals. My friend gave me a special fasting tea from Yogi Tea, which was very nice (made with garcinia fruit to suppress the appetite). I'm a tea drinker and very, very rarely have any coffee, so this worked well for me. You are also supposed to drink a bottle of water in between juice meals (which are supposed to be spaced at least an hour apart, and which I kind of did). The Verdict: Success! I woke up Friday morning feeling fully refreshed, cleansed, and not at all hungry. It was easy, and the price was worth it for the quality of juice and for the convenience. I wouldn't be juicing this stuff myself in my kitchen at home. I will say that next time I will attempt 3 days, but that's going to be tough. The hardest part of my day was certainly not hunger- it was heading home after a long day of work realizing that I wouldn't be having Andy's-famous-grilled-anything for dinner and realizing that I couldn't delve into the kitchen myself to whip something up with a glass of wine in hand. This was certainly not a problem for one night, but the thought of two more nights of a juice dinner would have been tough. It is about working hard and playing hard, though, so I guess this is where my will power has to kick in next time around.

Cha-Chang! NBCNewYork.com's 'Locals Only' Street Cart Serves Up Food Nirvana For Lucky Few

It almost all seemed to good to be true -- 70 degrees, not a cloud in the sky, a beautiful weekend to look forward to and an email in my inbox Friday morning granting me access to a free meal prepared by chef of the moment, Momofuku's David Chang. But this wasn't just any meal. For one day only, David Chang was taking to the street and working his Momofuku-magic from a food cart. For close to three weeks, thousands of people clicked their way to NBCNewYork.com at 11am sharp each day to answer a brief series of NYC celebrity chef related questions in hopes of being one of the lucky few granted access to the info on the uber-secret street cart location. We hear only around 160 people were selected out of close to 10,000 contest entries. The Chang street cart event was one of the NBCNewYork.com Locals Only meet-up activities, which include concerts, free meals from local chefs and more, that is part of a new marketing push at NBC to transform their local station websites into online destinations. I arrived at the \"secret\" address (318 Lafayette St), which turned out to be the parking lot of Win Restaurant Supply Co., gave my codeword and was allowed in. Surprisingly, it wasn't the mob scene you would have expected. The event coordinators did a great job with crowd control and the line for food at the cart never seemed to be more than 20-25 deep. Even though the secret location was leaked earlier in the day by several websites, the people running the show had a list of all those that had been emailed with access and you had to match your codeword to your name. Guests were given a menu with 3 choices for the meal: vegetarian (rice fries, a shiitake bun and ginger rice noodles), pork (rice fries, a pork bun and sweet/spicy sriracha rice cakes) and chicken (rice fries, a chicken bun and smoked chicken wings). Or you could go for the wild card \"Dealer's Choice,\" which included duck rillette (pulled duck meat) and lobster and grits with a poached egg, scallions and crispy ham chips. Unfortunately, the \"Dealer's Choice\" was no longer by the time I arrived, but they were doing a special lamb shawarma -- the epitome of street cart food -- which came with beets and a white sauce. Some lucky ones were also getting a jar of foie gras (pork terrine). Two picnic tables seated about a dozen guests and those who couldn't grab a seat opted to sit on the asphalt. To quell the burning sriracha post-lunch mouth feel, I went for some of pastry chef Christina Tosi's old fashioned donut soft-serve ice cream made from organic ingredients. It was the real deal.

Yankee Stadium Offers a Wide-Range of Ways to Kill Yourself with Food
***AUTHOR

***CONTENT
(Welcome back by popular demand our friend and guest writer Kristi) Disclaimer: the following account of my weekend of gluttony at Yankee Stadium is a true and accurate description of the events that transpired. This is my story (cue Law & Order music). Saturday – Yankees v. Indians (4-22 loss): My friend Keith and I started Saturday at the bowling alley across from the old stadium with a couple of bud lights. We wanted to show some respect to our old favorites (Stan’s was too packed to handle), and start our day with $4 beers since the average beer at the stadium is $9. When we finally entered the Great Hall and walked through to the concessions, Keith began salivating over the garlic fries immediately. You can smell them as soon as you walk in. But we went straight to our seats because we wanted to catch the first pitch. We started our culinary adventure in the top of the second inning with the Baseball Classic – a Nathan’s hotdog and a beer (Bud Light). The days of the “dirty water dog” appear to be as over as Chien-Ming Wang’s chances of getting his E.R.A. under 10 this season. These hotdogs were kept in an insulated “cooler” and came wrapped in foil, already in the bun. The hotdogs, mine with ketchup, Keith’s with mustard, were just as delicious as last season and only cost $4.50. Phew. First test passed. After only 1 and a 1/3 innings of good baseball, we set out to explore the stadium, and most importantly, to explore the food. The game was already over at this point. We went straight to the bleachers, which you now have access to. One of the scariest parts about the new stadium is that every concession stand has the calorie count of every item offered. Who knew that a hot pretzel had over 600 calories? The bleachers have concessions from Johnny Rockets, Moe’s Southwestern Grill, Familglia’s Pizza and the usual baseball fare. We opted for a Johnny Rockets single cheeseburger (a double is over 1,000 calories!), a side of onion rings, and more beer. We ate in a nice-sized standing area overlooking the outfield, watching our Yanks continue their downward spiral. The burger, which came with lettuce, tomato and pickles, was good. Not the best, but very respectable. The onion rings were also good - greasy, but crispy, and not soggy at all. After laughing at some Mets fans, Keith and I moved on to discover a venerable food court on the lower level in left field. I was overwhelmed with choices – Nathan’s, Arthur Avenue Deli, Boar’s Head sandwiches, Sushi, Noodles, Familglia’s pizza. We decided to walk around, see our options and digest. We happened upon a glass window with a butcher cutting raw beef. We had heard about this! A Lobel’s butcher slices beef in a creepy, peep-show-like window (I was half expecting Madonna to start dancing behind the butcher), and then sells $15 sliced-steak sandwiches at a nearby stand. We weren’t quite ready for a steak sandwich, so we went back towards the food court area. It took me all of 3 minutes to decide that I was ready for dumplings. The Noodle stand sells noodle bowls, egg rolls, and dumplings. For $6, I got 4 boiled pork dumplings. Note: the stand has crusty-looking food in the display window, but you do not get that food when you order. Depending on how you like your dumpling dough, you’ll either like or not like the ones offered here. It is a very doughy dumpling. I am obsessed with dumplings of all kinds so I was pleasantly surprised with the quality. They did not skimp on the pork and the meat had good flavor. One of the great things about the new stadium is that you can order, eat your food and still watch the game at the same time. You don’t have to go through a tunnel to get to the food and beer. So we stood in left field for a bit watching the game and talking with fans that happened to be eating chicken sliders. With their nod of approval, we went to the sliders station. This stand had the option of beef sliders, chicken sliders and buffalo chicken sliders. You can get just 2 sliders, or 3 sliders and fries. For some odd reason they were “out of” 2 sliders, but were able to give us the 3 chicken sliders with fries platter. I argued, but they said that was the rules. I was annoyed at the logic, but not the result. We took the 3 chicken sliders with fries and got more beer. The fries were crinkle cut, like Nathan’s, but not nearly as good and a bit soggy. The chicken sliders were good, much like any elementary school fried chicken cutlet, but I wish they had come with cheese or mayo or something. I ended up putting a lot of ketchup on mine. At that point, Keith was still talking about garlic fries, so we wandered back towards the first base/right field side (we had almost completed a full circle). On the way, we happened upon the “farmers market” pictured here. This market basically consisted of a stand with fresh fruit – apples, pears, etc. It’s no Union Square, and certainly nothing we were remotely interested in eating that day. So we moved on, passing Joba’s father on the way. We were back by the garlic fries, Carl’s cheesesteaks, and the Latin corner. A fellow fan said the cheesesteaks were really good. I was very tempted, but very full. While debating what our stomachs could handle, Keith dared me to get a sample of the garlic fries from the vendors. No problem. However, behind the counter stood a large clear bucket filled with oil and minced garlic. It almost repulsed me enough to not actually try the fries. But I went for it, and with my powers of persuasion, I convinced the vendor to give us a sample. We decided to get a full order for about $6. The fries were much crispier then I expected – with all that oil, I was expecting them to be very soggy. However, they were thin, crispy and not too greasy, but they were very garlicky. We couldn’t finish them, but agreed they were good. At this point in the game (remember, we were there for baseball?), the Indians were beating the Yankees by about 3 touchdowns, so Keith and I decided to head to Tommy Bahamas’ Bar located on the second level in the Great Hall. Shots. We needed shots. A quick shot of Jameson led to a couple of more beers for me, and a Jack and Coke for Keith. He decided to step it up a notch. Although you are not allowed to leave the bar area with liquor, we poured Keith’s drink into one of the many commemorative Yankee cups we had collected (I’m hoping to have a full beer pong set of cups before the all-star break), and headed back to our seats to watch the end of the game. Alcohol note: the bar only has Tommy Bahamas’ rum and the Beers of the World venue at the stadium isn’t open until next month. We got back to our seats just in time to see the 8th and 9th innings. When our shellacking was official, we decided to head to the Hard Rock Café for a nightcap. The bar at Hard Rock was way less packed then I expected, keeps normal restaurant hours, and has typical bar food. We got more beer and decided to get an order of hot wings (choices: hot, very hot or bbq), we got hot. They were good - meaty enough and hot enough for me. We enjoyed. We finally left the stadium around 10pm, after almost 8 hours of eating and drinking. And went to another bar. Good day. Sunday (Yankees v. Cleveland 7-3 win): If you can believe it, Keith and I headed back up to the Bronx for more punishment the following morning. I found Keith waiting for me at Hard Rock with a Bloody Mary and an empty plate of wings. He was hurting. We headed into the stadium through the Hard Rock (a nice feature) and set out to our seats in the bleachers. The bleachers have far fewer vendors actually walking around in the seats selling food, but since you have access to the entire stadium now, it doesn’t really matter where you sit. Sunday’s game was actually exciting, so we sat in the sun and actually enjoyed a little April baseball. After the fourth inning, we both decided that we had dropped the ball the day before by not trying the steak sandwich, so we headed straight to Lobel’s. Even though they have a guy cutting the meat right at the stand, the sandwich we bought had been sitting for a while. The cheese-crusted round roll was a little soggy, but the meat was tender, tasty and cooked medium. The sandwich was very good, but it was very hard to justify spending $15 on it. $10, maybe. We continued walking around a bit, contemplating pulled pork sandwiches from Brother Jimmy’s and eggplant parm heros. I decided to get dumplings again (I have a problem). Keith got a chocolate milk shake from Johnny Rockets. My dumplings were the same as they were Saturday, so they were consistent. Keith’s shake was so thick he could turn it upside down and nothing fell out. That’s how I like it and it was delicious. Our food adventure ended there - I think we both shot our proverbial wad the day before. But, we did get a chance to check out the museum at the stadium. Thurman Munson’s locker, a wall full of baseballs signed by everyone to ever wear pinstripes, and the most recent World Series trophies are the highlights. The Yankees won Sunday’s game in dramatic fashion and we had a great weekend. I was scheduled to go to Monday night’s game as well. But-for a rain out, I would have tried the sushi, the Brother Jimmy’s hushpuppies and either a Philly cheesesteak, or one of the sandwiches from the Arthur Avenue deli. Luckily for me, there are 77 more games played at home this year.

Bad News For NYC In-N-Out Worshippers
***AUTHOR

***CONTENT
So I came across an interview on Fast Company with Stacy Perman, who literally wrote the book on In-N-Out Burger, the family-owned chain that has become a cultural institution. Unfortuantely, as is the case with some other cultural institutions outside of New York (think Waffle House, Chick-fil-A, etc.), they have yet to bring one to NYC. According to a July 2007 post on A Hamburger Today, Departures Magazine started a rumor that In-N-Out was planning a New York debut. Since then we've been waiting and waiting, but no In-N-Out. According to Stacy Perman, it doesn't look like we'll be getting one anytime soon, either. But did you know the reason is because of where In-N-Out gets its beef? Can that really be it? We've got friggin' Pat La Frieda for goodness sakes. I'm sure he would make them an \"exclusive\" black label mix. If you're headin' to the West Coast anytime soon, I can't think of any book that would be better to read on your flight there. Here's the disturbing news from Ms. Perman, herself: FAST COMPANY: So what's next for In-N-Out? Are there plans to move out East? SP: It's slowly expanding, with emphasis on the word \"slowly.\" When [family heir and soon-to-be owner] Lynsi Martinez takes control of the company, she could change things. But there's a reason In-N-Out only exists in four states. Each restaurant gets its beef from specific commissaries, which are within a 500-mile radius. So jumping from Utah to New York seems unrealistic. Oh yeah, and she has some ominous news for Shake Shack if the expansion rumors turn out to be true: You don't think In-N-Out should go public? No, I really don't. When you go public, you open yourself up to a whole new set of pressures you have to follow, and I think that might change the unique culture of In-N-Out. Look at Krispy Kreme. It had a huge fanbase, and people were clamoring for more locations across the country. So Krispy Kreme obliged. It had an IPO in 2000, and it was very successful. But then the chain started rapidly expanding, and soon you could buy Krispy Kreme doughnuts in supermarkets. It just wasn't the same product. There are so few \"real deals\" left, and In-N-Out is one of them.

Just got the email with the secret location and my codeword for today's David Chang Street Cart lunch event. It's so nice of him to cook us up a free lunch that I think I'll return the favor and bring him a little present -- a bottle of Pliny the Elder (my favorite beer -- thanks for the introduction Phil). Notice Paradou in the background of the invite picture to the left - Hint: don't go to that location in the Meatpacking. That's not where it's going down. But definitely do go to Paradou this weekend for the best outdoor AYCD Brunch NYC has to offer. Their outdoor garden is sick! $29 gets you a brunch item and all the bellinis, mimosas and kirs you can handle.

Which Recession Specials Are Really Special?

***DATE
2009-04-23 12:46:00
***CONTENT
With all of the Recession Specials being offered by restaurants these days, it can be difficult to determine the really good ones from the not so good ones. Some are no-brainers. Bar Blanc Bistro's 50% off bar deal (5:30-7pm Sun-Fri) which they recently extended indefinitely is hands-down a no-brainer. Same with Ammos' 50% off your entire bar check on Monday and Friday nights. And ditto to Irving Mill's Monday night $15 Beer + Burger + Whiskey deal. Some restaurants, however, seem to just be offering Recession Specials for the sake of offering Recession Specials. Take Rosa Mexicano's 25-Years=25% Off Anniversary Offer for instance (note the Recession Special in disguise). 25% off sounds pretty good on the surface, right? But take a closer look and you soon realize how asinine this 25% offer is. First, you have to have lunch at Rosa Mexicano and keep your receipt. Then to get your 25% off, you have to go back to Rosa Mexicano (only valid for lunch) within 7 days. I don't know about you, but apart maybe from co-founders Doug Griebel and Dan Hickey and their families, I don't know too many people that are eating lunch at Rosa Mexicano two times a week. We'll keep doing our part to help you navigate the vast sea of recession special choices. Thankfully, there's also Grub Street's \"Deal or No Deal\" and Recession Reviews by 89th & Broke (check out this one of Tabla's 10, a menu of small plates for under $10) to help guide you. Grub Street has yet to strike out with a Recession Special, concluding that both Smith's $35 Chicken Dinner and Elleteria's $33 3-course prix-fixe are DEALS.

We hear the weather is gonna be heatin' up for the weekend and that tomorrow's gonna be beautiful. Well, if you're not one of the few lucky ones that scored an invite to the uber-secret David Chang street cart lunch bonanza tomorrow, we have something else to give you a reason to take an extra-long lunch break. ZagatBuzz reports a \"picnic in the park\" deal at AQ Kafe near Columbus Circle (Broadway b/t 58th and 59th). For $14.95 a person, they'll make you a box-lunch with your choice of sandwich or a salad, side, dessert and a drink. But here's the best part -- if you order with 4 or more people, they'll also throw in a frisbee. I have a feeling MidtownLunch would be all over this picnic idea if AQ Kafe would find a way to offer this for under $10 -- hey, why don't they just make it choice of side or dessert and chop off 5 bucks from the price? Just a thought.

Dutch eatery Danku has opened in Midtown to mixed reviews, though Cravings swears by the Indonesian Sloppy Joe + Organic Fries and NYC Foodie recently discovered some unique dishes there worth trying. We got word from Danku today that come April 30th, which just happens to be Queen's Day (Holland's National Holiday), they will begin serving made-to-order stroopwafels, which they tell us are popular sweet treats in the Netherlands. I think I know why these waffles are popular in Amsterdam. In fact, I think I probably had one or ten while I was there last. The waffles will be made on a genuine Dutch waffle-maker. They also tell us that Stroopwafels, which translates literally to “syrup waffles,” are different from the thick rectangular Brussels-style waffles most people think of. They are made with two thin round waffles sandwiched together, with a soft caramel filling in the center. I have a feeling we'll soon be hearing from bloggers and Midtown Lunch commenters whether it's Danku or No Danku to these Stroopwafels. Stay tuned.

A (Slightly Fuzzy) Recap of Last Night's Wines of Portugal Tasting (Plus Why Our Friend Kristi May Start Dating Car Salesmen)
***AUTHOR

***DATE
2009-04-22 11:59:00
***CONTENT
We have recently discovered Portuguese wines and have been greatly impressed with this mostly undiscovered (at least for Americans) wine region. They are producing some really top quality, age-worthy wines that would rival some of neighboring Spain's great wines. We also love the fact that there are amazing value wines coming out of Portugal - including many for under $10. We hit up the Wines of Portugal tasting event last night at City Winery, and we're happy to introduce a post from our friend and guest writer Kristi: Portugal - Where There's More than Just Port - Last night, Jill, Riki and I met some friends and went to the Wines of Portugal tasting event at City Winery to promote WomensHeart. Having traveled briefly in Portugal, I have blurry recollections of sipping on some fantastic port, but I do not remember having any amazing wine. So, this tasting was a great opportunity to discover some non-port gems. Wine tastings are tricky for obvious reasons - no food + lots of wine = forgetting what I drank. But luckily, I e-mailed myself my favorite tables of the evening (the lawyer in me coming out, clearly). They are as follows: tables 43 and 44, where charming Italian men from Monte Da Penha and Quinta de Ventozelo poured some great whites and ports; tables 47-48 had by far my favorite whites of the evening from Wines & Winemakers by Saven (although, sadly, they're only available in Connecticut right now), they were crisp, light and fantastic; table 49 had a great set of reds as a whole from Sogrape Vinhos S.A./Evaton Inc., and the gentleman doing the pouring was nice enough to direct us to the best port and best overall red of the tasting, which was rather courteous of him; table 50 had the best port of the night from Premium Port Wines, Inc. where a cute, older gentleman (who kind of looked like the Gordon's fisherman - without the yellow getup) commanded the port stage; finally, table 39 had the best overall red that we tried - it was from Herdade Da Malhadinha Nova where the owner's niece does the drawings for the labels - look for a hand drawn cow and you know you've got the right wine. There were definitely some miss-hits - I tried at least two whites that were terrible - very clear (as my friend Kate pointed out, it looked like vodka in a wine bottle), flat-tasting and with a slight, unwanted carbonation. The most difficult part of the evening was the fact that we were unable to pronounce any of the varietals, but Portuguese sounds like drunk Spanish, so that was no surprise. I do recall, however, that the Alvarinho (pronounced Al-va-reen-yo) region was very popular. All in all, it was a successful evening - I even got a phone number from one of the pourers who started the pour with, \"I'm a car salesman, I don't give a sh*t about wine, it's my father's wine.\" He then proceeded to pour us great wine and confiscate wine for us from other unsuspecting tables.

A Brunch of Pics: Absinthe Wine Bar Brunch Fades Into Oblivion While Tre's AYCD Emerges From Relative Obscurity

***CONTENT
We set out early Sunday afternoon with one goal in mind -- to find another standout all-you-can-drink boozy brunch spot in the East Village/Lower East Side. We had checked out Yerba Buena (Ave. A b/t Houston and 2nd) last month and both agreed it's one of the best AYCD brunch spots in Manhattan. Here's why: they don't just pop open cheap $5 bottles of champagne for their $12 unlimited drinks option (cash or AMEX only) or pre-make big mimosa pitchers, but instead offer 3 cocktails that actually receive a fair amount of attention from a mixologist, including a fiery jalapeno bloody mary. (NB: YB's brunch menu says there's a 1-hour limit on the AYCD -- but they didn't enforce it when we were there) Also, the food didn't take a backseat to the booze like happens at so many brunch spots (did I say Sunburnt Cow -- actually, Jill just reminded me that our omelette of the day with sausage and Monterey cheese on our last visit to Sunburnt Cow was definitely better than the omelette at some other brunch spots). The bartender recommended the Steak \"a Caballo\", or steak n' eggs, which I devoured, while Jill loved her Ensalada de Pollo (chicken breast with baby spinach, jicama and avocado) and a side of tasty wild mushrooms. The place is small and gets packed so would recommend making a reservation. If you're spontaneously lazy like myself, you should be able to find yourself a couple of seats at the bar no problem. So back to this past Sunday. We thought Absinthe Wine Bar was going to be our place so we made our way over to 1st Ave (nr 6th St.). We had heard about the $9 unlimited drinks on Grub Street here that includes specialty cocktails like pineapple mimosa, pomegranate mint bellini, absinthe sangria and more. An additional $11 for food, juice and coffee would make this a pretty hard to beat brunch. Unfortunately, the honeymoon is over for brunchers at Absinthe Wine Bar. Now it's $20 for menu item + 3 cocktails, which wouldn't be half bad if they hadn't now also limited the cocktail options to the typical mimosa and bellini. Kiss goodbye to the 6 intriguing cocktail choices we had read about. I think this may explain why there was literally nobody in the place at 1pm on a nice Sunday. A few other AYCD options in the area came to mind -- Bondi Road (the sister of Aussie Sunday-Funday spot Sunburnt Cow), the Sixth Ward and Tre. We passed a number of other brunch spots on the way down and I snapped a few shots. Some observations: Essex was packed as always ($16 nets you 3+ bloodys, mimosas or screwdrivers + brunch item -- tons of choices and the chicken fried steak is mind-blowing -- cash only). Spitzer's was surprisingly packed given that there is no complimentary brunch drink offered -- yet further proof of the beer revolution taking place in the city. Thor was dead despite their pretty good brunch deal -- menu item, coffee and 2 brunch cocktails for $18. Schiller's was wall-to-wall and spilling out into the streets despite no free brunch cocktail(s). And the Fat Hippo was dead. The Stanton Social was not nearly as busy as I remember it being -- you're not that hip anymore, give brunchers a free friggin' drink. Bondi Road was packed (the $18 AYCD option still pulls 'em in -- cash only) and it was a 30-minute wait just to sit at the bar. The Sixth Ward ($14 for brunch item + unlimited mimosa) was empty and we found the menu to be a bit limited. So we settled on Tre and its $17 AYCD brunch (cash only) that includes bellini, mimosa or champagne + a brunch item. The champagne was light and refreshing and my potato pancakes (pic below) were just like Nana used to make (ok, not really but they were still pretty damn good). Jill went with the two eggs with tomato pepper salsa and smoked mozzarella (pic below) which she enjoyed, but I got the feeling she wished they had a build-your-own omelette option. Overall, Tre is a helluva brunch deal. We had 4 glasses of champagne each and 2 tasty brunch items for just about 40 bucks. The service was friendly and efficient. While not quite Yerba Buena good in terms of either the food or cocktails, we will definitely be back and would recommend Tre as an AYCD brunch spot to anyone. .gallery { margin: auto; } .gallery-item { float: left; margin-top: 10px; text-align: center; width: 33%; } .gallery img { border: 2px solid #cfcfcf; } .gallery-caption { margin-left: 0; } $14 AYCD Brunch + Beer Garden at The Sixth Ward Spitzer's still busy even though no free brunch drink More like \"Permanent Construction\" Awesome that Macondo on Houston has bar seats on the street like this ...and they give you a complimentary brunch drink! Grab a pierogi if you're starving while waiting for Prune Essex = Packed You would be crazier if you sold a slice for 75 cents Hey Fat Hippo - you want free advice to fill empty brunch tables -- give a free effen drink! Nice brunch crowd at Cafe Charbon despite no free brunch cocktail. Great specials at The Blue Seats Even a Sports Bar Has Bahn Mi Sliders These Days the only signage at Cube 63 is the mail slot Heard some good things about the drinks at this LES pan-latino From what we've heard, more like \"NAY-burrito\" Delicious Potato Pancakes at Tre The 2 eggs with salsa and smoked mozzarella were good, too.

agree that 6th Ward has limited menu but man is it perfect for a hangover....nothing like loads of pan grease and mimosas to clear your head on a sun afternoon.

I would also like to suggest Tapeo 29. It can be a bit dark at times if the curtains/windows are closed, but they have a really tasty menu and good brunch deals....unlimited Bloodies, mimosas, or screwdrivers (as well as tea or coffee) with your meal that are all around $15.00.

We love Tapeo 29. Never been for brunch though. We'll definitely hit up their AYCD soon. Sounds like a great deal.

100% Halal & Healthy Cart Has a Sister Cart at 54th and Park...With Fresh Tilapia and Fried Shrimp

***CONTENT
When speaking last week with Gamal, who runs the 100% Healthy & Halal Cart at 55th and Park -- home of my favorite street cart salad, I found out that he also owns and operates the Halal Cart at 54th and Park. He told me he gives his guys over there 100% freedom in terms of coming up with menu items and the food preparation. I guess he's not a control freak. He told me they're doing some good and different stuff over there and that I should check 'em out. It being beautiful yesterday I decided to give it a shot. I was pretty surprised by some of their offerings. The guys mentioned that their cart is pretty busy even though they haven't received as much online publicity as Gamal over the past 6 months. They said they were going to put together a combination for me with \"a little bit of everything\" so I could get a good sampling of what they can do (low res pic not included). The first thing I noticed is that these guys do their rice several different ways -- regular, spicy, as well as a few other flavor combinations. I went with the spicy rice. I also coudn't help but notice the lightly breaded fish and fried shrimp sitting above the grill. I asked about the fish and was assured that it was as fresh as any tilapia I could find. The fish and shrimp is certainly a differentiator for this cart. The fish was indeed fresh, as promised (at least it tasted fresh) and there was a seasoning in the lightly fried exterior that I really enjoyed but could not place. I'm gonna have to ask them what it is the next time I stop by. The fried shrimp was also fresh and good (though I must confess I'm not a huge fried shrimp fan). Another differentiator is their side of jalapeno pickles (that's what they called it, though it seemd to comprise more pickles than jalapenos) - this side comes free with all combination platters. It didn't have a massive kick that I was expecting and that I would have liked, but the pickles were in some sort of light, clear sauce that made them pretty damn tasty. Also in my \"kitchen sink\" combination, they threw in some lamb and onions, as well as a falafel, that were sitting on the grill cooking when I walked up. Nothing too special here, really. Good, but probably no better than the lamb and onions you're going to get at any other Halal cart in the city. Last but not least, I tried some grilled eggplant. Can't say I've seen eggplant like this being offered at too many carts, and it was great. The big negative for me as far as this street cart goes was in the \"sauce\" category. The white sauce really had nothing much to it and the only thing they had in terms of hot sauce was a runny, tabasco-ey sauce. They did mention a thick, spicy green sauce that they usually have but had run out of yesterday. Overall, I was pretty impressed with the fish (probably more so by the fact that they even had fish than the actual fish itself, though it was seasoned quite nicely) and the rice variety. They need to get some thick hot sauce like Gamal has, though, or next time I'm gonna have to stop by the 100% Halal & Healthy on my way back to the office to load up.

So, we just heard about yet another Restaurant Week here in NYC. This one is actually more like an NYC restaurant week competition. In fact, they're calling it the Signature Dish Contest. It's all a part of the Continental Airlines International Restaurant Week in New York City from May 1-10th and it's being hosted by none other than Tom Colicchio. Click here to watch Tom present an overview of the Signature Dish Contest. Continental Airlines has assembled 12 different NYC restaurants that represent 12 different countries around the world. Each of the 12 restaurants will create a signature dish and serve it to diners between May 1-1oth (see each participating restaurant's signature dish after the jump). After trying one or more of the signature dishes at participating restaurants, diners are encouraged to then visit the Continental Airlines International Restaurant Week website to provide their feedback and ratings. Chef Colicchio will then take all of the ratings and let us know the top 3 signature dishes voted on by diners. Continental has actually landed some pretty big name restaurants -- Allen & Delancey, Boqueria, Del Posto, Nobu, and Tabla, to name a few. Also, this Restaurant Week offers diners behind the scenes access to some of the restaurants. For example, diners at Delmonico's will get a personal tour of the kitchen, diners at Del Posto will get a tour of the extensive wine cellar, and diners at Tabla will get a tour of Floyd Cardoz's kitchen. Here's a list of the participating restaurants, and their offers.

Andy and I found ourselves in Greenwich Village last Friday night after work and we decided to stop in for some happy hour drinks at Bar Blanc Bistro at 142 West 10th Street (b/t Greenwich Ave. and Waverly Place). We had heard about the amazing happy hour special at the bar - 50% off the entire bar menu (not including burger or oysters) and 50% off all cocktails, beer and wines (by the glass/carafe). We had wanted to check out the new bistro décor and menu, and there was no better opportunity to take a test drive than with the 50% off happy hour (from 6-8 pm now extended through Friday the 17th). It's not a huge bar, so get there early to snag yourself a seat. This is really one of those deals that can't be missed. I started off with a glass of wine while Andy found himself a Peak Organic Pale Ale. We ordered the \"Bitter Ballen\" Braised Beef Ragout Croquettes with Dijon Mustard ($8 = $4 happy hour special), the Duck Liver Mousse with Toasts ($10 = $5 happy hour special), and the Macaroni Cheese Au Gratin with Black Truffle ($9 = $4.50 happy hour special). Our favorite was the mac n' cheese, but everything really exceeded our expectations. The mac n' cheese was bursting with truffle flavor and the sauce was a perfect creamy consistency. It was the best I've had in ages. The duck liver mousse was just what I was in the mood for and it came with some tasty pickled vegetables. The little balls of braised beef ragout (like brisket inside a pastry) were tasty and perfectly crispy on the outside, but the added flavor of the Dijon smeared underneath really kicked them up a notch. Next time, I am certainly ordering the White Bean and Olive Tapenade Crostini ($7 = $3.50 happy hour special) AND the Fries with Dutch Fry Sauce with additional dipping sauce options (I want to try out the Indian curry spice and the Kaffir lime) ($6 = $3 happy hour special with extra sauces for $1). I know Andy will be ordering the Bar Blanc Burger with Vermont Clothbound Cheddar, Homemade Pickles, Bone Marrow Bordelaise Mayo and Fries. We saw one go by and he almost jumped out of his seat to follow it. Although we had only intended to stop in for a few drinks and a couple of appetizers, we were so impressed by the food (and by the fabulous service, good vibe, and fun music selections) that we had to stay and try out an entrée. Although the dinner menu was not 50% off, the food was well worth its cost. We ordered the Hudson Valley Moulard duck chop with faro, vanilla braised leeks, and natural jus ($29) - gorgeously tender meat, perfectly cooked, and spot-on accompaniments. We also ordered the sautéed Brussels sprout leaves with bacon and apple puree ($8) - so savory and perfectly balanced with the tender cubed bacon (also nice to have as a lighter dish with just the leaves instead of the full dense sprout). Go for the 50% happy hour deal, but if you end up staying for dinner you certainly will not be disappointed. Here's the menu: Bar Menu Crostini with White Bean and Olive Tapenade 7 Ham and Fontina Cheese Croquettes with Smoked Paprika Aoili 7 Duck Liver Mousse with Toasts 10 Pancetta Wrapped Sardine with Fresh Basil 8 Macaroni Cheese Au Gratin 7 with Applewood Smoked Bacon 8 or Black Truffle 9 Home Made Country Terrine, Cornichons, Toasts 10 Market Oysters 2.95 each Fries with Dutch Fry Sauce 6 Add’l Dipping Sauce 1 Indian Curry Spice Chipotle Mayo Honey Mustard Blanc Burger, Vermont Cheddar, Homemade Pickles, Bone Marrow Bordelaise Mayo, Fries 15 Chef’s Selection of Cheese 14 Bistro Menu (PLUS SEASONAL MARKET SPECIALS) Hors D’Oeuvres Crostini with White Bean Purée and Olive Tapenade 7 Duck Liver Mousse with Toasts 10 Pancetta Wrapped Sardine, Fresh Basil 8 Ham and Fontina Cheese Croquettes, Smoked Paprika Aoili 7 Home Made Country Terrine with Cornichons, Toasts 10 Market Oysters 2.95 each Appetizers BABY BOSTON LETTUCE AND HEARTS OF PALM SALAD 12 Poached Egg, Aged Pecorino Cheese, Balsamic Vinegar Oil LIGHTLY CURED KONA KANPACHI 12 Anchovy Yogurt, Fresh Cucumber, Celery, Sea Beans CRISPY SWEETBREAD AND BERKSHIRE PORK BELLY SALAD 15 Lentils, Chorizo, Watercress, Fennel Slaw, Sherry Vinegar SEARED MAINE DAY BOAT SCALLOPS 18 Curried Carrots, House Cured Lardo, Bibb Lettuce Sauce SOUP DU JOUR SEASONAL MARKET SALAD Entrées SEARED BLACK COD 26 Wilted Arrowleaf Spinach, Celery Root, Fennel, Saffron Sauce, Salt Cod Brandade LOCH DUART SALMON 26 Braised Escarole, Roasted Radish, Chesnut - White Wine Sauce SLOW ROASTED ALL NATURAL CHICKEN BREAST 26 Parsnip, Comte Gnocchi, Leg Meat Confit, Black Truffle SLOW ROASTED DUROC PORK LOIN 30 House Made Sauerkraut-Braised Pork Shoulder Terrine Grainy Mustard Sauce SIDES 8 MACARONI CHEESE AU GRATIN 7 Add: Applewood Smoked Bacon 8 Black Truffle 9 SAUTÉED BRUSSELS SPROUT LEAVES WITH BACON, APPLE PURÉE 8 SAUTÉED BABY BOK CHOY WITH BACON 8 CAULIFLOWER AU GRATIN with Gruyère Cheese 8 ROAST FINGERLING POTATOES 7 FRIES WITH DUTCH FRY SAUCE 6 Add’l Dipping Sauces 1 Indian Curry Spice, Chipotle Mayo, Honey Mustard, CHEF’S SELECTION OF CHEESE 14

We just heard about a new monthly wine tasting party called \"Wine Down.\" The first one's coming up Wednesday April 22nd at 7pm and it's being held on the spacious fourteenth floor terrace at Charlie Palmer's Astra in Midtown (979 3rd Ave b/t 58th and 59th). The \"Wine Down\" parties are being hosted by Michael Green, the wine and spirits consultant for Gourmet Magazine. The tickets are $40, which gets you a selection of wines and passed hors d'oeuvres supervised by Chef Charlie Palmer, himself. According to the event info we came across, the mission of \"Wine Down\" is to bring together a cool space, terrific food, bodacious wines, fun music and great people. Sounds pretty good to us.

15% Off Tuesdays at Astor Wines: Chile

2009-04-14 09:58:00
***CONTENT
Every Tuesday, Astor Wines (Lafayette @ E. 4th) picks a region or type of wine, spirit, or saké and marks it down 15%. Today, they have selected our favorite value wine region -- Chile. Check out the deals here. We love the crisp, citrusy Sauvignon Blancs, the reds made from Carmenère, a distinctively spicy French grape abundant in Chilean vineyards, and the big Cabernet Sauvignons. In fact, Wine Spectator's #1 Wine of 2008 was a 96-point Chilean red -- Casa Lapostolle's Clos Apalta Colchagua Valley 2005 (a blend of Chile's Carmenère variety, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon). We recommend stocking up on the following wines from Astor. Casa Lapostolle Sauvignon Blanc - 2008 (Rapel) for $8.49/bottle. Just named Wine Spectator's Wine of the Week and they list the price as $11 making this one a great deal. Errazuriz Merlot Estate - 2007 for $8.49/bottle. We love the Errazuriz Carmenere and we're guessing the Merlot is pretty special, too. Santa Rita Cabernet Sauvignon, Reserva for $11.04/bottle. This is a solid cabernet at this price point. Terra Noble Gran Reserva Carmenère - 2007 for $12.74/bottle. Haven't tried this one, but have heard good things.

Jim Lahey Seeks Apprentice: Must Respond Well to Criticism

The news making the rounds today is of Jim Lahey's Chodorow-esque tirade in the Observer in response to Frank Bruni's lukewarm 1-star review of his 3-month old fad pizza joint Co. (bankrolled by Jean-Georges). We came across this interesting CraigsList posting earlier titled \"Apprentice Needed for Jim Lahey\". It appears that the \"master craftsman\", himself, is seeking an apprentice, excuse me, I mean \"he needs an apprentice,\" in his workshop (really, he's calling this person an 'apprentice' -- that right there should tell you something about Lahey's ego). Here's the full posting: \"Jim Lahey from Sullivan Street Bakery is looking for an Apprentice. A high-profile innovator in the field of bread-making is seeking an apprentice. The right candidate will have a culinary background, be passionate about food, able to follow instructions, anticipate his needs and be proactive in executing tasks. He/she must be responsible, focused, hard working, organized, savvy, and ready to hit the ground running. Knowledge of Manhattan and a willingness to travel are also expected. This is a great opportunity for the right individual to get hands-on experience working at one of the best bakeries in the city, as well as a popular, quality-driven, new bread themed restaurant.\" All we want to know is: Is the right candidate expected to be able to handle criticism well?

Research shows that drinking wine is good for your heart. But you probably didn't know that drinking wine could be good for other people's hearts, too. On Tuesday April 21st from 6-8:30pm, Wines of Portugal will be hosting their 5th Annual Wine Tasting in New York City at City Winery, featuring 40 wineries and 300 wines from all of Portugal's main wine regions. 100% OF ALL PROCEEDS FROM TICKET SALES will be donated to WOMENHEART, benefiting the research, education, and promotion of women's heart health. Sample Portugal's remarkable range, from Vinho Verde's refreshing whites to the Duoro's passionate reds, to Alentejo's new classics and beyond. Tickets are only $40 and can be purchased in advance by clicking here. If you haven't had a chance to check out the new City Winery space, this would be a great opportunity. City Winery is Manhattan's first winery in 40 years. But it's much more than just a winery. The space also houses a world-class wine bar, live music venue, VIP lounge, cellar dining room, and private event areas. Jill and I have had a chance to taste several Portuguese wines over the past few months and have been loving what we've tried at all price points. This is one burgeoning wine region you will certainly be hearing alot more from over the next few years.

This picture and description of the Greek Easter celebration next weekend at Estiatorio MILOS just came through our inbox with the subject line \"18 lambs roasting in Midtown.\" This sounds deliciously sadistic: \"The intoxicating aroma of roast lambs will drift down the streets of Midtown from the patio of Estiatorio MILOS during the entire weekend of Greek Easter, April 18 & 19. Centered around food, family, and rebirth, Easter is by far the most important holiday of the entire year in the Greek Orthodox community. MILOS owner Costas Spilliadis will host a lavish feast to break the 48-day Lenten meat fast with roasted lambs, a tradition originating from his native Peloponnese. The festivities will begin at 6 p.m. on Saturday, April 18 when twelve lambs will be slow-roasted on spits right outside the restaurant, while the cooks continuously baste them with branches of rosemary dipped in olive oil. The Saturday meal begins just after midnight mass. The dining room will be lit with candles in ecclesiastical fashion to commemorate the Resurrection. Baskets of eggs dyed a deep red symbolizing life will adorn the tables. The red eggs will be knocked together at the phrase, “Hristos Anesti” (Christ is risen). For those unable to attend the feast on the eve of Greek Easter, six additional lambs will be roasted on Greek Easter Sunday. On Sunday, April 19 the menu will be available à la carte for $35.\"

Happy Birthday Elettaria! Welcome to the Recession. Fresh off of Eater's \"One Year In\" feature earlier this week, we learned this morning that Elettaria (8th St. @ MacDougal) has launched a recession special: Sunday to Wednesday we offer our special 3-course tasting menu for $33. $8 adds 2 pours of our custom Sangria (red or white) or Rum Punch. Elettaria is already known to have one of the best happy hour specials in town, not to mention its drink menu was created by folks at Death & Co. and Freemans. From 5 p.m. to 7 p.m. everyday, you can get $8 glasses of wine, $4 beers, and $7 cocktails. They also have some pretty creative homemade bar snacks that include a special hot dog, a take on crab rangoon and a naan pizza is in the works. As to the success of the happy hour special, they tell Eater: \"People are coming in to drink and hang out and it's just kind of fun. People want to drink right after work these days more than ever. Some come in and get wrecked from 5 - 7.\" We'll test the dinner special (after a few half-off cocktails, of course) and we'll let you know what we think.

I'm feeling a bit under the weather today, and it being the first night of Passover, I decided to treat myself to a little Carnegie Deli for lunch. I went with my go-to sandwich -- the Woody Allen. This behemoth is a combination corned beef and pastrami sandwich and was given its name after the deli served as a filming location for Broadway Danny Rose. I always order it with extra slices of rye bread cause there's no way 2 slices of bread can suffice for the close to 3lbs. of pastrami and corned beef that are included. I don't know if it's because today is a Jewish holiday, but I've never seen them make the sandwich so big. It was easily twice the size of the pastrami sandwich that Serious Eats dubbed the \"mother cell\" and used to make 5 \"daughter\" sandwiches. Check out their \"mother cell\" here. I'm telling you I could easily make 8 generously-sized sandwiches from this monstrosity of a sandwich. I even had to tape the top slice of rye bread down to snap a photo.

Better yet, head to Halfsteak/Craftsteak in some baby blue, where, according to Grub Street, “Long time Carolina fan Tom Colicchio will be at Halfsteak tonight watching the championship game. Every time Carolina hits a 3-pointer, the Crafty chef will give a free drink to anyone wearing Carolina blue.” If you're in Brooklyn, may we suggest heading over to South 4th Bar & Cafe in Williamsburg for \"Sixpointopia\" where 2 Sixpoint beers will square off against each other for the title of Sixpoint champion. The winner is determined by which keg runs dry first. All beers are $4.

The '50% Off Bar Check' Special at Ammos is Completely Legit

Jill and I decided to head over to Ammos Estiatorio (Vanderbilt & 45th St) last night for a drink and bite to eat before meeting friends for a drink at The Ginger Man. We were intrigued by the Monday & Friday Recession Special that we originally heard about through Eater's Dealfeed: 50% off your entire bar check, including food and alcohol. We wanted to see for ourselves whether it's actually what it says it is or if there are any catches or limitations. We called ahead (always advisable when you are going somewhere for a special deal) and they told us the deal was still on between 5-9pm on Mondays and Fridays for people sitting in in the bar area. We arrived and were pretty excited to see a couple of open tables around the bar. The bar tables at Ammos are actually quite large. You could probably squeeze in four people. A placard on the table re-confirmed for us the 50% off special. The waiter brought us 2 dinner menus and it was game-on. Jill ordered a glass of Greek wine (Moschofilero-Roditis) that the server likened to a Sauvignon Blanc and I ordered an Anchor Steam beer. Factoring in the special, her glass of wine was $5 and my beer was $3.50. For food, we ordered the Crudo for 2, Koupes (ground beef and lamb, bulgur wheat, lemon and yogurt), and Octapodi (grilled octopus, fennel, onion, red wine vinegar and olive oil). The after-special price of the crudo was $10, the koupes was $5 and the grilled octopus was $8.50. The crudo was fresh and delicious and was adorned with capers, citrus, lemon, and chilies. We also loved the grilled octopus which was as tasty as it was generously apportioned. The koupes was our least favorite of the three dishes, though it was not bad at all. We agreed it could have used a bit more of the yogurt sauce. Our bill came out to $34.50 which is a terrific deal for 2 drinks and 3 dishes. We definitely recommend this 50% off special, which can also be enjoyed on Friday nights between 5-9pm. Crudo Grilled Octopus Koupes (ground beef and lamb)

Red Newt's Dave Whiting Responds to Death of NY Wine Bill
***AUTHOR
Andy
***DATE
2009-03-31 09:47:00
***CONTENT
According to this story on Crains, the proposed bill that would have allowed grocery stores to obtain a license to sell wine is DOA. Looks like the powerful liquor store lobby won out this time around. I think this is a huge loss for NY wine consumers. I was in a Publix in Florida this past weekend and it had an amazing wine section. The increased competition for wine and liquor stores would not necessarily have been a bad thing in my opinion. Dave Whiting, winemaker and co-owner of Red Newt Cellars Winery & Bistro in the Finger Lakes wine region, left us the following comment in response to the news out of Albany. He explains how the death of the wine bill is not only bad for NY wine consumers, but bad for the entire wine industry of NY state: Thanks for your post. I have made some additional comments on this issue that I would like to share with you.... I continue to believe selling wine in grocery stores, alongside food with which it pairs so well, is the best way to introduce new consumers to the appreciation of healthy, responsible consumption of wine with their meals. In failing to pass this measure, we may have missed our opportunity to greatly increase the number of New Yorkers who enjoy wine in this way on a regular basis and have hence restricted our opportunity to grow as an industry. I agree that there are many great wine shops in the state that provide excellent selection and service to their customers. Many of these shops sell our wines. Over the past few days I have received many emails from wine shops who suggest that grocery stores will only carry cheap, low quality wines and will be unable to provide knowledgeable wine service. Then, in nearly the same breath, I hear the cry that the very grocery stores that fail to provide the great selection and service that wine drinkers have come to expect from their local wine shops, are going to take away their customers. This is a perspective on marketing that I don't understand. Even if the grocery store wine selection and service is abysmal as I am lead to believe by some, the grocery store setting will provide a level of convenience that will introduce new customers to the enjoyment of wine. The wine shops will have a competitive advantage to retain their current customers as well as the opportunity to engage a growing customer base. My view on this issue in not borne of a selfish desire to grow my business at the expense of others'. It comes from my desire to grow and expand the wine industry of New York State; from growers, to wineries, to wholesalers, to stores (liquor stores AND grocery stores), to the consumer. The loser that we must not forget is the grower. The grape industry in the New York is facing the most catastrophic downturn since the 1970's. Without a substantial increase in customer base and sales, I will be forced to make drastic cuts to growers who I have worked closely with for the past ten years. But it's not just me. And it's not just the boutique, family wineries that we need to think about. Many thousands of tons of grapes are likely to drop in the vineyards this fall. These are the grapes that would have gone to some of the very large wineries in New York and into the mainstream wines that likely would have been common on most grocery store shelves. These wines don't come from huge, corporate wineries. They come from farms. They come from families who have worked for decades and generations to build the agricultural communities that make up the grape growing regions of New York State. When I speak about this issue, I'm not just talking about a bottle wine and who gets the buck for selling it. I speak the voice of our farms, and our families. And I hope for the day when we can work as an industry to grow and flourish together. Thanks. David Whiting winemaker, co-owner Red Newt Cellars Winery & Bistro

Thanks to a commenter, we just learned about a pretty good boozy brunch deal at Thor (the restaurant and lounge in the Hotel on Rivington). Guess it kind of makes sense for them to have a good deal given its proximity to Essex's infamous 3-cocktail brunch. The special $18 prix-fixe gets you a choice of an entree, coffee/tea and two cocktails (choice of bellini, bloody mary, mimosa or screwdriver). And if you're looking to make it an all-out Sunday-Funday boozefest, you can get additional drinks for just $5 each. The brunch menu has some intriguing entree choices, including a brioche lobster roll, baked merguez and egg ratatouille, and a croque 'monsieur' or 'madame'. If boozing it up on Sundays is your thing, click here to see Wined & Dined's Complete Boozy Brunch Guide. We also noticed what seems to be a pretty good Easter Brunch deal at Thor. Details and menu follow... EASTER SUNDAY BRUNCH $ 39.00 PER PERSON 3-COURSE MENU Including 2 Brunch Cocktails ( Mimosa – Belini – Bloody Mary ) & Coffee · Russ&Daughter “ Nova “ smoked salmon, crème fraiche, watercress, Apple Sweet peas & white mushroom soup with truffle oil Roasted beet & baby arugula salad “ Mimosa “ Mixed baby green, gourmand dressing Tuna tartar with avocado & flour tortilla chips Endive salad with blue cheese, walnut, pear, scallion, mustard dressing “ Fisher island “ East coast oyster, black pepper mignonette Buffalo mozzarella & vine ripe tomato salad, balsamic, olive oil, basil · Lamb loin stuffed & roasted, flageolets au jus, baked provencal tomato Flat iron steak & eggs any style, fingerling home fries, baby greens Fresh lobster roll, heart of romaine with green vegetables Pan fried Atlantic salmon, scrambled eggs, grilled asparagus, fingerling home fries Brioche French toast with mango & strawberries, raisin caramel sauce Eggs Benedict, baby Greens, fingerling home fries Smoked salmon salad, string beans, beets, poached egg, orange & grapefruit, mustard dressing “ L’Hambourgeois “ Organic beef burger with cheese, Truffled French fries · Easter bunny surprise dessert Fresh fruit plate with passion fruit sorbet Warm flourless chocolate cake White chocolate cheese cake

This just came through from our friend Jeff: Excerpt from an article on CNN.com today. Thought of you guys. For Manhattan restaurateur Paul Grieco, sticking to good food and the warm, hospitable philosophy of his East Village restaurant, Hearth, is key to devising dining promotions to combat a 20 percent dip in business from the same period last year. \"Every restaurant out there is leading with the discount, and the consumer -- it's become one big blur. We're all competing against each other -- none of us are coming out winners,\" Grieco said. To differentiate Hearth this winter, Grieco and the restaurant's chef created five winter soups available at the bar for $5 each, paired with $5 glasses of sherry. This spring, Grieco plans to offer $5 spring salads. Hearth's Cucina Povera, a rustic $35 three-course, prix fixe meal featuring entrees such as braised lamb shank, is another offer aimed at budget-conscious diners.

Should We Be Allowed to Buy Wine in NY Grocery Stores? The Debate Heats Up in Albany
***AUTHOR
Andy
***DATE
2009-03-26 09:41:00
***CONTENT
Should wine be sold in New York grocery stores? That is the million (perhaps mult-million) dollar question that has been stirring up quite a heated debate over the past few months. And it seems to be coming to a head this week in the state capitol as the April 1 deadline rapidly approaches for approving the budget. Ostensibly, the purpose of the proposal is to raise loads of money for the state, which has been feeling the pain of the recession in a major way. In his 2009 budget, Gov. David A. Paterson has proposed allowing grocery stores to sell wine as a means of raising money through licensing fees. He also proposed almost tripling the excise tax on wine sold in New York. Grocers, of course, favor the proposal that would allow them to sell wine in their aisles. Mom-and-pop wine and liquor stores are vehemently opposed as they believe it would lead to the eventual demise of the local wine shop. They predict that more than 1,000 of New York’s 2,700 liquor stores would go out of business. In fact, liquor stores are so threatened by the proposal that many owners have, in turn, purportedly threatened local NY wineries with boycotts if they publicly support the proposal. According to a story on Lenndevours, a blog that focuses on local NY wineries, the owner of Fox Run Vineyards in the Finger Lakes received threats after he came out in Albany in support of the bill back in early February. He received the following email from an angry wine shop owner in Troy, NY: I saw you on the news yesterday. Thanks for trying to put me out of business. I used to like pushing your wines but now just looking at them makes me want to puke. I'll never sell any of your wines ever again! When we beat this proposal I hope it's you that goes under. Whether because they felt threatened or otherwise, the vast majority of NY wineries are against Governor Paterson's proposal. A couple of wineries, including Fox Run and Red Newt Cellars in the Finger Lakes, have openly supported the proposal. I personally do not believe that wine in grocery stores will necessarily sound the death knell for local wine and liquor stores. Grocery stores will likely be stocking their shelves with mass-produced wines that will reach more of the masses. As a wine consumer, I can perhaps see myself buying a bottle every now and then in a grocery for convenience sake, but it's not going to change my current wine buying habits, which include online purchases with free shipping, purchases during winery visits and purchases from my local wine shop. This proposal, if passed, would bring wine to the masses in the same way that Wal-Mart and Costco brought flat-screens and other consumer electronics to the masses. Wine shops see what happened to Circuit City and are terrified. However, wine is different than electronics. Unless you are a gizmo or gadget nut, a flat-screen is a flat-screen is a flat-screen. Wine is a much different industry. I think local wine shops can still prosper and even gain market share if they position themselves and stock their shelves correctly. They will need to push their level of service with smart recommendations and procure and sell smaller production wines that don't make it to the grocery stores. While large production wineries are for the proposal in the same way that large grocery stores favor it, small wineries such as NY ones in Long Island and the Finger Lakes are against it. Small production wines need wine shops since groceries will likely not stock their wines due to the price-points. We received an email last night from Red Newt Cellars. David Whiting, winemaker/co-owner of Red Newt, has been in Albany all week listening to the debate and expressed his thoughts on the topic: \"I have been spending some time in Albany for the past few days talking, but mostly listening, to all sides of the very hot issue of permitting the sale of wine in grocery stores. I would like to share some of my thoughts with you on this issue, which holds the potential to be transformational in the economy of upstate New York, and in New York as a whole. One of the points that I will stress is that this is issue is being hotly debated and will likely be decided in a matter of days. If you have an opinion about it, you have the opportunity today to have your voice make a difference. This opportunity will be gone very soon. So act TODAY! (Read more... for some help.) Wine and food go well together and are truly are an example of what I, and many others, consider a healthy, responsible lifestyle. The convenience of being able to walk into a grocery store and purchase a bottle of wine would be very helpful for my family and my customers, and would help boost sales of wine in New York State. But I believe that the question of selling wines in grocery stores is more than just an issue of retail sales. It's not just an issue of who sells more -- the liquor store or the grocery store -- or about who \"wins\". This is an agricultural and economic issue that has holds the future of the NY economy in the balance. Permitting the sales of wine in grocery stores will increase the overall sales of wine in New York State: this effect is very well documented in other states where this has happened. When I talk about boosting wine sales, I'm not just talking about selling more wine to the same group of customers. I'm talking about engaging an expanded set of wine consumers who, when presented with the opportunity and convenience of purchasing wine that is sold along side food, will adopt a routine that involves more frequent enjoyment of the health, social and gustatory benefits that come along with the responsible consumption of wine with their meals. There are two types of sales that are essential to the success of any business. 1) Repeat sales to existing customers and 2) sales to new customers. I do believe that most liquor stores do a good job at culturing loyal customers who find value in the goods and services that they provide. But the fact that nearly 50% of New York State liquor stores have gone out of business in the past 20 years and that the current trend is to lose an additional 50 - 60 stores per year reinforces the idea that there may be a shortage of new customers. If we consider the Farm Wineries of New York, we have seen tremendous growth with the number of wineries from about 150 wineries five years ago to over 260 today. And many of the wineries have shown annual growth in the double digits for the the past decade. In order to do this, we have prioritized our customers, both repeat customers and new customers, and grown an extensive customer base that has created \"pull\" in the retail markets (liquor stores) who carry NY wines. The grocery store setting provides a unique opportunity to present wines to potential consumers in an atmosphere accompanying food, and at a time when that wine can be purchased for direct and immediate involvement in the preparation enjoyment of the meal at hand. Many of the best grocers already embrace the \"eat local\" philosophy and will embrace drinking locally as well. This is a plus, but not the only concern when it comes to marketing NY wines. All wines, regardless of origin, that are sold in this venues will help to build our novice wine drinkers in the food and wine culture, and to create new wine consumers. And, while the sale of NY wines has the biggest economic bang for the buck, wines produced outside of NY still contribute to the suffering NY state economy. That large body of new consumers will not be strangers to the wineries or the liquor stores. Anyone familiar with how people are introduced to and enjoy wine realize that one's taste in wine is anything but static. Invariably the novice wine consumer will be satisfied with a handful of wines that he or she first enjoys for a while. But before long, curiosity and exploration takes hold and leads the consumer to new styles and varieties of wines, and to new outlets. These outlets include the grocery store, the winery, and the wine shop. The economic effects of increased sales by NY wineries is far reaching. It reaches even farther than the obvious scope the wineries and the stores. The growers who grow the grapes, the supplier who sells the tractors, wire, posts. The fabricator who makes the tanks and cellar equipment. The supplier who provides bottles, corks and labels. The list goes on. Increased sales means not only more tax money but more economic prosperity all around. My final point: This issue is being hotly debated in Albany. And the decision will be extremely close. If you have longed for the time that you can express your political voice in a way that is truly heard, the time is now. I would encourage you to at least contact your local legislators (you can use the link below to send an email). But keep in mind, it is not only the representatives of your own district, but all of the legislators that need to hear your voice. Your voice is important, but it does not trickle down the hallways of the capital. Your voice needs to be heard, loud and clear, in each office. There are a lot of people in the capital that value your voice. To make your effort a little more manageable, I'm including a list below of some of the select people who most need to hear what you have to say. Governor Paterson 518-474-8390 Senator Malcolm Smith 518-455-2701 Senator Valesky 518-455-2838 Senator Aubertine 518-455-2761 Senator Stakowski 518-455-2426 Senator Foley 518-455-2303 Assemblyman Magee 518-455-4807 Speaker Silver 518-455-3791 Assemblywoman Christensen 518-455-5383 Assemblyman Parment 518-455-4511 Assemblywoman Lifton 518-455-5444 Assemblyman Canestrari 518-455-4474 Assemblywoman DelMonte 518-455-5284 Assemblywoman Eddington 518-455-4901 Assemblywoman Markey 518-455-4755 Assemblywoman Galef 518-455-5348 Assemblywoman Rosenthal 518-455-5802 Assemblyman Farrell 518-455-5491 Assemblywoman Jacobs 518-455-5385 Assemblyman Schimminger 518-455-4767 Some of the points that you may find important and want to express... *NYS is 3rd in the nation for wine & grape production, but 46th in the nation per capita for the number of outlets to sell wine *Wine in grocery stores does not put liquor stores out of business, in fact in the states that allow it, there are more liquor stores than in NYS *Selling wine in grocery stores will increase sales of wine by creating NEW wine drinkers who will patronize grocery stores, wineries and liquor stores. *35 other states allow the sale of wine in grocery stores. *NYS is the only major grape growing state that does not allow the sale of wine in grocery stores. *The number of liquor stores is decreasing in NYS by 60-80 per year *There are only 2500 liquor stores left in NYS. California has 27,000 outlets to sell wine. North Carolina has 13,072 outlets *Suppliers like tank manufacturers, label printers, bottle distributors, vineyard suppliers are all planning to expand and add jobs if NYS allows the sale of wine in food stores Thanks.

i go down to florida and it's so nice to buy wine in the same stop when we are loading up our condo with groceries. we don't see it here in ny, but they are starting to package wine in all sorts of new and interesting ways...think small formats like you get on airplanes are being sold in 4 and 6-pack fashion as are some smaller type box wines. i even saw a wine that is being sold in what looks like a Capri-Sun pacjage.

We just received an email informing us that the $24 lunch deal of the century continues at Cafe Boulud...and it looks like its continuing Tuesday through Saturday all year long. In addition to 3-courses for $24, Cafe Boulud is also offering 4 different bottles of wine for $24.

We just got a submission about some great specials at Koreatown restaurant and lounge Third Floor Cafe. Expect a dark, lively and loud lounge with a packed elevator ride up and down. Great spot for a group. All-you-can-eat fried chicken and all-you-can-drink beer. Sounds like Koreatown's answer to a Nascar tailgate party. Jill and I have stopped in at a couple of these upstairs lounges in Koreatown and must say that we remember them serving big, potent drinks for about half the price of a typical Manhattan bar. May have to check this place out. Daily, 5pm-8pm $10 for an entree + free drink (wine or martini) On Tuesdays, 5pm-8pm $15 all you can eat and drink (beer) but get there early (before 6pm), otherwise, it's packed.

Omido Celebrates 2-Year Anniversary With $29.99 All-You-Can-Eat Sushi Special

Despite the damage that Midtown Lunch'ers did when testing out Yushi last week in all-you-can-eat fashion, sleek Midtown sushi spot Omido (designed by AvroKO) is offering an all-you-can-eat sushi special for $29.99 a person on Mondays-Wednesdays between 4-7pm through April 22nd. This deal is in celebration of Omido's 2nd anniversary and because, as Omido itself states, \"a bad economy calls for a great deal.\" For those worried that the special may be limited to all the California rolls you can eat, we've been informed that you can have your pick of anything form nigiri to special rolls like the \"Big Omido.\" There's no doubt that this is a great deal, and though the 4-7pm time seems a bit restrictive, it's ideal for pre-theater given its Broadway b/t 53rd and 54th St. location.

It's the best time of the year to be a sports fan. The Madness has descended upon us and we did a bit of legwork to help you find the right bar to catch all the hoops action.

if you're looking for a midtown bar that has the DirectTv package, don't go to Judge Roy Bean, Cassidy's or Whisky Trader. Best bet is to head to 2nd Ave spots in 50's or Black Finn. Or Johnny Utah's has it supposedly.

It seemed like it would never end. Many had gone as far as dubbing it \"Restaurant Year.\" But the end of Winter today also marks the official end of NYC's Winter Restaurant Week. We're really not that into Restaurant Week anyways to be honest. Unless your talking about a handful of top-tier, high-end restaurants, a $35 three-course prix-fixe is just not that good of a deal. Add a drink or two and then tax + tip and you're still talking $75 a person. If Restaurant Week is your thing, not to worry. Several restaurants are keeping the party going. Here are some of them. L’Absinthe - Extended permanently. Artisanal - Extended through end of 2009 for Lunch, Dinner, Sun Lunch, Sun Dinner. And Artisanal has agreed to offer a Cheese Plate (their bread and butter) as a dessert option. Asia de Cuba - Lunch, Dinner, Sun Dinner through March 31st. Cafe des Artistes - Extending through end of 2009 for Dinner, Sun Lunch, Sun Dinner.Restaurant Week diners can substitute a glass of wine for the dessert course. Center Cut - Extending Sun-Thurs through March 31st. Compass - Extends Restaurant Week menu permanently ($35 prix-fixe). Also extended the $39 3lb lobster special, too. Hudson Cafeteria - Extending Sun-Thurs through March 31st and Lunch Menu Mon-Fri through March 31st. JoJo - Extending $24 lunch/$35 dinner menu through end of 2009. Note that only available for dinner Mon-Fri 5:30-6:30 and again after 9:30 and all Sunday. Kobe Club - Extending Tues-Sat through March 31st. Kittichai - Lunch, Dinner, Sunday Lunch, Sunday Dinner. Extended through March 31, 2009. Oceana - Extended for Lunch and Dinner. through Spring 2009 and maybe longer (including Saturdays). Also have a great wine deal — get 20% off bottles up to $100 and 30% off bottles that are $100 or more. Olana - Extended through end of 2009 for lunch and dinner.

Here's a look at the menu: The Frugal Feast $25 three course menu Appetizer: pickled beets, gorgonzola, toasted pistachios OR “aroma” caesar salad, parmigiano reggiano, poached egg, sicilian anchovy Main: chicken “hamburghese”, royal trumpets, Satur Farms greens OR spaghetti chitarra, fire roasted cherry tomatoes, bottarga, pan grattato OR sicilian meatloaf, herbed polenta, sautéed spinach, red pepper pesto Dessert: gianduja panna cotta, homemade nocciola gelato OR cinnamon raisin bread pudding, citrus whipped cream, cinnamon anglaise

Thrillist writes today that a Gansevoort Hotel has just opened in Turks & Caicos. A visit to the website reveals that the hotel's restaurant and beach club is none other than Bagatelle, the Meatpacking District brunch spot that's known to get bumpin' on Saturdays. The hotel's spa services are provided by Exhale Spa. This follows the opening of a Nikki Beach Resort in Turks & Caicos early last year. Isn't the whole point of going on vacation to get away from New York?

It's my favorite time of the year! St. Patty's Day and the NCAA Tournament in the same week...it just doesn't get any better than this. Not to mention the fact that my Michigan Wolverines made the tourney for the first time since I was a senior there (1998). I'm not sure which bothers me more -- that Michigan's basketball program was in the toilet for so long OR that it's already been 11 years since I graduated college. And just when you're thinkin' March can't get any better, we get word from friend and beer aficionado Riki about The National IPA Championship. An IPA tournament with 64 entries and a bracket -- are you kidding me! This is genius. The tournament began back on February 22nd and is already down to the Final Four. Click here for the current bracket. Here's how the tourney is set up: 64 participating IPA's from across the nation were randomly selected (some ones you've likely heard of such as Stone IPA, Dogfish Head, Magic Hat HIPA, and Bear Republic Racer 5 as well as several regional IPA's you probably haven't ever come across); All judges are brewers. They are organized into panels of 3, and given the task of choosing the best IPA between two beers. The judges do not know what beers they are being served. The majority rules on the voting. A steward will serve the panel the two beers (Sample \"Alpha\" and Sample \"Beta\"). The beers are served in clean, small cylindrical glasses. Each sample will be a 3 ounce pour. Once the preferred IPA is chosen, the panel will move to the next sample. No panel will judge more than eight pairs. At the completion of the judging session, the names of the beers are revealed to the panels and audience at large. One thing Riki noticed in looking at the bracket after a couple of rounds is that many of her favorites (which coincidentally happen to be many of my favorites) were getting knocked out of the tourney early by relatively unknown IPA's, or \"cinderallas\". So Riki and her friend Kelly decided to set up a mini-tournament and made it their mission to locate some of the winning beers (many of which are very small production and not at all easy to get a hold of ) so they could determine for themselves whether they are really \"winners.\" In Riki's own words, \"Tracking these beers down proved quite difficult and in the end we found 2 that made it to the final 4, 1 that made it to the final 8 and 3 that made it to the final 16. To round out the numbers we are also adding to our mini-tournament 2 of our favorites. This Saturday afternoon we will engage in a blind tasting tournament of our 8 beers to determine which one we like best. Please join us and aid in the judging process. We are making this an afternoon drinking activity and expect to start the competition around 2:30 or 3pm.\" In fact, four of the beers are being shipped from a distributor in Oregon and are expected to arrive Friday. We'll keep our fingers crossed. We're pretty psyched to be taking part in this little tasting tourney and we'll keep you posted on our winners. The Championship Round of the actual tournament is taking place here in NYC on Saturday. Final Four March 21st New York City, NY Big Sky Brewing Big Sky IPA Game 61 Details Tyranena Brewing Bitter Woman IPA Championship Round March 21st New York City, NY Winner of 61 Game 63 Details Winner of 62 Final Four March 21st New York City, NY Laurelwood Brewing Workhorse IPA Game 62 Details Rogue Ales Yellow Snow IPA

When we first learned that Bloomingdale's was set to open an upscale burger joint called 'Flip' we wrote in a post titled \"Richard Blais is Gonna 'Flip'!\" back on Feb. 20th that we may have another one of those legal name battles on our hands. Blais had been hinting of an NYC location since July 2008. Just in case Blais and the team behind his Flip Burger Boutique in Atlanta hadn't heard the news, we also left the following comment on Blais' blog, TrailBlais, back on Feb. 20th: Wined & Dined said... If NYC is one of the locations slated for your expansion, you may need to do some proactive trademark and trade name protection. I just read the following earlier today about a \"Flip Burger\" opening up soon in Bloomingdale's: (from website Eater) Surely enough, Grub Street reported Monday here that Blais' attorneys are looking into the situation. Apparently, Bloomingdales hasn't applied for a trademark and Blais' Flip has. Not only should Flip Bloomingdales be made to change their name, they should also change their absurdly expensive prices and asinine policies ($15 min per person during lunch) while they're at it.

SUSHISAMBA Offers James Beard Menu to Public

Some of NYC's best chefs are hosting multi-course dinners with wine pairings at the James Beard House throughout 2009. Last week it was SUHSISAMBA's turn with its chefs from NYC, Miami and Vegas showing up for the occasion. Later this month, Ryan Skeen of Irving Mill will be hosting a \"Pig and Pinot Feast\" at James Beard ($125 for members, $165 for public, ticket info here). According to the JBF website, Skeen has composed a pig-centric menu of signature dishes to be paired with a bold selection of Pinot Noirs from around the world. Sounds like a pretty good sequel to Cochon 555 for all you pork-ophiles. SUSHISAMBA informed us yesterday that its SUSHISAMBA park location (245 Park Avenue South) will be offering an exclusive prix-fixe menu created by their chefs and inspired by their recent dinner at the James Beard House. The five course menu (see after the jump) will be $80 per person and $110 per person with wine and sake pairings. In addition, SUSHISAMBA will be offering a special promotion for the month of March.

We are headed to Brazil tonight to wine and dine our way through Buzios and Rio de Janeiro. We plan on enjoying lots of caipirinhas (heavy on the cachaca) and we will certainly try out all the local flavors. We'll hit up as many churrascarias, comida a quilos, and beachside kiosks as our stomachs can handle. If you have any insider tips or places we shouldn't miss, please let us know!

You asked for it. You got it. Here's your guide to Boozy Brunches in NYC.

We'll be continuously updating this list as comments come in with new ones. We also list the restaurants doing 2+ complimentary brunch cocktails and the 1-complimentary brunch cocktail spots.

Just an FYI- Nero is now ala carte, no more unlimited... and listen to these prices, $14 for 1 mimosa, bloody mary, etc, or you can get a pitcher for $100! We didn't stay long enough to ask if that pitcher was a 5 gallon bucket, but quite a change from the unlimited deal. -Oh and it was empty at noon on a sunny saturday, 3 people were there discussing how they were eating quick and then going elsewhere, no drinks. -We went around the corner to Paradou and sat in their great garden space, perfect! They were packed but were able to squeeze us in even without a res.

Irving Mill Announces New \"Sunday Supper\"

***CONTENT
Just read on Serious Eats that Irving Mill has announced a Sunday Supper special that includes \"Dale’s Pale Ale Beer-Can Chicken\" as one of the main courses, along with salad, soup, and cupcakes for $60. And we just learned from Zagat Buzz that the Sunday Supper menu is even more extensive than we thought. Click here for the full menu. Add this to Irving Mill's Monday night Burger + Sixpoint Beer for $15 special. Lots of people have been pretty critical of restaurants that are just blindly throwing out special after special with little or no thought. It's good to see places like Irving Mill that are putting time, energy and creativity into coming up with compelling specials. A few others who are doing it right include Craftsteak with its \"Halfsteak\", Beacon with its \"60-Day Stimulus Package\" and Dovetail with its Sunday Suppa. Just heard from Irving Mill that they are also offering 2-for-1 cans of Dale's Pale Ale and Snapperhead IPA on Sunday nights. Sweet!

Full Halfsteak menu is here (scroll to the end). It changes frequently, but this should at least give you an idea. The Harrison: Offering certain bottles of wine at cost on Monday nights (3 for $15, 3 for $20 and 3 for $25) Jean-Georges Restaurants: \"Half-Glass\" Wine Special means you pay half the cost of a normal glass and get a generous half-sized glass of wine Kampuchea: Every Sunday get 50% off any bottle of wine with dinner Kyotofu: 50% off of all sake glasses and bottles on Sundays The Modern: Every bottle of wine in the Bar Room is now $50 or less New York City Restaurant Group Restaurants: Party like it's $19.99 for 2009 Special.

Thanks lesider. We'll add that one to the list. Wonder if they've reduced the price of the $175 Richard Nouveau Burger -- the foie gras, shaved truffle bomb.

The Battle of the Brussels: Who Serves the Best Sprouts in the City?

As anyone who has dined with me on a few occasions must know, I have a slight obsession with great brussels sprouts. Maybe that's because they are so often roasted or caramelized and served with pork, such as bacon, pancetta and pork fat, and/or a hearty, savory cheese... vegetables just don't get any better. I have had quite a few amazing brussels sprout sides in NYC and I will list my favorites below, but have I had the best? I have listed my top five faves and ones that I have been told I must try, but if I am missing any of the city's best leafy green buds (I'm talking mini cabbages here), please do send me in the right direction. My Top 5 Favorites: 1. Momofuku Ssam Bar (207 2nd Ave. at 13th St.): Satur Farm's fried brussels sprouts with mint, scallions, fish sauce vinaigrette. Pictured above courtesy of Marc Shepherd with New York Journal 2. Babbo (110 Waverly Place btw MacDougal and 6th Ave.): Brussels sprouts with pancetta. 3. mia dona (206 E. 58th btw 2nd and 3rd): Roasted brussels sprouts with pecorino and pancetta. 4. Wildwood Barbeque (255 Park Ave. South @ 18th): Brussels sprouts with sweet onions and bacon. 5. The Smith (55 3rd Ave. btw 10th and 11th): Caramelized brussels sprouts (sans pork but crispy and tasty) 5 Other Popular Picks I Have Yet to Try: 1. Alta (64 W. 10th St. btw 5th and 6th Ave.): Crispy brussels sprouts with fuji apples, crème fraiche, and pistachio nuts. 2. Casa Mono (52 Irving Place @ 17th St.): Brussels sprouts a la plancha. 3. Blue Hill (75 Washington Pl. btw. MacDougal and 6th Ave.): Brussels sprouts and pistachios. 4. Park Avenue Winter (100 E. 63rd St. @ Park Ave.): Brussels sprouts and roasted apples. 5. Lupa (170 Thompson St. btw Houston and Bleeker): Brussels sprouts with pecorino.

I was just at Chestnut in Carroll Gardens and they had maple brussel sprouts that were glorious.

FYI...Overcooking releases the sulphur smelling glucosinolate, sinigrin. This is the reason many people profess to dislike Brussels sprouts. That said, there is nothing better than a perfectly cooked sprout. I too prefer roasting as they seem to suck up all that grilling flavor.

Jean-Georges' Glass is Half-Full
***AUTHOR
Andy

***CONTENT
Jean-Georges introduced a 4-course $58 dinner menu a couple of weeks back at his NYC flagship. As he describes on his blog, \"It’s a four course meal of three of my favorite dishes and your choice of a dessert flight.\" As expected, there are time and date restrictions for this $58 prix-fixe -- Monday through Thursday from 5:30-6pm and again from 10-11pm. His explanation for the rather tight and rather diner-unfriendly timeframes, \"Those are my favorite hours in the dining room, when you can see the sun setting over Central Park and when you can feel the night vibe of the city starting to heat up.\" I doubt Steve Cuozzo would buy this. In connection with this new prix-fixe deal, Jean-Georges also announced that all of his restaurants would be offering \"half-glasses\" of wine. I actually find this more intriguing than the unnecessarily time-restrictive $58 prix-fixe deal. The half-glasses are \"half the price of a full glass\" (think \"Halfsteak\") and allow you \"to taste a lot of great wines without breaking the bank.\" I would say this is Jean-Georges' answer to \"Halfsteak\", but he insists these half-glass \"tastes\" have been offered since October. Jean-Georges list of reasons for the half-glass program make a lot of sense. From Jean-Georges blog post: \"I noticed that people getting together at the bar would start with a glass of wine, and then be stuck in the awkward position of wanting to stay a little while longer, but not for another full glass. (Think first dates.) In the dining room, customers wanted to pair different wines with different courses, but didn’t want a full glass with each course. And colleagues who came in for lunch celebrations would want to order champagne, but a full glass is a bit much when you need to return to work. (In these times, it’s more important than ever to celebrate professional achievements.) Perhaps most importantly, I wanted diners who drove to my restaurants to drive home safely. My beverage director, Bernard Sun, constantly changes the wine lists at all of my New York restaurants to feature the best wines of the times. And he chooses the most interesting and delicious ones for our wines by the glass and half glass. In addition to sourcing unique wines from top producers around the world, he also chooses wines appropriate to the seasons and our changing menus. That’s the real reason I like our half glasses—you can taste a lot of great wines without breaking the bank. (It’s a great deal because these half glasses are half the price of a full glass.)

Wined & Dined Launches 'NYC Recession Dining Guide'

Wining & Dining in NYC has never been more within reach. Here is your one-stop guide for NYC's Recession Specials. We have broken down the city's best eating and drinking deals into categories such as specials by neighborhood, cuisine, day of the week, and more. So, without further ado: Specials By Day of the Week: Restaurants are offering great deals on the slower nights of the week like Sunday, Monday and Tuesday. Sunday nights are becoming a popular BYO night with restaurants that typically charge a corkage fee. And then there's Dovetail's \"Sunday Suppa\" that we continue to hear great things about. Winter Restaurant Week Extensions, Menus & Related Deals: Winter Restaurant Week has been extended yet again. This time through March 20th. Its' not officially \"Restaurant Year\" yet, but it's getting pretty darn close to it. In fact, several restaurants aren't waiting around and have already announced that their Restaurant Week menu will be offered all year long. Some include L'Absinthe, Cafe des Artistses, Compass, Le Cirque (wine lounge) and the Jean-Georges restaurants. Wine-Friendly Specials: Wine deals are everywhere these days. Some restaurants are even offering free bottles of wine on certain nights and at certain times (Philip Marie and Paradou). Several restaurants are offering anywhere between 30-50% off bottles of wine. Which kind of makes you wonder how crazy the mark-ups are when the economy isn't hurting. Restaurants can still make a pretty good margin even when giving 50% off their listed price. Some wine deals can be found at Brasserie and Brasserie 8 1/2, Beacon and Oceana, just to name a few. Boozy Brunch Specials: There's nothing better than a great-tasting, booze-filled weekend brunch, and no other city does brunch quite like New York. Here are our favorite places to hit up on Sunday \"Fun-Day\" and some ideas for brunch spots for every occasion. Top-Rated Specials (Coming Soon): It's not just the casual restaurants that are offering unbelievable deals, but some of NYC's top dining destinations are as well. Think Del Posto, Cru, Jean-Georges, Daniel, Le Cirque and many others. Here we'll break them down by value and Zagat ratings. Burger + Beer Specials (Coming Soon): 2009 is the year of the \"Comfort Food\" and it doesn't get any more comfortbale than a burger and a beer. Here will highlight all the restaurants and bars offering Burger + Beer Specials. Happy Hour Specials (Coming Soon): Happy Hour is gaining popularity as more and more people find themselves in a bar between 4-8pm and not in the office (if they still have an office). Happy Hour specials are everywhere and we'll do our best to bring as many of them as possible to your attention. Prix-Fixe Specials (Coming Soon) Recession Specials Disguised as Anniversary Specials (Coming Soon) Stock Market Based Specials (Coming Soon): Restaurants and bars around the city are getting creative with their recession specials. Paradou is offering a free bottle of wine the first Monday of every month until the market hits 12,000 again (this deal may go til 2020) and Sandro's is also offering a unique stock market special. Steakhouse Recession Specials (Coming Soon): With the financial industry in shambles, steakhouses are feeling the pain, too. No more power lunches and closing dinners. Lots of big-time NYC steakhouses are offering great deals.

Food & Drink Event: A Conversation on Culinary Authenticity and the SUSHISAMBA Experience

***CONTENT
SUSHISAMBA is continuing to celebrate the ten month countdown to its 10-Year Anniversary by hosting 'Redefining the Roll,' a one-of-a-kind culinary experience. Wednesday, March 4th from 6 pm to 8:30 pm, SUSHISAMBA 7 (87 Seventh Avenue South, 212.691.7885) invites guests to its rooftop to meet Executive Chefs from all SUSHISAMBA locations (New York, Chicago, Miami and Las Vegas) for a Chef’s Panel hosted by renowned author and food critic, Bob Lape. The special night of food, drink and conversation includes a discussion of culinary authenticity and how it applies to the successful SUSHISAMBA concept. In addition, guests will be served select SUSHISAMBA dishes as well as signature cocktails. Tickets are available at the SUSHISAMBA 7 restaurant for $45. For the past five years, the concept of 'culinary authenticity' has been a topic of intrigue for gastronomes, chefs and scholars alike. In cities where international flavors are on every corner and a delivery call away - how have cultures been able to maintain the 'tradition' of their cuisine? Is Chinese food eaten in Chinatown as authentic as Chinese food eaten in Beijing? Is 'authenticity' specified in the quality of ingredients and the execution of a precise recipe - or by a restaurant’s geographic location and the ethnicity of the chef preparing the cuisine? What does it mean for a dish to be 'Americanized' when America has long been the melting pot of all cultures and cuisines? Today, every 'international' restaurant contends with philosophies on authenticity, the judgment of well-traveled (or not so well-traveled) patrons and culinary stereotypes. As they approach their 10 Year Anniversary, SUSHISAMBA reflects on the evolution of their Japanese, Brazilian and Peruvian concept. Is a fusion restaurant void of authenticity because it blends the tastes and traditions of multiple cultures, essentially creating an entirely new cuisine? Or, is the creative fusion of these cuisines actually more 'authentic' in today's age, given the current and historic merging of the Japanese, Brazilian and Peruvian cultures? SUSHISAMBA hopes to answer these questions and many more at their first ever Chef’s Panel. Bob Lape is an Emmy Award-winning member of Who’s Who in America and has had a powerful impact on the way Americans eat at home and away. He has sampled more than 13,000 restaurants around the world. His publications, programs and pronouncements span the past 39 years. As the pioneering restaurant reviewer for Crain’s New York Business, a post he occupies 24 years later, and as a similar ground-breaker for the New York Law Journal, he brought careful assessments of dining possibilities to the most discriminating audiences. His daily “Dining Diary” feature on the CBS Flagship radio station in New York, aired 21 times a week, is in its 25th year. He is married to the cookbook author, food and travel writer/consultant Joanna Pruess and lives in the Bronx, NY. Both make frequent television appearances, often about their book, Seduced by Bacon, now in its fifth printing. SUSHISAMBA offers inventive fare that unites bold Brazilian flavors, precise Japanese technique and traditional Peruvian culinary traditions on one plate. The growing restaurant group has recently opened its newest outpost in Las Vegas at The Palazzo Hotel and Casino Resort. Please see www.sushisamba.com for more information about this dynamic restaurant group. This post was submitted by SUSHISAMBA.

***CONTENT
In the \"not a shocker\" category, we learned over the weekend that 130+ restaurants have agreed to extend Restaurant Week through March 20th. Why the 20th instead of the entire month, we're not excactly sure. We'll find out and let you know. Some restaurants are extending into new meals and times. For example, you can now order RW Menu for dinner at Bar Boulud. Also, notably absent from the list of extensions are all of the B.R. Guest restaurants, i.e. Dos Caminos, Primehouse, Atlantic Grill, etc. SushiSamba also chose not to extend. We hear though that B.R. Guest and SushiSamba have their own specials coming soon. Like the $12.95 Sun/Mon Pasta + Wine Deal @ Vento. Other restaurants that have opted out of RW are crossed through below. Click on the restaurant name for the RW Menu (if available). Here's the list: 21 Club - Lunch, Dinner. And don’t forget you don’t have to wear a tie anymore and you can get free parking at a nearby garage from 4 p.m. to 1 a.m, a complimentary cocktail if you reserve through the restaurant’s website, and a gift certificate for 20% off from February 1 through May 31. 5 Ninth - Lunch, Dinner, Sunday Dinner. And by the way, looks like a pretty good happy hour special Sun-Wed from 4-8pm when you can get $3 drafts, $5 selected wine, $5 well liquor and FREE PIGS IN THE BLANKET!

***CONTENT
An idea conceived in 2000 by wine writers Dorothy Gaiter and John Brecher of the Wall Street Journal, Open That Bottle Night (OTBN) encourages wine enthusiasts worldwide to open and share a special bottle of wine. Due to its popularity, OTBN became an annual celebration held in homes and restaurants nationwide on the last Saturday of February. According to the website, \"Every year since 2000, on a special Saturday night in February, friends, couples and groups around the world get together to enjoy particular bottles of wine, champagne and spirits. The bottle that you enjoy, traditionally, is one that you have been saving for some special event that, so far, has never quite happened.\" Twitter Taste Live, an online wine tasting forum, is covering the event and you can log on to participate in real-time. Jill and I had our own little \"Open That Bottle Night\" back on V-Day when we popped a 1982 Chateau Lascombes. We'll be at Carmine's tomorrow night for brother-in-law Jonathan's 40th B-day Bash...and yes, we'll be drinking lots of wine. Let us know what you open!

Finding Beer Nirvana @ Back Forty's Sixpoint Mardi Gras Feast
***AUTHOR
Andy
***DATE
2009-02-26 19:08:00
***CONTENT
After polishing off a couple of pints, including a Delirium Tremens and a Duvel Green, at Belgian beer bar BXL Cafe near Times Square (just learned a new location is slated for 51st b/t 2nd and 3rd), we headed down to Back Forty in the E. Village with our beer-loving friend Martin for the Sixpoint Mardi Gras Fat Tuesday Feast. And what a feast it was. Jill and I love Sixpoint Craft Ales and were excited to introduce some of our favorites in their repertoire to Martin. Sixpoint has been celebrating its 5th anniversary throught this month with events all over Brooklyn and Manhattan. We were a bit early for our reservation so we found seats at the bar. The first thing we noticed was that pretty much every tap at Back Forty is a different Sixpoint beer. Since we were there for the dinner the bartender poured us each an amuse bouche of Sixpoint Brownstone from cask -- a nice semi-creamy brown ale with a nut and malt taste. Next, Martin and I moved on to my favorite Sixpoint beer, the Bengali IPA, while Jill ordered a Belgian Rye-PA from the other cask. We didn't know at the time this is the only cask of this beer in the world. Turns out it was one of the best beers I've ever tasted. Completely my style of beer. The aromas alone rocked my world -- strong hops blending nicely with some citrus and malty sweetness on the nose. We got to speak with Jeff Gorlechen by the bar for a few minutes before getting seated. Jeff handles promotion for Sixpoint, and he explained more about this insane Belgian Rye and how there are only between 50-100 pours left in the cask and then it would be gone forever. When he saw that we all had one in front of us, he quickly had the bartender pour him one seeming to doubt whether there was really as much left in the cask as he thought. We were taken back past the bar and kitchen to our table. We were seated with our beerphile friends, Charles, Phil and Kelly, and a couple of their friends. The first course was shrimp hush puppies (see full menu at end), which were delicious. They were not at all shy with the Sixpoint beer bringing us pitcher after pitcher throughout the evening. It was supposed to be a different Sixpoint beer paired with each course, but since they were so generous with the pitchers, I think we just about had a pitcher of all the Sixpoint beers on our table at several points during the meal. Not that we were complaining, though. At one point, Martin got up and went to the bar and came back with a Belgian Rye from the cask for everyone at the table. Over the course of the night, we had the Righteous Ale, more Bengali IPA, Apollo Wheat, and Dubbel Trubbel with dessert. The food was ridiculously good. The housemade sausage for the second course had great seasoning and the shrimp in the third course jambalaya was unreal. Towards the end of the evening we got to chat for a while with Sixpoint brewer Craig Frymark, who we had met back on Super Bowl Sunday at a Sixpoint tasting and growler event at Whole Foods Bowery Beer Room. He shared a ton of info about Sixpoint and his own beer-making experiences, and we're hoping to have a Q&A with Craig on Wined & Dined in the near future. Here's the full menu from the feast: MARDI GRAS BEER FEAST WITH SIXPOINT CRAFT ALES Fat Tuesday Beer and Louisiana Style Dinner Red Maine Shrimp Hush Puppies Coated in Cajun Spices and served with a Creole Honey Butter House Made Boudin served with Creole Mustard Sauce, and Spicy Crawfish Bread Jambalaya with House Made Andouille and Gulf Shrimp Trippple Chocolate Bread Pudding

Recession Taking Massive Toll on MePa
***AUTHOR
Andy
***DATE
2009-02-26 15:32:00
***CONTENT
Though we have no consumer surveys, stats or reports to back this up, it appears that restaurants and bars in the Meatpacking District are suffering even more than others during these tough economic times. And the reason seems fairly obvious enough. MePa is dominated by tourists hailing from outside New York, businessmen on expense accounts, and scenesters. The deep recession means far less tourists, far fewer businessmen (if any) maxing out their expense accounts, and many scenesters now find themselves unemployed and cashless. New Yorkers have for the most part been avoiding MePa for years and have taken refuge in areas like the E. Village, LES and Tribeca. It also appears that people are eating out more in their own neighborhood to avoid taxi fares. Not too many people around the city seem all that interested in now patronizing the big, uber-expensive \"chi-chi\" MePa restaurants that used to only offer them 5:30pm or 10:30pm reservations in favor of the trendy, euro-tourist types. Also everyone seems to be looking for a little comfort these days and those MePa restaurants are the antithesis of \"comfort\" dining. Those places that used to shun people are now pining for them...oh, the ironies of a recession. Here's some circumstantial evidence of MePa's demise: - Level V has closed - Rumor has it that Merkato 55 is soon to be extinct (they have been offering 15% off your entire check through a site called DiningFever -- which has sounded the death knell for several restaurants) - Plunge and Ono are offering pretty much everything on their menus, including cocktails, for $7 b/t 6-8pm on Mon-Fri - Del Posto has more deals than we can keep up with - STK is offering 50% wine by the bottle and glass on Monday nights - Paradou has a full web page of Recession Specials - 5 Ninth is offering a $24 3-course lunch and great happy hour deals (including free pigs in blanket)

\"Recession Review\" by 89th and Broke: Choice Kitchen's $10 Burger + Fries + Beer Deal

***CONTENT
\"Recession Reviews\" is a weekly feature by website 89th and Broke of a great eating and/or drinking deal in NYC. Now I’m not saying it can’t be beat, but Choice Kitchen is definitely offering one of the better burger deals in Manhattan: a burger, fries and beer for $10…oh yeah, and the food is really good too. There's a compilation of other burger and beer specials here. From the rave reviews of bloggers and critics alike, it sounds like Irving Mill’s Monday night burger, beer and fries special for $15 is a phenomenal deal. However, I haven’t tried it yet so I can’t make any solid comparisons. On to the quality of the food… What can I say? I really enjoyed it. I had the burger with goat cheese (my favorite) and caramelized onions (another favorite) - bacon also came with it but I opted out - and my beer of choice was Blue Point. My friend Abi had a more standard burger with lettuce and tomato, and a Magic Hat. The burgers were big, so big that neither of us could finish, and juicy. The fries were pretty thickly cut, although not quite as thick as steak fries, and they were browned and seasoned - delicious. Again, the portion was so large that we couldn’t finish the fries either. A few things to note: a) there are only three burger and three beer options b) there are no turkey or veggie burgers on the menu, which disappointed us. However, we didn’t ask if there were any available as substitutions (just not listed on the menu), so we can’t say for certain if you can get them or not c) double check your bill to make sure that you were charged just $10 for the meal - they don’t have an automatic option/button in the system for this deal yet, so they have to remember to go back and change it. The place itself was cute. Nothing special, but nice nonetheless. And we had a really nice waiter, which always makes for a pleasant dining experience. Abi and I ate late, around 9 pm, so the place was pretty empty, although I’m not sure how busy it is during happy hour and earlier dining hours. What I loved about this deal was the price savings. The burgers and fries alone typically cost $12-13, but you get that PLUS a beer for LESS than the original price of your meal - sounds pretty good to me! If you’re a burger and beer kind of person, and you’re in the Murray Hill/Gramercy area, then you should definitely do yourself a favor and check out Choice Kitchen’s Monday night special. Choice Kitchen is offering some pretty impressive specials throughout the week, and I’m excited to try those out as well. Please let us know if you have! The Basics Name: Choice Kitchen Location: 380 3rd Avenue between 26th and 27th Streets, East side of the street Who to take: Friends, Co-workers, Anyone Price: $ Even a homeless guy could afford this special. Overall: Become a regular. 5 Stars.

Paradou Just May Be NYC's Most Recession-Friendly Restaurant

Well, we just got through telling you all the ways that new burger joint Flip in Bloomies is the most Recession-Unfriendly restaurant we have yet to come across. To balance things out we thought we would highlight what we've found to easily be one of the most Recession-Friendly restaurants in NYC -- Paradou in the MPD (Little W. 12th @ 9th Ave). Paradou is a french bistro that has one of our favorite year-round gardens in the city. In addition to the AYCD Brunch on Saturday's and Sunday's that they have always offered, where $29 gets you unlimited bellinis, mimosas, kir royales, etc and a menu item, Paradou has been offering several creative and outstanding \"Recession Specials\". We love their descriptions of the special offers which show that Paradou really gets it and understands what people are going through these days. Here is a sampling of Paradou's February \"Recession Specials\" in their own words: EVERY SUNDAY NIGHT: THREE COURSES FOR THE PRICE OF ONE!!! Sunday night. End of the weekend. Night before work starts. You want to relax. You don't want to cook but you don't want to spend alot of money either. We feel the same way. That's why we're starting 2009 with this wonderful special. Come for dinner Sunday night, purchase any entree and your choice of any appetizer and any dessert is on the house. And if you've got kids bring them along. They get their own yummy $9 kids menu. That's why we're calling Sunday Night - THREE COURSES FOR THE PRICE OF ONE!!! FREE WINE MONDAYS!!! We did this last month because we're all affected by the events of the financial markets. Until the Dow is back over 12,000 we're going to keep doing it. Join us for dinner on Monday, February 2nd, and receive a free bottle of wine with your reservation. Whether you make your reservation online or over the phone please use promo code Wall Street and we'll take care of the rest.We're calling it that, because that's what you'll be saying after you have our amazing $35, 5-course prix fixe. Just because we're all going through a tough time doesn't mean we have to deny ourselves dining pleasures. I CANT BELIEVE ALL THAT WAS $35!!! (Was Offered From Feb 16-19 – we’ll see if they’ll be bringing something similar back for March) Why have Valentine's Day be just one day, we're celebrating it all week long with our 5 for $35 menu Appetizer: Langue de Veau with Arugula Pissaladiere Fish Course: Bronzini Filet with Steamed Julienne of Winter Vegetable, Roasted Shallots and Red Wine Sauce Game Course: Lamb \"short Ribs\" Pot au Feu, Roasted Cauliflour ^ Caraway Puree Cheese Course: Chef's Cheese Choice with Accompanying Confiture Dessert for 2: Dessert Trio - Warm Flourless Chocolate Cake, Gateau au Miel, \"La Mere Volland\" FlanThe most famous and legendary wine region in the world. And rightly so. Join us as we taste some of the biggest and boldest from Bordeaux. Some will be recent vintages, some will go back to the 1980's. We'll be tasting the 1982 Chateau Prieure-Lichine (Margaux), 1993 Chateau Les Tourelles de Longueville (Pauillac), 1995 Chateau Meyney (St Estephe), and others. All will be accompanied by Chef Kfir's tasty treats. 5 wines, 5 treats. $35. You'll definitely be leaving with a smile. TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 24TH: BIG BORDEAUX TASTING!!!

A Look at Flip in Bloomingdale's: How Recession Un-Friendly Can You Possibly Be?
***AUTHOR

***CONTENT
A Hamburger Today brings us a closer look at Flip, the new burger joint that opened yesterday in Bloomingdale's mid level of the lower level men's store. And I'm glad they did because now I don't have to waste my time or money checking it out for myself. So let me set the stage for you -- we are in one of the deepest recessions in recent history, people are eating out less and looking for great deals when they do eat out, and restaurants at all levels are offering terrific specials to get customers in the door...and then there's Flip in Bloomingdale's. While the Pat LaFrieda mixes are nice and it seems like they have interesting sauces on the side, here's a look at why Flip is the epitome of the Anti-\"Recession Special.\" (1) Customers are greeted by a \"Please Wait to Be Seated\" sign that informs them of a $15 per person minimum at all the tables between 12-3:30pm. C'mon, this is a burger joint we're talking about. It's not in a place like the Ritz or Four Seasons. It's Bloomingdale's where they can't even give their clothes away these days! In a couple of weeks, my guess is they'll be happy if someone orders a bottled water. (2) While restaurants with great burgers all over the city are offering fantastic burger + beer specials (think Irving Mill's Monday Night Burger + Sixpoint Beer for $15 and lots of other B+B specials here), a bacon cheeseburger + a beer at Flip will set you back $22 (not including tax, tip or fries). If you want fries, then it's $27... (3) Which brings us to, a side of fries is $5. (4) Iced Tea and Lemonade are $4. (5) A freakin' milk shake is $7 (or $8 if you want malt). Save your money and calories and get a fro-yo from Forty Carrots upstairs. (6) An extra side sauce is $1.50. To put this into perspective, you can get a Peter Luger Bacon Cheeseburger w/ fries for $16.50. To me, Flip is just the next Obika. Once the hype is gone, nobody's gonna give a you-know-what about this place unless the burgers are just mind-blowingly good. And from early reviews it sounds like they're just above average. Flip is a slap in the face to budget-conscious New Yorkers. Hey Richard Blais - I am begging you to bring the original Flip Burger to NYC! Save us from this mess!

first of all, its bloomies ppl!!!!!!!!!!! this aint the 99 cent store!!!!!!!!!! the burgers are pretty damn good, the service is outstanding, from the hostesses and the bartender to the waitresses. the funniest thing i found was the bartender was the only male in the restaurant at the time and the manager it looked like, which i loved and we had a good laugh about it.

i don't care if it's bergdorf goodman or bendel, those prices are insane for a burger/fries and an insult to people during these economic times. it doesn't make sense -- the same store that is selling clothes at 50-70% off is on the other hand marking up burgers, fries and milkshakes by 800-1000%.

Huge Carnaval Party Tomorrow Night @ SUSHISAMBA

Tomorrow night should in theory be a HUGE party night in the city. On the one hand it's Mardi Gras Fat Tuesday, which means tons of drink specials at bars and restaurants across the city. On the other hand it's the last day of Carnaval in Brazil, which is one of the biggest party scenes in the world. We're actually heading to Brazil (Rio de Janeiro and Buzios) in less than 2 weeks, so we were pretty excited to see that the NYC SUSHISAMBA locations are throwing a massive Carnaval celebration tomorrow night, Feb. 24th. In addition to the special Brazilian menu (see full menu at end), samba dancers, live drummers, and DJ's, the restaurants will also be celebrating the 10 month kick-off to SUSHISAMBA's 10-year anniversary. I'm guessing there will be some big Anniversary Specials in the coming months from SUSHISAMBA. In fact, each month between now and November someone will win a $500 SUSHISAMBA gift certificate and two tickets to SUSHISAMBA’s NYC Anniversary Party in November. The 10 winners will then be eligible for a free trip for two to Brazil. I wouldn't mind going back again. In addition to the entertainment, passed aperitivos, and signature Brazilian cocktails, there will be tons of giveaways tomorrow night. A few winners will receive roundtrip airfare and luxury hotel accommodations in NYC. Here's a little secret for how to win the first $500 gift certificate and anniversary party tix: ask any staff member for the secret password. The tenth person to email sambaservice@sushisamba.com with the secret word will be declared the lucky winner! Carnaval 2009 Specials: \"Bossanova\" Roll $14 farofa crusted tiger shrimp, torched pineapple, avocado & toasted coconut sushi rice \"Salada de Palmito\" $16 Hearts of palm, papaya, king crab, caipirinha vinaigrete & candied cashews \"Peixe Frito\" $26 Cocacabana beach style fried whole fish, lime, chiles & cilantro \"Lietoa Pururuca de Paulista\" $32 crispy suckling pig, torresmo & tangerines with brazilian beans and rice Carnaval Cocktail Recipe $12 1.5 oz Cabana cachaca 2 whole strawberries (each cut in half) Two pinches of cinnamon One pinch of cayenne pepper 1 tbl of honey 1 oz lemon juice Muddle cinnamon, strawberries, cayenne pepper and honey in a glass. Add cachaca and lemon juice, shake and serve on rocks with cinnamon stick garnish with ½ strawberry spear.

With the already-extended Restaurant Week winding down (slated to end February 27th), Wined & Dined is reaching out to NYC restaurants, including the Restaurant Week participants, to see which ones are interested in becoming a part of “Restaurant Year.” We will list all the restaurants that extend for one week, one month, the rest of the year or even until the Dow reaches 10,000 again. They make the call. Several, including Le Cirque, Kobe Club, Cafe des Artistes and L'Absinthe already have. Restaurants can either simply extend their ongoing Restaurant Week menu or come up with a new special menu deal altogether. Wined & Dined is also looking for restaurants to participate in a \"Let's Get Through $20.09 Together!\" special. We will specially feature all restaurants who agree to offer customers the choice of either an entrée + alcoholic beverage for $20.09 OR an appetizer + entrée for $20.09 OR an entrée + dessert for $20.09. We will be your source for all the information on restaurants that will be extending (or have already extended) their specially-priced menus past February 27th. We will post menus and provide the days and times that the special deals will be offered.

It's no longer the \"off-the-menu\" Greek Salad w/ Grilled Chicken at 100% Halal & Healthy (55th & Park), which Midtown Lunch refers to as \"may be the only salad I'll eat\" in Midtown. As of last week, the 100% Halal & Healthy cart has a new look and a new menu (click pic). It still claims to be \"Low Fat & Low Cholesterol\" though the jury's still out on that. Menu items have been \"spell-checked\" and now include the hugely popular Greek Salad w/ Grilled Chicken, a Caesar Salad w/ Grilled Chicken, Grilled Chicken Breast Kabobs, a Hummus Sandwich, a Veggie Wrap, a Kofta Sandwich on Pita, and a Combo w/ Grilled Chicken, Lamb and Kofta over rice. Not on the permanent menu yet, but still being offered indefinitely is Gamal's entry in the Midtown Lunch Sandwich Challenge - the $5 Gino Sandwich. W&D helped Gamal with this sandwich creation that people so far have been raving about (see comments here). The \"Gino\" includes a combination of grilled chicken and kofta, feta cheese (or American), grilled onions, hot peppers and hot/white sauce on a pita. And if you want to change things up a bit, Gamal also owns the food cart on 54th and Park which has a completely different menu. We'll give it a try and let you know what we think.

A Casual Night Out With Friends at Almond

***CONTENT
In Oct. of '08, childhood friends Eric Lemonides and Jason Weiner brought their French-influenced American Bistro fare from Almond in Bridgehampton and Almoncello in Wainscott to the Flatiron District at Almond (12 E. 22nd Street btw B'way and Park Ave). When Almond opened, everyone was talking about the restaurant's cursed location (see here and here). It's in the former Borough Food & Drink, Brasserio Caviar & Banana, and Rocco's on 22nd space- from DiSpirito's \"The Restaurant\". But we've heard great things about the restaurant from our friends Josh and Nicole who were hoping that it would survive the curse and the recession (they live right across the street- talk about a great location). No doubt a tough time to open but with good prices and good food, the initial buzz was positive. So, after a few months under their belt, we finally made it there last night with Josh and Nicole. The place was very busy and the bar was packed- a good sign. We had drinks at the bar- a glass of Sauvignon Blanc (Loire valley) and a Blue Point IPA. We sat in the back of the dining room near the pool table/lounge area. Nicole and I ordered a bottle of Chenin Blanc for under $40, which was excellent while the boys stuck with the beer. Now for the food... We started with the Fruit de Mer \"tasting of all three\" for about $15. This has to be the best value appetizer I have had in a while. The plate had a generous serving of scallop and fennel crudo, a glass filled with marinated octopus, and a curried mussel cocktail. All four of us were able to have a couple of mussels each and get a nice tasting of the crudo and octopus. I was hugely impressed at that price point. We also ordered the duck confit with creamy lentils and banyuls vinegar for $12. This was also very tasty and classically prepared, but it was not the best choice to split between four people because we had to remove the meat from the bone and divide it up. The meat was tender and fell off the bone and the flavors of the lentils and banyuls vinegar came together nicely. It was a bit on the salty side. BEST PART... \"Le Grand Macaroni & Cheese\" with prosciutto and chopped truffles for $18. Can comfort food get any better than this? We all shared the truffle m&c and I couldn't imagine eating the whole dish alone (well, I could dream about it but would have to spend a few days in the gym afterwards). It was rich, decadent, creamy, crispy on top, flavorful, and fabulous... you get the idea. I do love having truffles shaved over any dish, so this is not exactly comparable to the Waverly Inn m&c, because they are chopped, but I do have to say that I enjoyed this more (and for $18 instead of $55). Andy certainly couldn't keep his wandering spoon away from the au gratin dish. For my entrée, I had the monkfish which came in a tomato broth with mussels, clams, and shrimp for $24. It was as hearty as a fish dish could get (besides some of the John Dory entrees I've tried)- perfect comfort food for a chilly night in the city. I felt like I was eating a tasty home cooked meal and I was surprised at how many mussels, clams, and shrimp were in the dish. The vegetables and fresh herbs were plentiful and the tomato broth was steaming. I couldn't even finish all of my shellfish. Andy and Josh had the plat du jour, duck à l'orange for $29. I tasted a bit of Andy's and the duck breast was perfectly medium rare. I love this dish and it did bring me back to a bistro in Paris- job well done. Nicole ordered the sea scallops for $22 and also enjoyed her dish. I did not try them, but they looked perfectly cooked- another success. By the time dessert came around, we were very happily stuffed. All in all, this is not a bargain destination but it is a very good value for the amount and for the quality of food you will have and for the friendly service and bustling atmosphere. It is also impressive to find a wine list with a number of bottles under $40. We'll be back and next time I'll be challenging Andy to a game of pool. I wish we lived across the street.

Richard Blais is Gonna 'Flip'!

The news from TONY, Eater and Midtown Lunch is that a new burger joint is slated to open in Bloomie's in the men's lower level on Feb 23rd. The good news is that it will feature three different Pat LaFrieda beef blends—hearty (short rib), sweet (brisket) and refined (Wagyu)— as well as lamb, turkey or veggie options, among others. I love the La Frieda Black Label Burger at City Burger. The bad news is that they are naming this burger joint Flip. Sound familiar? Well, it should. Richard Blais of Season 4 Top Chef fame opened a burger joint in Atlanta back in December called Flip. This is where it gets interesting, though. Blais has been hinting since last summer that a Manhattan outpost of Flip may be in the works. As Blais, a New York native, told TimeOut NY about Flip in July: \"[New York] is the next market we’re looking to hit.\" Looks like we may have one of those legal name battles on our hands again. As recently as Feb. 12th, Blais wrote on his blog, Trail Blais, that, \"On the cooking front, of course, I’m getting ready for Flip’s expansion...with three cities expected later this year, and up to 9 the following.\" If NYC is one of those markets, we can't have 2 Flip's here. It'll be too confusing. We may have to settle this in a good old fashioned Burger Wars showdown.

Our Amazing Night @ Halfsteak's Top Chef Screening
***AUTHOR

2009-02-19 17:09:00
***CONTENT
It was a total last-minute decision. Do we head downtown in the cold rain to try out Halfsteak at Craftsteak, the latest recession-friendly stroke of genius from the Colicchio empire, and perhaps get to see some Top Chef judges and contestants in the process, or do we just go home, order in some food, pop open a bottle of wine and watch Top Chef from the comfort of our living room? We decided what the heck, let's do it...and never have we made a better call. Turns out we got to mingle and chat with just about the entire cast of this season's Top Chef for close to 3 hours, as well as 'wine and dine' extensively on Halfsteak's amazing menu. Most all of the contestants were in NYC for the taping of the reunion show earlier in the day. Notably absent was Jeff. The highlights had to be hanging out at length with Stefan, who's hilarious, chilling with a slightly bummed-out Fabio, and getting to meet just about every single person involved in the production of Top Chef, including judges Colicchio, Padma and Toby Young. We arrived at Halfsteak at about 6:45pm thinking the place was going to be a madhouse given the publicity of the Top Chef screening on sites like Eater and Grub Street. Much to our surprise, Halfsteak, the name for the massive bar area in the front of the restaurant, was not a mob scene yet. The hostess told us that if we were ordering dinner that we could have one of the open tables and stay through the screening. She said we were going to be \"quite pleased\" with our table in the back left section of the bar area. Turns out we were at the table closest to the long table set up for the Top Chef crew. What ensued was perhaps the most memorable, entertaining and indulgent 5-hours we've ever spent in a restaurant. We were first struck by just how extensive the selections at Halfsteak are. Colicchio and chef Shane McBride did not mess around when brainstorming and creating this massive double-sided menu (see last night's full menu at the end). There are sections of small plates, salads, sandwiches, “small pots” and even a half order of a steak w/ fries, all for under $15, and many for under $10. The menu also includes half pints of beer for $3.50, specialty cocktails for $7.50, an array of wines by the glass for around $10 and several reasonably priced bottles of wine. We knew we needed to devise an ordering strategy. There were so many things we wanted to try and so much time we needed to kill. But first we needed a drink. We each went with the \"Half Naked,\" a libation of tequila, cointreau, jalapeno and fresh lime juice. Served in a mini mason jar, this was a perfect cocktail with a kick. For Round 1, we went with the Fried Oysters, Sliders and a Romaine Salad w/ shredded truffled pecorino cheese. All three were delicious, but the sliders were my favorite. The fried oysters were up there as one of Jill's faves. Jill then ordered a glass of white wine while for some reason I decided to make it my mission to drink all 5 of the half-pints on tap...and so I started with the Smuttynose IPA. Apparently, a team from CNN had heard all the buzz about Halfsteak and the Top Chef screening and they were on-hand to interview people for a story on dining during the recession and the toll it's taking on restaurants. They came over and interviewed Jill and I for the story, and we got in some good plugs for W&D. We'll have to wait and see if we make the cut. The interview killed some time and we decided to embark on Round 2. We went with the Chicken Fried Cod and Sausgage w/ Feta, Romaine and Grapefruit. Both of these were insanely good. Jill's favorite of the night was the Cod with the capers and great tartar sauce. I loved the spiciness of the sausage link, especially in combination with the grapefruit. By now it was 8:30pm and the Top Chef crew would be arriving in the next half hour or so. Jill decided to order a bottle of wine, a 2005 Gigondas, while I proceeded with Beer #2, a Pork Slap. For Round 3, we slowed down a bit and went with the Chicken & Lobster Pot Pie. Unfortunately, it arrived just as all the Top Chef contestants were arriving, so I was a bit distracted as Fabio and Stefan took seats at the long table less than a foot away from us. Jill loved it and said it was her second favorite dish next to the fried cod. It was pretty surreal watching everyone show up one-by-one and take seats literally right next to us. Stefan was in good spirits and started chatting with us. It was pretty obvious he wasn't going home this week. His drink was taking a while to arrive so we poured him some of our wine. We chatted a bit with Fabio, who was so nice and outgoing despite the bad news that was about to become public. I have to say he didn't seem his normal self and even seemed to get a bit frustrated with Stefan, who was bouncing around the room taking pics with fans and seemingly on top of the world. If it wasn't apparent then, we started to figure out during the show that Fabio was the one going home. Also in the house was Ken Friedman, a principal owner of The Spotted Pig, The John Dory and The Rusty Knot. Apparently, the contestants all were at The Spotted Pig for dinner the night before. Padma arrived with Ted Forstmann. Newlywed Gail Simmons was there with husband Jeremy. Despite all the fanfare and mingling, we still had some eating to do. So we ordered the signature halfsteak w/ fries and fried mac & cheese for Round 4. The steak, a generous 6 oz. NY Strip, was cooked perfectly and delicious. It may be that we were caught up in the moment, but we were not blown away by the fried mac & cheese. We'll have to give it another try soon. Unfortunately, the volume wasn't turned up enough for any of us to really hear what was going on in the show. Who needs volume, though, when you have Stefan adding commentary? Unfortunately, Stefan soon left the table due to the lack of volume and went to watch the show at the bar where it could be heard. Towards the end of the show, Padma, Tom and Toby all came to the back of the table near us to mingle with some of the other contestants. One of the highlights had to be getting to hang out back there and overhear all of the interesting conversations and witness the dynamic between everyone. Fabio was talking with Padma just as he was about to get the boot and I overheard him ask her, \"Did you really tell me to pack my knives and go home or did you just say my name?\" We also had a nice conversation with contestant Ariane, who was there with her husband and daughters. In fact, we're going to head out to Montclair, NJ one of these days to check out her restaurant, CulinAriane. After the show, we ordered our last drinks, and got to chat some more with Stefan by the bar. We found out about some pretty cool things he has in the works. We couldn't have possibly had a better night! We'll definitely be back again soon to take advantage of Halfsteak and try out some of the things we missed. Here's the full Halfsteak menu: halfsteak snacks = $6 ½ Fried Oysters w/ Smoked Cole Slaw Smoked Chicken Wings w/ White BBQ Sauce Lamb Spare Ribs w/ Cucumber Raita Sliders w/ Balsamic Onions & Truffled Pecorino Fried Mac & Cheese w/ Tomato Marmalade leafy = $7 ½ Arugula w/ Parmesan & Meyer Lemon Romaine w/ Truffled Pecorino & Creamy Garlic Iceberg Lettuce w/ Calamata Olives, Feta & Piquillo Peppers Baby Greens w/ Roasted Beets & Sherry Vinegar small plates = $9 ½ Chicken Fried Cod w/ Hash Browns & Tartar Sauce Duck Confit Omelet w/ Maitake Mushrooms & Fontina Pig Trotter w/ Frisée, Apple & Ham Merguez Sausage w/ Feta, Romaine & Grapefruit Country Ham w/ Deviled Egg & Pickles Fried Tripe w/ Roasted Tomato & Garlic Vinaigrette Wagyu Nachos sandwiches = $11 ½ “halfsteak” Burger w/ Hand Cut Fries Fried Oyster Po’ Boy w/ Creole Aïoli Brisket, Sauerkraut & Provolone Patty Melt Grilled Cheese w/ Country Ham & Aged Cheddar halfsteak with fries = $14 ½ one-pots = $13 ½ Chicken & Lobster Pot Pie Pork & Beans Bowl of Red w/ Corn Bread Croutons Meatball, Gnocchi & Smoked Mozzarella Casserole dessert = $4 ½ Ice Cream Sandwich of the Day Red Velvet Cupcake halfsteak cocktails = $7 ½ My Better Half: Tito’s Vodka w/ Blood Orange Juice, Campari & Lemon Thyme Not Half Bad: Old Fitzgerald Straight Bourbon w/ Honey-Tea Soda Half Naked: Corazón Blanco, Cointreau, Jalapeño, Fresh Lime Juice Half Sunset: Linie Aquavit, Grapefruit Juice, Cranberry-Cardamom Syrup half pints = $3 ½ Victory, Prima Pils, PA Blue Point, Toasted Lager, NY Pork Slap, Pale Ale, NY Smuttynose, IPA, NH Tröegs, Nut Brown Ale, PA glasses $9 ½ Sauvignon Blanc, Château Lamothe, Bordeaux Trebbiano, La Parrina, Tuscany Malbec, Gouguenheim, Mendoza Tempranillo, Ribera del Duero, El Quintanal glasses $10 ½ Pinot Blanc, Geard Metz, Alsace Verdejo, Blume, Rueda Grenache, Côtes du Rhône Villages, La Florane Merlot, Château Lamothe, Bordeaux sparkling Prosecco di Valdobbiadene, Val d’Oca, NV, Veneto 48.

Making Our Own RW Menu & Recession Special at Mia Dona
***AUTHOR

***DATE
2009-02-19 12:31:00
***CONTENT
We reported earlier that Mia Dona is one of the restaurants that has extended Restaurant Week through February 27th, so we headed over to our favorite Italian neighborhood spot for dinner this past Monday night. Mia Dona, brought to us by restaurateur Donatella Arpaia and chef Michael Psilakis, is our go-to spot for amazing Italian in our neighborhood of midtown east (located at 206 East 58th btw 2nd and 3rd). It has always tended to be more of a splurge night out rather than a budget dinner choice for us, but we figured out that it doesn't have to be (even when the Feb. 27th Restaurant Week extension is over). We remember reading this Bruni NYT article back in December (that our ATL friend Elyssa forwarded to us) about how Bruni spent less than $100 on 3-course dinners for two at 5 great restaurants over a 5-night period (inlcuding tax and tip, but excluding alcohol). What we took away from this article (besides a strong desire to try The Redhead in E. Village) is the idea that high-end restaurants can either be as expensive or as reasonable as a diner makes them. We've found that by carefully steering our way through a menu, especially the small plates and appetizers section, we can come away from a great restaurant plenty full after having tried many of the best offerings... and with some money still in our pocket. Mia Dona is a case-in-point. Andy and I were dining with family, Donna, Stacey, and little Zoe, so we wanted to try a lot of different dishes and not stick to the Restaurant Week selections (although the RW menu did look great- 4 choices of appetizers including the meatballs and the orecchiette, 4 choices of entrees including the butternut squash tortelli and grilled branzino, and 4 choices of desserts including the tiramisu and maple panna cotta gelato). We did take advantage of the RW wine, a nice bottle of Italian red for $35- Rosso di Toscana, caparzo, montalcino, Italy ($8 by the glass). In the end, we realized that if you put your mind to it, you can walk away from Mia Dona without paying a fortune for an excellent dinner. I chose an appetizer for my main course- the grilled octopus with fingerling potatoes, olives, feta, and anchovy vinaigrette for $14. I had ordered this dish before and was really craving it (well that and the gnudi but I was trying not to overindulge after a ridiculous weekend of eating). As somewhat of a 2nd course, I ordered my favorite side- roasted brussels sprouts, pecorino, and pancetta for $10. The brussels sprouts are so good... a very generous portion of sprouts and a ton of pancetta. The savory, smoky goodness would be quite hard to find in any other vegetable dish. So, my food total (minus the bites I took from everyone else's plates) amounted to $24 pre-tax/tip. Not so bad for a satisfying Mia Dona dinner. Andy chose a bit of a pasta tasting dinner. He first started off with the mia meatballs with tomato, onion, and parmesan for $9- hearty, classic, and gone as soon as they arrived. Instead of choosing one large pasta, he went with two small portions. Mia Dona has two sizes (and two prices) for all their pasta dishes, so this is a nice option if you don't want a massive plate of pasta, want some variety and also want to save some cash. He ordered a small plate of the gnudi with mushrooms, crispy prosciutto, and truffle butter (our absolute favorite menu item) for $12. He also ordered a small plate of the pappardelle bolognese with veal, speck, and parmesan for $11. His \"pasta tasting\" with an appetizer came to $32 pre-tax/tip. We both saved some money over the Restaurant Week dinner price while still enjoying our favorite dishes. We also took advantage of the $35 RW wine option (they have a white choice as well). Being that we're not that into dessert, this was surely the way to go. We also have to comment on the great service- thanks to the Mia Dona crew for squeezing us in with a stroller for niece Zoe! And for a last comment on Mia Dona... pitchers of PBR for $9... oh yeah, and they have a daily happy hour special b/t 5:00-7:00pm where you can get 2-for-1 beers and mixed drinks...need we say more?

Sandro's Dow Jones Pasta Index Special

***CONTENT
We have been hearing about more and more stock market-based Recession Specials. The latest one comes from Sandro's, a traditional Roman Italian restaurant on the UES (81st nr 2nd Ave). Starting today, Monday through Friday from 4:30pm to 6:30pm, Sandro’s pastas are priced at the first three digits of the day’s closing of the Dow Jones Index until the Dow breaks 11,000, i.e. circa 2012. While I'm no Alan Greenspan, I can guarantee you this special ain't going away anytime soon. So, if the Dow closes today between 7,500-7,600 the price of any pasta will be between $7.50-$7.60, or about a third of the regular prices of $19-21. Some other stock market based specials, including one involving bottles of wine, follow... The \"Market Tanked? Get Tanked!\" Special at Trinity Place located in the Financial District (Broadway at Cedar): All drinks are $3 from 3:30 p.m. to 5 p.m. whenever the market finishes in the red. Bailout Wine by Crushpad: We heard about this special stock market driven wine deal from the good folks at TastingTable. Here's how it works: the 2007 Bailout Napa Valley Cabernet is a blend of grapes from some of Napa vineyards. Bailout's prepurchase (aka futures) price is $39 (not a bad starting price considering the high price of most Napa cabs). And the price can only get better from here; (1) You preorder the wine for $39 per bottle and Crushpad records the closing value of the Dow Industrial Average on your purchase date, (2) For every 100 points the Dow drops from the purchase date, Crushpad takes $2 off the final price of each bottle (which can go as low as $9 per bottle), and (3) The final price will be settled on August 14, 2009, and you'll be reimbursed for the difference (consider it a \"stimulus check\"). Your wine will then be bottled and shipped. Unfortunately, the market has pretty much bottomed out and will likely not fall further enough to truly make this an incredible deal. The time to have signed up for this deal would have been this past Fall, not now.

Recession-Re-smession. We just read on Crain's that a deal is in the works between Drew Nieporent's Myriad Restaurant Group (Nobu, Tribeca Grill, Corton, Mai House, etc.) and food-sevice provider Aramark for Myriad to take over Left Field Restaurant, a full-service restaurant at Citi Field. If things work out, Myriad would be the next big-name NYC restaurant group to join Danny Meyer's Union Square Hospitality Group in setting up shop at Citi Field. Shake Shack and Blue Smoke have already signed on to open up locations at Citi Field come the start of the baseball season in April. In addition, Meyer's USHG has plans for two new food concepts at Citi Field – a taquería and a Belgian frites stand called \"Pop Fries.\" USHG will also be providing all food and beverage services at Citi Field’s Sterling Club, the premium seating area for 1,600 guests on the Field Level directly behind home plate, including a wine bar. Check out the virtual tour of Citi Field here. So much for Peanuts and Crackerjacks.

\"Recession Reviews\" by 89th and Broke: Halfsteak at Craftsteak

***CONTENT
With all the Recession Specials, Happy Hour Specials and Dining Deals out there these days, and with many restaurants extending their Restaurant Week offerings indefinitely, it would be nearly impossible for Jill and I to cover them all and report back to you. That's why we we're excited to announce the launch of a special section on W&D called \"Recession Reviews\" in partnership with the blog 89th and Broke. 89th and Broke is run by Laura and Caryn, a budget-conscious duo of young professionals residing on the UES and Gramercy whose M.O. is to seek out the best places to grab a drink and dinner at an affordable price around the city and then write about their experiences. Some of their recent reviews caught our eye. Their first \"Recession Review\" couldn't be more timely. We learned yesterday on Grub Street that Tom Colicchio and the current season Top Chef cheftestants are having dinner at Halfsteak tonight and staying to watch the Top Chef episode. The pair headed out last Wednesday for a test-run. Here's their take on the Halfsteak. Posted by Laura and Caryn (Laura’s thoughts in italics): After hitting up Craft’s Thrifty Thursday (the one-time Thursday installment of Frugal Friday), I was thrilled to see that Craftsteak was going to offer something similar. According to a post on Eater, Craftsteak now has “Halfsteak” on Wednesday, where they have half a steak, small plates, half pints of beer, half cocktails and sandwiches all under $15. Laura and I immediately made plans to go to dinner together Wednesday night, and we perused the menu in advance so we knew what our top choices were upon entering. We walked in with the grand hopes of trying maybe four dishes or so, but we didn’t make it past two. We knew we wanted to try the Wagyu Nachos and Meatball, Gnocchi and Smoked Mozzarella Casserole, and after our waiter mentioned those as two of the best on the menu, we knew we were set. We thought we’d order as we go so we didn’t get too full, and it’s a good thing we did that. We really wanted to try the Fried Mac and Cheese (another recommendation from our waiter) and the Coullette Steak with Bacon, Mashed Potatoes and Spinach, but we couldn’t bear the thought of trying to work our way through either dish. We finally gave up and just went straight to dessert - Cinnamon Ice Cream Sandwiches with Oatmeal Raisin Cookies. Wagyu nachos: Sooo good. Maybe it seems like a cop-out to get the nachos and gnocchi dish, but they’re old favorites. The Wagyu beef chili was so tasty, and the avocado crème fraiche and Béchamel sauce were perfect complements. I completely agree with Caryn, the nachos were delicious, even though I’m embarrassed I got them at Craftsteak when there were many other options on the menu. Regardless, I’m a sucker for nachos and these were fantastic - the pefect amount of toppings and no soggy chips. Meatball, gnocchi and smoked mozzarella casserole: There was something a bit off about the sauce - Laura thought there was too much tomato paste. I liked it more than Laura and thought the meatballs were pretty good, and I was surprised with how many came in the dish (maybe 9?). The cheese was standard and good, as were the gnocchi. Not the best gnocchi dish I’ve ever had, but then again I was dining in a steakhouse. What’d I expect? The sauce definitely was too thick and the meatballs were just okay, the bright spot of the dish being the smokey flavor of the mozzarella cheese. It wasn’t bad but as someone who has high standards for Italian food, I could do without this dish next time. The best part of the meal was the ice cream sandwich made with cinnamon ice cream and oatmeal raisin cookies. The cookies were soft, but sturdy enough to keep the sandwich together, and flavored with orange zest and plump, golden raisins. The ice cream really surprised me. Typically I can’t taste the cinnamon in cinnamon ice cream, but the spice really stood out this time and it was delicious. Unfortunately the ice cream sandwich served for dessert can change, so there’s no guarantee you’ll get to enjoy this one. The surprise of the evening? Definitely the free scone with white chocolate and raspberries that every diner received in a nice little plastic bag on their way out. We saved ours for snacks the next day and they were outstanding. I love a to-go treat from a restaurant, especially when it’s unexpected. I was really surprised to leave with a scone, and even more surprised how great it tasted the next afternoon. We also loved our waiter. Unlike a recent report of poor service at L’Absinthe after diners opted to order off the Restaurant Week menu, our waiter couldn’t have been more attentive or friendlier, even answering all of our ridiculous questions about Tom Colicchio (and yes, they played Top Chef in the bar on Wednesday night!), working at Craft and CraftSteak, his favorite restaurants in the city, etc. Our waiter also mentioned that during the Halfsteak special, waiters are encouraged to be a little more informal and more conversational with patrons. Caryn and I may haven taken that a little too far - Elliott, when are you planning on writing your guest post? All in all I was very pleased with my dining experience, but then again, it could have just been my good company. I was pleased with my dining experience as well, even though I wasn’t a big fan of the gnocchi dish. Several people I’ve told about CraftSteak asked if the meal was out of our price range. For $26 (including tip), I left feeling completely stuffed - and drank a half pint of a “classier” beer, as well as enjoyed dessert - so a much better deal than some of the mediocre meals I had during Restaurant Week. According to our waiter, Halfsteak will be offered indefinitely, so if interested in trying the meal, we encourage you to call before you go. If you do decide to go, from our experience it makes the most sense to go with a bigger group. If we had a group of three to four, we would have definitely had the opportunity to try several more dishes without feeling too full. The Basics Name: Craftsteak Location: 85 10th Avenue (Near 15th - we know, it’s a hike) Who to take: Friends, Date Price: One less drink at the bar next week. $$$. Overall: Put it in the rotation on Wednesdays - or try to go at least once. 4 stars.

Impressive that the 2 \"half\"-dishes and dessert was enough for 2 people. I thought the portions would be micro-sized. Gonna have to check it out for sure.

Lesider - We were surprised too how large the portion were - but keep in mind we did get heavy dishes. I'm sure if we went for a lighter dish, we may have been able to squeeze in three plates and dessert.

helpful review. thanks. it all sounds good to me except this idea of the $4 half-pint of beer. i mean c'mon. that's only 8oz. they should just make it a pint for half-price. at least there are good beer choices.

DiningFever Discount Dinner @ Amber: A Success!

***CONTENT
We reported our plans to use the 20% off diningfever.com discount for our pre-movie dinner at the Murray Hill location of Amber, and it turned out to be a great choice. Not only did the coupon work, but more importantly we had an amazing Asian fusion dinner and great drinks at a very reasonable price. Before we went, Andy said he was a bit skeptical of all the positive reviewson MenuPages. Turns out they were probably not shills. We will certainly be back to Amber for our next pre-theatre dinner in \"the Hill.\" Amber is located on 3rd Ave. between 27th and 28th. It is only a short walk from the AMC Loews Kips Bay theatre on 2nd Ave. and 31st. We got there early (there were only 2 other customers in the place), so we grabbed a booth by the bar rather than heading upstairs to the dining room. First of all, the restaurant is modern and nicely decorated- tremendously tall ceilings, exposed brick, comfortable leather chairs, impressive floral arrangements, and flat screens at the main (roomy) bar. Everyone was very friendly and happy to have us there. I started off with a very strong saketini (sake and plum wine with some refreshing cucumbers) while Andy had a frozen green tree margarita (with a $2 substitute for Patron). We had plenty of time before the movie, so we went all out on appetizers and decided to wait to order our main entrees. We had the tuna lover tasting (delicious tasting of four tuna pieces with pairings of delicate sauces- I loved this subtle and fresh dish and definitely could have ordered this as my sushi entree), the Vietnamese shrimp summer roll served with chili hoisin sauce (crisp, classic, and tasty), and the Thai spiced chicken wrap (a nice balance with the basil and pineapple, although I would have preferred it to be even more spicy). I switched over to a nice glass of sauvignon blanc and Andy to a Kirin beer. For our main meal, I had the Amber special sashimi, which was absolutely amazing. It was also massive- Andy and I could have easily shared this after all our appetizers or I could have skipped the apps for the sashimi dish. There were generous portions of two types of salmon, two types of tuna and yellowtail, a huge serving of live orange clams, uni (sea urchin roe in a carved out cucumber tulip), red snapper, and fluke. It was presented beautifully- flowers, clam shell, etc. and all the fish was as fresh as I could have hoped for. It definitely exceeded all my expectations for a neighborhood sushi joint. Andy had the Thai crispy chicken breast served with sweet/chili sauce. There was a very generous portion of crispy chicken strips in a very tasty, very spicy sauce. It was a perfect pick for him, except after all the apps it was impossible to finish. The spice level was perfect too. All in all, we couldn't have hoped for a better pre-movie dinner. As we finished up, the bar became a bit more crowded and a few more tables sat for dinner. I definitely hope this place survives, because it will be my go to sushi spot in the neighborhood. Know Before You Go: If you're using the 20% off coupon, they will add a 20% surcharge to the bill automatically as the tip. We had to ask what it was to make sure we didn't double-tip.

while amber may have good food, those are definitely shills on the menupages site. especially the one from 'oldtimer.' classic shill move. it not only talks up the delivery service and quality but makes the place sound appealing to young, hip 20-somethings. i give it a 95% shill probability. the comment from Special G is definitely a shill, too. i have no doubt.

Valentine's Day '09: A Romantic Evening at Blue Hill at Stone Barns

***CONTENT
Andy and I always are trying to find any excuse to get out and indulge in a tasting menu at one of our favorite restaurants. When we saw Valentine's Day falling on a Saturday, not only did we think it was the perfect excuse for a splurge night out, it also became the perfect weekend for a little trip out of Manhattan to hit up one of our all time favorite restaurants, Blue Hill at Stone Barns. Blue Hill at Stone Barns is truly a magical place. Only a short trip from Manhattan (about 35 minutes by express train from Grand Central), it is located at 630 Bedford Road in Pocantico Hills. You find yourself in the middle of a functional, four season farm, where most of the ingredients you taste originated. Talk about a seasonal, market driven menu! Blue Hill at Stone Barns is on the old Rockefeller estate. The restaurant is in a gorgeously renovated dairy barn and sits in the center of the Stone Barns Center for Food and Agriculture, \"80 rolling acres of gardens, pastures and woods.\" On the Stone Barns Center website, it describes its mission- \"to celebrate, teach and advance community-based food production and enjoyment, from farm to classroom to table.\" Our mission- to devour Dan Barber's truly exceptional creations and to celebrate our passion for food and each other in a place where you truly feel like you're a million miles away from the city. The Blue Hill at Stone Barn's menu is more like a list of seasonal ingredients. The \"multi-course farm feasts\" are \"inspired by the day's harvest.\" We read what was in season... Maine sea scallops, Stone Barn Berkshire pigs, Red Russian kale, Brown African goose, Hudson Valley venison, Jerusalem artichokes... it goes on and on. We have been to the restaurant on a number of occasions but we try to go in different seasons for totally different menus and experiences. You have the option of a 5-course tasting for $95 or a Farmer's Feast for $125. We knew we were in for a treat with the 5-course V-Day tasting menu. We also opted for the wine pairings, and the wines were ideally matched with each course. It would be impossible to properly describe each dish, each flavor, and each small touch that made the evening so memorable, so instead we will highlight our most memorable dishes below. Although we are all in a recession conscious mindset, if you are splurging on a special occasion, we urge you to splurge here and make a weekend or at least an overnight trip out if. We promise you won't be disappointed. Our Favorites: Amuse Bouche: They kicked off the meal with an unreal amuse bouche trio. First there was the fresh oyster with cranberries. Next, was the fried potato chip. They saved the best amuse bouche for last. The server came by with 2 tall shot glasses of hot artichoke soup and what looked like a medicine dropper. He asked that we each make a fist. He put a drop of some sort of blood red sauce on our fist and instructed us to lick the red sauce and then quickly follow it up with the artichoke shooter. It was amazing. Hudson Valley Foie Gras Course: First, we both opted for the Hudson Valley foie gras that was served with a sweet, nutty fig bread. We actually preferred it with the bread that was on the table. We washed it down with a '97 Riesling. Decadent. Poached Lobster Course: For the second course, we both went with the poached lobster served over a perfectly executed assortment of savory winter vegetables from the Blue Hill farm. They paired it with a great Chardonnay. We both agreed that this was the best course. Suckling Pig (Andy) / Loin of Lamb (me): Next, Andy had suckling pig and I went with the loin of lamb. Both were perfectly cooked and delicious. We don't even remember the dessert (we're not huge dessert people) but they were terrific and they even brought us the one dessert we didn't order \"courtesy of the chef.\" They also gave us a mini-goodie bag to take home with us. Where to Stay Near Blue Hill at Stone Barns: We stayed at the Tarrytown House Estate. They had a great V-Day package that included a bottle of champagne in the room and a box of chocolate truffles. We thought it was going to be a bottle of Cava or an inexpensive Prosecco. We were surprised, however, when a bottle of 2005 Wolffer Estate Blanc de Blancs was delivered to our room. This wine sells for $35 on the Wolffer Estate website. We also got a complimentary breakfast buffet the next morning in the beautiful castle overlooking the grounds and the Hudson River. While this hotel is massive (more of a business conference center than a small, charming hotel), we enjoyed the amenities that included an indoor heated pool, jacuzzi and sauna. Before our dinner reservation at Blue Hill, we headed over to Cellar 49 in the lower level of the castle. They were nice enough to let us bring our own bottle of wine, a 1982 Chateau Lascombes, for a small corkage fee and they even provided a decanter. The wine was amazing. We took our wine with us and headed to the nearby game room for some games of pool and shuffleboard. Another place that we would recommend staying is Castle on the Hudson. This historic hotel is perched high atop a bluff overlooking the river valley and is quite an impressive structure that replicates the architecture of medieval Europe with a massive stone facade and towers and turrets. While the whole point is to have dinner at Blue Hill at Stone Barns, the Castle has an award-winning restaurant of its own, Equus, which is supposed to be excellent. We had an amazing (and pricey) brunch there and really love the Castle on the Hudson. If you're going for an all out romantic splurge weekend away, this is your place. How to Get Here: Train: We take the train from Grand Central to Tarrytown and then take a taxi from the train station (they are there waiting). If you're staying overnight, your hotel will call a taxi for you to get there and the restaurant will call a taxi for you to get back to your hotel (check in with them before dessert). Driving: Check out the Blue Hill at Stone Barns website for directions.

Zpizza Chain of California Coming to W. Village

We just read that Zpizza, a California-based casual counter-service eatery whose aim is to offer \"lighter, healthier, delicious and creative pizza,\" is slated to open a location in the W. Village. Zpizza has been called the Baja Fresh or Panera Bread of pizza. It's known for its 100% certified organic tomato sauce, 100% certified organic wheat flour, Wisconsin low-fat mozzarella and its choices of unique natural toppings, including MSG-free pepperoni and additive-free chicken cilantro sausage. Throw in some Cremini and Shitaki mushrooms, roasted eggplant, pili pili and truffle oil, pine nuts, Greek olives, roasted bell peppers or caramelized onions and you can think up some pretty compelling combinations here. Zpizza was started in Laguna Beach back in '86 and has grown to have close to 100 franchise locations across the country. There are more than 50 in CA alone. In addition to pizza, they offer an array of sandwiches, salads and calzones. Interesting they would select W. Village over Midtown as the first NYC location. Maybe it's because of all of the Hollywood celebs who know of Zpizza from their time on the left coast. Will be interesting to see how a CA pizza place fares in NYC where we're pretty particular about and partial to our own NY-style pizza. Wake me up when there's an In-N-Out or Chick-fil-A.

Daytona 500 Viewing Party @ Foley's NY Pub & Restaurant

\"Hi, my name is Jill... and I am a NASCAR fan.\" There. I did it. In NYC, it is not easy to be a NASCAR fan and it is never easy to find a bar that will put on the race. During football season, even when the Chase races are on, I've been laughed at, dismissed, and figuratively spit on when I've asked to turn one of a bar's 20 something flat screens to the race. I have found my solution, well at least for this Sunday- Foley's NY Pub & Restaurant's Daytona 500 Viewing Party. The Daytona 500 kicks off the 2009 NASCAR season (for all you Days of Thunder fans- it is the first and not the last race of the season). Foley's is inviting all NASCAR fans in NYC (are there any of you out there?) to come over and watch the race with some great specials. The party runs from 3 pm- 7 pm (coverage starts on Fox at 2 pm). Jimmie Johnson (who won his 3rd championship in a row last year) bought a round of Harp for the room at the Sprint Cup media luncheon that was held at Foley's in December, so if he wins, it's free Harp on the house. Other specials are listed below. The ESPN Zone is also having a viewing party, but to be a real NASCAR fan you need to be watching in a real bar. I'll be there with my Gordon gear on, so if you're a fan... please join me! GO 24! Foley's 500 Specials: - All pints of draft beer $5 (500 pennies... get it) - Chicken wings (buffalo, bbq, or spicy garlic) $5 - Chicken fingers $5 - If Jimmie Johnson takes home the trophy, a round of Harp on the house. - If Kasey Kahne wins, a free bud aluminum bottle on the house (he drives the Bud Dodge, #9). - If Kurt Busch wins, a free pint of Miller Lite on the house (he drives the Miller Lite Dodge #2). - If Jeff Gordon wins, Jill pounds some celebratory shots (not a special, just a hope). - No word on any specials for Jamie McMurray's performance in the Crown Royal 26 car, but I'm sure Andy will be sipping on some Crown regardless. Also offered: a Jeff Gordon's grilled chicken sandwich w/ lettuce, onions, and roasted peppers for $12, a Jimmie Johnson's NASCAR platter of wings, fingers, skins, and sticks for $14, a Regan Smith's roast beef sandwich with gravy for $11, a Dale Earnhardt Jr. burger w/ bacon, mushrooms, onions, and cheese for $13, and a Carl Edward's big beef burger with an extra ½ pound beef patty for $19. I'll obviously be trying out the grilled chicken sandwich, but the wings special also sounds awfully good. Gentlemen... start your engines.

Zach- I'm glad to see that there are more NYC NASCAR fans out there! I'm not in the fantasy league this year, but hopefully I can find enough fans to pull a crew together before the draft next year.

The best NASCAR bar used to be Buster's Garage in Tribeca but that closed a couple of years ago. Foleys was lots of fun, but unfortunately not too many NASCAR fans showed up at all. If you know of any other NASCAR bars, please do let us know.

We have written about DiningFever.com's great restaurant deals before, but we have never actually taken advantage of any of them ourselves. Tonight we're going to finally give it a try at Amber, an Asian fusion/sushi outpost at 381 3rd Ave. btw 27th and 28th. We've heard great things about Amber's Murray Hill location and we're headed to the Kips Bay movie theater (to get in all those Oscar picks before next Sun.), so we decided to do our pre-theater dinner at Amber. We went onto DiningFever and searched for \"Amber.\" The Murray Hill (or Gramercy Park as they call it) location is offering 20% off for lunch and dinner. We followed the three step instructions to take advantage of the deal (call the restaurant, mention the code, and print the page). The restaurant told us that all we need to do is print out the coupon and show it to our server for 20% off (not available on Saturdays). We'll let you know how it works out and what we thought of Amber (applauded by some as the best neighborhood sushi place in \"the Hill\").

The James Beard Foundation: 2009 Semifinalists Announced & Dinner Events to Check Out
***AUTHOR
Jill
***DATE
2009-02-13 12:15:00
***CONTENT
The James Beard Foundation 2009 Semifinalists were announced and some of our favorites made the list (nominees will be announced on 3/23). Dan Barber is one of the semifinalists for Outstanding Chef, and we're headed to his restaurant, one of our favorites, Blue Hill at Stone Barns tomorrow. We've had some of amazing '08 meals at Babbo, an Outstanding Restaurant semifinalist (I am still dreaming of the truffle tasting menu). We would like to say we've made it in Momofuko Ko, a Best New Restaurant semifinalist, but we haven't been lucky enough quite yet. In perusing the JFB website, I came across a number of amazing dinners coming up at the Beard House (167 West 12th Street). Although they are a little on the pricey side (normally around $165 for non-members and $125 for members), when you check out these menus and the wine pairings, there is no doubt that you'll get your money's worth. We also discovered that we can become Associate Members for $125 a year and receive the discounted member price for all JBF events. We will certainly do that, because there are some amazing dinners on the horizon. We will keep updating our events calendar with some of the more exciting dinners that we find, but here is a sampling of dinners we would love to get to in the coming months... 2/19 Modern French Degustation: Jason Weiner of Almond (NYC and Bridgehampton) will serve \"bold, unpretentious French food\" paired with French wines. Some menu highlights: truffled twice-baked fingerling potatoes, chestnut soup with foie gras crouton, 50-year-aged sherry vinegar and brown butter crème fraiche, and seared diver scallops with guinea hen ravioli, salsify, and house-cured pork jowl. 2/28 Modern Mediterranean: Rodney Murillo of Cambridge's Davio's and Avila, \"uses local ingredients to create a varied, modern menu that highlights the best of Italy, Spain, France, Portugal, and Greece.\" Some menu highlights: sangrita shooters with lobster, creamy corn-coriander soup with foie gras brulee and sauternes gelee, Serrano ham-wrapped halibut with Portuguese-style braised beans, chorizo foam, and salsa verde, and roasted rack of lamb with chamomile risotto cake, morels, olive teardrop, and brussels sprouts leaves. 3/6 Celebrating Colorado's Bounty: 3 chefs and the founder of Steamworks Brewing Co. will prepare this dinner \"where you'll sample award-winning Colorado beers and unique wines, paired with a farm-to-table inspired menu.\" Some menu highlights: Foxfire Farms sweetbreads with chestnut puree and caramelized western slope apples, Colorado grass-fed steak tartar with grilled anchovies and violet mustard on pretzel rolls, River Ranches twenty-four-hour oxtail confit ravioli with red Fresno chile, abbondanza black kale, and parmesan broth, and Colorado striped bass steak with Cure Organic Farm fingerling potatoes, artichokes, smoked paprika, and bread salsa. 3/21 A Night at Rao's: If you can't get into Rao's, at least you can have the next best thing when the NYC Rao's team comes to you (or to the Beard House). Some menu highlights: Risotto with endive, radicchio, and sautéed shrimp, garganelli with brussels sprouts and pancetta, Rao's meatballs, stuffed veal loin with porcini ragout and fried polenta, and pan-seared red snapper with cherry tomatoes, Gaeta olives, caper berries, and oregano. Note that this dinner is more pricey than the others ($650 for non-members, $400 of which is a tax-deductible charitable donation). 3/31 Pig and Pinot Feast: Ryan Skeen (one of the semifinalists for Rising Star Chef of the Year) will prepare \"a pig-centric menu of signature dishes to be paired with a bold selection of Pinot Noirs from around the world.\" Some menu highlights: Eggs and bacon, fried pork belly tea sandwiches, crispy pig's ear salad with tarbais beans, chicory, tomato confit, truffle vinaigrette, and poached quail egg, Irving Mill chacuterie plate, and oatmeal and chocolate chip cookie sandwich with Matt Greco's bacon ice cream. 4/14 Frederick Farmlands Feast: Bryan Voltaggio of Volt \"turns seasonal and local into lusty and soulful\" at this farmland feast. Some menu highlights: Longenecker farm rabbit with Sugarloaf Mountain morels, fava beans, and golden sage, Mary's Delight Farm lamb loin, chop, and shoulder with puffed barley and mint pudding, and wild striped bass with green garlic, stewed mustard, long pepper, and fiddlehead ferns. 4/20 Modern Sushi and Sake Dinner: Tim and Nancy Cushman (of O Ya, on Frank Bruni's list of \"Ten Restaurants that Count\") present this sushi and sake feast. Some menu highlights: Kabayaki eel with Thai basil and Kyoto sansho, assortments of Nigri sushi and of sashimi, seared petite wagyu strip loin with tiny smoked potato, grilled onion, and fresh wasabi, and Kabayaki foie gras with balsamic-chocolate sauce and raisin-cocoa pulp. 4/30 California Food and Wine Dinner: Andrew Kirchner and Christopher Keller will present \"boldly flavored California cuisine accompanied by wine pairings from boutique winemaker Paige 23 Wines.\" Some menu highlights: Black cod and shitake ceviche, chile and garlic softshell crab with green papaya salad, and Moroccan-spiced spring lamb with piquillo pepper harissa and fregola sarda. Check out the JFB calendar for more...

(This Post was submitted by user DOHReader) I have a fascination with checking out recent restaurant inspection reports on the NYC Dept of Health website. Thought you may be interested in some notable ones I've seen lately. Here's a little background on the scoring system first. A base point value is assigned to each violation. A Public Health Hazard is the most severe type of violation and typically has a base point value of 7; other Critical Violations have a base point value of 5; and General Violations have a base point value of 2. A total of 28 or more points in either public health hazards, critical or general violations requires a follow-up inspection by the DOHMH to determine if the violations have been corrected. Dallas Jones BBQ (not Dallas BBQ) on W. Houston inspected on 1/14/09: 95 Points - Sanitary violations include milk or milk product undated, improperly dated or expired, facility not vermin proof, food item spoiled, adulterated, contaminated or cross-contaminated, and evidence of mice or live mice present in facility's food and/or non-food areas. Payard Patisserie on 1/20/09: 53 Points - Sanitary violations include milk or milk product undated, improperly dated or expired, facility not vermin proof, and evidence of mice or live mice present in facility's food and/or non-food areas. Pig & Whistle on 3rd Ave inspected on 12/22/08: 50 Points - Sanitary violations include pesticide use not in accordance with label or applicable laws, prohibited chemical used/stored, open bait station used, facility not vermin proof, and evidence of mice or live mice present in facility's food and/or non-food areas. Rothmann's Steakhouse inspected on 9/11/08: 59 Points - Sanitary violations include facility not vermin proof, food not protected from potential source of contamination during storage, preparation, transportation, display or service and evidence of flying insects or live flying insects present in facility's food and/or non-food areas. Barrow's Pub on Hudson inspected on 1/15/09: 79 Points - Sanitary violations include harmful, noxious gas or vapor detected. CO > 13 ppm, pesticide use not in accordance with label or applicable laws, prohibited chemical used/stored, open bait station used, facility not vermin proof, and evidence of mice or live mice present in facility's food and/or non-food areas. Rock Center Cafe on 12/16/08: 50 Points - One of the more interesting violations I've seen is the \"Food worker does not use proper utensil to eliminate bare hand contact with food that will not receive adequate additional heat treatment.\" Calle Ocho on 11/14/08: 58 Points - Sanitary violations include facility not vermin proof and evidence of flying insects or live flying insects present in facility's food and/or non-food areas. Republic Restaurant on 1/23/09: 58 Points - Sanitary violations include evidence of roaches or live roaches present in facility's food and/or non-food areas and evidence of rats or live rats present in facility's food and/or non-food areas. Sarabeth's on Madison on 1/13/09: 59 Points - Sanitary violations include facility not vermin proof, evidence of flying insects or live flying insects present in facility's food and/or non-food areas, evidence of roaches or live roaches present in facility's food and/or non-food areas, and evidence of mice or live mice present in facility's food and/or non-food areas. Insieme on 11/20/08: 82 Points - Sanitary violations include milk or milk product undated, improperly dated or expired. This post was submitted by DOHReader.

Our New Favorite (and Budget-Friendly) Way to Buy Beer: Fresh Out of the Tap and into Our Growler
***AUTHOR
Jill
***DATE
2009-02-11 17:11:00
***CONTENT
Now, we know Growlers aren't anything new to all you serious beer fans out there, but with saving some cash in mind, we've started to take advantage of the growing list of NYC spots where we can stock up on some great beer by filling up a Growler. Growlers are half gallon (64 oz.) refillable glass jugs that can be used to buy beer fresh out of the tap. You can normally purchase a Growler at any shop that sells beer in them, but the trick is to hold on to your Growler to save when you go back for a refill. Also, Growlers are ideal for bringing home some of your favorite beers that don't otherwise come in bottles/cans (think our local favorite Sixpoint). You're also getting fresh beer at home and going a little green in the process (reuse, recycle...). With Valentine's Day quickly approaching, it's also a great way to entice a beer loving partner to spend a romantic beer filled night in (who can resist when you promise to bring home a fresh and favorite craft beer?). We are working on expanding this list, so please let us know if you have some more places that will give us a fill of some quality suds. Where we go to fill up our Growler: - Whole Foods Bowery Beer Room: Check out the Whole Foods Bowery Beer Room at 95 East Houston and Bowery. Head to their website for their current line up of draught beers and for their Growler prices. - Blind Tiger Ale House: One of our favorite bars sells growlers. Head to the W. Village for your fill and do stay for a bowl of chili by the fire (so good)- 281 Bleeker St. @ Jones. - The Ginger Man: Head over to 11 East 36th btw Madison and 5th Ave. to fill up on your way home for work. Definitely a great selection. - Rattle 'N Hum: While you're in the Ginger Man area, make a stop at Rattle 'n Hum- 14 East 33rd btw Madison and 5th Ave. Two great beer bars only 3 blocks away... how convenient. - New Beer Distributors: You can also find some hard to track down brews at this LES beer center- 167 Chrystie St. btw Rivington & Delancey. - Grab Specialty Foods: If you're in Brooklyn, specifically Park Slope, fill up at Grab Specialty Foods- 7th Ave btw. 14th & 15th. - Pacific Standard: If you're in Park Slope already, might as well head to Pacific Standard at 82 Fourth Avenue btw. St. Marks and Bergen. - Bierkraft: Just in time for Valentine's Day... if you're heading to pick up Bierkraft's 12 piece box of Nunu American Craft Beer Infused Chocolates for your special someone, might as well fill up your growler while you're at it. More my style is their 6 pack of chocolate stouts for $35 (that's my kind of chocolate). 191 5th Ave. in Park Slope, Brooklyn. - Captain Lawrence Brewing Co: If you're up in Westchester, stop at the source, the Captain Lawrence Brewery at 99 Castleton St. in Pleasantville, New York (Fridays 4-7 pm, Saturdays 12-6 pm). - Blue Point Brewing Co: If you're out on the island (Long Island), head to Blue Point Brewery where you can pick up some \"fresh jugs to go.\" 161 River Ave., Patchogue, NY. (Thanks to our friend Riki for the heads up) - Dive Bars and Amsterdam 106: The \"Growler program\" is available at all of their locations for all you UWS'ers: Amsterdam @ 96th, Broadway at 101st, Columbus @ 75th, and Amsterdam @ 106th. - Chelsea Brewing Co: I just gave the folks at Chelsea Brewing Co. a call and they said that they are now selling/filling growlers. After working on your golf skills at the driving range, stop by Chelsea Brewing Co. next door for a fill- at Chelsea Piers, Pier 59, 18th and West Side Highway. - East Village Tavern: If you live in the East Village, head to the East Village Tavern for your fill- 158 Ave. C @ 10th St. Be sure to make it during happy hour on weekdays from 4-7pm and grab any draft beer for $3 (what a deal!). Our friends at beermenus.com have a very handy list of \"Places to get a Growler\" We'll try to reach out to some bars to see if we can start expanding this list. Cheers!

Lelabar in W. Village

***CONTENT
You can add Lelabar to the list of reasons we want to move to the West Village. Andy and I visited this homey, charming wine bar located at Hudson and Leroy this past Sunday...and we didn't want to leave. We were at Lelabar for one of their Sunday afternoon guided sommelier tastings. It was an Austrian wine tasting and Andrew, the general manager and wine director, was our host. We tasted two reds (a Blauer Zweigelt and a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon/Zweigelt/Syrah/Merlot/St. Laurent). I don't think I had ever tasted an Austrian red and it really opened my eyes up to some new regions and varietals that I would like to explore more. For the main attraction, we tried four amazing Austrian whites (a Sylvaner, Gruner Veltliner, Sauvignon Blanc, and Riesling), each unique and perfectly paired with the rich cheeses, Hungarian salami, and dried beef loin. Andy's favorite from the charcuterie and cheese plates had to be the Pecorina Tartuffo cheese- the sheep's milk bursting with aromatic truffle oil and shavings...more on what we loved about Lelabar after the jump...I loved the rich muenster with freshly sliced apples drizzled with honey and paired with the Weingut Knoll Riesling. What a treat! Andrew was the perfect guide, asking our opinions and engaging us in conversation about what we were eating and drinking. After the tasting, we were all chatting and made new friends. It was such a casual, friendly environment for a tasting (not your typical cookie cutter wine bar or environment). After the tasting was over, we didn't want to leave the cozy wine bar. The room is filled with a gorgeous wraparound, oval-shaped bar that makes for a simple, yet elegant setting and invites conversation with neighboring guests. We loved how everyone who walked in the door seemed to be a regular (and Andrew seemed to know ALL of their names). Not only was Andrew a wonderful wine educator, he also makes you feel at home at Lelabar. Our other host for the evening and bartender was Emily. She was equally delightful and so helpful in guiding us to our favorite types of wines when we wanted to stay for a couple more glasses. Behind the central oval wine bar, Andrew and Emily were also preparing some amazing meals. I smelled the luscious white truffle oil being generously drizzled over the gruyere, ementhaler, and fontina pressed sandwich. It looked delicious. The goose liver pate served with fresh crispy bread looked ridiculously good-Emily saw me admiring the plate and gave me a bite to try... not to be missed. Not only is this a perfect spot to take a date or meet up with friends over a quality glass of wine, it is also a place to come and to relax.... to pass the time on a brisk Sunday afternoon and to have a light supper while supping on a spicy, rich glass of Tempranillo. We will certainly be back (a lot). Lelabar 422 Hudson St (between Morton St & Leroy St) New York, NY 10014 (212) 206-0594 www.lelabar.com Happy Hour: Mon-Sat 5-7:30pm $1 Oysters Special: Wed & Sat Guided Wine Tastings Most Sundays @ 4pm: Paired with food from Lelabar's menu; $60/person.

Starbucks To Launch Recession-Friendly Breakfast Value Meals

We had heard that Starbucks was considering making the move towards a breakfast value meal. It looks like it's now official. Come March 3rd, Starbucks around the nation will be offering \"breakfast pairings\" for $3.95 all day long that include your choice of a tall latte or tall coffee + a breakfast item (we hear options will include oatmeal, reduced-fat cinnamon swirl coffee cake, two new types of egg frittatas and a reduced-fat turkey bacon breakfast sandwich). No word yet if there will be a \"venti-size me\" upgrade option. The new breakfast pairings seem to be Starbucks answer to McDonald’s value meals. Not to mention McDonald's has announced plans to roll out an espresso-based coffee platform whose items are priced on average 50 cents or more below Starbucks’ offerings.

Finally, Some Color on the Houston's-Hillstone Situation
***AUTHOR
Andy
***DATE
2009-02-08 10:55:00
***CONTENT
We received the following comment from \"Employee\" over the weekend that helps clear up some of the mystery behind the Houston's to Hillstone Manhattan name change. Interestingly, the commenter does not deny that the name change may have had at least something to do with the NYC calorie posting laws: # Employee on 07 Feb 2009 at 5:02 am OK, so here’s the scoop from an employee. Our owner and founder, George Biel, started his concept with his first Houston’s restaurant in Tennessee over 30 years ago, and has since spread to bustling areas around the country. Houston’s is not his only restaurant. Others include Bandera Grill, Cherry Creek Grill, Rutherford Grill, Cafe R&D, and others. Please visit http://www.hillstone.com to see all our locations and menus. While our family of restaurants operate under the same code of ethics with regards to service and food preparation (utilizing local purveyors, offering great value for freshly in-house made food, choosing small-production wines for sale at far below industry standard mark-ups, etc), the reason for the different names is to reflect our collective family of restaurants. Hillstone is not something coined to mirror another company or brand. Rather, it is the name of George’s vineyard, and at the Lexington and 53rd location, we offer Hillstone wine among our by-the-bottle choices. Changing the name on the menu and what we’re calling ourselves at our two Manhattan locations allows us to introduce some menu options that may not be traditional Houston’s fare but can include some favorites from our other locations. For example, at my location, the Sashimi Tuna Salad we prepare differs from the recipe utilized at other near-by Houston’s, but is the same as is offered on the west coast. We also have a wonderful Corned Beef sandwich, we maintain several in-season vegetables daily and list them on the menu, and we prepare some of our steaks differently from other locations (broiled as opposed to grilled). By calling ourselves Hillstone, we are able to offer great selections from beyond just the Houston’s “catalog” of recipes, and as such, label our location with the same name as that which we ascribe to our collective family of restaurants. I think it’s a great way for guests to wonder “what is Hillstone?” and possibly introduce them to the rest of our restaurant family by bringing them to our website. Additionally, we are frequented by a number of tourists who have come to see NYC. Some don’t have a Houston’s near their home towns, but may be located near a Bandera Grill, or Cafe R&D, etc. Since Hillstone is the name of our family of restaurants, we are saying to them “come on in — you’ll get the same great service and quality of food.” On every paycheck, I and all other employees of Houston’s, Bandera, Rutherford, etc. see Hillstone, and have for several years. And as for the regulation on calorie posting, while our menu items are prepared according to standard recipes, ultimately the final products are graded on taste, and are often modified slightly to compensate for variations in fresh ingredients (”Hey, we need to add a little more lime juice to our Honey Lime Vinaigrette” for example). There is no central Houston’s (or Hillstone) factory where our food is prepared and shipped out, unlike most fast-food chains. We have been hearing about feedback on the web about calling our NYC stores Hillstone, and to be honest, it’s very exciting. We love to hear and know that our guests are so passionate about what we provide. Our business is hospitality, and we value everyone who chooses to dine in one of our restaurants. Ultimately, our goal is to continue providing great food at a great value with efficient service. Why would we want to upset our loyal fans? Hillstone is not a “rebranding.” We are merely highlighting the collective unity of all of George Biel’s restaurants, and continuing his dream.

i live in bethesda maryland. they also changed the name of the houston's here in bethesda to woodmont grill and changes some of the menu items. sadly, this houston's went downhill after the name change (i copy/paste a couple of reviews below from menupages). will be interesting to see if the nyc locations suffer, too.

Chefs Daniel Boulud & Thomas Keller Have Line of Frozen Foods

***CONTENT
Last week Fast Company reported that Chef Eric Ripert is working on a prepared food line to be sold in gourmet markets. Ripert quickly denied the report to the Feedbag: “It’s totally not true,” the Le Benardin chef says. “I mean…there’s not even any flirtation with anything like that. I have no idea what’s going on. Why can’t they call me and find out the fact before they report this? There’s not even…nothing! I haven’t thought about in all these many years. It’s totally not true.” W&D learned over the weekend that while Ripert may not have a line of prepared frozen foods in the works, Chefs Daniel Boulud and Thomas Keller already definitely do. We stumbled upon a website FiveLeaf and here's what we found...\"It's a once in a lifetime collaboration... FiveLeaf has teamed with seven of the world's greatest chefs to bring elite gourmet dining into one of your favorite places... home! Now all you have to do to experience a gourmet dinner prepared by Chefs Daniel Boulud, Mark Miller, Charlie Trotter, Thomas Keller, Antoine Westermann, Reine Sammut or Gerard Bertholon, is boil water. That's right, all you have to do is boil water and voilá you're enjoying international cuisine! Best of all, all FiveLeaf menu selections are delivered right to your front door, frozen and ready form our enjoyment. Boulud's \"menu\" includes Braised Beef Short Ribs with Red Wine Sauce and Salmon Escebeche. Keller's \"menu\" includes Mac & Cheese Lobster with Orzo. Oh, and if you have your own refrigerated truck, FiveLeaf is looking to hire an Exclusive Sales Rep. The listing on Craigslist says, \"We envision every neighborhood grocery store carrying these products in their freezers.\" We'll see about that.

The frozen meals prepared under the fiveleaf name are actually produced by a company called Cuisine Solutions in Alexandria, VA. Cuisine produces all their frozen entrees utilizing the Sous Vide Cooking method. If you picked up Under Pressure, Thomas Keller's new sous vide cookbook, there is a letter of introduction from Bruno Goussault, chief scientist Cuisine Solutions. Keller goes on to sing the praises of Cuisine Solutions and Chef Gerard Bertholon. To check out the parent of Five Leaf go to http://www.cuisinesolutions.com

In honor of struggling ex-bankers everywhere, meatpacking hotspot STK is offering 50% off select bottles of wine and 50% off wines by the glass every Monday. You may no longer be able to expense your steak dinner or woo your dates with Foie Gras French Toast, but at least you can enjoy everything from a $69 bottle of Cakebread Cellars Sauvignon Blanc to wines well over $300 for half the price. Better yet, for those still in denial, you can impress your guests by ordering a $325 bottle of Meritage Cardinale from Sonoma, while knowing your check will only read $162.50.

W&D Sponsors 100% Halal & Healthy Food's 'Gino Sandwich' in The Midtown Lunch Sandwich Challenge
***AUTHOR

***CONTENT
Midtown Lunch, which has been a go-to website for me and thousands of others looking to find \"cheap, fast, interesting and good\" food for under $10 in Midtown, has put forth the following sandwich challenge to all restaurants and food carts in Midtown: \"Come up with a new sandwich. A bold sandwich. A sandwich that pushes the boundaries of what human beings were meant to ingest. And you shall call it the “Midtown Lunch Special”. Add this special sandwich to your menu (temporarily or permanently) and we will post about it on Midtown Lunch. That’s it.\" Only other rule -- charge under $10 for it. It's no secret that my favorite food cart in Midtown is the 100% Halal & Healthy Food, aka Cart with the Greek Salad, at the northwest corner of 55th and Park. Earlier this week, I spoke with Gamal, the man behind 100% Halal & Healthy, about the Midtown Lunch Sandwich Challenge and we brainstormed some ideas for his sandwich entry. We talked about him maybe doing a pita sandwich version of the famous Greek Salad w/ Grilled Chicken. Not creative enough we decided. It then dawned on us that what sets 100% Halal & Healthy apart from the competition, other than the Greek Salad, is its Kofta. For those who don't know, Kofta is basically a type of slider formed out of of minced or ground meat — usually beef or lamb — and mixed with spices and/or onions. Jamaal whipped up a test sandwich for me on a roll with kofta, grilled chicken, grilled onions and peppers, melted cheese, his famous thick hot sauce and some white sauce. There was born the \"Gino Sandwich\", aka the \"Kofta Kombination.\" We then discussed what he should charge for it. I told him part of the challenge is to offer the sandwich at the best price-point possible. Jamaal said he would charge just $5 for this massive combination sandwich, which is a steal. It's available starting TODAY. Go get you some! I had it on a roll, but I recommend going with a pita and feta cheese. I'll grab one for lunch and post some pics. I'm still trying to figure out where he got the name Gino.

Spoke to Gamal yesterday about where he got the name for the \"Gino\" sandwich. Apparently Gino was his childhood nickname so when I told him to think of a name for it, he said that was the first thing that popped into his head.

According to Nation's Restaurant News, there is an oyster boon on the eastern seaboard of the US. This is translating into restaurants getting great quality oysters at very low prices. You can therefore expect to see oysters making their way onto 'Recession Special' happy hour menus and deals. Also look for chefs to do some experimenting with creative preparations using oysters. We've already seen over the past couple of months a huge price drop in lobsters due to a lobster glut caused in part by Icelandic credit lines freezing up. We're keepin' an eye out for great deals on oysters around the city. Here are some we've already come across: Dock's Oyster Bar - $1 Oysters Mon-Fri 3-7pm. And you can also get 50 cent clams, $1.50 sliders, $7 martinis and half-off drinks. (3rd Ave @ 40th) Lelabar - $1 Oysters on Wednesday's and Saturday's at this W. Village wine bar. (Hudson @ Leroy)... Lure Fishbar - This could be the best Seafo0d Happy Hour in town. Mon-Fri 5-7pm. $1 fresh-shucked Oysters. Also $1 Clams. $6 martinis and specialty cocktails, $5 glasses of wine and $4 beers. (Mercer @ Prince). Ed's Lobster Bar - $2 Oyster Tuesday's. (Lafayette nr Spring) Essex - $1 Oysters all night on Monday's and Thursday's and 1/2 price drinks between 6-9pm. (Essex @ Rivington) McCormick & Schmick's - $1 Oysters on Monday nights.

SushiSamba Chicago has \"Sunday Funday\" Brunch w/ 3 Complimentary Cocktails: Why Not NYC?

***CONTENT
I noticed on the SushiSamba website this morning that SushiSamba Chicago is offering a \"Sunday Funday\" Samba Brunch. For $16 a person you get 3 complimentary brunch cocktails (mimosas, bloody's or caipirinhas) and a menu item. But where brunch reigns supreme here in NYC, SushiSamba offers nothing of the sort...not even close. All they offer is what they call a family-style brunch for $15 a person where you choose 4 menu items and you don't even get as much as 1 complimentary drink. Now, don't get me wrong. SushiSamba NYC locations are doing some very recession-friendly specials (like the Bailout Menu offered nightly where you get 3 courses + a cocktail for $35). I just think a Recession Brunch deal would be great, too. So I emailed the following to SushiSamba this morning to see if we can help change this... Hi, My website is Wined & Dined. Just wanted to touch base with you regarding something I noticed on the SushiSamba website. It's the Sunday Funday Brunch at the Chicago Rio location. It's a great deal, and I think this would be an amazing brunch offer to also have at the NYC locations. If it's too costly (difference in Chicago vs NYC rent, overhead, etc), perhaps you do 1 or 2 complimentary brunch cocktails instead of 3. With all of the NYC restaurants doing at least 1 complimentary brunch drink, i.e. B.R Guest restaurants like Dos Caminos for instance, I think it would tremendously help SushiSamba's brunch traffic and would also create a fun Sunday atmosphere at the restaurants. My wife and I would love to go to SushiSamba for Sunday brunches, but it just doesn't make sense and is hard for us to rationalize when so many other good places are offering at least 1 free brunch cocktail. Would love to promote this on Wined & Dined if it is something that SushiSamba NYC restaurants are willing to do. Best regards, Andy Freedman We will let you know what we hear back from SushiSamba.

NYC Is On Chick-fil-A's \"Radar\"

***CONTENT
I'm a native Atlantan and grew up eating Chick-fil-A. Whether a chicken biscuit for breakfast or a chicken filet sandwich combo with waffle fries for lunch, a week rarely went by when I wasn't making at least one pit stop at the location about a mile from my home. For the life of me, I cannot understand why there is still not a Chick-fil-A in NYC (other than that licensee location with the limited menu at NYU's Weinstein Food Court). Clearly New Yorkers would love to have Chick-fil-A's in Manhattan. Click here, here, here and here. As non-students in NYC, we have had to resort to sneaking into NYU's food court or falling back on McDonald's Southern Style Chicken knock-off of the famed Chick-fil-A Chicken Sandwich. So I decided to send an email to Chick-fil-A corporate to see why they don't have NYC locations and if any are planned in the near future. I even volunteered to franchise one. Here's the response I received... From: Chick-fil-A CARES To: Freedman, Andy Dear Mr. Freedman: Thank you for taking the time to contact Chick-fil-A. You are very important to us, and we appreciate knowing that New York residents are interested in Chick-fil-A. Currently, there are no definite plans to develop additional Chick-fil-A Restaurants in New York. The one location you mentioned is a licensee location at New York University (New York University, Weinstein Food Court, 5-11 University Place, New York, NY 10003; 212-995-3057). Chick-fil-A opens approximately 70 new Restaurants each year. We receive literally hundreds of requests from customers regarding possible locations at or near which they would like to see a Chick-fil-A Restaurant. Although we appreciate our customers’ input, our Chick-fil-A Restaurant new opening locations are determined internally through our own market research after thoughtful analysis. Please rest assured, however, that New York is on our radar, and we will forward your request to the appropriate parties within Chick-fil-A. We also appreciate your interest in franchising a Chick-fil-A. Our Franchisee Opportunity program is designed for individuals who desire to personally operate their own business but may lack the large capital outlay. A Chick-fil-A Operator/Franchisee manages the restaurant on a day-to-day basis and may not have any other active business venture other than the restaurant. Again, thank you for your time and interest in Chick-fil-A. Sincerely, Tamara Chick-fil-A CARES We'll keep you posted, but it does not seem there will be NYC Chick-fil-A relief anytime soon. Next up, Waffle House.

I'm also an Atlantan who missed the Chick. Every time I fly down there, I hit the Dwarf House off 85 as I head north into the city. The trick is to create a true value proposition for Chick-fil-A, who, as a business, wants to make sure they are going to get a return on any store they open. I'd think some clever NYU business students could develop a business case that makes sense for the home office, right?

15% Off Tuesdays @ Astor Wines: Local New York Wines
***AUTHOR
Andy
***DATE
2009-02-03 04:17:00
***CONTENT
On Tuesday of each week, Astor Wines marks down all bottles of a selected region of wine by 15%. Up this week are wines from our own backyard. If you haven't tried Rieslings from the Finger Lakes or Cabernet Francs from the North Fork, this is your chance to pick up some good bottles on the cheap. It feels good to drink and learn about local wines, especially during tough economic times. I can promise you local winemakers are feeling the pain, too. If we don't support our local winemakers, then who's going to? I recommend picking up a bottle of the 2007 Dr. Konstantin Frank Dry Riesling at $16, a bottle of the 2005 Lenz Gewurtzraminer at $16, a bottle of the 2005 Wolffer Cabernet Franc for about $19, a bottle of the 2006 Hermann Wiemer Semi-Dry Riesling for $16, a bottle of the nice drinking, light table red 2006 Channing Daughters Rosso Fresco for $15 and a bottle of the 2007 Paumanok Chenin Blanc for $24. And if you're looking for more information on local New York wines, including wine reviews, Q&A's with winemakers and news from the NY wine regions, then head to Lenndevours.

SeamlessWeb is Offering Corporate Users 30% Off Gift Certificates to Over 50 Top Restaurants

I was just about to order in lunch to work on SeamlessWeb, when I noticed that they now have a 'Gift Certificate Program.' I decided to check it out and was immediately struck by the fact that these aren't gift certificates to your local delivery spots and diners, but to some of the city's top dining destinations. Here's how it works: you just enter your mailing address and then you can begin shopping for gift certificates on SeamlessWeb's fairly simple to use interface. The gift certificates come in $100 increments for only $70 each! They say that the gift certificate(s) will be mailed to you the next business day. Some of the restaurants included in this offer are Alto, Artisanal, Aquavit, Boqueria, Cafe des Artistes, davidburke and donatella, La Grenouille, landmarc, Lure Fishbar, Mai House, Picholine, Wd-50 and more. Caveat: Be sure to look at each restaurant's set of restrictions for use of their gift certificates. Most are not valid on V-Day and some restaurants only accept 1 gift certificate per visit.

On your recommendation, two girlfriends and I went to SavorNY for their \"buy 2 glasses, get the rest of the bottle free\" offer! Sadly, the owner failed to mention the offer which is slightly disingenuous but when we told him we knew of it, to be fair to him he actually recommended one of the best wines on the list. After drinking the maximum (of two bottles), we decided to start negotiating - after all there were only two other people in the restaurant!! It is a diners market these days ladies and gentlemen!!!! We said we wanted a third bottle at the same deal. While at first reluctant, the owner finally agreed on the basis we didn't tell anyone!! WHAT KIND OF BUSINESS SENSE DOES THAT MAKE??????!!!!! This is a great 'watering hole' and if the owner opened himself up to people and publicity a little more, this would also be a packed joint during this recession. Lets give credit where credit is due though - the food and the wine were great and at least this restaurant is open to negotiation unlike some others (no names for now)!!!!!

Boozy Brunch: Il Bastardo
***AUTHOR
Jill
***DATE
2009-01-30 18:10:00
***CONTENT
After recently hitting up the very budget friendly boozy brunch at Roberto Passon, we decided to hit up another New York City Restaurant Group all-you-can-drink brunch spot this past weekend. We were headed to the west side for the Cochon 555 event, so we decided to first check out Il Bastardo in Chelsea (191 7th Ave btw 21st & 22nd). Did Lauren and Whitney's visit on the Hills and all the recent attention to this neighborhood staple change the brunch scene, or more importantly the brunch prices? First of all, we noted that it was a lot more crowded than normal. Our friend Leena had introduced this AYCD brunch to us a couple of years ago and it used to be only really packed on those beautiful sunny days when you can take full advantage of their al fresco dining. We were happy to see it doing so well, even if the place was packed with Lauren Conrad wannabees. Secondly, the add-on all-you-can-drink option is now $15 (I vaguely remember it being less) and all of the menu items seem to be a couple dollars more. This is certainly more than Roberto Passon's $8 AYCD and brunch entrees under $12, but it still could be a deal (depending on how many mammouth size glasses of bubbly, mimosas, screwdrivers, or bloody marys you can put back). I had the Chicken Caesar salad for $10 and Andy had the Omelette with Virginia ham, sauteed mixed mushrooms, and he added on mozzarella for $9. We both had the AYCD special at $15 a person and we tried a side of broccoli rabe at $7. Jill's Caesar Salad I love their Caesar salad- there is a ton of the chicken paillard and it is pounded perfectly paper thin and topped with freshly ground black pepper. The parmesan slices are also fresh, thin, and plentiful. The dresssing is not overly creamy and has nice acidic balance. Andy's omelette was awesome! Strangely, it came out looking more like a frittata than an omelette, but the flavors did not disappoint. He never eats the potatoes (watching out for those pesky carbs) but he finished them all this time- either he was very hungry or they were VERY good. Andy's Omelette Frittata Lastly, our broccoli rabe was lovely- great garlic potency without being too oily. I don't think the serving size was necessarily worth $7 for a brunch side, though. All in all, we were very happy with the food but we were even more happy with the service. Everytime I put a dent in my giant (and I mean giant- no flutes here) glass of champagne, our waiter came by, bottle in hand, and topped me off. You can't go wrong on a relaxing Sunday afternoon at a place with the background music of corks popping ever few minutes. Now, for our next AYCD brunch... any ideas?

Wildwood Adds Free Drink to Brunch Menu: The \"BBQ Blues Brunch\"
***AUTHOR
Jill
***DATE
2009-01-30 14:33:00
***CONTENT
Beginning Sunday, February 8th, Wildwood starts a \"Sunday BBQ Blues Brunch\" with Rock and Roll and Blues bands from 12-4 pm (225 Park Ave. South @ 18th). W&D had posted about most of the B.R. Guest restaurants adding a complimentary drink to their brunch menus (we're talking bloody marys, not teas or coffees), but Wildwood was one of two that hadn't. When we were there for brunch a couple of weeks ago, we chatted with the very nice and beer-savvy manager and asked about the lack of complimentary brunch drink. We were very excited to see today that the policy has changed and that they are now offering \"a complimentary 'Cold Ass Beer,' Champagne Punch, or House Bloody Mary\" with the purchase of a brunch entree (that means no free drink with the classic BBQ lunch menu). 'Ask and you shall receive' is what we're learning here. I'm sure looking forward to the Southside Benedict (with buttermilk biscuits and chipotle hollandaise and cheddar grits) and a \"Cold Ass Beer\" for $11, although it will be tough to resist the Applewood Smoked Chicken with a side of crispy brussel sprouts, onions & bacon from the normal menu. Can't have it all...

Your One-Stop Shop for Restaurant YEAR: The List of RW Extensions Grows
***AUTHOR

***CONTENT
The trend is spreading like wildfire. With NYC Restaurant Week winding down and the economic outlook remaining bleak at best, restaurants are extending their Restaurant Week menus left and right. While Restaurant Week organizer NYC & Co. has sent out a note to see if participating restaurants would be willing to extend through February, nothing has been made official yet. IT'S OFFICIAL! Some restaurants couldn't didn't even wait and pre-extended their RW menus. Our readers have been asking us to compile a comprehensive list of restaurants that have extended Restaurant Week to Restaurant Year, or to sometime in between. So, here's your complete, up-to-the-minute guide to NYC Restaurant Year. We expect there will be many more, but these are the ones we know about now: 21 Club - Extended through February 27th. And don't forget you don't have to wear a tie anymore and you can get free parking at a nearby garage from 4 p.m. to 1 a.m, a complimentary cocktail if you reserve through the restaurant's website, and a gift certificate for 20% off from February 1 through May 31. 5 Ninth - Extended through February 27th. And by the way, looks like a pretty good happy hour special Sun-Wed from 4-8pm when you can get $3 drafts, $5 selected wine, $5 well liquor and FREE PIGS IN THE BLANKET! L'Absinthe - Extends Restaurant Week permanently! According to Jaunted, its three-course prix fixe dinner menu (available Monday-Friday) is $30.09. And it's not one of those extremely limited RW menus, either. There are four-to-five choices in each course, and with offerings like salmon tartare, pike quenelles in lobster broth, and fresh profiterolles with vanilla ice cream, you really are getting a meal that would normally run $50 or more. Aquavit - Extending in both the Cafe and Dining Room through February 27th. Apiary - Extending through Labor Day. The Restaurant Week prix-fixe menu will be available Sun-Thurs with no time restrictions AND Monday nights are BYO with no-corkage fee. Helluva deal here. For more Restaurant Week extensions... Abboccato - Extended through February 27th. Artisanal - Extended through end of 2009. And Artisanal has agreed to offer a Cheese Plate (their bread and butter) as a dessert option. Asia de Cuba - Per comment from the general manager below, we learned that Asia de Cuba is extending Restaurant Week through the end of March (lunch Mon-Fri and dinner Sun-Fri). Atlantic Grill - Extended through February 27th. And now includes Saturday's, too, but not V-Day. Barbetta - Extended through February 27th. Barbounia - Extended through February 27th. Bice - Extended through February 27th. Black Duck - Extended through February 27th. Bar Boulud - Extended through February 27th (Mon-Fri lunch only). Beacon - Extended through February 27th. Oh, and don't forget about Beacon's Sunday Brunch with $11 bottomless Bloody Mary's or the Sunday Supper (3 courses for $44) with 30 wines under $30 or BYO (no corkage fee). Benoit - Extended through February 27th. Blue Fin - Extended through February 27th. And now includes Saturday's, too, but not V-Day. Blue Water Grill - Extended through February 27th. And now includes Saturday's, too, but not V-Day. Cafe Boulud - Extended for lunch through February 27th. Cafe des Artistes - Extending through end of 2009.

Also extended the $39 3lb lobster special through February 15th. Dos Caminos (all locations) - Extended through February 27th. And now includes Saturday's, too, but not V-Day. Dovetail - Extended through February 27th (lunch only Wed-Fri). People have been raving about Dovetails' RW lunch. And don't forget about the $38 Sunday Suppa.

Vento does not offer the Sunday Night Special during Restaurant Week. I went last week and I was very disappointed.

Hi Dena- I just spoke with a manager at Vento. They re-confirmed that they are extending Restaurant Week through the end of February. They said that they do not offer other specials in combination with Restaurant Week, which is confusing since they have been publicizing the Sunday night deal. I asked what they plan to do with the Sunday Night Special now that they have extended Restaurant Week through February. They said that it's being tabled until March 1st. Sorry that you didn't tknow this before heading there, but thanks for the comment. Now lots of others can know before they go and not be similarly disappointed.

Thanks John! Was just about to reach out to Tribeca Grill and owners Myriad Restaurant Group (also Nobu, Centrico, Mai House). Heard all of these restaurants are doing great RW meals, which makes sense since Myriad Restaurant Group partner Tracy Nieporent is also the Chairman of the NYC & Company Restaurant Committee, the parent and sponsor of the event. They have to be doing great Restaurant Week stuff at their restaurants and the reviews have been reflecting that.

I've heard only negative reviews on dovetail, but naougatine, bar boulud, aquavit, le cirque are all recommended. Primehouse is an decent steakhouse, but not great by NY standards. But if steak is what you're looking for, its the best on this list.

@ Whitman - Thanks for the heads-up on Rayuela extending RW through Feb. I stand corrected. When I spoke with a manager last week on the phone, the response I got was that they would not be extending RW. Glad they had a change of heart.

Sadly, we just heard from Eleven Madison Park that it does not plan to extend its famed Restaurant week lunch. It is still, however, the Hero of Restaurant Week in our mind. Consider the following: (i) its one of the few restaurants to include an amuse bouche with its RW menu, (ii) each Restaurant Week patron received a $28 gift card and (iii) we just read on this Serious Eats post that EMP offered the Restaurant Week menu for dinner to two diners who did not realize that it was lunch only! Amazing. Who does that? Danny Meyer is a true mensch and other restaurants around the city should take a cue from his Union Square Hospitality Group, which always puts its customers first. Bravo!

Here is what's making the news on this snowy Wednesday morning in NYC: As W&D predicted back in December, beer is becoming the new wine for 2009 as customers seek out 'comfort' during the recession, with high-end restaurants such as Daniel, Blue Hill, Aquavit, Rock Center Cafe and Hearth all recently hosting beer-pairing dinners. Not to mention Brooklyn Brewery is brewing a Blue Apron Ale exclusively for Per Se. Daniel Boulud's new Bowery beer brasserie slated to open this spring is tentatively being named DBGB Kitchen & Bar and beer will be served not in pitchers, but in liter and magnum size carafes. And like us, Daniel drinks Dogfish Head. [NYP] Breaking News from Across the Pond: Street Meat is Unhealthy with a \"Shocking\" Load of Fat and Salt. [Reuters] John Doherty, executive chef at The Waldorf-Astoria, said Tuesday he has left the landmark hotel after 20 years to form a restaurant development company. [Nation's Restaurant News] Zak Pelaccio's Mexican spot Cabrito, which could have also been named the 'Fatty Goat', receives the 1-spot from Bruni. As you would expect, Cabrito does not suffer from a lack of flavor, but there are some \"misses\" there according to Bruni. He does rave about the Rajas con crema, tongue and tomatillo, chorizo and huitlacoche huaraches, shrimp and tamarind ceviche, carnitas and short ribs in red chili. But not blown away by the guac or braised spare ribs. [NYT] Despite what we've been hearing about Gordon Ramsay's crumbling restaurant empire, the $1900/dinner chef's table at Gordon Ramsay at The London NYC is booked solid weekly according to Executive Chef Josh Emmit. [Nation's Restaurant News] Next on the agenda for the commissioner of New York City’s Department of Health: Salt. [NYT]

When Bad Names Happen to Great Deals

This could be the worst name yet ever for the name of a special dinner. We got an email earlier from Zagat informing us about the Wine-lentines's Seduction Dinner @ Brasserie Cognac. Yeah, you read that correctly. Wine-lentine's. What we have here is an amazing deal with a horrendous name. The deal is $49 per person for a 5-course meal with wine pairings (tax and tip not included). Apparently, each course and its wine highlight a romantic moment – from the early bubbles of new love to the seal of a goodnight kiss – in dishes like foie gras terrine with a rose and raspberry macaroon. To reserve your space at this terribly-named dinner, call 212-757-3600 and mention \"Zagat Presents.\" We are trying to find out who exactly came up with the name and who signed off on it. You have to wonder if they even tried saying it a few times first. Did they select this name among other options? Could anything be worse? Let's see if we can help them come up with something better. Leave a comment with your suggested name for this deal and we'll see if the good folks over at Zagat will do themselves, Brasserie Cognac and everyone else a favor and switch the name to their favorite of the suggestions. Our suggestion: The \"Anything Other Than Wine-lentine's Seduction Dinner\" Dinner. Or what about the \"Wined & Dined Seduction Dinner\"?

The Blazer Burger: Worth the Trip?
***AUTHOR

***CONTENT
I have very fond memories of family dinners at the Blazer Pub up in Westchester County. The Blazer Pub, known by many to have the best burger in Westchester, is located on Route 22 in Purdys, New York. It is a family-owned, classic roadhouse that has been around for longer than I have been around. We took a trip up to the Blazer for a visit with my mom and sisters and so that I could introduce Andy to one of my favorite childhood spots. Was it really as good as I had remembered? Continue reading for the verdict... Yes! It was as wonderful as I remembered. The large U-shaped packed bar with Captain Lawrence on tap, the red oilcloths covering the tables, the old school video games, the most friendly service imaginable, and most importantly the juicy, thick, round burgers. Maybe I am biased, because I have grown up with these serious patties, but nothing beats biting into a Blazer Celsus Burger with melted Swiss and bacon as the bun disintegrates in your fingers from all the juices dripping from your bite marks. AND the massive homemade steak fries. I am not even sure where they find potatoes so large to make them. It was such a treat! We started by the bar, because even on a Saturday afternoon the Blazer was busy as ever. Once we were seated we ordered the Blazer Onion- their version of a blooming onion- greasy and satisfying. I had the soup of the day- a classic New England clam chowder- good, but nothing exceptional. My sister, Ann, ordered the homemade chili (always better when topped with chopped red onions, cheese, and sour cream). Now for the main attraction. My burger was excellent. It was just as thick as I had remembered. The Swiss cheese covered my round patty and two thick strips of bacon balanced on top. After adding my ketchup, tomato, and onions, it was nearly impossible to fit the tower of a burger into my mouth. My medium-rare burger was more medium than rare, but it was delicious and juicy. The bun was just as I had remembered, classic and disintegrating into the burger. A couple of burgers at our table were overdone (Andy's medium rare looked medium well), but the server was sweet and accommodating and had another one made with a smile. We had a large order of the huge Blazer fries for the table (a must!). They are so giant that at times, you feel like you're eating a baked potato instead of a fry, but they are crispy on the outside and I just love them. It was all in all a perfect and very filling trip down memory lane. Yep, it was worth the trip. More pics below. Tip- Cash Only.

Going Hog Wild at Cochon 555

***CONTENT
After an all-you-can-drink brunch at Il Bastardo, we headed over yesterday afternoon to the Hiro Ballroom at the Maritime Hotel for the Cochon 555 event. Cochon 555 is a culinary event featuring 5 chefs, 5 heritage pigs and 5 winemakers with the chefs squaring off in a friendly competition for a good cause. It started with a pre-party in the upstairs lounge where guests enjoyed an array of delicious cheeses courtesy of Saxelby Cheesemongers, a variety of creative cocktails using Canton ginger liquer, salads made with Greg's Hemp Oil Vinaigrette and Ranch dressings, an assortment of wines (including Kosta Browne pinot noir and Slaughterhouse Cabernet Sauvignon), and a cask of Dogfish Head 60-minute IPA. A little before 4pm, the judges were led to their chambers to taste and vote. The event, which benefits City Harvest, is the brainchild of Brady Lowe. It all started in Atlanta where Brady is from and has grown to become an 11-city event. All-in-all this was a flawlessly planned event thanks in large part to the work of Brady's right-hand-woman, Carolina Uribe. The 5 chefs for the NYC stop included Mark Ladner (Del Posto), Juan Jose Cuevas (eighty one), Bobby Hellen (Resto), farmer Michael Clampffer (Mosefund Farm) and Corwin Kave (Fatty Crab). The 5 wineries included local Channing Daughters , with winemaker Christopher Tracy on-hand, and Pax Wine Cellars. Needless to say, we definitely got more than our money's worth. For some reason everyone at the event thought I was the owner of Pork Slap beer because I was wearing a Pork Slap t-shirt. In fact, several people came up to me and asked if we brew our beer with pork juice. Each chef was given a different breed of heritage pig to work with (approx 70 lbs). Team eighty one did some delicious pork meatballs with cuttlefish, trotter-sweetbread-and-lobster cake with tarragon sauce, a series of terrines and a slice of porchetta. One team did a delicious pork broth soup. In the end, it was Team Fatty Crab taking the grand prize with their amazing smoked pork that was adorned with a spicy cilantro. Fatty Crab chef and owner Zakary Pelaccio was on-hand and one has to think that his bbq joint, which is slated to open in Brooklyn later this year, is going to also be a winner.

There are so many food, wine and beer events this time of year it's getting pretty hard to select which ones to attend. Here's what we have on tap for this weekend, as well as a couple of events and tastings we can't unfortunately get to: Friday Night - Dinner with friends at The John Dory (unfortuantely no 'Recession Specials' here) Saturday Afternoon - Heading to The Blazer Pub in Purdys, NY to try what we've heard is the best burger in Westchester Other Saturday Afternoon Events -- If we weren't going to The Blazer we'd be heading to the 5th Annual Cask Ale Festival at the Blue Point Brewery (sold out) OR over to Park Slope to taste some Sixpoint beer at GRAB Specialty Foods (4-6pm) OR to wine store Acker Merrall & Condit for a free Opus One tasting (2-5pm) Sunday -- Heading to the Cochon 555 event (5 Chefs, 5 Pigs (not including me) & 5 Winemakers) at the Hiro Ballroom in the Maritime Hotel where a group of top New York City chefs will be preparing a heritage breed hog from head to toe and guests and professional judges will taste and determine a winner based on creativity, classic preparation and overall best flavor. The winner will be crowned the “Prince of Porc”. In addition, five family-owned wineries will showcase their wines plus we hear that they will be serving some Dogfish Head beer. You can still get your tickets here for $125. Other Sunday Afternoon Events -- If we weren't going to Cochon 555, we would definitely be heading out to Blue Hill @ Stone Barns for the 4th Annual Sausage & Beer Dinner featuring fresh and cured sausages and meats, all paired with a selection of locally brewed beers. The cost is $190 exclusive of tax and gratuity. Communal seating for everyone. Blue Hill's NYC location is holding a similar dinner on Monday night for $150 a head.

The year 1964 created a lasting impact upon America: the Ford Mustang was introduced, Beatlemania reached the States and the first Benihana restaurant introduced the nation to Japanese cuisine. To commemorate 45 years as the world's Japanese restaurant leader, Benihana treats guests to a $45 Dinner for Two Anniversary Special beginning January 5 and continuing throughout 2009. Customers will receive the Chicken, Shrimp and Beef Julienne combination entrée for two, each served with Japanese onion soup, Benihana salad, shrimp appetizer, hibachi vegetables, steamed rice, Japanese green tea and ice cream, all for just $45 plus tax. The website says the special is only available at participating locations. We'll let you know if it's on at the Benihana on 56th b/t 5th and 6th. If they say it's not, as you're probably starting to realize by now, we'll try to change that for you.

Guest's Wildwood Barbeque has responded to our call-to-action with a \"Substitution Special.\" Customers will have the option to choose a mug of Wildwood's \"Cold Ass Beer\" or a glass of featured wine in place of an appetizer or dessert course at both lunch and dinner. Have a look at Wildwood's Restaurant Week menus here for lunch and here for dinner. This deal just got pretty good. For $35, we'd definitely head to Wildwood for a choice of soup or salad, choice of skirt steak, smoked cornish hen or apple stuffed pork loin + a mug of beer or glass of wine. Sorry dessert, we're just not feelin' ya. Oh yeah, almost forgot to mention that other B.R. Guest restaurants around town (Atlantic Grill, Blue Fin, Blue Water Grill, Isabella's, Ocean Grill and Vento) are offering select bottles of wine for $20.09 at lunch and $35 at dinner.

We've told you about the burger + beer deals at The Smith and Clinton St. Baking Co. Now, others are getting into the act. Here's your guide to all the Burger + Beer deals around the city: Bar Stuzzichini (Broadway nr 22nd): Burger + a Peroni for $15 at the bar and bar tables (lunch and dinner). It's a great deal because a burger is usually $12 and a Peroni is usually $8. Choice Kitchen & Cocktails (3rd b/t 27th and 28th St.): Burger, fries and a beer for only $9 on Monday nights. Clinton St. Baking Co. & Restaurant (Clinton b/t Houston and Stanton): Burger + Beer for $12 (6-8pm Mon-Sat). It's a great deal because a burger is usually $14 and a beer is $7. Community Food & Juice (Broadway b/t 112th and 113th): Burger + Beer for $15 (6-7pm Mon-Thurs). It's a great deal because a burger is usually $14 and a beer is $6.75 -- not too mention they have Sixpoint Sweet Action. Several more Burger + Beer specials after the jump... Irving Mill (16th nr Irving Pl): Burger + Sixpoint Beer for $15 every Monday. It's a great deal because the mixture of 70% 50/50 Niman Ranch flap steak that is aged for 5 weeks and whole beef cheek with 30% pork fatback burger that has left the likes of Bruni and Ed Levine swooning is usually $15 on its own and because we love Sixpoint Beers (which would usually be $8). The beer is the Sixpoint Brownstone. In fact, this Monday the 26th we hear a Sixpoint rep will be on-hand. We'll be there, too. I have to say I was not as enamored as others with the Skeen Burger my first go around and am looking forward to getting back in there and trying it again. Jerry's Cafe (Chambers b/t Church and Broadway): 8oz. Burger + Beer or Glass of Wine for $8. It's a great deal because the Jerry's 8oz. Burger is usually $13 on its own and Beers are $5. Not sure how long this deal is lasting. We'll find out and get back to ya. Paris Commune (Bank St. nr Greenwich St. in W. Village): Complimentary beer with your burger everyday before 7pm Prune (1st nr First): $15 Burger + Beer Bloody Mary Deal. Mon - Fri, 5:30 - 7:30. The Smith (3rd b/t 10th and 11th): Burger + Beer on Sunday's after 5pm for $12 $14. I think they upped the price by a couple of bucks recently, but still a pretty darn good deal. Great beer selection that includes Sixpoint Bengali Tiger IPA and Peak Organic Espresso Amber Ale. It's a great deal because a burger is usually $14 on its own and a Beer is usually $6. Stand (12th b/t Univ Pl and 5th): 2 for 1 Burgers everyday b/t 3-5pm or get a free Beer with your Burger everyday b/t 5-7pm. Stand has great beers on tap. Click here to see for yourself. Gotta love that they have the Capt. Lawrence Liquid Gold and the Victory Golden Monkey on there. LET US KNOW OF ANY OTHER BURGER + BEER DEALS YOU KNOW ABOUT!

As Expected, Daniel Gets a 4-Spot From Bruni
***AUTHOR
Andy
***DATE
2009-01-21 07:44:00
***CONTENT
The review is out. Bruni has revisited Daniel for the NYTimes, this time after the restaurant's massive (and massively expensive) makeover. He begins, \"If you haven’t dined at Daniel in the last four and a half months, you haven’t dined at Daniel.\" And the best news is that there is perhaps no better time to dine at Daniel. Despite undoubtedly trying to recoup its sizeable investment in the re-design, Daniel is offering a 3-course $98 \"Anniversary/Recession Special\" that includes wine pairings (Mon-Thurs 5:30-6:30). Bruni's Daniel experience was not perfect, however. He writes, \"I had a few entrees, like bacon-wrapped monkfish with tough lobster in the middle, that lacked almost any inspiration or finesse. The kitchen made basic missteps, like overcooking the chop in that beguiling lamb tableau.\" Perhaps Bruni was too overtaken by the decor to penalize the food. He almost admits as much when he says: \"Daniel was always fancy; now it’s genuinely gorgeous, too. And that’s almost reason enough to reaffirm the four stars the restaurant was awarded by William Grimes in The New York Times in 2001.\" The only question we have for Daniel is why Wined & Dined commenter jackieono was not offered the $98 Anniversary Special back on January 14, 2009 at her 6pm reservation. She had heard about the special 3-course prix fixe and according to a comment she left on our site it was never presented to her party as an option. For those interested, you can read the NYTimes 2001 Daniel review here.

Drink Obama Beers Tonight: Ommegang's Inauguration Ale (aka, Obamagang) & Sixpoint's Hop Obama
***AUTHOR

2009-01-20 16:01:00
***CONTENT
We just got news that Cooperstown, NY brewer Ommegang has unveiled a special Obama Beer to commemorate today's inauguration. You can try Ommegang's Obamagang tonight at NYC beer bars Hop Devil Grill and David Copperfield's. According to BeerMenus you can also get your Obamagang (6.2% abv) fix at Puck Fair and Rattle 'n' Hum. Brooklyn-based brewer Sixpoint Craft Ales unleashed its Hop Obama several months ago. You can find this one at Cherry Tree Bar and PDT. Here is a description of the Obamagang that we received by email: The TTB won’t let us call the beer Obamagang on the keg label. So it will be known legally as Inauguration Ale 2009, but the tap handles will be more...um...direct. The style lies between a porter and stout, with a bit of Kriek and a touch of chocolate blended in. It will be on draft only, beginning with the inauguration - in limited areas including DC, NYC, Syracuse, Philly, Chicago and Boston. We will donate a percentage of sales to charities in the respective cities where the beer is sold, and we’ve asked our distributors to match our donations and pick the local charities. (Also please note that the beer is not an endorsement of Obama.)

Unfortunately, Hop Obama is probably not available anywhere. PDT and Cherry Tree's beer menus are out of date. Sixpoint stopped making Hop Obama a while ago and it is not available anywhere we know of. I had the Obamagang tonight thought and it is great. A nice dark stout-like brew with hints of cherry.

BYO Goes High-End: Alto First to \"Un-Wined\" the Paradigm
***AUTHOR
Andy
***DATE
2009-01-20 11:07:00
***CONTENT
First it was a slew of \"Recession Specials\", then it was the migration from a \"Restaurant Week\" to a \"Restaurant Year,\" now it appears the latest move by high-end restaurants and restaurateurs to adapt to these ever-worsening economic conditions is to soften their BYO policy. It is certainly true that restaurants with expensive and extensive wine lists do not normally encourage or allow customers to \"bring their own.\" To discourage this, most high-end restaurants charge an exhorbitant \"corkage fee,\" as high as $95 at some restaurants. Now that there are fewer and fewer customers, it appears the rules may be changing. We just read this story in the NY Post that Alto is waiving its $60 corkage fee on any bottle of wine between now and September (1 bottle per table). Why is it especially significant and why do we feel this move by Alto will shift the paradigm, you ask? Consider that Alto was just 1 of 3 recipients in 2008 of the highly coveted Wine Spectator Grand Award (click on the image). The Grand Award recognizes wine lists with upwards of 1,500 selections that exhibit vintage depth as well an excellent breadth of major wine growing regions. In fact, only 72 restaurants worldwide hold this distinction. So, if Alto with its WS Grand Award and a 3-star NY Times review is feeling the pain, we have no doubt that other high-end restaurants are feeling it, too. As an advocate of diner interests, Wined & Dined is going to begin reaching out to other NYC restaurants to see if they will follow suit and waive their BYO corkage fee for customers. We will begin with Drew Nieporent's Myriad Restaurant Group (Corton, Tribeca Grill, Centrico, and Mai House). Why this restaurant group? Because Myriad is also the owner of one of our favorite wine shops in the city, Crush Wine & Spirits. I'm sure they can think of a creative way to drive traffic (and bottles of wine) from Crush to one of the Myriad restaurants around the city. We think it makes pretty good sense for Myriad to waive corkage fees on any bottles of wine purchased at its sister wine shop. We'll let you know what they say. Apparently, Nieporent and other restaurateurs are no stranger to softening their BYO policy during hard economic times. We dug up this NY Times piece from 2003 when in the wake of the bursting of the dot-com bubble, restaurants around the city switched gears and allowed customers to bring in their own wine without a fee. One of those restaurants was Montrachet, a former Myriad Group restaurant. According to the 2003 NY Times story, one restaurant that does not allow customers (other than Robert Parker, Jr.) to bring their own wine (even for a corkage fee) is Daniel and according to another NY Post BYO story from May 2008, neither do Del Posto, BLT Steak or Cru. We'll also reach out to them and see if perhaps they will change their minds now. And for all the diners out there who are hesitant to bring their own wine for fear of backlash from the server, remember this: a tip on a smaller bill is better than no tip at all!

You may already know by now that The Sunburnt Cow in the way East Village is one of Jill and my favorite all-you-can-drink Sunday Fun-Day brunch spots in the city. We just got an email from Team Sunburnt Cow-Bondi Road that there will be huge parties at both restaurants next Monday in celebration of Australia Day. Also known as Anniversary Day, Foundation Day and Invasion Day, Australia Day is the official national day of Australia. Celebrated annually on January 26th, the day commemorates the arrival of the First Fleet in 1788, marking the start of British colonization of Australia. There are 2 ways to party at The Sunburnt Cow and Bondi Road next Monday: they are offering an $18 \"Endless Brunch\" featuring endless breakfast cocktails and Foster's and a $20=2 Hours of drinking as much as you can. Only problem is that we have to work. Maybe Australia Day and MLK Day will coincide one of these years.

More Restaurant Week \"Substitution Specials\": Chinatown Brasserie Joins Growing List

***CONTENT
We received an email over the weekend that the owners of Chinatown Brasserie have agreed to give diners a choice of a glass of wine in place of the dessert course, with the purchase of a glass of wine, a deal that we're calling the \"Substitution Special.\" Here's how it works: instead of choosing a dessert from the menu you can order any wine by the glass off the wine list and you will get 2 glasses with your dinner for the price of 1. Pretty darn good deal for wine drinkers! So, say you're out to dinner with a friend at Chinatown Brasserie and decide to order off the Restaurant Week menu. Your friend likes Sauvignon Blanc and orders a glass of the Francis Coppola ($10/glass) and you go with the Slipstream Shiraz ($11/glass). For $21, you will be getting 4 glasses total, or the equivalent of a bottle (perhaps more if you have a heavy-handed bartender)! RW dinner for 2 with equivalent of bottle of wine for $91 before tax and tip.

Hats off to Cafe des Artistes! Not only are they offering Restaurant Week all year long, they sent us a response email this morning saying that our proposal to see if any restaurants would substitute a glass of wine for the dessert course is \"a great idea!\" and \"that they would love to do it....\" We are trying to get the specifics of what Cafe des Artistes will allow diners to substitute for the dessert course, but it certainly appears that they are agreeing to a glass of wine. We're also trying to discover whether this \"substitution special\" will apply for their Restaurant Year or just during the next 2 weeks of Restaurant Week. We'll keep you posted as we learn more.

We received another response to our request sent out yesterday to see which restaurants participating in Restaurant Week would be willing to provide some alternative to diners who do not typically eat a dessert course. As if Terrance Brennan's Artisanal didn't announce enough good stuff yesterday (click here to see Grub Street's report that Artisanal has expanded with a Monday 'comfort food night' and is also adding a grilled cheese bar), we received an email this morning from Team Artisanal-Picholine that \"In lieu of the dessert course, guests at Artisanal during restaurant week can choose a Cheese Plate that will include an Aged Cheddar from Vermont and a Mimolette from France served with Walnut Chutney\" AND \"is offering all dinner guests during RW (not lunch) a $25 gift card to Artisanal's sister restaurant, Picholine.\" We reported last week that Picholine has expanded its 'Recession Special' menu, aka its Menu d'Economie.

Tired of going to dozens and dozens of individual restaurant websites to see who's offering what on their Restaurant Week menu? While the official Restaurant Week website does make available menus for about 80 of the participating restaurants here, there are more than 250 restaurants participating this year. As the start of RW draws nearer, more and more restaurants have been updating their websites with their RW menus. Here are the ones we've found so far (that you won't find on the official Restaurant Week website): Amma: lunch / dinner (note the $25 wine flight offer for lunch and dinner) Apiary: dinner Asia de Cuba: lunch / dinner (note that Asia de Cuba is making its RW menus available after RW through March 31st -- but dinner menu will only be available Sun-Wed) See more RW menus, after the jump... Asiate: Lunch only. From reviews we've read, Asiate is one of the few restaurants that does not change its menu for RW, which is nice. Outside of RW, Asiate offers a 2-course lunch for $24 w/ desserts offered at an additional $12. Throwing in dessert (though you know how we feel about this) truly makes Asiate one of the better RW lunch deals. Not to mention it's the best view you'll have at any RW restaurant.

We just received an email from Patina Restaurant Group (Brasserie, Brasserie 8 1/2, Nick & Stef's, Cafe Centro, Naples 45, The Sea Grill, etc) in response to our complaint from earlier that the dessert course makes Restaurant Week deals less sweet. Here it is: Just read your piece about the problems with Restaurant Week and agree. I’m happy to tell you that the Patina Restaurant Group understands the concern diners like yourself have as it relates to the cost of a drink during this rough economy. So, in addition to the participation of most of their restaurants in Restaurant Week, they’ve gone ahead and provided a boost to those wishing to wine and dine with two promotions. The first promotion is featured at Cucina & Co. (MetLife Building) and consists of a three course dinner (app, entrée and dessert) AND a glass of wine for $19.50…besting all current Restaurant Week options. I’ve attached a flier for it. The second special program is featured at most of the Patina Restaurant Group restaurants in NYC, LA and NJ. I’ve included the press announcement below but to summarize – it’s called “Wines for the Wise” and all bottles of wine (red, white, bubbly or otherwise) are now 25% off through March 31. Again, please see press release for full details. I hope that you’ll let your readers know that someone out there understands and is making good on your request. Click here to see where you can get 25% off bottles of wine and find more details on the Cucina & Co. special, after the jump... CUCINA & CO.'S \"DINNER FOR TWO\" SPECIAL Choice of APPETIZER, ONE entrée & dessert $15.50 per person.

Trying to Help You Get the Most Out Of 'Restaurant Week'
***AUTHOR
Andy
***DATE
2009-01-15 09:53:00
***CONTENT
The 2-weeks of 'Winter Restaurant Week' kick off this Sunday, the 18th. Top restaurants all over the city will be serving up 3-course lunches and dinners for $24.07 and $35, respectively. In the past, the deal was only good on weekedays and some of the top-tier restaurants refused to participate, but this year, thanks to the economy, NYC Restaurant Week has been expanded to include Sunday's and the list of participating restaurants has ballooned to more than 250, the largest group in its 18-year history. A few restaurants are even offering the deal on Saturday. Many restaurants have already been in 'Restaurant Week' mode for several weeks now, offering attractive 'Recession Specials' to lure diners in this ever-souring economy. With the sad news from Steven Hanson's BR Guest empire yesterday of several restaurant closings and these ominous predictions former Chef Fabio Trabocchi of Fiamma relayed to Frank Bruni during a phone call, there is no doubt that restaurants are stepping up their efforts in a major way, as Steven Hanson puts it, \"to hug the customer.\" Find out our biggest Restaurant Week gripe, and our proposed solution, after the jump... While Restaurant Week certainly provides a great opportunity to affordably dine at some of the city's most expensive restaurants, our single biggest problem with Restaurant Week is that we are not dessert eaters. We maybe order dessert with dinner once or twice a year...Birthdays, so we can stick a candle in something, and Valentine's Day. In fact, nobody that we know who dines frequently in the city orders desserts...especially in January when they are trying to stay true to New Year's resolutions. When you factor out dessert and factor in a glass or two of wine and/or cocktails, a Restaurant Week meal can become an expensive outing. Hanson said in his interview that the solution is to cater to diners. We are ready to be catered to and \"hugged.\" Here's our thoughts: Beginning today we are reaching out to participating restaurants to see if any of them are ready to step it up in a MAJOR WAY. What we are asking is this: give diners a choice -- a desssert course OR a glass of house wine (not asking for a 2005 first-growth Bordeaux, but something towards the bottom of the wine list). If that's too much to ask, then restaurants can get creative with this and perhaps do a buy 1 glass, get 1 glass option in lieu of dessert. From our experience (and market research), people will order an additional glass of wine or cocktail when they receive one for free. Guess who we're reaching out to first? We'll let you know the responses we get. Wish us luck.

I don't think you can beat GT's deals -- $24.07 gift certificate and bottles of wine for $24.07 at lunch -- problem is they only are offering Restaurant Week menu for lunch and only Mon-Fri....also GT books up the first day they take reservations for Restaurant Week...though i hear it's first come-first serve in the front part of the restaurant. Have to be either a tourist or homemaker to take advantage of this one. unfortunately, i'm usually at my desk during lunch.

No, we haven't been to any of the Smorgas Chef's in the city...but we seem to come across these Scandinavian-themed restaurants wherever we go. There's one near us in Midtown, another one in the heart of the W. Village, one in the FiDi on Stone Street and another on Park Avenue b/t 37th and 38th. There's no better time than now to try it out. We just found this special on the Village Voice website: Dear Voice Reader, We are celebrating the opening of our 4th restaurant on Park Avenue by offering our guests a free bottle of wine at any of our 4 places. Enjoy! HERE'S HOW: Write to villagewine@smorgas.com to receive your printable wine gift card.

We got a bit nervous yesterday when we read on Grub Street that \"Kuma Inn got a thumbs-up for a new license (good-bye, BYO!)\" and on Eater that Kuma Inn got approved \"for a new license separate from the one they've apparently been sharing with a restaurant downstairs.\" We reached out to Kuma Inn earlier today to get the scoop on whether its BYO is now DOA. We received this email from Kuma Inn a little while ago: From: Kuma Inn Subject: Kuma Inn BYO Thank you for your interest in Kuma Inn. Kuma Inn is currently still BYO. We are in the process of applying for a beer/wine restaurant license. Approval from the local community board is the first step in a long process. **Kuma Inn has a $5 corkage fee and is cash only**

If you missed all the hot spots booking up two months in advance, Wednesday is your day to take advantage of the restaurants that take reservations one month in advance of Valentine's Day. Think Bouley, Little Owl, Babbo, The House... and get ready for some serious speed dialing and busy signals. Good Luck! p.s. if I didn't already have reservations, I'd be jumping on this open 9pm reservation at La Sirene, a quaint French bistro BYO in Soho that's offering a 4-course prix-fixe for $69.

By George! City Crab & Seafood Co. Has a Huge Heart...and a Recession Special
***AUTHOR
Andy
***DATE
2009-01-12 04:57:00
***CONTENT
In what is perhaps the feel-good story of early 2009, City Crab on Park Avenue agreed this past Friday to release back to the sea an approximately 140 year-old 20 lb. lobster named \"George.\" City Crab had purchased the lobster that was caught off the coast of Canada a couple weeks ago for about $100. We first heard about City Crab's tremendous gesture early Saturday morning and decided to head over there on Sunday to see if we could get some more info on this story that has been receiving national and international attention. According to a manager, Tom, who sat down to speak with us, calls have been flooding in from all over the world to show appreciation for the restaurant's compassion. \"We had no idea the reaction we would get from releasing George, but it just seemed like the right thing to do,\" said the manager. \"We have been receiving calls from people in Italy, Canada and New Zealand to thank us and an 8-year-old girl even called up yesterday crying and pleading for us not to release George into waters 'where he's just going to get caught again.'\" Apparently no one had told the young girl that PETA drove George up to Kennebunkport, Maine and released the 20 lb lobster in protected waters less than a mile from former President George H.W. Bush's summer home. More on this story and if you can still bring yourself to eating a lobster, a big Recession Special offer for Wined & Dined readers, after the jump... In a blog post on the PETA website, PETA writes that the next step is to \"ban catching lobsters completely.\" We asked Tom if he feels the decision to release the lobster could set a dangerous precedent for City Crab and other restaurants as far as PETA is concerned. He said he doesn't think so and responded that the vast majority of lobsters City Crab sells are in the 2-2.5 lb. range with a few reaching as big as 4-5 lbs. This gives you an idea of just how big \"George\" is and how unusual it is for a restaurant to get its hands on a 20 lb. lobster. He thinks, if anything, this will lead to some restaurants \"scaling down the size of the lobsters they buy and sell.\" We then asked Tom how City Crab has been faring in these tough economic times. He said they are feeling the effects of the recession like most big Manhattan restaurants. Many of the big companies and firms around the city that typically hold their holiday parties at City Crab bowed out of their holiday party reservations at the end of last year. In terms of special offers to lure diners, Tom said that City Crab is currently running a promotion for 15% off your meal. The catch is you have to have already dined at City Lobster and filled out a promotion card with your email address and other info. As if releasing George hasn't already built enough goodwill and PR for the restaurant, City Crab told us they will honor the 15% off deal on-the-spot for customers (without having to wait until a return visit) that mention they heard about it AND if you order a lobster that is 2 lbs. or bigger, City Crab will give you 1.25 lbs. of lobster for free. And for all you PETA fanatics out there, all we can offer you is this.

Recession Special en francais? Picholine Set to Expand its Menu d'Economie

Doesn't everything sound better in French? Bien sur! We got word today that due to increasing popularity, Picholine will be expanding its Menu d'Economie, aka its 'Value Dining Experience', otherwise known as a 'Recession Special', that was originally launched in early December. Until now, the Menu d'Economie has been available each evening at the Cheese and Wine Bar, but only in the Dining Room when tables are available. Picholine will be announcing in the coming days that the Menu d'Economie will be offered in the Dining Room by reservation Monday through Thursday after 9 pm. It will also remain available in the Cheese and Wine Bar each night all night long. It really is one of the better Recession Specials we've come across. It's also the best name we've seen for a Recession Special menu. Sophisticated, yet approachable. The Menu d'Economie continues to feature a wide array of “tasting plates” (12 different half-portion entrées for $20), “tasting flights” (choose 3 from a selection of 15 dishes for $20), and 60 wines for under $60 a bottle. Picholine emphasized that these under $60 bottles include wines from producers such as \"Chateau Beaucastel, Etienne Sauzet, and Chateau Rayas.\" Picholine is one of just seven NYC restaurants to be awarded 2-stars in the 2009 Michelin Guide and is a 26 (food), 24 (decor), 25 (service) on Zagat. We'll be checking out this special for ourselves soon and will let you know what we think. To Chef Brennan, we say merci beaucoup!

With people celebrating far fewer business deals and expense accounts freezing up, perhaps nobody's feelin' the pain these days more than the high-end steak houses around the city. Here are some steak house recession specials we have recently happened upon: Center Cut @ The Empire Hotel is offering a special $39 menu available every day between 5-7pm and again after 10pm. You get a soup + salad in one course and an entree + side in a second course. They send you home with some fresh cookies for dessert. Heard from co-worker that it is an excellent deal. Morton's is offering a Dinner for 2 Special for $109. You get 2 single cut filets, a choice of 2 seafood appetizers, a potato and vegetable to share and a choice of 2 desserts. They are also offering one bottle of red and one bottle of white each night for $39. A few more steak house deals, including one with ALL-YOU-CAN-DRINK WINE and one DOUBLE RECESSION SPECIAL after the jump... Maloney & Porcelli is offering what it calls \"The Weekend Wine Dinner\" on Friday and Saturday nights after 8pm and on Sundays after 5pm. $75 per person gets you any appetizer, entree and dessert with unlimited pours of your choice of 4 featured wines! Zagat claims the waiters \"don't flinch\" in pouring the non-stop wine. Nick + Stef's is offering a Special Wine Dinner Prix Fixe. Every night after 8pm, for $45 you get an appetizer, entree and dessert + you get a complimentary glass of wine with both the appetizer and entree courses. Make this a Double Recession Special by using the 20% off discount (off the entire bill) offered by The Dish by AMEX promotion. Click here for more details. Click here to see why we think The Dish is a legit deal. Let's just say with tax + tip the meal comes out to $60 per person. Your AMEX bill will show a charge of $48, meaning the deal basically pays your tax + tip. Ruth's Chris is offering a Steak + Stuffed Lobster special for $39.95.

I started to write this before even finishing my Black Label Burger that I had delivered to me at my office from City Burger (for 10% off I should add). I think I may have two bites left (if i take really small bites) and I'm procrastinating cause I don't want to see it go. I didn't even get it fresh (it traveled a good ways in some inclement weather to find me) and I think I can say it was one of the best burgers I've had in a while, i.e. since Molly's. Man was I ready to bash it, denounce all the hypers out there and proudly proclaim Burger Joint as my defending favorite burger in Midtown...but I cannot. This burger epitomizes 'quality not quantity.' It's not gonna win any awards for it's brawn, but it's the juiciest, most flavorful burger I've had in a while. Not to mention, it was perhaps the pinkest, most perfectly prepared medium rare I've ever had. I'm glad to finally understand what the La Frieda mix hype is all about. Time for those two small bites. Go getcha some. Couple of more pics after the jump...

city burger is apparently on seamless web, too...which i use a ton at work. however, they don't show up as being in my delivery zone...i guess the delivery zone through the city burger website is larger.

Value Brunches at B.R. Guest Restaurants?

***CONTENT
Well, you know how much Andy and I love the all-you-can-drink brunch, but not every weekend day is fit for such an early all-out party. So, where do you go if you still want a great brunch at a good value? You would normally not expect a B.R. Guest Restaurant to be the answer, but with 9 NYC restaurants (Atlantic Grill, Ocean Grill, Isabella's, Blue Water Grill, Blue Fin, Primehouse NY, Dos Caminos Park, Soho, and 3rd Ave) offering reasonably priced brunch dishes that all come with a complimentary brunch cocktail, you really can find an amazing and high quality value brunch. Find out how the two of us enjoy a delicious brunch with frozen prickly pear margaritas for under $30 bucks, after the jump... So, the brunch menus do still have some pricey items, but if you stick with the basics as if you were in your neighborhood diner or favorite breakfast place, you can really get away with a deal in one of these spots- AND with much better service and a nicer ambiance. Yes, you don't have the cozy, country atmosphere you may enjoy at some of our other brunch faves, but you will certainly get great food and a quality cocktail. Andy and I head to our local Dos Caminos on 3rd Ave. often in the warmer months to enjoy brunch in the sun on their large outdoor patio. I order the wild mushroom and huitlachoche omelette (goat cheese, epazote and salsa verde) that comes with a generous portion of spicy home fries for $13 (AND a Frozen Prickly Pear margarita on the house that normally sells for $11). Andy changes it up every now and then, but he tends to like the Dos Caminos Chicken Cobb Salad (grilled chicken breast, tomato, avocado, chorizo, grilled corn, onion, and queso fresco cilantro-basil vinaigrette) for $15 (AND a spicy bloody mary on the house- cocktails normally run around $12). So we end up with a $28 brunch + tax and tip. For comparison, if we were to head to our our local Moonstruck diner, the greek omelette I normally order with added mushrooms would cost me $10.50 (and it would not be nearly as fluffy or use the same fresh ingredients as Dos does). Andy's Cobb salad would be $12.25 (and an extra $1.50 if he wanted it chopped). Total diner brunch= $22.75 + tax + tip. You may be saving $5 and change, but you've lost your fresh market ingredients, better service, nicer atmosphere, and (most importantly) your delicious brunch cocktails! Think about Isabella's Farmer's Market Egg White Omelette with turkey bacon, market vegetables, and tomato salsa with a glass of cold, crisp champagne for $12.50 the next time you pay $2 for every extra ingredient and $2 more for egg whites while ordering the greasy omelette from your local diner. Think real value. Check out the brunch menus: - Atlantic Grill - Blue Fin - Blue Water Grill - Dos Caminos Park Ave. - Dos Caminos 3rd Ave. - Dos Caminos Soho - Isabella's (Sunday Brunch) - Ocean Grill - Primehouse New York

City Burger Delivery! A Recession Special?

 It looks like my New Year's resolution didn't even last a week. After reading all the hooplah over the past month about City Burger's famed Pat La Frieda Black Label burger, including this rave review by A Hamburger Today, I decided to break down today and give it a shot. I was a bit reluctant to do so after caving and trying the overhyped Irving Mill pork fatback burger, which I found to be completely underwhelming. Now Broadway @ 39th St isn't exactly the most convenient of locations for Midtowners, especially in this weather. So, I checked out City Burger's website and what do you know, THEY DELIVER! I put in my information and discovered that everything on the menu is 10% off. Actually, just got a call and it's here...gotta run, will let you know what I thought soon!

Recession Specials Disguised as Anniversary Specials?
***AUTHOR
Andy
***DATE
2009-01-06 10:39:00
***CONTENT
By now it's no secret that restaurants all over the city are luring diners to the table by offering up \"recession special\" prix-fixe menus. With the recession predicted to last through 2010, you can rest assured that more and more restaurants will be following suit. However, many big-name restaurateurs with fine-dining destinations loathe the idea of offering such specials fearing it sends a message of desperation. They oppose discounting for fear that consumers will undervalue the level of food and service provided. There's also always the concern on the diner's part that the food or service will suffer if the prices are lowered, aka the 'Restaurant Week Effect.' So in these tough times 'big ego' restaurants (you know, the ones that would rather tell you that they do not have a table for 2 at 8pm on a Friday night than appear to be struggling) must walk a fine line in strategizing to keep their tables filled, but without losing their swagger in the process. Jean-Georges put aside his hubris in becoming the first of the big name restaurateurs to offer up $24 lunch and $35 dinner recession specials at his NYC restaurants. I think in doing so he is building customer loyalty and good-will. When this economy turns around, I for one will be patroniozing the restaurants that showed compassion and generosity during the tough times. Learn a new strategy being employed by some of the city's top dining destinations after the jump... We have come upon what appears to be a new strategy employed by some restaurateurs who want to lure diners without sounding desperate for business: disguise the Recession Special as an Anniversary Special. Take the famed and highly-acclaimed Four Seasons Restaurant for instance. To celebrate 1959, the year the Four Seasons opened its doors, the restaurant is offering a $59 three-course prix-fixe menu throughout 2009 for lunch and dinner in the Pool Room, featuring lobster and black truffle risotto, shrimp and their famous farmhouse duck. We just learned yesterday that Restaurant Daniel is offering from now through March 2009 a 15th Anniversary Celebration Menu. This $98 three-course prix-fixe menu comes with wine pairings. The only catch is that it is only offered Monday through Thursday from 5:30-6:30pm. These sound like recession specials in anniversary menu clothing to me. Typically, restaurants only offer aniversary menus on a one-night or one weekend basis, while these are being offered over a course of months. And c'mon, who's really doing any celebrating these days?

Restaurant Daniel Announces First Ever Beer-Pairing Dinners: Is Beer the New Wine for '09?

***DATE

***CONTENT
In a time when we are all facing the harsh realities of a declining global economy, one of the big food and wine trends for 2009 predicted by thefoodpeople, a British-based food trend consultancy, is a shift in drinking habits with more in-home drinking as well as a rise in the popularity of beer, cider and cocktails. Flavor & The Menu magazine, a publication specializing in trends and forecasts in the food industry, predicted that the top culinary trend of 2009 would be \"Tapping Beer's Potential,\" writing \"now that beer is the new wine, thanks to a flood of new craft beer products and imports, chefs are creating menus that match beer lists in their complexity and casual-yet-sophisticated approcah to pub food.\" Also, just this past Friday, Eric Asimov of the NYTimes ran a story on a $35 barrel-aged bottle of beer called Abbaye de Saint Bon-Chien. He says that many luxury beers like this one go well with foods ranging from seafood and cheeses to chocolate. In what may be a sign of the times, or just sheer coincidence, Daniel Boulud's NYC flagship restaurant Daniel just announced its first ever beer-pairing dinners set for January 27 and 28th. The email says that these luxury beer dinners are in anticipation of the Spring '09 opening of DBGB, Boulud's more casual and hip 'brasserie meets luxe diner' in the Avalon Bowery Place apartment building. People had speculated that DBGB would be a burger place akin to BLT Burger. Boulud dispelled those rumors in this NYPost interview back in September. Find out more on the beer-pairing dinners and other food and drink trends for 2009 after the jump... The beer tastings at Restaurant Daniel will feature Kasteel Cru's Alsatian lager in addition to signature cocktails made with beer. The dinner opens with these beer-infused cocktails followed by a four-course dinner paired with luxury beers. The dinners are hosted by Samuel Merritt, President of the so-called 'Civilization of Beer,' and go for $135 per person (not including tip or gratuity). Oh yeah, in case you were wondering what some of the other predicted food trends are for 2009, click here and here.

New Year's Resolution #1 = Eat Healthy. So, why are we writing about donuts you ask? Because we recently discovered Holey Donuts - low fat, low calorie, amazingly delicious donuts. You can indulge (without really indulging) in a coconut cream pie, raspberry graham cracker, banana cream pie, or fudge crumb boston cream donut for 150-250 calories and 3-4 grams of fat! The average \"regular\" donut has 15-20 grams of fat and as much as 480 calories. Not only are they low fat/low calorie, they are truly delicious and there are tons of amazing flavors. Perfect solution to any craving for sweets and perfect way to keep new year's resolution #1 without sacrificing any taste! And they are selling their gourmet donuts today on QVC @ 1 p.m. If you are too busy watching football, check out their website where you can order online. Trust us... they're worth it.

Boozy Brunch: Roberto Passon

***CONTENT
There is no better deal than an all you can drink brunch in NYC and there is no better deal for an all you can drink brunch than Roberto Passon in Hells Kitchen (741 Ninth Avenue at 50th Street). With no brunch items over $12 and with unlimited brunch cocktails (champagne, mimosas, screwdrivers, bloody marys, or strawberry/kiwi/peach bellinis) at $8 per person, it has to be one of if not the best brunch deal in NYC. Thanks to Wined & Dined commenter Dan for recommending it to us. More on our AYCD brunch at Roberto Passon and a new boozy brunch restaurant group discovery after the jump... First of all, unlike some boozy brunch destinations, Roberto Passon lets you switch between cocktails so you can try them all out if you would like. Second of all, unlike some Italian restaurants that do brunch, Roberto Passon had an extensive selection of traditional brunch items. You can select from breakfast items such as french toast, pancakes, eggs benedict and omelets, in addition to the expected paninis, salads, pastas, and meat and fish choices. And the prices are ridiculous- the most expensive item being the grilled salmon with spinach at $12 (seriously). Andy had the fusilli with chicken, tomato and bacon for $9 and it was delicious. It was flavorful, spicy, creamy, and the fusilli was perfectly al dente. I was in the mood for something relatively light so I had the Caesar salad with grilled shrimp for $9. The salad was crisp and the Caesar dressing authentic. I also found the grilled shrimp to be seasoned well. It went very well with the massive glasses of bubbly that were poured generously and refilled constantly. Once my first large wine glass of champagne was poured, I was instantly reminded of Il Bastardo, another favorite all you can drink brunch spot in Chelsea. I checked out the Roberto Passon website and I learned that Roberto Passon is owned by the New York City Restaurant Group (NYCRG). The NYCRG owns three (now four) all you can drink brunch spots that I've been to countless times- Nero in Meatpacking, Il Bastardo in Chelsea, and Arte Cafe on the UWS. They also own Bar Baresco, Bocca Bacco, Gallo Nero, Zucchero e Pomodori, Cara Mia, Intermezzo, Maria Pia, film center cafe, Scarlatto, and Puttanesca. Their aim is to \"provide delicious food at inexpensive prices\" and boy do they succeed at boozy brunches. Cheers to NYCRG- keep up the great work!

Good call- $16 for a brunch item served with home fries, salad, and bottomless mimosas or bloody marys is quite a recession special. Can you get the steak & eggs or burger with that deal?

Beer With Benefits?

While most college students spend their free time drinking beer, a group of students at Rice University are experimenting with it. They're using genetic engineering to create beer, aptly named \"BioBeer,\" that contains resveratrol, a chemical in red wine that's been shown to reduce cancer and heart disease in lab animals. Resveratrol, found in the skin of red grapes, has been linked with the so-called 'French Paradox', a phrase used to describe the low incidence of heart disease and obesity among the French, despite their relatively high-fat diet and levels of wine consumption. More on BioBeer and even more reason to drink IPAs after the jump...To create their BioBeer, the students are attempting to genetically alter a strain of yeast so that it produces resveratrol while also fermenting beer. Ironically, most of the team's undergrad members aren't even old enough to legally drink beer. The team at Rice is currently working with Texas-based Saint Arnold Brewing Company to synthesize the antioxidant from the amino acid tyrosine. They do not expect the resveratrol to affect the taste of the beer since the chemical is tasteless and odorless. Resveratrol is already found in low levels in hops, the raw ingredient of beer. So while we wait for BioBeer to hit the shelves, we recommend drinking IPAs, the hoppiest of beers, to get your resveratrol. Here are some of our faves: Bear Republic Racer 5, Stone Ruination, Southern Tier Unearthly, Lagunitas Maximus, Dogfish Head 90 Minute, Green Flash West Coast and Great Divide Hercules.

The wonder ingredient in wine is indeed resveratrol. Dr. David Sinclair, Associate Professor of Pathology and Co-Director of the Laboratories for the Biological Mechanisms of Aging at Harvard Medical School is the leader in research into the anti-aging properties of resveratrol. The current studies performed by Dr. Sinclair and many other researchers have shown great promise for resveratrol treating the diseases of aging. There are numerous articles that I have linked to at my website - http://resveratrol.webiage.com - that document the findings for the potential health benefits in treating heart disease, cancer, diabetes, osteoporosis, obesity, and other diseases.

Wines Til Sold Out: Our Favorite (and Cheapest) Way to Buy Wine
***AUTHOR
Andy
***DATE

***CONTENT
Here's our gift to you this holiday season. I first discovered WinesTilSoldOut.com (WTSO) last year in a small advertisement in the back of an issue of New York Magazine. I decided to go online and see what it was all about. Since then, we've purchased no less than 100 bottles of wine through this site at unbelievable prices (and with free shipping). The wines WTSO sells run the gamut from $5.99 bottles of Prosecco to the most expensive Bordeaux and Burgandy out there. I bought a bottle of 1995 Château Latour in a WTSO marathon (will explain below what a 'marathon' is) for $250, which now sells for $1,100 a bottle at Sherry-Lehmann in NYC. On the opposite end, Jill ordered us 4 bottles of Cava just last week at $9.99 a bottle. Here's how it works: WTSO sells one type of wine per day until it is sold out or until 11:59pm eastern standard time, when it is replaced. If that bottle sells out early, WTSO will then add another wine (but no more than 3 wines per day). WTSO ships to 32 states. Click here to see if they ship to you. When you sign up (free) you get an email each morning with the wine of the day, including the description of the wine, available ratings and price, and a comparison of the lowest price on the web for the same bottle. If it's nothing of interest to you, simply delete the email and wait for the next one. If an offering piques your interest, I suggest jumping on it, since the best deals tend to sell out quite quickly. The 40 or so people I have told about the site are mostly WTSO regulars now and the great deals are selling out faster as the customer base grows. Find out some insane deals we've taken advantage of and what a WTSO marathon is, after the jump... I was looking back at some of my old receipts from WTSO this morning, and these stuck out as ridic deals: 3 bottles of Casanova di Neri Brunello di Montalcino Tenuta Nuova 2000 for $33.99/bottle -- currently retails for anywhere b/t $50-80. Oh yeah, and the 2001 vintage was Wine Spectator's Wine of the Year for 2006. 3 bottles of Le Vieux Donjon Chateauneuf du Pape Blanc 2004 for $29.99/bottle - currently retails for $45.99/bottle at Sherry-Lehmann 6 bottles of Caliterra Cabernet Sauvignon Reserva 2005 for $7.99/bottle - currently retails for anywhere b/t $11-13. This is a great Chilean value wine. JUST TODAY WE PURCHASED 2 BOTTLES OF DOMAINE HUMBERT FRERES GEVREY-CHEVERTIN 2005 BURGANDY FOR $39.99/bottle -- currently retails for anywhere b/t $55-75. Over the past week, WTSO has been offering one of our favorite wine producers, Mollydooker, at great price-points. Also, be sure on the lookout for WTSO Marathons -- days when WTSO sells a variety of wines (24-80 different wines, depending on the type of marathon) from midnight to midnight. You receive an email notice of the marathon about a week before it runs with a short description of the products being featured. You also receive an email at the start of the marathon.

Five Festive Faves: Where to Find all the Holiday Cheer (and Beer)

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas... well, okay, it has been looking like Christmas for a while here in NYC, but we've just put together a list of our 5 favorite festive spots if you are looking for some extra NYC holiday cheer. Beware, if you hit up too many of these classics, you may just break out into uncontrollable carolling. Enjoy! 1. Rolf's French Bavarian Brasserie: It does not get more festive than this German (now French Bavarian) eatery located in Gramercy on 21st and 3rd Ave. Picture yourself dining or drinking inside a giant Christmas tree. They were nevery really known for their food, but with a new chef (Adalbert Rasemborg) it may be worth a try. Find four more festive faves after the jump... 2. Waterfront Ale House: I know you must be wondering how Waterfront Ale managed to get on this list, but we have to include the birth place of our favorite egg nog ever! Head to 30th and 2nd Ave for Sam's Serious Egg Nog (made with 3 rums + bourbon)- it is by far the most serious egg nog in town AND you can share this holiday treat, because they serve this magic by the bottle. Also be sure to try the Anchor Christmas on-tap. Here's the full beer list from BeerMenus. Bottoms up... 3. Pulse at Rockefeller Center: Now, there is nothing more festive that checking out the tree and skating rink at Rockefeller Center, but who wants to spend exorbitant amounts of money on mediocre food at the tourist trap restaurants surrounding all that holiday goodness? New York Magazine's Holiday Guide recommends the \"semi-secret restaurant at Sports Club/LA\" for a \"bird's eye view of the tree and an Asian accented menu.\" If you gotta do it, check it out at 45 Rockefeller Plaza and 50th Street. 4. Zum Schneider: People have a tendency to break out in Christmas song at one of our favorite Biergartens on Avenue C and 7th Street. Maybe that's because they host a carolling every year, with song book and back up music (Check It Out Here). Even if you miss the official carolling, Zum Schneider is a fun festive place to knock back some serious steins of German brews and to perform your own drunken rendition of Rudolf the Red Nose Reindeer. 5. Celsius @ Bryant Park: In case you haven't noticed, there is a giant glass-enclosed two-story, 7,000 foot structure sitting beside the ice-skating rink at Bryant Park, including a huge balcony with outdoor heat lamps. The Buddha Bar team has crafted a \"Canadian-themed\" comfort food menu replete with menu items such as chili, mac n' cheese, sliders, \"chilly\" dogs, fish and chips and more. What holiday would be complete without a lawsuit? Apparently, Bryant Park Grill was none too pleased with the added competition for customers in this economy (here's more on the \"food fight\" that erupted in Bryant Park). Don't worry...Wined & Dined is staying out of this one.

Matsugen: Really a Recession \"Gift\" from Jean-Georges?

As previously reported on Wined & Dined, Jean-Georges Vongerichten described his \"Gift to You This Season\" as his $24 prix-fixe lunches and his $35 prix-fixe dinners at most of his NYC restaurants. He called the \"best deal, by far\" the 6 course mini-omakase dinner at Matsugen in TriBeCa, described by Zagat as a \"Japanese soba house gone 'upscale.'\" So, in the middle of a winter storm with snow falling heavily, Andy and I were off to Church and Leonard Street to receive our gift. See what we thought of Jean-Georges' heartfelt recession special after the jump... The $35 Menu: Wasabi Nuts - Grilled Edamame - Madai Usuzukuri with Soy Wasabi - Black Cod with Miso OR 4 Pieces of Sushi - Chicken Meatballs - Kamoseiro Duck Soup with Soba Noodles - Vanilla Caramel Pudding (Plus Homemade Soft Tofu that we ordered a la carte for $8). The Verdict: Overall we were very happy with our gift from Jean-Georges. It is quite a deal after all and we also found a reasonably priced bottle of Gewurtz that we thoroughly enjoyed. Pretty amazing any time you can get out of a JG restaurant under $150 (including tip) for dinner for 2 and a bottle of wine. It was definitely a small bite tasting menu and the courses did not come separately. We received our wasabi nuts, grilled edamame, and madai usuzukuri while we were still enjoying our fresh soft tofu (excellent, by the way). Andy's 4 pieces of sushi came at the same time as his chicken meatballs and my black cod with miso arrived after all my little chicken meatballs were gone. We could not believe we were finished with a full 6 courses (7 if you add in our tofu) in about an hour! AND Andy was still hungry for more after our last course. Despite a quick moving and haphazard serving style, we really did enjoy the food and for $35 it is a steal. I include a list of our favorites below. Thanks Jean-Georges and if you're still feeling generous, we're ready for some more presents! Favorites: - The Madai Usuzukuri with Soy Wasabi (sashimi style red snapper) - Chicken Meatballs (delicious and not what I was expecting at all- they burst with flavor) - Kamoseiro Duck Soup with Soba Noodles (and we received a little lesson on how to dip our cold soba noodles in the steaming tasty duck broth- very tasty...it was also a nice surprise when the broth in which the noodles cooked was added at the end of the meal to our remaining duck broth so we did not miss out on any of the soba nutrients) Tip: I would recommend the Miso Cod over the traditional 4 pieces of sushi. Andy couldn't help his wandering chopsticks from crossing the table for my cod. Kamoseiro Duck Soup with Soba Noodles Black Cod with Miso

North Fork Nirvana: Our Weekend In Long Island Wine Country

***CONTENT
This time of year is wining and dining season for us. Andy's parents were in the city this Thanksgiving for 10 (gluttonous) days and were excited to try out some of our favorite spots around town. Among many others, we hit up Kuma Inn, Buddakan, Stage Deli, and Mia Dona. But even with all these great meals, we were most excited for our weekend in Long Island's North Fork wine region. We had planned the perfect winter weekend getaway -- a stay at The North Fork Table & Inn (and dinner there Saturday night), a dinner at The Frisky Oyster in Greenport, and of course visits and tastings at several of the North Fork's 53 wineries and vineyards. Highlights from our fantastic NOFO weekend after the jump... Andy and I think that the North Fork of Long Island is the perfect weekend getaway from NYC. It has everything- the beach, the wineries, the marinas, the great local restaurants, and it still has the rustic, country feel (that the Hamptons is certainly missing)- so we were excited to share our favorite weekend away destination with Andy's parents, Donna and Charles, my Mom, Barbara, and Jacquie and Gary. Day 1, Friday: We left the city early to avoid all the weekend traffic and were in the NOFO in a couple of quick hours. First stop on our gourmet tour of the North Fork was Love Lane Kitchenin Mattituck. Lunch was excellent. I had the butternut squash soup and then Donna and I split a lobster roll and grilled vegggie and goat cheese panini. Andy and Charles split a grilled swordfish sandwich and an amazing-looking french dip. We also shared an order of sweet potato fries and garlic and rosemary fries for the table and washed it all down with some Circus Boy drafts. Delicious! Next it was time to explore the area a bit before checking in to The North Fork Table & Inn. We drove around Southold, Greenport, and Orient and watched the sun set over the water. Once it got dark, it was time to check into the Inn and pop open some wine. We had all four of The North Fork Table & Inn's rooms reserved, and it was great to have the whole place to ourselves. When we arrived, we walked right into the restaurant as the chef was going over the menu with all the staff and they were tasting all the evening's specials. It looked great, but we would have to wait for our NFT&I feast until Saturday night. My Mom, Jacquie, and Gary arrived and we all caught up in one of the rooms over a couple of glasses of wine (the only problem with the NFT&I is that there is no Inn common area- the living room is actually the restaurant!). Then we were off to Greenport for dinner at the Frisky Oyster. We arrived a 1/2 hour early to the restaurant, but we were able to snag a big lounge table in the front of the restaurant by the bar. We ordered some local bottles of red and white (including a Shinn Estate “First Fruit” White 2007 that we all agreed exemplifies the great 2007 growing season in Long Island) and and were seated in no time. Dinner was superb. The oysters \"friskafella\" were amazing- by far my favorite starter. Fresh oysters with spinach, parmesan, garlic, and chipotle... mmmmm.... The steamed P.E.I. mussels with chardonnay cream were also excellent. For my entree, I was very pleased with the crescent duck breast with \"hash\" of baby fennel, shiitake, and duck leg confit, although I do have to admit that Andy won with his braised short ribs. We got to meet sommelier, Eileen Duffy, who recommended a 2005 Paumanok Cabernet Franc (Donna's favorite of the weekend), and we also decided to go with another bottle of the Shinn Estate White. After some great food, great local wine, we decided to hit up the local bar across the street. We enjoyed a few games of pool, a couple rounds of darts, and some ice cold brews before we retired to the Inn. Day 2, Saturday: Can it get any better than waking up on a sunny crisp winter day and coming downstairs to the dining room to be greeted by Claudia Fleming (formerly of Gramercy Tavern and the winner of the James Beard Pastry Chef of the Year) with a piping hot dish of gruyere, vegetable, and bacon frittata? Nope, it cannot. The freshly baked assorted scones and muffins, the homemade granola, the fresh fruit, and the local goat's milk yogurt were all lovely additions to the morning spread. We all feasted on breakfast, sipped on our freshly squeezed juices and coffee, purused the morning paper, and then we were off to start our day of wine tasting. After another leisurely drive along the water and some house hunting adventures, we were ready for our first winery. Stop 1: Bedell Cellers in Cutchogue, New York. Andy and I loved coming to Bedell in the warmer months to enjoy their beautiful deck and outdoor tasting bar while listening to live music and making new friends. At this time of the year, it was certainly too chilly for the outdoor tasting bar, but we still enjoyed the modern tasting room that was renovated in 2001 and that looks more like a gallery than a winery. We did leave with a couple of bottles of wine, but Bedell is certainly on the more pricey side of NOFO wine, so we decided to save our case purchases for later in the day. Stop 2: Croteaux Vineyards in Southold, New York. Croteaux was truly a delight! I had never been to this winery before, and boy was I in for a treat. The tasting room is tiny and overwhelmingly charming. There was barely enough room for us all to sit around the bar and start tasting. Croteaux makes only rosés and I LOVE nothing more than a great rosé on a summer day (or in this case a freezing winter day). They make their rosés in the same style as those made in the South of France and all have a nice dry balance of fruit and acidity. All three rosés that we tasted were made from 100% merlot and my favorite (that I took home a few bottles of) was the 2007 Croteaux Merlot 181 Rosé- very light and delicate. I envisioned myself overlooking the beaches of Nice or Cannes with a glass of this in hand. The 2007 Croteaux Merlot 314 Rosé and the 2007 Croteaux Merlot 3 Rosé were also lovely and Donna, Charles, Jacquie, Gary, and Barbara all took home cases or bottles of all three. Paula Croteau, who owns Croteaux Vineyard with her husband, was so friendly and knowledgeable as she lead us through our tasting. She also told us all about her cooking school and offered us some delicious homemade white chocolate almond bark along with our wines. They also discount the cost of the tasting to the purchase of any wine, so we tasted for free and she was happy to pour seconds and thirds as we decided on our favorites. Stop 3: Shinn Estate Vineyards in Mattituch, New York. Andy and I have stayed at the Shinn Estate Farmhouse, the four bedroom inn on the vineyard property. Unfortunately, it was not available for our weekend away this time, but we would definitely recommend it. We were able, though, to make it to the Shinn Estate Vineyard for a great wine tasting. We sat in the tasting room in their renovated barn at a big table and began tasting away. We really enjoy these wines and took home a mixed case of red and whites. We coincidentally had a couple bottles of the 2007 \"First Fruit\" Sauvignon Blanc Semillon the night before at the Frisky Oyster and we LOVE the \"Wild Boar Doe\" (I mean come on- how cute). Andy was also big fan of the 2005 Nine Barrel Reserve Merlot and the Cabernet Sauvignon recently reviewed by the Wine Spectator. Next Stop: Greenport. We got a little hungry and decided to head to Greenport for a little shopping and some snacks. We stopped in for some sandwiches and hot soup and chili at the local cafe, picked up some more bottles of wine for relaxing at the Inn, did a little bit of shopping and then it was already time to spend some lounging time together and to get ready for dinner. Back at the Inn, we tried some local cheeses and stuffed olives with some wines while playing Taboo. Janeczkos vs. Freedmans, Ladies vs. Men, and it got pretty competitive. Jacquie opened up all of her birthday presents while we had some more great wine and then got ready for the dinner we had all been waiting for. The two dinners I have had at the North Fork Table & Innreally are up there with some of the best meals I have had in my life. I am amazed by what incredible and inventive things they are doing out there- and they focus on local, fresh, seasonal ingredients. I started with the pasta- a housemade ricotta cavatelli & porcini mushrooms with parmigiano reggiano, wild arugula, crosnes, and sage. For my entree, I had the Meyers naturally-raised grass-fed N.Y. strip steak medium rare with local yukon gold potato puree, swiss chard, baby carrots, and red wine-horseradish jus. Just typing it now makes my mouth water. I am not normally a dessert fan (opting for an after dinner drink or cheese plate instead), but we went all out on the desserts at this festive feast, and I do have to say that the coffee-toffee ice cream sandwich with roasted bananas and salty peanuts was heavenly. There was also a spicy pumpkin cheesecake that blew my mind. The service could not have been better with all of our meals presented in unison by a well-trained staff. Our waiter was from Morocco and guided us to an amazing Moroccan red wine that I would have never though of ordering on my own. By the time the last bite of warm sugar & spice doughnut was snatched up, we were the last people in the restaurant. Thank goodness we were at our home away from home, because I don't think we could have all squeezed back in our coats after such an indulgent meal. Here are some pics from our phenomenal meal at the Inn. Day 3, Sunday: After so much food and wine, how could I even think of breakfast? The steaming hot biscuits topped with a scramble of egg, cheddar cheese, onion and herbs changed my mind. We popped open a bottle of bubbly to make some mimosas and to toast our fabulous weekend away. After we packed up and checked out there were still a couple stops to make... Stop 1: Vineyard 48 in Cutchogue, New York. Gary had a friend whose brother made wine at Vineyard 48, so we decided to stop by as soon as it opened for our first tasting of the day. We enjoyed the sauvignon blanc and took home a bottle, but Charles and Gary were more interested in the collection of Chess sets and challenged each other to a game while Andy, Jacquie, and I tasted. Stop 2: Peconic Bay Winery in Cutchogue, New York. Peconic Bay was our last winery stop of the weekend and it was the perfect choice. We wanted to hit up a couple more wineries, but Donna and Charles had a flight back Atlanta so we had to make it to LaGuardia in time. We were shocked by the renovation of the tasting room, but were so pleasantly surprised to see that our favorite wine tasting guide was still there with his famous pretzels and dipping mustard to go along with the Riesling. The tasting bar was renovated into a long, roomy bar with wine barrel bar stools. It was still cozy and quaint. Boy were we surprised to see Pascal who we had met and spent time with over a year ago when he worked at Shinn. Pascal was a delight and got us caught up on all the changes at Peconic Bay. Everybody LOVED these wines, especially the Riesling and the late harvest Polaris. The 2001 Merlot Oregon Hills Reserve was also a real treat. Peconic now offers three tasting options, a Reserve Tasting, or Flight 1 or 2. We mixed it up a bit, so we could all try each others favorites off the different flights. After our tastings and purchases, Barbara, Jacquie, and Gary parted ways to try to find some local produce and to head back to Westchester and Connecticut. We were headed to find our Christmas Tree, then for a last stop at Love Lane Kitchen before ending up at LaGuardia. After an amazing weekend of the best wine, food, and company we could hope for, it was very sad to say goodbye, but we know we will all be back. We already started to plan our next weekend getaway in the spring and to all our NOFO friends, we say cheers and happy holidays!

How was the service at Love Lane Kitchen? We've always liked the food (loved some) but we've had a lot of bad service there. I usually chalk it up to the newness and seasonal labor pool, but my wife isn't as patient (she's the former server in the family).

We've been hearing about some great happy hour deals around the city. Here are a few that stand out: BoozyNYC points out another to add to the growing list of burger + beer specials. This one's at Stand (E. 12th b/t Univ. Pl & 5th Ave). Get 2 for 1 burgers everyday between 3-5pm. Also, from 5-7pm everyday get a free beer with your burger. We're not talkin' Bud Light or Natty Light either. Stand has a great list of beers on tap, including offerings from Victory, Dogfish Head and Sixpoint. Find the current list here on BeerMenus. Jill loves that they have Victory Golden Monkey on tap (her favorite beer). I've had the burgers, and while they're not quite Molly's, Burger Joint or Corner Bistro, they're pretty darn good. Draft beers are always $5 by the glass and Stand is one of the few places where you can order by the pitcher ($20). Some more happy hour specials, including where to find cheap wing deals and a happy hour for wine lovers from BoozyNYC, after the jump... Been hearing about the 'extended play' happy hour special at LES spot Verlaine (Rivington nr Essex) for quite some time now. Here, the lychee martinis are only $5 between 5 and 10pm 7 days a week. Both SushiSamba NYC locations are offering low-priced $2 to $4 menu items (spicy crunchy tuna roll, japanese chicken wings, chilled oyster sampler, yellowtail ceviche, etc) on Sundays-Thursdays from 4-7pm and then again from 10pm-close in what they call \"reverse happy hour.\" Click here for one of the most comprehensive list of chicken wing specials around.

Making Sense of the Houston's-Hillstone Debacle: Did it Have to Come to This?
***AUTHOR
Andy
***DATE
2008-12-18 16:28:00
***CONTENT
By now you may have heard that Houston's, with NYC locations on Park Avenue South and East 53rd Street, is changing its name to Hillstone Manhattan, and with that, also changing its concept to a more seasonal focus. I found out about it yesterday from this post on Eater. This has left a lot of people scratchin' their heads. Seems like the gut reaction so far is \"What the Hell Are They Thinking?\" The Houston's name has an incredibly strong brand identity and Houston's is widely heralded as an upscale chain with great, consistent food and quality service. I for one grew up going to Houston's in Atlanta with my parents on a fairly regular basis and the location at 53rd and 3rd is a go-to spot for Jill and I - everything is consistently spot-on good from the hickory burger and the famed spinach and artichoke dip, to the fall-off-the bone ribs, grilled chicken salad, french dip au jus and chicken fingers (an off-the-menu secret item). We also love the affordable wine list that includes several local selections from the North Fork and Finger Lakes. To us, it's the ideal 'non-chainy' chain restaurant. So, what's really goin' on here? An astute Eater commenter, Industry Folk, posted: \"My theory is that the re-branding MUST take place or else Houston's will have to post calorie counts on all their menu items, as mandated by the New York DOH on all restaurant chains.\" My interest was piqued. Could it really be that a huge restaurant group with over 50 restaurants nationwide was going through a massive (and undoubtedly expensive) re-branding just to avoid having to post calories on all menu items in accordance with Section 81.50 of the New York City Health Code? According to another Eater commenter, DjR, \"I was told by a former manager that the reason they changed names was so that they didn't have to post calorie counts.\" Is it really worth risking all the goodwill and brand cachet Houston's had built up over the decades? I decided to poke my head under the covers a bit and see what I could dig up. Find a legal analysis of Section 81.50 of the NYC Health Code, whether Houston's, I mean Hillstone, no I mean Houston's, received good legal and marketing advice, and see if Hillstone is just maybe stealing its name and concept from Blue Hill at Stone Barns, one of our favorite all-time places after the jump... Most everyone is aware of the legal battles that ensued over whether New York City could force restaurant chains to list calorie count on menus. In April of this year a federal judge ruled that New York City could indeed force restaurant chains (with 15 or more outlets across the country) to post calories on their menus since such regulation is not preempted by federal law. I thought the purpose of this new “calorie-count” regulation was to protect against obesity by forcing fast-food chains to post calories for people that otherwise didn’t realize a Double Whopper with cheese is fattening. Was it intended for this legislation to also apply to upscale chain restaurants in NYC like Houston’s? To get to the bottom of this, I decided to put my legal cap on. I dug up the NYC Dept of Health’s Notice of Adoption of Section 81.50 and the language of the regulation. I also found a Calorie-Posting Compliance Guide for Restaurant Operators on the New York City Department of Health & Mental Hygiene website. The background section of 81.50 discusses obesity as an epidemic and as a serious and increasing cause of disease (includes an interesting chart on how obesity prevalence in NYC increased by more than 70% between 1994 and 2004). Hmm, here I always thought New Yorkers were fit cause we walk around so damn much. The background goes on to provide some helpful insights about things you may not know, like “weight gain occurs when more calories are consumed than are expended.” Next it goes on to describe how Americans are eating out more now and that diners eat larger portions out than they do at home. Then it discusses how fast-food chains serve food that is associated with excess calorie consumption and weight gain and that about 90% of restaurant chains in New York City serve fast-food. They also provide data to show that people who eat at fast-food establishments consume more calories. While the background section briefly discusses casual dining chains, the vast majority of it focuses on fast-food chains specifically...and nowhere does it mention anything about a connection between upscale food chains and obesity. The regulation further states the measure is narrowly tailored. Not so sure about that. If it’s so narrowly tailored, then why is this happening to Houston’s and who may be next? Here’s the language that matters — the specific language of the regulation, and in particular, the definition of “Covered Food Service Establishment.” Covered food service establishment shall mean a food service establishment within the City of NewYork that is one of a group of 15 or more food service establishments doing business nationally, offering for sale substantially the same menu items, in servings that are standardized for portion size and content, that operate under common ownership or control, or as franchised outlets of a parent business, or do business under the same name. First off, I think it’s BS for a local NYC health regulation to have criteria that is based upon the # of chains nationally. It should be based on how many locations are here in NYC. Perhaps, this could have more ‘narrowly tailored’ the minimum requirement. Upscale chains like Houston’s would not have found themselves caught up in this calorie-count mess under such a definition. The use of a broad catch-all definition means this applies to many more, perhaps unintended, restaurant chains. So, it appears Houston’s legal looked at this definition and then advised as to certain changes that, if made, would help Houston’s evade the overbroad definition. Here’s what they did: The most important criteria for the definition is the following: \"a group of 15 or more food service establishments doing business nationally, offering for sale substantially the same menu items, in servings that are standardized for portion size and content.\" They apparently advised Houston’s to change the concept. Hence, on the Hillstone website, it reads “Hillstone in New York City — two restaurants with an elevated, made from scratch cuisine featuring the American classics our guests have come to expect and love.” There has been talk about introduction of a new, seasonal menu, but looking at the menu on Hillside’s website, everything looks the same (at least for now). Will be difficult for Hillside to evade this requirement if they continue to feature the American classics people like me have grown to love at Houston's. Sounds like substantially the same menu items to me. If they can get around this criteria about the same menu items, however, then the other criteria would not come into play (i.e., the same name or common ownership/control) and the restaurant would not be deemed a ‘Covered Food Service Establishment.’ It's clear that just changing the name alone won't cut it if Houston's and Hillstone remain under common control or ownership and serve the same menu items. Here’s a criteria of the definition that will be an issue for Houston’s if they are ever challenged as being in violation of this regulation and its found that Hillstone offers \"substantially the same menu items\" as Houston's restaurants around the nation: “a group of 15 or more food service establishments doing business nationally…that operate under common ownership or control, or as franchised outlets of a parent business, or do business under the same name.” They were apparently advised the obvious, change the name. Now, there are only 2 Hillstone Manhattan’s. However, the overbroad definition uses ‘or’s’, not ‘and’s’ so they still have to worry about operating under the same ownership. Not sure how they would demonstrate this one. Clearly, by looking at the website, Houston's, Hillstone and the other restaurants in the Houston's restaurant group are operating under common ownership or control. Even if they set up a separate entity for the Hillstone restaurants, they would be hard-pressed to show that they are not under the same ‘control’ as the other restaurants in the Houston’s restaurant group. What’s funny (and sad) is that they didn’t really have to change the name to avoid being a ‘covered’ restaurant under the regulation…so long as they change the menu items at Hillstone so they are not substantially the same as at Houston's...but then it's not really Houston's, right? So it appears that the only reason they changed the name was so as to avoid confusion among customers who dine at Houston’s restaurants across the nation only to find different menu concepts and items at different places, i.e. more about brand identity and marketing than legal. Bottom line: I’ll be upset if Houston’s/Hillstone in Manhattan replaces the staples from its menu that I’ve grown to love. Based on my read of the regulation, if they don’t substantially change the menu items then they will be potentially vulnerable to being in violation of this regulation. On a different note, another astute Eater commenter, Seyo, wrote: “[Hillstone] Sounds like a ripoff of Blue Hill at the Stone Barns.” Can’t say I disagree, either. I commented back that: “Industry folk is dead on…great call. that’s exactly it. can you imagine how many calories are in that spinach and artichoke dip. Seyo is dead-on, too. Total rip of Blue Hill at Stone Barns…they even put a pic of a cow on the Hillstone web site that looks eerily similar to Blue Hill Stone Barn’s cow logo. Unreal. I love Houston’s. Better not take away the hickory burger, french dip or ribs…i don’t give a damn what season it is.” We’ll have to stay tuned to see how this situation unfolds.

OK, so here's the scoop from an employee. Our owner and founder, George Biel, started his concept with his first Houston's restaurant in Tennessee over 30 years ago, and has since spread to bustling areas around the country. Houston's is not his only restaurant. Others include Bandera Grill, Cherry Creek Grill, Rutherford Grill, Cafe R&D, and others. Please visit http://www.hillstone.com to see all our locations and menus. While our family of restaurants operate under the same code of ethics with regards to service and food preparation (utilizing local purveyors, offering great value for freshly in-house made food, choosing small-production wines for sale at far below industry standard mark-ups, etc), the reason for the different names is to reflect our collective family of restaurants. Hillstone is not something coined to mirror another company or brand. Rather, it is the name of George's vineyard, and at the Lexington and 53rd location, we offer Hillstone wine among our by-the-bottle choices.

First Taste: Craftbar ATL

Hungry for dinner and without reservations, the wife and I couldn't bring ourselves to drive past CRAFT opening weekend here in ATL. We were hoping to squeeze in for a first taste at CRAFTBAR—the looser downstairs sister boasting a recession special menu with entrees under 25 bucks. Although the upstairs was packed, within minutes of our 9PM arrival, we were seated by the small but insanely organized open kitchen. Front and center is owner/chef Tom Colicchio's concept wood-burning stove. It's one of those mother-of-all kitchen creations that most cooks can only dream about, waking up hungry. Once seated, we quickly opened the small menu of wintry interpretations and ATL firsts. The signature drink section on the first page drew us in like thirsty camels and we ordered both a Lions Head and a Sunshine Squeeze. They tasted true to their names: the Lions Head, a sophisticated whiskey/bitters martini; the Sunshine Squeeze, a happy kettle one mixer with lemon and muddled ginger. See if the food lives up to our high expectations after the jump... For the first course, we split the steak tartar and a baby romaine caesar with white anchovies. The tartar was a rustic ode; the raw meat diced into micro cubes, served in a small cast iron trough. The plate was completed with homemade waffle potato chips, a trinity of pickled veggies, and a dollop of whole-grain mustard. I thought that this tartar was excellent, and an interesting new take on the classic. It was not a “wet” tartar as you would expect; the dish was dictated by the unique dicing of the meat and fat. The small cubes fit perfectly into the spaces in the waffle chip-amazing. The salad was delicious. Baby hearts of romaine bathed in a caesar emulsification. We cut it with our butter knife. The fresh white anchovies added the perfect, naturally salted touch to finish the dish. For our main courses, I ordered the Lamb Tenderloin with a fresh mint yogurt, chickpeas, and spinach. The dish was a true Mediterranean classic, probably prepared the same way hundreds of years ago over a similar wood-fire grill. The chick peas, fresh olive oil, yogurt and mint all mixed together for a blissful last bite. Wife ordered the famous Veal Ricotta Meatballs with homemade tagliatelle. Colicchio channels the spirit of an Italian octogenarian in this hearty, hand-made dish. The meatballs are perfect in every fashion; soft and delicate in form, bold and hearty in taste. On both meals, the presentation was classic. The proportions were a bit on the light side, my wife and I cleaning our plates. But we had dessert to attend to. For our final course, I stepped it up and asked our waiter if we could re-locate to the big sofa table in the back that was moments before relinquished. The waiter was more than willing to oblige, confirming its “best table” status. In such a relaxed position, it was too easy to order both the home-made smores and the ginger-beer cream-sickle float. The smores were divine: perfectly melted California chocolate coated a warm, homemade, vanilla-bean marshmallow, sandwiched between two freshly baked graham crackers. Summer camp has nothing on this; think sandwich of the gods. The wife and I coined this the, “Death Penalty Dessert,” as we concluded that if you disliked this dessert, you should have your gene pool phased out. We knew that we had picked the perfect drink to wash everything down as soon as we fished our straws out of the cold fountain glass. The cream-sickle float had chunks of gingerbread and oranges throughout. Subsequently, it was gone in 60 seconds with the help of the long spoons provided. The perfect ending to another great meal. As far as our first taste goes, we had no doubts that CRAFT/CRAFTBAR would live up to its high expectations. With his warm, rustic flair, Colicchio’s New York concept feels right at home. After all, this isn’t the first time Atlanta has seen the power of a northerner who likes to play with fire. We will be back.

Thanks to a comment from byob lover to our Kuma Inn BYO review, we learned about BYOBLocator (http://www.byoblocator.com). This will be an amazing online resource for BYOB lovers everywhere when it takes off. BYOBLocator is in its infancy and really needs people like us to log on and spread the word about BYOB spots in their locale. The site creators designed an engine so that anyone can add a BYOB that others can then search for. It's completely free, but how valuable it ultimately becomes depends on input from users and restaurant owners. BYOB owners can enter information about their BYOB and update it regularly. BYOB Locator will be adding more features soon such as ability for BYOB owners to add and update their menus. Right now there are no results when you type in NYC area zip codes. Let's see if we can change that. In addition to these, I'm adding the following to BYOBLocator as we speak: BYO is back at Persimmon Kimchi House (1st Ave. & 10th) Sigiri Sri Lanka Restaurant (1st Ave b/t 5th & 6th) Free corkage Monday nights at Tribeca Grill (Greenwich and Franklin)

Just saw that Astor Wines & Spirits (Lafayette @ E. 4th) is offering some INSANE deals on some of its best-selling wines of 2008. We're talkin' Two-Buck Chuck prices folks. A tempranillo for $4.99! An Argentinian red for $3.99! A prosecco for $4.99! The best part is that you can sample them all at a free tasting tonight at Astor between 6-8pm and decide which ones to buy. These would make for terrific holiday gifts and stocking stuffers. The Top 5 Under $5 Pack includes five of their best-selling wines and an Astor tote bag for just $23.95. One friggin' martini in Paris cost me more than that.

It seems like there has been some reverse migration going on. While some well-known, old-time Atlanta chefs and restaurateurs have recently up and left the ATL for NYC (first it was Joel Antunes of Joël heading to NYC for a position at the Oak Room at the newly refurbished Plaza Hotel -- check out today's NYPost review here - and then it was world-class sushi chef Sotohiro Kosugi dealing the ATL a blow by announcing his plans to close his popular Atlanta Japanese restaurant, Soto, to open one in New York), some big-name NYC chefs are breaking on to the ATL dining scene in a major way. Celeb chefs Tom Colicchio, Laurent Tourondel and Jean-Georges Vongerichten are blanketing the ATL with new locations of their famous food franchises, making the ATL the next big culinary destination in the eyes of many. Tom Colicchio opened Craft Atlanta and Craftbar in front of The Mansion on Peachtree. “We’re excited to come to Atlanta, a city with great food culture,” Colicchio says. “The wealth of local farms and artisanal producers here make it an ideal home for Craft.” Chef Kevin Maxey of Craft Dallas is in charge of the kitchen. BLT Steak opens in Allen Plaza’s new W Atlanta Downtown next month. “Atlanta is a great city with an emerging culinary scene, and I am excited to have BLT Steak be a part of the development of this city as a new food destination,” Laurent Tourondel says. “I love the energy of the city, and I think BLT Steak will match the personalities in Atlanta.” Will be interesting to see how BLT Steak stacks up against some old-school ATL steakhouses like Chops, Bone’s and Kevin Rathbun Steak. Chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten opened a Spice Market outpost in April inside the W Atlanta Midtown. “Atlanta’s evolving dining scene continues to draw my attention to the South,” Vongerichten says. “The city’s culinary diversity makes it an ideal home for a concept like Spice Market.” But he didn't stop there. In November, Vongerichten opened Market, a chic comfort food concept, in the new W Buckhead. Wined & Dined has you covered with some loyal blog readers down in the 404 who will be checking out some of these new celeb chef outposts, as well as other spots in the Dirty South, and reporting back to us. Will these new splashy restaurants bearing celebrity chef names become the next wave of the ATL dining scene or are they merely a temporary trend until a new band of local culinary talent emerges? Is the ATL becoming a dining destination like NYC? ATL didn't seem to take well to Emeril's outpost. Be on the look out for reviews from guest contributors Adam Kramer and Scott Solomon who have their fingers on the pulse of the ATL dining scene. In fact, Adam and wife Elyssa hit up Craftbar ATL this past weekend and Adam's review will be up on the site soon. We're also lookin' forward to hearing about the gastropub craze that is taking over the ATL...oh yeah, and someone's gotta send us some pics of the burgers from Ann's Snack Bar (the WSJ called it the \"Best Hamburger in America.\")

We Had a Pretty Nice (and Comedic) Little Saturday!

***CONTENT
We had a pretty nice (and very spontaneous) little Saturday...first we went to a free wine tasting of Long Island wines at Union Square Wines where we spoke with Kareem Massoud, Paumanok Vineyard's winemaker, and tried Paumanok's 2007 Sauvignon Blanc and Chenin Blanc, as well as its 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon and Late Harvest Sauvignon Blanc (delicious -- we took a bottle of this home with us). We also tried about 10 wines from Channing Daughters Winery and met winemaker Christopher Tracy. Yeah, we bought a few bottles of wine then headed to Blind Tiger Ale House in the West Village for some beers and chili, stuff like that. I had a Bear Republic Racer 5 IPA and a cask Brooklyn IPA, while Jill enjoyed a Lagunitas Maximus and a Stone Arrogant Bastard. We both agreed that the chili was the best we've had in the city. Was also thinking about trying the hot wings, which were recently lauded by NYC Food Guy in a post on NYC's Best Wings. Next, we were off to grab an early bite at The Spotted Pig, but didn't know there would be a 2+ hour wait for a table at 5:30pm. Unbelievable. So, we left there and then stopped in for a drink at Whitehorse Tavern a block away where all the talk was about the spate of recent muggings in the area (even saw a news truck interviewing people about these). More on our fun Saturday, including a comedy show, after the jump... Leaving Whitehorse Tavern, the idea was to head home and order in Indian food and open a bottle of our new wine. Here's where things got a bit spontaneous...on the way back east to our place, the car drove right by Gotham Comedy Club and Jill noticed on the sign that a show was starting in 20 minutes at 7pm. We looked at each other and said 'yeah, lets do it.' We had the driver pull over at the next block and proceeded to purchase 2 seats. The guy told us it was going to be a pretty full show, but that he was putting us at the front and center table. The show was Rob Bartlett’s Christmas Cavalcade. We soon found out why they put us where they did...we were used for about 20 minutes of material and it was hilarious. Everything from how we met at LaGuardia Airport and celebrate Christmakkah to the fact that we're both attorneys and were wearing what he described as slippers to the club. He actually took our shoes off our feet and showed them to the audience. Mine were UGG's and Jill was wearing her Tom's. Everyone came over to us after the show and congratulated us as if we had just performed on stage. Rob called us over afterwards and thanked us for being good sports. We had a blast. Finally, we headed home and ordered in Indian. We were so beat we were barely awake when it arrived. Crazy day.

Thanks to this post on Cellarette, I found out about another top 100 wine list. This one's from Wine.com. The 2008 edition of the Wine.com 100 marks the second year the online wine retailer has compiled a top 100 list based entirely on customer preferences. The ranking reflects the top 1% of wines sold nationally on Wine.com during 2008. While many publications rank wines based on the opinions of wine critics, customers are the judge here by voting with their dollars.The Wine.com 100 list shows customers are choosing both quality and price, with 94 of the wines rated 90 points or higher from leading wine publications and over 70 wines priced under $20. This list is a great resource for discovering some high-quality, recession-proof value wines. What I also like about this list is that most of the bottles are widely available at wine shops across the country. The ones that you should look for after the jump... Most of the great values here are from Chile, Argentina, Australia, Spain and New Zealand. Here are our Top 10 Values from the Wine.com Top 100: #1 out of 100 Veramonte Cabernet Sauvignon Reserva 2006 (Chile) - Cabernet Sauvignon -- $10 #4 out of 100 Cristalino Brut Cava Non-Vintage (Spain) - $8 #7 out of 100 Kim Crawford Sauvignon Blanc 2007 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough, New Zealand) - $15 #11 out of 100 Don Rodolfo Malbec 2005 Malbec (Argentina) - $10 #18 out of 100 A to Z Pinot Noir 2006 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley, Oregon) - $19 #33 out of 100 Nobilo Sauvignon Blanc 2007 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough, New Zealand) - most wines across the country carry this bang-for-your-buck New Zealand white and we've seen it for as little as $8 a bottle. #35 out of 100 Penfolds Koonunga Hill Shiraz-Cabernet 2006 (Australia) - like the Nobilo above, most wine stores across the country carry this great value wine. Our friend Jordan loves it. It's one of the few Australian reds you can get for under $10. #36 out of 100 Avalon Napa Cabernet Sauvignon 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley) - we've had this wine a lot over the past year and it's a great value at $14. #46 out of 100 Santa Rita Carmenere Reserva 2006 Carmenere (Chile) - one of the first wines we fell in love with was a carmenere -- click here to check it out. Haven't tried this one, but at $11 we'll be giving it a go soon. #69 out of 100 Bitch Grenache 2006 Grenache (Barossa Valley, Australia) - don't be fooled by the 'trying to hard to be cutesy' name, Bitch makes some great wines. You should be able to find this Bitch for about $11.

This just in from roving reporter and food fan Scott Solomon down in Atl. Scott and wife Meredith stopped in at Flip (Blais from Top Chef's new burger spot) for dinner last night on just it's second night of service. You will be hearing more from Scott here on Wined&Dined in the future as he wines and dines it up in the Atl (my hometown). We're particularly lookin' forward to hearing whether all the celeb chef outposts opening in the Atl live up to their NYC reputations (talkin' about Craft, Craftbar, Spice Market, BLT Steak, Il Mulino, etc.): \"Blais was very engaging, going around and talking with every customer, and checking up on everyone. He was very interested in getting real feedback. Cool decor, i love those tvs that are framed like mirrors (pic below). Great atmosphere..place was packed, hard to park, good music and vibe. Bar packed too. Liquid nitrogen tanks in the corner. Every few minutes Richard would go over there and concoct milkshakes and drinks with the nitrogen. Meredith (and I) loved the fries.. he said it is a 3 day process of blanching, liquid nitrogen, duck fat, peanut oil etc. Perfectly crispy outside- real Frites!!\" More of Scott's first impressions (and pics) after the jump... Burgers are inventive, he said people average sharing 3 for 2 people. Regular burger good, but not Shake Shack good. Had a vinegary taste, probably from the pickles. Pork belly burger was amazing!! Salty and juicy, it was heaven on a bun. Butcher cut was very good too...demi glaze and bleu cheese. Very rich, you lose the taste of the beef, but i think thats the point- creativity with different burgers, sauces etc.. I think the thing here is trying all the different burgers in different styles. soup of the day was a chili, burger of the day a tuna tartare burger. I saw liquid nitrogen margaritas and milkshakes (nutella, pistachio, crispy creme), but stuck to beer...\" Flip Burgers TV's Look Like Mirrors Frites!

Jean-Georges' Heartfelt Gift of $24 Lunch/$35 Dinner Recession Specials
***AUTHOR
Andy
***DATE

***CONTENT
This could be the ultimate recession special. Just read a post titled ‘My Gift to You This Season’ on Jean-Georges’ personal blog. He writes, “I sincerely believe that great food lifts your spirits, that a beautiful restaurant serves as an escape. I’ve created my restaurants to be places that offer a gracious welcome, that pamper our guests with delicious food and friendly service. And now I want to extend more generosity to my fellow New Yorkers. I’m offering prix-fixe lunch for $24 and prix-fixe dinner for $35 at my restaurants in the city.” More on the JG recession specials after the jump… Jean-Georges calls Matsugen \"the best deal, by far.\" It may just be that Matsugen, which opened in Tribeca in June directly into the economic headwinds of the recession, is hurting a bit. According to the blog, \"In this mini-omakase dinner menu, you get six courses, including the black cod with miso and the Kamoseiro duck soup with soba noodles. It's a deeply satisfying meal that gives you a true taste of Japan. I also love the bento box lunch because one of the four courses is the goma-dare soba, my favorite dish there.\" N.B. -- Nougatine, JoJo and Perry St. only offer the $35 dinner menus before 6:30pm and after 10pm (for Perry St. it's after 9:30pm). Available at Matsugen and Vong all the time. Interesting that the blog post mentions nothing about his NYC flagship restaurant. We'll do some research and let you know what we find out.

Andy and I have been dying to try Kuma Inn for ages. After having to cancel a couple of reservations, we finally made it to Kuma Inn with Donna and Charles in from Atlanta and with our friend Gassan. In harsh economic times, BYOBs are a great choice for those of us who normally have a heftier wine bill than food bill when we go out to eat. We heard great things about Kuma Inn and we were not disappointed. Kuma Inn is located at 113 Ludlow between Delancey and Rivington on the Lower East Side. The first time we attempted to give it a try we could not even find it, because it is hidden up a narrow staircase on the second floor of the building. This time there was a blackboard on the sidewalk with an arrow, so we could not miss it. After having a couple of strong ales at Spitzer's (only 1/2 a block away), one of our favorite beer bars, we were hungry for dinner. We headed up the stairs and were immediately faced with the small open kitchen and the cooler (keeping various bottles of sake, wine, and ingredients cold) in the tiny waiting area. We were seated right away and were ready to start our own tasting of Kuma Inn small plates. More on our Kuma Inn BYO extravaganza after the jump... Kuma Inn descibes its food as \"Southeast Asian-style tapas.\" The chef, King Phojanakong, a \"Thai-Filipino New Yorker\" has cooked for Bouley and Boulud, but there is definitely no foie gras or truffles on this menu! The flavors of the small plates are certainly Asian but are vibrant and inventive. We brought four bottles of wine with us and went through them all (Note- $5 corkage fee per bottle) as we embarked on our tasting adventure ordering at least 3 separate rounds of dishes. We tried so much it is hard to describe each dish, but I've listed our favorites and the ones we wished we skipped below. We truly feasted at Kuma Inn and it was hard not to continue the ordering frenzy after tasting such wonderful dishes, but beware that Kuma Inn is cash only so you may want to stop by an ATM before devouring the scrumptious small plates like this is your last supper- they do add up in the end! Our Favorites: (photos that follow were taken by a much more highly skilled food photog than us, Tina Wong, aka The Wandering Eater) * Deep fried pork belly lechon kawali with atchara (pork belly + fried = mmmmm....) * Yellowfin tuna tartare with a rice noodle crisp (Fresh yellowfin with nice citrus balance- another please) * Sautéed chinese sausage with thai chili-lime sauce (Something a bit different for an Asian plate and the sauce was incredible) * Shrimp Shumai (A special for the day- not like any other shrimp shumai I've ever tasted!) * Pork Buns (Another special for the day- savory pulled pork and plump round buns) * Asian Paella (You MUST try this) * Steamed edamame with thai basil-lime oil (A staple snack with a different twist- loved the oil) Ones we would Skip: * Grilled baby octopus with pickled bamboo shoots (Needed some sauce for the grilled octopus) * Grilled salmon, shitake mushrooms & baby bok choy (Good classic dish, but too much else to try!) * Sautéed tofu, thai basil and wood ears in spicy soy mirin (Also tasty, but other veggie options were more spicy and flavorful)

hey byob lover- thanks for the tip. that site's awesome. we'll do a post about it. in these tough times, byo's are the ultimate way to eat out....especially if you drink as much as jill and i do. our wine/liquor tab is almost always more than our food tab. i hate paying huge mark-ups on wine. the more i'm getting to know my wines, the more i see places that serve a glass for more than it costs for the bottle at a wine shop.

Thanks to our friend Leena for forwarding us a NYT Diner's Journal blog post about La Cave des Fondus, a new spot opening today in Soho at Prince and Elizabeth, that gives whole new meaning to the term 'bottle service.' Suck on this -- wine and beer will be served to customers baby boomers in baby bottles. Guess they were out of sippy cups. Apparently, this bizarre concept is modeled after a Paris restaurant Le Refuge des Fondus. If like us you're having trouble imagining people 'whining and dining' with baby bottles, click here to watch it in action. Oh yeah, they'll also be serving different types of fondue...but you have to eat it out of a crazy straw.

Top Chef's Richard Blais Opens Flip Burger Boutique in Atlanta (Is NYC Next?)

While NYC food bloggers are hyping City Burger's new so-called Pat La Frieda Black Label burger mix, word has it from our friend Adam Kramer that Season 4 Top Chef finalist and gastro-guru Richard Blais (our favorite contestant) has opened Flip Burger Boutique down in the Atl. Flip's website is up n' runnin'. Hints that Flip may be comin' to NYC and some early pics after the jump... According to the press release, Blais is Flip's creative director. “The menu I developed for Flip was a challenge I was up for,” says Blais. “It was fun to take something so common, like the burger, and give it a modern twist.” Some feature items include organic beef with homemade ketchup and mayonnaise; a po “boyger” with grilled shrimp, fried lemon and spicy tartar sauce; a lamb burger with green olive relish and raisin ketchup on a rosemary bun; and an authentic Kobe burger, utilizing fresh beef imported from Japan, dressed with herbal butter, red onion marmalade and blue cheese. Flip will grind their signature beef burger using short ribs, hanger steak and brisket. Balancing out the menu, a variety of vegetable burgers will also be available, creating a selection suitable for all taste palates. The burgers will be smaller than the traditional burger to encourage diners to indulge in more than one. The edgy, unconventional decor includes communal seating, reflecting ceiling elements, a chefs table and a classic diner feel. We're guessin' Atlanta will be flippin' for a while over this place. Some early reviews are already in from friends and family pre-opening dinners. Here is a great photo slide show and what The Blissful Glutton has to report after a recent visit. Apparently Blais will continue to practice his molecular gastronomy at Flip's liquid-nitrogen milk-shake bar. Jill and I got a chance to try his 'popcornsicles' made with liquid nitrogen this summer at Garrett Popcorn here in NYC. Blais has been hinting that a Manhattan outpost may be in the offing. As Blais, a New York native, told TimeOut NY about Flip in July: \"[New York] is the next market we're looking to hit.\" Here are some teasers from Flip's menu (full menu here) BEEF BURGERS CORNED BEEF + CABBBAGE + POACHED EGG 7 SMOKED BEEF + COLE SLAW + RBQ SAUCE 7 PHILLY + CHEESE WHIZ FOAM + GREEN PEPPERS 7 BEEF TARTARE + CAPERS + AIOLI + CORNICHONS 11 BUTCHER + CARAMELIZED ONION + BLUE CHEESE + RED WINE JAM 8 COUNTRY FRIED + PIMENTO CHEESE + PICKLED OKRA 7 DELUXE + FOIE GRAS + WAGYU BEEF + SHAVED TRUFFLE 24 OTHER BURGERS TURKEY + MUSHROOM + POBLANO + AVOCADO PEPPER JACK 6 FAUX BURGER + FARM HOUSE CHEESE + SWEET SOY KETCHUP 7 FLIP SIDES 4 SWEET POTATO TOTS FRENCH FRIES TEMPURA RUTABAGA VODKA BATTERED ONION RINGS Finish it all with an aptly southern Krispy Kreme or sweet tea milkshake. Can't wait to hear how it is from our Atlanta friends and family. Send us pics!

It's yummy! Went the other day with friends and had the Butcher burger, tater-tot sweet potatoes; sampled the fries, vodka battered onion rings and sampled someone's Nutella chocolate milkshake-very good. Had their house margarita which did not really impress. Only annoyance was the long 45 minute wait to get in-they don't take reservations and they seem to remember you by the clothing you're wearing...they were looking for my sister-in-law's v neck sweater and almost grabbed another customer by mistake-surely there's a better way! Can't wait to go back again though...

Last night was the celebration of my daughter's birthday. We had 12 people in our party. I arrived at 5:20 p.m. and the restaurant was almost filled to compacity. Other than waiting almost an hour and playing musical tables trying to fit everyone together. All of the wait staff, manager and hostess where most accommodating. The burgers were incredible, (all my guests enjoyed the ones they ordered) the food come out \"hot\" and the milkshakes were from heaven!!

went 3 nights ago on a date around 6 and luckily we arrived just before the rest of midtown came flooding in. We still had to wait 30 minutes even though it was clear that there were empty seats & tables just waiting to be sat in. Servers/waiters seemed to be in a bit of a slow mode, but could be b/c kitchen just wasn't serving slider-sized burgers quick enough. I loved the ambience of the restaurant, but burgers were just a bit on the small sized for the price. Pretty decent though. The vodka battered onion rings were the best. -note, a couple that walked in less than 5 minutes after we did were still standing around when we paid and left. I think traffic flow will be better once it's warm enough to open the outside seating.

Hi there, I work in public relations for The Empire Hotel. Just want to let everyone know, that the event is not at The Empire Hotel Rooftop, but instead at The Lobby Bar. They're two different venues. You can literally do a bar crawl within the hotel. There is The Lobby Bar, Center Cut, The Rooftop and The Pooldeck. It's a very cool place that caters to everyone. Thanks! Rachel

NY Post's Page 6 Magazine Calls North Fork \"The New Napa Valley\"

For some time now we have been telling our friends and family about our affection for NY's North Fork wine region. Jill's Uncle Bob called us up yesterday to tell us about a story on the North Fork that we have to check out in Sunday's NY Post Page 6 magazine. We're actually taking our family to the North Fork this weekend, so we were pretty psyched to read about how the North Fork is becoming the \"hottest weekend winery destination\" and that \"experts say now is the perfect time to visit, even though it's chilly.\" There's even a section of the story titled \"A Winter Wine Weekend: How to eat, drink, shop and relax over two days in Long Island wine country.\" Impeccable timing. All we had to do was show this story to our parents and they would know exactly what we have in store for them this weekend. The \"where to stay\" and \"where to eat and drink\" is almost the weekend we planned to a \"t\". More on our weekend itinerary after the jump We're staying at (I should say 'taking over') The North Fork Table & Inn run by the husband-wife team of Claudia Fleming (former Gramercy Tavern pastry chef) and Gerry Hayden and eating at their amazing restaurant Saturday night. Friday night we'll be dining at The Frisky Oyster in Greenport, where Eileen Duffy, the sommelier and author of the wine blog Cellarette, picks and chooses among the best local wines to comprise her wine list. We'll also be hitting up some of our favorite North Fork wineries, like Bedell and Shinn Estate, as well as a few recommended by Lenn Thompson, publisher of Lenndevours wine blog, who has become our go-to resource for information on the North Fork and Finger Lakes wine regions. Lenn is doing great things in terms of promoting and educating people about New York wine.

It is our family tradition to gather in NYC to celebrate Thanksgiving every year. That means we can toast to all that we are thankful for with some fabulous wines and appetizers in our Manhattan apartment, but cooking up a full fledged Thanksgiving feast is a bit difficult with limited oven and fridge space. So, it has become our tradition to head out for a great prix fixe Thanksgiving dinner after gathering at our place first for some homemade starters and some of our favorite local wines. Memories of Thanksgiving always put a smile on my face. The Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade on the television followed by my favorite - the National Dog Show, the smells of simmering onions, carrots, and celery filling the house, the taste of a crisp, dry New York State Riesling in hand, the loud laughs and booming conversation of family, and the anticipation of an endless amount of delicious comfort food coming my way. Does it get any better than this? This year couldn't have been more perfect. Read more about how we celebrated one of our favorite holidays after the jump... We started our day with breakfast at home- Andy an indulgent everything bagel with smoked salmon, capers, tomato, and onion from Ess-a-Bagel (and a beer) and me with my bowl of Special K (I needed to keep it light in order to gear up for some serious holiday eating). I enjoyed watching the little pups prance around the Philadelphia stage in the National Dog Show as I started putting together some appetizers. I made a homemade bruschetta on a toasted french baguette with creamy goat cheese. I mixed the freshly chopped tomatoes, garlic, basil, and lemon juice the night before so all the flavors could really blend by the time it was plated. I also made a basil, lemon, chive, olive oil, and almond puree to drizzle on some whipped ricotta on top of bagel chips and topped with rolled up slices of prosciutto. Lastly, I roasted some mushrooms and filled them with a French goat cheese and topped them with some bread crumbs that I toasted in a homemade rosemary infused olive oil. I also put together an array of toasted pita chips, Italian olive oil crackers, raw almonds, dried cranberries, roasted red pepper hummus, and classic Babaganoush. After the tables were filled with food and all the wine and cocktail mixes were arranged, it was time to relax with a 2007 Hunt Country Semi-Dry Riesling that we had picked up on our trip to the Finger Lakes. Andy's parents arrived from Atlanta and my Mom came over with my sister Jacquie and Gary. Andy's sister Stacey, and her husband Jonathan and little girl Zoe also joined us at our apartment. We popped open a magnum of Hermann J. Wiemer's 2007 Dry Riesling and a bottle of 2007 Molly Dooker Two Left Feet and 2007 Molly Dooker The Boxer. We enjoyed catching up and hearing about all of our 2008 adventures in Capri, Rome, Istanbul, Paris, Bordeaux, Turks & Caicos, Hawaii, and California. After a couple of hours of great conversation and a couple more bottles of wine, we were off to the restaurant. Every year we pick a B.R. Guest restaurant for Thanksgiving dinner. This was the second year in a row that we chose Primehouse and before that we had been to Fiamma, Blue Water Grill, and Blue Fin. Although one would not normally think of a steakhouse as a Thanksgiving restaurant destination, Primehouse was a perfect choice for its classic $42 prix fixe Thanksgiving menu. There are some great new American market-driven restaurants that have amazing Thanksgiving prix fixe menus, but at double the price (at least) of the B.R Guest restaurants. With consistent, reliable, tasty and very reasonably priced Thanksgiving meals at any of the B.R Guest restaurants open on Thanksgiving, it's an easy choice. I had the Butternut squash soup with porcini, brown butter, and creme fraiche, followed by the oven roasted turkey breast and leg confit with spiced sweet potato, fall vegetables, mashed potato, natural gravy, stuffing, and cranberry sauce (with a side skillet of extra dark meat- the very tastiest part of the turkey). For dessert, I had an apple crumb bar with autumn fruit compote and cranberry swirl ice cream. We also had a couple bottles of New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc and an Australian Grenache. After all the pre-dinner appetizers and wine, I could not finish any of my dinner plates, but everything was excellent. Once we all made it back to the apartment, we finished the night with a North Fork 2005 Corey Creek Late Harvest Riesling with more toasts and great stories. Another lively, fun, and indulgent NYC Thanksgiving- Wined & Dined style! Thank you to Charles and Donna for treating us to such an amazing holiday meal!

With Thanksgiving right around the corner, we should all take a moment to think about everything that we have to be thankful for and to think about those who may be going through very difficult times, whether health-related, job-related, etc. Thanksgiving is all about putting things in proper perspective. We wish all of our friends and family a safe, happy and healthy Thanksgiving holiday. Enjoying a bottle (or four) of wine over good conversation with our family over the holidays is just one of the many things Jill and I are especially thankful for. If you can, try to drink local wines and support your local winemakers this holiday season. In these difficult and trying economic times, it's important for us to support our nation's economy, and that includes our nation's winemakers. We'll be opening some of our favorite bottles of wine we have picked up on our trips to the North Fork and Finger Lakes. Here are what some writers around the country are recommending as some great value holiday wines to be thankful for: Thanksgiving Wine Recommendations Under $20 [AmericanWinery.com] Keep Your Thanksgiving Wine Choices Fresh (25 under $20 versatile and inexpensive red wine selections) [Seattle Times] Ten Wines for the Thanksgiving Table (Gary Vaynerchuk selects 10 under $21 wines) [Forbes] Thanksgiving Wines Under $20 that Stand Up to Smoked Turkey [Dallas Morning News] The Annual Puzzle of What to Pour [Washington Post] Best Value Wine Picks for Thanksgiving [Spirit of Wine] Thanksgiving Wine Under $20: 2008 Picks [Good Wine Under $20 Blog] ...and a couple of writers who have had enough with all the Thanksgiving wine recommendations: Stop the Thanksgiving Wine Recommendations!

Brunch Spot: Is Prune Really Worth the Wait?
***AUTHOR

***CONTENT
We were really excited to try Prune - especially after hearing it is a favorite among chefs/restaurateurs (Bourdain and Ripert swear by it) and seeing the crowds that form outside on any given Saturday and Sunday for brunch. Critics have been heaping praise upon chef Gabrielle Hamilton (Prune apparently was her childhood nickname) for years now. This past Sunday in particular was a frigid, windy Fall day, but that didn't stop us and our friends Amber and Andy from huddling with the masses to wait for a table. For those who haven't been, Prune is a pint-size restaurant in the E. Village that is quite charming in that old French country kind of way, with worn walls, antique mirrors, and open French doors. To say the place is tightly packed is an understatement. Tables are close together, just barely letting a person fit in between each table and inundating diners with lively chatter from neighboring tables. What we thought after the jump... We got to Prune right around 2:30 and we were seated by 3:00. Much better than we expected. One of the reasons the line appears so long outside is that there's no waiting by the bar. Typically, we would chill inside with a drink and wait for a table to open. Those seated just before us had been waiting closer to an hour and a half and we hear that a two hour wait time is not unusual. We actually got lucky and were able to skip a four-top ahead of us because they did not want to sit in the semi-private nook downstairs...are you kidding me? That's the only spacious spot in the house. We were already off to a good start. Things were about to get better. The server came over to take our drink order and I was about to order my typical extra spicy bloody mary before realizing there was a full bloody mary menu (see below for the bloody choices). I went with the Southwest (Herradura Anejo tequila, smoked chipotle, peppers, limes), Jill opted for the Chicago Matchbox (homemade lemon vodka, pickled brussels sprouts, baby white turnips, caperberries, green beans, and radishes), Amber chose the Classic (Absolut vodka, celery and lemon) and Andy #2 ordered the Green Lake (Absolut vodka, wasabi and a beef jerky swizzle). I think the Green Lake won with the wasabi and beef jerky swizzle, but Jill's was great, too. Best part is that every bloody comes with a side shot of beer. Great idea. For our meals, Andy and I ordered the huevos rancheros (though I was dying to try the burger, but it's not on the brunch menu), Amber got the Spaghetti a la Carbonara (mixed w/ egg, bacon, and pepper) and Jill the spicy stewed chickpeas nestle on eggs coated in buttered bread crumbs. I was struck by how small my huevos was, but it was pretty solid...nothing insane though. I thought Jill's was delicious...mediterranean flavors blended nicely in the spicy stewed chickpeas with coddled, butter-crumble-crusted eggs sitting amid the stew. Definitely something you can't get at any old diner. Jill and I also got a side of the lamb sausage, served pinwheel style and secured with a toothpick...a little pricey at $5 but pretty darn good. I think Amber's breakfast spaghetti took it though. I love going out to eat with Amber cause she always lets me clear her plate...and this was one plate I enjoyed clearing. The carbonara sauce was nice, not too greasy or eggy, and the bacon bits were crispy and very flavorful. Only thing is I couldn't really tell there was an egg component to the dish. Oh well, it was really good so it didn't bother me too much. THE VERDICT To me, for a brunch place to be worth the wait and the higher cost (slightly overpriced + no free brunch cocktail = higher cost), the dishes have to be something different and amazing... definitely has to be more special than you would get from any old place on your corner. Like, for example, Norma's 'super cheesy' french toast with applewood bacon is something different and special. At Prune, the bloody mary's are the main draw. Unfortunately, they come with a price tag. For one bloody mary and one dish, we each paid $28. With all of the wonderful brunch places in the E. Village that offer up at least one free cocktail, Prune's not worth it to me. I'll take the chicken fried steak w/ eggs + 3 drinks for $16 at Essex over my $28 Prune brunch any day. We will be back to try dinner, though. Have heard great things about the roasted marrow bones. I also don't get all the rules, which I find strange for a place that seems so chill and easy-going...no cell phones, no substitutions, no free coffee refills, etc. Didn't happen to us, but I've heard people complain about being pushed to pay and leave. Makes sense though with a place that small. ---BLOODY MARY MENU--- served w/ a shot of light beer as a chaser// $9 Classic (Absolut vodka, celery and lemon) Danish (Aquavit, fresh fennel and a whole marinated white anchovy) Bullshot (Absolut vodka, beef bouillon, Worcestershire, Tabasco) (Bloody Bull Bullshot w/ Bloody Mix) Mariner (Absolut citron vodka, clam juice and obires) Southwest (Herradura Anejo tequila, smoked chipotle, peppers, limes) Caesar (Boodles British gin, clam juice, and a pickled egg) Maria (classic w/ sangria tequila) Deadly (classic w/ Absolut vodka and a splash of sangria tequila) *Green Lake (Absolut vodka, wasabi and a beef jerky swizzle) *Chicago Matchbox (homemade lemon vodka, pickled brussels sprouts, baby white turnips, caperberries, green beans, and radishes)

BYO restaurants are the best way to dull the pain of the price of dining in NYC and represent some of the city's hidden gems. The problem is not too many restaurants are willing to forgo an alcohol revenue stream with its huge mark-ups. One thing we've noticed is that restaurants will open before receiving their liquor license and operate on a temporary BYO basis. Remember this is how it was at Mercadito for a while. We received an email newsletter on Tuesday from Tasting Table alerting us to Motorino, a new restaurant in Brooklyn that's BYO for a limited time. We're gonna check it out Sat night and let you know how it goes.

NYC & Company today announced the launch of the third phase of the Just Ask The Locals campaign that includes city dining tips from local chefs and celebs. Though the chefs and restaurateurs are quick to plug some of their own establishments, it's interesting to see some of the other places around the five boroughs they frequent and some of their favorite foods around the city...here's a taste: Eric Ripert - digs the wood-buring oven at Peasant, eats late night at Balthazar, L'Absinthe and Yakitori Totto, romances at Chanterelle, Danube and Annisa and calls Peter Luger legendary. Mario Batali -- Katz's pastrami sandwich, Morandi, Centro Vinoteca, Gottino, Spotted Pig and for a recession special he goes to Mamoun's Falafel (though I doubt he goes there cause his wallet's tight). His off the beaten path spots include Mario's in the Bronx and Ferdinando's Focacceria in Brooklyn for the spleen sandwich and panelles. Padma, Colicchio and others after the jump... Colicchio - Spotted Pig, Hearth (to see Marco Canora cooking), Terroir Wine Bar, Allen & Delancey for a romantic meal, celebrations at Masa, Gramercy Tavern, Jean Georges and Le Bernardin and the wine lists at Babbo, Per Se and Daniel (apparently someone's not hurtin' in these tough economic times) Padma Lakshmi - Shake Shack, Indochine, Peasant, Veritas, La Esquina, Daniel and a hidden gem in the E. Village -- Il Posto Accanto (next door to and same owner as Il Bagatto) Danny Meyer - his must-go places for visitors include Barbuto, Peter Luger and Prune, 2nd Ave Deli for lunch, late night eating at Spotted Pig, Yakitori Totto, Degustation, Arturo's and 'ino, and burgers at his own Blue Smoke, DB Bistro and JG Melon, and finally sushi at Gari, Sushi Ann and Sushi Yasuda. Marcus Samuelsson -- Burgers at Shake Shack and Pop Burger (really?), must-go places include Aquavit (shameless plug), Jean Georges, Republic (really?), WD-50 and Peter Luger, late night eats at Brasserie, Blue Ribbon Sushi, Florent (someone should tell him it closed), Spotted Pig and anywhere in C-town, recession specials at Dumpling House, AQ Cafe (another shameless plug), Katz's Deli, Les Ambassades and Mamoun's Falafel, and for romantic meals he recommends Prune, August, Daniel, The Elephant and Peasant. What I Learned -- apparently NYC chefs and restaurateurs love Spotted Pig (but we knew that), Prune (we figured that), Peasant (actually didn't know that), Shake Shack (who doesn't), Daniel (cause they can afford it), Mamoun's Falafel (hottest hot sauce in the city), Peter Luger (even hard for them to get in) and Katz's.

Wine Spectator announced today its much-anticipated list of the Top 100 Wines of 2008. According to WS, they reviewed more than 19,500 wines from around the world in blind tastings. More than 5,300 of them earned outstanding ratings (90 points or higher on the WS 100-point scale). They then narrowed the list down based on four criteria: quality (represented by score); value (reflected by release price); availability (measured by case production or cases imported); and an X-factor they call excitement. The final selections, however, reflect WS \"editors' judgment and passion about the wines they tasted.\" As perhaps expected, several 2005 Bordeaux (the vintage of the century) made their way onto the list, including 3 of the top 10 and 4 of the top 11 wines. Lets hope for WS's sake that no fake wines made the list. Click here if you're not sure what I'm getting at. The Top Values ($20 and under) in the Top 100 after the jump... I immediately pored through the list for the $20 and under wines and found 19 wines priced at $20 or less.

Undergrounds Unite: The Full 12-Course Tasting Menu
***AUTHOR
Andy
***DATE
2008-11-16 19:11:00
***CONTENT
We attended the Undergrounds Unite 12-course Thanksgiving-inspired feast on Friday night. Undergrounds Unite is a consortium of five of the city's underground supper clubs. Late Wednesday we got an email from UU about the undisclosed loft location where the feast would be held. Here's what it said: So, wondering how it works? -Please arrive at the Playwright (35th between 5th and 6th about halfway down the block on the North side) promptly at 7:45PM. Look for the man learning \"How to Cook Everything.\" He will direct you to the location of the feast. -At 8PM we will begin the cocktail hour. Feel free to mingle with guests, say hello to new and old friends, and choose your seat accordingly. Dinner will begin promptly at 9PM. -We will be serving wine with the event (Brooklyn Oneology), but feel free to BYO if you prefer another type of drink. The menu and more after the jump... So we headed over to Playwright Tavern a bit early not really knowing what we were looking for other than someone who was learning how to cook. There was a fellow sitting at a table by himself outside the bar who was reading a book -- but it looked more like a classic than a cookbook. Walking further into the crowded bar we spotted our guy. At the corner of the bar, a guy was sitting with a big hardback cookbook open and propped on its spine as if on display. We walked over and he handed us a map. Right about now we're feeling like we're on some sort of scavenger hunt. The map pointed us towards a building one block away on 36th and it said to head up to the 11th floor. We got there and a line for the elevator had already formed. The elevator let us out in the middle of a massive commercial duplex loft penthouse space with 2 bars set up and some couches and lounge areas. I had expected a more wanna-be hipster crowd, but everyone here was dressed very chic and stylishly. We immediately made our way to the long line at the first bar. The first half of the cocktail hour involved people waiting in the 2 cocktail bar lines and engaging in linear conversations with the people in front and behind of them. Nick behind the bar from Whisk & Ladle was the mastermind of the cocktail list, which included a bourbon with infused vidalia onion and peach (my favorite), a peanut-infused vodka, a tequila cocktail with agave and grapefruit, a vodka, cider, and champagne concoction, and lastly a gin with green tea (but we failed to try this one so don't remember the ingredients). As a little amuse bouche, they placed trays on tables with fried risotto balls with toothpicks stuck in them. We tried a couple and they were really nothing special. The lines at the bars died down as everyone had their first couple cocktails and then anxiously awaited the dinner bell to head upstairs. We took our seats at a communal table, met the people around us and then the feast began: Our one disappointing takeaway from the meal was that everything was served way too cold. Course #1 (Bread): Fresh Buttermilk Biscuits w/ Honey Butter -- Homeslice West The biscuit was quite generic and barely lukewarm. Course #2 (Raw): Fluke w/ Yuzu Kosho & Vinaigrette -- Studiofeast The fluke was delicious and I enjoyed the topping of what tasted like a chili-caramel sauce. Course #3 (Pasta): Toasted Pumpkin Agnolotti w/ Spicy Pepitas & Brown Butter -- Lightbulb Oven Unfortunately, this was served too cold, but was quite tasty and fresh. Good ingredients. Course #4 (Soup): Slow Roasted Red Pepper w/ Dungeoness Crab -- Homeslice West Served cold, but delicious fusion of pepper and crab flavors. Course #5 (Fish): Seared Striped Bass over Spinach Ball w/ Parnsip Puree -- Ghetto Gourmet Great fish course. Bass seared perfectly and complementary flavors. Course #6 (Sorbet): Cranberry Citrus w/ Apple & Celery Gelee -- Studiofeast Course #7 (Pork): Buta No Kakuni / Japanes Pork Belly w/ Napa Cabbage & Pickled Daikon -- Studiofeast A bit too fatty, but very tender and tasty. Unfortunately, it was served too cold. Course #8 (Poultry): Turducken Roulade w/ Oyster Andouille Stuffing -- Homeslice West My first ever taste of Turducken, and while it was too cold to do it justice, I thought it would have more flavor to it than it did. It was already midnight at this point! Course #9 (Salad): Arugula, Roasted Cranberry & Cornbread Crouton w. Blue Cheese Vinaigrette -- Lightbulb Oven Salad was pretty good...especially like the cornbread crouton. Course # 10 (Beef): Beer Braised Brisket w/ Southern Style Grits -- Homeslice West & Lightbulb Oven This one took me back to my southern roots. Great braised brisket and loved the grits. Course #11 (Cheese): French Double Cream Brie, Cow's Milk, Boorenkaaf Raw Cow's Milk, Aged Gouda, British Stilton -- Ghetto Gourmet Course #12 (Dessert): Dark Chocolate Pistachio Linzer Torte -- Whisk & Ladle Wine Pairings -- Brooklyn Oenology (sources grapes from North Fork). The wine was flowing freely. First 6 courses -- 2007 Social Club White & 2006 Social Club Red Next 6 courses -- 2007 Chardonnay or 2006 Motley Cru We also brought our own wine from Shinn Estate Vineyards in the North Fork.

Sound redundant? I thought so too until I realized there actually is a wine producer that calls itself 'Recession Wines.' Apparently, they are offering 2 Recession Reds, a Cabernet Sauvignon and a Merlot, and 1 Recession White Chardonnay. The best part by far is their promotional video featuring Recession Wines' spokesperson Poris Hilton. You gotta see this for yourself. Lets hope their wines have better taste than their advertising. Some stores in Manhattan that sell Recession Red and Recession White: Warehouse W&S, 67 W&S, Gotham Wines, 86th St. W&S, and McAdam/BuyRite in Murray Hill.

Over the past couple of years, we've been hearing alot about super-secretive supper clubs that have been popping up around the city (like NY Bite Club) which hold multi-course tasting dinners semi-regularly in private lofts and apartments around town. This weekend five of these underground supper clubs will be joining forces for a massive, 150-seat communal dinner in an undisclosed midtown loft. Somehow Jill was able to score us 2 seats by sending an email them through their website for a password. The so-called \"Undergrounds Unite\" shindig will feature a 12-course meal, with each dinner club handling three courses each. We just got the email disclosing the secret location and how things will work this morning. More on the participating, 'not-so-secret anymore' dinner clubs after the jump... homeslice west is a \"culinary speakeasy\" with a new southern feel. Part dinner party, part underground restaurant, at its heart, homeslice west is about bringing people together in an intimate dining environment conducive to conversation and laughter over great food. It's unpretentious, casual southern goodness. Studiofeast is an invitation-only culinary collective that focuses on promoting emerging and undiscovered gastronomic talent. We are a platform for new ideas and frameworks in dining and express our selves through the Studiofeast and studiofeast | presents feasts. But above all, we're firmly rooted in the spirit of fun and the pursuit of the good life. The Whisk & Ladle In the far reaches of Manhattan's Inwood neighborhood, one woman (with a little help) founded a supperclub that seemed to stand up against the onslaught of the \"bar-restaurant\" culture. Abiding by the traditional structure of the dinner party and out of the deeply entrenched belief that all things civilized and debaucherous find common ground on a dining room table, the Whisk & Ladle supperclub was born. The Ghetto Gourmet was one of the original underground dining pioneers, beginning in early 2004 as a Monday night \"pirate restaurant\" in a basement apartment in Oakland, CA. As a \"wandering supperclub,\" the Ghet produced over 350 community dining events from coast to coast last year. Today, they've expanded to become a \"dinner party network\" where adventurous foodies connect, share info and eventually dine together. Light-Bulb Oven Light-Bulb Oven is a Brooklyn-based culinary salon in operation since February 2007. Powered by seasonal ingredients, lively guests and more than a little irreverence, Light-Bulb Oven is a place for adventurous eaters to try new flavors, make new friends and generally have a good time.

We picked up a bottle of this Wine Spectator 90-pointer from our local wine shop last night to pair with our homemade Top Chef dinner. We had no idea at the time this under $12 riesling had just received mention in the Nov. 15th issue of Wine Spectator as a great value buy, but we can see why. It had really nice floral and apricot flavors and aromas and is a perfect fall weather wine. We would recommend pairing with asian food, mexican food, indian food and it would also be a nice wine for Thanksgiving dinner. Click here to find it in your neck of the woods.

Ready for a 'culinary boner'? Our favorite tv show starts up again tonight on Bravo at 10pm. Needless to say, we're pretty psyched. We'll be keeping with tradition from last season and preparing a home-cooked meal beforehand to enjoy while we watch the show...and what's a Top Chef premiere without a recession special value wine. On tonight's menu is Tabla tikka-marinated chicken breasts on the grill, caramelized broccoli with garlic, and one of Jill's famous salads. As for the wine, we will be trying a value riesling, which we heard pairs nicely with spicy Indian food. We'll let you know which one we try and how it is. For those of you without cable, you can watch with Colicchio himself, who will be hanging out and eating dinner in the lounge at his Craftsteak during the show's airing. Craftsteak is extending their bar menu ’til 11, when it ends. We've been hearing some good things about the $15 and under bar menu, from the burger, with its layer of balsamic onions, to some of the best smoked chicken wings in town.

Recession Wines: Extreme Times Call for Extreme Values

***CONTENT
With the worldwide financial crisis in full swing, it’s a time when a lot of wine lovers will be looking to dial back their wine budgets. From people we've spoken to and articles we've read, it seems that most are still drinking the same amount of wine, but less expensive selections. With that in mind, we've decided to launch a new feature called “Recession Wines.” More on \"recession wines\" and a couple of Thanksgiving extreme value picks after the jump... Extreme value wine doesn’t always mean cheap wine, so we will explore the most extreme values in all price categories. We're talking about the $10-20 wines that give $30-40 wines a run for their money. Also, we'll take note of those $30 wines that make you shake your head and wonder what others are charging $75-$100 a bottle for something similar. And even wines you can buy for 8 bucks or less...and we're not talking Two Buck Chuck or Boone's. Now that the days of summer are gone we are shifting gears from the great value sauvignon blancs, rosés and lambruscos to the Austrian grüner veltliner, spicy malbecs, carmeneres, dry and semi-dry rieslings, gewürztraminers and sparkling wines. Here are two (one red and one white) extreme value, food friendly wines that we think will go well with not only the turkey (the easiest part of the pairing since so many wines pair well with turkey) but also with the myriad of seasonal side dishes that make an appearance at the turkey or trudunken dinner. 2004 Bodegas Montecillo Rioja Crianza ($7-$12) While pinot noir is the typical go-to Thanksgiving red (especially Jill's favorites from Burgundy), we've found Tempranillos to work nicely, too. The nice thing about tempranillos is that so many quality ones are available at great value prices. This happens to be one such great bargain tempranillo. There are aromas of roasted herbs and spicy berries, and nice, high-toned red fruit. Nice acidity and balanced tannins make for a long, juicy aftertaste. Click here to find it in your local area. Chateau Ste. Michelle Riesling 2006 (Columbia Valley; $10) 2006 seemed to be a pretty good year for the Washington wine area. This great-value Riesling in a slightly off-dry style, with a nice balance of acidity. White peaches, honeysuckle, and a pretty minerality. Click here to find it in your local area. Stay tuned as we search the wine world for bottles that you would guess are up to 5-10 times more expensive than they really are.

Budget Brunch at Arcane: Low Expectations but Impressive Results

We should have known better- arriving at the Sunburnt Cow at prime brunch time on a Sunday... What were we thinking? After learning of the over 1 1/2 hour wait to partake in the biggest Sunday Funday all-you-can-drink brunches/parties in town, we decided to go elsewhere. We were intrigued by the french/chill/islandy music and the very budget friendly brunch menu at Arcane, a French-Caribbean restaurant at 111 Ave. C between 7th and 8th Street, so we decided to take a risk and give it a try. Arcane's vibe, music, and lack of an hour (or longer) wait beckoned us inside. The waiters and the bartender were incredibly friendly- all with strong French accents, trendy East Village garb, and big smiles. We were sat immediately underneath a colorful (mobile-like) hanging of voodoo dolls. The space had nice modern lighting, tropical plants, lighted candles, and a big wooden bar. The music was great and almost had Andy rocking out on the air bongo. Our waiter was sure to close the door so we were not cold at our table by the entrance- without us even asking. More about our low expectations-high results brunch after the jump... The menu featured brunch items all around $10 that came with a brunch cocktail + coffee or tea. It was cash only and we certainly had to ask what some dishes were (remember, French-Caribbean brunch). I had the omelet of the day (swiss cheese and mushrooms accompanied by flavorful potatoes and a little salad with mustard vinaigrette). Andy had the baked eggs (a casserole dish filled with baked eggs, a zucchini-like vegetable, ham) which he loved. I was amazed at how good my simple omelet was- fresh herbs, marinated mushrooms, and a healthy portion of hot, melted cheese. It certainly exceeded my expectations. I also was impressed by the \"rasberrini\" brunch cocktail (champagne with raspberry puree), and the mango version of the champagne cocktail was also tropical and delicious. Andy had a bloody mary, but asked for hot sauce to kick it up a notch. He was given traditional tabasco, but also a home-made hot sauce that beat any bottled sauce I ever tried. It had serious heat and was made from yellow peppers (it looked like a yellow pepper relish, but it surely was more spicy than sweet). I had to devour a couple of pieces of the steaming hot french bread after a fork full of the hot sauce. Even though Arcane is not an all-you-can-drink brunch spot (drawing a packed house like Sunburt Cow), you could make your own boozy brunch at Arcane for a very reasonable price. My under $10 omelet included one brunch cocktail and all additional cocktails were only $4. We were so impressed with Arcane's food that we asked to see a dinner menu. We will certainly be back for the conch stew (reminding us of our days in Turks & Caicos) and the jasmine rice. I love a taste of the islands as the New York brisk fall/winter weather sets in, so I am very much looking forward to my next meal at Arcane.

Beer Bar/Gastropub: Waterfront Ale House
***AUTHOR

***CONTENT
Before there was the Spotted Pig and before the rise of the gastropub, there was Waterfront Ale House. You would never guess from the outside that this Murray Hill saloon (there's a second location in Brooklyn's Cobble Hill) serves up some amazing grub. A hand-painted sign on the wall self-depracatingly proclaims this pub to be the \"Home of Warm Beer, Lousy Food and an Ugly Owner.\" But make no mistake about it, the beer is served at the perfect temp, the food is anything but lousy and as far as owner Sam Barbieri's looks go, you can decide for yourself (he's the one on the right holding his famous homemade egg nog). Given its location adjacent to the Kips Bay movie theater, Waterfront Ale House has been a part of our dinner and a movie night routine for some time now. What's not to like about a friendly, neighborhood bar where you can choose among great beers, grab free popcorn from a self-serve popper and order just about anything from a diverse and fairly eccentric comfort and game food menu and know that it's gonna be pretty darn good. The taps are constantly changing and the kitchen features sublime pub fare with many comfort food favorites, including great burgers and award-winning bbq. It's the perfect spot to grab a beer and a bite on a rainy day, which is exactly why we decided to head over there on Sat. afternoon...more of what we love about WAH after the jump... During holiday season, we love the warm cozy atmosphere and the famous house brand 'Serious Egg Nog'. It's so tasty and full of good rum that we usually take a couple of bottles home with us. It is our no. 1 holiday drink. Other signature libations include the homemade granny apple infused vodka and \"painkiller\" rum punch. The specials listed on the blackboards are a menu onto themselves. Don't expect your normal pub fare here with specials like venison stew, bison burgers, exotic soups, duck liver pate and other hard-to-find game meats with a twist. They were even offering a Grilled Caribbean Pork Loin with a Ginger and Guava Glaze when we were there. Owner Sam Barbieri is an avid barbecuer and has several trophies to attest to his prowess. I've had the 'pulled pig' sandwich and it was downright great bbq. There's an assortment of different hot sauces lining the walls and on the table, but none comes close to Sam's famous house brand (available for purchase). Using what tastes like Habanero peppers as a base, this hot sauce achieves the near impossible balance of being both flavorful and as someone on Citysearch puts it \"still boasting a heat that'll blow through the roof of your skull.\" Not to worry, there are plenty of great draft beers to help wash it down and put out the fire. Jill and I couldn't find an open cab yesterday, but we remembered that Tylenol has been running a promotion right across the street from our apartment offering free rides to anywhere in Manhattan in London-styled taxi cabs. We started with a crock of french onion soup. This 4-onion soup with porter, which the bartender told us is the chef's mom's recipe, is delicious. The porter really added a depth to the beef broth, the bread was thick and brown, the onions were soft and tasty, and the cheese was properly melted over the side of the crock with a nice crispy brown coloring. It was also topped with freshly chopped chives and peppers. I started with a Magic Hat Roxy Rolles, a hoppy amber, and Jill with a Maudite, a strong belgian ale from the same brewery as Le Fin Du Monde. I also tried the Dogfish Head Punkin' Ale, one of the better seasonal pumpkin ales I've tried. They also had two warm cask ales, one of which was a Six Points Otis (oatmeal stout). Click here to check out the current beer list. For my lunch, I had the french dip au jus and Jill went with a grilled vegetable focaccia sandwich with fresh mozzarella and sun-dried tomato pesto. People also swear by WAH's burger and some call it the best beer+burger in town (they also have famous waffle-cut fries). Maybe we'll feature it in an upcoming Burger Wars. We look forward to our next dinner+movie night soon...even if the movie isnt' great, we know we won't be let down by dinner at Waterfront Ale House.

Here's one that may be too good to refuse. For a limited time, you can choose either a free bottle of wine or 20% off your food at Philip Marie in the W. Village. Click here for more on this deal. Apparently they also have an unlimited mimosas/bloody mary's brunch that we need to check out, too. Read what Zagat says about Philip Marie after the jump... ZAGAT Ratings & Review Food Decor Service Cost 19 17 19 $42 “Every neighborhood deserves” a “convivial” fallback like this West Village New American, whose “pleasing” fare tastes even better amid the “romance” of the downstairs “secret room for two”; “jazz lovers” also note that the “Wednesday evening music is truly a delight.”

Babbo Revisited (unfortunately, only figuratively)
***AUTHOR

***DATE

***CONTENT
It's been close to a fortnight since we ate at Babbo and I can't stop thinking about the grilled octopus with “borlotti marinati” and spicy limoncello vinaigrette (thanks to Solo for recommending this), the mint 'love letters' pasta with spicy lamb sausage, the papardelle with butter, parmesan and (generously shaved) white truffles, the guinea hen special...even the complimentary amuse bouche chickpea bruschetta was amazing. We were planning to both do the pasta tasting menu, but since it was close to 11pm when we finally got seated, we went with a mini-tasting recommended by our server instead. Pics and descriptions of the meal after the jump... Our sommelier recommended a nice under $100 Barbaresco that she said would match perfectly with our tasting items. Babbo, as Jill can attest, is one of the most difficult NYC restaurants to get a reservation at, especially if you're using a phone. Jill called right at 10am exactly a month ahead of time and patiently waited on hold for more than an hour, and still was only able to get a 10:45pm reservation (past our bedtime). (Disclaimer: these are not our pics...we find it disrupting not only to others but to our own dining experience to whip out a camera and start snappin' photos at a nice restaurant...we just don't want to be \"those people.\" I have to say we even feel a bit uncomfortable and slightly annoying taking photos at bars and casual restaurants.) Here's what Mario Batali had to say when asked by a food blog about Babbo's photography policy: \"Do you mean folks like bloggers? Our photo policy is that we do not allow lights or taking photos of other customers but do not stop joyous foodies clicking an occasional photo of the food on the table with a small camera. If it starts to feel like a photo shoot or they flash more than twice, we ask them to stop for the comfort of other guests. I pose with guests for hundreds of photos a year in the resto.\" Let the food porn, albeit courtesy of some other \"joyous foodies\", begin: The slightly spicy and slightly tangy chickpeas were nicely bathed with balsamic vinegar and spooned over thick toasted bread. Had we not observed a server shaving copious amounts of truffle over this dish for a couple of people dining at the bar, we may not have know to ask about it. So, when it came our turn we were excited to see the same guy come by with the white truffle and proceed to pour shavings over wide hand-cut noodles dressed with butter and a grating of parmigiano reggiano. It was at this point that our dinner reached epic proportions. The noodles were an ideal choice, as their large size seemed to encourage the truffles to spread out nicely and served as a nice canvas to let the truffles strut their stuff. The heat of the pasta added to the aroma and decadent taste of each and every truffle shaving. They split the dish onto two plates for us and we both agreed that it seemed we each got our own full dish. The pappardelle truffle was a hard act to follow, but this pasta recommended by our server did not disappoint. These mint, pea and sausage stuffed raviolis were served hot and proved to be small, explosively flavorful little packets of goodness. The mint filling was a refreshing breath to the pasta and it was different than any pasta dish we’ve ever encountered. He also recommended a Goose Liver Ravioli with Balsamic Vinegar and Brown Butter, but we decided to save that for next time, though it may have to be the time after next time if we can afford Babbo's eight-course truffle tasting menu the next time we go. Finally, we split a special on the menu: a roasted guinea hen, that to our surprise (and joy) was served boneless. By this time, we were in sheer food heaven. Very impressive that Babbo has been able to seemingly only get better with time, while so many other restaurants peak early and then steadily decline. We'll be back, but next time we may opt to sit in the bar area at a more reasonable time of evening.

Burger Wars Part I: Molly's vs. The Smith
***AUTHOR
Jill
***DATE
2008-11-03 14:13:00
***CONTENT
The winner, but which is it? When times get tough, the tough eat burgers and drink beer, or at least we do. We thought it would be fitting to kick off Burger Wars by pitting a couple of wallet-friendly burger + beer deals against one another. The Competitors: I. Molly's Pub & Restaurant: 287 3rd Avenue (22nd & 23rd). Molly's Jumbo 10 ounce pub burger with your choice of cheddar, american, swiss, mozzarella, or blue cheese, served with french fries, potato salad, mashed potatoes, or onion rings (other toppings available for $1). Cost: $11 (+ cost of beer). II. The Smith: 55 3rd Avenue (10th & 11th). The Smith Sunday \"Get a burger and a beer for $12\"- Burger with cheddar cheese, french fries, and your choice of beer. Cost: $12. The final verdict after the jump... The Final Verdict: The unanimous winner of Burger Wars Part I = Molly's. Jill's Winner: Molly's cheeseburger was the clear victor out of these two burgers- it wasn't even close. First of all, let's talk burger... Molly's burger was large, juicy, and perfectly medium rare. It had a charcoal black crispy outside with ridiculously amazing rare and dripping meat inside. The cheese was perfectly melted into the traditional style burger bun (which in turn melted into the burger as the juices flowed at first bite/cut). This is a real burger- forget adding the lettuce, tomatoes, and fixings (although the pickle was a delight- very crisp and sour). I added a bit of ketchup and was in heaven. Definitely the best burger I have had in a while. When you bite into it, expect savory juices to flow all over your hands and plate. You could really taste the meat- no need for heavy seasoning. I ordered the onion rings but had a few of Andy's fries and found both to be top quality and fresh. There are more burger wars to come, but Molly's is one of my early favorites in NYC (and completely underrated). The Smith burger was good and for the price and ambiance, it still gets a thumbs up from me, but it is not even in the same category as the Molly's burger. The Smith burger was a nice size and my cheddar cheeseburger was cooked well. The french fries were thin, crisp, and tasty. The Smith burger came with all the fixings already on it- including what appeared to be a mayo-based special sauce. I would have added all the fixings anyway (for the extra flavor that the Molly's burger didn't need), so I was happy with the pre-assembly. The best part was the amazing beers on draft that came with the $12 burger meal (and a nice size glass). I chose a Blue Point Toasted Lager which complimented my cheeseburger and fries perfectly. I would certainly come back to The Smith (I LOVE their brunch and their dinner menu- the caramelized brussel sprouts are amazing). You really can't go wrong for a $12 tasty burger that comes with a beer from their great draft beer selection, but with Molly's calling my name only 10 blocks north, I think I'll be returning to The Smith when I am in need of something other than a burger fix. Andy's Winner: Also, hands down, the Molly's burger takes the prize. I know it's a bold statement, but this may have been the best NYC burger I've ever had. I think I said \"This is the best burger I've ever had,\" between just about every bite I took. Even the bun was amazing and had perfect grill marks. When my burger first arrived I was a bit disappointed cause I thought it was overcooked. Man was I wrong. This burger was cooked to perfection. It had this perfect char on the outside leading to a perfect juicy medium rare on the inside. I was dying to go back in the kitchen and ask the chef what their secret is. I asked our server and all she offered up is that they add \"a little bit of love\" to every burger. I cannot believe people wait for places like J.G. Mellon and Shake Shack and probably haven't even heard of the Molly's burger. Molly's is a true Irish bar...sawdust on the floor, Murphy's on tap and Irish tunes on the jukebox. I had to request they put American football on the TV. They agreed, but only for the Notre Dame game. I kinda feel bad for The Smith that it had to face such stiff competition. Their burger was cooked perfectly medium rare and I got to wash it down with a Sixpoint Bengali IPA (all for only $12). I just found the condiments to be overly invasive with the default inclusion of the special sauce (think Big Mac) and that they keep this burger from reaching its full potential. I also found the bun to be a bit too \"bready.\" Just never got that nirvana moment of \"Wow, I'm eating something special here,\" like I did with the Molly's burger. On a 100-point scale, I'd give the Molly's burger a 98 and I'd give The Smith's burger an 89. I'll be back for the $12 burger + beer special, but when friends come to town and want to try one of NYC's best burgers, we're headin' to Molly's. .gallery { margin: auto; } .gallery-item { float: left; margin-top: 10px; text-align: center; width: 33%; } .gallery img { border: 2px solid #cfcfcf; } .gallery-caption { margin-left: 0; } Molly's The Smith Menu at Molly's Burger + Beer Special The Smith burger Molly's Andy in Burger Nirvana Sixpoint Bengali IPA & Blue Point Toasted Head @ The Smith Molly's

The best part about Molly's is that it is perennially left off NY Magazine's best burger issue. I'd expect it to win out over many others. Look forward to coming back to see where and what you're up to next. And, if you need a tag-along for a Financial District contest (http://burgershoppenyc.com/), I'm to the task... Be well, you two.

Burgers are all the rage in NYC and have been for quite some time now. There's a burger for just about every taste and budget. You can spend anywhere between a buck and $175 for a patty in this city. I thought that DB Bistro's foie gras burger was the most expensive, but at a mere 32 bucks (n.b. during fresh truffle season, you can add 10 grams of truffles for $75 or 20 grams for $150), it's cheap compared to Wall Street Burger Shoppe's $175 \"Richard Nouveau\" burger consisting of 10 ounces of Kobe-raised beef crowned with a thick “lobe” of seared foie gras, 25 grams of shaved black truffles, and aged gruyere cheese. I'm guessing they haven't been flippin' too many of these bad boys over the past couple of months. What \"Burger Wars\" is after the jump... Neither of these even come close to Vegas' most expensive burger -- the \"Fleurburger 5000\" (you guessed it, the 5000 means doneros) at the Fleur de Lys restaurant in Las Vegas at Mandalay Bay. You wash this burger down with its own beverage as it comes with a bottle of 1990 Chateau Petrus served in Ichendorf Brunello stemware that you get to keep. While we're not gonna be trying any of those burgers anytime soon, we are gonna be tryin' lots of burgers around the city. Everyone has a different opinion on NYC's best burger...for some it's old standbys like J.G. Mellon, P.J. Clarke's or Corner Bistro, for others it's Burger Joint at Le Parker Meridien or Shake Shack. Lately, we've been hearing alot about this amazing burger in Brooklyn from a small, cozy place called DuMont (Zagat 2008 Best Burger). Even Jill and I don't agree on our favorite burgers. There are also tons of places making awesome patties that go unnoticed. For example, would you ever think that Michael Jordan's in Grand Central makes a great burger, or that a polish 24/7 diner in the e. village is known for its burger, or have you heard about the burger at Molly's, or ever foregone the bbq at Blue Smoke and ordered the burger instead? We've decided to have a little NYC burger-off. We're going to try and compare burgers head-to-head from different places across different categories; under-the-radar burgers, pub burgers, bang-for-your buck burgers, brooklyn burgers, steakhouse burgers (Luger's vs. Smith & Wollensky), diner burgers, brunch burgers, 'damn it feels good to be a burgah' burgers...you get the idea. Stay tuned...all this burger talk has me jonesing a big medium-rare beauty. We may have to get things started this weekend. Wall Street Burger Shoppe's $175 Burger

Finger Lakes Weekend: Our Wine Tour of the Keuka Wine Trail

Although we were hoping for a beautiful Saturday on Keuka Lake, we awoke in our barn suite to an overcast sky and some slight rain. It was a bit of a challenge to tear ourselves up from our warm king size sleigh bed and to make it to our 9 a.m. breakfast, but when we were served our homemade spinach and white cheese egg souffle with fresh fruit, organic sausage, and piping hot biscuits, it was well worth it. The juice was freshly squeezed and the coffee was tasty and strong. Thankfully, we did not mind the rain because we had booked a driver for the day so we could enjoy our wine tour without worrying about directions and without worrying about tasting too many wines while driving. Our driver, Ron, arrived early and we were off before 11 a.m. to start the tour. Ron was full of knowledge and gave us insight into the development of the region, the growing Amish farm community, the rising real estate prices of lakefront property, and most importantly the layout and reputation of the wineries. We were having such an amazing day visiting the wineries (and tasting all the fabulous rieslings and gewurztraminers), we decided to forgo lunch to make it to even more wineries before returning to the Inn at 5 p.m. Who needs lunch when you have local cheeses and crackers and when there are wine biscuits at every tasting table? More of our winery tour and some pics after the jump... By the end of the day, the rain subsided and we were treated to a spectacular full arch rainbow over Keuka Lake. The fog lifted and the views from the last couple of wineries were spectacular. Ron was the perfect tour guide and told us not to worry if our tour ran over our allotted 6 hours. The drives from winery to winery took us along lakefront roads and we were surrounded by the bright reds, oranges, yellows, and greens of the spectacular fall foliage. All in all, we learned a tremendous amount about a wine region close to home, made some new friends, and tried some great wines. Hunt Country Vineyards: Hunt Country was our first stop of the day. Although there seemed to be some tour buses outside, we were pleasantly surprised to walk right in and up to the tasting bar without a wait. Alice guided us through our tasting ($2 per person for any 5 wines, fully refundable with the purchase of any wine). Although we were supposed to taste 5, Alice poured us many more. The highlight of the tasting for me was the 2007 Late Harvest Vignoles (superb). The noble rot silky sweetness brought me back to Sauternais region of Bordeaux. I surprisingly found the dry riesling lacking in flavor and overly acidic, especially because I generally prefer dry whites. The semi-dry riesling turned out to be worlds more pleasurable. I did not find any of the reds compelling, but we were surprised by a taste of 2002 cabernet franc (the winery had bought back some cases, so we were offered a taste although it was not on the tasting menu). The winery had a nice little gift shop and also sold handmade ravioli from The Ravioli Shop, a small Rochester ravioli producer. We had just finished breakfast at the Inn so food was not on our mind, but if it was later in the day I'm sure we would have snagged some of the seasonal pumpkin ravioli for Sunday night dinner. Being our first stop of the day, it was hard to rate the Hunt Country wines at first but after visiting the other wineries, I would certainly recommend Hunt Country if you are in the Keuka Lake region. Dr. Konstantin Frank Vinifera Wine Cellars: Andy and I had heard the most about Dr. Frank's wines and understood that they were the highest quality wines in the region, so we were very much looking forward to this stop. We were escorted around the porch (with a beautiful lakefront view) to the second tasting room with about 12 other people as soon as we arrived. There was no tasting fee and our affable tasting guide, Susan, presented two wines to select from each time she poured. It worked out perfectly for us, because we would get one of each and compare. I found the sparkling wines (that they listed as champagne causing me to cringe- being a Francophile myself) to exceed my expectations. Both the Frank Brut and Celebre Rose were lovely and were made with traditional old world methods. The whites were quite nice, but the highlight of the tasting was being introduced to some varietals I had never tried (and never even heard of). The Cuvee d'Amour (the vitus Amurensis varietal from Siberia and northern China), the Lemberger (light style red from Central Europe) and the Rkatsiteli (a hugely popular varietal in Eastern Europe-a white with crisp acidity) were all new to me. It was so exciting to experiment with tasting and comparing some new reds and our guide continued to pour for us after the rest of the tasting group dismantled. We ended up spending much more time at Dr. Frank's than expected. It was one of our favorite visits of the weekend. Heron Hill: Our next stop was Heron Hill. The setting was once again beautiful and the tasting room was unique as it was modeled to resemble the inside of a wine barrel. All of the Heron Hill employees were dressed up in '20s attire and there was nice acoustic guitar music making the tasting room a very festive spot. We decided to taste from the premium menu (at $5 per person), but were surprisingly not impressed with the premium estate whites. I also was not a huge fan of the premium cabernet franc I chose to taste, but both Andy and I loved the late harvest rieseling. There was a smooth honey flavor but also some layers of orange peel and light acidity. Heron Hill had a great gift shop and were able to stock up on the essentials (new foil cutters, stoppers, and cheese boards). Bully Hill Vineyard: We had commented that it would be nice to be in a wine region where the tasting rooms were not overrun with drunken groups of men and women pounding wines for a bachelor or bachelorette party. Boy were we wrong. When we walked into Bully Hill, we walked right into one big frat party. The room was full of groups of men and women celebrating god knows what with underwear on the outside of their pants and giant hot dog and hamburger hats on (not kidding). After being polite and signing the briefs on the outside of some stranger's jeans with a sharpie marker, we began our tasting. Jason, our guide, told us when to sip, told us when to chug, and told us when to cheer. The goal seemed to get everyone drunk so they wouldn't notice what they were drinking. Although the wines were not top quality (some were down right awful- think concord grape juice), the atmosphere was entertaining, and the labels on the bottles were quite artistic. It was a fun stop, but we could not bring ourselves to finish our glasses (of horrendous sugary grape juice) when ordered to do so by our tie-died and mardi gras-bead-clad director of ceremonies, so we ran. Ravines Wine Cellar: The next visit took us to the Eastern side of Lake Keuka to a boutique winery run by Morton and Lisa Hallgren. What sets Ravines Wine Cellar apart from the rest is first of all, the Hallgren's only bought the land in 2000 so it is quite a young operation. Secondly (and I was very excited about this), the winery is run by a French winemaker using Old World winemaking techniques. Morton Hallgren was born in the South of France in Provence where his family owns Domaine de Castel Roubine. Morton studied at the Ecole Nationale Superiure d'Agronomie in Montpellier and even spent a harvest at Chateau Cos D'Estournel (which we passed while in Bordeaux and from which we have bought a lot of wine). From there, Morton worked in Texas, at the Biltmore Estate in NC, and at Dr. Frank's winery as the chief winemaker. The tasting room was a bit packed by the time we got there but thankfully we left the underwear-clad, goggle-wearing, wine-chugging group behind at Bully Hill. We were pleasantly surprised by the quality of Ravines wines and especially enjoyed the whites (try the dry riesling, gewurtz, and sauvignon blanc). We had high expectations for the Meritage (hoping for a nice old world Bordeaux blend), but it did not blow us away. Definitely a step up from Bully Hill and one of the more consistent tastings we had but not our favorite of the day. Rooster Hill Vineyards: Next stop, winery number six. Okay, by now I am forgetting to jot down my tasting notes so not too sure how exact I can be on the wine descriptions. Rooster Hill was a very inviting, friendly place (think large red barn with an impressive amount of rooster paraphernalia- both to admire and to purchase). Although none of what we tasted was remarkable, we found the 2007 Silver Pencil to be quite pleasant. It is surely a good buy table wine and it is slightly sweet with some exotic fruit overtones. I would not pair it with your special grilled branzini with olive, capers, and preserved lemon emulsion, but I would certainly pop it open with the barbecue shrimp kebabs or the summer picnic tuna salad sandwich. We did find ourselves some lovely locally crafted chardonnay strawberry cheese and pepper dusted crackers to take back to the Inn (our stomachs were beginning to growl by now). Keuka Spring Vineyard: Our last stop of our quite long day of tasting was Keuka Spring Vineyard. By now, the fog had lifted and we were treated to spectacular views of the lake. We tried some different whites (I believe we tasted their pinot gris and seyval blanc- but once again, my note taking skills were not at their finest by now). I did very much enjoy their gewurtz and their late harvest vignoles. We also found ourselves some wine-related regional crafts (envision our wine bottles at home now clad with hand carved hanging black beers and moose- now remember how much wine we had before making these purchases). The tasting room had a rustic feel and a beautiful lake view. It was the perfect ending to our day in the country along the Keuka Wine Trail. .gallery { margin: auto; } .gallery-item { float: left; margin-top: 10px; text-align: center; width: 33%; } .gallery img { border: 2px solid #cfcfcf; } .gallery-caption { margin-left: 0; } View of Keuka Lake Alice at Hunt Country Tasting Group at Dr. Frank Drinkin' in the Rain (Heron Hill) Heron Hill Grand Tasting Room 20's Costumes at Heron Hill Frat Party at Bully Hill Is that Jill signing someone's briefs?

Hi Susan here - your taster from Dr. Franks - thanks for your kind words - glad you enjoyed your time at our winery. You have a a great blog that I will continue to follow. I do have to make a slight correction, Rkatsiteli (I remember one of your favorites) is a white wine. Other than that you are a wonderful advertisement for our winery. Please let us know when you'll be back in the Finger Lakes! Cheers ~

We had an amazing time On Sunday on our way back to NYC we decided to hit up some of the wineries on Seneca Lake. We went to Fox Run Vineyards, which I had been wanting to check out after reading of their 2008 Winery of the Year achievement from Wines & Spirits magazine. It may have been because they weren't pouring some of their more highly acclaimed wines, but Jill and I weren't that impressed. Almost everyone we met at our Inn and around the Finger Lakes said we had to visit Hermann J. Wiemer vineyard. We loved our visit here. Great rieslings and we left with a few bottles. We also stopped in and tasted wines at Belhurst Castle. Though we like to stay at small b&b's, we would definitely stay here for a future visit. Thanks for all your great recommendations.

Although we had planned on dinner Saturday night at Warfield's restaurant after our inn keeper told us about a special tasting menu we could try from her friend there, the award-winning chef, we decided on a last minute switch and ended up at The Brown Hound Bistro in Naples, New York. After a long day of tasting (and after popping open another bottle of white with some strawberry cheese and crackers by the fire back at the Inn), we thought driving 3 miles rather than over 30 would be a much better option. We had heard how excellent The Brown Hound Bistro was, but we also heard that with only a handful of tables we may not be able to get in. Thankfully, a couple had cancelled their reservation and we were told to come right over. More on our amazing meal after the jump... After driving only a couple of miles on a deserted Route 64, Andy and I thought our navigation system must have had one too many glasses of wine itself. How could a renowned restaurant be 0.5... 0.4... 0.3... 0.2... miles away in the middle of nowhere? As we got closer, we thought we must have entered the address incorrectly, but then there it was. A little white house with a picket fence emanating a warm, inviting light. We climbed up the stairs of the porch and were amazed by the tiny (but lively) little bar and the tiny little dining room. We were seated immediately and after a quick review of the menu, we knew we made the right choice. After being spoiled by such amazing meals over the past week, Brown Hound Bistro still managed to impress us. We picked our favorite local wines from the day's tastings and we relaxed to the live guitar music in the dining room while looking forward to a relaxing night in our barn suite. I started off with a crisp Caesar salad (salad was much needed after a week of indulgence) while Andy had an unbelievable crock of french onion soup. The most impressive part of the evening was the special I ordered- perfectly medium rare Beef Wellington. The light savory pastry melted into the perfectly tender meat and the fall roasted vegetables and creamy mashed potatoes were godly. It surely beat my One if By Land, Two if By Sea signature Beef Wellington- I could not have been happier. Andy chose the filet with smoked gouda and chived whipped potatoes and petit noir thyme jus- perfection! How did they do it? With friendly service, local wines, and amazing food (and only a couple of miles from our Finger Lakes home), we could not have done better. We finished up the night with some late harvest reisling and a steaming apple crisp. The Brown Hound Bistro, our little cozy oasis in the Finger Lakes, was the perfect escape from everything urban.

Finger Lakes Weekend: Fri Night Dinner @ The Bistro at Red Newt Cellars

Though we had planned to leave the city early Friday morning, we got off to a late start because of work...guess we can't really complain though since it supports our wine habit. The late start meant an hour to get through the Lincoln Tunnel and an additional hour and a half of Jersey traffic after that. I was nervous we weren't going to make it in time for our 8:30pm dinner reservation at Red Newt Bistro. Thanks to some fast drivin' (courtesy of our Hertz rental car) and some impressive bladder control, we made near record time and cut down a five and a half hour drive to about four hours and fifteen minutes. We first heard about Red Newt Cellars on Lenndevours, a wine blog that has become our primary source for info on the North Fork wine region and that has added Finger Lakes correspondents to keep readers up to speed with the goings on of that region, too. We were intrigued after reading a post about Deb Whiting, the executive chef and co-owner of Red Newt Cellars, and decided to make a reservation. Our dinner experience at Red Newt Bistro after the jump... We were famished by the time we arrived at Red Newt, located on the eastern side of Seneca Lake, so we didn't waste any time checking out the inventive menu and ordering up some appetizers and, obviously, some wine. Appetizer #1 - House made wheat ravioli filled with sweet potato, dried cranberry, mascarpone and chard in a roasted garlic cream sauce topped with parmesan and toasted walnuts Appetizer #2 - Bruschetta with fresh mozzarella, free range bacon, roasted red peppers, spinach and chipotle pesto Our friendly server explained to us how Chef Whiting uses only locally-produced food and that she has a particular place in her culinary heart for local goat cheeses. Our server also recommended the Roasted Pumpkin Hummus and the Grilled Bacon-Wrapped Scallops on Potato Leek Pancake, leaving us with a pretty difficult decision. The wheat ravioli appetizer, while it could have been served a bit warmer, had a delicious flavor and texture combination. It made for an ideal Autumn starter dish with the dried cranberry, sweet potatoes and toasted almonds giving it both sweet and savory elements. The bruschetta was served hot and it was amazing. Granted I'm a bit biased given my soft spot for bacon, but this appetizer was kickin' with the chipotle pesto adding a nice spicy element. As far as wines go, while Deb runs the kitchen, it is her husband Dave who is in charge of the wine-making process. Red Newt produces one of the few Sauvignon Blanc wines in the Finger Lakes. After all this region is known primarily for its rieslings. Jill went with the 2006 Sauvignon Blanc Reserve while I tried a flight of three 2005 Red Newt Reds (cabernet franc, merlot and cabernet sauvignon). Jill enjoyed her sauvignon blanc but missed the crisp, citrus well-balanced summer taste of the Marlborough sauvignon blanc's. I tasted some fairly big fruit and some acidity on the front of the palate of her wine. Definitely a different style than the New Zealand and Chilean new world sauvignon blanc's we've grown accustomed to, but very good nonetheless. I enjoyed all 3 of the reds I tasted. My favorite was the Cab Franc which had a bright crimson color and light tannins that I could feel the tinge of in my cheeks. I have to say I was pretty impressed with Red Newt's wines. With the local cornucopia of pumpkin, cabbage, winter squash, apples and pears, we were not surprised to see these as ingredients in several of the dinner entrée options. Jill went with the lamb chops special while I had the roasted free range pork chop stuffed with apples, pork sausage, chevre and chard with an apple riesling sauce, served with roasted garlic and sage smashed sweet potatoes and seasonal vegetables. Both of our entrées were great, though my knife was not quite sharp enough for my pork chop, i.e. pork chop was euphemistically a tad overcooked. I had an awesome glass of riesling to go with my big, stuffed chop. The 2006 Tierce Dry Riesling is a collaboration of three of Seneca Lake's top wine producers -- Fox Run (we visited on Sunday and will tell you about soon), Anthony Road and Red Newt. Not a bad way to be introduced to my first riesling of the weekend. Tons of floral notes and citrus popped on my palate. We had a great dinner at Red Newt Bistro and would recommend it to anyone traveling to the Finger Lakes. Unfortunately, we couldn't stay for a nightcap since we still had about an hour's drive to our B&B and it was already 10:15pm. .gallery { margin: auto; } .gallery-item { float: left; margin-top: 10px; text-align: center; width: 33%; } .gallery img { border: 2px solid #cfcfcf; } .gallery-caption { margin-left: 0; } My flight of 2005 reds Jill enjoying some 2006 Red Newt Sauvignon Blanc My stuffed pork chop Jill's lamb chops Havin' a good time at Red Newt

We have so much to report on our amazing weekend away to the Finger Lakes region of New York. Work's got us a both a bit tied up at the moment, but we can't wait to describe and show you some photos of our indulgent and educational weekend. We hit up some fantastic (and some quite unique) wineries...10 of 'em in 2 days. We met tons of nice people...and some very drunk ones. We imbibed large quantities of riesling and cabernet franc and even got introduced to a couple of new grapes we had never heard of. We stayed at a lovely and romantic B&B. We had fantastic meals. And we saw lots of beautiful fall foliage. More coming soon...

We had an amazing dinner last night at Babbo. Actually, it was friggin' decadently delicious. Can't do it justice right now (we're scrambling to finish up some work so we can get out of the city and on our way to the Finger Lakes). It was the second best meal I've had in NYC...actually make that in my life. Ok maybe third best in my life. In fact, I'm adding a \"Best Meals of Our Life\" category to Wined & Dined. First - hands down was Per Se. Second - Pierre Gagnaire in Paris (#3 on World's 50 Best Restaurants List behind El Bulli and The Fat Duck - Per Se is #6) I'll describe Pierre Gagnaire experience in a future post. Our meals at Blue Hill at Stone Barns rank up there, too. These are the type of life-altering meals that make it hard to go anywhere else for a few weeks. It's kind of like committing culinary suicide. I dug up an email Jill sent me a year ago to the day that sums up pretty nicely our experience at Per Se last year (she should write for Zagat). Check it out after the jump... From: Janeczko, Jill To: Freedman, Andrew M. Sent: Wed 10/24/2007 10:16 AM Subject: I can't stop.... thinking about what we ate. The best meal of my life. Hands down. No comparison. I've been raving about it to everyone. I am dreaming about the white truffles with the buttery perfectly cooked pasta. I don't think I'll ever forget that taste or the image of a massive truffle from a gleaming polished box being shaved so there was triple the amount of truffle than pasta! I am imagining the salmon tartar sesame cone with crème fraiche, the little cheese thingies, the salts from around the world and Brooklyn brewery and Riesling infused breads, the salted butter that came from the same 8 cows that made your ricotta with eggplant and marinara sauce, the puree romaine soup with perfectly bite sized fingerling potatoes and a drop of truffle infused crème fraiche, the caviar and pearl oysters in cream with rose champagne, the hollowed out egg shell with buttery truffle custard and rosemary potato chip, the butter poached lobster with vegetables, the beef of which only 4 slices comes out of a whole cow cooked to perfection- most flavorful beef I have ever eaten, the sablefish with the little chorizo and pepper pieces, the quail roasted to perfection with my sweetbreads (still can't believe I ate sweetbreads), the foie gras with my perfectly cooked succulent piece with caramelized pearl onions and your PB&J with a never ending supply of fresh brioche- I loved your quote on that one, the sea bass (of which you ate both our skins), the pomegranate sorbet cleanser with graham cracker and sour cherries, the cheeses with pear and cranberry brioche, the chocolate dessert with the buttermilk ice cream, the sour cranberry cobbler with my creamy sorbet, the coffee custard and your cinnamon birthday doughnut, then they even brought us more with a perfectly cooked crème brule and I don't even know what sort of custardy fruit spectacular you got! Incredible. Best dinner ever!

Maybe our blog would be more aptly named 'Wined & Dined & Chugged.' In the past month we hit up the 2nd Annual NYBrewfest at South Street Seaport and then went with our friends Riki, Kristi and Joe to the Mahattan Cask Ale Festival at Chelsea Brewing Co. Where Jill tends to like the Belgian strong ales (I'm convinced she goes straight to the ABV% (alcohol by volume) and orders accordingly), I'm more a hoppy IPA person. Thanks to our friends over at BeerMenus (great site where you can type in the name of any beer and find all the bars in NYC that serve it), we heard about this new beer bar Rattle 'n' Hum that just opened on 33rd b/t 5th and Mad. We went and checked it out this past Sunday. While we love our rowdy football Sunday Fun-Days at a local bar as much as the next person, I have to say it was refreshing to walk into a bar that was just barely crowded for a Sunday afternoon....and served something other than Stella and Bud Light. If you love craft ales and microbrews, this is your place. Their taps are ridiculous...they have just about everything. The bartender was really nice, too. She must have poured us samples of 5 beers each before we ordered our first one. What we drank and the full beer list after the jump... Jill started with a Stone Arrogant Bastard (would have no doubt gone with a Victory Golden Monkey if they had it) and I went with a Great Divide Titan IPA. My Titan IPA had some aggressive hop flavors with a tinge of citrus and finished with a mellow malty sweetness. Before our second beer, we got to try some cask samples and also the seasonal Captain Lawrence Pumpkin Ale. I have to admit I was expecting a bit more from the Captain here after having the amazing Liquid Gold at the Cask Ale Festival. Jill moved on next to a Dogfish Head 90 Minute and I had an Elysian Avatar Jasmine IPA. Mine was really good, but way too floral and fragrant. You can't go wrong with the Dogfish Head 60 or 90 Minute. We tried some apps also but they were nothing to write home (or here) about. I hear we should have had the sliders. I had high hopes for the curry fries, but the curry was more like a thick gravy. We'll definitely be heading back for the sick beer selection, though. Click here for what's on tap. 2 Responses to \"New Beer Bar: Rattle 'N' Hum Made us Very 'Hoppy'\" # Joshon 22 Oct 2008 at 9:11 pm sounds like the Yardhouse in Palm Beach Gardens # Andyon 23 Oct 2008 at 1:44 pm I miss the Yardhouse.

Zagat's getting in on the \"recession special\" action coming up with 5 French restaurants serving up multicourse dinner bargains. The best deal here looks to be Demarchelier (86th b/t Mad and Park) which is offering up 2 courses and a glass of wine for a scant 26 bucks. While the reviews on MenuPages look to be mixed at best, beggars can't be choosers. Click here for 4 more brought-to-you-by-Zagat French specials.

Recession Special: SushiSamba

We hear that SushiSamba is joining the growing list of NYC restaurants offering a lower-priced menu in response to the economic downturn. The $35, three-course menu includes pan-seared sea scallops, kobe beef with ponzu gelee and Japanese mushrooms, and warm chocolate banana cake. It's available for dinner, Sundays through Thursdays. And while several high-end restos are lowering prices to lure budget-minded diners, some notorious NYC cheap eats are having to raise their prices to meet increasing costs. The New York Times reported yesterday that Gray’s Papaya will be raising the price of its famous “recession special” (2 dogs + drink) from $3.50 to $4.45. Pop Burger in midtown just raised the price of 2 pop burgers from $5 to $7. More Recession Specials after the jump... Dennis Foy in Tribeca has introduced a $27 Recession Special. Click here for the menu. Megu has introduced a $55 prix fixe menu in addition to its seven-course $125 tasting menu. Realizing that a $180 nine-ounce Kobe beef Chateaubriand is now beyond the reach of many customers, Megu has started offering an appetizer portion for $35. Jack Bistro, a French-American eatery in Greenwich Village, offered a \"Dow Depression Special\" while the market was crashing the past couple of weeks. Every time the Dow Jones index dropped, they took a corresponding number of cents off the price of their dinner entrees. Thus, when the Dow dropped 100 points, Jack reduced the price of its dishes by $1. The New York Post ran an article last week to help NYC diners save some moolah. The theme was \"If you like so and so expensive restaurant, then you should try so and so less expensive restaurant with similar food.\" Here's a midtown happy hour recession special to report. TG Whitney's (53rd b/t 2nd and 3rd) is offering complimentary wings, chicken tenders and potato skins on the house during happy hour (4pm to 8pm), on the hour, Tuesdays and Wednesdays.

Each year, more than 50,000 spectators converge on the rolling hills of Moorland Farms in Far Hills, NJ, for the states' biggest social event of the fall season -- The Far Hills Race Meeting. The race in 2008 marked the 88th running, and the Far Hills Race features some of the finest steeplechasers in the world competing against a beautiful autumn setting. But it's not the horses that are the real draw here. The Hunt is all about the tailgating. Walking around the infield we saw everything from a 5-foot tall champagne glass, beer pong tables and bean bag tosses to hot spiked ciders, pitchers of bloody mary's, sangrias, mimosas and wines. This day was all about good friends, beer, gourmet food, beautiful fall weather, jumping horses, champagne, betting, wine, more beer, more horses, liquor, and more food. Check out the pics after the jump... .gallery { margin: auto; } .gallery-item { float: left; margin-top: 10px; text-align: center; width: 33%; } .gallery img { border: 2px solid #cfcfcf; } .gallery-caption { margin-left: 0; } Another year, another Hunt Toasting it up What horse do you like, Josh?

Supper in East Village: Only Pay For What You Drink

***DATE

***CONTENT
The East Village is a treasure trove of great restaurants serving up super values. Probably for the better, many of these places have stayed off the Zagat, NYMag and Eater radar screens, leaving the East Village restaurant scene one of the few remaining in the city where you can drop in any number of places off the street without a reservation and have great food and drink for a relative bargain. Our friends Josh and Nicole recently enjoyed a meal at East Village standout Supper. Supper is the sister restaurant of two other East Village value spots, Frank and Lil' Frankie's. Josh will be describing in more detail the unique wine deal and more about why they liked Supper in a comment below. Apparently, what sets Supper apart is its unique wine program, where they charge you by consumption. So you can order a number of bottles and drink from each according to your desire, and then they weigh each bottle at the end and charge you in quarter-bottle increments.

Mollydooker Tasting Mon. Night @ Nick & Stef's

***CONTENT
I was excited to hear last week about a Mollydooker wine tasting at Nick & Stef's restaurant. We came across Mollydooker last year when we bought a bottle from local wine shop Crush. We had the 2006 Mollydooker \"Two Left Feet,\" a blend of Shiraz, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot. At about $20-$25 retail, it's one of the best of the Australian value wines we've tasted. Simply put, this is great juice! Here's what Parker says about it: The 2005 Two left feet is blend put together by Sarah Marquis. It boasts an inky purple color, superb intensity, a big, sweet, full bodied nose of crème de cassis, graphite, white choclate, black olives, blackberry liqueur, anmd spice, and a spectacular, voluptuous, even unctuous texture. This is a big, powerful, classic southern Austrlian red made with no compromises. Drink it over the next 3 years, though I suspect it will last a decade or longer. 94 Points. Robert Parker Jr Wine Advocate #165 Unfortunately, some of the higher end Mollydooker's are just way out of our price range. We've heard all the raves in the wine mags about the award-winning Velvet Glove, but at $250-$300 a bottle retail, it's just not gonna happen. So what better chance to get a taste of wines that fall a bit out of our price range than at a wine tasting event led by the owners and winemakers of Mollydooker, Sarah and Sparky Marquis. For $85 a person, we're getting to taste 10 Mollydooker wines and have a dinner prepared by the executive chef at Nick & Stef's. No offense Nick & Stef's -- but we're a bit more excited for the wine part of this event. This price includes tax and tip. Though it's a bit steep, our typical meal at an NYC steakhouse runs about $200-$300 depending on what bottle we select. Looking for Mollydooker in NYC. Where you can find it after the jump... Sherry-Lehmann Found a cool new website, Vinquire, that allows you to type in any wine and a zip code and shows you some wine shops where you can find it. Click here to see where Mollydooker can be found.

The beauty of living and working in midtown is that you can take advantage of so many free wine tastings...even during your lunch hour! I received an email from Sherry-Lehmann today at 12:45pm reminding me of a Cristal tasting event taking place today and tomorrow between 2-4pm with Frédéric Rouzaud, the President & CEO of Champagne Louis Roederer Group. So I high-tailed it over to Sherry-Lehmann at 2:10pm and was back in the office by 2:40pm. During that time, I tasted a generous pour of the 2002 Cristal, had a conversation with Monsieur Rouzaud, met Michael Aaron, the retired Chairman of Sherry-Lehmann, and picked up a sandwich. Not bad for a day's work-lunch. .gallery { margin: auto; } .gallery-item { float: left; margin-top: 10px; text-align: center; width: 33%; } .gallery img { border: 2px solid #cfcfcf; } .gallery-caption { margin-left: 0; } Frédéric Rouzaud Michael Aaron with Frédéric Rouzaud Retails for $260/bottle The scene at the Cristal tasting Frédéric Rouzaud showing his stuff Outside Sherry-Lehmann

Napa in New York: Wine Spectator's California Wine Experience

***DATE
2008-10-17 13:06:00
***CONTENT
 Last night we attended the Grand Tasting that kicked off the weekend-long California Wine Experience in NYC. Though it was a hefty price to pay at $250 a pop, it did not disappoint one bit. Perhaps the best feature of this tasting, besides all of the top-scoring wines, is that the owners and winemakers are all on-hand to meet, greet and talk about their wines. There doesn't come a more passionate and friendly group of people than vineyard owners and winemakers. Just about every owner we spoke with (of vineyards both large and small) invited us to come out for a private tour and tasting whenever we happen to be in the area. We were also excited to re-unite with our friends, the Harpers and the Wallaces, from Texas who we met back in June on a 6-day tour of Bordeaux. Like us, they are huge wine nuts and travel to NYC every year for the entire weekend of wine tastings and programs. Their collective wine knowledge is boundless, and we learned as much talking with them as we did from the winemakers. Thanks to our friends we were able to get in to the private tasting held between 6:30-7:30pm before the masses arrived. It was like being a kid in a candy store walking around and seeing the likes of Araujo, Groth, Diamond Creek, Kosta Browne, Paul Hobbs, Far Niente, Harlan, Heitz, Opus One, Pahlmeyer, Kistler, Joseph Phelps and the list goes on and on. In fact, almost all of the cult cabs were represented minus one -- Screaming Eagle. According to our friends, it was the first year Screaming Eagle has not taken part. It truly was mind-boggling to have the opportunity to taste all of these prestigious California (and some Oregon and Washington) wines, some of which retail for anywhere between $150-$650 a bottle. These are the wines I dream about ordering with my filet at a Del Frisco or Palm, but can't rationalize splurging for, i.e. can't afford. We'll be posting our tasting notes soon, but here are some of the wines we tasted and people we met: D.R. Stephens Estate - Our Texas friends had met the Stephens on a trip to Napa and were invited for a personal tour of the vineyards where they were given the royal treatment. The owners' son and his wife were on-hand. Click here for restaurants in NYC that serve D.R. Stephens wines Araujo Estate -- We tasted a phenomenal cab. Frank Morris in our group referred to it as \"Silver Oak on steroids.\" Merry Edwards -- We are on the Merry Edwards mailing list and were excited to visit them. Known for their outstanding Russian River Valley pinot noirs, they were tasting their 2005 Sauvignon Blanc, which has been getting amazing reviews. The 2005 Sauvignon Blanc was named 40th in Wine Spectator's “Top 100 Wines of 2007.” Merry's husband, Ken, was on-hand (his business card actually reads \"Merry's Husband\"). He is so engaging and has such an unbelievable personality. We loved getting to meet and speak with him. There's so much to be said for getting to know the people behind the wine. Here are some other pics...we will be posting about other wines we tasted and people we met shortly. The Grand Tasting Groth Stag's Leap

First Taste: Obika Take-Out = Euro Trash
***AUTHOR
Andy
***DATE
2008-10-15 14:33:00
***CONTENT
After two unfruitful attempts to try the much-hyped Obika take-out, I finally got my shot today. By the time I arrived, all they had left was a mozzarella and sun-dried tomato piadina (not sure what the difference is between this and a panini, but it's on piadina bread). They heated it up for me and I was off. As an aside, for my $8.67, I was expecting maybe a nice, euro-designed Obika bag to walk back to the office with to put the world on notice of what I had just scored. No such luck. The so-called piadina was wrapped in tin foil and placed in a plain white paper sack. No biggie. It's what's on the inside that counts, right? So on to what matters, the food. I was first struck by how ridiculously small this pia-thingie was. We knew that for only 8 bucks it wasn't going to be a whopper of a panini, but this was a bit absurd. I'll give Obika the benefit of the doubt that after running out of paninis and pia-thingies before 12:30pm two days in a row, they decided to cut them in half to see if they could make it through an entire lunch service. I was next struck by how little there was in this pia-majiggie. Two parts of a sun-dried tomato with a little bit of mozzarella melted on it, a couple of tiny pieces of arugula, and that was all. Lastly, I was struck by how salty it tasted...almost to the point of inedibility. Am I the only one out there with this awful first Obika experience? I would have thrown the rest of it away, but there was no 'rest of it' after 2 bites. I immediately went down to Europa and grabbed a pressata for comparison purposes (and because I was still starved). It was 3 times the size and tasted much better. Three days in, and it's already time for Obika to get their proverbial 'merda' together. .gallery { margin: auto; } .gallery-item { float: left; margin-top: 10px; text-align: center; width: 33%; } .gallery img { border: 2px solid #cfcfcf; } .gallery-caption { margin-left: 0; } Obika Piadina in Reynold's Wrap Is this a joke?

Recession Special: The Dish by AMEX = 20% off meals, but is there a catch?

These days it seems like everyone has a website that is related in some way or another to the NYC restaurant scene. American Express is now getting in on the action with the launch of The Dish. According to the website, \"The Amercian Express Dish is a community of people who love to dine. It helps you find great restaurants, rave about your favorite spots, save at premium eateries, and discover where people with similar dining habits go for a great meal.\" I decided to sign up to see how The Dish could help fellow, card-carrying NYC \"winers & diners\" save some moolah, or if it was all a gimmick. Here's what I found... After signing up, I clicked through to the \"All Offers\" section of the website to check out some deals. I was surprised to see more than 40 restaurants offering 20-25% discounts...places like Aquavit, Artisanal, Fiamma, Primehouse, The Red Cat, Mai House, 5 Ninth and Cafe des Artistes. I clicked on Primehouse as a test to see what the catch is, and here's the deal. In order to qualify for the 20% discount, you have to book your reservation directly through The Dish website. Easy enough. A calendar shows all available reservations for the next 14 days. For Primehouse, you can only book parties of 1-4 people and the 20% discount is only available for certain reservation times: 2-4pm or 5-6:30pm or 9:30pm-11pm -- important note: reservation times and # of people per party vary by restaurant, with most restaurants being more restrictive with their time slots than Primehouse, i.e. only after 10:30pm certain nights or only available for lunch, as in the case of Il Mulino. The less popular the restaurant, the less restrictive the available discount reservation times. For example, Nick & Stef's steakhouse has reservations available for 8-10pm on weekends. Ok, so there's at least one catch. You can't book highly sought after reservation slots and get the deal. Still, it's not so bad for a Thursday through Saturday night to book a 9:30pm reservation and arrive at 8:45pm or so. In my experience, unless you're at Babbo or Per Se, your table will be ready well before your reservation time. Next, I wondered if there were any other catches to this deal. Will I look like a cheap schmuck to my server when it comes time to pay the tab (I hate using coupons at restaurants)? Do the 20% savings only apply to food and not liquor or wine? Is there a minimum tab amount to qualify for the discount? Do the 20% savings apply to tax and tip? I was pleasantly surprised to learn that the server will likely not even know my party is dining on a 20% coupon, and if they do know through the restaurant's reservations system, they will have comfort that it won't affect their tip. The discount applies to everything (tax, tip and liquor) and there is no minimum tab amount. Only negatives are the restricted reservation times and limited to 4 people or fewer. Here's a description of what AMEX refers to as a \"Statement Credit Offer.\" With statement credit offers the restaurant does not apply the offer to your restaurant bill at time of purchase. Instead, American Express automatically applies the offer as a statement credit to your American Express Card account statement. Here's how it works: Complete your restaurant reservation on New York Dish. Dine at the restaurant at the appointed time. Pay your restaurant bill in full with the American Express Card registered to your American Express Dish account. American Express will apply the offer as a statement credit to your monthly American Express Card account statement. Your savings will be calculated against the full amount (including tax and tip) charged to your American Express Card. Most statement credits will post to your account in 3 - 5 days but please allow up to 60 days for the credit to appear on your American Express Card account statement.

Work Week Lunch: Best Food Cart Salad in Midtown

Halal Cart on 55th b/t Park and Mad Street food vendors are all the rage right now in Midtown. They have cult followings (at least the good ones do) and even have their own Vendy Awards. Thanks to Midtown Lunch, I have discovered quite a few food carts to add to my work week lunch rotation. There's the new taco truck near Bloomies (try the spicy lamb taco -- unreal), the Biriyani cart with their roti rolls, the famous 53rd and 6th Halal cart, all the dessert trucks, and many more. One problem is that it's difficult to eat healthy when picking up lunch from a street vendor. These guys aren't exactly catering to a Jenny Craig audience. Healthy-minded food cart fans, look no further. The Halal Cart on 55th b/t Park and Mad serves up a Greek Salad with Grilled Chicken (either spicy or regular) that I will put up against any salad from Chop't, Cosi, Just Salad, Europa, Lite Bites, City Market, you name it. The salad ingredients are fresh, the feta is great and the chicken is grilled as you order. Not to mention, there are 2 quality salad dressing options -- a balsamic vinaigrette and a caesar. All for 6 bucks. If you know of any other food carts serving up salads like this one, let me know. Greek Salad w/ Spicy Chicken Fresh Ingredients Every Day

According to Eater's walkthrough and photo tour of the new Shake Shack UWS, a wine list is in the offing...and after a quick once over of the wine board, the prices are unbelievable! Some of the wines are even priced just at or even a bit below retail. Is this too good to be true? Lets hope not. This is exactly the type of news budget-minded New Yorkers have been waiting for. It's no secret that people have had enough of the outrageous wine pricing at NYC restaurants. That we should be made to pay a 150-200% mark-up for the so-called privilege of getting to drink a bottle of wine in a restaurant is absurd. Will this mark the beginning of a new era?

After reading on Midtown Lunch that Obika has finally opened, I scurried over from my office to the indoor Trump pavillion at the corner of 56th and Mad to see if this place really lives up to all the hype. While Midtown Lunch raves about the under $10 takeout menu, unfortunately all that customers can take out today are croissants and pastries. I was assured that the full takeout menu would be available tomorrow. Looks like they have some affordable Italian wines to pair with your lunch. Unfortunately, I don't think you can take those out. I did manage to grab a glimpse of some patrons lunching on some fresh and delicious looking mozzarella and nice-sized paninis and snapped a few pics at the scene. .gallery { margin: auto; } .gallery-item { float: left; margin-top: 10px; text-align: center; width: 33%; } .gallery img { border: 2px solid #cfcfcf; } .gallery-caption { margin-left: 0; } About time!

One of our favorite comfort food destinations is Cafeteria in Chelsea. Although we love the Cafeteria \"Mac Attack,\" we do not love receiving the bill after enjoying a number of their great strawberry mojitos (it does add up!). So, we decided to try HK for a very wallet friendly all-you-can-drink brunch yesterday. The bright white decor and outdoor seating made us feel like we were at Cafeteria (except for the fact we were a block away from Port Authority rather than a block away from all those great Chelsea boutiques). First, we were happily suprised when we learned that we could begin our all-you-can-drink $12.95 special at the bar while waiting for a table. We made some friends and received great (very energetic) service from our bartender, William. We decided to wait on a table outside (or semi-outside), so we took full advantage of the all-you-can-drink bellinis, mimosas, bloody marys, and champagne before we even sat down for brunch. Andy ordered the stuffed chicken with jalapeno cheddar mashed potatoes- William's recommendation- and I ordered an egg white omelet with brie and asparagus. Both meals were delicious, but Andy was definitely the victor with the stuffed chicken. The chicken was deliciously stuffed with goat cheese, sun dried tomatoes, capers, smoked bacon, and basil and the cheddar and jalepeno mashed potatoes were the best mashed potatoes I have tried in ages. Not the traditional brunch order but an amazing hearty balance of savory flavors and spice. Our meals came out to about $26 and our all-you-can drinks specials about the same ($12.95 per person, cash only). For an endless glass of champagne, bustling atmosphere, tasty meal, and friendly service, you cannot go wrong at HK. We will certainly be back. .gallery { margin: auto; } .gallery-item { float: left; margin-top: 10px; text-align: center; width: 33%; } .gallery img { border: 2px solid #cfcfcf; } .gallery-caption { margin-left: 0; } A bustling brunch scene Bellini #1 (all-you-can-drink special starts at the bar!)

For those of you not familiar with Fronsac, it is a wine region, i.e. appelation, in Bordeaux that sits side by side with St. Emilion and Pomerol. It is less well known than its famed neighbours but is a good match for them. Fronsac is known for wines that are made with great care but don't cost a fortune. With a super vintage like '05, you can score some great Bordeaux wines from Fronsac and other not so well known areas that won't break your bank.

As part of the New York Food & Wine Festival, Gordon Ramsay sat down with Kim Severson of the New York Times for an interview and audience Q&A at the Times Center on Saturday afternoon. We are used to enjoying Ramsay's colorful personality when we watch Kitchen Nightmares and Hell's Kitchen, but we were not sure what to expect from the Chef in a sit down interview in front of an audience full of fans. We were pleasantly surprised to learn that Ramsay's fiery personality was just as entertaining in an on-stage interview as it was on reality TV. Ramsay did not hold back as he answered questions about his shows, his restaurants, his family, and his upbringing. He was charming, passionate, blunt, and very funny. Although some may have found his responses offensive (for example, his reference to a Parisian girlfriend in bed- it was like having a rottweiler chained to his chest), we found Ramsay's no holds barred style refreshing and definitely engaging. When he signed our book afterwards, we were even more impressed when he took the time to speak with us and to ask us questions. Although every other word out of his mouth may be an expletive, Gordon Ramsay is truly a class act. Meeting Chef Ramsay

NYC Wine & Food Festival: Price is Right Tasting with Josh Wesson

We attended a double-blind wine tasting in the depths of the Gansevoort Hotel led by Josh Wesson of Best Cellars. There were eight glasses of wine laid out in front of us: 2 bubblies, 2 whites and 4 reds. We knew that the wines ranged in price from $5 to $92 and we were given 8 specific prices ($5, $10, $17, $25, $37, $50, $72, $97) with each wine corresponding to one of the prices. Josh informed us that all of the wines were very highly rated, most receiving 90+ Parker and Wine Spectator scores. His aim was to show us how price does not always correlate to quality and that we are sometimes misled by our inherent price bias. Our goal was to taste each of the wines and correctly match a wine to its price. While we were close on most of the wines, we did not match a single wine to its actual price...as it turns out, we weren't alone either. Most people failed to correctly match a single wine to its price. We did, however, nail the identity of most all of the wines we tasted. Jill's highlight was correctly identifying the white bubbly as a Cava...pretty impressive. Great wine tasting overall. I guessed the $5 wine cost $50, making it a steal. It was a Meritage blend. .gallery { margin: auto; } .gallery-item { float: left; margin-top: 10px; text-align: center; width: 33%; } .gallery img { border: 2px solid #cfcfcf; } .gallery-caption { margin-left: 0; } The Price was Wrong...but the wine was great Jill ready to taste away Our tasting leader, Josh Wesson The Russell Crowe \"Gladiator' Method of Judging Wines

While hundreds of others were across the bridge in Brooklyn at Rachel Ray's Burger Bash, we decided to hit up the venerable, iconic Corner Bistro in the West Village for some post-City Winery burgers and beers. We ate at stools by the bar with a perfect view of the Red Sox-Rays game and West Village people-watching. For a grand total of $29, we each had 2 McSorley's Ales, a cheeseburger and fries. The burgers were unreal. My past few experiences here had been fairly disappointing. I was actually wondering if it was too late to drive a couple of these beauties over to Brooklyn and crash the bash. This was the ideal Friday night budget-conscious meal out. In fact, we're happy anytime we get out with a tab under $100 on a weekend night. .gallery { margin: auto; } .gallery-item { float: left; margin-top: 10px; text-align: center; width: 33%; } .gallery img { border: 2px solid #cfcfcf; } .gallery-caption { margin-left: 0; } Mc'Sorley's Ale ($2.50 a pint...nice) Hello gorgeous A Pretty Darn Near Perfect Burger McDonald's-like shoestrings (a metaphor for our budget) Delish!

Last night we got invited to visit City Winery, New York's first private label winery. City Winery is the brainchild of Michael Dorf, an NYC entrepreneurial visionary who founded the Knitting Factory. Dorf and his team have transformed an old warehouse on Varick in the western reaches of Soho into a bi-level winery with tons of amenities, including 2 wine bars, professional kitchen, dining space, private event space, huge barrel room, stage for live music and events and much more. After a quick tour of the facilities, we were put to work -- fun work- de-stemming Cabernet grapes that had just arrived by refrigerated trucks. In fact, these very cabernet grapes that we were handling were hand-picked less than a week ago from one of several sourcing vineyards in Napa selected by City Winery. City Winery also sources its grapes from the Russian River Valley, Mendocino, Willamette Valley in Oregon and from local vineyards in the North Fork and Finger Lakes regions. I have to say there is something strangely therapeutic about moving your hands through cold, wet freshly picked grapes (actually look more like blueberries). We worked on the de-stemming line until vertigo had just about set in and then sampled some pre-feremented Zinfandel and Rose. .gallery { margin: auto; } .gallery-item { float: left; margin-top: 10px; text-align: center; width: 33%; } .gallery img { border: 2px solid #cfcfcf; } .gallery-caption { margin-left: 0; }

[...] Mendoza, and the crush was just starting when we arrived. Because we had some fun getting our crush on previously at City Winery, we decided to leave the grape sorting behind for some serious wine tasting. Good [...]

We grabbed some tickets off Craigslist this week, below face I might add, to a couple of events at Food Network's New York City Wine & Food Festival. Here's what will be attending: Session 5: The Price is Right Hosted by Josh Wesson (Sold Out) Location: Hotel Gansevoort, 18 Ninth Avenue btwn 13th and Gansevoort Streets Hours: 1:30 p.m. - 2:45 p.m. Price: $85 [not including tax and service fee] Sold Out This playful yet educational seminar will take a cue from the Price Is Right game show to give participants the opportunity to experience the double-blind wine tasting technique in an exciting and revealing way. Expert Josh Wesson will select up to eight wines of varying type and from different regions around the world. Their market value—between $5 and $100—will be listed on a board without any hints as to which price tag goes with which bottle. It will be up to everyone to use their wine knowledge, along with information provided by Wesson, to make educated guesses as they attempt to accurately price each bottle. And don’t be surprised if the wine you enjoy least turns out to be the most expensive and vice versa: Wesson will explain some of the factors—including issues of stock availability—that figure into pricing. This seminar will be introduced by Travel + Leisure's Features Editor, Nilou Motamed. GORDON RAMSAY: \"Yes, Chef\" Whether he’s raising turkeys and pigs at home in England with his kids or yelling expletives at lackadaisical would-be chefs, Gordon Ramsay gets your attention as an advocate of simple, local food prepared well. You’ve seen him on TV (“Gordon’s Kitchen Nightmares,” “The f Word,” and “Hell’s Kitchen”), read his cookbooks and perhaps eaten at one of his restaurants. Now meet him in person to find out what gets him really excited. Interviewed by New York Times food reporter Kim Severson. One of four conversations about food and wine at The TimesCenter, in collaboration with the Food Network New York City Wine & Food Festival and celebrating the New York Times Magazine Food Issue.

3 courses, 3 wines for $38 until 10/17 We know that Benoit, Alain Ducasse’s latest New York restaurant in the old La Côte Basque space, has been panned left and right by the likes of Adam Platt and Bruni. But it's still Alain Ducasse, right people? Let us not forget that with his plethora of restaurants, cookbooks, endorsements and line of cooking supplies, Mr. Ducasse had three restaurants with three Michelin stars each—at the Essex House in Manhattan, the Plaza Athénée restaurant in Paris and the Louis XV restaurant in the Monte Carlo. In the 1990s, Mr. Ducasse became the first chef in 60 years to win six Michelin stars at once, for his restaurants in Paris and Monaco. And in 1990, at 34, he was the youngest chef in France to be awarded three Michelin stars, for his Monte Carlo restaurant. Despite what Platt (Alain Ducasse’s Benoit takes the New York brasserie craze to new lows), Bruni (Alain Ducasse's heart just isn't in the place) and countless others on Chowhound have had to say, we know a great NYC deal when we see one. As part of the Food Network New York City Wine & Food Festival's Wine & Dine NYC, Benoit is offering a three-course tasting menu and get this....each course is paired with a different New York state wine, all for a ridiculously low price if you use your AMEX card. We can't beat that price eating in, so we're going to go check it out and we'll let you know how it is. Benoit better be careful...prices this low can you get you Deathwatch'ed in some circles. Click here for the menu. Click here for more info on participating restaurants.

Jill cooked up one of the most innovative break-the-fast spreads I've ever seen. Everything from a gourmet smoked salmon plate to a twist on your grandmother's matzo brei and a bagel and cheese strata. Fasting is much easier when you have this feast to look forward to: .gallery { margin: auto; } .gallery-item { float: left; margin-top: 10px; text-align: center; width: 33%; } .gallery img { border: 2px solid #cfcfcf; } .gallery-caption { margin-left: 0; } Smoked Salmon Platter Matzo Brei with Creamed Spinach and Crispy Onions Jill showcasing her Bagel and Cheese Strata dish Barely enough room on the plate What break-the-fast would be complete without a great value 2005 Bordeaux?
