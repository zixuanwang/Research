128 East 7th Street between First and Avenue A 212/473.0220 $40 each for two, with drinks, without tip ♥ ♥ I'm always excited to find another Greek restaurant in the city. I was even more thrilled to try Pylos because I walked by its glass wall one night and took a note of it as a must-try when I make it back to the neighborhood. When a friend wanted to meet for dinner before heading out on a Saturday night, I suggested that we go there even though I never got a chance to look it up and read about it. I later learned that the owner partnered with Diane Kochilas, a widely recognized authority on Greek cuisine, to be the consulting chef-I now remember the cookbooks on display in the restaurant. We started with crispy phyllo dough filled with cured beef pasturma, tomatoes and kasseri cheese. The flavor was subtle but very savory. The octopus was grilled and I couldn't get enough of the balsamic reduction on the plate. It could have used a lot more of the sauce though, so that the octopus was a little bit more flavorful. They had ran out of the anchovies and the cabbage leaves stuffed with rice and ground beef, so we immediately moved to the main course of grilled baby lamb chops which were perfectly medium-rare and soft, served with stuffed eggplants and slivers of fingerling potatoes. The chops were so good they made up for the maitre d' who huffed and puffed when we inquired to be seated without a reservation on a Saturday night. We got the table next to the giant glass wall under a ceiling covered with unglazed clay pots. (Pylos stand for \"things of clay\", see?) The street lamp outside illuminated our side of the restaurant and gave the front section a warm glow while the back room looked like a long dining hall. Everyone around us seemed like they've been going to Pylos for years since most tables were comprised of bigger groups. I'd have to come back with my own posse, but I've taken a more detailed note: Pylos is a nice little spot without the frills of a New York City Saturday night. It was perfect for two friends and could be perfect for a first date.

Where to eat in Norwalk, CT: Valencia Luncheria

Arepa is a South American patty made of cornmeal which can be grilled, baked or fried and usually topped or stuffed with cheese or meat. Other areas in Latin America have something similar; the El Salvadorian pupusa being the most familiar to me. So how good can arepas get? If you ask me, it's all about the filling because I can't tell if the dough was laboriously made or if a store-bought cornmeal was used. I like my arepas light but filling; go easy on the meat inside and you'll make me frown. Valencia Luncheria is very generous with their arepas. Between my friend and I, we ordered several arepas stuffed with pulled pork, shredded beef, chorizo, roast pork, chicken and cheese. Out of all of them, the pulled pork was probably the best, followed by the shredded beef which had some sweetness to the sauce. The spinach and cheese arepa was a godsend after all the meat and I wished I ordered more of it. The chorizo wasn't moist enough-I ended up picking and eating them on their own. After my third, I was skipping the cornmeal and just eating the filling. We also ordered ceviche at a whopping $10 for a small cup and it lacked oomph in the seasoning department. I like my ceviche less on the tomato slush and more on the lime and cilantro flavor. We went just in time before dinner rush began. A few groups were waiting for tables right by the counter when we left. With the downpour outside, everyone congregated in Valencia's tight quarters. Apparently, it gets even more crowded on the weekends during brunch. There's no beer or liquor for sale in the restaurant, but there is a deli a few stores down where you can buy to bring your own. Still, our bill for three people went up almost $70 and I think I was just stuffed more than I was satisfied. Valencia Luncheria is at 172 Main Street in Norwalk, Connecticut. You can call 203/846.8009 to ask how long the wait is for brunch. Related post/s: El Salvador and pupusa photos on Flickr Colony Pizza in Stamford, Connecticut

210 East 3rd Street between Avenue B and C 212/614.3080 $158 for 4, with drinks, with tip ♥ ♥ One of my favorite things about eating with friends? Sharing food. One of my least? Wasting food. So I was taken aback when I read the footnote on the Cafe Cortadito menu that a fee would be tacked on if main courses are split between guests. I'm not exactly sure as to why they would stop diners from sharing a dish because each one is ample for more than one. It probably made sense when they were still waiting for their liquor license, but now that you can order a pitcher of champagne sangria and a few glasses of red wine, sharing a ropa vieja with a bottle of Cab between friends just makes more sense to me. Chef Ricardo Arias is Salvadorian, and his wife, Patricia Valencia, is from Ecuador, but you wouldn't know any of that when you taste the Cuban-inspired food. The meat dishes were delicious; the skirt steak was well-seasoned and I couldn't stop eating the chimichurri salsa. The oxtail braised in tomatoes and red wine reminded me of a good family meal. I didn't finish my dish but I ate as much as I can that I had heartburn for the rest of the night. Of course, I could have skipped the maduros, or the sweet plantains, but I couldn't help myself from ordering something else besides meat. By the end of the night, I was pining for fresh and green vegetables with a shot of whisky to push everything down. I'm not a big fan of paying a lot of money for Latin food because I grew up in Washington Heights in New York City and was surrounded by very affordable home-cooked meals from the Caribbean and Central America. Besides, most of the Cuban restaurants I've tried were not even good enough to warrant a review. Cafe Cortadito changed all that: the food is simply tasty even if I couldn't share all of it.

I was attracted to Nisi after a press release came in about their Easter weekend special: lamb on a spit. I've been around many pigs and cows on spits before but never a whole lamb, so I jumped on the chance to partake during one of the biggest Greek religious holidays of the year. For some reason, I had a picture in my head that we'll be on New Jersey greenery whiling away our Sunday afternoon with drinks in hand. Not so. The lamb were definitely roasting on spits just outside the restaurant, but they were along a busy main road next to the parking lot. We didn't really spend any time outside watching the lamb cook because it seemed silly to be standing on hot concrete when there were white tablecloths waiting inside the spacious and airy restaurant. I was disappointed, for sure, but I soon got over my expectations when the food started to come in. The grilled sardines were superb with capers and only a drizzle of lemon juice and good olive oil. Grilled sardines made me happy when I was in Tunisia-the closest I've ever been to the Mediterranean-and I can't wait for the day when I finally go to Crete and someone's grandma will feed me the same dish on the beach. The octopus was so tender, it disappeared in under five minutes. The magiritsa, a soup made of lamb offal, was the most delicious soup I've had in a long time. Thick from the avgolemono, or egg-lemon mixture, and rich from the lamb parts stewing for several hours, it made me want to have the flu just so I can eat a whole pot of it. It's that kind of soup that would make you feel so much better if you were under the weather. The sweetbread was soft and rich and we couldn't get enough of the carp roe mousse with ground almonds and the roasted eggplant spread. When the roasted lamb was finally served, we were glad to see some of the best parts on our plates. It was amazing to me how the lamb was cooked evenly just outside the restaurant. I grew up experiencing roasting animals as a part of a bigger event and I was pretty impressed that this could be done at Nisi without the hoopla of an entire village partaking in the process. I have to mention something about the service. When we first walked in, we were taken aback at how formal everything looked. We felt out of place because we were the only couple in the entire restaurant; everyone else was seated with their big families. Our waiter, however, made us feel relaxed. He gave us tidbits about Greek food: the red egg on the traditional braided bread, or tsoureki, symbolizes the blood of Christ and the renewal of life, while the magiritsa is eaten to break the 40-day fast undertaken by Greeks during Lent. He was also very helpful in guiding us through which Greek wines matched our meal. He encouraged us to order per glass since we expressed our limited knowledge in Greek grapes and he happily poured us small tastes to steer us towards the best-tasting ones. We might not have danced or screamed opa! that weekend, but because the food harmoniously came together, we felt like we had our own celebration of Greek Easter at Nisi. Nisi Estiatorio is at 90 Grand Avenue in Englewood, New Jersey. Call them at 201/567.4700 and ask the next time they roast lamb outside.

Pancit Canton, Filipino Noodles with Stir-Fried Vegetables

I skipped swimming tonight to run some errands I've been putting off the last week so all I wanted for dinner was something healthy and quick to make. I wanted a lot of half-cooked vegetables and imagined a lot of crunch to my meal. I immediately thought of cabbage and bubble and squeak, but I didn't really feel like eating potatoes. I turned to the Filipino pancit after I remembered that I still have a package of cooked noodles from the Khmer Legacies swag a couple of weeks ago. Canton noodles, one of the many Chinese influences Filipinos call their own, are long egg noodles that have been precooked and dried before packaging and thus only require a few minutes to cook. Time the prep just right and you'll be slicing and dicing while the first batch of vegetables are cooking. This way, your time is spent efficiently and you avoid overcooking any of the ingredients. The worst is to eat soggy noodles. You can use angel hair noodles as a substitute here; just cook them al dente and toss with the vegetables before serving. Ingredients: 1 pack of pancit Canton noodles 2 cups of chicken broth 1 small head of cabbage, sliced into strips 1 cup of dried shiitake mushrooms, soaked in water then drained, roughly chopped a handful of string beans, roughly chopped 1 small carrot, roughly chopped 2 red bell peppers, julienned 1 onion, chopped 3 cloves of garlic, minced peanut oil sesame oil soy sauce juice from 1 lime salt 1. Heat some peanut oil in a large skillet. Saute garlic until brown and onions until soft. Add cabbage and toss until covered in oil. Let cook for about 5 minutes while occasionally mixing. 2. Add the carrots and cook for another 2 minutes. Then add the softened mushrooms, string beans and the bell peppers. Keep tossing all the ingredients together to cook evenly. Add chicken broth and cover the skillet for 3 minutes to steam the vegetables. 3. Meanwhile, soak the noodles in a bowl of water to soften them. Gently separate noodles by hand. Drain, uncover the skillet and add noodles with the vegetables. Drizzle some sesame oil for flavor and season with salt and a jigger or two of soy sauce to taste. Toss for another 3 minutes to make sure the noodles are evenly distributed. Remove to a plate and serve with lime juice for a little sting.

25 West Houston Street between Greene and Mercer 212/219.2113 $196 for two, with five drinks, without tip ♥ ♥ I knew I shouldn't have ordered the $22 glass of Barolo but the guy behind the bar gave me a taste after I picked the $16 Muraglie and convinced me that it was the better way to go. It was a very good glass of wine and I gingerly drank it with the meats and cheeses that we ordered as appetizers, as well as with the asparagus salad topped with fried duck prosciutto and egg. For $20, we had a choice of five cheeses and salumis: we split the cacciatorini, the sweet coppa, the finocchiona and the Calcagno with the Testun al Barolo. I loved the subtle spring taste of the trout main dish with the fava beans, sprouts and sweet peas; a few pieces of morels upped the price to $28. I have walked by Centovini several times but never paid much attention to it because it looked far too dark from the outside. I thought the space would be a little too romantic to meet a friend, so I was surprised at how bright it actually was inside. We sat at the bar under the massive mirrored lamp and even felt like a surgery can be done right on the marble-top counter. The rest of the restaurant is quite handsome, with a beautiful wall of wine shelves in one end and a lounge area in another. The service was unobtrusive because they knew to leave us alone the entire time we were there. The bartender seemed to just show up whenever we needed to refill our wine glasses. And as to not interrupt our conversation, we would nod and just give him an okay-that makes for a very hefty bill after two and a half hours. You can still get away with a much simpler dinner-and less wine-before heading to Angelika Theater without spending too much. A three-course prix-fixe is available every night for just $38 while brunch on weekends goes for $18. Centovini isn't Lupa but I think it's a good spot to start the night off right. Just make sure you don't order the Barolo. Related post/s: Kale and bacon salad recipe inspired by Lupa I still have to try Shorty's .32 which was at the Goblin Market space

Now that everyone knows what ramps are, I don't have to go to Vermont to rummage for them or pay $5 for a bunch at Whole Foods. The farmers market have settled on the $2.50 price for each small bundle and more than one tent sells them now. I still find them pricey-the Spotted Pig still gets away with charging $13 for a plate of it-so I've gotten used to pickling my own every spring to make them last longer than a week. After getting my first few bunches to welcome spring this year, I still had a couple to play with. With some pancetta in the fridge, I decided to add some cold rice to make a very onion-y fried rice. I matched it with some mâche tuna salad and lentil soup to make a hearty lunch box the next day. Ingredients: 2 bunches of ramps, thoroughly washed, roots sliced off a thin sliver of pancetta, diced 1 egg 1 cup of leftover white rice, crushed with the back of your spoon salt, pepper 1. Sweat the pancetta in a skillet with some hot oil and continue to cook until a little browned. Toss in ramps, season with salt and pepper, and saute until wilted. 2. Add rice and fry until warm. Crack the egg into the pot and mix with the rice until scrambled. Related post/s: Pickle your own amps for some martini Lentil soup recipe to match

You know it was bound to happen, right? A month into my new job in Connecticut (yes, that Connecticut), I've had several chances to hitch rides with co-workers and try a few places for lunch. Since I don't know how to drive, I'm at the mercy of those with cars and I go wherever they want to go. It's been really nice to treat lunch time like a new food adventure because I never know what I'm going to get. Some of the places we've been to were meh, but a couple have been really decent. Now I've never really been a big fan of pizza. I think it's because pizza reminds me of college and college reminds me of how poor I was. On a student budget, I ate poorly. As soon as I started to make money, I swore to myself that I was never going to go back to eating bad food again. \"Bad\" here, of course, is both in taste and in nutritional content, and pizza usually qualifies for both. I like my Otto and I like my John's on Carmine just like anyone else, but never again will I \"get a slice\" because it's 1am and I'm stumbling home from a bar-Han Bat in Koreatown is open 24 hours and I can get a better hungover meal there-and never again will I think pizza is \"good because it's cheap\"-I can still get a plate of pork chops with rice under $5 from Chinatown. But go ahead and convince me otherwise. Let me know where you get your pizza and I'll give it a shot-my boss did. He drove a couple of us from work during lunch to the notorious Colony Grill in Stamford, Connecticut. He wanted to prove to me that Colony's pizza isn't just regular pizza; it's its own beast. He talked up the hot oil so much, I also got excited about it. I ended up liking the dive bar feel of the place and it seemed like the waitress knew every customer by name. We must have waited 45 minutes for three single pies and we were starving by the time they were served. I inhaled my sausage pie with stingers, or hot peppers, on the side without blinking an eye. The hot oil was not exactly spicy, but it made even the pepperoni better; the vegetable pizza was definitely better with it. I was speechless on the drive back to work and I was comatose the rest of the afternoon in my cubicle. College days be damned; Colony has some good pizza. Colony Grill is at 173 Myrtle Avenue in Stamford, Connecticut. You can call 203/359.2184 ahead to order but you'd still have to pick your pie up. Related post/s: Otto pizza is thin and crusty

1410 First Avenue between 74th and 75th Streets 212/517.6860 $105 for two, with drinks, with tip ♥ ♥ I have to be honest with you here: I'm not one hundred per cent sure I was at Tsuki. I'm pretty sure it was Tsuki because it's one of the restaurants I have noted on my iPhone, but I have so many pending reviews I think I might have some of them mixed up. It wasn't that the food was forgettable-as far as omakase sushi goes that won't break the bank, the selection was pretty fresh and pretty good. There was nothing stunning about the interior because there was hardly any decor, and really, only this photo survived that night: I'm a little embarrassed that I'm showing my age here, but I've racked my brain and I still can't confirm that it's Tsuki I'm supposed to be reviewing. Help me out and I'll edit later, but let me continue and tell you about the place anyway. We walked in around 930pm on a weeknight. Everyone else decided to stay indoors because it was cold out, but we were hungry after attending a retail store party with free sparkling wine. There were already two couples and a single diner sitting at the short bar, and because we always prefer to sit by the chef, we waited for our turn to sit there. Everyone left at the same time and we were able to move after only ten minutes. For the rest of the night, there were only three people with us inside: the chef, who also doubled as the dishwasher; the waitress, who could have been the chef's wife and who also answered the phone; and a white guy in chef's whites who returned from a food delivery but settled behind the bar after he had removed his coat. It certainly looked like a family business with, perhaps, the white guy as an apprentice, but they seemed like they needed an extra hand or two to make things run smoothly. We ordered our sushi piece by piece from the chef because he looked like he couldn't handle more than two orders at once. He fulfilled orders that were called in and he ran back and forth from the kitchen to get clean serving plates. Meanwhile, the waitress picked up the phone, cleared the tables and packed deliveries while also refilling our water glasses. It took us two hours to go through a dozen sushi pieces each but we killed time by drinking Sapporo and cold sake. Although some of them fell apart while I tried to eat them, the restaurant had a varied selection that included hokigai, or red clam. The mackerel was great and the uni was fresh. After a while, eating there felt like we were in the Japanese couple's dining room: we waited to be served; they waited for our feedback. We spoke in hushed tones and bowed every time plates were exchanged. We were comfortable and an inconvenience at the same time, staying after every guest had already left. I'm not sure if the frail couple reminded me of my parents but I felt very melancholy the whole time I was there; watching them work so hard to keep the night, and their business, alive. Sadness and sushi don't make a good combination and maybe that's why I've blocked the restaurant name out of my head. Related post/s: Le Bernardin was excellent, but it felt very stuffy

Call it pan-bagnat or Nicoise salad in a bun-I'm calling it a tuna sandwich. The weather turned over the weekend and we scrambled for last-minute plans on Saturday morning. I woke the Dr. from a deep slumber to see if he wanted to get out of the city and hike. He wasn't very happy when I found out that the last available Zip Car was parked in the garage five blocks from my apartment. He was grumbling when I fed him congee with preserved duck egg for breakfast; he was still grumbling when he drove almost an hour up to Cold Spring; and I swear he was still grumbling as we struggled up big rocks on Breakneck Ridge. I had prepared these tuna sandwiches while waiting for him to pick me up. He was expecting a packed lunch in return after being disturbed from his otherwise uneventful Saturday, but I don't think he knew he was going to get a very good one. I was glad when he couldn't stop complimenting me about them. They not only woke him up; he didn't mind having someone push him into having a good weekend after that. Ingredients: 1 can of good tuna in olive oil 3 bread rolls, halved 2 eggs, hard-boiled, sliced 1 tomato, sliced several pieces of olives, pitted 1 small red onion, sliced a handful of mache or arugula For the dressing: 2 anchovy fillets, minced 2 garlic cloves, minced 1 tsp red wine vinegar 1/2 tsp Dijon mustard oil, salt, pepper 1. In a small bowl, mix together the dressing ingredients except for the oil. Slowly drizzle in oil, whisking constantly. 2. Spread some of the dressing on one half of the bread. Top with tomato and onion slices, then with tuna, olives, greens and egg slices. Drizzle the remaining dressing. Cover with second bread half and firmly press sandwich together. 3. Wrap sandwich tightly in foil, waxed paper or plastic wrap, then place in a plastic bag. Put sandwich under a weight such as a heavy book. Unwrap, slice and serve immediately.

72 West 36th Street between Fifth and Sixth Avenues 212/947.3636 $130 for two, with drinks, with tip ♥ ♥ ♥ To celebrate my getting a new job during these harsh economic times, the Dr. took me to Keens Steakhouse for their legendary mutton chops. I think I might have to keep him around for a while. The meat from a sheep less than twelve months old is called lamb, and as we all know, is usually tender and mild in flavor. The meat from an older sheep is called mutton, and for reasons I can't find on the Web, is not as popular on New York City menus as lamb. Someone please explain why I can't enjoy mutton much more often! We ordered it medium-rare and it was perfectly bloody and hefty. Keens wouldn't be the only Herald Square Theater District survivor today if they haven't been this consistent since 1885. For lack of better wording, mutton is more manly. I felt stronger and more carnivorous when I was eating it even though we were sharing one $45 chop. There is no lack of male reminders at Keens-the collection of churchwarden pipes from old customers cover the ceiling, from Teddy Roosevelt's to General Douglas MacArthur's. Walking in, you'd think you've entered a museum rather than a restaurant. If it wasn't for Lillie Langtry, actress and paramour of King Edward of England, taking Keens to court in 1905 for having denied her access to its gentlemen-only premises, it will still be a rendezvous of the men's club today. She won her case, swept into Keens in her feathered boa and ordered like a man. Related post/s: Simmering lamb ragu for more than 2 hours I'll take lamb shanks any day, too

I once ordered lamb at a restaurant and was most definitely given a mutton chop. As the lamb carried a $65 price tag, I was very upset to have been served mutton. The restaurant didn't understand why I was so upset. This post makes me feel more normal, like there are others out there who know the difference!

I imagined the healthy and organic produce we will be eating while in Big Sur when I was planning our trip there a week before I started my new job. I knew it was against the ocean and very far from Berkeley, but I didn't predict a shortage of fresh vegetables and good home cooking. I'm still not sure of what I was imagining Big Sur food to be like, but I really thought it would lean towards the hippie and the more natural. In fact, we had a difficult time finding anything agreeable to eat during our two-night stay in Big Sur. We drove 45 minutes away from our lodging and we must have stopped at all the restaurants up north short of Carmel. We walked in a few of them and checked out the menus but nothing was worth spending more than $20, much less sitting for more than an hour when we had to drive back on a dark winding road along the coast. We had driven by Deetjen's on our way up and I reminded the Dr. of it before we gave up our search for a nice dinner. It was nestled among tall redwoods and looked as charming and cozy as it probably did back in the 1930s. We walked in squinting to adjust our vision because low lights barely illuminated the wooden space. The maitre d' tsktsked at us when we told him we didn't have reservations, but he quickly seated us in the Bar Room anyway. Our waitress told us that the soup special of the night was made of chanterelle mushrooms. I excitedly ordered a bowl of it thinking we had finally found organic Big Sur home-cooking. Unfortunately, I only tasted a mild shiitake flavor in the soup. A few minutes later, when the same waitress recited the specials to the next guests, we overheard her say shiitake soup, not chanterelles. She probably couldn't correct herself after she saw our reaction to the mere mention of chanterelles, but I wouldn't have ordered a $10 bowl if she had. The frisee salad with poached egg fared much better and so did the cumin-crusted lamb chops and the seafood paella. Those three dishes made me less sour; a bottle of 2005 Fiddlehead Pinot Noir also helped put me in a better mood. I realized later that getting produce to that part of the coast was difficult and that alone added to the price of the food, but there's no reason to break a girl's heart by mistaking chanterelles from shiitake. Helmuth Deetjen (pronounced dāt′yĕn), a Norwegian who settled in Big Sur before it became the hot spot of Old Hollywood trysts for its seclusion and privacy, bought several acres of land in Castro Canyon with his wife Helen in the 1930s. The couple welcomed intrepid travelers to their barn and built more rooms as the years passed. After their deaths, the Inn was added on the National Register of Historic Places by the U.S. Department of the Interior, and today is operated on a non-profit basis by the Deetjens Big Sur Inn Preservation Foundation. Deetjens Big Sur Inn is located on the Big Sur Coast of California, between San Luis Obispo and Monterey, off of Highway 1 and just 30 miles south of Carmel. It's 300 miles north of Los Angeles and 150 miles south of San Francisco. The sign in front of Deetjens reads Big Sur Inn.

The last bunch of carrots I bought from the market came with very fresh tops. Usually, they're too wet and limp from over-spritzing, but this time I couldn't just chop and throw them away. I remember a time when I was growing up in Manila and cooking. My Uncle Tony was quietly watching me slice some tomatoes. I sliced off the top, where the stem was, and then the bottom and discarded those parts. He asked me if they had gone bad and I said no. Why did you throw them out then? he retorted. Why did I throw them out? I think just because they were \"ends\". From that day on, I have used an entire tomato as long as no part of it was too bruised to eat. I also string fresh beans diligently to avoid just chopping off the ends and wasting some flesh and I roast Brussels sprouts whole to keep all the leaves intact, leaving guests to remove the hard ends themselves while eating. Eat the tops with the carrot and you won't just get your dose of beta carotene: carrot tops are a great source of chlorophyll that contain cleansing properties to purify the blood, lymph nodes and adrenal glands and in turn clear tumors from our bodies. See? There was always a good reason why Bugs Bunny ate the entire thing. Ingredients: 1 bunch of carrots, including the green tops, chopped 1/2 cup cooked rice 3 cups chicken stock or vegetable stock a few sprigs of thyme 1 small red onion, chopped 2 garlic cloves, crushed oil, salt, pepper 1. In a small saucepan, heat some oil and saute garlic until brown and onions until soft. Add the carrots and cook for about 5 minutes. Add the carrot tops with the thyme and cook until tops are wilted. Season with salt and pepper. 2. Add stock and let simmer, halfway covered, for up to 20 minutes or until carrots are tender. During the last 3 minutes, stir in cooked rice. Adjust taste with a few more sprinkles of salt and pepper.

La Tienda is my new favorite online store. When a package of cooking chorizo arrived in the mail last week, I knew I had to make a very hearty stew with it, I just didn't know with what. At Whole Foods, I debated if I should pay $13 for two duck confit legs. The current state of the economy won out and I picked up four chicken legs instead for less than $4. I splurged on a $7 ham shank though because I didn't want the good chorizo to be alone in the pot. While cooking, the entire apartment smelled really good. Sauteing the chorizo with the garlic and onions was my favorite part, right after uncovering the pot after two hours of braising time. It was delicious with rice for dinner and it will be delicious tomorrow with pasta for lunch. Ingredients: 1 ham shank 4 chicken legs 4 pieces of cooking chorizo, chopped 4 ribs of celery, chopped 4 carrots, peeled, chopped 4 small potatoes, peeled, chopped 1 large onion, chopped 2 cloves garlic, crushed 4 sprigs of thyme oil, salt, pepper 1. In a large Dutch oven, heat some oil and brown chicken legs on both sides. Remove them to a plate. Add a little bit more oil and brown the ham shank on all sides. Remove to the same plate. 2. In the same pot with the rendered fat, saute the garlic and the onions. Add the chorizo and the potatoes and cook until slightly browned. Stir in the celery and the carrots with the thyme. 3. Add back the chicken and the shank. Add enough water to submerge the meats and let simmer. Season with salt and pepper. In the meantime, preheat the oven 350º. When the oven is ready, transfer the pot, covered, inside and braise for up to 2 hours. Carefully remove the pot from the oven and uncover. Stir and serve with rice, pasta or crusty bread.

243 East 14th Street between Third and Second Avenues 212/253.7670 $222 for four, with drinks, with tip ♥ Oy, I'm putting Mr. Jones Yakitori on a Deathwatch. I don't know why anyone would open a yakitori restaurant a few blocks away from St. Marks Place where yakitori joints are a dime a dozen. I immediately looked around for the grill when I went in, but I only saw booths for group diners. Upon entering, you immediately realized it's that type of place. The decor reminded me of some of the worst Thai places in the city where mod is the predominant theme and the restaurant converts into a club come the weekend. I just know that I regret paying over $200 for a mediocre dinner for four. Good thing my companions, two of whom were Japanese, had a good sense of humor. The foie gras inside the meatballs were barely noticeable. The bowl of rice cooked in butter and truffle oil was, admittedly, an unnecessary selection but it was even more ridiculous that they charged $9 for it. The yakitori pieces that would have cost us $3 apiece elsewhere were $5, while a pair of chicken ones came in for $7. Everything added up quickly and we accumulated a pretty long list of small bites. If we brought our boys with us, they would have complained at how hungry they still were after all that expense. Heck, I wanted a slice of pizza on my way home! (If you know my relationship with pizza, you would know that that's saying a lot.) The waitstaff were pretty, and though they were attentive, none of them looked like they appreciated Japanese food. I wouldn't be asking them the difference between kobe and wagyu beef anytime soon. But then again, they might not be around even if I wanted to.

Anna and I shared our restaurant wish list with each other a few days before I was scheduled to fly to Chicago. I had told her that I was okay with ethnic and cheap with the exception of paying a visit to the city's West Town neighborhood to dine at Publican, which recently earned its 2009 James Beard nomination for outstanding chef and restaurant design. A chef friend, whom I met at the Spotted Pig's Fergus Henderson event last year, had texted me earlier in the week to let me know that one of the waiters he had befriended during a recent visit to Chicago had told him about Publican's latest efforts. I knew nothing of the restaurant because their Web site still wasn't up before I visited, but I was ready to be impressed. I told our waiter as much after we were seated next to the bar. It wasn't a private table per se because the restaurant is spacious with communal tables and lofty ceilings, but being next to the kitchen kind of gave it some cachet. I requested for bar seating at the time of my reservation, but I had no idea I was actually going to be able to face my dining companions and enjoy a group conversation. The funny thing is that I was psyched and prepared to eat all the offal offerings as soon as I glazed over the menu, but our waiter didn't hear half of our initial order. We knew it wasn't neglect on his part because we practically read the entire menu out loud to him. In the end, we got the right amount of food for four and I have to say that he narrowed everything down to showcase what Publican was trying to present. The tied Monterey Bay sardines were bony but rewarding to pick on because of the dressing that came with it: yogurt, raisins and pine nuts. I want to be on the Mediterranean the next time I eat something like that with a plate of the same yellowtail crudo sprinkled with orange peel. We ordered the spicy pork rinds just like everyone else in the restaurant. They were airy and light with just a subtle hint of smoked paprika on them. We also shared one of the best charcuterie plates I've had in a while: scrapple, duck and foie gras terrine, pork pie and chorizo served with assorted pickles, capers and mustards. (Don't get me started with wine bars calling a plate of just prosciutto \"charcuterie special\".) The Basque stew of salt cod, shrimp, octopus, clams and mussels did not skimp on the broth's flavor. I think we all felt bad that we had to share such a scrumptious bowl of goodness. A plate of sunchokes rounded out our meal with local Matilda Goose Island beers, a glass of rose and a glass of port. The homeyness and hospitality of Publican and its staff coupled with the company of good eaters and sharers made up for my missing the beef's heart. I'll definitely make the same trip again. Publican is at 837 on West Fulton Market in Chicago, Illinois. You need to call for reservations at 312/733.9555 especially now that it's on everyone's radar. Our table for four right next to the bar was the perfect spot. You can buy the pig prints from the Tate Modern and blow them up as large as they did.

Did you know that Chicago has the most Polish residents after Warsaw? Yeah, me neither. From the immigration of the 1890s called Za Chlebem, or For Bread, to the \"Solidarity\" wave of the 1980s, the Polish have called Chicago home for more than 150 years. So when I told Anna I was going to disturb her otherwise quiet work week by flying in to her city for three days to eat and kill time before I was scheduled to start a new job, Polish food was her first suggestion. I obviously wasn't escaping New York's cold weather by going to the midwest, so I thought a warm and comforting Eastern European fare was just perfect. I have no idea where I am when I sit on the passenger seat of a car, but I remember when Anna pointed to the gray DMV building next to the road she was driving on. The neighborhood itself looked like something from Winogrand's photo archives as if it was frozen in time; the leafless trees didn't make it less dreary. Smak Tak gave off the same feeling. It was empty when we walked in because the busy lunch hour just finished and it looked like a cabin that has never experienced business since it opened: it was spotless and lifeless. The food was the complete opposite. Even though Anna and I were the only two people eating, the kitchen still whipped up some dishes that were good and delicious enough for a big party. We started with a bowl of white borscht with a faint hint of dill. An assorted plate of pierogis came next with the savory (cheese and potato, sauerkraut and mushrooms, even tuna) and the sweet stuffings (syruped berries and cherries). I tried to slow down on the heavy dumplings because I wanted to save myself for the main attraction: good ol' hunter's stew of shredded cabbage, veal meat, potatoes and sausages. Winter food couldn't get any better than that. It was full of depth and flavor and it went down like a very warm fuzzy blanket. If I could cuddle with that bowl of stew, I would. If I had to hunt a big animal with all my strength, it was all I needed to do the job right. We came out of Smak Tak fortified and ready for Chicago's wind and chills and I was a little glad that lunch didn't come with any frills. Smak Tak is at 5961 North Elston Avenue in Chicago, Illinois. They are open seven days a week from 11 to 9. Related post/s: Smak Tak Polish restaurant photos on Flickr Charlie Trotter's knew a little something about making their diners feel comfortable

94 East 7th Street between First and Avenue A 212/982.4140 $130 for two, with drinks, with tip ♥ ♥ I'd like to think that kaiseki is Japan's answer to Spain's tapas if only a pincho is served in bejeweled bread held together by a hand-carved toothpick. The most basic types of food need to go a long way in a kaiseki meal, so presentation is key to make them more appealing. For the Japanese, it's an aesthetic experience. I remember my first meal at Morimoto where a selection of fine sashimi was served on a large porcelain square container. The tub was so ridiculously big that it took attention away from the fish. Sometimes, you only need the most humble utensil to appreciate a skillfully-executed dish, no? At Kyo-ya, however, the attention to both food and presentation are pretty much equal: both are of very high quality. A very simple mackerel roll was beautifully presented with edible flower petals, while the uni came on top of a miniature bale of hay. The fish was served on a small mat woven together with a soft piece of thread while a twig of what looked like mistletoe stuck out of the crushed ice. Even the wasabi was on onion-skin paper I've only seen used for truffles. The accessories seem unnecessary, but Kyo-ya makes them so delicately that they don't come off cheesy. Each order, even our very simple udon soup and plate of grilled sardines, came out looking like very special gifts. Related post/s: Morimoto was so long ago You know what was long ago? Naka Naka!

I saw a bunch of lacinato kale at the market and I immediately thought of the delicious salad I had at Lupa over the holiday season. At the time, I didn't know there were other kinds of kale because I've only seen the curly ones in Harlem. It turns out kale is classified by leaf type and lacinato is also known as black cabbage. It's crispier and can be eaten raw, where as the curly ones need to be cooked down or else the leaves are too tough to chew. The Lupa salad used guanciale, or unsmoked pig's cheeks. I made do with a slab of bacon sliced thinly because I didn't want to spend too much money after paying only $2.99 for the bunch of kale. The kale was also roasted but I left that out here to make the recipe even more simple. This might not be hefty to be its own course, but it sure was a good starter. Ingredients: 1 small bunch lacinato kale, washed, leaves torn from hard stalks, chiffonade 6 to 8 strips of bacon, chopped juice from 1 lemon 1. In a skillet, render some fat by frying the bacon. Cook until bacon pieces are brown and slightly crispy. Remove from pan using a slotted spoon. Set the fat aside. 2. Put the kale leaves in a big bowl and toss them with lemon juice using your hands. 3. To serve, put a handful of kale on each person's plate. Sprinkle with bacon and drizzle with some of the fat for extra moisture. Related post/s: Cook down kale and they're good with sundried tomatoes Kale as a dessert? You bet!

It's so nice to step out of the gym at 4:30pm and squint because it's so bright outside. We New Yorkers like our different seasons, but oh, nothing is as sweet as welcoming spring. I'm actually way ahead of the weather with this recipe because I think of fennel in a cold salad as a summer produce: bright and fresh. If you have a mandoline, you can make a better presentation with this salad, but a sharp knife will do as long as you use extra care especially with the celeriac. A very good Parmiggiano is necessary, although Piave cheese will do okay, too. Add to the salad's brightness by plucking a few flat parsley leaves from its stem and serving them whole. Ingredients: 1 fennel bulb, sliced thinly 1 celery root, peeled, sliced thinly 3 sprigs of parsley, leaves plucked from stem Parmiggiano Reggiano cheese juice from one lemon oil, salt, pepper 1. In a bowl, toss fennel and celery root with lemon juice and some salt. The lemon juice will keep the vegetables' color until you're ready to serve. Add parsley leaves and season with pepper. Drizzle a generous amount of good olive oil. 2. Before serving, slice some cheese and add to the salad. Related post/s: I totally copied this from Frankie's 457 in Brooklyn

231 West 40th Street between Seventh and Eighth 212/354.2195 $65 for two, with drinks, without tip ♥ ♥ Inakaya is a good place for two kinds of dates: one, an awkward first date when neither have to nervously talk but still have a good time; two, a long-term couple date when almost anything can slip by and forgiven by the end of the night. For the first couple, they can't really have a quiet conversation while dining at Inakaya because it's a robatayaki, also known as robata, or an open grill where every few minutes a chorus of waiters and chefs shout and repeat customers' orders. For the long-timers, they may be amused with the very lively setting and shrug off another date night out. The Dr. and I belong to the latter. We were to meet midtown for dinner to eat sushi, but we didn't want to spend too much money. I was at the new Muji store inside the New York Times building and noticed Inakaya next door. It was only a week old when we visited, but it was already packed with Japanese salarymen who perhaps wanted to support the establishment's efforts. There were a few families as well and the younger kids seemed to enjoy all the screaming. Some of them even participated in the mochi-making presentation by the window where a giant pestle is used to mush up the soy. The robatayaki's origin leads back to the city of Sendai in the northeast region of Japan. The chefs sit on their shins wearing ninja-like socks surrounded by carefully-selected fresh ingredients. At Inakaya, it's orchestrated how they kneel and reach out for the produce and they use the same fluid moves to serve the finished dishes. Long wooden paddles are used so that the chefs can reach you from across the grill while the rest of your order is served by kimono-wearing waiters. The food can't get any better for something across the Port Authority bus terminal. The oysters came from the west coast, and even though they lightly touched the grill, they still tasted like the ocean. The day's sashimi special came from Tsukiji Market that morning but I don't remember it being out of our budget. We unfortunately skipped the beautiful marbled meats that were displayed in front of us-we weren't in the mood for red meat-but we couldn't say no to the buttery uni. It's nice to know that there's a place to go to to escape the mediocrity of Hell's Kitchen and the awfulness of fast-food kingdom at Times Square. Now I know where to eat if I ever find myself at the bus station or the AMC movie theater next door even if it means putting up with a little bit more of noise.

The two-or-two rule I apply for squid also applies when I cook octopus. You either tenderize it for 2 minutes or two hours; anything other than those times, your octopus will be chewy and inedible. At the Filipino grocery store in Jersey City, I found a small frozen block of octopus for under $5. I wish I bought more because this Galician salad was so easy. It might take time to cook the octopus but once tender, it's like tossing a simple salad together. Ingredients: 1 octopus, about 2 pounds, thawed, beak removed if necessary 4 medium potatoes, peeled, sliced smoked paprika salt 1. Bring a large pot of water to a boil and add a generous helping of salt. Put octopus in water and, when it returns to boil, cover and lower the heat to simmer. Cook for no more than 2 hours, until octopus is tender. When you have 30 minutes to go, add the potatoes and cook until tender. 2. Remove octopus and potatoes from pot of water and drain. Slice the octopus into smaller pieces. Separate the potatoes on a platter and sprinkle with paprika. Distribute the octopus on top of the potatoes. Drizzle with olive oil and season with some salt.

I picked up a copy of Fuchsia Dunlop's Land of Plenty from the library last week. I skimmed through it before I checked it out because I wanted to see if the recipes were easy to do at home. I'm obsessed with this dry-fried string beans dish I always order when I'm eating at Grand Sichuan, so I made sure there was a similar string beans entry caled rou mo jiang dou. My mouth watered while reading the recipe and I knew I just had to do it pronto. Before heading out to Chicago earlier this week, I pickled the string beans. Emptying them out when I was ready to make a Friday lunch, I couldn't believe how fragrant it had gotten. The star anise and the ginger together gave the beans a most familiar smell: I knew I was on the right track. Thank you to Fuschia Dunlop's time in Chengdu! The recipes gave me an understanding of how much history came with each, but she's deciphered them to make it easy to replicate at home. Ingredients: 1 bunch of long green beans 1/4 lb ground pork 1/2 tsp rice wine 1/2 tsp light soy sauce 3 dried Thai chiles, snipped in half and some of the seeds discarded 1/2 tsp whole Sichuan peppercorns salt peanut oil for cooking For the pickling solution: 4 dried Thai chiles 1/2 tsp whole Sichuan peppercorns 2 tsps rice wine 1 star anise 1 tbsp brown sugar 1 large finger of ginger, peeled, chopped in smaller pieces 1 cinnamon stick salt 1. Pickle the string beans up to 3 days in advance. Wash the beans thoroughly and store in a pickling jar large enough to hold all the long beans. Meanwhile, boil about 3 cups of water with some salt until it dissolves. Add the rest of the ingredients and let simmer for 5 minutes, or until water has reduced to more or less 2 cups. Set aside and let cool. When pickling solution is cool enough, separate the solid ingredients and stuff them in the jar with the beans. Pour in pickling liquid to fill the jar; there should be enough water to submerge all of the beans. Close tightly and store in the fridge until ready to cook. 2. At time of cooking, mix ground pork with rice wine, soy sauce and salt in a large glass bowl. Set aside. 3. Remove beans from pickling solution and chop into small pieces to complement the small grains of the ground pork. You can pick the brown tips and throw those away. 4. Using a wok or a large frying pan, heat some peanut oil until almost smoking. Add the pork and stir-fry until dry and crispy. Transfer back to the same bowl. 5. Add a fresh coat of peanut oil to the pan and heat. Add chiles and peppercorns and stir-fry until fragrant. Be careful not to let them burn. Add the beans and stir-fry for 1 minute. Add the pork and stir-fry for another minute. Serve with a steaming bowl of white rice.

1 Main Street in DUMBO, Brooklyn 718/222.0666 $45 for two, with a drink, without tip ♥ ♥ We descended on the island of Brooklyn earlier than we would want to be, but Bubby's was already teeming with young families and baby strollers. We squeezed ourselves past the waiting crowd and told the maitre d' we would take the two empty seats at the bar. At Bubby's, the bar is the way to go if there's less than four of you so you avoid the long wait, but you also sacrifice service. At the bar, we ordered a bloody Mary and a diet Coke. We split the grass-fed burger and opted for a salad instead of fries and shared a side of two eggs over-easy and bacon. As soon as our plates were placed in front of us, it took more than ten minutes to start eating because we had to wait for our waiter to walk by so that we can remind him about the ketchup and mustard. I walked to the other end to find one of the two guys running the bar, but couldn't find them. When one of them came out of the kitchen, I couldn't get his attention until he returned to our side of the bar to hear the lady next to us complain about her eggs. (She ordered fried and got scrambled instead.) But when we finally started eating, it was a very pleasant burger, and not because we were extremely hungry but because it as juicy, perfectly medium-rare and well-seasoned. The salad was boring so we mixed in some of the egg yolks with it to give it a kick. In fact, forget about well-crafted salads when you go to Bubby's: order anything that's heartier and heavier than a bowl of freshly tossed vegetables and expect to wait.

Baked Red Snapper with Salmoriglio

***CONTENT
From the New York Times last week, I learned what salmoriglio is: an acidic and velvety sauce of Sicilian origin that's perfect for fish. I always use it; I just never knew it had an actual name! After running an errand for my friend Judy, I stopped by the Westside Market on Broadway and bought a whole red snapper to prepare for dinner. I've been watching the Bahamian fish competition on Discovery Channel and I've been craving grilled whole fish for days. But with snow on the ground and without a grill, I had to settle for baked fish safely cooked in the confines of the Dr.'s apartment. Ingredients: 1 whole red snapper, scaled, cleaned, pat dry with paper towels 2 sprigs rosemary 1 lemon, sliced 1 red onion, sliced 6 bay leaves 4 garlic cloves, peeled, minced oil, salt, pepper For the salmoriglio: leaves from 2 sprigs of thyme, stems reserved for fish 2 sprigs of parsley, chopped 1 tsp oregano powder 1 garlic cloves, minced zest and juice from 1 lemon oil, salt, pepper 1. In a bowl, mix the salmoriglio herbs and spices together. Drizzle some oil and add the lemon juice by whisking with a fork. Cover and refrigerate until ready to serve. 2. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 450º. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and brush with olive oil. 3. Scatter the half of the lemon slices and half of the onion on the baking sheet and top with the thyme stems, rosemary sprigs and bay leaves. Season the fish with salt and pepper and stuff with garlic cloves and place on top of the herbs. Drizzle the fish with olive oil. Place the remaining lemon and onion slices on top of the fish. Cover with foil and bake until the fish is cooked through, about 20 minutes. Serve the fish whole, with salmoriglio sauce on the side.

Searching for a Good Taco: Sunset Park, Brooklyn

Look what you did, Jase said as he pointed to the window. It was snowing even though the weather channel reported rain for the day. It wasn't taco-eating weather but we had work to do: we will find a good taco in Sunset Park, Brooklyn. Sunset Park, Brooklyn experienced its heyday during World War II when the Brooklyn Army Terminal employed more than 10,000 people to help ship to American troops. Like any other neighborhood, it reach its peak and lost its allure to families who wanted to move to the suburbs. All of a sudden, the rowhouses that would remind you of San Francisco were no longer valuable. By 1990, 50% of Sunset Park's population consisted of Puerto Ricans and Dominicans. Today, Brooklyn Chinatown is along Eighth Avenue, while Seventh is favored by Indians from Gujarat and Fifth Avenue by Mexicans. It was this detail that made me drag Jase to the main drag to search for a good taco. I had a small list and I gave the Jase my usual rules: a chorizo taco is a good start, but we'll order the weirdest thing they have available. Jase had his, too: No head, no tripe, no eyes, no ears. I nodded to say, Yeah, yeah, yeah, because I know I'll try my best to convince him to eat them anyway. Luckily for him, the trucks were nowhere to be found because it was the middle of the day and most of the hole-in-the-walls were covered with plywood. We ended up walking from 44th Street to 55th and ducking in each place that didn't look too fancy. 1. Tacos Nuevos Mexico III, 44-10 Fifth Avenue, 718/686.8151 Where was I and II? This was the first place we spotted as soon as we turned the corner on Fifth Avenue. It was past noon and we were famished. Upon confirmation that they were open for business-no one was inside and the kitchen looked sparkly clean-we sat down and ordered one carnitas taco and one chorizo. Two of each came and all four were slathered with wet guacamole. I like avocados; I just don't like them in my tacos because they end up hiding the flavor of the meat. I realized I hadn't done this taco search in a while that I forgot to let the waitress know that guacamole and sour cream were no-nos. In any case, the carnitas were very soft and fatty, while the chorizo was salty and spicy. We devoured them with Diet Cokes and we were very satisfied with everything, guac and all. 2. Tacos Xochimilco, 45-01 Fifth Avenue, 718/435.7600 The lengua, or beef tongue, at Xochimilco tasted like it had been cooking for hours. It was sweet and it fell apart at each prod of a plastic fork. The tripe was surprisingly delicious. I am used to having them a little chewy with its natural offal taste included, but this one was just right. Jase ended up liking the tongue, too: Like Mom's Sunday pot roast. 3. La Guera, 46-03 Fifth Avenue, 718/437.0232 La Guera had the cheapest of all the tacos we tasted. A small one cost us $1.25 when we thought the $1.50 at Xochimilco was already a good deal. But you get what you pay for: the pastor taco tasted too earthy here; a little bit dry, with only a small chunk of pineapple and a spritz of lime juice to save it. The buche, one of my favorite types of taco, or the stomach, was just a load of flavorless fat. 4. Tacos California, 46-16 Fifth Avenue, 718/439.1661 I usually avoid restaurants that bill itself as \"authentic\" but we were getting full and the snow had turned to steady rain. We needed to stay dry and warm, so we went in here to take a break while a Mexican soap opera blasted overhead. We ordered a taco that was called an enchilada with \"spicy pork\" in parentheses. From my understanding of fast foods, enchilada is a bigger tortilla stuffed with anything as long as tomato sauce is involved. I was right, but it was awkward to eat because it was half the expected size. Notes of paprika and cumin were included, two of my favorites spices, but the tomato definitely tasted like it came from a can. Jase refused to try the cabeza, or the head, which was too bad because it was the restaurant's saving grace. It was fatty and gelatinous and full of flavor-my lips were coated in natural fat soon after. 5. Tulcingo, 55-20, Fifth Avenue, 718/439.2896 By the time we entered Tulcingo, Jase and I were giving up. I felt defeated after just six tacos, but alas, good things must come to an end. Every place we went to had orejas, or ears, on the menu, but only Tulcingo actually had them. The last time Jase and I had pigs' ears, they were fried, and he wished these were, too, instead of just boiled to death. But I did like the crunchy cartilage even if the skin felt more like Jell-O in my mouth. The chorizo here was mediocre, though I liked how it was spicier than the first one we had. All in all, we had some good tacos but nothing that blew me away. We split one Negro Modelo to end our late lunch date and toasted to our rainy Mexican day in Sunset Park, Brooklyn. Looks like it's time to take a trip out west to satisfy my taco craving this year.

Chicken Tinola, Filipino Chicken Ginger Soup

Tinola, or Filipino chicken ginger soup, is one dish that I don't make often. When I was growing up in Manila in the, ahem, 80s, my father brought the farm from his hometown of Ilocos Sur with him. We had a backyard with a small fish pond and a chicken coop. Each week, we would either have paksiw, or fish soup with ginger, or tinola. Every Sunday, our family lunch consisted of a freshly-slaughtered chicken, all innards included, in a big pot of steaming soup. Traditionally, tinola uses green papaya and the leaves from a Thai chili plant. For the sake of making it easier here in New York, I use chayote, which is readily available in Harlem, and watercress, which is plentiful in Chinatown. I've given you a recipe that calls for fish sauce, but salt will do just fine especially if your mother is allergic to fish. You can also use spinach salad leaves instead of watercress. We still stay in that house whenever we go back to the motherland, but it has changed so much I can't imagine that it used to have a guava tree and a large mango trunk out back, too. Twenty or so years later, the spirit that comes with eating tinola with the family is still there, no matter what vegetable I substitute. Ingredients: 4 pieces of chicken back, some with skin on 2 finger-size gingers, peeled, sliced 3 chayotes, peeled, seeded, cubed 2 bunches watercress 1 small onion, sliced 2 garlic cloves, minced fish sauce oil 1. In a large Dutch oven, heat some oil. Brown chicken pieces, about 4 minutes per side. Remove from pot and set aside. 2. In the same pot, add a little more oil. Saute garlic until light brown, ginger until fragrant and onions until soft. Add the chicken pieces back and add a few jiggers of fish sauce. Cook for 3 minutes or enough for the chicken to absorb the fish sauce essence. 3. Add 3 cups of water with the chayote and simmer, covered, for 25 minutes, or until chicken is cooked and chayotes are tender. Season with a few more jiggers of fish sauce. The broth should be gingery with a little bit of saltiness to it. Turn off the heat when done and submerge the watercress. The remaining heat should be enough to cook the watercress.

Thankfully, it's not all steaks in Buenos Aires. With some perseverance-as in, walking from San Telmo down Microcentro on the way to Recoleta-you can find a small restaurant tucked away from the busy streets. I wanted to experience the action of the city during the day but this proved sort of eh especially when you come from New York City. My companions were already starting to whine because we had been walking for at least two hours. I insisted on Restó for lunch after reading about its use of fresh ingredients in my trusty Knopf map guide and I kept telling them that all the walking will be worth it. My reputation was at stake. Restó better be better than good. We finally found it behind the Central Society of Architects storefront an hour and a half before they were about to close for the rest of the afternoon. We felt like we've been in the jungle as soon as we walked in. The restaurant was a haven of cool air and quietness; we were sweaty and hungry. But all of us lit up as soon as we perused the menu: Rabbit! Quail! Fresh basil! Watermelon! We've been in Buenos Aires for two days and we've never seen watermelon on the street. And a menu without steak? Que horor! But a most welcomed change for our stomachs. I found out later that chef-owner Maria Barrutia trained under Ferran Adriá. I swear that tidbit wasn't mentioned in my guide book. Restó and I were meant to be! The menu changes almost daily, depending on what's fresh in the market, and everything is cooked with so much skill and care that we couldn't help but elicit an mmmm after every bite. The tomatoes were plump and bursting with flavor. The onions were sweet so they weren't just a side; they were part of a whole dish. At Restó, I was thankful for the rock salt, freshly-ground pepper and the chive blossoms on my butter-attention to such detail make me appreciate those who work in the kitchen. (Note that most Buenos Aires tables leave their steaks unsalted and you're left with table salt and pepper.) You've just gotta trust me on this one. Rabbit terrine: Stuffed quail: Restó is on Montevideo 938 in the El Centro neighborhood. Lunch is a very good deal. Dinner requires reservations, so call them at 11/4816-6711.

M & I International Foods is the place to go to for Russian imports and other Eastern European produce here in New York City. \"Brighton Beach\" came from a naming contest that reminded the developers of a beach resort in Brighton, England. In the 1950s, the neighborhood welcomed its first settlers of second-generation Americans from Holocaust survivors. Twenty years later, refugees from the former Soviet Union started calling it their own Little Odessa. After the long subway ride from the upper west side, we finally reached the Brighton Beach stop on the Q. The weather was damp and gray, but I couldn't imagine a more perfect setting to stay in one place and eat. And then I realized I didn't bring my camera! Ack! Good thing Cameron brought hers and it saved the day. Pickles and Slaws: I love a good slaw. Take away the mayonnaise and I'll eat crunchy cabbage with bite. I also couldn't get enough of their cucumber pickles. I ended up taking home two pints and they were all gone three days later. Fish: I love me some herring, but for the sake of pacing ourselves and trying something new(ish), I opted for the trout, the sturgeon and the sardines instead. The trout was smoked and naturally sweet; the sturgeon salted and dried; the sardines icky and fishy. We pulled the guts out and I just couldn't finish eating it. Somehow, it was very different from a refined slice atop sticky rice and some nori. Fat and Meats: I've looked forward to the Russian lardo ever since I watched the Andrew Zimmern episode about New York City. Because everyone behind the counter at M & I only speaks English when prodded, I found it painful to ask the surly old lady to slice it for me like prosciutto. Our plastic utensils didn't help slice through the large chunk of fat when we tried to consume it at the store, but it was so lovely when I got home! One swipe of my Global knife and the Dr. and I were picking at it and drinking it with a bold red wine. It's still in the fridge, but we've been doing damage ever since. The smoked belly was one of the prettiest things I saw at the store. I mean, just check out the mustard seeds on it! As expected, each small bite was soft and fatty, but very succulent and sweet. Probably the best thing we ate all day was the pressed beef tongue. You'll devour it as fast as we did if you could just get past the gristly look of it. Don't let the appearance fool you, though. The texture is smooth and jelly-like and each slice goes down like a well-cooked piece of beef. Warm Food: Upstairs in the small cafe, we pointed at a few pieces to try: baba ghanoush, bell peppers and eggplants, cabbage leaves stuffed with pork, potato lattkes stuffed with chicken and mushrooms. There were plenty of freshly-baked breads, phyllo-wrapped everything and interesting-looking pastries made of honey, almonds and apricots. I even drank a coriander soda that tasted like a watered-down Robitussin. (No, that wasn't good.) Four hours later, we've gone up and down the three-level grocery and deli store and have sampled all kinds of familiar and not-so-familiar delicacies from very far away places. All we had to do was take the subway. M & I International Foods is at 249 Brighton Beach Avenue in Brighton Beach, Brooklyn.

240 Ninth Avenue between 24th and 25th Streets 212/242.4730 $230 for four, with a bottle of wine, with tip ♥ ♥ ♥ I will always be impressed when someone can make something out of almost nothing. When that something is different than usual, I'm even more in awe of the skill that comes with that thought in the first place. At Txikito, there are some skillful people in the kitchen. Take my silverfish salad. Silverfish is easy to find in Chinatown; and cheap, too. At Txikito, they toss them in a light batter, fry to make them crunchy and serve them atop a bowl of wild arugula leaves. Then there are the leeks; poached and then drizzled in vinaigrette and sprinkled with chopped boiled egg. The dish is similar to one of Blue Ribbon's signature dishes and it worked just fine on our table full of pork. My ultimate favorite \"cheap\" dish was the beef tongue, made crispy and served with mustard and cornichons. I relished the fact that the other two people at our table ate them-and liked them-because they had no idea what they were eating. And then there are the dishes that take a lot of preparation and warrant the price on the menu. I've eaten octopus carpaccio a few times before, but the Txikito version is one of the best ones. Perhaps tenderized by slapping each piece against a chopping board (a la Jewel Bako) and then drizzled with oil, lemon juice, marjoram and some chili, it was tender and crunchy at the same time: a texture that might be weird to some, but really good to me. The suckling pig special was the most expensive on our bill at $30, but it was succulent and tasty; the meat melting off the bones and all the fat dripping down the crispy skin-pure heaven. The blistered serrano peppers were hotter in the end than I would have liked; the Catalan version I savored in Barcelona was much sweeter. The crab meat gratin was tasty but unexciting. The blood sausage was wrapped in crispy egg-roll skin; it killed me to pay $8 for them. The small sandwiches of unsmoked bacon seemed out of place with the dinner items, but I liked the finger-food presentation. Our waitress was very patient and brought out everything in perfect timing and order. One of us never experienced Spanish pintxos before, so I watched the waitress patiently explain the food choices to him. We selected a lot of meat, but she made sure the seafood and vegetables came in between. On a busy Saturday night, they let us stay until 11:30pm even though we were one of the last tables around. As we exited the restaurant, our inexperienced friend said, That has got to be one of the best dinners I've had in a long time. Txikito is good for that, but also excellent for someone like me.

Crispy Pigs' Ears Salad

***CONTENT
I've made pigs' ears salad at home before, but this version is crispier, saltier and more perfect with beer. This is for my friend, Hafeez, who liked the Irving Mill version a lot when we ate there. At home, I fried the ears in really hot oil while standing on a short step-ladder. I wanted to be as far away from the skillet as much as possible, but I also wanted to see how the ears were cooking. It must have been a sight because my father stayed to watch me avoid getting splattered by very hot oil. After you've fried the first batch of pigs' ears, you want them to stay crispy while you finish the rest. Don't cover the skillet when frying because that will trap moisture in. I used a slotted spoon to remove the fried ears and I transferred them to a stainless steel colander to drain the excess oil. You don't want to use paper towels like usual because the ears will end up sitting on moist paper while you finish cooking. You can use almost any bitter greens for this salad to stand up to the salty fried pigs' ears. I used spinach, but spicy arugula, endive or radicchio are great substitutes. Ingredients: 4 pigs' ears, thoroughly washed 1 bunch of spinach 1 red onion, thinly sliced half a bunch of parsley, finely chopped oil, salt, pepper 1. In a large stock pot, cook pigs' ears in enough boiling water to submerge them for an hour and a half. When cooked, remove and slice in strips. 2. Heat enough frying oil in a large skillet to deep-fry sliced ears. In small batches, add pigs' ears and fry for 6 minutes. Do not cover skillet. When fried, use a slotted spoon to remove ears from hot oil and into a colander to drain excess oil. Sprinkle with salt and pepper while fried ears are hot. Set aside to cool. 3. Assemble salad when ears are almost cool enough to eat. Toss ears with remaining ingredients in a large salad bowl. Season with pepper.

Where to eat in Buenos Aires, Argentina: La Cabrera

The mostly American crowd waiting outside made me question the reviews I read before coming, but it was our last night together with G. and he really wanted to share our last meal at La Cabrera. Not that there's anything wrong with that; I was just wondering where the locals were. It was a warm but cool night. Even when some people in the crowd got demanding-we witnessed someone hand a AR$20 bill-the maitre d' kept her cool and distributed cold glasses of champagne and small bites of hot sausages to everyone waiting outside. We jumped off our seats when, an hour and a half later, she called the Dr.'s name. We were still seated before the $20-guy and his pouting girlfriend. Fellow German tourists said it best when we talked about the food we've been eating in Argentina: There are two flavors in this country: dulce de leche and unsalted beef. Because the country is considered to have the best beef in the world, no seasoning is ever added to all the cuts you order. This is, of course, okay if the beef is not overcooked; but the problem in a country of parillas, or grills, is that the meat hangs and cooks by the fire for hours at a time, resulting in the driest and blandest meat I've also tasted in my life. When the meat comes out this way, I need all the salt I can get. At La Cabrera, they're smart enough to cater to the particular tourist who might like their meat medium-rare even if it's not the traditional way of cooking in Argentina. We ordered a medium-rare cut of rib-eye steak and it came out, well, perfectly. We knew not to order two steaks for the three of us, but we did order the sausage to complete our meal. An array of gravy and sauces came with our order and our waiter was nice enough to let us know we wouldn't be needing any more food. The service is brisk because they are very busy, but our waiter was attentive enough to take group photos for the table behind us and entertain my request to get a copy of the pig diagram hanging on the wall. (His answer? No, it's not for sale.) Anyone who has researched places to eat in Buenos Aires has surely come across La Cabrera. It's highly reputed and it is indeed the place where I got the perfect steak in Argentina-and that was after two weeks of eating a lot of beef. La Cabrera is on Cabrera 5099 in the Palermo Viejo neighborhood. There is another one across the big street next to Casa Blanca. Look for the crowd waiting outside at both places.

I miss my routine of going to work, heading to the gym after and then meeting up with friends for food and drinks before the night ends, but I can't say it has been all bad while I've been unemployed. Sure my savings account is dwindling, but I've also started to cherish the days when I can catch up with reruns of Bizaare Food, The Real Housewives of Orange County and The Bachelor. The best days have been those quiet afternoons where I can make myself a meal and then head over to a museum and enjoy the space without the crowd. This is one of the meals I made myself last week. You can roast the beets a day or two ahead. After peeling, transfer the whole beets in a bowl, cover with plastic wrap and store in the fridge until ready to use. Poaching the egg is the most challenging but really easy. Once you try it, I swear you'll add a poached egg to every salad you make. Ingredients: 2 red beets and 2 golden beets, tops cut off 1 endive, sliced 2 ribs celery, chopped 4 leaves of green lettuce, chiffonade 1 egg 1/4 cup of vinegar oil, salt, pepper 1. Wrap beets in aluminum foil and roast in the oven for about 1 hour or until you can prick each beet with a fork without too much effort. Remove from the oven and set aside. When cool enough to handle, peel using a paring knife or a peeler and then chop in small wedges. 2. Poach the egg when ready to assemble the salad. Fill a deep skillet with 2 cups of water. Add vinegar and a pinch of salt and place over high heat. Crack egg into small shallow bowl. When water boils, reduce heat to a rolling boil and gently pour in the egg. Cook until whites are firmly set. Remove egg with a slotted spoon and set aside on a plate. Keep it on the slotted spoon until ready to serve. 3. Assemble the salad. In a large bowl, combine all vegetables with roasted beets. Season with salt and pepper. Drizzle with olive oil and toss until well-combined. Serve salad on a plate with poached egg by carefully placing it on top. Related post/s: I've come a long way since I poached my first egg

How to get rid of one of the most awful wines I've received as a gift? Okay, to be fair, it was from one of those exchange gift things last Christmas when no one really knew who's getting which. But two bottles of wine seemed like a good deal to me, so I picked them up and never let go until everyone had claimed one of their own. Unfortunately, it was like drinking liquid jam. One sip later, I knew the rest was going to be used for cooking. At Fairway, I found a large turkey leg for $3.50. I never really deal with turkey unless it's November, but I couldn't really spend any more than what the bad wine was worth. I picked up one package and had the butcher chop it in three smaller pieces. I threw in a pound of green beans, also on sale for $1.99, and the remaining bacon from the fridge. Talk about cooking for less, but good. Top this with a fried egg and you're good to go. Ingredients: 1 turkey leg, chopped in thirds 1 pound green beans, stringed, chopped in half 2 cups of wine 2 slices of bacon, chopped 3 cloves of garlic, minced 1 red onion, chopped 2 tbsps hot paprika half a bunch of parsley, roughly chopped oil, salt, pepper 1. In a large Dutch oven, cook bacon to render some fat. Remove browned bacon and set aside. Using the rendered fat, brown turkey legs, about 5 minutes each side. Remove from pot and set aside. 2. In the same pot, add some extra oil. Saute garlic until light brown and onions until soft. Add green beans with paprika and toss to cook for about 5 minutes. Add back bacon and turkey leg pieces. Season with salt and pepper. Add wine and simmer, uncovered, for 5 minutes. 3. Add 2 cups of water to the pot and continue to simmer, covered, for 45 minutes. Toss in parsley, mix to combine well, and turn off the heat and serve. Related post/s: I cook more duck than turkey I really do

72 Hudson Avenue between Front and Water Streets, near DUMBO Brooklyn 718/522.1018 $40 each for a group of 5, with drinks and tip ♥ ♥ If you're tired of the lumberjack look because you've seen enough of the same style at Freemans, Hearth and even the J. Crew Men's Shop in TriBeCa, you're better off going elsewhere. If you like plaid shirts and facial hair, plus a more accommodating service than any of those hipster places in Manhattan, Vinegar Hill House is just your place. (The couple who owns the restaurant met on the job at Freemans.) In a week's time between my two visits, the vibe in Vinegar Hill House changed dramatically: it was the booze. The restaurant was a little more somber and comforting before they got their liquor license, but now with the hot toddies going around, the buzz is louder and, well, more intoxicating. A lot has been said about the chicken at Vinegar Hill House and all the good things about it are true: it's moist and liberally seasoned. But it is still just chicken, and at $16, it should be moist and well-seasoned. The Brussels sprouts were softer during my second visit and I wondered if they were baked that time around instead of roasted. The delicate squares of ravioli were just that, and the pork and trout dishes were without frills. All together, they made a nice meal even if everything is streamlined and very simple, capped with a slice of not-so-Guinness chocolate cake. I do like a little adventure on my menu and nothing gets me more excited than something out of the box when it comes to classic dishes. I know Jean Adamson is a capable chef, so I wouldn't be surprised if she brings out the guns as more and more seasonal ingredients come out in the spring. Perhaps it's to keep Manhattanites away; and in this day and age of too many plaid shirts, that's just fine with me. Related post/s: Freemans is now easier to find Hearth has a better wine list

I ended up doubling the ingredients here to fill a silicone mold and a 4×8-inch loaf pan. The good thing is that you don't need a mixer; just a strong arm and a wooden spoon. Keep the measurements precise and I promise it will be the best banana bread you'll ever bake. I filled the silicone molds more than halfway and the cooked banana bread puffed up, making their own muffin-like tops. I sliced the tops off and I had these cool-looking banana bread bars. Because I baked late in the afternoon, I could only distribute the tops to save the end-products for the next day's photo shoot and that reminded me of one of my favorite Seinfeld episodes. Ingredients: 4 ripe bananas, smashed 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 1/3 cup butter, melted in microwave; some more to butter the loaf pan 3/4 cup sugar 1 egg, beaten 1 tsp vanilla 1 tsp baking soda a pinch of salt 1. Preheat the oven to 350ºF. With a wooden spoon, mix butter into the mashed bananas in a large mixing bowl. Add the sugar, egg and vanilla. Toss in the baking soda and salt. Keep mixing. Lastly, add the flour and continue to mix until well-combined. 2. Pour mixture into a buttered 4×8-inch loaf pan. Place the loaf pan on a baking sheet and transfer in the oven and bake for 1 hour. Cool completely on a rack before slicing to serve. Related post/s: JB Prince has all the silicone molds you'll ever need My first time baking something fancy

Here's another Italian recipe I butchered. Cioppino is a traditional Italian stew using the catch of the day and I used all the seafood I \"caught\" from the sea-permarket (ha!) except for fish because my mother is allergic; otherwise I would choose monkfish fillets to have something very meaty and tender. The clams and mussels are perfectly cooked here, but that also means they didn't get enough time in the hot broth, so I think clam juice in a can is an absolute necessity. If your eaters are not fussy, using shrimp with their heads on can add more natural flavor to the soup. I also decided to skip the pasta in my version and opted to serve it with a few slices of toasted baguette. Ingredients: 1 lb squid, cleaned, sliced in small rings 1/2 lb shrimp, heads on, sprinkled with salt and pepper 12 littleneck clams 12 mussels, bearded 1 cup white wine 1 medium can of crushed tomatoes 1 small can of clam juice a handful of parsley, roughly chopped a few pieces basil leaves, chiffonade 6 cloves garlic, minced 1 tbsp white sugar 1 tsp red pepper flakes salt, pepper, oil 1 small baguette, sliced, toasted 1. In a large Dutch oven, heat some oil. Cook the shrimp for 3 minutes. Remove to a large bowl. 2. In the same pot, saute garlic with red pepper flakes until golden brown. Add white wine and 1/2 cup of water. Simmer in low fire. 3. Add clams and cover. Simmer for 3 minutes. Clams are cooked when they are open. Discard those that didn't open. Remove to a large bowl. Add mussels to the pot and cover. Simmer for 5 minutes. Mussels are also cooked when they are open. Discard those that didn't. Remove to the same bowl with the clams. 4. Add clam juice, tomatoes and 3 cups of water to the pot with all the seafood and wine flavor. Let simmer for about 20 minutes while occasionally stirring. Add squid and cook for 2 minutes. Add back the shrimp, clams and mussels and carefully toss together with the tomato broth. Remove from heat. The squid will finish cooking in the remaining heat. Ladle in big open bowls and serve with toasted baguette. Related post/s: Moules marinieres recipe Cockles in white wine sauce recipe

The best cioppino I've ever had was at Tadich Grill, a SF landmark (and, perhaps, a tourist trap). Still, the cioppino was loaded with fresh fish and shellfish and the broth fragrant and tasty enough to stand on its own.

I haven't been in the mood to cook even though I've been spending a lot of time at home. But while inside the Grand Central Terminal Market earlier, I was inspired to go back to the kitchen after I saw a small container of really fragrant dried porcini mushrooms on sale for $3.50. I turned to soup-making after assessing the contents of the cupboard, and whadayaknow, I had a porcini-flavored dried salami in stock: I chopped a few small slivers and used them as extra topping to this very earthy broth. Ingredients: 1/4 lb dried porcini mushrooms half a bundle of somen noodles 3 small potatoes, cubed 1 red onion, sliced 3 cloves of garlic, minced 2 sprigs of rosemary, finely chopped 2 sprigs of thyme a small knob of Piave cheese salt, oil 1. Soak dried porcini mushrooms in 2 cups of lukewarm water for about 20 minutes, or until they are soft. Drain and save the water. Roughly chop soaked mushrooms and set aside. 2. In a large Dutch oven, heat some oil. Saute garlic until brown and onions until soft. Add potatoes, rosemary and thyme and cook until potatoes are browning. 3. Add the mushrooms and the mushroom-flavored water and simmer for 10 minutes. Add 2 to 3 more cups of water, depending on how much broth you want. Season liberally with salt because the broth will be bland, but the salt will bring out the mushroom's earthy flavor. Keep in low simmer until potatoes are cooked and all the flavors are incorporated. 4. Throw in somen and stir for 3 minutes; this will quickly cook the noodles. Turn off heat and let remaining warmth finish cooking the noodles. Ladle in bowls and shave cheese on top before serving. Related post/s: Here's another soup recipe using somen noodles

211 East 43rd Street off Third Avenue 212/557.8200 about $80 for two people, with sake, with tip ♥ ♥ ♥ I don't need any horoscope to tell me that I've been living a lifestyle I can't afford, but it was right there on OK! Magazine, a copy I picked up after someone left it in the subway. I have been mooching off the Dr. the last couple of weeks, what with my unemployment insurance delayed and all, and feeling bad that he's been spending for two. Last week, he wanted to eat soup and he invited me to come with him. How could I say no? We sat at the bar and watched the place fill up. The kitchen in front of us went up in smokes whenever the guys grilled some yakitoris. We started with a few: bacon-wrapped asparagus, chicken knee bones (mmm, soft cartilage), some very livery riba and a plate of charred green peppers. A small bottle of a super dry sake helped us washed everything down. But what we really came for is Soba Totto's soba. I had the duck, kamo nanban, while the Dr. tried the mushroom. They were so different from each other: his broth had a subtle but earthy taste and mine was straight-up rich in flavor. The noodles easily gave, the duck melted in my mouth and the mushrooms provided some texture. Neither needed extra condiments-they were perfect the way they were served. Our bowls didn't look like much, but sometimes soba is all you need even if someone else offers to pick up the tab. Related post/s: Soba Totto photos on Flickr Aburiya Kinnosuke is around the block

It was like my personal heaven walking in JB Prince, the service and bakeware store on 31st Street between Madison and Park Avenues. It's been on my list to stop by but I have been unable to until this week because they're only open on weekdays from 9 to 5. Their Web site sucks so I didn't expect much from the store, but it was immaculate when I walked in. I touched everything I could touch, especially the Fat Duck and the El Bulli books. The sous vide machines were all lined up in a row and baking sheets and pans of all sizes hanged by clips. Just seeing the individual serving pieces made of plastic and bamboo made me want to throw a huge amuse-bouche party. It's amazing what I get to do while unemployed. There are so many errands, I don't know how they got done when I had a job. The past week alone, I ran all over the city finishing all sorts of businesses while also going to job interviews, seeing people I haven't seen in a while and watching movies in the middle of the afternoon. If I didn't have financial responsibilities, I swear I'd be enjoying this time more so than I did eight years ago when the Web first broke my heart. Heck, I'd be in Singapore with my brother and his wife, blowing through my savings and traveling all over Asia. Fuck, I hate being an adult! But back to reality: I wanted to check another thing off my Things-To-Do list which is to start experimenting with baked goods. (You understand that I didn't say \"baking\", right? Because I'm a little bit of a pussy and I'm afraid of commitments.) I received a nice, hefty birthday gift certificate from a few friends and, though I already know it will go towards the Kitchen Aid Pro with sausage, pasta and ice cream maker attachments, I'm saving it until I'm ready to use it like a pro. Financiers came to mind after scouring through my many cookbooks and realizing that it's one of those basic French recipes that don't require the use of an equipment. But because I'm also precise, I splurged on a $15 financier silicone mold-which explains the trip to JB Prince. I tried different flavors for my first batch of batter. I divided it into three small bowls and in one, I mixed in a tsp of ground coffee. In another, I added orange zest; I added finely chopped dried cranberries to the last batch. (Add your own flavor in Step 3 below.) After baking my first-ever financiers, I let them cool completely so as not to bother them in their molds until they were set. When I revisited them, they were basically popping themselves out of the molds and I didn't have to turn them over. I have to say that my favorite were the ones with orange zest. This recipe makes twenty two-inch financiers in one mold tray. Ingredients: a handful of raw almonds 1/4 cup white sugar 1/4 cup of flour, sifted 2 egg whites 1/3 cup of butter zest from a small orange another small knob of butter to coat the molds, melted in the microwave for a few seconds 1. Preheat oven at 360º. Meanwhile, make your almond meal. In a food processor, process almonds until powdery. It's okay that's it's grainy. 2. Make your beurre noisette. In a saucepan, melt the butter over low fire. Bring to a simmer and cook for 2 minutes, or until light brown and nutty-smelling. Set aside. 3. In a medium glass bowl, combine sugar and almond meal. Fold in the egg whites and mix well with a fork. Add the melted butter and continue to mix together. Stir in the flour and the orange zest and make sure everything is well-combined. 4. Butter your financier molds using a pastry brush. Pour the batter in each mold, filling it up just to the brim. Place batter-filled mold on a baking sheet. Bake for 18 minutes. Your financiers will puff up a bit and will get slightly crusty and golden on the edges, but soft on top. Remove from the oven and cool completely before turning them over on parchment paper.

Day 4: Trekking on Glacier Perito Moreno

***CONTENT
We took the bus back to El Calafate yesterday and said our good-byes to Monte Fitz Roy (Fitzie), Cerro Torre and the whole of El Chalten. Being in a bigger and busier town has its pluses, but walking along the main drag with all the amenities brought me closer to home and reminded me that we're halfway through our two-week vacation. For the first time in almost a week though, we finally saw the sun set. Here in Patagonia, the sun sets at around 11pm and we've missed the last few because we would be indoors, inebriated from too much red wine and comatose from the day's hike. (Cue in song, With a Little Help From My Friends...) I fall in and out of sleep while on the bus to Perito Moreno Glacier, only to wake up with the same view around me: big mountain in front, water on the left, forest on the right; but no ice. It's been more than an hour and I just can't wait to get out of the bus and stand up. At the park's entrance, a guide goes around with a small ticket machine charging us $60 Argentinian (about US$20) to enter. A few on the bus only had to say, Nacional, and they get a citizen's discount at $20 Argentinian. This is the first time my group is charged for any sort of activity in Patagonia and all eyes are on me to make sure the fee is worth it. Back in New York, I've signed everybody up to do a mini-trek on Perito Moreno instead of just a bus ride to view the giant glacier from the balcony. It cost each of us US$100, which we all consider steep since we're not the kind of travelers who pay for organized tour groups. But there is no such thing as shopping for a tour guide to do the mini-trek. Hielo Adventura has the monopoly to ferry tourists across the lake, suit them up with crampons and lead them on the glacier for an hour and a half before sending them back to their hotels. I later appreciate this because I couldn't imagine hoards of people on the glacier trekking everywhere if one outfit didn't control the number of visits to the top. So what is a glacier? It's technically a big mass of ice with two zones: accumulation and percolation. It's constantly snowing in the accumulation zone while the ice is melting in the percolation zone. The ice moves down the slope from where they are situated and ends in lakes or cliffs and forms terminal moraines, or stones and dirt pushed by the glacier. Named after the Argentinian explorer Francisco Pascacio Moreno, the glacier is popular because it's one of the few that can be accessed as simply and easily as this. While most glaciers are in very high altitudes and extreme temperatures, Perito Moreno is only 50 miles from El Calafate and only 279 feet above sea level. Since 1917, the glacier has been stable: its surface, width and length have remained the same because the snow increase in the accumulation zone is enough to compensate for whatever's melting in the percolation zone. Moreno acted as the expert-that's why he was called perito-when the Patagonian border was being disputed between Argentina and Chile and donated the land for the first Argentinian National Park, but he never saw the glacier that was named after him. We spend about twenty minutes ooh- and aah-ing at the glacier. It really is amazing how massive and far out it goes. The wind is steady and it's warm enough to stay at the balcony with cameras in hand, waiting for a small piece to crack and fall into the river. (It's probably one of the few places where you can hear people beg for the glacier to start cracking.) Whenever there is a crack-and it happens every few minutes-there is a thunderous noise, followed by a loud snap, like a gunshot, when the ice falls into the river. No matter how small, the fallen ice creates a ripple and another loud whoosh occurs. Everyone is on high alert when this happens because they want to capture the action on film, but most of the time, the crack happens somewhere we can't see. There is always a cheer from people who catch the exact moment and it's funny how automatic the reaction from the crowd gets after a few minutes. Two hours later, we board the bus to the pier and then the ferry across Rico Arm. From the boat, we can see the glacier's front walls and some iceberg channels. Everything is of that blue-ice color. (Oh, why? Snow and ice is white, but when sunlight goes through a glacier's solid ice crystals, it gets broken down into different colors. Blue light has enough extra energy to get away from the crystals without getting absorbed by the thick ice, so we see that blue that \"escapes\".) On the other side, we hike through a forest and see the contrast of the earth against the blue ice. It's like walking into some kind of video game: dry land here, water in the middle, ice over there. All you have to do is hop over and you're in a completely different landscape. One of the guides, after hearing that I'm from New York City, tells me that one of the most important movies shot in the city is also his favorite movie of all-time: Madagascar. I laugh, join in the joke and tell him that the penguins are probably still up to no good. The Dr. remains stoic because he never saw the movie. We put our crampons on. We see several groups of twenty ahead of us. The guides smartly separate all of us in a timely manner so that we all enjoy the glacier at our own group time. It's never crowded while we trek and we never come across the other folks. We trek in one line and follow our guide, hunching forward when walking and leaning back when descending. I love the sound of crushing ice and I over-react and march with my knees up to get more of it. I take photos after photos of cracks and crevices and of small pools and trickles. I can't get enough of the view. Ahead of me, the ripples of ice look like a meringue. It's like some giant hand came down and whipped the ice to make soft peaks, you know? I know that sounds really gay, but it's just that everything looked saaawft. We stop where we drank from the small pond that has formed on the ice. The water is naturally cold and refreshing, but we still manage to convince ourselves that it is the best-tasting water we've ever had. For only US$100! I jump when the guide isn't looking and we do ridiculous poses when we get a chance to stop. They take us to small caves and let us peek down dangerous crevices. We walk across thin ice, jump over safe indentations and hike up and down small hills to get a feel of the massiveness of Perito Moreno. We end at a table where our guide chips off glacial ice to drink with the Famous Grouse whisky they've set up beforehand. Everyone toasts and munches on the dulce de leche candies they distribute. It's the perfect end to our day. Later, the group tells me that the money they paid was all worth it.

After hauling aSs down from Camp Poincenot yesterday, G's foot started to hurt; he opted out of today's hike. The three of us start our longest hike this week via the path behind the Cerro Torre Hotel in El Chalten. We feel more energized after yesterday's shower and last night's sleep on real beds. I am ready to take it easy with just a day pack even though the hike is longer than the others. After an unmarked steep hill, we hike through a forest. The trees are dry and sharp, like from a Tim Burton movie. The earth itself is very thin and dusty. The ranger the other day told us that this hike is where you can view Cerro Torre and Monte Fitz Roy together, but it's not worth doing if visibility is zero. A lot of people hike El Chalten and miss the chance to see them at once because of the finicky weather, but it's looking like we will be very lucky today. I hold my breath. The hike takes forever and the landscape change from forest to uphills to dry marsh to another forest and then to large rocks. There are a lot of yellow flowers low on the ground which is what I pretty much imagined seeing before getting here. We pass by a swamp with thorny trees before we start walking along the Rio Fitz Roy. Cerro Torre shows itself early and I'm delighted that, although there is a watercolor-like smear of white above it, everything else looks clear blue. We take a turn towards the viewpoint and Monte Fitz Roy also says hello. So this is what the ranger and the others before us have been talking about. I notice that there is more snow on the Cerro Torre side than on Fitz Roy's. As soon as we go through the flat plains, the wind immediately picks up and the three of us put on our jackets. It's like being in a wind tunnel: you push an invisible force forward without looking at where you're going and you try to block your face from being completely blown away. The gravel makes it even harder to ascend up the hill that reveals Lago Torre. But oh, as soon as I get to the top, it's like being transported to a different land; a different country. The wind is howling and there is a heavy feeling about it. It looks like something scary is about to happen, as if there was already a story before time began. I notice right away that Cerro Torre is thinner, spikier and angrier than Monte Fitz Roy. The tips of each spire has a mushroom cap of ice because of the Pacific storms that blow from the Patagonian Ice Cap. In 1959, Cesare Maestri and Toni Egger supposedly reached the summit, but inconsistencies in Maestri's account made other climbers doubtful. Egger died in an avalanche during that attempt, and the second tallest spire was named after him, but it left Maestri's account unverified. In 2005, a confirmed route was put up on the face that Maestri claimed to have climbed by Ermanno Salvaterra, Alessandro Beltrami and Rolando Garibotti. It was only a year ago, in January 2008, when the same Garibotti, with American Colin Haley, climbed Aguja Standhardt, Punta Herron, Torre Egger and Cerro Torre together, accomplishing the first complete traverse of the entire massif with a 7,200-feet total vertical gain. I feel like a wimp again as we go down the path and to the safe confines of Camp D'Agostini just below it. I try to imagine those who have climbed Cerro Torre to give the sport a good name and people like me a glimpse of the impossible becoming possible. We settle and eat our last camp-style lunch before we begin to head back down to El Chalten. On the way back, I get to enjoy the view I missed on the way. The river doesn't look so rapid from this far away and everything around me looks more like the Swiss Alps than Patagonia. I pause after I say this to the Dr. and add, What I imagine Switzerland to look like anyway, because I've never been there. Funnily enough, our friend commented of our last trail during dinner: That looked like the time I was in Switzerland. All that eerie feeling is replace by the Sound of Music. All of a sudden, there are white blossoms and Alpine-style cabins. The starkness of Cerro Torre that's in my head becomes more manageable and transforms into a panoramic photograph featured on calendars. I can't say that I like it better, but it certainly makes the end of our Chalten hike more pleasant. Day 3 itinerary: Related post/s: Cerro Torre photos on Flickr Day 2: Hiking to Lago de los Tres and Laco Sucia This is great story on Maestri and Cerro Torre Here's the stupendous account of Garibotti and Haley Photos that make me shiver from Ermanno Salvaterra

It was a very cold night on Camp Poincenot. Our sleeping bags were warm but the Dr. had a restless sleep, wearing almost everything he'd pack to keep extra warm. I was okay in a long-sleeved Capilene and underpants until around 3am when I felt a cold breeze coming from the side of our tent. I had the chills and squirmed inside my sleeping bag to put extra layers on. It was my first time to camp in the woods, and though I liked the process of the whole thing, I can't say sleeping in a bag so close to the ground is my favorite thing. Today I wake up first to boil some water and get the coffee ready. I know the boys will need it especially if I want them to be good sports about the vertical hike that's to come. I send them to the river where it's warmer to collect some water to drink so they can stretch while waiting for the congee to cook. Here in Patagonia, water from running rivers is potable. We were apprehensive at first, but because everyone else was doing it, we joined in. We never had to use our $50 purification system after all. From the camp, we begin our hike to Lago de los Tres with only our day packs. We hike through another forest and continue to go up for the next hour and a half. From the highest viewpoints, we see several lakes and never-ending trees. I imagine how white everything would be if it isn't summer. I remember from the other day when the ranger told us that this hike is easy because of the stairs. There are stairs all right, but they are steep and they keep going up. The sun is out in full force though, and I am only wearing a tank top to keep myself cool. The path starts to transform into gravel and crushed soil, almost like sand. You sink whenever you take a step, but I know a closer look at Monte Fitz Roy is just ahead. When I walk over the last hill, the last hurdle to the finish line, I gasp because I did not expect to see what's immediately in front of me: the greenest of the green with the bluest of the blue water, surrounded by boulders spotted with fresh white snow. I want to cry. At this close proximity, I acknowledge the entirety of the Fitz Roy range. Starting from Fitz Roy's 12,300 feet going to my left is Poincenot, also our camp's namesake, at about 9,850; Aguja Raphael at about 8,100; Aguja Saint-Exupery at about 8,400; and Aguja de la S, aka Aguja Innominata, at about 7,600. The three granite agujas, or needles, are the \"tres\" in the name Lago de los Tres, or Lake of the Three. In 1952, the French alpinist Jacques Poincenot fell in the river and died during a trip to conquer Fitz Roy. Antoine de Saint-Exupery, of Le Petit Prince fame, delivered mail to Patagonia via the French airline Aerospostale from 1929 to 1932. His co-pilots are honored with the two summits north of Fitz Roy: Aguja (Jean) Mermoz and Aguja (Henri) Guillaumet. The entire thing is more majestic and spectacular this close. Of course, a cloud is swirling around the spires, but even with the wind, it's calm and it's giving me that feeling that everything around me is older than time. I realize that this earth is truly a place one can't stop appreciating because at every other turn, it will leave you in awe. I see people closer to the water and leave my group to walk down. It's the wrong and dangerous choice because on every step, a few rocks loosen behind me and roll. It's too late to stop and walk back up; I am on my aSs just trying to slide down gingerly. When I get to the bottom, I lie on a big rock and look up the blue sky. Upside-down, I can see more people now and they're all sitting at where I was before. Everyone is speechless and staring at the Fitz Roy range. I bask under the sun and get my raccoon tan. After a few minutes, I decide to walk the opposite way and see what else is around. I see a spike with a yellow tip and realize it's a trail marker from where we entered. It's the path I should have taken instead of blazing down the rocks. At least now I know how to safely go back up. I'm alone when I make the next hill over and while I'm thinking that that was the best viewpoint yet, I come across a danger sign to warn me that the trail stops there. I take a couple of steps down and follow the sound of a waterfall. It's a small trickle, but the sound echoes loud enough as if I was in a cathedral. I laugh to myself as soon as I discover where the water was going. All I can think of is, Where the hell am I? I unfold my map and realize that I am right above Lago Sucia. Even though the name means \"dirty\", there is nothing dirty about the water except for the fact that it has a deeper hue than Lago de los Tres. It's even more still here because it's surrounded by Cerro Techado Negro, the range that climbers must pass through to camp on Glaciar Rio Blanco before they attempt an ascend. I reunite with the group again and I encourage them to take the short trail down to Sucia. I wait for them behind a large rock and borrow a pair of binoculars from two other hikers who were pointing towards Fitz Roy: there are at least four ant-sized people on the snow going up. I imagine what they must be feeling now. I send them good vibes and hope they make it as high as they want to go. On the way down, we run into more people going up. We don't recognize them from camp so we assume they have come all the way from El Chalten to do the whole trail as a day trip. Alas, there are people who are stronger than I am. I tread carefully and take care of my left knee. Miraculously, it hasn't hurt and I am determined to keep it that way. Back at Camp Poincenot, we all agree to pack up and go back down to El Chalten to escape another chilly night in our tents. We use the other route down via Lago Capri and watch families with children set up picnics by the water. I feel like a wimp for hiking with so much weight only to stay for one night, but the temptation of having a sit-down dinner with a bottle of Malbec is too hard to resist; not to mention a hot shower and a working toilet.

I am excited but at the same time nervous. I'm geared up and waiting for the rest of my group outside Rancho Grande Hostel to begin our first day of hiking. Today's plan is to hike along Chorillo del Salto and get our first glimpse of Monte Fitz Roy, one of the two that tower over El Chalten in this part of Argentina's Patagonia. I am carrying about thirty pounds worth of clothes, my sleeping bag and our toiletries, while the Dr. is carrying our tent with his own gear. We've split our provisions between us, but I still made sure he carried the heavier jjajang tuna cans. Yesterday, I was antsy during the five-hour drive from El Calafate to El Chalten. When I started to see Glacier Viedma up front, the largest glacier on the eastern slopes of the Andes, I turned to see if my companions were awake. My heart thumped: I made it! I made it to Patagonia! Rain flecked my window and I thought, Rain all you want now but please, please stop for the next five days. I am reminded that the name Chalten comes from a Tehuelche word meaning \"smoking mountain\", due to a cloud that usually forms in the top. We all stopped by the National Parks office to get an introduction and to listen to the rules of the park before the bus dropped us off at Rancho Grande where we had reservations for four bunk beds. Our humble room will be one of the many reminders of our hike in the Spanish Pyrenees back in 2006. It's the beginning of peak season and we were surrounded by people who were also ready to hike: tall backpacks leaned against the walls and boots stacked up by the main door. Some of them we'll encounter again on the trail and all of them we'll share this Patagonian experience with. We start walking towards the yellow house at the end of the road. The sun is striking at 10am and there is barely a cloud in the sky. I quietly hope that it stays that way. Here in Santa Cruz, Argentina, the weather is finicky and unpredictable. From reading Greg Crouch's Enduring Patagonia before I left New York City, I learned that the wind will be our enemy. We start slow and up; my shoulders getting used to the weight on my back. I'm bundled up, but I'm hot and I know if I remove my fleece, I'd have to put it back on again when I turn the next corner. The trail is well-marked but rough. The soil is very dry and padded with small rocks and I can't stop to take photographs of the dots of yellow and purple flowers along the way because there are others behind me. We reach our first viewpoint where we could see the swirls of the Chorillo River. At last, rest. I'm surprised at how green everything is. I imagined tumbleweeds rolling along the flat plains while the wind whistled in the background. It hasn't been an hour yet and Patagonia is already throwing surprises at me. We mostly hike narrow paths through the forest until the trail finally opens up where we walk on cliffs and then onto flat land with small ponds. All of a sudden, there it is: Monte Fitz Roy and its ever-recognizable shape. I know because I've spent five months planning this trip for the group and I have seen numerous photos of its grandeur and glory. Right now, I can't believe I'm finally looking at it in person. Its name was bestowed by explorer Perito Moreno after the Beagle's captain, Robert Fitzroy, who sailed the area around 1834. Even though it's not even half the height of the Himalayas, its granite makes climbing it harder even for the most experienced. More than a hundred people summit Mount Everest a day, but only one successfully ascends Monte Fitz Roy a year. Everyone is taking photos and it takes a few tries and more energy than I can muster to jump for one of my Cia photos. I haven't worn my sweater in the last hour and I already have a criss-cross tan below my neck. I want to stay and savor the view even though I know there will be more. At Camp Poincenot, we pick a spot where the boys set up our two tents. We stretch and get used to our backs without all the weight and we eat our first energy bars for lunch. Because it was the middle of the afternoon, we decide to take a quick walk to see Lago Piedras Blancas where the glacier truly looks like flowing water frozen in time. It's a much easier hike without our packs, but not less rewarding. Back in camp, we begin to unwind and rest for the night-just in time when that swish of a cloud around Fitz Roy start to look like it's going to make its way down. The clouds are more gray and we feel some rain coming. We are all surprised that the hike up here took less than four hours, but while we cook and eat our first meal of vegetable Jambalaya, miso soup and Korean tuna, we know that it was enough for today.

214 East 10th Street between First and Second Avenues 866/602-8779 about $25 for two, with drinks, without tip ♥ Yohshoku, or Western dishes adapted to fit the Japanese taste, kept me alive when I was younger and wasn't making a lot of or any money. In West L.A., I loved Curry House because I could get a hefty lunch for $5. When I was in Tokyo, I ate a lot of gyuudon and tonkatsu (beef bowls and deep-fried pork cutlets) because they were the most affordable for us kids with a tight budget. Believe it or not, back then I spent my money on design books instead of food. So when Curry-Ya opened last year, I was excited to go even for the sake of reliving those days. True to form, my kareh raisu, the Japanese-style curry so far removed from its inspiration, tasted like how I remember them: rich, gooey, salty, and just super tasty. Unfortunately, I'm older now and I paid a higher price digesting it afterwards. I still appreciate good design and Curry-Ya has that style I would like to adapt if ever I opened my own restaurant: marble bar, less than twenty stools up against it, open kitchen. I'm not any younger, but I'm back to having less money because of this economy and I can see more Curry-Ya in my future.

Where to eat in Jersey City, New Jersey: Dosa Hut

My first exposure to dosas was from Hampton Chutney and, I must admit, wasn't the most authentic. I still like eating at Hampton Chutney once in a while even though they're overpriced and I've since searched for good, and less expensive, dosas in the city. Shit, I've even spent several hours trying to make a Nepalese version at home. My parents and I met up with Honey and Paolo in Jersey City to check out a Filipino man in the suburbs who apparently can give you the same diagnosis as a chiropractor and help you as much as a physical therapist can. My father has always complained of lower back problems; my mother almost broke her hip and wrist when she fell off a ladder; I still have a busted left knee from hiking the Pyrenees. He didn't accept any kind of payment-though we ended up buying tocino and longanisa from the wife who makes them at home-so we didn't see any harm in visiting him. An hour later, we were famished. Honey drove us to Dosa Hut for lunch where I introduced my parents to vegetarian meals that actually made them full. My parents, always hard to please, refer to all kinds of South Asian food as \"Bombay\". They've never seen a dosa before and wouldn't be able to tell one curry from the next. So when I ordered, I asked the lady behind the counter what made their \"special dosa\" special. It contained cabbage, green bell peppers and onions and was fit for two people. The flavor wasn't as special as the classic dosa however, stuffed with cheese and parsley. It didn't seem much at first, but it was deliciously light yet still filling. The crepe itself was crisp and the different chutneys gave my folks a good education about dips outside of the usual Filipino soy sauce and vinegar. Oh, my left knee has been okay since that visit. Dosa Hut is at 777 Newark Avenue in Jersey City, New Jersey and is all vegetarian. You can call them at 201/420.6660.

241 Church Street at Leonard 212/925.0202 $75 for tasting menu, without drinks, without tip ♥ ♥ 66 was a long time ago but entering Matsugen reminded me of those long lunch hours I used to take to eat at an expensive restaurant and only pay lunch prices. I had a delicate dim sum meal back then, even before Chinatown Brasserie opened, and it cost triple what I would have paid at Jing Fong. No screaming waiters, though, and the white tablecloths remained white even after several dumplings and shumais. Contrary to popular belief, Jean-Georges Vongerichten is not the chef at Matsugen. Put together the Matsushita brothers wanting their first U.S. mainland restaurant and Jean-Georges needing to replace 66 and you have a high-end Japanese restaurant in a beautifully-designed Richard Meier TriBeCa space. It's more chic than Honmura An (ahh, more memories!) and it's more serene than EN Brasserie. Is it expensive? Definitely, especially if you're used to Sobaya like me. But if you want to impress, it's a good place to go, not just for the soba noodles made in-house, but also for sushi, sashimi and even shabu-shabu (also considerably more expensive than Shabu Tatsu's). If you spend some time looking at the menu, you can get away with paying less than a hundred dollars for two. You won't be achingly full, but you'll get the idea why a big-time chef like Jean-Georges would be satisfied with only being behind the scenes on this one. If you don't want to be bothered with the several pages of Japanese food with detailed descriptions, the $75 tasting menu when we visited included uni with yuzu jelly-a beautifully assembled starter that's as creamy as the freshest sea urchin around-a sushi plate, a lobster salad, a bowl of hot soba and a dessert. I highly recommend the hot soba in duck soup and the hot soba with Japanese yam. The noodles yield freely and the broth is so clean: refined Japanese food has never been better.

This Jamie Oliver lamb recipe may seem to require a lot of ingredients but once you have them, all you need to do is toss everything together to marinate the meat. I substituted the lamb with pork roast and served it to guests for my mother's 61st birthday. I didn't even use salt because all the herbs were enough to give the roast a delicious Thai-inspired flavor. You'll find how amazing the lemongrass smell lingers in the meat even after several reheats of the leftovers. Ingredients: 1 pork roast, bone-in, about 5 pounds For the marinade: 1 stalk lemongrass, cut in short pieces, smashed 10 kaffir lime leaves, chopped 1 medium-sized knob of ginger, peeled, sliced half a head of garlic, minced half a bunch of cilantro, roughly chopped 4 Thai chilies, chopped juice from 3 limes olive oil 1. Marinate the pork roast. Pat pork roast dry with a paper towel. Transfer to a large glass container that you can use to marinate. Stir together the olive oil and lime juice in a small bowl and drizzle all over the roast. Stuff every nook with garlic and herbs. Cover with plastic wrap and store in the fridge overnight. 2. When ready to cook, preheat oven to 425º. Remove the pork from the refrigerator and let rest at room temperature until oven is ready. Place an empty aluminum foil-lined roasting pan in the oven while the oven is pre-heating. When oven is ready, transfer the roast to the pan and cook for 45 minutes. 3. Reduce heat to 325º and roast an additional hour, or about 10 minutes per pound. Using a meat thermometer, the thickest part of the roast must be around 130º. Remove to a chopping block and let stand for half an hour before carving. Related post/s: You can get all the herbs and spices at Asia Food Market

For the love of meat, Jake Dickson of Dickson Farmstand worked in several farms, a butcher shop and a slaughterhouse. All the effort paid off and he thought of a brilliant business plan: buy your upstate produce online and pick it up in the city from the back of his truck. I bought a boneless leg of lamb from Ehrhardt Farm in Jersey Hill, one of the highest elevations in Tompkins County, New York. I also ordered a package of fatty bacon and ground pork but I'll focus on the leg of lamb so that you can replicate it for your end-of-year dinner. Ingredients: 1 4-pound boneless leg of lamb, tied up with butcher's twine salt, pepper For marinade: 1/2 cup orange juice 1 cup white wine 3 cloves garlic, minced 3 sprigs of thyme 2 sprigs of rosemary oil, pepper 1. Marinate lamb. Pat leg of lamb dry with a paper towel. On a chopping block as a work surface, drizzle olive oil all over the lamb and rub with pepper. Stuff every nook of leg of lamb with garlic and herbs. Transfer to a large glass container that you can use to marinate. Combine orange juice and white wine in a small bowl and pour into the container to marinate the lamb. Cover with plastic wrap and store in the fridge overnight. Make sure you turn over the lamb after several hours to soak the other side. 2. When ready to cook, remove the lamb from the fridge and let rest at room temperature. Arrange two racks in the oven: the middle rack to hold the lamb and the lower rack to hold a roasting pan to catch the drippings. (Spread chopped carrots, parsnips and onions in the pan for some roasted veggies to go with the lamb.) Preheat oven to 425º. Place the empty aluminum foil-lined roasting pan in the oven while the oven is pre-heating. 3. Cook the lamb. Remove the lamb from the container and pat dry with paper towels. Generously salt and pepper all sides of the lamb. Place directly on middle rack of the oven; the roasting pan below will catch the drippings. Roast for 20 minutes, then reduce the heat to 300º and roast an additional hour, or about 10 minutes per pound. Using a meat thermometer, the thickest part of the lamb must be around 135º for medium-rare. Let stand for half an hour before carving. Use just the drippingsand/or the roasted veggies to serve with the lamb.

'Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the house / Not a creature was stirring,... Are you kidding me? Whoever the author was wasn't in my parents' house on Christmas Eve. It's definitely not quiet in ours right now: my mother is vacuuming, my father is moving stuff around and I'm simultaneously getting the leg of lamb and pork roast ready for our noche buena, clanging around the kitchen. I'm not a regular churchgoer, but you can count on me to attend Christmas Eve mass even if it's cold outside and boring inside. Because it's also the eve of my birthday, I've always found mass quite comforting before I turn a year older. Wherever I am, I make it a point to attend mass for my birthday. After mass, we dive in for dinner and eat until a little after midnight-Christmas Day itself is just recovering from the night before. This pasta e fagioli recipe, or \"pasta and beans\" in Italian, is a hearty (and affordable!) filler to keep the hunger pangs away at least until after church, but not too heavy that you would want to skip the main attraction on the dining table. I used Goya pinto beans here because one package was on sale for 99 cents and substituted the Parmesan cheese for Manchego. Ingredients: 1 cup pinto beans, soaked overnight in water 2 cups mini penne pasta 4 slices bacon, chopped 3 large beefsteak tomatoes, chopped 2 stalks of celery, chopped 1 large carrot, chopped 1 red onion, chopped 2 cloves garlic, minced 1 sprig of rosemary 2 sprigs of thyme Manchego cheese salt, pepper 1. Drain the water from the soaking beans. In a large saucepan, add 3 cups of water and bring the beans to a boil. Lower the heat and simmer for an hour, or until tender. When done, transfer beans and water to a large container and set aside. 2. Using the same saucepan, cook the bacon until crisp. Add the garlic and saute until light brown. Add the onions and saute until translucent. Add the herbs, carrots, celery and tomatoes and stir to combine. Cook until carrots are tender. 3. Return the beans and the water to the saucepan and let simmer for 30 minutes. Add more water if you want more soup. Season liberally with salt and pepper. Add the macaroni and simmer for another 10 minutes, or just enough to cook the pasta. Stir occasionally. Ladle into bowls and grate cheese on top before serving.

Ah, Internet, you kill me. It sucks to be laid off for the second time in eight years especially if it's from a job you actually like. But shit happens, yeah? The good thing is that I can wake up without scurrying out the door and I can devote some time to the art of making sandwiches for lunch. Take for example this afternoon: leftover pernil that I carved from the bone, Gorgonzola from Di Palo Selects, a lone pear from the fruit basket on the coffee table and a handful of walnuts from a can of assorted holiday nuts; I threw in three slices of bacon in there for good measure. This sandwich is not for the faint of heart. Substitute the pork with sweet ham and add some spicy arugula to make a sweet-salty version. Ingredients: leftover pork roast, chopped 3 slices of bacon half a pear, sliced thinly a small chunk of Gorgonzola, sliced a handful of walnuts, crushed 4 slices of whole wheat bread a small knob of butter, melted in microwave 1. Cook bacon. Using a skillet, cook about 4 slices of bacon until crisp. Remove to a paper towel-lined plate. Set aside. 2. Using the rendered bacon fat in the same skillet, heat up pear slices. Remove to same paper towel-lined plate. 3. Assemble sandwich. On a chopping board, spread one side of each bread slice evenly with some melted butter using a pastry brush. With buttered sides down, spoon some pork roast on two slices of bread and top with Gorgonzola slices. Add bacon and pears and sprinkle with walnuts. Feel free to moisten with leftover bacon fat. Layer with remaining bread, buttered side up. 4. Place large skillet over high heat and brush remaining butter. Reduce heat to medium-low and add sandwich. Using an iron grill press, put on top of the sandwich and press. Cook until browned and crisp on both sides, about 4 minutes a side. Transfer to a platter lined with parchment paper. Cut in half and serve.

Pernil, Pork Shoulder Roast

I texted Lily when I saw a $9 pork shoulder at Fairway: what do I need to make pernil? Pernil, or roasted pork shoulder, is a Latin dish served as part of a feast, usually with rice and beans. I grew up in Washington Heights with my Dominican friends and have always eaten pernil at their birthday parties. Years have passed and they've all moved out of their parents' houses and I haven't had a decent pernil since. Thankfully for Lily's birthday this past summer, she decided to keep it low-key and invited us to her mother's house. I thought I ate the best pernil there. Her mother even wrapped some leftovers for me to take home because I couldn't stop picking from it even after dinner was over. My friends' parents are all too familiar with the Asian friend who raves about the roasted pork. This is in preparation for Christmas Eve dinner. My first try didn't come out as tender as I would have liked: Lily's version melts in your mouth and it's impossible to slice the meat because everything just falls off the bone. I've revised this recipe and made some corrections. I'll be ready to try it again for my birthday dinner and I'll make Lily proud. Ingredients: 1 pork shoulder, no more than 5 pounds 1 head of garlic, peeled, crushed 4 tbsps cumin, grounded a few splashes of Worcestershire sauce salt, pepper 1. Marinate the pork shoulder. Score the pork with a sharp knife and insert garlic cloves in every nook. Splash Worcestershire sauce all over the pork. Using your hands, liberally rub the pork with cumin, salt and pepper. Put in a large container and cover with plastic wrap. Refrigerate overnight. 2. When ready to cook, heat oven to 300º. Remove the pork from the refrigerator and let rest at room temperature until oven is ready. Roast pork for 3 hours on a rack in an aluminum foil-lined roasting pan filled halfway with water, turning every hour until meat is tender. Add water to the pan as necessary. 3. Remove pork from the oven and let rest for 15 minutes before cutting it up.

61 Grove Street off Seventh Avenue South 212/242.3699 $30 each for four, with a bottle of sake, with tip ♥ ♥ I love pigs' feet. There I said it. I've caramelized them before with a tart salad and I've grilled them to serve at a summer barbecue party. Hakata Tonton worships the tonsoku. Hakata Tonton and I were made for each other. The grilled version is so gelatinous, succulent and generously fatty, you can't help but suck every part until you're just spitting out the small bones. The hot pot comes with tofu, dumplings and pork belly, as if the trotters weren't enough to make the broth rich and tasty. There were four of us, hungry after a few glasses of wine and beer, so we didn't just stay with the pork but also ordered the chicken wings in sweet soy sauce and the beef short ribs. We threw in the yellowtail sashimi salad in there for a palate cleanser. The yuzu paste and ponzu sauce were just perfect for slathering and dipping because they provided the right amount of kick in each dish. (When I was in Vancouver, I bought a few jars of yuzu paste from the Japanese grocery store to take home with me.) A few beer and sake bottles later, we left full and a little tipsy. Our wallets weren't empty and we were happy to be escorted out with free Pez candies from the waitress.

I missed it when The Times first reported it last week: the Maya Schaper Cheese and Antiques store in the upper west side is going to be replaced by a coffee shop because of soaring rents. Good thing then that the Dr. and I stopped by today to buy some cheese. The Dr. picked up a beautiful stinky blue cheese while I walked around gasping at the prices of the Rococo-style plates I'd very much like to afford and own. I tasted the cheese he bought and got my own sliver, and I also picked up a Manchego because I wanted to use the butternut squash that has been sitting on my window kitchen sill since the last Supper with Strangers. (It was still good.) I like baking gratins because they're so easy. They're a nice addition to a dinner setting: you get your starch and in this case, your vegetable, too. I love the hint of salt and savory in this recipe even though it's a creamy baked dish. It went perfectly well with a pork shoulder roasted for three hours. Ingredients: 1 butternut squash, peeled, chopped lengthwise, sliced thin 2 sweet potatoes, peeled, sliced thin like coins 2 cups Manchego cheese, shredded 1 pint heavy cream 2 cloves of garlic, minced 2 tbsps fresh thyme a small knob of butter salt, pepper 1. Preheat oven to 400º. In a saucepan, bring cream and garlic to a simmer. Remove from heat and set aside, stirring occasionally to keep the top from gelling. 2. Butter a 9\"x13\" shallow baking dish. Spread the sliced butternut squash out in a single overlapping layer. Sprinkle with some of the salt, pepper and thyme and then about a third of the grated cheese. Top with half of the sweet potatoes, building a new overlapping layer. Again sprinkle with some of the seasonings and another third of shredded cheese. Use the last of the potatoes to make one final layer and top with the remaining cheese. Pour over the garlic cream mixture, distributing evenly. 4. Bake the gratin. Cover the dish with foil and bake on the middle rack for 30 minutes. Remove the foil, move the gratin to the top rack of the oven and bake, uncovered, for an additional 20 minutes. The top should be nicely browned and the vegetables soft. Remove from oven and let cool for 30 minutes before serving.

32 West 52nd Street between Fifth and Sixth Avenues 212/582.6900 $200 for two, with wine, without tip ♥ ♥ By the fifth time someone asked us if everything was okay, I paused and looked into the waiter's eyes and told him, Really. We're okay. I like good service as much as anybody else but there's a fine line between being attentive and annoying. Our waiter swung by a few times to see if we needed drink refills (our wine glasses were still more than a third full), a couple of busboys tried to clear our plates away while we were still working on them and two other waiters whom we've never seen before also came by to ask if we were okay. I looked around the restaurant to see if we were holding up our table for too long, but it was fairly empty at 8pm. Were the servers just bored? When we had uninterrupted minutes to ourselves, we were able to enjoy the food. The kitchen started us off with a lamb sausage amuse which my dining companion didn't eat because she is quasi-vegetarian. I thought it was odd that no one ever bothered to ask her. I figured that they probably assumed we both eat meat because we were at a Greek restaurant. The smoked octopus with fennel and mushrooms in lemon confit was so fragrant while the salad of Brussels sprouts and beets was so beautifully presented. The mullet and sweetbreads combined with bitter greens were a good mix in terms of texture, although I wasn't a fan of the bulghur wheat that came with the roasted mushrooms and hen's egg. By the time the quail and the tuna tartare were served, I was already full. My friend, skipping the meaty dishes, had room for the cotton candy with petit fours and the rich chocolate tart with ice cream. We were really more than okay.

Here's a stocking stuffer for your discerning friends: Biscotti Di Vecchio. These traditional twice-baked Tuscan cookies get a twist from Danielle Di Vecchio, who works the dough by hand using her grandmother's original recipe. From the savory, at $7.95 per dozen: The sun-dried tomato with basil and cheddar cheese was awesome with a glass of Malbec because of its saltiness. It was flakier and more floury because of the cheese. It smelled good, too, even though the basil taste was barely there. It was hard for me to tell the difference between the black pepper Asiago Parmesan from the rosemary and thyme walnut because I was eating them one after the other, but the black pepper was definitely present when I ate it separately. It remained my favorite savory flavor after everything else. For the sweets, at $16.95 per dozen: The cranberry in the cranberry orange zest added a good chewiness to the biscotti's texture, but it was the zest that lingered and made an impression. I thought it would have been great with some peach or apricot-infused tea. The pistachio chocolate chocolate chunk, according to my mother, was like eating a dark chocolate bar in a biscotti. (Twice the chocolate in the name!) She had no complaints. The white chocolate macadamia had a subtle vanilla taste. I wanted a cup of hot chocolate with marshmallows with it. The simplest one, toasted almond, was the most biscotti of them all, and just comforting with a cup of hot barley tea. I think my favorite was the cayenne cherry chocolate chunk. The flavors came in stages: the chocolate was strong at first, followed by the faint tartness of the cherry; the spiciness gradually hit my tongue and then slowly settled in. I loved the unexpected combination and I think any recipient will be surprised. All in all, Biscotti di Vecchio biscottis are not tough like the ones you buy in stores. They remained pleasantly crunchy even after a weekend in their plastic packaging and I was able to keep the leftovers fresh just by putting them in a resealable container. I think these biscottis make classy gifts especially during these tough times. If you can't decide which flavor to give, there is a sweet and savory gift combination for $44.50.

Lamb Shank in Ras-El-Hanoot

I am so sick of turkey leftovers that I'm going to gag if I think about it one more time. After the gym tonight, I stopped by Whole Foods to pick up one lamb shank from the meat department. Surprisingly, one piece came out a little under $7.50 versus the exorbitant Whole Foods price I always tsk-tsk at. This recipe is from Janna Gur's beautiful cookbook, The Book of New Israeli Food. She's well known as the editor of Israel's leading food and wine magazine, Al Hashulchan Gastronomic Monthly, so I thought the recipes would be hard to make. I was surprised at how easy to understand they were even though I'm not familiar with Jewish customs. Ras-El-Hanoot, or \"Top of the Store\", is a Moroccan spice mixture used to season meat. Apparently, every spice vendor has his own secret formula on how to make it. In this version, I've eliminated 1 tbsp of aniseed because I just didn't have any, so I doubled the fennel seed measurement instead. You can certainly substitute aniseed with one star anise plus a pinch of allspice powder. This lamb dish is one leftover I wouldn't mind having again and again. Ingredients: 1 lamb shank 1 medium carrot, chopped 2 celery stalks, chopped 5 sprigs of parsley, chopped 1 quart chicken stock 1 onion, chopped 2 garlic cloves, minced 1 bay leaf 2 thyme sprigs salt, oil For Ras-El-Hanoot mixture: 2 tbsps paprika 2 tbsps fennel seeds 1 tbsp turmeric 1 tbsp coriander seeds 1. Make Ras-El-Hanoot mixture by crushing all the ingredients together using a mortar and pestle. Set aside. 2. In a large Dutch oven, heat some oil over medium heat. Rub salt all over the lamb. Add the lamb shank and brown on all sides. Remove from pot when done. 3. In the same pot using the remaining oil, saute garlic until brown and onions until soft. Add carrot, celery, parsley, bay leaf, thyme and the Ras-El-Hanoot mixture and cook for 5 minutes. 4. Add chicken stock and bring to a boil. Return the lamb to the pot and bring to a boil again. Lower the heat, cover and cook for 1 hour. Turn over the lamb and cook for 45 minutes to an hour, or until the meat is almost falling off the bone. Uncover the pot and cook for another 15 minutes to thicken the sauce. Related post/s: Buy your own copy of The Book of New Israeli Food: A Culinary Journey from Amazon.com

171 Spring Street between West Broadway and Thompson 212/343.4255 $70 for three, with drinks, without tip ♥ ♥ I felt like I got the gist of Boqueria SoHo after I stopped by for \"dessert\" with my brother and sister-in-law during its second weekend. We walked in around 5:45pm to eat an early dinner but were turned away because the bar was full. The maitre d' refused to seat us fifteen minutes before the official start of dinner service. It seemed like a ridiculous rule only a person with a clipboard would impose, so we went to Snack around the corner instead for a better dinner. My companions really wanted to taste some Spanish wines, so we returned after dinner to try and score seats at one of the long tables in the middle of the restaurant. We were seated immediately by the beautiful pata negro and a few spots away from a swollen-looking Bobby Flay. We started with beers on tap before we moved on to the full-bodied red wines. Because we were only there to pick and taste, we shared the Garrotxa goat cheese, the Valdeon blue and the Idiazabal, a smoked sheep's milk cheese. A smattering of salchichon was thrown in the mix for a few extra dollars. The Brussels sprouts with sausage was a favorite, as well as the roasted green peppers I learned to love while I was in Barcelona. Two years ago, I said the food at the first Boqueria needed to be more inspired. It's more refined here in SoHo, but the attitude need not match the neighborhood.

They were open because they had people at the bar. I suppose they could have seated us early since we were already there, just so they didn't have to turn us away. We could have ordered drinks and waited until it was the right time to order dinner.

I thought I would have more leftovers from Thanksgiving to make a week's worth of lunch. But everyone in the house liked this sandwich so much, I was able to make them only two times before we ran out of leftover turkey. The sourdough and the porcini mushrooms were extra ingredients from the homemade stuffing I made. I ended up clearing our fridge out before the holiday weekend was over. Ingredients: leftover Thanksgiving turkey, sliced, heated in the broiler 4 slices of bacon 4 porcini mushrooms, chopped sourdough bread, sliced, toasted For onion relish: 1 yellow onion, thinly sliced 1/8 cup dark brown sugar 1/4 cup red-wine vinegar 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar 1. Make onion relish. In a saucepan, boil the onions in water until soft. Remove from heat and drain. Return to the pot and add brown sugar, red-wine vinegar and balsamic vinegar. Simmer in low fire until liquid is thick-I had this simmering until I was ready to assemble the sandwich. Stir occasionally. 2. Cook bacon. Using a skillet, cook about 4 slices of bacon until crisp. Remove to a paper towel-lined plate. Set aside. 3. Using the fat in the skillet rendered from the bacon, saute mushrooms over medium heat until soft, about 4 minutes. 4. Assemble sandwich! Lay toasted bread halves on a chopping board. On one half, spoon the onions and top with the turkey and onion relish. Top with the other half and hold together using a toothpick.

I'll take pig any time over a turkey but this year, I thought I'd tackle most of our Thanksgiving menu because it was the first time our family was complete since my brother permanently moved out of the States. My new sister-in-law and our favorite adoptee, Cameron, joined in the festivities. With the homemade stuffing and gravy, I combed through the many turkey recipes online and decided to put two recipes together from Bill Telepan and Alton Brown. Here they are in one, tested with love. The young twelve-pounder bird cost me almost $40 from Whole Foods so there was no room for mistake: for three days I carefully planned and participated in my first ever brined and roasted Thanksgiving turkey. I made the brine in a large glass pot where the turkey also fit; the glass pot fit in the refrigerator to brine for three days. You can definitely make your brine in a non-aluminum stockpot and just transfer it to a large container where the turkey can fit (also non-alumininum pail or basin) and just store, covered, in a cold place if it doesn't fit in the fridge. New Yorkers who don't have a basement can store it on their fire escape. On the day of cooking, give yourself at least five hours to prep and cook the turkey. Ingredients: 1 12-pound young turkey, unfrozen 1 stick of butter For the aromatics: 1 apple, sliced 1 cinnamon stick 1 bunch sage leaves 1 medium red onion, quartered For the brine: 1/2 cup light brown sugar 1/2 cup salt 1 tbsp black peppercorns 1 tbsp juniper berries 1 tbsp allspice berries 1 small knob of ginger, peeled, crushed, chopped 1. Three days before serving, prepare the turkey in brine. Combine all brine ingredients in a large stockpot with enough water to submerge the whole turkey and bring to a boil. Stir to dissolve solids. Remove from heat and cool to room temperature. Set aside. 2. In the meantime, wash the turkey inside and out with cold water and let sit in a colander to drain. 3. Transfer the brine into a large non-aluminum container and submerge the turkey in the brine. If the turkey is not submerged fully, just make sure that you turn the turkey over 24 hours later to marinade the other side. 4. Early on the day of cooking, remove turkey from the brine into a colander to drain in room temperature for at least 30 minutes. Heat the oven to 500º while you wait with the rack on the lowest slot. 5. Prepare the aromatics. Combine the ingredients with 1/4 cup of water in a microwave-safe bowl and microwave on high for 5 minutes. Set aside. 6. Move the turkey to a chopping block and pat the turkey dry with paper towels, inside and out. Tuck back wings and drumsticks. Using your hands, rub butter and a palm-full of salt all over and inside the turkey. Add the microwaved aromatics inside the turkey. Transfer the turkey on a rack in an aluminum foil-lined roasting pan. 7. Set your alarm for these steps so you don't forget: Roast turkey for 30 minutes. Remove from oven and cover the turkey with thick aluminum foil and continue to roast for 1 hour, lowering the temperature to 350º. Remove from oven and carefully turn over the turkey to cook the other side. (I used the aluminum foil as potholders to turn it by hand.) Cover again and cook for another hour. Remove from oven a third time, uncover, and return to the oven for another 30 minutes to brown that side. 8. A total of three hours cooking time later, remove the turkey from the oven, stick a meat thermometer in the thigh and make sure the thickest part of the bird is perfectly cooked. (My thermometer said turkey is 180º.) Set the turkey, still on the rack, on a chopping block and let rest for up to 30 minutes before carving and serving.

This was a last-minute addition to my Thanksgiving menu this year. I've been cooking for three days but forgot to plan for a carb-I didn't know Cameron was going to bring homemade biscuits-so I made my brother run an errand to buy buttermilk and corn at the grocery store in the morning. Cornbread is easy enough to make, but I was intrigued by this recipe because of the spiciness. I didn't really know how it would translate to bread form. The final product tasted like regular cornbread-mine came out paler because I used white sugar-but the kick in the end was a nice surprise. It even made my dad cough the first time because it was so unexpected. Ingredients: 2 1/2 cups fresh corn kernels 1 tbsp red pepper flakes 1 cup white flour 3/4 cup cornmeal 1/4 cup brown sugar 1 tbsp baking powder 1 cup buttermilk 1 egg 2 tbsps butter 1 1/2 tsps salt 1. Preheat your oven to 350º with the rack in the middle slot. 2. In a medium glass bowl, whisk together the flour, cornmeal, sugar, baking powder and salt. In a separate bowl, whisk the buttermilk, egg and corn together. Pour the wet ingredients over the dry and stir until just combined. Set aside. 3. In a small saucepan, melt the butter and stir in the red pepper flakes and cook for 1 minute. Pour into a square baking dish. Top with the cornbread batter and level with a spatula. Bake for 45 minutes or until the edges are golden and the center is set. Remove from oven and let rest for up to 10 minutes before slicing into squares.

178 Broadway, right under the Williamsburg Bridge in Brooklyn 718/387-7400 about $350 for five, with a bottle of wine, with tip, cash only ♥ ♥ Our waiter spilled porterhouse juice all over my sister-in-law's hat. She wasn't wearing it at the time, but it still sucked when she realized it outside. It was windy and 30 degrees. I've been to Peter Luger several times and like most New Yorkers, I go for the porterhouse and not for the service. Being old school is one thing but the restaurant staff can really use some manners. Our waiter was brash: he grunted and interrupted whenever we had a question and he splashed sauce and fat on our table whenever he served. The attitude could be part of the draw that makes Peter Luger \"authentic\", but after paying over a thousand dollars the last six years, you'd think it would at least buy politeness. The food also hasn't changed. It's still the best place to get porterhouse in New York City even though they push every customer to get more than they can eat. (We watch a group of four novices at the next table fall for their bit and order three steaks for two. Their bill was already guaranteed to be $240 before ordering any side dishes or wine.) The bacon is still to die for and the creamed spinach still a good match to a perfectly-cooked piece of meat. Maybe when I return two years from now, I can finally tune the staff's attitude out and just eat my steak in peace. For now though, one less heart from the last review.

Since I've been mentioning gift ideas with sausage and cheese in the same post recently, I can't ignore Di Palo's new online store, Di Palo Selects, as another option for the holidays. New Yorkers and die-hard Italian tourists know that they can get the best of Italy from the Di Palo family on Grand Street, but now they can get the same products without spending money on airfare. The Web site is powered by iGourmet.com but it's less confusing because they've trimmed down the content to Lou Di Palo's favorites. While there are the useful related items cross-sells, descriptions are not as overwhelming. I love the glossary page and the Ask Lou feature: you get both in person when you visit the store, which is the main reason why wait times are usually longer than my allotted lunch hour. Some of my favorite meats and cheeses that I buy regularly from Di Palo's: - Piave - Truffle cheese - Crucolo - fresh mozarella - Prosciutto de Parma - Prosciutto de Coto - one of the sausages hanging from the ceiling - spicy soppressata I also restock on Di Palo's olive oil, those glass-jarred tuna, marinated olives and artichokes, as well as Illy coffee. Lou's brother, Sal, is my favorite. He sounds like Raymond from Everybody Loves Raymond and he makes sure that I always leave with a free treat. When it's your turn at Di Palo's, it's really your turn and no one else's. Now you can go online and every good thing is just a click away. Di Palo's Fine Foods is at 200 Grand Street corner of Mott in Little Italy, New York. Related post/s: Order your Di Palo's goods online And then pickle that soppressatta with herbs

At my last job, I ate lunch with a big group of people almost everyday. You can imagine how difficult it was to agree on a place that everyone liked, so one of the developers wrote a quick script where we could sort out our list of lunch places downtown and picked one for us with a click of a mouse, slot machine style. (We started with a pair of dice and each total was assigned to a restaurant, but we turned classy.) It's not technically food or drink, but a deck of City Shuffle's downtown and Brooklyn Diner's Deck came in the mail this week and I couldn't stop showing them off because it reminded me of that story. The idea is that when you can't seem to decide where to eat, you leave the decision-making to the cards. Each deck features fifty-two of the staff's favorite restaurants. My deck included the ones below 23rd Street in Manhattan and some from Brooklyn. There's also a Manhattan ($29.95) and a Bar and Lounge deck ($19.95). They're sleek and nicely-designed with the restaurant's info including very useful cross streets. The best thing about it? Each card is also a $10 coupon you can use at the restaurant after you spend a minimum of $30 before alcohol, tax and tip. If a restaurant has closed, you can \"swap\" the card by sending it back to City Shuffle and you'll get a replacement card to another eatery of their choosing. They're great as a stocking stuffer or a corporate gift to your employees. Related post/s: Buy your own deck at City Shuffle

212 Lafayette Street off Kenmare 212/925.9322 $40 for two, with 2 drinks, without tip ♥ ♥ Everything Serge Becker touches turns into the next place-to-be. (You've seen La Esquina and The Box in the news, right?) A 1pm lunch date with my friend at the bar started gloomy: we were meeting to drown our sorrows about the grim economy and the prospect of losing our jobs. But by the time I was halfway through my Swiss Lagrein wine and he was done with his Stella beer, we were celebrating the fact that it's still an incredible city to live in. People around us were drinking bottles and eating as if they have all the time in the world even though the giant Rolex clock above us ticked. (Hey, maybe they've lost their jobs already!) Sharply-dressed men waited for their equally beautiful partners to show up. We heard French and some other indistinguishable language behind us; ah, must be Euros taking a break from shopping. I opted for the comforting elbow pasta with ground beef in brown sauce and it came with applesauce on the side. It was weird, but if the Swiss say they go together, I believe them. It was an unusual combination I couldn't stop eating. The bratwurst was smooth and the rösti, or Swiss potato pancake, added good texture. I couldn't help but love the red and white check table napkins. It's only one of the details that make the place whole. A diner-style bar displays the ready-to-eat breakfast items like yogurt and muesli. The small room in the back seemed like the perfect place to rendezvous with someone while the chef's table in the kitchen would be a good place to get some friends together. The dungeon-like storage room behind the kitchen includes a mezzanine you can rent for a private party-what New Yorker doesn't like access to \"secret\" places?

Where to eat in Palisades Park, New Jersey: So Moon Nan Jip

Dave drove the group to Dae Ga on Lemoine Avenue in Fort Lee, New Jersey where it was dark and, well, out of business. We didn't have a Plan B even though the surrounding streets were peppered with Korean signs, so Dave called his brother-in-law who seemed to know all of the Korean bars and restaurants in the area. Without hesitation, he told us to keep driving to Palisades Park where it is now more Koreatown than Flushing, Queens and eat at So Moon Nan Jip. The place was buzzing at 6:30pm on a Sunday night but we only waited for five minutes before we were seated in the back under a silver hood. Banchans were laid out and the hot coals were brought out for our barbecue. We were enveloped in smoked as we hungrily ate the kalbi with steaming bowls of white rice and discussed what our last meals would be if we were in death row. (Lamb chops for the Dr.; my dad's Filipino sinigang for me) We also ordered the daegu muhri tang, a satisfying cod fish head stew. The bowl of naeng myun, or cold noodle soup, didn't pass Dave's test, but the grilled kalbi bones were a hit. A bottle of soju and OB beers were opened and shared. I don't go to New Jersey too much but now I have more reason to: Korean food across the George Washington bridge is so much better than the city's. So Moon Nan Jip is at 238 Broad Avenue in Palisades Park, New Jersey. Call them at 201/944.3998.

AWESOME post, thank you!! This is exactly what i needed to head into Fort Lee. I've been wanting to go for a while, but wasn't sure what places were recommended. I need a place that can compare to this food I had in Korea last year and am still missing terribly!! :(

I broke the strap of my goggles so swimming after work was out. What does one do on a Friday night alone? If you're me, then you'd also be on the 6 train to Grand Central Terminal to visit the new Murray's Real Salami store. Rob Kaufelt, the owner of Murray's Cheese, is now selling cooked and cured meats from artisan producers like Creminelli, Larchmont Charcuterie and Niman Ranch. The staff, though not like the Di Palo family members who can recite the history of a cheese or cured meat off the top of their heads, was helpful and excited about letting you try almost anything you want. The Creminelli sausage was perfectly salty with some spice in the end, while the $99-per pound Iberico de Bellota was naturally oily with some velvet in your mouth (must be all the acorns those happy pigs ate). Just try getting a sample of that at Despaña. The venison pate was superb with apricot and hazelnuts. The pheasant was rich and had pistachios. Both were perfect on their own or on fresh baguette. I ended up buying with everything I tasted except for the Iberico, plus some bresaola and cornichons. I also took home a bonus package of Niman Ranch bacon because I spent more than $25 during opening week. Across the aisle was Murray's Cheese where I picked up slivers of Ombra, Pecorino Ginepro and Le Chevre Noir. Back home, I saw no reason to stop: I opened a 2005 Chateauneuf du Pape bottle to go with everything. There should be more Friday nights like this. Murray's Real Salami is inside the Grand Central Market, 212/867.7202. They are open until 9pm during the week. Related post/s: Murray's Real Salami photos on Flickr

After a full week of craving salty foods, I woke up Sunday morning eager to bake something sweet. I'm not a big fan of too much sweet, though, so I opted for an easy apple cake recipe minus half a cup of sugar. When I took out the baking pans from the oven, I saw an old muffin pan I've only used a few times. From there, I just decided to make muffins instead of cake so I can transport them easier to work the next day. Ingredients: 1 red apple, peel on, chopped in small chunks 2 cups flour, sifted 1/2 cup brown sugar 2 eggs 1 cup buttermilk 1/4 cup butter, melted, plus a little extra to grease the muffin pan 1 tbsp baking powder 2 tsps cinnamon 1/2 tsp salt 1. Preheat the oven to 350º with the rack in the middle. Butter and flour a muffin pan. 2. Combine the flour, baking powder, cinnamon, sugar and salt in a large bowl. In a separate smaller bowl, whisk together the eggs and the buttermilk, and then the melted butter. 3. Pour the buttermilk mixture over the flour mixture. Fold in the apples. Stir until barely combined. Try not to over-mix so that it's not too sticky. 4. Spoon a small amount of batter into each muffin hole so that it's only halfway full. It will rise and will need the extra room later. Bake for about 15 minutes or until muffins are just set. Lower the oven temperature to 275º and bake for another 10 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean from a gentle poke. Turn off the oven and leave the muffins inside until the oven cools back down. The muffins will continue to cook in the remaining heat. Related post/s: Muffins with bacon! Day-old bread dessert

Funny how Korean food is my crutch cuisine after a night out of excessive drinking. If not a hot, spicy soup before going home, it's kimchi fried rice topped with a fried egg when I wake up. Korean food can lead you to too much drinking, but it sure does help you recover from it. A fried egg is perfect with this fried rice. When you crack the half-cooked yolk and let the yellow ooze over your rice, you'll forget about that banging headache, too. Mmm, I'm getting hungry just thinking about it. Ingredients: leftover cooked white rice kimchi 1 egg oil 1. In a heavy skillet, heat some oil and add rice. Fry and cook by stirring and tossing until the cold rice is warm and free of clumps. Add a small amount of kimchi and stir. The rice should be red-orange, but you don't want it to be too moist. I try not to add too much of the kimchi juice. Remove fried rice to a bowl. 2. Using the same skillet, heat some oil again and fry the egg. Serve on top of the fried rice.

12 East 22nd Street 212/228.7557 $90 for two, with 2 glasses of wine, with tip ♥ ♥ ♥ We've driven by Almoncello on Montauk Highway only to stop at Townline BBQ for lunch instead. This summer I told myself, okay, I'll definitely eat there next year. But now that their Manhattan branch has opened, I don't have to keep empty promises anymore. Closer to me is homey French bistro food good enough for a no-hassle night out with friends. After a stiff and stress-relieving dirty martini at the bar, my friend and I sat down and ravaged the appetizers list. We couldn't get enough of the fruits de mer with curried mussels, octopus and a delicious scallop and fennel ceviche. For $15 it was a steal, though I would gladly give the rest up for more of the ceviche. Almond excels at the duck confit. It was my favorite dish among the few that we ordered. The polenta ravioli and the mac and cheese were too rich for my taste, but that was probably because I was already at my limit after the frogs' legs with the puff pastry. My friend, whom I convinced to eat frogs' legs for the first time, loved them and went on raving about them to her husband when she got home. For a last-minute decision to eat out in the Murray Hill area, I think Almond is an economical and good choice. I doubt that it will be as empty in the weeks to come. Post to be updated as soon as my friend sends me the photos. Related post/s: Townline BBQ in Long Island Another economical choice in the area? Pamplona

It's probably not the right time to be posting recipes about ice cream, but I'm going to do it anyway because it's so easy if you have an ice cream maker. Now, to me an ice cream maker is one of those things you register for when you get married. I'm not on that path so I had to borrow one from someone who recently tied the knot. I must say that it will be my next purchase as soon as I have my own kitchen space. (Of course that's what I said before I got the three Le Creusets, the tagine and the bamboo steamer.) Sage came up as a possible pairing for our pumpkin-squash Supper theme last month. The herb itself is so fragrant that in ice cream form, it overpowered the cake and chips I wanted to match it with. In the end, we served a more subtle pumpkin ice cream to complete a last course we called Trio of Pumpkin, and now I have a whole tub of sage ice cream sitting in the freezer reserved for those quiet nights indoors. Ingredients: 2 cups heavy cream 2 cups half-and-half 1/3 cup fresh sage, coarsely chopped 4 large strips of lemon zest, peeled using a peeler 9 egg yolks 3/4 cup white sugar 1/4 tsp salt 1. In a heavy saucepan, bring cream, half-and-half, sage and zest to a boil over moderate heat. Remove from heat and cover the pot for 10 minutes. 2. Meanwhile, whisk together yolks, granulated sugar and salt in a large bowl. Pour in half of the hot cream and whisk to combine. Transfer to the saucepan to combine with the remaining hot cream. This is your custard. 3. Cook custard over moderate heat while stirring constantly with a wooden spoon. Do not let it boil. After about 5 minutes, the custard should be thick enough to cover the back of your spoon. 4. Pour custard through a fine sieve into a bowl and let cool in room temperature, stirring occasionally. Cover with Saran wrap and store in the refrigerator until cold, at least 1 hour. 5. Using an ice cream maker, pour in chilled custard and churn, following manufacturer's instructions. Mine took about 20 minutes. Scoop out of ice cream maker and transfer to a resealable plastic container and put in freezer to harden.

Wow! This recipe looks very tasty! Pretty strong though? Hmmm...I wonder if it would be better to tone down on the flavor or what dessert it would be good to pair it with! Thanks for the recipe...and it's always a good time of the year to post ice cream recipes!!!! Keep it up!

701 West 135th Street and Twelfth Avenue 212/491.8303 $104 for two, with 3 drinks, without tip ♥ ♥ If anyone in the restaurant industry deserves a break, it's King Phojanakong, owner and chef of Kuma Inn in the lower east side. I don't know if it's the Filipino-Thai upbringing that keeps him humble but I'm sure he's worked hard enough to keep Kuma Inn as unpretentious as possible. I believe that it's his time to shine with Talay, his new Asian-Latin restaurant in West Harlem with co-chef Phet Schwader. They couldn't have picked a better neighborhood, too. Harlem is going through some major changes and Talay joins the new Body Club next door and old favorites Dinosaur Bar-B-Que and Fairway Supermarket. Ignore the irritating name the real estate agents are trying to christen the area-ViVa for Viaduct Valley-and check out this micro-neighborhood as it transforms warehouses to nightclubs. We visited during a more sane Sunday night and sat at the bar in front of the kitchen to watch all the action. The green papaya beef salad was delicious and only made me salivate for more food. We loved the pork sausage spring rolls as well. We also ordered the octopus salad, a dish that I think caters to the few uptowners who want to be more adventurous. Talay does it pretty well. The summer roll had more vermicelli noodles than vegetables, but they cleansed the palate just in time for our blackened ahi tuna dish. With all the flavorful tastes in our mouths, the ahi tuna came out bland in comparison-we should have skipped it or at least ordered it first. There are some Latin-influenced dishes so as not to alienate the targeted crowd-arroz Valencia, ropa vieja, bistek churrasco-but the Asian dishes stick out and are among the tastiest. After dinner, I asked the maitre 'd to walk me upstairs to check out the party space. Talay is making up for what Kuma Inn lacked in space. There is bottle service and curtains can be drawn to keep a room more private-just the way the uptown and New Jersey crowd coming from across the bridge like it. While I don't think the downtown crowd will make the trek past 42nd Street, Talay is a good reason for the uptown crowd to stay uptown.

Ham Hock Xiao Long Bao with Butternut Burst

I wanted to accomplish two things with this version of the Shanghainese xiao long bao, or soup dumplings: make my own dumpling wrap from scratch and put a spin to it by using butternut squash soup for October's Supper with Strangers instead of the traditional stock made from pork skin and chicken broth. Although I was proud at making my first edibles ones without trying too hard, the soup didn't burst as much as I would have liked. But now that I know that I'm capable of making them, I'll take some other time to make the traditional version and make my Chinese friends proud. Allow yourself some extra time to make the butternut squash soup and the ham hock filling first and save the dumpling-making a couple of hours before serving. (I made a whole batch of soup and only used 2 cups for the xiao long bao.) For my first try, I kneaded the dough by hand, but for our Supper, I found a pasta maker extremely helpful in making the dough as thin and pliable as I needed it to be. A small 2-layer bamboo steamer in Chinatown is $10 and it can fit about ten xiao long baos. Ingredients: For the roasted butternut squash soup: 1 butternut squash, peeled, seeds removed, sliced in half 1 carrot, chopped 2 ribs of celery, chopped 1 yellow onion, chopped fresh thyme 1 tbsp powdered gelatin oil, salt, pepper 1. Make the butternut squash soup. Drizzle some oil on squash and season with thyme, salt and pepper. Roast squash in oven until tender, about 30 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool. When cool enough to handle, scoop out the squash meat to a bowl. 2. Combine carrot, celery and onion in a large stockpot with enough water to cover. Bring to a boil. Simmer until carrot is soft. Add the squash meat. Season with thyme, salt and pepper. Cook and stir occasionally while mashing some of the vegetables with the back of a wooden spoon. Remove from heat and let cool. 3. Start with a small batch of the squash mixture and puree in food processor. Return each batch to another stockpot and simmer again. Add more water to make a soup consistency. Season to taste. 4. Transfer 2 cups of the soup to a small saucepan for the xiao long bao. Add powdered gelatin and let sit for 2 minutes. Stir bring to a simmer. Remove from heat and let cool. Pour into a small ice cube tray and refrigerate until ready to make the xiao long baos. Serve the rest as a soup starter another day. For the ham hock: 3 smoked ham hocks, soaked in water overnight, then drained when ready to use 1 carrot, chopped 2 ribs of celery, chopped 1 red onion, chopped 3 bay leaves 1 small knob of ginger, peeled, thinly sliced 1 tsp soy sauce 1 tsp sesame oil 1. Make the ham hock filling. Combine ham hocks, carrot, celery, onion and bay leaves in a large stockpot with enough water to cover. Bring to a boil. Remove the impurities that rise to the top using a slotted spoon. Simmer for 2 to 3 hours or until the ham hocks are tender. When cooked, set the ham hocks aside and let cool. Discard the rest. 2. When cool enough to handle, remove the ham hock meat from the bones and roughly chop. In a small bowl, combine meat with ginger, soy sauce and sesame oil. Refrigerate until ready to make the xiao long baos. For the xiao long bao wrappers: 2 cups of flour, and more for your work surface 1/3 cup of hot water 2/3 cup of room temperature water 5 leaves of napa cabbage 1. Make the xiao long baos wrappers. Sift the flour into a large mixing bowl. Add the hot water and incorporate with your hands. Add the other 2/3 cup of water and mix to make dough. On a floured surface, use your hands to knead the dough for 10 minutes or until it becomes soft, smooth and bounces back slowly when you poke with your finger. Cover with plastic wrap and let it sit for 30 minutes. 2. Divide dough into 3 portions. Using one portion at a time while rest of the dough is covered in plastic wrap, roll into a snake. Chop the snaked dough in 1-inch pieces. Feed each inch into a pasta maker and roll out, using thickest setting first and moving on to the 2nd and then the 3rd, until the dough is thin but pliable enough. I made one wrapper and assembled a xiao long bao one at a time to keep the dough from drying up. 3. Assemble the xiao long baos. Fill each wrapper with 1 tbsp of ham hock filling and a cube of butternut squash soup gelatin. Pinch and pleat the edges of the wrapper and twist to seal. Set assembled ones in a large bowl covered with a wet paper towel to keep moist until ready to steam. 4. Boil a large pot of water. Line each layer of the bamboo steamer with napa cabbage leaves. Place a few xiao long baos on each layer, cover and put on top of the pot of boiling water to steam for 10 to 15 minutes. They are cooked when translucent and moist.

4th floor of the Time Warner Center, 10 Columbus Circle at 60th Street 212/823.9335 $900 for two, with drinks, with extra tip apart from the included service fee ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ As soon as our waiter brought out a footstool for my purse so that I didn't have to put it down on the floor, I knew we were in for an experience. Small gestures like that from the staff make Per Se, and any of Thomas Keller's restaurants, stand out. Everyone around us was older or part of a group that discussed important business, but we were treated like we belonged there. We never felt awkward-except when we tried to push those gorgeous blue doors open-nor rushed. Our waiters and servers weren't snotty and our sommelier was helpful in suggesting wines to match our dishes without necessarily pushing for the bottles that were out of our budget. I was treating the Dr. for his birthday and when I made the reservation exactly two months ago, they had asked me if there was an occasion. That night, they included a \"Happy Birthday [Dr.]\" right below the date on our menus. It was a simple gesture, but it made the celebrant very appreciative. When desserts were brought out, a lit candle was placed on his and they joked about singing a capella. (For a few seconds, I really thought they would.) Upon our leaving, another staff member was waiting for us at the door with our coats, our mignardises packed in a silver box and a folder with copies of our menu. After almost five hours of being treated like royalty, we stepped out of Per Se's luxurious setting and back into the concrete jungle that is New York City. I'm grateful for those few hours.

A drive up to Massachusetts to visit old friends and see the foliage was canceled at the last minute after the Dr. was called in to work. He made up for it by changing the car reservations and driving us closer from the city and letting me drag him to Stuart's Farm's apple orchard and pumpkin patch. The apples were still out, but there was no picking that needed to be done to the pumpkins-you can just \"pick\" one from the batch the farmers had already selected. The drive was beautiful though. We both gasped when we saw the colors of the leaves while driving over Croton Point Park. The water was as still along the reservoir. It was definitely fall and the night called for us to test the squashes we brought home with us. Use wild rice instead of orzo if you want this dish to be heftier. Ingredients: a small acorn squash, halved, seeded and cut into small chunks 1 apple, cored, halved, sliced 1 small sweet potato, peeled, cut into small chunks a handful of shallots, peeled 1 cup of orzo a handful of cilantro, finely chopped a dollop of honey lime juice oil, salt, pepper 1. Toss the squash, potato and shallots in a large bowl with a splash of oil, salt and pepper. Turn out onto a large baking pan. Roast for about 30 minutes. Then remove from oven and add the apples. Using tongs, slip the squash and potatoes to make sure the other sides are browning, too. Roast for another 10. The squash and potatoes should be tender and the onions caramelized. 2. In the meantime, cook the orzo. Boil some water and cook the orzo for about 10 minutes. Drain and fluff with a fork to avoid sticking. Set aside until ready to assemble the dish. 3. In the meantime, make the dressing. In a small bowl, combine some olive oil, cilantro, honey and some lime juice. You might need to drop in a splash of warm water or two to dilute the honey. Season with salt and pepper. 4. To assemble everything, use a large bowl and toss roasted vegetables together with the orzo and the cilantro-lime dressing. I use my hands to make sure that the vegetables are evenly distributed. Related post/s: Part of my Mother Hen project: omakase bento #22 For warmer months, orzo is great with citrus

Most vegetable soups are thin and clean. I wanted to add some texture to this so I added rice to the carrot-ginger batch before pureeing it in the blender. The final result felt like oatmeal in my mouth and a flavorful soup that was heartier than usual. Ingredients: 2 large carrots, peeled, chopped in large chunks 1 small- to medium-sized ginger, peeled, chopped 1/4 cup of rice 3 cloves of garlic, minced 1 red onion, roughly chopped 6 sprigs of thyme a handful of parsley, roughly chopped 3 bay leaves oil, salt, pepper 1. In a stockpot, heat some olive oil over medium heat. Saute garlic until slightly brown. Add onions and cook until soft, but do not brown. Add ginger, parsley, thyme and bay leaves and cook until fragrant, about 2-3 minutes. 2. Add carrots, rice and 3 cups of water. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer until carrots are exceedingly tender, about 30 minutes. Stir occasionally to help cook the rice. Turn off heat and set aside to cool. 3. When cool, remove bay and discard bay leaves. Puree soup in blender in batches. Season with salt and pepper.

If you add a bit of lime juice, this makes a really nice chilled soup. I know it is not exactly the time of year for it, but I thought you might like the idea.

Second floor, Whole Foods Market 95 East Houston Street corner of Bowery $20 all you can eat sushi, without tip ♥ I didn't expect high quality sushi when I saw the sign for all you can eat sushi for $20 at Whole Foods on Bowery, but I was curious enough to pull two co-workers with me to try out Sushiya's latest promotion. We dodged the long lines at street level and propped ourselves up the bar stools in front of the conveyor belt sushi bar. At Sushiya, what you see is what you get, and we got a lot of rice. There were some tuna, eel and salmon; some roe and a torn piece of arugula on a maki; crab and shrimp on spiced onigiris; seaweed salad, edamame and the out-of-place Vietnamese summer rolls. The makis came more often than the sushis, though the servers behind the bar quickly made them whenever we requested. We had the bar to ourselves when we visited and yet they always replaced the plates at the other end of the belt-perhaps to try and slow us down from eating all their inventory. In the end, we counted about thirty empty plates which is about 20 pieces per person for a total of $60. Oh, I think I just threw up a little in my mouth. All in all, $20 is pricey for lunch even around the East Village and SoHo, but it's quite fun to wait for the colorful plates to come your way and pick sushi, makis and onigiris from the magnetic conveyor belt.

Have you seen that Anthony Bourdain episode shot in Seoul? I caught a rerun over the weekend and I salivated during the part when they ate a hot spicy soup with noodles after arriving in the country all jet-lagged and grouchy. He said it immediately made him feel better. After two weeks of drinking almost everyday, I needed to recuperate, too. The Dr. said I made a chigae, or a soup, but because of all the vegetables I happily tossed in, I made a chungol or a hotpot with noodles. I'm sure his mother won't approve that I bastardize a soup she can make with her eyes closed, but I liked how my hearty version turned out. It immediately made me feel better. When reheating leftovers-oh, there will be plenty-add a small amount of water and another tablespoon of kochujang sauce. Ingredients: a handful of Korean dduk a fistful of glass noodles 1 green bell pepper, seeded, chopped 2 eggplants, chopped in thick rounds only before adding to the pot 2 small potatoes, peeled, chopped 1 bunch of scallions, chopped in 1/2-inch pieces 4 tbsps kochujang, or Korean red pepper paste ginger-garlic paste 1 tbsp peanut oil salt 1. In a large Dutch oven, heat the peanut oil. Add the ginger-garlic paste and scallions. Saute and avoid burning the paste. Add the chopped eggplants and bell pepper. Toss and cook until they are half-cooked. 2. In the meantime, bowl some water in a small pot and cook the dduk for 7 minutes. Drain and set aside. 3. Back to the large pot of vegetables, add 3 cups of water and stir in the kochujang. Add the dduk and the potatoes. Lower the heat and simmer for 10 minutes. Season with salt. 4. Remove pot from heat and stir in the noodles. The noodles will cook in the soup's remaining heat. Serve immediately with rice.

Lamb Stew with Corn

Oh my goodness, I thought, as I caught a whiff of the lamb stew that had been simmering for almost three hours. I've been copying the Dr. in the kitchen lately and it was no different last night. After spending a nice weekend hiking outside and walking around the city, I was ready to sit in front of Mad Men and sulk with a warm bowl of stew on my lap. After he told me he was making lamb stew for dinner, I knew I had to do the same. It would have been better if I just watched him cook for us, but I wanted to do my own version and compete. The idea of adding corn came from a Mexican tripe stew we bought last week in east Harlem after a late night out. I think mine had a good chance of winning. Ingredients: 1 1/2 pounds of lamb chuck chops 1 corn on the cob, chopped in 4 pieces 2 cups of red wine 2 cups of vegetable broth a handful of parsley, chopped 2 sprigs of thyme 2 sprigs of mint 2 cloves of garlic, minced 1 red onion, chopped 2 tbsps paprika 2 bay leaves oil, salt, pepper 1. Season lamb chuck chops with salt and pepper. In a large Dutch oven, add some oil and brown all sides of the lamb. Remove from the pot and set aside. 2. Remove all but 2 tablespoons of the used oil. Try to get the darkest bits out from the oil. In the remaining oil, saute the garlic until light brown and the onions until soft. Add the paprika, thyme, parsley and bay leaves. 3. Return the browned lamb in the pot and add the red wine. Let boil and then lower the heat to simmer for 20 minutes or until the red wine has reduced. Stir in broth, cover the pot and simmer for up to 3 hours. 4. After 1 hour, add the corn. After the next hour, turn the corn just to make sure the other ends get some brown sauce in them, too. The meat should be falling off the bone by the third hour. Remove pot from heat, uncover and stir in mint leaves.

We're in a recession, right? Even the Swai fish price in Harlem is up a few dollars. For last week's bento lunch, I used pork because buying for ten people was still under budget compared to buying enough fish that would feed the entire group. This week, I used chicken-and you know something's off when I start buying chicken. I rarely order chicken from a restaurant menu (except for a good fried chicken, of course), but I do like cooking with it. I'm a sucker for the Dr.'s roast chicken anytime. So with six chicken breasts and almost two pounds of peppers from my last few farmer's shares, I turned to the Filipino cookbook I bought in Manila last August called Fiesta! Fiesta! Festival Foods of the Philippines for a tomato and bell pepper-based stew. The recipe's most important step called for a store-bought Afritada mix (wenk, wenk) which I obviously altered in my version. Why go for a short cut when the real way is already easy? Ingredients: 6 boneless chicken breasts 4 large red bell peppers, seeded, chopped 2 tomatoes, chopped 1 tbsp tomato paste 2 bay leaves 1 onion, chopped 2 garlic cloves, minced oil, salt, pepper 1. In a large Dutch oven, heat some oil and brown chicken on both sides. Remove from pot and set aside. 2. Using the same pot and oil, saute garlic until brown and onions until soft. Add the bay leaves and stir in tomato paste. Add tomatoes and bell peppers and cook until peppers are tender. 3. Add the chicken pieces back and add 4 cups of water. Lower the heat and simmer for 1 hour or until chicken is cooked and water is reduced to a thicker consistency.

I hurried home on Sunday afternoon because I was in the mood to spend the rest of my weekend cooking. The Dr. bought fresh perilla leaves from Koreatown before we left for Montauk in preparation for all the sashimi that we were going to eat after a planned fishing trip for striped bass. We didn't catch any fish that weekend (neither did anyone on the entire boat), so he saved the leaves to use it for something else. His kalbi tang, or Korean beef rib soup, last Tuesday was so comforting that I badly wanted to recreate it at home. It reminded me of the Filipino bulalo, or bone marrow soup, only less fatty. Browning the short ribs made the stock beefier and toastier. The perilla leaves added an interesting kick to it-I don't know how else to describe the taste but medicinal. And really, after a pot of this soup with some warm white rice and kimchi, you'd feel a hundred per cent better already. Ingredients: 6 pieces of beef short ribs 1 napa cabbage, chopped 10 pieces perilla leaves 2 tbsps soy bean paste 1 red onion, chopped 2 cloves of garlic, minced oil 1. In a large Dutch oven, add some oil and brown all sides of the beef ribs. Remove from the pot and set aside. 2. Remove all but 2 tablespoons of the used oil. Try to get the darkest bits out from the oil. In the remaining oil, saute the garlic until light brown and the onions until soft. Add the soy bean paste and stir. 3. Return the browned beef ribs in the pot and add 5 to 6 cups of water. Cover and simmer for about 2 to 3 hours. Check after 20 minutes to remove the impurities that float to the top. It's okay if you discard some of the onions. 4. When the meat is almost falling off the bone, add cabbage and perilla leaves. Cook for another 10 minutes or until cabbage is tender. Season with some more soy bean paste if it needs extra salt. Related post/s: I get my Korean ingredients at Han Ah Reum in midtown I made a cleaner Korean soup with dumplings before

I can tell that the cold weather is here to stay with the most recent bounty from my CSA farmer share. Solid and heavy produce like apples, carrots, turnips and broccoli dominated the weight of my two carry-ons. I still have a jar of homemade kimchi in the fridge so I wanted to do something different yet familiar with the turnips. I turned to my copy of Monisha Bharadwaj's India's Vegetarian Cooking to try her spiced turnips recipe after I remembered doing a similar take on kohlrabi. Ingredients: 4 medium turnips, peeled, chopped 1 large tomato, chopped 1 small onion, sliced 2 tbsps ginger-garlic paste 1 tsp cumin 1 tsp fennel seeds 1/2 tsp turmeric 1/2 tsp red chili flakes a small handful of cilantro leaves, finely chopped oil, salt 1. Heat some oil in a pot and saute the onions until soft. Add the ginger-garlic paste and the chili flakes. Add the tomatoes and all the spices. Season with a little salt. Stir until well blended. 2. Mix in the turnips and add about 3/4 cup of water. Stir to combine everything. Cover and bring to a boil and then reduce heat to simmer for about 15 minutes or until turnips are tender. 3. Remove from heat and add in the cilantro leaves. Related post/s: I use a similar recipe using kohlrabi

When trying to figure out our September apple menu for Supper with Strangers, I naturally turned to pork because pork and apples make a good combination. A more recent New York Times recipe featured duck and figs that looked very autumnal and just made me feel warm and fuzzy all over. Duck breast was out of our Supper budget, so I found some nice pork loin and stole the idea of figs from the recipe. The apple peel brine came from watching the Dr. marinate pork chops when we closed the summer season in Montauk a couple of weekends ago. The sweetness of the brine penetrated the pork meat and made it juicy; cooked just right and the meat is succulent and moist. The baked apples and figs were a nice side to make the meal complete. A Coast of Spain blend of Cabernet, Merlot and Tempranillo was the perfect match. Ingredients: 1 pork loin, tied in butcher twine 1 apple, sliced thin 1 apple, peel and meat peeled using a peeler 1 small tub of figs, sliced in half 3 tbsps sugar 1 tbsp juniper berries 1 tsp all spice 1 tsp black peppercorns 3 bay leaves oil, salt 1. Two days before cooking, make the brine. In a small saucepan, boil apple peels and meat with sugar, juniper berries, all spice, black peppercorns, bay leaves in 4 cups of water. Season with salt. Simmer until water is reduced to about half. Remove pot from heat and let completely cool before adding to pork loin. 2. In a glass baking dish, marinade the pork loin in the brine. Just use enough brine to submerge the pork almost halfway. Turn pork loin over after a day. 3. When ready to cook, preheat oven to 300º. While preheating oven, remove pork from the brine. Heat a large skillet with some oil and brown the pork loin on all sides. Transfer to a baking sheet lined with foil and roast for about 25 minutes or until the pork feels like the meat below your thumb. 4. In the meantime, combine figs and apples in a separate baking dish and drizzle some oil. Bake for 15 minutes. Set aside. Save the juice. 5. Remove pork loin from oven to a chopping block and let rest for about 15 minutes before slicing into 2-inch thick rounds. Serve with baked apples and figs and drizzle the fruit juice over them.

110 East 7th Street between First Avenue and Avenue A 212/777.2151 $9 for a pork sandwich, without tip ♥ For Italians, porchetta means boneless pork roast that's moist and juicy. Chef and co-owner Sara Jenkins doesn't stray away from that definition: my $9 pork was no joke. The meat was shiny; its own fat glistening in between the two slices of Sullivan Street Bakery ciabatta bread. There are little surprises of crunch and soft gelatinous cubes of fat-my jaw hurt from chewing but I couldn't stop eating. I'll return to try it with some of my own chili sauce, although it was well-seasoned that it didn't really need any extras to make it more satisfying than it already is. The $5 side of potatoes were roasted in pork fat and tossed with some burnt pork ends. The bitter and garlicky broccoli rabe was a good balance to all the fat. It took me ten minutes to walk from work to this new Porchetta branch in the east Village and another five to get my lunch order, but it took me two hours to digest one of their fatty-licious sandwiches.

When I try to cook something and it comes out of the oven fragrant and then it actually tastes good, I always wish I baked more. I got my hands on some ripe and bruised peaches today. I knew they wouldn't hold even if I just ate them with yogurt for breakfast, so I thought cooking them was the way to go. I've tried this recipe before and for some reason I added more flour and it came out bread-y. This time, I was vigilant about following the measurements and waiting for it to bake on its own. Spain...On The Road Again on CBS kept me company until I had to eat a piece of Cia dessert. Ingredients: 8 ripe yellow peaches, peeled, pitted, and sliced into 1/2 inch thick wedges 1 cup sugar, divided 2/3 cup and 1/3 cup 1 tsp grated lemon peel 1 1/2 tbsps lemon juice 2 tsps vanilla 2 cups all purpose flour 1 1/4 tsps baking powder 1/2 tsp ground nutmeg 3/4 cup (6 oz) butter, cut into 1/2 inch chunks 2/3 cup whipping cream 1. Preheat oven to 350º. In a large bowl, combine peaches, 2/3 cup sugar, lemon peel, lemon juice and vanilla. Let stand at least 15 minutes, stirring several times. 2. In another large bowl, combine flour with remaining 1/3 cup sugar, baking powder and nutmeg. Using your fingers, incorporate butter into flour mixture until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Add cream and stir just until dough holds together. 3. In a greased shallow square baking dish, spread fruit at the bottom. Using your hands, crumble dough evenly over fruit. 4. Bake oven until fruit mixture bubbles in center and topping is golden brown, about 1 hour.

I'm spending the last weekend of the summer in Montauk and I wanted to make a salad last night that evoked that warm-but-chilly late afternoon air. We opened a bottle of wine and divided the duties in the kitchen: the Dr. cranked up the grill while I stayed indoors to prepare the side dishes. Earlier in the day, we stopped by the Amagansett vegetable stand to buy fresh produce. I was inspired by the fresh mozarella and the fragrant melons, as well as the spicy arugula and extra large parsley leaves. A quick stop at the deli got me some prosciutto to add. Ingredients: a small chunk of a melon, sliced in slightly larger pieces than the mozarella a few pieces of prosciutto, torn fresh mozarella, sliced in small pieces a handful of parsley, roughly chopped a handful of arugula, roughly chopped juice from half a lemon oil, salt, pepper 1. In a small bowl, make the dressing. Whisk in lemon juice with the olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Set aside. 2. In a salad bowl, toss in the melon cubes with the mozarella. Add in prosciutto and the greens. Gently dress with lemon juice and olive oil mixture so that the salad doesn't muddle. Related post/s: Try bresaola if you don't like pork

Soondooboo chigae, or soft tofu stew, is usually made with minced pork or clams and then flavored with garlic, scallions, sesame oil and the ubiquitous red pepper powder. Everything is boiled over intense heat using a ceramic pot that doubles as a serving a bowl. Raw eggs are served with it so that you may plop one in to add to the broth's consistency. If you ask Koreans where to get the best soondooboo in Los Angeles, I would be surprised if they didn't say So Kong Dong on West Olympic. I'm still not sure if the two restaurants are related; I'm just glad we have one in the east coast. So Kong Dong is at 130 Main Street in Fort Lee, New Jersey. You can't reserve a table and there's a bit of a wait on weekends, but you can call 201/242.0026 and order ahead for pick-up.

I couldn't ignore the beautiful photograph that accompanied Amanda Hesser's recreation of a 1948 tomato preserve recipe in The New York Times Magazine last month. I cut the recipe short and marinated the tomatoes in sugar for only a few hours instead of overnight. I didn't seed the tomatoes either, nor did I remove the lemon slices when I stored the finished product in a glass jar. My version still came out nice enough to spread in toasted baguettes and crackers. Ingredients: 8 plum tomatoes 3/4 cup sugar 3 cloves 1 stick cinnamon a small knob of ginger, peeled, sliced 1/4 of a lemon, thinly sliced, seeded 1. Boil some water in a small pot. Skin tomatoes by cutting a shallow X in their rounded end. Add tomatoes in the boiling water for 30 seconds. Remove the tomatoes using a slotted spoon and let cool. When cool enough to handle, peel off tomato skins. 2. Layer the tomatoes and sugar in a small Dutch oven. Cover and refrigerate for a couple of hours. 3. When ready to cook, put all the spices in a cheesecloth and add to the tomatoes along with the sliced lemon. Place over medium heat and bring to a simmer. Cook, stirring and gently crushing often, until the tomatoes have become slightly translucent and the syrup is thick and begins to gel. Don't boil the syrup, or the tomatoes will fall apart. 4. Remove the spice bag. Remove Dutch oven from heat and let tomato preserve cool before transferring to a resealable glass jar. Related post/s: Tomatillos are related to tomatoes

163 First Avenue off 10th Street https://reservations.momofuku.com/ about $300 for two, with beverage pairings, without tip ♥ ♥ ♥ I was so busy at work last week that I didn't even have time to be excited about our upcoming reservations at Ko. When Cameron told me she wanted to take me out to thank me for showing her the Philippines last month, I thought, You're welcome; don't be silly. But when I received an email from her a couple of weeks later with our Ko confirmation attached, I squealed, Noooooo. I gave up trying to get a reservation the first time I actually saw a green check mark on their Web site. As soon as I clicked it, I waited nervously for the page to refresh, and then, Sorry, that spot was just taken. It's like waiting for your lottery numbers to show up on TV: the ball rolls out and you think it's one of your picks; only it's a 6 and not a 9 when it finally stops spinning. Momofuku Ko is the first restaurant I know of that uses only a Web site to take reservations and I suppose it's a good way to keep the die-hard David Chang fans excited. All of us need someone who is willing to click their mouse off once in a while. At 6:15 sharp, we were seated in the middle of the bar with a couple to our left and a group of four at the other end. The other seats were waiting for the 6:30pm guests-stacking them up this way is their version of turning tables over efficiently. By the time we were eating our fourth course, a newly arrived couple to our right was pouring over the wine list. The night's pace was swift; our matching wines, beer and sake kept coming until the first of two desserts. I felt like I had to keep drinking to have no more than two glasses on my table. Although I played catch up with my drinks, I kept up with all eleven courses, including the bouches. The portions weren't French Laundry nor Blue Hill sizes. I wasn't comatose at the end of our two-hour meal. Perhaps a little tipsy, but quite happy and content. Here's a rundown: 1. A delicately small toasted English muffin with pork fat and chives 2. A Ssam tribute of pig's head torchon with mustard One of the first two came with a light and crunchy chicharron and Japanese salt. 3. Fluke sashimi in buttermilk (!) with Sriracha hot sauce and yuzu paste covered in poppy seeds 4. Matsutake mushrooms in hot broth of bacon and dashi, a dish that reminded me of Tojo's sable fish soup in Vancouver. 5. A beautifully smoked soft-boiled egg with onion sous-vide and caviar served with potato chips 6. An out of place corn-filled ravioli with Cotija Mexican cheese; I liked it more than I expected. 7. Maine halibut in pepperoncini puree and burnt onions with finely-chopped kohlrabi and radish in basil oil 8. Lychee with Riesling gelee and pine nuts and then covered in grated foie gras. Grated. Foie. Gras. This dish blew me away and I couldn't stop talking about it. Everything melded in my mouth like Dippin' Dots, only more luxurious and decadent than anything I've had this year. \"Son of a peach\" indeed. 9. Perfectly, perfectly cooked duck-the surly Asian man behind the counter (who wasn't David Chang) had skills-with Chinese long beans, chestnuts and bean sprouts in cherry sauce. 10. Lychee sorbet in sesame \"sand\"; my quotes but perhaps a Thomas Keller-influenced naming convention 11. Strawberry and peanut butter halva with a sickeningly sweet yellow cake ice cream. I told you, I don't like sweets. David Chang is so lucky to be the name on almost every foodie's tongue today: five years in the east Village and he's still making waves. Ko is obviously his and his staff's playground and you can feel that they're cooking for themselves and serving what they want because they know people will follow. I can't help but feel proud that this Asian American is at the top of his career right now. How I wish all talented and deserving chefs out there get the same chance to cook and perform the Momofuku way.

It felt great to be cooking in the kitchen again. After a summer hiatus, I signed the usual group up again for my omakase bento lunches. A day out in New Jersey playing $40 buy-in volleyball with some friends got me a slightly twisted ankle, so I couldn't really stand too long to cook something elaborate. I did most of the work here sitting down. My legs also hurt from too much exercise in one day, so I ended up using my entire CSA share from last Thursday instead of going out to shop for more ingredients. Ask any non-Filipino out there about Filipino food and they'll most likely tell you about lumpiang Shanghai, or the fried egg rolls we adapted from the Chinese. Like any traditional recipe, this not only involves a lot of preparation, but also an almost precise way of frying to get them crispy. Wrapping them is a whole other business I've learned from my mother and from rolling other things-it takes practice. To cut down on chopping and cooking time, I used a peeler to get the vegetable meat as thin as possible. When ready to serve, all I had to do was fry them in medium-low heat to brown the wrapper since everything inside is already cooked. You can make these ahead of time and they keep in the freezer, stored in a Tupperware, for up to two weeks. You can find spring roll wrappers or \"shells\" in the frozen section of any Asian grocery store. I like the Wei-Chuan brand because they're springy enough to make the rolling easy, but also thin enough to brown quicker. Ingredients: spring roll wrappers, thawed and kept moist by covering with a wet paper towel while wrapping 1 pound of green beans, stringed, finely chopped 2 medium carrots, peeled, and then shaved using a peeler 2 kohlrabis, peeled, and then shaved using a peeler 2 potatoes, half-boiled, peeled, and then shaved using a peeler 1 red bell pepper, seeded, finely chopped 3 cloves of garlic, minced red pepper flakes oil, salt, pepper 1. Heat some oil in a large skillet. Saute the garlic until light brown. Saute all the vegetables, adding the ones that take longer to cook. In this case, green beans first, then kohlrabi, followed by the carrots and the red bell pepper. Add in the cooked potatoes 2 minutes before turning the heat off. Season with chili flakes, salt and pepper. Set aside. 2. Wrap and roll. On a chopping block, lay out one of the wrappers flat. Spoon a little bit of the vegetable mix onto the bottom end of the wrapper. Fold that end over to cover the stuffing and then fold half an inch from the left and the right over to seal the sides. Continue to fold over the bottom until you make a roll. Set aside with the opening side down to keep it closed until ready to fry. Do this until you're out of vegetable mixture or wrappers. 3. When ready to fry, heat some oil in a shallow skillet. When oil is almost smoking, slowly add each roll to fry with the opening side down to keep them closed. Using tongs, gently turn each roll over to cook the other side. Both sides should only be a lightly toasted color. 4. Remove each roll to a stainless steel colander. They will sweat and lose crispiness if you put them on paper towel right away. Related post/s: Part of my Mother Hen project: omakase bento #16

Tomato- and Ricotta-Stuffed Squash Blossoms

I've stuffed goat cheese in squash blossoms before but we want to be more creative and adventurous with our Supper with Strangers. When Cameron and I sit down (and drink) to plan our monthly menu, we immediately think of the more well known dishes and try to cross them off our list. When we came up with August's tomato theme, I begged that please, please, no caprese salad. We could have saved squash blossoms for autumn but a light, almost foamy texture with a thin crisp of a vegetable flower, was just perfect to start off a summer meal. I tried this recipe the only way I know how: coating the blossoms with flour before frying. But the flour only weighed down the delicate blossoms so I ended up skipping the batter. One of those Asian strainer ladles is useful to fry them quickly and remove them from the hot oil. Ingredients: 12 fresh squash blossoms, stamens removed 5 tbsps ricotta 1 heirloom yellow or orange tomato, pulped removed and set aside, diced juice from a small lemon oil, salt, pepper 1. In a small bowl, combine ricotta and tomatoes. Season with salt and pepper. 2. Gently stuff the squash blossoms by spooning half a dollop of the ricotta-tomato mixture inside. Do not overstuff. Lightly twist the blossom ends to shut close. 3. When ready to fry, heat some oil in a deep skillet. Before the oil starts to smoke, Fry up to 3 blossoms at a time using a strainer ladle. Try to swish the pot so that the entire blossom gets some of the hot oil. When they start to brown, remove to a stainless steel colander. They will sweat and lose crispiness if you put them on paper towel right away. When cool enough to handle, then you can transfer them to a plate lined with paper towel until ready to serve. 4. Serve with some of the tomato pulp and season with salt, pepper and a squirt of lemon juice.

306-308 East 6th Street on Second Avenue 212/979.8787 about $200 for five, without drinks, without tip ♥ I've never heard of phaal until it made the Omnivore's Hundred from verygoodtaste.co.uk. From that site's must-eat list, I checked off 75 items that I've tasted and eaten. Among the other 25 is phaal, or phall, a South Indian curry dish that is supposedly spicier than the more familiar vindaloo. I was intrigued. My co-workers wanted to order lunch delivery and Brick Lane Curry House's menu satisfied the meat eaters plus the vegan and vegetarians among us. It took about an hour for the food to come and when we opened the lids of the containers, I have to admit I was very disappointed at the small amount of food. The lamb chops, infused with tamarind, ginger and garlic, while tender and tasty, were small and didn't hold up to my growling stomach. I had to compensate by eating extra portions of rice. I only had a small taste of the vegetarian and the vegan curries, and I couldn't tell the difference from the two sauces except for the fact that the vegan version had a smattering of white onions. The Goan fish dish was the best in the mix with its green chiles and coconut flavor enhanced by vinegar. Was it buttery? Oh, yes, it was. Now back to the phaal, exaggerated by the restaurant as an \"excruciatingly hot curry\" but correctly described as \"more pain and sweat than flavor\". Need to know more than that? When the sauce hits your tongue, you get the sting right away and then it sits and slowly burrows. (Un)fortunately, as soon as your tongue goes numb, the spiciness is replaced by bitterness, and at that point, all you want is either some more rice or more Goan fish curry. Michael above, though, talks about how it hit his sinus right away; he didn't even feel the spiciness in his tongue. I've had my share of spicy food, and up to this day, nothing beats the pickled Scotch Bonnet peppers I had in the Big Corn Island in Nicaragua. Go taste the phaal for yourself at Brick Lane Curry House and get a free bottle of beer when you finish a whole serving on your own.

Paella seems to be in the news lately. Mark Bittman featured this vegetarian-friendly recipe a few weeks ago and I took note to recreate it for our August Supper with Strangers. Over the long weekend, a grilled version was featured in the Sunday Times Magazine. I had time to test Bittman's recipe, but I found it hard to cook the rice in under 30 minutes. I tried his way the first round using the oven but some parts remained undercooked. I felt like there was so much maintenance to make sure the rice was evenly cooked. For my second try, I left it on top of the stove but it still needed so much attention I just had no patience for it. So for Supper, I committed the worst paella sin there could be and used a rice cooker to make sure the dish went well for six guests. It did: the rice was fluffy, not sticky, and I didn't have to keep adding vegetable broth. The initial few cups I used kept it cooking with just a simmer. It's almost blasphemous, I know, but the paella turned out well. I grilled some lamb chorizo to go with the dish and some thinly-sliced aubergines as a vegetarian alternate. I topped both versions with grilled tomato slices and poured over salted tomato pulp to make it moist. Ingredients: 4 cups of short-grain rice 1 pack of vegetable broth 1 large heirloom tomato, thinly sliced 1 onion, finely chopped 2 cloves of garlic, minced 2 tbsps paprika 1 tbsp tomato paste half a bunch of parsley, finely chopped oil, salt, pepper If using: 1 eggplant, thinly sliced, seasoned with salt and pepper, grilled 1 rope of lamb chorizo, grilled, and then sliced 1. Heat a skillet and add some oil. Saute garlic until golden brown. Add onions and cook until translucent. Season with salt and pepper. Stir in tomato paste and paprika and cook for another minute. Add rice, stirring constantly, making sure everything is well-combined. 2. Transfer everything to a rice cooker and add vegetable broth. Cook like you do white rice. 3. Five minutes from being done, when the rice has settled but there is still some broth simmering, top with tomato slices to cook in the remaining steam. 4. When cooked, turn off the rice cooker, stir the rice and sprinkle with parsley. Let sit in the cooker until ready to serve. Served with grilled chorizo or eggplants.

81 Lexington Avenue corner of 26th Street 212/684.7755 about $45, with one drink, with tip ♥ The Dr. remembered a suggestion he received from one of his co-workers for some dosas in Murray Hill but the name escaped him; all he knew was that it was long and unpronounceable. Luckily we caught a glimpse of Saravanaa Bhavan's sign as soon as we turned the corner on Lexington Avenue. I wanted something new and I decided on two dishes I've never heard before after scanning the menu. (The Dr. stuck with the more familiar vegetarian dosa.) The adai avail reminded me of the hard work I put into making my own chataamari, grinding the lentils by hand using a simple mortar and pestle while watching TV. It was pasty but the texture was still grainy: unmistakably homemade. The onions were apparent in the kaima idli, and I couldn't stop eating. The spiciness also lingered after several spoonfuls. I slathered it with the raita, the yogurt-based dip, to keep it together. I found a new favorite and I was addicted. The salted lassi wasn't exactly the best match but I just had to try it and cross it off my recent must-try list. Go to Saravanaa Bhavan if you want to stray away from the usual curries and if you don't feel like paying double at SoHo's Hampton Chutney. The scene is a New York City one, full of family life and color. Related post/s: Nepalese Stuffed Chataamari recipe Chinese Mirch is down the block

Sometimes, the best part of leaving filthy New York City is coming home to it. A day after I returned, I picked up my latest farmer's share and got back in the groove of cooking again. In the Philippines, all the food we ate was done for us whether it was from a restaurant, from a street vendor or from one of my many relatives who cooked us a meal. When I picked up my share of scallions and green peppers, I thought of a stir-fry dish that would be easy to make for my first dinner back. I was eating a lot of pork while I was in the Philippines so it wasn't weird when I wanted to eat something with chicken. I had already gotten the sushi out of the way my first night back-my way of cleansing my system after returning from a vacation-and a quick toss of greens with breast fillets was a no-brainer as a next step towards getting back to my routine. I marinated the chicken here overnight, but you can certainly spend less time and just marinate while you chop the rest of the ingredients. I also skipped the peanuts and used sherry vinegar instead of Chinese vinegar for the sauce and that's why my version is paler than the traditional one. You can use balsamic vinegar as well to get that dark color. Ingredients: 2 lbs boneless chicken breasts, without skin, sliced in smaller pieces 1 green bell pepper, seeded, chopped 4 scallions, white parts only, chopped 4 garlic cloves a small knob of ginger, peeled, thinly sliced 3 Thai chiles, seeded 1 tsp whole Sichuan pepper a handful of roasted unsalted peanuts (optional) peanut oil For the marinade: 2 tbsps light soy sauce 2 tbsps rice wine 2 tbsps cornstarch 1 tbsp water salt For the sauce: 3 tbsps sugar 1 tbsp dark soy sauce 1 tbsp light soy sauce 3 tbsps sherry vinegar 1 tsp sesame oil 1 tbsp water 1. Combine all the ingredients for the marinade in a large container with the chicken pieces. Mix well and set aside in the fridge until ready to cook. 2. Combine the sauce ingredients in a small bowl. Set aside. 3. Using a large skillet, add some peanut oil and heat over a high flame. When the oil is hot but not yet smoking, add the chiles and Sichuan pepper and stir-fry briefly until they are crisp and the oil is spicy and fragrant. Try not to burn them. 4. Add the chicken and the bell pepper and fry over a high flame, stirring constantly. As soon as the chicken pieces have separated, add the ginger, garlic, and scallions and continue to stir-fry until the chicken is cooked through and white. Feel free to drizzle some more peanut oil to add some moisture. 5. Give the sauce a stir and add it to the skillet, continuing to stir and toss. As soon as the sauce has become thick and shiny, add the peanuts, if using and stir them in. Related post/s: Smoked tofu and celery salad recipe to match Sweat your aSs off at Spicy & Tasty

568 Amsterdam Avenue between 87th and 88th Streets 212/799.7400 about $70 for two, with two beers, with tip ♥ I've never been big on moderation and that's why a lot of the time, I find myself eating and drinking too much and paying way more than I can afford. At The Mermaid Inn, the Dr. pushed on the brakes and ordered for both of us while I went to the restroom. He ordered just enough food to keep me happy and full. The half a dozen oysters were from Washington: briny and just delicious. He's a bigger fan of littleneck clams than I am so I let him finish five out of the other half dozen. If I called the shots, I would have ordered a whole roasted fish after the oysters and the littleneck clams that we started with. Instead, we split a bowl of steamed mussels. It hit the spot and our waiter accommodated our request for some extra toasted bread to sop up the leftover aromatic broth. Sometimes, you just want a no-frills dinner in the city. At the new branch of the Mermaid Inn, we got just that.

1900 Broadway between 63rd and 64th Streets 212/595.3034 about $60 each for two, with drinks, with tip ♥ The first time we tried to eat at Bar Boulud, we chose to sit outside with the theater crowd. We were looking at the menu when the heavy wind hit, taking fragile wine glasses with it, shaking the awning violently and scaring the diners enough to make them run inside and to the basement. When it was time for a second visit, I sat at the bar where one of the servers excused himself more than once to use the ham slicer. He heeded my joke about giving me a plate of the jambon for the inconvenience. The Thomas Schlesser-designed space is stunning. The long vaulted ceiling reminds you of an old wine cellar as soon as you walk in. Even if the restaurant is full-and even if your purse gets bumped into by the runners multiple times-you still get a feeling of some intimacy and warmth. I can't resist a duck leg confit whenever I'm eating bistro food, so two of us split that after a serving of pea soup with mint creme fraîche and escargots with potato croquettes. The summer beans were a little too chewy for my taste and I wanted the duck meat to give more easily than it did. I can recall better duck confit at Balthazar. One of the dessert specials involved blackberries and blueberries so it seemed like the best choice for a summery and tart end to our night. I'm no expert on sweets but I had no clue why whatever came out was chewy and candied. It looked unappetizing. We picked the berries and left the pie barely touched. I still remember my experience at Daniel six years ago. It was my first foray into fine dining. The food was something I've only read in books and seen in photographs. The bill was the first time my heart skipped a beat inside a restaurant. Though I knew that Bar Boulud would be more casual, I still had high expectations of the food. It wasn't quite what I expected Chef Boulud would put out and approve of. Related post/s: I was young then, at Daniel You'd feel better at Dovetail if you're in the upper west side

As soon as I set eyes on that tart I thought 'baked beans' - I then looked eagerly for the part in the text where you tell me what it actually is, but there is no part! In this case, i must conclude that is a tart - made from baked beans and therefore probably one of the worst food creations I have ever seen. That is such a bizarre concept - I wonder if it really is.

403 First Avenue corner of 12th Street 646/602.1300 about $80 each for four, with drinks, with tip ♥ ♥ I don't think I've met a more sincere maitre d' than the petite woman at Hearth. We didn't have reservations when four of us stopped by. We were hoping to get seated at the kitchen pass, a first come-first served area where food is served omakase style. They had just seated another group a few minutes before we walked in but the maitre d' let us have a table in the back. The restaurant was buzzing at 8pm so service was a little too slow. It took about 15 minutes to get the chance to order our cocktails and another 15 to actually receive them. We waited another 20 to order our food. I finally waved to the bread guy to get the sommelier's attention. We didn't mind, though, because we were able to catch up with our friend from out of town. (The wine list comes with a lot of copy that can keep you entertained while waiting.) We started with the New Zealand red snapper crudo with lemon, red pepper and some rosemary. They easily popped in our mouths and they were gone in less than 10 minutes. The fava beans and Pecorino salad was more substantial; the pepperoncini adding just a touch of brightness to the dish's summer flavor. Our Dame Judi Dench vodkas cooled us down while we waited for our main dishes. Our friend liked the tagliatelle with Laughing Bird shrimp, arugula and basil. But the other wasn't a big fan of the pork belly (!) that came with the Berkshire pork loin, so I ended up picking from his plate. After all, there is nothing more sad than pork belly going to waste. The Dr. and I split the braised veal breast with sweetbreads, peas, carrots and Hen of the Woods mushrooms. We paired the dish with a side of very firm but tender gnocchi. It was hearty and earthy at the same time, and with the bottle of delicious Sao, we fast-forwarded to autumn. Hearth reminds me of the early years of The Tasting Room when everything tasted simple. If I wasn't still mourning the loss of the Alevras' restaurant, I'd probably make room for Chef Marco Canora and Jordan Frosolone. But like any other Cia favorites, that comes with more than one visit.

Serita came back from Bali a couple of weeks ago and brought home fresh-and very fragrant-vanilla beans. I was able to get my hands on a few of them. I wouldn't have thought about corn soup with vanilla if I didn't have them, but once I did, I only imagined a soup that was velvety and smooth. I followed an existing vegetable soup recipe as my guide, but I added heavy cream to complement the milk that came from pureeing the corn kernels. To give it some extra body, I added mashed boiled potatoes. The corn was naturally sweet, so adding pancetta just rounded off the taste. It was the perfect balance of salty and sweet; a great appetizer for another Supper with Strangers. Ingredients: 5 fresh corns on the cob, husk and silk peeled off 1 vanilla bean, scraped 2 potatoes, peeled, boiled, mashed half a pint of heavy cream 1 tbsp sugar a chunk of pancetta, chopped, fried until toasted fresh nutmeg salt 1. Steam corn for about 10 minutes. When cool enough to handle, slice off kernels into a sauce pot. Cook kernels with vanilla and mashed potatoes in low heat until combined. Mix in salt and sugar and stir well. 2. Transfer to a food processor and puree. Add a little heavy cream in batches until desired smooth consistency is reached. Feel free to add a little water if it's too thick. 3. To serve, spoon corn soup in a bowl, sprinkle pancetta and grated nutmeg on top.

I made this once as written and enjoyed it, and then made it a second time and enjoyed it even more with these modifications: I used steamed cauliflower (2 heads) rather than potatoes as the binder, and I roasted the corn instead of steaming it (30min directly on the oven rack at 350 degrees, husk and all). The cauliflower was so much smoother than the potato that I only ended up using about half the cream. Give it a try!

Because I bought the roast pork to assemble these tamales, I'll let you call me lazy. For our second Supper with Strangers, our featured ingredient was corn and we served mini roast pork tamales as amuse-bouches. How lucky was I to discover homemade pork stock from the Dr.'s fridge made from the leftover pig's trotters I bought last week? (Thanks for letting me gloat.) Sure you can also use store-bought stock, but it made a difference here. Of course, if you roast your own pork, then you can save the stock when you boil the pork before roasting. Even though the pork was store-bought, these tamales still required some work. I soaked the dried corn husks for about an hour before I sat down to assemble them, and when the husks weren't quite pliable, I soaked them overnight. You can get masa harina from the Spanish or Mexican aisle of your grocery store or ask for the flour they use to make tortillas. It should be where the corn husks are if your store is organized. Use a whole corn husk if you want to make your tamales bigger and obviously use a larger ball of masa and pork. If they're bigger, then you can get away with just putting a heavy bowl over them to keep them closed until you're ready to steam. If making extras for later, store in a resealable freezer bag and steam frozen for an extra 5 minutes. Ingredients: 6 dried corn husks, rinsed clean, soaked in water overnight, dried with paper towel, halved 2 cups roast pork, shredded with a fork 2 cups masa harina pork stock half a stick of butter, melted in the microwave chili powder salt 1. Get your masa ready. In a large bowl, combine masa harina with the butter, chili powder, salt and some of the pork stock. Mix with your hands and pour in a little bit of the stock at a time until the consistency is spreadable. 2. Assemble the tamales. Starting with a spoonful of masa, mix in a bit of the shredded roast pork and make a small ball with your hands. Spread masa with pork on half a corn husk with your fingers. Fold sides until they just overlap and then fold the top and bottom flaps over. You can tear a thin strip of corn husk to use as a ribbon to tie each tamales close. 3. When ready to cook, boil some water in a large skillet. Steam tamales in a metal colander placed inside the skillet for 15 minutes, covered.

803 Washington Avenue between Eastern Parkway and Lincoln Place, Brooklyn 718/398.3575 about $40 for three dishes, without drinks, with tip ♥ No roti today? I wanted to make sure I heard correctly. I was so excited to eat at Islands after hearing favorable reviews on places to eat around the Brooklyn Museum, but eating goat curry without fresh, warm roti to wrap the meat and sop up the yellow sauce with just about killed the experience. We craned our necks to climb the steep and very narrow stairs to sit where the air conditioning was working properly. With our goat curry, we ordered the Jamaican staple of jerk chicken and the oxtail stew. Whatever disappointment I harbored because I was unable to show off how roti tastes to my friend, who came all the way from New Jersey to hang out with me, disappeared as soon as I had a taste of the oxtail. The meat separated from the large bone right away, with only a slight pull using my fork. I scooped up some of the red orange sauce onto my rice and ate heartily. The chicken was not as jerky as I would like it to be, but we devoured the meat down to the bone. The goat was salty, without the roti and all, so it was barely touched. I would have taken it home if we didn't plan on being out all day because there's something about leftover curry that I like. Walk down Washington Avenue and you'll see a few more places to while away your time after a visit to the museum or the botanical garden, including Franklin Park beer garden off St. John's Place, but do yourself a favor and eat island food that will keep you going all day.

Burgers are burgers, right? It's summer and you've gone to your fifth barbecue this season and yet, you really haven't had a decent burger. There must be something you can do to make it more than just a burger. Over the weekend, the Dr. and I invited several people to upstate New York where we rented a house. We drove the night before bringing with us a cooler full of meats I ordered from my CSA share, or Community-Supported Agriculture. I ordered them ahead of time from Lewis Waite Farm in Greenwich thinking of the lamb chops, pig's trotters and beef burgers we could grill for us and our friends. Cameron volunteered to make patties out of the grass-fed ground beef with smoked Gouda cheese and the prerequisites: garlic, onions, parsley. Two days later, I couldn't help but recreate them at home. I used my grill pan and turned the vent on high to absorb the smoke and the smell. Instead of smoked Gouda, I used the blue cheese I've kept fresh in the fridge using Press'n Seal. The flavor is more fierce than the ones Cameron made because of the cheese, but man, did I have an excellent dinner for a Monday night. Ingredients: 1 pound ground beef a small chunk of blue cheese, crumbled 1 medium red onion, finely chopped half a bunch of parsley, finely chopped 3 cloves of garlic, minced 1 red chile, seeded, finely chopped oil, salt, pepper 1. Combine all ingredients, except the oil, in a bowl with a dash of salt and pepper. Form extra large golf-sized balls with your hands to help them stick together and then gently flatten them out with your palms to form patties. 2. Heat some oil on a grill pan over medium-high heat. When almost smoking, add the patties to fry. I was able to fit 3 of the 5 patties I made. Using an iron grill press, put on top of the patties to weigh them down. Remove press and flip the burgers slowly using a heat-resistant spatula. Replace the press to cook the other side of the patties. Each side can be cooked medium-rare in about 3 minutes. Remove to a plate and finish cooking all the other patties. 3. Serve sandwiches in toasted buns with some hot pickles and mustard.

Walk around downtown Vancouver and you'll come across several hotdog stands flocked by a diverse group of people. I come from a city where there is a hotdog stand on every other block and where a Japanese guy stuffs his face with Nathan's every Fourth of July, so I'm not new to the Japanese-hotdog combination, but the hotdog from Japa Dog is definitely one of the most satisfying snacks I've had in a very long time. We've been walking all day and the last thing the Dr. wanted to hear was my request to keep walking towards the other direction to buy a hotdog. I tried to explain that the hotdogs have a Japanese flair to them, but there are plenty of days when a Korean boy just won't listen. I spotted the line of Japanese girls across the street before I realized we were finally on Haro Street. We crossed and joined the queue for the first hotdog drawing that caught my eye. The Oroshi is a bratwurst sprinkled with grated daikon and finely chopped scallions with a \"special\" soy sauce. I was halfway into finishing it when the Dr. finally asked for a taste. I tried to deter him from sharing it with me by telling him, Eh, it's just a hotdog, but my eagerness to finish it didn't help. The last bite made an impression on him and he encouraged me to join the queue again to buy another one. This time, I chose the Terimayo: hotdog with mayo and fried onions in teriyaki sauce and nori. If dinner wasn't in the next hour, I could have eaten another. And perhaps another. I pretty much rested my case with the second dog. I might make you walk miles for your food, but most of the time, the work is worth it. Japa Dog is on Burrard Street on the corner of Haro in downtown Vancouver, Canada. For five Canadian dollars, you can join the others who have come before you: Ice Cube, Anthony Bourdain, and oh, \"that Asian guy from Lost\".

We were escorted by the maitre d' to the sushi bar as soon as we walked in for our 7pm reservations at Tojo's in Vancouver, Canada. While I was trying to hoist myself up on the tall bar seat, I immediately recognized Chef Tojo because Anthony Bourdain sat and ate at the same sushi bar for one of his No Reservations episodes. The chef fucker that I am, I was thrilled that Chef Tojo will be the one preparing our food for the night. We didn't have any concrete plans for our weekend stay in Vancouver, but I made sure that we had a spot at Tojo's bar for our last night in Canada. When Chef inquired where we came from and we said New York, he asked us if we knew \"Mistah Boh-dain.\" That man drinks and smokes too much, he said, while pretending to chug and smoke with his hands. When Chef Tojo smiles, his eyes get smaller, and you can't help but love the cheery old Japanese man in him. I promise you that everything you taste here, you've never had before. It was a big challenge and we were up for it-armed with an empty stomach and a credit card to swallow the equal exchange rate between the American and Canadian dollars. We started off with the albacore tuna with pureed Japanese yam and micro greens. I've had the yam before at Sobaya off St. Marks back in the city and really love that consistency which reminds me of the okra goo. It was an excellent start: the tuna was tender yet buttery. There was a subtle trace of ponzu sauce that was just enough to make you want more. Just the day before, we were at the Granville Island public market where we salivated over morels that were priced significantly less than in New York. (I suppose everything is.) I would have smuggled them across the border if I had the balls to, but I don't, so the morels stuffed with scallops on a bed of dandelion greens and sprouts just had to do. Crunchy and toasty, I felt sad that I can't afford to buy morels in the United States to try and replicate this dish at home. The next dish put a smile on my face: octopus salad with one of the tentacles' suction cups and a small edible flower to perhaps sweeten the initial reaction that most people have upon seeing an alien-looking part in their food. Right under the slivers of octopus were julienned daikon and cucumber. I've never had octopus sliced this way before; its thinness gave it a slithery texture and I had to slurp each piece down before it had a chance to escape my mouth. The next dish was a nice surprise because we definitely never had it before. You know when you eat at a restaurant and you're offered one dish that makes you think, \"This is it!\"? That's how I felt about this one. It had Chef Tojo's signature all over it. Wrapped in paper, our bowl had a sablefish inside cooked in a broth I can't even begin to explain. When we unwrapped our bowls, a faint smoke escaped and you just had to close your eyes to catch a whiff of the sophisticated smell. It was one of those dishes that looked simple, and yet tasted so elegantly that you know a lot of thought was put into it. Deconstructed, the smokiness of the fish remained and even through the skin, the broth tasted pure and clean. The burdock root and asparagus held the dish together with their crunchiness. I could have ended here and shaken Chef's hands, but alas five more awaited us. The geoduck was referred to as the giant clam. I suppose only a few of us would like to eat anything pronounced \"gooey\". It was a typical Japanese roll with mayo and I hardly tasted the clam because of it. It seemed that our dishes got more simpler as we progressed. The tamago, or egg, roll with herring roe was nothing new. Probably my least favorite was the crab meat with avocado and pineapple roll. I just thought I've graduated from rolls with fruit. The inside-out broiled salmon skin roll was very delicious, but how about more of the stuff I haven't tasted before? But we finally reached our limit, so I just asked for something with uni to end our meal. Ask and you shall receive at Tojo's-I received a roll with uni inside. Nothing less, nothing more. For dessert, we picked the pineapple ginger sorbet with a black sesame seed cracker. I like pineapple as much as the next guy, but I don't know what it is about me that can't deal with too much sweetness in her life. You are what you eat? All in all, Tojo's has its good dishes but very few that elicited a reaction like the sablefish did. It's like we got the promised VIP performance, but halfway through, we got the same show that everyone else did. Would I go back? Absolutely. Tojo's is still one of the best places to get sushi in Vancouver, Canada. Tojo's is on 1133 West Broadway, Vancouver BC V6H 1G1. Call 604/872.8050 and reserve a spot at the sushi bar. Be prepared to spend New York City prices, only converted to a stronger Canadian dollar. Related post/s: Tojo's photos and Vancouver, Canada photos on Flickr

This season's prettiest produce is definitely the garlic scape. I've received eight stalks so far from my farm share this season. If it weren't for the garlicky smell, I don't think its identity would have been obvious to me. Garlic scapes are the flower stalks that shoot up from the garlic bulb. They curl up when they're long, but they're usually cut off for the garlic bulbs to grow bigger. I've used them like minced garlic cloves and I've also sliced them thinly to add to breakfast omelets. Pesto, though, is the way to go if you want to use them before they dry up. After a couple of servings of this garlic scape pesto on toasted bread and on gnnochi, I returned the rest of it to the food processor and added fresh basil leaves to tone down the garlicky flavor. Ingredients: 8 garlic scapes, chopped a handful of pine nuts 1 cup Parmiggiano Reggiano, crumbled lemon juice olive oil salt, pepper 1. Pulse garlic scapes, pine nuts and cheese in the food processor until pureed. Slowly drizzle a little bit of olive oil while pulsing. Add lemon juice, salt and pepper to taste. Store in an air-tight jar in the refrigerator for up to two weeks. Related post/s: Add basil leaves to this recipe and make a more subtle pesto Mmm, and then press your own Gruyere sandwiches

On the flight back from Vancouver, I watched one of Jamie Oliver's farm episodes. The guy is living the life: hanging out in the English countryside, gardening, taking care of his own chickens and cooking simple and healthy meals in his adorable kitchen. He made a few dishes during this one episode, but this bresaola omelet salad struck me as something refreshing, but at the same time substantial for a sunny weekend. The key is to cook the egg like a crepe and rolling it to slice it like strands of pasta. Thinly-sliced bresaola, or air-dried beef (think prosciutto, but from a cow), gave this dish the saltiness it needed while the fennel added some crunch and kick to the mixed greens. I woke up famished on Sunday morning after a much-needed sleep. While drinking my iced coffee, I quickly assembled this before heading out to enjoy the rest of my long weekend. Note: Whole Foods doesn't slice bresaola, or any other cured meats, paper-thin. I bet they can't trust those young goons behind the counter with sharp objects. If you're in New York City, Di Palo is the way to go. Ingredients: 4 eggs 8 bresaola, sliced thinly like prosciutto a handful of mixed greens half a bulb of fennel, thinly sliced a squirt of lemon juice oil, salt, pepper 1. In a mixing bowl, beat the eggs with some salt and pepper. Heat a nonstick skillet with some oil. Pour half of the egg mixture and cook over medium-low heat. Make sure the bottom of the pan is covered with the egg by lifting and swaying the pan and letting the egg mixture spread thinly. 2. Once the egg is set, lift one edge of the egg crepe using a spatula and gently roll it to meet the other edge. Remove to a plate. 3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 for the rest of the egg mixture. 4. When cool enough to handle, slice the rolled up egg crepes to make strands. In a large salad bowl, toss the rest of the ingredients together. Top with strands of egg crepe and season with salt and pepper. Related post/s: I like egg with my vegetables Sal from Di Palo will sell you a quarter pound of paper-thin bresaola for less than $5

Here's one thing I rarely cook or eat: salmon. Now, salmon is a perfectly good fish but I think I've been traumatized with the way they prepare it at weddings. Salmon is like shrimp: a few minutes too much and it's overcooked, dry and devoid of taste. But I haven't given up on it. I know that just like any other fish, it will taste good if cooked properly. Besides, after devouring a lot of smoked salmon while I was in Vancouver, I knew I had to play with it some more in the kitchen. It's July 4th and corn should be on everyone's grills this weekend, but they're more expensive this year because of flooding in the Midwest and drought in the South. According to the Des Moines Register, the corn will come eventually, but maybe not for a few weeks. For now, we all have to eat corn from Georgia and Florida. This recipe requires a tamarind concentrate you can buy from your Asian market. If you have access to fresh and ripe tamarinds, all you have to do is soak them in hot water to soften them. Put the pulp through a sieve to extract the juice, discarding skins, seeds and fibers. Ingredients: 4 salmon fillets, patted dry with a paper towel 4 ears of fresh corn, skin and silk peeled off a handful of cilantro, finely chopped half a red bell pepper, finely chopped 1 small red onion, finely chopped 1/2 cup of tamarind concentrate 2 tbsps brown sugar 2 tbsps soy sauce 2 tbsps fish sauce a splash of sherry vinegar 1 red chile, seeded, chopped juice of half a lime oil, salt, pepper 1. Make the tamarind glaze. In a small bowl, mix the tamarind concentrate (or extracted juice if using real tamarinds) with the brown sugar, soy sauce, fish sauce, chile, and lime juice, stirring until sugar is dissolved. 2. Rub the flesh side of the salmon with salt and pepper the brush the glaze over them. Store in the fridge until ready to cook. 3. In the meantime, assemble the corn salad. Using a sharp knife, cut off the corn kernels from the cob and into a salad bowl. Toss with the cilantro, red bell pepper, red onion, lime juice and sherry vinegar. Feel free to adjust the liquids according to your taste. 4. Cook the fish. Heat a nonstick skillet with some oil over medium-high fire. When oil is smoking just a tad bit, gently place the salmon skin side down. Let them cook for 5 minutes without moving them to get a crispy skin. Using a heat-resistant spatula, turn the salmon over and cook the flesh side with tamarind glaze for an extra 3 minutes. Brush the skin side with leftover glaze. Carefully remove to a plate and serve with some of the corn salad.

Watermelon rind pickles are apparently a Southern thing. But I first had them at Fatty Crab, a Zak Pelaccio restaurant here in New York City devoted to Southeast Asian cuisine. I've been wanting to recreate their dish served with crispy pork belly at home, and the opportunity finally came when Cameron and I started planning our first Supper with Strangers. Supper with Strangers is an urban supper club devoted to bringing together New York City's food-loving populace. We think it's a chance to celebrate the season's flavors, meet others with equally good taste, and have them enjoy a fantastic, home-cooked meal with great people. We both love to cook and entertain, so we figured, why not create our very own supper club and meet new people in the process? While we planned the first menu in a span of almost three weeks—that's why the updates on this blog have been intermittent—we wanted to feature cool and refreshing dishes using summer ingredients. One watermelon appetizer idea brought us to featuring watermelon as the main ingredient for all our dishes, a la Iron Chef. After several tastings, we came up with a winning menu and consulted with Pour Wines for wine and beer pairings. Welcome cocktail: Watermelon-Shiso Mojito Amuse-bouche: Kebab of Watermelon, Bresaola, and Caper Berry Vegetarian alternate: sheep's milk cheese instead of bresaola Appetizer: Chilled Thai-Spiced Watermelon Soup with Crab Vegetarian alternate: sans the crab Paired with: Francois Pinon Vouvray Tendre Cuvee Tradition, 2006, Loire Valley Main dish: Fried Pork Belly with Pickled Watermelon Rinds Vegetarian alternate: Roasted Golden Beet with Shiitake Mushrooms and Pickled Watermelon Rinds Paired with: Ommegang Hennepin Farmhouse Saison Ale, Cooperstown, NY Salad: Watermelon and Green Papaya Salad with Tequila Vinaigrette Paired with: Salneval Albariño, 2007, Galicia, Spain Dessert: Watermelon Cream Sorbet with Pirouettes Served with coffee or mint tea Ingredients: watermelon rind, 4 quarts of 1-inch chunks (see directions for preparation) 2 cups white vinegar 4 cups white sugar 1 tbsp whole cloves 5 cinnamon sticks 2 star anise 1 tbsp juniper berries a pinch of mustard seeds 2 cups of water 1. Slice open the watermelon your usual way. Separate the red flesh from the rind. (Eat the red flesh later!) Peel the green skin off the rinds. Chop rinds in smaller chunks. 2. Make the brine. In a large pot, combine all the ingredients except rind and cook over medium fire until sugar dissolves. Remove pot from heat and let completely cool. 3. Transfer watermelon rind chunks in a pickling jar. Pour in brine until all of the rinds are submerged. I put a small and heavy tea cup to weigh the rinds down inside the pickling jar. Store in the refrigerator for at least 2 weeks. Related post/s: Join us at Supper with Strangers once a month Inaugural Supper with Strangers photos on Flickr Crispy pork belly recipe

Remember the rhubarb sauce I made a couple of weeks ago? I've stir-fried it with fish and braised pork belly with it and I still have half a tub leftover. I searched through my recipe archives and thought, well, I can make panna cotta with it, yeah? It's a simple sauce with a subtle flavor so it should work. It did and it made for a nice summer dessert completed with delicately sliced sweet strawberries. Ingredients: 1/2 cup whole milk 1 1/2 tsps unflavored powdered gelatin 1 1/2 cups heavy cream 1/4 cup of rhubarb sauce 1/4 cup sugar a pinch salt strawberries for garnish, sliced 1. Place the milk in a heavy, small saucepan. Sprinkle the gelatin over and let stand for 5 minutes to soften the gelatin. Stir over medium heat just until the gelatin dissolves, but the milk does not boil, about 2 minutes. 2. Add the cream, rhubarb sauce, sugar, and salt. Stir over low heat, until the sugar dissolves, about 3 more minutes. Remove from the heat and let cool slightly. 3. Pour the cream mixture into 2 martini glasses, dividing equally. Cover with Saran wrap and refrigerate. Chill until set, at least 6 hours and up to 2 days. 4. When ready to serve, top with strawberries.

Fish Braised in Sundried Tomatoes

Anna sent me a pack of sundried tomatoes from her recent trip to Argentina so I went searching for recipes using them as the main ingredient. There were a lot of proven recipes for spreads and pastes, so I stuck with one of them and just used it on fish I bought for my weekly omakase bento at work. The heavy cream was rather random but I needed to dilute the tomatoes' saltiness without losing the consistency of the braising sauce. It was also the only thing I had handy in the fridge. Toss with some basil chiffonade and serve with an unsalted orzo and you should be all set. Any white fish will do here. Cod will be excellent, but a lower-priced Swai is good, too. And you know what? I spread the sundried tomato paste on a portobello mushroom and grilled that for the vegetarian in the group, and he liked it, too. Ingredients: 4 fish fillets a splash of heavy cream a handful of sundried tomatoes, soaked in hot water for at least 15 minutes, patted dry with a paper towel a handful of basil leaves 3 cloves of garlic a splash of sherry vinegar oil, salt, pepper 1. Make sundried tomato paste. Using a food processor, pulse tomatoes, garlic and basil, adding some oil until you reach the consistency of paste. Season with pepper. Transfer to a container. 2. Lightly salt the fish. (The tomatoes will add more saltiness.) Sprinkle some pepper, too. Using a spatula, spread some of the paste onto the fish. 3. Heat some oil in a large skillet. Add the tomato-covered fish and cook for about 3 minutes per side, uncovered. Lower the heat and add the heavy cream. Gently scrape off the bits and pieces under the fish, cover and steam for an extra 5 minutes. Uncover and transfer the fish to a plate.

65 East 55th Street between Park and Madison Avenues 212/593.0287 about $90 each for six, with several drinks, with tacked on 20% tip ♥ ♥ I dragged five others to the Aquavit Cafe earlier this week to take advantage of Herring Week, the annual celebration for all things herring. I had such a fun time eating with new people who were down to eat herring prepared in different ways. This was my first time back at the restaurant after they moved a couple of years ago. The cafe is bigger and looks more like a hotel lobby restaurant. I didn't get past the bar and to the main dining room, but I would bet that the waterfall is now gone. Chef Marcus Samuelsson now has a sushi restaurant and his name is mentioned in more food events around the city, but the Scandinavian spirit that he introduced to diners like me is still well and alive. The herring buffet was situated along the entrance to the cafe. The two times we made the trip to serve ourselves, we had to watch out for the waiters and the busboys. But oh, we wanted herring and did we get some! There was the usual pickled herring, vinegar-y and lip-smackin' good. There was smoked herring, flaky and perfect with a Whale's Tale Ale. There were interesting and delicious combinations like herring with onions and carrots, herring in a light green sauce that we thought was made out of dill and herring with caviar. Then there were the odd ones that surprisingly worked: herring egg salad and herring pate. And ones that didn't: herring with sweet tomato sauce and herring with curry. The buffet wasn't all herring, which was quite a relief after we've filled our empty stomachs with the almighty fish. I had smoked salmon topped with pickled cucumbers, roasted potatoes slathered with gravy, Swedish meatballs with lingonberry sauce and anchovy pizette with a cherry tomato. I skipped the bread and the greens to make more room for a second trip to the buffet. We forced ourselves to eat the included desserts, not because we wanted anything sweet but because we wanted something to cleanse our palates. The Arctic Circle was a goat cheese cylinder filled with passion fruit, topped with a tarty and refreshing sorbet of black currants. (I love me some tarty desserts!) Two in the group opted for the chocolate with several other ingredients I barely recall now. It was a good time until we got our bill. Even though we chose to do the buffet, a 20% gratuity was automatically included because we were a group of six. We ended up paying almost $100 each including our drinks. Even though the bill was up to par with my usual night out with friends, I thought this was quite pricey considering we had to get up and serve ourselves. I love herring, but maybe I'll stick with the Formica tables in Grand Central Oyster Bar during Herring Week next year.

When Jen first showed me the link to OctoDog, I squealed. I didn't care if the toy was $16.95 apiece; I wanted one. A few weeks later, I squealed again when a box came in the mail and my red OctoDog was in it. I immediately wanted to try it, but to be honest, I don't eat too many hot dogs at home. Off I went to the neighborhood grocery store where I spent several minutes in front of the frankfurter aisle trying to decipher which was long and big enough to fit in my OctoDog. From a quick glance, the OctoDog seems to be pretty thick. I knew that it wasn't going to work for the skinny Sabrett hot dogs. I had to pick from what New York street vendors call sausages. Back at home, I followed the easy instructions that came with the OctoDog. I took the OctoDog apart including the \"eyes\". I then inserted the hot dog inside the \"tentacles\" and replaced the eyes which essentially held the hot dog in place. I pushed the hot dog in using the OctoDog base-this cuts the lower half of the hot dog into \"tentacles\". I then pulled the base out and removed the \"eyes\" that held the hot dog in place. A little shake and the hot dog fell off the tentacle hold and voila! A hot dog with eight \"arms\"! Why don't you just go to their Web site and see the illustrated How-To? It sounds more appetizing without bothering with too many words. I was thrilled to have made my own OctoDogs. I heated a small skillet with some oil, gently fried the hot dogs by rolling them in the hot oil. I served them with a couple of fried eggs and some fried rice for a Sunday breakfast, Filipino hotsilog (hot dog-siningag-itlog), or hot dog-fried rice-fried egg, style. I don't know any kid out there who needs convincing to eat a hot dog and I don't know why any one would refuse to eat a dressed up hot dog with \"legs\". At almost $20 including shipping and handling, it's an unnecessary toy that's fun to have in your kitchen for your child and your child at heart. Related post/s: Buy your own OctoDog!

The two Rs of spring-ramps and rhubarb-came and went but I was fast enough to get my yield in this year. With the ramps, I pickled and sauteed; with the rhubarb, I made dessert and this sauce. I was craving fish after an hour-long workout in the pool and I ended up taking home a whole branzino with me. (From Whole Foods, not the pool.) In the end, it was the wrong fish to match with this sauce because branzino is so rich that it doesn't really need any help to taste good. The next day, I served this rhubarb sauce with fried and breaded tilapia fillet and together, they made the perfect match. A little tangy and a little sweet, it gave life to an otherwise plain white fish. Update: Cameron alerted me to a Jamie Oliver recipe using pork belly with rhubarb sauce. So I browned some cubed pork belly and braised them in rhubarb sauce for about 1 hour at 350º. Ingredients: 6 pieces of rhubarb, chopped in half-inch pieces a small knob of ginger, peeled, minced, chopped 1 small red onion, finely chopped 1/3 cup apple cider vinegar 1/2 cup sugar 1 cinnamon stick a pinch of whole cloves 1 star anise salt, pepper 1. Place rhubarb, 1/4 cup water and ginger in a small saucepan. Simmer for 5 minutes and set aside. 2. In another pan, combine sugar and cider vinegar with 2 cups water and bring to a rolling boil. Add the onion. Cook for 2 minutes. Drain to discard the onions. Remove cinnamon, cloves and anise. Add this mixture to the rhubarb. Season with salt and pepper.

The pork chops from DeBragga.com glistened in the morning light coming through the kitchen. I couldn't get over how beautiful the marbling was. Pork chops are easy to find but they're never beautifully cut like these, almost like lamb. I've cooked a lot of tried and true pork chop recipes for this Web site but I wanted to try something new for this batch. I used Mark Bittman's ribs recipe using stout beer. That looked so good and I wanted to try it for pork. A little bit of browning and braising were all it took for the meat to fall apart from the bones. I even had to skip the roasting part and just served them straight from the Dutch oven. Golden brown on the outside but soft inside, they were the perfect pick me ups for a lazy weekend lunch. Ingredients: 4 pork chops, seasoned with salt and pepper 1 bottle or can of Guinness, or any stout beer 3 cinnamon sticks 1 tsp of allspice 2 red chiles, crushed 1 small knob of ginger, peeled, minced 2 cloves of garlic, minced oil, salt, pepper 1. Preheat oven to 350º. In the meantime, brown pork chops in a large Dutch oven with hot oil over medium heat, about 8 minutes per side. Remove chops and set aside. Discard oil except for 2 tbsps. 2. Return the pot over medium heat. Saute garlic and ginger. Toast cinnamon sticks, chiles and allspice. Add the chops back in and pour in beer. Using a wooden spoon, scrape off the bits and pieces from the bottom of the pan. 3. When oven is ready, cover the pot and braise in the oven for 1 hour, turning the chops after 45 minutes. Serve chops on a plate with some of the beer sauce. Related post/s: Get your own beautiful pork chops from DeBragga.com Match pork chops with cherries in the summer Or whiskey in the winter

Searching for a Good Taco: El Barrio, East Harlem

***CONTENT
East Harlem, the neighborhood bordered by 96th and 125th Streets between Fifth Avenue and the east river, is referred to as El Barrio because it has been a predominantly Puerto Rican enclave. It literally means \"the neighborhood\". Some people would even say it goes all the way to 142nd because Dominicans and other Caribbean groups have assembled in that part of Manhattan. Mexicans have also moved in to take advantage of the still-affordable rents above 116th Street. But with the on and off plans of a giant Home Depot and a Wal-Mart on the east side to match the condos going up, young families driven by rising rents downtown have also called El Barrio home. Today, an Old Navy, H&M and a Starbucks on 125th Street co-exist with the historic Apollo Theater while juice counters, fabric stores and chicharron shops are struggling to keep their businesses open. The future of El Barrio is iffy and we all just have to wait and see what the rezoning of Harlem brings. Searching for a good taco in this side of Harlem-I live on the west side-was easier and less contentious than recent events in the news. I knew it as soon as I walked in Taco Mix, tip-toed and caught a glimpse of the big vat of pork simmering next to the grill. I thought I was going to need some of my friends to help me scour the many-and there are many-Mexican holes-in-the-wall in East Harlem, but after comparing several tacos from all four of the stores below, Taco Mix's buche taco took the cake. 1. La Lomita Del Barrio, 209 East 116th Street, 212/289.8138 I stopped by La Lomita because they had beautiful fruits and vegetables for sale outside their store. I saw my first watermelon of the season, decided against buying and carrying such a heavy load, and instead sat at the tiled counter to eat chorizo and carnitas tacos. The chorizo was crushed and crumbled before the lady put it on the grill. I loved the sharpness of the chiles and the aroma of the cloves, but I would have rather eaten it as a sausage without the tortilla. The carnitas was just all right because some of the bigger chunks were a little dry. A lot of cilantro and onions helped me finish them off. 2. Michelle Deli & Grocery, 215 East 116th Street, 212/828.9097 Just next door was another deli with a tiled counter selling tacos. The tripe was not on the menu but I watched an older man devour a bowl of it while I waited for my order of beef tacos: cecina which is more jerky and therefore chewy, and suadero, or beef stew, which was a little on the dry side and needed some fat content. I sure wish I got the tripe stew instead of their tacos. 3. Cart run by two ladies off the corner of 116th and Second Avenue I stopped by the cart covered in blue tarp off Second Avenue to ask the ladies what they were selling because the tortillas they were pressing looked like arepas. They were for tacos, they insisted, so I bought a chicken and a beef one. They didn't hear my usual request of skipping the mayo-like white sauce, so I was forced to eat them like messy gyros. They were bigger and needed to be packed and taken at home to enjoy. Back at home, I realized that the tortillas were thicker and more dense. Though I like that combination for my cakes, it wasn't the best tortilla for tacos. 4. Taco Mix, 234 East 116th Street, 212/831.8147 I've gone back to Taco Mix several times after my initial visit for this write-up. When I go, I always order the buche, or the pork belly, and the oreja, or the ears, for some texture. I've since tasted their carnitas, chorizo, al pastor and suadero tacos and must say that all their tacos are far more superior than those of the surrounding delis and stores. When the lone table in the back is unoccupied, you can sit, eat in and watch the Mexican soap opera blaring from the TV screens. Young men walk in and out, order their dinner and stand over the condiments counter to eat swiftly, while the two guys who work the kitchen chit-chat behind all the meat-smelling smoke. Just another slice of life in Harlem some of us call home.

And of course, there are plenty of mexican restaurants on 8th and 9th avenue. West of that is probably where you'd find more bodegas with tacos in the back.

It felt like Christmas morning when I received a Styrofoam box in the mail that was filled with two racks of lamb, four pork chops, four rib steaks and a container of fleur de sel. The Rack Pack grill kit from DeBragga.com was the only thing I was waiting for before I could begin my long weekend. When it arrived and I saw how beautiful the choice cuts were inside their vacuum-sealed plastics, I couldn't wait to start cooking and grilling them for myself and my friends. You know when they say you pay a price for something premium? This rack of lamb is it. In Austin, we bought the same size of rack for about $50; it would be a little more than that in New York City. If you think about the grill kit's price, you already know you have a good deal if two racks will cost you at least $100 at your supermarket. But this is not your supermarket's lamb-they had a good amount of fat and we only needed some salt and pepper to make a meal out of each rack. For the beef steaks, we used the oil it rendered after roasting it in the oven and cooked it with some garlic, shallots, thyme and a splash of red wine to make an accompanying sauce. The steaks were delicious with the sauce, but I also found that they were rich and succulent on their own. I know you're not supposed to say never, but after these DeBragga meats, I think I can comfortably say that I will never become a vegetarian. I spent a little more time being creative with the pork chops. Stay tuned for the recipe using Guinness beer!

Seriously, what did people do before Google? When I bought several squid from Chinatown, I wasn't exactly sure if they were squid or cuttlefish. They looked bigger than the squid I'm used to and if you've been to any of the stores in Chinatown, you know it's hard to get a straight answer from any of the clerks. The squid were already cleaned off the plastic-y spine inside and that was my only way to tell one from the other: the cuttlefish \"skeleton\" is wider than that of a squid's. So I Googled and found several indistinguishable photos of squid and cuttlefish-looking things but then finally discovered this short paragraph from EnchantedLearning.com: The body of the cuttlefish (the cuttle) is flattened and has fins that extend along the entire length of the mantle. There you go; mine didn't and that settled the dilemma of naming this recipe. They were also butterflied open which required some butcher's twine to close them up again after being stuffed. If you can get your squid cleaned but intact, you can easily stuff them through the head opening where the tentacles used to be. Ingredients: 5 squid, cleaned, kept whole if possible, tentacles separated and finely chopped 1 small carrot, finely chopped 5 pieces of string beans, chopped 1/2 cup of bread crumbs 1 medium can of crushed tomatoes 2 stalks of parsley, finely chopped 2 stalks of scallions, finely chopped 2 cloves garlic, minced 1 red chile, crushed oil, salt, pepper 1. Preheat an oven to 375º. 2. Heat some oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Saue garlic until brown and then the scallions until translucent. Add the chopped squid tentacles, the carrots and beans and cook for about 5 minutes by frequently tossing. Season with salt and chile. Add the bread crumbs and the parsley and mix to toast. You should now have a somewhat sticky mixture for your stuffing. Remove from heat and set aside. 3. On a large chopping block, lay the butterflied squid open. Spoon some of the tentacle mixture and spread all along the cavity. Grab one end of the squid and roll over the other. Wrap and tie to close with butcher's twine. Gently move stuffed squid to a baking dish. Pour crushed tomato sauce over them. 4. Bake in the oven for about 15 minutes. To serve, carefully slice each squid into 3. The twine should easily come off so you can discard.

I started my Saturday famished. The last of my wisdom teeth was extracted and the only thing I could eat was soup for my last two meals. The Vicodin didn't quite affect me the way I wanted it to so I was left to fend for myself when I woke up. There were only a couple of eggplants in the fridge and one large tomato, but there were plenty of fresh herbs on the counter. When I have to create a quick meal without using too many ingredients, I usually turn to pasta-there's always a box of some kind of pasta in the cupboard. I had some leftover pesto in a jar so I decided to add a dollop of that, too, to add some basil-y taste to the dish. I recreated one of my favorite sandwiches, pressed pesto and Gruyere-Parmesan, to match. Ingredients: 2 cups of penne 2 eggplants, cut lengthwise then halved 1 tomato, quartered then halved 1 sprig of rosemary, roughly chopped 1 sprig of sage, roughly chopped 1 tbsp of pesto 1/4 cup of red wine vinegar 1 dried Thai chile, crushed lemon juice oil, salt, pepper 1. In a large mixing bowl, toss eggplants and tomatoes with vinegar, olive oil, salt and pepper. Transfer vegetables onto a baking sheet, flesh side up. Roast in the oven for about 15 minutes or until tomatoes are soft and a little burnt on the outside. Remove from oven and set aside to cool a little bit. 2. Meanwhile, cook penne al dente. Drain and transfer to a serving bowl. 3. When ready to serve, add the vegetables with the pasta. Toss with rosemary, sage and pesto. Squirt some lemon juice and sprinkle with chile to taste.

Rellenong Bangus, Stuffed Milkfish

Relleno in Spanish food generally means stuffing, usually a meat mixture that's been breaded and then fried. It's applied in Filipino food using the same concept but in this recipe, the meat of my country's national fish, milkfish or bangus, is removed from the cavity, tossed and stir-fried with other ingredients, stuffed back in the fish and then sealed before roasting to a golden brown color. I grew up eating this stuffed fish at family birthday parties. The kids always enjoyed the fried red hot dogs and marshmallows in skewers while the adults ate the \"real\" food like rellenong bangus. Milkfish is extremely bony and one needs a lot of patience to remove the very fine threads of bones but I've always thought the reward was much greater than the work. I gently pounded the fish using the smooth end of a tenderizer mallet to loosen the meat from its skin and then I sliced off the meat from its skin using a very sharp boning knife. A little maneuvering near the tail helped break off the larger bone in the middle. I knew that knife had its purpose! The entire process took 45 minutes-not bad for an amateur. I left the sewing of the fish shut to my mother who is lighter handed with a giant needle and butcher's twine than I am. The result, a cleanly sutured stuffed milkfish. Ingredients: 1 milkfish, thawed if previously frozen, scaled, cleaned, sliced open along the stomach 3 tbsps ground pork 1 small carrot, finely chopped a handful of raisins 1/4 cup bread crumbs 1 stalk scallion, finely chopped 3 stalks of parsley, finely chopped 1 clove of garlic, minced oil, salt, pepper 1. Using the smooth end of a meat tenderizer mallet, gently pound the milkfish on a chopping block. Be careful not to pierce the skin. With a sharp boning knife, begin to separate the meat from the fish's skin. Remove fish bones as you see them. 2. In a large skillet, heat some oil. Saute garlic and scallions until scallions are soft. Add ground pork and fry. Add carrots and parsley and continue to toss until the ground pork is brown. 3. Add the fish meat with the raisins and toss to continue cooking. Mix in the bread crumbs. Season with salt and pepper. Remove to a bowl and let cool to room temperature. 4. Stuff the milkfish by spreading the meat and fish mixture evenly inside the fish cavity. Hold the seams together and sew close using butcher's twine and needle. Brush the outside of the fish with some oil and put on a roasting pan. 5. Roast one side of the fish for about 10 minutes. Carefully turn the fish and roast the other side for another 7. Remove from the oven and let the fish slightly cool before slicing to reveal the stuffing inside.

462 Broadway corner of Grand Street 212/219.3300 about $120 for two, with four drinks, with tip ♥ L'Ecole's five-course dinner is probably the city's lowest-priced prix fixe at $40, but at that unbelievable price, how does the food taste? Well, like $8 apiece. The restaurant prides itself in using sustainable seafood but I missed any information about their meat and vegetable sources. I assume they buy everything from the farmers' market, but I wonder how they afford to charge less than $10 a plate if that was the case. An appetizer of asparagus with crumbled chorizo sounded great but came out tasteless. I understood that the pan tomate with Manchego cheese was included to round up a Spanish-inspired dish, but they were disconnected here and the triangle of a sandwich needed to spend a little more time on the grill press. The scallops were presented well in a row of shells topped with roe. They would have made great amuse bouches as they were actually lighter than the ones we received made of pancake batter. I looked forward to my trout served in a curried mussel broth on a bed of baby bok choy, but the fish was under-seasoned and no amount of curry rescued it from blandness. The fluke was immemorable with braised cabbage and mushrooms. My Cornish hen needed some sauce to make the white meat taste like something. I thought the rhubarb that came with the duck would have been a perfect accompaniment because I've always cooked and eaten Cornish hens with tarty flavors like pomegranate. The duck triumphed as the best dish of the night. The duck breast was perfectly seared while the leg was braised with rhubarb presented, oddly, like Lincoln Logs. However, the bottom half of a side of rice was dipped in the leftover duck sauce and was an unnecessary addition. We were pretty much satiated with mediocrity by the time we had to order our desserts, so we opted to share the cake with blueberry compote because it came with olive oil ice cream. We just didn't want to waste any more food. At L'Ecole, the ingredients used were not a problem. I'm sure there are talented students at the International Culinary Center, but they need to tighten their execution and add some finesse in their cooking to translate what they want to convey on their diners' plates. I half-expected a professor in the kitchen tasting everything before going out, but it seemed like the students were pretty much on their own. Our waiter was really accommodating, but his every move was ruined by the too-lazy busboy who haphazardly stacked up all our utensils on our plates before briskly taking them way after each course-he just couldn't wait to get out of there. We couldn't either. Related post/s: SoHo needs better restaurants. Spend your $40 at Bar Bossa instead. At least, they're consistent. Savoy for local ingredients

I was attracted to this 1969 recipe Amanda Hesser featured in The New York Times a couple of weeks ago. There is no browning involved and I immediately thought that chicken can't be pretty without a golden brown crust. But then I remembered Hainanese chicken, a dish from the Hainan Island of China but perfected by those who immigrated to Singapore. This style is Canzanese-Canzano is in the Abruzzo region in Italy-but it's poached with wine instead of its juice alone. The pancetta gives the chicken some soul (Anthony Bourdain once said, All roads lead to pork), while the fresh herbs give it a fragrant smell as soon as you take the lid off and let out some steam. Ingredients: 3 chicken pieces 1 thick round of pancetta, cut into strips 1/2 cup dry white wine 2 sprigs rosemary 2 sage leaves 2 bay leaves 3 cloves 1 clove garlic, sliced lengthwise 2 peppercorns, crushed 1 dried red chili, crushed salt 1. Place the chicken pieces in a mixing bowl; cover with cold water and add 1 tsp of salt. Let stand 1 hour. Drain and pat dry. 2. Arrange the chicken pieces in one layer in a frying pan fitted with a lid and add the rest of the ingredients over the chicken. Add 1/4 cup water. Cover and simmer until the chicken is nearly done, about 40 minutes. Uncover and cook briefly over high heat until the sauce is reduced slightly.

Continuing my current love affair with kale, I followed another recipe Stacie of chowbaby.com recommended. I'm a bigger fan of savory rather than sweet and this pudding was just right up my alley. The bakery uptown didn't have brioche in stock when I stopped by, so I picked up a loaf of challah instead. Before tearing them into smaller pieces, I just tried to remove as many of the poppy seeds as I could. I also topped it with grated Gruyere cheese when I realized I still had some leftover in the fridge. The pudding cooked while I leisurely read The Sunday Times. It was such a low-maintenance pudding with a large yield. And even with the milk and cream, it tasted pretty healthy. Ingredients: 1 bunch kale, leaves torn from stalks, washed thoroughly half a loaf of challah bread, torn into smaller pieces 2 medium leeks, thoroughly washed, chopped a sliver of Gruyere cheese, grated 3 cups whole milk 1 cup heavy cream 4 eggs 3 cloves garlic, minced 2 sprigs of thyme salt, pepper, oil 1. Preheat oven to 450º. Toss kale leaves with a little olive oil. Spread out on baking sheets and roast for about 10 minutes. The kale will wilt and become slightly crispy. Transfer the kale to a bowl and set aside. Lower the oven temp to 400º. 2. In the meantime, saute the garlic and leeks in butter until leeks are soft but not browned. Remove from heat and set aside. 3. In a large mixing bowl, beat eggs, milk and cream together with the thyme and some salt and pepper. Fold in the kale and the leek mixture. 4. Pour the pudding mixture into a rectangular baking dish. Place the baking dish into a larger roasting pan filled halfway with water. Put the pans carefully into the oven. Cover the baking dish loosely with foil. Bake for 20 minutes. 5. Carefully take the pans out of the oven. Continue baking the pudding for another 20 minutes without the pan filled with water. Check to see if the pudding is cooked by inserting a toothpick in the middle. If the toothpick comes out clean, your pudding is done. Remove from oven, let cool slightly and serve.

how much is \"a bunch\" of kale? can you give an approximate weight, or something that we poor folks overseas can work with?
cia
2008-05-12 00:00:00
Good question. The bunch I buy in Harlem is pretty hefty and it's almost 2 pounds. Once you tear the leaves from the stalks, the yield should be enough to fill a medium-sized colander. They all wilt as soon as you roast them.

225 Park Avenue South at 18th Street 212/533.2500 about $40 each for four, with a pitcher of beer, with tip ♥ ♥ Sorry, we're out of the pork spare ribs. A long pause from our table and then, what do you mean you're out of the pork spare ribs? Well, you can try the Memphis-style baby back ribs instead. What time is it? Almost 7:30pm. And you're out of the ribs already? Seriously? I wanted to try Wildwood Barbeque because \"Big Lou\" Elrose of Hill Country was going to be handling the meat. You can say I was very disappointed when the dry-dusted pork spare ribs with Lou's sugar and spice rub were already out by 7:30pm. Between the four of us, we ended up sharing everything else in the pit barbeque menu. The Texas-smoked brisket, cooked \"low and slow\", was pretty good but it was even better with the house sauce. The Carolina pulled pork made my night because of the vinegar sauce that came with it. Both weren't as moist as I would have liked but delicious enough to enjoy with a side of smoked sausages and a pitcher of local beer. I tried not to eat too much of the corn bread to make room for the meat but I couldn't help but pick from the cast iron skillet it came in. The mac and cheese was indeed cheesy and it was definitely favored over the baked beans. The portions looked small though I felt like I had enough by the time the three smores came for dessert. Maybe it was good that I didn't have a tray of meat in front of me ala Fette Sau or Hill Country because I know I would have stuffed myself silly if that was the case. But not even a month old and they already can't keep up with the demand? I would have liked the option of saying no instead of being said no to.

When did sardine get a bad rep? When I mentioned that sardines were in the lunch menu, I got a mixed reception. From the wrinkle-of-the-nose kind of expression to the straight forward Ewww, I wondered what it was about sardines that turned some people off. It was different for me growing up. Sardines were affordable in the Philippines and if they weren't bought fresh from the market and then fried, they came in a can with spicy tomato sauce, eaten straight up or sauteed with onions. Fresh Portuguese sardines are pricey here in New York so to stay under budget and still cook for fifteen people at work, I stayed with Trader Joe's canned sardines in spring water. There was no salt added so the dressing here was quite perfect. Whatever seasoning the two mustards added, the celery's bite balanced off. This will remind you of a simple tuna salad, only a tad more sophisticated especially if served with rye crackers or warm flat bread. Ingredients: 2 cans of sardines in spring water, preferably unsalted, drained 1 bunch of celery hearts, finely chopped a handful of parsley leaves, finely chopped 1 tbsp grainy mustard 1 tbsp Dijon mustard 1 small red onion, finely chopped juice from half a lemon, plus some of its zest oil, salt, pepper 1. In a large salad bowl, mix the parsley with the olive oil, the grainy and Dijon mustards, red onion, lemon juice and zest. Add in the sardines, crushing a bit, and toss in the celery. Season with salt and pepper, adding a little bit more oil as necessary.

I had sushi with Stacie of chowbaby the other week and she told me about this quick yet nutritious dish she makes for her baby, Isaac. You gotta pay attention to a one-year old who eats kale; he's sure to go places. Today, kids just don't eat the bland slush we grew up with. Companies like chowbaby offer flavorful and exciting dishes made of organic ingredients frozen in convenient pouches which you can just heat up when needed. Can you imagine eating Moroccan couscous with raisins when you were a year old? Thank the stars for innovative and creative moms who think of solutions such as chowbaby to create future foodies everywhere. Anything good for baby Isaac is good enough for me. Ingredients: 2 bunches of kale, leaves picked from the stalks, thoroughly washed 1 cup white beans, soaked overnight 2 cups sundried tomatoes, chopped 3 cloves of garlic, minced 1/4 cup of balsamic vinegar oil, salt, pepper 1. Heat some oil in a large Dutch oven. Saute garlic until light brown. Add kale in batches and toss until wilted. Add white beans and tomatoes with 1 cup of water. Season with salt and pepper. Cover and let it simmer for 15 minutes to cook the beans and reduce the liquid. 2. When beans are soft, add balsamic vinegar and turn up the heat. Toss until the vegetables are covered with the vinegar. Related post/s: I like my kale with kielbasa sausage Part of my Mother Hen project: omakase bento #6 chowbaby: big nutrition for little people

I woke up early to stop by the farmers' market before work on Wednesday. I wanted some fresh bacon so I said hello to Mike from Tamarack Hollow Farm. He still remembers me as the girl who ordered half a suckling pig and a whole goose almost two years ago, and for that I remain loyal. With my nice slab of bacon, he also introduced me to a healthy-sized ham hock and rattled a recipe. I didn't write it down but four days later, I made up a recipe using the three words I still remembered: fennel, tarragon and braise. Braising is something I love to do during the colder months. Even though I used potatoes and beans in this recipe, the fennel and the tarragon made it more spring than winter. Instead of red wine, I splashed half a cup of the Austrian Gruner Veltliner I picked up from the store because of its beer cap and chubby bottle. The combination made a warm yet bright dish perfect for spring. Ingredients: 1 fresh ham hock 1 bulb fennel, sliced thinly 3 sprigs of tarragon, stemmed 1 1/2 cup of white beans, soaked overnight 1 leek, chopped a handful of baby carrots 4 white potatoes, peeled, quartered 1/2 cup of white wine salt, pepper 1. Preheat oven to 350º. Meanwhile, in a heated large Dutch oven, brown all sides of the ham hock until it has a nice golden color. Remove to a plate. 2. You should have some oil rendered from the ham hock. If there's not a lot, add some oil and heat it up. Saute the leeks until soft. Add the potatoes and cook until slightly brown. Add the tarragon, fennel and baby carrots and cook for 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. 3. Add the wine and the beans. Let simmer until the liquid evaporates a little. Add the ham hock in the middle of the vegetables. Cover and braise in the oven for 1 hour. After an hour, turn the ham hock, cover again and braised for another 30 minutes. Remove from the oven and let the pot rest, half-covered. When ready to serve, slice off the meat from the bone and serve with the vegetables.

354 Metropolitan Avenue near Havemeyer Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn 718/963.3404 about $60 for four, with a gallon of beer, without tip ♥ ♥ In case it hasn't been obvious, I love pork. I was having a bad day and all I wanted was to get a couple of drinks where I can sit outside and enjoy the warm weather. I wanted to forget, even for just a few hours, that a family member was in the hospital. I wanted good food so that I can feel happy in my stomach and then stronger in my heart to accept whatever bad news that may come next. I was even willing to take the L to Brooklyn to find that kind of comfort, as far away from Bellevue Hospital as I could. I was with great company including Scott Gold, the author of The Shameless Carnivore: A Manifesto for Meat Lovers, and we talked about the experiences he wrote in his book during his quest to eat 31 kinds of meat. (I don't want to ruin the book for you but among my favorites are the hunting for squirrels, salivating for the caribou and spitting out the bull's penis.) He shared his stories as we picked on the oh-so-moist and fatty brisket, spicy and snappy pork sausages and the perfectly cooked pulled pork. We couldn't deal without some veggies so we also ordered the broccoli and the potato salad-both helped cut the fattiness on our palates. The baked beans were barely touched but I saw through the empty glass gallon of beer by the time we wiped our hands clean with Wet-Naps. German for \"greasy sow\", Fette Sau not only provided a great place to enjoy the warm night air, it also gave me a chance to appreciate and enjoy what was around and in front of me: enjoyable company and a happiness-inducing plate of pork.

I've made salsa verde before using different kinds of greens: parsley, mint, basil and capers. This version fits its Spanish name more because it uses tomatillos, those green tomatoes you see in your grocery store covered in an onion-skin husk. Ingredients: 8 tomatillos, thoroughly washed, halved 1 medium red onion, chopped 1 bunch cilantro, chopped 2 Jalapeño peppers, stemmed, seeded, chopped 1/4 tsp sugar juice from half a lemon salt 1. Place tomatillos cut side down on a baking sheet. Place in broiler for about 8 minutes to lightly blacken the skin. 2. When done, pulse together all ingredients in a food processor. Season to taste with lemon juice and salt. Transfer to a large container with a seal. Let cool to room temperature before storing in refrigerator.

In a week's time, New York City has gone from spring to summer. Temperature was up 76 last week and I wore shorts to work. Good thing the produce at the farmers' market was still in spring mode because I couldn't have celebrated the warm weather without having my first ramps of the season. I got my early batch from Whole Foods for $19.99 a pound. F that! A bigger bunch in Union Square was $2.50 each when I stopped by the next morning. Because I was able to afford a few bunches, I decided to pickle them. Make sure you wash and clean the ramps thoroughly. From the farmers' market, the roots were intact. I cut them off and washed them with the water running; the onion skin from the stalks easily came off. I cut off and only left about an inch of the greens. I set the leaves aside for another recipe. Shichimi togarashi is a Japanese spice mix used to flavor soups and noodle dishes. You can buy a small bottle from Sunrise Mart if you're in Manhattan, or else make your own. Ingredients: 4 bunches of ramps 2 cups rice-wine vinegar 1 cup white sugar salt For the shichimi togarashi: 1 tsp red chili flakes 1 tsp sesame seeds 3 curls of orange peel a very small knob of ginger, peeled, crushed 1 sheet of nori 1. Bring all the ingredients, except the ramps, to a full boil in 3 cups of water until sugar dissolves. 2. In a pickling jar, place cleaned ramps and pour in the pickling juice. Using a small tea cup as weight, make sure that the ramps are completely submerged. Let cool to room temperature. 3. Seal jar and store in the refrigerator for about 5 days.

The ginger-garlic paste I made three weeks ago is proving to be very useful. I first made it for dilled vegetables when I started cooking for some of my co-workers. I have since used the batch I stored in the freezer for two kinds of kimchi and now for this dish. It's so much easier than peeling and chopping garlic and ginger all the time. And because they've been pureed together, the paste is much more fragrant. I love snapping a frozen sheet of it and just waiting for a few minutes before throwing it in a pot of vegetables. This is the first time I've cooked with black-eyed peas. I'm only familiar with it from Cameron's traditional New Year's dish. She made it for our group when we welcomed 2007 in Florida and again in Austin last January. This take is more northern than southern; in fact it's a northern Indian specialty in Punjab, Kashmir, Uttar Pradesh and Delhi according to Monisha Bharadwaj's India's Vegetarian Cooking. Ingredients: 3 cups of black-eyed peas, soaked in water overnight then drained 1 onion, finely chopped 2 tomatoes, chopped 1 tbsp ginger-garlic paste a handful of cilantro, finely chopped 1 tsp cumin seeds 1 tsp chili powder 1 tsp turmeric 1 tsp garam masala 1/2 tsp sugar oil, salt 1. Heat some oil in a large Dutch oven. Toast the cumin seeds until fragrant. Stir in ginger-garlic paste and cook for 1 minute. 2. Add the black-eyed peas and sprinkle in the chili powder, turmeric and garam masala. Cook for another minute. Add the tomatoes and sugar and season with salt. Mix and add 3/4 cup of water, cover and bring to a boil. 3. Reduce the heat and simmer until the peas are tender. Mash some of them to add thickness to the sauce. Turn off the heat and mix in cilantro before serving.

Dirty Rice with Brussels Sprouts and Tofu

***CONTENT
Southern cuisine's \"dirty rice\" gets its name from the offal pieces they add in their rice. Comfort food often contains more than its fair share of fried stuff as well as heavy starches and some people say \"dirty\" is also taken from that. I honestly fucked this dish up so I had to literally scramble and rename it \"dirty\". I stir-fried the Brussels sprouts and carrots with the salted black beans and then browned the tofu. When it was time to turn the tofu over, they just fell apart. Fuck it, I thought, and I just mixed everything together. Mark Bittman recently featured canned black beans and I immediately recognized them as the 89-cent cans I see in Chinatown. Filipinos call them tao-si because the black beans come from long string beans we call sitaw. Reverse that and you get taw-si. The spelling changed to make it sound more Chinese. Oh, those Filipinos! I knew they were salty-the beans, not the Filipinos-but not that salty, so I added rice to the dish to fix it up. Sometimes, the most wonderful dishes come out of mistakes made in the kitchen. Ingredients: 2 small buckets of Brussels sprouts, hard tips sliced off, quartered a handful of baby carrots, julienned 1 package of extra firm tofu, sliced into strips 1 can of salted black beans, drained 2 cups of steamed white rice juice from 1 lemon 1 onion, finely chopped oil 1. In a large skillet, heat some oil. Saute onions until translucent. Add black beans and cook for 1 minute. Add Brussels sprouts and carrots and stir-fry until carrots are tender. Set vegetables to the side and make room to fry the tofu. 2. Add some more oil if necessary. Brown the tofu on one side. When turning tofu over to cook the other side, they may stick. That's okay. You can mix them up with the vegetables and make a scramble. Add rice and continue to mix until fully combined. Add lemon juice to control the saltiness of the black beans.

Essentially, you are making -- because of the tofu and deliquesced onions and lemon juice which also breaks stuff down -- a mushy version of Gomoku Takikomi Gohan. The Japanese variant is crunchier. On the other hand, bringing in the taosi (豆豉?) as a player is way cool.

Twenty-four hours before, we were in Philadelphia, the so-called sixth borough of New York City. It was like summer and everyone was out walking and enjoying the weather. From the Reading Terminal Market, we picked up some purple potatoes and apples, a bunch of arugula and escarole. We planned to cook a nice fish dinner back in New York City with the fresh produce we stuffed in my canvas bag. Alas, there were no more whole fish at Eli's grocery store when we stopped by in the upper east side so we moved to Plan B. We bought two pork chops from the back and I thought of baking them with the Fujis. The Dr. was exhausted and just wanted to leave the cooking to me. I've done a similar dish before using red and white wines, but we were starving and this had to be fairly easy and quick. We snacked on the beef jerky we bought from Philly and drank the Hungarian red brought by co-workers from Budapest while we caught up with New York City news. Ingredients: 2 pork chops 1 Fuji apple, peeled, sliced 1 onion, finely chopped 5 small purple potatoes, halved 1 cup veal stock 2 tbsp mustard 1 tbsp brown sugar 2 cloves salt, pepper, oil 1. Preheat oven to 375º. Sprinkle pork chops with salt and pepper. 2. In a large skillet, heat some oil and brown the pork chops on both sides. Remove to a plate. Using the same skillet, saute onions while scraping the bottom of the pan to include the pork bits. Remove to another plate. 3. In a small bowl, combine stock with mustard, sugar and cloves. Whisk and season with some salt and pepper. 4. Transfer pork chops to a baking dish. Add potatoes around them. Top with caramelized onions and pour in flavored stock. Bake in the oven for 45 minutes, turning chops over during the last 15 minutes of cooking. Remove the chops to a chopping board and let rest while the potatoes roast for another 15 minutes.

402 West 43rd Street off Ninth Avenue 212/564-7272 about $190 for two, with drinks, with tip ♥ ♥ I remember my first time in Esca as if it happened just last week. The $700 bill was split in four, my purse let out a small cry and I hoped that the next time my friends from Ireland visit, I would be able to afford dinner without wincing at the price. Several checks from other restaurants have since surpassed that moment so I knew it was time to go back to Esca. I was with the Dr. and I was armed with a more sophisticated palate for Italian cuisine and seafood. So why did I think everything we ate was too salty? We were tempted by the crudo tasting. For $30 each, we could have had six appetizers served in two flights but we wanted to save our appetites for the beautifully described pasta dishes. We started with half a dozen of the oysters and the geo duck ceviche. I've never had geo duck but I've always wanted to buy it from Chinatown just for laughs. The texture reminded me of abalone-tender and a little tough, but wait...I've had better ceviche than this before. Where was the chili and lime essence? My tongue was desperate for that spike. The oysters from Oregon were perfectly briny and all I wanted from the ceviche was more ocean taste to compliment and prepare me for the rest of our meal. We had a very rich pasta course coming up so we decided to order two vegetable plates. The white asparagus was breaded and slathered with a thick sauce. I destroyed the brown crust-I wanted more asparagus than a fried casing. The insalata di porcini would have been my kind of salad if only it wasn't overwhelmed with the cheese. I loved the beefiness of the porcini mushrooms and I was all over the mache, or lamb's lettuce. I didn't think the dish needed anything else; the cheese got in the way of the salad's simplicity. We were getting disheartened and knew that we only had one more dish to lift our spirits. The guitar spaghetti with sea urchin and crabmeat was to rescue the night! Alas, what we hoped for was a more Japanese treatment of the uni-bright and yet subtle-but what we got was an overpowering taste of cream and salt. I wish they left the uni alone to do its job with the crabmeat. It was supposed to be a rich and graceful dish, not loud and overbearing. After two rhubarb bellinis and a panna cotta, we finished our meal and stepped out into the pouring rain. On our way home in the cab, we both wished Esca turned everything down a notch just like the faint tartiness in my drink and the delicate sweetness of my dessert.

I was tempted to omit \"or baby goat meat\" in the recipe title because grilled kid sounded funnier. This recipe is from Scott Gold's The Shameless Carnivore, a new book about, well, eating all kinds of meat. It's obvious from the title alone why I felt an affinity towards the book. His recipe called for cubed goat meat for barbecue and kebabs, but when I went to the farmers' market, Patches of Star Farm from Nazareth had already ran out. The lady sold me rib chops instead. I've had goat meat before but never this tender. It makes a huge difference when the animal is a young one. The younger it is, the more tender the meat. The chops weren't any bigger than my hand so they took less than 10 minutes to cook both sides. I served two chops to myself with a side of kimchi and some rice. Ingredients: 1 pound fresh baby goat rib chops juice of 2 limes half a bunch of cilantro, finely chopped 1 tsp ground cumin 1 tsp chili powder oil, salt 1. Combine all ingredients except goat in a bowl and whisk. Season with salt to taste. 2. Transfer the marinade in a shallow glass baking pan with cover. Add the goat, making sure all the meat is covered by the marinade. Cover and refrigerate overnight. 3. When ready to cook, heat a skillet. When almost smoking, add one or two goat rib chops at a time. Apply light pressure on the meat using a cast iron grill press or the back of a large spoon. Cook for 3 to 4 minutes per side.

These came out looking more like mini-sausages than authentic gnocchi. I'm sure any Italian grandmother will freak out if they saw how I made these at home. It seems like a lot of work but after you mash the potatoes, they kind of form themselves with just the help of some extra flour. It's helpful to have a Bravo TV marathon on in the background. If making ahead of time, prepare them on a baking sheet and put in the freezer for about 15 minutes. Then transfer them to a Ziploc bag and keep in the freezer until ready to boil. Do not thaw them out; just throw them in a pot of boiling water when ready to serve. Ingredients: 6 medium-sized Yukon gold potatoes, washed 2 bunches of spinach, thoroughly washed, chopped 1 cup flour, and more for dusting 1 egg oil, salt, pepper 1. Cook potatoes in a large stock pot with boiling water, about 25 minutes. Remove from water and let cool. When cool enough to handle, peel by gently shredding the skin off with a fork. In a large bowl, mash potatoes. Add flour and egg to the mashed potatoes and combine well. Season with salt and pepper. 2. On a clean table surface dusted with flour, form medium-sized logs using hands. Keep sprinkling flour as necessary to avoid potatoes from sticking to hands. Slice off small quantity of dough and form mini-sausage-shaped \"dumplings\". 3. In a large pot of boiling salted water, add the gnocchi and remove to a paper towel-lined plate using a slotted spoon when they float on top. 4. Heat some oil in a skillet. Fry the gnocchi until light brown on all sides. Remove to a serving plate and top with pesto. Related post/s: Part of my Mother Hen project: omakase bento #3 Make your own pesto

You can find smoked tofu from your Chinatown's refrigerated aisle next to the regular tofu. I order a spicier version of this salad whenever I'm in a Sichuan restaurant because I like the combination of spongy and crunchy textures. The tofu brings down the spiciness of the other dishes while the celery cleanses the palate. With a dash of red pepper flakes, this salad makes a good starter for non-Chinese dishes. Ingredients: 1 package smoked tofu, sliced thinly 5 stalks of celery, cut into matchsticks a splash of soy sauce a splash of rice wine vinegar red pepper flakes peanut oil salt 1. Heat peanut oil in a large skillet. Add the celery and stir-fry for 4 minutes. Add the tofu and continue to stir-fry for another 4. 2. Add a splash of soy sauce and rice wine vinegar. Sprinkle some salt and red pepper flakes. Toss and cook for the last 2 minutes. Related post/s: Try the Spicy & Tasty way in Flushing, Queens But the Grand Sichuan on St. Marks is closer

65 Fourth Avenue between 9th and 10th Streets 212/388.0088 about $40 for two, with drinks, with tip ♥ ♥ Shigemi Kawahara became Japan's Ramen King after winning three consecutive years in a TV program against other ramen chefs. After twenty years in business, people still line up outside his Ippudo branches in Japan. This East Village store is his first foray overseas. The pandemonium has now reached New York City and the wait for a table to eat ramen is already two hours long. Alas, Ippudo's reputation precedes itself. We put our names down around 7pm and bought a few drinks around the East Village before heading back to see if the maitre d' was any closer to calling out our names from her book. Two more Sapporo and Kirin drafts later and we were finally seated in front of the beautiful sequin piece in the back (next to chef Pichet Ong, no less). I immediately noticed the heavy wood interior when we walked in. Everything inside Ippudo looks expensive. I realized I've seen this kind of design before (Wagamama in London and Momofuku a few blocks away), but Ippudo presents itself quietly and with grace. Don't expect loud music inside; there's a buzz but it doesn't get as loud as David Chang's Noodle Bar. During opening week, they seemed understaffed because service was slow. The waiters were attentive but I just didn't want to wait for my food any longer after having already waited two hours. It's amazing how a simple food item like ramen can be glorified this way. There is no need to bill the Berkshire pork nor the organic ingredients. At Ippudo, it's all about the art involved in making the ramen. The high-quality ingredients just follow. We ordered the bowls Ippudo is well known for: Akamaru Shin-aji and Shiromaru Moto-aji. The akamaru was appropriately served in a red bowl (aka is \"red\" in Japanese) while the shiromaru was in a white bowl. (Shiro translates to \"white\".) The broth is milky white, a sign that pork bones have been simmered for a few hours, but it didn't have that slimy smell you usually get in regular ramen broths. It tasted of pork, but clean and rich at the same time. You don't begin to really appreciate the Ippudo signature until you start chewing on the noodles. Firm and tender noodles. I never had ramen noodles like this before even from the small ramenyas in Tokyo. They ran out of the kakumi, or pork belly with braised daikon radish, when we visited so we supplemented our ramen bowls with the Ippudo roll instead: grilled pork with custard and cucumber. We slurped loudly and happily, appreciating every effort that has gone to making each noodle the way ramen should be. Watch out Momofuku.

You can use almost any vegetable to make this dish at home. I chose potatoes and carrots because they are hefty enough to keep me full for a couple of hours. The spinach, I think, is a must-don't be afraid to use frozen spinach leaves if you want to skip the chore of washing them. Add some roasted butternut squash and you'll be more than set for autumn. I made my own ginger-garlic paste and froze them in batches. Store leftovers by spreading a small bit on Saran wrap. Top it with another sheet of Saran. Repeat until you have a small stack of ginger-garlic paste separated by Saran in sheets. Store in a resealable plastic bag and put in the freezer. If you want to skip that step, just add 2 tbsp of ginger cut in thin strips and 3 cloves of minced garlic. Ingredients: 3 bunches of spinach, rinsed thoroughly, chopped 3 potatoes, peeled, quartered half a bag of baby carrots 2 tomatoes, chopped 1 1/2 cup of lentils, washed and drained a handful of dill leaves, chopped 1 tsp turmeric 1 tsp chili powder 1 tsp cumin seeds salt, oil For ginger-garlic paste: cloves from 3 heads of garlic, peeled 1 large ginger root, peeled, chopped 1. Make ginger-garlic paste. Blend ginger and garlic together until smooth. Set aside. 2. Cook lentils. In a small saucepan, boil some water and add lentils. Cook for about 15 minutes, or until lentils are tender. Remove from pan using a slotted spoon, reserving some of the water for later. 3. In a large Dutch oven, heat some oil. Add the cumin seeds and toast until light brown. Then add a tsp of ginger-garlic paste and mix. 4. Add all the vegetables and the lentils. Season with salt. Add turmeric and mix. Put 2/3 cup of the lentil water, cover, and cook in low fire for about 35 minutes. Stir occasionally until carrots are tender. Some of the vegetables will be mushy.

I don't like broccoli but these sure were tasty, was one of the comments I received after including this in my first Mother Hen project for some of my co-workers. They were my favorite, too, because they came out bright green and perfectly tender. If you need to eat more greens, this is a good dish to start with. Ingredients: 3 bunches of broccoli, separated and cut into small florets 1/2 tsp cumin 1/2 tsp black mustard seeds 1/2 tsp turmeric 3 cloves of garlic, minced salt, oil 1. In a large skillet, heat some oil. Add the mustard seeds. When they begin to pop, add the cumin and toast until light brown. Then add and saute garlic. Add turmeric and mix. 2. Add the broccoli and season with salt. Add 2/3 cup of water and cook covered for about 5 minutes. Uncover and check if florets are tender. They should still be a bit crisp. Remove from heat and transfer to a serving plate using a slotted spoon. Related post/s: I served this with sweet potatoes Part of my Mother Hen project: omakase bento #1

Sweet Potatoes with Maple Syrup Glaze

I started what I call Mother Hen Project at work where I cook Monday lunch for up to five people for $5 a pop. I call them omakase bento so that I don't have to promise a menu ahead of time. They're stored in these neat lunch boxes I picked up from a Chinatown stationary store. I have plans to have a life, so I decided to do it only once a week. The demand's pretty good right now and I only have a few slots until the end of May to fill up. I hope they all like what they get. This sweet potato with maple syrup glaze recipe is matched with dilled vegetables with lentils, a seared Swai fillet and broccoli with cumin and mustard seeds. It's a tad sweet to clear the palate off the Indian spices. Ingredients: 3 sweet potatoes, rinsed, ends trimmed, peeled, cut into 3/4-inch rounds 1/4 cup maple syrup a small knob of butter a pinch of thyme leaves salt, pepper, oil 1. Toss potatoes with oil in large bowl; season liberally with salt and pepper. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and brush foil with some more oil. Arrange potatoes in single layer on baking sheet and cover tightly with aluminum foil. Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position, place potatoes in oven, and heat oven to 300º. Cook potatoes for 20 minutes. Carefully remove foil and continue to roast potatoes until they begin to soften slightly, 25 minutes longer. 2. In the meantime, make maple syrup glaze. Heat maple syrup, butter and thyme in small saucepan over medium-low heat until butter is melted. Remove from heat and set aside. 3. Remove sheet from oven and increase oven temperature to 400º. Once oven reaches 400º, return potatoes to oven and cook until bottom edges of potatoes are golden brown, 12 minutes. Remove pan from oven and brush tops of potatoes with half of glaze. If glaze becomes too stiff to brush onto potatoes, reheat it briefly. 4. Return sheet to oven and cook until bottoms of potatoes are golden brown and glaze begins to darken, 8 minutes. Remove sheet from oven and, using thin metal spatula, flip slices over. Brush second side of potatoes with remaining glaze. Continue to roast until bottom edges of potatoes are golden brown, another 8 minutes. Let potatoes cool for 5 to 10 minutes, transfer to platter, and serve.

They key to this dish wasn't as much as the garlic as it was the shrimp flavor from the head and the shells. I spent some time shelling and deveining a pound of shrimps, and my arm hurt from pressing them to get the juice out, but all the work was worth it. I used rigatoni pasta but they turned out to be too big for the small pieces of shrimps. When you try this, use penne instead. You can also substitute the vermouth with white wine. I just didn't want to waste a perfectly good and pricey Chateauneuf-du-Pape white-we needed another bottle of it after this very garlicky and very shrimpy pasta was done. Ingredients: 1 pound large shrimps, peeled, deveined, tails removed, cut into 3 pieces; heads, tails and shells reserved 1 medium-sized head of garlic, peeled, smashed, sliced 1 box of penne, cooked al dente, saving some of the pasta water 1 can of clam juice 1/2 cup dry vermouth 2 tsps flour half a bunch of parsley, finely chopped a small knob of butter lemon wedges, plus some of its juice 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes oil, salt 1. Marinate shrimps. In a large glass bowl, combine shrimp meat and a third of the garlic with some olive oil and a dash of salt. Set aside while you do steps 2 and 3. 2. In a large skillet, heat some oil. Add another third of the garlic with the shrimp heads, tails and shells. Cook and toss until garlic is light brown, about 8 minutes. Add clam juice and vermouth and let it simmer. Using the back of a large spoon, smash the heads so that the fat comes out. 3. When half of the liquid has evaporated, turn off the heat and remove the garlic and shells using a slotted spoon and transfer to a mortar and pestle in batches. Save the liquid from the skillet and transfer to another large bowl. Continue to get the remaining juice out of the heads and shells by pounding them with the pestle and transferring the juice back to the bowl. Discard shells when done. 4. Turn the heat back on and add a little oil. Saute the remaining garlic. Add the shrimp-flavored liquid and let it simmer until somewhat reduced. Then add the marinated shrimp and toss for about 2 minutes. Drop in the butter, flour and red pepper flakes and mix until butter is melted. Add salt and lemon juice to taste. Add pasta. If it gets too thick, add a drop or two of the pasta water. Turn off the heat and mix in the parsley.

End of Freeman Alley, off Rivington Street between the Bowery and Chrystie Street 212/420.0012 about $80 for two, with drinks, with tip ♥ Package something well and watch the people come. This seems to be Freemans' motto and it works. First, the location that still confuses people who do not hang-out in the area: where the hell is Freeman Alley? It's a nook off Rivington, right before you hit Chrystie if you're coming from the west. Then there's the design of the space: modeled after a country lodge, there are stuffed birds behind the newer bar inside. I never thought of having my own deer antlers in my apartment until I first stepped into Freeman's a couple of years ago. The owners, William Tigertt and Taavo Somer, know that New Yorkers love being a part of something cool. From secret entrances that Angel's Share made hip more than ten years ago, to douchebars blocked by big, burly men, we all like to brag that we got in before anyone else. In Freemans nowadays, you can count how many guys with facial hair are wearing fedoras and sweater vests under their blazers. After a while, everyone just looks the same. What doesn't change, though, is the length of wait and the service. I have spent an hour at the bar drinking with my friend waiting to be seated. I have also stood at the bar waiting to be seated at the bar. (Freemans only takes reservations for groups larger than six.) The other patrons can get testy and who can blame them when people hover, waiting to grab their seat? I have seen this happen where angry words were exchanged between hungry guests. The exhausted maitre d' also gets impatient. God forbid, you ask how much longer you have to wait. As soon as you're seated, you just want to eat. There was an Estonian empanada our waiter couldn't describe. I think the cook's mom is from Estonia, he simply said, before he walked away to mind the three other tables next to us. When he finally returned, he took our orders down and we waited another thirty minutes before everything was served all at once. We were eating our artichoke dip with our fennel salad and our main course of roasted cod. We never heard from him again until we waved to get our checks. Good thing I've had enough Rum Swizzles to numb the painful experience of trying to be hip.

Hi - I was researching 'grilled flying fish' and came across your photos on Flikr. May I enquire where you were when you took the photos? I lived in Barbados for a while and remember fying fish was a speciality there. You have obvious good taste and it is a pleasure to read your articles - Paul.

I love the flavor of curry. If I can roll over curry powder, I would. I love putting together different spices and making a definition of an entire cuisine with them. This recipe is from Stéphane Reynaud's Pork & Sons, the same book that brought pig's ears and trotters in my kitchen. I'm actually quite surprised that my infatuation with this book has lasted this long. This recipe intrigued me because of its use of fruits. Ingredients: 1 pound Boston butt, cut into cubes 2 bananas, cut into chunks before adding to the dish 1 tart apple, peeled and sliced before adding to the dish 1 cup of preserved pineapple chunks, drained 1 cup coconut milk 1 cup white wine 1 cup heavy cream 1 cup almonds, shelled 1 onion, sliced 2 tbsps curry powder 1 tsp ground coriander 1 bunch of cilantro, roughly chopped oil 1. Heat the olive oil in a large Dutch oven. Add the pork and onions and cook in medium heat, stirring frequently until the pork is evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Add the curry powder and coriander and continue to stir for 2 more minutes. 2. Stir in the white wine, scraping up the sediments from the bottom of the pot. Bring to a boil, and then lower the heat and simmer for 45 minutes. 3. Stir in the cream and cook for 15 minutes until reduced. Add half of the coconut milk and simmer for another 15. Add the fruits and the almonds and simmer for 5 more. Swirl in the remaining coconut milk and sprinkle with cilantro before serving. Related post/s: You don't have a copy of Pork & Sons?

Today is the official first day of spring and I'm in a good mood. The change of seasons make me look forward to what's ahead and allow me to start afresh. Forget the last three months of gloominess and cold weather; it's spring! It's the same warm and fuzzy feeling I get when I know I've made something awesome with my own hands. When I tried the first sandwich from this recipe, I couldn't help but go, Mmmmm. Making several more didn't take a lot of extra time; all I had to do was pick up the ingredients from Trader Joe's in one trip. The pesto gave this sandwich a nice kick while the scant sweet taste of the slow-cooked ham anchored down the two strong cheeses. Served pressed and warm and then cut in half to make the melted cheeses stringy, this sandwich made me proud. Ingredients: pesto Gruyere cheese, sliced Parmesan cheese, sliced slow-cooked ham sourdough bread a knob of unsalted butter, softened in microwave for 15 seconds 1. Spread one side of each bread slice evenly with some butter. Spread the unbuttered slice with a spoonful of the pesto and top with a slice of Gruyere. Add ham and then top with the Parmesan. Cover with the remaining slice, buttered side up. 2. Place large skillet over high heat and melt a small knob of butter. Reduce heat to low and add sandwiches. Using an iron grill press, put on top of the sandwiches and press. Cook until browned and crisp on both sides, about 2 minutes a side. Transfer to a platter lined with paper towels. Cut in half and serve. Related post/s: Pressed Taleggio Cheese Sandwich Pressed Reuben Sandwiches I got the Lodge Logic cast iron grill press

946 2nd Avenue between 50th and 51st Streets 212/355.6565 about $120 for two, with five drinks, with tip ♥ ♥ Depending on whom you ask, ceviche may have originated from Peru or Ecuador. Wherever your allegiance lies, it's seafood marinated in a citrus-based concoction to \"cook\" the meat without heat. Crave Ceviche Bar doesn't want you to forget what they're trying to serve you-everything is creatively \"ceviche'd\". I had fun determining which taste originated from where. The Kona Kampachi, my new favorite fish from Hawaii, was marinated in pressed lemons and tomato paste. The chorizo happily melded with the natural sweetness of the kampachi. The pure of artichokes and red peppers balanced everything out. Spain, right? I loved the salmon tartare in yuzu and huckleberry. A mess of galangal, capers and white truffle essence may sound confusing but for some reason works here. I couldn't miss its Asian-flavor galore. Throw in the oven-roasted tomatoes and cauliflowers and you have yourself some old Italian influence. We enjoyed the black cod sashimi with roasted beets and crispy latke ceviche'd in apple cider vinegar and yellow bean apple puree. It could be your next Hanukkah special! I found the spicy yellow fin tuna the most simple, but at least the yuca made it somewhat exciting. In a more hushed setting, restaurants like Le Bernardin have thrived in the New York City scene for years. Maybe it is Eric Ripert's footsteps that Crave Ceviche Bar is following. They have a raw section on the menu, as well as \"cured but cooked\" and also traditional dishes using shrimps, lamb loin and Peking duck in the same vein that their midtown counterpart has \"almost raw\", \"barely touched\" and \"lightly cooked\" selections. Each dish will set you back at least $14 with the most expensive topping at $28. Add the cocktails the cute bartender mixes behind their newly-licensed bar and you're looking for a $120 bill for two. After a couple of hours, we were tipsy and out of cash but still hungry. I can't explain how we ended up at a Japanese bar for a pitcher of Sapporo draft and a big bowl of pork belly soup afterwards, but Crave Ceviche Bar definitely made us crave some more.

Food Mission Accomplished in Trinidad

We were about to fly back to Trinidad to spend our last night in the suburbs. I still had a few things on my list of food to eat and frankly, I was ready to accept defeat with a frown. While waiting for our flight outside the Tobago airport, however, the Dr. found a small cafeteria that sold bake 'n' salt fish. It's the same fish sandwich like bake 'n' shark, only with dried salt fish, and usually served during breakfast. The bread was crumbly, almost like corn bread but white, and the fish crunchy and just had the right amount of saltiness. As soon as we landed in Trinidad, we walked up to one of the rental booths to pick up a car. It was only $15 more than the rental price in Tobago and if I was going back to New York without moping, a car was the only way that the Dr. can think of to make sure my food mission was accomplished. First stop: Maracas Bay for the famous bake 'n' shark from Richard's featured in Andrew Zimmern's T&T episode. After his first bite, he said it was the best sandwich he's ever tasted. Not in the country, but, like, ever. In Maracas Bay, there are plenty of food stalls waiting for beach goers to eat, but Richard's is supposedly the only one with a queue. But first, we stopped at a roti stand for lunch. We already had the buss-up-shut in Tobago, so this time we ordered the dhalpourri kind. Ground split peas is peppered in the dough, so at every tear, yellow powder sprinkled all over our plates and hands. My vegetarian version was filled with pumpkin, potatoes, peas and spinach, an amazing combination of colors and textures. I would skip the chicken filling for more of this if given another chance. Of course, we weren't going to finish our trip without a mishap. It took us almost an hour to get from the airport to downtown, past the lunch crowd and the heavy traffic. It was hot and hectic, two words I don't like about cities, and we were lost. Uh-oh, what is that? I asked when the car all of a sudden started to cough. There was something wrong with the accelerator. (The wha-?) We had to ask a mechanic from some gas station to call our agency and explain what was wrong in order to get a new car delivered to where we were. Oh, and rain! Pouring rain! We were forced to wait inside the food court of a mall filled with smoke from the burger joint until the car agency clerk came (through the same traffic, no less). Almost three hours after landing, we finally got a new car and started driving to Maracas Bay. The drive there lightened our spirits. It reminded us of driving in Kauai with its curvy roads hugging the cliffs. Going up the mountains, the air was cooler and the sun wasn't so fierce. We were definitely ready to leave the city behind. Forty-five minutes of beautiful scenery later, we slowed down to enter the lot to Richard's. It was in the parking lot across the beach and a TT$10 fee was required to stay and eat. But oh, Richard's, we were told, was closed for ten days. They renovatin'! My heart sank to my stomach. The Dr. looked over and he just knew. He knew that if we don't find bake 'n' shark soon, my chin will start quivering. Uncle Sam's to the rescue down the street. It was the only store open that late in the afternoon, but the short line was a good sign. We ordered two sandwiches and waited for our number to be called while we drank our first cold Caribs of the day. When we picked up our sandwiches, we added some green and chunky pepper sauce in it from the condiments corner. At first bite, the fish was flaky and warm. The white meat inside was deliciously tender and meaty. This wasn't like V's near Grand Riviere because it wasn't overcooked and deep brown in color. It was my second bake 'n' shark in the country and I still wasn't sure how to confirm that they really use shark. Both tasted like any other deep-fried white fish. Uncle Sam's version was so good, we can't imagine how Richard's could be any better. (And I'm not just saying that out of spite either.) It started to get dark when we drove down the mountain to the suburbs of St. Ann's and Cascade. An upscale neighborhood, we saw nice cars next to us and white people playing rugby in Queen's Park Savannah. Our room at Alicia's Palace had a view of downtown Port of Spain and included a patio overlooking the valley. There was a restaurant on the premises and we could have sat next to the pool and used the billiard table, but all I really wanted was more local food before we leave the country. After joining the residents for a jog up and down the hill, we cleaned up and started our drive back to the more harried part of town. Along the Savannah on Maraval Road were the Magnificent Seven, a group of mansions with European-style architecture but in dire need of repair. Under scaffoldings, they looked like giant gingerbread houses forgotten by time. We joined the early Friday party on the streets of St. James. We parked the car and walked until we spotted our first roti stand. We joined the line not to buy, but to ask where the other street food stands were. The old Indian lady pointed to the blue umbrella across the street. He was also surrounded by a small group of hungry Trinidadians and I tip-toed to take a peek of what he was making. As soon as I saw him scoop up a soupy channa curry on soft and fried bara bread and then add another under it, I knew they were what the locals call \"doubles\". I must have looked too eager because he made me sit down on a stoop right behind him while he prepared ours. He ordered the Dr. to buy cold beers from the bar down the street and gave us enough napkins to help us eat without pouring curry sauce all over our shirts. This is how you eat a doubles: Forget the bake 'n' sharks, doubles is where it's at. The next stop was the stand down the street with a stack of Styrofoam cups. The Dr. came up to the lady while I saved our seats on the stoop and asked what were in the plastic drums. As soon as she said pickled pig's feet, or souse, there was just no stopping him. Bright and tangy, pig's trotters are brined in vinegar and a concoction of cucumbers, chilis, onions and garlic. They're served cold, with tendon, skin and all, and you just have to use your hands to suck all the marrow from the bones. This is how you eat pickled pig's feet: We then crossed the street to get more beers and try the corn soup lady the next block over. Corn soup is corn soup, but the Trinidadian version was made of split-pea broth with chunks of corn and sticky dumplings. We had to walk around the avenue one more time just to make sure we didn't miss anything else. We were full, but it seemed silly to stop then. We were on a roll. We decided against another bake 'n' shark and a roti-they were to come as the next morning's purchases at the airport-and instead ordered more doubles and another serving of the pig's feet. Needless to say, we were content and happy that in one short night, I crossed off the last food item I wanted to try while in Trinidad and Tobago.

Our stomachs full of roti, we continued the drive on Windward Road to Roxborough. We saw the sign for Argyle Falls and decided to stop and walk off our heavy lunch. From the parking lot, we told the rangers that we didn't need a guide so they just let us walk to the falls ourselves. It was only a 15-minute walk on the well-paved trek. Cocoa and bamboo trees lined the side of the road. In the river, fish swam hungrily near our feet expecting us to throw them some food. The falls is the highest in all of Tobago at 177 feet with three main cascades. We were eager to move when we paid our entrance fee but not so eager to walk up the steep steps next to the falls to get a better view. We just hanged out and watch a couple take a dip in the pool. After Argyle Falls, the need for an afternoon nap set in. We stopped in downtown Scarborough to get gas and buy some fruits and vegetables for dinner. Inside the Penny Savers supermarket, the vegetables were as scarce as in Castara Bay. Luckily, we caught a glimpse of a vegetable market stand outside the parking lot. It was a small store full of vegetables and fruits that were local to the area. We happily stocked up on tomatoes and cucumbers, as well as a big chunk of watermelon. We continued on the airport road determined to end our day at our last beach stop in Tobago. Pigeon Point Road is where the Atlantic Ocean meets the Caribbean Sea. The sand was definitely more Caribbean than anything we've seen in the country: powdery and almost white. In fact, Tobago's best beach is Pigeon Point and they keep it that way by charging an entrance fee. Past the checkpoint, we parked out car and joined the revelers at the bar; there were no locals in sight except for the uniformed staff members and security guards patrolling the area. After a couple of beers and rum punch, we sat on the beach to while away the rest of our afternoon. I went in the water a few times to cool off while jet skiers, parasailers and windsurfers made noise in the background. The Dr. remained reading under a tree to avoid getting more burned. On our way out the gate, we noticed a couple of fishermen bringing in the day's catch from a boat. Intrigued, as we haven't really seen a lot of fishermen at work on Castara, we stepped out of the car to inquire if we could buy some of the flying fish in their basket. We imagined a civilized fish dinner with nice big salad for the night. The men were just waiting for a truck to pick up their haul. They told us that the fish will eventually end up in Europe's supermarkets. We bought six for TT$1 apiece and started off back to our car until one of the boys from the jet ski rental shop stopped us. He ended up inviting us to stay and join the rest of his crew for dinner. They were already preparing to grill theirs when we joined them with a few bottles of cold beer bought from the store down the street. We watched the sun go down and exchanged stories with the locals while we waited for our fish to cook. We told them about living in New York and they told us about growing up in Trinidad and living in Tobago. A few more men joined us by adding more fish on the grill. Using big leaves plucked from the trees as plates and our hands as utensils, we dove in and ate our grilled fish just like the rest of them. Back in Castara Bay, I put together our tomato and cucumber salad with the little we had in our makeshift kitchen. We ate our second course out in the patio and drank some more beers before retiring for the night. We were grateful for the invitation from the jet skiers and glad that we made new friends during our last night on the island. It just seemed like the perfect experience to end our stay in Tobago.

Windy Roads of Tobago: From Englishman's Bay to Speyside

We never really saw the rest of Trinidad because we only stayed in Grand Riviere, so during our second day in Tobago, I convinced the Dr. to rent a car from The Naturalist and drive us around to check some points of interest on the map. It was our fifth day in the country and our time there was coming to a close and yet, we still haven't had a decent cup of hot coffee. We signed all the rental paperwork by 8:30am (You told me it was 10am!), and as soon as he got the small Nissan up the hill from Castara Bay, we were on Northside Road to the next beach over, Englishman Bay. The long stretch of sand appeared untouched yet smooth, and not because of the time of day, but because the entire area remains undeveloped. Not even the familiar purple and poisonous balloon-looking Portuguese Man O' Wars were scattered on the beach. There was one restaurant but it was just opening up, so the lady could only offer us black coffee. It was still among the worst coffee I had in the country, but I needed the quick boost of caffeine which prepared me for the windy roads of Tobago. As the Dr. maneuvered the wheel from turn to turn, I cringed at every other speeding car or truck that met us head-on. I was on my toes the entire time and my shoulders hurt from flinching. I can't imagine paying attention to driving when your surrounding is a constant yet welcomed distraction. From the side of the road, I liked how below us was a grass-covered hill that rolled all the way down to the beach. Everything around was a rich green. And even though the sun couldn't decide whether to come out or not, the tropical breeze was enough to keep us content. It was finally time to eat something by the time we entered the town of Speyside. We parked our car across the large playing field where we were both welcomed and harassed by the local Rastas into giving them some change. I walked over to the bakery to buy something to eat for both of us and was quite disappointed that it was actually an abandoned storefront. The lady waiting for the public bus asked me what I was looking for. Roti, I said. I haven't had roti since we arrived and I really want to try them. And in that heavily-accented Creole English, she told me to go over to the bright yellow house across the way and buy them from there. I gathered the one member of my troop, went inside the yellow house and asked the big black momma inside for a roti. She said a lot that was undecipherable to me, but I ended up ordering two large rotis to eat right on the bench outside. I just know that there was a short lecture about how a small girl like me won't be able to finish a large-sized roti. All the signs we saw advertised \"hot, tasty roti\", much like how Mexico City had their \"rico tacos\" on every street corner. Roti, the country's unofficial national dish, is essentially a stretchy \"skin\" used to wrap curried meat and vegetables. In our case, we had the buss-up-shut, which is a thin cloth-like skin that was wrapped like a burrito. We tore the skin to scoop up the chicken, chickpeas (channa) and potatoes (aloo) inside. And hot and tasty they were. I returned to the store to proudly let the lady know that I finished the large roti. She showed her appreciation by giving us some water to wash the yellow curry off our fingers before we set off to the other side of the island. Our first ever Trinbagonian roti was enough to make up for the awful coffee.

I love Tobago-the calm atmosphere and the sun and clean water-I love the fried fish and bake and flying fish is a delicacy from Tobago-try this next-have some coconut or whole wheat roast bake next time-and have a fresh coconut water from thecoconut tree next time-stepping up 'bago style.I enjoyed reading your blog.

After an early ride to the airport from Grand Riviere, we boarded a 20-minute flight to Tobago. We felt very relaxed and we were ready to actually do some activities on the next island. I initially booked a place at The Naturalist, but a reservation glitch on their end left us without a room. To make up for it, the owner made sure we had a room next door, at The Sea Level, for our three-night stay on Castara Bay. He also had a car pick us up at the airport and bring us to this north western part of Tobago. I chose Castara Bay because it is touted as a fishing village where the Rastas still use a seine net to haul their catch. The Dr. expressed an interest in fishing and I was attracted to the laid-back vibe our guidebook mentioned, so I thought it would be the perfect place for both of us. We never got to see the fishermen use any sort of nets during our four days there (they just used plastic bins to carry them from the boat to the fish co-op) and the Dr. never had a chance to fish because he wasn't willing to pay for a US$250 charter boat, but we did use Castara as our base to see the rest of the island. The sand is smoother and more brown on Castara than it was on Grand Riviere in Trinidad. Most tourists come to Castara in the mornings and leave in the afternoon because they're staying elsewhere, so by the time the sun would set, we had the beach to ourselves. Our first full day, we signed up with King David Tours for a snorkeling excursion complete with a barbecue on the beach. The Dr. brought his fishing rod hoping to catch some fish for lunch with our two entertaining guides. Eleven of us boarded the boat and set off to our first snorkeling stop a few minutes away from Castara. I've snorkeled so many times during my travels and have seen some of the most beautiful animals underwater, but nothing prepared me for the gargantuan size of Tobago's fish. The usual parrot fish and yellowtail snappers were there, but imagine them five times the size you've seen them before. Imagine a school of anchovies swaying like a curtain in the water-oh, I just wanted to sashimi all of them right there and then. We made a couple more stops to try and catch fish, but they weren't biting. We just headed to No Man's Land for our lunch barbecue. No Man's Land is actually more like Every Man's Land. It seemed every tour operator in Tobago was there with the same idea. All the locals knew each other and shared the one grill setup on the island. We were surrounded by young Euros with weird haircuts (can you say double P Diddy-style mohawks?) who made noise like university frat boys. I entertained myself by watching our skipper prepare our lunch of tuna and cucumber salad. A concoction of garlic, coriander, Scotch bonnet peppers and onions was rubbed on the fresh tuna fillets and then wrapped in foil before setting on the grill. Everything else, like the chicken and the potato salad, were prepared beforehand. We drank the rum punch and cold Carib and Stag beers provided while we waited for our feast. After a very satisfying lunch, we boarded our boat again for our next stop. The Buccoo Reef is a protected marine park off Pigeon Point. Right in the middle of it was the Nylon Pool in all its emerald greenness. We were so far away from the beach, but this small pool of clear, shallow water was right in the middle of the sea. It was pretty cool and as you can see, it made for an interesting addition to my jumpin' photos. On our way back to Castara, the rain decided to pour and pour it did. Our entire boat group spent the last hour cheering every time we hit a big wave and smacked on the water. Red-faced and drunk, they all sang out loud while I cowered behind the Dr. to avoid the prickly pelts of rain. It was a long day in the water and under the sun and I can't say spending the rest of it in the rain was so bad. When we were completely showered and cleaned for dinner, it felt so good to be on steady land.

A Little R&R in Grand Riviere, Trinidad

Even the Dr. was surprised. It was already 10am and I was still sleeping. Granted, the new bed I was on was so firm that I slept like a log the last eight hours or so, but I was also on Day One of our first vacation together this year. Our usual version of vacation is, well, not exactly what our friends think it should be and every time we travel, I am usually jumping on the bed waking him early in the morning so that we can go, go, go. Maybe this trip was more necessary than I initially thought because we ended up spending the first three days sleeping in, taking several naps during the day both on the beach and back in our room, and retiring to bed early after a DVD or a bottle of wine. The term R&R never really made sense to me until after our trip to Grand Riviere on the island of Trinidad. After a five-hour deep sleep on the plane from JFK, we landed in Trinidad. Getting our luggage out of customs took a while, but as soon as we sat outside, Pierro came over to introduce himself. He owns Mt. Plaisir Estate on Grand Riviere, an almost two-hour journey from Piarco International Airport and our home for the next three nights. It was recommended to me by a fellow traveler at work after being warned that it should be kept a secret. I wanted to keep my promise, but after finding out that it already made The New York Times' Sophisticated Traveler list a few years ago, I thought that writing about Mt. Plaisir here won't be revealing anything new. Pierro asked us if we were hungry. I immediately said that I would like to try the Trinidadian \"doubles\", two fried flat breads, or bara, and topped with curried chickpeas. It was almost 3pm and the stand he frequents was already closed when we drove by. As a consolation, he introduced us to an iced cold sea moss drink at V's who also sold bake 'n' shark (or shark 'n' bake, depending on whom you ask), a deep-fried and battered shark sandwich. It's also one of the primary reasons that attracted me to the country. The sea moss drink is what it is: sea moss sun-dried and boiled for hours to extract its juice, and then mixed with some condensed milk and sugar before blending with ice. So, with some balata, a local fruit we bought from the side of the road, we had our first Trinidadian food experience. Pierro told us his story during our drive from the airport: he was taking photographs in Trinidad and Tobago about ten years ago and was staying in an old hunting lodge on Grand Riviere. When he found out that the place was for sale, he couldn't resist and bought the place. (How many times have I had that feeling but was too weak to do anything about it?) He ended up changing his entire life plan to build a home for himself and for other people looking for a place to get away from the hustle and bustle of bigger cities like Port of Spain and New York City. Before he bought the estate, there were a couple of trees on the premises. Today, the cabins are all surrounded by flora and the staff maintains a garden to supply most of the restaurant's ingredients. There are now thirteen cabins facing the Caribbean Sea with the rainforest as a dramatic backdrop. Indeed, Trinidad's location near South America make its landscape unique from the other Caribbean countries. I initially booked one of the rooms on the beach, but as luck would have it, we were moved to the room above the restaurant which included our own private patio. A mosquito net proved useful though still no match against the little buggers that ate the Dr.'s legs and my right arm. During the days when we actually exerted effort to walk around the small village, we searched for other food options and discovered Pinky's, where we were sold chicken stew and rice with salad or yuca on styrofoam containers, and McHaven's, where the rastas lazily hanged out all afternoon. Except for a curious gathering of cars with loud speakers on full blast in the parking lot behind Mt. Plaisir after sunset, all we heard were the sounds of the water crashing on the beach and the violent winds that came with torrential rains after we've turned off the lights at night. March is the beginning of the leatherback turtles' nesting season, so we also signed up for a permit to access the beach after 6pm via the visitors' center behind Mt. Plaisir. The area is the largest nesting place for leatherbacks in the western hemisphere and we were excited to get a chance to finally see them nest in person-we've seen the eggs buried in Nicaragua and the babies in Mexico-but alas, no one knocked on our door when we scheduled to go. The rain probably stopped the tour guides from doing so, but they didn't try us at dawn either. The nesting leatherbacks remain an elusive experience to us, but at least we've both caught up on much-needed R&R. Related post/s: Days 1 to 3 in Trinidad: Grand Riviere photos on Flickr Mt.

I was ready to spend the entire day indoors until my phone rang. It was the Dr. asking me if I was interested in having some lamb ragù for dinner. When he invites you over for a home-cooked meal, you just go. He's one of the best cooks I know who can move in the kitchen like no one's business. If you watch me cook, I'm all over the place, stressing out and trying to make sure I'm getting every step right. He makes cooking less of a chore and the end product is always top-notch. This lamb ragu from The New York Times Sunday Magazine is one of those recipes you keep and do over and over until you can cook it with your eyes closed. It was hearty and deliciously gamey in flavor, so after a big dump of snow here in the east coast, I wanted to make my own. They say patience is a virtue and you're going to need a lot of it for this dish. The key is for everything to be a deep brown color. It's a sign that all the flavors have been concentrated. While you do this recipe on your own, here's a video of my version simmering. Ingredients: 3 pounds ground lamb leg or shoulder 1 small can of tomato paste 3 cups red wine 1 large onion, chopped 2 carrots, chopped 3 celery stalks, chopped 4 cloves garlic, minced 2 sprigs of rosemary, removed from stem half a bunch of thyme, tied in a bundle grated Parmesan farfalle, cooked al dente garlic bread, toasted salt, oil 1. Using a large Dutch oven, heat some olive oil over medium heat. Sauté garlic until light brown. Add the onions until translucent. Add the vegetables, season with salt and cook until all the water has evaporated and the vegetables begin to brown, about 18 minutes. Stir frequently. 2. Add ground lamb, season generously with salt and cook until it is browned, about 25 to 30 minutes. Everything should be a deep brown towards the end. 3. Add the tomato paste and cook for about 5 minutes. Stir in the red wine, rosemary and bay leaves. Cook at a lively simmer until the wine has reduced by half. Add the thyme bundle and enough water to cover the lamb by about 1 inch. Simmer for 2 hours, stirring and tasting frequently and adding more water as it evaporates. Remove the bay leaves and thyme when cooked. Season to taste with salt and pepper. 4. To serve, pour over farfalle that's been cooked al dente. Grate Parmesan all over. Add toasted bread on the side.

After a family friend had a small heart attack this past week, my mother didn't necessarily start running on the treadmill. The family friend is, thankfully, okay, but now he has to change his diet. That at least made sense to my mom who bought a few packages of tofu to change hers. Well, at least, begin to change. She asked me for a recipe that's easy and quick to do. I want my parents to know that altering their traditional diet to a healthier one requires not much more work than what they're used to. If they start their meal with a light salad like this, then maybe they would be apt to eating less during the main course. At the least, there's a variety on their table when I eat with them. I always have Brussels sprouts on hand so I used a tub of them here. I sliced them in ribbons so that they would cook in less time and they could match the shape of the sliced tofu. This would be excellent with fried pancetta chunks, but I left that off just to teach my mom a lesson. At the end, the leaves were bright and the almonds added some crunchy texture for no more than 20 minutes of prep. Ingredients: 1 package of extra firm tofu, drained, cut into small and thin chunks 1 small tub of Brussels sprouts, tips cut off, then sliced so they are like ribbons 2 cloves of garlic, minced half a bunch of cilantro, roughly chopped a handful of sliced almonds salt, peanut oil 1. In a large skillet, heat some peanut oil and sauté garlic until golden brown. Add Brussels sprouts and season with salt. Toss in the almonds. Cook for about 5 minutes, setting them aside in the skillet after 3. 2. Add a little bit more oil and fry the tofu. Gently turn them over to cook the other side. It's okay that some of the tofu get crushed. Turn off the heat. Sprinkle in cilantro and toss everything together. Transfer to a salad bowl.

When my boss returned from our office in Budapest, he handed me two red packets of paprika. The developers we work with over there bought them for me because paprika is the most Hungarian thing that I could think of in terms of food. I'll just have to wait until I visit them myself to experience and taste everything else. I read that pörkölt is like ghoulash, a traditionally peasant and comforting dish for the Eastern Europeans. The most common version is to cook it with beef, but I used fish because I saw fresh Swai fillets in my grocery store. I also wanted to spend more time eating it with a glass of bold, red wine rather than actually cooking it. Swai, or Vietnamese cat fish, or basa, are inexpensive at $3.99 a pound. But feel free to use any other firm, white fish. Swai fish retain flavor and stay moist when cooking, so I found them ideal for this recipe. Ingredients: 2 Swai fish fillets, sliced in smaller pieces 1 green bell pepper, seeds removed, julienned 1 medium red onion, thinly sliced 1 tomato, quartered 2 cloves of garlic, minced 1/4 cup of regular paprika 2 tbsps of hot paprika sour cream salt, pepper, oil 1. Heat the oil in a large skillet and sauté garlic until golden brown and onions until translucent. Add tomato and green bell pepper and cook for 5 minutes while gently crushing the tomato. Season with paprika, salt and pepper. Remove everything to a plate and set aside. 2. Add a little bit more oil in the skillet. Cook fish fillet for about 3 minutes per side. Add the vegetables back and add 1/4 cup of water and lower the heat to simmer. You're done when the water has somewhat reduced. 3. To serve, top with a dollop of sour cream. Eat this with rice, pasta or lightly toasted bread. Related post/s: I've made a Hungarian recipe before: Beef with Vadas Sauce and Dumplings

There was half a cabbage head in the fridge that I didn't want to go to waste. I remembered the Dr. making us bubble and squeak throughout our stay in Iceland, making use of the expensive cabbage and potatoes available in the grocery stores we drove by. Locked up indoors because of a nasty bug, I made my version and tucked in with a bowl of it in front of The Millionaire Matchmaker. Vegetarians can make this without the pancetta, and vegans can skip the heavy cream if they roast the cabbage and the potatoes longer towards the end. Bubble and squeak is an English dish traditionally made with leftover vegetables from a roast dinner. I'm being traditional here because, hey, that cabbage was from the corned beef I made. Funny how cabbages last forever! I'm not quite sure where the name comes from. I think the bubble is from when the dish is bubbling hot. And the squeak? Well, we all know what a lot of cabbage does to you! Ingredients: half a head of cabbage, sliced in ribbons 4 medium potatoes, halved 1 medium red onion, sliced thinly 1 chunk of pancetta, chopped 1/2 cup of heavy cream 2 cloves garlic, minced salt, pepper, oil 1. Boil the potatoes in a pan filled with salted water until tender, about 25 minutes. Remove potatoes from the water. When cool enough to handle, slice the potatoes thinly. 2. Preheat oven to 350º. Using an oven-safe skillet, heat some oil and render the pancetta. Sauté the garlic and onions. Add the cabbage. Season with salt and pepper. Toss and cook everything together until cabbage is soft. Spread the potatoes on top, covering the cabbage. Pour in heavy cream. 3. Roast in the oven for about 10 minutes or until bubbling hot. Remove from the oven, toss and serve with gherkins.

In Michael Pollan's latest book, In Defense of Food, he summarizes his lecture on the first page: Eat food. Not too much. Mostly greens. I love greens, but I also love all kinds of meat. And you know how I feel about bacon, right? But there are days when I do crave vegetable-only dishes. I run to Joe's Shanghai for their baby bok choy flash-fried in garlic and hot oil. I go to Snack for their artichoke salad sans the chicken. Sometimes, I even go to my local deli's make-your-own-salad counter and pick from the available ingredients just to get my fix. And when I eat my meat, there's always a side that involves a vegetable. You can use almost any kind of greens here. I used Chinese spinach because that's what I had in the fridge. Regular spinach, watercress or bok choy will do, too. They key is to simmer everything for a long time, so that the broth thickens with all the carrot and celery goodness. You'll get more of the lentils' earthy taste in the end. If you can deal with the extra work, use a hand blender and purée the entire batch before serving. When they've cooled down, transfer leftovers in quart containers and store in your freezer for up to two weeks. You can just thaw and heat one up when you want another serving of hearty lentil soup. 2 1/2 cups of lentils, rinsed 4 stalks of celery, chopped 1 bag of baby carrots, halved 1 bunch of greens vegetable broth 1 tomato, quartered 1 red onion, thinly sliced 2 cloves of garlic, minced 1 tbsp of coriander, toasted, grounded 1 tbsp of cumin, toasted, grounded 1 tbsp of cardamom, toasted, grounded salt, pepper, oil 1. In a large Dutch oven, heat some olive oil. Sauté garlic and onions. Add the carrots and celery and cook until glistening, about 8 minutes. Add the lentils, tomato and the spices to combine. Add enough broth to cover. 2. Bring to a boil and then reduce heat. Cover and simmer until lentils are tender, about 40 minutes to an hour. Season with salt and pepper before serving.

Robert's Steakhouse at the Penthouse Executive Club

603 West 45th Street off Eleventh Avenue 212.245/0002 about $90 each for a group of six, with drinks, with tip; dances were separate ♥ When a friend of mine told me about an upcoming girls' night out that involved going to a strip club, I immediately said yes after I confirmed that they wanted to see girls stripping, not boys. Just right up my alley because, really, naked boys are not as nice to look at. Speaking from experience, I told them that we can only go to Penthouse on the West Side highway because it's the only club that will allow a group of man-less women to enter. It's a ridiculous rule, but we had no choice in the matter. I was told that girls do not buy as many drinks as guys, and if they're not that drunk, they won't be buying as many dances. Whoever came up with that had obviously no clue who we were. Our table was for 7:30pm. Our party of six wasn't completed until 8, but they let us sit and wait at our table next to a pole dancer. We all decided that an expensive bottle of red wine might just make us too sleepy, so we ordered our martinis. Drinks were $20 each even if you were just getting vodka with soda. At Robert's Steakhouse, they didn't discriminate: my friend's first lap dance was at $40, the same price charged to the guy sitting at the next table wearing a crisp suit. The girls dancing in the corner told us they can't come to our table because they don't do lap dances, so we had to wait for the others to approach us. After several drinks, we were brave enough to go up to a girl we liked and pay for our own. After more drinks, they just came up to offer us a dance. But this is a review of the food, and I must tell you that a hundred-dollar porterhouse steak is much better with some form of entertainment. We only managed to finish one porterhouse and I felt bad when we had to leave the other one barely touched. I suppose I could have sat there and finished it for the next two hours, but my friends were eager to go downstairs and meet the ladies. (One said, You don't want to smell like meat when the girls dance for you.) We had the steak packed to go, but after several hours of giving away Andrew Jacksons, no one knew who ended up taking the extra food home. After several hours of $20 drinks, too, no one knew what the hell was really going on. I do remember the delicious bowl of Brussels sprouts. The creamed spinach and roasted potatoes were also good matches to our meaty, charbroiled steak. Whoever was in the kitchen wasn't distracted by the view we were getting. Adam Perry Lang, the restaurant's executive chef, also co-owns Daisy May's BBQ a block away. He ages and cooks the steaks in a broiler with two different temperatures so that the meat gets seared the right way without sacrificing the juiciness of the inside. And boy, were they juicy. I love my meat bloody and buttery, and Robert's Steakhouse served a mean plate of it. Be thankful that this is only a review of the food.

Feeling a lit bit under the weather, I've asked Cameron to guest-blog about the wine tasting we attended at Union Square Wines in New York City. Thanks, Cameron! The Chateaneuf-Du-Program: Le Vieux Donjon 2003 Clos des Papes 2004 from Magnum Domaine du Grand Tinel 2005 Cuvee Alexis Establet Clos Saint Jean 2005 Cuvee Vieilles Vignes Domaine Charvin 2005 Domaine du Pegau 2005 Cuvee Reservee Chateau de Beaucastel 2005 Domaine du Vieux Telegraphe 2005 Domaine de Beaurenard 2005 Cuvee Boisrenard I arrived at Union Square Wines to meet Cia on an unexpectedly chilly January night, ready to warm up with some nice reds in their Pape Stars Part One: The Golden Age of Chateauneuf-du-Pape: The Golden Age of Chateauneuf-du-Pape tasting. I'd been willing to overlook their puzzling use of italics in the event description, as my knowledge of these wines was pretty much limited to the pronunciation of the region's name. A small crowd had assembled in the middle of the store by the time I joined Cia, and it was only a short wait before they welcomed us into the back tasting room of the store. The first thing I noticed upon entering was the delicate placement of no less than 32 glasses of wine on each small round table. You know that person whose presence at a table guarantees that it's only a matter of time before something gets knocked over, spilled, or broken? That's me. I took my seat with trepidation, trying not to touch anything, as the tasting commenced. The first ten minutes were filled by Wine Director Jesse Salazar's effusive introduction of Chateauneuf-du-Pape, the current darling of oenophiles everywhere, and even more effusive introduction of special guest host Adrian Chalk, clearly a darling of the New York wine scene. Turns out it was well-deserved; Adrian's knowledgeable and eloquent presentation of the C-d-P region and the particulars of each of its wines made the tasting worthwhile. I've always loved Grenache (and my familiarity with it has come a long way since I first ordered a glass of \"Gre-nach-ay\" at The Room a few years ago), but I had no idea that Chateauneuf-du-Pape wines are characterized by the presence of its luscious, bold grape. Predictably, my favorites were the heaviest on Grenache-a pure-Grenache Domaine du Grand Tinel 2005 Cuvee Alexis Establet was the only red Cia and I ended up taking home at the end of the evening. As far as the actual tasting went, we had fun laughing (especially as the night bore on) at our appraisals: I would detect strawberries at the exact same moment that Cia would exclaim that the same wine tasted like leather. Our tasting companions seemed to have the lingo down, citing things like \"tannic euphoria\" and \"fennel on the nose.\" This also became increasingly hilarious as the night bore on. Of course, the problem with wine tastings, as anyone who has ever enjoyed a tasting menu with wine pairings can attest, is that by the time you get to the good stuff (the main courses and dessert, or in this case, the really expensive wines), you're just drunk. The last few wines came with florid descriptions and price points to match, but all we could say was that they tasted like wine. By that point, we were also near hysterical about the absence of the promised spread of Murray's cheeses. We did get our cheese (and meat and bread) in the end, but we were no closer to getting what was so great about these expensive bottles. All the better for spending that $50 wine voucher that came with the price of admission wisely, I suppose. I liked this tasting not only for Adrian Chalk's excellent presentation, but also for the discovery that all these wines from the same region really do taste different in ways both simple and complex. I loved hearing about how the tastes were affected by things like a rocky landscape in which sunlight reflected off the stone, creating intense heat. I was intrigued to hear how these sophisticated wines are born of a hellish landscape (the conditions are so hot and inhospitable, the soil so hardened with clay and rock, that Caterpillar tests their machinery here). I was excited to taste a white Chateauneuf-du-Pape on top of all those better-known reds; it turned out to be one of my favorites. And all night, even after ten wines and several trips to the cheese plate, I didn't spill a drop. Related post/s: Check out Union Square Wines' calendar of events

Cook's Illustrated's Stuffed Portobello Mushrooms

I don't cook like this. But because I was testing a recipe for Cook's Illustrated, I knew I had to follow their instructions as much as I can to get the results they were trying to achieve. When I first got this recipe in my inbox, I thought, No meat? I was ready to reject the test but decided at the last minute that maybe a meatless recipe (well, except for the pancetta chunks) will be more of a challenge for me. Besides, I still shudder when I look at mushroom pleats, so I thought this was a good attempt to overcome my so-called fear. America's Test Kitchen's goal with this stuffed portobello mushroom recipe was to get an intense mushroom flavor without the gumminess of other recipes they've tried. I think I achieved that when I tried it at home, but it sure did take a lot of time and ingredients to try and get everything right. After cooking, I answered the questions associated with the recipe and put in my two cents. I noted the adjustments and substitutions I made. I used more oil than the recipe suggested when brushing the mushrooms for roasting. I also used salted butter instead of unsalted, so I eliminated the required salt when I was rendering the pancetta. It also called for lemon juice, but I didn't see it used in the steps. An honest mistake? Perhaps. It could have been a test to see if I was paying attention. I realize now that writing recipes that everyone will interpret correctly is a difficult job. What makes sense to me may not mean the same for other people. I wonder how many people out there try the recipes on my blog and get confused? Are you one of them? Below is my edited version of their recipe. Click any of the photos for the complete set. Ingredients: 6 portobello mushrooms, stems removed and reserved, caps wiped clean with a paper towel 3 slices of white bread, pulsed in food processor to make breadcrumbs 1/4 cup of pancetta, diced cheddar cheese, chopped to fill 1/2 cup 2 tbsps heavy cream 1/4 cup sherry 1/4 cup parsley leaves, roughly chopped 1 tbsp thyme leaves 2 medium onions, finely chopped 2 garlic cloves, minced 2 tbsp butter salt, pepper, oil 1. Move the oven rack in the upper-middle position. Preheat oven to 400º with a baking sheet inside. 2. Make a criss-cross slit on each of the 4 portobellos. Brush both sides with oil. Chop the other 2 and set aside for later. Place the 4 mushrooms on the pre-heated baking sheet, pleats side up. Roast until their edges are a bit brown, 10 minutes. Carefully flip them over and continue to roast until the liquid has evaporated, another 10 minutes. Remove the mushrooms from the oven and heat the broiler. 3. Using a large skillet, heat some oil. Add the butter and swirl in the oil until melted. Add the breadcrumbs with a pinch of salt, stirring frequently until golden brown, 6 minutes. Transfer crumbs to a large bowl. 4. Wipe down the skillet with a paper towel. Heat some oil and add the pancetta until some fat is rendered. Using a slotted spoon, remove the pancetta and transfer to another large bowl. 5. Add the chopped mushrooms and cook in the rendered fat without stirring for 3 minutes. Add 1 tbsp more of oil and continue to cook the mushrooms for another 3 minutes, stirring this time. Season with some salt. Transfer to the bowl with the pancetta. 6. Add more oil to sauté the onions and the garlic. Stir in sherry and cook until almost no liquid remains. Stir in thyme, parsley, cheddar cheese and heavy cream with the pancetta. Season with salt and pepper and toss until cheese is melted. Your filling is done. 7. Flip portobello caps. Spoon this filling onto the mushrooms. Top with breadcrumbs. Broil mushroom until the crumbs are golden brown, about 2 minutes.

Makizushi with Pickled Vegetables

Among my purchases at the Mitsuwa Marketplace in Edgewater, New Jersey, were Japanese produce I rarely see outside of New York City's Sunshine Mart off St. Mark's Place. I was so excited to see yamagobo, or Japanese pickled burdock, because I have never eaten those outside of Sushiden. The pickled radish, or takuan, was more familiar, and of course, so were the shiso leaves. These three ingredients inspired me to make my own makizushi at home. I learned to order them from the Dr. after every sushi and sashimi meal at Sushiden. He just asks the chef for the three ingredients, and voila, small hand rolls are served. A few months ago, I had picked up some soy skins in lieu of nori, or Japanese roasted seaweed, and I was glad to finally use them here. (Don't worry, I'm not turning vegetarian. I bought them because they looked really pretty.) They didn't add anything special to the rolls and I still preferred the nori over them, but they made colorful presentation when served with fried lotus root. I'm not going to get into the proper way to make sushi rice and all that, but you'll need a Japanese bamboo mat to make respectable rolls. In a pinch, you can user Saran wrap, too, just don't let your Japanese friends know. Ingredients: yamagobo, drained, chopped takuan, drained, julienned shiso leaves, chiffonade sushi rice, cooked mirin, or rice wine vinegar nori wasabi, optional 1. Place nori on a Japanese bamboo mat. The mat should lie so it rolls away from you, not from side to side. Keeping your hands moistened with vinegar-water, put a scoop of sushi rice in the center of the nori and spread evenly on top of the seaweed. Spread a streak of wasabi across the middle if using, then add a layer of the vegetables across the center of the rice. 2. To roll, fold the bamboo mat so the filling is enclosed in the center of the nori, then moisten the top edge of the nori and seal the roll tightly so that it won't fall apart when sliced. 3. Remove the mat from around the roll, seam side down. Slice the roll into one-inch rounds straight down using a sharp knife or serve as small rolls to eat with hands.

so funny; I was at ushiwakamaru recently and had asked for a vegetable roll, using all of the veggies they might have behind the counter, and asking as well for burdock (what I know as a brown thing, folded usually and rolled into maki) but getting instead this spicy marinated vegetable that looked (and tasted) suspiciously like carrot. I thought they were screwing with me when they said that was burdock, because to me, it really was carrot-y. and lo and behold, the picture in your post above is what we had! except, very spicy. good tho.

I was watching a rerun of an Andrew Zimmern episode shot in Barcelona where he came across some quail eggs, pointed at them and said, Quail eggs; we don't really see that back at home. I found the comment odd because I see them every time I go to Chinatown. And as far as I can remember, we often had them stocked. In fact, I had a dozen in the fridge! I usually like to boil them, peel off the shell and throw them in a wok of stir-fried vegetables, but over the weekend, I was inspired to fry them for breakfast and eat them with chistorra, a semi-cured sausage from Spain I picked up from Despaña. You probably make your own breakfast already, so why not use different ingredients the next time? This is very lazy, but the presentation looks like you made an effort. Ingredients: quail eggs chistorra sausages, halved lengthwise oil Optional: mozzarella cheese basil leaves tomato baguette, toasted 1. Using a small skillet, heat some oil. Fry sausages until light brown. If you have a grill press, use it to press the sausages down. 2. In the same skillet with the rendered sausage fat, fry the quail egg like you would a regular egg, but keep watch: it's smaller and will obviously cook faster. 3. Assemble on serving plates any way you like. Feel free to add mozzarella cheese, basil, tomato or toasted crusty bread.

I've been wanting to return to Mitsuwa Marketplace in Edgewater, New Jersey, since the Dr. and I first visited after watching the Romeo and Juliet opera in HD. I've also hassled all my friends who have cars to drive me there ever since Anthony Bourdain featured the area in his Food Network show a few years ago. After enough whining from me, Veronica finally relented and picked me up one Saturday afternoon to eat at the Japanese food court and pick up groceries. After filling ourselves with ramen, tonkatsu and pancakes, plus an exciting trip down the aisles of the Mitsuwa grocery store, we ended up in Trader Joe's where I picked up my favorite dried fruit snacks and at Cafe Archetype where we finished our day with green tea au laits. You see, New Jersey ain't so bad. Kanitama, or crab-egg, omelet on top of rice from China Table Tokyo Hanten was filling. A delicious bowl of pork salt ramen sprinkled with a red pepper powder from Santoka. A satisfying bowl of hot miso ramen, also from Santoka, was never finished because we were all full after several other dishes. A delicately-sized bowl of udon came with pork tonkatsu and rice from Kayaba, next to Santoka. Mitsuwa Marketplace is on 595 River Road, Edgewater, New Jersey, just over the George Washington Bridge.

Pig's Feet With Caramelized Onions

With all the fish I've been eating the past week, it was time to go back to pork. What better way to celebrate my return than to, ahem, trot back to the kitchen with pig's feet. This is another recipe from Stéphane Reynaud's Pork & Sons. If you can get a glimpse of the book, turn to page 190-you'll want to make the recipe at home, too. In Chinatown's Deluxe Food Market, pig's trotters are less than $3 for a pair. If you can't find them in the frozen section, get one of the Chinese men's attention and say \"feet\" while pointing at your shoes; one of them will surely direct you to the right shelf. The original recipe uses walnut oil to bring out the richness of the feet. I didn't want to spend $12 on a bottle from Dean & Deluca, so I stuck with my good olive oil at home. I think I achieved what the author was thinking of here. The funny thing about pig's feet is that people forget that it's not offal. Sure, a foot is an odd part of the pig to be eating, but you don't eat it like you do chicken's feet at dimsum. (I've never heard of pig's foot in a stick either.) It takes a couple of hours to make the feet soft and when you take them out of the boiling water, the meat and skin fall off the bones easily. They are rich in fat content and very gelatinous, so you get the same fatty meat that you do from a very Filipino pork adobo. It's all that fat you can be squeamish about, not which part it came from. Ingredients: 2 pig's feet, thoroughly rinsed 4 strips bacon, chopped 2 carrots, peeled, chopped 1 white onion, halved 2 red onions, thinly sliced 1 bunch scallion, chopped half a bunch of parsley 2 bay leaves 1 tsp brown sugar 1 tbsp balsamic vinegar chives, chopped salt, pepper, oil 1. In a large Dutch oven, put the feet, bacon, white onion, carrots, scallions, parsley and bay leaves with enough water to cover. Cover and bring to a boil, then lower the heat and simmer for 2 hours. 2. While waiting for the feet to soften, heat some oil in a skillet and sauté 1 red onion and cook until soft. Set aside. 3. After 2 hours, remove the feet and bacon from the pot using a slotted spoon. Using a fork and a knife, separate the meat and the skin from the bones. This should be fairly easy. Discard the bones. 4. Chop the bacon. Combine the sautéd onion with the feet meat and skin plus the bacon. Season with some salt and pepper. Using a Saran wrap, spoon the mixture and arrange like a sausage. Cover and roll like a tight, big blunt. (Oh, come on. You know.) Put in the freezer for 30 minutes. 5. While waiting for the pig's feet sausage to form, caramelize the last red onion by sautéing some hot oil in the same skillet and mixing with brown sugar. Set aside for topping. 6. Make your dressing. Whisk together some olive oil and balsamic vinegar. 7. After 30 minutes, preheat your broiler. Remove the feet from the freezer, unwrap and cut into 1/4-inch-thick slices and place on an ovenproof serving plate. Heat briefly in the broiler, just enough to warm the meat up, less than 5 minutes. To serve, top with caramelized onion and chives, and then drizzle with oil-balsamic dressing.

It really can't get more decadent than this: one of my favorite sausages happily marinating in the finest olive oil and fresh herbs. Well, okay, add foie gras and you're really set. But this is so easy; requires only a week of preserving and you have yourself about two weeks' worth of appetizers. Ingredients: a chunk of good quality soppressatta, sliced thinly 2 sprigs of thyme 3 sprigs of rosemary 10 juniper berries 1 garlic clove, crushed 1 bay leaf olive oil baguette, to serve 1. Place and arrange the soppressatta slices in a pickling jar with herbs and spices. Pour in olive oil to cover. Seal tightly and store in the fridge for at least a week. 2. When ready to eat, scoop out a serving or two onto a plate and microwave for 15 seconds, or enough to melt the olive oil. Serve with toasted baguette and a nice glass of red wine.

I was wondering where I saw this! made this recipe from memory (well, it ain't that hard) after thinking I had seen this somewhere else. my mistake? using cheaper olive oil and also a mix of fresh and dried herbs (what can I say? I was prepping this in my office). added a ton of chili flakes though. but after about 3 days, the flavor unfortunately wasn't getting deep so I kept it for a few more days, took it to a superbowl party, removed the oil and used it to drizzle over cubed potatoes and roasted those for about 45 minutes and then dumped the salumi back over the potatoes, and threw the whole pan into the oven for about 10 minutes. sorta like a meaty papas bravas I think, and went over well w/ the giants-rooting crowd.

I can't believe 2007 passed without me cooking anything for my Global Gastronomy project. Bad, Cia! I have at least four pending recipes from acquaintances and friends, but c'est la vie, the year went by just like that. Over the weekend, it was colder in New York City than it was in Budapest, Hungary, and their city experiences what they call a Russian front. Canadian front? Meh! It gets cold over there. I work with a few talented boys based in Budapest. We talk every morning over IM. If work doesn't get in the way, I get a spatter of Hungarian words in exchange for some quirky American slang. They know about this blog and we are each other's contact on Flickr, so when I asked one of them, Keki, to send me a family recipe, there were no questions asked. He said he had to use the dictionary a lot to translate his mother-in-law's handwritten recipe, so I was very grateful when I received two: a vadas sauce to go with beef and the dumplings to complete the meal. Vadas comes from vad, which means \"game\", and Hungarians make the base of the sauce using all kinds of gamey meat. I used beef to make it less difficult. My arms got tired when I tried this at home and I understood why Hungarians don't make it often. You need at least a day to marinate the beef and a couple of hours to get the sauce and the dumplings done. Keki said that his mother-in-law makes a wicked version, and because they're not readily available in restaurants, he looks forward to eating it. Even the kids love it, especially before they find out that the sauce has carrots in it. When I let Keki preview the photos I took, he gave me the biggest compliment: he said he \"felt the smell of vadas\" even though mine looked more orange because of the extra carrots I put and seemed a little thicker than what he was used to. I could have used a full cup of sour cream to make it less orange-apparently, a lot of sour cream is very Hungarian. I thought I did better with the dumplings because I've had the Czech version, knedlicky, when I visited Prague. If your vadas sauce is creamier, you can sop the dumplings while you eat the beef. When I finally sat down to eat, a wish to visit Budapest sooner than later floated in my head. Thanks, Keki. Ingredients: 2 pounds beef tenderloin 4 slices of bacon, chopped 3 carrots, peeled, chopped 2 onions, chopped 1 parsnip, peeled, chopped 3 bay leaves 2 tbsps of flour 1 cup sugar 1 tbsp sour cream 1 tbsp mustard lemon juice salt, pepper, oil For the dumplings: 1 baguette, torn in smaller pieces, toasted whole milk 2 eggs 2 tbsps flour a knob of butter, melted salt 1. In a nonreactive pot, render some bacon fat. Add the beef and brown on all sides. Move the beef to the side while you sauté the onions. Add the carrots and the parsnip and cook for about 5 minutes. Don't forget to turn the beef to avoid burning. Add enough water to cover and toss in the bay leaves and some pepper. Cook in low fire for about 3 hours, covered. After 3 hours, let it cool and store in the fridge for up to 24 hours, turning the beef occasionally. 2. When ready to cook, remove the meat from the water and set aside. Save some of the water. Using a slotted spoon, remove the vegetables and transfer to a large bowl. Mash. 3. Make the dumplings. In a large mixing bowl, soak the toasted baguette in milk. Set aside. 4. Make the roux, or the sauce thickener. In a large skillet, heat vegetable oil in medium heat until somewhat smoking. Pour flour and mix with a whisk. Keep mixing for about 15 minutes or until flour is red-orange. If black spots start to appear in the flour, it means you've burnt it. You have to start over. Remove from heat and keep mixing with the whisk to help cool down the roux. When cool, add to the mashed vegetables. 5. Make caramelized sugar. Heat another skillet and cook the sugar with a whisk until it caramelizes. Remove from heat and set aside. 6. Now you have a a large bowl of mashed vegetables with roux. This is your vadas base. Use the leftover water to keep a sauce consistency. Add the sour cream and mix. Add the caramelized sugar. Season with the lemon juice and the mustard until you get a somewhat sweet and sour taste. Set aside. 7. Don't forget the dumplings. By this time, the baguette has absorbed all the milk. Add in the eggs, flour, butter and salt. Mix until you get a soft and sticky batter. 8. Boil some water in a large pot. When boiling, spoon some batter and make a few balls. Drop them in the boiling water and cook for about 5 minutes, or until they come up to the surface. Avoid overcrowding. Using a slotted spoon, remove them to a chopping board. Slice in thick rounds when cool enough to handle. 9. To serve, slice the beef in thick slices. Arrange the beef on a plate with some dumplings. Pour in some sauce on the side. Related post/s: More Cooking the World recipes: Thailand About Cooking the World: Global Gastronomy Food Project

Out of all the recipes I tried to make use of the kampachi batch that Kona Blue Water Farms generously sent me, this was the simplest, but also the most complicated in taste. The coconut cream was wee thick, but the kaffir leaves and the lime juice squirted in the end made the fish lighter. I remembered a cauliflower pilaf to serve with this and a 10-minute prep made an impressionable dish. Ingredients: 2 fillets of kampachi 1/4 cup of coconut cream 1/4 cup dry white wine a knob of ginger, peeled, julienned 1 shallot, thinly sliced 1 clove of garlic, minced a handful of basil leaves, chiffonade a handful of kaffir lime leaves, chiffonade juice from half a lime butter salt, pepper, oil 1. Using a small pan, heat butter and cook shallots and garlic without browning. Add white wine and deglaze. Add the coconut cream and the rest of the ingredients and simmer for a few minutes. Season with salt and pepper. 2. Sprinkle a little bit of salt and pepper on the fillets. In a separate skillet, heat some oil and sear fillets, about 4 minutes per side. Remove to a serving plate and top with coconut cream sauce. Squirt with some lime juice for some kick.

Kona Kampachi Paksiw, Filipino Vinegar Stew

Paksiw, or what I would translate as Filipino vinegar stew, has got to be my father's favorite dish. Filipinos, especially those from the northern part of the country, love anything with vinegar. We can cook and stew almost anything in sour goodness and make an honest meal out of it. My father loves fresh seafood paksiw the best because he grew up in a farm where the family didn't own a refrigerator. He's told me about heading into the nearest town very early in the morning to buy the morning's catch and consuming all of them before they went bad, usually before the day ended. Meat was expensive and hard to come by. The traditional paksiw recipe uses milkfish, or bangus, but Kona Blue Water Farms sent me a whole kampachi and I wanted to use every part of it. It would have been a waste to throw away a perfectly good head. My father happily cleaned and gutted out the fish. I used the entire head for this dish with a small steak from the body. My favorite part is crushing the pepper after the entire thing has reduced: the sourness has a touch of spiciness to it that will make the skin behind your ears crawl. Ingredients: kampachi head with some fillets 1/2 cup white vinegar a small knob of ginger, peeled, crushed 1 green Serrano pepper salt 1. In a nonreactive pot, bring all ingredients to a boil with 1/4 cup of water, uncovered. 2. When boiling, lower the heat and simmer for 10 minutes, covered, turning fish head once to evenly cook. The liquid should have reduced, making the vinegar and water combination more concentrated. If you like, crush the pepper a tad to release some spice into the stew.

I felt bad searing the Kona Kampachi fillets from Kona Blue Water Farms. It was enough that I baked it with butter the first time. I felt blasphemous to be ruining such a good fish with heat. But when seared, Kona Kampachi turns into the Cinderella of fish: an oomph was added to what would have been a very simple flavor. It became richer and meatier, as if the oil plumped it up. The soy-ginger sauce actually took the fish a notch down. A tarty watercress and pear salad with crumbled blue cheese and a glass of dry white wine made our dinner complete. We made it way past midnight. Ingredients: 2 fillets of kampachi a knob of ginger, peeled, julienned 1 shallot, thinly sliced a jigger of soy sauce a splash of sherry oil 1. Make the soy-ginger sauce. Combine all the ingredients, except the fish and oil, in a small bowl and let sit until ready to serve. 2. Using a skillet, heat some oil and then sear one side of the fish for about 3 minutes. Gingerly turn it using a heat-resistant spatula. Sear the other side for another 3 minutes. Transfer to serving plates and spoon soy-ginger sauce on top of the seared fillets.

One of my father's specialties during the holidays is pichi-pichi, a grated cassava dessert cooked in milk and sugar and eaten with fresh coconut. I was delighted to find leftover shredded coconut in the fridge when I was exploring different ways to cook the Kona Kampachi sent to me by Kona Blue Water Farms. Kona Kampachi is known as Almaco Jack in the wild and Hawaiian yellowtail in most kitchens and sushi restaurants. Kona Blue nurtures its Kona Kampachi from hatch to harvest, making it a sustainably-raised fish that has no detectable levels of mercury and is completely free of internal parasites. Kona Kampachi is also good for you-it is rich with healthy Omega-3 fish oils-and the fat content makes it one of the most flavorful fish available in the market today. One of the most interesting recipes from Jean-Georges' cookbook, Asian Flavors of Jean-Georges, involved halibut, but I can't imagine how it could be any better than when I used the kampachi. The fish itself is mildly sweet-you can taste its natural flavor without any of the dressings. To dress it even seemed a waste to me because it's good on its own, sashimi-style. But Kona Blue was extremely generous and I had a lot of fish. I wanted to try different ways of cooking it. Ingredients: kampachi fillets a knob of butter For the salad topping: 1 cup shredded coconut half an apple, thinly sliced a small knob of ginger, peeled, julienned 1 shallot, thinly sliced fresh basil leaves, thoroughly washed, patted dry, chiffonade juice from 1 lemon Thai chili, seeded, chopped a knob of butter salt, pepper, oil 1. Prepare the salad that will go on top of the fish while you preheat the oven 275º. Combine all the salad topping ingredients together in a small bowl. Drizzle with lemon juice and season with salt and pepper. 2. Butter a baking sheet. Lay fillets and bake for 15 minutes. 3. When serving, top the fish with the coconut salad. Drizzle with some leftover lemon juice. Related post/s: Read more about Kona Kampachi and buy from their Web site Get your own copy of Asian Flavors of Jean-Georges

171 1st Avenue between 10th and 11th Streets 212/777-7773 about $58 for two, with one beer, with tip ♥ ♥ Updated: My bad. Momofuku Ko is still under construction in what used to be the original space of Momofuku Noodle Bar. Thanks, Zach. Is there a stronger English word than savory that can describe the taste that is Momofuku? What I'm looking for is the translation for malinamnam, the Tagalog word for something really flavorful and delicious at the same time. What was Momofuku Noodle Bar is now a much larger and brighter space with more items in the menu that do not involve noodles. They needed it too, with all the accolades chef David Chang and his restaurants have been receiving the last couple of years. But that more-than-savory taste is still there. A bowl of grilled baby octopus was tender. Julienned carrots and some seaweed were mixed in and made the dish more interesting. I thought the sesame seeds were a nice touch. They were out of the Brussels sprouts when I visited, so we ordered the Manila clams instead made pretty with slivers of celery. I could have stopped there but every time I'm visiting one of the Momofukus, I can't help but stuff myself. Even at more than $10, the big bowl of pork neck ramen with a beautifully-poached egg is a must-have. And it was as malinamnam as I remembered it from two stores down.

One of my New Year's resolutions is to eat at least one fruit a day, everyday. It's been difficult with the small selection of fresh fruits this winter, so the sale of canned pineapple chunks at my local grocery store caught my eye. I rarely buy anything canned, but three cans of pineapple for $2 seemed like a good deal to me. I thought of making a sweet and sour sauce with the pork picnic, or lower part of the shoulder, I picked up from Chinatown. Slivers of pork belly would be a good substitute, but I opted for the meatier part of the pig here. A melee of colorful vegetables made this the perfect Sunday lunch with family. Ingredients: 1/2 pound of pork picnic, trimmed of fat and excess skin, chopped 1 zucchini, thinly sliced 1 cucumber, julienned a handful of string beans 1 red bell pepper, julienned 1 yellow bell pepper, julienned 1 red onion, thinly slice 2 cloves of garlic, minced a small bunch of chives, chopped a dash of sesame seeds, toasted salt, oil For the sweet and sour sauce: 1 can of pineapple chunks, drained 3 tbsps sugar a jigger of red wine vinegar 1 shallot, thinly sliced 1 clove of garlic, minced 1. In a small pot, combine all the sweet and sour ingredients and simmer for 5 minutes while occasionally stirring to avoid sticking. 2. In a large wok, heat some oil and cook pork pieces until evenly browned. 3. Add green beans and stir-fry for 8 minutes or until tender. Add the rest of the vegetables and stir-fry for 5 minutes. 4. Pour in the sweet and sour sauce and toss. Season with salt to taste. Sprinkle with chives and sesame seeds before serving. Related post/s: Sweet and sour taste with fish Celery granita for dessert

The new year has just begun and I already have a favorite cookbook: Stéphane Reynaud's Pork & Sons from Phaidon. I immediately wanted it when I saw José Reis de Matos' pig illustrations and Carlotta's hand-written curly titles bounded in baby pink and white gingham checks, but I held off from buying yet another cookbook. In Austin's Bookpeople, it was sold at a discounted price; I finally walked away with it. The front page has \"for the love of sausages\" written on it and there are drawings of pigs in hammocks, on bicycles, wading in mud and even pole dancing on the cover of a chapter called \"A Piggy Party\". This book was made for me! If not to make your own sausages or cook this pig's ears salad from page 186, just buy it to squeal-pun intended-at the illustrations. As soon as I saw this recipe, I knew how it was going to taste and feel in my mouth. The pig's ears will be gelatinous and the cartilage crunchy; the ginger and the shallots adding a kick while the spinach tames everything down. I loved the pig's ears appetizer at El Quinto Pino and I could imagine this being served there as well. I would even try this with some flat parsley leaves or spicy arugula if I don't have spinach handy. It's good with a glass of white wine, but even better with cold beer. Ingredients: 3 pig's ears, thoroughly washed half a bunch of baby spinach 2 shallots, thinly sliced 1 small knob of ginger, peeled, julienned a handful of fresh chives, chopped a few jiggers of red wine vinegar salt, oil 1. Cook the pig's ears in boiling water for 1 hour. Drain and let cool. 2. In the meantime, combine the shallots, ginger, chives and some canola oil in a bowl. 3. When the pig's ears are cool enough to handle, slice thinly. 4. Heat some frying oil in a skillet and cook the ears until golden brown, while stirring occasionally using a wooden spoon to scrape off the gelatinous stuff that sticks to the bottom of the pan. Splash with the red wine vinegar and cook for 2 more minutes. 5. Remove to a plate lined with paper towel to drain the oil a little bit, and then transfer to the bowl with the spinach and shallot mixture. Toss and season with salt.

I loved this Mark Bittman recipe from The New York Times. I liked the idea of serving egg as an appetizer, but I loved that each guest was getting his own ramekin on the table even better. But for my first try, sans ramekins in our rental house in Austin, I buttered up a small baking pan to pull this off. I used some random vegetables we had in the fridge. When I served them, I just cut out each cooked egg with a spatula and served them on plates. It was a new take on eggs for our New Year's Eve dinner. Ingredients: 5 eggs 2 tomatoes, sliced 3 asparagus stalks, blanched, chopped 1 cup of white mushrooms, chopped a handful of fresh basil knob of butter salt, pepper 1. Preheat oven to 375º. Coat the inside of five ramekins with butter. Put one tomato slice at the bottom, then top with the vegetables. Two basil leaves per ramekin will do. Break one egg into each ramekin and season with some salt and pepper. 2. Put the ramekins on a baking sheet and bake for 12 minutes or until egg is set. Because the ramekins retains heat, the eggs will continue to cook after you remove them from the oven, so it's best to undercook them slightly.

We went crazy in Central Market when we were in Austin. Every produce aisle should look like theirs. After Cameron pushed the cart to pick up the ingredients she needed for her salads, we bought a $50 rack of lamb. I knew I wanted something savory for our New Year's Eve dinner, so I went to the spice aisle and happily weighed some loose curry powder and bought it for 45 cents. With iPhone on hand, I Googled a chutney to match the Indian flavor. Because we were expecting a couple to join us for dinner to make us five, I wanted to do something low key as well. In fact, I was able to prepare the lamb in between courses; only the chutney was done before our guests came in. Cameron's spinach salad peppered with blueberries, cranberries and almonds and roasted fingerling Peruvian potatoes were nice sides with this. Ingredients: rack of lamb garlic cloves, minced a small knob of ginger, peeled, thinly sliced curry powder salt, pepper, oil For the apricot-lime chutney: 6 fresh apricots, pitted, chopped juice from a lime lime zest honey a small knob of ginger, peeled, thinly sliced 1. Preheat oven to 350º. Make small slits all over the lamb using a sharp knife. Insert garlic and ginger. Cover the rack of lamb with the spices and let sit for half an hour or until ready to cook. 2. Place all chutney ingredients in a saucepan, add water and bring to a boil. Lower heat to simmer and cook for 30 minutes. Stir occasionally. Add a little water if it begins to dry when simmering. Allow to cool before serving. 3. Using an oven-safe frying pan, brown one side of the rack in hot oil. Transfer in the oven and cook for 25 minutes or until medium-rare. Let rest on a wooden block to finish cooking before slicing and serving. Related post/s: Another Indian-inspired dish using fruit chutney Salsa verde recipe good with either beef or lamb

I had a dozen dumplings in the freezer and a cold, so I could only think of making myself a big bowl of hot and spicy soup to combat the sniffles. I was too lazy to go anywhere to buy ingredients. I had to make do with whatever I could rummage in the pantry. Arugula? Check. Baby carrots? Check. Cabbage? Oooh, check. I found a small jar of dashi to make the broth taste like miso, and of course, there is a jar of kochujang paste to make it spicier. Koreans call dumplings mandu. Included in a soup using clear broth, it becomes mandu gook. Most restaurant mandu gooks come with rice cakes, or dduk, and therefore called dduk mandu gook. And that's enough Korean lesson for today. Here's my Filipino version of the soup that helped keep the medicine away. Ingredients: 12 dumplings, thawed if frozen 8 dduk, thawed if frozen a small wedge of cabbage, roughly chopped a handful of baby carrots a handful of arugula 1 shallot, halved 1 tbsp kochujang paste 2 tbsps dashi granules 1 tsp sesame seeds, toasted salt 1. In a stock pot, boil 8 cups of water with the dashi and the shallot. Turn the heat to medium-low when boiling and add the vegetables until the carrots are tender. 2. During the last ten minutes of cooking, add the dduk and the dumplings to soften. Season to taste with salt and kochujang paste. Related post/s: Make your own dumplings Make other soups with dashi

103 West 77th Street off Columbus Avenue 212/362.3800 $70 each for four, with two bottles of wine, with tip ♥ ♥ ♥ A week into its opening, and chef-owner John Fraser, previously of Snack Taverna, already showed his guns. With 'Cesca and Telepan, I am glad that I live close to the upper west side and have access to civilized dining without trekking all the way downtown. I will be completely jealous of the neighborhood residents when the restaurant starts serving its $38 suppers a la Lucques of Los Angeles. Judging from the dishes I had during opening week, I know it will also do well when it opens for brunch this new year. Four of us met at Dovetail to celebrate the end of the year, but one had to run in the rain on her way to the restaurant. Needless to say, she was very unhappy when she couldn't find the faintly lit door on 77th Street. We all felt we had to apologize to the maitre d' for her initial reaction, but the staff instead went out of their way to make it up to her. We immediately started drinking a bottle of Argentinian Malbec while we waited for our orders. An amuse-bouche of caviar and fried capers were served in artsy spoons on top of lentils. Back in my younger days when I volunteered to work in the Bryant Park fashion shows, I had my share of caviar snubbed by the models backstage. Liking caviar is an acquired taste and I'm sorry to say that I still don't have it especially if they're served with capers. Nothing to fret over, of course, because the appetizers started coming in. The pork belly with warm hen's egg was delicious. The savory porcini mushrooms was a nice contrast to the runny yolk. I love, love, love runny eggs with my dishes! I wasn't too keen in ordering the gnocchi since I just had them at Bouley three days before and again at Bacaro a week ago, but my friends really wanted to try the veal short ribs that came with it. With black truffles, prunes and shavings of Pecorino, it was an absolutely indulgent and hearty dish. I could eat this in a bowl on my lap any winter night with a glass of full-bodied red wine. The beef tartare on top of lobster meat was a good combination. Served cold, I thought it was a nice opposite to all the warm plates. I also couldn't have enough of the Brussels sprouts leaves with Serrano ham. It was very simple; dressed so appropriately with cauliflower and pears. Into our second bottle of red, this time a lighter Grenache from Australia, we talked about how everything so far had been very satisfying. We have settled on our warm seats and my lone grouchy friend was no longer. The four of us continued to show our carnivorous sides with the beef sirloin, duck, lamb's meat and tongue. The sirloin was served with beef cheek lasagna and chantarelle mushrooms. I can now get my favorite Babbo dish uptown! The duck, sent complementary by the chef, tasted like really good and juicy beef steak. They disappeared from the plate before I could get a second piece. The lamb, with a nice tabbouleh wrapped in grape leaves, was jazzed up with Indian spices, mint and yogurt. There just shouldn't be any other way to eat lamb but medium-rare. The lamb's tongue was an appetizer, but served with our main courses, it was a bit of an anomaly on the table-I ate on my own after my companions focused their attention on the other meats. The parsley leaves were a good distraction to the powerful offal-olive taste. As for the desserts, Dovetail's pastry chef matched Fraser's performance in the kitchen. The citrus came with a cookie and white chocolate. I've previously declared my love for desserts with a combination of tart and sweet, but my friends preferred the rich butter pudding with rum and bananas. As my first post in 2008, I am very satisfied with Dovetail. I hope this means the rest of 2008 will be even better. Happy eating! Related post/s: 'cesca is in the neighborhood And so is Telepan

Dduk Bok-kee, Korean Beef Sauté with Rice Cake

Koreans usher in the new year eating dduk, or what we non-Koreans refer to as rice cakes. Rice flour is used to make dduk and the end product is dense and sticky, like the Japanese mochi and the Filipino kalamay. I can only assume that Koreans eat dduk during the new year for the same reason Filipinos and Chinese eat noodles: for long lives, and well, \"many children\". There are different kinds of dduk eaten as a snack or as dessert, but what I like are the cylindrical ones used in this hearty recipe. If I encounter this in a Korean restaurant, it's usually sans meat, but having perfected my Korean bibimbap earlier this year, I thought that adding beef in it won't hurt. Instead of a soup, though, I made a sauté with the beef lightly seared. Serve this with Korean store-bought banchan, or side dishes. Ingredients: a handful of Korean dduk 1 small red bell pepper, julienned 1 yellow squash, chopped 1 bunch of scallions, chopped in 1/2-inch pieces 1 tbsp soy sauce 1 tbsp brown sugar 1 tbsp sesame oil 2 tbsps kochujang, or Korean red pepper paste 1 tbsp peanut oil For the beef marinade: 2 slices of lean beef 1 tbsp soy sauce 1 tbsp brown sugar 1 tbsp sesame oil 1 tsp mirin, or rice wine 1 clove of garlic, minced 1. In a small bowl, marinate beef while you prepare the dduk. 2. In a small pot of boiling water, cook the dduk for 5 to 7 minutes. They're done when a fork easily pricks them. Remove from the water using a slotted spoon. Set aside. 3. Heat peanut oil in a sauté pan. Sauté scallions until soft. Add the red bell pepper and the squash and cook until tender. Move the vegetables to the side to make room for the beef. Add the beef and sear for 2 minutes per side. Remove the beef using tongs onto a chopping board. 4. Remove the pan from the heat while you slice the seared beef against the grain. Turn on the heat again and add the beef back, the dduk and the remaining ingredients. Toss until completely combined. Add more kochujang paste if you want your dduk bok-kee spicier. Related post/s: Korean bibimbap recipe Kochujang sauce and sashimi Han Ah Reum has all the Korean ingredients you need

Gyoza, Homemade Dumplings

We were at Sona's apartment earlier this year for a pot luck party to congratulate two friends who ran the marathon and we all contributed to making the gyoza, or dumplings. My Japanese friends make them frequently at home and they were sealing them as fast as I can say \"dumpling\". I was slower and mine came out a little askew, but at least they didn't fall apart when cooking. Americans call them pot stickers because, well, they stick to the bottom of the pot when you fry them. Koreans call them mandu and include them in a soup using clear broth, or mandu gook. You can substitute the pork filling with ground chicken or shrimp, but the rest of the ingredients are non-negotiable if you want to make gyoza, Japanese-style. You can go to YouTube and search for the many how-to-make-dumpling videos available. They key is frying them on one side and cooking them thoroughly by adding a little water to the pan and steaming them. Open up a bottle of Sapporo and you're set for the rest of the afternoon. Ingredients: 1 package of gyoza skins 1/2 pound of ground pork a small wedge of cabbage, roughly chopped 1 bunch of scallions, finely chopped 3 cloves of garlic, minced a knob of ginger, peeled and finely chopped 1 tbsp soy sauce 1 tbsp sesame oil 2 tbsps peanut oil 1. Make the filling by combining all the ingredients except for the skins in a large bowl. 2. To prepare the dumplings, you'll need a small bowl of water to seal the dumplings and a wet paper towel to cover the gyoza skins to keep them from drying out. Using a teaspoon, spoon the filling in the middle of the skin. Dab one edge of the skin with water and fold the skin over in half and pinch in the middle. To seal the sides, ruche and pinch to make pleats. (There goes my fashion education.) 3. Steam-fry the dumplings. Heat up the peanut oil in a deep frying pan. Add the dumplings one side down and fry for 3 minutes. Lower the heat and add 1/4-cup of water. Cover to steam the dumplings for about 8 minutes, or until most of the water has evaporated. Remove using a heat-resistant spatula to a plate lined with paper towel. Dip in soy sauce and vinegar mixture. Related post/s: Buy gyoza skins Just like making your own meatballs

120 West Broadway on Duane Street 212/964.2525 $175 for the tasting menu with wine pairings, without tip ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ There comes a time in your life when you have an awesome meal with good company and you think back the next day without regrets because you realize you deserve everything. Unfortunately for me, I think that way 80% of the time, but I recently read that desire is never a mistake. For my birthday this year, my good friend Miriam and her fiancé, Eric, showed me that you have to allow yourself to want things, even if that means a lot of them. And boy, Bouley was the perfect place for it. The night started off with the scent of apples in the foyer. Ever since I stepped in Bouley a couple of years ago to check out the menu, I have known that smell. It's of the holidays, of cider, and of something warm and cozy inside. The small bar at the receptionist's counter was a different matter. Our table was for 8pm, but it seemed like the entire New York Japanese population was also waiting to be seated. It had been drizzling outside and the coat check lady was flustered with requests from customers who have already eaten and from customers waiting to be relieved of their coats. We started afresh as soon as we were seated in the dining room. The ambiance reminded me of Daniel and Le Bernardin, though it isn't as expansive as Daniel's and the crowd around us was less older than that of Le Bernardin's. The jacquard chairs and the tassels on the lamps belong more in Versailles than the TriBeCa neighborhood this incarnation now stands, but you know to expect that the food will be as polished and refined as any old New York institution. Below is a list of what I ate with their wine pairings: 1. Phyllo-crusted Florida shrimp, Cape Cod baby squid, scuba-dived sea scallop and sweet Maryland crab meat in ocean herbal broth with Pouilly Fumé Domaine Lebrun 2006 Restaurants need to cook shellfish more this way: you don't have to force the meat; they just give. The baby squid was a spoonful of tenderness that softly went \"squish\" in my mouth. 2. Potato-crusted Mediterranean rouget with a mung bean saffron risotto, rose-olive sauce and Parmesan cloud with Viognier, Alban Vineyards, Edna Valley, California 2006 The potato gave the fish texture and the olive sauce gave it a bit of tart that harmoniously fused with the delicate touch of cheese. I could have enjoyed this even without the very yellow risotto. Extra points for calling the cheese a \"cloud\". 3. Organic Pennsylvania rack of lamb baked with rocket salad, fava beans, sage and a purée of zucchini and mint with Crozes-Hermitage, Domaine des Vins de Vienne, Rhone Valley 2005 The best of all the racks I've had this year mainly because I wasn't inebriated by the time this course was served. I thoroughly enjoyed the juiciness of the meat and couldn't have enough. The touch of zucchini-mint was just right. The greens wonderfully matched. Just like the risotto with the rouget, I could have done without the gnocchi. 4. Texas pink grapefruit soup infused with green cardamon, star anise and Tahitian vanilla with Campari sugar and fromage blanc sorbet with Moscato D’Asti, Francesco Coppo 2006 The three of us all had this \"soup\" as a palate cleanser. I could have ended our night here with this flawless dessert. This is the kind of dessert I aim to make someday. 5. Warm passion fruit and blueberry meringue with caramel sauce, huckleberry coulis and Provence lavender ice cream with Muscat de Rivesaltes, Domaine des Schistes 2006 I loved the lavender ice cream, but I thought the meringue was too sweet with the caramel sauce. Talk about decadence, but hey, I am allowed to want things. Happy birthday, me.

7 Spring Street between Elizabeth and Bowery 212/777.0877 about $120 for two, with wine pairings, with tip ♥ The $15,000 Enomatic Enoline 8 machine was in place behind the bar when I visited with a friend, but it wasn't functioning. Tonight's not the night if you were in the mood for a $90 glass of wine, our friendly bartender told us. The expensive toy is an argon gas preservation system which keeps wine fresh after it's uncorked for up to two months-I've only used it to decide which bottles to buy from Union Square Wines. Noble Food and Wine has been quiet even though it opened in mid-September. It first made news with the machine and it made a buzz again when chef Daniel Dorado, previously of Marema, reportedly walked out several weeks later. This hasn't been confirmed yet, but the space looked like it was waiting for a party that refused to start. Maybe because it was six days before Christmas, but we felt a little weird for being the only two people there for dinner time. We sat and drank at the bar instead of the lower-level dining room with Philippe Starck furnitures-our bartender seemed like he needed some company. He was attentive without being too obtrusive. To make up for the Eno, he generously let us share our wine pairings. We started with a half dozen oysters with sparkling wine. The busboy wasn't exactly sure which were the Kumamotos from the Blue Points, but our bartender came back to the rescue and clarified. The perfectly-cooked serving of seared scallops came with a nice glass of white from Oregon and the Berkshire pork chops with honey-glazed apples and sautéed spinach were served with a full-body red. We weren't sure what wines we were drinking anymore, but we both thought that it was just a sign that we were actually having an okay time. When it was time for dessert, we also split the goat cheesecake. Our bartender proved that he was really paying attention to his only two customers of the night because he served it with a lit candle after he overheard that my birthday was coming up. Thankfully, two more couples walked in before we paid our bill. We didn't feel as bad when we left to join the revelry outside. We appreciated our bartender, but I'm afraid Eater.com's Deathwatch is looming over Noble Food and Wine. Related post/s: Tequila and Mexican at Cafe El Portal just around the corner

141 First Avenue between St. Mark's Place and 9th Street 212/529.2740 about $30 each for three, with sake, with tip ♥ What shoyu, or soy sauce, ramen is to Rai Rai Ken is shio to Setagaya. Shio, or salt, ramen is the only type available at Setagaya, so you better like it more than you do your pork bone type, or tonkotsu, or fermented soybean paste, or what we all know as miso. I walked in with two other friends who were craving a hot bowl of soup for dinner and I suggested that we try Setagaya. It was cold outside so the line that snaked around First Avenue when the restaurant first opened is now gone, but the cold air has moved inside with the customers. The glass wall does not help. We sat tucked in the corner by the kitchen bar, but every time someone came in, we felt a chill. We ate our dinner wearing our coats and sharing two small bottles of sake. Setagaya follows the traditional shio broth recipe that includes boiling dried seafood, like anchovies and scallops, for hours at a time. In fact, all that saltiness comes from the ocean. The broth is not clear because it is also flavored with pork that's been barbecued on a charcoal grill. It sounds good, but we all had the same complaint: the broth tastes too much of barbecue. The secret ingredient is reportedly Vietnamese salt, and boy, was it salty. I love shio ramen because it's lighter than the other types, but the charred and salty flavors didn't meld the night we visited. The noodles, though, were perfect in texture and stringiness. I love my ramen noodles a little chewy and meaty, and Setagaya's reminded me of those $5 giant bowls I ate in Tokyo's ramenyas oh so many years ago. Stick with the regular size when you visit, though, because you can only have so much barbecue and salt flavor in your ramen.

What to do with still the remaining homemade corned beef in the fridge? Reuben sandwiches, of course! They were actually the reason why I made my own corned beef in the first place because I've been curious about how they are made ever since I tasted a really good version from Gettin' Hungry, themorning deli on Hudson Street with the giant wooden lion inside. The origin of the Reuben sandwich is still being disputed, but it is essentially a grilled sandwich made with corned beef, Swiss cheese, sauerkraut and Russian dressing on rye bread. I also don't eat a lot of sandwiches besides the Vietnamese kind, but when I make them at home, I like them to be elaborate. But there are two things I don't stock in the kitchen: ketchup and mayonnaise. It was snowing outside, but I made the trip to the grocery store anyway to pick them up. In the same aisle, I discovered horseradish cream sauce from Kraft. It looked like mayonnaise, but I guessed correctly, a touch of dried horseradish was included in the mix. Reuben sandwiches require a Russian dressing that looks like Thousand Island, but I figure, I can get away with this ready-made type especially after already spending five hours making my own corned beef the other day. Combine the following to make Russian dressing if you don't want to use ready-made horseradish cream sauce: 1/3 cup mayonnaise 1 1/2 tbsp ketchup 1 1/2 tsp prepared horseradish 1/2 tsp Worcestershire sauce salt, pepper Ingredients: corned beef, shredded; thinly-sliced if not homemade Swiss cheese slices sauerkraut, excess water squeezed off using paper towels 8 slices rye bread horseradish cream sauce half a stick unsalted butter, softened in microwave for 15 seconds 1. Spread one side of each bread slice evenly with some butter. With buttered sides down, spread horseradish cream on four slices and with some corned beef, sauerkraut and equal portions of cheese. Top with remaining slices, buttered side up. 2. Place large skillet over high heat and melt a small knob of butter. Reduce heat to low and add sandwiches. Using an iron grill press, put on top of the sandwiches and press. Cook until browned and crisp on both sides, about 2 minutes a side. Transfer to a platter lined with parchment paper. Cut in half and serve. Related post/s: Homemade corned beef is so much better Pressed taleggio cheese sandwich Turkey bacon avocado portobello sandwich

136 Division Street between Ludlow and Orchard 212/941.5060 $50 each for five, with two bottles of wine, with tip ♥ I used to know someone who lived on Madison Street in the deep recesses of Chinatown five years ago, but I haven't been back in the area since then. Before that, Good World on Orchard was the place to be among dot-comers. For the last four years, I've been working in and around SoHo and have grown to love Frank DeCarlo and John LaFemina's Peasant on Elizabeth Street. Its downstairs space is one of the places I end up in when I don't have a reservation nor a dinner plan. When Bacaro started appearing in food blogs as DeCarlo's latest project after splitting from LaFemina, I kept a note in my head to make it back to Division Street when I get the chance. That opportunity came a little earlier last week when five of us wanted to eat from small plates and share bottles of wine but had nowhere to go. I had to lend my cab driver my iPhone to show him where Division Street is located because he said he had never heard of it. I was dropped off in the corner of a very quiet and deserted street. If it weren't for the few smoking outside, I would have thought my Google map was wrong. At 7pm, the four in our party were at the bar waiting for a table. We witnessed as other groups were seated as soon as they came in. It became worrisome that once another group showed up, we'd have to leave to find another restaurant, unless we wanted to wait for another hour. The bartender was nice enough to seat just the four of us-he made a smaller group move to a smaller table near the door just to accommodate us-and let us order food and wine while we waited for our fifth. We started with duck prosciutto and some pear slices. Salty and tougher than the prosciutto I'm used to, the pears were still a good match. The braised duck leg that was served when our party was complete fared better, although it was still on the salty side. I assumed the octopus would come in vinaigrette just like they have them in Peasant, but they were fried in batter like calamares, which I'm not a fan of. It was amusing to find lemon peels and yellow bell pepper covered in batter, too, but I just thought the dish didn't belong with the rest of our food. I also thought the meatballs were going to be gigantic like they have them at ápizz, John LaFemina's second venture but without DeCarlo, but they were so small I could have eaten twenty more of them. The polenta salad was the most interesting because it was topped with a small chunk of cod. At Bacaro, everything I thought was a salad did not come with any leaves. The cod whet our appetites and prepared us for the gnocchi cooked in brown butter with mushrooms and the pasta with anchovy sauce-one warm and hearty, the other difficult to split among five.

Homemade Corned Beef with Cabbage and Potatoes

It's feeling a lot like the holidays outside and all I've been drinking, besides wine, is Guinness draft. And what else matches with a full-bodied glass of Guinness? Corned beef, cabbage and potatoes! (Besides oysters, of course.) This recipe involves a lot of planning. In my case, I made sure I went straight home after work on the 10th day so that the brisket wasn't going to sit in brine another day. But once you start cooking, it's really a no-brainer. I set the timer of the stove an hour at a time once I started to slow-cook the brisket to remind me to check. After three hours, the vegetables took another half an hour. If you can't find ready-made pickling spices, you can easily combine the following and make your own: 2 cinnamon sticks, broken 1 tbsp mustard seeds 2 tsps black peppercorns 1 tsp whole cloves 1 tsp whole allspice 1 tsp powder ginger 4 dried bay leaves Ingredients: 1 fresh beef brisket, about 4 pounds 1 small head of cabbage, cut in small wedges 6 medium red potatoes, halved 3 ribs celery, cut in 2-inch pieces 2 cups of baby carrots 2 large onions, cut in wedges 5 cloves garlic, minced 2 tbsps whole grain mustard 3 tablespoons pickling spices 1 1/2 cups kosher salt 1 cup granulated sugar 1. Using a large Dutch oven, make the corned beef brine. Combine about 10 cups of water, salt, sugar, mustard, spices, and 3 cloves minced garlic. Bring to a boil over high heat. Remove from heat and set aside to cool. When cool enough, add the brisket. If necessary, add more cold water to cover the beef. Using a heavy bowl, weigh the brisket down so it will stay submerged in the water. Cover the pan and refrigerate for up to 10 days in the refrigerator. 2. When ready to cook, discard the brine and rinse the brisket well with cold water. Return to the Dutch oven and cover with cold water. Add the celery, onions and the remaining garlic. Bring to a boil and skim off impurities. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover and simmer for 3 hours. 3. Add the potatoes, carrots and cabbage. Continue to cook in medium-low heat until vegetables are tender, about 30 minutes more. 4. To serve, remove corned beef from liquid and slice in small chunks. Add cabbage, potatoes and carrots on the side. Drizzle some of the liquid on top of the corned beef and all over vegetables. Related post/s: Cold weather also reminds me of oxtails and wine

79 MacDougal Street off Houston 212/260.0100 about $45 each for two, with tip ♥ I've been wanting to go to Smith's since it opened, but every time I would remember to walk by, they always give me an estimated hour-long wait. One Monday night, I was able to get a table for two on short notice. The place was full, but when I asked our waitress if we can chill with our drinks first before ordering anything, she told us we can stay as long as we want because it wasn't going to be a busy night. I was so glad to hear that, too, because I was losing faith with restaurant servers due to most recent experiences. Our waitress continued to be attentive and pleasant the entire night. When we finally started to feel hungry, we ordered several small plates to share. I loved the squid, charred with lemon, olives and pancetta bits, and I thought it was a good match with the heavier, more substantial artichoke pasta with black truffles. A steamed egg with Gorgonzola and polenta was a sophisticated dish even though I feel like foams have come and gone. The Portuguese sardines were butterflied and were quite tasty with tomato confit, but oh, is that more foam? I loved how crunchy the fish was but the small bones were cumbersome in my mouth. One even pricked my gums and I had to excuse myself and go to the bathroom to pull it out. Either we were getting more drunk as we sampled dish after dish, or that our choice of sparkling wine really matched everything we ordered. Even the roasted beets became more interesting-I love beets, don't get me wrong-but with creamy horseradish and a nutty flavor, it was a nice complement to the corzetti pasta and earthy mushrooms. I loved Smith's for its location and coziness more than the food itself, but that strip off Houston is so unexciting otherwise I'd definitely come back to make sure it gets a share of my business.

143 Grand Street off Lafayette 212/431.7999 about $45 for two, with tip ♥ Update, 2008: Michael Bao has left Bun I can only imagine how hard it is to work as a waiter/waitress in a city teeming with restaurants, but for everybody's sanity, find another job if you can't even put up with a simple request from one of your customers. I eat out a lot and I'd like to think that I know what I want when I'm ready to eat. There are things I expect when I pay for my food and one of them is some kind of service from the restaurant's staff. Now, I'm not talking about waiting on me hand and foot; I just want the menu as soon as I sit down, the food I've ordered after a reasonable wait, and my bill, preferably with the correct total, after you've cleared the last plate from my table. I could even understand if you don't know an ingredient off the menu (the cute waiter at E.U. during its opening week who told us periwinkles are cured meat) or if you've forgotten today's specials (the waitress who touted the lamb shoulder as chops), as long as you don't act like an asshole afterwards and try to make me the bad person because of your mistake. We went to Bun, Michael Bao's new restaurant on Grand Street, to show our support for a new Asian restaurant opening in the midst of multi-million glass condo buildings coming up in SoHo. It wasn't a particularly busy lunch hour and we were able to score the table near the door as soon as we walked in. My friend and I were the only Asian-looking customers inside. We couldn't but help notice the lacquered red stools at the bar and the canvas Asian prints on the wall. The prices on the menu are obviously set to pay for the restaurant's decor: $6 for a summer roll, $9 for a bowl of pho, $12 for a hot pot. To start, my friend ordered one salmon roll served with anchovy sauce. The sauce reminded me of the Filipino bagoong from the north. The roll is simply a Vietnamese summer roll, only with salmon was used instead of shrimps. Berkshire pork is touted several times on the menu, so I opted for the vermicelli noodles, the restaurant's namesake, with a few slices of them tossed with shrimps. We both ordered the pho for our main course, even though we knew our lunch tab was already running up to $40 without drinks. The chicken pho was bland and we were surprised that it was peppered with pieces of chicken skin, complete with the small goose bumps. It's just like eating at home, said my Chinese friend, but we wondered how the non-Asians in the restaurant felt upon seeing them in their soup. They do not taste bad, of course, but I know people who would be put off with boiled chicken skin in their dish, if not for the looks of it, the jiggly fat underneath. My bun was the day's saving grace. I can't make sure that the pork was indeed Berkshire pork since it's not as distinctively sweet as a Niman Ranch pork, but the sweet and sour sauce had just the right Vietnamese flavor. At Xe Lua in Chinatown, I always order the beef bun when I'm not craving their pho. It was only after the bun came that I realized I've ordered too much food. I got our waiter's attention to ask him to cancel my beef pho. The order was already put in, but I've made a mistake, and I know it wouldn't be too hard to accommodate my request. Instead of going back to the kitchen, our waiter tried to convince me that I should take the pho to go. He only stopped insisting when I told him that I'm not going to eat reheated pho back in the office. When our bill came, the $9 for my canceled pho was still there. I tried to get our waiter's attention again, but he kept looking away whenever he saw me looking. Fed up of waiting, I walked up to the bar, assumed the only guy behind it without chef's white was the manager, and asked him to please take off the $9 off my bill because I've canceled that order earlier. When I returned to our table with the correct bill and we were getting ready to leave a tip, our waiter finally made an appearance and told us, I don't have control over the computer to change your order or the bill. I nicely reminded him that I, too, don't have that access and that was why I expected him to do his job. We still left a 20% tip because we didn't want the other waiters at Bun to think their own efforts are not appreciated. But I hope the restaurant owners realize that only one ugly feather can make an entire plume look bad.

I remember the day like it was yesterday. I was waiting for my coffee inside Starbucks on Crosby and I noticed this man next to me. He looked very familiar. I didn't realize I was staring at him. I looked away and left with my coffee. I knew he was a chef, but my mind was drawing a blank. A few minutes later, while in the middle of starting my morning, his name came to me: Jean-Georges Vongerichten. I was staring at Jean-Georges! In Starbucks! That was almost five years ago. I was reminded of that day when the new Jean-Georges cookbook arrived in the mail last week. Like with any new cookbooks, I saved some quiet time at home to leaf through the pages and look at the beautiful photographs of food. After perusing, I started over, this time armed with small Post-Its to mark the dishes that I would like to make someday. Asian Flavors of Jean-Georges is a culmination of what the chef learned from the year he was sent to Bangkok to be the chef de cuisine at Louis Outhier's restaurant in the Oriental Hotel to his own kitchen adventures in opening Vong, 66 and Spice Market in New York City. I've never been to Bangkok, but some of the recipes easily reminded me of summers in the Philippines with plenty of sweet and sour flavors in our food. There were green mangoes dipped in fish sauce and shrimp paste; grilled fish drizzled with ginger and chiles; pieces of deep-fried pork belly tossed in vinegar and shallots. I could go on, but my mouth is already watering with the memories of enjoying a meal while wiping the sweat off our brows. It's the taste that David Chang and his Momofuku empire have been presenting the last year to the many New Yorkers who are now asking themselves, how come I've never tasted this flavor before? It's always been around: in Chinatown and in Flushing, and at Vong back in 1997. It may have just taken a funky Japanese name for people to realize that they've been eating and tasting the same flavor all along. One recipe that stood out was Jean-Georges' \"Barbecued\" Red Snapper, Thai Style on page 128. I wanted to eat fish after a quick trip to Asia Food Market on Mulberry. I bought the fresh herbs I needed and my pantry is already stocked with the usual Asian condiments, so this recipe was easy to re-create. All I really needed was fish fillets from the market. The original recipe suggests using a food processor to make the cilantro mixture and the tomato salsa. I didn't because I like chunks in my food-the texture actually made this dish less intimidating and look more homemade. Ingredients: 3 red snapper fillets 1 bunch of cilantro, thoroughly washed 1 small can of crushed tomatoes 1 tbsp brown sugar 1 shallot, chopped 4 garlic cloves, minced Thai fish sauce, or nam pla fresh lime juice 1 tbsp sherry vinegar 1 stalk of scallion, chopped 1 fresh Thai chile, seeded, chopped grape seed oil 1. Prepare a bowl with water and ice cubes. Boil some water in a pot, then add cilantro. After less than a minute, drain and transfer to the ice bath. Squeeze water off the cilantro with your hands and roughly chop. In a bowl, toss cilantro with half of the garlic and a jigger of fish sauce. 2. Stuff fish fillets with cilantro mixture by making small slits in the fish using a sharp knife. Put on a plate, cover and keep in the fridge until ready to cook. 3. In another large bowl, make tomato salsa. Combine tomatoes, sugar, shallots, lime juice, vinegar and a couple more jiggers of the fish sauce with the remaining garlic. Add more fish sauce to adjust taste. It should be sweet and sour with just the right amount of saltiness. Set aside. 4. When ready to cook the fish, heat some oil in a large skillet. Fry the cilantro-stuffed fillets on one side for about 4 minutes. Using a heat-resistant spatula, gently flip and cook the other side for another 4 minutes. Remove to a serving plate. Serve with tomato salsa and sprinkle with scallions and chile. Related post/s: Get your own copy of Asian Flavors of Jean-Georges Marinated cucumber with orange zest is a good match

I've changed the name of this dish from Jean-Georges' original recipe, Cucumber Marinated with Orange Peel, because I only used the orange zest to sprinkle on the dish before serving. What I kept was the marinating juice, Chinese-style. This was a great appetizer to another Jean-Georges recipe using fish. Ingredients: 1 cucumber, peeled, cut into strips 1 tbsp sugar 3 tbsp rice vinegar 1 tsp sesame oil 1 fresh Thai chile orange zest 2 tbsp salt 1. In a bowl, toss cucumber, salt and sugar, and let stand for 20 minutes. 2. Toss in the vinegar, sesame oil and rice vinegar, and marinate for another 30 minutes. 3. Sprinkle with orange zest before serving. Related post/s: Get your own copy of Asian Flavors of Jean-Georges This was a great match with fish, Jean-Georges style

Who's in the kitchen? I asked the bartenders in La Lancha restaurant after only my second meal during my trip to Guatemala. Ezekiel, they said. He's been the chef here at La Lancha. I wanted Ezekiel to know that I liked what he had been serving the past two days. While traveling Central America, I've had the same fried fish, roasted chicken, rice and plantains in every country. There's nothing wrong with an honest meal, of course, but it was refreshing to eat something traditional that was executed so well. I was checked-in a resort, but the food did not taste like something for a corporate meeting and the menu certainly did not come with the word \"fusion\" in it. I've had Ezekiel's rolled-up tortilla with ground pork and beef and smothered with tomato salsa. I've had his chiles rellenos, or stuffed peppers; his fish fillet with coriander sauce was equally tasty and flavorful. It was during the third night that I ordered what Guatemalans call subanik, also known as \"God's meal\" in the La Lancha menu, simply because it is a bowl of everything. It was the perfect bowl of hot reddish-orange broth, made better with the rice I mixed in. I couldn't help but order it again for my last night's dinner. When I checked out of my room the next morning, the man himself, Ezekiel, stepped out of the kitchen with the recipe written on a piece of paper. I translated his notes out loud to make sure I understood and he showed me how the peppers that are crucial to the subanik broth look like. He showed me a large dried black pepper and a skinnier one that was dark red. They looked familiar to me because I have seen them in the Spanish aisle of my neighborhood supermarket. I couldn't wait to buy them and try the recipe at home. Back in New York, I found and bought guaque and ancho chiles in $1.50 packets. Guaque chiles are larger than jalapeños but have the same level of spiciness. Poblano chiles are slightly spicier than bell peppers and become the more familiar ancho, or wide, when dried because of its new shape. I had some leftover dried pimento peppers in the cupboard, so I decided that adding a third variety can't hurt. They key to subanik broth is to simmer the chiles with tomatoes and tomatillos, those green tomatoes that come with an onion-paper skin. Toasted sesame and pumpkin seeds only add to the smoky flavor of the soup. Feel free to add almost anything to your version. For my first, I used chicken and leftover turkey meat and skipped the vegetables. For my second, I skipped the meats entirely and just added the vegetables towards the end. I've tried both kaffir and mint leaves and found either worked well, as long as you have fresh lime juice to serve. Ingredients: 2 dried ancho chiles 2 dried guaque chiles 2 dried pimento peppers 4 tomatillos 5 red tomatoes 1 tbsp sesame seeds, toasted 1 tbsp pumpkin seeds, toasted 1 zucchini, chopped 1 carrot, chopped 2 stalks of celery, chopped 2 pieces of chicken breast, sliced in small chunks 1 cup of stewing beef chunks 1 cup rice fresh lime juice half a bunch of cilantro leaves mint leaves salt 1. In a large Dutch oven, boil 10 cups of water with the chiles and the tomatoes. When the water boils, turn the heat down to a medium simmer. Add the cilantro, mint leaves, sesame and pumpkin seeds and cook for about an hour, uncovered. The tomatoes will swell and eventually soften. Gently smash them with the back of a spatula. The broth will be almost black when it's ready. 2. Using a slotted spoon, scoop the chiles and tomatoes into a food processor and purée. Strain the remaining broth to another container to remove the chile seeds. Return the strained broth and the purée to the Dutch oven and continue to simmer. 3. Add the rice to the tomato-chile broth. Stir occasionally to cook the rice. After about 10 minutes, add the carrots, celery and chicken. When the vegetables are halfway done, add the beef and the zucchini. Cook until zucchini is tender. Ladle into bowls and serve with a squirt of lime juice and a sprinkle of sesame seeds. Related post/s: Another travel-inspired recipe using dried pimento peppers Guatemala travel stories

Jesus Antonio told me to look down and walk slowly right behind him. We were on Central Acropolis in Tikal and my guide was getting ready to show me his biggest surprise yet. Now, look up. I raised my head and was immediately in awe. We've been walking through Tikal National Park and we've seen Complex Q and Group G. I was already impressed, but nothing prepared me to the sight of the Great Plaza from the top of Central Acropolis. Temple 1, also known as the Temple of Ah Cacao or Temple of the Great Jaguar, was on my right, Temple 2, or the Moon Temple, on my left. Right in front of me were structures I've only seen in books and magazines. Antonio showed us a dated postcard of Temple 1 to show how it looked before most of the excavations began-how amazing would it have been to follow the reports about a few protruding bricks, and then digging and discovering that they were at least 60 meters deep (that's 200 feet up if you work from the bottom) and as old as the 4th century. And imagine that only a fraction have been excavated after decades of archaeological work! Everything was covered by brush and trees then, except for the tops of the towers because vertical structures did not support the local plant growth. Tikal is so different from Mexico's Teotihuacan, where there is no tree in sight to shade you from the sun. From Tikal's Temple 4 and Temple 5, we sat on the platforms and saw the tops of the other buildings, as if floating among green clouds. I climbed around Temple 1 and 2 to take photos of well-preserved stairs and view the excavated masks. The entire site had been estimated at 23 square miles. Now a UNESCO World Heritage Site, this largest of the ancient ruined cities of the Mayan civilization protected 100,000 to 200,000 people. It gave me goose bumps when I was there, and it's giving me goose bumps as I write this now. The Lost World, Mundo Perdido, was equally stunning, with its three-stairway pyramid now off-limits to traffic. We saw coatimundis roaming around digging for food as we walked through the causeway in the forest. Howler and spider monkeys played with each other on tops of tall trees. A couple of toucan birds sat above us as we ate a La Lancha-prepared lunch of chicken sandwich, fruits and chips and salsa outside the visitors' center with a cold bottle of Gallo beer I requested before we left the hotel. I remembered that it's Thanksgiving Day back in New York City. I know I have so much to thank for-being at Tikal, being in Guatemala, being able to travel on my own.

Killing Me Softly in Cerro Cahui, Guatemala

The knock was soft, but it woke me up. I pulled the curtains away from the door and peeked my head out, Gracias por la llamada.Thanks for the wake-up call. I started to walk away but the guy started to talk in halting English, Es eight o'clock. I turned to him and ask for the time again just to make sure I heard correctly. Es eight o'clock. Ah, shit, fucking howler monkeys woke me up in the middle of the night; I guess I passed out after that. I am not quite sure of the time difference, but frankly, I haven't cared much the last two days. All I know is that I missed the tour to Tikal, which left, well, at eight o'clock this morning. I quickly got ready to talk to front desk and see how I missed the morning tour, but I slowed down when I realized I've had three glasses of wine on my porch while typing yesterday's entry, and another one during dinner. Oh, okay. I was still groggy from the wake-up call that I turned down breakfast and just chose to have a cup of coffee. Evelyn showed me the tour book to let me pick my activity for the day. I remembered that my stay included free use of their mountain bikes, so I opted for that and went for a ride to Cerro Cahui alone. A very long ride. It wasn't even 9am when I left, but I was already drenched in sweat after the second hill. Before I reached the closest village, the road was unpaved and I realized that a stone-covered road gets very taxing after, oh, 15 minutes. I said my holas to cars which didn't slow down upon spotting me on my bike and to children walking with logs of trees on their shoulders. One of the kids I biked past did the construction-worker whistle. Nice, I thought, start them off early. I spotted an old man with almost no teeth on the side of the road with a machete, clearing the tall brush, and I stopped to ask where the hell Cerro Cahui was. Señor, donde esta entrar para Cerro Cahui? because I've seen the bienvenidos sign a few pedals back but not any gates. He rambled an answer in fast Spanish. I nodded as I tried to decipher what he said. All I understood was four kilometers and two doors. Fuck, isn't four kilometers, like, three more miles? Whatever it was, I knew I had a long way to go. I pedaled on. I finally arrived at the pearly gates-well, more like rusting metal-and was very thankful. The security guard helped me with my bike up the steps and I paid my 20 quetzales to enter. He showed me the snakes preserved in glass jars which made me look down at my pants and hike my socks up. Great, serpientos in the fucking trail. He showed me the map, explained that there are two trails: one will take an hour and a half, and the other, three hours round-trip, and asked me which one I would do. Yo no se, I said, because after that bike ride, I seriously was not in the mood to walk more than six miles to the lookout points. So I walked. And I walked. The trail is clearly marked and surrounded by old tree roots. It rained yesterday, so the path was a little damp and slippery. After catching my breath, I felt very calm and relaxed. I had the forest all to myself except for the ubiquitous howler monkeys. Birds, squirrels and a possum-looking orange thing moved around me. I wasn't alone, but felt like I could scream and no one would hear me. I was short of breath again after a few steep climbs and I stopped at some rock to sit and rest. I only brought a small bottle of water with me and have drank most of it during my bike ride. I realized I could pass out right there and no one would know! My knees were hurting but I kept on. When I reached the end of the short hike, I debated with myself if I should keep hiking to reach the mirador because I was so tired. I did anyway, thinking in that Cia proud way, I'm here already, so why not? The view of the lake from the lookout was beautiful. The sky was open and I could see soft ripples on the lake from the light breeze. I continued on to the second lookout point, and after I reached that, I just felt there was no reason to stop hiking the long way. (Well, except not having a drop of water to drink but, you know.) I felt a little woozy and I stopped several times before I gathered enough energy to continue. After what seemed like another hour, I was back where I started. The guard smiled at me and said, Dos horas y media. Muy bien. Two and a half hours, but where's my reward? There was no drinking water. I spotted a faucet near the toilets, but I didn't dare drink it without making sure it was purified. If there is one thing worse than being dehydrated, I think it would be sick to my stomach because of unsafe drinking water. I rested on the steps and watched two guys pay the fee and enter the park. Boys, I hope you have drinking water, I thought, but I realized the car outside was theirs-at least they didn't have to bike to get there. Their driver saw me looking, stepped out of the car and walked to sit next to me. He introduced himself as Alberto, made small talk and offered to drive me to the nearest restaurant after he heard my stomach growl. I politely told him, Necessito volver en La Lancha to say no, and I said what I needed was water. He motioned for me to come with him, took my empty bottle and filled it with his water from the trunk of his car. Drinking water! I thanked him, short of giving him a hug, and I picked up my bike to go. What transpired next was a very difficult hour. When I left, the guard told me that it was 15 minutes to one. When I returned to La Lancha with jelly legs, it was two. I fell to a chair, unlaced my boots and steadied my hands. Carlos was serving a family that just arrived, so I had to wait before I got some ice water. He served me cold lime juice because he knew I was tired. Not only did I look it, he told me that he knew I left at 9am and I was out the entire time. I ate my lunch of chile rellenos, roasted peppers stuffed with ground meat, hungrily. Needless to say, I spent the rest of the afternoon by the pool reading. I took a break only to order coffee upstairs so that I don't fall asleep. Dinner last night was a civilized salad of lettuce and cucumbers, with fish caught from the lake drizzled with coriander sauce. Tonight, I will order the steak. If I'm going to Tikal tomorrow, I will need all the protein I can get. Related post/s: Cerro Cahui, Guatemala photos on Flickr Me, Myself, and I in La Lancha, Peten, Guatemala

The sound started off as a deep howl. I knew it was coming from the howler monkeys because I've heard the same haunting sound before in other parts of Central America and in the jungles of Palawan in the Philippines. I've even had to dodge shit thrown by a family of them in Nicaragua! It was the Darth Vader-like hiss that made me go outside my room to get closer to the source. If you don't know what it's like, imagine standing next to a jumbo jet taking off without wearing any headphones. As far as I can tell, it was only early afternoon-I swore off checking the time the moment I checked-in-so I was mesmerized by how long the monkeys made their noise. I realized I've never heard them this loud and this close before. I look around me and I see an inviting hammock. If I look past the trees, I can see a lake, the Lake Peten Itza of Guatemala. I've just checked in La Lancha, one of Francis Ford Coppola's three resorts in Central America. Alone. I've planned four nights here, including Thanksgiving, to spend time by myself, collect my thoughts and just be at peace. I'll try not to play too much Cat Power-there is an iPod speaker in my room; how brilliant!-and enjoy my time alone with the bottle of Crianza I brought with me. My flight landed at 7:30am local time after a quick connection from Guatemala City to Flores. Funnily enough, I didn't go through Customs before I made my connection. With this trip, I am completing Central America, but I won't have that stamp on my passport. But I also swore off worrying about trivial things as soon as I got on a cab to the airport. I did get a little nervous when the security dogs were placed on the conveyor belt to sniff all the luggages that came through, but as soon as my backpack cleared, I waved at Henry, the La Lancha driver who was holding a piece of paper with my name on it. I was on my way to my small bit of paradise. We drove the 45-minute journey to the resort. I was groggy from lack of comfortable sleep on the plane. Looking out the mini-van window, my first reaction was: how green! My surroundings was so lush. Past the tall trees, a thin sheet of fog covered the hills. When we finally reached the first town, I had my first glimpse of the lake. We continued to drive along its side, on rocky road, until we reached La Lancha. The staff knew I was going to be alone and it showed. Ernesto welcomed me as \"Miss Cia\"-I got used to it easily-and showed me my room. You've come to the right place, Miss Cia, if you wanted to relax, reminding me of my first email request to book a cottage a couple of weeks ago. My room smells of fragrant soap, and the slow movement of the ceiling fan seems to dance with how I am feeling: it's quiet, and inside, I feel completely relaxed, even subdued. From outside my cottage, steep steps lead down to the lake. As soon as I changed to an outfit more appropriate for the 80-degree weather, I walked down until I reached the water. The lounge chairs were wet because it had been raining on and off for the past few days. There was a smaller chair that was dry, so I used that to drift in and out of sleep the rest of the afternoon. When I woke up and started to feel the pangs of hunger, I walked back up to my cottage and to the restaurant. Carlos served me a bowl of hot carrot soup and homemade tortillas with spicy longaniza. Both filled me quickly, but I had watermelon juice with rum to push everything down. I spent the rest of the afternoon reading by the pool and then napping on the hammock. It's raining now and it's quite peaceful to hear water pelt on leaves; an occasional lizard tsk-tsks to remind me that I'm far away from any concrete at this moment. I am that type of person who reads a travel-related article, looks it up online and bookmarks the results for just-in-cases. When I was planning my getaway, I looked through numerous Web sites I've saved to help me decide where to go. I was going alone, and I figured, I should at least check one thing off my list while I'm at it. With this trip, I consider Central America completely crossed off that list, and oh, \"travel alone\" accomplished, too. Related post/s: La Lancha Resort photos on Flickr

Christmas in Caibarien and Remedios, Cuba (2003 Archives)

In Caibarien, our room at Señora Virginia's casa is occupied. She arranged for us to stay at her friend Señor Eladio's house until the lone Italian tenant leaves Christmas day. Señora Virginia's husband, Señor Osmany, reminded us that we should consider eating inside the casas for the rest of our stay in Caibarien because the holidays are the only time the town is mobbed by tourists. Eating home-cooked meals in Caibarien was an easy request for us to fulfill: the town doesn't have much to show for except for horse carriages. We asked Señor Eladio for chicken for dinner because it was the simplest meal to prepare. But when it was time to eat, we were also served pork and shrimps. He told us that it is tradition to eat a feast on Christmas Eve. We are grateful each time we are shown hospitality and abundance at meal times. Remedios, the next town over, is famous for its parrandas, festivals that go all night and into the dawn. We arranged for a cab to drive us there to witness the two sections of the town \"compete\" for the honor of having the best light show. The two districts, Carmen and San Salvador, prepare long in advance, and in secret, build tall towers of lights and fireworks with a different theme each year. Tonight we saw Indonesian gods and Egyptian-style temples erected on giant static floats situated in each corner of the town plaza. We bought a couple of beers inside the El Louvre bar and people watch in the main square. We even bought a \"champagne\" bottle for US$2.40 to celebrate! We read that the event originated when a local priest told the children to wake the residents up for midnight mass by making noise. It soon became a tradition. We sat in on the mass, which continued even though the noise from the festivities outside and of people milling about inside made it impossible to hear any part of the service. Imagine trying to listen to the priest while the person next to you has his video camera on recording every detail of the light show outside. Imagine trying to hear the prayers while vendors continued to walk around selling souvenirs. We decided to leave in the middle of the sermon as soon as churchgoers started running out to witness the fireworks show, all while the priest was delivering his homily. We stepped out to find several men relieving themselves on the church walls from all the beer they have been drinking since the afternoon. Our driver was waiting for us. He drove us home while he listened to us, amused as we describe the whole party as loco, crazy. It's officially December 25th and I'm a year older, but it's also time to sleep so that we can wake up in a couple of hours and celebrate Christmas on the beach. We awake to the jingle that I will most often repeat and use to annoy the boy throughout the rest of the trip: Calieeente! El paaan! The bread man was doing his early rounds and he was loudly selling his hot bread just like the balut men of the Philippines. I drink my coffee on the balcony and watch the cookie man pass by with his Styrofoam box full of freshly-baked cookies (Koooki! Koooki! Koooki!). The ice man unloaded his melting goods from his horse carriage (Hielo! Hielo! Hielo!). We say good-bye to Señor Eladio and move back to Señora Virginia's a few blocks away. We settle in and unpack our belongings. For the first time since our Belize trip a few months ago, I pack a day bag containing our bathing suits, beach blankets and towels. I prepare our reading books and my compact Scrabble, ready to spend six hours on the beach. Related post/s: Remedios and Caibarien, Cuba photos on Flickr Visiting Che's monument in Santa Clara, Cuba

It's only our third day in Cuba and we've already made plans to get out of Havana. We visited the primary school across from Aleida's house to give the principal a few boxes of pencils, Crayons and coloring pens for the children. They were thankful, uttering Qué bueno as we told them about our impressions of the county. Vicente drove us to the Viazul bus station where we had reservations to Santa Clara in the province of Villa Clara, the home of Che's monument. We pulled into the Santa Clara bus station before 8pm where an older gentleman from our casa particular greeted us. A cab ride later, his family, Señora Consuelo and their daughter welcomed us into their home with a couple cold beers. Their place is booked but they've already talked to another Señora about us staying for the night. This is the case with most of our casas in Cuba-reservations would be given up if other guests arrived first. But our hosts would also go out of their way to make sure that a Plan B was available. We walked to Señora Berta's house and unpacked for the night. We did however eat dinner back at Señora Consuelo's house because they had lobsters. As dinner was being prepared we talked to a French couple and drank our Cuba libres, rum and cola. Our lobster and chicken dinner was excellent, an unexpected feast. The next morning, the town center was buzzing with Cubans going about their own business. We decided to walk to the Plaza de la Revolución Ernesto Guevara where a huge bronze statue of Che stands next to an inscription of a letter he wrote to Fidel Castro when he left Cuba. The plaza has enough spotlights to light a stadium and commemorative events still take place here on a regular basis. The plaza is immaculately manicured with a group of men gardening the lawns and more than five guarding the monument and Che's mausoleum below where Che is interred together with thirty-eight of his comrades. The memorial is very tranquil and is indeed a room for contemplation and silence; no cameras are allowed inside. Santa Clara is also the site of the last battle of the Cuban revolution before Castro entered Havana. Batista sent a train full of military weapons to the other side of the country but on the way to Santa Clara, Che and his troops ambushed the train. It is said that this is the beginning of the triumph of the Revolution. The Monumento a la Toma del Tren Blindado is now also a tourist attraction where four of the train cars and a bulldozer that was used to derail the train are preserved. Our stay in Santa Clara was brief because it's Christmas Eve and we have to go to the next town to celebrate. Señora Consuelo arranged for a cab to take us to the next town over, in Caibarien, where we will stay for the next three days. Our driver is keen on pointing out sugar cane factories, universities and tobacco fields as we drive past. Our cab was built in 1957, of French make. Even in its worn condition, we arrived in Caibarien an hour later. Related post/s: Santa Clara, Cuba photos on Flickr Mogotes in Pinar del Rio, Cuba

We felt like we've had enough of Havana. So the next morning we woke up to our second omelette with sausages while Señor Paolo waited for us to finish eating. There's bread and butter on the table. But there is no milk like yesterday. We didn't ask and drank our coffee blacker than the sky last night. We arranged for Paolo to drive us out to the province of Pinar del Rio, west of Havana, to the small town of Viñales in the valley of Sierra de los Organos. It's a three-hour drive, but Paolo kept us company by telling us about his life and about Cuban life in general. During the drive, we witness a lot of Cubans waiting for rides. If our car had not been privately hired, it most likely would have been flagged down as Cubans are sometimes required to pick up other Cubans. Uniformed policemen stop big trucks, herd groups of passengers into the back, and keep the country moving. There were constant reminders of the Revolución and of the country's most admired men. The highway is almost empty and our drive is smooth. We could have swerved from lane to lane if we wanted to! As in so much of rural Cuba, there are chickens, pigs, goats, horses and cows everywhere. The drive to Viñales is pleasant because we are finally out of the city and into more lush surroundings. Mogotes, limestone mountains formed during the Jurassic period, rise from fertile red-soil valleys. We pass farmers cultivating tobacco and vegetables while vultures circle overhead. In the town center, we find Las Brisas, a small restaurant with no other amenities aside from a few chairs and tables. We order pollo frito, fried chicken, with rice and a salad. But today, there is no lettuce. So we are served sliced green tomatoes on the side. We eat with Paolo as he flirts with our waitress. They banter with an easy sort of intimacy that you'd think it's how all conversations between strangers are carried. We finish our Cristals and head out. After lunch we drive to the Mural de la Prehistoria painted under the direction of Lovigildo Gonzalez, a disciple of Diego Rivera. It depicts the story of evolution on the island. If you don't read about the process of how it was painted stone by stone, you can't help but think that it looks like a rock face that has been slapped with graffiti. We visited two caves as well. Inside Cueva del Indio we drifted on a subterranean river and looked up at stalactite formations. At the other end of Cueva de San Miguel we came upon El Palenque de los Cimarrones, a hokey re-creation of a hideout used by cimarrones or runaway slaves. Both venues were touristy and somewhat cheesy. Before sunset, we arrived at Soroa, another small town in the Pinar del Rio province, known mostly known for its spas and a visitor's center. We got the chance to hike to some nearby waterfalls before closing time. The Orquideario or Orchid Gardens was already closed as was El Mirador, the most accessible point for views of the surrounding landscape. Our drive back to Havana was uneventful except for the sight of young men selling blocks of cheese and guava jelly by the side of the highway. We ask Paolo to stop so that we can sample some of their goods. Lacking knife or a fork, we ended up buying the whole block for about P13. I asked Paolo why they were selling it on the side of the road. Clandestino, he says. Clandestine, a catchy word that sticks with us for the duration of our travels in Cuba. We would have something in common with the Cubans after all. Back in Havana and we're looking for something to eat. We ask a gas station attendant if he knows of a place where we can eat a real meal. At El Hueco down the road we have bistek Creolan and Uruguayan styles. We congratulate ourselves for getting a recommendation from a Cuban instead of settling for the sketchy-looking Yang-Tse \"Chinese\" restaurant down the block.

A Museum in Itself: Havana, Cuba (2003 Archives)

We step out of our casa particular in Vedado, a suburb of Havana, and immediately see what will become the familiar silhouette of Ernesto Che Gueverra. As expected, there are frequent reminders of Cuba's history wherever you turn-inspirational quotes from Cuba's national hero, José Martí, and dates of historical importance that most, if not all, Cubans know by heart: July 26, El Triunfo de la Revolución, the Triumph of the Revolution; October 10, the War of Independence; January 1, Liberation Day. We arrived last night from a direct four-hour flight from Montréal. We showed our passports to the customs agent, answered a few questions and made sure that only our tourists cards were stamped. Baggage claim was an agonizingly slow process. But once we exited the terminal we were welcomed by Joél and his father, Paolo. For US$25 they drive us to Señora Aleida's house in Vedado where we will be staying for the next three nights. Tourism flourishes in Cuba despite the embargo imposed by the United States in the 1950s. Luxury hotels cater to well-heeled Canadians and Europeans willing to pay up to US$500 a night for a room. Our travel ethic has always been to get closer to the local people and their culture, so we opted to stay in casas particulares, private homes with rooms for rent, throughout our travels in the country. Señora Aleida and I have been communicating via e-mail for three months prior to our arrival, finalizing our itinerary and booking other casas to stay in once outside of Havana. I told her we wanted to go to a beach. She arranged for us to visit four. Havana looks exactly how we've seen it in magazines and in photographs: it's a museum in itself. Old Cadillacs and Pontiacs cruise the roads. Pre-revolutionary mansions have a faded grandeur suggestive of more materially prosperous times. They are now badly in need of paint jobs and general upkeep. Almost everything is touched with a bit of disrepair. But some things, like the old model cars whose engines have been replaced, are ingeniously and almost lovingly maintained. The newer cars we see on the street are from Europe and Korea. There are no fast food chains except for one that's appropriately named El Rapido and Ditú, a chicken joint. Cubans apparently do not hang out in coffee shops. But we see people waiting by their stoops, their balconies or by their windows. There are lines for pizza folded like tacos, lines to buy helado or ice cream, lines to enter stores and lines to either board a bus or catch a ride with a taxi particular. There is a lot of waiting in Cuba, and we imagine, expectation as well. Our first full day in Havana and Vicente, who lives downstairs, is waiting outside to drive us around for US$20. We've followed the advice of others who have come before us and have brought the basics with us-things like soap. Señora Aleida prepares our first breakfast consisting of one of the many tortas, omelettes, we'll eat over the next couple of weeks. There is bread, butter, fruit and most notably the thick, black Cuban coffee that could probably fuel cars as well as fuel our mornings. She sits with us after we eat to finalize our itinerary. She provides us with detailed instructions on when and where to make our connections, all in Spanish. I understand most of what I hear, but not good enough to answer in complete grammatically-correct sentences. The boy is better in Spanish and so becomes the designated speaker for the rest of the trip. Vicente drives through the Malecón, a highway along the coast of the Gulf of Mexico. Waves are furiously crashing against the seawall. We tighten our light jackets as the weather in Havana is surprisingly mild. Our first stop is Cementerio Colón, the main cemetery of Havana that is full of funerary sculptures and stories. We did not know we could get a map with our US$1 admission. We walked around casually and somewhat aimlessly. One of the security guards approached us after seeing me flinch when I saw two dead chickens lying in one of the small alleys. Santeria, he says, referring to the Afro-Cuban religion brought by the hundreds of thousands of slaves in the mid-16th century. It's part of Cuba's cultural heritage, co-existing alongside Christianity and the Regla Conga, a faith brought by the congos, the slaves from Bantu-speaking regions of the Congo Basin. The chickens are sacrificed for the souls of the dead to rest. He pointed out certain tombstones, ones with stories and immediate tourist appeal. A tombstone with a double-three domino tile on top: the person died of a heart attack while playing dominoes, moments after realizing that the the double-three in his hand was the winning tile. We also passed by the tomb of Amelia Goyri, known as La Milagrosa, who died during childbirth. Now, tourists and Havana residents alike, pray for their own safe childbirth by walking around the grave and knocking three times on the tomb, the same way his inconsolable widower knocked to wake her up. Near the tomb are several votive offerings from believers and miracle receivers from all over the world. Each gravesite is bought by a family. Bones are eventually exhumed and transfered to a separate smaller container at the head of the tomb to make room for the next family member who dies. For the less fortunate, the other side of the cemetary has an area where stone containers with skeletal remains are unceremoniously stacked. Some are marked with a chalked X indicating that family's inability to make payments on the gravesite within a three-month window. Those families who are unable to pay the costs of a gravesite are relegated to this area where remains are out in plain view. We thanked Ivan with a US$5 bill (like a strong Russian!, he said) for the stories that made the cemetery more engaging than it originally appeared. For lunch, we ask Vicente to drive us to a paladar, licensed and taxed restaurants, where we can get our first taste of Cuban food in Cuba. He took us to Aries where we were let in by a waiter who asked us if we had reservations. We were directed to a separate room because we didn't and were surprised when the door was closed behind us with Vicente standing outside. We would later learn that most Cubans are not allowed in the paladares that serve tourists. Even if they were, presumably the US$10 to $25 main course prices would not sit well. We ordered our first arroz con pollo. It came with a side of shredded cabbage and tomato, a salad that will be a fixture of our meals in Cuba. Our next stop is Plaza de la Revolución, the site of the largest Che display in Havana. Hasta la victoria siempre is one of the many revolutionary slogans we will see posted around the country. The plaza is disappointingly empty. However, we were told Cubans congregated here during the Revolution and still do so for commemorative events. The rather phallic memorial dedicated to José Martí is across the street. There is a lift to access the highest point in Havana, but because it is Sunday, uniformed guards stop us from ascending the ramp and entering the premises. Havana's Chinatown, El Barrio Chino, is notable for the complete absence of anyone who looks remotely like us. We get a fair share of inquisitive stares and guesses at our nationalities: Chino! Japon! Corea! Perhaps the irony of being the only Asians in the immediate area is not lost upon the people around us. We're approached by waiters seeking to lure us into their restaurants for lunch. Strangers put their arms around us and tell us they know the best place to get cigars for cheap. While Chinatown's streets are littered and cramped, it's immediately apparent that La Habana Vieja, Old Havana, is where most restoration efforts are concentrated. Naturally, this is where the tourists are, and there are small galleries, gift shops and cafes to service us. The Castillo del Morro, built to protect Spain's fleets from pirate attack back in the 16th century, is on the harbour side. It is illuminated at night as is the Fortaleza de San Carlos de la Cabana, the fortress Che took possession of upon his triumphant arrival after the dictator Batista fled in 1959. Every night the cannon is fired to commemorate the closure of the city walls to protect Havana during the war. We also go to the Capitolio which was built during the era of the dictator Machado. It is styled after the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C. Ask any Cuban and they will tell you that yes, it is inspired by the U.S. Capitol \"but is higher and even more grand.\" We rest and sit on what used to be the Senate's steps. It is now the National Library of Science and Technology. I eat my US$1 ice cream while watching the many bicitaxis and cocotaxis, mopeds encased in yellow round domes, puttering by. Before we head home, we pass by Miramar, the residential area where wealthy families lived before the Revolution and is now occupied by embassies and government offices. The buildings here are all gated. They're absolutely beautiful and well kept. Security guards are all over place. Mercedes Benzs and Audis roll around here. We walked around trying to match flags with the countries. The Philippines and North Korea were two notable sightings. We planned not to have dinner at Señora Aleida's house that evening. While waiting to leave for the Jazz Café, we play a game of Scrabble with her son, Alejandro. He studied computer science in college and is now working as a programmer. The lights go off for a couple of hours, but we continue our game with charged fluorescent lamps while eating popcorn Señora made for us. When the lights return, Alejandro and his girlfriend join us to go to the Jazz Café where US$10 covers dinner and drinks. A live jazz band played some standards while we ate our paella and spaghetti. We drink mojitos and Cristal, Cuba's national beer, while swapping stories about our respective cultures. Related post/s: Havana, Cuba photos on Flickr

Sleeping in a Lighthouse in Saugerties, New York

I've been manic the past few weeks-with the new job and all-and I've been feeling very blue and in need of alone time. There's a whole lot of improvement to be made in order for me to go back to feeling like myself again, and a trip to Saugerties, New York, which took two years in the making and finally planned two months ago, made me realize that maybe I don't have to be always miserable. The Saugerties Lighthouse is on the National Register of Historic Structures and one of the few lighthouses in the country that accepts guests overnight. I read about it a couple of years ago after visiting several lighthouses along the coast of Maine marked on a tourist map, but it was completely booked when I first called to inquire. An article entitled \"Just Beneath the Surface\" published earlier this year in The New York Times Magazine included a beautiful, almost poetic photograph of the lighthouse, and reminded me to call again. The only open night was a Thursday, so I booked it. Fast-forward to a cold November evening and I found myself in a Zip Car driving in the rain past Beacon and Poughkeepsie to get to the lighthouse. It's about 100 miles outside the city. In the town of Saugerties, you park your car just outside the U.S. Coast Guard Station. From there, a half-mile walk in the dark will take you to the beacon of light on Esopus Creek. (I did it, thanks to my extra bright iPhone light!) High tide was a couple of hours before my arrived, so the trail was still squishy and damp. In fact, the lighthouse keeper, Patrick, suggests check-in times to guests using a tide chart. The trek was cold and serene, so as soon as Patrick let me in the lighthouse, I immediately felt warm and comfortable. He gave me a quick tour of the kitchen and the living room before I settled in the West bedroom. An extensive renovation was started in 1986, but its 19th-century feel is intact. Photographs of the lighthouse taken over the years decorate the walls. An old-school fireplace, music player, refrigerator, stove and radio only added to the lighthouse's overall appeal. It was only 6:30pm, but it looked like it was past 10pm outside. Dinner was at Miss Lucy's Kitchen on Partition Street where duck spring rolls, cream of mushroom soup, pumpkin risotto and pork chops from Smoke House of the Catskills were shared. The staff was proud of its use of local ingredients and the food tasted like they were prepared with care. The simple pumpkin risotto was made with tender kale leaves and the pork chops with grilled zucchini. A wonderful dessert of pear and ginger crisp was topped with homemade vanilla bean ice cream. Back in the lighthouse, a bottle of wine was enjoyed in front of the old-school fireplace. The phonograph was cranked up to play some music and the logs in the guest book was read. As I slept in the bedroom, the light above flickered, and I was reminded of how important lighthouses were back during the days of nautical travel. The Kingston-Rhinecliff bridge ahead shimmered in the dark. The next morning, after sharing Patrick's breakfast of pancakes, eggs and sausages with another couple staying in the lighthouse, I climbed the tower to see the lantern. The sky was clear and the view was unobstructed-leaves were still the color of autumn. An extra room stores all the lighthouse's artifacts and a 25-minute DVD taught me all I needed to know about its history. It's admirable how people get together to save a building. I was humbled to stay for one night and wish to be back again. A more recent Times article will not make it any easier to spend a night in the Saugerties Lighthouse. At the time of this writing, 2008 is almost booked. I reserved the only remaining Sunday night for April 2008 on the spot to guarantee a return trip. Patrick has started to accept 2009 reservations. To wrap up the early weekend, a quick hike to Pecoy Notch was in order. There was light snow on my way up. The hike was so peaceful. I hopped on rocks and tree branches to avoid muds and puddles. Slates of rocks were stacked on top of one another to form \"chairs\" at the end of the trail. The view was still exhilarating from 2,900 feet even though most of the foliage was gone. A necessary stop at the Smoke House of the Catskills was made to pick up some delicious salamis and sausages. I made a roast beef sandwich lunch using the spiky horseradish I picked up from the store. A taste of their head cheese only whet my appetite for more wine that night. I've done a few of these convenient trips outside the city this year and I'm liking New York state even more after each journey.

56 MacDougal Street between Houston and Prince 212/254.8640 about $120 for four, with drinks, with tip ♥ 12 Chairs tastes so much better from the outside than inside. We were famished, but another restaurant around the area couldn't accommodate four people for at least another hour. We walked down one of my favorite streets in the city and stopped in front of 12 Chairs. It's one of the restaurants on the block I've been meaning to check out but never remember to visit when I'm in the neighborhood. It looked good when we peeked from the street, so we went inside. And then a shock of light surprised us. Did it all of a sudden transform into a pizza parlor? Why the hell is it so bright inside? We were there with a couple more people, but the space felt abandoned and lonely. The Mediterranean menu looked simple enough, but nothing was so exciting that we just ended up ordering a bunch of appetizers. I liked the stuffed grape leaves-I never skip them when I see them on any menu. A soft yogurt dip drizzled with olive oil came with them. I appreciated that the beets weren't from a can, and believe me, even New York restaurants do that. 12 Chairs roasted them just right. The egg salad guacamole was a more interesting dip than it sounds and a good accompaniment to the falafel and pita bread. The veal dumplings were on the heavier side, and the chicken pockets-I don't know why any restaurant would admit to calling them that-were stuffed with spinach. I was a little more hungry, but because I was already feeling unsure about 12 Chairs, I ordered the safest thing on their list: a medium-rare burger. It unfortunately came with Thousand Island dressing, which I've asked to be left out, but it was satisfying until the last bite. Related post/s: Salt is next door And Provence is down the same street

Whenever I tell people that I don't like sweets, they give me a funny look. Most men think that any living female must like her chocolates and desserts. I really don't. Sure, I have my cravings from time to time, but I'm more than happy to let you eat the rest of that cheesecake or take that entire praline. I was that girl who liked the black cookie more than the white filling. I still am that girl who loves warm waffle cones more than the ice cream itself. So when the new Crumbs Bakeshop in Wall Street opened and cupcakes were delivered to work, I was glad to share eight small and six larger ones to the rest of my group. The eight disappeared quickly because they were way too easy to pop in your mouth. The six lasted a bit longer, but once someone brought out the plastic knives, they were devoured, too. I couldn't get feedback from most of those who participated because they either had nothing to say but describe the cupcakes as \"good\", or they felt too sick to talk from eating too many. Nonetheless, the most common description was, \"It was better than Magnolia,\" which in itself is a big compliment considering the West Village bakery still has a line out its doors from visiting tourists who don't know any better. I had the small red velvet cupcake. I think it may be the color that always attracts me to pick it whenever I crave one. I loved how cake-y it was, which is a big plus for someone like me who prefers the bottom part over the icing. I also tried one of the small chocolate ones and they reminded me of fluffy brownies. From those who were able to vocalize what they were thinking, I received: I had the one with the cherry, white frosting with chocolate drizzle. It was very tasty but I did find it very sugary. Maybe it was me, but I found it too sweet. Otherwise very enjoyable. I had the black and white cupcake. It was very good. The cake was moist and the icing was very true to the traditional NYC black and white cookie taste. I had the Ding-Dong cupcake. (Crumbs calls it The Hostess.) It was too cake-y for me, but definitely better than Magnolia. (I guess, the cake is a matter of preference!) I had the Oreo one. Very good. Forget about dark cobbled streets after the banks and trading floors close in Wall Street; there are residential buildings going up in the area for those who can afford to stay downtown. With new tenants come demands for amenities like convenience stores and restaurants-now they can have their cupcakes, too! The latest Crumbs Bakeshop location to open is at 87 Beaver Street between Hanover Street and Wall Street. You can visit their other branches around New York City or order online.

401 West 24th Street off Ninth Avenue 212/206.6900 $83 for two, with a lot of drinks, with tip ♥ ♥ Bar Jamon was the last loud and crowded bar I fell in-love with here in New York City. That was more than five years ago. I've been to many good bars since then, but only El Quinto Pino has reminded me that all I need is good wine with some good company to make me completely content and happy. Add a small selection of good tapas in the mix and you'd have to push me out the door to get me home. The anchovies in olive oil and the warm chickpeas with spinach reminded me of eating in the boqueria in Barcelona. Simple dishes like them don't need big introductions. I liked the braised pork sandwich better than the breaded cod, but the pig's ears salad, cold and crunchy, was the one that stood out. The deep-fried pork belly cracklings are dangerously addictive. The uni panini might just be the perfect tiny sandwich, spiked with a little horseradish to surprise your palate. There are no tables at El Quinto Pino and you'd be lucky to get a spot at the bar before 11pm. People are in a very good mood, though, and the vibe is infectious. Matt, the bartender, always makes me feel special, calling me by name as soon as I situate myself at the bar. I've witnessed girls and boys alike giggle when he comes up to them. Once, I sat next to an annoying customer who complained about eating sardines when he expected anchovies, and the manager appeased him with a free dish and a glass of wine. My last three visits have been accompanied by several glasses of Cantabria 2003, and even when it's most crowded, I've never had to wait for my glass to be refilled. At El Quinto Pino, I can have another, and then another. Update: I know have a case of the Cantabria wine from El Quinto Pino's wine store, Tinto Fino.

As with my other worldly possessions, I get obsessed with kitchen and food-related items until I run them down. With Nigel Slater's cookbook, I've marked a lot of the photos with scraps of paper to remind myself that there is another recipe that I must try. One of the best photographed dishes in the book is of the taleggio and parsley cake on page 366. I've been using taleggio lately-what with the grilled press I picked up on a whim-and wanted to continue before the smell of autumn turns into the smell of winter without warning. I've changed the name of this dish because I also cooked my first-ever risotto. I didn't have white wine in stock, so I used Japanese sake instead. I'm not quite sure if I made the risotto Lisa's Italian father would approve of, but it was perfectly fluffy for these cakes. I couldn't believe how presentable they looked after the small effort I put into making and frying them. I would love to make smaller versions for the next dinner party I throw. Ingredients: 1/4 pound of taleggio cheese, sliced, rind discarded a handful of parsley leaves, roughly chopped a small block of Parmesan cheese, grated For the risotto: 2 cups arborio rice 1 cup sake chicken broth 1 small white onion, roughly chopped 1 tbsp butter oil 1. Make the risotto. Sauté onions in olive oil and butter. Add rice and stir with a spatula. Add sake, 1/2 cup of the chicken stock and salt. Keep stirring. Cook until all liquid is absorbed. Continue to add stock in 3/4 cup increments and cook until each successive batch has been absorbed, stirring constantly until rice mixture is creamy and al dente. 2. Mix in parsley leaves and cheese when risotto is cool enough to handle. Scoop out a spoonful, pat a chunk of taleggio cheese on it, and then pack it in with another spoonful of risotto, making a small ball. 3. Using a large skillet, heat some butter and oil. Fry risotto cakes over medium heat. Using a heat-resistant spatula and a large spoon for support, gently turn over to cook the other side.

I really think I must have been either an Indian or a Middle Eastern girl in one of my past lives because it's quite insane how I crave curry several times a month. I just made a wonderful tagine last week, so I wasn't really in the mood to be in the kitchen for too long. I wanted to make a small and easy dish that didn't take too much time but still involved my favorite spices. Nigel Slater sauteed some chicken thighs with some fennel. I copied his recipe, but I made use of the baby bok choy in the fridge. Ingredients: 6 chicken thighs 1 pound baby bok choy, thoroughly washed 1 cup heavy cream a handful of cilantro, roughly chopped 4 green cardamom pods, minus the husks 1 tsp turmeric 1 tsp cumin seeds 1/2 tsp chili powder 1 tbsp whole-grain mustard 3 cloves of garlic, minced peanut oil salt, pepper 1. Rub the chicken thighs with salt and pepper and brown them in some hot peanut oil using a large skillet. They should take at least 25 minutes over medium heat. 2. While chicken is cooking, make the spiced paste. Using a mortar and pestle, crush the cardamom seeds and the cumin. Add the turmeric, the chili and the garlic, and continue crushing, mixing in the mustard and some peanut oil as you go. 3. Remove the chicken thighs from the skillet when golden brown. Reduce heat to low and spoon out the oil and add the spiced paste to the skillet. Using a heat-resistant spatula, scrape off the chicken bits from the bottom of the skillet and mix them in with the paste. After a minute, remove the skillet from the heat to keep the paste from burning and add the heavy cream. Return the chicken and add the baby bok choy, plus the cilantro. Cover and let the steam cook the greens for about 5 minutes. Related post/s: One of my favorite yellow curry dishes Awesome with cauliflower pilaf

174 Elizabeth Street between Spring and Kenmare 212/226.4642 $32 for two, without drinks, with tip ♥ ♥ ♥ Good Mexican food is hard to come by in New York City, so when I find a place I like, I try to go back whenever I crave Mexican food that's more filling than one taco off the street. I've been going to Café El Portal for several years now. I've known it as the \"blue underground place\" because of the lively paint color outside and the way you have to take small steps from street level to get in. They have since repainted the façade a more somber washed-out red, but the food remains as satisfying as ever. My favorite is their huitlacoche quesadilla, essentially a corn mushroom that grows within the individual kernels of a corn, disfiguring the ear and turning off any one who wants to eat a perfectly good cob. Oh, but it's delicious when it's cooked, sweetened with onions and flavored with epazote, a Mexican herb with the distinct taste of anise. Café El Portal adds soft goat cheese with it to cut through the overwhelming taste of the mushroom. I can never pass on this dish whenever I'm eating there. If I am, however, in a taco mood, I go for their salty chorizo tacos, served with both beans and rice on the side. They're not cheap on the crumbled chorizo either-two are perfect with the accompanying green salsa. My mouth is watering just thinking about it. While you're there, make sure you order the mango or the strawberry margarita to push all that heavy lunch down.

37 East 28th Street between Park and Madison Avenues 212/213.2328 $180 for five people, with drinks and a lot of comps, with tip ♥ ♥ I can't say that I remember much of our night in Pamplona, but when you dine with four other women, you'd bill forgetfulness as a good thing, too. I was half an hour early, so I sat at the bar for a glass of wine. Being Filipino and alone, I've gotten used to being approached by men with the \"Are you Philippine?\" line. The older man next to me was such a gentleman, I couldn't refuse his offer to recommend and buy me a glass of Spanish white wine. Of course, it turned out that his daughter-in-law is Filipino. My friends arrived and more rounds of complimentary drinks followed. When our new friend left to catch his Knicks game, we were finally seated. We've made enough ruckus in the front of the restaurant that Chef Alex Ureña stepped out to introduce himself. We were famished and ordered the entire appetizers menu to share, and later, the chef sent out several other plates with glasses of sparkling wine to end our night properly. Some of the memorable dishes included the asparagus salad with thinly-sliced chorizo, topped with frisée and baby greens and dressed with pimiento. A meatball dish with eggplants disappeared quite fast, too, with a semi-sweet sherry sauce. I'm not a big fan of shrimps, but the Manchego rice made them fuller and beefier. A suckling pig dish was described by one of my Dominican friends as something better than Christmas pork. One of the things that makes Pamplona irresistible is the fact that the chef serves the dishes he is familiar with, albeit, minus the foam that he learned at El Bulli and experimented with at his first restaurant, Ureña. Nothing is complicated on the menu, but most of the dishes were straight-up delicious. Tapas fans will also be glad that the prices won't break the bank and critics will appreciate that the previous interior design has been stripped to make the space more intimate and inviting.

I asked my parents if ever a balloon popped in my face when I was a kid. I like balloons just fine, but the possibility that one would pop makes me wince. I had the same reaction when I started to use the tagine cooker I bought in Tunisia. (Don't get me started with a pressure cooker!) The potter told me that because there's a pinhole on the top of the cover, that it's safe to put on top of a stove. Because it's also not decorated and had already been fired, it would be all right to use as both a cooker and a serving bowl. To make sure, though, I first boiled some hot water in it with a small drop of oil. There was no popping-I stayed far away from the kitchen-and the water didn't turn blue or anything, so I deemed it safe to use. Today was the first day it felt truly like autumn and I wanted something comforting for dinner. This recipe takes a lot of prep work, so it's advisable to make the meatballs and roast the squash ahead of time. The end product, though, is totally worth all the time you put in. Ingredients: 1 butternut squash, halved 1 large carrot, peeled, chopped 1 red onion, finely chopped 3 cloves garlic, minced 2 tbsps cumin 2 tbsps cinnamon powder 5 saffron threads, soaked in 2 tbsps hot water a handful of parsley, roughly chopped juice from a small lemon 2 cups chicken stock For the lamb meatballs: 1 pound of ground lamb 1/4 cup of cilantro, finely chopped 1 red onion, finely chopped 3 cloves garlic, minced 2 tbsp cumin, grounded 1 tbsp paprika salt, pepper 1. Preheat oven to 350º. Season butternut squash halves with salt and pepper and drizzled some olive oil on them. Roast for about 45 minutes, or until squash meat is tender. Set aside and let cool. When squash is cool enough to handle, score and scoop out the meat into big chunks. 2. In the meantime, make meatballs by forming golf-sized balls with your hands. Brown meatballs by frying them in a skillet with hot oil. Set aside. 3. In a tagine cooker, or a large Dutch oven, sauté garlic and onions. Add carrots, chicken stock, cumin, cinnamon and saffron. Cover and cook carrots until tender. Add browned meatballs and roasted squash. Cover to cook for another 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Mix in lemon juice and parsley. Turn off the heat and keep the cooker covered until ready to serve. Serve with couscous.

Searching for a Good Taco: Roosevelt Avenue, Queens

***CONTENT
The constant rumbling coming from the #7 train above us was a sure sign that we were on Roosevelt Avenue in Queens. From 69th Street, we saw people who looked and sounded like us, but only a few blocks away was a completely different enclave of Queens. The Tagalog signs changed to Spanish and the music coming from cars and storefronts was turned up a notch. Colombian and Ecuadorian flags were waving with Mexico's. There were arepas and ceviches to eat, but today, Miss Geolouxy and I were there to search for a good taco. Queens is the most ethnically diverse county in the nation, where an estimated 44 percent of the more than two million residents are foreign born. The neighborhoods of Jackson Heights and Corona had served as a magnet for a lot of newcomers from Colombia, but the 2000 census revealed a demographic shift in the number of Mexicans. As our basis of comparison, we first stopped by Taqueria Coatzingo on 76th Street because it's the one restaurant that kept coming up whenever I did a Google search for Mexican restaurants in the area. We noted the taqueria stands we passed by, plus the other Mexican stores across the street. Our plan was to start on 76th Street, walk up to 80th, and then walk back down to 69th. 1. Taqueria Coatzingo, 76-05 Roosevelt Avenue, 718/424.1977 You can see from the photo above what I mean by avocado mush-I'm just not a big fan. We ordered one chorizo and one tripe taco, but they sent over two chorizos to our table. We didn't mind because it was our first meal of the day and we were hungry. The chorizo was cut into cubes and was salty enough to whet our appetites, but I prefer my chorizo crumbly. A big plus was the blistered green pepper on our plates. (Note to self: return for the tripe taco.) 2. Tacolandia, between 77th and 78th Streets on Roosevelt Avenue We walked up to the Tacolandia counter and ordered the al pastor and the lengua, or tongue, taco. The tongue looked and tasted like tongue, but now I'm officially confused with what al pastor really is. In Staten Island, al pastor was the meat carved from a vertical rotisserie. What we got was a slab of fat and gelatinous pork skin. 3. El Poblano, 75-13 Roosevelt Avenue, 718/205.2996 We only ordered one cecina taco to go from El Poblanos. The guy at the counter must have thought it weird that we were only ordering one, so he took extra care and put it in a Styrofoam container made for hotdogs. One of the ladies looked at us skeptically when I asked for it to be spicy, but complied. We shared our one taco on a stoop across the street and it tasted like a cecina all right: chewy and dry. 4. Taco stand on the corner of 75th Street and Roosevelt Avenue The two ladies serving up the tacos were tickled when we asked for their permission to take their photographs. They even had an official translator who sat in the van parked right next to the stand. The beef taco, as Miss Geolouxy said, looked better than it tasted. We couldn't negotiate the hot sauce to come out of the squeezy bottle, so we doused our taco with the green pepper sauce instead to give it some sort of taste. They had the pickles, too, but they looked pretty gnarly, even for me. 5. Sabor Mexicana stand, directly outside the subway exit on 75th Street and Roosevelt Avenue For our last taste, we ordered two tacos: a suadero, or stewed beef, and for the safe bet of having something tasty before going home, a chorizo kind. The chorizo was crumbly, which I've already mentioned I like, and the tips were toasty and crunchy. The beef was just tasteless and dry, almost inedible even with hot sauce. After only a couple of tacos, I wondered if we should have gone to Corona for Mexican food. There were a couple of Mexican restaurants and a few stands selling tacos, but it wasn't like my experience in Staten Island where there was a Mexican-something every other door. There wasn't an outstanding taco, and the frequency of adding avocado mush surprised me. The avocado wasn't chunky, but thin; it reminded me of Calexico's \"avocado sauce\" in SoHo. After our first taste, I had to remind myself to say, Todo, pero no aguacate.

wish the people at coatzingo had gotten your order right! their tripe taco is outstanding; extremely rich, very offal-y, and delicious with a twist o' lime. I kinda like their avocado sauce; eaten at pretty much all the places you mentioned, but I keep going back to coatzingo. if you eat in, try their milanesa cemita with either beef or chicken; a delicious, almost overwhelming sandwich best eaten immediately or in the restaurant; painstaking stacked layer upon layer of pure deliciousness and the whole marinated and smoked pepper (poblano?) is key.

My mother doesn't like the smell of cloves nor anise. When I use them, she never fails to tell me that they remind her of the dentist office. I'm not exactly sure what smell she's referring to, but to me, the combination of cloves, anise and cinnamon, smell like the forest after a good amount of rainfall. Plus, I really like my dentist. It had been raining the entire morning-so much for peak autumn season-so all I wanted was to stay home and cook something that would cheer up the kitchen. When I saw Seckel pears at the farmers' market in Cold Spring, I bought a couple of pounds thinking of that smell. Of all commercially-grown pears, Seckel pears are the smallest. I love them for their size and they look good preserved in a glass jar. I think preserved spiced pears are good with heartier dishes like goose, lamb and rabbit; the pears' syrupy juice a nice complement to gamey meat and crusty bread. Ingredients: 1 pound Seckel pears, peeled, stems intact 2 sticks of cinnamon 2 whole star anise 4 cloves 1 cup white sugar 3 cups of water, or enough to cover 1. Place pears in a saucepan and cover with water. Add the spices, uncovered, and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer covered until they're tender when pierced with a fork. 2. Allow them to cool in the syrup and then transfer to an airtight container and refrigerate. Related post/s: Me and pickling Use your pears, but do less work

My greatest discovery the past couple of years is taking the Metro-North train to get out of the city from the 125th Street Harlem station. I've already picked cherries in Dutchess County this past summer and I just came back from a weekend hike in Beacon. During that hike, the leaves were already turning up in the mountains. I wanted to take my parents to see the same view, but on a much less grueling excursion. The Metro-North's 4th annual fall foliage trip was touted on subway billboards. I bought tickets for the three of us just in time for the season's peak. Unfortunately, it rained the entire day, although a lot of people still showed up from three stops: Grand Central, 125th Street and Tarrytown. We all boarded a special train with a tour guide telling us about the towns and sights we were passing by. It was wet and gray outside, but the orange and red leaves were still showing through the haze. Despite carrying our umbrellas to protect us from the rain, my parents were still good sports. We spent a few hours in the town of Cold Spring going in and out of antique stores and buying produce from the farmers' market, with only a break to eat pizza for lunch on Chestnut Street. We took photos in the river front's gazebo, at the park and on the church grounds. My mom was tickled by the 10-cent trolley ride up Main Street. The rain let up an hour before we had to meet at the train station for our ride back to the city, but we were able to stop by the pumpkin carving event set up by Scenic Hudson, an environmental group focused on the Hudson River Valley. We didn't carve any of the pumpkins, but it didn't stop the organizers from giving my dad the discarded seeds and our own giant pumpkin to take home.

Fragrant Rice-Stuffed Cornish Hens

I could barely cut the carrots after my bootcamp workout, but I was determined to eat after preparing and cooking this dish for an hour. I was looking through my archives and remembered how robust the rice mixture was in the Greek gemista, or stuffed tomatoes, recipe. I wanted that smell of herbs and raisins together, but I also wanted to eat, believe it or not, chicken. Cornish hens were on sale in my supermarket, so I ended up picking them instead. They're smaller and takes less time to cook anyway. I called my mother to make sure there were still raisins in the cupboard. She also had walnuts handy, so I used them in lieu of almonds or pine nuts. The great thing about stuffing is that you can use almost anything. If I found leftover bacon in the fridge-yeah, right-I would use them; same for chopped Chinese sausages or sautéed ground meat. I threw in arugula and baby carrots for more festive coloring. The result? Fragrant rice-stuffed Cornish hens a month before Thanksgiving. Ingredients: 2 Cornish hens, washed thoroughly and dried with paper towels 2 cups cooked rice 1 small carrot, roughly chopped 1 cup golden raisins 1/2 cup walnuts, crushed 2 handfuls of arugula 3 cloves garlic, minced 2 shallots, finely chopped 2 tbsps pomegranate molasses 2 tbsps chili powder salt, pepper, oil 1. Preheat oven to 350º. In a small bowl, mix some oil and chili powder with salt and pepper until pasty. Spread paste all over hens using a spatula. Let marinate while you prepare the rice mixture. 2. To prepare the rice mixture, sauté garlic and shallots in some hot oil. Add carrots and cook until tender. Add arugula and mix until wilted. Add the rice, raisins and walnuts. Mix well. Season with some salt, pepper and molasses. Toss for a few more minutes until all the flavors have penetrated the rice. Remove from heat. 3. Spoon some rice mixture a little at a time and stuff the inside of the hens. Use a spatula to make sure you get as much rice in the hens as possible, but without over-stuffing. Transfer stuffed hens to a baking dish and bake for 45 minutes, turning after 20, or until clear juice comes out of the thighs when pierced with a fork. Switch the oven to broil and brown the hens for 8 extra minutes. Related post/s: Gemista, or stuffed tomatoes Greek style I do like my Cornish hens and pomegranate molasses

The day after I came back from Tunisia, I had bacon for breakfast, pork barbecue for lunch and was craving pork chops for dinner. We didn't participate in Ramadan while we were there, but not having pork for two weeks was difficult enough. You simply can't take the pork away from the Filipino. When pork chops look firm and fresh at the butcher's, I can't help but pick them up. Add some honey for a little bit of sweet, sticky taste, and a little oyster sauce to make them salty, and they evoke autumn-in that Chinese sort of way. I scraped the leftover bits of marinade from the pan and tossed a bunch of boiled baby bok choy with it to make a vegetable side dish. Ingredients: 4 pork chops about 8 tbsps honey 4 whole star anise 3 tbsps oyster sauce 4 cloves garlic, minced dried chili flakes black peppercorns salt 1. Make marinade. Whisk together the honey and the oyster sauce in a small bowl. Add anise, garlic, peppercorns and chili flakes. Season with some salt. Using a spatula, rub the marinade onto the pork chops on both sides. Set aside for at least an hour or refrigerate overnight. 2. When ready to cook, preheat the oven 350º. Bake for about twelve minutes per side. The marinade burns easily, so check on the chops often to make sure that you do not overcook the meat.

It was a little too warm for fall in Boston, so we decided to take our time and walk to Centre Street to eat brunch. We joined the queue outside Centre Street Cafe when we arrived. We probably waited for half an hour, but our coffees from J.P. Licks a few stores down kept us alert and patient. By the time we were seated, we were famished. We also had a wedding to go to in a couple of hours, so despite the appetizing menu, I was able to control myself from ordering a whole plate of bacon and eggs. We split two dishes: an arugula salad with goat cheese and walnuts, and the Amish breakfast which consisted of a poached egg, melted cheese, roasted butternut squash and potatoes. They touted some of their ingredients as organic, and I have to say that we had a satisfying first meal that didn't weigh us down. Is the wait worth it during busy brunch times? Perhaps. There were more people waiting behind us. But a girl who waits four hours for a table shouldn't be dispensing any advice. Centre Street Cafe is on Centre Street, #669A, in Jamaica Plain, Boston.

The three of us met inside the Metro North train after a last-minute plan to get out of the city to welcome the first weekend that felt like autumn had finally arrived. We were in Beacon, New York after a 90-minute ride. A short cab ride brought us to Bob's convenience store where Tracy picked up our overnight bags. From there, we started the climb up the wooden stairs and then the next four hours to Malouf's Mountain Sunset Camp. Malouf's Mountain Sunset Camp is a hike-in/hike-out campground perfect for city dwellers who long to get out of the concrete jungle and hike the northwestern slopes of the Fishkill Ridge without worrying about the drive, the luggage, and the camp itself. For $70, we reserved what they call a platform site, a tarped balcony-like space sans the walls nestled within the trees. A picnic table with chairs, a tabletop stove and a tent were included. Our mini-kitchen came with pots and pans and a few plates-enough to cook pasta and ramen for dinner and corned beef for breakfast the next day. We had a fire pit we used to serve me my first smores. There is a common building suited with dryers, a few bathroom stalls and hot showers. There are also vending machines for Twix emergencies. The hike itself was only difficult because we were unfit. It took about four and a half hours to follow the well-marked trails and find our way back when we lost our sense of direction a few times. (We are city people, after all.) The day remained cloudy and somewhat humid, but it was cool enough up in the mountains. At each stop we made, we were rewarded with the view of the Hudson River and the autumnal colors of the east coast.

Malouf's sunset camp is a dream-come-true for city dwellers. Being able to hop on a train, hike through beautiful forests (with amazing views of the hudson valley), and to camp in comfort in a privately situated campsite is a great opportunity for those who long to escape urban life and reconnect with nature. They even have food options which allow you to cook awesome meals right at your site. They also supply you with a \"chow box\" which provides you with all of your camping needs. The hiking routes to get there range from very easy to moderately-difficult, so there is something for everyone!

623 Eleventh Avenue corner of 46th Street 212/977.1500 $70 each for a whole pig for 12 people, with two sides, BYOB ♥ ♥ There are a few annoying things about reserving a group table at Daisy May's: 1. You can only reserve half a pig or a whole pork butt to feed up to six people 2. Your other choice is a whole pig for up to twelve people 3. It's BYOB-that's annoying because 4. you only have two hours to eat and drink, from 8pm to 10pm, and 5. you also have to bring your own ice and your own drinking glasses If you have more than five friends, then you're forced to do the whole pig, but your group needs to have twelve or else each person pays more to contribute to the bill. You know half a pig is enough for you and your big group of friends, but alas, rules are rules. When you arrive at Daisy May's for your Big Pig Gig, however, you forget every annoying thing about the restaurant. Even though I've done so many pig roasts in my life, the whole pig is still a sight to behold when served on a large wooden block, halved and then chopped in smaller pieces. The meat is juicy and soft and even better with the accompanying brown sauce. But the skin is disappointingly chewy and inedible. There is no crunchy tail to be found, but our chosen sides, creamed corn and the sweet potato, more than compensated. We barely touched the Texas toast and the coleslaw that come with any of the Big Pig Gig, but the watermelon, although bland, was a good finish. The staff gave us covered plastic containers when we paid our bill. Most of us were able to take the leftovers home. I took home the head and it was made into Filipino lechon paksiw the next day. Daisy May's serves the pigs that keep on giving. Related post/s: I also like Dinosaur Bar-B-Que For no reservations but a longer wait, go to The Spotted Pig

Ah, fall. There were those weird couple of days when the weather turned muggy and humid, but it now feels like Mother Nature is catching up. The leaves are starting to turn and I'm beginning to feel too lazy to get up from my warm and cozy bed. All I want is to drink a full-bodied red wine and eat some lamb. After I start my day, that is. This was an easy recipe from Nigel Slater's The Kitchen Diaries. I'm not at all familiar with him, but the book design was so tempting that I couldn't leave Strand bookstore without it. I initially wanted to use lamb chops instead of the suggested neck, but when I went to the halal store next door, they only had the neck left. I also picked up three chungus, the African eggplants they always have in stock. Ingredients: 2 pounds neck of lamb, chopped 3 plum tomatoes, halved 2 baking potatoes, peeled, chopped 1 large eggplant, chopped 1 large red onion, quartered 6 cloves of garlic, peeled 5 sprigs of rosemary olive oil, salt, pepper 1. Preheat oven to 400º. Season lamb with salt and pepper. Set aside. 2. In a shallow roasting pan, toss all the ingredients together, except the lamb, with some oil, salt and pepper. Bake, uncovered, for thirty minutes. 3. Remove roasting vegetable from the oven, toss gently and add the lamb. Turn the oven heat up to 425º and roast for another twenty minutes, or until the lamb is golden brown and slightly pink inside.

I can always count on Cameron to introduce me to something simple, yet presentable, in the kitchen. I've had figs before, of course, but their taste never jumped off my plate. At least until she served a mixed salad with them one night when I came over for dinner. It was a bright appetizer that started off an equally delicious meat dinner. After a recipe search, I bought my own fresh figs and preserved my own. Ingredients: 12 pieces of fresh figs, washed, halved 1 cup sugar 1 cup red wine vinegar 1 tsp whole cloves 1 tsp nutmeg 1 tsp cardamom, grounded 1 tsp black peppercorns 1 tsp powdered ginger 1 tbsp cinnamon powder For the salad: 1 head of frisee, torn in smaller pieces a handful of walnuts, crushed a large chunk of Gorgonzola cheese, crumbled olive oil 1. In a bowl, combine all the spices with the sugar. Add the vinegar and stir until completely mixed. Add more sugar if it's too sour to your taste, but it should be a perfect balance of tart, spice and sweetness. 2. Put the figs in a sealable glass jar. Pour in spice mixture. Cover and refrigerate for a week. To make sure that the figs get equal treatment from the spice mixture, invert the sealed jar every day or so. They should be ready, and preferably consumed, after a week in the fridge. Related post/s: I love pickling and preserving

I walked in Sur La Table to pick up some kind of exotic dark chocolate to satiate my craving last week and I ended up leaving with something heavier: a cast iron grill press. I don't know what came over me, but as soon as I saw it in the store, I had to have it. I imagined using my Le Creuset grill pan more and pressing the beef steaks and the lamb chops I expect to cook this autumn and winter, but then The Times published an article devoted to grilled cheese with a recipe from Los Angeles. I first discovered taleggio at Otto on their mushroom pizza. I remember that after tasting it, I went to Di Palo the next day to buy some. I baked it with mushrooms, too, but using a tart shell. Taleggio has a very strong and tangy smell that I find appetizing, so my mouth watered as soon as thought of it melted in between pressed bread. And who doesn't like paninis, right? You can use a heavy pot lid-cast iron if possible-if you don't have a press. I used cinnamon raisin bread instead of just raisin, and I picked up the apricots from the dry goods aisle. I love the arugula here, so if you can get the spicy kind, the better. As a last touch, I sprinkled some of Terra de Sal's flor de sal from Portugal. The sandwiches made a very sophisticated brunch on Sunday morning. Ingredients: half a pound taleggio cheese, rind removed, at room temperature 8 slices cinnamon raisin bread 15 dried apricots 1 tbsp capers 1 tbsp Dijon mustard half a stick unsalted butter, softened in microwave for 15 seconds arugula, throughly washed and dried with a paper towel olive oil, salt 1. Place apricots in small saucepan and add enough water just to cover. Bring to full boil and immediately remove from heat. Mix in capers, mustard and teaspoon of olive oil. Pulse in blender to chunky consistency. Set aside. 2. Spread one side of each bread slice evenly with some butter. With buttered sides down, top four slices with a spoonful of the apricot mixture, a handful of arugula and equal portions of cheese. Top with remaining slices, buttered side up. 3. Place large skillet over high heat and melt a small knob of butter. Reduce heat to low and add sandwiches. Using an iron grill press, put on top of the sandwiches and press. Cook until browned and crisp on both sides, about 2 minutes a side. Transfer to a platter lined with paper towels, and sprinkle each with a pinch of salt. Cut in half and serve.

Mloukhiya, Tunisian Beef Stew

***CONTENT
My new thing lately is buying cookbooks when I travel. My latest is a Tunisian cookbook with all of its recipes written in French. The Internet was very helpful when it came to figuring out what I needed to do to make it edible. It wasn't just the pretty food photographs that made me buy it, but this mloukhiya recipe. When the Dr. and I were traveling in Tunisia and scouring the food markets, one of the least familiar spice we saw for sale was that of the corete of Japan. Whenever we asked the seller, they told us it was powdered spinach because of its color. A trip to the grocery store in Carthage solved the mystery. I went to the spice aisle and picked a packet up with an English translation of its contents. I later found out-happily, too-that the mloukhiya plant is what we Filipinos call saluyot because the English name of the plant translated to corchorus. This recipe is a beef stew using the powdered leaves simmered for a long time until it is thick and almost black. You know it's done when it has the consistency of stewed okra. My father is Ilocano, but I don't remember ever eating, or liking, saluyot. I may have to revisit those childhood memories. Mloukhiya is generally prepared to celebrate Eid al-Fitr, the Festival of Fast-Breaking, or the end of Ramadan. Because I've inundated you with Tunisian stories for the past two weeks, I just thought it was appropriate to publish this recipe today. I still have to check out the African store in my neighborhood to see if they sell the spice. Ingredients: 1 1/2 pounds of beef chunks 1 large onion, quartered 1 packet of powdered mloukhiya 3 cloves of garlic, minced 3 bay leaves 3 sprigs of mint leaves, leave some for garnish chili flakes salt, pepper, oil 1. Season the beef chunks with salt and pepper. Cover and refrigerate until ready to use. 2. In the meantime, in a large Dutch oven, add the mloukhiya in 8 cups of water and some olive oil. Slowly stir with a heat-resistant spatula until the powder is fully-mixed in. Use the spatula to keep the mloukhiya from sticking to the sides of the pot. 3. When the mixture takes the consistency of a thick cream, bring to a boil, uncovered, and then lower the heat and simmer, covered. Stir occasionally and pour in a little water from time to time in order to maintain its initial volume. 4. Add the beef chunks with the rest of the ingredients and continue to simmer for about 2 hours, or until beef is cooked through. Season with salt, pepper and chili flakes.

Interesting enough to research and comment on. It left me with an odd cross of feeling definitely not hungry yet not weighed down or tired. (I feel I may not need to eat for a few days.) An acquired taste, like for a form of special, health giving food, one would eat before/ or while going on a long hiking expedition.

Cap Bon Peninsula to Carthage to La Marsa

To wrap up our two-week vacation in Tunisia, we just had to drive around the Cap Bon and end up in La Marsa so we could drop off our rental car and catch our flight out of Tunis. From Kairouian, our scenery changed from small town to suburbia. Nabeul is the country's ceramic center and is increasingly the place tourists go to to escape the beach resort town of neighboring Hammamet. We drove to the souq and checked in our cheapest accommodation to date, Pension Les Roses, at 15 dinars a night. At that price, or about US$12, there were no extra amenities. In fact, I had to ask for the owner and pay an extra dinar to unlock the bathroom door for me when I wanted to use the shower. I'd like to think that I'm an excellent packer-I finally got to use the just-in-case bed sheet on our bed. We had a balcony that looked out to the souq and the roof of the building next door. The marble columns and tall blue shutters in our room reminded us of the places we stayed in Cuba: family houses frozen in time. But as the tourists left town, the stores closed and it was difficult to look for a place to eat. We tried three recommendations from our guide book before we lucked out at L'Olivier, a German-friendly restaurant. Surprisingly, the mussels and squid were not overcooked, plus the fish stew with couscous was delicious. We ended up splurging for about 40 dinars including a few beers. We left Nabeul the next day and made a few stops around the peninsula. It was a sunny and gorgeous day and driving the winding roads reminded us of wine country and the Pacific Coast. Kerkouane's main tourist attraction is its Punic settlement ruins. Because the town was set on the coast, forts and towers were built to protect it from attacks. Excavations of kilns have also revealed it as a town of craftsmen and merchants. From the color of the water next to the ancient site, we imagined it was a very pleasant place to live. The coastal caves of El-Haouaria were off-limits when we arrived. There was a small sign warning visitors of falling rocks, so all of us who tried to get a closer look of the yellow sandstones ended up walking around La Daurade Restaurant's backyard instead. When we thought nothing could be more beautiful than the view of the Mediterranean from El-Haouaria, we discovered the hot spring town of Korbous. The road was hugged by steep cliffs and narrow ravines and the sea stretched as far as our eyes could see. We wanted to stay here for the night as soon as we saw the small houses atop the coastal cliff-face and asked a guy at the Thermales et Touristiques to show us a room. It was a ghost town, but apparently, Tunis' locals vacation here because of its hot springs and water treatments. The room we saw looked out to the blue, blue sea, but alas, it was unkempt and dirty because it wasn't the high season. We were sad not to stay. Carthage, the home of military hero Hannibal, was the setting of Dido and Aeneas' romance in Virgil's Aeneid. It was considered one of the greatest cities of the ancient world, and thus, also World-Heritage listed. Although its remains and sites are scattered about-you can't tell its history right off the bat with the BMWs and the 250-euro nightly rate at Villa-Didon-its epic past is still impressive. What gave me the chills, however, was not the amphitheater ruins, nor the Carthage Museum on Byrsa Hill, but the manicured lawn of the American WWII cemetery on rue Roosevelt. There are 2,840 graves honoring the soldiers who died during the war and a Wall of Remembrance is devoted to the 3,724 others who were never found. It was so peaceful in there that we felt like we were trespassing. It was a humbling experience to be reminded of the horrors of war. We ended up in La Marsa for the night at the American-owned Hotel Plaza Corniche. We met the older man who owned the place. We ended up chatting with him and his business partner after we found out we were all New Yorkers. The restaurant was next to the hotel pool and dinnertime was obviously its busiest. We were surrounded by big groups dining loudly and by young female locals out on a date with older male foreigners. Plaza Corniche was definitely the place to be in these parts. Kitschy as their decoration may be-there is a neon palm tree, Chinese lanterns and statues of butlers-we enjoyed our stay there because it allowed us to wind down and get ready for our flight back to the States. It was only too bad that they didn't allow us to eat the wine and cheese we bought from the grocery store in the town center. We wanted to sit and eat by the pool before dinner time our last night, but the receptionist told us that we had to go back to our room if we wanted to eat something we didn't buy from their restaurant. Because of that, we stepped out for dinner and refused to spend another dime there. I suppose it was just like being in New York City. It was time to fly home. Bi-salama, Tunisia, and bari kelorfik.

From Mahdia, English John, the Dr. and I jumped in the car to catch the sunset at El Jem, Tunisia's most impressive Roman monument. It would have been more impressive, of course, if we actually made it inside. We arrived in El Jem just a little before 6pm after a 45-minute drive. When we walked to the gate, the guard told us El Jem closed earlier because of Ramadan. The sign said closing time is at 7pm. We begged and pleaded for him to let us in, even for just fifteen minutes, so we can take photographs from inside, but he shook his head and pretended he didn't understand French. Funnily enough, he spoke enough French to ask us for 10 dinars each. We refused to give him a bribe to let us in. We walked away from the gate, cursed him so that he doesn't get to enjoy the forty virgins in paradise and just walked around what was once the crowning glory of ancient Thysdrus, a town that enjoyed prosperity in the first few centuries. El Jem is amazingly intact. It is is also a World Heritage-listed monument and is considered the third largest colosseum in the Roman world. Emperor Gordian reportedly committed suicide inside when a rebellion against Maximus was becoming obviously doomed. It was a bummer not to watch the sun set from inside, but like the Dr. said, C'est la vie. The next day, we left English John and Mahdia and started our drive back to Tunis. We made a quick stop at Monastir to pay our respects to Habib Bourguiba, the man responsible for Tunisia's independence from France. In 1934, Sorbonne-educated Bourguiba led a movement to break away from the ruling Destour Party. On April 9, 1938, the French killed a lot of its supporters demonstrating in Tunis. Bourguiba was arrested and sent to exile to France. Years later, he was able to bring international attention to Tunisia. By 1954, the French announced negotiations for Tunisian autonomy, and when an agreement was reached a year later, Bourguiba returned home a hero. The country was granted independence on March 20, 1956 with Bourguiba as prime minister. When it became a republic, he was declared its first president until President Ben Ali toppled his government in November 7, 1987. Today, every Tunisian town has an Avenue Bourguiba and an Avenue 7 Novembre. The mausoleum itself is reached via a long, paved walkway with green and gold arches and a marble courtyard. Monastir's star attraction, though, is its ribat, or defensive fortress. It's Tunisia's finest example of Islamic architecture, with its labyrinthine passageways and staircases. Unfortunately, it is also promoted by the tourism board as the film set for Monty Python's Life of Brian, including the scene where Tunisian extras laugh at Biggus Dickus. From Monastir, we went back inland to visit the fourth holiest city of Islam, Kairouian. We were told that seven visits to Kairouan equals one visit to Mecca. Since it's an important pilgrimage destination and North Africa's holiest Islamic site, it's also World Heritage-listed. Non-Muslims are only allowed through one of the nine gates of the Great Mosque. We arrived there at 2pm and missed the opening hours, so we followed a young kid who took us to the roof of the carpet shop a few doors down to see the view of the domes. This privilege required us to browse through the store's carpets and uncomfortably say no to all of them. We also followed the boy to Bir Barouta, a well whose waters is supposedly connected to the well of Zem-Zem in Mecca. Drinking the water from its well is an important moment for those who believe that. The water didn't make me sick, even though we've read that you have to drink at your own risk. The scene inside, though, is a little bit more staged-a camel with colorful scarves hanging on its side, walks around the well to turn the wheel that draws the water. We left a couple of dinars for the man who ordered the camel to start moving in Arabic. Feeling like we've given enough dinars to Kairouian's locals, we returned to our car and left for the Tunisian north cape.

We said good-bye to Houmt Souq, Jerba, and drove a long way up the east coast to Sfax. On our map, Sfax and Sousse were the two locations besides Tunis that looked like busy cities because of several roads connecting them with surrounding towns. We vowed to skip the tourist traps when we first looked at our road map, but since there was no way back up to the capital without avoiding at least one of them, we chose Sfax. In our guide book, it described Sfax as bypassed by packaged tours and the place to see what most people say is the best medina in the country. We parked our car and walked through Bab Jebli, one of the original Aghlabid gates, an Arab Muslim dynasty. We bought some fruits to eat since no restaurant inside the medina was to open until sundown. We went inside the fish market where the action was in full swing even in the middle of the afternoon. We also walked through Souq des Etoffes where the Cairo market scenes from The English Patient were filmed. We shot one of our best videos while in there, but it was hard for me to point and shoot with my digital camera without being stared at by the locals. The medina was a chaotic mess. Even so, we knew that they are laid out according to strict Islamic principles. We appreciated that the narrow streets kept the sun's rays at bay, and that the stones cooled the afternoon air. We seemed to have walked for almost an hour before we found Hotel Enasser right smack in the middle of the busy market. No one we asked wanted to help us out. Some of them didn't speak French and they waved us away or just turned their backs on us whenever we asked. By the time we checked in and paid for our 25-dinar room, we were exhausted. When we made it back to our car, I asked the Dr. sheepishly, Can you keep driving or do you think we should stay? He agreed that we should leave for a more quiet town before it gets dark. We went back to the hotel and painfully tried to get our money back from the receptionist. I watched as he argued with the Dr. in French about how we just broke his heart by changing our minds about the town he grew up in. Yada, yada. We probably didn't give Sfax a chance, but our first impression was that it was like Manila: polluted, crowded and noisy. We just weren't in the mood for too many sensations at once. So we left and kept driving up to the next town of Mahdia. It is situated along the Mediterranean and described as a small fishing village, \"the sort of place to spend a few days resting from the rigours of life on the road.\" That sounded good enough to us after our Sfax experience. In Mahdia, we drove on a narrow street along the water-we knew we've come to the right place. We parked and hauled our packs through Place du Caire and checked in a rooftop room in Hotel Medina for 15 dinars. Sitting in the rooftop terrace as the afternoon breeze gave movement to the drying blankets was like arriving in a quiet beach after an assaulting day of getting there. We met our roof-mate, English John, who was traveling sans girlfriend. The three of us ended up having dinner together by the fishing port at Restaurant de la Medina and hunting for beer at Le Lido right after. It was weird to be talking to someone in English-I certainly felt like it was the first time I had a real conversation with anyone besides the Dr.! All this time, it had been the Dr. doing the talking in French, so English John's company was definitely comforting. The next day, the Dr. and I explored the coast. We walked to the fragments of the original Fatimid walls along the shoreline, through the Muslim cemetery and the Punic necropolis. We didn't go inside Borj el-Kebir, a large fortress situated on the highest point of the peninsula, but we did end up all the way to Cap D'Afrique where the local kids jumped off sharp rocks to swim. After spending some time on the beach and before we set off snorkeling with Subway, one of the only two water activity companies in Mahdia, we visited the markets. We were inspired enough with the excellent produce we saw that we actually planned a home-cooked meal. The spices were much cheaper than in the souqs we've visited, the vegetables more colorful and the meats-the meats!-were more alive! I was like a kid on Christmas day. That night with English John, the Dr.'s four-spiced medium-rare lamb chops with fried mullets were on the menu with my watermelon tomato salad and pickled cucumber appetizer. English John walked to the same bar from the night before and provided the booze as his contribution to our night's elaborate meal. We used our hands to eat and finished every morsel. Hands down, it was the best meal we had in Tunisia in what became our favorite place in the country.

We slept some more as Taha and Emin drove us the next morning to Matmata. The roads started to disappear and this is why only 4×4s are allowed in the desert. More camels and rosemary bushes dotted the side of the road. From the top of Matmata, we saw how Mother Nature carved stones and created sand mountains. Matmata is known for its troglodyte homes built underground to provide respite from hot summers and random invasions. Hotel Sidi Driss, five pit courtyards connected by underground tunnels, was where-surprise-Star Wars was shot. Tourists go in and out of the hotel to take photographs and have pushed the locals to the Nouvelle Matmata on the other side of town. As we were leaving Matmata, we asked Taha about Gabes. He said there is absolutely nothing to see there. (What? He didn't mention that it was Obi-Wan's home!) We checked our map and wondered about the island of Jerba jutting out of Gabes. According to legend, Ulysses stopped there in the course of the Odyssey to persuade his crew to get back on board after the natives, or the \"lotus-eaters\", gave his men flowering food that made them forget about going back home. How awesome is that tidbit? It is now one of the last places in Tunisia where Muslims and Jews peacefully live side by side. We were definitely intrigued. Taha turned our SUV around and stopped another car he happened to know was going to Jerba. A young Japanese couple was inside and we introduced ourselves as our drivers talked. Luckily, the Japanese agreed to give us a ride to Jerba. They really had no chance to say no as their driver started loading our backpacks in the back of their car. The ride was quiet, but it became less awkward as soon as the Japanese started talking to us. We found out that they have been with their driver for the last four days and were also fasting with him. Like their driver, they were on their fourth day of Ramadan. It was a noble gesture, something we couldn't even imagine doing during a vacation, and it surely broke the ice. The driver said, Filipinos? Thumbs down. Japanese? They do Ramadan with me! and gave them a thumbs-up. About an hour and a half later, we boarded the ferry to Jerba. From Jerba, we entered the town of Ajim and were dropped off at Houmt Souq, the city center. (Note to Jase: Ajim was also Mos Eisley.) In the heat, we carried our packs to Hotel Arischa, an old funduq with a 56-dinar nightly rate. A funduq was an inn where traveling merchants stopped by to rest during the Ottoman period. The gate was big enough to accommodate camels and their load. The first floor was usually a warehouse where the animals' needs were stocked and the second floors were the sleeping quarters. Each door came with giant locks and barrel bolts. We decided to spend two days to enjoy the town's souqs, or markets, and the island's beaches. Hotel Arischa became our favorite accommodation. Now without a car, we had to hire a cab to take us to the public beach. The beach was disappointingly full of litter, so we ended up walking to the beachfront of the Radisson Hotel where several Europeans were already red from too much sun. It was like entering a music video, with shady tents, a large turquoise pool and staff clad in all white serving cocktails on trays. We paid 30 dinars for a mojito and a caipirinha. Alas, we had to pay New York prices for a little bit of sin in a Muslim country. Back in town, we walked in and out of the covered souqs to see the potential souvenirs we may be able to take home. Each town has its specialty, but most of the time, sellers offer the same products: clay pots, tagines, shisha pipes and leather poofs. From all the towns we've visited so far, we've enjoyed the produce markets more than the shops. In Houmt Souq, we watched the fish auction. Men who sat on elevated chairs displayed strings of fish provided to them by their fishermen. Bidders, which include restaurant owners to housewives, shouted out a price to buy the freshest of the fresh. We noticed that one of the auctioneers had a jasmine flower behind his right ear. I later read that if a Tunisian man has a jasmine flower behind his right ear, he is single and is looking for a wife. (Guess where the Dr. put his jasmine?) A man who puts a flower behind his left ear is proud to be taken and married. We craved seafood after visiting the fish market. Dinner was at Restaurant D'Ille, a recommendation from one of the funduq employees. The sea bass we ordered for 10 dinars was so small, it didn't look like the sea bass we were familiar with. We just figured that they had a different translation for the real sea bass. We ordered two beers and a half bottle of a very strong rose wine. Together with another plate of lamb and couscous, our meal was a splurge for 56 dinars. It was hard to explore the rest of the island without a car. It didn't take us a long time to succumb to the idea of renting another car that we can drive all the way back to Tunis. The next morning after breakfast, we picked up a new rental from Europcar. We drove to the La Seguia beach where we sat by the channel and watched an old man fish all morning. Stupid jet skiers disturbed the peacefulness. We swam for a bit and read and sunbathed. Then we drove to the south, with a stop at the Cave d'Ali Berber where a guide showed us a typical Berber home, and an underground tunnel where he gets clay for his pottery. I was a tourist, so I was forced to feed a baby camel. We bargained for a cooking tagine for 25 dinars. Later, we found out the same tagine cooker started at 35 in the souqs, but if you start to walk away, the desperate sellers can go as low as 10 dinars. I'm usually good at bargaining, but it was difficult to haggle when you've been cornered inside their store and when they block your way out. We also drove near the water to see the unkept Guellala Mosque. Our next stop was the Jewish synagogue of El-Ghriba, an important place of pilgrimage during Passover. It was bombed in 2002, so visitors now have to go through the X-Ray machines before entering. We took off our shoes and wore head coverings before we walked in to listen to the old men read aloud from the holy book. We also checked out the metal hangings left by devout pilgrims. The sanctuary reportedly has one of the oldest Torrahs. For the rest of our last day in Jerba, we planned our final week in Tunisia. Dinner was at Restaurant Les Palmiers. For 17 dinars, we ate the usual salade Tunisienne, rice with lamb stew and a grilled dorade. It was a warm, breezy night. We sat outside and joined the men for the night's mint tea while the mosque next door announced that Allah is great.

After pricing three companies while in Tozeur, we settled with Au Coeur du Desert which charged us 350 dinars for a two-day tour. Our English-speaking guide, Taha, and his brother, Emin, picked us up as soon as we returned our car to Europcar, the rental agency. Taha drove like a maniac, but he was very charismatic. His heavily-accented English was easy enough to understand, but we couldn't help but think of \"sexy-time\" every time he talked. He also looked like the restaurateur in The Sopranos, only happier and less desperate. He knew our itinerary well and he talked whenever he had something to show us along the way. The rest of the time, he and Emin spoke and laughed to each other in Arabic while we listened to how animated their conversations were. Our first stop was Chott el-Jerid, the salt lake where Luke Skywalker contemplated the two moons in the first Star Wars movie. (I am probably the least knowledgeable person concerning Star Wars, but I feel I must add that point so that my friends will be able to relate. When I started telling them that I was going to Tunisia, their response always had something to do with the movie.) We stopped at where the locals have left a boat, a fake camel and a \"4-star hotel\" straw tent. The lake measures at least 5,000 square kilometers. It stretches to emptiness as the salt shimmers in the heat. Around us were pools of saltwater in red and yellow colors. About two hours later, and after a brief stop to take photos of some sandstone pyramids along the way, we arrived in Douz. There were restaurants opened for tourists who weren't participating in Ramadan, but we didn't want to eat fried chicken nor spaghetti. We separated from Taha and Emin to hide and eat our usual bread-and-canned-fish lunch. Our throats were parched, so we could only imagine how thirsty they were. Even without water for hours, though, they still entertained us until we reached Ksar Ghilane. We arrived at Campement el Biben in the middle of a very hot afternoon. We were shown where we were to sleep for the night: Bedouin tents. Bedouins are tribes who travel the desert, but today the term is used to refer even to non-Arabs who live simple, nomadic lives. Their tents are made of thick canvas, which almost feels like wool, and are meant to withstand all sorts of weather when used in the desert. Although we had the tent set-up, we were still spoiled by the beds inside and the bathroom with running water at the other side of the camp. We spent the rest of the day lazing like dogs and swatting off flies, as we tried to sleep or read. It was hotter than being inside an oven. When it was almost sunset, we were rescued by Taha to introduce us to our camels. We knew that the guides had to be home by sundown to finish the day's fast, so we only signed up for an hour ride around the dunes. Ksar Ghilane is surrounded by the dunes of the Great Eastern Erg, the most alluring desert scenery in Tunisia. It was our first time on camels. It was a thrill to get on one and hold on while the camel took three steps to stand up. At first, the camel will make you lean back to get its footing on the sand, and then all of a sudden, it will lean forward to position itself to get up. And then, when you think you're already set, it will lunge forward to actually stand up. I later learned that all camels in Tunisia have only one hump, or the Dromedary type, and that two-humped camels, also known as Bactrians, only exist in the deserts of China and Mongolia. The novelty of riding a camel actually runs its course after about fifteen minutes. I can't imagine how those who choose to ride it for days feel. But the scenery of the dunes was exhilarating. The sand is seriously a red-orange color, marked with waves and swirls left by the soft desert breeze. We let our guide and his camels go home and we finished watching the sun set behind the dunes. There was nothing to do, really, but enjoy the moment. As the clock hit 7:32pm, Taha and Emin reached for their bottles and guzzled water. We all laughed out loud as Taha pointed to the clock and told us he was now free to eat and drink. But, of course, being Tunisian, they still offered us half of the freshly-baked damper bread they received from one of the locals when they ended the day's fast. This kind of bread is cooked in the ashes of a camp fire in the desert. It's more dense than the typical bread we've been buying in town bakeries, and also taste so much better. For dinner, the camp's staff served a plateful of spaghetti and fried chicken under the stars. For extra 4 dinars, we also had our first drink of the local beer. (We had been craving any type of liquor for the past five days, but they were very difficult to come by unless we walked in the nicer hotels and restaurants.) We were thankful that even a Muslim country like Tunisia makes its own beer. After eating, we sat outside our tents and watched the stars. Before the lights were turned off, we entered our tent and looked forward to sleeping a very peaceful nomad-style sleep.

We had a long way to go to Tozeur via Gafsa, so we woke up early to start our drive to Kasserine. The rolling hills switched to empty lots of cacti. As our surroundings started to become flat, more and more locals started to hitch a ride to the nearby towns. We saw an older man in a long purple tunic on the side of the road, trying to wave down cars. I joked to the Dr. that we should pick him up to buy some good karma. To my surprise, he stopped the car on the side of the road. I was squealing before he rolled down the windows on my side! The old man didn't speak French, but we all understood \"Kasserine\" and he got on the back seat. It was a quiet and awkward ride for the next fifteen miles because he only spoke Arabic, but he managed a faint \"Monsieur\" to let us know he wanted to get out as soon as we drove by the city center. During Ramadan, some stores remain open for business. We found out fresh bread was easy to come by during the day, as well as fruits and drinks. In Gafsa, we stopped by the only open patisserie and ordered four pieces of small, triangle pastries. They were wrapped in phyllo and filled with almonds and pine nuts. They were not serving tea, so the lady refused our payment when we finished. We were simply tourists passing by her town, but we were shown such great hospitality. Picking up the old man wasn't so bad after all. (When the Dr. bought water from another store, the man tending the place asked him what a guy \"like him\" was doing in the middle of Gafsa.) We were on our way toward the desert. The roads started to become drier and dustier. We started to see road signs warning us of camels crossing. We initially thought that they were just a ploy to entertain tourists, but we laughed as soon as we caught our first glimpse of camels far away, just chilling on the side of the highway. In Tozeur, we drove in circles before we found Residence el-Arich. We checked in our airy and tiled room that looked out to a courtyard filled with palm trees. We missed the sunset from the Belvedere Rocks because we also couldn't the right turn. The cop stationed outside the zone touristique recognized our car by the time we circled a third time. We made it to Belvedere Rocks as soon as the sun disappeared behind the horizon. The rocks were ugly anyway as the most recent landscaping included a golf course and a playground. The face of Tunisia's most revered poet, Abdulkacem Chebbi, was cut into the rocks. (My first reaction? \"That better not be John Fucking Kennedy!\" I have nothing against him, of course, but I didn't come all the way to Tunisia to see an American's face etched in sandstone.) Right outside the souq, or market, of Tozeur, we found Restaurant Paradis where we had a nice dinner of couscous with lamb, a cucumber salad and ragout of green peas, all for 13 dinars. An old man ran the place and he offered to move the table and chairs outside so we can enjoy the nighttime breeze. We ate heartily as we watched the men go in and out of the mosque next door. On our way home, our favorite cop flagged us to stop. When driving in Tunisia, there are several roundabouts and police inspections on the road. As driving tourists, we have enjoyed the privilege of simply driving slowly past the cop, waving and continuing on without having to go through the inconvenient inspections all locals treat as routine. When we were signaled to stop our car, we got a little bit nervous. The cop walked over to the Dr.'s side and handed us a date. He stopped us to give us a date! He also kept us for the next twenty minutes, excitedly chatting about Tozeur's palmeraie-where the date came from-and the Dr.'s ability to speak perfect French even though he is \"clearly\" Japanese. Inspired by the date, we visited the palmeraie the next morning, Tunisia's second largest with at least 200,000 trees. It was an amazing sight to see clumps of trees in the middle of the desert. It's a great example of tiered oasis agriculture where the system is watered by more than two hundred springs that produce more than 60 million liters of water a day. The best way to explore it is on foot, so that one can go through the narrow paths along the irrigation canals, but we had to be packed up by 9am. We were off to the Sahara, where we would be needing all the water we could get.

We were awaken by the first call to prayer of the day. A man's voice echoed through the loud speakers but we still got up later than expected. The staff at Les Mimosas still served us the free breakfast of hard-boiled egg, bread, butter, coffee and orange juice. We checked out, sad that we didn't get to take advantage of the pool with a view of the city, and visited Les Aiguilles, or the Needles. They are spiny pinnacles of rock that jut out of the Old Harbour Bay, but they were less impressive than we originally thought. We drove towards the zone touristique and chose Malibu Beach to set our beach blanket and enjoy the early afternoon. There were a lot of Czech people there, most of them sunbathing topless while young Tunisians gaped from the beach. The Mediterranean was warm enough to swim for more than an hour straight but cool enough to keep us on our toes. We weren't keen on staying, though, because the beach was littered with cigarette butts. Back in town, the first day of Ramadan was pretty obvious. All the restaurants and cafes were closed. Grills all around the port looked lonely and unused. We went to one store that was open and bought what would be our usual Ramadan lunch for the rest of our stay: a loaf of fresh bread, canned fish and Coke. This time, we added some pickled olives and vegetables from the market. We parked our car under a big tree back at Les Mimosas because we knew we can't just eat in front of those who were more pious than us. Our small homemade lunch was pretty good, and we ate knowing that from sunrise to sundown, the Muslims will refrain from eating or drinking for the next forty days. We drove past Ain Draham, by the Kroumirie Mountains and rolling hills covered in cork trees. We made a detour to Bulla Regia, a Roman site with underground villas intact. We paid the small fee to enter, plus the extra dinar to carry my camera, and a guide followed us to the site to show us around. The Neolithic tombs around the site proved that the area was inhabited before the Romans arrived. \"Regia\" was added to the town of Bulla after the Byzantines took over. We felt the sun burning our shoulders, but the temperature dropped as soon as we walked underground. (It was difficult to drink from our water bottles in front of a man who hasn't had a drop since sunrise.) We walked through the House of Treasure, the House of the Peacock, the House of the Hunt and the House of the Amphitrite, where a mosaic of Venus flanked by two centaurs came alive as soon as our guide doused water over the tiles. The baths, the forum and the amphitheater were all equally amazing. We left and continued our drive to Le Kef, also called El Kef. It didn't take too long, but the Dr. was tired. We checked in Hotel-Residence Venus. For 40 dinars, we had our own bathroom again in our room. Our blue shutters opened to the mountains behind the medina. No one seemed to be in the hotel except us, even though our guidebook touted September as the beginning of the high season. As the first day of Ramadan was wrapping up, we noticed the groups of men hanging outside the cafes. Le Kef was absolutely great for people watching. Hundreds of men sit on plastic chairs lined along the streets with nothing to do but talk and hang out. Not one woman can be found outside. As the afternoon call to prayer signaled the end of the day's fasting, just like that, the streets emptied out and turned into a ghost town. It was eerie to see no one all of a sudden. We were thankful for a stranger's recommendation to eat at Ramzi, the only restaurant lit on rue Hedi Chaker. Without any prompting, we joined the staff in breaking the first day's fast. We were first served shorba, or hot spicy soup. And then a plate of briq was put on the table. This one was the regular kind with chunky potatoes, but still with the ubiquitous runny egg. Traditionally during Ramadan, a meat or pasta course follows the two kemias, or appetizers. We chose the kamounia, a meat and offal stew seasoned with lots of cumin. But as fast as they all went inside to eat for the first time in twelve hours, the men all stepped back out to resume to their original positions-this time with hot, green mint tea on hand. Still no women around, so it took balls for us to enter one of the cafes and order the same tea that the men were having. To my surprise and delight, a couple of the older men gave up their seats for me. Fresh mint leaves are stewed in hot water for several hours until they turn the water black. The tea is poured in a small glass from high to create a froth and a lot of sugar is added to make it syrupy. It's strong and painfully sweet at times, but we found ourselves joining the men after dinner throughout our stay in Tunisia.

As soon as we drove away from the city, the landscaped changed. Olive trees lined the highway and dry, earthy dust covered the air. We arrived in Bizerte after an hour, parked our car in front of the municipal building and walked to the Old Port. Bizerte sits on a canal that links the lake to the Mediterranean Sea. Small wooden boats were docked at the port, while the tall fortifications of the kasbah (fort, or citadel) flanked the fishing town. We went inside the market to check out the local goods. There were the usual bananas and grapes, but there were also prickly pears and doughnut peaches. The fish market had only the freshest produce, from the small sardines to the extra large swordfish. The meat market was far more interesting. A cow's head, with its eyes opened, was hanging; all its innards displayed on the tables. I asked a vendor for permission and he let me take a photo of the head, but wagged his finger at me when I started to take a photo of the stomach lining and the bloody mess on the counter. Inside the medina (or the old and traditional section of a city), a maze of stone walls guided us from narrow street to narrow street. It was dirty and rundown. We had to step over a few piles of shit. We even saw two dead kittens. We walked by a restaurant called Marco Polo right outside the medina and noticed an old man grilling fish. It was busy with lunching Tunisian men, and so we immediately knew it was a good place to rest and eat. We sat inside to stay away from the blistering sun. The Dr. was ordered by the owner to buy fresh fish back in the market if we wanted to eat fish. He bought a kilo's worth of what he thought were sardines. When the owner shook his head, he walked with him back to the market to exchange the fish with the correct type. We waited only a few minutes before we were served two platefuls of the grilled sardines with salad meshouia, a cold plate of roasted vegetables swimming in olive oil. For dessert, we crossed the street and bought mint tea which every Tunisian-Muslim man seemed to drink in lieu of alcohol. Fortified, we walked back to the municipal building after lunch to find an empty street. Our car was towed! Panicked, we went inside to ask a stranger where and how we can get our car back. We took a cab to the parking lot, paid 30 dinars, and drove away with our rental. It wasn't as much of a hassle as losing our luggage, but it still freaked us out. Why do we always have to be taught a lesson when we're traveling? (See speeding ticket in Iceland post.) It was time to head to our destination for the night, Tabarka. But first, we took a detour to Lake Ichkeul, a World Heritage-listed national park where different species of birds fly by from the Sahara en route across Europe. Apparently, a water buffalo was imported, too. We saw a flock of swallows and heard geese honking, but the only water buffalo we saw was the statue at the park's entrance, where there was no admission fee, but the guard asked us for a \"donation.\" (He took out a blank piece of paper when we handed him a couple of dinars and wrote our names down to make us believe that our contribution was going elsewhere besides his lunch allowance.) We did a quick hike around the mountain where the view was so different from the city's. The marsh was dry and the shallow lake was surrounded by cacti and swarmed with mosquitoes, but it was breezy at the top. We felt immediately better. The sun started to set, so we left in a hurry and started our drive to Tabarka. The drive from the small town of Sejnane to Tabarka was like being in California. More olive trees surrounded the hills, but figs and eucalyptus also wrapped the valleys with lush greens. It was almost 9pm when we checked in Les Mimosas Hotel. Our bedroom with private bath and a terrace looked down the town center and out to Genoese Castle. It cost us 64 dinars. After moving our stuff up, we walked to the main street to look for dinner. We found a restaurant with only an Arabic sign. We ate a spicy version of meshouia salad (thank you, hidden Serrano peppers with seeds intact), an overflowing ojja, a stew of tomatoes, chilies and merguez, or sausage, with an egg stirred in before serving, and my first Tunisian briq, a flaky, deep-fried crepe of runny eggs and, curiously, tuna. We also encountered our first harissa, a red chili paste seasoned with garlic and caraway seeds. Harissa is what kimchi is to Koreans-we ended up looking for it every time we sat down for a meal. We also ordered a bowl of hsou, or spicy soup with semolina and capers, but the owner sensed that we were already full and canceled our order. We went back to our hotel room and enjoyed the night view from our terrace. Tabarka was waiting for us the next day.

We arrived in Tunis-Carthage airport after a connection in Paris minus the Dr.'s backpack. We originally planned to start our drive to the north of the country without stopping in Tunis, but this setback, although minor, was still annoying. We took care of everything first: filed a claim for lost luggage, exchanged our dollars to dinars ($1 = 1.25TD), picked up our rental Fiat, bought a SIM card for our phone. We knew we had to look for a place to stay in the city for the night, but navigating the crazy streets proved difficult. The locals sweetly crossed the street without any regard for vehicular traffic. Other cars sneaked in right next to us as if in a video game docking explosions. By the time we checked out a hotel room in the city center, we were so spent. We couldn't get our car back to the front of the hotel, so we decided to just keep driving. (Our apologies to the hotel clerk!) The coast to Sidi Bou Said was a much prettier and less harried drive. It smelled less like Diesel and more of the Gulf of Tunis. Set on a cliff, all we can see were white buildings with blue window grills; bougainvillea spilling out of high walls and fences. The streets were narrow, so we parked at the bottom of the hill and checked in Hotel Sidi Boufares. For 75 dinars, we got a double room with our own bathroom. The ceiling was high and made of red bricks; the walls with tiles of different patterns. Our door was, of course, painted in that Sidi Bou Said blue, complete with metal studs and a heavy knocker. The owner talked to us in English, but I knew I will have to defer to the Dr. for the rest of our vacation when people outside the city will start speaking in French. (We think it's a perfect travel arrangement: I plan, he speaks; I look pretty, he drives!) We ate at Rais Labhar for our first experience of simple Tunisian fare. The restaurant offered pizza and spaghetti, too, but we ate the salad Tunisienne, a mix of lettuce, olives, cucumber, peppers and flaked tuna. I had the under-salted grilled fish and the Dr. opted for the overcooked beef steak. A least our hunger pangs were satiated. We later found out that 22 dinars for so little food was too expensive. We walked around town, past all the souvenir shops and haggling Europeans, to take photos of the Andalusian architecture. The blue tint grew on me, as well as the metal details that dot the doors and the windows. The sun started to set over the white domes, and as the other visitors boarded their giant buses, the town quieted down and emptied out. Later, a call to prayer we overheard coming through the town's loud speakers reminded us that we were in a new place. The five calls to prayer each day will remain to be the most impressionable for the next two weeks. I was ready for the new tastes and different smells I will encounter. We were reunited with the Dr.'s pack at night time. For dinner, we walked down the hill and stopped by a hole in the wall to eat a chawarma with beef the clerk peeled off a spit. For 2.50 dinars, it was a much more satisfying fare than lunch. We were ready to start over the next day. Related post/s: Day 1 in Tunisia: Sidi Bou Said photos on Flickr

What to do with potatoes before leaving for vacation? I always feel bad when there's still a lot of produce in the kitchen before I go away. I hate wasting food and I wanted to use the herbs I also had sitting on the counter. I was too busy packing, so I wanted to cook something that would take little prep time and attention. This potato gratin is, of course, incomplete without a medium-rare steak and French onion soup, but let's just say I did this to practice for a bistro meal come winter. Ingredients: 2 large potatoes, peeled and sliced paper-thin 1 cup heavy cream 1 cup Parmigiano-Reggiano, grated 2 garlic cloves, minced 3 sprigs fresh thyme some fresh chives, chopped, plus more for garnish salt, pepper 1. Preheat the oven to 375º. In a large bowl combine all the ingredients, tossing to coat. Season with salt and pepper. 2. Put the potato mixture into a deep baking dish and arrange by flattening out with a spatula. Bake for 40 minutes, until the potatoes are tender and the gratin is bubbly. Set aside for 10 minutes before serving. Garnish with remaining chives. Related post/s: How about a nice steak with that?

After biking from Glencolumbkille to Maghera Beach, we drove to the small town of Ardara to take a break. Nancy's is the ultimate Irish pub because it has been around for several generations. Its namesake is the great-grandmother of its current owner. There are hundreds of trinkets hanging around the pub, and each piece looked like it told a story of Ireland or one of the pub's family members. The place looked small from the outside, but as soon as I ventured out to look for the women's bathroom, I discovered other small, more private rooms around the entire lot. Upstairs, the family's bedrooms are open in order for a visitor to finally get to the bathroom. It felt like I trespassing, but at the same time, it also felt like home because of everyone's hospitality at the bar. Only in Ireland will I be asked if I fancy a pint with a plate of oysters at 1pm. Of course, I happily obliged. Nancy's House is in Ardara in County Donegal, Ireland.

Teach Barnai, or Barney's House, is a family-run restaurant with an impressive menu. It feels like somebody's home, especially when you sit by the fireplace downstairs for a pint while waiting to be seated. We were seated in the more intimate space on the second floor, and it felt like we were having our own party in our own apartment. I was assigned to pick a bottle of wine before dinner. As soon as I selected the Gigondas, the owner and manager, Michael Carr, told me that he was going to open it right away to let it sit and air out. I knew I was going to have a good night then. When he heard that I hailed from New York City, he showed me a photo of Sarah Jessica Parker and Matthew Broderick. Apparently, they have a vacation home a few streets down and occasionally have dinner here when they are in town. I didn't really care about anything New York City related when I was in Ireland, so instead, I inquired about the monkfish offered on the menu. They wrap the beautiful fish with bacon, sear it, and then finish it up in the oven for about 10 minutes. I politely made a request to take my order out of the oven after only 5 minutes. Everyone in our table had a taste and loved my monkfish's perfect tenderness that I was told the chef, who is also Mr. Carr's wife, might just start cooking all their monkfish that way. I ended up having the best meal in the entire restaurant, with the Gigondas like icing on the cake. Update, 2007: Teach Barnai is on the Main Street of Kilcar in County Donegal, Ireland. When I was there in 2004, I was told that Mr. Carr's wife was really sick and they were looking to sell the place. I haven't heard of any other updates since then.

At first I doubted that my body could do a second bike tour-cold and wet while fighting strong winds and pedaling downhill. When I saw the itinerary—fifteen miles from Glencolumbkille to Maghera Beach, passing through Glengesh Pass—I was prepared to accept the helpful van rides along the bike route. But it was probably our guide Johnny Daly's infectious laugh that brought the sun out the morning of our first meeting in Glencolumbkille. For the first time during my week-long trip to Ireland, I thought that the sun would stay out, and it actually did! From Millstone B&B, I biked on concrete and dirt tracks, passed by flocks of sheep, and had an amazing view of open bog, dotted only by a handful of small houses and miles and miles of dry stone walls. At times, I stopped to take photographs or to stay out of the way of some of the most aggressive sheep I've ever encountered. (I still laugh every time I think about how they tried to scare me off track!) Only once did I have to walk my bike, and that was uphill near Maghera Beach. We walked the rest of the way to the dunes and the caves of Maghera. The slabs of quartzite rocks were spectacular—a testament to the power of erosion—and the water was calm enough to let us walk on rippled sand. Irish Cycling Safaris is unlike any other bike tour because you're not forced to bike with a group. Much like Irish Cycle Tours, I was handed a map with directions to follow, and I was free to bike at my own pace. It was during this bike tour that I was able to experience quiet time, allowing myself to appreciate and take in Ireland the way I never expected after the first few days of mist and rain.

I've always been turned off by tour guides because from what I've experienced, they talk like broken records and they really just do it because it's their job. Enter Sean Mullan of Walking and Talking in Ireland. He has been walking the walk and talking the talk for about five years, and it showed. Tours turn into experiences when you're accompanied by someone who actually has a passion for the place you're visiting. There are new lessons learned when your guide can answer every question you have without consulting any prepared speeches. Sean Mullan opened my eyes to this country I knew nothing about. An enlightening two-day tour, Walking and Talking in Ireland made me wish all tour companies operated Sean Mullan's way. We hiked Slieve League on the West Coast of Donegal, the highest sea cliffs in Europe known not only for its elevation but also its color: a range of brown to rust to orange and beautiful shades of green. Right from the beginning of our hike, we had an inspiring view of the cliffs, displaying miles of quartzites and slates that make up the mountain. We walked by unusual stacks of rocks known as the Giant's Desk and Chair while the waves violently crashed against the cliffs thousands of feet below us. From where we stood, we saw other groups continuing the hike along One Man's Path to the summit. The Atlantic Ocean stretched miles beyond what our eyes could see. At times, I had to be careful when taking photographs because of the strong winds, but the hike was as exhilirating as anyone can imagine. Sean Mullan let us take in the view—a view I thought only the top of Waimea Canyon in Hawaii could provide. Thankfully, I was proven wrong. We also traced the pilgrimage of one of Ireland's three patron saints, Colm Cille, or St. Columba, believed to have driven away the demons of Donegal from the valley to the sea around 500 A.D. Gleann Cholm Cille, or Glencolumbkille, translates to the \"valley of Colm Cille\", and every 9th of June, devotees stop at fifteen stations along the north side of the valley to touch the ancient inscribed stones and marked iron plaques for penance. We stopped by an old church and paid our respects at the small cemetery outside. Among our other stops were the Folk Village Museum and the Napoleonic Tower. The Folk Village Museum exhibits rural Donegal lifestyle and was started by a local priest named Father James MacDyer in the 1950s. He provided jobs to the locals by encouraging them to set up craft cooperatives. It sells local wares and souvenirs and also houses the Tea House, where we took a break after walking along the beach. The Napoleonic Tower was built by the British to protect their country from an invasion by France through Ireland. The hike up to the tower took only under two hours, but we stayed a few extra minutes to rest and watch the sun go down. In true Irish fashion, we witnessed a dark cloud pour rain over the valley below us while we were simultaneously enjoying the soft glow of the afternoon sun on top.

I was craving Chinese take-out for some reason-the bad, oily and saucy kind-and so my mouth watered when I read this recipe in the Sunday Times. I bought a large eggplant on my way home because our neighborhood supermarket doesn't carry the small and thinner Asian kind. The large ones have darker and tougher purple skin, so I took more time simmering them here. As usual, I followed Harold McGee and salted the eggplant pieces after I sliced them. This draws out the moisture and collapses their spongy texture, so they don’t absorb all the oil when sautéing. I realized I ran out of soy sauce when I was ready to make the sauce. I ended up using the kecap sambal in our pantry instead. It's made of soy beans but also includes relish. I also used the last dollop of kochujang sauce I had in the fridge. Looks like I need to make a trip to Chinatown soon and restock my Asian pantry. Ingredients: 1 large eggplant, cut into smaller chunks some ground pork 1 tbsp kecap sambal 1 1/2 tsps sugar 1 tbsp cornstarch 1 tbsp kochujang sauce 2 stalks of scallions, finely chopped 2 garlic cloves, minced peanut oil salt 1. Place the eggplant chunks in a large bowl. Sprinkle with salt and toss. Set aside. 2. In a small bowl, whisk together the kecap sambal, sugar, kochujang sauce and cornstarch until the cornstarch dissolves. Set aside. 3. In a large wok, heat some of the peanut oil over high heat. Sauté garlic until golden brown. Add scallions and cook until soft. Add the pork and cook, stirring, until no longer pink, about 2 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the pork to a plate. 4. Dab eggplant dry with paper towels. In the wok, heat some more oil over medium high until it just starts to smoke. Add the eggplant, and sauté until lightly browned and tender, about 10 minutes. Add the sauce mixture. Cook, stirring, for about 1 minute. Once the sauce thickens, add the pork back and 3/4 cup water. Bring to a boil, and then reduce to a simmer until the sauce thickens and the eggplant is tender, about 25 minutes, stirring occasionally. Season to taste with salt.

We spent our first night in Ballycastle. During dinner, Ian from Irish Cycle Tours stopped by to introduce himself. The next morning, after my first Irish \"brekkie\" of bacon, eggs, grilled tomatoes, and black and white pudding, we biked from Ballycastle to Portballintrae and made our first stop at the Carrick-a-Rede rope bridge off Ballintoy. For my first bike tour ever, I was pretty surprised (and pleased) that all I had to do was ride—I was free to follow the map that was given to me and pedal at my own pace. Everything was provided for, including a helmet and a small bag for our cameras and water bottles. The map mentioned a mile of uphill biking, but it failed to say that the next four miles had more than a dozen smaller hills! I was forced to walk my bike most of the time because I was not prepared for a full workout. My big Irish breakfast just went through me. The weather did not make it any easier; rain pelted my face, my raincoat was soaking wet against my back, and I was fighting 65-mile per hour winds. We were all pedaling downhill to make it to Carrick-a-Rede, which became the trip's joke for the next seven days. I was disappointed with myself for not being strong enough to bike the entire way. I felt better, though, when I realized that no one in their right mind would push on with that weather, but I did! From the parking lot, I had to walk about a mile downhill to catch a glimpse of the rope bridge, only to be stopped by one of the National Trust guards because of the strong winds. I saw how high and angry the surf was thousands of feet below, and it was probably best that they'd closed the gates. I walked back uphill to meet the rest of the group for tea instead. During tea, we all rested our butts off and read about Carrick-a-Rede. The rope bridge is eighty feet above the sea, and it provides access to the tiny island across the chasm for salmon fishermen. Carrick-a-Rede translates to \"rock in the road,\" the road being the sea migration route of the salmon. Across is Puffin Island, which supported a colony of puffin birds but has since been renamed Sheep Island because it was used to graze sheep after the birds moved on. We also saw from afar Rathlin Island, which is still inhabited by less than a hundred people whose ancestors have resided on Rathlin for hundreds of years. The weather was not getting any better, so we all decided to give up our bikes and end our bike tour. We stored them in Ian's van and instead drove by what is left of Dunseverick Castle, a castle from the 1500s said to have been visited by St. Patrick. We could have seen other small ruins on the island, but the call of a pint of Guinness was louder than any other tourist stop around us.

Baby Back Ribs Adobo

***CONTENT
In Memories of Philippine Kitchens, Amy Besa and Romy Dorotan say that if you have to master a Filipino recipe, it has to be adobo. Adobo in Spanish-speaking countries refers to the oil, garlic and vinegar flavor. Each country has added its own touch to it, whether they be black peppercorns, marjoram or bay leaves, but if you ask a non-Filipino about a Filipino food they've tried and liked, adobo is most likely their answer. It's hard to get my father to teach me how he cooks his own version, since he cooks by tasting the dish until it's just right. When Dexter and Jaime gave me a copy of the new book from the Cendrillon founders, I tried their baby back ribs recipe. I've cooked adobo before, but I have to say that they got it right in terms of measurements-all I had to do was double everything to feed four people a couple of servings apiece. I'm going to use this recipe as my own from now on. Ingredients: 3 racks of baby back ribs, about 4 pounds 2 cups white vinegar 2 tbsp soy sauce 8 garlic cloves, minced 6 bay leaves 2 tsps black peppercorns 1 tsp red chili flakes 2 tsps rock salt 1. Using a mortar and pestle, crush the garlic and the peppercorns until they are coarsely grounded. Rub the ribs with salt, and then with the garlic and peppercorns mixture. 2. In a Dutch oven, mix vinegar, soy sauce, chili flakes and bay leaves using a wooden spoon. Add the ribs and marinate overnight, turning the ribs at least once so that the other side also gets some of the flavor. 3. When ready to cook, put Dutch oven over medium fire, uncovered, and let boil. Then reduce heat, cover and simmer for 1 hour to cook the ribs. Remove ribs to a baking dish when done. Reduce the sauce by increasing the heat and cooking it, uncovered, for about 10 minutes or until the sauce has somewhat thickened. 4. Broil the ribs for about 8 minutes, enough to give the top part a crust. Transfer to a plate and pour over the reduced sauce. Serve with steaming white rice.

After a couple of hours of sleep in a hotel in Dublin, we set off for the Mourne Mountains in Newcastle. Martin McGuigan met us for tea and sandwiches to talk to us about Walk on the Wild Side and to tell us about the day's itinerary. He has been running his company for about three years, but he has been involved in outdoor activities all his life. Who better to take you to walk up the Mourne than an active Northerner? It had been drizzling on and off, so we made sure we packed our raincoats. During our drive, Martin sang the famous Mountain of Mourne song for us by Percy French. It was very appropriate because our drive along the coast consisted of dips and uphills, allowing us to catch a glimpse of the small-town lifestyle against the Irish Sea. I had a smile on my face when he was singing—it was what I expected from the people I was to meet during this trip. I hadn't been in the country for more than twenty-four hours, and I was already pleased. We started our hike along the Bloody River, and Martin talked to us about the Mourne. Its highest peak is called the Slieve Donard, and it goes up to about 2,700 feet. The mountains only occupy a small part of the county of Down in Newcastle, but there are over twenty hikes to be done in the area, from short walks and strolls to longer treks. The Mourne is also known for the dry stone walls that encase the two reservoirs in the Silent Valley, which provides water for most of Northern Ireland. I saw my first rainbow in Ireland, but we did not make it too far up because the rain would not let up. We paused to share the cake and tea that Martin packed, and we began our descent back to our car. Related post/s: The Mourne Mountain photos on Flickr I walked with Marty McGuigan

I'm going to be away for two weeks, so I thought I'd pickle again so that it's ready when I return. At Fairway, they had some fresh Israeli cucumbers for sale. They were small enough to fit an old pickling jar I kept, so I picked up nine pieces with some dill and mustard seeds. This is totally not the Filipino style of pickling and I had to combine two other recipes I found on the Web until it sounded just about right to me. We'll see in a couple of weeks! Ingredients: 9 pieces of Israeli cucumbers, washed 1 bunch of fresh dill, washed and ends sliced off 2 tbsps mustard seeds 1 head of garlic, peeled and minced 2 cups of white vinegar 1 1/2 cups of water salt 1. In a large bowl, submerge cucumbers in iced cold water for at least 2 hours. Set aside. 2. In a small pot, let the vinegar and water boil with some salt. 3. When ready to pickle, put half of the garlic and half of the dill at the bottom of the jar. Add cucumbers. Pour in the salted vinegar and water mixture. There should be enough to cover the cucumbers. Add the rest of the garlic and dill with the mustard seeds. Cover the jar with its lid and seal tightly. 4. Boil some water in a pot, large enough for the jar. When water is boiling, put the sealed jar and let it sit in the boiling water for 15 minutes. Turn off the heat and let the jar cool. When cool enough to handle, remove the jar from the water and dry with a paper towel. Store in room temperature for a couple of weeks before opening. Related post/s: How do Filipinos pickle?

Pork Sinigang, Filipino Sour Soup

What would be your last meal on death row? It took me a while to answer that question, but the more I eat pork sinigang, the more I stick with it as the last thing I want to eat before I go. It's my comfort food and it's the dish I request from my father when I return from a trip. If you ask the Dr., it's also his favorite Filipino food. Back in the Philippines, I grew up eating it many ways. The only requirement is its sour taste, but the sourness always depended on where the cook was from. The most familiar to me is using tamarinds. We had a tree in the backyard and the tamarinds would be simmered in a pot to make the sinigang broth. Kamias, or bilimbi, was also used by squeezing them and straining the juice. Nowadays, though, Knorr makes the soup base with the concentrated flavor of the tamarind. They sell for 80 cents in Chinatown stores. I like this dish best when the sourness hits the back of my ears and my left eye uncontrollably closes, so I usually end up using the entire packet. I add a Serrano pepper towards the end to give it an extra kick. As for the vegetables in sinigang, Filipinos use kang kong-called swamp cabbage or water spinach in Chinatown-but you can certainly use other vegetables that don't have a bitter taste. Broccoli and long string beans, or sitaw, are easy. Okra is also good, as well as daikon radish and eggplant. I've tried daffodil leaves but they didn't work. Using a crock pot allows you to slow-cook your spareribs without paying attention to them. Leave it overnight or cook it while you're at work. Eight hours will leave you with meat falling off the bones. My way is to slow-cook in a Dutch oven for at least an hour and a half, removing impurities that rise to the top using a ladle. Filipinos love their pressure cookers, but those things scare me. Besides, I like taking my time when I cook. Ingredients: 6 spareribs 1 packet Knorr Tamarind soup base 1 tomato, halved 1 red onion, quartered 1 green Serrano pepper, cut in two 1 bunch kang kong 2 small eggplants 1 small daikon radish salt 1. Use a Dutch oven with enough water to cover the spareribs and simmer for at least two hours. Remove impurities that float to the top. 2. When spareribs are ready, bring to a boil and add tomato and onion. Simmer until tomato is bruised. Add the vegetables and cook until tender. If using eggplant and okra, add them last to avoid overcooking. 3. Add tamarind soup base and salt to taste. Saltiness and sourness should be balanced. The vegetables will tone down the taste. Throw in the pepper before turning off the heat. Related post/s: Where to buy sinigang packets in New York City

corner of 139th Street and Adam Clayton Powell Boulevard no phone number $25 for a whole rack of pork ribs ♥ ♥ Amidst the condo buildings going up as fast as you can say gentrification, there still remains the open drums on the streets used as makeshift grills to sell home-marinated barbecue in Harlem. The Dr. and I stopped by earlier this year when we saw the smoke coming out of a corner street shrouded in scaffolding. We still haven't figured out who runs the show, but as far as we know, a big black lady sitting down is the one who repeats everyone's orders to the more-able \"staff\" around her: an older lady who spoons the sides in a container, an older man who slices the ribs apart and another who mans the grill. She is also in charge of how much to charge her customers because no one really knows how much the food really is, especially when it comes to people who look like us. During our first visit, four ribs with a small tub of potato salad and two slices of white bread were $10; a second visit with an order of a whole rack without any sides, even bread, was $25. A third visit cost us $70 for two racks, four sides and a giant watermelon. We've caught the big lady giving the older man a look when they calculate our totals. The ribs are really, really good. They have a tangy taste to them-a North Carolina style using cider vinegar. The meat doesn't fall off the bones, but is tender enough to pull when you give it a bite. And in this rapidly changing neighborhood, very satisfying.

I saw these slimy suckers swimming in a large tub in Chinatown when the Dr. and I met up to buy groceries. Can we buy that? I asked. What are you going to do with it? The Dr. wanted to know, even though my asking does not really mean anything. I was already signaling to the lady behind the counter to get me one. It cost about $5.50 for one, cleaned, but head intact. Back at home, the eel was washed with salt and water because it was so slimy. We chopped it up in four pieces-a sharp knife was needed as the spine was pretty tough. The Dr. thought braising it in tomato paste would be ideal, but since I didn't have it available, we just coated it in salted flour. We threw it in hot oil with some chives and scallions and the snake-like critter made some good eatin'! The meat was tender, and no kidding, tasted just like chicken. Ingredients: 1 yellow eel, cleaned, chopped in 4 3 stalks of scallions, roughly chopped 2 stalks of chives, roughly chopped 1/4 cup of flour chili flakes lemon juice oil, salt, pepper 1. Combine flour, salt, pepper and chili in a small bowl. Coat the eel pieces evenly. 2. In a deep sauce pot, heat some oil and sauté the leeks and chives for 1 minute. Remove immediately to a paper towel-lined plate. 3. Then slowly drop the eel pieces. Fry until golden brown on all sides. Use tongs to make sure they are cooking evenly on both sides. Do not cover. Remove fried eel to the same plate when cooked. Related post/s: Deluxe Food Market has fresh eel Creeped out by eels? Try octopus!

corner of 145th Street and St. Nicholas 212/491.8323 $12 for two fish and chips, take-away ♥ Harlem is teeming with fish and chips stores, and living in the neighborhood has taught me that the longer the line outside, the better the food will be. (It doesn't work the same way downtown.) Case in point: Famous Fish Market on 145th Street and St. Nicholas. I got out of the A train and noticed the long line outside this hole in the wall even while the rain was pouring. I asked the lady what the line was for. Fish and chips, she said. I asked if it was any good, and there was no hesitation in her voice when she answered in the affirmative. I had no choice but to join the queue. When my turn came, I ordered the regular fish and chips. I tucked the brown paper bag under my arm and ran home in the rain to eat. I like the English fish and chips as much as the next person, but what's different with Harlem's version is that the fish is mostly, well, fish. There is no art involved in the making of the batter-it's just all fried fish! I like Devin's Fish and Chips a block away, but I think I've found a new place to stop by on my way home.

The Dr. requested seafood for dinner in exchange for his accompanying me to Roosevelt Island. While preparing for our meal, I entertained him with a smoked salmon appetizer. With a roasted branzino stuffed with lemon slices, I also served cockles in white wine sauce. Ingredients: 1 bag of cockles, cleaned and scraped off 1 cup dry white wine 2 shallots, chopped 2 cloves of garlic, minced a handful of flat parsley, chopped olive oil 1. In a large pot, heat some oil and sauté garlic and shallots. Add the cockles and toss until a majority of them open up. Shake the pot to be sure that all the cockles are getting equal heat. Add white wine and cover for about 3 minutes to let the wine simmer. 2. Drain the cockles into a large bowl, saving the liquid. Discard unopened cockles. Return the liquid to the pot and bring to a boil. Add chopped parsley. Pour this sauce over the cockles and serve immediately. Related post/s: How about some steamer clams?

It took a lot to convince the Dr. to take the tram to Roosevelt Island with me-like a homemade lunch and dinner kind of a promise-but he finally relented one hazy Saturday. From 59th Street and Second Avenue, we boarded the tram using our Unlimited Metrocards. The tram runs on a much slower schedule on weekends, but the ride took less than fifteen minutes. We stopped by the visitors' center to pick up a map to help us canvas the surroundings. From there, we walked south through the park and stopped in front of the Renwick Ruins, also known as the smallpox hospital constructed in 1856 when the epidemic was responsible for a lot of deaths in New York City. (James Renwick was its architect, the same architect responsible for St. Patrick's Cathedral in Manhattan.) Because of the highly contagious nature of the disease, the island setting was considered ideal. It was turned into a nursing school residence when they transferred the patients of the hospital to another location. Today it is the city's only landmarked ruin, covered in ivy, gated to keep trespassers off and lit at night. We passed the Strecker Lab next to the ruins. It served as the pathology building for the hospital. We continued our walk to the southern tip of the island where there was, surprisingly, a bed of daisies. The Manhattan skyline was hazy from there, so we turned back and walked towards the north where the view of Long Island City in Queens was more pleasant. A working hospital now stands behind the Roosevelt Island park where we saw a lot of patients on wheelchairs enjoying the view of the Manhattan skyline. The scene was a little eerie to me because, even though they have a nice view of the city, I felt that they were still isolated from the rest of the Big Apple. Residents who are more mobile live in some of the newly-built condos on the island. If not the tram, they take the F subway to get to Manhattan. An interesting tidbit: Roosevelt Island appears in F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby as Blackwells Island when Nick and Jay drive into Manhattan via the Queensboro Bridge.

What possessed you? the Dr. asked as he cleaned off his bowl of bibimbap. I've always done Korean kalbi at home but have never done bulgogi, so I guess it was just about time. I haven't had Korean food in a while and I was craving that sweet meat flavor. In Korean, bulgogi is \"fire meat\" because rib-eye or sirloin is traditionally grilled. Bibimbap is translated as \"mixed rice.\" A bibimbap bowl consists of warm white rice topped with sautéed vegetables, the bulgogi and a fried egg. Kochujang, a spicy Korean condiment made of fermented soy beans and chilis, is served with it. You mix everything together just before eating. The Dr. said my version tasted \"just like the real thing.\" I even think it looked like the real thing! I think I deserve some points. Ingredients: 1 small carrot, julienned 1 bunch spinach, thoroughly washed 4 shiitake mushrooms, dirt rubbed off using a dry paper towel 1 egg 1 tbsp sesame seeds, toasted 1 tbsp sesame oil Korean kochujang paste For the bulgogi: 1 pound rib-eye boneless beef steak, sliced in 1/4-inch thick pieces 1/2 cup soy sauce 1 Asian pear, grated with juices 2 tbsps finely chopped garlic 1 small white onion, roughly chopped 2 stalks scallions, roughly chopped 1 small knob ginger, peeled, grated 2 tbsps light brown sugar 1 tbsp honey 2 tbsps sesame seeds, toasted 2 tbsps sesame oil a pinch of ground red pepper black pepper 1. Whisk together all the bulgogi marinade ingredients in a large baking dish. Add the thinly sliced beef and turn to coat. Cover and refrigerate overnight. 2. When ready to prepare bibimbap, heat a stove top grill to high. Grill marinated beef for 1 to 2 minutes per side without overcrowding. Remove to a plate. 3. In the meantime, using a frying pan, heat some peanut oil and sauté spinach. Season with some salt. Remove to a plate. Using the same pan, add the mushrooms and sauté by adding in sesame oil. Remove to the same plate. Keeping the same frying pan, add a little more peanut oil and fry the egg over easy. Remove to the same plate. 4. To serve, put a serving of cooked rice in large slightly shallow bowl. Place bulgogi on top to one side. Cover the rest of the rice by adding the vegetables and mushrooms. Put egg on top. Sprinkle with sesame seeds. Serve with kochujang paste on the side. To eat, mix well. Related post/s: Korean kalbi is also as good Serve with Korean pickles, or kimchi

630 Bedford Road, Pocantico Hills 914/366.9600 $720 for three tasting menus, with wine pairing, with tip ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ Is there such a thing as too much? We arrived at Blue Hill Stone Barns just in time for our 5pm table where we were welcomed by fresh air and green grass. We sat in the lounge with our pickled ramps and cucumber martinis and black currant cosmo while they prepared the dining room. When we were seated, we met our waiter for the evening, Andrew, who happens to be from Brooklyn. He also introduced us to the sommelier, Thomas, after we decided that the farmer's feast tasting menu with the wine pairings was the way to go. We hoped to stay for less than four hours-we thought it would be enough time to eat, chill and take the 40-minute train ride home. So how did we end up staying until 11:30pm? And how did Andrew end up snipping fresh herb leaves for our tea while we sat out in the garden? Sometimes, you just accept things as they happen and try remember every detail the next day. As far as I can recall, we had a few amuse-bouche that featured the summer tomatoes and watermelon from the Blue Hill gardens. There was a tomato gazpacho we drank like a shot, with small tapioca bubbles that tickled our tongues. There were small balls of watermelon and cantaloupe sprinkled with black pepper that were so playful they reminded me of our night at Alinea in Chicago. There were the colorful tomato pulps that otherwise would have been discarded stuck vertically on pins held by a wooden block. There was feta cheese and watermelon granita served in small wine glasses-a sharp icicle-like texture and smoothie in our mouths. There were roasted heirloom tomatoes covered with goat cheese mixed with arugula. There was the watermelon sliced like a thick cracker, topped with crispy pancetta, currant tomatoes and goat cheese foam. It was a beautiful presentation using the simplest ingredients. Only several dips broke the watermelon-tomato parade: fresh ricotta with honey and black pepper, roasted eggplant, whipped lardo, arugula salt and carrot salt accompanied by Balthazar-baked bread. One of the main dishes I remember was the waxed beans with farm-fresh egg sprinkled with pistachios, a Blue Hill stand-by. The egg was encrusted in breadcrumbs which made it fun to break. I recalled the chickens running free as soon as our cab entered the Stone Barns property. I pretty much checked out after that: there was pork belly served with the chicken mushrooms they were parading earlier in the evening, and then there was apparently a lamb belly with peas-I couldn't tell the difference between the two after several glasses of wine. But I remembered the mock-risotto made of summer corn with tomato reduction. Andrew grated an embryonic egg as if it was aged cheese before we took our first taste. The desserts were, unfortunately, erased from my memory completely. I was told that there was a granita of some sort with some whipped cream, but a third one that involved cheesecake came with a lit candle. Andrew knew it was one our birthdays, but he couldn't let the rest of the table feel left out so we all had our own candlelit dessert. He could have stopped there, but he made us feel more special by inviting us to check the herb garden in the back. He snipped some of the mint and thyme leaves while we sat out in the garden. He made us some tea to end our evening. It was an expensive night, but one I will remember for a long time, even if some of the details escape me.

I was in my neighborhood African store ordering my usual halal lamb meat when these tomato-looking things caught my eye. I asked the lady if they were tomatoes. We call them chungu, she said, but couldn't help me with its American name. Do they taste like tomatoes? She couldn't answer that either, so she got off her seat behind the counter, walked to one of the shelves and picked up a can of eggplants. Like this, she said, pointing to the can. I asked how I can cook them and she just told me to make my usual stew and add them. I just bought some Thai eggplants from Chinatown to add to a tagine dish, so I was curious how different the African kind would be. I picked up a few to try out. When making my chicken tagine-the Dr. is a big fan and it's one of the dishes I've mastered in the last couple of years-I skipped the potatoes and added the two kinds of eggplants instead. I diced them only before I was ready to add them to the pot so that the flesh kept its natural white color. (If you use eggplants, whether they be the fat and bulbous American type or the long and skinny Japanese kind, you know that the spongy meat inside turns black if you have them sitting out for a few minutes.) The more familiar types are purple in color, aubergines as the French call them, but the African chungus I bought were green and had tight, shiny skins; the Thai type has a marbling pattern of green and white. It was an affordable vegetable to throw in a big pot of simmering meat, and turns out, tastes just like the other eggplants that come in different shapes and colors.

36 West 48th Street between Fifth and Sixth Avenues 212/398.2308 about $50 for two, with two drinks, with tip ♥ Wu Liang Ye was highly recommended to me by a Chinese friend. As we walked on 48th Street, past the OTB, the black garbage bags in front and the two crackheads on the steps, I could see why: there was nary a white person in sight and all the wait staff are older Chinese men in suits even though it was almost 90 degrees outside. I told one of the men in suits that I was there for a table for two. He asked me if I had a reservation. I looked around at the empty tables and said no. When I told him I will wait for the next table that opens up, he looked at me and ask, You really want to wait? He seated us in the back after five minutes. I was looking forward to eating Sichuan food. We had a long drive to a wedding in Rhode Island ahead of us and all I wanted was spicy Chinese food. After our Tsingtaos, we ordered our usual favorites: dan dan noodles and kung pao chicken. There was nothing extra special about them, but they are our staples whenever we get Sichuan food. I noticed, though, that Grand Sichuan makes a spicier version than Wu Liang Ye. The pork dumplings that were supposed to be spicy, too, were tolerable. We knew we were only sweating because of the restaurant's lack of air conditioning. We also ordered the bacon with leeks. They weren't kidding about the bacon. The leeks provided the crunch while the bacon was the king of salt in the dish. We couldn't finish it even though we wanted to.

I'm still in shock when I find that most of the ingredients I need for a certain recipe is already in our kitchen. That's the good thing with store-bought spices: you only have to buy them once in a while because you can store them for up to a year. For this one, all I had to do was buy the chicken, the yogurt and a couple of peaches. I used the blackberries I picked from North Fork after our trip to Montauk. They were in a Tupperware inside the fridge, but even after a few weeks, they were still good to go. All I really wanted was to use the blackberries before they went bad. I found this chutney recipe online and thought of matching it with pork chops because of the cherry chutney I made earlier this season. But then something Indian-spiced came to mind after I bought several lamb pieces from the Halal store around the corner. Ingredients: 8 chicken breasts and legs, skinned 1 cup of nonfat Greek yogurt 1 onion, chopped 2 tbsp cumin seeds, toasted, ground 2 tbsps paprika 2 tbsps garam masala 2 tbsps turmeric 2 tbsps cardamom, ground 2 tbsps cayenne pepper salt, pepper, oil For the peach-blackberry chutney: 1 cups of blackberries 2 peaches, peeled, seeded, diced 1/4 cup brown sugar 1/4 cup cider vinegar 1 onion, chopped 2 coves of garlic, minced 1 small knob of ginger, peeled, chopped 1 small jalapeño, seeded, chopped salt, oil 1. Make the marinade by mixing all the spices and yogurt together in a bowl large enough to fit all the chicken. Add the chicken pieces and make sure the marinade covers them all. Marinate for at least 2 hours in the fridge. 2. Make the peach-blackberry chutney. In a saucepan, heat some oil and sauté the onions and the garlic. Add the jalapeño and ginger and sauté a few minutes more. Add in the cinnamon, vinegar, brown sugar and peaches. Keep sautéing until the peaches are soft. Add blackberries. Cook, stirring occasionally and crushing the fruits with the back of a wooden spoon. Turn off the heat and let cool. Strain to a container and serve with tandoori chicken.

I received a packet of flor de sal, or flower salt, and a packet of sea salt from Terras de Sal in Portugal last week. What good timing, too, because I ran out sea salt and have been using the grocery store type the last two nights. The Terras de Sal sea salt looks and feels like a handful of rough diamonds. It tastes like they were just filtered from the ocean. The flor de sal is more fine, and because it is traditionally applied to food before serving, its saltiness is less strong. Terras de Sal mines its salt in Castro Marim, or Castle by the Sea, in the surrounding natural marshland of Reserva Natural do Sapal de Castro Marim. The area is a breeding ground for many species of birds and the salt mines are known to keep its surroundings balanced with the natural environment. All the salt they produce are mined by hand with the aid of wooden instruments and techniques used from a long time ago. When the package from Portugal came, I was very intrigued since I've never really distinguished the different kinds of salt available in fine stores today. I searched for a recipe that uses a large quantity of salt. I used a fish I've never heard of: croaker. They were among the newly delivered fresh fish in the Harlem supermarket one Saturday morning and were going for only $2.80 for a whole one. I read later that croakers live in shallow lagoons and therefore eat a lot of shellfish, so they're meat is considered to be pretty good even though a lot of fishermen think they are a nuisance. (Feel free to substitute with a sea bass.) When done, the Terras de Sal salt not only gave the fish some flavor, it also gave this dish a uniquely presentable look. Ingredients: 1 white croaker, cleaned and scaled 1 egg white, lightly beaten 1 lemon, sliced, plus some zest 2 sprigs of thyme 2 sprigs of rosemary 1 cup sea salt olive oil, pepper 1. Preheat oven to 425º. Meanwhile, sprinkle the inside of the fish with pepper and stuff with lemon slices. 2. Make the salt mixture. In a bowl, combine the thyme and rosemary with the sea salt, lemon zest and egg white. You can add a little water to get a coating consistency. It shouldn't be too crumbly. 3. Coat the fish. Spread some of the salt in a roasting pan and place the fish on top. Completely cover the fish with the rest of the salt mixture. Make sure the whole fish is concealed by the salt as this will seal it and keep all the aromas and flavors inside. 4. Bake the fish for about 35 minutes. When done, remove the fish from the oven and carefully crack the salt case using a heavy knife and remove the fish. Serve the fish with a drizzle of olive oil.

Hi! I've been reading your blog since pabulum, and I really like it, since i'm also addicted on cooking, tasting new flavours and (especially) travelling. I was very suprised (and pleased), when you talked about Flor de Sal, and Portugal, because I'm a Portuguese girl :). So, if you're interested in tasting / experimenting more portuguese products, please let me know (send me an e-mail), and I'll be very happy to help you, by sending them to you.

We wanted to go to Surfin' Tacos to cure our hangovers, but they were still preparing to open when we stopped by. When we saw the menu, we realized it wasn't a tacqueria per se, but more like a Chipotle type of place. Across the street, the line of high school and college-age kids outside Phil's Restaurant caught our eye. The origin of diners can be traced back to the 1850s when a Walter Scott from Providence supplemented his income by selling coffee and sandwiches at night from a horse-drawn wagon parked outside the Providence Journal newspaper office. There really wasn't a reason not to eat in one while I was already in the state. Well, okay, there is one: how awful you feel after eating a plate of three eggs, corned beef hash, white toast with butter and a plateful of potatoes. Although at the time very satisfying, I felt I was going to get a stomachache after. Big breakfasts from diners can be excellent, you just have to have the stomach for them. Phil's Restaurant is at 323 Main Street in Wakefield, Rhode Island. You won't miss the American flag. Just walk in and wait to be seated.

Jim's Dock was a good start to our quick weekend in Rhode Island. After a long morning drive, we were famished. We checked in at Blueberry Cove Inn to drop off our stuff and got back in the car to find food. We were near Narragansett and were surrounded by water, so seafood with a view of the Rhode Island Sound just seemed like the best choice. At Jim's Dock in East Matunuck, we were seated outside next to a pier where children jump off to get in the cold water. We watched as fishermen gathered their poles for the day. There were lobster buoys hanging off the walls and a variety of beach signs decorated the restaurant entrance. As we walked in and felt sand between our toes, I fell in-love again with summers in the east coast. When traveling to hot destinations, I try to stay away from deep-fried foods because I eat a lot of those at home. I'm also not a big fan of mayonnaise, so a lobster roll does not really excite me. I prefer eating raw seafood and cracking crabs while wearing a bib. In Rhode Island, I broke all my rules. We ordered the clam cakes, deep-fried batter you have to eat in order to find the small jewel of clam inside. I pulled mine apart to find them because even a Filipino girl can only eat so many fried bread. The Dr. ordered the lobster roll after hearing that Jim's has one of the best in Rhode Island. As much as I like decadence, I was a bit surprised that their lobster roll mostly had lobster meat and so little mayo. I'm not complaining because for $16, I got my money's worth, but we ate a lobster meat sandwich, not a lobster roll. Jim's Dock is at 109 Succotash Road, East Matunuck, Rhode Island. Just follow the path to the beach on your way to East Matunuck or call 401/783.2050.

541 East Lake Drive, Montauk, Long Island 631/668-4272 about $200 for five, with several drinks, without tip ♥ ♥ The weather in Montauk was tentative the entire weekend we were there. The sun came out during our breakfasts and then hide while we got ready for the beach, only to come out again when we walked on the sand. Luckily for us, it never rained during the day and we were able to sunbathe, get in the water and drink cold beers on the beach. When we walked in Inlet Seafood Restaurant, we were two people less in our group and another two were heading back to the city. It was a gray Sunday afternoon and the restaurant was pretty tame; people must have left Montauk early to beat the slow traffic. We were seated on the deck outside with a view of its namesake, a narrow strip of land jutting from where the boats were docked. The restaurant is owned by local fishermen who also work at the next door packing facility. From there, the catch is brought to Hunts Point in the Bronx and sold. For us who don't wake up before the sun rises, some of the goods are cooked at the restaurant. After I confirmed that there was at least one Asian person behind the sushi counter, I ordered the octopus sashimi with ponzu sauce with my ceviche wonton \"sandwich.\" I also ordered six pieces of sashimi from their daily catch selection: tuna, salmon and porgy. The fish wasn't sublime, but they were as fresh as any affordable sashimi pieces in Manhattan. My companions' meals were so much better. A cioppino was a bowl of happiness with white fish, clams, mussels and squid in a saffron broth flavored with a little spice. A grilled tomato bread was included for dipping. Another had a well-prepared roasted monkfish. The bowl of mussels with fresh herbs was also satisfying especially with an order of the extra bread. A Cajun-style fluke taco was served in the hard shell kind and disappointed my friend, but the burrito sure made up for it-it was the size of my arm served with chunky guacamole. A salad of beautiful heirloom tomatoes had the perfect summer touch of soft stalks and leaves. The weather may have been tentative, but there was nothing on the Inlet Seafood Restaurant menu that was.

From Montauk, we paid $10 to get the car onto a ferry to Shelter Island. From there, we paid another $10 to exit through North Fork and avoid the Hamptons traffic. We stopped by one of the farms on the side of the road to pick our own blackberries for $5 a pint. If you can get your hands on some fresh blackberries before summer ends, this is a great and easy recipe to end that perfect meal you've just whipped up for your friends. Cameron made it for us when we came over her apartment for dinner one night. The Dr. loves tarty desserts, so she easily won him over. Ingredients: 1 pint blackberries, washed white sugar 1 star anise lemon sorbet mint leaves 1. In a small pot, make simple syrup. Simmer some water with white sugar and star anise. I use about three cups of water with two cups of sugar, but feel free to make it sweeter if you like. Add blackberries and continue to simmer. Stir slowly and ocassionally to avoid burning. Remove the pot from the heat when blackberries are just a tad soft and bruised. Set aside to cool a bit. 2. To serve, scoop sorbet in a small bowl. Spoon over the warm simple syrup and a couple of the cooked blackberries. Garnish with mint leaves. Related post/s: If you have more time and more blackberries

40 Deforest Road, by the East Deck Motel parking lot, Montauk, Long Island no phone less than $10 for one, with a drink, without tip ♥ ♥ Do you have any money?, was all we heard from the guy inside the Ditch Witch wagon. I'm still not exactly sure why we thought that was funny, but at the time, we were eating our second meal of the day on the beach while locals and surfers alike walked up to the Ditch Witch to order. In that case, a young kid in board shorts came up and tried to buy something. He wasn't given his order until he answered in the affirmative. It was that kind of lackadaisical attitude that I liked about Ditch Witch and the Ditch Plains beach. The beach is an insider's spot-you need a town parking permit or a temporary beach sticker to park. It was a Monday afternoon, so it wasn't quite as busy as the weekend, but the vibe was more homey than listless. We ordered the cold sesame noodle salad served with greens and tomatoes. It was simple, with the right amount of peanut butter flavor; bright and light at the same time. The tomato avocado basil sandwich was mellow without the vinaigrette, but the pressed bread made it extra crispy and held the ingredients together quite nicely. The Ditch Witch also has different iced teas. The Ab's Brew, a black unsweetened tea with lemon was refreshing and not watery. If I have to wake up everyday near or on the beach, the Ditch Witch could easily start my day right.

I was in the backseat when we drove by Townline BBQ outside of East Hampton. I remember seeing the Grand Opening banners and thinking, I wonder what just opened there? The drivers in charge asked me where Townline BBQ was after I wrote down the address on our Long Island printout. We turned around and found out that the place that caught my eye was the barbeque place we were looking for. I knew then that I was meant to eat lunch at Townline BBQ before I head back to the city. There are rules at Townline BBQ: you order from the counter, pay and get a beeper; pick a table and wait for your beeper to vibrate. When it does, you pick up your order from the counter. Considering my last barbeque experience in Harlem was a bust, I thought Townline was organized and well-executed. It didn't stop with the service. Their Texas beef ribs were so good, I was using my hands not just to eat them, but also to pick from our tub of pickles and collard greens. I don't remember the last time I had beef ribs. Hill Country in Chelsea, which specializes in Texas-style barbeque, was out of them when I went during their first month. I also don't remember ever having barbeque with meat as tight and stuck to the bone as Townline's. I loved how dry it was; it didn't have to rely on any thick sauce, although the available ones on the table were good. I picked on leftover meat from the big bones until no cartilage was left and I was licking my fingers by the time our meal was over. This was our third meal of the day and it wasn't even 5pm. We ordered a pulled pork plate but instead got a pulled pork sandwich. Judging from the sandwich, I bet the plate was even better. The pork meat came in beautiful strings slathered with just enough red sauce and served on a toasted bun with pickles. The pickles were more sweet than sour, but complemented all the meat we were eating when the spicyness kicked in. The collard greens were good, too, with small cubes of pork included. They also didn't have root beer available when we visited, but a good selection of beers on tap (Julius Echter hefeweisen, toasted Blue Point) more than compensated for it. We went on a Monday afternoon and the place was empty. I can only imagine the crowd during the weekends when vacationing Hamptons folks crave their barbeque. You may be familiar with the Hamptons because of what you read in the celebrity papers, but Townline BBQ is a good indication that Long Island is sometimes where it's at.

This is my second contribution to Lasang Pinoy 20: Binalot, All-Wrapped Up! Binalot comes from balot, which means \"to wrap\", while isda is Tagalog for \"fish\". If you live in the Philippines, I'm sure you can go to your neighbor's backyard and find a banana tree. All you have to do is wipe the leaves down with a wet paper towel to make sure they're clean. Here in New York City, I bought mine frozen in Chinatown. I thawed the few rectangles I knew I was going to use. If you're surrounded by concrete buildings and there are no banana leaves around, you can use parchment paper which should be available in your baking goods supermarket aisle. If you can't find bluefish, you can use cod or even salmon. Using coconut milk is common in some parts of the Philippines. I grew up calling it gata. The important ingredient here is the dried chiles-the coconut milk needs to have some oomph! Ingredients: 1 bluefish, scaled and cleaned half a can of coconut milk 2 cloves of garlic, minced 1 small red onion, finely chopped a handful of basil leaves, chiffonade a few sprigs of cilantro, finely chopped a few sprigs of parsley, finely chopped dried chiles, crushed salt, pepper frozen banana leaves, thawed 1. Preheat oven to 375º. Season the fish inside out with salt and pepper. 2. Using a bowl, combine all the ingredients and whisk together to make marinade, except for the fish and banana leaves. Marinate the fish for about 30 minutes. 3. Lay banana leaves large enough to cover the fish on your working table. If they are already in squares, make sure you overlap two leaves for your \"base\". Put the fish on top and spoon the coconut mixture inside and outside the fish. Discard the rest. Using another banana leaf square, cover the fish and fold with the base to seal. Use toothpicks to hold the leaves together. 4. Put on a baking sheet and bake for about 12 minutes. Remove from the oven, discard the toothpicks and uncover by removing the top leaf. Return to the oven and cook for another 7 minutes. To serve, leave the fish on the banana leaf; just transfer to a plate. Related post/s: Where we got our bluefish Wrapping fish is fun!

This is first my contribution to Lasang Pinoy 20: Binalot, All-Wrapped Up! Binalot comes from balot, which means \"to wrap\", while isda is Tagalog for \"fish\". Simmering in tomatoes is referred to as pinangat, although in my family, it also meant sour broth. It was too hot for soup, so I decided to make this even more simple by wrapping the fish in parchment paper. I wanted something easy and quick, preferably using ingredients that didn't require me going to the supermarket. I found everything I needed in the fridge and the herbs I wanted on my windowsill. Under half an hour, we were eating dinner. Shortly after, we were ready for bed. In French, this is also known as poisson en papillote, or fish in paper. Ingredients: 1 bluefish, scaled and cleaned a handful of white mushrooms, roughly chopped 1 large tomato, roughly chopped 1 small red onion, finely chopped 2 sprigs of thyme 1 sprig of rosemary 1/4 stick of butter, half of it melted salt, pepper parchment paper 1. Preheat oven to 375º. Season the fish inside out with salt and pepper. 2. In a small pan, heat half of the butter. Sauté onions until translucent. Sauté tomatoes until mushy. Add mushrooms and cook until soft. Season with herbs and with salt and pepper. Turn off the heat and set aside. 3. Lay parchment paper large enough to cover the fish on your working table. Brush one side with melted butter. Spoon half of the sautéed tomato mixture onto the paper. Put the fish on top. Stuff remaining tomato mixture inside the fish and spoon the rest on top. Fold the parchment paper over and seal all sides. Put on a baking sheet and bake for about 12 minutes. Move to a large plate and unfold the sides of the paper in front of your guests.

This isn't really a recipe for the bluefish as much as it is for the spicy sauce that Koreans use to eat their sashimi with. The Dr. grew up fishing in Los Angeles and this is what his family does when they eat their catch. He replicated it in New York after he caught some bluefish off Sheepshead Bay in Brooklyn. Kochujang is a spicy Korean condiment made of fermented soy beans and chilis. It's the same red pepper paste used in making kimchi. You need sushi-grade or freshly-caught fish to make the sashimi. A Korean boy with knife skills is also important. A big plus is spicy arugula to wrap and pick up the sashimi with. Ingredients: freshly-caught bluefish or any sushi-grade fish, filleted and sliced in small pieces a dollop of Korean kochujang red pepper paste 1 tbsp sugar a few jigs of rice wine vinegar toasted sesame seeds salt a few leaves of spicy arugula 1. Combine and whisk all ingredients together in a bowl, except for the sashimi and the arugula. Season the mixture with some salt to taste. 2. On a serving plate, lay some arugula leaves and top with sashimi. Drizzle with the kochujang sauce and sprinkle with extra sesame seeds.

Lisa emailed to ask me where she can buy fregola pasta. I wondered why on earth an Italian would ask me that. It turns out that even her father didn't know what it was. She couldn't find it in her supermarket either. Fregola is a North African pasta used often today in Sardinia. It's made with semolina and then rubbed to form small pellets and then toasted. It's crumbly, almost like couscous. After I called Di Palo's and confirmed that they had the pasta in stock, I sent Lisa to pick up a box before they closed. I was intrigued that she needed the exact pasta, so I did some research and looked for a substitute. Orzo, and even couscous, were suggested. I have both at home but I decided to go for the orzo. My mother has plenty of grapefruit and oranges she uses as our coffee table centerpiece, so I ended up stealing a few to give the orzo a summery taste. The fennel was a bit of a surprise here-it gave a toasted smell and taste. You can make this meatier if you add some half-cooked peeled shrimps. Ingredients: 2 1/2 cups of orzo 1 orange zest of that same orange half of a pink grapefruit chicken broth 1 small red onion, thinly sliced 2 stalks of scallion, white parts only, chopped a handful fresh mint leaves, finely chopped a pinch of fennel seeds, lightly toasted, grounded salt, pepper, olive oil 1. Make orange oil for dressing. Soak the orange zest in some olive oil using a small bowl. Set aside. 2. In a pot, bring the chicken broth to boil. Add orzo pasta and cook until tender, about 7 minutes. Drain and remove to a baking sheet. Spread to a single layer to avoid sticking and clumping. 3. In the meantime, cut the skin off the orange and the grapefruit, and slice flesh into smaller pieces over a serving bowl to catch the juice. Add the onion, scallions and the orzo. Toss with the mint, fennel seeds, salt and pepper. Drizzle with orange oil before serving.

231 West 145th Street between Frederick Douglass and Adam Clayton Avenues 212/862.5335 about $31 for four people, with two sodas, without tip ♥ The day Oklahoma Smoke opened in west Harlem, they ran out of meat. I stopped by to check their menu and they told me they just didn't anticipate how many people were going to show up. Really? You knew it was your opening day, right? The next day, I stopped by at 2pm. They were open, but the guys in the front had to ask the kitchen what time they think they'll be ready. 5pm, someone said. Two days after that, I called to order dinner for pick-up. It was loud in the background but I managed to order a rack and a half of their pork jerky ribs. The guy on the phone said two side dishes come with my order, so I picked collard greens and rice and beans. He also reminded me that I can have a can of Coke with it. Half an hour later, I walked in to pick up my order. There were a few of us standing around and waiting for our orders. Once in a while, someone would announce a number. They finally stopped when they realized their customers don't know what the numbers mean. (Them: Who ordered number 23? Us: What the hell is number 23?) They packed up my order while I waited, but then realized someone had done it already. When I looked at that bag, the wrong sides were included. So I waited some more. When I received the sauce-stained paper with my food items checked off, the young girl at the counter didn't know what buttons to press to register my order. One of the older men had to help her. At this point, I'm not quite sure who's working for the restaurant. When I was finally handed my order, they told me they ran out of Cokes. I picked an orange soda instead. They gave me two. Back at home, I served the ribs to three others. I had to use my hands because the meat easily fell off the bones. I wasn't quite sure why they were called jerky; they tasted more like they were boiled before they were slow-cooked. Without the orange-colored sauce, the meat barely tasted like barbeque. Curiously, I texted Aaron, a friend who grew up in Oklahoma, and asked him what makes barbeque an Oklahoman barbeque? All I got in response was, We use a hillbillie recipe. Harlem is going through a lot of changes. Business owners need more practice in running a restaurant to please more than just their neighbors. At Oklahoma Smoke BBQ, they're trying really hard-at least they do their collard greens right. Related post/s: Another Harlem restaurant I'm holding out hope for

I lived in Oklahoma for 11 years, and the good BBQ tended to be dry-rubbed and smoked, with any sauce on the side....very much like Texas BBQ. Never seen anything like those ribs and orange sauce; sides were typically potato salad/beans/cole-slaw. *Definitely* no collards or dirty rice.

Okay, I thought it was just a problem I had with the customer service in this spot. They definitely don't know what they are doing in there. The pulled pork was tasty (well the sauce was) though a bit tough. Better than the other options in the area. Sherman's always smells so strongly of swine that I can never bring myself to order anything and the place is filthy yet their prices are high. Go figure! Not sure how they stay in business...must have a great deal on rent.

Another one to try is the stand on Adam Clayton around 135th Street. There's a big momma on the sidewalk who serves ribs cooked in an old drum in the summer. Expect to be charged double if you don't \"look like\" you're from the neighborhood.

It was my birthday and I was NYC for the occasion, I am originally from Oklahoma City so I decided to go to Oklahoma Smoke. The location was perfect; Just a few blocks away from the subway so finding it was easy. The smell when you walk in is delicious. My husband and I ordered the ribs while our friends got the chicken and smoked shrimp. The Chef was sweet enough to prepare a table for us and put some beautiful rose petals and a candle on one of their tables. Our sides came out first and were amazing. Next our meats came out so artfully arranged on the plate, it was gorgeous. But then the true test came, we ate. The meat on the chicken and the ribs was so tender that it fell off the bone. The Rub is mouth-watering and so is the BBQ sauce. You almost can’t believe you have only spent about $10 a person. The place is really busy but you don’t have to wait long. And ask to look at the chef’s picture album. I couldn’t ask for a better place to eat for my birthday.

I opened my eyes when the subway crossed the Brooklyn Bridge. The sky had that blue morning glow tint with the sun rising behind one of the old warehouse buildings. I wondered how many New Yorkers have not seen this sight. I checked my phone and saw that it was only 5:15am. We've been on the subway only since 4:50am and yet, we were already halfway towards Sheepshead Bay in Brooklyn. The Dr. had the weekend off and he really wanted to go fishing. The last time I met up with Sean and Jane in Staten Island, she mentioned that she wanted to go fishing for the first time. I told her about our last-minute trip on Friday night, and by 6:30am, the four of us were sitting together in the Brooklyn VI boat ready to fish for bluefish. We spent the next eight and a half hours on the boat dropping our sinkers and lures and reeling in. In between boat stops to look for the perfect spot to fish-we were following the sea gulls-we would go inside the boat and nap. We bought several beers and a hamburger from the kitchen when it was time to eat lunch. It was a beautiful day to fish. We had our sunblock on, but it wasn't too hot to be outside the boat waiting for the fish to bite. Once in a while, someone would scream that they got something and the deckhands will go around the boat announcing that there was one aboard. There was a lot of pep talk and rah-rahs to encourage all of us to keep fishing. Even though it was Jane's first time to fish, she caught four. The Dr. followed soon and contributed six. Sean had a few bites but none wanted to become dinner. I had one exciting moment, but I panicked that I probably helped the fish unhook itself. Before the day was over, we paid a dollar each for our fish to be cleaned. Everyone ahead of us just wanted their fish filetted. I was so horrified when I saw the deckhands dump the pail of fish heads and bones back in the ocean. These burly men have never heard of fumet! When our turn came, we asked only for our fish to be scaled and gutted out, head and bones intact. I didn't have beginners' luck like Jane, but I had an awesome time hanging out on someone's boat and thinking of our dinner prospects. You don't need a reservation to join the Brooklyn VI boat. Just take the Q subway to Sheepshead Bay, walk towards the water and go to Pier 6. The boat leaves every Saturday at 7am. In July, bluefish is in season, but you can also catch sea bass and porgies. It's $45 to get on the boat and an extra $5 to rent a rod. You keep all the fish you catch. Each fish is $1 to be cleaned.

I've wanted to visit the library on 42nd Street ever since the map room was renovated. I finally got a chance to stop by one Saturday. Past the security guard and to your right in Room 117 is the Lionel and Princess Firyal Map Division. The entire library is already quiet, but walking in the map room is a completely different experience. It doesn't feel stuffy inside even though the room holds some 400,000 maps and at least 16,000 atlases, books, periodicals and CDs about carthography. The New York City collection alone consists of maps from the 16th century. Maps cataloged after 1970 are all accessible via the library's online CATNYP. From a Henry Hope Reed book, I got the architectural details of the map room. The doorway is made of blue gray Fermosa marble from Germany while the perimeter of the floor is made of dark cream Hauteville with an inner band of Red Champlain 'Oriental Variety' from Vermont. The heavily-trafficked areas of the floor are made up of red Welsh quarry tiles. I have to admit that I didn't even notice the doorway and the floor until I started reading about the room's details because as soon as you walk in, the paneling strikes you. Eight patterns repeat in French walnut: satyrs, cherubs, lion heads, dog heads, birds, sphinxes, cornucopia and acanthus. The lowered plastered ceiling hides two east-west beams which allows for the six semi-domes around the edges of the map room. There are PL letters in gold on the domes for, what else, Public Library. The chandeliers are bronze with ornaments of acanthus, bayleaf wreaths with ribbons, bearded lions and carved scrollworks. There are shelves that hold a lot of books, but the long walnut tables dominate. The trestle tables are on pedestals decorated with the arms of the city of New York. The bases end in dolphin heads and rest on blocks of Verde Antique marble. Every little bit of detail is impressive. The librarian allowed me to take photographs as long as I kept my flash off. The New York Public Library is open everyday except Sunday from 11am to 6pm; Tuesdays and Wednesdays until 7:30pm. Related post/s: Map Room photos on Flickr

72-20 Roosevelt Avenue, Jackson Heights, Queens 718/779.1119 about $40 for two, with one beer, with tip ♥ I was armed only with a Post-It when I dragged the Dr. to Queens to try out some Newari dishes in Jackson Heights. Ubin gave me some recommendations and I scribbled them on said Post-It. We walked in before the busy dinner time and had to adjust to how dark it was inside. There was only a small family sitting in the restaurant, so we felt it was odd to be seated at the long table in the middle of the room. While waiting for our food to come, we found out why: all the bigger tables were reserved for bigger groups. The waitress wasn't kidding either. When we were finishing our meal, a band started to set up on the makeshift stage. All of a sudden, the restaurant was flooded by other Nepalis. In under ten minutes, almost every table was taken and the place filled with a language we couldn't understand and with faces distinctly unique. Ubin had given me a Nepalese recipe last year. Even though I spent several hours making chataamari at home, I still wanted to try and experience the other kinds of food he likes. Preferring that someone else cook them, I badgered him to send me to one the restaurants he frequents. At the Himalayan Yak, we started with the gyuma, or the Tibetan beef sausages. They looked like blood sausages, but they snapped like crispy hotdogs. The waitress brought out four kinds of condiments, among them an avocado sauce and a very spicy dip the Dr. couldn't stop eating even though it was \"annihilating\" his tongue. The chwela, a spicy Newari pork dish served cold, was boney but addicting. You put the knob of bone in your mouth and try to take apart the meat with your tongue, all while absorbing the peppery sauce. My favorite was the sukuti: Nepalese, jerky and perfect with a cold bottle of Taj Mahal. If I was eating it in Nepal, it would be prepared with buffalo meat. The spicy chicken was dry and hard to chew. It was the only thing we didn't finish. The popular momo, or steamed dumplings, were stuffed with cabbage and helped alleviate the spicyness of the other dishes. I tried to order rice. Well, I ordered \"whatever you guys eat with all of this\" and was served the tingmo, or steamed white buns. They looked like a wimpy, used towel on my plate. It was too bad that our dishes didn't have enough sauce because they would have soaked up any leftover juice from our plates. For my first restaurant experience with Tibetan and Newari dishes, Himalayan Yak was a good introduction. We walked out as soon as the band finished tuning their instruments. We almost regretted going too early and missing out on the real party. Related post/s: Nepalese chataamari recipe

Cameron calls the fruit guy on the corner of Spring and Sixth Avenue our porno fruit guy. He has signs that have adjectives on them like \"extra big size cherries\", \"beautiful nectarines\", \"sweet beautiful pineapple\" and my favorite, \"all kind sweet apple\". I've bought cherries and bananas from him before. Today I walked by and saw these green little things. I asked him what they were and he told me they were quenepas and that they are \"sweet and sawah.\" (I love this guy!) This Puerto Rican girl sitting on a stoop came up to tell me they are from Puerto Rico and showed me how to eat them: you take a small bite to crack the leathery green skin, suck the juice, peel off completely and pop the plum in your mouth. You basically suck it until it's dry. They are a little sweet and a little tart at the same time. After a few of them, you get a cotton-feel in your mouth because of the fuzzy texture of the fruit's flesh. They're known in the Caribbean as mamoncillo, or mamon, which is also an obscene word. (You're going to have to email me to find out what it means.) This Jamaican girl from work calls them ginep. She said they grow all-year round in Jamaica although this is the first time I've seen them in New York City. According to Caribbean folk wisdom, girls learn the art of kissing by eating the sweet flesh of this fruit. (More than just kissing, I bet.) In Ecuador, my friend Vanessa told me, you eat them with salt. I've saved some of the seeds to dry them and I'll be roasting them over the weekend. Tune in next week for the results! Update: So I put the dried seeds on a baking sheet and roasted them while I read The Times on Sunday morning. I remembered to take them out as soon as my mother asked about the funny smell in the kitchen. Thankfully, I didn't burn them completely. When they were cool enough to handle, I cracked a few using a nutcracker. The quenepa seed meat was surprisingly tender, just like chestnuts. They were a pretty good snack considering they were spat out by co-workers. Now I feel like I have to tell the fruit guy that the little fruits make good tender, nuts.

Very interesting report. I never dreamed the seeds contents were edible. I was searching online to try and find them (for purchasing) and ended up here. It's a childhood treat for me. I was born in Jamaica and later moved to Florida. Both (country/state) had guinep, but a year ago I moved to the Nordic country of Sweden, and as you can imagine I'm all lucked out when it comes to picking them up conveniently at the grocery store. Being Jamaican not even I knew about that story of the girls learning the 'art' of kissing with the fruit. That's certainly not what I was using them for. This and tamarind (which I've managed to find here, although not packaged in the best of ways) are my all time favorites. Guavas are great too... and jack fruit, breadfruit, tropical almonds, mangoes, June plum, sour and sweet sop, sugar cane, star apple, naseberry, maple apple, ackee ... I miss Jamaica! (I listed so many so that you could perhaps check them out yourself. The seed of the Jack fruit are excellent when boiled).

Yummy! Quenepas :) They are very popular in Puerto Rico on the street lights. They are available on summers and sometimes in early autumn. I had never seen anyone roast them or eat the seed. Gosh, mamones sure is a very ugly word.

208 East 58th Street between Second and Third Avenues 212/371.6060 about $60 for two, without drinks, with tip ♥ It was a new craving. It had to be Indian food but without the heavy curry sauce. It had to be seafood. Because I remember having such a seafood meal at Rasa the last time I was in London, it had to be cooked Keralan style. On the map, Kerala is on the Malabar coast of India. Historically, they have traded spices with all the merchants of the world. I had a difficult time finding Keralan cuisine in Manhattan, and because I had no means to head over to New Jersey the same night-where they say the good Keralan restaurants are-I ended up at Ada on the east side after finding one seafood dish that involved Kerala on the menu. The fish came in a thick orange sauce. I had to scrape it off to make sure there is fish under all of it. When I tasted the fish, it was bland. The lemon rice was more flavorful, so I ate an entire bowl to compensate. The goat sausages were better and disappeared easily with the mint-flavored nan. I'm not quite sure why Ada was empty on a Friday night. The hushed tone made us uncomfortable. The waiters hovered at the bar, perhaps itchy to close for the night. Back in 2001, William Grimes of The New York Times gave Ada two stars, so I was betting my Friday night on that one seafood Keralan dish. Unfortunately, times have changed since then. I'm off to New Jersey to find a better one.

150 West 10th Street off Waverly Place 212.929.0898 about $145 for one tasting menu and two extra dishes, with two drinks, with tip ♥ Where do you go on a first date? If you feel unsure about the other person, you may want to go to a small bistro where the fare would be safe and expected. If you've known the other person for a while and feel comfortable enough to eat with a very sharp knife, you may want to go to a steakhouse. If you want to be playful but still slightly impress, you might go to P*Ong. It's hard not to think about desserts as soon as you step inside P*Ong. The first whiff you catch is of a bakery's. From the red wall down to the glossy paper used for the menu, the Dr.'s first reaction when we sat down was, \"Are we eating precious little things?\" He was skeptical and he was hungry. I went over the short menu and bravely ordered the suite which consisted of ten savory dishes. They are adventurous, yet well thought out. No one lackadaisically combines the ingredients like chef Pichet Ong does at P*Ong. Who else would think of a stilton soufflé encrusted in crushed walnuts and then pair it with a basil-arugula ice cream? A fava bean and sugar snap pea dish sprinkled with thinly-sliced almonds and dusted with Parmiggiano reminded me of summers in Vermont. The sweet Maine crab with tarragon, lemon and chives was matched with green apple mousse, while the shrimp ceviche was flavored with Thai chili and mango purée. They were my two favorites even though I could have used more of the natural taste of the shellfish. Both were bright and cooling on the tongue. The bigeye tuna was overpowered by the olive dressing. I wanted to taste more of the fattiness of the tartare. The Wagyu carpaccio was biting with the arugula and the maldon salt gave it some extra texture. I barely had room for the goat cheese and the peaches served on a bed of smooth ricotta and brittled aloe vera. I was full and drowning in whimsical adjectives in my head. The Dr. selected two dishes a la carte after the kitchen allowed us to order only one tasting menu. He loved the smooth polenta covered in a generous serving of morel mushrooms. A foie-gras brulée started off beautifully and interestingly until the smell of burnt sugar reminded him of something else in the hospital. Unfortunate and unpleasing, I know, and not to be blamed on the kitchen, but this was when the watermelonade cocktail worked its magic. The Dr.'s skepticism dissipated as it got late and the house music was upped one level. P*Ong is certainly not the place you take your father to, but if your companion thinks stilton has some sexiness to it, you may just have to go out on a second date.

This recipe came from Bon Appétit Magazine. The original one uses creme fraiche, but I decided to skip it to make the nectarines stand out. Nectarines are bountiful in the summer and they don't really need any accompaniment-they're bright and juicy on their own-but the glaze makes for a prettier presentation. A dollop of good vanilla ice cream doesn't hurt, though. Ingredients: 3 firm but ripe nectarines, halved, pitted 1/4 cup honey a few jigs of balsamic vinegar 1/2 tsp vanilla extract 1. Heat stove-top grill while making the glaze. Whisk 1/2 cup honey, vinegar and vanilla in small bowl. Brush glaze on nectarines. 2. Grill nectarines until heated through, about 3 minutes. Gently turn over and grill the other side. Drizzle remaining glaze before serving.

The heat is on! There were some beautiful golden beets in Whole Foods the other day but I was too lazy to cook. This recipe doesn't require much work, but it does take an hour or two of your time to cook the beets. The good thing is you can just put them in the oven and leave the kitchen to avoid the heat. Cameron served this at her apartment when the Dr. and I came over with a dozen and a half of blue crabs. We covered her table with the Sunday Times and had a very nice summer night dinner. I made my own salad later and matched it with a pan-fried branzino. Ingredients: 1 bunch golden beets, tops trimmed, thoroughly washed 1 fennel bulb 1 tbsp cumin seeds lemon juice olive oil, salt, pepper 1. Wrap beets in foil and put on a baking sheet. Broil on high for about an hour and a half. When done, let completely cool. Gently peel off the skin using your hands. The skin should come off easily. Chop in small chunks. 2. While beets are cooking, slice fennel thinly and set aside in a bowl sprinkled with fresh lemon juice. The lemon juice will keep the fennel from turning dark. Cover with plastic wrap and store in the fridge until ready to assemble the salad. 3. Using a small pan, toast the cumin seeds. Ground using a mortar pestle. In a small bowl, whisk oil and some lemon juice with the grounded toasted cumin. Season with salt and pepper. Toss with the rest of the ingredients.

Searching For a Good Taco: Staten Island

***CONTENT
For non-New Yorkers, here's a quick lesson about my city. New York City is made up of five boroughs: The Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens, Manhattan and Staten Island. In my quest to eat more often outside of Manhattan, Staten Island is the least represented on this site. Although it has the most suburban feel in all of the five, it has been experiencing a large growth of Mexican immigrants in the last 12 years. The Mexican community-documented and undocumented-have contributed to the diversity of Staten Island, especially on the north shore. Staten Island has historically been known as the \"whitest\" borough in New York City, but now, almost 2% of its entire population is composed of Mexicans. According to the 2000 Census, Mexicans were the second largest foreign-born group in Staten Island. Besides more affordable housing, the mighty Verrazano-Narrows Bridge helps connect the borough to Brooklyn, Long Island and New Jersey, so a lot of contractors seek out workers there to fill jobs. I visited to seek out the best taco. I started this food project last year and it's gotten hot enough outside to warrant a continuation of my search, so I enlisted Staten Island locals Sean and Jane, and of course, Cameron's stomach, to help me find the best tacos in the neighborhood. I had a few stores in mind from a few Google searches, but we let them walk us to the neighborhoods where the Mexicans live and hang out to find the more authentic tacos. When available, we always bought the chorizo because it was the easiest to compare. I've had so many chorizo tacos in the last year and a half that I think I know a good one when I taste one. When the offal kinds were on the menu, though, I gravitated towards them since I didn't have a lot of them the last three times I went around Manhattan. My favorites were the longaniza and chorizo from La Conchita, the suadero from Tacos La Abuelita and the cabeza from Tulci-Mex. Here's the complete rundown: 1. Taqueria El Gallo Azteca, 75 Victory Blvd., 718/273.6404 We were famished when we arrived in Staten Island via the free ferry ride from downtown Manhattan. We walked past the Taco Bell and made our first stop in St. George. (Who is by the way, not a real saint, but someone who was treated like one because he bought all the land the community at the time needed.) Even though we knew we had to make room for a lot of tacos, we still ordered one apiece from El Gallo. With the semi-chewy bistek, the spicy and salty al pastor and two of the lengua, or tongue, we were off to a very good start. 2. El Campesino, 718/447.1215 The cecina taco was the best. Cecina is a traditional cut of beef in Mexico, sliced thin, salted, and then laid out to dry under the sun. It's like their version of jerky, really. We also had the lengua, the overdone bistek and of course, the chorizo. Everything was deliciously salty which is why I love simply-prepared tacos-they bring out the Filipino in me. 3. La Mixteca Poblana, 104 Victory Blvd. They only had the al pastor kind here which is skewered in a vertical rotisserie. Like any gyro store, it slowly spins while cooking. The meat is seasoned with adobo and sometimes pineapple or avocado. What I liked was their brown tomato sauce. It added a toastier taste to the tacos. 4. Tulci-Mex, 108 Victory Blvd., 718/720.1221 They had the most offal selection here, but no one spoke English so it was hard to get a translation. I ended up ordering the only ones familiar to me. The cabeza was a favorite, or the head, because the gelatinuous stuff melted in our mouths. We had the orejas, or the ears, which had some crunch to them. Oh, those little earlobe bones! 5. Las Jarochitos, Port Richmond, 718/876.9090 Finally, a barbacoa kind, or goat! Like any goat stew I've had, this one was stringy and gamey. Unfortunately, tiny sharp bones were included. They are really difficult to separate when you're stewing a goat for several hours and everything falls apart. The cecina and the chorizo were included in our order but they took a while. Thank goodness for cold Coronas. 6. La Conchita, 244 Port Richmond, 718/448.0154 In the Philippines, we use longaniza and chorizo interchangably, but both were available here. We didn't really care which was which because both were the best we've had all day even though at first look, all you can see was cilantro. They were crunchy and the tips were a little burnt, which made a lovely snack when Mexico scored a third goal against Paraguay. 7. Tacos La Abuelita, 229 Port Richmond, 718/273.4648 The tacos here were a dollar each but they had the \"especiales\" for $2 and $3. We didn't ask what made them special but the dollar ones tasted good enough. We ordered the buche, or the stomach, the cueritos, or pork skin, and the suadero, which is like stewed beef with all the fat included. The buche was a little unnerving to some of us because it obviously looked like chopped up intestine. The pork skin wasn't as cripsy as I would have liked, but the suadero reminded me of lechon paksiw without the sour taste. The best part of this trip to Staten Island? Ralph's ices after all those tacos! Related post/s: Background on finding the best taco in New York City project The Community Resource Exchange's report on Mexican Immigration in Staten Island

You have done us a great service for finding and reviewing these places in our neighborhood! Thanks so much, now we have to try them all. Although it's a restaurant more than strictly a taqueria, we really love El Mirador, Corson Ave just off Victory Blvd. I had their tacos al pastor last night. I usually have lengua or barbacoa, which are excellent. Their bistec is a little less exciting, and carnitas are pretty good. Thanks so much!

an \"off\"-al topic but I had a pair of tripe tacos at Taqueria Coatzingo in Jackson Heights, if you're interested in funky organ meat tacos. the tripe was deep-fried, tasted very funky, but quite good. one of mine had some graininess (I'd prefer not to think what that was). with a lot of lime and hot sauce, makes for a pretty damn funky taco. try it sometime.

I was in the mood for fish after eating too many tacos, so I stopped by the Whole Foods in the Time Warner Center to buy one. It was getting late on a Sunday. I didn't want to deal with the Fairway crowd and there was not enough time to go to Chinatown. I knew I had no choice but the expensive produce and the long lines in Whole Foods. Their stock was low that late in the day, but I managed to find a whole branzino. I like branzini-in plural form-because of their fleshy, flaky, white meat. They remind me of the Filipino bangus, or milkfish, without the perseverance requirement to pick on small fish bones. Branzino is essentially a Mediterranean sea bass, or to the French, loup de mer, and farm-raised. I also like that they come in smaller sizes than black sea bass or red snapper; perfect for one serving. I walked over to the vegetable section and found some nice bundles of asparagus. I've been eating them grilled lately-watch out, smelly pee!-since they are so easy to cook. If I didn't end up making a light sauce with them to go with the fish, I thought I'd use them as stuffing. Almost 15 minutes standing in the checkout line led me to go the easier route when I got home. Ingredients: 1 branzino, butterflied, deboned 4 pieces of asparagus, cut in short pieces 1 shallot, sliced thinly olive oil, salt, pepper 1. In a large wok, heat some olive oil. Sauté onions and asparagus until onions caramelize a bit and asparagus pieces are tender, about 10 minutes. Remove from wok and set aside. 2. Lay the butterflied branzino on a chopping board. Season the inside with salt and pepper. Scoop some of the asparagus-onion mixture and stuff the fish. Using kitchen twine, close the fish to keep the stuffing inside. You can either use a giant kitchen needle or just gently wrap the fish with the twine to hold the butterflied pieces close together. 3. Using the same wok, heat some more oil. Add the fish and cook one side until golden brown, about 8 minutes. Using a heat-resistant spatula, gently turn the fish over and cook the other side for another 5 minutes. Remove to a paper towel-lined plate. Related post/s: I also like frying farm-raised trouts Why does your pee smell after eating asparagus?

75 Washington Place between MacDougal and Sixth Avenue 212/539.1776 about $300 for two tasting menus and matching wine, with tip ♥ ♥ The Dr. assured me that he passed his two-day long board exams. He won't find out for sure for another three weeks, but I decided to prematurely congratulate him anyway. He's always been curious about Blue Hill Restaurant and I've wanted to make another visit after a flying roach dropped on my bread plate in the middle of eating my main course. Two years ago, I could have given Blue Hill a four-heart review, but the insect cost them the other half. I know that other people wouldn't even consider a return if they had the same experience I did. But the food is exceptionally good, inspired by local produce from the Hudson Valley and their own farm up in Stone Barns. I don't care what people call it-water bug or a super roach-any insect has no place on my plate unless the insect itself is the food. (Hello, memories from eating beetles in Ilocos Sur and chapulines in Oaxaca.) Why the two hearts again with this review? I'm smiling as I type this: our table was visited by yet another flying roach. I will take responsibility for the fact that I requested, like the last time, to be seated in the back garden instead of the main dining room. Before our tasting menu began, I was already a little wary that it will happen again. The Dr., in his usual composed manner, assured me that it won't. Sure enough, during our second course, the insect started buzzing around the room. This time, the other diners were also aware of it. It landed on the wall next to me. I stood up, trying to contain myself, and it flew away. Convinced that that was it, I sat back down to try and finish my fish. And then, plop! The insect was inside the Dr.'s wine glass. It fluttered for a second and it flew away again. It never came back, as if it was really just saying to me, Hello, nice to see you again. This time, the other diners saw what happened and complained to our waitress before we did. The Dr.'s wine was replaced and the rest of the night wiled away without incident. Oh, and the food? Still fresh and delicious, if you can take your mind off the roach story for a minute. We opted for the farmer's feast which included one appetizer, two main courses and two desserts. The bean salad was delightful, on a bed of purslane and sprinkled with pistachios, made warm with \"this morning's\" pullet egg. This was matched with a refreshing Plantagenet Riesling from Australia. A beautifully-done rouget was perfect with some Stone Barns greens tossed in arcuri garlic. Flawlessly-cooked fish just makes me so happy. Another white from Bruno Giacosa in Piedmont was its match. The Berkshire pork tasted a little like offal to me. Maybe because it was too fresh-if there is such a thing. I had to ask for a steak knife to slice through it. It wasn't tough in an overdone sense; it just didn't fall apart. The artichoke that was served with it was stuffed with zucchini and ricotta cheese, a quite lovely side I would want to eat again and again. A tempranillo and mazuelo blend was heftier, but kept the buzz in my head going. And mmm, the last two courses were our favorite types of desserts: a fromage blanc sorbet with fresh blueberries and a strawberry granita and sorbet with red and black raspberries. Both were sweetened with a Pineto from Brachetto d'Aqui. Blue Hill keeps their two hearts from me because I was still impressed with the food considering the circumstances. I will definitely come back a third time, but I'll make sure I'm far away from the garden. Related post/s: My first Kafka-esque episode at Blue Hill A Blue Hill recipe favorite

199 Prince Street between MacDougal and Sullivan 212/375.8275 $150 for three, with four drinks, with tip ♥ ♥ I'm pretty sure that when the poet Christina Rossetti wrote Goblin Market, she didn't imagine a restaurant team to be inspired by it. There was something tempting, almost lustful, about the magical fruits the goblin-men were selling. The weak suffered, but one girl stood her ground and kept the evil fruits at bay. The restaurant itself is less creepy than the poem, but the menu is quite persuasive. We started with a couple of glasses of Cava while we chatted over the menu. They were out of octopus and the charcuterie, so I picked the mahi-mahi ceviche to satisfy my seafood craving. The apple jalapeño vinaigrette had the right spike, and although creamier than the ceviche I'm used to, I could have ordered a larger plate of it. The watermelon panzanella didn't fare so well. The sun-dried tomato emulsion was interesting, but the taste too powerful for at least one of us. It was before July 4th and I was saving myself for the next day's barbeque fest, but the only seafood dish available was the salmon. A bed of peas, bibb lettuce and mushrooms in a delicate lemon-flavored sauce sounded delicious, if not risky, because how many times have I ordered salmon and it was overdone? My companion encouraged me to give the restaurant a chance. I was glad I did-the salmon was flaky and moist at the same time. The peas and the greens needed to be there; I couldn't help but scoop up some of the lemon sauce all over my plate. For the one who wanted nothing but meat, the Angus steak was perfectly done. There wasn't a trace of the potato purée on her plate when the waiter took everything away. It's rare when a restaurant in New York City has a lot to say but makes so little noise. Goblin Market was certainly in the news when it first opened, but it took me a while to actually visit and taste for myself. Thanks to tourists lining up for anything Mario Batali-they gave us a two-hour wait at Lupa-we walked over to the more quiet Sullivan Street without so much fanfare. I just wished I went sooner.

40 West 57th Street between Fifth and Sixth 212/757.3000 about $650 for omakase for six people, 60% comped, with drinks, with tip ♥ ♥ ♥ You know when people say it's all about who you know? I realized what that truly meant last week when I was invited to join a friend's family for a birthday dinner at Nobu 57. The birthday boy works in the omakase kitchen, so it was just appropriate that he took his family to work to celebrate. The Dr. and I were lucky enough to be included. We joined the celebration a few minutes late. The night was young and already, the restaurant was loud and buzzing with celebrities. Blistered peppers and grilled fava beans were on the table when we arrived. I rarely see fresh fava bean pods in the market, so I was thrilled to see them as appetizers. The kitchen continued to send plate after plate to our table for the next three hours. The celebrant was all too familiar with the dishes because they make at least 500 of the omakase orders a night from the time the restaurant opens for lunch until it closes around midnight. His friends in the back surprised him a few times with new specials. They started us with the yellowtail sashimi with jalapeño peppers and the fluke in ponzu sauce. Both were so light I was led to believe that the rest of the night was going to be manageable. But then the presentation began-the kitchen staff trying to impress one of their own. The tuna with spicy cucumbers was served in a martini glass and topped with microgreens. The lobster and shiitake mushroom salad, a popular Nobu dish, became one of my favorites. The lobster was so succulent. The mushrooms only highlighted its decadence. A tofu and mussel salad was more mellow, served in trendy foam made of miso. Although impressive, it was probably the least memorable. The rock shrimps were served with a spicy cream sauce. I could have done without the creaminess, but apparently, Scarlett Johansson loves them the way they were. The soft-shell crabs were lightly deep-fried and cooked to perfection. I loved them even more because they were served with small chunks of watermelon. Cubed fish was served next on lettuce leaves meant to be picked up with our hands. They were topped with fried phyllo dough that looked like dried noodles. We could have ended our meal there, but the food kept coming. The arctic char was delicately sweet, so grilled cauliflowers and puréed cilantro sauce were the perfect complements. At this point, I was unable to move, but I had to force myself to keep eating because the beautiful lamb chops came in. These lamb chops made up for all the bad lamb I've ever had in my life. Redemption is oh-so-sweet. I could have eaten a few more if only my stomach didn't beg for me to stop. I had no choice but watch as the rest of the table picked up the sushi pieces in front of me which included a salmon lookalike ocean trout and seawater eel. Thank goodness the drinks kept pouring. The beer and the wine flowed freely. Two carafes of cold sochu, one pomegranate, another lycheee flavored, disappeared immediately. We were too paralyzed to eat the desserts, but we happily picked on three kinds including the Nobu beer ice cream served with a white peach and jasmine soup and the whiskey milk ice cream with coffee crumble. One by one, the kitchen staff came out to greet the birthday boy. They brought with them a warm chocolate cake with green tea ice cream and a plate of fresh cantaloupe with a flickering birthday candle. I'm not as young as the celebrant, but I had no reason to complain as we achingly walked out of the restaurant to digest. Happy birthday indeed.

466 Hudson Street 212/741.6479 about $45 for three dishes, with two beers, with tip ♥ With four locations in the city, my favorite is the one on Hudson Street in the West Village. Petite Abeille is known for their mussels. On Wednesday nights, you can eat all the mussels you want for about $20 with a Stella. But I really like their waffles with fresh strawberries, topped with whipped cream and sprinkled with confectionary sugar. I order it whenever I visit one of their locations no matter what time of the day it is. When it's warm out, it's nice to sit by the sidewalk and watch the West Village crowd walk by. For lunch, there are several salads and sandwiches to choose from, but skip the spicy tuna sandwich and stick with the pot of mussels. Dip the crusty bread in the broth and you're set. Make sure you order a Leffe with it. Related post/s: Ditch Plains knows their mussels, too Or you can do it at home

Third floor of the Time Warner Center, 10 Columbus Circle 212/823.6123 about $75 for brunch for two, with mimosas and coffee, with tip ♥ Baby strollers of different sizes and colors almost blocked the entrance. One of the babies being held by its father burped and threw up a gooey substance on the floor. Where were we? We were standing outside Landmarc in the Time Warner Center on a Sunday afternoon. Thankfully, we were seated immediately at the bar which kept us away from any more cranky babies and parents with their hands full. We both stayed out late the night before, so we needed to start our day right. Mimosas were in order-about three glasses apiece, in fact, until the small champagne bottles were empty. I ordered the smoked salmon peppered with capers. I was craving a toasted plain bagel and cream cheese, which I rarely eat, so I was more than happy to eat something unexciting. The salmon was tasty, though, and even the Philadelphia cream cheese was good. Cameron chose the very filling eggs en meurette, poached eggs served with bacon, onions and mushrooms in reduced red wine sauce. The bacon was chunky and the crusty bread was softened by the sauce. It could have been a classic dinner option because it was so hearty. This stood out among the other breakfast selections. We also split the blueberry pancakes with warm maple syrup. I've had a lot of bad pancakes before and I have to say that the Landmarc pancakes were pretty good. Real blueberries peeked from the soft cakes at every slice with a fork. Even with our first two dishes, we didn't have a problem doing damage to them. We raved about the coffee. I had to call the restaurant two days later to ask for the source. The coffee is from La Colombe and roasted in Philadelphia. It is also served in restaurants like Daniel and Le Bernardin. It's $15 for a pound in the Chelsea Market, so I'll just visit this weekend for dinner and order it after my meal. Babies sleep early, right?

What to do with eight pounds of cherries? After our trip to Dutchess County, I wanted to use some of the cherries we picked from Barton Orchard in some kind of sauce. There's no avoiding using cherry preserve in this recipe-it helped make the fresh cherries a little more sweet than tart. The allspice and the cumin gave the chutney a really nice flavor. I added some chili flakes just to give it that small spike in taste. I think I'll make more chutney now with the summer fruits in the market. Ingredients: 6 pieces boneless pork chops 2 cups fresh cherries 3/4 cup of black cherry preserve 1 red onion, finely chopped 3 tbsp balsamic vinegar 1 tsp of ground allspice 1 tsp of ground cumin red pepper flakes salt, pepper, olive oil 1. Pit cherries. Using the flat side of a large knife, press on the cherry gently until it splits open while covering with your other hand so there isn't juice spitting all over the place. Pull out the pits. 2. Make cherry chutney. In a small bowl, mix cherry preserve, vinegar and allspice. Set aside 1/4 cup of mixture to glaze pork. Then in a saucepot, sauté onions until transparent. Add pitted cherries, red chili flakes and the rest of the cherry preserve mixture. Boil in medium-low heat until thick, stirring often. Season with salt. 3. While making the cherry chutney, sprinkle the pork with salt and pepper. On a hot grill, cook pork for about 8 minutes on each side. Brush the top part of the pork with some of the cherry glaze you set aside. Turn to cook the other side and glaze the other side as well. 4. Transfer to a plate and rest for about 10 minutes. Serve with the fresh cherry chutney. Related post/s: It's a bitch to clean, but I'm loving my Le Creuset square skillet grill I picked my own cherries from Barton Orchard in Dutchess County

Yes, yes, yes! I also was in the mood for a chutney type thingy. Two nights ago, I had been up all night grading essays written by my 170 high school English students. It was about 4:30 a. m. I thought to me self, Self, you got a nice homemade cranberry sauce (cranberries that have been made into a sort of chutney with turbinado sugar and some star anise) and those nice frozen pitted cherries that you got in the Russian deli on Broadway and 190th Street. So, I nuked the frozen pitted cherries for about two and half minutes in the microwave. Then, I mixed the slightly slushy mixture into the cranberry sauce. Mmmmmm. Dug in. Yummy. Oh no. Not. It turns out that when I had bought the cherries in the deli, I had accidentally bought not cherries but nice plump raw chicken hearts that were now half thawed raw chicken hearts mixed with cranberrry sauce. Oh. Oh. Oh. Still, I have not given up on fruit chutneys.

We woke up early on Saturday to catch the 9am Metro-North train from the Harlem stop up to Poughkeepsie. I bet it was a beautiful two-hour ride, but I was catching some Zs the whole ride up while the Dr. studied for his board exams next to me. In the Poughkeepsie station, we stepped out to board the Loop shuttle bus. The other six people with us all had tickets to give the bus driver-we didn't know we had to buy a package from the station clerk. It didn't matter, though, because two round-trip tickets cost us $52 which was the same price of two Farm Fresh Link weekend getaway packages. Our first stop was the Plankenhorn Dairy Farm, part of the Hudson Valley Fresh Cooperative. I've seen their labels around the city: Think Global, Eat Local. We were welcomed by the owners in their yard. They told us about the history of their dairy farm, their prized cow, Lizzie, and how happy their cows are. When we finally met the cows, I was surprised at how big they were. I guess the cows I see on pasture are not necessarily dairy cows. I thought dairy cows just had milk in them, you know? I had no clue they all have to give birth first before they can produce milk. All of Plankenhorn's cows are artificially inseminated by different bulls all over the country to make sure that they produce nice calves and good milk. They milk them twice a day, one in the morning and later in the afternoon, after a day of resting in the barn equipped with a giant fan and tire mattresses to keep the cows comfortable. My favorite part was, of course, tasting the farm's milk. The regular milk was thin and tasted so fresh, while the chocolate milk was thicker and tasted like melted chocolate ice cream. Both were good with the chocolate cookies the farmers passed around. Because they are part of a cooperative, they can't sell their milk at the farmers' market. But you can get Hudson Valley Fresh milk from Zabar's in the upper west side. Our next stop was the town of Millbrook for the farmers' market. I didn't want to carry fresh meats in my tote bag all day, so we left with only a jar of garlic pickles and an apple turnover. We walked to the main street and checked out one of the antique stores before we sat outside Slammin' Salmon to eat a hearty lunch of their \"garbage\" Angus beef burger and haddock fish and chips. We walked around the Millbrook park and playground before we got on the shuttle again for our last stop: Barton Orchard. The original plan was to stop at Secor Farm and pick our own strawberries. Apparently, the farm is running out of fresh strawberries because it's been popular the last few weekends. We were dropped off Barton Orchard instead to pick cherries. I've never seen cherry trees before, so I was amused to see real trees. I thought cherries hang from tall bushes the way blackberries grow. So I climbed one of the trees to reach the ripe cherries on top. After we filled two buckets, we went to the store to pay for our harvest. Our eight-pound yield cost us about $23. It was the perfect day to visit the farms upstate. We were so spent that we passed out on the train ride back home. Take advantage of the Dutchess County Farm Fresh Weekend Getaway with Metro-North: From Grand Central Terminal or the Harlem stop, take the Poughkeepsie train that will take you to the last stop by 10:57am. Buy the $25.75 Dutchess County package which includes the shuttle bus ticket or call 1-800-445-3131 to reserve a seat at least 48 hours ahead. Outside the Poughkeepsie train station, look for the bus labeled \"Dutchess County Farm Fresh Link\". There are three stops and the driver will stay with you until he has to drop you off the train station to catch your train back to New York City.

Corner of 14th Street and Eighth Avenue no phone number $10 for four tacos and a drink ♥ We had been drinking for several hours when the El Idolo truck caught my eye on the corner of 14th Street and Eighth Avenue. I convinced my tired and drunk friends to cross the street and eat one last meal before heading home. We ordered the chorizo, the el pastor and the chimichuria. I couldn't really tell the difference between the el pastor and the chimichuria, but the chorizo tacos were deliciously salty. The green hot sauce I poured all over them added a nice spicy kick. A cup of cold horchata, a Mexican rice milk drink flavored with cinnamon, almonds and vanilla also hit the spot. After spending a few dollars more than I can afford on drinks, the $2 tacos were bounty sent from Mexican heaven.

In the park on Bleecker and Hudson no phone number $13 for two hotdogs, one asparagus and a drink ♥ Right behind the playground on Hudson and Bleecker and steps away from the long lines outside Magnolia Bakery is a small hotdog stand with an expensive flair called the Dogmatic Gourmet Sausage System. The flair during our visit was a thin turkey sausage for $5 a piece made by Sullivan County's Violet Hills Farm. There are fancy sauces that you can add, from white truffle gruyere (yes, I know!) to dijon mustard and spicy ketchup. There is also grilled asparagus for the vegetarians. Everything comes in a toasted baguette. To push all the gourmet choices down, there are homemade ice-cold drinks like a really refreshing ginger with vanilla bean. The owner, Jeremy Spector, is also the chef at nearby Employees Only. (He was wearing his Employees Only T-shirt and chef pants when we stopped by.) After we ordered, we sat on the park bench next to his stand to wait. He walked over to bring us the wrong orders: he put spicy ketchup on our asparagus instead of the hotdog and he slathered the melted gruyere on another hotdog instead of the asparagus. We joked at how confused he was-it must have been the summer heat. We ended up eating two hotdogs and one order of the asparagus because of his mistake. He let us have the other hotdog for free. And, well, we thought he was really cute for being all flustered. Dogmatic Gourmet is a noble idea in the perfect neighborhood, but I'm not sure if I'm its customer. I found it hard spending $5 on a sausage. Related post/s: Sparky's on Lafayette is a little easier on the wallet

After a free 7-minute ferry ride from the Battery Park Marine Terminal, we were on Governor's Island. Back in the 1800s, Governors Island was used by the Coast Guard and the U.S. Army to protect the New York harbor. It became more popular after Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev met there for a 1988 summit meeting. Today, it's a New York City landmark where summer cultural and historical programs are held. Visitors can picnic and check out several historic buildings like Castle Williams and Fort Jay. As soon as the ferry docked, we walked along the National Monument Boundary and joined a few locals who brought their bicycles with them. The view of downtown Manhattan is as nice here as it is from the Brooklyn Bridge. The manicured lawn around Fort Jay was perfect for our picnic blanket and Sunday paper. How to get to Governors Island: Take the 1 subway to South Ferry. The Battery Park Maritime Terminal is next to the Staten Island Ferry Terminal. The first ferry ride from Manhattan is at 10am. The last one to leave Governors Island back to the city is at 5pm.

19 Old Fulton Street at Water, DUMBO, Brooklyn 718/858.4300 about $70 for two large pizzas for five, with drinks, with tip, cash only ♥ Still considered by a lot of people as one of the best places to eat pizza in New York, Grimaldi's has been welcoming tourists and locals alike at its location by the Brooklyn Bridge even before real estate agents gave DUMBO its name. The line stretches outside the restaurant but moves quickly. The volume inside rises when everyone's in a good mood, but you can still tell that Frank Sinatra's playing in the background. Grimaldi's pizza crust is thin and crisp. There are a lot of toppings to choose from for $2 each like black olives, sun-dried tomatoes, roasted red bell peppers and, of course, pepperoni and sausages. I especially like mine with basil leaves and garlic. My only complaint is that everything gets cold too quickly. By the time I eat my third slice, it's almost time to order another pie. Call ahead to pick up a whole pie-they don't sell by the slice and it's cash only-and sit by the pier while taking in the view of downtown Manhattan.

140 East 41st Street between Lexington and Third 212/682.3710 if we paid, about $150 for two, with two drinks, with tip ♥ I was invited by the Public House to a tasting this week. I don't usually hang out in the midtown area but I was curious to taste what bar food could mean to chef Robert Dziekonski, a native New Yorker who has cooked with Tom Valenti and Danny Meyer. A very large American flag drapes the wall near the bar and sets the tone for the rest of the space. Booths are for small groups, while a lounge off the side is available for bigger parties. I'd equate the interior to a steakhouse more than a pub. The clientele falls in that range as well: suits who come in for business meetings and for after-work drinks. There really isn't a good phrase to describe the Public House menu but \"bar food.\" And it's not the gastro-pub type either; it's straightforward, all-American bar food. I've been on a meat-eating binge lately so I was quite excited to eat some burgers and barbeque ribs. With a request to serve everything in smaller portions so I don't have to be wheeled out of the restaurant after eating, my companion and I started with the famous hot spinach and artichoke dip and grilled pita triangles. The Public House version was roasted in a baking dish with four kinds of cheeses. This made the top a little burnt and crispy. If the manager didn't push for it, I would have ignored it. Thank god for outspoken restaurant managers. The mussels were one of my favorites. Cooked with shallots and garlic but steamed in Brooklyn lager rather than wine, they also came with slivers of jalapeños which added a nice kick to them. I was good enough not to dip the bread in the broth lest I get too full too early. The scallops were a hit. They were perfectly seared and meaty, drizzled with vinaigrette of bacon and whole-grain mustard. Public House is probably not the first place I would go to for crab cakes and barbeque ribs. Their St. Louis ribs had great texture but I could have done without the sweet sauce on them. The crab cakes were more delicious without the avocado aioli which was too creamy and salty. They came with a good combination of watercress and caramelized onions, however. The other main courses fared better: our Angus burger didn't come with the bacon we ordered but the sautéed onions were excellent with it. I appreciated that English muffins were used which made the burger less heavy. The filet mignon sliders shouldn't be missed. The onion brioche were small, light and toasty and brought out the beefy taste of the medium-rare filet mignon. The onions and blue cheese were good touches. The fries that came with both dishes were addictingly crispy. The \"bar\" in bar food is supported by specially-concocted drinks like a martini with olives stuffed with blue cheese and a summery spiked lemonade. Decadent dessert choices included chocolate cake and cookie dough servings. We opted for the blueberry-peach crisp topped with vanilla ice cream instead of the espresso martini. They did end up wheeling me out of Public House after all.

29 Bedford Street corner of Downing 212/633.0202 about $100 for 5 people, with drinks, with tip ♥ ♥ It's appropriate that Landmarc's owners named Ditch Plains after the famous stretch of beach in Montauk, Long Island. While the Hamptons-style crowd mingles at Blue Ribbon and at Mas across the street, the laid-back type is inside the sleek and cozy Ditch Plains. They may look like they haven't changed their looks since graduating from college, but at least you know they're just there to eat a low-key meal. The menu is straightforward: mussels and oysters, burgers and mac and cheese. The choices are unexciting, but there is nothing plain about the taste. The burger was cooked after my own heart: chunks of bacon sandwiched with perfectly medium-rare meat and melted cheese. The mac and cheese was addictive with burnt cheese clinging to dear life against the ramekin. The mussels in wine with onions and parsley were perfect with a piece of toasted baguette. Ditch Plains gets crowded for dinner, but the service never falters. Our waitress brought us an appetizer portion of calamares to let us know she was taking care of us despite the wait.

I just had barbeque pork ribs the day before, bought from one of those metal drum-turned-grills uptown but my appetite was unsatiated. After a few drinks at Red Cat, we walked over to Sixth Avenue to the new Hill Country BBQ restaurant. The smell of smoked meat hit us as soon as we stepped foot in the warehouse space. Because New York City can't have open pits in its restaurants, Hill Country makes up for the decor: wooden tables, concrete floors and corded wooden logs in the back next to barbeque trophies. The finishing pits are behind the counter, though, and my mouth watered every time they opened it. The maitre d' gave us our meal tickets and explained the Texas way of eating: go up to the counter and pick what and how much you want to eat. Each meal ticket was marked by the staff. Our order was tallied at the end of our visit. Lose that meal ticket and you'll be charged $50. I ordered half a pound of the moist brisket and half a pound of the beef shoulder. At $18 a pound, the shoulder was the most expensive item on the menu when we visited. It was lean and juicy. Two out of my four companions liked it over everything else. Hill Country doesn't kid about how moist their brisket is. My share was almost all fat. They were also so salty that I didn't finish them. Beef ribs were disappointingly unavailable, so we settled for the pork ribs instead. They were smoked longer which made them drier, but they fell off the bone easier. The sausage, from the famous Kreuz Market in Lockhart, Texas, was tasty with a spicy kick to it. You can keep your bill at a minimum if you order by piece instead of by weight. One person in our party ordered two kinds of meat and both totaled $6 and change. The sides are the guaranteed culprits. They come in different sizes with the smallest starting at $4. Among my favorites were the red cabbage slaw and the potato salad. The black-eyed peas, or Texas \"caviar\", were undercooked and undersalted, but they ended up being a good side for my oversalted brisket. I loved the cold potato salad, as well as the green bean casserole. The sweet potato and the mac and cheese earned similar raves. There were several beer choices, from a Spaten to the ubiquitous Pabst, but I stuck with a good ol' Coke bottle and ice cold water with lemons. Because I didn't finish my brisket, I had room for dessert. The banana pudding wasn't as good as Buttercup's or Magnolia's but it was still a good choice to end our meal. We scored a free slice of the interesting ancho chili with dried cherries brownie and a cup of Texas' own Blue Bell vanilla ice cream from the cheery young man at the pies and pudding counter. I didn't tip too much because there wasn't any table service except to bring us water. Now I realize that I should have. I'll be back, though, to try the beef ribs and the game hen stuffed with a beer can. I'll make sure to tip extra, order by piece and skip the salty brisket at my next visit. And oh, bring my camera.

2104 Frederick Douglass Boulevard at 114th Street 212/222.3323 about $30 for two egg meals with iced coffee, with tip ♥ I'm always trying to support my neighborhood, so when the bus drove by Society after one of my bootcamp sessions in Central Park, I took note to visit. There were diners eating outside under large umbrellas marked with a certain beer brand. There were young black and white people hanging out. Some people may hate that condo buildings are sprouting up so fast in the neighborhood, pushing the original settlers out, but at least there are more options for places to eat. Society reminds me of a small cafe-restaurant somewhere in Brooklyn. The white-tiled open kitchen makes the place inviting. The two large wooden tables in the center are meant to be shared, while smaller tables, some with leather sofas, are perfect for couples. There is free wi-fi except on weekends when the brunch crowd comes in. Even though I first saw Society at night, it looked to me like a comfortable space for brunch. When I visited, it was so bright and cozy inside that I couldn't wait to get my iced coffee and my scrambled eggs. So I waited. And then I waited. We waited for a while before we got our iced coffees. We also waited for a long time before our eggs were served. The place was busy enough on a Sunday early afternoon, but the kitchen was swamped even with three servers on the floor. When my conquistador eggs came-what I would call their version of huevos rancheros-I was greatly disappointed. Scrambled eggs are scrambled eggs, but mine was missing oomph. The turkey sausages I ordered were the size of two pinkie fingers and looked like they came from the supermarket freezer. I opted for a salad and the greens were so limp, I set them aside. The house potatoes fared a little better, although they could have used some more spice. The cafe encourages diners to enjoy \"life in sips\". The staff is really friendly and they give off the right vibe. The crowd seems to be enjoying their time, too, but I wondered what they thought about their food. Society needs to take a look at egg in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, and learn what a civilized brunch needs. The neighborhood is definitely changing, but the question that still remains is how good Harlem restaurants should be in order for them to stay in business.

When Melissa Clark of The New York Times published this recipe, I read it over and over until I completely understood the process. I needed to make sure that making a crumb cake won't require a Kitchen Air mixer. I don't have one because I rarely bake, but the Dr. absolutely loves any type of dessert that has tart in it. The first time I ever baked with rhubarb, he ate every crisp. It's spring and rhubarb is out in the markets-I wanted that reaction from him again. What can I say? I aim to please. I made a mistake and left out 6 tablespoons of butter to make the cake. My version came out perfectly dense with the right amount of moisture and fluff, so I'm keeping the extra butter out from the recipe below. I started preparing at 9pm and the Dr. was eating his share by 11pm. At least he brought the vanilla ice cream with him. Ingredients: For the rhubarb filling: 6 stalks of rhubarb, trimmed, cut into 1/2-inch pieces 1/4 cup white sugar 1/2 tsp ground ginger 2 tsps cornstarch For the crumbs: 1 3/4 cups of flour 1/3 cup dark brown sugar 1/3 cup white sugar 1 tsp ground cinnamon 1/2 tsp ground ginger 1 stick of butter, melted in microwave for 30 seconds a pinch of salt For the cake: 1 cup flour 1/2 cup white sugar 1/3 cup sour cream 1 large egg 1 egg yolk 2 tsp vanilla extract 1/2 tsp baking soda 1/2 baking powder 1/4 tsp salt 1. Using some of the melted butter, grease an 8-inch square glass baking dish. Set aside. 2. Prepare the rhubarb filling. In a big glass bowl, toss the rhubarb with the sugar, ginger and cornstarch. Set aside. 3. Make crumbs. In another large glass bowl, whisk together brown and white sugars, spices, salt and melted butter until smooth. Stir in flour with a spatula. They should look like, well, crumbs. Set aside. 4. Preheat oven to 325º while preparing the cake. In another large glass bowl, stir together the sour cream, egg and egg yolk, with the vanilla. Mix in the flour, sugar, baking soda, baking powder and salt using a spatula. Keep folding until it has the consistency of batter. 5. Scoop about half of the cake batter into the greased baking dish, covering the bottom. Spoon rhubarb filling over batter. Then cover with the rest of the batter over the rhubarb. This layering doesn't have to be even. Using your fingers, scoop the crumbs and sprinkle on top of the rhubarb-filled cake batter. 6. Bake crumb cake until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean of batter, about 55 minutes. Remove from oven and let cool on table counter before serving with vanilla ice cream.

A month ago, my neighborhood supermarket had a lemon sale. I bought a wholeload but didn't really know what to do with a lot of them except to preserve them for a future chicken tagine dish. I was already pickling like a maniac, so why not? Ingredients: 4 whole lemons juice of 4 other lemons about 3 cups of salt 1. Make criss-cross slices on the two lemons without cutting through. Salt each lemon generously. 2. In a pickling jar, pack one lemon at the bottom. Then layer with salt. Pack the next lemon tightly and again, layer with salt. Do this for all four lemons and make sure all of them are surrounded with salt. Pour in lemon juice and cover tightly. 3. Store in the fridge for a month, flipping the jar over every week to ensure that all the lemons are submerged in the pickling juice.

Pearl Onion-Infused Martini

***CONTENT
From the Dr., I learned how to order and drink martinis. When we were at Applewood in Brooklyn last year, he ordered their pearl onion martini. The onion flavor was strong, but it made for a perfect drink after a stressful day at work. Any new obsession costs money, so I infused my own vodka a few months ago to save $16 per drink. Last night, I took the bottle out of the freezer and we finally made our own martini at home. There are several ways to make a martini. We like vodka-anything, so I recommend Kettle One vodka for this recipe. You can pick up dry Martini & Rossi vermouth from any liquor store. We also prefer our martini shaken instead of stirred. When you shake the vodka with ice cubes, some of the ice melts and adds a little water to your drink. This softens the bite of the alcohol. Of course, too much water will make the drink limp, so practice makes perfect. We also like our martinis dirty which only means including the olive brine in the drink. While James Bond may find errors in this recipe, we're quite happy with it. Ingredients: 1 bottle Kettle One vodka 1 small bag of pearl onions, peeled, some halved dry vermouth 1 jar of olives with brining juice ice cubes 1. Using a large pickling jar, combine the onions and the vodka. Let sit in room temperature. Save the original vodka bottle for later. 2. After a week and a half, strain the infused vodka back into the original bottle. Discard all the onions. Store in the freezer until ready to make your own martinis. For the martini: 1. While preparing martini, put ice cubes in cocktail glass with a splash of vermouth. Set aside to chill. 2. Using a martini shaker, combine ice cubes, two shots of the infused vodka and a shot of the olive brine. Shake well. 3. Discard ice cubes and vermouth from cocktail glasses. Strain contents of the mixer into the glasses. Garnish with a couple of olives.

108 East 4th Street between First and Second Avenues 212/228.4885 about $170 for two tasting menus with wine pairings, without tip ♥ ♥ ♥ It's almost unheard of in New York City to pay $45 for a six-course tasting menu. At Knife + Fork, chef and owner Damien Brassel pulls it off without sacrificing taste and creativity. When I called two weeks before we planned to eat there, they couldn't accommodate four people. So two of us went and insisted we sit at the bar. Apparently, they don't allow diners to sit at the bar unless the chef says it's okay. The waitress asked the chef, who was only three feet away from us, and relented. The space has a romantic feel to it: heavy wood and dim lighting. There are a couple of tables which can accommodate more than two diners, but most of the guests around us came in pairs. As our night wiled away, we realized why the bar is off-limits. Chef Brassel just doesn't want people in the way, lest it turns into a loud restaurant like Mercat. If I have to pick a word to describe the food at Knife + Fork, I would have to say \"thoughtful.\" Each dish served tasted like chef Brassel put a lot of work into testing to see if his inventive combinations would work out. Most of them do. I can imagine him working in the kitchen like a mad scientist replacing ingredients with whatever's in the market that day. Our first course was the salmon sashimi with pickled radish and seaweed salad. Salmon sashimi is salmon sashimi especially if it's fresh, but chef Brassel added a dollop of homemade wasabi creme fraiche to this dish. We all know how delightful and painful at the same time wasabi can be through your nostrils. Knife + Fork just happens to make it all delightful. This was paired with a Francois Crochet Sancerre, one of my favorite white wines, which was fresh and lightly fruity. In between courses, we picked on the dense and creamy homemade bread with salt and butter. I knew the bread was extra special after a man came in to buy a loaf before leaving again. The waitress told us that a lot of the people in the neighborhood stop by just to buy their bread. The second course was a small dish of frog's legs covered in sauce. The watermelon chunks and micro-greens were a good addition to them because the sauce was a little undersalted. I actually liked the wine more than the dish itself: a more citrusy and toastier Paul Cluver Chardonnay. The third course was barbequed eel with risotto and sun-dried tomato tapenade. It sounded better on print because I thought this dish needed a little bit more of a spike. Chardonnay's main contender, an Aligote, made the dish more interesting. I loved the firm skate with apples in Thai green curry as our fourth course. An \"Innocent\" Viognier from Shinas Estate was the perfect match for this spicy dish. I liked this dish so much I could have eaten one more serving. We were prepared for more seafood with our white wines, but then the lamb with the mashed black bean-licorice reduction was served as our fifth course with a glass of Burgundy. I thought the meat was a great way to end our meal. I didn't quite understand the black bean and licorice combination, but I was more than happy to ignore it for the medium-rare lamb. I'm not a big fan of port but it came with our last course of cheeses and honey. The port tasted a little bit like jam and was even more decadent with the spoonful of honey. Our experience so far was a gradual presentation of chef Brassel's cooking skills-this was the perfect end to it.

I don't really use a food processor because one of the things I love about cooking is the actual process of getting all the ingredients together and preparing them for the actual cooking. But for this Filipino pickles recipe, or achara, I was thankful that my mother owned one. I chopped the papaya and the carrots in smaller chunks and passed them through the machine to grate. Just make sure that you squeeze out excess water after grating them using a cheesecloth. The pickling juice should be the only liquid in your jar. To make this even more Filipino, I bought a small flower cookie cutter for the carrots. (Filipinos love playing with their food!) The red bell pepper and the onions were chopped by hand. I don't have exact measurements for the vinegar or the sugar. Start off with enough vinegar to cover the vegetables in the pot, but it's all up to you to balance the sweet and sour taste in the end. Season with a little bit of salt to taste. Heidiologies, this is for you. Ingredients: 1 green papaya, grated 2 medium carrots, some grated, some cut into flowers 1 red bell pepper, julienned a handful of pearl onions, peeled, sliced thinly half a head of garlic, minced 1 large knob of ginger, peeled, sliced thinly vinegar white sugar salt 1. Combine all the ingredients in a large pot and let simmer until carrots are soft, about 30 minutes. Turn off the heat and let cool before transferring to a jar.

I never thought I'd eat the best Reuben sandwich in Princeton, New Jersey. We drank until 4am during the reunion party, so we were naturally hungry after only a few hours' sleep. We stopped by Olives to look for breakfast but instead we salivated and bought a big lunch. A Reuben sandwich is made of grilled rye bread, corned beef, sauerkraut, Swiss cheese and Thousand Island dressing. It doesn't sound much-Thousand Island dressing? That's so 1980s!-but Olives made their version look so good that we had to order it for our first meal of the day. The bread was grilled with butter which made it even tastier. It remained crunchy and toasty until we had our last bite. The Swiss cheese melted as we split it in two. Melted cheese in a grilled sandwich always brings back pleasant high school cafeteria memories. The corned beef? Superb. I could only think of Wylie Dufresne's corned beef carpaccio as I devoured my half. The dolmades, or stuffed grape leaves, were also delicious, especially with the orzo with grilled vegetables and pine nuts. I wasn't exactly in the mood for Mediterranean food, but then again, I also wasn't aware I could find a satisfying meal in Princeton, New Jersey. Sometimes, life is full of nice surprises. Olive's Deli & Bakery is at 22 Witherspoon Street in Princeton, New Jersey. There are no tables inside, but you can call 609/921.1569 and order ahead for pick-up.

Tony tore a page off his psychiatrist's copy of Departures magazine before he got kicked out of her office. The page had a steak recipe on it. And after the bloodbath in The Sopranos last night, I could only think of eating a thick rib-eye steak for dinner. After an hour of push-ups, lunges and sprints in Central Park, I walked to the Fairway supermarket to pick up a $26 rib-eye steak. I will never know what recipe Tony wanted to replicate, but maybe Carmela will put these red onion pickles on the side. Ingredients: 1 pound rib-eye steak, excess fat trimmed 2 cloves of garlic, minced olive oil, salt, pepper For the red onion pickles: 2 large red onions, peeled, sliced into thin rounds, separated into rings 1 bunch of red beets 1 cup red wine vinegar 1/2 cup sugar salt 1. Pickle the red onions ahead of time. In a saucepan, cook the beets in boiling water until tender, about 30 minutes. When the beets are cooked, remove from the pan. Save 1/2 cup of the beet juice in a large bowl. In this bowl, combine the red wine vinegar, sugar, salt and 1 cup of water. Add the onions to the bowl and make sure they are completely submerged in the pickling liquid. Cover and refrigerate for at least 24 hours. 2. Rub salt and pepper all over the steak. Drizzle with some olive oil. Using a knife, make several slits on one side of the steak and insert garlic pieces. Set aside until ready to cook. 3. Heat an oven-proof frying pan. When the pan is hot enough but not smoking, sear one side of the steak for about 8 minutes. Slowly lift with a pair of tongs and turn over to cook the other side for another 6 minutes. Transfer the pan to the oven and broil on high for another 5 minutes or until medium-rare. 4. Remove the steak to a chopping board and let rest for 10 minutes. Slice against the grain when ready to serve. Top with red onion pickles. Related post/s: Serve the red onion pickles with skirt steak, too For color, serve with salsa verde

I love endives in the spring. It may feel like summer in New York City, but the spring vegetables are still available in the market. When I'm in the mood for beef, I can't help but serve a medium-rare steak with grilled vegetables. It's too hot to be using the oven for longer than ten minutes so adding them to the same pan your steak is grilling is just perfect. If you are without an outdoor garden like me, use a dependable Le Creuset frying pan to get the handsome grill marks. Ingredients: 1 pound skirt steak, excess fat trimmed 4 Belgian endives, quartered lengthwise 3 sprigs of rosemary 3 sprigs of thyme half a bunch of parsley, finely chopped 4 garlic cloves, minced olive oil, salt, pepper 1. In a large baking dish, combine all the ingredients except for the steak and the endives. Place the steak in the dish and turn to coat both sides with the herb mixture. Cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or overnight. 2. When ready to cook, heat an oven-proof frying pan. When the pan is hot enough but not smoking, sear one side of the steak for about 8 minutes. Slowly lift with a pair of tongs and turn over to cook the other side for another 8 minutes. Save the marinade. 3. While the other side cooks, brush the endives with the remaining marinade and place on the same pan. Turn when one side is charred enough. 4. Remove the steak to a chopping board and let rest for about 5 minutes. Slice the steak on the bias about 1/2-inch thick and divide slices among serving plates. Serve with the endives.

All the herbs in this salsa verde, or green sauce, recipe is available in the spring and early summer. Wash them thoroughly and you can make almost two cups. I put mine in a small glass jar my father picked up from Ikea and stored it in the fridge for up to a week. It's a great side with steak. Ingredients: 1 bunch of flat-leaf parsley, leaves only, washed 1 bunch of mint leaves 1 bunch of basil leaves 1/2 cup of capers, drained and rinsed 2 salt-packed anchovy fillets 1 tbsp Dijon mustard 1 tsp sugar 2 garlic cloves, sliced thinly 1 tbsp red pepper flakes olive oil, salt, pepper 1. In the bowl of a food processor, combine everything except the oil, salt and pepper. Pulse to form a coarse puree. While the motor is running, drizzle in the olive oil to form a smoother puree. Season with salt and pepper.

I've never seen lightning like that before; never seen them flash one right after the other. For a moment, I wondered where I was. Was this really New Jersey? Cameron and I walked across her alma matter's campus and ended up at Teresa's for dinner. We were famished and wet from the downpour. We just wanted to sit so we could eat and drink at the same time. There was already a group waiting for a table with their wet umbrellas. We stood for less than ten minutes to be seated at the bar but it felt longer because the maitre d' let another couple behind us sit first. We kept our New York cool and didn't make a scene until another couple tried to do the same thing. It was time for some dirty martinis. We started with the fennel and arugula salad with shaved black peppercorn cheese. I often make this salad at home but I can never seem to say no whenever I see it on the menu. It's so simple and satisfying. The meat and cheese plate consisted of some prosciutto and soppresatta, plus small wedges of hard and semi-soft cheeses. It took a while for us to finish both plates because we were chatting, but as soon as we cleared our plates, our pasta dishes were served. We knew one bowl would have been enough for both of us but we always end up ordering more than we can eat whenever we're together. We ordered the linguine with mussels, Manila clams and scallops. We also ordered the ricotta and Berskhire sausage-filled cannelloni. The former was better than the latter. The pasta had a clam juice taste and gave the dish a little bit more oomph. The cannelloni was just so-so even with the tasty sausages in it. It was more substantial with all the ricotta. I've never been a big fan of a big bowl of pasta with red sauce anyway. Since we were sitting at the bar, we didn't really get exceptional service. We interacted with our young female bartender twice: as soon as we sat down and when she asked me if I wanted another martini. (I said yes.) Our bill was about $80 without the tip after three cocktails, two appetizers and two pasta dishes. It was substantially less expensive than any complete meal we've paid for in the city. The rain was all worth it considering we just wanted a simple meal. Teresa's Cafe Italiano is at 23 Palmer Square East in Princeton, New Jersey. No reservations needed but their number is 609/921.1974. Related post/s: Olives was a very good lunch option

Ginger-Mint Chicken with Mizuna and Arugula Salad

I walked to my desk this morning and a box was waiting. Anna sent me my annual supply of greens from her garden. There were two Ziploc-fulls of arugula and of Japanese mizuna. There was also a bunch of ginger-mint leaves. Chives and Texas tarragon were also included. They were an absolutely nice surprise to start my day. I was famished after my third session of bootcamp in Central Park. When I got home, I wanted to make and eat something quick but filling at the same time. This recipe may look long, but if you have an Asian family pantry, I bet you already have most of the ingredients listed here. Of course, if you don't have someone in Chicago sending you fresh ginger-mint leaves from her garden, feel free to substitute with regular mint leaves and a knob of peeled and grated fresh ginger. If you can't find mizuna, try baby spinach, chicory or mustard greens-it's important that your greens are bitter and spicy at the same time because the chicken is a tad sweet with the brown sugar. As for the corn, I added them at the last second because I found them cooked in the fridge. Using a serrated knife, I cut the kernels off the cob. You can use raw or canned corn kernels, too. The fried onions were a nice touch, but again, if you're feeling lazy, just sauté them with the chicken. When everything was done, Anna's fresh greens made this dish even more nourishing. An hour-long of lunges, crab-crawls and push-ups weren't so bad after all. Ingredients: 4 boneless chicken thighs, cut in small pieces 2 portobello mushrooms, cleaned, cut in small pieces 1 cup corn kernels a handful of baby carrots, halved fresh ginger-mint leaves 1 small jalapeño pepper, seeded and chopped 3 garlic cloves, minced 2 tbsps brown sugar 2 tbsps fish sauce 2 tbsps rice vinegar olive oil For the fried onions: 1 larged red onion, sliced thinly, rings separated 1/4 cup of flour peanut oil For the salad: a handful of Japanese mizuna greens, torn a handful of arugula, torn juice from half a lemon 1 tbsp red hot sauce 2 tbsps soy sauce 3 cloves of garlic, minced olive oil, salt, pepper 1. Make the fried onions. In a large bowl, toss the onions in the flour to coat. Using a skillet, heat some peanut oil and fry the onions in small batches without overlapping. When golden brown on both sides, remove with a slotted spoon to a plate lined with paper towel. Set aside. 2. In another small bowl, combine brown sugar, fish sauce and vinegar. Stir until sugar is dissolved. 3. Heat a large wok over high heat. Add some oil and stir-fry the chicken for about 10 minutes with the carrots. Add mushrooms, corn, pepper and garlic. Add the fish sauce mixture. Stir in the fried onions and the ginger-mint leaves. Turn off the heat and make your salad. 4. In a salad bowl, combine the lemon juice with the soy sauce and olive oil. Stir in the garlic and the hot sauce and season with salt and pepper. Toss in the greens. Serve with the ginger-mint chicken.

This recipe was adapted from one of my favorite cookbooks, The Babbo Cookbook, from one of my favorite chefs, Mario Batali. He used bavette, a thin, ribbon-shaped pasta, but I substituted spaghetti instead because it was all I had handy. He also used jalapeño pesto, but I doubled the amount of red chili flakes from what I would normally add to give it that kick without the hard work. I did make my own basic tomato sauce though, because, well, I usually do. If you can't find fresh baby octopuses, you can certainly used the frozen ones. Those are already cleaned. If you buy the fresh ones, all you have to do to clean them is to turn the head inside out and wash the entrails. Then pull out the eyes and remove the mouth which is found at the center of the octopus where the tentacles meet the head and body. It's as easy as cleaning fresh squid. If you can only find large octopus, cook that longer until it's tender and just slice it in smaller pieces before tossing with the pasta. Ingredients: 2 pounds of baby octopuses, cleaned, washed, drained 1 bundle of spaghetti 2 cups basic tomato sauce 12 fresh mint leaves 3 tbsps red wine vinegar 4 garlic cloves, thinly sliced red chili flakes olive oil, salt, pepper 1. Using a large pot, cook pasta al dente in boiling salted water for about 8 minutes. Remove and drain. Set aside. You will cook the pasta more later. 2. While cooking the pasta, cook the octopuses. In a large saucepot, combine octopuses with the red wine vinegar and just enough water to cover. Cook uncovered and immediately remove from heat as soon as the octopuses change color. Drain and set aside to let cool. 3. In a large skillet, heat some olive oil. Sauté the garlic until golden brown. Add the tomato sauce and chili flakes and simmer uncovered for about 5 minutes. Add the octopuses and the pasta. Toss over high heat for about a minute with the mint leaves. Season with salt and pepper.

I'm making this recipe right now... one question arose; it sais to take the octopuses of the heat when they change color, ca. how long does this take? I put mine up with the vinegar and cold water to cover (only 3 octopi not even a pound) and put it on the stove, it was probably not more than a couple of minutes till they turned mostly white... long enough or did I just screw up my dinner... thanks

It doesn't take more than 5 minutes to cook octopus or squid, any longer and you got something rubbery. I hope it worked out.

I first served this roasted duck and plum salad from delicious. Magazine last summer when I invited about ten people from work over for dinner. I prepared several dishes to accommodate even the vegetarians, but this one was my favorite. It's even easier if you just buy the roasted duck from Chinatown. This is a great salad to celebrate the beginning of the summer because plums are readily available in the market. In New York City's Chinatown, a pound of bean sprouts cost 50 cents. You can get plum sauce from the Asian aisle in your grocery store. I've used two small packets of Chinese takeout duck sauce as an alternative, too. Another time, I found a jar of orange marmalade in our fridge and used two tablespoons of it instead. Ingredients: half of a roasted duck, chopped into small pieces 6 plums, halved and seeds removed a handful of bean sprouts 2 star anise 1 cinnamon stick 1/3 cup white sugar 2 garlic cloves, finely chopped 1 small red chili, finely chopped 2 tbsps plum sauce 1 tbsp lime juice a handful of basil leaves a handful of cilantro salt, pepper 1. Preheat oven to 350º. Place plums, anise, cinammon and sugar in a baking dish with 1/4 cup of water. Cover with foil and roast for 35 minutes until plums are soft. Remove from the oven, drain and save the juice. Set the plums aside to cool. When plums are cool enough, peel and slice into smaller halves. 2. In a small bowl, make the dressing. Combine the plum juice with the garlic, chili, plum sauce and lime juice. Season with salt and pepper. 3. Using your hands, shred the duck meat off the bones. Combine the duck and the peeled plums in a large salad. Toss with sprouts, basil, cilantro and sprinkle with the dressing.

64-13 39th Avenue between 64th and 65th Streets, Woodside, Queens 718/899.9599 about $45, without drinks, with tip ♥ ♥ Sripraphai is the kind of restaurant you have to visit again in order to really get a good feel for its Thai cuisine. Dining with a large group would help because sharing is encouraged in order for you to taste more than two dishes. Because it was just me and the Dr., we could only order three. Out of those three, only one was solid. The mango salad with crispy dried catfish to me was what makes Thai cuisine good. It was salty, hot, sour and sweet all the same time. The red onions, cilantro and chili peppers woke my taste buds up. It reminded me of the Filipino daing, only saltier and spicier, and perfect with a cold bottle of beer. The dishes over rice were safe and less flavorful. I should have known better when I read that the pork came with \"special house sauce.\" The Dr.'s duck was a little bit better with the small, round eggplants I rarely see in any other dishes I eat in New York City. It also reminded me of the Filipino pakbet. Both came with a generous plateful of rice we couldn't finish. We didn't have enough room for dessert, but we swore we'll be back to order the other specials on the menu. Next time, we'll skip the rice dishes and bring an army of friends with us.

78 Rivington Street on Allen 212/529.3901 about $50, without drinks, with tip ♥ It was a balmy, summer evening. We thought ordering a bowl of noodles was just appropriate. Upon entering Kampuchea Noodle Bar, I surely felt like being in Asia. It was hot and humid, but a faint breeze coming from the outside made everything comfortable inside. The restaurant details, from the glass mugs to the dim lights, romanticize everything on the menu. That's a good thing because the food can't hold its own. We started with the crisp pork belly. They were a little sweet for my taste, but it's hard for me to turn down fried fat. It reminded me of Fatty Crab's better-executed version, served with chunks of watermelon. The pickle plate was very spicy but addicting at the same time. It made me wonder if there was a Korean back in the kitchen. My bowl of vermicelli was good enough to satisfy an Asian taste craving I was having, but the Dr. hated his bowl of duck soup because it was too oily. We both felt that the noodles needed some more love because their consistency felt like they were prepared carelessly. The wooden communal tables and the mostly beautiful diners reminded me of Momofuku but with a sexier address. In terms of food, however, Momofuku it wasn't.

646 West 131st Street and Twelfth Avenue 212/694.1777 about $60 for two racks and eight sides, without drinks, without tip ♥ ♥ Update: Dinosaur Bar-B-Que is moving to 125th and Twelfth Avenue after Columbia University takes over People have been talking about Dinosaur Bar-B-Que since it opened in 2004. I just didn't have a clue about how many people. Jase and Mia came down from Brooklyn to eat barbeque with the Dr. and me one weekend. I was surprised that only a 9pm table was available for four people but I was flabbergasted when the restaurant was crowded. Sure, it was basketball night, but this is uptown and way above 14th Street. Where did everyone come from? I felt guilty that I was the last one to make an effort to visit. And I live about fifteen blocks away! When we were finally seated and the the live band started playing in the other side of the room, we ate our fried green tomatoes. We also ordered two of the Sweetheart plates: a full rack of pork ribs plus four sides. Soon enough, our table was covered with macaroni and cheese, French fries, coleslaw and cornbread. Mia is almost vegan, but she politely watched the three of us devour our meat while she ate her iceberg lettuce with blue cheese dressing. (I told Jase that she was a keeper after he finished one of the racks all by himself without her glaring.) I've gone through lengths to eat a good barbeque. I once spent $70 for a round-trip cab ride from the Houston airport to find Burn's BBQ after an Anthony Bourdain episode. I've even smoked my own 8-pound pork shoulder. Dinosaur Bar-B-Que makes eating good barbeque in New York City easier for fanatics like me. Their kind of barbeque is my favorite. The meat is moist and falls off the bone with a dainty touch of the fork. There's a very faint sweet taste which makes the burnt ends even better. Everything else on our table was icing on the cake.

208 West 23rd Street off Seventh Avenue 212/524.4300 a large enough bill for 20 people including drinks and tip ♥ ♥ R.U.B., or Righteous Urban Barbeque, was the only restaurant in the city that was accommodating to more than 20 people. We had a few things to celebrate at work and, as usual, I got stuck with the task of organizing a get-together. Daisy May's did not want a large group before 8pm. Dinosaur Bar-B-Que was too far for my co-workers. Virgil's was too touristy. After bowling at Leisure Time in the Port Authority Terminal, we all took the subway down to Chelsea to eat. R.U.B. does not take reservations, but the guy on the phone told me coming in with a big group before 6pm won't be a problem. Sure enough, we were seated on a long table in the back after giving them a call ten minutes beforehand to tell them that we were on our way. I'm not a barbeque expert but I later found out that R.U.B.'s specialty is Kansas City style. I also realized after my visit that it's not my favorite. I thought the ribs were a little dry. I much preferred the pork butt which was very soft. The meat fell off the large bone and it had an addicting burnt cover I could not stop picking on. The fried green tomatoes and the cornbread were comparable from what I've tasted elsewhere. Their sandwiches were served with only pickles but the rest was far more generous. They got sufficient beer on tap, but none were my personal favorites. R.U.B.'s space is a little tight. The friendly staff makes it an anomaly in the Chelsea neighborhood, but there's nothing wrong with that, even if you come out smelling like smoked meat.

Because Iceland is famous for its cod, the Dr. became very interested in eating fish and chips after reading about the Kebab House. The name doesn't scream fish and chips, but the writeup proclaimed it offered the best in the city. Because cod is plentiful in Iceland, I assume Kebab House had several chances to get them right. The downtown location closed after the building burned down in the corner of Austurstraeti and Laekjargata. We had to drive to their other location on Grensasvegur. We drove to what looked like a plaza mall before heading out to the airport. It felt like we were transformed to a London pub as soon as we walked in. All the TVs were on showing football games. Famous jerseys were hanging on the walls. Blokes were drinking beer and smoking cigarettes while playing billiards. It wasn't even noon yet. The Dr. ordered fish and chips. I ordered the lamb gyro because I was still insistent on having good lamb before leaving Iceland. We've had fish and chips from England to Harlem and they've all tasted differently because of the fish used and how they were fried. The Kebab House cod version was light and not weighed down by so much batter. I'm not sure what oil they use but the fish was definitely not soaking wet. The chips were also light and crispy. The gyro was nothing special. I could not finish the heavy pita anyway, but I have to say the lamb chunks tasted better and were more flavorful than my overdone saddle of lamb the night before.

Our Iceland guide books made such a big deal about Baejarins Beztu Pylsur that we had to check it out. It's a hot dog stand on Posthusstraeti, next to the Kolaportio flea market on weekends, and it's lauded by eager locals as one of Iceland's national foods. When we walked by before noon, the line was already long. They must be good hot dogs, right? I'm from New York City and we have Nathan's and Sabrett hot dogs on the streets. We have Gray's Papaya and Sparky's. But perhaps Reykjavik has a say, too. So we joined the queue and bought ourselves a hot dog-what they call \"A Clinton\" after Bill Clinton made a stop during one of his trips to the country. The verdict? We ordered a hot dog with ketchup and mustard. I added fried onions on mine. It looked like a hot dog and, well, it tasted like a hot dog. What's the big deal again?

For our first dinner in Reykjavik, we ended up at Vin og Skel on a small alley off the main shopping street of Laugavegur. We didn't have reservations, but when we walked in, the waitress led us to the only two-person table upstairs. We were surrounded by two large groups. It felt like we were crashing two different parties. Their entire menu was written on a blackboard which reminded me of any laid-back New England seafood restaurant, but the seafood at Vin og Skel was better than any I've had here in the States. Owner Kristjan Noi is not shy about experimenting, but the best dishes were the simplest. A pail of mussels was comforting in some broth flavored with leeks. My glass of white wine wasn't as cold as I would have liked, so the mussels made me wish I ordered beer instead. My main dish, part of the \"surprise menu\" I selected, was a lobster-catfish-monkfish combination with white sauce. The dish was a little too salty but the lobster and the fish were the freshest I've had in a long time. Both fish were cooked just right: the meat tender with some give. The Dr.'s bacalao, or cod, an abundant fish in Iceland, was also really good. Unfortunately, it was also oversalted. His came with brown stock and potatoes, which were perfect to combat the chill coming in through the French doors next to the kitchen. They were offering minke whale carpaccio as a special. I am currently doing research about whaling in Iceland to see if the meat for sale in their markets are from scientific research only, but that night, the Dr. and I simply couldn't resist. The whale meat was of a deep-burgundy red, like beets, sliced thinly and drizzled with olive oil. The tops of what looked like radish greens had the perfect bitter taste to accompany the beefiness of the whale. It wasn't at all fishy and it tasted like a very expensive cut of beef. The Dr. felt more awful than I did because he loves to fish, but when asked if he'll eat it again, say in Japan where it's also \"allowed,\" he said yes. We ended our night with creme brulee served with a dainty gooseberry on top. It came with my prix fixe. Our temples were pounding because of the salt we've consumed and my eyes were a little tired from squinting all night because the space was not well lit. In the end, both helped us fork over our $200 with only a glass of wine and a Pillsner Urquel. We saved a lot of money while we were on the road but we surely blew a lot just in one night!

Where to eat in Reykjavik, Iceland: Carpe Diem

Dinner the second night was at Carpe Diem inside the Foss Hotel. Since we arrived in Reykjavik, we've been eating a lot of the local seafood. We wanted to taste the local fare of lamb and the much-heard about puffin. Carpe Diem prides itself in the two. We started with the Icelandic feast: a plate of salmon, herring and two kinds of roe served with crème fraiche. A small side of mixed greens and the accompanying wheat bread would have made it perfect for lunch. I was excited to finally eat the puffin. We were in Iceland in the beginning of the summer season and all the puffins were beginning to nest. We tried to stop by Dyrholaey but it was inaccessible, so we were unable to see them close-up. I thought that if I can't see them, I might as well eat them. They always say, When in Rome... The lundi is the national bird of Iceland, but they're obviously not shy about eating them. My smoked puffin was neither gamey nor fishy as expected. It looked like beef with the beautiful marbling. It also tasted like fresh, high-quality beef. Unfortunately, it was served with unexciting shredded iceberg lettuce and zucchini and a dollop of white sauce which tasted like ranch dressing. I thought it would have been better if it was served carpaccio-style, drizzled with good olive oil. We split an order of saddle of lamb. Before we ordered it, we asked our waitress if saddle was the term they use for rack of lamb. She said that it was. However, we were served the loin. To top it off, it was overdone. If it wasn't for its gamey taste, I would have confused it with well-done pork chops. Mushrooms, carrots, celery and squared potatoes mingled with a few pieces of blueberries. They all drowned in some kind of brown sauce. The balsamic reduction sauce was burnt. Who the hell was cooking in the kitchen? After a large family left, we were the only two in the restaurant. I would have thought that the chef would cook our lamb with care because the kitchen wasn't so busy. I was terribly disappointed. I just assumed that Icelanders don't eat lamb medium-rare and that was why we weren't asked about our preference.

1. Yes, everyone speaks English in Reykjavik. In the south, we met a few who speak very little English, but they were still accommodating. All of the hostel, restaurant, gas station and supermarket staff spoke English, too. 2. Iceland is indeed expensive. They have to import most of their food supply. A beer and a glass of house wine cost us US$25 or 1,500 kronurs.

On the road back to Reykjavik, we drove by a sign that said \"glacier walk\" right outside Solheimajokull. I casually asked the Dr. if he wanted to check it out. He shrugged and made a U-turn. We drove down a gravel path, parked our car and walked to the opening of a glacier. We thought the sign would tell us to keep out because it looked a little delicate, with ice melting and water dripping. When we got closer to the sign, it only warned us against falling ice. We turned on our video cameras and started shooting as we entered the dark ice cave. It was the coolest detour ever! Inside was a running brook formed by the melting ice. It was a little eerie and scary because the glacier has been melting throughout the years. Deep inside me, I was hoping that the thing won't collapse while we were inside. I got claustrophobic after a few minutes, so I walked out and climbed up. The surface of the glacier was spotty-volcanic sand from Katla peeking through the ice. I imagined it was all covered in ice hundreds of years ago, but alas, we were witnessing the effects of global warming. We just kept driving towards Reykjavik, eager to check in the hostel and rest since the Dr. had been driving since 10:30am. On our way there, we decided to skip town and drive to the Blue Lagoon to avoid the weekend crowd. It was the second best detour of our trip. We paid the fee of what turned out to be $20 each and soaked in the lagoon with the other tourists. It felt good to be in a hot spring with the sun shining. There were wooden chests around the pool filled with volcanic clay. We imitated everyone else and put them on our faces like mud masks. In between soaks, we spent time inside the saunas. After the novelty ran off though, it was just like being in a regular pool. We felt the gooey clay beneath our feet. I grabbed some with my hands but there was hair all over. Gah! It was time to get out! The best part was getting out of the hot water and running to the showers in the cold. I'll refrain from describing the feeling of seeing a hundred naked women of all shapes and sizes in the locker room. We were completely relaxed when we arrived in our hostel. We were ready to conquer Reykjavik.

We said good-bye to Fljotsadalur to start our drive towards Vik, our next destination for the night. On the way there, we stopped by Skogafoss, a pretty waterfall right behind another hostel that was still closed for the season. It was pretty huge but it wasn't as deafening and impressive as Gulfoss. After checking in the hostel and eating lunch, we walked to the black sand beach of Reynisdrangur. They are tall fingers of black rock jutting out from the sea. The crashing waves contribute to the pure Gothic scene-all I needed was some Bjork music in the background. If the water wasn't cold and the wind wasn't blowing, it would have been the perfect beach with a view. We still had a whole day ahead of us, so we drove all the way to the border of the southeast. We ended our drive at Svinafellsjokull just enough to get a glimpse of Vatnajokull. The travelers we met had two to three weeks of holiday and they were going around the entire country. The rest of Iceland will just have to wait until we return. Our first stop was Lanfskalavaroa, this haunting open area of rocks on top of each other. You know when you hike and come across a pile of rocks that were left by other hikers to show you the right way? This was the mother of all those piles of rocks. It's a tradition to put a rock on top of any of the piles before you continue your way so the Dr. and I put our own rocks on top of a pile before continuing down the road. The scenery began to change as we approached the southeast. The moss-covered lava created by eruptions from the Laki volcano that lasted for ten months and wiped off several communities around it began to look green. We entered the southeast through the town of Kirkjubaejarklaustur and stopped by Foss, a thin waterfall right on a beautiful farm. It was like entering a fairy tale: the sun was shining, the flowers were blooming and then the waterfall ahead of us was quietly trickling. Iceland is a completely different country when the sun is shining. Down the road were the basalt columns of Dverghamrar, also known as the Cliffs of the Dwarfs. They reminded me of Giant's Causeway in Ireland with their hexagonal shapes naturally formed overtime. Right at the base of the Lomagnupur cliff, we found the 18th-century church of Nupsstadur in an abandoned village frozen by time. If Foss was like a fairy tale, this was like the set of an old movie. I felt like someone was going to appear out of nowhere. The church door was unlocked. We walked in and there was a small altar with a photo of the Sacred Heart. We continued driving along Skeidararsandur, the biggest of the southern sandurs, or wasteland of black sand and glacial debris from volcanic eruptions under the the largest icecap in the country, Vatnajokull. Before the Ring Road was built, the only way here was by horseback. Before heading back to Vik, we found out that Dyrholaey was inaccessible because of nesting season. Another two weeks and we would have seen the country's national bird, the puffin, all over the rocks and the beach. At least we were able to see the stone arch from Hallsanef Hellir. The caves also had the basalt columns but also sharp black edges that looked brittle and thin from afar. About an hour and a speeding ticket from the Icelandic police later, we were back in Vik, reunited with the two Germans and playing Monopoly over some wine, rum and vodka. The Dr. whipped up some pasta dish to remake the leftover chicken from the night before as we finished the last bottle of wine from my suitcase.

The Dr. dreams a lot when we're on vacation. As I tried to enjoy my morning sleep, the best type of all sleeps, he flinched and murmured with his eyes closed. I kept waking up because of him that by the time I felt like I've had a complete, uninterrupted sleep, it was already 1pm. Luckily, the sun does not start setting until about 11pm so we knew we had plenty of time. We decided to go to Selfoss and get closer to the volcano Hekla since the road to Langjökull and Hofsjökull was closed. On our way to Selfoss, we saw a tour bus make a turn to Kerio. We followed it and parked our car. There wasn't anything on the map but it turned out to be a beautiful crater full of water. There was nothing in the town of Selfoss except a closed bakery (what, no fresh bread after 3pm?) and a library where we paid 100 kronas to use the Internet and email back home. We continued on for what seemed like miles and miles of dark earth to Mount Hekla. In medieval Europe, it was known as one of the twin mouths of hell because of how menacing it looked, hiding behind thick clouds. It is still active and the last eruption was in 2000. We stopped a couple of times to film the vast bleak view ahead of us. I found a few horses who were willing to cooperate, but otherwise, we didn't really do much except drive. We made up for it the next day. We felt like we were finally, truly in Iceland. We started our drive early towards Fljotsdalur. There were few houses on the road past the town of Hella but it was a very scenic route. I remember thinking, I wish we can stay in one of those small barns with grass on the roof. To my delight, the Fljotsdalur was one of them! We met Paul, one of the founders of the house with the infamous Dick Philipps of England. He's been coming to Iceland for the summer the last 30 years. They do group hiking tours to þorsmork, or Thor's forest. You can go there from hostel to hostel and cross the path between two icecaps, Eyjafjallajokull and Myrdalsjokull, but alas, we had to stay loyal to our tiny car which could only do so much. We only had a night so we decided to spend the rest of the day walking around the area. We walked up to the gorge and crossed a sheep farm to get closer photographs of Eyjafjallajokull. We crossed a bridge to go over a raging river and get on the other side. It felt like we were the only two people in the world. We walked for about three hours, taking photographs, shooting videos. It got cold when the clouds moved in. The sheep started walking back to the farm. We knew it was time to head back. When we returned to the hostel, we met a Dutch couple and two Germans. It wouldn't be a quiet night after all. The six of us all ended up chatting with Paul during dinner. The Dr. made a mean potato-cabbage salad with stewed chicken for our meal. (Everyone was amazed at how we simply could not subject ourselves to a simpler meal when hiking. They obviously don't know us that well.) In exchange for some cooking oil, we gave Paul a glass of wine. In exchange for a Tupperware container to take leftovers with us, we served him a plate during dinner. It was a nice night of getting to know strangers in a new country. Related post/s: Day 2 and 3 in Iceland: Laugarvatn to Fljotsdalur photos on Flickr Day 1: Keflavik to Laugarvatn, Iceland

We landed in Keflavik a quarter before seven in the morning. The line was long through customs. We had to go through X-ray again without our shoes and liquids since it was the point of entry to the rest of Europe for a lot of the passengers. Our luggage were waiting at baggage claim but we had to queue again to exchange our dollars to the local currency, krona. We picked up our light blue Honda Jazz from National with the pre-paid hostel vouchers I've reserved beforehand for the next six nights. Driving outside of Reykjavik, my first impression was that the country was bleak and a little eerie. There were a lot of construction going on but the view was mostly a dry and flat valley as far as the eye can see. Our first stop was along a road marked Stardalur to take photos of the ice-capped mountains ahead of us. There would be more and better photo opportunities along the way but I was eager to start shooting. We continued driving until we reached a spot with a tourist sign, the þingvellir, home of the þingvellir National Park set along the north of þingvallavatn, Iceland's largest lake at 30 square miles. There was really nothing there except squishy bog covered with dry wildflowers and a view of the blue lake, but apparently, it is the only place in Iceland declared by law as sacred because it was also the spot where the country's first settlers formed a commonwealth in the midst of Europe's feudal monarchies. The next stop was our home for the next two nights: Laugarvatn. It's a small town with a golf course and a small spas but they were all closed because it was still off-peak season. The bonus, of course, was the Laugarvatn lake outside our room which made the water safe to drink from tap. I never thought I would ever say that water tastes so good. But it's not a myth: Iceland has the best-tasting water. (Showering felt like I was wasting water; showering using what tasted and felt like bottled water!) After settling in, we heated up some of the food we packed: Korean jjajang tuna and Japanese rice with some pickled perillo leaves. We knew food was going to be expensive and if we wanted to eat well the rest of the week, we had to pack easy-open cans and microwavable packets. For the next few dinners, the Dr. cooked hot meals using ingredients we bought in gas station stores along the way. We drank all four bottles of wine I packed. Jet lag began to set in so we napped for a couple of hours. We woke up at 5pm local time, four hours ahead of New York, showered and made it to the town grocery store before it closed. We bought pasta and some sauce with the country's infamous yogurt, or skyr. (I'm not a big fan of yogurt but I found myself eating a tub of it every morning because they taste so much better in Iceland.) We started driving again on Route 35 and 37 to the Great Geysir which, sadly, hasn't spouted since several tourists poured gravel into its mouth to lower the water level and force an explosion. The Strokkur was more reliable and we watched it spout boiling water every five minutes or so up to 66 feet. The entire area is still geothermically active and it was hard not to try and test the hot temperatures while the cold numbing wind blew on our faces. In fact, there are reported \"accidents\" each year from people who forget what scalding water really means. We kept driving until we saw the sign for Gulfoss. Foss is \"waterfall\" in Icelandic and Gulfoss means \"golden falls.\" The road to the falls was barren and serene so it was an amazing sight to see the raging and deafening waters. Out of the calm was a welcomed chaos in a way. The river Hvita falls 105 feet into a mile-deep ravine and clouds of spray created rainbows. Langjökull and Hofsjökull, two large ice caps, were ahead of us. Alas, the road was closed to cars until the F-road is dry and safe. This is known as the Kjölur route and could have been done in a day. We drove back to our hostel and thought we'd try the hot springs at the Laugarvatn lake instead but it was closed. The two restaurants next door were empty, too. We went back to our room dejected but we ended up cooking and playing Scrabble until the sun partially set at midnight (!). Not so bad for our first day in Iceland. Related post/s: Day 1 in Iceland: Keflavik to Laugarvatn photos on Flickr

508 Greenwich Street off Spring 212/219-2444 ♥ ♥ Giorgione is a jewel of a place found in the transforming neighborhood of Greenwich Street and the West Side Highway. It reminds me of the delis in Europe where locals eat and drink wine in the middle of the afternoon or leisurely enjoy coffee with a pastry. As soon as you walk in, you're confronted with lunch boxes of greens with chicken or seared tuna. The long glass bars invite you to sit and casually enjoy your meal. It is that civilized way of living which delights me about Giorgione. When the restaurant is full during busy lunch hours, it looks like a happy communal space with beautifully-dressed New Yorkers. My seared tuna looked more like sashimi but it was perfect with the bean and tomato salad. The baby arugula and endive salad with goat cheese became a more interesting dish when citrus and toasted pine nuts were added. I think a bowl of greens is easy to make, but a well-done salad is a hard feat. Giorgione does it easily and well. The hanger steak sandwich with stewed onions was large and filling, but the meatball sandwich covered in a big blob of mozarella looked unappetizing. All the lunch items are a bit pricey but this Italian joint is a nice break from the usual hangouts on Hudson Street.

Where to eat in Washington, D.C.: Central Michel Richard

I was too young to remember my first visit to Washington, D.C. with my parents. The Dr. has never been. So when we heard that Arcade Fire was playing in D.C. before New York, we bought tickets and decided to make a weekend out of it. It was just icing on the cake when I found out that Miriam was moving to the District from San Francisco (she's in-love; bless hear heart). Michel Richard was inducted in the James Beard Foundation even before bloggers out there knew how important James Beard was to the culinary industry. His flagship Washington, D.C. restaurant, Citronelle, has been numerously named as one of the best restaurants in the country. When he decided to open an affordable bistro on Pennsylvania Avenue called Central, loyal fans and curious eaters waited eagerly. I've never been to Citronelle so I have no way to compare head chef Cedric Maupiller's signature dishes with Michel Richard's. The French onion soup was simple; breaking into the cheese was like opening a surprise gift. The frisée salad was served with a poached egg. I appreciated the fact that after we requested it be split in two, we each got our own egg. The filet mignon tartare tasted all of mustard and pickles. I couldn't savor the beef flavor I always look for in tartare. The crispy fries that came with it, though, were addicting. My soft-shell crabs were meaty and I could have eaten them on their own without the coleslaw. The fried chicken was buttery but surprisingly light. Even though we were never told where the dozen oysters specifically came from, we enjoyed them with our rosé sparkling wine. The small Brussels sprouts reminded me of mashed potatoes in my mouth, mushy and wet, but nothing cooked with bacon ever disappoints me. After a second bottle of wine, we ended our night with the famous Kit Kat bar which tasted like, well, a giant Kit Kat chocolate bar. It was so rich that the ice cream with it was almost unnecessary. It was definitely for someone with a sweet tooth and a lot of room after a full dinner. The mostly American fare came together at the end, but the service provided wasn't up to par. Our waiter was a little bit surly. Perhaps because we asked to move to another table as soon as we sat down. Perhaps because we couldn't make a decision on what to order. When we finally did, we chose mostly appetizers. There was a lag in service in between our oysters and our orders. When our food came, the empty oyster shells were still on our table. He made up for the surlyness by requesting the kitchen to appropriately split a couple of our dishes in two as we requested, but he made me wonder about what we or anyone else did to ruin his night. And though most people may not care, I was a bit surprised that our used plates were stacked on top of each other when the staff was cleaning the table. Surely, they do not do the same thing at Citronelle. Do regular citizens like us have to receive a lesser quality of service just because we're dining at the bistro and paying $100 less?

Gourmet Magazine published this Moqueca Capixaba Brazilian fish stew in their food and travel issue. I remember reading the recipe on my way home and my mouth started watering. I knew the cilantro and lime were going to be key here so I ended up putting double the amount for both. This became one of my favorite dishes this spring. Ingredients: 2 pieces of cod fillets, pat dry with paper towel 1/4 pound of shrimps, peeled and deveined juice from 2 limes 1 bunch of cilantro, roughly chopped 3 plum tomatoes, chopped 1 red bell pepper, chopped 1 large red onion, chopped 2 yellow plantains, peeled, halved and cut into 8 pieces 5 cloves of garlic, minced red pepper flakes salt, olive oil 1. In a shallow bowl, stir together lime juice and red pepper flakes, garlic and salt. Pour over cod fillets and shrimps. Cover and marinate while you prepare the vegetables. 2. Put tomatoes in a large Dutch oven. Top with the onions and bell pepper. Place plantains on top and season with some salt. Arrange the fish and the shrimps on top of the vegetables. Sprinkle cilantro over the fish and pour over lime-garlic marinade with some oil. 3. Bring to a simmer and then cover the pot. Adjust heat to gently simmer for about 20 minutes, until vegetables are soft and fish and shrimps are cooked through. Related post/s: Fish stew, Korean version

222 West 79th Street off Amsterdam Avenue 212/873.0200 $45 for two people, with one drink, without tip ♥ ♥ I was really surprised at how Onera had changed. The navy blue and white walls remained so I was taken aback when I walked in the lower-level space of Kefi. I was even more shocked when our bill was delivered. Sure, I didn't have any wine that night and we made a meal out of several mezes, but it's been a long time since the Dr. and I have spent less than $50 on dinner. Chef Michael Psilakis' Onera was one of my favorite places during its heyday. Gone are the long tables and nice chairs but the straightforward taverna food is still on the menu. I was recovering from being sick and when my appetite came back, I was pining for warm pita and an octopus. (I'm weird like this often.) When the spreads were served, I couldn't stop myself from eating them. The yogurt was tart, the caviar salty, the eggplant mushy and the hummus garlicky-four sensations I wouldn't ask less of on any given night. The sweetbreads were crispy with breaded onion rings and an addicting sauce with giant capers. I'm not the biggest fan of capers but they were excellent with the offal. (Oh, the offal tasting menu of Onera!) I would have wanted the octopus with a crispier crust but I absolutely loved the bed of chickpeas and black-eyed peas with parsley. If not for the overwhelming garlic in the mashed potatoes, the cod would have been one of the best fish dishes I've had as of late. Not that all the garlic stopped us. Everything tasted like they were done out of love; like a Greek grandma was in the kitchen telling us to \"Eat, eat, eat!\" because all our dishes were served all at once. Greek food I must say, is a cuisine I started to love as soon as I started taking photographs of my food, and it will be in New York City to stay.

71 Spring Street between Crosby and Lafayette Streets 212/966.5050 $120 for two people, with four drinks at the bar, with tip ♥ I haven't been to a nice bathroom with communal sinks since my clubbing days-and I mean, like a real club, not the ridiculous Sea in Williamsburg, Brooklyn-and I've never been to AIX Brasserie either, chef Didier Virot's first venture with Philip Kirsh, so it was like a new experience walking into Fr.Og with pink leather seats and silver-beaded walls. What could possibly come out from the kitchen of a place looking like this in the middle of SoHo? The menu is French with Vietnamese, African and Middle Eastern influences, but really sounds less confusing on a plate. Fried spring rolls, or Vietnamese nem ran, has the traditional pork and shrimp with cucumber, lettuce and carrot on the side dressed with mint and garlic dressing. They were perfectly dainty and crunchy; the mint starting a party in my mouth. The Lebanese tabbouleh was better than the seared lamb loin served on top of it with its texture giving life to the cold, almost-limp tongue slivers of lamb. I only wished there was more of the foie gras encrusted in ginger. I didn't even need the mango coulis and the soy-balsamic sauce with it. The drinks were even better than the appetizers. A coconut-lemongrass infused martini was beautifully done and so was a request for a citrusy and fruity cocktail after our meal. The maitre d' and the bartender were equally nice and accommodating, quite a pleasure from a restaurant that plays dance music in the background. Chef Didier is known for the short-lived Virot at the Dylan Hotel (later taken over by none other than Britney Spears's NYLA, also short-lived) but his partnership with Jean-Georges Vongerichten as executive chef at JoJo should be taken more into account. The guy can obviously cook and has a tremendous palate to be able to translate different cuisines on each dish, but at $120 for three small plates and four drinks, I don't know if people are hurrying to flock the place. I would come back, though, to use that bathroom. Related post/s: Cheaper Vietnamese food at Xe Lua minus the pretty bathrooms

When I begin to see ramps for sale in the farmers' market, I only think of one thing: it's spring. I bought a couple of bunches last Wednesday and stopped by the High Hope Hog tent to pick up a package of their spicy chorizo. For the last few ramp seasons, I've sautéed them with bacon or pancetta. This time, I wanted to try something slightly different. I'm loving the fruit-in-my-salad thing lately, maybe because we East Coasters have been deprived of fruits all winter, but there have been beautiful strawberries in the market and I wanted to add a little bit of sweet and tart to this dish. The result? The ramps balanced the perfect combination of subtle fruitiness and pork saltiness. Ingredients: 2 bunches of ramps 3 pieces of spicy chorizo a handful of fresh strawberries, sliced thinly a bowl of ice water salt, pepper, olive oil 1. Add thoroughly washed ramps in boiling water for four minutes. When they're done, drain and shock them in ice water to stop its cooking. 2. Using a large skillet, heat some oil and fry the sausages until brown on all sides. While cooking, crush the sausages in smaller pieces with a wooden spoon. 3. Using the same skillet, add the ramps and toss them in the rendered fat with salt and pepper. Plate and serve with strawberries.

58 MacDougal Street between Prince and Houston 212/674.4968 $90 for two, with a bottle of red, without tip ♥ ♥ I've walked by Salt many times and have always been curious. We stopped by on a Friday night without reservations. They were completely booked but the waitress invited us to sit down with a \"We'll figure it out when the couple with the table comes in.\" As soon as we joined the other diners at one of the long tables, a whole bottle of red was in order-other couple be damned. The rack of lamb was well-executed. The crust was crispy and the meat perfectly medium-rare. The Dr. opted for one of their Protein + 2 options: duck breast with sautéed eggplant and braised leeks. The meat was a little overdone but the vegetables were simple and undeniably hearty. Other safe choices included a grilled dorade, roasted chicken, Newport steak and a bowl of pasta. Fennel, asparagus, artichokes and Yukon gold potatoes were available as side dishes. The menu may be unexciting but our dessert spoke volumes: a plum tart frangipane topped with a delicious rosemary ice cream. I've fallen in-love with a restaurant before because of the ambiance and upon entering Salt, my heart pitter-pattered. Wooden communal tables occupy most of its intimate space. The open kitchen behind the bar invites you to sit, eat, drink wine and enjoy a conversation. The dim, warm lights make you feel like you're in someone's gorgeous apartment with exposed bricks. As the night leisurely passed and the buzz around us became intoxicating, we just wanted to stay. Related post/s: Provence is only a few stores down

The Cornish hens were on sale at my grocery store. I bought two and thought about cooking the chicken and pomegranate stew recipe I published a couple of weeks ago. I didn't have vegetables so I just used the spices in my cupboard. The meat fell off the bones easily so I ended up deboning the hens while the liquid reduced and thickened. For texture, I added some sesame seeds and crushed almonds before serving. Ingredients: 2 Cornish hens 2 tbsps pomegranate molasses 1/4 cup honey 1 red onion, chopped 3 cloves garlic, minced 12 threads saffron, soaked in 3 tbsps of hot water 1 tsp ground ginger 1 tsp ground cinnamon 1 tsp nutmeg 1 pinch of whole cloves, grounded 4 parsley stems, chopped 2 bay leaves 1/4 cup whole blanched almonds, crushed, toasted 1 tbsp sesame seeds, toasted salt, pepper, olive oil 1. Preheat oven to 350º. In the meantime, heat olive oil in a large Dutch oven. Sauté the garlic and the onions. Add and brown the Cornish hens on all sides. Remove the hens to a plate. 2. Add all the spices including the saffron to the pot with 2 cups of water. Simmer and reduce until somewhat thickened for 25 minutes. Then add the pomegranate and honey to the liquid and let simmer while gently scraping off the bits from the bottom of the pan. Season with salt and pepper. Add the hens back, cover the pot and put in the oven for 10 minutes. 3. When done, carefully remove the pot from the oven. Remove and discard bay leaves. Using a pair of tongs and a fork, slowly take off the meat from the bones. The hens should be so soft and tender that the meat just slides off the bones. Discard the bones. Plate meat and top with toasted sesame seeds and almonds. Related post/s: I like my pomegranate and Cornish hens

Sullivan Street Bakery's No-Knead Bread

***CONTENT
Last November, The New York Times published this no-knead bread recipe from Jim Lahey of Sullivan Street Bakery and food bloggers everywhere went berserk. But it requires some time and I couldn't squeeze in a day and a half to try it myself last year. Fast-forward five months later and I've adjusted the recipe according to the trials and errors posted on the Web and finally tried it at home this past weekend when the summer weather called for my own homemade bread. As you may or may not know, I'm scared of baking. I'm a better cook than baker because with cooking, I can adjust ingredients and steps by taste. I feel like with baking, I can never turn back. Baking makes me afraid of making mistakes while cooking allows me to make room for circumstances that may be beyond my control. So you can imagine when I tried this recipe and it came out looking like, well, bread. I was squealing with delight! I sat down with my mother, opened a bottle of Chateau de La Chaize and ate it with cheese and anchovies, pintxos style. Ingredients: 3 cups all-purpose white flour, more for dusting 1/4 tsp instant yeast 1 1/4 tsp salt 1 1/2 cups water 1. In a large glass bowl, combine flour, yeast and salt. Add 1 1/2 cups water and stir with a wooden spatula until blended. Your dough will be sticky. Cover bowl with plastic wrap. Let dough rest at least 12 hours, preferably about 18, at warm room temperature, about 70 degrees. 2. Dough is ready when its surface is dotted with bubbles. Lightly flour a work surface and place dough on it. Sprinkle it with a little more flour and fold it over on itself once or twice. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and let rest for about 15 minutes. 3. Using just enough flour to keep dough from sticking to work surface or to your fingers, gently and quickly shape dough into a ball. Generously coat a cotton towel (not terry cloth) with flour. Put dough on the towel and dust the top of the dough with more flour. Cover with another cotton towel and let rise for another 2 hours. When it is ready, dough will be more than double in size and will not readily spring back when poked with a finger. 4. At least 30 minutes before dough is ready, heat oven to 450º. Put a large Dutch oven in the oven as it heats. When dough is ready, carefully remove pot from oven. Gently place dough into pot. It will still be a little sticky. Shake pan once or twice if dough is unevenly distributed. It may look like a mess but it will straighten out as it bakes. Cover with lid and bake for 30 minutes, then remove lid and bake another 15 minutes, until loaf is beautifully browned. Cool on a chopping block.

45 Bond Street between Lafayette and Bowery 212/529.8600 $120 for two, with 3 drinks, with tip ♥ ♥ It was a Monday night and Mercat has only been open for three days, yet the decibel level made it seem like it was a Thursday night. The place is packed; the white tiles immediately reminded me of Cal Pep in Barcelona. One of the bartenders gave me a long-stemmed pink rose to alleviate my 25-minute wait for a seat at the bar in front of the restaurant. (I saw later that every woman in the house was holding the same rose. I wasn't so special after all.) The sausage and cheese station was manned by one doing all the slicing and plating and was surrounded by the curious also waiting for the bathroom to free up. In the back, the open kitchen was being watched by the more important people who sat at the chef's bar. Everyone seemed to be in good spirits. We started with the crispy sweetbreads on a bed of fennel, orange and capers. It was a light and delicious appetizer to an unexpectedly heavy meal. The grilled sardines were great with salsa verde even though I was picking small, thin bones off my mouth the entire time. What made my night, however, was the braised pork belly served with crosnes, my latest favorite vegetable. Never mind that it also came with asparagus which seemed pretty boring compared to the sauce that made the dish special: a dollop of preserved cherries. No one should be afraid of eating their meals with fruit; I could have eaten this all night with my glass of cava. The mushroom dish will mostly likely leave Mercat bankrupt. For only $12-and I can't believe I'm saying \"only\" here-I think I tasted sautéed morels, hen-of-the-woods, shiitake and crimini mushrooms on my plate. The last time I stopped by a Whole Foods, morels were going for $60 for a pound. A very earthy and filling dish served with crunchy strings of potatoes and topped with a fried egg was hard to resist even if the egg was a little overdone. They ran out of razor clams by 10pm and I totally missed the blistered Padron peppers from the top of the menu, so we finished with the snails and chorizo skewers. It sounded promising but what happened to this dish? The snails tasted like they've been in the bottom of an aquarium for days. The chorizo-tomato salsa could not even cover the algae taste that we decided to leave the dish unfinished. From my experience at Cal Pep, the meals got better as the night wiled away. At Mercat, the night started inspiringly, but after I ate the snails, all I wanted was to rewind my experience back to the pork belly and back to Spain.

Cameron asked me what else she can do with squid. Xe Lua does a really great crispy squid appetizer but most restaurants treat squid like shrimps-they overcook them until they're chewy and rubbery. And really, calamares can't be the only way. I once read that you either cook squid for two minutes or two hours. Once you cross that overdone threshold, you have to keep cooking it to soften it. For this Filipino adobo recipe, you cook the squid for about ten minutes. My father would tell you that you just know when to turn the heat off. Don't be afraid to poke them with your fork to check the tenderness. At least I can tell you how to clean the squid: slice across the tentacles near the eyes to pull out the innards and the plastic-like spine. You'll see a small pocket in there which holds the ink. I keep a couple of them intact for color. Discard the rest but keep the tentacles. It's okay for the tentacles to completely separate from the body. Rinse thoroughly. Ingredients: 1 1/2 pound fresh squid, cleaned 1 medium head of garlic, peeled, crushed 2 tbsp white vinegar 1 tsp whole black peppercorns salt 1. In a saucepan, bring squid, peppercorns and garlic to a low boil for 5 minutes. The squid will make its own juice from the ink pockets you left intact, so no need to add water. Do not stir. 2. When squid is tender, add vinegar and bring to a second low boil for about 5 minutes. Do not stir. Season with a little salt. Add a little more vinegar to taste.

39-07 Prince Street, Flushing, Queens 718/359.1601 ♥ ♥ ♥ The pain didn't take effect until five minutes into our meal. When I say pain, I'm talking about our tongues going numb, beads of sweat starting to dot our foreheads, a ringing sensation behind our ears and ooze starting to form in our small noses. All were good pain, mind you, and even as they got worse, we kept eating. If you like your Sichuan Chinese food, you know what I'm talking about and if you venture to Flushing, Queens, then you know that spicy and tasty are enough adjectives to describe the Spicy & Tasty buffet. We were in Queens to check out the panorama of the City of New York in the Queens Museum. We hardly take the number 7 train so when we found ourselves in the city's largest borough, the most ethnically diverse county in the entire United States, we decided to continue on to Flushing and look for a late afternoon meal. We're not familiar with the neighborhood at all so we stopped by Duane Reade to steal a glance inside one of the city magazines. Unfortunately, there was always one restaurant listed under Queens, but luckily, Spicy & Tasty was the one selected by The New Yorker. The restaurant was only an avenue away from the subway so we took the quick hike, feeling very determined to eat spicy Chinese food. The Dr. grew up in Los Angeles and if he misses a cuisine more than Korean, it would be Sichuan Chinese. We have several Shanghainese Chinese restaurants in New York, but only a few good Sichuan places. He would recall to me trips to Monterey Park eating spicy dish after spicy dish flavored by fagara peppercorns. In fact, the last time I went to Los Angeles without him, I went to his favorite Sichuan restaurant and finally understood why a good sweat is sometimes appeciated and even necessary. To my delight, his eyes lit up as soon as we walked in Spicy & Tasty. He wanted to order everything behind the glass. We pointed and picked three dishes and added a soup and a bowl of dan dan noodles to our bill from our table. The culprits were the spicy root vegetable, the crispy tendon salad and the dan dan noodles. We took turns picking the pieces with our chopsticks, blowing through our tongues and stuffing our mouths with the smoked tofu and celery to ease away the numbness. When the pork and squash soup was served, it was like water to two quenched survivors. I found myself playing with the Filipino upo in my mouth to dilute the spicy and garlicky combination of the dan dan noodle sauce. There was laughter, imagining how we looked like that moment, and then the laughter turned into quiet, happy tears.

Most of our group lunches at work are ordered via FreshDirect. Every New Yorker has also seen their delivery vans all over the city-albeit not in my part of Harlem-but I've never ordered from them until today. The New York Times announced this week that chef Roberto Santibañez of Rosa Mexicano has collaborated with FreshDirect to offer Mexican microwavable meals to its customers. I've never been to \"New York insitution\" Rosa Mexicano because I try not to eat Mexican food from restaurants deemed \"upscale and authentic.\" I never buy TV dinners either but the spiel was that these Fresh Dining Meals contain no butter, very little cream and only vegetable-based oils are used in their sauces. The prospect of a healthy-sounding Mexican dish in \"revolutionary microwavable containers\" was intriguing. I signed up on FreshDirect.com, ordered six of the Rosa Mexicano Fresh Dining Meals and had them delivered to work. An hour after the estimated delivery time and $78.93 later, four co-workers signed up to be my guinea pigs. 1. Beef Short Rib Enchiladas with Salsa Mestiza and Cactus, $9.99 I loved how spicy it was but I didn't really taste the short ribs nor remember the cactus. I did appreciate the real parsley garnish. Cameron thought that the beef was a little bland. She agreed that it was spicy but she also thought that it just didn't have a lot of flavor. The tortillas were falling apart which made them the \"most Mexican.\" 2. Chicken in Ancho Chili Adobo with Green Beans and Shiitakes, $8.99 Luc said the chicken was too hard. He felt that he was eating something very healthy, but later added that his comment meant that he was still hungry. 3. Halibut in Tomatillo Herb Mole with Red Bliss Potatoes and Asparagus, $13.99 I really liked the vegetables because the short ribs were too salty from the other dish that I took comfort in eating the zucchini from this. Cameron said the sauce tasted very fresh. She was really impressed with the softness of the fish because she expected less from a microwavable meal. She also said that there was a nice meat-to-sauce ratio although the vegetable choices-red potatoes, asparagus and zucchini-weren't very Mexican. She thought the potatoes were too heavy with the fish and would have prefered rice or grilled scallions or piquillo peppers. 4. Shrimp in Red Bell Pepper and Chipotle Cream Sauce, $10.99 I was surprised that the shrimp was clear and wondered whether I did not microwave the dish long enough. I actually ended up liking this dish because of that fact. I usually do not order shrimps because most of the time, they are overcooked, tough and chewy. Cameron thought they were just undercooked. Aaron said he didn't even notice because it was \"yummy to my tummy.\" Aaron liked the sauce that Cameron called \"too creamy for Mexican food,\" although she liked the spice. Out of the three things she tasted, she said that this is the one dish she will not order again. Aaron just felt bad. 5. Turbot in Veracruz Sauce over Achiote Rice with Asparagus and Chayote, $9.99 Taste was overall average for Ben. The fish was a little overcooked but \"pretty good for a microwavable meal.\" The asparagus was too soggy and the rice was too mushy, both of which he attributed to the sloppy sauce, which was just \"okay.\" He thought there wasn't enough rice and he found himself looking for more as he ate the fish. He said he would put it slightly higher than Trader Joe's microwavable meals, but at $10, he expected much more. He would not buy it again and will stay loyal to Trader Joe's because they charge $5 for theirs. 6. Grilled Chicken in Tequila-Mushroom Cream Sauce with Snow Peas, $8.99 It was only after I tasted this dish that I understood Luc's description of the chicken being too hard. This dish contained a huge breast of chicken, complete with grill marks, and I needed a real knife to properly slice through it. The snow peas were so crunchy, they may have been raw, which was not a problem to me. Like all the others, this was also smothered in sauce. The combination of tequila and mushrooms made the sauce taste a little nutty that at first taste, I thought there was some peanut butter in it. I added my own rice to this and I enjoyed it more because it kept the saltiness at bay. As for the packaging, the containers looked snazzier than the ones I can buy from regular grocery stores. After heating up, though, the tab was very difficult to pull back. We all ended up poking them with our plastic forks-not provided by FreshDirect-to open. It only took four minutes to heat up each container and I thought that was so convenient. We work downtown in New York City and we're all used to paying at least $8 for lunch, but we wanted more. An hour later, I was snacking on Ritz crackers. I also had to order at least $60 worth of items to qualify for FreshDirect delivery. The delivery fee was a steep $14.99 but they did come in the next day, twenty-four hours after I ordered online. The overall taste verdict? FreshDirect Rosa Mexicano Fresh Dining Meals are a little over-salted and saucy, but not so bad in taste in terms of microwavable food. In terms of Mexican food, however, all of us say, \"so-so.\" Related post/s: Rosa Mexicana Fresh Dining Meals at FreshDirect.com Searching for a good taco in New York City

A recent visit to the farmers' market introduced me to hydroponic tomatoes and basil. It was the Shushan Valley Hydro-Farms' first day at the market and one of the organizers walked me to their stall after I expressed disappointment that there were no vegetable vendors around. Sure it was a rainy day but a girl needs her vegetables! I've only heard of the term hydroponic in relation to a certain addictive herb, so when the owners showed me a photo of their farm, I was intrigued. A variety of techniques exist in hydroponic gardening. Instead of soil containing silt and clay, mineral nutrient solutions are introduced to the plants' water supply. Because plants absorb essential mineral nutrients as inorganic ions in water, soil is no longer required for the plants to thrive when the minerals are artifically added. Their tomatoes were happily plump and the basil leaves all had a nice shade of healthy green. I love the idea that I don't have to wait for Mother Nature to make up her mind about the weather before I can buy tomatoes. I bought a basil plant for less than $3, picked several of its leaves for this caprese recipe and three weeks later, it's still thriving in a water-filled small plastic cup on my window sill. I can't say the same for the tomatoes though; I bought five of them and they were all gone by next morning. Ingredients: 2 plum tomatoes, thinly sliced fresh mozarella, sliced fresh basil leaves, thoroughly washed, patted dry, chiffonade salt, pepper, olive oil 1. Arrange tomatoes and mozarella on a plate. Top with basil leaves and drizzle with olive oil. Sprinkle with salt and pepper.

38 MacDougal Street off Prince 212/475.7500 $80 for two, with 3 drinks, without tip ♥ ♥ Updated, 2008: Provence will reopen in May as Hundred Acres. I was delighted when I walked by Provence several months ago and saw that it was reopening with help from the owners of Five Points and Cookshop. I've eaten at Five Points twice without reservations and both times I left impressed and satisfied. I've only stopped by Cookshop for a drink, but one of their bartenders made them so beautifully, I stayed for two more. I visited Provence during opening week and felt completely at home as soon as I sat at the bar. The interior is a great mix of femininity and masculinity without the frills. Victor Hugo has never looked so good in a bathroom! Who knew homey furniture could be so sexy? I can't wait to return when the windows are open and the flower boxes are filled in the summer. We started with the endive salad with treviso, arugula and parmesan, a salad that would have been boring if not for its spiky lemon-anchovy dressing. I love bitter greens flavored by a little tart but kept at bay by aged, hard cheese. The sardines were lightly coated in breadcrumbs and served with lemon and chili oil-the right combination of tanginess and spiciness. The ravioli was rich but daintily stuffed with finely chopped snails, wild nettles and walnuts. A garlic-parsley sauce brought its decadence down a notch. The Australian bartender was so charming, he immediately made me forget that I was there with someone. The Provence team has wisely chosen a small selection of French wines and Belgian beers. The Delirium Nocturnum, a dark ale, was of a maroon-brown color which tasted sweet and cinnamony while the Chateau de Roquefort clairette light and plummy. Provence was already loved by the neighborhood before it closed, but this reincarnation surely puts it on the MacDougal map. Related post/s: Guess which restaurant also carries a MacDougal address?

When I want to prepare something quick but substantial, I always turn to Asian noodles. You can see me at Sobaya slurping my soba noodles most Sunday afternoons. Before Honmura An closed, it was the best place to watch a Japanese soba maker perform his art. But it was in Chicago where I first tasted a soba dish tossed like a salad with vegetables and mushrooms. Four years later, I can still remember how Anna made it for the Dr. and me. In some small way, I wanted to bring back the old with the new by making this familiar recipe the first for this new Web address. For my take, I used carrots and sweet peas. They complemented the soba's buckwheat color. Soba is one reason why dried mushrooms are great to have in your pantry. You can just soak them in warm water a few minutes before you need to use them. The nori, or dried seaweed, provided an extra crunch. You can make this dish your own by adding any of your favorite vegetables; just julienne them for a prettier presentation. Ingredients: soba noodles dried shiitake mushrooms 1 small carrot, peeled and julienned a handful of sweet peas, roughly chopped 2 stalks of scallions, finely chopped nori, or dried Japanese seaweed sesame seeds, toasted sesame oil rice vinegar light soy sauce 1. If using dried mushrooms, soak shiitake in a bowl of warm water for thirty minutes. After soaking, drain shiitake mushrooms and squeeze out excess water using a paper towel. Slice in strips. Set aside. 2. In a small bowl, mix equal parts sesame oil, soy sauce and rice vinegar. 3. Cook soba noodles in boiling water for about 5 minutes. When done, drain and fluff with a fork to keep the noodles from sticking together. 4. Pour sesame sauce little by little over soba noodles. Toss with the mushrooms and the vegetables. Mix in sesame seeds and crushed nori. Top with chopped scallions. Related post/s: Where to buy soba noodles and nori Soba with peanut butter? Or else just go to Sobaya

I was in front of my laptop all day. I was hungry and all I could find in the fridge were chicken thighs and some leftover vegetables. I was too lazy to brown them, less make a fuss and do something fancy, so I peeled and cut some carrots and leeks and made a bed of them in a large pot. I added some onions and garlic with the rosemary sprigs sitting prettily in the fridge kept alive by Glad Press'n Seal. Should be good for about an hour in the oven, I thought, and I went back to my work. When the oven timer beeped-I have burned many meals without it-I transfered the pot on top of the stove and let it simmer. There was something missing. I looked in the pantry and thought of making curry, but I really wanted the broth to be more soupy than saucy. I found the bottle of pomegranate molasses I bought after Tyler introduced me to it. I added a tablespoon at first and it gave the broth a lemony kick. I decided to add some more, adjusting it with some more salt and red pepper flakes, until I was happy with the taste. Ingredients: 6 chicken thighs 1 large carrot, peeled and cut into 1-inch strips 1 leek, white part only, rinsed well, cut in half and then lengthwise 1 small red onion, peeled and quartered 4 cloves garlic, peeled and crushed 1 cup chicken stock, divided in two 1/4 cup pomegranate molasses rosemary sprigs salt red pepper flakes 1. Preheat oven to 450º. Rinse chicken thighs and pat dry. 2. Scatter carrots, leeks, onions and garlic in a large Dutch oven. Lay chicken thighs over vegetables. Pour 1/2 cup stock over chicken and sprinkle with rosemary, salt and red pepper flakes. Place pan in oven and roast for 40 minutes. When chicken and vegetables are cooked, transfer to stove over medium-high heat. 3. Add remaining stock and the pomegranate molasses. Let simmer while seasoning to taste.

333 Hudson Street corner of Charlton 212/633.9333 $300 for fifteen without drinks, with tip ♥ Update, 2008: Dani is now closed and only available for special events. Dani looked promising as soon as we walked in. Its space on Hudson is so airy and spacious, it made me wonder why other restaurants just don't move to the West Village. I booked a table during lunch for a big group. They told me over the phone that our tables will be separated in two groups but assured me that they will be next to each other. When we were all seated, we occupied an L-shaped corner but with an empty table in between the two groups. We asked the maitre'd to move the place settings one table over so that we can be together but she never returned to fulfill our request. So there we ate, two groups side by side, separated by a small table in between, standing to pass plates of appetizers from one table to the next. The lunch menu is very simple with a good selection of sandwiches and salads. There are also some hearty fares like my super al dente orecchiette with lamb or my co-worker's pasta al forno with smoked mozarella and sausage. A tuna special was deemed mediocre by another co-worker which was curious because I've only seen him eat fried chicken during lunch times. Their prix fixe was a good deal with a small bowl of soup, salad and a panini, but those who ordered the paninis alone all disliked the pasta dough chips served on the side. Dani provides a nice space for big parties, but its staff needs to loosen up to accommodate even those who do not order booze during the day and work a little harder for the 20% tip they automatically add to group checks.

34 Downing Street off Bedford 212/691.0404 $86 for two with four beers and a glass of wine, with tip ♥ ♥ ♥ So there's Blue Ribbon Sushi and Blue Ribbon Brasserie on Sullivan; the Blue Ribbon Bakery on Bedford and Blue Ribbon Market around the corner. Of course, there's the other brasserie in Brooklyn. I wasn't surprised when I heard the Bromberg brothers have opened Blue Ribbon Bar on Downing Street because they have been in the business even before the Lambs started taking over the East Village and way before David Chang started attracting other chefs at his restaurant during its after-hours. What I like about any of the Blue Ribbons is that they go past the food trends. People who still wait in line are most likely customers who have been following the empire for the last ten years. I know that when I go, I will get more than just a decent, civilized meal; that I'll get a tried dish that only a select few will appreciate. It's their dependable reputation that made me order the pickled tongue, the wild mushrooms with sweetbreads and the steak tartare with capers. I like that a restaurant, even a tight bar space, will be adventurous enough to offer those items. I like it even better when they can do them right. The pickled tongue, which reminded me of wd-50, was so tender that it made me happy to be eating it even as it discombobulated after a bite. The steak tartare was classically Blue Ribbon and put in mind one of my favorites from their roster, roasted bone marrow with oxtail marmalade. The mushrooms were so fragrant that my companion didn't mind the sweetbreads even after I told him what they really were. They have a great wine list and less expensive flights for their sparkling wines, Pinots and Reislings. It's also the same reputation that makes their employees less obnoxious-I was going to use an eight-letter word starting with an \"a\"-than other waitstaff in the city. Our bartender was very accommodating even after more people squeezed in and he never forgot us sitting in the corner, refilling our water glasses and serving us a complementary flight of wine after already several drinks.

Where to eat in Las Vegas: Mon Ami Gabi

***CONTENT
I was in Las Vegas for a two-day-long work conference. Everything was set up for us. They took care of our flights, hotels, transportation and food, and everything was done half-aSsed. I didn't think I would hate the idea of a buffet until after the first night's dinner at the Bellagio Buffet. Everything looked liked they've been picked over by the time we sat down at 8pm. The lamb loin was so boring. The chicken was dry. The squid salad was chewy. I walked past the sushi station and the lamps made the fish look so unappetitizing that I didn't even bother. I wondered why everyone makes a big deal of the Bellagio Buffet. The only thing that was worth eating was the quail, which was surprisingly moist, stewed in red wine. The sundae looked promising for dessert, but the taste disappeared as fast as it melted. I looked around me and understood the type of eaters buffets attract. They most likely come from smaller towns that don't have as many food choices as New Yorkers. The buffet to them is a splurge because it's in a nice hotel and they're in the middle of their dream vacation. There were so many choices, but I really would rather have two good courses than fifteen mediocre ones. I had read reviews about the long wait and the view of the Bellagio fountains from Mon Ami Gabi before I left New York. I was adamant to eat something delicious while in Las Vegas so when we finally had some time to ourselves, we took a cab from The Luxor to the Paris Hotel. Mon Ami Gabi, which means \"My Friend Gabi\" in French is tucked next to the Eiffel Tower replica. It was dark when we first walked in and the tiles reminded me of the more intimate bistros in Paris, but then it opened up to an atrium bathed in sunlight. It was too windy to sit outside so our table next to the patio was perfectly situated. If the group of ladies next to us with big hair and white shorts weren't there, it easily could have been Paris. I ordered the potato soup as an appetizer. The chicken broth was subtly flavored and the small potato chunks floated delicately with the chives. The duck confit sat on lentils. The skin of the duck was golden and crispy while the dark meat tenderly came off the bone when poked and nudged with a fork. The fries were a different kind: they were thinly sliced and deep-fried and came with my companions' orders of steak, chicken and salmon sandwiches. Two others ordered the spinach crepe and the lobster bisque. From the looks of their empty plates at the end of our meal, they liked them, too. I visited Las Vegas for the first time three years ago. I had dinner with some friends at Nobu and I remember that the omakase was excellent. Returning this year, I realized that the country's top chefs have at least one branch on the strip and that the food being offered have come a long way in the desert, but the buffets still have a long way to go. Mon Ami Gabi is inside the Paris Hotel, 3655 Las Vegas Boulevard. Call 702/967.7999 to make reservations for dinner inside the restaurant. Otherwise, there is a long wait for the tables outside where diners have the view of the Bellagio Fountains.

222 Lafayette Street between Spring and Broome Streets 212/343.3236 $90 for three with Birch beer and two glasses of sparkling wine, without tip ♥ ♥ Ed McFarland, another Pearl Oyster Bar graduate, has opened up his own seafood restaurant and rawbar. (Ex Pearl partner, Mary, left to open Mary's Fish Camp.) The location is great because it's quite hard to find a decent place to eat in SoHo without straying away from Broadway. Ed's Lobster Bar is narrow in front and opens up in the back. There is wainscoting on the walls and bricks are painted white. The space and the menu reminded me of the many seafood places I've tried during drives around New England. Three of us were seated in the back during its opening weekend where it was busy and pretty tight. We were next to the bathroom and the kitchen but the collective buzz contributed to a happier ambiance than not. Press writeups laud the lobster rolls and everyone around us ordered them, but I just couldn't get into all that mayo even after picking the fresh lobster pieces in it. The fries were a bit soggy and I ended up pushing the boring greens that came with it. The best thing on the plate were the homemade pickles. They were perfectly salty and briny. I know I'll be back for a jar of them and skip the $19 roll altogether. All those years visiting New England never taught me what proper clam chowder is. I liked Ed's version because it was runnier, but my companion told me she would have prefered it chunkier, Brooklyn style. We also ordered three oysters from Blue Point and three from Pine Islands. They were fresh, sweet and salty just like the ocean. We would have appreciated the scallops better if we weren't painfully full because they tasted like they were seared in glorious bacon fat. We had visited two other places beforehand, so we called it an early night as if we were actually in New England. Related post/s: Mary's Fish Camp Brooklyn-style clam chowder

We've seen the old city. We've seen the new city. We've hiked several volcanoes. It was time to go to the beach and spend our remaining days in Nicaragua on Little Corn Island. After a quick flight from Managua to Big Corn via Bluefields, we waited for a couple of hours for the boat that took us to Little Corn. At the docks, one of the locals asked us and a Canadian couple to follow him after he heard that we all wanted to stay at Derek's Place-this small paradise on the island with only a short description in our guide books. (We didn't know then that you could go to the dive shop at the docks and ask for availability. They can radio almost anyone on the island to save you from trekking through the forest yourself.) With our backpacks on and the humidity like Times Square in July, the trek to Derek's Place was tiring. When we finally got there, we found out that there was only one hut available. They only have four huts on their property and you basically have to wait and see. We introduced ourselves to the Canadian couple and shared the hut for the first night. The next day, we lucked out when another hut was vacated-we felt more at home the next two nights. Derek's Place is nice; there's no other word to describe it. Derek first came to the island when he was young and returned when he decided to leave California. He met his Catalunyan wife, Anna, a bit later and she followed him to the island. They have two young kids and they've since made their living by welcoming travelers from all over the world to their huts. I've stayed in plenty of huts the last six years, but none were as beautifully built for $25 a night. Colored bottles emit glow when the moonlight hits them at night. The shared bathroom has a giant wok for a sink and the shared shower room reminded me of Caves Branch in Belize from a trip a few years ago. Derek likes to cook so we had very good dinners for three nights. During the day, we would eat the same usual fare: fried chicken and fried fish with plantains bought from the small shacks by the docks. But for dinner, Derek served us everything from conch and shrimp salads, to pasta with shiitake mushrooms, to fish broth to curry to smoked snapper and jack. The Dr. and I also drank the coldest beers on the island because of their windmill and solar power. We even finished a bottle of wine and rum in two days just by sitting around the fire at night. During the day, when we weren't reading our books or sleeping on the hammocks, we walked to and from the docks to look for food, rented bikes to circle the island, swam and sunbathe on different beaches. Little Corn may be little, but it had so much to offer big city dwellers like us. You can imagine how difficult it was to leave. On our way back to catch our flight to New York, we decided to stay on Big Corn Island instead of Managua. There was an unmistakable feeling that, once upon a time, Big Corn Island was the center of it all. Walking around the island felt eery. Somehow, I kept thinking of Gabriel Garcia Marquez's words and imagining the ghosts of the island's past. As we walked around and witnessed empty lobster traps strewed on the side of the road, buildings left in ruins, and a dry swamp with mangroves clinging to dear life, Big Corn Island instantly became a ghost town; a place that was once full of life. We stayed at Anastasia's on the Sea, a sound recommendation from the dive shop on Little Corn. It was a long way, but a pretty drive especially when the road started to hug the sea. Coconut trees leaned and followed the warm wind, while anchored boats floated in the water. Our room at Anastasia's came with two beds, satellite TV, and private bathroom for the same price as our hut at Derek's. Our door opened up to a porch with small steps to the shallow water. Anchovies swayed with the waves like blades of grass. The view was incredible: infinite turquoise waters and a wooden bridge which connected the hotel to their bar and restaurant on stilts. But after closer inspection, Anastasia, with the rest of the island, became antiquated before our eyes and just became eery. (And I was sober.) The cheesy fish and shell decor in the hallway was a much better choice than bustling Managua, but something was amiss. It was time to go home.

It felt like spring, so imagine how perplexed I was when I saw that there were only a few tents set up in the farmers' market. I suppose if the market was crowded, I would have missed the group of men gathered around a small table. Men? Shopping? I squeezed myself in just as the last smoked trout was bought, but saw that there were still some fresh fish inside the giant coolers. Dave Harris of Max Creek Hatchery told me that his fish were still swimming until 7pm the previous night. He introduced me to the rainbow trout which had some purple tints on its scales, and to the brook trout which had some yellow polka-dots. He told me he prefers the brook trout, but both were very pretty that I ended up buying them to cook and compare during dinner. Ooh, pretty, was the Dr.'s reaction when I told him over the phone that I bought trout from the market. He loves to fish and he loves eating them even more, and trout was what he was pining for when we were driving past the river in Oregon. When he came over, he brought with him a bottle of a 2006 Sauvignon Blanc Semillon Australian wine. We drank while he got to work: he put a sliver of butter inside each of the fish with some garlic cloves. He lightly coated them with flour and sprinkled them with salt and pepper. He fried them in hot oil until they were both golden brown and crispy. With some of the leftover frying oil, he sautéed some mushrooms in a skillet and tossed them with arugula and rice wine vinegar dressing. I was surprised that the brook trout tasted like salmon. Its meat was orange and sweet. The rainbow trout was like any fried white fish-a little less exciting but would have been great with green mango salad. Ingredients: 1 fresh brook trout, cleaned 1 fresh rainbow trout, cleaned half a stick of butter, thinly sliced 1 cup of flour 6 garlic cloves, thinly sliced salt, pepper, frying oil 1. Insert garlic and butter in trout's cavity. Season the inside of the fish with salt and pepper. Combine flour, salt and pepper and coat trout. 2. In a skillet, heat oil and fry trout until golden brown on one side. Use tongs to gently turn and cook the other side until golden brown, too. Do not cover. Remove each each fish to a plate lined with paper towel when cooked. Related post/s: Union Square Greenmarket

I like assembling my own pizza at home. I say assemble rather than bake because I buy my pizzettas from Sullivan Street Bakery. I've tried their ciabatta bread and their focaccia with rosemary, but my favorite would be their light pizza bianca. A pizza square good for three people costs about $2. I used some ingredients I already had in my fridge. For olive oil, I used the shiso oil I made. Instead of goat cheese, I finished the sheep's milk cheese I picked up with my lamb earlier in the week. Of course, you can put anything and everything on your own pizzetta. Ingredients: 1 square of pizza bianca or focaccia bread 4 slivers of pancetta fresh arugula, rinsed, pat dry 1 small pear, sliced thinly a handful of bella mushrooms, wiped clean, sliced 1 small red onion, finely chopped sheep's milk cheese or goat cheese 2 tbsp balsamic vinegar olive oil 1. Preheat oven at 350º. In the meantime, heat some oil in a skillet, sauté onions and mushrooms with the balsamic vinegar. Cook for about 10 minutes or until mushrooms are soft. 2. Prepare pizzetta on a baking sheet wrapped in aluminum foil. On the bread, lay the arugula and top with pancetta, pears and mushrooms. Drizzle some olive oil. 3. Bake in oven for 20 minutes, enough to cook the pancetta and toast the bread.

747 Saint Nicholas Avenue between 146th and 147th Streets 212/491.5518 $12 for two fish and chips, take-away ♥ Harlem is far away from England, but Devin's fish and chips come close to a good snack on a lazy and gloomy weekend afternoon. For $6, you can eat or take away three pieces of lightly breaded fish, red snapper or whiting, with a handful of fries. They don't have malt vinegar but there's tartar and Tabasco sauce. We bought two and sat down on the stools in the narrow space inside while people stood in line to wait for their turn to order. The other customers were ordering everything from broiled whole fish to calamari to crab claws. While we waited, we discovered that the store across the street had some of the best beer selections in West Harlem. We bought two bottles of Smithwick's and drank them wrapped in paper while we ate our fish and chips. Sometimes, the neighborhood pulls through.

25 Clinton Street between Houston and Stanton 212/253.2900 $180 for four people with three carafes of sake and two beers, without tip ♥ ♥ I didn't expect to save money during Japanese Restaurant Week. Every restaurant week promo I've managed to attend always sounded better than what I actually ended up experiencing. The discounted menus during restaurant week are usually subpar, with the least expensive ingredients being offered. I've been content with some of the prix fixes I've ordered, but what to drink with them? My bill just always adds up in the end. I booked a table at Sachiko's to take advantage of the week-long event, but not once was I reminded by the restaurant's staff. On my way out, I saw printed menus on the bar with a 10% coupon attached to them. Even if they told me about Japanese Restaurant Week, my discount would have been, at most, $18. I doubt I ordered anything that was eligible for the discount anyway. For $20, you can get at least three slivers of seven types of fish-that's a whole lot of fish! It was the better choice because nothing in the a la carte menu was different. The eel wrapped in rice paper was a bit boring, and the kushiage, breaded and deep-fried meat and seafood assortment, although lighter, was similar to anything I've eaten before that's been breaded and deep-fried. My favorite was the soy and egg \"soup\" with uni, a delicate concoction of soft tofu, egg and sea urchin. Scooping up the tofu and having the uni softly collapse in my mouth were most pleasurable. At Sachiko's, the sashimi was pretty good, the sake choices even better.

I was at the market already so it was pretty hard to resist the lamb chops from 3-Corner Field Farm. It's lambing season soon and they won't be back in the market until June. I picked up four chops that cost $30 with a big knob of sheep's milk cheese covered in herbs de Provence. The lamb was just slaughtered and packed immediately-I could tell as soon as I unwrapped them at home. Unlike the chops I buy from my neighborhood grocery store, the meat hasn't been in storage for a long time and it tasted like it, too. I cook a lot of lamb at home. I've cooked it with Indian spices. I've served it with corn pudding. I've tried it the Julia Child way. This time, I wanted to keep it simple. I mixed some olive oil and balsamic vinegar with minced garlic and fresh rosemary and brushed it on the chops. I broiled them for about ten minutes per side. They were done as soon as I poked them-soft, but firm. (Remember the meat of your palm right below your thumb.) I took them out of the oven and let them sit for five more minutes to finish cooking while I tossed some greens with the sheep's milk cheese. We finished a bottle of red Loire wine with it. Ingredients: 3 grass-fed lamb chops 5 garlic cloves, minced 3 sprigs of rosemary 1 cup balsamic vinegar salt, pepper, olive oil 1. Preheat oven to 350º. In the meantime, combine all the ingredients in a large bowl and marinate the lamb chops in it. 2. When ready to cook, roast lamb chops for 10 minutes per side. They're perfect when the meat feels like the palm right below your thumb. Remove from oven to a chopping block and let rest for five minutes.

I tip-toed on freshly-fallen snow at the farmers' market to buy some grass-fed beef. I stopped by the New York Beef Company tent and met John to ask about what he was offering. My hands were already cold, but I looked through his frozen bags to buy the best-looking steak I can get for dinner. I know everyone's been on the grass-fed wagon already but unfortunately, I find food items with organic or sustainable or grass-fed or free-range labels expensive. If you're like me, then you also buy food items at least once a week. They all add up to a very expensive grocery bill each month. Plus, the only farmers' market easily accessible to me is the one at Union Square, and even though I work downtown, I find it a hassle to stop by. The New York Beef sells 100% grass-fed steak, prime rib, roasts and other fine cuts of beef. I got a nice steak for about $22. The Dr. covered it with some salt, pepper and minced garlic and broiled both sides until it was tender-poke the meat of your palm below your thumb; that's how it should feel for medium-rare-and we ate it with oyster mushrooms sauteed in goose fat served on a bed of arugula and mixed greens. A bottle of Cabernet was the perfect match. I realized later that it was John who left me a message last year when I spent $14 on a piece of sirloin steak from Dean & Deluca. If he's reading this, I hope he's proud. His beef not only looked beautiful, it was delicious, too. Ingredients: 1 beef steak 6 garlic cloves, minced salt, pepper, olive oil 1. Massage beef steak with all the other ingredients. 2. When ready to cook, broil beef steak in oven set to high until medium-rare. They’re perfect when the meat feels like the palm right below your thumb. Remove from oven to a chopping block and let rest for five minutes. Related post/s: Where to get grass-fed beef steak

I was listening to the controversies surrounding clarklewis over a round of cocktails. The owners were the stars of Portland's food scene until they divorced which resulted in two of their restaurants closing. Some thought clarklewis was too loud and too dark when it first opened, but there are still the fanatics who remain loyal and still frequent the restaurant's supper events even with all the new choices cropping up in the area. It remains one of Sam and Jenny's favorites, so they booked a table for the six of us our first night in Portland. I first reacted to the space because it used to be an old warehouse along Water Avenue. It reminded me of the small galleries that moved out of Manhattan and rented open spaces for less money in DUMBO, Brooklyn. I've always liked that unfinished industrial look. As soon as we were seated, I turned to look around me and I immediately liked the buzz. It wasn't too loud and it sounded like everyone else was having a good time. The menu consisted of very simple choices. There were familiar salads and pasta dishes that already sounded good on paper. We decided to get several half orders of them to share with the entire table, but by the time they were served, there was hardly any sharing going around. We all wanted to claim our own. The duck and parmesan salad was excellent. You can't go wrong with fresh produce and good cheese peppered with small pieces of roasted duck. The endives were slathered with brown sugar which made them sweet, but at the same time very nutty. The fennel salad with the navel oranges and olives was by far my favorite. The bowl of clams was deliciously hearty. I was using the sausage-flavored broth as dip for the bread. If we didn't run out of bread on the table, I would have been set for the night. The lamb chops were to die for. I had the same dish the previous night at Celilo, but my craving wasn't fulfilled until we cleaned our plates. I found the broccoli an uninspiring accompaniment, however, but fortunately, Dave's tagliatelle and Carmie's beef stew in pasta filled us all up. A bottle of Italian wine was a good compliment to everything we ordered and our choices of desserts were the perfect end to a long, satisfying meal with friends. clarklewis is at 1001 SE Water Avenue in Portland, Oregon. Call 503/235.2294 for reservations. They are closed on Sundays and Mondays. Related post/s: Eating in Hood River, Oregon: Celilo

I figured as much, Ian said, after I told him I was from New York City. Each sushi on the menu was priced at $2. Two dollars! I'm used to paying $5 a piece and up to $11 for an otoro, so you can imagine the kind of gasp I let out that elicited such a comment from Ian, the sushi chef. We had three hours before our flight back to the concrete jungle, so Sam decided to take us to one of his favorite sushi places in Portland before driving us to the airport. Three of us sat at the sushi bar in the back and ordered the omakase with several kinds of sake. Ian performed the rest of the night. Pine nuts gave the tombo tuna tartare more texture. Lotus root chips and endives were used to scoop them up. If sports bars served snacks like this, I'd be watching more sports. Next came the tuna and salmon carpaccio with finely chopped shiso leaf and a cute toasted garlic sliver on top. I was surprised at how the garlic gave a nice kick to the big pieces of sashimi. The amberjack was folded like a fortune cookie, served with chives and chili threads. Just a touch of sweet soy gave the fish its needed moisture. The salmon sushi was just salmon sushi and the yellowtail was just yellowtail, but that may be why Ian thought about making the next dish so complicated: he spiced up some octopus, wrapped it in seaweed, wrapped that in tuna and topped everything with tobiko. When I thought we were done, the Dr. asked to taste the scallops. So Ian created a big roll for him while he indulged me with the most decadent shot of sake I've ever had-it had swimming oyster, uni and raw quail egg in it. (That was for the reader who told me to try oyster shooter the next time I get a chance.) As usual, we ended with a maki of shiso leaf to cleanse the palate, but Sam opted for the French toast with maple syrup and whipped cream. Sam thought he was also on vacation. There was nothing sublime about the fish at Yakuza but everything was fresh and beautifully cut. Ian gave us his complete attention during our time at the sushi bar and made us visitors feel like there's no reason to go back home. At less than $190 for all the fish we ate and all the sake we drank, even I couldn't complain. Did I already say that the west coast is starting to become more appealing? Yakuza is at 5411 NE 30th Avenue in Portland, Oregon. We walked in without reservations, but for busier nights, call 503/450.0893. Related post/s: Eating in Portland, Oregon: clarklewis

After a half-day of snowboarding for the first time in two years, we were famished. Next to the Oak Street Hotel was Brian's Pourhouse. It came recommended by the front desk, but we decided to skip it after we noticed the TV at the bar. Across the street was Three Rivers Grill. We crossed to check out the menu but stopped halfway after we saw the large sign up front: \"Buy one steak, get another free. Wednesday nights.\" During our drive down from Mt. Hood, I remembered seeing a restaurant that looked nice, so I coerced the Dr. to walk a few more blocks to check it out. (Our legs were sore, so walking took some convincing.) As soon as we saw that there were lamb chops on the menu, we walked in Celilo. We knew we wanted a local Pinot Noir. We only ordered half of the Elk Cove because we wanted to start with a dirty martini-the Dr.'s latest drink-and the pear-flavored champagne, described as \"pure Oregon in a glass\". We started with half a dozen of the oysters. A year ago, there was a warning not to eat oysters from the Pacific Northwest. I haven't heard any bad news since then but they were as salty and sweet as I remember them. The pear and walnut salad was hefty, just the way I like my salads. And the lamb? Much better than I expected. The chops came with braised shoulder, which made the dish more than perfect for winter. For dessert, we stuck with our usual pick, a tart tarte (ha!), a homemade combination of huckleberry filling and vanilla ice cream. The service was nice. There's just no other way to describe the attitude of food servers outside New York City. I can call them \"slow\", but I know that's unfair since New York is the only city I've been that's in a perpetual hurry. Regardless of the place, when I ask for medium-rare, I expect medium-rare. Celilo fulfilled everything we asked for except the dirty in the Dr.'s martini, but at $104 for two including tip, I turn most of the Cia off. I play nice in return. The martini stayed clean. Celilo Restaurant and Bar is at 16 Oak Street in Hood River, Oregon. We walked in without reservations, but during busy season, call 541/386.5710. Related post/s: Eating in Portland, Oregon: Yakuza

Jetblue had a nice sale to the west coast, so we took advantage of the promotion and paid $250 each for round-trip tickets to Oregon. Portland was on my list of places to visit this year and the Dr. really wanted to go snowboarding, so we spent a long weekend with friends even though the state's been in the news lately, lost hikers and all. Late Thursday night, we arrived in Portland and stayed at Sam and Jenny's house near the Japanese Garden. Sam was still at work but Jenny had a pot of chigae waiting with Fat Tire beers, so we stayed up a bit and talked. It's hard to say no to Korean food especially when it's pouring outside. We slept very well and woke up the next day to catch up with Sam and meet their new baby, Ella, who babbled and smiled the entire morning. After a bit of catching up, we loaded our boards and drove their Hybrid SUV up to Mt. Hood. We stopped by a small town to get gas where we also picked up some greasy taquitos for lunch. It was raining when we were driving up, but it turned into fluffy, white snow when we reached the forest. It was absolutely Christmas-like. The pine trees were all covered in white and the snow didn't show any signs of stopping. It was almost two when we bought our half-day tickets ($49 each!) but we were able to board until it started to get dark. Visibility was low when we were on the lifts, but on top of the mountain, there was no wind. Past the fog, our runs were clear. I was still rusty but it only took one run for my adrenaline to start pumping. I forgot how much fun snowboarding could be. I've never experienced snow like that before in the east coast. Even though I fell on my ass a couple of times, the powder made falling down fun. I was more comfortable turning because I knew ice wasn't going to scrape me and I wasn't freezing my teeth off with every try. We were sore after the first day but it made for a good night of cocktails, Oregon Pinot Noir and lamb chops at Celilo. On Saturday, we woke up from a deep slumber with the sun out. The mountain was already crowded by the time we started at 11am. The faster kids were speeding by us in their short-sleeved T-shirts. Meanwhile, I was sweating like a pig and trying to get out of a deep ditch of fresh snow. The easy run that the Dr. wanted us to try felt like a marathon. We lasted about four hours before we finally called it a day and drove back to Portland to meet up with Sam and Jenny, plus Dave and Carmie, who drove in from Seattle to join us. This is hard to admit, but the west coast is starting to become more appealing. Where we stayed in Hood River, an hour drive up Mt.

I was doing my grocery shopping in Chinatown when I came across a pack of extra small chicken drumsticks. About a dozen pieces were tightly packed for about $1.50. At home, I opened them up and realized they weren't chicken thighs but the other half of chicken wings-the arms, I call them. I had two packs, 24 pieces in all, and I immediately thought I'd just deep-fry and snack on them. But the temperature outside dropped and the weather called for a thick stew. This recipe requires a lot of ingredients, but fortunately, I already had them in my pantry. If you don't have chicken and spinach, chickpeas alone make a satisfying meal, as long as it's cooked in bacon. Just skip the step with the chicken and spinach and top with a fried egg. Ingredients: 12 pieces chicken wings, halved, rinsed and pat dry with a paper towel 4 strips of bacon half a bag of chickpeas, soaked overnight 1 bag of baby spinach, rinsed 2 cups chicken broth juice from half a lemon zest from half a lemon 1 garlic clove, minced 1 tsp red pepper flakes 1 small onion, thinly sliced 1 tbsp cumin, grounded 1 tsp paprika 1 tsp cinnamon powder 1 tbsp all-purpose flour 1 tbsp honey a knob of butter a handful of cilantro, roughly chopped salt and pepper 1. Sprinkle chicken wings with salt and pepper. In a large Dutch oven, render fat from bacon until golden brown. Add butter. Brown chicken wings on both sides. Remove chicken from pot and set aside. 2. In the same pot, sauté garlic and onions. Add the chick peas and the chicken broth. Bring to a boil and then lower the heat. Cover and simmer for 25 minutes to cook chickpeas. 3. When broth is slightly reduced and chickpeas are tender, add the rest of the ingredients. Add back the chicken wings. Cook for an extra 5 minutes or until spinach is wilted. Mix well and season to taste. Related post/s: I love my chickpeas Inspired by The Food of Spain and Portugal at Amazon.com

At the New York Times Travel Show, I watched Chef Prudhomme make gumbo. I've never been to New Orleans, but I've always been curious about homemade Louisiana cooking. We recently got a fresh dump of snow in New York City and gumbo was just the right dish to eat for dinner. The secret here is the roux, a mixture of wheat flour and fat. Roux is the basis of French sauces and most Louisiana cooking; burn it and you have to start over. I added bacon to this recipe to use the last installment of bacon I received as a birthday present. I made enough to give back to the lovely people who thought about giving it to me in the first place. Ingredients: 6 pieces chicken drumsticks 3 pieces of andouille sausage, cut into 1/4-inch-thick slices 5 slices of bacon, chopped in small pieces 1 cup all-purpose flour 1 medium onion, chopped 1 red bell pepper, chopped 4 celery ribs, chopped a handful of okra, cut into smaller pieces 1 small can of diced tomatoes 5 cloves of garlic chicken broth 3 tbsps Creole seasoning 2 sprigs of fresh thyme 4 bay leaves hot sauce vegetable oil salt, pepper 1. Make roux. In a large skillet, heat vegetable oil in medium heat until somewhat smoking. Pour flour and mix with a whisk. Keep mixing for about 15 minutes or until flour is red-orange. This roux is your base. If black spots start to appear in the flour, it means you've burnt it. You have to start over. Remove from heat and add all the vegetables and the spices. Keep mixing with the whisk to help cool down the roux. Set aside. 2. In a large Dutch oven, render the fat from the bacon. Remove the bacon to a plate. Using the fat, brown the chicken drumsticks. Remove chicken to a plate. 3. Using the same fat and adding a little more oil as necessary, brown the sausages. Add the broth and the tomatoes and add back the chicken, the bacon and the roux. 4. Simmer and cook the chicken while ocassionally mixing to make sure it doesn't dry up. Add more stock as necessary and adjust to taste using salt, pepper and hot sauce. Add the okra and cook until tender the last 10 minutes.

We left Morgan's Rock feeling a little spoiled. The manager gave us a ride to San Juan which helped us save $60. From San Juan, we got on a cab to the Rivas bus station. Along the way, we were stopped by some cops doing routine inspection. All six of us showed our IDs and passports. (The car fit four comfortably, but of course, the driver made six people fit.) When I asked the lady next to me why the inspection was necessary, she mentioned that drugs from Costa Rica are smuggled through San Juan. Her nail polish was peeling and her denim skirt was two sizes too small for her. I wished the cops would check her ID more carefully. In Rivas, we had an hour to kill before the bus to Managua was scheduled to depart. Kids were constantly asking us to buy food and drinks from them. We didn't need to buy food because the staff at Morgan's Rock packed us a couple of sandwiches for lunch and even gave me ceviche in a Ziploc. I ended up paying one of the boys 5 cordovas to walk me inside the food market and direct me to the public bathroom, though. He also asked one of the vendors for a plastic fork so that we could eat our ceviche. The ride was, as usual, bumpy and loud, but we made it back to Managua safely. At Oscar Fonseca's house, we unpacked before we walked around the neighborhood to look for dinner. If you're planning a trip to Nicaragua, I recommend to skip this sooty city. There wasn't really anything exciting about it. To our delight, we saw a Pollo Campero sign near one of the rotundas, a chicken fast food place we learned about while in El Salvador. We cabbed it to the main park but there was nothing there except an old church and a fountain. Before heading back home, we stopped by a fruit stand to buy a whole watermelon. That night, feeling a little disappointed with our experience with Nicaragua's volcanoes so far, we decided to postpone our flight to the Caribbean coast and stay one more day in Managua to make a day trip to León, home of Cerro Negro, or the Black Hill. The next morning, we woke up very early to catch the 5:30am shuttle van to León, Nicaragua's \"intellectual\" city. It only took an hour to get there because half of the country was still asleep, but it took almost two hours before we could find a restaurant open for business. I was so grouchy when we finally found breakfast at Comedor Lucia that I ordered a chicken leg with my scrambled eggs. After eating, we met up with Hector at the Va Pues Tour office inside the Cocinarte restaurant-cum-artist hangout. It was a last-minute arrangement and we couldn't risk just asking one of the locals for a much cheaper ride to Cerro Negro, so we ended up shelling out $90 for the two of us to hike the crater. We got on the pickup truck and our driver negotiated the dry mud along the way while Hector told us about his life. He was young and energetic and seemed really thrilled that Chinese-looking people like us could speak Spanish. It was a long drive and we only saw one sign directing us towards the volcano. We tried to convince ourselves that we made the right decision in paying so much money to get us there. As soon as we started our hike up Cerro Negro, I knew it was going to be a completely different experience from Mombacho or Apoyo. The small stones crunched as we stepped on them. It was like hiking on powdered snow: step up, crunch, slide down, repeat. From afar, we could see how much damage the lava from its last eruption affected the valley. There was no vegetation, only hardened asphalt. Steam was coming out from some of the rocks. I scooped up some to take home as souveneir and was amazed at how hot they were. One section of the hill was completely covered in yellow sulphur. It was really windy when we reached the top. But the crater was right below us and it was an amazing sight. (Okay, so the $90 was worth it.) Now, this is a crater, I thought. Weirdly enough, crickets and grasshoppers were hopping all over the place. The heat attracted them, but they would die instantly when they would land on the steaming rocks for too long. After several photographs from the top, we readied ourselves for what was to come next: sliding and surfing down the other side of Cerro Negro. If we paid a little more money, we could have rented mini-boards to suit up and ride down like snowboarders. But we just decided to slide down without any props. It was longer than I expected but it was so much fun. The stones gave easily and I couldn't help but squeal every time I slid without interruption. I imagined our entire surrounding was how the moon would look like. Everything was black and pure. I've never seen anything like Cerro Negro before and I've definitely never slid down a volcano in my life. Back in León, we walked to the market to look for lunch. It was so hot, we were the only ones out on the streets. Inside the market, we saw several ladies serving up homecooked meals to the locals. It was my self-imposed rule in Nicaragua: find the fat lady who looks like she can cook as well as she can eat. We picked the largest woman in the group and sat down on one of the plastic chairs with our order. We were sweating when we came down the volcano and we were still sweating while we ate. We still have to go back to Managua at the end of the day but we definitely knew it was time for some beach time.

The bus ride from Granada to Rivas was about two hours. Taxi drivers swarmed as soon as we got off the bus. One of them started to take my backpack. Espera, I said, almost pissed off. Calm down and wait for us to hire one of you before you take our bags. We needed a ride to Morgan's Rock on Bahía Majagual and we heard prices up to $40. I read beforehand that the ride to San Juan was about $18, but because Morgan's Rock is a private hacienda, we negotiated with one of the drivers for $25. Moises followed the blue MR signs on La Chocolata Road for 30 minutes before we reached the security gate. The guard let us in after confirming our reservations and we kept driving through the private forest until we arrived at the main lodge where ice-cold cranberry juice was waiting for us. Staff members in white uniforms and khaki shorts took our bags to deliver them to our room while the manager showed us around. We laughed at ourselves because we've never stayed at a luxury place in Central America. Inspired by the Lapa Rios Ecolodge in Costa Rica, luxury became an understatement the three days we were at the hacienda because it came with impressive responsibility. Morgan's Rock is part of a 1,000-hectare tree farming and reforestation project as well as an 800-hectare private nature reserve. More than a million hardwood and fruit trees have been planted the last five years to bring back the animals native to the Pacific Coast. Howler monkeys woke us up in the middle of the night. Magpie Blue Jays and squirrels joined us for coffee in the mornings. Turtle eggs are monitored and protected on the beach. They have a sugar cane mill where they make their own rum, plus a farm provides food to the staff and the guests. All the wood used to build the bungalows came from responsibly-managed logging sources and tree farming projects in the country to ensure ecological responsibility. The bungalows face west and have a view of the bay or the estuary and they were all designed to shelter guests from all kinds of weather. The designer and architect only used local materials and recycled wood while local artisans created and crafted the furnishings. The bungalows are connected to the main lodge by a 110-meter suspension bridge which was built so that trees weren't unnecessarily cut. We had to climb 184 steps to our #15 bungalow so we made sure we packed everything we needed in the morning. There is no solar power but a bio-filter system was installed for water and the pool only uses natural salt to stay clean. They also built an on-site waste disposal plant and separation system and created a recycling project. Ranchitos or huts sit on the beach to provide respite from the intense sun. A pool with an infinity-style edge is right next to the restaurant and bar. We signed up for a night walk one night with Juan where we saw all kinds of animals in the dark with the help of a flashlight. There were snakes, scorpions, bats, spiders, sleeping birds and butterflies and stinky howler monkeys. (When it started to smell like cow poop, Juan howled to attract them. We ran as soon as they responded because they apparently throw their poop to scare you away.) We also hiked around the forest one morning where we saw a few white-faced monkeys across the shrimp farm. We used the body boards when the waves were strong enough. Unfortunately, the estuary was too dry to kayak and it was too windy in the season to go fishing with the staff. We didn't do much while at Morgan's Rock except truly relax and tune out.

47 Bond Street between Lafayette and Bowery 212/533.1932 $180 for four people with a bottle of wine, without tip ♥ We wanted to eat at Il Buco ever since we walked by one night and took a peek inside. Candles were lit that made the ambiance romantic and rustic at the same time. We just knew that it would be a nice place to sit, eat and drink wine with good company. Four of us finally booked a table one cold, winter night to do exactly just that. We could only get a 6pm table with a week's notice, so we took it. Unfortunately, we were seated right next to the entrance of the wine cellar. Cozy it wasn't. It looked like they were conducting a field trip down the basement. Guests kept walking in and stepping back out and I kept interrupting our table's conversation by pushing the door closed to keep the draft from coming in. Our waitress never made a move to transfer us to an unoccupied table even though the restaurant was not completely full before 8pm. We had to ask the bus boy for more bread and olive oil because our waitress kept forgetting us. But since the bus boy only came by to take our plates away, we never had enough. The menu is Mediterranean, a cuisine that I can enjoy any time, with some Italian specialities. But nothing in the menu made my heart palpitate. The special of the night was braised oxtails on mashed potatoes which I make at home for less than $30. An appetizer portion of baby eels were ordered, only to be canceled when our waitress informed us that it was going to cost us $75. We ended up ordering the octopus with Umbrian chickpeas and parsley, the bass with fresh pomegranate, lime, red chili and cilantro, the cod with fennel, lemon and red onion with mint salsa verde, the fennel-crusted sashimi-grade tuna and the beef carpaccio. The small plates were at least $12 each. They were all delicious but a little hard on the wallet. We also decided to order full plates of the pappardelle with black trumpet mushrooms and the gnocchi. The pasta servings were so small. I can't imagine getting them as half orders. Il Buco is like waking up startled in the middle of a beautiful dream.

As soon as we landed in Managua, we were picked up by Victor and driven about thirty minutes to Granada, the oldest city in Central America and yet the most developed destination in Nicaragua. Our home for three nights was Hospedaje La Siesta on Calle El Almendro, a modest room with private bath for $15 a night owned by a French-Nicaraguan couple awaiting their first child. It was the middle of the day when we checked in. It was hot, and since our flight out of New York was at 6am, we immediately fell asleep. We woke up just before the sun started to set and decided to walk to Parque Central to look for food. Granada had a Oaxacan feel to it. Old buildings repainted in vibrant colors; beat-up sedans co-exist with horse carriages on cobble stone streets. The locals congregated in the park enjoying the warm early night breeze, while street vendors packed up their wares, as if thinking, Tomorrow is another day. We ended up eating at Señora Olga's for dinner. It wasn't a restaurant but a woman grilling chicken on the corner of Avenida Bodan. We ate our plates of barbequed chicken with a mountain of tostones, fried raw plantains, and maduros, fried ripe plantains, with coleslaw (35 cordovas apiece or $2) on plastic tables and chairs. We heard the loud singing from the small church across the street. There were young boys playing football on the other side, screaming, while mangy dogs waited for our leftovers. The lights turned off-a blackout-and for a while, we ate in the dark. We ended up eating at Señora Olga's a second time. To us, it was the best option in Granada, less we chose to eat pizza or pasta. The next day, we woke up early to hike Volcán Mombacho. We passed by the central market in search of breakfast. We stopped by a stall that had a sign on it, Desayuno, Breakfast, and ordered a plate of the gallo pinto: rice, red beans and huevos rancheros, or scrambled eggs with tomatoes and onions. The big lady who ran the show was a bit disappointed that we didn't touch the Jell-O-like tamal on our plates. At Shell Palmira, our foreign-looking selves were guided to a souped-up school bus to Mombacho. The ride took only twenty minutes and the conductor told us when it was time for us to get off. From the highway, we walked about a mile until we reached the Biological Center. We paid our 100 cordovas ($5) to enter the Reserve. One of the uniformed rangers told us that we have to wait for two hours for the shuttle that will take us to the top of the volcano. It was only 8:30am so we decided to hike the almost-vertical concrete path ourselves. Well, the 3,000-feet hike up took us two hours. At the top, we learned that there were two craters, Sendero el Cráter and Sendero la Puma. We were so exhausted from our hike, we only had strength left for the 25-minute walk around Sendero el Cráter and not the estimated 3-hour Puma. Volcán Mombacho is now practically a forest; privately-owned coffee plantations and cattle ranchers cover the rest of the land. From the lookout points, we could see Lake Cocibolca, Nicaragua's largest lake, and Las Isletas, the islets believed to have come from the last major eruption. On our way down, I convinced the Dr. to zipline. We've never done a canopy tour before, so we gave up $50 to belay and zip to fifteen platforms and give ourselves a thrill by doing \"the Superman\" and \"the upside-down.\" The entire course runs 1,500 meters and there was even a hanging (and shaky) rope bridge to cross from one of the platforms. We rappeled from a large ceiba tree 23 meters down to one of the farms to finish. It was beautiful up there. We could see the lake from some of the platforms. The massive trees looked so alive with orchids and ferns growing from their branches. At the end of the course, our guides radioed the base camp and had us picked up. We were given a ride all the way down to the Biological Center, so all we had to do was walk the last 30 minutes to the highway to catch the bus back to Granada. On our last day in Granada, we had breakfast at Nica Buffet, a Dutch-owned restaurant, where we had pancakes and, finally, good coffee. The owner recommended that we sign up with Hostal Oasis to visit Laguna de Apoyo for the day. For about $30, we joined a few other young couples and got on a van to go to Crater's Edge, where we spent the entire day lazing by the lake. It was too hot to do anything; too hot to kayak, too hot to hike, even too hot to sunbathe. The swimming hole is 48 square-kilometers and it's trapped inside the crater of Volcán Apoyo. It's one of the cleanest and deepest (at about 650 feet) lagoons in the country. It got kind of boring after a few hours of sitting prettily. We finished our books under the shade and we were anxious to keep moving. Back in town, we paid $1 each to go up the bell tower of La Merced Church and watch the sun set. We could see everything from up there. The courtyards and the roofs even reminded me of Prague; the church domes of Barcelona. We walked to the malecon and said our goodbyes to Granada as the sun went down like a red-orange yolk.

Now I'm on a smoking binge. The pulled pork was such a success, I decided to smoke some chicken, too. It's from the same article by Dana Bowen in The Times. This didn't require the hickory-wood smoking chips, only ingredients I already had in my pantry. I loved cooking this because it turned out beautifully. The glaze gave the chicken a nice golden color and smoking it made the meat inside silky and juicy. It was perfect with some yellow rice and, you guessed it, pickled scotch bonnet peppers. Ingredients: 1 chicken, cut in half, or in several pieces 2 small oranges 2 tbsps Earl Grey tea 2 cinnamon sticks 5 pods of star anise 1/4 cup hoisin sauce 2 tbsps pomegranate molasses Sriracha chili sauce, to taste salt, pepper, oil 1. Zest one orange and peel the other. Squeeze out juice and save for sauce. Scatter the orange peels on a roasting pan with the tea, cinnamon sticks and anise. Put the rack on top and place the chicken pieces on the rack. Sprinkle chicken with salt and pepper. 2. Place the pan on the stove over medium heat. When it starts to smoke a little, cover with aluminum foil by forming a tent. Smoke for about 25 minutes. Turn off heat and let it rest for 5 minutes, covered. 3. While chicken is smoking, make glaze. In a bowl, combine zest, hoisin, pomegranate molasses and Sriracha. Add some of the orange juice to make sure it's not too thick. Set aside. 4. In a large skillet with some hot oil, cook the chicken until golden brown, about 3 minutes per side. Reduce the heat to low and brush chicken with the glaze using a pastry brush. Cook for a few more minutes until the glaze has browned a little. Related post/s: Crazy for smoking! Match with pickled scotch bonnet peppers

The Dr. called it dedication to my meat. When a friend asked me if I was interested in going out on Saturday, I had to decline. I said I was going to be busy smoking and roasting an eight-pound pork shoulder. I don't know why that sounds funny, but it does, because I think I've come a long way from cooking small dishes. Now I'm roasting a part of a pig with a bone as large as my arm. What's even funnier is that my friend reacted nonchalantly because I know she's heard something similar from me before. I don't think I can say anything anymore that would surprise the people who know me so well. The recipe looked easy enough. It's from an article written by Dana Bowen in The Times. All I had to do was buy a tin can of hickory-wood smoking chips from Zabar's uptown and a large piece of pork from Bayard Meat Market that fit in my tote bag. I love my barbeque, I really do, and if I can produce a good version at home, I'll be happy. Almost six hours later, I was; the entire family was. Serve with toasted rolls and of course, pickled scotch bonnet peppers. Ingredients: 1 8-pound pork shoulder, bone-in 3 tbsps of hickory-wood smoking chips 2 cups of cider vinegar 1 tbsp red pepper flakes 1 tbsp white sugar 1/4 cup brown sugar 1/2 cup ketchup salt and pepper 1. Massage pork with salt and pepper. Scatter the smoking chips at the bottom of the roasting pan. Place the pork on a rack and then on the roasting pan. Cover with two long pieces of aluminum foil, folding them together tightly and forming a closed tent. Make sure there is room for the smoke to circulate between the pork and the foil. Place on stovetop and turn on the heat to medium and smoke pork for 45 minutes. Turn off the heat and rest, covered, for 5 minutes. 2. While pork is smoking, preheat oven to 300º. Whisk the rest of the ingredients in a bowl to make sauce. Season to taste, cover and refrigerate until ready to use. 3. Uncover the roasting pan and transfer it to the oven. Cook for 40 minutes per pound, or about 4 hours, turning the pork over every hour until a meat thermometer inserted into the middle of the pork reads 190º. 4. Remove pork from the oven and rest on a large cutting board for 20 minutes or until cool enough to handle. While still warm, pull meat away from bones and shred chunks of meat into long strands into a bowl. Chop crustier bits into smaller pieces and add to the bowl. Season with some of the sauce and mix well. Related post/s: Smoking with Chicken Match with pickled scotch bonnet peppers Where to buy hickory-wood smoking chips

The couple of days we had TV access while in Nicaragua, I watched a few shows that originally air in the South Pacific. Surfing the Menu features two hot boys who travel, surf and cook. I saw the episode shot in Otago and Canterbury in New Zealand where they roasted pork ribs on the bone. I scribbled on the back of my printed itinerary and promised the Dr. that I will make them for him when we return to the city. Back in Manhattan, I stopped by the Bayard Meat Market in Chinatown and bought two racks of pork ribs for about $10 to keep my promise. The result? Succulent pork ribs good for four people and even better with pickled scotch bonnet peppers. Ingredients: 2 racks of pork ribs 2 lemongrass stalks, smashed, 1 stalk sliced in an angle and in small pieces 5 cloves ginger, minced a small knob of ginger, peeled, thinly sliced a small bunch of thyme peanut oil 1/2 cup maple syrup 2 tbsps hoisin sauce 1/4 cup honey salt and pepper 1. Marinate the roast. Rub the roast with salt and pepper. Make small incisions all over the roast using a small knife and insert the garlic, ginger and lemongrass slivers in them. Rub the roast in peanut oil and place it in large glass pan with leftover ginger, lemongrass, garlic and the thyme. Marinate overnight. 2. When ready to cook, preheat the oven at 350º. Take the roast out and let sit in room temperature while making the baste. In a bowl, mix maple syrup, hoisin sauce and honey. Set aside. 3. Place the roast, bone side down, in a large roasting tray, and roast for about 20 minutes, turning over halfway. Using the other lemongrass stalk as a brush, baste every few minutes. Cook until you can insert a knife in the roast and the liquid that comes out is clear. Related post/s: Pickled Scotch Bonnet peppers Two racks of pork ribs for less

It always tempts us: that clear, glass jar stuffed with peppers, carrots and onions, drowned in vinegar. We know it's going to hurt, but it's one of those things we can't help but eat when we're on some island in Central America. The coasts of Belize, Costa Rica and most recently, Nicaragua, reminded us that African slaves were imported by the Spanish to fulfill their labor needs. Slave traders supplied the colonies with their human cargo, and as they intermingled, they formed ethnic groups like the Creoles. The settlers adapted to their new homes and passed on their beloved cultures and histories to the next generations. Scotch bonnet pepper is just one of the ingredients that make Creolan food livelier than the rest. They are related to habañeros, only they \"cause dizziness, numbness of hands and cheeks, and severe heartburn\" when eaten raw. When I made jerk chicken, I had to wear disposable gloves before I handled them to avoid trouble. But there is no gain without the pain, so I attempted to make my own and relive our time on the islands. A day later, I served it on the side with roasted pork ribs on the bone, and the rest of the night was, well, spent at home. Don't say I didn't warn you! Ingredients: 2 palm-fulls of scotch bonnet peppers, some halved 1 large white onion, thinly sliced 1 medium carrot, cut in matchsticks 5 cloves of garlic, minced 1 small knob of ginger, peeled, sliced thinly white vinegar salt 1. In a sauce pot, simmer the garlic and ginger in the vinegar with some salt. Add carrots and peppers. Keep the fire low and stir ocassionally to avoid the vinegar from boiling. 2. When vinegar is somewhat reduced, remove the garlic and discard. Taste the liquid at your own risk. Season with some salt. Turn off the heat and let cool before transferring to a glass jar. Keep in room temperature for at least eight hours and then refrigerate to preserve. Serve a small portion when needed.

108 West 44th Street between Sixth and Seventh Avenues 212/302.0707 $190 for two people with sake, without tip ♥ ♥ ♥ You have a favorite spot when you're craving something and you just know that whenever you go, it would not disappoint. This is how I feel about Sushiden, my restaurant of choice when I crave sushi after having been away from the city. When the Dr. and I return from a vacation, the first full meal we eat the next day is sushi. It's like a cleansing ritual for us; to rid off a lot of fried foods from Central America or decadent meals eaten in Europe. When we came back from Nicaragua, Sushiden was closed, but we found Sushi Zen a few blocks away. And what a find it was. The fish of the day was a special kind of yellow snapper flown in from Japan. It tasted like Japan was only ten minutes away. It was so fresh and so buttery, I couldn't help but order two pieces. (Which probably explains our bill at the end of the night.) The bowl of seared tuna with yuzu, sprouts and pea shoot leaves was a great indication of a great meal. The pea shoot was a little peppery and it gave a nice contrast to the citrusy flavor of the broth and highlighted the freshness of the tuna. We were impressed with the salmon tagine, which simmered only in Japanese scallion broth, some miso and hot peppers. It reminded me of Korean chigae, only more pure than any stew I've ever tasted. The giant clam was sliced to look like enoki mushrooms waving on my plate-tender with good texture. The jack mackerel wasn't as oily as I expected and the kelp rolled with the fatty tuna helped me from rolling my eyes in superlative appreciation. And Anthony Bourdain said sushi on Mondays is a bad thing! Related post/s: My favorite sushi place, Sushiden

164 West 75th Street on Amsterdam Avenue 212/787.6300 $280 for four people with eight glasses of drinks, without tip ♥ ♥ ♥ Ah, the upper west side, you keep surprising me. 'cesca has been on our list of places to eat for the past year because Cameron lives around the corner. After Telepan, I'm more confident to pick a restaurant in the upper west side even if it bills itself as a family-owned Italian restaurant. (I don't have any good experiences to write about family-owned Italian restaurants in Little Italy and the space next door has turned over more than I can count.) The 'cesca menu looked good the first time I read it from the outside of the restaurant and it looked good the night we visited. Four of us were seated in the wine nook; a table fit for ten became our own private space for three hours. The sommelier, a giant with a short ponytail, selected for us a light red wine after our glasses of Prosecco. The octopus sopressata, so called because it's dried, pressed and sliced thinly, reminded me of the octopus carpaccio we ate in Prague. The pickle-ly taste offset the bitter mustard greens. I couldn't pass up the chance to try their veal meatballs. They were served in a clear, hot broth, perfect for the harsh temperature outside. The Parmigiano gave it a beefier, fuller taste. We also shared a third appetizer, the escarole salad with tuna, fennel and pomegranates. While we waited for our two main dishes, we were served a complimentary course of faro wheat. We didn't really understand how we became so lucky, but our waiter quietly mentioned Babbo when we asked. I think he overheard us talking out our most recent experience at Babbo and appreciated the fact that we like our authentic Italian food. (I think taking photos of food really helps.) The special of the night was a seafood risotto and we divided that with a rack of lamb chops and servings of broccoli rabe and roasted Brussel sprouts that tasted like fresh potato chips. To tell you the truth, I enjoyed my medium-rare lamb so much I don't even remember tasting the risotto. During our espressos, we split the panna cotta with mixed fruit compote and the warm chocolate cake with créme fraiche. I really won't make fun of the upper west side again.

I had enough crayfish meat and crayfish broth leftover from the crayfish rice that I decided to make soup. At first, I was just going to use the broth and add some vegetables, but after tasting it, I knew something was short. My mother said she imagined the soup to be thicker because the crayfish taste was so concentrated. So I put on my coat, braved the winter weather with pajamas on and ran to the corner deli and bought a can of corn and a pint of milk. Using a blender, I made my own creamed corn. I wanted to test it first before I used the rest of the broth so in a smaller pot, I simmered a small dollop of the corn with some of the broth. When the mother hen approved, I made a bigger batch good enough for four people at work the next day. Ingredients: 2 pounds crayfish, washed bacon 1 can of kernel corn 1 cup of milk 2 ribs of celery, cut in smaller pieces 1 red onion, halved 1 red bell pepper, finely chopped 1 green bell pepper, finely chopped 1 chayote, peeled and diced salt, pepper, oil 1. Make crayfish broth. Separate the crayfish heads from the tails. Put the heads in a big soup pot with some water and let it boil. Add onion and celery ribs with some salt. Simmer until ready to use. Peel tails and devein. Chop in smaller pieces. 2. In a skillet, render fat off bacon until crisp. Remove to a plate lined with paper towel. When cool enough to handle, finely chop bacon. Set aside. 3. In a blender, purée corn while adding a little bit of milk slowly. The consistency should be creamy without being too thick. 4. In a soup pot, transfer the crayfish broth without the solids. Simmer and add the vegetables. Cook until the chayote is soft. Add a little bit of the creamed corn slowly until desired consistency. Season with bacon bits and pepper. Serve with country bread. Related post/s: How to cook your rice with crayfish

Tomatoe, tomatoh. Potatoe, potatoh. Crayfish, crawfish. No matter what you call these small lobster lookalikes, they're good to go in a big soup pot. And you know what? They're even better with bacon. They were selling them alive in Chinatown but they were left out in the cold-that made it easy enough to pull their heads from their bodies. I put all the heads in a soup pot to make broth while I chopped up some vegetables for this recipe. Peeling the tails was another story. It's a lot of work with so little yield; I should have gotten more than two pounds. But in the end, my rice was delicious and it was even better with some barbequed pork. Ingredients: 2 pounds crayfish, washed bacon 4 ribs of celery, 2 finely chopped, 2 cut in smaller pieces 1 red bell pepper, finely chopped 1 green bell pepper, finely chopped 2 cloves garlic, minced 2 red onions, 1 finely chopped, 1 halved 3 cups rice salt, pepper, oil 1. Make crayfish broth. Separate the crayfish heads from the tails. Put the heads in a big soup pot with some water and let it boil. Add the halved onion and the big celery ribs with some salt. Simmer until ready to use. Peel tails and devein. Chop in smaller pieces. 2. In a skillet, render fat off bacon until crisp. Remove to a plate lined with paper towel. When cool enough to handle, finely chop bacon. Set aside. 3. Using some of the bacon fat, sauté garlic and onions. Add crayfish, celery and pepper and sauté until tender. Season with salt and pepper. Add rice and 3 cups of the crayfish broth. Cover and cook the rice in medium fire. Check often and add more broth to keep it from drying. When rice is almost done, fluff with a spatula and mix until combined well. Turn off the fire, cover the pot and let the remaining heat finish cooking the rice.

136 West Houston Street off Sullivan 212/228.4181 $150 for three people with six drinks, without tip ♥ ♥ I'm always walking on Houston Street, but I have to admit that I never pay attention to the restaurants on the street. There are a few off Sullivan Street, right before you turn towards Bleecker, but I've never been inclined to check them out. We wanted sushi one night after a few after-work drinks in SoHo but Blue Ribbon was, as usual, packed and there was quite a wait at Nagomi. Yama or Tomoe are not good options to me so I was delighted to eat good sushi at Ushi Wakamaru. The uni was fresh and the ankimo creamy. The otoro was still the most expensive on the menu but it was still less than what Gari would charge. They accommodated my requests for salmon skin and shiso leaf makimo before we closed our tab. They didn't take unfamiliar requests like shiso with pickled carrots and daikon-something Sushiden wouldn't refuse-but they pretty much met my expectations.

This recipe was very close to my heart because Filipinos fry plantains and fry fish, too. It's always cool to find out that a country so far from the Philippines have the same way of serving an ingredient. Esther told me that this recipe is a very famous goute, or a small meal eaten between 3 and 6pm, in the Ivory Coast. (That's merienda to the Filipinos.) Her recipe included one Maggi chicken bouillon but I used homemade chicken stock instead. I grew up with Knorr bouillons in our cupboard and know that it has a lot of salt so I decided to skip it even though the African store in my neighborhood sells them. I wanted the dish to be flavorful without using artifical ingredients. The stock gave the sauce some flavor and at the same time kept it from drying up. In New York City, it's impossible not to find plantains in any bodega. You can certainly substitute plain bananas but they'll fall apart when frying, so if you do, try to use the firmer ones. Ingredients: 1 tilapia, cleaned 3 yellow ripe plantains, halved and then sliced lengthwise 1/2 cup chicken stock 1 large tomato, roughly chopped 1 medium onion, roughly chopped red pepper powder salt, oil 1. Make the piment d'alloco, or thick, hot tomato sauce. In a saucepan over low fire, heat some oil and sauté onions. Add tomato and simmer until thick, about 20 minutes. Slowly add chicken broth to keep it from drying. Season with salt and red pepper. Set aside. 2. Prepare the alloco. Using a skillet, heat some oil and fry plantains until both sides are lightly browned. Remove to a plate lined with paper towel. 3. Rub salt all over the tilapia. Using the same skillet, fry the fish in hot oil until both sides are golden brown. Serve with the plantains and pour over tomato sauce.

205 Tenth Avenue between 22nd and 23rd Streets 212/675.8805 $84 for two people with three drinks, without tip ♥ ♥ ♥ If you're looking for a good tapas place in New York City, Tia Pol is most likely recommended. I rarely make it around the Chelsea neighborhood, so I visited about two years after the entire city has already fawned over it. Ever since they opened in 2004, the wine hasn't stopped flowing and the customers haven't lost their patience waiting for a spot. We waited for about 45 minutes to be seated with our glasses of wine one warm winter night. When we finally made it, it was as if the bartender was waiting for us all along. She was very busy, yet attentive. She forgot to bring out the lamb but everything else we ordered lifted our spirits. The food brought us back to Catalunya. The owners of Tia Pol say they opened a tapas bar because of an on-going love affair with Spain. I give it three stars for the same reason.

For this recipe, I made my own shiso oil to drizzle the prawns with after flash-frying them, but I also used the leaves to wrap them. A toothpick can hold the leaf in place but I ended up using one of the prawn's harder feelers as a replacement. Ingredients: 5 prawns, peeled but with heads intact, deveined, feelers and arms chopped 5 shiso leaves shiso oil rice flour club soda red pepper flakes lime salt, oil 1. Wrap each prawn with a shiso leaf. Use a toothpick to keep the shiso leaf in place. 2. Make batter. In a shallow bowl, combine flour, red pepper flakes and salt. Drizzle club soda slowly and mix until it has that pancake batter consistency. Cover each prawn with batter. 3. In a skillet, heat some oil and flash-fry for about 4 minutes, turning each prawn gently with tongs after two minutes. Remove to a paper towel-lined plate and squeeze with lime juice. Serve immediately. Related post/s: Homemade shiso oil Where to buy fresh shiso leaves Shiso-marinated beef stir-fry

I've never seen Ming Tsai on TV before so when I happened to flip to PBS and saw that his ingredient of the day was shiso leaf, I tuned in. Perilla, or shiso leaf to the Japanese, is a member of the mint family. There's no mistaking that after you take a bite. It has a nice kick to it that's why it's perfect as a palate cleanser after a few pieces of sushi. What I like to do when I'm at a Japanese restaurant is to ask the sushi chef to make me a small shiso leaf maki after my omakase meal. It ends the night with a piece of rice and a bright taste in my mouth. Ingredients: about 30 pieces of shiso leaves grapeseed oil 1 tbsp ginger, peeled, minced 1 tsp sugar salt and pepper 1. Prepare an ice bath in a small bowl in the sink. Boil some water in a pot with a lot of salt. Blanch shiso leaves in boiling water for 1 minute and immediately remove to the ice bath. Squeeze in a ball and cut in smaller pieces. 2. Put shiso leaves in a blender with the ginger, sugar and a little bit of salt and pepper. Blend while slowly drizzling a little bit of grapeseed oil into the mix. Season to taste. Use for shiso-wrapped tempura prawns or shiso-marinated beef stir-fry.

Pork Chops With Rye-Bread Stuffing

***CONTENT
In 1959, The New York Times published a recipe using pork chops. Because pork chops are an inexpensive cut of meat, it was then \"dinner on the cheap.\" Everything is expensive nowadays but three thick chops are still affordable at $9 from Dom's in SoHo and a knob of rye-bread from Balthazar only cost me $3. I didn't have caraway seeds for the stuffing so I grounded some fennel and cumin seeds to substitute. It was also a good time to use the parsley I planted last year because it's been growing like crazy on my window sill. I didn't seal the pork pockets with toothpicks after stuffing them but they held together nicely and didn't fall apart. I boiled some pasta during the last few minutes of cooking, tossed it with the pork chops fat and served it with these delicious chops. Ingredients: 3 bone-in 1-inch-thick pork chops, sliced to form a pocket a small knob of rye-bread, thrown in a blender or food processor to crumb 1 medium onion, roughly chopped 1 clove garlic, minced 1 tsp fennel seeds, grounded 1 tsp cumin seeds, grounded a small bunch of parsley, roughly chopped 1 egg, lightly beaten 3 tbsps butter 3/4 cup chicken broth salt and pepper 1. Preheat the oven to 350º. In the meantime, make stuffing. In an ovenproof pan, melt 2 tablespoons butter over medium heat and sauté onion and garlic until softened, about 5 minutes. Add to a large bowl with the bread crumbs, fennel and cumin, parsley and egg. Season with salt and pepper. Mix with a fork until well combined. 2. Season both sides of the pork chops with salt and pepper. Fill the chops with the stuffing. Arrange in the same ovenproof pan and bake, covered, for 45 minutes, turning them over gently after 25 minutes. 3. Switch the oven to broil, move up the oven rack and brown the chops for 3 minutes per side, uncovered. Transfer to a serving platter and keep warm. 4. Set the pan on the stove over medium heat and add remaining butter and broth. Reduce the pan juices to a thick glaze. Simmer, scraping up the pan drippings, until thick enough. Season to taste. Strain over the pork chops. Related post/s: Where to get pork chops and rye bread

You came from New York City to get lost here?!, the lady at one of the refuges exclaimed when we told her where we came from. \"Here\" was the Pyrenees on the Catalan side, six hours from Barcelona by bus through the town of Vielha, and \"lost\" were two amateur hikers in the middle of the mountains, cold, soaking wet, scared and panicked about sundown. Our adventure in the Pyrenees started four years ago, when we read about Carros de Foc, a company in Spain that established a route to connect the nine existing refuges in and around Aigüestortes i Estany de Sant Maurici National Park. Each stop at a refuge earns you a stamp on your \"forfait,\" or hiking passport, and ten-the last one is the same as the first, which completes your loop-earns you a T-shirt exclusively given to those who finish the trek. At first, it was all about the T-shirt, but as we ascended over granite after granite in the rain and descended down slippery trails in the snow, our goal became more simple: to live with ourselves shamelessly afterward. Aiguestortes means \"twisted waters\" in Catalan. Every hike up gave us clear lakes and ponds to look at. Every trek down showed us waterfalls coming out of every crevice. We had never seen anything more beautiful in our lives. If it weren't for the hail striking our faces, the wind pushing us back and the snow freezing our hands, we would stop and enjoy the view. There were days when the sun came out blazing, and those were the days we enjoyed the most, even with our 25-pound backpacks. But the most rewarding were those we spent wet and miserable on the trail, finding our way to the refuge we were scheduled to spend the night in after eight hours of hiking, coffee with brandy waiting to warm our bodies and our hearts. It was definitely the most emotional and the most physically grueling trip we've ever taken together. Nothing could have prepared us from trekking the Pyrenees, Catalan style.

I'm not sick of bacon just yet. The third yield from my first shipment of bacon became dinner. This would be awesome with some mashed potatoes on the side. Ingredients: 6 pieces of large scallops 6 slices of bacon 1. Season scallops with salt, pepper and paprika. Wrap each scallop with a piece of bacon. 2. Using a skillet, sear each bacon-wrapped scallop until bacon is crisp and golden brown. Sear the side where the bacon ends first. Using tongs, gently turn them and cook the other sides. To make sure the bacon stays closed, sear the end again for the last few seconds. Remove to a paper towel-lined plate. Serve on a different plate after 1 minute.

Talk about a quick lunch with bacon. I was hungry but I didn't want a limp and sorry-looking sandwich. I wanted something filling, semi-healthy, and of course, robust. (I think robust is a good word to describe this sandwich.) The only shortcut I took here is to buy a few slices of honey-roasted turkey from the grocery deli. Using one loaf of French bread, this recipe fed two hungry people. Ingredients: 4 slices of honey-roasted turkey breast 4 slices of bacon 1 avocado, halved, pitted, thinly sliced 1 portobello mushroom 1 bunch of arugula, rinsed and patted dry French bread, halved, toasted For onion relish: 1 yellow onion, thinly sliced 1/8 cup dark brown sugar 1/4 cup red-wine vinegar 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar For aïoli: 1 egg yolk 1 garlic clove, minced 1 tsp Dijon mustard 2 tbsp sherry vinegar oil, salt, pepper 1. Make onion relish. In a saucepan, boil the onions in water until soft. Remove from heat and drain. Return to the pot and add brown sugar, red-wine vinegar and balsamic vinegar. Simmer in low fire until liquid is thick-I had this simmering until I was ready to assemble the sandwich. Stir ocassionally. 2. In the meantime, roast portobello mushroom. Preheat oven to 400º. Place mushroom, pleats side up, on a baking sheet. Drizzle some olive oil and balsamic vinegar on mushroom and roast until soft. When cool to the touch, slice and set aside. 3. Cook bacon. Using a skillet, cook about 4 slices of bacon until crisp. Remove to a paper towel-lined plate. Set aside. 4. Make aïoli. In a blender, purée yolk, garlic, mustard and sherry vinegar until smooth and creamy, 2 minutes. Slowly drizzle olive oil into running blender until completely emulsified, about 2 minutes. If aïoli gets too thick, add a small amount of warm water, 1 tsp at a time. Season with salt and pepper and cover and refrigerate until ready to use. 5. Assemble sandwich! Lay toasted bread halves on a chopping board. On one half, spoon the onions and top with the meats and vegetables. Drizzle with aïoli. Top with the other half and hold together using a toothpick.

One of the best presents I received this year was a 3-month Bacon of the Month Club membership from Zingerman's. Cameron just knows what the hell I would squeal over for my birthday. I love that Aaron and Pete understood that a box of pork delivered at work would be something I would actually want. For the first installment, I received a pound of Applewood bacon. I could have easily had bacon and egg breakfasts throughout my entire week off from work until all the fat killed me, but I wanted to do something more special with my present. I searched for several bacon recipes, edited them to my own style and shared the bounty with family and friends. After all, what is Christmas without the sharing? When these bacon corn muffins were warm enough, they were packed in a large Ziploc bag and stuffed in a hand-carry tote, eaten onboard a plane. Ingredients: 1 1/4 cups whole milk 1 large egg 3/4 stick unsalted butter, melted 1 cup yellow cornmeal 3/4 cup all-purpose flour 4 stalks scallions, chopped 4 bacon slices 2 tbsp sugar 1 tbsp baking powder pinch of salt 1. Cook bacon. Using a skillet, cook bacon until almost-crisp. Remove to a paper towel-lined plate. When cool to touch, roughly chop. Set aside. 2. Preheat oven to 375º. Whisk together milk, egg and butter in a small bowl. In a different bowl, whisk together remaining ingredients. Add bacon. Combine both mixtures and stir. 3. Grease a 12-muffin pan and fill in with mixture. Bake on middle rack until golden and a toothpick comes out clean, about 15 minutes. Turn off heat and cool in oven for about 5 more minutes.

608 Fifth Avenue at 49th Street 212/489.3747 from $2.50 to $11 each ♥ ♥ Wagashi, or Japanese pastry, is served in traditional tea ceremonies. They are usually made of Azuki, kidney or soy beans combined with mochi-rice or wheat. The most common types are the jelly and rice cakes which come in different fruit flavors and colors. Minamoto Kitchoan is not a restaurant, but stopping by the store on Christmas day, I couldn't help but be tickled by the beautifully packaged pastries. You can pick and buy whatever you want or else one of the Japanese clerks will follow you around with a tray so they can handle the delicate goods themselves. The ones pre-packaged start at $2.50 each but there were some expensive kinds inside the glass cabinets. They're all perishable of course, so they must be eaten within a two-week timeframe. Every $5 you spend will earn you a stamp on a card and you can get a small discount when you've spent at least $100. And at Minamoto Kitchoan, it's easy to do just that. Pretty store, pretty little things.

Our cameras were packed for our trek back to Restanca. We were in a hurry, not only to finish our hike and get the T-shirt we've been working our aSses for the last seven days, but we also had to catch the last bus back to Barcelona at 1pm. When we woke up at Ventosa the next morning, it was snowing. We trudged in the snow on the lookout for trail markers. Most of them were already buried in white, but we persevered even though the Dr. was bleeding from the chafing of his wet pants to his knees. At Restanca, we received our tenth and last stamp on our forfait. One of the staff members handed us our T-shirts without any fanfare. I didn't even care that the only size available was an extra large. We got out of there with fire in our pants and hiked for another hour to catch the cab waiting at the foot of the mountain that took us to the bus station. Video diary, day 7: Surviving the Catalan Pyrenees Aboard the six-hour bus ride back to the city, the Dr. and I would occasionally look at each other in disbelief. What were we doing for seven days in the mountains? Did we really get lost twice? What would have happened if we didn't serendipitously find the house of the Long Island man? What if we didn't get out of the forked road to Estanc Llong? We had three days left on our vacation to contemplate all those questions. At the moment, Barcelona and civilization were waiting.

If you want to be technical, Sugar Hill, aka Hamilton Heights and West Harlem, is 123rd to 155th Streets bordered by Hudson River and Edgecombe. The merengue music doesn't really start playing until a block away, on St. Nicholas. I grew up in Washington Heights and I used to vote there, so if you go by voting zones, Washington Heights is District 12, 155th Street up to 200th.

We left Estanc Llong with a group of women, one of whom was a Canadian expat who spoke to us in English. She invited us to hike down the mountain with them where we grabbed a 4×4 to the opening of the trail to Ventosa i Calvell. Was it cheating? We didn't think so. If the park ranger told us to take the shortcut to Blanc, we can take the shortcut to Ventosa. The hike was almost three hours from the visitors' station up to mountains anyway. On our sixth day, we just wanted to finish our trek and make our way back to Barcelona. After we separated from the women, the hike to Ventosa was chilly but pleasant. When we made it to the refuge, we saw snow on the mountains. We had the entire afternoon to rest, and we knew we needed it because the next day involved trekking back to our starting point at Restanca, going down the mountain, and making the 1pm bus back to Barcelona.

This was probably the easiest Christmas dish I've ever cooked. The two Cornish hens I bought in Chinatown cost me less than $10. All I had to do was ask the butcher to cut off the head and the feet. My large Dutch oven fit both of them that I was able to brown and roast under 45 minutes. The first time I tried this recipe, I used Silkie chicken. This time, I used the game hens but made the marinade with pomegranate molasses rather than seeds. My favorite part is sautéeing the orange peels in butter until fragrant-one of the least expensive ways to make a dish smell and look festive. I wish you were here. Merry Christmas. Ingredients: 2 Cornish game hens, rinsed and patted dry 1 cup Marsala 2 tbsps pomegranate molasses fresh sage leaves a handful of mint leaves, chopped zest of 1 orange, cut into 1/4-inch strips 1 tbsp butter salt, pepper, olive oil 1. Make marinade. In a small bowl, mix the Marsala with the pomegranate and mint. Set aside, covered, for 1 hour. 2. When ready to cook, preheat oven to 350º. Season the birds inside and out with salt and pepper. Tie the legs together with kitchen twine. In a Dutch oven, heat the butter with olive oil over high heat. Add 3 sage leaves and cook for 1 minute. Brown the hens on all sides. Lower the heat and add the rest of the sage leaves. 3. Transfer the pot to the oven and roast the hens for 7 minutes. Remove the pan from the oven, drizzle 3 tablespoons of the marinade and dot with some butter. Baste the hens with the juices and roast for another 10 minutes or until the juices run clear when the thighs are pierced with a fork. 4. Meanwhile, in a small pot, heat some more butter and cook orange zest for 5 minutes until the zest absorbs the butter. Remove from heat. 5. Transfer the hens in a dish, sprinkle with zest and drizzle with pan juices. Related post/s: Where to buy Cornish hens and pomegranate molasses Or else, use Silkie chicken

Braised Pork Belly

For Christmas Eve dinner this year, I wanted something more substantial than just lechon kawali. Deep-frying was the only way I knew how to cook pork belly until I ate at Gramercy Tavern for the first time years ago. So of course today, I turn to Tom Colicchio's recipe to recreate the eyes-rolling-back feeling at home. The photo below looks a lot like the one from the Filipino version but this one was heftier-you can smell and taste the concentrated flavor of the braised vegetables. The skin was chewy on this version and it's recommended that it be discarded before serving, but the meat and the fat easily give when pierced with a fork. Patience is a virtue. This dish will make any pork lover swoon. Ingredients: 2 pork bellies, cut into 4 large chunks 2 carrots, coarsely chopped 2 celery stalks, coarsely chopped 1 leek, white part only, trimmed and chopped 1 onion, coarsely chopped 2 garlic cloves, peeled 3 cups chicken stock 1 tbsp peanut oil salt and pepper 1. A day or a few hours before cooking, rinse the pork bellies and season with salt and pork. Air-dry for several hours and then store in freezer, each piece separated, on a plate. 2. When ready to cook, preheat oven to 350º. Heat the peanut oil in an ovenproof skillet over medium heat. Remove the pork from the freezer only when ready to cook. Add them, fat side down, to the skillet. Cook until the skin is browned, about 15 minutes. Brown the other sides for a few extra minutes then transfer to a plate. 3. Pour off all but about 2 tablespoons of fat and add the garlic, onion, carrots, celery and leek to the skillet. Cook the vegetables, stirring occasionally, until they are tender and beginning to brown, about 20 minutes. Return the pork belly to the skillet, fat side up, and add about 2 cups of stock, enough to surround but not cover the meat. Bring the stock to a simmer, then transfer the skillet to the oven. 4. Gently simmer the pork, uncovered, for 1 hour, then add another cup of stock. Continue cooking until the pork is tender enough to cut with a fork, about another hour. If necessary, keep adding stock to keep the skillet from burning. 5. Allow the pork to cool in the braising liquid. Remove the pork from the liquid, then gently lift off and discard the skin using a small knife. 6. Strain the braising liquid and discard the vegetables. Return the liquid to the skillet, bring it to a simmer and skim off the fat. Serve the pork in a shallow bowl moistened with a bit of the braising liquid.

The German couple at Colomina decided not to go ahead to Estanc Llong on our fifth day. It was simply raining too much. We've gone so far even after our first setback, we decided to go for it after breakfast. Visibility was at zero and we had large rocks to cross. The rain erased the paths. We followed as much as we can see until we reached a fork on the trail. We spent at least three hours trying both ways and retracing our steps. It was hard to swallow and admit that we were lost for the second time during our hike. We looked around us to see where we can sleep as soon as it got dark. There were no trees and no crevices in the rocks. We had a sleeping bag, but it was also wet because of the rain. As soon as we stopped on our tracks, we shook and froze-we knew we had to keep walking. Video diary, day 5: Arriving at Estanc Llong after getting lost for eight hours Back in Colomina, another young German couple just came from Estanc Llong. We remembered them telling us that the refuge was nestled among tall trees. Since we've tried every which way to get out of the mountains, we followed the Dr.'s instinct and walked along the trees, praying under our breaths that our next turn would be rewarded with a view of the refuge. I cried as soon as I saw the roof of the refuge. We really thought that we had to sleep in the rain out in the mountains. There was a smaller group already preparing for dinner when we walked in. We were so relieved to see other people again. During dinner, the only English-speaking hiker told us she was an expat from Canada. She invited us to hike down the mountain with her group, where we would catch another 4×4 with them and we would continue to our next stop, Ventosa i Calvell.

From Josep M Blanc to Colomina, the fog was thick and the rain steady. A young German couple we met at Blanc were going the same way. The girl was wearing a bright yellow covering on her backpack and we followed it to make sure we were going the right way. When we arrived in Colomina, we ended up eating dinner with them. They told us that they kept looking back during the hike to look for us. They were looking for us to make sure they were going the right way! Video diary, day 4: Rain and wind to Colomina Video diary, day 4: Arriving at Colomina The refuge at Colomina was held down by giant steel cables.

We had to start over from Espot and waited for a 4×4 to fill up with other tourists until we reached Amitges, the stop we missed the previous night. As soon as we received our fourth stamp there, we hiked down as quickly as we could to Mallafre to get our fifth stamp. Because we were trying to recover from our mistake, going through the mountains and making it to Josep M Blanc the same night was next to impossible. A park ranger in Espot advised us to take the forest route because he was expecting another downpour in the afternoon. Video diary, day 3: Recovering from a mistake and on to Josep M Blanc Video diary, day 3: Arriving at Josep M Blanc We might have taken a shortcut, but to us, the hike from Mallafre to Blanc still took four and a half hours.

After hiking in the rain to Colomers, the sun was out in full force our second day. We felt well-rested even though we slept packed like sardines on bunk beds. The hike was exhausting because there were plenty of rocks we had to cross, but we made it to Saboredo without any problems. Video diary, day 2: Waking up in Colomers Trouble began after Saboredo: we took a different path and walked for hours following yellow marks on the trail. (Later, we learned that the yellow marks were for the entire national park, and not for the trail we were supposed to follow.) When we finally reached a small town, we knew we were in the wrong place because we have gotten used to hiking without seeing anyone, or anything, except for rocks, trees and lakes. When it started drizzling, I knocked on the first house we saw to ask for help. With the Dr.'s little command of Spanish, he told the guy our story. Where are you guys from?, he asked us in English. We were surprised he spoke English in these parts. When we told him that we were from New York, he smiled and told us he was raised in Long Island. Video diary, day 2: Passing through Refugi de Saboredo I am still flabbergasted when I recall this story. We had no clue where we were, and someone, someone up there, was watching us to help us get back on track. It turned out that we hiked up north to the ski town of Salardu, far, far away from our stop of the night at Amitges. He called the refuge and told them we weren't going to make it-a search party is dispatched if someone with a reservation via the Carros de Foc office in Vielha doesn't show up in any of the refuges. He bought us beers at the local pub while we waited for a cab that took us to the nearest town of Espot. Video diary, day 2: Getting lost on the way to Amitges, ending up at Espot It was disheartening to get lost on our second day, and the Dr. completely gave up when we talked about our options during dinner. We were a day late and we knew it was going to be more difficult to finish the trek in less than seven days. It was only in the morning that he expressed continuing on after talking to the park rangers who directed us to take a 4×4 to Amitges, get our stamp and rush to Mallafre, and then hike through the forest to Josep M Blanc, where they were expecting us for our third night.

We started our hike from the town of Vielha where we took a cab to the beginning of the path to Restanca. I cried the first hour as soon as I realized I signed up for a hike that would last six more days. We had on our 30-pound backpacks. It was so difficult, but the view from Restanca was absolutely amazing. On our way to Colomers, where we were to sleep the first night, Mother Nature brought hail, and then a downpour. When we arrived at the refuge, we were so glad to change into dry clothes and eat dinner with several other hikers.

Because the suckling pig feast was a success, I put my name down for the Christmas goose. Cameron named her Shazia, after another NY1 reporter who does the Zagat reviews on TV. It wasn't difficult to carry her home like Rog; I just put her in my tote bag, dragged it to work and made the trip uptown. I picked up Shazia last week after Mike from Tamarack Hollow Farm hand-plucked the feathers for about two hours. I thought you could just submerge any bird in hot water and the feathers will easily come off like for chickens, but I learned that because geese are water fowls, they have oily feathers. Soaking them in water would only repel their natural oil-you really have to hand-pluck them. We didn't do anything special for Shazia. We only let her thaw in the fridge for a couple of days and just went to Chef Weld's Brooklyn apartment for our holiday dinner. I saw him tie it up and rub it with some spices and next thing I know, it was in the oven. I saw him remove the goose fat and later used some of it for gravy with the liver. It was a huge bird, about 11 pounds, and I was a bit curious at how long it was, instead of, say, round like a turkey. We spent a couple of hours hanging out and eating sausages, prosciutto and cheese while the bird stayed in the oven. There was sparkling wine and a few bottles of red. I was so glad to finally open a bottle I've been saving-a 2004 Châteauneuf du Pape. Sharing it with good company and good food made it even tastier. A bowl of roasted potatoes was served together with some sautéed purple cabbage and apples and frisée and endive with roasted red beets. It was my first goose so I was very surprised that it didn't turn out tasting like duck, as I expected. The meat was, for a lack of a better word, tighter. It was also more gamey and had a taste of offal. A few pieces later, I was already full. It was like eating a big chunk of beef steak. Christmas goose to me is very Charles Dickens. In Manila, we always had ham for noche buena or crispy pata (pig's thigh) with the other traditional Filipino dishes, but I suppose the Victorian way was to always included game meats because they were expensive back in the days. My goose cost a lot of money but I bet we had a better time than the Cratchits.

132 Crosby Street between Houston and Prince Streets 212/965.1777 $7 for rice with two choices, with chai, without tip ♥ ♥ This hole-in-the-wall is only one of the stops a New York City cab driver makes during his daily route. For $7, the guy behind the Lahore counter will give you rice with your two choices of curry. When I have a craving, I order the lamb or the goat with the alo saag, a spinach and potato mush spiced with fragrant cardamom, cinnamon and fennel. Or else I go for the chicken with the okra stew or the chickpea dal and pay extra for a small container of yogurt. They also sell sandwiches which are easier to eat especially if you're on the go, as well as samosas and traditional Pakistani pastries. There are a couple of stools if you prefer to stay in and eat but don't say I didn't warn you when your clothes end up smelling like the aromatic kitchen. Whatever I order, I don't skip on the hot chai to push down all the heavy goodness I call lunch.

I stopped by the Dr.'s apartment the other night looking for something to eat and discovered a big pot of chicken stew on the stove. For the past few years, I've seen him cook big pots of anything-stew because of his schedule. He'll have time to pick up groceries but not enough to cook, so they end up sitting in the fridge. The next time he gets a break, he throws them in a pot before they spoil, cook and eat it as a stew for a couple of days-it's the recipe that keeps on giving. He didn't have cooked rice so he quickly boiled some water and cooked pasta to match. I ate two bowls' worth and basically finished what was supposed to be his packed lunch the next day. Over the weekend, I found some leftover herbs in the fridge from my last trip to the grocery store so I thought I'd make my own. I picked up a couple of boxes of golden raisins to make the stew sweet and used up the chicken legs and breasts I've been meaning to cook since last week. Campagne means \"countryside\" in French and I use it for this chicken stew recipe because it is so simple to make, yet rustic and hearty to eat. It's so easy \"your country-ass can make it,\" as Anthony Bourdain would say. Serve it with the leftover white wine you used to cook and pour over rice, pasta or bread. Save some to share with your own Dr. Ingredients: 6 chicken pieces, excess fat and skin removed 6 slices of bacon, cut in small pieces 2 cups dry white wine 1 large plum tomato, chopped 1 bunch of baby carrots, peeled and cut in small pieces 1 red bell pepper, julienned 1 yellow bell pepper, julienned 1 orange bell pepper, julienned 2 small boxes of golden raisins 1 red onion, sliced thinly 2 garlic cloves, minced thyme sprigs rosemary sprigs red pepper flakes salt 1. Preheat oven to 300º. In a large Dutch oven, render fat from bacon. Sprinkle in red pepper flakes. When there's enough fat, brown chicken pieces on both sides in batches to avoid overcrowding. Remove chicken and bacon to a plate. 2. Lower the heat and sauté garlic until light brown and onions until transparent in rendered fat. Add herbs, peppers and carrots and cook for a few minutes. Add tomatoes and cook until a little bit crushed. Add wine and cook, uncovered, until liquid is reduced by a third. 3. Add raisins, season with salt and simmer for a little bit before covering and putting in the oven for 1 1/2 hours. Serve with rice, pasta or country bread.

Dashi is fundamental to Japanese cooking. Kelp and bonito are boiled down to make the dashi broth that's most popularly known as the base for miso soup. With soy sauce, or soyu, and rice wine vinegar, or mirin, you can make the simplest yet most satisfying Japanese soup perfect for a last course after a heavy meal. Ingredients: green-tea noodles, half of the 7-ounce packet 1 quart vegetable stock 2 tsps dashi granules 1 tbsp rice wine vinegar 1 tbsp soy sauce firm tofu, drained, sliced into squares 1 small sheet of dried seaweed, torn 2 tbsps sesame seeds, toasted 1. Cook the noodles in a large saucepan of boiling water for 5 minutes. Drain and rinse in cold water. 2. Combine the dashi granules with the stock in another large pot. Stir over medium heat until the granules are dissolved. Bring to a boil and stir in mirin and soy sauce. 3. Divide the noodles and tofu cubes in serving bowls. Ladle hot soup and garnish with nori and sesame seeds. Related post/s: Where to get dashi granules, rice wine vinegar and nori

The Chinese use five-spice powder to create a blend of different flavors: sweet, sour, bitter, pungent and salty. You can easily buy them from any grocery store with a well-stocked spice aisle but I prefer to make my own. With one star anise, I used the heart of my palm to measure the other four ingredients and grind them using a mortar and pestle. If you have a Filipino dad, he should be able to grind them for you. You can make a salad from your leftovers by adding some sugar snap peas and chopped red bell peppers. Just whisk together some fish sauce and lime juice in a small bowl and pour over the noodles for dressing. Ingredients: 2 duck legs, excess fat trimmed but skin left on 2 small bundles of somen noodles 4 cups chicken broth 1 star anise scallions, finely chopped cilantro, finely chopped peanut oil 1 tbsp red chili sauce For the five-spice powder: 1 star anise 1/2-inch cinnamon stick fennel seeds whole cloves black peppercorns 1. Preheat the oven to 400º. In the meantime, lightly coat the duck legs with the five-spice powder and set aside. Heat some oil in a frying pan and brown the duck legs, skin-side down first, about 5 minutes each side. Transfer to a baking dish and cook for about 25 minutes. Remove from the oven and let them rest on the chopping board. 2. In a small pot, boil some water and cook the somen noodles for 2 minutes. Drain and rinse with cold water while separating noodles with a fork to avoid sticking. 3. In another small pot, let the chicken broth boil with the other star anise. Then simmer for a few minutes with the scallions and cilantro. 4. To serve, divide noodles and ladle broth in bowls and top with sliced duck meat.

I adjusted this from a vegetable ramen recipe using rice and potato vermicelli. This may seem to require a lot of ingredients but it's easier than you think-just put all the vegetables in the pot and boil. Any vegetables will do, really, and I've tried this with baby bok choy, Napa cabbage and carrots. Ingredients: 1 pack each of rice and potato vermicelli a quart of vegetable stock 1 packaged firm tofu, sliced in small squares zucchini, chopped in half moons snow peas, destringed and sliced in half leeks, white parts only, chopped shiitake mushrooms, dusted off dirt, halved a small knob of ginger, peeled and sliced thinly garlic, crushed 1 packet of white miso powder 1 tbsp rice wine vinegar 2 tbsps soy sauce sesame oil 1. Sauté ginger and the garlic in a stock pot first then add the vegetables, stirring for 5 minutes. Add stock and let boil. Turn down the heat and simmer. Stir in miso powder, rice wine vinegar and soy sauce. Adjust to taste. 2. In a separate pot, cook noodles in boiling water for 4 minutes. Stir with a fork to avoid sticking. Drain with cold running water. When cool enough to handle, use your hands to separate noodles and drain some more. 3. Put a handful of noodles in a bowl and ladle in soup. Add a drop or two of sesame oil. Related post/s: Where to get white miso powder

The temperature outside finally went down. Now, it really feels like almost-Christmas. Before the squash and the pomegranate completely disappear from the markets, I made a very hearty soup perfect for a Netflix night. I still had leftover molasses from the last pomegranate recipe and that made this soup a little tart and gave it a nice spunk. Ingredients: 1 butternut squash, cut in half lengthwise 1 quart chicken stock 1 tbsp pomegranate molasses 1 pomegranate (optional) 1 cup heavy cream a handful of pine nuts, toasted then some of it grounded 1 tbsp honey a pinch of nutmeg powder half a cinnamon stick, grounded a pinch of whole cloves, grounded salt, pepper, olive oil 1. Preheat oven to 400º. Drizzle the inside of the squash with olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. On a baking sheet, bake cut side down for up to 2 hours. When done, let cool and then scoop out all the squash meat in a bowl. 2. In a pot, simmer the chicken stock with the squash, grounded pine nuts, honey, nutmeg, cinnamon and cloves for about 40 minutes. Using a blender, puré in batches and transfer back to another pot with a strainer. Simmer and keep adding chicken stock while stirring ocassionally to thin the soup. 3. In the meantime, make the topping. In a small glass bowl, whisk heavy cream and molasses until fluffy. Ladle the soup in serving bowls and top with a dollop of this cream. Top with remaining pine nuts and some pomegranate seeds. Related post/s: Don't waste all that pomegranate molasses Where to buy pomegranate molasses

Flank Steak with Sugar Snap Peas on Vermicelli

There have been some wonderful sugar snap peas in Chinatown for less than $2 a pound. I imagined making some sort of crunchy salad with them so I stopped by my butcher on Mott to buy a nicely-red beef flank steak to match. After searing the steak, the sauce caramelized and I ended up throwing the snap peas in the same skillet to wipe it off. The beef came out perfectly medium-rare and pink inside when I was slicing it against the grain. You can definitely eat this with rice but I opted for vermicelli noodles to make it lighter. Because it took less than an hour to make this, two people were able to drink the rest of the night after eating. Ingredients: 1 pound of beef flank 4 tbsps kecap manis 3 tbsps sambal oelek a bunch of cilantro, finely chopped 4 cloves of garlic, minced 1 tbsp sesame oil 2 tbsp peanut oil rice vermicelli 1 red bell pepper, julienned a handful of sweet snap peas, trimmed salt 1. Marinate the meat. In a large bowl, combine kecap manis, sambal oelek, cilantro, garlic and sesame oil and rub all over the flank steak. Cover and put in the fridge for about 20 minutes. 2. In the meantime, trim the peas and julienne the vegetables. When ready to cook, heat peanut oil in a large skillet and sear the flank steak in high heat. Let it sit on one side first without moving it and then turn to sear the other side, about 8 minutes each depending on its thickness. Remove to a chopping board and let rest for about 5 minutes. 3. Keep the heat on and cook the peas using the remaining oil and crusty bits in the skillet and then add the peppers. Stir-fry until peas are tender. 4. Boil some water in a pot and then turn the heat off. Add the vermicelli in the hot water and let it cook in the remaining heat for a couple of minutes. Drain and using a fork, separate noodles and serve in a bowl. Slice the beef against the grain and serve on top of the noodles with the vegetables. Pour remaining sauce from the skillet on top.

I'm on a Thai and Indian kick lately so I've also been craving spicy and hearty stews. But I didn't want to spend too much time cooking last night-I just wanted to eat. Something quick for dinner to me means stopping by the Asia Food Market around the corner from the office and buying fragrant Thai basil leaves and lemongrass. Chicken is usually my fallback when I just want to eat from a big rice bowl in front of the TV and I ended up doing just that after putting this together, quickly and painlessly. I made a big batch so guess what I'm having for lunch? Ingredients: 4 boneless chicken thighs, cut in small pieces 1 bunch of Thai basil leaves a handful of cashews 1 small knob of ginger, peeled, sliced thinly 4 garlic cloves, minced 1 lemongrass stalk, crushed, chopped 1 bunch of cilantro stalks, finely chopped 2 red chilis juice from 1 lime 2 tbsps palm sugar 2 tbsps fish sauce oil 1. In a large bowl, mix the chicken with the ginger, garlic, lemongrass, cilantro and chilis. 2. In a large skillet, heat some oil and lightly toast the cashews. Remove to a plate and drain with a paper towel. 3. Add more oil to the skillet and cook the chicken in batches, stir-frying until they're cooked and lightly browned. 4. Stir in the basil leaves with the lime juice, sugar and fish sauce until the leaves wilt. Toss in the cashews and simmer until the liquid thickens a bit. Related post/s: Another Thai-inspired dish

Thank you very much for the recipe. I've had a Basil Duck dish in many Thai restaurants and wanted to try to do it myself. This isn't quite the same (they never had cashews in it), but I'm hoping it's similar enough with a bit of omission. The dish I've had's aroma was like walking in an aromatic garden! Reading the list of the places you've traveled, I'm going to have to bookmark this page for future reference. BTW, I'm a native Vermonter...

I never really bake because I'm not a big fan of desserts. When I tell my friends who love to bake that I am a better cook because I can just throw ingredients in a pot and make a nice dish out of it, they tell me the same thing-that they throw eveything in a bowl and bake. I honestly think baking requires more skill and patience. I can chop vegetables until my hands are numb so I can make my own Vietnamese summer rolls and I enjoy braising and waiting for my beef bourguignon to come out of the oven, but I have no patience to wait for anything to turn golden brown. If I need more than my finger to poke and see if it's cooked inside, then I don't want it. I bought a loaf of ciabatta bread the other day to make some pizzetta for dinner and ended up only using less than half of it. I didn't want it to go to waste so I picked up a quart of heavy cream the next day and actually baked pudding when I got home. Sure enough, it took a few TV shows before they were the color I imagined the top of pudding should be, but they actually came out perfectly. I used a 12-muffin tray and topped them with caramel sauce and packed them for sweet-toothed co-workers the next morning. Ingredients: 1 big loaf of day-old bread 3 eggs 3 egg yolks 1 cup maple syrup 2 cups heavy cream 1 cup milk 2 tsps vanilla extract 2 tbsps butter 1. Prepare everything before baking. Preheat oven to 300º. Grease muffin tray with melted butter. Set aside. Slice and break bread into small pieces and fill each muffin hole. 2. In a large glass bowl, whisk together eggs and egg yolks. Add 3/4 cup of the maple syrup, 1 cup of the heavy cream with the milk and vanilla. Pour this mixture into each muffin hole with the bread, enough to make sure they are swimming. 3. Fill a deep baking tray with about 2 inches of water. Place the muffin tray in the baking tray and bake until golden brown, about 1 hour. If necessary, gently flip each muffin with a spatula and cook the bottom of the muffins until they are also lightly browned. 4. During the last 30 minutes of baking, make the caramel sauce. In a small non-stick pan, heat the remaining maple syrup and whisk in the other cup of cream until thickened. Add the butter and a pinch of salt and keep whisking in low heat until caramelized. 5. When ready to serve, place muffins on a plate and pour caramel sauce on top. Related post/s: Where I buy ciabatta bread Leftover ciabatta bread

The Dr. and I stopped by the Union Square Wines & Spirits store before we viewed the amazing Ron Mueck sculptures in the Brooklyn Museum on Saturday. They were having a free tasting of several Bordeaux and Burgundy wines from France with Marcus Lartigau, a French wine guru. We stayed for about an hour and we learned a lot of things during the tasting. I took notes and I'll try to list them here from my indecipherable handwriting to share with you. If you look at a map of France, you'll see that Bordeaux is on the lower west side of the country, closer to Spain, while Burgundy is to the east. Red wine from Bordeaux is made from Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon with small quantities of Cabernet Franc, Malbec and Petit Verdot for blending. White Bordeaux is mostly made of Semillon but also with a blend of Sauvignon Blanc, Muscadelle and Ugni Blanc. Red Burgundy is made exclusively of the Pinot Noir grape while white Burgundy is all Chardonnay. Most of the wines from Bordeaux follow a classification that's why a lot of people think they are more \"intellectual\" than Burgundy because of the rules they follow. A lot of vineyards in the Burgundy region have multiple owners so a lot of the wines come with several names on the labels. But the most obvious thing that a lot of people don't know about the two wines is the bottle shape. Bordeaux bottles have high shoulders while Burgundy bottles slope. The following list consists of the wines we tasted. My personal favorite was the red Bordeaux from Chateau du Tertre at around $35 a bottle: 1. Domain Michel Niellon 2004 Chassagne-Montrachet Blanc - Burgundy -- a little anemic 2. Chateau Carbonnieux 2004 Pessac Leognan Graves Grand Cru - Bordeaux -- grapefruit, very clean 3. Domain Ramonet 2004 Chassagne-Montrachet Rouge - Burgundy -- tangy in the beginning but very good in the end 4. Chateau Grand-Puy-Lacoste 2001 Pauillac Grand Cru - Bordeaux -- some raisin, a little bit of spice 5. Chateau du Tertre 2002 Margaux Grand Cru - Bordeaux -- bolder and fuller, more spice 6. Chateau Gruaud Larose 2003 Saint-Julien - Bordeaux -- a little bit more alcohol and drier

213 East 45th Street between Second and Third 212/867.5454 $104 for two, with two drinks, without tip ♥ ♥ There are two ways you can order your grilled food at Aburiya Kinnosuke. The robata grill is right at the bar where the Japanese chefs set skewers next to burning coals (not on top of) and take about 30 to 40 minutes to prepare. If you choose the shichirin grill, your meat will be served on top of a little clay pot and you can grill your food yourself. The portion is small you won't be grilling like you do at a Korean restaurant. It's all done that Japanese way: simple and understated. When we reserved two seats at the bar, the fish of the night was yellowtail and the specials board noted that they were all flown in from Japan. The restaurant's specialty is fish collar and because the yellowtail probably flew in style, it was priced at $30. We were interested to try it even at that price but thankfully, they were all out of stock by 9pm. We opted for the sea bass collar instead for $7. For collars, I don't care if the fish came from another country. If it's a cheap cut of fish, it really shouldn't be more than $10. That said, we imagined our $7 sea bass collar was as good as how the $30 one would have tasted. It's grilled the same way and it probably had the same amount of meat as the yellowtail. But we started with the monkfish liver first. We never fail to order ankimo when it's on the menu and Aburiya Kinnosuke's is as delicate as they come. Another item we don't skip at Japanese restaurants is the uni. The sashimi was served in a small woven basket with two kinds of kelp. I couldn't help but order the fresh sea eel minus all the familiar kabayaki sweet sauce. They were served with the eel bone deep-fried with a dollop of wasabi. The eel meat was soft, yet very meaty, and it really had its own sweet taste without the dressing. The pork cheeks were delicious. They were chewy but tender enough to make us forget that cheeks, too, are considered cheap cuts. The offal taste was offset by the sweet seaweed and lemon juice. The fried chicken balls came with grilled peppers, something we've come to love after Barcelona, and powdered sea salt. They were crunchy without being too heavy. Next were the beef slices on the shichirin grill. They were atop a dried magnolia leaf and a handful of miso chiffonade garnished them. We cooked them for only a few minutes, rare and juicy enough to eat. The servings were small so Aburiya Kinnosuke's pacing was key. There were short pauses in between our dishes that allowed us to enjoy our Sapporo and plum vodka. Our dessert was one of the best things I've had since my visit to ChikaLicious: white sesame pudding with vanilla ice cream. The sweetness was so restrained and the nuttiness so addicting that I could have eaten another serving even though we were so full. The crowd at Aburiya Kinnosuke is more adult and more moneyed. In fact, you can reserve a booth behind small curtains where a lot of the Japanese men probably conduct important businesses. (Since the initial reviews were published in 2005, they have employed English-speaking staff. The white girl who answers the phone is as fluent in Japanese as any of the chefs.) I understand that I have to go to midtown to have a real Japanese meal because of the proximity of the United Nations building. If I count how many times I eat Japanese food in a given month, I would group the restaurants in midtown as the best ones. Aburiya Kinnosuke is just one of them.

792 9th Avenue between 52nd and 53rd Streets 212/459.9057 $52 for two, BYOB, without tip, cash only ♥ ♥ I never make it to the Hell's Kitchen neighborhood but before a My Morning Jacket concert at Roseland Ballroom, we wanted to eat dinner. Wondee Siam came recommended from an out-of-towner. Forgive me for being cynical, but I usually would not take a recommendation from a tourist, especially for Thai food. But I stand corrected. Not only did Wondee Siam offer traditional Thai food, it also offered the good kind. So what if he got the advice from Zagat's? When we were ordering our meals, I told the waiter I wanted duck so I asked for his opinion between two dishes that had roasted duck in it: Yum Ped Yang and Duck Ka Prow. He said he likes the Yum Ped Yang one (or so I thought) so I nodded to order that. When it was time to eat, he brought both dishes to us. When I told him I only picked one, he apologized but left them on the table. When we realized he was not going to take the other plate away from us and from our bill, we just asked him to pack it for us to take home. Some battles should be left untouched especially if the Yum Ped Yang with slivers of green apples and cubes of pineapples was really good. The duck wasn't roasted, it was deep-fried, and it tasted more like bacon than it did duck. (It looked like bacon, too!) But I was all over the fresh combination of the chili pepper, lime juice and cashew nuts that I didn't really care if it wasn't the dish I ordered. The duck Ka Prow tasted familiar because I cook it at least once a month with chicken. Fresh basil is always a nice touch with sweet soy sauce even though the menu listed it as oyster sauce. The mixed seafood roll was like a deep-fried version of shumai and was served with that sweet orange dip Chinese restaurants call duck sauce. The menu listed it as plum sauce which I thought has a darker color. I barely tasted the crab which is featured as the main ingredient but it was still a pretty good appetizer. The chicken was good, too, drowning in all the sauce which makes your mouth numb in a good way. We had a good meal at Wondee Siam because their selection was also better than Pongsri's downtown, so I'll give them two stars even though what we ended up eating were not exactly what we initially wanted.

1569 Lexington Avenue off 100th Street 212/348.0200 $25 for two, without drinks, without tip ♥ For brunch one Sunday, we took the bus to the east side of Harlem and sat at the bar of Food. We watched ice skating on one TV and that weird game of stone and broom called curling on the other. Jewel also happened to be playing from their satellite radio. Food is a restaurant that seems out of place in the El Barrio area of the upper east side but it's also one of the sure signs that the neighborhood is really changing. Space and rent prices are two of the reasons why businesses are opening uptown. They are also trying to reach those customers who have moved up for the same reasons. No one could have imagined two Asian people being served by a French man in Harlem just a few years ago. Whether these changes are accepted or not, what we ordered were enough to start our day right: turkey burger with fries and huevos rancheros with bacon and beans. They were good, not exceptional, but the ritual of brunch is always better than the meal itself. I'm just glad Food makes it easier for us uptowners to partake in it.

The Dr. was on call so I knew I had time to make dinner before he comes back from the hospital. I stopped by the Blue Moon fish stand at the farmers' market on my way to work and bought a couple of swordfish steaks. I've been buying fish from them because they also give me fish heads for free to make stock. Lately, I go up and check what's on their blackboard and buy the kind I've never cooked before. We caught a swordfish when we were vacationing in Panama but we let the bugger go because he was so small. Notorious for being elusive, it's a good fish to catch for sport. The FDA warns about high amounts of methylmercury in them so it's been adviced not to eat them more than one serving a week. But oh, they make an excellent dinner with a bottle of white wine and they can make a very tired doctor happy. Ingredients: 2 swordfish steaks, sliced about 1/2-inch thick 2 bulbs of endive, leaves separated 6 slices of bacon a handful of cherry tomatoes, cut in half 2 garlic cloves, minced juice of half a lemon 2 tbsp butter 1 tbsp sugar parsley, finely chopped salt, pepper, olive oil 1. Marinade swordfish in a shallow dish with the garlic, lemon juice, salt and pepper and olive oil. Make sure the fish is well-coated. Cover and chill in the refrigerator for about 20 minutes. 2. Braise endives in the meantime. In a deep skillet, bring 1 cup of water, butter, sugar, a pinch of salt and pepper to a simmer. Add endive in one layer and braise them, covered, turning wedges over once in a 10-minute period. Remove lid and increase heat to medium-high, then cook until all of liquid is evaporated and endive is caramelized, about another 6 minutes. Transfer to a serving plate. 3. Place swordfish on a baking sheet with the tomatoes and broil in the oven for about 20 minutes or until fish is tender and cooked through, turning over once. Place on top of the endives. 4. Cook bacon in a skillet until golden brown and crispy while the fish is in the oven. Transfer to a plate lined with paper towel and drain. Chop roughly and sprinkle all over fish with the parsley. Serve with lemon wedges. Related post/s: What the FDA says about swordfish Buy fish from the Greenmarket

I cooked these steamer clams the way I cook mussels, but I added some fresh basil to give the dish a different taste. It was a nice appetizer with crusty ciabatta bread. Ingredients: half a dozen steamer clams, rinsed 2 tbsps butter 1 cup of dry white wine a small bunch of basil leaves 1 bay leaf parsley, finely chopped 1 medium onion, finely chopped 2 garlic cloves, minced 1. Put the shallots and white wine into a large stainless steel pot. Add the clams and cover. Steam them over high heat until the clams have opened, about 5 minutes. 2. Drain the clams into a large bowl, saving the liquid. Discard unopened clams. Return the liquid to the pot and bring to a boil. Add the butter, basil and chopped parsley. Pour this broth over the clams and serve immediately. Related post/s: Mussels with white wine

For Thanksgiving this year, we had two roasted turkeys, one ham, five black sea bass, lumpia, or Filipino spring rolls, and three different kinds of salads to serve to eighteen people who celebrated with us in the apartment. We thought there would be a lot of leftovers but we were wrong. Our guests were good eaters and they cleaned everything off their plates. With the small amount of turkey meat left, I made some tacos and I made some quesadillas for lunch the next day. After eating a couple of them, I thought, why not mix them together? I call them tacodillas. Ingredients: leftover Thanksgiving turkey meat, off the bone, shredded soft flour tortillas Monterey Jack cheese, grated 1 tomato, chopped 1 small red onion, finely chopped cilantro, finely chopped lime juice flaming cock hot sauce 1. Cut a tortilla in half. Prepare on a skillet. Lay one half of the tortilla and add some cheese and turkey meat, then follow with the rest of the filling. Cover with the other half of the tortilla. 2. Turn the heat on to medium. Using a heavy but smaller pot lid, press the tortilla to flatten. The heat will melt the cheese inside and make the two tortillas stick to each other. Turn and brown the other side using a wooden spatula or a flat spoon. Related post/s: Where to get Sriracha, or what I call the flaming cock hot sauce

Tyler asked me where he could buy pomegranate molasses. I've had Pom juice before but I've never heard of pomegranate in molasses form. I Googled and found out that it's typically used in Mediterranean dishes. He found it for $8 at Dean and Deluca and used it to make some sort of appetizing tapenade. A few days later, I found a $4 bottle in Chinatown sans the pretty burlap packaging. I slathered the molasses in meatballs to give them that sweet and sour taste and served them with tomato mint salad. Ingredients: pork and beef ground meatballs cumin seeds, grounded coriander seeds, grounded turmeric powder red chilis, crushed 3 tbsps pomegranate molasses tomatoes, chopped mint leaves, finely chopped 1 tbsp red wine vinegar salt, pepper, olive oil 1. Make meatballs. Dip in pomegranate molasses and then gently roll each ball on cumin, coriander, turmeric and red chilis. 2. In a deep skillet, heat some oil and fry meatballs until golden brown in medium to low fire. The molasses will burn faster than the meat so keep them bouncing in the hot oil using a strainer ladle. 3. Make tomato mint salad by combining tomatoes and mint in a bowl, dressed with red wine vinegar, olive oil and some salt and pepper. Top with meatballs.

227 Tenth Avenue off 23rd Street 212/242.1122 $102 for two, with three beers, without tip ♥ ♥ The red and white wooden paneling didn't fit the stereotypical Chelsea mold. The laid-back staff made me completely forget I was in New York City. It was a Friday night and all the tables were booked but the maitre d' politely told me over the phone that I can easily sit at the bar before 7:30pm. For the next two hours, people slowly filled the place with a buzz. We weren't at all rushed by the bartender even though a few other couples stood at the door waiting to be seated. Where was I? I was at The Red Cat. It was also the day after Thanksgiving and at The Red Cat, there were plenty of non-fowl choices. We ordered the fried oysters served with creamed spinach. The spicy tuna tartare came with mustard, scallions and potato chips. The grilled octopus with zucchini and prosciutto. The lamb sausage was heartier than the others with white beans and watercress. A couple of pints of Old Speckled Hen pushed everything down and a lemon tart closed our tab. None of the dishes made my eyes roll back but they were delicious and safely executed. I visited The Red Cat and left all my expectations at the door. Do the same and you'll also be pleasantly surprised. Related post/s: Tia Pol is also in Chelsea

My first reaction was, What the hell is that? The sign at the farmers' market said romanesque, a hybrid of a broccoli and a cauliflower. It was so pretty and it made me so curious, I picked up one for myself for $3. It reminded me of a small piece of coral. Before cooking it, I actually let it sit on my table at work as a conversation starter. The spikes are as tender as cauliflower. If you apply enough pressure, they break easily and crumble. But it's as sturdy as a broccoli. I was able to take it home in a plastic bag without damaging it. I could have made a stir-fry dish but I just wanted to taste it on its own without any sauce or dressing. I reluctantly cut up the pretty-looking romanesque in smaller pieces and salted and steamed them for 12 minutes. I shocked them in ice water to stop its cooking, drained and put them on a plate. I had leftover umbriaco cheese in the fridge and it was like a jackpot tasting them together. Adding prosciutto was also a nice touch. Ubriaco means \"drunken\" in Italian and the hard cheese I got from Di Palo's is made from cow's milk soaked in red wine. A stripe runs through the middle to give it a nice touch of color. It actually has a plum taste to it, a little bit sharp and tart. Ingredients: 1 romanesque, cut in smaller pieces Umbriaco cheese, shaved (or any hard cheese will do) prosciutto salt 1. Steam romanesque for 12 minutes, salting them halfway through. When done, shock them in ice water and drain to a plate. 2. Sprinkle shaved cheese and serve with prosciutto.

The Betawi are the descendants of the people living in Jakarta and soto translates to soup. Soto Betawi is traditionally made with offal but Thalia's recipe is a tamer version, just perfect for New York's current dipping temperatures. The tamarind marinade made this soup a little sour with the tomatoes and the lime, which I loved, but I also added extra spices to give it a little more kick. I browned the beef first for some color and I just used the separate beef stock I had saved in the freezer. While the stock was simmering, I quickly deep-fried the emping melinjo crackers I bought from Chinatown. They added a nice crisp to the nutty-sour flavor of the soup. I think Thalia would have been proud. Ingredients: half a pound of sirloin beef 2 tbsps tamarind concentrate 1 can coconut milk beef stock 2 medium potatoes, quartered 1 large tomato, chopped 1 stalk lemongrass, pounded 2 stalks scallions, finely chopped 1 shallot, finely chopped 2 tbsps semi-sweet soy sauce or kecap manis emping melinjo crackers, deep-fried 1 bay leaf 1 tbsp turmeric 1 tbsp cumin, grounded red chilis cilantro, finely chopped 1 small lime sugar salt, pepper 1. Prepare a day before: tenderize the sirloin beef by pounding with a mallet on a wooden block. In a small bowl, combine tamarind concentrate with sugar and salt to make a paste. Marinate beef in the fridge overnight. 2. When ready to cook, boil potatoes in a pot of water. In the meantime, cut beef into small cubes. In a pot with hot oil, sauté bay leaf and shallots and brown beef on all sides. When potatoes are done, drain and lightly brown in the same pot. 3. Add beef stock and simmer. Stir in coconut milk. Add tomatoes, cumin, turmeric, lemon grass, lime juice, chilis and salt and pepper to taste. Simmer for a few more minutes until beef cubes are tender. 4. To serve, put some of the meat and vegetables in a bowl first. Ladle broth and sprinkle with scallions and cilantro. Crush crackers on top. Squirt with leftover lime juice and stir in some kecap manis to taste.

If you've been visiting this site long enough, you know I spend a lot of time and money at Di Palo on Mott and Grand Street. I never wait less than 30 minutes except if I order ahead of time and arrange for a pickup. I usually just come in, pick a number from the machine at the door and wait for my turn to taste some new cheese or cold cuts and add to my usual order of prosciutto, spicy sausage, olive oil, illy coffee and Callipo tuna. During my last wait for 45 minutes, a dinner idea popped in my head and I ended up buying everything at Di Palo except for the fresh arugula I picked up at the grocery store on my way home. They also carry bread from Sullivan Street Bakery so I didn't have to go out of my way-their focaccia rosemary bread is one of my favorites. Ingredients: 1 square focaccia rosemary bread fresh mozarella Italian prosciutto, sliced paper-thin by the meat guy fresh arugula, rinsed, pat dry olive oil 1. Preheat oven at 350º. Prepare pizzetta on a baking sheet wrapped in aluminum foil. On the focaccia bread, lay the mozarella slices first and then top with prosciutto. Drizzle some olive oil. Lay the arugula and then some more prosciutto again. 2. Bake in oven for 15 minutes, enough to melt the mozarella and toast the bread.

I keep seeing this weird bulb in Chinatown but no one could tell me what it was. I asked the vendor and all I got was a OneDOLLAH! So I asked my dependable Chinese friend, Shao, and she said her mother calls it choi tao but she wasn't sure what Americans call them. A visit at Telepan answered my question. Our friend's chicken dish came with cauliflower and kohlrabi. I've never heard of kohlrabi before so when I got home, I Googled it and lo and behold, it was that Sputnik bulb! The name comes from two German words that mean cabbage and turnip but its flesh is like the stem of a broccoli. You peel off the tough outer layers and cut the flesh in an angle to get slices like that of an apple. Shao's mom uses two bulbs to include it in a pork and vegetable stir-fry. I found an old zucchini recipe that I thought would work with the tender flesh of a kohlrabi. Ingredients: 1 kohlrabi, peeled, diced 1 garlic clove, crushed, sliced 1 tsp cumin, grounded 1 tsp fennel seeds, grounded 1 tsp black peppercorns, crushed 1 red chili 1 bay leaf 1 tbsp lemon juice salt, pepper, olive oil 1. In a large skillet, heat oil over medium heat. Toast bay leaf until fragrant and remove. Sauté garlic. Add kohlrabi and spices. Set aside some of the ground spices for garnishing. Cook until soft, stirring constantly, about 30 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. 2. Serve in ramekins and sprinkle with a little lemon juice and remaining ground spices.

309 East 5th Street between First and Second Avenues 212/254.2244 $25 each for three, with three beers, with tip ♥ ♥ ♥ As soon as the the Dr. had a slurp of Soba Koh's broth, he said, Sobaya has been crushed. Now, we like Sobaya, our usual Sunday lunch destination, but we've been wanting something new. Unfortunately, Soba Koh only opens after 5pm, so when we were looking for a place to eat one Thursday night, we agreed to walk over the east side for some hot bowls of soba with a couple bottles of Sapporo. The kinoko soba is filled with three kinds of mushrooms-enoki, shimeiji and shiitake-and its broth was rich and earthy but subtle at the same time. I ordered the soft-shell crab tempura soba because I've been seing fresh soft-shell crabs in Chinatown lately. My broth tasted different from the kinoko's, a tad lighter and cleaner, even with the deep-fried batter and shellfish on top. We also got some deep-fried shrimps with their heads on and chicken wings with sansyo peppers for appetizers. Both only whet our appetites. The chicken wings were a little slimey to me, only because I expected them to be fried but instead they were broiled and moist inside. The shrimps were crunchy and even tastier with a squeeze of lime juice. Soba Koh might not have a soba maker on display like Sobaya and Honmura An, but their firm noodles easily compared while their broth exceeded expectations.

Corner of Wooster and Prince no phone number about $12 for two, without drinks, without tip ♥ Updated, 2006: They do have a phone number! 917/674.1869 and of course, \"Cal\" is from California I assume Calexico is currently enjoying their Vendy Award status as a finalist because I had to try twice before I finally got the chance to buy lunch from their spot on Wooster and Prince. When we finally found the cart, we ordered their tacos for $3 each: the much-loved carne asada, the pork and the pollo asado. For an extra $2, you can get two tacos of your choice with rice and beans. They're set up in front of the Camper store. Expect a wait during lunch time but they move quickly and take your order right when you walk up and stand in line. They called our names with our tacos in less than ten minutes. I think I'm just being a snob because I've eaten so many tacos this year alone, but Calexico definitely does not sell the best one in the city. The carne asada is pretty good and the pork is okay, but I've definitely had better. The guacamole was runny so it made us wonder if it is homemade or from a jar. I'm not quite sure if it's a Tex-Mex thing to only have one tortilla instead of two but it was very messy to eat my tacos. We ended up sitting on the stoop a block away and our tacos fell apart at every bite. It's $2 cheaper than La Esquina but if I have to pick between the two, my vote goes to the one with a phone number.

It's cool if you don't like our tacos more than La Esquina's - that's a matter of personal preference, and La Esquina does a great job. But I do have to correct you on one thing. Our guacamole is not at all runny - it's chunky and delicious and made fresh a few times a day. What you had on your taco was Avocado Sauce, just like the menu says - and that's supposed to have a creamy, light texture like creme fraiche. We would NEVER use anything out of a jar, especially not guacamole. We make everything except the tortillas from scratch - including the beans and pickled jalapenos. The comment about the single tortilla being too messy is useful, though - we initally used 2 tortillas, but then went to 1 because most people preferred it that way. Maybe we'll try going back to 2. Thanks, Jesse Vendley Owner, Calexico

I schlepped in the pouring rain to stop by the farmers market and order my turkey for Thanksgiving. After I put my name down for an 11-pound bird, I noticed the Blue Moon Fish tent. There were a few people standing in front waiting to be helped so I squeezed my way in to see what the commotion was all about. They were giving away fish heads and bones for stock. I waited for my turn and got my own but I also ended up buying a $6 whole sea bass. Blue Moon hails from Mattituck, New York and they specialize in wild-caught fish. But I didn't even stay long enough to ask what kind of sea bass it was. The Dr. said it would be a black sea bass because that's the type most often caught in the east coast. I could only think of roasting it so I also bought a couple of fennel bulbs and bunches of herbs before I walked to the subway to go straight to work. I was juggling to hold my umbrella, my purse and the goods in my half-wet tote bag. At dinner time, I opened a bottle of Chardonnay from Lamoreaux and roasted the fish I stuffed with lemon, onions garlic and rosemary. While it was cooking, I made a bowl of salad. The Dr. stopped by after a long day in the hospital. He confirmed it was indeed a black sea bass and also gave me a nod for a wonderful rainy night meal. Ingredients: 1 whole black sea bass, scaled and cleaned with head and tail intact 1/2 red onion, sliced into thin rings 1/2 lemon, cut into thin rounds a few sprigs of fresh rosemary 2 cloves garlic, thinly sliced salt, pepper, olive oil For the fennel tomato salsa: 1 fennel bulb, chopped 3 medium tomatoes, diced and seeded 1 red bell pepper, julienned 1 yellow bell pepper, julienned 1 red onion, roughly chopped a handful basil leaves, torn a handful mint leaves, torn red wine vinegar salt, pepper, olive oil 1. Prepare the salsa. In a small heated skillet, let the fennel sweat to soften them. Toss for a couple of minutes and let cool. Combine all of the ingredients in a large bowl and toss to mix well. Let sit at room temperature for 30 minutes before serving. 2. Preheat oven to 400º. Rinse the fish under cold running water to make sure the cavity is clean of any entrails and pat dry with a paper towel. Stuff the cavity with the onion rings, lemon rounds, garlic and some of the rosemary sprigs. Put some in the head as well. Make small slits on the body to insert more garlic. 3. Place the fish on a bed of rosemary branches set in a large roasting pan. Rub the fish with the olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Roast the fish until completely cooked through, about 40 minutes. Transfer the fish to a large platter and serve with the salsa. Related post/s: Fresh fish from Blue Moon

64 Charles Street on West 4th 646/486.2185 about $200 for four, with two bottles of wine, without tip ♥ ♥ ♥ For a restaurant that wasn't selected by me-I met friends from out of town there-I was really surprised at how good our meals were at Mary's Fish Camp. I've been to Pearl Oyster Bar before and although pretty good, I remember not being too happy with my sandy razor clams. (The owner of Mary's was a partner at Pearl's before she left to open her own.) I was running late so it took a while for us to be seated because a party has to be complete before they let you in. (It makes sense unless, of course, you're the one your party is waiting for.) We were famished when our turn came, but oh, the surprises! The lobster pot pie was so delicate. Its puff pastry was so light with a ramekin filled with about two claws and some fortifying vegetable chunks. Grilled fish usually bores me but the whole branzino was stuffed with rosemary and other herbs for flavor. A squirt of lemon juice brought out its smokey flavor and we ravaged it until all we had were bones. You can usually find skate in New York City menus because it's so cheap but at Mary's Fish Camp, it's breaded and crunchy on the outside. It's much more exciting than Jean Claude's French version in SoHo. The cockles were also good, served with beans and thyme. We also ordered half a dozen of the oysters and although they were smaller than expected, I couldn't really complain. I love oysters so all you have to do is serve them fresh and we'll get along. The roasted beets with fennel and aged goat cheese salad was excellent. We left this for last as a palate cleanser and it was a nice break before dessert. We couldn't help but order the banana pudding with vanilla wafers. I don't think I've tasted a better banana pudding than theirs-balanced, not too sweet. A bottle of the white Burgundy and a bottle of Reisling completed our meal and we walked away from the West Village satisfied. Mary's Fish Camp is famous for their lobster roll so it was very pleasing to know that the other items on the menu stand out, too.

I lived in Washington Heights for more than ten years and I spent my formative high school years uptown, but like most New Yorkers, I never really made it past my comfort zone even though that already meant way above 14th Street for me. \"Hiking\" down from 207th to 97th Street was a new experience for both Cameron and me. After a big lunch at home, we took the A train to the last stop in Manhattan and walked towards Dyckman Park where it looked more like New England than New York City. It was an absolutely glorious day with the sun up and shining. The trees still had their leaves on and the light breeze was enough to cool us down. Through the park, we made it along the Hudson River where there was a walking path right next to the Amtrak rail. A short fence kept us away from it, but it was still exhilarating whenever a train would zoom by. For the next hour or so, we kept walking until we reached a dead end. We had no choice but to cut through thorny bushes and walk on the rocks right next to the river. We probably did something illegal, but the old mattresses we saw tucked under the rocks led us to think other people have gone that way, too. Twenty-eight blocks later and still no dead bodies to be found, we saw our reward: the 75-year old George Washington Bridge. At the bottom of the bridge, a more legitimate-looking pathway emerged from Fort Tryon Park. We walked towards the picnic area where we saw our second reward: the little red lighthouse, the only one in Manhattan. It was pretty cool to see it even though I haven't read the Hildegard H. Swift book because I've had a fascination with lighthouses ever since the Dr. and I drove all over the coast of Maine to visit each one marked on our map. The little red lighthouse under the great gray bridge was actually used by mariners passing through the Hudson until it was deactivated in 1947. They were going to dismantle and auction it off, but a lot of people who loved the book convinced the powers that be to keep it as a reminder of an area once called Jeffrey's Hook. In the book, the little red lighthouse is happy and content until a bridge is built over it. But in the end, the lighthouse learns that it still has an important job to do and that there is still a place in the world for an old lighthouse. We continued walking until the sun started to set, past the huge sanitation building and the Fairway on 135th Street. Even New Jersey looked pretty harmless from our side of the river. It got dark right away and we made it to 97th Street just in time for red wine, sausages and cheeses at the Vintage Wine Bar on 93rd Street.

Lechon Kawali, Deep-Fried Pork Belly

My brother loves to cook. In fact, together with a friend, he cooks for small private events in Manila. He'd like for his business to be a bigger catering service in the future but I think he likes the fact that he's paying attention to every detail in smaller portions than, say, a batch for more than a hundred guests. Of course, he has my mother's full support. She hires him to cater her parties whenever she is in Manila entertaining. Lechon kawali, or deep-fried pork belly, is one of the best Filipino staples. We like our pork and we like it even better deep-fried in hot, hot oil. The last time my brother visited New York, he made this and I swooned (and then I think I got a heart attack because of clogged arteries from all the fat) so I just had to call him to ask for the recipe when I had the craving. Letting the pork belly air dry after boiling and freezing it before frying are important. After boiling it until it was soft, I left the house at lunch and did not return until 10pm. I put them in the freezer and did not fry them until the next day. So it takes some time but I can guarantee you that all the trouble is worth it. Ingredients: pork belly salt, pepper, oil 1. Sprinkle the pork belly with salt and pepper and let it sit in the fridge for a few hours up to a day then boil in water until soft using a big pot with a heavy lid on low to medium fire. This should take about two hours. 2. Transfer to a colander in a large bowl to drain excess water and let it sit in room temperature to air dry. 3. When the pork belly is dry, cut it in four large chunks. Set them on a plate, separated, and store in freezer until the next day. 4. When ready to cook, heat a lot of oil in a heavy-duty pot, low to medium fire. In the meantime, take the pork belly out of the freezer. You will fry them frozen. There should be enough oil to deep-fry the pork belly chunks. Dip one chunk in the oil using a pair of tongs to test if the oil is hot enough. You'll just know. Set them gently in the oil and fry until golden brown, uncovered. Serve while hot and crunchy with crushed garlic in soy sauce and vinegar on the side.

Our best dining experience in Barcelona? Hands-down, it was at Cal Pep. I read about Chef Pep and how he still cooks at the bar and entertains guests with his cigarette-smoke voice as if he's known them for years, but no one seemed to know where Plaza de les Olles was until a local overheard us ask a boqueria waiter for directions. The waiter didn't know either so the local took a napkin and sketched out a street map for us. He was curious as to how we heard about Cal Pep because he told us it's one of Barcelona's foodie secrets. (Maybe that's why no one wanted to tell us where it was!) This got us even more excited and a 40-minute waiting time spent standing behind the bar stools (with champagne, natch) didn't seem to be an inconvenience. When we were finally seated, we noticed that the printed placemats matched the art hanging on the walls. They are sketches from different artists and they randomly give a different one to each customer. The more you make a mess, the more you get it replaced. So we sat at the bar elbow-to-elbow with everyone else-there is a dining room in the back but the action happens at the counter-and let one of the bartenders serve whatever he wanted us to eat (omakase, Catalan style!) while we started with the traditional toast rubbed with grilled tomato and garlic. The next three hours were pretty much heavenly. Everything was made with passion and you could watch the chefs toss, sauté, grill and fry different ingredients with gusto. Almejas, or clams, were quickly fried in olive oil and parsley. They were so fresh, you really didn't need much with them. The purple taint inside was so nice to look at, too. The chipirones, or baby squid, were the size of my thumb and cooked with garbanzos. This dish changed my distaste for chickpeas. The langoustines came next and we spent so much time peeling, eating the meat and sucking the juice out of their heads. They were a lot of work but every minute was worth it because the Dr. was so pleased. A German father and son next to us saw how well we ate, the father put some of his roasted pimento peppers on our plates to try. We ended up swapping stories throughout our meal. We could have ended our night there but we really wanted to taste the way Cal Pep cooks fish. It was almost 1am and they've ran out of monkfish so they served us seabass instead. The bartender showed us a fresh piece of fish and asked for our approval before cooking it. Before serving it to us, he filleted it for us. And it was at Cal Pep where we ended our vacation in Barcelona. We were full, drunk and happy as we stumbled back to our room in Hostal Goya room. After seven days of rigorous hiking, Barcelona meant to be our reward. It was just that. Related post/s: Where to eat in Barcelona: Tapelia + Xador Where to eat in Barcelona: Boqueria

During our hike in the Pyrenees, we met a French family who has lived in Barcelona for the last ten years. They recommended Tapelia for their more-adventurous tapas and paellas. We tried the pig's ears which were crunchy and addictively chewy. We had wine with it but it would have been more perfect with a nice pint of beer. The octopus with mushrooms and potatoes was tender and delicious. The squid was as good, if not better. And I could have eaten the anchovies with aubergines the entire night. We went on a Saturday night at 10:30pm which is prime dinner time in Barcelona, but Tapelia was still under-staffed. It took a while to get the menu, have our orders taken and get our final check, but it also made for a quiet first night in Barcelona. We also couldn't skip the paellas while in Spain. There were several fast-food type of places serving them around the city but we ended up at Xador in the El Born neighborhood. While also hiking the Pyrenees, we met a young German couple we ended up following during one of the routes to avoid getting lost. Funnily enough, we crossed paths again on the bus back to Barcelona so we got together one night to hang out and have dinner. Between the four of us, we ordered the langoustine and the squid-ink paella. They were just okay because to me, paella is like risotto-it's harder and harder to find people who can make it from scratch without it being soupy and mushy.

The Santa Caterina Market is the new boqueria. There's more space in between the stalls. It's more airy and better lit. The stores take credit cards and can deliver your orders. There's even wireless Internet connection. Of course, it's known for its Enric Miralles and Benedetta Tagliabue (EMBT)-designed flying carpet roof than anything else, but its location is so central it's hard not to do your shopping in there, too. One day before we started our walk, we had breakfast at one of the food stalls and ordered the stewed tripe. Someday, I'll be making tripe like this, too. We didn't always go to the boqueria for lunch. After a long day of sight-seeing, we stopped by Costa Gallega on Passeig de Gràcia. They have several branches in the city and is definitely a tourist magnet, but we had some nice tapas there which kept us going until dinnertime. Under the hanging hams, we sat at the bar and pointed to several things in front of us: anchovies with peppers and olives, ham-wrapped mozzarella balls and croquettas, a truly European treat.

More tapas places are opening up in New York City, but Barcelona just has the culture down. Where else but in Spain can you eat a decent bowl of stewed tripe for breakfast? Where else will you be spared a quizzical look when you order razor clams for a snack? And toasted bread rubbed with a grilled tomato and garlic? Thank goodness for those Galicians. Red wine with every meal whether it's 9am or 4pm? Bless their hearts. At the buzzing boqueria, or the central market, produce sellers co-exist with hungry shoppers and camera-happy tourists. Walk around and you can buy the freshest fruits and vegetables. Fish, clams and lobsters are around the corner. The store across the way has all kinds of meat and dried sausages. Stand behind those eating to make sure you get the next empty seat because we ate some of our best meals there. When we first arrived in Barcelona, we had a few hours to kill before we had to catch the 6-hour bus ride to Vielha, the nearest town to where we were supposed to begin our hike up the Pyrenees. Our first meal of the day was at El Quim. Everything they have to offer was written on the chalkboards. Specials are updated daily and we learned to ask for the price before ordering because a plate of mushrooms drizzled with balsamic vinegar cost us €16. We later saw the fresh mushrooms being sold in one of the vegetable stalls and they were really going for at least €8 for half a pound. The sausage was fried and when I took a bite, its crunchy skin snapped and I was rewarded with that kind of heavenly taste only sausages and bacon can give a human being. We returned to the boqueria two more times. While still in New York City, we ended up talking to a bartender who is also an expat. He recommended Pinotxo, or Pinocchio, so we couldn't fly back without trying. It's always packed because it's the first eatery you will see when you walk in the market and for several other reasons: white anchovies in good olive oil sprinkled with paprika, stewed garbanzos in fatty goodness, beef with white beans and flan for dessert. The service is brisk but they're so used to tourists that they're very accommodating towards those who have no qualms about eating whatever they have to offer and to those who make a face when they suggest something. At Kiosk Universal, we were finally able to get our fill of razor clams. I've never been a big fan because no matter how much you clean the diggers, they will always be sandy. They were still good, though, and any excuse to have more good olive oil and bread is acceptable to me.

Buy the Barcelona City Card for small discounts and unlimited bus and metro passes. If it's your first time in Barcelona, I'd recommend what the guide books tell you in terms of attractions: Sagrada Familia and Catedral are both under construction but we paid the entrance fees anyway to see the view from the top. Sagrada especially doesn't look like it will be done during our lifetimes so it's worth going up anyway. If it's nice out, Park Guell is a nice little hike. (I didn't make it to Montserrat or Costa Brava.) I hope you like Gaudi more than I do! For the other museums, we just stood outside and took photos. Contemporary Art was in the middle of moving exhibits so we couldn't go in. El Born was one of my favorite neighborhoods and although sketchy and most people told us not to go, we walked around the old Chinatown.

52 Irving Place corner of 17th Street 212/253.2773 $120 for two, with two drinks, with tip ♥ ♥ Mario Batali took a lit bit of convincing to let Chef Andy Nusser open up a Spanish tapas bar under his name, but as told in Heat, a tasting knocked their socks off. Two years after they first opened, the place is still packed and the wait to sit at the bar is still long. We went out one cold night after I wrote about Barcelona with plans on eating at Bar Jamon but I've been there so many times that I just wanted to see how its sister restaurant compared. Without reservations, the wait for the bar was an hour. We put our names down anyway and waited in the pub down the street. One Guiness later, the maitre d' called to seat us. We put our coats back on and ran back to the restaurant where he gave us two choices: a table that we will need to give up after an hour and a half for another couple who actually had reservations, or at the bar where we can watch the chefs cook. Which do you think we chose? We split four plates and a dessert with our small carafes of red wine. We saw that the Cal Pep of Barcelona had its influence here with their deep-fried green peppers and chipirones, or baby squid, with garbanzos, or chick peas. The giant duck egg is also a mainstay but we skipped those dishes because we wanted to try something with Casa Mono's own signature on it. The cockles, or small clams, were cooked with sloppy scrambled eggs topped with scallions. It was a good combination but we could barely taste the clams. The sweetbreads were toasty on the outside and soft in the inside and the roasted fennel was a nice touch. I would like to think I'm difficult to impress and only good chefs would think of bringing two things like them together. Speaking of another great combination, the pig trotters were made into breaded square patties sandwiched with white anchovies. The vinegary taste of the small fish provided a great balance to the overwhelmingly gelatinous and sticky quality of the pig's feet. It's definitely not for everybody but I loved it. (And if your dining companion ends up liking it, too, I suggest that you keep him.) I had to admit that I only ordered the cock's combs because I was tickled to say it. (What, the cockles weren't enough?) Because they were cooked in a porcini reduction, they tasted like mushrooms even though they had the consistency of soft tofu. They looked like black slugs on our plates but the earthy taste was very addicting. Two scoops of plum ice cream with candied orange rinds and crunchy orange-flavored nuts were the perfect ending to these flavorful, sometimes oversalted, dishes. Go to Bar Jamon if you want to have simpler tapas like cured meats, but Casa Mono is worth a try if you want to experience the Batali influence in Catalan cooking.

106 Kenmare Street between Lafayette and Cleveland Place 646/613.7100 about $18 for one, with one drink, without tip ♥ I celebrated my 2005 birthday in the basement of La Esquina. My guests and I had to walk through the door marked with an Employees Only sticker, down the stairs and past the kitchen to get to the dungeon-like setting of the restaurant. I had to reserve a table for thirteen pretty quickly with my credit card because the word had just gotten out about this \"secret place.\" I ended up throwing my party a day after Vogue Magazine did theirs. Nowadays, I usually end up in their corner spot, called The Corner, for a quick taco or grilled corn on the cob. Whether it's hot out or not, The Corner always has pretty people standing outside. But the cafe around the block is a much better place for a sit-down meal. The nopales, or cactus, salad is refreshing with tomato salsa and parmesan shavings. I also like their fish tacos. A chunk of grilled fish comes in a skewer on a bed of lettuce, tomato, onions and radishes with green salsa wrapped in warm tortilla. My only gripe is that their tacos cost $8 for two. I'd eat more often here if I didn't have to contribute to their rent, but alas, feeling like you're a part of the cool crowd of New York City comes at a high price. For a more down-to-earth Mexican experience, check out my Searching for a Good Taco food project, but if you want to be seen and heard, La Esquina is still one of those places.

Right outside our Chinatown office, a line forms late in the afternoon in front of a Chinese man's supermarket cart loaded with a huge pail of black liquid. I took a peek once and realized that hard-boiled eggs were floating in it. I've heard of tea eggs before but I've never had them, so the last time I walked by the cart, I bought six tea eggs for a dollar. My Chinese friend Shao told me she grew up eating them whenever her parents would make them at home. I've read that they are traditionally a Chinese New Year snack, but nowadays people line up for them whenever they feel like eating eggs. Back at home, I took the eggs out of the plastic bag, put them in a bowl and disposed the liquid. I noticed that the shells were a little bit cracked. When I took the shells off, the cracked shell made a pretty pattern on the egg. I did some research and found out that the marinade has soy sauce, star anise and cinnamon sticks together with the brewed black tea. The hard-boiled eggs are tapped gently in order for the shells to crack a little bit and then simmered in the marinade for an hour or two so that the black color stains the shell and the cooked egg inside, leaving that ornate pattern. Eating hard-boiled eggs past noon might be weird to some people, but I had one while I was making dinner and I thought it was a lovely treat to keep the hunger pangs from gnawing.

46-48 in the Chinatown Arcade between Canal and Bayard 212/964.0284 about $25 for two, without drinks, without tip ♥ ♥ Don't let the hard-to-pronounce items on the menu stop you from ordering food from New Malaysia. For my first visit, I ordered the more traditional nasi lemak and the roti canai just to be on the safe side. After those two dishes, I knew I had to come back with a bigger stomach. When Anna's Malaysian friend told me that New York has the best Malaysian food, I raised an eyebrow. I don't know many Malaysian restaurants in the city except for the so-so Jaya on Baxter and the Indo-Malay Nyonya and Penang franchises, so I was willing to try New Malaysia as soon as I could. I was more adventurous during my second visit and I ordered the asam laksa, a spicy and sour soup with lemongrass broth and crushed sardines. If it weren't so salty, it would be my new anti-cold soup of choice. Too bad it doesn't come in a smaller bowl. The kang kung belacan is stewed in shrimp and anchovy paste, much like how Filipinos cook the swamp vegetable (spelled kang kong). It seems a little steep for $8 a plate but we cleaned it off even with four other dishes.

The wind was howling in New York City this week. All I wanted was something warm, thick and filling for dinner. This stems from two yellow curry recipes, one with chicken and one with fish balls because who says you can't have it all? I visited the newly-renovated Asia Market on Mulberry at the corner of Bayard and found everything I needed. Feel free to toss in any hard vegetable you have in the fridge. Just make sure you cook them first before the softer ones. Cauliflower and zucchini would be fun to add, too; perhaps even baby corn. At home, the curry paste cooking in peanut oil will release one of my favorite smells in the kitchen. Ingredients: boneless chicken thighs, cut in small pieces a pack of fish balls, thawed a pack of cuttlefish balls, thawed 1 cup of coconut cream 1 cup of vegetable stock a handful of green beans 4 Thai eggplants, sliced in half moons 1 Japanese eggplant, chopped 1 red bell pepper, roughly chopped cilantro, roughly chopped For the yellow curry paste: 2 red chilies 1 tsp black peppercorns coriander root, peeled and thinly sliced 1 tsp cumin seeds 1 tsp fennel seeds 1 tbsp ground turmeric 1 small knob of ginger, peeled and thinly sliced 3 cloves of garlic, crushed 1 small red onion, chopped 1 lemongrass stalk, white part only, pounded with a pestle 1 tsp of sambal oelek shrimp paste, to taste 2 tbsps peanut oil 1. In a large wok, heat the peanut oil. Make the curry paste by sautéing all the curry ingredients and cooking them until fragrant, about 3 minutes. 2. Add the chicken, green beans, pepper and the Thai eggplants with the coconut cream and stock. Cover in medium heat until chicken is cooked and the vegetables are tender, about 8 minutes. 3. Add the cilantro and the softer eggplants and cook for a few more minutes. The peanut oil should be separating from the curry paste. Make sure you keep stirring to distribute the heat and add more stock to keep the sauce from drying up. Add shrimp paste to adjust the taste. Related post/s: Buy all the ingredients in Chinatown

86 Mulberry Street between Canal and Bayard 212/577.8887 $18 for two, without drinks, without tip ♥ ♥ ♥ Anthony Bourdain once said that most people know that Vietnamese food is good but they just don't have a clue how good. In New York City, it's hard to find a really good Vietnamese place. I used to have a few favorite spots in Chinatown, but lately, they've gotten lazy about making the pho. You rarely get that beefy taste in the broth anymore. The pho at Xe Lua not only taste beefy, they are gigantic. For less than $6, it is a good lunch deal which will surely warm the senses. Their broth oozes with flavor; it's full, rich and tasty. The rice dishes are promising, too. The chicken served with mixed vegetables in lemongrass sauce tasted as good as it sounded. The crispy squid shared as an appetizer is indeed crispy. Even though it comes with brown sauce, you can still taste the squid. With its vellum business card and witty menu-sections are divided as Porky, Chicken Little, Where's the Beef? and No Meat Allow-Xe Lua is obviously the youngest Vietnamese joint in Chinatown. The bamboo bridge connecting the front to the main dining room with cloud-painted walls and water fountain are hokey, but Xe Lua is still trying to impress the neighborhood and I'm happy to give them the chance.

If your ever in Houston there is a large Vietnamese community, many, many Vietnamese restaurants along Bellaire st, in the southwest part of the city. . .lots to choose from-But, still my most favorite is KIM SON (there's several, but the best is the one near downtown Houston), also have fast efficient service--and even, at a moments notice, can seat 50 plus people quite easily.

Finger Lakes Wine Trail

***CONTENT
After doing the Long Island wine trail, we immediately scheduled a trip up the Finger Lakes region in New York. We had to postpone it once because of the Dr.'s, schedule but after finally making the trip over the weekend, I was glad we waited until the leaves turned all sorts of fall colors. He recently got another golden weekend and I was able to convince him, with promises only a girlfriend can make, that he should drive the six hours upstate. The Yates Chamber of Commerce gave me three places with availability after I tried calling several hotels and B&Bs in vain. If I didn't call the Robertson House, I wouldn't have known that they had another property for rent not listed on their Web site. On Friday, we started our long drive early, but ended up getting stuck in traffic around Scranton, Pennsylvania, home of Dunder Mifflin, Inc. We didn't make it to the lake house until 10:30pm. Jane and Paul Robertson left the heat on to prepare for our arrival, so when we entered the house, it was all warm and toasty. We settled in, opened and drank a bottle of red wine we brought with us and sat talking for two more hours before we fell asleep. When I woke up the next morning, I took a peek outside and saw what the Robertsons were talking about-peaceful Keuka Lake and red, yellow, orange, brown maple trees. It was so dark and quiet the night before that I had no clue the view was going to be incredible. We had breakfast back at the Robertson's main house before we started our drive around Seneca Lake to visit some of the local wineries. Besides the local Reislings I'm familiar with, we didn't really know much about the other wines and vineyards. We randomly chose from a big list but stuck around Seneca Lake and skipped the scattered ones around Keuka and Cayuga. Following are what we tasted with some of the notes I scribbled on my book. We started at Fox Run Vineyards where it was already a zoo at 11:30am. They were offering four complimentary tastings: 1. 2005 Reserve Chardonnay -- ten months in oak with vanilla notes at the end 2. 2002 Cabernet Franc -- bone-dry and not as spicy as other Cabernet Francs we're used to 3. 2004 Sable -- fruity wine from Cabernet grapes we imagined would be good with some cheese 4. Ruby Vixen -- very peachy; the sweetest wine from their vineyard We also paid $2 for extra tastings of the following: 1. 2005 Dry Reisling -- apricot 2. 2005 Reisling -- semi-dry; more like candy than fruit 3. Arctic Fox -- a Reisling and Chardonnay blend; we ended up getting a case of this because it would be an outstanding table wine with almost anything Another separate $2 fee gave us a taste of the 2005 Reserve Reisling which smelled better than the dry Reisling and with a cleaner finish. For $30 a bottle though, we skipped it. Our next stop was at Hermann J. Wiemer Vineyard. Their 2005 dry Reisling was recently voted New York's best wine. (I had my first taste last year and I ended up buying half a case of that winner.) We tasted a lot of their wines, but nothing really overwhelmed us so we only bought several bottles for friends: 1. Dry Rose Pinot Noir/Chardonnay -- strong at the end for a rose 2. Pinot Noir -- very light yet complicated; we would have bought several of these if a bottle wasn't $35 each 3. Late Harvest Reisling -- like juice; yummy and sweet 4. Cabernet Franc -- a lot of alcohol (which could be a good thing, I suppose) 5. Estate Red -- a blend of Cabernet Franc, Pinot Noir and Lemberger; very tart 6. Select Late Harvest Reisling -- like candy but yummier than the late harvest We stopped by Lakewood Vineyards where it was even more of a party room than a tasting room. Everyone was part of a tour so there were plenty of screaming and shouting, both from the staff trying to do their spiel about the wines and the tasters who drink the wines as if they were shots of Tequila. Their 2004 Chardonnay was pretty anemic although the vanilla at the end was quite nice. The 2005 Long Stem Red was a hybrid of four grapes but it still lacked character. The 2002 Pinot Noir had a licorice taste to it. The Borealis Ice Wine was like drinking Welch's grape juice. We did like the 2004 Cabernet Franc because it was dry upfront and it pleasantly went on for a while. For lunch, we stopped by the dock to check out the menus from the different restaurants by the water but were not impressed. Before getting something to eat at Stonecat Café, we had a pretty nice experience at the Atwater Vineyard for $2 per person: 1. 2002 Estate Selection Chardonnay -- 13 months in oak; pretty complicated 2. 2005 Gewürztraminer -- didn’t smell so good 3. 2005 Reisling -- easy-drinking that would be perfect for a hot, summer afternoon but alas, it's not hot out anymore 4. 2005 Reserve Reisling -- fruitier and gummier; almost chewable 5. 2004 Cabernet Franc -- tasted like buttered popcorn but more like currant afterward 6. 2004 Cabernet Merlot -- new release; well-balanced and tasty 7. 2003 Meritage -- almost no tannins and very easy to drink 8. Estate White -- we bought several bottles of these; crisp, light, citrus-y The Stonecat Café is on the same grounds as the Bloomer Creek Vineyard. We had the pizette topped with mixed greens, goat cheese and pancetta. The Dr. had the cornmeal-breaded catfish sandwich. We asked for the green pepper salsa out of curiosity because they were charging an extra dollar for it. I couldn't stop slathering it on my pizza even though I was tearing up. It was fierce! I don't know if it was because of all those peppers but we felt like we found some great wines afterwards at Lamoreaux Landing. Everything we tasted was better than everything else we've had: 1. 2004 Chardonnay -- very drinkable with pineapple notes 2. 2005 Dry Reisling -- a tasty wine that led to a cover on Wine Spectator last May 3. Estate White -- a blend of Reisling and Chardonnay with pear and other tropical fruits 4. 2005 Gewürztraminer -- good aroma and grapefruit taste 5. 2000 Brut Sparkling Wine -- dry but creamy 6. 2005 Vidal Ice Wine -- syrupy when pouring; overwhelmingly sweet We haven't been liking the red wines, but we were also pretty pleased with the Lamoreaux selections: 1. Estate Red -- a blend of Pinot, Merlot and Cabernet Franc; strawberry and jammy 2. 2003 Merlot -- floral mouth 3. Non Vintage Cabernet Franc -- pine resin; less tarty than the other Cabernet Francs we've tasted earlier 4. 2004 Pinot Noir -- complicated with a clove taste We pretty much gave up after putting several more bottles in the trunk and went back to the lake house to unwind. Dinner was uneventful at Sarasin's, a restaurant by Keuka Lake with a giant ship wheel outside. After almost 790 miles over the weekend and 12 hours of driving to and from the city-without any contribution from me-we have about twenty bottles of Chardonnays and Reislings. White is usually not the type you'd reach for in autumn, but we learned a great deal upstate. Reislings don't always have to taste like dessert in a glass and that you can even cook with them and Chardonnay could be excellent with some curry dishes. The Finger Lakes might not have exciting food selections just yet, but I'm sure our wines will keep us full this season. Related post/s: Finger Lakes Map Trail Finger Lakes photos on Flickr

I misplaced a Mark Bittman recipe from The Times I saved two weeks ago. Now that I have a nice bottle of Reisling to cook with after visiting the Finger Lakes wine trail and plenty of firm apples to buy at the market, I was adamant to replicate it with some guess-timates. I still had some leftover thyme in the fridge kept fresh by the best thing in the world right now-Glad Press'n Seal-so I threw those in while the juices cooked the pork. We drank the rest of the Lamoreaux Landing Reisling with this and ate it with broiled white potatoes. Ingredients: 6 pork steaks, about 1 inch thick, cut from the shoulder 3 Gala apples, cored and sliced 1/2 cup of Bordeaux or any other semi-heavy red 1/2 cup of dry Reisling 1 medium red onion, thinly sliced half a stick of butter 2 sprigs of thyme salt and pepper 1. Rub the steaks with salt and pepper. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat for 3 minutes. Add the butter and brown the pork on both sides, about 4 minutes. Do this in batches to avoid overcrowding the pan. 2. Reduce the heat to medium. Add the red wine and the onion and cook, turning the pork once or twice, until the wine is all but evaporated, about 3 minutes. 3. Add some water if the sauce is a little too thick, turn the heat to low and cover. Cook for 10 minutes, turning them once or twice, until the pork is tender but not dry. Remove the pork to a plate. 4. Add the apples in the remaining liquid, stirring and scraping the bottom of the pan as the apples cook. Add the Reisling and simmer in low fire until the apples absorb most of the liquid. Return the meat to the pan during the last few minutes to reheat them.

1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Combine a large pinch of salt with a few grindings of pepper, the cayenne and garlic, and sprinkle apples with this mixture. Put apples in a baking dish, pour white wine around them, and bake until apples are shriveled but moist, about 15 minutes. 2. Meanwhile, heat oil over medium heat in a skillet large enough to hold pork. Dust pork lightly with flour and sear it on both sides for a total of just a minute or so; it need not become brown. Add red wine and adjust heat so mixture boils energetically. Cook pork, turning occasionally, until it gains a beautiful deep color, is cooked through and wine reduces to a syrup; about 10 minutes. Season meat with salt and pepper. 3. Serve pork with red wine sauce spooned over it, next to apples, with a little of the white wine they cooked in. Yield: 4 servings.

Whoa. Thanks. Not so bad, eh? I usually skip the flour when I brown meats anyway. That cayenne pepper is interesting though.

Anna picked us up from our hotel and drove us to Maxwell Street where a few avenues are blocked every Sunday to set up a market and food fair. It was hard to find parking but as soon as we started walking around, we couldn't help but feel like we were in another country. I've always liked visiting markets whenever I'm traveling, and in Chicago, Maxwell Street is the place to be if you need duct tape, electric cords, Mexican beads, Guadalupe posters, tomatillos, peppers and of course, tacos and tamales. The sight and the different smells were intoxicating. There wasn't a cloud in the sky. It was the perfect day to be bargaining for a Lucha Libre mask. I tried not to eat too many tacos from one stand lest I miss out on the other offerings down the block. From the first stand, we had chorizo tacos. They were deliciously salty with mad cilantro and lime juice. They were the beginning of a beautiful afternoon. Then we moved on to the next where I had lengua, or tongue. It was so soft and the green salsa kept it juicy. The next stand only sold beef tacos. The beef had been stewing in some thick sauce, so the meat fell apart at every bite. It was a delicious mess. I had the squash blossom taco next, but it was too funky to finish. I think it had been sitting in the bowl for a while so it didn't taste fresh, but the pork barbeque taco was pretty good. We also picked up a glass of the crushed iced lime juice from another stand. About an hour later, we were very full and happy, but I still bought a pork tamale to take with me to the airport. For the love of tacos, we missed our scheduled flight.

I just returned from my third trip to Chicago and I think I've got the city down pat. Three years ago, the Dr. and I made it to the Art Institute, the Shedd Aquarium and the MoCA. Last December, we visited the Chicago Cultural Center and ate Persian, Colombian, Japanese, Mexican and Scandinavian. We also had some awesome hotdogs at Hot Doug's and a really memorable meal at Charlie Trotter's. This year, four of us from work went all out at Alinea, most recently named the number one restaurant by Gourmet magazine. Like for every other restaurant I've visited, I booked our table before my airline tickets. To simply say that the food was good is an understatement. Tyler used the word \"delicate\" and even \"fragile\" to describe our experience. I need a very special dictionary to define my reaction to each dish that was served-all twelve courses-but even if I had one, I would still have a hard time picking the perfect adjectives. They called this the hot potato-cold potato because of the two ways the potato is served. A black truffle tops the potato and cubes of parmesan decorate the stick. This was matched with H. Billot Grand Cru Brut Rosé from Ambonnay, France. Our server had to hold the bowl for me while I took the photograph because the fork was too heavy for the bowl to stand on its own. One small mouthful of the yellowtail brought out the taste of the radish, coriander and poppyseed combined. The next course was trout roe with cucumber, coconut and bonito matched with Bodegas Naia \"Naiades\" Verdejo from Rueda, Spain but unfortunately, I don't have a photo of that. The matsutake mushroom with mango, peanut and yuzu glass came in a glass and our servers spilled its contents on our plates. It was matched with Gerovassiliou Malagousia from Epanomi, Greece. Next was the rabbit with cider, roasted garlic and smell of burning oak leaves-probably the coolest thing ever. I've had rabbit before but the Chef Grant Achatz way was served covered with a glass filled with smoke. The server lifted the glass to let the smoke escape and we were presented with a piece of rabbit with an earthy smell. Actually, the peach with smoked paprika and carrot might have been cooler than the rabbit. It was called an explosion. It was served in a small glass and we had to drink it like a shot. The golf ball-sized shell broke oh-so-delicately in our mouths and exploded with the contents inside. Short rib with ribboned beets, geléed cranberry and campari matched with Cabanon Bonarda \"Boisee\" from Oltrepò Pavese, Italy. Short rib with beets? Sure. But ribboned beets? Who thinks about stuff like that? The dish was just another example of the crazy kind of genius behind the food. There was a reason for the rosemary sprigs on our table after all besides a weird centerpiece. Before the dishes were served, they rearranged them to face toward us. When the sizzling platforms were served with the lamb searing on top, the smoke engulfed the rosemary and created that smell we're all familiar with. The lamb came with date and mastic and matched with Prats & Symington \"Chryseia\" from Douro, Portugal. I've had rare squab before and once we had to return it and asked the kitchen to cook it for a few more minutes. This squab was soft, almost buttery. If it weren't for that offal-like taste, you would have guessed it was a nice beef steak. This was squab with huckleberry, sorrel and long peppercorn. The Bilancia \"Hawke's Bay\" Syrah from New Zealand was a good match. And then the desserts started to come: Concord grape, frozen and chewy. This was cooked in PolyScience's AntiGriddle, a patent pending “cooking” surface that freezes almost anything because of its ability to achieve temperatures below -50ºF. Chestnut with Blis maple syrup eaten with a small metal matchstick. Crabapple with cheddar, eucalyptus and olive oil matched with Muller-Catoir Haardter Mandelring Scheurebe Spatlese from Pfalz. I love desserts like this: tart enough to cleanse the palate and not overwhelmingly sweet. Chocolate with bergamot, cassia and figs matched with De Bartoli \"Bukkuram\" Moscato Passito di Pantelleria from Italy. Alas, I'm not a big fan of chocolate overload but I appreciated this dish as much as the entire table; I just couldn't finish it. Caramel with meyer lemon and tempura served in what looked like one those head massagers I found in Barcelona. A burning cinnamon stick protruding on top was lit like a birthday candle. The service was attentive yet more relaxed that at The French Laundry. While we waited for our table to be set up, we were served complimentary champagne downstairs past the doors which opened with a wave of your hand. Upstairs, the dark wood and warm lighting made us feel like we were in someone's apartment-someone rich, someone with taste, someone we knew! The waiters and servers in their Ermenegildo Zegna suits were so comfortable telling us about the courses even though each dish got more ridiculous (in a good way, of course). They laughed with us but also answered all our questions. Are the dishes made especially for the restaurant? (Some are retail but the more sculpture-like serviceware are created by Crucial Detail.) How do you freeze grape? (AntiGriddle.) May I go to the bathroom? (It's best to wait because the next course is coming up and it takes about twelve minutes to burn the leaves.) We didn't know what to expect with each course. They could have told us anything and we would have followed like obedient guests. (We will now blindfold you while you eat. Sure!) The sommelier's skills came through with his incredible pairings. Sure, French, Spanish and Italian wines are a given, but Greek? I would have never picked that on my own. He opened our palate to different kinds of wines which made us appreciate the style of cooking that the chef was trying to get across. Alinea is at 1723 North Halsted in Chicago, Illinois. Call 312/867.0110 a month ahead to make reservations.

370 Columbus Avenue off 78th Street 212/362.4816 $130 for two, with three drinks, with tip ♥ I was craving sushi but did not want to go home too late, so I looked for a sushi place around the upper west side. I found Gari on Columbus Avenue with all its Frank Bruni and Food & Wine writeups on the window and I thought, this could be promising. Because we walked in without a reservation, we weren't able to sit at the bar. I love ordering the omakase only if I can talk to the sushi chef so that I can watch what's he's doing. For ten pieces at about $65 (about $75 if you also want sashimi), I opted for the sushi-by-piece instead. This is my only problem with Gari: the price. We started with the octopus ceviche but I only counted four slivers of octopus in my glass bowl; that comes out about $3 a sliver. I ordered the shrimp and crab rolls because it included woodear mushrooms. I needed to take the rolls apart to look for the mushrooms. I know it's du jour to be all minimalist, but I'm hungry! The sushi was pretty good. We ordered our usual favorites: fatty tuna, yellowtail, mackerel, smelt roe with quail egg, fluke and shad. The $14 roll of uni, though, was questionnable. It was fresh but it looked like it was whipped so they ended up looking like melted Kraft cheese. Was this a Zen presentation or was it to save on the uni? The damage with two Sapporos and a glass of Prosecco? $130 for two people. I went home and all I wanted was fried chicken. Next time, I'll stay in midtown and go back to Sushiden.

During a recent visit to the farmers' market, there was an abundant choice of root vegetables. I had this conversation with Cameron before where we had to draw on the office whiteboard what we thought were radishes and turnips. Filipino radishes are long and thick like white carrots, while American ones are the size of pink golf balls. Filipino turnips are bulb-looking things with a tough light brown peel, while the American version sometimes has a pink shade to it. Then there are the parsnips that don't even exist in Filipino vocabulary but look more like our radishes. Cameron now thinks Filipinos are just weird. It gets all convoluted. I'm sure the terminology is interchangable, but a trip to the farmers' market sure was a nice lesson. These were called radishes even though they were the size of small thumbs-the shape is Filipino, the color American. They definitely tasted more like the American radishes with that sharp bite at the end. A jig of really good balsamic vinegar can balance out that kick. Chop them in small pieces and they make a good substitute for pretzels when you're drinking beer. These were called Japanese turnips, with a smooth peel, and sweet, fleshy meat inside. I liked eating these raw and they matched well with some spicy arugula. And then I got these two things because I couldn't stop myself from smelling them. I find it curious when people tell me they hate cilantro in their food, but then don't mind ordering an Indian dish sprinkled with coriander seeds. Not too many people know they're the same; I just know the cookbooks I've purchased in Europe always refer to them as coriander, while American markets always use cilantro on labels. The leaves of the bunch I bought looked like frisée. They're called delfino, a more aromatic cilantro version.

I think most of the time 'coriander' refers to only the seeds, and 'cilantro' refers to leaves -- two very distinct tastes but sometimes the terms are used interchangeably.

Yeah, I think that separation is the American way. My English cookbooks mention \"coriander leaves\" and one recipe even says \"coriander stalks\".

Hungry when I woke up one Sunday afternoon with a developing cold, I searched for leftovers in the fridge to nourish myself. There was a bowl of fried ground beef. The folks love making their own tacos at home so I'm bound to find ground meat at any time during the week. And when they're too lazy to buy salad greens from the farmers' market, I also find iceberg lettuce from the neighborhood grocery store in some sad plastic bag in the fridge. I thought about Buddhai Bodai in Chinatown, where they have this one dish I always order called Lettuce Song. Using the leftovers, I tried to replicate that taste even though I probably came up with a whole new salad recipe. It was still a delicious dish and it put the already-cooked ground beef to good use. If you have fresh bean sprouts, they add nicely to the crunchiness of the lettuce. Ingredients: 1/2 pound of ground beef half a small head of iceberg lettuce, cut into strips 1 pack of vermicelli noodles half a bunch of cilantro, finely chopped 1/2 cup fish sauce juice from 2 limes 1 tsp brown sugar 2 garlic cloves, finely chopped 2 shallots, finely chopped 2 tbsps peanut oil 1 tsp sesame oil red chili flakes 1. In a frying pan over medium heat, sauté garlic and shallots in hot peanut oil. Add ground beef and brown. Stir and scrape the bottom of the pan ocassionally to avoid from sticking and burning. Remove to a salad bowl. 2. In a small bowl, dissolve sugar in fish sauce. Whisk in sesame oil. Add chili flakes to taste. 3. In the meantime, boil a pot of water. Add noodles and cook for less than 5 minutes. Drain and let cool with running water. Using a fork, separate noodles to avoid from sticking and forming into clumps. 4. When ready to serve, add the noodles to the ground beef and pour over dressing. Toss with the lettuce to combine.

I spent my Friday afternoon at Kam Nam in Chinatown buying the necessary tools: plastic pail, check; cleaver, check. I perused my Fergus Henderson book for a brine recipe but I had to make a few adjustments because I didn't have juniper berries on hand. The Dr. cut Rog in several sections to make him fit in the pail. Twenty-four hours later, he was ready to go to Williamsburg. (The Dr. went, too.) When I first ordered Rog, I immediately thought of Chef George Weld of egg. I knew he would appreciate it and I knew he would want to partake in eating a suckling pig. He's a busy man but he made time over the weekend to cook and welcome us to their home in Brooklyn. The head was cooked with carrots and celery. One of the legs was pan-fried before hitting the oven. The loins, well, they were just roasted to perfection. By the time we sat down to eat, we've already consumed two bottles of wine. We made my Brussels sprouts with bacon salad, added a bowl of nice turnips and radishes and opened two more bottles of red. I've never seen a nicer plate of pig. Rog's meat was very succulent and tasty-the product of just eating acorns in the farm where he came from. His meat was naturally flavorful and because the chef gave his full attention, his skin was golden and crispy. We had a few servings of each part. The loin was everyone's favorite, of course, but we had a stab of the neck meat which was definitely more substantial and bloody-tasting, and the leg which was more lean. We thank Rog for letting us enjoy him the way he's supposed to be enjoyed. We believe he served his ultimate purpose.

54 East 1st Street between First and Second Avenues 212/677.6221 about $75 for three, without drinks, without tip ♥ ♥ Prune's selections are influenced by different cuisines and that's exactly what I liked about Chef Gabrielle Hamilton's style. The tripe is a must-try even though you don't like tripe. In Barcelona, I ate a lot of tripe. Prune's version is Milenese, topped with a delicate dollop of pesto and shredded cheese. It's light but beefy at the same time. I only wished it was served with country bread so I can scoop up the sauce. The skate wing comes with capers; simple and understated. Now, can we talk about the roast beef? I don't think I've ever tasted anything as good. It's soft, it's bloody and just so damn tasty. Both dishes came with potato slaw sprinkled with Hungarian peppercorns. You crush them with each bite and then there's that burst of spicyness which gives the side dish its entire personality. We made room for the thick homemade apple pie with buttermilk ice cream. It was the perfect way to end a nice long lunch. The golden-brown sugared crust was such a treat. I've always wanted to go to Prune but could never make myself walk over to the east side when I'm deciding where to go for dinner. I also don't wake up early enough to make it downtown for a weekend brunch. When they announced that they are finally serving lunch during the week, I had no excuses left. I've seen a line outside Prune during warmer nights, but it was quiet when we walked in on a Friday afternoon. There was ample natural light which makes you just want to sit back and stay. Prune was the chef's childhood nickname, but I can easily call it Home. Updated, 2007: There was a long line for Sunday brunch even though it was almost 3pm. We decided to wait for 15 minutes next door with our iced coffees. We walked back to check if we can finally get a table, but we were told that we have to wait another twenty minutes. I was grouchy and hungry, so I told the Dr. that I can't wait any longer. We started to walk away from Prune when I heard the maitre d' call my name. She said she was going to seat us in the next five minutes and asked us to wait just a bit more until they clean the table that just emptied. I appreciated the fact that the maitre d' just didn't let us walk away. She could have easily picked any of the other couples waiting outside. We were lucky to be squeezed in and so we celebrated with bloody marys, stewed chickpeas, lamb sausages and a ham and cheese sandwich.

53 West 19th Street between Fifth and Sixth Avenues 212/255-4160 about $100 for two, with a few drinks, without tip ♥ Arabella and I discussed dinner options and cravings one evening: I am Frenched out for the moment (her) and Can we keep it chill? (me). Tapas, an eating concept from the Basque Country, could be anything bite-sized on a small plate. It's not French and it's definitely the most laid-back way I can think of in terms of eating dinner, so to Boqueria we went. I am still reeling from my Catalan vacation and because I had lunch at the boqueria three times while I was in Barcelona, eating pintxos (pin-chos) was an easy pick. The quail egg was fried and served on top of a sausage sliver and a crispy baguette. It needed a good drizzle of olive oil. I liked the idea of a date stuffed with almonds wrapped in bacon, but then again, I like anything with bacon. The squid was served with a handful of limp mixed greens; perhaps stewed chick peas could have made the dish more lively. The consolation, however, was the service. The place got crowded as it got later but our bartender-server made sure she gave us her attention. She was very patient with the mixed crowd: one actually opened up his laptop at the bar and another kept screaming for a Syrah until she politely explained that he was in a Spanish bar. Men in suits kept bumping our backs with their obnoxious laptop murses, so she made us stay by comping a glass of white and a glass of sangria. Although the space is very sleek and the buzz infectious, the food at this Boqueria could be a little more inspired.

501 11th street off Seventh Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn 718/768.2044 $160 for two, with several drinks, with tip ♥ ♥ ♥ I believe it's called skill when a chef can take a cheap cut of veal and mask it as if it's not part of the animal's chewy shoulder. And I believe that it's only a sincere love for food that can make a lamb loin taste, not like lamb, but of the combination of the complementary ingredients with it. An amuse of roasted red beets with bloodoranges was a good start to a nicely-paced dinner at Applewood. The beets were tender but gave softly in my mouth. A seared Maine scallop sat in soup; I was only disappointed that I didn't have a spoon to slurp all of it. A braised Vermont pork belly was crunchy and yet so delicate with the tiny pieces of eggplant, my smile stretched past my ears. The lamb loin was soft and really tasted like a nice cut of beef especially with the slightly bitter daikon and the creamy (but a little too salty) polenta. And veal shoulder, an inexpensive cut meant to be braised for hours, was naturally chewy but it was presented with such skill that you accept it just the way nature intended it. We ended the night with a small muffin of almond cake and it came with Seckel pear, the miniature sweet-sour kind excellent for cooking. A much bigger dessert, nectarine cobbler, was eaten until the last crumb was unseen. Treading to Brooklyn for dinner is an ordeal for us Harlem residents, but we are well aware of the restaurants cropping up in support of sustainable local products and we are slowly making our way to eating in the outer boroughs. Applewood, for the last two years, has been changing their menu daily to ensure the freshness and seasonality of the ingredients. (An onion martini is a must-have before dinner is served.) An otherwise quiet Tuesday night dinner became special.

120 Lexington Avenue corner of 28th Street 212/532.3663 $65 for two, without drinks, with tip ♥ Mirch is loosely translated as spicy in Hindi and the combination of Sichuan and Cantonese cuisines happily bring out the intense flavor of Indian cooking. The positive is that the dishes are lighter than what I am used to because pork and beef are not in the menu in honor of the Muslim and Hindi diets. The negative is that the distinctive flavor of all the cuisines combined may be too much for a diner with a less friendly stomach. Indeed, mine protested when I got home-three times. We ordered the lime coriander soup which was deliciously sour for me. It was clear broth but a little gooey, perhaps a little cornstarch made it so. This is exactly what the Chinese Indian combination was like throughout our entire meal-saucy and spicy. We also had their notorious chicken lollipops, wing meat pulled back to form a ball at the other end of the bone. My brother makes them at home but the Mirch version has enough garlic to make them addicting. They're deep-fried to crunchy perfection that I had to order one serving to go so that my father can taste them. The deep-fried okra were served in a container fit for Belgian fries and each okra sliver was coated in batter and peppered with paprika and other chili spices. The vegetarian meatballs were quite good, too, and even after eating one of the green chiles swimming in even more sauce, we were still craving for more. The chicken and garlic noodles were satisfying although the chicken bits were barely detectable. I loved pouring the vinegar that was on our table over them. The waiters are friendly but the service is abrupt. Our waiter tried to take plates away twice even though we were still eating. He also tipped over the okra container to see if we were done with them that I was tempted to slap him on the arm so he would chill. We ordered a bowl of rice when the two main courses were served but it never came. When it was included in our bill and I alerted the cashier, they insisted that we ate the rice they brought to our table. Our waiter pointed to a small grain of rice on our table and asked, But what is this over here? as if we would really try to skip over paying $1.39. They let the bill stand, as I suggested, and I gave them $1.39 less on the tip. Can you blame me if I just didn't want to pay for what wasn't served? The waiters also let us leave without giving us the leftovers we asked to take home. It was a good thing we remembered half a block away. When we opened our bag, the new order of chicken lollipops were there (I ordered two but they only gave and charged me for one) but the leftover noodles weren't. We were just too tired to correct another mistake that we just decided to walk away.

My father denies that he bought the Mario Batali extra large Dutch oven for me. He said he bought it for himself so he can make his Filipino specialties without crowding the smaller pots we already have. I'll let him slide, but to christen his new and glistening red pot, I braised some oxtails and kicked off autumn. Braising has got to be one my favorites things to do. A little beefy wine, a little stock, some good meat-you can just leave everything in the oven for a couple of hours. Browning is the key and it's the step that a lot of Filipinos skip-they love their pressure cooker too much. When the meat falls off the bone without force, it's like Christmas. If you love to cook, I think you have to give in some of your time to do beautiful things like this. Ingredients: 6 pieces of oxtails red wine beef broth 1/2 stick of butter 1 red onion 5 garlic cloves, crushed 2 leeks, white parts only, chopped 2 celery ribs, chopped 1 medium carrot, chopped 3 thyme sprigs 3 bay leaves 1 bunch parsley stems 1. Preheat oven to 350º. Meanwhile in a large Dutch oven, add some butter over medium heat until foam subsides and brown the oxtails on all sides, about 20 minutes. Transfer to a plate. 2. Add vegetables to the pot and sauté until softened. Add the oxtails back arranging them in one layer. Add wine, herbs and enough stock to cover the oxtails. Bring to a boil, turn off the heat and place inside the oven on the middle rack and braise until meat is tender and almost falling off the bone, about 2 hours. 3. Remove the oxtails to a plate. Pour the braising liquid through a fine sieve into a saucepan and discard the other solids. Boil liquid until thick and reduced. Serve with pasta. Related post/s: Other oxtail recipes

232 Elizabeth Street between Houston and Prince 212/625.2345 $57 for one, with four drinks, with tip ♥ ♥ Both times I've eaten at Bar Bossa, I sat in the back room with a group of friends where bathroom visitors always say, Oh, I didn't know there was a table back here. Sitting in the back is like sitting in someone's cozy and well-lit home where the whiff of the good food about to come out from the kitchen floats around. You can reserve the back ahead of time, but in one of our visits, we walked in and were accommodated without any problems. (Check out the soap in the bathroom as I'm sure it will be a topic of conversation at your table.) I've also dined at the bar alone-yes, I was very proud of myself, too-and I enjoy their fish entree with braised tomatoes. The owners are English and Brazilian but the Latinos in the kitchen run the show, churning out specials like pork chops with chayote, pineapple and potato peppered with crispy sausage and breaded beef steak with rice and watercress. Their offerings play on all kinds of cuisine: baked crab meat in a clam shell, beef carpaccio on a bed of mixed greens and even Italian paninis. Several cocktails and a bottle of wine later, even the assorted desserts taste good: bananas baked in coconut, Guiness chocolate cake, passion fruit-flavored sponge cake with whipped cream. The bar is proud of their caipirinhas which come in different flavors. With the amount of liquor they put in them, they have no reason not to be.

One Fifth Avenue on 8th Street 212/995.9559 $90 for three, with several drinks, with tip ♥ ♥ When a group of my friends and I just want a laid-back night with good food but can't afford the other Batali establishments, we end up at Otto where we can eat thin-crust pizzas cooked on a flat-iron griddle. My favorite is the funghi and taleggio pizza with earthy mushrooms and fragrant taleggio cheese. The fennel with bottarga, or Italian caviar, showered with mozarella and pecorino pizza is also delicious. For those who want something more familiar, the classic marinara and pepperoni pizzas are also available as well as smaller pasta dishes like penne, spaghetti and linguine. We spend most of our money in antipasti like prosciutto, octopus, tomato and mozarella salad and the anchovies. The service is brisk especially when the place is hopping on weekends. If you prefer to skip the dining room, there are tables at the bar where you can just stand and hover over your food and Italian wine. During one visit, our waiter bumped into our table and spilled water all over my brother's lap. They apologized by bringing him a complimentary beer and dessert afterwards. It's not Babbo, but your wallet will gladly thank you for it. Related post/s: Babbo

I bought The Food of Spain and Portugal to skim through during my flight back from Barcelona and made marks to the recipes I'd like to test at home. Not wanting to let go of our Catalan experience just yet, I picked Extramadura's puchero de castañas con garbanzos, or chestnut and chickpea hotpot to get that comforting feeling we had when we ate chickpeas at almost every tapas bar in Barcelona. This recipe needs a little bit of planning ahead to soak the chickpeas and chestnuts overnight. I used the Goya chickpeas from the grocery store. As for the chestnuts, there's plenty in Chinatown that's packaged dry, but I wanted the ones soaked in water because I didn't get the chance to soak them with the chickpeas. (Note that chestnuts in water is different from water chestnuts!) At Dean and Deluca, I bought a $9.50 can of Clement Faugier whole chestnuts in water, a French brand-a little steep but that's why I said you should plan ahead. There are plenty of smoked ham hocks in my grocery store for less than $2 and because I only used them to flavor the broth, I didn't feel too bad about throwing them out after cooking. The dried pimento peppers I found at Despaña for $1.50 in a small box. They were chewy after cooking so I just discarded them, too. The temperature dropped down to 65 on my way home and it was a little bit chilly. Coming home to make this hotpot with a couple of glasses of Shinn Estate's Red was what I just needed to wind down. It is great with country bread from Balthazar. Ingredients: half a 1-pound package of chickpeas, soaked overnight in water, drained 1 can of chestnuts in water, drained 1 smoked ham hock 1 packaged of bacon, chopped 2 garlic cloves, crushed 2 ribs of celery, chopped 3 dried pimento peppers, seeded and torn 3 whole cloves 1 bay leaf 1/2 tsp crushed peppercorns 2 hardboiled eggs a handful of shiitake mushrooms, wiped off clean and chopped parsley, finely chopped thyme salt, pepper, olive oil 1. In a large casserole, combine all the ingredients except the egg, mushrooms, parsley and seasonings. Add enough water to cover everything and bring to a boil. Turn down the heat a little and let simmer for 1 to 2 hours or until chickpeas are soft while ocassionally stirring. Add some more water if needed; the dish should be more soupy than dry. 2. Stir in the olive oil so that the broth will emulsify and become creamier and let it boil again. Discard the bay leaf and the pimento peels. Season with some salt. 3. In the meantime, fry the mushrooms in a pan with hot olive oil and season with thyme, salt and pepper. Add to the pot, stir a bit and turn off the heat. Stir in the parsley and serve with the eggs.

After a nice dinner at Peter Luger and a few drinks in the lower east side, we went back to Harlem, drank some coffee and drove to da Bronx. It took a lot of effort to stay past 3am. We visited the Fulton Fish Market a couple of years ago, and when they decided to move the facility to Hunts Point, people didn't know if it was going to be a good thing or a bad thing. Seeing how much bigger the space was, I doubt any of the dealers complain now. The 400,000-square feet space along Food Center Drive cost about $86 million to create, but it's so vast, clean, well-lit and seemed like a much better space than what they had at Fulton Street. Plus, they're a few blocks away from the cooperative market which sells meat and other produce, so one can make a trip and buy everything he needs. It was like walking into a large freezer. The place was buzzing with the beeps from the forklifts and the hustle of the fishmongers and dealers. Most of them only sell wholesale, but one guy let us buy two yellow tail snappers for $11, which is definitely cheaper-and fresher-than anything I can buy in Chinatown for the same price. Besides, I rarely see whole yellow tail snappers in stores. Related post/s: Hunts Point Fish Market photos on Flickr

The clouds finally lifted after seven days of rain and mist. We all woke up to the sun shining through our windows. Just in time, too, because this is our last hurrah for the summer. It took a while for us to get ready because of last night's festivities in a few Fort Greene bars and a copious dinner at Blue Ribbon, but we were out the door by 1pm. The drive to Storm King was beautiful. It was as if the trees were greener than they usually were; as if they were celebrating the end of the torrential rains. It was cool enough to keep the car windows open and have Arctic Monkeys and Jurassic 5 blasting through the car radio. At Storm King, we parked our car and had a quick picnic with our Cuban sandwiches courtesy of El Partido in Washington Heights. We moved the car to the second parking lot afterwards and started our walk through the museum. The 500-acre open space in itself was a lot to take in. The oats, alfalfa and buckwheat plants are starting to take over the fields-part of the museum's efforts to reintroduce grasses and wildflowers after the land became susceptible to invasive plants. The sculptures made us feel insignificant. When you walk around them, you feel like there is nothing else to think about except for how tiny you are compare to everything else that concerns the rest of the world. It was tiny bit of a humility lesson, really. The Dr. had been there before. He showed me his favorites which became mine, too, especially the Richard Serra \"forks\" jutting out of the small hills. My brother and I had the urge to climb the sculptures, but alas, we didn't let our Filipino-ness embarrass him.

280 5th Avenue between 1st Street and Garfield Place, Park Slope, Brooklyn 718/840.0404 about $300 for three, with several drinks, without tip ♥ ♥ It's been years since I've been to Park Slope. The Dr. used to live there and it was back then when he took me to Blue Ribbon for dinner. My brother was in town and we happened to be driving around Brooklyn one rainy Saturday, so when dinner time came up, I suggested we go back to his old 'hood. Nothing's changed about the restaurant. It's still crowded and people still wait for their turn to be seated either at the bar or the dining room in the back. We were lucky that a table for three just opened up when we walked in. The menu hasn't changed either. Seasonal seafoods still dominate the menu-a pound of crayfish were ordered to start with a dozen oysters. Their bone marrow and oxtail marmalade is still one of our favorites. When you poke out the fat and eat it with the sweetness of the jelly preserve, you'll understand why. The steak tartare was just another plate of appreciated excess with the several glasses of sparkling and red wine we drank. The service is pretty attentive even though the place is so busy. A Blue Ribbon experience usually ends up not needing the attention of the service staff: you just eat and eat. Related post/s: Roasted bone marrow recipe

62 Prince Street corner of Lafayette 212/219.2129 about $15 for one, with a drink, without tip ♥ A really uncool name for such a great space and location, SoHo Park opened this week to all kinds of hungry and curious visitors. There were fashionable girls in line while the Brooks Brothers-wearing boys sat at the bar; even backpack-carrying guys joined gray-haired ladies in the dining area. I stopped by after work when they first opened and ordered a Hoegaarden and a Stella at the bar. The bartender had no clue how much beers were. I said, let's just make it $11, shall we? And he did. (They probably were about $5 apiece anyway.) After drinks, I wanted to see if I can sit on one of the camouflage-covered benches outside. I waited for the hostess to let me know how long the wait was but I could never get her attention. She needed help from other employees fast! I returned the next day for lunch and the line was long. There were plenty of seats inside but of course, the benches outside were already taken. After we ordered, we were given old license plates that had our order numbers written on them. Perhaps a nice touch to their \"park\" theme but the servers walked all over the restaurant in search of the correct numbers when delivering orders. (It was 1pm, by the way, but the girl at the counter was still compelled to greet each person in line a good morning.) The double Park burger was juicy but I didn't get cheese with it-I wasn't reminded by the girl at the counter that I could order it as an extra. The hand-cut Belgian fries were also pretty good. The grilled cheese with pesto smelled heavenly and tasted like it was indeed freshly-made. The onion rings were crunchy, greasy and was our best guilty pleasure side order. The different sauces were notable especially the red-pepper ketchup and the garlic aioli. (Redundant, I know, but they had different kinds of aioli.) The turkey portobello mushroom sandwich was a bit boring and dry but the focacia bread and the barely detectable sauce saved it. (I hope they correct the misspelling on their menu board before my next visit, though.) We also ordered the fried pickles which just turned out to be, well, hot. I think I like my Gus' pickles just the way they are. The food took a while to come because of the time of day, but when they did, we were pretty content (and hungry). The foot traffic will be good for business for sure, but they have to act quickly and focus on the service before they start turning people away.

Unsatisfied. This place charges for tap water. The day I was there , they were out of burgers. YES , a burger place- out of burgers... The staff seemed confused, and I would be also, if I didn't speak English. It was unerving to me to see the beverages left out on the counter. I spent a good time there the bevs. still recieved no refrigeration. I would reconmend soho park if you enjoy an upset stomach with a dose of mild food poisoning on a daily basis.

643 Hudson Street between Gansevoort and Horatio Streets 212/352.3590 about $70 for two, with three drinks, without tip ♥ ♥ Chef Zak Pelaccio is my kind of guy because he would fry pork belly until it's crispy and serve it with watermelon chunks and its rind, pickled. The result is a delicious balance of saltiness with juiciness and just the right amount of sourness. I can live with just this dish for a while. The rest of the menu is also good. During our first visit, we tried the quail egg shooters after I was alerted by a reader about an oyster-sake version. Four quail eggs are lightly poached and topped with sambal oelek, a traditional Indonesian spice; the other three come with a single anchovy and shredded dried pork floss. We also ordered the Jalan Alor chicken wings named after what used to be the Red Light District of Kuala Lumpur but where the best street food stalls are now located. It was a messy ordeal trying to eat them with our fork and spoon, and then later, with our hands. A very large serving of short rib Rendang came braised with kaffir lime, coconut and chili. It was absolutely delicious but I wished it wasn't $20-I would like it in a smaller portion for half the price. We sat at the bar at 7:30pm on a Monday night and just made it before people started lining up outside to get the next table. It's warm near the kitchen and with all the spicy food we were eating, we felt like we were actually in southeast Asia; Tiger and San Miguel beers flowed between my brother and I. An extra star for the spoon and fork setup, the oscillating fan on the ceiling, Chef de Cuisine Corwin Kave in baseball cap, and of course, the porn in the bathroom.

Simmering meats or fish for a long time is what Koreans call jjorim. Usually a soy sauce-based marinade is used to make jjorim stew. This is Nabi's mother's recipe but she's adapted it to make a vegetarian version with tofu. I copied and used both fish and tofu and it turned out to be the perfect bowl to nurse during a rainy day. I julienned a carrot and a radish while I roasted a small sweet potato. I put them all together in a pot with some firm tofu, poured over the soy sauce marinade and topped them with a beautiful cod fillet. The saltiness of the soy sauce evaporated when I put everything into a low simmer; I turned off the heat when the fish was white enough to look tender. Ingredients: 1 1-pound black cod fillet 1 package of firm tofu, diced 1 small daikon radish, julienned 1 medium carrot, julienned 1 small red onion, thinly sliced 1 small sweet potato, roasted, sliced 1/2 cup vegetable stock 5 tbsps soy sauce 2 tbsps white wine 1 tbsp maple syrup 2 tsps red chili flakes a small knob of ginger, peeled, thinly sliced 1 garlic, minced 1. Mix and stir all the liquid together with the maple syrup, ginger, garlic and pepper flakes to make marinade. 2. In a Dutch oven, layer all the vegetables and tofu. Pour the marinade into the pot. Add the vegetable stock. Top with the fish. 3. Cover and simmer for about 15 minutes. Top with roasted seaweed.

This didn't come out as pretty as I had hoped. I forgot to dip the set panna cotta gelée ramekins in warm water before unmolding for a smoother finish, but at least they came out deliciously purple. This was adapted from Gourmet Magazine. I took advantage of the fresh seedless grapes at Fairway and the leftover gelatin packets in my cupboard. I rarely make desserts but the last couple of summers, I've gotten the hang of making gelée and panna cotta. To test the waters, I only made two of these and excluded the grappa on both the gelée and the panna cotta-they still turned out yummy. Ingredients: For gelée: 1 tsp of unflavored gelatin 1/2 cup all-natural grape juice 1/2 tsp fresh lemon juice 1/2 cup seedless grapes, thinly sliced crosswise oil for greasing ramekins For panna cotta: 1 tsp unflavored gelatin 1/2 cup heavy cream 1/4 cup brown sugar 1 cup plain yogurt a pinch of salt 1. Make gelée. Sprinkle gelatin over half of the grape juice in a heavy saucepan and let stand for 1 minute to soften. Bring to a simmer and stir to dissolve gelatin. Remove from heat and stir in the remaining grape juice with the grapes and the lemon juice. Lightly oil the ramekins and put in a shallow baking pan. Divide grape mixture evenly among ramekins and chill in freezer for about 30 minutes or until gelée is set. 2. Make panna cotta while gelée sets. Stir in gelatin and half of the cream in another heavy saucepan and let stand for 1 minute to soften. Bring to a simmer and stir to dissolve the gelatin. Add the rest of the cream with sugar and return to a simmer until sugar is dissolved. Whisk together yogurt and salt in a bowl until smooth. Pour in cream mixture and whisk until combined well. 3. Pour mixture into ramekins over set gelée and chill, covered with Saran wrap, until firm, about 8 hours. 4. To unmold, run a thin sharp knife along the edge of the ramekin to loosen. Dip in a small bowl of very warm water for about 6 seconds. Invert a plate over each ramekin and then invert panna cotta gelée onto plates, gently lifting off ramekins.

Searching For a Good Taco: Red Hook, Brooklyn

I have to admit that we didn't drive from Harlem all the way down to Red Hook to look for a good taco. We made the trip to check out the Fairway Supermarket that opened a few months ago and do our grocery shopping for the week. Walking along the waterfront of Red Hook, you'll be reminded that the city was a port city. Giant machines, old warehouses, heavy containers, big ships, abandoned piers and the squawking seagulls make up the view. There is no subway close to the water so visitors need to have a car or trek from Carroll Gardens to get to Red Hook. It's probably this inconvenience that's stopping Manhattan folks from coming and moving in droves. But when you get there, you can imagine the old-school blue-collar New York way before the cafés and art galleries-and Fairway-started to open up in the neighborhood. Gentrification is well on its way, but who am I to snort when I live in one of the newest buildings in west Harlem? The Times featured the tents outside the Red Hook baseball fields last week where all kinds of different foods are sold. We wanted to pass by and look for the pupusas we had in El Salvador and to slurp the vinegar goodness of Ecuadorian ceviche. We thought that if we find a good taco, then it would just be icing on the cake. Little did we know that we'd actually find the best taco. My search this year ends. We parked our car and walked towards the park along Bay and Clinton Streets where we could already see blue tents set up for the forming lunch crowd. On Henry Street, however, we spotted a lone table with a tarp tied to a tree, so we decided to check the goods there before heading to the busier part of the field. Large pieces of pork are stewed in a vat of boiling marinade then cut up into smaller portions before filling soft tortillas with finely chopped onions and cilantro. I haven't tasted every taco sold in New York City but I'm going to have to lay it out there and say that this is the best taco I've had so far. As a comparison, we bought a beef steak taco from the last stand on the far side of Clinton. Although it was good, it wasn't enough to make us forget about the taco we just had. The Dr., my brother and I all voted for the first taco as the better one. The secret in the second taco was the chicharron, or pig's skin deep-fried into crunchy paradise. I think the lady was thrilled that we asked for extra chicharron when she was putting a taco together for us.

105 Reade Street between Church and Broadway 212/406.1900 about $55 for one, with two drinks, without tip ♥ For a $28 lunch prix fixe, my shellfish crepe with spinach was very satisfying. It included a scallop, small pieces of lobster and crab plus shrimps sandwiched in a soft crepe swimming in crab broth. I would have been happy without the crepe because it got soggy at the end, but that El Bulli-inspired foam is always interesting to look at. The gazpacho with shrimps had a nice spicy kick to it that I liked. They ran out of the octopus and squid salad and this cold soup was the right choice for a summer starter. I had room for dessert and I thought I made a good choice with the strawberry almond shortcake with sorbet. To me, something tart is always a good ending to a good meal. The busboy brought bread to the table three times while we waited for our food. Maybe the small flies buzzing around made him nervous because he was keen on spilling water whenever he would give us a refill. One of the flies-a really, really tiny one-dove into one of our wine glasses. To make up for it, the manager brought us an extra bottle of wine-a service totally unnecessary but very much appreciated by our entire group. Sometimes, attentive service makes up for everything else, even small insects. Sometimes. Related post/s: A roach in my meal at Blue Hill Restaurant

6 Bond Street between Broadway and Lafayette 212/777.2500 $155 for two, with four drinks, with tip ♥ ♥ Several years ago, you would have caught a glimpse of Leonardo DiCaprio dining at Bond St. Today, the bouncer in all-black suit is still standing outside and all the beautiful people are still inside, but instead of Leo's posse, you'll see the suits and the loud groups of bankers eating on, most likely, company money. Ah, the life. We went one Wednesday night at 8:30pm without reservations. As soon as we asked for a spot for two, they led us to the sushi counter! Ah, the life of those without expense accounts! It gets loud in Bond St but the energy is intoxicating. The sushi chefs scream a greeting when diners walk in and a goodbye when someone leaves. We opted for the sushi and sashimi omakase with a bonito-crusted scallop appetizer to start. From what I can remember, we had the pike eel, the otoro, the shrimp topped with caviar and the uni. While nothing is sublime that made me swoon and roll my eyes back, the fish is still sushi-grade. They still melt like butter and they still taste insanely fresh. Several years ago, Leonardo DiCaprio switched to Moomba after he got tired of Bond St. For normal people like me, Bond St is still a pretty good Japanese place.

120 West 116th Street between Lenox and 7th Avenue 212/864.4700 $25 for two, without drinks, without tip ♥ Named after the \"upside-down tree\" native to Madagascar, this Senagalese restaurant is one of the many African restaurants in Harlem serving whole fried fish for less than $12. We ordered one with a bowl of lamb curry and Senegalese couscous. The lamb curry had a nutty taste to it instead of the coconut milk I'm used to and it was made better by the white rice that came with the fish. The couscous had such an overwhelming texture I couldn't really eat it with a thick sauce so I ate it with the fried fish and the hot salsa they gave us. We walked in looking forward to eating a simple dinner but we came out with a whole new view of Harlem. A stream of people-women wearing exquisite fabrics, brilliant swatches of cloth knotted in bandanas and men in lose tunics-stopped by to talk, laugh and argue with the other patrons while we ate. We felt like we were in someone's house in Africa but no one treated us as if we didn't belong in there.

91 First Avenue between 5th and 6th Streets 212/614.9333 $60 for two, BYOB, without tip ♥ Because it's the only Sri Lankan restaurant in Manhattan, Sigiri is a gem. It's on the same block as the East 6th Indian restaurants, so if you blink-or if the red lights make you squint-you might just miss it. But try not to miss the dhal vade or lentil patties, the fish and potato cutlets and the vegetable and fish spring rolls, all breaded and deep-fried with traditional Sri Lankan spices. You can get each as an appetizer portion for about $5 or get the sampler for $8.50. The beef curry was a bit boring because the meat was dry inside, but the coconut milk curry covered its blandness and made the dish edible. We loved the yellow basmati rice cooked in saffron with cashew nuts and golden raisins. It was so hearty I could have eaten it without anything else. The best thing about Sigiri, though, is their BYOB policy. Dowel Quality Products, the deli downstairs, sells every beer imaginable.

I had leftover lamb ribs in the freezer that I wanted to use before my run in the park. When I returned out of breath, the last thing I wanted to do after my shower was to go to the grocery store. I searched the Food Network and found this Ming Tsai recipe using lamb shoulder. The list of ingredients, except for the chickpeas, were all in my cupboard so I used a can of butter beans instead. It also gave me a chance to use the fresh honey I bought at a farm when we were in Long Island. September is only a couple of weeks away and the dish made me look forward to autumn. I love braising cheap cuts of meat because it only requires using one pot where I can put everything together and leave it for several hours without worrying about overcooking. My favorite part is pouring the leftover sauce on top of the dish before serving. The liquid is thick and the flavors become concentrated. For this dish, the honey just gave the sauce a subtle hint of sweetness. Ingredients: 6 pieces lamb ribs 2 sprigs of rosemary 1 cup all-purpose flour 1 tbsp chili powder 1 tbsp ground cumin 3 cloves of garlic, smashed 1 tbsp ginger, smashed 1 small red onion, finely chopped 1 carrot, diced 4 ribs of celery, chopped 2 bay leaves 1 cup red wine 1 can of butter beans, drained and rinsed 1 cup of honey 2 tbsps soy sauce salt, pepper, Canola oil 1. Mix together the flour, chili powder and cumin in a platter and use to rub and cover the lamb. In a Dutch oven and working in batches to avoid overcrowding, heat some oil and brown the lamb on both sides, about 12 minutes per side. Remove the lamb and set aside on a plate. 2. Wipe the Dutch oven clean with a paper towel and place back on high heat. Coat again with oil and sauté the garlic, ginger, onions, carrots and celery. Season with salt and pepper. Add rosemary and bay leaves and deglaze with red wine. 3. Add the butter beans, honey and soy sauce. Add back the lamb and some water to cover. Check for flavor of the braising liquid and season with salt and pepper to taste. Bring to a boil and reduce heat to simmer for about 1 to 2 hours, or until fork tender.

Miss Geolouxy volunteered her services to accompany me for my second search for a good taco. It was after work so we decided to meet at Astor Place and work our way up and down First and Second Avenues from 1st to 10th Streets. I didn't bring a list of places since the east side is not my territory, but I had a map to keep us from making a wrong turn towards the no-number streets. (That's for another day.) The area around St. Marks Place has always been the place to get a bowl of soba noodles early in the day, a sterling silver stud for your ear at lunch, a tattoo in the afternoon, a pair of socks from the Sock Man afterwards and a chicken gizzard yakitori with a bottle of Sapporo for dinner, all in one day. While you can still get all those today, you'd have to fight your way to get through the crowds stopping by chickpea, the falafel place in the corner, Chipotle, Grand Sichuan and soon enough Bamn!, a shop full of vending machines off Second Avenue. The neighborhood has indeed changed. We learned early that it would be hard to keep our budget of $3 for each taco. The downtown locations come with an extra price hike. Unlike the tacos uptown, the second tortilla is wrapped around the first so that they look like burritos, perhaps it's because people are on the go downtown. I also found it interesting that none of our tacos came in half-moon shapes. San Loco Mexico, 124 Second Avenue off St. Marks Place, 212/260.7948 The guys at the bar wouldn't get up from watching their baseball game to let two ladies sit and eat, but at least the catfish taco was good enough to make us stay. The fish is breaded and deep-fried and it was crispy and hot enough to make everything all right. The shredded pork was equally tasty and succulent. The two tacos cost us a little less than $7. Puebla Mexican Food and Coffee, 47 First Avenue between 2nd and 3rd Streets, 212/473.6643 The chorizo taco was just all about salty goodness here. We loved the cilantro and the lime juice, plus the tortilla had a different texture than what I was used to. My favorite out of the four even at $5.25. Downtown Bakery, 69 First Avenue between 4th and 5th Streets, 212/254.1757 The guava jelly roll is a plus but we weren't there to rate their pastries so we stuck with the chorizo taco that came with avocado. Instead of ground pork, this was sausage cut up in smaller pieces. The tortilla seemed to taste more real here, too. They serve two tacos for $6 but they were nice enough to sell us only one to share. Paquito's, 143 First Avenue between St. Marks Place and 9th Street, 212/674.2071 We ordered the beef taco this time for $2.50. It was a little bit chewy but the good salsa that came with it was pretty tasty. Their \"Real Mexican Style\" taco was more substantial than the others. Their red blinking sign gave me a headache while we waited for our order, so if I have to return, I'd check out their restaurant next door. We only had a couple of hours-we opted for a manicure first, of course-so we ended up only hitting four spots but what good spots they were!

You need to cross the Hudson to JC and head over to Downtown Taqueria for some good, authentic tacos. This place only serves real Mexican food (no burritos, no taco salads), and my Mexican neighbors & their friends from NY & NJ swear it's the best Mexican they've had north of the border. Let me know when you want to come to my 'hood and we'll gladly take you there!

When corns are in season in the summer, people immediately grill or steam them. I usually make this corn soup, a staple when I was growing up in Manila. To me, slurping soup is one of the most comforting things you can do for yourself even if it's 90 degrees outside. Even if you don't have all the vegetables to make a nice stock, the natural sweetness of the corn is enough to make the broth tasty. Kale or even broccoli is a good substitute for the bok choy. Ingredients: 5 ears of fresh corn, kernels sliced off using a serrated knife 2 bunches of baby bok choy 1 medium red onion 2 garlic cloves, minced 1/2 pound of ground pork red pepper flakes salt, pepper, oil 1. In a stock pot, heat some oil and sauté garlic until brown and onions until transparent. Add the ground pork and brown until cooked. 2. Add the greens and cook until slightly wilted. Add 8 cups of water and the corn and bring to a boil. Season with salt and pepper. 3. Ladle in soup bowls and sprinkle with red pepper flakes before serving.

305 Church Street corner of Walker 212/925.1205 $25 for two, with two drinks, without tip ♥ ♥ Update, 2008: Province has closed Oh, mantou, where have you been all these years? Mantou, the steamed bun mainstay of northern Chinese street food stalls is finally in TriBeCa. And I hope it stays because the neighborhood could use a practical place to eat where good food is served without the frills and the bill. A mantou sandwich is $3.75 and you can choose between bulgogi with kimchi, spicy pork, grilled chicken or braised pork shoulder with pickled radish. Each mantou is freshly-baked and grilled so the sesame seeds on top get toasted for a nice smoky taste. They're dense but spongy; doughy but not heavy. If two mantous are not enough for you, the bowl of cold sesame noodles with tofu, eggs, carrots and cucumber in soy-ginger sauce is substantial for less than $7. It's a refreshing summer lunch. Province calls itself the Chinese Canteen and frankly, I like that name better. I would even call it the Asian Canteen because you can practically sandwich anything with mantou. Its simple unfinished decor reminds me of Momofuku Noodle Bar, only less pretentious and less crowded. Related post/s: Momofuku Noodle Bar

Adapted from The North Fork Table & Inn, Long Island, using wild striped bass Ingredients: 1 1/2 pound of cod fillet, slice into 3 steaks 3 stalks of celery, chopped a small fennel bulb, chopped 1/2 cup of piquillo olives, pitted, finely chopped red wine vinegar olive oil 1. In a skillet, let the celery and fennel sweat in low heat. Remove from heat when celery is tender enough. Transfer to a small bowl. 2. In a separate bowl, combine vinegar and the olive oil. Add the olives and whisk until desired consistency. Dress the vegetables and let it stand. 3. Prepare the fish. Preheat oven to 350º. In the meantime, heat some olive oil in a frying pan and sear the cod until a nice brown crust has formed on one side and it moves easily away from the pan when gently pushed with a spatula. Turn and brown the other side. Transfer the fish in the pan to the oven and bake for no longer than 7 minutes, just enough to cook the inside. Serve fish on top of the vegetables and top with leftover olives.

In Chinatown, I saw these cool-looking fruits they call dragon fruit. One sign had \"gradon\" written on a piece of cardboard. Those Chinese vendors get confused sometimes! I couldn't get any information from them so I did my own research after buying one for $3. They're native to Central and South America, but they're apparently now the number one export of Vietnam. The meat is like a kiwi's. It's white and fleshy with a lot of small black seeds. It tastes a little bit like kiwi but without the tartness. I tried a little bit with salt and another piece with sugar just to see the difference. With sugar, it became somewhat bitter, but salt didn't really make a big difference. If it wasn't too early for rum, I could imagine putting this in a blender and making a cocktail out of it. Perhaps next time. There's also rambutan out on the streets now. I grew up eating these in the Philippines, so I was taken aback when half a pound, about 6 pieces, cost $3.75. They taste like lychee, only the red leathery skin is surrounded by soft spikes or hair. In Malay, rambut means hair. If it's the right time, the flesh is sweet and juicy and it comes off the seed easily when you eat it, avoiding the bitter soft bark that covers that seed. Since we're speaking of cocktails, it's great to have one at the bottom of a martini glass-sans the spiny skin, of course.

I could imagine Anna when she was a kid picking and sucking out the meat from these steamed crabs until her fingers turned wrinkly and raisin-like. She told me that most Cantonese grew up with the salty egg and meat patty combination but her father made it extra special by mixing it with steamed blue crabs. This was one of my best homecooked meals this summer. Be careful of the live crabs. One of them pinched me and it hurt! If you have some extra time before cooking, put them in the freezer for about 20 minutes so they \"fall asleep.\" Cracking them open later would not feel so bad. The best part of this recipe is pouring that super hot oil over the blue crabs before serving. Again, be very careful because the oil will be very hot, but oh, that crackling sound! Ingredients: half a dozen blue crabs 2 cooked salted duck eggs, shelled 1 regular egg 1/4 pound of ground pork cilantro, roughly chopped scallions, chopped 3 cloves of garlic, crushed oil 1. Open the blue crabs by pulling off the shell from the body. Remove apron and gills. Cut the crabs in half and using a pincher, smash the claws for easy access to the meat later. 2. In a bowl, combine the salted egg and regular egg and mix in the ground meat. Using your hands, mash the meat in the egg mixture then pour over the blue crabs. Sprinkle with cilantro and scallions, saving some for later. 3. Using a large Dutch oven, steam the crabs for about 15 minutes or until the crab shells are deep orange. 4. In a separate wok, heat the oil and add the garlic. Without waiting for the garlic to burn, quickly but gently pour the hot oil over the plate of steamed blue crabs. Garnish with the rest of the cilantro and scallions.

I liked the idea of the bacalao carpaccio but without the black olive emulsion, it would have been bland. In Portugal, fresh codfish is rarely eaten. Dried salted codfish, or what we know as the more expensive clipfish, is the way to go for South Americans. Octopus with white beans Black olive emulsion on bacalao Our young server was attentive and even though In Tent was busy at 9pm on a Wednesday night, we were promptly accommodated without reservations after a drink at the bar. I'll come back for more of that lamb.

9 St. Marks Place between 2nd and 3rd Avenues212/228.5086about $50 for two, with two drinks, with tip Yakitori Taisho is one of those Japanese places on St. Marks that you end up going to after drinking all night because they're open until after midnight. Oh! Taisho is that new space they've needed because the original is always packed. Too much bacon can kill you Yakitori is traditionally grilled chicken but nowadays, the term is used to refer to anything barbequed. The secret is the sauce that comes with every skewer made up of rice wine vinegar, sweet sake, soy sauce and sugar. My favorite is getting one of each of the yakitoris with bacon for about $2 each: with quail egg, asparagus, okra and scallops. I also love the beef stomach and the tongue. Two other good dishes I find hard to skip are the kimchi yakiudon and the pork spareribs. The pork falls off the bone and is perfectly tender. The kimchi yakiudon is spicy enough to make you pause in between bites. I usually order it when I'm not in the mood for a bowl of rice. Good barbeque Kimchi Yakiudon Salary men in Japan are known to eat yakitori after a long day at work with their favorite sake. Here in New York City though, I stick with my Asahi Dry.

Searching For a Good Taco: Upper West Side

***CONTENT
For my first search for a good taco, I decided to stay on Amsterdam Avenue and the upper west side, specifically from 100th to 145th Streets. I started on 100th mainly because I wanted to hit a favorite spot on 108th but also because I wanted to end up at Jesus' Tacos near my apartment, a small store that shares space with Twin Donut. Every time I pass by, I chuckle at the name and I knew that someday, I'm going to have to buy something from there. (Of course, it's more likely pronounced as Heh-sus than Gee-sus but that's not as funny.) I was alone and I immediately found out that two tacos were my limit, maybe three if I pick on the filling and skip the tortilla, so I kept it down to ordering chorizo or ground pork tacos. At the stores where they didn't carry the pork kind, I either bought beef, goat or chicken. I also didn't spend more than $2.50 on each taco, the cheapest being two dollars. As for selecting which ones to go to, I looked around as I made my way up Amsterdam Avenue and went in to every store, restaurant and bodega that had an awning painted with the Mexican flag colors and had, well, \"tacos\" or \"Mexican food\" plastered on the windows. Banderitas, loud Spanish music or television and a picture of the Lady of Guadalupe were all big pluses. Noche, 852 Amsterdam Avenue between 101st and 102nd Streets, 212/662.6900 Italian Mexican, 886 Amsterdam Avenue between 102nd and 103rd Streets, 212/316.1427 Los Paisas, 890 Amsterdam Avenue between 103rd and 104th Streets, 212/961.1263 Taqueria y Fonda, 968 Amsterdam Avenue between 107th and 108th Streets, 212/531.0383 Yuca Mexican Products, 1345-49 Amsterdam Avenue corner of 125th Street Cielito Lindo, 1354 Amsterdam Avenue between 125th and 126th Streets, 212/222.0938 Mex Juquila, 1486 Amsterdam Avenue between 133rd and 134th Streets, 212/694.7142 Jesus' Taco, 501 West 145th Street on Amsterdam Avenue, 212/234.3330 The verdict: chorizo tacos are indistinguishable; ground pork is ground pork. What makes a difference is how the chorizo is cooked and how the taco is prepared. My favorite was the chorizo taco from Taqueria y Fonda between 107th and 108th Streets because the bits and pieces of pork were grilled, crunchy and toasted. Even the onions were grilled so they added some sweetness to the flavor. Their salsa also came with small pieces of avocado and finding each one was a nice surprise. The chorizo from Cielito Lindo between 125th and 126th Streets came in a close second. They actually cut a sausage into smaller pieces; crunchy chorizo skin is always a plus. As for the non-chorizo tacos, the goat from Yuca was great and the huge peppers were a nice touch. The chicken from Mex Juquila was pretty much like how white meat tastes: boring and unexciting. Between the two beef tacos I got, I liked the one from Noche better than the ungodly experience at Jesus'. Related post/s: The story behind Searching for a Good Taco in New York City

don't know if you still read this, but i can't believe a houstonian referred you to Pappasitos. Pappasitos is trendy tex mex, you don't go there for the good stuff. I only began to like it after i moved here because it is much better than any tex mex here, but when i lived in houston, it was awful compared to other places.

After several errands on Saturday morning, we finally made it to the car and started our drive towards the George Washington Bridge. Before reaching Harriman State Park, we saw a sign for the oldest lighthouse along the Hudson River and decided to make a detour. The Stony Point lighthouse was built in 1826 to warn ships coming in due to increased river traffic after the opening of Erie Canal. Stony Point lighthouse, the oldest along the Hudson River For $5, we entered the Stony Point Battlefield State Historic Site and walked around the grounds where the Americans beat the British during a midnight surprise assault. The view of the Haverstraw Bay was beautiful. The boats on Haverstraw Bay We then proceeded to the second largest state park in New York. We read that there are over 200 miles of hiking trails but we couldn't find trail marks except for a gate towards the smaller Bear Mountain State Park. We walked along the concrete road until we reached an electric tower and found yellow trail marks on the surrounding trees. We followed those up to the fire tower which we climbed to get a glimpse of the man-made Lake Welch Beach down the hill. It reminded us of the old radio tower we climbed in Sagada. That was the first time I found out the Dr. has some fear of heights. I was ahead of him ascending this tower, too, and he stopped right below me because his \"balls were tingling.\" I had to stop laughing to keep the the tower still. He stayed where he was and we enjoyed the view from up above separately. The Dr. stopped here Man-made Lake Welch Beach dotted with people The electric tower from the fire tower Green, green, green! Through the forest, we skipped over huge rocks and climbed small hills and made our way up to a stone house. We sat there for a while to catch our breaths and enjoy the view of the river. It was the perfect day for a hike because it was breezy and it wasn't too humid. Stone house on top It took another hour to make it back to our car where we ate a Oaxaqueñan sandwich we bought in the morning. We felt that we didn't really do anything strenuous but that we got enough exercise because of the ups and downs. George Washington Bridge before sunset Still, though, we rewarded ourselves by driving to Flushing and eating Malaysian fare at Sentosa.

39-07 Prince Street, Flushing, Queens718/886.6331$45 for three, with two drinks, without tip A stopover in Flushing after picking up my father from the airport proved to be worth the trip for less than $45. We're big fans of the roti canai. I suppose roti canais are all the same but we really liked Sentosa's version of the curry chicken and potato dipping sauce. Roti Canai Satay bores me because they always serve them as an hor d'oeuvre in parties and weddings. Sentosa's was \"grilled to perfection\"-dry and flaky-and the sauce needed to taste more like peanuts. Beef Satay One of my favorites was the lobak with deep fried ground meat and the shrimp pancakes even though the fried tofu was unexciting. I loved the chili sauce better than the Hoisin. Lobak I liked the nasi lemak, a plate of anchovies, curry chicken and a hard-boiled egg with coconut rice. Nasi Lemak The beef rendang tasted like any other beef rendang I've tasted. But their seafood tom yum soup was delicious. I love the sourness of the lemongrass together with the spice of the seafood broth.

1969 Amsterdam Avenue corner of 158th Street212/283.7752about $20 for two, without drinks, without tip We always point to this restaurant when we would drive by from the west side highway. One lazy Saturday, we finally stopped by for an early lunch. It's like a fiesta inside One of our favorite places in the world is Oaxaca in Mexico so just the name of this place intrigued us. Unfortunately, it wasn't the time of the day to eat mole-for us, at least-the Oaxaqueñan blend of chocolate and chiles sauce, so we tried their tacos and ordered one of their sandwiches to go instead. The goat taco, which they called the barbacoa so I assume it was slow-cooked, was nothing special; it was actually quite bland. The chorizo and the beef taco were pretty good but not spectacular. Tacos! Later in the day, we unwrapped the Oaxaqueñan sandwich made of roast beef and ham. We wondered if the beans gave it its name because otherwise, it was just a messy Cuban sandwich. Do beans make a sandwich Oaxaqueñan? I don't have to do a return trip to La Oaxaqueña but I'm glad we tried it.

110 Waverly Place between MacDougal and Sixth 212/777.0303 about $900 for six, with a lot of drinks, with tip ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ For my annual pilgrimage, I was diligent and booked a table exactly thirty days from our dinner date to get a prime spot at 9pm for six people. It was to celebrate Cameron's and Peter's birthdays. I'd like to think that for friends, I'm extra thoughtful. There is no need to explain why I'm giving Babbo yet another four. I'll let these photos do their job: There was also the marinated fresh sardines with caramelized fennel and lobster oil, the epic grilled octopus with \"Borlotti Marinati\" and spicy limoncello vinaigrette and the spaghettini with spicy budding chives, sweet garlic and a one-pound lobster, the unforgettable lamb's brains, plus three other desserts and three bottles of a rosé champagne and red wine. After four hours, we were way above our heads to even recall every detail. It was a very good night. I love me some Mario Batali. Related post/s: I was younger back then but I already knew good food

2110 Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard off 126th Street 212/280.7437 $110 for two, with two drinks, without tip no stars Updated, 2007: Pier 2110 was short-lived I've been living more than twelve years uptown, three of those in Harlem. When I go to a restaurant in the neighborhood, I've come to expect that there'd be little to no ambiance and the food will be very simple but down-to-earth. So when a new restaurant bills itself as \"Harlem's Newest Jewel\", I believe it but I expect more. The Korean-owned Pier 2110 tries hard to be that jewel, but so hard everything comes out garish and overpowering. I know they mean well, serving seafood dishes the locals are already accustomed to and revitalizing the neighborhood, but for a $21 plate of pork chops, I don't want steamed broccoli with it smothered with plum sauce and then call it \"plum-glaze.\" My catfish was equally intriguing on their menu: pan-roasted with sweet potato purée, broccoli florets, fig and rosemary compote and bourbon cider sauce. But for $19, I didn't expect an overcooked limp fillet with a soup of mashed potato. They've been up and running for almost a month now but the service still needs a lot of sharpening. The maitre d' didn't have our names in the computer even though I secured reservations a day before. (No shorts and sneakers allowed, by the way!) A busboy interrupted our waiter and his announcement of the specials to let us know that the rolls were still in the oven. We waited for a few minutes to get our waiter's attention to ask for a knife to eat our pork chops with-he picked up the knife from the table setting next to us. (He came back with a steak knife after we rejected that.) In between courses, he brought out the bottle of Purell-I am not kidding-so we could squirt and sanitize our hands. He offered us tea before the dessert menu which I thought might be a good way to end our lackluster evening. To our surprise, he came out with a beautiful jeweled box full of...Celestial Seasonings tea bags. The restaurant's decor is ocean-themed, but their idea of high-end reminds me of the Red Lobster in Times Square. There are cascading water on glass walls and small fountains, stained glass artwork and aquariums everywhere. There is a \"sushi\" station offering all kinds of California rolls in the middle of the room, perhaps the same space where Billie Holiday used to perform during the Vaudeville Era. (In fact, the building used to be the Alhambra Theater in 1905.) The staff was very attentive, but Pier 2110 has to offer the kind of service-and food-that's worth $110 for two people.

On my way to Jones Beach for the first time this season, the Dr. texted and told me that he will be out by noon. He wanted to tag along. This was a big deal to me considering I was there almost every Saturday last summer. So I packed lunch for two-angel-hair pasta, roasted chicken from the Spanish store down the block and some watermelon slices with a big bottle of water-and met up with him at Penn Station. By 2pm, we were on the beach. We situated ourselves on my usual spot. It's less crowded because it's in between the couples with children and the happy gays, two groups who don't want to be near each other. We rented a big umbrella and ate our lunch. I spent the rest of the afternoon sunbathing and reading clips from The Times while the Dr., well, slept and slept. Four hours later, we got stuck on the road because of a car accident along the way. The ten-minute shuttle bus ride to the train station took more than an hour. We caught the 8pm train back to New York City and had dinner at Grand Sichuan before we trudged back to Harlem. Our sunny Sunday went as quick as the Boston Kreme doughnut the Dr. bought for me while in Long Island.

Unfortunately, it doesn't include Sichuan, the spicy kind. When I crave the flavor of numbing Sichuan peppers, I go to Grand Sichuan International in Chelsea. They have a few branches in the city, but I frequent the one in Chelsea. No matter what time you visit, it's always crowded. The service is inconsistent, but their kung pao chicken is always right and the dan dan noodles always spicy. It ain't Monterey Park outside of Los Angeles, but it will have to do.

139 North 6th Street between Bedford Avenue and Berry, Williamsburg, Brooklyn718/302.4441about $50 for two, without drinks, without tip Brought to my attention by that stand-off with Bobby Flay, the Hurricane Hopeful Surf Bar claims to have the best clam chowder in New York City. It was ninety degrees but that didn't stop us from tasting and judging them for ourselves. We ordered the crab and corn chowder and the popular haddock chowder for about $6 each. Corn and crab chow-dah Now, I don't really know anything about chowder. I've had several during multiple visits to Maine and Boston and I've tasted them watery like broth and thick like bisque-I just don't know what proper chowder is like. At Hurricane Hopeful Surf Bar, my ignorance didn't matter because they are all really good. The consistency is in the middle and I liked them that way. But skip the other items on the menu when you go. The conch fritters were mostly made of batter. The red snapper ceviche was very watery and tasted of sweet orange juice. Soupy ceviche The space looks miniscule from outside but it extends all the way at the back to an outdoor garden decorated with small paper lanterns. The sand on the floor takes you as far away as, well, some beach in the Northeast but the service is exceptional. For a busy Saturday night, our waiter treated us like real ladies, making sure we were okay with everything during that one balmy summer night.

Meanwhile, cook buckwheat noodles in boiling water until tender, about 12 minutes. Rinse with cold water several times, gently squeezing the noodles each time to make them chewy. Drain. 4. Soak the radish with the rest of the rice vinegar, sugar and salt. Let stand for a few minutes then drain. Toss and sprinkle red pepper powder and drizzle with sesame oil. 5. When ready to serve, place about a handful of noodles in a soup bowl. Top noodles with meat slices, radish, cucumber, pears and egg. Ladle cold broth. Serve with kimchi and roasted seaweed.

Summer 2006 Getaway Part 1: Bedford, New York

Let me sleep until 10am and I will drive you wherever you want, was the only request from the Dr. on Saturday night. To honor this, I quietly got out of bed at 8:30am on Sunday, cooked the leftover paneer cheese in the fridge from the Newar chataamari recipe last Friday and concocted an egg breakfast with it and bacon. I made iced coffee to complete. At exactly 10am, I returned to the bedroom, jumped on the bed and woke the Dr. up like it was Christmas morning. Scrambled egg with crumbled paneer We've talked about using his car this summer for quick getaways until he has to ship it back to Los Angeles but we haven't been able to plan a weekend together. I've been wanting to hike somewhere close by now that Vermont is no longer at the tips of our fingers so I've been gathering some driving directions for him to look over during his free time. (I'm the planner, he's the driver!) He graciously woke up after I made a racket, shot down my idea of a 2-hour drive to Saugerties but agreed to the half-hour drive to Bedford, right along the Connecticut border. After finally realizing where he parked his car-the Dr. usually has spurts of memory loss when disturbed from a deep sleep by a Filipina girl-we started the drive to the Mianus River Gorge Wildlife and Botanical Reserve. The day started out cloudy but after noon, the sun started to peek in through the tall trees. It was an absolutely gorgeous day for a walk in the forest. Off the trail was the Havermeyer Falls The Mianus (plenty of Jackass jokes, I know) River Gorge Preserve was the first Nature Conservancy Project back in 1953. Hemlock, beech and oak grow in the highland areas and mushrooms multiply abundantly. The ground was soft and the moss was all shades of green. We walked about three miles to the top where we were rewarded with clean, fresh air and this view of the gorge: We continued down half a mile and reached the end of the trail. The water seemed pretty high because of the recent rain but nevertheless, it was a peaceful sight. A total of five miles later, we were back in the parking lot. It wasn't the green mountains of Vermont but upstate New York served us well. Formed by the rushing waters of the Wisconsin glacier about 15,000 years ago Back in the city, we decided to eat a late lunch in the Bronx since we already had the car out. Unfortunately, the market on Arthur Avenue was closed so we ended up eating tacos from a Mexican dive on Crescent Avenue. They were delicious with our Negra Modelos even though the waitress, the owner and the cook were all standing in front of us while we ate at the bar. (They were curious as to what brought two Asian people in their restaurant.) When we finally made it back to Harlem, we decided to stop by the Fairway on 12th Avenue to stock our fridge with fresh summer produce. I can't believe I've never been there before! Like the other Fairway in the upper west side, the aisles are tight and claustrophobic but the main reason to go is the meat and seafood freezer room where you have the option to wear a jacket to protect yourself from the cold. You push your cart along the rows and rows of nicely cut meat. I had brain freeze just deciding which cut of veal to buy. Unfortunately, the seafood counter is small and they didn't carry live crabs but every other cut of a cow and a pig were in there. All kinds of steak; take a pick! Cheese? How about some cheese? The summer produce was equally nice. None of the fresh herbs soaked in a pail of water. No showers to make the fruits look shiny. Just in-season fruits and vegetables. I found some beautiful golden beets and haricots verts and remembered a Gourmet magazine terrine recipe back at the apartment. The Dr. grabbed a bag full of arugula, nectarines and pears and helped me select a shoulder of veal for five dollars. Dinner later that night was delicious. I used this recipe and replaced the frisee with the arugula and substituted the walnuts with crushed hazelnuts. The veal took about eight minutes per side right under the broiler. A bottle of white wine was the perfect match. Arugula with pear and mustard-sherry vinegar dressing Veal shoulder tastes like offal because of all the blood running through that part All of a sudden, waking up before 11am during his rare day off from the hospital was worth it. I can't wait to make another racket next weekend.

Adapted from Gourmet Magazine Ingredients: a handful of haricots verts, trimmed 4 golden beets, trimmed with1/2-inch of stems intact, cleaned off dirt fresh chives, cut in shorter pieces 2 small envelopes of gelatin 2 medium carrots, cut in small pieces 3 stalks of scallions, finely chopped 2 shallots, finely chopped 1 sprig of rosemary 2 sprigs of thyme 1 cup dry white wine whole peppercorns oil, salt and pepper 1. Roast beets. Preheat oven to 450º. Wrap beets in heavy-duty foil and put in a shallow baking pan. Roast for about 1 hour and a half. Let steam in foil for an extra 10 minutes outside the oven. When cool enough to handle, gently squeeze to peel off skin. Cut into wedges and season with salt and pepper. Set aside. 2. Make the gelatin mixture. Bring 3 cups of water to a boil with white wine, shallots, scallions, peppercorns and salt over medium-high heat. Reduce heat and simmer uncovered for 30 minutes. Add rosemary, thyme and half of the chives and simmer for 10 minutes. Pour stock through a fine mesh and discard solids. Save 2 1/2 cups of the stock. 3. Make the gelatin. In 1/4 cup of water, stir in gelatin powder and let stand for a minute to soften. Add to the gelatin mixture and stir until dissolved. Set aside. 4. Prepare haricots verts while roasting beets. Boil in salted water for about 7 minutes. Blanche in ice water to stop cooking. Drain and pat dry. Season with salt and pepper. Set aside. 5. Assemble terrine. Lightly oil a nonreactive terrine or loaf pan. Line the bottom and sides with Saran wrap while smoothing out the wrinkles and leaving overhang around the pan. Pour about 1 cup of the gelatin mixture and quick-chill in freezer for about 20 minutes. When the first layer of gelatin is set, lay some of the haricots verts over, sprinkle with some chives and top with some of the beets. Repeat layering until all vegetables are used leaving some space between them for the gelatin to fill and hold them together. Stir the remaining gelatin mixture again and pour over vegetables except for 1/2 cup. Make sure all the vegetables are covered with the gelatin mixture. Chill in the refrigerator, uncovered, until the top is set, about 2 hours. Stir the remaining gelatin mixture and pour over set terrine. Put the terrine back in the refrigerator and chill until firm. 6. When ready to serve, run a thin knife along the sides of the terrine. Invert on a plate and gently pull off Saran wrap to help unmold. Carefully slice and transfer on a plate using a spatula. Drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper.

Whenever I buy a whole fish, I ask the fish monger to have it cleaned but I also ask to keep the fish head and the bones. If I'm lucky, Blue Moon Fish from Mattituck, Long Island at the Union Square farmers' market gives them away for free. My dad especially likes using them for Filipino paksiw, which is a fish soup made less fishy by adding a lot of ginger. For a non-Filipino recipe, I use my own fish stock to make an accompanying sauce for the fish itself. Fish fumet is the French version of a concentrated fish stock. Because it's such a classic, I turned to my Larousse Gastronomique to find a solid recipe. fish heads and bones, rinsed well 4 stalks of celery, chopped 1 leek, thoroughly washed, chopped 1 large red onion, chopped 2 bay leaves salt, pepper 1. Put all the ingredients in a pot with enough cold water to cover. Bring to a boil, then immediately lower the fire. Skim impurities carefully and let the stock simmer, without boiling, for about two hours. 2. When the stock has reduced to about 75%, strain to a container. Let cool before storing in the fridge.

Nepal: Stuffed Chataamari

***CONTENT
Ubin gave me a lecture about the Newar people of Nepal when he gave me this recipe. They are the indigenous people of Kathmandu and the largest ethnic group according to the 2001 Nepalese census. He grew up eating chataamaris-what he would translate as rice crepes-and drinking San Miguel beer to match. He claims that Newari food is the best cuisine in Nepal but grounding the rice and lentils was laborious. I can imagine that a powerful mixer or blender would have been beneficial to use instead of my old-school mortar and pestle. Dal is what the Nepalese use to refer to lentils, split and skinned. But they also use the term for all peas and beans that go through the process. Split lentils don't hold their shape well, so they're usually used for purées. I bought a package of black beluga lentils from Whole Foods. Even though the instructions said I didn't need to soak them, I did anyway to follow the recipe. I also found a block of paneer cheese at Whole Foods. I also found it easier to make the chataamaris separately and serve the stuffing on the side instead of making them empanada style like the recipe originally suggested. We ended up tearing the chataamari and eating it like bread, scooping and soaking up the chicken while we ate. Ingredients: 2 cups long-grain rice 1 cup black dal or lentils 1 tbsp cumin seeds, toasted, crushed 4 pieces of boneless chicken thighs, cut into small pieces 1 cup paneer cheese, crumbled 3 stalks of scallions, finely chopped 2 cloves of garlic, minced 1 small knob of ginger, peeled and crushed 2 fresh chilis, finely chopped 1 tomato, finely chopped clarified butter oil, salt, pepper 1. For the chataamari, soak rice and black lentils in water overnight. Rinse the soaked rice and lentils mixture thoroughly. Using a mortar and pestle, ground mixture into a smooth batter-like paste, one small batch at a time. Pour into a large mixing bowl and add cumin seeds and salt to taste. Mix thoroughly and add more water as necessary to keep that batter consistency. Let the batter rest for at least six hours, covered, in the fridge. 2. When ready to prepare, take out the batter from the fridge and let it come down to room temperature. Make the stuffing. Heat oil in a skillet and sauté garlic and ginger until light brown. Add chicken with some salt and pepper. Brown the meat under medium-heat. Add chilis, tomato, cheese and scallions. Stir for a few minutes in low heat until the chicken is thoroughly cooked. Add salt and pepper to taste. 3. To assemble chataamaris, heat a tablespoon of clarified butter in a large non-stick skillet over medium-low heat. Pour in some batter and spread out into a paper-thin crepe. Cook until the bottom has crisped up. Scoop some of the chicken stuffing and add on top of one side of the chataamari. Using a heat-resistant spatula, turn over the other half of the chataamari to cover. Turn and cook the other side until crispy. Repeat until you finish the batter.

72 Bedford and Commerce Streets212/366.9410about $125 for two, with two drinks, without tip Whenever I am in the West Village, I always stop by Casa and look in. I tell myself that I should get Brazilian food next time. One Saturday night, all the surrounding restaurants had an hour-long wait so we ended there and were seated promptly. With our caipirinhas, we started with four appetizers to share. The beef carpaccio with watercress and hearts of palm was pretty good but I prefer my parmesan shaved rather than grated. The lightly breaded squid was overcooked and extra chewy so we barely finished it. We also shared the salada completa which convinced us that the hearts of palm was from a can. The greens needed a healthy drizzle of good olive oil to be resuscitated. Our one consolation was the Brazilian sausage with sauteed onions. It was spicy and salty but finally hit the spot. I had high hopes for Casa but how can I ever order from the main courses when they can't even get the most simple appetizers right?

2841 Eighth Avenue between 151st and 152nd Streets212/926.4313about $15 for two, with two drinks, without tip It's hard to find the best fried chicken place in Harlem because there are plenty of places you can choose from. I have to admit, I didn't even give Charlie's a chance until I saw a New York Times clipping on their window. But if the Times can make it uptown, there was just no reason why I shouldn't be eating there, too. And I'm glad I did. I walked in after 4pm and paid for an all-you-can-eat buffet plate plus a drink for $11.99. Visit before 4pm and the price is $9.99 because it's not dinner time although I'm pretty sure the food I was paying $2 more for was the same choices from earlier in the day. The fried chicken might not have been freshly fried but it was still delicious. The collard greens and the sweet potatoes were among my favorites. Next door is their take-away store where three fried chicken legs and two sides plus a cornbread cost me $9 another night. If you're in a hurry, it's the way to go.

If you have a food processor, it will save your life when you try this recipe. It's not the making of the rolls that took time, it was the cutting of the vegetables. Ingredients: 1 small daikon, julienned 1 small green papaya, julienned 1 carrot, julienned 1 cucumber, julienned 2 small packets of rice vermicelli a handful of mint leaves, coarsely chopped a handful basil, coarsely chopped a handful of cilantro, coarsely chopped lime juice a splash of fish sauce a splash of rice vinegar 1 small knob of ginger, peeled and minced 3 shallots, finely chopped a splash of heavy cream 1 tbsp Greek yogurt rice paper wrappers 1 cup of sugar salt 1. In a large bowl, toss the vegetables with salt and sugar. Let stand, stirring ocassionally, until wilted and have released a good amount of liquid, about 1 hour. Drain and squeeze out as much of the liquid as possible using a cheese cloth or paper towel. Return to bowl. 2. In a saucepan, bring water to a boil and add vermicelli. Turn off the heat, cover and cook noodles for about 4 minutes. Drain and cool in cold water. Drain again and squeeze out all the liquid. Cut the noodles into shorter pieces using kitchen scissors and add to the bowl of vegetables with the cilantro, mint and basil. 3. In a small bowl, combine the fish sauce, lime juice and vinegar. Stir in some sugar to dissolve. Add ginger and shallots and pour over the vegetables and let stand for about an hour. Save some of this dressing. 4. Prepare one rice paper at a time by filling a pie plate with warm water and soaking until pliable. Lay the wrappers on a chopping board and blot out any water with paper towel. 5. Scoop some of the mixture onto the bottom of the paper and roll into a small log, tucking ends as you roll. Cover rolls with damp paper towel and Saran wrap while working on other rolls. 6. With the leftover dressing, whisk in a little bit of cream and yogurt and use as dip. Related post/s: Asia Food Market has rice papers

Before Alex left for Buenos Aires, she told me that chimichurri always accompany asado, or grilled meats, in Argentina. I actually added the red wine vinegar to this recipe to have some more liquid in it. When I was done, I knew it was missing onions and a sprinkle of lemon juice. Alex's mom wanted me to play with it and adjust it to my liking-I felt that was good enough permission to mess with this traditional salsa recipe. I bought a few pieces of beef bottom round, browned and baked them in the oven for a couple of minutes for some medium-rare goodness. I sliced the meat in smaller pieces and served them with crispy lettuce. I had this very satisfying meal with chilled white wine. I've never regretted not having wheat beer in my fridge as I did that night. Ingredients: 1 cup flat-leaf parsley, finely chopped 4 cloves garlic, minced and finely chopped 1 small red onion, finely chopped 1 tsp oregano 1 tsp dried hot red-pepper flakes, or more 1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil 1/3 cup red wine vinegar squeeze of fresh lemon juice salt 1. In a bowl, slowly whisk in red wine vinegar with the olive oil. Add all the other ingredients. Use pepper flakes, salt and lemon juice to taste.

225 Park Avenue South between 18th and 19th Streets212/533-2500$130 for three, with a few drinks, with tip A last-minute decision after a much-needed downpour led us to Barca 18 off Union Square for some stiff drinks and small plates of Spanish food. The spicy chorizo hit the spot and left us hungry for more. We ordered the dry cured pork loin and the Catalan Garrotxa cheese ($4 for two small pieces) before we shared the crab pizza topped with tarragon and roasted peppers, the octopus with sweet pepper confit and the lamb skewers in red pepper chutney which interestingly tasted just like the chorizo. A small pan of paella negra with mussels and shrimps in squid ink sealed our night. Catalan pizza with crab pieces and parmigiano The bar is at a first come-first served basis but a larger dining room takes reservations. The waitresses, as soon as you get their attention, are more alert than the busboys because a couple of plates meant for the small table next to us came our way. Suits from the investment banks in the area swarm Barca 18 but for an Eric Ripert-Brian O'Donohoe partnership, I can let that, and some sinewy lamb, slide.

Pritsana manages to cook and cater for about thirty people when she's not busy designing print materials and Web sites for non-profit organizations and for-profit companies. Now, if only her mother would believe that she can actually cook. Parents are always looking out for their children, so whenever Pritsana would visit them with dishes she cooked, they refuse to eat them because they're thinking that she needs to eat more than they do. Sometimes, parents never realize that their children can get food without their help. Ka Prow translates to the Thai holy basil, one of the staples of Thai cooking and the main spice to this dish. (You leave off the R when you pronounced the prow.) We used chicken here and Thai locals would refer to it as Ka Prow Gai in which gai is the chicken. You can find kaffir lime leaves at a well-stocked Asian grocery store. They usually have them in the freezer so ask one of the clerks to make sure they're not hiding the goods from you. There really isn't a perfect substitute for them, but if you can't get them dried, try using lime zest. You can also get Thai holy basil at the same store, but you can substitute the tinier, more purple sweet basil. Italian basil will do, too, if you don't have access to Asian produce. You can also use brown sugar instead of the palm, and less soy sauce if you're not using the semi-sweet kind. Thais cook this dish with ground pork and I can imagine you can use shrimps as well. Top with fried egg and you'll be smiling. Ingredients: 8 pieces of boneless chicken thighs, cut into small pieces 1 bunch of Thai holy basil 2 Thai chilis, seeds removed 2 kaffir lime leaves half a red onion, finely chopped 4 garlic cloves, minced and finely chopped semi-sweet black soy sauce or kecap manis 1 tbsp palm sugar a splash of fish sauce 2 tbsp peanut oil 1. Heat some oil in a heated large wok. Sauté garlic until light brown and cook onions until translucent. Add chicken and enough soy sauce to cover half of them. Cook chicken while stirring occasionally, about 10 minutes. 2. When chicken is almost done, stir in the rest of the ingredients and cook for another 5 over medium-low heat or until basil leaves are wilted.

34 West 32nd Street between Broadway and Fifth, 2nd floor212/564-8200about $100 for two, with two drinks, without tip Their business card says Seoul Garden Restaurant but you might know it as Natural Tofu. People come here for the tofu chigaes, boiling hot woks of spicy broths with seafood or pork, all with tofu and bean sprouts. Meant to be shared between at least two people, it's the ultimate food for those who are just winding down their night of drinking. What I come to Natural Tofu for, however, is their gae jang, raw crabs stewed in a hot soy sauce. I get into these moods where all I want is raw seafood and if I don't mean sushi, I go for crabs Korean style.

Lisa's dad said that this Italian version of ratatouille has two names, depending on whether you live in the south of Italy or the north. Whether you grew up calling it cianbotta or cianfotta, it means \"tasteful and colorful.\" It's a rural dish that farm folks learned to make after experiencing the hardships caused by the second World War. Lisa's mom remembers this as very delicious and nutritious; the vegetables taking the place of meat, which was unaffordable during those times. Even though the recipe still represents poverty to a lot of the older generation, it's a comfort food that evokes unforgettable childhood memories. Harold McGee recommends you salt the eggplant pieces after you slice them. This draws out the moisture and collapses their spongy texture, so they don't absorb all the oil when you start cooking them. Ingredients: 1 large red bell pepper 6 small red-skinned potatoes 3 plum tomatoes 1 zucchini 1 eggplant 1 large onion a handful of fresh basil leaves olive oil, salt and pepper 1. Cut all vegetables into 1/4-inch pieces. In a small pot, boil potatoes in salted water until half cooked. Set aside. 2. Heat oil in a large skillet. Add onions and cook until soft. Add potatoes and peppers. Cook for about 10 minutes on low heat. Add the rest of the vegetables including the basil. Add salt and pepper to taste. 3. Cook until vegetables are soft, about 15 minutes. Enjoy as a side dish or as a main course, served with fresh Italian garlic bread. Related post/s: About Cooking the World: Global Gastronomy Food Project Ratatouille is the French version

So I need your help. Starting July 2006, I'm going to be cooking. A lot. More so than I do now. The idea is to cook a traditional family recipe from someone's country. I'd like to represent as many countries as I can. I want to learn more about other cuisines but at the same time, I also want to go in search of new ingredients in New York City. I don't have a name for the project yet so I could use some suggestions for that, too. Send me an email with your family recipe and I'll add it to my list. If you can attach your personal story with it, that would be great. I'd like to understand where it's coming from. Update: Thank you for all your suggestions and recipes so far. Keep them coming! A lot of you suggested naming this project The World on a Plate but after some Googling, I found out that the name is already being used. I also like the Around the World idea but I'm keeping the category name to group the entries under it as Cooking the World-for now-because I wanted the verb \"cook\" in there. Someone else suggested Global Gastronomy and even though gastronomy is such a huge word, it gave me an idea to add my own notes and research to each of my entries. I'll be studying and learning at my own pace throughout this project, too, so I think all the interdisciplinary activities involved in gastronomy might apply. I honestly don't know where this will go but join me as I search for recipes from all over the world and listen to the stories attached to them through friends and acquaintances.

85 Tenth Avenue on 16th Street212/497-8090$810 for six, with a few drinks, with tip The latest from the Batali-Bastianich empire, Del Posto's staircase, marble floors and plush seating all scream money. You walk past the valet (!) through the lobby and it's like you're in someone's mansion outside of New York. Its 18,000-square-foot space is larger than any of their other New York City restaurants and showcase extravagance, if not gaudiness. The menu prices scream dollar signs, too. The antipasto misto of cheese, olives and prosciutto cost us $66 and the bis, two pastas also divided in six servings cost us a whopping $126. My squab was too rare for my taste but I held back in telling the kitchen because the accompanying wine, Feudi Taurasi 1999, made up for it. The pork chop had just the right amount of sweetness with the figs and caramelized onion on the side and I must say that the lamb loin was very good. The cod was meaty and perfectly tender. We could have skipped the bis, really, but the pesto and chanterelles were hard to miss. The food could have been from any other high-priced restaurant in the city. Nothing really stood out for me to exclaim, This is so Batali. My lamb sweetbreads were a delight and the calf's liver-unfortunately served as a main course-were so light and tasty. But where were the lamb's tongue and the pig trotters I've been hearing about? They were probably in the $100 tasting menu we passed up or maybe they were the specials our server forgot to tell us about. But for an early 6:30pm table of six women, the service was exemplary. Our sommelier needs to be commended for helping us pick champagne (a Philipponnat) and two bottles of red wine without flinching at our budget ($60-$65 per bottle). When we started with the bubbly, we mentioned that we're celebrating a birthday. At the end of our meal, they brought one of our desserts with a candle without us having to request it. Needless to say, the birthday girl was quite pleased.

90 Bedford Street on the corner of Grove 212/741.4695 $100 for two, with two drinks, with tip ♥ ♥ ♥ We told ourselves we will find another place in the West Village if the wait for a table at The Little Owl was unbearable. Thankfully, we were seated right away when we walked in at 7pm because I would have missed the soft-shell crab and asparagus, the sardines with green beans and the hamachi with coleslaw. Match that with a bottle of chilled white wine and you wouldn't have gone anywhere else either. Flash-frying soft-shell crabs are hard because cooking them a second over will give you mushy but chewy meat. Here, they were just the right amount of crispiness. The beans balanced the saltiness of the sardines. I could have done without the coleslaw but I must say that the pink inside of the hamachi gave me joy together with the light onion rings. What used to be Chez Michallet is now an even sweeter space with white-washed walls and chef Joey Campanaro behind the glass-covered kitchen. Sitting at the bar gave us a peek of the action in the tiny kitchen. Our server was very attentive and never let us see our wine glasses empty. Our orders were always split in two so there was no awkward sharing. It was almost ninety degrees outside but it felt very comfortable inside.

Our last full day was spent at the club house, poolside. We didn't want to drive anywhere since we have to catch our flight so we sunbathed at the pool with all the gossip magazines we could pick up. I got more tanned there under a couple of hours than I did in Honduras. I devoured a medium-rare burger with my dark beer while Lauren enjoyed the chicken wrap with her Heineken Light. Cheers! It was sad to leave Florida. The S's have been so nice to me. It was a bummer to end our long weekend together. I think Sonny and I finally got along I wish we knew there was a storm approaching New York City though, so we didn't have to sit in the plane on the runway for several hours. Thank goodness for satellite TV and my trustworthy Bosse headphones, I got to catch up with Anthony Bourdain in Indonesia (El Bulli feature in two weeks, people!) and a really cool documentary on Tokyo. Grouchy-looking Sonny but he was really excellent Sonny was the best dog ever even with the four-hour delay. He would just take a peek from his bag and check if his mommy was still around. When he had that confirmed, he would just go right back inside; no whining and complaining like the two women behind us who gave the flight attendants a hard time. It took six hours to get back to Harlem instead of the expected three but I was very content with my weekend.

Sunday was still muggy but the clouds looked very angry. The sun stayed hidden so we spent the rest of the morning at a place the locals call Downtown. I wanted to cook for the S's so we drove to Publix and bought the necessary ingredients. (I love supermarkets outside of Manhattan!) The produce looked nice even though they didn't have Brussels sprouts. I had to rework the menu that I was initially thinking about. We went to yet another mall after that but this time to lazily check out the merchandise on sale. The rain finally stopped some time in the afternoon so we all decided to go to the beach and take a walk. It was the only beach which allowed dogs so Sonny and Freddy came with us. The surfers were out because the winds earlier in the day brought some nice waves in. There were all sorts of dogs on the beach, big and small. I kept thinking of California while I was enjoying the scene. My gracious hosts Back at home, I started preparing for dinner. We all hung out in the backyard while I grilled portobello mushrooms, squash and asparagus. The oven in the kitchen was broiling bacon and apples. I made my favorite summer salad to start and we opened the bottles of Reisling I brought with me. I threw the pork tenderloin in the oven for a quick roast and put together all the vegetables. Dinner was good and complete.

I can only imagine how bored meteorologists must be in Florida if it isn't hurricane season. Good morning! It's hot out today! I was packing my beach bag while the TV was on and all I could think of was, No shit. It wasn't even 9am and it was already sweltering. And the central air was on! The water at Peanut Island After breakfast, we drove to the dock and took the ferry to Peanut Island. We donned our snorkeling gear before the tide started to rise for lunch time. I was pretty much satisfied after I saw a barracuda frowning at me. It was feeding time and all the small fish were out and about. There were flying fish, too. I just sat out the rest of the afternoon with ocassional dips to save my skin from melting. Pretty nice looking man-made beach When it got unbearably hot, we took the ferry back and ate lunch at Tiki Bar and Grill. The conch salad was a fresh starter and it only got better with fish and chips and a cold, cold glass of lemonade. (Beer would have been better but I didn't have my I.D. with me!) Conch salad with crackers On our way back, we stopped by the turtle sanctuary to see this big guy: His shell was cracked by a boat propeller and he was being rehabilitated before he will be set free in July. I pretty much passed out back at the S's home after that. Late in the afternoon, we drove to City Place for dinner. It reminded me of Los Angeles' The Grove, live band, fountains and all. Dinner was Cuban food at Cabana and boy, was my craving for pork ever fulfilled! Mmmm-mm chuletas! We also shared the ceviche mix, the plantains and the beef served with yellow rice and black beans. Two pitchers of red sangria were consumed.

My first reaction upon arriving in Florida was, Oh, my god. Can it be any hotter than this? When Lauren mentioned several months ago that she was visiting her newly-retired parents in West Palm Beach, she extended the invitation to me since I've never been to Florida before. For a $145 round-trip weekend fare, I had no reason to refuse. Palm tree galore: while driving from the airport We arrived on Friday just before sunset. It was so hot I thought of Central America. The only difference was that it was spotless and all nicely set up-like the private communities in Las Vegas. It felt wrong to be there. Water sprinkles were spraying all over the manicured lawns. The air conditioning was blasting in every car, every room of the house, every restaurant and shopping store. It made me wonder how much energy a place like West Palm Beach uses each day. Sonny all tired from the flight After settling in, Mr. and Mrs. S gave me a tour of their lovely home. The ceilings were high, the kitchen fully-equipped, the garden...well, there was an actual garden! We also took a walk around their neighborhood and visited the club house with the pool. I'm not a big pool fan but I made a mental note to stop by before flying back to New York City. Welcome to the neighborhood! Sonny was nervous during the flight but as soon as we were on steady ground, he was the usual spoiled sweetheart. Freddy is Mr. and Mrs. S's dog and he seemed bothered that there was another poodle in the house. He was less snotty throughout my stay but he made it known he was still king. (He would shake his fur after I would try to touch him.) Freddy and Sonny minding their own businesses For dinner, we drove to the Reef Grill and ordered several seafood appetizers. Everything had the Florida essence in it, from the tuna to the shrimps, the scallops to the swordfish. It was an absolutely beautiful night even though it was muggy. There's nothing better than stepping out of a restaurant with a full stomach in a place I've never been before.

I love making this mussels dish because it only takes a splash of white wine and some herbs I usually have handy anyway. Ingredients: 1 bag of mussels, about 2 pounds, beard and barnacles cleaned and scraped off 1 cup dry white wine 2 shallots, chopped 2 tbsps unsalted butter a handful of flat parsley, chopped 1. Put the shallots and white wine into a large stainless steel pot. Add the mussels and cover. Steam them over high heat until the mussels have opened, about 5 minutes. Shake the pot to be sure that all the mussels are cooked. 2. Drain the mussels into a large bowl, saving the liquid. Discard unopened mussels. Return the liquid to the pot and bring to a boil. Add the butter and chopped parsley. Pour this sauce over the mussels and serve immediately.

Before breakfast, we decided to run on the beach. Of course, I lasted for only two trips from the beachfront to the end of West Bay. After breakfast, I thought it'd be a great idea to bike around the area. We borrowed the Bananarama bikes even though it was already 85 degrees before 10am. Of course, I lasted one hill before I begged the Dr. to turn around and give up with me. We spent more time laughing at ourselves than the actual biking. After all that \"effort\", we decided that the rest of the day would be spent under the shade, on the beach and near the water. At La Palapa, the only thatched-roof beachfront bar on West Bay, we bought several beers during lunch while the cook fried the two snappers we caught the day before. She served them with fried plantains. For dinner, we returned and bought more beers. The cook fried the last of our catch, the grouper, with some fries. The next day, we hired another water taxi driver to take us snorkeling. We couldn't find Luna, the guy who took us fishing the day before, so another guy ripped us off by convincing us he was going to take us to the Blue Channel to snorkel. When he anchored the boat, I could still see the beach. This is Blue Channel?, we asked. For $50, we thought Blue Channel was far away, but we were already deep in vacation mode to even argue. We said bye to our money and snorkeled around the so-called channel. There were the usual fish: parrot, grouper and snappers. The water was clear and my vest kept me afloat. After only an hour, we asked to be dropped off at West End where we finally found some good food with our beers. Walking down the main street, we saw a lady with a basket. We asked her what she was selling and she said she had chicken tamales with cheese and beans. They were soft tortillas instead of masa wrapped in corn husks, but for thirty limpiras, or $2, for three pieces, we were sold. We sat under a tree at the beach and ate our first meal of the day. I was still hungry, so we walked a little bit more to find the fruit guy with the pickup truck. We instead saw a tent where another lady was grilling chicken. She was selling them with rice and beans for seventy limpiras, less than $4. I sat on one of her plastic chairs and the Dr. positioned himself on top of a crate. We shared a plate under her tent with a cold bottle of Coke. Our entire lunch was better than anything we paid $10 for on the island. Sometimes, street food is all you need to get a better sense of the local cuisine. We spent more time on the beach the rest of the afternoon and savored our last full day in the country. We met our Bananarama neighbors earlier and found out that they were from Colorado. When we saw them later at La Palapa, we agreed to take the last water taxi to West End to eat dinner together and split a cab back after hours. We ended up at Velva's where my meal was served in some salty tomato concoction. I had ordered a snapper, but they instead served me shrimps. After we ate, the four of us walked around to find a bar, but unfortunately everything was already closed. We paid $10 for a cab to drive us back to West Bay. Thankfully, La Palapa was still open. The owners were wrapping up a private party on the beach, so the bartender bought us a round of drinks and we enjoyed the last few minutes of the fire they built. We flew out of Roatan the next day not knowing anything about Honduran culture and its people, but we were grateful for our time and for the opportunity to check off another Central American country from our list.

Clink. Clink. Clink. What the hell! It was 7am and the divers were already getting the tanks out of storage to prepare for the day's dive. We would not be able to sleep in the following days because of the diving preparations each morning. Roatan is a diving community, but because we don't dive-the Dr. became a certified diver a long time ago but has lost interest-we were more interested in snorkeling and just taking it easy. Bananarama Dive Resort is frequented by those who travel far to learn how to dive. We were just there because they had the nicest cabins for rent on West Bay, the more quiet side of Roatan island. After some anemic eggs and sausage and tortilla garnished with a hibiscus flower for breakfast, we took a water taxi from the dock several yards away to go to the West End, the opposite side of West Bay. The entire island of Roatan is only 34 miles long and West Bay has the best beach, but West End is where the stores, restaurants and bars are so it's teeming with life during the day. We walked around to get a feel of the island. We bought some fruits from the guy with the pickup truck, canvassed prices for snorkeling trips and visited some gift shops. We were pretty disappointed that condos were being built all over the beach, some priced at $300,000. It's inevitable, right? But when we were in Panama, the settlers were mindful not to build tall concrete buildings in the mountains or the beach. Roatan looked like it was just waiting to be the next Florida. It wasn't even noon yet and the sun was already out in full force. We settled for Creolan food at Bertie's because the Honduran restaurant the water taxi driver recommended was still closed. The only problem was that the fried chicken we ordered for $8 did not taste Creolan at all. In fact, there was nothing Creolan in the menu. We would find out through our stay that food prices on the island range from $5 to $18 and those just include a small bowl of soup and a plate of fried fish with a sorry piece of iceberg lettuce they called salad. Alas, we're tourists just like everyone else so we just had to suck it up. Late in the afternoon, we hired this guy Luna to take us fishing for two hours. If we can't get a decent meal on the island, well, we're just going to have to catch it, right? We got in his boat and we asked where the bait was. We're going to get it!, he exclaimed. We docked back at West End and we watched him wade in the water with his big kitchen knife, stabbing all the crabs he saw. With the crabs, we caught three small yellowtail snappers to use as bait. We trawled in his boat for two hours, but the fish weren't biting. We had to revert to the old-fashioned way and anchored the boat, waited for the smaller fish to bite and hoped for the best. Luna entertained us. His stories all started with My-uncle-this and My-uncle-that. He laughed like a maniac. We found ourselves laughing at him rather than with him. Later, when we told other locals that we had hired Luna during our first day, their reaction was always, You hired Luna?! Apparently, he's notorious on the island as the town lunatic. The Dr. got lucky and caught two yellowtail snappers right away. Soon after, we had a grouper. (Endangered, we know, but Darwin made a good point!) The sun came down fast after that. When we caught a slimy, we knew it was time to go back to the beach. Back at West Bay after cleaning up for the night, we bought a Cuban sandwich, a plate of pasta and fish ceviche for dinner from the restaurant in the Mayan Princess Resort. No fish that night because we had three waiting in the fridge for the next day. Related post/s: Hello, Honduras Roatan, Honduras photos on Flickr

We woke up early to catch our Atlanta flight that connected us to San Pedro Sula in Honduras. We spent a lot of time waiting at the airport before we boarded the flight to La Ceiba and then to our final destination, Roatan. The sun was setting when Omar picked us up. As soon as we checked in at Bananarama Dive Resort, we took a walk to check out the scene. We were spent, but the sunset made it all worth it. The island was deserted-we later found out that there was a national football match going on and that's why none of the Hondurans could be bothered. We felt like we had the beach to ourselves. When darkness enveloped us, we began our search for our first Honduran meal. We started with the conch soup at Foster's. We also ordered rice and beans with a fried red snapper. We've tried the Barena beer at the airport, so we ordered the Salva Vida this time. I read that one company owns all the Honduran breweries, so all the beers basically tasted the same. We sat in one of the palapas on the beach, away from the restaurant, to eat our dinner. The warm wind was blowing, the stars were out and all we could hear beyond the darkness were the waves crashing. Automatically, we switched to our don't-care-about-anything-else-right-now mode.

239 East 5th Street off 2nd Avenue 212/979.1012 $130 for two, with two drinks, with tip ♥ ♥ ♥ The latest from the Jack and Grace Lamb empire, Degustation is the replacement for Jewel Bako's robato grill next door. They kept the same layout: an open kitchen where you can sit at the bar and watch everything unfold as you wait for your food. This time around, polite Latino chefs show their skills behind the counter instead of the more familiar Asian chefs along Second Avenue. Head chef Wesley Genovart, fresh from Perry St., is twenty-six years old and looks it, too, but he's adventurous enough to fry artichokes with Kumamoto oyster in mussel broth and celery leaves. He's smart enough to recognize that a slowly poached egg can be served with Serrano ham in chicken broth and, bless his heart, stuff a squid with braised short ribs and serve it with lentils. The lamb was perfectly grilled with hen-of-the-woods mushrooms and served with a sauce simply called \"chlorophyll\" which was, you guessed it, green in color. The pork belly is so crisp, the fat just screams Eat Me as soon as the plate arrives in front of you. The grapefruit in caramel water was the perfect complement to the seared foie gras and the lemon juice went well with the grilled jumbo shrimps. To end our night out, one of the chefs grilled strawberries and served it with ginger granita and basil and mint sauce. My only regret was not ordering this in between our seafood and meat courses to cleanse our palate. Our 8pm reservation was easy to get, but we ended up waiting for forty minutes at the door to be seated. The staff never forgot us and served us complementary glasses (two each!) of champagne while we waited. A croquet amuse started us off and they still kept us in mind after six dishes and served us a wild arugula salad with ham and almonds to show their appreciation for our patience. For a minute, I forgot that we were in New York City because of the exceptional service but, really, where else can I get this much good food for under a hundred dollars?

178 Broadway, right under the Williamsburg Bridge in Brooklyn 718/387-7400 about $400 for four, with a bottle of wine, with tip, cash only ♥ ♥ ♥ Most New Yorkers will think of Peter Luger when porterhouse is the topic of conversation. How could we not when it's been around since, oh, 1887. Even our cab driver knew where Peter Luger was. You mean the boo-jee steak place? when we only mentioned the steakhouse by the Williamsburg Bridge. Since some of us have eaten here before, we knew to split the porterhouse for two between four people because we ordered the fresh bacon, two salads and creamed spinach with our meat. Our waiter was obviously disappointed when we refused the steak for four but lit up when we ordered the 2002 Cakebread with it. We were a bit dismayed when our waiter brought a 2003 bottle and told us that he had run out of the 2002. Good thing my friend was aware of the fact that the 2003 harvest wasn't worth the 2002 price. When we tried to order a less expensive bottle instead, our waiter returned with the 2002 and told us he just \"found it\" in the cellar. He was this close to opening that 2003 bottle and charging us the 2002 price! Tsk to Peter Luger! It pays to know something about your wines.

203 East 10th Street off Second Avenue 212/995.9511 $104 for four, desserts only with matching drinks, with tip ♥ ♥ If you have room for dessert, Chika will whip up one of the most simple yet satisfying desserts for you at ChikaLicious, a tiny space on 10th Street. Assuming, of course, that they haven't sold out by 11pm or that you're not waiting to be seated for more than 20 minutes. The prix fixe is only $19 and includes an amuse, a main dessert, petit fours and a glass of wine. Your choices for main desserts run from the creative, like kiwi in lavender soup, to the surprising, like peppercorn ice cream and red wine sauce with warm chocolate tart. Update, 2008: They have opened ChikaLicious Puddin' across the street that serves three kinds-at least when we visited-of \"puddin'\". Light, fluffy and sweet, their puddings are the perfect end to a blistery winter night.

558 Broome Street between Sixth Avenue and Varick Street212/226.4399 about $100 for three, BYOB, without tip I was so happy to find another restaurant that let us bring our own wine for no corking fee. My friends from Los Angeles were in town and I had a bottle of Uruguayan red wine on my desk at work. Even though it was a rainy Friday night, we braved SoHo and waited at the bar next door to be seated at Ivo & LuLu. Listings say the menu is French Caribbean: the rabbit and boar saucissons are truly francais except for the extra kick in the spice. The grilled avocado with spinach mousse was interesting but even more so with shiitake-sesame dressing. The rain outside just made it more comfortable inside this sliver of a space off the Holland Tunnel. I came with four other people during my second visit. We ordered the entire menu-less than 15 dishes-and shared everything with two bottles of wine. The French owners ended up closing the restaurant while we were still inside. They served us desserts on the house and sat with us to smoke and chat. We found out that the bar next door is now part of the restaurant during a more recent visit. Three of us shared five dishes with two bottles of wine: the duck confit which was crispy outside, yet soft inside. The mussels in an addicting spicy sauce. The potato gratin and the roasted pear with blue cheese. The winter squash, roasted and served in its shell-the mushiness of the meat with carrots and peas was very comforting. I'm not sure if they will take the wall that separates the two spaces down but I hope the coziness of the place won't change. I also hope that the food will stay the same.

Our waiter didn't say anything when we ordered two salads and one main course so my only complaint is not being advised to order less. The owner's antique expertise showed in the lamps It was a warm Thursday night and I thought of walking over to TriBeCa to see if we can score a seat at the Turkish restaurant set up by Osman Cakir, the same owner of the antique store of the same name in the West Village. It turns out his antique expertise is more useful when it comes to picking more than fifty bottles of wine from around the world and small Turkish specialties like lamb kebab, cucumber salad with yogurt and mint sauce and grilled swordfish.

458 West 17th Street off Tenth Avenue 212/929.8544 about $400 for six plus room fee, with a few drinks, with tip ♥ When I get slow service in a restaurant, I'm usually ticked off, but for some reason I always excuse it when it comes to a Japanese restaurant. Do you do this? They're so polite that even when they make a mistake, I find myself apologizing for them. The menu at Naka Naka is limited; mostly familiar rolls like spicy tuna, salmon and tuna with avocado, unagi and tempura. The uni comes in both the light and the dark yellow colors and the hamachi is excellent, but without their daily specials-written on a whiteboard presented by the waitress-you'll end up with less than five choices. Some of the appetizer dishes are tasty but unexciting: lotus root, deep fried fish, Japanese pickles and tofu. They also serve hot and cold soba and udon soups. They didn't replace our bowls throughout our entire meal. We awkwardly shared small dishes meant to be for one or two people because we didn't have too many choices. It got so busy at the restaurant, we had to remind our waitress about our lotus root and fried fish orders. Getting refills for water and beer was difficult. I'd return to Naka Naka if all I wanted was a simple Japanese experience around the neighborhood. In Meatpacking District standards, it's a very small restaurant but still, an extra $10 per person was added to our bill for reserving the tatami room separated from the main dining bar. It's a refuge from the zoo that is the party district, but that's all there is to Naka Naka.

We ordered the foie gras in honor of our Chicago friends who won't be able to enjoy it anymore. It came with country ham and pickled watermelon and black eyed peas. The Peking duck pizza hit the spot and was absolutely delicious. The scallions in the hoisin sauce was a nice kick with the fresh mozarella and tomatoes. Mmm, mmm sauteed foie gras Peking duck pizza We could have stopped there but two glasses each of the Pinot Gris and the Sauvignon Blanc from New Zealand made us order the Hudson burger with Niman Ranch bacon served with fries and cheese. The space is gorgeous and perhaps the most good looking \"cafeteria\" you will lay your eyes on. The dark wood, high ceilings and tall windows make the space inviting that you forget you're inside a hotel in the first place.

50 Clinton Street between Stanton and Rivington Streets 212/477.2900 about $300 for two, with a bottle of wine, with tip ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ Wylie Dufresne, how do I love thee? Let me count the ways... 1. Pickled beef tongue with fried mayonnaise and onion streusel. I loved the beef tongue carpaccio style; you can barely remember it was pickled. And fried and cubed mayonnaise? It was worth ordering just to find out how the hell they would do it. 2. Octopus with celery pesto, pineapple and tiny bits of mojama, or dry tuna, and marcona almonds. Celery pesto is something I've never had before. 3. Corned duck, rye crisp, purple mustard and horseradish. Our waiter told us this is the mainstay on the wd-50 menu and that it was an absolute must-try. He was right. The mini parsleys were a nice touch. 4. Root vegetable \"lasagna\" with sweet and sour mushroom broth. I tasted carrots, parsnip and burdock in there. Perhaps beets were not in season. Lasagna is in quotes because the familiar layering technique was used. The mushrooms were a delight to eat, but I wish this came in a smaller portion. 5. Rack of lamb, sauerkraut spaetzle, swiss cheese consomme. We finished a bottle of wine from Piedmont and all I remember about the lamb was that it melted in my mouth. We ordered medium, but it was definitely rare. Divine. 6. Kumquat confit, carob ice cream, or St. John's Bread, a pea pod that looks like cocoa but without the caffeine, with soy caramel. The kumquat was chewy, but I wondered if it would be any softer if cooked longer. 7. Caramelized banana, smoked chocolate ice cream and stout. I have no clue how one would smoke ice cream, but we paused after every spoonful and asked, Is that bacon I taste? 8. Thin crisps in a wooden box. I had to ask our waiter to take them away because I couldn't stop picking from it. A very expensive meal for two, but worth every penny.

78 Second Avenue at 4th Street 212/253.5410 about $200 for five, with two bottles of wine, without tip ♥ ♥ Three of us drank two bottles of Algerian red wine while waiting for the rest of our group. When the five of us were complete, we shared two lamb shanks that were so tender, the meat just came off the bones when our forks touched it. Two order of crab cakes were the least African on the menu, yet they were still tasty. I liked their tagine so much I could have eaten one more serving. The seafood pancake was so-so and the chicken kebab tasted like, well, chicken. We were seated at the front and the breeze would come in every time someone opened the door. We asked to be moved when the back room freed up, but the manager never returned to accommodate us even though they told us they just needed to clean up in the back. Minus that one slip, the waiters were almost unnoticable which could be a good thing when you're just enjoying the food and the company you're with.

I love making my own tomato sauce in the summer because the plump and juicy tomatoes are available in the market. Once transfered to a covered container, your tomato sauce keeps a week in the fridge. You can also store them in the freezer to make them last for several months. Just make sure that the sauce is completely cool before you cover and transfer them to store. A lot of pasta dishes with tomato sauce are so easy to make. When I know I want pasta for dinner, I just take out my frozen sauce from the freezer and let it sit in the fridge. I just completely heat it up with my favorite ingredients. Ingredients: 5 vine-riped tomatoes, quartered 1 small carrot, peeled, shredded 3 sprigs of fresh thyme 4 cloves of garlic, minced 1 red onion, sliced thinly olive oil, salt, pepper 1. In a large saucepan, heat some olive oil over medium heat. Sauté garlic until light brown and cook onions until transparent. Add the thyme and carrots and cook for about 5 minutes. 2. With your hands, add the tomatoes while crushing them with your hands. Get all of the tomatoes and their juice to the pot. Simmer, stirring often and cook until the sauce is thick. Season with salt and pepper. 3. Set aside to let cool. When cool enough, transfer to a sealable container.

Filipino Lengua, Tongue Stew

***CONTENT
I returned to Chinatown and easily picked up tongue or lengua [leng-gwah]. I picked the veal's tongue because, well, the pig's tongue looked like a part of the male anatomy. There is another Spanish-influenced dish, lengua estofada, but I wanted a dish that was more appropriate for spring, so I decided to make something lighter. My mother watched me cook and gave me simple instructions from what she could remember from her aunt, my Apong. When I unwrapped the tongue, this massive muscle was in front of me and I thought, How the hell do I peel the skin off? After boiling it for about an hour, the skin actually turned white. It looked like a small foot than a tongue! Peeling the skin off was as easy as taking off a sock. Weird, I know, but you'll see what I mean when you try it. Ingredients: 1 veal’s tongue, washed thoroughly with salt under cold running water 3 fresh green chili peppers 1 red onion, roughly chopped 3 cloves garlic, minced 2 large tomatoes, halved and sliced 2 tbsps soy sauce a handful of parsley, finely chopped salt, pepper, olive oil 1. Simmer tongue in a large pot of water, about 1 hour. Remove from pot and let cool enough to handle. Peel skin from tongue and trim gristle. Cut into 1/4-inch slices. 2. In a large wok, sauté garlic and onions. Add chilis. Add tongue pieces and brown both sides. Stir in soy sauce and tomatoes and cook until soft. Cover and simmer for about 30 minutes until tongue is tender. Season with salt to taste and sprinkle with parsley to serve. Related post/s: Offal in Filipino cooking Where to buy veal's tongue

Thanks for your recipes. But it looks like you did not pre-boil the tripe and veal foot before cooking them. Tripe and all parts from the pata downwards should be boiled with salt and onions, the water discarded, then boiled again, until the smell is gone. Then that's the only time you start cooking.

Filipino Bopis, Pig's Heart Saute

For a less challenging dish, I skipped over the cow's penis at Dynasty Supermarket and opted for the pig's heart instead. I could have used pig's lungs, too, but they weren't available during my visit. Moving away from Spain, I chose bopis [boh-peace] to show the Chinese influence in Filipino cooking. The ethnic Chinese settled in the Philippines even before Magellan set foot in 1521. If the Spanish military did not beat the Chinese (and the Japanese, the Dutch and the British, too), the country would have more similarities to China than Spain. Of course, no colonizer had to tell us that bopis is enjoyed with a cold bottle of beer. Ingredients: 1 pig’s heart, thoroughly washed, boiled, minced 3 cloves of garlic, minced 1 onion, finely chopped 4 sprigs of thyme a handful of parsley, finely chopped 3 green chilis, sliced 1/4 cup of beef broth 1 carrot, finely chopped 1 small radish, finely chopped 1 red bell pepper, finely chopped 1/2 cup vinegar salt, pepper, oil 1. In a wok, sauté garlic and onion in hot oil. Add heart and season with salt and pepper and chilis. Cook for 5 minutes until golden brown. 2. Add vegetables and vinegar. Boil without stirring. Add beef broth and simmer until liquid evaporates. It's perfect when you're scraping brown bits from the bottom of your wok. Related post/s: Offal in Filipino cooking Where to buy a pig's heart

Even if I order a bowl of vermicelli noodles with beef or a rice plate with pork chops, I can still order a small bowl of pho as a dollar appetizer. Pho Bang also hasn't lost its touch in making spring and summer rolls.

The futuristic furniture and splashes of red are effective to the visitors afraid of the rest of Chinatown; not too ethnic and very modern. The dim sum platter is the safest bet if you're one of them. On weekends, come before noon or else you'll end up waiting in line behind tourists. Don't try to get the table by the window on the second floor if your group is less than four. The surly old Chinese man will only grumble and insist on the table away from the window anyway. Some things you just can't change.

Preheat oven to 450º. While oven heats, tie parsley, thyme and bay leaf in a bundle with kitchen string to make a bouquet garni. Spread beef bones, onions and carrot in roasting pan, then brown well in oven, turning occasionally, about 1 hour.2. Transfer meat and vegetables to a large stockpot. Add 2 cups water to roasting pan, then deglaze by boiling over high heat, stirring and scraping up brown bits, 2 minutes.3. Add deglazing liquid to stockpot along with 18 cups of water, celery, salt and the bouquet garni. Bring to a boil and skim froth. Add remaining 1/2 cup water, then bring mixture to a simmer and skim any froth. Simmer gently, uncovered, skimming froth occasionally, until liquid is reduced to about 8 cups, about 4 hours.4. Pour stock through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl, pressing hard on and then discarding solids. If using stock right away, skim off and discard fat. If not, cool stock completely, uncovered, then chill, covered (it will be easier to remove fat when chilled).

57 Great Jones Street off Bowery212/473.8458$105 for two, with two drinks, with tip Hideyuki Nakajima, or Hedeh as he is also known, had been a veteran of the Matsuhisa empire for several years before heading to New York to do his own thing. Minus all the hoopla Japanese restaurants now have to do to attract diners-giant Buddah, lotus pond-Hedeh keeps it simple and just focuses on the food. Just pepper my lamb with lots of cumin! Chicken tots with giant pepper There are Brussels sprouts under all that cheese They have since stopped their omakase offering because there are some great appetizers available a la carte. I couldn't help but order the lamb chop in cumin served with potatoes and Brussels sprouts. The small breaded chicken was also a delight but not as much as the smoked mozarella cheese over sprouts and miso. And who can't love bonito flakes sprinkled all over so that you can watch them \"move\" and sway? The sushi and sashimi are as good as you can get in the city without breaking the bank. They certainly make up for the weak drinks from the bar. All in all, I like Hedeh because it's tucked away from the loud crowd of Bowery. Plus, I really needed an alternative to Blue Ribbon Sushi of the same caliber.

70 Grand Street at Wythe Avenue, Wiliamsburg, Brooklyn718/388.5100about $125 for two, with a bottle of wine, without tip Dinner's always nice when a group of you eat and drink without feeling like you're at a restaurant. The waiter asks for your orders and serves them unobtrusively. He also knows when to ask if everything is okay and knows when to leave you alone. I wondered whether this is just a Brooklyn thing and if it is, I might find myself in the area more often. Aurora was a very cozy place for us to eat dinner one cold, Saturday night. Five of us shared two bottles of wine; one light and sweet and the other, heavier, courtesy of our waiter who gladly suggested them even though they weren't the most expensive bottles on the list. The octopus was warm with potatoes and capers. The veal tongue was done just right and not overpowering. I loved the bagna cauda, the Piedmont anchovy dip served in half a roasted red bell pepper; it went well with all the vegetables that came with it. The way pork belly should be I haven't had pork belly with skin that was evenly toasted and crispy. The meat was so tasty and not at all salty, which is easy to do with pork belly. The broccoli rabe and caramelized apple were side dishes with it. Beets are this season's trendy dessert The frisee, fennel and pear salad was a nice addition to our table. My truffle ice cream was perfect with the chocolate powder and sauce. It was a nice ending to a very comforting meal.

235 East 4th Street on Avenue B212/254.2900about $100 for two, with two drinks, without tip While the owners of The E.U. wait for their liquor license, they will do the B.Y.O.B. thing rather than delay the opening of their restaurant. On opening night, we were seated at the right time before they started turning people away at the door. The menu is a mix of small plates and sandwiches. They also have a raw bar and offer a few kinds of cheeses. It's an incredible space with glass panels they open to let the spring air in. Minus the frat boys who brought Bud Light in cans next to us, beautiful people flocked the other tables. We asked for our orders to be served as soon as each plate is ready. The duck egg with duck prosciutto was prepared like eggs Benedict and was more filling than I expected. The beef cheek was a favorite on our table, slowly stewed and reminded me Babbo's ravioli. Small portobellos were baked with goat cheese, an appetizer I can always appreciate even though I can easily make them at home for less money. Small pieces of taleggio, pecorino and manchego cheeses were served with sweet seedless grapes, a honeycomb and a small piece of fig cake. We also ordered a dozen of oysters and some crab claws and clams but when we asked our waiter to explain what periwinkles were, he told us that they were cured meat. Skeptical, I Googled the definition using my cell phone and found out that they are snails. Of course they're snails! They were listed under the raw bar section of the menu! To test him and see how he would correct himself, we added them to our order after the first of our plates were already served. He returned and sheepishly admitted that they are indeed snails; apologized and blamed his ignorance at opening night. (He should have known it's okay not to know something on the menu; just don't make up shit.) For dessert, we ordered the lemon crepe and the chocolate tart. Panna cotta was served instead of the chocolate tart and when we alerted another waiter, he took away the plate to correct it. A manager returned with it to our table, apologized and told us it was on the house while they prepare the chocolate tart. When our own waiter returned to ask if we're set for the night, we told him that we were waiting for our chocolate dessert because he made a mistake by serving us panna cotta. At this point, I think he was just so stressed out that he insisted panna cotta is the same as the tart. An egregious error but we took it easy on him and let it slide. Our bill charged us for the panna cotta but not for the chocolate tart and the plate of $15 charcuterie that never came. Not such a bad experience on opening night but I hope our waiter realizes that if he thought we were difficult, then he has a long way ahead of him. I'll give The E.U. a star for now but I expect to add another when I return and finally eat that chocolate tart. Update:Apparently, after we left at opening night, the cops came to stop the ruckus. A lower east side resident complained of the noise. The E.U. might not be doing B.Y.O.B. anymore so call before you go. Therefore, the one star stays.

462 Amsterdam Avenue & 82nd Street212/400.4036about $100 for two, with two drinks, without tip It was a slow Thursday night and we decided to step out for tapas. I loved the white anchovies with vinaigrette but why were they served on a bed of Romaine lettuce? The grilled sardines were more fishy than what I'm used to. They would have been better with some roasted julienned red bell peppers on the side. Staples like the Galician octopus, artichoke hearts and Spanish sausages were good but the pork tenderloin was boring and the leeks with a variety of mushrooms shouldn't have come with, well, the mushrooms. Beautiful lanterns The bars along Amsterdam Avenue in the upper west side are scenes from frat movies I've never seen. Even though our bill was a bit steep compared to other tapas bars in the city, it was a bit refreshing to sit inside Sol y Sombra and enjoy a glass of Tempranillo without bothering with boisterous young men.

Filipino Callos, Tripe Stew with Blood Sausage

***CONTENT
To make callos, the main ingredient, honeycomb tripe, was easy to find in Chinatown but I was visiting store to store to find blood sausages. There was no way my version of callos was going to have Vienna sausages from a can. (Honeycomb tripe is the reticulum, the first compartment in the cattle's stomach.) My trustworthy Spanish deli, Despaña, was closing for the day when I tried to buy them. The guy at the counter refused to sell them to me because the register closed five minutes before I got there. Talk about customer service. I ended up at Dean & Deluca but the packages on display were all expired. Dean & Deluca not carrying something I needed only meant one thing: I have to go to the Whole Foods at Union Square, the worst place to buy something like blood sausages. But I sucked it up and zigzagged my way through their awfully-designed space, past the beautiful people who don't appreciate produce as much as they fawn over the buffet and of course, received the expected responses from the clerks behind the counter: what is that?, blood what? and I don’t think we carry those. A stranger overheard me and, bless his heart, tipped me off to a smaller store on Sixth Avenue between 11th and 12th Streets. It was called Jefferson Market and I hit the jackpot with their blood sausages and Spanish chorizos. I spent a total of five hours roasting beef bones, simmering them and straining the juice into containers until I had proper beef stock. The next day, I scrubbed the fat off the honeycomb tripe and cleaned off a veal's foot before I boiled them together. The day after that, I finally got to work. Callos [kahl-yohs], or tripe in Spanish, is a famous dish from Madrid. Like other Spanish dishes, it comes with chorizo and tomatoes. Filipinos adapted the recipe, and after more than 350 years as a Spanish colony, we have made it our own. Ingredients: 1 pound honeycomb tripe, washed throughly and excess fat trimmed 1 foot of veal, cut in 2-inch pieces, washed and rubbed with salt 2 chorizo de Bilbao, cut into thin slices 2 blood sausages, cut into small pieces 2 cups of beef broth 2 garlics, 1 minced, another whole 2 onions, 1 roughly chopped, another whole peppercorns 1 bay leaf 2 tomatoes, diced half a bag of baby carrots 4 small potatoes, peeled, quartered 1 can of chickpeas, drained 1 can of sweet peas, drained 1 red bell pepper, julienned 2 red chili peppers 3 sprigs of rosemary lemon juice salt, pepper, olive oil 1. Cook tripe and veal's foot in a large pot and cover with water. Add whole garlic and onion, peppercorns and bay leaf. Bring to a boil; remove scum as it rises. Cover and simmer until tender, about 4 hours. 2. Transfer the cooked tripe to a plate and cool. Strain the stock and reserve 2 cups for later use. Cut the tripe into 1-inch strips. Discard veal's foot. 3. In a large Dutch oven, heat the olive oil and sauté the garlic, onions, tomatoes and chili peppers until fragrant. Add the chorizo and brown. Increase heat to high and add the tripe. Add the blood sausages and some of the beef broth. Season with salt and pepper. Bring to a boil, cover and simmer for 20 minutes. 4. Uncover the stew and add the potatoes with the rosemary and peppercorns. Add the last of the broth to keep the stew from drying up. Add the rest of the vegetables and cook until tender. Season with salt and pepper. Squeeze some lemon juice before serving. Related post/s: Offal in Filipino cooking Where to buy tripe, veal's foot, blood sausages and Spanish chorizo

Adapted from Anthony Bourdain's Poulet Roti Ingredients:1 whole chicken, about 4 pounds, washed throughly and patted dry, excess fat removed, giblets reservedhalf a lemon1 medium onion, halved1 sprig of thyme1 sprig of rosemarya handful of parsley, finely choppedhalf a stick of butter, sliced1 1/2 cups of white winesalt and pepper 1. Preheat the oven 375º. Season the inside cavity of the chicken with salt and pepper. Put the lemon, half of the onion, thyme and rosemary inside. Truss the chicken with twine, \"knees up, ass out.\" (Check out the Les Halles Cookbook for a really good explanation.) Insert a slice of butter underneath the skin so that a few lumps sit on the bird's breastbone. Season the outside with salt and pepper. (Try not to rip the skin.)2. On a roasting pan, put the giblets with the other half of the onion and 1 cup of the wine. Place the chicken on a rack and on the pan. Roast for 30 minutes while basting often.3. After 30 minutes, turn up the heat to 450º and cook for another 25 minutes. Poke the fat part of the thigh to see if the liquid that runs out is clear which means your bird is cooked. Remove the chicken from the oven and allow to rest on a chopping board for 15 minutes before carving.4. Meanwhile, place the pan on the stove over high heat. Stir in remaining white wine and scrape the bottom to collect the fond. Bring the wine to a boil and cook until it is reduced by half. Discard the giblets and the onion and whisk in remaining butter. Stir in parsley and season with salt and pepper. Serve with chicken slices.

They're delicious as appetizers while you wait for a table at Sobaya but they're also a good alternative to sreet hot dogs when you're out drinking.

I was once shushed by the temperamental sandwich maker while I stood in line for a $9 Geppeto (sopressata, caponata of eggplant, arugula in focaccia bread) so it's now refreshing to have someone behind the counter smile even if you mispronounce the Italian sandwich names. Sopressata and arugula in focaccia It's easy to assemble a prosciutto, mozarella and artichoke sandwich, making it hard to justify the $10 price (plus, you pay 50 cents to a $1.50 depending on the bread you choose) but everything just tastes better when you don't have to lift a finger to eat a delicious sandwich.

With Nagomi closer than Marumi across Houston Street, I can now enjoy fairly-priced fresh fish without shelling out more than $40 for ten pieces of sushi and a bottle of Sapporo. I've eaten twice since they've opened and the uni has been consistently good. The scallop might not be as buttery as Morimoto's but for $4 a piece, one can't complain. Have I mentioned that they're around the corner from The Room?

Czech Republic is landlocked right at the heart of continental Europe. It is surrounded by Austria, Germany and Poland, which is why the traditional food consists of a lot of meat and sauces. The most common meat is vepřové, or pork, and it is always served with knedlíky, or what they call dumplings, to soak up the gravy. All dishes almost always come with zelí or sauerkraut. Meats are often roasted or baked. We were lucky enough to enjoy a plate of rožněné selátko, or grilled piglet. Thankfully, it came with a serving of vegetable salad. When we were hungry-which was more often than you can ever imagine-we ordered the combo plate of pork, špekové or duck, and sausages. For a more homey meal, meat is stewed for hours to make goulash. We tasted a delicious one in thick sauce that used dark ale. Game is usually served on special occasions. We had rabbit in sauce flavored with thyme and ostrich meat served with pasta. The rabbit was nice, but the ostrich just tasted like tough beef. We even had baby octopus carpaccio served with arugula greens and drizzled with olive oil and lemon juice. We rarely had dessert but we spoiled ourselves with strudels and other pastries for breakfast or as snacks during the day. Now all that food needs to go down, and if the Czechs are known for anything, it's the way they appreciate their pivo, their beer. Pilsner, the most famous Czech beer, originated in Bohemia, a region in central Europe which occupies the western and middle thirds of Czech Republic. Pilsner was first brewed in a town called Plzeň and the same brewery that developed it still makes Plzňské or what we know as Pilsner Urquell. Another famous Czech beer is České Budějovice or Budweiser Budvar. Budvar and Anheuser-Busch are still engaged in numerous trademark lawsuits around the world. Each pub is supplied by only one brewery, or pivovar, but different types are usually available. No Czech beer lover ever drinks it canned as it is usually made for export. (Something I learned in Ireland and their Guinness.) Together with Plzňské from Plzeň comes Gambrinus. Prague has its own, Staropramen, and there is also Krušovice Light from Královský. All of the above are light and golden in color; foamy and refreshing at the end. I liked them fine, but my favorites were the dark lagers, Velkopopovický Kozel and U Fleků's own tmavé brew. If you can't make up your mind, there is a combination of light and dark called Rezane, also from Velkopopovický. If you want the more familiar, of course there's always the Belgian Stella. When you enter a pub, you're given a small piece of paper so that the waiter can tally your order. It's a given that you're going to drink beer, no matter what time it is. Beer will just keep coming to your table until you say something to your server otherwise. We drank nine different kinds of beers each in three days! Not to mention the multiple quantities we drank of each kind. Just thinking of that feat deserves another beer!

The sun was out our last day in Prague. We took the tram to Old Town and walked a bit to get to the square. The tourists were already gathered in front of the astronomical clock, so we joined them and sat at one of the outdoor chairs of U Orloje for morning coffee. We just missed the 11:00 strike so we decided to walk around the neighborhood and catch the clock \"show\" later. We found Odkolek Bakery on Rytirska street where we bought a couple of turnover pastries to eat. The Havel market was already set up. We walked around and checked out the souvenirs and fresh produce for sale. I bought the mandatory magnet for Anna and the Pilsner Urquell bottle opener for myself. We hurried back to the square just in time for the clock to strike the hour. The skeleton to the right tipped the hourglass and pulled a rope. The windows above the clock then opened and the twelve apostles did their procession thing. The other figures, Greed, Vanity and a Turk, all moved after the cock crowed. The astronomical clock imitates the orbit of the sun and the moon about the Earth as well as show the visible parts of the sky in the summer and winter months. All that information and we still had to look at the more normal-looking clock at the top of the tower to tell time! We were glad to have seen it. We felt like it was one of those things that made a Prague visit complete. We deserved a beer after standing under the sun to watch the clock. Cameron wanted to go to U Dvou Koĉek, which means Two Cats, to eat in honor of the two cats she left at home. We ate brewery cheese with paprika, black pepper sausage, ghoulash with bacon dumplings and a roasted pig's neck. Henners and Sam would have been proud. We washed all the food down with Pilsner Urquell. We spent the rest of the afternoon walking around the Jewish Quarter. The neighborhood went through an Art Nouveau revival and the buildings all looked new and beautiful. We walked by several synagogues before we paid to enter the Old Jewish Cemetery. Because it was the only area permitted to Jews back in the day, people had to be buried on top of each other, up to twelve layers deep. There are apparently twelve thousand gravestones crammed in there but over one hundred thousand are actually buried! It was definitely more crowded than a New York City subway. Back in Old Town, it was Cameron time. We bought tickets to see Mozart's Don Giovanni performed by marionettes. I wouldn't have thought about watching a bunch of wooden toys move while singing arias, but the marionette shows have a long tradition throughout Czech Republic. I'll have nightmares about moving toys now, but it was fun to watch and I would so recommend it if you're visiting. Before the sun set, we walked around Old Town Square some more to buy stuff to bring back to the States. We found La Vinotheque where we bought several bottles of Czech reds. We stopped by the Franz Kafka bookstore to add to my Catcher in the Rye translations collection. When we finally made it to Charles Bridge, the sky was beautifully painted with orange and purple and the Vltava River was calm. We couldn't help but take photos even though it was the most clichéd setting ever. Of course, that deserved a beer. We tried the Budvar at a pub off the Little Quarter, the real Budweiser before Anheuser-Busch stole the name. (The two companies have been duking it out in court for hundreds of years.) For our last dinner in Prague, we splurged at U Tří Pštrosů, or At The Three Ostriches, where we shared the game consommé, the foie gras, the coquille and the veal terrine with the ostrich steaks. Our last couple of hours in Prague were spent inhaling everything. We had to be at the airport at 5:30am the next day to catch our flight to Heathrow before heading back to New York City. We took in all the lights, the bricks, the buildings and the streets and said Děkuji, Praha!

We woke up fairly early the next morning even though we've only had a few hours of sleep. It was our first full day in Prague and we wanted to hit a lot of the spots on our list. Our hotel was right next to a highway but we were surprised we didn't hear the cars driving by throughout the night. We bought coffee at the Illy shop in front of the tram stop and decided that we have to head towards the Prague Castle in order to eat a decent breakfast because most of the restaurants in our area were still closed. Up on one of the hills towards the Castle, we stopped by Restaurant V Podhradí for ham and eggs, as well as an omelet with our second cup of coffee. It started to rain and continued to during our entire time at the Castle. We paid for ticket B to be able to get in St. Vitus's Cathedral, the Daliborka prison tower and walk along Golden Lane. There was much pushing and shoving to get inside the church. It must have been below zero in there, colder than it was outside. After a couple of hours, we took the tram to Lví dvůr, a restaurant I wrote down after reading about their specialty: roasted pig. We started with the baby octopus carpaccio before we ordered the piglet. We washed everything down with Krusonice beer. It was probably our simplest and yet best meal in Prague. The rain let up a bit and we walked up Petrin Hill along the Hunger Wall to get a glimpse of the ugly Observation Tower, Prague's mini version of the Eiffel. We reached the Strahov Monastery and paid the ridiculous 800 kronos fee to see the two libraries, Philosophical and Theological Halls. They asked us for an extra 50 kronos to take photographs, but I refused. They can keep their pretty libraries to themselves. Down the hill and in between taking photos of Czech rooftops, we stopped by the Josef Sudek photo gallery, named after a famous Czech photographer, and checked out the Pavel Hrdliĉka photographs on display. On our way home, we saw a photo of Švejk from the book I'm reading outside a bar and decided to get off the tram for a beer. It turned out to be U Švejků and one of the pubs the writer Jaroslav Hašek frequented. We ran back to our hotel, changed to drier clothes and took the tram right back out again to make it to the State Opera. We were a few minutes late, so they sat us along the side box seats. During intermission, we were seated in our correct seats where we got a really nice view of the show. Everything was in Italian and the supertitles were in Czech, so our discussion of the opera afterwards went something like: So the sideburns guy was angry at the good looking soldier? But the purple sash dude was his friend, right? No, the purple sash guy is the sideburns guy! We got the gist of it though, because the lady killed herself after the fatty died. What's an opera without the main characters dying in the end? Finding dinner was a challenge after 10:30pm. We refused to eat spaghetti in a pub or at any of the fast foods shacks around the more touristy area of Wenceslas Square. We even found a restaurant with a caveman theme-we just couldn't get ourselves to do it. Restaurant Boheme to the rescue. There was a lonely man playing the piano in the middle of the room. He would have been delightful if only we weren't seated next to an American tourist who looked like Michael Bolton with a fanny pack. He kept looking at us to strike up a conversation and he slurped his wine to give us an inkling that he knew how to \"taste\" wine. It was probably the fastest meal we've ever had in our lives. We scarfed down a plate of ghoulash in dark beer and roasted rabbit to avoid any more eye contact with him. At least he gave us a story to laugh about. Back in Smichov, we found Jet Set, a techno-theme bar in front of where they were playing the movies for the Febio Fest. We had a Stella nightcap, the only beer they had on tap. People were coming out of the theaters across the way. It was too bad that there weren't anymore hotdog stands around. We went back to our hotel, passed out and waited for our last full day in Prague. Related post/s: Day 1: Three Kinds of Beer, First Few Hours in Prague

After a beer with our artichoke chicken salad from Snack at the airport bar, Cameron and I boarded our flight to Prague. We watched Pride and Prejudice on the plane instead of getting much-needed sleep (it was good but no one beats Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy) that by the time we reached Zurich to transfer, we were too tired to appreciate the fact that we were in Switzerland. A small sandwich tied us over until we landed in Prague. Outside the Ruzyně airport, we waited for the #100 bus which connected to the yellow metro near our Ibis hotel in Smichov. It felt good to get some fresh air that we didn't mind the wait. We initially planned to catch the #119 but realized that we didn't have to go to the city center to take the yellow. At the Andel station, we were welcomed by a crowd of Czechs milling around the shopping mall and waiting for the tram. We asked a lady inside one of the cosmetic stores to direct us to our hotel. She pointed to the sign down the block and we finally checked in. Our hotel was just right. It wasn't anything special, but it was so clean that we didn't mind the two exact towels provided for us everyday. We settled in for a few minutes and decided to start our first day in Prague by taking care of business: buy opera tickets for the next day's show. We took the yellow line to Muztek, transfered to the green and got off at Muzeum. We jaywalked to get to the other side of the highway off Wenceslas Square and bought tickets for Verdi's Les Vêpres Siciliennes before the box office closed. With that taken care of, our second order of business was to get our first meal and first pint. We walked down the path of the National Museum and found Café Svatého Vaclava right before it started to drizzle. Our first Kozel beer was priceless. We also ordered the potato soup and a big plate of pork and duck meat plus sausages served with red and white cabbage. It was already dark when we finished so we decided to walk to U Fleků and experience the traditional Czech pub feel. U Fleků is one of Prague's oldest pubs and will remain to be one of my favorite pubs while in the country. We sat down with strangers on a long wooden table, listened to the two musicians playing the accordion and the tuba while we inhaled everyone's smoke and tried to get any of the waiters' attention. The European tourists in front of us helped us order two pints. We finally got a piece of paper which allowed us to reorder every time one of the servers walked by with a tray of dark beer. A line is marked on our paper every time we nod for a refill. Another waiter also carried a tray of Becherovka shots. Cameron wondered, What do you think those are? I didn't know, so I signaled for the waiter to give us two. It had a cinnamon-y taste to it. We had another beer before we stepped out to walk around Little Quarter and to Charles Bridge, the most popular bridge in Prague. We joined throngs of people walking in the dark and crossing over to the Old Town side. We bought a hot dog from the corner store. When we reached Old Town, we noticed a small alley under the bridge. We were so tired but decided to check out the pub anyway. We ended up at U Karlova Mostu for some moucnicky or dessert. We ordered the liskooriskova minibabovka s vanilkovou zmrzlihou v cokoladove kruste, also known as hazelnut cake with ice cream in chocolate crust. What better way to wash down a dessert with a bunch of consonants than with a mix of dark and light beer: Rezane. We walked to the #12 tram back to Andel and walked back to our hotel. Not even twenty-four hours in Czech Republic and we've experienced so much already. Three kinds of beer, at least.

88 Tenth Avenue between 15th and 16th Streets 212/989.8883 about $600 for four, with several drinks, with tip ♥ ♥ ♥ My first Morimoto experience in Philadelphia was unforgettable. Chef Masaharu Morimoto joined us at our table after dinner and started talking about the World Cup which was happening at the time. Four years later, soccer fans are getting ready for Germany and I was sitting yet again inside a Morimoto restaurant. I was able to score a table for four a month after its opening and I found three people willing to spend a lot of money to eat. Tyler opted for the sashimi combination which came on a tall, albeit silly, display of ice. Cameron went for the raw bar combination with amazing scallops and delicious lobster and crab claws. Lisa opted for the black cod miso, a dish perfected by Morimoto while he was still in Nobu. The waitstaff congratulated me at the end after I finished my nine-course omakase. Some of my favorites: a patterned maki with dashi foam, perhaps the trendiest way to making sauce after Ferran Adria of El Bulli near Barcelona put his stamp on the technique; yellowfin tuna and mackerel served with seaweed encased in gelee; a palate cleanser of sesame powder tea that came with the coolest brush stirrer. The service was attentive but we had a different waiter for each course. I couldn't blame one of them when he couldn't tell me that one of my sushi pieces was actually needlefish. (Is the east coast running out of bounty that they have to turn to needlefish?) Another missed the lychee seeds which came with one of my courses but he was nice enough to return and tell me when I expressed my curiosity. When we were heading out of the Tadao Ando-designed space, chef Morimoto was talking to a friend by coat check. I stood right next to him while Tyler took a photograph and I quickly told him that I'm a big fan. Typical chef-fucker, I know, but I walked away with a signed copy of the menu. After five years in Philly, Morimoto has staged a very nice comeback.

34 Cooper Square off 6th Street and Lafayette 212/475.2989 about $60 for two, with two drinks, without tip ♥ I'll group Gyu-Kaku under my Korean and Japanese restaurants list because they had both Korean-style barbecues and Japanese yakitoris. They had several kinds of soups served in clay pots that tasted like Korean chigaes, but udon or ramen noodles were added. They also offered a nice-sized bowl of bibimbap but they had ahi tuna and shrimps we grilled on the tabletop stove ourselves. It's a spacious restaurant off the hubbub of St. Mark's Place. The attentive service is perfect for bigger groups, plus the happy hour price of drinks ($2.50 for Kirin beer on tap) and meat specials (50% off on filet mignon meat to grill) are hard to say no to.

We rented an apartment on 78 rue St-Louis-en-l'Ile via Paristay.com, so most of the stops we made were around the island of Saint-Louis. It was the perfect space for three people complete with a loft bed, a bathroom, a fully-equipped kitchen and a sofa bed in the living room. The neighborhood in itself is one of the most coveted in Paris because residents are on their own island on the Seine River, away from the hoopla of the city but right by most necessities and all kinds of luxury. Thank you so much for traveling with me this past week!

We woke up earlier today to catch the 10am train to Versailles. My father wasn't feeling well so he opted to stay in and wait for us in the apartment. Not wanting to deal with drama our last full day in Paris, my mother and I left for the RER C train to Château de Versailles. The ride was less than forty minutes; the walk from the train station to the château was less than ten. We joined the queue for the \"A\" entrance and paid €8 each for individual passes to the Grand Apartments, the Hall of Mirrors and the Queen's Suite. And grand it was! The Château de Versailles is sumptuously gaudy, yet impressive. The frescoed ceilings, the Rococo woodwork and all the marble tell you how preciously the monarchy lived. They loved themselves, too, because there are murals and statues of Louis XIV and Marie-Antoinette everywhere. Our favorite was the exhibition of Louis-Nicolas van Blarenberghe's gouache paintings. He was a battlefield painter and he produced detailed accounts of what he saw during the wars. We used the magnifying glasses attached to the paintings to look at the details-obviously Flemish in style and skill-of his miniature soldiers, animals and weaponry. After walking inside the château, we braved the cold and visited the gardens, over 815 hectares in total. Trees and plants were pruned to shape and there are fountains at every turn and even more statues of gods and mermaids on every corner. Apparently, they all dance to classical music in the summer. We went to the cafe downstairs before we took the train back to Paris and ate a quick bite of horrible pizza and instant tea and coffee. We picked up my dad from the apartment and we started off again to Voltaire Boulevard to buy some wines to take home. Les Domaines qui Montent sells bottles of wine at the same rate as their producers. I walked in and told the super-friendly bearded guy to help me pick four bottles of French wines. He gave me a Bourdeaux, a Côtes du Rhone, a Burgundy and a Cabernet-Merlot blend. A couple of hours later, we went to Le Caveau de l'Ile for dinner to celebrate our last night in Paris. I was surprised that my father wanted the frog's legs (meron nyan sa Ilocos!) with the squid and my mom wanted the duck. I chose the lamb chops with the salmon tartare. Everything was delicious. We also ordered a bottle and a half of Côtes du Provence rosé-yes, I drank most of it-and black currants sorbet for dessert. We walked by the restaurant this afternoon and saw that the menu posted outside was in English and we figured it was \"safe.\" As expected, the waitress spoke English and was very accommodating to us and to the other Americans that came in after we did. We toasted to our week in Paris. I half-joked at how we will never go on vacation together again because my dad is so maarte. But if you put all the father drama aside, I have to admit that we all had a good time. I liked spending time with them; sharing a new city and at the same time getting lost with them. We all experienced something new and we were together as a family in a country we've never visited before. We wished kuya could have joined us but I think we had a good time because we wanted to show him that we're that kind of a family-the B family. Au revoir, Paris!

It didn't rain at all today but it was nippy enough to keep us awake and active all day. On our way out, we stopped at the boulangerie near the Seine to buy some fresh croissants. The bakery downstairs was closed. We took the #7 to Châtelet, transferred to the #4 and got off on Barbès-Rochechouart to transfer again to the #2 for the Anvers stop. Montmartre was the home of Picasso and other artists in its heyday, but today it is as busy as 34th Street in New York, full of stores selling everything from cheap trinkets to housewares. We climbed the hill to Sacré-Coeur and saw the view of the entire city-it's the highest point of all Paris. We realized once we got to the top that if we're not walking, we're climbing up steps during this vacation. The basilica looks like it's from the Byzantine times, but it was actually built later in 1876 to atone for the sins of the French during the revolution. They were being killed by the Prussians so donations from all over the country poured in to build a church and strike a deal with God. It's a pretty funny story if you think about it. It's so French. My dad did the Filipino thing: he bought a small statue of the Sacred-Heart to atone for his own sins. From the north of Paris, we took the #4 all the way south, to the Montparnasse Tower. If Montmartre was the home of successful artists, Montparnasse was where the opposite end of the economic, social and political spectrum strived. Artists from all over the world came here to take advantage of the cheap rent. It was like the Brooklyn version of SoHo; well, before the hipsters moved to Brooklyn and made it expensive, too. We walked to the Cimetière de Montparnasse and checked out the, well, dead scene. My dad didn't like being there and he was opposed to my taking of photographs of the graves, so as soon as we entered, we walked towards the exit. At Denfert-Rochereau, we took the #4 to Place d'Italie and transfered to the #7 towards Chinatown on Porte de Choisy. Paris' Chinatown is like Vermont's-it's not there. There was construction on the main boulevard and the cranes were all in the way. If I didn't see the Chinese McDonald's, I would have walked back to the train and given up. But we ended up having lunch at Thai-Vien where we shared some Laotian sausages, grilled pork chops and tom yang kung, a shrimp hot soup that I like to eat in lieu of phở because of the lemongrass. From Chinatown, we took the #7 back up to transfer to the #5 and to Bastille just to take a photo of the tower. And here it is: There's really nothing to say except for the fact that the Spirit of Liberty is on top, erected to commemorate the 1830 July revolution when \"Citizen King\" Louis-Philippe replaced the autocracy of Charles X. From there, we made one final stop at Les Halles, Paris' main food market until it was replaced by an ugly shopping complex. (And also the namesake of the New York City bistro where Anthony Bourdain used to work.) It used to smell like produce, now it just smells like pee. What's interesting is that you can still see the remains of what Émile Zola called le ventre de Paris, the stomach of Paris, even though it is now referred to as le trou des Halles or the a-hole of Les Halles. (I wanted to go to Rungis, where the market is located today but waking up before 7am has been very difficult. Perhaps when I return.) Back on St-Louis-en-l'Ile, I finally managed to buy ice cream from the famous Berthillon shop before it closed for the day. They're famous for their all-natural ice cream, and oh-man, I don't think I've ever tasted better pistachio and apricot flavors in my life! I went up the apartment to save some for my parents who went straight to the supermarket from Les Halles. I ran back downstairs to catch the prettiest store on St-Louis-en-l'Ile, La Petite Scierie, before it closed and spent a fortune on foie gras and duck meat. If you're in Paris but you don't like foie gras, visit the store anyway and check out the good looking Frenchie at the counter who gave me a taste of the Loire wine they carry with the foie gras I bought. Mr. and Mrs. B made it back without my help and we spent the rest of the night chillin' with red wine, ice cream and foie gras on fresh baguette. Life is so good in Paris.

It was raining when we woke up this morning. While eating my fresh croissant with a glass of cold milk, I poured over our Paris map to see where we can go when it's gloomy outside. The boy suggested we visit Musée d'Orsay before we left. I was willing to skip it, but he told us that we should go anyway just to see the space. It's open on Tuesdays while the Louvre isn't, so naturally, every tourist in the city had the same idea. We stood in line for about an hour with our new umbrellas. It felt so good to finally get in and warm our feet. Seeing this as soon as we walked in was just incredible: What used to be a train station until the modern trains proved that the platforms were too short, Musée d'Orsay is now the home of Van Gogh, Monet, Manet, Degas, Renoir, Cézanne and Gauguin. There's also a nice collection of Art Nouveau furniture in several of the floors. After the museum, it was defeat: we ate at a Chinese deli for lunch. I wanted to walk to Boulevard Raspail to find a place to eat lunch, but Dynasty King called my father's name on the way there. He ate like he had never eaten before, the rice making him happier than a pig in mud. Maybe it was the beef with onions or the sautéed vegetables, but I sat and ate with them; maybe it was my dad looking like he's finally full. Or maybe I'm just a good daughter. From Musée d'Orsay, we crossed Pont Solferino to the Jardin des Tuileries which was bare and quiet because of the rain. We walked to the carousel and crossed the street to the Obélisque, a gift from the viceroy of Egypt on the Place de la Concorde. I made a stop at a creperie and bought one filled with strawberries and ordered a cup of hot chocolate with it. We walked and walked until we reached the Arc de Triomphe, something I've always wanted to see ever since I moved to New York City and saw Washington Square Park's tinier version. I remember reading somewhere that when you finally see it, you'd feel like you're in another place; that beyond the arc is a different world, sort of like an opening to something new. The walk on Champs Élysées was long, so we made a few stops along the way, specifically at Lacoste, my dad's favorite store. It took €8 each, around 284 steps and some heavy breathing to finally get up the arc, but the view was as rewarding as I expected. It was a bit cloudy from up there but to see the city's traffic moving away from the arc and Georges Haussmann's twelve avenues forming like the sun's rays were pretty cool. Talk about city planning and practical architecture. The arc was built as a monument to the triumph of Napoleon's armies but today, it's just known as a symbol of the sheer triomphe of being French. Parisians gathered here when they were liberated from German occupation and they partied here when they won the '98 World Cup. Every year, they still use it as the point of celebrating Bastille Day, the end of the monarchy in France. From the gift shop, my mom and I bought each other tiny silver pendants of the Eiffel and the Arc as remembrance from this trip. We picked up a few items from a grocery store on rue Saint-Antoine on our way home. My feet were so cold I decided to cook dinner and stay in for the night. To find our way back, I remembered Arabella's tip: stay close to the river and you'll never get lost. I peeked from one corner and another to look for the water and then we walked to St-Louis-en-l'Ile. I stopped by La Ferme Saint-Aubin to buy a bottle of Bordeaux. I also bought several jars of jam from L'Epicerie for tomorrow's breakfast before going upstairs. Dinner was fennel-flavored chicken soup with rice and spinach. I started with a can of Leffe while cooking and finished with a glass of the red wine. We ended the night by doing laundry and figuring out what the French on the washing machine meant. Thanks to Babel Fish, we learned that marche means go and arret is to stop. It's not so bad when it rains in Paris.

Our hyacinths are still alive and so is the B family! We hit two big spots today: Musée du Louvre and the Eiffel Tower. We woke up a little earlier so we were able to eat a fresh baguette and drink hot mint tea before we stepped out. We crossed rue des Deux Ponts to the #7 and took it all the way to the museum where the line wasn't terribly long before noon. For some reason, we couldn't enter the Denon section straight to La Joconde, Mona Lisa, so we had to go around to find it. Could there be any more Japanese tourists in the Louvre? They came in droves, each following a leader holding up a stick with a flag. When we finally made it to the Italian paintings, the famous and familiar painting was just right there encased in bulletproof glass. She hogged the limelight and it was unfortunate that other people just walked by the other famous da Vincis outside the room. We took slow strolls by Jacques-Louis David's Consecration of the Emperor Napoleon and Véronèse's Wedding Feast at Cana. Then the museum's alarm went off and we listened to the evacuation announcement in several different languages until we couldn't take it anymore. An oncoming headache made me skip the two Vermeers, but we just wanted to find the exit and get the hell out. My camera's battery ran out so we decided to go home, recharge it and eat lunch before continuing on with our sunny day. Back on St-Louis-en-l'Ile, we ordered duck confit, steak with fries and penne with gorgonzola at Cafe Med. The duck meat fell off its bones and was perfect with a warm baguette. And how can I say no to stinky gorgonzola cheese melted on al dente pasta? I finished with a cappuccino but controlled myself from buying a crepe to go. Fortified and armed with a newly-charged camera, we walked towards the Palais de Justice and took the RER C to Champs de Mars. The tower was right there as soon as we stepped out of the Metro station. We spent a total of three hours standing in line to take the elevator to the top floor (€11 each), taking photos and again standing in line to exit. Within that time frame, the temperature dropped drastically and I could barely feel my toes when my mom finally took a photo of me. It was a different feeling finally seeing the Tour Eiffel; much more exhilarating than being on the top of the Empire State Building (sorry) or the Statue of Liberty (so sorry!). Mona Lisa had no say. When you're standing right below it and you look up, nothing beats that realization of how massive it really is. All the waiting was worth it. My mom thanked me-I don't know exactly if it was because she was feeling the same way or if she was thanking me for the entire trip-but all I could do was smile back. Before going back up the apartment, I bought an apricot crepe and a Hoegaarden to snack on before dinner. A few hours later, I woke my parents from their nap to eat. I saw a Moroccan restaurant down the street earlier and I was hoping it would be open even though most Parisian restaurants are closed on Mondays. Le Tarbouche was open. I've made tagine at home before but my parents don't know the difference between Moroccan and all the curries that I cook. I ordered two tagines: lamb with raisins and onions and chicken with preserved lemon and olives. I also ordered several dips of eggplant, red bell peppers with tomatoes and cucumber with onions to accompany ksra, the Moroccan nan. Everything came with vegetarian couscous and a 2000 bottle of Algerian wine from Chateau Tellagh. I think the three of us had to adjust our waistbands after eating. All that giggling, waiting and walking made us super hungry and tired. The waiter and I communicated just by nodding our heads and doing hand signals. It's always easier when food is involved, no?

We woke up at 11am after a long slumber. Even my parents who are early risers were surprised they slept soundly. As soon as we all got ready, we bought our first croissants from the bakery downstairs. The boy was right; croissants in France are flakier than American ones. Then I bought a cup of real hot chocolate across the street at Cacao et Chocolat. It was drizzling but we were adamant to start our walk around Saint Germain and the Latin Quarter. On Saint-Germain Boulevard, we stopped by the St. Nicolas church on rue de Pontoise to dry up and get our bearings. Not knowing how to read a map even if I'm stuck in a big city, we kept trudging on toward rue des Écoles until we finally saw a sign that said Panthéon. We walked up rue des Carmes and voila! We paid our €7-admissions-at $1 = €1.42 rate!-and spent a couple of hours checking out Louis XV's thank you gift to Sainte-Geneviève, the patron saint of Paris, and visiting the tombs of France's most influential figures. My mom was most impressed with the naves and the dome, while my dad, as expected, mentioned that there's a \"similar\" building in Ilocos Sur. I rolled my eyes at my mom and she gave me that knowing smile. Down at the crypt, Voltaire, Hugo and Dumas-Marie Curie as the only woman-are among those buried. I was hungry when we stepped back out in the rain. We walked down the hill and decided to have lunch at La Paillote D'or, a restaurant that \"spécialités Vietnamiennes.\" If my French serves me right, why, I believe that means they got phở inside! I struggled when I ordered, but I managed to get my parents beef saté (boeuf) and grilled pork (porc grillé) and myself a bowl of phở with papaya salad (salade de papaye). My very faint deux bols de riz, s'il vous plaît got my dad two bowls of rice. (My mom squealed, You're so cute!) I know that chicken is poulet but goddamn it, I'm not having boring chicken in France! The rain let up, so we continued on without really being sure where we were headed, but when I noticed the sign for the Sorbonne, we cut through, said a quick hello and took a photo. Jardin du Luxembourg was unmistakable on Saint-Michel Boulevard. It was so beautiful even without leaves on the trees. The Palais du Luxembourg, the seat of the French senate, was grand and it was a nice backdrop to the Fontaine de Médicis and its surrounding statues. Next stop was the church of St-Sulpice, most famous for its Delacroix frescoes. I've gone into more churches the last day and half than I have in the past year! My dad bought another candle and lit it in front of the Pietà. We spent the last light walking back home. The rain was steadier, so we admitted it was time to give our feet some rest. A couple of hours later, we went to Aux Anysetiers du Roy to eat dinner. I encouraged my parents to be more adventurous. We ordered and shared the salade de gésiers and the half dozen escargots with the sôle meuniere and the fricasée de volailles. We also bought milk, butter, tea and beer from the store across our apartment with the friendly Moroccan clerks. My mom stopped by the bakery by herself and bought a baguette by showing the clerk the universal symbol for \"one\" and uttering \"bread.\" I think we're getting the hang of Paris.

The three Filipinos made it to Paris! Our flight left for Iceland at around 9pm. Five hours later as the sun was rising in Reykjavik, we had our passports stamped through customs. We boarded the flight to Charles de Gaulle and finally got some much-needed sleep. We arrived in Paris a little after noon. My parents waited for an hour to pick up the wheelie we were required to check in at JFK while I changed some dollars to a whopping €1.31 rate! From there, the adventure began. The Cia plan had us take the lift back down to the departures area where we got on the shuttle bus to the RER B which in turn connected us to the city's Metro. I bought three Visite cards, the equivalent of New York's unlimited Metrocard, but wasn't informed that I can only begin using them on Monday until those damn turnstiles showed us Xs on the small screens. I stood back in line and bought three €8 tickets to Châtelet-Les Halles, the grand mama of all Metro stops. We walked and walked to follow the signs to the Mairie d'Ivry #7, got on and stepped out at the next stop, Pont Marie. The Seine was right there and we all let out a sigh of relief. We crossed the bridge to Île Saint-Louis and walked a few more blocks to the apartment. Of course, the Cia plan is never fool-proof; I forgot to write down the agent's cell phone number and there were no pay phones around to call the owner. I asked two hotel employees and the grocery store clerk across the street but they all said I had to get out of the island to find a pay phone. My last course was the man carrying a paper bag full of baguettes. He lent me his cell phone and I finally talked to the apartment owner. Someone was watching over us because the owner was actually inside the apartment to let us in and as soon as we did, the agent showed up. The apartment was as beautiful in person as in the photographs. The subtle steel green color was a nice choice to match the loft, the wooden beams and the fully-equipped kitchen. From the drapes and the sofa down to the towels, the owners made sure everything complemented. The windows looked over the small street of rue St-Louis-en-l'Ile and you can smell the baked goods from the boulangerie below us. We settled in after taking care of all the paperwork with the agent-hot shower never felt so good. We stepped out and started walking towards Notre Dame on Île de la Cité until we decided to grab something quick at Le St-Regis Brasserie. Good timing, too, because it started to rain while we were eating our hot onion soups and saucissons. The cathedral's bells beckoned and we decided to end our first afternoon by giving thanks. We sat through an hour of mass conducted in French and spotted fellow Filipinos in the crowd. (Either they turned around whenever we said something in Tagalog or the women wore scrunchies.) It was dark when we left and a bit nippy, too. The crowd was still steadily coming in and out of the church, though. The bistros around the corner were opening up while the souveneir stands were closing shop. We walked back to the apartment, bought beautiful flowers from Patrick Allain Fleuriste and figured out how the TV worked until dinner time. Around 10pm, we walked down the street to eat at La Taverne Du Sergent Recreteur because Gourmet De l'Ile could not accommodate any more diners in their tight space. I knew my parents would not eat as much as I would like them to so we opted out of the €39 prix fixe that comes with endless sausages and salads and a bottle of Alsatian wine. I ordered the lamb while my mom went for the steak and my dad the salmon. My lamb was perfect but my mom could not chew her beef. My dad could not complain that his salmon came with rice. We toasted to our first night in Paris with a Heineken and two glasses of Rhône. We made it, we said, and then we laughed our Filipino laugh. Related post/s: Planning a trip to Paris

They didn't start letting women in until the 70s but it's been around since 1857. People who go to McSorley's know they only have two choices of beer-McSorley's Light and McSorley's Dark-and they are served in pairs because their mugs are a wee bit smaller than a pint. $8 for four mugs is a good way to start your night with their burger and fries. You should still try to avoid peeking inside the men's bathroom unless you want to see someone using the urinal and don't expect the waiters to chat; they're only there to ask you \"Light or dark?\"

It's dingy, smoke-filled and smoke-stained but their grilled skewers, yakitori, are still the best on St. Mark's Place. I love coming here for a late night dinner and ordering the beef tongue, beef stomach and the smelt yakitoris with a bottle of beer to wash all of them down. During winter visits, I go for the ramen or the tofu and udon soup bowl. Whichever time you choose to visit, expect to wait. The place hasn't changed much since I was in high school. The cool Japanese kids who used to come here have just been replaced by other cool Japanese kids.

Add the chickpeas, zucchini and raisins, bring to a boil, and cook, uncovered, until the vegetables are tender and the liquid thickens, about 5 minutes more. Season the curry with salt and pepper, to taste, and cilantro.

119 Sullivan Street between Prince and Spring212/343-0404about $125 for two, with two drinks, without tip Every time I go to Blue Ribbon Sushi, I'm always surprised at how low the sushi prices are. For Japanese sushi (listen up, Tomoe fans!) the choices are always fresh and of high quality. Their uni, fluke, yellowtail and toro, whether sushi or sashimi, are consistently buttery. The ankimono, monkfish liver, is also a favorite of mine. I like their tatakis and I alternately order from tuna belly to salmon to yellowtail tartare when I visit.

253 West 11th Street corner of West 4th212/229-2611$120 for three, BYOB, with tip I find it hard to pay for grilled portobello mushrooms with goat cheese or for a bowl of endives and beets but Tartine lets you bring your own wine without a cork fee so I willingly shell out my $8 for each dish. Heck, I even shell out $40 to pay for my share of a $120-dinner which consisted of two bowls of mussels, five snails, grilled salmon, a baked artichoke! Some of my favorite dishes include: salad Basquaise with roasted red bell peppers and eggplants with basil and arugula, garlic saucisson in shallots and chives dressing and roasted pears sprinkled with prosciutto. But Tartine is so much better during the fall when produce is more than acceptable in New York City. If you can spare 45 minutes and wait for a table outside, brunch on a Saturday morning is superb. No matter when you go, save room for dessert. Their tarte tatin and chocolate meringue with ganache are delicious with that bottle of wine you've been saving.

237 Grand Street on Bowery212/431.0998about $50 for two, without drinks, without tip We wanted to stay away from Canal Street to celebrate Chinese New Year and Jase suggested that we do hot pot instead of dim sum. Who am I to say no to soup even at 11am? For about $20, one person can have his own hot pot of either vegetables, seafood, beef or both seafood and beef (\"surf n' turf\") in his choice of broth. The fee includes a bubble tea under $2.75 and a few dollars for gratuity. It's a lot of food for one person and I prefer the Shabu Tatsu way of sharing one big pot, family style but when it's cheap, you can't help but eat.

The Chinese man and I understood each other with just hand signals. I waved my hand against my throat to ask for the head to be chopped off. I shook my hands so that he would understand that the legs also have to go. I had no clue what the gray chicken was in the store until another customer told me it was Silkie chicken. Do I cook it like regular chicken? I asked. Yes, she said, but it's silkier inside; that's why it's expensive. When my mother saw it this morning, she recognized it as the manok ng Intsik, Chinese chicken. They're poofy and they look like they wear pajamas. She said that one of my grandfathers, the Chinese one from her cousin's side, used to cook the black chickens all the time. Do I cook it like regular chicken? I asked. Yes, she also said, but the meat is moist and it doesn't dry up like normal chicken. Oh, that's what the man meant by sirr-kee. I Googled it and sure enough, they are from Asia and they are white and poofy. Pajamas aside, Silkies are a rare breed because they have black skin and bones and their feathers look like hair. They are also able to sit (how cuuuute!) and they have five toes (aaaaw!). Because they're docile, they make good pets. Mario Batali had a recipe using game hen. After being convinced that Silkie is just like regular chicken, I went to the grocery store to buy sage, pomegranate and a bottle of Marsala. Never have I needed only three ingredients that took two hours to accumulate. It was almost 2pm when I got back home. I ate some prosciutto and baguette for lunch in between soaking the pomegranate seeds and preheating the oven. The recipe was so easy to follow, it took less than an hour to cook. Too easy in fact, that I was skeptical it was going to taste good. I should never doubt my ability to cook because this turned out to be delicious and, well, sirr-kee. Ingredients: 1 Silkie chicken, rinsed and patted dry seeds of large pomegranate 1 cup Marsala 12 sage leaves zest of an orange 1 stick of butter salt, pepper and olive oil 1. In a small bowl, cover the pomegranate seeds with the Marsala. Set aside, covered, for 1 hour. 2. Preheat oven to 375º. Season the chicken inside-out with salt and pepper. 3. Drain the pomegranate seeds and reserve some of the liquid. Stuff the birds with half of the seeds. Tie chicken legs together with kitchen twine. 4. In a large ovenproof sauté pan, heat some butter with the olive oil over high heat. Add 3 sage leaves and cook for 1 minute. Add the chicken and brown on all sides, about 5 minutes. Lower the heat to medium and add the remaining 9 sage leaves and the rest of the pomegranate seeds. 5. Tranfer the pan to the oven and roast for 10 minutes. Remove the pan from the oven and drizzle 3 tbsps of the reserved Marsala liquid. Dot the chicken with some more butter and baste with the pan juices. Roast for another 15 minutes or until the juices run clear when a thigh is pierced. 6. Meanwhile, in a sauce pan, melt the remaining butter over low heat. Add the zest and cook for 5 minutes so that the zest absorbs the butter. Remove from heat. 7. Transfer the chicken to a serving dish. Sprinkle with the zest and drizzle pan juices with pomegranate seeds over it.

Nothing has changed except that maybe Leonardo's posse doesn't stop by anymore. Their black cod with miso is still very delicious and their yellowtail tartar with caviar still kick my sinuses. Their sushi and sashimi are still worth holding for-they still had four ladies answering the phones during lunch peak next to coat check-but with numerous sushi restaurants in New York City, you can skip Nobu especially if you're not using your boss' expense account. But if you're like me and you're still hungry after a $200-bill for four, the warm apple tart topped with ice cream and served with honey sesame sauce will make your eyes roll. The chocolate souffle cake with shiso syrup and green tea ice cream is also a great way to end your meal.

Last September, I did something I've always wanted to do for my parents: I bought them tickets to France. They've never traveled outside of their New York-Philippines route and Paris is one of those places a person has to go to at least once in their lifetime. (Others say that's Disneyland, but we can have a long discussion about that.) My parents have always wanted to go to Paris but they're not very adventurous in terms of traveling and spending. My mother just turned 58 and my father is 59 today. I can't think of a more perfect time to give them, and myself, a treat. There was an affordable non-stop flight via Air France to Charles de Gaulle, but I couldn't help but pick the flight with a stop over at Reykjavik. Our layover is only forty-five minutes each way, but for my own selfish reasons, I'm already thinking of how many vacuum-sealed fish I can buy, duty-free, at the Keflavik airport! Crazy, right? But you'd understand if you were also the type who'd spend $74 on cab fare to eat barbeque ribs from the Houston airport. My father is what Filipinos would call maarte. I can't think of a better English translation than \"coquete.\" When I first told my parents about going to Paris, my father did not even bat an eyelash. My mom squealed in delight (like mother, like daughter) but my father just pursed his lips, probably still figuring out where the hell Paris is in relation to Manila. My father is like your father. He is not mean, but tact has never been his strength (like father, like daughter). From when he refuses to taste anything I cook to saying that he doesn't really want to see Paris, it doesn't occur to him that how he reacts or what he says would hurt his daughter's feelings. My father is of the male species, after all. So the last few months, he has refused to read any books about France or look at the Paris map I've bought to get them oriented. My mom has been reading the guide books I gave her and she's been checking off tourist spots she wants to see in person. (In the movie Constant Gardener, one of the characters said, Adam was God's prototype; he got it right with Eve.) But my father has been saying things like I'll just take the next flight back to New York if I don't like it. He kept his mouth shut after I suggested that he might want to look at the metro map to get his aSs back to the airport without us. The other day, my mom told me to be nicer to my dad. That in fact behind closed doors, he has been asking my mom if I am making reservations at some fancy restaurants and if he needs to pack his suit. My mom reminded me that whenever we go anywhere together, even in the city, he's the first one to pose for a photograph. He's just being maarte, she said. So we're going to Paris and we're traveling as a family-sans my older brother-for the first time in our lives. I just want my parents to enjoy the trip and know that their daughter is thinking of them.

541 Amsterdam Avenue, corner of 86th Street212/724.4707about $40 for two, without drinks, without tip An institution more than just a trendy brunch place, Barney Greengrass serves the best smoked sturgeon in the city. The fish is perfect with scrambled eggs and onions even at $14 a pop. It's probably the only place I'd actually enjoy salmon and lox with potatoes and not cringe at the $44 bill for two at the end. (No worries, that includes coffee and orange juice plus toasted bagels and cream cheese.) If you like your caviar, this is the place to order them. They even deliver overnight to your house in the Hamptons, you know, if you actually have a home in the Hamptons. Matzo ball soup Cameron's salmon with eggs and onions They don't need your business at Barney Greengrass. They do well with just the upper west side residents lining up outside during the weekends. The service is too hasty but attentive in that New York City kind of way; don't expect to be buttered up here unless you're a regular or if your name is Richard Dreyfuss. (I only name him because I've seen him eat here during one of my visits.) The maître d' screams to get your attention when it's your turn to be seated but the food is too good-and the day is too early-to pay attention to such trivial matters.

70 West 71st Street between Columbus Avenue and Central Park West212/579.8751about $100 for two, with two drinks, without tip After a half bottle of Moillard, we just couldn't shake off the idea of lamb for dinner. Fortunately, Pasha was around the corner of the wine bar we were in. Even with the coat-check girl's attitude, (If they find you a table, it will be uncomfortable because you don't have a reservation.) we enjoyed their grape leaves stuffed with rice, pine nuts and currants. I'm going to have to copy this appetizer, also known as yaprak sarmai. We also shared the artichoke braised in lemon while we devoured their delicious bread in virgin olive oil. For a main course, I don't think I've ever had a better hunkar begendi, baby lamb with pureed grilled eggplant. The smokiness of the eggplant was a great compliment to the tomatoes that were braised with the lamb. The meat was tender but not overdone. Minus the coat-check girl-there's a reason why she's stuck with the coats-the service was notable. Perhaps it was quick because the maître d' told us he would need our table after an hour even before we were seated but it didn't feel like the waiters rushed us. They let us enjoy our meal and we actually did.

100 West Houston Street, off Thompson212/254.7000about $100 for two, with two drinks, without tip We needed a table for six during peak dinner hour and Jane called us from a taxi cab on Houston. Seated in the back booth next to the kitchen, we were able to make noise that was way above the hushed tones of the entire restaurant. We started with a bowl of mussels and a plate of calamari. The tarragon in the mussels was a good burst of flavor but the Chardonnay broth was hardly slurpable; it needed some ginger to make it more hearty. My rare yellow fin tuna was excellent, served with spinach, shiitake mushrooms and fingerling potatoes in warm barigoule sauce. The rib eye steak was very tasty with roasted garlic butter which came with a plate of giant onion rings. Never have I ignored good onion rings because of an even better steak. On a Thursday night, the special was lamb with pasta that was only so-so but their dessert menu included warm chocolate chip cookies and a glass of cold milk with vanilla gelato that surely sealed the deal: we like Jane.

171 Grand Street on Baxter 212/343.0090 about $25 for two, without drinks, without tip ♥ ♥ Perhaps the only Korean restaurant near Chinatown, Li Hua attracts a lunch crowd willing to pay $9 for a lunch box of bulgogi, fried zucchini, salad and rice. For us coming from an office in SoHo, $9 isn't bad; it's even better when food under $10 is not Chinese. Not that there's anything wrong with that, but now that we're situated in Chinatown, we've pretty much exhausted our Chinese food options. Li Hua impressed me with their yuk gae jang and chap jae noodles. Their special ramen bowl is also comforting at less than $7. When I'm feeling hungry, their hot stone bibimbap is worth it.

Adapted from Mario Batali's Coda alla Vaccinara Ingredients: 2 lbs calf oxtails, cut in 1/2-inch pieces 3 tbsps tomato paste 3 medium-sized carrots, finely chopped 1/2 cup flat-leaf parsley, finely chopped 4 ribs of celery, leaves reserved, stalks finely chopped 1 red bell pepper, julienned 1 large red onion, thinly chopped 2 cloves of garlic, minced 3 strips of bacon, cut into pieces 1 cup dry white wine a pinch of ground cinnamon 2 tbsps sherry vinegar salt, pepper, red pepper flakes, olive oil 1. Bring 12 cups of water to boil in a large pot. Add the oxtails and reduce heat to simmer for 10 minutes. Drain the oxtails and save 2 cups of the broth. In the 2 cups of broth, dissolved the tomato paste. 2. In a large Dutch oven, heat some olive oil and cook the bacon. Brown the oxtails on both sides and transfer them to a plate. 3. Add garlic, onions, carrots and half the parsley to the pot and sauté until carrots are tender. Return the oxtails and add the wine. Bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to a simmer and cook, uncovered, until the wine is reduced in half. 4. Pour the tomato-broth mixture over the oxtails. Cover and simmer for 1 1/2 hours, stirring every 30 minutes. Then add the celery, cover and cook for 15 minutes. Remove from the heat and transfer the oxtails to a platter. 5. Remove the meat from the bones. (This is a pain in the aSs but the meat should come off easily and a boning knife will help you get into the nooks.) Stir the meat into the sauce to warm it up. Season with salt and pepper. 6. Meanwhile, in a bowl, mix the celery leaves, the remaining parsley, bell pepper, onion, pepper flakes and cinnamon together. Toss with some olive oil and vinegar. Season with salt and pepper. Serve this on top of the oxtail meat.

I got this recipe from Cameron who got it from epicurious.com. It's one of our favorite cold-weather soups. I've done several versions of this, and actually like it better without the beans. Sometimes, I use orzo or leftover boiled white rice if I don't have tortellini available. Because I usually make my own chicken stock, I end up cooking this soup as soon as I've removed all the impurities that float to the top. Ingredients: 1 9-ounce package cheese tortellini 1 packaged fully-cooked smoked kielbasa sausage, thinly sliced 1 15-ounce can cannellini, or white kidney beans, rinsed, drained 1 bunch kale, thoroughly washed, roughly chopped 1 medium-sized fresh fennel bulb, roughly chopped 1 onion, roughly chopped 4 garlic cloves, minced 2 tbsps fresh thyme, chopped 1/2 tsp dried crushed red pepper 10 cups chicken stock 1 cup Asiago cheese or Parmesan cheese, shaved salt, pepper, olive oil 1. Heat oil in heavy large pot over medium-high heat. Sauté garlic until golden, onions until translucent, fennel until soft and kielbasa is brown, about 12 minutes. 2. Add broth and bring to boil. Stir in kale and cannellini. Reduce heat to low and simmer until kale is wilted, about 4 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. 3. Add tortellini to soup. Simmer until pasta is just tender but still firm to bite, about 5 minutes. Ladle soup into bowls. Serve and let your guests top it with cheese.

What would you do if you had a five-hour layover in Houston? If you're like me, then you'd grab your backpack from baggage claim, call 411 for information, ask the airport information clerk and the po-po for directions and finally convince the cab dispatchers to find Burn's Bar BQ so you can eat a decent rack of ribs. We've followed Anthony Bourdain's advice before and ate chapulines, or crickets, in the market of Oaxaca, Mexico. We've tried nose-to-tail eating at St. John's in London. Eating barbecue from one of his favorite barbecue joints in Houston was just too easy. We paid a total of $74 for cab fare to and from the airport to eat three kinds of barbecue with potato salad, white bread and pickles at Burn's Bar BQ. Our entire order cost us less than $15. It took 45 minutes to eat everything. It wasn't the first rack of ribs we've ever had that tasted as good, but man, was it all worth it! Talk about dedication to my meat. Burn's Bar BQ is at 8307 De Priest Street off Williamsdell Street in Houston, Texas. They can ship a big order of ribs to your city if you call 281/445.7574.

113 West 116th Street between Lenox and Adam Clayton212/280.8779about $60 for two, without drinks, without tip Chef Carl Redding opened the restaurant a year after his grandmother, Amy Ruth, passed away. They're not kidding when they say that they offer home-style cooking because you can taste the love in their collard greens and in the gravy of their mashed potatoes. The honey-dipped fried chicken was to die for, flavorful both inside and out. I couldn't have enough of the crispy skin and even the white meat was tasty. I looked forward to ordering the spareribs but they were overdone; swimming in sauce and mushy like bad soup. I like my meat when they easily fall off the bone but I also like gnawing on some actual ribs, not softened bones. They ran out of macaroni and cheese when we visited so we ordered a side of string beans instead which were so overcooked they weren't crunchy nor buttery. Their fried okra was excellent but as soon as they cooled down, the batter became chewy and inedible. I had two slices of the corn bread and somehow, they made up for the restaurant's shortcomings.

Chicago was cool, both literally and figuratively. I was bummed to pack my winter jacket in New York on Friday when it wasn't even cold, but as soon as the wind hit us when we stepped out of O'Hare, I was thankful I didn't put fashion ahead of function. Friday night was all about Persian food at Noon-O-Kabab. Four of us split the lamb shank and the koubideh kababs with eggplants, borani, hummus, warm pita bread and a bottle of Shiraz. The entire meal was a nice welcome greeting. I haven't seen Anna and Mike since we all met up in Manila last year. Saturday was Colombian at Brasa Roja where we watched the lady behind the counter shovel charcoal into the rotisserie pit. Our chicken was all salty goodness together with the arepa (Colombian corn pancakes but Salvadorian pupusas are so much better), plantains plus rice and beans and the bowl of broth peppered with chicken neck and liver. We also stopped by Izumi for some Japanese to tie us over until dinner. The blue fin otoro and their uni were very satisfying. They also had flying fish roe in black, which I've never seen before. We also ordered a flight of sake and a glass of plum wine. Sunday brought us Scandinavian brunch at Tre Kronor: salmon quiche, corned beef sandwich, crabcakes and a hefty onion soup. Their Danish pastries were to die for. Dinner was with other anesthesia residency applicants at Meritage, a New American spot that served pretty impressive monkfish and barracuda. Monday was Mexican at Lindo Michoacan for some awesome chorizo and carne asada tacos. We had to eat something while waiting for the boy to finish his actual interview at the hospital. The tacos alone made us crave \"gourmet\" hotdogs at Hot Doug's. We stayed with Anna in Albany Park and we were within walking distance from a lot of restaurants offering ethnic cuisines. Chicago is just like New York City in that way-the streets are just cleaner. Where to eat in Chicago: Noon-O-Kabab, 4661 N Kedzie Avenue, 773/279.8899 La Brasa Roja, 3125 W Montrose Avenue, 773/866.2252 Izumi Sushi Bar & Restaurant, 731 W Randolph Street, 312/207.5299 Tre Kronor, 3258 W Foster Avenue, 773/267.9888 Meritage Cafe & Wine Bar, 2118 N Damen Avenue, 773/235.6434 Lindo Michoacan, 3148 W Lawrence, 773/539.6627 Hot Doug's Inc, 3324 N California Avenue, 773/279.9550

They proudly declare that \"If you don’t see it, we don't have it!\" The staff has a no-nonsense attitude to match the burgers they serve. They call out your name and you get your burgers wrapped in paper, your fries in a brown bag and your drink in a plastic cup. Thank you very much. Le Parker Meridien burger joint has been one of those (not-so)-secret New York City places that has been written numerous times throughout the years but still enjoys a certain anonymity. And when you're finally there, you can't help but feel glad that you're a part of something so New York.

With decent congee on the menu, I don't know why they try to westernize everything else. XO is probably the only place in Chinatown that serves spaghetti as an alternative to rice. Their rice dishes are only good when you're in a drunken stupor and they will definitely make you wonder why you ordered them in the first place after several hours. Everything comes in some kind of thick brown sauce that reminds me of a poor man's stew, cornstarch and soy sauce galore. But at least they're civilized enough to be served with two stalks of green vegetables.

1250 Broadway on 31st Street212/564-6845about $60 for two, with two drinks, without tip Manhattan's Koreatown pales in comparison with the one in Flushing, Queens and it certainly is embarrassing compared to the one in Los Angeles. Kang Suh is one of the more established restaurants on 31st Street between Broadway and Fifth or Koreablock. It's also one of the restaurants I choose from when I'm with a group of friends who want barbeque. Kalbi or beef ribs are expensive in Manhattan and Korean restaurants, Kang Suh included, charge so much for so little meat but we tend to forget that we're being ripped off after a few bottles of OB and at least an hour's worth of barbeque smell in our clothes. Kang Suh's pan chan or side dishes include kimchi, anchovies and spinach What I usually go for at Kang Suh however is their yuk kae jang, a spicy beef broth soup with bean sprouts and green onions served with noodles and rice. It's enough to clear your sinus and make you forget that it's winter outside. The boy likes their daegoo muhri tang, or codfish soup also served with a bunch of vegetables and sometimes with clams and shrimps.

508 Broome Street between West Broadway and Thompson212/965-1515about $25 for two for lunch, with two drinks, without tip I always come to Karahi when I'm in the mood for more than one helping of chana saag (creamed spinach with chick peas) and tandori chicken and lamb vindaloo and aloo gobhi (cauliflower and potatoes). Not to mention kheer, their rice pudding flavored with fragrant cardamom and pistachios. Karahi's buffet costs about $8.95 a person which is pretty standard for SoHo lunches but if you can eat like me, it's a steal. The restaurant caters to the neighborhood during the day and their dishes are consistently delicious. They know not to make them spicy without sacrificing the most important Indian flavors so that we can all go back to our offices and work for five more hours. There are work days that call for a long, heavy, Indian buffet-style lunch and then there are days that call for a lazy afternoon with a full stomach. Update, August 2006:Karahi has moved to 118 Christopher Street but still has the same phone number.

100 Allen Street between Delancey and Broome212/941-1818about $25 for two, without drinks, without tip When I'm craving congee, I usually run to Congee Village for their $3 hot bowls, either served with pork, chicken, duck, fish, hundred-year-old egg or a combination of all of them. Congee is a type of rice porridge cooked the Chinese way, slowly and with water until the rice has a thicker consistency. It's comfort food and it reminds Filipinos of their own version, arroz caldo. Congee with hot chili oil Congee Village also carries a lot of Chinese food outside their congee selections. I usually order the sauteed lotus root served in bean paste sauce or the assorted vegetables cooked Buddhist style to match. If you like hot pots, their casserole with salted fish is excellent. But skip on these soupy buns. They're always stuck on the wooden bowl, they rip apart when you pick them up and you're left with soupless buns. Get them at Joe's Ginger instead.

We were an hour late for our dinner at Charlie Trotter's because it started to snow and cabs were hard to come by. The staff nonetheless was very accommodating and seated us with no problems when we finally arrived. They served us champagne to let us unwind while they prepared us our dinner. The grand menu was a four-course dinner plus two courses of desserts. Out of everything we ate, the scallops stood out, served with a crab claw and an oyster. The boy cleaned up all his dessert plates while I struggled to finish the very decadent bison and veal cheeks, served with white truffles. All the matching wines were notable. Needless to say, we didn't make it out to listen to some house music after dinner.

130 West Broadway on Duane212/219-1011$250 for three, with several drinks, with tip If there's one New York City chef I'm not familiar with, it would be David Bouley. Four years ago, the boy surprised me by making reservations at Bouley Bakery (now back to its original Bouley name). But it was a hundred-degree summer day and because I didn't know he made plans, I met him wearing flip flops. We had to cancel then and we just never revisited. Turn the calendar to 2005 and Bouley opens Upstairs across the street, a packed space that offers sushi right above his cafe and bakery. I didn't do my homework before I met a client here and while in a cab from work I thought, I could use a nice steak today. As soon as I sat down and read through the menu, I exclaimed, I guess I'm eating sushi tonight! For our sushi, we had a feast and ordered several pieces of uni and otoro (like buttah, baby, buttah!), hamachi, shad and mackerel. For our small plates, we shared a delicate bowl of Japanese tofu with mushrooms in truffle dressing and a very nice serving of monkfish liver, all while we were swimming in their delightful grapefruit sake martinis. Other reviews claim that when the chef is not in the premises, the service tends to be frustrating. I was in the middle of our second sushi plate, happily drunk and satisfied, when I turned around and saw the handsome man with salt and pepper hair behind the open kitchen counter. It's David Bouley himself and maybe that's why our waiter was very attentive. But chef or no chef present, sushi should always mean fresh fish. Upstairs surely provided them.

10:25pm - train back to New York City, delayed 12:10am - finally on board, but with an announcement that we'd arrive an extra hour late 1:00am - somewhere outside Providence when \"the train's axl hit debris\"; delayed another extra hour \"to switch machines\" 4:00am - somewhere in Connecticut, stalls for forty minutes 6:00am - somewhere in upstate New York, stalls for half an hour 6:18am - sunset, still on the fucking train! 7:30am - back in Harlem, kissing my own pillows on my own bed I thought riding in trains was supposed to be romantic. I am still wondering how the Europeans can take me from Amsterdam to Belgium, but the United States can't even get me from Providence to New York City under the three-hour schedule. The boy and I started laughing at ourselves when we first heard of the delay at 10:30pm because I originally rescheduled my 5pm train. I ended up missing the 7:30pm as well because we were having too much fun over dinner. It stopped being funny at midnight. He had to drive at least two hours back to Maine to go to work at 7am, but he couldn't stand to leave me waiting in the station alone. He only left after the Amtrak clerk told him the train was five minutes away from Providence. Despite the inconvenient and frustrating ending to our reunion, we exhausted Rhode Island during the twenty-four hours we spent there. On Friday, he picked me up from the train station at 9pm. We had 9:30pm dinner reservations at De Wolf Tavern so we hurried and drove to Bristol. The staff at the restaurant was accommodating. They still honored my request and sat us by the fireplace even though we arrived fifteen minutes before the kitchen was scheduled to close. Our meal was one of the most refreshing we've had in a long time. Almost every dish had an Indian influence, a nice break from the predictable French taste we've gotten used to in fine dining. With our Glenlivets, Guinness beers and sparkling wine with orange-spiced rum, we shared three appetizers and a main course. The tuna carpaccio was served with green mango salad in mustard oil and verjus chutney. The tortellini was stuffed with king crab meat and drizzled with sauce made of fried curry leaves that tasted deliciously nutty. The quail legs were roasted and came with a pretty boring salad of iceberg lettuce and bacon and ranch dressing, but the infused tandoor flavor in the quail perfectly came out at every bite. The medium-rare rib-eye steak completed our meal with crunchy haricot verts and mashed potatoes. To end the night, we also split the cafe au lait ice cream on top of warm pumpkin bread. Esquire Magazine might have prematurely picked The Modern as one of its 2005 restaurant of the year, but they hit the bull's-eye with De Wolf Tavern. De Wolf Tavern is about a thirty-minute drive from Providence in Rhode Island. It's at 259 Thames Street in Bristol. Call 405/254.2005 for reservations.

I've never been to Rhode Island before, so when the boy proposed the idea that we meet there because it was a short drive from Maine, I bought a train ticket from New York to meet him. Before I left from work, I booked a room at Edgewood Manor and dinner twenty-something miles away at De Wolf Tavern, an Esquire Magazine restaurant pick for 2005. In Providence, we stopped by for one drink at The Hi-Hat, a lounge with a live jazz band, before we drove back to our bed and breakfast inn. We had a late start on Saturday-the jacuzzi in our room had everything to do with it-but we still had a full day which started at Rue de L'Espoir. I ordered poached eggs on top of crab cakes because I was still remembering the king crab legs I ate the night before at De Wolf Tavern. After brunch, we drove to the art galleries in Reez-Dee and in Brown University. We walked around the campus. The boy thought of how much they both looked like Amherst College, his alma matter. It was very sunny and warm, the perfect autumn day in New England. We also drove to Federal Hill, Rhode Island's Italian neighborhood, where we made stops at Scialo Bakery to pick up a couple of tarts, Pastiche to drink iced coffees, Roma Gourmet to buy prosciutto and sopressata, and Antonelli's Poultry, where you select a live chicken or turkey to be killed for your dinner. Needless to say, the smell in the poultry store left us breathless. Dinner was at McCormick and Schmick's where we shared a half dozen oysters and a bowl of mussels with chorizo, plus a bowl of corn chowder and a plate of baby arugula and goat cheese. I decided to let my 5:30pm train go because we were having too much of a good time. Providence looked beautiful with the sunset's glow. The neighborhood has a very industrial look, complete with red-bricked warehouses turned into lofts, but it also has the typical colonial houses that are very much New England. Add some maple and oak trees shedding leaves and I'm in-love all over again. Related post/s: We stayed in Edgewood Manor for the weekend De Wolf Tavern restaurant review

9 West 53rd Street at The Museum of Modern Art between Fifth and Sixth Avenues212/333-1220about $150 for two, with two drinks, without tip I haven't been back to the new MoMA ever since it reopened in its grand, newly renovated space in midtown Manhattan. The twenty-dollar entrance fee is a little too steep for a lazy Saturday afternoon but when Esquire magazine named Danny Meyer's The Modern restaurant of the year, I knew I had to make a return trip. It also just recently received one star from the Michelin and that's a very big accomplishment considering it just opened a year ago. I made dinner reservations at The Bar Room to make our Wednesday night a little less formal than if we were in the main dining area. It's busier and more crowded. The buzz all around makes you think it's a Friday night somewhere in the Meatpacking District. I also prefer the small-plate way of eating. This way, my friend and I can taste more than three things from the menu and really get an idea of what the chef is trying to bring out from the kitchen. In this case, it's Gabriel Kreuther's skills from Alsace honed while doing a stint at the Ritz-Carlton. The menu is adventurous that even if it guides you to order one from each section -- from a small portion to a medium one onto a full serving -- I still ordered a medium, a large and another large. I could not help but try the baekeoffe, an Alsatian stew slow-cooked in an earthenware pot. Instead of beef, The Modern version consisted of lamb, conch and tripe. A very interesting dish indeed with scrumptious baked crumbs on top, perfect with a glass of Cotes du Provence. The scallops and oxtail were served in two ways: a lone seared scallop on top of shredded oxtail on the left and another scallop next to it wrapped in oxtail meat shaped to look like, for lack of a better word, a huge testicle. This dish would have been rich enough to end the night (rich because of its flavor, not because of the testicle allusion) so I immediately regretted ordering the next dish. The pork cheeks were braised in sauerkraut and ginger jus which was even better as a leftover lunch the day after. If I had any more room in my stomach, I thought the tagliatelle with escargots, hen of the woods and basil was as tempting as the olive-crusted lamb loin with chanterelle ragout and butternut squash and roasted celeriac. Thankfully, my friend was watching her weight so she had a reason to excuse the bland grilled shrimp with cabbage and gruyere salad or the swordfish served with eggplant mush. Our waitress worked like a zombie and ruined our dining experience with her expressionless manner. I can excuse tasteless seafood but unexciting service means one star less for The Modern.

105 North 6th Street between Berry and Wythe Streets, Williamsburg, Brooklyn718/963-0608 $150 for three, with three drinks, with tip Nothing on the menu tops twenty dollars at Sweetwater and that's a very good thing. Even for dishes under that price, portions are generous and we wonder why we do not go to Williamsburg more often. (Of course, walking down the street later and seeing the boys who looked and dressed alike reminded us of why we don't.) The potato gnocchi was very light; even the decadent sauce did not make the dish too hearty. The roasted hen was served with mushrooms and it smelled perfectly of autumn but fowl is still fowl so the meat dries up easily when slightly overdone. The grouper was tender, served with clams and kale in tomato sauce. I thought the kale was perfect for this because its slightly bitter flavor gave way for the tomatoes. My friends and I chatted the night away and after dinner, our waitress offered us complimentary coffees to make up for the long wait we endured while cooking the hen. What long wait? She was so attentive we didn't even think it took that long and so we appreciated the gesture. Service as good as Sweetwater's doesn't come easily in Manhattan so why don't we go to Brooklyn more often again?

7 East 47th Street 2nd floor between Madison and Fifth Avenues212/317-2802$350 for two, with four beers, with tip Dining in Kurumazushi is no joke and that's apparent as soon as you walk in the tight second floor space in midtown Manhattan. The entire staff greets you loudly and the attention given doesn't wane until you leave the building. Our waiter watched us eat like a hawk. A drop spilled from the boy's teacup and he came running to wipe his tray clean. A dangling piece of mackerel escaped my big bite and he immediately replaced my mat. Our sushi chef at the bar was old but he was also the jolliest and the liveliest Japanese man I've ever met. His assistant is surprisingly a young Dominican (!) woman (!) who has been training under his tutelage for about ten years (!). We opted for the omakase and never regretted a second of it until the $350 bill came at the end of the night. The chef started us off with otoro, then the yellowfin, the clam, the snapper and the mackerel, everything prepared in pairs. When we told him that we were getting full, he asked if we wanted to end our meal with uni. A smile reached my ears; there's always room for a sea urchin or two. We also asked for miso and nameko mushroom soup to calm our stomachs. I've followed Ruth Reichl to Kurumazushi but I don't think I will ever return and eat there again unless someone else foots the bill.

13th Street on Ninth Avenue, New York City212/675-2322$150 for three, with three drinks, without tip You walk into Spice market and you immediately think, This place is massive! The place is beautifully decorated, if not a little too dark, and utilizes a lot of wood instead of glass like 66, another Jean-Georges restaurant. Spice Market is bustling. There are staff members constantly running around. Some of them in backless salmon-colored pantsuits and tunics, some in short mini-skirts. The less attractive ones, I noticed, were wearing black sweaters and jeans. Our table was for 8pm and the place was already hoppin' by the time we got there. The constant traffic is a little disorienting but I do not expect less from a restaurant in the Meatpacking District. In this neighborhood, you go to party, not to eat. The food is typical Jean-Georges. You are encouraged to order several dishes to share with your group family-style. We started with the black-peppered shrimps with pineapple. The sweet and sour mixed with the spicyness was a good introduction but I ate more pineapple than I did shrimps for $14.50. The lime noodles were served with too much lime and I was cringing at every bite. I like my pasta al dente but I prefer my noodles soft and slippery. The mussels and the chicken wings, I felt, did not belong in the menu even though they were smothered with chili sauce and basil leaves. Good thing I had my Singha to match. The green papaya was delicious as well as the squid salad. We were finally eating Thai food without the frills. I liked the halibut which was perfectly crisp on the outside and tender on the inside. I also loved the shaved tuna sashimi which came with small tapioca pearls in coconut milk. It tasted clean and pure. The mint tea was a great end to the overwhelming flavors that fought for my attention. By 11pm, nothing else mattered. I'm satisfied with simplicity. I don't need the entire production to be impressed.

176 Perry Street on West212/352-1900about $150 for two, with two drinks, without tip Whenever I tried to make a reservation at Perry St., my only option was either 6pm or at 11:30. When I met my dining partner at our table in the back, the restaurant looked very empty at six. Perhaps they were reserving the tables just in case Nicole Kidman or Lenny Kravitz, residents of the Richard Meier building that also houses the restaurant, decide to drop by. Perry St. is Jean-Georges Vongerichten's eighth restaurant in Manhattan and it shows. The modernist interior welcomes the sunset glow along the Hudson River; it screams New York City. Diners look like the more affluent version of Spice Market's fans but are a little older than the people in 66, two more of Jean-Georges' establishments. The food is more \"new American\" but still focuses on the simplest Asian fares like red snapper sashimi, crab dumplings and roasted cod. Our fig dessert was served on a warm biscuit with ice cream, a delightful offering that was similar to one I had in London's The Farm. They do not have a lot of wine available by the glass but a few good Belgian and German beers can be ordered from the bar.

This is one of my favorite summer salads adapted from Dan Barber's Blue Hill Restaurant in New York City. In the summer, you can go to the market and all kinds of tomatoes are available. Watermelon also come cheap. This salad is already refreshing, but to add mint and basil in it just makes it more special. Ingredients: 1 watermelon, preferably seedless, rind removed, cubed 1 quart of yellow, red, orange cherry or graped tomatoes, halved lemon juice red wine vinegar 1 small Thai chili, chopped handful of basil, finely chopped handful of mint leaves, finely chopped olive oil, salt, pepper 1. Into a bowl, whisk the vinegar and the oil. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Add the chili and the herbs. 2. Add the tomatoes and the watermelon. Toss. Chill and serve.

If you can get past the yuck factor, they make great crostini. It has this rich buttery flavor that goes great with the lively, bright flavors of the parsley/shallot mixture.

Adapted from The New York Times Ingredients: 1 1/2 pounds skirt steak 1 tbsp nam pla (Thai fish sauce) 1 tsp sugar 1 small Thai chili, stemmed and seeded 2 tbsps fresh lime juice 2 tsps chopped garlic, or to taste 2 medium shallots, chopped 1/2 cup mint leaves, finely chopped 1/2 cup cilantro, finely chopped leaves of Boston lettuce, washed and dried salt and pepper 1. Combine fish sauce, pepper, sugar, chili, lime juice, garlic and shallots in a small glass bowl and mash with a pestle. Add mint and cilantro and mash some more. Taste and adjust seasonings as you like. 2. Sprinkle steak with salt and pepper and grill 4 minutes a side. Cut into strips, arrange over lettuce, and serve with sauce and roll up. Note: Recipe calls for grilling. In my New York City kitchen, I simply cooked the steak in a skillet with very hot oil. I also used Romaine lettuce as a substitute.

Adapted from The Tasting Room, New York City Ingredients: 2 pints of oyster mushrooms 1 cup sugar snap peas, destringed 1 tbsp distilled white vinegar 4 large eggs chicken stock 1 tbsp butter 1/3 cup crushed hazelnuts 2 tbsp chives, minced salt and pepper 1. Clean mushrooms, using your fingers to brush away dirt and remove woody parts. Break into bite-size pieces. Set aside. 2. Place a small pot of salted water over high heat. When water boils, add peas and cook until tender, 3 to 4 minutes. Drain into a colander and rinse with cold water. 3. Place a sauté pan over medium-high heat, add mushrooms and stir until their color deepens and aroma intensifies, about two minutes. Sprinkle with a pinch of salt, remove from heat and continue stirring. After a minute, mushrooms should release some liquid; if not, add a tablespoon or two of the stock. Return pan to heat, add butter and peas and stir until hot, about 2 minutes. Shut off heat and divide among four plates. 4. Fill a deep skillet with a few inches of water, add vinegar and salt and place over high heat. Crack eggs into small, separate cups. When water boils, reduce heat to a low simmer and carefully pour in eggs one at a time. Cook until whites are firmly set. Strain eggs with a slotted spoon and transfer each to a plate atop mushrooms. Sprinkle with hazelnuts, chives and freshly ground black pepper. Serve immediately.

5 Mott Street at Worth, New York City 212/566-8388 about $60 for two, without drinks, without tip ♥ ♥ I never thought I'd say this but I love vegetarian food! That is, if it's from Buddha Bodai. They specialize in both kosher and Buddhist vegetarian meals, so during a busy day, the restaurant is abuzz. Sundays are a scene when the Jews and the Chinese are in one room eating dim-sum. Service is efficient and fast, but don't expect all of them to warm up to you; it's nothing personal. Most people get turned off with gluten because the fake meat does not sound appealing to them. I'm an omnivore, so I tend to agree, but Buddha Bodai does vegetarian really well. The lettuce song is crispy rice, fried noodles and pine nuts. You put some plum sauce on a piece of lettuce, scoop some of the filling and wrap it and eat it like a roll. I love the texture of this dish and it's one of their best appetizers. The barbecue is a must-have. It's actually the dish that changed my mind about vegetarian food. It's so tasty, I could even be convinced that it's not gluten but real meat. I love the mushroom with black bean sauce. The mushroom flavor is so intense even the thick brown sauce can't cover it. The crispy duck is really paper-thin tofu skins that taste even better when dipped in duck sauce. At Buddha Bodai, you'll also have the best broccoli of your life. They're bright green and perfectly tender flash-fried in garlic sauce. I wish parents would introduce their children to their version of broccoli as I'm sure any one, no matter what age, will love them. Don't skip the ginger pine nut fried rice or the house special congee especially if you go with a big group of people. The servings are more than enough and everything is so much better to share with your friends, dim-sum style.

I cook duck more than I cook turkey because I can easily buy it fresh from Chinatown. There's something about roasting your own duck and waiting for its skin to turn into that right shade of golden brown-mahogany, even. Ingredients: 1 whole fresh duck, excess fat trimmed, giblets removed 1/4 cup miso 1 cup honey 2 cups soy sauce 1 cup cold black coffee 1/4 cup ginger, finely chopped 1/3 cup brown sugar 1 orange, halved 1 lemon, halved 1 lime, halved 1. Wash duck and dry with paper towels. Using a fork, pierce the duck skin all over to allow the flavor of the marinade to penetrate and the fat to drain. 2. Prepare the marinade. Combine all ingredients in a large bowl except for the citrus. Stir well until miso and sugar are dissolved. Squeeze the citrus juice into the marinade then stuff the cavity of the duck with the citrus halves. Marinate the duck on a plate, cover and refrigerate for 24 hours. 3. When ready to roast the next day, preheat oven to 450º. Place the duck on a rack in a roasting pan. Fold the wings back and tie the legs together. Roast the duck for 20 minutes to caramelize the sugar and set a rich, mahogany color. After 20 minutes, drop the temperature to 325º and roast for another hour. Related post/s: Where to buy duck

I've watched the boy make this stuffed flank steak for me before. When I wanted to try it at home, I called him for the recipe. All I got was, \"Stuff it, roll it, fry it.\" Simple instructions for a meal that looks like a hundred bucks. I used everything I found in my fridge before I went away for the weekend. If the flank could have talked, it would have begged for me to stop. Ingredients: 1 flank steak, butterflied and tenderized small red bell pepper, julienned small green bell pepper, julienned 1/2 pound of crimini mushrooms, sliced several slices of prosciutto and soppresatta 4 cloves of garlic, crushed, finely chopped 1 small red onion, finely chopped 1/2 cup breadcrumbs a handful of parsley, finely chopped salt, pepper, olive oil 1. Preheat oven to 350º. In a hot skillet, heat olive oil and sauté garlic and onions. Add peppers and mushrooms and cook for a few minutes until mushrooms are soft. Add parsley and season with salt and pepper. 2. Lay steak out flat and add a layer of prosciutto and soppresatta. Top with the bell pepper and mushroom mixture. Slowly roll the steak up like a big sushi roll, pulling at the ends so it's not too thick in the middle. Tie with kitchen string to pack the stuffing in. Brush with oil. 3. In a hot skillet, heat more olive oil and brown all sides of the stuffed flank steak for some color. Do not over fry to avoid hardening the meat. Transfer to a shallow baking dish. Brush with more oil and bake until medium-rare. Remove from oven and allow to cool for about 10 minutes. Cut strings off. Slice into 3/4-inch pieces and serve.

I can now truly respect mothers who work full-time and still manage to cook a decent meal for her family at the end of the day. After work yesterday, I ran to Di Palo's to get my usual cheeses and meats. I was uptown soon after picking last-minute grocery items. I had two hours to cook dinner for Tita Pat and Tito Square who are both in town from Manila. I have never felt so taranta in the kitchen. After a few fuck-ups, I paused and told myself to calm the hell down or nothing will ever come out right. So I poured myself a shot of Glenlivet 12 on the rocks to take the edge off. Then, I was ready. I multi-tasked in the kitchen for the next hour and a half. The bell rang as soon as I started heating up the Le Creuset for the jerk chicken. The dozen or so pieces took a while because I had to brown them before baking them, to get the marinade all sticky and, well, I guess, jerky. But the guest couple of the night brought their nieces and nephews with them, so all seven of us were chit-chatting while the chicken was cooking. I served these with yellow rice spiced with thyme and garlic. It was a lot of work, but expect high spirits while you watch your guests devour everything. Use disposable gloves when chopping the Scotch bonnet chiles and rubbing the chicken pieces because you don't want to accidentally touch your face while you're cooking. Trust me on that. Ingredients: 12 pieces chicken, drumsticks and wings 3 fresh Scotch bonnet chiles, seeded and finely chopped 1 medium yellow onion, coarsely chopped 8 scallions, coarsely chopped 6 garlic cloves, crushed and chopped 3 tbsps fresh thyme, finely chopped 1/4 cup packed dark brown sugar 2 tbsps ground allspice 1 1/4 tsps ground nutmeg 1 tsp ground cinnamon 1/2 cup white vinegar 1/4 cup soy sauce 1/4 cup fresh lime juice 1/4 cup vegetable oil salt, pepper 1. Make jerk marinade. Process chiles, scallions, garlic and thyme in food processor until pastey. Add brown sugar, allspice, nutmeg, cinnamon, vinegar, soy sauce, lime juice, oil. Season with salt and pepper. Process until smooth. 2. Transfer 1/3 of the marinade in an airtight container and set aside for brushing chicken when ready. 3. Transfer the remaining marinade in a large bowl. Add chicken, coating and rubbing marinade all over chicken pieces and under skin. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight. Allow chicken to come to room temperature before cooking. 4. When ready, preheat oven to 350º. Heat a large skillet and add oil. When oil is hot, add chicken pieces to brown both sides, about 30 minutes. Do this a few pieces at a time to avoid overcrowding and use fresh oil for every batch. Discard used marinade. 5. Transfer browned chicken to a baking dish. Brush generously with remaining unused marinade and bake until cook through, about 15 minutes. Related post/s: Serve baked stuffed peppers beforehand

After my first successful try at making gelée, I decided to try this Martha Stewart Living recipe. I served it as dessert when family friends from Manila visited New York City. It didn't match the jerk chicken main course but that's why I think they were tickled to be eating it to end their night. Ingredients: 1/2 cup apple juice 1 packet unflavored gelatin 1 cup full-bodied red wine, like Zinfandel 1/4 cup sugar 1 pint blackberries 1. Prepare an ice-water bath. Set aside. 2. Add 1/2 cup water and apple juice in a bowl. Sprinkle with gelatin. Let soften for about 5 minutes. 3. Combine wine and sugar in a saucepan. Bring to a boil over high heat while stirring to dissolve sugar. Add blackberries, leaving some for garnish, and simmer in reduced heat. Crush blackberries as you stir. 4. Remove saucepan from heat. Slowly stir in hot wine mixture with the gelatin mixture. Transfer bowl to ice-water bath and stir gently to cool. 5. Pour mixture into a plastic bowl to mold. Chill until firm and ready to use. 6. When ready, unmold gelée and top with a blackberry and a mint leaf. Related post/s: Jerk Chicken

163 1st Avenue between 10th and 11th Streets 212/475-7899 about $80 for two, with two drinks, with tip ♥ ♥ Updated, 2007: Momofuku has moved two stores down to make room for the third restaurant in their family, Momofuku Ko Momofuku, which means \"lucky peach,\" is a nicely-designed noodlebar with mostly Japanese and Korean-influenced dishes plus a touch of Chinese. It reminded me of London's Wagamama, which means \"naughty child\" in Nihongo, famous for their inexpensive and quick fast food as for their interior's design. We shared a plate of baby bok choy, flash-fried in hot oil, garlic and chilis-a good start to whet the appetite. Since it was almost a hundred degrees out, I picked the Momofuku somen with chilled noodles and dipping broth. My bowl came with mushrooms and very yummy shredded Berkshire pork which reminded me of leftover Filipino lechon, or roast pork. It's a huge serving and more than enough for my hungry self. My companion opted for the pork neck ramen with neck meat and poached egg. It was also delicious. Both were served with scallions and menma, or bamboo shoots. Even if it looks like a ramenya, a place that sells ramen in Japan, any new visitor would be glad to know that it just isn't that. Dishes change seasonally, just like David Chang, owner and chef, learned at Craft. The noodles are not soggy and they have the right firmness and tenderness. There are buns, kimchi chigae, or fermented vegetables in soybean paste soup, and Sichuan-spiced crawfish in the menu. I normally cook the baby bok choy at home when they are in season, so I thought the $8 price was pretty steep. Our tall Hefeweizens were also $10 apiece. In fact, everything is priced twice as much as its counterparts along St. Marks. Alas, this is New York City and this is the lower east side.

60 Clinton Street between Rivington and Stanton 212/253.1960 about $100 for two, with two drinks, without tip ♥ ♥ ♥ I rarely go to an Italian restaurant because I can't, and don't want to, eat a whole big bowl of pasta. Falai serves the familiar but transcends at the same time because of the imaginative use of ingredients. Rich chicken livers were served with a fluff of polenta but also surrounded with chanterelles. The baby octopus did not come with vinaigrette but instead cooked with caramelized Gaeta olives for that mildly sweet taste. Eggplants fried in batter sounded off-putting in 90-degree weather but they were sliced so thin and done so lightly, perfectly. For our main course, we split the ravioli squid ink pasta stuffed with pine nuts, scallops, white asparagus fonduta and baked zucchini. It was heavenly. Before chef Iacopo Falai managed the kitchen of Bread TriBeCa, he was the pastry chef at Le Cirque 2000. He pays tributes to his roots with the restaurant's dessert menu, but alas, we had to settle for a dainty strawberry sorbet because we still had glasses of Veltliner and Tocai and Prosecco to finish.

I'm not a big fan of mayo so I used the light kind for this recipe. Make sure you serve this as soon as you plate it so that the mayo doesn't look curdled and the greens do not wilt. Ingredients: 6 scallops pinch of saffron threads 1/4 cup light mayonnaise 1 1/2 tbsps of cream 1 tsp lemon juice butter olive oil mixed greens 1. To make the dressing, place saffron threads in a bowl and soak in 2 tsps of hot water for ten minutes. Add mayo and mix well until rich yellow. Stir in the cream and then lemon juice. Refrigerate until needed. 2. Heat butter and olive oil in a hot skillet. Sear scallops, about 2 minutes each side. 3. Serve scallops on a bed of mixed greens. Top with saffron dressing.

I know I have a lot of favorites, but this is really one of them. I loved the fact that a dish with game can still be fresh and light just by adding mint leaves and julienned summer vegetables. Ingredients: lamb fillets 1 medium red onion, sliced thinly half a red bell pepper, julienned half a green bell pepper, julienned half a cucumber, julienned handful of fresh mint, finely chopped handful of fresh dill, roughly chopped fresh lemon juice 2 garlic cloves, crushed and finely chopped salt, pepper, olive oil 1. Combine the vegetables in a large bowl with the mint and dill. 2. Heat a frying pan, add olive oil. When oil is hot, fry lamb fillets until tender but still pink, about 2-3 minutes per side. Remove from pan and allow to cool. Set aside for about 5 minutes. When cool, thinly slice the lamb and toss in the salad. 3. In a screw-top jar, combine lemon juice, garlic and olive oil. Season with salt and pepper. Shake well. Pour in salad and toss lightly.

This was a sweet recipe from Amanda Hesser of The New York Times. Sweet, as in, new and exciting. I made it as an appetizer for a party I threw for my Dominican and Ecuadorian girlfriends. You can use cheap sake for this but definitely get the good-quality and real crab meat from your fishmonger. Ingredients: 3 medium-sized tomatoes, chopped 1/4 cup of sake 1 pound of crab meat 1 packet of unflavored gelatin, softened in 2 tbsps water zest of 1 lemon juice of half a lemon 8 basil leaves, thinly sliced salt, pepper, olive oil 1. Purée tomatoes in a food processor. Strain through a sieve into a saucepan. It should lead about 1 cup. Add the sake and heat over medium-low fire until warm. Season with a little salt. 2. Remove from heat and stir in softened gelatin until fully dissolved. Pour into a plastic bowl to mold. Chill until firm and ready to use. 3. Just before serving, combine crab meat, zest, lemon juice, olive oil and basil leaves in a bowl. Season with salt and pepper. Toss lightly. Place a small mound on a plate. 4. Unmold gelée and chop into triangles. Place next to the crab salad. Related post/s: Where to buy crab meat

This was one of the best dishes I've ever had to cook and eat alone. I served this on top of kimchi-flavored fried rice. Ingredients: chicken breast fillet handful of mint leaves, finely chopped handful of cilantro, finely chopped half a cucumber, cut through center and thinly sliced handful of snap peas, blanched 2 stalks of scallions, sliced diagonally 2 tbsps rice wine 1 tbsp soy sauce 1 tbsp lemon juice 2 tbsps sweet chili sauce salt, pepper 1. Coat chicken fillets with salt and pepper. Cover and refrigerate until ready to cook. 2. Combine mint leaves, cilantro, cucumber, snap peas and scallions in a bowl. Season with salt and pepper. 3. Heat a frying pan and add olive oil. When oil is hot, fry chicken until cooked through, about 8 minutes per side. Remove from pan and allow to cool. Set aside. When cool, slice the chicken diagonally and toss with the vegetables. 4. For the dressing, combine rice wine, soy sauce, lemon juice and sweet chili sauce. Pour over the chicken and the vegetables and toss until well coated. Related post/s: Kimchi for kimchi-flavored fried rice

I used to buy this ginger citrus iced tea from Balthazar's Bakery in the summer. When we moved offices from SoHo to Chinatown, it was one of the small pleasures I started to miss. Now I make my own. It takes patience to make your own ginger-citrus juice, but you can use any ginger tea bag you like. In Chinatown, you can buy ginger honey crystals from a brand called Prince of Peace. They're pretty strong and very gingery. Ingredients: 1 large knob of ginger, peeled, crushed fresh lemon juice fresh mint leaves orange peels ice cubes 1. In a small saucepan, boil a pitcher-full of water with the ginger and orange peels. When water is boiling, lower the fire and simmer until water is reduced. Mix in lemon juice and mint leaves. Turn off the heat and set aside to cool. 2. When ready to serve, strain and pour the cooled ginger-orange mixture into a carafe. Serve with ice. Garnish with leftover mint leaves and orange peels.

194 Elizabeth Street between Prince and Spring, New York City 212/965.9511 about $150 for two, with two drinks, without tip ♥ ♥ ♥ It's hard to convince me to try a restaurant dubbed \"Best Place to Impress a First Date\" but after walking by Peasant one afternoon, I thought of it as the best place to treat my special someone to dinner. The first thing you see as soon as you walk in is the fire from the brick oven in the back where they cook all their Italian fare the traditional way. The dark wood gives the restaurant a rustic feel, but the aluminum chairs add a touch of modernity. We split the baked scallops topped with breadcrumbs and the octopus in vinaigrette. The beet and mixed greens salad was excellent. We like it when the waitstaff gives us some time in between courses, but Peasant stretched it a bit too long. The appetizers settled in our stomachs, that by the time the boy's squab was served, we were already full. We started to slice the bird but had to send it back because it was too rare. Maybe the cooks in the back need more light than the brick oven provides. I also had to hold up a candle to see what kind of beans arrived on our table-fava-and what mushrooms smelled so good-porcini-with my sweetbreads. I've never had sweetbreads as a main course before but if there's a restaurant that takes everything to the max, Peasant is it. For dessert, we wished for the peach tart topped with hazelnut ice cream but decided to skip it after we saw that it was more that the size of a big slice. I appreciate big portions for the amount of money they charge, but there are times when I'd prefer a smaller plate rather than a gluttonous one. Fortunately, a smaller space in the basement offers smaller plates.

222 West 79th Street between Broadway and Amsterdam 212/873.0200 about $200 for two, with two drinks, with tip ♥ ♥ ♥ Updated, 2007: Chef Michael Psilakis has turned Onera into cash-only Kelfi. He has also opened Anthos at 36 West 52nd Street off Fifth Avenue, 212/582.6900 My party was forty minutes late but the Onera staff was very accommodating. Perhaps I was already sitting and consuming alcohol at the bar and they had no other choice but to wait for my seven other diningmates. When they finally showed up, our table for eight was situated perfectly in the back of the tiny basement restaurant. When my friends wanted to try something different without paying for a ridiculously expensive omakase at a sushi restaurant, I thought of Onera because Greek is not always the first thing in people's minds when they think of dinner, so it can only be a curious choice. My friends' filet mignon were all done the way they preferred. A couple ordered pork tenderloin and they were both delicious, served with fennel and toasted garlic velouté. I went off the too-familiar list and started with two dishes from their meze menu, or small appetizers. The sea urchin came on top of pickled beets and cheese. Everyone wanted to taste my uni and unfortunately, I had to give up three out of the five on my small plate. The scallops came with yogurt cucumber sauce and a whiff of anise. I only had three pieces so I devoured them before anyone said anything. For my main meal, I divided my attention between the chilled roasted octopus and the crispy sweetbreads. Again, everyone's forks were attacking my plates and I could not help but scold them for choosing the steak and the pork belly without thinking of the other items on the menu. But even though I did not have enough, the octopus was nice and tarty and the sweetbreads divine. Even with foie gras and sheep milk fraiche, the sweetbreads were not overly decadent to turn me off. Onera did not disappoint me, nor my picky friends.

314 West 11th Street at Greenwich Street 212/620.0393 about $100 for two, with a few drinks, without tip ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ Updated, 2007: A second floor space has opened, but I still waited two and a half hours on a Saturday even after I put my name down at 6:45pm It's no surprise that one of my favorite chefs, Mario Batali, helped open The Spotted Pig in the West Village. One look at the menu and a wanna-be foodie like me would immediately appreciate the tongue and the kidney, two items that are almost always expected in a restaurant that calls itself a \"gastro-pub.\" The chargrilled burger with roquefort cheese and shoestring fries in garlic and rosemary is a must-try. Order it meat medium-rare and I can bet it will satisy the carnivore in you, even if you don't like stinky cheese. During my first visit, I ordered the ramps and they came wrapped in pancetta. It's pretty steep at $14 but if you like ramps in the spring like I do, it's an appetizer you can't skip. I also had the rabbit cooked with fiddlehead ferns, a vegetable also only available in the spring. With two of my favorite vegetables on the same menu at the same night, I swore I would return. When I finally did, I ordered the poached lamb's tongue and the pan-fried veal kidney. The tongue was served with lentils and fava beans. The tarragon plus the sour cream gave the dish a little kick and they helped melt the tongue in my, well, tongue. Even though several pieces of the tongue were sliced, I could not help but notice that one was actually a whole piece. It looked like the lamb went Maaah and then the whoosh of the butcher's knife just sliced it. It made for interesting photo anyway. The veal kidney was a little too overwhelming. I understood that another strong ingredient was needed to bring out the offal taste of the kidneys, but I thought prosciutto and mustard sauce were too salty to complement them. The combination was so powerful that they were all competing in my mouth. And this is when the pub's role comes in. The Spotted Pig has about one hundred different bottles of wine on their list, together with a few pale ales and stouts. Hand-pumped Old Speckled Hen comes in handy with all that offal. Visit on a weeknight and expect to wait for an hour. Visit on a weekend and expect to wait for two hours. Everyone in New York City wants to be at the Pig.

they must have a seasonal menu (nice) because none of the stuff you ate, they had last night. crispy pig ear salad? strange, but I couldn't stop eating it. I was looking for the tongue and kidney dish above, to no avail. decent grub, but too heavy and rich for me. good veg tho.

6 Clinton Street off Houston 212/674.6300 about $80 for two, with two drinks, without tip ♥ Update, 2007: The space is for sale Chubo's offerings are familiar but the combination of all of them makes the menu a little confused. The hamachi was served two ways: tartare and the other, glazed with teriyaki. They had foie gras but unfortunately in shumai form. Their steak sits on wasabi-truffle sauce. Our soft-shell crabs were excellent, but I was a bit surprised they came with duck. Perhaps the chef just wanted to offer a little bit of everything, or maybe he just couldn't make up his mind about which cuisine to concentrate on.

I love how rich the green of this soup is. If your guest is adamant about eating soup with meat, brown some bacon and chop to smaller pieces. Add the bacon at the same time you garnish the soup with the asparagus tips. Ingredients: vegetable stock 1 bunch of asparagus, chopped, reserving the tips 1 leek, white parts only, chopped 1 medium red onion, roughly chopped half a bunch of flat-leaf parsley, roughly chopped half a stick of butter grated lemon peel salt, pepper 1. Melt butter in a large soup pot. Sauté garlic and onions. Add leeks and cook until soft, about 3 minutes. Add the asparagus stems, onion and parsley with salt and pepper. Add vegetable stock and bring to a boil. Then simmer until asparagus is tender, about 5 minutes. 2. Purée mixture using a blender, in batches if necessary. Return soup to pot and thin with more stock if desired. 3. In a separate pot, boil some water and cook asparagus tips for about 2 minutes with some salt. Use as garnish for soup.

135A North 5th Street off Bedford Avenue, Williamsburg, Brooklyn 718/302.5151 about $50 for two, without drinks, with tip ♥ ♥ ♥ My only complaint about egg is that it stops serving breakfast at noon. That doesn't give me enough time to wake up in Harlem and trudge all the way to Brooklyn to eat breakfast. I'm sure the hipsters who live in the neighborhood feel the same way. But if any of us need a good reason to wake up, it's breakfast via the L train to Williamsburg. The menu is short, southern-inspired and most especially, organic. There's the delicious ham and the orgasmic bacon, the fresh and warm homemade biscuits with sausage gravy, the grits made with love, the fig jam and the oh-so-real potato hash. If you've never made a big deal of breakfast, you've never had a meal at egg. One bite and you'd forget that you'd otherwise still be sleeping. The best part of it all is still feeling pretty good after your big meal. Every ingredient was selected by its chef, George Weld, to make sure that you're not putting anything bad in your mouth. This is important because, hey, you still have seven hours to go before the sun goes down. Related post/s: Sparkys All-American Food

The staff is not the friendliest-every time I visit, I always wait outside for at least 30 minutes to be seated even though there are empty tables inside. I've learned to bug the waiters, though, and point to an empty table and volunteer my party to be seated right away. I don't understand how they work, but it's hard to say no to a comforting tagine.

I love Everyday Food because they have simple recipes like this pastry snack using the frozen kind. I'm sure Martha would prefer that you make your own pastry shell from scratch and pick raspberries from your own garden, but frozen pastry and raspberries in a jar work, too. Ingredients: 1 box or 6 pieces of frozen puff pastry shells, thawed raspberry jam white sugar 1. Preheat oven at 400º. Spread jam on shells and sprinkle with white sugar on top. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and bake until pastries are puffed and golden, about 10 minutes. Sprinkle with a little more sugar. Let cool and serve.

How do you dress up ham? If you're Filipino, there'd be pineapple slices and cherries on top, but if you're French, you use lavender. I went all over Manhattan to find fresh lavender sprigs and finally found them at a Whole Foods store in Chelsea. I'm not French, of course, but who says I can't snazz up my ham like they do? Ingredients: 1 fresh ham, 3 to 4 pounds 1/2 cup garlic, cut into slivers 4 sprigs thyme 2 sprigs rosemary 4 sprigs lavender 1 medium can of diced tomatoes 1 cup lavender honey zest and juice of 1 lemon 1 tbsp fennel seed salt and pepper 1. Preheat oven at 325º. Score the ham crosswise and place in an oven-safe roaster pot of boiling salted water. Simmer for 3 minutes and remove to a platter. 2. Insert half of the garlic into the ham using a knife. Place ham back in pot of water and add the rest of the garlic, all the herbs and the tomatoes. Bring to a boil. 3. Bake in oven for 3 hours, basting occasionally. Cover with aluminum foil if ham browns too quickly. Remove ham from pot when cooked. 4. Reduce remaining liquid over medium fire. Stir in honey, zest and juice of lemon and fennel seeds. Use as glaze for ham. Related post/s: Where to get lavender honey

This is my basic recipe for making meatballs at home using either ground pork, beef or lamb. Depending on the dish I am using the meatballs for, I add breadcrumbs and an egg to make sure they remain intact when added. For more tagine and stew dishes, I skip both, substitute the nutmeg for cumin and usually add some mint. Ingredients: 1 pound lean ground meat 1/4 cup of parsley, finely chopped 2 garlic cloves, minced 1 tbsp plain dried breadcrumbs 1 large egg 1/8 tsp ground nutmeg salt, pepper 1. Combine and mix all the ingredients in a large bowl. Form golf-sized balls with your hands using some breadcrumbs to help them stick together. 2. Arrange on a baking sheet and freeze for an hour. Once frozen, transfer to a re-sealable bag. Related post/s: Swedish meatballs Meatballs with pomegranate molasses

101 Second Avenue off 6th Street 212/253.7848 about $125 for two, with two drinks, without tip ♥ ♥ ♥ Updated, 2006: Makimono is now closed I love my sushi and I've had my fair share from New York City's finest, but at the end of the day, otoro is still otoro and whether $12 a piece is worth it, a restaurant has to be able to support that price with other items as enticing. At Makimono, the tuna belly melted like butter and awakened the back of my throat. The uni was divine and so were the mackerel, the fluke and even the fishier sardine. The trio tartare of salmon, yellowfin and big eye tuna were all delicious and delicate even with the fried lotus root. The restaurant's makimonos, rolls named after the traditional Japanese hand scrolls given as gifts, were ironically the least interesting of all, even with avocados and snow crabs.

I love roasting ducks just so I can save the duck fat afterwards. The collected duck fat is great for roasting Brussels sprouts or potatoes and using it as dressing on some bitter greens like endives and watercress. Just transfer it to a ramekin, cover with plastic wrap and store in the freezer until ready to use. Ingredients: 1 whole fresh duck, excess fat trimmed, giblets removed For blueberry sauce: 2 cups blueberries 1 Granny Smith apple, peeled, quarted, cored, finely chopped 1/2 of a white onion, finely chopped 1/2 cup brown sugar 1/4 cup white sugar 2 pcs whole star anise grated zest of 1 lime grated zest of 1 orange 1/2 cup white wine vinegar 1. Heat oven at 325º. Place duck on a rack of a roasting pan to drain fat. Bake uncovered for 3 hours, periodically draining off collected fat in pan. Raise heat to 400º and roast an additional 30 minutes for crispy skin. 2. Make the blueberry sauce while roasting the duck. In a small saucepan, put all the ingredients together and simmer over low heat. It should be thick but leave some of the fruit chunks for more texture. Adjust the taste by adding sugar and white wine vinegar alternately. 3. To serve, remove ducks from the oven and cut away meat from the rib cage on a carving board, discarding bones.

A staple of Chinese takeouts, sesame noodles is an easy, protein-rich dish that can be both spicy and sweet. The key is using Skippy's smooth peanut butter so as not to complicate the recipe and not use any more sugar since peanut butter off the supermarket shelves is already too sweet. I used soba noodles here because I already have them, but use Chinese egg noodles for more authenticity. Ingredients: soba noodles a handful of string beans, julienned 1 red bell pepper, julienned 1/2 cup Skippy's smooth peanut butter 1 garlic clove, minced 1/4 cup soy sauce 1/4 cup rice vinegar 2 tbsps sesame oil salt 1. Cook soba noodles in boiling water for about 5 minutes. When done, drain and fluff with a fork to keep the noodles from sticking together. Toss noodles with the vegetables. 2. In a blender, purée the rest of the ingredients. Stir in some warm water to liquify the dressing. Pour dressing over noodles and vegetables. Toss to coat.

This recipe calls for clarified butter. In a small pan, melt a few sticks of butter over low heat. Brown the butter until there is no more sizzle, but remove from heat to avoid burning it. Using a cheesecloth, strain to remove the burnt sediments. Transfer to a ramekin and put inside the fridge to solidify. You can use regular butter if you think that's too much work. Make sure it's good quality butter, though, like Lurpak. Ingredients: Brussels sprouts, halved 3 tbsps butter salt, pepper 1. In a Dutch oven, brown butter over medium heat. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Add sprouts when butter is hot and cook until browned on both sides. Related post/s: Brussels sprouts without butter

435 Hudson Street between Leroy and Morton 212/647.9196 about $125 for two, with two drinks, without tip ♥ ♥ Our Ethan Hawke lookalike waiter at EN Japanese Brasserie seemed nervous, stuttering whenever he had to answer a question; maybe we asked too many questions. The cocktails we ordered as soon as we were seated took fifteen minutes to come and when the boy's bourbon was served without my lychee martini, he tried to explain in so many words why. But the restaurant is known for its yuba, or homemade tofu, not for its waiters, and if you come at the right time, you can catch the next fresh batch that's scheduled to be made. What impressed me was their otoro, or the belly, the most expensive part of a tuna fish. We had them two ways, sashimi and seared, and they were both exquisite. The sashimi was magnificent, like butter melting in your mouth, while the seared otoro was served in garlic-soy and tasted like perfect slabs of steak. After an uni sashimi, we asked for a recommended light palate cleanser. A burdock root salad was served which I thought was too heavy to be eaten in between dishes. For dessert, we ordered the yuba sorbet but a souffle came instead. Our waiter apologized but it was never comped from our bill. Space is hard to find in New York City, but EN has plenty of it. An inexperienced waiter can ruin a visit but EN holds its own with more pluses than minuses. High ceilings, dark wooden carvings and twigs of cherry blossoms take you away from the big city as you walk past the heavy curtains. The entire staff harmoniously greets every customer out loud in Japanese as soon as they come in and that alone can transport anyone to Shinjuku.

214 East 10th Street between First and Second Avenues 212/477.7030 about $30 for two, with two drinks, without tip ♥ ♥ While Rai Rai Ken reminds me of the Japanese movie Tampopo, it is my quick trip to Tokyo a few years ago that always comes flooding back whenever I enter the shop for a simple bowl of ramen. Separating the curtain at the door, I immediately get transported back to winter Japan. Rai Rai Ken's narrow space and wooden bar remind me of cold cheeks and frozen hands after my usual bike commute through the suburbs of Tokyo. There is a simple menu of three kinds of ramen bowls: shoyu, a soy sauce-based broth, shio, seafood-based and miso, made of soy beans, all served with bamboo shoots, spinach, roast pork, nori or roasted seaweed and scallions, and then topped with the ever-so Japanese pink fish cake. Long strands of ramen noodles complete the package that require pulling, twirling and slurping. You can order fried vegetables and pork gyoza, or dumplings on the side, as well as edamame, or boiled soy beans, and white rice. Sapporo and Kirin beer overflow for those who want to extend their stay. In New York City, the temperature does not drop as low as it does in Japan during the winter months, but it is nonetheless cold. It is so cold only an imaginary trip back to Japan at Rai Rai Ken can warm me up.

This recipe is from the All-Star Thanksgiving 2004 show on FoodTV demonstrated by Tyler Florence. Getting the flesh of the artichoke is a lot of work, so a Filipino father is necessary, but it's also a wonderful Thanksgiving dish that doesn't involve any turkey. Your artichokes should look like this after trimming them to expose the light green flesh. The white hairs and the pink leaves should be scooped out and discarded after simmering in the flavorful broth. They are easier and cleaner to remove cooked than raw. You need 8 artichokes for this recipe to have enough by the time you clean them out. Ingredients: 8 artichokes, trimmed down and halved 2 large pork sausages 1/2 cup chicken stock sage leaves 2 shallots, minced 4 garlic cloves, minced the other half of the lemon, thinly sliced 2 tbsps unsalted butter salt, pepper, olive oil For the flavorful broth: 1/4 cup of dry white wine 2 quarts of water a handful of fresh parsley 4 cloves of garlic, crushed 2 bay leaves half a lemon salt, pepper 1. Bring the flavorful broth to a simmer in a large pot. Add the artichokes, cover the pot over medium heat for a little less than 20 minutes, until there is no resistance when a knife is inserted into the base of the artichokes. 2. Spoon out the artichokes carefully and try to leave the halves intact for a better presentation. Carefully scoop out the hairy choke from the center and discard. 3. In a hot, deep skillet, pour some olive oil and brown and cook the sausages for about 10 minutes. Remove and set aside. Using the same skillet, add a drizzle of olive oil to the pan and cook the sage leaves until fragrant. Add shallots, garlic and lemon slices and cook for another 2 minutes. Add chicken stock, bring to a simmer and emulsify with butter and a little bit more oil until reduced and thickened. 4. Return artichokes and sausages in the pan and cook over low heat for a few minutes to warm them up. Spoon out and serve by topping with leftover parsley.

Pumpkins are everywhere come Halloween time and my mother always takes one home from her kindergarten school trip. Ah, autumn. If you don't want to spend the extra effort to bake, feel free to use Duncan Hines Moist Deluxe Butter Recipe Golden mix and follow their instructions on the box instead of using your own flour, baking soda and baking powder. Ingredients: 3 cups fresh pumpkin, shredded 1 cup pumpkin seeds, toasted 2 cups flour 1 tsp baking soda 1/4 tsp baking powder 3 eggs 2 tsps cinnamon 2 tsps nutmeg half a stick of butter, melted in the microwave 1 1/2 cups sugar 3/4 cup vegetable oil 1/2 tsp salt 1. Preheat oven to 350é while you shred the pumpkin meat. 2. Combine flour, baking soda, baking powder, cinnamon, nutmeg and salt in a large bowl. In a separate bowl, mix sugar, oil and eggs. 3. Combine both mixtures and fold in the pumpkin meat. Pour into a baking pan coated with butter and a little flour. Bake until golden brown. Test the middle section with a toothpick until it comes out clean. 4. While baking, toast pumpkin seeds in a hot skillet with a sprinkle of salt. Sprinkle on top of the pumpkin bread before it completely sets.

63 Bedford Street on Morton 212/929-3499 about $150 for two, with two drinks, without tip ♥ ♥ I always write about eating at Snack, my favorite Greek spot, so I decided to try its new sister restaurant, Snack Taverna on Bedford. It has a more grown-up menu with some French influences and the ambiance is a lot less casual than its counterpart. I later learned that its chef, John Fraser, cooked at The French Laundry in Napa for almost three years. I had my first excellent dinner of 2004 at Snack Taverna. I started with the veal cheeks served with hostas, or giboshi to the Japanese, a green plant that could be as tender as an asparagus. The loukaniko, a Greek hot sausage with oh-so-savory fennel and diced pear was excellent, I almost forgot about my crispy lamb's tongue. We shared a braised lamb shoulder with bitter dandelions and a small serving of the monkfish. A mix of Cabernet and Merlot from Greece was the perfect match. At Snack Taverna, the meals are better than the desserts, but I couldn't resist the chocolate souffle with raspberry sauce even though our waiter warned us about the fifteen-minute wait. He served us a complementary piece of baklava for being patient. Related post/s: For a more casual night out, try Snack

402 West 43rd Street off Ninth Avenue 212/564.7272 about $700 for four, with a lot of drinks, with tip ♥ ♥ ♥ Some friends I met while traveling in Ireland were in town. Remembering how much we all liked our seafood while we were traveling, I booked a table for four at Esca. At least two people are required to order the tasting menu per table, so my companions opted for that while I ordered the crudo appetizer, or tasting portions of raw seafood: uni served on its shell, an oyster, scallops with chervil, razor clams with chilis and hamachi with scallions. I've never had seafood worshipped this way. I salivated over the carpaccio yellowfin tuna and the linguine with mahogany clams and pancetta. The shrimps with caper and thyme vinaigrette, the squid-ink spaghetti with cuttlefish and the striped bass with caramelized apples were all delicious. The Maine halibut was a little bland if not eaten with the burdock root and black trumpet mushrooms, but the scallops were perfectly seared. I loved the warm fruit turnover and the raspberry ice cream for dessert. Unfortunately, I could not find room in my stomach to accommodate the creme brulee. There was no Guiness beer but there were plenty of other wee-drinks: a bottle of Marchese di Gresy, another bottle of Moscato D'Asti and yet another bottle from Piemonte for dessert. Champagne, vodka and gin and tonics were also ordered several times before the main courses were served. Esca, which means bait in Italian, is a great place for groups-just don't bring Irish friends who can outdrink you. Related post/s: It's not surprising that Esca includes Mario Batali and Joseph Bastianich Seafood worship?

Di Palo's in New York City sells different kinds of pasta. In the fall, I like to pick up their pumpkin ravioli and buy mushrooms from the farmers' market to match. Maitake mushrooms, also called hen of the woods mushrooms, are capless and look more like a cluster of wings. They're very fragrant and can get expensive when they're in season. You can substitute shiitake mushrooms if you don't have access to them. Ingredients: 1 package of pumpkin ravioli a few ounces of maitake mushrooms 3 garlic cloves, minced half a stick of butter salt, ground white pepper 1. Add ravioli in salted boiling water. Remove and drain after 10 minutes. Set aside. 2. In a skillet, sauté garlic in butter until light brown. Add mushrooms until tender. Serve along with the ravioli.

110 Waverly Place between MacDougal and Sixth 212/777.0303 about $200 for two, with a few drinks, with tip ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ Our first time at Babbo, we went all out, asked questions about never-heard words written on the menu (braciole! francobolli! scottadita!) and picked out a bottle of red wine to match. I started with spicy lamb tartare with mint crostini and a quail egg in the middle. It killed me. The boy chose the grilled octopus with \"borlotti marinati\" and spicy limoncello vinaigrette. You know how octopus can be chewy sometimes even in the best Japanese restaurants? This was perfectly tender. For primi, I had the one-pound lobster with spicy budding chives, sweet garlic and what seemed to be four pounds of spaghettini. The boy opted for beef cheek ravioli with crushed squab liver and black truffles. I was so full after all that, sharing the secondi became a good call: guinea hen braciole with favas and pecorino. Ufortunately, we had to draw the line on desserts. There was just no way I could have squeezed in another bite but our waiter gave us complementary cookies anyway. On our second visit, we managed to control ourselves. We decided to share a lot of the offal starters since we knew the pasta dishes were too much for us. We finished the night with four of the best dishes we've eaten in our lives: Warm lamb's tongue vinaigrette with chanterelles, pecorino Toscano and a 3-minute egg Calf's brain \"Francobolli\" with lemon and sage Goose liver ravioli with balsamic vinegar and brown butter Fennel-dusted sweetbreads with sweet and sour onions, duck bacon and membrillo vinegar Sharing the appetizers was definitely the way to go. It allowed us to get a better sense of the Mario Batali behind Babbo.

This is one of my favorite salads. The yellow bell pepper adds a sweetness to it while the portobello mushrooms make it beefier. I don't have a grill outside my apartment-I don't have an outside!-so I use the stovetop and hold the bell pepper using heat-resistant tongs. You can also broil the bell peppers until all sides are dark brown. Place the broiled peppers in a brown paper bag, close and let steam for about 15 minutes. The skin removes easily after this process. Ingredients: fresh portobello mushrooms, brushed off dirt using paper towel 2 yellow bell peppers, julienned mixed greens, thoroughly washed, patted dry 2 tomatoes, chopped 1 medium red onion, chopped a drizzle of balsamic vinegar salt, pepper, olive oil 1. Grill yellow bell peppers until slightly black. Let them cool down before slicing. 2. Drizzle olive oil on portobello mushrooms and put in the broiler until soft. Let them cool down before slicing as well. 3. In a large salad bowl, toss all ingredients together and season with salt and pepper.

Taleggio, a very rich and semi-soft cheese made from whole cow's milk, has a distinct smell. When I saw this recipe in The New York Times, I knew it would be more fragrant with earthy mushrooms. It's a great autumn recipe if you can afford some truffles or chantarelles in season. Otherwise, shiitake mushrooms will do. Ingredients: 1 medium-sized deep-dish pie crust shell Taleggio cheese, rinds removed, thinly sliced a few ounces of shiitake mushrooms, sliced and stems discarded 1 tbsp cumin seeds 1 small shallot, finely chopped 2 tbsps crème fraîche salt, ground white pepper, olive oil 1. Preheat oven to 350º and bake pie shell for about 10 minutes. 2. While baking, sauté cumin, shallots and mushrooms in hot olive oil until mushrooms are starting to brown. Season with salt and pepper. 3. Let the pie shell cool and then spread crème fraîche and cover with the cooked shallots and mushrooms. Top with Taleggio. Bake in oven for about 15 minutes until cheese melts.

A lamb steak is my fallback dinner when my appetite requires a big, sturdy meal but I'm too lazy to cook. A glass, or two, of red wine completes this dish. Ingredients: 2 lamb steaks salt, pepper, olive oil 1. Preheat oven to 350º. Rub with salt and pepper. Let them sit. 2. Using a hot Dutch oven, heat some olive oil and brown both sides of the lamb steaks. 3. Using a shallow baking pan covered in aluminum foil to catch excess fat, cook steaks on a rack until medium-rare.

20 Elizabeth Street between Canal and Bayard 212/964.5256 about $60 for two, without drinks, without tip ♥ ♥ You can't miss Jing Fong with its shopping mall-style escalators. Sunday is the best day to go for dim sum to experience just one Chinese tradition in the middle of Elizabeth Street. There's a lady at the bottom of the escalators who screams into a microphone to call out people's parties. Upstairs is like a madhouse bingo hall. A true red and gold banquet awaits guests and round tables are shared with strangers. Waiters push rolling food carts around so you can stop them and peek at the small dim sum dishes. A lot of them don't speak English; they just tell you the Chinese word for a dish over and over, hoping you'd back down and stop asking. My only advice is to try whatever looks interesting and skip the mixed fried rice you usually end up getting from a Chinese takeout. I never know the names of my favorite dishes but I go for a lot of shumais and dumplings when I'm with friends who just want the familiar, or else I go for chicken feet and snails when I'm with dim sum regulars. There is also a long table up front so you can pick other hot dishes not available in the rolling carts. If you feel more comfortable ordering from an English menu, they have it available for dishes served in larger portions.

I love the bibimbap, or mixed meal, which is a large bowl of rice topped with different kinds of root vegetables, shredded beef and fried egg, all brought together with gochujang or chili pepper paste. It can be served either hot or cold. I prefer it hot because I love watching the egg cook on top of the newly-cooked rice. My tongue burns every time I try to eat the first few spoonfuls but I can't help myself from digging in. Peasant food has never been this good.

142 Mercer Street on Prince 212/431.7676 about $150 for two, with two drinks, with tip ♥ ♥ ♥ There are nights in New York City when you become thankful for the people you know. I was very thankful this one summer night when the manager and sommelier of Lure invited a friend of mine to a menu tasting before their grand opening. I was even more thankful when my friend asked me to tag along. Lure is the latest restaurant to occupy the coveted space under the Prada store in SoHo, replacing the mediocre, orange-themed Canteen. The yacht setting of the restaurant is new and very sleek, even people peeked and waved at us through the portholes from street-level. There are intimate booths with white leather seats and less private tables for smaller groups. The floor is immaculately shiny to mimic a ship's deck. In the back is the raw and shellfish bar with the freshest sea creatures waiting to be eaten. The design of the space is so well done that even if you do not like maritime decor, you'll fall in love with Lure. Separate rooms are available to rent if you want to throw a private party. With a bottle of Burgundy, we had the following: 1. Arctic Char, Trout Roe, Creamy Horseradish and Dill 2. Coho Salmon, Pickled Japanese Cucumbers and Basil-Soy Tea 3. Toro, Fresh Wasabi and Black Olive Oil 4. Sea Scallops, Grated Scallion, Radish and Ginger Marinade 5. Black Sea Bass, Plum Wine Vinegar Gelee, Julienned Ginger and Jicama 6. Fluke, Cherry Tomatoes, Shallot 7. Yellowfin Tuna, Pickled Chilis, Olive Oil Brulee 8. six pieces of Blue Point Oysters 9. six pieces of Malpeque Oysters 10. Clam Chowder with Smoked Bacon 11. Grilled Swordfish, Soy-Ginger Marinade, Tomato Salad 12. Steamed Black Cod, Sake, Miso, Mushrooms 13. Crab Cakes with Mango, Yuzu and Fennel 14. Tempura Shrimp, Preserved Blackbean Mayonnaise and Lime 15. Peach Crisp 16. Warm Chocolate Cake

I love it when tomatoes are in season. You just know it's summer when the farmers' market starts selling them in all sizes. I saw this recipe from the Best Book of Greek Cookery and I just had to try it. In lieue of dried currants, I used Sunmaid raisins. Not only are they pretty as appetizers, they taste good, too. Ingredients: 6 medium-sized tomatoes 1 small red onion, finely chopped 1 cup uncooked rice 1/4 cup dried currants 2 tbsp pine nuts, toasted 2 tbsp mint leaves, chopped 2 tbsp sugar 1/4 cup dry bread crumbs salt, pepper, olive oil 1. Cut a thin slice off the tops of the tomatoes and set aside. Scoop out tomato pulp, chop and drain to a bowl. Sprinkle inside of tomatoes with sugar. 2. Heat olive oil in a skillet. Cook onions until soft. Add rice, stir and cook for 15 minutes. Add currants, pine nuts, mint and half of the tomato pulp with 1/4 cup of water. Season with salt and pepper. Cover and simmer for 10 minutes. 3. Preheat oven to 300º. Pureé remaining tomato pulp and spread on the bottom of a shallow baking dish. The tomatoes should not have too much space between them. 4. Spoon rice mixture into tomatoes. Replace tops. Drizzle olive oil over each tomato and sprinkle with bread crumbs. Bake for 1 1/2 hours. Related post/s: Best Book of Greek Cookery at Amazon.com

I like cold vegetable soups. They're great in the summer as a starter. This is especially creamy because of the potatoes, but the sour cream makes it a little tangy. Ingredients: half a head of Boston lettuce, coarsely chopped 3 potatoes, peeled, diced 1 cucumber, peeled, diced 4 scallions, white part only, finely chopped 1/2 cup sour cream 4 cups chicken stock 2 tbsps butter chives salt 1. Melt butter in a large saucepan and sauté scallions until soft. Add potatoes, stir well, then add stock. Bring to a boil then reduce heat to simmer until potatoes are soft, about 15 minutes. 2. Add lettuce to the pan and stir until wilted. Remove from heat and allow it to cool until no longer steaming. 3. Using a blender and working in batches, pureé soup until it's smooth. Using the blender's stir function, add sour cream and salt as needed. 4. To serve, ladle in small bowls and sprinkle wtih chives and cucumber \"croutons.\" You can serve it chilled or at room temperature. Related post/s: Good ol' chicken stock

For a cheap cut of lamb, the breast is particularly rich with a strong taste. Breast meat is moist and fatty and it braises well with vegetables. I've watched the boy cook this dish so many times that I thought it was about time I make my own. Ingredients: For Marinade: 2 pounds of breast of lamb with bones 2 sprigs of fresh thyme 2 sprigs of fresh rosemary 1 tbsp fennel seeds 1 bunch of flat-leaf parsley, roughly chopped half a bunch of scallions, roughly chopped 5 cloves of garlic, peeled, finely chopped 2 cups of red Zinfandel salt, pepper For Braising: 2 tbsps whiskey beef broth 2 medium red onions, finely chopped 1 bag of baby carrots 1 bag of green peas 4 medium white baby potatoes, quartered 1 small can of tomato paste olive oil 1. Let lamb sit in marinade for a few hours to absorb flavor. Save the juice. 2. When ready to cook, heat the oil in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Brown the lamb on both sides. Remove to a plate and set aside. 3. Pour off all but 2 tbsps of the fat from the pot. Add the onion, carrots and potatoes to the pot and reduce the heat to medium-low. Cover and cook, stirring often, until the vegetables soften, about 5 minutes. 4. Stir in some of the marinade with the whiskey and the broth and bring to a boil over high heat, scraping off the browned bits on the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. 5. Return the lamb with its juices to the pot and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the marinade to a thicker consistency and until lamb is soft. 6. Add the tomato paste and peas. Simmer in low heat until all vegetables are soft.

19 East 49th Street on Madison Avenue 212/758.2700 about $480 for four omakases, with a few drinks, with tip ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ There are two Sushidens in New York City, one on Sixth Avenue and this one on Madison. Whichever branch you pick, make sure you ask to be seated at the bar so you can talk to your chef and get the chance to eat fish that's not on the menu. One of the most memorable experiences I had at Sushiden was when our chef brought out some fresh shrimp, disassembled the heads, and used tweezers to pick the brain. He put all the gray and orange matter on top of Japanese mackerel with the shrimp body and made sushi. When we were done bowing in appreciation and glee, the chef deep-fried the shrimp head shells and offered them to us to snack on while we waited for the next course. No part of the shrimp was wasted. Whenever I go to a sushi restaurant, I always start off with the uni, or the sea urchin. If it's excellent, then I know the place will have more of the good stuff coming. At Sushiden, after the uni, the chef always asks me what I want next and that's when I tell him that I'll eat whatever he wants me to taste. The chefs will only ask you if you're allergic to anything, and if that's a negative, you will sit for the next hour eating fresh fish after fresh fish that melts in your mouth like butter.

My quest to impress the Korean brood continues... I did not include measurements in this kimchi recipe because the ingredients must be measured in equal parts according to how much vegetables you are using. If you don't have access to daikon radish, you can use what Americans call turnips. Kimchi is always present on Korean tables, so serve them on the side with beef bulgogi or kalbi. Ingredients: Napa cabbage, washed thoroughly, chopped Romaine lettuce, washed thoroughly, chopped daikon radish, peeled, cubed a knob of ginger, peeled, chopped garlic cloves, peeled scallions, thinly chopped red pepper flakes sesame oil sesame seeds, toasted 1. Using a mortar and pestle, ground garlic and ginger into a paste. Using disposable gloves, wipe every cabbage and lettuce leaf with the garlic and ginger paste. 2. Transfer to a large mixing bowl and toss in the rest of the ingredients. Mix to combine everything well. 3. Stuff and fill a pickling jar with the kimchi mixture. Seal and keep in the fridge to ferment. Check after a week to adjust taste. Begin serving after a week.

Spanakopita, Greek Spinach Triangles

Snack's spinach triangles, or spanakopita, is one of my favorites things to eat in New York City. Filo, or phyllo, which means \"leaf\" in Greek, are tissue paper-thin like sheets of dough made from flour. They burn easily so keep the oven temperature at less than 300º when baking so that they don't turn brown before the spinach mixture inside is cooked. When I made my own at home, I realized that it's easier to use frozen spinach than the fresh ones and that it's less work to make them in pie form, rather than in triangles. I've included the two recipes below. Ingredients: 2 bunches of spinach, hard stalks removed, thoroughly washed feta cheese, crumbled filo pastry, gently unrolled and thawed in the fridge overnight 1 bunch scallion, chopped 1/4 cup of flat-leaf parsley, finely chopped 2 eggs, lightly beaten 1 cup stick of butter, melted for a few seconds using the microwave salt, pepper, olive oil 1. Preheat oven to 275º and brush a baking sheet with some of the melted butter. 2. Heat 1 tbsp of olive oil in a large skillet and sauté half of the spinach until it wilts. Remove and squeeze out excess liquid from the spinach using a paper towel and chop roughly. Repeat for the other half with another 1 tbsp of olive oil. 3. Sauté scallions until soft in the same skillet. Return the spinach with the parsley and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Cook for about 3 minutes in low heat then remove from heat. Stir in the feta and the egg to moisten the spinach mixture. 4. Remove the filo dough from the fridge to a flat surface and keep it covered with a moist towel to keep the dough from getting brittle. Cut the filo in 3-by-11-inch strips and recover with the damp towel. 5. Brush a strip of filo with melted butter and place a spoonful of the spinach mixture at the end of the strip. Fold the end over to form a triangle and continue to fold the strip in triangles, like folding a flag. Keep your triangles covered with another damp towel until ready to bake all of them. 6. Brush the triangles lightly with butter and bake for 20 to 25 minutes until golden brown and crisp. If you want to make spinach pie instead, follow these instructions after #3 above: 4. Remove the filo dough from the fridge to a flat surface and keep it covered with a moist towel to keep the dough from getting brittle. Cut the filo to fit the shape of your baking dish and recover with your damp towel. 5. Brush glass baking dish with melted butter and lay out a couple of filo sheets on the bottom. Distribute spinach mixture. Add a few more sheets of filo on top, coating each with butter, until you have several layers and you are out of spinach. 6. Bake for 30 minutes until golden brown and crisp. Related post/s: Snack

Sparky's is a very good reason to visit the borough because it offers the best hot dogs, the best relish, the best chili, the best ketchup, the best mustard and the best buns.

13 West 54th Street 212/307.7311 about $300 for three, with a few drinks, without tip ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ Updated, 2006: Aquavit has moved down the block at 65 East 55th Street between Park and Madison Avenues, 212/593.0287 I had one of the most surreal dining experiences at Aquavit with two of my friends. It was herring week in New York City and we were seated at the best table in the house, facing their cascading waterfalls, at the right time. The service was extraordinary; two waiters were looking after our needs and another one always made sure we were having a good time. Our reservation was at 8pm, which is prime dining time, but we were never rushed. We stayed until 11:30pm. The chef and co-owner, Marcus Samuelsson, is the youngest chef ever to receive a three-star restaurant review from food critic Ruth Reichl. The James Beard Foundation has also awarded him \"Rising Star Chef\" in 1999 and \"Best New Chef in New York City\" in 2003. I was so impressed that he used kalamansi to make sorbet because it's the Filipino version of limes. The trio of sweetbreads, pork sausages and lobster was an odd combination but it spelled decadence all over. Just like his eclectic food creations for this Scandinavian-owned restaurant, he also has a very interesting background. He's Ethiopian and was adopted by a Swedish couple and has apprenticed in Sweden, Switzerland and Austria. With a bottle of Gigondas, we each went for the three-course prix fixe. Between the three of us tasting each other's food, it was like having nine courses, plus the three complementary tasting plates the chef sent up. Here's a run-down of our meal: 1. Lobster roll with pistachio and lemon yogurt, salmon roe and homemade ginger ale 2. Herring Plate served with Aquavit and Carlsberg beer 3. Squab with potato purée and pearl onions 4. Konbu cured duck and braised leg with nut salad, kasha, bok choy, water chestnuts and coconut-red beet sauce 5. Smoked dry-aged New York Strip with Kobe tongue, lily bulb salad and Japanese potato in bone marrow emulsion 6. Trio: sweetbreads, pork sausage and lobster 7. Peanut butter parfait, sautéed banana and kalamansi sorbet 8. Arctic Circle: goat cheese parfait, blueberry sorbet and honey tuile 9. Warm chocolate with orange creamsicle and citrus salad

2 Park Avenue at 32nd Street 212/725.8585 about $125 for two, with two drinks, without tip ♥ ♥ Known for its cheese selections, I took advantage of Restaurant Week and was greatly disappointed with the Artisanal discounted menu. Who wants to be tied down with a choice of either hanger steak or salmon? Four of us ended up ordering from the regular menu anyway and spending $70 each. The crispy skate wing was really good, served with blood orange a la Grenobloise and cauliflower. I regretted not picking one of the seafood choices because my lamb cassoulet with white beans wasn't the best version I've tasted. My friends' cod special and wild mushroom risotto with butternut squash seemed like more interesting. At least my frisée salad provided me with some comfort. Though we all enjoyed the ritual involved in our prosciutto and cheese fondue, I will most likely stick with the cheese flight without any dipping involved next time. I like my French bistro food, but I can name a handful of other places in the city that would have a more robust selection.

The boy likes his coleslaw but I can't stand mayonnaise. I wanted to make a batch for him without going the KFC route. I used two kinds of cabbages for color. The purple cabbage, also known as red cabbage, looked very pretty against the yellow bell pepper. A sprinkle of scallions provided some green and the tomatoes a burst of orange. I just used a dollop of light mayonnaise here to keep me from being grossed out. If you don't want to splurge on truffled vinegar, you can use cider vinegar instead. Ingredients: a quarter head of green cabbage, shredded a quarter head of purple cabbage, shredded 1 yellow bell pepper, julienned 3 stalks to scallions, chopped half a pint of grape tomatoes, halved fresh basil leaves 1 tbsp of light mayonnaise a jig of truffled vinegar, salt, pepper 1. In a bowl, sprinkle salt over shredded cabbage. Set aside for about an hour. Squeeze cabbage with paper towel to remove water. 2. Toss cabbage with the remaining vegetables. 3. In a separate bowl, whisk mayo with vinegar and season with salt and pepper. Pour over salad. Related post/s: Dare to serve this coleslaw with fried chicken?

I like the ritual of meeting friends for a weekend brunch but I'm usually disappointed with the menu selections. Unless I'm meeting something at Barney Greengrass in New York City, I'd rather cook my own brunch feast. Ingredients: 5 large eggs 1 large tomato, sliced thinly 1 bunch baby spinach, thoroughly washed, coarsely chopped 1 medium red onion, diced 1 tbsp fresh thyme 1/4 cup heavy cream salt, pepper, olive oil 1. Preheat oven to 400º. In the meantime, heat olive oil in a large nonstick and oven-proof skillet and sauté onions and thyme. Add spinach and cook until wilted. Season with salt and pepper. 2. In a medium bowl, whisk eggs with milk and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Pour over the vegetables, gently lifting them to let egg mixture coat the bottom of the skillet. Arrange tomatoes on top. Cook until the sides are a little toasted but the top still runny. 3. Tranfer to oven and cook until the center is firm and tomatoes are browned, about 15 minutes. To serve, loosen with a heatproof spatula.

Bulgogi in Korean literally means \"fire beef.\" Thinly sliced sirloin steak is marinated in a soy sauce mixture before frying. It is usually served with Boston lettuce leaves, which the Koreans also call ssam, so that you can fill a lettuce leaf with some meat, some rice, a little bit of kimchi, or Korean pickles, and wrap it in a bundle. Ingredients: 1 1/2 pounds sirloin steak, thinly sliced 1/4 cup soy sauce 1 tbsp of hot chili sesame oil 2 tbsps brown sugar 6 garlic cloves, minced 1 small knob ginger, peeled, grated 2 large red onions, thinly sliced 1 green bell pepper, julienned Boston lettuce leaves vegetable oil 1. Prepare marinade while thawing the beef. In a bowl, whisk together soy sauce, sesame oil, sugar, garlic and ginger. Divide marinade in two. In half of the marinade, toss half of the onions and bell pepper and set aside to use as dipping sauce. Marinate the beef before it completely thaws out in the other half. Let sit for a couple of hours, covered. 2. Over medium-high heat, pour oil in a large non-stick skillet. Add onions and bell peppers until onions are soft. Transfer to a plate and wipe skillet clean with a paper towel. 3. Cook the beef in small batches, turning often, until browned. Return the cooked onions and bell peppers and stir-fry with the beef. Serve with Boston lettuce leaves.

The boy was craving fried chicken when I visited him in Vermont. In the 'burbs however, you really can't get a good fried chicken without going to one of the fast food chains so we made our own. If you've never marinated chicken in buttermilk before, you'll notice that the cooked meat is buttery because of it. Be patient when frying; you want to make sure that the chicken is also cooked inside. We didn't even get the chance to sit down to eat the finished product. As soon as the fried chicken pieces were cool enough to handle, we devoured them standing up. Ingredients: chicken legs and breasts 2 cups of buttermilk 1 cup of flour a dash of cayenne pepper frying oil enough to sink chicken half way salt, pepper 1. In a large Tupperware with cover, marinate chicken in buttermilk from 2 to 24 hours. 2. Before frying, combine flour, salt, pepper and cayenne and coat chicken. Place them on top of a wire rack until ready to fry. 3. In a deep sauce pot, heat oil to 350º and slowly drop chicken pieces. Fry until golden brown on all sides. Use tongs to make sure they are cooking evenly on both sides. Do not cover. Remove each chicken to the same wire rack when cooked. Related post/s: Roasted sweet potatoes

This is a great recipe from epicurious.com. It's time-consuming but the end product is so satisfying. If you can't find dried herbes de Provence, you can make your own with some dried basil, dried thyme and fennel seeds. A full-bodied Cabernet will also do if you don't have a red Zinfandel. The original recipe called for Niçoise black olives but I just picked up a bottle of regular black olives I found in the store. Ingredients: 4 pounds meaty beef short ribs 1 medium carrot, finely chopped 1 package of baby carrots 3 celery stalks, finely chopped 1 large red onion, finely chopped 1/2 cup pitted black olives 1 bulb garlic, peeled 2 tbsps all-purpose flour 1 tbsp herbes de Provence 2 cups red Zinfandel 2 cups beef broth 1 14.5-ounce can of diced tomatoes with juice 1 bay leaf flat-leaf parsley, finely chopped olive oil 1. Preheat oven to 300º. Heat the oil in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Season the short ribs with the salt and pepper. In batches and without crowding, add the short ribs to the pot and cook, turning occasionally, until browned on all sides, about 8 minutes. Using tongs, transfer the ribs to a platter. 2. Pour off all but 2 tbsps of the fat from the pot. Add the onion, chopped carrots and celery to the pot and reduce the heat to medium-low. Cover and cook, stirring ocassionally, until the vegetables are softened, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic, herbs and flour, and cook for about a minute. 3. Stir in the wine and the broth and bring to a boil over high heat, scraping off the browned bits on the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Add the tomatoes and bay leaf. Return the short ribs with their juice to the pot and bring to a boil over high heat. 4. Cover tightly, transfer to the oven, and braise, stirring occasionally to change the position of the ribs, until the meat is falling-off-the-bone tender, about 2 1/2 hours. During the last 15 minutes, add the baby carrots. 5. Transfer the short ribs to a deep serving platter and tent with aluminum foil to keep warm. Skim off the fat from the surface of the cooking liquid and discard the bay leaf. Bring to a boil over high heat and cook until the liquid is reduced to your desired sauce consistency, about 10 minutes. 6. Add the olives and cook to heat them through, about 3 minutes. Season the sauce with salt and pepper. 7. Spoon the sauce with the carrots over the ribs and sprinkle with the parsley before serving.

This recipe came from Jonathan Reynolds of The New York Times Sunday magazine. If you don't have veal stock, chicken stock will do. Ingredients: 4 pieces 1 1/4-inch thick center-cut pork chops, bone-in 1/4 cup chopped shallots 1/2 cup dry white wine 3/4 cup veal stock 1/2 cup heavy cream 1 tbsp butter 1 tbsp vegetable oil 1 tbsp Dijon mustard salt, pepper 1. Rub salt and pepper on the pork chops. Melt butter in the oil using a deep skillet over high heat. Add the pork chops and brown them on each side for about 5 minutes. Reduce heat if they brown too quickly. 2. Remove chops to a platter and pour off most of the fat. Add shallots and cook over medium-heat until softened. Add wine and bring to a boil, scraping brown bits off the bottom of the skillet. 3. Stir in the veal stock and return the pork chops to the skillet. Bring the sauce to a simmer, cover and cook chops until tender, about 25 minutes. Remove chops to a warm platter and tent with aluminum foil to keep warm. 4. Raise the heat and boil juices to reduce to half, about 2 minutes. Add cream and boil for another 2 minutes until sauce thickens. Remove the pan from the heat and whisk in mustard. Spoon over sauce over the chops and serve.

Heat oven to 400º. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. 2. Brush cod fillets with butter and wrap each in a two slices of prosciutto, leaving the ends open. Brush with butter again. Bake fish until firm and white for about 20 minutes. 3. In the meantime, heat a large skillet and add oil. Sauté garlic, onion and carrots with a little salt. 4. Using a rice cooker, cook lentils like you cook rice but with an extra 2 cups of water. Add your sautéed vegetables, thyme and bay leaves. 5. Serve cod on a bed of lentils.

I can never ignore a fennel and cheese salad on a menu. It's so easy to make your own version at home. I like to make this salad before I start cooking because it ties me over until the main course is done. The key is to use lemon juice so that the fennel doesn't change color. A good quality Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese is the default but I rather like it with a golden Pecorino. Ingredients: 1 bulb fennel, sliced thinly Pecorino cheese, or any other hard cheese, shaved juice of half of lemon salt, pepper, olive oil 1. In a small bowl, toss fennel with lemon juice. Toss in the rest of the ingredients and transfer to a serving platter. Related post/s: Where to buy good cheese

I'm not a big fan of cabbage unless it's for Korean pickles, or kimchi, so when this recipe from The New York Times called for Savoy cabbage, I used Napa instead because it gets tender faster especially when braised. Ingredients: 2 pounds of beef spareribs, cut into individual ribs, excess fat removed 1 Napa cabbage, chopped 1 cup of dry white wine 4 cloves of garlic, crushed 3 bay leaves 3 dried red chilis salt, pepper, olive oil 1. Heat a big casserole. Add oil. Add garlic and chilis until they sizzle nicely. 2. Add ribs, meat side down and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Brown both sides of the ribs. Remove to a plate. 3. Pour off excess fat and add cabbage. Sprinkle with more salt and pepper. Cook cabbage until slightly brown and then add white wine, stirring to release brown bits stuck to the bottom of the casserole. 4. Return ribs to the pot and adjust heat to simmer slowly. Cover. Cook for at least 45 minutes checking and stirring occasionally to make sure the mixture does not dry out. Add a little water if it starts to; use chicken stock instead if you have some handy.

125 East 17th Street on Irving Place 212/253.2773 about $125 for two, with a few drinks, without tip ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ Jamon is Spanish for ham and Bar Jamon is the most recent translation in the New York City scene. Mario Batali's latest digs is right next to Casa Mono, his fifth restaurant in New York City. The space is good for fifteen couples at most, but more than thirty were inside, even on a Tuesday night. We squeezed ourselves in to eat tapas and drink Spanish wine and new guests jumped to the next stool that freed up. A little jazz and a little Wilco were playing when we were there, but the music was so faint compared to the collective noise of those who had the same idea as we did. With two bottles of Tempranillo, we shared two plates of ham cured for fourteen months. We also got the sardines en escabeche and marinated anchovies with migas de chorizo or sausage crumbs. We snacked on a plate of two kinds of cheeses and enjoyed their bread with some good olive oil. We didn't think we'd stay past 9pm because of the crowd but as soon as we snatched the stools in the back, we ended up staying for two more hours. Bar Jamon is a scene all right, but it's a New York City scene and that you can't pass up.

Oyster mushrooms are incredibly cheap in Chinatown. They're usually white or of a light brown color and they look more like fans than the familiar capped mushrooms. You can add a little cornstarch when making the sauce to thicken it, but I left it out. I prefer thickening the sauce by simmering it until it has the consistency I'm happy with. Ingredients: 1 pound of fresh oyster mushrooms, cleaned and wiped with a paper towel, sliced in smaller pieces half a pound of string beans, destringed, cut in half 1 green bell pepper, sliced 1 bunch spinach, thoroughly washed 3 garlic cloves, minced 1 medium red onion, thinly sliced a small knob of fresh ginger, peeled, thinly sliced 2 tbsps rice wine salt Sauce: 3 1/2 tbsps oyster sauce 1 1/2 tbsps rice wine 1 1/4 tbsps sugar 1/2 tsp sesame oil 2 1/2 tsps canola oil 1. Prepare sauce by combining all ingredients in a small bowl. Set aside. 2. Using a large skillet, add 1 tsp of oil and heat until hot. Add string beans, garlic, onions, rice wine and salt. Toss until beans are tender. Add a little water and cook until dry. Remove from the skillet to a serving plate. 3. Using the same skillet, add another tsp of oil and heat until hot. Sauté garlic, onions and ginger. Add mushrooms and toss with heat-resistant spatula for about 5 minutes. 4. Add the sauce and toss slightly to thicken, stirring constantly to prevent lumps. Serve on top of the beans.

Meatballs are so easy and fun to make even with the least expensive ground pork available from your supermarket. They make this simple soup recipe chunkier and heartier. Ingredients: half a pound of ground pork 2 bunches of watercress, thoroughly washed 1 large carrot, finely chopped 2 stalks of celery, finely chopped chicken stock 1 egg dusting of flour salt, pepper 1. Make the meatballs. Combine ground pork, carrots and celery with a little salt and pepper. Form golf-sized balls with your hands using a little flour to help them stick together. 2. In boiling chicken stock, slowly add your meatballs to cook until they all float. Simmer and add watercress until wilted. Season with salt and pepper. 3. Turn off the heat and slowly whisk in a fresh egg using a fork. Ladle in bowls and serve. Related post/s: Good ol' chicken stock

I watched Jamie Oliver cook this chicken dish on The Naked Chef. It's originally a Ligurian recipe but because my neighborhood supermarket only had Spanish olives with pits, I ended up making my own version. Ingredients: 9 pieces of chicken 2 tbsps of flour 6 cloves of garlic, thinly sliced 1/2 cup of Spanish olives with pits 1/2 cup of white wine 3 plum tomatoes, chopped 5 sprigs of fresh rosemary salt, pepper, olive oil 1. In a large bowl, combine flour with some salt and pepper. Coat chicken. 2. Over medium high heat using a Dutch oven, fry chicken pieces in hot olive oil until golden brown. 3. Add garlic, rosemary and the wine and let it come to a boil. Add olives and tomatoes. 4. Reduce heat to medium low and partly cover the pot. Simmer until chicken is tender and the broth is reduced to a rich sauce, about 40 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Related post/s: The Naked Chef Takes Off by Jamie Oliver

I'm not a baker so I was very careful with this recipe I adapted from foodtv.com. It was very involved but I had fun rolling the dough like clay. Ingredients: 2 cups of oatmeal 2 cups of flour 1 cup of raisins 2 sticks of unsalted butter, melted for a few seconds in the microwave 3/4 cup white sugar 3/4 cup brown sugar 2 eggs 1 tsp ground cinnamon 1 tsp baking soda 1 tsp hot water 2 tsps vanilla extract 1 tsp salt 1. Preheat oven to 350º. In the meantime, brush a cookie sheet with some of the melted butter. Set aside. 2. Use the remaining butter and combine with the sugars in a mixing bowl and cream with an electric mixer. Add the eggs. Mix in oatmeal, flour, cinnamon, baking soda and salt with a big spoon. Add water, raisins and vanilla extract. Mix well to finish your dough. 3. Transfer the dough to a floured kitchen counter or table. Form a snake with your dough using your hands. Cut in several small pieces and place on prepared cookie sheet. 4. Bake for 10 to 15 minutes or until light brown. Let them cool before serving.

170 Mercer Street off Houston 212/334.5253 about $125 for two, with two drinks, without tip ♥ ♥ ♥ Updated, 2007: Honmura An is now closed. When it's cold outside, all I want is a hot bowl of soba. When I have money, Honmura An is always my first pick. It's one of the few places in New York City that still makes its own soba. If you come at the right time during the week, you can watch one of the Japanese guys cut the buckwheat into single noodles in the back of the restaurant. It's pretty cool to watch the precision involved in soba-making. If you go on a Saturday, several limos pull up outside dropping off well-dressed Japanese people for brunch. Even when it's packed inside, the cherry blossoms and the clean lines of its furniture design provide a haven from busy Houston Street. The dinner menu is a little more pricey and a $50 tasting menu requires at least two people to order per table. I usually order the nameko mushroom hot soba with an avocado or salmon salad to start. Whatever I'm in the mood for, I end my meal with their homemade green tea ice cream.

This is another salad I make when there are avocados for sale in my neighborhood supermarket. To make sure I buy ripe avocados, I look at the nubbin where the stem came from. If the avocado is ripe, the nubbin pushes right out with my thumb. The best way is to buy the avocados when they're still a bit green and firm and ripen them at home for about a week. Ingredients: 1 bunch of spinach, washed thoroughly 2 ripe avocados, meat scooped out and sliced into small chunks lemon juice salt, pepper, olive oil 1. To make the dressing, whisk some olive oil in a salad bowl with lemon juice. Season with salt and pepper. 2. Add spinach to the dressing and toss with avocado chunks.

It's a lot smaller and less noisy, plus the waiters have time to talk to you about their suggestions like the kamote tops, a vegetable more familiar to the Filipinos than the Chinese, or the deep-fried whole quail. Some of my other favorites are the fish with yellow chives and the string beans with minced pork. Seasonal vegetables include peashoot leaves, swamp cabbage (or kang-kong) and baby bok choy flash-fried in garlic. Start with the mandatory xiao long bao, or soupy buns, and taste what made Joe's Shanghai open up Joe's Ginger in the first place.

For a short time in the fall, squash runners show up in Chinatown. The Filipino way would be to boil them until tender. Then we dip them in white vinegar mixed with bagoong, or shrimp paste, using our hands and eat them with white rice. Squash runners are nutrituously bitter so the sour and salty dip is a good match. I wanted to try something different without using any dip so that I can serve the vegetables to non-Filipinos, so I used some Italian prosciutto as a salty alternative. I served them with sweet pickle juice on the side. Ingredients: 1 bunch of squash runners, also called squash vines, the thicker part of the stalks removed, thoroughly washed and patted dry with a paper towel 2 cloves of garlic, minced 1 small red onion, roughly chopped prosciutto, thinly-sliced 1. In a skillet with hot oil, sauté garlic until golden brown. Add red onions until transparent. Toss in squash runner and cook until tender and wilted. 2. Remove squash runners to a plate lined with paper towel. 3. Using a separate plate, prepare each slice of prosciutto, fill in with a cooked squash runner and roll to wrap.

I bought a jar of Calypso tuna in olive oil during one of my visits to Di Palo in Little Italy. It is more expensive that the tuna-in-a-can that you see in the regular supermarket so I was curious to taste the difference. First of all, the olive oil that Calypso uses tastes good on its own that I used it as the dressing for this salad. It didn't taste like it's been in a sealed container for who knows how long. The tuna was in three big chunks and they flaked as soon as I fluffed the meat using a fork. I ended up using the one jar for three servings of this tuna salad. Ingredients: 1 jar of Calypso tuna in olive oil half a pound of mixed greens like arugula and mesclun salt and pepper 1. After washing greens thoroughly, toss with tuna and its olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper to taste. Related post/s: Where to buy Calypso tuna

I adapted this recipe from an issue of Saveur Magazine. The flank is the underside of a cow's belly. It's a bit more chewy than the sirloin right above it, but it has a great beefy flavor for a cheap cut of beef. Marinating it for a couple of hours or even overnight makes it easier to cook later. Keep it medium-rare because flank gets more tough if overdone. Serve with bottles of Corona beer. Ingredients: 1/2 pound of beef steak flour tortillas 2 large tomatoes, chopped 1 red bell pepper, julienned 2 large red onions, thinly sliced 3 cloves of garlic, crushed light soy sauce lime juice half a bunch of cilantro, finely chopped red chili flakes chipotle sauce salt, pepper 1. Make the marinade. Mix in soy sauce, garlic, one of the onions and half of the cilantro in a bowl. Add some lime juice and season with salt and pepper to taste. Add the steak and marinate, covered in the fridge, for a couple of hours. 2. When ready to prepare, make salsa. Combine tomatoes, the other onion and the rest of the cilantro in a bowl. Add some lime juice and season with salt, pepper and red chilis to taste. 3. A few minutes before serving, preheat oven to 400º. Transfer steak to a pan and broil for about 7 minutes on each side for medium-rare. Remove from the oven and let rest for 10 minutes on a chopping board. Slice into strips along the grain. 4. Wrap tortillas in aluminum foil and heat in the oven for less than 2 minutes. 5. Let your guests assemble their own fajita: fill in tortilla with strips of steak and red bell pepper with some salsa, lime juice and chipotle sauce.

I was walking in the Washington Heights area one Saturday afternoon when I saw cactus pads, or nopales in Spanish, on display in one of the grocery stores. I immediately remembered our trip to Mexico where we had numerous unforgettable meals. In the town of Pochutla in Oaxaca, we ate several times at Lichita Restaurant and I remember how I eagerly ordered cactus soup because the idea of eating the cactus pads excited me. I was just so curious as to how it would taste. It has the texture of broccoli stalks, tender but succulent inside. I gather that the softness is because of how the plant itself collects so much water in order to survive in the dessert. Don't fear the thorns. They're usually dry enough to pare off using a small knife. You can make your usual tomato soup but it would be less boring to have cactus chunks in it. Ingredients: 4 cactus pads 2 medium-sized tomatoes, chopped 1 small can of tomato sauce 3 cups of chicken stock 2 cloves of garlic, minced 1 medium red onion lime juice a handful of cilantro, finely chopped salt, pepper, oil 1. Slice off thorns from cactus pads. Cut in small chunks. 2. Heat a little oil in a hot sauce pan. Sauté garlic until light brown, onions until transparent and tomatoes until mushy. Add tomato sauce and bring to a boil over medium heat. Then add chicken stock and bring to a second boil. 3. Add cactus and let simmer for about 15 minutes until tender. Add lime and cilantro and season with salt and pepper to taste. Related post/s: Good ol' chicken stock Where to buy nopales, or cactus pads

I adapted this from a Nigella Lawson recipe from The New York Times. In New York City, you can get green tea noodles from Sunrise Mart for less than $5 for two bunches. You can use soba noodles as a substitute, you just won't have that interesting green color. If you don't have an Asian grocery store where you live, try using angel-hair pasta. The secret is balancing the sweet and sour tastes of the vinegar and the sugar. Ingredients: 1 bunch of green tea noodles 1 cucumber, peeled and julienned red chilis, seeded and finely chopped 3 tbsps sugar 6 tbsps rice wine vinegar 2 tbsps sesame oil half a bunch of cilantro, finely chopped 1. Cook noodles in boiling water for about 5 minutes. When done, drain and fluff with a fork to keep the noodles from sticking together. 2. In a small saucepan over low heat, dissolve sugar, rice wine vinegar and 2 tbsps of water. 3. In a salad bowl, pour dressing over cucumber and chilis. Add noodles and toss. Drizzle with sesame oil and sprinkle with cilantro. Refrigerate for a few minutes until salad is chilled. Related post/s: Where to buy green tea noodles

Sicilian granita is a semi-frozen dessert of sugar and water. You can substitute the celery from this recipe with almost anything that's in season. I first tasted a homemade version of granita in Vermont when one of the boy's professor served us a small snack flavored with raspberries he grew in his yard. He mentioned that a vegetable as flavoring will even work, so when I returned to New York City, I made it with celery. If you have access to Chinese celery-they are thinner and softer than the American kind-use it because it has a spicier taste to it. This recipe makes a generous bowl of granita. Ingredients: 1 bunch of celery, rinsed and patted dry 1/2 cup of sugar 1/2 cup of water 1 tray of ice cubes lemon juice mint leaves, finely chopped 1. Make the simple syrup. In a sauce pan, bring water with sugar to a boil. Simmer until clear, about 3 minutes. Pour into a bowl and set aside to cool. 2. Using a food processor, puree celery stalks. With a cheese cloth, strain the celery juice to another bowl to make sure you don't have any of the pulp. In a blender, chop ice cubes until crushed. 3. To serve, pour over some celery juice and simple syrup in a bowl of crushed ice. Sprinkle some lemon juice to balance out the sweet and sour tastes. You can serve this immediately with mint leaves on top.

Your beet will be smoother if you use a more powerful blender. I have to get married first in order to get one of those, so for now, mine will have the consistency of a chunkier version. Ingredients: 1 bunch of red beets, rinsed well 1 yellow onion, chopped coarsely 2 garlic cloves, minced 3 cups of chicken stock lemon juice salt, pepper, olive oil 1. Cook the beets in a big pot of boiling water, uncovered, until tender, about 45 minutes to an hour. When done, run them under cold water to cool. Dry with paper towel and peel and then cut into large chunks. Set aside. 2. In a large skillet, saute garlic and onions with a little salt. Set aside. 3. Using a blender, puree beets, onions and garlic until smooth. Add stock slowly until you reach the desired consistency. Season to taste with salt, pepper and some lemon juice. 4. Chill the soup before serving, then ladle into bowls and garnish with mint leaves. Related post/s: Good ol' chicken stock

I picked up Modern Greek: 170 Contemporary Recipes from the Mediterranean and read about skordalia, or garlic sauce. The recipe suggested fried vegetables, like eggplant and zucchini, to serve and dip in it. I used bread as a thickener for the sauce but you can always use potatoes or even walnuts for a nuttier taste. If you have access to panko, or Japanese breadcrumbs, use it because it's much lighter than flour. Ingredients for the vegetables: 1 eggplant, sliced in thin rounds 1 zucchini, sliced in thin rounds 1 cup of flour 3/4 cup warm water 1 egg, lightly beaten salt, pepper, olive oil 1. In a large bowl, mix flour with water until smooth. Beat in the egg and combine with olive oil, salt and pepper. Set aside. 2. Heat some olive oil in a large skillet. Dip the vegetables in the batter and cook in the hot oil until golden brown, about 3 minutes per side. 3. Drain on paper towels and serve with skordalia as dipping sauce. Ingredients for the skordalia: 3 slices of wheat bread, without crust 6 garlic cloves, peeled 2 tbsps of red wine vinegar salt, pepper, olive oil 1. Soak the bread in water for about 15 minutes. Squeeze out the excess moisture. 2. Crush garlic and salt using a mortar and pestle until garlic is puréed. Combine with the bread, vinegar and pepper in a food processor. Blend until smooth, slowly adding olive oil in the process. Related post/s: Modern Greek: 170 Contemporary Recipes from the Mediterranean at Amazon.com

My parents buy their groceries in bulk. I found a box of Perdue smoked chicken breasts in the fridge and they turned out to be the perfect salad ingredient. This recipe is also good with leftover roasted chicken. I had a zucchini in the fridge which I thinly sliced and then I tossed a small bunch of spinach in the bowl at the last-minute. The result? A salad you can eat without any proding from your nutritionist. Ingredients: Perdue smoked chicken breasts, cut in smaller pieces 1 zucchini, thinly sliced a bunch of spinach, thoroughly washed and roughly chopped 1 red onion, thinly sliced lemon juice salt, pepper, olive oil 1. Whisk lemon juice with olive oil in a bowl. Add salt and pepper to taste. Toss in the rest of the ingredients and let sit for a few minutes to let them marinate in the dressing.

My friend Stacie, who is Greek, taught me how to appreciate feta cheese. Feta is traditionally made from goat or sheep's milk. It's salted and brined and dries easily when drained. It's the crumbly texture that makes it a perfect dressing for a tossed salad. I combined some feta cheese I bought with some beefsteak tomatoes. Drizzle some very good olive oil and you'll have the perfect summer salad. Ingredients: beefsteak tomatoes, diced fresh feta cheese, crumbled baby Yukon potatoes 1 small red onion, thinly sliced a squirt of lemon juice a jig of red wine vinegar salt, pepper, olive oil 1. Cook the potatoes in salted boiling water until tender. Drain and quarter them to smaller pieces. 2. Combine and toss all the ingredients in a big bowl and season to taste.

This is one of my favorite dishes to make in the summer when all kinds of tomatoes are in season. For this recipe, I use beefsteak tomatoes, a round and bigger type, because they're not as juicy as the heirloom ones. I toss them with pasta shells to mimic the shape of the sliced tomatoes and then I add some boiled baby Yukon potatoes to make it heftier. It's a great dish to pack in a Tupperware for the beach-all the carbohydrates will keep you alert even if you're under the sun all day. Ingredients: pasta shells beefsteak tomatoes, diced baby Yukon potatoes fresh mozzarella cheese, diced 1 small red onion, thinly sliced 1 small bunch of flat-leaf parsley, roughly chopped salt, pepper, olive oil 1. Cook the pasta in boiling water for about 15 minutes. Drain and shock in an ice bath to stop its cooking. 2. Cook the potatoes in salted boiling water until tender. Drain and quarter them to smaller pieces. 3. Combine and toss all the ingredients in a big bowl and season to taste.

210 East 46th Street between Second and Third 212/687.4855 $200 for two, with a bottle of wine, without tip ♥ ♥ ♥ My older brother lives in Manila and whenever he visits New York City, he has one request: eat a nice slab of steak at Sparks Steak House. When mafia boss Paul Castellano and mobster Thomas Bilotti were gunned down in front of the restaurant in 1985 under the orders of John Gotti, it forever put it on the map as one of New York City's institutions. It's less violent today because the crowd is mostly made up of the younger finance bunch who want to splurge before signing a business deal, but commoners like me can still enjoy a juicy sirloin steak with a bold glass of red wine. Avoid peak dinner times and reserve a table for 9pm or later, especially on weekends, because you'll spend less money at the bar while you wait. (We once waited an hour drinking at the bar even with an 8pm table.) You might not be related to any one in the Gambino family, but you'll feel like royalty after you treat yourself to one of the Ceetta Brothers' cuts of meat.

I watched the boy make his own kalbi marinade for a barbeque party once. It's so involved, that's why people usually just buy it in a jar. Kalbi, or galbi, as some Koreans spell it, is really just short beef ribs cut across the bone. You can even leave them uncut but they're easier to marinate and broil later if the bones are smaller. Filipino barbeque is as sweet as this Korean-style version, so I immediately knew my parents would like it. I went to the meat market and asked the butcher to cut the ribs lengthwise. I now make this marinade ahead of time and store it in a jar in the fridge. For more flavor, marinate the ribs for a day. Ingredients: 2 pounds beef short ribs, cut lengthwise 1 cup soy sauce 2 tbsps white sugar a jig of rice wine 3 tbsp sesame oil 1 knob ginger, minced 1 bulb of small garlic, minced 1 bunch of scallions, finely chopped salt, pepper 1. Make kalbi marinade. In a small pot over low heat, slowly dissolve sugar in soy sauce. Slowly add small amounts of water to dilute the saltiness of the soy sauce. Remove from heat and set aside to cool. 2. Massage meat with sesame oil and the rest of the ingredients in a glass baking pan. Add the marinade over the meat and let sit, covered with plastic wrap, for a couple of hours. 3. When ready to cook, broil in the oven for about 10 minutes.

28 1/2 Bowery corner of Bayard 212/349.0923 about $10 for two, without drinks, with tip ♥ ♥ ♥ Noodletown is not only a restaurant, it's an institution. When Chinatown becomes a ghost town, Noodletown, or Great N.Y. Noodletown, as their sign suggests, is still open and stays open until four in the morning. Asian kids who come from a long night of dancing and drinking usually end up in Noodletown. Customers sit with strangers in round tables with only one thing in mind: the congee to cure the hangover that's to come in the morning. I've made many inebriated visits to Noodletown as well. I usually order the congee with slivers of roasted duck and dot it with spicy hot oil. Visit during the day for a saner experience and order the roast duck or roast pork hanging by the window. For less than $5, it's a great deal for lunch. The soft-shell crabs, lightly battered and flash-fried, are delicious when they are in season. If you can manage to get one of the abrupt waiters to tell you what vegetable is fresh, order the peashoot leaves or the swamp cabbage sauteed in garlic or stir-fried in oyster sauce.

The Philippines is a tropical country but during the monsoon season, Filipinos stay in and make soup. Lugaw is heavier than plain soup because of the sticky rice that we use. I grew up eating it with leftover chicken meat to drive the flu away. Americans will compare it to rice porridge and the Chinese refer to it as congee; the Japanese okayu. No matter what you call it though, and whether you like it soupy or thick, this dish will make you feel better. This version is the easy way using leftover white rice and store-bought chicken stock. To add some flavor, my friend Anna introduced me to Chinese pickled cabbage and stinky tofu. I spoon a teaspoon to each serving and skip the salt and pepper. Ingredients: 2 cups of white rice, cooked 4 cups of chicken stock 1 preserved duck egg, sliced 2 stalks of scallions, roughly chopped a handful of cilantro, finely chopped 2 cloves of garlic, minced, toasted a drizzle of fish sauce juice from 1 lime 1. In a saucepan, combine stock and rice and let simmer until hot. Toss in the scallions and the cilantro and mix. Season with fish sauce and lime juice. 2. Ladle in bowls and sprinkle with toasted garlic and top with sliced duck eggs before serving Related post/s: Buy preserved duck eggs, pickled cabbage and stinky tofu from Asia Food Market

This was the first dish I've ever cooked for the boy that impressed him. He's a much better cook than I am and it thrilled me to watch him clean up his bowl and ask for a second serving. I was visiting him in Vermont and we stopped by his professor's house to borrow a canoe. We harvested some ramps from the side of the lake and he gave us rhubarb from his yard. The boy cooked a nice duck dinner with the ramps while I baked the rhubarb for dessert. Top this with either vanilla or strawberry ice cream and your boyfriend will be impressed too. Ingredients: 1 pound rhubarb, cut into pieces 3/4 inch thick white sugar flour half a stick of unsalted butter 1/2 cup of plain oatmeal 1 tsp of ground cinnamon vanilla or strawberry ice cream 1. Preheat oven to 400º. 2. Place the rhubarb in a square glass baking dish and toss with 1/2 cup sugar and 1/8 cup flour. 3. In a food processor, pulse 1/4 flour with butter until clumps are pea-size. Add 1/4 cup of sugar, 1/2 cup of oatmeal and cinnamon. Pulse to combine. Sprinkle over rhubarb. 4. Bake until golden brown, about 35 minutes.

Basil was abundant in Vermont so the boy made pesto for our pasta meal. It's amazing how easy it is to make dinner with just the right, fresh ingredient. Back in New York City, I replicated the dish. Can you guess which one is mine? Ingredients: half a box of penne 1/2 pound of fresh basil leaves, rinsed well and roughly chopped 4 cloves of garlic, finely chopped a handful of pine nuts 2 tsps lemon juice salt, pepper, olive oil 1. Make the pesto. In a food processor, pulse basil, pine nuts and garlic to combine. Slowly drizzle a little bit of olive oil while pulsing. Add lemon juice, salt and pepper to taste. 2. Boil a pot of water and add penne with a little salt and olive oil for about 15 minutes. Shock cooked pasta with cold water and drain. 3. In a large bowl, combine a small amount of pesto with the penne. Sprinkle with salt and pepper if necessary or add another jig of olive oil for more moisture.

I first heard of ramps while eating at The Tasting Room. I found out later that they are only available in the spring. Ramps belong in the leek family and they taste like onion and garlic combined. A co-worker told me she used to eat them raw as a child growing up in Virginia. We were in Vermont one spring for a canoe trip and the boy's professor directed us to the side of the lake where they grew like weeds. We harvested them and made a really nice duck dinner with them as a side. When I stopped by the New York City farmers' market, they had them for sale and sure enough, people were standing in line to buy them even at $2.50 a bunch. Ingredients: 2 bunches of ramps a thin sliver of pancetta, diced a bowl of ice water salt, pepper 1. Add thoroughly washed ramps in boiling water for four minutes. When they're done, drain and shock them in ice water to stop its cooking. 2. Fry the pancetta in a skillet and drain on a paper towel. 3. Using the same skillet, add the ramps and toss them in the rendered fat with salt and pepper.

One of my co-workers is an avid vegetable gardener. We were talking about his yard in the suburbs and he mentioned that he was waiting to harvest his chilis. A few months later, he gave me a bag of his produce, dried and ready to be cooked. It was a beautiful bounty and I was grateful for the gift. Only a Chinese dish would inspire this much chili, specifically from the Sichuan province, which could be hot, sour, salty and tongue-numbing at the same time. I used the small, round pellets shown in the photo below. Ingredients: 1 pound medium shrimp, peeled, deveined and butterflied 2 tbsps shao hsing sauce 1 tsp light soy sauce 1/2 tsp sesame oil 1/2 tsp peanut oil 1/2 tsp hot chili oil 1/2 tsp white sugar 1/2 tsp MSG 1 red bell pepper, julienned 1 green bell peppers, julienned 1 medium carrot, peeled and julienned 1 small turnip, peeled and julienned a handful of snow peas, destringed and torn in half 2 stalks of scallions, cut lengthwise red chiles 3 cloves of garlic, minced a knob of ginger, minced salt 1. Sprinkle shrimp with some salt and let stand for 30 minutes. Then wash the shrimps with cold water, drain and add sprinkle a little bit more salt. Let stand for another five minutes. Wash the shrimps with cold water again and drain well but do not dry. 2. Prepare and mix together all the spices and oils in a glass bowl to make a sauce. Set aside. 3. In a hot wok, heat two cups of peanut oil. Immerse shrimps into the hot oil and cook until white, about 60 seconds. Remove using a slotted spoon. Drain all but 2 tbsps of the oil and stir fry the ginger, garlic, scallions and chilis. Add the red and green peppers, carrots, snow peas and turnips and cook until soft. Add the shrimps and the sauce and toss.

I had no clue why the Chinatown fish store I went to called the fish buttercups but I needed some type of flat fish to replicate the dish we ate while in Amsterdam. It was Michel's birthday and he had invited his family to visit from the suburbs. We joined them and a few of his friends at their flat for a small celebration and this dish stood out. Peashoot leaves are ridiculously expensive even in Chinatown but they are one of my favorite vegetables. I added them to the buttercups for both color and a slight bitter taste. Ingredients: any type of small and flat white fish like buttercups a bunch of peashoot leaves red onion, sliced into rings a handful of flat-leaf parsley, finely chopped slices of lemon salt, pepper, olive oil 1. Preheat oven to 375º. Cover the bottom of a glass baking dish with the slices of lemon, parsley and onion rings. Place the fish on top without overlapping. Sprinkle with salt and pepper and drizzle generously with olive oil. Top again with some more onion rings and lemon slices. 2. Cook in the oven for 10 to 15 minutes until peashoot leaves are wilted and fish is white and meaty inside.

72 East 1st Street on First Avenue 212/358.7831 about $150 for two, with two drinks, without tip ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ When people ask me for my top five restaurants in New York City, I rank Sushiden on five, Tom Colicchio's Gramercy Tavern on four, Snack on three and Mario Batali's Babbo in second place. I usually get a reaction when I tell them that The Tasting Room ranks first because they have never heard of it or because the proprietors are more famous at the farmers' market than they are on FoodTV. The Tasting Room is where I was introduced to ramps a couple of years ago. Ramps belong in the leek family and have the taste and smell of garlic and onions combined. Ours were served with very tender Moulard duck breast. I have been ramp farming every spring in Vermont since then. I don't know any other restaurant in New York City where I can eat carpaccio, squab and to-die-for pork belly all in one seating. I visited for a second time a couple of weeks ago to see the difference in their autumn menu. Again, my expectations were superseded. A friend and I started with the uni velouté and then the fluke tartare with roasted eggplant. The soup was perfect for the almost-winter weather outside; it could have been butternut squash because of the color but the distinct taste of the ocean was obviously there. We also ordered the rabbit terrine and the pheasant in three ways: rillettes, roasted breast meat and chopped liver. My dining partner definitely knew she wanted fish to match with her choice of white wine, so she picked the striped bass with smoked eel, pappas amarillos and roasted garlic. Maitake mushrooms are still in season so I chose them with scallops, turnips and celery root purée-simply delicious. The turnips and the celery made the maitake subtle, which sometimes could be overwhelming in taste and in smell, but the saltiness of the scallops brought all of them together. We opted for the cheesecake with red wine-braised pear to finish, which carried the namesake of the co-owner's mother. The space is tiny with about ten tables but the dishes speak volumes. You have a choice of tasting portions for all of their dishes or a share at double the amount. The service is attentive whether it's to answer your questions (What the hell is salsify? What is burdock?) or to recommend one of their numerous bottles of domestic wine. Updated, 2007: The Tasting Room is now a café and the restaurant has moved to a bigger space on Elizabeth Street off Houston.

216 East 10th Street between First and Second 212/477.2972 about $75 for two prix fixes, with two drinks, without tip ♥ ♥ ♥ Shabu in Japanese means \"to swish,\" and when you're at shabu-shabu, swishing your chopsticks to mix in fresh minced ginger and scallions together with the cabbage, watercress, mushrooms and thinly-sliced ribeye beef in a steaming pot of broth is exactly what you do. Pick up a few slices of raw beef using your chopsticks, swish in the broth for a few seconds, pick them up and dip in a sesame-based sauce and eat them with sticky white rice. Before your meal ends, small cups are provided so you can ladle the broth, which now tastes like beef extract, and slurp it like soup with thin or flat noodles and seasoned with salt and pepper. A prix fixe of shabu-shabu for two with salad and ginger dressing, rice and ice cream is about $20 per person. It's even better if you're with a big group because the whole concept of swishing and sharing becomes more fun. I crave eating at Shabu Tatsu in the summer even if it's too hot to slurp hot broth, but I especially pine for it during the cold winter months when the only comfort I can turn to is a comforting bowl of soup.

105 Thompson between Prince and Spring Streets 212/925.1040 about $60 for two for dinner or $15 for one during lunch, with drinks, with tip ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ At least once a month, I get a craving for Snack's artichoke chicken salad. A big bowl of potatoes, butter beans, tomatoes, string beans and chicken are tossed with black olive vinaigrette. If I'm in the mood for braised lamb without the heavy sauce, I order their braised lamb sandwich with tomatoes and roasted red onions with tomato aioli and arugula on ciabata bread. The bulgur wheat salad is also delicious with mint and walnuts in citrus vinaigrette. I've had better houmus and pita bread elsewhere but I doubt any other Greek restaurant, Queens included, can beat their spanakopitakia or spinach triangles. The phyllo flakes off ever-so-lightly at each bite. For dinner hours, the menu changes to include heftier items. When I visit, I always order the white anchovies and the octopus as appetizers. For main courses, I've enjoyed their vegetarian mousaka with eggplants, mushrooms and potatoes in creamy bechamel sauce. The braised lamb stifado smells really nice with currants and apricots while the keftedakia or veal meatballs are a treat with pine nuts. Snack's menu rarely changes, but with meals that are sure to please, I don't see a reason why it should.

What's the difference between chicken stock and chicken broth? Even though the terms are used interchangeably, chicken broth has more gelée properties when reduced to make sauce, so you want to use fleshier chicken parts to make broth. That gelatinous quality will bind up pan drippings better for a beefier reduction. Chicken carcass will suffice to make chicken stock for almost any kind of soup. Breast and neck bones are great but you can also buy whole chicken carcasses in Chinatown for a dollar. I always add celery stalks, leeks and carrots when I make either. Browning them first with garlic and onions will give your stock or broth a more roasted taste in the end. I use quart containers I've saved from my parents' Chinese takeouts to store the stock in the fridge for up to three weeks. Ingredients: 2 chicken carcasses 3 garlic cloves, crushed 1 large onion, quartered 2 celery stalks, cut into thirds 1 carrot, cut into thirds 1 large leek, cut into thirds salt, pepper and oil 1. In a large stock pot, sauté garlic and onions in hot oil. Lightly brown all the vegetables before adding the chicken bones. Let the chicken bones heat up in the pot while stirring ocassionally to avoid sticking. 2. Add enough water to cover the chicken bones. Bring to a boil over high heat and let the impurities rise to the top. Scoop and discard the impurities using a strainer. Reduce heat and let the stock simmer for 2 to 3 hours until water is reduced. 3. Remove from heat and let stock cool for a few minutes. Store in quart containers and put in the fridge.

28 Mott Street south of Pell 212/227.1810 about $80 for two, with two drinks, without tip ♥ Peking Duck House is unlike any other restaurant in Chinatown because they actually put extra effort in their interior design. It attracts diners who are still skeptical of the hole-in-the-walls in the neighborhood. You will be served on tables covered with cloth unless you're seated downstairs where the fluorescent and lazy susans rule the room. Uncannily enough, most of the diners upstairs are white. The staff aims to please, especially if your group is not entirely Asian. It was a little unsettling when I experienced two kinds of treatments when I visited with different people separately. There are plenty of restaurants that serve Peking duck in Chinatown, but it is the Peking Duck House's specialty. For other Chinese dishes, you're better off paying less down the street.

60 East 65th Street between Madison and Park 212/288.0033 discounted for about $200 for two, with matching wine, without tip ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ Daniel is one of Daniel Boulud's New York City restaurants and has been rated by Michelin and The New York Times with four stars more than once. It's that kind of restaurant with those kind of people-my boyfriend and I needed a big event to have an excuse to eat there. The best we could do was to celebrate finishing his first year of medical school. A few weeks before our date, I met chef Alex Lee to interview him for an online magazine, generationrice. We talked about his becoming-a-chef story and his history with Daniel Boulud. We were also given a tour of the Daniel kitchens. It now counts as one of my most amazing experiences in New York City. He let us in before dinner time and we saw the production kitchen, the coffee kitchen, the French and the American kitchens, plus the dessert room where we tasted chocolates on layers and layers of trays made in-house. All that only added to our actual dining experience. We returned a few weeks later for dinner and chef Alex Lee did not forget us. Our waiter kept serving us complementary dishes from downstairs even though we'd already ordered our appetizers and main dishes. Wine was brought out to match each course, and in between meals, there were cheeses, soups and chocolates. We were just delirious with the whole experience. When the bill was put on our table three hours later, we could have detached our arms and legs or promised to sell my future children to pay for it, but it also noted that 70 per cent of it was already covered. You see? It's all about who you know!
