We all know that Momofuku Ssam Bar is now bringing the cocktail fury, and it seems that the original Noodle Bar could be next to get the full cocktail treatment. According to CB 3's pending June Calendar, David Chang's Momo Noodle Bar will be appearing before the board to request an upgrade to a full liquor license, meaning that mixology master Don Lee's cocktail program will be jumping over one block to the flagship on First Avenue. And ice will included. Everybody start to freak out now! We would bother to confirm with Chang and Co. ourselves, but everyone else will just wind up stealing it and making it their own story, so why bother. Just remember you read it hear first.

Hello sunshine and hello June. It's time to start the week with a Monday Morning Quick Hits! QUICK MOFO HITS! Boooom. 1. The oh so adorable The Smile is poised to expand its current breakfast and lunch offerings to dinner service, and the early word is delicious, with @WilliamTigertt reporting \"The Thai beef salad and blueberry panna cotta were winners.\" Oh my! 2. Prince Harry was on his best behavior during his recent NYC adventure, but did he manage to sneak in a bit of time to enjoy some of Manhattan's late night offerings? According to one Little Birdy, the answer is yes, telling DBTH that \"Prince Harry and entourage were at the Box on Friday night.\" That makes perfect sense! We can so picture the Prince convincing his advance team that the Box was legitimate dinner theater!

Harbor Club Packs Its Bags For Georgica

It's one and done for the Harbor Club in Bridgehampton, which just opened last weekend and promised to \"bring the sexy back\" the Hamptons. What they also did is open their new club without any kind of outdoor permit or cabaret license. Our Little Birdy says, \"Harbor club in Bridgehampton finished after 1st weekend of summer. Door and bar was chaos, Fire Marshall closed doors in middle of the first Friday of memorial day weekend. Fines for no outdoor permit, not being allowed to have a DJ and dancing, noise complaints etc soon followed, and after being told no DJs were allowed, the people behind it all jumped ship.\" A quick check of their license shows they only have a standard OP permit, which certainly won't fly with the Suffolk county folks for an outdoor nightclub. We checked in with a club rep, who confirmed that their days at the former Ziggy's are indeed dunzo, telling DBTH that after the visit from the Fire Marshall, \"we assessed capacity issues and came to the following decision. After last weekends opening, we have decided, starting this Friday, May 29th, The Harbor Club will be open at its new home in the newly remodeled Georgica Space ( the old saracen)\". One week of existence has to be some kind of record for shortest amount of time for a club to be open in the Hamptons or anywhere else on earth. Hamptons 2009 - catch the fever!

i guess people are finally discovering that paying $500 to sit around table with your douchebag friends from the city and do a ton of coke, surrounded by other tables with douchebags from the city doing a ton of coke, in a place filled with douchbags from the city doing a ton of coke, where there are douchebags who do a ton of coke waiting in line to get in, isn't that cool anymore. Plus the grease trail from the middle of long island out to hampton bays has dried up since the economy hit the fan, i dont know how these guys expected the cool, classy, nurturing girls and deep, down to earth, stand-up guys that hang out in these kinds of places to get all the way out to the turnpike. When the local cops and firemen start busting local dead-beat dads and coked-out douchebag 20-somethings, you know the super rich have started to mess up. Sorry fellas, easy money is gone.
knowitall
2009-06-02 11:08:00
this place had potential, good looking design, outdoor space, street parking on the turnpike....problem is it apparently wasn't zoned for a nightclub. You think the owner or the supposed hot shots from the city would have figured out that there was a problem with the place long before the red ropes went up. the easy $$ is gone but thee will always be demand for a place to go out here up and down the spectrum of nite crawlers. Just like the city there are a, b c & d listers and everyone thinks they belong to the grade above them. Bridgehampton/ Sag def has a void of places to go. No 21 water, sen's lounge now a thai restaurant, wild rose long history, Star Room a bust. Prediciton the new guys at Saracen are going to get into a boatload of trouble if they try running that place as a club (see their lineup of Deejays for the summer) and not a restaurant.

We love juicy, unsubstantiated complaints from nightclub employees. Today, a Little Birdy from Mr. West sings us a song about a litany of problems at the relatively new and hardly discussed nightspot, saying: i work at mr.west, a lot of staff is disgruntled, no one is making money, and there are people talking about mr.west closing down (just thought i should let you know), because management - danny devine is never there, jus ske is spinning all over the city except at Mr.West, its a mess. It is empty every night (wednesdays are decent crowd, but no money), and not to mention, they have been calling staff last minute and cutting shifts, its not fair. last, but not least, they put cheap vodka in their grey goose bottles for promoters. i wasn't going to say something, but its unfair how they are treating me, and the rest of the staff, if the doors are closing, tell us. ahh, sorry, just venting. No need to apologize - that's what we are here for! Got a complaint? Let us know!

Fuck that place. The parties were fun, but the door staff were (typically) full of them selves and the drinks extremely overpriced for what it was. A few months ago I was there two Wednesdays in a row. Then the next time they were giving me shit getting in because I said I was on one of the DJ's list, which I was, but forgot what his list pseudonym was since I just knew him by his real name. They knew who I was talking about but were being useless. So me and the two girls I was with decided not to bother with that place any more, who wants to travel that far to get hassled on a Wednesday.It's their own fault for being douches with locals.

Meanwhile we're the girls who frequent tenjune, 1oak, goldbar.. Hm.And it doesn't take a genius to figure that they illegally marry promoters' grey-well-bottom-shelf-goose bottles.

Mr. West is a great place. Danny Divine is the most genuine, most hard working, and most honest guy in the nightlife business. Those of you hating on him OBVIOUSLY dont know him and OBVIOUSLY have not been working in this industry for very long. Don't you have anything better to do with your time? Danny Divine, Evan Frost and Jus Ske are veterans in the nightlife business; three guys with great personality and good hearts. A rare find in the nightlife game. Whoever wrote this...GET A LIFE! And GROW THE FUCK UP! You must be very young and evidently very stupid. Oh, And one more thing...if you want to waste your time hating on Danny...at least learn how to spell his name correctly...

2009-05-29 00:32:00
Maybe I'm biased as a nightlife employee, but I think staff's opinions of a venue are incredibly valid, maybe more valid than your average patron. Who sees what the crowd is every night? Staff. Who knows everyone and can get in anywhere? Staff. Who knows if a venue is failing to profit because they are not receiving the checks with their credit card tips or those checks are bouncing? Staff. And I don't mean promoters. An interesting post would be \"Which clubs around town are bouncing checks?\"

\"Go for it\" my \"for real\". The place is a small club but don't hate on them and believe me, Danny has totally been shitty to me, but I have to defend him, because he isn't mean, he is just not an operator. He and his wife are nice but he has a very mean and terrible side to him, perhaps that is why his venue sucks. But Evan doesn't wrk there anymore....
not so good
2009-05-29 10:40:00
yeah they have def been shady in the past with their money and I am speaking from experience and it just seems like from all the hearsay going around this place is doomed. It is a shame though to a certain degree. Yes, the name sucks, as does the location but they had a pretty good sound system and a fun dance floor, and recently with Aoki there and Ronson its been fun. I have been going the past couple wednesday and agree with the waitress/bartender only night worth going. The bar was empty but the dance floor packed. At least they had something right with the music 1 day of the week and I'd go as far to say best dance rave around for a few weeks there. Now lets enjoy watching this sinking ship! Mess Kid and Chainsmokers where r they heading?

Evan frost is an awsome person. He's the one that brought all the parties to that fucking place. He is not a piece of shit. he is a great manager and is very fair to his employees. obviously your just a hater \"who the f* is rachel\" guy. This is a fucked up business and everyone gets bashed for stupid shit that they dont know anything about. no one knows what goes on behind running a business and a club. Jus ke is also a great guy and its unfortunate that he is getting dragged into this mess. He also brought all the good parties. So all of you who dont know them and are just deciding to go along with this shit, go fuck yourselves and get a life. oh and usually its the sleezy ass promoters who are the real fucking problem. they are cheap scum bags that never tip and just want free shit. and im pretty sure they are the ones writing these comments. Bring in some higher end clientele and money spenders and maybe you would get better respect. douchebags

People who are weak are quick to blame. Promoters who don't produce don't get paid. People who earn their keep (and they are few & far between in the nightlife biz), are rewarded. Too many people (& the person who wrote this unsubstantiated garbage) want things easy. Cocktail waitresses or bar staff who have somewhere better to go should pick there lazy cunt-asses up and go! Nothing worse than a whore who shakes her ass for money others are generating on their behalf then complains when things slow down. Nothing weaker than those who complain and wait for others to generate money they can not otherwise generate for themselves on real terms. Honest, humble, decent people keep their mouth shut. They preserve their integrity and move on. Obviously the loser who wrote this does not have anywhere better to go. A smart worker weighs their options in the industry. Whoever wrote this is lazy, unappreciative & weak!!

Part of me senses cover up... All said & done looks like shameless, vendetta-driven SELF-PROMOTION& COVER UP for WEAK PERFORMANCE to me.! SOUNDS LIKE THESE PROMO'S: DOUG, TIM SHARP, CHAINSMOKERS & DJ MESSKID etc,. weren't earning their keep. Mr.West is a good room (I've been there) and booked DJ's (I have an inside source) the Promo's could have NEVER got on their own i.e. STEVE AOKI, SAM RONSON, DAVE1 from CHROMEO, BERRIE, RUCKUS, JUS SKE etc. Sounds like these little wanks filled the room with free loading little wanna be hipsters who couldn't spend a $

your all a joke is right. Danny and Evan were together at Oak last night. There was clearly no beef. The way I view most of the people posting on this site is the way I view angry bouncers. You were the kid who got picked on in High School and bashing people is the way to get that anger out.I have been associated with nightlife for a long time. Like any business there are a lot of shitty people and shitty things that go on. However I ask everyone of you to ask yourself this....in your line of work, do people not pay their bills? do they pay late? do they do whats best for them? I have done a lot of different things in my life and I have always found the answer to those questions is yes.People are always bashing promoters as well. Why? If you are a bartender or waitress, yes a lot of these people don't tip but they are also filling the place allowing you the ability to make money. If you are a person going out, a promoter has 100% helped you out somewhere along the way. Stop bitching on promoters. No one give me that bullshit about how this place and that place doesn't have promoters. Every venue in NYC has a promoter and most owners were promoters before hand.

of course Danny is not gonna have beef with Evan, they have been friends for years! But reality is very simple!

How could anything that has nightlife's biggest scum bag behind the scenes, Jon Bakhshi, better known as Jew B ever be legit. The guy has been serving fake Grey Goose at his bars to costumers and promoters ever since he removed his lips from Robbie Wooton's cock. I'm surprised Grey Goose would allow their brand to be sabotaged all these years. Although since their doing mostly drug dealers party's, labeled as trendy by Danny Divine's master Jew B, I think one of them will experience how \"trendy\" promoters collect debt very soon.

ONLY Reason I took a look at this site is cause i heard someone talking smack about a good friend Danny Divine. 1. if your writing on this site as an employee and your disgruntled obviously you have no merit. 2. I dont know any club that gives the promoters any high end bottles usually its something the owner got as a promotion. 3. the promoters deserve to get NOTHING cause they arent bringing in any people as they should, other wise the place would be making money, and FYI your vodka grubbing LES friends dont count. 4. DANNY is a great guy and if you speak to people you will know that he has nothing but heart for what ever he does. 5. EVAN is a great guy but the only people he brought to a party was the party in his pants and the only person that came was him. 6. JUSKE is ana amazing DJ and obviously gets paid to DJ in other places as well as at MR. WEST so stop hating. 7. MESSKID is a great DJ but great DJs dont look for work!. 8. If your really posting on this site about the club I dont think you have relevance since your a loser posting on a blog about how you didnt get into a club. why dont you post your cell number and a note saying please get me in. 9. WHO the F is DAVID JAFFEE? probably some grade Z Promoter from LI. POINT being people get on with your lives stop hating and go have fun. If your not getting paid some where why work there. You must be retarded for doing so. and last but not least if you dont like going to a club, then dont go. Buy the DJ sample CD and sit at home pour yourself some real Grey Goose and enjoy.Clubs come and go.....But dont talk shit about people you dont know!!!!!!!!!!!

So to sum up the \"REALBLOWJOB\" we have:1) Employers do screw over even good employees at times so their maybe merit in someone's opinion.2) Regardless of the countless so called \"high end bottles\" promoters do receive, doesn't pouring that promotion vodka into a bottle of Grey Goose defeat the purpose of the promotion?3) Since the promoters bring nothing and the club isn't making money forces someone to conclude that it is very likely that they are in debt, owe people money and will be closed soon.4) Danny barely is a real owner. Being the figured head for Jew B doesn't make you do the owner, it makes you his bitch. I guess one can conclude although having not balls or money of his own Danny is a nice guy carrying out a scumbag's orders. 5) There's no need to comment since you made it clear that Evan's mother should have swallowed that load.6) Jus Ske is a perfect example of the trashier side of Manhattan that has been claimed trendy by HOME and Guesthouse standards. He demonstrates this industry's ignorance by having zero talent his refusal to bath so he can fit in and claim LES trendiness has catapulted his career.7) MESSKID is another perfect example of a talentless DJ who has downloaded every track possible from http://crooklynclan.net/. Just because you have a credit card and can afford to buy premixed songs and mash ups does not make you a DJ.8) I guess since your posting on this site your another loser that didn't get into a club and is a tad disgruntled?9) David Jaffe is an example of a loser who finds a few 16 year old girls to hangout with him by offering the free low grade alcohol and coke so that he can claim to be a promoter.

Everything is turning brown outside the Cooper Square Hotel, as the 5th Street neighbors abutting the great glass wang in the sky deal with scensters congregating on the multiple terrace spaces attached to both the lounge and Table 8. But long time East Village residents are not known to take much guff, so they have begun a guerrilla campaign to chase the vodka soda crowd away from their homes. Tactics to date have included screaming at people through megaphones, blasting arcane comedy routines over their home stereos, and our personal favorites, stringing a clothesline across the courtyard complete with soiled men's underwear. You can see it in the picture above! We aren't sure if the feces was real, or if it came from the woman or a nearby animal, but a gutsy move for a neighbor desperate for some R&R. The lesson here is that the Cooper Square knew they were going to have issues, and failed to mitigate them properly, either through design or cash payouts, and since it's too late to go back to the drawing board, we expect these problems to continue until Peck Moss comes up with some moolah to shut them up.

Our hats come off to Urban Daddy, who have released the most innovative iPhone guide to navigating our fair city. Instead of the standard neighborhood guide that gives you a choice of restaurant, bar, cafe etc., the Daddy has taken it just a bit further with The Next Move. The home screen displays the time and your location (Thursday morning at DBTH Worldwide HQ), and instead of you telling it what you are looking for, the Daddy asks you two wonderful questions: 1. What do you want? 2. Who are you with? What a novel idea! You then choose from a variety of categories, and then the magic box pumps out some helpful suggestions. Is it perfect? Of course not. But it is certainly a step in the right direction for those searching for improved means of navigating NYC. According to a Little Birdy at the Daddy, they will be continually pumping their intelligence data into the system, so those with iPhone power are always in the know. And now you know.

Never wanting to pass up an opportunity, we moseyed from one Queens spot to Dutch Kills, Sasha Petraske's latest cocktail den deep in the heart of Long Island City. Word to the wise, Dutch Kills is not close Studio Square. Walking in, one is smacked in the head with the Sasha vibe. The room is gorgeous, resplendent with dark wood, vintage light bulbs, quiet music, and a staff wearing ties ready to make your drinking dreams come true. The narrow room houses a few booths in the front for small parties and groups, an 8 seat bar in the middle, and a small parlor room in the back, housing a bench, 2 pianos, and a floor covered in sawdust. The drinks were delicious of course, mixing fresh ingredients with amazing chunks of ice to help refresh us after an afternoon of brews. The best part was the sub $10 price for each drink, one of the benefits of being in LIC. The worst part? Well, we were in LIC for a run of the mill cocktail lounge, something that is available on just about any neighborhood in Manhattan or Brooklyn. But not Queens. Aha! We expect this place to be a welcome haunt for LIC residents, and is worth checking out if you are in the hood. As for special trips out there, well, that's your call. [Photo Credit]

The holiday weekend was more than just glitzy parties and barbecues, it was also about setting records. A woman who was playing craps for just the second time in her life broke the record for the longest craps roll in the history of recorded gaming on Saturday night at the Borgata in Atlantic City, rolling 154 times in 4 hours and 18 minutes. This obliterated the previous record of 3 hours and 6 minutes set in Las Vegas in 1989, and crushes the DBTH record of 7 seconds recorded every time we try our luck. No word on total amount won, or if she celebrated by popping bottles at mur.mur, but it may be the sign we all needed that we are going to all make it.

Inspired by the beautiful Saturday afternoon sunshine, we hopped on the N for a quick ride into Queens to check out Studio Square, the new beer garden in the nether region between Long Island City and Astoria. Walking in, we were a bit overwhelmed by the sheer size of the space. The 18,000 SF yard is joined by a very large indoor area, along with 3 huge bars, multiple TV's, and a dedicated food area turning out above average beer garden fare. Oddly enough, the weather turned for the worse as soon as we walked inside, so a few heat lamps may have allowed us to stay at our table much longer than we did. The soundtrack could also use a pull into this century, as we heard way to many Jersey shore classics for our liking. Key fact - the building above Studio Square will not be more unsold housing. Instead the six floors is currently being converted into private event spaces, including a chapel/ceremony area and a roof garden that can be used for cocktail receptions. Tre clase Studio Square!

Le Souk to Rise Again

Bad news for Avenue B residents - Le Souk's liquor license has been reinstated. In a shocking decision, the New York State Appellate Division, First Department overturned a decision that resulted in the cancellation of Le Souk's license, saying it was \"not based upon substantial evidence because it relied on a \"guesstimate\" in determining that Le Souk was overcrowded on the night of Jan. 13, 2007.\" The holder of a liquor license is held under a high standard, and according to the law, \"must exercise a 'high degree of supervision' and will be held 'strictly accountable' for any violation\", so when Le Souk was busted for being overcapacity during the night in question, they were issued a code violation that led to their license being revoked. However, the Court ruled that just because Le Souk's owner, Sameh Jakob was present on the night of the violation, he did not knowingly permit the lounge to be overcapacity. The majority also question the validity of the officers scribbled summons saying \"300 people\" were in the room. Le Souk intends to reopen and will ask the liquor authority to re-issue the license. Full story after the jump![via NY Law Journal SS Req'd] Split Panel Faults 'Guesstimate' of Bar Crowd, Annuls Agency's Revocation of Liquor License By Daniel Wise May 22, 2009 The New York State Liquor Authority acted ultra vires in revoking a Lower East Side establishment's liquor license, a split panel of the Appellate Division, First Department, ruled yesterday. In the 3-2 decision, the majority found that the liquor authority canceled the license of Le Souk bar/restaurant on Avenue B based on two rules that are at odds with the rule-making authority the Legislature had given the agency. The revocation, the majority said, was not based upon substantial evidence because it relied on a \"guesstimate\" in determining that Le Souk was overcrowded on the night of Jan. 13, 2007. The majority annulled the authority's revocation of the liquor license.Justice James M. Catterson (See Profile) wrote for the majority in In re 47 Ave. B. East v. New York State Liquor Authority, 105195/08, that the rules on which the authority relied applied a \"no fault\" approach without \"the requisite element of awareness\" on the part of either Le Souk's owner or its top managers. The First Department decision appears on page 32 of the print edition of today's Law Journal.In dissent, Justice Peter Tom (See Profile) countered that Le Souk's owner was present on the evening liquor authority agents issued the violations and observed the overcrowding, and the owner did nothing to alleviate the condition \"until instructed by the police to restrict entry by patrons.\" The authority sustained three violations against Le Souk based on failure to exercise adequate supervision of the two-level establishment (9 NYCRR §48.2) and failure to comply with city regulations related to the level of occupancy of the premises, including building, fire and other local codes (9 NYCRR §48.3). Both of those rules as applied to Le Souk did not conform to the \"undisputed statutory predicate,\" Justice Catterson wrote, that \"[n]o person licensed to sell alcoholic beverages shall . . . suffer or permit [the licensed] premises to become disorderly,\" Alcohol Beverage Control Law (ABC) §106(6). Following a line of precedent, Justice Catterson noted, the Court of Appeals in 1992 had specifically concluded that the \"suffer or permit\" language of ABC §106(6) contains a \"specific mandate of an awareness element\" to sustain a disorderly conduct finding, Matter of Beer Garden, 79 NY2d 266. The supervision requirement (Rule §48.2) stipulates that the holder of a liquor license must exercise a \"high degree of supervision\" and will be held \"strictly accountable\" for any violation \"suffered or permitted\" on its premises by \"any manager, agent or employee or such licensee.\" It is \"patent\" under a \"plain reading\" of that rule, Justice Catterson wrote, that it \"improperly imputes an employee's knowledge of improper activity\" to Le Souk's owner, Sameh Jakob. The other rule, which bars violations of applicable New York City codes (Rule §48.3), Justice Catterson wrote, contains no requirement that the holder of a liquor license \"suffer or permit\" a violation. As a consequence, license holders can be held responsible for violating \"any one of a multitude of applicable governmental regulations\" even though there is no evidence that they knew about a violation, he concluded. Joining in the majority were Justices David B. Saxe (See Profile) and Leland G. DeGrasse (See Profile). In the dissent, Justice Tom, joined by Justice Karla Moskowitz (See Profile), found Le Souk distinguishable from Beer Garden because there was substantial evidence the owner, Mr. Jakob, was present at the time liquor authority agents and police officers observed overcrowding in the establishment. According to that evidence, Justice Tom wrote, Mr. Jakob did nothing to correct the condition and failed to properly oversee the doorman to make sure the occupancy limits specified in the bar/restaurant's certificate of occupancy were not exceeded (61 in the cellar and 135 on the main floor). The majority and dissent parted company over the question of whether there was substantial evidence to sustain a finding that Le Souk exceeded those limits on Jan. 13, 2007.Justice Tom found that the requirement of substantial evidence was met by the liquor authority investigator's testimony at an administrative hearing that there were \"approximately 75 to 100\" persons in the cellar and patrons were \"standing shoulder to shoulder\" throughout the premises. Justice Tom also noted that a police officer had issued a summons charging Le Souk with overcrowding that night, saying \"approximately 300 persons\" were on the premises. The judge added that the fact that the summons was later dismissed for failure to prosecute was not \"preclusive.\" 'Guesstimate'Justice Catterson saw the authority's evidence in a different light. The investigator's testimony that there were between 75 and 100 people in the cellar was nothing more than a \"guesstimate,\" he wrote, and could not be considered substantial evidence. He also rejected the notion that the police officer's notation that 300 people were present \"scribbled on a summons\" could constitute substantial evidence.Justice Catterson dismissed the dissent's reliance on the investigator's observation that patrons were \"shoulder to shoulder,\" writing \"it does not warrant further conjecture\" as to the potential for finding establishments throughout Manhattan liable for State Liquor Authority violations \"based solely upon evidence that patrons were standing 'shoulder to shoulder.'\" Article 78 challenges that administrative determinations were not based on substantial evidence - such as Le Souk's challenge to the State Liquor Authority's revocation of its license - are heard by the applicable department of the Appellate Division. Le Souk has been closed since shortly after its license was revoked said its attorney, Martin Mehler, of Mehler & Buscemi. He said Le Souk intends to reopen and that he will ask the liquor authority to re-issue the license. The liquor authority was represented by Scott A. Weiner of its legal staff.

Saying NYC is the wrong place for New Yorkers is moronic. New Yorkers can't allow the city to be taken over by a few scummy rich people trying to make money and not caring what they have to do to or who they have to step on to get their greedy hands on cash. Do these establishments provide a few jobs? Sure they do but these places interfere with a greater number of local residents lives than provides jobs. I don't think new York should not have clubs, I just think they need to be curbed and the club owners need to be mindful of how they affect neighborhoods. The noise and mayhem that places like Le Souk generate is intolerable.

We've picked up a new roving correspondent to check out some parties this summer. Last night, La Capitan hit up the Thrillist/Jet Blue party at Hudson Terrace to celebrate their new route to Jamaica. At 7:15pm, the line to get into the Thrillist party at Hudson Terrace was 200 deep. The crowd wasn't going anywhere: they had walked all the way to 12th Avenue for free rum and empanadas and there was no turning back. But the Fleet Week sailors knew better than to waste their time clawing for a free Dark and Stormy and kept walking. Naturally, we were able to cut the line and head straight up to the second floor bar and grab drinks. While there was no view to be had, there was plenty of Red Stripe, Jamaican wings, freeloaders, and the reggae sounds of Mojo Morgan set up by ubiquitous promoter-about-town JahFurry.The crush of the crowd kept spilling our drinks, but after we got liquored up and the party thinned out, we ran into way too many friends (oh hey Vice, Time Out New York, MTV...). The invite said over at 10, but security didn't drag the party out until well after 11. But the damage had been done. What we there for again? Who are we making out with? Is someone taking us to Jamaica? [Photo Credit]

Our good friends at Hotel Chatter invaded the Ace Hotel as paying guests to get the low down on the much hyped and much delayed space. How exciting! They loved the furniture, amenities, ambiance and low introductory prices (as did DBTH), but were a bit turned off by the location and dark rooms, but were generally in favor, saying \"For $199, this cannot be beat. Granted, after soft opening they will raise rates to $349 and up (except for the bunk bed rooms), but getting in now means enjoying something so new and so unique, while fearing not for your wallet.\"

While your rent may be dropping, the price of your booze may soon be rising. You can thank your federally elected representatives, who are considering legislation that will increase the federal excise tax on beer by 145 percent to more than $3 a case, 233 percent on wine, and an additional 20 percent on hard liquor. Seems fair. So either stock up now before the excise is increased, or get ready to have a little less change in your pocket. [NY Post]

never been a hampton fan. who wants to go to a club on the weekend in the hamptons??go to the beach and just go to a chill bar. we all live in nyc, so why does anyone feel the need to go to a bar filled with morons on the weekend out in long island. the weekend should be a break from partying in the city during the week when it really counts!! retarded.

definitely not georgica, not dune, pink will benefit because of being so close to west hampton, hamton bays, etc, like it always does and hopefully float the rest of their failing locations for another 3 months. lily pond will have a good saturday nite, nothing like last year, but good. but lily ponds problem is that with the massive team of partners, promoters, sub promos, pr, and comped tables there will be too little cake to make everyone happy in the end. surf lodge will do very well again (if the parking problems are figured out) because they have an actual product, and their hours of operation allow them much more chance to make money, then just 12-4 on saturday nites. i think clubs that concentrate on their nyc locations this summer are going to be the real winners. good luck to levine and georgica, seriously, that dudes gonna need it.

dr idiot, i obviously know many things you dont. theyve asked everyone in town, even other club owners to partner. either you're shilling for lily pond, or you have no clue about the facts. and as we all know promos and all 9 partners will have comp tables. i dont want to be rude and list the team of promos they are using though. but in all honesty they will still do well. and i wish all the places the best of luck

guys,enough is enough. no one really worked on lily pond last year besides the owners mike and Brian. to give them credit no promoter wanted to be there be4 the summer started because they were scared to be out east. Unik and team worked there too. but besides that there was nothing. Lily Pond did create the hottest Hampton venue from nothing, while pink and dune were the heavy favorites going into the summer. Be Fair, its true. I hope they do poorly because there staff at door are rude and assholes

Whoever wrote that Lilly Pond was just mike and brian last year is way wrong. Last year was Brian, Mike, Unik, Kyky, Mory, Joel and then Grieff and Marino who brought all the kids with money (and I mean kids). This year they have even more as they have added Richie, Scott, Ronnie and Jeffrey from 1Oak. Its a great team and with Phillipe being the restaurant, it should be a great saturday night spot.However, lets be clear about something....Pink Elephant is the best spot out there. It is for many reasons. First, all the places in the hamptons are barns. Pink Elephant happens to be the nicest of the barns. It has a great outdoor space which I heard has gotten a facelift and has added a actual bar out there. second, the crowd tends to be older then the crowd at the other venues, which for me is a big plus.Surf Lodge is not a club but, its great. same for sunset beach

Just as the Meatpacking District began its rebirth, could one of its heralded new clubs already be on its death bed? The answer is yes, sadly enough, since the one and only Arthur Kade invaded the Griffin this past weekend, saying he \"dropped $2,300 on bottle service for a great location at The Griffin. I was surrounded by super-models and so many gorgeous girls that I actually felt a bit overwhelmed, and the manager made sure to give me his card for next time I come. . . . It felt great to be in a room where I felt people matched up with how I look and act, and are ahead of the game. The atmosphere was great, and I even had a guy tell me outside the bathroom, \"You're a good looking dude\".\" That's just the scene we know most of you are looking for in a night spot.

Lol I'm happy you posted that, this guy must have had a bad childhood the way he talks about life and how proud he is of himself in such a public forum. His description of the party is pretty accurate but I doubt anyone gave two shits who he was, let alone knew who he was, besides the waitress who wanted to collect her gratuity at the end of the night. I'm mad that I missed spotting him in my treks to Griffin this past week, it would have been comical to see him in action. I like how he even boasts the monetary amount he spends... At the end of the day my real question is, if this guy is actually this successful actor/model, what is he doing going back and forth from Philly like that's a good place to live if you're trying to succeed in that industry.
Money Making
2009-05-19 14:06:00
Arthur Kade is an idiot. Why does he commute from Philly. Obviously if he had half a brain he would realize that in order to fulfill his (pathetic) \"modeling/acting\" career then he must do so here in New York or LA. The guy is a joke, I'm sure he will be blacklisted from every club soon, and I doubt the manager at Griffin knew who he was, otherwise he wouldn't have been let in.
Arthur Kade kisses Strippers
2009-05-19 14:10:00
A real class act!! Best kisser=Stripper in Minne\" I started thinking about this when I made out with the 9 at The Griffin who actually was biting me and trying to suck my tongue out of my mouth, and bit my tongue so hard that it still hurts to eat.I remember the best kisser I have ever had was a stripper in Minneapolis at “Sheiks” who I made out with for 2 hours in the Champagne Room in the back who was such a sexual kisser that I didn’t care how much it cost to keep her back there ($400 that night), because it was better than sex. \"www.arthurkade.com

2009-05-19 14:30:00
After a couple of decent times at Griffin (like the opening party which was pretty damn fine), I have to say that I was there Saturday night and it SUCKED! I don't read Kade's blog but a friend who does says he was there Saturday night. And all I can do is laugh if he thought that crowd was gorgeous and made up of supermodels! In fact it was so disinteresting and unattractive that I left after maybe 20 minutes - for sure never to return (on a weekend at least). Never mind the fact that the guy I think was Adam Hock rudely kicked my friend and I out of a seating area that wasn't even being used or needed at the time (we weren't even sitting, just standing).Too bad, I know some of the people involved (the ones who have the better reputations of the group), and while Id like to wish them well, that opening party was already their crowning achievement, and, to be honest, way above what they could ever hope for on a regular basis. It just ain't gonna happen.

Look, in all fairness, I think this guy is a joke, but if he showed up to Griffin, or any other club, and dropped 2300 on a table, he will get in. It just makes economic sense to do that. Put him in the back, let him hit on some girls. Lets face it, the guys that drop 4-5K on a table are not class acts and celebrities, they are bridge and tunnel people with successful businesses that have money and like to be ballers, but don't have the club connections to get hooked up. NONE of us here in industry would spend 3K on a table at Griffin, or Oak, or TJ, or any of these places because we know people, and we know better. If this douchebag asshat wants to drop 3K, even though he's a \"male model\" fuck - let him. More money for NYC nightlife! if he lived in NYC he'd probably be a promoter (ooohh, watch out Jaffee!) and would be posting about his comp table and free bottles, that would be WORSE!

Let's be real Griffin was over before it opened following in the footsteps of its dump of a cousin Room Service. Opening was smashing, but thats what you get when you pay every celebrity in your rolodex a boat load of money to show up. Room is gorgeous but since the place is darker that Club NY ever was and its only been open a short time I doubt it'll last long. I don't know about the rest of you but being in a room occupied by Pablo Escobar's homosexual fan club were all you can see are eyes and teeth isn't my idea of a hotspot.

Meet Michail Shimonov, college student, friend and alleged drug dealer, who was arrested while walking into Suzie Wongs on Saturday night with 88 pills of Ecstasy. He was one of eight other dealers arrested over the weekend, all part of groups who had mistakenly sold to undercover agents at Pacha and Rebel during an 8 month undercover operation. Our friend Michail and others like him are the reason that Nightlife Preservation Community groups and other organizations trying to promote the benefits of the industry will never be taken seriously. Dumb kids who act like jackasses are more of a lightning rod than a waitress who uses the job to pay rent and tuition, and every elected official will always come out against drugs and crime than for a hard working citizen. Just the facts. So until these low-rent clubs are willing to clean themselves up, good luck getting anyone to support making it easier or less expensive to open and operate here. [Photo Credit]

Tough times call for increased effort, so a Little Birdy we know decided to try their hand at bar tending a few nights a week to earn some extra cash. A noble effort. So our LB and a friend registered for a training and certification class at a local program, and made their way to Queens for their training. When asked what they learned, our Little Birdy replied that they had learned most of the classics, such as the Orgasm, Blowjob, Piece of Ass, Incredible Hulk, Adios Motherfucker, 1-900-Fuck-You-Up, and of course, the Abortion, which mixes 2 parts peach schnapps, 2 parts Baileys, and 2 or 3 drops of grenadine, producing a color that looks like...You get the picture. The real head scratcher isn't that these drinks exist, it's that the instructor deemed them to be so popular that the one and only instruction class was centered around making these obscure concoctions. Next time you go into a bar, pick any popular phrase or word and try ordering it from the bartender. Chances are, a recipe exists.

Quite a few bridge and tunnel as well as a large urban representation. It has lost that euro feel. I recognized promoters all over the place without the attractive patrons they used to bring in. In fact the majority of the well known promo guys have moved on. Did go downstairs to RDV for a drink. Attractive, older crowd. Very pretty room and bar where randy the host was spending his time. He used to sell the tables at kiss, but his A-listers arent going there anymore. Seems all good things must come to an end.\" How philiosophical of you LB. At least the name will live on in Texas.

I don't know what to make of this post. Bemoaning the \"old Euro feel\"? Not really sure I'd miss that. And I like the euphemisms.... Why don't you just come out and say what's on your mind, little birdy? \"Bridge and Tunnel\"?.... Translation: Italians from Brooklyn and Queens. \"Large urban representation\"? a..k.a. black peopleAll in all a sad reflection of NY nightlife in 2009: what kind of a f*cked nightlife universe are we leaving in where we have a hierarchy of \"desirable\" club patrons, with Eurotrash at the top, no less! The beauty of nightlife in the old days was that clubs thrived on the fact that they wanted to create as heterogenous a mix of people as possible, i.e., Wall Street bankers from the UES rubbing shoulders with B-boys from the Bronx. But then again, maybe the individuals who each represented each of these diverse social strands in 1989 were a lot more interesting than their 2009 counterparts.

oh get over it.we know exactly what the post meant by \"large urban presence.\"It didn't mean 'black people'.It meant the thuggish type people - who wear Jerseys, baggy pants, fitted caps and generally bring a not-so-friendly/not-so-sexy vibe to a club.In case you idiots haven't noticed - white black asian hispanic EVERY race have people that dress and act in this manner.I understand you COULD take it as \"oh, urban means black\", but come on - like you said, its 2009 - GET OVER YOURSELVES.

This is no surprise to me but at the end of the day these places have bills to pay... Anyone that can afford a table and is at least somewhat in the know isn't going to spend it at Kiss & Fly with loads of other trendier places in the neighborhood to drop money.In regards to Griffin, they seem to be doing very well... The crowd there has been consistently good, I saw Mory there on Friday with a bevy of models there as usual... Saturday I think they have Fabien & Bedis...

NYC needs another mega club.. hip hop room, house room, lounge area thats set up nicely and no status BS, ie: how many bottle, girls, whos guest list are you on type shit... The real NYs are frankly tired of that shit. I dont go clubbing as much as I used to I spend alot of times in low key cocktail lounges sipping on good tasing drinks, bars, and other smaller establishments, sourounding myself with good people that I enjoy their company.... But when I am looking to do it big I want a fuckin club, to dance, to let loose, to be comfortabley dressed without having to worry about all the bullshit I listed above. Thats not fun! Its actually a headache, It might be fun for the crowds that come in on the weekends, to get tables, ride in with their limos with and what not but when im looking to party i want to go all out.. I dont need a \"sceney\" club.. Clubs arent meant to be a look at me place.. Go to a lounge if you want that. Santos is a great \"club\" Dont get it twisted!

teabiscuit,EVERY single club in new york pays promoters to be there. Not one doesn't. 1oak has ellington and isiah, not to mention that richie akiva and ronnie madroff are promoters at the end of the day. Marquee and anything that is touched by strategic group is promoter driven. Tenjune, mory and ellington all work there. Every club that you have read about and has been discussed on this blog has promoters on their payroll. It sucks and so does nightlife now.

Just sit and watch or talk to these geeks, nerds, and dweebs. Silly. As far as Euro Trash. I mean, read the word. Who wants to party with these people all the time? What you really want is the hot women. Any club with HOT women is the place to be. Some people think HOT is tall. slender, pretty model types, and others think it is the porn star type.

New to dbth and I've been working with the 13th street ent (aka KissnFly, RDV, Bagatelle) guys from inception. Without trying to come across biased since obviously I am paid to hang but as for the vibe - it really hasn't changed since we started. I say and know this because every table nearly sells out thur - sat btwn each spot. To be perfectly honest, I've never truly been impressed by what the other promoters bring & what types of general admissions walk in. But i will say this; I never have complaints when having dinner in bagetelle with its always fun to watch the cougars dance on their tables (not too mention I highly recommend prob one of the best cucumber mojitos in the city) then moving down to RDV which is more refined to above average vibe followed by heding upstairs to jump around wasted to house (and i even make jokes about some of the cheesy tracks). I def wouldn't suggest doing all three in a row week to week which will obviously be monotonous as $hit but hitting any of these individually at dif times isnt that bad at all. Trust me these guys know what they are doing which is why I continue to work with them despite other offers from the aforementioned clubs. PS: I think its really weak to name trash people and not support it with your identity. Didn't your mom ever teach you guys that if you don't have something nice to say, don't say anything @ all? -Hints

In this weekend's On the Market in NYC, the Times featured this charming 1 bedroom apartment at 237 Edridge Street in the Lower East Side. Although it's small, the unit boasts \"bright light from four windows facing a courtyard, with a hint of sky. Original wood moldings offer a nice contrast to the newly installed bamboo and checkerboard floors. Storage space is surprisingly ample, with big built-ins over the captain's bed and vintage cabinets in the kitchen.\" And don't worry about the noise from the nearby bars, this starter Co-op is on a quiet block away from Hell Square, unless you count oh, the Eldridge, which is just a few doors down at 247 Eldridge. But don't worry, they only have 13 years left on their lease, so call your local bank and get that loan application started. [Photo Credit]

Weeks after proclaiming that the Beatrice Inn would arise from its shuttered state like a dancing Phoenix, our favorite old girl has yet to open for business. One Little Birdy with more than a bit of snark writes: I walked by good old Bea last night to see it completely dark with a large plastic trashcan still guarding its exclusivity which seemed to have been carelessly thrown down those holy stairs that once embodied everything to hate about NYC nightlife. What a shame, this must be really heartbreaking to those across the river in Williamsburg. Unfortunately, I was only at Bea' once because my jeans were never tight enough, my shoes never bright enough and my penis never small enough. Zing. Adding to the misery, last night's rumored Save the Beatrice party II at the Bowery Hotel never came together. Misery does indeed love company. At least we have the Chelsea. [Photo Credit]

The 500' Rule in Peril
***AUTHOR

***DATE
2009-05-15 10:10:00
***CONTENT
For years, Community Boards and the SLA used the 500' rule, which required someone who wants to serve liquor within 500 feet of three or more other establishments that serve liquor to attend a hearing and prove it would be in the public's best interest, to help deny numerous operators from gaining a permit. But a little known ruling from 2008 judged that the SLA had been wrongly applying the rule, saying that the rule applied only to establishments within the same category. The State Legislature may take up the matter soon, hoping to draft a law that will more resemble the \"4 licenses within 500'\" spirit, but as of now, it's open season. The takeaway? There has never been a better time to get a permit in what's known as an over-saturated area, because the SLA still has no clue what type of license each venue should have. Go! [Downtown Express]

this and many other nightlife related legislation minefields are the topics at nyna meetings. on june 22 an event will be held at m2(mansion) for the industry,this will be a free but invitation only event with celeb dj's , entertainment, free cocktails and food. owners bartenders, waitrons, publicists etc will be invited. the purpose of this event will be to bring attention to an initiative called the nightlife preservation community. this group will utilize the extensive email text messaging etc lists and marketing skills of the club community to influence outcomes of primary elections. it is in these primary elections where small amounts of voters can swing the outcome to nightlife favorable candidates. we have already gathered some 500,000 names and we are including more people and groups everyday.the dangers of a 2am license or other harmful legislation looms and only through the power of the vote can we hope to change things. a website will be set up to keep opt in members informed of nightlife related happenings. there will even be listings where owners can meet potential staf.more information will be available in a couple of weeks

Correction: there has never been a WORSE time to file for a permit than right now. In the wake of the SLA's corruption scandal and subsequent personnel/policy changes, the system is hopelessly backed up. Apply today, you might be serving summer of 2012.

uncle stevie, why do you and nyna never place blame on the club owners? yes, nightlife is fundamental and crucial to the health of nyc . . . yet the \"dangers of a 2 am license loom\" because too many club owners have cheaped out on security, soundproofing, cleanup and door policies. the biggest change in ny nightlife in the last 10 years is not bottle service and bankers; it's toddlers. every part of manhattan is now filled with families started by dyed-in-the-wool nyers who decided to make the city their home instead of just their playground. this is great for the city and for restaurants, retailers, etc. this baby boom generates far more revenue for the city than the clubs - and far more revenue for nightlife than clubgoers. toddlers and clubs must be balanced. the way to do it? NO NOISE ON THE STREET. keep it inside and no one cares. skimp on soundproofing, hire security that ignores the street, allow thuggery, fail to provide space for your smokers, and you have a problem. zero street noise is very possible, it's just more expensive. responsible, well-funded operators who view themselves as part of their communities, instead of transients hoping to make a quick buck for a few years, understand this. everyone else should be denied a cabaret license.

One of the least loved music venues in New York got perhaps the best feature, as Terminal 5 opened up its amazing roof bar space last night. The space sports a plethora of seats, full bar, and bathroom, allowing concert goers to grab some respite from the hot mess that is Terminal 5. Despite the plethora of signage inside the venue, the large space never got too crowded last night, although we imagine that the pending heat of summer may change that going forward. [Photo Credit]

I hear Matt Levine likes to badmouth people around the neighborhood from a few reliable sources and i am truly sick of hearing his name. Since the PR conception of him in our nightlife indusrty, I've seen him as a character, kind of \"Where is Waldo.\" A joke if you will. Never have I or anyone I work with said anything bad about the Eldridge or Waldo until now. Dude is a clown and has no experience or merit for talking smack about anyone. Waldo, you are a guest in our neighborhood down on Eldridge St, stop talking shit. $24 gold leafed drinks??? I'll bet they are flying over the bar.FW

I think once an area becomes over in nightlife terms it stays over for some time. People like the illusion that they are going out to someplace cool. For example the Upper East Side and Midtown were once great nightlife districts (you have to go back to pre-Vietnam War days) and once these areas lost it, they lost it. The Meatpacking District might make a comeback in 2030.That is also the problem with what is happening East Village and LES. If current trends continue, we will be in a situation where the East Village is known as the place where NYU kids go to party for decades. The more bohemian past will just be forgotten.

27th st has finally reached rock bottom, with griffin, the new lotus, and 675 in addition to the places currently open, meatpacking is the mecca of new york nightlife, at least for now.

@ ED, If the MEPA, LES and East Village have all seen their prime and wont be coming back until 2030 then where do you suggest going? No... People from Manhattan will not be commuting out to Williamsburg. I agree with James Goldman, MEPA has reached rock bottom, some new places are opening that seem to have a bright future. Sure 27th street might always be terrible but the Meat Packing district as a whole will always have a nuance that attracts high end clubs and hopefully good people.

\"ED, If the MEPA, LES and East Village have all seen their prime and wont be coming back until 2030 then where do you suggest going? \"Philadelphia? Seriously, I think the next go-to neighborhood will be in Manhattan, south of 96th Street, but will come out of nowhere and won't emerge for a few years. There are all sorts of government policies and demographic trends that work against having a decent scene right now. I'm interested in what happened in the gap between the disappearance of the post WWII scene, which seems to have been mainly in Midtown, and the emergence of the punk scene in the 1970s.

Have you ever wondered how all of these bars that open on a shoestring budget always seem to look so darn cool? Do you think to yourself, \"gee, I want to open a bar but where would I get my cool decor?\" Let us spray some wisdom on you. The secret to finding the amazing antiques and vintage wear at bargain basement prices is the Brimfield Antique show in Central/Western Massachusetts. The place is multiple football fields long, packed to the gills with New Englanders hawking all kinds of furniture and fixtures that would look great in an overpriced commercial space in Two Bridges or Bushwick. So rent some U-hauls, corral some buddies and bring a bunch of cash (we hear the Ace Hotel team gave a bunch of people $10,000 each when they went Brimfield hunting) and prepare for the shopping spree of a lifetime. The show runs from May 12 - 17, and don't think the rainy forecast will keep people away. Happy hunting!

***CONTENT
The Chelsea in Atlantic City opened to strong reviews last year, but the economic downturn surely battered their financial projections. Heading into summer #2, where a beach hotel hopes to maximize its revenue, the Chelsea is tinkering with its hospitality program. They have reprogrammed the famed 5th Floor by introducing the Cabana Club, which strives to bring the Vegas style pool club to Atlantic City. The 8 cabanas are still in full effect, but they have been spruced up with plasma's, mini-bars and Play Stations. The pool area also now has a full DJ booth and performance stage, perfect for a relaxing afternoon by the sea. The indoor game room and lounge have been combined into a single room that can be closed off for an event or opened into the outdoor deck to create a larger venue. Will these changes and an attempt to lure a more Philly/South Jersey client base spell success for the Chelsea? Who can really know, but these are strong steps to keep luring new clients away from the Borgata and Water Club.

The Lower East Side, West Village, and Long Island City all sport their own Sasha Petraske cocktail den. Is Philly next? According to a Little Birdy, the answer is a resounding yes, telling DBTH: Was at the bar at Death and Co. last night and overheard one of the bartenders (young guy, blond hair) talking about a new bar the Death and Co. folks are opening in Philly. Said it was going to be a similar layout to Death and Co. and called the Franklin Mortgage and Investment Company (1920 gangster founded investment bank used to launder money led by one of Arnold Rothsteins people) In fact, the Franklin Mortgage and Investment Company was run by Max \"Boo Boo\" Hoff, a dominating figure in the Philadelphia gambling and boxing arena's, who was labeled the \"King of Philadelphia's Bootleggers\", but never indicted for any crimes. No word on a project timeline or location, but you can bet your bottom dollar that Arthur Kade will be covering the opening for DBTH. UPDATE: Our bad - this has nothing to do with Sasha and the Milk and Honey team.

Erin, not sure if you were being sarcastic, though I'll assume you weren't. I've spent some time in Philadelphia, having gone to school there and back a few times in recent past, there seems to lack an audience for expensive / artisinal cocktails - it has wildly different demographics than a New York / LA / Chicago, hence why the nightlife has always been so remarkably different (and/or lackluster, depending on your perspective). That being said, perhaps I just overlooked a public clamoring for just such a place.

So we know that the Gates has been holding some preview events leading up to its launch, but today we received our first response from a Little Birdy who checked the space out this weekend. LB, tells us what you thought: Went to the opening of The Gates this weekend, it was pretty happening. Surprised you guys have not covered this venue at all. Sounds like it might turn into a pretty douchy place, but the venue is nice. Mix of Hipster and socialites. It was a free open bar, no complaints on my end, besides the poor choice of music. Well, any place that has an ambassador program really isn't for us. We're of, by and for the people. Unless we're talking about members only roof bars. Hypocrites! [Photo Credit]

I went on Saturday and was taken aback by the quality of the staff, the bartenders especially. The people were gorgeous and the space is great. I'm glad to be a member (a friend of mine is one of their ambassadors), though they really need to work on the music. The DJ was awful. In New York, everyone likes exclusivity and I believe that The Gates will be on the same level of Rose, Goldbar, and Bijoux during its first 6 months. If they don't continue to add members, though, people will eventually be bored of the same venue, I believe.

hahahaha
2009-05-12 12:44:00
Goldbar?! When it opened Jamie and Jayma stated how they were NOT opening a club. It would be a place to get a drink, like Rosebar. Fast forward two years; you have animals dancing on the furniture, on Sunday it is a disgusting, very brooklyn (bensonhurst brooklyn that is) crowd. Rose Bar it is not. Rosebar has been able to maintain some level of class and although their door policy is no where near as tough as it was when it opened THREE YEARS AGO, the room is filled with a good crowd, even on a friday night. As for The Gates, I was asked to be an ambassador and I will be very frank; I do not see this, or any \"Club\" succeeding in this economic environment unless they have an ENORMOUS financial backer (i.e Strategic Group has their money guy Marc Packer). High end restaurants are empty (Per Se, Le Cirque, Masa) and they provide an actual service and product. Hotels such as The Gramercy or The Greenwich Hotel are bemoaning the fact that they are only booking 40% of their rooms and you have Ago, with all the Hype Deniro and co could muster, closing in less than 8 months. Clubs? Selling a bottle of vodka for $550 (after tax and tip) when you can buy it for $20 at a liquor store doesn't make ANY sense. I wish anyone that opens a business well, but the times call for something different.

The last thing this city needs is another club with cheap chandeliers and expensive drinks. It was empty. The bartenders took for ever to make foursimple cocktails. Dudes clad in Diesel tshirts hitting on girls who think they're hot... all around not a good look. Not only did it slow my night down, but now I wonder if the so called friend who brought me here is really a friend.

Is America's love affair with absinthe already over? After waxing poetic about the powerful green liqueur with the supposed magic powers during its decades long ban, the anise flavored spirit was legalized in 2008, flooding the market with absinthe brands who were certain US imbiblers would go gaga for the green. Not so fast. It turns out our simple palates don't enjoy really enjoy the taste of the stuff and never really did, which is a bit of a problem. Eric Felten himself says he is \"neither particularly fond of absinthe nor the least bit acclimated to it, which makes me an imperfect judge of these demanding spirits. Lucid, in particular, tastes to me like an herbalist dumped his collected pharmacopoeia into a blender with Everclear and olive oil.\" A ringing endorsement if we have ever heard one. So while mixologists will continue to tinker with the green as a cocktail ingredient, don't expect a third wave of absinthe enthusiasts demanding absinthe service to overtake our tap rooms.

Absinthe is nearly identical to pastis (Ricard, 51, etc,) Americans never drank any pastis because the strong anis taste doesn't go over well with us. In the south of france, (and other places along the mediterranean) kids grow up drinking it but it's not hugely popular beyond those areas. Also, it's a very distinct strong flavor that doesn't lend itself well to mixing - pastis and absinthe, ouzo, etc, will never be more than a niche market.

Absinthe seems to be most popular with kids who heard that it's \"like mushrooms and alcohol combined, man!\" in college. Then after college, they took a trip to Europe, tried it, puked, and came home to America talking about how hard they \"tripped out\" on it, even though it doesn't fucking work like that Dan, ow many fucking times do I have to explain this to you?!Sorry, I blacked out for a second there.

These drinks are all holiday or cocktail drinks. I remember drinking ouso on a holiday to corfu in Greece and it was good for a few drinks but it had a high alcohol content and we got drunk on it very easily. The locals on the other hand drank it like water. We brought a bottle home with us but never really touched again.

The exciting life of Arthur Kade doesn't stop for a minute, including his invasion of Kiss and Fly. Let's get his recap: I am not a huge fan of [Kiss and Fly], but the last two times it has been great, and the crowd was hot last night, and our table was on the dance floor, so girls were coming up to me non-stop to talk. At one point, I looked at the table, and we had three bottles going (Two of which were comped by the club), and had 12 girls hanging with us. I talked to a Brazilian model throughout the night that was here on vacation, she could barely speak English and was a 9, and if I were staying in NYC, I would have had a fun night with her, but I had to drive home to take care of some stuff in the morning. If that's a 9, then we know some lady boys in Phuket who would blow his doors off.

I actually love when Down by the Hipster posts this guys stuff. Its classic. I've never seen anything like this and I've been online following the self absorbed for many years now. This is amazing. I wonder if he just write this stuff to post weird ramblings on his blog or does he delude himself into believing that clubs want him up front because he’s a male model with (perceived ) great looks and he’s cool, the life of the party, lots of hot chicks want to be around him, etc. Does he really think that he’s got some kind of magnetism? I mean, he’s an ugly guy in my opinion. I’m hetero but if I thought that he truly had great looks I wouldn’t say that. He’s ugly. He’s also probably a very superficial guy. I’m into reading so for me, I couldn’t sit with this guy for too long. I would need some real conversation and he seems so phony. Is he covering up some deep insecurity? Why is he compelled to tell us that he got comp’ed a few bottles or how they placed him at the front table or how hot chicks are drawn to him. He has no humility.

It looks like Brooklyn is poised for two new bars, both brought to you by the owners of Commonwealth. First up in Prospect Heights is Sharlene's, wait for it, named after Sharlene, a bartender at Commonwealth and partner in her very own space. Congrats. Next is High Dive, opening in the former Lighthouse space on Fifth Avenue in the Slope. A real Brooklyn bar empire in the making. [GastroChic]

We know beer pong games can get pretty intense, but they should never get this crazy. According to reports, a beer pong game at a Philadelphia home between Joseph B. Jimenez (pictured) and Scott Riley turned deadly after Jimenez accused Riley of a rule violation. Afterward, the two met up in a alley, where Jimenez pulled a gun and fatally shot Riley in the neck. Holy Jeebus. His original explanation that \"my gun fell out of my waistband and accidentally shot someone\" didn't get him too far with police. We are sure many of you have played a game of BP before; what could the violation have possibly been? Foot foul? Not rinsing the ball off? Let's get it together people.

A trip to the desert isn't really complete without checking out one of the numerous gentleman's clubs that are prevelant in Las Vegas. Seeing that Rick's Cabaret had made such a splash both in New York and Las Vegas, why not see what they had to offer. The club itself was nice in a standard way; two floors, loud music, drinks, and ladies hustling to show you a good time. Not standard are the Rick's Party Buses that pick up customers at hotels, allowing the company to outsmart the city's taxi drivers who are charging clubs between $70 and $100 for bringing clients to the shop. On your next visit, save yourself some money and increase your fun by calling ahead for a roundtrip ride on the shuttle.

***CONTENT
The shortest six hour flight we've ever taken on Virgin America left us with plenty of time to catch some sun by the Palazzo pool and adjust to PST. Crucial. While chatting with our cocktail waitress and the pool manager about the Thursday night hotness, it became clear that the night was owned by Tao. It is so dominant that rival club managers that we met told us not to bother checking out any other spot, and if they could take the night off, they would be there too. Nuff said. Team DBTH rested up and headed over to the Venetian hot spot, where we found a massive crowd angling to catch anyone's attention. What truly amazed us was the number of staff working the line, mostly security, junior door staff and promoters, searching for the right crowd and those who were interested in buying bottles. Controlled chaos at its finest. Of course, we quickly rolled right through to our table above the dance floor. Natch. The size and organization of Tao is truly remarkable, especially when you realize how much of it is for sale on a nightly basis. Many times the purchase of a table really is nothing more than a table with enough seating for two or three people, which allows for additional tables to be installed and sold, and to keep most of the crowd on its feet the entire night. Not a problem on this night, because the place was going off just fine. Within minutes, the bottles of Don Julio arrived, and because this is a town that loves to take care of its guests, there was always a staff person on hand for whatever was needed. Our favorite part was being escorted across the club to the front of the bathroom line, because when you got to go, you got to go. The music was good and loud, the crowd was up and moving, and a good time was had by all. Late into the evening, the DJ let it slip that Jay Z would be showing up at Lavo the next night, which certainly got our attention. We left around 3:30, which was definitely early, to hit the tables. Night one was wrapping up, but the weekend was just getting started.

bottom line is, strategic group operate the most successful clubs in the country and as individuals, both noah and jason have great reputations. in addition, they have created such a long-term successful business that there has even been an hbs case study about them. many of us don't go to marquee (although we did at one point), but these guys have just earned the respect of their peers. that's it. they're legit.

I really don't think that this is a paid for plug bec DBTH is calling it how they see it. I myself came back from experiencing TAO Vegas for the 1st time 2 years ago, and the customer service there is impeccable. These \"door people\", and \"bottle hosts\" here in The Rotten Apple should go out there to take a HOSPITALITY Lesson or TWO from people in out Vegas. They really know how to take care of customers that have money to spend, not like the shit that's here in NYC.

Destination Bar, the soon to open bar and restaurant in the former Boys Room space on Avenue A, took to the Tweet to provide a crucial update on its pending service. We're talking cocktail flavored jello shots, with DB saying \"We are expanding beyond Jello-rita shots. Today, we're experimenting with Cosmo and Fuzzy Naval Jello shots. Will let you know how it goes.\" Hell. Yes. Combine this with simple bar snacks, a+ desserts and a drink program that is under $10 a pop, and Destination Bar could already be a new fave.

Last night's opening party at Griffin was easily one of the best parties I've been to in a while, especially for a club opening - but with Amy, Julia and IMG hosting, no surprise there. The crowd was the perfect mix of creatives, fashion folks, socialites and models - it reminded me of Bungalow in it's glory days. Coleman killed it, and the space is gorgeous, comfortable and just feels good. It remains to be seen if Josh, Manny et al can consistently draw that crowd, but last night was awesome!

The Garden has been open and has been a nice spot for a few weeks now. Satsky and his idiots write stuff on this blog because he thinks this site really matters. Yes PAIGE is running the garden until China Grill decides to renovate. Who cares how long that is or what the reason is. And who cares who Matt Shendell is. The Garden is open and seems to be running fine. Thats all that matters. Please blog the truth on here or this site is a waste of everyones time.PAIGE's website is www.paigegroupny.com so go check for yourself what links work and what doesnt.From what I know, Satsky hasnt done anything right in this business. His restaurant SMOKED was a joke, Stereo lost a ton of money and he hasnt done sh*t since then. Stop hating and everyoe get their facts straight.

Live Nation is hoping to dump the lease for the Gramercy (Blender) Theater on 23rd Street, just a few years after completing a hefty renovation of the space. The 600 seat space is a choice of last resort for most major acts in town that would seek a venue of this size, with many acts choosing to perform in one the Bowery Presents facilities. If you have ever dreamed of running your own music venue, now is your chance.

The wait is over. Matt Levine's redo of the restaurant space in THOR will be called Levant East. We aren't sure if it's related to Levant in London, a Lebanese restaurant that is very east of Levant East, but you never know what this marketing genius will try next. Coming in May. UPDATE: A Little Birdy breaks down the name Levant East, saying \"Levant (meaning lower / rising) in French, and east, to represent and fuse together French and American cultures. The plan is to create a cuisine which will be French (Levant) American (East), meaning the Lower / Rising of the East side, the growth of the Lower East Side.\" It's a head scratcher for us because we don't speak French, but we kind of get where they are coming from. Kinda.

Leave it to a cheeky New York bartender to capitalize on the Swine Flu craze that has swept the globe. While fretful parents and talking heads worry about the available quantity of a vaccine, a Little Birdy sent in this offer of a Swine Flu shot for just $4. Meanwhile, will the outbreak of the dreaded virus in Queens be another strike against the much maligned Bridge and Tunnel crowd, making Manhattanites want to avoid them even more during the weekend? Probably, because people are irrational. We love us some Queens.

Interesting thoughts. Yes Chris R has a terrible reputation for not paying people (well deserved), a lot of promters and DJ's wont touch the space. I don't know that Kiki and Unik have anything left of their A-list crowd, after Bijoux fell flat. I think Griffen will be ok just because the MDP is running low on higher-end options, and Kiss isn't doing much to stay fresh, but its a tough move to open in summer before the A crowd goes to the Hamptons. They will have to defend against the Dirty Jerz until summer ends.

I feel like all of the trendier clubs are opening themselves up to these B&T promoters on off nights to bring in cashflow... If I'm Joe Guido from Long Island I'd rather party in a trendy club on an off night (keep in mind they don't know it's an off night), then Home or Guest House and the like on the same night. Easy way to generate revenue if promoted the right way....

Leave it to the Master of the Cock Tease to unveil the American outpost of a Japanese speakeasy. Grub Street brings work that the Bohemian will open at 57 Great Jones and will only distribute 200 membership cards to a select few. The plans include a small plates menu and cocktails from the Angel Share and B Flat team, but since there are over 8 million residents, we're guessing that most of you may never get a chance to sample the goods.

It's just mind boggling that anyone believes this place will only have 200 members. Maybe the Bohemian thinks it can get away with with having only \"200 members\", but like all speakeasy's even the best (M&H) you need to keep your doors open in order to attract the business. Sure it's 200 members might keep the place going for the first 2-3 months until they are too bored of it and the owners realize that this business scheme does not work. But to think that a speakeasy can be profitable with only 200 members while needing to cover rent, expenses, staff, overhead and those damn expensive liquor licenses is foolish. I bet I'll be able to make a \"secret reservation\" to this join in the next month or so.

Last week, DBTH made a walk down Freemans Alley to get some spring cocktail loving. Good call. Good call. The updated menu features concoctions that are light, smooth, with a hint of fruit. Most importantly, they are delicious. A few favorites were the Brazilian Cup, made with Cachaca dark rum, lime juice, cream of coconut, whole mace garnish and the Bangkok Buck, made with Thai rum, ginger, pineapple juice, lime juice, peychaud bitters. The menu also features the Perfect Gin and Tonic (they may be right!), and two booze friendly desserts from the revamped kitchen, a Stout Sticky Toffee Pudding and a Bourbon Custard with Pecan Shortbread. Thank the Lord for spring.

I was surprised to see Nick at the door, but Hector Longoria (Cain) is a managing partner who's also doing the door. That brings some much deserved credibility to the space... & with Rachel Uchitel (Tao Vegas) and Josh Kaiser (Pink Elephant) involved also as managing partners... I'm excited... The space looks and smells great... It has that new club smell which fades quickly with cigarettes and vomit. From what I understand, Thursday will be the official grand opening, last week was essentially a soft opening where private parties were held and friends of the staff came to check the place out...

The Main partners at Griffin are Adam Hak, Chris Reda and Stevie D from Vegas. All of the \"partners\" that James listed have a minimal stake in the place or are owners in name only. I would expect the place to get off to a fast start but fizzle out quick. there are too many other spots opening by more established people in the business.
Money Making
2009-04-27 15:47:00
For real, I do agree with you that there are probably some better people in the Business. But why would more established people be looking to open places in this economy? Griffin and all the \"exclusive\" nightclubs that are owned by these \"established\" people are hurting, and it makes little sense to keep opening them at this time, plus the financing just isn't there... The bottle service model is hurting, or I would imagine it to be.
NotTonightSorry
2009-04-27 16:56:00
I stopped by Friday. The energy is good, the club itself is beautiful and the crowd was nice. I think they'll do well because despite the dismal economy, people still go out. There are a lot of venues currently operating, but only a couple of them are actually fun to GO to. The Griff, along with the new Earth space will probably be the hottest and most fun in the city this summer and beyond. Peace.

Money Making, you have to remember 1 thing. When you are dealing with the people who go to the smaller more elite places (i.e. 1Oak) you are usually talking about the top 1% of all people who go out to clubs. Many of those people have generational type money. It's like people who say the Hamptons will be slow. Most of the people who spend money in the Hamptons or in the smaller places in the city cannot spend their money in a lifetime. Yes you lose out on some of the bankers who were the icing on the cake but the big guy, the whale spending 10-20K a night is not hurt the same way by this market.Griffin looks good and the crowd will be solid in the beginning. I just think that with places like double seven, the earth space, the new lotus and all the outdoor spaces all opening within the next 3 months, griffin has the most to do to catch up.
Money Making
2009-04-27 19:05:00
I'm looking forward to going to Griffen. I think it's a common consensus with everyone that last summer too much spending went on. I no longer feel the need to buy bottles to go out, it's pointless. Places still let you in, especially when they know you. In the past money was thrown around easily, if someone at the door \"hustled\" you for a bottle you always said yes, now it's different. No matter who you are you're still thinking about reducing expenses. Everyone's portfolio has gone down at least 20-30% in the last 12 months, sure things are better now, and it's coming back, regardless it's still down a significantly from a year today.

@ I dont think so: In most cases you're right, however in this case Hector leaving Cain was a clear signal that even Cain/Cain Luxe has been invaded by the trash that it's neighbors on 27th street bring along. Cain was the last glimmer of hope for 27th street, and Hector ran a good place, his leaving I'm sure was in large part due to the crowd Cain was bringing in.

James Goldman. What are Hector and Jamie up to these days? Where are they working?
CORRECTION!!!!
2009-04-28 16:42:00
Just to make a correction on JAMES and MONEY MAKING!!!From what I know, the guy from Pink and the rest of the mob sqad...ARE NOT A PARTNERS JUST EMPLOYEES!!From what I know Reda and his team are main holder and Steve and Adam do have ownerships.As far as Nick doing the door, dont know the comment on his dress code, if you know a little fashion, his gear is pretty tight. He is a true NY city kid unlike many of the door guys, and people dont like him becuase he does the door right. I am sure he can care less what any of us say anyway.I do like that one other guys that worked at Cain, he is a good look as well and they both look great at the door.The girl is the only thing I dont get...never really seen her before and she sure needs a makeover on her wardrobe, at least what I saw on Saturday, especially standing next to the other two guys, but it aint my club.I hope they do well. Good location, I was there Saturday-cool space.Hopefully, they are smart and don't whore it out and it looks like another club added to the shit list. NY needs a small venue where the adults can go because NY is sure lacking it!!!!!

I dont personally know him but seen him out at B Inn and Rose Bar... Just wondering becuase he seems to be in a different scene from the main stream commercial club land type of guy.I was at Griffin on Friday, place is amazing but hopefully they can do better in the music end for the opening. I heard it was their practice weekend. Was pretty dope. Did not see Nick at door, but agree, he is a good look.Great location.Wish them the best.
Table answer

2009-04-28 22:07:00
not sure who any of you idiots are but if you have worked in the NY nightlife scene for more than 3 mins you would know that Adam, Steve and Chris are all slugs.Google Steve D/pure management and IRS and watch out!! chris is truly a good guy at heart but doesn't know the first thing about running a business and Adam just wants a little return on his previous investment and wants to get laid.Manny is a hanger-on and needs a shower.the space was done beautifully i have to say. Dizon and Lewis did wonders with it. one of the better looking places around now.As far as Nick at the door, he's a class act. been around a minute and always pleasant to speak to no matter the situation. rachel is a psycho and no one should ever trust her. She was involved with major drama in Vegas and isn't allowed within 20 feet of the Tao.My advice; Fire rachel immediately, get your money in the form of a cashier's check if you work there and Manny still needs to shower.good night all!

The quality of women at the Plumm never reached a Kade 10. It was a New York 8, which is a Philly 10, but every girl i ever took home was not properly groomed, making them Kade 2's. I hope when Noel reopens, he hires binn and consults me on which women to let inside.

Plumm was good for the first 6 months out of that 4 1/2 years. then it turned into something out of a jermanine dupri video.

Plumm as a venue is a great space. Two sets of steps to go up and down on both end of the venue make it so functional. I hope whatever goes in here next utilizes the place for what it is...but I do think that whole block or two is done...Manor is closed...Country Club is on its last leg...It is almost like a Greenhouse...nothing around it...so whatver comes next must be cool, because it's cool and not rely on club hoppers to come by

Matt Levine: Savior of THOR!

DBTH

***CONTENT
Matt Levine is many things to many people. Clothing designer, television star, bar owner, philanthropist, philosopher. You get the drift. But now it seems we can add savior to the list. According to a tweet by a man with some free time on his hands, Levine has been tapped by The Hotel on Rivington to take over its cursed restaurant and bar space, which has churned through multiple chefs and operators since its opening in 2004. We turn to our friends at Eater for some of the history. August, 2006 - Original chef Kurt Gutenbrunner departs to concentrate on his other restaurants August, 2007 - The entire restaurant area is gutted, hoping for a fresh start October 2007 - Mark Spangethal is installed as the third chef, replacing Kevin Pomplum October, 2007 - The secret bar area is re-christened Bar 105 May, 2008 - Jesi Solomon is announced as the fourth chef Solomon was firmly in place by the end of summer, 2008. By April 2009, the concept was trashed, ready to be turned over to Matt Levine, a newcomer with a much debated business model. Four chefs in four years is enough to make an owner do crazy things. But is it crazy, or is it just crazy enough to work? Further analysis and a comment by Matt Levine himself after the jump. What THOR has always had going for it is its location, smack dab in the heart of the LES that is still packed with bars, restaurants and visitors. But its major flaw is the design. The restaurant is the lobby, while most hoteliers like to clearly separate the two uses, and restaurateurs like to have an independent space that they can program on their own. THOR has never overcome this, and it will continue to plague the space. On the plus side, the 105 bar area has always been a nice little room, and the always empty second floor bar area with the sofas and giant windows has always been a nice place to grab a drink and people watch. We would recommend doing as much as possible to utilize that space, create a cocktail, wine and small plates menu that makes the venue more casual and remove the sit down dining atmosphere, and play to the strengths of the location. As for Levine, he tells DBTH that his plans for the venue are still not formalized, but promises \"When I have the cocktail list and menu finalized I will be sure to let you know.\" Is a celeb filled rolodex and ability to get into the gossip magazines enough to make a restaurant work? In our experience, no. We sit on the edge of our seats awaiting this scene to play out.

it's so nice to see you guys getting along !!! awhile back the promoter/man about town vegas was set to do this gig and i was brought in for my 3 cents. the space has major design issues especially with sound and flow. i met with paul(owner) and the brilliant marcel wanders. one of my design idols. who did the joint. i offered solutions but i'm sure they were never fully implemented. i think the lobby is ok the problems arise when you get to the bar area which just can't comfortably sustain a crowd. the transition to the restaurant also is funky and all the energy escapes into the skylight with the exception of the sound which rattles around and returns as a muffled mess
new chef?
2009-04-24 11:11:00
i think this is a great move for hotel rivington, with levine's focus on customer service, and his energy, i think it could be a huge success, is there a new chef?
the og jc
2009-04-24 11:32:00
its about time they brought someone in who can make the venue work. rivington is smack in the middle of the les - no reason why it shouldnt have great food and ambiance.

Colin
2009-04-24 11:39:00
Entirely agree, I think by and large the focus should be on the side bar area and the second floor which are actually enclosed spaces. The bar/resto in the lobby just does not work as a venue.

2009-04-24 11:49:00
\"if you build it, they will come,\" i think you guys are looking too much into the design, and layout, with the right people, right music, right customer service, and right press, and of course, the right food, the place will be a huge success, and i think levine and his team can do that, gotta give the kid a chance - the best restaurants in the city are the most \"celeb\" filled (la esquina, waverly, buddakhan, etc).
Food Food Food
2009-04-24 11:58:00
Restaurants are about food. As clubby as Waverly is, for some reason people enjoy the food there. Don't ask why, personally i think its overrated. Also, Graydon and his partners have enough $$ to make it work, and their customers are older and rich. This guy is no graydon carter, and just getting celebs in there for 6 months isnt enough to make a restaurant last.

Abbe Diaz,All four of those places are so insignificant. Point made, they get a little hype and then what? Eveyone realizes they suck. Look at places that have last with celebrity hype, and are worth going to, love them or hate them. Stanton, Waverly, Bea, La Esquina, Buddakahn, spice market etc.

Hi Abbe, we've never met...I don't think. BUT we do have something in common, we've both been interviewed by Uncle Steve,known him for many years and have been involved in the business in some capacity or another. I don't agree with your definition (and the Supreme Court's) either. I believe \"celebrity\" to mean: anyone who has achieved local or national recognition in their chosen field. IE; YOU are a celebrity in your domain, Uncle Steve is a celeb in his world, and MANY years ago I used to be a celeb in mine! BTW..I enjoyed your interview and love your comments!!

Money Making,yah yah-- but i thought the original point was: \"Is a celeb filled rolodex and ability to get into the gossip magazines ENOUGH to make a restaurant work? In our experience, no.\"all those places you mention have something OTHER than the \"rolodex\" and the \"gossip pages\"-- LaEsquina has uniqueness, novelty, serge-becker, great margaritas, 1000 tequilas, and pretty darned good food... SpiceMarket has a famous chef (TWO originally, actually), jacques-garcia, a good commercial location, impressive square footage, and Starwood cash... theWaverly has eric-goode and sean-macpherson, emil-varda, a knowledgeable/experienced/dedicated staff, and tasty biscuits... etc etc etc.i assert the four i mentioned have ONLY (or not much more than) \"the rolodex\" and the \"gossip pages\"-- and YET, they \"work.\"FASCINATING, isn't it ?

abbe diaz:Look at the top 100 grossing restaurants in NYC and ZERO, NONE, NADA of your aforementioned places that \"work\" are there. But again, in the Nightlife Industry success does not mean making money, its how many Page 6 mentions you can get to validate your existence and will make it a lot easier to swindle some idiot to invest in the newest club that won't pay them one dollar back. I have a better question; name ONE person from nightlife in the last 20 years that has made 1/2 of what pastis or baltazar or EVEN THE FREAKING SHAKE SHACK IN ONE YEAR WITH THEIR STUPID ROLODEX

The dark haired female bartender was the biggest bitch I've encountered in a long time. I asked her what kind of beer they served and she acted like I insulted her first born!

abbe diaz
2009-04-27 09:46:00
oh fuck it, you already got me started goddammit--okay, i think i kinda understand what you're trying to say-- but naming places like Balthazar or Pastis isn't perhaps making your point all that clearly. cuz those places also use their \"rolodex\" and \"gossip pages\" as keys to their success (AS WELL AS their OTHER virtues, which by the way, come from decades of EXPERIENCE).but just as an example-- i remember reading an article about one of my former bosses (a bit of a \"press\" whore himself), and it was making a big fuss and rah rah-ing something about how all his locations combined do \"over 20,000 covers per week.\"(this little tidbit was then subsequently picked up by cityfile, and is listed under his profile.)well-- i just read this and laughed. ya know why ?cuz just off the top pf my head, i can name one restaurateur who does 10,000 covers PER DAY.WITHOUT any \"equity partners\" or venture capital or other outside investment (other than personal/corporate credit extended by banks/creditors).get that ? all created and funded by ONE SELF-MADE MAN (who by the way, also OWNS a good portion of the real estate in which his restaurants are located).i bet you have no idea who i'm talking about.and do you know why ?cuz you've never read his name \"in Page Six.\"so alls i'm sayin is: puhlease. don't go dissin matt-levine with examples like Balthazar/Pastis. that's ridiculous--cuz for alls you know: matt-levine could very well be the keith-mcnally of 2020.

Tonight is the grand opening gala for Eugene Remm and Mark Birnbaum's new lounges, The Chandelier Room and The Living Room, at the W Hoboken. Yeehaw. To commemorate the event, they have lined up a special Live Performance by Jamie Foxx, Music by DJ Cassidy, and a fireworks show beginning at 9:45pm. But is any of that enough to get enough NYC revellers to head through the tunnel for a 7:00 start? We guess that people are willing to try everything once, but going forward, why not just market to the Hoboken and Jersey City crowds that may be looking for some upscale hotel fun? We recommend skipping the trek out there, having a drink at the Rusty Knot and watching the fireworks from the good side of the river.

Another Thursday morning, and another Quick Hits! Bam! The owners of Su Casa are a little steamed that the world's first impression of their Q-Doba linked space was this photo, saying \"The art hasn't been hung on the walls yet, the DJ booth isn't built out, and all of those dining tables are in there!!\" Even though they have been having small get togethers, the space just isn't finished yet. Recession? What recession? We hear that the Surf Lodge is doing gangbusters in reservations for the season, with a Little Birdy telling DBTH, they \"are nearly sold out on over half of the weekends, with only 1 or 2 rooms available on the holiday weekend\". Best book yourself a space now, or you may wind up having to stay in Westhampton. Ay Carumba!

***CONTENT
The Pig 'N' Whistle is a well known, if unremarkable Midtown drinking establishment. But it holds a special place in some people's hearts. For example, there is a fellow who's girlfriend got Biblical with him and then went to the Pig & Whistle and got Biblical with his best friend. That's no good. The fellow turned to Craigslist to put their Biblical glass table up for sale, and got a bit personal. The key sentence includes \"Don't let the glass top fool you. It's 3/8\" thick, can take a pounding and cleans up fast\". Snap. The full post is after the jump, and is well worth it. With those cold depressing days of winter behind us, if you can't frolic through the wildflower fields of Southern California, then what better way welcome the warm weather than sprucing up your boring apartment with a little spring decorating. Hurry now because this original Samantha Haberkorn coffee table won't last long. What? You've never heard of the Samatha Haberkorn collection? Maybe that's because you've never been to a brothel or visited enough public bathroom stalls where you surely would have seen her name etched on the wall. Samantha Haberkorn is my ex-girlfriend and two weeks ago I plowed her on top of this coffee table before she squeezed her fat ass back into her size 12 jeans and went out to the Pig'N Whistle and banged my best friend (who she's now dating). Don't let the glass top fool you. It's 3/8\" thick, can take a pounding and cleans up fast (personally I suggest 409's spermicidal-antibacterial all surface cleaner)[Craigslist].

Listen up Merkato 55 and Bagatelle. Master of the Doucheverse Arthur Kade wants you to know that a brunch party is not a brunch party unless he and posse are on the scene. Arthur says that he enjoyed a 9 hour brunch this weekend, in which the restaurant management seated his party in the \"front section of the block because the staff knows us and wants us visible to the public.\" Kade drank several mimosas (he is a celebrity) and really made it happen. But the day was not without incident, because Kade says \"I had my gym clothes on, so I went to a clothing store and bought a new outfit for the night, changed at Rouge, and when I came out, one of my friends said, 'You look so hot, I think I would do you right now'.\" The outfit change is shown above, but it seems that all of the \"girls\" in Philly share one pair of sunglasses.

From his site:One of my biggest pet peeves is a girl who is not probably groomed on all parts of her body. If you are a hot girl, then it is imperative that everything is shaved, or clean to the point that there is minimal hair. I have had many experiences with beautiful women where they have been amazing looking (especially Internationally), but upon further investigation they are not properly groomed, and I have actually stopped in the middle of the act.

He is one of the few good guys left out there.. hopefully you will be able to get over your jealousy and enjoy the summer, and the sad thing is you will probably be the first person in line to get into the Garden ...

Casbar Sex Club Shut Down

***CONTENT
The Casbar, a sex club in the Gowanus/Sunset Park area that was profiled by the New York Times in February, has been temporarily closed by a Brooklyn judge after three undercover inspectors witnessed more than 150 incidents of prohibited sexual activity. According to a case summary, \"The alleged sex acts violated Sanitary Code §24-2.2, which states, \"No establishment shall make facilities available for the purpose of sexual activities in which ... high risk sexual activity takes place.\" The statute defines 'high risk sexual activity' as anal intercourse and fellatio. Sadly, the closure means that the Casbar had to cancel its planned sex-themed Passover seder run by the social club Kinky Jews. [NY Law Journal] The full summary and link to the case are available after the jump. Citing the testimony of three undercover inspectors who witnessed more than \"150 incidents of prohibited sexual activity,\" a Brooklyn judge has granted a motion for a preliminary injunction temporarily closing Casbar, a Brooklyn sex club. Despite the club's billing as \"New York's newest and cleanest swing club,\" Supreme Court Justice Robert J. Miller held that the proof of the club's repeated violations of the state's Sanitary Code was sufficient to grant relief without considering the standard three-prong test for preliminary injunctions. Even so, Justice Miller wrote, the detectives' testimony would have easily established the test's requirement of \"irreparable injury.\" \"[T]he evidence submitted in the record and at the hearing is sufficient to entitle the City to a preliminary injunction under the more rigorous standard required under CPLR Section 6301,\" Justice Miller wrote in City of New York v. Casbar, 7819/09. \"There is substantial undisputed evidence that the defendants have engaged in illegal activities.\" Casbar, located on the industrial fringes of Sunset Park, Brooklyn, is an \"erotic and dimly lit Fantasyland,\" according to its Web site. The New York City Department of Health initiated an undercover investigation of the club and, on April 1, successfully petitioned for an ex parte closing order. (The closing resulted in the cancellation of a sex-themed Passover seder run by the social club Kinky Jews.) On April 13, Justice Miller held a hearing of the city's request for a preliminary injunction. The Department of Health's investigators testified regarding the 150-plus acts of fellatio and intercourse they had witnessed. The alleged sex acts violated Sanitary Code §24-2.2, which states, \"No establishment shall make facilities available for the purpose of sexual activities in which ... high risk sexual activity takes place.\" The statute defines \"high risk sexual activity\" as anal intercourse and fellatio. The defense offered the testimony of the building's owner and a \"boothman\" who was charged with collecting entry fees. \"Neither witness had personal knowledge of whether the alleged activities occurred in the Casbar,\" Justice Miller wrote. \"As such, the record establishes a continued pattern of violation of law by the defendants which was not disputed by any credible witness.\" The judge granted the city's petition without requiring the city to satisfy the three-pronged test for injunctive relief. In order to obtain a preliminary injunction, a plaintiff usually must demonstrate a likelihood of both success on the merits and irreparable injury absent the injunction, as well as a balancing of the equities favoring the plaintiff. \"It is clear that where, as here, there is repeated illegal activities at an establishment and that such conduct violates a statutory scheme designed to protect the public health, that the conduct constitutes a violation and may be considered a public nuisance subject to the Administrative Code,\" Justice Miller concluded. \"In these circumstances, the City is entitled to injunctive relief since there is a prima facie showing that City laws are being violated.\" Long Island solo practitioner William C. McCulloh represented Casbar. He did not return calls for comment. Stacey Mondschein appeared on behalf of the city's corporation counsel. Gabriel Taussig, the chief of the city's administrative law division, called the case \"part of the ongoing effort to combat HIV by addressing high-risk sexual activities.\"

I'm confused..there are plenty of other on premises sex clubs in NY (Le Trapeze, for one, which has been around forever!!), and people there partake in every kind of \"unsafe\" activity imaginable..clubs like Casbar STRONGLY endorse safe activity, and provide PUBLIC HEALTH NOTICES, and PLENTY OF FREE CONDOMS, and a security staff to enforce these policies. People choose NOT to heed the protections and warnings, and choose to indulge in activities at their own discretion..I'm really confused..how do other sex clubs stay in business while this one is shut down?..Something smells here.

Don't call it a comeback, but according to a Little Birdy, \"Matt Shendell of Paige Management Group has joined forces with China Grill Management to bring the Garden of ONO back to life as premiere happy hour and weekend destination.\" We guess this means that the rumored collaboration between Iron Mike Satsky and China Grill never materialized, and that Chodorow and Shendell will look to fill this place with visitors, tourists and weekend warriors who head over to the MePa looking for some action and can't get into 675 Bar. Good times all around.

Ono is nice spot with overpriced drinks and terrible service. Matt may own DUNE but, Noah is the BOSS. This ain't gonna be a Noah spot. Put your ear to the ground DBTH. Maybe look into who is going to be involved in Hudson Terrace. Sounds to me like that is going to be the spot for the summer.
LOL
2009-04-24 23:10:00
Please don't tell me that the losers from Hudson terrace are going to start shilling on here also. If i want to see nonsense about any of there spaces just go to city search. PLEASE don't let them clog up Evey sight with FAKE reviews and announcements about how great all there spaces are. What would be great would be to to hear from any of the 9,450 investors that all believe they own 20% of there spaces. lol that would be interesting. I swear Im waiting to find out Bernie Madoff is one of the partners!

Shake Shack and Howard Schultz = Domination

***CONTENT
In the last 12 months, Shake Shack has expanded beyond its popular Madison Square Park original, opening a larger outpost on the Upper West Side, followed by a wildly popular Citi Field location. The small scale expansion has proved that the Shack model is scalable, so the question is what should be done with it? While rumors of Chicago and Tokyo has been floated, we have heard that Meyer and his Union Square Hospitality Group have much bigger plans. And according to a Little Birdy, Meyer and his team have lined up a sponsor with a proven track record at a national and global expansion. Our Little Birdy tells us: I was just walking down the street near the UWS Shake Shack next to a Shack employee walking to work and talking on his cellphone. He was telling whoever he was talking to that they are seriously entertaining discussions with Howard Schultz to be the main bankroller for a large scale expansion. He said Danny Meyer has spent a lot of time with him lately and that Schultz has been in the shop a bunch of times checking it out. An operator only has a certain window to strike big, and with rumors of competitors trying to replicate the concept, Meyer has to move before every US city has it's own Shack. Here comes Schultz to help provide the financing and know how in growing a small, local business into a behemoth. Wherever this is headed, it's sure to be juicy.

Everyone and their mother will be converging upon Palm Desert this weekend for Coachella. But while most of the action will be happening on the polo field, the folks at the Ace Hotel are throwing a little celebratory bash of their own, letting everyone know about the brand new Ace Hotel Palm Springs. To take it up a notch, the Ace folks are going to be serving up boozy sno cones all weekend long. Delicious and refreshing! Unfortunately, the Ace bash is invite only, so don't go thinking that a festival ticket will get you in.

Timmy Regisford is running an after hours party at Greenhouse, which used to be the location of the Shelter party, which has been a after hours party running for 20 years (YES, the party has been going for 20 years, just in different locations). Shelter used to be in the space down on Hubert and Hudson, later known as Vinyl, and Arc, before it was demolished to make way for condos.So if the answer to this question is Greenhouse, then you guys are a few years late (since they moved to Varick anyhow).The real Shelter party moved to Webster Hall on Saturday night into Sunday mornings. Just because most of the clubs spoken about on this site relate to bottle service and alcohol, doesn't mean that a club has to close at 4.Click the link below for the flyer for Timmy's party which starts this Sunday.http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3557/3409904158_2013ca2d57_b.jpg

Do you have $250,000 laying around? Do you want to open a nightclub? Why risk opening your own when you buy yourself an established brand with a nice global presence? Here's a chance to make the most of your dreams by opening a Pink Elephant with a sweet licensing agreement. All it takes is the before mentioned $250,000, a 3 year lease (with renewal options) and a willingness to send PE 4% of the annual gross. It's win, win, win! Excuse us while we go talk to Goldman about an IPO in DBTH to raise the cheddars to get this done. Pink Elephant Group Marketing Deck [PDF]

@MDC I agree in general, but you picked the WORST example. Pacha NYC is such an embarrassment, they (pacha) have threatened twice to pull the franchise. Pacha Ibiza (not the original btw) is a paradise, this place here is a shithole! In general though, licensing is a great way to build a worldwide brand. Problem is most club owners don't have the business wherewithall to do it properly, especially picking locations (e.g. Home in St Louis? Pink in Puerto Vallarta? )

Pacha was never predicated on exclusivity - rather it was great music and DJ's that drove the crowds. Pink is an entirely different animal in those terms. It is not easy to maintain the sense of luxury and exclusivity whilst effectively franchising something out.
MDC
2009-04-16 13:45:00
@ NYCOracle: I hear you, that's why I said \"most cities\". I understand it's pretty sh*tty here in NYC, but that's as much a function of the unfortunate reality that no one can seem to fill a big space without it being invaded by the riff-raff that surrounds this glorious little place known as Manhattan/Brooklyn. And Pacha Ibiza is indeed a paradise. David Guetta's F*CK Me I'm Famous parties... nothing short of amazing.
MDC
2009-04-16 13:48:00
@ Colin: Definitely not easy, but you have to think that it's possible. Just as select restaurants are exclusive with who (and maybe more importantly, where) they award a franchise too, you'd think the owners of Pink will do the same thing. I could see 4, maybe 5, Pink's being able to co-exist in the states, all while maintaining its originally intended aura. Who knows though, people aren't that smart.

Bar Martignetti Switch Up Denied!

DBTH
***DATE
2009-04-15 08:37:00
***CONTENT
The planned switchover from Bar Martignetti seems to have been a bait and switch tactic by the Brothers Martignetti, as they attempted to split their liquor license in half and give the upstairs half to Burak Karacam, managing partner of Pera. The Cafe Noir team who were lined up to take over the restaurant were nowhere to be found. Of course, no downtown Community Board would ever go for something like this, so they delivered the proverbial back of the hand to this scheme, rejecting this plan outright. Shock, but we can't say we blame them. A plan like this requires an owner to spend months working the CB members, so that when it's meeting time, you aren't leaving anything to chance. A nice picture helps too. Our friends at Boozy NYC wasted an entire night listening to this drivel, and have a full report. Until they get this figured out, there is always Southside to soothe your soul.

See Ya: Mark Baker Leaves M2
***AUTHOR
DBTH
***DATE
2009-04-14 12:56:00
***CONTENT
Three months after hatching the M2 plan to salvage the train wreck disaster that was Mansion, Mark Baker has left the building. It seems that the \"nightlife hero\" couldn't it make it work with low level promoter Joey Morrisey, so he is off to Moscow to produce some large scale events. Baker then plans on lending his superstar skills to one of the Hamptons clubs this summer, and then will team up on a new project with Jon B. and Barry \"the Shark\" Mullineaux, who are running the notorious stink box that is Greenhouse. So while M2 presses forward, we can all admit that it is one of the loudest and most expensive nightlife failures this city has seen for quite some time. The crowds never turned up, even during its brash opening complete with its original Miami team and before the city's economy really tanked. People were still buying (and selling) bottles, just not at Mansion. The plans to turn the place around with the tired Ministry of Sound and theme nights flopper royally, and Baker has left it in the hands of C/D list promoters to try and salvage whatever is left. With real estate development all but dead, the value of property in West Chelsea is greatly diminished. This club space is basically worthless until the next turnaround, and there is no telling when that will be. The end. [GNML]

I can say that I know for a fact that M2/Mansion PACKS the place every single weekend it's insanely ridiculous the things you write about this club, where does your hate stem from? I just don't get it. I think instead of just ripping off EVERY other blog and combining it into one blog you should do your research from now on, they've had great press recently and some really VIP guests coming, not paid to come, but actually just going there to party. I love reading your blog and hearing about funny happenings but this is disappointing that with a good story like this you flopped and resorted to hatred. I'm so sorry to see your standards so low.I think we should all be excited to see what Mark is planning on bringing us next, I know I am.

Hi DBTH Mark Baker here.I always just try to refrain from commenting on \"opinions\" as thankfully this is a free country and everyone is entitled to one and whilst whatever you think about the history of this particular venue and the Miami Group and even my participation I think your comments are a little harsh and definitely not entirely correct. M2 is doing very good business right now, pays it's bills, employs a whole bunch of New Yorkers and believe it or not is a really good time for 1,000's of people every week. Anyone or organization who attempts to create something fun in this environment should be applauded not kicked in the teeth. Give everyone a break and please try to stick to the positive aspects of nightlife not just the negative I have respect for you and your column but your comments have potential negative effects on many people who are employed in the nightlife business, and that's just not cool when right now they have a job and with Joey and Artie's experience and energy will continue to have jobs in the future. There's way too much negativity out there we should be directing the criticism and anger at aggressive city agencies that are hell bent on closing venues not keeping them open. Yours Sincerely,Mark Baker

the dbth editor is a lonely and miserable person who continues to remain anonymous to his readers.well, he is a residential real estate agent and his name is scott solish. he has never tried any venture remotely close to running a club, especially one of the size and scope of mansion. when it first came to new york, it was a smash and theres no ifs ands or buts about that. unfortunately, with rent prices sky high and bottle demand down, theres not much you can do for the bottom line. scott solish has never written a positive comment about any venue. ever. no one in manhattan likes or respects him.

mark, you are definitely one of the great scumbags in nyc nightlife. welcome to dbth comments!!! i am personally pleased to see the bullshit promotional garbage that you, steve lewis, et al were spewing has been proven false. m2 providing jobs and all is a nice guilt trip for those talking shit, but just be honest about what happened. when you go out and comment to the press the way that you and steve did, then you can't complain about being called out yourself. i mean, you and steve both lost a tremendous amount of credibility on this project- as a partner and as a media personality. blame the economy if you want, but we know other clubs are killing it. you guys just blew it with a bad concept. in fact you got it all wrong- crowd, concept, timing.bottom line, opium can't kill in nyc. miami is so different and cheesy. mansion never would have worked in nyc. the concept was years behind the curve. so was ministry.you guys are old and out of touch. somebody's got to call your asses out and point out your failures. dbth has opinions and he expresses them freely. more often than not, he is right. and, more often than not, steve is wrong. somebody has to cut through the promo bullshit that you guys espouse. maybe if there were some quality nightlife people in nyc, most of the news wouldn't be negative.

hahaha, oh cameron, you're pathetic....Scott came out as the editor a year ago, read NY Mag once in a while....in addition, he rights positive reviews all the time, as opposed to schilling for surf lodge...mansion was far from a raging succes outside the B&T crowd, which doesnt say much.I know everyone in this city, including mark, and I like scott........so enough dude.Attack him for being a real estate agent once more and i come snip your inbred balls.

Mansion is and always has been a club for a mass promoter crowd. No image promoter ever worked this party with the idea that it would actually work.

are you guys blind? the only positive things DBTH has said are things about Beatrice Inn and a few other little venues, well GUESS WHAT guess you were wrong too.but maybe we should all face the facts that this is a hard time for nightlife, clubs are closing left and right and it's not fair to attack one and save another, as people in nightlife we're all in this together, we're all new yorkers, and we all need to start acting like it.M2 does get a lot of B&T, but that's what happens when you make a big name for yourself, people from outside of the island find out. It's still making more money.

Stua, you are happy to see promotional garbage Mark and Steve Lewis are spreading? JUST SO YOU KNOW DBTH just straight rips his stories off of goodnight mr lewis. Wouldn't it be exciting if DBTH would say something different about this story OR ANY STORY than what other blogs have already written?Stop fronting, Mark Baker is a legend AND still remains to be one of the only gentlemen in this business.

stua, Anyone with half a brain can read between the lines of your commentary to see that your shit talking stems from one of two things: your self-loathing or your jealousy of Mark. Maybe if you got laid once in a while you wouldn’t be so bitter towards those who do.
the true story
2009-04-14 16:00:00
Listen... Let me correct all of you on this......New York Nightlife is a complete different breed then any other scene in the country. The idea of bringing a mega club to New York that had a mixed format was a good idea thinking the bottle spenders, the arab princes, the euro $ and the left over wall street money would and pop bottles. Obviously with the stock market pretty much going to shit after the summer of 08', ALOT changed in nightlife.What people dont realize, is that after your cost of goods, your fixed costs and your staff/promoters, theres not much left for profit (if any at all)There is going to be a drastic change in nightlife with in the next 6-8 months. Places that think that they are gonna make it through the summer and then hoping the economy will pick in the fall, are crazy. Steven Kamali and Alex Pickens are going to be filled with listings come Fall 09 because most places will wither go belly up because they wont be able to pay their rent. The small places ala gold bar, kingswood, southside, the eldridge, those are the rooms that will survive and that will be the new trend. I also think that the new places are setting to open as so called \"hybrids\" are going to be successful aswell because there wont be many payouts to promoters.Look at the promoters that were once working at Citrine,Tenjune, and places to that sort that were making $1000 a night or so are getting that money anymore. DJs like Berrie, MOS, Cassidy,etc who used to get $900+ to spin are not getting that all in the city .....NYC nightlife is about to change big time.... good luck to the big clubs. Here comes the little guys, Brother Jimmys, Southern Hospitality and places like that.

i definitely owned up to the fact that mansion didn't get where it could have. there are a thousand reasons why that happened . the economy is certainly part of it. however mansions lack of success as defined by you cannot be laid at mark bakers door, at least not too much. he gave it a try but was handcuffed by conflicting visions, mostly out of miami and an unwillingness of the opium group to adjust to market realities. dbth and my column often cover the same story often from different angles. although scott has never run a club i enjoy his insight and am a loyal reader.i dont feel i am in competition with other blogs and i get along quite well with scott whenever we do meet. although writing for bb is rewarding it is certainly not my full time gig .design is. i will say this, i have operated some pretty good places and mark baker has worked for me , better, with me a few times. in the pressured world of nightlife arguments are bound to happen and mark and i have indeed thrown down. yet never have i seen him be anything but a gentleman, he always remains calm and polite and he has inspired me with his dedication and honesty. indeed to call him names is ridiculous as he has always endeavored to make sure that his employees are paid, paid well and on time and that they were always respected. in a business where owners see themselves as gods he is always a fair hand. i also think greenhouse is ok.. its not beatrice or even southside but their sunday suzanne bartsch , kenny kenny party is the best night in town for many. mondays are really fun and i enjoy wednesdays a great deal. indeed if you want to punch me in the nose or throw eggs at me or even talk to me face to face i'll be djing there tomorrow night.

Not only does 2009 mark the end of overpriced shitty \"exclusive\" clubs in New York... I think we're all sick of the whole public relations game as well. Everything's marketed and packaged and glasses of piss and plates of shit are sold to us for hundreds of dollars because marketing tells us to do so. And when clubs fail, the public relations guys clean up the mess. I think it's time for New York to have something REAL, not 300 clubs that are image-driven or marketed well for 2 months and then that's it.Bring a simple legit venue with good music and the people will come.

Scott is not a residential real estate agent. Each comment asserting he is lacks credibility.
For Real
2009-04-15 12:25:00
I know Mark Baker as a person and a businessman. He is as Kind of a guy as there is in this shitty business. Mansion was not a success but, no where near the failure that most of you claim it to be. As I have said before in my comments, not everyone in this city wants to be at Beatrice, 1Oak or something along those lines. In fact most of the people who go to those places are in the minority. Mark is a legend in this business. That is a fact. On top of whatever plans he has with Jon B. etc, he is also set to reopen Double Seven this summer.Uncle Steve was wrong on this. He for sure doesnt like to admit he is wrong but, he did. Steve is a personality that many love and many don't love. However, he again is a legend in this business. He might not always be right (even though he thinks he is) but, he is right more often then almost anyone else.All of you who comment should always remember that there is a person not only a name. when you start calling people you do not know scumbags, etc. it's just not cool. Mansion was not a success. Steve was wrong. That doesn't make Mark or Steve bad guys.

thank you ,for real, the one thing about my early mansion thumbs up that i think i got right is that clubland is getting really good. although i don't think there are any clubs that i consider great there are great parties or nights happening . i hardly ever went into mansion although i did visit my friends at the door constantly. the crowd was a decent crowd for quite awhile but the scenes resurgence was due to the efforts of many others. the best night there was the paper magazine awards party where scott picked up the best nightlife blog award. somebody said i was way up scotts ass and i dont even know what that means, another said that scott gets a lot of his info off my column. there has never been an instance where scott reported something that i got first where he didnt give me proper credit. i have said many times that i read this blog daily as i find it very informative. i totally respect it. i think we write from different angles most of the time. there is no competition between us. scott and rachelle at goag and myself and many others turn out a great deal of content with little financial reward. most of the time we get it right sometimes were wrong. mansion wasnt close to my standard of greatness but over the last year and change i got a lot of other things right...good luck to mark baker and to joey morrissey, artie and the m2 crew

Q: How do you know that the nightclub you own is irrelevant? A: It gets shut down and hardly anyone notices. A prime example is The Plumm, which has been closed for \"legal problems\" for several days and no one noticed except for this site. Hell, we wouldn't have even noticed if not for a Little Birdy that sent it our way. Not good news for Noel Ashman, who has big dreams but little business traction. We guess that downstairs expansion didn't take off like planned. [Photo Credit]

@saying, you're retarded and you don't even know. Stop making up stories about affairs you have no clue about.Noel drained everyone he was involved with at the plumm (minus his 2 celebrity investors) Tom pretty much got financially-anally-raped because he cared and trusted Noel. And is still stuck there on that sinking ship in hopes that by some miracle, he might make his hard-earned money back. The plumm stopped paying out their waitresses and bartenders credit card tips a year before the \"recession\" .I'm hoping that all you promoters out there that are still owed money by that dinosaur skulled imbecile, bring it back old school and get midevil on his ass. Oh wait, that's right, promoters are skinny dicked faggots who bark loud, and put on an over-exaggerated front as IF they were tough. Nevermind

I had hoped that Plumm would work but it never did. In all the time it was open it never made money it was only kept open by Noel Mother's personal checkbook. Noel has no business sense and has long since lost his ability to promote a club. Never believe what you read on page six it is all paid for.There is a long line of creditors apart from the landlord. He never filed company taxes, did not pay his sales tax bills or multiple other vendors. It was only a matter of who would close it down first, the landlord or the tax man.I am sorry for the Bus boys, Bartenders etc who lost money on this but don't think for a minute that any of those Celebrities he was fond of quoting lost any money. They never had any stake in the game. Most of the investment came from Wall street types.

It's not just Bar Martignetti appearing on the Community Board 2 calendar tomorrow night. Our old friends at the Mondrian NYC who are applying for a liquor license at tonight's meeting. While it's well known that Sam Talbot is working on the restaurant space (seafood heavy with a nod to Chinatown), the hotel lounge hasn't gotten much play lately. A hotel rep tell us, \"We're still working on final lounge / bar concepts, but know that we'll have a boutique beverage program with great mixologists, handcrafted cocktails, quality product and longevity!\" We're admire your pep, and hope that travellers and NYCers will still want to head down Lafayette on a consistent basis.

Just when we were ready to bury the cocktail movement, someone comes along to potentially breathe life back into the scene. According to our friends at Eater, David Chang is in the process of reconfiguring Momofuke Ssam to install a cocktail bar in the front section. As for the drinks, \"PDT's Don Lee is indeed in charge of the cocktail program and that he should be ready with a menu in the next week or so.\" We have no doubt that the introductory price will be in the $15 a pop range, which we hate, but we are expecting some boundary pushing combos. Eyes open.

Calling all bartenders and mixologists, there is finally a reality TV competition for you. Here goes: The Fine Living Network is now casting bartenders in the New York/Tri-State area to feature on a new FLN series \"Bartender Wars\". Bartenders will go head-to-head with each other and frequently enlist their patrons in a variety of bartending challenges, from the simple to the outlandish. Full details can be found here. If you'll excuse us, we have to go set our DVR's to Keep Forever.

Bar Martignetti has been closed for renovations for several months now, as the brother's Martignetti planned to do two weeks of \"significant renovations\" and create a more food-focused restaurant. But have those plans been put aside? According to one Little Birdy, the answer is a yes. According to a Little Birdy, \"On the community board 2 calendar of meetings and applications it says cafe noir is moving to 406 broome aka closed for \"renovations\" bar martignetti. lawyer in my neighborhood who is very active on the community board (live near police building) confirmed this application has been sent and is processing. anthony martignetti's restaurateur dream was short lived...but southside is fun.\" Indeed, the Board's calendar does have two items for Bar Martignetti and Cafe Noir, a transfer and license alteration application. Vallat, Inc. d/b/a Cafe Noir, 199 Lafayette St./406 Broome St., NYC 10012 (1stfloor) Vallat, Inc. d/b/a Cafe Noir, 32 Grand St., NYC 10013-(relocation see app. above) With the behind the scenes manoeuvring, it looks like this one could be a done deal. The meeting is tomorrow night, so stay tuned.

***CONTENT
The much discussed Save the Beatrice affair did indeed take place Friday night in the penthouse of the Cooper Square Hotel. The Beatrice Inn staff spread the word Friday afternoon to regular patrons to come by the glassy box tower on the Bowery for some old school Beatrice fun, albeit in a much more modern space - complete with a wrap-around balcony and amazing views. Here's how one Little Birdy summed it up: It was the usual debauchery with the penthouse taken over. There was free drinks at the bar an in he bathtub. people were peeing in the showers and dancing on the wrap around terrace. It was really fun. Angelo and Todd only let in people they knew. Lots of people got turned away, even people who go to the Beatrice all the time. Even people who were meeting friends got turned away. It was really strange who got in and who didn't. I don't know what the door policy was, but once you got in it was free drinks all around with lots of Belvedere IX to go around. Don't forget the Save the Beatrice t-shirts and buttons, as well as a super soaker full of either Jack or Don Julio acting as a mobile shot station which we passed on. What can we say? Anyway, guests included one of the Olsen girls, Chloe Sevigny, some skinny guys with moustaches, and KP. Yeah you know me. Rumor has it that the Bea should be back up and running by the end of the month at the latest, with a good chance it could happen by next week. Exhale.

A Canadian shucker commenting on his 5 months in New York as he helped open Flex Mussels: In Canada, everything is measured very precisely. It's one ounces or two ounces. In New York, we were pouring three-ounce, four-ounce cocktails, and women would just look at it and say, 'That's disgusting. That's not a drink.' \"I had to pour a five-ounce martini for (one woman who complained). Do people know what they're drinking? They're drinking a fifth of a bottle of vodka with each drink.\" Speaking of definitions - a Canuck alluding to Americans as drunks. That is the definition of irony. [NYT]

Has the craptastic, bacchanalian brunch party at Merkato 55 shifted from a weekly event to an annual one? GoaG says \"The Koch brothers are back from their trip to Miami and their annual brunch party welcomed them back in full force.\" We could only be so lucky. It's more likely that the party's hired mouthpiece didn't know that annual means once a year, not once a week. Expect there to be a large crowd of glitter monkeys lined up tomorrow afternoon for bad food, house music, and being sprayed by cheap Rose. Arms Up! [Photo Credit]

Grub Street finally revealed the location of the latest (and not yet licensed) cocktail bar, Su Casa, located above a Q Doba on Sixth Avenue. Funny enough, because DBTH actually told you about it first. Somehow, brick walls, flat screen tv's and metal tables doesn't really exude \" a rustic old-world Mexican feel... Think Upstairs, designed by Frida Kahlo.\" The best part about this hot mess is the Grubber's insertion of the phrase \"cock-tease\", defined here as \"that's when a blog or a daily newsletter coyly keeps you guessing about how to get your hands on a cocktail.\" Uh, right. While it may be part of the vernacular for those high-fellutin' editors at New York, don't expect to see your old friend DBTH use it again. [Photo Credit]

Lately, we have been thinking a lot about the speakeasy scene in New York City. Each week, another blog announces yet another opening of a speakeasy, which seeks to harken back to those glory years when Prohibition was the rule and drinking was done behind unmarked doors. But those days are long gone. You can get a drink anywhere you damn please damn near any time of day. Despite this libation freedom, every basement and crawl space available is being turned into a dimly lit, small table having, jazz playing cocktail den, serving up $14 variations of the drinks of yesteryear. Frankly, we are pretty tired of it. But we wanted to ask what you thought. What do you think about the ongoing Speakeasy Trend in New York City? ( online surveys)

The last great speakeasy burned down a few years ago it was Chumleys, and it actually was a speakeasy because was around during the prohibition and served alcohol illegally (That is how you define a speakeasy). Bars in basements aren't speakeasies because they aren't doing anything illegal, they are simply bars with poor lighting looking for something to make themselves sound more cool.

Breaking news, as the Harlem office of the NY State Liquor Authority was raided this morning as part of an ongoing corruption investigation. According to First Deputy General Kelly Donovan, \"We believe employees are fast-tracking liquor licenses in exchange for gratuities, at the expense of legitimate applicants.\" That's no good. It seems that those who offered cash to the office employees were able to receive a license in as few as 11 days, while those who did not offer a bribe were forced to wait up to 8 months. The investigation is ongoing, but reinforces how problematic the operations of the SLA are. Perhaps it's time to shut the whole thing down and start over again. [WCBS 880]

Ugh, another secret basemdent speakeasy in the East Village. This one is so secret that Grub Street won't even tell you where it is, only that it is in a back room off of a non-descript fast food joint. According to GS: You walk into a downtown burrito joint. On the surface, it looks like any other guac-slinging operation. But to your left is a mysterious flight of stairs. Head up them and open the unmarked door that seems to be only for employees, and you'll be inside a low-ceilinged room awash in a sexy blue hue. There are U-booths in the back, à la PDT or Milk & Honey. Toward the front, two-tops across from a marble bar. The official word is that the hidden spot has yet to snag a liquor license, but, ahem, we were up there last night, weren't we? We guess they were up there, but it doesn't mean they have to rub it in our faces. When we asked for the location so ourselves could check it out, editor Daniel Maurer refused, saying \"I'll reveal the locay soon enough, but want to see if anyone else can sniff it out.\" Where's the love? As for a guess, you know it ain't Chipotle. We are guessing Pinche on Lafayette, even though we aren't sure it has a second floor. It just works.

Save the Scariest Bar in Brooklyn!

***CONTENT
The Local checks out the Navy Yard Cocktail Lounge in the Ft. Greene section of Brooklyn, sometimes referred to as \"the scariest bar in Brooklyn\". Oooooh. The bar, which is hemmed in by the Navy Yard and the BQE, has had a colorful history, including a reputation for being a whorehouse. But according to owner Steve Frankel, that reputation is no longer deserved. According to the Local: Mr. Frankel acknowledges that he has been arrested for \"backroom action,\" he claims that the Cocktail Lounge has long been cleaned up, and that the bar's reputation as a den of sin is wildly exaggerated. Of course it is Mr. Frankel. Anyway, the building that houses the Cocktail Lounge is for sale, with rumors of a boutique hotel (what else?) being the preferred use. Our money says the NYCL will be there for quite some time. [Photo Credit]

Southwest has finally managed to crack the New York City aviation market, securing multiple takeoff and landing slots at LaGuardia airport. The budget airline managed to secure the slots after paying $7.5 million in failed airline ATA's bankruptcy proceedings. New Yorker's will now be able to purchase cheap seats to Austin, LA and Chicago, and hopefully will force the other carriers servicing NYC to lower their costs to compete. Service begins in late June, but seats are on sale now. [Via NYT]

Cameron - sorry that your lawyer screwed up and got you worthless facebook stock rather than cold hard cash. It should be fun suing them to try and recoup what was your one chance to get money that wasn't your parents. It's going to be tough to pay for the photo rights to Patrick McMullan's site and to pay for a share house for too much longer, but you had a good run.

@SS - What is there to know?! There are 4 places in the Hamptons, 6 if you want to be nice. It's not rocket science; although you may want to try and look at it in a business point persepertive, it's nightlife the industry. Nothing more, nothing less. The rest of the world (even NY) need not be affected if PE isnt around. Don't be a hater; there's plenty of retards going around spending money (and yes, that does include me).

Last night, we had the pleasure of attending the Time Out New York Eat Out Awards for 2008 at (le) Poisson Rouge on Bleeker. Like most of these events (which we have some experience with!), the mood was light and festive, and the drinks were flowing. We settled into our seat in press row with some friends to watch most of the ceremony, and while others will run through the food awards, the bar awards (that we remember) are: Best Beer Bar - Beer Table Best Cocktail - Clover Club Best New Bar - The Rusty Knot There may have been more, but it's not important. What is important is that we saw some old friends, met a few new ones, and had a great time toasting the chefs and proprietors that keep us well fed and drunk. Onward!

More information continues to leak out following last week's closure of the Beatrice Inn, so here goes. The Observer's Daily Transom discovers the DOB complaint, showing the Bea was 38 people over capacity at the time of the raid, had an illegal PA system PA Violations, and lacked adequate egress in case of an emergency. The DT also discovers that Beatrice owes some $23,000 in fines due to various stop work order complaints. Finally, a commenter writes: \"I was across the street for a very late lunch around 5 and watched police breaking down the door. They said it was being seized and would not reopen as the Beatrice Inn.\" All of this adds up to not being very good news. While some on the Beatrice staff thought they could reopen this week after settling some of these various issues, it seems as if the authorities are dead set against shutting it down for good. Sigh. We await the final verdict.

Eldridge is lame...
2009-04-06 20:28:00
The Eldridge is a joke. It can't compare to Beatrice or Southside in any way. If the rent for the Eldridge space was any higher than the 4 grand a month or whatever obscenely low number it is, they'd be closing their doors any day now. Unfortunately, Matt still sells enough $16 beers to pay the rent and his staff of \"professionals\" and \"specialists\" or whatever he calls them... For now at least. Although, someone could probably pay their bills having a day job at Duane Reade.

there is no reason to believe bea will not be back. 38 people over capacity is a selective prosecution . every club in town would be violated and shuttered if that strict a capacity was adhered to. how can u mention any of these places in the same breathe.. omg bea is better! ....but not tonight

i don't know that it is 'selective prosecution' if there are 29 outstanding building department violations, several blown court dates, fines owed to the city...

2009-04-07 08:56:00
omg your right that those must be cleared up although they are of such a minor and harassing sort. many clubs are carrying similar burdens and are in various stages of dispute. my comment was that the 38 person over capacity enforcement is like saying places like webster hall will now only have like 1500 people at any time in there as that's @ their capacity. it's an unheard of violation...

Wait, I thought the stop work orders and Department of Building complaints were at Smith and Mill not the Bea! Did these guys file suit against that girl at Smith and Mills because she could have or should have made these complaints rather then having made any claims to anyone. Pretty sure there were no complaints because she and Carlos repaired and paid for the damage themselves costing them 10 times more then these guys owe the city. Wow, maybe this finally explains what they were hiding. She is very hip and very cool. Pretty sure she didn't care what they were doing at Smith and Mills. Maybe these guys were just guilty of the same issues in both places and had no money to fix it. Kevin was never paid for painting Beatrice. He practically lost his apartment too. This isn't cool-

Matt knows a lot of people, it doesn't surprise me the big names they get there... And as he says \"our size allows us to be that exclusive\".I don't go to eldridge that often but when I do go it's always a good time, and crowd. Although I feel like the party always ends too early and I leave because the place empties out, but from 12:30 to 2:30 its packed every night.

The rumors we heard yesterday turned out to be true. Our favorite little dancing den, the Beatrice Inn, has once again been shut down. A Little Birdy writes, \"why is beatrice closed? gate up lights out closed. it's friday night.\" We can only assume it is related to some crackdown by DOH or FDNY (smoking related), but have emailed management for an update. We will certainly keep you posted.

When u ignore multiple building violations, smoke cigarettes in your establishment and have 15 yr old model's sniffing in the bathroom its only a matter of time bf the NYPD is going to have a beef. The very experienced owners of the Beatrice all know this and shouldn't of been too surprised when task force rolled on them.

While enjoying ourselves at the Curbed/EDGE soiree last night, a Little Birdy whispered to us that the Box is in cost cutting mode, forcing its performers and freelance staff to take paycuts in what were not huge salaries to begin with. The Box still draws a crowd, albeit not the same $900 bottle crowd from its opening, and is still attracting top notch events, such as the opening party for Topshop last night. But we can't help but think that the little supper club may not be long for this city.

Well this explains a lot...as I stood outside of the Box last night I watched each group enlist their fearless leader to negotiate with the Box Lord and justify why they be let in to what was clearly shaping up to be the \"lost and found\" of humans aka the Box. The only seemingly common thread of each party being let into the Box was they were, well, going to the Box. Throngs of old people with glasses and not cool, edgy glasses...more like dad glasses were ushered in only to be followed by a group of all guys that looked like their wardrobe was compliments of GAP circa 1996. I swear, I think I saw stonewashed, tapered jeans. Then I observed a group of pin thin, hot, model types get shunned for not having any \"connections.\" WTF? So I politely asked the bouncer what was going on around here and completely picking up what I was throwing down he said, \"I've worked here for 3 years and I still don't know.\" Cash is king y'all even if it's in a frumpy outfit.

The daily news sure does contain a lot of doom and gloom, so we were pleased to receive a pleasant report from a Little Birdy, who says: so i did a lil celebrating for my birthday on a wed night w a dinner party at la esquina at 10pm. place was amazingly packed and busy for this economic climate. Bar was 3-4 deep and moving. Great looking crowd. Took the party then to Goldbar which was quite busy for a wed nite too. Both places seem to be surviving quite well in the current climate. It was like nyc never missed a beat. We know a thing or two about celebrating at La Esquina and Goldbar, and have noticed the same thing. Quality places that made good real estate deals and can manage costs will make it through. It doesn't mean that their revenue and profit hasn't been hurt, but they will make it through. What other places have you noticed to be recession proof? Let's hear it!

i just got back from miami where places like Mynt, Set, Liv had bottles of jouet and dom flowing like water. and not just a table here and there, im talking completely packed house with every $2500-5000 min table sold. it almost looked stupid...cant really speak on new york though. things have seemed pretty quiet to me...

word up: Miami was hopping from the music conference...standard convention season, no?The Box has had nowhere near the good-looking ladies and vibes and crowds that Goldbar and 1Oak have had, it's Gold and Oak if you ask me (and maybe Scumside, a.k.a Mousehouse, a.k.a Cheeseville, a.k.a Bellas) ...everything else has been so-so....Oak tuesdays and Gold sun/wends parties are the only weekly parties worth checking which are still running strong...kicking it live.

Which means they have to book an event for a crowd, I never said the Box folks weren't tight w the PR japs in the fashion industry, but we'll see how \"recession proof\" their corporate event business model is, I'd have to imagine the volume of those have declined dramatically, in fact, before topshop I can't remember anyone that was willing to rent the place out for $100,000.

I personally flock to Miami every other weekend during season (Dec. - Apr.) and I can surely attest it's been very busy. The tables at LIv, Set and Mynt are always sold out.at night and during the day you'll see the cabanas booked at The Gansevoort rooftop. Miami is known to be a great escape during the ruff winter season, and although i'm sure they didn't see as many snow birds shopping and brunching, there is/was still money to be made. As for NY; everything is lame. During the week especially. Unless you have a speical event booked at a place, i think 1oak is the only club in the city that is ridiculously packed with a good looking crowd on Saturdays. Keep in mind, youll still see empty tables at 1:30am. NY is my home and I love it hear, but it's def not what it used to be. In the interim, I hope one day, soon, it will all come back. I heart NY.

people in nyc are tired of the lameness and sameness. give us something relatively cheap, imaginative and fun, and we will go. give us the same faux exclusivity and manufactured hotness and we will spend our cash in other ways. goldbar and 1oak? who cares! those are too-expensive places for paid pseudo-celebs and the snots who want to feel elite by being near them. if you're not into that, it's not a fun time. same thing goes for hip-hop clubs. the hyperbole used to promote them is the only interesting part . . .they are all the same, with the same rotating DJs and the same gunslinger promoters packing in whatever low-rent bodies they can stuff in the door.if i hear one more preening promoter utter the phrase \"super sexy crowd\" i WILL vomit. and no, i'm afraid miami is NOT more fun.

Both the Federal and New York State budgets are in obvious disarray, forcing politicians to look for easy ways to try and raise money. Unfortunately, this round of new taxes and fees will directly hit y'all right where it hurts. The wallet (duh). What are they? 58% increase in the wine tax (NYS) 27% increase in the beer tax (NYS) $.50 additional taxi surcharge (NYS) $.39 per pack additional cigarette tax (Federal) Add it all up, and if you enjoy an adult beverage or two at home, a restaurant or bar, step outside to enjoy some smooth Carolina smoke, and then jump into a taxi because you don't feel like waiting for the subway to come late at night, then the Man is taking some additional coinage from your pocket. Major bummer. And since the Upstate pols are unwilling to put tolls on the bridges or get creative with revenue generating ideas, there isn't much that can be done about it. Except maybe revolt. At least the lap dance tax went away.

Here's a novel idea: How about we actually CUT spending for once? Or do we really need all that warfare, corporate subsidies, and welfare?
precisely
2009-04-03 17:48:00
First of all, the way to increase the tax base is NOT by raising tax rates...no people (brace yourselves), you increase tax revenues for the government by CUTTING taxes. Having a lower tax on income gives people more of an incentive to work harder, longer, and smarter, and having a lower tax on dividends and capital gains gives people (and companies) more of a reason to invest, whether in investment products for themselves, or capital for their businesses. Paying fewer taxes on an investment increases the rate of the return, making the prospect of investing more attractive.This has happened time and again throughout the annals of history...(refer to the performance of the S&P during the administrations of Coolidge, Kennedy, Reagan, and Bush...all of whom destroyed a severe economic malaise by cutting taxes). The outcome is that even at a lower rate, the incentive to produce more is so great, that the taxes collected by the government actually increase. Additionally, lower taxes give people and companies less of a reason to seek out tax avoidance schemes (whether licit or illicit), so again, the Treasury ends up with more money in the coffers.Secondly, to echo Magus' point...once you bring in this heightened tax revenue (again, generated by REDUCING tax rates), it is of absolutely NO benefit to our nation, citizens, and economy if government ends up spending as much or more than in years gone by, such that the deficit is not reduced (or worse yet, it widens even more).

While we have a warm place in our heart for the magic that is Coachella, there is something about the business of Bonnaroo that allows it to claim the crown as Best Music Festival in the U.S. This year's feat, the invention of the Roll Like A Rock Star VIP Package. This year, those willing to pay can enjoy the entire weekend like the artists, or possibly better than some of the artists who are lesser known. Watch your favorite bands from a private viewing area in front of the stage. Enjoy an open bar in the exclusive VIP lounge. Dine on gourmet cuisine rather than corndogs and pizza with your private chef. Lounge in luxury upon your private tour bus stocked with your choice of beverages and snacks. Beyond this, you get private transportation from the airport, a private area that is just for other wanna be rock stars, your own golf cart to cruise around the festie, and 4 biatches to have your way with. Ok, we made the last part up. But still, pretty sweet. There are only 10 buses that hold 4 people each, $5k per person. Who is with us?

Ford Models?

DBTH asked, and you answered! Our recent poll on How to Properly Tip a Bartender drew over 400 votes (at last count) and a lot of attention from our friends at the Times (Hi Frank!), Grub Street and Eater. After 2 days of voting, almost 69% of you said that $1 a drink is the proper amount, while a tip based off the quality of service received 19% of the votes. It seems that bartenders should not get their hopes up about bringing in more dough for slinging ordinary drinks and cracking open bottles, while mixologists should be raking in some additional cash for those delicious and more expensive concoctions. Thanks everyone for participating, even you miserly 1% who don't know what a tip is!

so what happens, when you get your drink lets say vodka soda... and drop a generous 2 dollars (its early and plan to stay for a bit) only to taste flat soda water and hardly any liquor, head back to to bar where one explains the soda water is flat, bartender tries said soda water in new glass and says will change it come back in a few minutes (uhm why not sorry and change it NOW)..., come back and it tastes like the same flat soda with even less booze poured into the drink in front of my face with more attitude.... sigh lesson learned, from now on vodka on the rocks!

As a bartender, $1 a drink doesn't bug me. It's when your part of six has me running for five minutes, sampling and tasting, getting you free munchies, and then watching you walk away leaving $1 on a $27 tab. Likewise if I end up serving you food at the bar, understand that this is full service!

A Little Birdy tells that Morimoto, Mr. Iron Chef, was looking into opening a more casual lunch space in the Chelsea Market building in the Meatpacking District, but that the plans have been put on hold because of economic pressures. We are giddy with the possibilities of Morimoto expanding beyond his high end Japanese restaurant, which along with Nobu, Masa etc. has become, dare we say, tired. Perhaps the ex-baseball player is looking to emulate the David Chang by going smaller and letting his immense creativity run wild. Alas, we will have to wait and see (and hope) if this project can come together.

Lord knows the one thing the meatpacking district needs more of is asian fare. God, every time the craving for chop saki hits, I feel like Magellean crossing the fucking continents to bring noodles back because it's such a massive distance between Asian eateries.

Marquee: The Harvard Case Study

***CONTENT
When do you know that you really have reached the next level in the nightclub business? How about when Harvard turns your club and company into a case study. So cograts to Noah T. and Jason S. on the achievement, as the future capitalists of America dissect Marquee's future after its run at the top New York club scene for the past 5+ years. The study details Noah and Jason's rise in the nightlife industry, the economics of running a nightclub, Strategic Group's impact on their bottom line, and perhaps most interesting, how reliant Marquee has become on promoters to drive customers to the club on a nightly basis. But like all good case studies, the question of where the business goes from here is put to the students. In this instance, Tepperberg says: We can ride it out. We can continue as we are, operate the business every day, go to work every day, try to keep doing the nearly impossible by staying in business longer than most nightclubs, and fix any problems that come our way. We could also take our team and move on to a new place, a new challenge - there are many pros and many cons to doing that. Or we could just put the club up for sale, and take an offer with a good price. Well, we know that they are focused on getting Earth up and running, and that interest in the 27th Street area continues to decline. So what are they to do? Bueller?

If you are a good little American, you should have already paid your 2008 taxes by now. If you are lucky, you may even be getting a refund. In these down times, you might as well go spend it on something extravagant. Carles from Hipster Runoff recently got back a few hundo, and came up with his own list, including: a) blow b) a prostitute c) 20 lap dances at $10 each We celebrate his choices, but wonder what kind of quality institution offers $10 lap dances in this day and age? Perhaps he should go see our friends at Rick's Cabaret, where HR will certainly benefit from swapping quantity for quality.

The minimum for good service is 20% of the bill, plus 20% of the equivalent value of the buybacks you receive. You need to make a good bartender want to see your ugly mug again. Of course, it is a two-way street. Obviously, the better the service the more the tip goes up. Lousy service gets nil by mouth.

Girls who don't pay for their drinks and get fancy fucking 18 dollar herb cocktails should pay 20% service since theyre not paying anything else. When I manage to flag down a bartender after 10 minutes at a crowded ass place, and he goes through all the work of capping a Yuengling for me, I think a dollar is more than generous.

A recent post by a Seattle bartender got our attention by proclaiming that the standard $1 per drink tip is no longer appropriate, saying that \"If you have received adequate service, it's best to leave about eighteen percent of your total bill for a tip. If you have received excellent service, go for about twenty-five or thirty percent so the bartender knows how well they did.\" As in, thanks for pouring me that $14 shot of whiskey, here's another $3 for a job well done. Let's hear how you, our faithful readers, feel about this by participating in the latest DBTH Poll. What's the Proper Tip? ( surveys)

You gotta be kidding me. Who gives these guys a right to complain when they get a dollar tip per drink, do you know how many drinks they pour a night. And really is it that hard to be a bartender. Go to school and get a real career and stop complaining about how you deserve more money for being the middle man in between me and my beer. For 50 cents id gladly grab it myself and cut you out middle man.

2009-03-30 12:36:00
i think it definitely depends on service. on something such as a beer, all it takes to serve is a pour or opening the bottle, and whether the bar charges me $8 or $2, i am going to leave $1 for a tip.. however, if there is a cocktail with multiple ingredients, shaking, etc. it will depend on service 100%. also, if you buy me a round, theres another $3-5 on top of what i was going to leave. you cant make a rule about this stuff.

Here in the UK it's not the standard practice to tip a barman for simply pouring a beer. We would tip a waiter or waitress after a meal but not a barman.

Does anyone here realize that Bartenders make less than minimum wage? They're on their feet for up to 12 hours a day, often serving morons (some of you I'm sure) and dealing with management. I really don't think that $1 on a drink is too much to expect. Now...on the other hand if you're at a very high end cocktail lounge where you're paying $15+ for a drink, and you just bought a round for you and a friend totaling $30, I DON'T think that 20% is justified.
digglesworth
2009-03-31 17:11:00
dood, c'mon now, the bartender gets a napkin, gets or pulls a beer, and places it in front of you, clears your empty, maybe wipes down your area. do i need to tip the bar back too? i was a bartender in a beer joint, a dollar a beer is fine, 20%? ridiculous. but remember, if you give me a 2 a beer a couple of times or 5 on three, i'll usually buy you one.
digglesworth
2009-03-31 17:14:00
oh yeh, and at chris, i've had this argument with my british and ozzie mates all the time, i know you don't expect a tip in non-us countries, but if i have a five and a beer is five dollars, i don't go in the bar, call it inherent guilt, but i expect to give the barman a buck automatically, just how we are mate.
EL
2009-04-01 12:03:00
$1 a drink is fine. If you're running a tab and the service has been excellent, then maybe 20%. I've bartended and understand what it's like on both sides of the bar. I never expected more than $1 a drink and was pleasently surprised whenever I'd get more.
newyorker
2009-04-07 19:56:00
I always tip 50%. This is true whether the tab is $20 or $2000. Call it my personal stimulus package. I did at one time work for tips, and the people who work restaurants and bars deserve every penny.

The scene at the Spotted Pig was especially rambunctious this past Friday, as two male patrons came to blows in the always crowded West Village spot. According to a Little Birdy who witnessed the brew ha ha, \"two guys started arguing with each other over bar stools that they each wanted for their women. It quickly escalated and punches were thrown. Six people converged and broke it up.\" It was our Little Birdy's first time at the Pig, and they remarked it certainly held true to its British gastropub roots. We were actually surprised that there wasn't a fight there earlier in the week for the final portions of the Mangalitsa pigs. [Photo credit]

Just a wee bit late, but we won't hold it against you. For those who can't wait, our LB says the restaurant space should be ready to go in 3-4 weeks, and the 18th Floor hospitality spaces should be ready by mid May. Standard!

I stayed there during the soft opening. The rooms have a clear glass wall that allows you to look into the shower/bath from the bed. That is sexy and kinda porno but not when you are sharing a room with a coworker. The front desk needs to advise or upsell to the rooms so one can have an option. But if this is a tryst.... well Also front desk-wise. Well this are some charasmatic interesting looking mofo's, intelligent, charasmatic but completely incapable of keeping track of package and communicating between shifts. But hey, they look good. The bellman well they are fuckable in that Ian Schrager way. Ian got love him for starting the good looking bellman trend. Charming Young , fuckable and well they open door and can carry heavy things... and for a large tip ( insert various ideas) sounds like for my money they should come with the room. Overalll this is a future sexy place, provided they keep the crowd like the other Balaz properties ( Marmont, Mercer ) The service issues will get better with time. I like the nice and dark vibe with the lighting and the fact the room is small with a big bed and potienal shower porn... I like .

It's not even April and the Roof Party is in full swing. First, 230 Fifth brings back the palm trees, and now we can tell you about Hudson Terrace, another new Midtown West locale that is there for your outdoor beverage needs. Located at 46th Street and the West Side Highway, Hudson Terrace is a former event space that has just made the transition to swank lounge. According to the intel, the design is \"Palm Springs modern\" and features private cabanas with individual heating/cooling units. Got to stay at 98.6, right? According to a DBTH reader, \"The place is much nicer then 230 Fifth and the prices are more reasonable. I asked a manager if the prices will remain the same during the summer and he said yes. Because its smaller and not a central location they might have a shot a being a really nice space.\" Will it be an after work crowd heading that far west, or a 10-4 crowd? And will it steal HighBar and the Empire's crowd? Let's see how this shakes out.

The warm weather is a sure signal that Spring has arrived. It's time to give a big welcome back to Roof Bar Season! Crowd noise! The folks from 230 Fifth Avenue are ramping up by bringing back the 70 palm trees that owner Steven Greenberg sends to winter in Florida every year and introducing a new warm weather cocktail list. The rub? The drinks will run you a minimum of $15, with Champagne cocktails going even further for $17. We guess that the 230 Fifth team was looking for that sweet spot between the Minetta Tavern and the Eldridge. Ouch. But that price does come with some fresh air and a view, which may make the price a bit easier to handle. Just a bit.

Larry Silverstein's plans to install a Four Seasons Hotel inside his residential tower at 99 Church Street have been put on hold indefinitely. The reason is standard - no effing financing, with Silverstein himself telling a recent New York Post/REBNY breakfast panel that the project \"can't be done without financing\". Lucky for you and every tourist, New York City is flush with luxury hotel options right now, and prices have never been lower. Lucky for Silverstein that when he does find financing, the market may have recovered and he can charge high enough prices to cover that sweet sweet debt service. [Via Real Estate Weekly]

Brooklyn's music venue dominance continues with the pending opening of Bruar Falls, a new music venue and \"funspace\" being opened by the Cake Shop team. Bruar Falls will be replacing the now closed Lucky Cat at 245 Grand Street, and will be open in the coming weeks. According to Brooklyn Vegan, the first show is scheduled for tomorrow, but the space may not be ready. No word if cupcakes will be available. [via BV]

The Pool Parties may be over, but that doesn't mean there won't be any summer music to enjoy in New York's great outdoors. Details for Summer Stage in Central Park and the Celebrate Brooklyn series at the Prospect Park Bandshell are starting to slowly trickle out. In the BK, MGMT's announced show has already sold out, and an August date for Animal Collective has just been announced. In swank Central Park, TV on the Radio kicks off Summer Stage 2009, with a variety of programming filling in the schedule. Sadly, neither venue offers Dodgeball. Sometimes you have to sacrifice.

***CONTENT
In response to China 1's refashioned basement lounge, a commneter and neighbor writes: This club is in the basement of my building, in which 25 families live, including young children and inform elderly. This club has been an absolute nightmare for we who \"live upstairs.\" We tenatns have spoken to China One's owner (Andrew Krauss) and management (Steven) on numerous occasions, sent them letters, called them up in the wee hours of the morning, and even contacted the landlord, all to no avail whatsoever. They seem to deliberatly not care that we cannot sleep at night, especially on the weekends, until after 4 a.m. because of the loud bass beat that literally throbs through the building and shakes the walls. I implore all to please DON'T PATRONIZE THIS CLUB! It is just a money-grubbing operation that doesn't care who it inconveniences as it just strives to rake in the cash. And how does Buddhism and the Obama Adminstration fit in? Find out after the jump! Worse, Krauss has said he donates part of the proceeds to a Tibetan charity outfit -- some buddhist! This new concept of theirs is also so racist it boggles the mind. The new Obama era is here and it's time to stop being so self-centered, ya'll -- get with the program, grow up, and contribute to the quality of life in our community instead of destroying it in your own self-indulgence. AND LET US SLEEP! Sounds like a plan.

I am in the camp that believes that well run bars and clubs can peacefully coexist with neighbors, and that clubs that don't make an effort to adequately soundproof and control patrons taint the whole nightlife industry. When this place was No. 1 Chinese, the empahsis was really on the restaurant operation. If management is not being responsive to your concerns, you should (1) try to meet with Susan Stetzer at CB3 to learn what can and can't be done, and (2) familiarize yourself with the SLA web site and try to determine if all the necessary permits, etc. were obtained when they switched over to China 1. For example, if they don't have a cabaret license, they can't let patrons dance. Booming base doesn't make a lot of sense unless folks are legally allowed to dance. (Yeah, the cabaret law is weird, but it is still the law.)

Another thought, sounds like you rent instead of own. If your right to quiet enjoyment of your apartment is impaired, you may be able to withhold payment of rent until it is corrected. Consult with a landlord and tenant lawyer or a guy like Barry Mallin. Then you can let your landlord fight it out with China 1 instead of you. The more comments come from guys like \"move\", the more ammo I will give you.
JB
2009-03-25 14:04:00
I can think of two courses of action for the tenants here: 1) call 311 every night and get through to the local precinct's non-emergency number and just keep making noise complaints. If you can get a guy from the DEP (Department of environmental protection) to come out with a decibel level reader they can issue tickets of up to $5,000. 2) either hire a lawyer (likely cost-prohibitive) or file a pro se lawsuit. The landlord is liable for the loss of use of property entailed with the booming noise and vibration (in legal terms, violating the covenant of quiet enjoyment/warrant of habitability). Technically you could stop paying rent, but it's always better to sue first. It takes a lot of time and effort, but small claims court is pretty simple and efficient. A better way to do it is to get all the tenants together and sue in regular court in a joined lawsuit for the value of all your rents. Hit a landlord with a couple hundred thousand dollar lawsuit and you'd be surprised how responsive they get to your position, especially if they don't have insurance that gets them a lawyer on retainer. It seems daunting, but unless people stand up to this sort of thing, irresponsible behavior like this will expand and continue in perpetuity. And by the way, people who are seasoned in the nightlife industry who actually have decent establishments care about their reputation/relationships with neighbors, china 1 however, is a shit hole.

Welcome to living in a city!! It's part of it! Frankly i'm a bit upset with everyone that complains about the noise...and all the community boards that are complaining about the number of clubs/lounges or liquor licenses that people are getting in their area. It's part of a city life...if you don't want to have restaurants, clubs, or lounges in your building...move to a building that doesn't have commercial space available to rent!! Problem solved!If there were no clubs, lounges, bars or restaurants (bug problems in buildings with them), then you would have a city or in this case an island that would never grow and your real estate value would be worth nothing to brag which is probably why you are living in the city. Most likely you wouldn't even live in the \"island\". All these \"clubs/lounges/ and restaurants\" is what fuels 60% of the NYC economy...Tourism, as well as locals going out for recreation is what helps attract more people to the city because of the buzz that is created, which in turn helps your real estate value from dropping drastically even in this recession because the demand to live in the city is still as high as it was before the markets crashed.

By all accounts, Keith's McNally's meticulously restored Minetta Tavern is a home run. The West Village classic is getting rave reviews for its menu and cocktail program, and non VIP's have been relegated to the dreaded 5:00 PM or 11:30 PM reservation options. Recently, we decided to pop in there on an off night to check the space out and sit at the bar to enjoy its cocktail program. Upon entering, we got what everyone was talking about. The Minetta's updating was indeed perfection, creating an authentic vibe that screams Manhattan. While every table was packed, the bar area had just enough space to sip a drink or two. But while we had already seen the cocktail menu, trying to choose from it brought on a wave of disgust. Did we really want to spend $14 on an Old Tom Collins or a Ginger In the Rye (a modified Dark and Stormy)? The answer was simply \"no\". Perhaps the re-design harkened us back to the now gone boom time, when clamoring for the right to overpay for drinks delivered some kind of payoff. But like Grant Achatz's belief that molecular gastronomy's time may be gone, so too may be the time of the $14 drink. $2.50 a sip ain't what it used to be. [Photo Credit]

On what was hopefully one of the final chilly nights of the year, with the wind whipping of the Hudson, the Rusty Knot celebrated it's One Year Anniversary with a festive get together of friends and pretzel dog lovers. The lead up to the Knot's opening was way overheated, as its owners Taavo Somer and Ken Friedman were knighted as saviors of the dive bar scene. But its opening led to the inevitable backlash, with many griping that the Rusty Knot was trying to hard to be a real dive bar. What phooey! Its 12 months of operation, capped off with last night's get together, proved that none of it matters. The place was packed with a mixed crew of people hoisting tiki drinks and enjoying free Busch beer, ordering up said pretzel dogs and savoring the return of the Chicken Liver and Bacon sandwich. Taavo even busted out a smoke machine and light show, making that corner of the bar uninhabitable, but kitschy nonetheless. It's day 366 for the Rusty Knot, and the place will just keep on keeping on, and that's all it needs to do.

Out in the BK, the Times Local goes deep into an ongoing noise war that would make CB 3 proud. The owners of Lox Bar and Ultra Lounge have been repeatedly visited by building inspectors, FDNY and a host of other City agencies due to repeated 311 calls from his neighbors. Owner Laki \"Roy\" McLaurin is at his wit's end, saying \"We developed this business to raise our families. When you have people who are trying to destroy that for whatever reason, you do feel upset about it. But I feel I can't do anything about it. I can just stay within the confines of the law and do what's right.\" Often, this is not enough for neighbors, who will probably keep on calling 311 and petitioning the local CB and councilwoman, impairing McLaurin's ability to operate.

As has been reported, the Rusty Knot is celebrating its One Year Anniversary on Monday by hosting a little shimmy at the West side nautical dive. We've been told that Chicken Liver and Bacon sandwich will be brought back as part of the festivities, which is great news for fans of its unique deliciousness. That means us. If you remember, it was just 6 months ago that proprietors Taavo Somer and Ken Friedman told DBTH that the sandwich is an item \"we all love it but it's not selling\". No word if this a permanent addition back to the menu, but much like the McRib, consume it while you have the chance.

It's been blogged about extensively and even featured on Fox local news, so we figured we ought to check out the schoolgirl promotion at Park Avenue Winter. So for those of you who need a refresher, this critically acclaimed bastion of gourmet cuisine has attracted the Murray Hill masses by offering a free meal (read: any appetizer, entree, side, and dessert, along with two free drinks) to any lady dressed in schoolgirl attire after 9:30 pm. We arrived early for our 10pm reservation to scope out the bar scene. The ratio of girls who have no hangups hiking up their plaid skirts and donning oxfords for a free meal to creepy single guys was about a million to one. Plus the food was delicious. And we drank loads of Pernod, so the fact that we remember that the food was delcious speaks volumes. Our waiter also let us in on a little secret, which we share with you, dear readers. Apparently they are equally willing to dole out the goods for both sexes. Guys, if you want to comp the $48 Dover Sole (highly recommended), you might want to lose your pride for a pair of spandex and a tennis skirt.

After taking down a few overpriced Sixpoint pints in DBA's backyard, we came across this sign outside the still open Holiday Cocktail Lounge. It looks like the new management has instituted the Attitude Adjustment Hour, offering a 12 oz. of domestic brew and some hot wings for $5.00. Not too shabby! And they got themselves a new chalkboard taboot, replacing the previous method of taping some paper to the pole. It's no McSorley's TV, but it is a step in the right direction.

Bad news for those wanting to take a weekday trip to the Cabin, the new subterranean speakeasy that quietly opened beneath the Pizza Shop on Avenue A. The space is only open Thursday - Saturday. Adjust your calendars accordingly.

scott, any deets on where the entrance is? i assume it's from within the pizza shop, given there's no exterior door to the place (other than the main entrance)...stopped by last night in an attempt to mill around and figure it out, only to find the shop totally empty (thus making our snooping a bit obvious)

East Village stalwart Cafe Mogador has been closed since Monday morning. No, this not because of DOH violations. Instead, the Mogador closed to undertake some long planned kitchen renovations, mostly dealing with upgrading their equipment. A sign on the door said the plan was to re-open again this morning, but work was still being done late into Wednesday night. Expect to see the same brunch crowd waiting there on Saturday morning.

Another day, another speakeasy. This time it's China 1 who steps into the fray with a super secret basement lounge to lure more patrons to Avenue B. The space previously hosted spontaneous dance parties, but it has been repositioned as a stand alone lounge. According to an email that is being sent around, to gain access you must: walk through the restaurant to the stairs in the back and go down. You'll find a bar. In the corner will be a blond girl with a clipboard. give your name, and she'll guide you to the hidden lounge. She'll also give you a clipping of film which you can redeem for a free drink at the bar. So mysterious. The space is designed to look like an ancient Chinese palace, and holds up to 100 people. The target crowd is \"models, agency reps, designers, photographers\", and even the staff will be models. Oh so beautiful. The lounge is unnamed, but the goal is to pick something that represents the \"notion of Western debauchery in a Chinese setting.\" That shouldn't be too hard.

This club is in the basement of my building, in which 25 families live, including young children and inform elderly. This club has been an absolute nightmare for we who \"live upstairs.\" We tenatns have spoken to China One's owner (Andrew Krauss) and management (Steven) on numerous occasions, sent them letters, called them up in the wee hours of the morning, and even contacted the landlord, all to no avail whatsoever. They seem to deliberatly not care that we cannot sleep at night, especially on the weekends, until after 4 a.m. because of the loud bass beat that literally throbs through the building and shakes the walls. I implore all to please DON'T PATRONIZE THIS CLUB! It is just a money-grubbing operation that doesn't care who it inconveniences as it just strives to rake in the cash. Worse, Krauss has said he donates part of the proceeds to a Tibetan charity outfit -- some buddhist! This new concept of theirs is also so racist it boggles the mind. The new Obama era is here and it's time to stop being so self-centered, ya'll -- get with the program, grow up, and contribute to the quality of life in our community instead of destroying it in your own self-indulgence. AND LET US SLEEP!

How tough is the hotel business these days? Multiple Little Birdys who still use A Small World forwarded this email blast they received yesterday, promising all members a buy one get one for 50% off at Ian Schrager's Gramcery Park Hotel. One LB comments, \"Hotels are getting DESPERATE, even the GPH, I wonder how Rose Bar is doing these days lol?\" Well, we know that Rose Bar is doing just fine, but selling $20 drinks is not going to pay off the buiding's debt service. In other Ian Schrager news, a Little Birdy tells us that work is progressing on the first batch of Edition Hotels, Schrager's much ballyhooed partnership with Marriott. Some of the pioneer locations include Istanbul and Waikiki, certainly unique destinations to launch a global brand. More news will be leaking through the coming months, so stay tuned.

I just read this ridiculous website. Rose Bar was great in Sept of 2006, when the idiots of this site probably still lived in Ohio. Word of advice; once ugly losers like yourselves are there, once promoters send mass txt about coming to an establishment to every one of us, the place is D.E.A.D
whatever
2009-03-19 11:45:00
Rose Bar is still consistently packed with a good crowd... The Hotel on the other hand I've heard is in the red - they have roughly $1 Million in operating costs each month they need to get to as a break even point. Hey Native Manhattan where do you hang out - UES?
Native Manhattan
2009-03-19 13:02:00
Dear Whatever,We \"Hang Out\" wherever our group of friends decide to have dinner and drinks after, but since I was born and bred downtown, normally there. You on the other hand, with your statement of \"consistently packed with a good crowd\"...if you idea of a good crowd is promoters that work at TenJune, you must be a Long Island Native, went to a Jap school like syracuse, wisconsin, michigan or the like... your idea of a \"beautiful\" woman is someone that is five foot four inches tall and weighs 130 lbs and wears close too tight, like a ten pound sausage in a five pound bag. Interlopers, go back to wherever you came from; the west village and soho where so amazing before the sex and the city wannabes came to ruin it. (P.S. I realize why sex and the city show was so popular; It allowed ugly short girls with busted noses to believe that they could be fabulous and sought after by good looking people.. keep dreaming)

It's all about the UES or UWS fool.Ps.I know you're just upset because you have never been to Rose Bar, it's a good place indeed, and no it's not for hipsters so your little analogy of guys in tight jeans is lacking. Enjoy Suzy Wong that place is made for Native people from Manhattan.

To all my fans;Since we were at \"Rose\" on opening night (with only about 85 people, none of which are you talking chimps) I know the difference between a great place (when rose opened or when double 7 first opened) and a place filled with talking primates (Rose bar now). \"Hipsters\" are another batch of losers and growing up downtown is a joke from those children from the UES or UWS that would get mugged if they venture to far from their co-op. Trust fund?! HA HA HA. Grandparents came from Western Europe you fools and only left us with something that money can't purchase; a great love of family. For those that equate $$ with being a joke, you are exactly the type of kid I would beat up as a kid. No one should feign poverty or drink bad beer (or beer period. Jack on the rocks please) You guys are and always will be LOSERS... go back to whatever small town you came from.
Colin
2009-03-19 19:43:00
Whenever someone drops the \"i would beat up as a kid\" they immediately lose all credibility. Clearly, Native Manhattan is the most in the know, popular Manhattanite on the block. Lucky for us plebs he graces us with his time on here arguing with people behind the total anonymity of a computer screen when he could be with all of his super cool downtown crew.

Native Manhattan,Cheers to your comments. These people from Kansas, Ohio, Nebraska, Indiana, etc. kill me when they come to the city and try to dictate what's hot. These cornballs can't be serious. They study a few seasons of Gossip Girl and now they're the authority?????? Give me a break. All these herbs will eventually go back to their mundane lives in the Midwest and tell stories to their inbred grandchildren about the good times they had in \"The Big Apple\"...Fucking meatballs.

2009-03-20 12:32:00
Dear over it,And where did you grow up? Connecticut? Thank you for proving my point. You make the absurd comment of someone who lives in a rent stabilized apartment should \"move out to make room for people with class\". Although I now own the building that I live, its that from the suburb mentality that equates those with less to those without having class. Quite the contrary; those interlopers that moved into manhattan after the Reign of Adolf Guiliani, have no class and believe that by purchasing a pair of louboutin shoes makes them a person with class. Everyone deserves to LIVE in New York or anywhere for that matter, but it's vacant people like yourself that have destroyed neighborhoods like Soho (that was once home to a vibrant artistic community and not a mall for you little J.A.P.'s with your nose jobs after your bot mitzvahs) or the west village. So thank you, keep taking the LIRR or Amtrak here. We need Manhattan to become a bland, vanilla, soulless place, safe for all the stroller mafias to roam the streets.

Pardon me \"Native Manhattan\", but the only real Manhattan natives are the Manhattoe Indians that sold this rock to the Dutch for beads and change. And being 1/2 Manhattoe, I am realer than your sorry immigrant ass will ever be. The bodies of my ancestors are burried under Rose Bar, and their tortured spirits wail every night that the white man pounds overpriced drinks while treading on the sacred ground in limited edition \"kicks\" and hooker heels. Go back to the old country and suck on a keilbasa. Euros in America ain't nothin but posers. Stick that in your peace pipe and smoke it.

Native, seriously.....shut the fuck up. For someone who claims to be all about the cultural diversity provided by the immigrant population in New York (like your grandparents from W. Europe), everything you say is very anti-Semitic. Whether or not you are a Nazi, if you are a true New Yorker, you would understand that while posturing (on a blog, no less) against people from the Midwest may be okay, making degrading remarks about someone's faith, ethnicity, or race is pretty unacceptable, especially here. No one cares that you were born here and that you \"own\" the building you live in these days. You are an unsuccessful piece of trash and should be ashamed. Also, talking about how you would've beaten someone up when you were a kid is about as cool as GPH these days (at least according to your evaluation of the place). By the way, no I am not Jewish. I just happen to take offense to your ridiculous remarks and hypocritical stance on essentially everything under the sun.

Wass wasn't the only NYC nightlifer to get some screen time in the Wrestler. Armin, the owner of the now closed Socialista, had a bit part of a doctor in the film. But it turns out the authorities in Iran (where Armin is from) were none too happy with the movie. According to the Observer: His father, Ali, had been taken into custody by the Iranian police for questioning. \"They came and picked him up at 7:30 in the morning, and basically they were asking about me because of my role in The Wrestler. Ali was released a few hours later. God bless America. [Observer]

And you thought Mexico was dangerous for tourists (it's not)? The US embassy in Japan is urging US citizens to avoid Tokyo's raucous nightlife district of Roppongi due to a surge of drink-spiking incidents. Apparently, criminals are spiking tourists drinks which causes them to pass out, and when they awake several hours later, they find their credit cards have been stolen. Heavens to Betsy! The embassy reports several cases of drink spiking, but the local police report no known incidents, which is rather contradictory. Either way, DBTH reccomends drinking from a sippy cup or not bringing credit cards out to Roppongi. Safety first!

The Uptown vs Downtown continues, as LX.TV/NBC Local pimps out Bruno Jamais and B.East as the poster children for their respective parts of New York. As always, the Uptown crew wants everyone to know that you really can have fun above 14th Street (dancing!), and the Downtowners represent that they are pushing the boundaries of hip with music, fashion and aesthetic. It's all so episode one of the City. Anyway, don't they know that there are so many other parts of town to have fun in?

A Little Birdy has kept up with the trials and tribulations of Arthur Kade, the former financial planner turned wanna be model/actor who spends his free time making trips to NYC from Philly. It seems AK found his way back to 1OAK, his fave place on earth, and it reaffirmed his belief that Binn is the single greatest doorman in the history of doors. Arthur says \"Binn at 1Oak runs the hottest door since Bungalow, and I have to admit he does an excellent job in making sure the girl to guy ratio is excellent, and the crowd is gorgeous.\" But Richie and Scott should beware, because Mr. Kade says \"If I ever open a lounge, he would be my first hire, because his look and attitude are exactly what makes the club so desirable to the \"elite\" of New York.\" And the d-bags from Philly.

Let's see, 1 oak is all a bunch of want to be someone's who will buy bottles, no one goes to beatrice anymore since you can't smoke that door is really a joke now any rinki dink parsons or fit girl can get in there. I guess the only hope for this city is rose bar, I don't know if its the recession or what but the doors at these places are a joke now and it sucks to be in places that were once good and fun filled with d-bag trash like this idiot from philly.

One positive trend since January has been the steady drop in airline prices and luxury hotel rooms. Naturally, if people lose their jobs or think a layoff is coming, the travel budget is a natural choice to chop. As the economy has continued to worsen, businesses have also cut their travel budget, which means there is plenty of room in first and business class on prime flights (NYC>London, NYC>LAX). As a result, airlines have restarted their upgrade programs, allowing coach customers to pay extra cash or trade in frequent flier miles to move on up to the front of the plane. This is in stark contrast to 2007-08, when fuel prices were high and planes were so packed that the chance to upgrade was virtually nil. If you have managed to squeeze in a trip or two, keep your ears open at the gate and you may just score some additional comfort and service on the cheap. [WSJ]

***CONTENT
Last week, DBTH was invited to take a tour of the still under construction Ace Hotel, where construction delays have pushed the opening to April 1st. And while the delays are disappointing, the old adage \"good things come to those who wait\" certainly rings true. Taking over a still occupied landmark building and then renovating it room by room is no easy task. Ask the Jane folks. So the Ace team is taking its time, and making each room unique, both to existing NYC hotel stock and to each other. We saw the model room, which has been finished for some time. We also checked out one of the $99 bunk bed rooms, which any deal seeker would be lucky to grab while the rate lasts through the year. A Superior King room is spacious and airy, with 2 leather sleeper sofas and a table large enough to hold a board meeting or impromptu dinner party. A most spectacular 1 bedroom suite was still under construction. When finished, the corner room will feature a custom built circular sofa in the living area, a king bed, and killer views into Midtown. And what about the rest . . . Perhaps the greatest work is being done in the hotel lobby, where construction crews are restoring the original tile floor that was buried beneath floor boards and 2 inches of concrete. Also being restored are stained glass ceiling panels and art work from the Hotel Breslin's hey day. The Ace hopes to open with anywhere from 4-7 finished floors, with the rest coming on line soon after. The restaurant space from the Spotted Pig team, Rudy's Barber Shop, and the event spaces, will not be ready until sometime in Summer 2009, but the rooms provide snacks and beverages at reasonable prices until then. This certainly isn't the best time to be opening a hotel, but the Ace's price point and unique position in the market lead us to believe that it will be a success.

It's always amusing to see branding gone awry. So we were certainly amused when we discovered the above map, prepared by the architects at ShoP as part of a South Street Seaport proposal for General Growth Properties, breaking New York's many diverse neighborhoods into overly simplified groupings. The East Village is now Hipsters, the Lower East Side/Chinatown is now Cheap Dumplings (ouch) and so on and so forth. The FiDi, where the Seaport is located, is re-branded Opportunity, which ties together nicely with the pending Water Taxi Beach on Pier 17. What do you think about your new neighborhood?

Besides the multiple arrests, a Little Birdy happened to be on the scene and filed a report, saying: the NITROUS MAFIA in full effect . . . the real \"parTTAyeeeing\" was back the various hotels just within walking distance to the show. I think the Days Inn took the cake for shadiest scene with \"wooks\" and \"mafia\" striking deals. Two rival gangs fighting over the nitrous tanks in & around the hotel. At one point around 2 AM, a couple thuggish-looking guys grabbed a tank and sped off with it, while this Tony Soprano guy started screaming his head off. Then, another \"capo\" looking dude came back 5 minutes later and personally apologized to Tony, and the two had a big public display of reconciliation. Meanwhile a dude who sucked too many balloons passed out and cracked his head open on the sidewalk in front of our room-- there was about a QUART of blood. no JOKE!!! The picture above was taken in the Day's Inn hallway. God help the family that picked this hotel as a place to stay on a weekend drive to see grandma. And for the kid in the blue shirt, 3 at a time?

Why do the folks running the Merkato 55 Saturday brunch party boast about how much money they are making? Maybe it has something to do with the illegal liquor they are apparently serving! According to a Little Birdy, \"Merkato 55 got busted for selling illegal liquor. Meaning they went to jersey and bought liquor.\" It's well known that booze is cheaper in New Jersey because of the state sales tax, so operators often head across the border to buy in bulk in order to reduce inventory costs. If it's true, Merkato certainly isn't the first to be busted for this crime, and certainly won't be the last. Meanwhile, a second Little Birdy updates us on the news that Megu is circiling the troubled space, saying that \"negotiations are still happening.\"

Buying liquor from \"outside sources\", meaning that the S.L.A. only allows you to buy from sources that are NY state regulated, is illegal. Actually it's quite a monopoly, there are only 3 major establishments to buy your liquor from. There are several wine merchants to choose from but in fact they're subsidiary's of the major 3! Beer however you can buy from any NY state wholesaler. I can tell you that almost every bar, tavern, club, or restaurant buys SOME of their liquor from an outside source. This shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone! Often in many cases you can buy certain products at the same price or LOWER then you could have from the big 3 ! It's a way to save $ and potentially not report the income as you never bought the bottle to begin with (WINK)

Patrons are served their domestic brews with whiskey backs by bikini-clad female bartenders, a real stimulating experience.

Behold the Minetta Tavern's extensive cocktail menu and spirit list, featuring what seems like some very tasty, if not expensive, cocktails and a variety of choice liquors. Of particular delight is a special section dedicated to Canadian bourbons, which have taken a backseat to the Americans labels in the past few years. Canadian Club for everyone, courtesy of DBTH!

Canada Bourbon is an oxymoron. Would be like saying \"American Scotch\" or \"Spanish Champagne\". These guys should know better.

ummmmm, last time i checked, crown royal and canadian club are rye's (i'm canadian and we call them rye). Bourbon by law (in the U.S) has to be 51% corn mash. unless our crops have changed drastically since the last time i was home, we don't produce any bourbon........

Yeah, there is no such thing as Canadian bourbon. It is Rye or Canadian Whiskey. The reason that very few Rye whiskeys are made in the U.S. anymore is due to the 18th amendment. After the U.S. government did away with prohibition, the American rye makers couldn't get the product back to market quick enough — due to Rye's long gestation period — and the Canadians swooped in to control the business. Anyway, Minetta best get its shit together. I ain't drinkin' no Alberta bourbon!

I really wasn't paying attention to anything other than the ignorant \"Canada Bourbon\" thing when I originally posted, and I was thinking this menu had something to do with the Martignetti Brothers rather than with Keith McNally's Minetta Tavern. Now I'm just really bummed. Are you telling me Keith McNally doesn't know what bourbon is? The guy is offered $100 million for this incredible business he's built and he makes a rookie error on the menu at his new place? Would be like Bill Gates not knowing what a hard drive is. Ugh. Mr. McNally: for the sake of bourbon lovers across the city--fix your menu.

Actully Canadian whisky can have very little rye in it at all. There aren't any rules to making spirits in Canada like there are in the US. That said, they can put pretty much anything in their whisky including corn, rye, and vodka. They can add other flavorings like sherry and orange wine. Basically, Canadian whisky as a whole is anything but whisky. Now, there are a few good ones out there but they don't start with a name like Crown or Seagrams

You can call us many things, but a Ping Pong hater is not one of them. But when we heard about the membership plan for Spin New York, the new members only ping pong club opening on Park Avenue South, we had to shake our heads. Spin is offering annual memberships for $60 a month or $600 a year for individuals, and $90 a month or $900 a year for families. For that hefty fee, members get access to: a 13,000 square foot ping pong social club on Park Avenue in Manhattan's Flatiron District. The club offers unparalleled table tennis courts, including Olympic quality cushioned flooring, 16 individual tables, and a stadium-like center court. In addition, SPIN New York houses a pro shop, lounge, bar, private room sponsored by Fred Perry and over a dozen internationally known professional coaches and players who are available for private and group instruction. Wow. Double wow. When cash strapped New Yorker's are budgeting their cash, somehow the $60 a month for ping pong access seems likely to be the first to go.

SLA Makes Minor Mod to 500' Rule

***CONTENT
Due to a recent court ruling, the SLA has made minor changes to the 500' rule, which mandated that any license application for a location within 500' of 3 existing establishments within the 500' zone be subject to a public hearing. The revised 500' law now differentiates between the types of exisiting establishments within the zone, hopefully making it easier to get a liquor licenses approved. Full release after the jump. 500 Foot Rule Announcemnt - March 6, 2009 The Alcoholic Beverage Control Law limits the ability of the Authority to issue on premises retail licenses when there are existing licensed establishments within 500 feet of the applicant's location. This has become known as the \"500 foot rule\". Applications subject to the 500 foot rule must have a hearing to determine whether it is in the public interest to issue the license. Until recently, the Authority applied the rule to any application where there were at least three existing establishments within 500 feet, no matter what type of establishments they were. However, as a result of a recent court decision, the Authority may no longer count all of the establishments within 500 feet of the applicant's location. The 500 foot rule will now apply as follows: If you are applying for a license under Section 64 to operate a restaurant, hotel or catering establishment, the rule will apply if your location is within 500 feet of three or more other establishments which are also licensed under Section 64. If you are applying for a license under Section 64-a to operate a bar, tavern, nightclub or adult entertainment facility, the rule will apply if your location is within 500 feet of three or more other establishments licensed under Section 64-a. If you are applying for a license under Section 64-c to operate a brew pub, the rule will apply if your location is within 500 feet of three or more establishments licensed under Section 64, 64-a, or 64-c. If you are applying for a license under Section 64-d to operate a cabaret, the rule will apply if your location is within 500 feet of three or more establishments licensed under Section 64 or 64-c. [Please note that the rule will also apply if your location is within 500 feet of another cabaret. However, in that situation you are not entitled to a hearing. The application must be disapproved.] Once the agency has done an investigation and verified that the 500 foot rule applies to your application, the hearing will be scheduled and all parties notified. All other review processes will continue to be performed during this time in order to avoid any additional delays. If you do not dispute that your application is subject to the 500 foot rule and a hearing is required, you can waive the investigation and the matter will be scheduled for a hearing. A 500 Rule Investigation Waiver Request form is available on our website under Retail Forms - Other Applications or Forms, or you can contact one of the zone offices to obtain the form.

We turn our eyes to Williamsburg, where the much anticipated Brooklyn Bowl isn't quite ready for the public. The original plan had the space opening in February, 2009, but obviously that date has passed and we still aren't rolling. Time for an update. A Little Birdy tells DBTH that the new opening date is targeted for May 1st, with the soft opening coming in mid-April. In addition, BB has teamed up with their neighbors from the Brooklyn Brewery to create a special brew for the alley, and that the first event will be a combination launch for the beer and Brooklyn Bowl. Our LB also says that the Blue Ribbon crew is testing out a French Bread pizza menu for bowlers and diners. Hot diggity. Until then, the bowling faithful will have to make due with the Gutter and Port Authority Lanes. Brooklyn Bowl [DBTH]

The second most referenced personality in the Sunday New York Times (behind the President) was none other than Steve Lewis, whose design work received not one but two shout outs. First up in Boîte was Aspen Social Club, in which a patron described the feel as \"Very retro-modern.\" Indeed. Next was an update on the recently renovated Webster Hall, where Uncle Steve \"added banquettes, tables, and a small likeness of Michelangelo's David, covered in green stripes.\" But of course! We congratulate our friend on the recognition, and only hope that we get an ode to DBTH on our birthday too!

A Lonely Night Outside BungalowA peculiar email popped into our Birdy Box this morning. A Little Birdy who is most definitely in the know just wanted to make sure we knew that a top nightclub operator had not been approached by Amy Sacco to buy Bungalow 8. We don't think much about Bungalow these days, but this denial of an unasked question got us wondering if Ms. Sacco is trying to unload the space after all these years, and if so, just who would want to buy it? We put on our Hardy Boys costumes and decided to do some additional sleuthing, reaching out to some additional Little Birdys to see if they had any songs to sing. One LB tells us \"they hear something new with her every day. One day she is selling it. The next she is going to redo it.\" A second tells us \"She's been trying to sell forever. But no one has wanted it.\" Ouch. That's a long way to fall for the former Queen of Cool. Meanwhile, the club still soldiers on for the few who still spend their time there, acting as a fallback choice to newer clubs that mimic the faux exclusivity that Amy helped popularize. As for a potential sale, a guru in these matters questions the chances, saying that the club \"isn't worth much anyway!\" Double ouch. But as far as she may have fallen, this is a town built by people given 2nd and 3rd and 4th chances. Amy Sacco may be down, but we certainly won't count her out. [Photo Credit]

Last year, DBTH broke the news that Eugene Remm and Mark Birnbaum would be bringing their EMM Group fun to Hoboken by opening a lounge at the soon to open W Hotel. Eugene sent out a blast this morning, saying EMM Group is pleased to announce our expansion into the hotel-lounge business with the opening of The Chandelier Room and The Living Room Bar at the W Hoboken on March 27th, 2009. The 4,000-square-foot indoor-outdoor venue will reinvent the concept of the traditional hotel lounge. Providing guests and residents alike with an expansive river view, the New York skyline serves as the ultimate backdrop as after work cocktails transition to an ideal night out. The Chandelier Room will set a new standard for great energy, great music and great service in the incredibly diverse city of Hoboken,NJ. Not said is how they will \"reinvent the concept of the traditional hotel lounge\", but we won't sweat those details. Hoboken has never been known for its glitzy nightlife, but maybe this will be the spark that lights the flame. Or a fancy hotel bar. Like the man said, the space opens on March 27th, and the room, pictured above, is resplendent with chandeliers. Natch.

I've had the misfortune of knowing Mark Birnbaum for many years. He has always been a misogynist, but as a nightclub owner, that is no surprise. However, I've heard him make a racist comments on many occasions, and there is no place for that -- especially when many of the people who frequent his establishments are minorities. For this reason (and many others), I do not support his tacky establishments. I hope he fails miserably.

Despite the daily barrage of bad news, there are some people that are either unaffected or choose to ignore the reality of the times. And according to a recent Twitter blast by master Steven Kamali, they may all be congregating at Cipriani's Downtown. Good for them! Too bad Giuseppe isn't around to enjoy the one part of his empire that is still kicking.

***CONTENT
Looking for the biggest party of the weekend? Perhaps you should turn your attention to Hampton, Virginia, the site of the much anticipated Phish reunion shows. It's been four years since the last one, and the nation's hippie dealers and nitrous outlets will be pouring into the sleepy industrial town, turning the arena's parking lots into the biggest narcotics market since they created Hamsterdam on The Wire. There is a fevered desperation by some Phish freaks to attend the shows, such as this Craigslist poster, who states: Such is my desire to see Phish blow the roof off of Hampton this weekend that I am willing to part with my treasured Jerry Garcia ashes, or rather a random soil sample from my backyard that I will lead you to believe are the venerable JG's ashes, in an intricate ploy to gain entrance. I will also throw in a reasonable amount of cash to make it happen. Don't fall for it ticketholders - they are trying to pull a fast one over on you. Anyway, if you have been troubling scoring, head down I-95 till you smell hippie.

The propietors are hopeful that they will be able to go 100% public soon, but until then, the space is still only open to private parties. Room rental will run you $400 for the night, and a bar guarantee of $1000, or you can pick one of the other thousands of bars in the City and pay nothing. Irwin M Fletcher you choose.

Following the Back 40 and Allen Delancey's lead, many new restaurants have announced sales on their cocktail programs. Spots like Little Giant (buy 1 get 1 free), Elletaria (half price from 5-7) have joined the fun, and we can't say we are upset by it. But, in these tough times, folks are always looking for ways to stretch a dollar. So before letting your minds become convinced that $6 for a Manhattan Flip is a steal, may we remind of you of the best booze deal in town. The Continental on 3rd Avenue is still slinging any 5 Shots for $10, which after figuring for tips, means you are walking out of there more drunk with more cash left in your wallet. Drink smart Birdys. [Photo Credit]

NY Barfly is reporting that the Knob Creek Distillery did not anticipate the growing demand for its bourbon, so they are facing a supply shortage through 2009. A rep for the company tells NYB, \"We could lower the proof from an honest 100 to something lower, change the age statement from 9 years to 8 years and 3 months or shrink the flask-shaped bottle. If we did that though, it wouldn't be Knob Creek. It would just be another bourbon.\" We agree, so either stock up now or switch bourbons. [NY Barfly]

Donald Nitti rules and is the only good thing about Southside. The rest of the place is whack, for real. The Hamptons have officially acheived \"The cheesiest place on earth\" if Southside opens in the old Bamboo spot. This is coming from someone that was born out there and has a place out there.

When most clubs think expansion, they usually look to Las Vegas, Miami, London or Dubai. Naturally. That's why we were surprised when a Little Birdy in Austin, TX (a Mockingbird, perhaps?) reported seeing a sign that Kiss and Fly was poised to open in the heart of the Texas capital, saying \"Just saw this . . . Either someone is ripping off the brand, which is super gay, or they are actually opening here which is super retarded.\" While we don't like your tone LB, we do have to commend your ability to read the tea leaves. By looking at the logo, it's either straight brand theft or a licensing deal. But unlike K&F NYC, Kiss and Fly Austin is billed as \"Austin's Only Gay Nightclub\". We thinks we smells a lawsuit. If you are in Austin and looking for some gay fun, the party starts March 25. It may not last long.

I give this 3 months, tops. I see it's in the location of the old Vicci, a club that was trying to bring the bottle service, pseudo-VIP, velvet-rope vibe to Austin. Despite pouring a ton of money into it and doing more advertising than every other club in the city combined, it didn't last. This city just doesn't have that kind of vibe. Hell, this is the place where a ratty old goth club was voted best dance club in the city. I wouldn't be surprised if the building's owners decided, after Vicci crashed, that they try an upscale gay club, since the gay scene here is a bit more amenable to that kind of crap.That said, are they really trying to say they're the only gay nightclub in Austin? There's Rain, Oilcan, Rainbow Cattle Company, Chain Drive, and those are just what I (an average straight guy) can name off the top of my head.

Well anyone that thinks Rain, OCH, and Rainbow are \"dance clubs\" obviously is straight. Dance clubs require clubby music that you dance to on a large dance floor. Rain and OCH have the house/techno dance music but tiny tiny tiny dance floors. Rainbow has the dance floor, but not the dance music.

I've been saying for years that Austin has needed a club scene, but I'm curious if it will work or not. I say, we give it a chance, but I think the vibe is all off and everything, but let's see what happens before we all start poo pooing it. The bar owner is straight and he has never owned a gay club before...but he saw what Rain was doing and made a business decision. (Yes, this is inside knowledge, not idle speculation) I say more gay bars is cool, but all it's going to do is move the same old queens to new venues. Oh, and talk about absolute iconic ripoff with the logo!!

More fun from the Eldridge, where unlike other lounges in New York, the customer is the #1 top priority. According to a Little Birdy, a would be birthday girl worked with club management to celebrate a special birthday with friends in the tiny space. When they showed up to get the night started, the entire party was turned away. Our LB says, \"she had planned it way in advance and they made her promise to buy several bottles of overpriced alcohol.\" Left out in the cold with the birthday potentially ruined, the group started working furiously to find an alternative. LB says, \"finally, bungalow took them (they got a table and bottles).\" You know they always have room. Another stunning example of the Eldrige being in a class of its own.

Set up a party at a douchey venue and plan to be treated like a douche. This girl sounds absolutely clueless. The party ending up at Bungalow (where I'm sure they bulked up that credit card debt on ridicululously overpriced hooch--Recession what??) speaks volumes. Sad that some people are so desperate for validation that they needed to trek to the opposite side of town for a \"name\" venue as opposed to hitting up any of the hundreds of bars within spitting distance of The Eldrige. Oh well, at least they got out of my neighborhood.

I think we need more information here... How did the girl go about setting up the party? Is she a regular at the Eldrige... (I'm assuming no since they didn't let her in at all)? Why didn't she just call the manager she reserved it with? While Bungalow is not the Bungalow of a few years ago they still try and keep it tight - so I imagine her party couldn't have been *that* ugly or a group of sausage fest. There is probably more to this story! I am sharping my sword for the Eldridge though.

Correction to the story: The entire group was NOT turned away at the door. Matt Levine called an hour before the party was supposed to start to say that The Eldridge had to close for the night due to water/plumbing issues. All tables/parties were forced to relocate.

When Philly Wants NYC, It Wants 1OAK

***CONTENT
A Little Birdy asked us to check out a recently launched blog that details the true story of Arthur Kade, a former model turned financial planner from Philly who 9 years later gives it all up to become a male model and actor again. Circles. In one recent narrative, our hero decides to head up to NYC after a stressful business meeting to unwind. What better place to do that than 1OAK, the coolest spot on earth, saying: we headed to my favorite lounge in NYC named 1Oak. For those of you who have never had the pleasure of partying there, imagine an ultra-exclusive lounge in Chelsea, with a celebrity doorman named Binh (always has a scowl, and doesn't care if you are a celeb or athlete, you can easily wait outside for 20+ minutes if he feels like it), and every hot celebrity, model and athlete gracing 5 feet past you trying to get the best table for bottle service. It's an experience all to itself. I love going there because I can listen to the hottest hip-hop music and meet beautiful women while simultaneously networking and creating material for the blog. Luckily, Binh now recognizes me, and when we went to the front of the line outside. How does it all turn out? Well, Mr. Wanna Be gets dissed by a model, blows a chance to network with a self made millionaire, eats at \"Pastis in the meat packing district for brunch\" and then heads back to the 6th borough. Failure personified. Meanwhile, the site gets entirely ridiculed, with comments such as \"You are such an amazingly large douche. Please keep writing; you can't script this douchiness. Keep up the good work D-BAG. I hope I see you in 1Oak - I would punch you in the crotch you loser.\" You can't make this stuff up. It leaves little doubt why so many places struggle to succeed in that neighborhood. 1OAK is successful as the main destination several nights a week, and its rejects feed into some of the surrounding spaces. But it's not sustainable.

this is utter destruction...\"You know I wasnt going to chime in as this guy is clearly digging his own hole but to better articulate what BIG FISH in a BIG POND said - Mr. Arthur Kade - you ARE a wet flapping douche bag. Are you serious with this? How much more less profound, more self-centered and utterly useless of a human being can you be? What compels you to believe that you have any capacity to provide anything useful to anyone by ranting in non-coherence and poorly written sentences about your meager life? You need to stop pounding energy drinks, chest bumping your boys, referring to yourself in the 3rd person (you really did that!) and making ridiculously effeminate facial expressions in airbrushed photos of yourself. Glamour shots anyone? Did you not see Zoolander? You know that wasnt a documentary right? It was a comedy. Much like this blog, the notion that this was an important next step in your life, and more specifically, your existence. You’re aspiring to be a male model? Really?! Dream big buddy. Keep hope alive. You will be your generation’s greatest contributor. C’mon man - grow the fuck up. Let me fill you in on a little something. I’ll make a bet with you. Ask any one of your straight guy friends to look at the pictures at the top of this site. You know the one where you could totally be getting blown by a dude under the table, the one where you’re glancing over your shoulder after doing 150 curls with 70 lb dumbbells, and the one where you’re popping your collar (popping your collar in a picture - and being serious??? god you’re a fucking loser) - and ask them: Do you think I’m a joke? Do those pictures make you want to laugh at me? Ask them to be totally honest. It’s important. I guarantee you, Mr. Arthur Kade (aka. Dr. Douchebag), not one of them isnt laughing to themselves. They may not say it to your face - but there is not a single doubt that you’re actually the butt of everyone’s jokes. You look like a complete asshole. I’m giving you advice that nobody else will - you are completely playing yourself! You think abbreviating places you go to makes it sound like you belong there? Bags, Gans, Oak. Hey asshole, “Bags” and “Oak”, as you so eloquently put them - are old news. You’re bridge and tunnel. We call you a tourist - a wanna be - a doesnt matter. You drive up the NJT to come to this city b/c you can go back to Philadelphia with a sense of accomplishment. I partied with the cool guys! I was in the same room as people who have actually done something with their lives! The mousse you use in your hair should be pissed that it has no option but to be associated with you. How old are you anyway? You are still name dropping clubs, restaurants, and promoters?? How is it not clear to you that you sound like a complete ass? Dont you remember “Look at my striped shirt”?? It was FUCKING JOKE Arthur Kade. It wasnt meant to be serious. It was making fun of people like you who didnt say these things out loud but definitely thought them. It was a narrative from within the representative douche bag’s head for all of us to laugh at what these guys probably thought. And guess what? You actually went and wrote out those things down - elaborated on them further than the original author ever intended - and were SERIOUS!!! You unprecedentedly ignorant asshole! Man oh man - does it get any better than that?? In case you dont realize how much of an asshole you are, I will copy and paste the “Look At My Striped Shirt” narrative here for you. FYI, this was so popular it became a blog (as a joke, you fucking retard), then a book (again, a joke, you asshole). Compare what you wrote - to what I’ve copied below - and tell me you are not the captain of all fucking losers, that your few blog entries are entirely encapsulated in this joke from 2003. Then do us all a favor: recognize your douchebaggery, own up to it, and come to terms with the fact that you will never really actually amount to anything. Your purpose here was to entertain us all and remind us how much cooler we all are than you. You know the rest of us who dont give a flying fuck about how easily you think you can get into a club, date a “supermodel” (ya, ok), “chill” at places”, assign code names to people as if you’re in some secret club (secret club of curly haired fags), “mac” on “bitches”, and all the other superficial, non-contributory, bullshit activities you engage in that you think matter to the rest of the world. And just so you know, Arthur Kade, I have done all you have done and more, accomplished more than you ever will, traveled further and longer than you will ever afford, have access to any club or restaurant I please, been with much finer women than you can ever claim, am probably a few years younger than you, and have a self-made fortune you couldnt even dream of. I have everything on you - yet never once felt compelled to distribute this information to anyone - because its meaningless (yes, absolutely, unequivocally meaningless) - unless I was trying to showoff in front of an audience whose mental midgetry was so severe that they’d actually think it made me cool. Since you’re the first person I’ve come across that fits that description - there you have it. In your own distorted view of what’s important and what has any value in this world - I am WAY cooler than you. Now for you to learn a little about yourself, here it is, your moment of zen….Look at my button down striped shirt! Fucking look at it! This shirt means one thing! I’m coming home with some pussy tonight! That’s right! It’s been a long week at the office and it’s time to blow off a little steam! I am a Junior Vice President! I have business cards that say “Junior Vice President” on them! They’re glossy and magnificent! Here! Have one! Take it!My boys are coming out with me tonight! They all have striped shirts too!I figure we’ll kick off the night with some Golden Tee! I am going to smack the shit out of that little white ball! It’s going to be so fucking loud! I’ll bet I can drive that pretend golf ball 600 fucking yards tonight! I’m that fucking pumped!I can almost taste those Jager Bombs right now! I fucking love Red Bull! I put it on my God damned cereal! I’m crushing one right now!I’m thinking about buying a boat this year!I’m gonna fight someone tonight! I pray to God someone makes eye contact with me! I will beat his ass! And God help him if he gets any blood on my striped shirt! If he does, I’ll scrub it out with his dick and some bleach! I mean it!I’m gonna grind on girls asses tonight! You heard me! When I see a group of girls dancing in a circle, I will select the most attractive one and dry hump her until it hurts! I will rub my cock against her so that she can feel my throbbing hard on!I will valet tonight!I will treat the valet with contempt and make sure that he knows that I am superior to him in life! I will tell him to “Take it easy on the brakes, Champ”!I will talk to people I don’t know about my job tonight! They will all know that I am an important man! I will call female bartenders “Babe” and male bartenders “Chief”!When I do not hook up with a girl at that club, I will say that the place is “full of skanks”! We will wait in a long line to go to another bar only to strike out again!I will give up and decide to order a gyro off of a street vendor! I will make fun of him to my friends for being foreign! I will look ridiculous purchasing my gyro because people will be able to tell by my striped shirt and tinted sunglasses that I struck out and am settling for a gyro!I will make one last attempt to hook up by trying to coax two big girls who are also ordering gyros to coming back to my place for “after hours”! When they say no I will make fun of them for being fat! I will leave!When I get home I will go to the bathroom and hold the straight razor to my wrist again! I will gently drag the razor laterally against my vein, making sure not to actually cut myself!I will then go to my room and pass out! I will need some shut eye so that I’ll be ready to fucking party again tomorrow!-A Voice of Reason\"

honestly though..a choice excerpt.After watching 5 years of existence towed away, I proceeded to head to my dermatologist to get medicine for my pimples. It’s amazing that at my age, I still have minor acne (nothing very noticeable, but an occasional cyst like growth), and although I have always been lucky that it hasn’t affected my modeling work, it definitely makes me feel self-conscious and insecure when I am out. I feel like any time I meet a beautiful woman, the first thing she notices is a pimple that I may have on my chin or forehead, and once the new cycle of Accutane is done, I will hopefully never have to deal with this again. Three weeks ago, I was doing background acting work on Gossip Girl, and had the opportunity to stand within 2 feet of Chace Crawford, who is the star of the show, and the new “it” boy of television, and what struck me as remarkable was the perfect skin he had. He was a good looking and charismatic guy, but his skin was flawless, and all I kept wondering was what it was like to never wake up with a pimple.really?

Breaking news across the Birdy wire! Updating this morning's rumor, Megu has been in discussions with the landlords and leaseholders to take over the troubled Merkato 55/Bijoux space in the Meatpacking district. According to our Little Birdy, \"it is an extremely complicated situation\", making the deal probable but unlikely. It seems logical that if a deal was reached, Megu would bring its new M Lounge concept to fill the Bijoux space, while the upstairs would function as a dedicated restaurant. It is the MPD, how can they not have a lounge? And if they are negotiations with Megu, the end for the famed Merkato brunch party is certainly near. Sigh. We will continue to post as this story unfolds.

Is your nightclub heading under water? Looking for a way out? A current Craigslist ad promises you that bailout you have been looking for, saying \"Owners/operators of NYC's most sophisticated cocktail lounges seeks to invest/acquire distressed Manhattan lounges.\" There are plenty of quality operators who made a crap ton of cash over the past 8 years who may be looking to swoop in like vultures. But just who owns NYC's most sophisticated cocktail lounges? Let's talk about it! 1. Noah Tepperberg and Jason Strauss - As owners of Marquee and the soon revamped Earth, as well as their Vegas projects, this dynamic duo certainly has the cash and wherewithal to pick up choice properties. But with the Vegas market slumping and a new project on the way, do they want the headaches? And do they own the most sophisticated cocktail lounges? - Probability: 35% 2. Richie Akiva and Scott Sartiano - Their 1OAK and Butter spaces keep plugging away, but rumors about cash flow issues persist, meaning they may not have the ability to make multiple purchases right now. These guys may want to seem sophisticated, but come on. Probability: 10% 3. Sasha Petraske: The master of cocktail sophistication seems to have his hands full with the ever changing Milk and Honey, the problematic Mercury Dime, and a new lounge opening in Long Island City. Probability: 25% 4. Matt Levine: We have heard rumors that the New York City Council has passed a Local Law banning him from getting involved in additional project. Probability: 0% 5. Julie Reiner: The successful proprietor of the Flatiron Lounge and Clover Club has been riding a hot streak of late. Both spaces are uber sophisticated, and she may be able to pull together the financing to slowly expand her empire. Probability: 60% The result? We really don't know, but look for someone under the radar like Ms. Reiner to be looking to make deals and position themselves for a big take if and when the economy starts ticking upward.

I added a blog a few days ago under the top 10 clubs in nyc.. I proposed a venue that i have come accross last week during fashion week that i believe has the potential to becoming a great space for a weekly party.. I will be sending a propsal and will be speaking with the GM to see if we can start one night a week. I am interested in starting slow, and drawing the right crowd instead of ramping up and for it to turn into a shitshow.. I am not looking for it to be exclusive, but we will be selective... After we have built a following we will create something different in this space and mix fashion, art, live shows, different artists displayed, upcoming fashsion designers to display their newest lines, Djs, burlesque, etc.. This will be something competly different than any venue NY has seen in a while. Every party will focus on something specific.. A little taste of everything that makes NY so great. So each party will be something different every week.. This way a following will be built for each industry and fuse these crowds together. It will be a very lose flowing party... instead of the clique shit we see in the clubs nowadays. All serious inquires email me at adisilvestro@gmail.com. Again I will not say what the space is until I get more details from the GM.. I want to put togheter the next great team of promoters, all bullshit aside.

Noah is the safest bet in this business. After 12 years in nightlife I have learned one thing......Noah is smarter, works harder and is more respected then any other person I have met in this business. The failures in Los Vegas are world problems that have nothing to do with Noah and Jay. Almost every promoter, owner and \"nightlife Marketing\" company in NYC models their business after Strategic group. i am really not one for kissing ass or talking people up but, Noah deserves nothing but respect.

2009-02-27 11:29:00

People are so fickle. Of course Marquee wasn't what it once was, but for years they made tons of money and were a thriving establishment. They still do good numbers and its ridiculous that everyone hates on SG and Noah. So now 1Oak is hot and people have jumped on their band wagon. These same people that are hating on Noah and SG will be sucking the cocks when their new spot opens. And these bloggers will be throwing 1Oak under the bus when there run is through just as their doing with Marquee.

Noah is extremely gifted and will ultimately succeed....And 1oak is the shit! Don't hate...there are great times to be had there!

Now if they can only do this with Vegas nightclubs we'd be all set. A bunch of Las Vegas clubs are starting to go under due to the economy...I wonder if these investors though are hurting more than helping these clubs.

Rumor of the Day: Megu Heading to MPD

***DATE
2009-02-26 08:36:00
***CONTENT
Just when we were wondering if the Meatpacking District was bound to be a culinary wasteland, a commenter drops a huge rumor* that sent our heads a spinning. According to said commenter, \"Word has it that Megu is in negotiations with Merkato.\" Crazy. Megu is a fine establishment with a global reputation for luxurious Japanese cuisine served by an expert staff, and we would have to think plunking itself in the heart of the MPD action would be a successful venture, giving tourists and corporate types one more option to go big in the hood. But is it an original dining concept that is choosing the Far West Side to make a go of it? Hardly. It's two NYC locations already do a brisk business. This is akin to Nobu opening on 57th Street - a big concept with a huge up front cost, but with little risk, unless customer's appetite for Japanese cuisine wanes. Fat chance. We will wait to see how this plays out. *Again, this is only a rumor. We welcome additional information.

This week, it was revealed that the much beloved Water Taxi Beach would be expanding from LIC into 2 Manhattan locations. A Governor's Island announcement soon followed, but the mystery of the Manhattan space has still not been revealed. Until now. A Little Birdy tells DBTH \"Its going to pier 17 at South Street Seaport.\" The location makes sense, both for its proximity to the Water Taxi dock, and the influx of tourists and commuters who pass by the Seaport on a daily basis, and seems to have everything lined up to be a smashing success. Who's ready for summer?

Image courtesy of NY Times How did we not know about this? A new sex club has opened in the Gowanus neighborhood of Brooklyn. The unnamed club, run by a Mistress Wanda, \"is open only on the weekends, and the cover charge will not break the bank: $40 for couples, $90 for single men. Unescorted women, who are sex-club gold, are allowed in free.\" Added bonus comes in the form of handy wipes for the sex stalls and free condoms! [NYT]

Is Bijoux headed for a quick exit? Commenting on the so called Top 7, a reader questions Bijoux's place on the already questionable list, saying \"Bijoux is for sale. How can you even add that to the list? They closed 3 nights off their week and losing money.\" We can't help but wonder if they are referring to the entire Merkato 55 space, which failed miserable as a restaurant and is now operating as a Saturday afternoon brunch party. Bijoux is popular with the Euro crowd, but the whole project has been a disaster from the start. In this economy, it may just be time to cut bait and recoup whatever money a sale may generate. But this leads to another question - is it possible to open a new and successful dining venture in the MPD, or is the neighborhood destined to be a culinary wasteland, attracting tourists to its high end boutiques and cheesy nightclubs? We know the refashioned Lotus is going to give it a go, but have serious diners already dismissed it as a \"why bother\"?Or is possible that one of the most unique neighborhoods in the City can somehow escape this downward spiral into No Man's Land and become a place that its residents will visit?

Bijoux is doing horrible. They are losing $20,000 a week in payroll. I know this for a fact. They closed on Tuesdays, and Wednesdays, contemplating closing on Thursdays now, and just open on Fridays and Saturdays. The Saturday brunch party is paying Bijoux rent and Bijoux expenses. It is keeping Bijoux a live. It is all tied together. When Bijoux loses $20,000+ a week, the money made from Merkato goes to paying Bijoux expenses. Not only that, but Bijoux uses an abundance of promoters, and its \"owners\" were on a salary, the operations were a mess. This is all inside information. You should see the books on this place, falling miserably, its bad, and unfortunate, because I personally thought it would change the climax of the meatpacking.But yes, I agree, the meatpacking is DONE.

Shocking that a place that has seemed to attract a reasonably good crowd can be doing so poorly economically, goes to show the strange economics of nightlife anyhow. With regard to MePa and resto's, with the exception of Del Posto / Morimoto on the outskirts I can't think of any really good eateries in MePa proper? That being said there is no real reason there shoudln't be one assuming the rent is reasonable - Convivio seems to be making a run of it in Tudor Place which is a part of the city I didn't even know existed, so why wouldn't the right establishment do well in MePa?

I posted on this site weeks ago how Bijoux / Merkato was on the death watch. Merkato is losing money and losing it fast. They were under financed when they opened. Bijoux and Merkato have the same owners. The rent is astronomical. The problem with this spot and most of these spots in the meatpacking is the rent. Now, Everyone is talking about how lotus has a chance (whatever they call). Two things to note - The rent was cheap for the location when those guys took over the spot but, they have been sitting on the space for well over a year. During that time the rent has doubled and is still going to escalate. Additionally it is a very expensive project that is obviously under funded. This isn't the same market it was when they opened Tenjune. In the end the meat packing has a few places that have good food and those places seem to hold their own. the places that have bad food and have poor management are failing.

Merkato 55 was a misadventure from the start, I don't think it is fair basis for any sort of conclusion regarding the MPD. Pastis is there and crowded 7/365, Soho and Norwood house host top-shelf private events. The failure of Bijoux is probably mostly economics, with lower costs they'd probably manage. Possibly the promoter-driven nightclub economy is at an end. Or maybe the MPD rents need to normalize.More interesting questions: What about the re-opening of Double 7? Does that still make sense? Why do people open terrible restaurants like Merkato 55 with bad service and bad food?
doing horrible
2009-02-25 16:34:00
I think it is the end of promoter driven places. The most important aspect of nightclub business is having an owner as a built in promoter, and of course, keeping your rent very low. The moment you start paying promoters, its the downfall to anything. If you look at places like Beatrice, Rose Bar, Eldridge, you can even throw La Esquina, and Bowery Hotel into that mix, they don't use promoters. I know Eldridge rent has been publicized and low, and I am sure Beatrice rent is low. Rose Bar will always survive, and if you notice, out of those 3 places, they don't care about money, and they don't really use promoters. But most important, is the rent. Second is not using promoters. Third is not \"selling out.\" Even 1Oak is selling out. It's all suits, wall street people, and so on. If you want longevity in this business, you can't \"sell out\" for quick money. I think Tenjune did that too quickly in the MeatPacking. I even heard Chloe is paying promoters now. There rent is probably very low as well, but their crowd doesn't buy drinks or bottles, so I can't see it even paying rent.But I believe it is the death of Meatpacking, with rent so high, you need to \"sell out\" and bring in money whatever you can to pay rent. Are you going to say know to wall street guys wanting to buy bottles? Absolutely not if you have a $40k rent. So what's the next hot location? Southstreet Seaport? LES? Financial District? West Village making a come back?

I'm neutral towards Bijoux, but I doubt Merkato 55 can cover the bills for long. I've been there for dinner and Saturday brunch. The dinner service was polite but the food sucked. The food sucked even harder at brunch and I was appalled by the douchey amateurs manning the hostess stand and door. Our server and the downstairs bartender were lovely and I didn't even mind the three cheesy promoters milling about, but the hostess & door guy were horrific a**holes.

I remember this fall going there on a Friday and walking out because I was the only person around at 1am. And then a few weekends later it had a huge line outside and you could hardly move inside...

DoingHorrible you are missing a couple points that most people leave out. Rose Bar is in a expensive hotel with a built in revenue stream from hotel guests. in addition they have Nur Kahn and Frank Roberts on staff who are promoter types. No stand alone venue could afford the luxury that Rose Bar has being that it is in the Hotel. That would mean the same for Bowery. Eldridge is very small and Matt has done a good job. Beatrice doesn't make a lot of money. They keep it slow and steady and over the long run they will make a great return on investment but they don't make the kind of money the bigger places make.You guys can all talk about selling out, using promoters, etc. This is business. This is real life. Of course a place like 1Oak or Tenjune are going to let in suits. they do 6 figures a week plus. They probably profit about 20% on that. That's a lot of money. They can be hot for 2 years, double or triple their money and then do it all over again. Tenjune is almost 3 years old. I think they were profitable after 6 months. That means 20 cents on every dollar since then has been pure profit. Its a great investment.I'm just tired of the whole Beatrice Hipster types are the coolest people on earth who don't sell out. I know most of those kids and they are rich kids spending dad's money pretending to be broke. What exactly is so cool about that. I like the spot. I like the concept of the place. Matt and Paul deserve a lot of credit and respect but, the people who post on here make it sound like beatrice is what NY nightlife should be about. the truth is Mansion is more NY then Beatrice.

great point, i agree, some people idolize these hipster type places, and i def. don't agree with that, i agree with your post on nur khan and rose bar, i agree with beatrice, and i do give credit to matt, to everyones surprise, that small place is keeping it cool while doing big numbers, and not \"selling out\" - what i disagree about, is that if you follow that \"suit\" mentality, you will be like every other hot club of the moment, the key word \"the moment.\" the reason why nur, paul and matt will be around for a while, is because they don't give in to \"quick money.\" I would have to say that Paul probably doesn't make money, but he has built a following, and a brand which he could turn into dollars, but I have been in Rose Bar seeing champagne flowing, as I have also been in Elridge and seen champagne flowing. Marc and Eugene are very smart guys, they know what they are doing, I trust they will get through these tough times, but I am worried about Richie and Scott, I really don't believe they have that \"business\" mentality from what I see. There is one thing to \"be cool\" and there is one thing to \"be smart\", this business is about being both, which most club operators and owners don't understand.Is it worth putting $3 million into a place and \"being cool\" or getting your investors money back? Ask the meatpacking district club owners...

It's freaking cold out there, Little Birdys. Really freaking cold. That's why this little number warmed our spirit up, since the warm is on its way. But while we pine away for the heat, we are fearful that season's summer rental season out east could be in trouble. The reason? A Little Birdy forwarded us a message he received from one seasoned rental operator who is now shilling for a workout routine, saying \"They normally do not discount their fee for anyone, however, she has agreed to allow me to offer to my friends and those on my email list 50% off\". Anything to make an honest buck these days.

Foreclosed houses are everywhere! Everywhere! What good is an empty home that is owned by a heartless bank conglomerate? Well, some kids in Florida came up with at least one reason, when they decided to throw \"a raucous bash that caused about $75,000 in damage and resulted in the arrest of 17 partygoers.\" Besides broken windows and wall damage, officers shockingly found Bud Lite on the inside the 4,000 SF home, which is currently owned by Wells Fargo. The room above was converted into the \"Sex Room\" and the \"Gettin' Booty Room\", a real double threat. Hopefully, some kick ass lofts will be seized here soon, so our disaffected youths can go all foreclosured on them. [TSG]

Photo via GoaG, PMc While we have never been a fan of bottle service, we certainly have understood it's place in the nightclub business. Then, a bottle with juices, soda, and red bull wasn't enough. How could you top it? Sparklers. Crowding into a table and paying a 300% markup had to start coming with a $.10 wanna be firecracker to make patrons feel all warm and tingly inside, helping expand the \"look at me\" nonsense that was pervasive in the bottle buying culture. When it was Dow 14,000, that was well and good. People wanted a sparkler for buying a PBR, nevermind Moet. But things have changed. People have changed. Hell, Grandma Clara has become an internet celebrity for sharing her depression recipes, because that's what we're all going to be eating in another six month. We're not saying to stay home, waiting for the word to crack open each other's skulls and feasting on the goo inside. But maybe, just maybe, it's time to lose the sparklers.

Surprise #1 is #5, Max Fish, which is described as a place for \"hipsters and wanna be hipsters\".

This done right has the potential of competing with 1Oak.. .and personally this is even a better space and location. all serious inquires please email me...

List isn't totally off. I'd argue Beatrice / 1OAK / Southside / K&F / Santos are all somewhere in list of better places to go - varies so much on what you are looking for in a night out though. I don't think there is any legitimate concern about these places being diluted - Santos is not for everyone (thankfully) and the rest of them have difficult enough doors that it de facto limits the amount of out of towners who are getting in. Goldbar and Bijoux probably should be on the list ahead of anything aside from Beatrice / 1OAK / Santos though, odd oversight as they are both pretty well known venues. And The Box, despite the routine getting a little tired by some peoples estimation, remains a unique venue that is pretty hard to replicate.

Being a lover of most things German bar related, we were pleasantly surprised to come across Wechler's Currywurst, a new brat/sausage/wurst and beer joint that quietly opened last week in the East Village. The tiny space serves up a variety of sausage flavors from the famous Schaler and Weber in Yorkville, and offers several choice German brews on tap. Even better, grab a table at the International Bar for their Dow 7,000 cocktails, and then take order a few brats to go and carry them next door. A winning combo every time.

An Evening At: Above Allen

***CONTENT
A boutique hotel in the Lower East Side with an exclusive lounge that is in soft opening mode now, soon to be open only to guests and card carrying members. Been there, done that. But we decided it was our duty to check out Above Allen, the new lounge at the Thompson Lower East Side, to see if this was just more of the same, or if the space could distinguish itself as unique in a crowded field. The verdict? Dare we say a success? We dare. The greatest aspect of the lounge is its location 7 stories above ground, allowing its guests to seemingly hover above Allen St (get it), with breathtaking western views of Lower Manhattan and Midtown. The music was good, the scene was lively late into the evening, and the drinks, while on the expensive side, were certainly not eye gouging ($6 beer, $11 cocktails). The hassles were relatively minor. Getting inside was a chore, because the doorman was perched in the lobby and had to lead every approved party upstairs in a crowded elevator. Tables were reserved, but loosely, in that we sat at several throughout the night when they were not occupied, and were never asked to leave. Coat check was mandatory, although there were people with coats everywhere. But all of these things can be filed as growing pains for a new club that will soon transition into members mode. So we suggest you make an effort to head down to Allen and Houston before they pull the member lever, at least to experience the view. And stay for a drink or two while you're at it.

i was there on a thurs night 2 or 3 weeks ago. i had diner at Shang and wanted to check out the space. No one at the bar or restaurant on the 2nd floor had any idea if it was open or not, or how to get access. Same goes for everyone in the lobby. I finally just asked a housekeeper to swipe her card in the elevator to get to the 7th floor (which she probably shouldn't be doing, but did anyway.) When i got in it was a little after 11 and there was a total of 3 people there, yet they had velvet ropes set up. in my opinion the space was fine, nothing to write home about and not worth the gymnastics it takes to get in.
well...

HAH...! Another membership lounge, ask how that worked out for Eldridge and Milk and Honey. Good time to limit your revenues to people who may or may not pay a membership fee in the depths of a recession. The inestors will be happy to hear about this one. They better be getting used to the 3 people sitting at the bar rather than trying to keep a velvet rope and card access to the 7th floor. Give it 3 months before they open it up when they see everyone flocking to the thousand other rooftops lounges once the weather warms up.. what dont these people get!? nobody gives a shit about private memberships anymore..

Its tough to have a club operating on the 7th floor with eventual B&T wanting to get inside every Friday and Saturday night. It's not a real revenue generator, or hopefully won't need to be, when the hotel is fully operational and is charging a lot of money for guests. It's not their for cool factor, it's there to be the hotel bar.

yea cause the hotel guests are going to want to spend their entire stay inside a hotel and not trek out into the manhattan scene... your going to get the pre dinner rush, be dead from 9 oclock on... and maybe get some straggelers coming in all drunk after a night out. Good job.. way to forecast.

KingAdRock, while I agree in some circumstances with your point I think you slightly misinterpret what Above Allen was designed to be, that being something that is more analagous to 60 Thompson's rooftop bar (which has remained a members only bar since inception) rather than the Eldridge, hence why they intend to close early and remain more of a lounge where one starts their night than a club where one is more likely to end it. Those lines are blurry, granted, but if you never set out to have people buying bottles in the first place and aren't hiring promoters and the like you are inherently creating a very different sort of venue.

2009-02-25 12:56:00
I stopped by here a few weeks ago to check it out and the place was empty. The music was some sort of lounge/elevator remix, and the decor seemed very outdated and in bad choice. I had to comment on this since I can't imagine why anyone would want to go here...ever.

Gee, do you think there may be one or two of those? According to the ad: This reality show is highlighting New York City nightclubs. We want to get close and personal with major club promoters. Promoters whose one and only job is making sure the nightlife in this city is still thriving despite the current financial climate. We would like to dive deep in their world by observing their business as well as intimate and personal relationships. We smell an Emmy.

This show has been done already... about 3 years ago out in Vegas, I think it was called \"The Club\"It was decent, focusing on the sleazy owner(s), even sleazier promoters, bartenders, dj's, etc... at Ice on the strip.This of course was recently topped by \"Rehab - Party at the Hard Rock\", which aired about 8 to 10 episodes on TrueTV from Nov – Jan. It was basically like watching MTV Spring Break from Club La Vela in trashy Panama City Beach, FL.

The Eldrige lease is only $4000 or something like that, so they might not be broke, but you are crazy if think people are paying for all of the bottles you see. That said I wonder if Kamali keeps a list of potential operators for that space, like a newspaper has a obituary ready for Britney Spears or Courtney Love, just in case.

On a whim, we decided to pop into Von last night for a quick how's your father. Since we were feeling rather saucey, we decided to kick it old school with a Manhattan, knowing the bartenders at the joint always make a quality drink. We were dismayed when we were told the drink was $11, which we thought seemed more expensive than we remembered for the place. But the drink was a drink. Nice glass, great pour, strong and tasty. Now we know there are standard sizes for drinks, but in these Dow 7,000 days, big glasses of liquor helps ease everyone's pain. High praise for Von. Praise!

Allen and Delancey's wildly popular 1/2 price cocktail night has packed the restaurant two weeks in a row. But for those who plan on attending next week, may we offer you this cautionary tale from one of our (approved) commenters: I had dinner at A&D last night (Tuesday). Being I read here that drinks were 50% off, I kept them coming throughout my meal. FYI, the oysters were phenomenal but drinks are definitely NOT 50% off in the dining room. I asked the waiter and he informed me that the Tuesday drink special only applies to drinks ordered from the bar. In other words, if you want some caramelized bone marrow with your discounted Jalisco Trail, eat at the bar. A tricky ploy that seems a bit underhanded, if you ask us. But as always, the Devil is in the details. Keep your eyes on the prize and you won't get burned Little Birdies.

By all accounts, Allen and Delancey's half price cocktail nights have been a raging success. Our opening night pop in found the place packed mob deep with deal seekers, and a spot check by Eater during week two found the place \"packed from 7 - 10 for 1/2 priced drinks. Bathroom line consistently 5 deep.\" So while A&D's main game is gourmet cuisine, they have created additional revenue by cutting drink prices one night a week. What does this say about the supply and demand of booze in present day New York City? We put on our special DBTH economics hat, took the little evidence we have, and came to an overly simplistic conclusion. Drink prices are just too darn high! There is an oversupply of $12-$16 cocktails in New York City, while the worsening economy continues to exert downward pressure on the demand curve. Since fancy schmancey cocktails are most certainly an elastic good, would be purchasers are substituting cheap drinks for mixology masterpieces. Not because they want to, but because they have to. Now Allen and Delancey has discovered success by cutting its drink prices by 50% one night a week. We don't expect establishments to chop everything in half - there are still bills to pay. Cutting cocktail prices by 25% should increase the number of drinks ordered, and the increase in volume should help overcome any margin losses. This one example proves that the demand to experience New York's fine dining and drinking establishments exists, and should be a signal to operators to be mindful of the demand curve. It could be the reason that many places make it through these trying times.

I had dinner at A&D last night (Tuesday). Being I read here that drinks were 50% off, I kept them coming throughout my meal. FYI, the oysters were phenomenal but drinks are definitely NOT 50% off in the dining room. I asked the waiter and he informed me that the Tuesday drink special only applies to drinks ordered from the bar. In other words, if you want some caramelized bone marrow with your discounted Jalisco Trail, eat at the bar.

Milk and Honey's New Policies

The secret days of Milk and Honey are over. Long live Milk and Honey. A Little Birdy forwarded us M&H's updated website with a simple question, \"where the fuck is my DBTH milk & honey coverage?\" We have heard you. After the Daddy blasted Sasha's brand new number soon after it's release, Mr. Petraske has turned the game upside down. The days of the private number are over, replaced by the policy shown above. Slotted seating times from 9-10 PM, and then texting the number for availability. No show parties are charged $50, which may mean that a credit card may now be required in some cases. Funny, because they clearly say cash only, so how will that work? Expect this to be the policy until Sasha's plans to go private are finally approved. Until then, text away until you are granted access to the land of Milk & Honey.

Very sad indeed, however it's a smart move on Sasha's part. Because he changed the number every 6 months and with the advent of this terrible economic situation I can imagine that a lot of would be costumers did not have the number. Sadly having the number and being able to pull off the reservation was a fun part of the game in the past... Now any peasant in nyc can get in. Shame shame shame...

GoaG makes a scintillating expose on how the depression recession is affecting nightlife. The conclusion? Small bars are probs fine. Large clubs are probs fine. And more research is needed about mid-sized bars and clubs. [Guest of a Guest] Eater beats NYM by a few hours in glimpsing Raines Law Room, the \"speakeasy\" from the team behind nightlife institution Petite Abeille. From what we see, the hackneyed vintage-derelict chic is barely anything to write home about, but it the institution is welcome addition to the vapid Flatiron area [Eater] Tuck Shop goes all the way for beer lovers. The two owners are petitioning to import VB (a Foster's brand) all the way from Australia. And props to Grub Street for going all the way to the Sydney Times to bring us this story. [NYM]

Well, qualifying it by saying being with the right girl is necessary. Plenty of people are still turned away by the half dozen or so more fashionable venues (i.e. Rose, Bea, Goldbar, Bijoux, 1OAK, Southside, Chloe and probably a few others I am forgetting) - that having been said if a guy shows up with an important publicist and/or a particularly beautiful woman a door never has, nor should it really ever be, a problem.

Hello,I'm underage and go to NYU.I don't remember the last time I paid a cover fee or paid for a drink.I'm super hot.I'm \"friends\" with like 60 promoters on facebook.I've probably been to every \"exclusive\" venue in NYC but haven't contributed much to any one.I just jump on the promoter's comp (watered-down / not-the-named) bottle, hop over to another \"exclusive\" venue 5 minutes later to do much of the same.Promoters love me! I build their 'image.\"Too bad I slut myself to like 5 a night so they can pay off the bouncer of doorman to let me in if my ID doesn't work and let me exploit the club by acting like a parasite. Consuming alcohol and going to the next spot for more if it runs out!!LIFE IS SWEET!
KingAdRock
2009-02-17 13:39:00
this was a stupid post... Why what should be the qualifying criteria to get into a club or lounge nowadays? I dont get it... I would think all you would need is a good looking girl on your arm and have half a clue to some fashion sense. Actually thats whats wrong about NYC nightlife nowadays is that theres to much criteria to get in to a place... Places should be judged on two things.. The crowd, the music, and the capcity of the place... Thats why i stay away from these places on weekends cause they turn into shitshows and it sucks. Im sure like most people who are actually in the loop know that the best time to go to these clubs is during the week and weekends are made for dinners, lounges, bars, and movie nights. That was a dumb article.

On the contrary, Well. The \"exclusive\" clubs are ALL about commerce. Or at least they have been for the very sad past 8 years when, with a few exception. the fashionable places catered almost exclusively to moneyed clients. Now that we're all broke though, I expect some very welcome seismic shifts in New York nightlife. It MIGHT just stop sucking...
subjective
2009-02-17 14:04:00
Exclusive is subjective. Businesses are in business to make money, get over the little kid shit about feeling cool to get in. Give Binn a bag of coke and he'll open the doors. Now what? You guys are getting crazy on here. Open your own speakeasy in your apartment if you want true exclusivity.

Well Beatrice, Rose, 1oak. They will definitely be lowering their standards because of the recession.Ghost and Sandwich will continue to be exclusive because it is not about the money, more so about the history and clientele. Either way, a good time should be more about your friends and your surroundings; not about $25 cocktails and/or who is wearing what. Unless you're, well I wont judge. Anyway, see ya down by the hipster.

2009-03-09 00:05:00
dear NYU girl,if a promo is having to pay off a bouncer because you have to use an id, you're obviously only hanging out on club row where exclusivity died probably before you got that nyu acceptance letter. there are four surefire ways to tell if a club is not exclusive: 1. it id's 2. it has a cover/ comps 3. it stamps 4. if it has a fog machine. either stop partying with the tourists, or make use of that college education mommy and daddy are paying for.

Being that it was a long weekend and we were taking Monday to honor our past Presidents, we decided to head over to Broome and Mulberry to check in on Goldbar's super hopping Sunday night party. Good move, since the place got crowded around midnight and stayed crowded until closing. Even during these dark days, we still witnessed a hight volume of bottles moving out to tables. The only thing moving faster was Goldbar's doorman deluxe, Jonny Lennon, who bounced inside and out all night to ensure that everything was A OK. And what about boldfaced names, you ask? Besides DBTH et al, a Little Birdy tells us, \"I was at Gold Bar sunday night and Amanda Bynes was there - she waited at the front of the bar drinking water with her friend until 30 minutes later Matt Levine of the Elridge invited her to his table.. Also, the girl with the bangs from Superbad was outside trying to get in and talking to johnny, didnt get in!\" Bynes, Levine, and the bangs girl - does it get more boldfaced than that? Does her flack know about this?

Last night, DBTH braved the wind on the Bowery for some free-flowin' Belvedere action at the launch of Belvedere IX. We are suckers for Le Baron aka the bar at the Bowery Hotel, and it failed us not. For entertainment, a screen involving a Belvedere IX cartoon character (adorbs) flashed above the dimly-lit bar and the Belvedere folk packed the house with cool kids while Paul Sevigney spun some excellent hipster-friendly tunes. We tried all of the cocktails, including a \"deconstructed mojito\" involving cotton candy which the southerner among us likened to a mint julep; and an \"Andres Palmer\" which came in its very own bottle, ala upscale Smirnoff Ice. Specialty shots abounded with a jello shot (ah, college) and a smores shot with a huge, perfectly burnt marshmellow (ah, sleepaway camp). Our collective sweet tooth and nostalgia effectively satisfied, we left happy (and drunky).

You have it entirely right, hmmmm; corporatesuckfest wasn’t cool enough or really good looking enough to get into this awe-inspiring party sponsored by the mind-blowing new vodka, Belvedere IX (that’s “One X” to the uninitiated; please do not call it “Belvedere 9” unless you enjoy being mocked), unlike scores of boldfaced names like Samantha, Lindsay, Waris and Kristian. And, for that matter, corporatesuckfest probably wasn’t cool enough or really good looking enough to obtain admission the fabulous Patrick McMullan party the other night at 1OAK showcasing Belvedere IX, which was attended by cultural icons Patrick McMullan and Liam McMullan. These are very exclusive affairs for extremely high-end products catering to a jet-set clientele that hasn’t been affected by the economic downturn and has, if anything, been enriched by the near fifty percent decline in the price of jet fuel! We could of course just say chacun son truc and leave it at that, but it would border on injustice for us not to take our collective hats are off to legendary graffiti artist and club owner André Saraiva for really pulling out all the stops for this one, lending not only the name of his celebrated club to the enchanting affair but also its logo (as you must know, Le Baron’s logo is a traditional yet just a tad zany top hat, signifying the delightful ambivalence of privileged youth), which he has transformed into some sort of fabulous fez-esque formulation, with a Belvedere “IX” planted smack in the center. When corporatesuckfest buys Belvedere IX at his local liquor store (or, shall I say, his local “bodega,” if perchance they were to one day stock it next to his malt liquor of choice--oh what a thought!), it is my hope that he might just take note of that fez-esque image, the most refreshing logo these eyes have beheld in years, which features prominently on the Belvedere IX bottle, and that his experience of the fabulous Belvedere IX logo may bring some joy to his utterly depressing life. But if corporatesuckfest were indeed to ever purchase un boutellie de Belvedere IX, I have no doubt that a far greater pleasure—bordering on joissance—would come from his imbibing of this revolutionary spirit. How can I be certain? Well, imagine for a moment that all premium vodkas were to undergo a Centaurian metamorphosis. Belvedere IX, with its nine natural and botanical ingredients, would surely trounce all of its competitors in a polo match, scoring goals, by turns, with perfectly placed shots of guarana, ginger, ginseng, jasmine cinnamon leaf, sweet almond, eucalyptus, black cherry, and acai juice concentrate. (Heavens no, I just realized that I have undoubtedly lost corporatesuckfest with my last device. I’ll admit that it went famously awry, but I pray thee understand--twass just my feeble attempt to conjure his primitive plebian recollection of something like the Bud Bowl! Ha!).I sincerely hope that the kind souls at Belvedere IX will assuage this budding peasant uprising against Belvedere IX by posting that fantastic video of the adorable Belvedere IX animated character (the one playing above the bar) on the Belvedere IX website—toute de suite! Wait, perhaps they’ve already posted it on the Belvedere IX website! http://www.belvedereix.com/belvedere-IX-andre-videos.phpI would check back every minute until they do!

Haven't made V-day plans yet? This year, slackers have their choice of Valentine's evening locale. There are loads of restaurants still offering reservations [NewYorkology] Dubai is going bye-bye. The one-hit international hotspot is apparently going the way of the general economy and then some. Foreigners that gave the place its party rep are leaving in scores as the jobs and the money dry up..and there's no unemployment to make it better [NYT] The Plaza is thinking rather optimisitcally.

What's Up With Milk and Honey?

***CONTENT
Just what is going on at 134 Eldridge Street, the home of Sasha Petraske's New York cocktail den Milk and Honey? For months, Sasha had been promoting his plans to convert the tiny space into a members only club, mostly as a response to meddlesome websites that kept publishing the once coveted phone number. The conversion was supposed to take up to a year. In the meantime, the space had closed for the past several weeks for rennovations, during which time it once again changed the phone number. The bad news is that Urban Daddy has already published the number, saying \"For weeks, you've been wandering between watering holes, trying to fill the void of Milk & Honey's temporary shuttering. Well, your long cocktail nightmare is over. M&H is back and we've got something else you'll need: the reservations number.\" Now, there is no chance we are publishing it here, because that's not how we roll. But you can bet dollars to donuts that the number will be down by tomorrow. But does it really matter anymore? There are an insane amount of spots to get a delicious drink, so why fight over one with so few seats. Besides, Sasha himself is dishing up cocktails at White Star a few blocks away. Fighting to find a phone number to a private reservation bar is kind of Dow 14,000, no? <span style=\"font-size: 9pt; font-family: \"Georgia\",\"serif\"; color: #1f1f1f;\">

Dissapoionting move, but a smart one on Sasha's part. He has really been struggling. Although M&H will always be busy enough as well as Little Branch, the Lower East Side Company and White Star will always be struggling for costumers. The only problem with Sasha's tactics is that all of his places except Little Branch are within 5 blocks of each other...

***CONTENT
Performers Heather and Amber Langley, better known as the Porcelain Twinz, officially filed their lawsuit against the Box and owner Simon Hammerstein in New York Supreme Court. While we have heard most of the gory details before, the court papers alledge that before Hammerstein would sign as a guarantor for a rental apartment, Hammerstein called them in to his bedroom \"to talk\" - and they found him lying on the bed in his underwear, the suit says. He told them to get in to bed with him, and \"required\" them \"to remove their underwear before demanding\" oral sex from them. It was creepy just cutting and pasting that. Shudder. Anyway, the Twinz are seeking an unspecified amount in monetary damages. We are guessing about a gabillion dollars. Meanwhile, the show goes on at the Box. Twincest Slap [NYP]

So its illegal to do stuff like that? I thought that's how all people get jobs in the club world? I hire busboys based on oral skill and carafe holding abilities if you know what I mean.HOW DO YOU THINK ALL THESE WAITRESSES GET JOBS!?

2009-02-13 13:31:00
So just beacuse a guy demands oral sex that means you have to give it to him. Then you can sue. Sounds to me like there could be a lot more lawsuits in NYC. Simon is rich and these girls are trying to get some of theirs. I am sure they are very nice, wholesome girls. However, this is a bullshit case.

We suggest you stop whatever it is you are doing and dedicate a few moments to step inside the life of the one, the only, David MoFo Jaffee. Pending law school student Brittany Mendenhall sat down with the Jaff to find out what really makes him tick, and we have to say, we are now scared of him. Some choice nuggets: On why clubs hire promoters: \" If they could do it themselves why the fuck would they pay us full door or 20% of the bar? Some places are giving 40% of the bar just to bring people out. They can't do it.\" On getting paid : \"I always get paid. Fuck that. Always. I'm a little fucked up in the head and it comes down to lowest hanging fruit. A club is not going to fuck me, well maybe they would, but they're going to fuck a ton of other promoters before the fuck me because I'll put their club on email blast.\" On work: \"I freaking work like 100 hours per week...Last week I was in the office from 7pm on Wednesday until 6pm on Friday. No drugs or anything.\" On problems: \"I don't really have problems anymore because people know I'm a little crazy in the head so they handle me with kid gloves.\" It's all gold. All of it. GOLD!

There is no way that David Jaffee is opening a hedge fund you idiot, he's a pathological lier... He wont ever tell anyone who he actually works for. Additionally, for a guy who drops so many F-Bombs it's impossible that he has any worthwhile connections to start a hedge fund. He's useless, you need atleast 10 million to do that.
Hey David
2009-02-11 14:03:00
\"They look at themselves versus me and they feel dissatisfied so they have that whole cognitive dissonance thing...I made $1 million before I was 25-years-old\" Hey David - I’ve never met you, but I’m sure you’re a good guy, its probably fun to make a lot of $$ from going to clubs and you probably f hotter chicks than I do. That said, you really come off arrogant and angry in these interviews. Its not that people are jealous, its that you sound like a prick. I’ve found humility much more endearing and more profitable. Might I suggest picking up a copy of Carnegie’s How to Win Friends and Influence People”. Warren Buffett said it changed his life…

2009-02-11 14:12:00
Yeah, you're actually right, the \"Hey David\" poster - Brittany & I have known each other for a long time and I hadn't slept in ~40 fours and we had a pretty open session. lol.Ironically, when i re-read it I thought the EXACT thing that you did and texted Brittany that I was dissatisfied.Oh well, I accept responsibility for being a bit too open & colloquial. It's a learning experience.And thanks for doubting me, Mr. Money Making. lol. Lets see how things transpire. $10MM isn't a problem at all by the way, but you're incorrect - as that's way too small.Most funds are launched with about ~$200MM-$300MM in total AUM. But of course I'm sure you know more about finance than I do! Just as you're more successful & influential in nightlife than I am Mr. Anonymous Money Maker. lol.David

There is nothing wrong with being a nightclub promoter. there are a lot of hard working and highly intelligent individuals who are in nightlife. Some people do not take the traditional path and the industry suits their personalities. You can make a lot of money in the business. There are a bunch guys out there making 100-350K a year in nightlife (Maybe not this year). the problem with David is that he presents himself as this big time, high end promoter. Additionally he makes it as if he is a rich i-banker who hangs with models. That is not the case. If you are making big money on Wall Street, your emails do not begin with \"from my cubicle on Wall Street.\" Big money guys have offices. David is a very solid C-list promoter. he is the bridge between the standard crowd and the B&T crowd. He does bring bodies and some revenue. There is nothing wrong with that but, do not present yourself as something else. Additionally, he just sounds like a complete moron in this interview. he is not a stupid guy from what i know of him. He just comes off as such a loser.

He never brought a \"crowd\" so to speak....just had maybe 10 people with him....oh by the way when i say \"people\" i mean 16 year old girls with braces on from Staten Island (they told me thats where they were from) who thought they were the shit because they were sitting at table with a bottle of absolut on it. I must say, in all the years I have been doing bottle service (6 by the way )...I have never met a more annoying, egotistical, low level promoter in all my life...and I have worked with my share...One more thing....Jaffee...if you are such a big wig, how come i had to chase you down the block on several occasions to get the required minumum tip of 60 bucks!?!?!? You know what kind of people dont tip waitresses? un-classy, arrogant, broke ass LOSERS who think they are above everyone else.Girly Girl

DBTH headed down to Allen and Delancey to experience their recently announced Tuesday night special. To help attract customers, A&D were offering their delicious cocktails at a 50% discount (see receipt). Upon arrival at 9:30, we were surprised to find the front bar area completely packed, with patrons lined up 2 or 3 deep trying to get the overmatched bartenders' attention. After managing to snag some bar stools, we partook of several delicious cocktails and took in the scene. A group of bankers waltzed in around 10:30, several couples on dates, and some ladies enjoying the chicken for 2 house special. We noticed that those who could get a place to sit would stay for multiple drinks, but those who were on the periphery would drink and run. Our bartender remarked that A&D had tried to prepare for the masses by calling him at 7:00, but they were still seeing weekend like crowds on a Tuesday. Granted, the drinks were 50% off, but in these times, any way to get customers in the door is vital.

What JE has done for the industry in contrary to what Guest of a Guest likes to report is very amazing. JE undoubtedly revolutionized 27th street when he opened Suzy Wong. Before Suzy Wong 27th street was going downhill, the clientele was not nearly as good and it wasnt nearly as exclusive. Suzy Wong brought back a great crowd and exclusivity to 27th street, I thank JE for his brave actions. His business model is phenomenal although it was never given a fair shot.As for the expansion of nightlife into th garment district I was actually one of the first to promote such an idea. It makes a lot of sense on all aspects. Firstly it's an area of New York that has not been revitalized like many other areas. Secondly it's such a great location, Penn Station is right there and literally anyone from New Jersey can make a quick trip in. Additionally, it's also very accessible to all the subway lines that run down the West Side, primarily the N/R/W and L/7 Trains which would make it an easy commute from Queens and Brooklyn. I fully support JE and think that once again he could revolutionize nightlife. I spoke to JE and we are on board to spearhead this campaign. He's a maverick in an industry full of yes men, i guess I am as well :)Davidwww.davidjaffee.com

***CONTENT
Desperate times call for desperate measures, especially in the NYC nightclub bottle service game. So the Imperial has decided to turn its business model upside down in an attempt to attract some new talent into its operation. Management has introduced \"a new \"Profit Sharing\" program that benefits our immediate family of employees, and not outside promoters\", with the hope that Profit Sharing \"demonstrates our intense loyalty to employees who 'go the extra mile' in helping the Club to be an even greater success, at a time when economic incentives are even more important.\" Sounds intense. So what are they nitty gritty details? Click through to find out. How this works: 1. WAITRESSES: Will receive a 10% commission on pre booked bottle tabs (pre tax and pre tip), and will receive 100% of their 20% gratuity (no pooling with other waitresses- busboy and dishwasher portion is still payable). In addition these same waitresses will share pro-rata in the rest of the Waitress pool for that evening (walk in bottle tips, promoter tips ect). 2. BARTENDERS: Will receive a 15% commission on pre booked bottle tabs (pre tax and pre tip), and will split the 20% gratuity with the Waitress pool (10% to the bartender/10% to the Waitress pool after busboy and dishwasher payout). 3. BOTTLE HOSTS: Will receive a 10% commission on pre booked tabs (pre tax and pre tip), and 1/4th (25%) of the 20% gratuity after the busboy and dishwasher payout. 4. BOOKING WAITRESSES: Are a new category of server at The Imperial, who will enjoy the same benefits as category 1 Waitresses, except they WILL NOT SHARE in the General tip pool for the evening. We are especially encouraged about this new category because we will offer this package to ANY HIRABLE Waitress-even if she has never worked here before. We feel that this offer will eventually cultivate and develop most of our permanent Waitress staff. Very Important Conditions to Note: 1. The tabs MUST BE PRE BOOKED and given to the General Manager before the night opens. The booking must contain a first and last name. Credit Card reservations are preferred but not required. 2. Patrons that our in house staff is making reservations for CANNOT APPEAR ON A PROMOTER RESERVATION LIST. These have to be YOUR people, not the promoter's regulars. 3. The General Manager will separate two tipping pools. 1. \"The General Pool\" and 2. \"The Incentive Pool.\" Obviously this will be a blow to the David Jaffee's of the world, but will it work? Are there any waitresses out there who want to be booking tables? Is there anyone willing to actually buy a bottle at the Imperial?

I don't think this is will be enough. The only way I'd consider Imperial would be if they offered full door and 35% of net bar sales; and even that wouldn't be overly enticing cause it'd be difficult to get people to go there.Plus, it seems too bottle-focused - they need bodies. If I was Richie & Daryl I'd renegotiate cause obviously the venue is in need of incremental revenue.Paul Drohan's been good to me in the past and is a smart businessman so I'm sure he knows things that I don't, but...... my personal perspective is that this isn't enough.Davidhttp://davidjaffee.com

Why do you need to comment on something like you're some sort of genius and then put up a website link? There is a reason everyone hates you David Jaffee, your self promotion is pathetic and obnoxious. No I'm not jealous, you're just such a pompous looser and think that we all hate you of jealousy. In reality everyone dislikes you because you're so naive about how big of a looser you are. InIn reality you make NYC nightlife terrible, your crowd is terrible, trashy and of course from Jersey. Get a real life so you can actually have fun with your friends rather than hustling people off the streets all night. Also, just to show how successful you E-mail list is. You claim to have 165k contacts. Well that means that about 99.95 percent of them dont read your e-mails or show up. You bring in what, maybe 50 people in per night on a good night?

David:We have not met -- but with the frequency of your aggressive posting on this site and others, I feel like I know you for way too long. Moreover -- before you start with your typical aggressive response style -- I am not a \"promoter\" so I have no agenda in \"competing\" with you -- I'm not envious of you -- and I don't want to \"fight you\" -- as I noticed that you challenged your last negative commenter to enjoy a \"beat down\". I do however know some of the players you mentioned in your post -- and -- I'm confused. Did anyone from the Imperial ask you to take over a night, or ask for your advice?Richie and Darryl have developed Imperial's Saturday into a significant money maker and very viable party-- and the Thursday is quite strong as well. The crowd is not \"DBTH\" cool (who other than Beatrice is?) -- but it is safe and clean -- and certainly generates dollars which is something not to be taken lightly in today's market.Richie and Darryl have had real and consistent success managing \"macro level\" deals and nights many times over -- and Paul Drohan is one of the industries \"all-time greats\" in that regard, perhaps making more money in those settings than anyone (see his legendary runs at Mirage & Ohm, and the magic he worked in developing a multi-night program at Quo) For all your bluster -- please name just one \"macro\" level deal you have held down with any success for any extended period of time? It seems that you have a lot of opinions on how to run clubs -- and nights at clubs -- but, have you ever actually ran a night at a club with any success?There is a tremendous distinction between getting people to use your guest-list for a venue that people already want to go to -- and in creating a party and running a club/night for an extended period of time. Having your guest-list open, and being paid for tallies (or \"hosting\") and multiple venues per night does not qualify as running a night or venue.Until you do -- you should respectfully defer to people like Paul Drohan, Richie and Darryl who are amongst the few who have proven able to do it over extended periods of time -- and in that I mean years and \"club\" generations, not weeks.You may one day pull it off --but the fact remains that up until this point, you have not. PS -- follow your own advice and check your grammar before posting -- it makes you seem pompous & fake when you make a habit of trumpeting your education and intelligence (and attention to detail)-- but make grammatical mistakes in your opening sentence of a post. Until then, Confused......

Any place where you don't get tip out the night of is shady!... cough cough Prime comes to mind. Richie and Daryl are notorious for fucking people over on money...after paying you like shit for a few weeks and you're on the verge on quitting they pay you one acceptable week and then go back to fucking for more weeks and rinse and repeat until you realize that this people serve no value to the club what so ever. If you are working for Ritchie or Daryl you are getting middle man. Just like the movie blow get you're own little air plane and fly down to Mexico and pick up you're own shit instead of chasing Daryl around meat packing for a post dated check that will most likely bounce like a brand new handball purchased at the corner bodega. Ritchie & Daryl are good at what they do and have made a shit ton of money using their ponzi scheme macro management style. Their parties are register whore'd out and they do their sub par pay outs in cash the night of and most tom dick and sally promoter don't know any better or are illegal citizens with weird west African accents who can't checks because their illegal citizens (on top of being shitty promoters)A good staff is suppose to book tables anyway..if you need some weird point sharing incentive to motivate minor league staff...shell out a few bucks and higher some superstars!!

I like the 2 hater messages - how am I pompous merely by stating an opinion?The 2 haters, likely 1 posting under 2 names - are ignorant and.... anonymous. Again, the offer is ALWAYS open to come out and express your displeasure to my face. You won't, obviously, and either can't get into the nightclubs I work at or you're another unsuccessful promoter who's got a beef cause you can't make it in the industry; cry me a river please - I'll buy you some Vaseline and drop it off at the homeless shelter so your ass won't get so tore up the next time you prostitute yourself to purchase a hamburger.Or... better yet, work with me. You'll make more than you do now.To \"Confused\", you obviously work at and/or have a large interest in having Paul, Richie & Daryl succeed. But.... lets not BS and sugarcoat anything. Paul IS a great guy, there's NO denying it. Prior to launching \"GoGo\" and leaving Quo, he (along with Johnny Z - also an amazing person) built that party up to one of the strongest in the entire city.Richie and Daryl are both friends of mine but they're not promoters - they're \"Managers of Promoters\" and make their $ off the spread. They outsource virtually their entire nightlife operations - to either Joonbug and/or their subs.Also, lets not kid ourselves and put them on a pedestal please - cause we all know that's complete BS. Just like virtually everyone in this industry, they've had hits, and they've had misses. If you don't know that then you're uninformed and/or simply blinded by your necessity / desire to see them succeed. That being said, Daryl and Richie have also been very good to me and I wish them all the best.To reiterate, this is just an opinion, and it's unbiased also. I have ZERO to gain from Imperial being tremendously successful and ZERO to lose if it fails.I hope it's successful - and I believe it will be (successful = profitable) because of Paul Drohan.Soooo, you can say whatever you want and bullshit people like virtually everyone else does in this industry, but the location still sucks and it's still difficult to get people to go there.That being said, would you rather have a full venue that's well-managed but not considered \"hot\" or would you have an empty venue, like Bungalow 8, and not whore yourself out. I'd rather take the $$$$.But.... again, if you wanted promoters that bring out a good crowd, work at the best places and bring out the best clientele then it'd require something like full door and 35% of the bar.

Richie and Darryl are crooks. Manager of Promoters - WHAT A CROCK OF SHIT!!! That is a term that LAZY promoters who don't want to promote themselves or just can't use. They go into a venue and promise people then they call the real promoters and put all of them in a room then they collect the money from the venue 14 days later because these degenerate venue owners are taking from timmy to pay off bob and then richie and darryl have an excuse of why they can't pay you because they haven't received the check. Well here is an idea, either pay your people on time and bankroll the payments, or get the fuck out of the business, or get these degenerate venue owners to pay the night of. What the fuck is the hold up. Go over the numbers for the night and get a check or cash then and there. bunch of losers everyone. what is imperial anyway?

A surprise video from the much discussed Corner Bistro incident has emerged on YouTube, apparently showing a busboy/waiter being struck by a friend of BlackBook writer Nick Haramis. Who was in the right? It seems obvious to us, but we will let you be the judge. The lesson is obvious, respect the rules of the joint and respect each other. It's tough enough out there without the violence. [GS via Eater via BB via DBTH]

The point is... gay bashing and homophobia are serious issues. We do not need someone that takes advantage of their position to \"cry wolf\". There are serious and very dangerous people who mean to do harm to others. To have someone such as Nick report an episode of \"gay bashing\" (his words) in a public fourm with no real concrete support, is very disturbing. I would think that if Nick was \"really\" writing for the NY Times he would have never been able to print his \"episode\" b/c again, he knows he has no concrete proof. Foucus and help peope who have been attacked b/c of their sexual orientation, not on someone who was pissed off b/c he was drunk and got busted for it.

They are obviously ignoring the waiters request to get up. When people are drinking, the truth is, the get REALLY obnoxious.It shows they didn't listen. The waiter got upset. They mock the guy and sit back down, then get in his face!The best part is, the guy grabs the little waiter by his neck and the waiter knocked his ass to the ground! LOVE IT!Sorry but at that point, it dose not matter if it's gay bashing, name calling-WHATEVER! What the difference in calling someone an asshole or fag...especially if they grab you by the neck!? The waiter was to nice..I would have knocked their teeth out!THEY DESERVED IT!!!!Go Corner B!

After our So Dow 14,000 series exposed the new tipping policies at Joe's Shanghai, our friends at the NY Post dug a bit deeper and discovered at least 12 eateries have taken up the practice, illegally! According to the Posties, restaurants must declare their tip policies clearly on the menu, and failure to comply could result in fines. Keep your eyes open Birdys, and remember, DBTH has always got your back.

There are signs in the restaurant near the entrance clearly stating their policy. I don't think it's illegal.

The item does not refer to the Joe's policy as illegal, only that the Post took the story and ran with it, discovering a dozen eateries in violation.

Lucky strike autograts 20% and there is no notation of the practice on the menu. My automatic gratuity charge was actually updwards of 24% when I did the math. I brought it to the managers attention (after literally 30 minutes of waiting to see her, I went to find her), and she told me there must be a glitch in the system.Automatic gratuities totally de-incentivize wait staff from providing good service. I hate the general sense of entitlement that cocktail waitresses have... they feel that they are \"owed\" 20%. It's bullshit.I work in a nightclub and even I think its bullshit. I think it should be made illegal to automatically add a service charge on top of a tab.
APDF
2009-02-10 04:41:00
The reason a lot of service charges are added to tabs, is because in places like nightclubs and late-night eateries, you're dealing with a lot of intoxicated patrons. Patrons like these under the influence of alcohol and drugs are more likely not to tip unless it's already included. Which is why I'm a fan of the auto-18% gratuity, with the option to leave more, but not an automatic 20%...

“We suggest they also buy some generic aspirin for the next morning.”Do some research- Charles Shaw gets their wine from wineries that have excess barrels after they are done bottling any particular varietal, so its usually very decent wine, but will most likely taste different from one shipment to the next. So if you really enjoy one btl…stock up.Also….2.99 it not a recession price- the low price is what made the winery famous.

Is it ever too early to start thinking about the Hamptons? We say no! With the economic woes, ballers unloading their overpriced East End homes, and young bucks getting laid off, will this summer season poised to be a disaster? We asked a very well informed Little Birdy to fill us in on the latest and greatest in Suffolk country. LB tells us it is mostly business as usual, saying \"As always the Hamptons market is flooded with Restaurant, Bar and Club space up for seasonal rental or management opportunities…there will definitely be a game of musical chairs, but you will find the ususal suspects out there again with the exception of a few who are busy elsewhere watching their other venues burn into flame.\" Overall, LB feels \"the business in the restaurants will be as strong as prior seasons, I think you'll find a drop in revenues at nightclubs though.\" We tend to think that the kiddies will still sweat to make their summer shares happen, breaking it down at the clubs and forgoing the lavish pre-dinners. And maybe the adults will be forced to use those chef's kitchens they had to have. We shall see. <span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: \"Garamond\",\"serif\";\">

Let's face it...hanging out in the hamptons is alot better than say 22nd street when it's 93 degree's on a random saturday in July. So for 2-3 thousand bucks you can get a share and get out of the hell hole that is Manhattan for a day or two. Looking at the demographic we're not talking about folks who have kids, In laws, private school tuition to pay or those who invested with a guy named Bernie. so what have we got........for a realativity little amount of $$$ you can get yourself away from the city and on a world class beach. We have heard the doom and gloom of the hamptons every year from the intelligencia and we get it . That headline sizzles. One year the catskills were the new spot, the next the Jersey shore. Fact...less than 80 miles from times square paradise is waiting for you!Regarding the nightlife...there is always some group of bullshit artists that are goiing to change the nightlife culture....(remember Stereo by the shore, how they were going to helicopter in their \"clients\",) in the hamptons. The facts is the season is too short and the spaces are very limited that are allowed to have clubs. So the hamptons is never going to look or feel like Vegas! That's the point....it's the beach. East hampton has Lily Pond (Or whatever it will be called this year.) Southampton has Jet East (Or whatever.......you get it) and Tavern (Or whatever......) and Pink Elephant (squeezed into a space that holds about 160 people). Moving farther west we have Beach Bar, Drift Inn, Casey's & Boardy Barn and (soon to be Condo's) whithouse.These places cover the spectrum in Nightlife. If you want to stand on line and pretend you're in the city you can find a place willing to accommodate you. if you want to chill on an outdoor deck and drink shots...there is a place for that too.

The hamptons is like manhattan in that it is what you make it. You can hang out with dbag junior bankers if you want to , and you can hang out with cool people (if you know any ) -- although you're much less likely to find any of them at a nightclub.
JAMES GOLDMAN
2009-02-06 23:48:00
The hamptons is what you make it, and there is a lot of potential... On a friday or saturday night it's nice to have a change of pace and be out east... Anyone saying it's over-rated either didn't get into the nightclubs out there or stayed at the wrong share-house. If you stay at a nice house with a good group and have a good setup with a \"limo\" company to take you and your crew to the club, everyone gets in, table waiting for you... All after chilling at the pool all day playing beer pong, then continuing the festivities at night.

While we agree with Brian McDonald's statement that these downpouring bars are \"the exception and not the rule\", this item does coincide with a choice story that a Little Birdy told us last week. LB tells us \"after dinner last Friday, our large group somehow wound up in the Meatpacking District at XXXX, which was actually very crowded and very fun. I ordered two Kettle Ketel One's on the rocks, and I swear that neither of the drinks were Kettle Ketel. They were giving me crap vodka and calling it Kettle Ketel.\" Granted, our Little Birdy was a bit tipsy at the time, but we know they know their vodka. Is it possible that our finest, most high fallootin venues are trying to give us the once over? Shudder.We may need to get Seven on Your Side down here. *EN: Name of the venue withheld.

For Real
2009-02-04 10:39:00
A lot of clubs do that with comp bottles and sometimes with what they are pouring in the well. Most places won't mess with downpouring when it comes to bottles sold at the tables. Generally a waitress will break the seal in front of a client. If you are sitting at a table with a promoter drinking off his bottle, there is a good chance it is crystal palace.

2009-02-04 10:48:00
That's correct. All Promoters bottles are fake. when you go to the bar to order a drink, ask for Vodka and (whatever juice you want) you will save money. House Vodka Cranberry $10Greygoose Cranberry $14Knowing the truth. (priceless)For everything else just order the cheap shit
uncle stevie

when the disco task force enters clubs quite unannounced this is one of the first things looked at. the state liquor seal on the bottle is specific to the venue. a venue caught doing this would be in big trouble. it is even illegal to pour liquor left in one bottle to another bottle of the same brand. this is called \"marrying\". this is done constantly sometimes while a place is open and in full view. the practice of substitution is not as common as you think but is of course done. a busy place which has \"par\" or backup liquor at the bar can't get away with it. if you suspect this ask the waitress to break the seal in front of you before the pourer is put in place. if there is hesitation or excuse i think you should rethink your purchase. i think dbth should reveal the venue as they are ripping off the readers here,

Every venue in New York City does this shit. It is a real shame when they charge you $14 a drink and you don't get what you're asking for. Imagine how you would feel if you went and bought a $750 Hugo Boss Suit from Macy's and found out it was another brand of $200 value and material but just had the label on it.

liquor seals are not specific to any venue. Every bar out there marries the bottles at the start or finish of the shift. Remember the place in the hamptons ( catering to the after hours crowd) that served a table a bottle of vodka that was full of water?????? guess they wash the bottles in between service!!!!

This is ironic that this topic has come up, as I had this happen to me last month. Went out on a Friday nite to Santos the club downtown, for their hip hop nite, and ordered a Stoli cranberry drink (for $11). Took one sip, and knew it was cheap booze dumped in the bottle. I hadn't left the bar, but handed it back to the bartender, and he refused to admit that it wasn't Stoli. I even asked him to crack a new bottle for a new drink but he wouldn't do it. Obviously I was naive, but I will not go back there ever again. Take your own flasks to that club.

2009-02-04 15:29:00
Been in the game, yes it's called less frozen ice cubes. It's very common. As well as crushed ice which allows them to pour less than a standard shot and make it look as though it's a shot. It melts very quickly. Ever question why every \"open bar\" event uses this tactic....
just saying
2009-02-04 18:20:00
Drinking 1oz of vodka with melted water or drinking 1oz of vodka alone in the same time span will not make you less or more buzzed. You are still drinking the same amount of alcohol thus will be just as buzzed.

Recession people!! Recent weeks (happened twice in 2 weekends) tried ordering Ketel tonic at Merkato at the bar and they don't even bother informing you that they are out of Ketels or any top shelf vodka. ** Until early December 2008 they had top shelf liquor at their bar. ** Bartender poured well vodka into the glass and tried to sell me that which I refused to pay... Although they do have available the full bottle of Ketel to sell you at the table. Also agreed, promoter tables are just pathetic... it's always overcrowded and they serve water in those bottles.

Zagat has announced a new addition to their guides: a guide to \"dating and dumping\" in New York. $6 buys you all the info you need to selecting the right spot for your romantic rdv. And sometimes we sit in awe of the things for which people require guidance. [Zagat] Isabella's ex-crew ran one vindictive ship. Possibly in response to extortion. Regardless, there were sledgehammers and a smashed kitchen involved over the loss of the restaurant. Catfight! [Curbed] Are you sure that's Grey Goose? NYTimes has alerted us to the trend of \"downpouring,\" where some bars fill expensive brand bottles with well vodka. Which means worsening hangovers might become another effect of the recession [NYTimes] Murray Hill, of all places, is treated to a surprise guest: a luxury ($715/night) authentic Japanese guesthouse. If that's a bit steep for you, plebians can take a Tokyo-inspired staycation at one of the two restaurants serving imported delicacies such as blowfish [HotelChatter]

The History of the Jaff

***CONTENT
David Jaffee is all over the place these days. After claiming all DBTH readers to be \"fucking losers\" who \"know nothing about NYC Nightlife\", and threatening to \"come out & talk shit to my face. Obviously you won't, cause you'll get beat down\", the Jaff has taken to his own blog to establish the history of David Jaffee, nightlife extraordinaire. So just what is the story? I entered the working-world in NYC on February 23, 2004 and was happy to be a slave for 100+ hours a week as a first-year investment banking analyst. I'd nap in the bathroom to escape my superiors that treated me like recyclable garbage. I justified my miserableness by forcing my mind to believe that I was simply \"paying my dues\"; clearly I was delusional and manipulating myself. When I wasn't slaving away at the office, I'd go out to bars and talk to girls - but the conversation would usually die quickly; I thought they'd be very impressed that I was an investment banker; they weren't. I hated nightclubs because I couldn't get in; plus, I was cheap and didn't want to pay cover or purchase bottles. Can you relate to my predicament? I hope not, cause it sucked. Fast-forward to today, success is the best revenge in all facets of life and due to my workaholic tendencies. I've been able to influence NYC Night Life so that the David Jaffee of 2004 would have felt less intimidated about exclusive nightclubs. I still hate the innate superficiality and fakeness of the nightlife scene, I hate the bullshit and the egos that are sewn into the social fabric of the threads that people wear to make a \"good impression\" in hopes of meeting their \"true love\". I hate the annoying social-climbers that only talk to you because they believe you can be useful. Why not spin the fakeness and superficiality on its head? Have the Playmates and Ford / Wilhelmina Models come over to \"play\" when you don't even know their names - you're both using each other anyway. Why not maximize the expenditures of large parties so that you realize the most benefit? The Night Life world is forever filled with temptation, and many are willing to let greed and personal ego modify their character; typically the transformation is slow until it accelerates with each choice that's not regretted and sworn against. Lets try to always have the David Jaffee of 2004 that slept in the office bathroom in the back of our minds so that greed, dishonesty and arrogance are minimized; we'll make mistakes, and I'll discuss mine openly, yet hopefully we'll conquer all challenges and obstacles thrown our way. Still with us? Probably not. But at least David has been given his forum to explain who he is, and why he is so amazing.

Jaffee, no response, please do so! I'm anxious to hear from such a genius. Dear His Royal Highness The New York Nightlife Impresario, David \"Dirty Jerz\" Jaffee.I second NYCOracle. Although I am far from an industry insider and do not work in the business I still do go out often and do enjoy the great nightlife New York has to offer. As I am sure you have noticed I am one of those \"haters\" who deserves a beat down because I have anonymously posted about His Royal Highness, The New York Nightlife Impresario, David \"Dirty Jerz\" Jaffee. One of the great things about this blog is that yes, you can post anonymously (thank you DBTH). In response to your post above where you vehemently accuse the readers of this blog to be \"illiterate\" is rather ironic and undoubtedly laughable that you make such an allegation. To accuse us of being illiterate after you have professed that \"2-3 anonymous haters here to come out & talk shit to my face. Obviously you won't, cause you'll get beat down\" is again laughable. Such a terrifying statement with so much acrimonious passion only illustrates that in fact you're the illiterate one Any educated and well read person knows that the answer to any conflict or disagreement is never violence. A myriad of studies have been done on this exact issue, and all have found that fist fights and violent behaviors in almost all cases come from lower income and under educated people.To shed light on your next post where you insinuate that readers of DBTH are in fact jealous of you and wish we lived such a lifestyle as His Royal Highness, The New York Nightlife Impresario, David \"Dirty Jerz\" Jaffee, is entertaining to say the least. I honestly believe that I can truthfully vouch for just about anyone who reads on this blog that we do not envy you whatsoever, in contrary we find you to be the laughing stalk of the industry and most certainly the laughing stalk of this blog. As for going to Mexico, I'm glad you have left the country, you must be such a cosmopolitan person now. I hate to break the news but everyone has been to Mexico! His Royal Highness, The New York Nightlife Impresario, David \"Dirty Jerz\" Jaffee, I do accept an offer to meet with you in person on cordial terms where you can attempt to persuade a few of these readers that you are in fact the real deal and not a comical presence within NYC nightlife blogs.Sincerely,Money MakingP.s. Giving yourself a Dirty Sanchez does not constitute going to Mexico.

Reading that post, one can clearly understand that David doesn't really play games. This isn't an act, a \"marketing stunt\". Really, truly, he's psychotic. Its kinda sick to read. Who is this ubiquitous \"we\"?? Are \"we\" part of the David Jaffee experience? Can we all raise money and get him to go back and sit in the bathroom of 2004? Few more \"facts\" from the Oracle. - The \"investment bank\" was HSBC retail, which fired him soon after realizing the abovementioned psychosis. - He loves his MS Word thesaurus like a fat kid loves munchkins from Dunkin Donuts

This newsletter is for informational purposes only to provide general information of how we operate. * * ***Please Signup Here www.davidjaffee.com/promoters.htm to Have THE LATEST RELEVANT Information Emailed to You!*** *If you have any questions or comments oftentimes the quickest and easiest way to contact me is via TEXT MESSAGE @ 9147991796. Also, if you'd like to have your list setup at one of our parties that night, then kindly text me and I can set it up instantly. Your guests receive the same VIP treatment and door accommodations (admission charges, etc.) as mine do. Feel free to pass this along to your friends who may be interested in promoting exclusive nightclubs in Manhattan too. General & Additional Information If you’re interested in promoting nightclubs in NYC, or currently promote, then you should definitely work with us. If you're not, then there’s a high probability that you’re doing yourself a tremendous disservice. We are very influential in the NYC Nightlife scene – bringing out thousands of people every week… There’s no real secret to our success, we’re hardworkers and truly care about providing all our clients with the absolute best service and experience. In a way, we're like a Union, except with zero “dues” or “fees”; we all look after one another and share in the benefits of scale with maximum payouts and zero drama and BS. Most promoters work with us once and then choose not to work with anyone else. Remember, there’s never a need to submit a list of names / submit an RSVP list… promoting is very simple, you simply email or text us with the event that you'd like to promote and include the name of your guestlist that you want set up … we'll then credit you with a “tally” for everyone that mentions the name of your guest list. We’ll always do our best to accommodate all your people and make you look good :-) You can promote two ways: 1) Traditional Method –hosting a table and sending people to the party that you’re working and making sure that they all have a good time 1. 2) Hustling – basically talking to random people across the street and then convincing them to come to the party and then walking them in. * - Or… you can use a combination of both techniques. As long as the production is there then it makes no difference. * General Details * - You receive credit for everyone that simply informs the doorman that they're on your list. You never have to submit a list of names or an RSVP list. * - You’re welcome to promote via Myspace, Facebook, Craigslist, text messaging, phone calls, websites, flyers, business cards, etc. Use whatever methods are most effective for you. * - Compensation is available for you the following Friday or Saturday. Example, if you do parties on Friday and Saturday, then you shall receive compensation by the following Saturday evening, at the latest. * - You're encouraged to bring on as many promoters to work under you as you'd like - you get paid directly for their production and then you pay them. - The MUSIC at our parties is usually: 70% hip hop and 30% \"Other\" (dance, house, rock, pop, latin, reggae, etc.) * Compensation * * - You must bring out 10-15 people to a specific party in order to get paid. * * - We’re very fair and good when it comes to compensation * - Generally, compensation is ~$5-$6 for every person that gets in free and ~75% for everyone that pays a door admission; plus 10% - 15% of any bottles that you sell * - Example: If you bring out 30 people, ~15 “comps” and 15 “pays - at $20 each” & sell one bottle, then you will make $90 + (75% *$20 *15) + $30 = $345 in total * * - We generally do NOT ask you to pay taxes on your compensation (W9). This represents up a 40% increase in compensation over other organizations that require a W9 Dress Code / Miscellaneous Details - There is a dress code at all our events: everyone must be neatly dressed. Guys should also be well-groomed. Admission is always contingent upon the doorman’s discretion, however we will always do his absolute best to accommodate all your people and make you look good. - Virtually all our parties are from 11 p.m. - 4 a.m. - please encourage the majority of your people to arrive between 11 p.m. and midnight - You're welcome to work as hard, or as little, as you want. This is supposed to be fun and…. you will “reap what you sow”… if you work hard and do well, then you’ll make a lot of money and have a lot of fun; if you don’t work as hard, then you won’t make as much but you’ll still have tremendous fun and meet a lot of new people! - We give out bottle tickets (for complimentary bottles of alcohol) and drink tickets for every 15-25 people that a promoter brings out. We’re VERY good @ making sure that you have enough drink and bottle tickets when you're producing and doing well. * - For table reservations / birthday parties, please email me to confirm the reservation prior to providing the final “okay” to your clients. Usually, every ~6 guys must purchase 1 bottle. But… it’s much looser with girls. So… if you have a party of 30 people with 15 guys, then we can usually get everyone inside for 2 bottles. * * -- We will usually provide a complimentary 4th bottle for every 3 bottles purchased. * * --- We also typically provide a complimentary champagne bottle to large parties. *We look forward to working with you.

It is a shame that this site (which I had always enjoyed reading)) which covers NY nightlife, has had the life of a typical club. At first this site was for NY'ers and reported to NY'ers about places that they would be interested in seeing/learning more about, but just like the typical club it has sold out and has let the scum B&T ( or this david character) ruin what was once a informative website. DBTH you had a good run, I wish before you started posting and encouraging characters like david to post on here you merely shut it down like angelo for a \"private event\". instead of selling out like you did.

2009-02-03 23:40:00
Wow, that's actually TRUE, from \"the DJ\"; unless a deejay is vouched for by a friend of mine then I ALWAYS ask them to run me through what they'd spin, how they'd transition, etc. from ~12 a.m. - 1 a.m. or from 1 a.m. - 2 a.m.I've found that to be the most accurate determinant of whether I'll be satisfied because if I don't agree with their thought-process and song selection then I will likely not be happy with their performance.Obviously this particular deejay is upset because he failed to get booked; if he's frustrated with my assessment then he's welcome to seek employment elsewhere and/or to have never contacted me for work in the first place.Also, to be accurate, the \"fucking losers\" statement was in reference to those that comment yet are completely insignificant and irrelevant in the industry that they purport to know so much.Bashing me makes them feel better about themselves because they're jealous and have an inherent inferiority complex - or perhaps they hate me because I publicly exposed their dishonest, jealous, evil, shady and malicious behavior that they try so desperately to keep below the surface. Even so, i don't attack anyone publicly unless they start it - so even if i know someone's a POS I won't attack them unless they maliciously attempt to do unjust harm to me.And yeah, the haters are welcome to come out - they hide behind a computer screen using pseudonyms and spew their hatred yet I'd bet that most of them would change places with me in a heartbeat.If i was so insignificant then it wouldn't even be worth their time to make up lies and attempt to discredit me.

To ADPF,That's not the reason I started a blog. I needed a creative outlet at my day job and blogging gave me something to do while I was giving actors their audition times and locations. Also because I paid for a degree in journalism, I should use it just a little bit.I have been going to nightclubs since I was 16, working at them since I was 18 and have been attending/working prestigious events for over six years. I've interned/freelanced at many of the top PR firms and they've kept me on their lists.My blog only became \"popular\" after my article on the Eldridge was picked up by Grub Street. Before that, if you weren't my facebook friend, you didn't even know I had a blog.So shhhhh.

There are all kinds of segues from the end of dinner into alcohol consumption. A Little Birdy shares a recent experience that was news to us, saying \"the other ngiht i had some friends in from out of town, who were craving thai food. based on reviews and convenience, we went to the seemingly innocuous Planet Thailand 212 for a late dinner. at 11pm, a dj came out and shortly thereafter, during dessert, some male strippers appeared to the delight of the b&t female patrons. A hilarious grind fest if I had ever seen one.\" We prefer a nice port ourselves, but whatever floats your boat.

So many things are popping this morning, we decided to bust out an old favorite. Quick Hits! We reminded you that the Spotted Pig's annual Super Bowl Staff Party would shut the place down this weekend. Juicy details have emerged of the debaucherous evening at the Soho House, including roof top pool plunges, broken glasses, pork belly, steak, scallops and an after party at the Rusty Knot. Expect some surly servers on W. 11th Street during the afternoon shift. [Eater] Uncle Stevie is newly single and hosting/DJing a birthday party for himself tonight at Greenhouse. If you are female and under 19, he wants you there. [BB] DBTH favorite the Anchor is poised to unleash a new, more sophisticated cocktail menu later this month. Huzzah! [NYT] Have cash? Want to open a restaurant? Now may be your chance, with new listings and potential deals available by the bucketfull. But beware. Business is in the crapper and may be for many, many months. [NYT]

The article about the Anchor in the times is a complete lie. The original people who opened the anchor left a year ago and the place has been in a downward spiral ever since. I live on Spring street and used to frequent this place when amanda s, james c, and chrissie miller were still running it or owned it or whatever. I was forced to go there for a small birthday party last friday and the place was filled with wall to wall with GUIDOS. Its pathetic that they are still living off the crumbs of that chalkboard. They dont even know those people. That chalkboard is from chrissie's apartment. Those people need to give up and change the name of that place or move it off my block and up to chelsea where it belongs.

nyc promoters can suck my fat dick.... they serve no absolutely benefit to the customer... they benefit the clubs by their mass advertising where they send millions of email blasts, text messages and facebook invites, and tricking ppl into goin by makin them think theyll be vip if they say their name at the door... once again, they provide ABSOLUTELY NO BENEFIT TO THE CUSTOMER.....these so called VIP guestlists are only there to give them credit on a tally sheet for the amount of ppl they bring to a certain venue... they mean nothing at the door as for getting in, reduced admission or cuttin the line. they can make bottle reservations for you, but any fuckin person who can speak half english can do so by directly contacting the club. doin it through a promoter only gives them a cut from the amount of money you spend. promoters dont give u any discounts or such other bullshit by booking through them.honestly, anyone can be a promoter in nyc. bloc group for instance, they are such a joke. they will hire any one and anybody to be a promoter as long as they can send 10 or 15 ppl to a certain venue on a given nite. who cant do that? if you just got laid off, and arent socially retarted, become a promoter for bloc group. bloc groups business model is hire 100 stupid nightlife amateurs and if these stupid idiots can bring 5 ppl under bloc group, then bloc group bein jordan and matt can say they were responsible for bringing 500 ppl to the club. its a fuckin nightlife pyramid scheme. every now and then they send these \"exclusive\" events for ppl who sign up on their guest list, but the only ppl that dont get in to these events are ppl that say theyre with bloc group. no joke. this jaffe characters even worse. hes not even on the level of bloc group and that is just plain sad.the very very few and rare promoters that are legit are the ones who are well connected with celebrities, athletes, models or ppl with lots and lots of cash. clubs use their connection to bring these clientele to their venue bc its good for pr and business, and in return these promoters get paid and treated very well. if u happen to be a close friend of one of the very legit promoters, consider yourself lucky. so next time, u get a fb invite, email or text sayin sign up for \"douchebags VIP guestlist\"... dont do it.nyc promoters= dirtbag losersfew questions1. why would clubs allow ppl like jaffe to promote for them and represent their club name when anyone dumb enough to follow him is probably a fuckin loser themself2. how much does jaffe get paid? i sure hope a lot since he basically sacraficed his reputation to so many young new yorkers 3. aside from the massess of wanabes, who is an actual legit promoter with weight with the club while bringing in a legit and consistent crowd??

Bridge and Tunnel.. what are you crying about? What do you care if people make money promoting? Lets yell at real estate agents and say.. \"Anyone can find an apartment and tell you to rent it out\". There are are tons of promoters just like there are tons of travel agents, and tons of real estate people and tons of bartenders. Anyone can make a long island.... Lets get mad at bartenders!!!!! Promoters serve a purpose.. and they can get things done that YOU cant get done by calling the club directly...Call a club and say you have 25 people for a table.. they will say buy 5 bottles...and put your name on the list... Call a promoter and say the same thing... you will almost certainly get a free bottle if not more, and can get the bottle minimum to be taken down.... Also you will be greeted by the promoter and he will assist you with quicker entry, better table selection, and so forth. A promoter is a lot like a travel agent. They have certain abilities and discounts that you do not have as a regular joe walking up to the club. Call a hotel and it is $300 a night. Go on orbitz and its $225....If you are not on a list you will have to pay cover ( unless you are really hot)... promoters have it arranged that ladies get free admission on their list.. What is your beef? lol.. Did you have a one night stand with a promoter and he hasnt called you back and you are upset? Let it go.....

I haven't been inside Guest House in a longgggggggg time. I don't think they'd hire me to be a bathroom attendant, I'm sure I'd find a way to get in trouble if that were my position.Guess who sold the most New Year's Eve tickets of ANY promoting entity in NYC? Meee :-)Also, my email & text lists are now double-opt in so lets get the facts straight please - they're not spam. I hate annoying, BS promoters as much as you do - I just make more $$ and bang hotter girls than they do, hence why you anonymous & unemployed haters are jealous.Keep it coming :-)Alsoooo, check out my new Website that was developed by one of the foremost & knowledgeable SEO experts in the country. http://www.davidjaffee.comShit is gonna be off the hook. Oooooo, did i tell ya that i hung out with Amy Reid this past Saturday @ Mansion? Oh course i didn't cause you losers were chillen @ home with your dick in your hand beating off to her movies and I'd never ever have ya in my phone. Lol.Fucking losers. Ya'll commenters know NOTHING about nightlife & wouldn't even be able to get inside half of the clubs i do.David

Like OMG, Jaffee i hate you & you suck so much - stop telling us all these things that you've accomplished cause your success is making my inferiority complex worse & it's providing more motivation for me to makeup shit about you so that I feel better about myself.hahahaOkay, i'm gonna hit up the gym & the pool - located in my building - while ya'll continue to Google Amy Reid and beat off to her movies while telling yourself that I'm a bad person so that you can continue to live in a delusional world & believe that you're somehow superior to me.Quit being a hater & improve yourself by working hard :-) I pull at least 2 all-nighters every single week... Success is not an accident, it's earned.Laterrrr.D

Oh and name one promoter in NYC more successful than me...... you can't, cause... there aren't any.There are only about ~30 people in NYC nightlife, the entire industry, that are doing better than me - and every single one of them are owners of the ultra-exclusive venues (of which there are only ~4 of them left - Gold Bar, Tenjune, Kiss & Fly and 1Oak).Everything else, except perhaps for Rose Bar - is struggling and/or not meeting expectations.D

To answer the question about legit promoters with consistent top crowd and heavy influence (that are not club owners): koch brothers, von brock brothers, pavan, mory/joel/fontaine, isaiah, ellington, francesco, alex smith, reggie, jordan/matt/rog (bloc group guys--whether you like the rest of their business model or not--they are connected), fabian, matt g, mike/joe/ryan, bedis/tariq/clarence, francois, matt assante/dustin, eric searle, ryan v, jimmy. its these same guys that basically host all the cream places

Folks - first off you should know that unlike the jokers, the REAL David Jaffee is the one posting on this thread. Its legitSecond, everything that is being said is true. He is the biggest cock eater in NYC. He is only at Mansion because he begs and pleads to be a subpromoter. He is yet to be paid by the club for anything. Amy Reid was nowhere near Mansion/M2 on Saturday night. The crumpled picture you tore out of US Weekly and had all soggy in your pocket does not count. Also, there was no corporate account of Goldman people at Cain last weekend. Jaima has repeatedly refused to allow Jaffee to be associated with the venue. Jaffee, post just ONE jpeg of a check you have received in the last 6 months. And, Jon Gabel sells the most NYE tickets. You sold practically none. I am the Oracle, and you are full of shit.

I am in the business. I know most promoters, owners, door people, etc. I have always tried to lay off Jaffee on the posting boards because I don't really know him and always felt he had his place. After reading his posts, i can only say that Jaffee must have some mental issues. First he is not a nice kid. As his posts show he is kind of a douche. He is not in the top 50 promoters in NYC. I can only think of a handful of people that are worse. Jaffee, you make a fool of yourself by saying how successful you are. Intelligent people know that generally the biggest mouth in the room has the hardest time backing it up.

Dear so called Down By The Hipster readers and viewers,My name is Mrs. Jaffee, my lovely son David has been very upset lately about these terrible misunderstandings on this hipster blog. I think you all have him completely wrong, he's actually a terrific kid if you give him a chance. He means so much too me, he's a sweet young man. He still lives with me in the basement and takes care of me when I need him. As a mother I couldn't be happier with his moderately successful nightlife endeavors, and in my opinion it's the best thing that happened to young David. Before he became a promotional aid to all these hot nightclubs, and before he started hanging out with celebrities (Amy Reid) and being Mr. New York as he likes to refer to himself he was always around the house playing video games and some board game called dungeons and dragons with his two friends. Surely enough getting David out of the house was like trying to convert the pope to Judaism. Finally, after much convincing David saw the light of day, he ventured through the dark tunnels into New York City and realized that there is more to life than video games and Dungeons and Dragon .His promotional job has been a goddsend to me, and his success supports it, even though he lives in my basement. It was tough at first he would come home very late at night and wake me up, needless to say he's much quieter now. Now he parties every night and only plays video games during the day so that also makes me very happy. In my eyes my Davie will always be a success, he's such a cutie too with his hair slicked back and his great tough guy attitude, so start treating him nicely. I ask you all to stop upsetting my son so much and start playing a little nicer. He told me that he has revolutionized New York nightlife and that you guys are all just jealous. So be nice to Davie, it saddens him when you're not.Thank you for your understanding,Mrs. Jaffee

Dear His Royal Highness The New York Nightlife Impresario, David \"Dirty Jerz\" Jaffee.I second NYCOracle. Although I am far from an industry insider and do not work in the business I still do go out often and do enjoy the great nightlife New York has to offer. As I am sure you have noticed I am one of those \"haters\" who deserves a beat down because I have anonymously posted about His Royal Highness, The New York Nightlife Impresario, David \"Dirty Jerz\" Jaffee. One of the great things about this blog is that yes, you can post anonymously (thank you DBTH). In response to your post above where you vehemently accuse the readers of this blog to be \"illiterate\" is rather ironic and undoubtedly laughable that you make such an allegation. To accuse us of being illiterate after you have professed that \"2-3 anonymous haters here to come out & talk shit to my face. Obviously you won't, cause you'll get beat down\" is again laughable. Such a terrifying statement with so much acrimonious passion only illustrates that in fact you're the illiterate one Any educated and well read person knows that the answer to any conflict or disagreement is never violence. A myriad of studies have been done on this exact issue, and all have found that fist fights and violent behaviors in almost all cases come from lower income and under educated people.To shed light on your next post where you insinuate that readers of DBTH are in fact jealous of you and wish we lived such a lifestyle as His Royal Highness, The New York Nightlife Impresario, David \"Dirty Jerz\" Jaffee, is entertaining to say the least. I honestly believe that I can truthfully vouch for just about anyone who reads on this blog that we do not envy you whatsoever, in contrary we find you to be the laughing stalk of the industry and most certainly the laughing stalk of this blog. As for going to Mexico, I'm glad you have left the country, you must be such a cosmopolitan person now. I hate to break the news but everyone has been to Mexico! His Royal Highness, The New York Nightlife Impresario, David \"Dirty Jerz\" Jaffee, I do accept an offer to meet with you in person on cordial terms where you can attempt to persuade a few of these readers that you are in fact the real deal and not a comical presence within NYC nightlife blogs.Sincerely,Money MakingP.s. Giving yourself a Dirty Sanchez does not constitute going to Mexico.

Contrary to the rumors floating over in Slowville, Marquee is not closing. A rep for the club tells DBTH, \"Nope, not true at all. Just talked to Noah and 100% false.\" Not only is the report 100% wrong, it is impossible. You cannot transfer a cabaret license from 27th Street to 10th Avenue, anymore than you transfer air rights, a waste transfer permit or any other similar license in that manner. The license is for the specific property. Stanley the Olympian should stick to leaving nasty comments and leave the real work to Rachelle.

It seems that the ballyhoo in the media over Chloe continues. After DBTH examined the young media's infatuation with the new Lower East Side dancing den (and concurrent Beatrice Inn Backlash), Blackbook and the Observer review the review of the changing perceptions in the press. Not to be topped is Annie Fischer's Village Voice piece, laying out the full timeline of Chloe's media love. The one person who didn't get that we were talking about press coverage? You guessed it! Slowy somehow construed a discussion on the media to be a defense of an old favorite, and fluffs up her pseudo bona-fides by saying she has already compared Beatrice and Chloe to each other (a great feat of mankind), has actually been allowed inside the Beatrice Inn (we need to talk to Angelo) and that a staff photographer has taken photos at a sponsored event there (yippee!). The whole thing reeks of Pulitzer. The point? The media lifecycle of these joints is so small, and it's funny to see each outlet trying to one up each other with admiration. We love it. Chloe has had tremendous success out of the gate, and Beatrice is going to keep on keeping on. The nights are better for it.

They must have a great publicist at Chloe. I've never had a problem at the door there, even with a party of like 7 dudes. I don't know any door name either. Of the half dozen times I've visited (all have been on Mon and Tues), never has the place even been more than a quarter full . Most of these visits have been followed by a trip across town to Beatrice, which, despite being much larger, is also much more crowded. On top of still being more popular, Bea's door policy is tighter and the crowd more representative of \"downtown.\" Keep trying to convince people you rule Chloe, but for now this is pure hype.

Ray, I agree in terms of it not being a particularly difficult door during the week short of on Wednesdays. That being said, it is not all hype, it is a good venue vis a vis most of what else is out there.

The only reason there being compared to eachother even though they're two totally to different venues is that they're on the lower level of a small cramped residental building. Which ever you prefer rock with that one. If not, it's NYC there are a hundred others.

The Chloe v Beatrice hype has reached epic proportions, even infiltrating mainstream media. In response to a Village Voice article detailing the chronological history of the subject (really, we can't imagine a more worthy subject for a legitimate newspaper), Blackbook will hold a conference tomorrow at the \"neutral\" Rosebar. It will be interesting to see what all the attention will do to the previously demure Chloe. [Blackbook] Some naysayers (ehem NYTimes, SF Chronical) have proclaimed absinthe passe, already. Say what you will, but we are looking forward to the slew of newly invented or imported high-quality brands coming soon to a liquor store near you. [Serious Eats] News flash - according to a recent Pew poll, young people in their 20s like New York! Whoopee! In general, though, people were mostly ambivalent about New York, ranking it between DC and Dallas in the middle of the top 30. Though we can probably thank Sex and the City - our fair city ranked top 10 for women [NYTimes]

Our comment of the week/month/forever comes from the still scorching thread \"Mansion Is Dunzo\", i'm an ex long island jew, who went to a big state school, became a frat boy where i was a campus god, moved to the city to work a finance job my pops got me but eventually got axed due to downsizing.... im being overly stereotypical to make a point. Much more after the jump! now i hit up clubs wit my \"boys\" about 4-5 nights a week (mansion, tenjune, mr west, marquee, wherever) the fucked up thing is that i dont step in to the club and notice how ugly some of the people are or how much the crowd sucks... thats just outright negativity and who has fun when they approach the night like that. instead, i look for lovely ladies that may be interested in slight conversation and some dancing, and dont you dare say theres not a handful of attractive single ladies at EVERY club. now someone please tell me, when the FUCK DID YOU HIPSTERS GET SO PRETENTIOUS???? aren't hispters supposed to be the laid back type that looks like they just got out of bedwearing girls jeans and clothes that dont match in the slightest sense?? listen, you dirty losers from brooklyn don't exist to us clean cut, educated, banana republic business professionals..... so why the fuck is it such a big deal if were in the same venue as you fucks. this is new york city where you have people of all kinds. and then you guys go rant and rave how we ruined a venue by simply steppin in and providing business??? and how the FUCK do u know if were from long island or manhattan?? and since all you fucks are from brooklyn, ARENT YOU BRIDGE AND TUNNEL YOURSELF?? yes we grow up in long island or north jerz suburbs, go to college and move in to the city after college for work. that is the trend, nothing new and its not changing. to all the \"cool\" hipsters on this blog, take a shower, stop bitchin about ppl who work real jobs, have real lives and go on to have good families. we exist and we'll go to whatever club we like, because flat out we have more money than you. make your joke about us bankers losing our jobs and our bonuses, but dont you get it... the failure of wall st hurts all classes since the economy works on a macro level, so while we lose our bottle service, u hipsters lose ur papaya dog and have to result to food carts. steve lewis- i love ya, abbe diaz- u look like pocohantasdown with the hipsters- stop playa hatin on b&t's, we own you Do you have a comment of the week suggestion?

i liked your comment better in the beginning when you were being sardonic. then you start typing in ALL CAPS about \"hipsters are so mean to me!! and blah blah\" and i'm forced to imagine that one night you and your \"boys\" found yourself in Williamsburg (wrong tunnel perhaps?) where you headed straight into the local watering hole to \"look for lovely ladies that may be interested in slight conversation and some dancing\" (read: gang-date-raping). after the cutie with the leather boots shut you down, you went all batshit roid-rage on her, marched straight back to Staten and penned that beauty of a journalistic excrement.a bit of advice, if the point you're trying to make involves how you've been pigeon-holed your entire life for being a walking sack of guido stereotype, it may not be a good idea to then take your argument in that same direction against another group of overly-prejudged whiners. but it definitely isn't a good idea to try to legitimize your recently lost job by making some vague masturbatory gesture toward failed trickle-down Reaganomics. 'cause then your argument goes from funny to sad, real quick. also, dude, papaya dog is WAY CHEAPER than food carts.

the problem with clubs in the city is there is no longer a class distinction. everyone thinks they have money... money or lack there of is what creates separation and exclusivity. the last time NYC was a cultural center in terms of the music and the 'scenes' was the late 70's when punk, hip hop and disco were defined by a class and specific groups of people. Big clubs in the UK work because theres a fresh scene, fresh music and a concentrated group of people that care about it, not because they have oversized bottles of Patron on the walls.The only good thing about this economic downturn is that all the b & t's wont be able to afford to buy their way in, and leave NY and NYers to get our edge back, and hopefully our nightlife.

Tonight im going out, im asking some shit bag hipster where he's from, and them im smacking him in his fucking face and saying \"welcome to New York bitch\"!...I dont care how long you've been here...just because your band rehearses in trendy Williamsburgh does not make you from New York. Go out to Brownsville and have yourself a rehearsel or South Jamaica Queens with your tight jeans. If your from New York your money should be accepted as green at any club....we started this shit! You came here to experience it and commercialized and ruined it! So go back to your mormon towns and have a party in a barn!

my dear b@t ....there are plenty of spaces looking for relatively small amounts of loot and looking for silent partners. reliable operators will succeed in this market. for the price of a one bedroom condo in an ok neighborhood a b@t dude like yourself could be a hot commodity as an owner. if you kept out of the way and just watched and learned you could make money and be happy..the trick is getting in with the right folks. the really right folks dont need you so much but there are good people with good spaces needing capital.. im easy to find. as a designer i am involved with many projects at various stages and needs. many are well funded even now. some need loot,, steveoh and as far as mixing hipsters with b@t. the intolerence of the hipster by the b@t or broker crowd was a contributing factor in the rise of bottle service. the b@t guy with plastic didnt really want to hang out with actually cool people so clubs like marquee and home etc were built to service and separate these men from the cute boys. the hipsters then invented williamsburg and the dive bars which of course were invaded by the edgier frat boys and so on. the mixing of crowds is the art in clubbing. some say a lost art. today i see very few who can do it. i think i was very good at that. i was certainly not as good a businessman as those operators today, but mixing,,, i could do that.. i hope this helped...

In today's fast paced enivronment, when you want your chicken balls and soda, you don't want to have to carry two different packages. So BBQ Chicken (but not barbecue!) has created a container that allows you to hold both your drink and chicken balls. That's 50% less container, while still getting 100% of the nasty. We've seen some wacky things in our day, but this may just be the wackiest.

With traditional packaging you need two hands to eat your chicken balls- one to hold the container and one to put the food in your mouth. So where do you put your soda? Gotta set it down somewhere. The alternative is you eat like a horse out of a troph and just stuff your face into the chicken balls container.This is ingenious and it's environmentally responsible, less waste in land fills!

We have all borne witness to the spirited debate about the future of the crobar/Mansion/M2 space. According to some, the new idea that's going to save NYC nightlife and lift the venue out of the red is texclusive partnership between M2 and Ministry of Sound. As images of double-stacked Mitsubishis, sounds of Paul Oakenfold Transport and the pages of Mixmag swirl around in our head, we have to ask... for reals? This is really the business model that will bring this debt riddled operation into the black? From the press release: \"We are super excited to be partnering with Ministry of Sound to bring New York a superfluous clubbing atmosphere.\" says Mark Baker, renowned nightlife aficionado & Co-Director of the evening.\"We are combining the worlds best music with a sexy entertainment in a chic environment.\" Newsflash: Superfluous means you \"serve no useful purpose\" . Not the best adjective. World's best music? Andy Caldwell? All the big room Dj's are locked up at Pacha, Webster Hall, and the like. And if you care about the crowd, you are probably spending your nights Cielo. More analysis after the jump. MOS is like picking the scraps off the table. There have been so many better big rooms that have since come (and some gone) from London and the UK scene. Turnmills, Fabric, but to name a few. MOS has tried to pull a Pacha and roll itself out all over the world, but to very little discernable success. Brand extensions galore, but no long-term success. MOS TV. MOS Singapore got killed. A Little Birdy tells us they have \"seen MOS reps at developers conferences in Vegas for the past few trying trying to extend the brand into major US markets like Miami and Vegas, but finding no takers until now.\" So despite claims of \"creating... a whole clubbing experience,\" and an \"adult club experience geared towards a slightly more sophisticated crowd\", it's just going to be the more of the same. We certainly wish everyone success, but would think that what is needed here is some modesty, hard work and effort. Stop trying to convince people that the world would spin off its axis if M2 didn't exist, and quietly go about your business trying to make an honest buck.

While I agree that I am not anticipating a venue worth visiting I do perhaps think it a tad unfair to not expect them to promote the place as God's answer to clubbing. How else are they going to convince their target demographic to attend? Unfortunately that seems how business is done in the industry (for the most part, with the exception of a few smaller and more intimate venues. Even the owners are likely cognizant of the fact that people who go to true 'high end' venues will not be coming in the door - much moreso a matter of making the people who would otherwise go to pacha think that this venue will in fact be attracting those people. That having been said, that press release is painfully ill prepared.

The best part of this posting is \"We certainly wish everyone success.\" You don't wish anyone success because you bash everything and thats what brings the readers and comments. I think DBTH is great and often has some great nightlife information but, to pretend like you want any clubs to have success (with the exception of the few you suck up to I.E. Beatrice) is insulting to the readers.M2 / MOS will be what it is. The truth is that the city is going to shift back towards the big club because people can no longer afford the high end venues that have become so plentiful in NYC. within the next 6 months you will see massive closures of the bottle service type places. very few will survive. You can already see the increase in business at dive bars and local pubs around the city. you will see it at the bigger places as well.

FOR REAL hit it right on the head. And he's not super well known, but David Vendetta is an awesome awesome DJ with great production. I'm sure the blogmeisters at DBTH don't know that because they don't play his stuff at Beatrice, 1OAK, and shitholes devoid of musical variety that they suck up to.

Why are you so angry, negative and have to constantly bash and make cynical snide comments about pretty much everyone especially Mansion/M2 or whatever the name is those guys took a big chance to try to create something fun and entertaining the place is packed every night and from what I've heard does huge numbers financially and employs a whole bunch of people when jobs are getting scarce I am there regularly and unlike most boring boxes in Manhattan I've seen opera singers, aerialists, gospel choirs, and lots of other fun stuff you obviously have a personal beef with them and Mark Baker, who has been in the business forever, who I have seen in the business with cool places like Lotus, Life, the Double Seven etc The guy has given his life to nightlife and seems to be doing his best to create fun places for us to go toIf Lewis said Mansion will save nightlife I think you took him too literally Mansion is the only big venue in New York where you can sit and be comfortable and now they've diversified a little and are bringing in M.O.S. think what you will but every time I leave Mansion I have a good timedon't be so dark, anyone who makes an effort in this economy deserves support not your always sarcastic tone, spread the loveAND BTWsu⋅per⋅flu⋅ous   /sʊˈpɜrfluəs/ Show Spelled Pronunciation [soo-pur-floo-uhs] Show IPA Pronunciation–adjective1. being more than is sufficient or required; excessive.as a writer you should know how to use a dictionary.

the problem with clubs in the city is there is no longer a class distinction. everyone thinks they have money... money or lack there of is what creates separation and exclusivity. the last time NYC was a cultural center in terms of the music and the 'scenes' was the late 70's when punk, hip hop and disco were defined by a class and specific groups of people. Big clubs in the UK work because theres a fresh scene, fresh music and a concentrated group of people that care about it, not because they have oversized bottles of Patron on the walls. The only good thing about this economic downturn is that all the b & t's wont be able to afford to buy their way in, and leave NY and NYers to get our edge back, and hopefully our nightlife.

I am confused - are people actually trying to make the point that superfluous was in some way an appropriate word to use and in any way helped that press release? When you use the word in conversation it is most commonly associated with something needless, i.e. \"Joe wastes a ton of your time, he does a bunch of superfluous work that adds no value\". I think the definitions make this reasonably clear?

Battle Royale: Chloe vs Beatrice

DBTH
***DATE
2009-01-28 11:06:00
***CONTENT
After being an object of desire for New York's young media elite, a Beatrice Inn backlash is in full effect. The past 6 months have seen multiple outlets gang up on our little West 12th Street friend, most recently by the Observer, which takes a hatchet to the Beatrice's new and supposedly lax door policy. The Observer quotes an anonymous Model, who says \"I've seen the doorman let in Jersey trash-girls dressed in like H&M and Forever 21-sleazy guys looking to pick up underage girls, Gossip Girl wannabes, and like C-list celebrities.\" Ouch. Simultaneously, a true love fest for Chloe has erupted, with the charge being led by none other than Grub Street/NY Mag, who use every chance possible to sing its praises. The space was immediately dubbed the new Beatrice, and has a devoted and loyal following. But is the Beatrice's time on top really over? Verdict? While we welcome Chloe into the fold, it certainly has a long way to go before grabbing Bea's mantle. From Day 1, it has been annointed as the new Beatrice, but shouldn't Chloe aspire to be the first Chloe and not a knock off of another hot spot? And as one Little Birdy puts it, \"how can a place that has some random security guy running the door be any good?\" Here, here. Sure things get old, but in this game, consistency counts. A DBTH trip to Beatrice this past weekend re-affirmed that it is still making it happen and, dare we say, its new and improved smoking policy may have amped things a few degrees. And as Mr. Sevigny himself puts it, \"We don't make a ton of money, but we do pride ourselves on having one of the toughest door policies in New York City. I guarantee you we will be the last to sell out.\"

Visited Chloe for a half a minute. On busy days it's very over packed and a fire hazzard. I went there with a good friend of mines, she clusterphobic, and started have a panic attack that's how small it is. Not only that but the people there are totally corny. Just standing around looking or trying to talk over the music. The Eldridge is cooler. Everytime I've been there the vide is cool and the DJ's are great. Gold Bar is also hot, Sunday nights. La'as.

Just a quick note: CHLOE: Anything with the same name as a major fashion brand and with a VERY similar font... let me know your thoughts on that.If you like feeing like your ordering a drink in a McNally restroom and spending your nights with “I live and die for fashion” peeps that include the super overplayed geek black framed glasses look, bearded kids, parson students and fake DJ’s, then Chloe is definitely the new spot for you!On the other hand, I could see how Chloe and B are going head to head. Most of their crowds are from Middle America, or across the bridges, who came here to concur their fashion dream. Then you have a little sprinkle of some type of celeb bumping it up in some corner and a few service industry veterans roaming the scene, wondering when really bad DJ’s and the mainstream smelly hipsters became cool.

Time for our newest feature, That's So Dow 14,000, when we look back at all of the silly habits that were picked up during the boom times. Today, we look at crappy drinks. One Little Birdy has been so inpired by our latest feature, they decided to send in their own topic. Let's let LB explain. \"My friends and I stopped by the bar at Bobo on Friday night at around 11:00 to grab a quick drink at the bar. One Jack, one Jameson, one Bailey's (don't ask), all on the rocks. The bartender serves them in these nice big highball glasses, with 4 ice cubes and no booze. Then he tells us it's $36. We asked him if this was the entire drink, and he said yes, which in turn knocked his tip down 50%. The pic is the lineup of the 3 after the ice melted a bit, but the glasses were no more than 20% full of liquor. The Dow is at 8,000, bro. How about pouring some stiffies?\" We totally feel you, LB. The days of dropping double digits on a 2 oz. glass of mid-range liquor is deader than Mansion. Hey barkeeps, let's just agree that if we agree to give you $12, you agree to fill 'er up. Deal!

as a bartender i think a lot of you customers can umm realize two things. the drinks prob weren't short poured at all. yeah it's a huge glass which is why it's not gonna be filled to the top. if you want it to the top order a fucking double. and your knocking the tip down 50% for most of you cheap fucks that means umm you'll leave a dollar. also bartenders aren't making the prices. we don't choose what we charge and if you can't afford to fork over 12 dollars a cocktail then stick to your cheap dive bars with pbrs and jaeger bombs. that will much better suit you.

\"loose my bartending job\" buddy learn to spell before replying. you're on a fucking computer. use spell check. and 20 % is what i expect. i am providing a service. like it or not. if you don't wanna tip sit your cheap ass at home on your couch. but don't fucking order 40 dollars worth of drinks and be so cheap as to only tip 4 dollars. if you need it so bad keep that bullshit. obviously some of you are new to bar etiquette. and i promise anyone who comes to my bar no pours are short. but excactly what you're paying for. and if you want it filled to the top give me $24 dollars for a double. but don't then in return tip me like shit cause you just decided to pay 24 dollars for one drink.
stua
2009-01-28 12:52:00
truth be told, those are kold draft cubes. fitting them in there like that shows that is a double old-fashioned glass. probably about 11.5-12oz. it is an over-sized glass. rocks pours are always the same. about 2oz. mayble a little more. some owners like that look with large rocks in the bigger glass. there are 4.5oz rocks glasses out there where you will to the top, but most people don't like them. you get the same pour either way. i mean, who seriously expects a 10oz pour of whiskey?

Fill it up or not fill it up, if a customer says something to you about a crappy pour, then why not make them happy. To charge $12 and have someone complain about the portion size is a sign that maybe, Mr. Perfect Bartender effed up.

2009-01-28 15:26:00
because if they're not paying for it why shall i give them more??? that makes no fucking since. that's like oh i'm not happy with how much gas i'm getting for this price. will you fill me up with some more?? people would lose fucking money genius. and someone with some knowledge is completely right. those aren't even high balls or regular rocks glasses. i work with the same ice cubes and in my rocks glass i barely fit 2 to 3 because they are so large. and when i do pour anything on the rocks it still isn't nearly too the top. a rocks pour depending on owners is usually 1 and a half to 2 oz and never more. people behind desks without proper bar knowledge should shut the fuck up. goes to show why most bartenders don't believe that bullshit line that the customer is always right. honestly more often then not they are not.

Hey animal, pardon my typo. From what I can gather you're the one serving me, you're the one working behind the bar, and I'm the one tipping you. I make the decisions as to how I have been served, if you're nice 250-25% is fine, if your ok 15% is fine, if you're a dick 10% or less. Please remember that you're the one serving me essentially making you my bitch, I own you with my tips, and that's why I'm money making.

2oz. to 2.5oz. is as much as you should get. I think the glasses are just too big. I don't think they were unserved based on the picture. If you think you're getting stiffed, ask the bartender how many oz they serve for a drink on the rocks. The bartender should know. 1.5oz isn't atypically, but it's a little light in my opinion. Rocks glasses should never be filled up unless you order a double or use those tapered bottom glasses you see at standard dives.
DBTH
2009-01-28 15:58:00
Thanks everyone for commenting. Our use of the phrase \"fill er up\" was meant to be figurative rather than literal. In checking with the LB who sent in the tip, large glass or not, was stunned in the amount of booze in the glass. They also said the next glass, which was brought by the waitress, was more full. So while we understand the standard pour is 2 oz, it's always appreciated when some run off makes its way into the glass, and were in no way stating that 10 oz was a normal size drink.

2009-01-28 17:15:00
i'm the little birdy and the drink was way light. the picture doesnt do it justice. the drink was barely a 1/4 full and i said something in a nice way about maybe the bartender giving us a little more and he gave us attitude instead. we ordered a second drink for the waitress and there was at least double the amount in the second drink.hey animal you don't deserve a good tip just bc you think you do. you get a good tip if you a good bartender. and if the customer is unhappy then make him happy, its a service industry you moron. the kind of bar with dick head bartenders are the places regular patrons do not like.
Money Making
2009-01-28 21:01:00
Animal, I tip very well, all the spots I frequent regularly know this. The thing is that if you pour me a terrible drink, are a dick head or in other terms an animal and do please me then I have no reason to tip you well. Are you saying you tip waitresses 20 percent all the time? No, is the answer, and they work a hell of a lot harder than you do. Unless you're working at a cocktail bar which is highly unlikely then you're simply mixing a little jack with coke. Or I'm sure the B&T place you're working at it's more like a Hinne and Jagger Bombs!!! JAGGER BOMB

yeah i work in the les so many bnt places down there haha you're a joke buddy. and yes i tip all waitresses at least 20 percent or more. being that i'm in the biz i understand that we're all working on what the customer tips. therefore i know how much a good tip is appreciated which is why i provide good service to everyone who seemingly deserves it. i only criticized the original poster for bitching about his pour and cutting the tip in 50% like he/she said. stick to your moneymaking job and your meatpacking hang outs. i'm pretty sure most agree 20% is the industry standard. you can choose to tip whatever you like. just be cool with being in the that loser can't afford to tip properly bracket. and when you return to my bar prepared to get shit service just like i got a shit tip. only fair right?

View Larger Map One or two is normal. Three or four is something to notice. Double digits is a mofo trend. Over the past 12 months, Manhattan has been inundated with basement lounges. And while the Beatrice has been around for more than a year, and Ella and Macao are also above ground, they contribute to the new below ground movement that makes drinking at street level positively passe. As for roof bars, well, you can just forget about those. Back in the high flying days of Dow 14,000, the roof was the only place for fashionable scenesters and ballin' bankers to strut their stuff. Now, in this our winter of despair, the in-crowd has found it fashionable to crowd into these bunker like spaces, hiding from the destruction that lurks above and hoping that when they emerge, they will find better days. Fat chance.

It's another devastating blow for the restaurant space in Robert De Niro's Greenwich Hotel. First, the surprising and thorough bombing of Ago sent the restaurant crowd a twitter. News of Ago's merciful closing got the same crowd worked up over who would take over the space, and rumors of a Jean Georges Vongerichten and Jim Lahey combo quickly emerged, with many predicting it to be a done deal. Not. So. Fast. We have heard rumors that the economic downturn has not left the JGV Culinary Concepts empire unscathed, with some concepts that were gang busters here (Spice Market) do not play as well in Atlanta. And while Jean Georges restaurants in global cities like Shanghai will always draw a crowd, now is not the time to be investing your own money in a space where a project like Ago, which should have been successful, failed so miserably. That being said, Jean Georges has apparently decided to abandon any plans for the Tribeca space, with his reps telling us \"preliminary discussions took place, but no actual agreement was ever made with Jean-Georges.\" Guess it's back to the drawing board for Bobby D.

It's time for our latest feature, That's So Dow 14,000, where we fondly remember those heady days when New York City was seemingly paved with gold. Today's subject: Choosing Your Gratuity. Back in the good old days of Dow 14,000, New York City diners could choose their own gratuity to leave servers after a meal. While it was once acceptable to leave 15%, the last decade saw that rate rise to approximately 20%, and sometimes a bit more. Those days appear to be over, as Chinatown landmark Joe's Shanghai has instituded a mandatory tipping policy, making sure that all of their hard working dumpling slangers get at least a 15% tip from their customers. According to the sign, this is done \"For Your Convenience\", minimizing the chance that you think too long about cutting that gratuity down to 10%.

It's time to shed a tear for Socialista, Armin's Cuban themed lounge on the West Side Highway. According to Page Six, the club ran smack into a bevvy of smoking fines from the Health Department, and when they tried to pay, the DOH said \"Where's Giuseppe Cipriani? He's on the liquor license. He has to be here.\" Cipriani is apparently hiding out in Uruguay, hoping that the storm surrounding his tax troubles blows over. With it's slick design and star studded ownership, Socialista was a success right out of the gate. But management issues, an unfortunate Hep A scare, and isolated location knocked its legs out from underneath, making its closing just a matter of time. We know who lost, but are there any winners? The big winners in all of this are hoteliers Sean Macpherson and Eric Goode, who can now lay claim to all of the hospitality spaces in their unique little baby, the Jane Hotel. The dynamic duo never liked having to share the hospitality space with Socialista, especially since the restaurant was troubled from the get go. They can now formulate a new concept for the spaces, and once their renovations finish, hope to make the Jane Hotel another smashing success.

Well, it took a bit longer than the four months that we predicted, but not by much. Mansion is calling it quits just short of a year after opening. After dropping close to $3 million renovating the former Crobar space, the team from Florida has decided to pack it in. According to Page Six, promoter Joey Morrisey has agreed to take over the space, rebranding it M2 with plans to bring back the popular Alegria gay night and host a weekly Ministry of Sound party. That sounds like a path to success. In 1999. And after telling his readers that the Mansion team is \"a force capable of leading clubdom to a new era\", Uncle Stevie tells us that Mark Baker is beyong estatic with M2. Because declaring bankruptcy, finding new partners and trying to pump life into a dead business model is so very fun. See ya later Mansion. We'll pour one out for you.

2009-01-23 13:35:00
i certainly feel that mansion fell short but i still believe that clubdom is evolving in the right direction. mansion m2 or whatever they call it is still there and i believe the program going forward will be more in line with what i expected. the miami mentality was certainly in the way and as far as the debt .a look at the papers on this will show you that it is old crobar debt thats in question. if i was wrong about mansions greatness it was because they promised to be \"different\" they weren't that different, and when i talked to mark baker he felt that only now does he have the tools he needs to go forward. with the economy so bad it may be hard to gather steam without a solvent clientele. but bottle service and the era of non creative people running the show is dying faster than you can say lehman brothers and new spots are opening even in this downturn. mark baker is still there at m2ansion and people are going . marquee , bungalow, pink, cain and every club in the chelsea district is underperforming compared to a year ago. the second year of life was way better than the first. i think thats true with many spaces. i do think webster hall with its committment to downtown has a far greater chance of filling that billing i gave to mansion a year ago. its hard to survive in clubdom. let those who have tried judge, 3000 people will visit m2 this saturday and their votes count. and stua , if you dont like my opinions dont read them. i dont read yours very often although i did today. i;m a big fan of dbth although we sometimes disagree. i respect this blogs opinion but as we all know the name change and the loss of a partner or two in a well documented and long lasting bankruptcy proceeding doesnt mean its over. as long as mark baker is in the building there is greatness . mark baker besides being a gentleman knows as much about this biz as anyone and has always embraced creativity as his driving force. i think we will be writing about m2 for quite awhile and i congratulate them for making the moves necessary to continue doing business..

Well-written, you go girl. I agree that in this era, the bottle-service only nightclub is on the way out, and very few will survive. Clubs that can make a large-format room work will be the only ones making money in the coming year. If they can get the economics right, they stand a chance. Its a nice room, and a historic room. If they got rid of that stupid X, made a ring of tables and a dance floor in the middle, and but some solid mid-level promoters in, it would retain the Euro crowd and hopefully do well. stua, DBTH only succeeds in talking shit. In this economy, its easy to say \"I told you so\" When things start going better, they won't have anything to talk about...

Without these pioneers none of you would have anything to write about, and ultimately maybe even a job. So let's keep it positive guys and try to help not shoot anyone who's got the balls to even attempt a nightclub, Mansion was a lot of fun and let's hope those guys keep it that way.

There will be more detail to follow... stay posted.

hey, steve. let me plainly spell out what i wrote in my comment for you: you said that mansion would save nyc nightlife. i never said i don't like your opinions, but when you make objective statements and are flat out wrong, i feel that i am justified in simply pointing that out. spin it any way you want, but mansion most certainly did not save nyc nightllfe. nor will it. nor will m2. let's just call a spade a spade. and i hate to get mean, but how far down your throat is mark baker's cock? mark baker a gentleman? the one and only time i went to mansion, for the opening, that scumbag was trying fuck every single girl in my party that were all clearly there with guys. 'hi, i'm mark baker...' in that phoney fucking accent. mark baker a gentleman... give me a fucking break. i just think it reflects poorly upon blackbook to have such a self-serving writer covering nightlife. like i said, at least dbth just calls it like he sees it. he has one thing you will never have: credibility. *cough* limelight *cough* drugs *cough* prison.
uncle stevie
2009-01-23 20:56:00
first of all im proud of my past. i never dealt drugs nor was that part of the case for me. i never ratted . never pleaded guilty and never complained. i wasnt a burden to you, my friends or family and even though i was absolutely not guilty took my 9 months and made the most of it. since i left prison i believe i have lived a productive life. mark has always been a gentleman around me which has been often,. i do believe he is happily married to a wonderful woman. i think keeping mansion open in this climate has been a really hard task and i applaud anyone investing the blood sweat and tears to keep a place open, especially a big joint. its hard. i have done it. as far as predictions, ive been pretty good but nobody is perfect just as scott said they'd be out in four months . they arent. he and i were both partially right and also both very wrong. it is still mansion , its not out of business and its still trying. about 6 months ago i approached webster hall and took over the renovation of that space, it is slowly but very surely approaching a great deal of club credibility. as a music venue its amazing. i believe that a large club can lead the way because it has powerful tools , ie stages and multiple rooms. i hope that they will succeed and be the club i hoped mansion would be. i dont apologize for my column or its accuracy. its not my job its something i enjoy doing. i write everyday and i hope you sometimes find something that is interesting.. steve

Dear Loyal Spam list readers from New Jersey,It is with great difficulty that I inform you of the closing of such a fantastic party haven. Mansion was a place for all our hot Jennies and Joey's to show up in fashion with glitter and excessive mascara, while wearing the finest H&M shiny clothes wear, and for our boys from the Dirty Jerz to congregate in their tight muscle t-shirt and constantly cause a raucus, usually resulting in a fist fight over how many biddies one can slam that night. Furthermore, the excessive bottle pouring down one's throat, and hooting and hollering was a staple of any of my Mansion parties. Although I do have the great privilege of writing to you from a cubicle on Wall Street which faces a wall, I must say that my nightlife business, especially with my Jersey crowd has been very tough as of late. Stretch Limousine rides into New York City are down nearly 70 percent from some of my meticulous estimates, and the money spent by those coming through the Port Authorities well maintained Bride and Tunnels is far less than previous years. In the past my spam list readers would spend two to three weeks worth of salary in order to come in with 12 bro's and 4 bitches. They would typically spend on stretch limousines, on trying to grease the bouncers at the door and most importantly on BOTTLE'S, especially the Goose!!!! (I was given 2 bottles of Goose last night at my dance floor table, should have been there PARTY!). Needless to say, my spam list readers are no longer spending this kind of money, thus staple establishments such as Mansion are closing down. This is terrible for the nightlife industry, I am loosing venues nearly every other week. It's time for me to look at the route of promoting $1 PBR's. Anyways, I must get back to work here at my cubicle, although the nightlife industry is in shambles, I'm still doing it the Jaffee way, partying hard, getting free bottles annoying bouncers etc. It doesn't matter if I'm not racking in the cash or the Jersey ladies right now, because I have had great success with my I-Banking from Wall Street :) (Investment Advice from the Jaff: Invest in the Auto Industry and in Airline Industry)Toodles-David

steve, you're priceless. i don't care about a guessing game over how many months the club was actually open. you said it would change the face if nightlife. studio changed the face of nightlife. area, limelight, marquee, the box... these places all did something nobody else was doing and changed the way business was done. mansion never had a chance. the miami model doesn't work here and you know that. like i said, as a writer, you tend to put your own self interests first, insofar as you would rather say that something your friends are doing is going to be great, versus calling it as you see it. you're way too old to be hanging around with these kids anyway. time to hang it up.

I agree 100% with Stua. I respect you Steve, but as someone who goes out frequently and enjoys the New York Nightlife tremendously I take all your posts or recommendations with a grain of salt, or a few grains. Your biases are far too great towards your own monetary interests or towards those of your friends. It's great to have an opinion but if you're trying to hold a legitimate blog with objective views than you cannot put your own interests first. If you want to be a promoter again and push place for how \"great\" they are then join Jaffster and start spamming us, otherwise be honest, and be honest with yourself. Mansion sucked, from day 1. Ps. The Miami model? What the hell is this, its the nightclub industry. Nikki Beach is from Miami, why haven't they changed nightlife?

first of all i said it was capable of leading clubdom to a new era and that i hoped that mark and eric will have enough of it (money) to put on a great show. i think they definitely fell short but so did a great deal of things this year. they are not out of business and that is quite a lot considering the debt they started with, im not on mansions payroll. i think ive been in the place 5 times . i would have done things differently than they did. i would have embraced a larger audience. i think gays weren't invited and it was way too white for me. so mansion was not a place i hung out at. i dont write good things about any club unless i believe in it. as far as hanging it up... my business is design. i design lots of spaces in lots of places. thankfully that has allowed me the leisure of writing about clubs from a business side rather than the gossip side. unlike anyone writing about this industry im the one who has actually had some success. i will debate with anyone who wants too engage in serious discussions the merits and possibilities and viewpoints of people in the biz. as some commenter above says. its so easy to be a monday morning quarterback and to make blanket statements without background or knowledge of how things work. mansion or m2 is still standing. it is not at all living up to its capabilities but the world did change and yes i agree from day 1 they did not commit to \"new york excellence\" as i had been told they would before they opened.. i think many of their door policies and limited scope of crowd were borderline disgraceful and have been the cause of their limited success. i think if mark baker had been in full control things would have been better.since i have written my blog even back to joonbug days i have to date received zero dollars. i have written about spaces i have designed when i believe in what happens after im done . other joints i designed i have not mentioned at all. if someone can tell me how to make money doing this blog thing well..let me know. i think nightlife despite or maybe because of the recession is booming. sure its hard to make a buck but there are some great parties going on every single night and the music is amazing and i think there is a new era, i will concede that mansion didnt have very much at all in bringing it on. as far as age. well there are lots of people my age going out and working in the biz, my 21 year old girlfriend enjoys me hanging with her once in awhile and i love the dj's. the music still brings me out at night and as a designer i like to see what's working and what isnt. i assume since i keep getting hired and paid decent money to design and create spaces often by very knowledgeable people i must be something right. so as you take my writing with a grain of salt so will i take your comments. i think you made good points and i thank you for pointing out my shortcomings and i hope i will do better for you down the line ...stevep.s. i am a regular reader and commentator of dbth. i think scott is brilliant and although we dont always agree i have no beef with him at all. his viewpoint and insights have taught me a lot. i also have in the past sent tips about stories i wasnt covering because it wasnt what my blog covers.

Uncle Stevie,Let's be real here. The megaclubs are terrible, no one enjoys them, they are so unpersonalized, too many people can get in and the door policies are horrendous. Additionally, let's face it, a place that's called Mansion is going to be a failure from day one, especially with the history of of the location. A place that needs to pack at least 2000 people per night to be a success is complete joke. How do you expect to run a business that way with the staff and high expenses of ny rents. Not happening.

obviously thousands of people are paying scarce money to visit the mega clubs on fridays and saturdays. webster hall did 2000 people last thursday. some people like big dj's on big sound systems. the argument that they go to these places because no one else will have them is dead wrong. first of all there are plenty of small venues with worse crowds. secondly if you took even by your visual or style orientated point of view the top 500 people of any of the big joints that would be , even by most standards , a pretty hot crowd, the people at many of these clubs thumb their noses at the crowds at the \"lounges\" like 1oak and or marquee. they consider these venues musically ignorant and irrelevant. cielo is the only \"smallish\" place on their radar. there lies the new era idea that i believe in. the clubs that i was involved in back when were all both socially relevant like the bungalow\"s , 1 oaks and kiss and fly's but also featured world class dj\"s and held concerts where large acts that cost large amounts of loot could perform and generate revenue. the bill of goods i was sold and to which mark baker still adheres too is that mansion can combine all of these things into that room. he says it could happen now without some of the \"entanglements\" shed this week. mark is a pro and he's is still trying. i myself am way less confident in his ability to achieve these goals . obstacles like the recession and the demise of the west chelsea club scene make it tough. without sounding too much like im supporting a club i designed. i went to webster for a sold out concert this week, i attended the gbh party there on friday and visited resident dj cassidy on saturday and the place was slamming each night. sure its months away from meeting their targets but i think they have the potential to be the shit. the band line up is hot the music great and the guy who designed the place is a genius !...stevep.s. i just might sign that petition to get rid of me over at bb and just write in comments here. no editors, back and forth dialogue. this is way more fun.

Steve,I hope you understand that a place like Webster Hall, Mansion etc will never be attractive to any crowd but a very trashy and B&T crowd. Webster Hall, good god, yes it might be decent concert venue, however in terms of being a club it's a place I would pay to stay away from. Are they still doing the wet T-Shirt competitions lol. I guess if you want to mingle with guys in tight muscle T's with their bros from Jersey and enjoy going to Panama City for spring break then you belong in places like Mansion, Marquee and Webster Hall etc. Furthermore, how can you defend any place that makes you go through metal detectors. That just proves what kind of crowd they get, none of the smaller clubs in the city make you do this. Additionally, your statement that 1Oak and Marquee are \"lounges\" is completely absurd. Marquee is the farthest thing from a lounge and it's almost impossible to even compare it to 1Oak which might have capacity for 400 people, while Marquee has capacity for 3,000. Have you been to 1Oak, or is that a little too exclusive for your likings!?

it's so simple. regardless of this economy, people are still going to go out. they may not drop $$$ like there were at some places where you could spend $10k a night, but there are so many places that were around before and will be around after.what does mansion have to offer? you're going to bring in some big name dj's? great. cool people still aren't going to go to a place with fat girls on bungee cords doing a poor excuse for 'acrobatics' above their heads. or girls in those elevator tubes. it's a carbon copy of francois frossard's design for set in miami and that s why it was doomed. it's just cheesy. it's what people like in miami. bring in whoever you want- won't make a difference. m2 will be doa.pacha has been bring big dj's and bringing a big crowd for years. cielo has been super-consistent, too. these venues offer a value added: they bring entertainment that has a following and people actually go to hear the music and see the dj's. they don't care about bringing the cool people. b&t people don't care about great music, so you get a crowd of enthusiasts and very little trash.there was never any value added to the bottle service places. it was see-and-be-seen. they will fade when people start to consider not so much how much they are spending, but what they are getting for it.webster hall is too big for great crowds. and again, steve, you're involved with the place so as far as i'm concerned, your opinion about it should be thrown out the window. it will never happen.it's as simple as good parties and places that people want to be. that's why santo's has done so well. so many different parties, no pretension and even draft beer at a club... imagine that! hipsters, bottle service regulars, gay, straight, models, live music. love it or hate it, it is one of the most eclectic things out there.just keep it real.

Few interesting points...Money Maker - Marquee holds 3000 people? Seriously...what rock do you live under? 3000? Uncle Stevie - I think its honorable that you put your opinion out there. Truest point you said is that everyone likes to monday morning qb about everything because that's very easy. Going out there and working hard to create a concept is the tough part, and if people weren't ballsy and took risks we'd have nowhere to go. I'm sure sometimes you succeed and sometimes you fail, but you continue working, thats the nature of business. Most nightlife people are crazy anyway. On a craziness scale of 1 to PM, you seem to have it pretty well together..best of luck (I'm sure you'll get the scale if you think about it long enough)M2 - Was there briefly this weekend. Seemed to be pretty darn full, crowd was mixed from good looking folks to trashy B&T. I'm sure its a work in progress. Not joking - David Jaffee was there too...outside, trying to get in. I think if M2 wants to turn around the image, they should probably not be hiring DJ Theo (from Neptunes) who is a flag bearer for B&T, and go after some higher end DJ's. Bob Sinclar played there last year and it was a great show with a great crowd. I think the key to making M2 survive is getting the European crowd involved. Go after the Pacha model (not the stinking pile of shit uptown, the REAL Pachas in Ibiza and around Europe). There is a magic to a big club done right, from the early days of Mansion Miami, Rubyskye San Francisco, Ice (was) Tao (is) in Vegas, and NYC should have one high-end big place. Its sad when places like Kiev or Reykjavik has better large clubs that New York City. Webster - also stands a chance. When they book great live acts is great. When they book DJ's is so-so. Crowd is young but it always has been. The more Chromeo and Justice shows they book, the better, every dj in this city seems to be stuck playing Mark Morrison and Britney shit instead of real music.

Uncle Steve, Marquee is far from a lounge, Bijoux, Bungalow8, RDV Sub Mercer, these are lounges. Marquee is merely a dance club that attracts a trashy crowd. Not a lounge buddy...

-I do not believe that a person can make an accurate judgment on the style / appearance of the crowd that attends Mansion unless you have seen with your own eyes all 2000+ people weekly for several consecutive weekends inside the venue. -The crowd in \"sky box\", \"owners box\", and most center VIP tables is different then the rest of the venue. Many of the same promoters / hosts who bring \"working models\" / attractive women to Tenjune, Kiss & Fly, and Pink Elephant actually work At Mansion on a weekly basis and bring out some of the same girls. Mansion is the only venue of its size that still attracts \"high-end\" promoters. I am pretty sure there are at least 300-400 people weekly inside that could easily attend \"high-end\" venues. its a matter of taste / mood which type of venue you would like to attend. I personally enjoy the great energy at Cielo, Pink Elephant, and Mansion, that is the reason why I attend those venues. its not a good idea to just make ignorant judgments based on attending a venue once or twice.-I will remain anonymous, but I can easily state that if Mansion was on the brink of going \"Dunzo\" then they would have been shorting promoter checks and not offering competitive salaries. Mansion had issues in the past (June - July 2008) with promoter pay outs but have been completely on point ever since. Most small lounges cannot afford to hire several \"high-end' hosts and pay them $300 salaries for 20 ladies each.-I do not think the bottle-service scene is going to die out, its still very much alive. Many of the center tables in Mansion are $1,500 - $2,500. Mansion which has about 100+ tables sells out pretty much every \"normal weather\" Saturday. Also understand it is January, the weather is very cold (one of the worst months in the year for the club scene) The fact that Mansion packs out, and is still able to reject at least 10-20% of incoming traffic to the club, shows that its still a giant and its business model is still working.I also think that many of the statements that were written by others including myself are susceptible to bias. Its only human to be biased.Steve Lewis I love your blog, and so do many others in the industry, you wrote many interesting articles. I think Webster Hall has potential, I do not think its better then Mansion, but I think if the right moves are made in the next couple of months we can have another giant in New York. Re branding Webster hall was a smart move, but I still think it has a bad image that will be in the way of making it efficient until more large teams jump on, in combination with better public relations + special events.

thank you eugene. if webster hall gets a chance to continue on its curreny path it will be real real good as they are so solid musically and i think its the best room in the city with a caberet. kelly cutrone is the pr and they are adding promo for a around fashion week push. i have high hopesmoney making .. again i designed marquee and understand what it is. i used \"lounge\" in quotes as it was meant to be from the viewpoint of those who attend mega clubs like webster or pacha.unemployed ...since you have time on your hands come to webster on friday night for the trash/gbh party and tell me its not hipster..although the term is sometimes used only to describe a too cool for school crowd that lives out in brooklyn, i think this party which had a real solid. hot crowd of 2000 peeps last week will impress even you. ill list you in case you and a pal might want to check it out. since your unemployed you might enjoy the free fun.as far a sjoey morrisey is concerned , he has for many years along with artie generated huge amounts of cash with a large filler crowd an enough high end. news that the alegria party and ministry of sound are landing there adds to the cach.. joeys crowd will aloow enough cash flow to do wonderful things. it will be interesting if m2 management uses this loot to improve on your critisisms steve

Hey Eugene, I hope you're enjoying the traffic in New Jersey right now. It's completely absurd, any place that uses a lot of promoters is completely useless, that's point number 1. Point number 2, the fact that you're clearly a promoter is pathetic. Promoters are the scum of NYC nightlife (unless you have ownership in the venue). Please stop defending Mansion it's terrible, and there is a reason that it's going out of business. The mere fact that you clearly like Pink Elephant, Cielo and Mansion is very entertaining. Stop promoting, it's a terrible job, a trashy job, and restricts you from working at any of the high end places, or any of the good places. In turn your nightlife judgment is completely messed up. In order to experience the real nightlife scene leave your hair gel and muscle t at home, go out to some of the nicer smaller venues and see what it's really about. Way better crowd, way hotter girls and a much much better scene. As for Uncle Stevie and Webster Hall, complete flop, it's too far past it's prime and no one will want to go other than those from Jersey, Staten and LI. The only time hipsters will ever go there is if some random obscure small town band from Iowa is playing, after all isn't that what hipsters do?

Hey Money making... Why are you such a hater? Seriously, what is your objective by saying all this negative crap? What is the point of a club? To make money i presume, not to have it full of hipsters. Take a nice club fill it with hipsters, and then what? Watch them be too cool to buy a drink? Great idea... that place will last....Places that make money are a combination of trendy crowd, bottle service, (yes BOTTLE SERVICE).... and good management. Believe it or not most places, when they open, dont know how successful they will be. Success is not easy to predict or even measure at times. But some people take it upon themselves to take a chance and open a club, or renovate WH and make it new, to see how it goes. You dont have that kind of money, most dont, if you do open up your own club, then watch it flop and then come on here and see 15 people bashing you. I dont care one way or another, just seems you are bitter about nightlife and want everyone to fail. Get a hobby.

2009-01-27 13:32:00
Can't say I've been in the business for as long as most of you gentlemen posting here but if I was running a nightlife business I'd certainly make some changes.I believe there need to be cover charges for women.Women should stop getting freebies.Women should be able to hold their own.Shot of goose at college bars is what - $5-$8? A chick can't afford that cover fee?Every day I keep hearing from ladies, and I quote, \"my cheapest nights are club nights. I don't pay for anything.\"A girlfriend of mine was at greenhouse last night. No cover fee. Free drinks from a promoter's table.What shit is this. At least have her pay the damned cover fee. Imagine... all the money to be made if a girl on guestlist would pay at least $5.Relatively good looking women went, and still go to Webster Hall. They complain(ed) about paying the $30 cover fee, but they did pay it. Maybe that's why Webster Hall has been open for so long, and has undergone a facelift now to live on its legacy. People still bought drinks.Bottle service will live on. Purchasers and their party could have the cover fee lifted.The only people getting in free should be celebrities, signed models, REAL friends, and promoters.\"hot\" sorostitutes should be paying. They come for an experience, the club experience. They can get liquor with their fake IDs from bars or liquor stores. NO reason why they can't pay a little to contribute toward all the entertainment the club experience provides - lights, sound, etc., and bottle purchasers (who buy the bottles to attract women).That's my $.02.

The problem with making girls pay, is that they will then blacklist that club from their to do list. So unless every operator is on board with this it won't work.
Stan
2009-01-27 13:54:00
yes, I mean to say.Everyone needs to get on board for this.That one or two small lounges that won't charge (1oak or so), they still have a capacity limit and a reputation. Not everyone will try to go there, or if they do, fall back and end up paying.A large venue should NEVER, in my personal opinion, let girls in free.
APDF
2009-01-27 20:03:00
The idea behind letting girls in for free is to make the guys want to pay up in order to be surrounded by girls. If a table buyer knows girls are getting in for free it means more girls are going to go which makes it a more attractive venue for a person in that position. If everyone is paying to get in, it makes it look like a less trendy venue, more or less of a \"concert hall\" as you will.

hey abbe! actually i dont disagree much. i just dont think peter had much vision at all, no eye patch joke necessary, his abilities to hire people with vision and allow them their freedom to create was his strong point. alig myself jeffrey jah and a very few others created the cool and brought the people and peter kept the business running super well and funded. people often asked me how i could talk to the man. i always answered he was one of the few who actually got it. his fall from grace which took me and quite a few others along should not discount his daring and abilities. the unfortunate thing about the whole mess as these clubs will always be enveloped in scandal which clouds their greatness. to many drugs were the reason people came but i think it was the programming and performance of the staff at least for the good years. drugs unfortunately became an important player and we all know how that played out.

hey steve-lewis!yah yah drugs shmugs. what-- Spy didn't have drugs? Bungalow never had drugs? Beatrice doesn't have drugs? clubs have drugs because that's where the market is. the laws of supply & demand will never change, no matter how many giulianis roll through office.[and call me crazy, but if anything, the \"scandal\" only added MORE mystique to peter's legacy. peoples love that shit, it's what movies are made of.]i totally understand what you're saying, of course i was nowheres near the creative end of it, but if you say others aside from peter-gatien were responsible-- okay i hear you.but it still does take a very daring visionary to fork over massive amounts of cash to other peoples and say \"go ahead and run with it. even though you have very little-to-no experience and don't come from some fancy shmancy bigwig PR-hyped-up architectural firm.\" the desire for him to even want to create such a thing of artistry in the first place and give the creatives an outlet for their expression is deeply admirable, is alls i'm sayin.not to mention the \"vision\" of evolving from place to place. limelight was as different from palladium as it was different from tunnel as was different from USA (which, i'm sorry-- blew them ALL out of the water, the Studios and Undergrounds and even MKs included).i suppose these days the real estate and the boards and the SLA is what hampers this kind of creativity now.but-- this new crop of kids with the obnoxious pretentiousness and the lame-assed decor and the attatoody doormen and stupid fucking bottle service and the plain ole rampant idiocycertainly isn't helping.

By all accounts, Soho House New York has been a smashing success. New York's media and arts elite clammored for a coveted membership, members from London made sure to spend a bit of time in its cozy Meatpacking confines while in New York, and companies loved to throw glitzy bashes there. Win, win, win for everyone. But in these downtimes, when many people are looking to cut costs whenever possible, are SHNYC members thinking about bailing on the annual dues? And who will want to replace them? One Little Birdy who is not a member tells DBTH that they have been approached by a few members, offering a membership at a \"discounted price\". While this does not spell doom, it is a troubling sign at a time when the company is focused on a global expansion. What say you, DBTHers? Are you ready to cancel your membership? Are you ready to sign up if given the chance? Comments are open! [Photo Credit]

Members can't \"offer\" memberships, so that doesn't make any sense. They do offer a reduced rate for younger people, so that may be what the tipster heard, but that has always been the deal with the junior membership and it doesn't offer all of advantages of the grown-up membership.

Your little birdy and Page Six Magazine seem to be looking at this from different angles.

I agree that times are tough, but everytime I have been to Soho House its still pretty busy. I do know that they have instated an Under 27 Membership that is a price more attainable for there younger members but I dont think its a \"discount\". Members dont have the power to offer memberships to one another or non mmembers for that matter either....I think that little birdy might be a tad confused or just upset he has been on the waitlist for so long.

A pair of new spaces are opened for business. Sort of. First up is Above Allen, a members only space at the Thompson LES hotel has soft opened. Cards will be mailed out to select members sometime in early March, and come summer, Above Allen will pull back its retractable roof to let guests enjoy the fresh air. A quick hop and jump away is the still not opened Woodson and Ford, which Urban Daddy says is \"destined to become the next great underground scene, now open (sort of) in Noho.\" We aren't sure about that, but we are positive that the Wood is still not open to the public and they do have a $14,000 piano in the center of the bar.

i have to say, Brittany's opinions on EVERYTHING (venues, decor, events, promoters, etc) mimic exactly those of my 19 year old cousin who just transferred to NYU from Ohio State. My reactions to said opinions fall somewhere between \"aw isn't that cute\" and \"this kid has absolutely no idea about anything and she needs at least 6 months in the city before I introduce her to anyone I know.\" Rachelle might be slightly dorky, but at least she's done her research.

My name is Brittany Mendenhall and you guys need a new hobby.I wasn't even aware Rachelle put me in that article until I read it a few days ago.I blog because I love to write but don't feel like having a 9-whatever job at a magazine or newspaper. But when owners are emailing me to come to their venue and cover their anniversaries/openings/drink menus, I must be doing something right.I couldn't sound like your little cousin because I was born and raised in New York. I've promoted and/or worked at almost every single \"hip\" club from 14th street to 29th street.I remember when the Lotus backroom was THE SPOT, celebrities still did coke at Bungalow 8 and EVERYONE, famous or not, pieced together the night at Flourent. Hell, I've even been to Sound Factory.The only point you have is the Blackbook interview. I HATE that interview. But Steve Lewis (who is a very very good friend of mine) said it's a good interview and I trust him. But it definitely makes me sound like the LC of the east coast and it's not something I'm particularly proud of. I know better for next time.And by the way I have nothing against skinny white boys. My boyfriend is one!But I'm done writing because my roommate is out of the bathroom and the shower is now available.XOXO (God I love that show)Brittany

Realizing she didn't exactly make the cut (let's be honest here), why not make a blog, promote it, and use that as a tool to sneak past the velvet ropes.

On the Circuit: Scenes From Sundance 2009

Glitz, glamour & DBTH. What a winning combination. As usual, DBTH was on the scene to check out opening weekend when most of the magic happens. Here's a quick recap. With the pending inauguration in D.C., Park City was front loaded to get the main events over with during the opening weekend. Most of the \"talent\" had departed by Monday to head east, and we are guessing many of them were forced to share a Gulfstream or, gasp, fly mersh. Pity. Friday evening found us at the 'Brooklyn's Finest' premiere party thrown by Greenhouse at Sky Lodge and presented by 360 Vodka. The movie stars Ethan Hawke and Wesley Snipes, but we also spotted Kevin Bacon, which makes us only 2 degrees removed from Bernie Madoff. Something we can always cherish. Saturday night is right this way. Saturday night in Park City led us to the Tao Lounge at the Sundance Lift for the 'Spread' after party, starring Ashton Kutcher. Sir Ashton graced us with an appearance with Demi Moore, making out knees tremble with glee. Heh. Also making the kids go ga ga were Sting, Anthony Keidis, Slash and Woody Harrelson. As always, the Tao Lounge was a zoo, with swarms of people pleading with the door people that they of course were on the list. Newsflash - you aren't. Once inside, the Lounge was crowded but in a jovial way, with a crowd there to truly appreciate the art of cinema and Sir Ashton, a true thespian and gift to the craft. Sunday night brought us to the best party of the weekend, the Vice/Elite event at the new Downstairs. Word to the wise. If you are going to throw an event out here, get a damn modeling agency to co-host. It makes a difference. The Randolph Wrecking Crew whipped up copious amounts of their Progress Punch, Perry Farrell Scribble provided the music and P. Swayze came by to show he is still making it happen. Oh yeah, Vice had a movie or something in Sundance at some point.

Peace Keeper
2009-01-24 23:31:00
What makes Mr. Snipes a bum? What is an Obama (Mr. President) tax rebate? Does people paying taxes make you happy? How much in taxes does all the delinquent taxpayers owe? Have their been any other actors, athletes, teachers, cigarette manufacturers, hotdog vendors, construction companies, lawn maintenance companies, hooter girls, doctors or judges that you feel need to have their ledgers reviewed for taxation legitimacy? Or are you like most people, you just want to see a historically flawed legal system, perfected? I hope you want wrongs righted. That way I would be happy knowing that someone else in the world wants fairness, justice, and equality granted to all without excessive partiality. However, if you practice peace, it is hard to have hate in your heart. And all you witness, shall be painted with the same colorful brush of tolerance and civility.

You were leaving and offered your two stools to me and my female friend. You said she needed a foot massage. Anyway, you said you were an interior decorator and I mentioned that I was looking for someone who could help with my apt. You called my number but I erased it by mistake. Maybe you'll get this. A post dinner foot massage? This is the group you pursue on MC? To each his reach. We hope you lovers find each other in time for Lover's Day.

Breaking news over the wire. Ben Leventhal, co-founder of Eater, Editorial Director of the Curbed empire, and frequent nemesis of DBTH, has ankled the company will be going back to the laptop. Mr. Leventhal announced his departure new role tonight in a post on Eater, saying \"I'm surrendering my position of Editorial Director of Curbed. This is going to help us stabilize the bottom line in a meaningful way during a difficult time.\" While we have certainly had our issues with Mr. Leventhal over the years, we wish him the best. Fortunately for all of you, we are well positioned in this down market and aren't going anywhere anytime soon. UPDATE: It seems that Mr. Leventhal has transitioned from the front office back to blogging, taking over as day to day editor of Eater LA. We wish him luck and reccomend the Pastrami Swiss Burger at Pinks and the sandwiches at Bay Cities Deli in Santa Monica. [LA Times] From the Editor's Desk [Eater] [Photo Credit]

Before we go for the long weekend, we now bring you our comment of the week. Dear DBTH,From my cubicle on wall street I report that all my earnings will be up for this quarter. Yes, I am a genius I-Banker, and for fun instead of going out with my friends and buying bottles (because I'm such a successful I-Banker) I spend my nights hustling people to buy bottles in the hopes that the B&T club I'm promoting for will give me a table on the dance floor and a free bottle! This is what I call going out the Jaffee way!! If you want to be added to my mass text messaging please check out my website. In the meanwhile, I will be trying to get within 20 feet of the doorman at Plumm to find out the real story, and hopefully I will be able to report the true story with diligence from my cubicle on Wall Street tomorrow morning. Kind Regards,David Jaffee PLEASE CHECK OUT MY WEBSITE! And dont forget to buy hair gel if you're coming out with me. Noel Ashman Moving On? [DBTH]

The former Westward Ho Hotel was redone by LA based Commune and features The Amigo Room that is designed as an old ranch hand bar, and King's Highway restaurant which is really just a transformed Denny's! We could not confirm if Moon Over My Hammy is on the new menu, but our fingers are crossed. Ace Palm Springs will open in February, and could be a popular place in May when Coachella rolls back into Indio. In Ace NYC news, the hotel opening has been pushed back into early March 2009. $99 bunk beds. Get pumped. Ace Hotel Coverage [DBTH]

Ellas sucks and I am sure you would says its great because the door is a joke. My 18 yr old sister home from college was there a few weeks ago. A joke I tell you... Its always smart to start with a few cocktails at Whitestar or ES Company then head to Casanis for a dry martini and cap the night with a giration fest downstairs! get your mind right people! Its sad though that the LES/Chinatown has been getting so much publicity latelyI know it will soon be overrun with even more faux hipsters spouting estoric BS!

everybody needs to get a fucking clue-hipsters, nyc fashionista wannabes and DBTH losers, .. first of all, corner bistro is an institution!!!! its feeds off of its amazing concept and burgers nonetheless, but who really gives a flying fuck that it feeds people that cant get into shit rundown late night coke den around the corner, which clearly it doesnt need! Corner BISTRo is for legit NEW YORKERS and not for hipsters trying to fit in! Get some REAL material before posting info that nobody really cares about!!! tired of reading stupid blogs tht has been appealing to B&T.. THANK YOU!!!

So (Old Man) since youve been around, in, and on top of the game since 82'... currently own a successful place of your own.. why dont you fund a a club, get some of your investor pals together, we'll run, manage, and promote it.. have some succes, make some money, and then run it into the ground for you. Hows that sound to you? Lets talk details...

2009-01-17 14:06:00
WOW!! Whom do I write my check out to? I started going to clubs in 82' not owning them. I'm old but not THAT old. BTW...that's exactly what's wrong with todays nightlife, the owners, investors, and promoters really don't care about longevity anymore. All guys like you (assuming from your post that you have something to do with nightlife) want to do is open big, make shitloads of quick cash and then crash and burn. My club ran for 10 years and my resaurant so far since 2001', I'm all about the long run. P.S. I am looking for a new venture but I prefer smaller \"lounge\" oriented spaces. But hey.....thanks for the offer!

Regarding a this week's hullabaloo over the Webster Hall Door policy, a commenter sheds some light on the situation, saying: a simple call to the hispanic doorman in charge of decisions shed light on the situation. it wasn't color that kept them out. .it was the offending remark one of the 4 girls said to the other in spanish. she obviously didn't know the doorman could understand what she was saying. he politely told her not to bother and the bitch went nuts. the race card is easy to play but a lot of the crowd who got in were non-white and whites were turned away as well. they are trying to make it nice there and obviously don't need drama from these type of foul mouthed low class people. she knows what she said and it's worse than the shit she made up. While we don't appreciate the foul language, we do appreciate the tip. Let this be a lesson to all of you, respect your doorman and don't underestimate people.

The folks from the Randolph have teamed up with those crazy mamma jammas from Vice to dominate the upcoming Sundance Film Festival in Park City. The reason? Besides wanted to teach those industry nerds a thing or two about how it's done, Vice is releasing its first feature film, \"White Lightin\", and Team Randolph will be handling the events surrounding the film at Downstairs. The details are as follows: The Sunday evening (1/18) event will run from 12am-5am and will be sponsored by Vice Magazine and co-hosted by Elite Models. During the day on Monday (1/19), we will be running a 'hub' for Vice where snippets of their film will be looped and press junkits will take place. On Monday evening, The Randolph and Vice will co-sponsor a cocktail hour from 7:30pm-10pm which will act as a prescreening event for Vice's first feature film, \"White Lightin'\". The Randolph will then host an after-party from 1am to 5am featuring DJ Paul Oakenfold. The whole Randolph wrecking crew will be in Park City to staff the fiesta. Beyond events, the Ranolph will be serving up Progress Punch, a special event cocktail, to all those A-Listers and Hollywood wanna be's. Full recipe after the jump. Progress Punch 3/4 simple syrup 3/4 lemon juice 1 oz Orange Juice 2 oz Makers Mark Served on the rocks 1 dash each Fee brothers Peach and Rhubarb bitters (on top) If you are in Utah for the festie, make sure you swing by to say hello. If the clipboard mafia gives you any static at the door, tell them DBTH sent you.

The Webster Hall Boycott

Does the recently re-opened Webster Hall have racist door policies? The new Facebook group Boycott Webster Hall claims it does, saying: me and a group of friends (mostly females) and I go to Webster Hall for a night of drinking and dancing. When we got to the front of the line the bouncer tells us that we're not going to be let in [before getting carded or even spoken to]. We move to the side, and the group of Caucasian people behind us are let in (btw i dont want this to be a race war). We notice that every group of black and/or Hispanic people are not let into the club. From what we saw, a Hispanic couple, a group of black men as well as a group of black and Hispanic women were not let in. We caught this on tape and it will be released as soon as it's edited together. A group of Hispanic males were not let into the club before we went in.This is ridiculous, I understand that someone may want to keep the place safe so they don't allow a group of 'thugs' in. But this was every minority. Our friend, who was white [who seemed to be gettin closer to being let in] but spoke spanish was not let in. Yet our asian friend, was allowed in. They were right next to eachother. Webster Hall is Racist. but worst of all were the Black bouncers explaining why and defending such blatant racism. We also overheard one of the white men at the entrance say \"They're too dark...\" Several Black & hispanic clubgoers left upset, and completely aware of the racial discrimination being exhibited by this establishment But is it true? A FB commenter claims it is not, saying \"Thursday January 8, 2009 I went to webster hall with a group of minority female friends and we all got in with no problem.\" We would hate to think that Webster Hall is blatantly rejecting people based on the color of their skin, and that this was an isolated incident. The group does now have 145 members, so it seems many people have had a negative experience at the East Village institution.

You have to put things into perspective. A nightclub survives by having a certain type of crowd. If your demand is high you can be selective and let in the type of crowd you wish to have in a club. Some clubs will let it a type of crowd that others wont. 5 girls walk right in, 5 guys from Jersey have to get 2 bottles. Is that sexist? You bet your ass it is, but it is justified if you understand the biz. If you had a choice between 5 hot girls and 5 mediocre girls, who would you chose to let in? Take a look at the type of crowds at the clubs where you hear about shootings and stabbings. Mostly minorities. (Not a racist statement, its just a fact). ie: PlaxicoIt is a private establishment and they have to protect their interests. When you work as security and 85% of the fights that break out are of a certain demographic, you may be inclined to be selective with that given demographic as a door policy. It is not racist it is common sense. If you hear of violence constantly in a certain neighborhood wouldnt you try to avoid it if possible?The most successful nightclubs all seem to have a similar type of crowd. That is not a coincidence. That crowd typically will not consist of many minorities, maybe some, but not many, if it works financially, makes sense to follow the trend. just saying

I'll have to disagree with \"just saying\". A lot do happen at clubs that are not targeted to minorities. How about kidnappings? drug busts? fights in front of the clubs? fights inside of the clubs? And they just happen to be, guess what??? WHITE PEOPLE! I really doubt a group of females will come out and start a shoot-out regardless of their race. Your comment is really offensive. It's sad that nowadays in 2009 that we have to deal with racism. Our elected president will be the first black president! Matter fact, if he ever stepped up with his black relatives at WH, will he be denied? He is really bi-racial and most african-americans have some type of white in them and other mixtures. And hispanics are made out of different races. This is plain ignorant. I'm sure whoever thought of the idea of being discriminatory thought this was making their party \"upscale\". NOT! racist.

One question that hasn't been asked is if these individuals that were not let in were just not dressed right or look right. It's pretty easy to write a story about how you weren't let in and the establishment is racist. I have never been to Webster Hall, new or old so, i do not know. However the demographic that clubs discriminate against most is ugly people (based on the doorman's opinion). That is a fact. The truth is, this group of people might not have been that attractive.

Just sayin,I am a male who has been going to bars and clubs for over 10 years. I have gone to places where the room was all white and fights would still break out. A couple of them involved flying bottles and chairs. And I have seen many great clubs get raided or shut down because a few white people were caught selling drugs. If those \"successful clubs\" were free of violence, why is the Meatpacking district overflowing with cops on the weekends?You need to get a book called \"Clublife\" that was written by Rob the Bouncer. In it, he says the biggest troublemakers in the nightlife industry are ...... guidos. And I am not a fan of that word, which should give away my ethnic background.And one more point.... At its high point in the late 90's, Webster Hall was always a mixed crowd......

Cool. People are still posting things under my name. Thanks for giving me additional press.We're doing Marquee, Pink Elephant and Cain Luxe this weekend.Also, I have no problem with anyone using my guestlist - in fact, i encourage it. From personal experience, i don't think it's Kenny Kenny - he's one of the top doormen in NYC. Plus, he has experience with people's hatred from when he was a child growing up in Ireland.I've never been to WH though so I don't know if this article is accurate but... yeah, I'd like everyone to use my guestlist - and that includes Blacks, Hispanics, Whites, Asians, etc.As long as people are well-dressed and neat then it's all good :)Good to be back in NYC after spending a week in Mexico :)David

Door policies are not conducted by skin color, and anyone who still thinks that doesn't go out enough. If you've convinced yourself that that's the reason you or someone you know isn't getting into a given club you're wrong.The way you dress, carry yourself, and the group you come with will determine entry into any club. The smaller \"it lounges\" as I call them will be stricter requiring a name drop and such, but with that and the aforementioned you will be fine.The people claiming this racism don't fit the profile of what the club is looking for, for that given night, and race is not the issue, besides that it's a private venue which may include and exclude who it deems admissible.

I live 2 blocks away so i see the crowds at that shithole at all hours- pre and post. The people in question must have looked like some serious lowlives considering the people i have seen walking around. I didnt think it was even possible to get rejected from that place. The crowd appears to be very mixed so it is not racism...classism?- most certainly.
ohplease
2009-01-13 18:28:00
WH has a puerto rican, a cross dresser, and king at the door....racist? two door people arent even white...they are trying to make the crowd look better in there. most of the problems in clubs are between these upper east side white fake drug dealers anyway who decide to look tough beating up some poor little jewish nerd for credibility....my experience is its the white kids who fight...especially the low level dealer ones...remember being a low level dealer Steve Lewis. Those are the kids to look out for.

a simple call to the hispanic doorman in charge of decisions shed light on the situation. it wasn't color that kept them out. .it was the offending remark one of the 4 girls said to the other in spanish. she obviously didn't know the doorman could understand what she was saying. he politely told her not to bother and the bitch went nuts. the race card is easy to play but a lot of the crowd who got in were non-white and whites were turned away as well. they are trying to make it nice there and obviously don't need drama from these type of foul mouthed low class people. she knows what she said and it's worse than the shit she made up.
What?

What did she say?
little ol me
2009-01-13 21:25:00
as few have mentioned so far, i've been to some of the top most \"exculsive\" clubs all around the country and 99% of the time it's white people fighting, doing coke in the bathroom, white girls stealing purses, etc.(witnessed it more than once) That's not the point though. Doormen have the right to use their discretion as they see fit, so this was probably a rowdy group anyway. Besides, it's WH, I didn't even know they deny ppl. Haven't been there in years though so idk. I will say this though, I went to Cafe Deuville (sp?) once and this douchebag doorman gave myself and a female friend (both black) a hard time, but told my white friend that if we weren't there it wouldn't have been a problem. The promoter that we knew came out to get us but after that little remark we said nah f it. Also, once at Arena the doorman charged me cover :gasp: but comped my boy and the two girls we were with (who happened to be black) so who knows. It's just funny to experience these things as those same ppl are wearing dunks and fitteds while Biggie is blasting from the inside. Soooo it's okay to rape black culture but not let them in our establishments? Oh except when they're throwing 2 g's down to buy bottles, that's right. i'm definitely a very well dressed, good looking guy with money so who knows why doorman do what they do. I feel that it should just be the knuckleheads against the good ppl. don't let in the obvious trash and it'll be fine. oh well what do i know? if a club doesn't want to let me in on the strength of my skin color their loss...at least that's what my mom told me ;-)

white people everywhere
2009-01-14 09:59:00
this is impossible because white people do not go to webster hall. let me rephrase that, white people that act like white people who are over 21 do not go to webster hall. we stopped going when i was 19 because i felt too old for the place.
Club Veteran
2009-01-14 12:07:00
If 99 percent of fights and drugs are caused by white people, then it would make more sense to bar white people from the clubs??If its still 19+ at the door or you can get in simply by pulling out a credit card, it's not a tough door......

There is something very special about a snowy winter day in New York City. We spent ours in the snug and toasty confines of the Spotted Pig, sipping on their delicious Bloody Mary's and enjoying some homemade mulled wine, which is served warm and chock full of spices with a touch of honey to bring it all together. A lovely way to watch the snow falling in the West Village.

Steve Lewis sends word that the Meatpacking District has still not run out of space for pretentious nightlife spaces. No more luxury hotels with swank lobby bars or former meat markets converted into trendy clubs. The future is below ground. It seems there is a new space under development below Ninth Avenue that is co-owned by Steve Hanson featuring \"12-foot+ ceilings and actual street manhole covers as part of the ceiling\". Access is through Ara. While Lewis did not notice any ongoing construction, the space had previously been marketed to nightlife's heavy hitters. Paging Noel Ashman. A New Space Under the Street [BB]

Remember Fall, 2007? The housing market was booming, ballers were buying bottles, and anyone lacking an on call Gulfstream couldn't really be considered anyone. At the same time, the Dow Jones Industrial Index reached 14,000 for the first time. Life was good! Well, those times have come and gone. Unfortunately, some aspects of those heady days are still with us. Allow us to introduce our latest feature, That's So Dow 14,000TM, where we expose ridiculous things that seemed to make sense for a moment, and are now simply ridiculous. Firmly entrenched as #12 on InStyle's List of New York Hot Spots is DBTH favorite, The Eldridge. You know the drill by now, as the \"bartenders are called butlers, security guards are called chaperones and where hospitality consultants accommodate every request.\" But did you know that ladies are strongly discouraged from wearing flats? This dress policy, over-hyped low quality champagne and over priced cocktails are all So Dow 14,000. Funny enough, the DJA really started to tank when the Eldridge opened in late summer 2008. Coincidence? You tell us.

2009-01-12 12:23:00
It's an odd list -- the point seems to be variety rather than exclusivity. Obviously any \"best\" list would have 1 Oak instead of Tenjune and would have included Beatrice. I guess \"idiot\" is one of those people that gets his scoop on what's cool from Us Weekly? The Eldridge, as a concept, still has to be the most silly ever, (you can get a pizza delivered there, talk about full service !), and its owners regularly humilitate themselves on middle-market Guest of a Guest, Andre' from Beatrice collaborates on Purple Magazine and rolls with Karl Lagerfeld. You don't have to like the place (I don't) but the scenes and people are not vaguely comparable except that they both serve drinks.
comparison
2009-01-12 12:50:00
in all honesty, eldridge and beatrice are two different scenes, i've been to both, beatrice is much more hipster and younger-very cool, but in a grunge kind of way, and eldridge is classier, more sophisticated in a way, but has its hipster elements, if you were to compare them i think that's the best way to describe them, they are both small, beatrice being bigger, but eldridge has more of a vibe, being that it is just 1 room, as far as comparing celebrities from what \"teabiscuit\" wrote, beatrice has its mary kate's, and lindsay lohan's, and eldridge has its donald trump, richard branson, halley berry's, john legends - they attract completely different celebrities, one place has young hipster celebrities, and the other has its elder celebrities, both places has its model filler, to each its own, but to compare the two, they both have different agendas
so dont read the site
2009-01-12 14:54:00
classier? really? you fucking idiot. kate moss and keira knightly are not going to the fucking loser eldridge. but they are regulars at beatrice. Purple Magazine is not hosting their fashion week party there and no self respecting fashion editor or designer is hanging out at this poser spot. hey idiot why dont you go hang out at some lame bottle service club or move back to scarsdale. keep your feeble thoughts to yourself comparison - you don't know shit about shit.

Why does Plumm get such a bum rap? According to one Little Birdy, it may have something to do with owner Noel Ashman selling out his interest in the club. Our LB says: rumor is that noel ashman does not care about his biz is because he sold 40% of his club \"Plumm\". He is gonna closed soon and reopen with another name and new staff. Thats why he is having so many getto parties and not paying his staff. Also Damian Dash is gona be invoved in it. We think Damian's momma may have an issue with that arrangement! As for closing, Noel Ashman's reps firmly deny the story, telling DBTH: Story not true! In fact, Noel and his business team are looking to open another space in NYC as well as versions of The Plumm in Atlantic City and Las Vegas. The A.C. rumors have been floated for a long time with nothing to show for it. The Plumm in Vegas?! Color us dubious over that story line, with our Vegas Guru telling us \"no credible ny club owners want to be in vegas now. too expensive to open and the industry is in the doldrums.\" As for the Plumm, negative rumors have been swiriling around the space for months, and similar clubs turn over all the time in New York. The most important thing is the location and valid liquor license, and long term operators like Noel always seem to find cash to get things done. No word if Ethan Browne and Heather Hunter are going to be part of the new operations. [Photo Credit]

Dear DBTH,From my cubicle on wall street I report that all my earnings will be up for this quarter. Yes, I am a genius I-Banker, and for fun instead of going out with my friends and buying bottles (because I'm such a successful I-Banker) I spend my nights hustling people to buy bottles in the hopes that the B&T club I'm promoting for will give me a table on the dance floor and a free bottle! This is what I call going out the Jaffee way!! If you want to be added to my mass text messaging please check out my website. In the meanwhile, I will be trying to get within 20 feet of the doorman at Plumm to find out the real story, and hopefully I will be able to report the true story with diligence from my cubicle on Wall Street tomorrow morning. Kind Regards,David JaffeePLEASE CHECK OUT MY WEBSITE! And dont forget to buy hair gel if you're coming out with me.

I love it when Noel comes on this website and uses names like \"the truth\", \"happy worker\", etc....You might want to wait a little longer than 3-5 minutes to make posts it makes them a tiny bit more believable.Noel Ashman is a THIEF. He owes a lot of money to a lot of people. He's lost several claims cases already. Anyone who still works there or goes there is a fool.The best is when he DJs, and I use that term loosely. Its amazing how quick he can empty his own club when he starts playing music.DBTH: Please stop wasting time with stories about this loser and his sad club.

Are you all torn up over the closing of the Knitting Factory on Leonard Street? Now that both it and the Wetlands are long gone, do you want to fill the gaping hole in Tribeca's music loving heart? Great news! You can take over the Knitting Factory lease and have your own 3 story nightclub. YAY! YAY! We're going to get a nightclub! YAY! Here are the particulars: 6,000 SF Ground Floor 1,000 SF Mezzanine 6,000 SF Lower Level 4,000 SF Sub-Basement Spread out over the 3 levels, that's 17,000 feet of space. It also comes pre-approved with 3 cabaret licenses, meaning your customers won't just have to stand like statues through the night. We are sure they will appreciate that. Now here's the rub . . . The owner is asking $40 PSF with a 5% annual increase, meaning your going to have like $1 trillion dollars a month in fixed costs. Oh, and your neighbors won't like you and the music business is a disaster. But, did we mention it's a 3 story venue with a history worth it's weight in gold? We did? Oh. If you are interested, you can contact Don Steven Kamali, the grand poo bah of hospitality real estate.

Let us take a moment to explore the world of celebrity chefs. Rocco Dispirito catches a lot of flack for a variety of reasons. Some of it is deserving, some of it not so much. But according to Whitney Casey, the one thing that Rocco should never catch flack for is his, um, penis. The Match.com columnist, author and former TV personality told Howard Stern that: Rocco Dispirito was the best lay she ever had. She also claims that he had a perfect penis. Howard asked what that means. Whitney said that he looks like the statue David. Howard said that statue has a small dick. She said that he's a good looking dude from head to toe and his penis was like a Viagra version of the statue of David. That's definitely TMI for a person who is cooking our food, or at least used to. Now we know why Rocco is in no hurry to open another restaurant.

What happens when a weekly gossip magazine files a report on clubs and bars that may turn a blind eye to the City smoking ban? A Little Birdy files this report: i was at the beatrice inn a week or so ago (the friday after christmas actually) and no one, literally NO ONE, was smoking. it'd been a month or two since i had been in, so i scouted out a sufficiently hirsute, skinny-jeans-wearing fellow to ask about it. he said they'd changed the policy and smoking was now off limits. i found it hard to believe but his waify lady friend nodded sadly in agreement. any other news on this? did i just hit an off night? one of the joys of that place has always been its 'den of iniquity' atmosphere. would hate to see that go. Smart move LB, seeking out the fanciest fellow in the skinniest jeans to get an answer, but like the old adage says - \"Never trust a fellow in pants an 11 year old couldn't squeeze into\". As you can see from the photograph taken in early 2008, smoking has never been allowed at the Beatrice Inn. That's what \"No Smoking\" means. For the many nights we have spent there, we never witnessed anyone in violation of these rules, and will personally vouch for the owners and management's vigilant enforcement policies.

Beatrice is the most overrated place in Manhattan, it's a joke. I have not been there in a little while, because it's a pretty lame crowd. But I would imagine all the hipsters in their pretty tight jeans and big glasses are still puffing up regardless of what the \"rules\" are. Additionally, you can smoke in just about any club in the city, especially when things get going.

While it's true that all good things must come to an end, saying goodbye is oh so hard. So when we strolled across the now shuttered Knitting Factory, we paused for a moment to reflect on all of the down and dirty fun that both DBTH and so many other funsters have had during its mighty run. The Knit is moving across the river to hipper and cheaper pastures, while the founding owner is pursuing more adult hobbies. Somehow, the new Knitting Factory just won't be the same as 74 Leonard Street. But that's OK. We will get through this together.

Those crafty cocktail devils at Freemans are at it again. A recent once over of the winter cocktail menu revealed a new drink named the New York Trading Company, made with Applejack (the season's most popular spirit), lime juice, and Velvet Falernum. That last one made us scratch our heads, so we cued up the DBTH research staff to find out more about this mystery ingredient. So is this stuff really made of velvet . . .? Velvet Falernum was invented by the cocktail master Dale DeGroff to be used in rum based drinks, and is a sugar cane based liquor who's taste \"comes from a refined infusion of lime laced with fine cane syrup and botanicals, including almonds and cloves\". Oh so fancy. It is the first time we have come across a NYC menu that uses this ingredient, and believe we will be scheduling a trip down Freemans Alley to sample one or six of them.

Want to know just how cold blooded 1OAK's Binn really is? A Little Birdy tells us: I went to 1OAK with six hot girls on Saturday night. The girls had two other girl meet them outside. Binn let me and my group in right away, but he wouldn't let the two other girls in, probably because they weren't as attractive. Apparently they were really upset, but since I didn't know them, I went inside. Oooh, that's cold blooded. Binn certainly is a barbarian. But we guess that's why they pay him the big bucks.

The room has no ambiance at all, its like standing around in a lobby. Music usually sucks, drinks are super expensive and poorly mixed, and Richie is a midget that doesn't get any respect anyway.

They make more money then most of you. Its a very tough job not because its so hard to decide who should come in and who should be left out. Its a tough job because most people are rude and even when a doorman says no in a nice way, most people want to argue why not rather then leave.

Obviously \"aaalex julien\" is not Alex from Tenjune, Nor is \"Binn\" spending time on this forum posting...But most importantly, NONE OF YOU [CYBER THUGS] HAVE THE FUCKEN BALLS TO SAY THESE THINGS TO THEIR FACES. Chances are, you're not getting let in because 1)you are indeed a fat, ugly drunken slut or 2)you're a herby dude who has no sense of style or dough in your wallet so you have Nothing To Contribute to the venue. (So, if you happen to be lucky and slipp past the ropes, you still won't feel welcomed by the rest of the crowd cuz you simply don't fit in w/ the vibe). When one is going out, take the time to dress like a respectable human being, 'check your egos at the door' and maybe have a little bit of patience.

\"I honestly cant even understand why there is so many comments on this topic.January 8, 2009 at 05:51PM | Unregistered CommenterSomeone wrting something\"Clearly whoever wrote the above post has the IQ and grammar skills of a person whose purpose in life is to open doors for me. Must be Binn or Aalex who can not understand why they are being hated on so much. Maybe if you guys did not have such attitude and made the whole nightlife experience a little less stressful on your clientele who are essentially providing you your job then you would be liked and respected a little more. Your job is merely to make sure that an attractive and high spending crowd enters your establishment. In New York it's not a very hard to find such clientele.Amen.

SB3, the sexy restaurant with the sexy cocktail list that brought sexy back to the corner of 3rd and B, is closed for renovations. After a strong start, the operation had become something of a shit show. The renovations will hopefully fix whatever ails the space, but we can only hope that whatever gets fixed, they don't touch the sexy. Whatever you do, please don't renovate the sexy. Additional photos after the jump.

Hopefully it's a big enough renovation that I can convince myself to go back there for their unlimited crabs. We had the worst brunch I've ever had in my life there; every single thing was both wrong and bad (even the water). Haven't gone back since and have told people looking at the menu as I walk by not to go in.

We have found the lemons on sale at Whole Foods for $2.99/lb (~3 lemons), and have been using the sweeter, less acidic citrus fruit in a variety of drinks. Our favorite is a homemade recipe we are calling the Meyer Swizzle. Recipe is after the jump. Meyer Swizzle 1/2 Meyer Lemon 3/4 oz. Simple Syrup 2 oz. Tequila Muddle the lemon in a shaker. Add the simple syrup and tequila and shake very well. Serve over rocks. Rinse and repeat!

Has a price floor for Jager shots been set? At both Bull McCabe's and Ryan's Irish Pub, shots of the dark brown go for a clean $3 a piece. While a bit more pricey than Continental's 5 for $10, it is nice that you can take these down one at a time. So if your neighborhood bar tries to charge you more than $3, here is your visual proof that they are ripping you off. DBTH - always on your side.

Welcome to 2009 everyone! In case you slept through the weekend, here's what you missed. A writer who already hated absinthe goes deep into the absinthe revival and shockingly discovers that she still hates absinthe, comparing the fad to \"ear piercing for men, tattoos on women, those cigar bars, pole-dancing-aerobics classes, mind erasers, blogging about one's bikini grooming, naming one's bong after a cartoon character.\" Her various tastings conjured thoughts of mouthwash and licorice, helping to reinforce her pre-conceived notions of absinthe as being overrated. It seems silly to seek out a trend that's not a trend just to bash it. Why not just not order absinthe? [NYT] Been dying to know more about the most powerful doormen in New York City? Why not read this fascinating and expertly written expose that tells you (almost) everything you could ever want to know about Wass, Binn, Jonny Lennon, Angelo and Frans. [P6 Mag] Free drinks and how to find bars serving free drinks! [NYT] Britain rang in the New Year their own special way - by getting blitzkrieg drunk and placing 999 calls every 7 seconds, which is the \"second highest volume of calls since the Millennium\".

Despite the hullabaloo caused by the SLA's new rules for receiving a New Years Eve operating permit, plenty of establishments managed to get their applications submitted and approved in time. As of December 30 at 4:00, 221 Manhattan bars were granted All Night Permits, and an additional 43 in Brooklyn. This means that everyone who wants to drink until 6 AM will have ample choices of location, including the Eldridge, which is still selling tickets despite the owner's declaration that all guests have to be approved by management. Way to be on top of your business. We have also determined why so many Strong Islanders make their way to Manhattan to ring in the New Year. Nassau County only has six bars with All Night Permits, not nearly enough space for all of that hair and attitude to let loose. The shame. The shame. All Night Permits List [PDF]

We are officially winding down 2008 here at DBTH HQ. And what a year it was. There was that thing, and that guy over there, and that place that did that stuff that was so crazy. Do you remember? Of course you do. How could you forget? As we prepare to welcome 2009 into our lives, we wistfully look back on 2008, and remember The Year That Was: Story Of The Year - The recession and its pending impact on the nightlife and hospitality sector. Cancelled projects, fleeing investors, cut rate hotel room prices and pending taxes on drinks and alcohol are all a result of the credit crunch. Its impacts are unfolding behind the scenes now. Venue of the Year - Santos Party House. Andrew W.K. and crew spent a good amount of time making sure their everyman dance hall was perfect, and they have seem to hit on every level. DBTH Favorite Bar - The Rusty Knot. Go ahead and bring the hate, but free tunes, great food and Tecate with salt and lime juice on the rim always pleases our soul. Now that the buzz is gone, the Knot is a great place to hang. Best Cocktail Lounge - Apotheke cast away the pre-conceived notion of what a cocktail bar is, and created a unique vibe in which a science lab meets Sprockets to serve up the most unique drinks in the City. DBTH Favorite Cocktail(s) -Too many to name, but we loved taking down many Smoky Rob Roy's and Bee's Kisses at Freemans, Back Forty's at the Back Forty, and a shout out to the refreshing Gin Jam at Double Crown. DBTH Favorite Cocktail #2 - Jameson on the rocks. Nuff said. George Bush Award - Given to to the things we just want to see go away. The winner is, of course, Matt Levine and the Eldridge, which managed to make all of us simultaneously laugh on the outside and cry on the inside when reading his many, many interviews. We want to ignore it, but there is simply too much to cover. Trend of the Year - Subterranean lounges. What to Watch For in 2009: The Ace Hotel - New York. The City has not seen a project like this in a long time, and we eagerly anticipate seeing the impact this has on both the area and industry. 2008 MVP - Down By The Hipster. Who did you expect? We would also like to thank all of our readers, Little Birdies, media friends, media frenemies, and everyone else that helps make DBTH tick. For those of you keeping track, we are a full 22 months into this thing of ours. It's been a great ride and we expect the hits to keep on coming deep into 2009. They said it would never last, but they couldn't know that we were too crazy to stop. Happy New Year everyone. Humbly, DBTH

Christmas Week marks the annual migration of New York nightlife characters to South Beach for the busiest nightclub week of the year. The last 12 months has brought a lot of change to Miami, some good and some not so good. DBTH traveled down Miami way to investigte the new, the bold and the beautiful in Miami: The Fontainbleu: If you haven't seen the billboards for the new Fontainbleu, it's safe to say you have been living under a rock. They are everywhere. The billion dollar plus reno of the resort that Bond made famous opened to the public a short while ago. Not wanting to be swayed by a PR driven opening event, we held off visiting the space until now. Almost all of the resort is now open, barring Hakkasan. The verdict? Not impressed. For the amount of money pumped into this place, the results are more Vegas than Miami, with an abundance of cheese. Velveeta to be exact. To make matters worse, the restaurants and nightlife spaces were a bit lacking. The buildouts look cheap and the crowds were terrible. Particularly disappointing was the Miami Marketing Group-run nightclub Liv. It was massive and still felt like an old theater rather than a brand new nightclub. Tiesto was packed on Saturday, but come on... it's Tiesto in Miami. It could be in the middle of Overtown and people would go. The Fontainblei is simply too big to fail, but that sure as heck don't mean it's a success either. Oh, there's more. The Mondrian: Doesn't South Beach need another Morgan's hotel like it needs more dudes with sequins on their shirts? After we spent some time there, the answer is a resounding YES. The first bayside hotel in South Beach has a surprisingly mellow vibe. There is only one bar and one restaurant, which is actually a nice touch, minimizing the number of patrons that will show up in a given night. The pool area is beautiful and an ideal spot for sunsets. And for once, ample seating areas and no forced bottle service. If you're looking for something on the more mellow side, the Mondrian is a winner. Bottom line: color us impressed. The Standard: Another off-the-strip gem, the Standard isn't quite new, but is growing into its own as another nice, mellow alternative to the sceney Collins options. The pool area gets sun all the way through sunset and it attracts an interesting mix of locals and European tourists. What makes the Standard stand out is Andre Balazs ever-quirky design and the fantastic spa facilities. Bottom line: the new La Piaggia. Other notables from the last few days: Prime Italian is as packed as Prime One Twelve, Set went off on Sunday night, Florida Room has a good alterna-scene, Louis has a marble bust of owner Roman Jones' likeness, Gansevoort South is the worst designed hotel on the beach and the food still sucks at Quattro. Why oh why do we ever let ourselves get dragged there?

Liv is an unbelievable club. Packed beyond belief all the other nights other than tiesto. I agree w/ some of the things you said about the FB hotel in general, but isolated LIV nightclub has one of the most beautiful designed lighting and sound systems i've ever seen. you should probably take another look

2009-01-09 09:12:00
Yeah, I've heard Liv is fun. Heard was full of celebs at art basel this year. Also you didin't mention Scarpetta at Fountainbleu which is a beautiful interior deisgn job (food not as good as NYC one though). I think they've done a decent job with Fountainbleau reno; I mean give them a break that place is huge. Hard to personalize something so large. And yes Gansevoort South is the worst of the new hotels. Mondrian Miami is a nice alternative to Collins.

The last week of the December is not a standard time to open a restaurant, so we were surprised to see the newly unveiled 111 First Avenue. The space, which promises Small Plates and Wine, is putting the finishing touches on the interior and looks set to open any day now. That's great news for fans of, well, small plates and wine. And if you are one of the many who have recently been laid off and are looking for work, that sign on the door says the restaurant is hiring.

Dear Miami, We know it's been a hard year for the entire city. The collapse of your local real estate market, local job losses, foreclosures, and a slowing tourism business have surely weighed heavily on your collective psyche. We feel your pain and want you to know that we are thinking of you during this holiday season. Unfortunately, there is a bit more bad news before this dreadful 2008 comes to a close. We think it's better to just come right out and say it, so here goes: Matt Levine, and some of The Eldridge staff have relocated to Miami for the week to organize a few special nights leading up to the New Year. Calm down, Miami. Please calm down. Don't cry. It will be OK. It's just for 3 nights and that's it. We understand if it's a bit more than you can take after dealing with everything else, but we want you to know that you can count on us in your hour of need. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you need us. Happy Holidays, DBTH

We are happy to report that there are no issues.

We're reopening [Monday] at 6pm.\" And like everyone else, Apotheke is hosting it's own special New Years Eve celebration, offering guests unlimited champagne by the glass, speciality cocktails, beer, wine and passed hors d'oeuvres. It seems certain that Sir Trummer and his mixology wrecking crew will have some special tricks up their sleeve. Tickets are $200, with tables for 6 going for an even $1000.

Looking for an alternative to prix fixe dinners and overpriced tickets to crappy nightclubs? Are you also looking to eat in a new, trendy restaurant with some beautiful people? Shang, in the new Thompson LES, wants to win over your heart and mind, offering their full menu, fun tunes and a champagne toast and party favors for all guests. New Yeas Eve with no strings attached. That sounds pretty ok to us.

Is there finally some competition for the Beatrice Inn? According to the Styles section, the answer is yes. The challenger for the hearts and minds of the scenesters is Chloe 81 in the Lower East Side, where the fashionable set comes to sip cocktails, listen to the Smiths and stare at each other. How exciting! But if the Styles section says it, could it possibly be true? [NYT] Is it possible for a bar to relocate and hope to recreate the ambience that helped make it originally successful. The answer is of course unknown, since each individual instance is unique and dependent on a number of variables. Our latest transient is the P&G, which is relocating to a new space in the Upper West Side. Some of their old customers are worried, saying they'll \"feel out the new place. But we don't know if the new place is for us - we're old school.\" But if the regulars give up the new location because it's new, won't they just have to pick another new bar? Hmmm. [NYT] Who is the real king of New York nightlife? No, it's not DBTH. It's Reverend Gregory Malia from Wilkes Berre, PA, an Episcopal minister who has become a favored client at bottle service hot spots like Pink Elephant and Citrine. Known as Father Greg, he seems \"more than likely to spend money when the club is not packed. If it's packed, he doesn't do it. He doesn't want to draw attention.\" Because a priest leaving 30% tips, buying $35K bottles and taking waitresses on shopping sprees won't ever draw attention. But if he loves buying bottles, does he not know that Armand is simply the best? The best. [NYDN] Do you still not know how to cure a hangover? Eric Felton is the latest to dig around the topic, but again misses the real tonic for over-indulgence. The best way to cure a hangover is to not drink so much the night before. [WSJ]

The end of the year is a very slow news cycle. How slow? Let us show you: Ethan Browne, the son of legendary Jackson Browne, is a top model for Armani and Tommy Hilfigger andhe has a burgeoning music career. He will be hosting New Year's Eve with actor Jesse Bradford at The Plumm along with porn sensation Heather Hunter. Both Bradford and Browne appeared together in the cult film \"Hackers.\"Browne will also be spinning at the club New Year's Eve and he has approached The Plumm owner Noel Ashman about representing him on his new career as a club dee-jay. Did Ashman say yes? We are on the edge of our chairs here. We were also not aware that The Plumm was even still open. And can a new year's party get much lower than the son of a musician being paid as a host along with a 40 year old former porn star who's career apparently \"peaked in the mid 90's\"? This may not be the way to launch your new DJ career, Ethan. But at least this solves our New Year's plans.

The Grubbers get visual evidence of a Socialista shutdown by the DOH for a lack of No Smoking signs. At least its not Hepatitis, right? We can't help but wonder if this is a renewed effort by the Bloomberg adminstration to enforce the Smoking Ban that was passed in 2002 but is rarely enforced in certain hot spots. We all know how easy it is to post the rules of the house, even if management wants to look the other way.

Filed under better late than never, Sunday's Checking In column delved into the world of distressed hotel projects that cannot find the cash to make it to the finish line. Among the many projects that was much bally hooed and now seemingly dunzo is the Nobu Hotel New York, which was set to rise in Lower Manhattan, with financing to be provided by Lehman Brothers. Obviously that won't be happening any time soon. While this was probably more of a licensing play than a major equity investment by the Nobu team, this is a black eye on a glorious expansion run. We can't help but wonder how the rest of the empire will do during this down turn without all of the bankers and free wheeling expense accounters plopping down the corporate card for rock shrimp and ponzu sauce. Time will certainly tell.

Photo courtesy of NYMag Upon learning of this new gastropub, we headed straight for W4th street with our very own anglophile in tow. The HP sauce, fries and vinegar, and lack of tablecloths all received the stamp of authenticity so in we went for some Sunday night wining and dining. The cocktail list kept it simple, with twists like habenero sauce in your margarita. Our favorite cocktail was The Bramble, which reminded us of Madame Geneva - Gin and blackberry preserves. And what's a cold winter night inside a bar without a warm apple toddy? W&N makes theirs with calvados, so it's extra-appley and extra-delicious. We sat around for hours in the warmly-lit exposed brick and chill vibe and dreaded trekking outside in the snow. The only complaint was the waitstaff that attempted to take our drinks when half-finished - huge no no in our book - and forgot to bring us essentials like napkins, forks for our food, and water. All in all, though, a great neighborhood spot to while the time away in the company of good music, good food, good friends, and abysmal service, which is, apparently, also a trait of authentic British gastropubs everywhere.

Apparently, there is at least one person who is not a fan of the Eldridge. Frequent commenter, author, and girl about town Abbe Diaz let loose on the club and owner Matt Levine in the comments section last week, saying that after her group was personally invited to the lounge, they were still not let in. To make matters worse, Diaz says the doorman made a point to make them wait, saying \"even after he is SHOWN the e-mail (which apparently, you cc'd to him?) he still wants to make a spectacular \"display\" of us, seeing as there's NOBODY else waiting on line (and that's bad for your \"image,\" right?)\". Diaz and friends high tailed it out of there shortly after. The next day, Matty boy did send them all some of those famous engraved cards, which they of course won't use. Good times.

I have an engraved card given to me by their \"hospitality host\" opening week. A few weeks later I went with a female to show her the location. The doorman, Naeem, told me the card was meaningless and proceeded to call matt levine to see if he knew me. After waiting 15 mins at door they said i can come in since it was early but I would need reservations from Matt for my next visit. Inside it was me and 3 other people. Not sure what the point of having that card meant. So much for a service oreinted industry.

Down by the hipster is the biggest promoter of Matt Levine and the eldridge. If I had the time I would look back to see how many posts have been made about it. Do you realize that people go to the Eldridge to see if it is really as bad as this site makes it out to be? My bet is that most people are surprised that it isn't half bad. So either DBTH is in bed with Levine or just stupid

And what would a trip down memory lane be without detailing all of Paris Hilton's make-out sessions that took place inside it's hallowed walls. Memories. [NY Post] What's really in a name? The folks at Macao Trading Co. ran into a little controversy over their popular cocktail, Lovee Long Time, and have now changed the name to the Bashful Maiden. Same recipe, less offensive name. [NY Barfly] A Mulled Manhattan? We shudder at the thought of a muddled orange mixed with Cointreu, bitters and bourbon, which is then topped with grape juice. It sounds like something a child dares his friend to drink, but is being served at the Bedford Post. If you want a nice muddle grape drink, we suggest the Concord Grape Sazerac. [NY Times]

If you try and fail, try and try again. The Standard New York has taken this motto to heart, as they prepare to open for some guests while construction presses onward for most of the hotel. This time we really mean it... The Standard, New York is opening its doors to friends and family this Sunday, December 21st, 2008. We are opening a handful of rooms in the midst of an otherwise busy construction site, at rates starting at $195. This price includes complimentary Continental breakfast room service, complimentary Wi-Fi and local calls, 24 hour concierge service and use of our lobby. They are really pushing the use of the lobby. These rates only last until February (or whenever construction ends), so act fast!

New York Times alcohol blog Proof perks up again this morning with Iain Gately's tour of historical hangover cures. Iain recalls a particularly painful hangover of his own, in which he dealt with \"a migraine, blurred vision, liquid bowels, and shakes that started at my fingertips and reached to my elbows.\" Liquid bowels - yummo. The suggested rememdies are more of the same, and of course the winner is good old fashioned water. Didn't Ted Allen already tell us this? The more you know . . .

With all of the nonsense surrounding New Years Eve in New York, we were pleasantly surprised to get the Ranolph's proposal for 12/31. Billed as \"The most fun you can have without glowsticks\", a $35 entry fee buys you 2 delicious drinks and a Chandon champagne toast at midnight. That's a $315 savings off of some other parties we know, and requires no hand sanitizer. If you are interested, drop them a line.

While we say goodbye to one lap dance kingdom, another alleged lap dance den has made it through to 2009. Cordato's, a deli and and bar on Greenwich Street in the Financial District, had it's application for a liquor license renewal approved by CB 1. If you recall, the bar had applied for a hard to get cabaret license this year but was rejected based on allegations of lap dances being offered. Ro Sheffe, chairperson of the Financial District Committee, stepped up to the plate to do some recon on the space and saw nothing out of the ordinary, finding \"no exotic dancing, just a sparse crowd of regulars.\" Some members aren't convinced, but did not want to take away someone's livelihood so close to the holidays.

Allow us to please take a moment to prick the dream balloon of the masses who desire to spend this New Year's surrounded by socialites and celebrities at the Eldridge. You are not invited. Let us say that again - you are not invited. Matt Levine, maestro of the Lower East Side, contacted us to break the bad news, saying: This blurb you wrote is a false advertisement, and in no way being endorsed by The Eldridge.I am not sure where you found that blurb, but there are many websites saying they are selling tickets to The Eldridge, but meanwhile, we do not have any promoters working on New Years Eve,and due to our size, have only a certain number of tickets available, and entry will be approved by myself, and management. I am unaware of where you received that blurb from. When we explained that it came from the Bloc Group, Mr. Levine told us he had spoken to the higher ups there and cleared up the confusion. But we wondered, what about the people who had already purchased those $350 tickets? Is there a chance that they could show up on 12/31 and be not be approved by the owner or management? Mr. Levine waxed poetic on that as well. If anyone has purchased tickets via Matt Isaacs (Bloc Group) website, I will of course - honor it, but Matt Isaacs was instructed to take it down, because it was never approved by myself or The Eldridge, nor was the information and context of the promotions. Matt Isaacs is a good friend of mine, and it was just a matter of miscommunication which was cleared up, and the website and promotions will be taken down. The Eldridge did not endorse this, confirm this, or approve that listing, or any other listings currently posing to sell entry/tickets for New Years Eve. Good thing we already purchased our tickets! See you there in 13 days!

Even in this down market, the folks behind the Gansevoort Hotel group are not happy just sitting on the sidelines and hoping they make it through. Yesterday, they announced plans to enter into third party management ventures for three new hotel properties, including Gansevoort Turks & Caicos. According to the press release, the new Gansevoort will be \"a 91-room luxury property developed by Apollo Development Company. Located on the western section of Grace Bay Beach, the property boasts expansive beachfront along reef-protected ocean waters.\" Sounds lovely. And for those who love fine dining, the new venture will also feature Bagatelle Bistrot and Beach Club, serving up a slice of Meatpacking District Italian fare, a bumping Saturday brunch scene, and if we are all lucky, another branch of Kiss and Fly. After getting this puppy off the ground, Gansevoort will then move on to Chicago and Toronto.

They promise a surprise DJ and a top-notch crowd including both celebrities and socialites, the most dangerous and exciting demographic combination that you could ask for. All of this can be yours for the low price of $350, which in this economy, is the best deal we have heard of since the $5 foot long. You know what's up.

The ladies love the Blue. The first snowy night of December found us making our way through the West Village to 632 Hudson, best known as the former Real World house from Return to New York. We weren't there to relive history, but instead celebrate the season with our good friends from Urban Daddy and our even better friends from Johnnie Walker Blue. And just like the brand, the event was all class. Live jazz trio - check Food by Joey Campanaro - check Blue Label - check You can see why the evening was on point. Our only complaint was the only bar serving the good stuff was at the top of the house, all the way in the back, and crowd control made it difficult to access. But in the end, it didn't matter, because there was plenty of our good friends Green, Gold, Black and Red to keep us full of holiday cheer. Thanks to the Daddy for the invite. Your DBTH friends wish you a very merry New Year.

Just one day after learning about a possible new speakeasy cocktail lounge, DBTH has learned from someone not involved with space that nothing named Woodson and Ford exists. We repeat, there is no Woodson and Ford. From our Little Birdy who sits way up high in the tree: We are not open. We are only open for private events. The blogger on booze NYC was incorrect and has corrected his errors. If you could also correct them on your site as well. There is no official name and printing it is a problem since it involved our business partners. Please respect our wishes. When we are ready to open to the public we will let you know. While we have spoken to people who have been to the event space (\"really cool\", \"can't believe this is Table 50. Do you remember Q Tip Parties there?\"), like most good things it got out before it was time. People involved with the bar also took to the Boozer's comments to set the facts straight. We cherry picked some of the most poignant quotes, after the jump. for those of you under the assumption that this is any thing other than an event space let me clear something up quickly. the bar that was formerly mr.black does not yet have an official name, the space itself can only be rented or booked for private party purposes, hence the use of a password to keep un-invited guests firmly out! it will not be open to the public on a day to day basis at any time in the near future and neither is it an illegal space. please do not show up at the address because there is nothing open unless you have been invited by someone hosting a pre-arranged event there. And: As far as the space \"head bartender\" you will not receive any passwords. The unamed establishment is an event space. Clearly stealing our menus is frowned upon and since I would have seen you taking copious notes or taking photos I can only assume you vandalized our vintage books. I hope you enjoyed the event you attended but please fact check your blog. Woodson and ford is the zacapa cocktail name not the space. Boozey replies: Taking photos is easier than you think :) No books were vandalized in the process. You guys insist it's an event space and that's fine but I've never seen booze prices listed at a private party. That said, the place is great and we look forward to it being open for everyone. Welcome to the party BoozyNYC.

As part of his plan to cut New York State's massive budget deficit, Governor David Patterson has proposed a set of new taxes on various items. This proposed list calls for taxes on beer and wine to more than double. Flavored malt beverages would also be hit. This means drinking yourself out of this recession may get a bit more expensive. And in case you like your Jack Daniels with Coke, Patterson has also proposed an 18 percent levy on sugary, non-diet soft drinks. It may be time to switch to diet, tubby.

If you are looking to see a film this holiday season, why not check out Darren Aronofsky's The Wrestler, featuring Marquee's legendary doorman Wass Stevens as Nick Volpe. Rumor has it he beat out Artie Lange for the part, which is funny because they look so much alike. The film opens this Friday.

wass is such a conundrum. on one hand he is cool, and does a good door (even though he's stuck at marquee letting in middle schoolers), but on the other hand, his level of douchbaggery is totally off the charts.

Some of you are f*cking morons-especially \"doorman.\" Beyond the grim-faced doorman persona is a man with a family to feed and bills to pay. Wass makes more money as a doorman than most of us at our jobs. He's an accomplished actor who also teaches acting. He can be an asshole because people don't understand the word no. Don't take it personal-IT'S ONLY A FREAKING PARTY. I have gotten into any and everything that's cool or exclusive in this and other cities around the world and I still get turned down once in a while. Yes, its annoying but I walk away and forget about it. You might think your job holds more esteem but these venues would never be as hot without a selective door staff. At the end of the day, its disrespectful to ever knock the way a man makes his living. I've had BANKERS ask me to help them find bartending jobs. Remember Wesley Autrey, the construction worker who jumped onto the tracks ahead of an oncoming train to save a life? I guess he's still a tool cause he's just a construction worker. Never mind the successful and accomplished banker who cheated scores of victims out of their life savings. *sshole.

i'll tell you why i had a big problem with wass (it's a few years ago so i forgive the guy, but still....): because when i worked with him at one of the best clubs of the last decade i had a deal with the owners that entitled me to have \"a few of my friends in at any time for comp dinner and drinks\" on the night i worked. he always gave my people a hard time and gave me attitude about it, BUT he would let in 10 smelly dudes who were friends of the DJ, no questions asked! (and people wonder why DJs have such attitudes and ridiculous, overinflated egos)now i work behind the scenes for jason strauss' las vegas projects (his boss), but i'll be damned if wass would let me in to marquee... if i even WANTED to go inside that hellhole... without a call from strauss first. what's B.S. about the club scene is there isn't always professional courtesy among people who have worked for clubs. as much as people like to talk shit about alex julian of tenjune, the guy always takes care of me at the door right away, and he knows a lot less about the work i've done for the industry than wass does. let's face it, wass is an unnecessary asshole, but at the end of the day he's a great doorman. he's the doorman i love to hate.
MAveRiCk
2008-12-17 15:49:00
I gotta give it to you, Veteran on the industry courtesy point. I don't always get it myself, but then again my philosophy is if I have to remind you who I am, what's the point? There's one or two doormen who still might make me wait-when the door is slammed and its packed inside for some special event. I've had to turn my own friends away but they always understand its only a party and I'm doing my job. If I don't know you I can't possibly hate you-you just may not be the right fit for the venue or maybe courtesy and priority comes before you at the time, that's all. I'm sure your mom thinks you're handsome and stylish, but...

veteran
2008-12-17 17:24:00
actually i DO \"fit the party\" and that's why i go to the hotspots (cipriane, bijoux, 1OAK, submercer, rosebar, etc), and i frequently roll with models and creative/fashion industry people. i went to marquee a lot at the beginning, and i even saw the place when there was still sawdust on the floor. the problem is only with wass and his 'tude. since you don't know anything about me, \"2Maverick\", your comment is meaningless.

Broadway and DBTH aren't exactly like Zach Morris and Kelly Kapowski, but when a friend invited us to the star-studded Shrek premiere, our inner tourist/US Weekly fanatic couldn't resist. So the DBTH team sucked it up and ventured up to the Theater District Sunday night. We found the show itself one of the more entertaining, complete with a standout set, cast, and creative direction. Plus, who can remain stoic in the face of such a heartwarming tale? Certainly not us. We even spotted Cameron Diaz, Jack Nicholson, and assorted other major celebrities, including the mom from the Cosby Show, and Ugly Betty stars. Golly, we were star struck by the time we headed over to the Plaza for the afterparty. The Shrek folk put on quite the partay. The Plaza's second floor ballroom reminds us of the gilded age to begin with and the free flowing bubbly and lavish food served to make us feel like 1929 pre-crash. Or, dare we say, 2007 pre-crash? DJ Berrie's masterful spinning ensured that old and young alike got funky on the dance floor. We had so much fun we even stayed until the oldies came on.

Boozy NYC, the latest blog to step into the world of night, drops word of yet another speakeasy that is set to open this week. The space that once held the beloved Table 50 and the original Mr. Black is now home to Woodson and Ford, below the unmemorable Corner Shop C on Broadway in Greenwich Village. The room was first used in 1855 and was designed to mimic a German beer hall and has held a colorful (brothel) and sometimes tragic (deadly fire at Infinity Disco in 1979) history. According to the Booze, today \"The decor (and staff) will be familiar to anyone who's been to Apotheke, Tailor or Clover Club - lots of wood, plush sofas, old-fashioned light fixtures,\" and the Woodson and Ford cocktail (applejack, zacapa 23, benedictine, sweet vermouth, Fee brothers' whiskey barrel bitters) are apparently going down smooth for $12. The full cocktail menu is after the jump.

During these chilly winter months, its better to stay indoors whenever possible. But an uneexpected crowd at your favorite watering hole could force you to deal with the elements instead of enjoying your favorite cocktail with friends indoors. Rather than standing outside in the cold, hoping to gain access to your favorite bar or lounge, it's always better to find a warmer alternative. We bring you exhibit A. For those wanting to gain access to Southside, the Martignetti brothers revamped Nolita lounge, you could show up early and wait for the crowd to pick up. Or you could take this secret, underground entrance and join the party at your leisure. Irwin M. Fletcher you choose.

While we love free booze (we are still accepting offers!), we hate worthless shill requests. Take this one we received over the weekend. My Name is Justin, I have been reading your blog for a few months now, I love it!. I am always looking for new fashion and grooming advice. I came across a new shaving shop in Soho on XXXX called the XXXXXX. I was greeted as soon as I walked in the door in a very friendly way. I felt like I was stepping back in time as music from the turn of the century plays all day. They make really nice shaving brushes, razors and carry natural products too. I was offered a drink from espresso to whiskey and opted for the ladder. I got the Ultimate Shave and it was a thrilling experience. It was the best shave of my life! Where to begin. Who is always looking for new grooming advice? Does turn of the century music reference the 19th century or the 20th? Is the ladder a type of beverage? Did someone really get paid for this? No wonder the economy is in this state.

Franklin Park, Anatoly Dubinsky and Matthew Roff's new bar in Crown Heights, has given the neighborhood's gentrifiers a cocktail lounge of their own. Huzzah! But after reading the lovely write up of the bar, courtyard, annex and game room in this weekend's BoÎte column, we took pause and chuckled at the suggested Dress Code: Facial hair, cabby hats, zippered sweaters and jeans for men. Oversize cardigans, leggings or skinny jeans, long scarves and flat boots for women. From what we have seen on the streets (and Kanye), the ladies style is what many Brooklyn fellas have been wearing for some time. And for men who aren't rocking a \"cabby hat\", prepare to feel out of place. We guess. [NYT]

One way to guarantee some DBTH love is to send us booze. Especially high quality booze. We are shameless and always thirsty, so getting bottles of liquor by messenger service is guaranteed to put a smile on our faces. Today's winner is Maestro Tequila, \"the world's first-ever, clear-aged diamond tequila\" and will be available in New York beginning in March, 2009. Yay for us and yay for you. Yay yay yay. The production is limited, and each bottle is numbered and dated. We got #1096. Sounds lucky. Althought we are drinking it neat, the Maestro folks were gracious enough to provide you with some delicious recipes. To see them, just click through. If you want some DBTH love for some booze, let us know. <span style=\"font-size: 10pt; font-family: \"Trebuchet MS\";\"> Recipes: The Maestro Mixer 5 white grapes 8-10 mint leaves 2 oz Maestro Dobel Tequila ¾ oz Aperol ½ oz lemon juice ¾ oz simple syrup 1 oz ginger ale In a pint glass, add mint and grapes and muddle.

As a sign of the times, restaurant and bar owners have begun to reduce or flatten drink prices. Jean George's Perry Street has cut the price of wine that accompanies the prix fixe lunch, and Sasha Petraske's upcoming Dutch Kills tavern in Long Island City will sell cocktails for a reasonable $8.50. There may be a slight discount for location tied to the latter, but the decline of the overpriced drink seems to have arrived. More booze for your buck buck, it will be a merry new year.

New Years Eve in New York City brings out a special kind of party goer. You pay a few hundo for a ticket, put on your best clothes, make sure your breath is fresh, and then get as many drinks from the open \"premium\" bar as possible. If all goes well, you grab someone around 2 and make a break for home base, otherwise you are stuck in the same club until 4 AM picking over the singles scrap heap and then praying you can find a cab to go home by yourself. It's the best night of the year! Especially for club owners, who rake in mucho buckos selling those tickets and tables to eager out of towners who are desperate to get inside the City's hottest parties. And to sell those tickets, club owners go deep inside their limited grammar bases to entice you to buy. Here are our favorites Greenhouse - Mother Earth's Most Upscale New Club. Come Party and Save the Environment! Marquee - Hosted by Mario Lopez! Rated New Year's Eve 2009's Hottest Party in the Universe! Cirpriani 23rd Street - Rated NYC's #1 Most Glamorous Event for New Year's Eve 2009 Cipriani 42nd Street - Voted #1 NYE 2009 Event in the Country! Home/Guest House - Rated #1 Sizzling Hot NYE 2009 Nightclub - 2 Parties=2 Times The Hotness! STK - Meatpacking District's Sexiest, Vamped-Up NYE Fete of the Year! If you are keeping score, Cirpiani 23rd St is rated NYC's #1 Most Glam event, but somehow Cipriani 42nd Street is the #1 NYE Event in the country. Maybe it's not as glam. And Marquee is the hottest party in the universe, which we know is bigger than NYC and the country, but does the rest of the universe follow our calendar? Doubtful. And if you have been sucked in by the green revolution, then buying a ticket to Greenhouse's event will somehow help you Save the Environment. And where will we be on this special night? We aren't sure we are ready to share that with you.

It's not owners who write that its the promoters and they list it like that to bring in the tourist.I don't know if Cipriani 42nd Street is the best event in the country but, it will probably be the best in the city.

were you the promoter that wrote that for Cip's?

If 42nd Street is the best in the City, then what is 23rd street?
FOR REAL
2008-12-12 21:59:00
Nope. I wish I came up with it though. 23rd street is the worst of the the Cipriani's. I'm not sure what is going on there but, I don't expect much.

Tear. Scores East, the pioneering strip club that brought class to the masses paying to see asses (heh) will close before the end of the year. The club, which opened in 1990, drew numerous bold faced names during its hey day, and helped prove that strip clubs could become legitimate nightlife destinations in New York. Scores bid to open a national chain seemed to mark the beginning of the end, and by the end of the year, the company will cease to exist. According to reports, a new strip club with a new name and new owners will open at the 333 E. 60th St location. While fans of Scores will be pouring one out in its memory, we know Lonnie Hanover is smiling. [Daily News]

I worked at scores for 3 years.. Those were the days.. It would literally be raining money! Girl would make like 5G's a night! The new owners own Sapphire and I think that is what the clubs will be called. They are opening Jan. 5th. They have anothe locaiton in Chelsea on 23rd street and 10th 11th Ave. Hopefully al lthe Scores old clientele will come there.

There it is - just as we descibed. NYE will be the official send-off for Upstairs, a self described Nightlife Institution. We aren't so sure about that, but we do love that formal attire is required. Tickets start at just $120 for the Silver GA tickets, and Platinum Silver Ultra Stage Table seats will run you $500. What a country! Tickets are available here, or you can buy them these asshats. Your choice.

Most creative, fun people these days never even think of Danny A when they want to go out. Maybe some poor model that he abused 10yrs ago does? This blog is sad and Im not reading it anymore.

There have been innumerable gimmicks to be unleased on the citizens of New York City. Ninja. LEED nightclubs. Make Your Own Wine. You get the point. But La Cave des Fondus, which is poised to open tomorrow in Nolita has trumped them all. The restaurant, an homage to Montmartre restaurant Le Refuge des Fondu, will be offering its wine and beer to customers in baby bottles. We will say it again. Baby bottles. Owner Jacques Ouari tells the Times: \"I wanted to set up my place exactly like the one in Paris. It's such a fun place. Everybody loves drinking beer and wine from baby bottles - even my father thought it was fun - and I think New Yorkers will like it too. I checked with the health department and as long as we put the bottles in the dishwasher they have no problem with it.\" This is what you could look like. Is that what you want for yourself? Sadly, we predict that the scenetards will get a big, idiot kick out of this. But don't be fooled. You are adults. You drink out of glasses, bottles or sometimes right out of the mofo box. But not baby bottles. We repeat, not baby bottles. [Diner's Journal]

whoops guess the diners club author hasn't spent much time in paris sucking liquor out of a nipple.on some levels this concept works but not so much with wine, unless you are using the baby bottle to skirt a tax law on wine service. Best Bar to Access Your Inner Child - Le Grimace For the very young at heart, Le Grimace is the bar for you. In this tiny\"hole-in-the-wall\" club, rock to 80's tunes, while you suck your drink out of a baby bottle. Strange, but true - all drinks are served in baby bottles, and they're harder to drink than you might think. There is a real art to sucking. To keep with the theme, the drinks have naughty names like \"Ejac-Face.\" 60 rue Mazarine, 6e.

Last week, DBTH stopped by the International Culinary Center to attend a Seasonal Mixology course, taught by DBTH favorite Michael Cecconi of Savoy and the Back Forty. The course was a two hour run trhough the mixology basics, giving the home mixer basic concepts, lessons on thinking outside the cocktail box, and most important, cocktail and spirit tasting. Michael implored his students to buy local whenever it was possible, and always use fresh, seasonal ingredients. Other key take-aways from the expert: On hangovers: \"The only reason people get hangovers is they drink too much\" On buying vodka: \"Buy local. No plastic bottles. No Trump.\" By the end of the class, we had tasted 4 types of spirits and 4 cocktails, including a now in season Meyer Lemon Mojito and a Concord Grape Sazerac. We walked out of there a little buzzed, a lot more knowledgeable about mixology, and wistful that our own education wasn't similar to the event.

1. Nick Jones has transformed himself from a failed restauranteur to the biggest name in the world of oh so exclusive and private clubs. Just months after selling an 80% stake in his empire to Richard Caring, Jones is busy at work managing the opening of Soho House West Hollywood and Cecconi's. Jones also shrugs Wall Street's impact on his business, saying \"We're not immune to recession, but we're lucky that a lot of our customers are not directly affected.\" Good for you. [Times Online] 2. The Latin Quarter is more than a place for NFL players to shoot themselves in the leg. It's also known for it's live music and according to school teacher Sylvia Roman, \"It's a great place to dance and have fun, and we don't come to shoot anybody.\" That's our kind of nightlife. [NY Times] 3. If you are sick of the work week already, feel free to look forward to tonight's festivities. A LB writes, \"Just wanted to let you guys know that Johnny Utah's will be celebrating their 1 year anniversary of the Monday Night Bull Riding Challenge this Monday, Dec 8th. 10pm - 2am. It's been a tremendous success and would love to see everyone come celebrate with us.\" Huzzah! [DBTH Birdy Wire]

Secret groups and underground parties have a way of luring us in. It's not the exclusivity as much as the effort (or lack thereof) that the organizers go to create something that strives to be exclusive. Get it? So when we received an email from The Society, inviting DBTH to their Town and Country winter party, we figured it was our duty to check it out. If not DBTH then who? Members are informed of the location the night before, and in this case it was the penthouse of the Gild Hall hotel. We elevatored our way to the 18th floor and followed the music, stepping into a chic 2 bedroom suite, decked out with a full spread provided by the Libertine, open bar featuring Hot Toddies and a boatload of plaid. Besides the overwhelming number of Canadians (the Society was founded in Toronto), it was mostly just a normal party. But a fun party at that. Speaking to founding members Amanda, Ashleigh and Annie, the group sees itself as an alternative to the celeb fueled Cinema Society, organizing events for interesting people in interesting places. Interesting. It may be just what these young kids need to make it through these troubling times. We saw it as an oppotunity to make new friends and drink bourbon. In the end, we were all happy, and that's what it's all about. More pics after the jump Mini Hot Dogs and Soft Pretzels! Society Members You know these three can party.

Tis the season for helping your friends and doing your all to provide a helping hand to strangers that are in need. So sweet. So today we ask you, our faithful readers, to lend a hand to an Aussie Bloke who is making his first trip to New York City for New Years Eve. I've been reading your site trying to get a feel for a good place for NYE this year in NYC to go with my mates from Aus. I was thinking about Pink Elephant but have gone a bit off it after all the turmoil. The other option was Home. I've never been to New York before (I'm am so pumped its not funny) but I get the impression that the events at these places will be a bit of a w@nk with lots of tourists like me. What I'm really after is some electro-house in a cool club with hot chicas, selective clientele and not so cheesy! Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. For someone who has never been here, it seems they already have a pretty good handle on what not to do. So what do you say campers? Anyone have some down and dirty tips for our friend from Down Under?

That Pacha comment is a bit off the mark. Yes the druggies will be there till 10PM but the party gets poppin at about 430 am and there are NO tourists, there is trannys, asians, a couple of meat heads, def hot colombian girls some gays and some old school house heads. It is eclectic to say the least. Just get out before noon and you will be ok.. That party is less upscale but more insane than what you will find at Cielo. No knock to Cielo just different crowd makeup and less sexy. I honestly stay away from major clubs NYE because owners make so much money on this night that they overfill their venues and it is too packed to even enjoy yourself table or not! Go to a house party save on the cover or bottle minimum and surround yourself with your friends!!

Photo Credit It's been a long time in the making, but the Standard NYC is just about ready to welcome you. We say just about because the hotel is making select rooms available to \"friends and family\" at an introductory rate starting on December 10th, and the place is still a busy construction site. We are opening a handful of rooms in the midst of an otherwise busy construction site, at rates starting at $195. The price includes complimentary Continental breakfast, complimentary Wi-Fi and local calls, 24 hour concierge service and use of our lobby.Room service will be available in early 2009. In the interim, guests will receive an in-room binder consisting of our favorite local restaurants which will provide delivery service.As the hotel is still undergoing construction, these preview rates will be available until February 09. To make your booking, simply call the reservations team at 212 784.5530 or email us at nyreservations@standardhotel.com. But hey, $195 for a nice hotel room is a good deal. And the view can't be beat. We suggest you jump on this deal while you still can. Just wear a hard hat.

Gansevoort Hotel 2: Douches with a View.This monstrosity, sadly, will be Andre Balazs' bête noire. I heard they were already trying to downplay the Balazs name and Standard brand, in an attempt to distance themselves from the douche mass that will soon be infesting their lobby. Did Mr. Balazs not visit the cesspool that is the meatpacking district on a weekend night before jumping ass-first into it?

From the desk of the Daddy, a little surprise from the depths of Little Branch, Sasha Petraske's below ground cocktail den in the heart of the West Village. According to UD, the Branch has forever been running a secret private bar while packed-in patrons struggle to find a comfy space to sip their $15 cocktails. To get access, \"duck past the curtain and up the stairs (back to ground level) for a secret floor that's managed to stay under the radar for the more than three years LB has been open.\" Oops. The room is perfect for small groups looking to keep it chill and don't mind dropping $400 an hour for their own private bartender. Seems worth it to us. Happy branching.

After the double dip of staff departures, a former Pink Elephant insider who recently abandoned the club after being involved over the past 4 years to tell us what's up. To sum it up - shit show. According to the Pink Birdy, Place is a mess. Struggling to survive really. Everyone who made the venue a success over the last 4 years has left from promoters to staff to partners. Nosediving right into 2009 This mass exodus shouldn't stop you from giving your favorite promoters at least $225 to buy a New Years ticket - it may be the final fiesta at the Pink.

I'm reading all this propaganda and quite frankly it's comical ! I go to all these places , and there is no where that has the vibe as Pink ! TenJune is a basement with pain in the ass alex at the door . 1Oak ; you're kidding right ... Marquis, is ancient with a horribel main room that has zero atmosphere ! Guest House ; Enough said ! Look around ... THere's no where that has a cooler vibe and nicer staff than Pink ! And while somepeople have left, the waitress' are stil mostly there and from a customer's point of view ; that's what counts ! Is there room in this city for another club ? ALWAYS but right now at this moment , I wouldn't want to go anywhere else when the party is on the line !

Is it over for Pink Elephant? After Shawn Kolodny announced his departure late last night, DBTH has just received word that Pink's Director of Events Timonthy Fried has also left the company, saying: I wanted to take the time to let everyone know that I will no longer continue working with Pink Elephant or any affiliated properties as the Director of Events. That's two key players in one day, leading us to believe that it's curtain for Pink Elephant. The club, which just celebrated it's fourth anniversary, appears to be on death's doorstep. Will 27th ever be the same? Of course. But it's still sad.

Why are they all leaving all of a sudden?
Mark Key
2008-12-03 15:45:00
I am pretty sure Tim was fired. He didnt leave. And Shawn is working as host assistant at the other club. I wouldnt call that a lateral or upwards move. Seems, actually, UTTERLY EMBARASSING if you ask me! He must have sold his pride and dignity to get this gig. Seriously.And Pink just had the most expensive table EVER in NYC history. That table alone would keep them open for months. That table was revenue from some clubs for an entire month. Let alone one night.Also, Kiss and Fly is where all the people fired from Pink Elephant for a lack of performance go to work. Whats the saying?Imitation is the sincerist form of flaterring? or something to that effect.Either way, Shawn seems like a lost boy. Not sure if he is even sane at this point, or if he is just selling out and trying to get as much from his list of people he's met over the years to come to KNF so he can get commision off them and pimp out his rolodex and not give a shit. Takes balls to demote yourself like that. An owner to host assistant. At least he has a job, I guess.Tim is nobody.Shawn 15 years owner/operator of some of NYC's best clubs and is now a host assistant making 200 dollars a night?Sounds to me like something more is going on to this story. People dont \"leave\" jobs in December on their own will without another job lined up. So obviously Tim was fired. That seems pretty clear in his email. Otherwise he would have said he was worknig somewhere else. Like Shawn did.

No speculation on Tim, but Shawn and the other promoter owners really do nothing for the place. The only sad part is that the club remains a success despite the fact that the owners are sleaseball perverts. Shawn left to host at Citrine...so..well....that tells you what he is worth. Next Rocco will leave to go polish silverware at Merkato55, again, no big loss. And correction, but Kiss and Fly is full of Guesthouse rejects, not Pink rejects. And apparently bottle girls are leaving Mr. West so quickly, they are hiring chicks with no experience (and no eyebrows, per the rumor). Hell in a handbasket...

Its a fact. It was on the front page of the London sun. 200K. The guys bought a couple hundred bottles of Champagne and just gave it out to the club. I was there and it was truly the craziest thing I have ever seen in a nightclub.

Give props where props is due... Pink has been going strong for 4 years... Yes, it's had times where its been better or worse, but it's been going strong none the less... Keep in mind it's not a small place either, like bungalow 8, rose bar or Mr. West, which would make it easier to fill with a good crowd... And if it wasn't for Pink, Kiss and Fly wouldn't exist - guess they would have tried to copy another club. NY Oracle, are you for real knocking Rocco like that? The guy has been behind some of the best parties in NYC history - Pink, Sundays at Pangaea, and Boom back in the 90's to name a few....

FOR REAL and anti B&T - yes I am . FOR REAL I was also at that night at Pink and know the guy (loosely, I'll admit) giving away all the booze. Do you remember what night of the week it was? I am not clueless...And antiB&T - Yes. Association does NOT mean delivery. There are people that have been \"associated\" with all kinds of parties, but don't actually DO anything. Think about it. These guys have been working at clubs for 10, some 15 years. If you work at any other business that long, you are either a major player, or potentially owning/at the top of the game. Guys like Noah and Jason, Mark Baker, etc. You can't even compare their impact to people like Rocco, or Richie Akiva, and they have been at it half as long. Its the difference between hard work, and posturing. If it don't make dollars, it don't make sense...
For Real
2008-12-04 12:51:00
I know them more then loosely and it was a Wednesday wise ass.FYI 1OAK, Richie Akiva's Spot.....Makes the most money in the city right now. Your comparisons are all wrong because Baker and Rocco have been at it for a similar time frame. Same for Noah and Richie.
antiB&T
2008-12-04 13:15:00
Wasn't gonna keep responding but I feel a follow up is due to NYCOracle - I agree with you 100% that Noah, Jason and Baker are very successful owners/operators - they've put together very successful businesses... For Real is right when he says that Akiva's spot is doing great...especially in such a crappy economy... And Rocco isn't \"posturing\" as you say... He is a partner there... He's also been a partner in other venues in the past not just in NYC, but also Miami and the Hamptons... The easy thing to do is let in B and T (I am antiB&T!!!!) to let them spend thousands, but places that do that don't stick around for 4 years! So many partners try to cash out and sell their share when a club is at it's peak - maybe you think that lack of loyalty to a club/restaurant/project is how one defines success... That is how you burn bridges and ruin your name... Do you think what David Graziano did to pink was ethical? He even went so far as to stealing Pink's customers contact information....By the way, further props to the Marquee guys for keeping it going so long... Not my favorite club at all, haven't been there in years and it ain't my thing - but that place is a well run business...

FOR REAL, I cede the point, it was a Wednesday and PK was spraying it all around. But c'mon 1Oak does not make money bro...the tables are all comp! Have you ever seen anyone pull out a credit card at the door? I will say for its follies, Pink does still churn a lot of cash. I'm pretty sure 1Oak will not survive the summer, as become as empty as GSpa.

Photo courtesy of Eater Last night, DBTH ventured way uptown to check out Fish Tail, David Burke's new sustainable fish focused restaurant on East 62nd. The reason? The invite promised free food and drinks, and in this economy, that sounded like a pretty good deal. The place was jammed to the gills (get it?) on our arrival and stayed that way throughout, with Upper East Siders literally jumping out of their seats at the first sight of a waiter with any morsel of food on their tray. At one point, we saw a woman in a fur coat (one of many) grabbing garbage from a bus boy, confusing a napkin for a scallop. Stay classy, y'all. Just when we were ready to give up and head back downtown to normalville, we managed to snag a space at the raw bar and were treated to a cornicopia of oysters and sashimi that made the whole night worthwhile. Thankfully. We departed soon after and walked into a crowd of about 30 uptowners who were standing in the cold, hoping to be let in. David Burke certainly draws a crowd.

In a major nightclub shakeup, Shawn Kolodny has ankled his post as Marketing Director at Pink Elephant and taken a position with the Kiss and Fly operation. Kolodny sent a message to his contacts via Facebook, saying I wanted to let you know that I will be leaving Pink Elephant. It is with great sadness that I have to leave Pink Elephant, a company I founded and built into a international nightlife brand over the past 4 years. Therefore, it is with great excitement that I am joining the Kiss and Fly, Bagatelle, and RDV family. I look forward to seeing you at my new home. Please let me know if you want to come to the club, restaurant or the lounge. I can help you with any of your needs, whether it is for a table reservation, a special event, or our new private dining. My new email address is Shawn@kissandflyclub.com and my phone number has stayed the same, 917 208 2072. I look forward to sharing all three venues with you! Does this spell additional trouble for Pink Elephant, a club which had its sights set on international expansion but not appears to be facing upheaval on the home front, first with a bankruptcy filing and now losing a key team member. This hire seems to also cement Kiss and Fly's position in the scene, where is has quietly enjoyed an outstanding run in an area that most considered way past its prime. It's going to be a wild 2009.

From DBTH West Coast comes Ecco, a new and totally green nightclub in the heart of Hollywood. Owned by Danny B, David Stratton, Sean Muniz and Matthew Portnoff, Ecco ain't just buying wind credits. Instead, the club's power will be supplied by the LA Department of Water & Power's Green Power resources. How green! And a Little Birdy tells us that this place is going to be big, saying they are having \"huge opening night party this Wednesday and it sounds like the real deal (although based on the pics, the design isnt as baller). The whole launch of the show apparently will be documented in a Discovery Channel show hosted by Adrian Grenier. Greenhouse did it first, but Ecco gets to be closer to the celebs, aka all the press you could possibly want.\" It seems that the celebs will flock to anything green, it just may be Ecco, and not Greenhouse.

For those who dabble in the white world, it may be time to think twice about what is really in your $50 baggie. Officials in Alberta have discovered that Canadian coke heads have been exposed to tainted blow, and seven people have been diagnosed with \"agranulocytosis, a condition that makes the immune system incapable of fighting off infections.\" This is something a flu shot will not prevent people. Apparently, \"officials have linked the cases to cocaine laced with levamisole, a chemical compound developed to treat intestinal worms in humans and animals.\" And now people are snorting it for fun. What a wonderful world. [CBC]

Courtesy of NY Post Two State Liquor Authority commissioners who voted to approve Ciprianis liquor licenses, despite their being convicted of tax evasion, were recently given State owned vehicles for unlimited use. Usually, only the SLA chairman get use of a car, and this perk was granted just weeks after the SLA let the Cipriani family stay in business. This disovery is another sign of some serious back rubbing to make sure the Cirpriani family kept their valuable venues in operation. [NY Post] Ever have doobie in your funk? What about smoke in your drink? Smoked ingredients are becoming a staple in bartenders recipe books, finding their way into cocktails as spirits, mixers, syrups or garnishes. Our favorite of the moment is a Smoky Rob Roy, which is a great comedown after a hearty meal. [NY Times] For those still nursing a holiday hangover, head over to Times Square at 11:30 to celebrate the 75th Anniversary of the Bloody Mary. What a happy day! [DBTH staff]

After learning that Giants star Plaxico Burress had shot himself late Friday night at a New York nightclub, DBTH has learned that Plaxico spent the night at Prana (79 Madison Avenue), attending what was billed as \"the NY Giants Post-Thanksgiving Party\". A Little Birdy filed this report, \"i imagine it was prana since the giants had their party there but i left at 4am and didnt hear no gunshots so...really i cant confirm. i remembered seeing him...wearing red..with some girl all over him in the vip section. maybe it was an after-hour?\" Maybe indeed. We were guessing the Eldridge. We will continue to update the story throughout the day. Stay tuned. Update: Espn.com is reporting that the incident happened at the Latin Quarter, a restaurant, lounge and nightclub in a midtown Radisson. Say wha? We are sticking with our LB who saw Plax at Prana during the Giants post TG but pre Saturday departure for Washington for their weekend game. Anyone know a bookie? We think we smell a Redskins win. [ESPN] Update #2: The Post confirms that Plax indeed shot himself while at LQ, reporting that Burress admitted to the guards that he was carrying heat. He then allegedly moved over to a secluded area away from the club's velvet rope with a guard and started taking the gun out. It's not clear exactly what happened next, but Burress apparently started trying to unload the bullets from the gun and bobbled it. A shot went off accidentally, ripping through his leg. The man obviously knows his way around a pistol. The moral of this story is, of course, never go out in Midtown. Consider this case closed. The tip line is open!

Sorry to interrupt our own Thanksgiving holiday. We have breaking news that Giants star Plaxico Burress has apparently shot himself in the leg during a trip to an unnamed New York City nightclub. Plax, who was ruled out of Sunday's game, is reportedly in stable condition with non life-threatening injuries. Good for him, but seriously, who shoots themselves? Idiot. [FoxSports.com] Any details should be sent to the tip line immediately.

It is also hosted by Scott Buchheit, Cayte Grieve and Kristian Laliberte. And if all of those people don't handle their responsibilities, you can be damn sure that Matt Levine (who brought you to this event) will handle his business.

The air may be thinner this far uptown, but it's worth being lightheaded when we're talking about another round of the Belvedere Uptown Meets Downtown party series. This weeks installment had jewelry line House of Waris co-presenting and the fiesta took over the Royal Terrace Suite and the newly renovated Plaza. Royal, indeed. If we had a nickel for every party we went to with bathtubs full of Belvie on ice... The small crowd included Damon Dash and some socialite girl named Olivia.

Have you not made it down to the Greenhouse yet? Green Inc. headed down last Thursday for opening night part II to verify the green bona fides. The story is mostly a retread of what has been said before, except for the club's success strategy, beautifully illuminated by head host Bey Archer. He explains that being green will bring in the \"celebrity-filled charity events and benefits\", and thus make Greenhouse rise to the top of the crappy NYC club scene. Archer says \"This is a public relations magnet. There isn't a person in Hollywood that doesn't want to have a green image.\" Do they have any other ideas for the economy as a whole? Where can we invest?

W Magazine (wtf?) gets the scoop on Ken Friedman and April Bloomfield's restaurant plans for the Ace Hotel, but we love the follow up story complete with shots of some already finished rooms of the oh so different concept property. Please take notice of the fridge, the records, and the mismatched furniture that makes the whole thing just scream ACE! It seems that the hotel is also taking reservations via its website, and the prices are definitely not typical Manhattan. For $209 you can get a \"cheap room\", which is smaller but has a private bathroom. No fridge though. An additional $50 will take you to the next level, and just $879 gets you the 700 SF loft room, where all the magic will happen. Somehow, we are predicting wild things at this place. Full price list and additional photos after the jump! Bunk Bed - $209 Cheap Full - $209 Cheap Queen -$209 Standard Full - $259 Standard Queen - $259 Standad King - $259 Deluxe Full - $309 Deluxe Queen - $309 Deluxe King - $309 Super Deluxe Double Double - $459 Super Deluxe King - $459 Loft - $879

More weekend wrap up fun, as our friends at Page Six the Magazine hit us with two wonderful stories from the nightlife scene. Ever wanted to know more about the City's hottest DJ's? The Mag gets the low down on five of the biggest names around: Matt Creed, DJ Reach, Jesse Marco, DJ Cassidy and Samantha Ronson, summed up by one nightlife insider \"Besides being LiLo's squeeze, Sam is basically worthless\". Ouchy. Superstar Joshua David Stein heads over to the Meatpacking District to check in on the nightlife scene's most underrated contributors - the European Gold Diggers. It seems these money honeys are wondering where they will get their drinks from now that the bottle buyers have dissapeared. But these troubling times don't mean these scensters are going to lower their standards. For example, Sammy the 37 year old real estate broker says \"Will I knowingly date somebody who is in the sh--ter right now? Probably not.\" Guess she is cutting her dating pool by several people a day.

In what seems like a quarterly occurrance, the over priced and over hyped Lower East Side \"performance theater\" and nightclub the Box gets the New York treatment, labeling the club and show director/owner Simon Hammerstein as \"The Impresario of Smut\". That ought to make him feel all warm and cuddly inside. For kickers, our friends at Page Six interview club investor Moby, who says \"I don't really go there too often. I like degeneracy . . . but the things that go on there don't make sense to me.\" That makes three of us. But it must make sense to some people, because the club still packs in revelers and tourists during the weekends.

Last night, DBTH headed over to the Bowery Hotel for some cause we aren't quite clear on. Something about diabetes, children, and/or starving artists. Anyway, we were pleasantly surprised by the hipness of the crowd (roughly equal ratio of plaid shirts to pairs of Louboutins, par instance), which included the likes of Charlotte Ronson, Maggie Rizer, Keith, Theodora, and Alexandra Richards, and DJ Cassidy. We actually liked some of the art to boot! DJ Berrie got it right again, spinning classic rock mixed with the likes of The Virgins, pretty commiserate with crowd and locale. No signature drink, which was just as well, we'll raise our glasses of red to good music, art, and fashion. Just when things were heating up though, we spotted the King of Cool, Matt Levine of The Eldridge fame and decided the crowd had gotten just too awesome for us. Lit Lounge, here we come.

DBTH fav Abbe Diaz received an invitation to the Greenhouse Grand Opening (Part II) and for some reason decided to check it out. It seems that was a bad decision on her part, but lucky for us she decided to share her story. Without further ado: okay seriously i felt badly cuz i had just made a little karim-amatullah joke here last week. and so i get this invite thingie in my inbox yesterday, and so LIKE A DUMBASS i decide: \"oh okay. i should go and check it out.\" now-- REALLY NOW. sorry, but i don't \"do\" clubland anymore. i am 40 years old and the idea i should be anywheres but in bed with booboo at 1AM is totally fucking ludicrous to me. so when i get an \"invitation\" at an e-mail address that, quite frankly, i naively believe only TWO promoters in the world (amatullah and ronnie-madra) actually have-- i figure: \"yes okay i should go and support the peeps.\" yah so. the fucking things says 10PM on it, yes? so i decide to go immediately following dinner. 10:25pm. i am told: \"they're not ready yet\" by a seriously attatoody fuck at the door. some nice guy standing next to him offers to check the list, but then attatoody fuck says to him, \"no, there's no list tonight.\" what the fuck is the invitation for then, hmm ?? so, in essence, i dragged a pretty prominent figure of the F&B industry to a club at 10:20pm when he would rather be home instead, just to be dissed at the door by some dumb attatoody mutherfukker. yah, it's pretty irritating, not to mention embarrassing. so, \"Greenhouse Family,\" whomever you are: SUCK IT. seriously. We warned you that 10:00 was not to be trusted, but it seems Abbe didn't get the message. Sorry. But the real question is, after 2 years of pre-opening publicity, is Greenhouse on the fast track to suckville?

Pains me. Especially since I was a patro of the Sunday morning parties at The Shelter with Timmy Regisford. I don't want to go down memory lane but that club was a sort of home to some of us, and I understand how the business works, but it is just sad what it has become. That along with the rest of New York. But I don't think we need anymore whiners....

okay seriouslyi felt badly cuz i had just made a little karim-amatullah joke here last week. and so i get this invite thingie in my inbox yesterday, and so LIKE A DUMBASS i decide: \"oh okay. i should go and check it out.\"now-- REALLY NOW. sorry, but i don't \"do\" clubland anymore. i am 40 years old and the idea i should be anywheres but in bed with booboo at 1AM is totally fucking ludicrous to me. so when i get an \"invitation\" at an e-mail address that, quite frankly, i naively believe only TWO promoters in the world (amatullah and ronnie-madra) actually have-- i figure: \"yes okay i should go and support the peeps.\"yah so. the fucking things says 10PM on it, yes? so i decide to go immediately following dinner. 10:25pm.i am told: \"they're not ready yet\" by a seriously attatoody fuck at the door. some nice guy standing next to him offers to check the list, but then attatoody fuck says to him, \"no, there's no list tonight.\"what the fuck is the invitation for then, hmm ??so, in essence, i dragged a pretty prominent figure of the F&B industry to a club at 10:20pm when he would rather be home instead, just to be dissed at the door by some dumb attatoody mutherfukker. yah, it's pretty irritating, not to mention embarrassing.so, \"Greenhouse Family,\" whomever you are:SUCK IT. seriously.

While Michael Dorf busies himself with City Winery, his former venue the Knitting Factory is prepping for its relocation from Tribeca to Williamsburg. Unfortunately, almost his entire staff won't be coming with him. According to the NY Press, \"Only two of the 65 staff members-both managers-are being kept on. According to the bartender, the staff was told in April that they were being laid off en masse.\" That is rough. [NY Press]

***CONTENT
Last night, we had the pleasure of checking out Michael Dorf's City Winery, a brand new wine bar, restaurant, performance space and wine production facility all wrapped up into one large package. We were impressed with the space, the possibility of making our own barrel of wine (for $3000!), and an impressive list of musicians performing in an intimate setting. But we couldn't help but think something was off, with every service offered coming with a list of conditions to be able to partake. Some of the concepts include: It wasn't a place to eat and drink, but instead a place to drink great wine and eat. Get it? Anyone can attend the performances, as long as you join the Vinophile club. You and your friends can split a barrel of wine (~360 bottles worth), but the max group size is 7. Max. All of this sounds pretty good, but then you think about the average couple who just wants to have a glass of wine and get some food at 8:00 on a Thursday night. Due to all of these clubs and events, the chances of said couple being able to walk in hassle free seem slim. Not a good business model. Oh, and the subway rumbles underneath the restaurant every 10 minutes, making everything vibrate. City Winery is booked for private events through December, and Joan Osbourne will be playing there on New Years Eve for Vinophile club members. After that, it's open to the public. Sorta.

Though usually more the fare of our fave frenemy, the benefit circuit is decidedly New York. While it's hardly our area of expertise, it seems the fuss is a lot more about the parties than the causes. Not so on Friday night at the Museum of the City of New York where we braved the upper upper east side to support a friend in 3 Peaks 3 Weeks, an all-female organization that raises money for three key African charities, each one addressing health, education, and the environment. These women raise funds by pledging to climb the three highest peaks in Africa in under three weeks, a feat documented in a film premiered that evening that reminded revelers that the evening was about more than the bubbly and the canapes and the generally lackluster crowds. And we are rarely ones to turn down a chance to learn more about our fair city coupled with some decent wine and some pretty delicious canapes indeed.

Noah and Jason's planned takeover of the former Earth space got off to a good start last night, as Noah appeared before Community Board 4 to ask for a liquor license transfer. Grub Street braved the cold and the possibility of boredom to watch the meeting, and reports: Members of the board were sympathetic, conceding that the Roxy probably won't be making a comeback, praising Tepperberg for his micromanagement at Marquee, and even calling upon him, should he receive a license, to use his proven expertise to help control crowds at neighboring clubs. Also interesting is the confirmation that Cain did in fact want to relocate here until the CB let them know it was not an option, which led to the opening of Cain Luxe. Noah and Jason saw the opportunity for what it was, and rather than try to open a nightclub, they will keep it as a restaurant and change the vibe. Well played all around. The full board votes on December 3.

The list price for the Eldridge's eponymous cocktail is a steep $32, but for a cocktail made with Armand de Brignac and real gold sprinkles, isn't it worth it? Not according to ChiChi 212, who was a guest of the owner last Thursday night and was given one on the house. The outcome? Meh! The Chi says \"... it was delicious. But I was a tad disappointed. Now I don't know what I was expecting but for $32 I wanted a takeover of my tastebuds. But all I had was a tasty glass of champagne.\" Imagine how should we have felt if she had to pay? We recommend attending Champagne school so she can understand what it means to be given real Armand de Brignac. We mean, come on. It's Armand with gold flakes. Let's respect the cocktail here.

Breaking news from the Meatpacking District, where DBTH has learned that the Noah Tepperberg, Jason Strauss and the Strategic Group are poised to take over the space formerly occupied by Earth (Tenth Ave. between 17th and 18th), adjacent to the Park. According to a Little Birdy, the team plans to keep the 2500 SF operating as a restaurant and lounge with 2 full bars, good for a 299 person occupancy. The only changes will be cosmetic ones. Noah will be heading to meet with Community Board 4 tonight asking for their approval on the transfer of the existing liquor license. When asked to comment, Noah tells us that \"what you have heard it true and with 5 years of successful operating history in the neighborhood and a stellar reputation for 'delivering as promised,' we expect the Community Board and neighbors will welcome us to the block.\" Unlike the Alaska senatorial race, we expect to know the outcome by tomorrow morning. Stay tuned.

Yeah, SG is one of the very best at brand building - 1 Oak is nothing. Say what you want about the clientele, Marquee has made money hand over fist far longer than most of the clubs in the area (or in the whole city) and on the restaurant side they have the #1 and #5 highest grossing independent restaurants in the country! These guys know what they are doing. They aren't the typical club owner douchebags, their business includes corporate branding in \"real\" fields as well.

Lebowski Fest, the annual homage to the seminal Coen brothers film invaded Lucky Strike Lanes & Lounge on Sunday night. Sponsored by Kahlua (genius) and featuring dedicated White Russian bars, the evening featured bowling (natch) and costume and impersonation contests. The line stretched for two blocks to get in and had once again sold out in advance. The demand for caucasians was so intense that bartenders and servers could be seen running around with pitchers of the stuff. We think the best costume should have gone to the full In N Out crew or Arthur Digby Sellers, complete with iron lung. We don't know who ended up winning, because we had other places we had to be, but we assure you, the Chinaman was not the issue.

Upload an Image Couresty of GoaG After Bella's shutdown, we had heard rumors that the Martignetti boys were hoping the renovation would bring a whole new crowd to their Nolita basement. Their biggest cheerleader was, of course, GoaG, who proclaimed that \"The Martignettis have it down to a science\", touting that Southside now was complete with VIP booths and bottle service. Then tragedy struck, as our heroine attempted to drink away her crushing defeat. Apparently the bouncer told the group that buying a bottle was required, and the price was $1200. Our heroine was rightly incensed, but we can't help but chuckle at the whole thing. Southside was made out to be the greatest thing since DBTH, and then they go and disgustingly demand some serious scratch to be let inside. Goes to show that you really don't know who you're friends really are. That's why we will only spend time with our statue from now on.

I actually like this spot.. obviously every club in ny is not the same on the weekends that they are during the week.. try getting out on a weekday when its more of a local scene rather than trying to flood out the place on a friday or saturday. And of course they will try and get people to but 1200 dollar bottles, BEC ASSHOLES DO IT! Listen bottom line is every club is trying to create a certain look and feel.. so be smart about it, if your walking up with 5 of your boys wearing their best stripped shirts on a Friday night most likely your gonna get punted. Try getting a name drop, showing up with an even ratio of guys to girls or more and most likely you will get in... cmon people do i need to write a book about it? lol

The bottles do not cost $1200; that was probably just the table minimum spend.
hilarious

i actually witnessed the interaction between the doorman and guest of a guest while smoking outside. they tried bringing in a group of 12 people, including two tall ugly dudes were looked like identical twins. when the doorman said no. they said we will pay whatever you want to get in. the ddorman still said no because it was a shit crowd with busted chicks. they offered 1200 to get in and then anthony came out and said i wouldnt even let you in for 1500. then this weird twin dude started shouting that he owned guest of a guest and that he was going to ruin southside and that no one would ever come there after gofag deads the place. it was absolutely hilarious. than the other weird looking twin dude dragged him away. people were laughing their asses off because the friends they were trying to get in stayed and kept begging to get in. those twin dudes were the ugliest people i have ever seen no wonder they didnt get in

it wasnt because of rochelle that they didnt get into southside (i have no idea what she looks like, but am assuming she was one the subpar chicks that were with the earlier referenced \"ugly twins\"). i know who they are, went to harvard with them and was in another finals club. the one being a huge prick at the door was cameron wincklevoss, (which is no surprise because the kid is a huge tool) his brother tyler was actually trying to calm him down. there was probably 60-70 people outside and cameron keeps insisting to the doormen that he needs to bring his whole crew in, when the doorman deaded him, he started threatening that he would take his whole group to mansion or marquee, he was claiming that because he owns guest of a guest, rachelle would do whatever he said. he kept flying of the handle with standard rejected at a door rhetoric like \"do you know who i am\" \"i can buy this place\" \"i can have you shut down\".... anthony and the doormen were standing there encouraging him to write bad things about southside on guest of a guest. anthony actually told him \"please write bad shit about us, because we dont want your gay readers coming here\"... cameron has always been known to be a douche. in college he was disliked all over campus and is known as a huge spoiled brat, who gets really upset when he doesnt get what he wants. it was awesome to see him get shut down, especially when he tried to buy his way in.

With the current economic carnage, we couldn't help but wonder if this year's batch of New Years Eve extravaganzas would be greatly subdued. It turns out our inkling was correct. Not only did the SLA quietly change the permitting process for getting a special 8 AM license, only 39 NYC bars and clubs got their application in on time, with just 33 getting approval. That means a lot of all night revelers will be heading home at 4 AM or earlier, and promoters will be selling fewer $250 tickets for their competing \"parties of the year\". [NY Post]

If you read the article, you are quite wrong in that 33 of the permits have been approved. All it says is that 6 have so far been denied. From inside sources, it is expected that most of the other 33 permits will be denied as well. What a lame city this is turning into

Wow. Where to begin? Having to trek over to the far reaches of Club Row on a cold Sunday night was not an exciting prospect, but we threw on our hand tailored Duckie Brown suit (thanks!) and headed over to Mansion. When we arrived, the club was not quite ready for primetime, with the a massive crowd all looking to get inside. The door staff was not having it, but DBTH wasn't waiting either. We made our way inside and mingled in the front bar area until the main floor opened. 30 minutes later, it finally did. Hooray. It was like being at a really low brow version of the MTV Movie Awards. Really low brow. But still, we were given a table next to our friends from Lit Lounge and Mark Ronson, not shabby company. While we waited for the awards to start, we had the chance to catch up with some old and new friends. Rachelle swung by to say hello and invite DBTH to her dessert party. Uncle Steve came by and we had fun talking to him, hearing about his new gig and what he really thinks about things. We then had the chance to meet Matt Levine, which was fun, fun, fun! Fun! His cohort asked us to star in a movie, which we politely declined, and we took our seats and got ready for the show. Winners! The awards were as expected, numerous trannies and fake scenesters poorly reading categories and over-excited winners making bad acceptance speeches. The longer we were there, the less we wanted to be there. Then a Little Birdy whispered those sweet, sweet words to us. \"You won\". A feeling of warmth poured through us, knowing that our fans (and relatives) took the effort to vote for us. When it finally was annouced, our small group celebrated. No one else did. We made our way down to the main stage and were presented the Kid Robot designed award, which is special. Apparently our speech went unheard, but we thanked our competition, readers, and Matt Levine for giving us so much material. After that, we left to go celebrate. Matt was nice enough to invite us to the Eldridge, but we declined. We wanted to quietly savor the moment. Ahhh. Champions!

Times be tough in the New York hotel game, even for the most established of boutique joints.

Maybe we will call and get some prices for our winter 2009 DBTH Fanclub Convention. Maybe.

Hotel Gansevoort doesn't deserve any loyalty from the city. When they built this out-of-scale, out-of-character lump in one of the city's more charming neighborhoods, they showed New Yorkers what they thought about us. Now is your time to tell Gansevoort what we think of their attitude. - I say let the dump find the fate it deserves in the bankruptcy courts.

So, we've got a question here at DBTH HQ that needs to be answered: What is so damn 'green' about Greenhouse? Is it a member of the GRA? That body helps restaurants, bars and nightclubs use green practices and provides guidelines for waste, approved cleaning agents, etc. If it is, then what guidelines is it using? Is it LEED certified? We doubth that. Has Jon B. purchased wind energy credits to offset Greenhouse's carbon footprint? So, what is it? The fake ivy outside has us pretty skeptical. Any little birdies out there that know what is green about Greenhouse, please chime in in the comments section. We are really interested to know, and if Greenhouse is just a green gimmick, then... And no, LED lighting does not qualify.

PROOF of this being SHELTERS LICENSE!!! READ JOHN BESTGetting Set for ‘06It’s a Wide World of Nightlife, and Music’s in MotionWow 2005. What a ride, huh? For those of you in the biz out and about this past year, shakin’ it all night long, it has been an ear-thumping, sensory experience for the most part, to be sure. Nearly every night of the week someone somewhere was pushing the envelope from big-name DJs, to some great new discoveries in the realm of live bands. We owe a big round of applause to all you in the industry who were willing to go out on a limb, risk a little revenue and breed a little artistic cultivation. And to all of you who merely turned on the satellite radio and got by with the easy listening blasé background stuff, well — there’s always 2006!For this look back and complementary look ahead, Nightclub & Bar asked a few in the industry how they felt about the past 12 months, and — despite the fact that clandestine psychic abilities were not a prerequisite for the interviews — we asked them what they saw for the next 12 on the calendar as well.DJs at Play “I actually think it has slowed down a bit,” Billy Dec, president of Rockit Ranch Productions and owner of Le Passage, in Chicago, says of the power of the DJ movement this year. “Thankfully,” he adds, “because rates and hype were simply getting out of control. The cost in no way could be justified by the demand, especially when considering capacity issues in a venue. You can’t fit that many people in a place to make sense of paying outrageously high rates. I also think the market in general has appreciated what’s been offered through the mainstream to the point that the music they want can be heard by more random DJs.” While it seems everyone on the planet was clambering to either see a DJ or be a DJ in 2005, the rates became astronomical. Big names were asking as much as $20,000 for one show, and many in the industry were pushed to broaden the spotlight to include some lesser-known names. “I have seen an increasing interest in celebrity DJs, like ex-rockers now spinning, DJs in tabloids that are not necessarily known for what they spin, but for who they are. This has boomed this year in popularity,” Dec says.Live and Kickin’Hip-Hop gave a little slice of the pie to its stepchild, Reggaeton, in 2005, but in the live music household, there were constant squabbles for the spoils. “I think there is a still a market for it,” John Best, manager of Club Shelter in New York City, says. “But, I think it has dwindled, with the record sales and the ipod.” http://www.nightclub.com/NCB_Magazine/NCB_December_2005/2005_Trends/

What dont you get????? anyone that owns more than 10% of a business that sells booze must be on the SLA license. So this MEANS THAT JON B either OWNS nothing or they are Operating with no active SLA license. What do you think??? also if they make any changes to the SLA license they must go in front of the Community Board to do so, and they have NOT done so. IS THIs CLEAR ENOUGH????

So Greenhouse had it's long awaited debut last night, but according to one LB, the place wasn't quite ready for primetime. Our Birdy tells us: So, I just got home from Greenhouse (aka Guesthouse), IT WAS A MESS. It was one of the most unorganized openings I have ever seen, when I walked in their were leaves falling from the wall, the bar wasn't even set up, they were still drilling, painting, and it was a mess! As I start to walk around, I see every promoter in NYC at every table, hosting. Using promoters at your grand opening? Wow, not a good look. Then, as I walked around, I found out, that Bill Spector (from SMAC) is a partner, so let's see Barry from Stereo, Jon B from Home/Guesthouse, and Bill Specter from Highline Ballroom/Glo, etc = BRIDGE & TUNNEL. Is there any hope for Greenhouse to be successful? Karim is their only hope, but even his table was 17 year old girls. I give it 2 months before Richie Romero takes over Saturdays. It really is unfortunate, the place had potential, but it is Home Part 2 (same door staff, same waitress staff, same people, different name, different club). It doesn't really sound like fun to us, and according to the Post, isn't as green as Jon B. makes it out to be. But the space isn't even officially open yet, so we aren't quite willing to call the tombstone engraver quite yet. Greenhouse Coverage [DBTH]

it was horrible, set-up is horrible, you can't even walk around the tables, its like the raised platform at tenjune, but with even a littler walkway, so not fun, actually annoying to navigate in there.

::sigh:: You bloggers are ruthless. Half of the people criticizing probably didn't even go last night and the half who did had a good time. The DJ was amazing the place looks great when it was finished being built lol. It was supposed to be a soft opening. The grand is next thursday. I don't mind you bombing the club after next thursday but not after the first soft opening.

was there last night expecting to see good things. i am industry person and think that something new downtown, especially with the capability to do large events would be a bonus to the neighborhood. greenhouse was in fact shockingly bad. i saw a horribly run door, with the same gay doorman, a terribly laid out nightclub with no flow, energy or focussed dancing area. the promoters were bogus, highly paid and they didnt even come through with any of the top girls, or any bottle buyers. the most dissappointing though was the lack of design, and lack of expense in putting together whatever shitty design they had. i am amazed that a place like this is even thought by the owners that it can compete with anyone downtown, from santos, to southside, and beatrice to goldbar. people are not going to be fooled. as for how in fact it is green, i am personally clueless. cheers

I was there last night and it was really fun. The space looks pretty cool (though a little overkill on the leafy-ness), but I spoke to one of the managers who told me that the leaves are actually real leaves, preserved - so they are def not plastic. I heard also that they are going for LEED certification (whatever that is), but don't know if they have it yet. They did a little tutorial on the space with me, the walls are bamboo, the bathrooms are low water usage, and something about the lights, I think they are low consumption electricity lights?
FOR REAL
2008-11-14 10:43:00
I was there last night and I am not a hater. However it wasn't great. In this business a soft opening means that if it sucks you can say the real opening is the following week so don't judge me now. The crowd was strong at times. A lot of Girls. A Lot of industry heads. However I agree with a poster above, The door was run poorly, the flow is terrible. When I walked in at midnight they were still doing construction. In fact you couldn't enjoy the open bar that was going on because there was no bar. they were still building it. I have been in nightlife for almost half my life. I have seen place opened that were not finished. I have never seen a bar being built with a few hundred people already in the room. The space is very dark when the lights are off. It almost looks dirty when the lights and crystals are off. when they are on the space looks much better but then the room is too bright and loses any energy.Greenhouse has a lot of people with a lot of experience behind them. Jon B has a checkbook that he is not afraid to use. In the end Karim will keep it hot a couple nights a week. after that the masses will be there and Karim will most likely make the downstairs ultra exclusive but, the main room will be nothing special.I wish them the best

Jon B.!!! What were you thinking!!? Karim is the kiss of death. He has single-handedly murdered every establishment that he has ever been apart of.This place is fucked..

I think the guys behing this joint are dellusional. NO PROMOTERS. Are you kidding me? Ok let me give you a little reminder of all the promoters who called me, TXT me and emailed me that night who were not hanging out  for fun. They were getting a big check from Mr.JB(Karim, Barry M and John Cantor, Scott Hockens, Michael James (called me 5 times), Nema, Darwin, Franceso Belcaro+++++++ tons of other guys who I have never seen but had comp bottles on their table so I am assuming they are promoters) Why lie? Promoters are ok that is how I got to your stupid place to begin with. The door was a mess and the flow sucks. Half of the promoters told me they know it is horrible but are only doing it for money. karim told me he is getting paid 3k a week just to use his name but most of the time he wont be there he will be at Megu.
Jonb
2008-11-14 17:15:00
Barry M and John Cantor .....HAHAHHAHA NemaHAHAHHA, Darwin HAHAHAH. Greenhouse does not PAY THEM as much as you think. First of all they are NOBODYS and I only know them because I used to be involved with Shelter. Those guys get paid per head. and they do 50 people between all of them so GreenHouse is not losing anything!!! also its just a matter of time before the URBAN world comes back to my SHELTER . hahahhahah

I was at the soft opening last week. I make my rounds in this city and Greenhouse will now be checked off my list. WORST CROWD. What happened to soft openings just being for close friends/family and your top clients Funny to think this place needs promoters on the first night. It's worse than Guesthouse...which i didn't think was possible. Sorry guys, but i don't think \"being green\" will get you guys by...but then again, the bridge and tunnel need a place to go too.

I'm not sure why everyone has to bag on Jersey so much, what did we ever do to you. Anyway, I went to opening night, they let my group in right away as we were all girls. I have to say it was pretty disappointing my local Jersey bar has a better looking crowd. As far as \"don't hate\" posting, everyone seems to concur, Greenhouse isn't cutting it.

Last night, DBTH et al ventured down to Elsa, the new cocktail lounge and bar in the former Hanger Bar space on 3rd Street and Avenue B, that was hosting a friends and family opening night . After making our way through the greeting vestibule and into the main room, we had to rub our eyes to get adjusted to the place. Gone is the dingy divey decor that was Hangar, replaced with a total whitewash of warmth that seemed to transport you out of the East Village and to some far off corner of Brooklyn. In fact, everything about it screamed Brooklyn, from the DIY decor to the crowd and music. But we were smack dab in the middle of Alphabet City. Elsa had arranged some cheese and crackers for everyone, which were lovely, and we saddled up to the bar to enjoy a Jaszek Cocktail (Applejack, Velvet Falernum, Lime Juice, Bitters), named after its creator Kevin Jaszek, who also bartends at Freemans. Overall, we give the place high marks for its coziness, music, and inventive cocktail list, even if we think offering guests the \"Perfect Manhattan\" is a wee bit presumptuous. We also loved to see the crown moldings lining the ceiling. Elsa is too small to result in big things, but we predict that it will become a much loved neighborhood hang in an area that is full of forgettable bars overrun with weekenders. Or maybe they will overrun it too. More pictures after the jump! Elsa Cocktail El Romero Borracho cocktail The Jaszek Cocktail List

In Mountain House, California, 90% of the homeowners are reported to be underwater. This means that 90% of all Mountain House homeowners owe more money on their mortgage than their homes are actually worth. That's no good. The housing bubble burst has decimated the entire town, and the carnage can be seen in abandoned homes that have been foreclosed on and vacant retail spaces that were once filled with national chain outlets. But despite the financial carnage, the good folks of Mountain House have refused to give up drinking. While purchasing a $24 bottle of petite sirah, Ray Lopez, a database administrator, explains \"\"My house is underwater, so I'm not doing too much impulse shopping or any renovation. But I'm not cutting back on this. Life is too short.\" Ray, we are with you 1000%, but might it behoove you to find something a bit less pricey? If you are going bust, you could stretch your booze dollar pretty far if you put your mind to it. We're just saying. [NYT]

We have heard that 3 people have already had excitement related heart palpitations, and who could blame them. This place has been buzzing for years and on multiple continents. But will it live up to the hype? Does anything? Of course not, but who really cares?

prediction
2008-11-11 14:46:00
Jon B = HOME & GUESTHOUST, ST. LOUIS Home.My predication is that he will pay good promoters for the first month (like he did with Home), and then open up the floodgates, and be bridge and tunne; (it is down the block from Holland Tunnel). I suggest go checking it out now with the promoters before in 3 months it is GUIDOFEST.
Sweet 16
2008-11-11 14:47:00
I agree with Prediction, Cain tried to re-create Cain Luxe, now Jon B is moving Home downtown. Just because you hire Karim, Barry from Stereo, and a few promoters doesn't change your image, and your crowd. Greenhouse has been blasting out emails about booking for private events for a month. I am willing to bet we see it on the next episode of Sweet 16.

This place looks like crap, the concept just does not really work for the nightclub industry. As much as I would love to see this world go green I dont see how you can really make a nightclub environmentally friendly. As for Cain, it's a pretty great new layout, I have only been once since it's new opening and was very impressed. They did have a much tighter door but are still open to anyone buying bottles. Great crowd inside and seemed a little less b&t at the door. We will see how long it lasts, Cain was always good though.

Barry is a c minus promoter and Karim was fired from Cipriani. Great team guys! I was there on wednesday (soft opening) I was invited by my friend Scott he is a promoter there. I can tell you it is already down hill. They could have at least waited three weeks to make it Getho and cheezyyyyyyyyyyy. Oh well, I am all about green but there is nothing green about this place except a bunch of tugs soking pot next to my table.

Halloween has come and gone. Next up is New Year's Eve, famous for its lavish parties with expensive up front costs, open bars, champagne toasts and hired celebrities. Or if you are really making it pop, you head to St. Barts, Miami or some other warm locale to combine the party with a tan. But in the current economy, with layoffs pending and a general sense of doom all around, will NYE 2008 be relatively quiet? Have you either skipped making or cancelled your plans? Or is NYE too important to skip? Comments are open!

Everyone knows NYE in NY (assuming you're out in public) is as big a shit-show as there is. Find a cool house party or two or get out of town. I've had great times in Reykjavik, Barcelona, and Punta del Este in the past. The key is going someplace foreign enough that you don't realize that NYE is \"amateur night\" everywhere.

Feeling pinched by the economic times and looking for a place to cut loose on the cheap? Those crazy kids at Cooper 35 understand that times are tough and want to help. To help ease your pain, they have created a Bail Out Happy Hour, with $3 specials all night. At least we think that's what that says. We are not sure if that covers grape vodka and Sprite, but there is only one way to find out.

In preparation for tonight's Whiskey Fest 2008, the folks from Woodford Reserve Bourbon's hosted a little shimmy at Apotheke to show off their Master's Collection. We chatted, we laughed, we learned. Most importantly, we slurped down a few Fallen Leaves, a delicious cocktail made with Woodford infused with bay leaves, house bitters, agave nectar, fresh lime and a bay leaf-rubbed rim. The recipe just worked.

Courtesy of NY Times What do you do with a roof bar once the weather turns cold? Greg Brier is dealing with this very problem at Highbar, a smash success this summer. But, you know, it like doesn't have a roof, so the changing seasons are going to have a direct impact on Greg's business model. Not to worry, the roof will remain open through the winter, covered by a \"a transparent tent with heat lamps\". In addition, guests will have access to a \"sleek penthouse lounge one level below the rooftop, with floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking Eighth Avenue\". It obviously won't be the same, but the Highbar folks hope it will sustain them until the warm weather returns. Chances of a massive Hello Spring party? 100% [NY Times] A Little Birdy was in Soho Thursday night and walked upon the scene that is Origine. The report? Shit show. According to our LB, \"there was an overflow crowd pouring onto Spring Street, and you could hear Naughty By Nature at level 11. Heavy B&T.\" Well, everyone needs to have fun, but we can't imagine the residents appreciate a full fledged nightclub operating in what was meant to be a restaurant. We give this one 3 months before the community crushes it out of existence. [DBTH] Winter means cocktails to warm the spirit. The back bar at Freemans whpped us up a Dark Rum Mojito, which did indeed give us a warm, tingly feeling inside after just coming in from the cold. Delicious. Just in time for Veteran's Day, two versions of the MacArthur cocktail. One is rum based, the other made with brandy. There really are cocktails for every occassion. [WSJ]

David Jaffee wears many hats. Banker, promoter, ladies man. And just like you, he is susceptible to the dips in the economy. Steve Lewis caught up with the Jaff, who seems to be a bit confused over which of his two chosen professions, Banking or Nightlife, offers him the most lucrative opportunity in this crazy world. Jaff says there are positives and negatives to both, but to him \"nightlife is more reliable\". You get paid in seven days or [I] just close shop and move the party to one of a hundred competitors. It's easy to move around, and there are no human resource department bureaucracies or entanglements. It's OK, let's try it; bang-it works, we do it again, or else I move on.\" So will he move on? The Jaff worries that an Obama administration will make London and Dubai even stronger against the US, but that doesn't mean he is giving up. He will just keep trying to make it happen here, and we heart him for it.

OH I sleep with models, I even turn them down, client first blah blah blah its a load of shit. This type of guy no offense he might be cool is the reason nightlife is such a joke...you work in finance the most soul-less job out there no culture or class for the most part and then you go out and buy bottles (you are buying a 900 bottle of champagne buddy why not take that model bird or girl your obsessed with to Miami for the night...its really just incredible and these \"high end cool night clubs are all the same..ya its based on supply and demand for bottles but its the same 10 djs spinning in more or less the same square or rectangle...if you are cool or cultured you will actually know the alternative spots to meet like-minded ppl..this is not to say you cannot go to 10ak or somewhere for a great 18 dollar whiskey and some stupid girls...(ill need 100 vicodin and 5 bourbons please)

Actually, to be clear, I don't think that the Obama administration will make NYC lose its competitive advantage, rather I feel that the lack of savings by American consumers, overall Government corruption & interference, tremendous greed and arrogance by people in the financial services industry, our huge government debt which will further deflate the dollar, and massive inflation will all serve as SIGNIFICANT overhang to the overall US economy. Since NYC is heavily dependent on finance income, then it'll undoubtedly be hit the hardest.I'm lucky to still have a finance job considering what some of my friends have gone thru.Personally, I think Obama is a great man but can one man overhaul an entire corrupt institution - the U.S. Government? Unfortunately I don't think that's possible because Politicians tend to be very selfish and will not pass legislation that is detrimental to their own personal interests.

I think deflation is a larger risk to our economy than inflation. Thankfully, so do our central bankers. When you have the super hawkish ECB cutting rates as aggresively as they are, and Trichet saying to expect another cut (or very nearly that, anyhow), inflation is clearly not the risk. http://money.cnn.com/2008/11/06/news/deflation.fortune/index.htm

He'd be asleep at 10pm after a long hard days work. You just dont want to do anything else after working hard. Unless he's got an easy day job. He might work in the corporate world but he's a slacker who sits back and lets others do his work. He might spend his days on the web surfing and blogging about being Tony Manaro.

Oh wait I know...because you promote Mantra and Pop Burger (see website) All the models go there..fo sho. Its very clear now...haha. Skin Flute Tuesdays and Trombone Party Thursdays at Eldridge with Jaffee and Levine. Next up maybe he'll promote Citrine. Bwaha.oh..and myspace friends?

I have no problem taking full responsibility if i've done something wrong, as i'm far from perfect, but if you're gonna make stuff up & lie then at least have it semi-accurate.

Citrine sucks. I've been dragged there three times now, and the scenario has remained the same. I have yet to see a crowd maintained at this tiny establishment. You would think, with such small square footage, that it would be easy to fill that place up, But I have yet to see more than 50 people at a time there. I was there last night and by 2:00, the place was a ghost town. There were maybe 10-12 people in there.This place was over before it even started. Hopefully the same will not happen to Greenhouse, but sadly I think the times of the bottle table is over. It had it's run, and it was good, but i think the era of cheap drinks, cheap clothes and expensive drugs will be making a huge come-back. Maybe the \"Club kids\" will take back the throne, and make new york fun again. It'll be a nightlife renaissance.

Is the Hotel Era Over?

No one enjoyed the construction boom more than the hotel industry. Cheap loans and an influx of tourists taking advantage of a weak dollar created a hotel construction bonanza that may never be seen here again, with visitors barely batting an eye at room prices pushing $500 a night. But the pending recession and expected drop off of international visitors will probably end the construction boom, and the number of glitzy hotel openings is about to wrap up. So is there anything left to be excited for? Our friends at Curbed tackled the soon to open Cooper Square and semi-opened Thompson LES this week (complete with Andy Warhol pool). Then there is the still under construction Mondrian NYC, Gansevoort Park Ave, and the star studded Ace Hotel, which is gunning for a February 1st unveiling. But after that, the good times may indeed be over. Industry experts tell us that City has never had so much inventory, which was great when every Irish person with a passport was willing to shell out $400 a night. But expect rates to soften and vacancies and weekend specials to increase, as operators hope to generate enough revenue to pay off their debt load. And if that happens, expect developers to unload property or hold off until the residential market strengthens, at which time they can make a move to greener and more lucrative pastures.

Our good friends at Urban Daddy provide the scoop on RDV (short for Rendevouz), a new lounge which has opened beneath Bagatelle on 13th Street in the Meatpacking District. According to the Daddy, \"breeze into RDV and you'll feel like you've walked into an elegant turn-of-the-century European hotel. Mismatched antique couches abound for you to pick your seating poison-leather, cow fur, velvet or Thai silk ... Potted green palm trees and golden framed mirrors set the mood for late-night candlelit debauchery... and maybe a game of chess. Better yet, make that foosball-they've got an antique table awaiting your sensitive touch.\" The best part could be ordering Dom by the glass. The worst part (for you at least) is it's still only open for private parties and you have to call Kiss and Fly to Make one. Boo hoo. But they will be letting you in soon enough - unless the Community Board finds out about it first.

At just 28, Daniel Squadron is one of the youngest candidates ever elected to the New York State Senate. So why is this young buck considered to be the greatest threat to New York City nightlife since Prohibition? Squadron's has proposed numerous changes to the current the liquor license application process, and seeks to make local Community Board's reccomendations a binding judgement on applications as well as create \"SLA Community Enforcement Teams\" for new \"High Density Residential Zones\" to keep nightlife's impact on residents to a minimum. Despite what you think of these ideas, the question now is what chances do a Junior State Senator from Brooklyn have of getting this legislation passed? Since the State is about to go through another painful round of budget cuts, and property owners are going to continue looking for tenants to fill empty retail spaces, it seems that this may not be a top priority for veteran legislators. But if somehow it does pass, we only hope that the Senator, who we know and like, makes himself available to attend each and every meeting of his local Community Board to make sure that potential operators are given a fair shake.

I'm glad you posted about this. The nightlife folks hate Squadron's proposal for a lot of reasons, but i think mainly because of the lack of objective criteria they can work at meeting (not decibel levels, but the impressions of cops walking by on the street as to noise). His proposed rule is just \"keep some more people happy\". It will be very hard for people to invest in a business which faces such capricious regulation, and in a recession its not the direction we should be going.

I only heard about Squadron the day before the election. His position seemed to take a lot of bar and club operators by surprise. If he's only 28 and he plans to stay in politics we're going to have to deal with this guy for a long time unless we get him out. The SLA already gives substantial weight to CB decisions, there are already dozens of other things operators have to contend with to keep a good place open. What does he gain by making New York a bedroom community? How many votes can he get when a few misguided people can go to sleep early on a Saturday night? The nightlife community needs to focus on getting him out of office or at least suppressing his negative agenda.

Well, it's finally over and there was no shortage of election viewing parties all over the city. CNN called it early at 11pm meaning most of us who were out could celebrate confidently. A little birdy checked in from Brooklyn reporting that 'Flatbush was off the chain'. Awesome. We ended up right in the middle of the Meat at Tenjune. Interestingly, Chicago's third biggest celebrity behing the two O's was not at Grant Park, but holding down the fort at Tenjune. That's right- His Royal Airness was in the house. God bless America!

AvroKo's Double Crown and Madam Geneva opened to great fanfare in September of this year, but could this project be the first miss after the design firm's lengthy string of extra base hits? Double Crown has been rocked with several bad reviews, and it appears to have taken a toll on business. A Little Birdy snapped this photo of the space last night, saying \"this is the back room at Double Crown last night at 7:00. Empty. The main room had a few tables eating, but it was basically dead.\" Our LB goes on to say that the restaurants across the street (Quartino, Bianca, Von) and Gemma were fairly crowded, leading us to believe that Double Crown's concept has not caught on, and we could see an overhaul soon.

7pm on a Monday downtown after the huge Halloween weekend? That's a ridiculous time to judge the success of a place. Are you kidding?! The real story that you should be covering is the FANTASTIC opening party that Double Crown threw late on Sunday night following the earlier party at sister venue Public (to celebrate their Michelin Star win) when 100s of regulars and friends packed out the place to celebrate the venue's stellar opening. Instead you post this grainy pic? This story looks foolish to any of the people who were at that party.The double venue all-out party was testament to the ongoing success this venue will enjoy. The staff hosted a masked street parade at 10.30pm on Sunday night from Public to Double Crown - with flame throwers and fire twirlers leading all the guests to join in the fun. Once inside the venue the staff were dressed as aristocrats - champagne & pimms cups flowed (along with delicious treats like oysters and marshmallows) all night as fans of the venues partied. Marie Antoinettes sat eating cake and pouring champagne from silver tea pots into the guests' gold rimmed porcelain tea cups for the hundreds of guests. A picture might tell a 1000 words but yours is way off mark and not even well shot.

I haven't eaten here yet, but I will say that I live in the neighborhood and I don't care who said any places are busy at 7pm, they aren't. Gemma is a ghost town until 8:30.The other places noted never seem busy, except for Von which gets packed only late. Might want to check your source on this one. This neighborhood is not for early diners.

Cocktails are one area in which we are firm believers that \"less is more\". But in today's high stakes world of mixology, cockatil chefs are constantly striving to one up each other, using exotic ingredients and wild combinations to create a signature drink menus to put their bar or name on the map. But are the results worth the effort? In NoCal, Scott Beattie of Cyprus felt a need to push the limits of his cocktail menu to compete with the chef's award winning dishes. The result is visually stunning cocktails made with ingredients ranging from shredded dianthus petals, pickled fennel and shiso leaves. But does it all amount to putting lipstick on a pig? The beauty of a drink is most often in it's simplicity, a simple shot (or two) of a quality spirit in a glass. Classic cocktails often invovle less than 5 ingredients, and the best have remained popular with revelers for centuries. We admire Beattie's creativity, and would love to saddle up to a pitcher of his Painful Punch, but we long for simpler times when we could get a rum punch without having to wait for someone to toast spices and simmer with fresh squeezed fruit juices for 30 minutes. If it does tickle your fancy, then you should check out Beattie's new book Artisinal Cocktails and spend an evening making them for yourself at home.

Got your plans set yet? This little birdy will be at the MGMT show in Brooknam. We hear the after party is at Southside. So here is one last flyer follies for Halloween. There has been a lot of chatter about this one. With Noah, Jason and Upstairs czar Danny A promoting this, I htink we all know how it will end up. Interesting turn that Lucky Strike has taken (and probably a smart one) to get nightlife promoters on their new venues. Tommy Pooch did a weekly at Lucky Strink in Miami and now this. I guess they're hoping the Strategic crew can do to Lucky Strike what they did for Tao.

And here we have The Eldridge. This flyer is a real head scratcher. First of all, a bunch of astute little birdies sent this over the wires to us. And, they all remarked how surprised they were to receive it, since they were not titanium-engraved-blinged-out-hand-etched vip card carrying peeps. They didn't even know how they got on The Eldridge list. Is the most exclusive club in the Milky Way Galaxy open to the entire bourgeois and not just Tom Cruise and his friends? It would certainly seem so. But, what had our guys down at the crime lab even more confused was that The Eldridge seems to have already broken a major promise faster than Barack Obama decided against using federal campiagn financing. Pre-opening, owner Matt Levine was telling anyone who would listen about the groundbreaking philosophies behind The Eldridge (butlers, not busboys!): NY Mag: Why not stay open on weekends? ML: Everyone I know goes away on the weekends. I wanted to keep it New York. I just thought as far as the vibe goes, the people who go to the Eldridge, they're not in the city on weekends. So I'm closing the weekends. So, by that rationale, The Eldridge is not keeping it New York. If none of the people who go to The Eldridge are here on weekends, then who is going to The Eldridge? This can only mean they're keeping it Jersey. Or Staten Island. On weekends, at least. Represent. However, if you do feel inclined to keep it New York during the week, click ahead for tonight's Eldridge event. This is the afterparty for the Masquerade Ball at 1OAK that ends suspiciously early. Hasn't she already hosted The Eldridge like 5 times already? Anyway...

That whole closing on the wknd. thing came about when Matt thought he'd have the place up and running in the summer. He always planned to eventually be open on the wknds. That's the problem when you run your mouth before you get things off the ground. It really is amazing how much promotion they feel compelled to do...for a place that is barely bigger than my tenement apt's loo?!

Lydia didn't actually write that about throwing parties during this economy because she doesn't \"write\" her column for Page Six, they just put her picture at the top of the page. She's since disavowed that column. Apparently she learned the hard way that lending your name and picture to vouchsafe for any random thing they put in front of you can make you look foolish!

Matt's got a good publicist and does a good job himself. Unfortunately I haven't made it over there despite the fact that I have that nice card. I do hear pretty good things. DBTH did bash this place pretty hard and it seems like they were wrong.
Just making an observation...
2008-10-30 23:57:00
FOR REAL, obviously DBTH bashed on The Eldridge...it bashes on EVERYTHING, that's how pathetic this blog is (and yes, i read the blog because it's entertaining) but it's the least credible blog in the world. All this guy Scott did was put up a blog, talk shit about everything, give promoters/owners an outlet to bad mouth eachother and BOOM. Almost 99.9% of the blogs out there can give credit where credit is due and even give somewhat factual information. DBTH is awful and painful and basically stands for everything that is pathetic.

The photos they post on GoaG are so embarrassing. There are like 10 ugly people trying to spread out to fill an empty room. Eldridge will never be El Bano.

2008-10-31 10:15:00
DBTH, don't hate because you can't get into The Eldridge, but hey, keep on talking about The Eldridge, they don't use promoters, and never will, but you guys are their #1 fan, keep talking about The Eldridge, its like free advertising and promotion for them.
DJ's / crazy
2008-10-31 10:16:00
Can anyone here name a better DJ line-up? DBTH, you should start a poll about that. The Eldridge DJ line-up is sick. Dalton spun their last night as well, all models, all celebrities, it was crazy.

2008-11-04 17:05:00
The promoters weren't getting paid, just friends. Thanks though, there was about 40 people there Chris Martin from Coldplay and all the dancers and staff from the box closing it down. We had Jesse ripping tunes who is a the nastiest young DJ around, I hope you left early because you weren't welcome anyway. We chill on Mondays with our friends, all good.

An astute little birdy who begs to differ with our analysis of Citrine last week has come through on her promise to send us a video of what she proclaimed was the new club 'going off'. In our effort to be fair and balanced, we decided to upload this video through the system of tubes that is the internet (sorry Ted). So, here it is. Judge for yourself.

I disagree, whenever Journey is thrown on at 230 in the morning after a few drinks it always leads to a fun time. Citrine looks great, I am looking forward to hitting it up.

After finally making it to Citrine last night i was impressed. By far the hottest girl ratio I've seen in a club in new york in a long time. The venue itself has a great feel to it. Perfect size and layout. great place to pickup. The guys behind this got a winning combo. I see great things for this place.

The Creators of LA PLAYA in the Hamptons are the people that bring you CITRINE. WHAT A FAILURE!!!! and they were talking the same amount of shit when La Playa opened. 3 weeks in La Playa FAILED. Citrine, Failure is around the corner.
Bobbyrick the Promoter / Owner
2008-10-29 12:14:00
Bobbyrick. Which Promoter are you? Such a promoter post. I read this site everyday and I know a promoter when I read one.I think there should be 2 new rules on DBTH. If you are making a comment on a venue, you have to have gone there at least once. I have not been so I have no comment. My bet is of the 9 comments only 1 person has been to Citrine and 1 works there. The other posters are pissed off that their boss at their 65K a year job is a DB. i understand that.Second rule is that any person who is a promoter or owner should have to identify themselves. If you have the balls to rip any person or place, at least do it in the open. That door guy Aalex was a total DB in his Blackbook interview but, at least he didn't hide behind some BS handle like Bobbyricky.i think it is unfair that Rickybobby says anyone was talking shit. I don't remember any shit talking from Citrine or La Playa for that matter. By opening is that talking shit. I could be wrong but, I think those guys who did La Playa also did Pink Hamptons - which was the best spot out there. Not sure. Correct me if I am wrong.All the shit talking is from the other Promoters / Owners and angry bloggers. The EndScott

i will say, that video doesn't do that night justice, there was a consistent hour towards the end of the night where the dj began to kill a house set like i've never heard, if people have video of that they should put it up. don't stop believing is quite cheese, but it seems to work so, if its too boring for you i suggest heading somewhere else to feed your musical hunger bc i can guarantee you more than half of new york nightlife is not based on the music anymore. so good luck with that.

2008-10-29 16:42:00
Just so we're all on the same page, the ugly freak homo that's behind this website (who probably got beat up in highschool) is Scott Solish. Here, take a look, http://nymag.com/images/2/daily/food/08/03/21_solish_lgl.jpg . The guy looks like my ass after taco bell and a long walk in the desert. Who the hell is he to bad mouth a nightclub? Guys a poser with a blog that cost about $10.00 to design/develop. The reviews should be written by professionals (credible people that are in the service/nightlife industry) - freedom of speech is all good but there needs to be a line. What good is reading a review if it's written by some jackass who has probably never left his basement studio apartment in hoboken?

Kingadrock I agree- Literally go into any \"models and bottles\" type place in the city and it's the same fucking thing. don't get me wrong it's fun for a few hours but let's be serious here. none of these new places are ground breaking. they just make the door more exclusive so everyone buys into it. i don't care if a club was in the middle of a fucking crack house-if there's some jerkoff doorman and a few hot chicks the place will generate a buzz (i.e. upstairs)Tap tap that bed to the wall!! (sorry listening to MIA)

I do not Particularly like Mike Satsky who owns LILY POND, and I find him to be a dick and a bigger dick when he is outside shitting on everyone screaming at fat girls and ugly people. But I have to speak the HONEST TRUTH. Lily Pond was the best place in the Hamptons with Hottest Girls by far. anyone that claims anything less is a Hating Lier.
LilyPond is not a good club
2008-10-30 15:36:00

HI HATER! Ive been to Citrine once and I dont know what any of you are talking about. Come with girls, you're getting in. Lots of gorgeous girls, great girl to guy ratio, and the same music they play at all this spots, nice mix of hip hop and rock. Place stayed bumping until closing, what else could you ask for. If you come with all guys, of course you are going to have a problem, places like this cant stay open if they let every guy in the city in. Negative responses are from people that got rejected or hate on the owners/promoters.
Are u serious!!!!!???

This city has turned soft, losing its authenticity.. and im originally from staten island, now city bound... but no way in hell youll ever find me at Home, Guest House, Marquee, Meatpacking, Libations, or any of those other Bridge and Tunnel clubs partying with your boy DMI Mikie with his hollow chain from canal st and perfectly sculpted eyebrows. These crowds are jokes nowadays.. And Jaffee if you can make money off of it then hey more power to you.. i know your a business man. Im just making a statement im sure most of you are already familiar with.

It's that time of year again. Temps in the 60's + Friday night + Halloween = Debauchery on the streets of NYC. Those of you who remember Halloween '03 will recall the madness that is a weekend night Halloween with balmy fall temps in the city. There are sure to be parties galore, so let's get a Halloween event list going in the comments section. As always, if you've got a hot event, you know where to send it.

Despite a week of ho-hum new club openings and general douchbaggery, there is a silver lining. The new Cain (aka Cain Luxe) re-opened last night. Pity Citrine for poor scheduling of their grand opening. Word is that the prior documented new design has been very well-received (the old design was pretty nice, too). Spotted in the crowd showing clubland solidarity and support were reps from the Tenjune and Bijoux crews, among others. Teaser site is up, as well, in all its flash-tastic Bob Sinclar glory. Cain NYC

2008-10-24 18:31:00
was there last nite as well. Many heavy hitters. Was good to see mark cuban roll in at 3am with a bevy of models. It was rockin even with the fire alarm going off and shutting things down for 10 minutes. However at 3am the place was 25% full and is more indicative of how it will look when the hoopla dies down. We can't be wriiten up on pg 6 everyday. Definitely seemed to be more of a 100k renovation than a million dollar renovation.
teabiscuit
2008-10-24 22:46:00
Fair point doc -- I think 25% is a little low, closer to 50% at 3 am.But it was crowded mad early and people did bolt because of the fire alarm. It is too early to tell how sticky the buzz is, that's certainly the question, but objectively they had a big night.
FOR REAL
2008-10-25 03:17:00
50% at 3 a.m. on a thursday isn't so bad. I think most owners would kill for that.i have heard mixed reviews about the redesign.

2008-10-25 12:43:00
I went last night, and it was horrible, I saw almost every promoter I knew, and every promoter girl I knew, and an occasional wall street banker, and there was no way 1 million dollars in renovation, if I had to guess, I would say 75k at most!

Was at Cain Luxe for the opening and also last night, it was packed to capacity on thursday until the fire alarm went off and half the place cleared out. Friday night was packed as well with no fire alarm going off thank god. The dancers are great, and you may notice they eliminated the less expensive bottles off their menu. Cheapest vodka is $425 and champagne $375. They're set for a good run with the new renovation and the sound system is much better.

whatever
2008-10-25 14:54:00
cain had a great business. i applaud them for doing well for a couple of years. i think they might pull it off, but the location has such a stigma against it that it will be tough. all the revamps this fall have differed in their success, but as someone who goes out very often and is familiar with alot of the owners, i have to say that southside is actually the only spot really popping in the city. evrywhere else i have been i seen the same old promoters, and the same models. i havent seen any of the promoters at southside, and aftr asking james willis why he said there were no promoters, and it was staying that way. understood it is only 200 capacity though, which is not like filling 400 capacity at cain. either way both spots were fun, citrine, i wont go to because i know it sucks. but either way it will be interesting to watch as this fall unfolds.

Cain is always good. It's going to be even better, have yet to go to the new layout but i'm sure it's fun. Just because the rest of the places on 27th street suck, minus B8 doesent mean that you cant have a good time at Cain. Once you're inside it's a great crowd with amazing music, and not full of B&T guidos like the rest of the places.

2008-10-25 18:26:00

ITs funny how there seems to be this congregation of bitterness on this forum. There is no club/lounge that you guys wont shit on despite how good it may be. For 90% of club goers, CAIN is probably as good a club as they will ever frequent. Some of you still find a way to criticize it and say it is a bad place. Its like you all want to just talka bout stopping by Bungalo, or meeting up for drinks at 1oak last week, and finishing up the night at Tenjune or what ever the new \"hot spot\" is. Stop your bitching already and just appreciate each place for whatever it is. Most of the posts here are people patting themselves on the back for knowing the name of the owner of the new wine bar in meatpacking, or the door guy at place x. Get over it, its just a club, your not a nightlife celeb because you know the door man at every club in NYC. So shhhhh.... Nite nite...

Come on people! 27th street may not have the best reputation but, it certainly pulls in a crowd. Obviously, there are some haters here but, there is too much good and potential coming out of these renovations. The old Cain was more to relax and party at the same time but, the new Cain is a constant party. Regardless, it is a good place to hang out and it remains a great club! Hot people, hot drinks, and great service!

We haven't been hearing much about The Eldridge lately. An little birdy visiting for CMJ checks in: \"After getting denied from Element by some hostile bouncers - (no really I don't go to lame clubs, it's CMJ and there was an artist there I work with) we went over to The Eldridge out of boredom and I felt like stepped into a time zone. Cheesy ppl, men shmoozing and eventually smooching busted chicks with bottles and - dramatic pause - strawberries and the saxophonist really killed me... I work in music and I really can't fathom who would think its a good idea to blast saxophone over hip hop/house, the guys with the drums in the Hamptons are bad enough! And don't get me started on the floutist who I saw there one night...\" Oh, but it gets worse... much worse. \"Mr. Levine or whatever his name was cornered me against the bar for some bumpin and grindin'. After I kindly refused, I proceeded to ask him about the Kenny G saxophonist dude in the corner and why he thought that was a good idea. He promptly responded \"I pay him to be here!\" and stormed off to go rub up on some other victim, only thing was the bar was nearly empty and it was 2am Tuesday.\" Where's our diamond-encrusted-laser-cut-titanium-coke-cutting VVVIP card already? Update: A rep from The Eldridge checks in to deny that this encounter happened. However, they admit that he once hired a floutist.

Citrine: Already Ous't?

Well, we have to admit, we had our doubts about Citrine before last night's 'Grand Opening'. Unfortunately, our worst fears were confirmed. The pay-for-celebs-and-parties model for successful bottle service clubs expired some time ago (or has just been relegated to Miami and Vegas), but someone forgot to tell the management of Citrine. First things first, the place doesn't look anything like the renderings. As one of our commentors noted: \"The biggest mistake they made is that the picture floating around on the web (not the flyer discussed here, but something similar) sets such a high expectation, but looks nothing like the place itself,\" and \"The actual interiors of Citrine look like they just took the old Snitch (which itself looked like a car repair garage without the fun lift, but was actually appropriate for the garage bands that played there) and added some long drapes, painted plywood, and cheap rubbery/plastic covered stools and cushions for the banquettes. The sort of thing I might have done when I was 8 or 9 trying to 'dress up' my friends grease-pit garage in order to impress and seduce 10 and 11 year old girls.\" Ouch. What did we think? Walking into the party was like entering some kind of bizarro nightlife world. We were already feeling disoriented given our locale, then we saw Richie Rich next to some NYU undergrads, then some drag queens dancing on couches, then some businessmen on their Blackberries snapping photos. All packed into a fairly tiny space, which started clearing out around 12:30am. Not sure who the club is meant to attract given the area and the turnout last night... but with such masterminds behind the concept, we are expecting interesting things. Or not.

The place sucks - they have also been meeting with promoters for the past few weeks. To look for promoters even before you open, to grand open with a resident DJ from Sol (yes, Sol on 29th Street), to be on 21st street, to pay for celebrities, to pay for models, to pay promoters, it reminds me of Borgata, A.C - same exact B & T crowd, and same business model. To each its own, but they shouldn't market themselves as a hotspot, its a Long Island / Guido, VIP room of Porkys. And I don't mind cheap champagne, but don't run out of it (like they did last night), and please don't send out renderings that look nothing like the spot.

I disagree completely. The \"renderings\" we saw online, were exactly that...JUST renderings. The club in person last night looked great, and since it's not open to the public until next week, it's worth waiting to see how the public responds to it. As I recall, the first night tj opened, the dj was awful and the crowd was terrible...and look at it now.

hmmm... awfully suspicious comment there. dj paulo? citrine management? nobody has said that it looks good- let's face it... it looked like shit. not that different from snatch. tenjune isa kind of lame design, but mark and eugene are great operators. citrine is fucked!!!!!!!!!!

This entire website is a joke...shit talking nightlife while being a \"nightlife blog\" is entirely a waste of time. Either be journalists, and merely report on new and interesting places, or be an opinion column, and then you don't have your club trash losers to try and support your positions by running a blog. What does it accomplish to put up JE, or Citrine, or any number of shitty things, and then point at how shitty they are. Do the editors just hop from bad club to bad club and point at everything they can that's not great? Do you losers who keep posting do anything all day long? Its fine to call bullshit on something that is bullshit, but if everything is a joke or lame or hyped or fake, doesn't say much about you spending all your time on it. Get real jobs!

Learn the internet and how blogs work.They allow anyone to voice their opinion of the place.DBTH rocks. Keeps us all informed on the gossip that is going on in Manhattan nightlife. Understand the game before you throw rocks, then you wouldn't be as griefed as you are right now!DBTH > yUo !

umm, if i recall, TENJUNE opening night was hosted by Diddy and Dj Cassidy was the music.. guests were, Kanye, Jay Z, Beyonce, Penelope Cruz, Jermaine Dupree, Janet Jackson, and about 100 models.. at least thats what im seeing on the website video.. so if thats the comp to this place it should do great! Good luck kids

Reality Check
2008-10-24 17:17:00
I feel like I am in a alternate universe.I do not work at Citrine. I do work in the business. I do not know if the place will be good or not. However, last night was NOT the grand opening. Of course the crowd was unusual, it was a Richie Rich CD release party. how could it not be. I stopped by for a bit. The place does not look like the renderings. They hardly ever do. Still, the place looks nice. They have some more work to do but it still looks nice.I think that all the bloggers should wait until Tuesday which is really the first night the place is open for business. Let's see what happens.i just think there are a lot of people making unfair judgments based on a odd event that wasn't really open to the public.The one thing i have to say is that I think DBTH is very hypocritical. Someone there is friends with DJ Paolo. i spoke to the manager of Citrine last night when I was there i was told he was hired to close out the event. He made the flier which seems to have everyone all bent out of shape. DBTH posted the flier out of friendship, misinformed their readers by saying it was Citrine's Grand Opening and then proceeded to rip the space. Listen. All the bloggers ripping the space might be right. I am just saying what is fair is fair....Give the place a chance.
Awful Industry
2008-10-24 17:49:00
The issue with DBTH is that nobody from the real pulbic posts on it - all of these posts are from other club owners looking to bash another venue. Its funny how juvenile one industry can be.... every jealous promoter or owner that never made enough loot to open their own place sits here and bashes on every place that opens regardless of if its good or not.Tenjune opens - everyone says it sucksOne Oak - everyone said it wasnt making money in the beginning, going out of buisnessEldridge - everyone jumps on here ssying that kid that onws it is a doucheNow Citrine...its all the same bs over and over... this indsutry needs to learn some class - lucky for me I'm not involved in itI will say this - you have no clue how a place will do until its opened for at least a month or two - and it's identity is truly formedThese ppl are hilariious - place wasn't even open to the public - didnt even have promoters in there - it was a dumb private event for a gay dude - what do u expect? I expected this trash from the posters, but didn't expect such classless crap from the writes on this site

Citrine has gotten a lot of mention on this site, both good and bad. All the talk about it makes me want to go- despite how shitty their outside awning looks.

2008-10-24 18:07:00
I stopped in very briefly last night - i cannot believe how they were able to make this place so different from Snitch.I'm assuming the writer of this article didn't get in? Be honest... simply because it really looks so different from SnitchI dont care if this place or any of these places succeed - but the place looks very nice, pretty much same as the renderings minus the chandelier - definitely can't use the word \"cheap\"I'm going again tonight to see it on a regular night without RR's crowd
Yooo
2008-10-24 18:10:00
Pedo Bear - there are a lot of haters out there - especially in this biz... i would tend to not believe the bad on this awful site - most of the time its ppl that haven't even been to the placeI'm guilty of that myself in prior openings - thats what blogging is all about! ruining lives!

Friday Night
2008-10-25 03:14:00
Just got back from Citrine. Party was very good. A lot of beautiful people. a couple of Japs but nothing that you wouldn't see at any other \"Hot Spot.\" It was very hot in the place. They need more AC. that would really be the only complaint i could see someone making. I am going back Tuesday to see what that night is like but, this was a very good Friday night party

2008-10-25 10:05:00

Truth
2008-10-25 12:50:00
I am curious to know if DBTH had representation there last night. I have nothing to do with this place, believe it or not. I went to check out Thurs and Fri - i agree that Thursday was a little strange but then again it was not supposed to be open to the public, I knew someone with their publicist so i got snuck in. I went again last night and you have to give credit where credit is due - this was one of the best fri night parties i have seen in a very long time. I am just curious to know DBTH's opinion because if they disagree then I know their credibility is suspect - you cannot argue that the crowd and energy was top notch last nightPlease give us your thoughts
Music???

I didn't go Thursday, but I went last night. The door was tight, took me a while to get in - eventually I was savvy enough to see a friend getting a table and jumped on. Whoever wrote that the design was off is nuts?! What were you looking at...the banquettes are some of the best i have ever seen. Chicks were dancing all over them... Definitely my new Fri night destination, but they need to fix the air quick - but thats an easy fix

GUYS!!!!!!!!Hello???What have any of these guys ever done that is cool??? Please help me think, because I can’t remember!!!What have David, Adam, Shawn or Pavan ever accomplished that has been cool? Those guys couldn’t even get into B8 when it first opened even if their life depended on it.If you think I am full of shit, this is coming from a girl that worked this industry and has waitressed with all these promoters and knew it was the beginning of the end when these teams were signed on certain nights.What have they accomplished in this industry to reinvent themselves or this industry ? Who do we, or they, think they going to be? The next Ian Schrager or Andre Balaz? They have done nothing in my eyes to merit anything in this industry. Maybe they will make money, maybe they wont. I am not saying they are bad guys but this is why the nightlife, in general, in shit. I am not shitting on these guys, best of luck to them and main stream clubs like Cain \"LUXE\" and the rest of the b.s. that has saturated this city.Why does this blog even waste their time writing about nonsense shit?Lets just wish them all luck with their young \"model\" girls rocking H&M and fake Balenciaga bags and hope they make money.I just hope somebody reinvents the wheel QUICK because that would be something to blog about!!!
FOR REAL
2008-10-25 21:15:00
The problem with all of these comments is that everyone has a different perception of what is cool. Some people think that a bunch of models and rich guys hanging out in one place is cool.Some people think that a total Euro scene is coolOthers think a bunch of rich kids whole dress like derelicts not willing to spend a dime is cool.The waitress above seems to think having real Balenciaga bags is cool. (FYI Waitress my best friend was a waitress at Pink Elephant Southampton this summer, which shawn and Pavan ran. She made a lot of money. Probably helps buying those expensive bags)To each his ownThe bottom line is that this is a city of millions and millions of people. if you take all the places in this city the the toughest critic would call \"cool' you are talking about a couple hundred people on any given night. Most of those places make NO money and they do not last. Either way when most of you talk about \"cool\" places, you talk about places that accommodate tenths of 1% of the population.P.S. i was at Citrine last night and the majority of the people in Citrine last night could walk into any place in this city. So by the standards set by most of the people who posted on here, i guess it was pretty \"cool.\"Additionally :: Adam, Dave Shaun and Pavan are all really nice people which is pretty \"cool\" to me.
People Suck
2008-10-25 21:28:00
The funniest part of any post is the waitress who says, I am not shitting on these guys and then totally shits on them. that's so funny.I think DBTH needs to make arrangements to get video cameras in these places so we can all really see who is right or wrong. I am sure there is a lot of truth to what people say but, I have never once read anything on this blog about anyplace that the majority of the people posting liked or thought was going to be good. (Maybe El Bano) Everyone and Everyplace sucks.Just remember one thing`- Based on a post above - Once upon a time Noah Tepperberg and Jason Strauss were two guys just out of college promoting to Jappy kids. From everything i have seen and read, most people view them as the best in the business. Things change. It only takes one place. Before Amy opened Lot 61 she was just a girl working in a pretty good club. Lot was great but hardly B8. People grow. they change. they evolve. Time will tell. DBTH should do a where are they now in 3 months. Lets see who is right and who is wrong.

He also does Saturdays at SOL! LOLOLOLOL. What a way to open a lounge, but hey, it is 21st street, what do you expect.

JE is at it again. In another inane email wreaking of douchebaggery, the self-annointed king of clubland invites us to Status Fridays at Suzie Wong. Launched last week, Status Fridays sound like the party to be at. JE apologizes to all who didn't get in due to 'lines around the block'. However, fear not! All you need to do this week is ask for the JE guestlist. No need to even rsvp. Alls you have to do is 'say JE guestlist at the door for VIP admittance.' For table reservations you can email him directly because he can make 'special bottle deals'. But I thought... Anyway, best part is his email signature. It's so 1992, we're going to print a screenshot after the jump. AnD We OuT 2!

I went to the Citrine opening last night. It's already BnT, no need to wait for it to get bad.. The biggest mistake they made is that the picture floating around on the web (not the flyer discussed here, but something similar) sets such a high expectation, but looks nothing like the place itself.. FOR REAL is clearly trying to cover for this blunder that started a few weeks back.The actual interiors of Citrine looks like they just took the old Snitch (which itself looked like a car repair garage without the fun lift, but was actually appropriate for the garage bands that played there) and added some long drapes, painted plywood, and cheap rubbery/plastic covered stools and cushions for the banquettes. The sort of thing I might have done when I was 8 or 9 trying to \"dress up\" my friends grease-pit garage in order to impress and seduce 10 and 11 year old girls.

Citrine had DJ Paolo open their Grand Opening last night. I love how DBTH is bias and writesamazing things about Citrine. I went to the opening and it was the worst place ever, it was disgusting.Crowd was nasty and the renderings look nothing like the actual space.And for those that want more information on their Grand Opening DJ, DJ Paolo, go to his website, http://www.djpaolo.com/. He also does Saturdays at SOL! LOLOLOLOL. What a way to open a lounge, but hey, it is 21st street, what do you expect. CITRINE is the new HOME/GUESTHOUSE!(PS anyone can get into this place, just show up)
so gross
2008-10-24 10:51:00
we went to richie's party there last night. nasty! they ran out of (cheap) champagne early in the open bar. the space looks nothing like the pictures i've seen. and when someone from the real housewifes of nyc showed up, i knew it was time to leave! honestly that place is just what you'd expect from 21st street. thank god there were free samples of his&hers from ky.
Lets Make a Bet
2008-10-24 11:15:00
I am willing to bet that DBTH writes an amazing blog how great Citrine is, or they will compliment sometime within the next day, post another flyer, post some pictures, give a great review, etc. I am willing to bet a lot of money, so bias! The place sucks!!!!!!!!!

Saturday night was cold and windy, but we wanted to get our drink on in West Soho, anyway. Good thing we were wearing our fundies and we headed over the the Rated X Panty Party going on at Don Hill's. Now, Rated X has been going on for awhile, but we needed a status report. These days it'll cost you $7 (with rsvp). At the helm is the unstoppable Michael T. While his infamous Motherfucker party may be no longer (we're still pulling for a rebirth), Rated X is going strong. Any party with half-nekkid emo girls is our kind of party. If you want to check out Rated X, we suggest coming on the later side, after the shots in plastic cups have been downed and the clothes start coming off.

The birdy wire is on fire today. Word comes that Citrine will be set for a grand opening in the old Snitch space on Halloween. There will be a number of soft-opening parties before including Richie Rich's MAC benefit and P. Diddy's Rock the Vote (aka Obama Victory) Celebration. We're hearing that aside from the pricy servers and bartenders outfits, the bottle girls will be decked in real citrine gem pieces worht about $10k. That's some serious bling. We're hope they're on loan.

notice that the guy who claims to work for citrine did NOT mention Diddy...i am pretty sure that diddy thing is not a diddy thing and he will not be doing anything at citrine. the place is tiny with an awkward layout. nothing like a street notorious for nightclub related crimes to open a new \"hotspot.\" with 1oak, greenhouse, bijoux, mrwest, and beatrice the cool kids are not going to citrine after the first 2 weeks. another disappointment.

2008-10-23 02:37:00
First off the person who said the place has an akward layout is misinformed. the space looks great. i was in there today. Whomever said anything about construction was wrong because the space is pretty much complete.Tomorrow night has a private event for Richie Rich. Friday Perez Hilton has a event from 8-10 followed by a press opening followed by a party that from what I hear will be the best friday in the city. Saturday is private again. According to my sources (and they are usually right) Tuesday Sam Ronson spins a opening party of sorts. I do not believe they are doing the typical \"grand opening.\" This spot will be very good. Half of the spaces \"diddy\" listed aren't even places where cool kids go.

Image Courtesy of NY Times Cultural wunderkind Allen Salkin had a piece in the Times on Sunday pondering whether the 'rise' of uptown (read Harlem) nightlife was an encroachment into NYC's storied downtown nightlife scene. Let us just spare you the tedium of reading the article and answer that ourselves: No. Moving on... we were able to cull an interesting little tidbit of info from the piece: \"The owners of West Chelsea stalwart Cain closed the club for a $1 million renovation to the decor and sound system, and plan to reopen as Cain Luxe, on Oct. 23, a spokeswoman said.\" We always thought the sound was ok at Cain. More interesting, besides that and the previously reported loss of the sunken dance floor, is the name. Cain Luxe? Hmmm. It will be very interesting to see if Team Cain can pull this off. We've seen nighclub relocations recently (Pink Elephant), but a same space overhaul? And, on 27th no less? This will be an intertesting one to watch, indeed.

Word on the street is that things are not so plum at the Plumm. A little birdy writes in that honcho Noel Ashman is involved in a tough lawsuit with his former head of security. And promoters are 'leaving left and right'. And a doorman and bottle host 'just put in their two weeks'. And waitresses and bartenders haven't been 'recieveing their credit card tips'. Hmmm... sounds like the writing is on the wall. Anyone know what's going on on the wrong side of 9th Avenue? Update: A spokesperson for The Plumm denies these accusations and insists that no waitstaff is owed any money, nor that there is a lawsuit pending.

THE HONEST TRUTH

HEY Truth (Noel), My girlfriend is a fucking bartender at the Plumm and she hasn't recieved her credit card tip check in over a month. I know you're in a shit load of self induced debt, but that doesn't mean you should be using money that doesn't belong to you, ie- the servers CREDIT CARD TIPS. Just this last Saturday she came home with only $60 because your upstairs party was shit, she also told me that she watched a bartender walk out mid shift because she hasn't been paid since she started working there. Every night she comes home from work I have to hear her bitch about how horrible the place is. Apparently at the end of each night, all of your promoters line up and beg and beg and beg to be paid. The girls behind the bar are all looking for new gigs. Oh and Miguel, your Doorman and Bottle Host, is looking to nest somewhere else. Maybe you can bribe him to stay by paying him all the money you owe him.\"Someone who could not get let in?\" What a fucking joke. Do you even show up to Plumm anymore Noel? Your place is crawling with underaged queens guidos, White and Black trash, and people who thought they were in Country Club. I hardly call that a tough door.Oh and New Yorker (Noel) Your name is SHIT on the street. The only Promoters that will work with you are young 20yr old hipsters who are just getting to know the business, and washed up, old, cokeheads.Enjoy your plummeting business and reputation.

This place is hilarious. I get dragged there now and then, under the terms that there will be an open bar from 10-11pm. The last 3 times I've been there at 10 sharp, the bartenders denied that the open bar exists, even though the plumm's website promotes it. 3 times i went for the open bar, and three times I was denied. They are just trying to lure people there any way they can.

THE HONEST TRUTH is absolutely right... My friend used to promote at his old place 'Veruka'...after 4 successful nights of hosting parties he quit because he never got paid... He also invents fake parties to try to get more people in his club - by that I mean the fliers he sends out, like the ones on joonbug, are BS...Before truth(noel) writes that this is not true, let me see how I know this.... well.... My gf is a model and had no idea who Noel was or what Plumm is... HOWEVER, her name and picture was on two of these fliers - for her birthday and for her signing party....total BS!!!!.... and honestly very, very sad.And Noel, you care so much about getting a celebrity's name at your club for page 6 and what not...FYI - the people who go to a club because a celebrity went there are people you don't want at your club!!! I've got too much other stuff to write, but i'll just keep it at this because the other stuff i'd write would really be a low blow.

You get to the point where he owes you 1 or 2 grand and in mid shift you say pay me or I'm leaving right now, literally stopping the music. This is a FACT and I'm sure a number of the guys that have worked there, even when it was \"good,\" will back up this statement.I hope Noel finally fuck's the wrong person and they sue the shit out of him.

Noel is a good guy, but a bad businessman. He does owe a lot of people a lot of money. I always refused to work at Plumm because it puts you in the position of having to run after him for money. Very similar to another club COUGH Room Service COUGH run by a well known and generally liked guy COUGH Rita COUGH who just doens't feel the obligation to pay people. What can you do...

Hey bs, The little birdie isn't the owner of whatever club. You think club owners are intimidated by the fucking PLUMM? Puh-lease. You give yourself too much credit Noel. The little birdie was probably one of your staff members who is entirely too frustrated in having to deal with your bullshit and bouncing checks that only come once every 2 months. The sad part is that the money you keep from them isn't even money from your pocket, It's their CREDIT CARD TIPS. If you would pay your staff accordingly and in a timely fashion, and without the staff member having to beg for it, this article would have never surfaced. Take the opportunity to learn from this and seize making this horrible mistake. The staff is the backbone of your or any club, when they are happy with you and their work environment, they will work hard for you. Remember that people who work for you that you don't pay are called slaves. Do you want people to think that you are ok with this? Instead of covering it up, or denying it with multiple USER NAMES bs, truth, newyorker, talkofthetown, on this shitty website, Fucking do something about it. Fucking rectify it. Admit your faults, fix it and move on. You being a big baby about it isn't helping your already sour reputation.

I worked for Noel a long time. He is most definitely withholding money from employees....he sets up meetings for everyone at the same time to make himself look real busy and makes everyone wait for hours to get there checks. When you finally get in the office he starts renegotiating with you...slimy little man...i cant believe people still work for him. It figures people like Samantha Ronson still let him put her name on flyers....shes another slime bag! They will all get it in the end.......does anyone really care that Mr Big is an investor in that shit hole club? I cant believe Tim Spuches went back to Noel. What a let down.....

I worked at the Plumm for a whole miserable year and the only reason I stayed was because all the paychecks were 3 weeks behind and I was afraid I wouldn't get my last 3 weeks of checks. Turned out to be true, it took me 4 months after quitting to finally get the last $900 owed me and that was after calling literally every day. I endured verbal abuse from that little shit, having to make a big deal over z-list celebrities and has-beens (Noel thinks that everyone who has been on one episode of Law and Order is a \"celebrity\"), and texting him every 5 minutes to tell him how empty his crappy club was when I worked the door. He calls page 6, or other gossip columns and makes up stories about the unfortunate celebrities who do come to the Plumm just to see his name in print. I took one night off to see my brother before he left to serve in Afghanistan for 15 months and he flipped out at me because I told my managers and didn't tell him personally I was taking off. This was all because Ice T was having a party for his wife that night and Noel wanted me to work the door.I had quite a number of bounced checks, and the amounts were always off. All the promoters and DJs were always owed money and would have to wait around until 6 in the morning just to get a check which was pretty much worthless since they would bounce anyway. Noel Ashman is an ugly fat joke. He has a terrible reputation and people he calls friends talk shit about him behind his back. He'll make employees and promoters come in for meetings at a specific time and then show up an hour or more later. He also will tell you to dress a certain way while he comes in to his own club wearing one of the two t-shirts he owns and pants with a hole in the crotch. Plus he scratches his balls ALL THE TIME. So all the bad stuff written here about him is completely true and anyone who says otherwise is full of shit, believe me. Everyone who has ever worked for him I'm sure has a story about how he fucked them over. Don't EVER work for him, and don't go to his shit club.

I'm embarassed to say, but I used to be a waitress at Plumm (and NO I don't have to give my name for obvious reasons. I think they will know who I am anyway after they read the specifics of this entry). NEVER HAVE I EVER in all of my years working in the nightclub industry have I dealt with such UNPROFESSIONAL and INCOMPETENT people that I have dealt w/while working at the Plumm. For one, and I think this has been well established in the above comments, but I feel its very necessary to reiterate: the Ashman family, Noel and his mother Robyn in particular, are theifs. They steal money from their employees that is not even theirs to begin with! (ie.: credit card tips) I waited 6 weeks after starting the job, before I got a paycheck! The number of bounced checks they gave me was uncountable. Finally, they closed their account so the checks were worthless and thats why they would have their employees come in there at ridiculous hours like 4 am to supposedly pick up their money. After they bullshit you for hours, you finally realize that they arent going to pay you and you leave just to do it all over again another late night/early morning. Yes, they owed me money. And yes I eventually got the money but the frustration and aggravation that I had to go through just to get it was beyond UNNECESSARY! I left there crying some nights after being told to come get my money just to be escorted out by security as if they had never told me to stop by in the first place. I shouldn't even be wasting my time writing this but I think it is important for the public to know what happens to their money when they come here. Also, I have a lot of friends that I used to work with there that are just beginning their own battles to collect the money that they are owed. The bottom line is that Noel and his mom are struggling to pay the bills at Plumm so much that they are taking the credit cards tips from their employees and keeping it from them until they have no other choice but to pay them. They should just shut down. And they eventually will.

i worked at the door of the plumm for over a year. I did get late checks periodically but eventually got them.I generally find most of these comments to be unfounded and vicious. Tom tompson, cina and noel ashman always took my problems seriously and did address them i never found them to be shady in any way.To people like me who have been in this business for a while this was refreshing.

I hope everyone realizes that all the positive posts on this board are coming from Noel and/or his mom. He knows about this website and is probably shitting himself every night because the truth is finally coming to light for people to see. He is a sleazy little cum bucket who is a waste of a life and should probably go crawl under a bridge like the troll he is.

2008-10-26 18:19:00
yeap, I agreed, sometimes we do get our checks late but we always do get our checks. And Tom, Tim and Noel always talk to us about everything that is going on. And now that Caesar is working there i am very happy about it, bcause he looks out to us and make sure problems and other things gets taken care of.Ohh one more thing Robin did nothing wrong to any of us. so lets be nice about it and keep it to our selfs.

2008-10-26 18:26:00
\"who cares\" is right, this is getting out of control. i used to work as a promoter for Noel and yes he is a tough guy to deal with but i always got my money. And i work with some of the best clubs in the city and i will be the first one to say that, everyone is going thru a tough time with this bad economy. I dont deal with Noel anymore but I still give caesar some parties and he gets my money every time with no delay. So if anyone of you are having a bad time in getting your money talk to him or Tim. They been there in a very short time and they have done a really good job getting people paid. So IF ANYONE OUT THERE HAS A PROBLEM, TALK TO CAESAR OR TIM. AND THEY WILL FIX THIS THINGS.

I want to just say that I witnessed a lot of really just bad business behavior by Noel Ashman. I did get paid all but my last two weeks (which I expected) and I laughed when I read the comment above about how he holds meetings....scheduling everyone at some random time like 4pm on a tuesday...then he shows not an hour late, but three hours late, at 7pm, with his cronies trying to apologize for him. I think he has some mental problems or is on some weird medication too...I saw him hit one of the waitesses one night, and that's when I left, and I never went back. the last two weeks of pay were not worth having to look at that cretin noel ever again!!

On Thursday, DBTH headed over to the IAC to help save strays. The ASPCA had their benefit there and the place got pretty hot. DJ Berrie was at the top of his game, mixing our favorite disco music with our favorite current stuff. They even had some pretty cute adoptable dogs roaming about, along with socialites Lake Bell, Kristen Johnson, Katie Lee Joel, and some real housewives (our faves) . I nearly adopted one (a dog) but came one or two drinks short. Our only complaint was the pervasive lack of disco attire, despite the invite claiming such. We had nearly thrown on our orange polyester but switched at the last minute, on the hunch that non-socialites have more fun. We headed to the hog pit straight aways upon leaving for some authentic throwdown.

Our friends over at Gothamist have a copy of Milk & Honey maestor Sasha Petraske's email announcing the specifics for the previously reported transformation of Milk & Honey from a cocktail bar to a private club. Not just any kind of private club, but a Social Club Charter from New York State. Bam! No more text reservations (after the transformation period). From now on there will be a series of membership levels, or keys, that provide various levels of access. We like the key for those in the industry. Does that include DBTH?

Could the private club formula become a trend in New York clubs? With community boards coming down hard on many liquor license renewals due to noise and traffic compaints and bottle service fading in the wake of the financial crisis, would membership fees help clubs stay afloat?
teabiscuit
2008-10-19 16:05:00
Gamal -- that's the question. I'm what problem this is really intended to solve -- licensing or revenue? I think the private members club is a good idea, if only because if you can plan ahead a bit you can get a grown up drink and have a conversation. Say what you like about Soho House but it is probably the only bar that's hospitable in the MPD on a saturday night.

I doubt this will become a trend. New York is too much of an International City for a bunch of places to go private.

If you think getting a liquor license is tough, imagine how difficult it is to get a license for a members only club.
teabiscuit
2008-10-21 12:31:00
I'd think it would be easier to get a license for a members-only club than a bar, because the members-only club is better able to enforce limits on noise and so forth. But I wonder what Bob Bookman would say.

It's been a busy week on the circuit. Last night at Skylight Studios in Soho the Raconteurs fronted by Jack White of the White Stripes rocked an intimate crowd for the launch of the T-Mobile G1- the first smart phone to utilize the new Google Android platform. This was easily one of the best parties of the year. Having recently completed a relentless world tour, the Raconteurs played a deafening full set. This little birdy just missed them at Austin City Limits last month, but last night more than made up for it. Not to mention the food and drink- there was a Japanese candy bar, hot dogs, pretzels, assorted global tapas and yet again, Cassidy (the hardest working DJ in show business) holding down the DJ duties. More pics after the jump.

it wasnt that good. one half of the party made no sense with the other half. The band wasnt that good at all and played way too long.. killed the vibe unless u happened to be a big fan of the band. Ive seen SG do events that made a lot more sense all around.im very suprised with all of DBTH's criticisms that he said this was \"easily one of the best parties of the year\" thats a bold statement and I guess hes just a big Raconteuors fan

DBTH always writes positive things about strategic group, lavo, tao, marquee, etc - don't you see a pattern here? The party sucked, and I had no idea who the band was. It was ghetto (just like the Hennessey party). It was all guys except for the 2 promoter tables with wanna-be models (and they were paid to be there). The party was horrible.

Forget about making sense... the Raconteurs were great. All depends on whether or not you like the Raconteurs. If you think they played too long, you obviously don't like them that much, but rare to see an act of their caliber play a corporate event. As for SG, if you consistently throw great events, you have respect from DBTH. Period.

Hennessy threw down at Gotham Hall last night in celebration of the Hennessy Artistry tour featuring Ne-Yo. The series finale had Ne-Yo performing on stage with Fabolous and Leona Lewis. Cassidy and Jazzy Jeff provided backup DJ support. We have to tip our hats to Noah and Jason- the NYC/LV duo are at the top of their game. While we missed the red carpet and didn't get to ask Ne-Yo or Fab our prepared questions (If they want it, do cowards still get it?), we spotted Usher, Ludacris and Russell Simmons among the who's-who of the Hip Hop and R&B worlds. Oh, and Ray Allen and Rajon Rondo (Pride!). Word was that Simmons held court at a Presidential Debate party afterwards- more on that later. We got our opening invitation for Lavo last month, but we're still waiting for the empty seat on the jet the next time you guys go out there (NYE plans aren't quite nailed down yet...).

Just days after Pink Elephant unveiled their Sao Paolo intentions, a Little Birdy was peeping on 10AK's slick new website and discovered something crazy! Not wanting to be outdone by their rival to the north, it seems Scott and Richie are destined to head south to battle it out in Sao Paolo for the love and money of Brazil's jet set. Also on tap is the long rumored 1OAK Miami. Is 1OAK really making its first expansion in South America, or is this just a bit of one-upsmanship to tweak the Pink Team? And if these plans are real, then are they for real? Do these NY operators with a limited global presence, excluding the one off parties at film festivals etc., think that the Brazilian youth are going to be swayed by a short lived NYC brand? Or is this just a licensing deal, enabling their investors to get a bit more cash back? If the latter is true, the owners must hope that these locations don't diminish their brand name, which isn't that strong to begin with.

Anyway, Public and DC chef Brad Farmerie prepared a dinner pairing the courses with a flight of Highland Park- from the 12-year to the 40-year. The highlight was a roast half-duck which was paired with the 25-year. Another highlight was being seated next to Adam Levy, editor of The Whisky Life magazine. Gotta get me some of that life.

Stua & DBTH. To my understanding Bungalow8 is merely the host of this \"fashion event\" for Refreshment Vintage, presumably some sort of Vintage T-Shirt company.

NYC nightlife cant be beat, not London, not Dubai, not LA, it's still the best. The shame is that 27th street is such a shit hole. Bungalow might not be what it once was, but who said it was good then? It was just a bunch of celebs, and star fuckers circle jerking about how exclusive the place was, when in fact no one actually had the kahunas to bother trying to get in. Same thing with The Eldridge today... B8 is still one of the hardest doors in NYC, and whether or not you're invited to this party certainly does not mean that you will be let in. Please take note that it is happening on a Wednesday night, which is almost as cool as Sunday night.

The Eldridge and Bungalow both have the same philosphy that it isn't the bottle factor, its the cool factor, but if Bungalow really did post this, then they have really lost their vision.If Bungalow 8 really wanted to make money, then they can easily hire promoters to pack the place, but they don't do that, same thing with The Eldridge - that is why NYC nightlife sucks, because promoters think they run the city.

There are still a few great spots in NYC where you can go with your friends and have a great time without dealing with any BS, and Bungalow is one of those places. People who spend time there know exactly what I'm talking about. Bungalow has always hosted private events, so as far as I know, this is nothing new for them. Receiving an invitation to an event on Facebook (or anywhere else for that matter) certainly doesn't imply guaranteed admission.

Excuse me?!?! I randomly walked into B8 two Saturday nights ago. Not cool. Bad crowd, mixed vibes. Disco used to only let me in with a few girlfriends, back in the day, when everyone was there and bungalow had the tighest door in the city. This special night he didnt mind me rolling in with +5. Bungalows gone down the shitter...the facebook posting says it all.Now about the Eldridge. It seems only a few of you have actually been there and others are falling for the hype. The place is horrible. Im a personal friend of Matts..he texts me/begs me to come all the time. One Thursday night, long, long ago, it was descent. What made it not horrible were the free $30 dollar cocktails Matt supplied me and my friends with. A few Satursdays ago, it was DEAD. I mean DEAD, and at 130am no less. I cruised over to 1oak after bolting 5 mintues later, and it 1oak was packed. I had an awesome night there. It was still happening past 4am. The only spots worthwhile in the city are Rose Bar, Beatrice, and 1oak. I havent checked out chloe yet though. Apotheke had a semi-decent crowd, and the eldridge fails to live up to of the hype

yes! \"stripper sundays\" at pangaea was the best. if you were special you got to stay there until 5:30 a.m. after they kicked everyone out for the private after hours. also, when rocco started sundays it wasn't \"stripper sundays.\" it was more international, jetsetters, models, and celebs. it became stripper sundays when the morrissey brothers joined the crew. i personally loved every minute of both phases of those sundays and i think i only missed 4 or 5 sundays out of the whole 2.5 years (due to being on the payroll).and this post has nothing to do with the OP but i couldn't resist after stua brought that up.

bungalow 8 is the place in nyc that really doesn't give a shit.. they just want people who are relaxed and not trying hard to come and do just that, relax and not give a damn. If you go to b8 you know, its about you and your friends just chilling out.....not like 1oak where a bunch of cheap fucks that used to work at abercrombie and fitch who just started to listen to house music clammer to get on the good side of a doorman named BIN who's small hands, narrow shoulders, lane bryant trenchcoat and pre-pubescent mustache would have you wondering why anyone would care if this dehydrated, exhausted likeness to \"the hills\" justin bobby lets you cross his velvet rope. so if your tired of the overhyped B.S. of newer spots, throw it back for a classic night at an old favorite.

I can't stand places that are overly crowded. I love 1oak and no 1oak is not always crowded, especially before 2am. I love B8 and have absolutely nothing negative to say about it. Beatrice is cool and NOT always packed! Chloe's another great one, as is Bijoux. Stop knocking Matt and The Eldridge, movie night is pretty cool and so are Thursdays. Southside is another great place. -Just my opinion, no need to pick my post apart.As for BIN, 1oak needs to upgrade ASAP. That's my one and only negative comment about the place. The waitresses are pretty hot, can't forget them.

Classic is the rage these days. Absinthe dens, traditional cocktails, blah blah. But we got a chuckle at this morning's sponsored ad from Urban Daddy, asking to conisder Drambuie for our next drink order. According to the Daddy, Drambuie is \"crafted with aged malt whiskies and spiced honey, and formed from a secret recipe that dates back to 1745. You're probably familiar with its key role in a Rusty Nail (two parts DRAMBUIE liqueur, one part Scotch), but you might be surprised to learn it also goes down easy with cranberry juice or soda.\" Yummo. So barkeeps, consider yourself warned. There will be a serious run on the Buie starting today. Make sure you are fully loaded.

What can you say about Upstairs, other than it was fun while it lasted. Originally outed in a Page Six item, the Soho club became notorious on the tubes of DBTH, with its curtains, Diddy fights, rules for entry, and Wayne's general disdain for us. But the fun time is over for now. After seeing our report of a lack of activity the past few weeks, a Little Birdy told us I'm pretty sure it may be done for good. When they applied for the liquor license, they applied for a restaurant license which means they have to stop serving after 10pm - this was obviously not happening.But all hope is not lost. According to our commenters, the Upstairs team is \"moving it down the block to fr.og and changing the name\". This means that Origine, which was Zev Norotsky project, obviously didn't pan out so good. Sigh. Apparently the Upstairs team has been working round the clock on getting the space ready, and will unveil their creation sometime in the next few weeks.

DBTH will be hard at work and will have more posts than ever in the coming months, maybe even the coming year(s). Yes, they will be busy reporting to us upscale places that were once cool at $18 per drink, that can no longer stay open because people have finally realized how annoying it is to buy $18 drinks in this rough economy (myself included). What a shame that it takes an economic depression to realize that 18 is too much for a damn drink. Once every bar/club that was once cool closes DBTH will be reporting us breaking news that Wayne only allows tall blonds through the breadline.

We haven't heard much from the corner of Spring and Broadway in the past few month. No celeb sighting, no fights, no flyer follies. Nothing. Then a Little Birdy reported, \"I've been to Upstairs above Cafe Bari three times in the last two weeks and it's always locked and closed\". Our friends at the Bloc Group issued a no comment, but word on the street that the entire concept is getting a redo, and the team will be unveiling it sometime in the next few weeks. In the meantime, you will have to find a way to cope. We will all get through this together.

It's a holiday weekend. The world's economy is crashing and your portfolio has been destroyed. The Mets and Yankees aren't in the playoffs (heh). So why not take your last $199 and go to Montauk? There's no minimum, and none of the ass hats from the summer will be there to annoy you. Because by Tuesday, your bank will be out of business and you won't have that $199 anyway, so you may as well have fun spending it.

The economies of Las Vegas and London are in the crapper. Who knows what is happening with Dubai? But Brazil, while caught up in the global crisis, has experienced a manufacturing boom these past few years and is hotter than ever. Now, our own Pink Elephant has decided to plant a South American Stake in Sao Paulo, bringing a little NYC sizzle to one the largest cities in the world. Will the brand play there? We aren't certain, since the culture of Brazil is well defined and not dependent on US trends. But Sao Paulo has come into its own as a global destination, and we admire the Pink crew for heading there to ride the wave.In other Pink Elephant news, a Little Birdy tells us that they are also California dreaming, saying \"heard from a source within the company that construction is already underway at the old Nationale space\" in the heart of Hollywood. We always loved the multi level Hollywood club, but it was never really a dance space, so we are hard pressed to imagine Pink fitting there.

The \"Pink Elephant\" Brand is as outdated and beaten up as the \"Lotus\" Brand was when it opened a club in Sao Paulo 5 years ago. Lotus in Sao Paulo tanked from opening night and was regarded as a joke by the brand loving Paulistas. Given that Pink Elephant is significantly passed its sell-by date as was the case with Lotus, I'm sure it will suffer the same quick demise. Mynt, Sao Paulo which recently closed was successful for a short while but Brazilans need to distance themselves from the mainstream 'branded' NYC nightlife scene and come up with something fresh and authentically Brazilian for Sao Paulo.

While the rumors of Cain's demise proved to be false, the planned renovations are well underway. It seems that when the Jamie, Jayma and the team couldn't lock down a new space further downtown to relocate, they embarked upon a plan to differentiate themselves from the rest of the Chelsea wanna-be's. Time for the details, with a Little Birdy writing:Cain has a new creative director with a lot in store for when Cain re-opens on October 29th. As far as the renovation of the venue, the rock that was the DJ booth has been broken into pieces and removed. The room is now one level and the tables are now slightly larger and a tad more spread out giving more room for girls to dance on tables. Cain will remain open Wednesday through Saturday, with a different theme for each night. While nothing is official yet, the grand re-opening will be nothing less than extravagant with a big name performance and a unique theme. Expect to be in wowed and surprised... While Cain was looking to move downtown they have changed their tune a bit and plan to see where their current venue goes, while also branching into other outlets abroad and pushing their brand.What we like about this plan is manner in which Cain surveyed the current landscape and took advantage of an opportunity. As they tired of being lumped in with the Jon B's and JE's of the world, a plot was hacthed to make their escape to greener pastures. But when nothing materialized, Cain took advantage of the space they controlled and decided to invest within. That's change you need and change you can believe in.

They couldn't sell the joint for the obscene asking price and their deal for the earth space never transpired.

New details about Jon B.'s soon to open Greenhouse just keep pouring in. This time - it's visual.

Spread across 2 levels, the Soho club will accommodate 600 guests, features 3 bars on the ground level and 2 additional ones in the lower level (pictured above). Each floor will have a DJ booth, and there is a 200 SF performance space on the main level, just in case on of Jon's high profile friends feels like making it happen. Additional images after the jump. 3D specs are recommended but not required.

GoaG says:We have already gotten more than one email from very “in the know” New Yorkers that insist that the LES (Lower East Side), including the Bowery and her hip hotel and bars are OVER. As in DUNZO. At least for the “cool kids” of the city that refuse to follow trends.She continues:My heart broke a little upon hearing this news. Apotheke in Chinatown was the #1 spot of our well-researched “where the cool kids are” post, and I have yet to go see the Aussie Bartender Albert in action…We assume she is referring to Albert Trummer, who is originally from Vienna. This of course, makes him Austrian. Oops. Back to the topic at hand, we have to wonder why she is worried that the \"LES is Dunzo\". In terms of being interesting or happening, the LES has been \"dunzo\" since approximately 2005. In 2006, it was ingeniously branded as \"Hell Square\", signaling the official end of its run as the counter balance to the overt lameness of the Meatpacking District. Since that time, the LES crowd headed en mass to Brooklyn, and the neighborhood is now flooded with uptowners, college kids and B&T Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights. The operators have moved southwest towards the Chinatown/Little Italy area, and now the LES and MePa, once polar opposites, are really fraternal twins. Slightly different on the outside, but made up of the same genes. You could point to the Box, Thompson Lower East Side, 205 etc as symbols of the neighborhood's continued relevance. But these are late comers were around during the reemergence of the LES as a neighborhood. By the time these new clubs were established, the residents (both old and new) were so fed up with nightlife they made it their mission to close them down. This is a far cry from the beginning of the decade, when the LES was for dive bars, live music, and general fun. No longer. We feel the Eldridge was the final nail in the coffin.So yes - the LES is Dunzo, and has been for quite a long time. It certainly doesn't take an \"in the know\" New Yorker to tell you that. Or maybe it does, and that makes us weep.

***CONTENT
We've been seeing a ridiculous amount of chatter across the Birdy Wire about the pending opening of Greenhouse, Jon B's long in development nightclub that is LEED certified. Popcorn! Greenhouse will take over the former Club Shelter space at 150 Varick Street , and according to the press release: Greenhouse is located at 150 Varick Street , in SoHo , and is designed to be a unique \"green\" experience. One of Greenhouse's most spectacular attributes is the transparent ceiling fixture, compromised of over 5,000 individually hung crystals, which is designed to emulate a rolling landscape. The bars will be clear recycled glass panorama designs, which will display lush natural scenes. With two floors and two separate sound systems, Greenhouse offers multiple VIP sections both upstairs and down, and a raised performance stage and backstage section. We like that there are multiple VIP sections, because there are some VIP's we just are more I than, and we don't want to be in their section. According to a Little Birdy, the \"The space looks pretty raw at the moment\" and \"Barry from Stereo is involved in some capacity (think he raised capital to buy points from Jon and then resold them to his investors). Jon B. has been fishing this deal for a long time.\" What a dynamic duo! They are gunning for a late October opening, but early November is our call.

Speaking of Halloween, a Little Birdy writes \"The Garden of ONO closes forever on halloween this year. It then gets hit with a wreckingball and turned into a new nightclub (name pending)\". We checked in with an inside Birdy who is rumored to be involved and responded \"when there are details to speak of, I promise I will tell you. But as of yet there are none. I promise. People are talking and they have Zero clue of the real Truth.\" It will be interesting to see what is in store for this prime space in what we can call Meatpacking 3.0. There are a few of the old nightlife establishments hanging on, and we aren't sure if a repurposed nightclub will really fly. Is the City really interested in another 1OAK, or is the space best used as a four star restaurant that attracts tourists early and wanna-be scenesters late? We will know soon. As to the Halloween party, well, if it really is the last night, it seems like a costume affair is heck of way to wrap thing's up.

Is Dubai Recession Proof
***AUTHOR
DBTH
***DATE
2008-10-07 08:05:00
***CONTENT
They were two interesting reports from the past few days covering Dubai, the glittering jewel of the Middle East. The NY Times reasons \"Some of Dubai’s more extravagant building projects — the ever-bigger malls, islands and indoor ski slopes — are likely to be dropped if they do not already have financing lined up, bankers say. The credit crisis could also reduce demand from buyers, who will have a harder time getting mortgages.\" But then low and behold, the very next day Dubai based companies announced plans to build a new city and the Nakheel Tower, which will be the world's tallest building. Do these plans reinforce the notion that Dubai is recession proof? Or will the credit crisis crush the Emirate's dream of a creating a lasting center of finance and luxury in the Gulf?It's obvious that the Emirates plan on continuing the development, and that they have the cash to pay for it and the oil reserves to back it up. But who are they building it for? The global banks are in chaos and are pulling staff and closing offices, concentrating their resources in certain regions. Their employees are foreign speculators won't be buying those sparkling condos popping up everywhere. Global travel will slow, meaning that those rooms at the ever-growing number of luxury hotels will stay empty, the restaurants won't be crowded, and those massive nightclubs the London and New York operators have signed on to operate won't be crowded. These things were built for foreigners with fat expense accounts, not locals. This is not to say that the ruling family, Dubai's citizens, and the rest of the U.A.E. aren't still flush with money. They are. But you can build mini-cities and keep building a bigger tower than the one you built last year, but what will it matter if no one shows up to use it? It's a situation that Dubai, Abu Dhabi and the rest of the region is looking at for the next 12-18 months as the global recession occurs. But their investment in infrastructure, Emirates Air and sustainable development helps position themselves to be the financial center they planned on being when (or if) the economy ever straightens out.

The problem with Dubai is that it over built for a population that they haphazardly speculated would be higher. It never grew as fast as they predicted it would but they just kept building. I believe they have been borrowing more than their GDP in vast numbers and private developers like Nakheel are starting to come undone. This place, like almost every other place in the world will be greatly affected by a global recession. Hong Kong, London, New York City, Toky and places that serve the world on a global scale will be hit hard, far worse than a Dubai or Abu Dhabi but will feel it a lot less severely.Dubai has a lot to learn and I think when this is all over that it will. There are ex-pats leaving in droves, leaving their cars abandoned at airports. The companies will follow for a safer bet somewhere else (not all) and you will (if we remain in a global-financial-recession) see tourism generate far less income. The whole point of Dubai is to be a center of the middle east as it would serve almost 400 million people in its sphere of influence as a hub for finance and trade, tourism, commerce. That means jobs, and more jobs and then throngs of people nearly 1/3 or 2/3 , really, of ex patriots and construction workers. Well they're heading out so there go those numbers and if that is the case then money is heading out of Dubai. I would say it is in trouble like the rest of us but that it will recover like the rest of us.

Just a few weeks after closing down the pop-collared crowd's beloved Bellas, the Martignetti brothers held a private party last night to preview the Majestic Southside, their redesigned lounge next to their eponymous restaurant. From what we hear, the Boston boys are hoping that the new name and redesign will attract a new, less preppy type of clientele. But with the ever-growing economic crisis, it seems purdent to take every dollar you can get, no matter who it's coming from.

On behalf of the owners of Starlounge, Jeff Krauss, and myself,I appreciate that Down By The Hipster made an effort to highlight the contradictions that arise from our flyer design with the name of the party that it is advertising, but I wish to indicate that this is exactly the point that we were trying to get across. We carefully crafted and chose to present and couple the design of the flyer with the name of the party to show the disappointment in the state of nightlife today. We are glad to see our depiction making an impact and hope to continue the use of out of the ordinary and contradictory flyers in an effort to not only carry a deeper message but to stand out from all the cookie cutter invites.Thank you again for bringing this criticism to the public's attention.We hope to make an influence and induce change!We'd also like to inform readers that groups of 4+ girls get a free bottle of champagne before 12!

buy a few vowels and learn how to post grammatically correct. le royale has had an occassional fun party, but it's hardly a 'must' on any night of the week. the city market is changing. unfortunately, the 27th street collapse and the evolution of the lounge are pushing 'that crowd' (careful how you label) into all of our desirable spaces. it has watered nightlife down to the point that over-promotion has become repellent.

Reply to :grammatically correct ''buy a few vowels and learn how to post grammatically correct'' i apolgise for my Grammar it is not my strong point ...you got me on that ,..lol.but i do truly believe We have had many interesting nights/events @ Le royale and i see more great places opening up with great ideas that i think have been good for nyc, but hey maybe we are looking at things very differently - maybe are measures of success or what is interesting for nightlife can be viewed differently ...i think 27th st and even the meat-packing have peaked a long time ago and it fair to say that there not going to get any better soon from a creative level -but not because of the areas but because of what they see as good nightlife for new yorkers and ill admit there were def times where they were fun and exciting places , i do feel that i have some points about where nightlife will be heading and i hope i'm right that its about content and not just commercial success with bottle service alone .Nightlife is very interesting and there are many angles - but i hope you get my point .I sincere have a lot of respect for ny nightlife .

Hi guys... My company created the flyer, but it was not called high society at the time the flyer was made, that was added by someone else after. But Im glad the design stirred some controversy. Thats what we want, hence the name of our media group... Devious Designs... www.dvusdesigns.com
Club fliers all look the same
2008-10-11 14:57:00
I don't why everyone is upset about something that is obviously advertising a club. Everyone wants tits and ass at a club, so why not put it on a flier. Why does it matter what it looks like anyways? They all look the same... a bunch of stock photography cut out and paste together with a hot girl in the mix. Despite the lame typography, I'm just surprised the \"designer\" didn't put up a girl with bigger tits!

We aren't one to gossip, so the news of a friend's new relationship made us happy. Then a Little Birdy pointed out something cheeky about the picture, saying \"isn't he standing in Bamn?\" It sure looks like that to us. Either that is one hell of a Photoshop job, or he decided to take a press photo in the place you are least likely to find him. Either way, we wish him nothing but the best, and give him some quarters so he can feed his automat habit. We told you we were feeling feisty.

We may have been down, but certainly not out. It pained us to be away on such a special day, when our friends at GoaG somehow got their hands on some kind of online crayon operation and scribbled all over this craptastic image of Bungalow 8. Seriously, one of them is pointing to a planter. Right before taking a dig at our technical problems, our Midwestern word wizard waxed poetic about the return of Dungalow, saying \"I am bummed I missed out on the celebration, that I was told was “very much like the old Bungalow 8.” I imagine Bungalow was just as thrilled to have her walls filled with socials\". Longfellow it ain't. Anywhoo, We are back and feeling feisty, and that stuff is as lame as ever. But we already knew that.

A Little Birdy wound up unexpectedly at the Eldridge last week and was wowed by it's lameness. It's not the first time we have heard that, but then again, many midwesterners are reported to love it. What was so surprising is the second part of our LB's report, as they say \"I had to meet a friend at the Eldridge last week. The place was completely empty, except for their mascots Scott and Naeem, 2 girls, and a trumpet player that was blowing along to the DJ. It was terrible\". That's quite a Fashion Week drop off, NYSE style. But we think we have diagnosed the problem, and the solution is very easy. Skip the trumpet player and head over on Thursday when the flutist is in the house. Steelo!

Not sure if you went to Rose Bar when it first opened and heard the crickets, or checked out 1Oak when it was \"private\" for the first 4 months and you can hear a pin drop. I will be the first to say I didn't love the idea of The Eldridge, and it's pre-opening hype and buzz, I rarely go out anymore, used to be a fixture in the scene, but I have been going on a regular basis and I have to say, it is a great time, and have lived up to the hype. Naeem can be super tight at the door, maybe too tight (I have personally witnessed him pick out girls Studio 54 style) but once inside it is all models, celebrities, athletes, its a beautiful crowd in a small space. I can also say I haven't been there on a night when a trumpet (that sounds odd) is playing, each time I went it was a saxophonist. Next time let me be your \"little birdy,\" because this \"little birdy\" probably showed up when the doors open up.

I have nothing to do with Eldridge or Matt, in fact have never even been, don't really care to, and think that Matt comes off rather douche-y. But I will give the first commenter that Rose Bar was quiet at first, as was Bungalow 8 for like the first 6 months they were open. with all the talk of swipe card access prior to the opening, the exclusivity buzz was enough that many people never bother trying.

Matt, is clearly making posts. What a sick guy. Comparing Eldredge (which he doesnt really own, its still the same owner and SLA as the original bar in that location) to rosebar, bungalo, 1oak??? Those places tried to keep it tight, Eldrege is empty becase no one wants to go there and the is no one REAL behind it. you cant just \"open your Doors\" in NYC and be \"Tight\" You need to know good people to have good people. Rose =Schrager, Bungalo=Sacco, 1oak=Jah, ..... Eldredge= NO ONE!!! what a joke, eldredge and Citrine will be Identical commercial joints. Matt, and these other pretenders have Balls to call themself exclusive. Sine When??? No one knows them. Thats Like me calling myself Fabulous. I guess I am my own judge???

In response to Oak111 your argument would be much more persuasive if you actually knew how to spell the \"Eldridge\" not as you say the \"Eldrege\". In defense of Matt, yes he's a douche bag but he does have good connections, and so do his partners. I think with the economic turmoil and maybe too tight of a door that people are even scared to make it a destination, along with the completely overpriced drinks the Eldridge has great potential to be a complete flop.

@Flute - Rose Bar was quiet enough in the VERY beginning that I was getting regular texts from Frank to stop by. While not denying that many nightlife people chronicled here lend themselves to ridicule, it is also unfortunate that so many of you are so cynical to think that just because someone here might agree on a small point with Matt or on of the other posts, you immediately accuse that poster of being your target.Please consider for a moment that there are other voices here who are just weighing in innocently and have nothing to do with, nor give a rat's ass about your intended target.

The Eldridge has all the charm of any other overpriced, underpopulated, tasteless-in-its-excess new bar no one cares about on the lower east side. there is nothing aesthetically that makes this place remotely unique. Rose Bar has a beautiful, grand, and fascinating demeanor.. I've had a great time there on nights when it's packed, and on nights that it's completely empty. Same with Gold Bar, Beatrice, etc... whereas I don't think ANYTHING, with the exception of some really rare niche celebrity sighting, could possibly save this place.

Dropping Anchor at the Rusty Knot: Part IV

***CONTENT
Welcome to Part IV of our interview with Taavo Somer and Ken Friedman. In this final installment, Ken and Taavo discuss some of the backlash against the Rusty Knot, why it's not really a nautical theme dive bar, and why anyone really cares what it is. Enjoy! DBTH: What do you make of this debate around \"is this a dive bar\"? Taavo Somer: Yeah. There has been a lot made of the fact whether we are a dive bar or not. The reality is I was influenced by and grew up going to dive bars. Did no means did we ever think this would be a true dive bar. But if you look at how dive bars are usually organized, there’s some limited seating, there’s a good size bar and there is usually a pool table. And it has multiple areas with different functions. That was the extent of the influence of dive bars. And it probably will be 10 or 20 years from now. Ken Friedman: It will be a real dive bar. The problem is that in some interview, I referred to the Rusty Knot as a nautical themed dive bar. The backlash began that moment. People began saying “it’s not a real dive bar!” T: Real dive bars are like this! Well it’s like but when that dive bar opened up, the owners of Blue and Gold weren’t like let’s open the shittiest bar in the East Village. K: A filthy yucky dive bar. T: There were aiming high. Lets get alpine painting and there are some nice details in there. There are some nice details in there. Over the years it starts to take on its own character. I find it funny the immediacy of things. If you are designing something, a restaurant or architecture. I am thinking of it long term, 25 years and 50 years. I am not thinking it’s got to be an authentic dive bar on day 1. Do you have that luxury in a city with so much turnover? T: How many people these days, the places that are failing, are setting out to be a bar or restaurant in 25 years from now ... People are looking to take their money out in the first six months and flip it to some club owner in Dubai. They don’t give a shit about it being around in 20 years. So I think for us it’s a long-term thing, being in the neighborhood like with ken and the Spotted Pig, it’s about longevity. K: The coolest thing about this place is its really comfortable. A lot of the decisions Taavo made, design wise aren’t necessarily the most practical. This place really flows really well for being a boxy bar in an ugly boxy building. T: A story with the new barbershop that is kind of analogous to what has happened here in a way. We basically ran out of money at the end of doing the new barbershop. There was an existing sign that said Nick’s barbershop and hair salon so we had this funny idea that the neighbor that’s right next to us worked on signs for like no money was going to fix the sign to say FSC for us. We said sweet, because we don’t have to spend thousands a dollars and it will be done. So I, for whatever reason wrote down FCS instead of FSC. Sam looked at it and said that’s great. The guy, the night of the opening party, he brought it and tried to install it and we were like Oh my god it’s misspelled. Well, I guess we’ll just put it up and then he will replace it. But it was up for a week or two and all of these blogs were like, “oh hipsters are so lame. They are intentionally misspelling things, and all these comments were reading into it, but what we really did was just misspell our own name. And the sign guy didn’t catch it and we were waiting to get it fixed. Sometimes with the Rusty Knot, its like there really isn’t more to it.. we are a bar, were nautical, we’re by the water with boats, we have cheap beer, and its fun to be here. There is nothing more to it. K: We aren’t trying to teach people about new culture. People, through these blogs, wonder “what are they up to? What are they trying to say? What’s their message?” T: If it was really a nautical bar, it would be on the high seas. K: People said you aren’t a real dive bar. You haven’t been around for 100 years. T: Well come back to us in 100 years. K: In a hundred years, Taavo and I will be like “they’re not a real dive bar, we’re a real dive bar.” Well I will be like that; Taavo will be at the gym working out. T: If something’s misspelled, it’s just misspelled. And sometimes a bar with cheap stuff if just a bar with cheap stuff.

After weeks of being pummeled online by former employees and its many detractors and having the Community Board rail against their application for a liquor license renewal, owner Simon Hammerstein decided it was time to fight back. His weapon is a sit down with superstar Styles columnist Allen Salkin to say that these accusations are totally false, explaining “We don’t have a prostitution ring here.” That's good to know. Hammerstein and his partners have a 25 year lease for the Box, but the odds of them making it through at this rate are slim to none. Even though the show is always evolving, the club is not. New Yorkers are no longer showing the same interest in the venue, and we predict another year or two at most before the curtains close one last time. It's not that anyone is against the concept of a club with live performances, it's that customers don't really like the Box. There is a difference. [NY Times]

Only idiots with more money than sense pay what the Box requires. Oh - and guess what - lots of them are out their jobs or will at least be bonus-less this year. I work on Wall St. but can count the number of times I've bought a bottle or paid a cover greater than $20 on one hand. I do have to hand it to them - they thought of a good gimmick, and by charging a ridiculous amount of money for it, lured the aforementioned idiots in. But stuff like that has a short lifespan.

I know this is an old post but I have been hosting a debate watch event at the Tribeca Grand -we have a bar set up right outside the screening room. It's super nice and very popular since I've hosted it for all the debates, so I don't exactly need the publicity but just thought I'd mention. One of the comments here actually mentioned it -an invite from Tuesday's debate:watch is at the above URL. Just let me know if you'd like the final debate:watch invite. I additionally may be doing a result:watch event the night of November 4th -but I fear I'll be too nervous and freaking out to be around people ;)+melissa+

In Part III of our exclusive conversation with Taavo Somer and Ken Friedman, the owners of the Rusty Knot discuss the original name for the bar, the hype surrounding the opening, their patrons, and becoming a west side destination. Click here for previous installments.DBTH: You've been open for six months. What is the biggest surprise so far? Taavo Somer: Biggest surprise is Sunset. The original name was the Sunset Lounge because Ken loved it for the sunsets. I always imagined that we would be busy from 9, 10 o’clock until closing. When we opened, we got busy at 4:00, and 8:00 was the busiest time. We actually got a sunset crowd. Ken Friedman: People do want to do what I want to do, which is watch the sunset while getting a buzz on. T: I keep waiting for the pool table to develop a game. I went through the late 90’s Cherry tavern phase where it became a mini clubhouse. I played pool a couple of times a week and saw the same people. There was this pool scene. I keep expecting it to happen here but it hasn’t. Most nights I want to play I can just walk over and play. DBTH: You mentioned the Economic Stimulus plan for finance casualties. Did you expect this to become an afterwork hangout for bankers? T: No. But I didn’t know what to expect because I never hung out that much in the West Village. I live in the East Village and work there, the Lower East Side. So I 'm used to that bubble. I thought I would open this place with Ken and it would be the same people I m used to seeing from the Lower East Side. It was for a bit but the reality is that we are so far west that it’s just involved into a neighborhood place. K: Most neighborhoods draw from every direction. But no one comes east from here and not a lot of people live on the west side highway. It’s different than the Spotted Pig or Freemans where your customers come from there or there (pointing up and over). This is the ultimate destination – this is really a destination. Most everyone who comes here is taking a cab.DBTH: And are you happy with that? T: Thing I always imagined or fantasized about this place is that at 11:00 or midnight on Thursday night and there would be snow on the highway and plow trucks coming by and it just being the best place to hang out. But I like empty bars. K: Well if you are looking for an empty bar, you came to the wrong place Mr. Somer. T: I know. That would be another surprise. K: Maybe your wish will come true. Maybe we can start getting emptier and emptier. T: It’s a catch 22 because, with your friends, in the beginning they always wanna come here and then they come and it’s too crowded to get in. It’s like the famous saying “its so crowded no one goes there anymore. K: Yogi Berra DBTH: We have had that experience here, but its calmed down. T: That’s the goal. You can move around freely or sit and it if you want to. Just an easier and more manageable thing. Not a sweatbox.

In Part I of our exclusive interview with Taavo Somer and Ken Friedman, the Rusty Knot owners discussed their new menu, changing their hours of operation, and why they deep sixed the chicken liver and bacon sandwich. In Part II, Taavo and Ken discuss their new drink menu, why Ken is no good at tasting events, their own economic stimulus plan, and why mixing Red Bull and wine is a winning combination.DBTH: So you have a brand new drink menu. Was it always the plan to change with the seasons?Ken Friedman: It’s seasonalTaavo Somer: We switched on Monday, the 22ndWhat about the old drinks?T: We will see what we will do for the spring, if we get new drinks, but we will probably bring those back for the summer.K: Toby and Jason came up with the menu. We do these tastings but I get so drunk that I forget. Taavo remembers.Which ones are you really excited about?T: The Navy grog is great, and the red rum. The evolution was so great. We had the wine cooler in the summer, but how do we make the wine cooler more fall and winter. It was like a sangria without the fruit, which didn’t work. Someone said \"what about coke and red wine?\" Then someone said \"what about Red Bull and Wine?\"K: Why don’t we just go for it? What the hell? Why fuck around?T: Everyone was like ”that sounds horrible” and we were trying it and it was actually pretty good.K: We do have to scrape people off the ceiling at 4 AM.What's The Rusty Knot Economic Stimulus Plan?K: People complain about our Wall Street crowd at Sundown. People gave us a hard time about it but we love them. But then they all lost their jobs, so we are trying to figure out a way to get them back. So we came up with a pretzel dog and a Busch for $1. We haven’t figured out how to prove they are from Wall StreetWhat about bringing in their termination notice?T: Their pink slip!K: That’s a good idea. Maybe a free shot with a pink slip. The good thing is they aren’t wearing those ugly yellow ties. They are dressed normal.Update: The Rusty Knot's Navy Grog is made with Captain Morgan Spiced Rum, Creole Shrubb, Simple Syrup, House Made Sour Mix, Angostura Bitters, Regans Orange Bitters, Cinnamon, Cloves, Anise Stars

Yesterday, DBTH sat down with Taavo Somer and Ken Friedman for their first ever joint interview to discuss their bar, The Rusty Knot. The dream team looked back on the first six months, talk about the new food menu, new fall cocktail list, hours, discuss the public reaction and look ahead to the next 50 years of drinking along the West Side Highway. DBTH will bring this exclusive interview to you in several installments. In part I, we cover the kitchen and changes to the menu. Onward.DBTH: So we can see from looking at the menu that it is about 50% new. Taavo: Some things are going to go away as it gets colder. Shrimp cocktail is going to go, Pulled pork is going to go. Chicken liver is going to go. Iceberg wedge is going to go and the oyster may go.Ken: Pretzel dogs will never go. So you are six months in, is the plan working so far?K: Can we tell him? We can tell him.T: The one interesting thing, we are still tweaking everything. What we are learning, we thought we’d be open from noon-4 am. One of those bars where you know, who is going in there at noon and getting wasted? We thought we would grow into one of those bars where people would be here at noon. The reality is it’s shifting, where people want to eat at midnight, and we have been cutting it off at midnight. We are going to shift and open later and serve later, because that is the demand. We are trying to be responsive to what is happening and not dictate what is happeningK: We came out guns blaring with a restaurant menu and a dive bar. I pushed for that really hard. The reality is, people want to eat late. We’re packed until really late and we stopped serving food at 12. We should be serving food until the bitter end. So we are going to stop serving lunch, open at 4 and serve until 4.T: And the menu is going to be cut in half. For late night?T: No, for all the time. Just cut in half. A lot of these things will run until Sunday. K: Some of these things, like the Chicken liver, we all love it but it’s not selling. The PO Boy sandwich is a big seller. It’s like Tom Waits records.We love the chicken liver sandwich!K: Get one tonight because its going off the menu!

View Larger MapYesterday, our friends at Eater got word that Sasha Petraske's cocktail empire was crumbling underneath the weight of mounting losses caused by the Mercury Dime. According to Petraske, things are so bad at his 5th Street coffee house that it \" is practically bankrupting his other operations.\" We feel for Sasha, and truly hope that his wonderful other locations are not damaged, we couldn't help but notice how this tale is a microcosm of the current US economy. You see, Petraske was trolling along just find, earning a successful living with East Side Company, Milk and Honey and Little Branch. But then came this opportunity that he couldn't pass up, taking over the 5th Street carriage house and turning it into a Belgian beer and wine bar. His other risks had paid off, why not this one? So he does the deal, knowing full well that he would still need to deal with the dreaded Community Board. That obviously hasn't gone so well, and now the place is hemorrhaging money and dragging down the rest of his empire. Sound familiar? But unlike the large financial institutions, the federal government isn't going to come in and take this toxic deal off his books. At some point, Sasha will have to shut it down and the space will sit vacant until the CB is willing to grant anyone a liquor license. There do not appear to be any viable development scenarios for the space. We would think they would like an experienced operator, but what do we know? Until then, all we can do is watch and see if the tides turn.

Above is your first glimpse at Citrine, being opened by David Rodolitz in the former Snitch space in the Flatiron District. The space combines unique features like chandeliers, banquettes and shiny, mirrored walls. According to David, Citrine will be an \"exclusive club. It’s an amazing space and perfect for all types of private events.\" How exotic. Build-out is ongoing, but expect Citrine, which rhymes with latrine, to be ready to go by late October. When it opens, you can bet the crowd will be hot, the music perfect, and the door tight. That's the Citrine life.More Pics After the Jump

This is going to be a very good place. I am not saying its going to be bungalow or Cipriani downtown but, its a lock to be a smaller Tenjune. Which means you can keep out a lot of the filler types. The location is tough but the place holds 150 people. you can do a lot of good things in a small space you can't in a bigger space. I have heard a lot of things about the people involved and some of the events they already have booked. Also,If you look at some of the best spots in recent memory, they opened in shit neighborhoods. it doesn't matter where it is. its who is involved and how willing they are to stick to their plan. You can say whatever you want about Dave and Adam but, they won't panic. They don't need to because they can always make money with their crowd of \"jews\" as bobby put it. I don't know if Bobby has ever been to Tenjune, Marquee or any of the other very successful venues in the past 10 years but, who do you think was going there??

Every post here is a joke... I have no clue how this place will do... that obviously all depends on how hard these two \"next generation\" promoters work to become good owners and the staff they hire. What I do know is that the street will definitely not hold a place down. The place makes the street, the street does not make the place. Whether this place succeeds or not will come down to the little things... can it differentiate itself in some unique way? Time will tell...One thing these two kids do have is that they have never burned bridges and are honest, good people. If they are going to succeed, they are going to have to have to gain a killer instinct. I do recall Rodolitz getting a lot of press at some point within the last few years... timing is everything in this business and its unfortunate he couldn't parlay that into a launch at that time, but clearly the press likes him. I wish them luck

2008-09-25 14:19:00
interesting renderings. curious to see if it turns out to look that way. i agree with the above comment about the street. i don't think that really matters if the place is good and bc it is small that allows you to keep your door tight. my only thing is the entrance and majority of the club if i remember correctly is quite narrow. is anyone that is posting comments actually in the business or been in the business or are you all just club patrons?
For Real
2008-09-25 14:35:00
The place is a little narrow but, from what i understand it was completely gutted from snitch. I hear its a lot more open and the bathrooms have been moved. The bathroom situation at snitch was a disaster.

Did someone actually just say that this place would not succeed because they are jews and only know jews????Thats brilliantThe 3 best names in the game are of that stereotype - TEPPERBERG, STRAUSS AND DANNY A.Then you also have others like satsky who gets press and is in the same boatWhat an ignorant comment - at the top of the chain, behind all the celebs and behind every business there is often a member of the Tribe that is pulling the strings. Having these connections is what we will make them successful, not fail. \"Bobby\" is clearly just someone trying to tear the house down before it opens.Who knows if these two will succeed but if they don't it certainly won't be because of religion (for the record, I'm not jewish and i still recognize this)

Been in this game for years........you are clueless.Noah is the man However, I bet that he would have a vastly different opinion about what Danny A's value is. In fact, from what I hear (and i am in the business for years), you can expect them to open a venue together by the end of the year. I am not sure why Noah would partner with someone so useless. Either way why is this a conversation? Are we really pointing out all the successful Jewish promoters in NYC history? Most of the big ones are Jewish. What does that have to do with anything. Lets give \"Bobby\" the benefit of the doubt. He probably meant to say that these guys David and Adam have a Jappy crowd, which it seems they do. There is nothing wrong with that but, it hardly makes for an exclusive venue. however Noah who you call the man (The only thing you said that I agree with), started off doing Jappy parties. I think he has been able to parlay that into something bigger.Let's see what these guys can do.

To start, whoever it is that says Danny A is nothing, obviously doesn't know their facts. He is a key player in the nightlife industry both in NY and around the world. His relationships are incredible and he's a great businessman. Get your facts straight instead of putting down people who are pioneers in the industry. I assume you couldn't get into any of his parties for you to write such stupid comments.I know David and Adam and have been to many of their events the last couple of years. These 2 guys are straight up, are great at what they do and have a ton of great relationships. To what I hear, they've got incredible people involved to support them and work on the project. These 2 guys will do just fine with Citrine.

I hear what your saying \"For Real\", but the past few years these guys seem to have really branched out into a completly different crowd. They've gotten away from the typical \"jappy crowd\" and focused more on the venue, music, ect. Always have a great time at their parties and think this place will be a success. We shall see.....

Ella opens next, I know the guys. They have Plan B and also have GalleryBar, but, I think this place is on different levels. They make it happen in the East Village/LES. Do your homework people. From the look of the space last night, my boys are doing it right again.
Ella????
2008-09-26 09:43:00
Who the F cares about Ella? Its in alphabet city... its the most meaningless POS in the cityFocus people - Ella is in the same category as places like Taj, Mr West, Suzy Wongs, etc. Those places suckkkkkkkkk

It's not like the renderings and the actual space are going to be night and day! People here get that, and you insulting their intelligence well that makes you..... well for lack of a better words the idiot Fried Chicken & L'Shana Tova.

I was just there to see the space...it looks pretty close to the renderings...i like it and it has a lot of potential as long as as they have the right management, and promoters involved with the venue. I saw a list of private events which will push the venue along with the PR agency behind it. The place is going to do well...it has an edge because all the other clubs in the area are bellow avg (slate, duvet and porkeys), however Catch 22 has some buzz going around and having 2 good venues in an area will create that much more foot traffic between the 2 spots...Bungalow and Pink Elephant are in a very shitty location, however, Pink manages to pull a very high end clientele that spends at least $1500 to get a table...4 weeks ago Mike Ashley spent $216,000...not bad for a Wednesday night. Some of you talk about the bad economy ...well that is true, but if you are part of the avg joe clientele then yes the club wiill be affected - all Bridge and Tunnel and lower end clubs...but venues like Pink, Tenjune, Socialista, Rose Bar which are the cities top spots have a clientele that can afford to mingle in the clubs...they are not worried about the avg joe who's working in the mail room at some ibanking firm earning $60k a year who can't afford to spend $14 for a drink, get a table because their salary goes to paying NYC rent.

The people behind this club are solid, and whether it does well as a factor of the economy is out of their hands. However, you can wish them well, and come patronize the place. This weekend the club opens. They have opening night Thursday and the DJ lineup Thursday-Friday-Saturday is incredible. Todd Malis, DJ Paolo, Mel DeBarge, Vice, etc....unless you are a tool and can't get in. Then, for all your shit-talking, you will be wishing you actually knew Adam and David...

Rodolitz and Eisner are garbage. Shaun Rose and Pavan are trash too. They're arrogant pricks and fail everywhere they go.Noca --> FAILEDKush --> FAILED, and they got firedHome & Guest House --> It's ghettoRock Candy --> They FAILED.Nest --> HUGE FAILUREThey spend a ton of money on PR firms and all the PR firms & their agencies are having their interns write nice comments about them.The undeniable truth is that these people are insignificant and irrelevant.Citrine will fail, and has failed, just like every other one of their venues.The reason is very simple, they don't cater to their customers and have no thread of humility of customer service in them.They're all wannabes that don't possess the work ethic nor the desire or hunger to earn anything - rather they're just hoping to \"get lucky\" and be the next Tenjune.Adam's wife, Sachi, is a bitch too. No one ever wants to work with her.Plus, Impulse has virtually ZERO promoter relationships in this city. No one wants to work with them.Ryan Alovis left & he was a huge producer. They can't even keep their own staff of interns happy - hence why the interns left.Again, if you think these clowns are successful then you don't know nightlife.The best, and only, thing they have going for them is that they have Jon Gabel's trust in them. Without that they'd already have disappeared.Regardless of Gabel's support, Adam, Shaun, David and Pavan's death has been slow and will continue until no one cares about them.

After doing a Beatrice Inn expose that resulted in he and his brother supposedly being banned for life, Observer reporter George Gurley has found a new home at Doubles, which could be considered the Beatrice of a different era. The club, in the basement of the Sherry-Netherland Hotel, went through a major renovation over the past year and just reopened last week, attracting boldfaced names such as Valentino Samsonadze, Tom Britt, and Debbie Bancroft. This was one opening George simply couldn't miss, or maybe the only one he could go to after his scandalous take down of the secretive Beat. We weep for you, buddy.

David Jaffee is more than a promoter. David Jafee is more than on staff at the soon to be renovated Cain. He also has his own Facebook group. A real triple threat. The Jaff says:We're directly responsible for throwing the absolute best parties in NYC. Attractive crowd, great music, celebs., sports figures, great times :-).There seems to be a trend where people start up a Facebook account, friend a few hot girls, and then call themselves a promoter.....You should deal with the best and most professional....as opposed to wasting your time with amateurs.The fact is.... NO ONE CAN PROVIDE YOU WITH BETTER ACCESS, VIP TREATMENT, REDUCED BOTTLE MINIMUMS, COMPS, ETC. IN BOTH NEW YORK CITY AND MIAMI THAN DAVID JAFFEE.Professional service, VIP treatment and perfect execution.We also hate those fake ass hustler wannabe's who start FB pages and then call themselves a promoter. Who do they think they're fooling? Fools! Only trust the best. Only trust the Jaff!

Lol I wish I had this resume...About me: Straight from Myspace- www.myspace.com/davidjaffeeI'm a big nerd yet incredibly motivated to be the best...ever...and i work wayyy too much but i can't help it, and i actually like it...relatively unemotional and even-tempered....I'm VERY results-oriented... i do not like to say much about what i'm going to do, rather I just do it... talk is cheap.. I'm not materialistic at all and do not really buy designer clothes....i judge people on their character and what they've accomplished, not by who they appear to be....many would say that i'm a \"machine\".. some would call me ruthless, and i am in many respects, but not in a bad way - it's just not good to get on my bad side..I have about 7 great friends...I've known my best friend since i was 3 years old and i love him as if he’s my biological brother....I tend to be closest to those that I grew up with in Monticello, NY (even if i wasn't overly close with them while growing up), I have problems befriending new people because I'm always wary of their true intentions.Graduated from an Ivy League University at the age of 20. I'm currently an investment banker in midtown, was promoted early and work directly with the chairman of the ~300 person company on investment banking sell-side executions, IPOs, private placements and also assist in managing a fund with $200M in equity....More interestingly, i work as a club promoter for the most exclusive venues in NYC. I simply enjoy doing what many people would characterize as \"work\".I live in Midtown Manhattan. My parents just moved to their beach house in Florida so i'll be down there a lot more often.I'd like to meet everyone. I love meeting new people. Regarding women, I find myself attracted to intelligent, ambitious, beautiful, kind and fun people. Kindness is very important to me, as my mother is the nicest and most selfless person that I know, and I love her more than anyone or anything in the world. Possessing motivation to succeed and achieve your potential is also very important to me. I like cool and very chill girls (no divas plz). Someone that is comfortable wearing sweat pants with her hair up when chillen at my place but can also be classy and stunning when we go out. I don't like girls that tell me where they bought their clothes and “brag” for shopping at Barney’s, Sachs, Zegna, Prada, Gucci, etc...my friends and i used to hustle $8 sweat pants at Wal-Mart by switching the price tags from a smaller size so that we’d get them for $5.50, and they’re telling me about a pair of $400 jeans? Also, i like girls that are reliable and someone that follows-up and does what she says she'll do. Just be true to yourself, I'm sure if you like yourself then I'll like you too.

Pretty classy guy. Tag switching sweatpants at Wal-Mart? At least he got an early start on \"hustling\" people (his words, not mine). This is a great example of everything that's wrong with the state of nightlife in New York. I wish W. 27th would just fall into the Hudson and float over to New Jersey, where it belongs (and take him with it).

Cool. I love how there are so many haters. It's only 1-2 competing promoters that aren't successful and are unhappy with their lives. They hate me cause they're bullshitters and posers and I've called them on it, so they attack me online, while hidden behind multiple screen names, cause they think it'll hurt me.Because they're irrelevant, they want to portray an image that I'm a bad person or that I've done something wrong. When, in reality, they're just jealous of my success.It's actually flattering that people care about my life. Everyone on here that claims to know me is lying. Fat-Twinkie Eating Bruno Orlando does not know me. The other BS promoters on here that get 17 year old FIT girls drunk and think that they're important - you guys don't know me.I do appreciate your efforts though. If it wasn't for you taking such an interest in my life then I may not have ever ended up on these paparazzi sites!Fortunately, the reality of the situation is that these haters will likely never be successful or happy. And, more importantly, there will continue to be an increasing disparity between the success I experience in my life and what they experience in theirs :)Thanks again for taking an interest in my life! I hope to see everyone at our parties.Latest newsletter:http://www.davidjaffee.com/events.htmWebsite:http://www.davidjaffee.comDavid

just b/c you dont like his style of promoting, doesnt mean you guys have to hate on him. he is an accessible hookup to people who aren't in the loop but still want to go out to these spots. hey man, if you are making money having a good time, and are happy doing it, whats the problem?
yack yack
2008-09-26 13:38:00
I'm not sure why everyone is hating on Jaffee. If you've ever met him, he is genuinely a nice kid and is not one of those promoters who says he'll hook you up with free bottles or drinks just to get you to come to the club and then not deliver. If he is there, he is always gracious.Now I will agree that the places he is currently promoting may not be the places that many of us who actually know the difference in good nightlife in NY, but 4 years ago when he started doing it, they were the places to be and we all know we have been to these places (which is why we hate them so much now). But that being said, as shitty as these places may be, there is still clearly a market for it (people new to the city who simply don't know any better and the B&T).All in all, from my experiences in working with him, he has been really cool and laid back.Oh, and he does work for a bank as I had to meet him at his offices one day.And if you have ever been to Monticello, you would commend him for ending up as successful as he is...trust me, NO ONE in Monticello has a trust fund. The place is about as po-white-trash as it gets (no offense Jaffee), with rusty cars in the front yards and above ground pools in the back.I'm actually shocked at how he can promote while working full time...he is out almost 6 nights a week, and probably works 6 days a week.Keep at it man.

One accurate thing that you DID write, or at the very least it MAY be accurate, is that i'm banned from Home & Guest House.No one's ever told me that and I was BSing with the Home doorman this past Saturday while waiting for a table to open up at Cain so my friends and i could get seated.But yeah, i may be cause i got into an argument with the owner buttttt..... we actually spoke this weekend via email cause it's not in anyone's best interest to have beef in this industry cause we all know this is a business and it's about $$$$ and good businessmen know that silly disagreements should never persist when there's an opportunity to continue to make $$$$.So yeah, that's the one thing that you wrote that's potentially half accurate. lol.CONGRATS!!! :-)David

The Observer went right to the State Liquor Authority to discover that despite community protests, the Beatrice Inn has had it liquor license renewed. Unless a violation occurs, the Beatrice Inn have its doors open until at least August 31, 2010. Why did the SLA approve when the local Community Board gave a negative recommendation? It turns out that the Beatrice has not violated the terms of its license, which is a prerequisite for nixing a renewal. Go figure. It's nice to know that the SLA is considering the manner in which a business operates as the basis for license approval, rather than its neighbors opinions of said business.

Actually, the State Liquor Authority slipped the Beatrice's renewal through BEFORE the Community Board's recommendation was submitted and, indeed, well before the August 31st renewal date. Typical state government operations: no concern for local needs or proper procedure; only seeking the licensing fee.Moreover, time for public comment was violated by the Beatrice's strategic move of \"laying over\" it's July Community Board hearing until the next month, when it was too late SLA-wise.

Grab the Kleenex brand tissues, because we have some sad news to report. This will be the final week for Cain. We know it's devastating but you must stay strong. We will get through this together. Jamie Mulholland put his friends on blast that Cain will be closing as of Friday, saying \"I know you have all been a huge part of our success and have had many a good night at the venue. Please come and help us celebrate our closing night with us this Friday evening at Cain one last time.\" Sorry if we tear up here, but it is sad. Cain followed the Marquee wave, setting up shop in far west Chelsea. We believe their run of success ranks them right there with Marquee, and they have gone on to other projects. Congratulations for shutting it down on their own terms. Pour one out for Cain. UPDATE: Is Cain not dunzo? According to a Little Birdy on the inside, \"Cain is still very much alive and is going to maintain a strong presence in NYC after undergoing a complete renovation at it's existing location.\" Now we are really confused. One says this Friday is the last night, and now there are rumors of a Cainovation. Time to get sleuthing.

Cain is closing to renovate for either 3-4 weeks or the entire fall. It is definitely not closing for good. The renovation is just a face-lift, nothing major to my knowledge...3-4 weeks is not a long time but it could be a full blown renovation if it doesn't open til the winter.

I have heard for a while that they are shutting down for a good month, I though it was going to happen at the end of August. I was told that they plan on making the dance floor even height as some of the tables and the bar. Which is a bummer, because the lowered dance floor was always fun. I was also told that they are changing the African theme. Don't worry the drummers will stay thank god.

It's amazing to me how late this post came and how inaccurate it was and still is. Cain is most definitely closing, but only to renovate and recreate the image that it once had & make the right changes in order to move forward. The DJ booth will be moved to the opposite side of the room and it will no longer be two levels (dance floor & bar level) it will be one level. The door will be MUCH tighter, so those of you who may have graced the South African game den under 'David Jaffee's List' most likely won't make it back after this week. Any previous reputation a given promoter may have had with the venue will most likely cease to exist as even Steve Kasuba (who was there from the beginning and ran their promotions) is no longer with the Cain team. The reason they remain on 27th st? Well they were fighting with a community board to attain a liquor license that went past 2 AM for a space on Broadway in TriBeCa (where the Alexander Wang after party was held, which by the way was the hottest party of fashion week, literally) which seems to have fallen through. So instead of moving to a new space and having a 2 AM closing time they chose to remain on 27th st and make the necessary changes to recreate the image the venue once had and draw the 'right' crowd back. How you ask? Well by hiring not only a new promotional / creative director who will remain unnamed but an entirely new promotions team to go along with it.Cheers.

In response to tc... The party during fashion week was the afterparty for Alexander Wang, the only thing that related it to Cain was that the party was held in the space where Cain was going to move on Broadway in TriBeCa had they been able to attain a liquor license that went past 2 am. As far as what's going to happen after Cain re-opens... Well, all I can say is that it can only get better from here.

View Larger MapIt occurred to us over the weekend that the City's nightlife landscape has transformed itself once again. Up until last year, the Manhattan scene was clearly dividided between the psuedo-dives of the Lower East Side and the nightclubs of the Meatpacking District and 27th Street. We know that there are smaller pockets of hotspots in other neighborhoods, and that the East Village still has a plethora of places to get sloshed. But for all intents and purposes, it was LES vs MePa in a battle for our drinking money. But as we walked down the Bowery on Saturday night to attend a small gathering at Madam Geneva, it hit us. The Bowery has become a powerhouse destination of its own. Just look at this handy map we made. There are at least 15 bars in a 3 block radius that are packed every weekend, and we are sure that we missed a few. Add in the new hotels, high rise condos, New Museum, pending Dennis Keith McNally restaurant, Daniel Boulud's new spot, Matt and Paul's pending space in the Puck Building etc., it will hit you too. The Bowery is nightlife. It's where operators want to open, and where New Yorkers can sip expensive drinks and still step over the homeless who are sleeping outside the Mission. It's feaux authenticity that the youth crave. The Bowery. Shudder.

Too many bars on that one stretch. The traffic in the neighborhood is now backed up for miles.The Bloomberg administration could have dealt with this problem intelligently, by beginning the 2nd Avenue construction on the Bowery while it was being demolished and rebuilt anyway (which is NOW). Instead, they start on the Upper East Side, where the damned thing is not nearly as necessary.Also, while they've torn up the neighborhood anyway: bury Delancey/Kenmare Street in the block east of Bowery, and have it re-emerge on the West Side at Varick, so the Long Island-Jersey traffic doesn't have to bring the whole area to a standstill.I mean, Hello, Dept. of Transportation, anybody home?

Faux, not feaux.And as long as the idiot hordes don't stray east to my beloved stip of 2nd Avenue dives, I'm happy to know exactly which places to avoid. Also, to echo an earlier statement, most if not all of these places SUCK and several have been around for years if not decades.

It's swimsuit model Jessica Gomes birthday. She decided to let Tenjune pay her a fee for partying there, and Tenjune will make its money back by getting some of you to pay money for bottles and/or admission. That's how you generate money in a declining economy. That's how you stay in the game. That's how you rise to the top. That's how you become Flyer Follies. Happy birthday Jessica. UPDATE: Tenjune's reps at Shadow PR adamantly deny paying Jessica Gomes any money to appear at Tenjune. Apparently they are hosting this shimmy out of the goodness of their hearts. Sweet.

A Little Birdy forwarded us David Jaffee's NYC Nightlife news letter and it gave us quite the chuckle. It seems David is now \"in-house, and on-staff, at Cain\". Translation? He can hook you and your friends up. All you have to do is say you are on David Jaffe's list. But if it seems almost too good to be true, give yourselves a hearty pat on the back. David warns: The house doormen will do their absolute best to accommodate everyone, but because Cain is so exclusive, they will have to turn many people away - even some on our guest list. Groups of guys must purchase bottles; kindly contact me for table reservations. Please try to arrive between 11:00 p.m. and 11:45 p.m., and in smaller groups, to maximize entry potential without being asked for a table purchase.So if you are a group of guys and don't want to purchase a bottle, just show up one at a time and pretend you are buy yourself. If you don't like that idea, head over to Prime where you know that bottles aren't required. And don't forget to let them know who sent you.

Is there a fee or can I just lock down the table?Prime: U can lock down a table no prob what's the rsvp underGrub Street: nice it'll be under Russ Hanes, so no minimum charge for the table or bottle minimum or anything?Prime: How many guys???Grub Street: 5Prime: I NEED NAME AND HOW MANY BOTTLES AND HOE MANY PEOPLE THANKSGrub Street: It'll be under Russ Hanes, 5 people, 1 bottle? 11pm on Fri?Promoter: WE R AT PRIME ON SATURDAY ON FRIDAY WE R AT GUEST HOUSE WHICH NIGHT DO U WANT TO GO OUTGrub Street: oh looking to go to prime, so i guess that'd be saturday night, 11pm.Promoter: OK SO LETS TRY THIS AGAIN (CAUSE IM FORWARDING THIS TO MY BOTTLE HOST) WHAT NAME DO U NEED THE RSVP UNDER AND HOW MANY PEOPLE AND HOW MANY BOTTLES NOTE 5 PEOPLE IS 2 BOTTLES MINIUMEGrub Street: oh damn sorry, didn't know there was a bottle minimum. i dont know if we can kill two bottles. we're not the most experienced drinkers bro....Given the promised \"renovation of the club's attitude\" (\"the new club will be built around a new and simple concept 'to cater to the customer'\") we were hoping to get a message back — maybe something along the lines of “NO SWEAT I GOT U, JUST SHO UP + HAVE A GOOD TYME” — but nada. A classic case of no money, no honey. It’s like the place has turned back the clock to September 14, 2008!!Update: We were eventually told that we could go to Guest House if one bottle was all we wanted. Our dreams of throwing down at Prime were crushed.

Wow. Such drama. I wonder why people find my life so interesting.This is just a rehash of when Bruno Orlando attempted to put me down on Jossip cause his 250 lb. lard-infested body didn't get a Jenny Craig sponsorship. I've heard that Jared from Subway is moving onto bigger and better things; Bruno, maybe you can lobby Subway to pay for your liposuction and get you in their commercials. Or at least they can pay for your gym membership so that you can have access to a treadmill.Lets be clear here with actual facts, not BS / inaccurate information from jealous individuals with the sole intent of putting someone else down to make themselves feel better and pacify their inferiority complex:1) We run parties, unlike Bruno who can't even get into clubs A. Bruno, remember when you weren't even let into Lotus? Nobody knows who you are. Hating on me will not make you skinny.2) We generate significant revenue A. I don't know of another promoter that's more profitable and/or brings out more people on a consistent basis. Even so, i don't really care about other promoters, rather i'm focused upon fulfilling my obligation to my employers.Posting false and inaccurate comments are going to hurt me. Again, your time is best spent focusing on YOU and YOUR business:-) The only way you'll be successful is by working hard. I'm sure that you're bitter because you've failed in your previous attempts to be relevant and are upset that you're a nobody....but... again, hating on me will not make you successful.I hope to see you out at our parties though - as I've done in the past, I'll be happy to pay you out on the 10 people that you bring.All the best, Davidhttp://www.davidjaffee.comP.S. Also, why aren't people posting under their real names? Instead they're making up posts using the names of clubowners in the city - and then spelling the names incorrectly. AT LEAST spell the names right in your attempt to appear credible when authoring a fake post! People know the truth. They're not ignorant and they know a liar / poser when they see them. The reason why Bruno is not successful in life is because he has hatred in his heart and lacks the discipline to work hard.

Impress all your friends with your ultra-coolness by dropping $300-$500 on a bottle! Pose in front of your friend's camera next to a below average girl (in way too much makeup) and brag to your friends later about all the models you were hanging out with Saturday night.

Cool. I love how there are so many haters. It's only 1-2 competing promoters that aren't successful and are unhappy with their lives. They hate me cause they're bullshitters and posers and I've called them on it, so they attack me online, while hidden behind multiple screen names, cause they think it'll hurt me.Because they're irrelevant, they want to portray an image that I'm a bad person or that I've done something wrong. When, in reality, they're just jealous of my success.It's actually flattering that people care about my life. Everyone on here that claims to know me is lying. Fat-Twinkie Eating Bruno Orlando does not know me. The other BS promoters on here that get 17 year old FIT girls drunk and think that they're important - you guys don't know me.I do appreciate your efforts though. If it wasn't for you taking such an interest in my life then I may not have ever ended up on these paparazzi sites!Fortunately, the reality of the situation is that these haters will likely never be successful or happy. And, more importantly, there will continue to be an increasing disparity between the success I experience in my life and what they experience in theirs :)Thanks again for taking an interest in my life!

Uncle Steve sits down Hayne Suthon, owner of Lucky Chengs, to discuss the good old days and what not. Suthon also drops that Lucky's is moving to Times Square, since the Asian bistro and drag show has become a magnet for tourists and bachelorette parties more than anything, so going to the City's Mecca for tourists and bachelorettes makes perfect sense. To make the move happen, Lucky's has enlisted Uncle's help, who says:As a hospitality designer, I’m helping you find a space in Times Square for Lucky Cheng’s. I’m pretty sure we have one right now so yes - we might be announcing it on this blog in the months to come. You’ll be moving this to Times Square which will be a true tourist space. It will definitely be more fun than ever.The space will of coure be bigger, badder and draggier than ever. And more expensive. Seriously, we are happy that Lucky Cheng's business is doing so well that it can make the move uptown. We are also happy that it will be bringing its legions of tourists and bachelorette parties with them. Walking past the restaurant on a weekend night is like walking through a gauntlet of cheese. You know what we mean. You know.

Looking to keep the good times rolling, we popped by Madam Geneva to see what all the jam was about. We found a beautifully design space, very intimate with plenty of seats at the bar and 5 or 6 couches with rounded ends for groups. The couches were custom made for the space with a feux snake skin material for that extra snakey sheen. We saddled up to the bar and perused the cocktail menu, finding a few reds, a few whites, some choice beers and just 3 cocktails featuring jam. Each cocktail starts with a base of gin or vodka, some fresh squeezed lemon juice, and your choice of three seasonal jams. We went with ginger pomegranate and gin. We have to say, it was delicious in its simplicity. The gin was most prevalent, and the flavor of jam came through at the end. We only had one, but could certainly see ourselves having a few more. And we will, since the Madam fashions herself as a local spot to enjoy cocktails into the wee hours. No list. No BS. Nice work by the AvroKo team.

2008-09-18 16:44:00
Anyone ever wonder how DBTH makes money? It kind of baffles me, although I'm not an insider in the blogging world, I was always under the assumption that advertising was the main source of income. I have yet to see anyone advertise on DBTH. I guess maybe the advertisement is coming through the article or blogs they write. Hence, a restaurant pays them for the publicity whether good or bad.

Courtesy of New YorkWe conducted a mini tour of some new spots last night. Stop one was at Apotheke, Albert Trummer and the Tierney family's new cocktail den in Chinatown. We were wowed. Bowled over even. Apotheke is more than just a bar; it's a cocktail laboratory where Trummer and his crew tinker with exotic flavors and spirits to create some outstanding drinks. This is mixology at its zenith. We saddled up to the bar and watched Albert grab small jars and bottles and mix in a test tube, and then pour samples for anyone who was lucky enough to grab some space in front of him. He even opened some champagne with a knife! How daring. We sampled a delicious habiscus sidecar, some kind of fennel and gin concoction, and a muddled grape, Proseco and red bull mix up that had our mouth tingling. The bar has a great design, great music, and perhaps most importantly, an abundance of staff and bartenders buzzing around to make sure everyone is taken care of. We didn't stay long, but will be returning shortly to settle in and make a night of Apotheke's concoctions.

With Fashion Week safely in the rear view mirror, we wanted to recap one of the more interesting parties that went down and felt oh-so atypical. While the same celeb scenesters seemed to be running from one soiree to the next trying to be caught by the photogs, it was refreshing for once to see a celeb appearance more out of the ordinary. Life Aquatic co-stars Bill Murray and Seu Jorge reunited at designer Carlos Miele's fashion week party hosted by Sagatiba cachaca at Espasso gallery. Seu Jorge serenaded the crowd, including Bebel Gilberto as caipirinhas flowed. Seu Jorge, who sang the accoustic David Bowie renditions in the film has been touring with Bebel and Thievery Corporation.

While a fun night out is a memory you try to cherish forever, the resulting hangover is something we all would immediately like to forget. Not an easy task. On Food Detectives, the somewhat grating Ted Allen investigates scientific ways to eliminate a hangover. Allen and his scientific buddy investigate five classic options: coffee, water, greasy food, tomato juice, and vodka. Yummy. The very un-scientific results show that drinking water will of course cure your alcohol related dehydration problems, and the vodka helps actually delay the symptoms of a hangover. And while it won't eliminate your hangover, a quick \"hair of the dog\" will push it back a few hours. So what did we learn? Not much, except we aren't going to watch Food Detectives ever again.

AvroKo's Double Crown made it through its friends and family period and opened to the public on Monday. Head over to our friends at Eater for a looksee. Also opened is Madam Geneva, the separate basement lounge which we told you would feature gin cocktails and proper sandwiches into the wee hours of the morning. Man about town Alex Balk stopped by and reports: Was at this bar last night where the cocktail gimmick is “jam.” They take a gin and citrus beverage and stir in one of three or four varieties of jam. I can’t remember what they all were, probably because I had about nine of them, but there was a coriander and ginger one that was actually quite nice. The drinks were actually much better than you’d expect given the description, and the whole patter about how “as the jam becomes part of the cocktail it gives a deeper complexity” was more or less true. Either way, the only thing I can taste in the back of my mouth this morning is jam, which is unpleasant. Also? I feel like I’m going to crap out a scone. That sounds delicious Alex. And nasty. We may just have to make a trip to see the jam doctor later this week.

We loved reading Vanity Fair's fall guide to Manhattan. While we will leave it to our friends to nitpick over their favorite (and somewhat incestuous) restaurants, we were particulary intrigued by their choice of nightspots. Not that we disagree with their choices. It's more that their list is a bit deceiving. Most everyone knows that while Rose Bar has a number, it will not help you make a reservation. The number VF provided for the Beatrice Inn leads to a dead end fax machine. We aren't even going to touch the Box. So we feel sorry for Vanity Fair's loyal readers who thought they really were getting an inside tip on how to live the high fallutin Manhattan life. Maybe next year.

Mark this day in your calendars, because September 16, 2008 is officially the day that bottle service died in Manhattan. At least thats what JE Engelbert thinks, and he is putting his club where his mouth is. In another sizzling press release, JE says that his renovated club Prime will no longer cater to bottle service patrons, saying: With the new Prime comes a new attitude and a new goal creating pleasure for the customer and making the party a fun party. Admission will no longer be driven by bottle sales. If someone looks good enough to get in and comes with the right attitude, they will get in without bottles.That's nice to hear, but won't these just be the same people that were coming to Prime to buy bottles? And what if a customer wants to buy a bottle to impress someone? JE has an answer for that:Of course we will still sell bottles and offer bottles to anyone who wants them but the business model will not be based solely on the idea of extorting bottles at the door.Fabulous. And what about customer service? Will your customers be treated any differently now that the bottle service era is finished?the goal is to create an environment where the customers can go out to a fun place on Saturday nights without getting raped or abused at the door . . . In an era where NYC clubs treat customers like enemies and adversaries we feel this is a new and novel approach that will work extremely well.There you have it. The era of bottle service is officially over, unless you want a bottle, and customers will no longer be raped or abused at the door on Saturday nights. The other nights of the week may be full of abuse, but we will wait for another press release for clarification.

Someone bought 200,000$ worth of bottles last week. Mansion, was sold out sat night( 60 + tables)Home KILLED it last weekend.( well stabbed it !! lol)Marquee is on fire.The only thing that is over is JE Englebart. Time to start making fagitas my friend ,. You have lost all credibility in this business and obviously can not start a trend if you wanted to. So, basically, ATTENTION ALL BROKE ASS MOTHERFUCKERS!!! GO TO PRIME!And, wasnt prime just shut down for 15 days??? FOR SERVING BOTTLES TO UNDERAGE GIRLS!!!LAUGHABLE.this guy has seriously fallen off the cocaine bandwagon.

2008-09-16 13:18:00
hahahha can I just respond the third poster who makes the claim that someone spent 200k at PE? How can you possibly do this in one night, and also the claim the Marquee is on fire. Worst place in New York City, it's like being jammed into a cattle car. And that Home is killing it, did i miss something was there a stabbing here? Because Home, and Marquee have never been cool, and PE is marginally ok. I'm glad the Guido B&T crowd are still buying bottles here.
You're stupid
2008-09-16 13:20:00
haha even better I forgot to mention his mentioning of Mansion being sold out to New Jersey B&T losers who are ruining nyc nightlife. They are the reason that the doors are so tough, because no one wants them in any club unless they are a bad establishment just trying to make money

You're Stupid......You are Stupid. Someone did spend 200K + last week at Pink Elephant. The bill was on the cover of the london sun. You can spend that much by buying 200+ bottles of champagne and sending it to the entire club. Bottle service will always be around at the high end venues but, as people have less money you will start seeing a trend back to the big nightclub. JE might be right but, it ain't gonna happen at prime.

its true i was there and the guy was chairman of a uk soccer club and he did spend 234k to be exact..hey noone said he drank it ...he sprayed it on people ...and so did others arond him ..pink ran out of cristol ...yes it was in the uk paper the sun with the check..bottle service is not over ..but the idea that bottle service is cool and exclusive has been over for years ....you can't buy culture ..and spending a couple k does not make u a class act or mean u will be sitting in a club with a classy crowd ....it more likely means in nyc that u will probaly hear the radio a lot and not be very forward thinking place...unless u call counting tables and bottles as most important thing about a club ...and sitting with girls who say there models but dont even have a agent ..or book .

We loved walking into the Mini Rooftop for the first time, a truly unique space that gave us an extra week of outdoor love before the weather turns colder. Seeing the Standard NYC was nice, even though it is still a construction site and probably will be for a few more months. Perry and Dave Navarro's late night set at Rose Bar was amazing, as was seeing Keith Richards at Rose Bar the next night at Radar's Hearts On Fire event that Alexandra & Theodora Richards and Liv Tyler Dj'd. A much sexier trio than the MisShapes ever could be. And the clothes! We actually didn't see anything we like. Go figure. Until next year.

It will still be open, buit a follow inspection will be coming soon.

Can a bar be considered a dive bar without a bit of bathroom damage? Probably not. A Little Birdy snapped a pic of the bathroom at the Rusty Knot, where a patron decided to scratch a little something into the painting that hangs in the stall. How considerate. But this will help speed up the aging process for the nautical themed bar on the West Side highway, helping fortify the aesthetic.

Last night DBTH headed to the bowels of Chelsea for the DSquared launch of he and she wood fragrances. So tres chic. Inside the ex industrial building that now houses offices of only the hippest sort, we were transported via manual elevator to the mainly empty top floor, where we learned that the real party was on the rooftop. Perfect evening for mingling under the starry sky with the city as a backdrop with loads of bitchy gay hipsters, trannies, and male models. Though we had already drank our fair share earlier in the evening, the champagne + vitamin water signature drink was a surprise hit (or maybe we were already too tipsy to care). All in all, chill yet standard fashion week fare: see and be seen. And the fragrances themselves weren't too bad. Regift city fer sher. Fer sher.

Two weeks ago, I was able to get a reservation with the 718.#$%.^&*( number. I texted them yesterday to get a reservation, and I never got a response, so I called the number and discovered it was a non-working number. Hopefully they just changed the number to minimize the riff-raff.\" Did you ever consider that maybe you are the riff raff they want to minimize? Just kidding LB. Thanks for the heads up.

A weak marketing blitz pays off for Mr. West. After bombarding our in box with anonymous tips, we can proudly say that construction on the new lounge on West 22nd has finished just in time, and they will be prepared to host the Zac Posen party tonight as Fashion Week begins to wrap up. Mr. West, along with the Standard Hotel and Cooper Square Hotel, went into overdrive to host an event this week, but is this really a successful strategy? Is it better to kill yourself to bring in a bunch of fashion freeloaders, or would these venues be better off taking their time to make sure they get it right? After all, there is nothing more important than a first impression. Only time will tell for the two hotels, which are long term investments. But for bars like Mr. West, it seems that throwing a good fashion week event could possibly lead them down a successful course. Or doom them to failure and ridicule.

Any press is good press but good point on the fashion freeloaders. Especially parties like Zac Posen, etc. I have worked many of those parties over the years on the service side and management side, and besides getting a small clip on page 6, you get nothing out of it except a big headache and huge negative on your inventory. It definitely wont guarantee your spot to pop. The face person, promotional director, and service does.

Just a few weeks after declaring itself New York's most exclusive nightclub, El Bano has already been outdone by New York's latest bastion of exclusivity. Behold El Evator, \"the most exclusive elevator club in the entire world!\" El Evator features drinks \"mixed by a nuclear scientist in a sealed lab . . . in Munich, Germany\", as well as a full, pig heavy menu by Executive Chefs Jimmie Dean and Marie Callendar. To find El Evator's location, you must simply solve the equation posted on the website. Seems simple enough. El Evator is slated to open during Administrative Assistants week in late September. When asked for comment, the management of El Bano said \"El Evator? Is that supposed to be a joke? We've worked too hard to deal with this.\" This is more exciting then the potato sack race we saw in Prospect Park last summerClick through to read El Bano's entire statement after the jump. The only people that think we are fake are New York bloggers who think they are much smarter than they are. We've gotten LITERALLY thousands of emails since we launched our site. Everyone from the biggest fashion houses in the world to celebrities BEGGING to get a key to get in. We're quite flattered and we've had a great time opening the club this fashion week. I guess people can say we are fake because we have been extremely elusive when it comes to details on our location and who's behind the club. I guess it's easier to say we don't exist, and to our exclusive clientele, this is probably a good thing. As for the other \"exclusive\" clubs in New York that have popped up recently. I've been following, and surprise, I've been to them all. I think the level of celebrity that has been to our competition is in the league of Bea Arthur. I use the term competition loosely because it's amateur hour in New York these days. Gracias, ManagementThere you have it.

Last night, we were invited to attend a little anniversary party for Rose Bar. It was just two short years ago that Ian, Nur and the entire team unleashed their vision on New York City, and the place is just as strong as ever. There was a legitimate mob scene outside last night, with Damion announcing \"if you aren't on Nur's list, you are not getting in\". Good thing for us, we were on the list. We made our way inside and the place was packed. Beyond packed. So packed that as we tried to walk to the back bar, we got so stuck that we could not advance in any direction. We finally decided to push our way to the front, where we graciously accepted several tasty cocktails from the open bar. We saw club owners, actresses, musicians, reality TV stars, them, her and everyone else, including the always effervescent Corynne Steindler. The highlight of our night was the special live performance by Perry Farrell and Dave Navarro, who manuevered through the crowd to play a few songs. Towards the end, Perry wondered \"when did everyone get so fashionable? Remember when we all dressed like freaks?\" Deep. Congratulations to Rose Bar on turning two. We can't wait to see what happens when you turn three.

rose bar is a decent place, great ambience and decor. but the quality of women is pretty low, at least compared to any good club/bar in los angeles or miami. hate to say it, but NYC just doesn't have a lot of hot women. just a bunch of anorexic chicks who chain smoke, wear expensive clothes and think they're \"gorgeous.\"

According to Open Table, AvroKo's newest restaurant Double Crown will be open for business as of Tuesday the 16th. Good news for all. We also learn that the separate basement lounge will be called Madam Geneva, which was what gin was called in England when the spirit was first introduced in the 18th century. The Madam will serve \"delectable tea sandwiches and crisp gin and tonics until 4am.\" Somehow we think there will be just a few more options than that.

For those who are really in the know, there is a special secret buried in the article, but good luck finding it! Everyone knows that Paul Sevigny loathes press, so this may just get George banned from the place forever. But he doesn't care, saying \"if I'm banned, so be it\". That's the spirit! [via Gawker]

Sometimes things are too funny. For instance, we had a great time getting everyone pumped for El Bano, including our humorous little interview with their \"management\".

Here are two recent emails we received:Has El Bano opened!? Any word? What's the deal with El Bano!? I'm sure everyone wants to hear more, havent heard of anyone going. Plus anyone worthwhile will clearly be at The Eldridge! Fill us in please. So yes, what is the deal? When will the rest of the non-blogging world have a chance to get their key? Will there be real gold flakes in the cocktails? We sit on the edge of our seats, begging for more information. But only because our readers clamor for it, not because we really give a hoot.

Did you not get past the velvet ropes of the Eldridge to hang out with NBA announcer Kenny Smith and drink $26 cocktails with real gold flakes? That's too bad. But we've got news for you. You can just put yourself on the guest list via facebook. A LB tells us, \"i just got this facebook msg from scott, naeems bf \"hey guys! if you want to come tonight please add yourself to the guestlist on FACEBOOK. The Eldridge people do not know who you are and if you don't let me know, you will not be on the guestlist. thank you.\" Be advised - write your name in a short, choppy sentence so that you can make the guest list. If its not written in that format, the door people won't understand what you wrote, and you will not get in to mingle with celebrities like Kenny Smith, Camryn Mannheim and MTV’s Suchin Pak. What an action packed lineup! We wonder if any of them hooked up! Also, in case you are wondering Scott and Naeem love it there, saying \"The space is really beautiful and intimate. The cocktails are outrageously decadent and we plan on spending future evenings sampling the entire drinks menu.\" That's reason enough for us to stay away, but it may be just enough reason for us to move as well.

I am an acquaintance of Matt Levine's and Matt is, and always will be, a GIANT DOUCHE BAG! I even say this to his face. The Eldridge can't even begin to compare to the likes of Bungalow, Socialista, Beatrice or Rose Bar. Their doorman in his cheap too small suit is a giant goofball and their cocktail waitresses in those tacky little costumes are even more goofy and ridiculous. The Eldridge is a place where New Yorkers will go once just because of the buzz and most will never have a reason to go back. I went by the other night to pay my respects to the corpse which will soon be the decomposed body of The Eldridge.

We never though the AvroKo folks could get Double Crown, their new restaurant on the Bowery exploring the \"aesthetic and culinary dualities arising from the British Empire’s forays into India and Southeast Asia\", open by the weekend. After all, we had visual proof that the space was barely finished. Alas, we were wrong. A Little Birdy happened by the space this past weekend and the noticed that they were setting up for a private event, meaning that despite being closed, Double Crown was indeed open. Our LB says, \"inside looked big (extends way back), high ceilings, lots of wood, lots of big dining tables with a long bar immediately on the right when you enter. Looks like a restaurant, not a bar/lounge\" That's because the lounge will be in the basement and operate independently from the restaurant. We expect work to continue throughout the week with the public opening coming next week. Hold tight.Additional photos after the jump.

There is no better way to kick off fashion week than an intimate gathering of friends and glitterati several hundred feet above the ground. That's why we were thrilled to stop by the Mini Rooftop NYC event on the Far West Side to kick off New York's September extravaganza. The capacity was just 150, so we made sure to arrive early as not to be left out, and so did MK, Philip Crangi, Catherine Holstein, Jessica Stam, Ralph Mouth and Potsy. The main attraction, besides the superbly decorated rooftop, was a live set by MGMT (feeling no pain) and a DJ set by Diplo. The weather was perfect, the production was amazing, and the panoramic views of the city provided an amazing backdrop to the show. We drank, we smiled, we laughed, and we enjoyed ourselves immensely. Ahhhh. The Mini Rooftop will last all week, with V Magazine, Vice Magazine, Shipley Halmos and Vena Cava's joint after party, and Rag and Bone's after party all being held there. Good times fer sher, but too exclusive to have any Guests. You know? Thanks Mini, Radar, Dazed and Confused and everyone for the fun. More great photos after the jump!

Opening night of Fashion Week continues with the Interview Magazine party at the soon to be completed Highline location of Andre Balazs Standard Hotel. Still a fairly raw construction site, the party had a pretty rough feel, with the bartenders wearing hard hats, lots of trannies and a somewhat chaotic door. Up on the 18th floor, the views were stunning in all directions. Notable attendees included DVF, Tommy Hilfiger (who we shared an elevator with), Sean McPherson, Terry Richardson and Lydia Hearst-Shaw. Notable attendees getting no love at the door and forced to wait in line included Kristian Laliberte and Taavo Somer. Now, that's our kind of party.Click to see more pictures...

Its a fucking shame, there is some poor family out there that can't buy groceries as often as they like or make a mortgage payment but this assfuck is tossing $300 singles in the air so some dumb wannabe Carrie Bradshaw will blow him later in the evening.

That to us is an assault and battery.\" To us, it's called the point. We expect this to be settled at some point, and have to question Schnore's decision to call the papers about it.

The Hunt, New York's hottest weekly party, is on the move to the Anchor. And since its Fashion Week, they will be throwing out $40 bottles of champagne, which seems to be a wee bit dangerous. These two creepy dudes will be DJing, but don't let them scare you off. $40 champagne!

The NY Barfly stopped by the Eldridge last night and posted the first review. Result? They loved it, saying \"After a few deliberative cocktails – we came to a verdict. There is not that much to hate in The Eldridge, in fact – there is plenty to enjoy.\" That's nice. In other Eldridge related news, a Little Birdy writes:I went to high school with Matt Levine and over the past few weeks I have been receiving MASS text messages saying \"spread the word, the Eldridge is opening thurs night\" Isn't this place suppose to be exclusive? It sounds like he is making a desperate cry for business when the doors aren't even open yet. He is trying to tap all of his wealth friends to come down and buy his ace of spades. PS: Just woke up today and on my BBM there was a message from ML with a picture of the WALL of Spades. Is this place a joke?Unfortunately, its not a joke. But we do wonder how it can be open if its doorman/resident genius Naeem is cavorting on the West Coast? Is there trouble in paradise? We certainly hope not.

The emails are pouring in. G Spa lounge, the tiny spa cum lounge in the basement of the Gansevoort Hotel, is no more. On Saturday night, the Spa will host its final shindig and you are invited to give it its proper farewell. Well, maybe not you, but you can try. We were never a fan of the space because well, it was tiny and smelled like a spa. But still, it holds an important place in the history of the Meatpacking district, in that it proved that for a time, no matter what you opened there, people would come. People would come. Saynoara G Spa.

As luck would have it, we happened upon AvroKo's latest project in the former Manhatta space on the Bowery. Slated to open this month, Double Crown will feature 'British Colonial' food. The chef Brad Farmerie is from Public and brother of Andy, one of the Avro/Ko partners. There will be a separate lounge opening downstairs called Madam Geneva. From what we saw (and pictured), the space is lofty and full of gorgeous masonry work, with a large bar space on the southern side of the room. Andrea Strong's 9/16 opening prediction may be a bit lofty, but this puppy is close to being ready. Expect buzz to be revving high for this one through the remainder of the year, and if the food is right, Double Crown will grow to be a lower Bowery fixture along with the Bowery Hotel, Gemma, Whole Foods and McNally's new joint. On the Bowery. How weird is that?

Last week, DBTH had the opportunity to head to PDT for an intimate cocktail tasting with proprietor Jim Meehan to sample several cocktails featuring Gran Centenario tequila. While tequila was the main event, we also had the chance to pick Jim's brain about cocktails, PDT, and what ingredients have him really excited for the upcoming fall menu at PDT. One drink we tasted, the Fresa Verde, will be featured on said menu, and features Centenario Plata, fresh strawberries, green pepper, lime juice and pommegranate syrup. The drink had a full, earthy taste that really enhanced the agave flavor. Dynamite. And as for the fall menu ... Jim is predicting that apple cocktails will be all the rage. Don't think appletini either, especially when skilled craftsmen like Mr. Meehan are whipping up creations like the Gran Treacle, which includes tequila, NY state apple cider, agave syrup and Bittermens mole bitters. Outstanding. After several tequila cocktails, we were feeling pretty loose heading into the long weekend, but not so loose that we forgot to snap a few photos.

Remember Valentines Day in middle school, when kids walk around hoping to be special enough to be given a card or treat? Well, knowing that this is the week that the Eldridge sent out its \"Guest of Matt Levine\" cards to the 400 most special people on the planet (exclusing Tom Cruise), we can't feel more than just a little bummed. Why didn't we get one? Why did we only get a roll of two ply? Waa. Waa. Anyway, apparently there are scores of them going out to people. Pictured above are three cards sent to three Little Birdy's who lined them up and snapped a pretty picture. So pretty. A Little Birdy also told us that several people were getting multiple cards. Can they not find 400 recipients? We also were forwarded an email blast by Shecky's, who have been inside and state \"this is the best $650,000 wall of Armand de Brignac among the tenements of the Lower East Side.\" You know Shecky's, always willing to go out on a limb. We will be standing in line outside each and every night, begging to be let as a +1. Have pity on us.

I am sure EVERYONE who is going to the Eldridge will be soooooo interesting. You can ask them how it is (if you are unlucky to get in) cause they will be at rosebar, the box, beatrice, 1Oak or anywhere else there is buzz.

A Little Legal Birdy forwards news that a federal judge has dismissed a lawsuit brought by the Scores East alleging that New York City and the SLA used trumped up charges of prostitution as grounds to take away their liquor license. This is a major blow against the gentleman's club, which was once the biggest name in male entertainment, but has seen the bloom come off its rose over the past year. It's much heralded Scores West has closed down, many of it's franchises around the country have been sold, and Lonnie Hannover, who many credit with making Scores what it once was, has jumped shipped to rival Rick's Cabaret, bringing his high profile rolodex (and Ricky's Man) with him. There is still a lawsuit in state court that has yet to be heard, but things aren't looking good for the former king. Full excerpt from the judgment after the jump. A federal judge has dismissed a lawsuit brought by the stripper club Scores East alleging that New York City and the state Liquor Authority entered into an agreement to use \"pretextual\" charges of prostitution to take away the club's liquor license. In denying the bid of the \"gentlemen's club\" at 333 East 60th St. for a preliminary injunction, Southern District Judge Richard J. Sullivan said Scores has failed to show the state agency, the city or any other defendant acted in bad faith or intended to harass the club. The club claims the agencies are trying to chill its First Amendment right to \"expressive activity,\" but Judge Sullivan said it has not shown that a pending Liquor Authority proceeding would not adequately remedy any alleged constitutional violations. Moreover, he said \"the First Amendment does not bar the state from enforcing valid laws intended to regulate liquor licenses merely because the establishment that holds the license also engages in First Amendment activity.\" A state lawsuit challenging the licensing revocation is still pending. Scores East v. New York State Liquor Authority, 08 Civ. 4147, will be published Friday.

Last night at Gemma, Viridian Spirits, the country's premier absinthe producer and import company, hosted a rather intimate tasting and dinner party for some esteemed guests. We're not going to get into all of nitty gritty, but we will tell you there was a whole bunch of absinthe going around, and the company is quite pumped to be pumping the U.S. full of wormwoody goodness. The star of the evening was Claude Alain-Bugnon, a Swiss absinthe expert who is a pioneer of the clear absinthe method. Claude has teamed with Viridian to create Clandestine, a clear absinthe made from his original recipe, to the U.S. market. In addition, Viridian has also launched Nouvelle' Orleans, another high end label that was created through the magic of reverse engineering. Amazing. We sampled numerous cocktails, including the refreshing Vincent Van Gogh, made new friends, and learned a hell loadabout absinthe. Not bad for a Wednesday night. More pictures after the jump!

As we told you earlier, the former Opus 22 is poised to become Mr. West, a new lounge by nightlife veterans Danny Divine and DJ Jus Ske. Thankfully, they have dropped the gimmicks to bring us a straight up nightspot, with the press release claiming Mr. W is a \"relaxed, yet trendy, locale that will transition flawlessly from happy hour hotspot to high-energy lounge each night. \" Well that's nice. And for those who demand bottles, Mr. West will offer \"Personal mixologists will attend to the needs of bottle service clients.\" But will the drinks be served the way they were meant to be served? Apparently it is open this weekend for anyone who is in town. Opening soon!Full release after the jump. Over the years, New York City club-goers have been lured to the newest hotspots by gimmicks of all shapes and sizes. But this fall, New York nightlife will get a taste of something straight-forward with a venue whose décor and service speak for itself. Nightlife veterans Danny Divine and DJ Jus Ske have teamed up to create Mr. West, a relaxed, yet trendy, locale that will transition flawlessly from happy hour hotspot to high-energy lounge each night. With a staff whose attention is focused on personalized service rather than creative contrivances, bottle service will be invariably prompt, wait staff will be attuned to the customers’ needs, and bartenders will mix cocktails as they were meant to be crafted. The 1800 square foot space is a powerful blend of luxurious elegance perfectly matched with touches of modern simplicity. Upon entering, guests will view an extensive, granite bar adorned by a custom-built, six-hundred strand, crystal chandelier. As patrons continue into the main space of Mr. West, they will view a cluster of handmade, oversized lampshades dripping with LED-lit cascades of crystals hung above eighteen black velvet banquets wrapped around the dance floor. Adding depth to the room is a bronze mirrored wall running the length of the space, made three-dimensional by alligator cutout paneled overlay. Completing the overall refined look of the room will be a wall-sized photograph hung above the state-of-the-art DJ Booth; a gift from celebrity photographers, which will rotate seasonally. With companies including Commes des Garçons and Balenciaga already established, the West Chelsea area continues to transform into a hot, new business locale. Mr. West will cater to these young, trendsetting professionals looking for a place to relax and unwind after a long day with coworkers and friends. Personal mixologists will attend to the needs of bottle service clients while our talented and well-trained bartenders serve up cocktails including our basil grapefruit martini and cucumber cosmo, made with fresh pressed, organic juices and garnished with seasonal fruits. Mr. West will also offer guests a small plates menu, which will feature various tapas-style dining options.

I've seen several of those white-gold plated jeroboams opened at Mynt in Miami one night. They would stop the music and play the Star Wars theme music everytime they brought one out (with the sparkers and 4-5 waitresses). I had no idea they were 25k. That's a little absurd...

***CONTENT
Apparently, we are cool enough to get a bit of time with the management of El Bano. We would love to share our conversation with you:Is this for real? I assume you mean the name, which we get a chuckle out of as well. We think it's a great name considering how our club is set up. You must enter through a bathroom. I can't say any more about that though. Do you have any previous nightlife experience? Are you involved in any other venues? I've run many clubs through the years, some in new york and some in Europe. This was kind of a just for fun project a few business associates and I decided to put together. I will say that we are heavily bankrolled...I'm talking real money from real players in business and we play hard. Are you in Manhattan or Brooklyn? I've been to Brooklyn before, but honestly why would we open a club there? We're going for exclusivity, for the rich, the famous. None of which is in the outer boroughs. I will say we are downtown but I won't give the exact location just yet. What is the approximate capacity of this space? We have capacity for 150 people including a private VIP area that is modeled after a bathroom I once visited in Kyoto. We even shipped in the same tile they used. It's so luxurious, you have to see it to believe it. What will your hours be? Right now we're only booking private parties for our fabulous friends, though when we do the grand opening, we'll only be open Wednesday through Saturday nights from 11-4am. Do you have Fashion Week events booked? Yes, for the entire week. We are excited to get open after all of this time. We can't say who has parties booked but we're going to be filled to the brim with models which is always fun! What kind of music will you have? Only the best party music. We have a roster of rotating DJ's as well as acts we fly in from the UK and Paris. We love that Paris dance music right now.

come on its cleary a parody of apothecarie and the eldridge (and all the other \"speakeasy\" type places, but these two in particular). DBTH is making a valid point about how disturbing the quest for exclusivity is in contemporary NY nightlife. Why are we so concerned with hanging out with people who may not have been pre-screaned and deemed sufficiently l\"ike us\" in order to get a key? I'd like to hear DBTH write seriously on what he thinks about these trends. Should we just do away with keys, passwords and six figure salary bouncers and just have private clubs like in London? Call a spade a spade.

Our crack team of scientists has indeed cracked the first code of El Bano. So what is behind door #1? A key! We knew it! And the key comes with another clue, saying: El Bano is a secret club, and like all things secret it's only known by few.To gain access to the club you must first possess a key. You see, first you go into a lovely little bodega and enter the bathroom with your key. You will see a bouncer in the bathroom guarding a stall. You give him the nod and he'll open the door and a wall will slide open revealing the club. Getting a key is easy. If you're our friend you already have one. If you're famous or strikingly beautiful, you already have one. We make mistakes though, and may want to offer you a key. The plot thickens! Tomorrow, we will bring you a special interview with the secretive El Bano management, who will unveil some more details about their super secret hideaway lounge.

Being the diligent journalists that we are, we decided to email the reservations line at El Bano to try and get the low down on this secret bastion of exclusivity. The result? El Bano is even more exclusive than we could ever imagine! We got an immediate response back, saying:Thanks for your reservation inquiry. Due to the exclusivity of our club, it's impossible for us to accommodate all requests. If you feel you really belong, please E-Mail us back and let us know why.Well, how could we ever come up with a reason as to why we belong in the Toilet? We couldn't. But our scientists are still working on answering their brain teaser, and we will have a location shortly.

Can there possibly be a more exclusive club than the most exclusive of them all? Apparently, there can be. Brace yourselves for El Bano, a place so exclusive that it calls itself \"New Yorks Most Exclusive Nightlife Experience.\" Fascinating stuff. According to their dizzying website, El Bano comes complete with a Famous Mixologist and a Famous Chef, none of which you are allowed to know about. As per the location, you aren't allowed to know that either, with El Bano saying \"that if you’re supposed to know where we are, you know where we are.\" Douchey. But if you can solve their puzzle, you will find out where they are located. We have hired a crack team of scientists to work on this riddle immediately, and will provide an update soon. And just in case you cared, The Toilet will be open in time for Fashion Week.

Just 8 weeks after being closed for re-tooling, the former Cafe Socialista space at 505 West Street is ready to re-introduce itself to NYC. Stans, a new Thursday night event, is poised to take over the former Cuban cafe beneath the Jane Hotel, and the organizers believe they have a one of a kind location. How do we know? It's on the invitation, saying \"It is revered by experts in their field as a classic party location that just now has resurfaced.\" They promise $6 beers, dancing, and potential kissing - not too shabby. Most importantly, it seems to make the situation at the Jane Hotel a bit more interesting, considering the still going Socialista lounge and Eric Goode and Sean MacPherson's two planned spaces in their sailor friendly hotel.

The record player having, soon-to-open, super cool Ace Hotel seems to have everything put together. With a hip brand opening its first NYC locations, Rudy's barber shop, gourmet coffee, Ken Friedman backed restaurants, and guitars in the rooms, how could it possibly fail? Well, they still have to get rid of the SRO tenants, and it looks like things are getting a bit desperate. A Little Birdy reports that \"there are some tenants that have simply refused to take a buy out, and the people from the Ace have repeatedly raised the offer. It started out at $5,000 and has doubled several times. I have heard the remaining tenants are being offered around $100K just to get out!\" Do you hear that people? We suggest finding yourselves a room in one of the few Manhattan SRO's left and hunkering down until some fancy hotel developer \"discovers\" an opportunity.

The city is missing a big opportunity here - the city should be getting these payments not the tenants. The tenants got a cheap place to live, they shouldn't get the buyout as well. The city should have a plan that would allow any developer to pay $100,000 to deregulate an apartment. Then that $100,000 should be taken and used to build new affordable units elsewhere. Instead of old dilapidated units we would end up with much more and much better affordable housing stock. Sure the $100k/unit doesn't pay for a new unit in cash, but it definitely is enough cash to cover the equity piece needed for a new development of low income units.Then tenants didn't do anything to deserve this $100K it should belong to the entire populous not one individual.

Douglas, or should I say Douglass,What elitist planet are you from? One that thinks the act of displacing moderate income people from a thriving neighborhood is acceptable? Your arrogance and inconsideration for the reality of the average citizen is appalling.Working class people who have spent years paying their rent on time and occupying a residential unit in accordance with all of the stated terms and conditions of their lease should not be forced out of their units in any way, no less denied any substantial amount of compensation for relocating the very nucleus of their lives. The mentality expressed in your opinion piece lends credence to the theory that all of these people should be shipped to obscure housing projects far away from one of the most expensive zip codes in Manhattan, as to leave 10001 void of any real artistry, color, creativity, and diversity. You'd rather have empty suits occupying the entire area as the lowly average citizens mass transit in this direction to serve them. Yeah, OK, in your dreams pal.Now, I am the first person to decry the unethical practice of milking a corporation for money that one doesn't deserve, such as holding on to an apartment for the sole purpose of accruing income that one did not work for. That practice is wrong and harms both well-meaning tenants and landlords, such as the lease holders of 1886 Broadway, who strive to negotiate settlements in good faith. After all, the reality is that some tenants at 1186 Broadway are, indeed, being a bit too opportunistic about their circumstances.However, the majority of tenants are not taking advantage of anyone and simply wish to continue on with their lives while living in an affordable environment. You seem to be void of the notion that there are elderly and long term tenants who have occupied 1186 Broadway for decades, becoming staples in the neighborhood and active, contributing factors to the fabric of both the building and the surrounding area. Some were even born and raised in this building, and you suggest that they simply be discarded and sent up the river to who knows where?As a tenant in the building who has watched all sides of the action like an owl perched at the top of a tree, I can honestly say that the integrity of the landlord and the majority of the tenants has remained in tact and has passed the test which certifies good-faith and good-will. The landlord has made every effort possible to actually retain the present tenants in comfortable and generous conditions, offering each person without a bathroom an opportunity to take possession of a unit with a private bath. Additionally, the landlord has invited tenants to relocate to a bigger and better apartment on the premises, regardless of whether or not they currently have a bathroom, all while preserving the rent-stabilization status of each and every tenant. For this, the tenants are most grateful, and frankly, very, very fortunate.Since you do not equate long term residential status with any type of real equity, then perhaps, Douglass, you should pack your things like a true Nomad and keep relocating yourself at the rate of once a year, and send us all a postcard detailing your happiness and stability.Good luck to you and your viewpoints.

The website even notes that almost none of you will ever get in (or want to), saying \"It’s, unsurprisingly, a reservations only joint and, even then, chances are you’ll have to know somebody who knows somebody (who knows Levine) to even stand a chance of gaining entry.\" Something very strange about being so great that no one can go, but that's just us.

You may not have a choice. Rent: $4,000 per month Escalations: 2% per annum Size: 1,000 SF (Ground Floor), 500 SF (Basement) Term: 14 years Security Deposit: 3 Months Fixture Fee: $325,000 Comments: Full Liquor License C of O: 74 Persons $4,000 a month is relatively low, meaning the guy wasn't fooling about his sweetheart deal. Selling 125 Eldridge cocktails will cover the rent alone every month, and you know the elite of New York will be more than willing to do that. As for the $325,000 up front key money, well, having 2 superstar athletes and a glam god worthy clothing label can certainly cover that. If he doesn't sink too much up front money in the place, and can keep the City off his back for having dance parties without a cabaret license, well he may be able to pull it off. But that's the biggest MAY BE we have ever written.

The rent, and \"up front key money\" are nothing. This kid blew big $$$ on the build-out. Also, get real DBTH that little jackass doesn't make anything off his douchwear line. And I seriously doubt any superstar athlete put more than a $100 into his bar. Matt's adolescent wet-dream was bought and paid for by his dad.Matt Levine's money all comes from daddy. Daddy bought him the clothing line, daddy's money paid for his cocaine and armand de brignac, daddy bought him a party where he met some no-name NBA players he calls \"investors\", and daddy will bail him out when this disaster unfolds.Let's hope young Matt remembers to send both his daddy and his trust-fund manager laser cards. Thanks daddy!

Everyone is knocking this kid hard. I know him personally and he can be a Jackass but, he really isn't a bad kid. I think he is going to surprise some people. Fyi, even if the build out cost him $500K, which it didn't, that rent makes it a layup.

This past weekend, a DBTH family member checked out Sacha's latest spirits destination, the White Star, and filed this fun filled report:It was pretty uncrowded with an easy door. They literally only serve absinthe and beer and there are NO cocktails as I was sharply informed by the bartender. They also do the absinthe service with the sugar and water like at Hotel Delmano. the inside looks similar to milk and honey - narrow and dark and there's also a bigger room in the back. The crowd was banker and trendy les-siders (less hipster)...oh and the guy at the door was HILARIOUS with bright suspenders - he looks like something out of the monopoly era - they are really going all out with this whole 1920's thing. There is also no sign - just a white star light hanging in the entrance.Oh so kitschy. But with so many places to enjoy absinthe, is it worth all of the hassle? We would venture to say yes at least once. But if the rent is cheap, this place may just become the \"place to try absinthe\". How refreshing.

Uh. they only serve Absinthe and Beer, except for the ROWS of other spirits lining the back bar. Scotches. Whiskeys, Bourbons, all sorts of Amaros and digestives. Correct, there are no cocktails, but there are plenty of things to sip and savor. So just man up and have some rye the way god intended it.

After seeing our little tidbit on the future of Opus 22, a second Little Birdy follows up with the rest of the details. According to LB, \"the old opus is being opened by Evan fFrost, of 3 steps (19th & 2nd) and formerly of the short lived duke & duchess. heard it's going to be called 22s.\" If 3 Steps is any indication, we may be getting a West side version of an \"extraordinary cocktail lounge offers a much-needed reprieve from the ostentatious club scene. It's the cool, hip spot that the typical New Yorker-used to over-crowded nightclubs, pretentious party-goers and velvet-rope madness-has been craving.\" Sounds positively groovy. We guess. UPDATE: A Little Birdy tells a different tale, saying \"The new Opus space is NOT going be called '22's - it's going to be called Mr. West. Indeed, Evan is involved, but it's not his place - he is managing it. The space belongs to Danny Divine and DJ Jus-ske.\" Anyone have the final word?

A Little Birdy walked by the space that formerly housed Opus 22 and sensed a new beginning for the previously troubled location, saying \"Just walked by the old opus-22.....totally renovated and construction is ongoing...one of the workers said it was a new club opening in less than 2 weeks . . . Looked gorgeous!\" That location/space always was solid, but a trip down memory lane reminds us that Opus met its end when a bouncer opened fire on 4 customers for refusing to get up from their table. Let's hope the new venue brings happier memories this time around.

Courtesy of Daily NewsIt's litigation Friday at DBTH HQ. First the Bankruptcy Surprise of 2008, and now a LB forwarded us a story from today's Daily News announcing that former employees, including Asian waitress Cecilia Shim, were fired by 1OAK \" because the owner wanted sexy \"white girls\" serving his celebrity clientele\". That's no good. According to the suit, Shim was told \"owner Scott Sartiano only wanted \"white girls he could f---\" serving drinks.\" That's really no good. 1OAK reps vehemently deny this report, saying \"These disgruntled employees were fired for their poor work performance in addition to four other Caucasian employees that were fired that same week\".So where does John \"JE\" Engelbert fit in? Well, a commenter under the DN story using the name \" Engelheart323\" said \"The owner and manager are idiots. Sure they can hire all white girls but what makes the owner think that those white girls are going to want toFUCK him? Whatever, these people are stupid. I wouldn't want to work for such buffoons anyway.\" Gee, wonder who that could be. Then, we receive this super classy press release from JE himself, sayingNew York City club impresario John “JE” Englebert owner of Suzie Wong and Prime nightclubs in West Chelsea responds to the article and says “I don’t discriminate!! I feel sorry for those girls. Me and my staff always treat our employees with honor and respect. I would like to extend this opportunity for Cecilia Shim and the girls that were fired to come into my venues for an interview”That's so sweet of him, but what makes him think that working at Suzie Wong's is any peachier? Oh, because he is cookoo.

A Little Legal Eagle sent us a copy of the bankruptcy papers for Mansion and Pink Elephant, filed under managing partner Bruce Dunston. Most of the listed creditors are small time, liquor supply companies, payroll, IRS and DOF, attorneys etc. There are a few bold face names that are owed some serious scratch and unfortunately may wind up with 0.0. Let's go to the papers!Kelly Cutrone - People's Revolution owner, Hills star and friend of Steve Lewis is on the list of creditors holding 20 largest unsecured claims. She is owed $20,000 Callin Fortis - Nightclub designer to the stars is owed $400,000. Kenneth Barilich - A real blast from the past. The Crobar magnate and reported partner of Peter Gatien from back in the day is also owed $400,000 It's got to be rough to cross these unpaid bills off your expected revenue streams, but the chances of these creditors seeing any of this cash is slim to non. We feel for all of the parties involved, especially the little guys that provided an honest service and should have been paid.

Pink Elephant and Mansion have nothing to do with this. It's all from Bruce Dunston, who is the general partner of the LP that holds the lease to the building. The clubs that operate in the space have no rights as far as the building goes.They got a sweet deal since the liquor license and caberet license are for the BUILDING not the CLUBS, thats how they were able to bring new clubs into the space without dealing with the SLA

Pink Elephant (under Paradigm Management Group) and Mansion (under Mansion 530 LLC) have management and service agreements with Bruce Dunston's Partnership called 530 West 28th Street LLC. Typically under these arrangements, the management groups control promotions and operations and in return they get a cut of the sales and profits generated by the business owned by Bruce's Partnership. Looks to me that after the management took their cut of the sales and profits, there wasn't enough juice left over to sustain a viable business. Bruce's LP pays roughly 100K a month in rent for starters. According to the filing, they over 630K in back rent and real estate taxes. It will be interesting to see what happens next. This is a Chapter 11 reorganization, which means both Pink Elephant and Mansion can continue to operate until they figure out a viable game plan. If the business continues to deteriorate to the detriment of its creditors, the bankruptcy court will force the company into a Chapter 7 liquidation - Game over

Breaking news over the Birdy wire. Seriously Breaking News. Pink Elephant and Mansion have each filed for bankruptcy protection, claiming disputes with their landlord. According to the release:The petition, filed in Manhattan bankruptcy court yesterday, estimates $1 million to $10 million in both assets and liabilities. Bruce Dunston, senior manager of 530 West 28th Street LP, said in court documents that disputes over rent and property taxes led to the filing. Dunston also owned the nightclub Crobar, which closed last year.We don't believe that this will effect their operations as of tonight, but could jeopardize each space over the long haul. We have declared Mansion to be a shit show since day 1, but Pink Elephant's landlord troubles caught us off guard. Stay tuned.

They slipped by SLA rules and getting a caberet license by not being new \"owners\" just \"managers\"

The property will have 225 rooms, including 12 penthouses and 9 duplexes. Who doesn't need a two story hotel room, right? The residences will have priority reservations for the planned Nobu restaurant and have access to a Nobu yacht. You heard us. Nobu. Yacht. The Nobu group is counting on David Rockwell to lead the design, and the opening is planned for 2010. If you can't wait that long, you can head over to the flashy website, which is so much more fun than plain Jane Nobu New York one. Shalom.

Ever hear of the Ram's Head Inn in Shelter Island? Didn't think so. Despite its current anonymity, this stately estate and inn could be the next Surf Lodge and have Shelter Island's residents cursing Richie Notar and Andre Balazs for years to come if they wind up making a play. In his recent interview with Blackbook, Mr. Nobu let slip that he \"was looking at Ram’s Head in Shelter Island with Andre Balazs and at a place down the block. You want an oasis that’s achievable to go for a weekend.\" By a place down the block, we are guessing they looked at the not so stately Chequit Inn. This would be Andre's second Shelter Island property (Sunset Beach), but with the Montauk locals cursing the coming of the Surf Lodge, we aren't sure how kindly the Shelters would feel about a Nobu/AB tag team. We'll keep our ears to the ground to keep you in the loop.

Balaz looked at this last year too, and the year before that, they are asking mid-teens, too much.....not to mention Ram Island Residents won't stand for it, the Eklunds are attempting to lease to some slimer who wants to put a rehab in the inn and the whole isalnd (Ram & Shelter) are all up in arms...it's all over the papers.....if the town committee aren't going to allow a quiet rehab on serine Ram Island, there is no way in hell they will allow a balaz-like establishment...

DBTH recently got an early tour of the soon to open Atlantis at the Palm in Dubai. Wow. Really. No interior photos were allowed, but we were floored by what we saw. The Dubai version is similar to the original in the Bahamas, except it is 3 times the size, making it one large and in charge resort. While the rooms and outdoor amenities are going to be top notch, the area we want to focus on is at the top of the Palm, which will feature the nightlife and hospitality spaces. The Atlantis will be the home to the first Nobu in the Middle East and Sanctuary, a nightclub being developed by Raymond Visan. Raymond is an international nightlife kingpin and creator of everyone's Euro treat Buddha Bar. Fabolus! Workers are furiously working to get the Atlantis ready for a Fall 2008 opening. We suggest grabbing a business class seat on a new Emirates Airbus 380 if you want to really enjoy your stay.

An Evening At: The Fifth Floor at the Chelsea

***CONTENT
So we've covered the rooms. We've covered the pool. What about the Fifth Floor? As you all know, the Chelsea Hotel team locked up Paul Sevigny and Matt Abramcyk to bring their Beatrice cache out of New York and down to the beach. A bold and risky move for several reasons, but why look back? So what has the arrangement produced so far? We'll tell you. First, like everything else in the hotel, the spaces are retro and suave, with a throwback game room, lounge and pool side bar. Since the weather was so nice all weekend, the space that got the most play was the outdoor space. Friday night was relatively quiet, with some shore rats listening to the Beatrice DJ's spinning. Saturday night is when things got interesting. It all started Saturday afternoon when the party bus rolled in from New York City. That evening, the Chelsea was set to host Anna Abramcyck's (Matt's sister) birthday party, and to help her celebrate, the hotel bussed down heaps of her friends. After a late supper, we strolled into the Fifth Floor around midnight. We found the game room relatively empty, but the outdoor lounge was on and popping. MGMT was blaring over the speakers, and the bus folks were starting to make their way downstairs from the penthouse pre-game.Fast forward to 2:00 AM, when some of the LCD Soundsystem crew had taken over the tables, spinning a deep funk groove. The birthday party (and DBTH) had crossed the threshold into the game room and indoor bar and a dance party was in full effect. The pool deck cleared out, but the party was just getting started. By 3:30, it was seemingly anything goes, and almost anything did. We headed upstairs at about 4, but it seemed like we were the first. Such losers. If the Chelsea wanted to show that the NYC kiddies would be willing to trek down to the dirty dirty, this is certainly a good start. Those who were there certainly learned first hand that you can have fun in Atlantic City. But how did they enjoy the shore regulars that had to gawk at their VIP treatment? And will that turn the regulars off? We certainly shall see.

After a few days in Telluride CO to clean out the lungs and visit Matt Levine's boy Tom Cruise I am Back!! Ok so quick thoughts on The Chelsea are that the space is nice rooms pool lounge all great but what happens in the winter when the shuttle buses aren't bringing the hipsters? Who will support this place, steroids and skinny jeans don't mix and that is this place's fatal flaw it will be too cool for its demographic and in turn it will miss its mark with its core audience (Vacationers and South jersey/Philly residents). Its a shame but luckily they were hired as consultants and won't lose tons of $$ by being equity partners.

Yeah same thing happened when we where there. They brought everyone down in a bus, COMPED our rooms and drinks and about 25 of us were the life of the party (actually we were probably the only ones there). And this is a Saturday in August with nothing else to do. It was a cute time but I dont think anyone is going to hop on a bus in October, especially if it's a not a free ride the whole way. Ghost Town after Labor Day.

So we've covered the rooms (and the sign). It's time now to move outdoors for some daytime recreational activity at the Chelsea Hotel. Weather wise, we couldn't have asked for a better weekend. The sun was out all weekend with nary a cloud to be seen. At around 12:00 on Saturday, we headed down to the pool to check out the scene. The actually pool is rather small, but for reason there are 2 lifeguards on duty. Safety first. There are approximately 50 lounge chairs spaced around the perimeter with seven cabanas lining the edge of the roof. This was the first weekend that the pool was serving food, so we settled in for a day of cocktails, music and sun, and mixed it all together with some delicious food. It didn't reach Roosevelt standards (or anything close to it), but the Chelsea pool was most certainly fun. There were several Eastern European waitresses buzzing around, attentive to your every need. Our favorite part was the $40 pitcher of cocktails we ordered up around 4:00. We selected some sort of vodka and rosemary infused lemonade which was both large and refreshing. Did we mention it was large? We're talking 8 or 9 solid glasses. Look out. By 4:00, the sun had moved to the other side of the building, covering the roof deck with shade. We decided to make our way down to the famous Atlantic City beach to soak up a few more hours of sun. Good move. Good move. The Chelsea has a dedicated team of attendants surf side who are there to provide you with chairs, towels and an umbrella. Cabanas are also available to rent if you so desire. We did not. Sadly, there was no more lemonade available. Tear. The beach was our chosen local on Sunday as well, and the common sentiment we heard was how great the Atlantic City beach was. The fickle New Yorkers who had made there way down for the weekend festivities (more later) were all smiles, enjoying the surf, sun and sand that is just steps away from the Chelsea. We agree completely. We really do agree.

Stepping into the Chelsea Hotel in Atlantic City is a bit like stepping into the set of Mad Men. The developers and architects did a tremendous job reaching back into the resort town's past to connect it with what they hope is the future. So while the hallways have brown patterned wall paper and striped carpets, the rooms display a simplistic elegance with some design flourishes accentuating the hotel's throwback theme with modern touches that today's traveler demands. What does that all mean? Well, the plush king size bed sits beneath a black, Formica-esque headboard and there is a leopard print chair and ottoman in the corner, all facing a 37\" LCD. The lamps, dressers and curtains all contribute to the motif, bringing guests back to the classic hotel days of yesteryear. The topper is the mini-bar, complete with an assortment of Atlantic City goodies and retro candy that make sure you know that \"old is new\". The prices were reasonable, but we weren't in the Blackjack gum mood. Maybe next time. Each room also comes equipped with a Kiki de Monterparnasse Travel Intimacy Kit, just in case things on the 5th Floor get a little too wild. While the room was very nice, there were still a few kinks to work out. The elevator service was spotty, the shower lacked a soap dish, and the air conditioner was rather noisy, the last two a throwback to the hotel's most recent turn as a Howard Johnson. Management assured us that improvements to the elevator system and HVAC are in the works, so we give them a pass. Overall, you have to hand it to the entire Chelsea design team. While the Borgata wanted to bring modern Vegas to the East Coast, the Chelsea is trying to establish an Atlantic City identity born out of its historic hey day. In terms of design, they pulled it off.

I was there this wknd as well. Sorry didn’t see you DBTH. Really liked the place and thought the concept is very well executed. Nice rooms, good service, good drinks (I recommend the ‘suffering bastard’) and the food at the restaurant was surprisingly good. The bar / pool scene was more seaside heights than bea inn perhaps, but they do the best with what they’ve got I suppose.

The comparision really isn't fair; people take off August in Europe, and thus european hotspots tend to be going on every night of the of the week in high season, building up to a round-the-clock frenzy in places like Ibiza. By comparison the hamptons scene is essentially busy only one night of the week, and not even all night long, with a \"Big\" holiday weekend where they are busy two nights of the week. It's pretty sad actually -- New Yorkers have to fret about getting to the few decent things there are to do on the few good nights there are, and immediately shuffle right on back to work the next day. People in Ibiza right now are partying so hard they're not sure what planet they are on, let alone worrying about how to get back to their jobs on earth .

In a recent sitdown with Blackbook, man about town Sebastian Nicolas (Upstairs at Cirprianis, The Box) drops a dime on his latest space. Dubbed House Party, Nicolas describes it as \"part art gallery, part performance space, part party space.\" Is that it? Luckily, we have some additional knowledge. This single floor space adjacent to Bond Street Sushi has quietly been hosting events. According to our on the scene Litte Birdy, the place was nothing to write home about. Our LB says \"it was just a poorly decorated apartment, it looked like a college apartment that people were moving out of. I have been there a few times, once for some party for the cast of Gossip Girl. The whole night was people giving each other awkward looks.\" Mmmmm, sounds like a hoot! But Msr. Nicolas has certainly proven himself as a generator of the fun. We are looking forward to seeing what exactly he has planned going forward.

You bozos go to house parties in ugly apartments and hang out at overrated clubs while I'm going to be at a yacht party in lake michigan this weekend in upper 70's degree weather and little humidity. I feel sorry for all you NYC people.

Chicago Rules, on a scale of one to ten, how much enjoyment do you derive from reading this blog every day to talk about how not cool New York is (whilst making sure to pump Chicago's \"yacht part[ies]\"). Are you some sort of Chicago travel agent cum blogger? Nothing against Chicago, it is nice and quaint. I just cannot think of any New Yorkers who go and read all the Chicago nightlife blogs on a regular basis.On the topic of the original post, apartment parties are great - I don't understand why this wouldn't be fun?
yea

i was in chicago for Lolla. I had a great time, weather was sick. but the clubs in Chi have no character or design and could be any place. They're thrown together, bottle service spots. crowd is eh, didnt see too many head turners and i was surprised about that being lolla that wkend.

Chicago summers are so much better than NYC; it's no comparison. and yes, grant/millennium park are better than central park. sorry, the truth hurts. regarding clubs, you must have gone to the wrong ones. the elite chicago clubs/lounges are tougher to get into than the NYC venues and have hotter women.

This has been a valuable lesson for me and I have learned how easily comments can lose context. I have a tremendous amount of respect for these leaders in nightlife. I hope to make amends wherever and however necessary. Furthermore, these are my own words and thoughts, not those of The EMM Group or Tenjune owners, Eugene Remm and Mark Birnbaum, in any way, shape or form.” Aalexander JulianHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA.

Our friends at Hotel Chatter are the first to get inside the Ace Hotel and there is oh so much to report. Let's get right to it:The room has a very residential feel which includes full size SMEG refrigerators (think That 70's Show) stocked with goods from local NYC names like Brooklyn Brewery. The best part of the minibar is that it is not so mini. The fridge I saw had a complete six pack of beer from Brooklyn Brewery. The room was also equipped with a turntable and acoustic guitar (strange but cool.) From what I saw room types will include everything from smaller bunk bed rooms up to 2 bedroom suites. I toured a suite still in demo phase and it was very large. I think this hotel will offer a great option for people looking to stay in a hip hotel in a fantastic central location in NYC at all price points.But will there be records? And how much does each bottle of Brooklyn cost? We're guessing yes and $6. According to HC, the hotel is gunning for a Winter 08/09 opening, just in time for the first Holiday travel season of the current recession. This could be a real bargain stay for those who already booked their flight. We can't wait.

Could the good times soon be over at the Beatrice Inn. The West Village spot and DBTH fave needs to renew their liquor license, and the community seems to be overwhelmingly opposed. Shock. Thanks to Eater, we learn that \"even Amy Sedaris came out to express her opposition, though she didn't voice her opinion to the board. Other, more vocal, residents complained about everything from the noise of the club goers to issues with idling taxis to problems with drugs, smoking indoors, and fire hazards.\" The final vote is tomorrow, so if you are a community board resident and fan of the Bea, go and lend your support.

Matt Abramcyk was being prosecuted at both Beatrice Inn and Smith and Mills for fraudulent licenses. In his case not only is he not licensed to be a bar in either location. He is stupid enough to steal, rob, and commit fraud on his neighbors and tell outrageous stories on them. This is what happens when you get into a \"Legal Bar Brawl\". You bring attention to yourself with the authorities. I suppose he is lucky he is not being prosecuted for income tax evasion too. This kid is seriosly screwed up. He foolishly went after his neighbors in both places when he knew the licenses were fraud. Neither license will ever be renewed.

Photo courtesy of BlackbookBlackbook's scores an interview with Tenjune's Aalex Julian, and it is amazing. This dude is 100% real and dishes straight. Because we love you, here are the highlights:On Jon B: \"Jon B is the K-Mart of nightlife\" On turning pretty girls away: \"If I turn away a beautiful girl one night, there are gonna be two more the next night that are younger and prettier. We’re probably the only city in the world that has that.\" Why Tenjune rules 1OAK: \"In almost two years at Tenjune, we haven’t had a single fight. If you look at the money that we’ve made and the money that 1Oak has made ... in fewer risks that they’ve taken because they’re so selective, well, they wanted to be so selective, they’ve had more problems than we’ve had in two years. Highly informative and oh so scandalous. He is like Matt Levine x1000. Or maybe Matt Levine is just Aalex Julian lite. Or what have you? [Blackbook]

Sometimes the best advice really does come from complete strangers. While waiting in line at a pharmacy, we overheard two ladies discussing the wide variety of breath mints and gum available at the register. Things turned minty when they came across the Listerine strips:Lady #1: Now see, I don't mess with those. Lady #2: No? Lady #1: Nah. See, if you go to the club and have some drinks, and then drive home and get pulled over by the cops - see if they give you a breathilizer, it'll come back hot. Lady #2: For real? Lady #1: Those things will make the test come back hot. I don't ever take those. There you have it. We never condone drinking and driving. Ever. But if you don't want to erroneously fail a breathilizer test, stay away from Listerine strips. Who said that DBTH wasn't informational?

2008-10-31 02:27:00
My name is Karen Tobin and i would like to show you my personal experience with Klonopin.I am 37 years old. Have been on Klonopin for at least 4 months now. I have been taking Klonopin twice per day (once in the AM and once in the PM). My prescription is for .5 mg and I take one pill or 1 1/2 pills depending on whether or not I need it. Perhaps I just have an extremely non-addictive personality, but this drug has been in no way addictive. I feel better than ever, as my crippling anxiety has disappeared and I sleep very well. I do not get a \"high\" from the pill nor do I ever experience problems. I drive daily and experienced no dizziness or ill effects. This was the only drug that worked for me after several others failed. Please give it a try before discounting it altogether.I have experienced some of these side effects-None, a little sleepiness, but nothing ground breakingI hope this information will be useful to others,Karen Tobin

Interesting little story that down and out Wall St firms are forcing their high priced talent to various global outposts to cut costs and hopefully tap into their booming economies. Sounds like a plan to us, but what does that mean for our fair city? Well, our Governor and Mayor continually bemoan rising deficits, but what of our nightclub owners, who depend on our fair minded financiers to fatten their bottom lines? Can they survive when the number of first year analysts making $80K never start work and the senior associates and low level directors are shipped overseas? It's not like the City will be without the rest of the high paid lovers of the night, so we don't see catastrophe on the horizon. But we are all in this mess together. Digg. [NY Times]

This, actually, is NOT good riddance. The coke-snorting, Gordon Gecko wannabe douchebags that you hate so much are actually what fuel our nightlife industry in NYC. They may not be the coolest people in the club, but they absolutely are the reason it is here. Like it or not, your beloved Beatrice Inn, your Box, and your Gold Bar would no longer exist were it not for these armani-suited MBA's throwing down big $$$ on table service, and $25 cocktails for their buddies and veuve clicquot - addicted model girlfriends.As anyone in the industry knows, the key to a successful nightclub is having a door that carefully balances the wall street guys, the celebrities, and the artist/freaks. Without one of these, the equation simply doesn't balance.

Great article! While other cities like Chicago have diversified into other business areas, NYC continues to be a one-trick finance pony. Now, it's paying the price and is getting crushed. By 2012 or so, NYC will be a crime-ridden city overrun by poor people and thugs, as all the good jobs will go to other parts of the country and international hubs like London, Dubai, Hong Kong, and Tokyo.

No other employers but i-banks and hedge funds give redbull-fueled alpha males million dollar bonuses to blow on weekends in the city.

You guys are missing my point. Something magical happens when we have a perfect mix of artists and freaks and celebrities and big money wall street types. Without one of those, a nightlife culture doesn't maximize. I'm just saying that even the wall street guys have a place in this world.

Oh yeah it's Toooos Day, Oh yeah it's Quick Hits! Oh yeah it's Tooos Day, Oh yeah it's Quick Hits! Quick Hits.A Little Birdy reports from Nolita \"They are shooting a movie or tv show inside Goldbar - lots of trucks and help wandering around. Looks like a semi serious production. The Little Italy Euro tourists are loving that shit though.\" Could principal photography have already started for the Doorman 2. Probably not. The Beatrice Inn officially hit the Chelsea in Atlantic City this weekend. That's bad news for tourists, because according to an email we got \"The standard Beatrice Inn policies are in place, so look your best, make a call to the right people, etc\" That's too bad for the many Philly and Jersey folks that are the Atlantic City mainstays, but watching tons of shore rats get turned away could be a fun activity.

Photo courtesy of Daniel Maurer/NY MagA Little Birdy stopped the recently reopened Spiegelworld and files a glowing report, saying:Went this weekend, had not been prior, thought it was a good change of pace. Good beer on tap, the show is an amalgamation between Circ de Soleil and something you’d see at the Box – the crowd was eclectic. A worthwhile stop early in the evening, and really the best thing going that far downtown. I had no idea such a thing even existed – nor did any of the people with whom I went.We feel sad for your then, as Spiegel has been a high quality summer spot for several summers running. It's a true urban wonder, tucking a quality and temporary bar and lounge on the backside of the awful (but up and coming!) South Street Seaport. And they have a pretty big food selection too! We suggest you all make a go of it before time runs out.

As always, below is an actual comment from an actual reader. Yes, we have them. From today's gripping Dear DBTH post, If I really wanted to I could get in with some fashion PR girls I know to get me in or a dude that I am kinda cool with who is close with Matt the DJ. Its not impossible but the fact that it even takes that kind of energy is annoying. I would much rather say the magic word and walk in. A word that i thought DBTH would know. But to be honest is there really any club in NYC that is IMPOSSIBLE to get into I mean other than \"The Eldridge\" of course. [Willy Be G]You know anything that mentions the Eldridge shoots right to the top. You have to.

It's hilarious every time I read about these NYC people who try so desperately to get into a dirty club like beatrice inn. NYC nightlife is so overrated that it's not even funny. You guys should come check out Chicago if you want to experience fun nightlife in a clean venue with women who are actually hot. We all know that NYC women are ugly as sin.

This is really pretty sad. Why not go somewhere you and your friends won't have trouble? There are so many great bars and restaurants and clubs to hang out in in NYC, and life is too short to wait in lines or subject yourself to humiliation. Going out drinking with friends should be fun. Besides, Beatrice Inn really isn't that cool anyways. Come fashion week, the drunken celebutards, and the star fuckers who clamber at the feet will have moved on to the next \"hot spot\" and the beatrice will just go back to being a smelly, rat-infested west village basement. - yawnLet's get some recommendations for cool, under-the-radar dancespots for willie instead.

Try Lit in the E Village. Great looking crowd (though young this time of the year - it's intern season!), good DJs playing unique mix of music. *Semi-secret* basement dance space, bathrooms are conducive to, um, wipe your nose. And yes, there are some cool famous people to gawk at while you get lit, but most people just don't give a shit, and are too fucked up anyways - and that's exactly the way it should be.

View from the DJ BoothBeijing is obviously a big city, so there is certainly a lot to do when the sun goes down. Today, we bring you just a bit more. When you hear Suzie Wong, you unfortunately think of a sub par sake lounge on Manhattan's West side. When we hear hear Suzie Wong, we think of a great bar and dancespot featuring the best sound system in Beijing. The place is seriously bumpin. Consistently one of Beijing's best dance clubs, Suzie's is also a space that creates a great mix of expats and local Chinese, a rare occurrence in a city where the scenes are usually separated. As you are well aware, the space is so popular that is has spawned imitations in Amsterdam as well as NYC.And in case nothing we've said tickles your fancy, may we also suggest the following. Block 8, owned by a French guy has more of a South Beach or St Tropez vibe and has a rooftop beach- complete with sand. What else did you expect? Then there is the Beijing institution China Doll, which features an almost total Chinese crowd but is worth at least one visit. Last but not certainly not least is Maggie's, which is 100% expat (mostly German) and is known for two things: The Chinese hostesses (a la Tokyo) and the Mongolian prostitutes. Come on, you know you want it. Previous: Postcard From Beijing

Let's go to the breakdown.The JaneChoice of room with either single bed or queen/king size depending on your budget Communal bathrooms Free internet TV/DVD en suite Air conditioning Multi-lingual staff Random full time residents mingling with guests Except for the smll flat screen in every room, this place is similar to every hostel we have ever stayed in. All it's missing is the dorm style rooms that NY Loft Hostel offers in its former factory space. After only 2 days, we are ready to delcare a new champion, The Jane really is the Coolest Hostel On Earth. Huzzah!

The US may already be an Olympic loser, but we strive to keep our readers completely informed on how not to be. If you can't find a way into the China Club, may we recommend you make your way to the oh so gorgeous Lan Club, a 25,000 square foot, $20 million Philippe Starck-designed pleasure palace featuring restaurant, nightclub and private banquet facilities. Not only is the Szechuan cuisine food outstanding, Satrck's over the top design makes this a truly one of a kind Beijing experience. Sorry Scott and Richie. The club is owned by the same woman, Zhang Lan, who founded the South Beauty restaurant empire, and word from our Little Beijing Birdys is that she has signed a lease in the Times Sqaure area to bring Lan Club or South Beauty stateside. That's an Olympic event we can root for.

It's a beautiful space but, actually, the food is a HUGE letdown. I ate there last month and though it's priced and presented to knock your socks off, the execution and the flavors are piss-poor. Try Da Dong for some great Beijing food (albeit Peking Duck). Or better yet, just go to Shanghai - which is WAY more fun on all accounts.

Time for another round of Dear DBTH. Today, a reader asks:Help! I just moved from New York into Boston... and was curious if you knew of any blogs that covered the nightlife scene in Boston? or if you could direct me to any venues reminiscent of home.Well, we don't know much about Boston, but maybe your fellow readers can lend a hand?

ugh don't go to Boston. Each bar is like a glorified frat party which is why I am always shocked and angered when going to pay for drinks. I moved from nyc to springfield, ma (like an hour and change west...or is it east of boston) blah! my suggestion would be taking the rather inexpensive Chinese bus and party in the city whenever you can =)

Aria is still open but pretty ghetto on most nights. Try: The Good Life, Suite, Rumor, Revolution Rock Bar, Sanctuary, Underbar. Still not NY though....not even close...

most of these posts are alright but stay away from Aria unless you wanna get shot. 33 is was once good but is pretty bad now. If you like Lounges and clubs stick to Middlesex Lounge, Gypsy bar, Revolution Rock, Underbar, Saint, Foundation Lounge and Sanctuary. Rumor is good but only on Tues. S.

Boston is actually a grat place if you are directed in the right direction. I would suggest checking out Mantra on Saturdays if you want a club that has a good looking crowd and great atmosphere. Also a great place for just some drinks and really good food is Cafeteria Boston on Newbury St. they also have a good crowd on a regular basis and the atmosphere is very cool & has a nyc/miami feel. Gisele is there all the time when she is in town and a bunch of celebs go there to dine.

Ok...Mantra on saturdays is strictly a college party. All girls 18 and over and little chain-wearing long island type boys. Cafeteria on Newbury is probably the worst restaurant in that entire area (and coincidentally owned by the two guys who promote Mantra saturday). I think most people reading this blog are trying to avoid that sort of crowd at all costs...

2008-08-07 16:40:00
Mantra is alright but not one of the better spots. I say Middlesex, Gypsy and Revolutiion you wont' go wrong. The beehive is a good chill spot also if you like jazz.

Just a week after Joshua David Stein tore into the teetering Cipriani empire, the Post's Steve Cuozzo comes out in defense of the tax evading Italians, claiming their overpriced celebrity fueled haunts so important to New York City and it's slowing economy that the SLA should not strip them of their liquor licenses. The Cuozz argues \"In fact, all of Cipriani's venues might take years to find new users. In a time of sinking morale driven by widespread economic fear, the city does not need its landmarked banquet halls forced to stand empty.\" Indeed that may be true, but perhaps some of the City's young hospitality Turks are waiting in the wings, looking for an opportunity to put their own stamp on these venues. We will know more in a few weeks, after the SLA holds their hearing. Stay tuned. [NYP]

A remote corner in the heart of Chinatown may soon be known for cocktails with a new lounge Apotheke, Inspired by the histoical apothecary and the artistic influence of absinthe dens in 19th century Paris. How high falluting! Apotheke is prepping for a late summer/early fall open at 9 Doyers Street, a space that itself was once an opium den. Behind the bar and cocktail menu is acclaimed \"cocktail chef\" Albert Trummer, who has previously worked for Bouley, Kittichai and Thom's Bar. Trummer has partnered with Heather and Chris Tierny, who opened the Burger Shoppe in the Fidi earlier this year.If you recall, we saw Albert Trummer put on a cocktail show at Norwood earlier this year, and the guy is good. Apparently, Apothéke will feature over 500 house cocktails, and carry over 1000 bottles of liquor from around the world, along with a selection of specialty house elixirs and infusions. The cocktail list will be divided into sections of the apothecary, including categories such as Pain Relief, Stress Relief, Health and Beauty, and Aphrodisiacs, and also boasts the most authentic Absinthe this City has seen in a while, culled from Trummer's personal recipe. All in all, Apotheke is an extremely ambitious and serious project dedicated to the cocktail, and obviously we are on board. Tierny and her crew have been promoting the space to event planners as ready for Fashion Week, so you may actually get to gander insider if you are cool enough to be involved with Fashion Week.

if you serve the \"opium\" cocktail, there will be massive protests by the community. it's wrong, and not clever at all. this isn't the early 1900s... there are no more chinamen in chinatown lying in the basement smoking opium for white tourists to gawk at, besides those scenes were staged by tour promoters to give gullible tourists what they want to see.

A very special Little Birdy drops a story about a distressingly negative experience at Blue Ribbon over the weekend. We wanted to share it with you.My friends and I went to Blue Ribbon Bakery around midnight Friday for some dessert and drinks. We got a few orders of bread pudding and several glasses of Muscat. After having the drinks for a few minutes, a friend noticed my glass was severely cracked. We grabbed the waiter to alert him of the issue, and he offered to either replace it or take it off the bill. But he also let us know that the glass was not broken when he served it, meaning I obviously decided to break it for fun. I was there to drink and eat, not cause damage. The glass was broken, please replace it so I don't leave with a bloody mouth!We feel your pain. Nothing aggravates us more than hospitality staff that would rather defend themselves than cater to their guests wishes. It's a glass, not a work of art, why not just offer to replace it and make us/them happy?

Perhaps the server just wanted you to know that he wouldn't have purposely served you a broken glass? Also I'm guessing you informed the server of the crack in an accusatory manner.

Our good friends at ACL came up with this handy dandy guide to navigating the Sunday Pool Party at McCarren Park. Our personal fave: DON'T wear denim. No matter how high you cuff yours. There’s no shade in the Pool, after an hour that denim might as well be grafted to your skin. Opt for a tailored khaki or navy short, hitting just above the knee, with slim pockets. Think the opposite of camo cargo shorts.Cheeky bastards. Click through to get a low down on the rest.

Sorry Village Inn - any cachet you had from being a new East Village hostel has been sucked away by New York Loft Hostel, a brand spanking new hostel in a former factory on the border of East Williamsburg and Bushwick. The place is big, clean, cheap, and of course in Brooklyn, making it oh so much cooler than a renovated tenement that still has a vacate sign on the door. The response has been great, with one twenty something guest saying \"I wish they had a liquor license. I'd love a bar. You see all the cool kids hanging around the neighborhood. It makes sense.\" It sure does. [DN]

As we prepare for our television sets to be overrun by Olympic programming for the next few weeks, DBTH is pleased to bring you a Postcard From Beijing, documenting the capital city's finest late night offerings.The saying goes that \"all road lead through Beijing\", and today that is truer than ever. Shanghai may be China's center of commerce, but Beijing is both the capital and the center of Chinese pride. For years, Beijing trailed behind Shanghai in the landscape of Chinese nightlife, but the recent economic boom has allowed Beijing to undertake a massive beautification campaign, and there has been a ton of movement in the hospitality sector. New hotels and restaurants are everywhere, and slowly but surely the nightlife is improving. Beijing has two main club types - Chinese and Expat. Chinese clubs have dizzying lighting systems and pound your ears with techno. VIP areas are always kept separate for natives. The drink of choice is bottles of Chivas scotch and pitchers of green tea. Men will shoot dice as a drinking game, while their dates seem to sit around behind them looking bored. Expat clubs are just that, complete with an international scene similar to what we have here or throughout Europe.For those in the know, a must visit is designer David Tang's Beijing outpost of the China Club empire located in a centuries old hutong. The space is designed in classic Chinese imperial fashion, complete with a stunning bar and multiple dining rooms. There are only 8 guest rooms available for China Club members, but since membership is extremely selective and expensive we guess that no one will be able to join before the games are over. However, members can make dinner reservations for guests, so we suggest you find one in order to allow yourself to partake in some of the finest things Beijing's nightlife sector has to offer.

Our weekend by the pool was interrupted by multiple Little Birdy's reporting that Marquee was shut down once again over the weekend! Let's go directly to the reports:LB #1: Rolled up at Marquee last night to find it deserted with only one bouncer and no line... Bouncer said they were closed for maintenance. Told use to go to Guest House?! Bouncer at Bungalow said they lost their liquor license.LB #2: marquee is closed as of friday- something to do with the SLA trying to yank their liquor license. This is a result of those drug sales charges against marquee employees. This may be extremely serious; i heard from a few sources that this may be the end of marquee. in any event, last night the staff set up the front of the club and were telling patrons that they were closed for maitenance issues (this would be the 3rd time in a month that they were closed on a thurs fri and/or sat for such issues).Indeed, it was just over one month ago that the SLA and NYPD taped Closed signs to the luxurious doors of Chelsea's most durable night club. The space raucously re-opened days later, but it may have only been temporary. We have requested comments from Marquee's reps, and hope that the rumors of its demise are entirely premature. DBTH has learned that they have booked several big events for fashion week, so it may not be time to call the grave digger just yet.Stay tuned to DBTH for additional info.

Courtesy of NY Times/Beatrice de GeaThis weekend saw an interesting pair of cocktail articles inspired by two classic liquors. Jonathan Miles of the Times dives into the varieties of Champagne cocktails popping up throughout Brooklyn, including newcomer James' play on the classic Black Velvet, a 50-50 mix of Champagne and beer. Created in 1861 to honor the passing of Prince Albert, James swaps the traditional stout for Leffe Brune to create a \"flavor evoking the scorched top of a crème brûlée\". Delicioso. [NY Times] Courtesy of WSJ/Dylan CrossOver at the WSJ, Eric Felten examines the history of Planter's Punch, which dates back to the mid 19th century. The rum drink born from the West Indies has been bastardize over the years with a variety of premade juices and mixes, but the classic recipe was once regaled as the drink of English society. Fascinating and marvelous stuff. [WSJ]

It's been a while since we checked in with the Box, Simon Hammerstein's nightclub/vaudeville/performance space in the Lower East Side. When last we checked, faithful DBTHers had voted the club to be past its prime. We have heard little to nothing about it since then. Until now. A Little Birdy who is very much in the know tells us he was dragged to the Box recently to meet some friends. While sitting at their stage front table with his lady, he ws treated to a performance of a woman, um, queefing into a microphone attempting to pull off some sort of musical accomplishment. Our LB told us it was the lamest, most disgusting stunt he had seen at a NYC club, something he could expect in Bangkok but not at a so called performance space in NYC that is supposed to be all about the art.

was there recently on a Wed night. saw the performance your birdie discussed. wasn't so bad - your birdie must not like the place. upstairs saw moby with a group and the actor from 70s show - topher whatever. lots of model types dancing between sets. why hate on a place trying to be different?

I was there last night. The crowd was pretty boring. The thing that really struck me was that the performances seemed to be toned way down!! I guess the memo went out that just being as gross as possible is not hot, nor edgy.

Lower East Side, Manhattan: In an effort to compete with the soon-to-open Eldridge, the Box announces that the tranny midget will be spraying the crowd with rosé Armand de Brignac, from his asshole!Local nightclub goers, and celebutards proclaim that the Box has jumped back over the shark (to the cool side that is).

i like the box, but i agree with sunshine that just getting gross is no longer edgy. and, in the interest of staying edgy, perhaps not as much b&t trash- the kind that likes to gt their picture taken with the doormen. it is bacoming a little trashy.

I was there a little while ago and had a great time. Staff (sans door guy) were awesome and super friendly shows consisted of a woman cutting herself and a tranny whose balls and weewee were hanging out. Not exactly my cup O tea but still def not like any other spot in NYC the space itself is goregous and the vibe is still edgy. I saw two different sets of I bankers with bottles galore but the rest was Artsy hipster crowd. I mean someone has to pay the rent for the space. I would def go again soon but its a night that you have to be prepared for and also not have work the next day cause you may be staying up all night!

With every oassing day, we start to love the Eldridge just a little bit more. Why? We don't know for sure, but it is probably related to the press-shy owner Matt Levine. Somehow, Paper Mag managed to drag him out of his shell to discuss the venture and Matt shed a bit more light on what his plans are for the his super-exclusive space opening in the Lower East Side. Some highlights:On choosing a bookstore for a front: \"It takes a story with many pages, and many elements to create a book. The Eldridge is not just one person, it's myself, it's our general manager, our bar manager, our door person, and the rest of our staff. Together, we make a story.\" On offering their guests take out menus: \"I am not sure what bars you are bringing food into, but let me know and I am there! We aren't a bar; if you had to sum up our concept, I'd say it's a speakeasy lounge. Our concept is creating a concierge-like atmosphere for our guests. If our guests want food, we want to cater to them. Looking around NYC, we currently don't see any other lounges offering this service.\" On New York's response to The Eldridge: \"We honestly have not read the comments, but since the nymag article we have an inbox of reservations, messages from readers asking to become members, and overwhelming inquiries about private events. The response from the magazine has been extremely positive.\" It's amazing to offer a service that every dive bar in the City offers and claim to be a pioneer. Maybe they should read the comments to see that the response hasn't been extremely positive. It all makes us giddy. Photo courtesy of Curbed

This guy Matt Levine is a fugly scrub who has gassed his life from day one. He is a daddy's frat boy who has thrown fake parties since his day from Muhlenberg college. He rips everyone off and always lies about who shows up to his parties. Trust me, with its location and downright idiotic theme..this will go under in about 18 months. If Matt had any type of brain..as this interview proves the lack thereof...he would just leave it be as a bar.. which is all it basically is.

I can't figure out if this whole PR movement of these guys at the Eldridge is a joke or serious? As an owner of a few lounges in downtown, they seem pretty absurd. Matt Levine is talking like he is reinventing the bar business, wow, take out menus??? A doorman??? Cocktails??? Celebs??? Come on dude, if you are going to talk this much, come up with some cool concepts. This place will be a real flash in the pan and I hope they save all of their press clippings because it will be a short run. I live in the LES and have my lounges down here hope they don't come down here and stink it up. Hey,at least his publicist is getting it out there. Good luck.

Despite proclamations that he doesn't want press for his new bar/lounge/dance club/date spot/multi-cuisine restaurant The Eldridge, Matt Levine sat down for yet another interview, this time with our good friends at Citysearch. We just finished reading and there is goo dripping out of our eyes and ears, but we pulled ourselves together to bring you some of the choicest bits:Most bars, lounges and nightclubs focus on drinks and bottles. At The Eldridge, we focus on customers. It's not the drink you make, it's how you deliver it. With The Eldridge, it's a business, but it's not about the money. Sundays we will have a saxophonist, Mondays we will be doing a movie night, Tuesdays we will have a trumpet player, Wednesdays we will have a drummer, and Thursdays a flute player. To recap, the drink isn't important as long as it is served in an innovative way. We suggest in a diaper. Also, the Eldridge is a business, but it's not about the money. They just want $12-$36 per drink (for real gold flakes), but it's not about the money. And if you are lucky enough to get inside on Thursday, you will be treated to a flute player. We think they call themselves flutist. Oh, and please read the comments that either mental patients or Matt himself left to prop himslef up. Oh no, the goo is back. Goo!

I have provided interviews for most other blogs and since DBTH is the most fabulous blog on the block I decided to save the best for last by giving you never before read exclusives on some policies of the \"Eldridge\". I will from now on reference the \"Eldridge\" in parenthesis as I have decided it is not just a nightlife venue but a metaphorical movement with cash registers, a movement toward unsurpassed luxury. Our newest concept is the bathroom getaway experience for our most VIP of customers a short list that includes myself Ivan Drago of Rocky IV fame and some 1st cousins from Long Island. I can guarantee it will be the most exclusive bathroom outside of Okinawa. There will be two armored guards that will not allow anyone inside unless one of three passwords are spoken. The passwords are in obscure Middle Eastern Chinese and Hungarian dialects that only a handful of Rhodes scholars and my patrons will know. Once inside of the lavatory your experience will begin with badays that clean rectums with only the finest Armand De Brignac champagne no toilet paper instead there will be a chaperone supervising a butler as he/she wipes your anus until you are properly satisfied. I do not believe this concept has been replicated elsewhere and will without a doubt change Eldridge Street no even better the Lower east Side into a true nightlife destination, I will be responsible for coining the phrase \"the new meatpacking\". Can you feel the energy ?WBG

Is it the dog days of summer or what? There is hardly anything going on today, so we have decided to post some of the most boring things we could find. Why? Because we can, that's why.This just came across the Birdy wire through our awesome anonymous tipline, but we have no idea what it means. \"GOAG is reporting that Izzy Gold gave away $10,000 in Times Sq., but person claiming to be Izzy Gold is not Francesco Civetta...looks like Chris Young. Is Chris the new Izzy Gold? Did Francesco cede the persona voluntarily, or was there a coup of sorts or some sort of rift b/w Brad and Francesco (who are not facebook friends)? Please get to the bottom of this.\" SNOOZE. ZZZZZZZZZZZZ. Leave us alone. A reader forwarded us another pitch for Country Club, the new MPD drink joint that is Bellini crazy. The email claims \"The menu is focused on 15 interpretations of the classic Bellini along with a retro-infused cocktail program and bottle service. \" Can anyone explain what a retro-infused cocktail program is? Anyone? Another winning idea is Execulife, \"a membership-based organization committed to creating a high-energy social environment where active business professionals can interact and share experiences with other successful, like-minded individuals.\" We have a few experiences we've been dying to share, but haven't had a venue in which we felt comfortable. Thank the lord we now have Execulife. Is this really the best you have publicists and Birdy's? Consider yourselves fired.

Photo courtesy of Ruby Washington/NY TimesCould Brooklyn Bowl possibly be the greatest music venue ever assembled? By combining a 600 person capacity performance space, 16 bowling lanes, Blue Ribbon food and LEED certified design (heady brah), the answer is probably yes. The former iron foundry on Wythe Avenue at North 11th Street in Williamsburg is still under construction, but owner Peter Shapiro thinks it will be a desired venue for bands to play when they roll through NYC, saying \"if you’re in a band or crew, you think you’re going to play the normal rock club that has no food and no bowling? After sound check, you can eat some Blue Ribbon and bowl. I think the crews will be pretty psyched.\" Makes sense to us. [NY Times]

Good news sports fans - the New York version of the boho hipster fave Ace Hotel has hit the web with an uber boring website. The hotel, at the site of the former Breslin at 29th and Broadway, is still being renovated but they are hiring several for several hotel positions in case you are looking for work. One job is for food and bev manager, so you would probably get some heavy Ken Friedman interaction, and there is nothing wrong with that.

Photo courtesy of GawkerMontauk got itself an authentic summer hotspot with the Surf Lodge and centuries of peace and tranquility at the end of Long Island came to an end. It seems that the locals reached out to Satan to see if he could help scare away the pretty young things who show up every Friday and Saturday night, and Satan sent one of his most vile creatures. Unfortunately, said creature took a break on the way to mauling everyone and drowned in the ocean, eventually washing up on shore and disappointing both Satan and the Montauk residents who were counting on him to restore the normal east end balance. At least that's what we think that is, but who really knows. It apparently washed upon the shore of Montauk over the weekend, with the Gawk thinking that \"that it's viral marketing for something. Ali Lohan's new album perhaps.\" All we know is, we are canceling all of our Hamptons plans. Forever.

Mobile Strip Club Greatest Idea of All Time??

A friend of DBTH just dropped this into our inbox, and its either the greatest idea of all time of the dumbest. Maybe you can tell us:What about this for a business idea? The mobile strip club. We buy a minivan and drive it around to the popular nightclubs in New York. At the end of the night, guys can pay $100 for entry onto the bus. The $100 is just an entry fee. They will be greeted by some of New York's most beautiful dancers, and they get to stay on the bus for 12 minutes or 3 full songs, whichever comes first. Then we drop them off and pick up the next group.What a concept! Not sure how many New York rules this would break, probably a million of them. No matter, this is much more groundbreaking than the Eldridge. It must be done!

New location, new menu. The folks from Finger on the Pulse are throwing the second of their summer party series and have passed along the menu for tomorrow's shimmy. We would love to share it with you too. Main Courses: North Carolina Style Pulled Pork and Burnt Ends Espresso Pastrami Mole Braised shredded duck Grilled peach halves with spiced chèvre caramelized shallots Sides: Sesame Noodle Salad Black Eyed Pea Succotash Collard Greens Cole Slaw Dessert: Banana coconut cornbread topped with peach compote and whipped cream The first one was a great night of music and fun, so we highly recommend checking out the second edition.

You asked and we provide. Quick Hits is back from a long vacation to quickly provide you with the quickest hit of your life. Hit and go. Quick Hits!The owners of Bread have transformed their former diner space the American into Lulu's, an upscale bistro type spot that is also serving cocktails. A Little Birdy was on the scene and reports \"he food is awesome as are the cocktails, and so so so reasonably priced. When we got there around 10:30 the place was barely busy but by the time we left at 12, the place had a ton of ppl hanging out outside, at the bar and at tables all around\". Sounds fun. The Ranolph's planned downstairs expansion still isn't finished, but according to a LB, some Randolph staffers have been clamoring for it to operate a la the private 3rd Floor. Not so fast, as it will probably just be an expanded bar. A DBTH reader was out east this weekend and headed out to the Surf Lodge and fun was had. Our reader says \"it was really fun, it's really pretty on the water and the design is pretty sweet. The bathroom situation is annoying though. I did not see Rachelle.\" Oh, don't let that ruin your perfect night.

GNML sat down with Matt Levine to talk about his upcoming project the Eldridge. We actually have to hand it to Mr. Lewis, he managed to finally push back a bit with his interview subject, admitting to being \"stunned\" by the prospect of opening a bottle service place in the LES. In order to save you a few brain cells, here are some choice ML tidbits:I feel as far as trends go that everything originates from the Lower East Side. Everything from music to style. I think the Lower East Side is the next hot spot for New York City. Right across the street I have Thompson LES opening up, the new Thompson Hotel; so it’s got a cool vibe – it’s a chill vibe down there. With this, I didn’t just want to read the book, I wanted to write the book, if you know what I mean. I wanted to get creative with it. I wanted to do something different. I feel that when you’re at a table and your ordering drinks or bottles or whatever it may be, why not have a nice food element? Why not deliver? We’re gonna have menus on hand so that when people do want something to eat along with their drinks, they can go ahead and order a sushi roll if they want. We will have four or five menus on hand. It will be a date spot like at Rose Bar, it’s a good place to bring a date. Then it’s like you’re at 1 Oak where you can dance. It will be everything all in one. This place really is the gift that keeps on giving. As per the menus, we went to Standings a few weeks ago and got burgers delivered - so this doesn't seem to be ground breaking. Having a chef who can cook any cuisine at 3 AM would be a real accomplishment. A girl can dream. [GNML]

File this under better late than never. In NY Mag Intelligencer column last week, a few NYC nightlife kingpins declared that Dubai is the next Las Vegas in terms of opportunity. Even though Dubai is a global financial center and not a cyclical tourist destination, we get their drift. But as a reader points out, Charles Ferri, owner of Chelsea’s Star Lounge, perhaps sums it up as inappropriately as possible, saying \"They’re finding a balance between religion and entertainment and tourism. Things are just blowing up out there.\" Egggh. Was there no other expression you could find Chuck?

Photo courtesy of Page Six MagazineSuperstar man about town Joshua David Stein digs deep into the empire and discovers that all is not well in the house of Cipriani. Besides the outrageous rents and slow down in the economy, the Italian nightlife kings are dealing with that little tax problem - the one where they didn't pay them - and it could be the final nail in their Bellini sipping coffin. As JDS explains:According to New York state law, with few exceptions, felons cannot hold liquor licenses. Clearly for Cipriani—a company whose patriarch is a felon—this presents a dilemma. Cipriani originally dealt with the problem by leaving Arrigo’s name off the licenses, listing Giuseppe as the licensee. This flying above the law did not pass muster with Boyle. On May 7, 2008, the State Liquor Authority moved to revoke the licenses of all the Cipriani venues in New York on the grounds that they had knowingly omitted a felon’s name.Obviously, the Cipriani's are doing everything possible to maintain their licenses, but a final SLA decision has not been made. Until then, expect all of their venue's to remain crowded with those seeking the average food, quality service and outrageous prices that are the family's trademark.

But it's not all hot bodies and throwing down off the Spanish coast this season, as one Little Birdy who just returned tells us \"Everyone is complaining about the economy, exorbitant drink and cover charge prices, and the fact that most clubs are not at capacity. That's what you get when you charge $100 entrance!\" We weep for you Ibiza. Certainly our fair Hamptons would never treat you like that.

regarding The Eldridge interview:he's TRYING to be funny but his poor taste in humor is a cover up from years of being sexually abused by his father. Look at the pic, it is written all over his face. Maybe when he is walking down Eldridge on a late weekday evening some doper will look at this punk and beat his ass for his wallet. It should teach him.I just hope he is not stupid enough to point out during his ass whipping that he \"owns\" a club on Eldridge. Cause that may lead to a kid napping.

Grub Street's amazing interview with nightlife king Matt Levine just keeps getting more great comments (91 at last count). Most of them are negative, but not all. Commenter xdfxdfxdf is a card carrying FOML, and has been laying down the truth about just how great the Eldridge and their clients (not customers of course) we be. Here are his comments. haters, if you had the ability to get your hands on a laser-engraved entry card you might have a different perspective. I'm happy to take any of you as my plus-one August 7th when Matt has the soft opening. If you saw the list of people with cards you might want to take me up on the offer. Of the 650 cards that have gone out, none are to swag celebs. I was almost a plus-one until last month. pays to model Steelo after all. FYI, SlopeBoy, Tom Cruise decided that he was going to pass on the laser card - not because he didn't want to be involved, but because he didn't want to take one away from a local elite. Basically, he told Matt that he and Kate would come along as guests of two VERY well known couples. And, just so that you understand who does matter - MKO and Ashley are not on the list - swag doesn't get an invitation. The reason why I have a laser card and you don't is simple - I happen to be somebody that people want to actually hang out with. Regarding Tom [Cruise], he is cool - saying he isn't is ludicrous but I can't fault you for not knowing any better - you aren't able to socialize with him (or call him a friend as I do) because you can't get into anywhere that is exclusive enough that he would be there. Regarding Reyka, try it over ice in a highball glass and I can promise that your opinion will be changed forever. Have fun with your swag crowd at whatever clubs you frequent after waiting in long lines. Oh, and say hi to the Olsen twins this weekend - you can even tell Mary Kate that XD said hello. So, Tom Cruise won't have his own card but will be coming by with his friends who are well known and will have a card. Also, the soft opening will be August 7, which is a Thursday and of course not a weekend when all of the card holders are out of town. But what we want to know is, what if every card holder wants to come at the same time? It only holds 130 people. This is a tricky spot, but we trust that Matt and his door staff/promotions director will figure it out.

Photo courtesy of EaterJust like everyone and their mother, DBTH put on our Ralph Lauren cable knits and popped our collars (see photo above) and skipped to the press opening of Country Club on 14th last night. The space was the old Dirty Disco space- a cursed space if there ever was one, gruesomely conceived of and designed by Jack Dakin. The Country Club team has done a nice job of righting the ship and the space is comfortable and airy. There is a definite nod to the country club aesthetic, updated for the modern day Meatpacking with the obligatory crocodile skin banquettes. The bar gimmick here is bellinis, and since there are so few nightspots that can execute a mean cocktail list, and given that this place will probably draw a crowd, it was smart to concentrate on something simple like bellinis. There is a double digit flavor list, including blood orange, pomegranate and roasted pear. We liked roasted pear the best. Oh, and let's not forget the Country Club Punchbowl for $125. Country Club feels a bit more mellow and welcoming than some other recent Meatpacking spots. The grand opening party this Saturday night will feature Travis McCoy from Gym Class Heroes.

Noah and Jason's latest Las Vegas project Lavo, inspired by the bathhouses of ancient Mediterranean culture, is getting set for its big desert premiere in August. Additional details about the AvroKo designed space continue to trickle out, such as this fascinating tidbit from HD Mag, saying \"Worn tile walls and water-stained plaster flank the lounge entry. Ceilings of old wood and low chandeliers rise 20 feet above an area with a curved bar, leather seating, and Moroccan tables. Turkish water basins surround the glass and wood screened bridge that leads to the second-floor nightclub. Vaulted glazed tile arches open to a domed ceiling above the dance floor.\" Sounds bathhouse fabulous. We are running out to get our rubber ducky right now.

Eponymous Cocktails: The Rusty Knot

***CONTENT
In our latest installment of Eponymous Cocktails, we travel to the banks of the mighty Hudson River to speak and drink with Toby Maloney, the cocktail director for The Rusty Knot. As always, Eponymous Cocktails is co-production with our good friends at A Medium Format.DBTH: Please tell us how the concept for the Rusty Knot’s cocktail menu came about.Toby Maloney: I knew it was going to have five drinks, and we decided that the drinks would be Tiki inspired. DBTH: Why Tiki and why five?TM: Well, the Rusty Knot is obviously nautically themed, and it just kind of grew organically from there. I had found this amazing Tiki bar in Chicago where I have the Violet Hour, and I went to check that out and it was just this amazing space. Terrible drinks, but an amazing space, and it inspired me to try to re-think what is considered Tiki. And five drinks because I only do things in prime numbers.DBTH: So how is this concept applied at the Rusty Knot?TM: We re-interpreted the drinks using only fresh ingredients. Normal Tiki uses so many bottled sweetners with artificial flavors, so we moved away from that. For example, the house cocktails all use our home made sour mix as a base. This place is so packed every night that the staff doesn’t have to time to muddle each drink as it’s ordered. The bartenders pre make it and it allows them to crank out hundreds of these drinks a night.DBTH: Let’s talk about the Rusty Knot itself. What did everyone want it to be?TM: Well, Taavo told me that the drink had to be frozen, had to be served in a plastic glass, and needed to cost $7. He wanted it to be moderately priced, just like the tap beers and cans. It’s that kind of place. DBTH: That price point limits your options a bit. Where do you go from there?TM: Well, I had 6 or 7 things in mind. After we tried them out, this one was the clear winner. DBTH: What is the Rusty Knot?TM: (laughing) It’s a Frozen Trinidadian Mint Daiquiri made with fresh mint, rum, sour mix, and blended with crushed ice. Try it.DBTH: Very refreshing. TM: Exactly. These are the drinks that I would want if I swam up to a pool bar when I was on vacation. DBTH: Are you surprised at the success of the Rusty Knot?TM: No. When you put Taavo and Ken together, you know you are going to draw a crowd. But what I am surprised at is the success of the cocktails. People love them! DBTH: And did you enjoy putting the menu together and helping oversee it?TM: Yeah! It was great putting this menu together, doing something a bit more wistful then a normal cocktail lounge. We’re still fine tuning the operation, but I am very happy with the results.

My only memory of Toby and the Knot is an after party for the best new chefs event, I believe I had an amazing time. Needless to say I was a bit embarrassed the next day when I had to retrieve my wallet cell phone and glasses, I did however leave my dignity at the bar. All I clearly remembered was being dragged out high fiving and hugging the bar staff. Good times :)

First outside, then a close up of the WC, and now a full reveal. Behold, FiveLeaves, the nautically themed bar that is preparing to open in Greenpoint at the corner of Lorimer and Bedford, the Mecca of all things Brooklyn. The space was designed and built by John McCormick, the owner and designer of Moto in Williamsburg and designer of Smith and Mills in Tribeca. The little details are impeccable, and we expect Five Leaves to be a charming and welcome addition to the area. The work is almost complete, so an opening could occur sometime in the next few months. Stay tuned. More images from inside after the jump:

I would like to point out (i can no longer bite my tongue over this) that john mccormick has been taking credit for the work of both smith & mills and taylor, both jobs that he essentially assisted on while works mfg. genius, alex kravchuk, gets no credit here on grub street. come on people! mccormick and business partner bill phelps did a beautiful job on Moto. But credit on all these other jobs? it's too much. no doubt it's hard making an impression in the design business, but i have to give mr. kravchuk the props he deserves. and that beautiful steel kitchen facade shown in the photos above? yes, mr. kravchuk.

Thank you for your comments Gina. I happen to agree with you on the failure of different websites to mention all the key people involved in the projects that Ive been fortunate enough to be a part of in the last few years.(Especially Alex Kravchuk) It has been a distressing aspect to that part of my life. Each project, in every respect was indeed a collaboration. With many people contributing their talents and craftsmanship to these wonderful places. I have always done my best, when questioned about projects Im involved in, to provide details the people involved, the spelling of their names, contact numbers and my relationship to them whether it be an on going partnership or creative collaboration on specific projects. Sadly, most of this information is not pursued or never makes it online. This has also caused me to steer away from interviews and questions about projects of late.So rather than just read comments that would cause me to bite my own tongue, I will tell you honestly I am not and have not been \"taking credit\" I have been wrongly 'given credit' however. When it comes to things of this nature Im about as socialist as you can get.I enjoy the work that I do and I hope to continue working with all these wonderful people making inviting and lovely spaces to gather and enjoy life.-John

Why can't we just celebrate the beauty of a job well done regardless of who hammered what nail? You can bet John is not keeping score on who-did-what. John is the most unassuming person you will ever find. He will do great work regardless of if it is connected to someone famous past, present or future. If he finds someone that will bust their ass with him or for him, you can bet they are recognized, and they know who they are. For the record, nothing that has been posted \"glorifying\" his name was written or can be said to be quoted by him. This whole thing has been a media \"scoop\" brought about by muckrakers. GETOVERIT

Heath Ledger Is On The Bright Side Of Things Wed, 06 August 2008 The restaurant-bar the late Heath Ledger wanted to open in New York’s Brooklyn is nearly complete.“Heath was very, very into it,” Jud Mongell, Heath’s longtime pal and business partner, tells Life & Style. “He drew the floor plans and thought of the name — BrightSide — because it’s on the bright side of McCarren Park.” The nautical-themed eatery, which is scheduled to open later this summer, will have personal touches from Heath. For instance, a chessboard will be engraved into one of the tables. “Heath was a big chess player,” notes Jud. “The whole idea was to make it a spot for us. We wanted to make it our own space to hang out.”Heath also wanted a family style table. “He specifically talked about having a place for him and his family to sit,” adds John McCormick, who designed the bar. “It was great working with Heath. He was the most unassuming guy.”

Five Leaves is named for when there are only 5 cigarettes left in a pack, not Nick Drake's song? What the hecke!

2008-09-13 03:22:00
All I can say is that HEath loved this restaurant idea more than antyhing else and to see it finished with one of the names he chose, then surely that's what really matters? Not who's saying what about who designed what. After all, theis project was his and Jud's, so long as you keep that in mind what does the rest matter? The way I see it, it's a dream realised and when it's finished the name will be above the door. :) Winks for Heath.

Hey, you, JG - 2nd commenter on this post. Where have you been living? In the fitting rooms in Forever21? You have got to be kidding me with that comment. Did you move her 6 months ago and are just now realizing there are other parts of this city other than shitty, overrated neighborhoods like Union Square and the East Village (RIP). Well, I'm sure you won't last 3 years here anyway, but please, keep that mentality before hopping on the L ONE STOP into BK to visit this lovely little place. I hear 7A is amazing - why don't you eat there instead? I mean, it's WAY COOL because it's on 7th and Ave A... Unless you still believe that \"alphabet city\" is dangerous.

So, it seems like we stumped everyone. This small space on the corner of Bedford and Lorimer is tentatively called The Five Leaves, and will be opened by one of Heath Ledger's close friends. The late actor, who's last movie is obviously doing pretty well, was a key backer of the the project and was going to be a full partner. His untimely death put the project in jeopardy, but his father became executor of the estate and because he knew how much the project meant to heath, he released the funds to finish construction. The name Five Leaves is a working name, and comes from Swan cigarette papers that tell you when there are just five left in a package. A bit later, we will take you inside the nautically themed cafe and bar.

Five Leaves, Brightside, and G’Point tavern is the name, depending on which article you read.He chose the building, according to an article for the following reason, hothing to do with TDK.The “Dark Knight” star chose the narrow storefront across the street from McCarren Park while skateboarding around Williamsburg and Greenpoint with Longell.“I showed him other spots, and he wouldn’t look at anything else,” Longell told People Magazine. “He liked this corner. He envisioned basically just hanging out at the park across the street. He was a big fan of Williamsburg.”

I'm really confused after reading these two stories. What the heck is the name of this awesome place\"? And as you will read in the article, the reason for choosing that boarded up building has nothiing to do witih the Dark, Knight. I hope all this fits here. I want to know everything about Heath, and even though I live across the country, because he designed it and is full of his personal touches, I'm happily filying across the country to eat there!I'll put each article into different posts.

Yet another name!. This is from July 31Call it the Heath Bar! Actor Ledger was silent partner in G’Point tavernBy Ben MuessigThe Brooklyn PaperThe Brooklyn Paper / Allison BosworthBefore he died, Heath Ledger invested in the Five Leaves Bar, which is expected to open soon at the corner of Bedford Avenue and Lorimer Street in Greenpoint. Call it the Heath Bar.Late actor — and former Brooklynite — Heath Ledger will be involved in at least one new project: before his death in January, Ledger was a silent partner in a watering hole at the corner of Bedford Avenue and Lorimer Street.Tentatively named “The Five Leaves” after a record by the late folk crooner Nick Drake, the bar and restaurant will have a nautical theme designed by some of the creative types behind restaurants including Moto at the corner of Broadway and Hooper Street and Manhattan’s Smith and Mills, the nightlife blog Down by the Hipster reported last week.Five Leaves will serve high-end comfort food created by a former sous-chef from Diner, a nearby restaurant, an insider told The Brooklyn Paper.The upscale American cuisine shouldn’t come as a surprise, considering that one of Ledger’s partners in the project is Jud Longell, a bartender and waiter at the epicurean comfort food destination Dumont on Union Avenue. The “Dark Knight” star chose the narrow storefront across the street from McCarren Park while skateboarding around Williamsburg and Greenpoint with Longell.“I showed him other spots, and he wouldn’t look at anything else,” Longell told People Magazine. “He liked this corner. He envisioned basically just hanging out at the park across the street. He was a big fan of Williamsburg.”©2008 The Brooklyn Paper

SAME DATE AS PREVIOUS...EACH ARTICLE HAS A DIFFERENT NAME!Heath Ledger's Restaurant About To Open Before his death, Heath Ledger wanted to open up a restaurant/bar in Brooklyn. His partner and longtime friend Jud Mongell says Heath was really hands-on in getting the doors open. He says, \"He drew the floor plans and thought of the name — BrightSide — because it's on the bright side of McCarren Park.\" The space has a nautical theme, and is scheduled to open by the end of the summer. As expected, it will include a lot of personal touches from Heath, like a chessboard being engraved into the tables because he loved the game. Jud says, \"Heath was a big chess player.The whole idea was to make it a spot for us. We wanted to make it our own space to hang out. He specifically talked about having a place for him and his family to sit. It was great working with Heath. He was the most unassuming guy.\"BrightSide sounds like a great place and such a nice dedication to the late Heath Ledger. Make sure to stop by if you're in the area!

The Eldridge sure seems like the great hotspot of 2008. Here is what the people are saying about it:Dear Matt Have you lost your f@%*/ing mind! This is exactly why the nightlife in NYC has turned to shit. [Eater] I wouldn't Pi55 in this place - I hope this guy gets taken to the cleaners, but then again his trust fund would most likely bail him out. [Eater] The only thing this establishment is doing is perpetuating everything that's wrong with New York City night life. \"We have 400 laser-engraved entry cards...so Naeem knows that theyÃ¢Â€Â™re good...\" That is grad-A certified garbage. Just family and friends my ass, so many names were dropped in that interview I am surprised the journalist was able to walk out of the room without tripping. [NY Mag] rather than hostesses, we'll call them hookers, rather than bathroom attendants, we'll call them drug dealers. rather than owners, we'll call them idiots [NY Mag] Wow -- this whole CONCEPT gives me that \"not-so-fresh\" feeling. [DBTH] It seems the people have spoken. But Matt and Naeem, we still want our Friends of cards. Pretty please

@ Truth Be Told : I don't even know who that (Micah) is, its called Google image I did it because I wanted to know what the guy looked like who claimed he would \"change the face of nightlife as we know it\"and keep out all the poor scum. Please Listen, I am all for hot new spots opening but to make such claims I mean honestly try a little humility. You all sound like new money with rude remarks regarding the general public and a general narrow mindedness. You are going about achieveing this thing we call \"cool\" in all the wrong ways. You are doing yourself a disservice right now and I honestly am beginning to feel bad for you guys. So I will no longer comment bash you. You don't know me and I sure as hell don’t know you, in the next few months as the buzz dies and your profits plummet I hope you learn from this situation.

The place is doomed. I've lived above this space for 6 years. It's next door to sapphire (I think the space is owned by the same guy), and no one has been able to capture a crowd. The space has flipped at least 3 times in 4 years. Doormen look awkward standing out front, and they always look like they're hoping someone will come in. Cursed, I'm telling you.

This guy Matt Levine is a fugly scrub who has gassed his life from day one. He is a daddy's boy (where he got his money and clothing line from due to his dads fabric company) who has thrown fake parties since his days from Muhlenberg college. He rips everyone off and always lies about who shows up to his parties. Trust me, with its location and downright idiotic theme..this will go under in about 18 months. Just ask him how his CELEB PACKED parties at GLO went (remember that place? HAHAHAHAHAHAH!!) if Matt had any type of brain..as his interviews prove the lack thereof...he would just leave it be as a bar.. which is all it basically is.

The Cooper Square Hotel seems to have a lot of things going against it. First, the glassy design has few fans. Second, its East Village neighbors couldn't hate it more than they already do, doing everything in their power to gum up their plans to open several hospitality spaces. But why let those things get in your way? Answer: They didn't. After a long wait, the Coop is finally ready to be put to productive use, making itself available to Fashion Week event planners. Above are some of the computer animated drawings that are being sent around. The hotel will be available for all sorts of fancy dinners, cocktail events, sack races, etc. Oh, and their nifty and bare website is up and running too.

The Eldridge has gotten a ton of hype thanks to GoaG's uber nightlife personalities Scott and Naeem. And why wouldn't it? The place will have butlers, chaperones, porters, table attendants, and a hospitality consultant, all crammed into a tiny little place with 13 tables across the street from of the Lower East Side's finest housing. Just what we all need. Like our friends at Grub Street, we too actually are excited by the Charlotte Voisey cocktails, but are not too sure that these guys will be able to consistently execute the menu once its packed with their super exclusive customers sucking down all of those vodka sodas.But here's a little juice you didn't. Thanks to another superstar Little Birdy, we learn that \"Cole Bernard the owner/partner of the famed club Runway is an investor/partner in The Eldridge. This should give you an inkling of how good the Eldridge will be. Long Island Girls Galore.\" Our Little Birdy also tells us that Naeem from GoaG will be a doorman/promoter, which is probably why they could say \"The Eldridge is going to be more exclusive and luxurious than anything currently out there. It is going to raise the bar on New York nightlife.\" Nothing like a little self promotion by those discerning night life voices. Pitty for us that we won't ever get in. Boo hoo. Boo hoo everyone. Boo hoo.

Those cheeky Aussies have done it again. According to the Daddy, the folks at Kingswood have been running themselves a little underground den of debauchery for the past few months and neglected to tell the public at large. According to UD's intel: To get in on the action, enter the unmarked door to the right of the restaurant. (You'll know you're there when you bump into five or six Aussies smoking on the sidewalk.) Descend the narrow stairway and find your way into the dark, inviting bar and adjacent black-boothed lounge, divided by a wall of jars, each holding its own orange betta fish. On any given night, the room is filled with beautiful people of all ilk—fun-loving folks from Down Under, fashion-industry types and, of course, the mandatory couple of celebs dancing on tables.Sounds positively delicious, for the nights when the place is actually crowded. But if you are looking to get in, come prepared with the name of your favorite AFL team, the definition of a round-a-bout, and a serious case of good on ya.

Hot summer Thursdsay's mean hot summer parties. We sent our intern hit squad to cover Sephora's 10 year anniversary party, produced by none other than M. Satsky. Here's what they saw.Besides in-store events, Sephora threw itself quite the 10yr birthday bash at the Angel Orensanz Foundation in the LES last night. Performances by Natsaha Beddingfeld and Ashanti, music by Samantha Ronson, free-flowing Cliquot and Belvedere, signature cocktails like \"Lipstick Lover,\" Sephora cupcakes, and a huge cardboard cake replaced the pinata and buttercream frosting memories from every 10yr birthday party I can remember. By the time we rolled in around 1130ish, Natasha Beddingfeld had already gone on but a surprise fedora-d guest star had joined her girlfriend in the DJ booth. Overall, we enjoyed a festive yet subdued vibe in the church converted to a theater converted to a party space - which was strangely well-lit and pretty damn hot (both physically and otherwise). Ashanti came out around 12; however, the DIY-gift bags definitely stole the show. Previously tame and civilized revelers pushed and stomped on feet to access freebies from Stila, Calvin Klein, Laura Geller, and other big brand cosmetics. Sephora Professionale makeup cases that weighed about 10lbs were free to those opposed to extra baggage. Always the ambitious ones, we took two. They began to cramp our style about five minutes later. Luckily, we were able to convince the girl working at the bodega around the corner to trade one for a pack of Dunhills. Pretty sweet deal if you ask me. The prevalence of vintage clothing, Sephora employees, and models was quite astounding. Guys, I'd ballpark the ratio at about 6:1. Too bad you missed the boat. Maybe in the next 10 years.

Just another overrated NYC party with ugly girls. God, those women look horrendous! are they really women, or men in drag? is this what NYC has to offer? too bad that NYC will never have the women and nightlife of Chicago. Chicago 4 life!

[Photo courtesy of NY Mag] It seems that Cordato's fun little secret has got the neighbors riled up again. The seedy slice joint at 94½ Greenwich St has had a reputation as a place for a beer and a dance for quite some time, but today's Downtown Express revisits the rumor once again, after owner Gerry Giakoumatos recently applied for and received approval for a cabaret license that Gerry wanted because \"he has a jukebox, and patrons occasionally get up to dance to the music.\" DE turns to Yelp commenters who spill the dirty secret, including one who said \"wandered in after work for a drink and was surprised to see a group of scantily clad women giving lap dances.\" And what's wrong with that? Giakoumatos tries to put the rumor to bed, saying \"everybody gets the wrong impression\". We feel for Gerry. Most people just don't get that the women who get money to dance half naked aren't strippers and certainly aren't employed by the club. They just happen to be very good dancers who don't like to wear clothes. Get it straight people.

Buried deep inside a recap of one of their frequent nights on the town, GoaG's louche reporters Scott and Naeem (no relation) give word that the Lower East Side is going to be blesed with yet another bar. While enjoying dinner, designer Matt Levine told them of his new bar, so they blabbed:The Eldridge is the name of the new club that is going to be opening within the next couple of weeks. We know you've all heard this before, but we believe this time it's true, the Eldridge is going to be unlike any club in New York City. The Eldridge is going to be more exclusive and luxurious than anything currently out there. It is going to raise the bar on New York nightlife. And that's all we can say…for now.Well, that's not all we can say. The Eldridge is going to replace the now shuttered Luv 24-7 on Eldridge. As for being \"more exclusive and luxurious than anything currently out there\", well that's just those two being being silly.

Delicatessen kicked off a furious week of publicity with a grand opening fiesta last night. Thrown by Interview Magazine and sponsored by Belvedere (can they sponsor us already?), the space was packed to the gills with NYC's beautiful crowd. We spotted everyone who is anyone, including that girl you like and her cousin, the guy who did that thing that makes everyone jealous. They are so cool. The Prince street wall was completely open, with the crowd spilling out onto the sidewalk patio space. The jeans were tight, the music was loud, and the community was kicking itself for ever giving these people their permits. Additional pic after the jump.

Last night was the second in Belvedere's oh so fabulous Downtown Meets Uptown party series. We tipped you a bit yesterday that it was coming, and this party was billed as \"Baise en Ville at the subMercer.\" The night began with an intimate dinner for 24 in the salon of Kiki de Montparnasse catered by Fiamma's Fabio Trabocchi. We spotted Josh Lucas, Damon Dash, Andre Balazs and Moby. The party then moved on to the subMercer where we were welcomed by a cellist, a naughty nurse, a naked chess player and two ballerinas floating around. Belvedere cocktails provided a surge of energy from the food coma. Late into the night, silver platters of erotic toys including bondage tape and handcuffs were passed around, courtesy of Kiki de Montparnasse.We go to a lot of these parties, but the Downtown Meets Uptown series never seems to disappoint. Really, the formula is quite simple. All we need are quality cocktails and good food, and the lobster, Pine Island Oysters, and Basil Ice Cream did the trick. Signature Belevedere cocktails designed for the event included the Sweet and Sour Kiss, the Fleur de Citron and the Watermelon Kick. Another fine, fine job by the entire team.

JE Englebert Is Actually From Staten Island

JE Englebert is the owner of sub par nightclubs Prime and Suzie Wongs and also loves to send out stupid press releases. He is also from Staten Island. Now it is all coming together. Today's missive states:John \"JE\" Englebert President of the Staten Island Good Neighborhood Association is calling for a boycott of Belmar New Jersey by Staten Islanders. An apology is not good enough. The group wants the Mayor Kenneth Pringle who insulted Staten Island to spend 24 hours in the crown island jewel of New York. He would be treated to the local cuisine including a night at the Staten Island Hotel. The Staten Island Good Neighbor Association wants to take him on a tour of the place people love to dump on. If he refuses the group plans a fundraiser to give for the candidate that runs against him in the next election and boycott ads will be placed in local newspapers across Staten Island. Sounds like a really good cause to be involved with. We don't care about any of this at all. We just love to see Shaolin fighting with the NJ town that just reinstated the right to have a keg party and give the finger, and that the bane of NYC nightlife has gotten involved. Oh, we also heard from a Little Birdy that both of JE's clubs are for sale and that El Presidente is looking to get out. Wouldn't that be terrible?

They are exploring many options in regards to expanding their venues not only in Miami but across the country. Details to come soon.\" That's PR speak for \"how did you find that out?\" But we want to know, how can there be multiple One of a Kind nightclubs and still be considered truly One of a Kind? And, will the paintings be travelling south?

***CONTENT
We boldly sent our mysterious editorial interns to the still running French Tuesday affair at the still happening APT and amazingly, they lived to write about. Here is their story. The French, perhaps influenced by our own expatriates such as Hemingway and the like in the 1920s have descended upon NYC in droves with bimonthly \"French Tuesdays\" to give us a taste of our own medicine. Except instead of absinthe-fueled philosophical discussions with tortured souls you get $13 champagne and multinational flirtations. Even the bouncers hail from across the pond, so I-just-rolled-out-of-bed, Rag and Bone/Band of Outsiders/Earnest Sewn chic is simply not tolerated. They don't care if your jeans are bespoke. You may be let in without showering, but not unless you're wearing a jacket. However, being on the list didn't seem to matter. Lest we forget, they invented the word \"blase.\" Were we seriously in the MePa? We'll take French Tuesdays over self-important bouncers at mediocre clubs next door any day. A mish-mosh appropriate only of New York greeted us inside. Live Latin music. French men in suits chatting up romance-starved thirtysomething New York women in Italian labels. Italian, Spanish, French and English words. A shrine to Moet et Chandon barely passing for a bar. A funny little man named (wait for it) Pierre scurrying around, seeing that everyone mixed and mingled. At one point during this understated yet thoroughly enjoyable international fete, we found ourselves talking to Italians who lamented the difficulty of meeting \"real\" New Yorkers. We are indeed a rare breed, frequenting speakeasies and dismissing places like APT before they've opened. This particular (French) Tuesday reminded us that we actually live in a place worth living in. And that sometimes an apertif made from the best grapes (and shipped overseas, bien sur) really hits the spot.

For some reason, we get a shit ton of commenters pontificating on the perfection that is Chicago nightlife and simultaneously ripping our fair New York. Now don't get us wrong - we love us some Chitown. Cubby Bear North, Bacchus II, Rocket and all that jazz. But what it really boils down to is the Weiner Circle, an average hot dog stand that stays open late and is where drunk Chicagoans head to vent. They scream, they yell, they fight, and they eat sassage. Weiner Circle is Chicago nightlife.

that's great, DBTH. you just displayed your NYC elitism by posting a clip on weiner circle. it's interesting that you fail to mention the upscale Chicago venues like stone lotus, underground, manor, rino, rednofive, bon v, y-bar, and countless others. perhaps you should post videos of the filthy garbage infested streets of NYC?
Chicago Rules
2008-07-15 14:20:00
Chicago nightlife and women are so far superior to NYC that it's not even close. NYC=guidos, trashy B&T, and pale ugly girls from the northeast. Chicago=hot blondes, Big 10 sorority girls, nice friendly people. NYC's nightlife is horrendously overrated. there's a couple of decent clubs and bars, but it doesn't match the depth and quality of Chicago.

NYC's decline
2008-07-15 14:39:00
FU, Although underground is not as good as it was last summer, it's still a happening spot and miles better than what NYC offers. there are other new spots that have opened up in Chicago, that are simply amazing, in terms of ambience and quality of women. every decent NYC spot eventually gets taken over by B&T and other violent thugs. look at the fights that broke out recently in 1oak and upstairs, just to name a few examples. NYC lacks the class and sophistication of Chicago in every way. and given how expensive it is, the city is definitely not worth it.

After news got out that the City was looking for ways of killing the ludicrous Cabaret Laws, Mayor Bloomberg commented, \"What we're trying to do is just balance between letting people have fun and to assure people in the neighborhood that they won't be disturbed by what goes on. I think the issues with the cabaret law tend to be not around dancing. It tends to be that, when you do have dancing, they tend to have more problems with abuse of alcohol and drugs and that sort of thing.\" We are not sure if that is exactly right, but no matter the logic behind it, we wholeheartedly support the movement.

Another reason why NYC blows. In Chicago it's never too loud. All of the clubs alow dancing, but they are all soundproofed. All people from Chicago are respectful of neighbors on the streets and keep drunken conversations to whisper levels. Also, people from Chicago rarely vomit on the streets and if they ever do, they are mostly women who vomit rose petals and pearls.

Ok, can you just stop this feature now, it is just embarassing. Have you ever been to Ibiza? Do you know what it is? It's the birthplace of modern club culture. It is still a cheap destiantion for the masses, and there has been much friction about hwo the 'high end' crowd are ruining it, placing on wealth and privelige,not music and love.A far more fair comparison would be St tropez. It reveals a rather naive attitude, mr Hipster.

A source has said that Mayor Bloomberg is interested in doing away with the 82 year old cabaret license that bars must have to permit 3 or more people from dancing at the same time. There are 181 venues with a cabaret license, and new venues have a slim chance of being granted one under the current system. While we are pretty sure dancing occurs in places without a cabaret license, it would be nice to know that a bar would not be closed because of some ancient rule from the Prohibition era. Good luck Mayor Mike. [NY Daily News via Eater]

Photo courtesy of Moneyries We haven't been able to attend a Pool Party as of yet, but one of our most trusted Little Birdy's was on hand and filed this reportthey are way more conscious of capacity, maybe because it's run a lit more professional or they are trying ot get on the city's good side so they can get the park event space, so the line was massive and they weren't just letting people in. but it was no more full than a standard pool show it looked like i went to vip check in of course. VIP was real crowded, the line for the free dewars was huge and they had to do 1 drink per person. everything else was the same dodgeball, slip-n-slide top shop was giving out free shit. lots of sponsor signage this year. sixpoint beer and two boots food, which is nice ...breeders were really good i'm not too familiar with their stuff but it was good some sweet alt rock.Sounds like things are status quo over in McCarren, which is nice. The City has plans to renovate the park, meaning this could be the Pool Party's last summer. But with a large budget and the economy in the crapper, DBTH thinks JellyNYC could be back for one more summer.

There seems to be some debate as to whether Bijoux is actually open or not. As we have said before, when you open the doors and let people in, regardless of the event being private or not, you are open for bidness. If you trust our commenters, they would have believe Bijoux is the new spot. While we anxiously await our invite to the boutique lounge located below Merkato 55, here are the best of the best:\"Was there last night as well. The crowd was PERFECT. EVERYONE was absolutely gorgeous and eclectic in their own right. It lacked I-bankers which was so nice, but had your solid trust-fund boys, hipsters, TONS of models and the women were stunning. The DJ was solid as well-- a good mix of chill and clubish tunes. Can't wait to go back. If you don't know anyone, good luck at the door\"and: \"Was there last night as well and the place, music and the people were dope. The venue is very sexy and a good time was had by all. Its nice to have another place to go besides 1OAK. Will be the new hot spot for sure.\"however:\"is aremis @ the door? and lets not all blow loads until they get a couple weeks under their belt, I mean it was opening night for christs sake people, of course it was good.\"Based on early reactions, we're just about ready to declare this place the new crown jewel of the MePa come autumn. Hey Kyky and Unik... DBTH +1 please? On second thought, we might have to wait for the new Gawker embargo to be lifted. As always, comments welcome...

it's definitely open for \"bidness.\" i was there two weeks ago for a soft opening that seemed to be only for the designers and investors, and again this past friday. friday was off the hook and filled to capacity with beautiful people. the music was really good thanks to DJ david katz (who dj's most of the other top spots of the moment).... 80's, rock, electro, etc.my only criticism of the place is that some of the design elements are tacky, such as the glass display case that appears to be a shrine to bottle service, featuring a boxed set of some high-end liquor (i forget which one), jewels spread around, and what appeared to be a rock and republic style leather belt. when i saw the place virtually empty, i could see that the business model of the place is 1000% based on bottle service, and i felt that to be a little shameless, in the sense that you are made to feel very uncomfortable if you're not at one of the tables. granted, the place is very, very small.in any case, i had a great time there and i'll be happy to milk that scene for all it's worth until the next place appears, and there's a good chance i won't be spending one dime on alcohol either. ;)

The guest list? Puffy, Jermaine Dupri, Russel Simmons, Busta Rhymes, Swizz Beats and Paul Sevigny. Oh, and Richie, Scott, Eugene and Mark. Noah and Jason must be putting the finishing touches on Lavo. Live performances by, among other, KRS-One, Nice N Smooth, Doug E. Fresh and Bel Biv Devoe, now you know... yo slick blow. The one question we have, is that why do we keep seeing Puffy on those Ciroc commercials on TV, when in person, we always see him throwing down with Belvie?

Team DBTH headed down to Santo's Party House last night to check out the new Ete d'Amour weekly being put on by legenday Twilo promoter and current Made honcho Mike Bindra. More interestingly, it is also the triumphant return of the Respect Is Burning crew after a 7 year hiatus from NYC. These are the guys responsible for the original Respect parties at Twilo that featured Dimitri From Paris opening for Daft Punk. Ahh... 1998. The story goes that post-Twilo, they traveled around the world for years throwing the Respect parties, eventually returning to Paris broke. Starting from scratch, they have rebuilt the Respect franchise and having been to some of the orinials at Twilo, we were anxiously awaiting. Off to a good start, last night featured DJ James Curd from the Greenskeepers. The crowd was an eclectic downtown mix with the obvious Fracophile lean. Santo's continues to impress with a great summer lineup and the bottom line is you've got to love a club that still serves draft beer.

Is Bijoux the greatest thing to happen to Planet Earth since the launch of DBTH? According to a completely unbiased Little Birdy (who used our super anonymous and fun tip tool!), it is. LB says \"I was at Bijoux last night and the place is beautiful. Gorgeous people, great service and awesome music. I'm sure once they start promoting the place it will be slammed- it was pretty full last night. Definitely going back there soon.\" We left out the part where they have promised to name their first born Bijoux, but you get the drift. Bijoux is perfect. Go there now. Like right now. Go. We're serious. Go.

The door is tight and will probably only get tighter as more people learn about it. For now it seems like everyone inside knew the owners/staff but its a small super-sexy space- most likely going to be bungalow (circa 4 years ago) door.

Was there last night as well. The crowd was PERFECT. EVERYONE was absolutely gorgeous and eclectic in their own right. It lacked I-bankers which was so nice, but had your solid trust-fund boys, hipsters, TONS of models and the women were stunning. The DJ was solid as well-- a good mix of chill and clubish tunes. Can't wait to go back. If you don't know anyone, good luck at the door.

[Photo courtesy of Gridskipper] The Chelsea Atlantic City is putting the finishing touches on its massive renovation, but two Little Birdys stopped by and did a little walk around. Here's what they had to say: Lobby had a nice open feeling. There were two sitting sections. Funky decor. Chairs, bookshelves (either dark brown or black) with books, maybe some knicknacks. Clean feeling though, not stuffy. Sleek and clean, but comfortable and inviting. Like a quirky aunt's apartment. I remember brown chairs (I think). Feel like there was some bright/lawn green color down there. But can't quite remember. The sitting areas were colorful. But tastefully done. Lobby floor was white. Black concierge/info desk. Really friendly staff. Very nice and accommodating. Upstairs, the hallways had funky wallpaper (it was a brown and white, or brown and tan, or brown and beige - floral motif), carpet was tan, dark brown, brown striped. Dark brown doors for the rooms. Inside the room, white sheets on the bed, sort of funky geometric, kind of swirly headboard (either dark brown or black) The wallpaper was cool in there - think it was dark gray with gold etchings. Flat screen tv, two white lamps - one on each end table on each side of the bed. Kiehl's toiletries, mini bar area. Room was dark in terms of colors, cool, cozy. Definitely had a funky boutique hotel feel. In a good way though. I really liked it. Might change when people are actually there, depending on the crowd - but as a space, and based on what we saw, I liked it. But you could still tell that it used to be a Holiday Inn. Unfortunately, the 5th Floor was not open for visitors, so we will have to wait a few more weeks to see Stephen, Matt and Paul's handywork. We are seriously on the edge of our seats. Seriously.

Marriott Int'l reported its 2Q earnings, and the picture ain't pretty. Overall revenue for the hotel giant dropped 24%, and the main reason was a weakening in their US operations. Why are we telling you this? It's another troubling sign for the US travel and hospitality sector, and things seem to be trending further downward. The poor economy and job woes will keep Americans at home, but rising fuel costs and higher plane fares will keep many foreign travelers out of the US. Weak dollar or no weak dollar. And a lack of tourists could be disastrous for the restaurants and bars who signed inflated leases over the last 5 years. It's not time to crack open each other's skulls and feast on the goo inside just yet, but we see troubling times on the horizon. [WSJ]

It looks like Matt Shendel may have alternate plans for his Murrary Hill fondue spot Dip. According to several Little Birdys, the rumored plan to renovate the space are going forward. It seems that Shendel has either sold to/partnered with Parry Lee, and their plans are to create a new sports bar theme space called \"The Hill\". This concept seems much more sure fire for the Murray Hill hood than fondue, which is quite kitschy and always seems to flame out after a few years. And we love the name, showing an acceptance and love for the area that so many love to rag on. Strategic Group, which co-owns Dune with Shendel, will have no involvement with this project, with a rep saying the company has \"no intentions to open anything in Murray Hill\". See what we mean, always ragging.

I'm a girl and I do it sometimes. I wouldn't go to seedy dives but I like to go to jazz clubs or hotel bars on my own. Bar Milano is a good place for that as are Rose Bar and Louis XIV (jazz) in the East Village

rose bar? you must go on a really off time period because damien never lets in a girl who comes by herself.
hi
2008-07-08 14:44:00
as a guy, i don't really like going to bars alone. i like doing things alone, like seeing movies, but the only time i go to bars alone is to eat at a bar. maybe watch sports i think it's ok if you are a girl to go to a bar alone. why wouldn't it be? you probably clear the ay to be hit on quite a bit, though.
yea
2008-07-08 15:02:00
i would go to a bar alone to drink if i was having a rough day.
bombed_pop
2008-07-08 16:43:00
I go to bars by myself practically daily and have for years. I like to have a drink and read the paper or a book after work. There is no protocol other than order a drink. Yes, you are more likely to get hit on or chatted with, but whatever, same as when at the bar with a group of women.I find that you are also more likely to get comped by the bar, or get free drinks--the wing man pretends to feel sorry for you when his friend is too chatty is the common routine. I have regular places I go, but don't hesitate to drink alone someplace new if I have time to kill, am in a different neighborhood, or whatever.

nyc
2008-07-09 13:44:00
YES! go for it. best way to meet people, but stick to places you're familiar with. i go to rose bar, beatrice and the box quite a bit alone. since friends run those places, they look after me and i don't need to worry about safety and/or getting chatted up by losers. i've met the most amazing people this way and you don't have friends to babysit all night. go go go!!!
re: snake

bring a book and buy a cocktail. if it's too dark, just buy a cocktail and people watch. don't be afraid...there's no crime in drinking alone.

Ah, Rachelle. Friend of Steve Lewis and blogger lacking wit or ability is the second to declare that we are over. At least Captain Ben Leventhal has a wee bit of credibility, but this we laugh at. Yesterday, Private Hruska missed the boat on our fun little post about Ibiza, and then has the gall to question our Birdy who has noticed a trend of slimy promoters hanging out at Rose Bar. Funny thing about trends - they develop over a period of time, so obviously we are discussing something longer than a Thursday of a holiday weekend. Here's another trend we have noticed, everything on her two GoaG sites is utterly worthless. Maybe we shouldn't expect her to grasp these concepts. After all, this is the same person that says the Atlantis is in Dubai. Alas. We don't really care what she says. It's so boring. We just wish she would talk about her book parties, dress shopping, Hoboken, Times Square, and coverage of every single event that every single website with more than 3 readers get invited to and leave DBTH out of it. Because then we have to waste our time with things like this, and that is even more boring than reading her website.

Seriously, GoaG needs to grow up. Their \"careers\" are based on voyeurism of the \"cool clique\" whereas what I like about DBTH is that it doesn't purport to be something better than anyone else, it's just off-beat, informative, kind of scrappy and into the scene I like. News flash for Rachelle: New York is a big, diverse city and not everyone aspires to the benefit circle or cares enough about being seen to bare the traffic to the Hamptons every summer weekend. And anyway, on the Rosebar post, Stanley Stuyvesant is sitting at home at 9pm commenting on a blog...isn't he paid to be out doing something more \"glamorous?\" Maybe if they would get real lives and real interests instead of gossiping about those of others, people might take them seriously. Keyword: might.

by the way, chris m.c., rachelle is actually stanley. kind of lame that she posts under an alias when she wants to back up her real self in a post or doesn't have the balls to use her own name. it's one thing to be outed or to come out of anonymity on a blog, another to come out, but to use a fake alias. pretty lame. especially when you read how many stanley comments there are reacting to her own posts.

pretty funny rachelle. just read your comments on the other post. fact - you are not invited to high profile events and the events you do cover are lame. dont you have 8 roommates so who are you to be commenting on what is fabulous and chic. i actually like the hamptons but i've been going for a while and i didnt all of a sudden jump on the montauk bandwagon. there are two events this wkend out there and i can bet you wont be there to cover them. bc you have no clout. who are you to question this site after it has been touted by all the local media for being cutting edge and ahead of the curve. YOUR SITE HAS NEVER BROKEN A STORY.

2008-07-08 10:23:00

rachelle, you still don't get it? part of the greatness of dbth is the ability to take the piss out of someone. it's called snark, or making fun of... dubai is not the issue. you miss the whole point. you were made fun of in a sarcastic way and you are desperately trying to 'prove' yourself with inane facts. nobody cares about dubai, it doesn't matter. the point is the utter worthlessness of your content and the transparent desire that your vicariously try to be part of the scene through your site. go back to jour et nuit and shut the fuck up.

point of order:1) Snark was perfected by Gawker, and ruined by you. 2) Gofg has broken many stories. DBTH has also \"broken\" many stories, but not in the same way. When using the word \"broken\" with respect to DBTH, I am referring to the following definition of the word: \"fragmentary or incomplete\"3) This IS Stanley, not Rachelle. Just look at the IPs of the commentors and u'll realize its not the same person. 4) We never said what exactly Jamie did at Atlantis other than that he was \"involved\". And FYI, those numbers come from a reliable source. If you don't think a place can do that kind of revenue, look at TAO in Vegas. 5) This must be the most comments you've ever received on post. You'd be pumped I'm sure, until you remind yourself that they are all you commenting under different aliases. Whoops!6) I understand the concept of snark. But misrepresenting what someone wrote, i.e. \"After all, this is the same person that says the Atlantis is in Dubai.\" and thinking that it is either funny or constitutes snark, is not only disingenuous, but shows a fundamental misunderstanding of what snark actually is.Gofg might be pig vomit, but it would of course take a pig to know pig vomit. Moreover, you're squealing like a stuck pig right now as you lash out to try and retain what little cred you once had.

Stanley, obviously you are confusing snark with cattiness. Quite unbecoming on a gentleman, I must say. Furthermore, I just had a quick look at your site. It's kind of hypocritical for you to be commenting on lack of comments, no? I mean, I didn't see one on any of your recent posts.

You are obviously confusing cattiness with a misrepresentation of facts. No reader could possibly or logically deduce cattiness from that line where you claim I said something I did not. You wouldn't know snark or cattiness if it hit you over the head.

Rose Bar has enjoyed several years of being the place in New York City. Beautiful space good drinks, great music and a great crowd established Rose Bar as the creme de la creme of nightlife. But is that all over? Last week, new blogger Chipping Mademoiselle detailed a battle of promoters inside Rose Bar fighting to have the most girls at their table, just the sort of scene that Nur kept out. Then, a Little Birdy confirms the death of the Rose Bar scene, saying:Sadly several friends of mine have been noticing a horrible new trend at Rose in the past few weeks, promoter tables on the real - not like the cool owners or the occasional good promoter mingling, like straight up promoter tables with not like known models but 18 year olds fresh to the city. I was there with regulars last night who actually flipped their shit over it so it's definitely NOT well received by the good patrons who have been loyal for over a year now.So the tables once filled with celebs, artists and the glitterati is now just filled with promoters and model wranglers who are there to set the scene, making Rose Bar a beautiful bar with expensive art and drinks and the same old crowd. Is Ian so wrapped up with his Marriott deal that he has turned his eye away from home base? Since we love Rose's laid back vibe and great scene, we certainly hope not.

With all due respect to the Little Birdy, who cares? Business is business, and obviously the management at Rose Bar wanted those promoters there – it was no fluke that so many models were there the night I described. Perhaps the regulars were feeling the recession, and not as regular as they used to be? By the way, the little incident I described was not at all disruptive of any other patrons there. I just happened to know what was going on, and found it amusing. I have been to Rose many times, with different groups of people – “regulars,” friends I’ve known since childhood, and promoters who bring models (who frequent often, and not just on a Thursday before a long weekend - you probably have never noticed). Whatever the crowd, I have always had a good time. If people just want a good cocktail, and flip the shit who is sitting next to them, they can always go somewhere smaller/quieter like Milk & Honey. If people want to go somewhere with great ambiance and crowd, I’m not sure if a few young models in attendance makes any difference. People new to the city are actually refreshing - they are noticeably lacking in elitist cynicism...=)

promoters now send mass texts for the past couple months at least about hitting up rosebar... And after they go to tenjune. This isn't new. This is months old news. And whats the difference between promoters and Scott lipps or Noah bringing models. These girls won't be regulars, they just want to experience the hot place of he moment but stupid 18 yr old models won't appreciate the place and will never get in without thworbmodel wrangler. Ignore the place on a Thursday. Thad when Ellington isiaih etc all promote there.

You managed to talk about 2 awesome girls, the most popular NYers summer destination and a popular bar all negatively. You wouldn't know if Rachelle is in a share house, bc you can't even get a hotel room in the Hamptons. You are not an authority on who is cool/a-list or anything close. Hint: get a cat, go for a walk, read a book, get a life. No one wants an unhappy, pathetic sloth around who judges people they don't know.

If guest of a guest is so retarded, why are you reading it? Parties that are so exclusive that they are empty? sounds more like, a party you invented in your head. Don't hate on the Hamptons bc you are stuck in the city all summer still sweating even when your AC is blasting and without a beach or bathing suited, sun tanned babe in sight. You don't know Rachelle, so how would you know where she lives.. unless you are stalking her. perhaps you should invite her to your imaginary Rose Bar parties. As for Kerry(who is related to the Mara's who own the Giants,idiot) and Rachelle (who runs GofG and does very well, without putting others down), if they don't matter, you wouldn't know who they were, pretend to know what they do, or bother to utter their names. Talking about them is only getting their name out more, which has obiously in some way made you feel less important. If GofG is so behind the curve, do tell us \"ALIST\" what is cool? How can we be more unfortunate like you? How do we become a nasty person who can only say bad things about others and on the INTERNET no less. Sounds like you were teased in middle school and haven't gotten over the \"poser\" diss. You are a pathetic human being. NO ONE LIKES YOU. At LEAST have the balls to use your real name if your are going to call people out.. o wait, no one would know YOUR name
Stanley Stuyvesant
2008-07-07 21:08:00
Point of Order:If you want to get really technical about what's behind the curve, etc. there is one thing that is for certain, and that is that wherever you are right now (be it the Hamptons, Ibiza, St. Tropez, etc.) NYC is def not ahead of the curve in the summer. Of course all DBTH (aka a-list) can cover is NYC, so he is forced to cover non events, back-date posts that he got scooped on, make silly predictions, and churn out pointless filler so that he doesn't pass into blogger oblivion while he is waiting for the summer doldrums to end. Not passing judgement, just telling it how it is.

They are trying to get people to show up to charity events.. wow they must be the devil. If you don't care about them, look the other way, believe me, they are not worried about you! You can't control what other people say or do, so give it up. Stop hating on people bc they are having fun and living their lives. Ps: it doesn't feel good to have people write bad shit about you, which is why you write under an alias, wouldn't want to have this whole thing turned around on you, grow up. Rachelle isn't endorsing fame game .. you obviously read it anyway!

Never been to most of these places but they do sound better than a night of wacking off. I have been rejected at BI and B8 but been to the Rose Bar a few times (luckily circumstances though). Not actively trying because I'm funky looking but would be nice to see the inside one time which would make it uncool instantly.

I have been to Ibiza and this unfortunately looks like 4 members of their JV squad. Ibiza is a collection of some of the world's most beautiful (but also most burnt out) women I have ever seen. Plus these women most likely will have very dilated pupils in real life, and where are the water bottles?

Above poster is quite accurate. Comparing Ibiza to the Hamptons is quite a reach. Both have their charms, but Ibiza is a beast unto itself that is markedly different from anything we have over here in the states (after all, most people who read this blog would scoff at the notion of a few thousand person club being an enjoyable time...).

Resulted in blood everywhere inside and even some tissue coming out from his head, police on scene, victim taken to local hospital etc. Upstairs may be closed pending investigation into the incident. This one was such a snoozer that it wasn't even worth firing up the weekend Hipster machine. Unlike others who obviously have a pretty open social calendar. But news is news and who are we to keep it from you? We are trying to confirm Upstairs status for their big Monday shimmy.

What: Hotel DelmanoWhere: North 9th and BerryWe made a long needed journey to Hotel Delmano and we sure weren't dissapointed with what we found. Williamsburg's most proper cocktail lounge is beautifully designed, and gives off an effortless feeling of timelessness without pretentiousness that is sorely lacking from so many of these establishments that have recently opened. The subdued vibe certainly wasn't boring, and the music and crowd was quite enjoyable. While the cocktail list was well developed and interesting, we were only interested in one thing. Absinthe. The green stuff is available all over this fair city now, but no one that we know of does it quite like this. Your serve presents you with 4 shots of absinthe and places a large ice water dispenser in the center of your table. On top of each glass is placed a slotted spoon with a lump of sugar. Turn on the spiggot and watch the water slowly drip onto the sugar, dissolving into your drink. When the sugar is gone, you are good to go (don't forget to turn off the water). Almost good to go. Make sure you ask your server for a bottle of wormwood extract for that extra special something. Then it's time to sit back and watch the scene unfold before your eyes. Kudos to Hotel Delmano for going the extra mile for their clientele. We really like this place. Really.

Tonight marks the end of a 2 year run for Minimoo, the sorta secret underground dance party featuring some of the biggest names in the minimal techno music. The party locations were rotated to various spots throughout the city, with attendees not learning of the location until the evening of. Old school. We profiled the place when it was just getting its feet wet, and man was it fun. For tonight's party, Jenny the head moo says so for minimoo's closing party we'll take you far away from canal street's hustle and broadway's bustle and tempt you to a special twist. after all, closing parties should diverge from the ordinary and as such, we have a little surprise for you, a moo cherry on top, so to say! we think that eleven NYC minimoos in this second season and a few exciting moos out of town that featured some of techno world's most inspiring artists is enough of a reason to celebrate, to thank you for your support and to rumble with you one last time before we take a long break in order to focus on minitek.So we wish the whole MM team a heartfelt goodbye as they move on to bigger and better things, and appreciate that they were able to consistently organize wild events that started late, went early, and were a guaranteed blast.

Just one week after Uncle Stevie declared Mansion to a huge success, a Little Birdy dropped a bombshell on us late last night, saying \"A spy says that Mark Baker, formerly of lotus fame, may be departing his current post at Mansion NY and the mega club may replace his services with Joshua Kaiser who runs the pink elephant\". Ka Boom! It certainly would make sense to us, since they dropped mega cash on the space, with a hockneyed plan that we doubted would ever work. But hey, Uncle Stevie said the place is packed with 2800 people every weekend night, and \"mark baker and i had just discussed the projections for the first year and its going great.\" Those must be some projections. At least your pets and gal love you.

Thanks to the ad wizards at PMK/HBH for giving us an afternoon chuckle. They sent out a press release today for Buddha Bar that has us rolling i around in hysterics. Describing BB as \"New York City's premiere restaurant and lounge\", the flacks let us know the Big Buddha is now offering the Gold Digger Cocktail, which is made from 2 oz Gin (Zuidam Gin), ½ oz. Dry Vermouth and Gold Wrapped Olives and Golden Spear designed by Rick Toscano. Sounds like a gin martini. And if that's not enough for you, the entire thing is served in a martini glass! Wowsa! All of this and the amazing ambiance of Buddha Bar can be yours for the low low price of $50. You all make us sick.

Last night was the triumphant reopening of Marquee. Is there a better way to celebrate than hosting a birthday bash for Missy Elliot? Team DBTH was on the scene to cover the biggest night ever, and what did we find? People, lots of people. When we got there, it was a total mob scene outside, with a huge crowd swarming to get in. Not very organized but it was probably first night back jitters. When we got inside, the main floor was a bit empty, but the upstairs was wall to wall. The Misses had about 6 tables roped off for her and her peeps near the DJ booth, with pink balloons everywhere because that how she rolls. Doesn't everyone? Things really picked up around 1 AM. The birthday girl rolled in around that time and the place took off. When we left, there were a few cop cars idling outside, just to make their presence felt. But no one inside really knew or cared. It was Marquee being Marquee, and we wouldn't have it any other way.

This place deserves to be shut down! I haven't been there in ages, thought I give it a try a few weekends ago. The service is rude and arrogant, the food is bad at best and the prices left me gasping for air. 3 starters, 5 entres, a bottle of white and a bottle of red (the cheapest of each), and we ended up with a $1,200 tap. The special of the day was 1/2 dover sole, probably frozen, with champagne sauce - yeah, that justified the price of $75!

Eponymous Cocktails: Freemans Cocktail

***CONTENT
In the second installment of Eponymous Cocktails, we take a walk up Freemans Alley to speak with William Tigertt, co-owner and proprietor of Freemans, and jim Kearnes, who was manning the back bar. Our topic of discussion is the Freemans Cocktail, a permanent fixture on the cocktail menu of this secluded gem. Eponymous Cocktails is brought to you in part by our friends at A Medium Format. If you have an reccomendation or idea for our next installment, please let us know. Did you know that you wanted a drink called the Freeman's Cocktail?No. The drink came first, and then we tried to think of a name. Calling it the Freemans was decided pretty quickly.What is the recipe?• 2 ¼ oz of Jim Beam Rye• ¾ oz fresh lemon juice• 1 dash Fee Brothers Orange Bitters• ¼ oz of simple syrup• 1 bar spoon of Alwadi pomegranate molasses • Flamed orange twistWho invented it?Toby Maloney created the recipe. He worked at Milk and Honey, helped start the cocktail service at the Violet Hour in Chicago, and also helped out at the Rusty Knot.What inspired the drink?When we opened, we were looking for an accessible brown cocktail that worked with our Fall menu. At the time, cocktail menus were dominated by vodka based drinks. We wanted to do a Rye drink, which is really a New York liquor, and wasn't used anywhere. Did you expect it to become a permanent fixture on the menu?Not really, but it became popular and works well across the seasons, so we stuck with it. How often does Freemans change its cocktail menu?It changes seasonally, and we usually try to change it as the kitchen changes it menu. We have a stable roster of drinks that we like to rotate in at the appropriate time of year. I also think we have some of the best bartenders in the City, so if the kitchen happens to come across an interesting ingredient, like a particular fruit, then our bartenders will grab it see what they can do.Freemans stands out as being a true cocktail lounge inside a restaurant. Based on your success here, why do you think other establishments haven't copied your model?When we opened, I originally just wanted to open a bar. When that changed to a restaurant, we still wanted to include the bar inside. But what we do with our cocktail service is a huge commitment in time, money, training and effort. People come to us and hire our bartenders to consult on their new places all the time, and when they find out what it takes to pull it off, they back off. It is not an easy trick to serve a full restaurant and two bars with just two bartenders, but it is working for us.

Quite possibly the worst night of my partying life. I hadn't been to Marquee in a solid 12 months (been frequenting BI, Oak, Cain, Kiss and Fly, etc lately), and to go on such a 'momentous' occasion couldn't have been a poorer choice.Marquee treats you like you're a fucking Jew heading into a cattle car off to a camp. So whoever said that they 'operate so efficiently' in a previous post clearly works the door or list. We got in without a problem, but the whole re-entry bullshit and the MOB of people was disgusting. Furthermore, whoever had the 'great pleasure' to spin for this fat hoe's birthday should never be allowed to drop a beat again. Horrible, HORRIBLE music all night. The crowd was absolutely awful and the new door guys clearly had no idea what they were doing. Just a bad night-- I'll never be back.

UrbanDaddy gets the second official scoop on Bijoux, but thankfully the first press photo, which is seen here. According to the details, UD reports: This club is underground in both senses of the word, so all you'll find out front is an interrogation-room-style, two-way tinted-glass door with a bouncer hiding behind it. If you can entice the door to open, you're in. Just head downstairs, down the kitchen corridor (dodging the Berbere rack of lamb on its way upstairs) and through the door labeled \"private.\" Inside, you'll find a low-ceilinged, mood-lit paradise, complete with a custom-carved ceiling, black-and-gold posters of one owner's wife in the nude and a fog-covered well in the center, in case the journey left you parched. Then again, there's bottle service for that, and a leather banquette in an appropriately shadowy corner that you'll want to seek out with your date later in the evening. As for the clientele, private parties are bringing Jay-Z, Kanye and nightlife marauder Ben Affleck through the kitchen doors, so the guest list may have yet another surprise in store. So effing sexy. But we need to know who designed those tables?

What a crazy weekend in NYC nightlife. Marquee gets shut down, Bijou opens in the MPD, and now First Degree DJ Larceny. According to a Little Birdy, \"Goldbar stole DJ Magnum from a scheduled appearance at 1OAK on Saturday night\". Using our DBTH detective skills, that left 1OAK lacking a DJ for the night. Perish the thought. To make matters worse, Magnum did a great job at Goldbar, with out LB reporting \"the guy KILLED it\". Pouring salt in the wounds. We expect 1OAK to retaliate with a combination of eggs and water balloons by the end of the day. UPDATE: Reps from 1OAK tell us \"You can't steal a DJ that you never hired. Magnum was never booked at 1OAK this weekend.\"

riiight.... because supermodel doutzen is straight from a NJ yearbook.Those who said that probably dont make it close enough to the djbooth at richies table to see. Stuck back by the bar and bathroom stairs entrance?? Yea... well thats when the girls are pretty but not by any of my standards
NYC's decline
2008-06-30 15:39:00
1OAK is probably the most overrated club on earth. yes, a supermodel will come once in a while, but 99% of the girls there are mediocre. get your head out of your ass. it's nothing special: just another hyped up NYC club.
yes

don't get me wrong. it's a nice space. great design, etc.but the crowd.meehhhhhhhhh
ha!
2008-06-30 18:17:00
are we all missing the ridiculousness of this post!? This guy magnum, who im hoping im not mistaken wears very sparkly headphones? he's good, but by no means killed it, DJ sinatra kills it harder than him. and on tuesday that young kid that also spins at gold bar killed one oak.

Seriously i can only imagine this is a pr story by the dj or the club somehow ....how can u seriously kill it in gold bar ...nice place to have drinks but its a bar/lounge not a club ....its like saying he killed it in the lobby of a hotel ....where did people go crazy in there ...in there seats ...think
ha!
2008-07-01 13:30:00
yes thank you.

Many, many months ago, KyKy and Unik leaked their plans to renovate the former Sascha space at 55 Gansevoort and transform it into \" three-part venue that'll include a 24-hour sandwich spot with bakery, a casual Italian bistro, and an exclusive lounge\". Fastforward to today, and Meatpacking visitors will find Merkato 55 (co-owned by Unik) operating in the restaurant space, and not much else. Until now. A Little Birdy paid a visit to the address last night and discovered that the downstairs lounge has finally opened, and our LB has some interesting and positive things to say . . .it's at 55 gansevoort street where sasha bakery used to be. you walk down the stairs and down a corridor sort of like submercer. it's only a little larger than submercer and its a club atmosphere. low ceilings and euro dance music. crowd was sorta euro ish also. bottle service. its the guys from PM that own it. called bijou (sp?) not sure if there is any relation to the one in London. i liked the design of the place kind of a cool looking venue. Just what the MPD needs. But kudos for Kyky and Unik for pulling off this opening without any pre-press. Sorry we had to ruin it. We guess that Submercer now has another small, basement bar battling for underground supremacy.

i was out all day \"pride-ing\" yesterday, and word on the street was the club closings this past weekend (Pacha, Marquee and Splash) were a blatant attack on gay pride week- Pacha in particular had some AMAZING Pride parties plans and will losing big $$ due to this.All the little gay birdies were saying that we can all expect more closures this weekend so the evil NYPD and government can crack down on evil nightclubs and homosexuals all in one fell swooop.discrimination and wasting our cops time when gays are being jumped outside of 1OAK and no one shuts them down.
anonymous
2008-06-30 10:03:00
This was not an attack on pride week, but rather an attack on clubs that stood to benefit immensely from pride week (pacha). as for marquee, this was inevitable- they were busted for employees selling drugs...how can you call that a \"completely clean ship...\" please know the facts before wasting peoples time with inaccuracies.
yes

it's too bad for marquee. they do run a tight ship- possibly the best run club in nyc- ever. not the best club, but the best run. sucks when a few of the staff put everyone in such a compromising position. hurts the owners, other employees and the patrons.

This is a new feature that will highlight our favorite of the comments of the week. Normally, we would sprinkle these around from different posts, but today, we will feature 2 comments from either Uncle Stevie Lewis himself, or someone doing one hell of an impression. Our response is coming Monday. Have a great weekend. they pay their bills, they pack them in and if your at a table with your friends and like that sort of thing its great, and over 2800 people go there every fri and sat and they seem to like it, if its not for you it isnt for you. i dont ever hang there and i didnt design it. life didnt make my top 5 of all time list. the article dealt with mansion gm dirk and the changes that are going to happen to the business of clubs. i dont recommend clubs to people only discuss their business, and as far as writing about myself, i do that, its my blog get your own blog and if you dont like mine dont read it. ill survive. i have thousands of readers who tune in when they stop doing that ill stop writing. why dont you guys write about the stuff that you do on your blog, ill read it, i swear and im sure we can get 10's of others to support... oh yeah i do design a lot of spaces. im working with my partner marc dizon on about 10 right now. i guess people who put heir money where their mouth is are willing to pay me and trust me with their lives. who pays you guys for your creativity and advice? i apologize if sometimes it gets a bit self serving,but just keep repeating these words, its only a blog, its only a blog.. etc.. oh and my gal and pets LOVE me. oops just read that... lots of typo\"s, miss my editor. wanted to add something.. yeah im long winded. mansions financial success is staggering. mark baker and i had just discussed the projections for the first year and its going great. i also want to make clear that i consider 1oak really beautiful and think highbar is amazing, i spent about 2800 words praising david graziano's job at kiss and fly and more on schnabel's rose bar so that statement was silly. i adore dbth, read it all the time. im not trying to do what scott does. i cant. i write about what i know. if derek jeter was talking about himself im sure he would mention the yankees and the world series cause thats what hes known for, life was something i did which gave me some credibility. it wasnt even in my top 10 clubs of all time. anyway have goodnightGoodnight indeed.

Who cares?? Isn't this blog based on nightlife? With all due respect to DBTH, does anyone on this site have half the experience, knowledge, and operational expertise that he has? I have over 13 years of owning and operating clubs/restaurants in NYC, and I find his blog addictive! Look... not everyone rubs everyone the \"right\" way, and unless he's come down on you personally, why the personal attacks? P.S. I can pretty much guarantee you, that I have MUCH more knowledge and background in NYC nightlife then you do!

***CONTENT
Lloyd Grove's interview of Noah Tepperberg in Portfolio a couple of months ago left out one major project on Strategic Group's horizon- Tao Atlantic City. The mega revenue restaurant/dayclub/nightclub will open in the new Revel casino/resort project (above), and will feature about 30,000 sf of Asian fusion restaurant/club madness. There will also be an outdoor area similar to Tao Beach in Las Vegas. But it wouldn't be Strategic if they didn't take Tao just a bit further. It seems that Revel will also have Tao branded rooms in the hotel, which will be located on the top few floors and have a private check-in. No word if the swordfish skewers will be in your room upon arrival. UPDATE: This is just not our week. An update from inside the empire lets DBTH know that this project was discussed a few months ago, but Noah, Jason and the team have no plans to do anything in AC whatsoever. We will now go drown ourselves under the new waterfall.

The Jane Hotel's website went live today, and holy crap, it is a wild scene. There are two room types currently available at the still under construction hotel, and neither is for the faint at heart. Standard Cabins: Reminiscent of a ship's cabin, at approximately 50 sq. ft. our Standard Cabins are remarkably cozy. Each cabin features a single bed, luggage rack, free wireless internet, telephone with voicemail, 23\"-inch LCD television, DVD player, and iPod dock. Please note: All cabins share the communal bathrooms located at the end of the hall on each floor. Captain's Cabins: Our Captain's Cabins feature Queen and King sized beds and are approximately 150 - 250 sq. ft. All of these cabins feature free wireless internet, telephone with voicemail, flat panel television, DVD player, and iPod dock. Please note: All cabins share the communal bathrooms located at the end of the hall on each floor.Note that those communal bathrooms are shared with the current residents, who, you know, live in an SRO building. We're just saying. Anyway, prices start at around $100 a night, and we expect the adventurous, and of course German, tourists to be the first ones in.

Last night, Team DBTH made the journey to Banker Street in Greenpoint to attend the inaugural Studio BBQ, the monthly party on the Studio B rooftop. Good call by us. Upon our arrival at 7:30, we discovered a lengthy line and a shortage of food. Egad. Several line members decided to leave, so we made it quickly inside and found the place to be very crowded. It was a warm summer night, and everyone was enjoying the weather, music and drink specials. $5 for a High Life and Tequila shot is a cure all for the recession blues. The place stayed extremely crowded throughout the night. The organizers made a second food run and with the grill fully stocked, the party people quickly mobbed the cashier to score one of the prized burgers. We passed, but we sure are glad that we made the journey to the B for BBQ.

***CONTENT
What better way for DBTH to celebrate the end of June than on the private roof of the Empire Hotel? Oh wait, there is a better way: throw in a cachaca tasting courtesy Sagatiba, the newest brand of this Brazilian liquor to hit the US. The crowd wasn't mingling too much-too busy getting cozy in the rooftop cabanas with their drinks-but the Sagatiba team was swarming the roof and schmoozing the crowd almost as much as we were swarming the bar. Speaking of the bar, the drinks-from a classic Caipirinha, to a Pomegranate Mojito, to a Bikini Martini and finally, the Empire Cooler-all had fresh fruit (passionfruit, blackberries, the works), and were expertly made. This was no surprise since UK mixologist Jamie Terrell (previously at Absolut & Plymouth) has worked to get this cachaca into places like Milk & Honey and the Gramercy Park Hotel. And the best part? The Sagatiba team claims that they can control the distillation process to filter out the nasty parts of the alcohol that cause a hangover….Considering that this LB remembers that fact despite the amount of cachaca we on last night, this Sagatiba might in fact be a Brazilian miracle booze.

Do you know the names/email/websites for NYC's most prominent nightclubs promoters? I just moved to NYC from Miami so I know how it all works. A friend of mine passed along the number of some promoters but they go to REALLY CHEESY GHETTO places in Chelsea.

Hi...if you lived or your from in Miami and remotely even hang out in some of what Miami considers even \"cool spots\"...you should know the names of the promoters of this city. If you don't, not to sound like an ass, chances are your not getting in.

First, just being HOnest you are an asshole if you have a suggestion then leave it if not shut the fuck up douche.Promoters I know of or personally are Tim Sharp, Alex G, Nima Garos, ENSM events (Reach,Jed), Jordan Harris (bloc group) are all pretty good . I am sure DBTH can give you numbers. Good luck buddy.

I am interested in getting table service etc and just having a great night out geeze.. Last night I actually went to a party for a book launch at 1 Oak but I needs to update my roladex and though this would be the fastest way!

2008-06-25 14:31:00
did you actually just recommend room service? that should be a crime.all the promoters in NY suck these days, or maybe the product they have to offer is bad. For whatever reason, the scene has been weak for the past few months. the good places are the ones with no promo- beatrice, rose bar etc...1oak if ok at best- if everyone didn't look like they were paid to be there it would probably help. Tenjune is ok on a tuesday, but thats about it for clubs with promo.

I found the staff (I don't mean door guy) to be really great super friendly people, and probably got me as many drinks as I bought myself.

To call yourself a promoter these's days is quite scary. Out of the ppl mentioned above i will say they are all decent ppl just trying to make a living. Doesnt mean they have a clue about nightlife or what \"cool\" is. Nightlife in NYC isnt dead its just been covered over by cheesy wanna be's. I dont totally blame the promoters but more the girls that go out with them and the owners that provide a revenue stream to keep this crap a float. Tall skinny sluts from FIT do not equal models! Its so sad that these poor girls have no clue what there sole purpose is, MONEY! if you want to go out in nyc and your attractive then its simple. Walk up to any door and say \"can i come in?\" i will bet my left nut that the door guy will open the rope with ease. On the flip side there are some cool socialites out there that throw sick partys, but you will never find them at TENJUNE, 1OAK, or any other fabricated bullshit. The best partys are the ones that dont have mainstream promoters and are industry based. Some places to visit would be GOLDBAR, THE BOX, SOCIALISTA, MILK AND HONEY, SUB MERCER, SANTOS PARTY HOUSE, STUDIO B (BROOKLYN). try those to start.Hope I was a good help
kato
2008-06-25 14:56:00
Dr. Palms, i agree that most promoters have no idea what's going on and have diluted the quality of NYC nightlife. i think some of the coolest social events, especially during summer, are parties thrown by various firms in fashion, media, PR, entertainment, etc. those usually take place in much smaller lounges, bars, and even apartments. santos party house and studio B are AWFUL. the crowd is mediocre, and the girls are really unattractive. milk and honey is a good spot for drinks if you're on a date, but it's really tiny, and they don't even let guys approach women. what rooftop and hotel bars are good this summer?
patron
2008-06-25 15:04:00
gramercy rooftop is nice place to have a drink and relaxe...great space and good for a small group
Dr.Palms
2008-06-25 15:07:00
Kato,you def hit the nail on the head with studio b and santos as far as quality of the crowds, but every coin has two sides. The amount of dj talent that is booked at studio b in one month is un-real. I would only go to those places for one thing music music music. As far as rooftop partys well were to begin. If your into looking at the same stereo typical crowds night after night then pick any of the usual spots.For rooftop partys that truly kick ass i suggest buying your alcohol, grab your ipod, invite all your \"real\" friends and have a kick ass time on your own rooftop. If you dont have one well mine is always game lol If thats not your thing well i would say Soho house, rooftop ganservoort, and 235th are all pretty chill

2008-06-25 15:09:00
I have to agree with the above regarding the nightlife facade, but unfortunately you have to play the hand your dealt in todays nightlife culture. With regards to the summer sucking in the city, I have to politely disagree. Monday thru Sunday you can walk into any neighborhood pub, mine being Williamsburg hence the name, and find it bustling with young people drinking chatting talking about anything and everything. It is a lot easier to have a great night out with friends in the summer because your local spots are usually bumping. Try Miss Favela for Brazilian food in Williamsburg then walk down the block to Bembe to dance it all off then walk down to the east river after its all done to watch the sunrise. Summer is good here in the city my friends.
kato
2008-06-25 15:13:00
any good bars/lounges in midtown, upper east side, or upper west side? it seems like downtown has been too infested with tourists and B&T this summer. going down below 30th has been painful.
High
2008-06-25 15:20:00
FYI...some dj's that spin at Studio B, also spin at places like Room Service, etc.It also depends on the night. All the fabricated clubs have cool nights. It also depends what your looking for.Do you want to hang out with kids who look like an American Apparel ad..the so called \"hipsters\" of NY? Studio B/ Beatrice InnDo you want people staring at your outfit and hit a glamorous night out- Rose BarDo you want to just go out and dance on a table and spend some money or take shots until you hit the speaker- the fabricated clubs above.Come on peopl-WE HAVE ALL BEEN TO ALL THE ABOVE. I have seen many, many of the same peeps in those places.Also, I do agree-for promoters-its a job and the people joining them want ot be in there with them-we cant hate.When I am drunk with my friends, I can be in Beatrice Inn, Rose bar or 1 oak or poo too oak...I am having a good time and not worried about the person staring or the kid doing high kicks in gold tights.I just want to have a good time and wake up with a hangover!!!

kato
2008-06-25 16:38:00
B&T stands for bridge and tunnel, basically the non-manhattan people who come into the island via bridge or tunnel. most of them are from jersey and long island, and their natural habitat are the meatpacking and chelsea clubs on weekends. the attire for guys is spiked hair with gel of course, and super tight graphic t-shirts from affliction and ed hardy. the female counterpart can be distinguished by a fake tan, excessive makeup, big fake boobs, 5-inch heels, and overly slutty clothes. this crowd has destroyed the once enjoyable clubs of meatpacking district and 27th street in western chelsea.
Cubs will win this year!
2008-06-25 21:42:00
IMO,B&T get a bad rap; 1) at least they like to party hard (dance, take durgs, spend excessive money, try to get laid) 2) at least they're from around here - none of that i moved to brooklyn/w.village after college stuff...

The best parties are the ones where you can come with a few friends and leave with a few new ones. Good promoters should make sure their guests are having a great time and it usually helps to introduce ypurguests to each other. There are plenty of good parties in Manhattan. Find an art gallery or fashion show...grab some drinks there as they are usually sponsored by an alcohol company and find out where the afterparty is being thrown. Most Chelsea \"hotspots\" are B&T, I know because I promote some of them; however, going with one promoter over another can being a world of difference in how much of a good time you will have. My picks of areas with good parties are: LES and both Villages. Le Souk is good on Nondays again...butter I heard was packed on Thursdays as of late... And even Antik is fun for small groups of friends to get a table.

new2nyc - fellow girl/fellow brasilian. here's what i suggest. don't weary skimpy, trashy clothes, the only places that will let you in looking like that are cheesy and awful and you won't want to be there anyway. i'm lucky to have access to nyc's hottest spots, and thankfully not through promoters. my best advice is this: be nice and ask if you can come in for a drink. they're usually only jerks to people that come in with attitude and entitlement and try to argue they way in or name drop or something else equally ridiculous (and by the same, if they say no, say thank you and have a nice night. don't forget the doormen are paid to remember who you are). this has always worked for me. once inside, be friendly, meet people. you'll be suprised how quickly you may get to meet the real people with control over the door and the list...the bar/club's managers, owners and head doormen. i'd also start with a good mon-thurs night rotation. the weekend tends to draw more trashy people so not only can it be easier during the week, the scene is also much better. and if you get to the spot at an earlier time (before 1), you'll have a better shot. and stick to one or two girlfriends...the best spots are small and rolling through with 5 people is always a longshot. good luck. don't be intimidated. it's a fun fun town and go have a good time.

bernie & brady (bsquared) are the nicest, coolest promoters i know. they do a different club on every night, not always the \"newest\" place, but they will make sure that if they invited you, you and all your (female) friends will get in no problem, drink for free and get home safe.as for venues, Highbar is great if you are looking for a chill night. Rose Bar is the best \"image\" place in the city. Marquee is fun if you just want to dance your ass off all night (particularly if you like house music- main floor on Friday nights is ALL Euros!!), If you are from Miami, you probably won't like the LES/Soho joints unless you really didn't like the Miami club scene. as for UWS joints, Empire Hotel roof is the only \"cool\" place you're going to find. Boat Basin is lovely, but certainly not a club. The Box is amazing and unique, but it's not for everyone. Basically if you ENJOY Mansion, you will not enjoy The Box.

Gawker has news of an apparent brawl in 1OAK. Now we know why the cops were called on early Wed. morning to the Meatpacking spot. According to the Gawker report, \"The owners of the club did not seem to care for what happened within their club, and only was concerned that the police was not informed and no press comes out of this, they wanted to retain their public image.\" That screams 1OAK to us. Not only that, one of our commenters said ... \"the mayhem OUTSIDE was due to the fact that someone started a fight with Richie after which they (understandably) shut down the door. a guy with no shirt on (might have been a friend of the fight-starter) was also on the sidewalk raising some kind of hell. door security was super stressed out. the kids that were INSIDE while this was happening had no inkling of anything awry, dancing and drinking were continued without hesitation.\" Sounds like our kind of place. We hope the victims are doing OK, and please everyone, party safe.

Is there yet another player in the Monday night wars? According to Some Notes on Napkins, the answer is YES! La Zarza, the recently opened East Village restaurant and lounge hosted its first Monday night bash, and according to SNoN, it was a hit, saying \"The place was packed with promoters ( some from Tenjune, mansion, etc), modelly girls, even DJ David Morales was there. The spot is beautiful with dark wood, low lights, and surprisingly good house/techno music. The downstairs lounge, which opens after dinner, has only 6 large booth like tables so it will be sure to be exclusive. It reminded me of what a cellar basement at ciprianis downtown would look like. I really liked the party and will certainly be heading back\" It makes us wonder, if every new trend spot is going for exclusivity, doesn't that make them all not exclusive? We will need to consult a higher power on that one. Anyway, good luck to La Zarza as they try to win a Monday following. If it were us, we would probably stake a claim to Tuesday.

I was there. The girls were definitely \"modelly\" and no butter faces. It was a nice crowd, not overly pretentious (it could've been worse), and the music was very good. But to get down to the lounge you had to know someone OR buy a bottle. Doesn't sound \"exclusive\" to me. Let's not bring bottle service to the East Village. Otherwise, recommended.

It was a bit new $, lots of bad fashion. Fuckable girls though, so long as you did not have to talk to them, and the music was on point. Over Under until they close or retool is a year.

First of all I would like to begin by thanking DBTH for their take on La Zarza. Secondly, I would like to clarify that the room had a few industry people and promoters among our guest. That doesn't mean they were working that night. The party is being run by the Partners and Derek&Daniel(glad to have them board).Lastly, I would like to state that for this party we are counting on having it being about the music(Thanks to DJ ORazio Rispo) the energy and based on the size of the room ideally to our guest or guest of guest.

La Zarza is a great option if you can't handle the dirty crowd at Butter ! Gd, I remember when that place USED to be good....I would definately check out La Zarza and with nightlife experts like Roberto Bucheli, Felipe Velloso and Derek & Daniel there is no way this can go wrong !

Last time we checked in with the Mondrian Hotel, an insider had told us that the hotel was close to locking up a deal with a restaurateur and lounge operator. That's all well and good, but what about the actual construction? DBTH decided to get on its giddy up and check things out for themselves. And what we learned was not very much. Half of the hotel is no longer covered in black tarps, but at least from the outside, it seems that we are still many months away from any opening. Stay tuned.

So next weds is my birthday and i am going to have a small dinner with friends, but was wondering where was a good place to go after for dancing, etc. I kind of want more low-key and i don't think we will do bottles, since not many of them will want to drink a lot as we all have work thurs morning. Its all girls - probably about 7 of us, i just want a place for dancing where the door won't be a hassle but still crowded and fun. Do you have any suggestions? OK everyone - please give her some help.

Tenjune Tuesday is its only really decent night but the door is also usually its tightest. If you want to dance and have a low key evening 205 was good a while back, I havent been in months so who knows now. To be honest I am probably going to get ripped on for this but I was invited to go to The Box. I was told it was going to be an excellent show tonight and I would have \"a sick fucking time\",still I will withhold judgement until tomorrow.

I think \"NYC decline\" is still pissed that he walked into his parent's bedroom and his mother was getting ran through by Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen.He let them do it to because they were playing for the coolest city on earth.Patrick Ewing had to wait outside cause he was from NYC and it sucks.

whack information. the mayhem OUTSIDE was due to the fact that someone started a fight with Richie after which they (understandably) shut down the door. a guy with no shirt on (might have been a friend of the fight-starter) was also on the sidewalk raising some kind of hell. door security was super stressed out. the kids that were INSIDE while this was happening had no inkling of anything awry, dancing and drinking were continued without hesitation.

We thought Santos Party House would be the place to dance, not throw down. But whatever happened last night certainly shattered those thoughts. A Little Birdy writes, \"we headed down to Santos to dance off dinner, and I wanted to ask about having some friends there for my birthday when a fight broke out between a bouncer and a reveler, spilling out of the club, knocking down the partitions, on to the street, and causing such mayhem that we had to scramble backwards to gt out of the way and my heel broke (which effectively ended all hopes of dancing).\" Scary. We hope your wings are OK.

i'm not surprised. NYC is a violent city where people are killed by cranes, mowed down by cars on sidewalks, and beaten by club bouncers. there's very few classy or upscale nightlife venues in NYC. the entire city lacks the class, sophistication, and maturity, of a city like Chicago.

A Little Birdy ran into Suk Sung last week and learned some interesting news about Lavo, Strategic Group's newest project in Las Vegas that Sung will be helping oversee. Our LB says,The $20 million supperclub in the Palazzo is going to be divided into two floors. The bottom restaurant portion will be helmed by Ludovic Lefebvre, another LA import, and have a Mediterranean flavour. An adjoining lounge and patio on the strip (with an apparent kick-ass view of the nightly pirate show!) round out the first floor. The second floor is too be the Turkish bathhouse themed club. Think less swarthy half-naked men, moreso lots of water and, in true Tao fashion, wet half-naked girls. The boutique club will be half of the size of Tao, but bigger than the Wynn's Blush(to help throw things into perspective). Right now it's slated to open within the first two weeks of August. It also looks like it'll be the only club opening in the hotel. If Movido's moving in, they haven't told the neighbours. Is it possible we are totally wrong again, and that Sammy Sass has no interest in moving to Vegas? No. No it's not possible. Shame on you for even thinking it.

DBTH pulled double duty last night, also hitting the party for their Diagono men's watch collection at the Frank Gehry-designed IAC building on the West Side Highway. This party was our kind of party from the get-go. Well organized door. DBTH on the VIP- standard. Black rubber Livestrong-style Bulgari wristbands for the VIP bar and watch trying-on station. Open top-shelf bar. Not just any top-shelf bar, but Goose, Chopin and Belvedere on tap (and the house champagne was Veuve). Despite the criticism, the building is amazing. Also in attendance were some little birdies we would have liked to talk to- Amy Sacco (what's up with Bungalow London? Hard Rock Vegas?), Alessandra Balazs (DBTH corporate rates at your dad's new Standard Hotel in Meatpacking?). You know where to find us. The evening wouldn't have been complete without the always obligatory Kristian Laliberte sighting, this time in creepy black slippers that threw us for a loop. Thanks to Bulgari, Syndicate, and of course, Big Barry Diller for a great time.

Fabulous write-up about the party. Interesting you would mention Mr. Laliberte attending the launch. Kristian Laliberte was at the new Bulgari Diaogono launch because Bulgari's new US rep. wants him as the face for \"Bulgari Men\", the new ad campaign that will feature Bulgari's new men's accessory lines. Check out the Bulgari website and all the new belts and bags. Laliberte's face will be all over Men's Vogue, Vanity Fair and GQ advertising them if the rep. has her way. Bulgari is competeing with Cartier and LVMH for more than jewels, watches and handbags. It's their time for men's accessories too. Let's see...I think it will be an amazing campaign with Kristian as the face of BVLGARI.

What do Kirsten Dunst, Andre Balazs, and DBTH all have in common? Give up? They were all throwing down at the Rock and Republic Summer Celebration last night at the Beatrice Inn. Look, we know you are sick of hearing about our nights there, but when you combine James Murphy from LCD Soundsystem and an all night open bar, you know we are going to go. And you know we are going to tell you about. Best part of the night was watching Sia romantically dance with her Tranny Fierce friend. Worst part of the night was when it ended. No gift bags, no rope line, no nothing. Just come on in, have some drinks, and have fun. That's what it's all about! Thanks to Rock and Republic and Radar for the good times.

Not that we know anything about this sort of stuff, but what struck us as funny from yesterday's massive 400 pound, $16 million coke bust in the Bronx was how relatively accurate the cops projects about the value of the product was. Let's break it down:400 pounds = 6400 oz 1 oz = 28 grams6400 oz = 179,200 grams$16 million/179,200 oz = ~$89/gramCall us crazy, but those prices seem about right. Now of course, if you are moving weight, there is no way you are looking to pocket $89 a gram. Do you realize how long that would take? But, to make themselves look good (as of course they deserve to, drugs are a horrible thing and ruin society), the authorities use a street value to hype the size of the bust. In wholesale terms, you are looking at $8-$10 million after this size package. But again, we don't know anything about this.

Hahahahaha this is hilarious. But $89 a gram, that's some good ish. I hate inflation, Ahhhhh you remember those college days when $50 was a lot of money and you were trying to haggle outside your dorm at 4 am. I mean I don't I am just saying.

In Chicago blow costs $12 a gram, its legal, comes directly from the best source in Columbia, and you can do it off girls’ boobs our really cool bars/clubs. Yet another reason New York suck horse nads.

Our LB says, And they robbed that bar closer to 1st on 7th - Blue & Gold (I live right there so I saw the fall out the next morn on my way to work) talked to the bartender last night she said they just got cash - tried to take the TV's but couldn't get them off the wall I guess. Also, they didn't steal any booze... really? possibly this is why I'm not a professional criminal - F' the TV's and lowly monday night bar earnings - booze man, grab the booze! Sounds like a good ol fashion east village crime spree. sons a bitches!Sons of bitches indeed. Where are the Guardian Angels when you need them? Were any other establishments robbed? Do let us know.

NYC's decline

NYC is a crime infested disgusting city. manhattan still has housing projects lying around. and east village is one of the most disgusting urban neighborhoods i've ever seen: just a bunch of rundown apartments, crappy bars, and ugly hipster chicks running around. if you want a clean, livable, safe city, Chicago is the place to be.

B&G's a rad little spot. Owner Mike's a good man. Reads Aqua-Man behind the bar. So there's that.But B&G being robbed isn't the worst happening at that joint in recent weeks. Back in May, after attending a screening of Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Worst Movie Ever, a few friends and I went for drinks at the joint. Bar brawl breaks out. And not just a moderately aggressive dustabout. Ultraviolent type shit. Some bald dude took a beer bottle to another patron's head, then started slinging bar stools across the room. Two of his thug buds started decking everyone in site, including a twentysomething girl (whose boy came to her defense, but got pumelled). Bouncer tried to break everything up, got a glass mug to the noggin.After five minutes the bad guys left -- throwing a sandwich board at the crowd on their way east, toward 1st Ave. Cops came. Ambulances too. Kid with a bloody head was carted out.

NYC's decline STFU. I live in Chicago and I've been to NY many times. Chicago is a great city but it'll never be NY. Spew on all you want about NY's crime but Chicago has 15 kids getting shot to death every day on the south side. The only difference between Chicago and NY is that we isolate the poor and crime to the south side.

2008-06-19 15:05:00
Chi-Town realist, you point is well taken. and i agree that the poor and crime are limited to the south side, which only shows that chicago has successfully completed gentrification. cabrini green has already been torn down and will soon be replaced by condos. the people who are well-off in chicago live in luxury condos and townhomes while most NYC people live in dirty overpriced apartments that belong in calcutta.it's really too bad that NYC still has massive housing projects on manhattan and is not as gentrified as Chicago. NYC has a lot to learn from Chicago.

Now, why can't they rob the new places that caters to the \"New Village People\" like them yuppies and hipsters. If they want to live in the EV, then they should experience the crime that that was (and still is ) there. They're just insulated with their money and the color of their skin.
Chi-Town Realist
2008-06-19 16:16:00
NYC's decline, why would you think gentrification is a great thing? All it succeeds in doing is insulating people from the real problems in their community which leads to complete indifference from the citizens and in turn their elected officials (much like suburbs). Honestly, a little more awareness by people of the problems in their community would be a good thing and might lead to an even better city.Regardless, both cities have their problems. NY just doesn't try to hide it. To take the stance that \"NYC is a crime infested disgusting city\" is just uninformed and antagonistic and to suggest that Chicago is the model for all cities is silly. When Chicago gets to 10-15 million people we'll see how well it handles itself and then compare.
Wait, What?

Funny how New York has nearly three times as many people as Chicago yet comparable raw numbers. Don't get me wrong, Chicago is a great town and morons like NYC's decline are far from reflective of the city's population at large (the Chicagoans I know are all good, decent people) but if you want evidence of urban decay there's a hell of a lot more of it it Chicago than anywhere in the five boroughs. When I visit Chicago I check out the downtown area during the day and high tail it back to gentrified Boystown/Wrigleyville to party at night at the behest of my firends who are locals since even they don't want to be milling about Downtown late at night. It's not like that in New York anymore. The entire island of Manhattan south of the 130s is safe 24/7 nowadays. Chicago's on the right track but it has a long way to go.

DeNiro Pleads Greenwich Hotel's Case

***CONTENT
Yesterday, Robert DeNiro went before the Landmarks Preservation Commission to beg forgiveness for building the Greenwich Hotel with a penthouse that was never approved by LPC. Criminal! Msr. DeNiro didn't offer much of an explanation, testifying that \"We've really worked quite hard on it, and so anything that would be offensive would be offensive to me.\" Everyone knows you worked hard, sir, but your Liberty Bonds also built a top floor that wasn't approved. Historic Districts Council associate Nadezhda Williams testified against retroactively approving the penthouse, saying \"It is larger and closer to the edges of the building, and the roof line is mansard rather than hipped, making it more visible. It makes it appear more residential and fussy than industrial.\" That's what we thought too. We all know how this is going to end. DeNiro and Ira Druckier will study ways to adapt the building and find none that are feasible. The LPC will retroactively approve the design, and the hotel will start booking the penthouse at absurd prices that your average Birdy can't afford. Tear. But that's life in the Big Bad City, and at least Bobby will be happy, because he worked very hard to make sure the Greenwich is \"a place that I want to stay in.\" Pat on the back.

We have Model Behavior to thank for calling attention to the mysterious traffic cone that Kiss and Fly has placed on top of the toilet in their handicapped bathroom. MB reports, I want answers about the cone, which for me, has become one of those quirky clubbing enigmas; an unsolvable mystery. I crave to understand. Did Kiss and Fly, commended for its expensive ambiance - Romanesque arches and fresco painted ceilings - not leave room in its million dollar+ budget for a utilities closet?Apparently said john has been down for 3 weeks with only a cone to show for it. What MB doesn't know is that is a Steve Lewis designed cone, which has helped increase sales by 30% and will be the new standard bearer of handicapped toilets in the hospitality and nightclub industry.

What MB doesn't know is that the toilet actually functions perfectly. Kiss and Fly is using the cone to subtly designate the Handicap bathroom as a \"coke-only\" bathroom, hopefully shortening lines in the regular bathroom for those who really just need to pee.

We all shed a tear this weekend for Lotus, David Rabin's pioneering nightspot in the Meatpacking District, that enjoyed its final night of operation this weekend. Perhaps no one was as sad this commenting Little Birdy, who stopped by this weekend and discovered some sort of secret room, about 8 years too late. Our LB comments: i popped into lotus this weekend, just because i was in the area, felt a bit nostalgic, and wanted to see it one last time. i walked to the upstairs mezzanine and noticed a \"secret room\" of sorts to the right of the bar that i never knew existed. it had a key pad on it, and i noticed that some people (who obviously knew the code) were popping in and out. i stood by the bar for a bit just to get a peek the next time the door opened and some 6 ft model type walked out with a glass of champagne in hand - i looked in and saw a bunch of sofas and tables with candles set up all over.i've never noticed this room before. obviously its monday now and no little birdies will ever be able to check it out as david rabin begins his \"demolition\", but if anyone knows anything, it would be interesting to hear...Perhaps Eugene and Mark will read this and remember to include a room like this for their new project with David. We all can only dream. [Photo Credit]

Perhaps Danny A. is having too much fun celebrating his role in Adam Sandler's new hit film, Don't Mess With the Zohan, to pay attention to what's happening at Ye Olde Upstairs. A Little Birdy was on the scene this weekend and filed this report:1am on Sunday [ED: Monday], one of their regular nights, we count four tables (all occupied by promoters) and less than 25 people. It's a sad state of nyc nightlife when bottle service menus denote which bottles ACTUALLY get sparklers with them. Seriously, guys. And, the least you can do is spell it correctly.There isn't much we can add to that, but we remember how much the Glen Pizzolorusso and Mortgage Boys loved to get their champagne and sparklers back in their heyday. Maybe sparklers sell.

Let's put gross misspellings aside. Less because someone's busy getting their 15 minutes, more because with the rising costs of, well, everything in our fine city, we should feel truly lucky that we are not getting charged for these sprakerlers. By so generously including the sparakerlers in the meager cost of selected bottles, and reminding us that they're doing so (totally using extra Epson ink, btw - respect), they are only pocketing an average of $562.01 on the average bottle of Veuve Yellow Label. And if you are so fortunate to get 2 waitresses carrying sprakalaks in this seasons popular olympic-torch-bearer-meets-agyness-deyn style, that profit plunges to a cool $559.02. Thank god for that promoter who's been frequently \"making it rain\" with stacks of benjis at least once a week there, without that extra income they sweep up I don't know how they'd even get by.

How does Jeremy Shockey like to calm down after fighting with Giants GM Jerry Reese? Head to the local tavern and have a pop or two, just like everyone else. That's apparently what he did this weekend, heading to 1OAK to dance, stare at the Lady Kissing Bull, and get sloshed with a few of his Giants friends. We'll let our Little Birdy paint a pretty picture for you:Went to 1oak where everyone witnessed a completely drunk and stumblin Jeremy Shockey, sunglass wearing Scott Storch, LaVaar Arrington, Tyson Beckford, and some other random athletes....Very good looking crowd, witnessed women and men greasing the doorman on way in...door was supertight, lots of pretty girls left outside....def best looking and most fashionable club of the night.While we're sure this night on the town won't make the Giants brass happy, it's interesting to see how both 1OAK and Kiss and Fly have established themselves as places where the crazy young people want to go. Well, young people and Scott Storch. Good for them.

Philadelphia, once called the Sixth Borough, has long struggled to find anything to brag about compared to it's neighbor to the north, New York City. Now they have something. While NYC's Community Board battle to stop bars from opening, Philly's communities are fighting to shut down group sex clubs. The local NBC has responded to residents complaints about Club Trapeze, a Fishtown club that allows group sex on the premises. Philly's local authorities have shut it down until they can sort out this mess, but CB 1, 2 and 3 take note! Next time you go to reject a liquor license application, you could be dealing with icky orgies.

A Little Birdy stopped by Mad46, the new lounge on top of the Roosevelt Hotel and comes through with a thorough review of the place. Did they have fun? We'll let LB tell you:I must sadly offer up a mixed review. The entrance through the bowels of the north side of the hotel is reminiscent of Highbar, but that's about where the comparison stops. The menu at M46 is pretty extensive -- typical bar/hotel restaurant fare, though we were just there for drinks -- though the drink menu's about on par with the other glut of rooftops opening and slightly less expensive. The space itself is quite a bit longer and narrower, but lacked the cabanas and more private-seeming tables that would lend themselves to bottling up. Bottle service itself, by way of comparison, seemed pretty cheap, coming in around $300 for most. The service was... OK. Our server was fine, but the woman working the south bar could have picked it up a bit. We literally waited fifteen minutes while she chatted up some early twentysomething friends of hers in front of us, took 15 minutes -- no joke -- to make their four drinks while we stood there quietly (with no one else at the bar), waited until after our drinks were made to damage us out (likely worried we'd hear here comping her friends, which she did and we would expect, they being friends), then rang them up and tipped herself out before suddenly remembering our change. Poor form. I'm not sure whether this lady learned to bartend, but it certainly wasn't any club worth going to, apparently. Prediction? This will likely end up another 230 5th-styled crowd for the post-work banker set wanting to stick in the neighborhood (and get off street level at Beer Bar). Nothing too exclusive about the place.We still think $300 for a bottle is a bit of a waste. Buy a handle and sneak it in with you, DBTH style. But we would agree with your thoughts, so many of the rooftop lounges are catering to the same afterwork set, that you could throw them all into a hat, pick one out, and you wouldn't know the difference. That being said, the City needs more spaces like this to allow all those who want to want to drink in the nasty summer air to do so.

Well that was fast. Just one day after we saw workers scurrying about in Serge Becker's new Swiis space on Lafayette, the place done went and opened up. We must point out that it wasn't quite open for the paying public, it had been rented out to host a private event for a Swiss designer. However, we can tell you that it will forever be known as Cafe Select. Boom! And from our photos, it seems that the Rolex clock wound up being hung inside the space, not outside as they do in Switzerland. Crafty. The party goers were served champagne from a marble bar, and the kitchen was not fully up and running as of yet. Giddy mofo up.

Grub Street broke the news that Serge Becker had taken over a space on Lafayette just up the street from his always popping La Esquina. Last night, we just happened to walk past when the gate was up. The space is much smaller than we imagined, but Msr. Becker has been known to make the most of seemingly inhospitable places. So what did we learn from the our little peek in? Not much, but we did spy a gorgeous Rolex clock on the ground which is what hangs outside train stations and other buildings in Switzerland. Dollars to overpriced doughnuts that bad boy will hang over the entrance to this place when it open.

Today, we got a press release from the Fauxcialites, which is the dumbest thing ever created. The release states: Think Lindsay Lohan is the only one who can crash a sold out concert for free? Think again! Last Friday a group of Fauxcialites crashed M.I.A.'s sold out concert. They took over McCarren Pool, became the center of attention and kicked off the Faux Revolution. Fauxcialites are defying the concept of stardom and are prepared to blow your minds with a series of happenings all summer long. Ready to take on the imploding celebrity culture, these media savvy geniuses are crashing the city's hippest spots and bringing a smile to your face. They defy the concept of something. Anyway, apparently they took over M.I.A. with white baloons. We wonder how many fauxcialites it took to come up with this plan. Probably 7. They are looking for help, so go and join their cause if you have nothing else to do. Really nothing else, including cleaning the tub.

BPMW decided to kick off summer by throwing a Ping Pong bash in their own offices. Who are we to argue with that? DBTH rolled in to find the place filled with the mens of fashion, something we know a lot and a little about. The party was crowded, the music was good, the Heineken was flowing, and luckily, the line at the ping pong table was so long that we didn't have to embarass ourselves by playing. DJs Sweatshop Labor and Damon \"Boogie\" Dash held down the decks, and for an office party, place be bumping. Besides the fashion fellas, we also saw an abundance of popsicle consumption (it was hot) and bright plastic visors, one trend we will not follow, no matter what these so called taste makers say. Funniest part, even though it was very guy heavy, the line for the bathroom was still 10 minutes plus. All in all, an excellent was to kick off summer, even though the heat wave was the first sign that the season be a-changing. Thanks BPMW.

While doing our thing at the Big Apple Barbecue Fest last weekend, we heard wild tales of a new brand of spirits selling like hot cakes in the South. It seems that the Firefly Distillery based out of Wadmalaw Island, South Carolina has combined the southern tradition of Sweet Tea with locally produced vodka to create, what else, Firefly Sweet Tea Vodka. From what we were told, the product is so smooth that it requires no mixer, no garnish, and sometimes no glass. It's not available in New York yet, but we have it on good authority that it should be arriving here by the end of the summer.

since when does the government prosecute a person and then state the defendant's defense for them? \"the govt, stipulated that steve saw no monies from drugs and could not reasonably understand the scope. he was only linked to 1 guy and the rest no.\" In federal law, if you are found guilty of being involved in a conspiracy, you are on the hook for the ENTIRE CONSPIRACY. That is why there are so many people fighting the injustices of the disparity on Federal Sentencing Laws. Your make believe account would allow MILLIONS of people that are currently incarcerated to walk free. His case would be CASE LAW (Law of the Land) and anyone convicted of being involved in a drug conspiracy would be able to appeal thanks to your account of Steve (THE RAT) Lewis's case. Your and his lies are easy to pass on the ignorant, not on those that actually READ. \"The anomalous circuit, as is frequently the case on questions of criminal law, was the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which is based in San Francisco and covers nine Western states. The Ninth Circuit ruled in this case that to obtain a conviction under the Federal drug conspiracy statute, the Government had to prove not only the existence of a conspiracy, but that an \"overt act\" to further the conspiracy also took place.But the drug conspiracy law, unlike the general Federal conspiracy statute, does not refer to overt acts. The drug law, which in its current form dates to 1988, provides simply that \"any person who attempts or conspires to commit\" any of a variety of drug crimes is guilty of conspiracy and is subject to the same penalties as those provided for the offense itself. \" UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT.

ur wrong on the law and the facts. depending on the courts perception of the defendants role in the conspiracy a sentence rather than the top sentence is imposed. minor role sentences for instance in the case of a bodega owner who allows people to use his facility rather than actually deals himself places him within the conspiracy but not necessarily the top count.there are many other angles.and still the unanswered question is on who did he rat? when? name a name? why the trial when he could have walked with everyone else? when did he testify or where is he a confidential informant? which case? no reporter and this was covered in depth , ever said that he indeed ratted?many who didnt know him thought he might, but he always said no.look this was 10 years ago whats the beef? your just a hater..the government would have given him a free ride to testify against a guy. p.g. who he didnt like so why didnt he? google sentencing guidelines ,, there are a dozen ways to not get lumped into the overall 10000000000 u speak of. im done with this. i told steve about this , he says \"hi\"
Steven Lewis is a RAT FINK INFORMANT

\"The U.S. Sentencing Commission changed the sentencing guidelines for ecstasy in 1999 after weighing the views of the Justice Department, which supported tougher sentences, and hearing from criminal lawyers and some medical researchers who opposed stiffer penalties on the grounds that they are excessive for a drug that is less dangerous than heroin or cocaine.The new minimum guidelines call for sentences of between 63 months to 78 months for first time offenders.\"And cooperation doesn't have to only include testifying at a trial. He is a rat. Explain how he got a sentence FIVE TIMES LOWER THAN THE MINIMUM!!! He's a rat.

case started in '96 those new rules didnt apply and you didnt answer the question you just asked another question..who did he testify against? which defendant in what case? pretty sure he's the only one who went to jail in the entire case. except for alig who murdered someone. the answer lies in something you touched on which is case law..there was no case law written and thats the answer....? now im really not coming back im going to get into trouble for the hint.. write steve at his blog ask questions and he says he will answer them,

So i am assuming that you are claiming that no one went to trial and beat it (Like P.G) because steve was his typical unbelievable self? It is a FACT that Steve contacted the NY District Attorney's office to cooperate. Fact that he gave sworn statements to the fed's and a fact that the federal commission on sentencing was in 1994!!!

i popped into lotus this weekend, just because i was in the area, felt a bit nostalgic, and wanted to see it one last time.i walked to the upstairs mezzanine and noticed a \"secret room\" of sorts to the right of the bar that i never knew existed. it had a key pad on it, and i noticed that some people (who obviously knew the code) were popping in and out. i stood by the bar for a bit just to get a peek the next time the door opened and some 6 ft model type walked out with a glass of champagne in hand - i looked in and saw a bunch of sofas and tables with candles set up all over.i've never noticed this room before. obviously its monday now and no little birdies will ever be able to check it out as david rabin begins his \"demolition\", but if anyone knows anything, it would be interesting to hear...

Renovations are already underway at the Jane Hotel, Eric Goode and Sean MacPherson's latest hotel projet in the former flop house on Jane and the West Side Highway. But apparetly, plumbers won't be in high demand. This weekend, Msr. Joey Arak had a piece in Page Six the Mag investigating what's what for the Jane and other high profile hotel projects, and broke the news that rooms at the Jane won't have bathrooms en suite. It seems that the interior won't allow for the small rooms to adequately be renovated with bathrooms and still keep it's historic character. Or something to that effect. It will be great to see what the price point is when the renovations will finish, and of course who will want to drop the bucks to get a small room without a bathroom. Probably Germans.

Probably Germans? What the eff is wrong with you? Why don't you apply for a passport and make a trip over to Germany and see for yourself whether or not we have rooms with bathrooms. If you can find Europe / Germany on a map! And while you are over there, why don't you also check if we have telephones and cars!

The rooms are about 6x8. The hotel is still under sro status so the good thing is once you check in you can request permanent residency from day one. You will be sharing the restrooms with the permanent residents.

Summer 2008 may be well underway, but there is still one more piece that is missing from this puzzle. The Chelsea Atlantic City is scheduled to open in late July 2008, and as you may have heard, Paul Sevigny and Matt Abramcyk will be running the show on the Fifth Floor, the hotel's hospitality and nightlife space. Now that the opening is a month or so away, we are starting to learn a bit more of what the Beatrice Boys have planned. The Fifth Floor will feature the Terrace, the Bar, the Game Room, the Living Room and a 15,000 SF rooftop swimming pool area featuring private cabanas and a full-service bar. Pretty self explanatory, right? Right. But don't expect to find a Beatrice Inn South. This is traditional AC all the way. According to Abramcyk, the goal is to recreate the classic Atlantic City vibe, saying \"the 5th Floor at the Chelsea will infuse Atlantic City with stylish yet nostalgic nightlife similar to that of its heyday.\" We are hoping they consider the 50's and not the 90's the heyday, but to each their own.

They've put Chelsea on the nightlife map. They've established the most consistent spot in the Hamptons, and their restaurant, nightclub and day club in Las Vegas generates the most revenue of any hospitality operation by far. And they are opening another Vegas mega spot right next door. So what's next for Noah Tepperberg and Jason Strauss? Ibiza? London? Beijing? Murray Hill? If you guessed Murray Hill, you would be absolutely right. A Little Birdy spills the birdy beans, saying \"New Strategic Group project in Manhattan will be an event space/restaurant/small lounge to be located in the 30's on the east side. Is Murray Hill the new meatpacking?\" With the tightening of liquor licenses and high downtown rents, people in the know look for opportunities on the fringes, and while there are plenty of fake Irish pubs in the area, there are no high end nightlife spots. Like we've said before, a risky bet, but we aren't betting against these guys. UPDATE: A rep for Noah and Jason denies any plans for this space, saying \" They have no current plans for any space in midtown.\" Now we will cry over our apparent inaccuracies and beat the feathers out of our birdy.

You are going to see a boatload of coverage today from this weekend's Big Apple Barbecue fest. All of it will be from the outside looking in. Only here will you find coverage from the inside out, as DBTH took the weekend off to work for The Pit, whole hog master Ed Mitchell's Raleigh, North Carolina restaurant. We showed up for work at 9 AM on Saturday morning. The Pit had been segregated on the outpost of 26th and 5th Ave, away from the main area on Madison. At first, this seemed to be a poor location, but it would prove to be a strategic move. There were five cookers already going, fueled only by Kingsford charcoal. Inside each cooker was at 1 whole Carolina hog, with an average weight of 150 pounds. The hogs had been placed on the cooker at around midnight, and each was flipped twice. 3 had already been cooked and were resting in a warmer at the end of the line, and the rest were just about ready to come off. That's where the fun began. Our role was to grab each whole hog off the cooker and bring it to the chopping station. Once there, we would disassemble the pig, removing the shoulder, loin, bacon and butt and all the juicy bits in between, throw it onto the chopping block, where two choppers would chop it up. Ribs would be thrown into the rib bucket, feet and others bones were tossed in the garbage, and skins would be saved for crackling. Once all of the meat was chopped, it was placed back on the stripping surface for \"seasoning\". The recipe is top secret, but helps give the meat a sweet, salty, spicy taste that perfectly accentuates the whole hog meat. We worked for 2 days in the sweltering heat, helping serve approximately 18 hogs, with some additional shoulders cooked to please the crowd. The booth was once again the most popular, with lines forming at 11:15 each morning and enough customers each day that the Pit ran out of food by 4:30 each day. It seemed everyone wanted at least one taste of the Mitchell meat, and wanted to thank the man for coming to the City to share his southern love. An amazing sight to behold. By the end, we had stripped, chopped and seasoned so much pig that we are making the next two weeks meat free. But Ed, Aubry, Ryan and Reggie made us feel like part of the Pit team, and this once in a lifetime experience is something we will never forget.

We have several dedicated Little Birdies who love to feed us tips, which in turn we share with you. Today we bring you a Monday edition of Birdie Wars, in which two Little Birdies independently go to the same place and come away with two completely different opinions. Today's venue is Highbar, Greg Brier's new rooftop lounge and grill on 48th Street.Little Birdie #1: talk about a real shitshow....was at highbar fri nite, was first told guest list only as it was only me and another guy, then when recognized by another door guy we were beckoned in and given a tour. On way up, we were told by staff that its full of nyc models tonite. Ok, lets see. Every 3rd table was a slimy promoter with a table of underage waifs too scared to leave his side. Lots of freeloaders there admiring them. Very little bar business. Place is mostly covered and doesnt have the feel of a 230 5th. Little Birdie #2: I love love love HighBar. It is my new favorite place to get drinks after work. You have to come up and meet me for drinks there soon, that's how good it is. LB #2 seems to frequent HighBar immediately after work during the neighborhood's peak hours, while LB #1 seems to have shown up on a Friday night looking for some hot hot fun. Always risky to do that on a summer Friday, especially in midtown. We have to say LB #2 is the winner of this war, and we are calling HighBar this summer's after work hot spot. Show up after 11 at your own risk.View from HighBar - Credit

I'm falling somewhere in the middle here. We made Highbar our first stop the weekend before last en route to the Knot and Upstairs, among other spots, and the crowd was... OK. Not a lot of talent, sadly, though admittedly it was a holiday weekend and the Hamptons (where we were supposed to be before work popped up) were likely killing it. I agree with #1 that it's kinda lacking the (yes, fairly douchey) vibe that makes 230 fun sometimes -- the view's not spectacular, it's pretty small, and we don't yet have any friends who work there. That said, as Midtown post-work spots go it's hard to beat. Friendly (attractive) staff, good drinks, and -- thank God -- something other than the Bryant Park/Cellar/Koi/Utah's happy hour scenes. We will be returning...

why is it so hard to find attractive girls in this city? the talent is so lacking. you would think the biggest city in the country would have some talent at the clubs and bars. can't wait to move to Los Angeles, a city that is overflowing with beautiful women. and you don't even have to go to an exclusive club to see them.

Last night, S Magazine decided to throw themselves a little afterparty shindig at Santos Party House, Andrew W.K.'s long in the making dance-a-teria at 100 Lafayette Street in Lower Manhattan. The space just opened in the last few weeks, and the space has quickly become the spot in the City to really throw down. S had none other than Dash Snow and The Henry manning the DJ booth, and by the time we rolled in at 11:30, the party was in full effect. The space was packed with a very now and talent filled crowd, the only place besides Beatrice to really bring the Brooklyn vibe across the bridge.We were very impressed with the space, more for what isn't there than what is. It's sparse design allows for more people to do what they want to do; let loose and dance. Plus, you've got to love any of the now nightspot that serves draft beer. We took our leave aound 1:45 last night, definitely on the early side since the place was still packed, and when we go outside had a smile across our face. The reason? We liked that place. We really liked it. And we had fun. What a refreshing feeling.

New domain, new series. We are pleased to bring you the first installment of Eponymous Cocktails, a series that takes you behind the bar to get the story behind your favorite bar and restaraunts signature cocktail. Our first stop was Back Forty, Peter Hoffman's casual East Village restaurant and bar, where we chatted with bar manager Michael Cecconi to get the full lowdown on their house drink. If you have a suggestion for the series, please do let us know. Photos courtesy of A Medium Format What role does the cocktail service play at Back Forty?Peter Hoffman and his restaurants are so much about local, fresh ingredients. So the cocktail service is really about finding fresh ingredients and liquefying them. Overall, the cocktail service is really trying to be an extension of the food, and an expression of the ingredients we use. What were you looking for in a house cocktail?Again, the restaurant is about local products, so we wanted to do the same with the Back Forty cocktail. We knew right away that we were going to do a whiskey based drink, and we wanted it to be clean, easy to make, and most importantly, something that worked across seasons. We rotate the cocktail menu, but the Back Forty will always be available.So, what's in the Back Forty?It's born out of the classic Sidecar and the Whiskey sour. We take 2 parts whiskey and two parts of the sweet and sour mix, which is 1 part Vermont maple syrup and 1 part lemon juice. A few dashes of Fee Brother's Orange Bitters, another great local product, shaken, and served over ice.What kind of whiskey do you use?We use George Dickel - the other Tennessee whiskey. It's very popular in the Southeast, but not served very much here. The flavor profile is similar to Jack Daniels, but there is something about it that just blends so well with the maple and sour. It's a little difficult to get in the City, but we buy in bulk and always have an extra case on hand.Is there any garnish?No. A garnish really should only be there to add a missing element. This drink is good as is.Most importantly, is the drink popular?It's definitely our most popular cocktail. We probably sell 3 Back Forty's for every one of everything else. What do you think about it?Delicious!Glad you like it. Photos courtesy of A Medium Format

I was there last night and after too many Jamesons at pre bbq party then vodka/OJ's at the actual club I professed my love to Whitney Port. They were as most celebrities tend to be a bit secluded on the upper banquet with cameras hovering around them. I don't know how it could be fun to party when a camera light is on you for so many hours at a time but they looked happy, vapid but beautiful. I on the other hand left stumbling with broken glasses in hand and no dignity intact. Just anothert amazing night at the Upstairs.

Hot off the Birdy wire, DBTH has learned that Danny A., promoter extraordinaire, Upstairs maven, and all around good guy, is slated to take his A list game uptown to the recently opened Plaza Hotel. And the fun begins this Friday! Let's let our Little Birdy Explain: \"Danny A. and Sufi are starting promotional direction of the newly renovated space in the Plaza…on the super hush as their probably not doing a hard launch until end of summer as to not compete with the Hamptons stee…but this Friday will be a great scene…Jesse Marco spinning (Goldbar & OAK resident). Their goal with Plaza space is super super high end, very small room and will be treated like a Rose Bar.\"A bit more research leads us to believe that Danny A. and his team will be handling events at the recently renovated Oak Room and Bar, which was the spot when the Plaza represented all that was great and opulent about New York City. But will it draw the downtown crowd uptown? We aren't betting against Danny A., so the answer apparently is yes. Yes it will.[Photo Credit]

We love great photos, so we really loved these action shots a Little Birdy sent in, saying, \"I was at the Beatrice Inn last week around 11:30. The downstairs was pretty crowded, so we headed to the back which was still relatively quiet. My friend and I grabbed a seat and were chatting when out of nowhere, this golden fire cracker appeared. She immediately jumped on a table and started gyrating wildly while the other 20 people back there looked on. She then hopped down and started doing Rockettes styled kicks to some standard 80's dance music. Her spastic movements didn't really inspire anyone to join, and she left before the place got crowded.\" Thanks LB. These pics kind of jealous that we weren't there to witness this display. Kind of.

The thing about the New York City Landmarks Commission is, they sure are sticklers for the rules regarding their Historic Districts. And they hate when developers lie. A report in the Daily News says the LC has told Robert DeNiro and his partners that the penthouse of his Greenwich Hotel is illgeal, and it just may have to come down. D'oh! The dispute touches on the 7th floor addition, which was approved in 2004 but currently \"is steeper and its footprint bigger, making it significantly more visible [from the street] than originally allowed.\" So what's the remedy? Well, the whole floor may have to come down, which is within the Landmark's Commission rights to order. This would prove to be a disaster for the hotel, which took several years to build, was partly financed by Liberty Bonds, and is relying on the intricately designed penthouse to act as a real cash cow. There has been no decision yet, but a meeting has been scheduled for June 17. Stay tuned.

Yesterday, the NY Times pontificated on the current boom in boutique hotels, saying that with the successes of Schrager, Thompson, and the W Hotel chain, the days of the boring Marriott, Sheraton and Hilton opening in major and minor metropolitan centers are over. Now these chains and mega corps have drunk the Kool Aid, with every one of them looking to cash into the cool cachet of a hotel with small rooms, flat screen tvs, iPod docks and a not so trendy bar in the lobby. But what does that mean for you, the average DBTConsumer? We asked our resident Hotel Guru to get their opinion on the article, the industry, and where we go from here.According to the HG, the Times is \"pretty much on point with trends that I have seen developing since the late 90's and now the bigger hotel corps have caught on. . .People's tastes have improved, whereas they used to be comfortable in a cookie cutter property now there is a greater appreciation for good aesthetic and ergonomic design. Not exactly sure what to attribute it to, but the market is definitely more discerning and is now willing to pay for it. (although the downturn in the economy will likely impact a lot of the upper end \"boutique\" properties around the country. NYC seems to be immune though based upon the influx of int'l travelers) The fact that there are now \"boutique brands\" across multiple price levels means that rather than designing and constructing with quality materials (like the Greenwhich hotel) places like Indigo are going for Cheap Chic which tends to be very timely and likely to go out of style soon and will require a redesign in the near future. To me this doesn't facitlitate the lasting relationship that I think a hotel should strive to achieve with its guest. If the hotel is changing every three years than where is the sense of calm and familiarity each time a guest returns. I think the great hotels of the world are the ones that are timeless and will remain relevant regardless of the styles of the times. That said, in this day and age they should offer all of the modern conveniences that create a comfortable and productive environment for guests.As for poor service, I think so much of that is attributable to the owner/operator and not the fact that the hotel is well designed. I think what has led to a problem with a lot of Independent Boutique hotels is that it became fashionable to open a hotel and often times the owners were inexperienced and not able to execute on all levels. In time they will improve as they gain experience, in some cases the trendy factor can overcome the problems (ie Gansevoort) and other times in cannot (ie Dylan Hotel).We couldn't have said it much better ourselves. Quality hotel are much more than just name brand amenities, and like so many other things, the followers are often just looking to capitalize on a trend they are 5 years behind on. Your best bet is to continue spending your hard earn dollars with companies that have earned them, by providing service and a bang for the buck. And don't let the boutique hit you on the way out.

We would like to take a minute to mourn the passing of Alton Kelley, a pioneering spirit of the San Francisco scene of the mid 1960's. Along with partner Stanley Mouse, Kelley created legendary poster art for legendary artists who were starting out in Northern California at the time. Perhaps even more importantly, Kelley was a founding member of the Family Dog, the group that organized the first Acid Tests in San Francisco in 1965. So what does this have to do with NYC nightlife. Well, just about everything, as the parties that Kelley organized in San Francisco helped shape the way that events and nightlife are run to this day, and who knows what things would be like if these freaks didn't host their acid fueled freak outs in abandoned dance halls way back when. Pour one out for him tonight.

Does it ever hurt to have a celebrity show up at your Hamptons nightclub? Debatable. However, we think that if Terrell Owens, the moody wide receiver from the Dallas Cowboys shows up, we would try to keep it quiet. Newsday's Hanging in the Hamptons site got word that TO flew into the East End and went right to Lily Pond to meet up with friends. We smell something fishy though, because it seems like this guy has no friends. Oh well - that's the Hamptons.

Lilly Pond is busy but kinda like a college party. It's really young in there. The space looks a lot nicer then its previous incarnations. After checking it out 2 of the first three weekends I would still suggest Pink Elephant. It hasn't been as crazy busy this year but the crowd has been the best that I have seen in the hamptons thus far.

Last night, the good folks from Campari and Radar Online hosted an evening with burlesque and most importantly, delicious Campari cocktails at a converted event space in Soho. When we arrived, the space was crowded, the room was hot, and the cocktails were flowing. Mixologists from Southern Hospitality, Death and Co., Employees Only, and Elletaria were on hand to create the menu, and they all hit it out of the park. Our favorites were a watermelon cooler with Campari and Gin and a Campari and cherry juice concoction that were super refreshing on a warm late spring evening.It's never easy to do quantity cocktails for so many people and keep the quality level high, so we take our hats off to all the mixologists for knocking this one out of the park. The Campari house will continue to host periodic events throughout the summer, and you can bet your sweet ass that your friends at DBTH will be RSVP'ing every damn time.

What happens when a big, fancy developer opens a new hotel down the street from you and has the audacity to steal your name? That's the predicament that the Chelsea Pub and Hotel found itself in when the casino-less resort was dubbed the Chelsea Hotel. So the original Chelsea Hotel hired themselves Hotel Internet Strategies to rebrand themselves, lest anyone be confused. HIS has suceeded and let us know about it, saying \"just wanted to inform you that The Chelsea Pub and Hotel is now the Chelsea Pub and Inn\". Genius! Please note this down so you don't get confused making reservations this summer.

You can put up all the signs you want. Drinkers still love to smoke, and they love to do both at the same time. So despite the smoking ban that Mayor Mike passed in 2002, some places still turn the other cheek when their patrons light up. But can the state use a tax increase to do what the City couldn't? We are about to find out, because \"on Tuesday, the state tax on cigarettes will rise by $1.25 a pack - to $2.75 from $1.50 - driving up the cost of a typical pack in New York City to around $8.50.\" That is also the cost of one Manhattan beer (when you factor in tip). You have to think that while the die hards and casual smokers will smoke no matter what, this may help some in the middle decrease their habit, and that may just make your favorite nightlife spots even that less smoky.

Finally - hopefully soon it will be up to $20. Though I have heard convincing arguments that smoking is actually good because smokers die sooner and thus actually cost less in healthcare. Oh well.$8.50 a beer? The bars I'm at 90% of the are still $5, $6 max.

Our first few trips back to the recently re-opened subMercer have been pretty positive. Division Street, a seemingly brand new brahg, has also gone and has come up with a handy list of pros and cons, which we would love to share with you.Pros of Submercer:* No reception = no drunk dialing/texting. Saving us all from sending this text: \"out at submrcer, but woud rather be with u”…to more people than we’d like to admit.* \"You called me? Are you sure? I was at submercer, the reception there sucks. Sorry. Maybe we’ll hang out next weekend!?\"* Bomb scare? I know where I’ll be. Cons of Submercer:* No one can really meet you there on a whim. It has to be planned and finalized before going under. Like marriage.* Rolling out around 3:19am and receiving these 3 messages from New Crush: “Hey” 12:58am “Still want to hang out? Would love to see you!” 1:39am “Ok. I guess you’re not into it. Call me never.” 3:18am Curses! You were THISCLOSE to sealing the deal…* The ceilings are about 3 inches lower than Beatrice. Which is officially too low. Models: get ready to put “the slouch” to use. The verdict: Great for parties, nice change of scenery, and by the time you make 5 lefts and 3 rights and another left before getting in, you'll feel like James Bond.Cheeky Division Street. We'll be watching you.[Photo by Phillip Angert]

Donald Trump is the greatest real estate developer and casino operator in the entire world. Hell, he is the greatest person ever. Fact. So what happens when the Trumpster built his fabulous Trump Marina Hotel Casino in fabulous Atlantic City. Well, not so much. Apparently, King Donald has sold the property to Coastal Marina LLC, an affiliate of Coastal Development LLC, for the bargain basement price of $316 million. But here is the kicker - they are turning it into a Margaritaville! As in Jimmy Buffet's Margaritaville, the biggest kick in the groin a resort town trying to re brand itself could ask for. And as our Little Birdy points out, \"they're trying to market that chelsea hotel there as the AC hipster property, right? but any hipster worth his salt (heh!) would choose to go to margaritaville for purposes of irony.\" 100% correct. Stay classy Atlantic City.. Trump Marina sells for $316M, turns into Margaritaville [Crains]

Name: AntikAddress: 356 Bowery, NYCStatus: Ous'tDon't tell us you're shocked. While this place seems to consistently attract a crowd, it's Antik's operation that has branded it officially Ou'st. We aren't sure what ad wizards decided to open a lounge without a bar, but it is one of the worst concepts we have ever seen. Because of the weird operation, most people make a bee line for the basement bar King's Cross, which when we went was staffed by one bartender, totally overwhelmed by a normal size crowd attempting to order drinks in a room that had no air conditioning. Impossible. So it's back back upstairs to Antik, only to remember that there is no easy way to order drinks there. So in that situation, what else can you do but leave without ordering anything? To add insult to Antikury, a Little Birdy lets us know that he was threatened by the Antik doorman 45 feet from the entrance, saying \"I walked out Antik because it was so terrible, and the doorman was busy talking to girls rather than manning the rope. I just walked around it and he told me that I have to wait for him to let me out. I told him that he should relax, and he started yelling at me for no reason. After walking down the street, the guy wouldn't shut up, and wound up running after me to get in my face, threatening me. What kind of bullshit are they running? Place is a joke\"Customers that can't get a drink, no air conditioning, and door men that threaten people is a losing combination. Antik is officially Ous't.

The upstairs of Antik doesnt have a full service bar becuase it is designed for people reserving tables. The downstairs of Antik or Kings Crossing has a full bar and booths for people who prefer more of a bar environment. The Doorman during the week is this raspy voice guy who is usually really nice and the place is a good alternative to beatrice if you dont want to make the trek across town.

I can understand a bad club experience will always leave a sour taste in your mouth. For every negative there must be a positive. I can't speak for every night at Antik and definitly can't disagree with your John Schwartz comment. Friday nights at Antik has a proper line up, The Agency NYC, Alex Pal, Maurice and LB cast a great crowd. Upstairs you can get drinks since there is a cocktail waitress and service bar. To make a long story short swing by Friday and give the space another chance!

Went to a PRIVATE PARTY here tonight and my girl and I were having nothing but pure fun, but when she pulled my shirt up 1 or 2 times, some mamsy-pamsy claiming to be the owner scrambled over and reprimanded us like a conservative old grandma. When we quit that and engaged in some totally faux, FUN lap dancing - with ALL OUR CLOTHES ON, he skipped back over in a tizzy and got hysterical again. From there, he proceeded to fire up a cigarette along with the cancer sticks of his various eurotrash cronies which ran everyone out of the place. Later we met the DJ outside who mentioned how he noticed we were having a blast all night and enjoyed our dancing. In spite of that, we would never, EVER set foot in this place again, which had the atmosphere of a conservative church social. F-Minus!

Some sad news to report. Racked has learned that LeNell's, perhaps the finest liquor store in New York and a Red Hook staple if there ever was one, has lost their lease and may have no where to go. According to Tanya \"LeNell\" Smothers herself: Our lease is officially up this month. I know it will take months for a formal eviction should it come to that. Sad to say that the space that we had a draft lease for fell through this week.Tragedy. There seems to be no other options in the area, and no other part of Brooklyn will suffice. The only possible rainbow in this vast real estate storm is that LeNell's may be willing to consider Manhattan if no Red Hook space materializes.

A lot haters tried to throw cold water on the opening weekend of the Surf Lodge, the rehabbed waterfront property in Montauk. But it seems that the opening weekend couldn't have gone any smoother. According to a Surf Lodge insider:It was so crowded. I don't think montauk has seen so many people before. All elements of the property (the hotel, the deck, the bar, the restaurant) were running at full capacity. The on-site Tracy Feith boutique opens this week. There were many locals, industry types, and celebs in attendance. Many for multiple nights in row. And everybody was raving about Sam talbot's food.What everybody needs to realize is that this is not a nightclub and to not compare it to those other places. Its a chill spot, open seven days a week. If someone's first thought is \"Montauk?\" Then its probably not for them.These pictures sure look like they are telling the truth. Check out that sky behind Julian Marley! Like co-owner Jayma Cardosa said, Montauk is just a bit different, and they don't expect a Dune type scene. Different strokes for different folks. Early congratulations all around. [Photo Credit]

We sent our most trusted correspondent Nicolette from Nicolette and the City out east for the weekend to have a little looksee at some Hamptons night spots. On Saturday night, she checked out Lily Pond and lived to tell the details.Summer 2008 started off with a wild Saturday night at Lilly Pond. We arrived at 11 and the valet was already full, with a crowd of at least 60 people trying to argue their way into the club. After finally finding parking on some side street, I walked along the side of the road in four inch heels back to the club. When we arrived, there were now about 100 people trying to fight their way in. Great. It was chaotic but about twenty minutes later we finally made it in with a little help from Kristian Laliberte, one of my hosts for the evening. Once we got in we headed over to the Unruly Heir table, where UH creator Joey Goodwin and Kristian were holding court. They were there celebrating an event they held earlier in the day at Blue and Cream in East Hampton. Hanging next to their table was Whitney from The Hills and there was also a special performance by Estelle (unfortunately sans Kanye West), followed by DJ Berrie, who played mostly house with some random mixes of rock. The place was pretty small and insanely crowded; there were white and navy striped couches that served as bottle service areas in the middle of the “dance floor.” There were also banquettes along the side of the wall that served as posts for bottle service. There was an elevated stage at the back end of the club which had a few tables (ours and Whitney Port’s), which doubled as the stage and DJ booth. The crowd was all twenty something’s that consisted of trendy Manhattan goers, a few socialites and models – think Tenjune on a Tuesday night except with all house music. There was one bar at the entrance of the club, which was impossible to get to and it took about twenty minutes to get a drink. Bottle service was a little slow here – they could use a little bit more staff, but I forgave them since it was Memorial Day Weekend. By 2:00 a.m. everyone was more than intoxicated and the place started to clear out. Overall, Lilly Pond went beyond my expectations. I didn’t expect this place to be anything great and I didn’t think anyone would show up – let alone Whitney Port (although she isn’t quite A-list) or a performance by Estelle. The party had everything you wanted - great music, booze, hot people, a few “celebrity” sightings and it wasn’t that far from their competition down in Southampton (on the way back we were by Pink Elephant 12 minutes after leaving Lilly Pond). I will definitely be going back.

The Page gets in on the Monday Night debate, detailing the feux fued between Butter and Bar Martignetti's Monday night parties. The Sixers state:Bar Martignetti on Broome Street, which takes a dig at how celebrity-infested Butter's bashes are, hosted its first one last week. \"Imitation is the most sincere form of flattery, but after five years it is clear that everyone prefers the real thing. All Butter alternative products should remain on the shelf,\" quipped Akiva. Bar Martignetti owner Anthony Martignetti replied with, \"Our party is a lot more fun.\"Maybe they can settle this with a butter fight - where they all lather each other with butter and fake butter and wrestle on Lafayette. Who wouldn't watch that?

As you and your share house friends prepare for your big weekend night out, we suggest your first check your bank accounts before you agree to go in for a table at one of Suffolk county's summer hot spots. And why is that? Because a table is going to cost you. According to a Little Birdy, \"Hamptons folks seem to have colluded to all charge $2k a table at Lily Pond, Pink and Dune....and they're going fast as per a host friend of mine.\" Of course they are going fast, since people want to lock in at this low price before the summer gang of 3 jacks it to $2500. But imagine how cool you will feel when all of those other losers have to stand all night watching you and your friends sitting at your table. Now you see.Photo Credit

Glen Pizzolorusso became a mortgage banker straight out of college, right when the housing market was exploding with ARM's and sub prime loans that were making many people temporarily rich. So how did he spend his money? By balling in New York City of course. In this clip, we hear Glen's heartwarming tale of living the high life, spending nights dropping thousands of dollars at Marquee with his friends. Now we bet you are wondering - what does all of this really have to do with nightlife? Well, everything. You see, people like Glen fell ass backwards into jobs that paid him close to $75k a month for a job that any monkey could do. And when the monkey got paid, he decided to throw it around in nightclubs, which helped make others very rich. And now that monkey money is gone - but the successful clubs have paid a price. Some have seen declining business, others have dealt with rising rents they can't afford to pay anymore. Just proves that this credit crisis has an impact everywhere, in ways many haven't imagined.

NYC nightlife is such a freaking joke. it's filled with finance dorks who drop cash, thinking they're cool and ugly girls who think they're hot because they're wearing $5,000 handbags. when it comes to fun and quality of women, chicago, LA, and Miami, are all far superior. NYC is a declining dirty third-tier city.

Money's great. But everyone knows that where NYC nightlife is at is the places that you really have to be in the know to get to. Underground parties, lofts in Brooklyn, restaurants that shut the doors and draw the blinds closed after midnight. Better music, better crowd, no bullshit, no $15 drinks. Hell, I have more fun at east village roof parties than I do at Marquee.The big clubs are businesses; that Goodnight Mr. Steve blog or whatever it is evidence of that. Those interviews with the douchbag club owners/promoters who talk about their \"brand value\" and the \"global services they can provide their clients\" make me want to vomit.I'm SO happy I've never had the desire to drop even $50 on my share of a bottle, let alone thousands to get in these place - once every few months when a friend is having a party or there's some event I'm on the list for is good enough for me.So is NYC in decline? Maybe, if you think these places are all there is. Live here for awhile, build a network, get to know where the cool parties are. There's still no city with energy like New York.

LOL! rooftop parties are such a joke, especially compared to the outdoor partying in L.A. and Miami, cities that have smoking hot chicks and an amazing nightlife. Chicago is pretty good too, definitely better than NYC.for those of you making fun of chicago, you definitely have never been there. the city is light years ahead of NYC in every way, and it's actually clean and livable.

The War on Drugs has often been used to suppress music and lifestyles disliked by the political establishment. Local, state, and federal drug laws give the government enormous power and this power has been used to exert control over emerging subcultures. Jazz in the 1940s. Rock and roll in the 1960s. Heavy metal and rap in the 1980s. Electronic music and Hip Hop today.The RAVE Act which threatens to squash live music and free speech was passed in 2003 when it was tacked onto an unrelated child protection bill. In 2004 there were two additional pieces of legislation considered - the CLEAN-UP Act and the Ecstasy Awareness Act - that threatened to widen the laws to prosecute anyone who holds an event and fails to prevent illicit drug use.Senator Joe Biden (D-DE) forced the controversial legislation commonly known as the \"RAVE\" Act through both houses of Congress as an attachment to an unrelated child abduction bill.

In 2004 there were two additional pieces of legislation considered - the CLEAN-UP Act and the Ecstasy Awareness Act - that threatened to widen the laws to prosecute anyone who holds an event and fails to prevent illicit drug use.Senator Joe Biden (D-DE) forced the controversial legislation commonly known as the \"RAVE\" Act through both houses of Congress as an attachment to an unrelated child abduction bill. The \"RAVE\" Act, also referred to as the Illicit Drug Anti-Proliferation Act of 2003, was introduced as an addition to the Child Abduction Protect Act of 2003, widely recognized as the AMBER Alert bill (S151). The \"RAVE\" Act had not passed a single committee before being attached to the AMBER Alert bill. In addition, it was so controversial when it was introduced during the 107th Congress that two Senators withdrew their sponsorship.The \"RAVE\" Act makes it easier for the federal government to prosecute innocent business owners for the drug offenses of their customers - even if they take steps to stop such activity. This is a threat to free speech and musical expression while placing at risk any hotel/motel owner, concert promoter, event organizer, nightclub owner or arena/stadium owner for the drug violations of third parties - real or alleged - regardless of whether or not the promoter and/or property owner made a good-faith effort to keep their event drug-free. It applies not only to electronic music parties, but any type of public gathering: theatrical productions, rock concerts, DJ nights at your local club or tavern, and political rallies. Moreover, it gives heightened powers and discretion to prosecutors who may use it to target events they personally don’t like, such as Hip-Hop events and gay and lesbian fundraisers.The \"RAVE\" Act was passed despite the fact it did not have a public hearing, debate or vote in Congress. It is important to note that because of overwhelming opposition to the \"RAVE\" Act, legislators were forced to remove some of the most egregious language before it passed. For example, the word \"rave\" was removed from the version of the bill attached to the AMBER Alert. Eliminating such blatant discrimination is a victory for our continued freedom of speech. Also, the original bill suggested that prosecutors should view the sale of water and the presence of glowsticks or massage oil as evidence of drug use. These ludicrous \"findings\" were completely removed due in large part to activists who sent nearly 30,000 faxes in 2003 alone to their Senators urging them not to support the dangerous legislation.When it was first introduced there was widespread belief that the \"RAVE\" Act would move through the legislative channels quickly with no revision. Instead, it took 10 months, a change of power in the United States Senate, backroom policymaking, and substantial changes to the bill before it was passed - and even then it did not pass via \"normal\" legislative procedures.The \"RAVE\" Act gives the government even more power to harass and arrest innocent musicians, promoters, venue owners, and fans - all in the name of the War on Drugs. Law enforcement agencies already target certain types of musical and cultural events and the nightclubs that host them. The Drug Enforcement Administration is prosecuting nightclub owners and promoters that organize electronic dance music events and the military is using drugs as a pretext to close down gay nightclubs. In Michigan in March 2005, a nightclub was raided with some attendees reportedly being strip-searched and over 100 people being ticketed and slapped with a misdemeanor charge, just for being in proximity to people using drugs. A similar incident happened in 2002 in Wisconsin. In addition, drug laws are often enforced unevenly against African Americans and Latinos. Hip-Hop could easily become a target.

While the voting is still going on, one new Hamptons spot that didn't make it to the poll is the Surf Lodge in Montauk. The refurbished hotel and restaurant space is a late entry to the game, but whispers from all around are leading many to believe that this could be the place of 2008. And with the all star Cain team, Kamali, and Sam Talbot all lined up behind it, you'd be a fool to bet against them. Just yesterday, Jayma Cardosa let us know her thoughts, saying I have and will always love entertaining and sharing the joys of life with my friends. One of my secret joys has been my summer retreats to Montauk. It is here that I've found moments of great happiness, peace and enjoyed the simplicity of beach life. It is also in Montauk that I will realize one of my life time dreams of owning a hotel. I hope to see you this summer in a beach town that I hold doubly dear to my heart. She sure knows how to sell it. So maybe, just maybe, it's location in Montauk is a benefit, making sure those who go the extra mile will be justly rewarded. Only time will tell, but our money is on the Surf Lodge.

he Surf Lodge183 Edgemere St., MontaukP: 631.238.5190This first one on our list is, by far, the douchiest. This $350/night hotel/bar/restaurant/outdoor deck comes to you from the owners of GoldBar and Cain (site of the infamous “models and bottles” era) and is sureto be packed with the same crowd of people you go there saying you want to avoid but secretly enjoy the company of Expect an an excess of cash and a deficit of personality. The website’s description of the bar includes the phrase “THE après-surf spot,” and says the deck will host concerts from “big name artists.” The “big name” opening Memorial Day weekend? Julian Marley. That should give you an idea of what sort of “celebrities” this place will attract.

It's sad when jossip posts a negative \"review\" of places that aren't open yet, but it's quite a bit sadder to repost that here as if it were a contribution to the discussion. Chin up buddy -- you'll get to actually go to one of these places yourself someday. I had a good time there; it's like sunset beach, but the layout is a better for a substantial sized party. There were a few celebs there but I don't think the promoters were on duty -- no random tables of models, just trendy people. It's probably not a good substitute for someone who'd enjoy being packed like a sardine in Dune, but the share houses that frequent Dune are already used to close quarters. To each their own.

My girly and I drove past that place on Sunday eve and it looked like a typical Hamptonsesque clusterfuck. There were tons and tons of Range Rovers, BMWs etc. parked alongside the highway. There seemed to be a deck that looked packed, which was somewhat surprising, since it was freezing outside. Anyway the hilarious thing about the Surf Lodge is its location. It's not or even particularly near the beach. In fact, it actually overlooks a lake. The Surf Lodge is the polar opposite of Montauk. I wonder just how well they'll do, particularly as there are no Jet East's or Dune's nearby. I mean what are you going to do go to the Surf Lodge's bar every night?!?

I checked into The Surf Lodge this weekend. While I was checking in, the front desk received wiftle balls and bat. A staff member from The Surf Lodge went to pick it up for one of their guests because they over heard him mentioning he'd like to play wiftle ball. End of story is the service was outstanding, food was amazing and they have sweet bikes to tour around town and the beach. My take, was they aren't trying to be a Hamptons club, just a great retreat from the city.

Employees are encouraged to park on the road in front to give the appearance that people are actually in there. I am also told they bus in people from south hampton. WTF? i puke in my mouth every time i drive past there on my way to the Montauket. With out local support it will come and go.

I HATED IT. So even if the food was good (just ok really), it big on poor service and bigger on attitude. Dont waste your time or money. Not hte right fit for Montauk anyway - too nice a town for this kind of place. Not worth the 150 mile trip.

So, we decided to entrust a Little Birdy to be our on the scene eyes and ears at this year's Cannes Film Festival. Big mistake. We wound up not hearing from them for days, until finally we heard from them this afternoon. So Little Birdy, what do you have to say for yourself? So, I just got back from the Jade Jagger Belvedere Dagger Party. It was a lot better than it sounds. Jade Jagger, P. Diddy, Ed Norton, Goldie Hawn, Kelly Brook, Billy Zane, Mike Tyson, Vikram Chatwal and me partying at club VIP. Belvedere all over the place. It was raining but the turnout was still pretty incredible. One of the production people told me over 2000 showed up. Funniest part was Diddy (what is he doing in Cannes?) showing up with an entourage of 30 people, scooping up as many Belvedere drinks that he could get his hands on. Isn't he the face of Ciroc? Good thing they pay him all that money. Anyway, Marc Ronson was the DJ, music was awesome, and this whole week has been awesome. Sorry to not check in sooner but I am too busy living the life.You know what Birdy? If we paid you any money we would have to fire you. But we don't so we love you. Stay dry and try to check in more often.

You can tell from this article he is fat, that's for sure. I personally don't agree with his assessment because I don't find the drug addled hipster kids who round out the crowd there to be as attractive as the random models who round out the crowds at other historically good places, but to be fair they aren't trying to be one of those places. On a different note I think the success of the Beatrice is somewhat relative -- the New York nightlift scene isn't what it once was, and Matt's career and personal experience is limited. So if \"all time\" is the last couple of years, sure, why not.

Have you ever looked at Beatrice Inn. That is what Matt designed and the flower box at Smith and Mills. He hired Parts and labor to design Smith and Mills using Carlos's home as a cookie cutter. Each color, material, industrial mix even the play on light bulbs was taken from the house above. This artcle is so lame. They beat brand new wood floors with chains to mimic the floors above. That is Carlos\"s work, not Matt\"s. He has no sense of design, balance or proportion himself and was not able to technically build out either space in each instance the Department of Buildings was required. As for a deal maker, his notion of making a \"deal\" is to cheat for throw off a profit. He cheated every contractor in both businesses and did not honor his underlying agreements. All and all, the kid is a \"c\" lister and totally worthless.

Our good Tim from the Pink Elephant checks in to clarify the PE crew's summer plans, saying \"Pink Elephant will be operating as usual at Capri Hotel. The Tavern space will be now called La Playa. Same owners but unaffiliated with Pink Elephant. Two separate nightclubs with 2 different crowds. Hope this clears up PE’s role out East this summer. Pink @ Capri will be in full effect. Expect to see big things.\" Well, that's Capri apparently without the outdoor space, but still Capri. This makes our super DBTH Poll a little less accurate, but just a little.

IMG_1633, originally uploaded by R. K..We thank our hated enemies at Eater for sending a trusty intern to sit through the Community Board 3 Economic Development Committee meeting last night, where Dark Room's liquor license renewal permit was denied! According to Eater:The committee rejected Ludlow Street's Darkroom for a liquor license renewal. They cited several infractions including noise complaints a few counts of selling booze to minors. The bar will have to plead its case with the full board later this month.Underage drinking? In the Lower East Side? No! Maybe we need to bring back prohibition! We predict that they will make their case to some sympathetic Board members and the license will be renewed at the full meeting. What else would go into that basement space besides a bar? It may as well be Dark Room.

This is all so off. Pink Elephant is at The Capri and the outside is open. All you bloggers seem to have some bad information. The crowd on Saturday is far and away the best in the Hampton's. Fridays are share houses everywhere.La Playa is at Tavern. It will be good on Saturday. Friday's have never worked there.Lilly Pond will have a hard time working because its all the way out east. Dune is a sweat box and the only place with no outdoor area.....HMMMMM who would be going around saying Pink has no outdoor space?????? Saturday will be ok. Fridays won'tIn no one wants to go out east, who is driving to Montauk. Has anyone been out to Montauk. The place may be cool if they are taking reservations from my parents. Its a cool concept and I am sure they will do ok but, don't hold your breath on all of this.In the end, Pink Elephant has been the best place out in the Hamptons the last two years and there is no reason to think it won't remain the same this year.

town of east hampton is going to put the screws to any \"restaurant\" that suddenly becomes a club....period.....who is driving to montauk anyway? it's a great place but unless you are staying out their it's a non-issue. Could be a great happy hour spot.Town of Southampton has major issues with PE @ capri again it used to be a \"restaurant\" as an accessory use to the \"hotel\" (motel). Parking was/is an issue, as is/are the bathroom situation. again it is not set up to be a club, period.Tavern space is a diaster. again Parking a major problem. With County rd 39 being $ lanes good luck crossing the road for alternative parking. a girl was killed last yr doing that when it was 2 lanes. \"Tavern\" relies on Porta Potties as a good portion of bathroom capacity. Can you imagine....Jimmy Choo's in a nice warm, overused pottie in July! That makes Dune the clear winner, they can be selective and send all the b/t crackheads to tavern

In a case of what the hell were they thinking, the Observer has news of two embattled East Village establishments, Death & Co. and Le Souk, who are both battling the fickle SLA. Amazingly, Death & Co. have not swayed the SLA to re-instate their license, while Le Souk has managed to hold onto theirs for another week. Exsqueeze us? Something about this is just off. While we have had our issues with Death & Co with small operational items, overall we find it to be a rather well run cocktail den. Le Souk is another beast, with underage crowds, loud music, fights and a general garbage atmostphere. To sum up, the SLA should desire establishments like Death & Co. But since they are the SLA, they do all they can to run them out while Le Souk manages to remain open. No wonder the Governor needed some adult fun, he worked for NY State!

What's the FDNY's favorite bar in New York City? Why, the Beatrice Inn of course! If it wasn't then why would they spend so much time there? A Little Birdy was there Friday night when New York's bravest stopped by yet again, and apparently this was more than just the old in and out. \"They came on Friday night when it wasn't crowded at all and were there for a long time, checking the sprinklers and floorplans,\" our Little Birdy tells us. That's not a fun way to spend a Friday. Until this blows over, we expect the City's tightest door to be even tighter. A slow Memorial Day weekend might just be what the Beatrice's doctor ordered.

One of the most amazing parts of lilly pond will be the music. Their DJ roster consists of such names as DJ AM, Steve Aoki, DJ Berrie and many many more.\" Sounds awesome!

Let the Hype machine begin. Odds this place will blow and some unsuspecting I-banker will get \"raped\" on his service charge, 2:1? I think it was an absolutely amazing Idea for the Cain boys to take over Surf Lodge. Hamptons is basically overdone and Montauk is much more chill/relaxed. Less people attempting to be seen than trying to enjoy themselves.

If a place NEEDS a press release to get a buzz, it probably is going to suck hard, and this would be consistent with most clubs in the hamptons (because, of course, most people drive 100 miles to the beach so they can sit crammed inside a noisy, airless box). willbeg: I could not agree more. Jamie Mulholland might be onto something there.

One of our most trusted Little Birdies was on the scene last night at Wildwood, the new BBQ restaurant from B.R. Guest on Park Avenue South. The occasion? A Kid Rock post show after party. They filed this report:Good crowd. Some SMOKING hot girls. Free BBQ ribs, which were excellent. Open bar - Coors (sponsor), Plymouth Gin, Jim Beam. Everyone was chilling basically just waiting for Kid Rock to show up, which he eventually did at about 1:45 with a bottle of Beam and a cigar in hand. Not a bad way to make an entrance. The food and festivities went until 4 AM I'm having a rough one today. Late night BBQ and Beam sounds like an OK way to spend a Thursday night, even if you wind up paying for it on Friday. Kid sure looks happy up there. And it just proves that New York still loves the hours between 2-4.

Have you tried their new steak place on Park Ave south, \"Primehouse\"? Not good. If they do to BBQ what they did to steak, I'd stay away...

I agree, Primehouse does need some work, but should not be grouped with Wildwood. Wildwood has really great BBQ. I was surprised how amazing it was.

Right, is this just the James Murphy event or is the secret that it's actually an LCD Soundsystem show instead of James Murphy DJ set?

Sammy Sass may no longer (or never been) involved with Noah and Jason's upcoming Lavo restaurant and nightclub at the Palazzo, but our LB was correct in Sammy's interest in Vegas. We just got word that Sass will be opening a branch of his London club Movida in the Palazzo. This follows the current Vegas strategy of trying to lure big spenders from Europe as the American economy hits the shitter. Especially with the slowdown in tourism and spending in Vegas. We always say the more the merrier, but Lavo and Movida going head-to-head? This should be interesting.

There are just so many events going on right now, we can't possibly hit them all. Luckily, we have our #1 correspondent Nicolette from Nicolette and the City there to pick up the slack.Last night I went to the Charlotte Ronson and Chrissie Miller “Summer Lovin” event at Blue & Cream. I showed up fashionably late with my cousin James at 7:00 p.m. (the event started at 6). We walked in and the doorman (same guy from Antik) said the ice cream was outside (served from two Mister Softee trucks) and the vodka was inside.We headed on over to the open bar and we had a choice between sponsored Svedka vodka with pineapple, orange juice, or a pink concoction mixed with lemon juice, vodka, and pink lemonade. I chose the pink concoction and yes I chose it because it was pink. But hey Vodka is Vodka.After grabbing our drinks we started to socialize. I ran into the designer of the night, Charlotte Ronson. After chatting it up with Charlotte I then ran into the Unruly Heir crew (who I met at the Unruly Heir event at Bloomingdales last week). I spent some time socializing with Kristian Laliberte and Unruly Heir creator Joe Goodwin.After a few photo ops we headed outside. I had vanilla ice cream with rainbow sprinkles ( wow did I feel 12 again) from the Mister Softee truck while James chose Vanilla ice cream with chocolate sprinkles. We sat on the yellow ottomans outside, enjoyed our ice cream, and headed back inside for a few more drinks, some socializing and surprisingly some shopping?!? James ended up buying two shirts from Blue & Cream. By eight I decided to call it a night and headed home. It was a fun laid back night, in the nice spring weather eating ice cream and drinking vodka. Could you ask for more?

Jamie, Jayma and the rest of the Cain gang have long planned to escape their first home in Chelsea and set up shop somewhere else. After several false starts, they had apparently settled on an alley space at 408 Broadway. Uh, not so fast. After pulling their liquor license application from the last CB 1 meeting, a Little Birdy tells us that unfortunately, the plans may have to be scrapped completely. The Community Board is dead set against Cain, or any re-imagination of it, opening in their ritzy hood. Alley or no alley, lower Broadway or wherever. The Cain crew has not given up hope of pulling something off here, but it's just not looking to good.

Unless you want to travel down the way back machine, you are probably going to have some trouble finding our earlier posts related to the Satsky, Gefter, Mullineaux and Cantor. Why? After receiving some worthless cease and desist orders from some attorneys, we decided to take them down. While we are positive that nothing we posted would ever proven to be libelous, it really isn't worth our time or effort to worry about dealing with half ass accusations. After all we are only talking about the people that owned and operated Stereo, a little club that had a pretty good run for a few years, but is hardly missed by the nightlife loving public. There have been a thousand clubs that have had runs that were as good or better. These guys just had a pretty ugly falling out, and instead of chalking it up to lessons learned or a bad business deal, they decided to send nasty emails to us to try and settle their differences. All in all, pretty lame. We are actually glad the lawyers stepped in to remove us from this \"Battle of the Pansies\". If this doesn't work, maybe we can all meet at Houstons and settle this once and for all.

We couldn't attend the Time Out Horny Party last night, so we asked a TONY insider to fill in the gaps. Apparently, the attendees were filling in more than that. Let's go to the correspondent . . .The last time we played Spin the Bottle was tenth grade in our friend Steve’s basement, but that’s neither here nor there. Last night we got down, drunk and dirty with Time Out New York at their Horny Party to celebrate their annual hormone (and nudity) filled issue. The Pinetree Lodge was brimming with sexually charged 20-somethings playing Truth or Dare and Never Have I Ever. Uh, never have I ever been so excited to see a burlesque dancer strip on a bar in Murray Hill. The night dissolved into a gigantic game of Spin the Bottle. Guy and girl, girl on girl, guy on guy on girl on guy on Time Out New York staff member on bartender on bouncer. Us exhibitionists found ourselves making out in the back room while the voyeurs touched them selves at the bar. And just like tenth grade, we went home agonizingly heated up, in need of a cold shower, and with a magazine full of naked people wedged in our messenger bag.Sounds hot and steamy. Maybe next year we can attend.

The Randolph is a deceptively excellent little bar on the edges of Nolita. And according to a Little Birdy, it may be getting a little bigger. Our LB tells us that the owners are looking to expand the basement space a little bit to create a nicer lower level experience. We would be all for it, since it is a bit basement-esque down there, and it would give the City just a bit more space in which to enjoy a full pitcher of Manhattans. And what American can be against that?

Radar Online \"broke\" a story today that Keith McNally was looking to buy DBTH favorite the Beatrice Inn. Thankfully, Eater put the kaibosh on this rumor, with McNally telling them \"I've barely heard of this place, let alone considered buying it! An absolute NO to the rumor, but I'm flattered (if that's the word) that I should be someone reckoned to be in the running.\" This one should have never gotten off the ground, since the space simply lacks the capacity to do enough business to justify McNally's time. We feel dirty doing a post on it, but it is our business.

Even though we love warm weather and picnics, we may have to officially come out against the Picnic Club.

Right as rain, as the weekend approach, the weather report turned anything but suite, with meteorologists saying it looked like rain. So Allison and Michael have to cancel once again. Maybe, for the sake of all of us, the Picnic Club should just quietly go about their business without publicizing their first event. Let that one go off without a hitch and that we can all get back to picnic business. We can't stand the rain.

From the weekend desk of DBTH, a Little Birdy sent us (and everyone else thank you very much) this quick note, \"Both home and guesthouse are closed until further notice\". Oh the humanity. Will NYC nightlife ever recover from this low blow to our souls? Will New Jersey and Strong Island keep their flags at half mast for the rest of the weekend? Will Steve Lewis get to redesign the clubs when they are taken over by another operator. It's way too early in the grieving process to answer these questions. You can tell the Guesthouse patrons above are wondering the same thing. Consider this developing.UPDATE #1: When we asked our LB why the club was shut down, we were told it was the cops. Apparently they were cited for underage drinking and drugs. Maybe we should hang out there more often.UPDATE #2: A mysterious go between drops a note to us, saying \"Hi I'm sitting with Steve Lewis who just got a call and says...\"home and guesthouse will be open tonight!\" We are honored and wish to thank both you and Msr. Lewis. Go get em Guesthouse.

Straight from the beak of a Little Birdy who was on the scene, we get word that the Betarice Inn was visited by the cops again last night. Take it away LB:I was at the Beatrice Inn last night and something was going down. Around 2 they stopped playing music and the dance floor cleared out. When I left a little while later, there were cop cars outside and the doorman was talking three cops. Maybe they got busted for not having a cabaret license again?Except for running Manhattan's coolest bar, running the hospitality operations at a new Atlantic City resort, celebrity friends and possibly opening new bars on both coasts, these Beatrice Inn guys can't catch a break. We aren't sure why the cops continue this monthly game of saying hello late at night, unless they really want to see MK. And let's be honest, who doesn't? But the Angelo and the crew do a good job of keeping the street clear and we have seen the neighbors drinking at the bar. Just leave Beatrice alone!

Allegedly.

Featuring maraschino liqueur, grapefruit and lime juice, it's the perfect tequila cocktail to keep you refreshed when drinking in a sub basement during the summer - if Stefan ever lets you in.

Building up a mysterious internet identity is something we know a bit about. So did Guest of a Guest, until today. That's her up there wearing the vest and hanging out with pumpkins. Looks just like we said she did. She's our buddy, and now she wants to be yours too. Meet her everyone, and then Facebook her, and then call her, and write to her, and do everything because Rachelle is the [cough] force [cough] behind GoaG, and apparently she has some big plans and stuff and wants you to read all about it as she sits down with her Uncle Steve to chat.

Studio B (which we all know has some hot ladies) recently opened a rooftop lounge, even though they apparently never had permission. New York Shitty has a real problem with this, stating: Let’s imagine for a moment that I, a citizen, invited 140+ of my best friends to party on my rooftop (and I have a nice one, btw). Someone would call the cops and I’d be cited and/or thrown in jail.In other words, it’s a matter of inequality. Studio B, despite having no permission to host events on their roof does so anyway. It doesn't seem fair, but the party does indeed soldier on.

Another tidbit of information that bubbled to the surface during the Cordell Lochin legal tizzy was Serge Becker had plans to open a second La Esquina in Miami. So exciting. Well, DBTH has learned a bit more intel on the project, and it's shaping up to be a doozy. The word from South Beach is that Becker and his posse have signed a deal to open La Esquina in the soon to open Mondrian South Beach Hotel and Residences, and that Becker will operate not only a La Esquina lobby restaurant but also a roof top bar. Good deal for Becker, but will taking a restaurant that is known more for its basement than its food to the land of Latin cuisine be a success? Will it diminish the strong La Esquina brand here in New York City? Only time will tell, but as one wise operator told us, \"your brand is your brand it's best not to fuck with it.\" Indeed.

Indeed. Serge Becker is a gangster and he regularly associates with convicted drug dealers and drug addicts in NY and FL until they get thrown into prison or riddled with bullets, then he pretends not to know them. Miami residents should do everything to keep him out or watch their neighborhood go (even further) down the tubes. His business model depends on narcotics trafficking. Got crack?

Anyway, what is now a parking lot is soon to be a new hotel project from the genius that is Ian Schrager. It's a bit of old news, but Schrager's plans to open a \"combination of high-end hotels and less expensive hotels\" on this site by 2009 seems doubtful. You know, credit crunch and all. But at least we all still get to use that parking lot, and then one day, people paying a lot of money and people paying a bit less will all get to stay right next to each other..

Belvedere kicked of their Downtown Meets Uptown party series last night at the new Rose Club at the Plaza Hotel. DBTH hasn't been that far uptown since... we'll we don't know when, but it was a pretty fancy soiree and we are still nursing our nosebleed. It was a mix of tuxedoed uptown society types, mixed with a handful of downtown hipsters. This was more than an event - this was a pah tay! The Belvedere and rose champagne were flowing (and mixed vodka drinks served in cute mini-Belveder bottles) and Citizen Cope performed an intimate set for the 200 or so guests. The A-List celeb crowd was out in full force and we spotted Harvey Weinstein (literally half the man he used to be), Matthew Perry, Malcolm Gladwell, James Gandolfini and enough models to bang all the Russian billionaires who reportedly bought all of the apartments upstairs. Judging by the female escorts these gentlemen had on their arms it is safe to say that if you get famous, you have it made.For those of you who missed out, have no fear. This is the first of a series of events, and lucky for you, we will be there to cover them all. More like lucky for us.

A Little Birdy writes: I work for a charity, and we're having our annual fundraiser at 1oak tomorrow (thursday) night. The charity is Starfish Greathearts- we raise money for children who have been orphaned by HIV or AIDS in southern Africa, and the party is from 8-11 and has all the usual trappings of a charity event that you would expect at 1oak: hot music, fierce raffle prizes- a tocca gift bag.. airline tickets... personal styling by Diddy's own stylist- open bar, etc. Seems like a good cause and they are giving away some good stuff. A night with Diddy's stylist is worth a lot and open bar for charity never hurt anyone either. Go out and support them tonight. And get the hell off our backs.

They changed the door staff a few months ago. The new guy at the door, Gaenz or however he spells his name has absolutely no idea what he's doing but thinks he's the greatest thing since sliced bread and unfortunately Simon doesn't seem to get that. Everyone is laughing at the guy, he doesn't know the right people and he's rude, neither work for a place where people spend at least $2K a table. People who can afford that on a regular basis are either fairly educated and expect to be treated politely at the very least, or they are culture-less nouveau rich. The former have started to stay away and now they are filling the place up with the latter. The place was great because it had a sexy \"everything goes\" family, almost swinger-club atmosphere to it which was its draw but when the door-guy starts to give deer-in-a-headlight stares to the regulars, the community aspect is lost and it becomes just another club, and for that it's way too expensive for what's left to play with. It's a shame.

Yuck -- anon above -- why are you posting some random news feed saying that Madonna and Justin Timberlake were there at some Jose Cuervo sponsored party doing tequila shots, to try to make it sound cool? Like that somehow means it's cool? Lindsay Lohan and Samantha Ronson were at the Hawaiian Tropic in Times Square last weekend. Does that make the place cool? If anything, it's all the more evidence that the crowd that hangs out on 27th street has now migrated over to Chrystie Street.I guess people nowadays think that some place is DA SHIT just because some random celeb pops in (and in this case, neither of which actually lives in NY) -- hey, I got a new hotspot for ya -- there's this secret place that both Madonna and Justin go to every single night -- it's been rumored that Britney and Paris occasionally stop in once in a while too -- it's called the toilet, -- i hear it's also kinda small and doesn't smell so good -- maybe you should check it outp.s. And more importantly, if it's so cool, why weren't you there, rather than linking to some allheadlinenews.com article. and who else was at this 'celeb-filled' Jose Cuervo party?

And because this is the internet, you can do it all anonymously! But you never know when that may come back to get you, so commenters beware.. Rate My Promoter [Via Jossip]

What's the best way to lure New York City's weekend escape artists to your brand new, non-gaming hotel in Atlantic City? Hire some well established New York City nightlifers to run the clubs, and throw a party in New York to show what your new hotel is made of. That's exactly the strategy that the Chelsea Hotel AC followed last night, throwing a little how's your father soiree at the Beatrice Inn. Wonder how they chose that. The party started at 7 and ended on the early side, but somehow when you step into the upstairs room, it can be any time of the day. The crowd was mixed, with employees from Cape Advisors and the Starr Restaurant Organization mingling with other suits, publicists and high and mighty nightlife insiders. Ahem. The best part besides the open bar? It would have to be the catered menu from the nearby Morimoto, Stephen Starr's temple of sushi here in NYC. Dungeness crab, rock shrimp, yellowtail and the like went down oh so smooth. Oh yeah, they also gave out towels. Although it was crowded, the party was a nice way to kick off the night. If the rest of the Chelsea's hotel and service operations go this smoothly, we predict big things there all summer long.

Stopping by the Pegu Club for a drink this weekend, we were tantalized by a wickedly delicious cocktail that left us wanting for more. Called the \"Poquito Picante\" (meaning, a little heat), the gin based drink consists of muddled jalapeno pepper, cilantro & cucumber, cointreau, and lemon juice. It's served up with a jalapeno to dare those who want a bit more spice, and is beyond smooth. We suggest climbing those steps to enjoy several.

Says our LB:Suk Sung, of Opera, Crimson, and Mood (though probably less proud of that last one), is moving from LA to Vegas at the end of the month to help start it up.Our Little Birdy explains further that managers and hosts from both coasts are looking to move to the desert, and really, who can blame them. Unlike LA and NYC, hospitality makes the Vegas world go round, so middle management types are eager to use hotel mega clubs as a spring board to increased pay and greater opportunities. Tax trouble not included.

Joshua Toas, the CEO of the New York State Liquor Authority, quietly resigned last week. Local community groups loved Toas, a man greatly credited for cleaning up the much-maligned SLA. According to Susan Finley (Flatiron Alliance), \"He was behind the movement to clean up the SLA, which was totally out of control. He actually came to meetings and took phone calls.\" It's amazing that just returning phone calls is enough to make you a hero. Immediate fall out? Probably not much. Expect the issuing of liquor licenses in the City to still be restricted, due to the backlash of the Community Boards. However, any job at the SLA is about as cozy as you can get, so we expect Gov. Patterson to look to fill it on the quickness. NYC may then see an increase in licenses at the City tries to stay above the economic downtown the only way it knows how - through the bottle. .

Here's the skinny on the Box:basically, most of the dudes I know are frankly sick of the attitude at the door -- which is way over the top, even for a supposedly \"elite\" club -- I know clubland regulars who get hassled at the door, while friggin Russians and Lithuanians who can barely speak English have bribed their way inI know I've had to wait on numerous occasions, only to find that it wasn't worth the wait -- girls NOT hot, crowd NOT cool, and drinks definitely OVERPRICEDon another note, a lot of women I know have also decided to boycott the box on principle after two women were abducted and raped right as they were leaving the club -- many hold the management accountable at least indirectly for allowing this sort of thing to happen and not providing adequate security for the people who go there

They called you worse than Guest House. Is Suzie going to just take that? Hell No. Comeback time:whoever wrote that last comment really has no clue. maybe if you came inside you would have seen a real party. come check it out one night for yourself before you open your mouthWe will add the ! ourselves. Not so witty but the line in the sand is drawn. Since it's warm again, may we suggest a Top Gun style beach volleyball contest?

Either the liquor demand at Suzie Wong's is through the roof, or someone forgot to pay the distributor. How do we know? A Little Birdy on the scene last night reports, \"Illegal liquor being delivered to suzie wong's at 11:30 pm??? No legal distributor is open then???!!!! In a toyota rav 4??? Something ain't right!\" That has to be a record for punctuation in a tip, but still, the info is highly unusual. But, according to Nicolette, Suzie's is apparently quite popular, and it isn't completely unthinkable for an owner or manager to call in backup supply from an off site storage facility or even grab an extra case of Dom from your kick ass pad. We always keep one on hand. Doesn't everyone else?

hahahah i hardly think liquor demand at suzie wong is through the roof...that place is ALWAYS dead. Anyway, liquor in NY is highly regulated- all deliveries must be made by licensed distributors and I highly doubt anyone involved in that waste of time venue has a \"kick ass pad.\" I am surprised though- i though suzie would at least last until mid summer before they started pulling this shady type of business...

oh really know it all. every single bar/club does this. i was in the liquor biz for 5 years. they all buy cases of liquor from liquor stores so they don't have to claim that they sold it. everything they buy through the distributor is accounted for.this is common practice, while not legal, and has been going on for years.

wow 5 whole years you must be a pro! not that i agree with the guy above you but lets just say the SLA doesn't accept these practices just because you think every place does this. spitzer is the one behind the tightened regulations and maybe when you were in the biz things were different but as someone in the biz now, i can tell you thats a royal f**k up to get caught doing that.

So what happens when your favorite night spot gets slammed with a bit of negative press? Take the offensive. Ray LeMoine decries Joshua David Stein's article from Page Six Mag, calling it a sham from the very start. LeMoine begins by saying, \"I don’t know if they have fact checkers at the NY Post’s Page Six Mag, but yesterday a story ran about The Box where the first sentence was a lie.\" As for the belief that the club may be slipping, LeMoine is adamant that the opposite is true, stating\"In truth, The Box is actually better now than a year ago. The owners have put together a more fluid show, one without boring filler acts. And the crowd is more downtown than a year ago. After Box-owner Cordell Lochin was locked up for drug trafficking, Serge Becker, another owner, hired Christian Alexander. Christian lives in the LES and is tied to downtown’s art, music, fashion, and media circles more than anyone who’s ever worked at the Box save Hammerstein. Lochin was known for his celeb-ties, whereas Christian is the guy celebs come to for a unique egalitarin NYC vibe. Now on any given night you’ll see a Supreme-type with a bartender from a local spot hanging with Ally Hilfiger and Robin Thicke.That's hot. That's so so hot and cool. But is it true? Our experts say possibly not, with a Little Birdy saying that while some musicians are still showing up to get on stage, the overall celeb buzz has dried up drastically. This debate is far from over, but maybe that is true for The Box too.

On top of being Alan's son, Robin Thicke is the only white R&B singer with more black fans than white fans, which, to me, the author of the above post, is very funny. I can also testify, based on what my own retinas and friends' eyes have seen, that celebs still hang at The Box on the reg. I could list who we've all seen there over the last 10 nights but it's a long list. Olsen, Ashley; Lo, Cee to name two...Not that I give a fuck, but Stein's piece makes it sound like some other place has taken the A-list crowd away, which just isn't true. This time last year I was writing a feature on The Box for NY Mag (unlike Stein, I had all access and did extensive interviews with Simon and Richard). A year later, I'm still following the venue and the story. I have no vested interest in The Box. But, fact is, The Box is better now than a year ago. Here's why: the show is better, more insane. Second, the crowd is more diverse (I was inside the club for 3 weeks straight last April-May and it was a homogenous banker-model crowd--very few \"artists\"). These days, show up btwn 2-3am and it is a very downtown crowd. Is it \"cool\"? I can't define that word...but def more diversity...Anyway, the first sentecne lie I refer to is about about Stein being there at 1am on a Monday. No one I spoke to remembers a late Monday party at The Box for some time. In fact, there was an early JCPenny Monday event that ended before midnight. And I confirmed Stein was there late night on a Friday. Prove me wrong, I'd like that, because it sucks to think a magazine that reaches 1 million people wouldn't fact check. Even if the first sentence turns out to be fact, the overall story was weak--an uniformed half-ass hit job--with a final quote from another P6 reporter of all people. Thanks,Ray LeMoine

Does anyone else think that it doesn't matter what celebrities go to a place, if it sucks, it sucks, and if its fun, its fun? When did that become the deciding factor in whether a nightlife spot is good or not. I've met enough celebrities to know that most are painfully boring and stupid, and your friends are probably much cooler. God, I hate this city these days.

If they are so great why o why can't they stay in business for more than 1,2,3....5 years???? flavor of the month that's why.

This whole thing is such a joke. The Box is so NOT a fun place to go. The crowd there is so fucking Jersey and Eurotrash that it stopped being cool about a year ago. Maybe some random hip hop artists stumbled in and showed up at 5am to get on stage when they had left whatever cool party or event they were at earlier, but that is far from the place to be anymore.Hey Ray DeMoines, ever thought that maybe your puff piece in NY Mag might have been what did this place in?

Two weeks ago it was full of dodgy Euros, bankers and trashy looking girls. And the stage show was a joke. I;ve seen better in a mainstream circus big top. Just because girls dance with their tops off doesn't make it cool. Null points.

I can't really say that The Box has a \"cool\" (call it whatever) downtown crowd. It's just a bunch of rich kids tryin to be downtown, they all spend daddy's money on overprized booze. I used to love the Box, cuz it's around the corner from me, but hangin out with a bunch of wall street type of dudes with no manners isn't really what I call fun and exciting.

The Box was never cool, never hipster and is/was only downtown bc its location is physically downtown.big deal, some celebs went there and they show a risky show which after seeing once is lame. paying $2K for a table and being able to buy your way in immediately makes the club not cool. fact. i was there a few times when it opened and a few times recently bc some of my girlfriends like to hang there. i've been going out in the city for 10+ years and i can honestly say i really dont like going there. everyone is so caught up in celebrity and making that a defining factor i keep thinking we have reached the tipping point and it just keeps going on and on... i will say this has been one of the better comment threads i've read in a while

It's true, anonymous, my feature for NYMag was killed for \"skewing too young.\" I didn't say it ran in my initial comment that, just that a year ago I was on assignment. You can read it here though: http://medicineagency.com/blog/archives/313 Venues and crowds do indeed change over time. Still, The Box is the rare venue that's better now than a year ago. I don't know what club you were visiting last winter and spring, but when The Box opened it really was a homogenous, monied crowd with the occasional Damien Loeb or some other Simon friend thrown in.Yes, on some night's nowadays there's a bunch cockheads in suits. But overall, there's a better vibe now c/o Christian Alexander. Cordell was cool, sure, but he didn't bring in the downtown/ghetto thug crowd. And to the DeMoines-caller, I certainly did not write a puff piece. I didn't serve four tours of 'Nam to write fluff?! Really though, what's a better club in NYC? Beatrice is Life and Spa Wednesday's ten years later but every night--aka nothing new. 1Oak is Butter Monday seven nights a week, woo hoo! The electro-sleaze scene is seven years dead. Tenjune is a clone. Marquee Weds is still fun but too Goth/nu metal. Sway is fun on Mon, Sun, Thurs, but--again--nothing new. Studio B-list is just that. Bacaro is the Hole on valium without DJ Gibby playing Minor Threat and Biggie. Rose Bar is gorgeous but a temple to Schnabel's cock. etc. etc. etc. At least The Box offers a unique concept in a great room w/ a central downtown location. If everyone knows some secret place where there's only hot chicks and no Euro/Wall St/NYU assholes, I'd love to know about it. Otherwise, why not look at The Box as a unique institution and enjoy all the STDs and controversy that it creates?Ray LeMoine

Beatrice Inn -- way cooler than the BoxSubMercer (now reopened) - way cooler than the Box as well -- if you want to go out and enjoy NY nightlife, I'd recommend these over the box any day of the week -- plus I'm sure there will be a few new venues this summer that would be worth your time and moneythe Box is just a plain shitty unpleasant place to be in, literally, physically, with all that fucking stench of Euroshitthe sad thing is that even Serge Becker's Joe's Pub was classy and had cool/interesting performances -- La Esquina's not a bad joint eitheron the other hand, the Box is a place that just makes you wanna pukethen, on top of that, thrown in an airhead doorman who's not cool, or in the know, but just plain DUMB, and you've got probably the most disappointing nightlife experience in recent memory -- they deserve all the shit and smackdown thrown at them not because the detracters are \"haters\" but because the owners/supporters are poseurs -- the Box deserves to be shoved face-first down into the pavement precisely because of how much hype it tried to generate upon its arrival with all its PR whoremongering -- as if it were the new STUDIO 54 -- NOT!as for the door policy, well that itself is also a jokeas much as it might be hard to believe (and I'm sure others might differ on this, as to each his own), but Wass, Angelo, Megan (good old Megan from back in the day at Hiro and other places) were all naturally tough door-people, but they were seasoned, smart NYers with an understanding of NY club culture, and thus they were definitely a cut above the assclown known as gans or whatever the fuck his name isI've actually had pleasant exchanges with Wass, Angelo, and Megan in the past, and they get my props -- Gans, however, deserves a one-way ticket back to Kosovo

NYCVET -- \"I've actually had pleasant exchanges with Wass, Angelo, and Megan in the past, and they get my props -- Gans, however, deserves a one-way ticket back to Kosovo\"Bitter much? I've never heard anyone refer to Wass as \"pleasant\", and he's been working doors for more than ten years? The Door at the box is no nastier than anyplace else, New York is a tough city for a guy. To be fair to the Box, they spend an incredible amount of time, effort, and money to try to make an interesting show every night. You may not like it, but they are doing something different, and had a real vision for a space. (Rose bar has a very different vision, but you can't argue that they made a quite a beautiful space). You go on and on about how shitty The Box is, but Beatice has the shittiest decor of any trendy bar -- it is a lousy space with essentially furniture collected from the local sidewalk. In the daylight you wouldn't want to sit down in there. It is arguably the best place in the city, but I think your constant urge to puke probably comes from snorting something not meant to be snorted in that shitty bathroom at the Beatrice.

Poor The Box. Simon Hammerstein and Serge Becker's theater du nightclub really specializes in getting poor press. After Joshua David Stein's page turning expose in this past Sunday's Page Six the Magazine revealed the seedier side of the club, may had us wondering what else could possibly happen? According to a report on Animal New York, \"Now someone is going around and warning the public about the club's bouncer Gans, claiming he's an alleged \"DRUG PEDDLER\" and that he \"RAPED TWO WOMEN.\" Well, that certainly is no good. See what happens when you try to be different? We have always supported the Box for at least trying something in the staid atmosphere. But really, it seems to be just a matter of time before the other shoe drops.

According to our Little Birdy, \"the place was pretty star studded. Broderick, SJP, Seinfeld, Ricki Lake and Bette Midler were all there. Besides, who could pass up free Nobu?\" Well, the sushi sounds OK, but those celebs seem a bit tired to us. Funny picture though. Aren't they a cute couple? Gorgeous. Gorgeous.

Let's fly out to the Left Coast to discuss a juicy rumor from our friends at HotelChatter. It seems that New York hotelier Eric Goode has his eyes on the mysterious Magic Castle in the heart of Hollywood, and Sean MacPherson may not be part of it. So who is the replacement? According to HC, it may be New York City's own Serge Becker. What a tag team!So what do we think? From our own experience, the Magic Castle is a one of a kind property, a proper magician's club with an established hotel already operating next to it, plus a sushi restaurant boasting one of a kind views across the Los Angeles sky. However, it has been rather down and out over the past decade. This project reeks of Goode/Macpherson; rehabbing an existing property and making it a destination, and the castle architecture could make it the next Chateau Marmont. Uh, maybe not that far. We are just surprised to see Becker possibly replacing MacPherson on this one. Hope everything is ok with the dynamic duo.

Is Soho finally rediscovering its inner nightlife? If Zev Norotsky and Company have their way, the answer is a resounding yes. Zev checks in, saying \"I have a new lounge project called Origine (in the basement space of Fr.Og) opening on Spring b/w Crosby and Lafayette in early May, my partner is Matt Shendell (Dune, Honey, Dip). I have Ricky Powell (the 4th beastie boy) providing the images, for example an early, never before seen photo of the beastie boys and run dmc on a tour bus together during the mid-80's. Jarett Brodie (vong, aix) has been named executive chef of the restaurant upstairs called Fr.Og and we have a few high profile private dinner parties slated for the coming weeks. The concept is a very basic downtown lounge, I'm really trying to embrace the neighborhood and provide another nightlife option for that location. Zev also points out that this helps give their valuable Dune customers a NYC option before they head out east to the Hamptons during the hot summer season. Hot! We always think that downtown can use another downtown lounge, so this is right in our wheelhouse. Origine is opening soon - we will keep you posted.

Early Friday morning, we received several frantic emails regarding a possible raid at Smith and Mills. Later that morning, we received a copy of a letter to the local Community Board that our tipster (and Smith and Mills neighbor) submitted. Obviously there was some serious animosity between the two parties. Smith and Mills owner Matt Abramyck checked in with Grub Street (why not us?) on the matter with his neighbor Victoria Hillstron, saying “She has cornered my partner, yells at our staff, yells at our customers — she’s a real-life nightmare.”You know Matt, you may be on to something. Because when we woke up on Saturday morning, our in box was filled with 14 raving emails from Ms. Hillstrom, some with blurry photos, some with crude videos, that accused Smith and Mills from arson to running away with the spoon. We seriously doubt any of these claims, and sincerely apologize for getting involved with this mess in the first place.

Upstairs, how could you even have any of these places and not mention the Upstairs. by far it is much better than any of these other venues.sincerely,Richie A.one who loves the highest quality female talentSorry Richie A. We will try harder next time. Promise. One reader thought:I guess it all depends on what you like. If you want boring, vapid pretty girls with no personality, too much makeup, and priorities that revolve around blowing their way to the top, you can head to 1oak or upstairs, or marquee, or tenjune. But if you want girls that are actually capable of having a conversation, and our hot in that fresh faced, college type of way, I'd much rather head to a spot like Studio B. Shtooping dumb pretty girls has it's benefits, but some of these places just overdo it.Tell us how you really feel. Finally, our favorite response came from our winner, Rose Bar, who responded to the great news by sayingThis is NOT a confirmation.-----------------------We have received your reservation request; thank you for considering the Jade and Rose Bars at the Gramercy Park Hotel.If we are able to accommodate you we will reply with a confirmation email within 24 hours.Both bars begin daily service at 12 pm, with lunch being served until 3 pm.Reservations are required after 9 pm.Please note that the Rose Bar is closed on Sunday nights after 8 pm. Service is available in the Jade Bar only.Thank you,The Jade and Rose Bars at The Gramercy Park HotelNew York City everyone. Catch the fever.

Hey DBTH. You occasionally have good posts, but so many others fall so short of any interest at all, (reposting Jason Pomeranc's Blackberry ad and throwing in some fatuous exclamations?..., or, in this case, recapping people's responses to your own site?) C'mon man, do better. The Community Boards are in the process of turning Manhattan into a bedroom community with 2 am limits on liquor licenses and I've not seen one word of comment about it from you. Not so hip.

Dude this is a blog!!! This site is essentially one guys view and commentary on NYC nightlife, take from it what you find entertaining and the rest leave. But it is from this individual's point of view, if you really want to talk about the CB then start a blog and write about it. I am always a fan of post what entertains YOU if they like it great if not then get the F&^%$ off the site.

Below is the transcript of a letter written by an upstairs neighbor of Smith and Mills. This fight is beyond nasty!Dear Boards, Friends and Neighbors,Many of you read the article \"Bar Brawl\" in The Post and hope you know this was a publicity stunt. Not a word of this story was true. As you know there would be no reason to \"brawl\" on N Moore. They were asked to move a Moped. Sanitation had been after for weeks.I did write the Mayor because what they were doing had became dangerous. A danger to all of us. They had a fire and a history of fire. Our house could of burnt down. Our home is all 3 floors above them. They caught a womans coat on fire. Burning it to shreds. Had it been a few hours later there would have been many more coats and many more people. Someone could have been killed. That is why I wrote the Mayor. Packing so many people in and then lock themselves in with a look out to whistle when they see the Police. Police and Fire were not able to handle. Mostly because they tell so many stories. Somehow suggesting we were the only ones concerned. When all the neighbors had banded together to suspend their license suspecting their intent from the start.These are the boys from Beatrice Inn. Sadly, no one investigated or even the press would have connected the dots long before printing this story. Explaining the reason for no sign. When it turns out it was as simple as googling Matt Abramcyk and Beatrice Inn all along. Since its no secret what they are up to in the media. It seems this had to do with their troubles at Beatrice Inn. Rather then anything that had happened here and their concerns for getting caught on both licenses.We were told of \"the neighbor\" above Beatrice the day the story broke. Seems she got them in a world of trouble costing them a small fortune. They then paid her another fortune to move and leave her home. Then set out to make up these stories on us. All while the \"Mayor's Task Force\" was at Beatrice by thier own admission on google in an article \"Beatrice Currently Shut Down to Everyone, Not Just You\" at the very same time. For all of the same troubles we had with them here relating to soundspoofing, noise, issues of electrical & plumbing. Partying all over the streets till the wee hours. Having no regard for others or the law.New York Magazine said they were taking the \"offense\" in an article \"Smith and Mills Fights for Its Rights to Party\". When both are on restaurant licenses but have no kitchens. Strangely all in basements. In our case now attempting to cook to pretend it to be a restaurant ruining everything we own. Since that building has no vent or exhaust. In fear of getting caught on both licenses. While Hipguide New York just illustrated thier reasoning and not one department has stepped in to stop them. When its a danger to all to of us.Blackbook magazine's \"STRAIGHT OFF THE HANGOVER BEATRICE INN COMES MATT ABRAMCYKS SMITH AND MILLS spoke to their intent from the start. While preying on residentials streets, where its neighbors are unsuspecting, then preying on its residents. On the most beautiful and relevant tree lined streets in Manhattan.They even tried to arrest me, a resident of N Moore, for walking down the street. After being cited and fined by Police and Fire 3 times the week before. After throwing parties during fashion week for over 100 people in a single car garage and spilling on its streets. Waiting for me to innocently walk one day in one day and found it befitting to put a resident of an 8 bedroom home in handcuffs, over the word of a bar. Attempting arrest which failed. When they were caught lying to the officers by Annie, the Manager at Ivy's, demanding my release. Explaining to the officers they were lying. I was never told what I was accused or permitted to speak or even had my name and hope you can begin to grasp the brevity of how far they are willing to go in the name of thier folly.They now are telling even taller tales on the Supreme Court. Asking it to somehow concern itself with our home. In a lawsuit only meant to further harass us. When I've not spoken to them or looked in thier direction for 7 months after the false attempt. Yet the very relief seek from the courts. Harassing us full on ever since the false attempt and more out of control then ever which finally led to fire. I had told the Police I would write the Mayor because his daughter is our neighbor. Her building could have burnt down too. This \"sister\" story was pure cinema. Still insisting we were the only ones this concerned. Because that is what these boys had told them. I suspect with the same counsel that handled their troubles at Beatrice.After putting resident of an 8 bedroom home in handcuffs, breaking into our home, never having soundproofed the space because they have no money.In a space simply too small for what they are doing. I hope you can understand why anyone would call the Police. Its dangerous. Since they can not sue us for calling 311 or writing the Mayor or calling the Police \"anonymously\" they invented these fairy tales on us and the courts and press. Trading on our notoriety on a pack of lies, they know full well to be a to lies themselves, holding us up on our own notoriety. When they never even paid us for the space, damaged our home from stem to stern and we are the only ones who suffered any harm what so ever.To put a resident of N Moore in handcuffs or tell tall tales on the courts or break in anyones home in the name of a liquor license is completely and extremely serious. I'm not certain you can imagine what it would be like to have been preyed on because you were alone or harassed full on by boys in a bar. Afraid to leave your home in fear of what they will do next. Accused of stripping jackhammers from hotel construction workers in the press. Even accused of causing the hotel's delay in an attempt to give their false claim merit. Even trading on Robert Deniro's name in this lawsuit in an attempt to shop this story in the press which failed and ask that you lend your voices. Before we too in the words of Spencer Morgan of the Observer have \"Bedlam at Beatrice\" or others suffer harm too. Holy camoly Birdys. This one is getting real nasty.

This letter seems a bit far-fetched... and waaay too rambling. As I'm good friends with one of the partners at Smith and Mills, I can tell you that they've taken huge measures to make sure that the venue was up to standards and respectful of the neighbors. ESPECIALLY as they knew Bobby D's hotel would be going in, hence raising the profile (and the glaring eyes of the SLA) in the neighborhood.But you never know... I have to say, tho, that Beatrice has been asking for it recently, with the number of drunken Euros outside begging to get in... I'm waiting to see how this all develops.

I can't follow the incoherent narrative, but the Beatrice boys seem to push their luck -- I was once there for a fashion event and they kept 50 people waiting around outside for no good reason until the police inevitably came.Not smart for a residential block. This is why the nightlife industry is currently under siege; operators need to be smart as well as zealous in defending their right to run a business.

Can you believe it's almost May. It really is so close to summer share season! Yippee! In honor of the traffic on the LIE, we bring you this very special Hamptons report, with a Little Birdy saying:David Sarner & Bobby Montwaid, the duo behind the Pink Elephant brand, have partnered with nightlife impresarios Pavan & Shaun Rose to take over the Tavern space in Southampton formerly occupied by Stereo. The group will now have control of the space in the Capri Hotel known as Pink Elephant as well as Tavern, consolidating power over two of the only three nightclubs in the Hamptons to one group. The space at the Capri will remain Pink Elephant and plans for Tavern haven't been revealed yet. With everyone from Tenjune, Kiss & Fly, and Greenhouse vying for the space, it will be interesting to see how things develop between now and Memorial Day…Sure it smells of a press release, but it's so juicy that we don't really give a damn. As for who will get the space, maybe we smell a poll. Hmmm.

Sounds to me like some other owners or promoters are bitter about these guys getting this space. Pink was by far and away the best spot in the Hamptons last year. I think these Shaun and Pavan guys ran it last year. I think Tavern will be ok. Time will tell. Lily pond may be ok. The space is nice. a little far but, it could be ok.

Sixpoint Craft Ales is steadily growing, expanding it's offering of delicious brews and outlets, all from the comfort of its Brooklyn manufacturing space. Not only that, they are trying to be as sustainable as possible. How so? Jeff Gorlechen from the Sixpoint promotions team fills us in, saying:After being used for brewing beer, all of our spent grain is used to feed livestock on Long Island.We buy used/recycled kegs, especially our 5 gallon soda kegs, which are normally thrown out for scrap. We also don't bottle our beer, so there's no wasteful packaging. We fill the kegs, ship them to our distributor, they get shipped back to us, then they are returned to us, then we clean and refill them, then ship them back out again.We recycle the heat energy from the boiling process of the wort and use it to heat tap water for use in the next day’s brew.All of our brewers take the subway to work ;-)Truly great stuff Sixpoint. Keep up the great work!

you NYC fools can laugh all you want. next time you're in chicago, visit nightlife spots like underground, manor, lumen, krem, y bar, enclave, rino, stone lotus, etc. the quality of women at these places make rose bar and 1OAK look like a fat women convention. if you're intimidated by Chicago's exclusive nightlife, check out chicago during summer, especially rush street and lake michigan, when hotties are walking around half-naked. meanwhile, NYC is full of tourists and summer interns who are all baking in the oppressive humidity.

i'm sure chicago has good looking girls. Just bc you couldnt get laid in NY doesn't mean the talent here is lacking. My man, NYC is the model capital of the world to start, not to mention the hottest most sophisticated, hard working types. There's nothing sexier than a girl who is hot and knows what the fuck is up. go back to the midwest where life is just... well a little easier for you. NY isn't for the thin skinned. give me a heads up when you're coming back and i'll tell the girls to go easy on you next time.

i doubt regular tourists get into spots like rose bar and 1oak. i went to college in the east coast and have a lot of friends in NYC. it's an ok city if you don't mind living somewhere with garbage bags on street corners, rats and cockroaches, and smelly people on subway trains. the nightlife is mediocre; everything is so hyped up, and yet gullible people move into NYC every day trying to live the glamorous life depicted on sex and the city. but in reality, there's nothing special about NYC, aside from undeserved arrogance. people like myself chose chicago over NYC because we want to be in a clean city with a high quality of life, and an awesome nightlife without NYC's pseudo elitism.

i really don't understand the hype this place is receiving. the phrase \"trying too hard\" comes to mind. there are countless bars elsewhere (and by elsewhere i mean more convenient) than the rusty knot. in response to the comment about the place filled with \"suits.\" think about the bar's location...hello luxury condos.

wmwjzlFour weeks ago on a Thursday night we,my 2 girlfriends and my boyfriend trundled down to try the Rusty Knot.We are in the \"food\" industry so we had heard the hype and wanted to see for ourselves.First impressions were not good, we couldnt get in, as there was a line.But then we were greeted by a stylish Englishman who we now know as Gary, he told us that the wait wouldnt be long, and if it was, to go for a drink elsewhere and he would call us on our cell when he could accomodate us.Amazing, so simple yet, Id never had such service.When we did get in (the wait was like 15 mins) it was a mixed bag of suits and art people, good music, and we sampled the food ,but again only because Gary had managed to find us a table.We ate pretzel dogs, oysters and clams, all very well done, and neatly priced.Now ever since that first time each Thursday we have gone back, as we did last night.BUT....Gary is no longer there.We were told by the doorman that..\"he wasnt working tonite\" we were told by a bartender \"he doesnt work here anymore\" we overheard from another conversation that he had been fired ???I have yet to find out where he was, but what I will say is, the service was terrible, we couldnt get a table, and we left after 40 or so minutes.So, if you go to the Rusty Knot make sure Gary is working, he will make your night a lot more pleasurable than if he is not.

Ever wonder what happens at a gala for the Accompanied Literary Society at a private townhouse in Gramercy Park? Apparently, people collapse and get taken out on a stretcher in front of Harvey Weinstein and Graydon Carter! Thanks to the beauty of BlackBerry messenger, DBTH gets a scoopy scoop. Oh we oh my! That is so not good. This both makes and debunks the argument that these private clubs and societies should be courting younger members. Because what happens at the Accompanied Literary Society should stay at the Accompanied Literary Society.

In honor of Earth Day, we here at DBTH have asked some locals about to discuss what they do to promote sustainability. First up, William Tigertt from Freemans explains how one of our favorite spots keeps it green.We have several Green initiatives at Freemans:1. All deep fryer grease is recycled into Bio-Diesel.2. All paper, glass, metal and cardboard is recycled. It's the law, but a lot of small places just dump it for lack of space and effort.2. 60% of our power comes from Wind and hydro green providers (we're still working on finding vendor for the other 40% - high voltage meter)3. Our house brand bottled water comes from Maine in re-usable bottles that are sent back and re-filled.4. Our wine list is mostly European which is uses less energy to mass ship via freighter than trucking wines from California or shipping from Australia. The bulk of our list is also bio-dynamic or organic wine from small estate bottled traditional producers.5. Our eggs are all organic. Our diary is growth hormone free. We use mostly local producers and labor such as Heritage Foods pork which slaughters 1000 pigs a year versus 1000 pigs a day at large commercial farm. 6. Many of the building materials at Freemans are from reclaimed wood and recycled antiques7. We keep a small potted garden outside in the Alley which is used for herbs and maintained by local community gardener.We're constantly looking for new ways to reduce our footprint despite being such a busy neighborhood place.All excellent measures, keeping the food delicious with a minimal impact on the environment. Just like us. Stay tuned for more.

oh jesus, the global warming bogeyman invented by the power hungry scientists to protect their buddies in the corn industry by destroying all the poor people. biofuels are of course a giant mistake, and the environmentalists understand that, but it's easier for politicians to tell you to put corn in your car than it is to tell you to get rid of your car and walk to work.anyway, good for freemans. those sound like some thought out, basic level things that do good (shipping the bottled water back and forth is a little silly, but i guess you can't convince everyone to just drink the damn tap water). much better than places that buy a few low energy lightbulbs and pay a few bucks to plant some trees and call themselves \"green\".

I guess it all depends on what you like. If you want boring, vapid pretty girls with no personality, too much makeup, and priorities that revolve around blowing their way to the top, you can head to 1oak or upstairs, or marquee, or tenjune. But if you want girls that are actually capable of having a conversation, and our hot in that fresh faced, college type of way, I'd much rather head to a spot like Studio B. Shtooping dumb pretty girls has it's benefits, but some of these places just overdo it.

Looky what's back? The Flogging. Its been a while since we've been naughty, but when we are bad, we need to be punished. Now that the Greenwich Hotel and Ago are open to the (paying) public, David Rockwell and his firm have gotten a lot of credit and praise for the design. Undeserved credit, as Rockwell really had nothing to do with the exceptional work. It's time to set the record straight. We’d like to set the record straight on the proper design credits for Robert De Niro’s new Greenwich Hotel and Ago restaurant. While Rockwell Group originally developed a proposal for the site, those plans were abandoned over 4 years ago. Our firm, Grayling, designed the new building’s exterior, Ago restaurant, all of the Greenwich Hotel’s public spaces and guest corridors and one of the duplex suites (the other duplex suite was done by Rockwell Group). The building has a rich and detailed creative story that unfolded over several years and involved many talented people (Samantha Crasco, Mikio Shinegawa, Paul Alter of Skolnick Architects, Matt Markowitz). It would be a shame not to give proper credit where it belongs.We couldn't agree more and apologize for the mistake. In fact we had already discussed this way back when. But let the world know, Grayling did the work, and they did a heck of a job.

Also have been to see Erick Morillo (missed his birthday though), David Guetta night was unreal (hot women too!) and Carl Cox & Victor Calderone...I liked crobar, but Pacha blows them out of the water, bookings & atmosphere wise.

Ever wonder what the process is to get a full liquor license in New York City? Here's your chance to learn. Similar to being arrested, you submit some mug shot type photos and a set of finger prints. For example, the owners of the soon to open Trophy Bar posted their shots on Myspace. The things we do to open a business.

You have to get fingerprinted and have your photo taken when you get a rifle/shotgun permit too. I know people might say, \"well, of course you should.\" But if you have to do that for a rifle permit, you should have to do so for a permit where you handle alcohol too. This can take as many lives as a gun.

Employees Only has had a great reputation as a chill place to show up with friends, kick back and enjoy a few drinks. But are those days finished? According to a Little Birdy, the answer is a resounding YES! LB says:this happened over the weekend and needs to be printed...i went to employees only on Friday night for a drink with friends after a great dinner in the west village. we were meeting some other people there- happened to be all girls and we were a mixed party. it was raining and when we got there and there was no line. the bouncer said they were having a private party. classic bullshit line- i expect that treatment on 27th street, but not at employees only. we called his bluff then he asked if we had a reservation. we said no, because we didn't, but also added that we had never made a reservation to get a drink at employees only in the years we had been going there and lived in the area. he said we were obviously lying. right. we called his bluff again and he said it was just too crowded inside. the girls we were with could go in, but the guys couldn't. as this transpired, no less than 25-30 people left the bar (mostly guys) and they were still turning people away at the door- even just girls. we had it and went to the other room, which was great. since when did employees only develop that kind of attitude? i will never go back.We're sorry LB, we really don't know what this world is coming to. So Employees Only - what is your excuse? Please let us know.

Antik has been up and running for a few weeks now, and besides the opening night event, things at the retooled Bowery lounge has been pretty quiet. Well, we heard they were booked for a pretty important birthday party last Friday night and things didn't go so well. A Little Birdy checks in and confirms the rumors, saying:Went to Antik on Friday night for my friend's bday. She took the upstairs over for the night. It was really fun bc it was all our friends but i think people got a bit annoyed with the whole drink situation. They wouldn't let you order from the window/bar at the front only from the waitresses walking around which didn't come by often enough. The venue should be happy bc she brought a good crowd of a ton of big name models, marisa tomei, jamie burke, may anderson, few guys from the strokes etc, but the people running it were trying to be all velvet rope dbag when everyone there was there for this private party. not sure why they had to act all too cool at the door, it was a bit annoying. party was fun and our friends were djing so music was good. but the place cleared out fairly early which i assume was because of the drink situation. its real comfortable, lots of tables and places to sit. if they could hire a few more waitresses i think it would be a good spot to host a party.Slow drink delivery is not a good way to run a cocktail lounge, which goes back to our original theory. It takes more than a bar and a cocktail menu to run a proper lounge. Interaction with the bartenders, seeing the bottles and conversation with knowledgeable servers is how you run a lounge. This is apparently a mess.

So what can you really expect if you head over to Johnny Utah's super amazing, insanely fun Monday night party? Well, if you're Guest of a Guest , it's two girls taking off their clothes and double teaming the bull. Wowsa. Those gossiping fools get all the breaks.

Even after one LB's proclamation that the Box is still smoking hot, we come to find that all may not be well at the pseudo vaudeville club on Chrystie Street. According to an in the know Little Birdy, Simon and the boys are having some behind the scenes trouble. Apparently they can't find an attorney to represent them! In New York! OMG! Our LB says, \"The Box maybe not so hot actually. i hear they are looking for new representation. nobody will take them though b/c they are such a disaster -- girls being kidnapped and raped outside, celebs stopped going, and simon is a complete mess.\" But is he a hot mess? Or just trannie fierce? Jk. Anyway, if any of you eager beaver attorneys want to break into the business of nightlife litigation, make a bee line to the Box with a box of business cards. We smell an opportunity.

This is interesting. Does anyone know who they were using? Rob Bookman does a lot of this stuff as attorney and lobbyist. Generally lawyers like having screwed up clients -- they make for a lot of business. But only if they pay their bills on time.

Celebrity owners, celebrity fueled Italian restaurants, starchitects, and hand crafted bricks, it seems that Robert De Niro and Co. newly opened Greenwich Hotel had just about everything going for it. So as opening day approached, those of us who had been closely tracking the project were anxiously awaiting a chance to get inside and see what the fuss was about. But we (and every other website) was basically denied, with PR and staff saying the first look had been promised to an international publication. Turns out it was just a page in this month's Vanity Fair which spouts what all of you already know, hand-cut bricks, the corked ceiling Ago, pricey suites and all that jazz. One interesting point - all of the lobby art you see behind Bobby D. was painted by his late father. From what you can see, the place does look pretty sweet. David Rockwell and his team certainly delivered the goods, but it seems that we won't be getting inside to see for ourselves any time soon. For more frustrating fun, check out their revamped website which offers a few glimpses of what up to $1300 will get you.All images courtesy of Vanity Fair.

An invititation came into the Birdy Feeder last week for a fashion event to be held later this week (more to come on that later of course). After doing a quick scan, the location popped out at us - hmmm, Trophy Bar. Trophy Bar. What is Trophy Bar? Well, it turns out it is a brand new space that is about to have its grand debut this Friday night in mighty might Brooklyn. For some additional details, we go to their Myspace page, which reads:Stay Gold Gallery is pleased to present TROPHY – a unique nightlife destination in Williamsburg, Brooklyn.Trophy is presenting the newest musicians and DJ’s from around the world in a beautiful and welcoming environment featuring beautiful drinks and great music.Trophy offers a selection of 8 beers on draught, a concise wine list, and full liquor collection, with an emphasis on Tequila and Whiskey. The cocktail menu will offer signature drinks such as the Loving Cup, Goblet, Strongman, Bakelite and Runner Up. In addition to drinks, Trophy will offer a light menu of grilled sandwiches.Located under the elevated train in Williamsburg, the musical rumble of the train and turn-of-the-century construction set the tone for the interior space. Exposed brick, subway tile, dark wood, cozy lounge areas, and vintage trophies accentuate the building’s pre-war architecture. Trophy’s design is a contemporary nod to the neighborhood and its history, and the multi-use space will serve as both neighborhood bar and cultural establishment. Trophy also features a 700 sq ft back garden, which will be used jointly as a sculpture garden and beer garden. Exhibits will change quarterly.Trophy is from the Stay Gold Gallery team from the Billy, and will feature a carefully curated jukebox, live DJ sets and the like. Official address is 351 Broadway, right underneath the J Mofo Z. Tell the Good Doctor hello when you get to the hood.

And now, fresh off a still chilly Spring weekend in New York, a faithful Little Birdy files a report filled with celebrity sightings, bottle service and dancing from Upstairs. We ask that you not confuse it with Downstairs, the late night diner that most people will never go to. And now, for our LB:went to Upstairs last night (I know, I know, it's probably passe for LB). Met up with friends at mercbar first, and as we're walking to Upstairs, low and behold I spot chase crawford out of the corner of my eye--black sports jacket, black pants, blue eyes..etc. Then he turns the corner and gone. So we get to Upstairs--getting in the front door was easy bc a friend had dropped god knows how much for a table (bottle service...really, Wayne?...eugh). this got us into the \"ultra vip\" roped off area to the right of the DJ. we start pouring some drinks and dancing, until I realize (you must know where this is going), chase crawford is right behind me. I think i even spotted Michelle Trachtenberg out of the corner of my eye at their corner table. then, because I actually wanted to dance (shocking thing to do at a club, i know), I stepped out of the \"ultra vip\" section, only to try to make my way back in later and find myself faced with a *huge* bouncer in front of the \"ultra vip\" steps. I swear, the only word in the english language that he knew was \"NO.\" I convinced him to let me in only when I told him I was getting my coat to leave--which I promptly did. although entertaining, having a celebrity in a club makes everything 10 times more difficult than it needs to be. Hmmph. How rude! We certainly feel your pain, paying good money to be told by a security guard you cannot get back to your table. Bastards! That'll teach all of you, never, ever go dance. Ever.

He doesn't change his jeans because he is breaking them in over time. If you notice, the jeans are completely raw at the beginning and by the end they are distressed. Lots of people that are really into denim just wear one or two pairs for years at a time. The process creates an authentic wash. Not something sanded and treated with chemicals.

It's Friday. You're probably a little groggy from going out last night. You're eyes are blurry and blood shot, and they can only stay open for a few seconds to read this. We'll make it fast. Quick Hits! Qui Qui Qui Quick Hits!1. One of our favorite Little Birdy's checks in to let us know that after all this time, the Box is indeed still going strong, saying \"nice surprise performance by Mos Def at 330am...place isnt burnt out yet.\" Scandalous! Our LB also lets us know that Kiss and Fly is apparently kicking some ass, saying \"saturdays hv been hot\". Indeed.2. Some secret things have been going on behind the plywood at the new John Varvatos store on the Bowery. A LB reports, \"I saw a gaggle of pretty young things leaving the new Varvatos store (old CBGB) on Wednesday night. It looked like they were having a small party or something.\" How fun. 3. What's up with Steve Lewis trying to pigeon hole Jayma Cardosa during his gripping 3 part interview? Mr. Lewis repeatedly refers to the co-owner as \"the consummate Bottle Host\", despite her partners telling him that she is doing a bit more than that. Give the lady some respect. [GNML]

New York City has all kinds of clubs. Now it may really have them all. Introducing the Picnic Club, \"a members-only club dedicated to the enjoyment and promotion of the classic picnic\". When we first heard it, we really didn't believe it, so we reached out to them to get the skinny. Here's what club founders Allison and Mike told us:This is 100 percent real. We are planning to have our inaugural picnic in early May. The date and location have already been selected, and we will post the informationon our blog about a week before.We have carefully selected content for our blog which we will post every few days between now and the announcement date.We think that New Yorkers need to spend more time outside and think there is no better way to achieve this goal than to organize picnics. It is very much an underground, word of mouth, grassroots type operation but one that we feel could fundamentally change weekend afternoon activity in NYC and eradicate the misery that New Yorkers sometimes experience when they have a case of the Sunday Blues.We want this project to have a very lighthearted, egalitarian feel, and we can't wait to meet everyone. The goal is simple, the execution even simpler--come to our picnics, bring food and drinks, and have a great time meeting other like-minded people.Sounds pretty real to us. Unlike a few others, this is one members club we may have to join. Just don't ask us to bring potato salad.

Did you think we were going a whole week without Flyer Follies? You must be crazier than AstraGirl and Steve Lewis combined. A Double Dose coming up. Let's see. P.I.N.K. and Vitamin Water are sorta the JMZ going into Bushwick. And the Delancey Lounge is Midtown. And the L Train may not exist. This party is seriously messed up. But open bar on the Delancey Roof from 6-7 while it's 49 and sunny. Angels and ____. This one is almost too easy. Read the fine print and you see Trump Vodka is bringing the flavor tonight, so you know you are dealing with the finest ingredients, the hardest glass bottles, the classiest labels, and really bad vodka club sodas.

Ding Dong! Nicolette Goes to Suzie Wong's

***CONTENT
The results are unanimous. Our newest contributor Nicolette is a certified hit! One reader went so far to write, \"I want more Nicolette and the City!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\" Well, we want it too. And finally, we have it. Nicolette checked out Suzie Wong's and then booked it to old standby, Pink Elephant. Without further ado. . .I arrived at Suzie Wong’s, the new sake lounge on West 27th street, fairly early – 11:30 p.m. There wasn’t a line which was great, and I walked right in. There are a lot of VIP tables here but none are roped off, and the place is pretty small – which I love. The smaller the place the better. There is only one bar and wherever there isn’t a table, or on top of the banquette, is the unofficial dance floor. Peter and his friends showed up around 12ish and we danced and mingled at their table. When they bring you bottles they also give you fortune cookies to go with their oriental theme. My friend Cristina’s fortune cookie read “Suzie Wong Says: Don’t be afraid to go to the bathroom with a stranger” and Sue’s read “Suzie Wong says: Kiss the person next to you passionately”. Pretty corny but kind of cute, and it does help with potential hooking up at 3:00 a.m. We had complimentary apple sake shots that aren’t strong so the price was right. DJ Nick Cohen spinned hip hop and rock (what else?) all night, and the crowd was 25 and under. A lot of fun, and I would definitely go back. But it cleared out early.Since it was only 1:30, we went to Pink Elephant and met some friends who had a table. I love Pink Elephant! I always have the best time here! The only real competition this club has is Pink Elephant in The Hamptons, which makes Pink Elephant in Manhattan seem like an amateur’s night out. We walked in and the place was packed. They play house, house with a few words in it and then some more house. Everyone was dancing, drinking, and going crazy, making Suzie Wong seem like an elementary school playground. There are always a lot of people here and most importantly - a lot of hot people. I’ve spotted a few celebs here before, and in the Hamptons I’ve hung out at John Legend’s table and danced next to Victoria’s Secret model Karolina Kurkova. Everyone here has money and the Euro scene is big, but not as big as it use to be. Don’t worry if you’ve never been to Europe or aren’t fluent in any other language - Drinking & Dancing is universal in any language in any city.The night was the most fun I’ve had in awhile. Pink is still strict door, rude bouncers, and a little bit older (I’m 21, excluding the underage models, I was the youngest person here). But once you’re in, feel free to let loose because everyone is having fun- a lot of it.

I had to read the other commenter's replies to make sure everyone else thought this was as much of a joke. I feel like this a review targeted at people who have no reason to be in any bar/club/lounge/Burger King of Manhattan.

It was just six weeks ago that we basically declared Mansion to be ous't. Some disagreed. But we stand by our call. After a few months, the proof is now in the pudding. A very tall Little Birdy passed along this once in a lifetime offer from the fine folks from TONY, which proclaims:We know. The weekend's just ended, but you're already thinking about your next night out.Luckily, TONY Nightlife+ is here to help you in the planning. The free service brings Time Out New York listings and more to your mobile device. We're giving away 200 spots on the guestlist for the new ultra lounge Mansion New York (530 W 28th St between 10th and 11th Aves) this Thursday, April 3 with free admission for 100 lucky TONY Nightlife+ users and a friend. Just sign in or join TONY Nightlife+, then click the link to add Mansion to your favorite venues by Wednesday at noon.Plus, start adding friends to your profile and you'll automatically be entered into a competition to win one of five copies of the new \"Sessions\" double CD by legendary DJ and Detroit-based techno producer Carl Craig. The more friends you add by Wednesday, the more chances you'll have to win.All winners will be notified on Thursday morning.We don't know how anyone who enters can wait until Wednesday to find out if they won. Long Island and North Jersey's ERs are on alert, waiting for noth the winners and the losers. No offense to Time Out (who we love!), but seriously, this ultra lounge/danceateria/whatever has only been open a few months and is already resorting to magazine promotions. Not good. Not good at all. Stick a fork in it. Mansion is Ous't.

So, our so-called friends at Guest of Guest decided that just because we like baseball, all of a sudden we aren't cool. Well, that hurts. It really, really hurts. So even though we said we would never reveal who GofG is because that would be the act of a child, we changed our mind. So meet Guest of a Guest. That's her up there at a local bake sale back home. Her name is Jenny Witherspoon, she is from Indiana, went to Purdue, and is an environmental engineer here in New York. How earthy! She loves pop culture and socialites, so she got some friends together and decided to start her little website. Anonymous blogging kept you from knowing her, but we decided it's time to see her smiling face. She keeps us entertained all day and we are happy to call her our friend. Say hi Jenny, and please keep reading both of our sites!

Ever since nightlife scion Steve Lewis partnered with the good folks at JoonBug on Goodnight Mr. Lewis, we had been getting requests through intermediaries to do an interview. Finally, we relented on one condition. We got to run a sneak preview of it here first on our little site. Steve Lewis: When I was coming up during the day, working with Steve Rubell and Ian Schrager at Studio 54, they told me that they had an idea for doing something with computers that would sort of be an online diary. And I had all of this peanut butter in my mouth, a whole mouth full of peanut butter, and when I tried to speak, the only noise I could get out was \"brahg\". And Steve Rubell, who was a genius, said to me, \"yes a blog. That is exactly what I'm talking about. A blog.\" And so we actually came up with blogging then and there. And when I was running Life, I was doing everything, the door, the music, the design, making drinks, hailing cabs, blogging, the servers, and dancing. And that is sort of like Down By The Hipster, which I respect.DBTH: Well, there is a group of people helping out, and all of the readers, so it's tough to say that one person really does everything, but we understand the comparison. SL: When I did the door, I learned from the best. The best. And so when I blog and when someone like Rosie blogs, you know you are going to get some nouns, some verbs, some adjectives. Those are all some of the best parts of grammar. And you mix them together and create a successful sentence. And when I was running Life, you really only got a noun, but the noun was the best one with all different letters. So your posts are sort of like me naming the club Life. DBTH: Well, we do write about Danny A, and apparently he was a really big deal at Life, so we can see the connection. But in other ways, they really aren't anything alike.SL: Now, when I ran Life, we really only made money at the bars. These days you can make money with the tables, which I invented, and which are like little tiny bars. And by reading Down By The Hipster, which I haven't read by the way but I hear is great and doing all those things with the posts and the stories and pictures, it seems like you not only have the bar, the main point of sale, but also tables that are the second point of sale. So it's like your running your blog like I would have run a club, like Life, when I was still doing that. DBTH: Yeah, well, we try our hardest to run this like a business, and we cover nightclubs, so you can definitely see the similarities. That is just a little taste of what you will be seeing tomorrow on Goodnight Mr. Lewis. We thank Steve for taking the time to interview us and look forward to a long friendship.

Steve neglects to tell us that all of \"his\" joints were actually not his at all. Half of his clubs were owned by Maurice Brahms (Red Zone, Palace De Beaute, Life) and Peter Gatien (Tunnel, USA, Limelight)As far as I can recall, NONE of the aforementioned clubs ever served bottles so, I would love to know in which one of \"his\" clubs he introduced this club changing miracle.He lives in the past but, has a selective memory like forgetting things like being arrested and sent to prison, snorting coke and doing X with the club kids and smoking crack with his EX Wife all over the city.Why not interview the actual owners of the clubs rather than the managers and heads of the promotion department? Oh wait, they are either dead, in jail or have no interest in living in the past or talking with \"has beens\" like Mr. Lewis.PS All of these \"original club people\" are in their late 60's and 70's so I doubt they would have much to offer in 2008 anyway.

The poster above me is a real idiot. This was an April Fools joke!!! Lewis never said he invented bottle service DBTH was spoofing his ego in honor of April Fools..Moreover, why would I want to hear from the money men behind the clubs? I want to hear from the people who ran the door, walked the floor. With respect to the \"prison\" and \"drug\" cheapshots, so what. This is the club world. Those things just add to your rep, your credibility. It would be different if, let's say, our elected officials were committing crimes, doing drugs, sleeping around.Bottom line, how do you take any poster seriously when he/she can't see a joke right before their eyes. Happy April Fools Day fool.

The credit crisis has struck again. This week's victim is the Crown Las Vegas project, which was supposed to be the tallest building in the Western Hemisphere, but will no longer be built. Judging by the building design (vibrator anyone?), architecture fans will not be too sad, but what does it mean for John Q. Tourist? As the economy continues to soften, expect American's leisure travel to decline by the end of the year. Unlike the boutiques of Manhattan, Las Vegas is a bit too far for the average Londoner or other European to get away to for the weekend. Asian gamblers now have numerous options in Macao. Result? The desert resorts will surely suffer from a lack of visitors, share values will drop and a developer looking to get a chunk of land on the strip for cheap will pounce on a site like this and try and capitalize during the next boom. Scary times ahead for the hospitality industry. Scary times indeed.

Last night, those crazy kids from Converse (and Radar) decided to throw a little shimmy to celebrate their 1Hundred initiative, bringing artists from around the world together to fight HIV/AIDS. Good cause. Good party. The Open House Gallery on Mulberry Street was the spot, with Thurston Moore manning the decks for the first few hours. Heinekens and vodka were the drinks, and the space was set up for a user friendly experience, with party goers able to grab a marker and contribute their own drawings various walls and chucks scattered throughout the space. It allowed everyone to express deep hidden feelings and words that people are normally too reserved to share with the public. Or it mainly helped keep everyone away from the bars and food. Probably the latter.Anyway, the party was really quite fun. And it was for a good cause. And a lot of people got to take home Converse. So we say huzzah.

Bowery Electric, the new bar in the former Remote Lounge space, had its friends and family soft open last night. The official public opening is next week. The bar, which is owned by Mike Stuto of HiFi and Jesse Malin and Johnny T of Niagara and Black and White, broke out a velvet rope and clipboard mafia to keep the public out, a sign of what the Bowery has become. Sigh. Anywhoo, first reports have the space sparsely decorated, with a simple black and white motif inside. There are a few table spaces with wrap around banquet type seating arrangements, but judging from their other joints, this will definitely be a place to come and drink. What else would you want? Holla. Photo Credit

With all the recent hullabaloo over the reopening of Submercer and it's door policy, we thought we would remind everyone of a little place on West 12th Street that's got a pretty tough door of its own. While Submercer and Rose Bar offer an email address to plead your case, the Beatrice Inn offers you nothing. You are either on Angelo's list or you are not. And if you are, we remind you to respect the rules of the bathroom, which we have included in the image above. And if you can't, well you'll just have to find somewhere else to dance.Photo Credit

HUE for fuck's sake) ho-stess, and the only reason that young 20something ho with absolutely no prior writing experience at all managed to even get her story pitched to the Times in the first place was cuz choire-sicha was boinking frank-bruni at the time.that's some crazy shit right ??whatever. i'm just sayin.xoxoabbe diazPX This.p.s. $30 bucks a week ? i'll think about it. seriously.:)

Contrary to popular opinion, the three apartment buildings at 320-324 West 14th Street are not being converted into an André Balazs owned hotel. How do we know? Well, because we do. (What's up dude? What's up?) Anyway, a Little Birdy confirmed this, saying \"The rumors about the Balazs hotel are completely false. The Icon Development Group said there is no deal for any hotel. They plan to convert them to condos.\" There you have it. The apartments stay.. Is This the Site of André Balazs' Next Hotel? [Curbed]

The return of Submercer, the private lounge beneath the Mercer Hotel, downtown has yet another impossible door. How impossible? Well, the Grub Streeters tried to get a reservation and received this response:Thank you for your interest in the subMercer. Due to limited capacity, the subMercer is reservations only. Kindly let us know the time and date of your requested reservation, the number of people you wish to bring, your full contact information, and your relationship to the subMercer. Unfortunately we are not always able to accommodate requests, but we will notify you within 24 hours if it is possible to confirm your desired reservation.Thank yousubMercerWe aren't sure how anyone is related to a lounge, but it seems fair enough. But what strikes us is that this simple response goes way beyond what the reservationists at Ian Schrager's Rose Bar offer up. We can't tell you how many emails we get, begging us on tips to get inside the Gramercy Hotel's lounge, including this oldie but goody: Any tips on scoring a reservation at rose bar? They never seem to respond to emails.See, Submercer isn't that tough - at least they give you a fighting chance to make your case. If you haven't gotten inside Rose Bar, chances are, you just won't.

I can tell you from experience, Rose Bar/Syndicate has their email request system on a screener... if you email isn't in their database to begin with (or on the invited list), you're done from the get-go. In order to have my emails responded to, I had to pester the Syndicate folks to add my email to their computer system....RE: Submercer... it is all about who you know who works for either the bar or the parent company, plain and simple. If you come up empty there, you better hope that you were able to get into Beatrice, because Simonez is now doing the door at Submercer.

Since beatrice, rose, submercer, 1oak, etc are my regular watering holes, I'll offer this up: the only way to consistently get in to to know the staff, the managers, the doormen, and everyone inside. seeing as these places are tiny and packed with the same circles, not sure why random people want to party there anyway. the best thing about these bars is that its constantly packed with friends

Behold! A Continuous Lean supplies some quality images from the Rusty Knot, Ken Friedman and Taavo Somer's much discussed and admired nautical bar on the West Side Highway. ACL says, \"What we found when we arrived was pleasant (granted we went fairly early and on a Monday) and accommodating. No huge crowds, no bridge and tunnel. I suspect everyone in the bar was a blogger of some sort. At least from the quantity of coverage the “dive bar” has been receiving, that would be a logical assumption. We quickly managed to score one of the wooden booths (faux wood carvings and all) and got to work on some very well made Dark N’ Stormys served in tiki glasses. The menu was limited, but very well done.\" Here, here! But what follows is really the perfect description, \"I like to think of it more as working-class meets Threes Company. I was expecting to see Mr. Roper hanging out at the bar.\" Go and knock on their door. Dark N' Stormy in a Tiki GlassBar food. All photos courtesy of A Continuous Lean

Fresh off the recent raid of the PURE offices, the Las Vegas nightlife scene is preparing to deal with yet another legal battle. A Little Birdy writes, \"As crazy as it gets in NYC nightlife, Vegas still manages to take up the ante with the drama. Clubplanet's parent company is suing Angel Music Group who does parties at the MGM for $90 million. Charges include assault, death threats, stealing of employees and clients, etc.\" How do they know all of this? Well, blogger extraordinare Robin Leach has the scoop, breathlessly covering the matter in his Luxe Life blog. However, the post was so long and convuluted that we just gave up. We are asking one of you to keep us abreast of the situation - our heads hurt.

Momofuku Ssam bar, lauded for its great food served late into the night, has quietly shrunken it's late night menu. A visit on a recent Tuesday shows that the late night menu is, in fact, rather limited. Gone are most of the delicious menu items that require lengthy prep time, including the now banished dinner ssam burrito. What is available are items from the cold stations, hams, bread and butter, and some line items like pork buns etc that are lined up and only require assembly. It's disappointing that all of the items aren't available after 11, but don't fear, this limited late night menu is only in place from Sunday to Wednesday - after which the full menu, with all of its glorious Chang sauce, returns until closing. Mark your calendars accordingly.

We loved, loved, loved our first visit to the Rusty Knot. Good food, good music, good vibe. Just good. But in case you don't believe us, a Little Birdy filed a report, saying \" I was at RK last night for the after party for Run Fat Boy Run (Ed. Note: Last Thursday) and wanted to let you know the food was great, I sampled some meat pies, potato croquettes, coke a cola ribs, bbq shrimp, chick pea spread on a crouton, and a rocking Scottish egg. I was really impressed with the place but I am big on nautical themes, someone I was there with though said it reminded them of a bar on the Jersey shore.\" Sounds delicious, and since the the bar is on the river, we have to think that your friend's feeling means the design is doing it's thing. Thanks for the report.

Four weeks ago on a Thursday night we,my 2 girlfriends and my boyfriend trundled down to try the Rusty Knot.We are in the \"food\" industry so we had heard the hype and wanted to see for ourselves.First impressions were not good, we couldnt get in, as there was a line.But then we were greeted by a stylish Englishman who we now know as Gary, he told us that the wait wouldnt be long, and if it was, to go for a drink elsewhere and he would call us on our cell when he could accomodate us.Amazing, so simple yet, Id never had such service.When we did get in (the wait was like 15 mins) it was a mixed bag of suits and art people, good music, and we sampled the food ,but again only because Gary had managed to find us a table.We ate pretzel dogs, oysters and clams, all very well done, and neatly priced.Now ever since that first time each Thursday we have gone back, as we did last night.BUT....Gary is no longer there.We were told by the doorman that..\"he wasnt working tonite\" we were told by a bartender \"he doesnt work here anymore\" we overheard from another conversation that he had been fired ???I have yet to find out where he was, but what I will say is, the service was terrible, we couldnt get a table, and we left after 40 or so minutes.So, if you go to the Rusty Knot make sure Gary is working, he will make your night a lot more pleasurable than if he is not.

Antik, the new semi-speakeasy on the Bowery just opened last week, and already the place is generating all sorts of reviews by our faithful readers. What say thee - commneters?. WTF?? You cant get a drink in this place to save your life. Couldn't find a waitress and there is definitely no bar for patrons. Only for waitresses if you were lucky enough to find one. Found out later today when I was talking to some friends that this place doesn't have a liquor license or something and that's why you won't find a bar in Antique. Anyway not sure where those models were, but if they would have been there I might have been able to stay around longer and die of thirst!. This place sucks, definitely not hipster or cool. The people are whack, service is horrible, and models?? Who are they kidding? Obviously they are writing their own good comments on here.. I'm so sick of these \"speak easies\" that are being rolled out one after another. Would you like a honey infused, peppermint, pomegranate, ginger, fizz????!!Ouch, ouch and more ouch. That is not the way to open up. Because this is the site of a former bar, we are pretty sure that they are properly licensed. But it does seem like they are operating Kings Cross and Antik as two bars with cross access. We obviously need more information, and we think we know the right person.

Ah Submercer. We missed you buddy. In the door, past Simonez, down the elevator, down the hall, make a left, through the door, in the door on the right, down the hall, and through the door. Got it? Good. Walk inside and there you have it. Submercer. It's still small, it's still smoky, and it's still fun. That's right. Fun. The night was a celebration of Radar Entertainment's merger with Plug, and celebrate we did. Albert Hammond Jr.(the Strokes - Duh) manned the music for the early part of the evening, mixing in classic rock, 80's dance, and 60's soul expertly. No BS, everyone was having a great time. Drinks, dancing, cigarettes, whatever. It was good. So it's back. Submercer is back. But good luck getting in. This door is guaranteed to be tough. PS - Astragirl - there is your Submercer post. Sometimes you just have to be patient.

Some intial reviews of Antik are in, and we aren't sure what to make of it. One Little Birdy told us it was \"a shit show\", but a commenter says, \"I was there last night and there is definitely a bar, and a lot of models . The place although is incredible small. I think you should send Nicolette there on a recon mission and watch her mingle. This could make for a great new reality show.\" That may be a good idea. But it's now property of DBTH.3.

Hey everyone. DBTH here. Yesterday was a pretty exciting day around these parts. You probably didn't read it, but we happen to get a little bit of publicity that wasn't really expected. In fact it was pretty much out of left field. But then again, so is the writer, Ben Leventhal. That's him up there, with his partner, Lockhart Steele (real name). And together they manage the Curbed/Eater empire. Not a bad gig.It was just last Thursday that we were all invited guests for the opening of the Rusty Knot. We even spent some QT together, buying Lock a beer and watching his murse for hours. But while we enjoyed ourselves, Lil BL secretly seethed, desperate to know why anyone dared challenge his authority as the ultimate insider. But the anger and fear is justified. Sitting in that lonely FiDi apartment, seeing Grub Street, Guest of a Guest, and just about everyone else with access to the internet scoop him must drive him batty. Pinkberry, Momofuku and Shake Shack couldn't open enough locations to keep him on the inside. Frank Bruni only only takes him on review dinners every so often. So what is he to do? There was just one solution. Kill the threat. So BenBen dropped the froyo coverage for a bit and became an infantile gossip to out us - hoping the publicity would make us go away. He then let us know:\"for what it's worth, steele and i worked this one together, which is to say that it wasn't done willy-nilly.\"Well that's a relief. And you know we love teamwork. He then followed with some of the wisest words ever typed:\"anyway, it what it is. i just gave you more explanation that any one else gets, because you're a friend. don't do the blog if you can't be the guy.\"That's so sweet of you. Really we're touched.And to think, this is just a hobby. A labor of love if you will. No book deals and no JV's. We never ask for anything and don't get paid. We work hard to bring you this site and think we do a pretty good job. Traffic is growing (see graph), we found a great new contributor, and contrary to Ben's worthless opinion, no one here has tired of the grind. Usually that happens after 3 years, right buddy?We're just gonna keep on plugging away, one post at a time. That's how we do.Have a great weekend,DBTHPhoto Credit

Antik is open for business as of tonight - if you are on the invite list that is - and according to reports, there is no bar in the joint. Customers will be ordering all drinks from cocktail servers who will then pop back to a service bar where they will be made.Weird concept, since patrons who enjoy cocktails also enjoy speaking to the knowledgeable mixologists who create them. Call us crazy, but this is probably the final nail in the coffin of New York's speakeasy trend.

Our friends at ICrave have been very busy Midtown beavers. First, they design Highbar, the newest roof bar option from Greg Brier at 48th and 8th. Now, they have redesigned the Portland Square Hotel in Times Square and helped transform it into the Sanctuary Hotel. Our friends at Hotel Chatter had some intel on this last year, but when perusing the ICrave site, we came across the mockups for the stylish lobby and bar, which will allow guests to \"experience an atmosphere of tranquility and energy within the lobby's intimate alcoves, warming fireplaces, and hip lounge.\" Sounds cozy, especially if you are in Times Square and want to get a drink and sit next to a fireplace. Look for an opening early 2009.Images courtesy of ICrave

Nicolette Gets Touch'd Up

***CONTENT
As promised, brand new contributor Nicolette from Niolette and the City stops by Touch and lives to write about it. My first mistake of the evening was showing up to Touch at 12:30 a.m. (11:30 p.m. would be ideal). There was a line, I don’t even know if you would call it that, of people arguing their way into the club. Having no patience for this I texted my friend who had a table inside to come walk me in. When I walked to the front of the line the doorman was reprimanding a group of 3 guys for breaking the club world rules- showing up without any girls and one guy was wearing sneakers. The doorman then gave them a 3 second ultimatum to buy a table or get off the line. When it was my turn I told the doorman my deal-whose guest list I was on, me plus 3 girls. He comped me (most likely because I didn’t waste his time, was a girl and knew the rules) but not my three friends who had to pay a $20 cover.When you walk into Touch you can go to your right, a long narrow hallway or to your left where the bar is. Either way leads to the dance floor in the back of the club. My first choice was the long hallway to the dance floor. We stepped onto the dance floor and my initial thought – massive huge orgy without any air conditioning. Everyone was drunk, gyrating to the music and was going crazy. There were a few tables in the middle of the dance floor – not very “VIP” so skip it. Then there is an elevated stage that surrounds the dance floor against the wall with all VIP tables- and every single one was taken. The second floor is exclusive VIP with tables only and you need a bracelet to get upstairs. I did make it upstairs after a group of guys found me and my girls and invited us up for a drink. There I met DJ Omi who was spinning all night long – and is solely responsible for keeping me at Touch as long as I did (that and a few drinks). She played everything from Hip Hop to House to Rock. I would definitely see her spin again, she made the crowd go crazy and have so much energy. Overall Touch wasn’t as bad as my first thoughts were when I walked into the club. The location isn’t my favorite - west 52nd street between Broadway and 8th avenue. Touch is as club as you get - not a bar and not a lounge/club so if that is not your scene you are going to hate it. Would I go back? Yea I most likely will. I would say go with a big group of friends, buy the table (you know they are going to make you), pregame…a lot, and have a good night.

Um, not at all... my theory is that if you have to pay a cover, it's not the type of place I'd like to go. A true VIP NEVER pays, you're always on the guestlist.And speaking of trashy nightlife and club scenes, wtf with covering all of these guido-fest clubs, DBTH? I really miss the old DBTH blog that I love(d)-- the one that got all of the hot scoops about chic hotel and lounge openings, restaurant gossip, and waaay-before-the-rest scoops... I mean, you haven't even covered the secret reopening of SubMercer?!?!?C'mon, snap out of it!

its funny how all you people think you're so hipster but there's nothing worse than people who think they're too cool and judge others for being uncool. that in essence makes you more unhip then they are.it is interesting to hear about how others go out and where they go and what they experience. whether or not they're as insider or tapped in as you are is irrelevant. it's funny to hear about someone new to the city. i bet that not one of you were immediately going to bungalow 5 years ago your first month in the city walking in and giving armin a pound. get over yourselves.

Good luck, Nicolette. Hopefully you'll get sick of going to all of the lame mainstream clubs and investigate some cool, under-the-radar places soon enough.

Although, I wish Nicolette well; her general 'vibe' does not mesh with that of a true hipster vibe. And no offense to Nicolette, but the word \"Manhattan\" does have two T's in the middle that should be pronounced in some fashion. Now, with early roots in Jazz and fashion, the word/lifestyle of a 'hipster' is a bit more complex/underground than a romp around 'mainstream hot spots' in the city. A little Wiki search will reveal that \"in the 1990s and 2000s, the 1940s slang term hipster began being used in North American to describe young, well-educated urban middle class and upper class adults with leftist or liberal social and political views and interests in a non-mainstream fashion and cultural aesthetic. While definitions vary, the hipster scene is often associated with alternative music and \"indie\" culture (independent rock and independent film), and other non-mainstream products, such as vintage clothing, 1970s-era vinyl records, magazines such as Vice, Clash and Nylon and the Pitchfork Media music website. In North America, hipsters may dress in a campy or ironic manner, in which retro 1970s-style sportswear is mixed with Salvation Army store clothing. The social scene in some major cities is centered in a gentrified downtown area where DJ clubs, fair-trade coffee cafés, and organic restaurants sit side-by-side with thrift stores and working class taverns.\"With that being said, although I can appreciate a lot of girls want to be a 'Carrie' from SATC, it's a generation ahead of yours, and it's time to move forward. Evolution, independent thoughts & spirits are all good things. I would recommend finding some true 'hipster' interests for your yourself and your next blog post. Happy Hunting!

Beware ye drinkers who like to wrap up the night with a warm slice of cheesey pizza goodness. With rising wheat, dairy and fuel prices, a slice of New York pizza has jumped again. Expect to pay $2.75 for a plain slice from now on - meaning you will need a bit more money in your pocket at the end of the night to eat away that empty feeling of drunkenness.

An Evening At:  Death & Co.

***CONTENT
What is it about Death & Co. that drives the people so crazy? The regulars love it and want it to stay forever. The neighbors hate it and want it gone immediately. And where does that leave us? After visiting several times after it first opened, Death & Co. left us with a bad taste in our mouths. The food wasn't good, the seats were small, and the price point was, in our opinion, too high. We decided to stop going. But after almost a year, we decided to give it a chance. We showed up early in the evening to meet a friend, but when we told the door guard we were meeting someone, we had to wait outside in the cold until the rest of the party arrived. The next guests were told the same thing, saying the bar doesn't seat incomplete parties. Luckily, our party arrived before after a few minutes and we managed to get the last available small table. The other waiters never got in.The room is still dark and well designed. Jazz is still on as background music. The cocktail list is lengthy and varied, with several creative concoctions that were tasty, but took 10 minutes to be delivered to the table. We didn't eat, but the food we saw still came in excessively small batches. The size of the room, the crowd and the music make it very loud and hard to talk. Maybe not the best place to catch up with friends, but then what is it a good place for? We aren't sure.Do we want it be closed? Of course not. But we have our complaints. If it's a cocktail bar with food, then let people wait inside for their group. If it's too small, then allow people to reserve tables. The community issues have Death and Co. walking too fine a line, trying so hard to put it's restaurant foot forward while doing everything it can to operate as one of the most upscale cocktail lounges in town. No one can be everything. Death & Co. deserves a chance to do as it pleases, operating as a full service lounge until 4 AM, 7 nights a week. But that doesn't mean we are going to go.

sounds like this place is way more trouble than its worth. never been there before. i went by once and the guy outside with the list taking names was pretty rude. too many cool places to waste your time with one that is a pain in the ass.

Go to Death & Co if you're serious about cocktails. The bartenders are the best in the city and they treat mixology seriously. It's one of my favorite places because I know the other people there also have a lot of respect for the art. If you're the type of person that doesn't like bitters and thinks the Thomas Keller portions should be larger, don't go.

Unfortunately our trip to SXSW this weekend was unexpectedly called off. Luckily, a faithful Little Birdy filed a field report from Austin. There were supposed to be several, but the parties got the best of Birdy, so we have to settle for one. Birdy?Saturday was the last official night of South by Southwest and the festivities closed with a bang. Bands from around the world have performed all week with the festival taking over every venue with a floor and power outlet. And the hipsters were our in force. Think Beatrice Inn times 1000. This little birdy spent most of the evening at Perez Hilton's Perez Says event at the Palm Door and is feeling the effects today. Good news - open bar. Not so good news - open bar choices were 10cane or Navan. The band line-up was solid and there was even a Guitar Hero setup in the VIP. Cisco Adler and Schwaze made an appearance and were scheduled to perform but never did. N.E.R.D. capped off the night and the legendary Larry Tee DJ'ed in between the bands. Chromeo's Dave 1 stopped by late night after their performance down the street. That's what happens when you spend all night at Perez's party. You get f*cked. Anyway, bad Birdy for only 1 report, good Birdy for reporting. Any other stories? Let us know.

After the horrific crane accident this past weekend, the Times has an excellent article in memory of Fubar. Lacking fancy cocktails, gimmicks or pretense, Fubar was simply a neighborhood bar, and a much loved one at that. We wish the best for everyone involved.

An Evening At:  The Rusty Knot

***CONTENT
Last week, we took the opportunity to enjoy An Evening at the Rusty Knot, the high end nautical dive bar that Ken Friedman and Taavo Somer quietly opened for business in the old West Space. Walking in, you can't help but feel you've stumbled into the local bar in some rural town in Maine. Busch Beer on tap, box wine on the shelf, Tiki glasses, Spider Bowls, a killer juke box, pool table and furniture crafted from what seems like the remnants of the Love Boat set only enhance the mood. The space is tight, but capacity is only 75 or so, which should render any problems moot. Unless you are stuck outside that is. We stepped in and ordered a Rusty Knot, the refreshing house cocktail made from Rum, house sour mix, and mint, that went down smooth as sugar. A few stools opened up and our party settled down.The Knot isn't only a place to drink and stare at Jersey City. They also got some kick ass bar food. Oysters, peel and eat shrimp, classic shepard's pie, razor clams, giant pigs in a blanket. Bar food to the extreme. The best we had? How about a Chicken Liver, Bacon and Avocado sandwich that scream luxury even as you are sucking down a smooth drinking tap Busch. Aww yeah. The best news is that this can all be yours until 4 AM, 7 days a week. Look out Corner Bistro. Expect desire to experience this to be at a full burn as of tonight, so if you want to go, best get their early. Because once you get a seat, chances are you will be hanging at the Knot all night. Aye Aye.

So ...we get to the \"Knot\" this past Saturday, its around 10.30pm on arrival we are greeted by a thick set doorguy who tells us its busy and that the host will be out to explain.5 minutes later a very charming English guy appears to tell us that it is \"busy at the moment and that we can either call back in 30 minutes or so. or he will call us on our cell phone \" WOW...Is this too good to be true for a \"dive\" bar ???NO..My boyfriend gets a call from the host on his cell we are invited to the bar as \"we have room now \"So..We go in...It is busy but not crazy saturday night busy...we wait for a waitress, and wait, and wait ???So we go to the bar..Drinks are very good, apparently we are too late for food (its now 12 something )The service inside was generally poor, I overheard a girl delighting in the fact that she was the \"manager\"...well in that case then take our god damn drink order !!!..Summing up....Great host service , good drinks, nice atmosphere, juke box has ecletic mix, old and new stuff, and its FREE...oh and theres a pool table...which our boyfriends made good use of as we girls talked handbagsGive it a try, hope u get served better

Four weeks ago on a Thursday night we,my 2 girlfriends and my boyfriend trundled down to try the Rusty Knot.We are in the \"food\" industry so we had heard the hype and wanted to see for ourselves.First impressions were not good, we couldnt get in, as there was a line.But then we were greeted by a stylish Englishman who we now know as Gary, he told us that the wait wouldnt be long, and if it was, to go for a drink elsewhere and he would call us on our cell when he could accomodate us.Amazing, so simple yet, Id never had such service.When we did get in (the wait was like 15 mins) it was a mixed bag of suits and art people, good music, and we sampled the food ,but again only because Gary had managed to find us a table.We ate pretzel dogs, oysters and clams, all very well done, and neatly priced.Now ever since that first time each Thursday we have gone back, as we did last night.BUT....Gary is no longer there.We were told by the doorman that..\"he wasnt working tonite\" we were told by a bartender \"he doesnt work here anymore\" we overheard from another conversation that he had been fired ???I have yet to find out where he was, but what I will say is, the service was terrible, we couldnt get a table, and we left after 40 or so minutes.So, if you go to the Rusty Knot make sure Gary is working, he will make your night a lot more pleasurable than if he is not.

The place now seems very disorganized and out of control to me. My girlfriends and I had been there a few times after it opened, and we found it to be a lot of fun, because the British guy at the entrance knew what he was doing. Pleasant, polite, efficient, and always knew how to make the crowd waiting outside to feel ok. Once we were inside, he made sure we were being well taken care of. He checked on pretty much everybody and with a smile and a witty comment.We went back there a week ago, and it just didn't feel the same. There was nobody to greet us.Just your usual bouncer! What's up with that? Having an efficient host is key. The service inside was awful. We called one of the managers to ask about the British guy and complain that nobody had taken our order, and she said that she was sorry but they were overwhelmed at the moment with too many guests. She seemed very annoyed that we suggested that they needed good people working there. And got furious at us when the suggestion went back to the Englishman who no longer was there to manage the flow in a smooth way. She replied: \"Why does everybody keep asking about him?\" And left us waiting. AGAIN!Not worth it!Too bad. Why change something that was working so well? We won't bother going there anymore. The feeling and atmosphere completely changed!Really not worth the wait outside.

Thanks to a fast moving Little Birdy, we can drop some additional intel on the soon to open Antik. According to the LB, \"It is the latest creation from nightlife impresarios Larry Kramer and Craig Koenig, the team behind the rustic-lounge Retreat.\" Now, R&R was not half bad during its short run, but Retreat? We are having trouble coming up with something nice to say. Best to just leave it alone. Overall, impresarios may be a little too strong of a word here.Bonus note: The late M&R bar has also been renovated into King's Cross Tavern, which fancies itself as an English pub of sorts. It's been open for a few weeks now, with some early intel making it sound not half bad. We also hear that they have been letting people upstairs into Antik, even though it's not open yet. Stop by tonight and let us know how it goes.

Hey DBTH I went to antik on tues night and is seems as if it is all bottle service. the crowd was mostly promoters with some people dressed in wedding gowns (after party??) mostly models and hipsters... I think they are trying to keep it ultra exclusive as the space is small and the bar looks more like a coat check.

Bowery Row is set for a new addition to its already plentiful nightlife menu. The old Marion's Continental has quietly undergone some interior renovations and is about ready to reopen as Antik. There has been next to no news about this, but the fancy Zagat folks have heard that Antik will be \"a 'semi-private' cocktail lounge\". Joy. And judging by the logo, we can imagine the bar will have some sort of dark and sexy motif. No word if it is connected to Hostler Burrows Antik Gallery. Most importantly, when does it open? DBTH has heard rumors of Wednesday, March 19th, but that is unconfirmed. Since it's semi-private, we doubt any of us are invited, but we're working on correcting that.Much more to come.

Goodnight Mr. Lewis is quickly becoming the greatest thing that has ever happened to DBTH in our entire lives. It turns out that maybe he sorta kinda possibly knew Spitzer's lady of the night, but his friend's sure did. Let's let Steve explain:It's 3 am, I'm in a club and a friend of mine is having a text message marathon with none other than Ashley Alexandra Dupre' our ex-Governor's special friend. \"You know her, \" I was told a couple dozen times, but I really can't remember... Everybody was talking Ashley last night. What is true and what is false, I cannot say for sure, but here's what I heard...Michael James, 3 Pink Vodka and Sodas in to my conversation with him made me swear to keep his name out of this , so I will. A shortish, always tanned girl with a killer body, she was always rolling with ballers and always talking about her career in music. Indeed one doorman said the last couple times he had seen her she was rolling with P Diddy's crew. Friends who had \"been\" there said it all makes sense now, that apartment at the Landmark on 6th Ave., the trip to St. Tropez this summer, the vacations by private jet. She was shacked up with someone else famous this past summer. Two different people chuckled, but wouldn't give me more. There was that someone else in St. Tropez on a boat, I guess the one in the photo.Part of P. Diddy and the Governor's crew. Talk about ballin. And we love the Steve wouldn't sell out, keeping it for the site to keep his JoonBug overlords happy. Onward.. One Degree of Separation [GNML]

After announcing a fourth Monday evening party, Star Lounge's little gittee up, one of our lovely commenters deftly explained the scene like this:\"Butter\" is like the NWA of Monday Night Parties, The O.G. if you will. \"Utah's\" and \"Upstairs\" are like Snoop Dog and Dr. Dre.. \"Star Rm\"? More like Vanilla Ice...Everyone follow that? Good. So with 4 parties already established on Monday, can the City possibly support one more? We will find out soon, as a Little Birdy has told us that the Hudson Hotel in Midtown will be launching their very own Monday night soirée, very exclusive, very media and arts centric. Apparently it starts next week, so check back next week for the exciting conclusion.

We got some interesting gossip from a Little LA Birdy. Even though the contracts aren't finalized on their much hyped Atlantic City deal, the Beatrice Inn gang may be looking to the coast for their next project. Our LLAB says, \"Been hearing that Paul is looking to open a new spot in Los Angeles. Don't think it will be a Beatrice, but similar vibe.\" There you have it. We really doubt that it will be another Beatrice, which of course takes the name of the old restaurant that occupied the same space. And as a wise and successful operator once told us, \"your brand is your brand, and never do anything to jeapordize that\". Very wise words that everyone should take to heart.

Tucked into Part 3 of Mr. Lewis's 3 part interview with Mr. Upstairs, Danny A, the super promoter explains why he is bored with New York City nightlife, saying If I look at the whole club scene today, I have to tell you it’s horrendous. There’s nothing going on over here. I wouldn’t go anywhere and enjoy myself in New York now. Enjoying it is one thing, I can enjoy myself anywhere because I have people that I care about around me, but if I was a twenty-three year old guy coming to NY wanting to make myself in this scene and see who’s hot and who’s not…I remember going into a club twenty years ago and saying wow, I can’t believe it. What is there for shock value now? I’m talking about walking into the Tunnel on Friday and there are people dressed up like clowns and the room upstairs, hot crowd, all that back then, you could be in the VIP room and walk out onto the dance floor and you knew everybody. Today I walk through the dance floor only so I can get where I need to go. I don’t think I’m better than anybody else, but they’re there for a different reason than I am, they just pay twenty dollars and they’re just standing around, macho acting…We agree and disagree. There isn't much going on around here, but it's not for a lack of shock value. Things change over 10 years, and seeing clowns, gospel choirs and double dutch shows at the Box really don't cut it. Customers are paying over the top prices to enjoy themselves, so what's lacking isn't the shock - it's the fun and service that justifies laying out all of those greenbacks. No wonder the folks in London are going so hard these days - their currency is actually worth a damn.Also worth noting, our pals at Guest of a Guest snagged an interview with Steve Lewis, the man, the myth, the legend, and he gives DBTH a little shout out. Go give it a read.

From a Little Birdy:I just got back from Johnny Utah’s, as per your recommendation. On my trip back downtown I am pretty sure I had the exact same cabbie as you did in the recent Socilista posting. He began telling me and my friend stories about NYC night life, and dare I say, perhaps knew his stuff better than you.[Ed. Note: Impossible] I asked him if he happened to be the same cab driver. Turns out he doesn’t have a computer but he did say he never gives out his “fucking number” and that he tells everyone the same Socilista story, so it was probably him. Btw, turns out he doesn’t give his number out because people always call when he is busy and he doesn’t need the business then, so no harsh feelings. Its funny I stumbled across him; you definitely should try to get him on board. He says that he has been approached by club owners to sign up because of how much he knows, but he is happy as is so good luck.What a coincidence! This has to be the #1 nightlife cab driver in the City hands down. Doesn't this deserve some kind of recognition from The New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission?

Sorry to interrupt the Spitzer lovefest, but apparently there is a new party that is getting underway tonight. A Facebook promoter just sent out an email blast, saying Sorry for the late invite, but tonight (Monday) I will be @ Star Lounge ( 23rd St bet 7-8th ave @ the bottom of the Chelsea Hotel) this is a new party and its amazing, its strictly New York nothing but elegance and style, everyone needs to check this out. We have withheld any names from this, since we know how everyone feels about that. But what is it about Monday's that gets everyone's juices flowing? You now have Butter, Johnny Utah's, Upstairs, and newcomer Star Lounge all fighting for your early week dollars. But can anyone tell us what really is the best way to make yourself hungover with 4 more work days to go? We bet YOU can.

We would like to call to your attention a neat new service called Outalot, which allows for easy searching and mapping of restaurants, bars and various other items by category or neighborhood in a social networking sorta way. According to the intro email:Outalot is a location-based guide, available now for just New York City, that makes it easy for users to find nearby restaurants, bars, and movie theaters. It's available online, on iPhones, and on other mobile phones.You can rate, comment, and tag places in Outalot. You can also \"bookmark\" favorite places around town and share them with your friends. Think of the service as social bookmarking, but for physical places rather than URLs. After a few test runs, it seems they still don't have every single listing in Manhattan, but they are working out the kinks. Happy searching.

It's an early party at Johnny Utah's from about i would say....10ish to 2ish?? I've left 1:30 both times when it was slowing down and headed to upstairs (which i saw most of the people from there at after).\" Don't believe them? Luckily, they supplied a fancy video that shows the wild times. Fabolous. As an aside, our lovely cabbie also told us that Upstairs biggest night is Monday, after everyone leaves Butter. Could it also be filled with people from Johnny U's? Apparently.

Last night, Eater had the first details of BLVD being closed by the Department of Health. We received an email from the promoter that night giving details of what exactly went down. It's lengthy, but who are we to edit? According to the promoter of the event:To all that attended 2080s, or were planning on attending...I will begin this by apologizing for the inconvenience that occurred this past Friday night, February 29th. The turn of events left me feeling completely helpless and disappointed that so many were leaving let down.At 11:00pm as DJ Mel has just began his set, a member of BLVD's staff told him to reduce the volume as NYPD had entered the venue. At least 10 of them had shown up and at that point we had no clue why they were there. For the next hour or so, with the volume low, many guests had filled the club and were continuing to hangout, drink, and settle in. At this point, I still had no proper explanation at what was going on. Rumors ranged from Caberet licensing to NYPD's dislike for the club's management. Then at 12:20am, the BLVD's sound man announced that the club would be closing and the party would be ending, before it ever began. Mel never really played a record, Scene hadn't even put his records down, and Talib was still in a cab on the way over.By the time the club was shutdown, over 350 people had entered BLVD, and at no point was I told by club staff or NYPD that the party would be shut down. Everyone was under the impression that the cops were there for a routine check-up. I was told a number of times that they would be there for only 15 minutes, 5 minutes, not much longer, etc. And at this time, I'm still not 100% sure why the venue was shut down. All I know is that the sticker that you see above was on the club door as I left.I have yet to meet with club management but will do so this week. After that meeting, I will send out a conclusive message detailing the various issues. I will ensure you that those who of you who had RSVPed for the event, via email or Facebook, will receive free admission when we make up this event. I promise you that we will. I've already spoken to Talib Kweli, Mel and Scene, and all are looking forward to recreating this event. I'm sorry to those who have asked for refunds. We cannot give refunds because we have no proper way of accounting who paid what, who actually paid, and who actually attended; in addition to the fact that all artists still had to be paid. There is no way to express my grief at how incredible of an event last friday would've been under normal circumstances. Even the sleet, snow, and rain didn't keep people away!I will address the scenario regarding the \"make-up\" date as soon as all party and venue details are confirmed. Thank you for your understanding and support. We've worked over a month between promoters, friends, and family in the creation of 2080s. We will not let everyone's effort go to waste.For those of you who had made table reservations and purchased bottles, please contact BLVD to request a refund.Please pass this message on to everyone you know who attended 2080s this past Friday, February 29th at BLVD.With much appreciation,Kunal Merchant There you have it. Nice of them to offer refunds to everyone, and you can be sure we will have details of the next event.

Breaking news across the birdy wire. New York State Attorney General Andrew Cuomo is accused of Tonic East, Murray Hill's brightest, baddest and most roof decky sports bar pub club, of racial discrimination! Our Little Birdy passed along a high level summary of the charges:People of the State of New York; Andrew Cuomo v. 411 Rest. Corp. dba Tonic East3/3/2008 CV-2088Racial discrimination arising from defendant instituting a dress code excluding \"Hip-hop\" clothing or \"Urban Wear\" as part of a pattern or practice of denying African-Americans from admittance into its club TONIC EAST. We couldn't find any written dress code on the club's website, but in their photos, we were able to find one African American (sans Hip-hop clothing or Urban Wear). Call us crazy, but the picture reeks of photoshop. Anyway, we doubt that the \"but look at our Tonic Crowd photos, there is one African American up there\" defense is going to get them off the hook.Developing.

I, regretfuly, went to the Tonic in Times Square a few years ago. It was an early summer evening, and I hadn't planned on going there. In any event, I was wearing shorts and sneakers. We sat at the bar for at least 2 hours. At some point, I left to grab some cash at a neighboring ATM. When I came back to the bar, the bouncer refused to let me in sighting the shorts and sneakers and against their dress code. It took some pleading and explanation that my bag was sitting on a barstool within sight to get them to let me back in. I handed my friend some cash, grabbed my bag, and headed back to Brooklyn. My feeling on the way in was confirmed on my way out. The place sucks and is run by a-holes. Oh, and I'm white. No racial profiling there. Maybe it's because I'm gay?

There are thousands of cabs in Manhattan, but last night we stepped into the best. After giving our driver our cross streets, not only did he speak New York English, but also knew what was at that address. Our cabbie then began to regale us with stories about New York City nightlife, both past and present, and by the end we wanted to hire him to join this here site.One of the most interesting tales we heard involved Socialista, Armin's snazzy little Cuban joint in the far West Village. According to our cabbie, even before the Hep A incident, Socialista was having trouble drawing the nightlife elite. It wasn't because of the location, the tight door, or the prices (although they probably all contribute), but because Armin ran such a clean joint. He has actively kept any known drug dealers out of the club, which means that his customers who dabble in that thing either choose not to come, or have to leave when the booze starts to make them sleepy. The club was in trouble before that, and this Hep A scare will either be the nail in the coffin or a real wake up call for him to change his ways.Now, this was just the story that our cabbie told us. But the guy knew his stuff. A lot of stuff. And from our experiences at Socialista, the place is definitely on the level. But we will let you our readers make up your own mind. And don't feel too bad for Armin, Harvey W. and Cirpriani - we know a few hotel guys that would probably be happy to take that lease off their hands. And when we asked the cabbie for his card, he politely told us \"no\", saying \"you either already have it or you get lucky enough to get in my cab.

So let's get this straight......according to a cab driver you can't make a go of it if you don't let the dealers into your establishment and if you run a \"clean\" joint you can't be sucessful???????How about if you serve great food and beverage in a location that works and get the right people to not only come but return as customers, then you have a business that may actually make it to it's first year anniversary. How many of the so called hot spots of the day make it even 5 years????????

Reminds me of the very interesting american cab driver I had a couple of years ago who told me he did 10 years in jail for coke dealing, how he used to deal at studio 54, and how Ian Schrager got his nightlife and financial start doing the same thing.That's why I love talking to cabbies: no end to the good stories!

Maybe only fascinating to us, but Hotels Magazine has a nice little podcast interview with Sir Ian Schrager, who openly discusses his Edition Hotels partnership with Marriott. Some of the major highlights:. There are currently 9 hotels under development now, with 30 expected to be in the planning phase by the end of 2008.. Marriott's goal is to get at least 100 Edition hotels within 5 years, but Schrager would love to get at least 300 or 400. As many as possible.. Each hotel will be extremely unique, with a different design company being responsible for a different Edition.. For the first time Schrager's company may choose to operate the restaurant spaces within the properties, rather than outsource them as he has previously done. Ian says he has a ton of different concepts they could roll out.. Each Edition will be as green as possibleThis really is a fascinating idea that will either prove to be extremely successful or a tremendous bust. At no other time has a single entity sought to create a line of hotels that are all completely different. We wonder how one relatively small firm such as Schrager's, despite the power of Marriott behind it, can really expect to source, develop and market 100+ properties around the globe. But we certainly wouldn't want to bet against this guy. [Photo Credit]

***CONTENT
In a stunning move, the owners of the soon to open Chelsea Hotel in Atlantic City have tapped Paul Sevigny and Matt Abramcyk of the Beatrice Inn to oversee the nightlife operations at what they have dubbed \"The Fifth Floor\". If the parties can come to terms, the downtown duo will be \"booking D.J.s, making a menu of specialty cocktails and bringing 'a vibe',\" [EN: Heh], while also being asked to bring some of their celebrity friends. The Chelsea is certainly reaching for the gold ring, but will bringing the operators from the downtown club bring hipster success to AC? Opinions vary, from \"of course\" (Chelsea Hotel Owners), \"Maybe but it's not really hip because they are duplicating their flagship\" (AC Expert) to \"It will be successful, but only on the weekends\" (Hotel Expert).So what do we think? Well, when Allen asked us to comment, we responded that while Atlantic City is certainly headed in the right direction, there is just too much competition to bring it to the pinnacle of the hipster mountain. Even more important, if the Chelsea ever wants to see a return on their investment, their plans better be more developed than getting hipsters to come and drink. These guys need a dynamite hotel product, excellent service, and a way to get bodies into the beach town's only new hotel that lacks gaming all 12 months of the year. Unfortunately, our quotes weren't used. Too bad for us. But maybe we could've helped get the reporter past the Beatrice's bouncers. . Soho Meets HoJo in Atlantic City [NY Times]

Here's the most blatant example of why hipsters may not be so bad. Captain Nick Denton has the scoop on a super catty cat fight from the Beatrice Inn, featuring Hud Morgan of Men's Vogue and Spencer Morgan of the Observer. According to Nickita, the argument went like this:Spencer: \"Dude, why didn't you respond to my email?\" (He had apologized for the insult to Hud's teen girlfriend.)Hud: \"Do you want me to drop you?\"Spencer: \"Yeah, sure. That's a good idea.\"Hud walks down the stairs. Spencer follows, slaps him, later telling friends: \"He needed a dose of reality.\"Hud: \"He punched me!\"Bouncers escort Spencer to the side room to the right of the entrance, with the couches. Close scene.How utterly lame! So when you see a group of tight pants'd, blow dried, parakeet toting hipsters drinking a West 12th and dancing to Hall and Oates, remember, anything's better than uppity journalists. [Photo Credit]

The Belgian Room is a restaurant. They neither sell to \"kids\" nor do they intend to. The bar was fooled by underage police cadets posing as people older than they are. A bartender made a mistake and didn't check the ID of the person who went into the restroom while his friend bought a couple of beers

We hold out hopes that they do though. DBTH prayers are with you. [Photo Credit]

Hold the phones! Has everything we've heard so far about Mansion been wrong? Can it possibly be the \"force capable of leading clubdom to a new era.\" A Little Birdy reports: I went on Saturday night, in short it was not as horrible as I might have otherwise thought. Due to the sheer size of the space to fill it up they cannot be particularly discerning with who they let in so it ended up being a mix of a reasonably good crowd combined with a lot of bridge and tunnel. Seemed like two worlds clashing, but everyone was in good spirits and the somewhat silly decor was easy to overlook. The venue did eventually get packed circa 1 - 2 AM. I think the place will do well enough, (it's an upgrade from the sad state Crobar was in anyhow) if only as a fall-back for people who cannot get into the smaller venues on club row. Well, that's the best independent review we've seen so far, and it still doesn't come across as the Per Se of nightclubs. Maybe given some time, this puppy has a chance at success.

GNML sits down with Noah Tepperberg (Strategic Group, Marquee) for another magical interview. What did we find most interesting? Noah and Jason's ability to horizontally integrate clients into their properties across the country, saying Every client counts. To build a business that will sustain itself over a few years you have to have a loyal customer base that will come every week or every month or every six months and support your venue. If our customers are loyal and good, we make it a point to cater to them and bring them into this Marquee, Tao, Strategic, Dune, network. They have access to the network and can use it when they need to entertain clients or to travel. It’s a very key part to why our business works. 12 months a year in every large US city, Noah and Jason are able to plug you in to a Strategic related property. This in turn gives them longevity. This is why you see a place like Marquee remain open and going strong this far into it's lifetime.

I guess he has another title besides the worlds longest running club promoter!\" There is no shame in showing a visiting friend a good time, as long as it doesn't end up with all of you getting interrogated by Johnny 5. Just proves no one is above the traffic law here. The power couple was allowed to leave after 20 minutes.

We love to talk Manhattan hotels around here, with their numerous roof bars, glitzy restuarants, spas, and over the top design. But all that luxury comes with a steep price. Today, we take you in a different direction. Behold the Village Inn, a brand spanking new hostel on East 7th Street, just a few doors down from McSorley's. Hostels.net has the intel:The Village Inn is a totally renovated 5 story walk-up building that can comfortably accommodate travelers looking for the fun and history of the neighborhood. The dormitory rooms can sleep 8 to 12 people, and they all have private facilities. Private rooms are also available for those who demand a little more privacy. Next to our fully equipped kitchen, a flat screen TV entertains our guests in a large common area. Here, guests wake up to our well known \"two thumbs up\" free continental breakfast, an assortment of bagels, muffins, fruits, cereal, coffee, milk and orange juice. In our lounge, you can watch TV while you check your emails, lock up your luggage, wash your clothes, or just chill with other fellow travelers.Prices range from about $40 - $50 a night, depending on if you go private suite or dorm room. Since you are going hostel, we suggest going whole ham and shacking up with the rest of your new friends from Belgium. Happy hosteling.

We don't know how we missed this, but EuEu and BirBir got their little pad in the Hamptons, ingeniously named the Estate, a spiffy little write up in February. Makes sense to us. The 8 bedroom Sag Harbor estate isn't a party house, but a place to relax. And despite operating Tenjune and all that goes along with the EM Group, EuEu explains that they \"get to be here all the time.\" So it makes sense that the authors describe the house as feeling \"largely unlived in\" and \"lots of space waiting to be filled.\" Because that's what happens when you get Pottery Barn to decorate the whole place for free. Well boys, you know where to send our invitation for the summer.On a side note. Shame. Shame on all of your faithful readers for not sending this our way last week. It took 10 days for us to see it, and now we seem behind. SHAME.

A warning to those interested in visiting the new Chelsea Hotel in Atlantic City. It seems there already is a Chelsea Hotel in Atlantic City, except this one doesn't feature Stephen Starr restaurants or a super happening swimming pool. So what does it have? \"The Chelsea Pub and Hotel is an eclectic Victorian located a block from the Atlantic City boardwalk and 1/4 block form the Tropicana Casino. The property features large rooms with private baths that sleep up to four people. A friendly pub is located on site with knowledgeable local bartenders and great food. The Chelsea has free lighted parking adjacent to the property.\" While the friendly pub doesn't seem to compare to the Fifth Floor, we do like the sound of free lighted parking, which is especially key in Atlantic City at night. Please double confirm that you choose the proper Chelsea Hotel before booking.

It is very amusing to have two hotels named \"Chelsea\" within a city block of each other. Atlantic City must be running out of creative energies. Check out my <A HREF=\"<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://cityofatlantic.wordpress.com/2008/02/23/move-over-water-club-here-comes-the-chelsea/\"\">http://cityofatlantic.wordpress.com/2008/02/23/move-over-water-club-here-comes-the-chelsea/\" REL=\"nofollow\"> blog post on The Chelsea Hotel. The Chelsea Pub is a nice place where locals and casino shift workers congregate.

Run to the store and gather the bare necessities. Put bars on the windows, add another dead bolt to the door and perhaps look into hiring some private security. Apparently, there's a turf war that has broken out between New York City's most important nightlife characters, and they are taking no prisoners! It's 27th Street vs. Meatpacking District, and the winner will take all. How do we know all this? New nightlife blog Goodnight Mr. Lewis brings us this breaking news in an interview with Carlo Seneca, co-owner of Prime and Suzie Wong. Let's go to the transcript:Steve Lewis: Your competition is really the Meatpacking District. It’s the clash of the titans: Chelsea against MeatpackingCarlo Seneca: Exactly, we wanna pull as many people as we can out of there. I believe that Meatpacking is becoming too commercialized. The revitalization of this neighborhood is happening with Mansion and us at Suzie Wong and Prime leading the way.Wow. Thanks for pointing that out. Who knew that the Meatpacking District had become so mersh that 27th Street would be able to bring some real authenticity back? Certainly not us. Probably not anyone. With re-zonings, rising rents, and a general lack of interest, both of these areas will be virtually nightlife free within 5 years. But for now, please choose a side and keep your head on a swivel for flying lemon drop shots. [Photo Credit]

So maybe the Hamptons aren't your scene. Believe us, we understand. Perhaps Atlantic City is more your scene? If so, may we direct you to the newly launched website of the Chelsea Atlantic City - the first boutique hotel without gaming to open in AC. Featuring two Steven Starr restaurants, party pool and kitschy design, the real summer draw will be the Fifth Floor, described as Like a delightfully unpredictable house party, guests can roam from room to room endlessly exploring a flowing space punctuated with nooks, crannies, and hotspots such as the Terrace Lounge, the “must go” location for the over-21 crowd on the lookout for a sophisticated, hip experience outside of the casinos, the Living Room, the Bar, and the Game Room. Very interesting concept - but is it enough to bring guests to a hotel that lacks a gaming floor? We say yes - as AC suffers from a lack of quality hotel space to draw weekend guests. The Chelsea positions itself as a serious contender for the young and affluent who are more than willing to hop in a cab and pop over to the Borgata for gambling, MurMur, and Mixx. Apparently opens for Memorial Day. Book now!

Having just spent a whirl-wind 24 hours in AC, let's set the record straight: once you sort through the Jersey trash, there are three things to do in AC. Gamble. Strip Clubs. and Eat. Who the fuck is going to go to a hotel which offers only food?And also a worry to unsuspecting visitors (and perhaps this hotel's trademark legal counsel) is this little gem I found http://www.bedandbreakfast.com/new-jersey-atlantic-city-thechelseahotel.htmlUnfortunately, I couldn't snap a photo of the exterior.

Cape May is not AC. The \"New\" Chelsea will be hot for two months and then die a fast death. It's not for lack of effort or presentation, but well heeled tourists will not put up with filthy beaches and boardwalk that the city fails to maintain. The area around the \"new\" Chelsea is deplorable to most humans that do not reside in AC. How hard or costly is it to clean?

The comments on this board are obnoxious. The Chelsea Hotel is beautiful. I had a blast at the opening party, and the Chelsea Prime Restaurant has been booked since it opened. Atlantic City haters don't really understand that \"Atlantic City\" is much more than the Casino District in the city proper. Take a drive to Margate and Longport and see where the wealthy Philadelphians spend their summers. The Atlantic City area is a boater's paradise with many exclusive private country clubs and public golf courses on the mainland. I guess you don't know what you don't know, but shut your traps if you think Atlantic City is just the casino area. Stupid and misinformed. It's like driving to Bronx and saying New York blows. Even though the small shore towns have different names they are still considered by locals to be Atlantic City. FYI the boardwalk south of the Bally's is the nice portion. The boardwalk North of the Bally's can be rough, even though the Casinos are still nice up there. Blanket statements about AC are very annoying since it mischaracterizes a beautiful area based on the opinions of people walking around the Casino District while ignoring the nearby town in Brigantine, Ventnor, Margate, Longport, and Ocean City. These town are all part of the Atlantic City area.

Cool Mommy Alert!!!! I 'm a loyal NJ resident who works in the fashion industry in NYC while my husband works in the AC area. I stay in the AC area 30-40 nights a year at a variety of area hotels and casinos, most often at the Borgata. I had a great experience at The Chelsea when I stayed there the first week of August (before Chelsea Prime opened) and I am staying again next week. Though some of the services, like internet accessability for guests, were not available, and others like the pool area bar were evolving, the staff was very helpful and professional, the beds comfy and the bathroom product Kiehl's. The owners will probably hate this but I really recommend this place to families. This is the best looking hotel in the area that has an outdoor pool suitable for children and has safe, clean and quite crowded beach area.

Haven't locked up your summer share in the Hamptons yet? Don't sweat it. DBTH has a deal for you. And it's a doozy. For a small fee, you the get the house, the sun, the pool, the people, and the fun. Standard stuff. The real kicker? The party tent. That's right, this share includes a permanent party tent (pictured above). It's the summer share that you never have to leave, skipping the club life for the house club life. Thankfully, our faithful house organizers have included several action shots of last summer's housemates living it up - Acapulco steez. We highly recommend clicking through to the full flash presentation. Quarter and half shares available, but please act soon.

Big news from the desert. Pure Management Group managing partners Steve Davidovici and Robert Frey homes and corporate offices were raided by the IRS. According to reports, the bust went down just hours before a party for Bette Midler (tragic!), and the focus is apparently on the huge tips that the doormen collect from tourists who are beyond desperate to get inside Las Vegas's biggest club. There are rumors that doormen are making between $8 - $10 grand a night, which is some serious cake. Man about town Robin Leach also reports that the club owners are willing to cooperate in order to protect their celebrity investors (Shaq, Celine Dion), but investigators are also going to be looking into the large appearance fees paid to Hollywood \"celebs\" to show up at the club. But don't worry - the club is still open for business.Photo Credit

We want to offer a hearty congratulations to Andrew Sasson, who has just sold off a 50% stake of the Light Group to the Dubai-based Zabeel Investments, who seem to have fallen head over heels over the upcoming Harmon Hotel project. According to the press release, Zabeel's \"goal is to develop the hospitality industry in the UAE and across the region - an aim which encompasses all areas of this sector from food and beverage to hotels and restaurants. In addition, The Light Group can tap our UAE hospitality expertise, and evolve that to other developments around the world.\" We commend your selection. Say what you will about Sasson et al, but the group has been wildly successful as hospitality operator in Vegas. Selling a 50% stake to Zabeel is only going to raise their bar, infusing them with a huge chunk of capital to allow them to take their operation global. Exciting stuff.

We pity poor David Kaplan, the young up and comer who's Death and Co. has gone to battle with the fearsome fogies of Community Board 3. It seems his cocktail restaurant lounge type thing is going to be bullied by his neighbors right out of business. How bad have things gotten? So bad that Kaplan has to take umbrage with the author of a recent sympathy piece that labeled Death and Co. as a bar. The madness has got to stop. While we support a neighbor's right to relative quiet, New York as a city must make it possible to open and operate a business. With the pending economic issues, this will become even more evident, as potential entrepreneurs (David Kaplan) who are hoping to pour their heart and soul into opening a restaurant, lounge or bar will look at the neighborhood, the high rent, the fees, taxes and regulatory BS and run the other way. Add an onerous community board to the mix and opening an interesting place to have a cocktail is nearly impossible. Death and Co. is a bar! Their drinks are good, their food is passable. Give them a damn liquor license and let's wrap this shenanigan up. [Photo Credit]

Anyway, Stevie says \"I will tell you what happened then, what's happening now, and what will happen tomorrow. I will make sure your night is done right.\" Fascinating. He is off to a huge start, running some sort of interview with the folks behind the already ous't Mansion, saying \"This crew has enough energy to ensure success. In my humble opinion they are a force capable of leading clubdom to a new era.\" Well, according to a Little Birdy who was there this weekend, this new era is going to be defined by lameness. Our LB says, \"Was at Mansion over the weekend. The place is poorly designed, 75% empty, filled with ugly talent, and has fat girls in spandex hanging off the ceiling. Mark Baker himself came by our table to chat us up. Very creepy. I give this place 4 months.\" And that's that.Back to the point, we welcome Steve Lewis into our realm. May the best blog win.

rumor has it Stereo was shut because a totally secret reason. Satsky and Gefner had a 3rd partner Barry Mullinux???. And all the little people that used to work at stereo told me that barry was a Mastermind and managed to steal a boat load of cash. they say he stole over 5k a week in cash. satsky is a real putz to get fooled. he deserved it if he couldnt stop it.

Courtesy of our friends at HotelChatter, things are moving right along at Eric Goode and Sean MacPherson's newest hotel venture, the Riverview. Interior demolition has begun, and we have to believe they are making moves to try and clear the remaining tenants. We have also come to learn that the dynamic duo is going to turn the magnificent tower overlooking the water into a lounge. Very cool, if they decide to let anyone in or serve non-guests drinks. But we also wonder what their tenants at Socialista are feeling? More on this to come.

We love all of our readers and welcome any and all comments. But we don't appreciate when interested parties anonymously drop glowing praises of their own venues. What is this - yelp? So it is with great sadness that we call out Shoolbred's for breaking this rule. After running a short item on the new East Village bar/resty, a commenter says:I was there this past weekend for a friend's birthday and we had a great time. Shoolbreds has everything from comfortable leather chairs around a fire place (it's like drinking in your living room but you don't have to clean up the mess...and there's a fireplace!) to a hidden hangout nook in the back. It has an heir of sophistication but can also be a place you go to to do Jager shots with your friends without being surrounded by college kids (although, what are you doing Jager shots for if you're out of college?!) Crowd was mostly in their 20's & 30's and the bartenders treated us great. I would say it's pretty much the full package. I'll go back. Well, our living room has windows and no fireplace, so it isn't exactly the same. But a few hours later, another commenter follows with: This place has a great atmosphere - love the leather chairs by the fireplace and the stained glass. It's definitely the kind of place you want to go to if you want to chill, throw back a few drinks, and hang out with your friends. My favorite parts: you don't have to stand there for 20 minutes waiting for a drink because there is ample staff and they're very good about taking care of you, and the music is not so obnoxiously loud that you are hoarse for 3 days after going out and screaming all night to someone who is standing right next to you. You can't beat that. Well, we were there when it was pretty dead and did wait 10 minutes for a drink. And frankly, the drink wasn't that good. We suggest running your own shop, rather than interfering in ours.

Time for a Wednesday edition of Quick Hits, where we just give you some really quick stories that we don't feel like using our wit and brain cells to expand upon. How many Q's in Quick Hits? Quick Hits!Today, we feature one Little Birdy sharing 3 stories. How lovely of you LB. Here we go. . The old Quo, or Myst, is re-opening very soon as either \"Aces N Spades\" or \"Prime\". . Marquee just re-opened their remodeled Red Room last night weekend. . I just heard a rumor that Bungalow is moving to Wall St. Could be cool.Interesting stuff LB, but we beg to differ on bullet 3. As bad as 27th Street has become, we don't think Sacco is repackaging Bungalow 8 to head down to Wall Street. As Eater has reported, the space below her real estate venture is going to probably be a large restaurant. Eventually, opening clubs becomes rather boring, and the folks like Miss Sacco look to passively make money. Nightclubs ain't passive kiddies. Unless you are the money and you are using it as a tax write off. Which you know we are.

The exciting conclusion of our very special 2 part series, Ins't or Ous't. Well, what are waiting for? Nothing. So our first few Little Birdies really didn't have much fun at Mansion. But maybe the crowd was super exclusive and made you feel privileged to be inside? Or maybe not. According to our final Little Birdy, \"This is perhaps redundant, but the \"private party\" was no more than an invitation to anyone on the not so exclusive asmallworld. With over 300,000 members now that is hardly what constitutes a private party (although probably a more reliable way to entice us banker types, if only marginally more so than MySpace).\" We know that the space is huge, but having to sell your exclusive opening weekend, during Fashion Week no less, is simply bad news. If this were publicly listed, we would be dumping shares like crazy. But it's just a club, so expect the vulture promoters to step in and fill this place with _______ (fill in blank). That's why we can officially stamp Mansion: Ous't.

I went to the party and it wasn't bad. The space was huuuuge, so it was hard to settle into a spot. They hired burlesque dancers and had intermittent performances which gave it a feel similar to The Box. It was totally crowded by midnight, but the smallworld people were good looking, young and spending money - so for the opening of a club that huge, it seemed to make sense.

4th blog I've read re: Mansion. The evening of the 10th was a private event. Management made a decision to open to the public when the event was over. Why not? There is an opening and then there is that silly little thing called \"grand opening\". To my knowledge, Mansion has not held their grand opening. The night I was there was kicking. Stellar DJ. Really loved the arialists, gogo elevators with dancers, the gospel choir and opera singer gave a great eclectic feel to the place. I've been waiting for a place that is far more than a club and this is it. It is a full service venue and it is huge! I hope it is as geared toward live performance as its predecessor was.Mansion New York should be a vastly different club than Mansion Miami. At least I hope it will be. New York is not Miami and a different crowd requires a different club. Top shelf decor, professional staff, and top class planned events ....along with one of the best sound systems in the city ...This fabulous VENUE is definitely going to be \"Ins't\".I am sure that come summer, it will be mind blowing - or at least entertaining enough for everyone to tear themselves away from MySpace for a few hours.

It's the return of everyone's favorite feature Ins't or Ous't, where we tackle the state of New York City nightlife establishments and decide whether they are worth your time. It's about effing time. Place: MansionNeighborhood: ChelseaStatus: Ous'tIt's only been three days since this club opened, not even to the public mind you, and we are already declaring it dunzo. Why? First of all, it's open in a dying nightlife neighborhood. And second, we have still not heard one positive thing about it. So today, we bring you 2 reports that re-confirm that this place is over and ous't. According to Little Birdy #1, Two rooms. Smaller one in baroque styling, pool table?!!, carpeted- waiting to envelope the smell of spilt, sticky drinks in weeks to come. Glass enclosed walls of flame, one located in the passageway between the two rooms which makes for an overheated tunnel. Notice the flames unevenly tempering off ? That’s what happens when you use those gel cans. The upstairs library is weird- the books look out of place. Can you tell it’s too many unfocused ideas implemented into one place? The random acts were, well, random. The choir throws off the mood. You half expect a kanye-like perfomance, but then again, this isn’t the Natural History Museum, haha. There were sheet acrobats in Britney wigs and a girl dressed in lights and spewing sparks into the crowd. These random acts are nothing like the tricks at The Box. It seemed circa 1999. But hey, I enjoyed the top-shelf open bar! If this is as good as you can get for your opening talent line up, then we thinks there be a problem. Stay tuned for Part II.

Over the weekend, we received the following email request:I am an avid fan of your blog. We both share an affinity for the nightlife industry, and I often am aware of some of your stories before they are posted. Hence, my friends have speculated that I am, in fact, the Hipster. They became especially suspicious after the Tom Arnold Sundance posting because I was one of few people outside. However, as you know this obviously is a case of mistaken identity. At first it was funny but now it has become an issue for me as the word has spread, with people wary having the “Hipster” around.That was the both the short and long of it, and we still don't know who sent it to us. But we do know something - whoever did write it certainly is not DBTH. So please, people who are associated with the author, stop being wary of having them around. They are still down. Just not BTH.

Now, the exciting conclusion of our First Responder report from Mansion, the Opium Group's newest club built right here in our fair City.After getting the first update from our Little Birdy, we couldn't help but wonder why they were sellin bottle services when we had been hearing all week that the club wasn't open to the public this weekend? We posed the question to our LB, who quickly responded:I thought about that one too. Obviously, they played it up as a private event, saw some people w invites who got right in, but inside were some familiar faces who I knew that also got in via the line. I had 12 ppl w me and the bottle prices were in the ice buckets. . . it is not the intimate ultra lounge they say it is. The cocktail waitresses were overwhelmed covering, 5-6 tbls and they clearly packed in as many ppl as they could. The \"upstairs vip\" area was no more exclusive than the rest of the place. All in my group felt the sheer size of the place will dissuade people who attend places like Gold Bar, Pink, Cain etc. Truth be told, other than the ball-like chandeleirs and some fire flames burning behind glass (like a miami club I forget) it isn't much different than Crobar was.Well, that's not a good sign. First weekends and soft opens are never easy, but we assumed that these folks would be able to hit the ground running. Guess not.

Below, Part I of our First Responder report from Mansion.One of our more frequent Little Birdy's was on hand for Mansion's big opening weekend and reports:Was at mansion last night for their \" private \" party. Took a table with some friends and a slew of girls. They seemed to be allowing people in w/o invites but I could be wrong. Never saw spice girls, but they did have a gospel choir at 1230. Made no sense. Sat in upstairs VIP area, 8 ppl, 3 btl minimum. Place is too cavernous, lacks the vip area that Mansion Miami has and the crowd was not as exclusive. I guess you have to compromise to fill a space this large. Music was not great, place was empty by 3am. Lots of available tables.A 3 bottle minimum in this economic climate is bold. Maybe 3 bottles of Amstel Light? Heh.

Hats off to one of Gawker's many new editors Hamilton Nolan for understanding the PR game. Amazingly, Mr. Nolan discovered that Scores treats the Post reporters nicely, and in turn, Page Six gives out favorable coverage. Now of course, we already have told you that Lonnie Hanover, the man behind the Quid Pro Quo, recently alligned himself with Rick's Cabaret. Thus, we said that we expect Rick's to become the most discussed strip club in the press, especially Page Six. Amazingly, it only took 2 days for Lonnie's hire to put Rick's all over the news map. Maybe it will help that stock price tick even further upward Monday morning.

Now that didn't take long. Just one day after telling you Skin Man Lonnie Hanover had joined Rick's Cabaret, the Sixers spread the word to their $0.25 mafia. We set our way back machine to yesterday, when we said \"Lonnie will repeatedly pimp the club on Howard Stern's Sirius Sattelite Radio show and in Page Six, and play host to celebrities of all sorts.\" Amazing how that works. Word is that Lonnie has already planned his first Howard Stern Show bonanza party for the weekend, so if you are into that sorta thing, we suggest heading over to W. 33rd.

In the current edition of Spin Magazine, writer Jonathan Ames, gets to spend an evening with Lenny Kravitz at GoldBar. Ames, probably the only music writer who does not know who John Mayer is, is the ultimate fish out of water. He describes himself as \"a journalist with bad breath, bad teeth, bad hair, and bad debt\", but for one night, he gets to be Lenny's wing man. Hilarity ensues, including Ames blowing his chance to dance with Cameron Diaz, imagining a favorite author writing a murder scene in the lounge, and generally creeping his interview subject and every female out. Good stuff Ames. But the piece does give those not in the know a glimpse into the life of the true GoldBar elite. European models, celebs, bankers and oh those sweet truffle fries. Enjoy.

Was there last night for a fashion week party: This place is amazing. The upstairs VIP area is a library! Fantastic! The chandeliers are phenominal, and the DJ booth is creatively poised and looks sic. Also, we genuinely enjoyed the gospel choir's preformance. Definitely should check it out if you can. I love this place, and it is one of the best set-ups I have seen.

The place looks great and it isn't even completely renovated yet. They had to rush the opening because of the fashion week parties but it should be completely finished in a few more weeks.

Big news from the world of gentleman's clubs. Lonnie Hanover, the man who made Scores New York's go to gentleman's club, has recently been hired by Rick's Cabaret as a \"publicity consultant\". Translation? Lonnie will repeatedly pimp the club on Howard Stern's Sirius Sattelite Radio show and in Page Six, and play host to celebrities of all sorts. Rick's, which is one of the few publicly traded gentleman's club chains, has been quietly trying to establish itself in the crowded NYC market. Expect this hire to solidify them among the upper echelon. Maybe Mr. Bruni will review their restaurant, but we doubt it.

When it comes to getting into Rose Bar, one of our intrepid commenters was 100% correct: \"Some places are not meant for everyone. Welcome to the world people.\" Unfortunately, Nicky Hilton learned this the hard way. Page Six reports, \"it seems Ian Schrager's ban on Paris Hilton at his Gramercy Park Hotel also applies to her sister Nicky. Spies outside spotted her 'desperately trying to get in' to the hip hotel's Rose Bar . . ., 'Nicky was texting Andy Valmorbida to come out and get her,' said the spy. But we hear the billionaire art dealer was too busy canoodling with Lenny Kravitz's ex, Sandy Meyer, to lend the Hilton sister a hand.\" Needless to say, the Hilton's could probably use a large dose of reality. But so can Rose Bar. Don't get us wrong, we love the place. But either you are open to the public or you aren't, and if you aren't, just be honest about it. It's really not that big a deal. But to ban someone because of their sister, or allow someone to pass doorman #1 without then letting them past doorman #2, or telling respected restauranters that they \"should shave and dress better\" if they want to come again is ludicrous. Consider us (gasp!) on Nicky's side.Photo Credit

Nicky Hilton wasn't at Rose Bar on the night in question - so she couldn't have been turned away. And I saw her there last night - so it appears there's no ban. You get your news from The Post?

Everyone tries to do something special for the Super Bowl, but the folks at the Spotted Pig really do take things to the next level. Being that Super Bowl Sunday is one of the slowest days of the year, owners Ken Friedman and April Bloomfield use it as a chance to throw their hard working staff a little party. Last year, they rocked Del Posto. This year, we hear that they took over La Esquina for the whole night. The menu is above, and it looks pretty darn tasty. Music was supplied by a couple of local DJ's, Mark Ronson and Moby. You may have heard of them. Apparently Jay-Z and Mike D. had to cancel at the last minute and they called them out of the bullpen. And for those staffers who wanted to watch the game, there was a big screen set up in their after-party suite at the Bowery Hotel, the big ass one with the balcony. That's what we call a Super Sunday. Please add us to next year's guest list.

More coverage from Fashion Week, with a guest LB from the This Is The Sweetest Dream blog supplying the coverage, saying \"went to the chloe sevigny for opening ceremony party last night at webster hall. it was a complete scene outside. williamsburg was probably empty last night - it was wayy hipster overload. the line was down the block and the cops showed up to clear the street. the snl crew (andy sanberg and seth meyers) even had to wait to get in. once in, it was insanely packed and the new wave music was taking over - \"the slits\" finally came on after 12. the beautiful margherita missoni showed up at one point - so gorgeous.\" Great stuff LB.

Fashion Week. It's back. It really felt like it never left. Anyway, somehow we wound up at Butter last night for the oh so spectacular afterparty for Charlotte Ronson. Fabulous! Seriously though, we want to thank Richie and Scott, Blue and Cream, the Ronson girls (Sammy Sam Dee Jayed of course) for being such gracious hosts. Except for all the smoke, we actually had a great time. There isn't much else to comment on: most of the people were cleared out at midnight to make way for the Monday night Butter elite, and that was the perfect time for us to exit stage left. Next.

We'd like to extend a hearty welcome to Shoolbred's, the new restaurant and lounge in the former Jade Mountain Chow Mein space, at 197 Second Avenue in the Upper East Village. Well, it's just a lounge for now, as the kitchen is not quite ready to go yet. After being jammed on Friday night, DBTH returned on Saturday to enjoy a drink and survey the scene. The bar, backed by colorful stained glass, is tastefully decorated, with a working gas fireplace in the back and a few booths and leather chairs. Space is otherwise tight. There are several choice beers on tap, but we weren't made aware of any specialty cocktail list. Maybe that's coming though. Go in and say hello, then let us know what you think.

I was there this past weekend for a friend's birthday and we had a great time. Shoolbreds has everything from comfortable leather chairs around a fire place (it's like drinking in your living room but you don't have to clean up the mess...and there's a fireplace!) to a hidden hangout nook in the back. It has an heir of sophistication but can also be a place you go to to do Jager shots with your friends without being surrounded by college kids (although, what are you doing Jager shots for if you're out of college?!) Crowd was mostly in their 20's & 30's and the bartenders treated us great. I would say it's pretty much the full package. I'll go back.

This place has a great atmosphere - love the leather chairs by the fireplace and the stained glass. It's definitely the kind of place you want to go to if you want to chill, throw back a few drinks, and hang out with your friends. My favorite parts: you don't have to stand there for 20 minutes waiting for a drink because there is ample staff and they're very good about taking care of you, and the music is not so obnoxiously loud that you are hoarse for 3 days after going out and screaming all night to someone who is standing right next to you. You can't beat that.

re: 2/9 9:32pWhen I went, there was no bar food yet. So I asked the bartender what kind of food there would be...answer was chicken wings, burgers, etc. Yum! If only there were a bunch of flatscreens so I could watch the Red Sox play!Looks like the East Village just got a little smaller...

Nice bar. Lots of single malt scotches. Bartenders in short kilts. My girlfriend likes that they fresh squeeze their grapefruit juice. Poster number 1 you are an idiot. Judging things before they exist is generally not a good policy. The Scottish influence can be seen in the wide variety of single-malt scotches, and bartenders in kilts. They don't have every vintage of your favorite scotch? They've been open for a few weeks and maybe they didn't think they would be getting too many people ordering $30-50 glasses of scotch. I don't know what distinguishes Murray Hill bar food from East Village bar food. Bar food is bar food. It seems like you're being really negative on the bar for being too corporate or something, while simultaneously complaining that they don't have some expensive scotch that you like. I don't know what you expect the East Village to be, but considering these guys turned an empty storefront into a nice bar, I think they are a welcome addition. Get over yourself.

Our friends at Grub Street have the press release details, saying: It will have the feel of forties Hollywood, with personal granite dance platforms at each Pucci-fabric sofa, a 20-foot enclosed fireplace, and three separate lounge areas. The interior isn’t yet photo-ready (we’re the first to run this rendering), but we’re dying to see the “Cougar Room,” a chicks-only den with hairdressers, makeup artists, sex toys, and girlie drinks by mixologist Gregory Selder.How over the top! How gimmicky! How Clubtacular! It looks like the even included those tables they require for success. We look forward to opening night.

Some people love to hate on the state of nightlife in New York City. Not us of course, but some people. But the City is still very fun, and it is possible to have a great time going out. On that note, a Little Birdy filed this report after what seems to be a lonnnnnnng night out, saying: u know gold bar? place is pretty serious stuff. degenerates of nyc in full swing at gold bar. 19 yr old brazilians having makeshift photoshoots as the party floods into the dj booth to play with the new mac computers. bottles of goose everywhere. i have 2 brain cells right now. give me some verbs. Was that English? Our Little Birdy's goose is done and done dirty. But you all get the drift. It seems that they had a killer time, and so can all of you. Keep sharing those stories everybody. We love em.

Yikes... seems as if our little birdy is waaay behind the times... hasn't Gold Bar been open for like months now? The concept seems so lame (Gold, really expensive drinks, Eurotrash) that I haven't even bothered to go there. If I want to shell out top dollar, I'll go to Milk & Honey and get a well-crafted drink, thanks.

@ Astralgirl - If you had been there, you'd know that they do take their mixology fairly seriously - perhaps not to M&H levels, but still much higher than most. That said, they are 2 completely different places, and are not competing for the same niche. I actually like both, it depends on what kind of mood I'm in.The B of the G is still one of my favorite places - super friendly and accomodating owners and staff, a great crowd (most of the time - it can get a little banker-y sometimes), and most importantly, close to home. Of my current circuit of Gramercy, Box and Beatrice - GB is still holding it's own. I was there last night and the energy and crowd was off the hook amazing!

I actually count a smattering of finance types among my friends, and there are some who are pretty cool and creative. HOWEVER, I never like to see too many anywhere, as it means they're crowding out the creatives - and more creatives just means a more interesting mix - in attitudes, approaches, dress and looks. I'm one of those rare birds who generally prefers a very mixed crowd when I go out - in age/race/orientation/class/uptown/downtown, etc. Homogeneousness is boring.

For those who like dress fancy, a retail update for you. Taavo Somer and his band of bespoked fellas from Freemans Sporting Club may be opening up a West Coast joint. A little birdy fills us in, saying \"they are looking at spaces to open a FSC in Los Angeles. It would have a different vibe than the LES branch, less old world feel and more of an LA, art deco type feel. Apparently this branch took a ton of time and money to create the feel they achieved.\" Very cool LB. So get ready all you LA kids. Classic rugged men's wear and accessories are coming your way.

Let's give it up for NBC's Tiki Barber. After spending 15 years playing high level football, he retires and joins NBC to showcase his on-air \"talent\". Then his old team makes it to the Super Bowl without him. Some people would be upset. Not Tiki? This man lends his name to a pre-Bowl party sponsored by Tenjune. Good for you Tiki. Good for you.

According to our buddies at Page Six, Stereo is no more. We can't say we are too sad, our experiences there have been mixed, and in terms of business, the place wasn't all that successful. Crowded yes, but just not that profitable. According to the Sixers, \"Club trademark owner Michael Satsky and partner Brian Gefter split from other club part ners and are close to leasing a downtown space for a new venue this year.\" Probably a good move on their part. These guys are ready to step out on their own and make a go of it. But the real question is: where is there to go? As we have been saying for a while, the place to be is NoChiTo, the little no man's land of space below Nolita and west of Chinatown. You may have heard about some other major players setting up there, and we expect Iron Mike and BG to head down there as well.

Home Sweet Home. The name says it all. Or does it? Descend down an unmarked staircase on Chrystie Street, just a stone's throw from the Cube, and speak to the dude collecting cash outside the door. The party tonight is $5, and everyone is paying. We're not special. Open the door and survey the scene: low ceiling, taxidermy scattered this way and that, hipster bartenders, and Suicide looking Girls writhing this way and that. OK. The room is wide, then very narrow, then wide in the back. Dumb bell steez. While the music was outstanding and the bartenders attentive, the night just never got going. With just a few couches scattered every which way, it was difficult to find a home base, and in a small room, that's a problem. Its ok, though. These things happen. We stayed for a bit more but realized it wasn't the night, and headed for the door. When we left in the wee hours of the morning, there was a line 15 deep waiting to get in, all of em just looking for a home.

The Bridge and Tunnel sect sure do love the Manhattan nightlife. Every Thursday, Friday and Saturday, they invade the island looking for a good time. On the one hand, it's good for our local economy. On the other hand, well . . . You know the drill. Some folks are trying to upset that balance. It seems that Mark, Eugene and the whole EM Group are looking to invade New Jersey! Hoboken to be exact. The Houston's loving crew will be creating a new nightlife venue at the soon to be completed W Hoboken. We don't know many details as of yet, but you can imagine they would include some great outdoor space and of course, those killer Manhattan views that the Bo is famous for. Just another demonstration of why it's so important to know your customer base and cater to their need. If your NYC venues are at capacity every weekend, why not open a second venue closer to home. Look for this one to open this winter a bit after the rest of the hotel.

So you want to go to the Super Bowl but don't have tickets. Not a problem. Your old pals at DBTH have your solution. We asked our good friends at In the Know Travel to put together the ultimate Super Bowl Package, and we have to say they came through with flying colors. Let's break it down on a day by day basis and see how it looks.Thursday January 31st . Check into your own private 5500 square foot Villa at the five star Sanctuary Camelback Mountain Resort & Spa, featuring 4 four bedrooms, four baths, gourmet kitchen, billiards lounge, stereo system, and a plush living area open onto a deck to enjoy the glorious sunsets and mountain views. Don't forget the hot tub either. . Hit the 944 Mag Village/50 Cent/Paris Hilton extravaganza at the Scottsdale Waterfront at Stetson Canal - VIP style of course.Friday February 1. Leather and Laces Ball with Carmen Electra, Katherine Bell, and Roselyn Sanchez. Don't forget about the entertainment by Sugar Ray featuring Mark McGrath, Various DJs, the Girls from Deal or No Deal and Special Performances by Cirque du Soleil. Not too fing shabby. Saturday February 2. It's not all parties and glam. May as well fit in 18 holes while you are in the desert, and the best way to do that is at the NFL Charities Celebrity Golf Classic at the Wigwam Golf Resort and Spa. Sunday February 3. Sunday. Game Day. You may as well come correct because you don't know when you will have this chance again. What do we have on tap? The ultimate package for any football fan. Start off with three hours of hospitality with seasonal & regional food stations, full open bar, live entertainment, multi-screen pre-game broadcast, dedicated security entrance into stadium perimeter and more. As a bonus, the always rockin Earth Wind and Fire will perform for the assembled VIPs. Aww yeah.. Last but not least - game time. How about a fully catered Luxury Suite for you and 7 of your closest friends on the 40 yard line. Enjoy the game in the ultimate setting while the rest of the common folk is smushed together in their non-luxury box seatings.Now you are talking about WOW! BOOM! If you have to worry about the price, well maybe this isn't the package for you. But we can guarantee you the folks at In the Know can suit something to fit your needs. The game is less than a week away, so we suggest giving them a shout. RIGHT NOW!

Got a complaint, question or piece of news you want to share? You know where to send em.To Whom It May Concern,You recently wrote an article on Upstairs in which was brought to my attention. My name is Matt Levine, and I own the clothing line, Steelo'.Just FYI, the event Tuesday night at Upstairs was a private early event, from 9:00 - 1:00 (Upstairs is not open on Tuesdays), that is the reason why everyone left, because I had rented the venue out during those time slots for my Fall 08 Preview Party, as an After-Project Show party as well. (and all attendees had to be at the Project Show the following morning at 9:00am). We knew there had to be a good reason for it. Thanks for keeping us posted.

On a chilly night in early January, DBTH trekked to the quiet corner of 3rd and Berry in Williamsburg to hoist a few heavy mugs of hearty Bavarian brew at the borough's newest biergarten, Radegast. Surprisingly, the place was rather empty when we arrived and seemed to stay that way throughout the night. No matter. We were there to drink and be merry and on those accounts, all was successful. The main room hods the bar and numerous tables for ordering off the proper menu, which is rather small and a bit fancy for our beer garden liking. The second room, which the staff calls outside, is where the main action is. Long picnic tables line the narrow space, and in the back lies the mighty grill, with a grill meister serving up traditional brats and kielbasa. Now we're talking Germany (and other nearby countries too). The important thing to remember is you aren't here to mess around. Sit down, order a liter of beer, and get to drinking. That's what it's all about. The 'outside' is sure to pick up as the temperature rises and the retractable roof comes into play. We celebrate the opening of a new traditional beer hall in the City, and will definitely be making a return appearance.

We were just starting to catch our breath from Sundance when the next batch of flyers started to arrive in the old birdy box. The Super Bowl is next weekend and like all other major events, it has grown to something much greater than just a football game. So what's up first? The Myspace Friday Night Lights party. Yes! They grouped together some injured or semi-retired NFLers, a star of the NBC mini-hit, and the oh so wonderful Kendra Wilkinson to create the greatest party environment of all time! Oh, and don't forget about oh-so androgynous Pete Wentz on the decks. This is an all star lineup that will have all the people going crazy, no doubt. And for just $3500, you and five friends can take it all in - VIP style. Empty those savings accounts now.

Behold, some of the first available images from, Upstairs, the oh so secretive lounge above Cafe Bari in Soho. It looks amazing doesn't it? It does. But what we want to know is, why does it close so early? Last night, Cisco Adler and his band played there, but when they mercifully stopped playing, the lights came on at 1:00 AM and everyone was forced out. Very strange for a late night spot. Very strange. Then again, it seems weird things have a way of happening there.

A few weeks back, a reader fired off an angry salvo regarding some rude treatment in the lobby bar at the Bowery Hotel. You can read all about it here. It touched off a rather spirited debate in the comments, with many readers sharing experiences of being turned away or simply not served, even while hoping for an afternoon cup of tea. Other comments lamented the state of New York City, saying \"WE HAVE BECOME A CITY AND A WORLD OF PARIS HILTONS. GOD HELP US.\" We posed the question to the hotel itself but received no response. We may have to gear up for a stealth run inside the quiet lobby ourselves to settle this once and for all. God help us indeed. Got a complaint or a question? Please do let us know.

More postings from Park City, and things are starting to get weird. How weird? Weird enough that lead singers with a history of strange behavior totally blow off a scheduled gig. Let us explain. Velvet Revolver played Sunday night at Tao, though not everyone made it to the stage. Scott Weiland was nowhere in sight and an unidentified gentlemen joined Slash and the boys to sing. The regular band members did not seem pleased with the situation. After an encore of Mr. Brownstone, the singer thanked the crowd for coming to see \"Velvet Revolver\". Slash reacted by saying \"This isn't Velvet Revolver\" and quickly walked off stage. So where is Mr. Weiland? Rumors abound - back in rehab, missed his flight, got arrested the night before in Park City - but no one could tell us for sure. We have been checking the local park benches and bus shelters to no avail.

You know how NYC clubs such as Cain and Pink Elephant have been trying to find locations in London? Of course you do. Unfortunately things may have hit a snag. Due to the weak value of the dollar and London's notoriously expensive key costs, it may not be financially feasible to open in the current mecca of international nightlife. According to one Little Birdy, \"these clubs and operators have very strong, proven concepts that has a lot of investors interested. The numbers just aren't working right now.\" That sucks for London and the players, but could potentially be a boon for NYC, as experienced operators and their overseas investors may possibly look for opportunities in the domestic real estate market. Obviously, we'll keep you posted.

We're still hanging tough at the dance, coming through with a follow up from the gifting houses that have become even more important the movies. What was hot today? Would you believe Stereo? You should. Celeb highlights included Paris, Jessica Alba, Adrian Grenier, Alex von Furstenberg, and others. Highlight of the day is Mary-Kate Olsen. Iron Mike Satsky cleared out the entire place so mk could grab swag unhindered. No one was allowed in while she was inside, including tom Arnold, who was told he could not come in and turned away. And that's why we love us some MK.

We made a super last minute decision to head out to Park City, Utah. The town is super buzzed that we made it, and we are going to be filing semi-regular reports from the scene. A few nights back, we happened to make it to a dinner with Chef James Boyce from Montage LA, who served up a delectable 4 course meal to 100 of Park City's finest. Happy birthday was sung by all to celebrity event planner Jessica Rosenblum, who will be launching Pepsi's new Tava beverage later this week along with other events. Post dinner, we trekked over to Harry O's which will become Tao for the next 4 days. None other than Akon, who we had really never heard of, stepped up to the mic and rocked the house. The ladies swooned as Akon stripped to his skivvies towards the end of the performance. Sexy mofo. Other attendees included Ronnie Madra, Simon Rex, and Lloyd form Entourage in the house among others. The gifting suites launched today with Marquee, Stereo, Green House, Hyde, and 5W all representing. Free stuff for important people. Super.

What kind of music venue books a band for a Saturday night show and then attempts to ruin everyone's evening? Apparently Crash Mansion on the Bowery. A recent visitor writes, \"my friends band was playing and they turned the music from the club upstairs on in the middle of the set and then started kicking everyone out of the bar the second they were done playing. was such bullshit ... guess they had to hurry so all the half dressed hookers from boulevard could occupy the space.\" That's not right on so many levels. May we suggest taking some management lessons from the BP folks at Webster Hall. Those kids can pack in 1000 people for a show and still turn the place around for their infamous Ladies Night. Let's get it together Crashy. Team.

More from the ongoing saga that is the Tenjune vs Stereo battle, with a Little Birdy saying \"FYI....mark birnbaum had a restraining order against statsky. it was comical to see the riff in ny nightlife between the Raleigh (noah jason and statsky) and the Shore Club (tenjune). When will these two year olds grow up and run a company. I guess this is why stereo is no more.\" First, don't say FYI. Second, thanks for the tip. We have heard there was a major battle for Miami real estate for the annual Xmas/NYE pilgramage south. But it seems it all worked itself out. Or did it? This is so dramatic.

A wild story just came across the wire. Let's go straight to the Little Birdy, who says:a very interesting incident occurred right before New Years, and it has failed to receive the necessary exposure. Recently at Houston's restaurant, the entire EM group was eating dinner. Randomly, Stereo owner Mike Satsky entered the restaurant with one of his associates, and upon sighting Mark Birnbaum walked directly up to him and hit him \"open-handed\" out of his chair. He then proceeded to put him in a head lock. Eugene and the rest of the TJ managers looked on with shock from there seats while this occurred. After some heated words, Satsky voluntarily left the restaurant. There are reports that Birnbaum is now trying to press charges.The fight stems from the huge beef between Noah/Satsky and Birnbaum, which I'm sure your well aware of- but I could offer some background if your not. The catalyst of this climatic brawl was TJ stealing away DJ Suss One from Stereo, coupled with Birnbaum sending Satsky texts stating \"how good the music is now.\" Both clubowners are represented by the same publicists (Shadow PR), which is why this entertaining story was killed in the papers.An open fisted slap to the ground. Fierce. We checked in with a source who confirms the entire incident, saying \"it def happened. i thought eugene was slapped also.\" A double slap? Crazy! First question - why are all these guys eating at Houston's? Nasty. Second - did anyone present manage to get a video of this. We predict high comedy. Maybe we can set up a rematch at a neutral location. Does Touch work for everyone? They probably could use the business.

the fight originated from a beef between Eugene/mark and noah t. word on the street was that E/M were trying to snag employees from Strategic group. then noah scooped a few venues in miami during new years from the tenjune people. satsky is such a noah sweatjob that even though he has his own club he is on noahs side

Satsky aggresively grabbed Mark's scalp and vigirously throat fucked Mark until he gagged and choked and farted light brown skids in the tighty whities his mom just purchased for Hanakuh!! That's the God's honest truth! So help me God!

All of this is BS, Eugene Remm and Mark Birnbaum r the best in the industry and more professional than the countless other idiots out there... And if we r talking about clubs, I've been to stereo once and never returned. the place is a joke. Tenjune on the other hand continues to run the city.

night owl is CLEARLY a member of 10j team, its embarassing that they need to post things like that to make think that they are on that level. i could care less about stereo or 10j, but satsky has been in his position for years and is not a fake and seems like 10j guys are jealous and want to be real, but they manufacture rather than posses the real goods. night owl is a great pr stunt, but people are not dumb.

After the well-documented and unfortunate events that took place at Stereo last weekend, the entire crew has packed up and moved the operation out to Park City to the Stereo/In Touch/Kenneth Cole house. A reader who got the invite points out everyone's favorite part of Sundance - the gifting! According to the email, the available gifting includes \"I-phones, I-Pods, Playstations, Espresso Makers, 5 star vacations, and much much more.\" Damn! Sign us up. However, our reader also cautions, \"for stereo's sake, i hope the Mormans out in Utah haven't gotten wind of their reputation.\" Here, here.

Have you been hearing about this Beatrice Inn place, but somehow never been able to break through the iron velvet ropes? Today may be your lucky day. A Sherlock Holmes esque Little Birdy passed along this little nugget of Joy - The Beatrice Inn iMix, saying \"so im not sure where this came from, but the there is a beatrice inn playlist on itunes that you can buy. it's an imix under the name beatrice w12 & 4th. . . honestly, it looks like its reached a saturation point if you can create the \"experience\" in your own home thanks to itunes. i guess all you need to do is download the album, lower your ceiling, and have everyone smoke in your face!\" Exactly. It does seem to encompass the entire 2:30 - 4:00 AM playlist, including the sure to please Rich Girl. We hear that's MK's fave.

Tava, the new zero calorie beverage, is having a bash at Tao's Park City outpost, with a Little Birdy saying \"huge production budget launch of new Pepsi product.\" The budget is so huge that Pepsi managed to snag performances by One Republic and Keri Hilson.

There are some really tough doors in this city. Two of the toughest just happen to be two of our favorites. In this very special edition of Quick Hits, our faithful readers ask for advice on breaking through the iron velvet rope. 1. Went to rosebar last mth & they've told me that i need a reservation! I've never made a reservation before (well, they had d&g party that evening and that had something to do with it?) well, anyways.. one of my gal wanted to go & she emailed but never got a response.. so.. what's the secret?2. Any tips on scoring a reservation at rose bar? They never seem to respond to emails.3. The only thing that I am irked about is that I have not been able to get access into Beatrice Inn- maybe it's because I've shown up at 2:30 or 3 in the morning the two times I went-but both times me and my two (attractive) girl friends were turned away! What is the secret to that place?! We hate to see our readers not being able to enjoy themselves. However, not gaining entry to Rose Bar means you are saving some serious scratch. Drinks were going for $21 a pop last Friday. Ho-lee. But as always, it tends to be who you know. Go early on what may be an off night and try to sweet talk the doormen, be nice, and ask if you can stop in for a drink sometime. If that doesn't work, you can always try the direct approach, but we predict a rough time. Do you have any advice? Comments are open. Photo Credit

Rose Bar email list system has a screener... if your name is not in the database they've set up, you're effed from the jump.And going to the the Beatrice at 2:30/3, and you're not a friend of the house? Suicide. Go earlier, and be real quiet walking up and polite at the door. They hate anyone who gets them the wrath of the neighbors (i.e. loud drunken girls outside begging for entrance).

A bit of news from the desert. We had previously heard rumors of another mega project from Noah and Jason at the new Palazzo in Las Vegas. Originally, it seemed that they would try to bringing the Stanton Social concept out west with Marc Packer and Rich Wolf and then attach a mega-club and pool, just like their ridiculously successful Tao operation. Apparently, these plans have been scrapped for something much grander and dare we say, international. We'll let our Little Birdy tell you the rest:A friend in Monaco is telling me that Samy Sass, from Sass Cafe in Monaco famed is partnering with Noah and Jason to do a Sass Cafe concept in Vegas that is restaurant, lounge, club, pool, etc. This would be in line with comments they have made in the Vegas press about opening a 'vibe dining' concept. Further, the word out of London is that the guys from Mo*vida (the hottest club in London that ripped off the name from NY) are doing something in Vegas, but nobody knows where. Turns out Samy is partners with them in Mo*vida. So, my conclusion is Noah and Jason are up to something big with some major operators from Monaco and Vegas. Not just big, but so big that there is a complete gag order on the whole thing and no info available anywhere.Well, except for right here of course. So much for your gag order fellas. This partnership represents globalization at its finest, and follows Strategic Group's process of taking on partners to minimize risk and keep their capital contribution to a minimum. Smart move, especially with the tightening of the credit markets and weak dollar, to bring in some global players who have shied away from Vegas in the past. Will it work? Only time will tell.

After receiving the flyer shown above, one reader has had enough, saying, \"Do these things actually entice people to go to these places? She is not even cute. I love that I am 'cordially invited to attend'. Oh, and the computer rendering of the place really makes me want to go even more. Imagine getting one of these and thinking, you know what, I'm going to go to tonight, its just too hot to miss.\" We couldn't have said it any better ourselves. In fact, we have nothing to add.

The hits just keep on coming. A Little Birdy just hit us on the wire with some big news, saying \"David Cabo and Shawn Kolodny are in London as we speak looking at spaces for the Pink Elephant.\" That's real time information folks. With Bungalow 8 already open and Cain looking to close their deal, it makes sense that the Pink Elephant crew would soon follow. Also, we have seen a clear demarcation in the New York Club world between the global players and the regional ones, with players such as Noah and Jason and the Stereo crew (who have recently been seen in Vegas looking at deals), keeping their eyes on Las Vegas megaclubs and the tourists who flock to them, while the Cain and Elephant team cater to the global scene, of which London is the capital. And Ms. Sacco? With projects in Vegas, London and her mega deal with Morgans, she is obviously the big bird of the nest.

Yep, dead on... I used to work for a hotelier/restauranteur here in NYC, and he was soooo chuffed that he was only able to break out into one (albeit major) city. The nightlife/restaurant/lounge game is now all about \"how do I get my brand to the absolute next level... in another global city?!?!\"That said, I keep hearing about a certain someone trying to make big, big moves in the Latin American and Russian markets by opening up branches of his chic and haute properties.....

We get so many reports from around the world, we had to figure out a way to get it to our faithful readers. May we introduce our Postcard From ... series, in which we keep you informed of the most recent happenings, openings, and events in the global scene. Today, a Postcard from Dallas. If you know anything about anything, then you know that Dallas is currently enjoying a real renaissance. Translation? It's hot. How hot? About 61 degrees. Scorching. An operator happened to dropped us a line from the Big D, and we thought it was beyond worthwhile. Operator? \"I read the 2007 wrap up and couldn't help but notice you were hoping for some more great margarita places. Well, I just happen to be opening one next week here in Dallas. It's called La Condesa and is in Victory Park, almost adjacent to the American Airlines Arena. This thing is authentic all the way, tacqueria, full tequila service and margarita bar, even an authentic Caesar salad (created in Mexico). Think it's right up your alley.\" Looking at the menu, this does seem to be right up our alley. And the Caesar was invented in Tijuana in 1924 by Caesar Cardini. How about that? Amazingly enough, they didn't even have to open in a basement. Can you believe it? Good luck La Condesa. Send us some tacos.

Bar Boulud - Daniel Boulud's new Upper West Side wine bar - sure is generating a ton of attention. Understandable of course. But if you are interested in Chef Boulud's most important project, may we please direct your attention to Maison Boulud a Peking. We may? Thank you. Set to open this spring at Beijing's (Legation Quarter), Maison Boulud will inevitably become the finest French restaurant to open in Asia's hottest city. The design is by Gilles et Boissier, the French firm responsible for Budakkan NYC and the Gramercy Park Hotel. We asked our Little Beijing Birdy for some additional color, and of course they obliged, saying \"perhaps most interesting - this restaurant will be located in the former American embassy with views of the Mao mausoleum and Tiananmen Square. And get this - the dining room is in the space where Henry Kissinger secretly met Zhou Enlai to lay the framework for Nixon's historic meeting with Mao.\" Historic indeed LBB. You are so learned. Maison Boulud will feature a main dining room and separate bar and lounge. So enjoy your wine bar New Yorkers - we're booking our tickets for Beijing.

Trouble at the Bowery

A reader fired off an angry salvo last night from outside the Bowery Hotel after apparently not being allowed to enjoy a drink in their lobby bar. Our reader writes, \"Fuck the Bowery Hotel. From mellow and cool to pretentious and lame. Fuck that place. Telling me I can't sit down and its their policy to only let guests sit. Place was empty and I kindly offered to get up if guests came and they needed to seat them. They were rude for the sake of being rude.\" Wow. Tell us how you really feel reader. We had heard the same line a few times, but they were always accommodating, especially if the lobby was empty enough. But in 2008, the Bowery don't play. That's two of their three bars which are now off limits most of the time. We'll always have Gemma though.

I cannot concur more.They are inept and rude at the Bowery and just plain stupid at Gemma.When I tried to sit outside this summer for drinks they pulled the same crap with me and it was only a quarter full.And as for a new Gemma story - I knew two people who went to dinner there before the opening of the New Museum on Bowery. The restaurant was almost empty and the hostess tried to seat them in the back room in between two of the few tables that were actually taken. Needless to say they asked to be moved and the hostess said \"I am sorry we have reservations\". To this my friends laughed, left and went to Sala across to street for a better meal with out the ridiculous attitude.I look forward to Bowery advertising to the B&T crowd.

fuck that place i had the same experience in the lobby last week. i've been going there since it opened and its transformed from a friendly cool hang out to a lame out of towner hang out filled with staff including and especially managers that are inept, rude and flat out obnoxious. it will be B&T just like bowery bar and the park. these guys just don't know how to keep places cool. two thumbs down and i call for a hipster boycott of the bowery hotel. who's with me?

Hmm. I had a long conversation with the PR for The Bowery back in November for an NYC Guide I was filing for a Brit style mag. I quizzed him long & hard about the guests only stories I kept hearing about the lobby bar and he assured me they were completely untrue, that anyone could drink there. Maybe he spoke with forked tongue. Oh silly me he's a PR... of course he did! LLG xx
Yeah, but whatever
2008-01-08 22:50:00
...I agree. Rude, inept. But get over it. You are talking about an area of NYC (i.e., the E. Vil.) that has plenty of watering holes. Like the guy who left and went to Sala, just don't give them money!

I tried going for a drink at the Bowery recently & was also turned away, but in an affable manner.I used to work in a hotel & fully understand that Hotel Lobby bars should be exclusive to guests that travel long distances & pay exorbitant rates to have a civilized setting to relax.Hotel Lobby bars are quaint for the very reason that they are prioritized for the guests.it's a bit refreshing to see that yokels don't always get to make cool exclusive places become pedestrian hang outs even if i'm on the rejected end.Kiddies remember where you live & that there are other public places to have expensive cocktails.

I am a frequent guest of the Bowery and I pay a great deal of money to stay there while on business in New York. Their policy to maintain a civilized lobby for paying guests of the hotel is understandable and not unlike other hotels in New York City. I find the staff to be kind, hospitable and lovely. It seems these people are singling out The Bowery because they feel entitled to have a hip bar to hang out at and are angry when turned away. Its easy to understand that the management doesnt want the place to become overrun with scenesters - thats not what its about. If these people like posting about being turned away at Bowery, they'll love posting about being turned away at Waverly Inn.

money talks and bullshit walks.this is the oldest story in the world, hey even my post office has a velvet rope (not kidding at all it does), if you don't want to be kicked out there are 2 or 3 things you can do.1 grease the place. everyone has a price and if you feel too high and mighty to call it a bribe then call it something else, be creative but keep it in cash.2 get to know who runs the place and I am not talking about the promoter who does a saturday night party. get to know S&E and you won't ever have a problem at the bowery or any other project they are part of.3 be a name. a real name that means something to someone who cares about who is in the place.if I have to explain this one your problems don't end here.good luck and don't forget your bankroll next time you go out.hipster=broke artist=coolmodel=assetsuit=$$$$which one is not like the other one?

oompaloompa It's a lobby bar - who are we supposed to grease - the couch? It was always a place to get a quiet drink (too quiet) and now its just an empty lobby not to drink.

2008-01-11 12:28:00
hey oompaloompa its a frikkin lobby bar with no door person. everyone is complaining bc its supposed to be a chill place. if there is any greasing or names there then its the opposite of what we have been going to the last several months. you've missed the entire point of these comments. go back and reread what the initial post said.

I tried to have a simple mid day cup of tea in their empty lobby, and was ignored. We sat there for about a half hour or so wondering if someone would come and take an order. They had no way of knowing if we were about to check in, or had planned to meet hotel guests. Still, it was like we were invisible. The only other people there were a French family, who eventually got their bill, and an offer to call them a cab. We were still invisible. Eventually, after sitting for a good half hour, taking business calls, and just finding the whole experience rather curious, I decided to go and ask someone if there was anyone to take our order. At the alcove bar, there was a bartender doing some cleaning who informed me a concierge was attending to guests. We got the feeling they weren't handling cash, and were strictly charging to rooms, and gave up. I have never been turned away from a hotel lobby bar, or even heard of such a thing. Why would anyone turn down a chance to make a buck? It's a hotel, not a private club. Worse, they changed their policy at random. What idiots.

Went right after they opened was served on the patio area the WORST sazerac ever. when they opened they were pushing the fact that they made quality cocktails. At no time should my drink have looked like a fruit salad with rye. I pulled a cherry orange lemon and lime out of the drink. To the waitress's credit she did comp my next drink after realizing she fucked up.

I understand the frustrations of those who have been turned away from the Bowery Hotel but on the other hand, I understand the motivation of the hotel. They are thinking about their brand and the kind of service they want to offer to there guests who I am sure contribute over 70% of their revenue. At the end of the day, it's their prerogative

We get so many reports from around the world, we had to figure out a way to get it to our faithful readers. May we introduce our Postcard From ... series, in which we keep you informed of the most recent happenings, openings, and events in the global scene. First up, a Postcard From Los Angeles.Nightlife sure is fickle in LA. Bars and clubs come and go so regulary, it's tough to know what's in and when. Just like the actors who dominate the scene, one day your hot and one day you're not. A Little Birdy sent us a Postcard from the Coast with news from a nightspot that is mos definitely hot, at least for now. Our LB says, Went to Villa last night, it is a new spot in LA owned by Vinny Laresca (actor from Weeds, Juice, 24 etc...) and Chuck Pacheco (Alpha Dog) also rumored part owner Leo, who was there with Wahlberg, Kevin Connelly and a bunch of others were all there last night. It's a two story lounge, very small and comfortable. Real tough door, I feel like they want to keep it to regulars and celebs.Nicely designed by Icrave, good staff, friendly and well trained. Overall its a cool spot except for the music that night. The dj was someone who should not be DJing but thats my person taste in music.You can't win em all Little Birdy. At least you busted past the clipboard mafia. But it was never really in doubt for you. Keep those Postcards coming.

We know you missed it, so we brought it back. It's mofo Quick Hits, where we give you a lot of information at an above average pace. If you are ever in the sharing mood, please let us know. QUICK HITS!1. In a shocking twist of events, the newspaper has come down from the Good Dog windows. A peek inside revealed what appears to be an espresso machine, so the likelihood of a small cafe seems high. Thankfully, the giant paper maché Good Dog mascot remains. 2. A Little Birdy tells us that Bagatelle, the currently in development French restaurant that will be adjacent to Kiss and Fly in the MePa, has unfortunately been delayed. Our LB says, \"Bagatelle plans to open the week of the 14th. Lets see if they plan to open with sawdust still in the air as they did with Kiss & Fly.\" Let's see indeed.3. Speaking of French restaurants, we happened upon, Antibes, a new one that has recently opened at 127 1st Avenue. In a shock for the neighborhood, they easily secured a beer and wine license before opening. May we propose checking them out - we love to support the little guy.

Newyorkology (via Eater) comes through with the recently launched website for Robert De Niro and friends Greenwich Hotel. Ressies are being accepted for the first 3 weeks of April, when the hotel will then become the de facto home of out of town stars during the Tribeca Film Festival. Glamorous. Metro Travel Guide supplies the rest of the gory details about the rooms and property, including the Shibui Spa that \"features a lantern-lit swimming pool and a lounge area\". Best news - Ago will be delvireing room service to guests 24/7. Osso bucco all night. That's worth the $725 per night intro rate, right? Right.

Just yesterday, one of our beloved commenters asked, \"Ok, a bit obsessed with 1OAK, are we? Are you getting paid out of their publicity budget, ha?\" Unfortunately, we get nothing for our posts. We have even heard rumors that we are officially banned from 1OAK, but that is neither here nor there. But, the people are interested in more information, so we must provide. A Little Birdy heard that Roy Nachum, the controversial designer of 1OAK, was \"posting some pictures from 1oak on his website\". It's true. Some very classy shots are available, some of which we posted here. Camera phones really don't give it justice so we are running it again. We really do love this woman kissing bull picture. It's our new background and is so thought provoking.

Besides talent, banging DJ's, and overpriced drinks, what can you really expect when you finally get inside 1OAK? How about some creepy art featuring giant animals nestling up to half naked people. Umm, right. A Little Birdy who tells us they have already been to the not yet open club \"a dozen times\" snapped a few camera phone images for us, reporting, \"Attached are pics of the artwork from the Israeli designer. Bestiality is one way people describe his style, while others find him to be a copy-artist. Ever see that huge Elvis carbon copy in the back of Southern Hospitality? That was painted by none other that Mr. Israeli as well.\" While a bit creepy, at least they didn't cherry pick the taxidermy vibe. And we bet you always wanted to kiss a bull while his buddy got to watch. It's OK, that can be our secret.

The folks behind Cain had quite a busy 2007. They opened Gold Bar, signed a new lease for their flagship club on 17th Street, and brought their brand of Cain fun to the Bahamas. Now what to do? They aren't following the current trend of supersizing themselves out in Vegas. What they are going to do is open up in London. That's right, London. Our first Little Birdy of the year reports, \"Cain is opening in London. Confirmed.\" My, my LB. You certainly are sure of yourself. And why wouldn't you be; you have been right so many times before. We will certainly keep you posted as this story develops.

Well, this is it. Our final post for 2007. We are taking a well deserved break from the scene, the computer, and all that malarkey. Don't we deserve it? Of course we do. We think we brought the thunder and the lightning to you all year long. If you don't, well, then maybe we need to try harder next year. And we promise we will. Let's recap some of our biggest stories, achievements, and favorite things of 07.Number of Posts: 265DBTH Income: $0.00 (we do it for the love)Story of the Year: Upstairs - Secret location, crazy emails on how to get in, Diddy Fights - it was the gift that kept on giving.Non-story of the Year: 1OAK. BTW, they are officially open. Favorite Nightspot: Tie - Beatrice Inn and Rose Bar. Hate on if you want, but we have fun whenever we go. That's what counts.Most Potential for 2008: Socialista. Best Event Space: Bowery HotelFavorite Drinks: FreemansDream for Next Year: More down and dirty margarita bars. Most Important Person(s) in Hospitality/Nightlife: Down By the HipsterNot to go on a rant here, but what we hear from you, our readers, is how much you enjoy this thing of ours. We enjoy it even more. So our promise to you is to come back even stronger in 2008. More posts, more parties, more pictures, more rumors, news, coverage, more everything. If we do that, then we think we may just win it again in 2008.Happy holidays and have a great new year.Humbly,DBTH

Too bad for Giants tight end Jeremy Shockey and his gal corralling buddy Bruno Fierce. Or is it? The Shockster and his pal went the craigslist way to round up a pack of ladies to \"surround his guys with the city’s hottest girls.\" Unfortunately for everyone involved, #80 broke his dancing leg. Fortunately for everyone, that means he has no NFL responsibilities left, which means he can take his NYE party to the next level. We just hope you ladies know how to cheer up a man with a busted wing. [Photo credit]

Want to know who designed 1OAK - the new super club by the super friends? Well, A Little Birdy knows and wants to share it with us. Isn't that sweet? From the LB: \"the designer of 1oak is Roy Nachum. He is Israeli and he is a hack. Most of his designs are Phillipe Starck 'inspired' ripoffs. You can see on his website... oversize lamp shades, golden guns, interior ivy walls. There is nothing original. All taken from Starck.\" Tell us how you really feel Birdy. So much for some holiday Birdy cheer. We would hate to have to fight you over a piece of bread. Scrolling through the pictures on his site does demonstrate he loves those big lamp shades and our other Little Birdy did say the club seems to cherry pick other hot spots from around the city. Color us unwilling to pick a side, because one Birdy's Starck is another's Roy Nachum. We think there is room for all of us in this nest.

If you spend all this money...you strive to make your money back! Taking the road already traveled is a lot less risky than being \"unique.\"Of course, it's all relative. Who is to say that Mr. Starck didn't rip off Joe Schmoe? Oversize lamp shades - yep, that's inspiring and original. Golden Guns - yep, that's a James Bond movie. Ivy walls - yep, the color ivory is unique, like elephant tusks and bar soap. So, this LB is missing the point that no one starts with a blank slate.

First, I just wanted to know who made you incharge to talk on behalf any design reporter or something like this?Second, I was in this club and actually knows this artist for a long time. The things that you are talking about doesn't make sense! So go back to your resources and learn about Starck designs and just after you did that try to compare it to other unique and talented young artists.

***CONTENT
After some joint work by DBTH and our friends at HotelChatter, the HC crew comes in with the final blow. Eric Goode and Sean McPherson, the hottest boutique hotel company this side of Jason Pomeranc, have apparently come to terms on the Riverview Hotel. According to an HC tipster:The Riverview Hotel was purchased by Sean and Eric for approx $33.0 Million recently. The Hotel is an SRO (Single Room Occupancy), which means that none of the rooms have their own bathrooms, sinks, kitchens or even basic amenities. The reason they are not accepting any reservations is b/c they would like to begin the process of removing any and all long term residents, most of which are homeless, drug addicts and drunks---similar to those you would find in the Whitehouse on the Bowery. By not allowing any new \"guests\" they limit their risk and exposure for new problems. They will have a very difficult time removing most of the long-term stays, especially since there are strict laws prohibiting the harassment of such individuals.Excellent point. But when there is a financial will, there certainly is a physical way. May we suggest hiring the Pinkertons, who we hear have been slowly rebuilding their forces somewhere in the mountains of West Virginia, waiting to be called on once again.

Last night, DBTH stormed the gates of Norwood to check out the lay of the land. No, we are not a member. No we don't consider ourselves to be trespassing thieves either. We were what most people you see inside a private club are: an invited guest. So what did we find? Not much. But not in a bad way. Confused? We are too. Basically Norwood is a converted townhouse on 14th Street. There are four floors.. First floor is check in, lower lounge and drawing/parlor room, and out back is a traditional English garden.. Second level is the restaurant, empty when we got there, empty when we left. The menu was full of hearty winter dishes, very similar to what you may find at the Waverly Inn these days. We would eat there.. Third floor is the upper parlor room, with a bigger bar, more couches, and a piano. A band was set to start a bit later in the evening to entertain the small crowd.. Fourth floor is the screening room, a very small place that seemed quite utilitarian. There were screenings of the new film Entrepreneur last night. That, dear readers, is all there is to it. Why we were there? Well, that's none of your bees wax. However, it did involve absinthe and that's all we're going to say. We learned there are about 380 active members so far with the hope to grow the list to 600 over the next year. The place is apparently quite busy during the week and over the weekend is used as a meeting place before going on to bigger and better things. The members we talked to are happy they have joined, but wouldn't all members say that? At least as first. The rooms were warm and cozy, and the bar selection was choice. Consider us willing to go back, but undecided on accepting a membership.

Finally, our Little Birdy checks in with a final update. After telling us all about the entrance, dance floor, bar, smoking patio, and the sexed up Bolivian bathrooms, our final installment deals with a more leisurely feature. We'll let our LB take it home, \"I just talked to a friend who was at the opening, and aparently they put in a pool table, a la Rose Bar. I can't figure out if these guys are good, or just glorified promoters/posers.\" Ah, the eternal question. Do any of you have any thoughts? Comments are welcome.

We are usually sick of the holidays by December 1st, so by December 15th we had really had our fill. After doing everything in our power to not attend another holiday party, a friend managed to snag our company at a little loft party going down in a choice loft in the heart of Soho. For that, we thank them. There really are few things better than a well thrown loft party, and this was right up there with the best of them. We are talking 3 stocked bars - 2 for alcohol and 1 for sushi. That's right, they had a full on sushi bar with fish provided by Nobu. Don't like fish? Get yourself a slice of Lombardi's pizza and saddle up for the entertainment, which in this case was a little person elf stripper (above) who was hired, we are guessing, to spread holiday cheer and expose himself. Fascinating. Despite the unwanted nudity, we had a smashing time, reminding us that holiday parties aren't all bad. Especially this one.

Below is the second part of a special 3 part expose on the newest crapspot to open on NYC's far West side. According to a Little Birdy who was there on opening night:The room with the fireplace overlooks the dance floor which is in front of the bar. The DJ booth is at the head of the dance floor, and as expected, is elevated over a small dance floor. The DJ was very good, and you could tell he wanted to play some really serious shit, but had to tone it down because of the finance crowd (80's rock and all). The dance floor has a few small tables, likely for VIPs. On the side opposite the letter wall there is some artwork of a boy with a crown blinding him on what looked like a canvas with lego bumps (same art as in Cafe Bari) I can't remember the artist's name, but he is a French guy (by way of Israel, I had a chance to chat with briefly). Beautiful artwork, and the main room has a double barreled vaulted ceiling that made you feel like you were in a doublewide version of Gold Bar. Boothes line the wall opposite the letter wall, and the U-shaped bar continues to wrap around to the floor that looks like a paino keyboard on ecstasy (as featured in NYT piece). The oddest part of the bar was a stadium style seating of Versialles style upholstered chairs that went up, probably 5 levels....I had heard they applied for a cabaret license, so I don't know if the idea was to rip off The Box and do shows, but that is to be seen. If you walk underneath the stadium seating. you can get to the back where you can go downstairs to the bathroom, which is a very cool part of the club. The wall looks like a Louis Vuitton bag because it's done in that type of brown with very fine gold pinstripes. The bathrooms are like hidden passages becuase it's hard to tell where to push on the wall to get it to open. The bathrooms are like being at Gold Bar. Single person bathrooms with locks which are great for bumping a line, or banging some girl you meet there. The faucets and sinks are gold, and there is a James-Bond style gold gun on the wall. Weirdest part was that there was Method soap dispensers (seemed out of place and may not be permanent). The VIP room was still under construction, but it looked pretty cool with a small bar and lounge area. The hallway leading to the VIP room has a wall that looks like they stacked burlap bags of U.N. rice to make the wall. I guess that's about it. It will definitely be a great place and tough to get into. But with everything moving out of MPD and into FiDi/TriBecca, I wonder what made them choose that location. It truly is in the middle of the projects. We don't condone the illicit drugs or public sex, but maybe that is what the fearsome foursome had in mind. Only time will tell. Coming up, the exciting conclusion to our Monday mini-series. Do stay tuned.

One minor technical nitpick: a cabaret license has nothing to do with live entertainment. According to New York law, a club must have a cabaret license or it cannot allow dancing within the premises.

Reports are trickling in from 1OAK, the new Meatpacking spot that some said wouldn't open until January. A Little Birdy was there last Thursday for the opening event, that's a December Thursday mind you, and filed a lengthy and complete report on what the set up isSo I went to 1OAK on Thursday night because the hedge fund I work at uses Bass Trading as a broker. . . the group of guys inside was the biggest bunch of finance geeks, although they tried their hardest to bring in the hottest girls from their firm (HR girls, Investor Relations, Admins). I'm a complete architecture and design freak, and my girlfriend always gets mad at me becuase I point out that one designer was trying to reference Gehry's guggenheim in Bilbao and shit like that. That being said, 1OAK is very well designed and I have no doubt it will be a huge success....it has some unique aspects, but it really takes the best features from the best places around the city. Richie and his crew clearly did their research. You walk in from the outside (which has been photographed a ton) and there's a qhaki colored rug on the floor feels almost like a golf green. There's a desk in front for reservations and the curtains separate the first room from the next room where the coat check is (on your left.) Then you walk into the main room. To your left is the infamous wall of (gold, although they didn't look gold leafed (yet?)) which was a very cool effect. It looked like there were about 10 layers of letters tacked on top of each other, and below that is about 3 booths. The booths were half moon shaped and could easily hold 6-8 people, looked like suede tan/brown leather and very comfortable. To your right is the bar, which is a U-shape and looks like it pays homage to Death and Co. because it has cursive carvings in the bar, and also overhead. A cool feature of the bar (which I think has been reported) is that it looks like there are piano legs on the corners. If you walked straight with the lettered wall on your left, and the bar on your right there is an elevated area with a fireplace in the corner and some chairs and couches. The coolest part of the place (in my opinion) was clearly taken from Buddah Bar. If you walk onto the patio, which is directly off the room with the fireplace, there is an alley in the back which has been mirrored to make it appear larger. This is there solely for people to smoke without having to go outside, the patio couldn't have been more than 4 or 5 feet deep and 10-12 feet long, but feels very large because of the mirrors).Mind you, this is just part I of III. Additional notes are on the way. But let it be known that 1OAK is ready to accept your hard earned ducats. It's going to be a big day.

It's Friday afternoon and we are still posting about 1OAK. It just opened last night and we already hate this place with a passion. But when we get the news, we share the news. And this is news. Another little birdy lets us know that the 1OAK crew is having themselves a private opening event tonight - invite only of course - that will be starting right as the 1 Model Management party is starting to wrap up. Our LB says, \"they are piggy backing on top of the model party to invite people to a private opening. That way it will be full of models since their party is early. Oldest move in the nightclub book.\" So a place called One of a Kind is using the oldest trick in the book? All of our illusions are shattered. Kids let this be a lesson in the cold hard facts of nightlife life. Just go be a banker or something. The nightclub business is all a farce. A farce!

Yeah, 1Oak hosted an event last night. And which company, pray tell, holds the honor of being able to say they christened the club? A Little Birdy checks in, saying \"it was a private corporate party for BTIG Trading. Hence, no models. I know this because my friend is the office manager at BTIG and she worked the list for the party-….cheers!\" There you have it. The traders have already staked their claim. We hope they all were given hats.

1OAK held it's first event last night. We'd like to thank our friends at Imbible for the photo, and we would like to thank fogul Barry Diller for building that alien sailboat on the West Side Highway, otherwise JG from Imbible wouldn't have been able to report:Seeing as how our fancy offices at the IAC building are just two blocks away from 1 Oak, I did a quick walk-by after work last night and snapped the above photo. Granted, it was early (around 7pm), but from what little I could glean, the first guests to christen the new bar were, well, dudes--and not male model dudes, but like average, unglamorous, finance-type of dudes. Maybe the models were stuck in traffic, or maybe I just happened to walk by just as One Model Management's accounting department was arriving--you know, so they could get in before the door became selective. Lucky for them, at least this early in the evening, it was not.Now, since they are hosting events in return for money, we are calling 1OAK officially open. January our blogging ass. Just because the public can't get in to dance to hip hop doesn't mean anything. Have a good weekend.

Nothing says D Bag like Donald Trump and Pete Wentz. While the two aren't very much alike, they are both pretty big D bags. At least that's what we we're going with today. Sorry myspace. So to have the two of them team up for one terrible promotion - even if they have absolutely nothing to do with it - is too lame for us not to mention. A Little Birdy forwarded us some news of a new promotion going down at Angels and Kings, Wentz's little bar in the East Village. Ladies, please pay extra special attention, as this one goes out to you:I'm the PR person for Angels & Kings (Pete Wentz, Fall Out Boy, Gym class Heroes, Panic at the disco own it) We are starting a promotion with Trump Vodka were the ladies get comp. trump 8-9 mon to sat. Free Trump vodka for an hour a night! Who is the ad wizard that came up with this one? Probably a D bag. We have already called CB 3 to let them know there may be a riot on East 11th Street 6 nights a week. Anyway, one of you fine ladies please order a Trump & Tonic for DBTH. Gratzi.

Hey everyone! Today is D Bag Thursday, a very special feature brought to you in at least two parts? Why today? Why not. Part 1.It's Wednesday night. You (or DBTH) is at the oh so swanky Rose Bar enjoying an $18 cocktail or two, and a group is seating at one of the side tables. And in this group, you notice many of the gentleman wearing the same hats. That's when you realize it's Scott Sartiano and his Butter posse, all wearing Butter hats. To the layman, it may seem they really just love butter. But we know it to be some kind of D baggy gorilla marketing campaign or whatever. And if you are going to wear a hat with the name of your restaurant and lounge on it, wouldn't it be 1OAK, your new space that's poised to open tonight? Those hats probably never made it back from the glitter factory so they went with the standby.In anther twist, we travel in the way back machine to the last time 1OAK was set to open. Well, they had to cancel their events and put the hype machine on hold for a bit. Our Little Birdy said at the time, \"saw Richie Akiva at Rose Bar last night. . . Anyway, I was expecting Richie to be doing something else when his new club is supposedly opening tomorrow night. I'm putting my money on December... if they're lucky.\" Ditto LB. Ditto.Photo from NY Times

Remember when we first told you about 1OAK, the new west side club that was to be owned and operated by a mega nightlife collective of partners. Well, it's ready to open. A much trusted Little Birdy tells us, \"I was speaking to a person closely connected with the club. They are ready to open, for real this time. The first event is tomorrow [Thursday] night, lock stock and smoking barrel. The owners and promoters are very excited about it.\" And why wouldn't they be. They put a lot of time, effort and sweet moolah into it. That doesn't mean that we are looking forward to going anytime soon. Have you been to Butter lately? Heh. Onward.

So do you have New Years plans yet? No? That's OK, you still have time to figure everything out. What's that? You want some suggestions from DBTH? Well, we don't play favorites, but may we suggest Upstairs? You heard us. Upstairs. Now, we've had our fun with the not-so-secret lounge above Cafe Bari. And they've made it pretty clear what they think about us. But it's cool. It's cool. New Years Eve is a different animal - especially in this town. And if you are going out, you want it to be big, and you want it to be great. The problem is so many people try to head out of town to avoid the masses that flock here. But we've been told by the Upstairs folks that just won't be the case at their event. They are predicting the regulars, and they are guaranteeing a good time. We kinda believe them. We don't know why but we do. So give them a chance. If we didn't already have plans, and if they took down our Wanted poster, we may consider it ourselves. If that's not your seen, maybe one of these will be. Got something else in mind? Do let us know.

Tis the season for sharing, so we were excited when our friends from HotelChatter checked in yesterday with a rumor they had heard a month back, saying \"we hear that some undercover construction work has started at the Hotel Riverview at 113 Jane St.\" They also wonder if the Riverview is \"Eric Goode and Sean MacPherson's new project.\" Oh, you mean this new project? What the HC team missed is that a certain doorman opened a certain Cuban themed bar and cafe in the Riverview basement. We're talking Socialista, and if this is true then we have found a mega project. It would fit with Goode and McPherson's penchant for rehab projects, but losing out on the bar/restaurant space with an already established operator is a tough sell for hoteliers that thrive on food and beverage service. Calls to the Riverview were met with expected gruffness, but we hope to learn more in the coming days. Happy Friday.

Oh, this is good... nice digging on this rumor. Scoop!FINALLY took my jaded hipster (ha) ass to Socialista on a whim earlier this week (aka an open bar event), and have to admit, the place is kinda cute....Until the mixed drinks switched over and became $15 (beers $9!). Then everyone in the place reverted back into suited douchelords.

Continuing our Super Scoop Thursday, a Little Birdy forwarded along a little afternoon shocker, saying \"Thought you'd want to be the first to know that PM Lounge will be shut down by the State Liquor Authority during January 2008.\" Little Birdy speaks the truth, according to this notice issued by the overlords of night at the State Liquor Authority. A quick perusal lists underage drinking, building code violations, noise, fighting, and much much more. That's no good. Especially when your Community Board and landlord already have a collective hard on to see your operation dissapear. May we suggest going to PM for New Years Eve, we think it could become a massive going out of business bash!The rest of the complaint is below.

Breaking news from boutique hotel land. We have long heard rumors that Eric Goode and Sean McPherson, stars of such projects as the Bowery Hotel and the Lafayette House Hotel, were working on deals for additional downtown hotel properties. Well, great success. The boys have apparently settled on their next project, with a Little Birdy who is most definitely in the know reporting, \"Sean McPherson and Eric Goode have closed the deal on a new hotel. It will be 'boutique-y' and in the West Village.\" That's it? Nothing more? Well, not yet, because the project is a wee bit sensitive. We expect to learn more soon, or have one of the so-called reporters from a major paper just steal our headline and go snoop around for answers. Because that's how they do. Happy fing holidays.

Due a previous engagement, we had to skip the final night of the 2007 Cirpriani Music Series. Luckily, we had a very special Little Birdy on hand to follow a very special report. Without further hesitationThe fabulous and the fabulously wealthy were in attendance tonight at the final edition of this season's Cipriani Condert Series at Cipriani Wall St. After dinner and before performances by George Michael and Aretha Franklin, the annual live auction was held to raise money for for UNICEF and the Sarah Ferguson Foundation. Fergie herself (the original Fergie, Dutchess of York) presided over the auction. After an introduction by Jeff Gordon and between witty exchanges with the lewd, but oh-so-entertaining Hugh Hildesley of Sotheby's, Fergie took to calling out those in the audience, such as Harvey Weinstein, Sir Richard Branson, and Ron Pearlman, who hesitated to reach into their deep pockets. Guests bid on a Masarati Granturismo ($130K), a walk-on part in Harvey Weinstein's next film ($105K), and tea with the Dutchess ($80K), among others raising $840K.Imagine paying $100K to walk on in a movie that probably won't gross that much. Boom. Anyway, our LB tells us that George Michael brought the house down with his performance and that it was a great way to wrap up the year. Good for you Cipriani. Good for you.

Yesterday, a little story made the rounds that Ian Schrager had purchased a building on Canal Street with plans to construct a W Hotel. Now, that's just umpossible, with the reason being Schrager has recently entered into a very long term deal with Marriott to jointly develop properties. Guess who owns W? Not Marriott! Scratch that idea. However, we do believe that this hotel could be a Schrager and Co. target. Why? Well, his old partner Morgans Hotel Group is bringing Ian's baby the Mondrian just to the West. Wouldn't it make Ian happy to grab a slice of the Chinatown pie and stick it to his old foes? DBTH says yes. But Morgan's definitely wins the locational battle, unless Ian's potential customers book rooms based on a need to catch the Chinatown bus. We're sticking with this one.

Because Ian makes lovely things happen... hence the Grammercy Hotel.And I also think that this rumor could have a shred of truth to it... for years, Ian tried to buy that old Andy Warhol hangout space (the original \"Factory\") in the LES, but the owners kind of screwed him and his other partners at the last minute. He LOVES that area of town.Plus it's well-known that there's a W going in on/near Eldridge near Canal Street.

Those crazy kids at Sixpoint have done gone and done it again. A company rep dropped a line, informing us of a new specialty ale they are rolling out for a limited time. This particular brew was created with a little help from Park Slope's Gorilla Coffee. To the release, which says:Gorilla Warfare Porter is a silky smooth porter made with 40 pounds of Park Slope's Gorilla Coffee Ethiopian Yirgacheffe blend, a Fair Trade and Organic Certified coffee roasted in Sunset Park, Brooklyn. The coffee has winey, spicy notes with hints of baker's chocolate. Combined with patent malt, the signature of many great English-style porters, this is one silky smooth, coffee-rich porter.Chrondo! The Porter will be available around town for about 6 weeks so you best act fast. Oh, and there is a kickoff party tomorrow night at Gorilla Coffee at 8 PM. Enjoy

Via our friends at HotelChatter, we come across the Gramercy Park Hotel's New Year's Eve special. Per the GPH's website, the offer includes Enjoy unique luxury accommodations, dinner for two at Wakiya, champagne and truffles, and guaranteed access to the Rose Bar. This package starts at $975, but we can't tell if this is some kind of deal or not. Even though the hotel is sold out for New Years, we assume it's mostly tourists. Even if you live in the city, are you and a mate want to really live it up, is a crappy meal at a crappy Chinese restaurant and being shoved around at Rose Bar the way you want to do it? We guess no. Is guaranteed entry enough? Still probably no. But to each their reach. We expect a full report on 1/1.

Norwood, that bastion of high society members only club on West 14th Street, inspired a bevy of comments last week. But more on that another time. Another Little Birdy, also not a member, stopped by this weekend and snapped this dark, blurry photograph from inside the joint. Honestly, we can't really tell what we are seeing here. It looks kind of empty in there, with a lot of guys wearing sweaters. Kind of like that club that Dan Akroyd was banished from in Trading Places. But isn't that what you are paying for when you join? It is, it is.

What: Ubuntu Loft PartyWhere: 446 BroadwayOn a chilly Saturday night in an old loft building way down on Broadway, the Ubuntu Education Fund held its annual loft party. Ubuntu develops education and health programs for the children of and around Port Elizabeth, South Africa. Today, they reach over 40,000 children with life-saving health and educational resources and services. No only are they making an incredible impact in South Africa, they can throw one hell of a party. We rang the buzzer and the door to the elevator suddenly opened. We stepped into the freight and went up several levels, walking into a well appointed loft and a party that was just getting started. The bar was open and stacked, and the food was good and plentiful. Rumor has the Blue Ribbon boys provided it. Nice. We danced, we drank, we caught up with old friends, and at the end of the night we tried to help out. Tis the season, no? Yes it is.

It's here. The folks from the Sunburnt Cow and Bondi Road have unleashed the time honored Aussie tradition of Toss the Boss on Lower Manhattan. To celebrate, they threw a little kick off party at both locations. We chose the Cow to coincide with out later plans, and indeed, the boss was tossed. They event went out and got themselves an ice slide for some overly-phallic ice shots. No thanks. We drank, we sampled some food, and at the end of the night, the barkeep ripped up our bill. You know why? Because we chose Coat of Arms. That's why! Good on ya.

Last night, we were invited by the good folks at Radar to a little shimmy at Socialista, Armin's little commie outpost on the edges of the West Village. It was our first time being there, and we have to say we were quite taken with the place. Downstairs is for the food, and upstairs is for the drink. You know where we're heading. To the doorman, where we rolled +1, and we bound up the short flight of stairs and to the main level. There was quite a crowd waiting to check their coats, obvious rookies when the skies turn gray, but pushing through led us to paydirt.Socialista does look like a fantasy version of Havannah. High ceilings, slow turning fans, loose strewn chairs. They hit some nice design touches. We grabbed a drink and grabbed a leather couch by the DJ booth. Comfy. The music was chill, the crowd was chill, the vibe was good. After a few hours, we snuck out the door and into the chill. There were still people maneuvering to get in, but the going was tough. Oh well. We stopped off at a local jaunt for a nightcap and called it a night.We would love to show you some pictures, but they were not allowed. Spy-tech is on the way.

First Jason Pomeranc. Now Space. Harrah's Rio Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas is on a deal making spree, poised to sign an agreement with Space, Ibiza's long running dance club to become the anchor nightlife tenant in the off-strip pink and purple tower. Semi-genius and semi-risky, as Rio is definitely at the bottom of destinations for twenty somethings that flock to Vegas to destroy themselves, but will the name Space bring any cachet this far from the Spanish Islands? Doubtful, but it may not matter. Rio needs a first class operator who knows how to produce on a large scale, and Space certainly fits that bill. Expect Carl Cox, Pete Tong and the rest of the Mega DJ set to start calling the Rio their home when they make their appearances in the desert. Just make sure your glow sticks are fired up.

Speaking of crappy private clubs - we check in on Norwood, the \"private members club providing a stylish and comfortable meeting, eating and drinking haven in the heart of New York City to a sophisticated and international clientele of influential opinion-formers in the creative arts world.\" Right. Set to open in the Andrew Norwood House (get it?), the anticipation for this club hasn't been building since New York ran an item about it in April. Hoping to rival the very successful Soho House model, Alan Linn, an ex-manager of a London club, has quietly opened his West 14th Street club. First reports are quite negative, with a Little Birdy telling us. \"Went to Norwood on Saturday. Not cool. Lame. Dead Empty.\" Pow pow pow.We're cheering for Alan and the entire Norwood team, but we have our doubts about this one. Besides the obvious douchebaggery of private clubs in general and their lack of a full service hotel and pool, this is just a place where the public can't come in and spend money. But it is a place where you can pay a membership fee to sit in a room and chit chat. Who wouldn't want that?

Clarify: the little birdy paid a membership fee and is subsequently complaining? What were they planning on paying for? Isn't the whole point of a prive club to be \"exclusive\" -- thus, \"quiet and dead\" is what you are paying for...not loud, crowded, and a fire-hazard like many of the bars/clubs DBTH either promotes, or ostensibly attends socially.

I have frequented soho house for years (sans membership bc i dont need one) and they have an extensive cocktail list, nice restaurant, great common area to come and work/hang out during the day/meetings etc.. they have their shit together regardless of whether it is a crap idea to have a private club at least they have a vision.

The building and furniture are beautiful; the place is filled with both art and people in the arts; the crowd is interesting; the food is great; the wines and cocktails are there for the choosing but no more expensive than any other restaurant of its kind.

been to Norwood maybe 10 times.the building itself is beautiful when its allowed to show through, as it is in the ground floor bar. my favorite place, though some of the furniture tries too hard.2nd floor dining room is a beautiful space sadly decorated in poor taste, its not a disaster, but a wasted opportunity - with cheap looking tables, silly pointy back chairs and probably the worst designer mirrors ever to be seen. (many of them). should throw all that out and start over in this room. They doubtless spent a lot of money on these items, but quite frankly would have done far better letting the original room show, and getting a bunch of old tables on ebay, a la Freemans... upstairs bar has some sort of 'risque' leather theme going on, with an island bar and some weird canopy thing above it - moroccan? medieval? +'sexy' sculptures dotted around. looks like some middle age gay fantasy gone awry. again a wasted opportunity, as its a lovely room, trying to play nightclub.top floor has decent media room, but should have gone for it like the House, and put in those great screening room seats.food. not as good as it should be. was too pricey. they eased back on that recently, but really - this is manhattan - wake up and get someone radical in the kitchen! bar food is a good idea, but you know if you are going to offer a lobster roll with potato chips, then toast that roll, and use good kettle chips. not a soggy bun and cheap chips. These details cost nothing and make all the difference!overall - I don't know who the designer was, or who chose them, or how lauded/'award winning' he/she was, but they screwed it up. The special charm of these places is that they are a privileged opportunity to be in an astonishing beautiful brownstone, and relax in that vibe. I don't want another gay themed leather bar, or designer restaurant, I want to be in an authentic listed brownstone... and soak in that on every floor.hopefully they will take some action, bite the bullet and throw out the crapola designer stuff, use art instead of mirrors, no puffy wing back chairs, remove carpets wherever possible, and let the house show through...

The first floor bar is really great, well designed, relaxed, great art! Richard Prince, anyone? Excellent Chandelier! The second floor mirrors are very cool. Fresher than The Viceroy in LA, and a welcome change to other places. They started off empty so they wouldn't add a bunch of trendy losers who would run off just as fast... The staff knows your name! Food is far better than it has to be in a private club. Nice to get away from lines, rude maitre d's and the crush of the trendy. Prices could be kinder, but not extraordinary. Nice art events, people behaving well for a bunch of stylish drinkers! At night sometimes the fourth floor really lights up - DJ, celebs comfortable in the privacy, a good number of gays also comfortably glowing in the private limelight. Smokers on the roof, all in all - you usually wish you were there instead of where ever...I guess its cooler to hate everything on the blogosphere. But this place doesn't try too hard, has no harsh tone, so I thought I'd say it like it is!

Jason Pomeranc is at it again. New York, LA, Toronto, Washington DC. JP and his Thompson Hotel group are busy expanding like crazy, replacing Morgans Hotel group as the new hot boutique company. So we ask ourselves again: What's next? Well, Las Vegas of course. A Little Desert Birdy, a black necked stilt perhaps, checks in, saying \"Jason Pomeranc has inked a deal with the Rio Hotel to develop a boutique hotel inside the Rio tower.\" Interesting Little Stilt. Very interesting. You would think that Sir Jason would avoid lending his name to a second rate Vegas property. But, dealmakers need to make deals, and getting business this close to the Strip takes more capital than the Thompson Group could put together. A shrewd play by a hotelier who is quickly emerging as a national player in this here game. Developing.

Yesterday, Page Six the Magazine had an article by our good friend and contemporary .Joshua David Stein peering into the oh so exclusive and utterly boring realm of the Supper Club, the new members only party circuit put together by London socialite Tamsin Lonsdale. Once every so often, these private little groups pop up, and like clockwork quickly go away. You know why? Because they are utterly unnecessary. You may think its big, but socially, New York City is quite small. Everyone knows most everyone (excluding yours truly), and when you travel to LA, London, Vegas or Miami, its more of the same. Adding Facebook, ASmallWorld and the rest of the so-called social networking communities to the mix just makes these private clubs irrelevant. So why do they continue to exist? Because corporations see them as the perfect luxury marketing tool. Tamsin explains so herself. Get 1000 rich people on a list, invite them to parties, and hope your brand catches on. Does it work? No. But it is impressive that this counts as work for some people. More power to you. But after paying your membership fees and being seated at a table at Nobu with 12 guys from UBS for a Supper Club event, you will probably wonder what happened to the exclusivity you were promised. Our guess is back in London, having champagne coolies at Boujis and laughing about it with the old world folks on the other side of the pond.

Speaking of tough tables, it looks like PrimeTime Tables, the service that provides members with \"hard-to-get reservations at leading dining venues\" has run into a problem with their business model. It seems members are bailing on their reservations. A Little Birdy sent along an email that PTT sent to its members, saying:We are aware that at this time of the year you have a lot of events ,cocktails and dinner parties to attend and are trying to be at more than one place at a time. We also know that this is the time of the year where dinner reservations are the most difficult for everyone to get and using PTT to secure that reservation is a smart way to go. However asking for a reservation or securing a reservation from the website and NO SHOW will not be accepted as it simply destroys the business and the relationship we have built with a lot of restaurants over the years. This email is sent to all our members and is not meant to attack anyone in particular, but we have received calls lately from restaurant that our Member did not show up. Each time this happens it affects our relationship and the capability to accommodate the next member to that restaurantAs PTT is a web community, and its business is based on trust. You trust us when we confirm your reservation, we need to trust you that you will show up once you acquire a reservation.To try to stop from happening again we need to implement a rule that will maybe stop the NO SHOW and affects every other member. The rule is as follows: 1 No show = 2 months no access to the website2 No show= membership cancelled.We thank you for your time and understanding.Boom! Threatening your own customers - we like your gumption PTT. But if your clients are such busy, important people that they can't bother making their own reservations, why would they bother to cancel either? Answer: They wouldn't. If you are willing to buy a table, than surely that fee includes the right to bail without notice. Apparently not.

What: Opening of Planet Hollywood Resort & Casino, Where: Las Vegas, NVWhen we told you we were out of town, you knew it had to be for a good reason. This past weekend, Planet Hollywood founder Robert Earl opened his Planet Hollywood Resort & Casino in Las Vegas on the site of the old Aladdin. Of course DBTH was invited. The opening party was supposed to be in the Opium Group's new Prive nightclub, but since it wasn't finished, the Fire Marshall nixed it and Friday's night festivities were canceled. Bummer fer sure. To make due, Saturday's party was moved to the Opium Group operated Living Room lounge, which meant jam packing all of the celebs in attendance into an area that held less than 150 people. Samantha Ronson dj'ed and Mickey Avalon performed. Also in attendance: Kevin Spacey (hammered), Emmanual Lewis (!!!), Sly Stallone, Elaine Lancaster, Anthony Michael Hall, David Hasselhoff, Gene Simmons and Nick Kroll (star of Cavemen). A-List all the way around. Due to the small space, the party became more of a free for all then a normal pack a room kind of thing. This wasn't a seen and be seen. This was a drink and get drunk. Which we and everyone else did. We can't venture how this place will do, but we aren't too worried about it. Vegas is Vegas. Adding a dose of Hollywood won't change that.

Early reports from The Smith, the new Third Avenue restaurant from Glenn Harris and Jeffrey Lefcourt (Jane), are giving the word that it's all bubbles. How's that? Yes, the restaurant is going green by not serving bottled water, and for those that want some gas with their H2O, Smith is serving up a house blend free of charge. How nice. The rub? The water is not very good. The mix of CO2 and water is off, giving you a drink that isn't quite bubbly and isn't quite flat. Not to critique, because we appreciate the effort, but it is hard to mess up water. But it is free, so you get what you pay for. Drinks from the bar were above average, with beers coming in a $5 a pint, and bartenders still trying to get a handle on how each specialty cocktail was made. One member of our party ordered the same drink 3 times, with it coming up twice and on the rocks once. The food was very solid. May we suggest the schnitzel? We just did.Obviously, The Smith is brand new. Kinks are being worked out. It doesn't mean The DBTH can't tell you how it is.

I live a block away. The food is very good, upscale, comfort food. It is an adult restaurant, the area needs more of these types of places that DO NOT cater to NYU students. Sat. night I had to wait 45 minutes for my reserved table, but the bar was fun and the food was worth the wait. Don't skip dessert!

What are we thankful for? The helpful and crafty bartender at Freemans who whipped us up a Tequila Old Fashioned, a tasty twist on a classic cocktail. Made with Don Julio and a smoky punch, it certainly added a pleasant cheer to our already rosy fall disposition. Two or three of these Benito Juarez's (as we have dubbed it), and you are feeling no pain. But remember, everything in moderation. Right? Right.

Although we were out of town this weekend, a friend who was visiting New York Saturday night asked us for the location of Upstairs. Naturally, we quickly sent it over with a bit of advice. \"When you approach the door, tell Wayne DBTH sent you.\" Now, when we suggested this, we had a feeling it would not help. But we wanted to test it out. Below is a transcript of what happened. So, I showed up at the front door of Upstairs and asked for Wayne. He said, \"I'm Wayne\". I said \"Hey man. My friend DBTH told me to come by and ask for you\". He immediately started freaking out. \"What? You're kidding right?\" I started smiling thinking that he wasexcited that I used DBTH's name and that he was going to let me right in. Lets just say that it was the complete opposite of what I thought.\"You know DBTH?\"\"Of course I know DBTH, a great friend and a genius.\"\"He's a genius\" he said obviously heated. \"a genius?\" He's not a genius, he put my phone number up on his blog. Do you know how many phone calls I received from that, do you know how annoying that is? I have been opening private clubs for years now and never has anybody done this\"\"Yeah, but any publicity is good publicity right? Also, they didn't post your full number. I just want to check it out to see I can tell them something good about this place.\"\"No, I'm sorry, you should leave.\"\"OK then man. Nice talking to you.\"Wow. Just wow. It's funny because we didn't post anyone's full phone number. We would never do that. What's more funny is we have been to Upstairs and were let in by Wayne himself. And while we appreciate our friends sticking up for us, we don't consider ourselves a genius by any stretch. But everyone enjoys a compliment, including Wayne, who we know is doing a heck of a job.

What: Johnnie Walker Blue Label Tasting Where: Atrium at the Time Warner CenterJohnnie Walker Blue Label. Otherwise known as the Good Stuff. Last night, to celebrate the season and the opening of its own engraving studio, the Johnnie Walker family and Diageo Spirits held a little tasting event at the Time Warner Center. Oh hell yeah. DBTH +1 and in we went. They had tented off the 2nd floor atrium in the mall and created their own little lounge. We headed straight for the VIP couch section and settled in for a few hours of \"tasting\". Blue Label neat. Blue Label rocks. Blue Label mojito. If it was Blue Label, it was DBTH. The area was littered with HBO celebs, including Jamie Lynn Siegler, who for some reason was drinking white wine. Lame. Then some master whiskey man came over with a $27,000 bottle of whiskey and led a small tasting event. Wild stuff. After a few hours, our heads were swimming in Blue. It's that special kind of buzz that re-affirms that life really is good. Especially when you are DBTH.

Do you work at GoldBar? If no, that's too bad. If yes, then we hear that someone has an early holiday gift for you. Izzy Gold, the bad ass clothing makers and sometime DJ's at the swanky spot on Broome, has created a special t-shirt just for GoldBar staff and friends. Swanky. So if you are a GoldBar Elite, congrats. You get a t-shirt. If not, you can stop by the new Blue and Cream store on the Bowery to peruse some of their other goods, none of which are as special as this t-shirt.

Pictured above is the smallest, yet most exclusive table in town. People wait for up to 30 minutes just to get their turn. Notice the graffiti? The view is crappy, the chair uncomfortable, and man is it loud. Yet people wait and wait for it every night. Give up? It's the table inside the Beatrice Inn's bathroom. Now do you see? Ah.

What: I'm Not There Where: Upstairs at the Bowery HotelIt sure was a busy night on the circuit. Normally we don't double book, but for this we made an exception. The Bowery staff cleared out the riff raff from New York's Look Magazine party to prepare for the A list bash that was scheduled to arrive at 9:30. Harvey brought the entire hit squad from his company's latest film, I'm Not There, the Todd Haynes Dylan biopic. Players included Harvey W., Heath Ledger, Richard Belzer, Todd Haynes, Adrian Grenier, Christine Vauchon, Val Kilmer, and DBTH. You know how we do.The scene? The crowd was in high spirits after the screening. Most made a bee line for the small buffet. We went for the bar, as is our wont. Our selection? Limited. Belvedere, Heineken, Red/White or Champagne. Uh? Is this 1997? We struggled with our choice, but finally managed to make a selection. We know that Belvedere paid good money provide the booze, but this was unacceptable. Again, the sheer size of the space makes this our favorite venue in the City. There is just so much room and so many rooms that a party can really go every which way. This one was very mellow with an upbeat twist. The backroom started to get a bit cloudy towards the end of the night, and we decided that we had had enough. Doing double duty sure does take its toll. Pictures of the party and venue embedded below. Enjoy.

What: Microsoft Zune OriginalsWhere: Skylight StudiosA bit of Deja Vu for you. Skylight was white, bright, and filled with people who corporations think can influence your shopping habits and preferences. Ah, trend setters. Certainly, you wouldn't normally notice these, the pretty mixed in with the beautiful. But there they all were, patiently waiting in line for a free Zune while Peter and Bjorn (sans their triplet John) spun the Stones.We were there, too, cradling our scotch and later our gin, enjoying the BLT passed hors d'oeuvres and chatting up the girl beside us who was working on a book about breast satisfaction. We didn't have the heart to tell her that if heard one concept on breast satisfaction, you've heard them all. Regardless, we felt enamored with the four-sided open bar and the robot-inspired art lining the walls that we had engraved on the back of our shiny new Zune. Delivery expected in 7-10 days. How nice. On a bleary November Tuesday, Zune and the gang certainly threw us a good party. We were full, we were tipsy, and we walked away with a shiny new toy. The music was good, the people were lovely, and we had an all around good time.

We love Six Point Ales. The beers are tasty, and they are local. Last night they introduced a new flavor - 8 Days of Wheat - at the Whole Foods Beer Room, and stopped by for a taste test. We have to admit, it's pretty darn good. In the press release, Sixpoint brewmaster Shane C. Welch says \"Eight Days O’ Wheat’ features a soft, tart wheat flavor and a mild hop bitterness. At a relatively low 5.3% ABV, this beer was brewed to be shared both among friends and for those times when you want to kick back and enjoy a few beers in one sitting.” Whatever, drink enough and you will get drunk. Fact. Supply is limited.UPDATE: Jeff from Sixpoint checks in, saying \"The Sixpoint Craft Ales 8 Days of Wheat will be made exclusively for Whole Foods for a good long while, not a \"limited time\". So, yea, get it while it's hot, but there will always be more made for the procrastinators.\"

Not to be outdone by their cross town rivals, it seems that after a bit of embarrassment, Noah T. and Jason S. are getting back to business. This time, they are sharing the spotlight with the Jigga himself, Jay Z. A little birdy files a report from the desert, saying \"Jay-Z's 40/40 is opening at the Venetian's new Palazzo Resort Hotel and Casino on December 20, 2007. What isn't known is that Jay will be sharing the nightlife spotlight with a two-story restaurant and lounge (maybe NY's Stanton Social) run by Tao managing partners Jason Strauss and Noah Tepperberg of Strategic Group, as well as with a full-scale nightclub and live music venue.\" Talk about a stacked lineup. We imagine that investors have been desperate to get the Strategic boys involved with another Vegas spot, especially since Tao is the most profitable establishment in the country. The Palazzo was a natural fit. However, we aren't sure if the Stanton Social brand is strong enough to make it on a Vegas level, but Strategic certainly has the weight to pull it off. We shall see.

It was the place no one knew about. Well, except for us. But Gild Hall, the former Holiday Inn in the Financial District, is getting ready to make its debut. You can be there to experience it all. For a not so small fee of course. The Thompson Hotel group's newest location is taking reservations for December and the rates are far from introductory. For the weekend of December 14-16, a standard room at the Gild can be had for $429 a night, not including taxes. Hoochie mama! But if you are going for it, we suggest the King Suite for an even $800. Description below: Bright 12 foot high ceiling corner suites with oversized living area and wet bar. The spacious living room has smoked glass pendant chandeliers. Elegant designed wooden furniture inspired by the French Fashion House Hermes. Suspended from the ceiling hangs an elegant, custom designed chandelier. The separate bedroom features a luxurious leather headboard, a king size bed. Suspended from the ceiling hangs an elegant, custom designed chandelier.You had us at headboard. No word on when Todd English's restaurant will open, but you can get some lunch at Backyard Chicken. It's just around the corner. Don't forget a napkin - we wouldn't want you getting grease on the Hermes furniture.

I booked this hotel through Priceline- and stayed there Dec 7-10, 2007. **This hotel is currently under MAJOR construction.** The hotel description and photos are NOT accurate. **There is no restaurant, no room service, no gym, no bar, no gift shop, no business center, no periodical and CD lending libraries, on-demand movies, no video games, no coffee makers, no computer safes, no minibars, and no terry cloth robes. **We were awakened by jack hammers at 9:00am each morning, as they are \"renovating\"!!!**. We were not previously notified of this, and the hotel claimed that Priceline was to blame for this. This was EXTREMELY upsetting and disturbing for our long weekend holiday vacation.On the upside- the staff were friendly and helpful. They offered to get us a free car to the airport, and offered us a discount next time we choose to stay there (after renovation is completed of course). The hotel is in a great location, very near Wall St station, and the cafe across the street was good. The rooms were very clean, and the beds were comfortable- even in the unrenovated rooms. The showers and bathrooms were also nice.I would stay there again- ONCE CONSTRUCTION IS COMPLETED

A Monday morning shocker. Just days after christening the pool at the El San Juan, Eugene Remm, Mark Birnbaum and the gang have struck a major deal, agreeing to take over David Rabin's Lotus and giving it a full Tenjune style makeover. Our Little Birdy tells us that the plans include using the ground floor - street level space into a restaurant and maintaining the basement as a club space. This is a major shakeup in Meatpacking land, as one of the area's pioneers packs it in and officially passes the torch to the new kings of NYC nightlife. We just hope we aren't getting STK 2. As for Rabin, well, even he admits it isn't what it used to be. It sure ain't.

Those of you in the know surely know about Toss the Boss, the Aussie version of Flip Night, that has achieved legendary status from its origins at the Coogee Beach Palace. Never been? That's a damn shame. We suggest making a trip. But we have some good news. Toss the Boss is coming to NYC. Huzzah! Aussie bars Bondi Road and the Sunburnt Cow are going to unleash TtB as a Happy Hour specialty. Rules are simple: order some drinks, bartender flips a coin, and if you call it correctly the drinks are on the house. Make ours a Toohey's and we will be all set. Starts December 1, so do feel free to check it out.

Have you been practicing music with your wanna be band at home, thinking that you are ready to make the plunge and record your first demo in an actual studio? Of course you have. Don't lie. You could very well be the next Justice. Or Hootie. So when choosing where to record, there really is only one option. At least to us. That's Blue Ribbon Sound. It's not the equipment, engineers or equipment that makes it our choice. It's the availability of Blue Ribbon catering during your sessions. Uh, Duck BLT's and oysters all around. Now your living like a rock star, even if you don't get signed.

Information is starting to trickle in from Tenjune's throwdown in that beacon of luxury, Puerto Rico. As we start to put together what really went down, may we please direct you to the fuzzy photos, half sentences and general nonsense of Jennifer Birn's blog, Simply Jen, on OK Magazine's website. It's a great way to catch up on some of the hottest events going on all over the globe. Or better yet, in New York and Puerto Rico. Jen drops Nick Lachey's name at least 5 times in her recap of the weekend, who's name was so widely attached to the event we wonder why it wasn't called Nick Lachey's Wild Puerto Rican Nightclub Adventure Weekend. That's got a nice ring to it. Jen's weekend involved champagne, staring at Nick Lachey, losing some money, winning some money, sponsored Grey Goose drinks and of course Nick Lachey, including this memory:I ended up back at the blackjack tables where I played sitting between a TV writer and Nick Lachey until they closed down the tables at 4am - but this time I was at the table before Nick joined - and the minimum bet was only $15. Nick’s great. He’s sweet, fun and knows how to play blackjack (even if we did all get our money taken away by the casino’s less than sympathetic dealers).Aww, that sucks. At least you got to spend more time with Nick Lachey. More details to follow.

If you are a promoter, its a good thing. He probably doesn't cost that much to book and from all accounts is easy to work with.If you are a nightlife consumer, he is a liability. He and other celebrities (or is it all celebs?) don't ever add anything to a party except for less seating and restricted movement.

Date: February 18, 2007Location: Downtown It was at that time and place where DBTH first made it's entrance to the world of rocking your face off. We announced that Robert De Niro had lured his good buddy and business partner Agostino Sciandri from SoCal to open a branch of Ago in his new Greenwich Hotel. We also told you some poor sap would be jamming a bunch of wine corks into a ceiling panel to accentuate the design. Fun stuff right? We think so too. The world picked up on it and the rest is DBTHistory. Well, the whole shebang is getting close to opening, and we are proud to unveil some quality shots from inside the space. Please pay special notice to the arched ceiling and old world masonry work in the top image, as well as those corks both in the panels and then installed high above in the proceeding frames. Those hand crafted bricks look real good. And for the panels, a Little Birdy has an update, telling us \"there are only 100,000 corks and they were gotten from a branch of the Canadian girls scouts that collected and sold them for charity.\" Naturally.

Jason Pomeranc and his band of hotel building family members are in the midst of a major expansion. They just opened Six Columbus, the Gild is coming soon, and they are now pushing into other cities. Including Washington DC. That's where the name Donovan comes in. As in Donovan House. That's the name of the new hotel Sir Pomeranc will be opening on 14th Street in our nation's capital. Wonderful. The project, which is a converted Holiday Inn (sounds familiar), is partly financed by LaSalle Hotel Properties with the design work being done by Studio Gaia, the design force behind Tao Vegas and the now shuttered club Light. We are proud to present you with a first look at what the Donovan will look like. Think classic-post mod with a nod to the shagadelphic era of hotels past. You get what we're talking about. Expected opening is Spring of 2008, but with so many new projects coming on line at the same time, we think you can expect some delays.

In a stunning surprise, we ended up at the Halloween Bash at the Bowery Hotel's event space. This place was operating at its Full Monty. How can they have a space this big? How come it's never open? So many rooms, so much outdoor space, so many bars. It was packed with people, so many many people, all in costumes and seemingly enjoying themselves. Some fuzzy memories:. Multiple bars in multiple locations - short waits. Whiskey on the rocks - $11. Heineken - $9. Yes, there is something wrong with that. Paul Sevigny's band has some work to do. Too many Amy Winehouse costumes. This bar needs to be openedPhotos will be coming soon. Just not now. DBTH is tired and needs to recharge. Egggh. We can tell you one thing for certain - we're happy that Halloween is over. Fa Real.

Who would ever want to pay $9 for a beer? Not us. But we paid, b/c that was the going rate. What was more odd that a premium liquor was only $2 more. We would have surely gone for something darker on the rocks and gotten more value for the order.Not that a Heiny isn't valuable. But at $9, we weren't going back for a second round.

Noble Food and Wine has been making a go of it since this summer. The restaurant game is a tough slag, so you have to do anything and everything possible to differentiate yourself from the competition. It seems that Noble has gone and commissioned a fancy play list from Producer & DJ du jour Mark Ronson to set the music mood. How do we know? Their publicist told us, saying that \"with . . . custom play lists by Mark Ronson, NOBLE exemplifies New York’s downtown-chic style.\" Now, Ronson's play lists may in fact exemplify the crapiness that is downtown's current style. We're not sure. But we do know that having a CDJ make a mix for you is not going to make or break your restaurant. We suggest saving the money and knocking a dollar or two off those $9 glasses of wine. But unlike this PR campaign, our advice is free. Keep the change.

We've all had a bit of time to kill before an appointment, engagement or what have you. Is there a better way to spend it than having a quick pop at a local joint? Of course not. Let's begin. Welcome to Spitzer's Corner, a lively joint that recently opened at the sleepy little corner of Ludlow and Rivington. That's in the Lower East Side. You may have heard of it. Anyway, while waiting for an additional friend to join our party, we happened upon the place and decided to drop in for a drink. First, we loved the front room set up. It's chaotic, it's wooden, it's fun. The two main tables and bar were packed, but there was plenty of room to sit on the surrounding benches on the side. Very resourceful use of space. It took a few minutes for our waitress to come by, but that gave us a bit more time to choose our beverages from the lengthy beer menu. Old Speckled Hen for us. The drinks arrived shortly thereafter, and while a bit too cold for a proper Hen, it was still damn tasty. At $6, also not too outrageous. Our friend arrived just as the round ended. Our waitress reappeared with the bill and we were on our way. All in all, the Spitz was the perfect Drop In.

There were a heap of promotable parties held this past weekend. Apparently they were pretty crowded. In some cases they were so crowded that people that wanted to be in there, or were supposed to be in there, could not get in. Not good at all. We took a different route. We donned a costume and made our way out to Brooklyn, where a full throw down was in force. Not only did this party have candy corn, booze and costumes, it also had music. Live music. We're talking full bands set up inside the space with enough room for 50 people to dance. That's impressive. That's Halloween.We had a rollicking good time, as we almost always do. Special thanks to our hosts for inviting us.

It's Monday morning. YAY! Time for another edition of Quick Hits. You're probably pretty tired so we will make it quick.1. It's tough to be the new guy on the block, especially in the East Village Hot Dog war. Good Dog, the upstart newcomer on St. Marks Place, may be done for. A Little Birdy says, \"walked by Good Dog late Saturday night, there is newspaper covering the glass door and wall.\" It was going to be an uphill battle to beat the neighborhood statesmen Crif Dog, and it looks like Good Dog has lost the good fight. Thankfully, their large dog mascot still remains.2. A very special Little Birdy filed a report from Max Fish, saying \"I was just walking out of one of the nasty bathrooms at Max Fish when I overheard a guy in the bar say: 'I would never fuck a girl who peed in that bathroom'. Too bad for me.\" Yes too bad. Too bad.3. Finally, a tale from our own weekend. As we ambled home after a evening of food and beverage, we were approached on the street by a cheerful young man from Chile, who was looking for the Beatrice Inn. In his best English, he explained he was with also with a Brit and a Spaniard, and if they would have fun there. We told him yes, you probably would enjoy yourself. Then he asked what kind of music. Rock and roll mostly. Their faces lit up and after a hearty hand shake, they were on their way. How lucky we were to have met new friends. How lucky they were to happen to stop everyone's pal, DBTH.

Our friends. Our Little Birdys. And we promise that nothing will change. We just want to keep this party rolling along.So please, friends of DBTH, keep reading. Keep telling us what you think. Keep sending us tips, questions, ideas, invitations, Facebooks, myspaces, t-shirts, baby pictures, and anything else you can think of. We love it. We love it all. You always know where to find us. Happy Halloween and have a great weekend.Humbly,DBTHThanks to EatMyDesgin/Flickr for the amazing picture!

What: Surface Magazine & Marithe And Francois GirbaudWhere: Marithe And Francois Girbaud in SohoSurface Magazine put on a small affair last night for Marithe And Francois Girbaud at their store in Soho. The event was sponsored by Pommeray with art curated by Sebastian Angneesans for Construkt. While the store was gorgeous and the artwork on display was nice, this party was a shit show. Really. There was one door being used for entry and exit, both of which were difficult to achieve. There was no air conditioning. They were only serving small champagne poppers, which have to be opened individually. That is time consuming. Then they ran out of champagne. Did we mention it was really hot and really crowded? We did.We moved outside to Wooster Street, where a large crowd from inside had relocated to. Ah, fresh air! The party outside was much better than the party inside, which was fun, but also strange. We're sure this wasn't their intention. We stuck around for less than 20 minutes, and moved this party to better locales. But we're keeping that a secret.

A bit of news from around the globe. Nobu, arguably the world's most popular upscale sushi chain, is ready to spread its wings globally. A Little Birdy tells us to \"expect Dubai, Moscow and Mexico City. All are currently in the design or build out phase.\" Well, bully for Nobu. A few things to remember is that these are not all part of the New York's Myriad Group, but may instead be licensed franchises. This also reinforces that Nobu should no longer be considered an option for serious dining or drinking. It is simply a place for tourists and expense accounts, and that ain't us.

They are at it again. The folks from Tuthilltown, New York State's only operating distillery, have gone against the grain with their latest offering. Yo ho ho, a bottle of mofo Rum. That's right, rum is being made right here in New York State. Called Hudson River Rum, it is a rich, deep and imposing spirit distilled from heavy blackstrap molasses that leaves its mark on the nose and palate. Aged in American and European oak, it is infused with the smoky feel of a northeastern night by the campfire. The distillery recommends serving warm with a touch of cream to ward off the chill in winter.Mmmmm, that's tasty. By the way, this is an extremely limited batch, so we suggest you pick one up soon, or risk never getting a drop.

It's Monday, time for a Weekend Recap edition of Quick Hits. Did you feel that? We just hit you.1. More tales from Upstairs, no one's favorite exclusive club above Cafe Bari. A Little Birdy reports, \"My friends and I were walking past Upstairs at 2:30 Friday morning and decided to see what it is all about. We approached the bouncer, who asked what party we were with. I replied, 'we are the party', which set the bouncer off on some crazy rant about something or other. After going on for a few minutes, he offered to let us in if we agreed to buy a bottle - for $1600! We laughed at him and kept walking.\" Jesus Wayne! $1600 is by far the most expensive bottle of anything in NYC. And we know he was talking Absolut here. 2.We aren't afraid to pass along this report from Scoopy's Notebook in the Villager, saying \"that Mannahatta bar on the Bowery may be moving out soon and that the operator who hopefully will take over the space has a great record of running community-friendly establishments in the ’hood.\" That's bound to be an improvement. 3. A Little Birdy was at Beatrice Inn on Friday night, one night after being shut down, and seems to have had a bad time, reporting, \"the place was way overcrowded, very hot, and every guy in there was rocking skinny suspenders. Awful.\" To each his own, we guess.4. Finally, yours truly walked past the San Loco on Avenue A recently, and we are proud to report that they are serving booze once again. Viva San Loco! Viva El Guaco Loco!

On a warm Saturday night, with about 70 close friends and family members enjoying themselves both inside the store and out on Broome Street, Papabubble officially opened for business. Just two days late to boot. Not too shabby. The walls were fully stocked with fresh candy, open jars with samples were everywhere, and we had a choice of some bubbly and Tecate for our sipping pleasure. Chris and Fiona, your stateside Papabubble proprietors, even put on a little candy making show for us. Then we got more samples of fresh warm candy, which is pretty tough to beat. Our favorite? The oh so decadent Gold Ring, made by the Illuminator himself. You can ask for him by name when you stop by, which we expect each of you to do sometime very soon. Check out our Flickr page for some more great shots of the Papabubble Party!

As promised, we called in a nightlife and hospitality guru to Break Down the asking price for Rififi. Without further ado, Guru! \"Check my math, but $72/sf. Not a great deal. Danny Meyer's deal at Gramercy Tavern is $20. So is Batali's at Del Posto. Those are below market. Looking for top restaurant real estate now? $200/sf. $72 is okay, but not great deal for a bar. As far as the $300k key money, depends on what they are leaving in there. Should have no problem transferring the liquor license in that neighborhood. You could do some bargaining and a total face lift and get something open for less than half a million.\" We like a good bargain, but we love having fun more than hard work. This may not be the spot for us.

The Standard NYC has been a long time coming. But has the lag time caused Andre and the Gang to lose their way? A Little Birdy found a listing on the oh so secretive aSmallWorld network from the Standard folks that reads: We are opening a fantastic new project in NYC, The Standard New York will be anything but Standard. The question would be, what is it people/guests like to see at the hotel, what should be there and what should not be there. This is a question for the local NY'ers whom like to go out in the area and for future & existing guests. Our LB notes, \"Reeks of desperation: posting on aSmallWorld - surely, surely they must know what the hotel should & shouldn't be doing, without having to ask a load of trashy Euros, & i-bankers...\" Yeah, we agree. Msr. Balazs is a successful hotelier many times over, and with his Meatpacking baby so close to the finish line, an effort like this is a little disconcerting. We've got an idea for what should be there. An accessible hotel with courteous staff, comfortable beds, decent rates, and a few lounges open to anyone who may want to come by. It is a hotel, which nowadays seems easy to open, and difficult to get right.

You know if was fertile hunting grounds because Cuba Gooding Jr., was there. Anyway, I was expecting Richie to be doing something else when his new club is supposedly opening tomorrow night. I'm putting my money on December... if they're lucky.\" Don't knock Cuba like that. He is on his way back.

What: Hugo Boss Spring/SummerWhere: 25 BroadwayFashion week may be way over, but the fashion events never really end. That's good news for us, because the invitations keep rolling in. Last night, we headed to 25 Broadway at the very bottom of Manhattan to attend the Hugo Boss party for their Spring/Summer 2008 collection. Let's just say that the Boss went all out for this one, inviting 600 of their closest friends and colleagues to get down in the grand lobby of an old time New York City building. The weather was unseasonable warm, so we decided to stroll down to the party. Walking inside, we noticed 4 stations with laptops to manage the guest list. Technology has arrived. DBTH +2 and away we went. Highlights of the evening were numerous, but tops on our list was the Misshapes, making their triumphant return to the main stage from their book tour duties. They were there in force, playing the same songs they always play with little ability to actually mix two songs together. Ah, to be young and over marketed. Other highlights include the copious bottles of champagne, a raw bar, an abundance of high quality passed items, and the overall space, which was divided into the bar, eating and seating area, and dance floor. It was the Misshapes, so of course there was dancing. We hung around for a good long while, but we didn't close it out. Thanks for the fun time Hugo.

Could Rififi's days be numbered? Is the famous Friday night Trash party coming to an end? The answer, unfortunately, seems to be yes. A Little Birdy writes, \"Rififi's is closing! Their liquor license expires Oct 31 2007, they haven't applied for a renewal, and they just got hit with some heavy fines (30 grand?) and a license revocation by the SLA. The cops and the fire department busted them for all those crazy parties promoted by Shaw. And it's been on the market for at least six months here. Where are all the underaged NYU hipsters going to dance now?\" Why, they will just go to Lit of course. But this is still bad news. Everyone has had a list \"one of those nights\" at Rififi, and now it seems this year's freshman class will be the last. And that's sad.:( More on the listing later today.

From the horse's mouth.... RIFIFI is not closing. Every bar/club/lounge's liquor license expires every 2 years. The renewal process is simple and quick. No fines have been imposed as of yet on RIFIFI. Don't believe the hype! Also RIFIFI has a no tolerance policy on underage drinking. If you are underage please do not attempt to gain entry to RIFIFI, you will be denied. Please rethink the content of this post, it is inflammatory and has very little truth contained within!

You hear something once, and you brush it off as rumor. You hear something twice, and you start to believe a little bit more. Three times, well, that little piece of gossip is almost a fact. So here it goes.Our old friend Diddy was busted for fighting last weekend. Not very smooth. We don't care too much about the man's comings and goings, so we let the story go at that. But the story has taken an interesting turn. Every published report puts the event at Kiosk, a store at 95 Spring Street that apparently \"which hosts social events at night\". Uh, we don't think so. Then a Little Birdy reminded us that this is the same block as our old friend, Upstairs, the bar that has been described as \"small, intimate and PACKED with six-foot runway models.\" Now, we have been hearing from a few very reliable sources that Diddy was at Upstairs on Friday night/Saturday AM. The brawl went down both inside and outside the club, and according to a Little Birdy that is most definitely in the know, \"Danny A's trying to blame the bar down the street.\"Now that is something that does make sense. Your club's legality is still on shaky ground. A promoter who claims to work parties there is a major DB, and now a trouble making celeb gets arrested outside. This is all bad news for Danny A. But it's great news for us.Consider this one developing. But now you know why we were able to say, Upstairs is really ou'st.UPDATE: The Post piggy backs on what we already knew. Upstairs is one dangerous place.

Indian summer has just ended and the fall chill has just set itself down in Manhattan. Some people love the changing seasons, but not the Tenjune crew. No sir e bob. So what are good club owners and party promoters to do? Plan a party weekend in Puerto Rico of course. So while most of us are enjoying the City the weekend of November 2, Mark B., Eugene and the gang are headed down to the recently renovated El San Juan Hotel for a weekend of sun, sand and private partying. Puerto Rico! Don't forget about the promise of special guest performances and top level DJ's. We didn't. The best part is that you're all invited. Actually, only people who received email invitations are invited. But don't sweat, you can have your own little party right here. They have even taken the extra step of arranging travel packages for invitees from New York, LA, and Miami. Gee that was thoughtful. Just remember to bring a towel.. Tenjune El San Juan Weekend Party

Since we enjoyed the Brooklyn Blast so much, we decided to head back to the Beer Room to pick ourselves up another growler (or 3). Little did we know that there was a party going on inside. A beer party that is. The WF team welcomed Cooperstown's favorite son Ommegang Brewery inside to celebrate their 10th birthday. As a special treat, the Ommegang folks brought down a barrel or two of their brand new Chocolate Indulgence Stout, a limited edition fall/winter beer that was brewed in celebration of the 10 year milestone. The in-store sampling party was the first public tasting, and the Stout was a winner. Not for nothing, the WF team kicked in some crazy rich Beer-Cheddar soup and some frites with a cheddar-beer dipping sauce. Ho-lee!. Get your growler while the choco stout party is still going strong.

A sleepy little corner of the Upper East Village may get a little less sleepy if the folks behind Mr. Biggs get their way. We have heard that the sports bar, who's head quarters is in Hell's Kitchen, is attempting to open a second branch on the corner of 13th and Avenue A in the space formerly occupied by Nopal Del Este. Problem is the Mr. Biggs team has run into some stiff opposition from the neighbors and Community Board, who have little interest in having a maxed out sports bar that is known for its burgers and karaoke nights. While the old Alphabet City would have no interest in a Mr. Biggs type spot, times have definitely changed. Just ask the people who pack another uptown sports bar that opened up a few blocks away.Consider this one developing.

You live in a house or apartment, but you only stay in a hotel room for a few nights. Damn that's a quick visit. This is a hotel edition of Quick Hits. Do you have a tip or link that may rock our world? Our telefax is always plugged in.1. Stephen Starr, everyone's favorite Philly blowhard, is reaching into Freeman's Alley to bring a little Hell Square cachet to the Ill D. Starr has signed up Freeman's own Taavo Somer to help redesign his space at 706 Chestnut in Philly, which has been the home of a few previous Starr concepts that have bit the dust. Not only that, but Starr is planning to turn the rest of the property into a very intimate boutique hotel. Wonder where the Wonder Boy got that idea?2. The Kor Group, the LA based boutique powerhouse, is expanding the Viceroy Hotel brand way beyond the beach. After a lengthy and difficult battle, the company recently got approval for the Viceroy Snowmass. As in Aspen. As in boo yah.3. Our friends at Curbed don't believe there's any chance that Gild Hall can open its door by the end of this year. Oh yeah? Then why are they hiring?

Unsubstantiated rumor of the year, by way of a very special Little Birdy, who tells us, \"my boss has a wedding at the St. Regis in Orange County in two weeks. He tried to book a room at the hotel but every room is booked. Rumor is Lilo is having her 'get out of rehab' party there that weekend, and every room got snatched.\" Take it for what it's worth. It was too funny not to share. Officially, a Lilo get out of rehab blow fest has to be the worst conflicting event you could have the weekend of your wedding. No doubt.More to come later in the day. Stay tuned.

***CONTENT
Last night, we had the pleasure of attending the Urban Land Institutes's panel discussion on the current state of the hotel market. Why? Well, because we find it interesting. Especially when Ian Schrager's partner and right hand man, Michael Overington and the force behind the Dream Hotel, Jay Stein, are on the panel. While there wasn't much gossip, they had plenty to say about the New York City hotel industry. Below, a paraphrasing of what we heard.Michael Overington: At Ian Schrager, hotels are about giving the customer a personal experience. Their hotels have a soul, and design and service are their key to success. The company is currently looking for new opportunities in the City, but the insanely high prices [more on this below] has kept them from signing any deals. Neighborhoods under consideration: Hudson Yards, Lower Lower Manhattan, and somewhere in Brooklyn. Jay Stein: We have three star and four star properties. Our three star customers, we could really care less about. The three star guests don't matter. Our four star guests are the ones we like and need to keep as repeat customers. Repeat business is key. People don't want cookie cutter hotel rooms anymore. After many years of practice, we are ready to open big with the new Dream Hotel in the Meatpacking District. The cost of building was close to $1,000,000 a key.That kind of attitude about 3 star customers drives us crazy. If we pay, treat us right, and make sure we want to come back. How can you trust the same person to know how to treat you at a four star level if they don't know that every paying customer deserves high quality service? You can't. As for Schrager, we don't know if that service commitment means the same thing to us that it does to them. As for new properties, Ian and Co. have always searched for bargains in hotel properties, and they are always willing to go far from established neighborhoods knowing his name will bring customers. But at $1 mil a room, even he can't find a place to go. For now. Lenders are still willing to lend, and with that Marriott deal all locked up, you can be sure he won't be sitting out for long.

Time for an update from the Grand Street Hotel, the little glass number from Brack Capital. A little birdy checks in, saying \"this project is taking a turn for the weird, and seems that this will be an ego play for some over-zealous real estate dorks who decided they want their own hotel. I have also heard they are planning on installing a monster amount of led lights...this thing should be pretty tacky.\" Hmmm. Or it could just be super green, as LED's can be uber-efficient when used correctly. Either way, it's good to have some background on the place.BONUS UPDATE: Just for you, we perused Brack Capital's website, learning that the Grand Street Hotel will officially have 114 rooms, and the required restaurant, rooftop pool and bars. That's bars, plural.

It's Monday morning, the perfect time for Quick Hits. The hits are so quick, you probably didn't realize we've already hit you. Damn that's quick. Today's subject, what we drank this weekend. 1. We stopped by the Belcourt to see what's what at the French styled bistro on Second Avenue. Besides the food (which was good), we particularly enjoyed the Napoleon Rye, an all around classy drink made with Sazerac Rye, Napoleon Mandarine, and homemade orange bitters. It packs an orange punch, and went down very smoove.2. We made our way to the Whole Foods beer room to fill up a growler, and despite some so-so service from the resident experts, we walked away rather happy. The reason? The growler full of Brooklyn Blast, the first in a special brewmaster's line from Williamsburg finest. The Blast is a super hoppy beer that packs 8.2% alcohol. We suggest getting it before it's gone.

Last night, while the blog set was celebrating a book, we decided to celebrate art. It was a double fête for the opening of Pace Print's new gallery and their first artist, Ryan McGuiness. The party was held just a few doors down from the gallery, and surprise, there was no list. But there was a button. Aha! We pinned ours on and headed inside. The party was a casual affair, highlighted by the kegs of Stella and Sabrett hot dog carts spread throughout the hall. Classy? No. Effective? Hell yes. You don't need caviar and cocktails for a party to be fun. At least we don't. They even made a special button for us (seen above). It really made us feel welcome. And warm inside. Awww.Anyway, we hear that Ryan's work was a smashing success. Everything on display was sold . We can also tell you the party was a smash, because when we left, we were.Don't forget to check our Flickr box for more pictures from the event!

Wolfgang Zwiener seems to have this whole steakhouse thing figured out. 1. Serve as head waiter at New York City's dominant steakhouse for decades.2. Partner up with your sons and a few coworkers to open your own joint.3. Get a killer review.4. Open multiple locations. Mission accomplished. But that doesn't mean the Wolfgang's crew is going to rest on its laurels. Two locations? Not enough. Manhattan? Can't contain them. So what's the next step? LaLa land baby. DBTH has learned that Wolfgang's is bringing its show to the West coast, with plans to open a third location on Canon Drive, smack dab in the middle of the Hills. Beverly that is. Ohhhhh! Target opening is late 2008, and the folks at the Palm, Mastros and Wolfgang Puck should take note. The dry aged porterhouse for two doesn't play around.

We haven't been to the Cove, and the opportunity to see Maroon 5 in a warm setting isn't enough to get us on a plane. We stood next to Adam Levine at a concert once. That's plenty.

Jason Pomeranc is one busy birdy. Everyone has been waiting with baited breath for the long delayed Six Columbus to finally open and for the Thompson Lower East Side to wrap up construction sometime in 2008. In doing so, they have let their next hotel project slip right past them. But we can tell you all about it of course. This new one is downtown, and it's called Gild Hall. Located at 15 Gold Street in the Financial District, Jason P. and the crew have taken what is/was a Holiday Inn and are in the process of giving it the full Thompson. According to the website, Gild Hall will be ready for a soft open this winter. But according to us, it will probably a little bit later than that. More details to follow of course.

Fergus Henderson, the chef that taught us about eating The Whole Beast, is back at it. The head chef of St. John in London has written a new book, Beyond Nose to Tail . . . , and to celebrate its release, Henderson is having himself a little book party at The Spotted Pig. If you're expecting passed hors d'oeuvres and frilly drinks, think again. A Little Birdy tells us, \"Fergus is having his book party at the Spotted Pig on October 10. The night will have him as the head chef of the Spotted Pig, cooking up whatever types of animals he can find at the butcher that day. Not only that, April B will be his line cook for the night.\" Hmmm. \"Whatever kind of meat\" is a dangerous thing with this guy Fergus. Ox heart? Pig tails? Most def. The man has and will cook almost anything. We suggest making your reservations now if you want to enjoy this once in a blue moon event. If they took reservations.UPDATE: Like some other people we know, our Monday morning reading comprehension is a bit off. Fortunately, ours was a simple mistake and not a sign of plain stupidity. Fergus's book party is 10/8 at the Spotted Pig. He will be cooking at the Pig on 10/8. DBTH apologizes for the mistake.

Break Down: Upstairs Bar Part II

***CONTENT
We already Broke Down where Upstairs is. Now, based on a little note we received, we will breakdown why you go there and just how to get in. Let's begin. Why You Go:1. To AVOID commoners.2. This club is for the elite. IF this is you, then GO.3. The club is small, intimate and PACKED with six-foot runway models.Those are all great reasons on why to pick Upstairs as your drinking establishment of choice. We hate commoners. But we love you. Now, to the second and more important breakdown.How You Get In:1. Call the doorman Wayne. He is black and really cool. 2. Call Wayne at 11:30 and tell him you are Danny A's friend. 3. Tell him you met Danny -A- at a model party a few weeks ago.4. Don't get a table.5. Go at exactly 12:30 and you better be dressed HOT and COOL.6. If you are a guy you MUST have at least one tall woman with you OR YOU WILL NOT GET IN. Two women are better. Two or more men together WILL NEVER GET IN.7. You should ONLY go as a couple the first time you go.8. Go in, have few drinks, and then come down later and hang out a bit and get to know Wayne the doorman.9. Give Wayne $20 at some point. Lordie. That's a lot of rules. And it seems like an awful lot of lies to tell just to get in to a bar. We hate liars. How about this? You open a bar, check ID's, play good music and serve good drinks at a reasonable price. Then, and only then, we will think about coming by to hang out and spend money.

Not to beat a dead horse, but is there anything lamer than a secret club trying to get more customers by hiring promoters to promote the club's secretness. Answer: No. Another email begging us to come to Upstairs came in, and this thing is truly next level. If you don't know who Danny -A- is or don't want to Google HIM do not try to get into this club. I was there last night and he was blowing out losers and short people. We were hanging out with Leonardio DiCaprio, Mark Wahlberg, Shakira and a room full of runway models. This is where these people go to AVOID commoners.It is a PRIVATE club. It is above Cafe Bari on the corner of Spring and Broadway. The doorman is a stocky, really cool black guy named Wayne. His PERSONAL phone number is 646-515-^&*(removed). Call him at 11:30 and tell him Danny -A- gave you his number and you are going to stop by in a little while. If he asks, and he probaly won't, tell him you met Dannay -A- at a model party a few weeks ago. If he asks if you want a table SAY NO, that you are just stopping by. The club opens at midnight. To get in go at exactly 12:30 and you better be dressed HOT and COOL. If you are a guy you MUST have at least one tall woman with you OR YOU WILL NOT GET IN. Two women are better. Two or more men together WILL NEVER GET IN.You should ONLY go as a couple the first time you go. Go in, have few drinks, and then come down later and hang out a bit and get to know Wayne the doorman. A $20 tip will help him remember you. He is really cool and KNOWS EVERYONE he lets in. This club is for the elite. IF this is you, then GO.The club is small, intimate and PACKED with six-foot runway models. If you want to whine and say sour grapes and that this is not for you, fine DON'T GO. Otherwise, to continue to get the passwords for the two other SUPER HOT new NY clubs, send us a report AFTER you get in to Cafe Bari. Once you go to Cafe Bari and give us a report, we will send you the info for the other two new super hot clubs in town.Oh man. Someone really wrote this? A human being? This is just too much for us to handle. We have hired 3 interns to parse through all the details. But now we know, Upstairs is really, really ous't.

Possibly the worst thing I have heard since I returned from Iraq, its this kind of douche bag/self aggradizing/class-less BS that has turned NYC from a once great American city into a den of horrible young 20 and 30 somethings that spend their weekends playing at one ups-manship and sycophantic maneuvering. The people involved in the promotion of this club should be ashamed of themselves, but in this town there is not a chance of that.-An old Marine

David Bowie was at Upstairs tonight. Omg. It was ridiculous. I of course spoke to him over some space wine, and this is what he told me:I too have beaten a dead horse once - it was as pained as this discussion thread. \" Down by the Dumpster\" \"More like it\". Get it? RIGHT RIGHT RIGHT? Little fat man///I wonder what it's like in WAYNE'S WORLD? He does, afterall, have a 6-4-6 area code? I wonder where he works out...If you should only go as a couple the first time you go, do you thereafter go as a few? Or just rock it solo? So may questions, so few answers...can always trust the Little Birdys!

The Standard in New York City still isn't ready, but Andre Balazs’ hasn't put the rest of his expansion plans on hold. The next location? Central America baby. To be more exact, Costa Rica. Sir Andre will probably look to apply some of the spa-rific lessons he learned with the Standard Miami in this new venture, even though Costa Rica is so over. Very lovely, but over. You would expect the first international Standard to be somewhere a bit more exotic, but this is the safe play. Or the Standard play, as it were.

Time for a brand new feature here at DBTH: Ins't or Ous't, where we tackle the state of New York City nightlife establishments and decide whether they are worth your time. Get it? Got it.Place: UpstairsNeighborhood: SohoStatus: Ous'tIt was just a few months ago that Upstairs burst onto the scene, wowing the hipserati with is semi secret location (above Cafe Bari), A-level promoter and over-abundance of curtains. Shockingly, no one really cared. And if you thought it was over before it got started, we are ready to confirm it. You know why? We recently got hit with this email:Okay, so www.Gawker.com outed the new -A- list only hot new Soho hot spot, now we have the inside info for you... Danny A , New York's hottest promoter has opened a small private club and now you can get in. Last week Shakira, Leonardo DiCaprio and Mark Wahlberg hung out here. Just send send an email request to [super awesome party list] and we'll give you the address and the secret password to get in....Compliments of The Balsin. We actually hurt our finger trying to respond to this offer. Thanks www.Gawker.com for letting the public in on this secret. In less than 2 months, Upstairs has gone from a secret club for celebs and insiders to being open to bloggers and anyone else with an email address, complete with the tease that we may just get to see Leo et al. Egggh. Just like that, Upstairs is officially ous't.

***CONTENT
Royale on Avenue C had so much going for it. Outstanding burgers. An outstanding backyard in which to enjoy those burgers. Acceptable juke box. And most importantly, $3 cans of Butternuts , specifically Pork Slap Pale Ale, a super malty beverage brewed in upstate New York. Butternuts is one of the few beer makers to use the can these days, and we salute them for it. It is a clean taste, not too thin and not overpowering, despite the heavy malt, and at $3, you knew you were getting value. Until now. A recent trip to Royale revealed a price increase to $4! When asked, a bartender replied \"we should have done it a long time ago.\" Is that so. $3 is the perfect price for a can of beer, about $1.50 over the distributor's price and not so much that you would question your choice. But $4, now that is a head scratcher and enough to have us looking at the menu for a beer pulled from the tap. Consider this developing.

What: Unforgivable WomanWhere: A private townhouse on West 67th streetUnfortunately, we can't be everywhere. Last night was one of those times where a conflict kept us away from an event. Luckily, we had a Little Birdy to pick up the slack. Attending the P. Diddy/Sean John event for his woman's line, Unforgivable Woman, our LB filed this breathless report. Packed 3 story townhouse on west 67th street. Line down the block to get in. Serious door and cops. Videos of the UW ad playing around the house. Full-on red carpet with many media. The venerable Aretha Franklin was addling down the stairs as I got there. Saw Fabian Basabe and beard wife. Jay Z and Beyonce graciously took pictures with fans on the way out. Ashton Kutcher walked in with small entourage and tried to find the elevator so he didn't have to push through all the people. Zac Posen and several groupies made their way out while criticizing outfits. Puffy and entourage eventually made it to Marquee which was bumping when I left. Nice work LB. Sounds like you had a grand old time. We love how you slipped in the Marquee afterparty as well. That's how you roll. Take note haters: The Puffy One can still throw it down. Indeed.

Time for a very special restaurant edition of everyone's favorite, Quick Hits. If you have ever wanted to hit something quickly, please do let us know.1. La Esquina may be open once again, but that doesn't mean you can get in. A Little Birdy writes, \"What's the deal with La Esquina? I called at 10:00 AM the day you announced they reopened, and I can only get tables at 6 or 11:30. It doesn't matter what size my party is, or the day of the week. They only have 6 or 11:30. Ridiculous.\" That is ridiculous Birdy. Stop saving tables for your VIP list and let anyone book a table.2. As our friends at Eater point out, Daniel Boulud is planning on bringing his oh so famous uptown hamburger to his new downtown spot, DBowery. When it opens of course. But friends, countryment, Birdies, please do not overlook the hot dog. You know why? A Little Birdy tells us, \"Boulud is planning on reinventing the hot dog in the same way he reinvented the hamburger at DB Bistro. It's going to be over the top luxurious.\" Luxurious hot dog, that's crazy. 3. Finally, a quick word of good luck to one of our favorite chefs, April Bloomfield of the Spotted Pig, who is stepping into the battle zone known as Kitchen Stadium this morning to battle the Iron Chefs. We would think she would be a natural against Batali, but he is gone so who knows? A burger and those pasta things that are made out of 100% cheese should do the trick, no matter what the secret ingredient is.

Hypothetical. You own and operate the most successful restaurant and nightclub in the United States. Your New York City flagship is wildly popular with expense accounters and celebs. Your brand has broken through to become a hospitality institution. What is left for your to do? Head to Miami of course. That's what the folks at Tao are planning to do. According to a Little Birdy in the know, \"they have signed a lease for a space on Lincoln Rd. off Washington somewhere. No timing yet, sounds like its going to take a while.\" South Beach get up! We asked our Miami Seagull, who isn't too surprised, saying, \"big, open space that has been vacant for years. It was kiss steakhouse, which was 'owned' by Janet Jackson.\" And we all know how that worked out. Or maybe we all don't. No matter, sometime next year we will all be able to enjoy swordfish skewers by the beach. Delicious.

What: Hard Rock Hotel Hits New YorkWhere: Stereo, West 29th Street - ChelseaThe good folks from the Hard Rock Hotel in Vegas brought their show to New York, hoping to say hello to their New York high rollers and maybe pull in a few new ones. We decided to check it out. Uh, mistake. May we suggest not walking in to Stereo while the sun is still shining. Thank you. On the plus side, the drinks were free. The negatives? Just about everything else. The crowd was 100% suits, mixed with 10 female casino hosts imported for the affair. Thus, said suits spent tried their best to woo the out of towners. (Evidence above) The success rate seemed to be pretty darn low. The drinks came in the Stereo's customary plastic glass, and they were passing around some sort of apps. But really, who is eating anything out of that kitchen? Not us. When having a party, it is pretty hard to achieve negative authenticity, a setting so contrived it reeks of contrivity. We have to hand it to them, because they did in fact achieve it. After 30 minutes, we had seen enough. We bid adieu to our group and moseyed on out of there. You really can't win them all.Don't forget to check our Flickr page, full of fresh intelligence.

Dulces. Or as the sign says, Tienda de Caramelos, Artesanos. That's candy to you and I. And we ain't talking Bolivia. This time we are talking gourmet candy, hand made by some real candy experts. We're talking Papabubble. The Barcelona treat has settled on a location on Broome St, just east of the San Gennaro. The storefront is still papered over because some modern day Oompa's are hard at work getting this place ready for a late October opening. Hopefully. Because we all love candy. And we all love you.

Quick Hits: Vital Talent, Daniel Boulud Update

Monday morning Quick Hits? Why not?1. Chaotica and TCA, two music agencies with all-star DJ clients, have merged to form a DJ mega-agency, Vital Talent. That leaves AM Only as the only other agency with a comparable roster. If you want to throw a serious dance party, you are going to probably wind up calling one of them. 2.Master chef Daniel Boulud is bringing his fancy act to the Bowery, joining a few other fancy fellows. Very nice. According to a Little Birdy, the working name (but not 100% official) for his new space is DBowery. And according to DBTH, the food will probably be very expensive.

We recently paid a visit to Hill Country. Very smart move. But we aren't here to discuss the food. Others much more experienced than us have already done that. No, today we are here to discuss cocktails. Hill Country has them, and they are pretty special. And that's what makes Hill Country very special. On top of the kick ass cue, they went the extra mile and pulled together a kick ass drink menu, featuring Tito's vodka (from Texas, where else), bourbon and tequila based drinks that are interesting and tasty. And at no more than $10 a pop, not wallet busting either. All of this without mentioning the expansive bourbon, whiskey and tequila selection, Lone Star beer and ice tea in a mason jar, live music in the basement bar etc etc. You begin to get it. Hill Country is good.

Soho. Once the mecca of downtown cool is now more of a quaint outdoor mall with some nice restaurants and very nice housing. We're fine with that. But what about that weird flea market on the corner of Howard and Broadway, just one block north of Canal? It's one of the few blocks that actually dead ends, with Howard being halted by Mercer to the West. Call us crazy, but it seems weird that this prime corner lot, surrounded by all that valuable property, would be used as a low end flea market. Well apparently, the owner of this lot agrees. The flea market's days are pretty much numbered, with the owner planning to build a hotel on the lot. A luxury hotel to boot. What else would you expect? Said owner/developer is in discussions with some heavy hitters about the restaurant and bar space, but no deals are in place. What's more, the adjacent buildings are either vacant or severely underutilized, meaning that we could be looking at much more than just a little boutique number.

What is the new cocktail trend that is sweeping through Manhattan's finest cocktail establishments? Tonic water. Yeah, we know that tonic has always been around, but (relatively) new to the market is Q Tonic. Made from Peruvian quinine and sweetened with organic agave, Q is quickly becoming the go to tonic for the City's top bartenders. The product got some early buzz when it was introduced last fall, but it only recently has broken into the market. Example, Freeman's has just begun using it in it's tonic based drinks. Sweet. In fact, naturally sweet. After tasting it ourselves, we find it to be much improved over the traditional Schweppes tonic. The unnatural aftertaste is gone and the flavor blends nicely with a high quality gin. But it is still tonic. It doesn't really jibe with what we like to drink. DBTH will never shill for anyone. EVER. When we find a product worth mentioning, we feel a duty to share and share alike. If there are any questions regarding this policy, please feel free to let us know.

A few issues with the City haven't stopped Simon Hammerstein from conducting his bidness. A Little Birdy on the other side of the pond dropped this British Bombshell, saying , \"Simon Hammerstein is in London taking meetings with local nightlife heavies. He is there scoping out places for the Box.\" Taking the vaudeville act international. Now that is some bold thinking. It's tough to know how the Brits will react, but judging from the international contingent that frequents the Box's NYC location, we think it may be a big hit.

Like we said, summer is over. It's fall. That means football. And sometimes that means headed to a bar to catch all the action. You know we like bars. We also enjoy football. So we joined some friends who had made a reservation at Bounce Deuce in the East Village to enjoy a day of NFL action. We showed up for the early games and this is what we observed.Pros1. Every game in HD - nuff said.2. Above average food - especially for a sports bar in the City, they took it to a higher level. Let's not go crazy now. It wasn't next level, but still pretty good.3. Super tall 3 foot beer keg things - A nice touch. You could order beer once and not need the waitress for at least 25 minutes. Which as we will explain, comes in handy.4. Reservations - A nice touch, especially since this place was jammed from wall to wall. Cons1. Noise - This place was beyond loud. The volume for the main game was pumping through the place at level 11. You had to scream at the waitress to order.2. Service - Not the best. Expectations are never high for a sports bar on a busy Sunday, but this certainly didn't meet the minimum requirements. Misplaced food, slow delivery and a bit too much confusion for the staff. 3. Temperature - Uh, it's still 90 degrees outside. Where was the AC? Requests to turn it on went unfounded.Overall, the negatives outweighed the positives. Despite the rowdy crowd having fun, the heat and the noise made it hard to interact with our table. Alas, we have 16 more weeks to get it right. Photo Courtesy of Peddler of Bombast/Flickr.

Wrapping up the week with another killer edition of Quick Hits. Got a hit? Feel free to hit us.1.Speaking of the VMA's, we just got our invite to 50 Cents Vitamin Water, Absolut Vodka VMA party in Vegas. If we had any clue how to work this thing, you would be seeing video of the flipping. We try. UPDATE: We took it Lo-Fi, you can see still motion capture of all of the invite goodness. We are so handy.2. More adventures in How to Name a Hotel. A Little Birdy checks in with an update from the new glass number going up on Thompson Street, saying, \"the hotel in Soho from Brack Capital is going to be called the Grand Street Hotel. $200 million budget, 200 rooms.\" At least the guests won't get lost when they tell the cabbies where to drop them off. 3. Not tired of Fashion Week yet? Tonight is the big Prada party at their flagship store in Soho, and we hear that oh so super cool and oh so can you please play our Fashion Week party band LCD Soundsystem will be performing. Have fun kiddies.

Ok Ok. We know it's Diddy. We know it's coming way way late. We know everyone including the Today show has talked about this. We know. But when a Little Birdy sent us this shot from the White Party, we decided to let it fly. Look at those 3! Get them a TV show or a record deal or something. Our Little Birdy says, \"Even though everyone likes to rip on Diddy and the White Party, we had a blast. Great food and drinks, some good looking people, and the production quality for the event was through the roof.\" So it's a few years past it's prime. Like Tyra says, so what? If people are having fun, who are we to judge?

The abrupt closings of The Box and La Esquina's downstairs took everyone by surprise. But hey, these things happen. And last week, we told you that the Box reopened, which is good for someone. Still, there has been little news on La Esquina, the place to see and be seen if you can get in. Well, a Little Birdy just told us, \"they are still saying they are closed due to a water main problem. You can't even make a reservation for next month. But the women who I spoke with said they should know on Monday when they can reopen and if they can start booking tables.\" Sounds serial. Super serial. Even though we love it down there, it has to be some kind of crazy fire hazard if something were to go wrong. Crazier things have happened. We are guessing it may be a bit longer before they reopen.

The next week is a non-stop bonanza of activities here in NYC. But don't forget about that old New York event, the VMA's, which shifted to Vegas this year. What's the impact? According to one Little Birdy, pretty large. What say you, fluffy birdy?With all the hype surrounding fashion week, I am going to go out on a limb and predict that this will be one of the dullest fashion weeks in recent memory. The primary reason being that this weekend is the vma's in vegas. Not only is mtv taking over the entire palms resort (both towers), but there will be off the hook parties at every bar, restaurant and nightclub in Sin City. I am also predicting that all the celebs that make fashion week oh so fabulous will be in Vegas and not NYC.Bold Little Birdy. Very bold. But you do make a strong case. MTV lives or dies by its celeb wrangling (which is a whole other story), and the VMA's is their most important event. And it is Vegas. Add to that the lack of new club openings in the City, and you may just be right. As always, your thoughts are welcome in comments and squawk box.

What: W Magazine Fashion Week 2007Where: Chelsea Arts Center Strolling up to the still under construction Chelsea Arts Center showed a large crowd trying to negotiate with the clipboard cabaret. You know how this goes. DBTH, right this way. Of course. We walk into the lobby and pop into the elevator. It's up to the 19th Floor, PH level, and the door opens onto the party. It's on. Beautiful types and those that work with them were everywhere. You could even say the place was over-flowin. No matter. We grab a specialty cocktail that wasn't that special and head out to the terrace. Views of the Hudson and Lower Manhattan twinkled our eyes, as celebrity DJ Steve Aoki dropped a low key corporate mix. It still sounded good. As the event wore down, some starlets started showing up. We hear it was Jess Jess and Bon Bon. Don't forget the Calvin designers and the myspacers, the people that really make the week move. But alas, these things can't go on forever. Most of the time, that's a good thing. It was back down the elevator, grab the gift bag and head off into the night. Thanks W magazine. Good job.Don't forget to check our recently updated Flickr box for more shots.

What: Animal Collective Listening Party.Where: K&M Bar, North 8th Street, WilliamsburgJust because it's Fashion Week doesn't mean there is nothing else happening in the City. The night before departing for a fall tour of the U.S., Avey, Panda, Deacon and the Geologist made their way to K&M Bar in Williamsburg for a listening party for Animal Collective's upcoming album, Strawberry Jam. When we arrived, the bar was loosely filled with patrons enjoying the $2 beer and shot special. Choice. But at promptly 10:00, the DJ hit go and the first notes of Peacebone screamed out. Like bees to honey, the bar suddenly was overflowing, with heads moving to the first official playing of one of the most anticipated albums of the fall. The reaction, judged by the heads that were bouncing, was overwhelmingly positive.After the last notes of Derek, the crowd gave an enthusiastic cheer. We joined in. The DJ then struck up the next track and the party continued. At a dollar a drink, can you really blame it? We said our goodbyes and slid out the front, knowing another party loomed on the horizon.

Thought you could pull a fast one on us, Little Birdy? Thought we wouldn't find out? Guess what? We know. We know everything. Here's how. After reading last week's post on the new restaurant by the folks from the Spotted Pig, a Big Birdy clarified a few things, saying \"The seafood version of the Spotted Pig is not going to be ready until Spring of 2008. It's name is also the John Dory, not the 10 Spot.\" Well, that takes care of that. But waiting for Spring 2008? We want it to open now! And for you LB, if we ever see your beak around here, we'll make sure you never sing again.

Fashion Week 2007 has arrived. We are so excited we barely slept. But alas, we may have some bad news. It appears that not everyone is as ready for The Week as us. Remember we told you about 1 Oak, short for One of a Kind, a few months ago. We know Page Six remembers. Well, a Little Birdy says, \"1OAK is going to miss all of fashion week, which is a very big deal and will affect their opening. One of the parties they lost was a huge Justin Timberlake party.\" Oopsie. That's no good. Anyway, Superfriends Richie Akiva, Scott Sartiano, Jeffrey Jah and Ronnie Madra's new club just won't be ready in time, meaning you JT fans will just have to settle for watching his HBO special a few more times.

September 1. Summer is done-zo. We believe that we have done it dirty. You know this. And dare we say, this is the summer that New York City became a place to stay. Crazy stuff, but it's true. From river to river, the City was packed every weekend with more than European tourists and their foreign language Lonely Planets. 2007 is the summer when everyone decided that staying here when everyone else left was a good thing. We couldn't agree more.Now we move on to fall. Lordy, it's going to be a big one. We can promise you that.. We ramped up the intensity. . You know we do it with love.. It's time to bring the heat. So as you pack up those share houses and bring your sweaters back from storage, please don't forget about your old friend DBTH. We promise more Little Birdy's, more original content, more features and more of just about everything. Because if we don't give it to you, no one else will.Hope you had a great summer, and here's wishing you a great fall.Humbly,DBTHPhoto courtesy of VTShep1/Flickr

There was quite the hullabaloo this past weekends at the Box. Good news! It looks like that is all over. A flock of Little Birdys filed a version of the same report, saying \"was at the Box last night. It was a party to celebrate Virgin America's new LAX to JFK flight, complete with Sir Richard Branson, Thievery Corporation and Diplo. It was very corporate, everyone got these giant gift bags filled with travel goodies. Now I can say I have been in the same room as a billionaire.\" You sure can. Unfortunately, we can't. But, the Box is open, once again giving New York's resident ballers the chance to drop up $800 on a bottle for the honor of seeing an honest to goodness police raid. Where do we sign up?

Some more bad news for Kiki and Uniq and their Meatpacking District haunt PM. After first learning about a run in with the local community board, our Little Birdy come in with an update, and it's not good. I just heard that the full board of Community Board 2 voted to reject PM's application to renew their liquor license. Community members have sent a ton of letters to the State Liquor Authority demanding that they deny the renewal. They've got State Senator Tom Duane on board as well. The SLA should issue a decision within a week but it doesn't look good for PM. I also heard that PM is being sued by their landlord for back rent of over $500k -- that's a lot of bottle service to make up!!!That is a lot of bottle service Birdy. We don't know how CB's pick one place over another to make a point like this. Maybe we never will. At least you will be able to find K & U at their new place if PM goes to sleep.

Without further ado, Little Birdy! \"Soft opening (investors, friends, family) happened this evening (of august the 28th).\" Thanks LB, and please, do tell us how the drinks taste soon.

Gotta say--amazing. Room/ downstairs lounge nicely done, but unfinished- should have had that together. 19th c. industrial thing going on. Raised dining room is pretty, full glass front gives it nice feel. Sam Mason is in fine form. Maybe just for friends/fam but menu: 5 Savory/5 Sweet. VERY small dishes but VERY satisfying. Like wd, thought provoking- not meat+potatoes. Savory was terrific but sweet is where Mason (obviously) shines. Drinks were a highpoint. Mason hired the right guy- Eben Freeman does it right. Small list of 5 drinks. Red bell pepper punch was out of this world. A bubblegum vodka drink: didnt think I would, but loved it. Smart drink actually. After all the hype/delays, for sure figured it would be anticlimactic. But Mason&Co have got the goods.

So my wife and I checked in on the new place that we heard was a dessert spot in SoHo, a block from where we live.Through the frosted glass we could see that the lights were on and people were inside.We had also heard there would be some kind of soft opening before the weekend.So we walked in the unlocked front door.Fair enough?A guy who presented himself as an owner barked at us that they were not open.Then we asked if there would, in fact, be some kind of preview when he jumped out of his seat still barking \"No!\" and ushered us to the door with one or two more condescending statements and a crud-eating grin.My wife and I were dressed for dinner at a nice local place and we were as friendly as could be until this guy showered us with disgust.If he gives us any indication as to what patrons can expect, they won't be around very long at all.As for us? We're done. I don't care what they're serving.

JE is from the Shaolin and is a New York City boy at heart, but you better say hi soon, because his empire will be expanding to other U.S. cities and then Europe. Bonanza! Nice to meet you JE.

The owners of everyone's favorite gastropub The Spotted Pig are currently hard at work on opening their second location in the West Village. Well sourced rumors have it as seafood focused. Who are we to argue? Obviously no one. Heh. But when oh when will the Spotted Fish be ready to open? A little birdy sings, \"Was at the Pig over the weekend and heard some of the staff gossiping over some recent turnover there and if anyone could pick up shifts when the new 'Ten Spot' opens. Another person in their group asked what was the date, and bartender said October 1st. I guess they are calling it the Ten Spot.\" Hmmm, the 10 Spot on 10th Avenue opening on the first day of the 10th month. It's got a nice ring to it, no? Let's just hope they don't charge 10 bucks for a pint of beer. They are dangerously close already.

We are glad to say our commenter appears wrong. Sam Mason's Tailor is poised to open on August 30, and the town is aflitter. Strange little notes keep flying coming in about the place, like one from a Little Birdy saying, \"Fran Derby has recently rigged the kitchen of Tailor with a top-of-the-line surround sound speaker system and ipod connection so everyone will be on the same page during service. Ballin'!\" If you say so. What's \"ballin'!\" to us is this rumor we are hearing from the cocktail menu. Beyond infused whiskey's, it seems Sammy has plans to serve a desconstructed margarita, breaking each of the ingredients down to highlight each of their flavors. Sounds fun. We like ours on the rocks with a lot of salt.

The folks at WSA sat down with the NY Times to reveal their plans for the second Gansevoort property in New York City. We wonder where C.J. Hughes found the inspiration for the story? Interesting tidbits are few and far between. Prime One Twelve has decided to dip their toes into Manhattan's over-crowded steakhouse waters, thinking they can bring some Miami sizzle to the City. Remember 112, City folk like their bacon thick and tasty. Here's what's most interesting: Gansevoort Park’s top three floors, open to the public, will cover 8,000 square feet. They will include bars, decks and a pool, though the exact configuration is being kept secret, Mr. Achenbaum said, to prevent a competitor from trying to install a similar feature before the hotel is finished in the spring of 2009.Oooh, a secret. Good plan Achenbaum. How many developers in this city are hoping to get a peek at your top secret roof plans? Could it be a roof pool with a bar? A roof bar with a pool? Maybe it's a lazy river ride with multiple bars. Now that would really be something.

Say you live in a dingy downtown studio. A medical problem arises that requires a minor operation. Where's a person to go convalesce? Our Little Birdy with a busted wing chose the Bowery Hotel. So what was the best part? Little Birdy says:The movies. Dead serious. I was bedridden for four days with a bottle of percocet and shit to do, and they came correct on the selection of dvd's, organized by genre, director, and year. among them: 400 Blows, Jules and Jim, Seven Samurai, Manhattan, Annie Hall, Dog Day Afternoon (we went through the \"New York Stories\" section pretty quickly), The Producers (the original), Grey Gardens, etc. Literally: every movie I would have in my dream collection, they had on file and brought up about two minutes after I asked for it. Again: solid.Like a rock. Apparently the room service from the hotel and Gemma are on point as well, arriving fast and hot. Sounds pretty good to us. Glad to know your feeling better too. Sounds like LB will be back flying in no time.

After years of litigation, the little known Belvedere Winery had finally slayed the big bad Belvedere vodka. A judge had ruled that LVMH's clear, tasteless liquor had infringed upon the winery's precious trademark, and LVMH's had little choice but to change Belvedere's name and move on. LVMH chose White Star. They planned a big ol' marketing blitz to introduce the new product. And then nothing ever happened. So what went down? A Little Birdy, who doesn't much like singing in the rain, sang this us, \"LVMH resolved the Belverdere issue with the California winery, buying the name outright. New Belvedere marketing campaign will hit full force in Sept.\" Resolved to us means they drove up to Napa with a big ass bag of cash and dropped it on someone's door. TCB, you know? At least our banker friends won't be confused when they get their bottle bills at Tenjune and see a $450 charge for something called White Star. Now we can all get some sleep.

***CONTENT
So the Mormons of Marriott have come knocking on Ian Schrager's door with the hopes of bringing the boutique hotel to the masses. Good for them. But is it good for the masses? The oh so boutiquey Gansevoort's expansion plan incensed a boutique hotel operator we know, who flittered off a note about the use of 'boutique' when it comes to these impostors hotels, especially Schrager's. This hotel guru says: A boutique by definition is a shop or a firm that is small and specialized. The hotels I have owned and/or operated are independently owned and adhere to traditional hospitality principles of customer service and satisfaction. The hotel is the thrust of the business. That is a boutique hotel. Hotels such as this have been operating in Europe for over 150 years and this is the legacy that I aspire to be associated with, because it is these hotels that 150 years later are still in business. Schrager takes credit for coining the term “Boutique Hotel” but he also deserves the credit for bastardizing the term. His biggest offense being the Hudson. 500 rooms, high design and poor service and he was marketing the hell out of the thing as a boutique hotel because it was trendy. Schrager applied this formula well when he created Morgans Hotel, the first boutique hotel he would have you believe, and he proceeded to roll out hotels that got further and further away from those traditional principles. If there is one thing I will say about Schrager is he is an absolute genius in the PR and Marketing arena, his ability to get out his message is second to none and people buy what he sells.A little rambly but we couldn't agree more. Give Ian credit for creating a modern option when it comes to urban travel. But let's not make it seem like he had invented the wheel. It should also be noted that service and comfort are barely mentioned. To us, that is rule #1. If we don't get a great night sleep and over the top help from the help, why should we care about the note pads on the desk? As always, your thoughts are welcome in the comments or via airmail.

Some fun Friday tidbits that we wanted to share with our first ever edition of Quick Hits.1. Following up on the roof party at the Bowery, a commenter notes, \"Now if only the staff at the Bowery would lose the pathetic attitude. The hostess at Gemma is only out done by the Einstein managing Bowery's outdoor patio.\" A little rough, but we know the feeling. Ordering a drink inside that hotel is a guaranteed adventure. And still no music. 2. A Little Birdy files a report from the recently rejiggered Candy Cafe, saying, \"My girlfriend arranged to host a little early evening birthday celebration for me at the Candy Cafe. We had about 18 people for wine and small plates before we went out for the night. It worked out great.\" Glad to hear it, and sorry we weren't able to attend. We love birthdays.3. Sam Mason's plan to craft brown butter whiskey sure sounds sweet to us, but are we ever going to get a chance to try it? A commenter throws some doubt on the fire, saying, \"Inside contractor sites serious financial problems due to time overruns. Place may never open unless stable backer steps to the fore.\"

Of course he needs more cash...guess he didn't think forward enough beyond his uber-hipster persona to include someone with both deep enough pockets and enough experience to craft a solid business plan, and thought his boy genius would carry him to the top of the NYC restaurant scene. NOTE TO MASON: that's why Wily had Vongerichten and Phil Suarez in his corner when he opened wd-50. Get a life, you hipster douche-bag! Maybe next time you won't spend a fortune on advance PR and waste big bucks splashing your hideous mug and oh-so-cool full sleeve all over the internet before you have the expenses for your actual physical plant covered...it's all about COOKING and THE FOOD and most decidely NOT your HIPSTER DOUCHE-BAG IMAGE, douche-bag! Have fun paying off all your creditors and going to work for someone else again.

Funkjester, perhaps you should be careful who you call a douchebag, because I'm detecting an odor of vinegar and roses coming from your direction, not Sam's.You have absolutely no insight into what's really going on behind the scenes over at Tailor. My advice to you is that you shut the fuck up and perhaps reread the quote in your \"About Me\" section of your Blogger Profile.Idiot.

Funkjester is simply and honestly verbalizing what many of us have suspected. Though the personal rants, uncalled for...Funkjester is clearly onto something. Fact is that Tailor is yet to open and delayed by one full year. This must be costing a fortune--not to mention staff. Have they a stipend budget to retain essential kitchen personnel? Perhaps fewer \"Dinner with the Bands\" and more focus on getting the business up and running will suffice. I haven't yet given up. You can do it, Sam.

A Friday Flogging? It's a rough way to start the weekend but it has to be done. Even though that new glassy hotel on Thompson Street is definitely a go (barring the collapse of the financial markets of course), it seems we got the developer wrong. A Little Birdy who just loves to dish out punishment says, \"The developers are Brack Capital Real Estate, not Brock Capital Group (whoever they are)...I got this straight from another hotel-industry source.\" And we got it straight from you. Still no renderings though. Now if you'll excuse us, we need to find an ice pack.

Two Little Birdy's with two tidbits from Wednesday night that we have to pass along.1. LB numero uno reports, \"I was walking along Bowery last night around 10:30 and noticed that the Bowery Hotel was having a party on it's roof space. There were no photographers, no grand rope scheme, just one blonde girl with a clipboard. I asked blondie who was throwing the event, and she told me it was a 'private event'. No shit.\"2. LB numero two says, \"I just passed by Cafe Bari and noticed that they had a velvet rope set up outside that second door leading to Upstairs. I didn't see a door man, but think there was one lurking behind the glass door. There was no crowd waiting to be let in either.\"Let's digest. Noting the lack of event planny type staff and activity, The Bowery could very well be in soft open. Or it could have just been a private party since the space is available for anyone to rent for a one off. As for Upstairs, you didn't think a little publicity would shut the place down did you? Puhhlease.

RE: Bowery... um, they've been doing private events for a LONG while now. The company I work for is looking to do an event in November, and we went for a walkthru, and we were told by the special events woman told us that they're chock full of Fashion Week events. Also, I think they poached their events staff from The Box... interesting.

I rang the PR about a month ago for a piece I was doing on roof top bars in NY and she assured me categorically that the roof space will only ever be hired out for private parties and that it will never be open generally as either a members or a public space. However, we all know that PRs speak with forked tongue...ps Save the Dates have just been sent for a do that Iman is hosting at Gemma for Alber Ebaz & Howard Socol on Oct 24

Just as they were poised to open their new space, have Kiki and Unik run into some community board trouble with PM? Just across the telex, a Little Birdy reports, Thought you should know that PM's liquor license came up for renewal last night before Community Board 2 and it looks like they'll vote against renewal (if they haven't already). Many neighbors bitterly complained about the noise from PM and their lack of responsiveness to the concerns of the neighborhood. PM's manager, Gordon Adams, was there with his attorney. Adams tried to explain that the noise had improved since they put in insulation and sound limiters in March but that wasn't good enough for the Board because PM had apparently signed a memorandum of understanding 3 years ago which detailed all the steps that PM would take to limit the noise. PM was supposed to do a whole bunch of things to minimize the noise but they never did.Interesting. They aren't the first club to hit CB 2 trouble, and certainly won't be the last. But you can bet your bottom dollar that if PM does go down, another club will not replace it. The rents are just too high and landlords are looking to maximize revenue through leases before the overall bottom falls out. Consider this developing . . .

A funny note came over the wire about the oh so popular out of the gate Gemma. It seems they are oh so strict when it comes to showing ID's. A Little Birdy, perhaps a humming bird, writes, I walked into Gemma last week to meet my girlfriends for dinner. When I arrived, one of them was pleading with the bartender to be served. He simply refused to do so unless she showed him some ID, which she had left in her fiance's pocket. It's not like we are some 19 year olds or anything. One of the girls even said, 'Come on, she's almost 30.' Can you imagine? The bartender turned it over to the manager, who wouldn't budge, so we all chipped in to give her money for a cab so she could go get her passport. When she came back the bartender gave her a free drink, which was nice. Oh, and the food was pretty good too. Slow down there Little Humming Birdy. Wow, that story is long. We haven't really heard about a restaurant being that strict in a long time. Good to know that the folks at Gemma really do respect the law.

It has been well established that Daft Punk threw down last Thursday. We emphatically agree. Onward. After the show ended, those in the know headed to Studio B in Greenpoint for the official after-party. It isn't exactly close to Coney Island, but it was well worth the trip. The after-party was put on by Ed Banger Records, the label headed by French electro pioneer Pedro Winter, who just also happens to manage Daft Punk. Mr. Banger, who DJs under the name Busy P, took over the decks after the rare live DP show. Good move. Busy kept the Coney Island crowd moving, and what a crowd it was. The party brought together an old-school mix of eclectic New York - everybody from French house-heads to Williamsburg hipsters to the odd B&Ter. Not too long after we rolled out, the sun came up. We laid down and called it a night. By far, the party of the year. But it's only August, so we still have a ways to go.

We are starting to hear some very interesting coming from Sam Mason's corner of the Lower East Side. The former WD-50 man is getting ready to to open Tailor and his rep for messing around with molecules is already well known, so we know the menu will have a few twists and turns. It's a given. But what is interesting to us is the drinks. We hear Sr. Mason giving whiskey the once over, giving the American classic a new twist with multiple infusion treatments. An example: Brown butter. Say what? Like it isn't sweet enough without anything, this guy has decided to spike it with a dose of brown butter. Look out! We are always up for the new, but when you mess around with whiskey, you mess around with our soul. Infuser beware.

After yesterday's bombshell, one of our lovely commenters kindly asked for a bit more information. Fair enough. We put in a call to our crack detectives, the Hardy Birds, to see what they could snoop out. It turns out not too much. But we did come across something ourselves. On the Hotel Gansevoort's lovely homepage, they have links to their other properties. Included in said links is Gansevoort Park. We pulled out our thinking caps and realized that this could only be the new name of their second Manhattan hotel. The link just takes you to a Coming Soon page. Oh well, we can still rejoice. Another mystery solved!

The Hotel Gansevoort. It helped steer the meatpacking district to legendary shit show status. Its owners are close to opening the Miami edition. Los Angeles may get one too. So what is next for the most boutiquey of NYC boutique hotels? Why, it's another new New York City location. A little birdy tells us, \"plans are well underway for a new Gansevoort to open on Park Avenue South in the low 20's. They will open Miami first and then fully ramp up construction on the new New York location.\" Wow. Consider this a slap at the well established W Union Square and a bit of Gramercy competition for Ian Schrager's Gramercy Park Hotel. As for an opening, we are still not sure. Let's put it at early 2009.

We just barely pulled through a close call on Spring Street. Do we have the strength to overcome another shocking closing? We just have to. Last night, an East Side Little Birdy told us, \"I'm on my way to SSam Bar and just saw that Simone, that cafe/bar on St. Marks and 1st, is closed. There is no note on any of the iron gates.\" If it's permanent, and let's pray it's not, then it is a shame. Simone was always an easy spot to grab an afternoon drink, and this City can always use more of those. Image courtesy of Maria Marie/Flickr!

It seems there couldn't be a worse time to open a club on 27th Street. But that hasn't stopped some of Miami's hottest shots from setting their sites on West Chelsea to make their grand entrance on the scene. Remember, Mansion is coming to the old Studio Mezmor space. If New York's biggest nightlife players are ready to abandon ship, why does Eric Milon and the Opium Group think that they will be successful? It turns out they have a genius plan. Says our Miami Birdy, \"they believe that if they put the tables for bottle service on the massive dance floor, they will have another Mansion hit.\" Tables on the dance floor? Ah, tables on the dance floor! We get it. We so get it. Can we also make a suggestion to increase profits? Here goes. What about charging at the door? That way people pay to come in and pay for drinks. Look out J.P. Morgan, we think we have our next billionaire.

Alright you out of towners, listen up. In-towners, you better listen too. We got news from the hotel game, and it sure seems pretty. According to a precious Little Birdy, it looks like Soho is about to get a new hotel. Says our LB: A new hotel is being built by Brock Capital (who the fuck are they?). The location is the corner of Thompson and Broome, right across the street from 60 Thompson. Given some building constraints (they can't go that far underground), the hotel will actually have a lobby located above the ground. Guests will enter a glass elevator on street level that takes them up to the lobby. Word is there are going to be some other quirky design concepts. Some subs who are involved in the planning stages are saying that the design is going to be pretty crazy and should give 60 Thompson a run for it's money. Wow. We had to stop typing for a second to catch our breath. Glass elevator! Where do they come up with this stuff? We predict a 2009 opening. Feel the heat!

We stopped by the Waverly Inn for a hot minute recently. Pretty good. But what we found most interesting was the cocktail menu, which gave top billing to Absinthe, the once forbidden spirit derived from wormwood. To be certain, we aren't talking about the spoon/sugar/fire technique. The tenderhorns behind the bar are serving up an both an absinthe/gin Martini and a Sazerac that has an absinthe boost. A bit too gimmicky for us, especially when their Old Fashioned comes with muddled fruit (a big no no) and they don't know what a honeysuckle is. But what they make, they make well. For $15 a drink, they damn well better.

\"Absinthe Boost\"...it is how they were originally made, we here in the US have been forced to make do with Herbsaint or pastis

yup. absinthe is used to \"wash\" the glass in an authentic Sazerac. Pastis variants have been used instead since the ban.now that Lucid Absinthe is legally imported, bars are starting to get ahold of it. (pick it up...at $65 a bottle it's well worth it....the real thing. not the fake crap you pick up in Prague.)

gimmick? pull your head out of your ass. absinthe has always been a key ingredient of many classic cocktails. before meatheads had vodka and red bull and before vodka even became popular, it was all gin-based cocktails. absinthe and green chartreuse were key ingredients. waverly may seem gimmicky to you, but not an absinthe cocktail.

Tired of the same old Circuit parties in the same old places? Us too. Good news. There are two new spots that are about to be made available for events. First, a Little Birdy told us that Richie Akiva and Scott Sartiano's 1OAK is not quite ready for the public, but will be ready for the private, saying \"they are letting event planners know they will be ready to host fashion week events.\" That's like, only a month away. Yes! Also, the spaces at Six Columbus, including the required roof bar, various penthouses and Blue Ribbon Sushi are ready to be booked. All you have to do is call. What are you waiting for?

While the world is atwitter over the impending opening of Six Columbus, the Blue Ribbon boys have quietly gone about their business. The BR empire is poised to open their first uptown location, and apparently, they looking to add some new features to their current sushi menu. Or so says a Little Birdy, noting \"this place goes way beyond the others. They are having the sushi, and adding a full raw bar and Japanese barbecue section. The menu will also be available to the hotel's guests. Apparently they are trying to revolutionize hotel dining.\" Muy interesante birdy. Muy muy interesante. We love revolutions. What say you, Hotel Guru, about their plans? \"Every new hotel that opens says they are poised to revolutionize the industry. Hasn't happened yet, and I doubt it will start now. But I do think this is a winning combination.\" We agree Guru. Back to you Ken.

We don't want you to feel like we have left you hanging. So we used our DBTH skills and technological advancements to break down Upstairs. Starting at the bottom right and moving clockwise. Raise your hand if there are any questions.1. The main entrance to Cafe Bari. You can enjoy their food or use their staircase to try and go Upstairs.2. Behold! Door #2. A back entrance to Upstairs, or so we are told. Also the entrance to an international product mart. 3. Behind those dark curtains, Upstairs.4. More curtains.5. Again, curtains. You get the point. Call your model and celeb friends, and let them know you are ready to get in on the secret. Or you can tell them DBTH sent you. But if you do, promise to let us know how it goes.

Ooooh secret bar. Oooh so secret. Oooooh Danny A. Oooooh how do we find out more. You want to know more? You want to know more? We'll tell you more! Without further adieu, a very special Little Birdy. It's actually housed in Cafe Bari, in the upstairs part of the resto. The place turns into a nightclub a few nights/week. We were clued into the fact that it was the right place because there's graffiti in the back hallway with a big \"Upstairs\" graff. Then you go in the back door to the restaurant. Who we assume was Danny A. was sitting there with some important looking people, looking/acting really pissed, reading the Post, looking at papers, on their blackberries. A couple of times he yelled at the waiters - we're assuming because that's where they think the leak came from. Yelling at the waiters, nice touch. To add a few more details, the space has been long planned and is permitted. Like LB said, don't expect a 7 day a week celeb-a-thon. Danny A. and Co. only plan to let you upstairs a few nights a week. 7-Up? We dig.

2008-01-03 02:37:00
we went to this bar for new year's eve and it was the worst new year's experience that i've ever had. after spending way to much money for a \"vip\" table, we had to wait outside for 30 minutes, because the bar opened an hour later than the tickets said. then, i was forced to take off my jacket after walking up the filthy staircase, because they had a MANDATORY COAT CHECK in place, where they made you pay $5 and give them your coat. keep in mind the tickets for the table were $500/person.we found our table for 8, which was only the small end of a bench with a tiny table. they served us PLASTIC cups, and did not pour a single drink for us. the service was horrible. i asked for real glasses, and was told we couldn't have them. we had to drink our grey goose out of plastic beer cups. the only nice people in the entire place were the bus boys, other than that the service was horrible.there was no regulation to the \"vip\" area...so my midnight it was so crowded, my feet had been stepped on 3 times, and random people were drinking our bottles.having such a horrible experience at this place, we decided to leave by 1:00.oh, and another thing...they had 2 bathroom stalls for the entire place, so if you had to go it was a 30 minute wait each time. horrible, horrible, horrible...i would never go into this bar again even if someone paid me.

Place was sick...Lots of 6 foot supermodels, celeb appearances by Wilmer Valderrama and Robert Iler (AJ from Sopranos), and great music. I have never seen a better looking crowd in NYC. Near impossible to get in, but worth it. The Vip area is not regulated at all and anybody can walk in/out, but who cares. Great place.

A little birdy reports, \"I was walking home Friday night and noticed a new bar open a few doors west of Sweet and Vicious. I popped in and was told I had entered Noble Food and Wine. Wine bar up front and food in a small room in the back. The bar had 6 stools and a few small tables. They were hosting friends and family. It officially opens for business Wed night.\" Solid LB. Very solid. We are offering 10 DBTH points for a First Responder report. Act fast.

Urban Daddy did a write up on it today: \"The cozy, split-level spot is separated into two main areas: a small marble and mahogany wine bar up front and a dining room in the back subtly lit by four chandeliers. Stick to the front bar and bring a date who has an appetite for exploring multiple glasses of vino (a worthy qualification if we've ever heard one).Noble sets the gold standard for by-the-glass wine with its brand new $15,000 Enomatic Enoline 8 sitting behind the bar—an argon gas preservation system that keeps wine fresh for two months after uncorking. What this means for you is the opportunity to sample some of the world's most sought-after wines (Chateau Lafite Rothschild, Richbourg) by the glass (or half glass) at the bargain price of $25 to $80 per glass. Plus, unique tastings, like verticals (same producer, different vintages) and horizontals (California cult wines) all from a 150-deep bottle list. The American-leaning food presents a variety of different flavors like Quail with Black Mission Figs and Chanterelles, Red Snapper with Saffron Manilla Clams or Fried Oysters. But just consider it as optional absorption to help you get through a few more glasses.Which always seem half full.\"

It's time for another edition of Dear DBTH, where we do our best to answer our faithful reader's questions. Unlike most places, we're always open.Dear DBTH,What is the standard for ordering specialty drinks at a relatively fine-dining establishment? I joined a friend for a semi-double date and when, the waitress came around, one of the girls asked the waitress if the bartender could make her a 'Wet Pussy' shot. I was embarrassed, and the waitress quickly answered no. Shouldn't we establish some kind of system for what is and is not appropriate?To be honest, we thought that any semblance of a proper upbringing does establish this kind of system. Obviously we were mistaken. But for those who don't know, let's proceed. When dining in any restaurant, it is never proper to order a shot or drink who's name is also relatively vulgar. Even if it sort of exists. This excludes established cocktails like 'Sex on the Beach', which every bartender and waitress already knows. However, if in a bar, you can feel free to ask for anything, as long as you can tell said bartender how to make it. They are, or at least should be, experts in drink creation, and should try to accommodate you. A server in a restaurant should not be put in that kind of position. We suggest being more selective in your dating practices. Or sign your friend up for charm school.

The owner of Dune is in fact Matt Schendell (Dip, Honey). I can't say exactly how the profits are shared, however Matt is there every night greeting patrons, and because his name isn't as publicized as Noah or Jayma, it has served me better to drop it at the door of the club during peak hours.\" Great job LB.

By all accounts, the folks behind Dune are having a pretty good summer. The place is filled during the weekends. There haven't been any headline grabbing incidents. Missy Elliot even had her birthday there. But we were wondering, who actually owns/runs the joint? All the usual names have been mentioned. Noah, Jason, Jayma, Opie. Oh, and Paige Restaurant Group. Wait, a minute. Paige Restaurant Group? Who are they? After a bit of snooping, it turns out they own Dip in Murray Hill and Honey on the outskirts of the Meatpacking District. You don't say. Their business cards also list Dune as one of their properties. Classy touch. Anywho, with all the players in the Hamptons for the summer, is it possible that the owners of a fondue spot are actually calling the shots? Perish the thought.

After the initial shock wore off from Vig Bar's possible and untimely demise, our intrepid commenters have come through to calm the nerves. Apparently there has been a management turnover at the Spring Street watering hole, not to mention a small run in with the SLA. Says our commenter, \"The sign on the door said that they were forced to be shut by the SLA for 2 infractions going back to 2005. Looks like they lost their appeals. But the mandatory shuttering was only for 1 week. They'll re-open this Thursday.\" Huzzah! Being closed must have put a dent in their bottom line. Why doesn't everyone pop in there sometime soon for a drink and show some support.

Uh, you *like* the Vig Bar? During the week, maybe? On a Friday or Saturday night, it's all drunk people in cocktail dresses and button-downs \"letting loose,\" which nowadays means obnoxiously yelling or crying in a craven imitation of celebrity misbehavior.

We may have lost an old friend over the weekend. A little birdy says, \"Was meeting some friends at Sweet and Vicious over the weekend. As I was approaching, I noticed that Vig Bar was closed. The iron gate was pulled down, and there was some kind of sign in the door. I couldn't read what it said though, and didn't head over there to look.\" Wow. Vig Bar seemed to be doing alright. They also seemed well positioned for the nightlife shift that is taking place. We certainly didn't see this coming. Hopefully, it was just a one off thing. Calls to the establishment went unanswered. Consider this developing.

It's been a tough stretch for our readers at the Beatrice Inn. Late last night, we received the following:Just got back from a failed attempt to hit the Beatrice Inn for the first time. There was no line, there were no outside smokers, just a small door man(SDM) with a bad haircut and a bouncer type. It looked easy enough. When my friend and I approached, the following happened.SDM: Which party are you with?Me: Actually, we aren't with a party.SDM: Sorry, can't do it.Me: Can't do what?SDM: Let you in.SDM (looking down): And you are wearing flip flops. That goes against our dress code.Me: What's the dress code?SDM: No flip flops.Me: Well, ok, what if I had a Star Trek symbol on my shirt right here, would that help?SDM: Maybe.We walked away after that. What a douche.Ouch. That is a terrible experience. One bad evening can be random, two in one week reeks of a pattern. Love the Star Trek comeback though. Definitely some weekend food for thought.

It's no secret that Belvedere Vodka has run into some recent trademark issues. We turn to our Importing Guru for some background, who informs us, \"basically, Belvedere Winery has sued the importer of Belvedere Vodka, Millennium Import, which is a subsidiary of luxury goods behemoth LVMH. A judge recently ruled against the vodka and as of now, Millennium has suspended all sales, marketing, distribution and fulfillment of orders of the product.\" Sucks to be LVMH. So while word of a relaunch has circulated, the real question waiting to be answered is what will the new brand be called? The rumor had been B Vodka (terrible), but a loose-lipped Little Birdy in the know tells us, \"Belvedere will be re-branded as White Star Vodka. White Star is a brand that LVMH already controls as part of the Moet family of champagnes.\" We don't drink much vodka, but we guess that works. Give us a White Star on the Rocks. Give us a Dirty White Star. Rolls right off the tongue.

Normally, we would rather head out of town than uptown. There are always exceptions, and this is one of them. The buzz over Jason Pomeranc's Six Columbus has been building for close to a year. The over-hyped, much delayed reno job has had many false starts, but observers are all atwitter with rumors that the hotel will be open soon. It's time to certify these rumors. You know what time it is. Little birdy time! Give it to us birdy. \"Six Columbus is laying down the finishing touches. Look for the joint to be open for guests in the middle of August. Like the week of the 12th. Oh, and look for Blue Ribbon to open simultaneously, not like Gemma's delay at the Bowery.\" Explosion! That's hot Little birdy. Too hot. Burn ourselves. So hot that we are going to continue to stay downtown. But please, feel free to let us know how it looks.

We love getting mail from our readers on any topic. Even if they happen to disagree with us. Writes one reader, Hey DBTH, After your glowing review of the Beatrice Inn, my friends and I decided to check it out. What were you thinking? There were so many hipsters with ray bans and fedoras and lots of new order playing, it was laughable. Oh, and they had no AC, so it was just a bit warm inside.We sure are sorry you didn't have fun. But we must point out, our report was from March, and it is now July. You know how fickle the scene is, don't you? Fedoras are a sure sign of the B team. Most kids are dressing like the Iron Sheik these days. Plus, the summer season is upon us. What were you still doing here this weekend? We chalk this up to poor timing, and will make a return trip to the Beatrice in the fall. Got some a tip, news, gossip, or a questions. Please let us know. The Hipster Phone is never low on batteries.

The bounty of fruit that summer yields has reached its zenith. What better way to enjoy it than in a cocktail. #1 on our list (so far), the Black Cherry Daiquiri, brought to you by the fine people from East Side Company. May we suggest spending one of your weekday nights sitting at their bar to enjoy this and several other of their creations. Only $11. Same as a movie ticket, and certainly a more enjoyable experience. Carry on.

If your idea of fun is watching movies you have already seen in a pleasant outdoor setting, for free, than you are in luck. New York is full of such options. But with so many choices, how can one possibly decide which to attend? Luckily, you old friends DBTH are here to provide some help.1. The Brooklyn Bridge Park Conservancy hosts Thursday night movies with a view of Manhattan. Top Picks: The Princess Bride (7/5), The Muppets Take Manhattan (7/19)2. L Magazine takes over the McCarren Park Pool on Tuesday nights. Top Picks: Dazed and Confused (7/17), Bonnie and Clyde (8/14)3. Bryant Park, the original, stays with the classics every Monday. Top Picks: The Sting (7/23)4. Central Park also gets in the game with a limited schedule. Dates vary, so check the listings. Top Picks: Stuart Little (9/1)Never forget, nightlife in New York is more than just drinking and the like. But, people have also been known to drink at these events. Or so we are told. Just don't forget the brown paper bags. And recycle.

A normal summer weekend in New York City is slow. A semi-holiday summer weekend is very slow. Not the best time to open a restaurant. Or is it? A DBTH commenter dropped a weekend bomb on us, sayingGemma the restaurant at the Bowery hotel opened last night (Friday 29th) - no tastings, no private parties, just simply opened the doors at 6:30 - by 9:30 the place was packed! The food is delicious, the wine fantastic and the service impeccable - especially considering it was the first night. It is a gorgeous space with no detail left unconsidered - like the hotel it is a knock-out! Where were you?Unfortunately, we were away on official DBTH business. And the praise seems a bit too praisey, if you catch our drift. However, the space is very well done. We attended a small get together there a few weeks back. Thankfully, we can now rest peacefully knowing Gemma is ready to go.

Went to Gemma on Monday night. I live down the block on Lafayette so decided to try it out and see if it was worthy of being a new neighborhood spot. I went relatively early (630) but the place started to fill up pretty quickly. The Branzini was DELICIOUS. It was so good that it trumped everything else we got. The pizze d' salsicia (or spicy sausage pizza) was just okay. The one at Pala is much better. The almond cake with raspberry puree dessert tasted alright. Nothing special. Overall I liked the place. The cheese was fresh, the prosciutto, sobresata were fresh and delicious and the wine was reasonable and paired well with our meal. I will definitely go back again. The service had more to be desired. The service was like dating an investment banker... it seemed that they forgot about us, then remembered and would be all over us, then forget about us again and on and on. I think the service was just suffering from the new opening pains that all restaurants go through though.

Says reader Jon:As a 19 year old college student in the city for the summer, I find it extremely difficult to find anything good to do without the need of an excellent fake ID. Perhaps you could write a column (or solicit your readers' advice) and publish a list of good clubs/dance parties/concerts and such for the under 21 crowd.While we can't do the list, we can solicit advice. Tips are welcome in the comments or through the Hipster Phone. Our suggestion? Find an excellent fake id.

Last week, we briefly mentioned the materials that are being used at the Bowery Hotel's second story bar. It's time to revisit them. There is a bit more to discuss. Ready?1. The boys scored an entire building's worth of vintage bricks from a nearby building site. Cost? $3000. Actual retail cost today would have been 7 figures.2. Srs. Goode and McPherson (along with others) scoured the surrounding area (venturing to other states) for vintage materials that could be incorporated.3. When said materials were found, the space was redesigned if necessary. This happened multiple times. It helps keeps the workers on their toes.4. The tiling is pretty slick ta boot. (ta boot!)Like we said before, the entire thing is more than a home run. It's a grand slam. If only they would let us in.

Stephen Starr, the restaurateur that private equity longs for, is on the move. Well, at least his restaurants are. Pelican, a little Florida birdy, sings, \"Starr is coming to the W Hotel and Residences in Ft. Lauderdale to open one new restaurant. It's either Buddakan or Continental. Hotel opens in early 2008, Starr will open soon after.\" Interesting. Very interesting. We thought Starr was concentrating on getting Continental opened in New York. Maybe that's off. Not too big a deal, because the place really is an expense account special. You won't miss it.

This weekend marked the kickoff of JellyNYC's summer Pool Party series at McCarren Park Pool. A little birdy on the scene filed this report, noting, \"things are almost exactly the same as last year. Dodgeball, slip and slide, Brooklyn Beer, food from the grill and hipsters galore. What is different is the heavy sponsorship from Helio, that weird phone thing that is advertised everywhere. They had set up a mist tent, a sales booth, and some other tents with lounge chairs for a few lucky guests. I saw most of the event staff running around, not using Helios. Superchunk wrapped up at 7, and that was it. Energy was a bit off from last year. Maybe the novelty is gone.\" Maybe birdie. Maybe. Perhaps everyone is just getting warmed up. It's going to be a long, hot summer. Can we get more mist tents spread around for the rest of us? Thanks.

As the 27th Street scene crumbles, it's time to check in with the area's most successful venue. Marquee. Yes, we know it isn't on 27th Street. But it's close. And apparently, it's still going strong. A little birdy reports, \"was at marquee last Tuesday (don't ask) and it was completely full of young models. So much fucking talent. I have been in a place in nyc that stacked in a long time. I hate the place, but it was fucking unreal. And had Derek Jeter on one side of me and Maroon 5 on the other.\" Maybe hate is a strong word birdy. And we wish you would be more respectful to women. But we are glad you had fun. Please keep us posted.

Prepare the Floggine Machine. We were under the impression that Richie Akiva and Scott Sartiano's next project was going to be in the old Spa/Plaid space. It looks like we may have been mistaken. A little birdy writes, \"Richie Akiva and Scott Sartiano of Butter (and of dating Meadow Soprano fame) are opening their new club on 17th between 9th and 10th. The working name is 1OAK (One Of A Kind).\" Genius. Unless the bar is made out of kryptonite, we somehow doubt that this place will live up to its name. Whatever.More importantly, the tea leaves have been read and the tarot cards flipped. It is now official. Break out the DBTH stamp and have it notorized. 17th between 9th and 10th is the new 27th between 10th and 11th!!!

There has been some wild speculation this week about the status of the second floor/roof top space at the Bowery Hotel. After first disclosing some general facts about the room, we are now ready to share a bit more. But DBTH, how do you have more to share? We thought it wasn't open? Well, it isn't open. But they are preparing to open. Last week we happened to be given an all access tour of the space. Aren't you lucky? Let's begin.1. The space is huge, and the indoor/outdoor quality is beyond unique for a lounge in the city.2. Fungibility. This space has it. A capability to have a private party, large or small, and still be open to the public. 3. Pool tables.4. Vintage materials, corralled from some unlikely sources. (More on this later)5. Bars fabricated by a master European craftsman. 6. POS systems behind said bars. This baby is ready for commerce.Take a minute to catch your breath. Better? Good. A bit more patience and admittance will be granted. In the meantime, may we suggest you hug a cop? We said it. Hug a cop.

We are stepping into the way back machine on this one. Almost four months after we announced that Bobby D et al would be installing Ago in the Greenwich Hotel, along with some other choice details, Mr. and Mrs. Rush and Molloy have decided to break the same exact story. Good effort all around. Our original little birdy also notes, \"They not only rip you off, but they got it wrong. David Rockwell really didn't design it. The folks at Greyling did.\" Thanks LB.

Not satisfied with just bringing you the best in nightlife for Singapore's former British Imperialists, DBTH had to take in one of the world's great nightclubs: Zouk. Zouk has been around for 16 years and put Singapore on the map as a global party destination. A routine stop for international DJs from Deep Dish to Danny Tenaglia and Roger Sanchez to Erick Morillo, Zouk has a reputation as one of the most dynamic nightspots in the world. It's quirky owner completely renovates the club every few years, and we're not talking minor renos, but new designs that are consistently featured in Wallpaper* Magazine.A few years ago, the owner decided to go upscale by opening a higher-end spot next door called Velvet Underground. Patronized by Singapore's jet-set elite, the place is decked out with the owner's incredible modern art collection. There are a half-dozen Warhols on display, Takashi Murikami lithographs, a large format Romero Britto behind one bar and a wall-size Keith Haring. Our favorite: A Warhol Mao portrait. Interestingly appropriate in a city that is 75% Chinese.

If we are one thing, it would have to be worldly. Thus, sometimes we will have to excuse ourselves from Gotham and head On Location. We don´t live in a bubble, and to make sure you don´t either, DBTH will fill you in on what the world has to offer.On Location: SingaporeSingapore is much more than a place where Americans get cained and gum chewing is illegal. It just happens to be a place where they know how to make a cocktail. Which we appreciate. Thus, our first stop was of course the Long Bar at the Raffles Hotel. For those who do not know, the LB created one of the world´s most infamous cocktails, the Singapore Sling. We had to head to the source. Walking into the bar you could feel you were in a piece of nightlife history. Interesting twist: the bar has pigeons flying around in it and baskets of crunchy peanuts on the tables. Unique. The classic Sling has gin, cherry brandy, grenadine, cointreau, pineapple juice and bitters. Normally too fruity for us, but to be honest, it was pretty damn tasty.

Is it to be just another liquor store in a neighborhood awash with them? It turns out our guess was pretty spot on. How can we be sure? Well, Sakaya´s owner Rick checked in to clarify, saying, ´´We hope to have our liquor license by the end of the month....stay tuned, you're right about the synchronicity with Tinto Fino.Kanpai. ´´ Kanpai to you sir.

Without asking for it, your friends at DBTH have become a popular target for publicists. We find that odd, because most of them really dislike bloggers. Rest assured, the feeling is not mutual. That means you Gail Schoenberg! We've got (almost) nothing but love up in here. Today, just for fun, we'd like to point out one of the more comical PR blasts we receive. Every so often, Jenna Jameson makes some kind of public appearance, and a few days later we hear about it. Here is a sample:Sex icon and adult film mega-star Jenna Jameson demonstrated her international appeal last weekend, strutting the runway for a good cause at the annual Life Ball 2007 in Vienna, Switzerland, marking Europe's largest charity event in the fight against HIV and AIDS. The weekend, highlighted by fashion house Heatherette, was filled with money-raising events.\"Being a part of Life Ball 2007 was an incredible honor for me,\" says Jenna. “HIV and AIDS awareness is a top concern in the adult industry and I felt it was very important for me to show my support towards the non-profit organizations that do their best to combat this overwhelming disease.Congrats Jenna and congrats to Life Ball! Sounds like a great cause. Please keep up the great work and please keep up posted.

Speaking of brunch, DBTH happened to be brunching this weekend at the American, one of our favorite new spots, and saw some changes. Don't worry, these are good changes. Besides the big menu, solid food and short table waits, the American has come through with an expanded dining room. No longer are those booths in front the only seating option. There are several four tops available in the back, plus a bonus outdoor patio where one can enjoy some summer heat. Or a cigarette. If you enjoy that sort of thing. Apparently, it's been that way for two weeks. Next step: A Bloody Mary license. Hopefully.

Remember that stealth Japanese restaurant we told you about? The one that was being planned for the basement of the Bowery Hotel? Well, it seems things have changed just a little bit. Our little birdy from Miami checks in (Hello stranger) and let's us know, \"Sean and Eric were in Miami a bit ago, hanging out with their buddy Andre B. They were so impressed with his hotel spa that they are building one at the Bowery in what was planned restaurant space.\" Translation: Eric Goode and Sean MacPherson were hanging out with Andre Balazs in Miami and are now using his spa as an inspiration for their hotel. See ya Japanese restaurant. That's OK by us. We have more than enough overpriced sushi joints. Editor's Note: Normally, this would call for a Flogging, but we were initially correct. We can't help it if they change their fickle little minds.

The Whole Foods on Bowery opened big a month ago. A big party, tasting events and the like. But from an insider, things haven't been going so great. The place is apparently empty during the weekdays, generating a little more traffic at night and then filling up with weekend shoppers. How do you change that? Well, WF Bowery has an idea. A little birdy writes, \"I walked by Whole Foods LES tonight and saw that they will be serving brunch starting June 10. You have to talk to a custie service person to get details, but I was late for dinner.\" That's ok birdy. We still love you. Now, we know retail is not our specialty, but brunch definitely is. We can picture it now. A big Saturday night on the town. You wake up, feeling like $5 bucks. All you are thinking about is brunch. Solution? The City's biggest supermarket, full of bright lights, loud shoppers, and piped in market music. That's where we want to get our rancheros. And scene.Photo Courtesy of Electric Stove/Flickr

Whole Foods empty on weekdays and still quiet at night? I fail to see the problem. Birdies at USquare or Col.Circle that wait at the end of a check-out line where a disgruntled employee holds a sign wrapped around the salad bar saying \"Line Ends Here\" will agree: quiet aisles is a good thing (especially when you aren't the one paying rent in those high-price locales)

This small retail space on East Ninth Street seems pretty unassuming. The street is mostly small boutiques with a few exceptions. Veselka being one. MUD being another. But this store may just throw a little wrinkle into that scene. Coming soon is Sakaya, a small retail space specializing in sake. But DBTH, isn't that just a liquor store in rice wine clothing? Maybe. Or maybe it will be a small gem of a store where clerks will be able to help customers match the proper bottle of sake for each occasion. Perhaps the Tinto Fino of Sake. And there ain't nothing wrong with that.

The big M Day weekend has come and gone. We are still getting our heads around the reports that came in. But if you happened to be in the Hamptons this weekend, it seems the nightlife scene can best be described as shit show. From all accounts, the NYC clubs that have established Eastern outposts were simply not ready for the hordes that descended upon their red velvet ropes. One birdy in the know says, \"we heard people with table reservations waited outside Pink Elephant/Tenjune for over an hour because they were not ready at 11:30pm on Saturday night.\" Sounds like fun. We know it's opening weekend, and only the best doormen on earth could prepare themselves for the attitudes of those who are supposed to be inside and the begging of those who need to be inside, but it's tough to defend service like that. But that's why we don't go to the Hamptons.

GoldBar made a statement with their location choice and their liberal use of, well, gold. Not to mention their drink prices. It seems obvious that they would also take their door policy next level. So how did they do it? A little birdy who has spent some time in Russia reports, \"behind the gold mirrored front windows, GoldBar's host and owners utilize a 'face control' policy where they stare down prospective party-ers from the safety of a trick mirror and let them in based on appearance. Seriously straight out of Moscow. Not that we're complaining, but the club itself was full of old French men with their sweaters tied over their shoulders and their mistresses. Not fun and thumbs down.\" Old French men? For all that hassle, we would expect just a bit more.

Cain's premature exit from the East End left a gaping hole in this summer's Hamptons scene. Luckily for you weekend warriors, Noah Tepperberg and Jason Strauss are there to save the day. Dune, this summer's inhabitant of Jet East, is a Noah and Jason production, which may or may not liven up this summer's social scene. Probably the latter.

You could say we are excited for Gemma. Or you could say we are just a sucker for little birdy's who go the extra effort with their cameras. Maybe it's a little of both. A weekend peek behind those lacy curtains has birdy fluttering with anticipation, singing, \"Gemma is officially ready to open. Furniture is in, glasses line the bar (pictured above), there is even some freshly chopped wood in front of the pizza oven!\" Oooh, we love us some fresh cut wood. Makes it good. But we have some bad news for you. We know that Gemma's not quite ready for John Q. Birdy. But it is ready for the privileged. Private parties kick off next week. You know where to find us.

***CONTENT
Welcome to the second installment of the DBTH series, On the Circuit, which chronicles a select few of the many sponsored events held in New York City on any given night. Books, fashion, music, movies or miscellaneous, if you can think of it, it's a pretty good bet that there is some kind of event happening. Usually, if you've been to one, you've been to em all. But some stand out, and DBTH will be On the Circuit to keep you informed. Because hey, free booze.Our second installment: Microsoft ZuneApparently not satisfied with Zune's market performance, the folks at Microsoft decided to throw a little party Tuesday night to generate some buzz. Location was the Beatrice Inn, already established as a DBTH favorite. Marky Ramone was DJing. All signs pointed towards a fun, if not interesting, event. We're in.The party called for an 8:00 start, so we arrived a bit after 9. Of course. After pressing towards the bar, we were amused when Eric the bartender dismissed a patron for trying to add a few drinks onto an already completed order. \"That's not allowed here,\" said Eric, earning him a spot in the DBTH hall of fame. We grabbed our drinks and headed to the back room, secured a table, and settled in. Zune was the only sponsor. Translation: Open bar, which is never a bad thing. Marky was spinning rock n roll, with a generous helping of his own tunes. We would do the same thing. The event didn't feel like an event. It just felt like a normal evening at Beatrice. LiLo even showed up. Hello.Alas, it was just an event. At 11:00, it was all over. The bar cleared the party out to prepare for the late shift. Fine by us. Congrats to Microsoft for a job well done. But with the software giant playing host, we were reminded of the quiet nerd from high school who is left home alone for the weekend. Said nerd throws a party and it turns out to be a rager. We even wound up with a free Zune. Now we feel special.

Next weekend is Memorial Day. That means it's time for the masses to fight traffic and overpay for a small bed in a crowded house in the Hamptons. Nightlife involves really overpaing to get into the summer installations of Manhattan nightclubs. Uh, no thanks. But for those of you who are into that sort of thing, we have some bad news. It looks like Cain is sitting this one out. An ocean loving birdy on his way north for summer checks in, saying \"Cain will not open this summer in Southampton as previously planned. There was talks of sharing space with Pink Elephant, but it never happened.\" Oh well. For those of you who need a non-Manhattan Cain fix, may we suggest their new outpost at the Cove at Atlantis. It just opened last weekend, and from all accounts, is spectacular.

***CONTENT
One great thing about an evening at The Anchor is you never know what you're going to get. We arrived last Friday evening and were promptly encountered by a gentleman at the door asking if we were there for a party. That's always thought a weird thing to ask at a bar. Of course. Once inside, two other oddities were to be found. First, the crowd was thin- or thinner than normal for midnight. Second, they were playing hip hop. Definitely not the norm.We made our way to the table where an acquaintance was celebrating their birthday. Bottle service, another surprise. But the biggest surprise was still to come. At the adjoining table, cloaked in hoodies, was Bron Bron and the Jigga himself. Lebron James and Jay Z at The Anchor. They were joined by a few girls, bodyguards and the owners of Stereo. To honor their presence, the DJ played Hova's records all night. Having global celebrities in a down and dirty bar like the Anchor helped get things next level. It's a jolt of energy that even the tightest jeans wearing hipster can feel. And when they rolled out around 1, the party rolled on without them.And the evening illustrates the potential of greatness of New York City. You can go to a the hipsterist of dive bars and wind up sitting next to a top 5 NBA'er and the biggest hip hop artist around. It's the unexpected that keeps us interested and out. Not many other places can say that. Sorry Cleveland.

Some nightlife news to begin the week. PM's superstar owners Kiki and Unik are moving to expand their empire. A little birdy filed a weekend report (sorry it waited until Monday. We were out.) saying \"Kiki and Unik have picked up the lease at the old gay club XL and are opening a new club. Looks like a late 2007 opening.\" May we suggest naming it AM? MONDAY AM BONUS: Another little birdy gave us a little tip. It seems that Scott Sartiano and Richie Akiva have taken on some partners for their expansion into the old Plaid Space. Says birdy, \"Scott Sartiano and Richie Akiva's partners on the project are Jeffrey Jah (lotus, double seven) and Ronnie Madra (pink elephant).\" What a foursome!

While the city went gaga over David Bowie and Sting's partnership with Ivan Kane to bring 40 Deuce to Little Italy, we had some other things on our mind. Then we got an interesting email. Says our little birdy, \"I am half surprised that it's headed to that neighborhood. i was under the impression it was going to be westside. I knew for a couple of years that they were looking, then a broker i know supposedly found them a space. In fact, there was a thing on it in page six, so I thought it was a done deal.\" You know something birdy? We remember that too. Unfortunately, the post's archives suck. But we found some textVAN Kane's Forty Deuce is finally coming from Los Angeles to New York. Seven months after we first reported on the plan to export the burlesque-themed boite, a deal was inked Wednesday afternoon with Sting and David Bowie as partners. Kane is set to take over the space at 539 W. 21st St., which was tacky teen club Crush. Not that you can blame Ivan and company. We've been trying to tell you that Chelsea is in trouble.

Don't expect to see a second Shake Shack location any time soon. A little birdy who lives in Central Park tells us, \"Danny Meyer's Union Square Hospitality Group entered into negotiations with the NYC Parks Department to put a Shake Shack in Central Park, but a deal could not be reached. The sticking point was the lease term, with USHG wanting a long-term deal, but the parks department not willing to give any more than 5 years. USHG has a 9 year lease on shake shack in Madison Square Park.\" Those wanting to wait in a ridiculous line for an average burger will just have to go to the original. Let us know how it goes.

It's probably to their benefit to have a short term lease. This ridiculous burger-craze will bust at some point and I wouldn't want to be stuck with a long-term lease if people stop buying burgers! Also, no food coming off a grill is worth that wait - there is a Wendy's across the street, and I'm sure a street-meat guy somewhere near the park. Just as tasty.

An early morning dinner is the perfect way to wind down a night out. More than pizza or the proverbial BEC, several gourmet establishments serve into the wee hours, catering to those in the service industry and flaneurs like us. It just so happened that after a few cocktails one recent evening, we happened to stop in to one such establishment, Momofuku Ssam Bar, for a mini feast. Since David Chang's skills are beyond established, there is no need to discuss the food (delicious!). However, there was a new libation we happened to try. The kitchen scientists have begun experimenting with Nigori, mixing the unfiltered rice wine with soda water. The result? Cloudy sake soda. But in a good way. You know? A huzzah for pushing the beverage limit. Huzzah!

About a month ago, we got word that there was a secret club throwing rotating dance parties every so often in New York. Invitations were given only upon request, and credentials were needed. It sounded intriguing, so we set out to gain admittance. Upon our request, mm sang our praise, saying \"have checked your blog. you witty little lobster.\" And like that, we were in.Like underground dance parties of yore, invitations and directions came the afternoon of the party. A group was put together and plans were made. The invitation called for midnight until late, so we knew that things wouldn't really get started until the early morning. Sit back, it's going to be a late one. After having a few drinks to get warmed up, we piled into a cab and went to the secret spot, a no man's land location on the west side. Through a metal door of a nondescript 2 story building. Give our name at the door, DBTH +3, and we are in.But just where are we? The space looked like a VFW meeting house in a state of disrepair. Wood paneled, industrial carpet, the whole nine. Two bars were set up, and the scene was laid back. 3 rooms were used as lounges, with the fourth being the dance floor. The system was loud, professionally done, and impressive. House music blasted through the speakers, and a euro flavored crowd was getting down.By 3:00, the place had filled up. Every room was packed, and the scene was most definitely anything goes. German DJ legend Sven Vath had stopped by, and since he was enjoying himself, asked if he could get behind the decks. Of course. So he went home, got his records and took over. And with that, the party went to the next level.A bit later and we decided it to call it a night. Some stayed, some went on to the next party, but we packed it in. Serious kudos for anyone who can throw a semi regular event like this. Who could do it every week? Surely not us. But every so often, it's a nice change of pace from the hustle and bustle of chasing the perfect cocktail. Unfortunately, that's all we can tell you. Some things need to be kept secret.

It seems Crif Dog's new secret bar on St Marks has embarked on some kind of disinformation campaign. Luckily, we eat Lucky Charms. Our last box had a secret decoder ring, which we used to crack the code. Just kidding, we just used our Little Birdy Weekend Courier service to dig out the truth. Birdy checked in late night, saying \"At Crif Dogs. Drunk and tried to get to the bathroom, but almost kicked down the door to new bar. Pierced counter girl told me it's not called Please Don't Tell. PDT stands for Porno Dog Tavern. Can order dogs at the bar and beers at the dog shop or something. Opens next week. And I just took down a Chihuahua, Spicy Redneck and tots.\" Damn. That's a lot of Crif Dog for one little birdy to take down. Hope you are feeling OK. Take the Porno Dog name for what it's worth. Definitely an improvement on Please Don't Tell. Color us impressed.

Welcome to the Down By The Hipster Op/Ed Section, where columnists pen pieces on issues they care deeply about.By Birdy RooneyIn today's wacky world of interspacewebnotics, it's tough to keep a secret. Every Madison, Pace and Juan Juan is carrying around a camera ready to send it to their favorite media outlet. We know this. We love this. But if you are opening a business, and aspire to keep it low key, there are ways of managing the information. You can stay under the radar for as long as you want.When we learned of the new, \"secret\" bar, being opened by Hot Dog titan Crif Dogs, we were intrigued. Access is restricted, seating is limited. Sounds hot. They even named the place Please Don't Tell. And then they launched their PR Campaign. And we don't know why. Why name a place Please Don't Tell and then go out and announce it to the world? A better name would be would \"Hey Look Everyone, Small Bar, Good Drinks Available Here!\" The logo could be a map.If DBTH wanted to open a secret bar, we would build the space, hang a small sign, and hire a bouncer. Then we wouldn't let anyone in for 3 months. No press, no customers, no nothing. Then we would roll out the invites. That's how you secretly open a bar. We are willing to teach any prospective operators on just how to launch secretly. Just drop us a line and we will set something up. Don't worry, no one will know. It'll be our little secret.

We've got nothing against a standard drink. Lord knows we've had enough bourbon, whiskey and even vodka (we were just kids, chickies even!) on the rocks to make Norm Peterson gag. But nowadays, we love us some specialty cocktails. Obviously. On that note, behold the East Village's newest specialty cocktail bar, SB3, located appropriately at the corner of Avenue B and Third Street. Let's turn it over to our little birdy, who tweets, \"The replacement for the old 3B is finally opened. SB3, short for 'Sexy B 3'. I was walking by and saw the required bottles of fresh squeezed juice so I figured they had a nice cocktail list. It's 2 pages long and looks like a winner. They also serve traditional American food, but I didn't see that menu. They are in soft opening, with grand opening in 2 weeks. It's open late too, with live music coming downstairs.\" Quite the report little birdy. You are thorough. The name isn't our favorite, but what's in a name?Paging An Evening At!The extensive SB3 cocktail menu.The cocktail list was crafted by Mixologists Marty Vaz and Matty Gee.

Despite our warnings, Eric Milon and his Opium Group minions have their hearts set on bringing one of their Miami venues to Chelsea's club graveyard. After our little birdy overheard Milon the model discussing the space, a second, more knowledgeable little birdy (we think Owl's are probably the smartest bird, so we shall call them Hooty the Birdy) confirmed that the Studio Mezmor space will be getting a makeover. Hooty says, \"Milon and Opium Group are indeed coming to town. They are turning the old crobar into the New York outpost of Mansion. Look for a fall opening.\" First time/long time that someone from SoBe has tried to bring their act to New York, but give them credit for taking the risk. This also makes moving Cain and Sacco's decision to relocate Bungalow 8 seem that much smarter.Thanks to mARky/Flickr!

Behind those lacy curtains is Gemma, the Bowery Hotel's soon to open Italian restaurant designed by Taavo Somer. The last time we passed by, the place was still pretty much under wraps. No more. A little birdy walked by and snapped this pic, saying \"the restaurant is getting close to being ready. There are lace curtains hanging over all the doors and windows and when I peered inside, I could see the furniture had been delivered. Wasn't set up though.\" Dirty birdy. We think there are laws against peeping like that. It's OK. We won't tell. Looks like it's time to sit back and wait for our invite to opening night. We think we deserve it.

DBTH, the restaurant looks like a pizzeria! I peeked through the lace curtains to view a brightly lit room and clear view of pizza ovens and sacks of flour for pizza dough. Very interesting, especially given the intense competition in the East Village for Italian eateries. Any word on the chef?

Is New York ready for an invasion of Miami nightlife? Well, ready or not, here it comes. A little birdy checks in, saying \"was eating lunch at Cirpriani Downtown and overheard Eric Milon discussing some available spaces in NYC. Specifically, he was discussing taking over the Studio Mezmor (formerly crobar)space.\" Interesting little birdy. Very interesting. Perhaps these Miami folks think they know something about the 27th Street area that NYC operators don't. For those who aren't familiar, Milon is a former model turned nightlife player who owns and operates the Opium Group in South Beach and is expanding into Vegas soon. Where have we heard that before? Will a New York version of a Miami nightclub fly? DBTH is betting on no. Unlike in Miami, we can't wear pastels all year long.

Actually... I'd give the Opium Group a little more credit. I grew up in the clubs in NYC (SoundFactory, Limelight, Tunnel, etc) And now I spend my winters in Miami working for clubs Nocturnal, Space and Cameo (old Crobar) to name a few and I have to say that I'm more partial to the Miami scene. It's more about fun and the music and its like a family once u get to know the other locals. Cant say that too much about NYC anymore unfortunately. We'll see what happens I guess... I'll sure be hittin it up and promoting Mansion once it opens.BOSTON~www.myspcae.com/Nakima

Hipster, as used in the 1940s, referred to aficionados of jazz, in particular modern jazz, which became popular in the early 40's. The hipster adopted the lifestyle of the jazz musician, including some or all of the following: manner of dress, slang terminology, use of cannabis and other drugs, relaxed attitude, sarcastic humor, self-imposed poverty, <A HREF=\"<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.enterbet.com\"\">http://www.enterbet.com\" REL=\"nofollow\">sportsbook, and relaxed sexual codes. Early hipsters were generally white youths adopting many of the ways of urban blacks of the time, but later hipsters often copied the early ones without knowing the black origins of the culture. The term eventually described many members of the Beat Generation.<A HREF=\"<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.enterbet.com\"\">http://www.enterbet.com\" REL=\"nofollow\">http://www.enterbet.com

When it comes to spirits, we are a bit particular. You know this. But it doesn't mean we won't mix it up now and again. Especially with whiskey. Extra especially with rye whiskey. After all, it is the Champagne of 2007. So we were excited when a little birdy filed a report for our favorite new rye's coming out party. Tuesday night at the Four Seasons, Lenell's played host for a Manhattan flavored party for Tuthilltown Spirits small batch rye. Says our birdy, \"Lenell Smothers from Lenell's in Red Hook made the 'perfect Manhattan' at the tasting. It was 1 1/4 (maybe 1 1/2) shot of rye whiskey equal parts, 1 oz, dry (French) and sweet (Italian) vermouth. This is combo is the key that makes it a true Manhattan the members of the Manhattan club made it. The bitters that were used were Fee Brothers bitters from Rochester, NY, our local bitters maker. Then you have your choice of a cherry or burnt lemon peel. She went burnt lemon peel and it was amazing. I hate whiskey and I had two.\" The drinks obviously pack a punch, since it took our little birdy a full day to give us the scoop. Careful little birdy, that stuff is strong. Very strong.

Welcome to the first installment of a new DBTH series, On the Circuit, which chronicles a select few of the many sponsored events held in New York City on any given night. Books, fashion, music, movies or miscellaneous, if you can think of it, it's a pretty good bet that there is some kind of event happening. Usually, if you've been to one, you've been to em all. But some stand out, and DBTH will be On the Circuit to keep you informed. Because hey, free booze.Our first installment: Burton 2008We got word that LA DJ Steve Aoki had been booked to spin a Radar event at the Burton Snowboard Store in Soho to preview Burton's 2008 collection. After arriving at the store and finding it closed, a quick recheck of the invite showed that it was being held just down the street at the Burton showroom in a loft high above Broadway. Pass quickly through \"security\" (DBTH +1), we cram into the elevator to head upstairs and enter into the event that is already in full swing. The skinny: The room was full to very full, and Aoki, most known for his weekly party with DJ AM in LA, was spinning to an enthusiastic crowd. The bars were plentiful, with a choice of jalapeno margs, vodka mixers and the like, while a kind wait staff passed out mini burgers and dessert to those who dig that kind of thing (No thanks, we already ate). Most fun: the instant photo booth in the corner. Most surprising: the event actually picked up steam as the night wore on, definately not the norm. Instead of trying to pack the room with C listers and hired models, Burton et al put together a real party. Drinks, DJ and dancing, a tough combination to beat. If it wasn't for all the Burton gear on the wall that you couldn't try on, we could have been anywhere. But it was a showroom, and it wasn't a big deal. And we all got a new t-shirt to boot. How about that?Be sure to check out some photos at our DBTH/Flickr page.

More news from the club beat, and this time it's full of Earth Day inspiration. Over the weekend, a little birdy landed on our window sill. Since the sun is out, the window was open and we could hear the little birdy chirp, \"word on the street is that Home and Guesthouse's Jon B (his bio is a must read!!) is opening an eco-friendly 'green' nightclub in the low 20's between 10th and 11th.\" We know green is the new black, but we didn't think it would make it to the nightclub business so quickly. Since he is such a trend setter, maybe Jon B is tapping into a new market of kids who are into music, the environment and going out, but aren't your typical club kids. You know, the wookies!

We recently revealed MHG's plan to open the Mondrian at 150 Lafayette, which is Chinatown's answer to the Bowery Hotel Row. But why now? And why the Mondrian? And why there? When in doubt, turn to your hotel guru to drop some wisdom. We did, and HG says: Morgans wouldn't exist if it weren't for Ian Schrager's vision and creativity. But he got bought out and Morgans was taken public. Since then, they have announced grand plans for expansion, including franchising some of their brands- unthinkable under Schrager. The Mondrian Scottsdale was the first to open. I was there on opening weekend in January and was disappointed with the quality of the renovation of the Old James hotel. The next Mondrian to open will be in SoBe, followed by the NYC property, then Vegas (which Shrager is obligated to be a part of). No doubt Morgans will be bringing in the big guns for the NYC. The competition is stiff and they want their old leader to be slain by his own child.Well, it's more bastard child. Or step. No matter, the battle lines have been drawn, with Morgans ready throw down against the Gramercy Hotel with its premiere brand. If hipsters had money to gamble, we'd be taking Shrager all the way. You know why?Because Ian Shrager is an original, just like us.

These days, if you want to open a world class restaurant, you better hire a world class mixologist. Some out of town restaurateurs are obviously aware of this, so they set up a meeting with Master Mixologist Alex Ott (Sushi Samba, Buddha Bar - Paris, Bao 111) to craft specialty cocktails for a few new establishments. Luckily, your friend DBTH was invited along to observe. And taste. And taste we did.The location was a downtown dive bar where you wouldn't expect to find exotic drinks and NASA based technology. That's right, NASA. We walked in and were given a 12 page booklet and scorecard for the 55 drinks we would be tasting over the course of 3 hours. You do the math, because we are still tipsy. Alex not only comes up with unique recipes for your bar, he also comes down and trains the neophyte bar staff on how to make each drink. Hire him and a new establishment can wow you with exotic fruits, insane spices and world class cocktails that will go perfectly with your menu and keep its prices down. Genius.The tastings were crafted for a new tequila bar and gastropub opening in Somewheresville, USA, so the menu was influenced by Mexico City trends for the former and classics for the latter. But Alex shook things up with some groundbreaking twists to leave the group, including an executive chef and sommelier, truly wowed.We know, it sounds too good to be true. It almost was. Luckily, we have some evidence. So feel free to cruise over to our brand new DBTH Flickr Page.YAY. Flickr.

We have a secret. It's a big one, but it should be alright if we tell you. You just have to promise not to tell anyone else, ok? Swear? If you don't swear, how can we tell you? Ok, now we can tell you. See, 150 Lafayette has been mysteriously wrapped up for a few months. The place is being gutted, and we know why. The building, which previously was the Chinatown Dialysis Center, is being converted into a luxury hotel. And this isn't just any luxury hotel. This is the widely anticipated Mondrian Hotel - NYC. That's right, the Mondrian is coming to Chinatown. The project represents Morgans Hotel Group's triumphant return to New York City. Crazy right? We know. The work is being overseen by the conversion experts at HTO. They even have a permit! The hotel will definately have some big name restaurant and nightlife establishments, but no contracts have been signed with anyone. Now remember, you swore not to tell, and a promise is a promise. Otherwise, we may not be able to tell you anything ever again.

It's time for another installment of the DBTH ongoing series, An Evening At:, where we document the ins and outs of New York City nightlife. Openings and closings, dive bars and lounges, hipsters and B&T, DBTH will be on the scene and letting you read all about it, because for better or worse, it's all we have. Some local operators had brought in an out of town chef who may be taking over an out of town restaurant, and they were nice enough to bring us along. Dinner was over and the hour was early, and the visiting chef was asked what they wanted to do. Chef says, \"I'm beat from the flight, maybe just a place to get a good cocktail.\" Enough said. Milk & Honey, Sasha's original haven in the Lower East Side, is still unique for its location, atmosphere and drink quality. The number recently changed, but there is no need to call anymore. A quick text to the bar with a table request, and the helpful staff is quick to respond. \"Your table will be ready at 10:30, see you then.\" Perfect.Our group walks over and steps up to the door, gets buzzed in and led to our back booth. The smiling server is kind enough to help guide Chef through the process, and since we know the skilled Tender knows his way around an Old Fashioned, we ask for a Tequila - Bartenders Choice. The wait period between order and arrival is enough to make a serious drinker shake with excitement, waiting to see just what we will get to taste. Ours was a Tequila Honeysuckle, a creative play on the wildly popular Bourbon version, with just enough honey, cointreu and fresh squeezed lime juice to make us want to have another (two). There is no extraneous noise, no cell phones, no pushing or shoving. Just concentrate on the world class cocktail, your company and the fact that while the rest of the city is dealing with the madness, you have been granted access to the land of Milk and Honey.We know the joint's rules on pictures, this photo is courtesy of Baaderonixxxxxx/Flickr

Normally, we wouldn't dream of two posts in one day. After all, we aren't Superman. But this news was so hot that we couldn't just sit on it. This morning, we told you that Bunaglow 8 was following its neighbor Cain off of 27th Street. Now, another little birdy of the night (Batman?) lets us know, \"It seems Cain is moving to a spot on 17th street and 9th Ave.\" Sadly, we can't find the listing, but surely someone can. Expect Bunaglow to follow with some kind of Page Six leak about its pending move sometime in the next week.

There has been a lot of Amy Sacco news recently. We don't want to overdo it, but there is just a little bit more. Grab a seat because it's a whopper. Some nocturnal little birdys tell us, \"Bungalow 8 will be shutting down on 27th Street and relocating downtown.\" HOLY MOLY! The 27th Street original and Bunaglow flagship is abandoning its roots, with Sacco leaving the hood for the B&T to run amok. Sounds fun. All kidding asisde, Bungalow 8 was an area pioneer. Accordingly, It seems logical that Sacco made plans to abandon 27th Street before Cain, but kudos to Cain for getting the news out first.So what does this mean for NYC nightlife's bottom line? By now, it's obvious that 27th Street is officially dead and the the new trend is clear. Downtown baby! With Gold Bar, the Box, 205 and the new Scott Sartiano and Richie Akiva joint opening soon, downtown has its grimy grip firmly wrapped around the neck NYC nightlife, ready to choke those uptown players out of the game forever. That's why Bungalow and Cain are giving up on their original homes, ready to make a move to re-establish their brand names at a new venue. A bold and risky move by any means, but one that had to be done.If you live above 14th Street, it may be time to call your realtor. Photo courtesy of Lock/Flickr

It seems Starwood Capital CEO and hospitality visionary Barry Sternlicht's buying spree may not end with B.R. Guest. A little birdy let us know that Philly's most famous (and pompous) restaurateur may be the next target for Sternlicht's firm, saying \"Starwood Capital may be looking to buy the Starr Restaurant Organization and then make a play to take back control of Starwood Hotels.\" Hmm, Starr just made a successful move into Atlantic City (Continental, Buddakan) and NYC (Buddakaan and Morimoto), and with Continental NYC coming soon, why sell now? We needed an explanation, and since we our just a blog (but a great blog at that!), we turned to our hotel guru, who explains: Long a loss leader in the hotel business, hotel restaurants have become an important part of of the future of the business. After the death of the hotel dining room, hoteliers and restaurateurs have had a hard time trying to figure out how to work with each other (witness Rande Gerber and Ian Schrager, Alan Yau and Schrager, Chodorow and Schrager, etc.). Some hotel brands have done long-term deals (witness W and Jean-Georges), but visionaries such as Sternlicht are realizing that restaurants done right can be vertically integrated into the hotel model and attract business. Consider us impressed. Expect to see W hotels filled with Dos Caminos and Continentals popping up in towns near you (and you!) soon. Guess it's better than Barca 18.

Eating Good At The Cooper Square Hotel

***CONTENT
The Cooper Square Hotel will soon be joining the rest of the Bowery Hotel Gang. Our Gawking friends announced some details involving the CSH's entertainment venues, but they missed out on some of the fantastic back story. Thankfully, a little birdy filled us in:I happened to speak to one of Meridian Restaurant Group's partners last winter. Meridian(separate from chef/partner Govind Armstrong) is best known for LA's Table 8, opening Rok Bar LA (a tremendous failure) and L Scorpion Tequila Bar, both in Hollywood. Said partner told me he was opening a restaurant at the New Cooper Square Hotel with 'celebrity chef' (and Applebee's pitch man) Tyler Florence. That deal may have fallen through. Govind Armstrong has more appeal as a star chef, although he is much better known on the West Coast. He recently opened Table 8 in Miami for Meridian in a shitty space at the new Regent Hotel between Ocean and Collins, and it opened to tepid reviews. Best bet is Meridian is opening Table 8 NYC at the new Cooper Square Hotel and not just a Govind Armstrong restaurant. While the pending opening of Table 8 NYC is exciting, we can't help but weep for the lost potential of a Tyler Florence space. Imagine, being able to sit in a new hotel's lobby and taste the tv star's take on riblets, wings and other Applebee's favs. That's what eating good in the neighborhood is all about!

Monday monrings are rough, no matter how you slice it. We appreciate the little things that help kick start the long week, like a classic weekend report about everyone's favortite DJ's. A little birdy tells us:I was walking west on Spring Street on Saturday night and as I was walking by Don Hill's, I noticed a dude passed out laying on the sidewalk with his head propped against the side of the building. It was freezing and nobody was outside and he was in a t-shirt. I also noticed a guy trying to revive/argue with him. I noticed the dude on the ground was one of the MisShapes and so was the guy leaning over him. No idea which was which, because they look like twin muppets. Anyway, one of two things was happening:1) He was trashed 2) He was in a tizzy. Maybe it was both. I'm not sure what happened, but they we're causing quite a commotion. We told you it was a great way to wake up. It's going to be a fun week.

It's been a while since we caught up with the Bowery Hotel. Since our last update, we have heard some very mixed reviews. A little birdy showed up one night and told us, \"the place was dead, the drinks were fair, and there was no music. None. It was like being in an abandoned nursing home.\" Ouch. That's one angry birdy. We had to see for ourselves, so we grabbed that birdy by the feathers and dragged him back for a second visit. The results were mixed, since the place was crowded, dare we say packed even, and our little birdy notes, \"the glasses seem new and improved.\" That's something. But we wonder why there is still no music, the service was so bad and why all of the furniture is so uncomfortable? For a space that begs you to sit and relax, the re-upholstered furniture forces you to want to get up. Someone call Jenny and get some couches down there! But then we recall that the lobby is really supposed to just be a lobby. The Bowery has much more coming and soon. How soon? Very. But DBTH, how can you be so sure? Well, another little birdy lets us know, \"the second floor bar space is just about ready. The bar is installed, but the hotel's elevators and a dedicated stairwell are not quite there. The space is huge, close to 10,000 square feet, and they are waiting for the weather to improve before opening for the public.\" Thanks little birdy. We'll keep that in mind.

You may already know this, but we go out. Sometimes, we even go out in Brooklyn (gasp!). We go where the fun is, and sometimes that is across the river. As the night winds down, your party flags down some cabs and heads back over the Manhattan Bridge towards home, you remember that there is some delicious late night food waiting for you nearby. Great N.Y. Noodretown is already well known, but the proprietors have just taken things to the next level. Soft Shell Crabs are back. Fact. You stumble in, wait your turn for a table and order up a plate (or six) of the summer speciality. Even though the portions are smaller and more expensive than ever, NY Noodletown is the home of the best (and only) late night soft shells in town, China or other. The mix of salt and crispy crust make these buggers the perfect post bar food, at least until we wake up. They are only in season until late July, so get em while they're soft.

We're getting pretty good at solving retail mysteries. We had worried that the St Marks Mystery Space had gone cold case on us, but this baby is now doing a slow burn. First, one of our instinctive commenters remarked \"Maybe a hot dog stand. There was a giant paper-mache pluto-colored Clifford inside the store a few days ago.\" Someone must have rocked their SAT logic games, because a little birdy equipped with a camera provides the photographic proof, saying \"the awning went up this weekend, place is called Good Dog, and their mascot is Clifford.\" Case closed. Maybe we should change our name to Down By The Hardy Boys.

While design, music and crowd are all vital to creating a great nightlife destination, we believe that a truly great cocktail is ingredient #1 to an establishment's success. We've already displayed our affection for the Old Fashioned, the classic cocktail that any bartender worth his salt should be able to make. An Old Fashioned with bourbon is great, but a proper Old Fashioned with rye whiskey is something special. We were pleasantly surprised when we came across a New York State rye from the Tuthilltown Distillery, a mill that has been in operation since 1788. The mill, which has now been converted to a full distillery, has crafted a small batch rye that is destined to shake the high end cocktail market up. Tuthilltown is the first distillery to legally make grain spirits in New York State since Prohibition, and while pricey, packs a flavor that true cocktail lovers will enjoy. Besides, like a nightlife guru tells us, \"Rye is the Champagne of 2007,\" making Tuthilltown the Moet of rye. How can you argue with that?DBTH will never shill for anyone. EVER. When we find a product worth mentioning, we feel a duty to share and share alike. If there are any questions regarding this policy, please feel free to let us know.

Amy Sacco's grip on the NYC scene has been slipping. Lot 61 is gone and Bungalow may as well be. So what is the Queen of NYC nightlife to do? Sell out of course. After recently opening the London edition of Bungalow at St Martins Lane, a little birdy tells us \"Amy Sacco has entered into a significant deal with Morgans Hotel Group. She will be opening and/or overseeing a number of venues in existing and future Morgan's Hotel deals. They just bought out the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino Las Vegas and the Mondrian and Delano are both opening at Echelon Place in Vegas in 2010 so expect her to make a big splash in the desert.\" Interesting. But that isn't for 3 years. Seems like an awfully long time for Amy to sit on the sidelines. Oooh, what's this? A second little birdy tells us \"expect something from her soon in the notoriously slimy Miami club market in one of the current Morgan's properties or perhaps the future Mondrian South Beach.\" We better call our travel agent.

***CONTENT
Welcome to the first installment of a DBTH series, An Evening At:, where we document the ins and outs of New York City nightlife. Openings and closings, dive bars and lounges, hipsters and B&T, DBTH will be on the scene and letting you read all about it, because for better or worse, it's all we have. Our first installment: A weeknight at Beatrice Inn.As dinner winds down, a little birdy tells us it's time to head to out. A quick walk and suddenly we stroll past the Bouncer with a handshake and a smile and are inside the Beatrice Inn. Low ceilinged and sparsely decorated, things are quiet early in the evening. With no cocktail menu but a promise from Angela that \"everything is really good\", we order an Old Fashioned and take a seat on a banquet in the front room. A designer is smoking next to us, and an LA guy gives a birthday girl a shirtless lap dance. Classy. The drink arrives and it's all wrong, full of muddled fruit like Grandma drank in Ought 7. To set the record straight, the proper recipe is as follows:1. Sugar Cube2. Bitters3. Bourbon or RyeMuddle 1+2, Add 3, Shake, and garnish with a citrus twist. Since Angela has disappeared, we're stuck with the fruit. We follow the LA Boys, birthday girls and the rest of the crew to the Back Room, where the dance floor is heating up. It's strange to see real smoke inside a New York bar. We missed you. Bad 80's songs get the models dancing like it's Fudgie the Whale and we can't help but dig the vibe. The fact that it's a weeknight and the late hour makes it a scenester kind of night. Even as the back room packs up, the front stays quiet and accessible. After a few hours, we'd had enough.Beatrice Inn is almost hitting on all cylinders. It reminds us of a used car with that new car smell. Or maybe that was just Matt Damhave. But like so many other NYC joints, Beatrice's inability to combine the party with a spectacular cocktail leave us wanting just a little bit more. But everyone inside had a good time, and in the end, isn't that what really counts? Of course not.

Was inexplicably at the 'Inn later then I should have been on the weekend and agree fully with your assessment. great atmosphere, back room is genius for the vibe--danced like a lunatic. the drinks are definitely on the \"nearly but not quite\". however given how much fun everyone is having I am willing to let that drawback slide.

There is just something special about the old NOHO buildings. The brickwork and design transports you back to New York's golden days. On this note, we were so very pleased when a little birdy told us what would be replacing the old Astor Wine shop that moved down the street last year. The conversation follows:DBTH: What's going in here?Little Birdy: WalgreensDBTH: Walgreens?Little Birdy: WalgreensDBTH: You don't say.Why didn't we think of that? The high ceilings, large floor plate(but not too large, you know how pharmacies like narrow aisles), and proximity to Duane Reade made this a natural spot for Walgreens to further expand in NYC. With its GAP, B&N, Kinkos, Starbucks, Coldstone Creamery and now Walgreens, old Astor Place is poised to challenge 5th Avenue for NYC shopping supremacy. Thanks to Tabby Lee/Flickr for the photo.

It's time to check in on the hotel scene once again. We head down to Tribeca, where Robert De Niro et al are preparing to open their first hotel. After breaking the Ago news, we have some additional details on the hotel, including the official name. Let's begin.1. In a genius act of branding, the Greenwich Street property has officially been named the Greenwich Hotel. Again, genius.2. According to a little birdy who has taken a tour, the hotel rooms are mostly on the small side. There are \"a few really sweet duplex suites.\" Sweet.3. The designers used hand crafted bricks from a special Pennsylvania brick foundry. Apparently they use some ancient brick making formula so each brick is unique.4. There are some really cool arches in the building made from said bricks.5. \"It will make the Bowery Hotel look like a Red Roof Inn.\" - Little BirdyWe assume more details and hopefully some images will appear in the coming weeks. Expected opening is sometime post summer.

As all of you know, blogging about newspaper items isn't our usual beat. However, when a newspaper item touches on one of our own items, we take notice. This is one of those times. Unfortunately it's on a Sunday, which is also the DBTH day of rest (Bastards!). Last month, we pointed out that Neck Face, a guaranteed starter on the Hipster All Star Team if there ever was one, had in fact sold out. While we never support vandalism, it seems that the Neckface/Vans billboard has been visited by the Splasher, who must fancy themself as the Robin Hood of grafitti (Fact: They aren't). Because of the vandalism, Vans has pulled the ad a week early and New York is temporarily missing a billboard. We aren't going to cry over that.

A few restaurant setbacks has not knocked the Gramercy Park Hotel totally off course. With spring finally arriving, preparations are underway for the mandatory hotel roof bar. A little birdy let us know, \"I was just at Gramercy Park Hotel for a meeting. There were all these people unloading large quantities of flowering trees and shrubbery into the service elevator. They said it is for the roof-top bar which should be opening soon.\" We're giddy with excitement, especially since the ground floor Rose Bar staff go so out of their way to make you feel welcomed. Maybe they will give you a little shove off the roof for poor tipping.

It happened again. We aren't the brightest bulb in the bulb tree, and sometimes we get things wrong. And when we are wrong, we want need to be punished. SEVERELY. This morning we discussed the possibility of Stereo being for sale. A special little birdy with a special little singing voice sung us a clarification song. Apparently, there is really a bar called Secret Lounge. Sounds lame, and since its for sale, it probably is. No matter. Our birdy says, \"The Hard Sell venue is actually called Secret Lounge, though I wouldn't be surprised if Stereo was thinking about packing it in too.\" Oooh little birdy, you're as bad as we are. Maybe you want a flogging too.

This week, the good folks at Eater ran one of their semi-weekly Hard Sell columns featuring a \"secret night club\" on W. 29th Street that is on the market. We did some sleuthing and determined that current B&T hot spot Stereo is on the market. Random speculation you say? Hell yes. But still, the address Eater gave was 525 W. 29th which is actually the Paul Sharpe Gallery. Stereo is right across the street. Plus, an international nightlife guru and DBTH fan tells us because of high expenses, \"the Stereo guys have never made any money.\" That hurts.Finally, we have real photographic evidence. KFed was given a mike to perform there. Once that saliva touches your PA system, its definitely time to sell.

After only being able to glimpse at the outside of Eric Goode and Sean McPherson's other and totally super secret hotel just off the Bowery, we have finally been granted access. Well, virtual access. A little birdy directed us to the now live site for the Lafayette House Hotel, which is in a word, slick. How slick you ask? Well, each of the 15 rooms has its own working fireplace, C.O. Bigelow (who?) amenities and 500 thread sheets. That's a lot of mofo threads! Reservations are now being accepted, but only if you send the good folks at LHH an email. We live here, so don't expect us to do it.

C.O. Bigelow is the pharmacy / lab / personal care guru on 6th Ave below 9th St. They make incredible products. I'm assuming their soaps, lotions, and other skin care products will be the line exclusively used in the hotel. That's a HUGE step of from the generic shampoo / conditioner combos that a lot of places offer.

It is all boarded up in front and should be the biggest club opening of the Spring.\" A few more like this may help raise NYC nightlife from the dead. Probably not though.BONUS: It seems that Butter is also expanding, with a Little Miami Birdy (A seagull perhaps?) reporting a new location will open in the old David Barton Gym space at the Delano Hotel in South Beach.

A mysterious storefront has been erected on St Marks place, a few doors down from the now rentable Dojo.

This could mean 2 things:1. It's not a pizza joint.2. They will only have 1 kind of pizza.We wait with baited breath until some kind of sign is erected.

Despite the difficulty in gaining Community Board #3's support for new establishments that serve alcohol, many new businesses require the boozy revenue that serving drinks provides. Honesty ain't working and lying isn't such a great idea either. What's left? Begging! A new coffee shop that is vying for a wine and beer license has posted this cry for support in its window, asking community residents interested in espresso, Cabernet and a good stout to show up at CB 3 meeting to convince the old codgers on the board that what First Avenue needs is more booze. Odds of success? 12:1.

Dojo, the original rat (and cockroach!) infested, Asian inspired, bargain priced eatery on St Marks that was shut down by the Board of Health will not be coming back, despite their promise to do so. There is a For Rent sign in the window and the place is in the process of being gutted. Maybe it was the cheap pitchers, maybe it was the overcooked burger curiously served on a stale pita, but for some reason this place was pretty popular. The NYU branch is still going strong, but the St Marks location is gone, and nothings gonna bring it back.

Lost in the frenzy over the Bowery Hotel, another Sean MacPherson and Eric Goode hotel has flown way under the radar to become the most sought after reservation in the downtown hotel scene. The 15 room hotel is so stealth that we aren't sure what the name is. A previous guest told us he had the pleasure of staying at the Lafayette House, while it may also be the Blackwell House Hotel. Who knows and who cares! The 15 room hotel, directly next to the fossil known as B Bar, was originally slated to be a private guest house for the friends of MacPherson and Goode. It will now be open to the public. Well, the right kind of public, since we can't find a number anywhere. We did, however, get a snap of the buzzer system, which you can look at below. As always, we would love some more info, so please feel free to drop us a line.

Apparently, the kitchen is located in the former apartment building super’s apartment. A resolution to relocate the super took longer than expected and the restaurant was virtually finished before they even secured a deal for and started on the kitchen. No wonder McNally says this is his last restaurant. Oh the horror! At list our Little Brit persevered a now the city is better off for it. Lord knows we were running out of places to get Pasta and Wine.

It's the perfect way to end the business day or start your evening out. Sounds delicious, but really makes us wonder what kind of super-exclusive, trend setting global nightspot is this anyway?

Some interesting developments in the last few days regarding two of the more important bars to open in the last few months. First, it seems Death and Co. ran into some neighborhood opposition regarding its quasi-restaurant service. We've been to D and C a few times, and well, why we appreciate the name and above average cocktails, we are going to give it a pass. We have also seen Gold Bar go from impossible door to posing for pictures. We admit we haven't been yet, because well, we aren't that hip. But early reports to DBTH are troubling, with one birdy who has been reporting \"tons of models, cool space, and the best old-fashioned that $18 can buy.\" Seems about right, until our resident nightlife expert (yeah, we got one of those too!) saying \"They have not gotten any good pr and the opening was not as exclusive as I thought it should be, so they are trying to drum up some pr. Thing is, they usually go Page 6 or NY Mag, which makes me question what is going on if they go to Blogs.\" I guess they can bend with the best of them.Well, we like the blog PR route, since you know we are one. (And they love us). But, with Sacco-ville cooked, the irrelevant MeatPacking district, and the Lower East Side's Dunzo status, the state of NYC nightlife is in serious flux.

We all know who that means. Is there anything hotter than a publicist limbo contest to amuse bloggers? Of course not.

We admit, we're not perfect. And when we're bad, we deserve to be punished. In our excitement over the possibility of Freeman's being a part of our favorite new hotel, we got our facts mixed up. It seems Taavo and the crew will not be operating Gemma, the new spot at the Bowery Hotel. Mr. William Tigertt from Freeman's checked in to say: Taavo did the design for the Gemma restaurant at the Bowery Hotel as the architect. We do not own it, or are not going to operate it. It will be run by the same chef/group that does the Maritime Hotel, Bowery Bar, and Waverly. It has no association with Freemans.We've been a bad blogger, and we're ready to bend over and take it. We promise to be good.

We admit that we are a sucker for this Bowery Hotel thing. When we saw those first guests walking in, we were oh so jealous. So we decided that we should check it out too, and check it out we did. The place is sweet, ranking up there with the other boutique powerhouses, both in NYC and globally. That's right, globally. But we have more than just praise. We have some juicy intel. Like the bar is open for business. And that the restaurant will be of the Italian variety and is named Gemma. And that the operator is none other than Taavo Somer of Freeman's. To top it all off, there will be a super stealth Japanese joint in the sub-level that is still a few months away. So let's take a deep breath and recap, shall we?1. The Bowery Hotel is sweet.2. The bar is open for cocktails.3. The restaurant is Italian and a co-production with Freeman's.4. Stealth Japanese joint coming soon.5. Oooh, how could we forget, their website launched too.Looking good, Billy Ray. Feeling good, Lewis.

You would be hard pressed to have missed this week's shitstorm between Sir Chodorow and the Food Critic Establishment. But to us, a review of this type of establishment is worthless. These overpriced and overhyped Fusion/Theater/Rare Food establishments are not for city residents looking for a good meal. They are for the tourists and executives who are out for an evening and want to be wowed with fancy swords and overpriced beef. For proof, lets head to Miami, where an on-site tipster at the Food and Wine Expo reports \"people were tripping over themselves to go to the Kobe Club booth at the burger bash. People here love Choderow, as opposed to his nosedive in NYC.\" So rest easy JC, there is love for you out there. Just not from critics (the same who didn't like Freeman's, but more on that later).

Once there was a crappy Hollywood Video Store,Now there is a Duane Reade.Prehistoric Third Avenue sucks.The DR near Astor Place is officially open for business. We must not forget that every Duane Reade has a Chase Bank center inside, giving the East Village 3 Chase locations (Astor Tower, 3rd Avenue and 9th St, and Second Avenue Deli) in as many blocks. This is a serious challenge to Starbucks Square. Hopefully, the Green Goblets rise up to defeat their blue and red foe.

Robert De Niro's yet to open Downtown Hotel in Tribeca has finalized plans for its lobby restaurant and we have the scoop-du-jour. Ago, the LA and Miami Italian Hotspot, will be occupying the lobby space, and expect celebs and gawkers to make this one the big openings of 2007. The pairing makes perfect sense, since Bobby D and those other Tribeca heavyweights (literally) the Weinstein Brothers were chef Agostino Sciandri original partners when he jumped ship from legendary Brentwood trattoria Toscana to open the first Ago in West Hollywood a few years back. Our little birdy has also spilled the beans on at least part of the design. Apparently, the ceiling is made of 9 million wine corks. That's 9 with six zeroes worth of corkage that someone had to jam into the ceiling! Our job ain't looking half bad now.

The Bowery Hotel, Eric Goode and Sean MacPherson's latest addition to the Manhattan scene, is getting ready to open and open big. Even though the soft opening is reportedly still a few weeks away, we spotted some pseudo doormen/valets standing outside the Bowery entrance to this new \"boutique\" hotel. We also spotted what could be the hotel's first guest, the woman pictured here, get out of a cab and greet both valets with a big hug and smile. We hope that they have the same chipper attitude in 3 months when there are 600 people trying to get inside their second floor bar. It's Go Time!

Some interesting developments in the last few days regarding two of the more important bars to open in the last few months. First, it seems Death and Co. ran into some neighborhood opposition regarding its quasi-restaurant service. We've been to D and C a few times, and well, why we appreciate the name and above average cocktails, we are going to give it a pass. We have also seen Gold Bar go from impossible door to posing for pictures. We admit we haven't been yet, because well, we aren't that hip. But early reports to DBTH are troubling, with one birdy who has been reporting \"tons of models, cool space, and the best old-fashioned that $18 can buy.\" Seems about right, until our resident nightlife expert (yeah, we got one of those too!) saying \"They have not gotten any good pr and the opening was not as exclusive as I thought it should be, so they are trying to drum up some pr. Thing is, they usually go Page 6 or NY Mag, which makes me question what is going on if they go to Blogs.\" I guess they can bend with the best of them.Well, we like the blog PR route, since you know we are one. (And they love us). But, with Sacco-ville cooked, the irrelevant MeatPacking district, and the Lower East Side's Dunzo status, the state of NYC nightlife is in serious flux.

Walking down Lafayette, we came across this billboard by Neck Face, one of our favorite Street Artists. Remember Neck Face, the tag name you could rack your brain around for months and still not know what the hell a neck face was? He used to tag a lot of downtown spots, like this. We always wished we lived in a Neck Face building.Now we don't. Sigh. We cried little child tears when we saw who paid for the ad. A sneaker company. Bad Neck Face. Bad. We will never forgive you.

We admit that we are a sucker for this Bowery Hotel thing. When we saw those first guests walking in, we were oh so jealous. So we decided that we should check it out too, and check it out we did. The place is sweet, ranking up there with the other boutique powerhouses, both in NYC and globally. That's right, globally. But we have more than just praise. We have some juicy intel. Like the bar is open for business. And that the restaurant will be of the Italian variety and is named Gemma. And that the operator is none other than Taavo Somer of Freeman's. To top it all off, there will be a super stealth Japanese joint in the sub-level that is still a few months away. So let's take a deep breath and recap, shall we?1. The Bowery Hotel is sweet.2. The bar is open for cocktails.3. The restaurant is Italian and a co-production with Freeman's.4. Stealth Japanese joint coming soon.5. Oooh, how could we forget, their website launched too.Looking good, Billy Ray. Feeling good, Lewis.

You would be hard pressed to have missed this week's shitstorm between Sir Chodorow and the Food Critic Establishment. But to us, a review of this type of establishment is worthless. These overpriced and overhyped Fusion/Theater/Rare Food establishments are not for city residents looking for a good meal. They are for the tourists and executives who are out for an evening and want to be wowed with fancy swords and overpriced beef. For proof, lets head to Miami, where an on-site tipster at the Food and Wine Expo reports \"people were tripping over themselves to go to the Kobe Club booth at the burger bash. People here love Choderow, as opposed to his nosedive in NYC.\" So rest easy JC, there is love for you out there. Just not from critics (the same who didn't like Freeman's, but more on that later).

Once there was a crappy Hollywood Video Store,Now there is a Duane Reade.Prehistoric Third Avenue sucks.The DR near Astor Place is officially open for business. We must not forget that every Duane Reade has a Chase Bank center inside, giving the East Village 3 Chase locations (Astor Tower, 3rd Avenue and 9th St, and Second Avenue Deli) in as many blocks. This is a serious challenge to Starbucks Square. Hopefully, the Green Goblets rise up to defeat their blue and red foe.

Robert De Niro's yet to open Downtown Hotel in Tribeca has finalized plans for its lobby restaurant and we have the scoop-du-jour. Ago, the LA and Miami Italian Hotspot, will be occupying the lobby space, and expect celebs and gawkers to make this one the big openings of 2007. The pairing makes perfect sense, since Bobby D and those other Tribeca heavyweights (literally) the Weinstein Brothers were chef Agostino Sciandri original partners when he jumped ship from legendary Brentwood trattoria Toscana to open the first Ago in West Hollywood a few years back. Our little birdy has also spilled the beans on at least part of the design. Apparently, the ceiling is made of 9 million wine corks. That's 9 with six zeroes worth of corkage that someone had to jam into the ceiling! Our job ain't looking half bad now.

The Bowery Hotel, Eric Goode and Sean MacPherson's latest addition to the Manhattan scene, is getting ready to open and open big. Even though the soft opening is reportedly still a few weeks away, we spotted some pseudo doormen/valets standing outside the Bowery entrance to this new \"boutique\" hotel. We also spotted what could be the hotel's first guest, the woman pictured here, get out of a cab and greet both valets with a big hug and smile. We hope that they have the same chipper attitude in 3 months when there are 600 people trying to get inside their second floor bar. It's Go Time!

Some interesting developments in the last few days regarding two of the more important bars to open in the last few months. First, it seems Death and Co. ran into some neighborhood opposition regarding its quasi-restaurant service. We've been to D and C a few times, and well, why we appreciate the name and above average cocktails, we are going to give it a pass. We have also seen Gold Bar go from impossible door to posing for pictures. We admit we haven't been yet, because well, we aren't that hip. But early reports to DBTH are troubling, with one birdy who has been reporting \"tons of models, cool space, and the best old-fashioned that $18 can buy.\" Seems about right, until our resident nightlife expert (yeah, we got one of those too!) saying \"They have not gotten any good pr and the opening was not as exclusive as I thought it should be, so they are trying to drum up some pr. Thing is, they usually go Page 6 or NY Mag, which makes me question what is going on if they go to Blogs.\" I guess they can bend with the best of them.Well, we like the blog PR route, since you know we are one. (And they love us). But, with Sacco-ville cooked, the irrelevant MeatPacking district, and the Lower East Side's Dunzo status, the state of NYC nightlife is in serious flux.

Walking down Lafayette, we came across this billboard by Neck Face, one of our favorite Street Artists. Remember Neck Face, the tag name you could rack your brain around for months and still not know what the hell a neck face was? He used to tag a lot of downtown spots, like this. We always wished we lived in a Neck Face building.Now we don't. Sigh. We cried little child tears when we saw who paid for the ad. A sneaker company. Bad Neck Face. Bad. We will never forgive you.

There was one little blog related nugget coming from the sparsely attended PR Panel. Our LB reports Restaurant PR guru Phil Baltz conceded that publicists must bend to blogger's requests. said you had to indulge them until you find out which ones would be around for the long haul.

We admit that we are a sucker for this Bowery Hotel thing. When we saw those first guests walking in, we were oh so jealous. So we decided that we should check it out too, and check it out we did. The place is sweet, ranking up there with the other boutique powerhouses, both in NYC and globally. That's right, globally. But we have more than just praise. We have some juicy intel. Like the bar is open for business. And that the restaurant will be of the Italian variety and is named Gemma. And that the operator is none other than Taavo Somer of Freeman's. To top it all off, there will be a super stealth Japanese joint in the sub-level that is still a few months away. So let's take a deep breath and recap, shall we?1. The Bowery Hotel is sweet.2. The bar is open for cocktails.3. The restaurant is Italian and a co-production with Freeman's.4. Stealth Japanese joint coming soon.5. Oooh, how could we forget, their website launched too.Looking good, Billy Ray. Feeling good, Lewis.

You would be hard pressed to have missed this week's shitstorm between Sir Chodorow and the Food Critic Establishment. But to us, a review of this type of establishment is worthless. These overpriced and overhyped Fusion/Theater/Rare Food establishments are not for city residents looking for a good meal. They are for the tourists and executives who are out for an evening and want to be wowed with fancy swords and overpriced beef. For proof, lets head to Miami, where an on-site tipster at the Food and Wine Expo reports \"people were tripping over themselves to go to the Kobe Club booth at the burger bash. People here love Choderow, as opposed to his nosedive in NYC.\" So rest easy JC, there is love for you out there. Just not from critics (the same who didn't like Freeman's, but more on that later).

Once there was a crappy Hollywood Video Store,Now there is a Duane Reade.Prehistoric Third Avenue sucks.The DR near Astor Place is officially open for business. We must not forget that every Duane Reade has a Chase Bank center inside, giving the East Village 3 Chase locations (Astor Tower, 3rd Avenue and 9th St, and Second Avenue Deli) in as many blocks. This is a serious challenge to Starbucks Square. Hopefully, the Green Goblets rise up to defeat their blue and red foe.

Robert De Niro's yet to open Downtown Hotel in Tribeca has finalized plans for its lobby restaurant and we have the scoop-du-jour. Ago, the LA and Miami Italian Hotspot, will be occupying the lobby space, and expect celebs and gawkers to make this one the big openings of 2007. The pairing makes perfect sense, since Bobby D and those other Tribeca heavyweights (literally) the Weinstein Brothers were chef Agostino Sciandri original partners when he jumped ship from legendary Brentwood trattoria Toscana to open the first Ago in West Hollywood a few years back. Our little birdy has also spilled the beans on at least part of the design. Apparently, the ceiling is made of 9 million wine corks. That's 9 with six zeroes worth of corkage that someone had to jam into the ceiling! Our job ain't looking half bad now.

The Bowery Hotel, Eric Goode and Sean MacPherson's latest addition to the Manhattan scene, is getting ready to open and open big. Even though the soft opening is reportedly still a few weeks away, we spotted some pseudo doormen/valets standing outside the Bowery entrance to this new \"boutique\" hotel. We also spotted what could be the hotel's first guest, the woman pictured here, get out of a cab and greet both valets with a big hug and smile. We hope that they have the same chipper attitude in 3 months when there are 600 people trying to get inside their second floor bar. It's Go Time!

Some interesting developments in the last few days regarding two of the more important bars to open in the last few months. First, it seems Death and Co. ran into some neighborhood opposition regarding its quasi-restaurant service. We've been to D and C a few times, and well, why we appreciate the name and above average cocktails, we are going to give it a pass. We have also seen Gold Bar go from impossible door to posing for pictures. We admit we haven't been yet, because well, we aren't that hip. But early reports to DBTH are troubling, with one birdy who has been reporting \"tons of models, cool space, and the best old-fashioned that $18 can buy.\" Seems about right, until our resident nightlife expert (yeah, we got one of those too!) saying \"They have not gotten any good pr and the opening was not as exclusive as I thought it should be, so they are trying to drum up some pr. Thing is, they usually go Page 6 or NY Mag, which makes me question what is going on if they go to Blogs.\" I guess they can bend with the best of them.Well, we like the blog PR route, since you know we are one. (And they love us). But, with Sacco-ville cooked, the irrelevant MeatPacking district, and the Lower East Side's Dunzo status, the state of NYC nightlife is in serious flux.

Walking down Lafayette, we came across this billboard by Neck Face, one of our favorite Street Artists. Remember Neck Face, the tag name you could rack your brain around for months and still not know what the hell a neck face was? He used to tag a lot of downtown spots, like this. We always wished we lived in a Neck Face building.Now we don't. Sigh. We cried little child tears when we saw who paid for the ad. A sneaker company. Bad Neck Face. Bad. We will never forgive you.

Our little birdy checks in with a few tidbits to wrap up the SoBe Wine and Food Fest sponsored by the Food Network. There was no major news announced at the event, no chefs went crazy in the SoBe Nightlife, unless you count \"Anthony Bourdain and Eric Ripert sightings at the Raleigh poolside.\" Umm, we don't. There was one little blog related nugget coming from the sparsely attended PR Panel. Our LB reports Restaurant PR guru Phil Baltz conceded that publicists must bend to blogger's requests. said you had to indulge them until you find out which ones would be around for the long haul. We all know who that means. Is there anything hotter than a publicist limbo contest to amuse bloggers? Of course not.

We admit, we're not perfect. And when we're bad, we deserve to be punished. In our excitement over the possibility of Freeman's being a part of our favorite new hotel, we got our facts mixed up. It seems Taavo and the crew will not be operating Gemma, the new spot at the Bowery Hotel. Mr. William Tigertt from Freeman's checked in to say: Taavo did the design for the Gemma restaurant at the Bowery Hotel as the architect. We do not own it, or are not going to operate it. It will be run by the same chef/group that does the Maritime Hotel, Bowery Bar, and Waverly. It has no association with Freemans.We've been a bad blogger, and we're ready to bend over and take it. We promise to be good.

You would be hard pressed to have missed this week's shitstorm between Sir Chodorow and the Food Critic Establishment. But to us, a review of this type of establishment is worthless. These overpriced and overhyped Fusion/Theater/Rare Food establishments are not for city residents looking for a good meal. They are for the tourists and executives who are out for an evening and want to be wowed with fancy swords and overpriced beef. For proof, lets head to Miami, where an on-site tipster at the Food and Wine Expo reports \"people were tripping over themselves to go to the Kobe Club booth at the burger bash. People here love Choderow, as opposed to his nosedive in NYC.\" So rest easy JC, there is love for you out there. Just not from critics (the same who didn't like Freeman's, but more on that later).

Once there was a crappy Hollywood Video Store,Now there is a Duane Reade.Prehistoric Third Avenue sucks.The DR near Astor Place is officially open for business. We must not forget that every Duane Reade has a Chase Bank center inside, giving the East Village 3 Chase locations (Astor Tower, 3rd Avenue and 9th St, and Second Avenue Deli) in as many blocks. This is a serious challenge to Starbucks Square. Hopefully, the Green Goblets rise up to defeat their blue and red foe.

Robert De Niro's yet to open Downtown Hotel in Tribeca has finalized plans for its lobby restaurant and we have the scoop-du-jour. Ago, the LA and Miami Italian Hotspot, will be occupying the lobby space, and expect celebs and gawkers to make this one the big openings of 2007. The pairing makes perfect sense, since Bobby D and those other Tribeca heavyweights (literally) the Weinstein Brothers were chef Agostino Sciandri original partners when he jumped ship from legendary Brentwood trattoria Toscana to open the first Ago in West Hollywood a few years back. Our little birdy has also spilled the beans on at least part of the design. Apparently, the ceiling is made of 9 million wine corks. That's 9 with six zeroes worth of corkage that someone had to jam into the ceiling! Our job ain't looking half bad now.

The Bowery Hotel, Eric Goode and Sean MacPherson's latest addition to the Manhattan scene, is getting ready to open and open big. Even though the soft opening is reportedly still a few weeks away, we spotted some pseudo doormen/valets standing outside the Bowery entrance to this new \"boutique\" hotel. We also spotted what could be the hotel's first guest, the woman pictured here, get out of a cab and greet both valets with a big hug and smile. We hope that they have the same chipper attitude in 3 months when there are 600 people trying to get inside their second floor bar. It's Go Time!

Some interesting developments in the last few days regarding two of the more important bars to open in the last few months. First, it seems Death and Co. ran into some neighborhood opposition regarding its quasi-restaurant service. We've been to D and C a few times, and well, why we appreciate the name and above average cocktails, we are going to give it a pass. We have also seen Gold Bar go from impossible door to posing for pictures. We admit we haven't been yet, because well, we aren't that hip. But early reports to DBTH are troubling, with one birdy who has been reporting \"tons of models, cool space, and the best old-fashioned that $18 can buy.\" Seems about right, until our resident nightlife expert (yeah, we got one of those too!) saying \"They have not gotten any good pr and the opening was not as exclusive as I thought it should be, so they are trying to drum up some pr. Thing is, they usually go Page 6 or NY Mag, which makes me question what is going on if they go to Blogs.\" I guess they can bend with the best of them.Well, we like the blog PR route, since you know we are one. (And they love us). But, with Sacco-ville cooked, the irrelevant MeatPacking district, and the Lower East Side's Dunzo status, the state of NYC nightlife is in serious flux.

Walking down Lafayette, we came across this billboard by Neck Face, one of our favorite Street Artists. Remember Neck Face, the tag name you could rack your brain around for months and still not know what the hell a neck face was? He used to tag a lot of downtown spots, like this. We always wished we lived in a Neck Face building.Now we don't. Sigh. We cried little child tears when we saw who paid for the ad. A sneaker company. Bad Neck Face. Bad. We will never forgive you.

There was one little blog related nugget coming from the sparsely attended PR Panel. Our LB reports Restaurant PR guru Phil Baltz conceded that publicists must bend to blogger's requests. said you had to indulge them until you find out which ones would be around for the long haul. We all know who that means. Is there anything hotter than a publicist limbo contest to amuse bloggers? Of course not.

You would be hard pressed to have missed this week's shitstorm between Sir Chodorow and the Food Critic Establishment. But to us, a review of this type of establishment is worthless. These overpriced and overhyped Fusion/Theater/Rare Food establishments are not for city residents looking for a good meal. They are for the tourists and executives who are out for an evening and want to be wowed with fancy swords and overpriced beef. For proof, lets head to Miami, where an on-site tipster at the Food and Wine Expo reports \"people were tripping over themselves to go to the Kobe Club booth at the burger bash. People here love Choderow, as opposed to his nosedive in NYC.\" So rest easy JC, there is love for you out there. Just not from critics (the same who didn't like Freeman's, but more on that later).

Once there was a crappy Hollywood Video Store,Now there is a Duane Reade.Prehistoric Third Avenue sucks.The DR near Astor Place is officially open for business. We must not forget that every Duane Reade has a Chase Bank center inside, giving the East Village 3 Chase locations (Astor Tower, 3rd Avenue and 9th St, and Second Avenue Deli) in as many blocks. This is a serious challenge to Starbucks Square. Hopefully, the Green Goblets rise up to defeat their blue and red foe.

Robert De Niro's yet to open Downtown Hotel in Tribeca has finalized plans for its lobby restaurant and we have the scoop-du-jour. Ago, the LA and Miami Italian Hotspot, will be occupying the lobby space, and expect celebs and gawkers to make this one the big openings of 2007. The pairing makes perfect sense, since Bobby D and those other Tribeca heavyweights (literally) the Weinstein Brothers were chef Agostino Sciandri original partners when he jumped ship from legendary Brentwood trattoria Toscana to open the first Ago in West Hollywood a few years back. Our little birdy has also spilled the beans on at least part of the design. Apparently, the ceiling is made of 9 million wine corks. That's 9 with six zeroes worth of corkage that someone had to jam into the ceiling! Our job ain't looking half bad now.

The Bowery Hotel, Eric Goode and Sean MacPherson's latest addition to the Manhattan scene, is getting ready to open and open big. Even though the soft opening is reportedly still a few weeks away, we spotted some pseudo doormen/valets standing outside the Bowery entrance to this new \"boutique\" hotel. We also spotted what could be the hotel's first guest, the woman pictured here, get out of a cab and greet both valets with a big hug and smile. We hope that they have the same chipper attitude in 3 months when there are 600 people trying to get inside their second floor bar. It's Go Time!

Some interesting developments in the last few days regarding two of the more important bars to open in the last few months. First, it seems Death and Co. ran into some neighborhood opposition regarding its quasi-restaurant service. We've been to D and C a few times, and well, why we appreciate the name and above average cocktails, we are going to give it a pass. We have also seen Gold Bar go from impossible door to posing for pictures. We admit we haven't been yet, because well, we aren't that hip. But early reports to DBTH are troubling, with one birdy who has been reporting \"tons of models, cool space, and the best old-fashioned that $18 can buy.\" Seems about right, until our resident nightlife expert (yeah, we got one of those too!) saying \"They have not gotten any good pr and the opening was not as exclusive as I thought it should be, so they are trying to drum up some pr. Thing is, they usually go Page 6 or NY Mag, which makes me question what is going on if they go to Blogs.\" I guess they can bend with the best of them.Well, we like the blog PR route, since you know we are one. (And they love us). But, with Sacco-ville cooked, the irrelevant MeatPacking district, and the Lower East Side's Dunzo status, the state of NYC nightlife is in serious flux.

Walking down Lafayette, we came across this billboard by Neck Face, one of our favorite Street Artists. Remember Neck Face, the tag name you could rack your brain around for months and still not know what the hell a neck face was? He used to tag a lot of downtown spots, like this. We always wished we lived in a Neck Face building.Now we don't. Sigh. We cried little child tears when we saw who paid for the ad. A sneaker company. Bad Neck Face. Bad. We will never forgive you.

There was no major news announced at the event, no chefs went crazy in the SoBe Nightlife, unless you count \"Anthony Bourdain and Eric Ripert sightings at the Raleigh poolside.\" Umm, we don't. There was one little blog related nugget coming from the sparsely attended PR Panel. Our LB reports Restaurant PR guru Phil Baltz conceded that publicists must bend to blogger's requests. said you had to indulge them until you find out which ones would be around for the long haul. We all know who that means. Is there anything hotter than a publicist limbo contest to amuse bloggers? Of course not.

We admit, we're not perfect. And when we're bad, we deserve to be punished. In our excitement over the possibility of Freeman's being a part of our favorite new hotel, we got our facts mixed up. It seems Taavo and the crew will not be operating Gemma, the new spot at the Bowery Hotel. Mr. William Tigertt from Freeman's checked in to say: Taavo did the design for the Gemma restaurant at the Bowery Hotel as the architect. We do not own it, or are not going to operate it. It will be run by the same chef/group that does the Maritime Hotel, Bowery Bar, and Waverly. It has no association with Freemans.We've been a bad blogger, and we're ready to bend over and take it. We promise to be good.

The place is sweet, ranking up there with the other boutique powerhouses, both in NYC and globally. That's right, globally. But we have more than just praise. We have some juicy intel. Like the bar is open for business. And that the restaurant will be of the Italian variety and is named Gemma. And that the operator is none other than Taavo Somer of Freeman's. To top it all off, there will be a super stealth Japanese joint in the sub-level that is still a few months away. So let's take a deep breath and recap, shall we?1. The Bowery Hotel is sweet.2. The bar is open for cocktails.3. The restaurant is Italian and a co-production with Freeman's.4. Stealth Japanese joint coming soon.5. Oooh, how could we forget, their website launched too.Looking good, Billy Ray. Feeling good, Lewis.

For proof, lets head to Miami, where an on-site tipster at the Food and Wine Expo reports \"people were tripping over themselves to go to the Kobe Club booth at the burger bash. People here love Choderow, as opposed to his nosedive in NYC.\" So rest easy JC, there is love for you out there. Just not from critics (the same who didn't like Freeman's, but more on that later).

Once there was a crappy Hollywood Video Store,Now there is a Duane Reade.Prehistoric Third Avenue sucks.The DR near Astor Place is officially open for business. We must not forget that every Duane Reade has a Chase Bank center inside, giving the East Village 3 Chase locations (Astor Tower, 3rd Avenue and 9th St, and Second Avenue Deli) in as many blocks. This is a serious challenge to Starbucks Square. Hopefully, the Green Goblets rise up to defeat their blue and red foe.

Robert De Niro's yet to open Downtown Hotel in Tribeca has finalized plans for its lobby restaurant and we have the scoop-du-jour. Ago, the LA and Miami Italian Hotspot, will be occupying the lobby space, and expect celebs and gawkers to make this one the big openings of 2007. The pairing makes perfect sense, since Bobby D and those other Tribeca heavyweights (literally) the Weinstein Brothers were chef Agostino Sciandri original partners when he jumped ship from legendary Brentwood trattoria Toscana to open the first Ago in West Hollywood a few years back. Our little birdy has also spilled the beans on at least part of the design. Apparently, the ceiling is made of 9 million wine corks. That's 9 with six zeroes worth of corkage that someone had to jam into the ceiling! Our job ain't looking half bad now.

The Bowery Hotel, Eric Goode and Sean MacPherson's latest addition to the Manhattan scene, is getting ready to open and open big. Even though the soft opening is reportedly still a few weeks away, we spotted some pseudo doormen/valets standing outside the Bowery entrance to this new \"boutique\" hotel. We also spotted what could be the hotel's first guest, the woman pictured here, get out of a cab and greet both valets with a big hug and smile. We hope that they have the same chipper attitude in 3 months when there are 600 people trying to get inside their second floor bar. It's Go Time!
