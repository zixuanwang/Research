Tried the guava horn (90 cents); pastry was flaky, filling was gummy. From the sweets display at this Mexican bakery, I also picked up a Dulces Vero brand \"super chavo\" (.88 ounces; 75 cents), a mango-tamarind lollipop with chili powder. I expected a flavor akin to chili-spiced Thai tamarind candy; what I got was a lozenge-shaped lollipop literally dipped in chili powder. Quite a lot had fallen off inside the sealed packet, and not wanting to waste, I swirled my lollipop in the extra powder. Mistake; my lollipop was so hot I had to take it out of my mouth several times before I could make my way to the hard-candy center -- which, after all that, was just your generic red-lollipop flavor.

I've visited Doyers a few times since it changed ownership several years ago, and another 20 times or so when it was called Vietnam Restaurant. If you don't mind basement-level dining with an atmosphere to match, you can find a few fine dishes here that are absent from most other Vietnamese menus in town. Ask for grilled beef with \"la lot\" leaf ($5.50), a slightly crispier, more peppery alternative to the grape-leaf version. Sometimes, though, la lot leaves are simply not available; ditto with the Vietnamese crepes. Don't be discouraged: You can always count on the cool summer rolls, fried spring rolls, \"lemonade\" beef with pineapple sauce, salt-and-pepper squid, and caramel pork with black pepper. What's more, any visit may inspire you to discover a dish such as jellyfish, shrimp, and pork salad ($5.25) or grilled eel with lemon grass and a pepper-sauce dip (shown; $7.50).

This evening, five of us shared quite a little spread in the hopping front room. The back room, when I wandered by later, includes the sushi bar, the hardcore sushi diners, and a half-dozen sushi chefs who greeted me loudly when I entered. Our own meal was much less focused on fish. Sake-braised short ribs ($14) were nice; so was my longtime favorite nasu dengaku (grilled eggplant with miso; $8), though this was a much smaller half-eggplant than usual. Suba nomi risotto (\"buckwheat risotto with sauteed shrimp, peekytoe crab, and smoked trout butter\"; $18) was exceptional, and something I never would have thought to order on my own. Crab cakes ($11) were good. Of the sushi rolls, my favorite was the \"hot eel dice with sweet soy and sliced almonds\" ($10), but then, I almost always like eel dishes. As for other rolls, the spicy tuna ($9), lobster tempura ($12), and sesame crusted shrimp ($9) were all as advertised, but nothing bowled me over. To wash them down, I went for the Hitachino Nest White Ale ($8), which I enjoyed nearly as much as the Hitachino Nest Weizen I'd picked up a day or two before. We ordered quite a lot of sushi combos that arrived on a single platter — two orders of the 6 Bond nigiri ($26 each) and one order of the \"sextet\" ($28) — and despite the efforts of our sushi server, with many items we didn't know what was what. The 6 Bond nigiri are pairings such as toro and caviar, fluke and umi shiso, and salmon and kelp, but I'm not sure we knew that when we ordered, and most of these subtleties escaped me. The sextet consisted of octopus, marinated tuna, salmon tartare, \"live lobster,\" and a couple of other items I have no clue about. All nice nibbles, but without knowing just what I was eating, I felt at sea. We had desserts all around, and though the chololate meltdown and the Fuji apple crisp ($9 each) were fine, my lychee panna cotta with strawberry rhubarb compote and vanilla syrup ($8) was a terrific dessert to linger over, slice by little slice.

Picked up a lunch special of a rye log filled with flank steak, peppers, and onions, with a small escarole and white bean soup ($7.50). An apple (which I chose over an orange or cookie) was thrown in free, too. Filling, at least; the soup was a little better. The gala apple made a nice crisp dessert.

(This venue is closed, though according to a comment below, Mam Bi may still be doing business from another location.) I don't know the Korean for \"wholesale only,\" but Mam Bi had that sort of look: perhaps a dozen packages of different pastries up near the window, but no prices; bakery racks, but no bakers. I didn't step inside. (The photos, taken some two years later, displays the same countenance.) Back at the office, I told my co-worker Sari that I'd had a burger at Donovan's; she mentioned that she'd been shopping in Little Korea on 32nd St., and would I like a red bean pastry? Mam Bi — which, as it turns out, made those pastries — is no Minamoto Kitchoan, but I'm sure they do a good volume business. Mam Bi Bakery54-08 Roosevelt Ave. (54th-55th Sts.), Queens

As of Nov 2008, Mam Bi is closed with a 'For Sale' sign. I still see their goods being sold at various Korean outlets, so perhaps they've relocated.

The menus say \"cead mile failte,\" but the greeting at Donovan's was about 100,000 welcomes short. I'm sure they've been busier since Time Out named their burger the best in New York, but I get the feeling that brusque is the order of the day. The burger itself ($5.75) is one all-beef patty on a sesame-seed bun, nicely charred outside, medium rare inside. Not a \"five napkin\" burger, though the bun was saturated by the last few bites. It didn't immediately strike me as the city's No. 1 burger, but it was very, very good. Comes with big ol' handcut steak fries, on the softer side, but great after some healthy shakes of salt and pepper. To wash it down, I ordered a pint glass of iced tea ($2.50), which I sweetened considerably. It came with a bendy straw; I'm a sucker for little touches like that, and the mounted sailfish in the back room; nice that the fireplace was going, too.

(This venue is closed.) The Caribbean cuisine of the former Holidays has been made over at Comfort Food with the arrival of a few Southern dishes. Despite the new items, the menu isn't very large, and for Tuesday lunch the oxtail and the brown-sauce chicken weren't available. They did have the brown-sauce fish, though ($10), which I ordered at the back, adding a pineapple soda ($1.50) chosen from a half-empty refrigerator case. There's enough counter space on each side for perhaps 10 people to dine in — Comfort Food obviously does a lot of take-out and delivery business — so I plunked myself down, listened to a little soft R&B, and tried to make out the photos of celebrities and not-quite-celebrities. Some Caribbean artwork and other homey decorations mix in with a few mirrors, though they seem at odds with the track lighting. My tray arrived in a little while, bearing a good-sized plateful of food. The fish itself (some silver-skinned variety) was coated, rather than doused, in a mild, tomato-based sauce with a couple of red peppers. As I found when eating at Holidays, you can't be fussy about picking around bones here; these were worth sucking dry. My lunch was filled out by two slices of sweet potato, a small side of sour cabbage, and a healthy portion of rice and beans that was very moist, even in the absence of a pool of sauce. Applesauce carrot cake, the one dessert I was keen to try, also wasn't available today. Perhaps next time. Comfort Food333 West 57th St. (Eighth-Ninth Aves.)212-399-9549

(This venue is closed.) Despite smart surroundings, Océo didn't do much for me. Warm butternut squash soup had a lot going on — smoked bacon, baby Brussels sprouts, hazelnut oil — that didn't amount to much. Others at our table tried the baby arugula with roasted beets, blue cheese, and candied walnuts; this really didn't work together, either. Several of that number ordered the pan-roasted Scottish salmon with lentils and braised leeks; almost immediately they called out for salt, and some lemon. My pork loin was bland, the creamy grits were too creamy, and thanks to roasted lady apples, the green cabbage \"slaw\" was overly sweet. For dessert, my ginger crème brulee was fine, if small; others seemed satisfied with the \"old school\" chocolate milk shake.

A spinach pie to go ($2.50) was a little wider and much thicker than Jerusalem's, for 50 cents less (likely helped by Pita Palace's location, on a side street closer to Amsterdam than Broadway). In addition to spinach, this version was laced with much more onion; it also had an almost cinnamon-like sweetness that I like in many things, though not especially in my spinach pies. More phyllo would be nicer for texture's sake. Pita Palace(now doing business as Casablanca)203 West 103rd Sts. (Amsterdam Ave.-Broadway)212-222-3631

This otherwise ordinary store — from outside, it's even a little rundown — offers a huge selection (for a supermarket) of beers from around the world. It also boasts regular deals on inexpensive varieties, though I have yet to try anything at the likes of $1.99 a six-pack, \"a great deal at twice the price.\" One typical visit ended with three bottles in my bag. Saranac Hefeweizen (12 ounces; 99 cents), from Utica, New York, was unfiltered and cloudy; it had a flowery-lemony nose that the label describes as a \"slight banana and clove aroma.\" It's also marketed as a \"limited release,\" but it was nothing special. Victory Prima Pils (12 ounces; $1.49), from Downingtown, Pennsylvania, was a bright amber pilsner. Despite the big hop flower on the label, it was dry but smooth with almost-sweet undertones, and not bitter at all. On a lark I also bought the Bar Harbor Blueberry Ale (12 ounces; $1.49), from the Atlantic Brewing Co. of Bar Harbor and Portland, Maine. I figured this would be a joke, but the blueberry aroma that greeted me when I opened the bottle was surpassed by the tart taste and round flavor. I've since read that the brewery uses fresh blueberries, not fruit syrup; I've also seen it suggested that the Blueberry Ale can be blended into a \"black and blue\" with a stout or the brewery's own Coal Porter. Afterward I noticed that the \"best enjoyed by\" date was more than a year in the past; far as I could tell, it didn't hurt the taste, though it might explain some of Pioneer's prices. On numerous later occasions: Hitachino Nest Weizen (11 ounces; $3.79), from Naka-gun, Ibaraki, Japan. Cloudy, with little aroma, a smooth, round, fruity taste, and a lingering but pleasant aftertaste. Palma Louca (12 ounces, $1.39), from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. A light golden pilsner that's about 180 degrees away from Cervejarias Kaiser Brasil's better-known brand, Xingu Black Beer. Would probably quench the fire of spicy food without adding much flavor of its own. Singha (12 ounces, $1.39), from Bangkok, Thailand. A golden yellow lager with a light barley aroma and a full mouthfeel that's nicely balanced against its hoppiness. One of my old favorites, fine by itself in the evening, better on a hot day, best of all on a hot day with Thai, Cajun, or any other spicy food. Lindemans Cassis Lambic (12 fl. oz; $5.99), Vlezenbeek, Belgium. Welch's grape juice-colored; penetrating currant aroma (once I unwrapped, uncapped, and uncorked the bottle — no easy task); barely carbonated; round but somewhat fading mouthfeel. Goes well with the goat's mile Rocinante and the sheep's milk Manchego cheeses that I bought to pair up with guava paste. I appreciate this beer, but I don't believe I could ever drink more than one at a sitting. Yinpu black rice beer (12 fl. oz.; $2.99), Changchun, China. Deep reddish brown, sweet, vaguely fruity aroma and taste; not very carbonated; a lot like the Boylan's birch beer I had a couple of weeks ago. Long Trail Hibernator (12 fl. oz.; $1.59), Bridgewater Corners, Vermont.This \"winter ale flavored with honey\" has a honey color (\"ruby,\" the Long Trail website calls it) but an annoying syrupy aftertaste. Taller beer (16.9 fl. oz.; 59 cents), Nikolaev, Ukraine. Light amber lager with an alarmingly tall, lacy head whose look reminded me of sea foam on the beach as the tide recedes. Skunky-metallic off-taste. Appears to be sediment at the bottom of the bottle, and that's where I managed to leave it. Perhaps this is supposed to be a wheat beer; in the artwork on the label, it's hard to tell what amber grain is growing in the field. Magic Hat HI.P.A. (pronounced \"High P.A.?\") (12 fl. oz.; $1.49), Burlington, Vermont. Deep gold; as in the cask version, strong grassy aroma that kicks up through the sinuses; lingering hoppy aftertaste. Stoudt's Scarlet Lady Ale ESB (12 fl. oz.; $1.59), Adamstown, Pennsylvania. Caramel color, aroma, taste; not nearly enough hops for balance, let alone for a bitter. Tilburg's Dutch Brown Ale (12 fl. oz.; $1.59), Tilburg, Netherlands. Root-beer brown; roasted-caramel aroma; mouthfeel of thin cough medicine with slightly syrupy aftertaste. Rogue Mocha Porter (12 fl. oz.; $1.79), Newport, Oregon. Very dark brown, almost black, with cream-colored head; burnt coffee and caramel aromas; slightly acidic taste with a little nip at the tip of the tongue; somewhat bitter, lingering aftertaste. McEwan's Scotch Ale (12 fl. oz.; $1.99), Edinburgh. Dark brown; heady fruity-caramel aroma; smooth, slightly syrupy taste that lingers pleasantly. Brooklyn Pennant Ale '55 (six 12 fl. oz. bottles; $7.49), Utica, New York. Produced in commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the Brooklyn Dodgers' only World Series championship. Amber; vague fruity aroma; round, smooth flavor ultimately has little character. Brooklyn Lager (12 fl. oz.; $1.39). Amber; fruity aroma; lingering sour taste. Brooklyn Pilsner (12 fl. oz.; $1.39). Golden; bready aroma with a little old lemon; taste is more old hops. Brooklyn East India Pale Ale (12 fl. oz.; $1.39). Slightly paler amber; pungent bready aroma that continues through the finish. Brooklyn Brown Ale (12 fl. oz.; $1.39). Root beer brown with a head to match; sugary caramel aroma; taste is less sugary, more toasted. Brooklyn barleywine style Monster Ale (12 fl. oz.; $1.99). Dark amber; customary cloying-threatening aroma rises into the sinuses with every taste. For some reason, I think of the protective coloration of some poisonous caterpillars that warns away birds and other predators. Barleywine won't kill me, but I'll drink it sparingly. Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout (12 fl. oz.; $1.59). Black; burnt chocolate aroma. Taste is all at the front of the mouth; much less round than I'd expect from a stout. A little of that same aroma in the sinuses, too. Victory Storm King Imperial Stout (12 ounces; $1.79), Downingtown, Pennsylvania. Blackish brown; floral-caramel aroma; effervescent, almost woody taste gets a little syrupy toward the end of the bottle. Julius Echter hefe-weiss premium (16 fl. oz.; $2.49), Wurzburg, Germany. Murky golden with a white head; lemony fresh aroma; full, somewhat sour mouthfeel. Erdinger hefe-weizen (12 fl. oz.; $1.29), Erding, Germany. Cloudy amber; floral aroma with lemon-orange overtones; full mouthfeel that's bright for a hefe-weizen. Erdinger hefe-weizen dark (16.9 fl. oz.; $1.99). Root-beer brown with a tall cream-colored head; very faint aroma and taste of toasted malt; barely distinguishable as a hefe-weizen. Franziskaner hefe-weisse (16.9 fl. oz; $1.99), Munich. Cloudy amber with a short white head; fresh lemony aroma; taste that's concentrated toward the front of the mouth, but with a pleasant amount of sourness; banana notes, too. Schneider Weisse, the original (16.9 fl. oz; $2.99), Germany. Dark amber with a tall white head; bready aroma; flavor is surprisingly light and almost sweet, with overtones of spice, or perhaps cloves. Pinkus organic hefe-weizen (16.9 fl. oz.; $3.49), Germany. Slightly cloudy golden with a short white head; flowery-grassy aroma; the taste, all in the front of the mouth, goes sour after a few swallows. Efes pilsener (11.2 fl.oz.; 99 cents), Istanbul. Pale yellow; faint aroma and taste of old vegetables. Less offensive than it sounds. Long Trail Blackbeary Wheat (12 fl. oz.; $1.59), Vermont. Pale yellow; aroma and taste of not-quite-ripe blackberries disguises any indication of wheat. Doesn't work. Victory Hop Devil Ale (12 ounces; $1.59), from Downingtown, Pennsylvania. Ruddy amber; smooth but assertive hop aroma; round taste is slightly more bitter, but never suggests that it will go too far. Would be great with a burger; too bad Victory brews seem to be available in no restaurants and very few delis and markets. Sierra Nevada Summerfest beer (12 fl. oz.; $1.79), Chico, California. Straw-colored; fruity-hoppy aroma; taste is more sour than bitter. Lagunitas Pils (12 fl. oz.; $1.49), Petaluma, California. Amber; muted aroma of oranges that have lost most of their spice; taste has a little more bite, which lingers. Paulaner Premium Pils (12 fl. oz.; $1.59), Munich. Pale amber; flowery hoppy aroma, but a murky taste. Dinkel Acker Dark (12 fl. oz. bottle; $1.29), Munich. Dark caramel brown with patchy tan head; burnt caramel aroma; smooth, almost sweet, but somewhat insipid toasted-malt taste. Brooklyner Weisse Beer (12 fl. oz. bottle; $1.69). Cloudy amber with scanty white head; banana aroma with a hint of citrus; sour fruity taste with a slightly effervescent mouthfeel. Konig Ludwig Weiss royal Bavarian hefe-weizen (11.2 fl. oz. bottle; $1.59), Bavaria. Cloudy amber with a foamy white head; sour honey aroma; flavor adds banana undertones; mouthfeel is creamy to the point of murkiness. May not have been chilled enough before serving. Southhampton Secret Ale (12 fl. oz. bottle; $1.29), Southhampton, New York. Ruddy amber with a finger of pockmarked cream-colored head; faint spicy-fruity aroma; refreshing (though somewhat \"grainy\") toasted-malt taste. Otter Creek Pale Ale (12 fl. oz. bottle; $1.49), Middlebury, Vermont. Orange amber; piney-hoppy aroma perseveres in the taste which is almost astringent. Otter Creek Copper Ale (12 fl. oz. bottle; $1.49), Middlebury, Vermont. Amber with a cream-colored head; faintly grassy aroma; dry, lingering roasted-malt taste. Krait beer (330 ml.; 99 cents), Kielce, Poland. Yellow with nearly nonexistent head; sour, slightly metallic taste. Bard's Tale Beer Dragon's Gold Golden Sorghum Lager (12 fl. oz.; $1.49), Buffalo, New York. Huge mounds of white foamy head, enough to shave with if you're a morning drinker; beer itself is pale yellow. Perhaps that alien smell and taste is what one should expect from sorghum; I shivered once and poured it down the drain. Geary's Autumn Ale (12 fl. oz.; $1.59), Portland, Maine. Ruddy brown; fruity-hoppy aroma; smoky chocolate taste without too heavy a body. Coopers Sparkling Ale (12.7 fl. oz.; $1.89), Regency Park, Australia. Murky yellow-brown with little head despite constant effervescence; aromas of oranges and malt; smooth mouthfeel; flavor hits many interesting notes, ends a little sour — or is that vanilla? Bottle conditioned; has a little sediment. Coopers Dark Ale (12.7 fl. oz.; $1.89). Very dark brown, with a creamy head that caught the dark dribbles of sediment at the bottom. Aroma suggests roasted chocolate, perhaps nuts; taste is fainter and a little bitter; surprisingly lacking in body. Pete's Wicked Red Rush (12 fl. oz.; 79 cents), Eden, North Carolina. Deep orange-brown with a thick creamy head; aroma and taste reminiscent of malted cabbage. The Shipyard Pumpkinhead Ale (12 fl. oz.; $1.49), Portland, Maine. Golden, with tall, white, fast-disappearing head; smells of pumpkins gone bad, but flavor is relatively harmless supermarket pumpkin pie. Victory Festbier (12 fl. oz.; $1.59), Downingtown, Pennsylvania. Dark amber with a scanty head; clean, spicy orange aroma and taste; light hopping steps forward in the smooth finish. Weihenstephaner Korbinian (16.9 fl. oz; $1.99 ), Freising, Germany. Dark ruddy brown with a scanty head; vaguely chocolaty aroma has that sharp warning tang reminiscent of barleywine; smooth, somewhat thin taste. Geary's pale ale (12 fl. oz.; $1.59), Portland, Maine. Rich amber; faint aroma but prominent, lingering flavor of sharp, brassy hops.Hampshire special. Ruddy amber; flowery strawberry aroma is eventually subdued by that same hoppy flavor.Autumn ale. Ruddy brown with a fading tan head; fruity aroma that suggests lightly spiced oranges succumbs to a hoppy tongue-nipping taste.Winter ale. Amber with a cream-colored head; aroma actually conjures bananas; round flavor, milder on the hops, hearkens from some part of the citrus family.London style porter. Very dark brown with thick, creamy beige head; smoky aroma; even smokier flavor. Anchor Christmas Ale 2006 (12 fl. oz.; $1.99), San Francisco. Very dark brown with a frothy, fast-vanishing light brown head; considering the strong roasted-malt aroma, with notes of chocolate and caramel, very round flavor, and light on the tongue.

(This location is closed.) I hadn't visited this Afghan Kebab House since the new management moved the kitchen to the back and opened up the windows looking out on Broadway. Over dinner with my college friend Serena, her daughter Kyra, and two of Serena's friends, we had a great view of the blizzard that was winding down. The appetizers at the Kebab Houses, however tasty, always seem small; after a plate of the fried turnovers called bolanee pumpkin or the fried beef dumplings called sambossa ($3.50 each), you might feel as if the staff should circle around with another tray of hors d'oeuvres. The aushak ($3.50) — boiled, flat scallion dumplings in a minty yogurt, with a little ground beef on top — was no larger, though after a second bite, the spice built up much more than I remember. As sides for the table, we ordered spinach cooked with onion, tomatoes, and peppers as well as pumpkin, apparently cooked to the same recipe and spicier than in the bolanee ($3.50 each). Both were good. My lamb kofta kebab ($9.50) was dry and skimpy, though it still had that charcoal flavor that I like at the Kebab Houses. The chicken tandoori ($9.50) and spicy fish kebab ($11) were also tasty and offered larger servings. Entrees, preceded by a small salad, are accompanied by flatbread and rice. As a substitute for one of the rices, we were able to get a naringe: brown basmati rice with orange rind, pistachios, and pine nuts. Interesting, but the flavors never quite blended together. For a drink, I tried a dough ($2.50), which seemed to be the same minty yogurt as in the aushak. It's OK. Kyra and I were both disappointed that all the firnee (pudding) had disappeared at that afternoon's buffet; our table found baklava and a shredded-wheat katafi ($2.75 each) alright but a little dry. (Kyra and I made up for this later, outside, when we served each other a couple of wet facefuls during a snowfight.) Service was well-meaning but forgetful, not on par with Kebab House No. 1, on Ninth Ave. my favorite in this chain.

After a couple of hours wandering through MOMA itself, I ended my visit with a stop at the bar of The Modern, a full-service restaurant within the museum itself. The bar is actually in what's called the The Bar Room, a casual area that will soon be joined by a more formal dining room; I imagine that the reflective ceiling and the vaguely world-music soundtrack won't carry over into the main space. The full Bar Room menu is available at the bar itself, but after Café 2 and Terrace 5 I just nibbled at the free bowl of lightly spiced corn kernels (oversized, but not those Peruvian jumbos). My pint of Brooklyn Brewery's Brewmasters Reserve Porter ($7.60 plus tax) was smooth but a little thin, without much finish; even though I had just two kernels, the taste of the spice never quite left my mouth.

Three flights up from Café 2, as you might imagine, this smaller venue primarily offers desserts and drinks with an uptick in style — cloth napkin, mesh placemat, a flower at each table, waiter service — and in price. Everything is in tones of white, gray, or black, apart from the wall of windows overlooking the sculpture garden (which, in the dark, didn't give me too good a look). The bare walls, very high for such a confined area, made this a noisy little room. I ordered the hot chocolate with a couple of extras — whipped cream and house-made marshmallows — figuring that since I'd already be paying more than I'd like for hot chocolate, I might as well go $7.50 for \"the works.\" It took about 10 minutes to arrive, though I understood when I saw the presentation. \"This is vanilla, pistachio, coconut\" said my waitress, pointing out each of three sugarcube-sized pastels on a skewer. A mushroom-cap-like macaroon sat beside them. The mugful of hot chocolate itself was rich and not too sweet, and Terrace 5 didn't skimp on the whipped cream. I'm not really a marshmallow guy — the \"house-made\" lured me in — but for pairing off with hot chocolate, I think standard puffs would fare better than these delicate, airy little tastes. The coconut macaroon held its own, though that's not a flavor I would have chosen. I was disappointed to see that a 15 percent tip was automatically figured into my bill. Normally I'd leave 20 percent for table service; for Terrace 5 to add it automatically seemed a chintzy touch. Terrace 5 at MOMA11 West 53rd St. (Fifth-Sixth Aves.)(within the Museum of Modern Art)

Friday afternoons, the newly reopened Museum of Modern Art is free from 4:00 p.m. till it closes at 8:00, so I applied the $20 I saved toward a late lunch at this second-floor café that offers \"seasonal Roman fare.\" After ordering at the counter, the server handed me a number and invited me to choose a seat at any of the long cafeteria-style tables (the few other seating options were mostly spoken for). Shortly after I posted the number in its holder, my coffee arrived, accompanied by, well, modern-looking containers for milk and sweeteners, as well as a knife, fork, and (paper) napkin in a wire-mesh caddy. (All of these must be available in the museum shop, and I don't mean that slightingly.) This server -- very polite and well-trained, as were all the staffers I spoke with -- also pointed out the water and ice, a few steps away. Shortly thereafter, another server delivered my panino with prosciutto cotto, fontina, and rocket ($9). I would have ordered the lamb sandwich if it hadn't sold out to paying museum-goers, but I was very satisfied with my hot and crusty choice. (Prosciutto cotto, by the way, is cooked, as opposed to the more familiar aged but uncooked prosciutto crudo.) Came with a few tastes of what might have been sweet-and-sour sautéed cabbage with a raisin or two. Before I was halfway through the panino, a generous plate of roasted beets with clouds of sheep's milk ricotta ($6) landed before me. I hadn't ordered beets for a while, but I was reintroduced to them last month over dinner at The Spotted Pig. These had a nice bite without a trace of mushiness; a few strands of onion added tang. I can't say whether the coffee ($2) was an \"Italian roast,\" but it certainly was strong enough to face off against the prosciutto and the beets. Knowing that I'd soon be at the fifth-floor café was the only thing that held me back from a second coffee and dessert. On a later occasion, at 1:00 on a Saturday -- with my brother, Jeremy, and his friend Ron -- I landed the lamb sandwich with garlic and rosemary ($12) that was sold out on my previous visit. Hefty amount of meat, but too light on the garlic, and the cafeteria setting isn't conducive to custom orders. For that matter, the service fell a notch below the treatment on my first visit: our server didn't mention where we could help ourselves to water and ice, and no one came around to offer refills of our coffee.

(This location is closed.) For a group get-together over Boggle, I noshed on a little crispy squid with salt and spices ($3.50), which was crispy and salty enough but strangely lacking in the taste of squid. A good-sized helping of crispy glazed sweet potato ($2.85) wasn't crispy, which was just fine by me, since they were nicely glazed and sweet. The samosas ($2.85 for a small plateful) aren't bad. The kitchen didn't thoroughly mix the powder they blended into my mung bean shake (16 ounces; $3.85); they certainly weren't working only with fresh ingredients. At our next Boggle meeting here, perhaps I'll try something more in the tea category. On a later visit, I ordered the matcha sorbie ($2.95) — a cold green tea drink so frothy that there was almost nothing there.

Since my friend Mike and I had had a great meal here and at Teodora's Bleecker St. sibling Bianca, we were happy to visit once again with our friend Charlie, who was visiting for a few days from Cleveland. We sat up front, between the door and the small bar area; it's a little noisier there than in back or upstairs, but we had a nice view of the snow falling on 57th St. We split two appetizers. One, the fegatini de pollo ($10), \"chicken livers deglazed with balsamic vinegar,\" is a specialty of Emilia-Romagna, the region of Northern Italy where (I believe) the owner hails from; they were just as sweet and moist as at Bianca. We also ordered a sauté of mussels and clams ($10.50) that was fine, though I enjoy these dishes when there's more garlicky liquid to sop up with my bread. Charlie's entrée was the orata ($28), sea bream with swiss chard and potatoes, which Eric Asimov of The New York Times had found \"clearly weary\" in 2002. I was so taken by it on my original visit that I looked for orata on every seafood menu I saw, and Charlie was very happy with his choice, too. Mike was also happy with his straightforward spaghetti pomodoro ($13.50); rather than swimming in sauce, it came piled high though not dry, like a small haystack speckled with roasted tomatoes and basil. I ordered the lasagna ($15.50) — \"the traditional one from Emilia-Romagna\" — and was nearly blown away by the 20 thin layers of pasta held firmly together by creamy, rich Bolognese and béchamel sauces. This was as delicate (and yet filling) a lasagna as I'm ever likely to try, but I'll still look for it on the menu on a return visit to Via Emilia on Park Avenue South. Neither Mike nor Charlie had room for more than a forkful of my dessert, a very nice ricotta cheesecake. It wasn't the equal of the version at 'Cesca, but it left the standard New York-style cheesecake out in the cold. Teodora141 East 57th St. (Lexington-Third Aves.)212-826-7101

\"Uzbek\" narrows down Taam-Tov's cuisine too far. A number of items describe themselves as Middle Eastern or Israeli; golubtsy (stuffed cabbage) and stroganoff are Russian. That said, Rob and I stuck by and large with Uzbek offerings, beginning with manty ($5.99), steamed dumplings in a barely translucent wrapper, filled with beef and spices, and plov (an Uzbek rendering of \"pilaf\"; above; $5.99), laced with juicy if if somewhat stringy meat, as well as carrots and chick peas. We added two kebabs: my ground-lamb favorite, lula ($2.99), and sea bass ($5.49), which was a little skimpy. We also added an order of lepeshka ($1.99), a \"Bukharian homemade bread\" that I expected to be flattish, something like paratha. It turned out to be a full-size, circular, white-bread loaf, sliced into hunks; good, but probably better with soup or with juicier entrees. Nothing we tried was exceptional, but everything had a nice, homey taste that was matched by the demeanor of the servers (if not by the tight, functional dining area). On a later visit, in addition to the plov, I ordered a bowl of shurpa ($3.99), a beef soup fortified with potato, celery, chick peas, and carrots and decked with cilantro.

On another occasion, Boylan's orange soda (12 fl. oz.; 99 cents) had a sunny orange color.

Until recent years, your choices at Montreal's St. Viateur Bagel Shop were limited to \"white\" and \"black\" — that is, sesame and poppy. A few familiar varieties have elbowed their way into the lineup, but Montreal bagels remain obstinately smaller than their Manhattan counterparts, crispier (almost like a pretzel, my friend Monica complained, but fine by me), and densely covered in seeds. In New York, bagels from H&H (shown) come close to the St. Viateur version, though at somewhere north of a dollar each, they're about three times the price.

(Based on a visit when this restaurant was named Sabor Latino, one floor lower.) It's not a long climb to this cafeteria-style Ecuadorian, past several jewelry merchants (and now a BBQ joint) on the lower levels. Their version of a bandera ($7) was a platter of white rice with peas, crinkle-cut fries, tripe with potatoes, stewed lamb on the bone, and a little oniony salad with lettuce and tomatoes. The general texture was soggy: The tripe had no bite, the fries were soft, and the peas were mushy without quite qualifying as mushy peas. The lamb was good. Tropical brand manzana soda ($1) was too sweet, and it had an artificial-tasting apple flavor. El Rincon del Sabor 46 W. 47th St. (Fifth-Sixth Aves.), 4th floor212-840-0101

There's room enough for four diners at the one booth, especially if everyone orders the pljeskvica (\"our celebrated Bosnian burger\"; $6). This grilled, flattened patty -- a full eight inches across, cut in quarters for ease of handling, but just a quarter-inch thick -- comes loaded with lettuce, tomato, onion, mayo, and a mild, thick red pepper sauce, pressed between two toasted rounds of pita, equally wide and nearly as thick. (So thick, in fact, that technically, \"pita\" might not be the right name.) Given the thinness of the pressed-meat patty, \"medium rare\" would have had little meaning, and I was already prepared for a taste much like the cevapi -- grilled, skinless ground-meat sausages -- that I tried last year at Cevabdzinica Sarajevo. I wasn't disappointed, and I even needed to pause briefly, midway through my burger. As I was finishing up, a couple asked if they could sit down at the one table with their platefuls of cevapi, accompanied by the same trimmings plus yogurt, which they assembled into their own mini-sandwiches on those quartered pita rounds. I'll look forward to the DIY approach next time. Bosna Express791 Fairview Ave. (at Putnam Ave.), Queens718-497-7577

On a very snowy evening, most members of my sushi dining group bailed out, so only Chester and I were left to snag a small table in the back room. Looks like a West Village walk-down restaurant -- stylish, but not an atmosphere that matched all the hype I'd read. And no squid this evening, either, which meant no tiger's eye; a mixed sunomono (mixed seafood in vinegar; $9.50) was good, if small. I've always loved catching (if not cleaning) blue crabs at the Jersey shore, so a spicy blue crab roll with shiso ($8) and a piece of kani sashimi ($3.50) were at the top of my list, but they proved uninteresting. Good, again, but they didn't bring summers at the shore to mind. Hamaguri sashimi (littleneck clam; $2.25) was at least true to form. Two more-recent favorites of mine, kurage (jellyfish; $2.75) and baby anago (sea eel; $2.75) each showed off very fine flavor; the maguro (tuna; $3.25) was a very nice cut. We split two desserts: green tea crème brulee was pretty good; a sesame mousse with raspberry and ginger ice cream tried a little too hard. All in all, high-quality seafood and smallish portions at relatively high prices. Blue Ribbon Sushi199 Sullivan St. (Bleecker-Houston Sts.)212-343-0404

A \"homemade spinach knish\" ($2.50) had been sliced from the center of a roll before being packaged; no weight given, but seemed about 10-12 oz. Also seemed wrapped in phyllo dough, though that didn't make the list of ingredients: potatoes, spinach, salt, and pepper.

I also spotted a small display of KoJel \"jel desserts\" in many flavors, with equally colorful packages; the unsweetened diet KoJel is packaged entirely in black and white.

In a room with brick walls, it's no wonder that normal conversation was difficult, but that's no reason it should be too dark to see the food as well. A mozzarella, tomato, roasted pepper, and grilled portabello mushroom appetizer was fine, as was penne with tomato and basil (one of a pasta trio). Gnocchi with basil was too doughy; paparadelle with mascarpone was good. Pollo scarpariello -- chicken breast in a white wine and garlic sauce was good; sautéed veal in a mushroom au jus was just fine. Snapper marichiera, sautéed in white wine and tomatoes, was OK, but I'm not fond of tomatoes on my fish. A dessert trio of tiramisu, ricotta cheesecake, and chocolate mousse was also OK.

Sunday brunch on the Hudson this afternoon was intended to offer a respite from the poor service that Uncle Joe, Aunt Ann, Mom, and I had encountered at the Chart House in Dobbs Ferry, but Blu succeeded only in that regard. The restaurant overlooks not only the river but also a broken-down pier; our table also had a view into the kitchen, which could have been screened off with very little effort. Perhaps I was overreaching with a grilled shrimp cocktail with candied fennel and mache ($12) and a rare seared tuna nicoise salad ($17). The other orders at our table -- poached eggs with mushroom cream sauce and sautéed potatoes ($12) and buttermilk pancakes with blueberries, served with warm maple syrup and bacon -- seemed to go down well. But when half the items on the menu include seafood, I expected better. Blu100 River St.Hastings-on-Hudson, New York914-478-4481

I'd revisit a number of beers from the Brazen Head's Cask Ale Festival, especially the spicy Heavyweight Ginger Altbier. With food I'd give another go to the bitter Dark Star, the hoppy amber Inveralmond Thrappledouser, and the Blue Point Oak Aged Imperial Stout. The Magic Hat HI.P.A. (pronounced \"High P.A.?\") helped me understand what it means for a beer to be \"grassy\"; I'd order this again, too, if only to see if I could find some food to pair with it. For me, none of these will serve as a \"session beer,\" but I have a few more \"familiar faces\" I can look forward to seeing again.

Yuengling Lager (six 12 fl. oz. bottles; $4.99), Pottsville, Pennsylvania. A dark amber lager with the faintest of aromas and even less flavor. \"A good drinkin' beer,\" as Jimmy Breslin used to tout Piels. On numerous later occasions: Rheingold Beer (six 12 fl. oz. bottles; $4.99), New York. Murky golden color; aroma of corn (or some other vegetable. It's not bitter, not sweet, but it's not an extra-dry treat, either. I've always liked Necco wafers (1.5 oz roll; 65 cents) because the lemon and orange flavors (though certainly not the chalky texture) remind me of long-ago flavors of Junket. Those other Necco flavors: lime, cinnamon, wintergreen, licorice, chocolate, and clove. Brooklyn East India Pale Ale (six 12 fl. oz. bottles; $7.49). Medium amber; fruity, hoppy aroma; thin mouthfeel with an insistent, sour aftertaste. Presidente \"pilsener type beer\" (six 12 fl. oz. bottles; $7.39), Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. Brewed from a \"fine selection of malting barley, hops and corn grits.\" Pale yellow; aroma suggests nothing other than the thin, nondescript taste. Red Stripe Jamaican lager (six 12 fl. oz. bottles; $7.39), Kingston, Jamaica. Straw colored; smell and taste reminiscent of spoiled vegetables. I recall this beer tasting much, much better, and if only for sentimental reasons, I'll find occasion to give it another chance.

After a museums meetup at the Whitney, a dozen of us sallied east to this oversize Irish pub restaurant. The Wicked Wolf has the kind of character that comes with time (the hand dryers were manufactured in \"Phila 6, Pa.\"), although the staff also give themselves a little too much permission to be characters, too. An appetizer of smoked trout ($6.95) with onions, pickles, lemon, and (strangely) beans was delicate and delicious, though small enough that you'd think the fisherman would've thrown it back. My neighbor's stuffed clams were pretty good. My entrée of broiled sea bass (special; about $20) was flavorful and hearty; fries and string beans helped fill the plate.

A large cone of soft fries ($6) came with ketchup and mayonnaise. I also ordered the curry sauce, which sure tasted like the garlic aioli, despite the insistence of my server. Filling, nothing more.

The \"king of fruits\" has a sullied reputation among many people, including most of my friends, for an aroma that they find unpleasant. (You're read more than enough descriptions, I'm sure.) To me, durian brings to mind the aroma of overripe ricotta, though with a much milder taste. This evening, since I was noshing alone, two lobes (D24 cultivar; S $5) were more than enough. Apart from a half-dozen large, irregularly shaped seeds and a few fibers, the greenish-yellow fruit was so soft I could almost slurp it down. Sweet, with surprisingly little odor, though what there was, was insistent. Durian vendorGeylang St., Singapore

During a sunny lunchtime, this little Trinidad and Tobago restaurant seemed dimmer than it should have, despite the pastels and the flower prints; upbeat pop music covered for the sparse crowd. My entrée, a lunch special \"mini-lau\" ($8) wasn't very large; perhaps a full size pelau ($12) would have been more of a meal. A wad of creamy, spicy potato salad with carrots, peas, and corn was nice while it lasted; a slice of tomato over iceberg lettuce passed for a salad. The pelau itself offered nuggets of caramelized chicken that lent its color to the rice; mingling in were tidbits of green olive, carrot, and more meat, but not the typical pigeon peas. Less filling than it sounds like — and I had to pick out little bits of bone, too. To drink, a mauby ($3) — \"an extraction of the mauby bark infused with spices\" — was a dusty pink color with a faint fruity aroma, mildly spicy, and too astringent to be refreshing.

Bla tod sam rod (crispy whole fish with long beans and basil; $19) and neur yang nam tok (grilled skirt steak; $16) were pretty good.

For a group outing from the office — sadly, to say farewell our co-worker Frances as she heads off to another job — a downtown \"restaurant and biergarten\" seemed just the thing for a gal who's always liked Hallo Berlin. Quite a variety of drafts were hoisted around the table; for my part, the Gaffel Kolsch (0.3 liters; $4) was a little too light for still-cold weather; Jever Pilsener (0.5 liters; $6) was golden and adequately hoppy; the Schwelmer Bernstein (0.5 liters; $6) was a dark amber lager with toasted malt and other flavors that deserve less-divided attention. Though the sharable platters of cheese, cold cuts, and sausages with sauerkraut and mashed potatoes ($12 to $15 each) were perfectly fine, the multiple orders of \"bretzels with mustard served ovenfresh\" (three for $5) really hit the spot. Spicy mustard, or no spicy mustard? I switched back and forth as long as the bretzels lasted. Another time I'll give a go to baked camembert with lingonberry sauce ($9), or on an empty stomach, the \"schlachtplatte\" with a smoked pork chop, rib bacon, and smoked sausage, on a bed of sauerkraut and mashed potatoes ($18).

This Italian butcher and grocery has a well-stocked deli selection, too, and on another day I'll try one of their many (reputedly large) house sandwiches. Today I was shopping only for one item to set up side by side with the Thai \"coffee beverage\" I picked up the day before at Bangkok Center Grocery. Manhattan Special espresso coffee soda (10 fl. oz.; $1.99), Brooklyn, New York. \"Hand brewed from freshly roasted coffee beans,\" the first listed ingredient, followed by carbonated water and sugar. Very dark brown; fresh, dark-coffee aroma; very little carbonation; slight syrupy aftertaste. When I returned one evening, a half-hour before closing, the grill was already shut down, so an \"Italian hamburger,\" seasoned with fresh garlic and parsley, was not to be. Tomato, mozzarella, and fresh basil on ciabatta ($5) seemed desultory at first, and it wasn't too large, but before the counterman called it a night, he did me right by the basil, and a little vinaigrette, too.

A very health-conscious juice bar, to judge by the descriptions in their \"menu guide\"; everything is prepared from scratch from the fruits and vegetables in the large central display. My \"Hawaii-5-Oh!\" smoothie (24 fl. oz; $4.99) took its color primarily from strawberries and bananas; at times I thought I could taste the pineapple and coconut, too. Also sweetened with \"organic agave nectar,\" which Juice Generation asserts is lower in calories and enters your system more slowly than sugar, \"resulting in minimal increases to the blood sugar level.\" Perhaps a good idea, since the 24-ouncer is the only size smoothie they sell. On another occasion, a \"Ginger Zen\" smoothie (24 fl. oz.; $5.45) was a queer blend of soy milk mealiness and back-of-the-throat ginger bite.

(This venue is closed.) For a post-Wiffleball meal with my friends Ed, Max, and Gil, we sat at two sidewalk tables that tilted uptown with the sidewalk — so much so that I rested my Weihenstephaner pint ($5) on the more-reliable-looking table next to me. One Menupages reviewer used the metaphor of a \"slippery slope\" for both the service and the food; can't top that. My appetizer of catfish fingers with \"homemade,\" slightly crunchy tartar sauce ($7.95) were mildly spiced, with a texture on the firmer side of mozzarella sticks. The portion seemed a little small, but perhaps that's because everyone had a bite or two while we waited (and waited) for our entrees. Gil's giant blackened grilled pork chop ($13.95) was probably the holdup; we agreed it was just fine, though not as good as the \"grilled tropical salsa\" that topped it. Max was happy with his bacon cheeseburger ($10.95). My \"medium rare\" burger ($8.95), which arrived an even gray through and through, had the bland taste of ground hamburger before adding the \"helper.\" Very thin shoestring fries were no better. Ed's Greek salad ($9.95) went overboard on the lemon dressing, he said, adding that the olives clearly came from a can. Radio Perfecto1187 Amsterdam Ave.212-932-0808

Perhaps you visited too long ago, and there were not yet offering it, but this place makes the best grilled chicken ($4.50 half, or $8 whole) in Jersey City, or actually just about anywhere.  And the shish kabob is very solid, but doesn't reach the quality (or cost, to be fair) of the lamb at Beyti Kebab in Union City.

Also, I've tried all the malted fruit drinks they offer, and the pear flavor is by far the best.

Thanks for the word, Justin!

I did see the chicken, and in fact one or two customers mentioned how good it was, but I was in transit between Filipino joints on the West Side and more joints on Newark Ave., and I just didn't have room for extra food. I'll keep in on my list, though!

Good to know, too, that malted pear is the way to go; thanks again.

A plate of \"seafood-flavored noodles\" ($3.50) with ground beef, shrimp (well, one shrimp), scallions, and sliced egg, was blander than it looks. When I mentioned this to the gal at the counter (Rowena's, like most Filipino restaurants in Jersey City, serves cafeteria-style), she took pains to note that these weren't their (apparently well-regarded) pancit noodles, which wasn't ready at the time. She also treated me to a compact fried spring roll with hot and sweet dipping sauce (nice, if heavy on the wrapper) while another server freed up a skewer of four deep-fried dough balls (extraordinarily tough, gummy, and hard to chew, but only a buck). Rowena's is worth another try, though, for a second pass at the entrees. Rowena's Delight & Cake House444 West Side Ave. (Virginia-Ege Aves.), Jersey City201-435-1567

Samuel Adams Honey Porter (12 fl. oz.; $1.99), from Boston. Ruddy dark brown with a thick tan head; honey overtones, apparent amid the smoky malt aroma, come on stronger in the mouth and linger stickily. Post Road Pumpkin Ale (12 fl. oz.; $2.19), from the Brooklyn Brewery. Bright orange with a yellowed tan head; fresh pumpkin aroma and flavor mellowed with malt; round mouthfeel, though lacking finish. Blue Star wheat beer (12 fl. oz.; $1.99), from Mendocino, California. Murky but well-saturated orange-yellow with a thick white head, onto which I dribbled the yeast that clung to the bottle. Gently rounded malty aroma; flavor is somewhat citric; fuzzy mouthfeel. Magic Hat Jinx ale (12 fl. oz.; $1.99), from Burlington, Vermont. Orange-tinged brown with a tan head; woodsy-nutty aroma; toasty malt flavor is very round at the front, but doesn't quite finish. Strike that; headiness piles on toward the bottom of the mug. Baron's lager and Baron's Black Wattle Superior (12 fl. oz.; $1.99 each), from Australia. The lager is deep amber with a scant white head; it has a malty-orange aroma and a smooth, round, and malty flavor, but it lacks sufficient bite from the hops. Its brandmate, prepared with \"roasted barley and wheat, subtle hopping, [and] an infusion of Australian wattle seed,\" is orange-brown with a creamy parchment-colored head. Roasted malt aroma and flavor; creamy, slightly effervescent mouthfeel, though little finish. White stilton with blueberries or with lemon peel (each $5.99 per pound, on sale). Cream-colored; firm (though the lemon is somewhat crumbly); pleasantly tart aromas; blueberry tastes sour, while lemon comes on sweet. English shropshire blue cheese ($9.99 per pound). Orange-tan with prominent blue veins; semi-firm, smooth; aggressive, acrid aroma, biting taste. English stilton blue ($12.99 per pound). Cream-colored with prominent blue veins; crumbly; acrid blue-cheese aroma and taste. Blue d'auvergne ($14.99 per pound). Parchment-colored with prominent blue veins; semisoft and creamy; pungent, even a little earthy, with only the smallest acrid taste at the back of the mouth. Point Reyes blue cheese ($14.99 per pound). White with few visible hints of veining; sliceable, though will crumble given the chance; fresh creamy aroma with pungent undertones; slightly sour, uncomplicated taste. French Roquefort ($21.99 per pound). White with prominent blue veins; soft bordering on runny; pungent, almost floridly so. Couldn't manage more than a few nibbles; for a cheese this extravagant, I'd probably do better with a guide. West Side Market2840 Broadway (at 110th St.)(one of several locations)212-222-3367

Many items here seem determined to give no offense in any way at all; all I wanted was something cold to drink. Lemon ginger beer from The Ginger People (12 fl. oz.; $1.49) had the typical taste duo of sourness at the front of the mouth, bite at the back, but mellowed considerably.

(This post is based largely on visits to the Midtown location, which is closed.) For a large staff meal at the office, soup dumplings would not survive the trip, and dishes such as stir-fried sea eel would likely be too adventurous even for visiting editors looking for \"better Chinese food than we can get in Boston.\" Among the dishes I did order and that won special praise was an appetizer of \"green parrot with a red mouth\" (cold spinach with chili oil; top photo; $5.95). Favored entrées included braised beef fillets with chili sauce ($10.95), smoked tea duck ($15.95), Shanghai-style red cooking fish filet (middle photo; $15.95), sauteed Shanghai bok choy ($7.95), and from the \"Mao's home cooking\" section of the menu, cured pork with garlic shoots (bottom photo; $9.95). As cold leftovers, the vinegary character of the spinach and the smokiness of the duck were accentuated, and the fatty pork with garlic shoots made for an especially nice breakfast. My friend John often observed that if a restaurant proclaims skill in Chinese cuisine from more than one region — in Manhattan, that's generally Hunan, Canton, and Sichuan — then likely it does nothing well. The Grand Sichuan chain is a rare exception to that rule of thumb. Grand Sichuan International229 Ninth Ave. (at 24th St.)(one of several locations)212-352-0590

In addition to a small deli counter, P&W's — \"Brought to you by The Hungarian Pastry Shop right next door\" — offers all sorts of snack items arranged in an enticing jumble. If you sit at one of the few seats rather than take your order to the Hungarian, you can even have them toast you up a Pop-Tart. A beef tongue sandwich on soft rye with mustard ($5.95) was loaded with a goodly amount of tender meat, accompanied by a little cup of pinkish slaw and a pickle spear disconcertingly wrapped in saran. On another occasion, I may have enjoyed it even more on white. P&W's Sandwich Shop1030 Amsterdam Ave. (110th-111th-Sts.)212-222-2245

Another venue where packaged foods are your safest bet. For a late-night snack, I narrowly bypassed a large selection of Drake's and Hostess products for a coconut-flavored Fruit-a-Freeze \"super premium frozen fruit bar\" that was \"made with chunks of fruit\" (4 fl. oz.; $1.25). No surprise, the chunks were no longer apparent (perhaps you had to be there when they were making it), but it was still pretty nice, considering the long list of ingredients.

But confronted with pre-buttered, pre-salted popcorn and a broken soda machine, pie and coffee (16 fl. oz.; $2.50) is an easy choice, especially when the Little Pie Co. is the bakery. Had I known, perhaps I would have taken a pass on the \"French fries pizza\" and made a dinner out of pie.

The awning also reads \"organic grocery,\" but the small selection of fruits outside the door suggested that it might be an old awning; so did a \"hot buffet\" that was sparse and a little scary in the early evening. A can of Dr. Brown's black cherry soda (12 fl. oz.; 85 cents) seemed safe enough. It's certainly more of a \"session\" soda than Cel-Ray, and it reminded me how much I like dark-berry flavors. Perhaps it's time to pick up some seltzer and syrups for DIY soda experiments. Food VillageTenth Ave. between 57th and 58th Sts.

I think I found the right cart — that is, the one praised in The Chowhound's Guide to the New York Tristate Area. No name, but it had a worn, stand-up blackboard advertising \"Halal lunch\" offerings, and they make a fantastic chicken curry over rice (large; $4.50), with a little lettuce, tomato, and onion, plus squirts of hot sauce and white sauce. Must come back to try the lamb. Probably also a good place for a double — two layers of roti-like bread filled with chick peas and spicy sauce.

For a pre-Gang of Four bite to eat, I ordered the burger platter, medium rare, with fries ($8) and a Diet Coke (fountain pint; $2). Though I sat on the ground floor, toward the back, I didn't catch the arrival of my dinner — in the dumbwaiter, from the kitchen upstairs. Good, compact bar burger, charred outside and juicy inside, though if it were just a little less charred, the pickles and ketchup would have blended in better. Shoestring fries were too dry; soda was a little syrupy. As my friends Eric, Eric, and Gil arrived, I switched to a Harpoon Summer Beer (draft pint; $6) — \"a light-bodied, golden ale [sic] that is brewed in the Kolsch style,\" I later read on the Harpoon website — that made little impression.

Specialty sandwich No. 5, rare roast beef with tomato, romaine, and horseradish sauce on a Portuguese roll ($5.95) delivered on almost every count. The sauce was little more than a lubricant, but the rare meat was piled high, the lettuce and tomato was fine, and the roll was nice and crusty. Very good deal, especially for the neighborhood. Another lunchtime not long after, prosciutto, salami, and provolone on a Portuguese roll ($6.75) with romaine, tomato, and sundried tomato sauce, wasn't quite the match for the rare roast beef. It would have come much closer if the lettuce and tomato were included as advertised; discovered this, of course, only back at the office.

Though takeout here comes highly praised, a large part of the menu is devoted to burritos, which usually don't tempt me (even though Kitchen/Market goes so far as to distinguish between Los Angeles and San Francisco style).

Poking through the pop-lit section downstairs, I narrowly avoided buying the large box of Red Hots, only to give in to a Mike & Ike's movie pack (cherry, orange, lemon, lime, and strawberry; $1.99).

For a late afternoon dinner with my brother, Jeremy, and five of his friends, Bello was very loud, thanks to bare walls and a full pre-theater crowd. By and large, our group seemed happy with the meal, but my grilled swordfish (special; about $24) had little body, and I thought Jer's veal was dry under all that sauce.

A few good choices here for the Vietnamese Dining Out Meetup group, even if LaGuardia Grill serves \"Chinese, Szechuan, and Vietnamese cuisine\" (usually a sign that a restaurant does nothing well). Fried calamari ($5.95) was very good, though I missed that black-pepper dipping sauce. Spring rolls (two for $2.55) had an interesting, almost earthy taste, and summer rolls (six for $4.50), though run-of-the-mill in flavor, tucked a lettuce leaf just inside the wrapper to lend a greenish hue. Sugar cane shrimp ($4.75) wrapped artificial-tasting minced seafood around not-so-sweet canes; hot and sour soup (with chicken; $2.75) was neither. Many in the group liked the grilled pork chops (shown; $7.95), but the one I snagged wasn't thoroughly cooked. The usual bo luc lac (sautéed beef cubes; $10.95) was good as usual, as were Saigon-style noodles ($5.95). Our organizer, Minh, made an especially nice decision with the grilled whole red snapper ($13.95), replacing the familiar, tired sweet-and-sour presentation by ordering a tangy, just-this-side-of-spicy lemongrass sauce. Doesn't seem to be on the menu at many other Vietnamese restaurants, but worth asking for. LaGuardia Grill541 LaGuardia Place (Bleecker-West 3rd Sts.)212-477-0600

For a dessert-only lunch at the bar, I ordered three scoops of ice cream ($7.50) from Rosa Mexicano's third annual Festival de Helados: cilantro, mango brown butter, and coconut-guajillo chile. Cilantro had the color of green tea ice cream but the flavor of some fleshy aquatic plant; other than a pale yellow tone, the coconut scoop bore no trace of chile. Mango brown butter was runnier, almost like a caramel-colored and -flavored topping studded with small cubes of mango. This was my favorite for the first few spoonfuls, but I reserved a little coconut to clear the taste from my mouth. Rosa Mexicano61 Columbus Ave. (at 62nd St.)(one of several locations)212-753-7407

Twenty years ago Amsterdam was a neon-signed college hangout with decent bar food. Last year (perhaps) it remodeled itself into a stylish lounge that never seems to be serving more than a handful of people, so six of us had no difficulty scoring a table outside after Wiffleball. My tagliatelle fra diavolo ($19) — fresh pasta with mussels, clams, gulf shrimp, crab meat, and calamari in a tomato and white wine broth — was densely packed in a deep bowl; after a few minutes it had turned into a soggy, overcooked mass. Teammates tell me that burgers are OK; fries, very good. Amsterdam Restaurant and Tapas Lounge1207 Amsterdam Ave. (119th-120th Sts.)212-662-6330

On another occasion, the sopa de pata was again unavailable. Catfish soup (shown; $4) featured a few good-sized chunks of fish (but watch the bones) and lots of yucca in an opaque, piquant yellow broth. 106th St. Unnamed CartNortheast corner of 106th St. and Amsterdam Ave.

This get-together was a fun if chaotic attempt at experiencing a \"Chongqing hot pot.\" Eight or nine people (at each of two tables) was too many, and it was too hard for people to reach the hot pot and cook a piece at a time, so squid, lamb, pork intestines, clams, fish, bamboo shoots, spinach, mushrooms, tofu, and what-have-you were dumped in wholesale, often lowering the broth below a simmer. Grand Sichuan didn't help, either: Our very good crabmeat and pork soup dumplings (eight for $6.25) arrived halfway through the meal, and most of the vegetables arrived after the meat and seafood had largely disappeared. This chain does a lot of things right, but this evening our server was working too hard at selling us. I'll try again with a smaller group.

Kubel's crab pie ($17.95) — \"an old-fashioned pot pie\" with cole slaw and an indifferent baked potato — was adequately filled with shreds of crab but was nothing special otherwise. Mom and my brother, Jer, each did better the sweet, locally caught Barnegat Light sea scallops ($18.25) topped with seasoned bread crumbs and a \"lemon buerre blanc sauce\"; my cousin Jim enjoyed his \"jumbo shrimp stuffed with our crab imperial\" ($16.95). For dessert, I took our server's suggestion and ordered my peach cobbler ($5.25) a la mode; turned out very heavy on the vanilla ice cream, light on the cobbler.

(This venue is closed.) There's never a full house at The Embassy these days; in the window, only one of the two rotisseries was doing its work with the pollo al carbon. It's still lively enough for a lunchtime snack: a number of people seemed to be enjoying their big meal of the day, entertained by tunes on the jukebox and the Yankees game on the TV. My snack was a lighter meal than I intended; my \"avocado salad\" turned out to be no more than chunks of avocado, which I dressed with oil and salt. Just $1, though, not the listed $2.50, so perhaps there was some miscommunication. A batido de trigo (wheat shake) wasn't available today; avena, china, and leche (oats, orange juice, and milk; $3.50) was well-blended, yet it still had a slightly grainy taste.

After a rainstorm brought down the heat and humidity from insufferable to tolerable, I was willing to consider Picnic's Wednesday-only special of choucroute garnie (\"dressed sauerkraut\"; $22): potatoes, fatty ham, one thin beef Frankfurt sausage, and a couple of slices of some much thicker and paler sausage. All of this was nestled among sauerkraut cooked with caraway seeds and something on the rich and oily side, perhaps pork fat. Juniper berries are traditional, too, according to Jeffrey Steingarten; I may have overlooked them. You won't need an appetizer. Choucroute garnie is similar to a Slovak dish I still enjoy every so often at family get-togethers; usually kielbasa serves as the single meat, and mushrooms and prunes as the \"dressing.\" (Family lore has it that this dish is better, and more \"potent,\" on the second day, after it's sat out on the porch the night before.) Tonight I took my meal to go — Picnic seems to do a lot of takeaway business — but the cafe and the few seats outside are perfectly serviceable. Picnic2665 Broadway (101st-102nd Sts.)212-222-8222

I might have followed Sue's lead and ordered the well-stuffed oyster po' boy ($9.50); instead I chose a seafood salad ($15), which offered little from the sea except for squid, though beets and olives were welcome. Good to find Victory pilsner on tap (draft pint; $5). Fries, included with most entrees, were large and mushy. Bar Minnow444 9th St. (at Seventh Ave.), Brooklyn718-832-5500

This newly opened Guyanese bakery not far from Eastern Parkway also offers a nice spread at the steam table, an interesting selection of drinks in the refrigerator case, and plenty of seats, too. Currant rolls and coconut rolls are just $1 each; also available are those larger, Caribbean-style tamarind balls, as well as \"tennis rolls,\" which (I later learned) are famous for their sweet, lemony taste. Today I just picked up a sugar cake ($1), a not-too-sweet coconut macaroon more than three inches across and half as high.

Yeah, I'm just going through all your posts now and commenting away. 

Anyway, I don't know if you've made it back to Gruenbaum's but their black-and-whites are the best I've ever eaten. The frosting is creamy -- never waxy like it is in some places -- and the cookie is  moist, cakey and slightly lemony.

Another place that makes that style of black-and-white cookie is Leske's, in Bay Ridge:

I must confess, though, that not only do I have a weakness for all-white cookies, I actually prefer hard-shell to frosting.

I arrived early for lunch at this Garment District cafeteria; it's always seemed picked-over on earlier drop-bys when I arrived after 1:30. (Don't believe it's open for dinner.) On a sweltering day, the insalata angelotti (cold angel-hair pasta); $7.50) was a welcoming choice. Over a plateful of lettuce, carrots, cucumbers, and radishes, my server added a good-sized helping of pasta with \"chunks of parmigiano cheese and fresh-roasted vegetables\" — well, small chunks — topped by a tomato vinaigrette. Nice; I'll be back to try the squid salad, too, but not on a Monday. Café Veronica240 West 38th St. (Seventh-Eighth Aves.)212-764-4770

Good soda bread with raisins in the bread basket; a little sour, a little sweet. My Gaelic burger, medium rare ($8.95) loaded its bun with a half-pound of sirloin, plus cheddar, Irish bacon, and sautéed onions; big but not juicy enough, and I could've done without the gloppy orange cheese. Crisp steak fries smelled great, but large as they were, some had a mealy texture inside. D.J. Reynolds does have those little jelly-filled white mints, though. D.J.

This glassed-in corner restaurant glasses in its kitchen, too; from the right seat you can look out on Columbus Ave. shoppers and look in on the baker. My friend Dave and I shared a large appetizer of bhel poori ($5.95), a mix of puffed rice, onion, and tomato with cilantro and plenty of sweet-sour tamarind. My kerala pepper chicken ($15.95) made ample use of fresh-ground black peppercorns; on a previous occasion, I've also loved Mughlai's chicken xacutti (shah-Coo-tee), cooked in dry spices and coconut. I traded a helping of chicken for one of Dave's customary adrak ke panje ($23.95), five meaty, spice-and-yogurt-marinated, charcoal-broiled lamb chops.

Small storefront for a Berkeley-based artisanal chocolate maker. This afternoon, since I hadn't had a proper meal, I fought off the temptation of several different samples, but I gave in just enough to try a pair of bilberry-flavored \"pate de fruit\" (60 cents each). They're a shade larger and about twice as high as a Scrabble tile, speckled with granulated sugar, and more yielding to the bite than those half-circle jelly slices. Bilberries (according to my server's impromptu Googling) are related to blueberries and huckleberries, and in fact \"tart blueberries\" was my pleasant thought. On another occasion, raspberry and especially lemon (shown) were very tart, too. Scharffen Berger473 Amsterdam Ave. (82nd-83rd. Sts.)212-362-9734

Going by its looks, this turquoise-toned diner has had a makeover, but I can't be sure what work it had done. It was buzzing at lunch today, although at the counter a few solo diners lingered over their newspapers; that's probably a tough proposition once the Garment District lets out for the day, and the draft beer and mixed drinks start flowing. A pair of seared sea scallops over potato puree, with brown butter and mache (pictured; $6) might have been a little chewy, but the greens were lightly anointed with vinaigrette, there was just enough potato to mop up the butter, and the dish was clearly assembled with some care. The garlic in my fettucini with cockles (special; $9) arrived moments before my pasta, and it stayed with me; the noodles were a little overdone, too. Still, I'd give this place another go.

Walked over from the Bronx Zoo with my friends Bill and Nancy, and their friend Jen, to this cozy, casual space; it's a good middle ground between the clam bars and the pink-tablecloth joints. For appetizers, my first encounter with burrata (special; $14), with capers, caperberries, and cherry tomatoes, was moist, but no more; unless I was looking the other way, there weren't any pockets of cream inside the mozzarella. Halfway decent grilled calamari and gamberi over greens ($16); lovely, tender squid, but tasteless shrimp. For her \"entrée,\" Jen followed up with a zuppa di vongole e patata ($14), a large serving of clams and diced potatoes in a tomato broth that would have been better if it were lighter. Bill's vitello con spinaci ($21), which also laid prosciutto and melted mozzarella on the veal, blended its flavors well and wasn't nearly as heavy as it sounds. Even lighter were my agnolotti (special; $18), sweet ravioli with fig, prosciutto, and parmesan. Fortunately, Nancy's fusilli alla Pasquale ($18), with tomato, bocconcino, prosciutto, and basil, were within easy reach. Rather than the spirals I expected, these fusilli were slightly twisted, udon thick, and with just the right bite. Roberto's603 Crescent Ave., Bronx718-733-9503

I'd never had a dosa, and a meeting of the local Yahoo Foodies group seemed as good an occasion as any. This plain-looking restaurant focuses on South Indian food, so little surprise that bhel puri ($4.95) — a Gujarati appetizer of \"puffed rice, Indian noodles, and rice flour crisps topped with onion and sweet-and-sour sauce\" — paled in comparison with the freshly mixed version from Sukhadia. The samosas ($4.95 for two sizable turnovers) were an oddity; they arrived in a pool of thin yogurt. Good mango lassi ($3.95). For an entrée, a mysore masala dosai ($7.95) — a \"spiced crepe rolled with lightly spiced onion and potato\" — shaped up, surprisingly, as a giant triangle, more than 12 inches on each side, and crispy rather than soft. Two of the curved edges, folded underneath, were empty; broken off, they served to sop up coconut chutney and sambar, a lentil sauce. (As for the taste of mysore, the namesake spice of a large South Indian city that flavored the crepe itself, I don't know that I'd recognize it next time.) The onion and potato was pretty much a hash; filling, though. Madras Mahal104 Lexington Ave. (27th-28th Sts.)212-684-4010

It's just a new concept for the local chain Legal Seafoods, said my server; the recipes are all well-tried. My second pass of the day at Rhode Island Style calamari ($9.95) was overfried and dry; with garlic and (not so) hot peppers. Tamed for the airport crowd, most likely; I would have preferred to try the Logan version of Summer Shack's exemplary calamari, but \"open whenever there are flights\" doesn't apply to their kitchen. My flight was pushed back an hour, too, but at the end of a long day, a pint of Sam Adams ($4.95) was especially good. Legal's Test KitchenLogan Airport, Terminal A, Space 23, Boston617-568-1888

A Modern cannoli (top photo; $2), freshly filled on the spot with ricotta and dusted with sugar, seemed a shade smaller but slightly more elegant than a cannoli from Mike's Pastry (bottom photo; $2.50). The shell from Mike's was airier yet firmer; I preferred the thinner Modern shell even though, on the second bite, a partial collapse freed a puff of powdered sugar. A dark shirt and dark slacks, I should add, are usually much more forgiving during taste tests. I also liked that the Modern ricotta was moister, though no less dense, than Mike's version. A box of Mike's might travel better, but today, my cannolis weren't traveling more than a few feet outside the door. Modern Pastry257 Hanover St., Boston

Since Crab Beer, prepared especially for this seafood joint, was nothing more than root beer, I thought I'd cool off with Lobster Juice (12 fl. oz.; $1.50). This \"raspberry-lime\" soda has virtually no trace of lime, and as a raspberry soda, it's only average. Just a gimmick. Yankee Lobster Fish Market300 Northern Ave., Boston617-345-9799

The unmarked corner entrance to Lucky's leads to a clubby two-room bar with booths. For lunch with some folks from the office, Rhode Island Style calamari ($9) was spicy enough only if I want out of my way to spear a hot pepper; other versions — say, at Summer Shack — are a little greasier and spread the heat better.

In the early morning, I had this place almost to myself; a small sesame-seeded biscotti (25 cents) served as breakfast. I returned late afternoon to compare the cannoli ($2.50) with the Modern Pastry version (see that later post); I also picked up a pistachio torrone ($15 per pound), a nut-laden bar that wavered between nougat and a brittle. Letting a piece settle in my mouth for a moment softened it up just right. Mike's Pastry300 Hanover St., Boston617-742-3050

For brunch, the outdoor setting was fine; the $25 prix fixe was disappointing. Mini-muffins and the like in the bread basket didn't seem fresh. If those were really fava beans in the smoked salmon salad, they were the smallest I've ever seen, though the portion of fish was healthy enough. My serving of Eggs Park Avenue, on the other hand — \"scrambled eggs with smoked salmon, cream, and chives, with crispy breakfast potatoes\" — seemed skimpy.

(This venue is closed.) I didn't find anything I loved at dinner tonight. Perhaps my favorite appetizer was ca bam (shown; $6), seared monkfish with peanuts and basil served on toasted sesame rice crackers, but I've had better elsewhere. Of the entrées, duck with ginger sauce ($14) was pretty good. Dishes at Cyclo (See-cloh) tended to be overly sweet, and most of our group thought that the portions, especially for appetizers, were small. Cyclo203 First Ave. (12th-13th Sts.)212-673-3957

To discuss My Name Is Red by Orhan Pamuk, my book discussion group met for dinner at this small Turkish restaurant. The bare walls held the sound and made conversation a little difficult, but mainly because Taksim was filled with plenty of animated conversation; they seem to do a good delivery business, too. Of the appetizers we shared, I especially liked the simply dressed white bean salad, the excellent falafel, and the cacik (Jah-jik), the yogurt with cucumber, garlic, and mint that we scooped up with Taksim's pillowy warm bread. My lamb casserole ($10.50), with potatoes, green peppers, mushrooms, and a healthy pinch of dill, was on the gamy side — Kevin, who ordered the lamb shank, suggested mutton — the rice was dry, and it wasn't a huge helping; OK, though. The tartness of my Aroma brand visne nectari (sour cherry juice; 250 ml.; $1.50) accompanied it very well. A firm baked rice pudding ($4) was good; I would've liked even more of that slightly burned crust on top. Taksim1030 Second Ave. (54th-55th Sts.)212-421-3004

This small Thai-Malaysian restaurant nods toward Indonesia, too; they list gado-gado among the appetizers, and a stack of Indonesian newspapers nestled in the alcove up front. Slightly kitschy décor; '70s tunes on the sound system. Fried radish cake with egg, bean sprouts, and chives in dark soy sauce ($6) turned out not to be the chopped and scrambled mix called \"carrot cake\" in Singapore — think radish \"steak fries\" — but was still good Malaysian home cookin'. Though I passed today, they'll mix up a durian shake, too. Coco82-69 Broadway, Queens718-565-2030

Excellent variety, especially in seafood, as well as meats and baked goods. On a visit to the Chinatown branch, under the Manhattan Bridge, I picked I pack of pumpkin pancakes (150 g.; $1.99). They're a prepackaged, crunchy version of the griddle cakes from that cart on Canal St.; a little squashy, not too sweet. On another occasion, I gave a try to Mariza brand durian jam (350 g.; $2.99), from Indonesia. By smell and taste, I recognized the \"king of fruits,\" but only as a shadow of his true self.

Though Apholo makes its mark by sending \"balikbayan\" boxes (what my mom might call a Care Package) to and from the Philippines, they also stock their sari-sari (convenience store) with a small but select offering of incoming goods. Ludy's instant salabat, with lemon (160 g.; $1.09) is a Filipino ginger punch (sometimes, \"ginger tea\") that doesn't pack quite the wallop of the lemon ginger cider that May May was offering during Taste of Chinatown — though I'm sure you could mix it double-strength if you needed to air out the nasal passages. In addition to 6 oz. packets of polvoron, the shortbread-like toasted wheat cakes flavored with purple yam, pandan and coconut, or rice, Apholo also sells a variety pack (500 g.; $3.49) that includes melon and strawberry, flavors I haven't seen individually. The melon is especially nice, but like all these wheat cakes, it's very dry and crumbles easily to a powder. A glass of water makes a good chaser.

Aisles and aisles of snacks and canned goods here, but only a passable selection of fresh seafood and produce compared with many New York markets. Preserved waxberries (150 g.; $1.29), after I opened the bag, revealed themselves as bayberries by a different name, but the \"green ecology limitless magnificence\" offered by the \"Guangdong Farmer's Grange Food Industry Co. Ltd.\" delivered something that tasted a little more like fruit. That said, I still don't think these will ever be a favorite of mine. Black sesame \"cake\" (100 g.; 79 cents) is a Taiwanese confection that's closer to a brittle. Despite attempts at disguising itself with protective coloration (actually an unfortunate choice of background by your photographer), it turned out to be very dry, with a toasted flavor that seemed to have stayed in the toaster too long.

This simply decorated sibling to Teodora and Bianca also features dishes from the Emilia-Romagna region of Northern Italy. Freshly made tagliatelle with broccoli rabe and sausage, dressed with garlic and olive oil (special; $14) was quite pretty, and yet the bitterness of the broccoli rabe was a welcome companion to the egg noodles. Sausage and garlic blended in well, too. Crust on the bread was a little too giving, though it was well-pocketed within. Only real disappointment: The recital of specials failed to mention prices, and tonight mine came to much more than the usual fresh tagliatelle with cabbage, shrimps, and pecorino ($9.50).

At our Sunday-night get-togethers at my friend Tom's, our mid-evening dinner break likely as not involves takeout from this Spanish-Chinese eatery. Fast delivery, inoffensive, filling food, and few outright missteps are Flor De Mayo's chief virtues; I don't recall that I've ever set foot inside before tonight. An ocapa ($4.75) hides two fat slices of boiled potato under a grainy, peppery sauce — almost a paste — made of nuts, cheese, and \"huacatay,\" which may be a type of mint. Sliced egg puts in its usual appearance, too. The sauce comes on hot and heavy, especially if you use the lettuce underneath and the bread for the table to scoop up the remainder. For delivery on an earlier occasion, I ordered a papa rellena ($1.80), a bland but filling ground-beef-stuffed potato; arroz verde ($1.80), supposedly cilantro-flavored rice with carrots, peas, and (a little) corn; and tallarin verde ($5.25), thin spaghetti in a green sauce that didn't taste much like either basil or the spinach puree that would have given it color. At another get-together I tried the arroz con pollo Dominicano (chicken with rice, Dominican style; $7.50). (Tom, I should mention, composed the music for an award-winning documentary of Lucille Ball, and arroz con pollo, albeit Cuban style, was a favorite meal of Ricky Ricardo's.) Nice, bright, traffic-signal colors — green peas, yellow rice, one large slab of red pepper — but bland as all get-out without three or four packets of that hot Chinese yellow mustard.

My grocella paleta (currant popsicle; $1) might as well have been cherry, but it was good to see that it was manufactured by La Michoacana Paleteria, whose Sunset Park retail outlet apparently closed in the past year.

(This venue is closed.) This bright, spacious halal butcher and grocery may well stock a very good selection of meat from the subcontinent (and Malaysia, too!) in its two rows of top-loading freezers, but it offers a less-than-overwhelming array of snacks. A \"hot mixture\" from Wy-Nad Foods (400 g.; $2.99) — including roasted peanuts, banana chips, curry leaves, and chili powder in addition to those fried crispies — had a pleasant level of heat but was a little shy on the banana.

I squeezed into a booth here with my friends Bill and Nancy, and her cousin Valerie, about 6:00 on a Saturday. The Crab Shanty does a volume business in a number of regards; by the time we left, there was quite a wait. Lots of garlic bread and an assortment of vegetables arrived a moment after our menus. I couldn't even tell you what Bill and Nancy ordered, since Valerie and I were fully occupied with the \"banquet for crab lovers\" ($52.95). The softshell crabs, at left, were good; the nearby crabcakes, overfried and bready. A stuffed Dungeness crab, just visible at top right, was OK, but naturally I would have preferred picking my own meat from a whole crab; I couldn't say just what that crabshell was stuffed with. Two snow crabs yielded lots of leg meat and sizable chunks from the body, much of which I enjoyed for dinner the next evening. We hardly touched the six hardshell garlic crabs beneath them (let alone the french fries or those two half-cobs of corn) — when everyone else was leaning back, it was time to have our leftovers wrapped — but picked at home, the crabmeat I didn't scarf up immediately found its way into a pretty good pasta sauce.

For the first anniversary of Meetup's Vietnamese Food Dining Out Group, we got things going with grill-it-yourself platters of bo nuong vi (marinated thin-sliced beef; $16.95) and tom nuong vi (marinated shrimp; $16.95). I'm no expert at softening the rice papers in hot water, grilling the beef and shrimp evenly, and especially at wrapping them up with veggies and mint, but it's fun. Among the appetizers, cha gio (eight for $6.50), fried pork, crabmeat, and rice vermicelli spring rolls, were excellent; chao tom ($9.95), was so-so, but I'm not so fond of shaped shrimp paste, even with sugarcane. I was more disappointed in the bo luc lac ($7.95), which seemed heavier on red and green peppers than on the namesake beef cubes, and was entirely lacking in those curious speckled sesame taro chips. My sinh to sau rieng (durian shake; $3) was a little thin. Rau muong xao toi (water spinach with garlic; $7.50) was good, as were the family-style quartet ($23.95) of spicy and sour fish soup, fish in spicy sauce, \"garden vegetable\" in oyster sauce, and BBQ pork.

Perhaps anticipating a rush after tomorrow's New York Times review, Fatty Crab has already updated their menu: No more desserts, as of tonight. A couple of amiable waiters told me that the desserts took too long, in too crowded a kitchen, for too little customer appeal (although I'd love to know what a $6 ice kacang tastes like). After squeezing onto the banquette, I started with a dozen slices of green mango in a Jenga-style construction ($3), which were pleasantly tart on their own; a dish of chili, salt, and sugar added a minor variation. I returned to it as a palate cleanser, during and after my nasi lemak ($10): fall-off-the-bone curry chicken atop coconut-flavored rice, surrounded by fried peanuts, fresh and pickled vegetables, a little sambal ikan billis (fried anchovies with hot sauce), and a lovely poached egg. If that combo and the rock-and-roll soundtrack isn't lively enough for you, scoop out a little of Fatty Crab's belecan (fermented shrimp paste), a tabletop condiment that can hold its spoon at attention.

At tonight's tasting, none of the three offerings from In Pursuit of Tea intrigued me enough for a second cupful, though the second-flush Goomtee Estate Darjeeling — \"robust, muscat flavor,\" said the tasting notes — would be worth considering. The house chai, on the other hand, was worth another go-round. Of the complimentary bites from Bombay Talkie's menu, baigan bharta — pastry-wrapped smoked eggplant — was passingly fair. A papdi chat — a small puri pre-loaded with potatoes, chickpeas, and a tamarind-yogurt sauce — was predictably soggy; the crispy fish and lamb kebabs were tired.

Sauteed spinach ($6.95) was fine; sautéed greens with dried scallops ($12.95), were nicer, but not that much nicer.

If you were looking for a Thai restaurant with bookshelves in the back room, the West Village would be a likely place to start. For a group dinner, spice levels remained moderate to low — not by direct request — though a bowl of fiery sauce was ready for anyone who wanted that extra kick. Unfortunately, that sauce couldn't enliven a pale version of pla muok tod (fried calamari; $5.75); fried and crystal dumplings (about $4.50 each) were OK. In the entrees I enjoyed — including sweet basil eggplant ($7.25), young ginger chicken ($8.75), and turmeric beef ($8.95) — the flavors were underwhelming. Crispy whole fish Bangkok style (about $15) arrived awash in a cloying sauce, and its posture meant that freeing up fish flesh was a messier-than-normal chore.

'Cesca's tripe stewed in red wine with pancetta ($23), with carrots, onion, and garlic, lingered somewhere between tender and chewy, just as I remembered it from last year. The strong, winey taste kept asserting itself, but a spoonful from that bowl of barely grainy polenta let my taste buds catch a break. None of those juices went to waste; once the cheese-topped toast had disappeared, the crusty, sesame-seeded table bread soaked up the rest. For dessert, panna cotta with pomegranate sauce ($8) is from the same mold as the passion fruit version at Tom Valenti's nearby sister restaurant, Ouest — a creamy base topped by tart nectar — though I'd give the edge to passion fruit.

Early on a rainy evening, I was probably the first customer to take a seat in this cavernous space, but even after a walk around once the waitress took my order, I still wasn't sure. No matter; I soon settled in for the fresh tofu ($7) that EN prepares five times each night beginning at 6:00. (The bowlful shown here is one of several helpings from a larger container.) Offered at body temperature (or thereabouts), its silken texture is virtually unblemished by a flavor of its own; a little wari-joyu — a blend of soy sauce and fish broth — adds a salty touch. I'd come back another time to see what else EN has to offer, provided that the dining room isn't packed with a primetime crowd. EN Japanese Brasserie435 Hudson St. (at Leroy St.)212-647-7550

One of the few items missing from Pho Hoa's menu was banh mi, the Vietnamese hero available here in a half-dozen versions. Lu's also offers a shelf of sweet soupy desserts ($1.50 each), though unhelpfully all are labeled \"sugar, bean, coconut milk\"; this one is a tide pool of not readily identifiable ingredients plus two types of seaweed. I enjoyed it, but I also enjoy all the sights and smells of beachcombing. Lu's Sandwich Shop15 Beach St., Boston

Exceptional, extensive Vietnamese menu, even if today I encountered a little misstep in my order. I noted especially the bo la lot, here translated as \"grilled mint beef\"; lotus rootlet salad; the \"beef seven courses\" meal for two; small selections of lau (seafood fondue, or hot pot) and tom hum (lobster); 20 varieties of pho with a pictorial guide to the various meats; and the plum, soy, fish, and hot sauces that stood ready at every table. I intended to get the $6.50 lunch special, with rice, of muc rang tien muoi (pan-fried squid with spiced salt); I was billed $9.95 for what I was later told was the full dinner serving. Not perfect tenderness — I couldn't bite cleanly through — but very good, with a good amount of pepper salt, on a spicy salad. Pho Hoa17 Beach St., Boston(one of two locations)617-423-3934

For a last lunch before I caught my flight back to New York, I had my eye on the hot and sour trout salad with ginger and pineapple, until my waitress dismissed it as American-style. Instead I started with one of her recommendations, mee krop goong ($8.95), crispy noodles with shrimp and tofu, mixed with tamarind sauce and a touch of picked garlic. Needed a little help from the the tabletop hot sauce, but very good even without. The crispy skin on my bamee ped (lunch size; $7.95) set off moist, fatty, boneless duck meat; with egg noodles, sprouts, peanuts, and scallions. Tamarind Thai946 Normandy Dr., Miami Beach305-861-6222

When I arrived here two minutes after this little restaurant opened for dinner, at 6:00, it was already more than half-full of regulars. No one seemed to mind that Hy Vong's small staff was a little stretched — it was 20 minutes till a waiter took my order — perhaps because everyone knows they'll be well-fed. Indeed, after I ordered the dolphin with mango special ($16.95), I passed the time with a light soup (included), a soft summer roll (an apology for the delay?) and tastes of roasted duck with currant sauce as well as barbecued pork (courtesy of friendly diners on either side of me). My entrée, even if it was a little lacking in complexity, was more than pleasant (though another time I might lean toward the duck). Very good beer selection, too — and except for the lambics, they're all just $3. Hy Vong3458 S.W. 8th St., Miami305-446-3674

Though twice its size of a few years ago, this all-cash, no-reservations Italian is still best enjoyed very early or very late. Tonight's dinner started at 5:00 with a calamari appetizer ($8.95), exquisitely grilled — even tantalizingly charred in a few tiny spots — and nestling among field greens, all atop a bed of very fine-grained \"Sicilian couscous.\" (Gennaro's menu proclaims \"Italian Mediterranean cuisine\"; elsewhere I've seen it described as Tuscan.) Good crusty bread from Williamsburg's Sette Pane Bakery, though rewarmed just a little too long and arriving just a little late, tided me over till the arrival of my entree. The familiar doughiness of cavatelli (special; $14.95), with sweet sausage in a light tomato sauce, was balanced somewhat by the bite of broccoli rabe, but the flavors seemed to shuffle rather than step lightly. For dessert, tiramisu ($5.25) was so moist it might almost have passed for a freestanding pudding; rich froth on my cappuccino ($3), too. Gennaro665 Amsterdam Ave. (92nd-93rd Sts.)212-665-5348

(This venue is closed.) Simply decorated in blue and white, this serene walkdown dining room offers a terrific $20 prix fixe lunch. For starters, a basket of crusty bread rounds was joined by three dollops of hummus, one each flavored with garlic, olives, and sun-dried tomatoes. From the appetizers and salads — chilled roasted octopus enticed me, as did crispy sweetbreads — I eventually settled on grilled black mission figs wrapped in prosciutto, stuffed with kopanisti and gorgonzola cheeses, and tarted up with a reduction of red wine and balsamic vinegar. Though fascinated by the possibility of skate wing with an open savory baklava, cinnamon crème fraiche, and a sour cherry coulis, for my entrée I chose helopites, a (relatively) simple dish of wide egg noodles, kefaloteri cheese, and a ragout of rabbit and vegetables. Surprisingly but not overly sweet. The yogurt dessert was as firm as cream cheese; a scattering of fruit and spiced walnuts reminded me of granola. Call me a cretin, but I think I might prefer the yiaourti at Uncle Nick's. Be that as it may, dozens of dreamy possibilities await a return visit to Onera.

Long ago this was the site of a Hungarian restaurant, the Green Tree; the (Greek-owned) Hungarian Pastry Shop still offers a bottomless cup of coffee next door. For lunch today, from the Shanghai section of the menu I started with a cold appetizer of ox tongue and tripe ($6.25) in a spicy but not lip-numbing hot oil with scallions. The ox, a bit dry, mingled with just enough tripe to vary the texture. From the Sichuan side, shredded potatoes sautéed in vinegar ($8.95) were the lightest spuds you can imagine, with a crunchy texture like the sliced peppers that brightened them. Light but pleasant wash of vineger, enlivened by anise and black peppercorns. Columbia Cottage1034 Amsterdam Ave. (at 111th St.)212-662-1800

Bright little market with an interesting if not extensive stock, heavy on the staples. As with most African markets, the beverages case has entries from all over; Clover brand fresh ginger drink (350 ml.; $1) hails from Thailand. Another fine choice, quaffed in summer: Mirinda brand citrus (355 ml.; $1), a lightly carbonated, not-at-all-syrupy lemon soda you can also try in orange. A PepsiCo product, though betrayed nowhere by the primarily Arabic labeling. New Harlem Halal Meat Mini Market2132 Frederick Douglas Blvd. (115th-116th Sts.)646-698-5345

Some combos worked better than others, my friend Sue and I agreed after breakfast at this bright little restaurant. Ingredients did mingle well in my Cubana benedict ($6.50), poached eggs and chorizo over toasted Cuban bread with chipotle hollandaise sauce. However, a side of yuca with mojo ($3), boiled, with roast garlic, olive oil, lime, and parsley, left me craving the straightforward fried version (with or without chicharron). Good Cuban sandwich ($7.50), said Sue, and good maduros ($2), but the mango salsa that accompanied those sweet plaintains clashed in flavor as well as color. Coconut rice pudding with dried fruit (of some sort, as shown at bottom; $3.50) and café Cubano ($2.50 or so) were good. Cubana Cafe272 Smith St. (Degraw-Sackett Sts.), Brooklyn718-858-3980

In Annie Hall, growing up under a rollercoaster was just a sight gag; for Fuzhou Good Taste Grocery, doing business under the Manhattan Bridge is an everyday affair. Their most celebrated offering, a great value once you peel off the cellophane, is a soft mustard green sandwich ($1), though I prefer the bite of the mustard greens \"pancake\" at Bing. Good Taste's pork sandwich (also $1) is even more filling. A good way to spend your dessert dollar is on a pint of warm, fresh-scooped tofu with sweet syrup (about a pint; $1), shown here after a few spoonfuls have exposed its fluid character. Available even on a hot Sunday afternoon, last time I visited. Fuzhou Good Taste Grocery75 East Broadway(under the Manhattan Bridge)

(This venue is closed.) Despite the good reviews garnered by Mainland India (formerly Rangoli, and before that, Mitali West), for a while this evening I was the only customer. I can't believe the occasional rumble of the 1 train is that much of a bother; certainly I had no problem with my meal. My chicken chettinad ($13.45) bathed in a thick South Indian curry flavored with black pepper and tamarind; the moist rice that accompanied it was bedecked with cashews and peas. Khandahari naan ($3.95) was soft and thick but not doughy; only a taste revealed that the grainy golden filling was flavored with cherries as well as raisins. Though it's not overly sweet, I even savored one final piece rather than order dessert. Mainland India296 Bleecker St. (at Seventh Ave.)212-989-1367

(This location is closed.) The Soup Man's original Hell's Kitchen outlet has been shuttered for more than a year while he's worked on expanding his operation; this new location shares space with, of all things, a Crema Lita franchise. Perhaps $9 is a lot for a large cup of sausage gumbo; during my visit, one customer walked out grumbling about the prices, and the takeout packages are still filled out with some so-so bread and an apple. But even going by sight and smell, before you take a taste, you can tell the Soup Man doesn't skimp. I'd rather have one of these than a double order from that other soup place I went to yesterday.

This is the only place I've ever seen dried star fruit, though the containers seemed to have been sitting awhile. Instead I picked up a Dulceria Rodriguez raspadura tray (10 oz.; four rolls; $2.69) at the meat counter, where this brand of Dominican sweets often make their appearance. Don't be deceived by the seeming softness of the filling; each milk-and-sugar raspadura (\"scraping\") is so firm it's actually sewn into its leaf. It's a meltingly smooth but very sweet nibble that you could probably use in cooking, if you were so inclined. Met Foodmarkets1316 Amsterdam Ave. (near LaSalle)(one of many locations)212-662-1644

Octopus and potato — an unseemly combo, I thought, till I was introduced to it several years ago at Da Andrea, on Hudson St. — is served here with haricot vert and Yukon potatoes in a lemon dressing that's perhaps just a little too buttery. Sezz Medi certainly serves up plenty of octopus, though; seafood and spud go about 50-50. A grilled skirt steak (special; $22), medium rare with a nice char to it, was finished with \"salmoriglio\" sauce, a blend of parsley, pepper, garlic, lemon, olive oil, and oregano that would make it (I imagine) a cousin to chimichurri. More sauce would have been better, though. Shoestring fries and arugula salad were fine, no more. Sezz Medi1260 Amsterdam Ave. (at 122nd St.)212-932-2901

(This venue is closed.) Featuring the food of Trinidad and Tobago, this little restaurant was uncrowded for an early Saturday lunch, though West Indian music and a stream of takeout customers kept things lively. I passed on the roti and ordered my curry conch ($11) as a platter with rice and peas, plus plaintains and vegetables. The rice and peas were fairly moist and tasted of clove; the conch itself balanced very well between tender and chewy, with a gentle but insistent level of pepper. From the selection of sweets by the cashier, including tamarind balls and preserved mango, I chose a packet of Lat Chili brand stewed pommecythere (100 g.; about $1). When ripe and fresh, I understand, this native of the South Pacific is also known as the golden apple; in its stewed and seasoned guise, it had a hint of cherrylike flavor but tasted mainly of salt and chili.

Pla muk yank ($7.50), BBQ squid served here with tamarind sauce topped by crushed peanuts, has always been a favorite of mine. Thailand Restaurant (as this jury-duty standby is also known) used to grill what I thought of as a squid steak, a flattened tube and tail sliced into strips. The current serving is certainly smaller but just as tender. As for sliced steak, I found it in more typical form in yum nurr ($8.50), a salad seasoned with shallots, cucumbers, bell peppers, tomatos, lime juice, and chili — perhaps a new favorite. Disappointments: kai yud saie ($7.95), a bright yellow omelette stuffed with minced shrimp, chicken, tomato, onion, and bell pepper, was runny and bland; mee grob ($5.50), fried crispy rice noodles in sweet and sour sauce, and pad thai ($6) were nothing special.

The sushi counter up front isn't for me, and perhaps the selection of Japanese goods is sparing, but they co-exist comfortably with larger offerings of Chinese and Thai. Among them: haw offered in slices, rolls, \"globus,\" and \"hamburger.\" Por Kwan sour soup base mix (16 oz.; $1.75) also promises that you can make yourself a tamarind soft drink. One teaspoon of syrupy mix, three teaspoons sugar, and a glass of water, and you might think you were knocking back an instant iced tea. I'll keep playing with the proportions.

The upstairs room of this tiny restaurant brought \"Being John Malkovich\" to mind; after climbing a steep, cramped stairway, Jim and I found we couldn't stand upright. With Sue, Kathi, and Gil, we did manage to settle in around a table for five; complementary drinks managed to keep us comfortable during the hour our food took to arrive. (Perhaps delivery orders take precedence in this barren zone near the Brooklyn Museum.) Good curried goat platter (small; $8), including especially tender cabbage; the very sweet homemade lemonade ($2) had ginger overtones. Elsewhere at the table, stew chicken, jerk chicken, and oxtail platters were good; \"calypso shrimp\" was a little too coconutty for me; mac and cheese, perhaps steamed, was insubstantial; roti was doughy.

This Georgian takeout joint also has four seats at the window, if you're just passing through. That's where I had at my harcho ($3.99), a spicy and oily soup with tomato, onion, lots of cilantro, and two fatty hunks of lamb. A quarter-slab of lavash was indifferent; even when it came to soaking up soup; the harcho itself was appetizing but not filling. Judging by the continued flow of what seemed like regular customers, however, this might be a good place to provision a picnic on the beach.

Call it the Fairway to M&I's Zabar's. It's all on one level, and from outside it seemed quite full of specialty items and Saturday shoppers. At this point in the afternoon, since I didn't have the inclination to battle my way past the front door, I went to the streetside counter for a flaky but somewhat dry poppyseed puff (80 cents).

For a pre-movie lunch with friends, I ordered the lamb souvlaki ($10.50) in pita with lettuce, tomato, onion, and tsatsiki, that garlicky yogurt sauce. The meat was very lemony and didn't taste enough of lamb; the included shoestring fries, split 50/50 between regular and sweet potato, were OK. So was sakoulas ($5.25), a dessert of dense, tart yogurt topped with walnuts and a little honey. Niko's Mediterranean Grill & Bistro2161 Broadway (at 76th St.)212-873-7000

On the last day of \"choucroute month\" at Les Halles, I landed the choucroute de poisson (special; $23.50) and spoiled myself for the more typical briny kraut-and-potatoes version. Not that I'd ever send comfort food back to the kitchen, but sauerkraut smells different when it's slow-cooked in Riesling. (My one gripe: just one potato, and undercooked at that.) With seafood sausage, smoked salmon sausage, monkfish medallions, sea scallops, smoked herring, and a garnish of salmon caviar.

A sibling to Manhattan's Oceana and Molyvos, this is a classier version of a traditional diner; prices are bumped up accordingly. After eyeing the roast monkfish salad with field greens, faro, mushrooms, cider vinaigrette, and truffle essence ($15.95), I settled on the Italian burger, medium rare ($9.75). City Limits tops it with two slabs of housemade smoked mozzarella, which sealed in adequate helpings of grilled onions and pancetta. Fine, though it came off pre-fab. Fries were OK.

Retail shop and café for Knipschildt Chocolatier; if you like to watch (and have a measure of discipline), sit at the counter that faces onto the windowed kitchen. Today, I joined Mom and Jer at one of the tables up front (likely to be packed, come warm weather) for a nosh of two poached eggs on corncakes with sweet corn relish ($8.50). Liked it, even though the relish took \"sweet\" a little too much to heart; ditto with a meringue-covered grapefruit torte ($5). Much more satisfying was the torte de la maison ($5), which came with the personal plaudits of both our waitress and the pastry chef. No wonder: Provided you like both chocolate and hazelnut (and I imagine you do), you'll find it very light, considering how rich it is. Can be shared; I managed to surrender only a few bites. Despite the soup/salad/sandwich selections, I'm much more likely to return this winter for a cup of spiced hot chocolate by the counter in back, and in summer for a scoop of cilantro-lime sorbet.

Charming Italian, smaller and always a little busier than its neighbor Spazzio, but ultimately less special than Mom and I had heard. For the table, a small white bean salad was nice; bread was indifferent, except when sopping up the garlicky broth from Mom's cozze alla barese (sautéed mussels; $8.95). The mussels themselves were good, as mussels go; funghi ripieni (mushrooms stuffed with crab meat; special; $9) were a little bready. Branzino roasted with extra virgin olive oil and lemon (special; $21) was excellent: tender, delicate, and lemony but not oily. Roasted potatoes were very good, too; sautéed spinach was just OK. Mom's braised lamb shank over fettucine (special; $20) was falling-off-the-bone tender; by comparison, the pasta was a little too chewy. For dessert, my tartufo ($6) was good; Mom's zuppa Inglese ($6) edged it out. Coffee ($1.50) was fine, too. Caffe Silvium371 Shippan Ave., Stamford, Connecticut203-324-1651

Joined my friend Phil for a long-overdue dinner at this Park Slope restaurant that matches flea-market décor, catch-as-catch-can tableware, and top-notch Venetian cuisine. My favorite dish of the evening may have been my starter, trippa alla Toscana, a hearty tripe stew with prominent white-wine notes. (Because it's a favorite, tripe has also proved difficult to photograph on repeated occasions, this one included.) A close second, though, were casunsiei, ravioli filled with ricotta and lovely fresh beets in a pool of brown butter and poppyseeds. Although I've always been fond of liver, my calf liver alla Veneziana entree did little for me; braised rabbit, baked orata, and grilled chicken will have to await return visits.

Décor here is appropriate to a taxi-driver hangout; food is straightforward. Tassot griot (fried goat; $9) was preceded by an iceberg-cucumber-tomato salad, then accompanied by fried plantains, a sizable plate of rice and beans, and a cupful of tomatoey sauce to wet them down. Even better for livening up the rice and beans were a few big spoonfuls of spicy cabbage slaw, a standard condiment at every table. As for the earthy, dry-fried goat, it was best all by itself, though a ring of raw onion made a nice match, too. Le Soleil877 Tenth Ave. (57th-58th Sts.)212-581-6059

A little flavored oil, a dusting of pepper, a tad of fontina, and springy, firm, thick-cut focaccia transform \"egg in the hole\" into this tiny restaurant's famous truffled egg toast ($7). My dining companion and I also split a four-panini sampler ($10) — cacciatorini, goat cheese, and black olive pesto was my favorite — and I helped myself to a nice anchovy bruschetta (special; $3) that smacked of the sea without tasting fishy. But even on its own (or, maybe, over morning coffee), the truffled egg toast is reason enough to go back to the well. 'ino21 Bedford St. (Houston-Downing Sts.)212-989-5769

Since the fireplace in the large back room was unlit this evening, I sat up front, where a couple of regulars added their own commentary to the day's soccer highlights. I started off with mamaliga cu brinza si smintina ($3.99), a soft, slightly grainy yellow polenta smothered with very salty grated cheese and dressed with chilled dollops of sour cream. It's a very heavy appetizer, best split four ways, or more. I wasn't expecting a platter, let alone such a pretty spread, when I ordered ostropel de pui ($8.99), chicken stew with red garlic sauce. The chicken is very tender; the sauce, mild, though I expect the kitchen would accommodate special requests from garlic lovers. For a side, my friendly server suggested mashed potatoes to sop up the sauce; as for the sliced white bread on the table, I gave it a pass. For a group lunch on another occasion, we ordered an appetizer platter of drob, an Eastertime meat loaf dotted with greens, lamb liver and heart (bland, to my taste); fasole batuta, a bean spread enlivened with fried onions; salata de vinete, an eggplant salad with raw, chopped onions; and cirnaciori oltenesti, crisp pork sausages also offered as a (surely popular) entrée. My entrée that day was another Easter specialty, a hefty hunk of lamb ($12) braised in a savory sauce, perhaps with red wine. Typically for Romanian Garden, it was straightforward, even workmanlike, but also very gratifying. Romanian Garden46-04 Skillman Ave., Sunnyside, Queens718-786-7894

Yu sheng (special; $18) — a salad of sliced raw fish; fresh, pickled, and candied fruits and vegetables; sesame seeds; and other colorful odds and ends, all in a light dressing — is a Chinese New Year tradition, tossed by everyone at the table amid wishes of abundance and prosperity. Too sweet for me, salmon notwithstanding. Among the Malaysian dishes, steamed skate ($14) was very meaty, in a thick belacan (fermented shrimp) sauce; the classic wide noodles called chow kueh teow ($6) were OK after the addition of considerable chili; a pandan chicken appetizer ($6) was tepid and lacked pandan flavor; the syrup on the ABC (a.k.a. ice kacang; $3) was too cherrylike.

The batter on the fried squid, scallops, and shrimp, so sparing that it was often translucent, only called greater attention to the freshness of the seafood; flavorings included black bean, purple onion, red pepper, celery, and garlic.

This jardinière sandwich on toasted multigrain bread ($12.75), with roasted eggplant, portobella mushrooms, fennel, piquillo peppers, and gruyère, is a sophisticated, healthy, if pricey take on grilled cheese (which in truth plays only a minor role). A version to go from the takeaway counter is about three bucks less, though possibly absent the salad and cornichons. If you wander by the counter, however, salad won't be the first or last thing on your mind. French for \"cork,\" at heart the namesake bouchon ($1.75) is a moist, almost molten cake of Vahlrona chocolate, stubbier but broader than what you'd find in a bottle (and too fast-moving for my camera). This nutter butter ($2.75), like me, may never make its way into Per Se, Bouchon Bakery's hyper-refined relative one floor up, but I was more than happy to put the squeeze on this pair of oats-and-peanut cookies sandwiched around peanut cream.

Joined two friends upstairs in this compact tri-level restaurant that might well be taller than it is wide or deep. Also standing tall: a very good al dente rendition of BBQ squid in ginger sauce ($7). Tako su ($6.50), sliced octopus in vinegar sauce, was also nice; nasu age ($4.50), broiled eggplant, was a tad undersized in a (less than) special sauce. Accompanied by a cold sake, the unfiltered Shirakawago Sasanigori (300 ml.; $14.50), which had a slight astringency not unlike unripe persimmon. The eight-piece \"smoke roll\" ($12.50) — shrimp, black mushroom, avocado, (bonito?) flake, cream cheese, and smoked salmon — though very filling, simply tried too hard. The five-piece roll on top, however, I'd order again in a shot; lettuce, cucumber, mayonnaise, and that selfsame \"flake\" do right by deep-fried oyster ($7.50).

Chicken soon ($9.95) — minced with vegetables, topped with pine nuts, and ready to be spooned into lettuce leaves — was bland, plum sauce aside. The batter on triple treasure in peppery salt (shown; $14.95) was too thick, and in some cases it adhered poorly to the squid, shrimp, and scallops. I much prefer the baked trio at Great N.Y.

After my day at JazzFest, the crawfish boil (offered here Friday through Sunday) found other takers to hunker down at the half-dozen tables inside. Mello Yello (12 fl. oz.; $1) was a mildly carbonated, slightly syrupy citrus soda that I'm sure I must have tried, years back. On another occasion, at the window on the side street, a toasted coconut sno-ball (small; $1.75) was fine-grained, veering toward slushy. Lots of flavor; Royal Grocery layers its syrup the way better moviehouses add butter to popcorn. Royal Grocery & Deli801 Royal St., New Orleans504-523-4716

OMG, your page ROCKS. I am making my first pilgrimage to Jazzfest this weekend, and your photos were just what I needed to pick my list of must-eats! There's a guy on Flickr who calls his food photos \"food porn.\" And as Martha would say, that's a Good Thing.

Crossing the boulevard was less a matter of watching for traffic than keeping a weather eye on windblown debris. The breeze was steady, often stiff — just right for flying those sturdy plastic bird kites, if not for the dreary atmosphere. During the power outage, Viet-My was making do with daylight. \"It rains, the power goes out,\" said the lady behind the counter. \"Too much wind, the power goes out, maybe five, six hours at a time. It's like living in a Third World country.\" Lucky for me, one of this morning's batch of Vietnamese doughnuts (35 cents) still lingered by the register; it was sesame-dotted, coconut-filled, and pleasantly oily.

The generator by the supermarket door lighted bare bulbs strung from the ceiling; other nearby stores made do with daylight through doors and windows. Well-stocked store, as best I could make out, including an extensive meat counter, where the butcher had recently finished off a Wonderfarm brand artichoke drink (330 ml.; 75 cents). Not much flavor to it, I found out for myself. Que Huong Supermarket4661 Alcee Fortier Blvd., New Orleans

Of the specialty pizzas from My Place, my first choice was the white casino (large; $17), with baby clams, hickory smoked bacon, peppers, and garlic, but the clams weren't nearly as prominent as the large but undermelted gobs of ricotta, and other flavors didn't come together. This veggie works pie (medium; $15), which arrayed red roasted peppers, green peppers, fresh mushrooms, fresh basil, onions, garlic, broccoli, spinach, and eggplant, is a superior selection.

Crowded restaurant that handles attention well. La moelle (bone marrow; $8.75) oozed decadently across thick-sliced grilled bread; I could quibble that the salt wasn't coarse enough and the parsley, too stinting, but it left me with a glow nonetheless. Grilled truite au Riesling ($19.50), with buttered spinach, was light and flaky, well-paired with a sauce flavored by the namesake grape. A gateau au fromage blanc (Alsatian-style cheesecake; $8) was topped by a lemon zest confit and surrounded by a generous moat of tart raspberry coulis. On a return visit a year later, the trout was still very good, as were the choucroute with fish and the cassoulet, but the presentation was artless — verging on clunky, in the case of the trout.

For a brunch outing, the pho dac biet ($4.95) filled this \"combination special big bowl\" with rice noodles and \"six differences\" of beef in beef soup. Brisket, eye of round, and frank (I presume \"flank\") are familiar enough; omosa (tripe), navel (cartilage from you-know-where) and tendon each add their version of chewy or gelatinous texture, but less pleasantly and less substantively than a good Italian tripe stew. Next time I'll likely limit myself to the more traditional cuts. We also split a plate of banh cuon cha lua ($5.50), an array of steamed glutinous rice crepes containing minced mushroom, served with Vietnamese ham, toasted garlic, plus sprouts and other assorted veggies.

This exemplary pie, half margherita and half with sweet sausage ($19.45), had a lightly charred, thin crust that was both firm and chewy. This evening it was a fine platform for fresh mozzarella, imported Italian tomatoes, and plentiful disks of sausage. Two plain slices traveled home, but following a night in the fridge, they didn't fare as well as their doughier cousins.

Tonight my friend Robert and I were fortunate enough to score the two seats closest to the serving station, where we had an eye on the open kitchen and the ear of the well-informed waitstaff. Our tapas selection led off with pumpkin croquettes ($9), fried spheroids the size of a pingpong ball and not much heavier, even though filled with goat cheese, and an excellent if not exceptional duck with olives and salsify ($16). Other winners off the grill: dorada with garlic potatoes ($15), octopus ($13), and asparagus ($8). Desserts — a manchego tasting ($7) with not quite enough quince, and a crema catalana (a.k.a. brulee; $7) with a oh-so-precious accompaniment of bay leaf buñuelos — prompted us to repair next door to Bar Jamón for a more satisfying finale to an otherwise fine meal.Casa Mono52 Irving Place (at 17th St.)212-253-2773

A concise, dependable menu is essential to any bistro's business plan; Alias (uh-Lie-us) accentuates its bill of fare with intriguing combinations that are equally well-executed without being cute. My two dining companions, seated at their regular table, recommended three aquatic appetizers ($9 each); my favorite was the simplest, fried softshell crab that smacked of apricot sauce and kim chee.The most spirited competition was for slices of duck leg confit (shown), with caramelized onion, goat cheese, and spiced plum jam on focaccia. In other company, garlic butter shrimp and avocado, with blood orange, pine nuts, and cayenne under a dense tangle of pea shoots, might be the standout; the pairing of chewy, meaty shrimp and crisp pea shoots was particularly engaging.Entrees and sides were less glamorous but just as winning. Grilled pork loin and bacon mashed potatoes in an onion jus ($19) topped the charts, but you wouldn't do poorly with the juicy, garlic-roasted hanger steak ($20) or the half-rack of St. Louis-style ribs ($17) slathered in a sweet BBQ sauce. Of the sides ($5 each), mac 'n' cheese and shredded kale were exceptional; fried crushed potatoes were good.Even bolstered by a double espresso each, the three of us had energy for just two desserts. A glassful of Chocolate Guinness Goodness ($6) had a heady look and a semisweet (but possibly beer-free) flavor; a rhubard puff pastry was even more restrained with the sugar.Next time, I'm getting a duck leg of my own.Alias76 Clinton St. (at Rivington St.)212-505-5011

Matouk's hot chow (375 ml.; $3.59), from Trinidad and Tobago, may soon find a home on a hot dog. Adnan Fish Market147-11 Hillside Ave., Jamaica, Queens718-297-7146

\"That's a tough choice,\" said my waiter, when I asked about his preference between two house-made pastas, the tagliatelle with braised lamb ragu and the cavatelli with Faicco's hot sausage and browned sage butter. We eventually settled on the tagliatelle ($15), a well-proportioned tangle of fresh pasta ribbons, tomato, red pepper, broccoli rabe, and lamb. It was gently sized, though; even after I polished off two fat slices of crusty bread (from Sullivan Street Bakery) with very good olive oil, a side of roasted parsnips ($5), and the tagliatelle, I easily could have polished off the cavatelli and still had room for dessert. (To be fair, I did skip lunch.) Prunes, mascarpone, and a red wine sauce ($6) combined for some intriguing mouthfuls, but (here's my appetite talking again) I wished the cheese were richer.

Tucked at the very end of a winding road, the Fox Island Seafood House provides a pleasant view of the narrow Byram River, especially from its dining deck. Tonight the view swam a distant second to the food itself, introduced by exceptionally light, tender calamari ($10) spiced with hot peppers. Here it's dubbed \"Boston\" calamari; more commonly it's called \"Rhode Island\" style, though f.i.s.h. dispenses with the just-as-common greasiness.A sizable mignon of Hawaiian tuna ($27), seared but still rare, was rubbed in rosemary and black pepper and served in a red wine sauce; accompanied by haricots verts, onion crisps, and sour cream-blue crab mashed potatoes that offered a tantalizing taste of the sea. Diver scallops wrapped in applewood-smoked bacon ($24), served with celery root puree, wild mushroom risotto, and wilted spinach, also featured fine ingredients, though the applewood flavor was a little much for the shellfish.f.i.s.h.102 Fox Island Rd., Port Chester, New York914-939-4227

Retro diner with additional picnic-table seating.

The cereal at TJ's is OK (I like the granola but only when I don't feel like making it myself) but mainly, I go there for the incredibly cheap cashews, which are very good; dried fruit, esp. in winter; cookies; tea tree oil dishwashing liquid; occasionally some vitamins or cheese or flash-frozen fish; and a few other things.  I don't like most of their frozen food and their produce section is so lame that I don't know why they even bother.

The five-course dinner prix fixe ($35.50), prepared as always by students of the French Culinary Institute, was competently prepared but somehow lacked confidence; other diners at the table also expressed the thought that many items were \"good.\" For my part, I started with a gaily caparisoned leek-pepper-tomato tartlet, chased by sautéed red snapper with citrus fruits and basil — two pretty faces that had little to say. The comparatively drab Basque-style sautéed chicken (shown) had enough body that given the chance I'd order it again. Following a palate-cleansing salad, a dessert of iced port wine parfait with summer melon and shaved chocolate simply tried too hard, though I appreciated the effort, all the way to the bottom of the glass.L'Ecole462 Broadway (at Grand St.)212-219-3300

If you're ventured beyond Shea on the 7 train, not far past the stadium you've seen \"Oriental Food Cash & Carry\" in four-foot-tall capital letters. That sign only hints at the extent of this wide-aisled, warehouse-sized Korean outlet; it's as large as any supermarket I've seen in the five boroughs. Way in the back, near a picnic-like lunch area, a kitchen offers up a limited menu, which (I imagine) you could supplement from the adjacent prepared-food area.Myself, I passed up such ready-to-eat items as a whole squid ($4.99) and a serving of pollock roe ($24.99 per pound) to get my veggies from a serving of sesame leaves ($7.99) heavily seasoned with garlic and red pepper but ultimately tedious, like so many similar Korean presentations.Assi Plaza131-01 39th Ave., Flushing, Queens718-321-8000

Yanjing Lemon Beer (355 ml.; Y1.89) was the color of a pale ginger ale, but even more effervescent; it claims to be flavored with lemon juice, and in fact that's what the smell and taste would bring to mind: lemon juice, not lemons. Blue Diamond Pineapple Beer (350 ml.; Y2.40) was pale amber, with the aroma of Lifesavers and a sour flavor.

Aggressive bait-and-switch bargaining tactics are reportedly typical of the Russian-speaking street merchants in this area west of Ritan Park; on a later occasion, I saw a slab of nutcake from another vendor flung back in his cart, with appropriately colorful comments.

Following appetizers of sweet and pickled cucumber slices (Y18) and pork slices with \"sauce\" (Y38), we feasted on nicely fatty yak tail braised in a clay jar (shown; Y58), with star anise and ginger, and chicken fried with corn, peas, carrots, and a vegetable called juoma (Y45) that came on like succotash with a Tibetan touch. As for my selection from the beverage section of the menu, bowl of yogurt with sugar on the side (Y18) was refreshing, in its way, if not particularly liquid. Makye Ame11 Xiushui Nanjie, Beijing

Kid-friendly old-school diner with a scattering of more-ambitious seasonal touches, like squash blossom fritters with maple syrup (shown; $2.95). Many customers leaned toward the burgers; at our table we favored fried chicken (four pieces; $9.95); crispy outside, moist inside, though the pieces themselves were small. Potatoes were sweet; perhaps dipped in sugar water before frying. For dessert, very pretty cupcakes with frosted \"spines\" from the nearby Cosmic Bakery (under the same ownership, I believe) also made a hit with the kids.

The namesake of this cheery Brazilian restaurant is a claypot stew, prepared in homes throughout the state of Espirito Santo, that's brightened by tomato, onion, and cilantro, with annatto for an additional tang. You'll find enough whitefish in moqueca de peixe (moh-Kay-kuh day Peh-shay; $9.95) that a couple of apps and one entrée would make a meal for two. That's especially true if you use a heavy hand with the pirão, a yucca flour porridge you can add as a starchy thickener with the accompanying rice. Though I didn't try one, a handwritten sign at the counter noted that \"temos rã frita\": fried frog legs were on offer for $3 each. MuQueCa1093 Cambridge St., Cambridge, Massachusetts617-354-3296

The true is that Moqueca (is not \"muqueca\") is not from Espírito Santo, but from Bahia. The Restaurant´s owner lied. You can find more information if you make a research.

Many shaved-ice joints keep the ingredients behind the counter, and the servers do the spooning at their discretion; I prefer the hands-on joints, as long as the ingredients seem well cared for.

The massive food court in the basement level of Taipei 101, currently the world's tallest building, offered less variety than I'd hoped: numerous Chinese restaurants, though nothing terribly specialized; a couple of Japanese joints; one tame venue each for Singaporean, Indian, and (if I remember) Korean. All very clean, the way the cafeteria in a private high school might be clean, and not quite filled with customers who seemed happy to be out of the office but who didn't show enthusiasm for the food.

Interesting place for perusing Japanese package design — to a reggae soundtrack, on a recent visit — while pondering such curiousities as Meiji brand Chelsea yogurt scotch (50 g.; $1.29). Think of lemon yogurt in hard-candy form. A previous visit to the East Village location offered up Calpico brand lychee drink (200 ml.; 59 cents) from a drippy sippy pack. I like lychee, even (or because?) it brings pineapple Live Savers to mind, but this uncarbonated drink tasted especially unnatural. Okazaki brand coffee jelly (three 100 g. containers; $1.99) conjured up my first taste of coffee soda at Rocky's, in my undergrad days. It was paired with those little containers of non-dairy creamer, but like my coffee, I take my jelly black. Sunrise Mart494 Broome St. (near West Broadway)(One of two locations)212-219-0033

At a post-Series sale, I picked up two vintage packs of Topps baseball cards (15 cards plus one stick of bubble gum; $1). The '88 lacks snap, I quickly found, as this downsized stick (roughly half as large as the great vintages of the early '70s) crumbled in my mouth; the '89 is also well past its prime. As for the players, at least one of them still has a little snap on his curveball. This is a great place to poke around for a few minutes; Economy is stacked floor to ceiling with sweets you'd utterly forgotten. Near the front door you can mix and match a bagful of \"old-time candy\" ($1.49 per pound), in my case equal scoops of Mary Janes, Walnettos, Bit-O-Honeys, and root beer barrels. Candy fruit slices ($2.99 per pound) were less satisfying; the version here tastes too much of pectin. Zotz (strip of four; 75 cents) were one of my childhood favorites. Each fruit-flavored hard candy surrounds flavored sodium bicarbonate that fizzes out in a slow leak — until you give in and bite through to the center.

It may not offer the specialties you can find at some downtown Vietnamese restaurants, but what Saigon Grill does it generally does quite well. Three standards: goi du du (shredded green papaya salad; shown at top; $6.25), with grilled beef, shredded carrots, basil, and a slightly spicy dressing with crushed peanuts; bo luc lac (seared steak cubes; shown below; $12.95), with greens and those interesting sesame taro chips; and xuong nuong (grilled pork chops; $8.95) marinated in lemongrass. Although Saigon Grill makes a solid canh chua (hot and sour soup; $6.50 for a large order of the fish and shrimp version), a more interesting and very sizable choice is the Vietnamese seafood bouillabaisse ($14.95) a hot and sour lemongrass and tamarind broth with shrimp, sea scallops, crabmeat, fish, mussels, squid, and vegetables. At least at the West Side location, the Japanese menu extends well beyond sushi and sashimi. Though I tasted my way through the ceviche, tiradito, and usuzukuri, nothing caught my fancy quite like this tuna tartar ($7.75).

Westside's burgers have disappointed me in the past, but a plate of once-fried fries ($3.95) will lay down a proper protective barrier for brew. While it lasts, try a draft pint of the Southhampton pumpkin ale ($6), which harvests a full rounded flavor without wavering toward cloying or bitter. On a previous occasion, a medium-rare burger ($7.95) was mushy, and dressing it with Heinz, Grey Poupon, and a tomato soon made my English muffin soggy. However, a pint of Blue Point Hoptical Illusion ($5) was quite nice: ruddy amber (or was that just a trick of the dim lighting?) with a quickly vanishing creamy head; orangey aroma and taste with underplayed hops.

For a previous, late afternoon nosh, I fared much better with a sturdier item, this hefty square ($1.50) loaded with dates and walnuts and bound together with just enough honey.

Not quite the Zabar's of Brighton Beach, as it's often billed; this expansive store is limited primarily to products from the former Soviet Union. From Russia, here's the Monastirsky brand version of the thirst-quencher called kvas (0.5 l.; 99 cents), a carbonated, nonalcoholic beverage fermented from rye, wheat, barley, or in this instance some unspecified combo. M&I's upstairs dining area, though inelegant, does alway seems to have open seats if you need to take a load off. Selections in the refrigerator case are hearty if quirky; I especially noted a cloudy congealed salad containing carrots, hardboiled egg, and something else, perhaps fish, lurking at the bottom. A smaller dining area downstairs also serves through a window to the street, where you can snack on one of these oblong meat pastries (80 cents).

Russians have really settled in New York, and opened a lot of businesses dating back to the 70’s and 80’s. This food store on Brighton Beach is a classic. Every Russian-American New Yorker has shopped here at least once. But we also have our classic Russian bookstores, cafes, and restaurants. One restaurant that comes to mind is Rasputin on Coney Island Ave. They are more upscale and trendy, offering great food and music on the weekends. So it seems like again that every Russian-American New Yorker has eaten there at least once!

When refrigeration wasn't widely available, pickling was a much more common method of preserving food. The pickled-food section of Beijing's Chongwenmen Caishi Chang displays a continuing fondness for briny flavors; so do many salad bars in Brighton Beach. Though it seemed to have plenty of takers, the watermelon didn't quite work; I much preferred the rind-only version from Grey Mouse Farm. On the other hand, pickling tarted up a golden delicious apple very much to my taste — normally I find them much too sweet — even if Odessa couldn't bother to peel off that little sticker.

One of the few restaurants in New York that specialize in Uighur (Wee-ger) cuisine, native to the region in and around what's now Northwest China; much friendlier than many of the eateries along Brighton Beach Blvd. Sometimes Uighur food shows Chinese roots (but even at the popular Xin Jiang Muslim Restaurant in Beijing, that wasn't the case); at Kashkar the eats lean toward the familiar Central Asian line. Lick your lips over lamb rib kebab ($3.50 for four pieces like this). Also at our table (click the photo to see more): kebabs of chicken ($3) and ground beef ($3); lagman ($5), lamb broth with noodles, meat, and vegetables that our server gladly split for us into half-orders; carrot salad ($5) and eggplant salad ($5); the thin-skined lamb dumplings called manty (four for $6); samsa ($2 each) dough pies with lamb that today were offered in two cholesterol levels (get the fatty lamb, if it's not sold out); naryn ($6), a curious combo of dough with seasoning, sliced sausage, and tripe; and naan ($2), here in the form of a Frisbee-sized flatbread.

(This venue is closed.) Sibling to Bing, but here the stuffed pastry with cabbage, Chinese mushrooms, and \"dried baby shrimp seed\" ($1.50) costs a half-buck more than in Flushing. (When naming their restaurant, I wonder, were the owners of Roll & Dough conjuring a sound-alike for \"rollin' in dough\"?) To be fair, this relatively new West Village outpost offers a more expansive menu, as well as seating and delivery, but the vagaries of supply and demand allowed this particular pastry to sit too long.

***CONTENT
In a neighborhood filled with high-priced restaurants, Via Emilia recently graduated from a simply decorated, almost spartan storefront to a modish new location off Park Avenue South, yet you can still sit down to a great meal without turning out your pockets. You might start, as my friend Mike and I did, with the salad of smoked duck, baby spinach, green apples, and walnuts ($9); for a splurge, try the parmigiano and pears with 25-year-old balsamic vinegar (shown; at $15, the priciest appetizer). Or you could go rustic with gnocco frito, as I did more than once at Via Emilia's old location; they're hot, slightly oily puffs that you slice open, then stuff at the table with cured meats. On a Friday, an order of fresh spaghetti with frutti di mare ($13) suited me fine; previously, I've also enjoyed the chicken-and-mushroom tortelloni with truffled olive oil, the tagliatelle al ragu, and the pumpkin tortelloni. Mike had at the grilled seasoned pork chop ($15.50) and the roasted beets and onion ($7); for dessert, he was pleased with his profiteroles ($8.50). I was exceedingly pleased by flourless chocolate cake with mascarpone ($8), a deep dessert glass in which tipped-up slabs of cake threatened to sink into a pool of sweet, creamy cheese.

Excellent produce section, even if all I had a mind for today was a Macintosh (90 cents, at $1.99 per pound). Wish I had 24/7 options like this in my neighborhood. On a previous visit, Santander dark chocolate, 70 percent cacao (70 g.; $2.49), a Columbian single-origin chocolate from the Eastern state of Santander, had a bitter and somewhat floral aroma that turned assertive, and a little nutty, on the tongue. A small portion, held in reserve for the next morning, outmatched my mug of supermarket French roast coffee. Gracefully28 Ave. A (2nd-3rd Sts.)212-677-8181

For game 7 of the Mets-Cards NLCS, I would have loved a sandwich from Leo's Latticini, but that nearby Corona landmark generally closes at 5:00, and the stadium outlet, on the field level, wasn't open to a ticketholder from the upper deck. Dinner instead was a corn dog (overfried, too sweet, and as lightweight as the Mets bats), a couple of Nathan's hot dogs (their usual selves), and beer in a plastic cup (nothing like it). As for Leo's, wait till next year. Shea StadiumFlushing, Queens

Tiny but amiable Columbia student favorite for belly-filling meals from Southwest Mexico, such as chicken pipian ($9.95), in a cilantro-green pumpkinseed sauce. Their housemade version of sweet rice drink called horchata ($2.25) is very cinnamony. Watching the grillmen up front is sure to get your appetite going (especially if you're temporarily consigned to the sidewalk). On previous occasions: A taco filled with carne asada (beef steak; $2.75) was a little dry; a taco al pastor (pork strips with pineapple; $3) was moist and tangy; my \"stretch\" order, an oreja (pork ear; $3), was just too chewy. Fish tacos ($3.50) also turned out a little dry, without much flavor. The owner mentioned that they were using jackfish, a common name that seems to refer to any number of species, only because bluefish, which \"makes the best fish tacos,\" was unavailable that day.

(That well may be where the name comes from, but I wasn't comfortable asking the counterman any more about a kiss.)

I do not recommend ANYONE patronize this establishment, Kashkaval, EVER. The owner, a man named Pando, keeps dozens of cats and kittens locked in the cellar ... they receive no vet care, they are not spayed or neutered
(he refuses to do so, they are sick and malnourished and quite often the kittens escape into the streets of Hell's Kitchen, never to be seen again. This man is a cruel and ignorant abuser of animals. While he claims they are \"his family,\" when he lost his last store (The Ninth Avenue Cheese Store) he dumped all his cats into the alley behind the store and abandoned them there. He does not deserve to be the caretaker of creatures that need attention and someone with a sense of responsibility. PLEASE do not give this man your money. He is a wretched human being.

Zabb City and its Woodside namesake are Isaan restaurants (or Isan, or Esan), rooted near Thailand's Northeast border with Laos. Here, as back home, most dishes display a straightforward preparation and presentation, but the spice level in New York is considerably muted. From the Queens outlet, the green papaya salad called som tum (top photo; $7.50) was flavored with salted crab, plus chili and a satisfying sourness of lime. (By contrast, a similar som tum I sampled in Vientiene, Laos, gave me the hiccoughs after one mouthful; it was so hot that not only did I leave half of it behind, but it woke me urgently at 4:00 a.m.) From the West Village location, grilled beef (bottom photo; $8.95) was a stereotypical \"stick with the basics\" appetizer; beef labb (or laab, or larb; $7.95) though classified as a salad, was mainly minced meat. Also at the table: a \"fresh roll\" ($6.95) exhibited crisp, clean herbal flavors; green curry with pork ($9.95) and chicken in ginger sauce ($9.95) were fine.

Rock-and-roll radio often entertains the short-order cooks over lunch at this Japanese eatery; dinnertime, though less bustling, is hardly sedate. Whatever the hour, I tend to lean toward the tantan-men (ramen \"in sesame paste hot soup\"; $8.05, here with $1 worth of extra noodles). From a deep, 10-inch-wide bowl, a mound of greens, plus a little scallion and ground pork, emerge high and dry from the center; the black pepper swimming beneath soon gives rise to a pleasant burn at the back of the throat. On other occasions, I've sampled the mabo ramen ($7.30) with minced pork and bean curd; on the thin side, even with an extra $2 worth of noodles.

Bierkraft carries cheese and charcuterie, dozens of preserves, jams, marinades, and spreads — even New Orleans' favorite brand of potato chips, Zapp's (Spicy Cajun Crawtators; 5.5 oz.; $2.50) — but the namesake attraction is a painstakingly stocked wall-length refrigerator case boasting 900 brews. Victory Harvest Ale (64 oz. draft growler; $10.95), Downingtown, Pennsylvania. Ruddy amber with a tall, longstanding, parchment-colored head, perhaps enhanced by a long jouncing walk to my poker game. Aroma and flavor lean toward malty and rounded rather than hoppy, compared with many others in the fine Victory line. On previous visits: Ithaca Apricot Wheat (12 oz.; $2), Ithaca, New York. The apricot aroma almost seems not to belong to the beer itself, and in fact there's little apricot taste, and no tartness, bite, or finish, in this murky golden beer. Lion Lager (333 ml.; $2), Biyagama, Sri Lanka. If this were the only beer on the island after a hard day in the sun, perhaps I'd feel different, but this medium gold lager is otherwise scarcely discernible from water. Time for a Tiger. Coal Porter (12 oz.; $1.75), Bar Harbor and Portland, Maine. Very dark brown, with a lingering, almost smoky taste. As half of a \"black and blue,\" a little too strong for the brewery's Blueberry Ale; cute name, though. Hitachino Nest Lacto Sweet Stout (11.2 fl. oz.; $5), Naka-gun, Ibaraki, Japan. Dark brown, with a caramel flavor and a tall, thick head that I could almost scoop out with my fingers. Reminiscent of a root beer float after you add the vanilla ice cream. Indeed, the label states that it's \"brewed with pale, crystal-caramel malt and authentic lactose.\" Bierkraft191 Fifth Ave. (Union St.-Berkeley Place), Brooklyn718-230-7600

About 20 years ago Tom's, the Mill, and College Inn were the three most-frequented diners in the Columbia University neighborhood. Tom's has retained its looks inside and especially outside (it's the exterior for Monk's Diner on Seinfeld); apart from the lime rickey, the Mill now has an all-Korean menu. As for College Inn, it's been made over with large photos of 1940's diner interiors that aren't necessarily this diner or even this neighborhood, and with shelves of coffee tins, toys, bowling pins, and tchachkes that are props rather than keepsakes. The staff are friendly, even if they just work here. A three-egg spinach-and-mushroom omelet (with rye toast and chunky home fries; $8.25) was very buttery and filling; so were three scrambled, on an earlier visit.

A slightly spicy green papaya salad ($7) seemed tired; long beans provided a nice crunch, but baby shrimp added little more than color. An open-faced crepe of Berkshire pork and chives (bottom photo; $9) — accompanied by bean sprouts, mint, cilantro, and the Cambodian fish sauce called tuk trey, all for loading into Boston lettuce bindles — was a pleasantly messy assemble-it-yourself production. Could use some basil, a more tangy tuk trey, and perhaps a lighter touch with the ground peanuts. Kampuchea Noodle Bar78 Rivington St. (at Allen St.)212-529-3901

For a bistro with a touch of attitude, service was more than considerate, even if some dishes underperformed. Best was the first: a substantial appetizer of salmon tartare ($15) in a tantalizingly tangy-sweet yuzu mustard vinaigrette. A skate wing ($25), served over snap peas, artichokes, and pearl onions, was moist and meaty; lamb shank ($32) was good, though one order required more-thorough heating. As for dessert, a caramelized lemon tart (about $8) was very, very tart indeed; even when filled with ice cream, profiteroles (three for about $8) shouldn't require a serrated knife.

Clam dip (8 fl. oz.; $5), under the Off Shore Seafood brand, sported plentiful tidbits of chopped shellfish, but the overall texture was a little firm; might be better with more sour cream, less cream cheese. Another time, the clam chili (frozen; $3.50 per pint) turned out soupy and tomatoey when reheated, though it was certainly full of clams strips.

When I first read that La Grolla takes its name from a \"traditional Valdostan coffee service,\" I wondered what role the Near East or Central Asia might play at an Italian restaurant. In fact, the Valle d'Aosta (say it fast) is tucked in next to France and Switzerland and home to a language variously named Arpitan or Franco-Provençal, whose contributions to English include \"glacier,\" \"avalanche,\" and \"chalet.\" Next time you're snowbound, I wrote after my first visit, you'll be fortunate if the kitchen can rustle up carciofi ($11), roasted baby artichokes served with a surprising cruncy almond pesto. Even more satisfying was the coniglio ($20.50), rabbit and potatoes roasted in white wine and rosemary. Ricotta cheesecake ($7) was good, too. So how to reconcile that visit with my recent veal lasagna Valdostana ($15.95), \"layered with veal, béchamel, and fontina\" but evoking memories of Boyardee? Hard to believe it came from the same kitchen. La Grolla413 Amsterdam Ave. (79th-80th Sts.)212-496-0890

Considering the roster of some 70 named varieties, 40 or so optional toppings, a half-dozen bun and bread options, and a choice of beef patty or grilled chicken breast, it's no wonder I can never remember just what I've tried here. Most recently I headed for the Route 66 ($8.95): avocado, bacon, and swiss on dark rye bread. Not bad once compacted into burgerlike form, but next time I'll take mine on a bun. Since Island Burgers doesn't serve fries, only baked potatoes (with any of those 40 toppings) or \"dirty\" chips, when I arrive here extra-hungry I tend toward the black-and-white milkshake ($4.25). It's a loose swirl of chocolate and vanilla, with a consistency not far from soft-serve ice cream; sipping it is a pleasantly slow task, best performed on island time.

The amazing, rich cream of crab soup ($9), aswim with lump crabmeat, was reason enough to take my shore leave at Dobbs Ferry (another is the marvelous view, especially if you sigh over the Hudson River School). Grilled swordfish (about $24) with a baked potato, sour cream, and broccoli, and pan-seared sea scallops (about $22) in a soy-ginger broth with spinach, bok choy, and coconut ginger rice, are substantial entrees, but after placing an advance order for dessert, I was already biding my time. The kitchen needs about 25 minutes' notice to prepare the \"lava cake\" (about $9), a hot chocolate soufflé with a molten center, topped with vanilla ice cream and crunchy chocolate, surrounded by chocolate sauce. It's well worth the early decision on dessert. The Chart HouseAt the foot of High St., Dobbs Ferry, New York(one of many locations)203-978-0268

From the upstairs cheese department, Brin d'Amour ($20.99 per pound) was bedecked with rosemary, peppercorns, and juniper berries and drizzled with olive oil, but cheese gave no account of itself beyond a firm yet pliant foundation. On numerous later occasions: La serena ($11.99 per pound). Sandy brown with a dusting of white outside, off-white inside; soft-to-semisoft interior with small, irregular pocketing; acrid. Vacherin Fribourg ($11.99 per pound). Caramel-colored outside, with tiny white mold spotting, butter yellow inside; faint aroma of overripe milk; firm but creamy smooth; nutty overtones. Fig cake with walnuts and hazelnuts ($6.99 per pound). Mislabeled, it turns out; this one has whole almonds. The fruit flavor is just too much, and even when a bite contained a nut, the contrast in textures made me want to chew the fig, or the almond, but not both at the same time. Manchego madara ($12.99 per pound), an unpasteurized sheep's milk cheese from Spain, paired with Corazon del Sol brand membrillo (240 g.; $4.99).

And though Indian selections are still a regular feature — today, chicken in butter sauce — the menu has been whittled down because so many of the expats prefer to pack home cooking. From the \"international buffet,\" this creditable Jamaican sampler (40 cents per ounce) included jerk chicken, spicy potato salad, cod, curried vegetables, rice and peas, and a papaya-shrimp salad.

(This venue is closed.) A drink, and perhaps a sandwich (prepared off-premises), are typical fare at this Morningside Heights hangout. But on special occasions, the owner — who passes his other working hours at the Burgundy Wine Co. — will beckon customers to the covered pool table for a buffet of pub grub such as seafood stew with monkfish, baby octopus, squid, shrimp, onions, and tomatoes, or this Cajun meatloaf centered around hard-boiled eggs and flecked with vegetables. St. Patrick's Day brings the opportunity to put down a protective layer of corned beef, cabbage, and scalloped potatoes (the eating, like the drinking, starts early) and if you're lucky, to sample the soda bread made by Bartley Della, a pastry chef and the man behind that meatloaf. It's quite moist, at least for soda bread, and Bartley also coaxes out an underlying sourness that balances the sweetness of the raisins. Muse over this marvel, but don't stray too near the dartboard. The Night Café938 Amsterdam Ave. (106th-107th Sts.)212-864-8889

Easy to see why Old Heidelberg is a refuge for Mittel European expats; that crisp golden skin sealed in nearly endless slabs, shreds, and morsels of juicy meat. For dessert, this night I homed in on the bienenstich ($6), a \"bee hive cake\" topped with thin-sliced caramelized almonds and filled with Bavarian custard, but I'll also vouch for its alter-ego, a very rich, super moist Black Forest cake ($7).

Waiting their turn in back: a sweet-tangy-salty combo of baked beans with burnt ends. On another visit, the \"bowl o' red\" (12 oz.; $6) — also available from Daisy May's midtown street cart — was a great meal in itself, though I'm not crazy about the yellow cheese.

Not far from the Arthur Ave. Italian district, this corner grocery lured me inside with a windowful of Eastern European packaged goods. Fant brand meat seasoning mix (40 g.; $1) uses onion, garlic, \"spices,\" and MSG to give a Croatian touch to burgers. Mixed with a little water and then with ground meat, it created a gloppy paste that stuck to my palms, but the payoff was nice charring after just a few moments in the frying pan. On other occasions: E. Wedel brand pierniczki alpejskie sliwkowe (chocolate-covered gingerbread hearts; 160 g., $1.50), from Poland, were OK for a factory product. Eurocrem brand hazelnut, milk, and cocoa spread (100 g.; $1), from Serbia, was too firm and lacked flavor. Scalinada Market and Deli Grocery667 East 187th St. (at Cambreleng Ave.), Bronx718-367-7256

The olives, cheeses, sausages, and other deli items are predominantly Greek, but Mediterranean Foods also offers savories and sweets from the Middle East and Near East as well as Southern and Eastern Europe. A little expensive, but well-kept and freshly stocked, even to the open tins of fish on the counter, and worthy of repeated exploration. Soutzioukkos (shown; 500 g.; $5.99) — a traditional sweet from Cyprus that also appears in various forms from the Levant to the Black Sea — congeals sweetened grape juice around a string (literally) of almonds. Even a single six-inch \"log\" might prove tedious for any one person: the flavor, though pleasant, tastes far more of grape than almond, and the rubbery texture is very resilient. On a previous visit: The chimneysweep and other illustrations on my bag of Pionir brand Negro Odzacar Gala (100 g.; 99 cents) suggested filled, licorice-flavored hard candies; they proved copper-sulfate blue, with more of a menthol taste.

Onion in spanakopita? You've got to be kidding! (Green onion, yes. I hope that's what you mean.) Spinach, dill, green onion, parsley, egg, feta. That's all it takes.

Great site.

Linger a few moments before the display case and its amazing array of Middle Eastern mezze, and you may wonder how you'll ever narrow down your order. (Your server will happily provide all the guidance you could want, but perhaps it's easier simply to bring along a few more friends.) The basics — housemade za'atar bread, smooth lemon-and garlic-scented hummus, and lightly smoky babaghanouj — are exemplary; you'll also find the babaghanouj layered on the crispy eggplant napoleon (top photo; $6.50) and topped with chopped tomato and basil salad. A deceptively humble \"salad\" of browned cauliflower buds (middle photo; $5.50), topped with tahini sauce, pomegranate syrup, and parsley, is easily shared but best positioned within arm's reach. Also highly recommended: musakhan ($6), to all appearances a personal pizza topped with chicken, caramelized onion, sumac, spices, roasted nuts, and olive oil. Leave adequate room (and give the kitchen 20 minutes' notice) for the knafeh (bottom photo; $12), a dessert of shredded phyllo stuffed with sweet cheese, baked, and topped with syrup and pistachios. Sharable by six, though at my table I'd insist on fewer, fatter slices. Tanoreen7704 Third Ave. (77th-78th Sts.), Brooklyn718-748-5600Closed Monday

If the name didn't do it, the oversized photo of buckwheat fields would clue you in: noodles are the thing at Soba Nippon. In truth, I'm partial to their udon, slippery smooth noodles with an al dente bite, served cold or in a hot bonito-and-kelp broth. Shown at top are the simplest, Sanuki-style version ($11). On another occasion, I ordered the soba, a housemade blend of 20 percent wheat and 80 percent buckwheat, with tororo, or grated yam ($15). The noodles themselves were thin, delicate, and darker-hued than the udon; the yam, which looked like a puddle of grated Parmesan in the center of the bowl, had a slippery yet grainy texture and not much flavor. That broth, on the other hand, I drained to the last few drops. On another, brutally hot summer day, a cold beef soba salad (bottom photo; $19.80) filled a large plate with noodles, lettuce, carrots, onions (on request), plus a little seaweed, topped with two tender, thin slices of lightly cooked beef, sesame seeds, and a nice, somewhat vinegary dressing. An expensive lunchtime salad, but big and satisfying without being overwhelming. Soba Nippon19 West 52nd St. (Fifth-Sixth Aves.)212-489-2525

This small Cuban cafeteria isn't much on looks, but they're friendly and they serve great, filling food. A Wednesday special, octopus salad (top photo; $8.50), soaks thin, al dente slices in a vinaigrette with pepper, onion, and green olives with pimentos. On Mondays and Thursdays, consider the surprisingly tender duo of tripe and pig's feet (bottom photo; $7), if you have a half-hour to worry away the pork from all those little bones. Entrees are accompanied by a plateful of rice and beans wetted down with beef gravy, plus fried plantain. Wash it down with a tropical shake ($3.25) — I'm partial to the tamarind — or a morir soñando ($3.50), which blends orange juice, milk, sugar, and ice and translates literally as \"to die dreaming.\" Margon136 West 46th St. (Sixth-Seventh Aves.)212-354-5013

My finance and I thought we would try this place out b/c it looked cute and we both love seafood.  Big Mistake.  When we arrived, we were told that they did not have room for us even though we made reservations.  After waiting for 45 minutes, we finally got a table.  After we were seated though, we witnessed the most disgusting thing ever...  the waiter recycled someone else's used butter, added a little more to the container, and gave it to us with some bread.  I can only imagine what else they \"recycle\" here.

We did end up starting a conversation with some people next to us that was enjoyable - but we will still never go back here.

Also look for pale green dudhi halwa, made from squash. On another occasion, a pistachio-flecked square of almond burfi (bottom photo; 75 cents) hovered somewhere between fudge and marzipan.

Con Sõl's very dark dining room all but concealed some ambitious \"Iberian cuisine,\" including a dense polvo guisada, octopus stewed with potatoes and red wine ($8) and somewhat stringy cordonizes, marinated quail grilled and topped with a red wine gravy ($6). Carne porco alentejana, chunks of pork loin stwered with clams and topped with cubed potatoes and onions ($11), was ample but lacked complexity; paella Valenciana, with clams, shrimp, scallops, chicken, and linguica (shown; $13) seemed busy, and not fully one with itself. Even so, the fact that everything was prepared and served by just one man suggests a lot of promise, once restaurant-permit problems and other growing pains iron themselves out.

Largely a Romanian bakery, by the looks of the newspapers behind the counter, though one was in Hungarian and another two or three eluded quick identification. One my first visit, this poppyseed square ($1.25) packed loads of moist filling between two dense, buttery layers. A curious savory item — a corrugated sheet (about $6.50 per pound) that had a buttery sheen, a sprinkle of cumin, and the texture of a pretzel left to fend for itself in humid weather — suggested that next time I might be happier with the sweets. Point taken: Nita's Linzer torte cookies ($1.10) are right on target. Named after the Austrian latticed pastry, the twinned cookies are often flavored with hazelnut or almond; raspberry jam is the customary filling, though I've heard that red currant sometimes makes an appearance.

For a simple, late-afternoon belly-warmer, a bowl of mo hangar ($5.99) — rice noodles in sour catfish soup, with cilantro and very hot red pepper flakes on the side — was very promising. On another visit; the duck soup with sour mustard ($6.99) was comforting, and just a little tangy; squash fritters ($4.99) were fine, but the gram fritters (made from yellow split peas; $4.99) were too dry; green tea leaf salad ($5.99) added a tannic layer to a hepped-up hodgepodge of tomato, cabbage, and peanuts. The fiery-looking pork and onion curry with mango pickle ($4.99) was a pussycat; fried butterfish curry simmered in a blend of spices ($6.99) was fine with its accompanying vegetables, too fishy without; mushroom and watercress with garlic ($7.99) was simple and satisfying.

The steak sandwich ($13) was pretty good, though not too heavy on the meat; very good fries. Chatham cod ($22) had a nicely browned top and very tender underside, but I could easily have cupped it in my hand. With two parmesan hushpuppies, over a scanty pool of succotash with bacon.

Though it sounds like a harvesttime special, in May I was pleasantly surprised to find the Little Pie Co's signature offering, sour cream apple walnut pie (slice; $2), after wedging my way through the scrum at the Ninth Ave. Food Festival. How good is it? Once, for an in-office luncheon, I paired it off against a pale yellow key lime pie (10 inches; $18). The key lime was almost puddinglike in texture — even when chilled — with a subdued yet decisive citrus tang. In other company, a winner, but that afternoon the clear favorite was the sour cream apple walnut (10 inches; $25). In cross-section, it bared numerous thin slices of apple topped with a knobby crust that readily shed crumbs during slicing. From across the room, it was very telling to watch a fellow editor resolutely corral those crumbs with his fingers; none was spared.

There's no one resource I rely on -- I usually find myself scrambling to keep up with any number of newspapers and magazines (in print and online), as well as websites, mailing lists, and tips from friends and kindly strangers -- so as long as I'll be taking the trouble, I hope to pass along more news like this in advance.

Laxpudding ($11), a salmon-and-potato combo with leek and dill, traditionally is served with melted butter, but a squeeze of lemon also suited it well; Kristall brand lingonberry soda ($3) might've paired better with the Swedish meatballs or one of the wraps. A slice of pear and cardamom pie, enrobed in vanilla sauce ($4), was humbler than all that; on another visit I'd reach for one of the more portable chocolate sweets, and a cup of coffee (well-regarded, and reportedly bottomless).

(Formerly Waterfront International; same owners and chef.) The crispy lamb with chili pepper ($10.95) is even more mouth-watering once you've taken a bite. You'll quickly recognize cumin as an unnamed but dominant flavoring; it's common throughout China's colder climes. (The restaurant's cuisine has roots in the northeast, not far from Korea.) Celery dumplings (12 for $4.95) proved to be pork-and-celery, without crunch, but still an interesting variation on a theme; the broth in the lamb soup ($6.95) was terrific, and there's plenty to share. (Shown below, that's just an individual-serving bowl, in front of the amuse bouche of peanuts and kimchi-like cabbage.) Can't wait to explore this menu further.

One of two businesses sharing a narrow storefront, this Halal operation will give you something to chew on while waiting for your ride: assorted chicken parts, not all of them meaty, various hot-sauced tripe dishes, and what was identified by another customer as lamb, though my guess would have been mutton. Hot pepper optional. My half-pounder included a sizable shank, so the price per pound ($9) was effectively higher; the meat that surrounded it was tolerably good, but no better than you'd expect from bus-stop fare.

Despite plumbing the depths of the swing-top freezer, I've never located Oak Grove's green onion sausage, but the \"country style\" sage version ($6.95 per pound) browned up well for breakfast. I was less successful with the scrapple (1 lb.; $3.50), a Pennsylvania Dutch favorite that begins as a mush of pork leftovers and cornmeal that's condensed into a brick, to be sliced and fried. Overeager defrosting and sloppy slicing led me to make a hash of things, and that's being unfair to hash. Another attempt to follow. Occasionally Oak Grove also sets out a table of baked goods; one brisk day, a pumpkin whoopee pie ($2) was very creamy and nicely spiced.

Best to order the chicken (three-piece \"box\"; $9) rather than dither over the menu; though this time the crisp, well-salted skin adhered imperfectly, the meat itself was very moist. Includes a biscuit and one side — here, a special of black-eyed peas with a major pepper jolt. Pie (slice; $4) was a tougher choice, but the countergal's favorite did me just fine; the rhubarb still offered toothsome resilience.

On previous visits, other Eastern European standards proved sturdy if unspectacular: slices of the stuffed phyllo pies called bureks ($4.95); veal soup ($4.95); garlicky cucumber yogurt salad $4.95); and peppers stuffed with ground beef and rice ($10.95) which would seem smallish if not for a buttress of mashed potatoes. Beyond the baklava, the dozen desserts ($1.95 to $5.95) will need some explaining from your server.

At an Independence Day affair in Madison Square Park, the juicy jalapeño-cheese sausage from Kreuz (rhymes with \"Friday Night Lights\"; $6) was a green-flecked beauty with a spicy attitude; the \"Texas black-eyed caviar\" ($4) had only their name to commend them. Circled back later for a trio of immense pork spare ribs ($7) whose strikingly pepper-flecked, ruddy exterior concealed pinkish, rubbery meat that I didn't feel obligated to fully clean from the bones. The brisket — which I finally tackled at Hill Country's restaurant-market — is fantastic. Some reports suggested ordering half lean (lying across the top; $16.75 per pound) and half \"moist\" (front and center; $18.50 per pound), then mixing the two; next time, the fattier cut will do me very well by itself. Chipotle deviled eggs ($3.95) tasted of lime, too; baked beans ($9.50 for about a pint) had a burnt molasses tang but precious few burnt ends; corn pudding ($8.50 for about a pint) was a warm, pleasant palate-cleanser. The banana pudding with vanilla wafers ($6) is nice, even if the wafers had been submerged for a spell. Hill Country30 West 26th St. (Broadway-Sixth Ave.)212-255-4544

The chef at the Cotton Club has little opportunity to bake for the nighttime crowd, the lady at this table tells me, but he does prepare sweets for this twice-a-week outdoor market. Although I gave a good, hard look at a radiant slice of sweet potato pie ($3), ultimately I gave the nod to the apple raisin cake ($2.50): extremely moist, with lots of fruit flavor and an over-the-top butter frosting.

Excellent milkshakes, though a recent chocolate malted (large; $3.50) was sorta thin, something like an egg cream (a dollar less for the same \"large,\" about 20 fl. oz.). I prefer vanilla egg creams, and many folks won't waver from chocolate, but Ray's will mix in some 20 flavors; since the coffee-cup size is just $1.25, you can try two or three, easy.

\"These chubs had a good life,\" observed the counterman as he wrapped two fat fish ($6.49 per half-pound). They came to a finger-lickin' good end, too. Another visit followed a disappointment at International Pickle Day, when Orchard St. came up short on the chocolate-covered version. Maybe I don't know from kugel, but the Russ & Daughters version of noodle pudding ($6.95 per pound) seemed very bland. Even with a dollop or two of sour cream to coax out some contrasting flavors, a scattering of golden raisins and a sprinkle of cinnamon barely made their presence felt. For sweet-and-salty fish, Swedish style, try the delectable beet-apple-herring salad ($2 for this quarter-pound). Or if there's no convenient bench nearby where you can settle in with a fork, why not have 'em make you a sandwich? Russ & Daughters179 East Houston St. (Orchard-Allen Sts.)212-475-0345

Sweet rice banana candies (6 oz.; $1.25) are marshmallow light, if droopy; though the banana \"flavoring\" tastes phony, they're addictive. Many other curiosities beg a look; I may never take a live turtle or bullfrog into the kitchen, but charcuterie prepared from duck and quail deserve a try. A plum drink (30.43 fl. oz.; $1.79), from Taiwan, had many flavors competing for attention — dried hawthorne, dried orange peel, liquorice, osmanthus, honey, and sugarcane — though prune predominated. Yeo's kaya (320 g.; 99 cents), from Malaysia, is a pandan-flavored coconut spread that's also a traditional toast-topper in Singapore. The pandan — a leaf widely used in Southeast Asian cuisine — gives it a greenish cast and moderates what otherwise would be an overly cloying flavor.

(This venue is closed.) Smoked shrimp wasn't my thought going in — Oklahoma Smoke takes evident pride in its Southwestern heritage, and I'd stopped by just days after the soft opening (sit-down service, and longer hours, are scheduled for mid-August) — but I'm glad, very glad, that I took their suggestion. Good to know, too, that they peel 'em, you just eat 'em. In addition to a can of iced tea, my shrimp ($8) included a side of firm collard greens flavored with smoked meat; an additional side, rice and beans, soaked up the remaining broth. Love to try the mac 'n' cheese and candied yams, mains like the brisket and the pork jerk ribs, and halfway measures like a baked potato, smoked and then stuffed with a choice of BBQ chicken, beef, or pork. Also some more of that smoked shrimp. Oklahoma Smoke BBQ231 West 145th St. (Frederick Douglas-Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Blvds.)212-862-5335

I'm not sure how much time she spends at each location, but if you see a gal taking orders on her cell while working the stove, that might be a good time to give Ale!!! Silly Goose a try.

Good to see someone else, besides me, take a stand for the Ssam - which seems to rank right up there with foods that Chowhounders love to hate. Both times I've had it, I felt the same way; the flavors mesh and play off of each other, and that Berkshire Pork is a sure fire winner. I have yet to try their dinner menu, which, as you probably know, gets raves. That squid salad looks like it's worth the price of admission all by itself.

Unless you're standing in just the right spot in Le Parker Meridien's blocklong atrium, you won't spot the only signs of this out-of-place eatery: a neon burger, and, often, a line of customers out the door. At busy times you might wait ten minutes or so to reach the counter — plenty of time to take in the mismatched wood paneling, assorted TV and movie posters, kids' drawings, and miscellaneous scrawled tributes — and another ten minutes before your order is ready.

In contrast to this restaurant's expansive dining area — in warmer weather, a large deck affords a view of the waterfront — The Saltwater Grille's menu is somewhat more modest in size but distinctively trimmed top to bottom. Rather than a bread basket, for example, the pastry chef supplies a gruyere bread puff for an airy amuse bouche.

Beat-up Bowery dweller on the outside, well-provisioned Vietnamese grocery on the inside. Not for produce, though; Tan Tin Hung is best for packaged goods and the array of hand-packaged sticky-rice sweets like Banh Tet chuoi dac biet (sweet rice and banana \"cake\"; $3), resting here on its banana-leaf wrap. Those are red beans studding the outside; the now purplish-brown banana was rolled within. Also tried the Asian Boy basil seed drink with honey (12 fl. oz.; 75 cents), which happened to hail from Taiwan. It had an unnatural note not known in any beehive; from the label, I later learned, banana flavor had been added here, too. Tan Tin Hung Supermarket121 Bowery (Grand-Hester Sts.)212-274-8811

(This venue is closed.) Several varieties of the sandwiches called banh mi are on offer at Tu Quynh, but I always get hung up on the elaborate spread of Vietnamese treats. Limiting myself to just one, or perhaps two, is the problem. Take these cured pork mini-sausages (10 to a half-pound package; $5). The meat is nothing special, but that garlic-and-pepper touch makes a tantalizing impression. Would be a great bar snack. On another visit, around dessert time, I ultimately settled on a trio of glutinous rice balls filled with mung bean paste (one is shown in cutaway view), swamped in coconut milk, and topped with sesame seeds of varied toastiness ($1.50). Probably very tasty at room temperature, but the lady at the counter obligingly warmed them up before I carried them off to the park. Tu Quynh Center230 Grand St. (Elizabeth St.-Bowery)212-966-6878

Also, next to the Flushing Main Street library - where you can get them for free - these guys offer up the cheapest  assortment of Vietnamese CDs in town. I think you can get three for 10 bucks or something like that. I've been tempted.

Even if you're not serenaded by Sandinista!, as I was on a recent visit, you'll appreciate this tiny restaurant's devotion to upwardly mobile blue-collar chow. From the specials list, which runs nearly as long as the standing menu, my pork chop ($13) was smothered in mushrooms and grilled onions that were almost caramel-sweet, with just a little pucker; the pork chop itself was solid. Blueberry pie a la mode ($6) was even more simply plated and equally satisfying. Westville210 West 10th St. (West 4th-Bleecker Sts.)212-741-7971

It's $2.50. As for looks: Inside the bakery, where the various loaves poke out endwise from their countertop basket, they seemed considerably more attractive; next time, I'll ask if I can't take a photo there. Even though I learn new things all the time as an amateur food stylist on the go, there's little to be done with flat loaf, flat bench, and hungry, impatient me.

Is this the world's messiest national dish? Imagine gnawing on a heavily sauced rack of ribs, then replace the bones with an exoskeleton that serves as a \"meat shield\" around some of the best tidbits, and you'll have a feel for Singapore chili crab. Once I found myself a seat — two free hands are essential — I needed about half an hour to slurp dry those legs and claws and worry loose most of the remaining crabmeat with a plastic knife and fork. (For a change, I'd also remembered to pinch open the plastic bag containing the cutlery, and my napkin, before I was wrist-deep in sauce.) This version ($5) was very coconutty, but it needed more chili, and the chicken curry I tried later ($5) was also sweet and mild; the festival organizers may have calibrated the spice level with an eye on potential U.S. tourists. I didn't venture the dry-looking chicken satay or the roti prata, but at the demonstration table I snared a fine sample of kueh dadar, a crepe wrapped around coconut and palm sugar.

Trays of fresh breads and pastries were still being slid into the self-serve racks when I arrived at dusk at this very friendly Mexican bakery. This sweet, flaky, almost cookielike flatbread (80 cents) was the lightweight of the bunch in heft only; by any other measure it's a champ. On a return visit, my fondness for strawberry Junket drew me to a custard pastry ($1). Too firm, I found, and fairly empty of flavor, but an easy experiment for a buck.

I find Spoonbread's a bit on the heavy side. Try the fried chicken at 107 West! A light crunch and a neat trick of partailly deboning the quarters for that elusive goal of even cooking. Sietsma of the Voice concurs, for the record. A solid restaurant all around, in fact, that I see you have so far missed.

Small and \"unconstructed\" it may seem, but this restaurant's previous digs (under its former name, A) were even cozier for both customers and staff. The menu remains very trim — just six apps and five entrées, including this sliced chicken breast with lime and jerk spices in a papaya puree ($15). Carefully composed, as you can see, though the flavor did shift abruptly from fruitiness at the front of the mouth to a peppery gnawing at the back; sopping up puree with a little couscous helped maintain the sweet-spicy balance. cAfé973 Columbus Ave. (107th-108th Sts.)212-222-2033www.marcandblue.com

This was my first visit, and perhaps the diner has expanded; in addition to a 6-to-8-seat \"kitchen,\" there's a \"front room\" with garlands of plastic roses hanging from the ceiling. That's where I sat, with two hungry cops, a pair of conversationalists who didn't eat or budge the hour I was there, a handful of actual customers, and one fellow watching Judge Maria Lopez on the TV.

The filling of xiao long bao, the \"little basket buns\" commonly called soup dumplings in the States, includes a small amount of pork gelatin. When the dumplings are heated, the gelatin melts, and the resulting broth is sealed within, or should be. On a recent visit, though the filling and broth were tasty as ever, crab-and-pork soup dumplings (eight for $8.50) were sloppily wrapped, and some were already oozing when the basket reached the table. A Shanghai-style favorite of mine, shredded eel with yellow chives, was unavailable that evening (the eel delivery fell through, we were told). Another longtime favorite, crispy yellow fish fingers with dried seaweed ($13.95), were tender and flaky within, and accompanied by the usual potent salt-pepper mix, but the batter, though light and crisp, was short the seaweed.

The toasted bun, the zingier filling, a pair of gherkins, and (off to one side) a one-ounce bag of Ruffles mark this as a standard-bearer of sloppiness.

This upstate family farm relies on the efforts of several generations of \"mice,\" as they call themselves, to prepare preserves, garlics, and pickles.

A friend of mine remembers a street cart operated by father-and-son team, name of Greenberg, who sliced servings from a whole pickled watermelon, even during New York winters; the Grey Mouse version (16 oz.; $8) makes do with the rind, although some fiery-colored traces of the flesh remain.

Spacious 24-hour Korean market (though the short-order counter probably isn't open 'round the clock). From the ingredients of this item ($1.50) — flour, salt, sugar, baking powder, butter, and eggs — I expected dessert on a stick. From its shape, I should have identified the one ingredient that was listed much less clearly: a hot dog.

(This venue is closed.) Decent sized, sometimes a little doughy, not distinctively sour, salty, or sweet — Pick a Bagel's version is pretty standard for Manhattan. More tempting is their all-white cookie ($2), which lacquers an intensely sweet vanilla shell on a slightly spongy base. Sure, it's no work of art, but it's just the thing when you're craving a sugar hit. Pick a Bagel200 West 57th St. (at Seventh Ave.)(one of several locations)212-957-5151

Orange-A-Peel (shown; large; $5.65) blends orange juice, frozen strawberries, frozen bananas, and ice into nonfat frozen yogurt. Nice, even if the strawberry flavor was overwhelmed, and very filling. Another time, Mango-a-Go-Go (small; $3.95) blended passion fruit juice, mango juice, mangos, pineapple sherbet, and ice. The only flavors that surfaced from the thick slush were mango and pineapple; tasty, even so. Jamba JuiceMany locations

The red paper covering the windows may add a cheery glow, but that's still paper covering the windows. Long before there was a Little Senegal in West Harlem — 17 years ago, in fact — Keur N'Deye began serving the food of that West African nation in the Fort Greene section of Brooklyn. It's closing for good, said co-owner Salif Cisse on Wednesday evening, noting matter-of-factly that a number of high-end residential developments will open soon within sight of the restaurant. Salif and his wife, Marie, have no plans to move Keur N'Deye or, for the time being, to open another restaurant; after a long run, they plan to take a break from the business.

Well I have to say that Chapines Bakery is a place were I could find tipical food and bread that I didn't even remember from my country. Thanks to this website I found it and the bread was really good and the chuchitos,tamales and chiles rellenos. This bakery is the best piece of place that will transport you to Guatemala congratulations to the Bakery. Although i couldn't find it right away because their adress change to 171-06  jamaica Queens New York. I really recommend this place for the central american and defenitly the chapines.

(This venue is closed.) Pancit guisado (Pan-sit gwee-Sah-doe; $7.95) was one of several pancit variations on the menu of this Filipino restaurant and bakeshop. In Spanish, \"guisado\" means \"stew,\" but in the Philippines it refers to a dish sauteed in garlic, onion and tomatoes. Sadly, the bihon (thin rice noodles), sotanghon (cellophane noodles, made from mung beans) and canton (egg) noodles were stir-fried with \"sea legs\" and nearly flavorless chicken and shrimp, plus American-leaning vegetables including carrots, cabbage, and perhaps broccoli.

I'm not sure just why I walked in, but I'm glad I did.

My bowl of aloo mutter (\"potatoes and peas\"), the well-known Punjabi dish that also includes onion, tomato, and various zippy flavorings, was just $2.50.

Nice to see you've done so much work around 169th, but you are severely ignoring the Bangladeshi community! Eat at Ghoroa now! 169th is almost entirely Bangladeshi now and they've pushed out many of the earlier groups that were set up there (the Guyanese for ei have virtually no presence in comparison.) Ghoroa is priced similarly to Sunshine, but with a powerful emphasis on fish. If you're nice and they know you, then you can pretty much choose how much you want to pay (for ei. I paid 4.50 for a dinner for two the other night. Shutki, rice, kerala, and a mango lassi all in larger than normal portions.)

They're wafer-thin: Think of panelle as little panels of deep-fried chickpea flour, a popular snack all by themselves at this old-timey café-restaurant. Put 'em on a bun and lay on the ricotta, and you've got the panelle deluxe ($4.60) for a little crunch, a little chew. I've also heard great things about Ferdinando's pasta con sarde (that is, sardines), a Sicilian dish that also features fennel, pine nuts, and dried grapes.

Hello from Seattle. My wife (then just my girlfriend) and I were doing the tourist thing by the Apollo (she's a jazz singer, so that's Mecca for her :)) -- we worked up a mean appetite with all of that walking. It was a freezing cold day in February of 2002 and we weren't about to hit a chain restaurant in Harlem! Then, Bam! We saw that sign and just knew that it was right up our alley. And it was - cozy, full of ethereal smells, windows steamed up with love and good cooking - and the great people working there? Pure charm - they made us out-of-towners feel like second cousins. Remember that old crusty sign on the wall that said \"Today's Special: Fish\" - That cracked me up, as if it were only \"Today's\" special - it looked like it had been there for all of 40 years! M&G's had more life and character than you could ever ask for. In my mind, that's what Harlem looks like. It's a pity that I can't bring my young daughter there one day. I hope there is some of \"old Harlem\" left for us some day when we go back. Sad.

Despite having a jaded palate, there's just nothing this transplanted New Yorker likes as much as a half-dozen onion-laden \"sliders\" from White Castle. Nearly every time we visit Manhattan, we hop over the 59th Street Bridge and visit the White Castle on Northern Boulevard in Queens, (half-way to Flushing).

An even tastier combo (not shown here) was fried sweet plantain with a savory sauce that blended vegetables and a little smoked herring.

I ate there a couple of times.  It is missed.  Tangy curries, home cooking style and atmosphere.  From the size you might guess there were few seats: 4 or 6 bar stools along counters just inside the entrance.  In pleasant weather I took my food to go and went to a bench in the small park across the street.  I don't think I have photo of the food. Too bad, would like to have something to contrast with the abandoned deshevel of the closed building.  By the way, it seemed to me that the \"Best BBQ\" part of the sign referred back to a Puerto Rican restaurant that was there before the Indonesians.

The rugelach at this Hungarian bakery ($14 per pound), lovingly assembled with walnuts, raisins, and raspberry or apricot jelly, is wonderful off the shelf, and amazing if you have the good fortune to arrive when they're still warm. On the Upper East Side, the owners operate a snug café. For a prix fixe dinner ($22.95), my cold cherry soup, cucumber salad with paprika and vinegar ($2 extra), stuffed peppers, and apricot-and-nut palacsinta, or crepe, each struck familiar but comforting notes. Though the entrée must be smaller, the prix fixe lunch is just $12.95, and simply stopping in for coffee and one of the many tempting pastries would run you even less.

The space that once held Argentine steakhouse Pampa, which closed earlier this year, has been rechristened La Rural after the annual agricultural livestock show in the Palermo neighborhood of Buenos Aires. The menu is still meat-intensive — from the very first appetizer, matambre, a \"hunger killer\" of veal stuffed with spinach, carrots, and hardboiled egg, though the typical parrillada of mixed grilled meats for two — but also offers an expanded roster of non-carnivorous options.

\"The unusual number of blemishes on the apples this year are not caused by insects or diseases,\" according to the folks at Greenmarket regular Samascott Orchards, out of Kinderhook, New York, in a notice above a bin of Idareds. \"Rather they are art work performed by mother nature in the form of a hailstorm on May 31. The apples were only slightly larger than peas at that time but the wind-driven sharp edged hail cut and bruised many of the young fruits. Most of the blemishes are only skin deep and do not effect [sic] the eating quality of the apples.\"

I was certain that my blog was the only place in the world that found Los Vecinos Meat Market.
These guys do a great job of slicing your meat on demand.  I use them for chili beef, and they cube very reasonably priced beef, and sell most everything else I need for chili.

It's unclear whether J.M. Horton — which was acquired by Borden in the late 1920s — actually operated a business at this location. According to The New York Times, the inscriptions on many of these pediments were intended as advertisements directed at passengers on the Columbus Ave. elevated train. Also known as the Ninth Ave. El, it reportedly stood, at least in part, until the 1950s. Surviving signage from the J.M. Horton Ice Cream Co.302 Columbus Ave. (74th-75th Sts.), rooftop level

Hi there,

Just had to comment on this photo.  I walked by this building this evening (as I have at least a thousand times before) and for the first time noticed this sign.  I have lived in NYC for 20 years, and worked practically across the street for two years back in the late 1980's at a restaurant called Dobson's on the corner of 76th & Columbus, and I can't believe I never noticed it.  Anyway, came home and Googled the name and found your photo.  Thanks for posting.  Glad I found your website.

Every January 25 (and thenabouts), folks of Scottish descent celebrate the birth of the poet Robert Burns, especially by preparing and enjoying traditional dishes such as haggis with neeps and tatties — minced sheep's offal with turnips and potatoes. Kearny (Car-knee), New Jersey, is one of the few towns in the New York region with a sizable Scottish expat and Scots-American population, and its Argyle restaurant will be adding haggis to its casual-dining menu. A small party from The World Food Lovers Dining Out Group will gather there for an early dinner on Saturday, January 26; if you'd like to join us, we have a few seats available.

The on-again, off-again venture known as the J&L Mall seems to be gone for good, at least for the half-dozen or so food vendors who occupied the passageway to the right. A closer look at the signs (and translation by Brian S., a frequent contributor to the Chowhound message boards) reveals that the bing vendors from the front of J&L now sell their wares at the back of 41-40 Main St., the Guizhou stew vendor will be moving to 41-42, and another vendor has set up shop at 135-23 40th Rd.

The tousled noodles in my shio ramen (large; $7.99) were firmer than average; the roasted pork and other add-ins, including a fish cake, scallions, bamboo shoots, cloud-ear mushrooms, sesame seeds, and a pickled plum, were unexceptional. But the salt-flavored broth grew on me, and I finished off my ramen by drinking from the bowl. SantoukaIn the Mitsuwa Marketplace595 River Rd., Edgewater, New Jersey

It is a head-on view, so only two legs are visible. Her udder is visible between her two front feet. It might look like there are three rings in front of her face, but it is a set of jowls with a ring in the middle hooked into her nose. Note also the cow ears which a crab would not have.

I love walking on Liberty, underneath that elevated. It's one of NYC's most underappreciated scenes, for sure. I'm sure you came across two or three Chinese-West Indian joints; Jerk Chicken Fried Rice, anyone? Also, not far from the first Little Guyana Bake Shop, you might have noticed a store peddling Bollywood on the street, at ridiculously low prices, 3 for 12 bucks or something like that. Perhaps they raised their prices. Mae's definitely looks interesting.

Most of the menu belies the name. So does the setting; there's an ATM tucked in the corner of the seating area, just below a flatscreen silently piping news, trivia, and ads. But the room has a student café vibe (free Wi-Fi included), and the menu also includes gumbo, a po' boy stuffed with sausage or BBQ shrimp, and a muffuletta (Muff-uh-LOT-uh; $7). This toasty take on the New Orleans sandwich is served on squared-off foccacia and not the classic round loaf, it probably relies on store-bought olive salad, and I can't tell you what's what among the meat and cheese, but it was more satisfying than I had any right to expect.

IMAGINE THERE'S NO CAFÉ LA FORTUNA

It isn't hard to do with rents in the Lincoln Center area skyrocketing.  After many years as one of the most popular hangouts on Manhattan's Upper West Side, CAFÉ LA FORTUNA, famously frequented by John Lennon and Yoko Ono, IS CLOSING ITS DOORS FOR GOOD ON FEBRUARY 28, 2008.  Its walls are crammed with photographs and playbills; many of them autographed by musical luminaries of the past: Caruso, Rubinstein and Marian Anderson.  The small round table which had been displayed in the window case for the past 25 years since John Lennon's death was used by John and Yoko and was given to Ms. Ono last year as a gift from the owner, Mike Trapani.  Ben Affleck and Bill Clinton are the most recent celebrities to grace the institution as evidenced by a photograph of the former President and a T-shirt autographed by the actor.  Anyone wishing to say good bye to the old place had better hurry.  Strawberry Fields may be forever, but not Café la Fortuna.

Sometimes you see a lot just by looking. I was passing through the neighborhood about a week ago when I spotted a curious-looking establishment down the block -- something like Lincoln Logs in blonde wood. I'd forgotten about Ippudo entirely, but there it was, with their \"soft opening\" hours posted right in the window, and I made it a point to stop back in for a bowl (on my way to dinner). 

Expect to wait, even if you arrive early. Have fun!

There's isles, and then there's aisles. Apart from a passable produce section, the countries represented by all those flags have less to show for themselves at Fine Fare than its size would suggest. Foska Oats (400 g.; $1.49), has been around in Jamaica for many years, but as you've gathered, its first home was farther north.

When the topping is as moist as on this tomato-and-pesto focaccia ($1.75), you'll appreciate a crust that's especially crisp. Not big, but a nice bite. I don't know that I'll venture the pasta menu at this tiny Southern Italian joint -- despite a couple of tables, they seem set up mainly for takeout -- but I'll definitely have a go at the heroes.

Believe it or not you can get drinks at Crif Dog but only when their hidden bar PDT is in operation. You can access it through one of the phone booths inside. Pretty cool concept though I've never been. Check out my East Village Food Tour for more on Crif Dogs & some other great spots:

Inexpensive, too, though the selection is small. Coco Rico coconut soda (12 fl. oz.; about 75 cents), from Puerto Rico, is mildly flavored; nothing special.

Dave Cook

Taking pictures of street signs and the like has helped me retrace my steps, too, Annamatic. If I look at my Flickr photostream for a particular day, usually I can figure out where a shot was taken by looking at the photos it's \"between.\" When I'm on very unfamiliar territory, though, I'll take a visual \"note\" by snapping a photo of the nearest street sign, established business, or other landmark, in context if possible. Since these photos are intended as notes, usually they're very rough, so I keep them private on Flickr. I can dig out the details, though, for anyone who asks.

Only one soup was available when I stopped by this Jamaican outpost, so cow cod, fish tea, and a conch soup enhanced with shrimp, red snapper, and doctor fish must await another visit. A small serving of soup named for gungu peas (also called pigeon peas; $3) was bolstered considerably by chunks of tubers, a doughy round dumpling, and a pair of fatty slices of (my best guess) cow skin. Kind of a rough neighborhood; if you don't know your way around, try it for lunch rather than dinner. Blue Mountain Cuisine3701 Eastchester Rd.

While visiting a dear friend on the upper west side in August (she is a long time concierge at some of NYC's finest hotels), she recommended Sookk's.  She and I had a marvelous meal of tasty appetizers, while my son ordered and enjoyed a terrific green curry dish.  Presentation was classy and simple.  It was so good, that when I returned in September, I took my wife there for the most wonderful, inexpensive lunch.  My friend was right.  This is a jewel of a restaurant with great service, nice atmosphere, and reasonably priced.

It's still \"coming soon,\" and that same sign remains stuck to the window, but when I stopped by on Tuesday, the interior was reasonably well-furnished and free of construction debris, and several folks were chatting off to one side. The lady who came to the door told me that she expected Cambodian Cuisine -- which pulled up stakes in Fort Greene nearly two years ago -- to open in its new home in four weeks. This long-suffering Brooklyn transplant has gone through many fits and starts, so the lady's sunny attitude was especially encouraging; at the very least, she seems to be a believer. Realistically, I can't hope for anything like the freewheeling food scene I found in Phnom Penh, but if Cambodian Cuisine simply lives up to its name, I'll be more than happy.

***CONTENT
After a couple of anxious months without a home, Grillin' On The Bay is back for 2008. On June 7, the city's only contest sanctioned by the New England Barbecue Society will be held on the grounds of (and for the benefit of) St. Mark School, at East 18th St. and Ave. Z, in Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn. This year's competition is limited to grilling, in the categories of chicken breast, fish, pork, and \"chef's choice.\" Though the event is sponsored by RUB: Righteous Urban BBQ -- which makes what may be the best burnt-end dinner in town -- the barbecue competition won't return till 2009, alas. Prospective competitors can find more information at www.grillinonthebay.org. Folks who love great grilled food will find more information here, as June approaches.

From a block away, I reckoned that the garage-like space at street level could hold two or three picnic tables, easy. You're way ahead of this story, though: Louise's is so long gone that neither the Mexican laborers on the ground floor, nor the office workers one flight up, could say when \"soul food\" had said goodbye.

They can be any kind you can imagine. I grew up outside New York, but not far from it, so in my case you could have called them 'burber burgers.

Family cookout
Behind me, sizzle and smoke —
I can see burgers

is my preferred version. \"Sizzling patties...I can see burgers\" renames them for the reader but suggests that the poet has seen nothing new. \"Behind me, sizzle and smoke\" implies that the poet has turned about and, like the reader, experienced the delight of recognition.

Memorial Day wasn't the time to find yourself in Boerum Hill or Carroll Gardens with a craving for whoopie pies. But when One Girl Cookies reopens on Thursday, May 29, after a three-day makeover, the Dean St. bakery will expand into a new room with indoor seating, side by side with its neighbor Bar Tabac. Perhaps you still won't find a sidewalk table with parking for your scooter, but then again, you'll never enjoy a whoopie pie at Bar Tabac -- and often, it's those little things that matter most.

Surinamese food is an EXELLENT and amazingly unique mixure that wonderfully reflects its multi-etnic population.
A lot of wonderful crossovers between food traditions and spices from 5 continents in a tasty blend is something that has to be promoted world wide. :)
I hope the other etnic mixes like the Surinamese Chinese, Surinamese Creole, Surinamese African, Surinamese Hindustan, Surinamese Amer-Indian etc. etc. dishes are also possible in more world cities.

p.s. if you cant pronounce these sweets maybe you should show them what I wrote and if the foods good you can say: \"Jempol\" (that means thumbs up)

It's all about the Sicilian slice at Vinny Vincenz. The margarita is definitely good, but the Sicilian's where it's at, crispy, airy, light and delicious. Almost exemplary.

(This remembrance was sent to me by a reader, Orestes Gonzalez, following my recent posts on Luang Prabang and Vientiane. In addition to making a few minor typographical edits, I've omitted the name of \"the lady,\" to protect her privacy.) Thanks for the memories of Laos. I was there in 2000, coming from Siem Reap. I got there on a Friday night, with $5 in my pocket (couldn't find any money changers in transit). The airport, newly remodeled, had no money changers open, as my flight was the last one (and had been delayed several hours). The hotel I stayed at wouldn't change traveler's checks (I walked the ten blocks to get to it) or accept credit cards, so I was basically stuck for the weekend, without cash, until the banks opened on Monday. I guess I would eat fried caterpillars for the next two days.

But one time my wife and I had to hike along the shoulder of a disgusting highway with bombed-out cars and garbage strewn everywhere in the dirty snow. Plus there were still crackheads everywhere.

I have always thought that the original Wondee (a few blocks down) showed superior care and flavor all through the menu - especially the entrees - than Wondee II.

2007-12-20 10:38:00
I agree, even if the lighting can be nearly as stark as a laundromat (lately, they've turned it down) and the restroom is accessible only via the kitchen. Thanks, too, for calling an error to my attention. The address in this post is for the original Wondee (where, sadly, my most recent entrees were uninspired), but at the end of the post I'd previously labeled it as Wondee II. That's now corrected.

Dave,
Your Laos series is fascinating, perhaps your best yet. Beautiful photographs. My wife's brother, who has made a life of rucksacking pretty much all over the world for months on end, commented that out of all of the southeast asian countries, he liked Laos the best because the people were so warm and generous. If he was sitting on a hot, crowded bus next to some guy who was chowing down on a snack, the guy would give him some. That kind of thing. What was your experience?

By the way, the quail eggs look good.

\"Black rice with seafood\" is Boca Chica's translation of chofan, a Dominican version of Chinese fried rice, heavy on the soy sauce. It's often a last home for leftovers, and scooped from the window display, this chofan (small; $4) was a tad dry. But when time permits, there's much more I'd like to try from the extensive menu at this tiny seafood specialist: white snapper ceviche, \"fish filet in coconut,\" maybe even the grouper stuffed with seafood. Timing may be tricky: You'd expect to come across several cooks, with various levels of skill, at a place that's open 24 hours.

For the thrift-minded restaurant that doesn't need another business-card holder or soap dish, let alone any more ashtrays, here's another thought for those calcium carbonate castoffs. The more customers these signs attract, of course, the more clamshells will pile up in the kitchen, so rather than let perfectly good shells go to waste, best to keep all your options open.

At the food bazaar outside the Al-Hikmah mosque, sometime between my combro and my cendol, I sat down with a few fellows to talk about their idea of authentic Indonesian food. In Queens, Whitney Ave. neighbors Mie Jakarta and Minangasli each got a mention, and surprisingly, so did Bali Nusa Indah, on Ninth Ave. in Manhattan. When I asked the fellows about the best of the lot, though, Upi Jaya was the unhesitating consensus choice; from what I gathered, the others don't even come close.

When I arrived in the afternoon, the street was lightly decorated in Brazilian colors, a lively pop group was playing for several hundred spectators, and a handful of stalls were offering food and drink.

The prices here are killer. I wasn't a huge fan of the sesame seed noodles (just didn't have the palette for it), but I loved the dumplings -- one dozen for $4.50! Plus the bun dumplings are fantastic (were $1, but have gone up to $1.25). Nice pics!

The restaurant is under new management. The menu consisted of only a few types of steamed buns so far. The cold sesame noodles were one of my favorite dishes in Flushing. Has the lady who managed Yi Pin moved to another location?

Thanks for the word, John, bad news though it is. (Now I especially regret not following Polecat's lead and circling back for the thistle dumplings.) I don't know where the former owner might have moved, but I posted a query on Chowhound, and perhaps a reader there (or here) can tell us more.

I also ordered a cup of teh tarik (Tay ta-Reek; 75 cents), tea that is \"pulled\" — poured from a height, with arms spread wide — to froth it manually. At this tiny specialty-food stall, however, that's done through the much more compact gestures of tearing and pouring from an instant-mix packet.

You can buy \"tape ketan putih\" fermented white sticky rice, similar to the black sticky rice you posted above, at chinese grocery stores, Topline, Hongkong supermarket among others.  It is sold in clear glass jars in refrigerated sections, probably made in China. The texture is much lighter or spongier and it has a lot more liquid. I don't like it as much, but ....a handy substitute.
You can make your own at home. Steam the sticky rice, cool it off, sprinkle some yeast (ragi) also available in Topline supermarket, put it in a tightly covered non-corrosive/non-aluminum container at room-temp in a dark place for 3 days. Check after 3 days. The longer it is kept, the more alcohol it produces.  Once it reaches the desired consistency, refrigerate it for longer shelf life.

Okay, now I have to try poodam's. First, catfish larb is a great dish (I have a recipe for it from Saveur if you're the cooking kind--it's not too difficult.) but mainly, that steamed curry fish has me intrigued. For one, I've never seen curry leaves in any thai cooking--so very curious. But more important, I too am searching for a thai \"holy grail\" dish--this sort of thai style \"deviled crab\" (no idea what it was called) that I had in a podunk restaurant in sriracha, thailand a few years back. Somehow, the picture and description of the curry fish makes it seem similar. Poodam's, here i come!

Thanks. It's hard to know just what was used: The separate, English-language ingredients label is headed \"pumpkin sweet paste with coconut,\" but the translators who prepare these labels often take an expedient approach. \"Pumpkin\" looks friendly and familiar to American eyes -- and if you hollow it out, like a jack-o-lantern or a matryoshka (Russian nesting doll), you can fit the other gourds inside. Perhaps figuratively, in this case.

That's disappointing.  They certainly aren't generous with the servings at these street fairs.  Not good for business.  $4 is a lot for ice cream too.  I tend to try to eat before I go so I'm not walking around hungry.  I always wind up disappointed when I think something is going to be really good.

Ooh La La. It's A Love Thing! And if gluttonous is a sin, then I am guilty.

Now I see why folks are raving about Alvin's delicious All- Natural culinary creations, because this is Thriller.

Yes. His Ice cream will turn you and your buddies into a Thrilla Vanilla Believer like me.  And it will have you smacking back to a little taste of Heaven

From Alvin's Sweet Potato Pie ice cream, all the way down to his robust Coffee Break, it's so amazingly great you will lick your lips until it drips. 

Ooh La La, is what you will say, after feasting on his healthy delicious sorbets, full-flavored Vermont Maple Walnut, Red-Velvet Ice Cream and other yummy for your tummy treats. So velvety smooth and alluringly succulent, that Ice cream lovers will always know their money is well spent.

Come to think of it, I'm going to place my order today, by calling Alvin at 413-787-1831.

The outdoor vendors near the southeast corner of Mulberry and Canal offer some of the best-looking exotic fruits in Manhattan; on a recent summer afternoon you could have lingered over mangosteen, guava, dragon fruit, star fruit, sugar apple, rambutan, lychee, and longan. But just around the corner was an even rarer sight.

I hope they still have them.  I have been looking for a jackfruit since I had one in Jamaica in 2001 and Cambodia & Thailand in 2002.  I go into the New Kam Man store all the time to get dried jackfruit since I can't ever find one fresh.
Yay, jackfruit!

The parade makes its way up Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Blvd., and toward 125th St., on the shadier, west side of the avenue, a number of the usual fried-food and lemonade vendors set up shop. On the eastern side of the avenue, many more ad hoc vendors offered much the same, though I did spy one elaborate setup, adjacent to a church, where whole racks of ribs were splayed on several oil-drum grills. One avenue to the east, on Lenox, several Jamaican stalls featuring typical island fare huddled near 125th St. Just north of the Jamaicans, I spotted the flag of St. Kitts and Nevis, seldom seen near a food stand except at the West Indian Day Parade. The \"Laurel & Anell booth\" doesn't run a restaurant, and the menu was shorter than on Labor Day (no ducana, no conch), but I happily had at a small portion ($7) of curry goat and the cornmeal-based flatbreads called johnnycakes.

That's not chocolate, said a passer-by, who recalled when a pizza parlor stood on this site some 30 years ago. After the Italian eatery gave way to a Chinese restaurant (though perhaps not the same restaurant shown below), the ice cream's original white sheen slowly acquired a patina that looks very much like deep dark soft-swirled goodness. In fact, it was and is vanilla -- now coated with a decades-long Bronx dip. Surviving \"Eat-It-All\" ice cream cone signageAbove Foo Hing Chinese Kitchen522 East 138th St., Mott Haven, Bronx

Dave Cook

For laksa lamak, the version I know best,visit Taste Good, where it's called kari laksa. Assam laksa I don't know as well, so although it appears on numerous menus in New York, I don't have a recommendation for you. Johor laksa, and laksam, generally can't be found in the city, but beginning in mid-February the delegate's dining room at the United Nations will be holding a food festival at lunchtime that will celebrate the cuisine of Johor. Though no substitute for a visit to the Malay Peninsula, it's worth visiting at least once for the opportunity to rub elbows at the buffet.

You'd hope a blacktop playground wouldn't be so hot this time of year, but there you go. Of some two dozen tables staffed by local eateries, just two tempted cash from my wallet. Above, a $3 sampler plate from Rajbhog Sweets (where, naturally, I've usually been enticed by the sweets) offered several reasons to revisit its Gujarati-style savory dishes. Most notable: khandvi, pasta-like yellow rolls made from gram flour, and patra, steamed and spiced disks of colocasia (Co-lo-CAY-she-uh), which may simply be a fancy name for taro leaves. Below, a $3 sampler from the Thakali Kitchen included (clockwise from left) a rosy hot sauce, fried flatbread, a pair of the meat dumplings called momo, and aloo dam -- the Tibetan equivalent of hash browns.

This longtime deli/bakery/caterer prepares the softer style of black-and-white cookie ($2.25); as at Leske's Bakery, still-moist frosting perches on a spongy base. Because it travels more easily, the \"hardshell\" variety -- as at Nussbaum & Wu -- is much easier to track down in New York, and you can find it in several variations (I'm fond of all-vanilla). But sometimes there's good reason to make the trek to Brooklyn Heights: If you want to \"get in your licks,\" only a softie like this will do.

If you enjoy my photographs of signage, streetscapes, and urban oddities, have a gander at Counter/Culture: The Disappearing Face of Brooklyn's Storefronts, on exhibit through December 28 at the Brooklyn Historical Society. You can get a taste for the exhibition at the society's website (note the extensive list of audio tracks at the bottom of the page) and at the website of photographers James and Karla Murray. Admission to the historical society is $6 ($4 for students and seniors). To get the biggest bang for your buck, you might want to visit on November 19, at 6:30 (I'll remind you), when you'll also be able to enjoy a talk by the Murrays and several of the store owners, and a slideshow that will present many images that simply couldn't fit in the society's gallery.

If you find yourself on upper Bergenline Ave. with a taste for ice cream, chances are you already know Mark's very well. From a double-wide freezer case filled with the usual suspects, I chose one of the few unusual varieties, mamey (mah-May; small cup; $1.95). Sadly, that pinkish-orange blush wasn't matched by much flavor of the fruit itself -- it had a slightly grainy texture, too, though not unpleasantly so -- but on a summery day, I was able to enjoy it in North Hudson Park, across the street.

I get the rotisserie chicken. The smashed potatoes are just simply mashed, but ultra creamy. I do like the fact that they serve vinegar on the table. But too bad about the cornbread, I haven't tried it there. But there Arnold Palmer, made with peach ice tea and lemonade is quite addictive. Thanks for the review.

I always pass this place, (or used to at least) and never entered. It looks pretty good. I guess everyone goes to Carmine's or Tony's up the street. But I think now I have to try it.

Dave,
'Superior Market
40-08 Queens Boulevard, which you wrote about under 'SUNNYSIDE' also sells good rugelach. They don't skimp on the dried fruit. Buy the rugelach when the pile is still high, which means they are fresh(er). When there aren't many left, they're not as flaky.  The spinach pies are good too, especially earlier in the day.

\"...Uneeda biscuit.\" That slogan for the first brand of prepackaged biscuits was devised in the late 1800s, not long after the merger that created the National Biscuit Company, later called Nabisco. This sign, which also trumpets \"the national soda cracker,\" may have been painted several years after the turn of the century. A very close look (which I saw only after the fact; click on the photo above) also revealed an owl statue that's less than effective at keeping the roofline pigeon-free.

This newly opened noodle shop is a sister restaurant to Minca, which I've never visited, though I understand the menu is much the same. Apart from a short list of appetizers (a plate of gyoza, pan-fried dumplings that were headed to another customer, awaits a return visit), the lineup features a dozen varieties of ramen, all with \"sliced stewed pork and some mountain vegetables,\" prepared with a choice of five noodle styles. (A thirteenth, higher-priced, \"special\" entry, kimchi miso ramen, is listed without further explanation or options; apparently, you know it or you don't.) Prepared with wavy wheat noodles, wahoo sio ramen ($9.50) sat in a chicken broth (wahoo?) flavored with salt (pronounced, and usually spelled, shio) and roast scallion (whose aroma I found off-putting). Perhaps it's an authentic Japanese variation on this style -- Kambi's basic pork sio broth, and the pork-and-chicken sio, are tweaked with roast garlic -- but it's not for me. Perhaps I should get to know that kimchi miso. Kambi Ramen House351 East 14th St. (1st-2nd Aves.)212-288-1366Closed Monday

Although transforming the space left by the prior tenant (a Mediterranean restaurant and lounge called Loft) required much more work than first anticipated, he now expects that the new Kefi will open in two to three weeks.

For an institutional cafeteria, the food is quite good, and the sunny staff helps compensate for the windowless, virtually undecorated dining area (in a blocky building -- hence the nickname -- that's equally free of embellishment).

Ça ne s'appele pas des dumplings, en effet?
Dave Cook
2009-01-09 11:30:00
According to Google's translation page, this reads:

It is not called the dumplings, indeed?

My answer, first in English and then translated by Google:

Many Chinese venues distinguish buns (which are typically thicker-skinned) from dumplings, but the distinction isn't always clear. For me, it's easier simply to take these venues at their word, at least until I'm better versed in Mandarin.

Beaucoup de sites chinois distinguer des petits pains (qui sont généralement à peau épaisse) de dumplings, mais la distinction n'est pas toujours claire. Pour moi, c'est simplement plus facile de prendre ces lieux à leur terme, au moins jusqu'à ce que je suis mieux versés en mandarin.

Will it stay or will it go? House of Spices is the largest manufacturer and distributor of Indian food in the United States and the second-largest landowner in the \"Iron Triangle\" of Willets Point, Queens. Although the business has agreed to sell its four-acre plot to the city's Economic Development Corp., recent accounts in The New York Observer and Crain's New York Business suggest that House of Spices will remain where it is, at least while development (read: auto-repair-shop relocation) proceeds on the acreage closer to the new Mets stadium. When House of Spices does sell its land to a developer -- at a higher price than it could now, you'd think, based on improvements to the neighboring real estate -- one possible new location would be in Hunts Point, in the Bronx, which House of Spices called home about two decades ago.

On the tail end of the lunchtime rush at this blue-collar Peruvian eatery, the last lonely papa rellena didn't win me over, and the chicken noodle soup seemed skimpy. (Later, from my stool at the narrow counter near the display case, I saw that each murky yellow pint concealed a hardboiled egg.)

Lovely charred highlights, though, that were almost as endearing as the \"donde vivimos\" paper placemat.

We used to get the Fancy butter cookies at Tulip, some of the most awesome ones I ever tasted in my life.

However I believe it changed owners a few years ago and the cookies lost some of their luster, cheaper ingredients I would assume.

Floral Park was one of the first planned communities.  It was placed on the site of a large flower farm, thus the name of the town and the streets.  My mom (now 84) was born and raised there and my grandma lived there her whole life.  The Tulip bakery was a major part of trips to Grandma's.  It was a German Bakery when I was little (50+yrs ago), it was subsequently sold (along with the recipes that the new owners scrupulously follow proving one doesn't mess with perfection).  They have several kinds of Rye bread along with the usual other fare.  One type of the rye was called Koenigs' and was a staple at the German place that still stands and operates as far as I know.  The Tulip Bakery is the real deal.  Small town Main Street USA.  The best.  Oh!  Don't miss the jelly donuts!

Is this the little storefront that's on the same block, literally a few paces down Hillside, from the Fiza Diner?

The bakery I'm thinking of is called New Usha Sweets and Snacks, and it's worthy of mention for the Lilva and Mugdal Kachoori I had the other day. Five to a bag, for a buck each. Excellent combination of sweet and spicy, with not too much of the former and enough of the latter to sneak up on you when you least expect it.

This place is just up the road from Fiza, and like many businesses it seems to go by more than one name, depending on whether you look at the awning, or the menu, or the business card. I went by the awning, but if you have any doubt, look for the cupola.

Dave,
I just got back from an extended lunch hour at Mumbai Express, after which I hit Usha Foods. This is not the place I was thinking of, which is actually called New Usha Sweets and Snacks, and is on the same block/same side of Hillside as Fiza is.

That venue is worth a visit next time you're in the hood, but Usha Foods merits return trips as well. I got some pink and orange cham chams as well as a bag of Lilva Kachoori. I'm partial to the Kachoori. Would definitely like to try their lunch options some day - they seem interesting.

It's a good place to drink beer and, yes, get decent oysters. Their menu varies but I once happened to catch their green salad with fried oysters special--a huge, perfectly dressed mixed green salad served with six deep fried, fresh oysters. Holy crap.  Delicious. Also, a good place to take a visiting friend in the summer. Cool and air conditioned. A Brooklyn lager or a bloody mary and a green salad, maybe a few oysters at 1 pm? Can't beat it as a break from the heat.

Even the \"single\" sized serving of this Japanese joint's katsu curry ($7.50) provided a sliced-up slab of panko-crusted pork cutlet atop a nearly equal expanse of white rice. Both found comfort in a pool of heavy, black-peppery sauce that made the merest nod toward sweetness. White shreds of cabbage offered crunchy contrast; so did a bright red heap of fukujinzuke ($1), a traditional accompaniment of soy-sauce-pickled radish. Go! Go!

Rather, this appetizer of fried Rhode Island squid ($9) is sourced from the Ocean State; the tender curls of calamari are surmounted by two disks of fried (and fully edible) Meyer lemon.

Pack this much gooey filling in a handheld pastry, and it might collapse of its own weight. This small Greek food shop sensibly plants its phyllo-covered custard pie (slice; $3) on a sturdy crust, then casually pushes the sugar-saturation limit with a light pour of lemon syrup.

...or shrimp with garlic (gambas al ajillo): Either way you look at this classic tapa, writes Boqueria, they're two more great tastes that go great together.

You really need to try the croissants at the HPS, as my friends and I fondly refer to it. They are by far the best I've ever had. I agree with you about the coffee and so far none of the other pastries have rated too high in my opinion. But as Morningside Heights practically lacks in coffee shops that allow you tp linger and work all day, the HPS is this local's favorite!

Taking playful liberties with lettering is a common technique -- you've seen it applied to fire and ice -- but it's not exclusive to the Roman alphabet. As confirmed for me by the former owner of this restaurant (today he operates another, which also serves the cuisine of his home country), the script seen on this restaurant awning is accompanied by decorative flourishes; taken as a whole, the logo both spells and depicts the name of the restaurant. Can you Identify it? (Please post your answer in the comments.)

Tacos árabes are cousins to tacos al pastor; both are name-checked on this awning (click the photo for a better look). Like the kibbeh that became a quipe, the árabes are a product of Lebanese immigrants, in this case to the Mexican city of Puebla. Reportedly, they're wrapped in thicker, pita-like tortillas than tacos al pastor, perhaps with a different salsa, too; when I have time for a side-by-side tasting, you'll see them here.

Nevertheless I will make it a point to have a meal with my family there whenever I'm in Penang.

haha- I had a similar experience before in Flushing. In my definition, Laksa was the coconut curry broth noodle and when walking into a Malaysian restaurant in Flushing, I ordered one to go. While I thought the soup color was a bit peculiar (dark brown), I didn't put much thought into it. When arrived at home, I was quite surprised with what I got - sadly I ended up throwing out most of them. Later Wiki search proved there are two kinds of Laksa indeed and the one I got was tamarind & fish broth type. I learned my precious lesson of Laksa then.

\"Drugs.\" \"BBQ.\" From a distance, it's much easier to spot the vibrant vintage Rexall typography than the skinny neon sign above the entrance. But open the door and take in the scent of slow-cooked 'cue; if what ails you is hunger, Baby Blues might well be able to dispense the cure. I had the contrary complaint: Too little time, too little capacity. Love that signage, though.

Despite the name this expansive market seems to be Chinese-run; though I did spot a cluster of Filipino snacks and baked goods, \"MOM\" offers nowhere near the variety you'll find at Phil-Am Foodmart. On the other hand, apparently they supply provisions for the Hue cuisine at Ngoc Mai, where I spotted the market's calendar several days later; the many aisles of packaged goods, hailing from all across Asia, are accompanied by extensive arrays of meat and seafood; and in the produce section I came upon chunks of langka, or jackfruit ($2.39 per pound unhusked). It was less fragrant than my first fresh jackfruit -- once the husk is split, I imagine that the aroma, and flavor, tail off quickly -- but at least I didn't need to travel nearly so far to enjoy it.

This is great news. There used to be a hand-pulled noodle stall in Flushing in a mini-mall on Main Street, but I believe they weren't there the last time we looked.
This new place is located just right for us, as we also like to buy the almond cookies at Nom Wah Tea Parlor, just up Doyers St. Nom Wah's are the only jumbo almond cookies we've found that are still made with lard. A guilty pleasure!

If you're reading this post you've almost certainly seen my photo of Ruth Ades-Laurent here on Eating In Translation. Perhaps you've also seen it on Serious Eats, on Gothamist, and (misattributed, not for the first time) on Grub Street. Today my photo appears in the print and online editions of the New York Post, which also reports that you can purchase your own peeler from the daughter of beloved pitchman Joe Ades at the Union Square Greenmarket on Saturdays, weather permitting. My photo was also featured on NY1's daily roundup In The Papers, where it appears in the closing item. Note, though, that the family name is properly pronounced \"Ah-dess.\"

My mouth watered when I read \"Lobster Casino.\" What a great idea! Too bad Marisa's only created a lackluster version. I plan to create my own version at home. I envision the two halfs of the shells, meat scooped out, cut into chunks and put back in, swimming in bacon, tomato hunks, roasted red pepper, onion, garlic, olive oil and pancetta, all with a lightly browned edge from being run under the broiler...

I'm not sure exactly which place you mean, but I'd be surprised if it ever served chicken and ribs, let alone advertised itself with an old door from a Frigidaire. Sorry, that's not it.

Sorry worng place.  Cirhette is down the street.  I believe this was the original Brothers BBQ spot before they moved across the street.
Dave Cook
2009-03-20 10:36:00
Well, now that you mention Brothers, I'm not sure. I'd thought that the door, like the painted sign facing Varick, advertised Martin's Bar & Grill, and that Brothers, a newer business, occupied an adjoining space on Houston before moving to Varick. (According to my 2001 Zagat's, Brother's had already crossed the avenue by that time.) Can anyone confirm who hung that fridge door?

Thanks very much, Rob.

From these links, dear readers (the \"chef and restaurant database\" especially), we see that Brothers occupied the space at 228 West Houston from 1991 to 1995; it then moved across the avenue to 225 Varick, where it served 'cue till it closed in 2006. Martin's stood at 228 West Houston before 1991  some decades before, to the best of my knowledge, since online databases go back only so far. 

Just who hung the fridge door, I still don't know.

***CONTENT
Each of the nine Greek goddesses known as the Muses is memorialized by a street in the Lower Garden District. From a literature class long ago, you might recall the name Melpomene, the muse of tragedy, but ask for directions using the Merriam-Webster pronunciation, and you'll earn the smile that locals everywhere bestow on hopeless tourists. You'll be pointed the right way, too, but I'd rather not be made to feel like a rube. (Note to self: Be more gracious the next time I'm asked for directions to Hyoos-ton St.) In New Orleans, Melpomene is Mel-puh-meen. Her sisters Calliope, Euterpe, and Terpsichore each also shed a syllable, while one variation for Clio is so bizarre I'd have to hear it to believe it. Read much more in this lexicon of New Orleans terminology and speech, from Chuck Taggart's engaging (and literate) Gumbo Pages.

How you doin'. I've just returned from a meatball-heavy event in Astoria. Two non-meatball items that left a lasting impression were gnocchi from L'incontro (apparently a special, like much of this nearby trattoria's ever-changing menu) and the ruby port flavor (new this year) from Wine Cellar Sorbets. As for reports on tonight's \"best meatball of the boroughs\" contest (not judged by me), I'll point you to my Twitter feed, www.Twitter.com/EIT, lately the repository of many brief items of passing interest. (As a handle, EatingInTranslation was too long; my compromise, EIT, you can spell out, pronounce as \"eat,\" or stretch into two syllables, as in Eid ul-Fitr, the festival of the fast-breaking that marks the end of Ramadan. I haven't decided which pronunciation I prefer.) You can always catch up with my tweets from the links in the sidebar of my website, but for up-to-the-minute reports (when I have them, which won't be always) on the weekend food festivals that are worth a visit, as well as the ones that aren't, you'll want to follow me on Twitter, too.

To clarify, after an email query from an Eating In Translation reader:

\"Unearthly IPA\" is Southern Tier's name for its international pale ale (IPA, one of many standard styles, like lager or pilsner). ABV means \"alcohol by volume\"; 11% ABV means it's strong, if not unearthly strong.

Despite the advance publicity, the only \"delicious Israeli cuisine\" to be found was a rather crumbly heap of falafel, with lettuce and hot sauce, in a pita ($5). Dogs, burgers, too. I had hopes for Brother to Brother, \"the most famous band of singers from Israel's National Army,\" when they proved to be a coed combo of twenty-somethings in olive drab, on guitar, bass, drums, and keyboard, with two female lead singers, but their sound check was so painfully long that that's all I heard.
